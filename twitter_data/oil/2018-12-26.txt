9 2018-12-26 23:58:56 @BretBaier Mr Baier, any news about the huge oil and gas discovery in Texas?  Is it true?  Thanks.
10 2018-12-26 23:58:52 I personally like the deep fryer because I am less likely to have splatter.  It is just a pain to drain, clean and put away so we use it at least three days at a time.  Now have one big enough for holiday turkeys and with peanut oil it is a game changer.
11 2018-12-26 23:58:50 What if we look at wti oil price movements of 10%+? Serious question on my part, sir.

38 2018-12-26 23:56:21 Beto voted to deregulate Wall Street. Beto hasn’t co-singed Medicare for all. Beto takes a lot of oil money. Beto voted with the Republicans against the CFPB. Beto doesn’t come close to Bernie.

41 2018-12-26 23:56:00 I’m in the habit of finding v cute little houses to buy, then talking myself out of them.. like “oh I wouldn’t want to send my kids to that school district or it doesn’t have a garage” knowing good & damn well I’m single with no kids and couldn’t change my cars oil if I tried

prevent oil wars
46 2018-12-26 23:55:05 How do you know that, because history shows Beto backed any pro oil policy (that increased their profits) that came through congress. I don’t think Beto cares about climate change & my beliefs are based on betos voting history.

50 2018-12-26 23:54:49 Why am I not surprised that Dems are taking more lobbyist money than Republicans? Reject all PAC & bundled maximum large dollar donations from Lobbyist, Oil, Gun Rights, Tobacco, Pharmaceutical, Hedge Fund, Defense, Telephone Utilities, Anti-Abortion and Banking interest groups.
51 2018-12-26 23:54:49 OR we could stop interfering in other nations for Corporate greed and hubris. That would save US Citizens; blood, treasure and lives, plus 200K others humans lives we have killed in the war for oil and power.
52 2018-12-26 23:54:47 Yall car radio sound louder after a oil change or fill up?
53 2018-12-26 23:54:35 He lifted oil export ban after huge unknown reserves discovered. He's in Texas. go figure. they quote his website: "Beto voted to repeal ban...to support our economy and national security."
54 2018-12-26 23:54:34 Well it's about time he started doing his job.

Does this also mean #Trump is going to stop taking money from those in the oil industry i.e. #Putin #SaudiArabia #KochBrothers so our military do not have to die over oil anymore?

61 2018-12-26 23:53:46 There is mathematical model  for Petro product pricing. Not arbitrary as you could be presuming.
It's the average oil price over 15 days is taken into account besides INR Vs $ movement.
That is why the decline or rise is not linear in line with Brent crude price

63 2018-12-26 23:53:13 I told you about columbite in the north a while ago... even aquamarine that Brazil is exporting, its in plateau state... our own is to die on oil money

70 2018-12-26 23:52:24 You dont have your facts straight.  Immigration is not responsible for wreaking havoc on environment or quality of life.  Republican policies which hurt the environment, such as deregulation and giving away federal lands to developers and oil Co’s, are responsible
71 2018-12-26 23:52:07 I really my just truck the next 10 days if these greedy oil companies would open their wells back up.

76 2018-12-26 23:51:43 Tea Tree oil gets stickers off really well.
77 2018-12-26 23:51:38 Our family certainly isn't Big Oil and we donated to Beto like crazy. Why? Because he embodies the spirit and ideals of the Democratic Party. He has a contagious, youthful optimism. And he's a true progressive.
78 2018-12-26 23:51:29 GND explicitly talks of taxing oil/gas profits which IS a carbon tax no matter what they call it, even if not based on carbon tons directly. Most energy cos are diversified & “profits” nebulous. Carbon emission based tax is only way to actually achieve what they describe.
79 2018-12-26 23:51:29 Same thing as payday loans. Just have to be taught  to avoid at all cost. Always gonna be people selling snake oil.

98 2018-12-26 23:48:47 I can see an electric car being designed to never need an oil change. Even can be set up with permanently sealed bearings so it never can be greased. But that just means it's a disposable unit, no repairability.

101 2018-12-26 23:48:25 Is there anybody who voted for Trump that thinks this is good?
Seriously does anybody who voted for Trump think this is a good development and one they approve of the only thing Russia has for sale is oil without oil they have nothing no money, and for yrs has been USA #1 enemy?
102 2018-12-26 23:48:16 It’s the thing that drills the hole that holds the spring that drives the rod that turns the knob that works the thing-ummy-bob and the thing that holds the oil that oils the ring that takes the shank that moves the crank that works the thing-ummy-bob.

Am I right?
103 2018-12-26 23:47:59 Interesting and I'm sure there is a lot to it combined with extreme oversold condition short term, so a big rally is not surprising.  Spike in oil prices helped too. Problem is that eventually many will realize that global growth has been due to global debt...has no organic base.

121 2018-12-26 23:45:17 I brown them slowly in just enough oil to cover the bottom, then remove them & sprinkle a layer of sugar on the oil & let it caramelize until it foams, then drop onions, garlic & bell pepper over that & cook them way down. Then roasts go back w/ water to simmer many hours.

134 2018-12-26 23:43:34 AB need not be poorer, but just refrain from blaming AB for mismanaging their oil revenue ... that was conducted by yes, some AB premiers, but mostly by federal government interference for the past 61 years.
135 2018-12-26 23:43:32 You cannot be serious. The levels of his corruption reach new lows almost daily lately. Him and seemingly everyone associated. He has hurt us by making us a laughing stock around the world. He has opened up our nation's parks to oil drilling. The stock market is in the tank....
136 2018-12-26 23:43:31 I'm from Iraq myself and I will tell you that they have already stolen the oil, gold and thousands of Iraqi artifacts. We Iraqis have also seen nothing from the oil, from 2005-2017 over 1 trillion dollars spent and we still dont have good electricty or clean water.
137 2018-12-26 23:43:24 @tracys why in the blue fuck does it take 11 hours to check the oil?
138 2018-12-26 23:43:23 So I think this article is overly cynical, but I like its criticism of "DT", which absolutely can look like a bunch of snake oil. We need to ask hard questions of our innovation initiatives, but I'm not ready to completely dismiss them as offering nothing new at all.

140 2018-12-26 23:43:01 Ok if one of the benefits of this particular essential oil I just put in the steamer thingy is that it helps with constipation, should I be worried if I don't have constipation?
141 2018-12-26 23:43:00 Most cargo/oil shipping is done by large majority male crews. These ships would be at significant risk of crashing into obstacles and depositing their cargo throughout the water. The result would be Exxon Valdez times a thousand.
142 2018-12-26 23:42:57 The real question is which essential oil will make me rich as fuck
143 2018-12-26 23:42:56 For me it’s that without it my throat gets hella sore. I have a little babby oil diffuser tho and it makes the good smells

146 2018-12-26 23:42:25 The Feds spent $4.5B on a pipeline that doesn't pay for itself & can't get expansion approval. Where do you think that $ went? QC? Working class AB? Nope, in to the hands of oil company elites. Look hard at where all the $ goes & don't forget to adjust for pop. differences.

Natural gas and oil are fossil fuels. Try again, troll.

152 2018-12-26 23:41:37 The USA never should have supported or propped up the nomadic kurds, except usa wanted oil in the region?, control of sovereign Syrian land. They should have policed the border at most. Instead of backing anybody that would go against Assad. #uspoli #USPolitics
153 2018-12-26 23:41:25 Umm better the government invest in worth while projects instead of weapons, coal or oil.

156 2018-12-26 23:40:48 We look at where the money comes from because it shows who has influence. Did Beto vote with oil/gas? Yes. Twice to lift the oil export ban. He voted against a bill preventing east gulf drilling. He voted to speed gas exports. Now we know he's not the leader we need.
157 2018-12-26 23:40:46 If fracking busts then you can pretty much think that 2018 is the highpoint of shale oil.  Possibly world oil could be lower 2019 as USA drove total world production higher. Interesting times.
158 2018-12-26 23:40:41 I get more excited about getting my oil changed and getting new windshield wipers than I do about getting clothes and presents.

160 2018-12-26 23:40:39 Sledder, you really shouldn’t be making absurd comments about incorrectly assessing the condition of something about which you clearly seem to know very little.

Look up Equalization Programme, 1980 oil tax by Pierre Trudeau.    You will find it less absurd.

169 2018-12-26 23:39:54 Any honest reporting of Canada's emissions record would calculate it all the way back to Kyoto. That 2% drop is against a decade of increase and mostly despite Trudeau doing everything in his power short of sending the army to give everything to the oil industry

Whale is an important food source for many 1st nations along the bearing sea. It was Euro cultures who decimated whales populations
188 2018-12-26 23:36:53 This is such an outrage.  The Trump Administration is shrinking National Monuments and opening up land to oil & gas companies to rape it.  We can not stand for this kind of abuse.

197 2018-12-26 23:36:17 Realistically, the result of this hypothetical is massive economic and environmental damage. Power plants, oil refineries, oil wells, chemical plants would lose almost all of their trained staff meaning that any running processes would likely continue unchecked.

207 2018-12-26 23:35:08 Plastics profit the Corporates & Govts support them not us, hence consumers get taxed on use of environmentally unfriendly plastic. 

A substitute could've been used instead of plastic decades ago but oil companies/Govts wouldn't allow it.
208 2018-12-26 23:35:06 What happened to all  O's promises to get out! Doesn't McGurk  know that there  are only losers in that region of the world. Is he the douche bag who kept us in this  losing situation. Give it up we  don't need the oil simpletons.
209 2018-12-26 23:35:03 How you bring your car to the delatership for an oil change and leave with all your service lights on?
210 2018-12-26 23:34:46 Ahh thats completely opposite for our fam. We diversify and always look for ventures. As long as we commit to our main obligations.

213 2018-12-26 23:34:13 Yeah, nah. I have to do it everyday. Too much oil and dust from cardboard and outside turning it into a cess pool otherwise.
214 2018-12-26 23:33:57 Yes and no. What you spend in time and hair product, we spend on maintaining our cuts.   My hair takes <two minutes to style with a hair dryer & a little finishing oil or gel but I'm @ the salon every 4-5 weeks.  If it grows too long it triggers my trich and I pull it out.

223 2018-12-26 23:33:04 Now adays it's more about a pipeline that Saudi Arabia/Israel wants for fossil fuels to Europe but Russia already has a pipeline to Europe. We back Saudi/Israel.

234 2018-12-26 23:31:25 I never said aid “free money” I am saying help them build an economy so there people can stay and earn a decent leaving. Mexico has more oil than the Middle East, but no infrastructure to dill, store and sell
235 2018-12-26 23:31:24 How did oil do today? 
236 2018-12-26 23:31:14 I woke up to dozens of messages in my high school GC, they’re talking about oils. Oil blends for all sorts of ailments. Also love magnet oils, oils for married couples...What is this severe Tita-ness I’m experiencing hahaha
237 2018-12-26 23:31:13 mmm $40 with the oil
238 2018-12-26 23:31:08 But we now have an obligation to them, however don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.
239 2018-12-26 23:31:04 Hi
240 2018-12-26 23:31:04 Besides oil is the most valuable commodities on the world (1.7 Trillion USD) they can afford a war chest while keeping it’s citizen starving, disease ridden & oppressed.
241 2018-12-26 23:31:00 and EVERYTHING MADE OUT OF OIL AND OIL BYPRODUCTS
242 2018-12-26 23:30:56 Coconut oil when I have it, but been using mizani products too recently and they’re amazing. Then rake & pull it thru my hair while it’s wet, then if I have the time help retwist my curls and diffuse, but mostly just put it up to air dry as I’m still trying to grow my hair out
243 2018-12-26 23:30:48 I put hemp oil on my mozzie bites (takes away the itch instantly) and since my dog is mad for hemp oil, I have also been licked to within an inch of my life.

245 2018-12-26 23:30:47 Puede ser que tengas razon; pero el que debe decir " "Ahora" no es el Gobierno es el empresario privado. Por ejemplo : seria muy importante una exportacion masiva de Shale oil; generaria las divisas que nos faltan. Pero entoces ¿ quien es el empresario que afronta el desafio?
246 2018-12-26 23:30:41 It appears that Beto signed the pledge to not take more than $200 from an individual from oil/gas. When it was clear he did, he removed the pledge from his website. People can disagree whether or not that is a big deal, but where was the "falsehoods" in what Sirota wrote?

253 2018-12-26 23:30:11 I suggest CBD oil (cannabis oil). Fully legal, will not get you high as the 'fun' part is taken out, can be obtained in pills and capsules. Capsules taste $%^(ing disgusting though.
254 2018-12-26 23:30:03 If these individual donations are a real issue then they’re a real issue with Bernie too  I absolutely agree money in US politics is a huge prob. But $2500 capped donations ain’t it, and pretending that only some candidates have them from oil employees is hypocritical nonsense
255 2018-12-26 23:30:02 Baby spinach, cod filets, olives, lemon circles, cherry tomatoes, and olive oil all in a baking dish! Cook at 400 :) it’s easy enough that even I don’t frig it up!!! Happy Birthday!!
256 2018-12-26 23:29:37 Basically what I’m saying possession is extremely bullshit. People who are experiencing severe dissociative issues need real help not some snake oil, smack you on the head w/ a Bible, preacher. #LiesOfTheReligious
257 2018-12-26 23:29:11 You can’t be serious!   Norway is in full control of its oil industry, keeps all the proceeds, and is not forced to give much of it away.   

How is that the same as Alberta?

Hammer, give your head a shake !
258 2018-12-26 23:29:10 Omg this goes to show oil workers have no class at all. Motley did good in Alberta and this is how she is treated. Alberta you are disgusting and no class

263 2018-12-26 23:28:05 The 1000s of suffering families crippled by your lack of a damn ... you don’t care?

You don’t seem to understand economics. If AB’s oil industry dies tomorrow, the world won’t use less oil. Other countries (like US, RUS, SA) just create more. You’re supporting those countries.
264 2018-12-26 23:28:03 Bush Sr's practice was to start a war because the target had oil. That was a terrible reason to declare war. Bush Jr's policy was in retaliation for 9/11.

271 2018-12-26 23:27:03 Your own premier campaigned against pipelines FFS. But go ahead blame QC, easier.

No valuable resource in the history of the world has been managed worse than Albertan oil. You can call it deliberate mismanagement or corruption.
272 2018-12-26 23:26:42 A little price gouging like we’ve got here in the oil patch, plus your “special eco-blend” and a little more green tax mixed in I’m sure.  

I just like to think it’s how those rich Hollywood elites like to pay “their fair share”

297 2018-12-26 23:22:00 It's difficult to pass all the rise in feed prices to the shipment price of pork, and livestock farmers seem to be getting stricter.
Also at the edible oil manufacturing factory raw material stocks're exhausted, seems to be insufficient in necessary quantity.

307 2018-12-26 23:20:56 I find the Italian BMT properly tricked up with pickles, hot pepper, lettuce, tomato, mayo, *and* a bit of oil and vinegar eerily satisfying. And je ne regrette nothing afterward.
308 2018-12-26 23:20:49 This rise is based on retail sales figures and oil. Not the index itself. Sales go away in January. Spring heads our way. Do stock gains stay?
309 2018-12-26 23:20:37 круто
310 2018-12-26 23:20:22 Do you think they should downsize too and the US Federal Government, for example, sell all it’s assets to the highest bidder? Who would they sell it too? A Russian Oligarch? An oil tycoon? Jeff Bezos?
311 2018-12-26 23:20:13 These oil pens are a blessing and a curse all wrapped into a cartridge.
312 2018-12-26 23:19:57 They can't just afford to lose the theft of the Iraqi oil and natural resources. This guys are devils and broad day armed rubbers.

318 2018-12-26 23:18:32 It's probably a major oil change. All high performance vehicles charge 1000+ for a major change.
319 2018-12-26 23:18:31 Also someone stole the battery aaaaand the oil light came on despite full oil. But besides that it runs!!!

321 2018-12-26 23:18:17 @JoyAnnReid Joy this is how Russia - now only a second-rate power that has only three  exports (oil, vodka, and caviar) gets back on the world stage. Their ONLY interest is getting rid of those sanctions and Donald is their willing puppet!
322 2018-12-26 23:18:11 Erdogan has everytime supported the IS by buying and transporting the oil of them and give them the weapons and medical care for the is fighters. I'm very interested how Russia react at this point.
323 2018-12-26 23:18:05 The air fryer is so bomb but I can already hear Richard lecturing me about how you need the oil to give fried food its flavor.... Just like turkey burgers.... He hates them the most
324 2018-12-26 23:17:55 Olive oil...
325 2018-12-26 23:17:38 Yup, anything high performance requires at least $1000 oil change. My GLA45 was $1200, and my friend just got quoted $2000 from Audi for his RS3.
326 2018-12-26 23:17:21 That synthetic oil a bitch ain’t it 
327 2018-12-26 23:17:11 Take Sudafed (the one you need to get at the pharmacy), if you have peppermint and eucalyptus oil put a few drops in an Epsom salt and baking soda mix and make a bath soak out of it, and if you have a diffuser diffuse them any kind of tea with peppermint in it should help.

329 2018-12-26 23:16:33 Foil and bottles are handled by machines that require lubrication, so the lubricants have to be certified kosher. E.g. were the bottles that transported the oil kosher? Did the lubricant plant equipment ever process treif fluids?
330 2018-12-26 23:16:23 Dude, that is based on a hanful of plants.  What do you think if we multiplied the number of plants to equal the thousands and thoursands of gas or oil or coal plants?  And if those plants blow they dont wipe out NYC.  So, you can belive what you want but the odds are another

350 2018-12-26 23:12:47 I was just pointing out who the biggest recipient of equalization payments is. For many in the depressed oil patch the irony does not go missing that many of us are unemployed and run deficits to effectively fund QC’s surplus.
351 2018-12-26 23:12:46 Right? let’s take those qualified people who have involved US in countless Wars Beirut Libya  Afghanistan Iraq etc...with all of their false Intel “Blood for oil..” It fucking goes on and on and on. ...And a MSM that’s disguised as journalist Which is “ Hell bent on destroying US
352 2018-12-26 23:12:37 the worst thing any one can ever experience is trying to get a suce out of a bottle but that gross ass oil coming out instead
353 2018-12-26 23:12:28 I like your tweets but must disagree with you on this one. B.O has few if any policies that favour middleclass/poor America. He's not for fair wage; medC4all; he voted for TPP and to further deregulate Wall St which will bring about the next crash and prob Vsoon. Takes oil money.
354 2018-12-26 23:12:27 sucks cause my oil change is up to date and I have no airpods
355 2018-12-26 23:12:27 Talk more about Trump so Canadians forget about Trudeau destroying:

356 2018-12-26 23:12:18 Ah, well, hmm.  Lemon juice and olive oil? Cooked in olive oil and onions with lemon juice squeezed on top? But, remember, has to be baby okra, not the monsters sold here in the US!  but, I agree with you that okra is not a favorite food.
357 2018-12-26 23:12:15 EVs are a terrible idea anyway, everyone should just get bigger engine cars instead which have nice oil changes, petrol and break pads.
358 2018-12-26 23:11:48 Ok, no Googling! Which country is currently the world's largest producer of crude oil?
359 2018-12-26 23:11:27 You lie, read James 5:14.

James 5:14 Is any man sick among you? [Let him bring in the priests of the church], and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.
360 2018-12-26 23:11:24 this is why I'm reverse classist smh why are oil tycoons literally cartoon villians
361 2018-12-26 23:11:21 John Law believed money was only a means of exchange, some call that oil or lubricant of the system, some also call money gold, a store of value. Gold is not, and hopefully never will be, a means of excange, maybe an exchange of value though?
362 2018-12-26 23:11:14 Those books have a good point though oil exporting dictatorship don’t need it’s citizen money to stay exist (that’s why they can afford to keep it’s citizen starving, poor & oppressed so they can’t revolt).
363 2018-12-26 23:10:59 Ain't happening cause that money must be saved for more important things,such as weapons to protect bankers oil companies in foreign lands.Poor American citizens don't deserve health care,they can self medicate with cheap over the counter medications.War mongers are by far better

373 2018-12-26 23:10:00 Read the OpEd article. They are only talking about the size of the UNPROVEN RESERVES as in they have ZERO idea how much might be economically recoverable. And at what price point.

Tight Oil & Gas is impressive but already showing signs of decline curves. Over 50% child wells now

376 2018-12-26 23:09:05 The aim isn’t to enrage them, but to open their eyes to other possibilities. RWNJs often have spouses & children who given the opportunity will react against bigotry. Seeing what  did with its North Sea oil funds can be very enlightening 
377 2018-12-26 23:08:58 There's a difference between invading in self defense, ie to root out terrorists, and invading for oil, which is what created the terrorists in the first place.

380 2018-12-26 23:08:52 Love all of your aiolis!  BUT why do you use canola oil in all of your products?  Do you have any plans to change to a healthy oil instead of using one of the two absolute worst dietary oils available?  Do any of your other products use clean diet ingredients?
381 2018-12-26 23:08:46 I’m pretty sure I gave my dogs a little too much CBD oil treats before we left crestview  they can barely stay awake 
382 2018-12-26 23:08:32 Please explain, oil as cheep as it’s been for 5 years, housing sales down across the country,food prices tha same for the last couple of years, take home pay up very modestly, cars sales down. Why couldn’t he hold off until May or June to make this move.
383 2018-12-26 23:08:19 The fact that he is receiving these donations is a “real” issue. Just like it was a real issue that Hillary took wall street money. The money in politics is most likely THE most important issue. Especially money from oil and gas. Considering the planet is going down the tube.
384 2018-12-26 23:08:14 "Now you're going to get your ass blown up!

388 2018-12-26 23:07:44 You just Tweeted that , "oil and coal are obsolete". 
This is absolutely true if you are now residing on Jupiter.
389 2018-12-26 23:07:34 I told people this was going to happen buy low sell high this seems to happen around holidays. Oil stocks are down now because gas prices are lower. It’s a good time to buy stocks.
390 2018-12-26 23:07:29 Amir Khan promoting beard oil is one of the highlights of my day we just want the Kell Brook fight
391 2018-12-26 23:07:24 Was that the claim? The claim was that he took money from oil company employees and would make favorable votes, which he clearly did. Further, reasonable people cannot differ on this issue. We are headed towards catastrophe. Last, he took a no fossil fuel pledge and broke it.
392 2018-12-26 23:07:23 To feel betrayed by Lord Jesus is the betrayal. To know this is to know the folly of human & apostle alike. Having a need to know relationship between Apostle and Christ means the  acceptance of a frivolous gesture such as an oil foot-rub was an omission of ointment in sacrifice.
393 2018-12-26 23:07:20 That’s lovely, I’m glad to hear that. For that reason, I ask that you re-evaluate our contribution to the environment as a whole. Oil and coal ash spills devastate ecosystems so even if you don’t believe climate change, surely you believe there is an effect to polluting our air
394 2018-12-26 23:07:19 Pardon me for saying this but this proverb is quite problematic in today's India. Reeks of bias against oilmen and oil pressers (Telis)
395 2018-12-26 23:07:18 Oil is a bonus!!
396 2018-12-26 23:07:16 Try coconut oil and eucalyptus. It’s easier on your skin  hope your chest feels better soon

402 2018-12-26 23:06:49 CBD oil! There is a few local places in salt lake that sell it. It’s helped me quite a bit!
403 2018-12-26 23:06:42 Try some oil love. Like a Vitamin E oil. Mine have come off with oil before.  sorry you’re going through that.
404 2018-12-26 23:06:41 Oil has dropped 45% in the last 2 months. To get all that back, it needs to rise  82%. 10% down, 72% to go.
405 2018-12-26 23:06:41 Not to mention rolling back “safe acts” that protect our wildlife and National Parks to oil and mining companies... Enacting laws that keep “brown people” disenfranchised from voting, including American Indians, all while claiming “voter fraud” as their reasoning..
406 2018-12-26 23:06:35 One more thought to ponder.. FYI, oil is the largest component for most commodity ETFs.. I am in $DBC , $MOO, as well as oil sector $XOP, $XLE , $UCO , $AMLP, $FANG, $PBF. IF this market is going to have a sustainable rally it will not happen without commodities ex gold.
407 2018-12-26 23:06:34 So @nigmigo9 will have a fit if I slightly overcook noodles or add a pinch too much seasoning but pretend to not notice that his mom's spaghetti sauce is 3 inches of oil in a pot with a few bits of ground beef 
408 2018-12-26 23:06:26 Im a little confused on why people think the LGBTQ and First Nations communities are not pro oil and gas in Alberta. When its been our main employer. Also, alot of first nation resources have benefit All of Alberta. Just look how rich Alberta and Canada got off Hobbema oil.

414 2018-12-26 23:05:38 The fact that people like Mua have changed tunes and people like @Banafsaa and @ahmed_nihan are off of their current bird cage only suggests that Adeeb is getting more and more powerful! 

In no time, the 1.4billion scandal will be nothing but myth, just like the oil scandal.

422 2018-12-26 23:04:44 Olive oil
423 2018-12-26 23:04:38 Has oil bottomed?
424 2018-12-26 23:04:33 Crude oil
425 2018-12-26 23:04:26 China probably drawn there because their oil imports are rising (~75% imports dependency) so any new source is welcomed.
Russia probably drawn there to as a way to push the Yankee to have a boots on the ground in Venezuela (chevaunchee style).
426 2018-12-26 23:04:20 And oil. Lets not forget, they r determined to keep the world hostage w/fossil fuels, for a hundred years, when its due to be dried up. No oil, no elite triangle of powermongers.
427 2018-12-26 23:03:48 Those people need to be probe and luck up, they are using their influence to change laws against our countries interests, those people are all connected with oil, coal, steel, banks, gold, faith ect. Their interest is with Putin, Turkey, Saudis, EUE, and most of the dictators?
428 2018-12-26 23:03:44 Depends where you are obviously, but some Maserati dealers offer a 36 month service plan for $1500, on the Quattroporte, which includes 3 oil changes, plus all the other service items.

436 2018-12-26 23:03:02 My read on today. Someone put up the oil market which then triggered a short covering rally in stocks. In my experience, it's very dangerous when oil leads because of the day to day volatility in oil prices. Could/should the rally continue? Sure, a few more days is quite possible
437 2018-12-26 23:02:46 It will pass.... a three week down trend and they all were afraid.... already shows that something nasty lurks in the background.... USDJPY, Indices and Oil had a beautiful day... on low volumes
438 2018-12-26 23:02:35 What is circling the bowl is the chance of a democrat win in 2020.  Meanwhile, the economy is booming, record employment, lower taxes, record oil prod/exports, stronger military, better border control etc.  Against  all this the democrats offer open borders and higher taxes.
439 2018-12-26 23:02:34 Nothing is more funny than americans saying " I'm grateful for the military in Afghanistan ect that are helping us live freely " lmao what they're just killing civilians for free oil

460 2018-12-26 22:59:31 What who's doing to them? Venezuelas number one export was oil. They seized it from Mobil, spread the wealth, the business was no longer run by businessmen, but by the state, and they went dead broke because votes don't make you qualified to run an oil company.

464 2018-12-26 22:59:11 Not all of AB’s problems start in Quebec but they exacerbate them, including senate and HoC imbalance, a transfer formula weighted in their favour and the arrogance of many regarding AB oil which is only okay sometimes. Even McLeans noted how corrupt Quebec is.

467 2018-12-26 22:58:51 I am usually a big fan of Wikipedia, but it’s good to be careful. The specific measures section mentions a directed tax on oil/gas profits, not a carbon tax on all use of FF. (Corporate taxes are easy to game. Use taxes for gasoline pumped or cigarettes smoked are hard to dodge.)
468 2018-12-26 22:58:28 Twisting the truth I see.  You’re nothing more than a snake oil salesman.

474 2018-12-26 22:57:49 squeeze out a tube of oil paint for our lovely art history icon 
475 2018-12-26 22:57:37 Ah, so a strong economy is bad because of cost of living. I’m assuming you made that same argument in AB when oil was $150/barrel?

482 2018-12-26 22:56:49 So far as I can tell, the oil export ban was a dumb policy anyway and reasonable people can differ. I'll have to look into the 2nd. One vote seems pretty weak tea for showing he's an oil company devotee.
483 2018-12-26 22:56:38 Génie Oil? Have you received any funds from an oil companies or investment groups?
484 2018-12-26 22:56:30 Kindof agree. But i think breakeven cost still matters in a waybut what breakeven cost for whom? 1) everything else being equal, the cost structure is more variable today than in 2014/15 because tight oil basins are deep into development, 2) cost follows price, always.

487 2018-12-26 22:56:20 the Beto drama is about donations from individuals who work in the oil industry. I just showed you an example of Bernie receiving the same type of donation.
488 2018-12-26 22:56:10 got an oil change, replaced an air filter, and filled up my car with premium for my drive to madison and I got here with 400 miles on a single tank of gas (when I normally get around 300-320)

nice
489 2018-12-26 22:56:05 Life is about joined experiences, learning and passing along knowledge to the next generation.

For instance, oil needs to be at 350° or else youre just gently bathing your wings in warm oil.

553 2018-12-26 22:48:35 Thanks!  I haven't used clove oil since I was a kid, the school nurse always had some, but alas, I don't.  I just needed to take the edge off of it. The vodka and a couple of Naproxen seem to be working nicely.
554 2018-12-26 22:48:34 @DeadBunnyFrank I just saw Vice.  OMG!!!  America is not ready for this movie. Adam McKay hit every single thing right. From the outing of Valerie Plame to taking secret meetings to divide up Iraqi oil fields. Everything. Wanting to blame 9/11 on Iraq. The whole thing.
555 2018-12-26 22:48:30 See this is something I don't understand...WHY TF does Saudi Arabia need nuclear power plants? They running out of oil?
556 2018-12-26 22:48:23 No,... *you* just ran out of fuel oil,...
557 2018-12-26 22:48:23 Its great to hear the big Oil producers are also investing in #Renewables

560 2018-12-26 22:48:04 Oh I tried an oil cleanser for the first time and that shit weirded me out. Very strange. My face felt great though
561 2018-12-26 22:48:03 Gee you should get an audi oil change $ 89.00 and that includes a breakfast, a loner, and a car wash.
562 2018-12-26 22:48:02 Did they manage to find the correct oil filter?
563 2018-12-26 22:47:57 This Christmas me and my family have made the decision to buy @IcelandFoods palm oil free deserts ect and what a great choice they were they are much better tasting than the standard type especially the cheese cake...will be shopping in Iceland shop from now on !!!!!
564 2018-12-26 22:47:26 Ha! It’s just sugar and coconut oil you scrub on your lips to make them soft. Except it’s a jar of damn sugar.  Trying not to eat it 
565 2018-12-26 22:47:24 "Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows." ~Psalms 45:7 #Jesus #God #Bible
566 2018-12-26 22:47:22 Get to pumping that oil Canada. It's long past "Put Saudi out of business" time.
567 2018-12-26 22:46:53 I’ll have to take you word for it. They are getting beaten on sanctions and oil prices so I’m not surprised they are looking to sell...something
568 2018-12-26 22:46:44 The other thing that people are forgetting is EV sales went UP quarterly as the oil price went DOWN. Lots of short term thinkers wouldn’t have considered an EV when purchasing their new vehicle, not yet anyways :)

572 2018-12-26 22:46:32 My aunt had tincture sitting on the bathroom counter along with my many facial oils that I use and I thought it was my argon oil so guess who just batted their face with thc hahahaha
573 2018-12-26 22:46:29 You should check out Carlsbad, New Mexico. It’s on oil and gas boom town right now, with huge traffic problems including fatalities, and increases in violent crime. Workers a living and unsanitary conditions. A complete mess.
574 2018-12-26 22:46:07 Interesting but how much oil is that as % of UK needs then?
575 2018-12-26 22:46:04 "programming is a new math, linux is a new English, and data is a new oil"
576 2018-12-26 22:46:02 PALMARIS LONGUS TENDON is absent in 14% of the population. I have it and the reason I know is, while frying some chicken the other day, I splattered oil on the spot and it hurt like hell.
577 2018-12-26 22:45:49 They say there is a first time for everything. Well today was the first time a customer tried to put cannabis oil in my coffee.
578 2018-12-26 22:45:38 Spice up your sex life with a massage oil!

580 2018-12-26 22:45:23 I wish! In the plane, I have real instruments to tell me what's going on...oil temp and pressure, fuel pressure, cylinder head and exhaust manifold temp, battery voltage and charge current. In the car, you have to have a laptop with special software and data cables for diags!
581 2018-12-26 22:45:04 My ex left his beard oil at my house and I ran out of my hair stuff... now I fully recommend this product my hair is silky smooth n soft 
582 2018-12-26 22:44:55 Bears dandruff has gone, I have been bathing him in wheatgerm and lime juice and massaging coconut oil into his skin and giving him a daily brushing and lots of nourishing foods. He’s quite at home here with all his new doggy friends.
583 2018-12-26 22:44:32 I’m honestly not a big essential oil freak but I use an essential oil pain cream from Young Living and I’ve found it is the only thing that helps me sleep at night for my hip pain. I think it’s mostly wintergreen.
584 2018-12-26 22:44:31 No offense, but you forgot a BIG one, Oil & gas workers, you'd be hard pressed to find somebody in O&G in Texas or North Dakota that doesn't love our President !
585 2018-12-26 22:44:28 Putin has issues with oil down here among many others - hasn’t Gold disappointed even gold bugs in all the chaos of past month
586 2018-12-26 22:44:25 Aside from his ties to the gas and oil business, who pays Santorum to say these silly things?
587 2018-12-26 22:44:15 Today’s upswing was mostly due to energy stocks which rebounded as crude oil went up. So...higher gas prices will be a drag on the economy.
588 2018-12-26 22:44:09 10% rally in the price of oil in NY!
589 2018-12-26 22:44:08 And big egg
590 2018-12-26 22:44:06 this dumbass bitch wouldn’t start but the guy that towed it said it started and a lot of oil was leaking so it’s en route to the dealership to get fixed :(
591 2018-12-26 22:44:01 Olive oil is just pan loTion
592 2018-12-26 22:44:00 To clean paint off your hands, use olive oil - it softens the paint and makes it easy to remove.
593 2018-12-26 22:43:59 I want to thank the Viagra and CBD oil bots for attacking the website on Christmas Day. You always keep me on my toes!
594 2018-12-26 22:43:58 Hoja sio umiliki, it is impact of the airlines to the nation(this is true to the Arabs &Rwanda) and it's future growth(every other nation).

Arabs can supplement the losses with oil revenue, Rwanda is landlocked and it wants to be a hub for central Africa - makes sense.
595 2018-12-26 22:43:51 For those who’ve asked:
Eggnog Pound Cake

1 pkg. yellow cake mix
1 pkg. instant vanilla pudding
3/4 cup eggnog
3/4 cup vegetable oil
4 large eggs
1/2 tsp. nutmeg
powdered sugar

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Combine cake mix, pudding, eggnog and oil in a large mixing bowl.
596 2018-12-26 22:43:41 Just #hope basically.   Hope for lower taxes, to get oil moving, to balance the budget, to make illegal crossing actually illegal, to ensure criminals serve time in prison not healing lodges, to stop giving #tax $$ to terrorists and to cut off funding for state media
597 2018-12-26 22:43:37 But your hands don’t exfoliate properly, leaving behind oil, dirt, dead skin, etc. You’re right tho they can carry germs and bacteria when left to dry.
598 2018-12-26 22:43:25 I’m getting an oil change and he’s asking me shit about my car and I feel so dumb

601 2018-12-26 22:43:05 that will lock the fossil industry into Canada for the next 50+  years...  
The largest Oil sands mining site EVER is being made right now, and is expected to exceed Alberta's 100Mt emission cap.

604 2018-12-26 22:42:47 sorry this has happened to you dove...hopefully the epsom salts and oil will cure the pinched nerves....feel better
605 2018-12-26 22:42:39 Spain aside, you are incorrect about renewables killing more birds. Carbon increase coupled with pollution kills far more, as do oil spills, scrape mining etc. You are generalising far too much. Nuclear is far too expensive and we have no clue how to deal with the waste.
606 2018-12-26 22:42:29 Or your WORSHIPING money NOT God Hmmmm lets get some of that oil money, or that "poppy field" money. Will kill our own doing it, and kill our own selling it to them too. Yeah we get richer, they get poorer, we kill them off and save the planet for our own families growth. SICK
607 2018-12-26 22:42:28 Market forces played a role, but the denial of "not a drop" of Saudi oil was a lie in that Irving oil operates 173 stations in QC & gets over a third of their oil from SA.

Alberta's problems were not made in QC. The Feds & their own Provincial leaders shoulder most of the blame.
608 2018-12-26 22:42:12 Could every skincare brand under the sun STOP using jojoba, Argan, and avocado, and Marula oil please and thank you? It’s ruining my skin 
609 2018-12-26 22:42:11 CBD, comes in oil or capsules. There is such a low about of THC that it is inert. CBD controls pain better than opioids and no narco effects
610 2018-12-26 22:42:03 You are forgetting motor oil
611 2018-12-26 22:41:52 Try sage essential oil for the pain but only on zero alcohol. I'm also beginning to think dairy milk can aggravate the pain. Just a hunch.
612 2018-12-26 22:41:46 Bears dandruff has cleared due to a good diet and everyone’s advice the lime juice, wheatgerm shampoo, coconut oil and massage and grooming. He’s a happy boy.
613 2018-12-26 22:41:26 Ok united fans we need to get behind spurs if we can’t win it. As if we want the council houses or the oil money winning the league
614 2018-12-26 22:41:22 I can also take the post down if I dint make it well, and probably post another after I am taught. Cz these replies are kinda a dent on my cooking career. 
Funny thing, I guess it should be the whole picture and all cz the oil wasn't as plenty as stated. But It is all good.
615 2018-12-26 22:41:14 Certainly old school bear trap rip the face off rally - looked like algos were ripped anew after predatory HFT got caught below - even more so on Oil where it’s overwhelming bear driven
616 2018-12-26 22:41:08 Maybe CNN should get an economist to explain the dynamics of the market, China trade (not really about trade), oil prices, interest rates, etc or just watch real economists on CNBC explain the dynamics and then see thru the distorted facts from CNN
617 2018-12-26 22:41:07 @dunkiniced 
Eggnog Pound Cake

1 pkg. yellow cake mix

618 2018-12-26 22:40:49 “Betting that science is wrong and oil companies are right is the dumbest experiment in history by far”
619 2018-12-26 22:40:46 Wow, your ignorance of the oilfield is beyond all belief. Find out what your talking about from an informed source before you spout off about what “big oil” owns.
620 2018-12-26 22:40:40 Yea covered in oil in the pan for forty mins be lovely
621 2018-12-26 22:40:39 So, a lot of the oil and gas from Alberta ends up in USA for them to refine/use/export..

Our problem isn't that we must stop the Oilsands mining, it's that new mining sites are being developed right now..
622 2018-12-26 22:40:27 The claim that it's misleading is that the number he cited refers to people employed in oil and gas, not oil and gas companies. No oil/gas companies donated to Beto at all, but people who worked for them (who could be janitors, or CEOs) did. I find this argument...mixed.
623 2018-12-26 22:40:27 今日もガチャはドブでした 泣くぞ

626 2018-12-26 22:40:18 My grandfather was a socialist & organizer w/the oil, chemical &  atomic workers union. Regan worked hard to bust the union for trying to form the first US labor party. Prior, he & his brother saved the family dairy farm by running guns & moonshine during the Depression.

634 2018-12-26 22:39:45 otex olive oil
635 2018-12-26 22:39:38 I mostly agree, but It wasn't always about pilfering resources. We never took Iraqi oil, except maybe for use by the military on hand.
It was usually about control of currency used, US $'s as petro $. Or it was about political beliefs, like trying to install Muslim Brotherhood.

640 2018-12-26 22:38:46 How can u take money from gas and oil special interest & call yourself a progressive that is trying to get rid of gas and oil so we can save our planet? Fossil fuels need to stay in the ground and politicians need to turn their backs on all fossil fuel companies and the Saudi’s.
641 2018-12-26 22:38:46 Well they can all be replaced for £200 million each with that oil money 
642 2018-12-26 22:38:45 Hit me up after the game. I got like 345 free oil change coupons from the great folks @QuickLane. I won't need to pay for an oil change until 2053. Can barely get my billfold shut. #RTB
643 2018-12-26 22:38:45 They are from Texas. The number one oil and gas producer in the country.  What did you expect.

659 2018-12-26 22:36:40 So, we closed on this weekend getaway place precisely four weeks ago. Arrived this afternoon to discover the (oil) heat is dead. Circulation motor is shot.
660 2018-12-26 22:36:35 Granted this is a new kind that has argali oil, coconut oil and collagen. 
661 2018-12-26 22:36:15 It did indeed. Why? Low end retailers had a great XMas and oil companies rebounded. So Dollar General is doing great and your gas price is going up.
662 2018-12-26 22:36:11 Monarchies work for the Arab world for the sake of stability because it is cultural. What destabilizes them is when people like us come in and tell them to be just like us, while we take their oil and natural resources in the process.

667 2018-12-26 22:35:28 The capitalists rob the planet, rip it open for oil and gold, and leave us with nothing but labor.
668 2018-12-26 22:35:26 SILENCE! The narrative has spoken. Beto drinks oil for breakfast. He farts into a natural gas pipeline. And he skateboarded in a video once so he has zero ideas.
669 2018-12-26 22:35:24 @realDonaldTrump the prophet @prophetahuva says that you are not going to get Iran's oil and gold. She says deal with your economy without involving everyone and the world does not rotate around America and it's desires. There's more to the world than America.

674 2018-12-26 22:34:45 Yeah we know... Whatever gets sanctioned, ends up getting sold on the black market.. Like Iranian oil being bought by Israel (in the black). These games are as old as dirty politics... And make no sense, whatsoever, depending upon which side you're on

693 2018-12-26 22:32:40 So I know the @amazon working conditions aren't great and thoroughly advocate / support better conditions with higher pay, but orange flower oil is not replaceable with extra virgin olive oil. Ever.
694 2018-12-26 22:32:25 WOW !! Trump will claim he caused the 1,000 Dow rally.  But outraged oil went up that much.

Road trip ready

696 2018-12-26 22:32:17 I’m at that age somewhere between “I can stand downtown for 12 hours at an NBA Championship Parade” and “if I sit on the couch for twenty minutes I need an oil can to loosen the joints before I can stand up.”

699 2018-12-26 22:32:08 Apparently you have to check the oil in your car so it doesn’t run out ??? who knew. Wow being an adult sucks

701 2018-12-26 22:32:02 I got 3 essential oil diffusers I’m about to diffuse the fuck out of EVERY damn room in this house.
702 2018-12-26 22:31:53 I can change the oil, oil filter, and anti-freeze, and change a flat.. That's about it.
703 2018-12-26 22:31:53 Do u use some sort of vegetable oil
704 2018-12-26 22:31:53 Gophers lead! 3-0 in first quarter of Quick Lane Bowl. I know. Nothing’s more exciting than a football game named after a Ford oil change facility.

715 2018-12-26 22:30:25 have any of yall tried CBD oil? does it work?
716 2018-12-26 22:30:19 Do not think that love, in order to be genuine, has to be extraordinary. . . . How does a lamp burn? Through the continuous input of small drops of oil. . . . What are these drops of oil in our lamps? They are the small things of daily life - Mother Theresa
717 2018-12-26 22:30:12 I’ve had blackstone analyze the oil on my MINI at regular intervals since new and 10k oci is really not bad. Happy to send the reports if you ever want data for a story. (I have changed trans and diff oil because it’s $30 and an hour against a multi-k bill if either fails.)

722 2018-12-26 22:29:59 We don't know unless we try.  Alaska has had a basic income from oil revenues for decades.
723 2018-12-26 22:29:46 You seem to not know what senators are suppose to do to win or congressmen lol. Wait won't you twist yourself to pretzel defending beto taking oil money cause he's from texas? Yeah Bernie is from a white state so he has white staff? It's the same thing chudyok.

727 2018-12-26 22:29:04 The people that changed my oil didn’t do it correctly as in didn’t put the oil filter on all the way and my engine is fucked now and they won’t help in anyway what so ever
728 2018-12-26 22:28:58 ...

I'm not saying anything. I'd rather not have @iRaffer lock me in an oil drum and kick me down a hill into a river.

739 2018-12-26 22:27:35 If you are failing and I heard you are failing, sure.
I mean, you can only sell so much snake oil and still pay for cool eagle logos for your show
740 2018-12-26 22:27:32 I got my oil changed today and I didn’t know it costs TWENTY DOLLARS to get my brakes LOOKED at (I didn’t even get them changed) and now I’m sad.
741 2018-12-26 22:27:30 Oil feild jobs create alcoholics. I am living drinking proof of it
742 2018-12-26 22:27:29 @realDonaldTrump the prophet @prophetahuva has seen you try to get Israel to fight Iran on your behalf because you want the oil in Iran so bad. @prophetahuva and her God will not allow

744 2018-12-26 22:27:05 Made an appointment with @pepboysauto for 12pm for an oil change, here I am 3 hours after check in and they haven’t even moved my truck from where i parked it.

748 2018-12-26 22:26:11 Well, over here we've learned that water and oil don't mix. For those of us trying to promote #BlackUnity and building for OURSELVES, you can keep that we need to work with the white man shit wherever you are and see how it works for you.
749 2018-12-26 22:26:05 Factually, we only have accounting on 32 Million of his 69M, so all the facts are not in.  While, only 1.5% so far can be attribute to Oil&Gas either personal or corporate...it may be higher once/if the full campaign reporting is complete.

752 2018-12-26 22:26:00 Sorry! That is crummy. Try some aromatherapy oils on the back of your neck-Peppermint & Lavender in a carrier oil like Sweet Almond or Sweet Orange. Wash your hands & avoid your eyes. #ThisGrammaKnowsHerNaturalRemedies #CallMeACrone #SixtyThreeAndOkayWithTitle

755 2018-12-26 22:25:48 Wow...
756 2018-12-26 22:25:21 CBD oil tastes bad but it shouldn't make you throw up, I would contact the brand just in case. It should taste like grass, tea and a little like dirt but not enough to make you feel sick.  Be careful!
757 2018-12-26 22:25:21 I read this as we are soon to go on vacay and a new housesitter is employed. Previous experiences have included... dead chickens, dead pet rabbits replaced with two random new rabbits, power outages and the inappropriate use of expensive oil paints and brushes. Holidays are fun.
758 2018-12-26 22:25:19 Then stop burning fossil fuels. Australia has huge renewable resources but is still addicted to coal and oil. Climate change will devastate Aus potentially
759 2018-12-26 22:25:10 Were facts relevant when you declared it a low blow to discuss large donations from oil execs? Or are they only relevant when it serves your interests?

Also, didn't you name a sexual harassment victim in front of your entire staff?
760 2018-12-26 22:25:08 That’s a bunch of pictures of the Escondida COPPER mine, not lithium. The other pics are of oil sands.

764 2018-12-26 22:24:53 Same old same old in an election year. Make promises to the most populated areas to win the election.The premier in Quebec would rather get oil from countries who supply money to terrorists.Take away his share of transfer moneyHow can 1/3 of the population be a have not province.
765 2018-12-26 22:24:38 Stay hydrated. Keep junk food to a minimum. Always moisturize after showering or washing your face, dry skin promotes oil production. Avoid touching your face with your hands throughout the day, your hands are dirty and you’ll put all that gunk in your pores.
766 2018-12-26 22:24:35 A) he’s not going to come even close to winning & B) saying he’s going to take oil and Wall Street money to pay for his programs is a generalization, a cliche’ & cop out because he has no details.
767 2018-12-26 22:24:26 Girl..... you best be making use of that coconut oil lol
768 2018-12-26 22:24:24 If the oil companies decide to stop selling gas and refining oil, watch how quickly electric cars are adopted.

The question is, though, will oil companies stop selling gas to protest? Or will they still see profits and still sell gas?
769 2018-12-26 22:24:03 Lmfaoooo aye she don’t even cook the fries. She just pre heats the oil for 8 hours 
770 2018-12-26 22:23:58 If you have shake, I can make butter/oil and bake one.

772 2018-12-26 22:23:42 what's your take on oil ? low liquidity this days and when it comeback again, reality sets again
773 2018-12-26 22:23:37 no te olvides de la Standar Oil
774 2018-12-26 22:23:33 "Dead dinosaurs" sounds much more metal than "Oil". Maybe we should actually use that.
775 2018-12-26 22:23:30 You are playing yourself Ross.

Most Maserati dealers charge $250 for an oil change.

I call BS on you paying $1,500 for an oil change.
776 2018-12-26 22:23:15 @ErinBurnett tell me I am not crazy to doubt this market... record drop.. record gain.. government shutdown oil up 10%.  There is no correlation to business performance or environment anymore... purely reaction without data
777 2018-12-26 22:23:00 Except, because he took large donations from oil execs, turns out it wasn't at all disingenuous. However, your points, including liking Bernie supporters to fascists, is disingenuous AF.
778 2018-12-26 22:22:56 [putting bong water into my aunts essential oil mister]
779 2018-12-26 22:22:55 My homemade is melted down beeswax/coconut oil/essential oils. U can make it stiffer or softer based on the ratio of beeswax to coconut oil. It usually works pretty well and is less flakey than Crew, but was getting tired of beeswax always in my hair since it's not water soluble.
780 2018-12-26 22:22:41 Though it did turn out that Beto had taken large individual donations from oil/gas execs, violating a pledge he made. I think that’s good pressure to put on all politicians.
781 2018-12-26 22:22:28 no one pushes the game as hard as competitive players. some people base their livelihoods on this. do you wanna watch soccer, but sometimes they spill oil on the field and the soccer ball is a random shape and you don’t know the shape it is before you play? that’s items in smash.
782 2018-12-26 22:22:26 Uh.........

Dude, have you read my reviews? I boil the games I love in oil.
783 2018-12-26 22:22:23 i decided to use oil instead of lotion on my legs today. guess who’s lost grip on just about everything she’s touched in the last 5 minutes.
784 2018-12-26 22:22:21 Chronic inaction by British and European governments against the pursuit of profit by oil companies and car manufacturers.

794 2018-12-26 22:21:26 I was totally ready. Everything in the movie is historically factual. Republicans just can’t handle the TRUTH.  From Valerie Plame’s name being scorched to blaming 9/11 on Iraq. To the rise of ISIS due to the destruction of Iraq for Cheney’s buddies to take the oil fields. 
795 2018-12-26 22:21:00 The larger wolfcamp natural gas/oil field made the news in West Texas.
796 2018-12-26 22:20:55 The story of santa Claus also has to do with the biological Claustrum and the secretion of the sacred Christos annointing oil within the human body

1. Grab desired # of potatoes. Wash thoroughly. 
2. STAB the potatoes with a knife or fork. Let your bottled up rage out. 
3. Put potatoes on lined baking sheet. Drizzle w/ generous amount of olive oil. Bake for 1 hour 35 min at 350 F.

fast fashion is one of the largest contributers to plastic pollution and greenhouse gas emissions making it 2nd place to OIL! STOP GIVING THEM YOUR FUCKING MONEY PERIODT!!
803 2018-12-26 22:19:51 There is a good reason for the feds to manage the land for all the people. You would prefer a giant oil refinery in that spot? The majority of money paid for entry into Western National Parks goes into the general fund. A small amount goes back into the parks.

807 2018-12-26 22:19:20 @lazaroumterror Surely Trump's visit to Iraq is about oil?
It's always about oil.

810 2018-12-26 22:19:07 IKNORITE?

I wound up using Dawn dish soap. That stuff cleans environmental disaster oil spills off penguins & sea birds. I figured it would remove dog nose smears.

It worked.
811 2018-12-26 22:19:06 One or two coffees for breakfast, preferred meat over fish, which she doused in olive oil. Ate a pound of chocolate per week.

818 2018-12-26 22:18:16 Disney “trademarked” the  Swahili phrase “Hakuna Matata“ which means “in this place..no problems”. How do you trademark someone else’s language? You take the farmland, diamonds, uranium, gold, cobalt, copper, iron, oil, ivory tusks, religion, math, medical knowledge...as well?
819 2018-12-26 22:18:02 Roasted with olive oil and garlic, then baked with heavy cream, parmesan, and panko crumbs. You won't even know they're brussel sprouts. And no calories either lol
820 2018-12-26 22:17:59 You are correct!  Furthermore, Trump said we should invade/occupy and take control of the oil wells - in the heart of the Middle East !  Some folks have convenient memory loss.
821 2018-12-26 22:17:55 Didn’t screw my oil filter in all the way, 10 liters of oil all over the place  @LiquiMolyUSA
822 2018-12-26 22:17:47 Really simple: cut in half, dress in olive oil, salt and pepper then in with the meat for 35 minutes. You have to wait until the edges go very brown and almost burnt.
823 2018-12-26 22:17:38 Yo henny is legit motor oil mixed with salt and regret fuck outta here
824 2018-12-26 22:17:33 It is amazing and scary that Trump is the main fundamentals of oil. If he says sell, the oil falls, if he thinks today is a great buying opportunity... oil goes up by 10%. Wonder what's next 
825 2018-12-26 22:17:32 Cat litter is the solution to oil and antifreeze spills, so it makes sense.

828 2018-12-26 22:17:17 This oil is not getting me blasted at all 
829 2018-12-26 22:17:13 It's a taboo to make budget using the upper limit of any projection. It's always best to use the worse case scenario. The present budget is based on an overly optimistic projection for the oil price in 2019. Today, there is a gloat in supply and that wont change in 2019.

837 2018-12-26 22:15:50 Bernie's plans are well thought out, he just doesn't have oil and Wall street money to spoon feed you how it works on CNN.

970 2018-12-26 21:59:45 5. Shampoo twice, but only condition once.
6. Comb your hair in the shower before rinsing out your conditioner.
7. Pat dry your hair with a towel- Rubbing it breaks your hair.
8. Use coconut or argan oil while your hair is still damp to avoid splits
971 2018-12-26 21:59:41 Even though today's move in the S&P can be short lived due to a lack of volume i think we are approaching the bottom. It is not just the S&P, just look at oil. I am sticking to my view for the first few months of 2019 of higher equity prices, particularly in EM, and a lower USD.
972 2018-12-26 21:59:35 Do it lauren! Aquatic violence speak to me like truffle oil
973 2018-12-26 21:59:26 It's like you pick what to reply. 
1984 - I mentioned Human Rights Abuses, 
Decrees 2 and 4.
We had the worst depression since 1970. 
Oil for food trade with Brazil.
1983- I said his coup was bad omen. 
Except for reprinting the Naira we are witnessing 1984
Challenge me on these.

975 2018-12-26 21:58:53 Asked a similar question about why Oil Country couldn’t bring Bieksa in on a PTO or something earlier? Sounds like he’s been holding out on making a commitment, hoping for work “close to home” (California). Time is ticking on that possibility at this point.
976 2018-12-26 21:58:47 Cmon i need a oil change
@PEPBOYSAUTO #GIFTCARD #WIN
977 2018-12-26 21:58:37 The reason the US wants to help the kurds is because Assad refuses to ally with America and build that pipe line and give oil. But if they give the land to the kurds, they will allow America to do so.
978 2018-12-26 21:58:31 Oil dey your head!
979 2018-12-26 21:58:28  she's def lacking oil in the head
980 2018-12-26 21:58:16 Oh yes I forgot, because the Tories are not a bunch of lying, robbing snake oil spivs are they!!
981 2018-12-26 21:58:03 I know right?  Huge break for the renewable energy companies not owned by oil.  Happy day!
982 2018-12-26 21:57:18 Hahah they saw the painting I posted a while back on ig. It's oil.
983 2018-12-26 21:57:04 I put baby oil on my whole body before I get in bed
984 2018-12-26 21:56:58 Anointing oil
985 2018-12-26 21:56:46 How can anyone who removes protections from our water, air, land and food sources have the best interests of the American people in mind. Trump is a puppet president for big oil and coal companies. I am not a liberal, conservative, Democrat or Republican, just American...
986 2018-12-26 21:56:45 I'd like to be the one applying oil on him... I have no hidden intentions of course haha
987 2018-12-26 21:56:37 Hear hear please tell me oil went up too
988 2018-12-26 21:56:35 S&P 500 rallies hard from extremely oversold conditions $SPY

Crude Oil prices rebound; energy stocks outperform $USO

Retail stocks outperform after strong Holiday sales
989 2018-12-26 21:56:26 The best part is when oil crashes and then they're upside down on their truck and their child support
990 2018-12-26 21:56:24 Only killjoy, loudmouth, interrupter, know nothing, and all around pathetic excuse for a financial news employee Sara Eisen can throw shadow on the Dow's all-time biggest gaining day.  Sad that CNBC employees her.  She is no @MariaBartiromo Replace her !!  @cnbc Steve Burke
991 2018-12-26 21:56:23 finland is real, as it is a former swedish territory. norway, however, is a fictitious place used in an attempt by the united states to tap arctic oil
992 2018-12-26 21:56:07 If you have black hair u better use the wet look to your full advantage. Any gel/oil I put in hair makes it look like ramen noodles now lol :( the price I pay
993 2018-12-26 21:56:02 VERY BAD indeed...they are precious creatures of our oceans and have survived centuries doing what they do. To be hunted down for oil and blubber is cruel and unnecessary. We suck as keepers of this planet.
994 2018-12-26 21:55:56 Each oil will tell you what it’s good for etc 
995 2018-12-26 21:55:51 The 2019 oil and gas outlook is quite optimistic for all oil and gas producing states

So my point is that F.O. divested because of THAT +ve outlook

We can however agree that the state of our economy should not be dependent on “oil prices” and we need to “diversify” 2/2
996 2018-12-26 21:55:45 My motor oil looks like chocolate milk
997 2018-12-26 21:55:34 Lol who is funding all these climate scientists who all agree? Seems more likely that the richest people in the world - big oil - pays politicians to try keep them from going under to renewables
998 2018-12-26 21:55:25 1) I have health care (2) AR15s R inanimate objects, they can’t do anything without human operation. (3) I don’t have social security. (4) the stock market having highs & lows is normal. (5) America has the largest oil supply in the world. The sky is not falling. Support#45
999 2018-12-26 21:55:20 Does coconut oil help with keeping hair from getting knots?  Ever since I grew my beard out longer it keeps happening. I can comb it out for 10 mins straight it will still tangle up
1000 2018-12-26 21:55:10 Forget Jewish money. @KingJames has that oil money
1001 2018-12-26 21:55:08 Oh brother. The reverence of the highest office in the land sinks further and further below that reserved for ambulance chasers and snake oil salesmen.
1002 2018-12-26 21:55:07 Love the Tesla range, well played!  Question:  Have any studies been done comparing the eco cost of building electric cars (with their batteries and lifetime charging) vs. internal combustion vehicles (and its lifetime fuel and oil search costs factored in)?
1003 2018-12-26 21:54:56 My cousin just payed $85 for an oil change on her 97 Honda 
1004 2018-12-26 21:54:50 If you want oil we have, if you want knights we have, if you want friendship we have.
Please protect Kurdistan from the enemy
1005 2018-12-26 21:54:44 The funny thing about oil is there's a massive global cartel that keeps overproduction from rendering it completely worthless and bankrupting every producer.
1006 2018-12-26 21:54:36 [Smiles and gets a pot started on the stove, adding a bit of oil] Do you want regular butter or truffle oil or parm and pepper?
1007 2018-12-26 21:54:32 Lol yes, native stew with red oil. Very good, would recommend
1008 2018-12-26 21:54:21 I'm so tired of seeing that 100 companies thing referenced i almost want to make a video explaining how they're all oil companies, they're including scope 3 emissions, they include state owned emission sources etc etc
1009 2018-12-26 21:53:54 The FUNNIEST thing is I give out SOOOOOOO much beard advice that when I was telling @YAWmusic about @unclejimmyband Nay & Tee ended up doing the presentation for me about the beard oil & beard balm & how to use it lmao! 
1010 2018-12-26 21:53:53 I’m was so triggered watching her I had to run out and buy some hair conditioner and hot oil treatments.
1011 2018-12-26 21:53:47 I need a full body rub down  oil and everything
1012 2018-12-26 21:53:37 （多分）今年最後の長距離出張。なごやーー
1013 2018-12-26 21:53:33 It depends on if those issues are deal breakers, such as Beto being backed by big oil. If you are owned by corporate interests, it should be a deal breaker.
1014 2018-12-26 21:53:30 If free speech means big oil representatives in the Green New Deal committee, then yes.
1015 2018-12-26 21:53:25 I disconnected the battery and reconnected it and everything was fine again but I will bring this up when I take it in for its next oil change. Thank you!
1016 2018-12-26 21:53:20 I read some Liberals here say the protests in AB/SK are about 'nothing'.

They can't see those oil & gas workers are tired of being spat on by the Trudeaus, Butts and McKennas, who owe their lavish lifestyles to the efforts of those very same oil & gas workers.
1017 2018-12-26 21:53:19 Correction sir...he is politically irrelevant.
1018 2018-12-26 21:53:16 > dicing up a tomato. 

“The rest...the rest you have to let be, watch, and build the next day from.” 
Finding a bowl in the cabinet he added the tomato and the small amount of garlic he ‘d chopped to add the slightest amount of olive oil and then salt and a hint of pepper.

1021 2018-12-26 21:52:57 When the bar is low, you exceed it and you're showered in anointing oil

What I've observed is, those doing the anointing, like to be right

So, until further notice, Baker is a made man.....untouchable
1022 2018-12-26 21:52:56 Can't wait for the inevitable tweetstorm upon his return. But does this mean we'll be "taking the oil" like he's always said we should have done?
1023 2018-12-26 21:52:38 I hate getting my oil changed.
1024 2018-12-26 21:52:38 #dodgers   If Ol Andy lets the Padres waltz into the Kluber talks and snatch him away from LA, he should be boiled in oil..
1025 2018-12-26 21:52:17 @PeterHoskinsTV market appears to be following crude oil
1026 2018-12-26 21:52:11 Bowl or to get my oil changed? 
1027 2018-12-26 21:52:07 Segun, divesting was the term I intended to use (no thanks to autocorrect). 

However, that doesn’t change the topic which is Mr. Otedola’s plans and it’s relation to the oil and gas outlook in 2019.  1/2
1028 2018-12-26 21:52:02 Well, that is wrong. Look at the correlation between oil prices and stock prices. If oil prices drop due to a positive supply shock  we should expect stock prices to go up. Now check the correlation in the past decade - strongly positive. Hence, it is nearly all nominal demand.
1029 2018-12-26 21:51:45 Devil's Bean, just use palm oil. Sorry

1032 2018-12-26 21:51:06 Title is misleading - it says Ottawa’s debt-to-GDP ratio is lowest of G7 & falling & won't affect grans that much. Climate change is important to them but Cons opposing C tax. 

When oil $ dropped Norway, invested oil revenues. Alberta Fund is worth $17.6B. Norway - $1.3T.
1033 2018-12-26 21:51:03 I love ya Antonio but this had to happen. End of year sell off over. Trump also promised us health care. Boom. Went the wrong way, as has deficit, as has  relationship with allies. I do believe Putin controls him. ISIS is not destroyed, Oil & Coal are obsolete, unless your Russia

1036 2018-12-26 21:50:49 The problem with bitcoin is now, and always will be, anonymity.  It allows objectively bad people to launder money.  The nonsense that seeing transactions will prevent laundering is either incredible naïveté or snake oil.  The banking system exists for a reason.
1037 2018-12-26 21:50:46 In a way. Russia has an interest, Russia is going to make money off of the oil. The American people are sick of occupying the Middle East, so everyone gets what they want.

1040 2018-12-26 21:50:29 I realized you were talking about a cat before I could commit to a possibility & research a solution... Maybe leaning towards burning oil & affecting emissions.
1041 2018-12-26 21:50:26 Hi Theresa! So thrilled to hear you're loving this new addition to our regular collection. How does the oat milk and lavender oil leave your skin feeling?
1042 2018-12-26 21:50:06 That, and/or some Saudia Arabian oil shithead, just like the rest of the "news" outlets we're stuck with.
1043 2018-12-26 21:50:05 Is Sam concerned with the thickness of oil running through the political parties? It’s a strange analogy...
1044 2018-12-26 21:49:56 Maybe if it was infused olive oil. I can't imagine a household without olive oil, peanut oil, or canola. Hope its not Italian. They don't sort out the nasty olives to save on their poor economy
1045 2018-12-26 21:49:44 Me being me went and put my face above a frying pan which had hot oil (solely to smell), oil spurted out because it was too hot and splatted on my face, burnt myself on my upper lip, tiny but still, welppppp

1062 2018-12-26 21:47:57 Y'all better stop borrowing people cars, I know that. Soon as that #Motor start clacking,burning oil, and that transmission stop going in reverse they gone say you  broke that ragedy sucker ...

1064 2018-12-26 21:47:49 Haha they’re probably FOMOing or bought later in the day.  What’s your upside $SPX target for this run?  So glad to finally see some life in oil, I’m eager to see how this plays out and if this liquidation sets the stage for the road to $84 (or was your target $86?)
1065 2018-12-26 21:47:41 In a bit. Changing the oil in my car. That’s how bored I am
1066 2018-12-26 21:47:30 That says nothing about the Heartland Institute. You're just smearing Heartland because their defense of the free market currently aligns with the production of oil. It won't always.
1067 2018-12-26 21:47:25 I think that's true in the desert areas, Like parts of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, and California. But with all the oil "mishaps?" It's Nemo's Revenge.

1072 2018-12-26 21:46:50 Oil dey your head babe!!

1079 2018-12-26 21:46:14 That you just defended your first silly tweet, by posting another equally ignorant one?
You won't understand, because you obviously don't read much, but oil is just One stock option, although, from that stock, comes others options, but again, One.
1080 2018-12-26 21:46:00 is it #Trune that average length of frack well production is 18mo? MONTHS. Like 1.5 years. e.g. Less Than 2 years? TY and TY for landowners contracted to fracked oil.
1081 2018-12-26 21:45:50 Oil had its purpose, time to move on to solar powered other clean energy.
Long overdue!
1082 2018-12-26 21:45:35 What moves oil prices?? Mostly expectations for future global nominal demand - global monetary conditions.
1083 2018-12-26 21:45:26 We are now consuming less gas and oil in America then we are using that has not happened in my lifetime
1084 2018-12-26 21:45:16 Well Venezuelans which create OPEC is the one which was saying that oil is a devil excrement.
1085 2018-12-26 21:45:11 Oh man you gotta check out the abq olive oil company. Such a cool place
1086 2018-12-26 21:45:00 Oil.. Why is the ground slippery.. I don't slip & slide.. I walk like a boss into it..  
1087 2018-12-26 21:44:52 I doubt Nigeria would exit the Crude oil curse if crude oil does not get to bottom low. (5 dollars per barrel) Perhaps then we would be forced to think.
1088 2018-12-26 21:44:49 I believe they are looking to take oil producing properties, not searching to retake ISIS ground. BTW, you can thank "W" and Cheney for ISIS

1094 2018-12-26 21:43:57 it doesn't lol, the issues facing Venezuela are completely different to the issues facing other failed 'socialist' states. Venezuela's issues are complex and largely stem from near-total dependency on the oil industry and extensive currency mismanagement leading to hyperinflation

1097 2018-12-26 21:43:39 So, from closing at $49-50.7 to trading at around $55 per bbl. $Brent is fluctuating. Ladies and gentlemen, we are living the volatility created by an influx of short cycle oil supply that is prone to short term speculation. Oil market needs stability for the sake of all. #OOTT

1106 2018-12-26 21:42:10 what happens when you have so much oil money and no idea what to do with it
1107 2018-12-26 21:42:08 Betting that science is wrong and oil companies are right is the dumbest experiement in history by far.

1111 2018-12-26 21:41:45 He’s probably still on property and skulking around Innovations like the a short hydraulic oil dripping Phantom of the Opera.
1112 2018-12-26 21:41:44 Basil, garlic, pine nuts, olive oil and garlic.
1113 2018-12-26 21:41:43 I will never understand why strangers tell me the most random thing, like the guy at the oil change place telling me about tearing his achilles.
1114 2018-12-26 21:41:38 Not everyone knows about your website or how to search on it unless they know the details of what companies own what manufacturers and so on. I'd have though companies using sustainable palm oil would be all too keen to show they're moving in the right direction.
1115 2018-12-26 21:41:13 Lol, I got short again before the close. Only long crypto and oil!
1116 2018-12-26 21:41:09 Who cares about oil!!! Give it up already

1119 2018-12-26 21:40:51 Dec 19 - 152.4 - We wanted to use Seitan powder to fry zucchini, but they didn’t have it at the store. We used sweet lupine powder instead. We tried it fried (in just a little oil) and baked. Both were good, but the baked one was a little dry. #ExperimentalCooking
1120 2018-12-26 21:40:48 Yes! Do everything that deals with my car. Put gas in it, get oil changes, get it washed and everything else. Leave it to me and it won’t get done. 
1121 2018-12-26 21:40:29 i feel like the oil meme
1122 2018-12-26 21:40:27 City are in absolute shambles and I love it. Oil money success is a bitch 
1123 2018-12-26 21:40:26 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Oakland sleeps.
1124 2018-12-26 21:40:26 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Los Angeles sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

1127 2018-12-26 21:40:05 @petreleaf Hello, I wasn’t sure the best way to contact you.  Do you have an email option as well? For smaller breed dogs, like a pug, about 25 lbs. do you recommend the smaller strength of CBD hemp oil, or can you use the large 1700 version, but just dose accordingly?  Thank you

Never , ever trust an economist. One step away from snake oil salesmen.
1129 2018-12-26 21:40:00 Why am I paying taxes to corrupt system who contaminated the swamp & allowed lead bullets to further add toxicity to the region? Palm oil is not normally a product of Canada is it? 
1130 2018-12-26 21:39:57 Y’all. I’m sitting at Mr. Speedy to get my oil changed & this dude is STARING.
1131 2018-12-26 21:39:56 Getting my tire changed and about to get an oil change. Can’t keep riding around bold as hell

1133 2018-12-26 21:39:26 one time i was on the phone with my brother in an uber talking about my bipolar disorder/depression and when i got out of the car my driver told me i should really try THC oil and i think about that a lot
1134 2018-12-26 21:39:11 I’ve changed one important thing for 2019... my diet 
No  more meat for me not eating chicken or turkey anymore. 

No more foods cooked in oils other than avocado oil 

No more caffeine 

Absolutely no more dairy
1135 2018-12-26 21:39:07 What the oil industry pays in taxes is irrelevant. The fact remains that Alberta is fiscally over-reliant on non-renewable natural resource revenues. Even in good years, AB was tapping money from the Heritage Trust Fund to meet spending needs.
1136 2018-12-26 21:39:00 Someone just made +3.09% on WCX: buy Brent Crude Oil 54.983 → 55.068 (20x leverage)  ~ AWWWWW $BCO $USD

1140 2018-12-26 21:38:03 Please push harder to get your members to show your logo on all their packaging, and ask their retailers with online stores to show the logo on their products there as well. If I can't see "sustainable palm oil" in the ingredients or your logo, I will still avoid their products.
1141 2018-12-26 21:37:56 Venezuela, however, doesn't work because all it's oil sales have been embargoed by the OPEC, the Bolivar oil consortium, and has only last year started flowing to China.
1142 2018-12-26 21:37:50 I hope Trump will not do what Bush did Iraq -- start a war on manufactured evidence to "take the oil (Trump said he would)" and enflame the insurgency of Al Queda and eventually ISIS.  If he finds he's caught in a legal corner he will do just that. Oversight is on you!
1143 2018-12-26 21:37:43 He’s pissing in the wind if he thinks that his waffle will have any effect on the sp. I feel a change in the wind says i.
1144 2018-12-26 21:37:39 Yeah ! like the 10-15 % bounce in oil prices.
1145 2018-12-26 21:37:39 Some silly ass nicked our oil  literally got none and it got filled up last week and no one is coming til Friday
1146 2018-12-26 21:37:34 Palliative care will not cure the almost dead patient, only delay its demise.If the left would stop fighting oil pipelines that would be great too.
1147 2018-12-26 21:37:27 The oil didn’t spill by itself.

I’m blaming BP for the one where their equipment failed far underwater.

I’m blaming the non-oil company men that broke into the pipe for the other.  Criminals cause havoc, some more,some less.
1148 2018-12-26 21:37:11 One thing I HATEEEE paying for with my own money is Oil Changes  idk why.
1149 2018-12-26 21:37:07 Ya know. My dad taught me how to change a tire, taught me how to do an oil change, I KNOW that that stuff is important.
But I’m still that dumb bitch that pushes off her oil change until it becomes an issue 
1150 2018-12-26 21:37:05 Whoa. Oil is up almost 10% today. Must be time to tap the SPR. #OOTT
1151 2018-12-26 21:37:04 My headspace is pretty shit lately, anyone know good ways of reducing anxiety besides taking tablets? I've been recommended CBD oil, just haven't got round to getting it yet
1152 2018-12-26 21:36:51 Maybe you need more oil money??
1153 2018-12-26 21:36:48 So now we're all bullish equities and oil. Seems so simple...
1154 2018-12-26 21:36:45 Fight for it like we do. Every one talks shit about us fighting for oil but look now. In 20years uk will be called new mecca and this time we arent bailing you out
1155 2018-12-26 21:36:31 Why was an oil tanker on GSP?

1160 2018-12-26 21:35:31 But such poorly developed villains! The weasely head of 'definitely-not-Spectre' who drowns Gemma Artertons in oil for no reason and General Generic with his five point zero minutes of screen time.
1161 2018-12-26 21:35:30 Nonsense..."track oil prices"? Or might it be that oil prices track inflation expectations or rather NGDP expectations.

1164 2018-12-26 21:34:58 That and the fact I'm sure as an independent country we could manage things differently and not give oil companies massive tax breaks. Maybe even nationalise the industry giving almost all revenue back to treasury.Just a thought. Right now we can't make the best decisions for us
1165 2018-12-26 21:34:55 Sure, but no deposits have been made to the HTF since the late 80s, even when oil prices were high. It has been sapped of income to prop up government spending while Albertans enjoyed low taxes over saving for the future.
1166 2018-12-26 21:34:53 You're in an active war zone, fighting a war for oil, and then the Traitor in Chief comes to visit.... Hmmm. I've fought a battle with cancer, and that was less bad.

1169 2018-12-26 21:34:33 But they're not successful. If i start a business and it fails, tough luck for me. If GM or JP Morgan, bank of america screw up. Here come the bail outs. The list goes on and on. Big pharma- heavily subsidized by tax payers, same for big oil. Name one mom&pop oil company.

1173 2018-12-26 21:34:08 Having Sympathy doesn’t really matter, but being educated does. Norway didn’t “diversify” their economy (no other industry can compete for labor when oil and gas is paying high wages), they invested, which would have been harder for Alberta given its a province subject to 1/
1174 2018-12-26 21:34:01 Seeing shoots of people with hella oil on on white sheets/bedding makes me cringeeee
1175 2018-12-26 21:33:57 Correct! Their costs of providing services were met through taxes paid by present generation. Oil revenues were salted away for rainy days. That took discipline not seen here.

1178 2018-12-26 21:33:50 You could pick up some cuticle oil, or even coconut oil. Make a point to change habits into less irritating hygiene like pushing & trimming them.  Maybe carry a small container of shea or lotion that leaves no residue. Anything that changes a habit to a plus. Hands are your tools
1179 2018-12-26 21:33:47 So true. My family is native from the region. The oil is extracted by foot treading like wine. Tasting the butter, a by-product of oil, still warm directly out of the press is a unique experience. #Benin
1180 2018-12-26 21:33:46 Total bollocks. Venezuela under Chavez and Maduro bet all its chips on high oil prices (while private sector withered). As soon as oil prices fell, economy collapsed.  Asinine economic strategy, doomed to fail. Blaming sanctions a lame excuse for madhouse economics.

1187 2018-12-26 21:32:53 This is all true and while I love my Tesla it should be mentioned that there is a yearly maintenance that costs about $600. My partner always emphasizes that fact when I mention the lack of oil changes compared to his GLS.

Afghanistan was also under Bush and there was that whole oil thing. Obama didn't create ISIS, Trump pulled out of a coalition that will probably end with our allies in that area being slaughtered.

If it’s for an Italian style paste I’ll use 2 eggs beaten to start, about a tablespoon of olive oil, and then I’ll just add flour into the mixer until it gets to the right consistency.
1224 2018-12-26 21:28:27 Is Russia not interested in allowing Ukraine the oil and gas in Crimea? Or is it simply that they want @Poroshenko to sit down with them and discuss without predetermined outcome?

1237 2018-12-26 21:27:25 Had a truly iconic nail salon experience. First the dude soaked my nails in listerine. Then, he rubbed my hands with vegetable oil. Lastly, he sat back and asked me, “so, what do you know about Balut?” Oh buddy. I know plenty about Balut.
1238 2018-12-26 21:27:21 My momma would have slain me...right there!  Lolololol oil
1239 2018-12-26 21:27:17 You’re kidding, right? Whale is a traditional food consumed mostly around coastline of Japan and more popular in the Western part, like Osaka. But every part of a whale is used, oil, even whiskers for instruments. Nothing is wasted.
1240 2018-12-26 21:27:16 @GovHolcomb I appreciate your concern for the law. However, your objections are not clear. You allow cbd oil, but not marijuana. Maybe listen to what your Hoosiers want and go after the Feds to change the law?!
1241 2018-12-26 21:27:03 this body oil my aunty got me is everythingggggg 
1242 2018-12-26 21:27:00 Prices should have gone up after Iran deal scrapping.  You mean prices came down when Trump blinked on oil exports and gave waivers leading to over production glut.
1243 2018-12-26 21:26:55 Too late now but when I was 8 my uncle gave me a litre of car oil.
1244 2018-12-26 21:26:41 I love @japan, always wanted to go and visit, but this is ridiculous. What’s the point of hunting whales? Last I checked, no one lights oil lamps with whale blubber anymore. Go watch Star Trek 4: The Voyage Home, @JapanGov.
1245 2018-12-26 21:26:38 @VP @SecondLady I pray you are supporting BRINGING OUR TROOPS HOME! If you are truly Christian, you will be supporting stopping the lies of Military Industrial Complex and Geni Oil board.
1246 2018-12-26 21:26:09 Oo and it sounds like oil
1247 2018-12-26 21:25:55 No bread, palm oil, or egg I can use with this Indomie. Sigh 
1248 2018-12-26 21:25:39 Oils !!!!! Oil is uncountable 
1249 2018-12-26 21:25:31 Why do we have troops in Iraq 17 years later? US military is incompetent unless of course their real mission is to continue to steal oil.  Bring our troops home!!!!
1250 2018-12-26 21:25:29 It became the cheap stock market: cheap oil, cheap money, and cheap stocks.
Stunning rally today. I hope all my twitter friends held on through the dip.
1251 2018-12-26 21:25:26 "Anyone want a grilled orange?"

Drizzles oil on it.

"With a little coat?"
1252 2018-12-26 21:25:00 Olbas Oil 
1253 2018-12-26 21:24:55 Kicked off a lovely conversation with my Montreal based in-laws during Christmas dinner when I asked them, "What the hell is wrong with Quebec?"

Fortunately they're just as embarrassed by the "We don't want Alberta's dirty oil" comment as the rest of Canada.
1254 2018-12-26 21:24:55 Discovery: while ghee seems like it’d be a perfect popcorn topping, it is not. Salt presence/absence immaterial. Wonder: is the milkfat a critical component to that brain-rush of pleasure? Movie theater topping seems like straight oil but maybe has added casein or something?
1255 2018-12-26 21:24:48 Dm me plz
1256 2018-12-26 21:24:42 Very clever thinking of that veteran: lost my legs and arm in Irak (fighting for oil in name of freedom) so lets build a wall on the border with México, genius!
1257 2018-12-26 21:24:36 Worked perfectly well when Tony Benn set up britoil, very similar to Norway’s statoil, both successful and statoil has created 600 billion oil fund the uk has nothing so state owned oil benefits all not just the frw
1258 2018-12-26 21:24:34 Being in a relationship AND wearing glasses sucks. Whenever Coley hugs or kisses me they get fucked bc he’s dumb and kisses them or his nose/oil touches them and I can’t see. Love you but shit I need contacts.
1259 2018-12-26 21:24:34 My sister in the kitchen cooking, I can smell that garlic frying in the oil.
1260 2018-12-26 21:24:30 Today’s rally speaks for itself. Oil along for the ride interesting.
1261 2018-12-26 21:24:16 Okay any moisturiser . Yone you're supposed to dilute it before use, with an oil or something
1262 2018-12-26 21:24:15 I donttttt want to go get my oil changed 
1263 2018-12-26 21:24:08 Totally didn't mean to eavesdrop, but I'm getting my oil changed and the guy next to me is talking on the phone about how he's traveling for a relatives funeral. Apparently police killed this guy's relative for holding his gf at gunpoint after 7hrs of negotion. Crazy.
1264 2018-12-26 21:24:08 Be careful with kasey around oil diffusers! I heard that some of them aren’t good for animals to be around, not too sure which scents but some aren’t good for animals
1265 2018-12-26 21:23:57 You know the good news....you can re buy it all at the sale price now 
1266 2018-12-26 21:23:53 Well, that’s where we differ. I’ll continue to make decisions based on EVIDENCE, not guesswork and prejudice. If you can point to something in his voting record that shows fealty to oil companies, I’ll look at that.
1267 2018-12-26 21:23:36 Hello tweeps,

 palm oil
sweet and irish potato rice

Drum beans

1268 2018-12-26 21:23:36 el oil acompaña
1269 2018-12-26 21:23:33 And with 300,878 billion barrels of proven oil reserves it stands number one in the world.
1270 2018-12-26 21:23:25 Try bio oil / aloe vera..
1271 2018-12-26 21:23:17 Dead skin cells of the body can be removed by applying mixture of olive oil and salt. Replacing salt with granulated sugar can work too.
1272 2018-12-26 21:23:12 They taking about the price of oil dropping on the news like it’s a bad thing lol
1273 2018-12-26 21:23:08 When has the greatest country in the world ever been unsafe? He sells snake oil and says oh he’s so great! Even they don’t believe the shit they’re shoveling!
1274 2018-12-26 21:23:07 I didn’t notice any reaction with our cats but myself and one of dogs started coughing when it was used. Strangely I can eat a lemon but the essential oil is so concentrated I’m allergic to it.
1275 2018-12-26 21:23:07 Now do deindustrialization/decline of manufacturing, increases in automation leading to increased productivity non related to human labor, increases in immigration legal/ illegal. Correlate those with declines of real wages since favorite benchmark of 1968
1276 2018-12-26 21:23:03 God bless her!  A positive attitude might take some work on my part, but the Oil of Olay I can easily begin now.  And I will.
1277 2018-12-26 21:22:55 Getting an oil change
1278 2018-12-26 21:22:52 47 yakınlarından yapılır 47. 5 üstü SL ile ben yaptım 46.6 ve 46.9 dan 47.2 seviyesi üstünde kalıcılık 4 saatlik olursa yukarı gidecektir. Ama buralardan 45. 45.2 arayan sell girilir ufak SL ile bakılır. Zara olursa olur önemli değil. Ama unutma bende 42.5 üstünde 43 de buy var
1279 2018-12-26 21:22:42 Mimi
1280 2018-12-26 21:22:35 Follow back me
1281 2018-12-26 21:22:31 Good Burn. Had Xmas dinner with future family members who are traditional conservatives. They wonder about the weeping & wailing from the oil workers. There is lots of work out there & the world doesn't owe you a job guarantee. Now that's a real conservative view.
1282 2018-12-26 21:22:26 Haha, good stuff, wrong size and yes I did. Well trained me
1283 2018-12-26 21:22:03 Buying a $17 bottle of olive oil at Whole Foods is the whitest thing I've done in a while
1284 2018-12-26 21:21:56 We're entering a new cycle of trading is all. Top price for $SPY $260 to $262 then selloff continues. Wall Street boys doing there redisturbution into OIL, its gotten very beat up lately.
1285 2018-12-26 21:21:52 Is consumption the problem and not production?  How often have you been to an oil sands facility, if you visit rather than look at pictures you will see how responsible production is.
1286 2018-12-26 21:21:51 Be my beard oil 
1287 2018-12-26 21:21:50 Actual word for word sentence from this podcast: “From the outside looking in, you would think the family had everything. A beautiful family, a happy home, great careers. Chris in the oil industry and Ann in a MULTILEVEL MARKETING COMPANY” WHAT.
1288 2018-12-26 21:21:39 Need an oil change? Did you get in an accident recently? They’ll have your car looking and running like its brand new! Go follow @hudsoncollisiocenter on Instagram! They’ll take care of you and your car
1289 2018-12-26 21:21:27 the fact that we consider Ted Kaczynski a terrorist murderer and we consider Obama a peace prize deserving wonderful human is staggering to me... one fought for humankind and the planet and one killed over 100k people with drones for oil corp's......
1290 2018-12-26 21:21:24  me and behaving are like oil and water
1291 2018-12-26 21:21:22 I would’ve never known I needed air in my tires until I came to get an oil change
1292 2018-12-26 21:21:22 I desperately need oil to run back up and hold steady at $60.
1293 2018-12-26 21:21:16 Rich guys son's don't get drafted, but they sure love sending others son's and daughters to war. Mostly for the protection of big oil profits.
1294 2018-12-26 21:21:06 @twila_oil please follow back me
1295 2018-12-26 21:21:05 Lol I missed that. Where is it? I got distracted by the gun oil lube looking cream.
1296 2018-12-26 21:21:04 Couldn’t have anything to do with the economic reports today that consumer spending is up, could it? Because who would want to put a damper on the economy?
1297 2018-12-26 21:21:01 During the BP oil spill, I called Jeff Sessions office *every* single day

His assistant & I got to know each other so well they told me once that when my number popped up, he poured a drink. 

If you refuse to bug your GOP Congressmen, you’re part of the problem. Drive ‘em nuts
1298 2018-12-26 21:20:54 Yeah right. Working harder doesn't mean spend another £1b of oil money on players.
1299 2018-12-26 21:20:50 Fries to Canola Oil POdcast
1300 2018-12-26 21:20:49 $ going up, oil price dropping and changes to subsidies around the country - Auckland petrol is typically now more expensive rather than being cheaper despite the extra 11c tax
1301 2018-12-26 21:20:39 Pepsi zero?Seriously, a lot of corn syrup in regular. Not to mention stuff that screws up your nervous system.
Hydrogenated vegetable oil.  I know from experience. I switched to tea. Not a solution for everyone.

#I pray let the oil of God fall on you, break any yoke off your neck and take away any burden in your life in the name of JesusChrist of Nazareth!!!!!!!

1303 2018-12-26 21:20:12 Congrats on deciding not to allow oil industry money to influence your decisions anymore we must stand up for environmental justice by standing against oil and natural gas! You have won back a Tampa resident with this decision.
1304 2018-12-26 21:20:10 Where are all those Oil Bears at?  #OOTT $WTIC $XOP @TommyThornton
1305 2018-12-26 21:19:49 Showed my car some love and it didn’t respond well. Lol oil change and low pressure on rear right tire light came on after i washed and waxed it. Bye Audi, bye.
1306 2018-12-26 21:19:48 2/3 of Canadians live in cities and that direction continues. When cities run on free public transpo, EVs, solar wind, the price of oil will collapse.
1307 2018-12-26 21:19:36 I've been fronting on doing this oil change
1308 2018-12-26 21:19:16 I thought they did... Or at least handed it over to their pals in the US/UK oil industries
1309 2018-12-26 21:18:56 油を英訳すると、なんて言うか知ってるかい?
1310 2018-12-26 21:18:49 Rise is unwarranted but oil isjot at the sweet spot yet still low for many

1312 2018-12-26 21:18:28 Anger problems?  Yeah, there's an oil for that.
1313 2018-12-26 21:18:27 Erm, it's ok I think.  Interesting villain, couple of good set pieces and an almost grown up central relationship. Plus, nice to see someone underplaying bond at dramatic moments (the leaky seals scene and motor oil scenes).  But the story does feel a bit slight.
1314 2018-12-26 21:17:55 And in the other Kinder Egg you should of put some garlic and olive oil and taught your children how to cook, you know, like real life skills instead of some self righteous existential bullshit lesson.
1315 2018-12-26 21:17:41 Because you get carry over no mean say oil no dey your head..!!

1317 2018-12-26 21:17:39 That’s a pretty good own, hafts say.

I steer well clear of them. My own hard green Luddite tendencies are strictly ring-fenced to Transport/oil or coal use. Hate plastics too, but bloody hard to get rid of.

1319 2018-12-26 21:17:28 One time I was working on a truck and told you to check the “get up and go grease” then asked you to bring me a bottle of blinker fluid. You proceeded to check it then brought me a bottle of motor oil.

1321 2018-12-26 21:17:25 Capitalism =! Money or commerce. Capitalism = Grifter culture

The snake oil salesmen won & stopped even pretending the snake oil was good
1322 2018-12-26 21:17:24 I’m so exited to clean my room to set up my essential oil diffusers and new sheets with my new candles 
1323 2018-12-26 21:17:15 Oh so nice
1324 2018-12-26 21:17:10 By not meeting with any Iraqi officials at least #Trump didn't make a plea for "the oil". Almost forgot about that long ago declaration of his Elise. #DeadlineWH #msnbc #TrumpShutdown
1325 2018-12-26 21:16:51 Why did you get her presents in the £1 shop Pissing?
Hope you kept the receipts?

1331 2018-12-26 21:16:40 Thanks boo!! I used a leave in while my hair was wet. Then I followed up with Argan oil. Then I chased with the green eco. All the while keeping my hair pretty damp
1332 2018-12-26 21:16:38 This is the world’s slowest “instant” oil change emporium. But they’ve certainly done their best at up-selling.
1333 2018-12-26 21:16:30 Yeah all I have here is tea tree oil and no band aids lol 
1334 2018-12-26 21:16:30 Far too posh, chuck them leftovers in a frying pan with oil and butter, add gravy job done.
1335 2018-12-26 21:16:18 Time for a Trump tweet that oil is too high
1336 2018-12-26 21:16:13 Finally found the cure to my bikini razor bumps: shaving with baby oil. It’s a fucking miracle
1337 2018-12-26 21:16:09 Holy Moses. Crude oil up 10.1%. Brent up 9.3%.
1338 2018-12-26 21:16:07 we’re all on holiday break, or as i like to call it: explain CBD oil to your parents challenge
1339 2018-12-26 21:16:04 @HempzBeauty: What percentage of your "Original" Herbal Body Moisturizer is actually pure Hemp oil. Friend said tests were run & could only find traces. Were these  tests correct?
1340 2018-12-26 21:15:46 Ayyyy I got hooked up with a discount on my oil change
1341 2018-12-26 21:15:44 Hey cat owners! My parents got me and Ro essential oil diffusers, which was kind, but with our cats I'm SUPER wary. There are a lot of conflicting articles online about what you should/shouldn't use, and now I'm nervous about even using the diffuser at ALL. Any experiences...?
1342 2018-12-26 21:15:39 Must suck to be one of those coal rolling Luddites. Lots of oil and gas stock in your portfolio too.
1343 2018-12-26 21:15:39 I've done sous vide steaks the past few times since I'm fortunate enough to have the tools to do it, and it is consistently delicious. Perfect medium rare all the way through. Let it sort of baste in olive oil and garlic and herbs

1347 2018-12-26 21:15:24 A friend recently asked me if I knew the best place to obtain E&O insurance.

I went through Leavitt Group-Stephens & Hobdy Insurance,  My policy is for $500,000, covering both real estate and oil and gas for 1200/yr.

Please share any insights you might have. On other providers.
1348 2018-12-26 21:15:22 You know that haha, plus I need to take the missus shopping so she can return all the stuff I got her lol
1349 2018-12-26 21:15:06 My did coconut oil.  It helped the scaliness
1350 2018-12-26 21:14:56 .Yes!! American Native culture appear to have understanding of universal balance- 
White US culture is based in this lack of understanding, their greed and hording will throw all systems out of balance and into chaos, death. 

Oil over Water is insanity!
1351 2018-12-26 21:14:43 The sooner new owners come in the better for Rafa..... as long as it’s not billionaires oil merchants, can’t be having another rich club take all our glory! 
1352 2018-12-26 21:14:36 I have had that bread. It is really good. My roommate in Italy was from Altamura. We would slice it, toast it in the oven and then drizzle it with my grandmother’s olive oil and rosemary. Yum 
1353 2018-12-26 21:14:19 I have a Canadian oil play long from Monday. CAD markets closed today but open tomorrow. Crude up 10% today!!!! I'll be taking that one home tomorrow.
1354 2018-12-26 21:13:41 Oh my god
1355 2018-12-26 21:13:41 So long as oil is used as a source of energy, when the energy cost of recovering a barrel of oil becomes greater than the energy content of the oil, production will cease no matter what the monetary price may be.

1358 2018-12-26 21:13:29 Ask the oil companies.

1360 2018-12-26 21:13:04 That tuppence probably helped finance a coup somewhere, with interest received in the form of oil and mining rights...
1361 2018-12-26 21:13:02 Lol! The oil worker supports trump, go figure.
1362 2018-12-26 21:12:54 Snake oil anyone?
1363 2018-12-26 21:12:39 For every barrel of oil we give you three pounds of $FAANG stock certificates.
1364 2018-12-26 21:12:36 oil more important in my opinion, hopefully we see it stabilize
1365 2018-12-26 21:12:29 @realDonaldTrump sir don’t leave without the oil we’re using to pay for The Wall

1368 2018-12-26 21:12:12 Oh, this really looks delightful. Glad you shared a video. It's beautiful & how terrific that you can add a soothing oil, too!

1372 2018-12-26 21:11:38 To me stupidity is part of the Code of Conduct of APC followership. These SHALLOW-MINDED Dumbs forgot that half of the 16 years of PDP had crude oil being sold below $70 per barrel the same price it has been sold under APC. Despite this PDP Cleared Debt APC Accumulated Debt
1373 2018-12-26 21:11:30 In 2010 a BP drilling rig exploded, killing 11 workers and spewing over 636 million litres of oil into the ocean. The marine in the Gulf of Mexico still feels this impact even today. Scientists say it has altered (read damaged) “even the smallest microorganisms” in that area.

1378 2018-12-26 21:11:00 You tried hemp oil?
1379 2018-12-26 21:10:55 Horrible that the child died, but turning these ppl loose into the country and risks of possibly infecting others? This political chess being played with these people's lives is the most disgusting thing I've seen in a long while.
1380 2018-12-26 21:10:55 I always dump a little extra oil in before I get an oil change so they don’t see the embarrassingly low oil level my cars been operating at for weeks 
1381 2018-12-26 21:10:54 My brother getting my car washed andddd my oil changed, aint that a blessing 
1382 2018-12-26 21:10:52 เห็นพนง.บอกคนมาถามกันเยอะเลย ตอนไปเหลือยุเท่าที่เห็นเลยจ้า
1383 2018-12-26 21:10:45 got into my car after work to a fresh oil change and full tank of gas. 
1384 2018-12-26 21:10:41 great message brought to you by INfoWars the certifiable news source for the certifiably insane. Just heard from your boss and he asks you to come in early today to change the oil in the fry cooker.
1385 2018-12-26 21:10:20 Elon Musk: “We know we’ll run out of dead dinosaurs to mine for fuel & have to use sustainable energy eventually, so why not go renewable now & avoid increasing risk of climate catastrophe? Betting that science is wrong & oil companies are right is the dumbest experiment in …
1386 2018-12-26 21:10:19 Me too use argan oil have one for face and neck (Argandia) it's sublime  lol we're similar

1388 2018-12-26 21:10:03 夏とかTシャツに油のシミできるよねえ。あれ透けるからほぼ全裸みたいになるよ僕。
1389 2018-12-26 21:10:01 If we took resource development do you honestly think we would have the high incomes that pay the higher taxes? Without our resources developed there is no money to give to anyone. Simple concept to understand. Fact: oil/gas development drives the high incomes.
1390 2018-12-26 21:09:56 home made chilli oil too

1392 2018-12-26 21:09:42 i drink black coffee with coconut oil in it too - not for any reason other than it tastes fantastic

what’s your reason?
1393 2018-12-26 21:09:26 I'm also getting a battery and oil ND a filter
1394 2018-12-26 21:09:21 #SPX #WTI under $42 sets off the bad oil debt. We bounced right off it. Not ready to start default . FED could be changing its mind???
1395 2018-12-26 21:09:20 Oil shot up through the roof today and literally everything on the watch list was green

Options contracts shot .25 to 9$. Magical
1396 2018-12-26 21:09:19 Seinfeld Bear Market ..a Bear market about nothing ..just GET TRUMP.. like the oil ratchet before the elections
1397 2018-12-26 21:09:12 Just don't eat it all at once  the orange oil acts like a laxative 
1398 2018-12-26 21:09:10 Chris Watts was a "good guy" too until he strangled his family and dumped their bodies in oil.
1399 2018-12-26 21:08:52 Really? Russia’s #1 source of $$ is oil. President Trump opened American giant energy industry Result Russia is screwed #Americafirst thank u Mr President

Cycle
Like a Boss

- Powell
- China talks
- Helping hand from the Russians on oil and Amazon on retail sales
1401 2018-12-26 21:08:47 I'd say YOU are the one in denial. Nowhere do we say they're the same level of evil, but please, open your eyes to the fact that our corporate/investor/oil overlords infected the Democratic party & helped kill unions, privatize everything, deregulate, & slash social programs.
1402 2018-12-26 21:08:42 Tea tree oil actually works.. its been a week (I haven't even been that consistent) and my dark marks are slowly fading 
1403 2018-12-26 21:08:31 Drop of grapefruit oil in water is an appetite suppressant
1404 2018-12-26 21:08:21 Stocks stage manic rally after Xmas Eve plunge as buyers flood back in. Dow ends +1,086, +5.0% to 22,878 -- back to where it was early last Fri.

Nasdaq +5.8%, S&P 500 +5.0.

Crude oil also rebounds, +9.9% to $46.75.

So it's "risk on" again -- but for how long?
1405 2018-12-26 21:08:15 Good lord . It’s like petulant childishness meets fragile oil field masculinity.
1406 2018-12-26 21:07:52 Even these windmillls need oil to move and work.
1407 2018-12-26 21:07:45 He arranged the new cycle like a boss from Powell to the China talks plus a helping hand ironically from his nemesis Bezos and a ironic helping hand from the Russians on oil

Wowyzers
1408 2018-12-26 21:07:45 You trust Oil and water to agree on the right coaches? The facts that they’re (Ellis and Elway) not on the same page is frightening.
1409 2018-12-26 21:07:41 nope -he's just one long oil slick of lies
1410 2018-12-26 21:07:34 Streaming from mobile, hit a certain donation goal to destroy a piece of my setup..hmmm you may have struck oil there 
1411 2018-12-26 21:07:24 Oil +10%
1412 2018-12-26 21:07:15 yup. that's the last of oil/gas middlemen of your gasoline before it's in the tank
1413 2018-12-26 21:07:07 Phew, like coconut oil?
1414 2018-12-26 21:07:01 Trie olive oil bby
1415 2018-12-26 21:06:59 Hey UAE don't send your crap in my feed! I did not ask for it and don't want it! Drink oil all you Royal fuckheads!
1416 2018-12-26 21:06:49 And can receive required oil changes at any participating location.
1417 2018-12-26 21:06:36 So it wasn’t quite 15 min to set up the @ecobee 3 lite, more like 3 hours. Not an intensive period but few of the settings map to my previous thermostat. Heat pump ran right away, the next 2 1/2 hours were spent getting it to turn on the oil furnace. Google Home now sees it too.
1418 2018-12-26 21:06:35 If you've read anything I've written you'll know my position is we are at the end of the oil era. Future energy currencies will be based on energy as a service & accounted in an energy unit of account
1419 2018-12-26 21:06:32 I now know the difference between transmission fluid and gear oil
1420 2018-12-26 21:06:19 What?! ERM.. What is this new madness?
You are an the Kashoggi, women stoning Saudis who fund terrorism?
Perchance they are going into Syria because their oil boom is coming to an end?
Or Putin and Assad are friends and MBS needs positive press and you get a cut?
Hmmmm
1421 2018-12-26 21:06:16 coconut oil helps!
1422 2018-12-26 21:06:02 Remind yourself also now that America is the #1 producer of oil and gas does both to Saudi Arabia and Russia. It crushes them both. Thank u President Trump for putting #Americafirst
1423 2018-12-26 21:05:59 His FEC filings say he took multiple $2,700 donations from oil execs and other high dollar donations and was cut from the No Fossil Fuel Money pledge for doing so. Maybe he didn't take pac $, but at this point it's splitting hairs. $ went from capitalist donors to his pockets.
1424 2018-12-26 21:05:55 I got half the day off work today and it took almost three hours to get my oil changed and tires rotated so there went all my time to do stuff. 
1425 2018-12-26 21:05:45 I think you can break the system if you just ask them to fry it in water instead of oil. They won't see through that.
1426 2018-12-26 21:05:45 Nice day today with oil and ES running.
1427 2018-12-26 21:05:37 GREED IS.... GOOD! It’s the oil that keeps Capitalism working.
1428 2018-12-26 21:05:30 My love for cbd oil is getting out of hand
1429 2018-12-26 21:05:23 Just had my #BubbleAndSqueak. It was bloody lovey. Start with butter and chilli oil in the frying pan, chuck in some left over pork and season with some crushed garlic and chilly, then add a splash of soy sauce. Cook for 5min and then add all the left over veg and heat thoroughly
1430 2018-12-26 21:05:21 Feel so grateful my favorite Italian restaurant makes me vegan heaven amazing mushrooms with home made pasta and side of Calabria peppers.  I cant run my knees shot but olive oil so fattening wish I could run 6 miles now.  Kindest service all around happy
1431 2018-12-26 21:04:59 It is a great start. Further, you can charge the candle with intention by blessing it, anointing it with blessed oil, casting a protective Circle (depending on your beliefs and preferences there are many methods to do this), charge the cards (reset them) after each reading, etc.
1432 2018-12-26 21:04:49 Done for the day, see y’all tomorrow #CL_F #Es_f #oil #oott #spy $spy anybody have a twitter dictation app/software they like?

1434 2018-12-26 21:04:48 If you only drill for 1 barrell of oil a day, oil is in short supply, its not scarce.

Artificial supply control doesnt mean something is scarce.

I guess BTCers will find out block space isnt scarce when other cryptos like BSV will offer unlimited block space.
1435 2018-12-26 21:04:46 Isn’t most electricity in US made by burning oil?
1436 2018-12-26 21:04:30 yeah i cooked the black pudding 1st, but it was quite a dense one so it got a bit dry when cold -  so the oil really did help :-) i will admit that i'm all cooked out now, so the 3 i tried were just enough - they really are very good indeed, Diane - sorry about that ;-)
1437 2018-12-26 21:04:29 "Oil change" and "air filter"  I get you
1438 2018-12-26 21:04:27 Let’s see oil is down, companies are buying back stocks & they received tax breaks from @realDonaldTrump he just announced we are pulling out of   and Syria! 17 years in  and the market doesn’t like it?? The 1% & the WAR MACHINE don’t like it! #NoMoreWar #WakeUpAmerica

1441 2018-12-26 21:04:09 Gram flour and cumin, mix to a thick paste with water. Grate the sprouts into the mix, drop into hot oil a lump at a time.  

Yoghurt turmeric and coriander sauce.
1442 2018-12-26 21:03:57 Don't worry, the selling is far from over!! Top $SPY target from here is $260 to $262. Then more downside through 2019......

Need to be in OIL now, that's where Wall Street redistribution money will be going.
1443 2018-12-26 21:03:55 Beto is a puppet of oil companies and banks, of course he’s a threat.

1448 2018-12-26 21:03:29 Oil workers have it bad as well.  95% laid off in 2014, only about 40-55% back to work now.  The govt employees have it no worse.  My sympathy on disabled vet part.  As for employers govt or private.  We all live and die by our chosen profession and employer.
1449 2018-12-26 21:03:22 "It was a dark and dreary night. Kramer's husband returns home from a long night of work to find everything has been deep-fried. All the meat, frozen food still in the package, ice cubes, all deep fried. Even the furniture was crispy and smelled of delicious cooking oil."

1459 2018-12-26 21:02:16 A great place to blow as a musician is Port Harcourt among THE RICH if you want good money, not because of shows/endorsements. But because of how the oil magnates and Businessmen there will treat you. All you need is at least one nationwide hit. Waconzy even has a Lekki mansion.
1460 2018-12-26 21:02:15 Whose number is $5 billion? If it's trump's, it will end up $500 billion. If based on research, the "F" Factor will raise it to at least $15 billion plus. He's a snake oil salesman people. Read the fine print "For only $5 billion your border... (in 12 easy payments of $5 B each)"
1461 2018-12-26 21:02:12 LW: Oil futures, which came under heavy pressure last week and Monday, were in rebound mode,
1462 2018-12-26 21:01:57 Now youre doing mental gymnastics.

The price goes up because the supply is artificially supressed.

Its like only drilling for 1 barrel of oil a day and then saying 1M a gallon is a fine price.
1463 2018-12-26 21:01:44 This is an entirely different issue though, & as far as I know the cleanup was mostly done (or supervised) by the City of Calgary. My impression is that there's very little supervision of reclamation around the oil sands, & what the public is told comes from oil company PR depts.
1464 2018-12-26 21:01:35 Today is a great reminder of why markets aren’t like everything else. 

“I knew this was coming”

“I nailed the 10% rip in oil to the tick”

“Santa rally always after x-mas”

“U mad bro?”

1465 2018-12-26 21:01:34 Honestly, no. It's not even much credit. Really it is giving Trump too much credit for actually feeling guilty when really he is trying to snake oil america to think he cares so he can golf
1466 2018-12-26 21:01:19 Yes, hips and spine.
Fused vertebrae. He’s on light steroids and CBD oil.

It’s happened to several of my dogs over the past 30 years, most older than this one.

I try and give a good quality of life until they let me know they’ve had enough.

It said the public statement “does not constitute an offer to sell or solicitation of an offer to buy any of the ordinary shares
1468 2018-12-26 21:01:00 does anyone actually use baby oil for babies?
1469 2018-12-26 21:01:00 Went to a Class A State Football game at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis. No band. I could actually hear the game from my first row seat. Terrible.
1470 2018-12-26 21:00:59 I realize this but baby powder and ignitions have nothing to do with oil well clean ups....
1471 2018-12-26 21:00:55 I wouldn’t have thought of adding a bit of olive oil - good idea that obviously worked. Darn, those look delicious!!
1472 2018-12-26 21:00:55 As equity markets approach close: S&P is up 5% and WTI closed up almost 10% after equities’ worst Christmas Eve in history, stocks have best day since 2009 #equities #oil
1473 2018-12-26 21:00:52 I'm changing my oil right now. When you trying to go?? And you telling me..... it's better than Yume's?
1474 2018-12-26 21:00:46 The $SPY target is $260 to $262 then more downside. This is the time of year of asset redisturbution, watch the OIL sector, that one will be on fire!!

1478 2018-12-26 21:00:20 “Average hourly wage growth has been 2.7 percent over the past year, anemic given the power and length of the economic expansion. Making matters worse, a surge of inflation, driven by higher oil prices, has clawed back almost all those wage gains” NYT

1480 2018-12-26 20:59:58 All for oil. gulf wAr was because US and Kuwait were violating opec quotas and pumping Iraqi border oil excessively and saddam took possession and  drove out the criminal US
1481 2018-12-26 20:59:51 I would rather see people ,especially menopausal women, focus on eliminating N-6 oil, increasing Protein intake above true Ketogenic guidelines & dropping fat to 55-60% of total calories rather than the 75-80% recommended for ketosis. Different situations call for different focus
1482 2018-12-26 20:59:46 Your oil refinaries 
Your money.

Spend the way you want...
1483 2018-12-26 20:59:44 That is scary. Putin is a stone cold killer and mob boss leader of a country that teeters on the brink of economic turmoil due to fluctuating oil prices, sanctions. He also seems insecure. (Evidence: shirtless horseback photos, state media which effusively praises him .)
1484 2018-12-26 20:59:42 You spelled #NoCollusion wrong. And Putin's gas station of a country is about to implode from low oil prices because Trump unleashed US energy sector. How about policy proposals instead of name calling ?
1485 2018-12-26 20:59:32 I have never heard blowing oil executives for money called, "affordable and sustainable" before.  But whatever you have to tell yourself.

1489 2018-12-26 20:59:05 Isn't oil a natural resource just like gold and diamonds? I am assuming you are Muslim. I am assuming you are Muslim. Dont you ever why Allah granted the Arabs the gift of oil while not the Turks?
1490 2018-12-26 20:59:02 @Walmart why is my oil change taking 2.5 hours??? this is actually pathetic.
1491 2018-12-26 20:58:59 They’re trying to hurt the economy
1492 2018-12-26 20:58:56 This is what the MSM does...

1493 2018-12-26 20:58:53 What if it has THC oil in it
1494 2018-12-26 20:58:52 AN INTELLIGENT CONSTRUCTION WORKER SAID, "They want us to work, making widgets, building for them, while they print money by pumping oil. Thanks to the West, the preferred privileged class in the Middle East are living the 'American Dream," 
@SheilaGunnReid we"re the slaves.
1495 2018-12-26 20:58:47 In general a country's stock market depends on 3 things, 1. Military 2. Oil and 3. Trade. And #US has shut off all 3 and still wants it's stock market to rise. 

If the owner stands stubborn anyone can see it's going to fail very bad.
1496 2018-12-26 20:58:41 It’s very much like that but our society is not the only one that is going through it except few developed countries the whole world is facing it even the rich oil producers one common factor illiterate people and in numbers on top no resources in most countries
1497 2018-12-26 20:58:34 the cheese ones will mellow out a bit when they've cooled - but the black pudding ones really are very good indeed - i'm glad i added that dash of olive oil, too :-) they'll keep me going for a few days ;-)
1498 2018-12-26 20:58:30 what a nice bounce in #oil, and the markets.... always buy fear, sell greed.

1502 2018-12-26 20:58:04 I worked with a soil scientist who was a contractor with an oilsands company. He said they showed him a field that was black with oil they had "reclaimed" with some magic bacteria process. He said it was black because of the oil, & they had convinced themselves it was black dirt.

1508 2018-12-26 20:57:35 Still admire their CD... Midnight Oil... 
1509 2018-12-26 20:57:31 @AsdaServiceTeam @Tesco @bp @Shell @Total @TexacoGasTX @sainsburys @ExxonMobil_UK almost a 40% reduction in oil over the last few weeks and still very little movement on the pump prices move up next day when increasing but never falls same rate @CMAgovUK #cartel #FuelPrice #uk

1514 2018-12-26 20:56:30 Okay I’ve been waiting for two hours just for an oil change 
1515 2018-12-26 20:56:27 Have you tried Sambucol, Oil of Oregano, and/or Zinc tablets? Sambucol saved my life a few weeks ago... and I know OfO/Zinc have been lifesavers in my office.
1516 2018-12-26 20:56:20 Ecco questo si mancava. Ma perché fa male il palm oil? Ussignur...
1517 2018-12-26 20:56:20 Makes no economic sense to pump oil across Canada when we have Hibernia.
1518 2018-12-26 20:56:17 I thinks it’s the ‘fluffy’ that does the trick. The oil clings to it and has a rough surface to crispen on (*crispen? A word?) 
1519 2018-12-26 20:56:11 to that you can add oil companies chemical companies paper companies and plastics
1520 2018-12-26 20:56:08 I really respected Nigeria as a country.but now.......
A country dat is so rich in oil reserves cannot even fix electricity problem.
U enjoy lights for just 36 hours in Lagos and you are all over Twitter thanking the central government.
I like my Ghana like DAT!
1521 2018-12-26 20:56:08 I am afraid that if the EU will not change its policies towards Russia this will happen also with all the Russian gas, oil, etc. China and Japan, etc. will buy all that stuff that will be for all of them even more efficient and cheaper than to send it to the EU
1522 2018-12-26 20:56:06 US funds terrorist rebels to overthrow governments to take possession of oil and suprised saddam gassed em?
1523 2018-12-26 20:55:54 Try Preheating your pan with butter instead of oil & cook on like low low heat to make it fluff haha (watches too much food channel)
1524 2018-12-26 20:55:37 Technically it does it's job but it is true that many times they fuck up and break apart because of the oil pressure.
1525 2018-12-26 20:55:33 Getting long signal on 2min #oott #oil I can’t type fast enuff
1526 2018-12-26 20:55:30 Things to fix: 3D graphs are hard to read at best, misleading at worst. Stick to 2D. Also you need to factor in energy required to mfgr PV cells vs. mine coal/enrich uranium/build oil wells and syphon off the natural gas.

1529 2018-12-26 20:55:08 Richard spoiled me for Christmas I love him!!! He is so funny the way he wrapped my presents anyways one of the presents they said “choose wisely” and I open it and it’s freaking oil! Still making fun of me as if I didn’t learn my lesson 
1530 2018-12-26 20:55:08 Bet he’s asking about the oil. #BoneSpurs
1531 2018-12-26 20:55:00 Qamishli us to important for Syria. Internatopnal airport and quite ruch field of oil/gas incl. gas plant in Rumeilan. I believe they will not give it away.
1532 2018-12-26 20:55:00 I need to write down everything I have to accomplish this week. Oil change, phone bill, order school books, PAY RENT 
1533 2018-12-26 20:54:56 The original is still full of garbage, mostly sugar and palm oil. Once you graduate to proper chocolate, there is no way back.
1534 2018-12-26 20:54:52 @KT_So_It_Goes of course not, we didn't take all their oil yet

1536 2018-12-26 20:54:28 This no hammer and oversold bounce can reject or weak monthly signal?
Oil sector might made first bottom, and test again under BB after few weeks later if this market and oil are alive.

1538 2018-12-26 20:54:19 So beautiful
1539 2018-12-26 20:54:14 That's not what he's suggesting. Capitalism works when the 'product' provides a benifit to society. Your income should reflect a positive output into the world (or a smaller system). People like the Kardashians are snake oil salesmen turned billionaires.
1540 2018-12-26 20:54:08 No they don't. The global supply of oil is far larger than demand. Asia is well supplied with all they heavy oils they need. To break into that market we need to undercut prices. Which means a wider differential when you factor in shipping via afromax vs VLCC.
1541 2018-12-26 20:54:01 Treasuries have widened out. Risk on. Crude oil is up almost 10%. The S&P up 3%+. The explanation on BBG? “Calming words from our fearless leaders”. Unclear to me that anyone actually knows what they’re doing.
1542 2018-12-26 20:53:37 BREAKING OIL IS UP 9% TODAY? AND THE MARKET IS UP 4%? HUMMMMM?
1543 2018-12-26 20:53:34 I made posters proclaiming my friendship with Germany. who's Canada? I wonder what would get virgin olive oil from?
1544 2018-12-26 20:53:29 Fail of the day. Coming into today long #SPX and #Oil, but cashing out of both only catching 25% of the move, because I was fixated on getting jerked around by #natgas.
1545 2018-12-26 20:53:20 I don’t know of anyone yet. But I would try Parish Oil or Western Petroleum here, they deliver propane and could be helpful. Good luck Matt!
1546 2018-12-26 20:53:14 How is it "progressive" to deregulate banks, help start 5 new wars, encourage walls all across europe to curb immigration, taking money from the oil industry to frack, and saying single payer will "never ever come to pass".

How is this "progressive"?
1547 2018-12-26 20:53:11 I'm not an American but just out of academic curiosity

What exactly do u mean by "take on"? 

Like shut them down or run them the way u like or what exactly do you plan to do? Let's take Exxon Mobil & Chevron as examples. They're oil companies. 

So how will you "taken them on"?
1548 2018-12-26 20:53:10 According to Saudi energy minister Khalid al-Falih, Saudi Aramco and Saudi Arabia’s sovereign fund are close to investing in the Russian oil production equipment manufacturer Novomet and Eurasia Drilling Company #OOTT
1549 2018-12-26 20:53:00 Idk man I just feel like I really got my life together when I cook with coconut oil
1550 2018-12-26 20:52:57 Crude oil gained today as U.S. equities rebounded and Russia signaled that OPEC & its partners would be willing to meet as needed to help manage the oil market.
1551 2018-12-26 20:52:52 Collagen oil
1552 2018-12-26 20:52:45 this is exactly the kind of nonsense the world let's the US get away with. The sad irony is that they dub these crusades as peace missions kill hundreds of thousands then send in "USAID" to help. politics is complex but this killing innocents for oil and money cant be justified
1553 2018-12-26 20:52:43 Massaging your scalp with peppermint oil >>>>>>> Sex
1554 2018-12-26 20:52:31 Including Avo Oil, it is one of the fruit that can produce cooking oil. See here;
I am with you on this one my lady.
1555 2018-12-26 20:52:15 my dad has been complaining that the hood on my truck has been sitting weird and he opens the hood to check the oil and @Nissan left their pliers in my hood from the last oil change 
1556 2018-12-26 20:51:58 I was gonna go get a oil change after work but, it’s raining and by the time I’m done it’ll be dark soooo Issa no for today
1557 2018-12-26 20:51:50 cant wait for the summer so i can slap on this oil control clay mask everyday
1558 2018-12-26 20:51:49 I hope my car is okay after this fuckin oil change :(
1559 2018-12-26 20:51:48 i got my oil changed today for the first time by myself, i was only suppose to get 5% off but i got 10% and didn’t pay that much for it, i’m so happy

1561 2018-12-26 20:51:37 Palm oil I think 
1562 2018-12-26 20:51:28 If its by that logic, of course oil is relevant. Femi Otedola is only pulling out from one area of oil business (marketing and retailing) to invest in another (refining)
1563 2018-12-26 20:51:21 That's so thoughtful of her!  We recommend our Wegmans Basting Oil. It's a unique item, and small enough to fit in a suitcase.  Of course, she/you will have to check flight restrictions, and customs regulations to be certain this can be transported.

“The gov't is doing its best to curb its reliance on oil revenues. This is a long-term plan” #OOTT …
1565 2018-12-26 20:50:52 Oil is making big gains in the stock market. Biggest since November 2016. Looks like there was a plan with getting the stock market falling and now it's coming back up. Oh by the way, Russia's biggest moneymaker is oil!
1566 2018-12-26 20:50:35 America gives millions & billions of$$ to almost every country in the world. We rebuilt Japan & Germany after they tried to kill us. We protect them at OUR expense. Germany has become a wealthy country & wants us to protect them from Russia.Yet they buy oil from Russia & not us.

1585 2018-12-26 20:48:43 When oil keeps falling ?
1586 2018-12-26 20:48:42 you don't think there would be less unemployment if we used more of our oil.
Your dreaming if you think we will ever be off oil in the next 50 years so why buy others when we can have canadians working at decent paying jobs that oil would bring.fuk the usa
1587 2018-12-26 20:48:26 WTI #Oil up nearly 10% to $46.60 on a long-overdue bounce, the largest since Nov 30, 2016. However, it is being driven by dip-buying, not news. If you missed this bounce, you missed it. I wouldn't chase oil at these levels but would instead wait for a pullback & some storage data
1588 2018-12-26 20:48:25 Waiting for the Washington Post story reporting on the millionaire sponsored anti-Canada oil campaign.  It's pretty much destroyed a $17 trillion industry in Canada.  And it's all based on lies and disinformation.  @FairQuestions
1589 2018-12-26 20:48:08 We are very sorry to hear that, however, oil based perfumes like any other perfumes are produced in different batches, most probably the issue is your oil is from the latest batch that was produced, it takes at least 2/4 weeks to settle down & mature. Give it some more time.
1590 2018-12-26 20:48:08 Muka saia kalah:',ngasih tau aja kalau muka oily jangan pake produk2 yg matte soalnya nanti respon sebum dikuliat ketahan dan malah mgehasilin oil lagi yg dikira kita kekurangan oil grgr pake produk matte,jadi disaranin pakai produk yg moist di kulit biar nyeimbangin

1594 2018-12-26 20:47:46 Little vinegar and oil. Sprinkle some salt,
1595 2018-12-26 20:47:43 Um.  Anyone remember the last time we saw frequent 5% gains and 5% losses in equities?  The direction doesn't matter... the magnitude does.  This is not healthy.  Oh, oil is up 10% too?   [selling everything]
1596 2018-12-26 20:47:32 Crude oil futures for February skyrocket Wednesday afternoon, $WTI_Crude +9.52% at $46.58 & $NBZ_F +8.66% at $54.84, $USO +5.80% at $9.83 on 12/26/2018.
1597 2018-12-26 20:47:32 So dabs are just concentrates of flower right, but there are different methods of extraction.  Most common is butane. When you buy hash it will say bho, pho or sho. B= butane hash oil P=propane hash oil. What you want is Sho- solventless hash oil. They only use ice and water

1599 2018-12-26 20:47:06 Do not go to Walmart the day after Christmas. Do not try to get your oil changed the day after Christmas. Basically, just DON’T LEAVE THE HOUSE the day after Christmas because everyone and their mama is out on the town.
1600 2018-12-26 20:47:03 Going to be selling prints of my dads artwork hopefully within a month so be on the lookout - he makes amazing psych art with oil pastels and they only 3 of his 100+ pieces have been on display. So very rare.

1615 2018-12-26 20:45:38 ...okay so this paper I used was NOT made for oil pastels...
1616 2018-12-26 20:45:25 My oil change guy in Longwood (who’s great—I’ve been going there for years) always has the Sean Hannity show playing. What I’ve learned so far today is if a wall is good enough for the Pope, it’s good enough for the USA.
1617 2018-12-26 20:45:22 90% sure it's the head gasket on this van...I figured as much but did some looking into it.. Oil and antifreeze Doesn't seem to be mixing but using it somehow and white smoke out of the tail pipe
1618 2018-12-26 20:45:21 I always find it fascinating that #Gold (let alone #Silver) seldom can muster a 1%+ rally, but the world's biggest commodity (oil) can have 10% swings...
1619 2018-12-26 20:45:09 Chanting the Mantra " Om Ham Hanumate Rudratamakaye Hum Fat" in morning after bath in front of Lord Hanuman with a Dipak of Chameli oil is highly suggested to keep you safe from Black Magic.

1623 2018-12-26 20:44:58 Holy moly poor Oil jersey collectors of late.
1624 2018-12-26 20:44:58 It would be interesting to see if you added up all the petrol and consumables (oil filters pads discs tyres), and the service costs on a Tesla, how long you’d have to own one before it makes financial sense.
1625 2018-12-26 20:44:45 And yet dumping millions of litres of raw sewage into the St. Lawrence is just fine with you people? 

No exploration -- but keep those foreign oil tankers coming! 
1626 2018-12-26 20:44:40 When married I wanted to do the "Oil Slick" rainbow hair style (it was a process popular in 2014-5 and was great for people with dark hair becuase it didn't require bleaching as much.) My then-wife wasn't too high on the idea, though.
1627 2018-12-26 20:44:31 Or they’ll throw a whole lot of oil money at it
1628 2018-12-26 20:44:31 I don't care. Stop attacking good Democrats if they take oil money. We aren't all Bernies who prefer to take millions in foreign donations and then lie and say it's all small donations from Americans. Go Kamala and Beto.

1631 2018-12-26 20:44:15 The problem that people have with your attacks on O'Rourke is that you're misrepresenting what he's actually done. Small-money donors who work in oil gave his campaign money, while he refused corporate money altogether. How would he go about stopping the former, exactly?
1632 2018-12-26 20:44:12 This is absolutely true but, unless you live a lifestyle circa 1800, you benefit in many ways from the production of oil, gas, and its associated byproducts. Meaningful criticism of the status quo needs to include methods that don’t involve returning humanity to the Stone Age.
1633 2018-12-26 20:44:08 He pledged not to take PAC or oil executives money. He lied and took it. They removed him from the pledge because he broke the pledge. If it's not true, where is he to defend it? You just do more hand waving despite what the sponsors of the pledge have said.

This is just crazy..at D end of this admin, GEJ's corruption tales will be a child's play.
1638 2018-12-26 20:43:41 What takes a dealership so long to change oil? @Valvoline can literally do this in like 10 minutes. Been at the dealership for over an hour.
1639 2018-12-26 20:43:35 I’d stake my reputation on it.  Leftovers incl roast parsnips, sprouts, cooked in butter AND oil
1640 2018-12-26 20:43:35 All over the continent bro. Introducing infrastructure, in Ghana specifically, they're capitalizing on new oil found there. Building all kinds of stuff. Short term shit, that will leave African nations indebted to the Chinese government indefinitely.
1641 2018-12-26 20:43:26 He did go to war over oil. Or are you still deluded? Just because he did many things wrong doesn’t mean he cant be quoted on things that made sense. It’s called maturity.

1644 2018-12-26 20:42:51 WE, again, WE have been getting that oil for decades.  Way before Trump. Do you plan to stop filling your tank in protest?   Obama did it, Clinton did it, Reagan did it, Bush did it.  Now that Trump carries on there are complaints? Pathetic.
1645 2018-12-26 20:42:43 I thought oil changes were free 
1646 2018-12-26 20:42:39 oil painting is confusing I’m confused I haven’t even started and my brain hurts
1647 2018-12-26 20:42:28 A lot of stuff to help me with my photography, an essential oil diffuser, some new shirts, and some new pants 
1648 2018-12-26 20:42:27 “Virgin is a type of olive oil.”

Nods.
1649 2018-12-26 20:42:18 The gross ignorance of this response is shameful...and, sad. Evidently, fact-based science &  using simple common sense is a challenge.
Quick lesson-
Oil spills, chemically saturated wastewater, seismic blasting for a finite resource=bad
#RenewableEnergy ,healthy ecosystems=good
1650 2018-12-26 20:42:17 Me: Make sure you don’t roll my windows down then won’t come back up

1662 2018-12-26 20:41:06 I mean some bits are also right with the servicing. However I've only had an oil change on my previous car once and never really worried about the minor services. All other repairs I've had on previous cars have been usual wear and tare (Tyres & Suspension)

1664 2018-12-26 20:40:56 I'd be curious to see a better breakdown of donation amounts. Someone who works for the for the oil industry, who gives $200 is counted in this same group as some executive giving thousands. These aren't the same thing in my opinion. I'll figure out who I'm voting for in 2020.
1665 2018-12-26 20:40:52 I don't see that...I see a beautiful family. But that is just typical of me.
1666 2018-12-26 20:40:50 A thumbs up was given .

❛ Right !  ❜

He then made his way to the pan with the oil in his hands , pouring just a small drop . 

A small sizzle could be hurt from the contact of the oil and heat .

Soon after , the blonde started to whisk up the eggs with a fork .

1668 2018-12-26 20:40:38 Also decarbonization will be bad economically for many people who have skills in fossil fuel industries. Perhaps a oil rig engineer has some skills that can be applied to solar, but a lot of people are going to be hurt by decarbonization. We have to understand its not all win win
1669 2018-12-26 20:40:35 Oil change complete. Freaking finally

1673 2018-12-26 20:40:13 Naw fr lol, I need the oil to keep my shit moisturized lbs!  if not, my shit gets knotty and clumped up. Plus the oil gives it a sexy shine . But if you start using it, you’ll see what I mean haha.

And journalists don't answer to politicians.
1677 2018-12-26 20:39:46 I got olive oil on the outside of a brand new olive oil bottle and I mean, it seems like the only solution is throwing it away

1679 2018-12-26 20:39:41 Is he taking all the oil on the way out?
1680 2018-12-26 20:39:39 I did. The day before. Tyres, oil and I knew the battery was flat and knew I had a jump start piece of kit which would & did get me going....alas the car stalled before the battery had charged properly. Note it was the car!!!!

1682 2018-12-26 20:39:27 Most of year, Fed policy was easier than Taylor Rule.  If it is not now it is only marginal.  Other factors at work in driving prices than inflation expectations.  Things like positioning, drop in oil prices, receding but not ending fiscal stimulus, unsustainable growth in Q2-3.

1687 2018-12-26 20:38:57 A4: I made all the main food as well as an 80s xmas eve buffet (devilled eggs, vol au vents, you know the sort of thing). Also made latkes for the first time in yeaaars. Forgot how badly the oil stinks the house out though.
1688 2018-12-26 20:38:50 I’m making my own beard oil for now on.
1689 2018-12-26 20:38:47 Anyone know where I can change my oil at ? Or is anyone down to do it I’ll pay you lol?
1690 2018-12-26 20:38:46 Baloney...the left has been advocating for carbon taxes and cap and trade for years. The right has been funding science denialism and FUD campaigns supported by big oil.
1691 2018-12-26 20:38:30 Lets not allow them fool us.....we know the secret already, the reason why they all hate PMB is because the past head of states and past presidents are the one with the rights to take crude oil overseas for refinery, and PMB withdrew it from them back 2 the govt
1692 2018-12-26 20:38:18 Oil Soars Most In 2 Years After Russian Reassurance, Stock Surge
 
Aided by the exuberant buying-panic in stocks and reassurances from Russia's energy minister, WTI prices are soaring (over 7%) today, breaking above $46.50 in its biggest daily jump since Dec 2016.
1693 2018-12-26 20:38:11 I do!
Successive Federal govermments have moved aerospace, phaema and IoT production / R&D to QC and all but give Ruperts Land to QC. They have hydro and shale oil. Buys a lot of self dependency particularly when the Sr bureaucrats deciding division of assets are Quebecois.
1694 2018-12-26 20:38:02 And we are the most foolish country that depend only on crude oil and forgetting we Nigeria is perfectly blessed with lots of mineral resources other countries envy us sometimes I ask myself why on it did we collect independent when we can’t manage God blessings for us
1695 2018-12-26 20:37:51 We changed the oil 2 days ago

1699 2018-12-26 20:37:20 Nice boobs...
1700 2018-12-26 20:36:50 So hot....baby
1701 2018-12-26 20:36:44 1. Sanders received 25% the oil $ of Beto if we're counting every person that works in industry.
2. Issue was "Did Sirota lie?" and the answer is "No" Folk have just been lying to protect their fave. 
3. This has been reported so poorly that you thought the pledge was PAC only.
1702 2018-12-26 20:36:27 Yes, General Clark is also a warcriminal and later did looting for his oil consult business. Not citing him as a hero or some whistleblower or clairvoyant
1703 2018-12-26 20:36:07 Hi, we have only been off rehearsal for 1 day and I miss you already. 

Looking forward to your green, blue, and pink group photos, videos, oil paintings, etc. 

Happy break! Please practice!
1704 2018-12-26 20:36:03 I left out buying pretty much anything.  Without Truck Drivers there would be no food, pharmaceuticals, oil or gas for your car, shoes, clothes, etc... the removal of a gender is just nonsensical.
1705 2018-12-26 20:35:59 I did

I don’t care how they got there..

They lost their tech... which relies on petroleum products 

So it’s a taste of oil free living
1706 2018-12-26 20:35:40 What do you mean by America? How about putting all the people of America first. I doubt that people are too worried about great trade deals, border walls, oil companies, wild military spending, tax cuts to wealthy. They just want a reasonably decent life in a safe  environment.
1707 2018-12-26 20:35:39 The last 3 families that owned my new place left because their marriage broke down....MOTHER WHERE IS THAT ANOINTING OIL!!!!
1708 2018-12-26 20:35:37 I believe Mr. Femi Otedola is “diversifying” into the refining sector. Oil is still a major frontier and Qatar’s OPEC exit (other counties expected to join) might cause panic (and possibly a boom).
1709 2018-12-26 20:35:36 Eat that pussy like olive oil, call it a gallery. Mr. Withdraws.
1710 2018-12-26 20:35:33 Massage ur feet with oil you will feel sleep try once
1711 2018-12-26 20:35:31 It’s going to change suddenly again. The weather is really erratic. Why governments don’t ban fossil fuels & bovine Agriculture is beyond me. Human beings need water more than they need meat, milk, internal combustion vehicles & coal& oil- generated electricity.

1724 2018-12-26 20:33:50 Wow, U.S. crude oil (WTI) up more than 9.5%, U.S. equity indexes exploding higher >3% (Nasdaq 100 up >4.7%) and U.S. Treasuries seeing selling pressure in longer tenors as the 2yr-5yr spread turns positive again.

1728 2018-12-26 20:33:33 Lol @pleasetryharder - now they’re all about the environment even though she had the most comprehensive and feasible plan to tackle climate change. 

I know who had a lot of connections to oil and fracking, it was the genius Jill Stein.

1745 2018-12-26 20:32:07 @CarolineRoseGiu its time for @AirForceColone1 to invade Methlahem for “oil”
1746 2018-12-26 20:32:05 Is it all keying off of oil?
1747 2018-12-26 20:32:03 when we were fighting the whaling 30 years ago, i think it was the oil that was most in demand.
1748 2018-12-26 20:32:00 RT @elonmusk: And, because electricity costs much less than gasoline, a Model 3 can cost about $1000 less per year to operate. Because it’s electric, there are no oil changes, smog checks, tuneups, fuel filter, or brake pad replacements.
1749 2018-12-26 20:31:54 Iraq is still restricting oil exports from its Kirkuk oil fields, which were seized a year ago from Peshmerga fighters that had occupied the area in the course of their war with ISIS.

1765 2018-12-26 20:30:04 I'm not 100% certain on how it works, so if I were to buy a Tesla I get a charging station for my home but if I needed to charge I'd have to rely on the networks around Canada?

1772 2018-12-26 20:29:45 Watching the price of oil this week has been an emotional roller coaster
1773 2018-12-26 20:29:40 Quantum of silliness? With the oil and water and the desert hotel?
1774 2018-12-26 20:29:35 Some of the oil money every year should be allocated to solar/wind or weatherization for poor and government buildings.
1775 2018-12-26 20:29:34 Garnier oil infused micellar water, Clinique take the day off oil, Alpha H liquid cleansing oil, Emma Hardie cleansing balm (my all time fave skincare product but you might need to double cleanse with this)

1777 2018-12-26 20:29:24 Black pill is vitamin D and yellow pill is fish oil right?
1778 2018-12-26 20:29:22 You need to look up why Tesla's and other electric vehicles are just as bad (if not worse). Lithium STRIP mines use SLAVE LABOR, often children. Lithium is a toxic pollutant, far more toxic than oil or gas.  Not to mention the fossil fuels used to generate the electric power.
1779 2018-12-26 20:29:20 That's it, and we all know the ruling of that in Islam! Let's just keep quiet about that issue for now.
1780 2018-12-26 20:29:19 Just got my cholesterol numbers, so I ate a bucket of oatmeal and half a bottle of fish oil caps. I'm good now, right?
1781 2018-12-26 20:29:17 All I plan to do until 6pm is lie in darkness watching Netflix, getting intoxicated by the smells from my delicious new oil diffuser 
1782 2018-12-26 20:29:10 THERE IS NO ANTIFLEA DOG SHAMPOO ESSENTIAL OIL
1783 2018-12-26 20:29:04 I would go into the local Napa store and buy an oil filter and the gal behind the counter would not question what kind of vehicle I owned...
1784 2018-12-26 20:29:02 Just bought an essential oil diffuser so if you catch me tomorrow being all rejuvenated, you know why  #selfcare
1785 2018-12-26 20:28:42 Back in the 1970s, the US adopted a maximum 55 mph speed limit to save gas during the Arab oil embargo. In the 1990’s, the 55 mph limit was eliminated. Fuel efficiency is much better at 55 mph. MUCH better.

1790 2018-12-26 20:27:57 The problem is how can one start praying for her
1791 2018-12-26 20:27:56 cut them in halves or quarters,  throw em in a bowl with a drizzle of olive oil, fresh minced garlic (very important), salt, pepper. Put them in the oven at 375 for 25 minutes or until crispy. Serve with a drizzle of balsamic glaze
1792 2018-12-26 20:27:52 Feliz Navidad !!!
1793 2018-12-26 20:27:50 #MeToo movement is dead. Nothing based on allegations without proof can survive. They're marching uphill on vegetable oil and have lost the ill-willed traction. Some truth most of it fiction.#MeanSpirited #FakeAllegations
1794 2018-12-26 20:27:44 Reminded me of that banned commercial for the palm oil with the baby orangutan and girl.
1795 2018-12-26 20:27:23 Yup, going to get that oil, just like he got the money for the wall from Mexico.
1796 2018-12-26 20:27:22 Even if we took resources out of it, we still wouldn't receive anything, and QB would receive almost the same (if not higher). This isn't about oil or hydro. This is about fiscal capacity and level of services. We have the tops in both. Why would you deny other CDN's the same?
1797 2018-12-26 20:27:17 Crude oil is also a good short
1798 2018-12-26 20:27:14 He was trying to turn an oil rig around.
1799 2018-12-26 20:27:04 I’ve been using bio oil which is good so far. I just bought some tummy butter tho! Thanks!!
1800 2018-12-26 20:26:59 Merry Christmas!  True spirit of the holiday’s.  We anonymously paid a families heating oil bill so it would not be shut off.  The mother was dying from cancer.  My children wondered why we didn’t tell anyone...I told them we call it quietly answering prayers.
1801 2018-12-26 20:26:55 Snake oil salesman.
1802 2018-12-26 20:26:43 "In another sign of a rapprochement with the U.S., Cavusoglu said Halkbank’s former head of international banking, Hakan Atilla, who was convicted by a U.S. court in January for helping Iran evade sanctions on billions of dollars of oil revenue, may be freed to return home."
1803 2018-12-26 20:26:28 "Rojava just doesn't really want oil period"

it's like a drug.
1804 2018-12-26 20:26:24 Haka Allah ya tsara, you can't do anything sir.
1805 2018-12-26 20:26:11 How do they pay for their welfare system? By mean selling oil? How capitalist of them.
1806 2018-12-26 20:26:05 It was because of the oil boom. Chavez destroyed the economy by increasing the public spending massively and expropiation. After the boom, Venezuela hit the crisis.....The Americans have nothing to do with it. Wow! The ignorance
1807 2018-12-26 20:25:48 I love that motor oil! So good and quite the punch!
1808 2018-12-26 20:25:45 Oil change alone $1,500?  Tough times.  Thank gawd for that tax payer subsidy to get those costs down!
1809 2018-12-26 20:25:30 Humidifier just put some water in and Olbas oil ,
1810 2018-12-26 20:25:15 Buhari's relatives who begged for 2k pre-2015 elections became billionaires and owners of mansions from our oil money, why Nigeria and Nigerians languished in recession, extreme poverty. See why Nigeria went into recession the instant buhari and cronies took over government?

1813 2018-12-26 20:24:52 I lived in Odessa, TX. I could never figure out why gas was more expensive where the source of oil was. Oh well bots booming now. Huge oil deposits are way beyond measure!!  No more slavery to OPEC!!  America is energy independent!!
1814 2018-12-26 20:24:43 Turkey and Israel both operation international oil companies that sell primarily to the US

Syria runs oil companies that mostly sell to Russia and China

Rojava just doesn't really want oil period
1815 2018-12-26 20:24:42 Everytime I come get an oil change, the nigga mention how my car smell like weed. Like stfu.
1816 2018-12-26 20:24:27 In a burst of post-holiday productivity I have paid all my bills, did all the laundry, cleaned the house, and even took my car to have the oil changed (as soon as the oil-change light came on even... amazing!) Have no idea what to do with myself for the next 7 days that I'm off.
1817 2018-12-26 20:24:21 Well this has justified the reason for this cooked up post, may Allah forgive you.

1821 2018-12-26 20:23:58 Hahaha by now the cooking oil may be boiling on the stove 
1822 2018-12-26 20:23:57 I usually eat 3 meals.  Espresso plus 4 eggs and 2 strips of bacon or steak and eggs for breakfast. 
 
Lunch and dinner are generally fairly fatty protein ( salmon or beef) plus a spinach salad with avocado and olive oil salt and pepper. 

Carbs with a meal when I feel like it.
1823 2018-12-26 20:23:52 he never wanted the oil. that was the previous administration and the war hawks and the kurds.
1824 2018-12-26 20:23:52 Has anyone tried CBD oil? Thoughts on it?
1825 2018-12-26 20:23:45 I need his motor oil cum to get me pregnant
1826 2018-12-26 20:23:32 I find that the typical sedan will average about 10L per 100km or 10km per litre. At $1.40 per litre the vehicle will burn 14 cents of fuel per km. Tesla M3 will average 1.5c per km at 10c/kwh, or about the cost of an oil change. Running the M3 is dirt cheap.
1827 2018-12-26 20:23:29 Oil and silver both up :)
1828 2018-12-26 20:23:21 Your trying to portray the Middle East as some shining beacon of how to run a oil business .
1829 2018-12-26 20:23:00 I’m going to have to burn the midnight oil in order to get shit done 2019. I love my sleep but I’m going to have to sacrifice a couple of hours of it

1834 2018-12-26 20:22:36 so if it was about „grabbing“ the oil, why does Trump suddenly run away now, leaving all that oil behind?

1842 2018-12-26 20:22:14 So beautiful....
1843 2018-12-26 20:21:48 I don’t really give the govt the benefit of the doubt to use those funds wisely. Our price differential is due to the monopsony w/ the US our Canadian oil industry faces b/c we lack transport capacity to tidewater to sell to alternative markets.

Im not sure if JA is putting a stop to these areas? only exploration?
Aussie by contrast imports over 90% of fuel product requirements
1846 2018-12-26 20:21:37 Hi
1847 2018-12-26 20:21:35 It depends. A lot of additives and processes really are bad e.g. palm oil used as cheap fats in everything from soap to pastry. Other processed foods e.g. frozen peas are vastly better than fresh. People are too lazy to learn the difference is the main issue.
1848 2018-12-26 20:21:31 The problem was Oil Company & industry grabs, much like BEE.
1849 2018-12-26 20:21:26 Note it says ‘new’. Probably hasn’t found any more oil to harvest. What do all of you intend doing when we go back to the cave man era. Give up your iPads. iPhones, cars etc and live off green leaves? So amusing to read your virtue signalling.

1851 2018-12-26 20:20:59 donald trump is in iraq. watch your purses and your oil tanks.
1852 2018-12-26 20:20:43 Nigeria is a sovereign state that has the power to print paper & give it whatever value she likes. It is this paper we spend as naira

The paper printed by the US is the global store of value. So when we sell our oil we get US paper. We keep the US paper & share our own paper
1853 2018-12-26 20:20:38 It depends how it is measured. If you go by GDP, the UK has the fifth largest economy in the world. Going by GNI, oil wealth tends to dominate, so the UK isn't even in the top 25. That's probably because the economy is service-dominated, and so not particularly diverse.
1854 2018-12-26 20:20:36 Less than 6 months ago, another lady too committed suicide. ABU Engineering. It was a very tragic news. She was calm, humble and among the best students.

1856 2018-12-26 20:20:33 & the rue is the oil & flour?
1857 2018-12-26 20:20:32 You are absolutely correct, Ibs. Pragmatism, skepticism and cynicism are pervasive today and will become even more so in the future. 
It’s all about small and demonstrable steps - eg Iceland and the orangutan: they made it clear they no longer used palm oil. They proved it.
1858 2018-12-26 20:20:11 Wind turbines kill countless wildlife, yet leftists and tree huggers ignore that fact. No one is saying we should ONLY oil, Natural Gas or coal. Just as PETA needs to realize that some animals are for consumption=use what's available.

1861 2018-12-26 20:19:45 not alaskan, but my family is of fishermen and oystermen of WA. i miss smoked sturgeon preserved in oil and canned.. and also the winter freezer full of elk.
1862 2018-12-26 20:19:41 A snake oil salesmen. Don't insult regular salesmen.
1863 2018-12-26 20:19:35 Right. And is there anything comparatively less useful than initiating the massive collapse of infrastructure, agricultural systems and societies? That's what makes oil, gas, and coal obsolete. The more useful technologies - wind, solar, geothermal, tidal - are already here.
1864 2018-12-26 20:19:32 No, that Beto is the wrong candidate. A neolib that will do Wall Streets bidding and continue vote with republicans to tear down the ACA and take money from oil companies.

1868 2018-12-26 20:19:05 Ive had no luck with melatonin, dont sleep well do to pain and severe muscle spasms with sharp pain. Been doing a bit better with CBD oil. Its helping almost more than my regular medications. Not sure if you have tried it yet, but my BF even likes the CBD gummies.
1869 2018-12-26 20:19:03 Once a pore becomes clogged, it traps skin oil inside. Bacteria grows in this oil and can cause an inflammatory response in the skin.

1873 2018-12-26 20:18:39 If @nassnigeria truly loves this country, they shd reduce the price per barrel in the budget since they increased it last year. However, they shd reduce the recurrent expenditure & their own allocation to accommodate the reduction in the price of oil.

1887 2018-12-26 20:16:13 Yeah, seems like a great idea. PHEVs periodically start the engine to circulate and heat the engine oil, as well as burn the fuel from the tank to prevent it from going stale. 

Occasionally I’ll pop my car into Neutral when coming a stop, so it only uses the friction brakes.

1893 2018-12-26 20:15:13 In the perfume industry people bitch about ‘synthetic scents’ because ‘chemicals cause allergies’ and it’s like synthetic rose scent is a single non-reactive molecule?

1894 2018-12-26 20:15:07 Yet another example of how easy it is manipulate feeble minds. BTW, who put oil on the floor? This dude couldn't keep his feet from sliding.

Because when I last got my oil change, they looked at me like I was stupid when I didn't choose the right pull. 
1898 2018-12-26 20:14:56 This rando on Snapchat just messaged me “I wanna give you a baby oil massage.” Big Yikes on that thanks.
1899 2018-12-26 20:14:56 It's true. Sweetwater Texas is nothing but turbines now. Why we try to pretend like we're the wild west oil barons is beyond me.
1900 2018-12-26 20:14:54 Can you people get a friggin life. Leave the man alone. Do you have people burning the midnight oil constantly looking for shit on Trump? Is that to make sour puss Hillary feel better? "Fred Trump"

1908 2018-12-26 20:14:24 SDF betrayed syria by letting USA grab the oil. thats when they overplayed their hand and thats why they will lose everything now. except some autonomy.
1909 2018-12-26 20:14:24 Sure. But by the metric Sirota is running with, isn’t Perry the stronger candidate? If Sirota truly cares about this issue, shouldn’t he amend his reporting to show that Bernie also took a lot of oil and gas money- even more than Rick Perry- and is not as good a dancer as Perry.
1910 2018-12-26 20:14:23 Told you about that oil 
1911 2018-12-26 20:14:05 Hey beautiful
1912 2018-12-26 20:14:05 Should I spent 80 dollars on a cleanser and a facial oil.
1913 2018-12-26 20:13:56  ... black gold to be sure, that’s some expensive oil
1914 2018-12-26 20:13:56 I’d only put light oil in if the bulbs are dim bud 
1915 2018-12-26 20:13:55 OW! OW! OW! NO BITING! Oil is true, then we all out of you.
1916 2018-12-26 20:13:52 He went to explore business opportunities there. You know what i mean . oil  etc .... as they didn’t find Nukes and chemical weapons . Still I don’t understand the reason of invading iraq .
1917 2018-12-26 20:13:47 I know nowt about designing warships but structural steel weight & more space are cheap(ish) things to buy for complex marine structures like oil & gas platforms and floating systems. 

Plant & systems are the high cost items - steel is cheap.
1918 2018-12-26 20:13:39 I make up my marinades and recipes as I go along, always have. I tend to use soy sauce, olive oil, lemon/lime juice, Apple Cider Vinegar as a liquid base, then turmeric, smoked paprika, salt/pepper, pup fluff mixed in, adding coriander, ginger, stock etc as it's cooked.
1919 2018-12-26 20:13:36 Hey you are so beautiful

1938 2018-12-26 20:11:34 Hey - wake up and smell the liniment oil!  We 50-somethings are still young.  40 years from now, if my sons stick me in a nursing home (they’d better not!), I’m going to rock out every doggone day with George Thorogood’s “Bad to the Bone” (LOUD!) and refuse all my meds!
1939 2018-12-26 20:11:31 Meanwhile, in Toronto, they’ve made downtown parking free for the holidays! FFS. Everybody drive! Please think of the oil companies.
1940 2018-12-26 20:11:27 What stupid oil. U still have a dreg mentality in this age and time.
1941 2018-12-26 20:11:24 Global oil prices jumped the most in two years on Wednesday. Brent crude rose by US$4.00 or 7.9% to US$54.47 a barrel and the US Nymex price rose by $3.69 or 8.7% to US$46.22 a barrel.

1943 2018-12-26 20:11:14 The sad irony for Canadians is that Canada exports large quantities of their oil to the US and you guys pay more than double than what we pay. And that’s factoring in the foreign exchange discount!
1944 2018-12-26 20:11:09 Senator, you and the right favor Big Oil and Coal socialism, so let’s drop the name-calling, shall we?  Global warming has gotten worse directly as a result of your dereliction of duty.  If you’re willing to come to the table now however and work on a solution, then let’s go.
1945 2018-12-26 20:10:49 Why do you start ridiculous “ clubs” and add strangers to them?

It’s creepy.. and suggests you need therapy

I guarantee any number for oil clean up you come up with is as wrong as the voices in your head 
1946 2018-12-26 20:10:45 Ok boys serious question.. how long can you drive with your “change engine oil soon” light on?

1948 2018-12-26 20:10:36 my prob is remembering to move the toiletry bag to my purse for the workday- a thing of rosehip oil makes an ASTONISHING mess after a day in the car trunk, even from inside a ziplock!
1949 2018-12-26 20:10:36 It was really simple .
Olive oil heated in the pan ,  then add fresh garlic, butter ,oregano , lemon juice , white wine, sea salt & pepper. After Patting the scallops dry , season with basil & Cook in the heated sauce 2-3 min. And done.
1950 2018-12-26 20:10:31 NZ has quite vast Oil/Gas reserves actually (untapped)
They are currently 35% self sufficient
1951 2018-12-26 20:10:29 Really decent article. If you know a manual wheelchair user, one of the nicest things you could ever do for them is remove the hair from their caster bearings. It draws all the oil from the bearings and causes them to seize up.
1952 2018-12-26 20:10:21 So happy to be home from work. Got gas for $1.69/gal. Now if only all the oil change places weren't so busy.

1966 2018-12-26 20:08:50 It’s not in the A besides oil form 
1967 2018-12-26 20:08:43 Can it take care of oil spillage pollution?
1968 2018-12-26 20:08:41 Most voters sure are.

Candidates are certainly fewer and far between. Unless you expect someone awash in oil and gas industry donations to seriously regulate carbon emissions to necessary levels. In which case, you’re far too naive for American politics.
1969 2018-12-26 20:08:33 I just tasted olive oil poured over a dark chocolate truffle and my eyes have been opened and this is the next big thing (ok, people from Spain, be quiet, eh).
1970 2018-12-26 20:08:03 I use Trader Joe’s jojoba oil! it’s about $7 but it lasts FOREVER ‘cause a little goes a really long way.
1971 2018-12-26 20:08:00 A Yaris - 6.1L/100km. Prius and Camry hybrids (family members drive them) get a bit better, 5.5 or less. I guess if you include oil change and brake wear, my cost is closer to $700/10000km
1972 2018-12-26 20:08:00 Dow flying oil soaring ok fro na low base but soaring. Will it last who knows but day trades to be had tomorrow for sure.
1973 2018-12-26 20:07:56 On another note. Just bought some CBD oil on the interwebs. Can't believe it's illegal in Texas.
1974 2018-12-26 20:07:50 Apparently you didnt get the sarcasm.
I didnt agree, and besides making very little money, I got tired of having to do it to survive. I quit industry disgusted at what it had become, how it had been destroyed by government inaction on what was promised in 86
1975 2018-12-26 20:07:41 That’s because of the incompetence of Westminster government ya tube.Norway still takes in billions from oil revenues.Thatcher sold the states oil company unlike the competent government in Norway.
1976 2018-12-26 20:07:37 Plus fission fuel is hardly rare, particularly if we start breeding from natural U or thorium. An average cubic meter of Earth’s crust has much more energy in breedable fissionables (U and Th) than the equivalent cubic meter of coal or oil has chemical energy.
1977 2018-12-26 20:07:32 Last night I started using Josie Maran argon oil treatment and my skin has such a beautiful glow that I can’t stop looking at myself anytime I pass a mirror. 
1978 2018-12-26 20:07:26 I hope your soy bean farmers can hang on and your dairy farmers.  Something US doesn’t  reqliaze is that others can fill the gap.  We can supply oil, soybeans, milk to China.
1979 2018-12-26 20:07:18 The day after Christmas makes me sad but getting mansplained about an oil change on my car is the real bummer today 
1980 2018-12-26 20:07:12 So if there was no oil industry in Russia, it wouldn't cause any hardship to average Russians. That is quite the hot take.
1981 2018-12-26 20:07:06 And he’d better get the damn oil while he’s there. 
1982 2018-12-26 20:07:00 ooh, I use grapeseed oil in my oil mix  i’ll have to try that out for this too. thank ya!
1983 2018-12-26 20:06:55 Can't expect an administration staffed by the sitting president of a private oil company to care too much about human rights now can we.

What's "Resistance" press excuse for not covering the Trump-Genie Energy scandal?

Has everyone in the press been bought off?
1984 2018-12-26 20:06:51 The term wet needs a solid and a liquid to be used. You can’t pour water in oil and say the oil is wet but you can do that with a towel. So yeah yeah water has more water “Surrounding” it but not “Touching it” so water literally can’t be wet 
1985 2018-12-26 20:06:50 Crude oil was up close to 9% today.

Knew cheap gas wouldn’t be around forever.

Damn it.
1986 2018-12-26 20:06:50 Word around the office is you've got a bat with huge nut. I've got a bat with huge nut too. Maybe our bats should rub their huge nut together?Maybe a little oil?
1987 2018-12-26 20:06:33 It’s kind of scary that I can get the marketing data fed to my agency live of anyone that has visited an auto dealer or oil change place in the last 24 hours and run retargeting ads them...
1988 2018-12-26 20:06:25 Ideologically similar to the LGBTQ people who spew anti-Israel hate. Makes NO sense.
But there IS some logic to the oil issue: Trudeau IS on video saying, "I love Islam";  but has he ever made a similar claim about Alberta (or even Canada)? (Answer: No.)
1989 2018-12-26 20:06:24 Noise trading both ways. Ex-post rationalizations like "stock market signals forthcoming recession". Truth: traders/algo imitating one another, herding, technical trading, misinterpretation of intermarkets (for instance oil down for reasons unlinked to state of world economy)
1990 2018-12-26 20:06:23 Cycling single = 15 minutes prep, 3.5 hour cycle, 15 minutes to clean and oil bike.

1996 2018-12-26 20:05:27 I’m convinced that ppl are putting actual oil on their face to create the glowing skin look before you take a selfie.. but carry on
1997 2018-12-26 20:05:23 LOL the sheer desperation in these tweets, not content with inventing entire histories & twisting narratives, you resort to nitpicking on bureaucratic mishaps (that happen the world over)... but is this really a bigger scandal than say, OIL & GAS rich Algeria having an outbreak
1998 2018-12-26 20:05:14 idk if your skin is sensitive or not, but i use grapeseed oil at night, after i’ve washed my face but before i put my moisturizer on. also try exfoliating 1-2 times a week.
1999 2018-12-26 20:05:14 So how does big oil mask its supposed payments to Heartland, and why do they feel the need to do so?
2000 2018-12-26 20:05:05 Many are there because their friends put them there. Big oil, big retail, big etc. You know the swamp, the one that should be drained. The same swamp that trump is part of, where all his rich friends are

2003 2018-12-26 20:04:16 Why would a "Mediterranean diet" include Canola oil?

That makes zero fucking sense.
2004 2018-12-26 20:04:14 @erinleecarr in your research for Dirty Money, did you consider Essential Oil MLMs? There are so many crazy stories about Young Living and doTERRA at the intersection of Dirty Money/Going Clear vibes, seems like a natural fit.

2014 2018-12-26 20:02:27 You're mistaken, part of that pledge was against taking more than 200 dollars from oil industry executives, PAC, or "fronts". He took about 30,000 dollars of donations larger than 200 from people listed in that group.
2015 2018-12-26 20:02:27 Inflation was getting out of hand in 2007 and 2008. Look at oil and commodity prices. They were bubbling. The FED freaked out and raised interest rates too much, which caused liquidity to dry up which caused the 2008 crisis.
2016 2018-12-26 20:02:19 We are playing some horrible football. What is just wrong?
2017 2018-12-26 20:02:11 Interest Rate is increasing... Petroleum oil is decreasing.. Gold increase (the heaven)

2019 2018-12-26 20:02:09 Funny, #China makes business all over the world, with the means of debts. However they do not accept dumb bonds, but infrastructure, oil, minerals, food products, etc. Very clever! Superior strategy
2020 2018-12-26 20:01:43 You should be very well aware that Alberta depends on the gas and oil industry and if it is not developed then everyone pays more taxes on our backs, you should smarten up maybe
2021 2018-12-26 20:01:40 @Avis rented a car to me with no oil in it and it shut itself off in middle of the night, driving down the freeway, 19° and no cell service. They refuse to give me a refund. It amazes me that they think a 30% discount makes up for their negligence. Safety means nothing.

2049 2018-12-26 19:58:58 I *really* enjoy little checkbox around-the-house stuff. I’ve gotten a ton done today. Recycling, changing lightbulbs, tightening screws, changing oil, fixing nails in tires, updating firmware, glueing stuff. So much done.
2050 2018-12-26 19:58:50 Yeah good points for sure thank you. Also I don't think it's a coincidence that both ppl get most from oil are in um TEXAS
2051 2018-12-26 19:58:49 Yeah, it's should just be chopped with enough oil added to loosen the mixture. 
When I'm still around next year and can face having guests health-wise again I might do a rib. One of the local butchers has a salt aging room now and they should off some impressive cuts.
2052 2018-12-26 19:58:40 Not to mention these whale fisherman have their own traditions too. None of this matters cuz we, US, is not in need of whale oil nor is it profitable anymore so we bring out our "morality" police to take our attention away from the real atrocities WE commit at home/overseas
2053 2018-12-26 19:58:35 animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
2054 2018-12-26 19:58:35 Got my oil change lol I feel better
2055 2018-12-26 19:58:26 That is what we praying for. For me oil is noting. China, India, Spain, Japan and many more doesn't have oil and they are far better than Nigeria. Don't deceived your self by thinking oil is only source of life.
2056 2018-12-26 19:58:01 There’s an issue with the oil filter housing in my car that’s causing a leak, so I won’t be able to attend WNF tonight.

That said, I’ve plans for UMvC3 at some point in the near future.
2057 2018-12-26 19:57:51 Surprised to see this in Globe - rarely even mention climate change implications in their extensive coverage of the oil and gas industry
2058 2018-12-26 19:57:43 Pass this guy the baby oil LMAO

2061 2018-12-26 19:57:40 There was nothing miss leading about it at all. From immigration,  to deregulation, to oil and gas,  Beto has voted with Trump and against the majority of Democrats.

2065 2018-12-26 19:57:31 So disheartening when I saw d news, a guy was even telling me they met at North gate on Monday.
2066 2018-12-26 19:57:08 Still defending them oil reserves??
2067 2018-12-26 19:57:05 Cut them in half, spray them with olive oil lightly and season well.
Crisp them reasonably in a high temp oven (I use a toaster oven) and they come out more like crispy snack treats while retaining all the flatulent benefits to make Christmas extra special.

She hummed to herself while she was cooking. She really did enjoy this.
2076 2018-12-26 19:55:28 nah i'm using my usual dr. pepper 'broth' this time. had the chicken soak in spices and oil all night in the fridge tho
2077 2018-12-26 19:55:24 Idk who needs this reminder but go get your oil changed
2078 2018-12-26 19:55:17 Syria operates oil companies that ship to China and Russia primarily, Turkey runs oil companies that ship to europe and the US, as does Israel.

While yes all these regimes are run by dictators, all are also selfish and greedy

2081 2018-12-26 19:54:39 People are dying and politicians argue over a check from Mexico and fence vs wall.
No matter what position you take we should all agree politicians are worthless self promoting parasites.
2082 2018-12-26 19:54:38 She glanced over at the bowl he was pointing at, a big smile forming on her face. "Great job Denki!"

She was so proud of him. She taught him well. 

"Now you just need to cook them!" Once she finished making the batter, she poured a bit of oil in the pan and then the batter. +

2085 2018-12-26 19:54:25 Trump called the bottom. Be careful. He took oil down successfully and can take the market higher too just by telling his followers to keep buying the dip. He knows he's going to call another truce with China to boost the market.

2088 2018-12-26 19:53:59 Are you trying to attack the Scottish Government's record on finance with your dim witted response. Tell me again, how is it we've no oil fund, and Norway has over, US$1 trillion in assets. Wouldn't that be down to your precious past and present Westminster Governments? #indyref2

2094 2018-12-26 19:53:22 John, you steaming pile of Texas bullsh••.

The coal, oil and natural gas industries have been externalizing and concealing the damages caused by their profit-making and NOW your answer is to TAX the PEOPLE who SUBSIDIZE these industries and their climate destroying profits?

2100 2018-12-26 19:52:42 You can? I don’t see a cat in hells chance when they’re bankrolled by companies interested in oil & so on. To accept a status quo candidate is to accept the current mess. Sanders is the most popular candidate. Sanders isn’t wholly socialist either, many moderate aspects.
2101 2018-12-26 19:52:41 Amazing how much difference the most basic service makes to a car. A Clean MAF, fresh oil and a good italian tune makes life so much better.
2102 2018-12-26 19:52:38 That tanker ban affects a small part of the coast. It's also a ban on supertankers, not small ones carrying sweet oil. The policy to exclude supertankers has been in effect for 20 yrs. That was one reason why Gateway failed at Kitimat. Even Prentice knew Kitimat was out as a port
2103 2018-12-26 19:52:26 Y el brillo en ellos  parece que se bañaron en baby oil hahhaahahahaahaha
2104 2018-12-26 19:52:17 It has a bit of oil, but bear in mind the drive unit has very few moving parts so there’s far less need for lubrication compared to gas cars’ hundreds of moving parts.
2105 2018-12-26 19:52:15 "if taken seriously" Buddy the topic of discussion is Beto, one many dems who have voted with Trump on immigration,  deregulation,  and oil and gas expansion,  nobody is more effective at advancing Trump policies,  than DLC Third Way "New Democrats" like Beto.

2109 2018-12-26 19:51:53 Main thing is washing/conditioning with a good product and putting in something to help it grow thick and soft. The butter and oil is good
2110 2018-12-26 19:51:50 Did specific fossil fuel companies donate to him or individuals that work in oil companies? He was running in Texas where many many people work for oil companies. If they were donations from individuals how did he break the pledge?
2111 2018-12-26 19:51:49 تمام احباب اگر توفیق ہو اور میسر ہو تو extra virgin olive oil (first cold press) استعمال کریں نہایت مفید ہے
2112 2018-12-26 19:51:45 The criticism of Beto taking oil money over 200 is that it goes against a pledge he signed. A pledge that wasn't even launched until 2017. There is no way you can get on Sanders for breaking a pledge he never signed because at the time he ran, 2016, it hadn't even been written.
2113 2018-12-26 19:51:44 What policies do you have to end austerity in the wake of Brexit? 
NHS and Social Care pressures just need to be given funding and everything will be fine. How much and where from?
You haven't got the answer -  you're becoming the socialist equivalent of a snake oil salesman.
2114 2018-12-26 19:51:37 I understand your perspective but I would disagree. Syria has been pretty cordial with the SDF for the last year. Prior to that I would agree with you but recently I think Assad realises that so long as he gets his oil, the territory isn't actually valuable to him

2128 2018-12-26 19:49:46 In this situation, soak it with oil (any type) the glue will become effect-less
2129 2018-12-26 19:49:45 He's still working on a plan to get all of Iraq's oil wells for US companies - which he has mentioned before.

Also, brake fluid will still need changing every 2 years because it's hygroscopic.

2143 2018-12-26 19:48:20 Not saying that at all. He's still is the #2 recepient of oil money in the US, and has not stuck fully to the pledge he took. This isn't a slander on Beto because I really like the guy, but he receives money from executives in oil and gas. It's about industry, not individuals.
2144 2018-12-26 19:48:20 My dad has been getting CBD oil in his açaí bowls at the raw food place and not telling my mom because he thinks it does something.
2145 2018-12-26 19:48:03 Oil drops to $50 pet barrel, pls how much are we expecting to fund our 2019 budget sef?
2146 2018-12-26 19:47:57 The SDF are smart, they know what they're doing. They know exactly how to keep Syria happy.

Syria doesn't want to deal with secular Kurds with a desire for independence, thus the territory is only useful in their eyes for oil, oil the Kurds don't want and are offering them.
2147 2018-12-26 19:47:40 Lotsa garlic oil
2148 2018-12-26 19:47:39 i know y’all know this but coconut oil should not be the only thing u put on ur skin and should never be used on ur face 
2149 2018-12-26 19:47:37 If we refuse to accept science then where do we get our proof? Politicians? Twitter? Oil barons?
2150 2018-12-26 19:47:32 Love to use coconut milk in my curries and in my soup maker , shame it’s liquid or I’d put it on my hair , I’ll keep my coconut oil for that

2153 2018-12-26 19:47:08 @WilliamsRuto In 2011, my advice to then VP Kalonzo Musyoka, in a WIPER forum, was that our history of succession politics is laden with treachery especially for the number twos. Uhuru is cutting you to size. He is practicing Moism and trying to out-Herod Herod.
2154 2018-12-26 19:47:04 @GasBuddyDan CAD loss was largest in 9 months. Drop in oil prices, idea Bank of Canada is pausing its rate cycle, poor economic data (deterioration in senior loan officer survey, soft CPI figures, less portfolio capital inflows) & risk-off sentiment the main drivers. #cdnecon
2155 2018-12-26 19:47:03 I know! My cousin works in the oil rigs out there and dude makes bank!! He has a lifted Cummins and a Shelby GT500 I’m like fuck goals lol
2156 2018-12-26 19:47:03 Look around at all the other countries using innovative new technologies to harness carbon friendlier energy sources. Too bad big oil has their hands so deep in GOP pockets... we too could be on this frontier. Smh
2157 2018-12-26 19:47:03 $cei  8.68% oil ^^^^^^^^^^
2158 2018-12-26 19:47:02 I’ve seen him tweeting...

He sounds like an old man who yells at clouds..

I pretty much ignore him

But when I saw him posting $260 billion clean up as a fact

Had to disabuse him of his superior Alberta oil knowledge 
2159 2018-12-26 19:47:00 I bought an oil diffuser/humidifier. Along with it, I bought a few oils that are scented after Disney parks. I purposefully bought a scent that smells like the water in Pirates of the Caribbean.
2160 2018-12-26 19:46:58 have you tried jojoba oil? I rub a few drops in at night and wake up with soft, shiny skin.
2161 2018-12-26 19:46:44 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...
2162 2018-12-26 19:46:37 That is the main reason why the stock market went so low, there are other reasons. But for the most part you can tell when the stock market is going to go up or down by looking at the price of barrels of oil! So I don’t see how I’m the moron.
2163 2018-12-26 19:46:32 trumps doing show support to keep oil in favor of him a middle man they jus in cluster fuk./

2174 2018-12-26 19:45:49 Would you care to tell readers here how much TOTAL oil revenues were?  Then would you care to tell readers the total oil revenue from Norway for the same period?

While your at it, maybe you could discuss why Ireland, with less people and no oil had higher tax revenue than Sco?
2175 2018-12-26 19:45:46 Stir together 2 1/2 pints bacon with 4 cups yogurt. Mix in Olive Oil. Chill.  Serve on a bed of pasta

2178 2018-12-26 19:45:35  Looks like I need to take a deeper dive into these products.. I just been mixing the beard butter & oil
2179 2018-12-26 19:45:30 Stocks are bouncing today because they were heavily oversold. Also, oil is printing a powerful bounce, currently up over 9%. Oil is rising after a report that there will be more xmas returns than ever this year. That is a boon for transports, thus an increase in oil demand.
2180 2018-12-26 19:45:18 I think you will love these. So tasty and so easy to make. I need gluten-free as well as oil free. So hard to find. Corn is too tough.
2181 2018-12-26 19:45:17 #PollutionPOTUS

RT @nytimes: After protests from the oil industry, the Trump administration repealed limits on methane flaring and leaks on federal and Indian lands, a practice that creates pollutants that can cause respiratory problems and thE carcinogenic chemicals.

2183 2018-12-26 19:45:14 Wallahi we do talk but she's never disclosed or shown any sign, she even encourage me on my low  what could hv gone wrong, suicide ain't an option.
2184 2018-12-26 19:45:00 Stocks and oil prices rebound. Strong x-mas season sales!
2185 2018-12-26 19:44:52 I suffer from cluster headaches/migraines almost daily too. What I’ve found helps is anything with peppermint oil, that I rub on my temple. In under 10 minutes I can feel the headaches breaking up
2186 2018-12-26 19:44:50 1970’s were a different world...      

No (inflation killing) internet and an America dependent upon OPEC inflating oil prices.
2187 2018-12-26 19:44:41 you are hurting i know, apply some oil
2188 2018-12-26 19:44:37 I want to buy one not immediately but definitelyWe produce electricity here in Bhutan and oil is expensive.
2189 2018-12-26 19:44:10 So the guys who LITERALLY wrote the "no oil&gas money" pledge says Beto, who had signed the pledge, broke it, didn't respond when questioned, and therefore, removed from it.

And that's what David Sirota reported.

And yet you are still trying to argue the actual facts.

Amazing.
2190 2018-12-26 19:43:45 hear me saudi prince i was there help ending all of them dictators and your oil price sure looking good./
2191 2018-12-26 19:43:41 All money in the U.S. is oil money.
2192 2018-12-26 19:43:40 Imprison the fossil FOOLS who lied for years about our changing climate so they could extract the last bit of oil from the melted Arctic and ship it cheaper across the world  .   OR send em to MARS.

2194 2018-12-26 19:43:38 "He took a pledge to not take money from oil and gas executives, and he broke that pledge. The people who sign politicians to that pledge said he broke it." Cite me that pledge of his you say he's broken. And cite me "the people who sign politicians to that pledge."
2195 2018-12-26 19:43:31 Remember that putz Jimmy Carter with his loose money fed?  It was awful. Nobody could buy/sell a house after high inflation and 20% mortgages.   The fed is hurting the stock market but inflation is worse.  Cheap oil is  helping keep  inflation low but oil won't stay low forever.
2196 2018-12-26 19:43:28 Crude oil... 9% up. Told you clearly that $42---$38 will act as major support. 

Took reversal today... Initial upside target intact  $52
2197 2018-12-26 19:43:10 I do it all. FUD, not-funny jokes, what-aboutisms. I'm short Tesla and long various oil stocks, but that doesn't mean Tesla isn't a fraud.
2198 2018-12-26 19:43:10 
I remembered the day someone told my mum they saw cat in our compound. That night we held vigil and poured anointing oil round the house.
2199 2018-12-26 19:43:08 Yeah man that’s what birthday buddies are for. We have each other’s backs and lottery numbers. I was gonna get an oil change but was too busy so I made an appointment for 1:30pm tomorrow.

2202 2018-12-26 19:42:46 "David Turnbull, strategic communications director at Oil Change USA, told Sludge on Tuesday that the group had just removed O’Rourke’s name from the list of signers."
2203 2018-12-26 19:42:43 Try baby oil then WD40 and if that’s not working nail polish remover BUT it’s gonna smear the pink so maybe have a design in mind. 
2204 2018-12-26 19:42:37 California has a buttload of oil refineries all up and down the coast. Prices should be great there, apart from state taxes.
2205 2018-12-26 19:42:37 All of you are despicable humans. Using migrants and American ppl as pawns in your political chess game. I despise every one of you and your political talking points. 
Real ppl are affected while you prattle on over who will pay and semantics of wall vs fence
2206 2018-12-26 19:42:33 nigeria oil up, yes
2207 2018-12-26 19:42:28 Crude oil... 9% up. Told you clearly that $42---$38 will act as major support. 

Took reversal today... Initial upside target intact  $52
2208 2018-12-26 19:42:27 "Oil Change USA, which led a coalition of environmental and democracy organizations to create the No Fossil Fuel Money Pledge, attempted to reach O’Rourke’s campaign and congressional office but did not hear back"
2209 2018-12-26 19:42:02 @AAA_Arizona any idea why Arizona gas prices are high? They seem awfully high compared to where Oil is trading at.  My dad just filled up for $1.67 in Missouri.
2210 2018-12-26 19:41:54 Just changed my oil by myself I feel accomplished
2211 2018-12-26 19:41:41 Please go ahead.

2214 2018-12-26 19:41:30 I wrote it after reading her tragic suicide note. I felt so sad. For one on the cusp of liberation to end so abruptly in pain and loneliness, even a heart hewn from stone, would quiver and weep. I pray she finds the peace she was denied. Really sad.
2215 2018-12-26 19:41:24 You stole my lamp oil AND my rupees!
Bombs is all i have!
2216 2018-12-26 19:41:17 2700$ EACH, by 30 people, who are OIL AND GAS EXECUTIVES.

He took a pledge to not take money from oil and gas executives, and he broke that pledge. The people who sign politicians to that pledge said he broke it.

I have no idea why you keep arguing in the face of facts
2217 2018-12-26 19:41:12 Can’t stand the taste or smell of it. Mustard oil is okay
2218 2018-12-26 19:41:08 Nagpapamiss lang ako sa team oil. HAHAHAHAHAHAHA char.
2219 2018-12-26 19:41:00 Wednesday Update: #Crude oil continually climbs over 8.47% from 42.543 to 46.200, covering yesterday’s loss.
2220 2018-12-26 19:40:56 $ECA bounces today after it peaked at $14/share due to crude oil price crashed
2221 2018-12-26 19:40:55 sad sad lives, uneducated and blinkered. Just remember when the world runs out of oil and  we can't make plastic and nylon the vegans will all be naked 
2222 2018-12-26 19:40:34 & Turkey is not an oil rich country!

2227 2018-12-26 19:39:58 What is with paper towels in tv commercials man? They can sop up oil spills. But in my kitchen, they barely absorb a droplet of orange juice. #falseadvertising
2228 2018-12-26 19:39:57 it doesn’t get u high but i combine it with pure thc oil so i can also stay fuckin lit

2230 2018-12-26 19:39:37 I just got home from Morocco earlier today, and I got it at an argan oil cosmetics factory in the Atlas mountains, so it's sadly a bit hard to come by :/
2231 2018-12-26 19:39:33 Just found a half full oil cart in my jacket all praise be to my jacket thanks u never let me down
2232 2018-12-26 19:39:29 Obviously we don't know which of these terms were accepted beyond military access (both ways, although YPG troops have been in government territory for over a year) and Syrian control of the oil fields (which Muslim confirmed about 4 days ago)
2233 2018-12-26 19:39:15 That man reputedly gets something like 50% of the oil profits in Russia so he's got a big old case of Don't Give A Shit About Anybody Else I Got Mine Well, aside from wanting back all the territory ceded after the collapse of the USSR, which he's working on.
2234 2018-12-26 19:39:15 I’ve never paid for an oil change.....
2235 2018-12-26 19:39:14 Permit me to dedicate this to Aisha Abdulganiyu, a friend who committed suicide few hours Ago
2236 2018-12-26 19:39:05 I use my wood boards for fruits, veggies, and bread.  A wipe with a damp cloth does it, with an occasional treatment with a good wood oil. Silicon mats for meats, fish, and cheese. Quick dip in a sink of warm sudsy water (which is a prep item in my kitchen) keeps chaos at bay.
2237 2018-12-26 19:39:04 Q3 I doubt that they'll let DB go bust but it'll probably be a bail-in with the "Cyprus-Debacle" as a template. Yet there are other bit players in trouble too the leveraged loans markets + fracking oil producers who have to be screaming with the current low prices. It matters 1/2
2238 2018-12-26 19:38:59 Oil played far deeper in the anchor role and Fleck pushed on. He can’t dictate the game from there currently BUT Fleck far for effective
2239 2018-12-26 19:38:35 Sunil Maharaj the new CEO of Maluju Oil,The nerve of Zakiti voting an men out of an company who brought her up all years as his own child because of Power and Greed  I hope Maharaj sidelines her #ImbewuTheSeed 
2240 2018-12-26 19:38:22 It's the same. If you just want Deutschland you can do B-1. I just did B-4 cause I run Washington+Cassin+Downs for 17 oil
2241 2018-12-26 19:38:16 You want to be the one to rub the oil on the model?
2242 2018-12-26 19:38:15 Olbas Oil is pretty amazing stuff. Literally eased my sinus pain in seconds.
2243 2018-12-26 19:38:13 Iv never had a oil change over 40 bucks, even my duramax was only 40
2244 2018-12-26 19:38:11 Romance is like a fire on snow, it's warm and comforting but fades away easily if you don't keep adding oil.
2245 2018-12-26 19:38:09 If @davidsirota was an honest journalist, rather than a dishonest propagandist, you would know that Beto didn’t break a pledge, and didn’t take PAC money from the oil industry. He did take individual donations from employees of the largest industry in his state.
2246 2018-12-26 19:37:54 But did you know Bernie took more oil money in 2016 than Rick Perry? Looks like my Bernie vote was misplaced. Perry 2020!
2247 2018-12-26 19:37:54 「Engine Oil ～speed&power！～」－ほろ
2248 2018-12-26 19:37:36 The current government pushing billions into expanding oil and pipelines, refusing to meet our Paris agreements, expanding Ontario forests and repealing clean water acts.

Canadians might, our government less so.
2249 2018-12-26 19:37:35 CNBC: Oil surges 8%, erasing Christmas Eve losses
2250 2018-12-26 19:37:34 I bought AMLP hard this morning, locked in 10% yield in SDIRA...I think oil has overshot, and high quality energy names are at THE bottom...
2251 2018-12-26 19:37:32 Dumpty's gotta look after all those oil interests after all.

Putin says.

#SimonSezPrez
2252 2018-12-26 19:37:28 But you gotta understand that you're paying 60k for a decent Model 3 as apposed to a decent 14k Hyundai Elantra or decent 16k Toyota Camry. In my years of owning a 2013 Hyundai Elantra Limited I've only changed the oil and tire rotation, that's it!
2253 2018-12-26 19:37:25 You could support #BuildTheWall .
You could support changing laws that draw these ppl in. But you won't.
It's all about dems winning and Trump losing.
These migrants suffer,  the American ppl are divided because you and rest of Congress refuse to do your job
2254 2018-12-26 19:37:24 So yea my oil target is 84... I think we rally the overall market on this $spx to 2625ish, then the additional costs come in and kick is right in the pants...roll back over early January
2255 2018-12-26 19:37:20 Love the oil rugs that just keep pumping that are ingrained on the US flag. That just about says it all! Profits, corruption, and religion all rolled into one big pile of shit!
2256 2018-12-26 19:37:20 酷くない？生きてるよ
2257 2018-12-26 19:37:15 What's the maintenance cost of oil engine vs electric?
2258 2018-12-26 19:36:58 1.Lorenzonun yağı (lorenz Oil)  2.Karavan(the leisure seeker).         3. Kırmızı leke (the scarlet Letter)
2259 2018-12-26 19:36:57 So far we know that the main terms for the SDF were that the SAA send troops to help finish Daesh, and help defend against Turkey (that's mutual) as well as recognise Rojava as an independent nation

The Syrian Government's main terms are military access and control of oil fields
2260 2018-12-26 19:36:47 It’s amazing how tied the stock market is to crude oil right now.
2261 2018-12-26 19:36:26 класс
2262 2018-12-26 19:36:18 Just about wrapped up on listening to this podcast. You guys are at the part about "millions will die" if we continue with someone like Obama, biggest oil president, in regards to the facts surrounding climate change. Great point.

I just want to add to that a little bit.. +
2263 2018-12-26 19:36:16 Babu bhaiyya

Which edible oil is in 12% on 2014???

2264 2018-12-26 19:36:13 I got scratched up by a kitten a few days ago, used cocoa butter oil on the scratches, and they were gone in 2 days..... no cap lol
2265 2018-12-26 19:36:01 he still wants the oil.
2266 2018-12-26 19:35:57 You know I love you. But I took issue with @davidsirota myself on this point. The vast majority were under $200 from average workers in a state where the fossil fuel industry is the biggest employer. What is accurate is he broke his pledge not to accept money from oil execs.
2267 2018-12-26 19:35:56 Cuz she still has to stack that oil lobby money yo
2268 2018-12-26 19:35:52 Must keep troops there to seize the oil they owe us as part of the transaction to free them.
2269 2018-12-26 19:35:51 The Tariff Man said he’s going to strike a great oil deal with Saddam face to face because Saddam won’t answer his calls. Need to keep winning!

me: he’s dead
2271 2018-12-26 19:35:48 i think the one thing i hate the most about being an adult is getting oil changes
2272 2018-12-26 19:35:47 Further, Democrats are NOT in the pockets w/big oil. You’re way off & just merely trying to paint Democrats as the same as Republicans. It doesn’t take a genius to see you’re just wrong & a bit uninformed. You’re on the right side, but you gotta do more homework.
2273 2018-12-26 19:35:17 What about oil massagge

2291 2018-12-26 19:32:23 Corbyn considered Chavez to be a champion of the poor who had been totally left behind by rampant corruption & pro corp right wing leaders the socialists replaced. Chavez’s success rode the wave of high oil prices whilst his anti capitalist rhetoric angered powerful interests 1.

2296 2018-12-26 19:31:48 oil has a long ways to go higher along with sp500. Trump called the bottom today.
2297 2018-12-26 19:31:33 Yeah honestly I’m super excited to see this. Oil spills are fuckin beautiful
2298 2018-12-26 19:31:22 Sorry if I missed a bunch of calls last night and this morning but I needed to up my dose with the THC and CBD oil and kinda slept in for the good part of the day!!! WOW! Feel great. Now what happened in the past 12 hours?

2300 2018-12-26 19:31:16 え。幸子死んでる説ある？
2301 2018-12-26 19:31:06 Dude. The issue is that Beto accepted money from oil/gas executives which violated his “no oil money pledge”. Simple and irrefutable fact. Do try to keep up.

And GTFOH with the pathetic whataboutisms.

2305 2018-12-26 19:30:46 I mean....its a cone dipped in oil and coated with kief.  

Might not look the prettiest but the punch is there :P
2306 2018-12-26 19:30:45 Instead, Sirota is telling you the truth by showing how a $25 donation from a pipeline welder means that Beto is in the pocket of big oil? Just trying to figure out who’s shaping your thinking these days.
2307 2018-12-26 19:30:40 Lol. Nigerian food is just alot of oil and chillies. So now?
2308 2018-12-26 19:30:35 CBD oil makes me so tired the next day I understand why my barber was like 45 minutes late to several of my appointments.

2310 2018-12-26 19:30:35 Brace yourself for the tweetstorm saying he never intended a two week vacay to Margo Lago. The fake news media should have known all along his plan was to go to Iraq. Then something new and hilariously embarrassing will spurt out of him like an oil derrick striking a sewage line.

2313 2018-12-26 19:29:59 Quite a bit, actually.  Already puritanical bernie-ites. are trying to paint Beto as somehow beholden to oil money when in fact the small donations came independently from company employees.
2314 2018-12-26 19:29:57 I understand your sentiments. So let me try another way.
1. Do you feel that wind & solar are better as they don't produce as much CO2?
2. FYI, there is nothing called dirty oil. That's emotive political mumbo jumbo that's factually incorrect. Some research will help you on it.
2315 2018-12-26 19:29:49 Still wondering why Nigerians still  heavily depends on Crude oil,when clearly they can see the impact of ICT in US GDP
2316 2018-12-26 19:29:45 Also - no more nepotism (Jared, etc).
No more giving govt positions to large donors (Devos).
Appts based on merit only!
Guys like Tillerson shld not be appointed where there are conflicts of interest (Russian oil).
Press Sec shld be held to higher standard (no lying).

2317 2018-12-26 19:29:42 who care u believe in climate change they abolish DST why?  Because when the clocks go ahead and it iis light outside GAS CONSUMPTION increases - and they know it the oil industry has known this since 1930's!
2318 2018-12-26 19:29:36 Tbh that’s not fair. All they’ve got going for them are the entire oil reserves of Abu Dhabi. So take it easy on them.

2322 2018-12-26 19:28:55 Olive oil u look sexy
2323 2018-12-26 19:28:38 the most traumatizing thing that i witnessed at calarts was when this chick from ohio made guacamole with olive oil instead of lime or lemon ive actually never recovered from seeing that
2324 2018-12-26 19:28:37 And how about you explain to me how these people who oppose climate change are flying around in personal jets, meeting with the coal industry, and making millions? Trust me, if scientists could be bought, oil and coal would have made it rain in nerd town a long time ago.
2325 2018-12-26 19:28:33 But most cars don't have automatic software changes that leave in disabled, most cars don't have wheels and bumpers falling off, or windows forced open in the rain, or frozen doors. I think I'd rather change the oil.
2326 2018-12-26 19:28:32 See the condition of farmers modi govt can't supply even urea to all states .....this is when natural gas and crude oil prices have cracked down.... Now don't say fertilizer plants are run by state govt ....
2327 2018-12-26 19:28:21 Most people won't know what this is about. They will most likely say, "but they can intefere in ours!? Fuck the Russians!". That's great and all, but who supplies Europe with oil? Russia. It's simpler than what people make it out to be. The strangehold on oil distribution.

2334 2018-12-26 19:27:22 Now if you connect the dots to the oil wealthy muzzies/izlamm who financed Hitler, and see how theyre all connected , you will have it all figured out

2339 2018-12-26 19:26:40 I worked ina large city Transportation Dept. we were talking about Carbon Tax in the 1990’s. Our state had it on the ballot this Nov. unfortunately big oil won with their lies. 
2340 2018-12-26 19:26:36 Meeting my ex for his lunch break today and I’m really hoping he gonna change the oil on my car 
2341 2018-12-26 19:26:34 My mother swears by pure black seed oil as a facial moisturizer though

2344 2018-12-26 19:26:05 New Sealsnd is a volcanic chain.  Have they ever found any oil?
2345 2018-12-26 19:26:03 Have 3 days off this week, my plans were to work around the yard, clean the garage, do the oil change on all the cars, and maintain my daily workout. What have I’ve done so far? Sleep
2346 2018-12-26 19:25:40 Your nuclear power plants would melt down, your offshore oil rigs would start spilling, most of your packages and shipments wouldn't arrive, your plumbing problems won't be fixed, and most planes would fall out of the sky, killing thousands.

Imagine being thankful for men.
2347 2018-12-26 19:25:24 Now, we just need the study to add pizza and burritos to the list. Where’s an oil or tobacco industry scientist when we need one?!
2348 2018-12-26 19:25:22 Possibly. But EVs will shift dramatically the demand curve. That will change substantially investment, lower it, into production. It means some amount of oil won't be recovered.
2349 2018-12-26 19:25:18 It’d be great if somebody bought me an oil diffuser & lavender or vanilla scents for my water birth . Thenks

2351 2018-12-26 19:24:55 No lol.. they told me my oil was milky and I’d need a new engine. I said just do the oil change i asked for. Went to my mechanic in Indy and they said there’s nothing wrong w the oil/engine. Did an expensive test and the oil has definitely not been changed 2 weeks ago there.

2369 2018-12-26 19:22:30 I agree it’s oversold. Oil is tricky. V good long term for economies but v bad for large cap oil companies and falling equity markets. But still - this and the whole Syrian comment is Saudis paying back for their brutality. A horrifying equation.
2370 2018-12-26 19:22:27 I stopped off to visit my dad, who has a little production in Shackelford County. He said the drop in oil pretty much offset whatever gains had been made by the cattle operation. Usually, it’s the other way around.

2375 2018-12-26 19:21:39 The hemp seed oil is made from pressed hemp seeds. This oil has basically no CBD but is rich in omega-3s which help your body use CBD oil effectively. CBD oil is made from the hemp plant, mainly the hemp flower. 
2376 2018-12-26 19:21:33 If it wasn’t for their oil the Saudis would be nothing but another tribe of herdsmen.

2380 2018-12-26 19:21:16 Total energy drain right now. Christmas is taken down but not put away. Still need to vacuum pine needles. I have to rest for a little bit. My only calories are from MCT oil. Trying to get back into ketosis quickly.

2388 2018-12-26 19:20:17 @clairecmc Your lack of understanding of the "Ocasio-Cortez phenomenon is precisely why the Democrats fail. Us working white people want a rep who is not in the pocket of big oil and big business.

2390 2018-12-26 19:19:59 A pullback in oil is likely
2391 2018-12-26 19:19:58 Omg!!!! Yes!!! You’re not alone  I know some ways you can manage it. For example don’t take fish oil , avoid stress (which is hard because vertigo brings stress) there’s certain exercises that help control it. And avoid alcohol.
2392 2018-12-26 19:19:50 The price has plunged due to both strong production by Saudi Arabia and USA plus Iranian sanction waivers and declining global growth. The irony is low prices keep oil in ground but lead to high prices that spur production. Will EVs fundamentally change oil price cycle? Yes.
2393 2018-12-26 19:19:49 I'm sure the next batch of snake oil will be the one that cures us of all our ills

2473 2018-12-26 19:12:30 I don't want to be a great leader; I want to be a man who goes around with a little oil can and when he sees a breakdown, offers his help. To me, the man who does that is greater than any holy man in saffron-colored robes. -Baba Amte, social worker/activist

2594 2018-12-26 18:55:27 The best MM segment of the year has got to be @TermineRadio and @CohenNFL talking coconut oil and lube on the not so merry Christmas special! I was dying  @EvCoRadio @Babchik @MadDogRadio @JudgeTorre
2595 2018-12-26 18:55:26 I’m surprised tRump hasn’t called for the use of lamps that use oil so he could save the whaling industry!
2596 2018-12-26 18:55:14 I use sewing machine oil to lubricate cables. Works real well and is not gummy. Do it for all mine whenever servicing.
2597 2018-12-26 18:55:00 Aye but that tis a worthy spirit!

On another matter if you saw

2602 2018-12-26 18:54:25 Oh nah I use a light oil I know what you mean but that’s a waste of money in my opinion
2603 2018-12-26 18:54:22 Because he signed a pledge (and broke it) saying that he was not going to take oil exec money.
2604 2018-12-26 18:54:05 Yes Dave that socialism you love so much has wrought this upon a country swimming in oil.
2605 2018-12-26 18:54:04 What Qaddafi was planning to do was a threat to the colonizers. They dont want Africa United. He was uniting African nations and moving toward requiring gold for oil. USA & UK didnt want that.
2606 2018-12-26 18:54:01 , processing, distribution, or sale of oil, gas, or coal.”
2607 2018-12-26 18:53:54 Why the fuck do we want oil to win the league over Liverpool? Let Liverpool have it. Fuck Manchester City.
2608 2018-12-26 18:53:51 oil change usa The pledge stipulates that in signing it, “a politician and their campaign will adopt a policy to not knowingly accept any contributions over $200 from the PACs, executives, or front groups of fossil fuel companies—companies whose primary business is the extraction
2609 2018-12-26 18:53:50 He didn't conflate anything. What you're talking about is the inference that occurs when you look at that information. That inference is valid - the individual contributors include gas and oil execs making >$200 donations. Which Beto himself thinks is a relevant distinction...
2610 2018-12-26 18:53:49 How do I buy oil stocks?
2611 2018-12-26 18:53:30 "people from norway and alaska are profiting off of oil natural ressources, they will kill the jews any day now, freaking nazifascistsocialists"
2612 2018-12-26 18:53:28 (Jas.5:14) What is the anointing for? Is there efficacy in the oil? No, there is not. The oil is a symbol of the healing & the power of the Holy Ghost. 
There is no efficacy in the oil, but there is efficacy in the act when it is administered by faith and prayer to God.
2613 2018-12-26 18:53:25 We dont give a good God damn about Alberta. Canada doesnt buy Russian and very little Saudi. What is not Canadian comes from USA. We sell to USA why not buy it? The point is to get off oil ASAP. You dont build pipelines is that is the objective. Without AB Tories seldom win bonus
2614 2018-12-26 18:53:25 until that pig locks up from no oil
2615 2018-12-26 18:53:13 This is why I want to be a porn star's assistant. I imagine part of the job is eating her out and giving her rimjobs to get her ready for a scene, probably lots of rubbing oil on her butt and boobs; tonguing then fingering then fucking her anus to get her ready for anal scenes...
2616 2018-12-26 18:53:02 Juan gave me an oil diffuser for Christmas AND ITS MY FAVORITE THING THAT I OWN 
2617 2018-12-26 18:52:44 I use avocado oil in the summer because coconut oil breaks me out when it’s too hot, maybe it’ll work!
2618 2018-12-26 18:52:37 You mean a light oil?
2619 2018-12-26 18:52:33 Just got some free wiper blades from Mr. Tire and they discount oil change $20 ... Holla at my mans Charles Tell em serg sent you
2620 2018-12-26 18:52:30 Don’t put lavender oil on an aromatherapy bracelet bc you’ll fall asleep EVERYWHERE
2621 2018-12-26 18:52:29 We can always trade oil for gas, if I believe your figures. We have an abundance of most of the things we need to survive and thrive!
2622 2018-12-26 18:52:20 The guy changing my oil told me I had a sweet voice. He also had a tear tattoo on his cheek, but we all mistakes right?

2627 2018-12-26 18:51:42 She actually said “cook with healthy fats, like canola and corn oil”.
2628 2018-12-26 18:51:26 In a cast iron pan simmer chopped onions, 2-3 rings of Serrano in Olive oil & coarse salt. Add chopped tomatoes, garlic, when mixture souces up, add separated egg whites, stirr,  add more chopped tomatoes, stir, add the egg yolks one at a time, finish with parsley #PCCMRecipes
2629 2018-12-26 18:51:21 Listen up, the ingredients for the appetizer round are: 
 
 Red velvet whoopie pies,

2630 2018-12-26 18:51:19 Avocado Oil?
2631 2018-12-26 18:51:14 US markets rebounding strongly, and oil jumping higher.
A well worded hydrocarbons RNS and we will soar back into double figures.
2632 2018-12-26 18:51:13 Also Ontarians paid billions to get our oil industry off the ground. And if AB doesn't start to address some of the industry's biggest messes now Ontarians and the rest of Canada will pick up the cleaning bill too.
2633 2018-12-26 18:51:06 Peppermint oil for headaches.. who knew?! Stuff really works..

2635 2018-12-26 18:51:00 Was he supposed to comb through ActBlue to find out who is employed by an oil and gas company? Do you not take $ from the janitor at Exxon? Those kinds of donations do not buy influence. I have more trouble with Sanders taking NRA money, as he’s done in the past.
2636 2018-12-26 18:50:57 CBD OIL AND HYDROGEN PEROXID (internal and external) -THE BEST!!!! 
2637 2018-12-26 18:50:45 Otedola to sell Forte Oil shares, exit fuel business.

No more subsidy padding.

2638 2018-12-26 18:50:42 Now THAT would be a free-market KO punch to the oil and gas industry wouldn’t it?
2639 2018-12-26 18:50:40 Petrol was Rs. 65 when oil was $30/barrel and and Rs. 89 when oil was $75. Now its $44 and petrol Rs. 98. Instead of asking for Petrol at Rs. 46 you are arguing here. PTI is unable to manage with cheap LNG when PML N delivered cheap electricity with furnace oil. Wow
2640 2018-12-26 18:50:34 we call it a funny name here bt my mom just clowned me saying its translation is literally axe oil....ok then!

2645 2018-12-26 18:49:59 They are a mess, but that has more to do with tax cuts and infrastructure decay from decades of neglect. But financially they are in better shape. They are in less debt than us when you add in environmental clean up of the oil industry. 
Let's not get smug here.

2652 2018-12-26 18:49:16 Recent selling “has felt less fundamentally driven and more a function of the overall market meltdown as increased equity volatility and growing macro concerns have weighed on a number of asset classes,” wrote analysts at Tudor, Pickering & Holt. #oil $OSX $OIH $USO #OOTT

2657 2018-12-26 18:48:49 No, Sirota purposely conflated money from individuals involved in the oil/ gas industry with industry money. That is revealing as to what Sirota is attempting to do. He has made himself the story and that is not journalism.

2660 2018-12-26 18:48:21 At #Venezuela’s state-run oil Co. “some employees only show up to eat at the few company cafeterias that remain open. Shippers told @Reuters that #PDVSA workers at times board vessels to ask for food.”
Amazing new report on the crisis from @AlexandraUlmer and @mariannaparraga

2662 2018-12-26 18:48:15 Who has the most to gain, some rich American that has a vast interest in Alberta oil sands, separation is a billionaires wet dream.
2663 2018-12-26 18:48:15 Condom, baby, baby oil. Good ring to it xD
2664 2018-12-26 18:48:06 Oh man.....I thought you filled your blinkers up by dumping old oil into your gas tank. Boy have I been doing it wrong.

2666 2018-12-26 18:48:00 Oddly the Ford family was against it. They thought car companies and owners should have to pay for highways themselves, without the federal government contributing.

All other car and oil companies were for it because obviously
2667 2018-12-26 18:48:00 Let me add, we use them today for oil and gas rigs.... They pay for themselves in very short order. It allows us to put down wells in very remote ares. All we need is a dirt road for trucking.
2668 2018-12-26 18:47:57 walked into the kitchen, tried to lift a pot

touched a fuckton of oil

He is just a scruffy depressed piece of shit that smells like oil, soot and sadness.
2670 2018-12-26 18:47:42 Crude oil sits at $45. That brings bad forecast
2671 2018-12-26 18:47:29 So you are telling Scots that they do not pay taxes and that their corporations and oil and gas are not taxed. They will be delighted to learn that because at the moment they think that they do.
2672 2018-12-26 18:47:29 I am thankful that President Trump is bringing our service men and women home. Now we don't have to be the POLICE FORCE for OIL COMPANIES in Syria like GENIE OIL & GAS!

TRUMP UM AGAIN 2020!!!
2673 2018-12-26 18:47:24 UAE basically used slave labour. Doesn’t take anything away from the fact that Alberta basically squandered their oil wealth.
2674 2018-12-26 18:47:15 You needa go to @Bad_Thad oil change and wash for bout $55
2675 2018-12-26 18:46:54 I hope my S/O knows shit about cars cause I’m just an idiot. And I’ll be honest about it. Like I’ll remind you to buy the right bread but you gotta tell me when to go get an oil change.
2676 2018-12-26 18:46:51 I hate that zee world tbh 
My parents r always complaining n they keep on watching 
2677 2018-12-26 18:46:50 Oil use per capita is not growing like it did. But oil is far from over as a fuel even as it's displaced. NatGas is going to be relatively cheap but we are in the early stages of demand growth. The business is cyclical/seasonal too.

2680 2018-12-26 18:46:36 Energy Stewarding. com is a Oil & Gas person who is learning more about alternative energy sources & sharing knowledge. He made a statement that I agree with 100%.

2681 2018-12-26 18:46:33 +Crude oil bounced 
2682 2018-12-26 18:46:27 At least you won't need to sweeten those fraises des bois you're coming home with. But with all that boiling oil it could mean doughnuts. :(

2684 2018-12-26 18:46:21 The legitimizing rationale is... that Americans knew what they were getting when they voted for Donald Trump & his snake oil fix in 2016.
The sad fact is... THAT MANY TOOK A CHANCE & DID NOT KNOW HE WAS SIMPLY A BIG STAKES CON MAN & THE SNAKE OIL FIX WAS THE CON.

2688 2018-12-26 18:46:09 Of course I need an oil change 
2689 2018-12-26 18:46:08 Yes, of course I was kidding Not Gary Lineker.  I know nothing about what the future holds for sure, lots of potential futures there are... Yoda told me so...  Did you apply for the oil clean up job?

2691 2018-12-26 18:45:53 When you make a donation, you're required to put down your employer, job description.  My $5 donations to 2016 candidates show up as from the transportation industry. Beto's oil/gas donations were employees, not Corporate.
2692 2018-12-26 18:45:48 The alternatives to palm oil are far more environmentally damaging though.
2693 2018-12-26 18:45:47 Bisa jadi pengganti/pelengkap moist, kalo berapa kalinya tergantung jenis oil juga nder. Soalnya ada beberapa yang gabisa kena uv (?) jadi cuma bisa dipake malem. Ada juga yang bisa dipake kapan aja, mending konsul sama sellernya aja biar lebih mantep
2694 2018-12-26 18:45:46 @realdonaldtrump has managed to stay off Twitter for 19 hours. The stock market and oil prices are going up. Wanna bet the moment he takes to Twitter to trash the Fed/Dems/Fake News, it all goes down again?
2695 2018-12-26 18:45:45 Into an economy that produces little else besides oil? You might find that’s hyperinflationary.
2696 2018-12-26 18:45:43 That looked like it hurt! We were up at devils elbow. There was a load of oil down and every lap someone had a near miss!
2697 2018-12-26 18:45:30 They need new ideas

2699 2018-12-26 18:45:12 Depending on your tolerance for scents - potpourri, scented talc, cotton with a few drops of perfume or essential oil. If any of the shakers are clear, you can fill them with colored sand or small shells.
2700 2018-12-26 18:45:11 Now Oil is up 7-8%, Rs must hold 69 - 70 tomorrow ?

2705 2018-12-26 18:44:38 What about olive oil?
2706 2018-12-26 18:44:25 I need mustard oil but the halal grocer is mysteriously not open!
2707 2018-12-26 18:44:13 It's the brown shoe polish they use. Gets in your skin. Us hole snipes are immune do to being bathed in lube oil and fuel used for boilers.
2708 2018-12-26 18:44:06 Quality of management & the oil tanker sector:
Talk about a space where execution is the difference between success & disaster.
Look at $GLNG where management has been nimble in positioning assets for best utilization.
Compare that to the stewardship of the Tsakos family & $TNP
2709 2018-12-26 18:43:58 I think the safest bet is to reduce oil as much as is practicable.
2710 2018-12-26 18:43:58 Exactly 
2711 2018-12-26 18:43:56 This disaster has a reason: Maduro's government has the intention to wreck the Venezuelan Oil Industry, thus Russia and China have the door open to enter in the rebuilding,  and also they take the control of gold and other valuable minerals at the South of Venezuela! That's all!
2712 2018-12-26 18:43:47 
2713 2018-12-26 18:43:40 aye check this vape oil im high af lol
2714 2018-12-26 18:43:36 Whilst Japan kills whales it will at least reduce the need for krill. So westerners can mine the oceans for a completely unnecessary supplement. In the meantime the Chinese serve up Rhino horn and shark fin soup. The west guzzles palm oil grown where prime rain Forrest once stood
2715 2018-12-26 18:43:27 Yo twitter. My check engine light has been on for a minute but I’ve gotten two oil changes and have had my cousin who’s a mechanic check it and each time they’ve said everything seems fine. I’ve heard it can come on if you have gas cap issues? Is this bullshit or legit?
2716 2018-12-26 18:43:27 We typically change oil in Nov and April. Hours add up before Kms typically.  0W40 for winter 15w40 for seeding through Harvest.
2717 2018-12-26 18:43:24 You have in your hand a key of life or death for our country. 
With my expertise, I am asking you to consider to take election nationwide without exception, or you are risking to put oil in fire. Don't live anya part the country , as you know the coutry is risking balkanisation.
2718 2018-12-26 18:43:22 Abusite
2719 2018-12-26 18:42:51 I have concluded, based on the evidence available - as have 97% of scientists studying the issue, that there is a significant relationship between CO2 and climate change. Major oil & gas producers know this.
2720 2018-12-26 18:42:39 Oil up melania
2721 2018-12-26 18:42:25 Who are we holding the line for General? Genie Energy? Is that what are troops  are suppose to be used for? Enriching millionaires and billionaires with oil profits from stolen oil?
2722 2018-12-26 18:42:14 Luckily its really easy to find good, quick, easy vegan food now! Sainsbury's is probably the best supermarket but the others are really catching up. Plastic and packaging and palm oil are a bit trickier to avoid though.

2726 2018-12-26 18:41:37 America has ruined the perception of white people all over the world. The killing of blacks, jailing of blacks, bombing & stealing oil.

2728 2018-12-26 18:41:03 There’s a large number of English people & non-Brits in Aberdeen due to oil industry. I guess a large number of them voted No. Celtic fans still laying this at Dons’s fans door over 4 years on is tedious and lazy

2731 2018-12-26 18:40:18 Realistically that is not going to happen anytime soon. But alternatives to palm oil exist and companies should be 'persuaded' to use them.
2732 2018-12-26 18:40:10 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Oakland sleeps.

2734 2018-12-26 18:40:10 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Oakland sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

2737 2018-12-26 18:39:54 Venezuela’s economy is built on oil exports with little domestic diversification. It pegs its currency to the USD and the majority of its debts are denominated in USD. Corruption is rife. Black USD market. Weak govt institutions. Oil price collapse began the implosion. Sanctions.

2740 2018-12-26 18:39:46 That's the Sanders scam...he targets the largest employers in a state and attacks candidates for donations in those sectors...for Texas, that's oil and if a secretary at an oil company donates to Beto, it goes down as a Petro industry donation...the media has been terribly...
2741 2018-12-26 18:39:40 Today is my day of rest. Coconut oil in the hair, kitten on my lap, streaming on the tele. Tmo I will begin research for the PD I'm putting together. Oh the joy of guilt free procrastination.
2742 2018-12-26 18:39:39 Trump follows money and deals not troops. Turkey maybe? Tupras oil refinery, new oil find off Turkish coast, payment for leaving Syria, who knows.
2743 2018-12-26 18:39:18 The solution is to be oil free, or as oil free as possible, a boycott of palm oil just destroys more ecosystem elsewhere.
2744 2018-12-26 18:39:12 Fox News Anchors know that when Trump starts whining, a famous mouse writes a song about #love
2745 2018-12-26 18:39:02 How sir? ports hv bn concessioned. Who pays for  trucking & transport logistics to other parts of Nigeria; that's the subsidy. Oil sector reforms is d way to go,both upstream& downstream but some guys are feeding fat on subsidy. Its a tricky situation though

2750 2018-12-26 18:38:26 @ExpressOil just left your Buford Ga location. Did not get my oil changed. First was asked to pull up here, then back up and drive around the building and pull in there. Then I was asked to drive around the building again. I told the guy I was done dancing and left. Just lost me.
2751 2018-12-26 18:38:24 im getting my oil changed and waiting listening to music and my bluetooth connected to my car while they were working on it .... and i was listening to melodrama so i hope to god the worker at least sat and listened for a bit

2754 2018-12-26 18:38:18 Greenpeace informed me of that, until then I thought there was no such thing as sustainable palm oil, but they said it's mostly a view pushed by the media and it's actually very doable. I don't really know enough about it though.

2756 2018-12-26 18:38:14 By far, we store the greatest amount of energy in our bodies as saturated fat that we then metabolize,  as saturated fat, for energy production. We didn't evolve storing corn oil in our fat cells.

2760 2018-12-26 18:38:09 What f...… facts. do you have short attention span or just plain stupid. You work in Oil and Gas? Not surprised you are embarrassed to show who you are. people like you give social media a bad name. You believe in your 'facts', put your name to them! Not that difficult really

2764 2018-12-26 18:37:39 Amazing how many studies funded by coal and oil industry show that wind and solar are more costly.

2772 2018-12-26 18:36:28 I had my face oil in my purse to show my dermatologist what I’ve been using... It broke... So, I just washed my face and wiped the inside of my purse on my face cause I was refused to let it go to waste

2777 2018-12-26 18:36:18 Fucking around trying to collect all the fucking oil....wasting so many resources and now we are behind and threatened..not in a good place.
2778 2018-12-26 18:36:15 However, if Crude prices continue to hover around this rate, I am sure that NDA will reduce the ED and might also impose subsidies again on oil companies. This will only affect the fiscal deficit in the long run. A lot depends on the international market. (10/n)
2779 2018-12-26 18:35:55 I agree. What bothers me is when i see anyone being disingenuous to make a political point. Such as saying someone is getting oil and gas money when it is coming through individual donations.
2780 2018-12-26 18:35:46 Yeah sex is great but did you know in 1953 that the CIA Overthrew a democratically elected populist in Iran who nationalized the oil industry - The US then installed shah of Iran who would eventually be overthrown by an Islamic revolution.
2781 2018-12-26 18:35:36 Wyatt is the emotional oil that keeps Brandon and Callie emotionally inclined .
2782 2018-12-26 18:35:35 It's good to know the gop and others didn't want to boil Obama in oil everyday of his Presidency. Such good quality christians all of them. Merry Christmas bible bashers.
2783 2018-12-26 18:35:12 It is just really sad that the first illegal/criminal Pres we get isn't someone more intelligent, handsome & savvy, which would at least make it more exciting. Instead we get a fat, old, & stupid snake oil salesman who apparently received elocution lessons from a carnival barker.
2784 2018-12-26 18:35:08 Crude oil prices are down 40%, trading around $42 a barrel yet Californians are still paying $3.69 a gallon for gas while some states are now under $2 per gallon. California is now in the cheaper “winter blend” season. Guess that means we’ll never see $3 gas again. #taxes #prop
2785 2018-12-26 18:35:06 You gotta part the cheek you shaving & yeah & you gotta make sure you going in downward motions , coconut oil help for a smoother , closer shave . Its honestly difficult cause you cant really see so waxing it is a better option

2787 2018-12-26 18:35:03 Every dollar paid in cabron tax can be deducted from a dollar owed in royalties. 
And our oil companies are already given generous royalty exemptions on things like NG burned to make steam. Now they get a further break on the small amount of ctax they are actually required to pay
2788 2018-12-26 18:34:52 Gross that they added all these fees when oil was going to $200 /bbl and are never going to roll them off

2790 2018-12-26 18:34:45 Th Oil comp still make losses in LPG (Ths is still subsidized). Th subsidies r usually budgetd by Govt. nd it is part of th budget. 2016, planed subsidy ws Rs 30kcr. Ths will obviously cum frm people who pay Tax. (Remmber tht Modi askd fw of us 2 give up th subsidis in LPG).(8/n)

2794 2018-12-26 18:34:08 Also Russia, once ISIS takes over rest of Syria, they will police it & sell oil cheap to Putin for internal use. No way can Putin/Iran control  whole country, bc of cost$ & lack of troops, but w ISIS, yes, as long as Kurds are eliminated. Only hope Macron, & EU pressure  Erdogan
2795 2018-12-26 18:33:58 No dry shampoo on hand? A bit of baby powder soaks up oil until your next shower.
2796 2018-12-26 18:33:54 While my future career is yet to be figured, I think I might go into automotive if not energy related (oil and gas, power plant etc.). But right now, I need to secure any internship in the summer.
2797 2018-12-26 18:33:54 It’s still not wrong. The point is that Beto voted for a lot of shitty pro-corpoate, pro Big Oil, pro Wall St legislation. That’s not a lie or a misrepresentation. The fact that his variance from other Dems isn’t much speaks more about how many anti-working class Dems we have.
2798 2018-12-26 18:33:45 Why not block Saudi oil tankers and buy Alberta oil?

2802 2018-12-26 18:33:18 1. Why is it that important to you that we do wind & solar?
2. I am aware of sweetness or sourness of crude oil. Never come across "dirty oil" as a category. Not sure what you mean by "dirty oil". Buyers (primarily the USA) buy & price oil based on it's refinability.
2803 2018-12-26 18:33:01 The olive oil breaks down makeup in the brushes and deep conditions the bristles to make them soft & flexible !
2804 2018-12-26 18:32:57 one time i left a bottle of olive oil at maria's house so i went back to get it and i found her gently caressing the olive oil while crying
2805 2018-12-26 18:32:56 When the CIA and Brits worked together to overthrow Mossadegh - who was democratically elected - because he wanted to stop Brit control of Iranian oil, things got ugly and have never recovered. Obama's attempts to return money that was rightfully theirs was to rebuild trust.

2811 2018-12-26 18:32:29 I.e. Saying the 3 Magi brought silver, saffron & palm oil to the manger would be “factually” inaccurate. Saying they were there to honor the birth of the Son of God is a doctrinal claim.

2832 2018-12-26 18:29:46 Bernie has also accepted donations from oil execs. Nobody’s giving Bernie a free ride this time.
2833 2018-12-26 18:29:31 WTI crude oil was up by more than 8%, but couldn't take out Monday's high. The DJIA was up by more than 500 points, but could fill the chart gap left on Monday. Grain & oilseeds under pressure testing chart support. Erratic / Volatile holiday trade continues. #oatt

2840 2018-12-26 18:29:03 Do you just heat it up or have you ever fried it?  Put in a pan with oil and leave it alone.  Let it almost burn. Flip like a pancake.  It has a completely different taste.  Yum yum.

2844 2018-12-26 18:28:37 People are free to interpret the data as they wish, but, at a minimum, getting large contributions from oil executives is a major problem.  Lower level contributions are debatable, but are all these employees contributing to someone who does not have their (1/2)

2846 2018-12-26 18:28:13 When the Crude prices dropped, during the Modi government, the subsidies were removed from petrol and diesel and the prices were “deregulated”. Deregulated means that the government will no longer regulate the oil prices. (6/n)
2847 2018-12-26 18:28:06 I read that and I always make sure to follow it! I think it’s bc the pill is fatty, so it dissolves best with other fats. I always take it with my biggest meal of the day. They even recommend taking it with a spoonful of peanut butter or olive oil! How bad is your relapse?
2848 2018-12-26 18:28:00 Consider 2/4 top are oil rich and 2/4 have tens of millions of ppl,

2851 2018-12-26 18:27:39 Use olive oil to soften and soothe your cuticles. Dip a cotton ball in olive oil and apply to fingers and toes.
2852 2018-12-26 18:27:36 Ooh why the olive oil?

2857 2018-12-26 18:26:49 Nobody can capture the mood as Modi ji can. And that's no small achievement. Idiots like #Pappu can make a fool of themselves, trying to peddle snake oil. But Modi ji's credibility is unimpeachable.

2862 2018-12-26 18:26:18 This means there were subsidies which these oil companies had to bear. Essentially, if petrol is manufactured at Rs 80 and sold at Rs 70, then the balance Rs 10 will be borne as a subsidy by the oil company. (3/n)
2863 2018-12-26 18:26:13 Idk who needs to hear this but go get your cars oil change done

2868 2018-12-26 18:25:54 The exact dollars of savings may not have been the same. But had we stuck with Lougheed's rates we'd have 100s of billions in the bank today. Instead we get about a billion a year. And that's going to fall bc oil cos can subtract carbon taxes paid from royalties due.
2869 2018-12-26 18:25:52 The world should'nt be deceived. Nigeria is a failed State, it has No OIL , the OIL belongs to Biafrans and BIAFRA is not part of Nigeria

2872 2018-12-26 18:25:31 So you think it is BAD that Coulter is demanding Trump keeps his biggest election promise that got him elected? Without a wall on the WHOLE border by 2020 Trump will be a 1 term president and will be remembered as a liar and snake oil salesman. @realDonaldTrump BUILD THAT WALL!!!
2873 2018-12-26 18:25:28 Before 2015, when Crude was hovering above $100, the fuel prices were regulated to maintain stable petrol or diesel rates. This means that the oil companies were dictated by the government to maintain the prices “irrespective of the Crude rate increase” (2/n)

2884 2018-12-26 18:24:39 This is stupid, doesnt solve anything. Remember those poor NDF that got bombed to pieces. They need to hand over all arab border towns, then negotiate for the rest of the border and oil fields and dams in exchange for kurdish rights and kurdish ndf
2885 2018-12-26 18:24:38 I don't like this extendable arm either, but I am happy to see that the whole country is seriously trying to make the transition from oil to clean energy as soon as possible.
2886 2018-12-26 18:24:33 But is it really a holiday unless your 6yo has putty in her hair? Is it? (Canola oil and rubbing alcohol, should this ever happen to you. It is hell.)
2887 2018-12-26 18:24:25 What's the purpose of this poll? If people say 'yes' then are the states & central govt will accept it? No way. The #GSTCouncil didn't say anything about inclusion of oil under GST even in 28% slab. If it comes under #GST, the petrol price per litre will be < ₹ 50 in India!
2888 2018-12-26 18:24:21 We've always had a ton of oil here, Trump was just the first to make use of it. What's the news today
2889 2018-12-26 18:24:09 In the summer I cut off all lotion & started using Coconut oil & Shea butter, recently I cut off all name brand soap & started using raw black soap & peppermint soap

2891 2018-12-26 18:23:25 The Iranians should blame their oil industry: every barrel extracted (and wasted) makes the dollar that much stronger. 

Stronger dollar at expense of Iranian rial.

2948 2018-12-26 18:16:47 Big oil has provided many, many jobs. It also has supplied money from royalties and taxes from employees that pays for education and healthcare. As a teacher I appreciate Big Oil for all it does for Canada!

I didn't mention it but my last quoted price for ND oil was ~$19.50.
If TX is undergoing value destruction at their prices, then ND must be a full-on black hole.
2976 2018-12-26 18:13:36 I didn't make that claim, but it certainly has contributed. US oil production outpaced expectations quite a bit in 2018.

In my 2nd tweet, I clarified not to short sell. Currently looking for pullback opportunities as the trend will remain up as long as price >43.50.
2984 2018-12-26 18:12:45 the days of worrying about how Quebec feels are over. They are shrinking in size relative to ROC and no one even cares about their separatist threats anymore. its disingenuous politicians who hate Alberta oil. here's the plan - allow pipeline or lose west cash. pretty simple

3130 2018-12-26 17:55:43 The entire EV change is based on the idea of stopping it. It’s not about asking for subsidies.. it’s about cajoling the general public to make a smarter choice for everyone. And big oil fights every bit of it with their massive wealth, resources and influence.

3141 2018-12-26 17:54:19 So I'm going to have to disagree with you because the U.S. is one of the biggest oil producers. Not to mention the need to move away from fossil fuels in the first place. And as for China, do you really think the best argument is, "They're doing it too so why can't we?"

3158 2018-12-26 17:52:50 Japan alleges that they catch whales for "scientific purposes", but whale "products" go into lamp oil, soaps and fertilisers etc.   Very little whale meat is consumed by the Japanese.  The other 2 main whale-hunters are Norway and Iceland.  The killing of whales is emotive.

3163 2018-12-26 17:52:38 Japan has long used "scientific research" & "part of our culture" to justify the mass slaughter of whales and dolphins (as in the annual Taiji dolphin bloodbath). Some traditions should go the way of using ambergris in perfumes, whale oil for lamps & whale bones used in corsets.

3260 2018-12-26 17:42:05 It would guarantee a #secondterm if @realDonaldTrump Trump would release some of the US oil reserve and drop gas prices below $2/gal in the Midwest.
3261 2018-12-26 17:41:49 colonialists foster division so that the divided do their dirty work for them-UK,US etc do so because they have to control the worlds supply of oil to feel "safe" & as a bonus make money selling arms to those they have divided. Saudis are complicit as oil is all they have
3262 2018-12-26 17:41:45 I high key love the smell of tea tree oil ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
3263 2018-12-26 17:41:43 So if I wanted I could make a squid that could breath on land and instead of ink it releases oil that can be lit on fire?

3265 2018-12-26 17:41:42 Winter dry months no joke on the curly fro....I use peppermint oil to tame the flakes but willing to try something new....any other oils that keep the fro moisturized?
3266 2018-12-26 17:41:35 Been looking for sign of stabilisation from oil and we’re getting that today. A strong positive close for the #sp500 will set us up a bullish hammer reversal off a new low and set us up for a decent oversold rally#spy #oil #wti #cl
3267 2018-12-26 17:41:31 My people which of the cities would be best for someone that wants to work in the oil sector over there?
3268 2018-12-26 17:41:20 But we know the broad outlines of a healthy diet for *most* people - fruits (berries!), vegetables, fish, nuts, olive oil good; too much sugar, red meat, cured meats bad. The optimal fat/carb/protein balance remains unclear and likely different for different people.
3269 2018-12-26 17:41:16 At the dealership to get my oil change and tire rotation on. There's a slow leak on a tire, covered by road hazard warranty. I have 4mm left on 2 treads, that's about good enough for six weeks at my driving habits. Transmission software recall, too.
3270 2018-12-26 17:41:13 Since last 60days oil price has been decreased from 20or more  why you cant decrease bus fare atlest from 10%
3271 2018-12-26 17:41:03 The oil industry is subsidezied in many.. MANY ways.. to the time of man, MANY billions of US tax dollars annually. You can twist I any way you want, but oil subsidies have been around about as long as oil. And we can get even deeper into a war machine to protect its assets

And yes whenever it is in Araneta or fil oil i make it to a point to watch even after her UAAP yrs.  So right now I cheer for petron. I love the green squad but I love Mika a lil bit more.

3285 2018-12-26 17:39:42 See, this is it in a nutshell...the real argument is not about oil, it is about keeping Alberta down politically and keeping them impoverished. But keep those unsustainable transfer payments coming...those Quebeckers love the free money while they wallow in their sanctimony!
3286 2018-12-26 17:39:40 Worked a BS shift
Filled up the car

3288 2018-12-26 17:39:15 Now it goes to a philosophical question. People see a price tag. That’s as far as they look. The people with the bigger picture for everyone’s benefit, offer a carrot to entice them to make the right choice. And if you think oil, this ICE cars are not subsidized. Look again

3290 2018-12-26 17:39:13 Yes they would, but if we are in EU or EFTA and rUK have FTA with EU then that will apply to iScot too.  Also consider what we trade; oil, gas, water, food & drink etc. Things that are not easy to get elsewhere
3291 2018-12-26 17:39:13 Ladies and gentlemen,
I present to you our portable and affordable 3ml bottles of designer perfume oil.
.
Affordable because it's a price that won't tear your pocket or cause you to drink garri for days after purchase
Portable because you can "carry it everywhere you go".
3292 2018-12-26 17:39:07 $DDM trimmed nicely on added shares , 5 % for the week with interruptions 
$OAS trimmed same way for 3 %  , nice gains in #oil 
the $SE was expected to pop , but $HTZ keeping no new buys
3293 2018-12-26 17:38:49 Definitely drink tons of #turmeric (anyway you can get it - powder, tea, pills) to fight the inflammation of the nerve + #magnesium (pills, oil, etc) a natural muscle relaxer that even athletes use all the time after training sessions to help with sore muscles, nerves etc.
3294 2018-12-26 17:38:47 I agree. It’s just noise. Trump, profit taking and year end illiquidity are the main drivers. I’m surprised that @jimcramer thinks the oil move is a growth signal rather than a lot of it attributed to those Saudi animals “paying back” their dues.
3295 2018-12-26 17:38:45 Sometimes the billionaire oil fumes run dry. Don't worry. They will start to win again.  Too much money not to.

3297 2018-12-26 17:38:38 Te dejo la respuesta:
Although dollarization generates a modicum of monetary stability, the government continues to impose price controls and fund subsidies despite significant budgetary strains caused by low oil prices.

3302 2018-12-26 17:37:55 @HondaCanada Hello, after the recall on my honda crv, regarding the oil dilution, I have been hearing a semi-high pitch when I have my fan to either max or a level below max. Can you please provide any information regarding this issue?

How should I go about this?
3303 2018-12-26 17:37:48 Pardon me, but baloney.  Green socialism? What in the world are you talking about?  Payback to your oil patrons and coal funders by calling green technology socialism?  Guess you really are riding the Trump fear and llie train all the way instead of representing Texans

3313 2018-12-26 17:36:24 I’m suggesting they contributed to vol in November, & along with CTAs, helped to invert the curve. Then withdrew liquidity just as patience was wearing then. October was mostly due to the first leg down oil and weakening tech earnings. I’m focusing on transition to liquidation

3316 2018-12-26 17:36:07 Don't know how anyone can believe that the S&P 500 is going to do $175 in EPS for 2019.  The big oil companies alone will drive down that number.
3317 2018-12-26 17:36:02 What’s inaccurate and misleading in his story?  He broke his pledge, voted with trump a lot even tho in a blue seat, took big $ from oil/gas execs. Why isn’t that bad and why is it misleading to write it up?

3326 2018-12-26 17:34:38 Yeah sure. As long as oil stabilizes

3329 2018-12-26 17:34:30 Appearently my family used to illegally smuggle salami from Italy to the US by having our Italian relatives put false bottoms on bottles of oil and putting the salami under it.
3330 2018-12-26 17:34:24 All fat *can* be used to generate ketones. If the emphasis is ketone levels then you should use explicitly MCT oil. Next most ketogenic oil is going to be chia/flax/perilla.
3331 2018-12-26 17:34:13 circa 2016 when same guy was calling for crash, oil at 15, 50% of every oil and metal company bankrupt and Icahn was a dope for buying $FCX in the 5-6’s
3332 2018-12-26 17:34:12 it is very simple research to do, the fact that you have been brainwashed bu Suzuki et all instead of supporting National growth and prosperity is your real problem!  Sad that DJ Trump has helped Alberta oil get to market more than our own people!

those oil companies have some of the tiniest profit margins in the entire economy.
3337 2018-12-26 17:33:44 Q: What #USA is doing in middle east ?

3343 2018-12-26 17:33:19 That closed end fund utilizes leverage and has many oil companies in it.  Have you ever looked at $ASA?

3346 2018-12-26 17:33:07 isn't it similar to what bjp is doing with respect to the oil &petroleum prices and the loan waiving and the gst reduction on goods and what not. just when the big day is around the corner these guyz do everything they can to tilt the balance in their favour..sb ek jese bro

3354 2018-12-26 17:32:47 Last time we broke up oil I'm not sure it worked out so well.  They became richer than ever.
3355 2018-12-26 17:32:42 As a father of 2, I would not consider being in bed with big oil when science tells us we have little more than a decade to eliminate fossil fuels or face extinction as the “slightest slip”.

But that’s just me & my “radical” ideological standards.

That’s NOT how you dip a Hotdog on a Stick... can’t dip it in the batter and dunk it in the oil. @WitByndMsr and I cringed so hard (then waded through flasbacks of hot batter explosions)

3394 2018-12-26 17:28:21 It all comes to oil/petrodollar to these faux wonks smh.

So for that reason we must redouble our efforts to undermine & violently replace Assad returning Syria to it's worse days???

We certainly will not get control of a pipeline going through Syria while the regime is in play.
3395 2018-12-26 17:28:16 BREAKING:

3404 2018-12-26 17:27:34 I have been limiting dairy (even full fat dairy) because it was interfering with my weight loss goals. Lower dairy fat was the result.  Yes, coconut oil is mostly SFA not MCT, but either can be used in the process of generating ketones, which is what feeds the brain in those w/AZ
3405 2018-12-26 17:27:28 Cheaper than oil sand refining.

3425 2018-12-26 17:25:54 Hilarious that you equate #AB oil w/sewage

Quebec doesn't  buy Saudi oil. Quebec companies buy most of their oil from US.

Only province whose companies  that does is NB's Irving family.

All these remain more or less same. Hence, petrol price can't be linear to crude oil price...Simple. Merchant
3477 2018-12-26 17:20:19 This is a boon to Canada. Trudeau should take a page from the trump playbook and look after Canadians. We are sick to death of shipping our oil and wheat overseas and importing people who are not interested in assimilating into our culture.

They can barely support themselves (except w/oil) and Jews created a land of honey of the land now Israel. Problem?

3528 2018-12-26 17:13:57 State trying to get a rally in stocks while keeping gold suppressed (as usual) and as usual it won't work. This rally in stocks & oil goes nowhere until the USD is allowed to fall & gold set free. @LukeGromen

3538 2018-12-26 17:12:44 We should also take on the oil and gas companies to start paying their fair share in taxes.
3539 2018-12-26 17:12:42 A reminder of how trade wars are so easy to win. Thanks to Tariff Man and Talk Down Oil Prices Man, the Canadian dollar has depreciated by almost 10% against the USD in the past 12 months, not withstanding rate hikes by the Bank of Canada.
3540 2018-12-26 17:12:39 NYSE $TICK indicator has not dipped negative in at least the last 30 minutes. Algos are buying. It helps too that crude oil is up by 6%.

3552 2018-12-26 17:11:27 Sunflower oil is recommended because replacing SFAs with PUFAs and MUFAs in most cases decreases cardiovascular disease risk. It's not conventional wisdom. It's science.

Overconsuming calories as a result of too much added sunflower oil is definitely a possible problem.

3560 2018-12-26 17:10:24 The study of developmental economics is as important as the study of history. Venezuela is a mono-commodity (oil) economy & had a history of colonial exploitation.

3610 2018-12-26 17:06:55 Yes, that's why people went on to drill down on the donations to see how much came from oil company executives and lawyers, how many had given the maximum amount. And David also examined O'Rourke's voting record on related issues.

3654 2018-12-26 17:02:58 Personally, I'd like to see a huge and urgent effort in training folks here in Canada first, like laid-off oil workers in Alberta, to be ready for these jobs, both now and in the future.
3655 2018-12-26 17:02:57 Lol! Escalating what? There's never going to be a nuclear war with Russia. As soon as the U.S. leave Syria, Russia with the help of Assad and his people, is planning to take control of oil pipeline in Syria goes all the way to the black sea
3656 2018-12-26 17:02:46 The problem isn't that he's examining O'Rourke's record (though one might reasonably question the timing), it's that he's distorting it. Individual oil workers' donations are simply not the same thing as corporate support.
3657 2018-12-26 17:02:42 sana oil...
3658 2018-12-26 17:02:39 Alberta oil sector doesn’t want any carbon tax (supported by Jason Kennedy) they wont a free ride. If the Alberta oil industry gets what it wants the rest of the economy will have to shrink overall emissions by 80 percent to meet Canada’s obligations.
3659 2018-12-26 17:02:35 @TheDriveway_US how might one get an appointment for an oil change on a 2016 q3?

3664 2018-12-26 17:02:05 He’s from west Texas. You’re going to have a lot of constituents in the oil and gas industry.
3665 2018-12-26 17:02:03 Don't worry. Only 6 more days till the Abu Dhabi government pump £200m of oil money into the January window.
3666 2018-12-26 17:02:02 Basic recipe is 1.5 cups flour, 1.5 cups oatmeal, 1/4 cups sugar, 1 tbsp baking powder, 1tsp salt, 2/3 cup oil, 1/3 cup OJ, 1 egg, 1 teaspoon vanilla, 1 cup chocolate chips, 1 cup walnuts. Mix dry, mix wet, combine. Bake 350 for 20min.
3667 2018-12-26 17:01:59 Well oil had a brain fart over UK markets closing days and is almost back at parity now to pre break.

BJP govt under PM Modi has inaugurated the Paradip Oil Refinery
3669 2018-12-26 17:01:50 But think about this, if you are concerned with lower income people you should admit that fossil fuels are very volatile while renewable source are not. The reason is that renewable costs are fundamentally debt service. Do you want the poor to live under the wild swings of oil?
3670 2018-12-26 17:01:50 No. You can't just cite individual donation #s & *assume* they include bundling or coordination. You need specific evidence, obvsly.

In the case of donations from oil & gas employees to O'Rourke, they *weren't* bundled or identified as coordinated. It was O'Rourke's policy...
3671 2018-12-26 17:01:48 I don't even understand this PH people, what are u people still doing in Oil mill on the 26th, see traffic 
3672 2018-12-26 17:01:40 There is no reason I should be sitting here still waiting on my car after 2 hours when I had an appointment for a freaking oil change. I’m mad. This is ridiculous.
3673 2018-12-26 17:01:36 Oil rose to $51 a barrel on perceptions that a price slide to 2017 lows prompted by economic worries had been overdone amid an OPEC-led effort to tighten supply.
3674 2018-12-26 17:01:29 India deserves RahulGandhi as PM, he is VaticanBabe, Pretend Hindu who will destroy India by loot plunder. @narendramodi grown economy without borrowing, paid off all Congressi oil debt.

3680 2018-12-26 17:01:08 The Labour Government had the vision back in 2008 to issue the exploratory shale Gas licences. The Conservative Government carried it on.Lancashire County Council only the other week gave its support for the industry.Even if Labour got in John McDonnell is supporting oil and Gas
3681 2018-12-26 17:01:05 Oil strong today, huge reversal from Monday's lows of $42/bbl. Now trading near $45/bbl.

3697 2018-12-26 17:00:08 No petroleum based plastic limbs for oil!
3698 2018-12-26 16:59:51 Wrong. In scandinavia there is SOCIAL democracy, NOT a socialism at all! And they heydays are gone. It is strong enough today only in Norway - which has oil to finance that social thing.

3701 2018-12-26 16:59:37 Castor oil and olive oil are both good and effective accessories to a good parasite cleanse as these oils kill parasites and worms by suffocating them. One teaspoon per day during cleanse will suffice.
3702 2018-12-26 16:59:21 During centuries XVII to XX Europe and USA (of Marx, Hegel, Goethe, Kant, Emerson, Adam Smith), took to the almost extinction of the whales by the utilization of their fat in the public lighting. Edison and the crude oil saved them. The Japanese kill whales to feed themselves.

The Sovereign Lord Has Promised to provide for those who grieve,to bestow on them a crown of beauty instead of ashes, the oil of gladness instead of mourning,& a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair.

Bring all the sick before the Lord.
3704 2018-12-26 16:58:59 You had ONE fucking job, #MCFC. Whilst we were getting over the loss of the great Sir Alex and are absolute garbage, with your millions you just had to stop THAT LOT winning the league. Take your oil money and get in the fucking sea please. #MUFC
3705 2018-12-26 16:58:59 My guess...

It all has to do with reports coming out of a planned Israeli ground invasion in Syria. This would be catastrophic for oil and the region. I'm angry that Israel is even thinking about it.
3706 2018-12-26 16:58:52 Oil remains an important bellwether of future growth. The sharp decline reflects concerns that the global economy is weakening,as well as surging U.S. crude output & falling stock prices.
3707 2018-12-26 16:58:50 No more oil leaks in the miata Merry Christmas to me
3708 2018-12-26 16:58:42 City lost again?! 

But I thought this was the greatest team that ever existed and Pep was the best manager of all time? Never forget City fans (all 8 of you), you're Blackburn without that oil money.
3709 2018-12-26 16:58:42 Petrol is now at 68.50. 
Credit goes to world market of crude oil. Narendra Modi is responsible only for price rise.

3721 2018-12-26 16:56:47 My take: 1st,not just Douglas. In MB NDP Gary Doer (1999-2009) tabled balanced budgets for 9 yrs. In SK after financial mismanagement by Grant Devine's Cons. NDP 
Roy Romanow (1991-2001) balanced the budget by 1994 & tabled 7 successive balanced budgets. MB/SK w/o AB's oil $

3724 2018-12-26 16:56:36 5% surge in oil prices today.
3725 2018-12-26 16:56:26 Give it up, man. Since 2012 there are a grand total of 3 Democrats who’ve been in the top 20 oil/gas recipients on the Open Secrets list in question. Given that context & that we have a climate crisis on our hands, it’s very fair to examine why Beto landed #2 on that list in 2018
3726 2018-12-26 16:56:22 One thing @realDonaldTrump ‘s election has done is identified those in the Republican party who really don’t subscribe to its conservative values. RINOs...That slimy oil slick that floats to the surface of the Republican waters.
3727 2018-12-26 16:56:19 Is it possible for state governments to import oil?
3728 2018-12-26 16:56:17 But they're more than happy to continue to use oil and gas. Food, clothing, shelter, all brought to you by oil.

3736 2018-12-26 16:55:31 That’s what happens when you’re an oil club and your fans are plastic
3737 2018-12-26 16:55:27 My biggest grievance is the oil rich Gulf States. Flaunting obscene opulence, yet take in almost no Islamic (especially) migrants. These are rich Islamic states! So much for the Muslim brotherhood!
3738 2018-12-26 16:55:15 They run on blood or gas/oil?

3740 2018-12-26 16:54:59 No kidding. There so "not worried" about plunging oil prices and the Russian economy tanking again 2015 style, that they're totally not making up bullshit about Ukraine preparing to use chemical weapons to distract Russian citizens from how shitty their lives are about to be.
3741 2018-12-26 16:54:57 The Oil Money Leaking goals left & right! They are ridiculously lame and ineffective!

3743 2018-12-26 16:54:44 Now I like gas at $2.50 a gallon but I gotta wonder about the overall global economy & its future growth with oil down over 40% since October
3744 2018-12-26 16:54:29 So if the United States of America has now taken the lead in controlling the pricing for oil in the world, what the F*** is the problem,OPEC and Putin will gouge the world in pricing, not too say that America isn't greedy too, I just trust American leaders to do right. For all.
3745 2018-12-26 16:54:26 As always oil is more important than be human, when there are alternatives, and there is no need for so much oil
3746 2018-12-26 16:54:14 I wonder how much of those high oil prices was the result of the dollar going off gold.

3752 2018-12-26 16:53:56 “Ethical” oil does mean,  environmental protection,  men & women treated equally,  coming from a country that respects & stands up for women’s, human & LGBTQ rights.

So yes, compared to where we get our foreign oil from, Canada has more “ethical” oil.
3753 2018-12-26 16:53:53 Let’s admit it. Through the years, there have been some very successful snake oil salesmen.  Trump is one of them. Using his celebrity and “charm” to fog his followers’ simple minds.

3756 2018-12-26 16:53:48 What oils do y’all use in your hot oil treatments?
3757 2018-12-26 16:53:44 Do you think @ABCWorldNews would do a story on @Tesla since it is also a #MadeInAmerica company? Or will the oil lobby not let them? Just more negative doubtful headlines about @elonmusk ?

3759 2018-12-26 16:53:33 You see why pochettino is getting all the praise and Wenger didn't, spurs, small club, relatively on a small budget, no signings, didn't moan about financial doping or oil money, just went about doing their business, to be ahead of city in December is astonishing.
3760 2018-12-26 16:53:27 The Wall Street Journal had an article on Christmas Eve talking about how oil companies are finding profits in other products which is limiting their worry about low gas prices WHICH makes me happy b/c cheap gas #oil #StockMarket #business #Gasoline #CrudeOil
3761 2018-12-26 16:53:24 City loosing their grip and loosing their heads. pep straight down the tunnel. you need to sack pep and get Richard dunne in. God knows what will happen when the oil runs out

3767 2018-12-26 16:53:00 The Fed did make the mistake of "monetizing" via money supply growth these price increases which made the problem worse.  You have to remember though in the 70's the correlation btw oil prices and CPI was .90, reflective of an industrial econ Today we are much more diverse

3777 2018-12-26 16:51:52 Sir couple of you came together few decades back to erect a world class organisation like Infosys, I am wondering if such association can be build up again to acquire oil fields abroad and secure country’s energy needs, though ideally companies like ONGC should lead the way.
3778 2018-12-26 16:51:52 Separation would happen naturally as the oil is more dense and would settle to the bottom.

3787 2018-12-26 16:50:53 All about its vacuity u mean. The closest thing to policy there is taxing oil company profits, but how that would be done isn’t clear. Then there’s milquetoast stuff u’d see on every Democrat’s website about investment & incentives in renewables. Then u get to the absurd promises
3788 2018-12-26 16:50:52 The ‘Oil City Torturers’ can’t be trusted. They’ve got no stomach for the fight. Pathetic .

3790 2018-12-26 16:50:40 Fed to raise rates again &looking to ruin markets & destroy Trumps credibility. I must be blind because I don’t see the economy on fire here. More recessionary if anything.

3820 2018-12-26 16:48:15 If they don't want to give her anything else and you've run the entire course of antibiotics, the only thing I know to recommend is eucalyptus oil in a diffuser, or to steam some in the house in a saucepan. It should help open her sinuses and soothe her cough.

3887 2018-12-26 16:42:40 While a vast majority of oil comes from Alberta & USA, Irving Oil has 173 gas stations in QC. While no Saudi oil is refined in Quebec, over 1/3 of Irving oil comes from the Middle East, so "not a drop" is inaccurate.

3892 2018-12-26 16:41:48 Yes. But it was when oil was low and nat gas was high. Do you think the ng suppliers in Alberta would have been happy? And once you use it you never give it up. Future populations would never get it back for ng.  So for once a look beyond four years might have been at play?

3941 2018-12-26 16:38:31 Today is apparently the day my brain is working well. Paid two bills completely off. Scheduled a tire change (has been desperately needed). Bought 1 new pair of shoes on SALE to replace my daily pair that are literally falling apart.
Gonna schedule a much needed oil change.
3942 2018-12-26 16:38:23 When oil changes get done at 5000 miles? These new cars are something else
3943 2018-12-26 16:38:19 I ve been ruminating about oil for many days, cause the depth of this initial wave 1 from 76.90 seems disproportionately elongated, I finally figured out the right count to justify the current move. Wti is on a double zig zag where 76.90 was wave x and recent low was wave a of y
3944 2018-12-26 16:38:01 also to prevent you from any relapse after your Baobab treatment I would suggest during this treatment to apply three times a week, once a day (noon) Neem oil .
These oils extremely rich in omega 9 and palmitic acid are non-greasy, odorless and very quickly absorbed by the skin

3949 2018-12-26 16:37:50 3. With that food logging app + accurate measurements of the food, you’ll learn what foods are calorie dense (oil/bread/snack foods) and make smarter trade offs & substitutions when you’re buying/making food.
3950 2018-12-26 16:37:48 Corn oil? Canola oil! Noooooooo! Ugh, y’all ignore the @TODAYshow’s outdated diet advice feature. Apparently @goodhousemag’s ‘dietician’ is stuck in the 90s. The saturated fats you should be eating are coconut oil, ghee, and even tallow.

3957 2018-12-26 16:36:50 The electric grid is rapidly transitioning to renewable resources. Hence the vertical structure of Tesla. You don’t see new oil power plants. They are 90% or more Wind/Solar. Don’t miss the future. Get with it.

3963 2018-12-26 16:36:24 Unfathomably ignorant to plan drilling programs that leave $billions of capital unemployed. The pit of negative NPV can never be filled.

Mean no more disrespect than you show me by preaching about lat-longs BUT:

How many oil & gas maps have you made or wells have you drilled?
3964 2018-12-26 16:36:22 FYI, oil is not a fossil. Look it up
3965 2018-12-26 16:36:20 Allah ko
3966 2018-12-26 16:36:14 So it's not just that we saved up & didn't lower taxes - the state enacted sevral laws and policies to ensure we did save up. The oil fund is intended to be for future pensions - it is actually officially called the state pension fund, but we just all call it the oil fund.

3973 2018-12-26 16:35:32 Omg oil burner sprung a leak water everywhere.  Fuck new boiler needed ffs no heating or water ffs
3974 2018-12-26 16:35:26 So as soon as i got to work my boss called and asked me to take the work vehicle to get an oil change now I’m here and they’re all talking about the car smoking and shit and I’m pretty sure it’s our work car awko
3975 2018-12-26 16:35:17 a girl came up to me and asked me when i was up at store today "hey you wanna come to my house and have some fun, i was just buying some stuff for the bedroom" in her cart there was motor oil, a pack of lighters, rope, multiple sets of throwing knives, an axe, and chicken
3976 2018-12-26 16:35:16 Driving down oil prices starves then military funds.
3977 2018-12-26 16:35:11 Seen that one, I was wondering who is buying oil from those private sellers and how are transactions made
3978 2018-12-26 16:35:07 Go bald, put baby oil on ur freshly mowed scalp & use it as a magic ball to predict our futures

3980 2018-12-26 16:34:57 I agree with  your assessment. Is there though a single oil company that has accepted this?

3986 2018-12-26 16:34:32 All of those tourists covered with oil.
3987 2018-12-26 16:34:24 My question with donations is, do campaigns have a blacklist of people who they check against every donation they receive? Sure these execs are well known but on the donation it would just say "works at acme oil company" right? Not "CEO of acme oil co."
3988 2018-12-26 16:34:20 Goaaaaalllll Pogba again
3989 2018-12-26 16:34:13 @lisamurkowski quick... without looking it up, where does the name Alaska come from? .... it means great land but I guess everyone’s opinion of that that means is different.  I’m sure the Aleuts were not referring to underground oil and gas however...
3990 2018-12-26 16:34:13 We are now a net exporter of oil, and we have long been an exporter of grain. I speculate the trade wars are really about grain more than anything. We could literally starve China if we cut them off.
3991 2018-12-26 16:34:04 Hey dummy they work in a state that employs a shit ton of oil & gas employees. So complaining that they receive money from their own constituents is a flawed argument at its very core.
3992 2018-12-26 16:34:00 I’m the same way Nick with the cost of heating oil so high. I’ve decided to be naughty all year for the coal too. (The left also makes it easy) Plus it’s great for grilling. Looks like you got enough there for a steak and few burgers. Enjoy.

3996 2018-12-26 16:33:46 We shouldn’t have ever been in Syria. Why we (allies) are there: to take oil fields, topple Assad & influence their civil war tho ppl like him, get involved in Russia/Syria route of gas pipeline being built there tho RU has military base there & can deal w/it. 1/2
3997 2018-12-26 16:33:44 i got an essential oil diffuser & i’m so excited 
3998 2018-12-26 16:33:42 Because she doesn't care about what the lobbyists want. She's fighting for her constituents not the $ from oil, NRA, big business. Ocasio-Cortez is a breath of fresh air. We the people need her fighting spirit.
3999 2018-12-26 16:33:32 OPEC sets oil prices. Supply & demand have nothing to do w/ oil prices . OPEC artificially raises & lowers supply. US/Canadian oil producers are pumping out oil as fast as they can produce it. Demand is up. Supply is down. Prices should be higher. They aren’t.
4000 2018-12-26 16:33:31 I don't want to be a great leader; I want to be a man who goes around with a little oil can and when he sees a breakdown, offers his help. To me, the man who does that is greater than any holy man in saffron-colored robes.
4001 2018-12-26 16:33:30 Could you get a whale to make a doll? The descendants of Americans who overcame for whale oil are really stupid and ignorant. Doll parts are by-products.
こんなことも理解できないなんて、本当にダボやなｗｗ
4002 2018-12-26 16:33:25 very encouraging...... what about his stance on oil as he is a texan after all. just want to know. we need to get off of fossil fuel dammit.
4003 2018-12-26 16:33:25 Slick Oil Ideas Nate 
4004 2018-12-26 16:33:17 That's not how oil forms geologically. 
Indeed we all use oil. It's not about using it, it's about how it's used, how much, how much money taxpayers should subsidize it's extraction, what costs are internalized, and whether taxpayers should pay for site cleanup post extraction
4005 2018-12-26 16:33:13 Every time I oil my scalp my forehead decides it wants its moment to shine too 
4006 2018-12-26 16:33:07 The prime minister directed that a detailed plan, in consultation with refineries, regarding the upgradation of existing facilities and export of surplus furnace oil should be worked out on priority basis.
4007 2018-12-26 16:32:46 Happy Birthday Taecyeon!! Add oil!! We always support you!
4008 2018-12-26 16:32:44 Norway did a whole bunch of things to get our growing oil fund: 1) Majorly tax foreign oil companies that operated in our seas 2) State set up its own oil company & takes a good share of the surplus 3) Limit how much oil revenue to used in budgets 4) Invest oil fund for long term

Add curry paste or powder as desired, let cook for a few minutes.  Add coconut milk and additional veggies as...
4025 2018-12-26 16:30:51 Yes, we don't have enough corruption in DNC as it is. We need more people who talk progressive but take money from big oil, pharma and sells out ordinary people to special interests. Exactly what we need.
4026 2018-12-26 16:30:48 Why do we always gotta sit around in our phones all the time? Like ma’am we’re in here getting our oil changed sitting in silence, why can’t I just tell you my whole life story, you tell me yours, and we can find some commonalities. Boom, softskills and friendship baby.

4038 2018-12-26 16:29:57 of course they are - more important to this formula than a figurehead willing to lie, are the masses craving the lies. 40% of our country willingly swallows snake oil and will fight as if cornered to continue to allow themselves to be lied to.

4075 2018-12-26 16:26:42 Venezuela are fighting the neo liberalism of the yanks, brits and most of the western world.  The yanks want regime change so they can steal the Venezuela's oil and keep the decaying Petrodollar alive.
4076 2018-12-26 16:26:39 Don't worry about the idiots. Most are from out west where they are suffering because world oil prices have plummeted.  They are out to attack anyone and anything, rather than accept that they have to move on - those heady days of $120 oil are not going to return.

4086 2018-12-26 16:25:21 Is it really backwards.. Gaslighting is kinda real..

hypothetically speaking, if Trump makes a deal with Putin.. Trump gets oil, hotels in Russia, or has debt with Putin.. And protects Russia from sanctions as a trade off..

Tells you Russia is helping with Syria - is that good?

4089 2018-12-26 16:25:05 You think oil goes lower? I'm thinking if the market continues to sell off, if the global bear is true, then oil does indeed drop. Thoughts?

4106 2018-12-26 16:23:05 .@fiatcares should review allowing @FMSuperstore to sell Fiats. After having things missing, break, or fall off the car after the last few oil changes, I listed my history of issues in a survey I received. FM response: u can’t prove it was us, we can’t change history if it was!
4107 2018-12-26 16:23:04 is even after Standard Oil had 90% of the oil market under its grasp in 1890). Now, Rockefeller was able to gain this much control over the market due to his innovations on the relatively new market that was oil, while competitors at the time were being inefficient.
4108 2018-12-26 16:22:57 My Spanish sister-in-law just referred to red wine as ‘reality oil’ and I’m adopting that one for life.

4115 2018-12-26 16:22:22 what really bothers me is that neither @BBCWorld nor @France24_fr seem to understand oil prices are still much higher than when Chavez got elected in 1998 and living standards now are a fraction of what they were in the darkest hours of the 4th Republic
4116 2018-12-26 16:22:11 At least it's only 5. I've gone to get oil changes right at a shop opening time and gotten stuck in lines 15 deep. Hopefully 5 won't take too long.
4117 2018-12-26 16:22:08 This is exactly what happened with our car!! It guzzled oil for a year. We had a mechanic that we trusted replace chain. Dealerships always mark up their prices and as standard practice add on as much “extra repairs” as possible. We only go to them while car is under warranty.
4118 2018-12-26 16:22:08 How hard is it to understand, estab corp dems are not your friends, they maybe support some social reforms, but they would never back smth like a green new deal if they can do smth about it,rather have the old climate change committee that gets money from the oil industry

4171 2018-12-26 16:17:25 I’d recommend matte makeup to people with genuine oily skin not just t zone oily but all over enlarged pores/more susceptible to breakouts/all over oil skin. Matte is good for people who need to control over production of oil.

4173 2018-12-26 16:17:22 Oil companies could not care less about spreading a “counter narrative”. Oil demand increases every year, nothing is yet available to replace it and a carbon tax will simply be passed on to consumers. Climate alarmism is where the big money is.

4175 2018-12-26 16:17:07 I literally hate being a woman getting her oil changed 
4176 2018-12-26 16:17:03 Kaso ang lagkit ng oil sa katawan
4177 2018-12-26 16:17:02 That’s great,now we have to ask ourselves if we can trust Neo-Libs that took corrupt oil money in the first place...#YellowVestsUSA #Resist #NoDapl
4178 2018-12-26 16:16:56 Frontline's merchants of cool needs to be required watching these days. Lightyears ahead of its time
4179 2018-12-26 16:16:51 Those who would give up essential NEW POTATOES, to purchase a little temporary Java, deserve neither Oil & Energy nor Sao Tome & Principe.
4180 2018-12-26 16:16:47 Right but they collapsed in the 2H like this year. And production didn’t keep rising but . . . It grew by 1mmbbls !!! That was a Huge rise. 
I think oil bounces but is headed into the mid30’s before it really finds a bottom.
4181 2018-12-26 16:16:44 Many people seem to confuse deflation, where prices decline, with disinflation, where the rate of inflation declines. The US is not anywhere near a deflationary environment though the decline in commodity prices, particularly oil, will cause disinflation.
4182 2018-12-26 16:16:29 Seriously, I'm a virgin! Where do you think they get virgin olive oil?
4183 2018-12-26 16:16:29 He should also have not taken money from Oil and Gas employees for over $200.  The FEC requires people to provide their employer information. He could have refunded all those transactions.
4184 2018-12-26 16:16:18 Merry Christmas Brenna.
You were (not we're, or where) probably burning the midnight oil too, (not to or two), if we all know (not no) you...


4185 2018-12-26 16:16:00 Bedrocan oil, Tilray oil, Epidiolex. If the cannabinoid profile and bioavailability is identical then there is hard to see a difference...
4186 2018-12-26 16:15:50 There are seven gallons of oil in every tire, and far more oil in the myriad plastic panels, ducting, bumpers, wiring, batteries, seats, etc. Electric cars don’t wean us off oil, and autonomous cars don’t do jack. The human machine can locomote. We can walk. Only positive impacts

She discovered a lady stealing electric, there was a scuffle, $1.00 fine "cuz she didn't lose her hat." #WhereIGetItFrom

4191 2018-12-26 16:15:16 Psalm 23:5 New International Version (NIV)

4192 2018-12-26 16:14:59 So I cooked mee goreng for the first time ever it didn’t taste like the one I always have back home but I decided to give it some Chinese taste so I added some sesame oil and sprinkled some sesame seed and voila, Jay’s Chinese Style Fried Noodles hehehehhehe
4193 2018-12-26 16:14:54 And coal and oil companies have been going up in value.
4194 2018-12-26 16:14:06 Gross.  I use butter or non stick spray not straight up cooking oil. Yuck!  Or maybe even some bacon grease.  Lol dammit now I want bacon.
4195 2018-12-26 16:14:04 Right now deflation is mild but thematically it has been asserting itself a little more strongly since 2000 with each economic downturn, oil is a good example, so is the action on the long end of the rate curve. Central bankers are finding out how little control they really have.
4196 2018-12-26 16:13:55 Damnnn. You know all the secrets. I wanna try those little bath oil thingamajigs.
4197 2018-12-26 16:13:55 Lmao  maybe they work in the oil fields your first move should always be forward

4208 2018-12-26 16:12:26 America has achieved energy independence and Ohio is at the center of it. Thank you @RepBillJohnson for your leadership. I saw TX boom with oil in the early 80s. Looking forward to the same crazy boom in Ohio with LNG as we begin exporting it to the world.

4211 2018-12-26 16:12:04 No it does not! Burying that story because "oil." Disgusting!
4212 2018-12-26 16:11:57 Damn I gotta go for oil change at 1130 I don’t wanna get up.
4213 2018-12-26 16:11:45 “when should I expect my car to be ready, with an oil change, new tire, and rotation?” “We’ll call you when it’s ready.” “But...when will that be?” “We’ll call you.” “...” “definitely before, like, the end of the day.” THAT’S THE MOST SPECIFIC YOU CAN GET?!
4214 2018-12-26 16:11:40 Donations have a significant effect if she's defending their presence on a panel regulating that industry And, do oil gas companies have vested interest in "energy and natural resources?" If not, why are we giving away national park space to frackers & drillers?

By these two models, we have managed to rob some oil to our global economic wheel and drive for a while. But again, we have plunged in another crisis

4226 2018-12-26 16:10:34 There is no possible explanation showing the temperature increases over the last 100 years except AGW. If anyone came up with an alternative then they would be rich. Coal and oil companies would skyrocket in value.
Why is there not ONE article explaining a different answer?

4239 2018-12-26 16:07:37 1) oil is lower, 2) financial conditions have materially changed, 3) we're probably through the worst of the freight jump, 4) lower GDP growth quarters ahead. The balance of risks has changed if nothing else.
4240 2018-12-26 16:07:35 In Malaysia, cheap food [in eateries. I'm not talking about home cooked meals] are usually less healthy, because meat and vegetables are relatively pricier than cheap cooking oil and carbs. I also think it's a lack of education and awareness. 
4241 2018-12-26 16:07:30 In 1939, Texaco became one of the first oil companies to introduce a "Registered Rest Room" program to ensure that restroom facilities at all Texaco stations nationwide maintained a standard level of cleanliness to the motoring public.

4246 2018-12-26 16:06:59 2/ I don't think the analogy to crude oil makes sense for a bunch of reasons, this is just one.  If I buy crude oil from an oil Barron, my purchase is probably not based on the idea that the asset will derive its value from future work by the Barron.

4290 2018-12-26 16:01:16 Does this include those employed by fossil fuel industries? For instance, I’m a petroleum engineer but have donated to my congressman @RepBetoORourke @BetoORourke. He has been criticized for receiving oil/gas donations, but it is a huge industry in Texas.

4306 2018-12-26 15:59:35 My Christmas present from my dad was an oil change & I’m not mad about it 
4307 2018-12-26 15:59:30 Some oil companies are the biggest investors into wind and solar.....   look at what she’ll just paid to lease wind farm water off the coast of New England.
4308 2018-12-26 15:59:27 The Us needs more from isis than turkey, instability in the region justify the US presence and that's what the US is looking for fight over that precious OIL an the oil is owned by isis funders btw, the perfect circle

4312 2018-12-26 15:59:14 @FrankFigliuzzi1 @JoyceWhiteVance 
Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays and Buon Natale to our favorite brilliant minds! 
I made a feast in your honor 
Today we move onto cubanelle peppers fried in olive oil and eating all the stuffed shells and torrone that’s left.

4314 2018-12-26 15:58:52 Well that is still unwritten history but oil price declines should rather lead to a energy boost in global consumption. But the school books these days...

BJP govt under PM Modi has inaugurated the Paradip Oil Refinery & laid the foundation of Paradip- Hyderabad pipeline of Indian Oil Corp which will not only strengthen Odisha’s energy sector but will also boost employment & investment in the region

4320 2018-12-26 15:57:50 Made an appointment for an oil change tomorrow about 3 weeks ago. But after talking to my granny, I'm finna hit a valvoline and call it a day.
4321 2018-12-26 15:57:50 Not sure but many oil stocks trade below replacement cost of the equipment. $XES
4322 2018-12-26 15:57:41 Cara Oil gue baru beli trus barusan jatoh. Ini hati rasanya udah begini. Gimana kalo belinya Sunday Riley Luna trus jatoh nyerep di kasur ya
4323 2018-12-26 15:57:40 So when a train derails, the response is immediate. When a pipeline leaks, its leaks for months before anyone even notices.

Comparing how dirty someone's oil is like saying my shit smells less than your shit

And can we get @LisaRaitt in on the Lac Megantic convo?

4327 2018-12-26 15:57:35 In the #2019Budget presented by @MBuhari, over N300bn was added for oil subsidy. Recall that Buhari once said that "...if anybody says he is subsidizing anything he's a fraud."

Buhari is a fraud...

4329 2018-12-26 15:57:33 It changes everything. It makes Sirota's manicured squee about him being No. 2 in oil contributions into decontextualized, dishonest horseshit. A phrase that means nothing when actually evaluated against the all voters. And worse, he omits obvious: That it's not industry money.
4330 2018-12-26 15:57:32 เป็นคนไม่ค่อยอินกับการปาร์ตี้ หรืออยู่กับคนเยอะๆ เพราะชอบอยู่คนเดียวหรือนัดกันแค่2-3คนมากกว่า มันก็สนุกนะแต่สนุกแบบแกนๆ ไม่ค่อยได้คุยอะไรถ้าคุยก็กับคนข้างๆแค่นั้น ก้มหน้ากินไม่ก็กดมือถือ 555
4331 2018-12-26 15:57:21 แงๆๆๆๆ lapis oilดีมากๆๆๆๆๆ ลืมเอามาบ้านด้วย
4332 2018-12-26 15:57:11 Ok sure but “energy and natural resoures” is very broad and inclusive of many things (ie fisheries, wildlife mgmt, etc) 

She has only revived $2000 from oil and gas interests. Glad she’s not taking any more but in total it’s pretty rather minor. More symbolic if anything.
4333 2018-12-26 15:57:03 Oil and credit looking non-life threatening today (so far) $SPX $VIX
4334 2018-12-26 15:56:49 Lizzo.  Coconut Oil got me thru 2018
4335 2018-12-26 15:56:39 I really prefer metric but when it comes to my oil changes and really anything car or equipment fluid I like having it using an even number of the units sold locally.   

This oil change I was slightly on the high side after the oil filter filled.  Still within the marks
4336 2018-12-26 15:56:35 Merry Christmas 
4337 2018-12-26 15:56:33 This is a very good example of propaganda at work.

The analysis of Beto’s record says that he accepted 0.5% of his total money from oil *workers*, denied all corporate money and all PAC money.

This then got boiled down thru the tribe to “big money ties.”

Absolute horseshit.
4338 2018-12-26 15:56:32 The GOP is too militaristic. They use our military as pwns in their games to acquire and protect resources, such as oil. If they were better people, they'd develop better foreign policies that don't create friction to the point of violence. Be better, GOP.
4339 2018-12-26 15:56:25 Appreciate it. Understand your intentions but someone somewhere in the process oversold the product and it’s your brand on it. Next time when/if I buy my oil from you, I will reach out. I’m not sure if I’ll risk $30+tax again tho. Just being honest. Thanks for reaching out.
4340 2018-12-26 15:56:12 Next thing I know, neighbour knocking door accusing me of taking pics of him  Hes no oil painting I can tell you that! 
4341 2018-12-26 15:55:48 It's nice how you don't look at all the pros & cons of an industry, just pick the cons of solar & don't meantion the cons of oil, gas, coal & nuclear.  If you could choose only 1 system what would it be?  Wind, Oil or_______________? or a mix______?
4342 2018-12-26 15:55:44 Through oil faster, getting four oil changes within six months. I stopped going six months after buying my car, and my oil changes have since calmed down and my oil has lasted longer. And when I tried to file a complaint to GM, they brushed me aside and I have no idea if it’s
4343 2018-12-26 15:55:36 Trump vs Beto is a choice between:
A) someone who's going to pretend about global warming doesn't exist
B) someone who's going to talk big on global warming, while giving a lot of tax money to his big oil donors and crushing their green competition
4344 2018-12-26 15:55:24 And why do say I've only followed him for 6 days? If he posted that oil industry donor list that recently, I apologize because I feel like it's been at least a couple weeks. And I don't randomly follow journalists whom I do not respect. I live for good investigativr journalism!

4353 2018-12-26 15:54:08 Because my car burns oil faster than it should, leading to a timing chain issue, but if it’s anything less than a quart every 1k miles, it’s fine. But GM won’t cover any of it, and I’m not leaving my car with people I don’t trust, when the oil they use on my car makes my car burn

4357 2018-12-26 15:53:55 I have never felt so #independent until this morning when I brought my car in for an oil change and tire rotation without a male present to help me 
4358 2018-12-26 15:53:49 Uh... there’s no oil to ban lol but ok...
4359 2018-12-26 15:53:48 It’s all about olive oil tell her
4360 2018-12-26 15:53:46 Oil change then getting my nail fixed 
4361 2018-12-26 15:53:42 That'd be Getty who taught Saudis in the '40s how to extract oil, made a deal & a Dock from whence to ship the oil..in container ships that he invented..

Same time HenryFord's plans for a working model of soy based car & fuel were "lost". 

The rest, as they say, is history.
4362 2018-12-26 15:53:40 My car is at -230 miles. I reallllllly need to get that oil change.

4391 2018-12-26 15:51:17 I've seen other recipes that add oil and sugar, but it's not needed, wheaten goes great with smoked salmon and cheese. Not at same time though 
4392 2018-12-26 15:51:03 Typical American heroism...always saying they will stay and fight. You need other countries in order to stay as safe as possible. But okay, then Europe should never help the US again when they have gotten themselves into another oil war.
4393 2018-12-26 15:51:03 i just can't understand the divergence between oil & spooz
4394 2018-12-26 15:50:46 Aku baru kelar neh, gile 40 menit-an sambil bengong2 sm urutannya. Itupun skip cleansing oil, maskeran, eye cream, sunblock (kan malem y). Ga sanggup tiap hari 
4395 2018-12-26 15:50:41 The reason state governments are so hard up for musk's shitty car tunnel is it still gets people buying cars and burning oil for those cars.
4396 2018-12-26 15:50:31 The problem is when Sirota and others say- campaign donations from people in the oil industry = Beto is a corrupt tool of the fossil fuels industry. Sirota & others ran that same game on Clinton. It’s an uncalled for assumption and a smear.
4397 2018-12-26 15:50:29 Oh Yeah! My hired mechanic is working on my car giving it a oil change. Thank You Your Mechanic!

4402 2018-12-26 15:50:02 Weidel! Merz! 
Why is Goldman Sachs talking about reducing carbon in the oil companies? 
Foolish! 
We want to divest from the oil companies, not for these companies to keep working. 
How will you use money in hell?

4407 2018-12-26 15:49:42 Oil price is down and @cnn is unhappy about it. You know who is happy oil is down?  The millions of rural Americans who now drive 10-20,000 miles more a year because our manufacturing base is gone.  Get out of the city and you might understand why you are wrong.
4408 2018-12-26 15:49:41  ok, veg oil...I can imagine the taste now, thanks...I know aiskrim goreng but not biskut goreng
4409 2018-12-26 15:49:40 When the oil sands project was started, the Canadian public was promised that the damage to the local environment could be restored. In other words scrape off the foliage, take the tar sand and restore the foliage. Time to start the restoration.

4426 2018-12-26 15:47:54 The oil and gas does not belong to Scotland, it belongs to the oil companies that extract it. The revenue comes from licenses and tax on profits.

4428 2018-12-26 15:47:45 Major benchmarks for crude oil prices have lost about 40 percent of their value in just under three months.Croft and other analysts now see signs of weakening global demand growth as the fuel for continued selling in the oil market.

4431 2018-12-26 15:47:26 Totally agree.  I got Exxon stock as a birthday present many years ago.  I donated to Beto.  Now these clowns will try to say Beto's in the pocket of the oil and gas industry!  I'm starting to believe there really is a propaganda war launched by the Bernies.  Geez.
4432 2018-12-26 15:47:17 @Investeraren well it has only started so far right? With the oil price dropping I think it will be even worse before up...
4433 2018-12-26 15:46:38 The true story to tell is about how this crisis was deliberately orchestrated by criminal oil men determined to put their profits before the welfare of humanity. An ongoing battle of evil vs good, the most compelling kind of story there is.

4439 2018-12-26 15:46:15 The bjp-nda government policies 1)demonitisation 2) increasing oil ,gas prices 3) exploitation of consumers by private cellular companies (tariff) 4)cable tariff are make TRAI corrupted activities promoted ...Etc are mainly created anti-bjp in people.
4440 2018-12-26 15:46:09 พวกเขาคงชินกับการเล่นละเจ็บตัวอ่ะ แต่ไม่คิดไงว่าคนอื่นไม่เหมือนกัน เข้าใจแหละโมเม้นขำๆ แต่ช่วยเออ เป็นห่วงกันหน่อยเนอะ แต่ดันถ่ายคลิปต่อเพราะต้องการคอนเทนต์ เห้อ
4441 2018-12-26 15:46:01 All the Capital city in Niger delta do not have oil but also depend on Oil communities.
my problem is how governors at the capital cities swallowed all the Oil Revenue coming in and leave the Oil producing communities are left in ruins.
4442 2018-12-26 15:45:58 Ok, so no hate comments pls. I made a smoothie yesterday w/ a little castor oil to try to move labor along & it DID cause painful & strong contractions but what amazes me is that it cleared out my system & I no longer have bad pelvic pain??! 
4443 2018-12-26 15:45:50 Plunging oil prices show the market is worried about a recession in 2019, says analyst.
The ongoing plunge in oil prices shows that the market is worried about a recession in 2019, says Helima Croft, head of global commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets.
4444 2018-12-26 15:45:42 It’s gilded onto wood in the same way that most oil painting frames were. Very little gold is used in the process.
4445 2018-12-26 15:45:40 The only thing I’ve figured out through all this, over the years is plastic is made from oil. So who is making the money from all this plastic. Follow the money back to its origins.
4446 2018-12-26 15:45:35 Oil tweet
4447 2018-12-26 15:45:33 すくねえ…
4448 2018-12-26 15:45:29 Oklahoma in April, EVERYONE supported teachers in the walkout. Nov. Governors election comes, we vote a guy that didn't & won't do shit for teachers but is pro oil and gas. That's why.
4449 2018-12-26 15:45:29 Happy Migas to me (and all my Spanish pals) today. See you soon for oil fried breadcrumbs and council provided wine 
4450 2018-12-26 15:45:18 I highly doubt prices are going back up soon.  US about to flood market with oil in 2019 as Texas pipelines bring a lot more oil to market.  
All the more reason all the worry about tariffs is misplaced.
4451 2018-12-26 15:45:13 dangerous for markets to keep dropping, Trump with his deranged mind, will figure a war will get economy perking again, oil as well, so again with his warped deranged mind he will start looking for a war thinking this will unify the country....
4452 2018-12-26 15:45:13 I can vouche that @malcolmchaisso1 can change oil and tires. he did it for me once
4453 2018-12-26 15:45:12 I'll take another clear shot for each works after I put vanish oil in it
4454 2018-12-26 15:45:01 Snake oil salesmen or snake oil buyers? Easy answer. Happy New Year, Chip!!!! You’re my drive home always.
4455 2018-12-26 15:45:00 Oil diffusers >>>
4456 2018-12-26 15:44:56 One thing for certain is that when oil actually does bottom, most will say to sell any rally and that lower lows are coming. The bears are loudest at the low.
4457 2018-12-26 15:44:52 The ass look so much better wit baby oil on it
4458 2018-12-26 15:44:51 AM I THE ONLY PERSON THAT GETS ACNE FROM THEIR BFS BEARD OIL?! Maybe if I get him this... I will not have weird red areas on my chest 
4459 2018-12-26 15:44:45 You finally going to the oil field?
4460 2018-12-26 15:44:32 Ameen
4461 2018-12-26 15:44:28 The tax breaks are for the Big money industries that will gobble up small to medium size businesses, essentially crushing them, Venezuela is a single product economy, OIL, terrible comparison, the US has many diverse industries. Why not compare the Nordic Countries?
4462 2018-12-26 15:44:25 Kemain ajak dinner pastu senyap, kemain kau argan oil bagai.

Pantat ye perangai.
4463 2018-12-26 15:44:25 Daniel don’t buy the snake oil remedy , it doesn’t work.
4464 2018-12-26 15:44:10 it was amazingly fun to drive but everything cost a fortune.  I remember just the oil filter alone at Napa was $30.  She's got a Civic now and loves the fact that it always works and is cheap to keep, but still brings up that MINI on occasion.

4467 2018-12-26 15:44:03 So yesterday was Christmas and no one thought to get you a hot oil treatment.  I'm starting to think no one likes you

4469 2018-12-26 15:43:45 Sorry, my day off became errand day when you told me you needed an oil change and had a dentist appointment in the middle of the day
4470 2018-12-26 15:43:40 Makkkk. Kita baru beli argan oil lepas Mak cakap Mak pakai argan oil. Pakai time rambut basah ke? Pakai part kulit kepala saja, atau hujung rambut saja atau semua??
4471 2018-12-26 15:43:31 Now, do you or do you not support the PM importing Millions of Barrels of Unethical Oil from SA Yearly? That was the point of my original post, It seems like you are anti-oil, have you quit using every item made from it? Why Not?
4472 2018-12-26 15:43:16 おすしたべたー！やったー！
4473 2018-12-26 15:43:10 Dabar ka khesh hair oil lagao 
4474 2018-12-26 15:43:05 All part of Nigeria can not all have oil or mineral resource. That is why we depend on each other.
majority of LGA in Niger Delta do not have oil well but all DEPEND on oil communities.
we Local govt in Nigeria and also State govt and them Federal govt.
4475 2018-12-26 15:42:59 Why you big shawds always smelling like cooking oil.......
4476 2018-12-26 15:42:53 Never drinking castor oil again!
4477 2018-12-26 15:42:48 Considering the fact that volcanoes are erupting left and right and spewing ash into the atmosphere, on top of a Grand Solar Minimum, we're lucky we have oil, natural gas and coal. The coming years will be colder and energy independence will be crucial for our very survival.
4478 2018-12-26 15:42:43 The Christopher Steele Russian Dossier on @realDonaldTrump implied that Trump was offered 19% from the sale of Rosneft a Russian oil company and now Trump is lifting the sanctions if true that’s TREASON #TrumpLiftsSanctions
4479 2018-12-26 15:42:29 Bitcoin is the link between storing value using thermodynamics.

Oil thermodynamics from the Sun
Gold created by 2 Suns

Electricity created by thermodynamics.

Mining efficiency comes from thermodynamics, consensus agrees the Network's value.

Life and value = thermodynamics.
4480 2018-12-26 15:42:28 Doing a little refresher course in php while waiting for my car to finish the oil change.
4481 2018-12-26 15:42:27 I use @NaturesUltra CBD Oil + it works for me Don’t give up. Find your solution
4482 2018-12-26 15:42:24 Does the food have a crunch w/o the oil?
4483 2018-12-26 15:42:21 Oil money u actually don’t deserve anything u just got lucky with your owners
4484 2018-12-26 15:42:21 We need whale oil for lamps....
4485 2018-12-26 15:42:13 your choices include someone who ALREADY LOST, a terrible, corrupt HUD secretary, a groper, a Wall St shill, an avatar of mass incarceration, and at least two oil company servants. jesus.

4490 2018-12-26 15:41:34 Yall remember when knk were making fake food commercials and inseong pretended to be a chicken who jumped into boiling oil. Who’s man?
4491 2018-12-26 15:41:11 Oh the oil companies want that pipeline very much but I agree 100% about the shame surrounding the living conditions of many 1st Nations peoples!!! 
4492 2018-12-26 15:41:10 My mom bought me six containers of oil absorbing sheets for Christmas. Was she being nice or trying to tell me something?
4493 2018-12-26 15:41:08 I don't know the kind of oil Ceec carries ooo....

From haters to lovers this is just the way she keeps confusing them.

Neither you Stan love her die or you die being her hater.

Just d way every1 wants to know her next move then in bbn still happening in reality

#BBNaija
4494 2018-12-26 15:40:58 Nah, a cheaper way to combat climate change would be to send big oil's mega-investors, boardrooms, and their paid politicians and 'scientists' to Pluto. Actually, Titan is less dV & has hydrocarbons they'd love it here.
4495 2018-12-26 15:40:56 But wait David, they need whale oil for their lamps to light up their homes.  The Japanese don't have electricity yet.  And whale blubber soup.....yummmm!
4496 2018-12-26 15:40:54 Oil is the blood that runs the American anatomy. Saudis are literally the strings that puppet OPEC. You don't poison the well you drink from.
4497 2018-12-26 15:40:48 As with every other invention on earth, the internet has its pros and cons. The thing is, there are many negative sides to it than the good sides. 

"when there's a tiny oil stain on a white shirt, the whole shirt becomes dirty"

Let's actually be grateful for Mark Zuckerberg,...
4498 2018-12-26 15:40:44 Something tells me there will be. And they will have a lot to do with oil.
4499 2018-12-26 15:40:40 A questn  to all,#our celebraties have lotz of money,but after tat they knew tat their fan's/public use to always focus their activities then why they cant advertise or make add on or behalf of our country welfare but,They always use to make (add.) like on oil, biscuts deo,gutka?
4500 2018-12-26 15:40:31 Yes actually. Where I work at an oil refinery, support personnel needed for the long run but that are not essential to everyday production operations are listed as non-essential. You can operate temporarily without them, but need them in the long run.
4501 2018-12-26 15:40:20 WHALE OIL BEEF HOOKED!! (in an Irish accent)
4502 2018-12-26 15:40:20 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Pittsburgh sleeps.
4503 2018-12-26 15:40:19 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Pittsburgh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
4504 2018-12-26 15:40:15 Global conspiracy! Global conspiracy!! Global conspiracy!!! As the @UN conspired with Nigerian government to deprive BIAFRANS their rights to exist as a people even when they know that water and oil can never mix. Christians and Muslims can never live peacefully in one country.
4505 2018-12-26 15:40:15 Life is full of ups and downs for all Homo sapiens. Christians are not immune to the realities of life. Prayer, fasting, tithes, offerings, night vigils, deliverance service, anointing oil and positive confession cannot stop these realities.
4506 2018-12-26 15:40:09 Endless oil story
4507 2018-12-26 15:40:03 Honestly, you need only look right here at twitter's "analytics" page. The kind of blatantly made up moon bullshit that would make a snake oil hawker weep with envy
4508 2018-12-26 15:39:48 กราบบัดดี้ที่ซื้อหนังสือให้ คือ ชอบบบบ ลดรายจ่ายในการซื้อหนังสือไปอีก 1 เล่ม เย้ :)
4509 2018-12-26 15:39:48 we don't have a Budget for 2019.
Will only have an appropriation Bill.
Assumption ,projection or expectation or Hope as you wish to call it.
the only Issue we have is that is all base on assumption. Nigeria on its own can not fix oil price.
4510 2018-12-26 15:39:43 JUST said this. No music, no oil lol keep that shit away I want the raw real shit.
4511 2018-12-26 15:39:41 What you're seeing is actually a mixture of oil and crumbs that can sometimes form during packaging and it is not peanut based. Please DM us the UPC, expiration date with the letters & numbers that follow.
4512 2018-12-26 15:39:36 Did you hear about the massive oil spill in Northern Alberta? Happened 65 Million years ago and Companies in Alberta have been working 24/7 for years now to clean it up. See, anyone can spin a narrative. Get off of your petroleum based hate because you use items with it, everyday
4513 2018-12-26 15:39:34 Bruce Lee once said that every time Trump opens his mouth, a tibetan monch writes a song about #love
4514 2018-12-26 15:39:32 Beat city last year check 

5 times check 

Never reached a final check 

At least we got to the final check 

All we need now is empty seats and oil money for a bingo
4515 2018-12-26 15:39:24 trust, believe, n use coconut oil sis 
4516 2018-12-26 15:39:24 just saw someone tweet $XOM price target in the $30s   I'd say #BuyFear in the oil sector.   Lets revisit this mid Jan $XOP $XES $CRC $CDEV
4517 2018-12-26 15:39:21 It’s really weird bc I’ve had mine for 8 years and they still look really good... (I oil mine once a week)
4518 2018-12-26 15:39:19 This "I pledge not to take fossil fuel donations" bit is just an excuse to pile on Beto because he took contributions from people who work in Oil/Gas, but in Texas, those are the largest employers. Peeps take the jobs available to them. The Bernie "woke" crowd is on my last nerve
4519 2018-12-26 15:39:08 Also you can make oil in various forms from stems
4520 2018-12-26 15:38:48 ศอก 2 ข้าง กับหลังเอวอ่ะ ตรงหลังเอวนี่หนักสุดแผลใหญ่เลย เดี๋ยวพน.คลิปออกมึงคงเห็น แต่ของจริงมันดูแย่กว่าในคลิปอ่ะ รู้สึกแย่สัส

了解！どんどん絡も！( ᐛ )و
4523 2018-12-26 15:38:31 This is a hugely over-simplistic interpretation, when banks get given oil futures they don’t just sit on enormous long delta positions, they trade out of them and spread risk with the wider market. More than just banks/producers in the oil market
4524 2018-12-26 15:38:29 at this stage it's pretty clear to me this isn't abt any sort of funny mentals just abt liquidation and redemption just like in oil.
4525 2018-12-26 15:38:26 Let’s do the math together. So roughly 15% of energy needed comes from all 3, wind, solar, hydro.  How much of a % does it take to make up energy that comes from coal, oil, natural gas? Did you say 85%? Good for you!
4526 2018-12-26 15:38:24 A Pets New Years resolution starts with the owner & pet lover. Proper food & amount. Walking or Dog Park, overall health program. For me 4 drops of CBD Oil per day ( Hemp Oil). Healthy Pets live longer. Bear our little Terrier lived to be 18 & all good years. Picture with Lyndea
4527 2018-12-26 15:38:18 Bestnya sundal cuci rambut pakai air suam, pakaikan mask then lap2 bukan sental pakai towel. Apply argan oil dan biarkan air dry. Nasiblah dah pendek rambutnya. Kalau dulu paras hips tu, mak ikut mood ya sundal nak buat semua ni. Lenguh tangan nak apply segala bahan.
4528 2018-12-26 15:38:10 The reason Venezuela fell apart is the countries social services were dependent on oil profits. When oil dropped they dropped. People are eating zoo animals in the most fertile year round farming land on earth. Because the government owns the land.
4529 2018-12-26 15:37:43 Baru sempet baca-baca berita tentang tsunami krakatau. Langsung ciut dan teringat kalo saya ini bukan apa2. Kalau sudah kehendak Allah, tsunami tanpa gempa pun bisa terjadi
4530 2018-12-26 15:37:33 Woulda picked Evan Bouchard, he been drafted by MY Oil and wouldn’t be all weepy and emo and shit over being named captain. SMH #WORLDJUNIORSTOURNAMENT #GOCANADAGO 
4531 2018-12-26 15:37:23 That was at one point(pre oil). Not now.
4532 2018-12-26 15:37:07 Into them, furthering the hypothesis!

Similarly with hot peppers I think because the oil becomes “hot” it overrides the flavour & becomes heat instead of its own bouquet, which is why bell draws my ire, not hot peppers as much.
4533 2018-12-26 15:37:02 Big Oil day is over
4534 2018-12-26 15:37:01 It was from *executives* in the oil and gas industry, and Beto pledged that he would not take them if they were over $200.
4535 2018-12-26 15:37:01 めっちゃ吹きましたwwwwww
4536 2018-12-26 15:37:01 Put black Jamaican castor oil on dat
4537 2018-12-26 15:37:01 Add oil guys
4538 2018-12-26 15:36:59 Ask Lawrence why he took $70k a month to lobby for Peabody Energy. He is just a corrupt hack on the take with oil money. Of course he loves Beto.
4539 2018-12-26 15:36:52 Relaxing oil.
4540 2018-12-26 15:36:44 He use to recite fr Malam Buhari Ya'qub during Tafseer, may Allah forgive his soul.
4541 2018-12-26 15:36:42 I have a couple of oil stains on a new poly-blend tablecloth—and no pre-wash treatment products in the house. Anyone have a good #stainremovalhack to get the oil stains out? (Pretty sure it's salad dressing.)
4542 2018-12-26 15:36:35 Always hated the smell of black seed oil but I kinda like it now
4543 2018-12-26 15:36:12 There is an indescribable sadness in the air tonight, Karachi. @abidifactor - his life cut short by so many years.

4545 2018-12-26 15:35:45 Gold at $1280 (+0.7%). 
Platinum (+1.5%) palladium (+0.4%) and copper (+1.3%) all up quite strongly.
Brent oil up 2.5% to $51.70 as prices recover from the Xmas eve slump.
4546 2018-12-26 15:35:44 Where in my statement did I even come close to saying corporate welfare for oil companies?
4547 2018-12-26 15:35:42 .BarbequeNation I had my friend Catherine exam. I burned oil for entire year. Now i need to party hard. I have earned it…
4548 2018-12-26 15:35:37 You stand in a wallpapered room, which is nearly empty but for an oil lamp sitting on a dinner table.
4549 2018-12-26 15:35:27 .@NoFossilBanks Please consider putting CIBC on your naughty list for their recent announcement that they would move their investor's conference out of any city that asks oil companies to cover #climatechange costs. @CIBC #cdnbiz #cdnpoli
4550 2018-12-26 15:35:18 natgas 3.34 to close short and go long. big oil tucked in range 41.50/50.80, sp all over the place but needs above 2380 for rally, you know the lower levels, nosty 2300/2200

Everybody talks a grand story…but life with Crude Oil is far better than life without.
Be sweet if epic hypocrisy could power political campaigns!

4559 2018-12-26 15:34:43 and...don’t forget provincial and federal governments, while bowing to foreign “environmentalists” have virtually crippled our oil and gas industries. Therefore badly needed revenue is not there to support crucial things like healthcare.
4560 2018-12-26 15:34:41 Forget 1 day.  Let us men leave for more like 365 days and then return to find you without electricty, oil, new housing, pot hole filled roads and bridges, buildings on fire, no farm grown food or fish from the deep seas, cars broken down, homes falling apart, etc, etc, etc
4561 2018-12-26 15:34:39 Our over dependence on fossil fuel is a major problem. Oil and Gas is a curse rather than a blessing to Nigeria #Resourcecurse. Renewable energy is the way forward, and the sooner we embrace it, the better for us.
4562 2018-12-26 15:34:39 Doing an oil change on my 2016.5 cruze is a bit of a pain. 

The Saab and Cobalt from before spoiled me.  

Why is it a pain. Oil filter is under the car and pointing up. Ok, not odd but compared to the other 2 a pain and a mess.  

The big issue is the 4L system. Not quarts. Ugh
4563 2018-12-26 15:34:35 Supposedly a foreign government owned company, so likely a Russian oil company

4569 2018-12-26 15:34:16 Comprehension must not be your strong suit. Easy to parrot the left, isn't it? Are you aware of what goes into building those? Shipping them? Assembling them? Probably not, you seem like a "Duh, no, wind good, oil bad!!" Alt left dem.

4571 2018-12-26 15:34:14 "Boiling her rabbit?" 
Low bar, dude.
What's your take on the refugee kids locked up in your refrigerated child concentration camps? The ones who die? "It's not like we boiled them in oil" ?
4572 2018-12-26 15:34:13 Get it in oil form
4573 2018-12-26 15:34:13 How many houses have burned down from: heating oil, coal, wood burning heaters/ cookers?
4574 2018-12-26 15:34:09 So is Beto taking oil money.  It was from individuals in the oil & gas industry.
4575 2018-12-26 15:33:58 All politicians have been capitulating to big oil and the banks.  
Let's ask BS for the tax returns he refuses to show us
4576 2018-12-26 15:33:57 Examining key votes is a better than a backlash that small donor oil workers contributed to his campaign.  Guilt by association via small d is not reputable.  Dig up the key votes.  Onus is on the complainers.

G-d Bless America
4585 2018-12-26 15:33:20 Nothing like having the oil light come on while on the motorway to add a certain je ne sais quoi to the journey.
4586 2018-12-26 15:33:15 I had my CAT exam. I burned oil for entire year. Now i need to party hard. I have earned it #KyuNahiBarbeque #ContestAlert #NewYearCelebrations #NewYearParty #TheLastBlast #YearEnd #PartyTime #PartyHard
4587 2018-12-26 15:33:15 At most 12 yrs to irreversible runaway warming—a climate apocalypse spelling the breakdown of society & our food supply—NO 2nd CHANCE

In 2020, it's all about TRUST.

As a corporate centrist from Texas, Beto can't be trusted to take on big oil, how's that not obvious to you Josh?
4588 2018-12-26 15:33:12 Which frustrates the favor of God. Cancels it out . Oil and Water.
4589 2018-12-26 15:33:10 Except"taking oil money" in this context just means excepting donations from people employed in the oil industry.
4590 2018-12-26 15:33:03 kanada, emptied of its minerals and dirty oil. emptied of its trees and water. a crippled thing, drowning in a puddle, covered in ants. the ocean doesn’t give a shit because it knows it’s dying too.
4591 2018-12-26 15:33:01 Nah too oily. It’ll give you spots. Find a beard balm with Argan oil or jojoba oil it’s really healthy for your beard

4595 2018-12-26 15:32:44 if Bayelsa with 3million in population is getting 12Billion yet the Oil producing communities are in ruins
what will Kano with over 16 million in population do with 6Billion ?

Poverty at the peak
4596 2018-12-26 15:32:39 also oil can rally and oils tocks can just sit around and do nothing, seen it happen quite a bit
4597 2018-12-26 15:32:36 I know all about drowning in red! My family is like a little blue dot in a sea of red, in a rural town in Ohio! I'm ashamed of my fellow Ohioands for falling for a snake oil salesman! I came to twitter to find like minds!
4598 2018-12-26 15:32:30 My grandma got me an oil diffuser for Christmas and I’m going to start using it when I shower for optimal winding down time
4599 2018-12-26 15:32:27 agree... there is always a natural buyer of Oil futures which will end up taking that other end of the position... not banks!
4600 2018-12-26 15:32:25 on to the second healthy course of the day folks. oven cooked salmon (covered in cooking oil and mixed herbs, 20-30 minutes, setting 1.7xboiling - for the benefit of both Celsius AND Fahrenheit peoples lol)

4605 2018-12-26 15:31:20 Turkey meat is v dry.. so to help meat stay tender and succulent, inject it with fat/oil.
4606 2018-12-26 15:31:19 US gains market share in energy, Trump messes things up... “Now that China has slapped U.S. LNG with a 10 percent retaliatory tariff and suspended purchases of U.S. crude oil, our increasing energy exports are at risk – to the benefit of our competitors”
@realDonaldTrump
4607 2018-12-26 15:31:17 Me too! Nanti nak Google cleansing oil/balm mana yg boleh guna ni 
4608 2018-12-26 15:31:11 sana oil
4609 2018-12-26 15:31:11 We need an investigation into treason charges and corruption in our Electoral process! Who contributed to Trudeau’s foundation! Who paid to kill Canadian oil and who profited from that act! We are in an economic war with who American Billionaires and other international criminals
4610 2018-12-26 15:31:07 Pro tip: don’t tell your boss to reach into your pocket with your oil pen in it.
4611 2018-12-26 15:30:58  your head lack oil
4612 2018-12-26 15:30:48 Maybe it's somehjng to do with renewables ,? That's the new energy taking off , oil is outdated ,
4613 2018-12-26 15:30:44 Possibly the greatest driver of population growth over the last 130 yrs has been oil. Oil made human existence remarkably easier. Instead of working just to survive man got his collective giggity on. Imagine how great things will be when energy is even cheaper and more plentiful.
4614 2018-12-26 15:30:41 He has to actually have a ‘troublesome’ record on substantive things to do that. I don’t see him taking handouts from the oil and gas industry to sell out climate change legislation or refusing to cosponsor M4A. So...
4615 2018-12-26 15:30:34 Maybe you should talk to your family and friends about it because mine already know.  Your PEEPS are the ones who want to shut down oil and gas and pipeline.  HYPOCRITE.
4616 2018-12-26 15:30:30 betul la orang kata, kalau kita rajin pakai clay mask muka kita jadi less oil. sumpah betul tak tipu!

BJP govt under PM Modi has inaugurated the Paradip Oil Refinery
4624 2018-12-26 15:29:54 Who’s about to pay $60 to get their oil changed?

Me. The fool is me...
4625 2018-12-26 15:29:50 I’m telling it’s something different when you put that oil on a dark skin girl cheeks and then when you start hitting from the back and them cheeks get to moving .... GOOD LORD 
4626 2018-12-26 15:29:46 Year 2029 is when the JFK tapes should be released. Trump while in office has signed a document to prolong this date! I want the tapes released. The world, America needs to know the truth! War creates money and easy access to oil.  Watch this movie! FBI come and get me
4627 2018-12-26 15:29:39 Erik, maybe at this time in global history we don't need to elect a President from an oil/fossil fuel state who is naturally going to be more sympathetic to those industries? Maybe we should try to avoid that if possible? #SunriseMovement
4628 2018-12-26 15:29:39 Revenue sharing formula. 
Oil producing states get higher than others. 
States owing FG Debts is another criteria in order to deduct at source.
States owed compensation for rehabilitation of FG infrastructure in their respective states.
Add your own!
4629 2018-12-26 15:29:39 Formula for success: Rise early; work hard nd strike Oil

4631 2018-12-26 15:29:23 I think oil has been using equities as a selling excuse for a while...
4632 2018-12-26 15:29:10 BS -- that money was Iran's --- due to sanctions on their country -- when they sold oil the money went into a bank account, sanctions lifted they get their money.... STOP lying to people
4633 2018-12-26 15:29:06 The column clearly says she wasn’t really getting any before this proclamation....so more bumper sticker policy....and in order to reduce emissions you’re going to need the electric utilities at the table, they’ve apparently been thrown under the bus with the oil companies lol
4634 2018-12-26 15:28:44 He told that mane he was gonna rip his balls off and boil them in motor oil 
4635 2018-12-26 15:28:41 In the last 24 hrs there were a total of 7 oil product tankers in the ports of Quebec City and Montreal. Yet according to Quebec Premier François Legault, there is no social acceptability for oil in Quebec.

4637 2018-12-26 15:28:17 Oil prices in 2019 — but there's plenty of risk to that forecast Oil analysts forecast a moderate recovery for crude prices after as sharp pullback in the third quarter.Brent crude is seen averaging about $68-$73 a barrel, up from prices below $55 today.
4638 2018-12-26 15:28:03 I got one of those essential oil burners and it's def on my list of great decisions.
4639 2018-12-26 15:28:02 Went to @thebodyshopusa to get some #Satsuma home fragrance oil and they were on sale for $1.... I grabbed’em all!!
4640 2018-12-26 15:27:59 Hope oil te
4641 2018-12-26 15:27:25 Birol seems like a smart, good guy but his total lack of experience in the oil business is painful.
4642 2018-12-26 15:26:42 Lard is the new extra virgin olive oil: on the fashionable side of West Jesmond anyway.

4648 2018-12-26 15:26:01 His very first tweet was basically saying “Beto is the recipient of lots of oil/gas $. Hmmmm, I didn’t know that. We should look into that.”

That’s what launched a tidal wave of defensiveness, as if asking questions is somehow a “luxury” that’s divisive. 

It’s not.
4649 2018-12-26 15:25:57 I know car dealerships try to upsell you during a basic oil change but I wasn’t expecting to hear that there was a mouse nest in my cabin filter pls keep the whole car I’ll be fine
4650 2018-12-26 15:25:38 We should have never intervened in ME affairs. So long as they do not genocide religious minorities and pump oil we should not get involved. Because of our intervention genocide is rampant.
4651 2018-12-26 15:25:35 โคตรตลกร้ายเลยเรื่องนี้ เห็นคนอื่นเจ็บเป็นเรื่องโจ๊กเรื่องขำ แล้วหลังจากนั้นใครรับผิดชอบร่างกายและความรู้สึกเราอ่ะ…

4655 2018-12-26 15:25:05 "หาไม่ได้หรอกในชีวิตจริง" คุณไม่เคยเจอใช่ว่าจะไม่มี
4656 2018-12-26 15:25:03 Except the whole he didn’t thing. Contributions from people who *work* in oil and gas (hello, it’s TEXAS) is not the same as taking big checks from Shell. Don’t conflate the two.
4657 2018-12-26 15:24:59 I gave gifts without receiving. My Mom liked the gumbo. I went to the Lakers Warriors game last minute. I come home and Santa dropped me off some mj oil!!!!!! Bruuuuh, hell yeah!! Maybe now edibles will do something.

4660 2018-12-26 15:24:32 we have people who don’t take care of their car... not even oil changes..
4661 2018-12-26 15:24:30 Just seen an ad for Medicines San Frontiers begging for money, but all their work@is in Muslim countries or with Muslim communities. Why aren’t the oil rich Muslims states helping their own ppl? Why do they want infidel money?
4662 2018-12-26 15:24:24 #ModiAasuchanti
BJP govt under PM Modi has inaugurated the Paradip Oil Refinery & laid the foundation of Paradip- Hyderabad pipeline of Indian Oil Corp which will not only strengthen Odisha’s energy sector but will also boost employment & investment in the region
4663 2018-12-26 15:24:21 Medterra cbd oil and yoga helps with my anxiety attacks!
4664 2018-12-26 15:24:21 We should start from those governor clamouring for restructuring.
they should realise local govt funds and take the derivation oil money to the oil communities. not sit in the state capital and swallow everything and shout restructuring the following day.
4665 2018-12-26 15:24:11 Seriously, what a sad tweet. I do believe you have absolutely NO awareness, no emphathy, no ability to understand people. Couldn't you, just for one day, have wished all that celebrate a Merry Christmas - considered those serving and working..you are a Cheap snake oil salesman
4666 2018-12-26 15:24:05 Huge rally in oil this morning approaching 4%. Rumors there is an emergency OPEC meeting.

4670 2018-12-26 15:23:30 And that's no fault of Bayelsans. We need restructuring for reasons like this. The oil communities are in ruins because greediness and indiscipline. I do understand your drift tho.

4674 2018-12-26 15:22:53 Still think GOR will go to 50+.  My point on arb opportunity was always that once CNY oil & gold were both up & running, then China would have more control over oil price; arb is "US can then have cheap gold & no shale sector, or a profitable shale sector & much higher gold px."
4675 2018-12-26 15:22:49 Wait. Apply castor oil to my beard everyday ?

4679 2018-12-26 15:22:29 The Rothschild were behind the colonization and occupations  of India and the Rothschild owned British Petroleum was  granted unlimited rights to all offshore Indian oil, which  is still valid till this day.
4680 2018-12-26 15:22:28 Use any hair oil like olive oil or coconut oil on damp hair. Applying oil or product on damp hair absorbs better.

4686 2018-12-26 15:22:04 I don't recall anyone putting a gun to Beto's head and forcing him to pledge he wouldn't take donations over $200 from executives in the oil and gas industry.
4687 2018-12-26 15:21:58 If only Beto can take MORE money from oil and gas lobbyists. Boy, he'll sure have my vote then.
4688 2018-12-26 15:21:54 Even if Oil stabilizes here in the low $40’s it won’t be enough to stop this selloff. It helped lead it down but a turn won’t matter at this point

4699 2018-12-26 15:21:01 Find an oil supply business. They usually sell puregas. I ran it in my yard equipment. Got tired of buying new weed eaters every other year.

4702 2018-12-26 15:20:30 Cleansing oil hadalabo & fw hadalaboo. Aku cocok karna dia gaada pewanginyaa & mineral oil, plus gaada sls yang bikin kulit tambah kering hehe
4703 2018-12-26 15:20:20 How does that affect the price of oil in Nigeria 
4704 2018-12-26 15:20:16 We've got to be reasonable though.
Maybe with all that whale oil they must have by now, 
the old lamps will do fine in emergencies, 
So mucking around with the gas valves looks like an option.
4705 2018-12-26 15:20:05 Life without oil & petroleum products......not so simple.
4706 2018-12-26 15:19:58 The charitable explanation is that they don't care. The real explanation is likely much worse, involving bootstraps and one of those propserity gospel religious snake oil salesmen. It is the South here.

A lot of oil production and engineering systems would be impacted for one.
4710 2018-12-26 15:19:26 if I go one more day without an oil change I'm gonna spray my load all over the fucking parking lot
4711 2018-12-26 15:19:20 Is snake  oil also part of that philosophy? #lavendaroil
4712 2018-12-26 15:19:07 Some of it becomes plastics & other products.
How do I know this? I'm from Kentucky. Sitting on some of the richest & purest Cambrian & PA Crude in the world. Ever hear of Ashland Oil, Valvoline,  Marathon?

4719 2018-12-26 15:18:12 " I don't want to be a great leader; I want to be a man who goes around with a little oil can and when he sees a breakdown, offers his help. To me, the man who does that is greater than any holy man in saffron-colored robes. The mechanic with the oilcan: that is my ideal in life.

Why is this still happening???
Do we still need lamp oil in 2019???!!!
4727 2018-12-26 15:17:33 we have over 774 local govt.
less than 15% of them have oil will. 
but they do not get the anything. 
because of the govt in the center and the state Hijack all the revenue.
Asaba do not have single oil well but all funds going to state end up there,Oil communities get nothing
4728 2018-12-26 15:17:30 According to science, we don’t have any choice but to act immediately on #ClimateChange. That’s the point u centrists keep missing. (Pelosi just killed the #GreenNewDeal.) Dems have spent so much time capitulating to banks & big oil that we’re literally out of time.
4729 2018-12-26 15:17:20 Sure they will scheme - ways to TAX EVERY THING AIR/WATER/OIL and anything else like COW GAS / etc... thats what they do, you know for the children bla bla bla
4730 2018-12-26 15:17:07 Actually, I only posted a meme.. not sure how that makes me the biggest threat to Canadians.  Take your frustrations out on someone else.. e.g.. @irvingoil  and do your research, they have stated they will still import Saudi oil with a pipeline.
4731 2018-12-26 15:16:54 Came back to the instrumentation wires I had taken off for me laying in pools of hydraulic oil. It’s a good thing this is a short week.

4738 2018-12-26 15:16:19 I hate it so much that I almost wonder if there is a cilantro-like effect for some people (me), possibly something in the oil that the processing into paprika removes?

Because it’s such an oil based flavour, peppers will effect a whole dish for me.

4742 2018-12-26 15:16:02 You would think the military would revolt at some point. I guess there is still enough oil money to buy off the soldiers.

4748 2018-12-26 15:15:29 People who dont want pipelines do not want to facilitate the expansion of the oil industry.
4749 2018-12-26 15:15:25 He is doing great. He demanded our ally Saudi Arabia not to slow the oil flow, to keep gas prices low. Not like the European socialist countries where the masses are protesting the green taxes on fossil fuels. $7 in France people get a low standard/living.
4750 2018-12-26 15:15:08 Need to get my oil changed and my dad isn’t answering the phone 
4751 2018-12-26 15:14:58 Why do my car burn oil so fast 
4752 2018-12-26 15:14:57 I think that’s fair. So let’s find out. Let’s hear a vision and analyze his record *honestly* then have an election.

The rush to paint him as a tool of fossil fuel industry (bc 0.5% of his money came from oil workers) does not seem to be in this spirit.
4753 2018-12-26 15:14:39 Looking to give away 10 of our Natural Strength Oil  Cleanser. All we ask is for an honest review of the product. DM for more info.

4770 2018-12-26 15:12:53 is so easy for a man in Asaba to claim our oil and the man from Lokoja ...No oil.
that is the hypocrisy am talking about.
it blind people like your self.
Oil Communities end up getting nothing like those in Anambra and Kano.
4771 2018-12-26 15:12:44 Inside Energy is "Shell's award winning digital channel" (their words).

Meanwhile, the cost of decommissioning North Sea oil fields has doubled from initial estimates.
4772 2018-12-26 15:12:26 RT DiMartinoBooth: RT chigrl: Here is a real problem few are discussing about US oil: When oil companies hedge (short), banks take the long side of that bet. Same banks also issue loans to keep these companies afloat, meaning they are highly overleveraged in oil debt. 1/3
4773 2018-12-26 15:12:23 Oil was just over $42/barrel when I looked yesterday. Ours is discounted off that because it's costly to refine. Canada needs to tell the world we are not only about natural resources, and start "selling" our brilliant minds, innovation and technology.
4774 2018-12-26 15:12:18 Grateful for oil of oregano 
4775 2018-12-26 15:12:17 you see, my hand holding is a vial of rose oil spilled on cement
4776 2018-12-26 15:12:11 Is that weird? I do that with my Google Home...
4777 2018-12-26 15:12:08 Clearly there has always been fake news. That's the main reason slavery went on for so long.. why lead was in water/paint for decades even though the government knew it was bad, and why we use oil instead of solar.
Because of historical fake news/propaganda for the masses.
4778 2018-12-26 15:12:02 Lmao. At all. Moisturizers like Aveeno, Vaseline (lotion), Nivea Men,blue container(this is good for boys cos the lotion is sorta 'oily' and you people don't have strength to use oil after managing to use a moisturizer.
4779 2018-12-26 15:12:00 Tangentially, do you know where I can get CBD oil capsules in the city? I don't have time for shipping.
4780 2018-12-26 15:11:40 The central and state tax, refining, supply and distribution cost which make up more than 50% of the petrol price, are fixed and do not change with crude oil price. Therefore Petrol price doesn't rise and fall at the same rate as crude.

How can you not know this. Shame.

4819 2018-12-26 15:04:55 Really? You seem to have no issues sending our brave men and women into battle for oil and power, creating enemies where none exists and declaring that there is a “War on Christmas” and Sharia law is being brought to a community near you!?

4827 2018-12-26 15:03:16 Brent oil dipped below $50 a barrel for the 1st time since July 2017 before recovering as the market turmoil & worries over U.S. supply countered signs the OPEC & coalition may extend or deepen output cuts.

4838 2018-12-26 15:02:02 Not laying blame, as Middle East very complex, just highlighting fact there are millions starving to death. But Trumps support of MbS in the Khashoggi murder is clear, and a pathetic response to murder.  Maybe put the price of a child life = barrel oil and things would change.
4839 2018-12-26 15:01:54 Well that would be something? Got any mates in the other oil and gas companies?
4840 2018-12-26 15:01:45 Dont wait for tech companies to save the thin life envelope being ripped, twisted and poisoned by oil and carbon fuel companies.

4842 2018-12-26 15:01:41 I don't think so. Putin doesn't want a war between Turkey and Syria. He wants unmolested oil/gaspipeline and shipping access to the Mediterranean Sea. Both Assaud and Erdogan are currupt leaders he can deal with.

4848 2018-12-26 15:01:10 One of my funniest moments in the year 2018 is.. A "supposed" nigga of mine beefs me coz of COOKING OIL... What a life of PETTINESS. 
4849 2018-12-26 15:01:04 Washed my hair since morning without applying oil or conditioner now it's dried up and turned to koko.
4850 2018-12-26 15:01:02 Is she tired as a result of non commitment or just tired from the drilling of oil?
4851 2018-12-26 15:00:48 Great, my issue with Beto is that he took money from oil execs and voted for legislation that expanding oil production. That, to me, is not the person who will boldly combat climate change. Is this issue a purity test for you?

I posted to Sirota’s tweet on oil donors that those weren’t corporate donations. I can’t argue with him about Beto’s votes though. Those are in the official congressional  record.

4901 2018-12-26 14:54:10 Let me see if I get this right: an oil company CEO that makes 141mil a year might have his annual salary reduced to 1.5 mil if we take steps to save the planet and all its people. And we’re supposed to feel so sorry for him that we continue to trash the planet and kill humanity?

That's tribalism not ideological disagreement.

4991 2018-12-26 14:42:11 I use straight tea tree oil and it’s amazing!  Dab it on the spot all day for a day or two and you’ll see dramatic reduction.  I get cystic acne due to pcos and it’s a game changer.
4992 2018-12-26 14:42:09 Amazing picture. It looks like an oil painting
4993 2018-12-26 14:42:06 it Is public but that’s for show. The Dem party of today is the Republican Party of the 90’s. There is nothing they will fight for unlike the Bernie, Ellison, AOC side of the party. 

The Dem party now is the party of war; tax cuts for th rich; oil; border wall; killer cops; etc

5000 2018-12-26 14:41:11 Worries about rising interest rates, trade tensions with China and slumping oil prices have spooked investors for much of the 4th qtr, putting all 3 indexes on track for annual declines for the first time since 2008.

5020 2018-12-26 14:39:05 A THOUGHT FOR TODAY:

I don't want to be a great leader; I want to be
a man who goes around with a little oil can and when he sees a breakdown,
offers his help. To me, the man who does that is greater than any holy man in
saffron-colored robes.
5021 2018-12-26 14:38:59 Multifaceted indeed. First you manipulate your currency to enrich  a few. Then you seize private property , then implement price controls and trade restrictions to actually make your economy worse , wait for oil prices to fall. Cue hyperinflation.Blame US imperialism.Multifaceted

5037 2018-12-26 14:37:11 @USRepKCastor The problem was not that your answer on environmental committee members taking oil money was not "artful", it's that you are taking a position where you need to make an artful (clever or skillful, typically in a crafty or cunning way), rather than an honest, answer.

5047 2018-12-26 14:36:20 The meltup in production of this year is in good part banks trying to get their money faster. Under any scenario of financial stress, banks will end up owning higher participation in oil rigs. The only risk of them not getting paid is the risk of field exhaustion... 8/n

5068 2018-12-26 14:34:08 Sir, if I am correct, there are fixed costs and there are variable costs.
Like for e.g refinement is a fixed cost. Electricity, salary, depreciation are all fixed costs.
Crude oil price is a variable cost.
It would be unfair to calculate on the basis of %.

5137 2018-12-26 14:25:17 @realDonaldTrump Mr President, why are you allowing the Russians to gain a foothold in your backyard (The Caribbean). Now they have sent troops and jets to Venezuela, endangering my fellow Caribbean country of Guyana, which now has a large oil reserve.

5264 2018-12-26 14:09:20 Government bond prices ended higher today as sharp fall in crude oil prices on Monday strengthened hopes of a softer monetary policy. Some market players booked profits to boost their books before the quarter end Dec. thereby, capping further gains.

5271 2018-12-26 14:08:12 That 44% of landmass has oil, gold, copper and iron and all the minerals you could ask for. You could make balochistan into a goddamn industrial powerhouse even with its small population

5276 2018-12-26 14:07:54 This is definitely one of the best news articles on the African continent, when actually realizing the many attributes of this crop which go in tandem with SDGs. Healthy seed oil, cooking oil, ethanol, feedstock, rubber, plastic, fabric, wood, decarbonization. Mass job creation!

5280 2018-12-26 14:07:29 We had to find a jet wash, it absolutely stunk, it was old oil from an Indian restaurant above, thankfully we got it cleaned and our parking zeroed, but not what I wanted first thing Boxing Day!

5287 2018-12-26 14:07:06 I know your point. Oil, Uranium, rare earth metals. Actually pressuring some of the places to act as nations may be impossible. War Lords are semi autonomous nations themselves. China is already dug in in Paki, Afghanistan,  I feel they are on a bad path financially
5288 2018-12-26 14:06:59 you young men have to sit firm and straight and contemplate until your
breathing is like the continuous, smooth flow of a stream of oil, with no
break in its current and no external thought to disturb your concentration

5297 2018-12-26 14:06:11 3 different cheese: white cheddar, smoked Gouda and cream cheese. 3 different triscuits: roasted red pepper, tomato basil and olive oil with cracked pepper. Obviously pepperoni and prosciutto. 

My fav was prosciutto with cream cheese 

Also pickles and mild cauliflower
5298 2018-12-26 14:05:58 It also tells us, under persistently falling prices, and/or as rates increase, banks might end up owning higher share of total production. So essentially, both producers and the banks are naturally long oil price. It's not just a debtor/creditor relation 4/n

5302 2018-12-26 14:05:32 there is a great book by Sari Solden on this. Also on a side note: my ADHD son who bipolar meds havent ever helped, vapes CBD oil now and says it is the most effective thing ever
5303 2018-12-26 14:05:27 This need to be clarified by govt. The oil companies gives best salaries and perks to its employees but always cries on margins. If govt using this differential for other good purposes say it exclusively in yr annual budget with absolute numbers of differential. @PMOIndia
5304 2018-12-26 14:05:23 It's not really, That's just the zeitgeist of our time, I'm sure a lot of people thought putting lantern oil in a big metal box to fly thought that was stupid too.  Imagine the first idiot that tried to ride a horse into battle given their skittish nature and bucking reflex
5305 2018-12-26 14:05:21 It was a dark mood that hung like a shadowy vapor over the wildlife refuge, as if the animals who lived there could already hear the drilling, could already taste the slick oil in their streams.

5309 2018-12-26 14:04:32 That CBD oil is not the wave... its THC or nothing for me
5310 2018-12-26 14:04:08 Sometimes the meat is eaten but more often they’re hunted for their blubber and natural oil, which is unique to whales. The blubber and oil has some industrial uses such as fuel, animal feed, soap, and margarine. Bones are also taken for decorations and trinkets
5311 2018-12-26 14:04:04 Oil is trying to rise and Trump is encouraging people to buy stocks. A lot of his followers will do that. Past Presidents who said to buy the market were right. I saw a chart yesterday.

5327 2018-12-26 14:02:27 Long term, does anyone believe the Chinese are going to let an American company take a lot of the profits in BEV's? Their strategy is to wean themselves off of oil dependence AND leapfrog RoW in car manufacturing next technology. 2 birds 1 stone, and Tesla is not winning there.
5328 2018-12-26 14:02:04 I’m thinking of trying CBD oil as well. Would you recommend it? I was reading that the more you use it the better your results will be.

5340 2018-12-26 14:00:26 Putin's a middling leader. Plays a bad hand well but hampered by not bothering to have a strategy, he just takes tactical wins where he can. 

And of course. Ex: People seem to forget Russia voted for the UN intervention in Libya to take an oil producing rival out of the game.
5341 2018-12-26 14:00:24 The myth that oil companies make less when oil prices are low is ridiculous. When prices are 50% less twice as much oil is used - maybe more.

The current unfounded downturn in oil prices will force leveraged American shale companies to shrink or go out of business. Setting up the stage for higher prices in 2 years. Just in time for the #Aramco IPO.

5373 2018-12-26 13:54:46 grab your peppermint essential oils and head to the bath tub! Drop in about 6 drops of the oil in steamy water and soak. The peppermint extracts fevers and should speed up recovery and break the fever you have. After that you'll be ready for a nap for sure

2nd - These are personal donations
3rd - Texas oil industry is huge, local interests are politics

5389 2018-12-26 13:53:37 We are looking for money to fund our Federal budget, have we considered imposing Taxes on our religious institutions. They can fund our budget without oil. Anyway, this is my personal opinion.

5398 2018-12-26 13:51:58 What crude oil price are you giving kudos to? Not rocket science in reality, it’s called will and right governance. Crude oil price was once double the amount it is now. #Think
5399 2018-12-26 13:51:55  So many options to treat yo'self! They have great skincare lines. Drunk Elephant, Tatcha and Dr. Dennis Gross are what I'd splurge on. Also Josie Moran argan oil body butter. I recommend Bite Beauty agave lip balm to anyone with a mouth. That stuff is amazing on dry lips!

5435 2018-12-26 13:46:28 The handful of hi-rollers who control the stock market are cashing in - at the expense of the “little people’s” 401k plans. There aren’t reasons for the massive drop. They’re excuses. When oil dropped in the past, the mkt. went wild !! Low unemployment.... same thing. Go figure.

5439 2018-12-26 13:46:12 Yeah, no. Basically you have a single tweet about oil donors, a commentary on his issues page, and an analysis of his voting record. All fair game.The same person who spread the “chairs thrown in NV” myth calls it a war, Neera Tanden links it to Bernie, and we’re off and running.

5457 2018-12-26 13:42:16 Airports are by federal government.  Tech gets subsidies through special tax credits. Farmers are subsidized so maybe we shouldn't have to,pay for our food? Oil companies have been subsidized for years through depletion allowances so maybe they should pay for roads.

5467 2018-12-26 13:40:38 It wasnt 'oil money' in the tradional sense. it wasnt from lobbyists it wasnt from 'the industry.' thats where Sirota was disingenuous. his wording was loaded and didnt reflect that it was coming from every day workers, who might have given for to Beto for any number of reasons.

5497 2018-12-26 13:36:51 Canada still sucks. We bought an oil pipeline even the oil companies don’t want and First Nations reserves still don’t have potable drinking water.

5543 2018-12-26 13:29:58 Honey, 

I don't even think you have the answer. 

Saudi Arabia is as different (politically / economically) from India

As oil and water: they both liquids, but they ain't the same liquid. 

Ya just can't drink OIL.
5544 2018-12-26 13:29:56 I have been at the dealership for an oil change for ten seconds and I’m already ready to smack somebody.
5545 2018-12-26 13:29:33 Perhaps they would steal the yet to be "found" oil. Diamonds money is gone.
5546 2018-12-26 13:29:33 Sure. People have tanks of oil for heating here, in remote places, and septic tanks, but I've never heard of drinking water provided that way. But I'm a townie :)

5549 2018-12-26 13:29:07 Oh yeah like the yearly cosmetic revision the US manufacturers did to the junk they served up in the 1960's. Real change only comes from external pressures, as it did with the oil crisis & now over polution

5568 2018-12-26 13:25:44 That’s been my thesis for about 10 dollars on oil. It’s been hard to trade from the long side. PNL has been disasterous. Now everyone I think is trading on their heels which won’t get us any incremental positive momentum. Until that changes I’m almost flat.

5670 2018-12-26 13:10:55 It has a very unbalanced economy, predominantly reliant on one commodity-oil. It pegs its currency to the USD and majority of its debt is denominated in USD. It does not create USD, it must earn them via oil export. The price of oil collapsed creating conditions for implosion.
5671 2018-12-26 13:10:55 I re-roasted some potatoes to eat for lunch and they released quite a bit of oil despite having been sat on kitchen roll. Maybe if yours have another 7 minutes of cooking in them (without burning) it might be worth a go? Also, *hot* double carbs ftw

5699 2018-12-26 13:06:09 What kind of oil does a Bible produce?

SNAKE OIL.


5700 2018-12-26 13:05:47 Venezuela  like Nigeria doesn't make, grow nor sell anything but oil, and oil is both globally plentiful and cheap right now.
5701 2018-12-26 13:05:46 I like your beer especially neck oil but why so expensive? I can get 4 500ml bottles of equally good beer for 6 quid!! Sort it out please.

5708 2018-12-26 13:05:16 C'mon, what's a bot gotta do to get an oil fix around here?
5709 2018-12-26 13:05:14 No, we don't want another milqetoast Centrist who will enrich oil & gas and kill us all.
5710 2018-12-26 13:05:00 The change we have witnessed is that the is no longer cooking oil and soft drinks in shops.
5711 2018-12-26 13:04:51 Don't mind them, people hate what they can't be.
5712 2018-12-26 13:04:43 Political stumbles is a mild way of putting it. Trudeau and his fellow Liberals have done everything in their power to kill the oil industry.
5713 2018-12-26 13:04:43 you know what’s super upsetting?? 

that people with college degrees work in the oil field cause that’s where the money is..like they busted their ass to get that degree just for their profession to be underpaid..it’s not fair. it makes me so mad lol.
5714 2018-12-26 13:04:37 When oil drops so far & so fast, there have to be forced liquidations in many other areas. These guys are risk takers and have leverage on top of 40% drop —hard to think there won’t be some “fast red” in other arenas.
5715 2018-12-26 13:04:14 ลองซื้อ cleansing oil ของ THREE มันก็โอเคนะ แต่เราก็ยังชอบ exfoliating power ของ Dior มากกว่าอะ ถ้าเทียบราคา dior ถูกกว่าด้วย ส่วนปริมาณเราว่าคุ้มกว่าเยอะ >.<

Huge amounts of $$$!!!  all because our corrupt last president pre-sold our oil production to China and Singapore until 2024.

5746 2018-12-26 13:00:22 Sat here watching my mum trying to get oil out the spray oil bottle thing knowing full well I dropped it all over the floor the other day 
5747 2018-12-26 13:00:07 Absolutely. US situation may be bad but it's precarious in China, EU, Japan & Middle East. India less said is better.. fortunately got a breather with low oil prices.
5748 2018-12-26 13:00:03 I learned about CBD oil!
5749 2018-12-26 12:59:44 ... We eagerly await our '2days on' and now those 2 days have been auctioned to others. When this complaint is heard and when you discover the 'leaking oil' story to be the farce that it is, I want my 2 days!!!

5762 2018-12-26 12:57:29 Capitalism did not create the social security or the NHS. Capitalism wants to sell them or put to them out to contract to the highest bidder. North Korea is a Dictatorship and Venezuela is being starved to death by the Capitalist US government because they want their oil.

5837 2018-12-26 12:46:16 Low oil prices don’t help out the oilfield if prices don’t go back to at least 70 dollars a barrel company’s will be laying off people this coming New Year dumping all that oil from OPEC and Iran  wasn’t good for us at all and when you knock down oil prices it’s trouble for all
5838 2018-12-26 12:46:09 because it's shale oil, which isn't profitable to extract until oil recovers to $60/barrel -- gas prices have to double.

5850 2018-12-26 12:44:23 The point was, he pledged to take ZERO dollars from oil industry executives, champ. Try to keep up.
5851 2018-12-26 12:44:06 We are happy to 'go back to where we come from' once our diamonds, crowns, gold, oil, agriculture and billions in casg are returned to us. Deal?
5852 2018-12-26 12:44:03 We neglect all these natural resources and focus only on crude oil
5853 2018-12-26 12:44:01 Oh no...I pulled off a  birthday card from someone very famous for someone a while back  for free. How I did it ..I never know to this day.
5854 2018-12-26 12:44:01 Look, you seem like a nice lil NPC but the facts speak for themselves, man does not cause warming, it's the sun and it ain't doing much for a while as it is taking a lil "nappy" (solarminimum).
Good luck proving that "big oil" is causing your imaginary sea level "feels"!
5855 2018-12-26 12:43:57 I’ve heard of putting some cooking oil in there. It will suffocate, die and come out. If it’s dead, use warm water in place of cooking oil

5858 2018-12-26 12:43:13 No it was Nixon who took us off the Gold standard in the early 70's. The government tried to tell us there was no oil
5859 2018-12-26 12:42:45 That was the idea but I want to first see how PLA react to mineral oil.
5860 2018-12-26 12:42:22 The fact that he took big oil money kinda disqualifies him
5861 2018-12-26 12:42:12 Myrrh sounds like an essential oil for massages bought at Molton Brown, and was probably meant to be a private gift just for Mary.
5862 2018-12-26 12:41:49 Omg would be amazing you filled that with mineral oil and added something non-conductive for snow. Boom, snow globe
5863 2018-12-26 12:41:48 ...your reply is a bit of  contradiction....

I’d need a few quid to even get a Christmas card off Elton, never mind him warming his toes in front of the fire ...
5864 2018-12-26 12:41:47 How did terrorists smuggle 000's of trucks of oil into NATO Turkey without being stopped by constant hovering NATO jets till the Russians intervened? Terrorists don't just come out of a hole in the Arab desert fully armed & financed! Much as MSM would love to portray
5865 2018-12-26 12:41:22 Most of the ME are under Israel's control.  Iraq, Iran, Lebanon and Syria have already suffered consequences so they are fully aware.  Most of the oil states are dictatorships.  All of the Arab Springs were organized by Israel so Israel have the people they want in control there.
5866 2018-12-26 12:41:20 When you think how much crude oil Venezuela exported via those huge tankers in the 60s & 70s it seems odd
5867 2018-12-26 12:41:19 Without whale oil we would have no Declaration of Independence, well the July 4th date would have been delayed at least severely.  Whaling founded most of the new settlements in South East Asia as well.

You know...your perception of wealth gives you everything is probably very wrong.
5891 2018-12-26 12:38:05 This looks great, looks like my favourite quick snack: Grate 1 small potato & 1 small onion, add a pinch of salt, one pinch of Madras Curry powder (Rajah is best), mix well. Wrap in tea-towel & squeeze to remove water, shall fry in oil & serve with sweet-chill sauce on the side.
5892 2018-12-26 12:38:02 And? These fields require a lot of investment which will never turn a profit with the current and foreseeable situation in the oil &transportation market. 
I do not know what the good solution for Wenesuela is, I do know however, that they are really f*cked in geopolitical terms.

5906 2018-12-26 12:36:06 It's tough to condone it when we helped fund both sides of it.  Where do you think the payments we made Iran went? Where did the rebels get those missiles they were firing into Saudi Arabia?  There is more to it than big oil, but oil is definitely a reason.
5907 2018-12-26 12:35:43 The special interests produce huge amounts of "fruit oils" (palm oil) along with excessively fatty beef - they feed the animal grain/grass with herbicides that cause them to eat more and have a hormonal effect to cause fat gain.

They overproduce fat, so they stuff us with fat!
5908 2018-12-26 12:35:33 partially correct.  he sold himself on his celebrity (past), his racism (née bitherism & the wall) & taking US back to an era which never existed. anti-science and intellectual.  playing on their fears and all snake oil

5916 2018-12-26 12:33:00 Thanks. Yes, the Worldbank seems optimistic, espec. in view of oil price development.
5917 2018-12-26 12:32:57 Predicting oil price has never been easy but one thing to guide against is using spot rate as Boason just did. 2018 average was more than $60. I cant speak for them but i suspect "projection" is based on historical data, agreed production cut, geopolitics.

5944 2018-12-26 12:29:02 Tune up, check up, change oil

5945 2018-12-26 12:28:42 I get what you're saying, but if we remove palm oil, the demands for other oils increase and because they are not as productive per acre, even more land is needed to meet that demand. As I say, not a simple, single issue. Sustainability is the most important factor. How to do?

5973 2018-12-26 12:24:20 No. Of course not. But IMO toppling Maduro is not the answer. The opposition's leaders are just as bad, maybe worse, than Maduro. Maduro needs to make Venezuela's debt payments. He can't, because of sanctions. If he doesn't, Russia will own Venezuela's oil fields.

5976 2018-12-26 12:23:37 It's not just about the donations. It's about Beto's votes to enable the fossil fuel industry and the fact that it's not practical to have a Democratic nominee at this late stage who's more interested in pandering to people in the oil industry than fighting climate change.
5977 2018-12-26 12:23:37 I known I spent 11 yrs working in the oil industry. But once in awhile I like to be idealistic and tweet my hope for the future. 

And in my tweet I mentioned turning established industries green. That was specific b/c I know ppl will resist change unless there are jobs.

5985 2018-12-26 12:21:27 You have to question most ingredients grown almost anywhere. There are sustainable palm oil growers out there. If we demand, that's what we'll get.

6206 2018-12-26 11:48:23 Lest we forget, the spread between Oil Production (100.9mb/d) & Demand (99.6mb/d) is 1.3m barrels. As prices fall, production will drop and prices rise again. Gone are the days when OPEC can stabilize prices. Oil is now subject to the Boom/Bust cycles of Capitalism.

Question is: how much credit risk did they keep on their books?  If I recall banks did put out exposure numbers in the 14-15 oil sell off...
6246 2018-12-26 11:38:25 i just googled and found a thing that says 3-5 drops of oil per 100ml of water so i’m assuming u mix the oil with water

6250 2018-12-26 11:37:48 Exports from #Iraq's northern Kirkuk oilfields to the #Turkish port of Ceyhan will stay at between 80-90,000 barrels per day (bpd) as most of the crude produced is being diverted to feed refineries in the north, Iraq's oil minister said on Wednesday.

6253 2018-12-26 11:37:24 12p would be a travesty.   This was far higher on anticipation alone.   Oil prices have tanked but that’s short term.    Hitting hundreds of bopd for years will see a smoother return.    Plus the divis alone could be worth the current SP if everything hits.
6254 2018-12-26 11:37:17 You did know that Barzani family produced the first female rabbi and that the first tanker of ISIS oil processed in the mom and pop refineries through Erbil ended up unloading in Isreal after it departed Turkey right ?
6255 2018-12-26 11:36:29 I was born during Nixon...but my family kept oil paintings of FDR above the fireplace!

I think Eleanor Roosevelt would’ve been a great POTUS
6256 2018-12-26 11:36:26 “Yellow Peril” - oil painting stages.
6257 2018-12-26 11:36:25 As for loose vs tight, it's a bit of a mix, steam cylinder oil is quite thick (600W or greater, to use the familiar oil ratings), so the pistons are tighter in the bore on air then on steam, whereas the motion is probably looser, as it uses a regular machine oil.
6258 2018-12-26 11:36:17 This should rattle world oil markets
6259 2018-12-26 11:36:16 Healthy fats come from things like Avocado and olive oil, not french fries and mayonnaise!

6263 2018-12-26 11:35:28 The people like you are creating disturbance and then pouring oil in troubled waters. Pakistan reaction and the replies from your friends are just in line with overall script to defame the country and nationalist forces. Keep it up, after all the masters want results.
6264 2018-12-26 11:35:17 Yes, hot pan no oil. Keep moving it , will burn your fingers. I would for about 3 minutes, but in 5 second bursts. If you leave it it goes tougher ( and grey)

6266 2018-12-26 11:35:16 My theory is Tsunami's are caused by man -they are destroying the earth crust as they are taking all the minerals, Gas and Oil and not replacing it with anything but air and water.  Those minerals are part of the earth's crust and are there for a reason not for man's greed.
6267 2018-12-26 11:35:05 When you flatt share & the other occupant repeatedly leaves the stove filthy, Burnt on grease, Not exaggerating to say the hob rings swimming in oil.  I kindly pointed out the fire risk & unkindness of repeatedly leaving  it like this. But I am the problem. I compromise a lot. 
6268 2018-12-26 11:34:31 i've been talking abt saudi arabia since day one.
from wahabism, to beheadings, to patriarchy.
i've never understood why they get away with so much. any other country would get called out, there'd be an uproar.
they're not the only country w/oil.
6269 2018-12-26 11:34:31 Yes, the refineries bad shape and the employees low-skilled. I think Maduro is trading Venezuela's natural gas for the imported gasoline. Venezuela owes Russia a lot of $, if Maduro can't pay, Russia could take over its oil reserves and refining. USA should lift sanctions...

6273 2018-12-26 11:34:23 I use coconut oil, which helps. My sac gets scrunched up in the ring, and that’s when it hurts. When the skin is flat against the ring it’s no problem at all. My balls are quite high and tight, which doesn’t help.
6274 2018-12-26 11:34:18 Takes a lot more than getting called to account. The Chinese aren't sweating international opinion much in Tibet and four nations are denying the Kurds their sovereignty at virtually no cost. Things would be very different if Israel had oil or a huge consumer base like China.

6276 2018-12-26 11:33:44 The imports from other countries come with price tags such as very poor environmental standards and human rights abuses to say the least.

6284 2018-12-26 11:32:23 Fake news. This is false. Israel attacks Syria on a regular basis and all other matters are just excuses. Israel does it due to Genie energy which is owned by various mostly Jewish (unfortunately) globalists & which drills illegally for oil in Syria. Israel's a thief & murderer.

6300 2018-12-26 11:30:02 As well. The oil you currently import in the east primarily comes from the US as shale oil, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Nigeria. Shale oil is terribly detrimental to the environment. Extraction can cause Mercury pollution etc.

6476 2018-12-26 10:56:17 And since most of the Arabian and Gulf nations generate their electricity via oil-fired power generation, their surging demand in particular is causing their own domestic oil consumption to increasingly eat into their oil export ratios

6492 2018-12-26 10:53:24 Truth is, without oil money, we would all suddenly develop common sense.

Oil didn't do anything to us, but our indigenous iniquitous political-economic structure has been THE curse to Nigeria

6547 2018-12-26 10:44:33 Based on my research most permian frackers are now profitable with oil over 40, but some have gotten their costs down to $28 a barrel. The unprofitable wells will simply get shut down if this persists. So what price should we really worry about in the US?

The previous administrators were too content and complacent on oil revenues to care about tax changes. The description fits.

6649 2018-12-26 10:20:20 And don’t forget, many Governments are forming pacts globally to eliminate coal & reduce oil & gas use by set target dates. The only  ones ignoring scientists & fighting this are “Digressive  Political Parties”, clutching onto the past. So stop voting for them.

6651 2018-12-26 10:19:25 I'm particularly impressed by the coconut oil.
6652 2018-12-26 10:19:24 I thought about this too. No option but for banks/lenders to take haircuts. Note that oil price for first 9mon of 2018 was significantly higher than 2017, so shale players did have a temporary respite.
6653 2018-12-26 10:19:22 Given that war was based on manipulation, manufactured information & a delusional expectation of becoming dominant in the Middle East (& over oil) & should have been opposed & stopped, now Turkey and Russia are using much of the same playbook should we not do the same?

6677 2018-12-26 10:16:26 That's because Open Secrets draws no distinction between PAC money and working in an industry. West Texas has a lot of oil and gas workers and while Cruz made sure to take industry PAC money, O'Rourke made a point of taking individual contributions.

6728 2018-12-26 10:08:11 As oil price goes up, EVs will be more attractive to buyers as well.  Also, as production volumes increase, cost of raw materials drops due to bulk buying.  Tesla will develop other revenue streams as well with an autonomous vehicle ridesharing app called the Tesla network.

6735 2018-12-26 10:06:11 News: China PFY prices mostly decreased today.

Given the fluctuation of crude oil and PTA futures, local PFY offers in Jiangsu and Zhejiang still dropped by 100-300 yuan/ton. Trading atmosphere was thin, as wait-and-see stance prevailed.

6736 2018-12-26 10:05:48 Culture and history do not excuse reckless and irresponsible behavior. Finite resources such as wild animals,oil and minerals require protections so that they are never abused. Whales are protected under international treaties. Treaties which Japan ignores.

6798 2018-12-26 09:55:57 The example @davidsirota used as Beto taking "oil money" was an indiv contrib running TX small biz, widower of @HRC activist, married in @UUA, long time Dem donor, now single gay dad 2 kids. Probably not buying Beto's vote for Big Oil. Do what David suggested, think for yourself.

6818 2018-12-26 09:51:50 I think this was a great and balanced piece. But I suppose your standpoint is unsurprising considering you still favour burning coal, think tar sand activity is humans ‘cleaning up the biggest oil spill in nature’ and air pollution is positive. Whatever next Mr Moore?

6829 2018-12-26 09:50:26 We should also use some of Scotland’s oil money to top up their foodbanks. Too many kids living below the breadline. That might keep the gullible lot up there quiet for a while

6830 2018-12-26 09:50:20 Maybe if Beto wasn’t 2nd in accepting cash from oil executives there wouldn’t be much to “orchestrate”.  

Stop blaming the messenger. 

I for one want a real progressive not another shill for Wall Street. Don’t know who that is but millions for big oil is not a good sign.
6831 2018-12-26 09:50:11 I agree with you about Brexit and "reconciliation" (which would work better after truth and apologies) but according to Wikipedia, Justin Welby worked for 11 years in oil and gas, so he does at least have more industrial experience than a lot of MPs.

6844 2018-12-26 09:48:25 Post Brexit India is going to be an increasingly important trading partner. If all it takes is £95m to oil the wheels of commerce then this is good value, and £95m is a lot less than our net multi billion pound contribution to the EU.

6850 2018-12-26 09:47:01 His voting record in favor of fracking and and big oil coupled with his violation of the no #FossilFuelMoney pledge he signed are problematic at best. 

The only thing you're defending is his fundraising potential which is NOT all we need to consider when weighing our support.

6852 2018-12-26 09:47:00 I really want to see the deals based on oil that were done by institutions before the rise of China as creditor of record. iirc there is not much difference

6855 2018-12-26 09:46:33 Thats not true, oil prices similarly went up 40% from $65 to $87 but the pump prices in Mumbai went up only 20% from 75 to 90. 

So the pass on has been proportionate and not linear. Check your data please.

6881 2018-12-26 09:42:21 That it’s commonplace to get big donations from oil execs is sort of the point. That’s grotesque and needs to end. Beto has some awareness of this because he made a pledge not to accept donations from oil execs - which he broke.

6884 2018-12-26 09:41:33 The reason was they wanted to get rid of the name OiLibya because of the way people perceived that it was owned by the tough Libya regime with the word Libya in it and didn't want to associate with it anymore, otherwise OLA stands for Oil LibyA Oil still.

Also to be mentioned, western whaling industry in the 19c is the main cause for whales population decline since they only obtained for the whale's oil unlike Japan using all parts.

Tell me something I didn't know. Dick Cheney is a greedy heartless scumbag.
I think what they left out is the ties between Halliburton, the Oil Company Cheney was CEO of, and Iraq War. 1/

7082 2018-12-26 09:05:42 Oil is not a negative thing.
7083 2018-12-26 09:05:22 RT winknews:

The holidays are here, which means many of us will do some cooking and baking. But when it comes to choosing the right cooking oil, the choices can be overwhelming. From canola to coconut, Consumer Reports separates fat facts from fiction.

7089 2018-12-26 09:03:49 The most important part of the recipe is to have the oven hot, the oil hot before pouring the batter in, and don't open the oven door to have a peek.
7090 2018-12-26 09:03:46 Oh look, the site he links to is shilling HealthDanger snake oil products. What a funny coincidence.
7091 2018-12-26 09:03:32 So wonderfully considerate of you to show Big Oil & Gas the true path, I'll just bet they can't wait to hear the divine word of the one true prophet
7092 2018-12-26 09:03:07 Would have had to be in oil paintings quite frankly
7093 2018-12-26 09:03:03 The problem with your rustic brain is that it has never been used. Who is he going to sell crude oil to in Kwara? Alatenuje Eru Saraki
7094 2018-12-26 09:02:56 The 12th Finance Commission has recommended that the State of AP should get it's royalty for the oil refinery in KG basin.The BJP govt is not implementing this recommendation. #APDharmaporatam #ChennaiTdpForum #CbnArmyGuntur #CBNDharmaporatam
7095 2018-12-26 09:02:52 He was #1 or #2 for every single industry, because he raised a ton of money. The amount from oil & gas employees was 0.5% of his funds.

7106 2018-12-26 09:01:12 One positive from dropping oil price is that FX for subsidy will reduce

7119 2018-12-26 08:59:19 Great advice coming from a Millennial.
Take alook around you and write down everything in your house that is a byproduct of oil/gas. 
Now throw that all away and what do you have? 
Nothing is what u have.
What’s your alternative to having nothing?
Get real!
7120 2018-12-26 08:59:15 Using the oil used to fry chicken to fry plantain is the best. Makes it almost taste like chicken flavored plantain
7121 2018-12-26 08:59:13 Please where is the anointing oil, let's ordain @2hypegang as the new showbiz prophet. His #FLOPPALHOLIC indeed came to pass.

7129 2018-12-26 08:58:13 He showed that 30 CEO's contributed top donations, certainly a reason for concern. Pushing oil/gas, including off-shore fracking in the name of energy independence should be of great concern to us all when scientists give us only 12 years to avert the worst of Climate Change!
7130 2018-12-26 08:57:54 A country so poor, you literally had to enslave an army of herring to power your lutefisk mines. It's like Mad Max III up there, but Tina Turner's chacter is replaced by a man in shorts playing an accordion. Badly. Also, definitely no oil.
7131 2018-12-26 08:57:40 thanks caelum!!
7132 2018-12-26 08:57:37 Iran would still need a regime change, but they used to be a liberated people. I'm not sure what we could salvage from Arabia. The two biggest exports seem to be oil and evil.

7141 2018-12-26 08:56:07 UPDATE ON OIL PRICES:
Crude futures plunged to fresh 17-month lows Monday, due to:
-  a sell-off  in equity markets
- possible prolonged partial US government shutdown
- despite OPEC and Russia ministers reiterating commitment to production cuts in  January #energy #oilprices

7145 2018-12-26 08:55:46 Either way, battery tech is on average more environmentally friendly than the equivalent oil based alternative, if the electricity you use to charge your vehicle is produced in a renewable way, massively more so.

7159 2018-12-26 08:51:22 Sad point of view IMHO.

Seems to me more education is required on the positive impacts of Alberta oil being shipped out of country.

JOBS
TAXES
STANDARD OF LIVING ,ETC.

Explain how does it make sense that we import even a litre of foreign oil at all? MOST OF IT IS BLOODY OIL!!

7166 2018-12-26 08:49:09 Mo baked it. I think it's basically just flour, oil & sugar - maybe a little vanilla essence

7174 2018-12-26 08:47:59 None of this has anything to do w/ David's tweet. You just keep bringing up unrelated nonsense. And you're still getting your facts wrong. 37 donors *didn't* give "such an outsized contribution." They gave ~0.05% of O'Rourke total. It's only ~10% of money from from oil employees.
7175 2018-12-26 08:47:49 rap talaga ng chicken oil
7176 2018-12-26 08:47:48 The previous government of PDP lead federal government, and the whole country get 30 trillion in 16yrs according to "Prof Charles Soludo"when they is surplus in oil crude. They built a lot of road, revamp our local  airport, built more international equipped airport.

7188 2018-12-26 08:45:00 a bad cake recipe is a mystery. do you add a 1/2 less of sugar. do you use margarine instead of a butter, or less oil in general? do you put it in the fridge for an hour before cooking? how long do you cook it? is it dangerous if you whip too long?
7189 2018-12-26 08:44:38 Sure
7190 2018-12-26 08:44:36 The boy is foolish, is that how to treat a human? Simply go private n tell her what u said, public ridicule ain't cool
7191 2018-12-26 08:44:35 Crude oil again under 50$ per barrel, so govt should have to reduce the prices,
7192 2018-12-26 08:44:34 We need social and political innovation at the highest levels. Lobbyists for Renewable Energy need to have a louder voice than the oil and coal lobbyists. We need a better system for humanity before we settle onto another planet. Remember the aliens from "Independence Day"?
7193 2018-12-26 08:44:19 The 12th Finance Commission has recommended that the State of AP should get it's royalty for the oil refinery in KG basin.The BJP govt is not implementing this recommendation. #BangaloreTDP #CBNArmy #APDharmaporatam #CBNDharmaporatam

7195 2018-12-26 08:43:23 From oil & gas to organic farming, the transition is welcome but the motive is suspect. Pay & perks must be related to the work.

7200 2018-12-26 08:42:33 Taking anyone serious who uses fossil fuels, or any day to day household product derived from oil who says no to pipelines/says we must use alternate energy sources is a hypocrite. When you soley use alternatives, then your opinion and walk the talk status is worthy of a listen.

7207 2018-12-26 08:41:13 None of those things has anything to do with the oil prices falling. What an idiot he is.

7225 2018-12-26 08:37:36 $8 billion in cash, countless amounts of oil & whatever else looted within Iraq, from '03-'05. Then all the US 'contracts' subsidised by US taxpayers.

7287 2018-12-26 08:26:44 Heartbreaking and cleverly done. I decided to stop using Palm Oil last year and always check the label for it. You would be amazed at the amount of products which use it once you start looking. Hope these companies start using kinder alternatives.

7490 2018-12-26 07:48:32 Secondly, Your inability to recognize a grievance is appalling to say the least. Grievance however misplaced will lead to a reckoning. In the case of Alberta, the economy stayed off the brink yet again, because politicians worked together to cut the supply of oil.

7502 2018-12-26 07:45:52 So all other countries who have always done this. Now all a sudden those who hate everything about where they lived and left. Want to take religion?culture etc from everyone else? Again! Oil and water don’t mix.
7503 2018-12-26 07:45:47 I wouldn’t recommend trying to fry using an electric cooktop. Gas is best for anything that requires quick delivery and adjustment of heat, like frying does.

If you have to go electric, buy an electric deep fryer. You’ll have better control of the oil temp than with a hot plate.
7504 2018-12-26 07:45:40 I love you, but I've chosen coconut oil.

7758 2018-12-26 06:50:27 Yes,  like any other product, oil has to compete.  Earlier there was no alternate available so it has monopoly in market, but today it has to compete with other sources of energy and to keep it in demand the producers are losing grip Earth is no more a #fossilfuel planet

7765 2018-12-26 06:48:57 lol I’m not from Texas and I don’t work for the oil industry, I’m just not interested in wasting time banning plastic straws when the pollution killing us is all industrial and for the most part international.

7771 2018-12-26 06:47:24 oil near the local bottom. Brent can fly up to 55-58-60 dollars per barrel. This is usually from 10% to 20%. When you make a lot of money, do not forget me. From the millions  of dollars I will not give up.

7788 2018-12-26 06:43:52 The healthier version has a very short shelf life due to the oil from the maize germ. On the contrary, manufacturers fetch additional revenues by adding value to the germ and bran and selling it as animal feeds.
7789 2018-12-26 06:43:52 It's British heritage symbolising how great this country is and has been in the past .... if you want Communism,  study Stalin, Mao, Polpot or more recently oil rich Venezuelan PM Maduro supported by Corbyn, whose people are starving!
7790 2018-12-26 06:43:41 Oh no! Texas Oil speaks! 
We can not only stop it, we can reverse it. Listen to your mate Beto, HE is talking the talk, at least; whether he'll walk the walk ... 
You made me pour another vodka.
Cheerio and good luck.

7799 2018-12-26 06:41:57 Landed cost of fuel is a better input.
The crude oil has to be refined. AGO or PMS is just a fraction of crude oil.
7800 2018-12-26 06:41:40 Hey you lot, how are you all? Woke up with a hurty throat, but have put the oil of olbas on my cuffs, taken the capsules of healing, and drinking the tea of soothing. Later will take some magical hot purple juice to help.

7813 2018-12-26 06:39:40 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Los Angeles sleeps.
7814 2018-12-26 06:39:40 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Pittsburgh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
7815 2018-12-26 06:39:32 I have to get an oil change today.

7817 2018-12-26 06:38:56 independent research states that once the President abolishes a crucial regulation, a true #Christian dreams about being a #Democrat
7818 2018-12-26 06:38:53 Burning the midnight oil now, but such an enjoyable three days of celebrating Christmas. Most enjoyable holiday in over a decade for me personally. Never take for granted the times with family, hope you guys enjoyed it equally.
7819 2018-12-26 06:38:52 Bio oil boi haha
7820 2018-12-26 06:38:24 What exactly do you mean by "oil is from dinosaur bones?"
7821 2018-12-26 06:38:11 Exactly- so at 50% variable crude cost, a corresponding 43% drop in that cost should translate to at least a 20% drop in the overall crude price (its slightly higher as recent high oil price have increased the proportionate weight of crude price) 20% off a price of 117 = 23 bob.
7822 2018-12-26 06:37:55 I then seen the same oil spill on 6 different pictures.. y’all going in at cefco huh?

7827 2018-12-26 06:37:35 Save this rationalization for the rubes. Mr. Sirota's "simplification" of the individual donor/industry PAC issue as well as his hype of the second-in-the-nation for oil support is tailored for a fundamental narrative dishonesty. He left out the parts that ruined his hype.

7840 2018-12-26 06:35:15 The stat is about the terminal.
Pipelines are safer, more efficient, and better than truck or train for transporting oil. The stat shows the terminal is safe too.

7845 2018-12-26 06:34:54 Crude can crash upto $ 40, sell on every rise .. winter almost over there is no demand for burning oil nor crude !!!
7846 2018-12-26 06:34:48 Maybe in 100 years. Still many undiscovered oil fields + newer fracking technology + new green energy EVs will soon make oil obsolete for vehicles. Oil will be used for polymers etc. for a long time still, but recycling will lower demand.  Oil to $15-20 bbl is more realistic.
7847 2018-12-26 06:34:22 Imagine we had good leaders that have sense we would have been a tremendously great Nation coupled with our oil.
7848 2018-12-26 06:34:20 COMEX BRIEF :
Oil prices were mixed in thin trading on Wednesday as the U.S. benchmark rebounded from steep losses in the previous session, even though concern over the health of the global economy continued to overshadow the market in the longer term.
7849 2018-12-26 06:34:09 kleverunya oil kah? Kalo aku pake sesudah serum/essence baru ke tekstur skincare yang lebih berat kayak moisturizer baru krim malem
7850 2018-12-26 06:34:02 All of these are super valid questions by the way. Why bring up pipelines? They threaten whole water ways and giant aquifers. If all our water gets contaminated with crude oil, we’re not the only knes who will suffer and die. Animals will as well. So that’s why that is relevant.

7865 2018-12-26 06:29:58 Instead of coming at us, what are you doing to curb the way this country exploits animals en masse on a daily basis? What are you doing about all the pollution that goes into the ocean? What are you doing about oil pipelines being built when oil conpanies are breaking laws?

7903 2018-12-26 06:23:43 Last time we did the numbers - 2 years ago- we estimated approx 6 to 8 shillings was not being passed through via pump prices. We all later came to know it is because of 'oil spillage' ya KP

7905 2018-12-26 06:23:02 Socialism bankrupted the country, killed off its productivity, they became increasingly reliant on oil exports, oil crashed. To make up for the loss in revenue they printed an assload of money which through the country into hyper inflation. And a myriad of other problems.

7920 2018-12-26 06:19:37 No. Why is Canada buying oil from out of country when they have their own?
Why give those jobs to other people in other countrys when instead people need them at home?
7921 2018-12-26 06:19:23 But even so- the price adjustment lag is suspiciously low. Oil closed Oct 34% lower, Adjusting prices in mid-Jan( assuming there will be a favorable one then), nearly 80 days later can't be justifiable.
7922 2018-12-26 06:19:17 Diesel will see a significant decrease on 15 Jan.
Do note that as @WehliyeMohamed said the decrease is only on the OIL input of the formula. Taxes remain the same.

7945 2018-12-26 06:14:24 Expecting Turkey to eradicate ISIS is as ridiculous as expecting Iran to eradicate Hezbollah. Before Kurds w. the coalition’s help began to push ISIS town after town, ISIS controlled most of  border and they were partners w/the Turks. Flow of Oil & jihadists went uninterrupted.
7946 2018-12-26 06:14:06 Iran is predicted to export 1.5 million barrels of oil per day (bpd) next year, starting from 21 March 2019, according to spokesman for presiding board of the Iranian Parliament, Behrouz Nemati.

7951 2018-12-26 06:13:16 No he does not have a "great record on voting for the environment". He has voted for the continuation of offshore drilling and to increase exports of oil (more fracking, drilling). 

His coziness with Wall Street is another red flag. IMO, no way do I support this guy.
7952 2018-12-26 06:13:03 Zangeneh maintained that the government has envisaged the price of each barrel of oil at $54 for the next year's national budget bill.

7954 2018-12-26 06:12:37 And what about the crude oil prices in the international market? Link the petrol prices with the crude oil prices too!
7955 2018-12-26 06:12:29 If this is the case the Labor party should stop accepting donations from big oil and mining companies. Develop some backbone and integrity.
7956 2018-12-26 06:12:20 Minister of Petroleum Bijan Zangeneh says Iran’s budget is the least tied to oil production among OPEC Member States, adding the country’s macro policy is to cut down dependency on oil revenues.

7959 2018-12-26 06:11:52 The paper referenced by The Guardian makes some extremely sketchy and unwarranted extrapolations based on comparing almonds to oilseed production, which doesn’t make any sense, We’re making almond milk, not almond oil.

8011 2018-12-26 06:05:21 Add some baking soda and lavender essential oil, if you have it!  2 cups epsom salts, 1 cup baking soda, and 12-16 drops of lavender oil.

8027 2018-12-26 06:02:20 Just because much of “Canada’s” lucrative oil fields are located in Alberta doesn’t entitle Alberta to be the only province to benefit from the riches.  All provinces are entitled to enjoy some benefit from Canadian resources, thus one of the basis of Equalization?

8032 2018-12-26 06:00:30 The price component that changes with global oil prices is becoming smaller by the day due to the ever increasing taxes. What is the taxes & levy component now? 60 percent? And then the remaining 40 percent has transport etc factors. Weights bro!

8035 2018-12-26 05:59:54 まあ発売から時間経ってたからね...
8036 2018-12-26 05:59:50 Yeah, it's a bitch when a Gr 10 education won't get you $150 g's a year anymore, thanks to world oil prices tanking.
8037 2018-12-26 05:59:37 Ol'Bob sez...Robert DiNiro didn't he use to be famous or something ? Didn't his career die years ago, yet he thinks people care what he has to say...fact is NO ONE cares what he has to say, I'd rather change the oil on my tractor, than listen to him!!!!
8038 2018-12-26 05:59:31 That is a lot of residual oil
8039 2018-12-26 05:59:14 It's only "the exact metric" if u regard taking of oil $ and taking of defence $ as equally bad. U may, but I don't.
8040 2018-12-26 05:59:09 Does anybody know how to get grease/oil off of a poster? Please help!!

I folded a poster up for a few weeks and opened it and there are grease stains on it now??
8041 2018-12-26 05:59:07 Or that he violated his pledge not to take oil money.
8042 2018-12-26 05:58:58 Who have made use of  whale oil   19-20th centuries originally in the first place?
8043 2018-12-26 05:58:33 โยเกิร์ตใช้รสธรรมชาตินะคะ เอาเย็นๆพอกให้ทั่วหน้า ถ้ามีอโวคาโดสุกบดละเอียด ใช้หลังช้อนก็ได้ ผสมลงไป ใส่น้ำมะนาว น้ำผึ้งเล็กน้อย ทาทั่วหน้า ส่วน Evening Primrose Oil ,Acaiberryและ Collagen นุชทานแบบเม็ดทั้งหมด สะดวก
8044 2018-12-26 05:58:31 Yes, that’s valuable context. Also valuable context is the nature of the donations. These types of larger donations clearly suggest the contributions are of oil/gas execs.  That holds more weight in this discussion if we’re all being really honest
8045 2018-12-26 05:58:28 making an essential oil brand called "homeschool poppers"
8046 2018-12-26 05:58:09 I got a bluetooth sleeping mask and an essential oil diffuser for xmas. And let me tell you. Tomorrow is a new day. A great day. 
8047 2018-12-26 05:58:04 "It's ok to sometimes vote with Trump and the oil folks when the fate of life on Earth is at stake."
8048 2018-12-26 05:58:03 And the fact DCI finals have been here the pst few years the marching band stuff is top notch and fun to go to at Lucas Oil. 

I’m biased in saying this though.
8049 2018-12-26 05:57:21 Yeah, that's the word, there was a time..
All our Leaders keep clamoring on is Crude oil since its their major source of Looting funds.
8050 2018-12-26 05:57:20 @NASA just tell everyone there’s oil on Mars, you’ll get funding quicker than @realDonaldTrump can run our country into the ground
8051 2018-12-26 05:56:40 my best christmas present was vanilla essential oil i am sleeping like a high little hog tonight
8052 2018-12-26 05:56:28 They didn’t consult, it was shelved. The company weighed waiting for the proper consultation vs. investing somewhere else. With the current Alberta oil prices, they leaned toward somewhere else. Canada doesn’t have that luxury, we need the pipeline. BC is fighting though :(
8053 2018-12-26 05:56:03 Jawab la weiiiiiiii

masa kau bayar RM2.20/liter time crude oil melambung, kau ada bising tak ?
8054 2018-12-26 05:55:57 There was a time when we were the world's largest producer of crude oil
8055 2018-12-26 05:55:46 That's a good point. It's also probably healthier for you rather than frying in oil.
8056 2018-12-26 05:55:39 dear god i need a straight IV of CBD and lavender oil to get through this anxiety
8057 2018-12-26 05:54:59 買っとこ
8058 2018-12-26 05:54:56 Everything has always been abought the Americans wanting to control all energy resources to tell every country where they have to get their supplies of gas and oil from They even over throw govs. to accomplish this, also with sanctions that cripple economies. The world will rebel
8059 2018-12-26 05:54:43 But we depend solely on oil.. Are we wise like this?
8060 2018-12-26 05:54:34 they also now own most of Venezuela's oil
8061 2018-12-26 05:54:32 My mom put an oil diffuser in every bedroom of our house along with various essential oils (chamomile, lavender, vanilla, jasmine, ylang ylang, and peppermint) to help us sleep, relieve stress, and rid of anxiety. She’s the best. I can’t wait to grow up & be like her.
8062 2018-12-26 05:54:13 these amazon face masks have such wonderful variety including:

8065 2018-12-26 05:53:38 By the same exact metric that you’re using to accuse Beto of taking oil money, that individual donations count as industry donations, Bernie has taken just as much from the defense industry. 

Beto took zero PAC money or big donations from companies. That’s a fact.
8066 2018-12-26 05:53:30 And it's a lie - typical from #Comey , since public employees were paid on December 15 and will (probably) be paid on December 30....let's see how quickly they achieve an agreement before the weekend is over......

8072 2018-12-26 05:52:55 He took the 2nd most from the oil and gas industry, employees or not. That was the story. That was true. That concerns a lot of people when facing cataclysmic climate change. Why is that so hard for you to get?
8073 2018-12-26 05:52:38 "we would not be in the middle east were it not for Israeli interests" .... You misspelled "Oil"

8078 2018-12-26 05:52:01 It still needs context. His Oil & Gas receipts are in line with other Senators. They’re bigger but that’s expected bc Tx is highly populated, oil & gas are prominent there, & it was a highly contested race. And he raised 72 million overall which was far ahead of everyone else.
8079 2018-12-26 05:51:59 I got an oil diffuser today. Watch out depression and anxiety, the oils are coming for you.

Who will get profits, decide on production levels, etc...

(Don’t get my question wrong, I’m all for America being self-subsisting with oil & gas, I just want to know who is in charge of this...)

Thanks for asking me to clarify...
8089 2018-12-26 05:49:37 Beto drinks oil instead of coffee every morning. Saw it on this website
8090 2018-12-26 05:49:21 They always are... The way they took this act out, it was clear what their motive was.. Wonder if they knew why they were killing him!

8094 2018-12-26 05:48:48 Soooo I used coconut oil to take off my make up and I've discovered these Paul Mitchell cleansing facial bars....y'all! My face is soooooooo soft and so clean.

8097 2018-12-26 05:48:31 Peppermint oil is my best friend currently
8098 2018-12-26 05:48:03 Lime pickle, that is, a certain brand of lime pickle, no oil lots of heat and tangy, is also wonderful on top of vanilla ice cream. It was one of the first things I could taste after a devastating head injury and has been my touchstone for taste sensibility since. Delicious.
8099 2018-12-26 05:47:49 HAHAHAHA!

Arvin, you ain't the only one on paid vacation, Mr. Preacher cum Pastor. I've been on paid vacation since December 6th from my oil & gas job. I don't go back to work till January 2nd. For my other job, college doesn't resume till Janaury 14, so I'm great!
8100 2018-12-26 05:47:48 What is the oil ? How do we see  if it is there or still there?
8101 2018-12-26 05:47:38 If there be anyone that deserve this morning oil of love from me is you sir,
May my oil of love go with you throughout today, because you are the first to put smile on face this day, an early morning smile of joy for each day shall never depart from thee.
8102 2018-12-26 05:47:30 Koch bros, fighting the need for corporate welfare like super heroes...of course these super heroes appear to have limited sight! Oil and gas subsidies are invisible to thier eye...archaic and self serving thinking from them and all like them! Shameful!!
8103 2018-12-26 05:47:28 i put some night calming/sleep oil in my new diffuser & put it beside the bed, go in the living room for NO more than 10 mins & come back in the bedroom & dylan is KNOCKED,even the dogs were snoring, i think this is gonna be my fav gift & most used #SleepingHubbyHappyWife

8106 2018-12-26 05:46:56 Why would price of oil “rebounding” be a good thing?
8107 2018-12-26 05:46:43 It's not the excess supply that is the issue though, it's that we only have one buyer. We only have one buyer because Ndp and liberal policies have crushed every pipeline from being built. So yes Canada can control the price of our oil to an extent.
8108 2018-12-26 05:46:36 32counces of sour cream, 5Lbs of butter, full cup of coconut oil. 2 XL bulbs of garlic, 2 quarts of heavy whipping cream. 22Lb turky. 9Lb rib roast. entire sack of potatoes... enough salt to kill a horse. fucking so happy. I miss big cooking BIG meals

8114 2018-12-26 05:45:46 Fascinating....but it’s not about just shipping, it’s about Aframax Oil Tankers loaded down with 650 009 barrels of toxic, flammable sludge with the hazards to the sensitive marine ecosystem and the lands and coastline where these tankers will be sailing.
8115 2018-12-26 05:45:44 Right? Oil changes for me are classic. I only think of this at 8pm “remind me next Tuesday to get an oil change” boom. I may not get it done then, but at least I can defrag my brain ;)

8129 2018-12-26 05:43:37 US indices are highly oversold ,Technically if any relief rally comes ,that will also be 2-3+% move in a day ,So short positions should be taken only on rallies in #Indian markets ,Since we have Oil advantage which will lead to Equally strong rally.

8133 2018-12-26 05:42:19 The money comes from us you numbskull. We pay for ECERYTHING already. It's just not going to our General Welfare. It's going to corporate tax cuts, endless wars, oil subsidies.

Can you go away now. Or I'll be forced to mute you.
8134 2018-12-26 05:42:16 Yeah oil leak is bearable but fuel leak is different level already. Found candidates for the new car?
8135 2018-12-26 05:41:57 This reminds me of the time my sister called for help putting oil into her car (the light was on).  She said it was taking for ever because the hole was so small.  She was pouring it in the dipstick hole.

8140 2018-12-26 05:41:49 Won’t be surprised if they prayed for low price.....with the oil price rally above $60 for last 12 months they had no clue what to do with it, with things getting even worse.
8141 2018-12-26 05:41:43 And a lot of this is due to Trump. Polar bears will go next As Trump is going to allow five different oil companies to explore in polar bear territory I'd like to say what I think should be done to this man but I'd probably have the FBI knocking on my door

8144 2018-12-26 05:41:14 All these ‘nuke Japan again’ comments are pretty ironic. ‘General Douglas MacArthur encouraged the surrendered Japan to continue whaling in order to provide a cheap source of meat to starving people (and millions of dollars in oil for the US and Europe).

8156 2018-12-26 05:39:42 Right, the discussion is about individual large donors who are executives at oil companies. That's the pledge Beto made. He got removed from the list of candidates who made that pledge.

We will dominate in energy resources WORLDWIDE NOW!!
8167 2018-12-26 05:37:37 Right, and you're not an oil executive who donated over $200, correct?

8169 2018-12-26 05:37:29 If they are steamed, I totally agree. But have you ever roasted them in the oven with olive oil and garlic and a bit of salt? They are glorious. My super picky non veggie eating nephew will eat the hell out of brussel sprouts if I roast them.

8227 2018-12-26 05:28:03 All due respect, that’s illogical. Solar and wind power will eventually replace oil, and oil production requires more human staff to produce. So should we not go green?

New technology always produces new job areas. Humans will always be needed, just in different areas.

8237 2018-12-26 05:26:32 Bhai earlier fuel prices were not linked with crude prices. Further, UPA govt left behind unpaid oil bond of 1.3 lakh crore. So there's no free lunch. Either you pay now or later. Modi govt not only cleared accumulated UPA dues but also brought OMC back into profit.
8238 2018-12-26 05:26:29 75% of those donations were "large" ($>200) including 24 oil and gas executives. People who give large donations tend to be higher up in the companies, not mail clerks. You don't think these people are trying to buy influence?

8306 2018-12-26 05:12:30 @DoubleEph @ayosogunro @FinPlanKaluAja @cchukudebelu The sad truth about Nigeria is that as long as the government relies more on oil rents and not the people (taxes) for revenues, the people will lack a voice - government doesn't need them anyways.
8307 2018-12-26 05:12:28 Or they have mastered their skin with The Force? When it gets cold my hands do not like it, even in Seattle! Rest of the skin isn’t so happy either. I’ve been using a body oil after I shower and it seems to help.
8308 2018-12-26 05:12:28 Slice some onions ,dice tomatoes and set aside. Was and dry sebete it it tends to hold a lot of water. Season it before cooking this helps it retain the salt sebete se dingalo. Pour a bit of oil in the pan and cook until brown. Add the onion first then the tomatoes and cook

8310 2018-12-26 05:12:09 Breakfast idea! Saute onion in olive oil and garlic until fragrant. Add pork mince and shallots and white wine. Cook thoroughly. Serve with spaghetti and a bit of diced tomatoes.

8314 2018-12-26 05:11:32 I'm fact the other day I had some pasta with oil, garlic, parmesan, crushed chilis and lemon juice. Completely unplanned.
8315 2018-12-26 05:11:31 Just think, a decade ago we all believed that oil was about to run out.
8316 2018-12-26 05:11:26 Beto has deep ties to oil & gas. Not supporting Sanders here, but Beto should be looked at more carefully.
8317 2018-12-26 05:11:15 I never said Russia was socialist, they are communist, Venezuela is socialist and there country as big oil supply and is bankrupt in 5 years do to socialism!
It may work in the beginning of a socialistic path, the governments run out of money quickly, socialism doesn’t work long!

8322 2018-12-26 05:10:01 It’s all tied together because the rich folks mine the oil and war the oil but dependency on fossil fuels must change and I’m afraid it won’t if politicians are dependent on oil money and all that’s connected
8323 2018-12-26 05:09:59 I was using a water bottle off my nightstand to fill up my oil diffuser  and after it ran out I went to fill it up again and noticed that I was filling up my oil diffuser with fucking alcohol so then I realized Ive been breathing in vaporized alcohol for the past hour and a half
8324 2018-12-26 05:09:50 You’re the one protecting the snake oil salesman so it’s kind of funny.

8331 2018-12-26 05:08:17 So, Oil executives are perfect rational people who can't have a daughter with a terminal illness in need of health care, or an aging parents who lives with them with skyrocking medical bills who are okay voting against their interests because they have greater concerns?

8338 2018-12-26 05:07:02 I'm a fan of Sirota's and have been for many years. But I thought that referenced post was misleading and disingenuous, too. Beto clearly raked in lots of oil and gas $$$, but not large contributions from CEOs and PACs. It was lots of small donations.

8342 2018-12-26 05:06:11 It's not about buying votes, it shows that these politicians have already voted a certain way, or seem likely to vote a certain way, so oil executives want to support them. Can you imagine an oil exec or banking exec wanting to donate to Bernie? Of course not.
8343 2018-12-26 05:05:42 That's a lot of people's voice you're seeing, he should fear Allah and stop this, for a day will come when he shall account for it in the presence of his creator.
8344 2018-12-26 05:05:10 Are these rates even comparable??.  In sept 2013 price of crude oil was $108 and today price has fallen to $46.
8345 2018-12-26 05:04:42 Completely agree with you sir. But who can explain to the idiots who refuse to understand the simple but most effective truth expounded by the Quaid E Azam. Water and oil don't mix.

Ranging from seaports to oil companies having HQ in Lagos when their source of income is located in the SS.
8359 2018-12-26 05:01:55 [deeply disingenuous at best] The man took the maximum allowed amount of money $2,500 from over 30 oil exuctive. That's a very real undeniable concrete fact,  you don't have to like that it's a fact but it is a fact.

8362 2018-12-26 05:01:08 Fine, but let's recognize that the $30 donations make up less than 25% of his total. The average donation was $420. Over twenty oil industry executives maxed out.

8368 2018-12-26 05:00:13 @ETNOWlive Indian domestic consumer does not benefit from lower global prices of crude oil. Rather, it's the money gobbling govt that's getting a windfall by raising taxes and excise duty.

8376 2018-12-26 04:58:26 Glad you mentioned the incense. Aromatherapy has helped me a lot. Used to think the essential oil stuff was a hoax, but it works. It’s amazing how a scent can get you out of a funk. For me orange, grapefruit and peppermint oils particularly worked for me.

8391 2018-12-26 04:56:20 Reason given for fall & myths :
1. Crude oil raise - but now it fell below 50
2. US rate hike will make USD gain against INR - now USD fell below 70
3. US bond market gain - but now it started going down
4. In a bull($hit) market correct is due - it is range bound now....

8432 2018-12-26 04:48:44 Texas Oil and Gas corporations can donate through PACs. That would say something about Beto. Not garage mechanics and mid-level managers. (And Bernie gets a lot of contributions from people in Finance, Defense Aerospace, etc.)

8439 2018-12-26 04:47:33 I ain't been here long enough to speak about/defend some of the political issues? What's next? That I'm not qualified to have the job that I have at one of the biggest oil & gas servicing companies out there? That I'm not qualified to be an Adjunct Professor at a university?
8440 2018-12-26 04:47:27 But are you an executive for an oil company? Because Beto receiving large donations from executives is the issue, not from ordinary employees. That's why he is no longer on the list of those pledging to not take oil money.
8441 2018-12-26 04:47:26 2... -The one with the essential oil aroma diffuser?

8446 2018-12-26 04:46:18 You don’t know wtf you’re even talking about. You are NEVER going to convince #progressives to vote for a gas & oil industry puppet like Beto.  And by the way, more of Bernie’s supporters voted for Hillary than hers did for Obama.

8449 2018-12-26 04:46:11 Check your Engine oil this Sunday.
8450 2018-12-26 04:46:06 And he received 6x that amount from Educators.  So, what evil motive do they have?  The total amount from Oil Industry employees is very low on list of Industries donors work for.
8451 2018-12-26 04:46:00 Well I had box dye, my oil slick and my purple before she bleached me, so it was around $200 ish
8452 2018-12-26 04:45:52 I agree, Powell and Co. is not looking at the data, but just following the path that was preordained.  Inflation path of least resistance is down with oil and trade.  No need for interest rate hikes.

8456 2018-12-26 04:44:09 What is the best album of 2018 and why is it SOPHIE's Oil of Every Pearl's Un-Insides
8457 2018-12-26 04:44:02 LOL. With permission of Kurds? You mean with the permission of the US. Assad the coward never dared to attack East Syria despite all the oil resources located there, instead he tried to attack the much less significant Idlib to harm Turkey's interests. He's a Yanki tool.
8458 2018-12-26 04:43:41 The Witcher:
It was a rainy day in Kaer Morhen. Vesemir was teaching new recruits about  Botchlings. 'Use Cursed Oil against them', he said, 'It'll make your jobs easier'.
8459 2018-12-26 04:43:36 Ok Christmas was fun but tomorrow begins Operation: Get This Baby The Fuck Out ASAP. We are walking, squatting, and dancing. We are eating an entire pineapple and washing it down with a glass of hot sauce. And if all else fails, it’s castor oil time. Pray 4 me 
8460 2018-12-26 04:43:29 I just got lavender oil in my eye that was the most painful shit to ever happen to me
8461 2018-12-26 04:43:26 We are doing the work of God, who knows, maybe they'll be reformed via myself, and I'll gain countless rewards
8462 2018-12-26 04:43:24 Last time the shop changed my oil, which was about four months ago mind you, they forgot to put a sticker on

8467 2018-12-26 04:42:46 If you’re not taking your makeup off with coconut oil, idk what you’re doing. 
8468 2018-12-26 04:42:46 I can't stand mutton. when it's your chore to kill the house & dog mutton. then eat it just about every day , then you question it. there"s better meats. & wool is a boutique market now ?. camel & goat are markets in Indonesia270 mill. & try middle east-swap for oil.
8469 2018-12-26 04:42:30 It costs these thieves R2.71 to produce a litre of fuel. Add the fuel levy of R 5,80 then petrol shouldn’t cost more than R8,00 a liter. Yet Sasol’s fuel price is pinned to the oil price even if they make petrol from coal. #Disgusting #Racists
8470 2018-12-26 04:41:50 Why believe such a statement? The intel we got of WMDs was a lie, for example. The true objectives were clear once the results came in: Israel's oil imports were ensured by Iraqi Kurds and SA avoided competing with a stable Iraq as an oil exporter. And that's that.
8471 2018-12-26 04:41:32 จะบล๊อคแล้วนะ
8472 2018-12-26 04:41:29 Ohhh bih an oil diffuser will get you right!!!
8473 2018-12-26 04:41:08 Oil prices were mixed in thin trading on Wednesday as the U.S. benchmark rebounded from steep losses in the previous session, even though concern over the health of the global economy continued to overshadow the market in the longer term.
8474 2018-12-26 04:40:54 @AbeShinzo whaling is barbaric, shame on Japan! Please do not resume commercial whaling, the earth's whale populations are already imperiled by pollution, shipping traffic, underwater noise, oil and gas exploration and drilling, and climate change. 
No whaling. #SaveTheWhales

Dan ga bs pake micellar water sama sabun aja, harus pake balm/oil cleanser
8481 2018-12-26 04:40:08 It would show that the president is not above the law and we still hold our nation as one that is ruled by laws.

The nation is already in term oil thanks to him. I'm fine with the last push through a bit more if we come out the other side with our values intact.

8492 2018-12-26 04:37:49 A damn oil change lol
8493 2018-12-26 04:37:48 I got an oil diffuser and a tea pot for Christmas and I’m so excited to start using them 
8494 2018-12-26 04:37:44 Big oil/gas ruthless, greedy and destructive!
8495 2018-12-26 04:37:35 … he banna! go peyitiwa (sp, as in the traditional procedure to perform colon cleansing) is still a thing after 1994? Tjo! That process, as far as I and my family are concerned was/is a violation of human rights (so is castor oil).” 1ove, rights.
8496 2018-12-26 04:37:27 Haha. Well the terminal came loose after trying to jump my old car, but the oil has leaked for a long while and needs fixed.
8497 2018-12-26 04:37:12 They are going for the record apparently. Sorry whales.

The intense whale hunting drove the number of sperm whales down appreciably. It's estimated that nearly 236,000 whales were killed in the 19th century alone. And then, in 1846, the industry reached peak sperm whale oil.
8498 2018-12-26 04:37:12 You got an oil one???
8499 2018-12-26 04:36:43 has anyone here tried cbd oil for anxiety? does it work?
8500 2018-12-26 04:36:37 Buat apa mas itu virgin oil khusus nya??

Pernah minum 1 botol kecil, gada reaksi apa", cuma efek sampingnya kalau gak pas minum nya, mencret 
8501 2018-12-26 04:36:33 I’m simmering it and then I’m going to chop it up and make a cold salad with celery, lemon juice, black olives, good olive oil, s and p
8502 2018-12-26 04:36:10 Bruh this guy seriously isn’t human . 

Looks like it’s time for an oil change
8503 2018-12-26 04:35:17 This was a dumb article. 1. We should promote EV. Isis and other groups get money from big oil. 2. Most EV bought in states are made in states. The tax credit should be for EV made in US. You should want coal up more American jobs!!  And when trucks come out be a big push. Go USA
8504 2018-12-26 04:34:49 Makahappy ang mang inasal diri sa san ped kay naay chicken oil. Yayyyy!!!
8505 2018-12-26 04:34:31 I make a Neem oil soap and body butter that helps tremendously!!
8506 2018-12-26 04:34:19 vape oil. Please I must see
8507 2018-12-26 04:34:13 Beto is not that person. He's tainted by the money. Anyone who takes money from oil, prisons, Wall Street, pharma, weapons is the enemy. It's the money that matters.
8508 2018-12-26 04:34:09 Hoping the best! Is it just not starting? Gas or oil? If gas try replacing the ignitor
8509 2018-12-26 04:34:08 Because you think $2500 donations from individuals in charge of oil companies are what influences politicians?
8510 2018-12-26 04:34:01 #ModiAasuchanti

8512 2018-12-26 04:33:38 True but to say that oil wasn’t a major factor in the war misses what Bush and his families business is all about. Also to say that capitalism hasn’t toppled governments in incorrect. Plus it has put the US at the brink twice and once Trump is done-watch out. #iknow
8513 2018-12-26 04:33:23 But also Gwen Paltrow is an objectively bad person who is a snake oil salesperson so I’m kind of ok with her getting steamrolled
8514 2018-12-26 04:33:06 เห็นด้วยคับ
8515 2018-12-26 04:32:52 Omg you poor thing! Burn it with holy oil!
8516 2018-12-26 04:32:39 I'm waiting to hear that part about the 'oil' factor and who is interested in Sudan crude oil.
8517 2018-12-26 04:32:38 thirsty for oil
8518 2018-12-26 04:32:28 Subpar piece of journalism. The article is justifying Bush/Cheney’s administration tactics because the Obama administration either used those tactics or did something just as bad. Or fluffed the idea that Iraq couldn’t be a oil money grab because Dems and Tony Blair back’d it.
8519 2018-12-26 04:31:36 Ima leave em steak and motor oil just cause you said all that.
8520 2018-12-26 04:31:35 The Kurds in Northern Syria and Iraq for their oil fields.
8521 2018-12-26 04:31:21 Let me tell you something,the way I minced garlic so fine, pre-heat extra virgin olive oil(not too hot)add anchovies that melt away. You cook spaghetti then add everything w/chopped black olives&tons of grated Parmesan cheese. You never see anchovies&never guess in recipe
8522 2018-12-26 04:31:19 We all know @JustinTrudeau government penalized every province with the carbon tax, so they can call themselves environmentally friendly government then buys the pipeline so they can hold off on the project. But continues to buys oil overseas. Go figure.
8523 2018-12-26 04:31:13 *oil money
8524 2018-12-26 04:31:05 it truly was a great christmas night -- @WWEBigE was just rubbing oil all over himself (probably stealing the idea from @FinnBalor) while on commentary on the Christmas Edition (tm) of #SDLive

8532 2018-12-26 04:29:16 Tesla is noted for its electric cars but the most significant development may be in energy storage.  This will impact electric energy producers, oil producers and coal producers. Storing renewable energy has been the missing link.

8534 2018-12-26 04:28:46 Japan has very little respect for the environment.
I am surprised trump does not bring back using Whale oil for street lights, he is so in love with FUCKING coal.
I worked 6 years in a coal mine and these jobs that he talks about saving, most coal miners would prefer he didn't.
8535 2018-12-26 04:28:44 Nope, Kurdistan oil benefits mostly the Kurds, Israel and Saudi Arabia. We went there to destroy Saddam's control over the oil and ensure that SA would retain its oil exportation hegemony. Those were the primary objectives, what you're arguing was just an insignifavnt perk.

8543 2018-12-26 04:28:06 My favorite present I got was literally this bracelet my mom got me that you can put lavender essential oil in. It’s such a simple gift but it made me so happy. That really shows how much she knows me.
8544 2018-12-26 04:27:56 ししまるさんおはよ～(*´ω｀*)
8545 2018-12-26 04:27:56 What's your favorite stock? Mine is $NVDA. What is the catalyst for Nvidia? It's BTC. Maybe some like $MPC. US oil refining capacity is at 100% forever with no new plants. Or maybe we have a $AMZN, since wages are not rising, Xmas is over, what is the catalyst for anything?
8546 2018-12-26 04:27:53 Those are always left for us (The Men) to wash and repolish (ka fish oil), before packing them away.
8547 2018-12-26 04:27:44 The idea that Iraq was toppled by a grab for oil ignores a basic understanding of post-Cold War geopolitics and American foreign policy. Even if true, a socialist Baathist regime’s grab for oil in the ‘90s led to a coalition take over. #BeenThereDoneThat
8548 2018-12-26 04:27:42 Imma learn how to change my oil via YouTube. Let me get some tools though.
8549 2018-12-26 04:27:38 But hey, Steve Bushemi plays an incredibly accurate oil company field geophysicist. He’d rather be whoring and honkeytonking.
8550 2018-12-26 04:27:31 lou kinda sound like oil if ur like very drunk, so thats why
8551 2018-12-26 04:27:31 Those track donations by individuals working in those industries, which are major employers in Texas. Sirota said they were “oil and gas industry donations,” which is misleading.
8552 2018-12-26 04:27:28 What's a good essential oil for cursing my enemies?
8553 2018-12-26 04:27:23 Wish I didn't have to get a new battery and this oil leak fixed I'd go shopping
8554 2018-12-26 04:27:22 Again, the only reason I lump them in is because they don't separate those out. I'm not "focused" on them. You're focusing on them because you think it's a flaw in the logic. 

Say it back to me: I don't separate the $2000 donations from the oil industry because....?
8555 2018-12-26 04:27:20 なるほど、そういうことだったんですね！
8556 2018-12-26 04:27:15 Most likely inspired by Trump looking the other way or he setting the White House up to go back to whale oil lamps.
8557 2018-12-26 04:27:09 A Car after Sex?

Who does that? 

Even if you can drill Crude oil inside her Pussy, you still have to drill more, deeper and consistently. Then we talk about processing it. 

Just one round of sex?

That means if you go for Round 2, you'll buy a Private Jet?

8562 2018-12-26 04:26:06 And? This doesn't say anything except Beto raised $492,620, less than 5%, of his total fundraising from people who worked for the oil and gas industry (as he didn't take any corporate money)
8563 2018-12-26 04:26:04 พูดใด้ดีครับ
8564 2018-12-26 04:25:55 Fast started hours ago. Liquids, salts, and MCT oil is the menu. Don’t know how many days yet. Just going to see how it goes. Probably will need apple cider vinegar as well to help with the carbohydrate crash. 

I might be irritable tomorrow. We’ll see! 
8565 2018-12-26 04:25:49 I can’t wait for Thursday oil change, deep clean, and some needed organizing.

8569 2018-12-26 04:24:48 Get ready for a tariff on lamp oil in Alaska. Our economy's screwed.
8570 2018-12-26 04:24:46 Maybe you can get your oil changed
8571 2018-12-26 04:24:20 Wouldn't that be true also for the C in oil that originated in sea life?  In other words the so called "pollution" by Libtards is just recirculation?

8575 2018-12-26 04:23:34 I'd gladly take MCT oil. Just saying. And the ketone meter would be fun academically but I wouldn't ask someone to spend $ on it for me.
8576 2018-12-26 04:23:17 So my cars inspection has been out since March and also needs an oil change, but I also am getting a new (to me) car in like a week so I’m just gonna continue on the path of destruction... poor little Saturn

8587 2018-12-26 04:21:36 But I can read the actual data and documentation. Scheer, Kenney and their ilk are pushing for a base of uninformed, angry bullies, who jump when they say oil. This is a process screwed up by the previous governments, both Conservative, yet there is no ownership of that.
8588 2018-12-26 04:21:22 It’s not oil industry money! It’s completely asinine to expect candidates to curate individual donors.

8593 2018-12-26 04:20:42 You pay an artist to design a Maserati; you pay a mechanic to change its oil.
8594 2018-12-26 04:20:36 Because he didn't take donations from executives in the oil and gas industry. Stop it. Why don't we litigate Bernie taking donations from defense aerospace contractors if that's what you have an issue with.
8595 2018-12-26 04:20:29 rubbed rose oil on my face so now its time to cook christmas dinner for myself and myself alone

8598 2018-12-26 04:20:00 he was not telling the truth.  sirota lied that beto was talking from the oil industry.  he knew the money came from individual employees.  he knew it was a lie.  other leftists repeating sirota knew, too. this is backfiring because ppl are finding out leftists are dishonest ppl.

8600 2018-12-26 04:19:44 I currently use a Harry’s razor and a British shave oil that only comes in a set. I’m so glad you know of another oil. I was struggling with what to do when mine runs out.

8603 2018-12-26 04:19:23 At least the oil industry isn't saying breathing the exhaust of their products are actually healthy and even recommended by doctors, can't say the same for tobacco.....

8605 2018-12-26 04:19:04 The relentless personal attacks on Sirota instead of debating the merits of Beto's votes in Congress say it all. Not to mention the fact that Beto continues to defend taking donations from executives in the oil & gas industry.

8610 2018-12-26 04:17:51 how many drops of oil do u put in a diffuser 
8611 2018-12-26 04:17:14 The oil & gas industry benefits from the same kind of doubt with diesel that the tobacco industry did in the 70s, they are merchant of doubt and death.
8612 2018-12-26 04:17:13 It can if the right nations understand that gold is massively mispriced in USD terms by a gargantuan paper market, and use the oil market to arb the situation.
8613 2018-12-26 04:17:00 So Beto is disqualified for having less than 1% of his contributions coming from oil employees. But Bernie is allowed to take the same plus tons of money from defense contractors? Double standard much. You guys are so full of shit. Lol.
8614 2018-12-26 04:17:00 I got an oil diffuser to help me sleep and I’m in heaven right now

8655 2018-12-26 04:11:14 What on Earth are you talking about? That thread has nothing to do w/ the military contractors or the gun lobby. That's literally a thread about the *5 or 6* donations from ppl working in the oil industry. 5 or 6. Out of 10s of 1000s. Are you embarrassing yourself on purpose?
8656 2018-12-26 04:10:54 Well, I don't even know what you were trying to say at all. Why insult me when I haven't done the same to you nor were any of my statements false? Just stating the facts to dissuade the propaganda lie that the U.S. went  to the Middle East for oil importation increases.

8680 2018-12-26 04:06:53 it does! the other thing i love about it, is you can use it to revive leftover fried foods to their crispness-- which has an added benefit of cooking out some grease in the process if they were oil fried originally.

8692 2018-12-26 04:05:35 of course it is. it's a form of ecological fallacy. it may be that all oil industry money came from executives and owners, or none of it. you cannot assume either way without disentangling the two, but this is exactly what the article David is criticising does

8720 2018-12-26 04:01:35 this spill is becoming EERILY similar to the Exxon Valdez spill back in 1989. Once we get this cleaned up, we won't build another OIL RIG.

8724 2018-12-26 04:01:24 I’ll be positively impressed if he makes a point of shedding himself of all $ that came from oil and gas execs. I do not expect it to happen but if it does I’ll be pleasantly surprised.

8736 2018-12-26 04:00:09 Beto comes from Texas. I GET that much of his Oil Money is individual donations from regular employees. Do you GET that much isn't all? Do you know *how* much? 

Beto couldn't even be arsed to campaign strongly against guns in Texas. Odds he will suddenly say the unpopular thing?
8737 2018-12-26 04:00:02 Lincoln will be turning over in his oil painting upon witnessing this.

8739 2018-12-26 03:59:52 I believe her point was that many ordinary folks work in the oil industry, because it's a source of jobs. they are no more complicit in climate change than anyone else who exists in this economy, which is run on fossil fuel
8740 2018-12-26 03:59:46 I especially like Pepperoni a la Roma. If you like peppers, capers, and parm it's just awesome.

Add enough oil for the bread to soak up--but not TOO much.

I love capers so I use a lot.

The peppers get so soft that you can spread them.

Wonderful on bread or pasta.
8741 2018-12-26 03:59:32 Canada produces its own oil and mostly sells it to the U.S. -- it doesn't need to import oil from Iraq. The U.S. actually produces its own oil and sells it to Canada along with Saudi Arabia.

8743 2018-12-26 03:59:22 As long as it doesn’t grow, oil is a steal

8745 2018-12-26 03:59:16 No. They're not. $ from a teacher is not $ from the teachers union or the "education industry." $ from a doctor isn't "healthcare industry" $. O'Rourke raised *MORE $ THAN ANYONE* in 2018. He was #2 w/ oil industry employees? He was #1 overall & from Texas!

8748 2018-12-26 03:58:42 UPA borrowed Rs1.40 lac cr agnst oil bond to keep oil price pegged at 2012-14 level .This loan was repaid by present Govt with intt of 70000/ cr.The Govt was also able to sidestep US ban on oil purchase from Iran thereby easing pressure on oil prices.

8752 2018-12-26 03:57:37 1. Make batter at least the night before for best rise.
2. Get pan ripping hot.
3. Add oil and get hot for ~10 minutes until it’s just about smoking.
4. Pull out of oven and quickly add batter as quickly as possible.
5. Don’t open the door again until time is up.

8758 2018-12-26 03:55:14 No disappointment. I’d never really disparage anyone’s dietary choices. You do what’s right for you. That said, I’d likely use vegetable oil rather than shortening.

8761 2018-12-26 03:54:19 This is based on data from when oil price was lower.  Also, it doesn't include Toyota Prius, which I bet would beat the corrolla on running cost.

8765 2018-12-26 03:53:24 No clue what you're saying. Iraqi oil top importers are China, India and the U.S. -- the first isn't our ally at all. You're saying that we took Iraqi oil and sold it to our allies and they in turn sold it to us? Or just that first part alone? There's no reason to believe either.
8766 2018-12-26 03:53:17 2) If you were at Vanguard or Blackrock, your flows have been uninterrupted.  My hypothesis is that we’ve seen 2-3 different waves in this cycle. Sep-Oct was a botched rebalance (IYK, growth-value, US-RoW), Oct-Nov was largely oil, Dec we’re seeing credit and Boomer redemptions

8786 2018-12-26 03:49:48 One way to square that circle might be to focus on carbon-negative EOR, using Allam cycle plants + DAC with their waste heat to sequester more C than is in the oil+gas they extract. Some profitable demonstration projects in that space would make a big difference.

8808 2018-12-26 03:45:49 Saudi, Russia, & U.S. Shale need higher oil prices long term.  WTI has gone from $75 to $42 in the same period.  This is different than what Saudi did to market in 15’.  Will their cuts promised in 18’ have the desired effect on price in 19??!  Putin and Saudi sheiks sure hope so

8830 2018-12-26 03:43:22 As a common consumer, I feel soyabean oil finds less favour in tradition cuisine. It emits fishy odour in the frying pan. No doubt the oil has nutritional value from its omega-3 content, only hydrogenation makes it acceptable in processed food products.
8831 2018-12-26 03:43:14 Learned this from a Roman priest 30 yrs back Pepperoni a la Roma

Saute red green yellow peppers over LOW heat 4 2 or 3 hours in virgin oil. Add caper juice & capers 2 taste

Breadcrumbs to soak up the oil
 
Mix with grated parm

Serve on white bread crusty & fresh from the oven

8846 2018-12-26 03:40:17 That makes no sense when, again, we did not receive any significant increase in Iraqi oil imports. We were always there to destroy Saddam's regime for Israel. That's why they provided false Intel that he had stockpiled WMDs. Israel receives 75% of its oil imports from Kurdistan.

8852 2018-12-26 03:39:56 One way to cut gas from our atmosphere is to reduce food waste. We live in a nation where 1 in 5 go hungry. Bros want to cut things like oil without researching how these businesses affect communities as a whole versus focusing on what CAN be done... NOW.

What was good enough for the Queens of Egypt was good enough for modern American women!

8870 2018-12-26 03:37:07 Oil inventories suggest oil price should be $60. Go look at history to show current inventories vs. past prices. I've seen a couple charts that suggest $60 to $62.
8871 2018-12-26 03:36:54 Is there a way that US / India can threaten with Invasion and make them stop Whaling? Can UN step in? People are going for war for Oil and all...
8872 2018-12-26 03:36:51 Whoda thunk buying a 10-yr at 3.20% or so was a good thing 6 mos ago when it looked like we were on our way to 4%+. Also, very rare to see Dollar AND Oil drop at same time. Gold rising proves that point

8897 2018-12-26 03:33:11 Hopefully everyone had a great Christmas Day!! I spent mine with family and couldn’t have asked for a better day.  Except for a minor oil fire while making onion rings, it was a stress-free day!
8898 2018-12-26 03:33:06 Funding the tyrants that give us oil as they commit mass murder. Looks alot like how the CIA propped up the regimes of murderous tyrants from WWII on. I guess trading lives for cash, oil, and influence just never goes out of style...
No matter how much we may wish it would

8902 2018-12-26 03:32:27 Our companies destroy their land through logging, mining & oil; our citizens demand drugs from them; our govt. led their coup. We created that migration. Take some personal responsibility for once in your ignorant life.

8904 2018-12-26 03:32:20 Good job  but don’t forget to clean water off your oil...
8905 2018-12-26 03:32:15 Renewable is not free! You have to convert wind, solar, water into energy. Even with all the money that’s been poured into renewables, how much of our energy use do they produce? 15% tops! We still need oil and coal to meet the world’s demand.
8906 2018-12-26 03:32:11 He didn’t take money from gas and oil PACs. He took money from individual donors who happen to work in those industries. Not the same.
8907 2018-12-26 03:32:11 Just saw a video of a giant spider shedding its skin. It was as horrifying as one would imagine. I'll be drenching my home in peppermint oil, as I hear that is supposed to keep them away. It's probably bullshit, but I need something to believe in.

8917 2018-12-26 03:30:33 What's disingenuous is that pretending because these donations came from employees they are something different from industry money, despite the fact that many of them are oil industry executives maxing out their donations to Beto.

Shit 'spills' out of your asshole every day but gets cleaned up. But not by you. Spills are part of life, it's what we do about them that counts.

The oil patch cleans spills up, you leftist assholes just leave your shit where it lies.

8927 2018-12-26 03:28:46 Unfortunately, Beto promised not to take money from oil executives and then he did. It was his own promise which he rapidly broke.
8928 2018-12-26 03:28:40 In the last 24 hrs there were a total of 7 oil product tankers in the ports of Quebec City and Montreal. Yet according to Quebec Premier François Legault, there is no social acceptability for oil in Quebec.

8985 2018-12-26 03:21:12 agree what you are seeing is momentum hunters destroying #oil into a thin year end. Inventories are only high because OPEC was tricked into over producing w/ assurances Iran would be 100% shut in..didnt happen.
physical correction well underway but oil is reactive not predictive.

8994 2018-12-26 03:19:56 Take your own advice and research why we are in Syria. Our occupation clearly does not have the humanitarian reasons you have repeatedly claimed. Its all about big oil and weapons manufacturer's monetary interests. Perhaps you are mired in the war machine's multi media tar sands.
8995 2018-12-26 03:19:55 The numbers I used were just to make a point, no idea what they are. But if it is two dozen execs at max and tons of donations under $200 then my point stands. Most of his oil donations were from regular Texans who happen to have oil industry jobs. Not what sirota is implying.

9005 2018-12-26 03:19:07 The price at the pump will spike in Oil rich AK. Its still $3.00 a gallon and now is gonna spike... Our GOP state leaders have failed the citizens but done very well for big oil! The state needs more money per barrel but the citizens cant handle any higher prices at the pump
9006 2018-12-26 03:19:00 The CCTV footage clearly shows panicked attackers, who just unloaded the gun randomly. There weren't any signs of trained killers which would be the case if the state committed the crime.

9022 2018-12-26 03:18:03 Had low gas prices been in the Trump agenda you might have a point. Clearly neocons/GOP are not happy about losing their control over the petro dollar and it's being used as a pressure point against Trump by big oil interests who have a lot of power over MSM.
9023 2018-12-26 03:18:03 I have no opinion, except that Israel or the United States should grab the oil- rich fields.

9034 2018-12-26 03:16:41 My LMT gave me a mixture of massage oil in a small pump bottle to use on my neck and trigger points. She used several different oils, including frankincense and myrrh. I really like the smell of frankincense and it seems to help if I apply it before bed.  #Christmas #Gifts

9046 2018-12-26 03:14:36 Ah, so we should all just ignore that certain candidates (we all know who is running, be fucking serious) are bought by the oil and gas industry and will ruthlessly sell out the environment. That’ll DEFINITELY make things better. And I’m a simp. Got it. 
9047 2018-12-26 03:14:30 Nope. And the answer is that there is no oil there.

9054 2018-12-26 03:12:53 2016 was a market share war. This is not the same thing. Equity capital draining is a bullish sign since CAPEX is going to be reduced both voluntarily and by demand from investors. OPEC is set to cut again and extend cuts if oil doesn't rebound quickly. Argus predicts $80 brent.

If you got any leftover ham & you like cauliflower, mince the cauliflower florets very fine & mince the ham.

Sautee the ham a little in olive oil with pepper and then mix in the minced florets and saute until just done.

Mix w parm. Eat!

9070 2018-12-26 03:11:48 Not true. That right there made me lose any credibility for you. Arab extremists are recruited through bitterness and resentment not at freedom, but at what they see as the west meddling in their politics and greed for oil. It was one of the main points for ISIS and the Taliban
9071 2018-12-26 03:11:48 Ooooooh!! Yeah olive oil & balsamic vinegar was one of the gifts I bought too

9087 2018-12-26 03:09:57 No one denies DDT has effects on the environment. But extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof, and you have offered none.

Much like peak oil, the ozone hole, the new ice age, and Malthusian overpopulation, Silent Spring is garbage.

9091 2018-12-26 03:09:11 Is Turkey good NATO or bad NATO? Look, I’ve no idea if Trumpy made the right move, but our previous involvements in the Mid East are disastrous except to help move more  oil. Perhaps a change to policy is necessary.

9115 2018-12-26 03:06:10 I don't think you've understood what's going on. The net tax from oil/gas in Norway is extremely high.

9122 2018-12-26 03:05:43 What is disingenuous about noting how much money he received from the oil industry? More than 20 oil executives maxed out to him. He isn't getting that money from gas station janitors.

9128 2018-12-26 03:04:40 The importance of science not being muzzled. Right @CPC_HQ 

Especially while the cons want to champion oil, gas and pipelines. 

@NDP @liberal_party @CanadianGreens 

We should be at least 20 years ahead on this. The bulk of that blame goes to the muzzle the cons put on science.

9137 2018-12-26 03:02:02 Racism is definitely a component, gun rights, abortion, SCOTUS, and his celebrity. They've seen him for years on TV and look past facts. He's a modern day snake oil salesman, a fraud, but they've bought into it.
9138 2018-12-26 03:02:01 Iraq needs to be a superpower with all its oil.  Infrastructure needed
9139 2018-12-26 03:01:53 Does anyone know if Bissel Little Green's soap will take motor oil stains out of faux fur??
9140 2018-12-26 03:01:45 You were not and still are not 100% correct. Taking money from the oil industry (say pac money) is different than getting money from employees of oil / gas companies, especially in TX where it is expected.
9141 2018-12-26 03:01:24 That’s the safest dog:  is it because pipelines aren’t flowing; carbon tax is a robbing; and NDPs are about to get kicked out; ndp hated pipelines; had anti gov. Registered anti oil lobbyists so quit pretending you really want oil to flow.  
So Out OUT OUT quickly!
9142 2018-12-26 03:01:10 They are not intrested....

Everything is now about second term 

Even when our troops were killed they did nothing...it was Boko Haram video that confirmed to many their Sons and Fathers were dead ...

Only things Buhari cares about is oil, cattle and second term
9143 2018-12-26 03:00:54 in Afghanistan, they want their natural resources and their opium. Hillary set up the coop in Libya to take their gold, they were going to make their own money and their oil. we do that in a lot of countries. now, who are the bad guys?
9144 2018-12-26 03:00:48 Ok...Is is the rep oil side effect video? I'm getting tagged like crazy and can't even see why.

9153 2018-12-26 03:00:02 I smell like Christmas. Showered with Dr. Bronner's peppermint soap,  moisturized with peppermint body butter then put peppermint oil in my locs. I'm a walking candy cane.
9154 2018-12-26 02:59:59 Goodbye @lushltd you’re an absolute piss take. Not only are your prices extortionate and arrogant for a bit of bicarb and essential oil, you don’t even do sales and honour your customers like every other retailer on the planet. Who do you think you are? Louis Vuitton? Disgusting.
9155 2018-12-26 02:59:52 Just took my echinacea and elderberry, and am currently doing my skin care routine while my essential oil diffuser gets my room smelling good before l lay down. 

Is this wealth?! Am l wealthy?!
9156 2018-12-26 02:59:41 i got an oil diffuser for christmas and also found out im allergic to synthetic peppermint oil and not the real stuff so HELL FUCKEN YES

Salamat.
9160 2018-12-26 02:58:50 ok, please tell me who has threatened us? we have nukes. we will not have to go over there. we are the bully of the earth because of that.  no country that i know of wants a war with us.  they lied about nukes in iraq. all they wanted was their oil.
9161 2018-12-26 02:58:41 Might be a side-effect of the beard oil.
9162 2018-12-26 02:58:39 As the country getting its revenue from oil amply, its leaders just starting using that monety,despite being invest that money in other sectors(agricultural, Industrial sector).
Now as we see oil prices lowering down,and Venezuelan people dragged to destitute.
9163 2018-12-26 02:58:33 To get from there to squealing about how it is just remarkable that O'Rourke has raised more oil industry money -- eschewing the distinction between individual donors and PAC money -- you have to be willfully obtuse or dishonest. He raised more money from every goddamn sector.
9164 2018-12-26 02:57:56 Paiq tengah apply oil & gas kot ehh
9165 2018-12-26 02:57:36 Castor oil overrated still
9166 2018-12-26 02:57:27 There’s no substance to his comparison. The oil thing is a complete lie.(1% from an employee of oil is not oil pac money) When I read an article & see more than one lie or disingenuous comment I know a liar wrote it & so do you. I’m not for or against Beto. I’m against LIARs.
9167 2018-12-26 02:57:02 Yes Moca are you living in a tent with an ouside campfire to keep you warm and to cook on , do not I repeat do not take a plane anywhere for goodness sake throw that horrible phone device in the fire you are burning  right now that comes from  factories overseas that use oil
9168 2018-12-26 02:56:54 Does don’t look like Tamales. Those look like Pasteles, which are Puerto Rican, delicious and often eaten with ketchup, olive oil, hot sauce or a combination 
9169 2018-12-26 02:56:38 ...And so context: 1) He raised money dramatically from individual donors in every sector across the board because he was running against a GOP icon in a big national race & 2) He gathered donor money from all professions, but actually at a smaller proportion from oil employees.
9170 2018-12-26 02:56:26 It’s baked whole fish with lemon, olive oil, salt & pepper
9171 2018-12-26 02:56:14 WE GOT A GIFT CARD TO PENZEYS AND HIGH QUALITY OLIVE OIL!!!!! I’m so excited
9172 2018-12-26 02:56:10 Humans have added just 5cm in 80 years to sea level so no one can possibly notice. And “Big Oil” is simply providing a legal product that people want. The consumers (everyone) are the ones to “blame”.  Really stupid issue

9174 2018-12-26 02:55:44 Though technically missing the point of the latke, which is to eat something fried in oil. (But, yes.. ghee would actually make them taste better)
9175 2018-12-26 02:55:29 In another world we have absolute geniuses like nutsy PELOSI, chuck the snake oil salesman, maxine "low IQ"watters, mr. 2% economic growth every year "obuma", crooked hillary, dems sure have an outstanding cast of characters, a fine bunch of MISCREANTS
9176 2018-12-26 02:55:22 Try CBd oil with a touch of THC for what ails you. Also, try natural coconut oil, lemon juice or organic apple cider vinergar with the “mother” before trying conventional pharmaceuticals... you’ll be amazed.
9177 2018-12-26 02:55:21 We made them tonight too! Grapeseed oil is key.
9178 2018-12-26 02:55:11 Oil price has since c2004 been opaquely supported via the Brent complex #BigLong What happens in Q1 2019 once these positions have been finally unwound is not clear. Quite possibly the WTI strip will simply be bought & if so Brent/WTI will compress
9179 2018-12-26 02:55:02 I JUST saw this!! Thank you Delaney hope ya had a very merry Christmas, beautiful!!

-Hope you know that Venezuela is country which is wholly dependent on oil exports(95%).Their PM don't even realise the need of develop other sectors.

9188 2018-12-26 02:53:54 Pure intelligence at work. How he manipulated SA, Iran and Russia into overproduction of oil to lower its price is beautiful. Or how he made E. Warren to publish her DNA results and practically eliminate herself as candidate for 2020.

9191 2018-12-26 02:53:39 spent my christmas money on cbd oil to vape. seems appropriate.
9192 2018-12-26 02:53:24 ...with a third of a million such workers and nonetheless took no PAC money from oil and trailed Cruz, who was No. 1. Meanwhile -- here's the context -- O'Rourke is also No. 1 in donations nationally FROM 40 INDIVIDUAL DONORS IN 40 OTHER INDUSTRIES...
9193 2018-12-26 02:53:12 Number one cause of climate change is cycles of the sun. #2 volcanoes. #3 cattle. #4 forest fires. #5 oil well fires. #6 ocean warming from volcanoes
9194 2018-12-26 02:53:11 The reason why the fuel (HFO, heavy fuel oil) is so polluting is because it is basically unrefined, nothing like diesel we buy.

9208 2018-12-26 02:51:40 Agreed @HayekAndKeynes. Any idea for cost curve of oil? I suspect were below 50% of global production here?

9210 2018-12-26 02:51:25 The refineries in Quebec get their oil from Canada, US, Algeria, Nigeria, and Kazakhstan mostly.
9211 2018-12-26 02:51:02 Sniff an alcohol wipe or peppermint oil.
9212 2018-12-26 02:50:56 I'm a native Texan and my father spent over 30 years of his life working for Halliburton.  I don't think there's a politician in Texas who can claim no money from the oil industry.  Beto may not be perfect, but I was thrilled to vote for him anyway.
9213 2018-12-26 02:50:54 Farmers? Why would they care, ditch weed came from crops that were originally farmed anyhow? Bigger players like the energy industry's fear of clean burning hemp oil, or big pharma's fear of less addictive pain killers atr more on target. Maybe cotton farmers had a problem.
9214 2018-12-26 02:50:41 Windmills need grease in order to rotate. So what are you going to use? Animal fat or whale oil.

9221 2018-12-26 02:49:39 @StaceyJan05  Pulse Sugar slightly to crack granules.  Then mix with the oil. You can use a thin slice of banana to glob it on. Cut slice into quarters or 6 pieces. You can also put in capsules. Use emptied Wheat Germ capsules. Have them swallow 2. Blood sugar will go up 300+

9236 2018-12-26 02:47:42 Also the conspiracy as executed was quite odd: Let’s have Sirota tweet out a screenshot of oil contributions that mostly just sits there on twitter. Then 2 days later we’ll have @neeratanden RT it and launch it. Pulling that off was indeed impressive.
9237 2018-12-26 02:47:37 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.
9238 2018-12-26 02:47:23 Just gonna throw this out there - if you store pots and pans full of old oil or whatever else IN YOUR OVEN, you are a safety hazard. I don't care why you do it, man. That is never ok.

9243 2018-12-26 02:46:26 Because he wants it to look like Beto is full of shit and is really in the pocket of Big Oil while ignoring the influence of oil across the enitire state where Beto was a candidate as well as downplaying the amount of oil money Ted Cruz took?
9244 2018-12-26 02:46:24 And instead of endless wars over oil, how about a #GreenMarshallPlan
9245 2018-12-26 02:46:07 I was just given CBD Oil so we'll see how this works.
9246 2018-12-26 02:45:40 Even if Keystone pipeline to USA and Trans Canada to tidewater were up and running we'd still have to cut back. Right now the price of oil is low. And more would mean getting less under current world market conditions.
9247 2018-12-26 02:45:26 Let turkey have Syria. Who cares? We have all the oil we need now, we are the largest producer in the world. Who wants to be in that hellhole of the Earth over there in the Middle East anyway.
9248 2018-12-26 02:45:26 Most people are unaware of the 2 Islands that are rich with oil between Africa & The ME. The President of Egypt gave one of them to the Saudi Royal Family just after the Glowing Orb moment & Trumps dance just after he was sworn in as President.I believe Trumps decision to pull
9249 2018-12-26 02:45:25 I'm with Mark ! Assad has murdered 1,000,000s of Syrians , if Syria keeps the oil , the money will be used by our enemies not for the people who live on the lands.

9261 2018-12-26 02:44:21 @StaceyJan05  To filter it out, use regular sugar,  about 1/4 cup and mix with about 1/3 c tincture of Extract Oil.  From a health food store or section.  You can use Pure Vanilla Extract if you can't get the Tincture. Then use 3/4 bottle. Pulse sugar in processor slightly.
9262 2018-12-26 02:44:14 Putin and MBS publicly might be best buddies, but economically not so. Putin needs the OPEC to raise oil prices very high so that Russian oil production can make a profit. OPEC won’t do that because US oil production almost matches OPEC’s
9263 2018-12-26 02:43:46 幸子ばばぁも叫ばれたいって言う嫉妬てし
9264 2018-12-26 02:43:41 That’s not a plan that’s wishful thinking... like pixies at the bottom of the garden ... renewables have caused power prices to explode and drive prices way up but good old Bill the snake oil salesmen is telling us this didn’t happen and never will ... he is dopy delusional hack!
9265 2018-12-26 02:43:13 lol love your work, but antibiotics won’t help me. I wouldn’t mind trying some cannabis oil or something like that but have no idea where to get legit stuff, stuff online looks watered down and doesn’t have effective doses.
9266 2018-12-26 02:43:08 how many countries have wanted to attack us since WW2? nobody. that is crap they tell us so that they can make more and more money off of weapons. most people want to live peacefully. we are in the middle east right now for saudi arabia. we attacked iraq for oil.
9267 2018-12-26 02:43:07 He discovered that a lot of individual people are employed in the oil & gas industry. Congratufuckinglations.
9268 2018-12-26 02:42:59 I put coconut oil, Cantu leave in conditioner hot six oil and water and mix it together 
9269 2018-12-26 02:42:23 Nah mad geeked that my hair is getting even more thick. All thanks to protective styling, wild growth oil and genetics.
9270 2018-12-26 02:42:15 IM SO EXCITED 
9271 2018-12-26 02:42:13 Take heed and stop tagging me on useless posts, I don't indulge in these shit.
To be forewarned is to be fore harmed
9272 2018-12-26 02:42:12 I got a weighted comforter and essential oil diffuser today—my anxiety is shaking in its boots!
9273 2018-12-26 02:42:05 Buy oil at 40 (wti) , oil stocks, if the US does attack Iran you'll be millionaire. lol
9274 2018-12-26 02:42:03 Game and Watch:

- If G&W absorbs something, he not only puts the bucket away quicker, but he is completely intangible for the remainder of the move.  He can shield on the next frame. G&W can angle chef forwards or backwards .Oil panic reflects physical projectiles.

9277 2018-12-26 02:40:49  RT @FocusOn_AD: Oil change! Shit like a NASCAR pit stop
9278 2018-12-26 02:40:48 Steak, lobster pesto and lobster ravioli. And truffle oil.
9279 2018-12-26 02:40:35 เหมือนกันแหละพี่ ตามคนนึงมาแต่คนที่ตามกลับไม่ใช่เมนเรา 555
9280 2018-12-26 02:40:33 "Beto takes oil money" ignores the fact that the "oil money" was donated by oil company employees who supported his campaign, not PAC money or anything like that. It's also oblivious to the realities of Texas politics. Alarmingly oversimplified.

9286 2018-12-26 02:39:46 exactly. even the so called independents frame the news with some sort of pro-corporate pro-oil pro-GOP horseshit.

Oil prices "rebounding" is terrible for American working people who aren't having their interests looked after by subsidies for clean energy instead of bloody oil.
9287 2018-12-26 02:39:33 Wanna know what’s weird? My 84 yr old mom tried to give me CBD oil. Ain’t shittin’ ya. 
9288 2018-12-26 02:39:31 Well, Brent Oil is at $50.5/barrel.
(down from October 3rd 2018 high of $86.74/barrel).
If oil is under $60 till 2019 General elections it would help Modi ji a lot.

9293 2018-12-26 02:38:26 FWIW: Oil tried the original orange jersey in the AHL with OKC prior to promoting it to the NHL. Wouldn’t shock me if they were test driving things again.

9295 2018-12-26 02:38:24 Me han salido unas estrías que medio van desapareciendo con ese producto que se llama Bio Oil. 
Bueno oiga.
9296 2018-12-26 02:38:13 You know how mad I’d be if a bih called me “oil spoil”
9297 2018-12-26 02:38:11 Essential oil diffusers are the best!!! I love mine 
9298 2018-12-26 02:38:09 It vets even better! The word “Christ” comes from the egyptian term “Krst”, which refered to a process of annointing mummies or pharaos with oil. Kinda like a way to mark “the chosen one”, a term also used to describe Horus!
9299 2018-12-26 02:38:09 I put peppermint oil instead of argon oil in my hair and now my scalp is burning send tweet

9301 2018-12-26 02:37:40 EPIPHANY:

On canvas/panels that are oil paint only, I can use white or a light color alkyd to outline a base line drawing layer, wait for it to dry, and THEN paint over it. O_O

9303 2018-12-26 02:37:26 I asked my girl when the last time she got an oil change was and she asked me what an oil change was
9304 2018-12-26 02:37:19 Luko ko ‘yung pinsan ko may tubig pa ‘yung Meatloaf sinalang na, kaya ang ending tumalansik ang Olive oil.
9305 2018-12-26 02:36:59 How do you take CBD oil? Do you drink it or use a vape device of some kind?
9306 2018-12-26 02:36:55 Cooking w sesame oil a different type of fuego
9307 2018-12-26 02:36:50 Does this include the kind you add eggs, water, and butter or oil? My family loves my cookies!
9308 2018-12-26 02:36:41 This is incorrect and Beto has been ON RECORD saying oil is good. Beto voted to open offshore oil exploration. Ive seen you elsewhere spreading falsehoods about Beto's record. What are you getting out of spending your free time as a Beto troll when you could be saving the planet?
9309 2018-12-26 02:36:33 Okay I’ll take your word for it, while I do my homework. BUT do they refine 100% Canadian crude? Why do we have foreign oil sailing up the St. Lawrence, or into any Canadian port, ever at all? #keepcanadaworking
9310 2018-12-26 02:36:18 I think Jamie would adapt very well, because he is an educated man, and he has Claire to help him modernize. If he was a modern man, I think he would’ve been a very good businessman, like an oil tycoon, but with morals.
9311 2018-12-26 02:36:12 And continue the slater in Yemen and killing journalists... Trump oil and Towers safe again from democracy. Start another charity slime ball

9315 2018-12-26 02:35:45 Between the 3 largest nuclear powers, Russia and US have the widest array of unconventional.none nuclear weapons. U speak in cliches, EMP tactics were tested by China and Russia in the S. China Sea and Black Sea against US Navy vessels and oil tankers. Yes, we know this
9316 2018-12-26 02:35:43 y’all got airpods but u 2,400 miles past due for a oil change merry christmas tho

9318 2018-12-26 02:35:01 That would be amazing. Not for our oil industry tho.

9320 2018-12-26 02:34:40 Olive oil and milk. I roll it thin enough to see my hand through and then brush with egg yolk.
9321 2018-12-26 02:34:36 HAHAHA I mean I sit in here and rip my oil and wax pens all day long but sadly I can’t actually smoke in here 
9322 2018-12-26 02:34:14 The employee “oil” money was about 1% of his fundraising. It’s being lied about,research it.
9323 2018-12-26 02:33:32 Stratfor is so wrong about the economic position of Russia that it has ZERO credibility on any of this. Stratfor thinks that Russia is outside the top 10 when it's almost in the top 5. 5th most billionaires. 6th biggest oil consumer. 5th biggest FX reserve holder. 6th GDP PPP
9324 2018-12-26 02:33:31 I ATE ALL THE CHILI OIL! _:(´ཀ`」 ∠):_
9325 2018-12-26 02:33:19 Yeah that doesn’t sound good. Maybe try cbd oil?
9326 2018-12-26 02:33:05 So did Bernie. Look it up. They both took $ from employees of oil not the companies. Don’t let yourself be lied to.
9327 2018-12-26 02:32:58 Don't count on progressives voting for that Repub with a D before his name. If you take Corp $$ and u don't support Medicare 4 All, student debt relief, free state colllege tuition etc..you're not a progressive and wont get my vote. No oil humpers will get prog votes.
9328 2018-12-26 02:32:52 Oil products are a useful & consumable form of energy: gold is minimally useful & is immutable. Flows of energy & gold are chalk & cheese. Gold has an energy cost: energy does not have a gold cost. The gold tail cannot wag the oil dog
9329 2018-12-26 02:32:40 No one expected Venezuela to be what it is today but the reality dawns on them today. Logically, pple who couldn't manage high oil prices would have failed woefully under what we had in 2015/2016 in terms of oil price.

9334 2018-12-26 02:32:08 Missing the point Dan, I asked about big oil and it's impact on native lands not Suzuki and co.
9335 2018-12-26 02:31:53 ooof I love that oil slick rainbow one 
9336 2018-12-26 02:31:48 I had just noticed that. Thats antenna tv for ya tho. Its not a product infomercial unless you got your certificate of authenticity for your snake oil or gold plated nonmonetary coins
9337 2018-12-26 02:31:20 Its not a good thing for anybody cuz it includes pensioners and retirees, and affects their nest eggs. (Fucking Trump rocked the apple cart, or is it the banks, or low cost of oil?)
9338 2018-12-26 02:30:54 Omg ty def something I'll try out. I'm using argan oil atm and that's been pretty good so when im done I'll pick it out
9339 2018-12-26 02:30:54 ずよよ
9340 2018-12-26 02:30:48 Just because something is big business doesn’t mean they’re always working against your interests. For instance, big oil is the largest investors in renewables and lobby’s for carbon offsets (mainly because it’s a wealth transfer, but still).
9341 2018-12-26 02:30:45 The market decay is due to a loss of confidence, market manipulation, trade wars, fed hikes, Worldwide slowing, housing/car sales, oil, and soon to be job loss. 

Trump and his people made it worse by lying about the economy, & getting banks+ plunge protection team involved

9346 2018-12-26 02:29:35 Did I burn the green beans? Yes. Was the presentation terrible? Also yes. Did I put too much oil and salt on everything? Hell yes. Did all that salt and fat make up for all the mistakes? MORE THAN. I need to cook more.
9347 2018-12-26 02:29:30 You're not doing anything to help. The price went down.  Stop blaming PMJT. The same amount of oil is flowing all across North America 24/7 as it did when Harper was PM. The energy sector made 13.5 billion profits while they laid off 20,000 workers. Geez! Wake the fudge up.
9348 2018-12-26 02:29:05 If you eat pussy with coconut oil on it, and you are allergic to coconuts, you are not allergic to the Pussy, LoL. ALTHOUGH YOUR LIPPS WILL BLOW UP, YOU ARE NOT ALLERGIC TO THE PUSSY

9352 2018-12-26 02:28:19 I could get an easy A in English and completely bomb science, and it wasn’t because I couldn’t grasp the concepts, but because my brain slid off every attempt to study like it was an oil slick

9355 2018-12-26 02:28:01 we actually have reason to believe what we believe. You just hate trump. November elections? Mattis? Bear market? Is that the best you guys have 
A few words. Haiti,arming rebels/alqrudda(wikileaks), biggest oil producer
Dollar is strong feds raise interest people sell stocks
9356 2018-12-26 02:27:53 I love coconut oil until I go to pick up my phone and the screen smudged to shit from my oily ass thumbs
9357 2018-12-26 02:27:45 Analyzing votes, advocacies, financial backing and statements to assess the veracity of the claim that Beto is some sort of proto-progressive, and determining that his votes dovetail neatly with his debt in oil money isn’t an attack. It’s an observation.
9358 2018-12-26 02:27:16 パエージャ！！
9359 2018-12-26 02:26:48 It's not that he doesn't believe. It's just that he doesn't care as his oil drilling is part of the problem and does not want helping our world pollution getting rid of his wealth

Better than Cruz is my point, and yours.

I am criticizing Sirota for campaigning against the impure Dem in the general.

Like Hillary.
9369 2018-12-26 02:24:18 my family is gambling rn and my mom lost and my uncle goes “there’s some of that oil & gas money” and my mom goes “ya were pretty used to giving that away” hahaha holy fuck 
9370 2018-12-26 02:24:16 Does this imply at $42, Fed will be motivated to add USD liquidity to drive oil higher?

9382 2018-12-26 02:22:32 Beto did not take big oil $. Texas is an oil/gas state. Many people work in those companies as geologists, advertising, mgmt, mail clerks etc...like any corporation. Individuals who donated were asked about their employment. Working at Shell Oil as a mail clerk doesn’t = Big Oil.

9400 2018-12-26 02:19:07 The problem isn't Ottawa. Right now oil is flowing all over North America24/7, like it always has.  It never stopped. The price dropped.  Not the fault of PMJT.  When you look at the rest of the world, we should be counting our blessing. Not be greedy .
9401 2018-12-26 02:19:06 今日は何オイルがいいかい?アロマオイルで香りたい?オリーブオイルでイタリアンたい?ふふふ…僕は君のためならどんなオイルにもなってやるさ…

9406 2018-12-26 02:18:14 Center For American Progress IS NOT PROGRESSIVE. They're a think-tank run by Hillary's former campaign manager, funded by gas and oil money as well as the UAE. They're effectively lobbyists and propagandists against the public's interests.
9407 2018-12-26 02:18:10 Review Beto’s voting record. He was complicit with others in the House supporting and voting with Trump on several occasions. Further he is second only to Ted Cruz in the amount of money he gets from big oil and gas. I will vote for the Dem nominee regardless but Beto has issues.

9410 2018-12-26 02:17:34 Oil prices were mixed in thin trading on Wednesday as the U.S. benchmark rebounded from steep losses in the previous session, even though concern over the health of the global economy continued to overshadow the market in the longer term.

9412 2018-12-26 02:17:16 @RideCannondale 27.5 M Trail AGR purchased for my son on Nov 9th, 18 at @Zweirad_Stadler. Due to defect (oil in brake cylinder) carried back to them on Dec 8th, 18. Child until today without bicycle. Low quality of product. Zero quality of service. No recommendation.
9413 2018-12-26 02:17:02 I was just talking about the marijuana hemp oil & she’s talking about it going under the tongue now & not making you high... I’m straightedge . Enough of this bullshit.
9414 2018-12-26 02:16:44 Cheat codes of life:

1. Buy a pull-up bar and put in your reps on a daily basis to failure. 

2. Use a full spectrum CBD oil. 

3. Drink a soothing bed-time tea an hour before you go to sleep. 

4. Eat a diverse number of mushrooms (chaga, psilocybin, lionsmane, reishi, etc).

9426 2018-12-26 02:15:07 Highly recommend the new movie Vice. Shreds a giant light on the time America sold out to oil execs to start a war based on lies. Also, it’s witty and fantastically made.
9427 2018-12-26 02:14:54 I have a bag of weed, oil, warm blankets
9428 2018-12-26 02:14:53 Left coconut oil in my hair for like 3 hours, we’ll see how my hair feels  when I wash it off

9431 2018-12-26 02:14:37 Yes! Romega herring caviar oil from Arctic nutrition. It’s an omega 3 supplement, but it worked so well against psoriasis that Haukeland university hospital in Norway is performing clinical trials to prove it’s efficacy as a psoriasis drug (psorax35). You’re welcome
9432 2018-12-26 02:14:31 ขอบคุณมากๆค่าาา

9443 2018-12-26 02:12:35 I love the essential oil candles!!
9444 2018-12-26 02:12:33 Neither you nor Ocasio-Cortez know what the 3 branches of Government are, stocks aren't tanking, they're on sale, business is booming thanks to Trump, gasoline prices are low, oil is half of what it was under Obama, and the Corrupt Clintons are under investigation for a solid yr.
9445 2018-12-26 02:12:23 You don’t know much about over the road foreign crews. Might want to check the next time a crew of Somali’s stops to get an oil change.
9446 2018-12-26 02:12:19 It’s a weird choice 

The lyrics are vague enough and it’s such a beautiful song I guess you can get away with it if you both really want that to be the song

And if you get divorced you can loop it and drink heavily the way most people enjoy that song

9448 2018-12-26 02:12:08 I buy her supplies from a company called Cibaria out of CA. They say their palm oil is sustainable.
9449 2018-12-26 02:12:03 they're not gonna need an oil change for 6000 miles after this one
9450 2018-12-26 02:11:41 This is not even the point.  EVs can run on numerous sources of energy.  Solar, fossil fuels, or nuclear.  With ICE cars, they can only run on one thing - GAS!  Mining lithium doesn't even compare to what oil did to the environment for over 100 years.
9451 2018-12-26 02:11:29 Akala mo talaga glossy pagmumukha mo, oil yan te oil!
9452 2018-12-26 02:11:28 It was a long oil / short nat gas trade that worked out well for a while until being massively short gamma buried them
9453 2018-12-26 02:11:16 Oh wait, ErDOGan says he'll take care of ISIS. What treason weasel tRUmp isn't telling us is that ISIS has been selling oil and antiquities to turkey all along and erDOGan's been making money, hand over fist off of them

Ya, he'll 'take care' of them
9454 2018-12-26 02:11:13 i spilled cinnamon essential oil all over my hands now i smell like christmas
9455 2018-12-26 02:10:23 a record player, some oil paints, new watercolours, a massage voucher and some perfume :)

9458 2018-12-26 02:09:57 did beto use his oil money to buy a horde of internet trolls or what? this is getting ridiculous
9459 2018-12-26 02:09:50 Gun Oil is the best tho fr fr and if you have frizzy, coarse hair you can use a smidge of it as a smoothing serums, works like a charm. Signed, A Big Hoe

9462 2018-12-26 02:09:08 Speaking of Bernie, the occasional Dem when it's to his benefit, what's he done these past two years? Same as he did for his first 40 years in DC; nothing. Except these days he does match Trump rally for rally telling all how wonderful he'd make America. Snake oil salesmen both!

9466 2018-12-26 02:07:43 like, the alien smoking man supersoldier black oil - yeah, that was an interesting line of narrative, but would work better in a buck rogers kind of setting. in those days, it was super-frustrating to have missed just enough to be lost. but the stand-alone stories were fried gold
9467 2018-12-26 02:07:39 Nilagyan naman ng baby oil para di lamigin hahaahah
9468 2018-12-26 02:07:32 Yeah - slice, olive oil, facedown and as it roasts it’s an aroma thing that just makes everything richer. Then I used the mushy garlic for a garlic-butter sage sauce I put on homemade sweet potato gnocchi. #Humblebrag
9469 2018-12-26 02:07:25 <living bottle of olive oil
9470 2018-12-26 02:07:23 mentioned to my mom that i wanted to practice more self love and for christmas she got me an essential oil diffuser with a note that said “self love is hard but smelly stuff makes it easier”
9471 2018-12-26 02:07:20 This oil got me stupid high, I think I fucked up

9473 2018-12-26 02:07:06 Tonight my grandma anointed me with oil and prayed me into the ministry. I've never been more aware of the huge legacy I'm carrying. Also, I cried, like a lot.
9474 2018-12-26 02:06:59 Most of the UFCs greatest cheated. Anderson Silva, Machida, Lesnar, Overeem, Chael Sonnen, Frank Mir, All the SILVAS have been busted. Literally half the heavy weight champions. 

And if they wasn’t on roofs then they were doing like GSP and soaking in baby oil before the fight.
9475 2018-12-26 02:06:48 There are "sustainably sourced" options for Palm oil too. Palm oil isn't the devil, so much as cheap Palm oil is..
9476 2018-12-26 02:06:26 hopefully I am wrong, spectacularly wrong

but I think it's reasonable to say the era of low-hanging fruit--I'm thinking of energy mostly... abundant coal, easy oil--is gone. it was responsible for probably the greatest changes in How People Live since the dawn of agriculture
9477 2018-12-26 02:05:24 Really? Is he on our side? My private insurance went up by $2,000. Oil is tanking. Our side? That’s what I thought at first, but I’m losing hope!
9478 2018-12-26 02:05:22 they were very good! we roasted them w olive oil, sea salt, and garlic
9479 2018-12-26 02:05:21 I’d be interested to see this Vette’s next oil change.
9480 2018-12-26 02:05:10 Hi thank you for reply. This is contract basis under multinational oil and gas company in Malaysia.
9481 2018-12-26 02:05:03 ในกลุ่มมีแต่เพื่อนผช เพื่อนเลยชอบแกล้งค่ะ ฮือออออ เคยโกรธจนจะลุกไปต่อยปากทีนึง ว่าเราได้แต่อย่าว่าศิลปินเรา
9482 2018-12-26 02:05:01 Weird huh. Almost like they lied or something
9483 2018-12-26 02:04:59 I concur with you @MohamoudGaildon  if you can't help don't put oil. I see that porposely less representation were noticeable on certain regions. Let's see how soon @HIPSINSTITUTE  report would look like. It's hard to swallow and justify this approach.
9484 2018-12-26 02:04:58 My best seller is called" happy men". I sell that to a gentleman who lives in Arizona. But there is palm oil in my recipe.
9485 2018-12-26 02:04:39 It took me forever to realize that Curtis is doing a Cary Grant impression (I think) when he's pretending to be Shell Oil. [Watching it now as well]
9486 2018-12-26 02:04:35 I also got beard oil so my beard smells good, 2019 is gonna be my year
9487 2018-12-26 02:04:32 Mum brought me some cannabis oil can you believe that
9488 2018-12-26 02:04:29 I don't want to be a leader. I want to be one who goes around with a little oil can and offer help when I see a breakdown. #BabaAmte
9489 2018-12-26 02:04:03 Me getting ready for family Christmas dinner: let's cover myself in lavender oil so when I inevitably go back to bed my sheets will smell nice
9490 2018-12-26 02:04:02 Our stock market is selling off hard. We are giving Putin all the oil pipelines in Syria, the oil going to Europe. #TrumpResign We seem to have made a trade deal with Saudi. Brent 50 dollars a barrel.
9491 2018-12-26 02:03:56 Honestly, I'd probably marry McConnell. You get a nice wardrobe from all that oil PAC money and he probably doesn't talk at dinner...
9492 2018-12-26 02:03:42 PAUSE, the liquid that the olives are in or just olive oil??? Blink once if you're okay, Blink twice if you need help

9494 2018-12-26 02:03:14 Christmas on an oil rig in the gulf isn't as glamorous as you might expect. 

But the food was really good.
9495 2018-12-26 02:03:08 Please Mr. President!!! You have done nothing to help lower healthcare. We pay over $22,000 a year out of pocket! It’s killing us, you also promised to help the oil industry which is tanking! We voted for you based on many of these issues. What are you going to do to help us?
9496 2018-12-26 02:03:06 今回は売り子さんと打ち上げの予定なのでご遠慮させていただきますわー。またの機会がありましたらぜひぜひ！
9497 2018-12-26 02:02:57 What in the Sam Hill hell is going on.  I've just about had it with this nonsense.  Americans need to get their asses home.  Stop the dictator bullshit.  WE have no business in the middle east.  Ok?  You got your oil.  Now stop it.  Clean up your mess and close Libya's border.
9498 2018-12-26 02:02:34 The Lisbon Treaty says In 2022 we would become an EU state, & have to give up our currency, sovereignty, nationality. No more Queen or King. Our fishing rights owned by EU, All gas, oil, minerals, become EU property. Financial centres all moved to Strasbourg. Leave all of EU Now!
9499 2018-12-26 02:02:02 Hey Jimmy, SNF the Eagles were playing Dallas. I’d come home from working, went to make popcorn on the stove (w/oil). Eagles did something exciting - I turned & watched for a long second. Turned back...out of the pot, tossed some baking soda on it & watched from the breezeway.
9500 2018-12-26 02:01:28 I retired from the Auto industry. I was hourly and I got layed off 10 or 15 times in the 34 years. Due to oil and foreign imports. I completely understand. But we have got to take care of each other and keep the faith...
9501 2018-12-26 02:01:19 George can you please remove Tory Blair's face from your post. It's upsetting. It makes me feel very ill. If I see it at night I have trouble getting to sleep for fear of the nightmares.

9503 2018-12-26 02:01:10 i usually cook medium-high with coconut or olive oil, but people are telling me i need to add sesame oil during the cooking
9504 2018-12-26 02:00:59 Oil rallying is a positive sign for asset prices. Though, that may have more to do with Israeli strikes v. Iranian targets in Syria than fundamentals.

9513 2018-12-26 01:59:03 And you're intimately familiar with what I've seen? 
Where is there a war in South/Central America? There are hundreds of thousands in the country on TPS status more than 20 yrs after the event that brought them here. Once in, nothing temporary about it
9514 2018-12-26 01:59:03 ايه الأجانب اكتشفوا النفط.

9516 2018-12-26 01:58:30 might need to add sesame oil maybe?
9517 2018-12-26 01:58:18 Get Steven Mnuchin on the phone with the CEOs of all the major oil corporations and fix it

9519 2018-12-26 01:57:45 Sesame oil is pretty key if you’re not using it already
9520 2018-12-26 01:57:01 Ah yes, getting oil to rub on Testikles. Wonderful set up for an Odyssey mission

9523 2018-12-26 01:56:28 No, we are worried the Dems will again choose a candidate with no policies except more of what Hilary offered: pro oil, pro Israel, pro financial capital  with no concern for real working class & racial justice issues
9524 2018-12-26 01:56:10 All objections against the Communistic mode of producing, yet for about a week until the soap has absorbed the oil.
9525 2018-12-26 01:55:59 Coconut oil is Gods gift to Earth
9526 2018-12-26 01:55:42 And the us govt gives 20 billion dollars a year to gas and oil companies...that would be a great healthcare system!!
9527 2018-12-26 01:55:28 Pardon me; I wasn't aware this was the first time the oil price collapsed.
9528 2018-12-26 01:55:18 I really wish BO didn’t accept so much money from oil executives. He seems genuine but It just smacks of another democrat who’s going to tow the Wall Street BS once he takes office

9530 2018-12-26 01:54:51 Nigeria has always used conservative figures.. figures way below price expectation. often times by a margin of 20% and the diff is saved in excess crude oil account. The whole Analyst estimate is just BS. what objective matrix was used. You can't just pull numbers from ya ass.
9531 2018-12-26 01:54:50 i got a record player, oil paints, some new watercolors, a massage voucher and some perfume :)

9535 2018-12-26 01:54:10 Either beard oil or a Sonos Playbar, it’s a close call haha
9536 2018-12-26 01:53:44 Anybody wanna help a broke independent girl and do my oil change lol 
9537 2018-12-26 01:52:58 Have to buy oil tmr
9538 2018-12-26 01:52:53 Men are dramatically overrepresented in the top 20 dangerous careers.  Not only do they die but also have a shorter career.

There are few old oil field workers, but there are plenty of old nurses and teachers.
9539 2018-12-26 01:52:50 Finally got an oil diffuser and a few essential oils to try out 
9540 2018-12-26 01:52:47 Haha! That was my BFF’s intro line. She was a secretary for the Top Manager of an oil refinery! Men came in all day long. She wore a G-cup bra, yes G, before her reduction surgery to a C-cup. “Eyes Up Here” was Said, (always successful), before, “Can I Help You?”
9541 2018-12-26 01:52:44 Well our day was so mellow it was almost disappointing. Next on the agenda: work my butt off for a month. Hope to find time to play with my new oil paints! And glass fusing kit!
9542 2018-12-26 01:52:39 Beans, but not like any you’ve ever had. You cook them & then begin a process of rinsing them for days or weeks depending on your recipe. You finish them with garlic & olive oil, & some people add olives. They’re very salty, garlicky, & oily. So good!
9543 2018-12-26 01:52:36 We have 12 years to do something drastic about climate change. Electing somebody with oil industry money falling out of all of his pockets is gonna get all of us killed.
9544 2018-12-26 01:52:29 I'm dying right now. I don't know what's more hilarious: Big E getting wild with the oil or Corey Graves just have a complete meltdown or Byron saying it's all perfectly fine.
9545 2018-12-26 01:52:22 Have you tried the shampoo bars? I recommend Jason and the Argon Oil and also smells divine! Xx
9546 2018-12-26 01:52:08 「大好き」って人とは仲よくできない自信しかない・・・　＞RT
9547 2018-12-26 01:51:59 Oooooooo beautiful!! These would be fun to oil paint!
9548 2018-12-26 01:51:59 Also if you dump used cooking oil or grease down the drain.. YOUR MOMS A HOE
9549 2018-12-26 01:51:48 like they are so easy to just throw on and then after a long day you can take it off and oil your scalp it’s lovely
9550 2018-12-26 01:51:13 I would let your friend know about Rick Simpson oil immediately.
9551 2018-12-26 01:51:10 WHAT THE FUCK HOW DID I MISS THIS!!!
you’re so gorgeous it’s honestly oil painting worthy!!!! 
9552 2018-12-26 01:51:02 Big E looked like a chocolate bar melting with all that oil. #SDLive
9553 2018-12-26 01:51:00 After this long ass drive to lousiana and back my Jeep needs tires and an oil change 
9554 2018-12-26 01:50:53 Castor oil and consistency
9555 2018-12-26 01:50:51 Yep, I’ve come close a few times to my essential oil/water recycling/filler bottle. I understand the lavendery thing. Bleuch.
9556 2018-12-26 01:50:47 Now let’s push this giant ball of oil out this window.

9567 2018-12-26 01:48:07 What In The Fuck, It takes a lot of his fucking time, because this causes so much of the oil and gas from Russia.
9568 2018-12-26 01:48:00 We should stop receiving oil from Saudi Arabia, not only they're shady for their actions, but the USA is doing great with their own oil production that they're exporting more than they can ship in.
9569 2018-12-26 01:47:22 Oil ?
9570 2018-12-26 01:47:21 The WTC attack had zip to do with Israel. 
Iraq invaded Kuwait and scared the Saudis and world (Kuwait = much of world's oil reserves...)
Saudis invited US to put troops in Saudi arabia.
bin ladin said, no infidels in saudi arabia, we leave or face war with him.

9586 2018-12-26 01:44:46 When you're sitting on one of the largest oil reserves in the world you're bound to get screwed by the oil vampires
9587 2018-12-26 01:44:14 No matter what the journalists do, world still supports the criminals from Ukraine, Russia. It is because the criminals agree to work for 'crude oil democracy defenders of the world' and other greedy guys. Weak Ukraine which fully depend on import and cheap UAH is the goal. Sad.
9588 2018-12-26 01:44:05 Big Oil ok here in Australia. Poor fuel quality and high prices. Lovers of diesel 4x4. Current govt. loves coal.

9590 2018-12-26 01:43:43 I think you have no idea what the real world is like. Everything that we’ve fought for over the last 50 years is being dismantled.  You are a fake old white man who has sold ignorant and stupid Americans a bill of goods. You are a snake oil salesman.

9596 2018-12-26 01:42:42 I know I love baby oil lol
9597 2018-12-26 01:42:37 any longer.
It's a known fact that mining and burning fossil fuels is dangerously heating our planet.  
We have almost no time left to cut our oil/gas usage.  The #oilandgas, and banks are the ones pushing the government to ramp up development in the oilsands..
9598 2018-12-26 01:42:18 My 12 y/o brother got me a sleep mask, candle, and lavender essential oil for Christmas because he said sometimes I’m an angry person and maybe that will help
9599 2018-12-26 01:42:09 Big oil’s plan all along elf energy technology is the future they’re counting on to lead them to record profits.
9600 2018-12-26 01:41:52 Indian stock market in isolation should perform better but it’s not immune to global events, geo-political conditions, trade wars & above all crude oil prices. Let’s hope trade war issues are resolved sooner & normalcy is restored. Happy 2019
9601 2018-12-26 01:41:43 Yeah, but it isn't because we are allies with those fucking jackasses, just for oil, I can't wait until we move past oil and they have squandered their riches on trivial bullshit
9602 2018-12-26 01:41:41 You probably also believe Obama when he said the ocean levels would fall, and that he’s also responsible for record oil production.
9603 2018-12-26 01:41:30 Your choice of words tells me otherwise. Oil went from +1.22% to .92% and you chose to use the word "hammering down". If oil and ES are both up tonight that's good. That means no panic. Mnuchin is a whole different issue Monday. The amateurs panic while the pros overnight bought.
9604 2018-12-26 01:41:28 I don't even have a lamp oil to lose, but i've still decided that im the king!
9605 2018-12-26 01:41:16 For garlic lovers, a simple dish is to just cook a ton of garlic (not an exact measurement), and red pepper flakes in about a 1/4 cup of good olive oil. Low heat to not burn garlic. Cook spaghetti and pour the garlic-infused oil over it. Add chopped basil and optional cheese.
9606 2018-12-26 01:41:08 AWWW FRESNO! DON'T YOU DARE BE SOUR! CLAP FOR YOUR FAMOUS 5-TIME CHAMPS AND FEEL THE POWER! It's a New Day! Yes it is! New Day in Christmas costumes. Big E pouring oil around his body lol . New Day are on commentary. #WWE #SDLive

9620 2018-12-26 01:38:38 How, exactly, does cannabis oil stop mitosis in tumours but not in other non-tumourous cells?
9621 2018-12-26 01:38:34 @heel_josh why is Big E oil in his chest in front of all of these little kids find Amanda's got enough baby oil and any other kind of oil on him to grease somebody scalp
9622 2018-12-26 01:38:19 Pyro budget went to Big E’s body oil budget. 

Finally figured it out. #SDLive
9623 2018-12-26 01:38:16 Atheists don’t buy what you are selling. You are a purveyor of snake oil, becoming petulant from your inability to gain traction with your biblical trope. Agree to disagree and move on. No loss in that.
9624 2018-12-26 01:38:06 Toki was in the process of loading up a ball of amber-colored oil onto the tool when Nathan flopped onto the cushion near him. 

"Yous gonna be ok?"
He turned his head to look at Nate, his own brain clouded and words a little slurred.
9625 2018-12-26 01:38:06 Trying to explain Big E rubbing baby oil on himself to my mom with no context was hard and didn’t go well
9626 2018-12-26 01:38:00 Finn is probably somewhere yelling at E for stealing his baby oil.
9627 2018-12-26 01:37:57 We all know it, the tax rebate is basically for Tesla. Government is absorbing a part of the costs to make and sell a Tesla. That's good actually as government is insuring for a future we no longer have to fight multi trillion dollars wars to secure a very fungible oil.
9628 2018-12-26 01:37:55 Did Big E douse himself with baby oil before he came out! #SDLive
9629 2018-12-26 01:37:54 I charge at home 99% of time from my Solar PV. I use my ebike, escooter, Model 3 & subway. I experience zero lines, as I recharge once a week from my driveway. Zero need for service, zero defects, zero oil changes - just an amazing vehicle that is eating up market share!

9634 2018-12-26 01:37:45 Big E is lewdier than any Attitude Era wrestler. The grinding and baby oil rubbing.
9635 2018-12-26 01:37:44 This bitch bailey hasn’t gotten an oil change since Nam 
9636 2018-12-26 01:37:19 Family tradition is to do it at midnight the 24th, but my kids prefer to go to sleep early and do it in the morning. 

I've never heard of that water, but mineral/baby oil works too. I hate the way it feels though.
9637 2018-12-26 01:36:40 Big E hunny that's too much baby oil #SDLive
9638 2018-12-26 01:36:35 Okay why is Big E oil in his chest and I understand the red and green pancakes but why is Biggie oiling his chest in front of all these little kids that is very inappropriate
9639 2018-12-26 01:36:28 We have had enemies in the Middle East before 1948. 
They hated us (and the British) b/c we bought and developed their oil for pennies on the dollar and when they complained, we toppled their governments and replaced them with dictatorships. This was in the 1930s

9648 2018-12-26 01:35:47 Palm oil is the principle driving force for rainforest destruction in see Asia and one of the biggest reasons orangatans are nearly extinct. Lard makes an infinitly better soap base, my wife also makes soaps.

9653 2018-12-26 01:35:35 If you’re talking about CBD oil it’s all about mg’s.  Can be found for as little as $1 per 20 mg dose for quality organic CBD.  Now that it’s federally legal I would think that should be coming down too.
9654 2018-12-26 01:35:33 Psei falls 1.06% on open at 7400.81

9655 2018-12-26 01:35:18 Coconut oil isn't common here, but I've heard it really works  I use micellar water to remove makeup, my skin really likes it.

Quite a few European countries open presents in the evening on the on the 24th. We think you're all odd for waiting another 12 hours

9659 2018-12-26 01:34:29 Heard it was Babangida's wife who insisted on hitching her town to an oil producing state. Hence forcing her husband to integrate Asaba (an Igbo town) into Delta and making it capital.
9660 2018-12-26 01:34:06 @chcsg thank you, my voice is amazing. And I enjoy your prayer and the lead of the flow, fresh oil poured in other Pentecost events.

9668 2018-12-26 01:33:17 I just think that, since we use explosions, and magnetic readings to map ore bodies, oil & gas fields now. The very "seismic noise" that a volcano makes should be able to be used to render a topographical model of the volcano and surrounding landforms with existing technologies

9674 2018-12-26 01:32:09 I highly recommend doing a tour of the oil sands. What they are leaving behind and cleaning up is amazing.
9675 2018-12-26 01:32:06 Why do you like non palm oil soap? Is it an allergy thing, or you don’t like palm oil? I ask because my wife makes homemade soaps and uses a lot of palm oil.
9676 2018-12-26 01:32:04 I got the joke but felt excluded.    ND is red red red.   Governor, House Representative, and Senators.   But any state with oil, jobs, and a fiscal surplus is bound to be red.   Right?   Anyhow, have a wonderful Christmas everyone!
9677 2018-12-26 01:31:54 Correct.  Still, if both oil and gold are priced in CNY and USD, PBOC can control price and/or flows of oil and gold by manipulating the ratio of gold to oil, bc western gold mkt is a highly levered paper mkt.

9685 2018-12-26 01:30:17 Very grateful I got to spend Christmas with my buff husband @_villenous and my ugly doggo. We had presents, spent all day inhaling essential oil vapors, ate some tasty treats, and played with legos. It was a good day.
9686 2018-12-26 01:30:15 Like a vampire, he drinks oil out of robots.
9687 2018-12-26 01:30:04 You said more or less the same on Monday morning and then the thing crashed. Let's hope it manages to hold itself at least for today. The futures are now up only 0.11pct and even that will be good for a close. On oil they are again already hammering it down.

9689 2018-12-26 01:29:49 Any reconciliation will be short lived and will accomplish two things that will irrevocably deter the Kurds from achieving any form of real autonomy - Assad will gain control of the oil fields and all units in the SDF will be dissolved and reconstituted within the SAA.

9695 2018-12-26 01:28:05 Bring our troops home. Our young people do not need to witness the horrors of war for another nations gain, much less a US Corporate gain in oil/opioid access.
Save our youth, teach them, and protect their futures.
God Bless America!
9696 2018-12-26 01:27:54 I was not even aware that there was a market for oil in Moscow. Plus I thought that the Russians had their own blend of oil that trades at some discount to Brent.
9697 2018-12-26 01:27:51 I don't live day to day. The market will recover. So far the futures are up .35% and oil is up 1.22% so I'd say no crash as long as Trump stays quiet. pension funds should be buying this week. The selloff on Mon was totally uncalled for.
9698 2018-12-26 01:27:45 Menurutnya, salah satu faktor penyebab ekspor Indonesia loyo yaitu penurunan sejumlah harga komoditas andalan Indonesia spt karet & CPO (Crude Palm Oil).

9738 2018-12-26 01:20:55 I love parts of the Obama presidency, don't like others. On the whole, he's probably best president of my lifetime. But if climate change is existential threat, increasing oil production is not a good thing. Why's that "denigration?"

9753 2018-12-26 01:18:53 I think you mean CBD oil. It’s the non-euphoric version of the active in ingredients from the plant-Cannabidiol. Depending on laws, some head shops can’t discuss. I’m sure there’s an way to source it if it’s legal. If you get some, let me know if it helps.

9820 2018-12-26 01:07:27 Hahaha... Well, it's not liberal arts. Bottom line is, you're insulting a guy 10x smarter than you. I'm not the one claiming to know better than him w/ all his resources. You are. The oil painter. 
9821 2018-12-26 01:07:24 This is still misleading.  The current pipe is not being replaced.   The #TMX will near triple the capacity... and the history of spills with this pipe, and most all other pipelines shows that Oil will spill... 

She is just trying to make everyone feel safe with this pipeline...

9823 2018-12-26 01:06:37 Calm down... he's not taking a country to war for financial gain due to the ever increasing value of oil
9824 2018-12-26 01:06:19 Inflation / attacking $DXY and pushing oil up... that’s how the PPT is going to try and stop a stock market rout in a slowing economy... #stagflation here we come $ES_F $SPX $SPY
9825 2018-12-26 01:06:13 Beans sat on my oil pen that was in my coat at my grandparents Christmas & DANG was it smellin LOUT in that conservative living room today.

9827 2018-12-26 01:06:10 Oh yeah. 17.4 mil zinmerframes vs the youth. Not enough cod liver oil in the world to limber those old fogies up for the outright beating they’d take if they “rose up”.  Old vs young your getting pounded. Don’t threaten “action” without expectation of equal & opposite reaction...
9828 2018-12-26 01:06:09 Damn I really got oil/grease on my new jacket after wearing it one time feels bad
9829 2018-12-26 01:06:08 For Christmas, my brother changed my oil.
Didn't realize how awesome and convenient of a present that is.
9830 2018-12-26 01:06:01 It's disappointing how some use their positions to spill their stands/attacks on an issue or someone to their advantage. Nice try on mixin' some used oil on clean water. 
9831 2018-12-26 01:06:01 One good thing about life, is that you dont need to be a pimp to pimp smack. All it takes is some baby powder or baby oil and SMACK!!!!
9832 2018-12-26 01:05:50 No oil, for chicken breading I’ll spray a little Pam if when it’s almost done and there is some flour showing
9833 2018-12-26 01:05:47 @Imp_Storm Zinc, Omega 3 Fish Oil, Magnesium, Probiotics, and Ubiquinol. All you need.
9834 2018-12-26 01:05:46 These are not from “the oil & gas” industry.  It’s from people who work in the oil & gas industry.  Beto took no PAC money.
9835 2018-12-26 01:05:21 @JamesSchiro1 You are welcome to come to #103 for wonderful warm pasta with fresh basil, tomatoes and EV olive oil, cheese & crackers,  & just enough wine to help heal you!!! Love, your wife Renee

9838 2018-12-26 01:04:42 You’re as fake as a $3 dollar bill. One day people will wake up to the realization that we don’t need a book and a snake oil salesman to tell us to be good to others, while you rob us from rights which all Americans deserve. Please go ingest a buttplug and stop lying.
9839 2018-12-26 01:04:40 But not the oil sands.
9840 2018-12-26 01:04:30 Bitch, I can’t even afford to change my oil rn 
9841 2018-12-26 01:04:26 Olux-E foam or CBD oil 
9842 2018-12-26 01:04:17 Keep an eye out to Venezuela
 Russia making deals oil fields for cash.
9843 2018-12-26 01:04:14 So just keep in mind that different skin types react differently. Not sure if you are getting the raging case of acne like I did, and even then, that differin stuff, I can only use every other day.  Otherwise, I produce too much oil and that causes a horrible breakout.
9844 2018-12-26 01:04:08 It takes a pretty big crew to film a national TV ad, especially at outdoor locations. This leads me to believe the folks who make Dawn dish soap have caught little ducklings & sea birds, & covered them in crude oil just to wash them off for the cameras & let them go again.
9845 2018-12-26 01:03:50 Iya bukan. Biasanya klu first, yg bahannya lbh gentle. Kek oil ato milk.

9861 2018-12-26 01:02:03 Beto is about the most hollow candidate the DNC could muster. But as long as he keeps taking oil money and voting with the GOP, quite frankly I'm not surprised he's your guy. What irks us about him isn't that he's like Senator Sanders. Christ at least Bernie votes with democrats.
9862 2018-12-26 01:02:02 You know what the wall will do? Keep his herd of mindless drones following him chanting MAGA and thinking everything’s great. It’s a tasty pie in the sky. Bon apeitit on that snake oil.
9863 2018-12-26 01:01:56 What’s the deal with oil running out? We just have to compress and heat more organic matter.
9864 2018-12-26 01:01:52 If you look at a $1 bill closely, you’ll see it’s covered in reptiles! Punk rock was invented by an ad agency to sell spikey pins! Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!
9865 2018-12-26 01:01:46 I have the Sajé pain release roll-on and it does relieve my myalgia a bit. I also find frankincense oil in a diffuser helps alleviate it. I remember reading that the frankincense is specifically used for neurological pain, which is common in #mecfs . It is expensive though!

Ok...did he still vote in that industry’s interests? So...shut up?
9872 2018-12-26 01:00:58 Supported M4A during race. Corporate oil? We talking 29 executives in a state of 30 million or people who work for oil companies? Voted ‘with’ GOP same % as Sen Brown. Is he progressive?

9879 2018-12-26 00:59:36 I think using plants in their natural form (the way God made it) is not wrong at all. However, people pollute the plants to make you feel certain things & certain ways. If you use them SPECIFICALLY for medical use, it is okay. But just the CBD oil. Not the THC
9880 2018-12-26 00:59:35 Extra virgin olive oil.
9881 2018-12-26 00:59:14 Also, LAPD IS GOING TO HAVE THE LARGEST FLEET OF ELECTRIC ANF FUEL CELL VEHICLES SOON. That’s revolutionary. But I have to say I’m a petroleana type of person. I like the oil business a lot.
9882 2018-12-26 00:59:14 OK, but those people have to earn a living. The oil companies are looking at other energy sources as well: algae, solar, electric truck and car fleets, and nuclear power. I think nuclear power would be really good cause it doesn’t emit any pollution into the air. Its complex!

9903 2018-12-26 00:54:26 It's my understanding that the individual contributions were from oil executives, which went against the pledge that O'Rourke signed.

9917 2018-12-26 00:51:28 No, I don't think it's OK for Bernie to take NRA money; but it's a minor crime to accepting money from Oil companies (especially if, like Beto, you take the second largest amount.)

Whoever sold WTI at 42.36 yesterday shall have a hard time to unload the bag. WTI may surge to 45+ at the end of the day. Expect a short squeeze to take place once WTI crosses over 44.

9950 2018-12-26 00:46:13 yes it does. BUT the ROI on these other products far outweighs that of petrol. I see why Indonesia/Malaysia are doing big in Palm Oil - and also crude oil. they do 25times what we do in palm oil - each. palm oil will employ a lot more people and is INDIGENOUS not expatriate based
9951 2018-12-26 00:45:54 MY UNCLE MOVED MY LAVENDER OIL IDK WHERE TO AND HE’S FAST ASLEEP I CANT EVEN ASK THE BASTARD OMG WHERES MY LAVENDER WHERES MY LAVENDER
9952 2018-12-26 00:45:21 Not true. Save the earth not the fossil fuel industry. Keep the oil, gas, coal in the ground. Dismantle all nuclear power plants too. Destroy the fossil fuel industry before it destroys earth.
Go Green: solar, wind, thermal, hydro, wave, and tidal power.
9953 2018-12-26 00:45:21 ye! individual lashes!! they're so gd if u cba wearing makeup properly. only thing i haven't tried yet is winged liner with them but as long as you keep them brushed and don't use oil based things near your eyes it's all gd!!
9954 2018-12-26 00:44:52 As I say elsewhere, I would prefer he had other donors at this time, particularly.  But even the most distressing mass shooting will not threaten the existence of the planet.  Oil does.
9955 2018-12-26 00:44:51 I can dig it. I love me some pierogies.
I usually fry them with some cut up chicken breast, in a little olive oil and fresh-ground black pepper.

9958 2018-12-26 00:43:16 Summer is a  aerospace engineering technician that likes Chili oil on their pineapple pizza with champagne
9959 2018-12-26 00:42:55 You ain’t as dumb as me until you see someone deep frying a turkey with hot oil and ask em if the oil they’re using is just hot beer. IT LOOKED LIKE BEER and idk maybe it would enhance the flavoring or something cause turkey gross
9960 2018-12-26 00:42:52 Get oil control face wash
9961 2018-12-26 00:42:48  I think that is where they are now ...they don't know if they're Green or Big Oil....... Keeping the UK afloat...or horribly oppressed and ripped off...... Whether They're the 45 or the <35.

The SNP mind map must look like Angry- Crayon-Kid  art these days....

9964 2018-12-26 00:41:33 Instead of this age of hit and hope, I’m actually enjoying a bloke showing some spine and digging in when it gets tough. It’s called test cricket.
9965 2018-12-26 00:41:22 You stole my lamp oil AND my rupees!
Bombs is all i have!
9966 2018-12-26 00:40:57 A big pain for crude oil lovers. Drag more than 6% on NYMEX. 

$42---$38 will act as major support
9967 2018-12-26 00:40:24 リーダータバコは体に良くないッスよー？
9968 2018-12-26 00:40:22 Most Scots would take the oil and the prosperous fishing waters and see the back of England as for NI an overwhelming majority wants to stay in the Eu
9969 2018-12-26 00:40:15 This the good oil

9973 2018-12-26 00:40:02 Oil and gas exploitation
9974 2018-12-26 00:40:02 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Pittsburgh sleeps.
9975 2018-12-26 00:40:02 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Pittsburgh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
9976 2018-12-26 00:40:02 We’re at the dinner table and my brother and I are fighting about everything from Canadian bacon to beard oil so merry Christmas to us
9977 2018-12-26 00:39:52 yea man. Tried them all today at my parents place. Have to say the one that felt the hottest was the Dawsons Sichuan ghost pepper sauce. Has olive oil in it so it just spreads EVERYWHERE in your mouth haha.
9978 2018-12-26 00:39:40 Our local head shop carries CBD oil. There's also a holistic store that carries it as well. You might want to check with those.
9979 2018-12-26 00:39:34 朝からやべーことが起きて、SNS、電話、メール、PCチャットを使いまくってなんとかしてくれる人を探す羽目になった
9980 2018-12-26 00:39:25 No, not my favourite enthusiasm (though I know of no society, socialist or otherwise, that have no defence capabilities).  But as I say, unlike oil, will not end the world.
9981 2018-12-26 00:39:19 this rick simpson oil got me feelin like santa 
9982 2018-12-26 00:39:18 everybody knows that when Orange Hairpiece abolishes a crucial regulation, a russian bot writes a song about #love
9983 2018-12-26 00:38:53 Human nature at its finest I want to be surprised but somehow that would make me feel stupid for not easily seeing how all this was the end result of the mixing bowl concept, add to much oil and its no longer brownies its garbage much like a culture will produce the same results.
9984 2018-12-26 00:38:42 I dont think the discovery of oil actually matters.
The only thing that matters for them is, that Exxon is an US company.
It helps them fuel their rethoric of "The empire wants to come and steal our oil, look over there, Exxon mobil.. the company that Chavez kicked out"
9985 2018-12-26 00:38:29 And a fake pastor works for no one, but himself, just like a trump, aka snake oil salesman or traitor
9986 2018-12-26 00:38:28 If you pour a decent base of oil, it will keep the butter from burning. That’s how your boy prepares the scallops on high heat.
9987 2018-12-26 00:38:12 The Sun radiates Energy on our Earth more than 29,000 times the Energy of our 87,000,000 barrels of crude oil we consume daily worldwide... Nothing else is close....
9988 2018-12-26 00:38:08 Taking money from some who works in oil and gas industry is different from taking it from the oil and gas industry. Especially in a state like Texas where huge portions of the population work for the oil and gas industry.
9989 2018-12-26 00:38:05 CBD oil
9990 2018-12-26 00:37:56 No, it’s conservatives & big business that expect the govt. to give them freebies: massive tax breaks that almost reduce tax obligations to zero; giveaways & subsidies to the oil & other industries; tax breaks just to move business to a city. And the middle class foots the bill.
9991 2018-12-26 00:37:56 If we exclude its largest energy source ... transport. Electricity consumption is minimal with most people only owning a few lamps, a fridge and a TV and a dirty oil self assembled vehicle.
9992 2018-12-26 00:37:51 Up next on the lewd Santa parade, he visits the lovely baking shop of @CatastrophyCane. Scottish wuffer climbing threw dat chimney with his tent marking his entrance. He was a little sweaty admittedly. 

It was already a long day. But it was good for the oil!
9993 2018-12-26 00:37:38 “I wish the Democrats would run a left-populist with sincere, well-attested antipathy toward Wall Street, oil and gas, welfare reform and war, who is willing to fight hard to win Medicare-for-all and drastically reverse our current course on climate change.”
9994 2018-12-26 00:37:36 m&s black truffle and olive oil crisps bang, absolute gamechanger
9995 2018-12-26 00:37:36 It's totally wrong for you to imply that my country doesn't use propaganda to take oil from other nations and profit from military arms sales. Both of our countries are run by corrupt people. Except ours pretends it's democratic.
9996 2018-12-26 00:37:18 You'd be better off. Shut down all fossil fuel forms of energy production. KEEP THEM IN THE GROUND.OIL, GAS, COAL. DISMANTAL ALL NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS .
GO GREENSOLAR, WIND, HYDRO, THERMAL, AND WAVE POWER. SAVE THE EARTH by killing the fossil fuel industries.
9997 2018-12-26 00:37:08 I got new sheets & coconut oil for christmas and I was genuinely fulfilled

10001 2018-12-26 00:36:47 Robert O'Rourke takes money from the fucking oil companies. We can't have that anymore if we're going to survive climate change.
10002 2018-12-26 00:36:34 ぽはや
10003 2018-12-26 00:36:31 The Arab attack is ongoing. What do you call replenishing weapons from Iran to Hizbollah? Looks like Iran don't  know what to do with Obama's money while their coffers are dwindling from lack of oil revenue.
10004 2018-12-26 00:36:25 なにその無理やり入院回避しましたみたいな通院回数は…。どえらい炎症でも起こしてしまったんですか…。点滴って痛いし怖いし退屈だし…拷問よね
10005 2018-12-26 00:36:14 i can’t take anything hormonal. I meticulously track my period, take my temperature every morning, and use apps to track. use non-THC #CBD oil every day & your skin will never break out again  it’s MAGIC. @TruthNaturals
