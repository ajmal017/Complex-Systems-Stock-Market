3 2018-10-23 23:56:30 The FOOLISHNESS from CRA is on steroids. Rail stocks & maintenance is expensive yet the FG is subsidizing services rather than seek to break even & turn in some profit for the rainy day. 

Without a decent profit they will run that service into the ground. It is their usual.
4 2018-10-23 23:56:16 Since autos and housing stocks are on the skids, and if you believe the market is a predictive device, it appears the FED should re-evaluate their next raises by looking at the data. I fear they will do exactly what they did in 2007-2008. Too high too fast.
5 2018-10-23 23:56:04 Indeed, so you have the power to zap yourself with new debt, to pay back later. I suppose if you can find a way to beat the market rate, then ok . Wouldn’t a true millionaire mean real liquidity like owning stocks, cash, etc? Otherwise all my friends in TO are millionaires!

8 2018-10-23 23:54:39 It's a mix of well researched stocks, including several dividend stocks and a few that are risky.  I try to stick with what I know, like healthcare industry, but I still diversify.  And I try to follow my conscious.
9 2018-10-23 23:54:06 A run in the bios has been coming . We've been talking about how undervalued our bios are compared to Nasdaq stocks for what seems like decades.

Once those left holding the ones that have run up realise they're not worth anything we could see some movement in better stocks.
10 2018-10-23 23:53:43 Do you recall home bubble burst in 2008 or dot company burst in 2003?
The stock market bubbles of renewable solar/industry investment funds & Tesla type EV stocks will go down as soon govt subsidy is gone & UN drama of CO2-AGW Climate goes dry when Australia Canada stop ransoms.

19 2018-10-23 23:48:55 The S&P 500 on the whole,may not yet be in correction territory,but about 353 stocks have fallen 10% or more from their 52-week highs. Of those,179 stocks have fallen by 20% or more from their highs.

Bummer...
42 2018-10-23 23:48:18 Used to believe that lottery creates false hope, considering the fact that you have a better chance of investing in stocks, taking your company public, getting elected President of the United States, becoming a movie star and dating a supermodel. #MegaMillions #Powerball
43 2018-10-23 23:48:01 you're really putting a lot of hope in your K&G mens warehouse stocks and shares

46 2018-10-23 23:46:50 sometimes I'll search stocks or whatever on Twitter and then go to one of the $efr or $khf or $ass or $penis stock things and just block everyone indiscriminately because you if you care about stocks you're a bad person
47 2018-10-23 23:45:52 Market is ok. You have to play in the afternoon if you look at every stocks like $mu $intc $msft $tsla $bidu $ba...etc they drop in the morning and reverse during rev time into close. It's a pattern
48 2018-10-23 23:45:51 I'm not buying any oil stocks and likely will refrain from Financial Institutions...
49 2018-10-23 23:45:05 how do you get into buying stocks????
50 2018-10-23 23:44:58 No, but it is the one most easily leveraged into money. Most stocks and businesses don't let you put down 5-10% and earn appreciation on the whole value of the business. Do you take us educated non-homeowners shut out of the market, for fools?
51 2018-10-23 23:44:55 Why don’t you just meet for coffee first. To say the economy has turned around is a rather unsophisticated understanding about the economy. Ask her how she interprets the slowing of housing starts, auto production and bank stocks down? Then decide
52 2018-10-23 23:43:51 I can't be agree with you more , but I'm not looking for another Amazon or Apple when I take risk to trade those stocks below even $1
53 2018-10-23 23:41:59 I am surprised folks on the stream haven't figured out Craig's rule #1. He has a basket of ~10 option premium stocks, repeats & rinses all day long. Eg: $AAPL keeps bouncing off $216, they can easily absorb the tariffs without much hit to margins, was a no brainer trade this AM.
54 2018-10-23 23:41:54 When your peers ask you how to buy certain stocks - you should be selling.

When your peers start complaining about their portfolios - you should be buying.
55 2018-10-23 23:40:03 Until they reverse course again??  The stocks should not play on short seller interest.  It should be illegal.  Too bad it’s not.
56 2018-10-23 23:39:33 Bitcoin hasn't gained during stocks' latest slide, but it has lost less. FWIW.

Price change over last 30 trading days:

Bitcoin -4.5% ($298) to $6,399
Dow 30  -4.9
S&P 500  -6.0
Nasdaq  -7.1
Russell 2000  -10.7
57 2018-10-23 23:38:34 No doubt, and you def risk being 1-3 quarters early on an entry today (or in housing, semis, EM, etc). If you're active and you watch your stocks (like just about everybody on fintwit), now is probably not the time. But if you're buy-and-hold, different story.
58 2018-10-23 23:36:54 I like that strategy and long term outlook. The only fly in the ointment is how weak the broad market/cannabis market ultimately gets. The market doesn't seem to be treating more spec canna stocks very well recently. The valley could get deeper. long term focus is key.

Ottawa is so good at screwing the middle class; just like the threatened status quo brought down crypto currencies.
63 2018-10-23 23:34:07 What site do you use to trade penny stocks?
64 2018-10-23 23:33:00 This is a fascinating listen. "He wants to ban bump stocks!!" "Well..... so do I."
65 2018-10-23 23:32:43 Uh oh, every ASX trader is now an expert on Biotech stocks. I thought we were all still reading up on offshore oil plays or is that so last month? :)

67 2018-10-23 23:32:20 Big company given funds to buy back stock, middle class pays for it and now cuts back on nonessential items due to lack of funds, stocks will then fall, and both business and middle class get screwed? Is this how a recession starts?

70 2018-10-23 23:31:00 You are #fakenews Have you checked your stocks lately ... we are headed for a recession! Tax cuts and huge military budget with no way to pay for any of it ... its a doomed plan and you know it!!
71 2018-10-23 23:30:46 Big company given funds to buy back stock, middle class pays for it and now cuts back on nonessential items due to lack of funds, stocks will then fall, and both business and middle class get screwed? Is this how a recession starts?
72 2018-10-23 23:30:36 Interesting action in the US last night.

The best hope for smaller stocks in AUS is if the US markets and the USD can work their way a lot further down without scaring the natives.

In markets it's not often that you get what you wish for
73 2018-10-23 23:30:19 Stocks like $uscr $mtw $cr $cat and $osk are all cheap, but they’re showing a major slowdown is being priced in.  Timing is always hard, but hard to argue about dollar cost averaging in right now.  My fear is the Fed overshooting.
74 2018-10-23 23:29:50 so it's almost like stocks? like knowing which to buy/sell and when? depending on what they're currently worth or going to be worth?
75 2018-10-23 23:28:58 Worry less about CNBC views on pot stocks and more towards market trends. As of late $TLRY has been following the direction $SPY almost to a T. Pray that SPY doesn’t continue its downward trajectory.
76 2018-10-23 23:28:50 I forgot to tell u. $BAC so Call Option today expired at 4pm. Sold b4 ER. And shorted stocks after ER $29. Now expired option can load it back at $26.... My God. Ton of money.woooooo. Thanks $BAC. Dam..... Me MR told me use that$$$$$$ to buy $TSLA. Wow made 15 points today.
77 2018-10-23 23:28:45 I don’t think any elected or appointed government official should own any individual stocks.  Index funds only should be the law.
78 2018-10-23 23:28:44 me: *has homework* 

also me: *checks every social media app, deletes some photos, checks the stocks, the weather tomorrow, organize apps by color, delete emails, wait there’s a health app?*
79 2018-10-23 23:28:24 BADASS!
80 2018-10-23 23:26:44 But Beto does not want to ban your guns! Beto is only against bump stocks, which makes semi-automatic guns automatic, & automatic rifles. And after Vegas, we can all agree automatic rifles have no place in our society!
81 2018-10-23 23:26:29 Big company given funds to buy back stock, middle class pays for it and now cuts back on nonessential items due to lack of funds, stocks will then fall, and both business and middle class get screwed? Is this how a recession starts?
82 2018-10-23 23:26:23 Unemployment is the lowest in history, economy is thriving, stocks are sexy...Trump doing everything right for the country. Stop hating just because ur Mexican lol
83 2018-10-23 23:25:42 Silly comment- that is like trying to time buying and selling stocks- important decisions are based on integrated long term data.  Nothing candidates would say or do in the next 2 weeks changes who they have been for the entire life-
84 2018-10-23 23:25:35 Investors are merciless when they fear corp profits have peaked for the economic cycle. Industrial stocks' declines from 52-wk highs:

USSteel $X  -44%
Harley $HOG  -33
Caterpillar $CAT  -31
Cummins $CMI  -31
DowDuPont $DWDP  -29
$MMM  -26
Deere $DE  -20

S&P 500  -6.8%

86 2018-10-23 23:25:03 First off bump stocks DO NOT change the way a semi automatic fires. 

Second off the ban on certain rifles did nothing to reduce crime or keep those rifles out of the hands of criminals.
87 2018-10-23 23:24:52 The notion of Cashin's comments were that money flowed from NY back to the midwest, which temporarily depleted the coffers of the NY big banks as they paid back the farmers for their crops.  That represented the low for that period for stocks.
88 2018-10-23 23:23:32 NONE: just diversify the bulk in stocks and bonds, prime world  currencies.
89 2018-10-23 23:22:59 Haha. It’s me not running away from $SMH stocks.
90 2018-10-23 23:22:57 Yeah so you put some money in accounts and stocks and then the money gets bigger because of "the market"
91 2018-10-23 23:22:56 I love 97.1fm the drive but you can tell its for old people because theh talk about stocks.
92 2018-10-23 23:22:08 Aussie market off to a flat start after 3 straight days of falls. #ASX 200 up just 2pts to 5846. No surprise energy stocks are slumping following a 4% tumble in oil overnight. Gains from major banks helping #ausbiz
93 2018-10-23 23:21:32 Sure they can, but it's why firms usually have a good track record in making you money. Baron funds for example, loves Tesla and loves tech stocks. Their returns for their clients are ridiculous. Their ceo is in public light and trustworthy. Citron research on the other hand...

104 2018-10-23 23:15:00 I'm not that concerned with a stock market crash...if it do happen, the blown up stocks are the one's in danger.
105 2018-10-23 23:14:56 For every move there is a countermove. Their stocks are reflecting the cracks that will eventually give rise to new platforms that will make them obsolete. If you doubt that, think of Sears, a mega giant at one time that is now all but a memory.
106 2018-10-23 23:14:51 U.S. stocks closed lower Tuesday,10/23/18: $DJIA -0.50% at 25,191.43, $SPX -0.55% at 2,740.69, $COMPQ -0.42% at 7,437.54, $RUT -0.84% at $1526.59.
107 2018-10-23 23:14:09 Uglier. It’s already pretty ugly. Amazing how sentiment turns on a dime. That’s what makes the market such a beast unless you’re willing to take  a LT view & ride out the volatility. As Buffett’s said, if you don’t like seeing your stocks go down, you shouldn’t be in the market.
108 2018-10-23 23:13:32 Stock market at Jan. 20, 2008 was at 7949. Stocks rose an average of 12.3% a year during Obama's two terms resulting in a 166.3% gain from his first day in office to his last.
109 2018-10-23 23:13:27 Big company given funds to buy back stock, middle class pays for it and now cuts back on nonessential items due to lack of funds, stocks will then fall, and both business and middle class get screwed? Is this how a recession starts?
110 2018-10-23 23:11:50 Hit up metzger. I’m sure he has some stocks.
111 2018-10-23 23:11:35 Anyone else betting gun company stocks going up and Huckasleaze getting a fat paycheck in his pocket?
112 2018-10-23 23:11:09 $PTX $DXB $PIQ $ADR are definitely quality stocks compared to the ones that have rocketed by 100-500% within a month, traders OK but not for LT investors. I prefer sustainable increase.
113 2018-10-23 23:09:29 Hope #AMD $AMD doesn't get burned like #TexasInstruments #TRN on earnings. What a crazy market. #stocks
114 2018-10-23 23:08:34 Plus remember or be aware People can dump stocks intentionally to hurt markets only a few have that much power.
115 2018-10-23 23:08:26 U.S. stocks fell overnight after worries about the earnings outlook added to recent selling pressure, The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 125.98 points to 25,191.43, the S&P 500 lost 15.19 points to 2,740.69 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 31.09 points to 7,437.54.
116 2018-10-23 23:08:22 Gaming stocks are nearing table pounding territory. $EA now trading at 18x forward. $TTWO down to 23x. 
No pos anywhere, although I've dabbled with both in the past.
117 2018-10-23 23:07:31 If you are worried about fish stocks maybe you should concentrate on the major problem - OTTERS - instead of keeping your heads firmly up your bottoms instigate a cull.
118 2018-10-23 23:07:16 Stock commentators on TV be like the moon is parallel to Venus and it’s the third Thursday of the month and I just ate Honey Nut Cheerios so stocks are up
119 2018-10-23 23:06:08 Later will post some nice setup from IBD50 list. Some of their stocks are too good, not the index 
120 2018-10-23 23:05:36 @liuchan Bankers already sold their stocks, you will hold the bag
121 2018-10-23 23:05:32 With the size of correction for most individual stocks this is either near the boundary of a normal correction or things turn much worse
122 2018-10-23 23:03:55 With all the talk about the economy coming from DJT, how come no one is talking about the fact that stocks have basically been stagnant since the beginning of the year?  In fact we are about 5% down from where we were at the end of January.  #DontBuyTheHype

 Similar US stocks nowhere near as advanced as $BOT are trading at multiples of it , which btw is where the CEO is now.

If you don't worry about fundamentals I guess the cheaper cap the better the stock.
125 2018-10-23 23:02:38 Hey can you buy Canadian medical marijuana stock ? I am looking cat buying at least one share of 2-3 companies, Because they wrnt down, But may go up. Not sure if non medical stocks are a thing yet.
126 2018-10-23 23:02:20 412.44% Profit... Women Lie Men Lie, My stocks don’t lol
127 2018-10-23 23:01:38 Yes, I am constantly asking my financial advisor for some mutual fund investing in commodities, stocks, currencies that won't go down when stocks and interest rates go down. We keep getting caught in a bear hug with these interest rate increases.

131 2018-10-23 22:53:33 I’d rather put my money in stocks or crypto then waste it on lottery tickets.
132 2018-10-23 22:52:49 I like the action in the stock of FEYE. I’m glad I bought into McDonald’s before the earnings. Reinitiated my position in CGC. Watching WBA, STZ, ADBE, CRM @CNBCFastMoney #DowJones #SP500 #trading #stocks #stockstowatch #feye #mcd #adbe
133 2018-10-23 22:48:33 However, it is the point where they stop beating good stocks with great fundamentals to death, and separate the good from the bad.
134 2018-10-23 22:48:02 I’d pay the taxes on it so I could have it all up front, put my pops up somewhere relaxed & nice with a personal account to spend from. Invest in some land, companies & stocks. Put some in savings & donate the rest.
135 2018-10-23 22:46:28 2/. There’s 2 things banks can do with reserves:  leave them in their checking account at The Fed.  Exchange them for treasury bonds and have a savings account at The Fed.  Only you can tell your bank to make a payment to buy land, stocks, etc...   and, of course, u can by a bond

139 2018-10-23 22:43:48 Stocks are falling because Larry Kudlow, BS in History, is advising the so-called and temporary President, on economics.
140 2018-10-23 22:43:30 Personally, I’m pleased. A great footballer and one who wont be heading overseas after the World Cup. Our stocks aren’t that deep.
141 2018-10-23 22:43:24 You morons were pumping pot stocks the most at their very high. Now you are warning people after the huge selloff? It is best to do the opposite of what you guys say.

Othrwse, w/ stocks we've just got no clear direction on, strictly straddles.  Yes, they cost more, & also protect more, profit either way. Caution comes 1st, hm?

151 2018-10-23 22:32:30 1 in 302,575,350 chance of winning the mega millions. You have a better chance investing in stocks... but the stock market plummeting 
152 2018-10-23 22:30:47 It would also be reassuring if the "meteorologists" could provide TRENDS such as last occurrences of major pot deadly storms in October. They do this on @CNBC with stocks, why can't wx be the same logically adding x to y?
153 2018-10-23 22:30:00 Jesus dude have any weed stocks at all? 
154 2018-10-23 22:29:09 I say bad because it’s unfair for someone to get free stocks against another player just because they used an infinite. (And no I haven’t had a problem with them because Luigi doesn’t really struggle against it) It’s just not fair and has always annoyed me
155 2018-10-23 22:29:04 hello i just saw 5 fb posts in a row saying beto was gonna “take away guns”. here are some facts:
-he supports universal background checks that would eliminate federal loopholes (like gun shows)
-he wants to ban bump stocks (used by vegas shooter)
156 2018-10-23 22:25:22 He’s not shorting TSLA but he’s back on the green stocks it seems. He’s always shorting something.
157 2018-10-23 22:24:06 The recent separate unrelated fires that have devastated the quality wine stocks of top Stellenbosch wineries are largely unprecedented in their calamity.
The entire region will be affected.
Our wishes go out to Kleine Zalze, Stellenbosch Vineyards, Ken Forrester, Spier & Advini.
158 2018-10-23 22:23:43 What will happen when FED starts buying stocks?
159 2018-10-23 22:23:10 Yes...it is 9.5% where I live in East TN.  I was talking about RoI for dividends, stocks, and bonds. You do understand I was talking about the Hall Tax I mentioned in my last response, right?
160 2018-10-23 22:22:05 Putting money in FXChoice to start trading Forex and in Robinhood to start trading stocks.

Time to diversify so that I can bounce around wherever the volatility is.
161 2018-10-23 22:21:01 The S&P 500 fell for a fourth-straight day. Financial names led the dip into the red, and marijuana stocks had one of their worst days ever.-The Morning Brew

173 2018-10-23 22:14:35 You know you're getting old when you start investing in stocks
174 2018-10-23 22:13:54 I think machine trading is driving the #stocks weird selloff, where the market moves vertically aka sideways.

Companies of value going low, companies of questionable growth going up. Just illogical.

But 50%+ is machine trading nowadays, right?
175 2018-10-23 22:13:50 Stocks have been in sharp decline for the past couple of weeks. Worse in the past five years. He’s not even able to tout stock market gains now.

179 2018-10-23 22:12:47 Let’s check and see how my stocks and investments are doing
180 2018-10-23 22:12:46 Put @JeffFlake in the stocks!
181 2018-10-23 22:12:23 Plus the time wasting and 'Head Butt', whether it landed or not, it was intended. Both incidents from the Brentford bench went unpunished despite the #FA and #EFL having evidence. It is these inconsistencies and the standard of refereeing, making the authorities laughing stocks!
182 2018-10-23 22:12:19 The most important thing is in your own country and in your area of the stock exchange market, do you have plenty of and enough new and good industries which are very competitive in the world to be able to attract global stocks-dealers and stocks-investors?
183 2018-10-23 22:12:07 I call upon Dick Fuld’s spirit. His wrath shall burn the deceit masters. 

Exposure to a mmpp with the 2 worst stocks? You dont deserve your fucking salary.  They are a farse. But you get your contrarian sticker boy!!! 

(For the millenials, Dick was Lehman CEO)
184 2018-10-23 22:11:55 and do you own casino stocks?
185 2018-10-23 22:11:37 and you own casino stocks which are also hurtful for a great many u call stupid?
186 2018-10-23 22:11:10 I'm a crypto guy but calling btc stable is just pure nonsense
No other asset has been as volatile
If the dollar was truly dying then silver or real estate or stocks would also be up and down and trading in a range from 1x-20x and then down 50%+
187 2018-10-23 22:11:00  Dow Jones down 500 points.

The stock market’s rough October continues. Global markets tumbled Tuesday with European stocks touching a two-year low. U.S. equity futures are deep in the red.

189 2018-10-23 22:10:15 $CAT  Didn't need good earnings to provide good trade opportunities in other (select) stocks today. Careful where you're putting your focus.
190 2018-10-23 22:10:11 Cutting taxes for the wealthy opposite of his campaign and lowering environmental regulations which increase profits for owners but poison us all are weird low people lifters. The stocks are booming but workers going nowhere. I've lived this trickle down lie since 1980's
191 2018-10-23 22:09:40 I.e. UST tends to be protection against uncertainty rather than risk-based insurance. We haven't hit uncertainty yet. I think a good measure is that indexes of dividend stocks are still overperforming the S&P last time I checked.
192 2018-10-23 22:08:34 $GRDO $MLHC simply the 2 greatest penny stocks under .01 in all of penny land!

193 2018-10-23 22:08:20 Imo the late-session comeback in stocks is pretty impressive considering how severe the damage looked to be earlier today.

195 2018-10-23 22:06:10 WATCH Mkt Outlook US stocks bounced back from a 500 point loss but still ended the session lower as fears about earnings growth rattled investors. Caterpillar and 3M both reported quarterly results that missed the mark.  SPI futures flat #ASX #Ausbiz #WallStreet
196 2018-10-23 22:05:06 Pensions / stocks and shares should be a long term investment not 3 mths if your investing the FTSE the 3 year chart is looking pretty sweet as the DOW even sweeter
197 2018-10-23 22:04:49 Australia don't be nervous. If you established wide, broad, good benefits-high world industries, commerce, other countries all over the world the stock-dealers will still purchase Australian enterprises stocks on Australia Stock Exchange, it doesn't matter other Stock Exchanges.

201 2018-10-23 22:01:54 Exactly. So many prescriptions need special storage or need used quickly. Will they supply stocks of painkillers? Not sure what they're going to do about radiotherapy either. So much that just can't be stockpiled by patients. It's a mess.
202 2018-10-23 22:01:17 You think the government right now isn’t out of control with fraudulent behavior? And to be frank, it wasn’t like the whole government knew. It was groups of people who did wrong things like pass ‘C’ mortgages in ‘A’ mortgage bonds and stocks.
203 2018-10-23 22:00:36 Depends on the timing. Don’t try to time the housing market. Hold off for lifestyle fine. Invest for at least 6 months in TDs. More than this put some to bonds / stocks. Get advice. Market is vol atm.

206 2018-10-23 22:00:20 Well and the money in stocks as well. But basically yes we are screwed. The deed was done in WW2 to gain access to their oil.
207 2018-10-23 21:59:57 Any sensible business will already be starting to build up stocks ahead of any post-Brexit supply line disruption. The idea that the government will be having to ship in emergency supplies of food and medicines is horseshit.
208 2018-10-23 21:59:44 Thanks Mike, but I'm a pure speculator so I don't hold the underlying stocks.
I'm selecting companies whose fundamentals are solid, but whose price is inordinately effected to the downside by headline events. I'll place calls at 3-6 months out, anticipating a natural rebound.
209 2018-10-23 21:59:31 That's the risk you take when buying in on stocks such as this. Best of luck if you buy in X!
210 2018-10-23 21:59:18 Larry kudlow is a jerk - stocks are falling world wide because of the trump & gop trade war on the world - it’s your policy not the Democrats -
211 2018-10-23 21:58:52 That will be different for each trader/investor, depending on their own strategy/plan/rules and how many stocks they like to hold/manage. For me this is about a 7% position right now.

215 2018-10-23 21:57:41 I would have a mandatory 3-day waiting period. I would ban the sale of bump stocks. I would ban the purchase  of military-style rifles such as AR-15s without a special permit. If you've got one, you can keep it, but you can't sell it.
216 2018-10-23 21:57:22 Global systemically important bank stocks now are absolutely plunging.  They are now down a whopping 27 percent from the peak, and that puts them solidly in bear market territory.
U.S. banking stocks are but they are getting close.  they are now down 17 percent from the peak

227 2018-10-23 21:54:26 A thread if u want to start learning how to trade stocks. There are many methods u can use to trade stocks, namely intraday trading, swing trading, etc.. The thing i’ve learnt soo far is just momentum trading, so i cant really explain how to do each of them..
228 2018-10-23 21:54:00 When you focus on placating the stock market as opposed to looking after the health of the underlying economy, the need to spring to action (to support stocks) will increase exponentially. Each urgent action will have less & less efficacy until the market inevitably collapses.
229 2018-10-23 21:52:35 Yes for a little while and also buy stocks in the company.
230 2018-10-23 21:50:36 Big company given funds to buy back stock, middle class pays for it and now cuts back on nonessential items due to lack of funds, stocks will then fall, and both business and middle class get screwed? Is this how a recession starts?
231 2018-10-23 21:49:38 I’ve noticed that as well. Growth stocks are down and most of the deep value plays have been fine the last month
232 2018-10-23 21:47:47 People who say ultimate should be 4 stocks have never watched a melee puff ditto. Ultimate won't be fast for EVERY matchup.

241 2018-10-23 21:42:13 Are the tech stocks going to recover from this fall? Specially nvidia Or do you see them falling even further since there's almost 100% chance of an all go trade war with China and the fed will increase rates 3 or 4 more times on 2019

3. Reinvest ALL of step 1 & 2 into music

4. Repeat until the music becomes step one. Continue forever. 

Patience.

249 2018-10-23 21:34:16 So cabinet meet to draw up plans to bring in emergency stocks of medicines  and food.
You can bet that most will come from the US at greatly inflated prices,  and some people  south of the border will be lining their pockets through the misery 
250 2018-10-23 21:34:07 USD or BRL bonds. If the latter, its so dumb. I would express a bullish view on Brazil by buying stocks....
251 2018-10-23 21:32:28 and I was against the bailout of the big banks that played games with the real estate industry, selling bunk mortgages in the form of stocks to investors and creating a huge crash that the entire world felt.
252 2018-10-23 21:31:56 We did see buying of stocks that beat EPS once they opened for trading at least.  Average beat gapped down 70 bps at the open today (along with the market) but rallied 69 bps from open to close.  Maybe a sign of a turn?
253 2018-10-23 21:31:47 They are borrowing to buy their own stocks.

Debt will have to be paid eventually.
254 2018-10-23 21:31:26 Ugh, my stocks, my soybean farm...FINE last year, down by 20% (stocks) & 50% (soybeans) now.  Not feelin' the maga.
255 2018-10-23 21:31:05 Stocks closed lower Tuesday after climbing back from an early plunge, giving the benchmark S&P 500 index its fifth-straight loss.
256 2018-10-23 21:30:43 Stocks can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.
257 2018-10-23 21:30:30 She's a bit too Jolly Hockey Stocks for me but she was very good. I do like Ruby though.
258 2018-10-23 21:30:07 What about time and stocks
259 2018-10-23 21:30:02 @elonmusk really wish you could buy Tesla stocks directly
260 2018-10-23 21:29:56 how did democrat policies increase the number of criminals?  like they created people?  and just be honest, its the @gop policies that continue to allow known terrorist to buy guns, the mentally ill, and bump stocks
261 2018-10-23 21:29:49 or to put it another way, volatile stocks (both cheap & expensive) usually remain volatile (& thus, go down more than the market in a correction), while non-volatile stocks (both cheap & expensive) usually remain non-volatile (& thus, go down less than the market in a correction)
262 2018-10-23 21:29:48 I like that you are trading cheaper stocks that have some premium. I wh check some out.  No biotechs for me tho
263 2018-10-23 21:29:20 Y las exportaciones son de bienes sobrantes de stocks, no de producción para exportar, por lo que al igual de lo que hacen con el Mercado interno con la tasa y los impuestos, esta es solo una solución de corto plazo. El fracaso de la estrategia es inminente

Them: Don't you hate when people talk over each other? I was talking with this guy and he just wouldn't let me get a word in.

Me: Yeah that-

Them: He kept talking about his stocks and I was like I don't give a fuck dude! You're really fun to talk to though.

Me: So th-
265 2018-10-23 21:28:45 Ahhh, come on Porno Willie, call it what it is, you are good at it, it's called laundering money, is it not?  I suppose you know the right people, or do you once again have stocks in this as well?
266 2018-10-23 21:28:36 Somehow I don’t think Milton thinks this is a great country because his stocks are doing so well.
267 2018-10-23 21:28:28 12yo: Friend X made $100 in 2 weeks trading stocks!
Me: long monologue on investing, biases, volatility, efficient markets...

Me: would you like $200 to get started in trading stocks?
12yo: nope!

268 2018-10-23 21:28:06 Two words.  Penny stocks.
269 2018-10-23 21:27:22 STOCKS: The next three weeks are scary for stocks.  Who will win  midterms?  How will trump react?  Will China & other foreign  investors dump stocks?  Will Europe & China stocks continue falling?   Will Mueller indict trump's family or be fired by trump?  So much  risk.

273 2018-10-23 21:25:05 This is my tin foil hat hypothesis-I think Powell wants and knows he needs to raise rates to normalise. BUT he can’t do it if mkt tanks. I’m wondering, if like today, there is a ‘helping hand’ that acts when stocks look ugly.
274 2018-10-23 21:23:05 Stocks closed lower Tuesday after climbing back from an early plunge, giving the benchmark S&P 500 index its fifth-straight loss.

276 2018-10-23 21:20:48 If you were lucky enough to beat EPS today, you only fell an average of 0.02%.  If you missed?  Average drop of the 19 stocks that missed was -7.19% today.
277 2018-10-23 21:19:05 Not a good day to report earnings.  The average change today of the 78 stocks that reported Q3 numbers since yesterday's close was -1.82%.  Ouch.
278 2018-10-23 21:18:37 Tyler sometimes meditate behind chem trails stocks .
279 2018-10-23 21:17:51 Stocks no longer operate under the "norm". Valuations on an individual and market level are no longer rational.

281 2018-10-23 21:16:03 no wonder stocks are falling...

283 2018-10-23 21:15:36 it’s a good day when your stocks is up :’)
284 2018-10-23 21:15:34 @vladtenev very pissed at your company. taking advantage of people who are trying to learn the stocks just so you can take all their fukcing money.

286 2018-10-23 21:15:17 Fact: 

Stocks were up 235% while @BarackObama was president.  The market doesn’t care who is president it only cares whether debt is cheap or expensive and how much stimulus Governments provide.  This entire recovery has been engineered 

@TheBubbleBubble @realDonaldTrump
287 2018-10-23 21:14:47 Heh, it is super hard. TBH, I have a soft spot for Ford since they restructured back in 06 and went from HG to HY and back to HG. Bonds are giving nice HY level yields ATM, I would dip into bonds before stocks for $F
288 2018-10-23 21:13:31 So on Fast Money they are pitching Apple and Health Care 

Of course nobody ever mentions the risk that these might be the stocks leading the next leg down. That's where the cash is.
289 2018-10-23 21:13:30 When profit target is hit, do you roll out in time with new position, or look for opportunity in a different ETF?  Do you keep balance with stocks, bond, commodity ETFs?  Thanks
290 2018-10-23 21:13:25 I don’t think it will roll over just yet. 2020 seems to be the best guess for recession in the US, but who knows. I think there are definitely more resilient stocks to own when this happens.

296 2018-10-23 21:10:35 Re: Tobin's Q.  What is the relevance of replacement cost for FB, AMZN, GOOG, AAPL, NFLX or even TSLA?

During earnings season, no one considers the Tobin's Q for a stock.  Why is an obsolete indicator, not used on individual stocks, good for market valuation?
297 2018-10-23 21:09:52 It fell on obummer too won’t you hold him accountable as well? The stocks fell, housing markets fell ever farther, based on your logic it was obum’s fault that it happened correct?
298 2018-10-23 21:09:46 Can we do 6 stocks with 2x leverage lol cause that usually works out really well
299 2018-10-23 21:08:17 ...Until the market becomes oversaturated.  Growers are going belly up in Oregon because the volume of cultivation FAR exceeds the demands of vendors.  If you invest in weed here you can actually watch your stocks go up in smoke.  At least it’s cheap.

301 2018-10-23 21:07:23 My positive returns this year (so far...) have been greatly helped by fortunately selling stocks before they plummeted #imm #tern and to a lesser extent #zoo
302 2018-10-23 21:06:42 Cash. You'd take a hit on taxes initially, but if you invest in an index fund and dividend stocks, the tax rate would be 15% or so for the rest of your life. On top of that, with the returns from the index fund, you'd probably make more than the 1.6B after 30 years.
303 2018-10-23 21:05:16 #StockMarket  Long-term stock trading:- Those who understand the difference between 'Stock Market' & 'Market of Stocks' will come out as a winner in the end.
304 2018-10-23 21:05:11 did these guys all get together and rehearse the same speech ? Kleenex stocks should really go up ,when we send all these low lifes a box or two. Pure babies

306 2018-10-23 21:04:34 "Prosecuted in many cases" ---> . Have you heard of 'penny stocks' recently?? You might want to create  the penny stock strike force as your price predictions are definitely not your field.
307 2018-10-23 21:04:12 I think it needs to be 11 stocks to meet 40 act rules.
308 2018-10-23 21:03:28 Honestly I don’t buy this argument. Derivatives exist in equity markets. Stocks *generally* have a fixed supply. The market still functions fine
309 2018-10-23 21:02:37 You dont even need stocks to do that mate 
310 2018-10-23 21:01:21 It smells and sounds real bearish out there. US stocks have barely fallen but everyone is scared, if only they would have looked at the rest of the world which has been collapsing since the start of the year. 

Interest rates up.

Asset prices down.

I'm in currencies, waiting...
311 2018-10-23 21:01:18 Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) price at close, 2018-10-23, is 294.14. #teslamotors #tesla #stocks #NASDAQ #elonmusk
312 2018-10-23 21:00:38 Interest rates raise, no significant tax cut for middle class, stocks down, stagnant wages. So who is the economy getting better and better for?
313 2018-10-23 21:00:29 I still remember when 9/11 happened and there was mention of looking at suspicious behavior like dumping or acquiring stocks to profit from the disaster and of course questioning people who were supposed to be on those flights or in the towers. Nothing ever came of that, LOL!

If people thought 2008 was bad, they haven't seen anything yet.

Crude is going way over $100,  unless policy changes. 
Either way, stocks are dirt cheap.

356 2018-10-23 20:39:25 it could be short sellers. And many other traders can make money if they bet the selling will be exhausted before the close. It could be investors ready to pick up stocks at more "affordable" prices.

370 2018-10-23 20:35:29 Until $SPY and $QQQ are sturdy and holding 5/10ema/21sma type levels on daily chart .. .and definitely the 5ma/10ema weekly averages... pot stocks are going to have a head wind from general market. Not good for a volatile spec sector.

372 2018-10-23 20:35:21 Tuesday true confessions:

Took a loss today trading profitable stocks. Uugh...  Just was in $CIDM at $1.20 and sold at $1.17 because I thought it was dropping. It hits $1.75 AH. Was going to rebuy $PLAG at $5.45 and didn't. It hit $7.50 AH.
373 2018-10-23 20:34:26 Nah more like Boeing and other defence stocks reporting this week. Another dead cat bounce
374 2018-10-23 20:33:51 Fact checking Trump sends people down a rabbit hole by making them take seriously his fanciful stories, which is exactly what he wants the media to do. He makes up false stories about the caravan b/c he doesn't want to talk about health care, soc. security, Khashoggi, stocks etc.
375 2018-10-23 20:33:27 $DISH, $CAT, $DCX, $WYNN, and $PCAR are the top five stocks that closed lower today.
376 2018-10-23 20:33:05 Stocks are way way overpriced. Its essentially fake fueled by low interest rates for a decade and stock buybacks. Many have gotten rich while stealing wealth from the future, in the end, the middle class will be wiped.

393 2018-10-23 20:26:20 Dow ends down 125 points, but downbeat finish belies a significant turnaround for stocks
394 2018-10-23 20:24:56 Wild day in the Market...Dow down over 500 points, but reverses to close down only -126.  Lot's of technical damage. Declining stocks were 2.5 times Advancing issues....74.8% (of 7400) stocks are < 200 DMAs.
395 2018-10-23 20:24:26 Stocks end way up from lows after a miserable morning fueled partly by disappointing earnings.
Dow closes -125, -0.5% to 25,191. Fell as low as 24,768.

Nasdaq -0.4%, S&P -0.6%.

10-yr Treasury yield falls as low as 3.11% as some investors sell stocks to buy bonds.

401 2018-10-23 20:22:49 To all my investors I heard a rumor that there is an investigation going on for fraud and deception of stock options for TD Ameritrade CEO I told you investors to not use this company as they just manipulate the stocks with their computer programs

416 2018-10-23 20:15:02 Stocks roared back after low open. Maybe market will rebound further tomorrow.

419 2018-10-23 20:13:52 Funny I had a dream on Sunday that you called my stock broker to tell me it’s time to buy stocks again. I wish I listened to “you”.
420 2018-10-23 20:13:39 Many companies are raising their minimum wage to $ 11 - 15 dollars an hour. Unemployment is at records lows. Stocks are down because of tariffs, relax and be patient no pain no gain
421 2018-10-23 20:13:27 If you look what this has done to guys like @LowLifeThugJakk @Steamsley @MackMel_GRECM @realfranchisenl stocks you have made these top guys or other up and comers come at #banned battlers they should keep it like that
422 2018-10-23 20:13:20 World stocks tumble: Europe -1.6%; US -.6%. Whether stock market recovers in several days or not, volatility here to stay. Market fragile because of slowing world growth, rising interest-rates & trade issues. It's expensive by some measures but below my lower S&P target of 2780.
423 2018-10-23 20:13:20 If there is anything I have learned about equity it’s that if you own good stocks, they  will go through cycles of ups  and downs, and every up is going to be higher than previous highs.
424 2018-10-23 20:12:49 AHAHAHAH 'Stocks by the Onion" That's funny-

430 2018-10-23 20:11:12 I'm sure they are doing fine with all those weed stocks they own on margin.
431 2018-10-23 20:11:10 Stocks: Exited short SP500 when -40 from yesterday. Went to -50, recovered to -15. Mixed opinion. The model shows the intra-month low is a couple of days away or so. But will that low be higher than today. Also, the more important low is due next week. Not yet long. Watching.
432 2018-10-23 20:11:06 Dude, anyone can make a website and add payment methods if they have bank accounts. The website you are mentioning looks very dodgy. It's giving some random info while it's claiming it's selling stocks. That's a typical fraud method.
433 2018-10-23 20:10:43 Stocks: Exited short SP500 when -40 from yesterday. Went to -50, recovered to -15. Mixed opinion. The model shows the intra-month low is a couple of days away or so.

434 2018-10-23 20:10:37 Even your own state tv says tariffs are causing stocks too drop!
435 2018-10-23 20:10:25 State income taxes have been in contention for a very long time now, and we actually have a hall tax that only taxes people drawing from any dividends, bonds, or stocks at around 6% (not your poor people for the most part). Imagine making 9% and paying back 2/3 of it every year.
436 2018-10-23 20:10:17 BULLETIN:
„U.S. stocks end off day‘s lows; Dow claws back from earlier 500-point drop.“

Does anybody get how ridiculous this statement sounds knowing that the FED has its own trading desk, rigging prices/markets in any direction they want as P.Volcker did w/ GLD in Reagan’s era!
437 2018-10-23 20:10:17 Jim. We’re going lower. Stop trying to convince people to buy stocks.
438 2018-10-23 20:09:00 @PetsatHome do you have the Pro Plan cat food back in stock yet? I gather a rebrand took place & stocks were unavailable until after that had taken place. Thanks.
439 2018-10-23 20:09:00 You again are showing your lack of knowledge of how and why stocks go up and down. Stock losses, like with CAT, are typical after results are announced! "Buy on the presumed good news, sell on the results!"
440 2018-10-23 20:08:55 neither can anyone elese ! that's why stocks are very inflated. People to stupid to see that fact !
441 2018-10-23 20:08:06 Stocks will suffer. The lefts goal is to destroy the economy Trump allowed to flourish so they can protect their foreign interests and make the president look bad.
442 2018-10-23 20:07:48 #Stocks end lower, but well off worst levels of the trading day. #Dow -126, #NASDAQ -31 #SP500 -15 @KNX1070 @MottekOnMoney
443 2018-10-23 20:06:13 I'm getting tired of investing in people. I could do better for myself like investing in Stocks, Classic cars, or a beet farm.
444 2018-10-23 20:06:12 Stocks - Dow Closes Lower Despite Clawing Back Bulk of 548-Point Slump
445 2018-10-23 20:06:10 From here, I believe the vast majority of the down move in the S&P is over. What comes next is quality stocks diverging from the pack. It feels that we can still go lower overall but on the long side you should be adding to your favorite names on days like today.
446 2018-10-23 20:05:48 As long as there’s one fish left in the water us Newfies will protest, fight, bitch and moan until we get it and then blame government and the union for mismanagement of the stocks. Any young person who chooses to get into the fishery as a career needs their heads checked.

449 2018-10-23 20:03:29 There were two days I have advocated buying #stocks recently, today and the big selloff on October 11. I would advocate some cash here as I believe this high volatility selloff is not done. Hard to pick bottoms and I don’t try to but today and Oct 11 were times to add to longs.
450 2018-10-23 20:03:22 Not a bad finish for Weed Stocks - some finished in the green today. Hope you took advantage of the bargains this morning.  Auxly -XLY.v under .90c was a steal!
451 2018-10-23 20:02:26 It could be that we’ve had a ten year run and stocks are a bit overextended. With the S&P selling a 21.5 times earnings it’s a bit rich the garbage that comes out of this White House is never ending

454 2018-10-23 20:01:51 Rates improved slightly today on lower than expected earnings on Wallstreet. Bad news in stocks is usually good for rates. :) Let me know if I can help with any of your financing needs.
455 2018-10-23 20:01:32 The problems to our south are starting to play a role in the attractiveness of stocks, especially home builders. I would NOT be a buyer of any real estate either. CASH. Hold cash.

459 2018-10-23 20:01:08 If votes had the weight of the net taxes paid, politics would reflect the reality better. While Ancap is ideal having voting run like stocks would undo the bribery the state does on it's electorate.

462 2018-10-23 19:59:47 Once again this #stockmarket selloff was not a convincing capitulation, probably means we have more to come. Buying the S&P when it was below 2700 this morning made sense. I do think we will get more opportunities to buy. This is not over yet but quality #stocks are buyable here
463 2018-10-23 19:58:44 IDK. The mkt doesn't want + oil $, as it works against their book (growth stocks). Might lead to mkt cognitive dissonance, where attention is paid to supportive narratives, while those opposing are faded. Oil price has defied "lower 4 longer", but belief remains, obviously.

466 2018-10-23 19:57:23 Nice! Many others can’t help but to focus on the negatives when stocks sell off. They resort to whining, complaining and pointing fingers to everyone besides themselves when times get tough. Those of you who can keep a clear head understand that sell-offs create opportunities
467 2018-10-23 19:57:21 "That reignited worries over the impact of rising borrowing costs, wages and tariffs on corporate profits, and caused S&P industrial stocks to slide"
HOW DARE WE HAVE TO PAY OUR EMPLOYEES!!!
468 2018-10-23 19:56:56 Always good to remember that during a bull market, growth stocks take the stairs up, but if earnings slow, they take the window down.
469 2018-10-23 19:56:45 The board wonders why they can't sell soup.

470 2018-10-23 19:56:19 Right... and as a former president he has 0 authority, 0 applicable training or skills, and the PD cant discuss any open investigation...

Wrong president to demand action from. 45 said hed ban bump stocks... until the NRA check cleared, then he forgot all about it....
471 2018-10-23 19:56:14 Yup....its been a problem on PXS ROK CNT and countless other stocks....how audit and remuneration committees allow it is beyond me.. but with Neil there ISN'T any chairman/NED etc
472 2018-10-23 19:56:07 Im  listening to your show. I gave and inside tip for those who want to invest a little money.  What would happen if the Republicans win the House and the Senate?

473 2018-10-23 19:55:10 The environment's not changing, still very difficult to trade indices. Another chop today. Rather look for stocks with relative weakness, because I don't think it's over just yet. $SPY $QQQ $DAX $XLF $SMH $SOXX
474 2018-10-23 19:55:09 Nah it was due! Feel like most names in my portfolio got hit harder than most stocks the last few days. Today they bounced back better than most too. It all works out.
475 2018-10-23 19:55:05 I am not paralyzed by fear with DJIA @25202. Therefore it is not a good time to buy stocks.
476 2018-10-23 19:54:39 I recall some Newcastle fans in a box behind me getting stick when they conceded the lead 3 times at OT to lose 4-3! #mufc
477 2018-10-23 19:54:32 (2/2) Truth is:
the stockmarket does not compensate for the deficit, but the deficit created by tax cuts for corporates and rich do inflate the stockmarket, because the 'tax profit' is used to buy (back) stocks. Not to invest. It is inflating stocks without adding real value.
478 2018-10-23 19:54:13 What stocks are good stocks in your eyes?
479 2018-10-23 19:53:59 I have stocks but no bonds

481 2018-10-23 19:53:54 @HunterZThompson They are running out of cannabis not only in Quebec, but pretty much everywhere, including here in Halifax. Stocks were already low in Canada the day it was legalized. In NS, they had cannabis only for three weeks for the entire province.
482 2018-10-23 19:53:46 Weaker dollar should help mining stocks, yes.

484 2018-10-23 19:53:22 U.S. home prices rise at slowest annual pace in six years. Global Stocks melt down. U.S. economy remains strong.
485 2018-10-23 19:53:12 @BarackObama did just that. If you own stocks, Rudy, then thank #Obama for paving the road for the @POTUS to pick up his mantle and help America continue to prosper.
486 2018-10-23 19:53:09 It means put on your big boy pants.

489 2018-10-23 19:52:37 And that was just the action in pot stocks

494 2018-10-23 19:49:39 It takes 2 to make a market.  I think you’re wrong.  We will see.  I think if stocks calm down that spread is higher in a hurry.
495 2018-10-23 19:48:51 Bullshit. Stocks are falling because of Trump’s disastrous policies.
496 2018-10-23 19:48:13 Lump, 10% metals, 25% real estate, 25% stocks, 25% bonds, 15% charitable trust.  Live off the bond interest.

498 2018-10-23 19:46:46 I'm probably the millionth person to suggest this, but invest in penny stocks to cure your chronic fatigue
499 2018-10-23 19:46:02 Kudlow talking ‘trade’ btwn Trump & Xi was just a cover to help turn stocks positive, besides the buybacks & plunge team intervening. They’ll do it over & over till they cant prop up market anymore.

507 2018-10-23 19:41:06 I agree!  Plus many Monte-Carlo simulations default the future expected returns for stocks and bonds based on how they performed over the past 35 years. Looks great to the client when told they can withdrawal 10% for 30 years w/o trouble.

516 2018-10-23 19:37:13 A ray of light in terms of support today in the major indexes and growth stocks. Wouldn't be surprised if we bounce from here. It's a nice first step, but be sure to keep perspective -- we're 5 hours off the low at this point and many stocks are in downtrends.
517 2018-10-23 19:36:40 Love thinking about winning the lottery and putting 70% of my millions in total stock market index, 20% in long term Treasury bonds, and keeping 10% as “fun“ (investments in strong value and growth stocks)

519 2018-10-23 19:36:15 Stocks and Yields are rebounding at Mid-Day today.  DOW is currently down only 53 and NASDAQ is down 9.  Earlier, the DOW was down over 500 and NASDAQ was down over 175.  Yields are now at 3.17%.  MBS is only up 9bps, so Lenders will re-price for worse on Mortgage Rates.

623 2018-10-23 18:59:44 Weak stocks are often strong  when market is weak !
624 2018-10-23 18:59:43 you can now see the usefulness of the MAXLIST and focusing on a few leveraged ETF's when looking for the "buy the dip" setup. Can get very overwhelming. Why we have  "focused" list.  #stocks
625 2018-10-23 18:59:34 Because I know we're not ALL in penny stock/pot stocks land, what's your favourite European bank over the next year or two?
Looking at $SAN, $DB, $ABNRY and $LYG. Leaning towards Santander or Lloyd's. No intention to buy any time soon, but watching.
626 2018-10-23 18:59:30 I am not the supporters of these kinds of photos, but I love your comments on stocks.
627 2018-10-23 18:59:12 Remember the bobber analogy. What stocks-Sectors after getting pushed down pop up the most. Right now Weed pot stocks showing incredible strength

629 2018-10-23 18:58:37 thanks, my avg is actually higher - never expected this big drop, which is why I always keep some fresh powder to add in these unexpected opportunities.  this should be back over $2 soon IMO.  and no worries always like discussing stocks 
630 2018-10-23 18:58:24 Stocks are dope and all but nigga i just lost $200 in two days and I didn't do a single thing. I literally woke up to a Yahoo finance notification letting me know I'm losing money.
631 2018-10-23 18:58:10 $amrn just give us longs the buyout news so we can move on and dump money into other cheap stocks.
632 2018-10-23 18:57:57 When markets dip, ask yourself... "are we currently in or headed for a recession?"  If your answer is "yes" prepare for volatility.  If your answer is "no", enjoy the opportunity to rebalance and buy stocks cheaper today vs. yesterday.
633 2018-10-23 18:57:52 If home building stocks need historic low interest rates to maintain, it is an unsustainable business model.  People built and purchased existing houses with interest rates 3-4x as high in the past.  These ARE extremely low rates.

636 2018-10-23 18:55:36 That’s democracy. Does every party explain or even stick too its manifestos which we are expected to vote for?? Leave had only 1 fact to work with as no other nation has ever left and that was the money paid in by the UK. Carney said as FACT that the stocks and £ would collapse
637 2018-10-23 18:55:32 All there is to Investing is picking good stocks at good times and staying with them as long as they remain good companies- Warren Buffet.

642 2018-10-23 18:53:23 Breadth improves, it’s very likely that we are seeing the lows for the quarter for stocks. There could be some backing and filling, but these lows should not be taken out much. BUY... $SPX
643 2018-10-23 18:52:52 i just looked at $WYNN it's 100 bucks...wow how those stocks have crashed 50% off sale from a few moths ago... this one doubles if / when #china #tarriffs   are settled

646 2018-10-23 18:51:57 What a nice turnaround in cdn bank stocks today. Hopefully the selling is getting exhausted and we can move back to the $75 dollar level 
647 2018-10-23 18:51:26 I hope the victim gets all the mental and physical support she needs to get her life back on track and this cowardly thief is watched seriously when he finishes this pathetically short sentence. After reviewing sentencing guidelines we should consider bringing back the stocks
648 2018-10-23 18:50:59 My stocks are still waaaay up even with this crazy month. You might want to rethink your investment strategy over blaming someone who has little control over those choices.
649 2018-10-23 18:50:30 Uhhhh, @realDonaldTrump you keep saying America is doing great economically, yet stocks continue to plunge and the deficit continues to rise. Wtf man??
650 2018-10-23 18:50:24 Your chemist decides what and how much they stock, not the government.
The UK maintains as the norm 12 weeks stocks of pharmaceuticals, the no deal idea is to add 6 more weeks
BTW I have always found Boots to be the worst, every time I've used them they have never fullfilled once
651 2018-10-23 18:49:59 The more I hear doom and gloom the more stocks I buy. Mr Market is getting irrational once again. More opportunities for the patient investor.
652 2018-10-23 18:49:58 Your knowledge of economics lead to bankruptcy. You did itnwith your own company but now you have a giant big company to play with. Tariffs are going to be the death of this economy but you can’t see that but my stocks are feeling it NOW. You are the worst thing to ever happen!
653 2018-10-23 18:49:52 Crypto will be more attractive as traditional stocks lose investor confidence and those people look for somewhere else to invest. A great idea would be a gold backed crypto token with guaranteed cash out availability a few years after purchase.
654 2018-10-23 18:49:46 I will say one thing: if I were a big money manager looking to exit stocks, I'd wait every day until the PPT has almost achieved its obvious objective (today it's the S&P500 200dma), and then I'd start dumping shares with a vengeance. Let's see what happens today ...
655 2018-10-23 18:49:45 Before the Citron "pump" I was about to make a prediction that $TSLA earnings tomorrow would single-handedly change the sentiment on high growth tech stocks. Which are at multi-months low recently.

I think the change has come 1 day earlier. 
656 2018-10-23 18:49:24 Cron is also canadian and the people i talk to said that certain weed stocks will definitely boom. BUT u gotta figure out which one lol
657 2018-10-23 18:49:02 Please hate somewhere else and leave the best ceo i can imagine alone.. if you people knew what is going behind the scenes then you would know that the sleeping giant is about to awake.. those stocks right now aren't 100% accurate and don't represent the future of atari..
658 2018-10-23 18:48:53 When I go to trading view to check charts, I’ll see TA for crypto. No one.... NO ONE is able to predict the price of crypto as well as others predict stocks. Crypto doesn’t behave like a stock. Stop asking for TA on it. Go with your gut, and STAY objective.
659 2018-10-23 18:48:41 Highly volatile stocks
660 2018-10-23 18:48:28 Wow, not often you get to see footage of people lining up to buy cannabis stocks.

666 2018-10-23 18:46:20 Today is a great day to buy weed stocks
667 2018-10-23 18:46:14 everyone should invest in stocks bru.. make money while you chilling, sleep.. shit simple as hell too
668 2018-10-23 18:46:02 You continue to prove why Trump loves you. You obviously believe anything he says & don't do your homework. Some people got raises, mostly the wealthy but higher health ins. & inflation makes that moot. The top 20% owned 92% of stocks. The majority of Amer. are not in the market
669 2018-10-23 18:45:40 This is an epic comeback today #stocks
670 2018-10-23 18:45:13 Lmao this can’t be real, Target never stocks their pops 
671 2018-10-23 18:45:13 Investing in stocks can be a gamble but you have to know which stock is a good investment. So far, so good.
672 2018-10-23 18:45:07 You can't even list stocks on the NYSE with a market buy and sell option in a timely manner. What difference does it make what computers you are using? Interactive Brokers, Schwab, all had ACB Aurora listed with Buy and Sell options. Not you. Just market sell. Add to panic.
673 2018-10-23 18:45:06 stocks could end the day green. lmao
674 2018-10-23 18:44:54 When I was there in May, I think I went home with..15 t-shirts. IL was clearing out stocks and was offering 50% EPP. I couldn’t resist.
675 2018-10-23 18:44:47 Lets see stocks tanking everything is getting more expensive thank trump for the winning
676 2018-10-23 18:44:23 Why you have to embarrass $TWTR? 
677 2018-10-23 18:44:18 Here's my stock tip of the day.  The past few days have ( finally ) created a buying opportunity.  Stocks have been so high.  FDX, ETN, ROP, IR, DHR, TDG, are all down.  After the Red Wave and The Wall starts to go up and then infrastructure projects, these are all exceptional.
678 2018-10-23 18:43:55 STOCKS ARE BACK!! $SPX $SPY  (now to rebuy everything in my IRA that I sold this morning)
679 2018-10-23 18:43:54 If anyone is in Wakefield this Saturday I'm speaking at the famous "Red Shed" for Wakefield Socialist History Group on "Class Conflict in the Countryside" alongside Robin Stocks from 1pm to 4pm.
680 2018-10-23 18:43:44 Yup you have to be lucky that the pharmacy even stocks half this stuff knew sometimes it could a pain getting my allopurinol in the batch required and that was just a month's worth of prescription on a drug that's more frequently stocked . Still I'm sure thing "will be fine
681 2018-10-23 18:43:34 thanks as well , i do see people already asking for higher prices in stocks
682 2018-10-23 18:43:12 Yes if you hold cash or other asset which is available to switch to equity... With such sharp correction in quality stocks, you will feel that you are blessed..

I m feeling blessed.
683 2018-10-23 18:43:04 I get what you're trying to do here, but now that I know stocks are public (and now know what Smith holds), I can watch and see if she votes in her own best interest instead of MNans'. If I see her sell us out, I'll look at other candidates. Right now I know Housley is a sellout.

699 2018-10-23 18:39:28 Oil prices fall more than 4 percent as investors sell off stocks amid concerns about slowing global economic growth. Saudi Arabia's energy minister seeks for a second straight day to assure markets that the kingdom will keep the world adequately supplied with crude.
700 2018-10-23 18:39:17 Why don't you do something simple like provide market buy and sell for NYSE listed stocks? You have a market sell only option for ACB. It was populated to ACB from ACBFF at midnight. You are only ADDING to the sell off an panic. Very irresponsible. Simply do not have a sell only.

707 2018-10-23 18:36:39 Absolutely correct. That is exactly how this market works and why it is so different from all the other commodities. One minute your sitting on a ew penny stocks...next minute they are worth a fortune. Just wait that is all you have to do. My estimate remains at late 2020.
708 2018-10-23 18:35:39 We could put reesmug and his cronies in the stocks and pelt them with rotten fruit if they are not suitably humiliated by a u turn ?
709 2018-10-23 18:35:23 @petenajarian on a rally day U say people should buy quality stocks, I ask U same question when its down 500 points, U are such a chicken shit U refuse to say yeah really buy quality names now....tells me just another guy who reacts to what is happening at that second...
710 2018-10-23 18:35:14 $MCGI It's amazing to me how many flippers of stocks are out there! Instead of doing a little DD they jump in out of stocks making a few bucks vrs thousands. Don't get me wrong I know there's a place for flipping a stock... DD will tell you the difference between a LONG or FLIP!
711 2018-10-23 18:35:12 Another 3-week dip keeps #uranium stocks range-bound, despite the metal sitting at 2-year highs. What is your opinion on how this price divergence will play out through the end of the year?

713 2018-10-23 18:34:39 Not bi watching stocks last few days, feeling shit aft some quite harsh treatment medical wise. Markets look like they just sliding or going sideways, not a time for playing selling or buying just stick in there and wait for the turn. gl
714 2018-10-23 18:34:09 My fault the put on the weed stocks someone’s up right now
715 2018-10-23 18:34:08 Not surprising. Stocks overvalued compared to LT P/E trends, inflation becoming an issue, Trump Tariffs affecting businesses, increased risk perception deterring investment & raising profit/return requirements, resentment against US affecting international business...

721 2018-10-23 18:30:50 Ok je vais faire des stocks de popcorn!
722 2018-10-23 18:30:47 If in fact the lows of today for pot stocks are not going to be revisited again, and the bounces are sustained and move higher, then in retrospect this morning's continued selloff was capitulation??
723 2018-10-23 18:30:44 Thanks for the info on stocks, but it doesn't change my calculus between the candidates. I'm not seeing Smith working on behalf of her stock companies. I saw Housley cave to corporate interests on protecting seniors, her #1 issue, for which she declared "We won."
724 2018-10-23 18:30:31 And by the way, invest in tequila stocks now before all the other engineers notice this and realise they have five months to tackle the new millennium bug.
725 2018-10-23 18:30:27 couldnt resist snagging some MPX this am since im light on US pot stocks
726 2018-10-23 18:27:19 Let's wait how the market will evolve with Bakkt. They are going to create a layer between the crypto market and investors. It looks like they want to get the control of the market like banks with stocks. We are going to see BTC pumping however it has a price, maybe expensive...
727 2018-10-23 18:26:34 Savings, crypto and stocks are far better than credit, loans, and pawn shops.
728 2018-10-23 18:26:20 Should I start investing in stocks?
729 2018-10-23 18:25:47 Lunch must've been good in lower Manhattan....stocks are well off the day's lows, when the Dow was in a 500 point spiral.  Dow -140 at the moment. TSLA +12% on several bullish analyst notes, MCD and VZ surging on strong earnings. MMM and CAT continue to drag on tariff impacts.
730 2018-10-23 18:25:45 Some stocks like $T and $CMCSA still doing good.
731 2018-10-23 18:25:41 Stocks going up again. Fintwit back out of hiding
732 2018-10-23 18:25:32 201 stocks in the S&P 500 are more than 20% below their 52-week high. Of the 32 stocks with market caps over $150 billion, only three are 20% below their high.
733 2018-10-23 18:25:08 @AOTtrades do you think we may see a gap up (green) tomorrow in the market? Do you think a reversal may finally be in play? I’m hesitant to go long on stocks I’m looking at
734 2018-10-23 18:24:29 @Rupper17 is there anywhere I can buy a few of your pro stocks? I lost a good soldier last night 
735 2018-10-23 18:23:45 And even after taking gains on our triple-short index fund this morning (SRTY), the open Supercycle Investor portfolio is now higher on the day. Cannabis and gold stocks leading the way higher, uranium still snoozing. Wild, wild market.
736 2018-10-23 18:23:36 My stocks are looking like shit.
737 2018-10-23 18:20:56 Is it economic growth then that keeps trashing the markets? Everyone's IRAs going down while earnings go up? 25% average earnings growth yet stocks get clobbered when they meet or beat, 3+Q now.
738 2018-10-23 18:20:18 will stocks close green lol
739 2018-10-23 18:20:16 Mark, I would suggest Trump does have an option here that he’s banking on... letting time pass. Trump has discovered that no matter how much uproar there is over an event, the news cycle will move on. It can be ignored 

Bump stocks?
Putin meeting?
Parkville?

It all goes away.
740 2018-10-23 18:20:01 Agreed, new stocks arrivng tomorrow and will refund/exchange anyone who was not happy with the current quaility! Very sorry for your experience and thank you. Cheers
741 2018-10-23 18:19:42 Every day appear Fed's member and basic all narrating the same dull info..
It's clear intention to scare & determine investors sell stocks and buy bonds... pathetic
742 2018-10-23 18:19:15 $HRL makes new all time high... not too many stocks doing that... must be that pizza commercial  …
743 2018-10-23 18:19:14 Good thing I average down from $33.85 to $31.05.  Never will I doubt you again.  Your stocks picks is on point and I need to play smaller so I don’t get rattle.   Thank you.
744 2018-10-23 18:18:50 Cannabis stocks, like crypto currencies, other hot sectors before them are bubbles. Investors hear stories of 30 something yr old millionaires, fear missing out, cause stock prices to inflate ... then tank. Always the same.
745 2018-10-23 18:18:40 Thank you @Westcreekbc for sharing this story. With many communities in BC working to restore  local sockeye runs, I appreciate learning about salmon ranching and possible impacts to  wild stocks. PS  - would love to visit your inland facility.
746 2018-10-23 18:18:26 Could be completely wrong, but wealthy individuals moving assets around probably move the markets more than anything. When bond yields are up, it’s best to hold cash and bonds. Otherwise risk assets (stocks, crypto) are in play, generally
747 2018-10-23 18:18:00 LME #copper #nickel stocks keep drawing yet trade wars weigh thats 'fake news' as #trump would say. Supply vs demand expect rallies to come in both #HZM #ARS #ARCM oh and last two also sporting 2.5m oz and 3m oz #gold respectively
748 2018-10-23 18:17:51 Yeah I know how that is. I multitask way too much too....You trade stocks for a living?
749 2018-10-23 18:17:43 Not mean to be just an equity comparison but rather the broader asset class world. It extends beyond just stocks. There are a few aberrations along the way in which US stocks are structurally ill-prepared (1970s). A thoughtful investor, understanding this, should prepare for it.
750 2018-10-23 18:16:39 In addition to being one of the high flying momo tech stocks, AAPL’s valuation allows it to be the safety NQ trade.
751 2018-10-23 18:15:57 Hard to believe that you and @CNBC have no mention of @Tesla up 11% when most stocks are down big today!
752 2018-10-23 18:15:48 The FS Investors hasn't financed or build anything for the last 20 yrs.  Majority of investors are out of town hedge funds people looking to buy land, properties, & stocks at distressed prices & to flip it for huge profits. SDSU on the other hand has been serving SD for 121 yrs.
753 2018-10-23 18:15:47 You are the reason why stocks are plummeting.
754 2018-10-23 18:15:32 Let’s also not forget that the Dems claimed Trump would sink the economy as soon as he was elected.  Remember the elation from the media when stocks fell after the election.  It’s the current admins policies that have allowed the economy to take off.
755 2018-10-23 18:14:56 she stocks there (I've been told to say)
756 2018-10-23 18:14:42 Only dips worth buying are in crypto, not stocks
757 2018-10-23 18:13:59 God also helps those who recommend good stocks during correction.
758 2018-10-23 18:13:48 @McClellanOsc  I think you got your flush. At least 4 few days. Trump tariffs and interest rates still hvy on stocks
759 2018-10-23 18:13:43 @amazon Since I was only 12 or so in 2001 when your stock was around $12 a share, any way you'd let me get in on your stocks at that rate? Ask Jeff. Thanks in advance.
760 2018-10-23 18:13:39 @MacFromTha12 yo fam! Do Robin Hood cover penny stocks? I'm trying to get started by investing in penny stocks.
761 2018-10-23 18:13:32 Stocks are falling because there’s no end in sight to the trade war and company earnings are reflecting that challenge. That and imminent inflation and higher interest rates
762 2018-10-23 18:13:07 Would love to get the crowds view on Marijuana Stocks today.
Are they...
763 2018-10-23 18:13:03 Only surefire way to succeed at shorting stocks is with 'inside information'. Otherwise it is a high risk high reward move to make.
764 2018-10-23 18:12:13 I do drop the normal salt addition. No more than in a lot of stocks though.
765 2018-10-23 18:11:39 Twitter just trying to protect their TESLA/Boring Co. stocks.

767 2018-10-23 18:11:23 You seem to be positive on $RRR stock is getting wacked along with the rest of the casino stocks. According to Yahoo Finance trading for 1/2 it's enterprise value for whatever that is worth. Station Casino used to be a real dump, have not been there in a while.
768 2018-10-23 18:11:11 $AAPL is the coup de gras for the bears. Attrition against all the other tech stocks will eventually wear away a support for the top dog.
769 2018-10-23 18:11:08 So......yes. No? Just tell me if I should sell all my stocks or not!

772 2018-10-23 18:10:16 One of the biggest cons ever is the Dow. It’s 30 stocks. So all 30 can be down, but the other 2770 on the nyse can be up. See the problem? It’s just a fake number- up or down. #StockMarket
773 2018-10-23 18:10:11 Love those stocks! And QLD/SSO also.
774 2018-10-23 18:10:09 REALLY? Caterpillar and 3M Stocks plunge, sending the Dow tumbling in pre-market trading.

782 2018-10-23 18:07:27 I have noticed a distinct pattern of down days in the $SPX and Treasury distributions. It's almost as if the US treasury is taking money out of stocks and redistributing it to Treasury holders


783 2018-10-23 18:07:16 Average down but only on stocks that are debt free, high roce, some moat, sector leaders, special business etc.

787 2018-10-23 18:04:57 While it was at one point thought to be an industry with a bright future, investors should be cautious buying into marijuana. Recent studies have revealed an increase in stroke risk paired to marijuana use, causing industry stocks to pummel. #SUACCF18
788 2018-10-23 18:04:42 What a lovely day to invest in some stocks
789 2018-10-23 18:04:19 Bruh at least someone teach how to buy stocks! And at least show me how it works!
790 2018-10-23 18:03:54 Currently well under water on 3 stocks #YU., #FDEV & #HYNS. (18% - 28%). In normal markets I would have sold & taken the hit but this market is taking all boats lower. Any views out there?
791 2018-10-23 18:03:39 May see bounce  but I would go bullish on stocks that show strength on a day like today...
792 2018-10-23 18:03:21 obviously investors see a blue Wave  and have been selling off stocks in fear of the Democrat Party taking over and destroying the economy

Reasons are as follows:
1) I want stocks that don't need to raise fund to keep the lights on (this market makes raising hard)
2) I want high impact news with a low mcap (bloe has a gas play)
797 2018-10-23 18:02:25 I think vulnerability is what makes content dope these days.

BREAKING:  Caterpillar and 3M Stocks plunge, sending the Dow tumbling in premarket trading.

Caterpillar blames Trump's tariffs for rising supply costs, equating to lower earnings expectations.

Dear Donald, 

I told you this would happen, Mr. Stable Genius.
809 2018-10-23 17:57:58 They’ve been a little more selective about who they shadowban after their stocks tanked when it came out in the media they were doing so. It seems they’ve moved from shadow bans to outright bans.
810 2018-10-23 17:57:21 Asia stocks finish broadly lower after strong gains a day earlier
811 2018-10-23 17:57:05 "Stocks just broke a key level and what’s next could decide fate of bull market"

The stock market NEVER had faith in @realDonaldTrump and now that he is screwing with the OBAMA RECOVERY, investors can sense the change to the TRUMP REVERSAL.

The TRUMP REVERSAL is a CLIFF!
812 2018-10-23 17:56:56 One simple rule that will save your portfolio from ruin: Do no go long any stocks when $SPX is below its 200 SMA.
813 2018-10-23 17:55:52 Looks like the recent recovery was a false dawn so I have been selling some of my recent Buys this week. Mainly bought on the last dip & now sold - #CLIN, #XPP, #CCC, #PMP, #IGR, #NMC, #ZYT (thanx Questor). All for v small profits. Now 11 stocks held 85% Cash. 
814 2018-10-23 17:55:04 So... you're telling me, for 400 years, it was not economical to profit off the backs of slaves?

Do you even know why/how Wall Street started?

They were selling Bonds & Stocks... human slaves!!!!
815 2018-10-23 17:55:02 did they reboot xiv, bc if not penny stocks
816 2018-10-23 17:54:52 I use all of them, actually I will carry a large tool box with all kinds of styles and methods to secure a winner. I’ve nailed stocks down, ripped the old ones loose, I trend sold at highs, and used my technicals to pinpoint a winner with forward earnings. Don’t limit yourself.
817 2018-10-23 17:54:04 “The Economy” also tends to improve based upon perception, just like stocks. With a Republican Congress solidifies, it started to improve because lame-duck O’Bama couldn’t really affect it, legislatively. When it seemed Hillary might actually *not* win, things started taking off.
818 2018-10-23 17:53:39 "Screw the Dow just buy Biotech Penny stocks.. you can't lose"

819 2018-10-23 17:52:29 Nice!!  Yeah. Only stuff I have are dividend stocks. Other than that I had all puts. I’m about 75% cash now. Loving it. Ready to scalp more puts.
820 2018-10-23 17:52:18 If you get into OTC stocks and come across certain plays, you will become addicted nowhere else can you find the gains that the OTC can produce with either little money involved or even a larger position if you are trading the trade > 
821 2018-10-23 17:52:02 Stocks shudder on Wall Street following steep drops overseas
822 2018-10-23 17:51:43 @DasarteYarnway @jimcramer @petenajarian Does any member of Congress loose money on their stocks or are their stocks frozen not to fall below their purchase price? Stock market for Congress is treated a little different than for the rest of USa? Thank you

829 2018-10-23 17:50:26 Wats ur take on stocks tat r not falling as much as the leading indices?
830 2018-10-23 17:50:17 ... time for America's plan is the worst economical deals in the worst performing stocks on the arm and yanked me me down.
831 2018-10-23 17:50:00 Huge reversal in weed stocks today!!! Managed to sell only down 20% on my calls started basically worthless
832 2018-10-23 17:49:37 14 stocks advanced as 19 stocks declines; TRANSCORP (+9.60%), HONYFLOUR (+4.35%) and FBNH (+4.32%) led the gainers chart while FIRSTALUM (-9.09%), PZ (-7.66%) and MCNICHOLS (-7.41%) led the losers chart for the day.
833 2018-10-23 17:49:36 No, I just started trading stocks this year. Kind of thought the same thing the first day I started trading. What goes up eventually comes down. I still have a lot to learn though.
834 2018-10-23 17:47:55 the power of the Sq of 9 shows itself as the $SPX kiss/backtests 2728 which is 360 down from 2741 high.
this is how the sq of 9 helps every day in stocks and the indices..it's not just for big picture analysis.
835 2018-10-23 17:47:43 Typical pleb response. Avg every day Americans invest in stocks. Plebs (you) spend on bullshit or leave it in a savings account.

839 2018-10-23 17:46:40 Sammy Arnold or François Steyn would add quality to our stocks
840 2018-10-23 17:46:16 Good time to be buying some stocks and averaging down on current holdings.
841 2018-10-23 17:46:14 Another Crazy day with the pot stocks? Still hard to find legal weed to buy...except online... oh wait... Canada Post is on strike ....

843 2018-10-23 17:45:43 European stocks close lower in wake of global rout
844 2018-10-23 17:45:35 The Stock Market can be a Volatile place as we are still seeing > Big Boards, OTC or Crypto, it doesn't matter.

Trading vs. Investing

What types of stocks do you look for to trade or invest in and what is the ROI you expect in return, What type of percentage gains ?
845 2018-10-23 17:45:17 Ladies and gentlemen,

I hope you realize that the stocks took a plunge today because all of these pointless tariffs have caught up.

It takes a substantial amount of time for the tariffs to hit the stock market, but they just did.

Thank Trump by voting Democrat this November
846 2018-10-23 17:44:43 Democrats do NOT want to take away the 2nd Amendment. THEY CAN'T. They just want to restrict access to dangerous weapons like semiautomatics, bump stocks, & assault weapons. Democrats aren't trying to restrict free speech but TRUMP is!
847 2018-10-23 17:44:08 La réception des stocks peut différer selon les fournisseurs, c'est une question de jours : merci pour votre patience. :)

849 2018-10-23 17:43:43 They want to talk about anything except the fact that Republicans are going after your Social Secuity.

They want to take away your healthcare.

Your stocks are going down. Trumps economic policy is failing.

Do you really want to be the people that are fooled all the time?
850 2018-10-23 17:43:39 Nice move on tops and Dcix need vol to burn bears , eod could be interesting . Weed stocks heating up . Took small position in igc
851 2018-10-23 17:43:33 As long as Dumb Sheep follow Trump Stock Holders CASH IN at least 60% more than Middlclass and most. So Michugan Trumpests how much STOCKS you own? Ans: Only 2% of America invest in Stocks. Less than 1% in Michigan. They tend to trust 401Ks more if received from their jobs.

Big pharma and high biotech hate these lowly powerful molecules

855 2018-10-23 17:42:55 #RealEstate and #Auto sales are in decline. Even their #Stocks are tanking. This of course is due to higher #InterestRates and will continue to get worse and worse as rates continue to go higher. 

Of course the #FederalReserve is oblivious or worse ignorant to this.
856 2018-10-23 17:42:53 Looking at tomorrow's @edinburghpaper on the stocks just now. Not too shabby at all. Strong splash and some good strong exclusives inside. Top work throughout the book by a team of dedicated reporters. #buyapaper #scotpapers

858 2018-10-23 17:41:11 Pot stocks are such a wild ride. Some major claw back after the massive post legalization sell off.. Yet many already recovering since today's open.

At this point I'm almost numb to these crazy swings. Don't panic, hold patiently. Remember this industry is just getting started.
859 2018-10-23 17:41:08 dividend yielding stocks under 25$? suggestions?

877 2018-10-23 17:35:29 @skynews reporting stocks falling - so? Its October, there is always a sell off/drop in October in general terms (school fees, christmas coming, etc) . But lets not mention the big ones...
878 2018-10-23 17:35:10 Just using this support area to start piecing into good looking individual stocks. No reason to have a position in SPY/QQQ with internals still looking like they do. Still in the camp that we see consolidation between $COMP 7200-7800 for awhile.
879 2018-10-23 17:34:55 Exactly. I *should* be 6-1 by all play but am now in a race at 4-3 because came down to Giorgio Tavecchio hitting a long field goal and Eli not passing for the 2 pointer. Stuff like that makes it fun.

It would feel like just investing in long term stocks otherwise.
880 2018-10-23 17:34:53 Sourcing stocks hahaha check out Goliath Resources could be the next big rocket 
881 2018-10-23 17:34:50 So much for market seasonality. Markets remain stagnant 
Uranium equities lag spot price. Lithium ETF dips below 30$. Only good news is that junior mining stocks are a bargain and could very well move lower.

4. Huge Short Positions in the System.
5. Pesimism @ the Highest Level.
885 2018-10-23 17:33:35 Instead Banking stocks i will like to buy those stocks and stories who having less dependency on govt policies and  regulations and having solid balance sheet but price  just beaten too badly due to rumors and bloodbath in market.

888 2018-10-23 17:32:32 No military in the world uses bump stocks nor AR platform rifles ... as civilians, our right to own military carbines is virtually banned (i.e., infringed upon).

And “hunting”?  I’m Jewish, and don’t hunt.

But I do own an AR-15 for personal defense and securing a free state.
889 2018-10-23 17:32:24 stocks and bonds:
• risky
• cant buy them at costco
• probably gonna get finessed by      corporate america 
selling little debbie’s labeled “not for individual resale” individually:
• easy money for grinders
• big boy bread to be made
• can get you the nickname “snacks”

894 2018-10-23 17:30:52 McDonalds is bucking trend in stocks today
because investors understand losses on Wall Street,

My opinion;
although massive upgrade at 1000 stores per month
is going on; McD stock is rising.
Sell the rest; @GOP is profit taking.

904 2018-10-23 17:28:34 84% of stocks are owned by the top 10% of investors. My own eyeballs tell me that, as the market has climbed to each of its new record highs, the homeless camps in Oakland have also grown. The "public discussion" stays focused on the concerns and prerogatives of the owner class.

911 2018-10-23 17:27:26 I agree but in the short term as long as the money is cheap stocks will go back up. The bond market will be the thing that kills the stock market and the powers that be will get all the dumb money short and then cause a squeeze.

1004 2018-10-23 17:07:24 #Weed stocks have plummeted so much in the few days since Canada legalized it that it seems like a great time to go long. Put in a limit for $ACB since it dropped so much after hitting the NYSE two days ago. Also looking at the $MJ ETF for simplicity.
1005 2018-10-23 17:07:06 Who would have guessed #pot stocks would lead the way out of the market rout today?
1006 2018-10-23 17:06:27 1/4 Would I buy here? YES I would, and here is why (#Nasdaq , #Stocks):

When I see these levels, I should consider buying:

 S&P 500 touches lowest level in 5 months
 Dow Jones touches lowest level in almost 4 months
 Nasdaq dips to nearly 6 month low
1007 2018-10-23 17:06:13 The CEOs of major corporations used their tax cuts to buy stocks in their own companies.  Now they have made substantial profits they’re selling their shares, that why the prices are so low.  Usually rats don’t jump onto a sinking ship. Come back and let us know how it turns out

1014 2018-10-23 17:04:05 Absolutely. It's pure horse . If tariffs were so great, the stock market would be reflecting it. And stocks haven't done squat in 2018, since tariffs were enacted.

1051 2018-10-23 16:55:39 Is that why stocks are down .
1052 2018-10-23 16:55:23 *insert 150 year chart* see, stocks always go up over time.
1053 2018-10-23 16:55:11 Interesting. Thoughts on effect on crypto and stocks? Historically, falling bond yields equate to rising stock and risk assets. However, correlation is not always 1:1
1054 2018-10-23 16:54:43 Blind trust stocks? No senate candidate in Minnesota has blind trust stocks.  Their investments are disclosed. This is about divesting conflicts.
Housley is a bad choice for other reasons (principally her loyalty to Trump) but not because of anything having to do with her stocks.
1055 2018-10-23 16:54:13 Profits are huge in stocks compared to index.
1056 2018-10-23 16:54:04 We become weak below 10405 close..the moment we go below jan low...years gain wiped out..so oct close should be above it....max one month we can close below it...uf second month close below 10405...then we have a TOPI IN ALL STOCKS

1059 2018-10-23 16:53:22 To say the least, cannabis stocks have been notably under pressure the past week. Since reaching a new all-time high on Oct 16, shares of Aurora are down nearly 40% - they aren’t alone either. Tongue in cheek; that’s a lot of money up in smoke...
1060 2018-10-23 16:53:19 Of course he did Sean. If you could only analyze data you would see that the US was trending higher GDP, lower unemployment, higher stocks etc. all because of @BarackObama .  Thanks Barack.    Don't be a talking head....use your head.
1061 2018-10-23 16:53:12 Tech stocks are dropping because of a selloff. Tariffs are creating an unstable situation for both imports and exports.
Don't believe the hype. This will not be the financial bonus you think.
Ask yourself this. Why did other presidents not do this? Were they stupid or cowards?
1062 2018-10-23 16:52:41 @steveliesman Thanks for calling out the Trade War as major contributor to this downturn. Infuriating that pro-trump pundits ignoring tariff damage ( $F, $xhb) and blaming it on 3% from the Fed. #Navarro and #trump don’t understand economics and are destroying stocks, econ next.
1063 2018-10-23 16:52:08 It was more of a joke about how anything that Elon Musk tweeted about brought down the value of Tesla stocks.
1064 2018-10-23 16:52:02 happening now ... $XBI up 3% and more since my tweet and single stocks (most of them) still in deep red.
They need some very green days to bounce hard,
$XBI best one to trade a fast bounce (or $LABU)
1065 2018-10-23 16:52:01 Obama's stocks was down stayed down wake up troll
1066 2018-10-23 16:51:51 Investors in the stock market may oscillate between the fear of missing out and the fear of losing money. 

After prices trend up, they may wish they had more exposure. 

After stocks fall, they may regret having as much exposure.

1070 2018-10-23 16:50:43 no one is making money in the stocks today
1071 2018-10-23 16:50:23 3M and Caterpillar stocks have taken a dive, causing the DOW to plunge almost 400 points today. Caterpillar has blamed the trade war tariffs for significant rising costs in supply. So much winning.
1072 2018-10-23 16:50:11 October has been even worse for the Nasdaq. The index, down 9% this month, is on track for its worst month since November 2008 when it plummeted 11%. Tech stocks, once the bright spot in the market, continued to take the brunt of the selling on Tuesday. All Is well. Yeah right!
1073 2018-10-23 16:50:07 Growth stock investing as practiced in the mainstream today is basically intellectualized speculation. Basically you are attempting to ride the rising momentum of other excited investors.  True long term growth=value! #invest #stocks #investing #Money #Finance #Economics #Market

1088 2018-10-23 16:46:08 There's nothing that confuses new investors like this line "equities (stocks) have outperformed other asset classes in (insert your favourite long term horizon)".

This is misleading because it promotes buy & hold which doesn't work. Don't even talk about index investing.
1089 2018-10-23 16:45:54 And — stocks dropped another 400 points this morning.

1091 2018-10-23 16:45:29 I’m close to break even on several on my stocks and went from a 100% gain in $uuuu to 66ish. Sigh. Ah well. Will be curious if the market flips before we get our uranium bull market.
1092 2018-10-23 16:45:13 If liberals were sensible they would know that our economy is booming, & their stocks are rising. The liberals should know that they’re more jobs & less unemployment. The liberals are ignoring the  “caravan,” for what it is Invaders undermining our sovereignty.
1093 2018-10-23 16:45:12 You're too bullish... This is the beginning of the end of the secular bull market regardless what the Fed or Trump or whoever does what... Stocks are just too overvalued. There will be powerful countertrend rallies but the trend is shifting. @DavidSkarica @tradermike_1999

1100 2018-10-23 16:44:08 Coincidence that all the selected stocks fell after DSN fell from power ? That's unlikely. Like I keep saying politicians don't really care. These people make billions while we pay taxes. U r getting too emotionally invested
1101 2018-10-23 16:44:04 
1102 2018-10-23 16:43:49 Instead learning about stocks & would like your honest advice about this stock, is good to invest in it?
1103 2018-10-23 16:43:23 There are a lot of stocks on sale today! Choose wisely...
1104 2018-10-23 16:42:55 I don't disagree with that. From the perspective of the stocks in the broad energy sector, lower price oil doesn't necessarily mean bad news.  Refiners for example tend to benefit from cheaper oil.

And I thought I'd get away with it, oh shame on me.
1108 2018-10-23 16:42:36 No. Stocks are falling because of Trump’s tariffs and other wonky schemes

1120 2018-10-23 16:39:24 Equally accurate headline that @CNBC could have tweeted:  "Stocks decline because President Trump did not die in his sleep."
1121 2018-10-23 16:38:57 Well, one comment for hanergys plan pay at least 5HK$ per share for shareholders. I think 10Hk$ would be fair, i know few poeple who payd more than 5HK$ (or Eurocent) for their stocks, and they would loose lots of money. But i would see a future trading best choice.

1163 2018-10-23 16:28:48 Certainly there needs to be a large stock of fixed-price instruments/"money" (checking/MM deposit balances) to allow for portfolio churn. Sell bonds for "cash," buy stocks or RE. Cuz everybody wants to settle trades in those fixed-price instruments. Credit provides that "money."

1176 2018-10-23 16:25:06 I said real assets are driven by credit not stock prices. In secondary markets paper gains or losses (without margin) are caused by turnover averaging up (or averaging down) prices as the last sale. Set liabilities to zero in economy then there are no stocks and no money either.
1177 2018-10-23 16:25:02 I'm long since 2013.  Adding on dips.  Think it is the real kind of long-term hold stocks. Balance Sheet is ugly, but the vision of this compagny just is just amazing.

1217 2018-10-23 16:15:52 ...or stocks are falling due to blackout periods, which means corporations aren't buying back their own stock to prop up growth like they have been doing for the past year

1230 2018-10-23 16:13:39 If the market can close near top of range this is a classic bottoming pattern. Again, if, this is a great day to buy especially pot stocks. Many were clobbered at open down 10-20% and have since recovered a bit.

1237 2018-10-23 16:10:47 If $CAT is your best idea for an oversold bounce play you are ignoring 100's of smaller stocks.
1238 2018-10-23 16:10:21 With all these stocks/index's 'breaking down. Is it insanity to 'double down' after dropping 10% on $TNA?
1239 2018-10-23 16:10:21 @larry_kudlow did you suck the lies out of the Toad? Not on @FoxNews anymore but still lies. Tariffs, rising costs, trade war with China created by this corrupt administration is why stocks are falling. @reaDonaldTrump
1240 2018-10-23 16:10:16 This beautiful fall in oil can support the long end by lowering the inflation expectations. I think it is a breather for stocks too. $CL_F #OOTT $ES
1241 2018-10-23 16:09:45 stocks never just go straight down, they have a relief period, by the end of the month coroporate buybacks will be allowed but everyone is losing confidence in the market. The DJI, SPX and Nasdaq all below 200 day MA, looking shaky.
1242 2018-10-23 16:09:34 How are stocks prices and sales since you announced production in China?
1243 2018-10-23 16:08:55 Don't let it get you down.  All the pot stocks are down (manipulated) this will reverse.
1244 2018-10-23 16:08:39 stocks down, yields down, oil down, dollar down... no one's allowed to make money today lol
1245 2018-10-23 16:08:36 @wesbury what is the P/E ratio on the S&p 500 now versus the beginning of the year? I think stocks have to look extremely cheap now vs. then, no?
1246 2018-10-23 16:08:35 You finding more value in any income stocks today?  REITs and preferreds hardly down at all.
1247 2018-10-23 16:08:26 You can buy em everywhere as far as I know. A guy was telling me he’s making a killing trading pot stocks

1249 2018-10-23 16:07:53 If the spot price hikes and hikes, I think U stocks will be like gold, a safe haven in difficult times. That's the reason I  bought U stocks after a 9 years bull market.
1250 2018-10-23 16:07:52 More absolute smokage in the markets in stocks like $NKE $NVDA $CVX and $SPY $SPX $DJIA $USO etc
1251 2018-10-23 16:07:31 Many of the names I'm looking at or am buying would have to have at least 20% earnings cuts to not look very cheap- could happen but also don't think will get their on q3 reports- so either wrong on magnitude of guides or stocks catch back up- we'll see
1252 2018-10-23 16:07:31 U.S. home prices rise at slowest annual pace in six years. Global Stocks melt down. U.S. economy remains strong.
1253 2018-10-23 16:07:22 This is probably why stocks are taking a dive.
1254 2018-10-23 16:06:53 How many had the Guts to keep Buying in October Investment stocks at good valuations?
.
Those which could hold at better valuation have dipped and moved up.
.
Ones that have remained are probably those where markets are revaluing on the dnside.
.
Are these the ones you will Buy?

1257 2018-10-23 16:05:45 If you are a short term investor in stocks, you are doing it wrong. Stocks are a good long term investment and ten years is the benchmark. 186% increase over ten years.
1258 2018-10-23 16:05:29 I’m kidding!  No levering the house up for stocks.

1271 2018-10-23 16:00:50 When you are in the 0.001% top income bracket, things like Brexit are just A Game.

Shartstains like this one WANT the economy to tank. It worked GREAT over here in the States in the 2008 crash.

Corporations & The Rich bought up stocks & property at fire sale prices, & laughed.

1279 2018-10-23 15:59:38 Not a pretty day for stocks. I'll discuss the latest October sell-off with @paulanewtonCNN coming up on @cnni at 12:06 ET.
1280 2018-10-23 15:59:18 Recent low on NASDAQ held and S&P tested without a selloff. The stocks that were hurt the most are bouncing back. All signs point to this being the retest before people start paying attention to positive earnings. Buy a little today. If no big swing up/down tomorrow, buy away.
1281 2018-10-23 15:59:09 there are a lot of companies like that. the early 80's was the start. they treat their bonds like stocks.  they are part of the 'enterprise value'. they would 'make money if they didn't have to pay the bond interest.'
1282 2018-10-23 15:59:00 This piece of shit, he’s clearly what’s wrong with our country. They need to charge these assholes more to short stocks, what a rigged game. China threw his corrupt ass in jail for doing what he does here every day. The only good thing they’ve done lately.
1283 2018-10-23 15:58:51 Good to see some stocks ignoring this market sell off. $amrn
1284 2018-10-23 15:58:12 True story Dad died in 2014 just prior to his death he cashed in the last of his retirement stocks There was one stock who's total shares valued at -$0.40 & no easy way to deal w/it so I still get statements It is now worth $1.20 Still not worth anything but quite a turnaround
1285 2018-10-23 15:58:11 Stocks trying desperately to hold 200 Dma look for plunge protection team to come in soon.  May try to hold up markets for us election?
1286 2018-10-23 15:58:05 If enough people dump @facebook stocks & stop using that platform, they’ll straighten up.
It’s been made MAGA compatible right now.
1287 2018-10-23 15:57:48 Only 3 Dow stocks higher right now. But all up due to earnings that were good. Imagine that. $MCD up nearly 6%. $VZ up about 4%. $UTX up 1%.
1288 2018-10-23 15:57:45 And how did you scan these stocks to play with ? Please enlighten
1289 2018-10-23 15:57:37 It’s no coincidence that stocks are spooked as @NateSilver538 gives 86% chance Dems take House. Economies generally fear socialist takeovers of government. #MidtermElections2018

1296 2018-10-23 15:56:18 This isn’t as much news anymore like it was in 2010. It’s disingenuous to talk about stocks rising and falling in points. Use percentages when discussing how much the Dow dropped
1297 2018-10-23 15:55:49 And no one is selling stocks because of the murder of a Saudi Arabian "journalist."
1298 2018-10-23 15:55:42 Your completely incorrect. Bump stocks are never used in the military and m16/4’s are used in the military not AR-15’s. Know your facts before you speak or don’t you care about facts?
1299 2018-10-23 15:55:27 i honestly thought the cryptocurrencies were a sign of the late cycle froth... i was wrong.   its pot stocks.

Well - if you wish to know - last September, too many investors preferred not to take my advice and go with some micro, small cap funds/stocks.
Same guys are back now requesting for advice.

1324 2018-10-23 15:49:12 Why stocks are (probably) actually falling: Worries about earnings season, tariff impact on Caterpillar, slower growth outlook, because more people want to sell than buy. And maybe other things.
1325 2018-10-23 15:49:05 No...stocks are falling because quarterly earning by two major companies are going to hit projections because costs of goods has gone up DUE TO TARIFFS! This is squarely on @realDonaldTrump 'policy'.
1326 2018-10-23 15:48:49 Stock market still isn’t doing well? Is it time for me to start shorting stocks like they did in The Big Short?

1328 2018-10-23 15:47:53 Haha, that's exactly the response I expected from the guy who brags about his stocks and is scared shitless of brown people. Well done.
1329 2018-10-23 15:47:48 At the end of the day, no matter how much stocks drop, they will always come back and make new highs.
1330 2018-10-23 15:47:46 Bit rich calling someone else a fool when you are the one who is quite evidently uninformed. Alefantis admitted in an interview that he stocks his canned tomatoes in the basement. You are being fooled. I advise looking into it a bit deeper.
1331 2018-10-23 15:47:41 Some moron killed Heather. Obama bailed out the banks, facts matter. Bump stocks will be banned via law very shortly, but that doesnt save lives. The 2013 bill was a complete disaster that legalized everyone and opened the border even more. Neither party cares about debt.
1332 2018-10-23 15:46:51 FIRE communities catch FIRE Brokers actually make more money on stocks losing ground.
1333 2018-10-23 15:46:41 Best thing to do is stay away from Markets. Only the biggest of the dogs earn there.

Unless you know someone who scams people by manipulating small stocks that is 

That then is a sure way to make money.
1334 2018-10-23 15:45:51 This is short-term stuff, but today's a good day to check which stocks are holding well above their low from two weeks back -- subtle sign of relative strength vs. the indexes.
1335 2018-10-23 15:45:41 To show the available stocks yet unpaid for...  marketing strategy
1336 2018-10-23 15:45:34 Keep an eye on $SMH and $XLF. They should show the way on a reversal. I still don't think we're there yet. It's good that bonds are finally catching a bid, but probably need them to run a bit more which means stocks going lower.

1359 2018-10-23 15:41:10 @jimcramer ‘s advise about being #patient & Not to #Panic/dump #stocks is perhaps applicable to #traders/#investors with long term staying power ... 2000+ drop on the @DowJones from its highs of 26952 is not ordinary ... #Business @CNBC

1361 2018-10-23 15:40:16 many stocks have already corrected far more than the indices & look washed out-my working premise for the overall market: is that we have a good rally sometime after the mid-terms through late November-expect plenty of volatility until then.

1365 2018-10-23 15:39:41 I started making a lot more money investing/trading stocks and commodities once I quit trying to predict the future and I started studying the present.
1366 2018-10-23 15:39:09 Despite all the damage, I still see specific stocks holding up well, maybe forming bases. Not buys with earnings upon us, but positive reactions could set that up. You never know $AMD $CYBR $DXCM $ENDP $NVCR $RAMP $REGI $SEAS

1370 2018-10-23 15:38:27 #Bear Markets do create a sense of panic and fear. And all those common sense that one had to wait for decent correction to enter the stocks, just evaporates.
1371 2018-10-23 15:38:06 Rates started the day much stronger as stocks were down over 550 points . Stocks have since rebounded and rates are worsening. Stocks should dictate the direction of rates this week.
1372 2018-10-23 15:37:55 So you want to make more money and dump the remaining stocks in another dumb investor’s head and run away before serious crisis unfolded in next 2-4 months .. many stocks have lost more than 50% of its value from all time high 
1373 2018-10-23 15:37:52 Stocks still gyrating but generally staying offered. It’s all looking very unclear where this leaves investor sentiment but it has certainly shifted now.

1382 2018-10-23 15:36:08 Peter. Bubble reflation in stocks or real estate in the very next cycle is totally unprecedented. It utterly failed in Japan.  Were you betting on that in 09-2010 ?

1484 2018-10-23 15:12:25 Agree. There should be way more hands-on and detailed learning about finances.  Like how stocks work, how to apply for a loan, the dif between a GIC, Savings and RSP, etc.
1485 2018-10-23 15:12:16 Excuse me. @CNBC. All this yapping about tech stocks...have you people looked at the energy space lately? $NFLX $AMZN $AAPL $SNAP $FB $CSCO et al cannot run without energy. @SquawkAlley

1487 2018-10-23 15:11:49 I did get our lab biolumenescent dinoflagelettes last Christmas and her response was- "Don't let them contaminate lab cultures and bacterial stocks"
1488 2018-10-23 15:10:15 Hey Uday, we would be having enough stocks to meet our fans requirements. Stay tuned to our sale of Realme phones tomorrow i.e 24th October 2018, 00:00 hrs exclusively on Flipkart as we can't ensure. Thanks
1489 2018-10-23 15:10:10 I hope the Trump supporters know that, even if they don't have stocks themselves, their pensions and 401Ks just lost out.  I hadn't checked yet this am an I just about had a stroke.
1490 2018-10-23 15:10:10 Lol...
...about the lottery, keep in mind that you can't lose if you don't play!!!  :)
...I'm hoping some of your other followers might weigh in.  Also, I don't short and don't do options.  Stocks on margin???  NONONONONO!!! (lol)
1491 2018-10-23 15:10:05 Should we buy ? (Have almost niglible cash ).
I heard in interview of Sir RJ on ET now. He said that we should wait till stocks stop falling one-way, it's OK to buy 10% higher than the bottom price...please share your views
1492 2018-10-23 15:10:04 Is there a gibbet involved?  Or just some stocks?
1493 2018-10-23 15:08:18 These stocks need to go up already 
1494 2018-10-23 15:08:15 Keep HODLING  ...or buy Tech Stocks.... maybe there you get a better profit!
1495 2018-10-23 15:07:35 Really wish I had more money to buy more stocks right now #fomo #buylowsellhigh
1496 2018-10-23 15:07:22 I’m sure it is. Institutional buyers along with corporations buying back stocks should make out like bandits, if that isn’t a redundancy for these two.
1497 2018-10-23 15:07:12 the stock market is moving down very quickly, and not a peep from Mr. Trump. sadly, the effect of his stupid tariffs is finally showing up as we knew it would...and stocks are in for a major continued slide downward

1499 2018-10-23 15:07:09 Bloody stocks
1500 2018-10-23 15:07:03 I believe it's too early to buy the dip on stocks.
1501 2018-10-23 15:07:03 @Varneyco So let me get this RIGHT .. Owners OF stocks ARE SELLING because they dont think the COMPANIES they OWN are NOT gonna make any more profits .. THAT DOESNT MAKE SENSE .. your cutting off your arm cuase your pissed at YOUR HAND .. what are TRYING to PULL .. Or dont you
1502 2018-10-23 15:06:41 Stocks 
1503 2018-10-23 15:06:38 @PressSec @realDonaldTrump  can we get a statement?  Stocks are lower on fears of a slowing economy. That means the great work Obama did is now being snuffed out by your lack of leadership.  Your rich friends will be calling. You are hurting them.
1504 2018-10-23 15:06:36 Was hoping for the pot stocks to fade down as $TLRY was down. Took a paper cut on $CRON $IGC & $NBEV just wouldn’t snap VWAP. Oh well come back tomorrow.
1505 2018-10-23 15:06:12 @cvpayne can you tweet your 30 stocks on your buy list?
1506 2018-10-23 15:06:02 there's not many stocks moving to trade so all the pumpers jump in on the same play and the early "smart" fundamentals based shorts get trapped.
1507 2018-10-23 15:05:50 Rising rates are bearish, so why are stocks going down today? JK... It was really never about rising rates, maybe velocity spooked some but at these levels, not really a problem imho- it's about China and leading growth indicators...
1508 2018-10-23 15:05:49 stocks are falling because we are in a bubble economy and bubbles burst.
1509 2018-10-23 15:05:33 The tRUMP. Policies taking effect after almost two years, hang on as we see interest rates soar, housing collapse, stocks crash!!!
1510 2018-10-23 15:05:24 Unlike recent selloffs, interest rates aren't the catalyst this time, with government bond yields easing lower. That's got homebuilder stocks rallying after a sector selloff Monday.  But the overall market is getting pummeled on trade worries, which hurt MMM and CAT guidance.
1511 2018-10-23 15:05:23 @sahneydeepak Sirji .. A few highly oversold stocks .. DishTV, Grasim and MindTree .. considering expiry this week ., are they good candidates for short covering? their RSI are in over sold territory.
1512 2018-10-23 15:05:09 Would have to see your stocks. I'm a small cap fan.
1513 2018-10-23 15:05:00 Cannabis stocks should be viewed in the long term. Before October, only Uruguay had legalized pot. After the midterm elections, more states will vote to legalize pot, November 1st UK legalizes medical. As the thaw continues, more opportunities are created.
1514 2018-10-23 15:04:27 @Varneyco CAT competes with its own global installed base. US stocks are priced for Lousy long term returns.
1515 2018-10-23 15:04:19 @Varneyco Agree that retirees or those close should maybe take some cash & park it or put into bonds. We've enjoyed great market gains, but maybe the time is now to protect your portfolio. Still stay in some safe stocks, as there will be good buying opportunities ahead, right?
1516 2018-10-23 15:04:16 Falling stocks depress U.S. dollar against other safe havens

1520 2018-10-23 15:03:48 A saw a lot of CT show interest in trading pot stocks with many long calls recently. Many of them are not only hype sell the news stuff, but this morning is also a good example of why trading against the market direction with high beta stocks is a poor decision. $SPY $CRON
1521 2018-10-23 15:03:33 Stocks are the better option unless you consider all the thousands many lost not too long ago. Playing the lottery and losing costs less money. I am not saying that one should do stocks. Stocks have risks and this article seems to try to say that stocks are safer which are not.
1522 2018-10-23 15:03:25 My predict $AMD up another$1 before ER that's tomorrow. Then down after trust me. Analysis estimate 10% down to all Tech stocks.
1523 2018-10-23 15:03:21 Thank you for telling us every day to buy dips. Profitless tech stocks and printing money. Fundamentals
1524 2018-10-23 15:03:15 You shouldn't own stocks if a 50% drop in their value in a short period of time would cause you acute distress. No one can tell you when these will happen. The light can at any time go from green to red without pausing at yellow. Temperament matters; not IQ.

1527 2018-10-23 15:02:04 Some of my stocks have been bearish all year so this is really just another day for bagholders anonymous. But the rest of you, welcome to the party.
1528 2018-10-23 15:01:55 Simple scenario: there are only 2 stocks. I sell you X and you sell me Y; Over next 20Y both grow earnings by 100X and we both hold 100 baggers. Win win not zero sum ;)
1529 2018-10-23 15:01:37 Global stocks slumped today today as worries about economic growth continue. S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq all fell by more than 1%.
1530 2018-10-23 15:01:21 I think the same thing—-Stocks are falling due to fear that Democrats will win midterms and end "pro-growth policies," according to White House advisor Larry Kudlow.
1531 2018-10-23 15:01:14 stocks are gonna get even uglier, this is setting up real bad
1532 2018-10-23 15:01:11 @larry_kudlow is wrong. It is @realDonaldTrump policies that are causing stocks to drop. Rising rates by Powell, Rep policies with the trade war etc. Obama lowers rates, markets were stable and doing well and no trade war.
1533 2018-10-23 15:01:01 Keen to hear thoughts on whether the growth stocks story ending? is that 10-yr bull run for growth over or just a pause? should investors be looking at value ?
1534 2018-10-23 15:00:51 During these 21 years trading penny stocks, I saw many incompetent CEOs. You are one of them, and, you are in the hall of fame. When I see what you are doing, I just see the image of a 5 years old boy driving a 500 HP Porsche..... against a wall.
1535 2018-10-23 15:00:50 What's happening to stocks this morning? An accumulation of negatives (including the ongoing macro problems of Italy, US-China trade, TSY yields, hawkish Fed policy, Saudi Arabia, etc., combined w/a fraying of the earnings firewall).
1536 2018-10-23 15:00:49 Another day stocks are selling off and no one bullish. A week makes a difference. Stay bullish Jim. As you know every week is different.
1537 2018-10-23 15:00:45 I'd save your excitement until after the midterms. You could be eating your words. If you were into stocks, you'd know everything is riding on upcoming elections. People want to sell because of the Democrats already claiming a "blue wave" so convincingly.

1541 2018-10-23 14:59:48 @larry_kudlow is wrong. It is @realDonaldTrump policies that are causing stocks to drop. Rising rates by Powell, Rep policies with the trade war etc. Obama lowers rates, markets were stable and doing well and no trade war.

1575 2018-10-23 14:48:20 i caught it but this is a bounce you should be selling into not trying to catch

stocks are going much lower and lower today, its a BS bounce
1576 2018-10-23 14:48:15 In my opinion if you REALLY wanted to make money in stocks you gotta have at least 10k and invest in start up companies. You gotta just research and make sure that they’ll be able to grow and be prosperous. Have y’all watched the show SharkTank?
1577 2018-10-23 14:48:15 @realDonaldTrump look at the sea of red in stocks, we're under 25k on the Dow. Negotiate the trade mess you created. It's all your fault this is happening. Democrats did place tariffs on everything, you did.

1588 2018-10-23 14:46:53 The second large spike was right after Kazakhstan announced a 10% production cut. Most U stocks increased about 20%. Upcoming IPO's should affect market positively, provided the bottom doesn't drop out in the overall market.

can easily drop a further 50% especially if leveraged sellers, better stocks out there...

1646 2018-10-23 14:34:52 Don't get me wrong about bullishness on stocks, if we get to D point, we could bounce but, limitated to the next resistance, then the fall will continue. Patterns are reliable and way underestimated, regardless they were studied and proved decades ago.
1647 2018-10-23 14:34:50 @Varneyco 
The real reason for the market downturn: The billion $ lottery has traders selling stocks and buying lotto tickets for their portfolios. 
1648 2018-10-23 14:34:40 Dow drops in early trading as two industrial giants warn of trouble. Share prices for 3M and Caterpillar fell dramatically after 3M cut its earning guidance and Caterpillar warned dealers worldwide that it would raise prices because of the growing cost of steel. #stocks
1649 2018-10-23 14:34:37 16.8% of S&P 500 stocks trading at 52-week lows.  Highest total since February 2016.
1650 2018-10-23 14:34:33 The point is exactly that. Either they pay the people=more savings in banks Disp Income, etc or they don't. They haven't!

1702 2018-10-23 14:22:02 ...as this market continues downward, all I can think of to do to protect what little y/y gains I have left is to keep buying stocks that have been on my buy list for a while. Unfortunately, that list is getting smaller.  Portfolio up about 15% on the year though.
1703 2018-10-23 14:21:54 Finally looks like we will get a washout day in #stocks. Would like to see S&P close under 2700 to show a bit of panic. Now is the time to look for bargains and I would start with names like $AMZN, $NVDA and emerging markets. Full disclosure: I am long some EMs and NVDA

1712 2018-10-23 14:20:35 @AP U.S. stocks slumped broadly in early trading Tuesday, sending the Dow Jones Industrial Average down more than 500 points and extending the market's recent string of losses.@NYSE
1713 2018-10-23 14:20:26 .. to continue on the subject. When your indicators sense the market corrections, it seems like you sell all your stocks including currently winning stocks. Once, market recovery is confirmed you consider buying them at new price. So, protect wins as much as losses.
1714 2018-10-23 14:20:02 but just like Doug kass, he always thinks he's right..Thats why both of them make their money from subscriptions to services not actually trading stocks

1722 2018-10-23 14:16:18 The stocks that are selling off are the Globalist companies. They even bring the stock market down to manipulate the American People.  I would not be surprised if they are shorting the market. The Rothschild, Soros, NWO do not care who gets hurt.

1735 2018-10-23 14:14:35 Hold on to your 401k....Dow down 400.  Look for the plunge protection team to dive in before closing bell to rescue the market.  If that doesn’t happen I think a coordinated effort to sink stocks before midterms is under way.  Tons of volatility with strong dollar hurting EM’s.

1743 2018-10-23 14:13:40 Actually it's pretty typical for the worst stocks to do well on big down days. They are more manipulated, tighter floats etc.
Also they have the dumbest investors so they might sell what's going down and buy more of what's doing well.

How would that change the world, financially speaking? Would it keep businesses smaller? Would that help average people or would they feel it?

1757 2018-10-23 14:10:09 I agree with the vaccine theory on hikes. The problem is they weren’t administered early or aggressively enough to stave off another “asset price mania.” Stocks, risky bonds, resi RE (again), CRE (again), baseball cards, high-end booze, artwork, you name it. All through the roof!
1758 2018-10-23 14:09:41 Why are your stocks tanking ???
1759 2018-10-23 14:09:24 No, shorters have moved on from Tesla and are targeting pot stocks. Shorting should be an earned title.

You’re just being led to the choices that the system wants you to make. They want you to pick stocks, bonds and mutual funds – the assets they’re selling you.
1767 2018-10-23 14:08:07 Do you honestly believe that the "founding fathers" ever envisioned AR-15s and bump stocks? I don't. I also believe that if they did even imagine what it would come to, the 2A would have been written very differently.

1782 2018-10-23 14:05:50 another way of putting it ...

much high inflation = much higher bond yields on new bonds
much higher bond yields = repricing of existing bonds & stocks AND higher operating expenses for debt-leveraged companies (that further erode the E in addition to lowering P/E ratio)

1856 2018-10-23 13:50:18 @shanta_gold is the company an oiler?  Down 10% when other GOLD stocks have been marked up..

would be good to see some director buying too..
1857 2018-10-23 13:50:17 Somewhere there has to be this headline:”Pot stocks lead Nasdaq lower.”
1858 2018-10-23 13:50:04 No, I don't time the market!!!  I simply buy when stocks meet my criteria and hold cash when few meet my criteria. As a result, I have "timed" the market well for three decades as a bi-product.
1859 2018-10-23 13:49:49 Market isn't "crashing." Industrial stocks (3M, Cat, etc.) down 5%-7% while other Dow stocks are up. China is slowing, which is plan to get them to lower tariffs, and slightly higher interest rates are causes. Not to worry. 
1860 2018-10-23 13:49:45 We are close to support on quite a few of stocks $SGMO $TGTX $CLVS
1861 2018-10-23 13:49:39 Don't expect the down move in stocks to last much longer, a clean out of the stops below Oct 11 lows/bear trap today. Expect the Dow to rebound by Friday from current price @ 24950
1862 2018-10-23 13:49:32 We will put up the chart but Paul Jones used an analog chart to predict the 1987 crash. That model showed a 92% correlation between the movement of stocks in the 1920s, and the movement of stocks in the 1980s. It also perfectly projected the 1987 crash.
1863 2018-10-23 13:49:30 All this is perking up the market. The company, which all year goes in a minus on real profit can't have it's stocks growing. Nothing new: @TRXC has always been known for its fueled rallies resulting in insider selling and consequent stock declines.
1864 2018-10-23 13:49:20 Good defensive stocks are green, topping?
1865 2018-10-23 13:49:13 Most of this year's hot growth stocks look like absolute trash now $SQ $ROKU $TWLO $ZEN etc
1866 2018-10-23 13:49:00 TRADE: bought SPY 272C EXP 10/24 at 1.61, I can sit on this one for a bit. #options #stocks #money #trading #income #wealth #sidehustle $UVXY $SVXY $SPXL $QQQ $SPX
1867 2018-10-23 13:48:31 Risk off as stocks fall
1868 2018-10-23 13:48:08 #SPY Correction in play okay now what? You play the bounce for now, this is healthy look for the best stocks to begin to move up, this of course puts them all on a whipsaw territory, here is when rules come in.
1869 2018-10-23 13:47:56 "Me too! I was delighted to find that the TARDIS stocks them though now I know it's you're doing," she says playfully as she drinks her own cocoa.
1870 2018-10-23 13:47:54 I swear I really believe that Trump manipulates the stock market in his favor in the gop's favor whenever he insults an American Business their stock drop therefore most likely he sells High and then insults the company then buys stocks again low just a thought
1871 2018-10-23 13:46:46 If you want extra income buy stocks lol
1872 2018-10-23 13:46:39 Maybe his team buying stocks for him

1874 2018-10-23 13:46:27 if 15-18%..lot to go on high growth stocks..could mean 40% lower,...guppy charts on weekly still intact
1875 2018-10-23 13:46:22 Will voters see how bad stocks have been over the past month or two and please attribute this to the uncertainty caused by Trump's policies?
1876 2018-10-23 13:46:17 Ta pas un contact partenaire fiable ? Genre je sais que les marques ont souvent un local de stockage pour leurs stocks, maybe tu peux essayer de t'arranger ?
1877 2018-10-23 13:46:12 CITRON is in this vicious cycle where they screw up more and more and therefore have to have opinions and take bigger and bigger swings on higher BETA stocks just to garner attention for marketing purposes. Doesn't mean they will be wrong about TSLA earnings reaction, but
1878 2018-10-23 13:45:56 Charles, is it time to dump traditional equity stocks and run towards gold/silver etf’s, better yet physical ownership of metals? How about cryptos?
1879 2018-10-23 13:45:34 @RobinhoodApp @AskRobinhood how can I transfer my stocks from my brokerage account to Robinhood?
1880 2018-10-23 13:45:24 Very glad you've made your $TSLA support so clear! What other stocks you like?
1881 2018-10-23 13:44:59 To paraphrase Lloyd Bridges from "Airplane!", it looks like it's the wrong time to list a pot stock.    Aurora Cannabis shares tumble 12% in first trades on the NYSE.  Cannabis stocks are down for the 6th session in a row.  Many hit record highs a week ago today.
1882 2018-10-23 13:44:43 I remember a stock market downturn in the US and Canada, that didn't cease until voting uncertainty ended. This could be similar. Good time to pick away, slowly. #stocks
1883 2018-10-23 13:44:42 Vicious price action in pot stocks. Never in my decades of trading seen such volatility daily as the bubble gets blown bigger then deflate just as fast then....
1884 2018-10-23 13:44:29 @AppleSupport why is it that my stocks aren’t synced across all of my devices using my iCloud account? Seems like an easy feature that would’ve been included across all devices with the adding of the app for iPad and Mac.
1885 2018-10-23 13:44:03 nah, let u in on a secret, unless ur in a creative agency, most designers compose new designs from pre-existings stocks.

makes it much more efficient to churn out illustration.. 

i simply reuse whatever we have in the company branding library...
1886 2018-10-23 13:44:00 Morgan Stanley upgraded #Petrobras/PBR to 'overweight': "we expect continued high volatility in the coming weeks, but now have more conviction that energy policy will remain healthy into 2019; fundamental upside is attractive". New PT of $21.5/ADR #stocks #Brazil
1887 2018-10-23 13:43:46 stocks rise by 1%.
1888 2018-10-23 13:43:26 WE’RE SEEING A MAJOR SECTOR ROTATION FROM STOCKS TO MEGA MILLIONS LOTTERY TICKETS TODAY. BUCKLE UP!
1889 2018-10-23 13:43:24 Utah: “it’s no secret, Utah needs a break up. Stop the Opioid epidemic” 

Also Utah: Denies access to alternative, safer medicine unless it goes through the pharmacy so the Mormon church can keep their pharma stocks and believe everything sky grandpa “tells” them #ThatsTheTea
1890 2018-10-23 13:43:22 Yesterday stocks started the day high and then came back to earth. Today we are starting low...
1891 2018-10-23 13:43:18 Stocks go down, bonds go up. Not sure that this is it for stocks just yet (2600 key), it could be. But this all just reinforces my view to be long USTs when stocks do crash. #TLT
1892 2018-10-23 13:42:28 my mental stability decreasing rapidly similar to my weed stocks

1896 2018-10-23 13:41:22 Pot stocks bouncing off of lows set at open...….going lower or at least a bounce then see what happens.
1897 2018-10-23 13:41:22 chemical stocks such as $EMN
1898 2018-10-23 13:41:20 As the stock market is crashing today, remember that makes it a good time to buy stocks.

1900 2018-10-23 13:40:46 The subject "Freedom/privacy" and "Crypto/Blockchain" meet there. One is the problem and the other is the solution. The questions are: Who keeps and uses the data stocks. Who sets legislation that regulates conservation and use ?

1907 2018-10-23 13:39:38 @cvpayne ....Is investor fear factor increasing to point where we may be seeing a ST bottom? Are projected revenues poor in Q3 results so far? Are funds dumping stocks w/China exposure over Trade War? Questions , questions!
1908 2018-10-23 13:39:35 Great time to add some China stocks as the levels are amazing right now 
1909 2018-10-23 13:39:23 Stocks are on sale
1910 2018-10-23 13:39:20 What are the odds $SPY will fill the gap at the close? $SPX #Stocks #Markets
1911 2018-10-23 13:39:08 Stocks tumbling because of trump’s lies, deception, chaos inability to deal with world leaders and economy without paying the millionaires!!
1912 2018-10-23 13:38:53 #US stocks come out the traps in the red: S&P -42 pointsDow -431Nasdaq -141Things have improved a touch since those opening numbers but it's going to take a lot to turn this sentiment around.
1913 2018-10-23 13:38:31 Media!  When talking about the Market crash.  Please get your markets and companies right.  Most of the TECH STOCKS are not on the DJI they still sit on the "OTC" or NASDAQ now...  TEACH CORRECT INFO....
1914 2018-10-23 13:38:25 The stock market will make u cringe right now. One of my stocks is down 36% this week 
1915 2018-10-23 13:38:23 Gold etf up, everything down in stocks. What does that tell you?
1916 2018-10-23 13:38:02 As expected, Stocks plunge at the open. Dow -422 points.
1917 2018-10-23 13:37:58 Yeah but you want to maximize your profits. Sometimes its best to just hold but to me tesla is like clockwork, easier than other stocks to foresee movements
1918 2018-10-23 13:37:57 Bank stocks getting hammered the past few weeks. WSJ put out a good article on depositors moving their money out of banks and into interest accounts. Sucking up bank capital.
1919 2018-10-23 13:37:52 And...here we go:

"U.S. equity futures took a nosedive in early trading Tuesday, following a rout in global stocks."

Is this what winning looks like, @realDonaldTrump?
1920 2018-10-23 13:37:37 Who dragged my Sensex down?

IT, pharma, energy, bank and FMCG stocks were the top casualties of Tuesday's selloff. Infosys, TCS, Sun Pharma, Reliance Industries, Asian Paints, SBI, HUL and ITC emerged as the top drag on Sensex, in that order.
1921 2018-10-23 13:37:23 Some would say start a small position and average in. Nobody knows where the bottom is going to be. I think the biggest risk is a longer period of slow to no growth, which won't be good for tech. Might get more from boring old value stocks. I'm buying a little of each but slowly.
1922 2018-10-23 13:37:21 To @realDonaldTeump
HEY WAKE UP!! THE STOCKS MARKET IS DROPPING LIKE A BOULDER!!!
IT'S MAINLY BECAUSE OF YOUR TARIFFS!!

1927 2018-10-23 13:35:57 Weak/slow markets continue. Cad pot stocks down big time again but lots of down or sideways trading. Alright, back to quiet buying. May get back on this later, GL. Don't panic or lose your hat, good things always come back up!

1929 2018-10-23 13:35:36 Corporate buy backs have slowed which was keeping stocks overvalued. The sugar high is over.
1930 2018-10-23 13:35:26 Poor earnings report. Stocks sharply lower.
1931 2018-10-23 13:35:22 Stocks getting CRUSHED
1932 2018-10-23 13:35:16 It’s why I’m long on Tesla. I can’t even begin to guess on the stocks short term moves
1933 2018-10-23 13:35:14 Stocks have fallen back to the 2015/16 levels.  The gop corporate tax cut was horrific and is bankrupting this nation.
1934 2018-10-23 13:34:57 I GET IT NOW! That's why this stupid fuss over "anti-vaxxers" is still going on after all this time. Big Pharma is desperate to distract people from all the antibiotic resistant "super bugs" building up, and the polio-like thing going around. Keeps stocks from dropping.
1935 2018-10-23 13:34:39 WE’RE SEEING A MAJOR SECTOR ROTATION FROM STOCKS TO MEGA MILLIONS LOTTERY TICKETS TODAY. BUCKLE UP!

A: setting aside “X” # of years of future income in bonds is fine to determine AA (say 60/40), but only wanna spend them when stocks are DOWN. When stocks are UP, spend the capital gains! It’s also a way to rebalance

1986 2018-10-23 13:21:22 Also. The new fad of shorting by mass retail investors + the huge surge in L/S money means that there are many more heavily over crowded low float stocks (and many people who don’t know how they trade in a correction).

2014 2018-10-23 13:14:10 $ES_F nasty open. As I've been saying in the Videos, $VIX $25-$26 retest is likely in the card based on recent, past patterns. The key for Stocks early is if the opening low is higher or lower than the ON & sustains. Bulls need to get above & stay above the opening 15 min high.

2024 2018-10-23 13:11:21 This stock market had the selloff coming for it TBH.  Never a good sign when your 52 week low list is filled with deep cyclical stocks.  Industrial, autos, housing, that's all that was on that list
2025 2018-10-23 13:11:03 Stocks are up about 0.8% this year, which is not very #maga. If you’ve really been in real estate for 30 years, you’d know that the housing market has improved every year since 09. Trump has done some good things, but let’s not give him credit where it isn’t due.
2026 2018-10-23 13:10:40 “We don’t think the correction is done yet. We think attempts to rebound were more short lived than sustainable” Morgan Stanley. Do you see the word correction? When stocks P/E are sky high they are overpriced - sometimes. If their earnings are strong, they could have a high P/E.

2057 2018-10-23 13:01:25 And the Trump effect is called a bubble. That’s also how the stock market works. A lot of the effect is companies who got a massive tax break buying back stocks which artificially inflates its value.

2106 2018-10-23 12:48:14 Caterpillar and 3M Stocks plunge, sending the Dow tumbling in pre-market trading.

Caterpillar blames Trump's tariffs for rising supply costs, equating to lower earnings expectations.

2109 2018-10-23 12:46:20 You might not need to do anything with your investments. Depending on how your portfolio is structured.
Corrections are normal and may provide opportunities for buying good stocks that are over-valued now.
The Trump market is just a big bubble that is bound to burst.
Don't panic.
2110 2018-10-23 12:45:57 Don’t get distracted. You should remember Obama lowered interest rates, improved stocks, economy and the mess left by Rep. @realDonaldTrump raised interest rates, and now decimating stocks and your 401k, and we are headed to a recession and market crash. Vote nov 6.

2114 2018-10-23 12:45:12 #Futures has taken  a nosedive in early trading Tues, following a rout in global stocks.
Dow (^DJI) futures slid 1.62%, or 410 points, as of 7:58 a.m. ET, as major manufacturers Caterpillar&3M posted disappointing financial results. Futures for  S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell 1.49%, or 41%

2129 2018-10-23 12:42:09 Be careful with having an opinion on which way the market will go without looking at hard clear data. The data is suggesting a major correction. (more stocks making lows, global markets all red on the year, etc, etc, etc). Doesn't mean a sell off will occur, but data suggests.

2133 2018-10-23 12:40:21 I did save a lot of money. But where I went wrong was in trusting that Merrill Lynch knew what they were doing. I wouldn't trust these guys either.Always remember that in an up market anyone can pick stocks.But when things turn...………..
2134 2018-10-23 12:39:26 Increased #volatility - which may be happening - is always interesting (and dangerous) as it tests the flimsy validity of financial models based supposedly on 'cast-iron' correlations. Once these imaginary correlations are exposed for what they are chaos ensues. #stocks #markets
2135 2018-10-23 12:38:52 But with gains early comes a reversion to the mean. 20% one year implies 0% the next if you assume 10% returns on stocks.
2136 2018-10-23 12:38:51 "What ratings did you have on these stocks, heading into this?"

"We've had BUYS on 3M and on Caterpillar."

2156 2018-10-23 12:30:49 I don't buy the narrative about the Eu decimating fishing. The CFP was put in place to manage fish stocks, provide a fair playing field for all fishers, to prevent cod wars etc.. It's far from perfect but it is being reformed. Demise of fishing towns due to many other factors.

2173 2018-10-23 12:26:17 Stocks should (ideally) be a long term investment. Meaning if the market starts going down like it has been lately there is no need to freak out. It just means that it’s time to buy if you have the $$ to invest! It’s all a game that we play everyday

2477 2018-10-23 09:46:00 TECHNOLOGY ALWAYS FALLS THE LAST ,IT HAPPNED IN 2008.ITS HAPPENING NOW.THIS HAS BEEN STEEP VALUTION FALL.WHAT R STOCKS THAT HAVE LEAST CORRECTED.THEY R ONES WHERE VALUTION R GOOD,SIMPLE
2478 2018-10-23 09:44:52 きょうの日経平均はザラ場安値が21,993円、終値は22,000円を辛うじて守るも安値引け。先物は現時点で21,800円台。

テクニカルでは、月足24MAの21,000円まで下落の展開を考慮すべき段階。これが実現すると、日足も週足もデッドクロス確実。上昇相場の終焉を意識しショート積み増しが必要か。

2483 2018-10-23 09:43:01 Any other stocks on top of your hit just other than SLB? They're are so many good deals out there.
2484 2018-10-23 09:42:47 Oldshool argument... Other markets like stocks and gold much more manipulated in bigger time frames. Lower highs in btc btw since Februar and very easy to analyse technical. And wait, @digitalassetbuy talked about repeating patterns in one of his last videos... ;-)

2486 2018-10-23 09:42:09 Always recall, in 2001 a building soc (after rejecting my mortgage application) advised me to invest in stocks rather than buy my London flat. Luckily, I ignored and got a mortgage elsewhere.
2487 2018-10-23 09:41:51 Just yesterday my GP said they had no idea when stocks would be available. Could you do something useful and find out why there are no stocks?
2488 2018-10-23 09:40:52 This is some bullshit Ken lad. Can’t take this market sell down seriously if it’s so concentrated in stocks.
2489 2018-10-23 09:40:44 I have invested in Large cap share such as Infosys and Reliance but i am confused that should i continue with the same or remove one and convert to mid-cap stocks. #AskReligareOnMarkets #ReligareBroking

2495 2018-10-23 09:39:20 Very well put by @pankaj_murarka : One of the worst mistake a long term investor can do is to let a crisis situation go waste. (as in not buying quality stocks during crisis)

They try so hard to show the positives sometimes...
2501 2018-10-23 09:37:18 Not yet. Smallpox was eradicated from nature in 1980, and known stocks of the virus are located at WHO –supervised repositories in the US and Russia but a Canadian scientist made it in the lab synthetically. So still a threat.

2502 2018-10-23 09:35:15 If you don't have money this phase we are entering is going to be very painful. Parallel marketers were buying all the stocks then selling at a premium the other things in the basket will guarantee no profits for them and allow shops to serve more people.
2503 2018-10-23 09:35:10 Wenn man die Spitze eines dünnen Stocks über deine Wasseroberfläche zieht, entstehen ähnliche Strukturen. Ich vermute mal, diesen Wolkenstrukturen liegt die gleiche Physik zu Grunde – nur etwas größer.

2507 2018-10-23 09:32:50 $XBI is 2SD below the 200D. Last time was late Feb 2016. Component stocks above 200D at 17% so a bit divegent tbh.
2508 2018-10-23 09:32:45 I always get strong feeling Kamran Khan is stocks player.  All good when index is high and deeply concerned about 'market' when it's low, and doesn't bother to check what he speaks/writes.....proven time and again! #yellowjournalism
2509 2018-10-23 09:32:39 I know yesterday had lots of you seeing red. Look at the big picture the year isnt over. Some stocks hit my buy levels and some still have room to fall.

2512 2018-10-23 09:31:22 Dow Jones fell like crazy, China's stocks on its knees, Nikkei fell & tripped, and KLSE lost almost 100 points in just several weeks. That's it...bye2

2514 2018-10-23 09:30:52 completely agree, stocks which have posted really strong numbers and the kind market reaction shows the kind of fear prevailing in the market. high quality high beta beaten down names fallen below mean valuations will be first in line to recover.

2537 2018-10-23 09:11:39 The only thing that could remotely save the official end of the ten year bull market in stocks is a worldwide concerted effort towards a new coordinated QE. Have a nice day!

2553 2018-10-23 08:57:09 As you wear a shirt, the constant friction of your body scrapes miniscule amounts of fibers, which join up with your skin shedding and tries to fall down. As it falls though it finds a "natural" cavity and stocks in there.

2556 2018-10-23 08:53:52 Guess what, even with your Tory Hard Brexit, there will still need to be management of fish stocks, for sustainability. Fish are not British. They do not carry #bluepassports.
2557 2018-10-23 08:53:21 Bears seem to be tiring out... 
Bulls will only liquidate if NIFTY starts trading below 10080 - 10040 range is breached. Many quality stocks are very near to their long term support areas.

Avoid leverage. Maintain & Execute Stoplosses. No Capital, No Capital Markets.

2560 2018-10-23 08:51:58 The valuations in metal sector stocks are still rich. Markets expect growth and regulatory environment to outpace even the current higher base. That's too much to ask for
2561 2018-10-23 08:51:51 Nifty Mgmt is so easy by operators by controlling couple of stocks. Doesn't make sense to look at Nifty to gauge the broader market. Give markets a couple of months for macro feedback to take place & udayan will come right on top.

2565 2018-10-23 08:49:27 I know that some consider the hold-strategy as "dumb" because you could sell now and buy again when stocks are cheaper, but I see a great risk to have a bad timing. That's just the reason. If you are willing to put time and effort into it you can have great profits though!
2566 2018-10-23 08:48:58 Vanadium’s rise has been extraordinary & the stocks while having small runs haven’t fully re-rated on the back of the vanadium rise & long term supply issues. The penny will drop & vandium stocks will have a major re-rate moment  $AVL $SRN
2567 2018-10-23 08:48:33 supreme court should declare selling stocks as illegal ;P
2568 2018-10-23 08:45:45 In these markets, it becomes easy to identify stocks that are being rigged. If an NBFC has large construction finance exposure, where even the rating agency red flags the ALM mismatch and yet stock barely falls in this crash then safe to assume that there are other forces at work
2569 2018-10-23 08:45:23 He’d charge them for that, too. This is the man who suggested ordinary people world not be ‘badly affected’ by #Brexit - as during the ‘rocky start’, they could ‘live off their stocks, shares, bonds, employment expenses or of course, their savings’. What an out of touch fool.
2570 2018-10-23 08:45:23 Pour out tha ass and I don’t pay for pussy I buy stocks in K2 spice out a milk carton in my dreams.
2571 2018-10-23 08:45:17 However, I suggest that selling stocks or ETFs should be considered carefully, as it is hard to have the best timing and, unless the company itself has long-term struggles, they will recover mid- to long term.
2572 2018-10-23 08:45:07 Raising money for private investments (without a track record) is difficult. Adding the token is another complication vs. stocks.

Adoption should get exponential once the investor liquidity benefits become clear. 

Without liquidity, the token is unnecessary for a great sponsor.
2573 2018-10-23 08:43:02 Once again, the FTSE 100 is back below its end-1999 level. A warning for those who assume, particularly with regard to pension funds, that stocks always perform well in the long run
2574 2018-10-23 08:42:34 ....that's who he is, a nasty, cruel, divisive, nationalist, con man without mensch....by the way 401K & stocks works because of globalist ask CEOs, Corps, and yes GOP donors...you have a failing example of nationalist that's happening called Brexit..

2591 2018-10-23 08:32:15 I also think the problem with capitalism is that it increases inequality. The US asset prices are going up with Trump but income is stagnant. So those guys with stocks and bonds are getting richer but not so much their middle class

2640 2018-10-23 07:58:29 But they've been rising for three years. I think real rates has something to do with it. There are knock on effects, but the fall began almost to the day the #fed began unwinding the BS last year. And that was Yellen. He tied himself to stocks. That's always fatal.

2643 2018-10-23 07:56:02 I agree that it misses the boat at times. But I personally don't think the market is wrong about stocks like AMZN, NFLX, AAPL or some of my favorites like PANW, ANET or PSTG.
2644 2018-10-23 07:55:54 Indian equity continued their downtrend for the third-straight session yesterday with the benchmark Sensex sliding over 181 points due to fag-end selling mainly in financial and energy sector stocks. #IndianEquity #Sensex #IACCAlert

2647 2018-10-23 07:53:15 The Fed raising rates certainly has caused this reaction in stocks.

2655 2018-10-23 07:46:54 That's all fine and good. Again, I think that stocks like AMZN perform the way they do, not because of cult followings, but because the market "gets it." AMZN is not overvalued in my opinion. You may disagree. I also do not think TSLA is overvalued.
2656 2018-10-23 07:46:45 Since gold is not an 'investment' you won't find many recommendations from investors to buy gold instead of stocks and bonds.

2957 2018-10-23 03:48:45 Homes are prohibitively unaffordable and rents are increasingly unaffordable...  I am perplexed that anyone would advocate others to  "buy home rental stocks".  That seems like the worst thing to do if home prices fall and rents follow.

3001 2018-10-23 03:13:50 The huge corporate tax cut has not trickled down as promised. Sure, some people got a bonus, others a small raise, but a large amount of tax savings went to stock buybacks that pushed stocks higher.  The middle class needs to pay their bills not play the Market.
3002 2018-10-23 03:13:49 No! Long-term investors need real growth, often more than expected.  Stocks are a better for the majority of most investor’s allocations. We’ve got 50 year periods where bonds trailed inflation. No that’s risk! Sure they help in bear markets, but those don’t last very long.

3066 2018-10-23 02:14:34 Stocks fell in Japan, Australia and South Korea. Futures in China and  Hong Kong were lower, suggesting the biggest jump in more two years in  the Chinese equities Monday may not extend.
3067 2018-10-23 02:13:57 Returns from 2000 to 2013 were zero in nominal, negative in real terms.

Buying Treasury bonds in 2000 and holding them for 20 years is STILL crushing stocks to this day.

Bad returns happen when stocks are expensive. Do with that whatever you will.

3070 2018-10-23 02:13:08 #ChicagoTonight #IL6 @PeterRoskam had nothing to do with Illinois banning bump stocks it was done at the state level. The state senate voted on  @KuameRaul's plan on April 28 and it passed 38-10 thank your state senators. @BruceRauner signed it into law in June.
3071 2018-10-23 02:12:33 When stocks down, anxiety can really do something
3072 2018-10-23 02:11:05 Stocks are up? Lol! Seriously? Where do you get that? We are in the longest corrections period in decades. The Dow alone is down almost 4% this month alone.  The ONLY thing that is keeping it within a thousand of Obama's trendline are high corporate earnings reports
3073 2018-10-23 02:09:54 Lol!! I really doubt your 401k is up unless you ate invested solely in about 5 stocks, taxcur scam was so bad they are running from it as fast as they can because trillion dollar deficits mean you get multiple tax increases over the next ten years, gas is going to get a lot worse

3085 2018-10-23 02:00:17 Ick investing means taking a special analytical interest in stocks that inspire a first reaction of 'ick.'  I tend to become interested in stocks that by their very names or circumstances inspire an unwillingness on the part of most investors to delve any further. - Michael Burry
3086 2018-10-23 01:59:25 Well, what I meant is that, for example, with stocks or, even better, with bonds one's investments are much safer. And, if the price of #btc will be stable at around "max" level, or just some very huge level held for a long time, there will be much less possibility to loose money
3087 2018-10-23 01:59:08 Been dipping into a little bit of stocks lately. Here are some plays I'm interested in. Check thread.

 $ACST $NETE $DCIX $NFLX $TOPS
3088 2018-10-23 01:58:53  that is his strategy and the stocks going to pop through $300. I just closed out my short position and I will be going back in, but I’m not sure at what level. I missed the $385 window, but I think the clown will be able to squeeze $325; for it to triumphantly go to $50ish.
3089 2018-10-23 01:57:15 Monday’s rout erased nearly $10 billion in market value from the 62 stocks in the Solactive North American Marijuana Index, the basis for the Horizons ETF, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence-- The Globe and Mail
3090 2018-10-23 01:55:59 No no, I’m not talking stocks. I’m talking about the car itself.
3091 2018-10-23 01:55:52 I don’t know what his sub services were offering, but when I was following him, it was just about process and individual stocks crossing MA’s.  I can’t speak to “current state”
3092 2018-10-23 01:54:34 When Stock Put is long and Call is shorted 95% chances price will go down and when stock call is long and Put is shorted means stock will go up. So this kind of position maintaining by FII from last 1 month so nifty stocks are going down.
3093 2018-10-23 01:52:48 Portfolio managers want to hug their benchmark in general, this sell off gives them a reason to buy cannabis stocks they previously didn’t own without looking dumb (buying at the highs)
3094 2018-10-23 01:51:24 I think the stocks might be better.

3100 2018-10-23 01:46:23 Stocks before 2000 were similar to what we have now, and dotcoms only added more fuel. But correction was inevitable even without them.
But #bitcoin now is very different – it doesn't serve as a fiat pump to hold stock markets, yet at least it is intended to hedge against them.

3105 2018-10-23 01:42:11 $SPX is on 2day's close only 6.3% fr the ATH tick. It's amazing how far off their respective highs so many groups & individual stocks r already.

3116 2018-10-23 01:37:53 . of stories by these problems...but they wouldn’t get tough with the customary display of the Trump from Michigan. If China has my Administration legalized bump stocks. BAD for not very dangerous. Be safe!
3117 2018-10-23 01:37:18 Bitcoin doesn't need to prove itself. It already has. From $0.05 to $6,000+ today. How many national currencies or stocks can say the same?

3161 2018-10-23 00:55:39 You can’t argue the economy is bad when the stocks are at all time highs, GDP is doing great and unemployment is low. Also jobs in every sector have increased.

3182 2018-10-23 00:36:36 I think this is why they say shorting stocks is harder ing a bear market than longing stocks in a bull market.
3183 2018-10-23 00:35:08 Agree. I think the general rebuttal to that is:
but Institutional investors
but Increased Awareness/Adoption
but Crypto moves 10x speed of stocks 
but Fiat crashing Need store of value

Sure, all creditable, but will that be enough?

3194 2018-10-23 00:30:41 Wtf I wrong with guy? Totally ignoring all the scary indicators to paint a rosy picture for stocks... WTF!
3195 2018-10-23 00:30:04 I'm convinced there is no such thing as a value trap in value investing just bad evaluations. You only get trapped when you lean too much on quantitative analysis without balancing it equally with qualitative analysis. #invest #stocks #investing #Money #Finance #Economics #Market

3199 2018-10-23 00:28:03 Yup. The single most important decision is the [Investment(Bond:Stock) ::Trading(Stocks:Options] allocation dynamic.

If you trade, which clearly you do.

After, that it's a piece of pie! Easy as cake! Oops. I got that wrong...

3201 2018-10-23 00:26:20 has the GOP administration banned bump stocks yet Manuel???    rather a no-brainer don't you think?
3202 2018-10-23 00:26:17 US markets were lower as energy stocks sank more than 1% on a pessimistic outlook for yr end whilst 10yr yields held around 3.2%. @realDonaldTrump has outlined requirements for waivers on Iran sanctions, supporting the oil price. Gold was lower following the strength in the #USD
3203 2018-10-23 00:26:07 Destabilizing The Central Bank (bad idea)they fund military, state bailouts, business bailouts,Student Loans, financial Aid,public welfair systems.Every time states, big business, and stocks screw up (all the time)the fed steps in

3207 2018-10-23 00:24:43 @ElectLong I HOPE you are not supporting "culling" sea lions to address salmon stocks.  I voted for you/against JHB for this reason... I hope I won't be sorry.  There has to be an intelligent and humane way to support salmon stocks.
3208 2018-10-23 00:24:27 Reminds of Cantor and his discovery of different orders of infinity. And given housing seems to be more stable than stocks over time, divergence from that stability seems a more obvious sign of a bubble... the problem is knowing when it will crash.

3212 2018-10-23 00:20:16 $TTWO It is what I think it is, and I'm not letting it off the hook! But dam this hurts right now.  So many video game stocks are sick...rarely have I seen this. Any young people out there looking to invest in what you know and love...this is the time to get started. #RDR2
3213 2018-10-23 00:19:54 Falta sobre Stocks. Tiene libres Goes con el primer cuarto expirado. La revisaron los jueces y el misionero puede sacar ventaja. #LSBxBT
3214 2018-10-23 00:19:21 No idea, I just was trolling around in garbage stocks (as one does) and spotted this today.
3215 2018-10-23 00:18:11 When stocks crash gold and silver usually crash along with them, then recover more quickly as people see them as a safe haven protected from inflation and global monetary policy. 

Could really see that happening to crypto. Crash at first, bottom faster
3216 2018-10-23 00:17:58 Charlie, lives on Lawn Canyon with their beloved skink.

Put all their savings into habanero stocks. Can't retire.
3217 2018-10-23 00:17:57 ignis: if you’re trying to get his goat, you should know he only stocks the animal in the first place for ironic purposes
3218 2018-10-23 00:17:49 I don't owe you an explanation because you're toxic af, but I was referencing tech stocks in '94 and '95 and the FANG stocks in 2000 dot com crash. 

I just misspoke. 

It was a rapid fire interview where he was jumping from person to person with less than 30 seconds to answer.
3219 2018-10-23 00:17:00 Agree .. Stocks on the brink of collapsing wont help the bull case either.
3220 2018-10-23 00:16:07 @samsamkharaz sälj om du har tesla stocks
3221 2018-10-23 00:16:04 ACCOUNT ABOUT STOCKS and INVESTMENTS;  I set up an account "Thomas Kaine on Stocks" @kaine_on   for anyone interested in sharing stock and investment news and opinions...I was putting a lot of stock info here & I was boring a lot of my followers...so I will do fewer tweets here
3222 2018-10-23 00:16:01 owe akamara several boxes of airheads hope Amazon stocks his fav flavors
3223 2018-10-23 00:15:07 Ask billionaire @SenFeinstein her husband is a billionaire...I highly doubt she has worried about anything in her entire adult life..except which stocks she and her husband are buying ..We're here cuz Establishment  Democrats are sell outs as well.
3224 2018-10-23 00:15:04 I think my biggest accomplishment in Smash 4 was taking 6 stocks in a college crew battle.  I could have taken more if I didn't botch my recovery in the last match, but I was pretty happy with how well I did.
3225 2018-10-23 00:14:09 The majority of pot stocks are overvalued. I’d wait until these things wash out all the hangers on.
3226 2018-10-23 00:13:54 Tesla stocks fall after elon starts tweeting about monogatari
3227 2018-10-23 00:13:32 Strange how the video game stocks under-performed today.
3228 2018-10-23 00:11:49 Difference between good franchises and laughing stocks. Patriots get gordon for a 5th and then the cowboys get desperate and trade a 1st for cooper.. not a 6-0 team, but a 3-4 team with a terrible qb and missing the playoffs.
3229 2018-10-23 00:11:41 Mixed day for stocks. Most tech pushed higher. Bad day for pot stocks. More selling turning the green to red. Good opportunities in the markets going into lots of earnings reports.
3230 2018-10-23 00:11:00 My nigga y tf do i keep getting stale candy yall needa replace your stocks dam

3233 2018-10-23 00:08:47 They all seem like nice people, but I can't see following their advice and making money.     Tonight's talk on pot stocks was a joke, just the same script as crypto 4 months ago.
3234 2018-10-23 00:08:05 Guess who has stocks In healthcare? Start with Ryan and keep on going.
3235 2018-10-23 00:07:22 Going to buy Tesla stocks for my son and give them to him as a gift when he turns 18.
3236 2018-10-23 00:06:03 Asia stocks begin negative following the lacklustre lead from Wall St where most majors finished in the red as financials underperformed and the S&P 500 posted a 4th consecutive loss; ASX 200 (-0.5%), Nikkei 225 (-1.2%), KOSPI (-0.7%)
3237 2018-10-23 00:05:51 For stocks, not for crypto
3238 2018-10-23 00:03:51 #Stocks nice day we had with the $TRIN above 1.00 all day to help better #daytrade the $SPY $SPX options. as well we had the $TICK hit high numbers several times +/- 1000 and higher
3239 2018-10-23 00:03:44 tbh it seems more like he's trying to plummet the stocks on purpose at this point lol
