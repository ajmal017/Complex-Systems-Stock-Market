To assume that another 20-30% drop in stocks or even 1-2% drop in GDP  is going to force China to capitulate is naive

3 2018-11-29 23:56:43 Bump stocks are not necessary for bump fire; it can be replaced by pant belt loops or by changing the shooters stance and grip. You could also make one for <$5. Pointless law. More infringement. Capitulates to gun grabbers.

11 2018-11-29 23:47:08 I would be very surprised if its racist. I can't hear any racist talk. If everyone calms down a bit you'd find the big kid is just an arsehole bully. Every school has a couple and if the small kid had been white it would have been ignored. Bring back the cane stocks
12 2018-11-29 23:46:02 Why throw that word around so liberally? Why must stocks "crash"? Why can't rates rise "moderately as not to choke off credit demand too quickly"? Market is 95% algos. Find a new talking a point.

15 2018-11-29 23:45:14 Who really gives a damn. Bump stocks are a novelty. I can't recall ever firing my M16A1 fully auto when I was in Marine Infantry (0311). Too inaccurate and bump stock is even more inaccurate. BRASS. Breathe, relax, aim, sight and squeeze.

32 2018-11-29 23:44:33 So ppl are buying more stocks, making and spending more $, buying more houses, unemployment rates way down and your claiming none of it’s due to tax cuts? Tell me where it’s coming from then
33 2018-11-29 23:44:24 Check y'all stocks it's looking good
34 2018-11-29 23:44:20 Stocks close slightly slower, trimming earlier losses
35 2018-11-29 23:44:13 Agreed. It seems that every time bad news comes out on the #US #Housing market, it is completely ignored or stocks in the group actually rally.

Something is amiss. But the trend does not lie, and the trend is pointing  down. #BusinessNews #WallSt #Stocks #bearish
36 2018-11-29 23:43:52 @WilfredFrost    Can you guys please explain how stocks or bonds can omnisciently figure out what the economy is doing before the claims data shows it? How does that work?
37 2018-11-29 23:43:39 good news, good start. what purpose is there to dispose of the bump stocks rather than turning in? how to enforce.
38 2018-11-29 23:43:26 Has less to do w/ time then mental capital. Over the yrs I've developed a very specific setup that I will trade. (Explained in detail to Marti a few wks ago) Anything that doesn't have those characteristics is cast aside. Also, I mostly do not trade stocks under $10 any longer.
39 2018-11-29 23:43:18 Lmao ima just go back to stocks  jk
40 2018-11-29 23:42:59 A falling dollar would probably be good news for Trump. Stocks would go up and he'd claim responsibility for a lot of nominal growth (despite poor real returns).
41 2018-11-29 23:42:57 OMG to all the economists who know about these guys - they could not have been more WRONG in the past about everything they said.  In the economics world these two are laughing stocks!
42 2018-11-29 23:42:22 Just between CRSP and EDIT gene editing stocks are up almost $200M vs biotech since the news broke. Everyone who stands to profit from it is hoping we all quietly move on, pretend it never happened, and let the ethical lines slip.
43 2018-11-29 23:42:13 Please. Dont stop investing in your skillsets and your business. 

But it may be smart to learn about crypto and stocks before 100k because if you use proper risk management you’ll get there much faster
44 2018-11-29 23:41:40 Things in common:

46 2018-11-29 23:40:46 EU quotas and conservation policy has ensured a growth in fish stocks for everyone.
47 2018-11-29 23:40:43 I know he's lost a lot of votes where I live because he's banned bump-stocks.
48 2018-11-29 23:39:55 Reminds me how they used to manipulate stocks in 2000 on message boards and bash people with solid insight.  Can’t wait for the guys in the blue jackets to show up.
49 2018-11-29 23:39:45 Doesn’t matter at all if they will or not. But the fact that they can means that bump stocks are essentially obsolete and no longer need to be produced.
50 2018-11-29 23:37:38 Benjamin is right. Leave the fish in the sea! At least for five years so stocks recover. Then have only small vessels, no trawling.
51 2018-11-29 23:37:16 honestly all these ones forming I've never heard of Nora Roberts are just mumus abeg. The average thrift book seller here knows and stocks her books talk less of readers. You might not like her work but don't deny her reach jor.
52 2018-11-29 23:36:55 Call friends and make them but it for you before stocks sold out
53 2018-11-29 23:36:53 @jimcramer booyah! The Oil now down, what do you think about Airline stocks? $AAL $WJA $DAL?
54 2018-11-29 23:34:56 Yup! And coming from the Pres it is even worse, perhaps not on this level, but if he promotes one big company over another it can  really affect the companies and stocks for them etc.  so it is not permitted. Only Trump fans are likely to buy those books anyway, luckily!
55 2018-11-29 23:34:27 (Bump stocks don’t enable a firearm to discharge more than one shot per “function of the trigger,” ergo are not covered by the statute governing parts that convert a semiautomatic weapon into a machine gun.)
56 2018-11-29 23:33:52 Hello I'm Griffith and I'm addicted to buying stocks

60 2018-11-29 23:33:19 Unpopular but true: the fishing industry is a tiny part of the UK economy and needs a sustainable management policy to ensure conservation of stocks - and fishing communities need (EU) support for economic diversification.
61 2018-11-29 23:33:15 Martin. Total idiot.  No deal means warships protecting fishing vessels and no agreements to protect stocks. Better to sort these things out sitting at the top table #bbcqt
62 2018-11-29 23:32:49 That the both of you are American laughing stocks?
63 2018-11-29 23:32:33 Hell don't let Bloomberg write about this shit just for stocks to drop for others cause facts are stated again 
64 2018-11-29 23:32:07 Aproveitando o intervalo do 1T pra falar sobre a contratação de mais um americano. Agora o ex-Joinville, Stocks. Na minha opinião: craque. Vem pra somar nessa temporada e com a vinda de um possível pivô a gente pode até sonhar com um top7 fácil! Nem vou me iludir rs #NBB⁠ ⁠
65 2018-11-29 23:30:32 Congrats & Happy to see your Algo & Strategy is doing very well. Keep backtesting; the more you backtest the more confidence you will have on your Algo's Signal to Buy/Sell/Short/Cover in real life too. Backtesting will also show which Stocks/Sector it has high Risk/Reward too.
66 2018-11-29 23:30:20 Rebecca Long-Bailey, The French & Dutch were allowed by the UK Government to buy up all the Licenses. Now we have UK fishermen locked out of British waters. The French, Dutch & Spanish fleets clear the seas. 

We should copy Iceland & its innovative approach to stocks #bbcqt
67 2018-11-29 23:30:02 #bbcqt Fisherman will decimate fishing stocks for short-term gain.
In ten years time, a piece of cod will be the same price as caviar.

70 2018-11-29 23:28:19 Guardian ran an excellent article on fishing, insignificant as a proportion of the economy not to mention subsidies, quotas to preserve stocks etc. Again a leave lie #bbcqt
71 2018-11-29 23:28:14 It is very important to get back the 200 miles of British waters for our fishermen. We then can conserve fish stocks and improve docks. The French and Spanish are hoovering up fish and not putting the small fish back.
72 2018-11-29 23:28:09 Well Neil, I didn't know too much about bump stocks. But I asked some questions and I got some answers. I read that there are THOUSANDS of bump stocks out there, used responsibly. Now because of one nut using it, we have to ban them?
73 2018-11-29 23:28:07 Fishermen debate a complete fallacy: no amount of cod stocks will save you from stock market ruin on March 29th.  #bbcqt
74 2018-11-29 23:27:27 @realDonaldTrump I didn't think it was possible but you lose my vote the minute that bump stocks are banned. Shame, shame!

76 2018-11-29 23:26:42 #bbcqt  We MUST get our fishing waters back. Not only for UK fisherman ,but for future fish stocks.
77 2018-11-29 23:26:25 Most middle class retirees that worked in IT corporations or other large businesses do offer 401K's and these consist of mutual funds invested in stocks. If the company does not offer a 401K they will not attract new employees. They also contribute to the 401K.
78 2018-11-29 23:26:07 Marijuana stocks...we don't follow any marijuana stocks closely.  There is a special type of investor that can handle that type of volatility.  There is alot of uncertainty and valuations are still quite high if you look at sales. We are sitting out for a few more quarters.

81 2018-11-29 23:22:24 If people require the pension plan to only invest in what they deem to be ethical stocks, then they will have to accept lower returns and therefore much lower pensions when it comes time to retire and collect
82 2018-11-29 23:21:44 Do u need to move stocks with this?
83 2018-11-29 23:21:31 as for BTS members, i think it would be a wise investment to buy BH stocks specially if all of them are planning to continue producing music when they get old.
84 2018-11-29 23:21:06 My company has over $3.5mill in stocks n we hv seen over 3% returns per year n has not ever dipped to a critical level at any point. Do u hv stock options in US? Yes his policies affect may affect negatively but it doesn’t mean that much for long term market.
85 2018-11-29 23:20:19 Oh. Bump stocks. Well, I guess we're all safe again.

92 2018-11-29 23:17:51 Why are you banning bump stocks? Are you going to ban fingers or belt loops? Because I can do the same thing with my finger and my belt loops.  It’s people ..... not guns!
93 2018-11-29 23:16:45 If it ever comes to that ……  forget about stocks.  Just by guns and ammo.

105 2018-11-29 23:11:09 every comeback there were rumours of additional member or getting disbanded. thats when ELF, decided to buy stocks to have a part on the decision making atleast on SuJu career. and i think other members too already bought stocks.

107 2018-11-29 23:10:41 Where are bump stocks in the 2A?
108 2018-11-29 23:10:03 Let me explain, it is a fact that the bottom 80% of households owns only 7% of stock. So the previous comment that retirees rely on growth from stocks is probably inaccurate. 93% of stocks are owned by the top 20% of households.
109 2018-11-29 23:09:56 Could be anyone of the 99% of the stocks out there...

112 2018-11-29 23:09:29 Patriot One Tech $PAT Interesting story but they don't have the revenues coming in yet.  They need to prove that there is demand and that people are willing to pay money on a continual basis for their product. #investing #stocks

115 2018-11-29 23:08:05 you have to understand the reason why ELF bought SM stocks. rumours SM originally planned SuJu to be a rotational group like AKB48.  but ELF already love all the original members, so they petitioned to make the group permanent.
116 2018-11-29 23:07:23 @Danilo0014 você acredita que com a chegada do Stocks e um possível pivô para a equipe vascaína, fará com que o time Cruzmaltino possa brigar para ficar no Top 7 do NBB?

125 2018-11-29 23:04:39 Today’s bond rally was all about real rates, much more so than yesterday. Huge deal for stocks if you believe Fed is below neutral. If you believe the Fed is over neutral, then 10yr real rate at 1% is a decent yield.
126 2018-11-29 23:03:21 Anti gun advocates aren’t realizing that Trumps order for the ATF to ban and reclassify bump stocks is unconstitutional executive overreach. The executive branch has no authority to make and redefine the law. Bump stocks don’t meet the legal definition of a machine guns.

129 2018-11-29 23:00:17 @ahirschy31 Which stocks or industries are you bullish on in the next few years, if any?
130 2018-11-29 23:00:03 This is one of the best opportunities for investors. When stocks you like go down, thats good, you can buy them. Its a long term high risk play. But I like it.  Now you dont have to smoke either. They have everything under the sun now.

137 2018-11-29 22:56:35 Hey Jim. What’s your take on price action like happend at Pareteum’s ticker today. Tanking stock? Manipulation? MM Accumulation? Fears of dilution? Working to learn how to read big players moves on stocks like this.
138 2018-11-29 22:56:21 @SlimKirby I need help with stocks on fortune street
139 2018-11-29 22:55:08 Wearing a yellow star?! Who’s idea was that?! To protest Twitter is to start shifting to other social platforms by opening an account with @getongab or others, tweeting about it, sell all twitter stocks, then planning a coordinated week or month of twitter black out
140 2018-11-29 22:54:49 Sales or stocks?
141 2018-11-29 22:54:42 I Hate It
142 2018-11-29 22:54:37 @RepMaxineWaters as head of #WallStreet Good Lord we can expect a dump in store for stocks for sure. All our gains lost, so maybe we should sell sell sell before it’s too late
143 2018-11-29 22:54:14 They should be put in old fashioned stocks out in front of the school. Maybe some of that good old punishment would help. Or better yet, their parents should be out there with them.
144 2018-11-29 22:53:43 go trade some stocks 
145 2018-11-29 22:53:33 A toast then- to Stocks Hotel.
146 2018-11-29 22:52:44 Come on, the stocks are adjustable! I’m sure Ben could handle an MP7.

149 2018-11-29 22:49:10 Look at all the lemmings praising this move. You shouldn’t be applauding this because Trump has no constitutional authority to redefine the law with regards to the definition of a machine gun the Congress made. Bump stocks do not meet that definition. 26 USC 5845(b).
150 2018-11-29 22:49:03 @cvpayne @KarlRove Karl really didn’t understand your point which I want to echo. I don’t believe the GOP gets it. Young people today have watched the economy expand, stocks rise with the top 2% doing quite well. They don’t believe it’s fair & see Execs as greedy.
151 2018-11-29 22:48:27 Buy some stocks
152 2018-11-29 22:48:21 Market Close: MBS +3bps; DOW -27.59; NASDAQ -18.51; S&P 500 -6.03; 10yr Treasury 3.03%;  Stocks Close in the Red after a seesaw day, when they started in the Red and turned Poistive, then only end up in the Red at the end!  MBS closed off of earlier highs, some lenders repriced.
153 2018-11-29 22:47:59 Honey, there is nothing in the 2A that guarantees the right of owning bump stocks for mass murdering innocent people.
154 2018-11-29 22:47:47 Why do you need bump stocks?
155 2018-11-29 22:47:26 Stocks are down
Business is leaving
Your #TARIFFS ARE KILLING JOBS 
#maga 
156 2018-11-29 22:46:56 Plus having stocks going up is no measure of whether I’m worth following...a lot of very insightful folk are down YTD but are tweeting investing gold 
157 2018-11-29 22:46:39 I can’t imagine they sell the company with the stock down here either. Lots of clinical updates in 2019 though so if they stocks gets back near ATH’s they might be in a place to sell for a nice premium.
158 2018-11-29 22:45:06 Perhaps the @NRA will help their Members dispose of their Bump Stocks with a Membership Drive doing something useful for members fees rather than shoot political BS at them?
159 2018-11-29 22:44:30 @NRA no more bump stocks. Small step to preventing mass murder. No thanks to you guys.
160 2018-11-29 22:42:38 @markminervini Hi Mark! Love your books, since you don't hold stocks into earnings.. how do you handle your position after earnings? Say the stock went up 10% would you view that as too far extended?
161 2018-11-29 22:42:24 It actually does not require a bump-stock to bump-fire a semiauto rifle. You can do it with your belt loop. You can even do it without anything but your finger, if you do it right. Banning bump-stocks is an empty act that, like most other gun control measures, will not work.
162 2018-11-29 22:41:31 TradeNet room makes calls on stocks based on the chart.  They don't check if the security is tradeable or not... unless someone in the chat says something or they get a message when they actually try to trade it.
163 2018-11-29 22:40:38 The liberals have no internal strategy or consistency in their beliefs.  It’s anti trump 100 percent of the time.   I can’t wait to hear the liberals say trump is wrong for banning bump stocks on rifles next week #LiberalismIsAMentalDisease #maga #LiberalHypocrisy
164 2018-11-29 22:40:00 And stocks took the expected dive
165 2018-11-29 22:39:57 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
166 2018-11-29 22:39:46 Alot of the anti gun advocates are self righteous.    When you point out that citizens have to hand in their guns or bump stocks hoe can they be law abiding.  Yet they knowingly and willing break basic traffic laws every day.

174 2018-11-29 22:34:13 But seriously Kathy, I'm sure you know that one doesn't have control over the stocks bought under mutual funds. I'm glad that Rob clarified.

184 2018-11-29 22:31:44 Fujifilm jpegs have in-camera "film simulations" that mimic several of Fuji's film stocks. At base I suppose you could call them filters, but the implementation is more complex and subtle.

188 2018-11-29 22:28:50 Laughable. Stocks are always up & down, but if you look at the overall trends they are much better now. Whether you like Trump or not, you can’t deny he’s a genius level business manager. Who says cutting taxes doesn’t work ? Oh yes it does ! 
189 2018-11-29 22:28:33 No idea where you would get this concept from. As for debating you via WhatsApp? I have far more important things to do than that tbh. I highly recommend reading The Intelligent Investor or even a single BerkshireHathaway annual report to understand stocks. Applies to JSE too
190 2018-11-29 22:26:45 That’s because everything you did was to represent the upper one percent, which happens to include their asses, so of course you’re gonna promote they book. But the average working Americans don’t own any damn stocks, so your trickle down economics did shit for working clase ppl

193 2018-11-29 22:23:17 I may be off base here but when I think of stocks, market cap is calculated as price X outstanding shares. Woudn't that be the same for crypto in a sense, price X Circulating Supply. If this is correct, then I can see Korea included but escrow excluded
194 2018-11-29 22:22:50 Bump Stocks for everybody!
195 2018-11-29 22:22:27 A neocon would actually get something done while hiding from the press and becoming the most hated man on Earth. All Donald Trump did was ban bump stocks and end up in multiple lawsuits.
196 2018-11-29 22:22:23 ...2/2. So crypto exchanges are taking a page from the NYSE, etc., existing laws for stocks.  Crypto’s ARE (essentially. A few are not) stocks.  See where this is going?  Regulation = legit = big boy institutionalization = prices fly = we all make out.  #standards

They don't.

216 2018-11-29 22:10:17 What I'm saying is 1. I was invested in U stocks before 232 so whether or not it happens doesn't matter to me. And 2.

217 2018-11-29 22:10:09 It's an arb situation where you have 70% in cash and 30% in stocks. It basically is hedging itself. The real risk there is deal break risk (although the downside in that deal was limited) not market risk. Deal also just closed by the way

248 2018-11-29 21:53:52 I did not infer you felt bump stocks were obsolete. Using our logic, of a person can pull a trigger at the same rate a bump stock provides, a bump stock is essentially obsolete. Follow along, read the previous sentence a few times if you need to.
249 2018-11-29 21:52:39 Can bump stocks help me text faster
250 2018-11-29 21:52:30 I don’t think you understand what the word “everybody” means. I asked because I wanted to know your reasoning. And what would they be necessary for? If fully auto and bump stocks are necessary, why aren’t grenade launchers and tanks? Where do you draw the line?
251 2018-11-29 21:51:47 Might be a good time to short GM stocks with the threat of them losing there bailout monies.

253 2018-11-29 21:51:16 Which you incorrectly inferred meant I felt bump stocks were obsolete. I don't feel that way. Folks can also mimic the same rate of fire by hooking their thumb on their belt loop. And yes, there are people who can fire at or very close to the same rate without a bump stock.

257 2018-11-29 21:47:42 For all you lefties talking about Trump being a dictator, this a dictator move. The President does not have the authority to make new law and the current definition in law for machine guns does not include bump stocks.
258 2018-11-29 21:47:28 If xrp was 10, that would be a 1T market cap. The global stock market cap is 80T. Stocks are related to companies, market cap has limits because company revenue and profits have limits. The market cap of an asset is completely different as its based off perceived worth and demand

260 2018-11-29 21:46:06 So if that’s true, bump stocks would essentially be obsolete. So why not ban them then if they serve no purpose? Or were you being hyperbolic posing a question that implies a person can pull a trigger at the same rate as a bump stock provides?
261 2018-11-29 21:45:55 I leave the house for two hours and all hell breaks loose. #Bloomberg is saying police have raided Deutsche Bank..stocks tank. And something about Well Fargo, money laundering, and 150 million bucks.
262 2018-11-29 21:45:54 Hello! We will have a lot of stocks by next month but @NoFun_PH still has a lot of onhand extras~
263 2018-11-29 21:43:55 Bump stocks are stupid anyways.
264 2018-11-29 21:42:32 The Price-Earning-Ratio (PER) is an important quantitative measure to classify the stocks. But is there an equivalent for security, equity token? Utility token cannot have such a measure, since these token couple to e.g. a product use. #blockchain #crypto #analytics #stellar #xlm

266 2018-11-29 21:42:04 Bump stocks do not make a firearm fully automatic. Just look at the word “bump”. It bumps the trigger into your finger so you can shoot more quickly. Still one shot per trigger pull.
267 2018-11-29 21:41:21 Full autos aren’t available to purchase for everybody; they have strict regulations, which is a good thing. But I’ll ask again, why should bump stocks not be banned? Are they really necessary for self-defense?

275 2018-11-29 21:38:34 I can understand what you posted 100%. Seems like you aren’t following the conversation too well. You implied that bump stocks are obsolete since people can pull the trigger just as fast. You gotta keep up with your own examples lol, you’re not very good at this.

283 2018-11-29 21:34:59 Hey libs..  Trump just banned bump stocks. I'm sure you'll find a way to complain about it though. Wait you don't even know what that is? I'm shocked. 
284 2018-11-29 21:34:06 You can't understand what I posted and I'm diluted? Cool. According to you I've also handled weapons of war since I own several ARs. I never said bump stocks didn't impact rate of fire. Folks can buy full autos. They're not banned.

286 2018-11-29 21:33:50 Problem here is that Trump made populism cool, he justified a Marxist/Fascist portrayal of modern angry white males. White people lost a lot of their self-made value when serfdom was converted to racial stocks and went in more pity historically. #white #racism #society #politics

S&P -0.2%, Nasdaq-0.3%, Russell 2000 -0.3%

Bond yields fall on hopes Fed is nearly done hiking rates. 10-year T-note yield at 3.03%, lowest since mid-Sept.

300 2018-11-29 21:22:57 Legit question for anyone who has an answer: With @realDonaldTrump banning bump stocks. Does that mean he’s done more for gun regulation than @BarackObama did?
301 2018-11-29 21:22:34 I am all for the second amendment, but banning bump stocks doesn't impede our second amendment rights. A bump stock is not necessary for the gun to operate as intended. It's not ban on a gun, it's a ban on an unnecessary accessory.

306 2018-11-29 21:21:44 Gold will rise once stocks sell off and long term yields fall enough to go under the rate of inflation. In a non-crash scenario Gold would also do well once bond yields and dividend yields (either through higher prices or cutting dividend payouts) go below the rate of inflation.

314 2018-11-29 21:19:32 Only one way to find out =>I will try to figure it out.
I've tested volatility in ranking of stocks (punishing high volatility) and as a filter: excluding high volatility stocks. Results are worse and drawdowns the same, so risk adjusted worse off. But let's see what we get now.
315 2018-11-29 21:19:17 Been getting them a lot recently! Found a local place that stocks them.
316 2018-11-29 21:19:15 And their answer would be, what exactly? Fishing for bass has been curtailed due to demands from the British government, not to mention the ban on discards, again pushed by British gov.
They’re fishing in areas where they know those stocks are active, what do they expect?

324 2018-11-29 21:14:49 It’s only hyperbole in your diluted mind. I’ve handled weapons of war in combat. So if bump stocks provide no higher rate of firing than why have them at all? What’s wrong with a ban? Why not sell full auto while we’re at it? Why are those banned?

381 2018-11-29 20:44:43 Most people's preferences are established through habit/prior experience. Your first experiences were 3 stocks and that worked for you. 

There's no good reason why 3 stocks wouldn't rationally work, so you aren't necessarily wrong to feel that way.
382 2018-11-29 20:44:01 I don’t get the sense that a lot of 2 stockers really want 2 stock because it’d make the game better, but because less stocks lets them feel like they have more of a chance. No way I can prove this outright, but I wish people would be honest w/ themselves about their motivations

I know plenty of people who turned $10k investments into +$100k last year in crypto/weed stocks
387 2018-11-29 20:40:33 April 20, 2010. GM makes its final loan repayment. Government holds a 61% stake in common and preferred stock. GM Bought back their stocks back, repaying the Government.  Dec. 9, 2013. The last of four stock sales is completed. The government has no remaining GM shares.
388 2018-11-29 20:40:32 The idea is if you 'equal' weighted your returns will depend on individual stocks. It is better to have less in high volatility stocks and more in low volatility stocks. It would be interesting to see how your portfolio would have done during October had it been weighted by vol.
389 2018-11-29 20:40:09 China isn’t locals are in violation of rules. That’s gonna stop. Xi doesn’t want any foreign energy dependence. Aus will lose. And when Trump loses US will make those projects in mothballs. But hold on to our mining stocks sucka.
390 2018-11-29 20:40:03 Things you shouldn't invest in until you have at least $100k in the bank:

* Stocks
* Crypto
* Real estate

Things you should invest in until you have at least $100k in the bank:

* Your skillset
* Your business

This isn't even my opinion

It's statistically true

hey going forward is it physical gold you like or gold stocks or both?
394 2018-11-29 20:38:19 A fairly active day in FX with swings up and down within 50 pip ranges with Fed minutes, Presidential tweets and month end re-balancing all influencing price action. Stocks likewise opened lower in US and are closing higher as Oil dipped below $50 and bounced above $52.
395 2018-11-29 20:38:00 $EASI is a good #ETF example of how to blend two of the topics we discussed. Growth stocks in bullish times and short term fixed income in when momentum wanes.
396 2018-11-29 20:37:34 issues like a barrel that will melt at higher rates, firing pins that lock when overheated, that kind of thing, is how they avoid the "super human shooter" thing. (Actual term used in 1997 when they were debating a flat law on bump stocks)

A red dot would increase your skill,

398 2018-11-29 20:37:17 I assume this means stocks for pre-orders have been allocated and it's just going forward that people might find it difficult to find the set?

400 2018-11-29 20:35:44 Trade in premium stocks to begin with. Play it safe. If you make enough that way, but it into low yield safe accounts and let the interest accumulate on its own.
401 2018-11-29 20:35:14 The whole point is preference lol

Your personal preference is 3 stock, theirs is less than 3 stock. Less than 3 isn't necessarily more than 2 anymore than increasing stocks from 2 goes straight to 4

406 2018-11-29 20:33:00 Dear @baijorge of the Fantastic Fantasious Fantabulations: if you cannot understand the math, and don't know how stocks work, at least take note of the following: intelligent and successful investors invest in stocks.  Only guys like you invest in @crypto.  Why is that?

411 2018-11-29 20:30:54 "the government will gradually accumulate assets for the fund to manage, such as stocks, bonds, and real estate." The idea makes sense but the funding seems to be coming from the people that are expected to pay for it. This is where I get stuck on UBI.

413 2018-11-29 20:29:19 I consider trading stocks like playing a team sport. IF you want to succeed you must learn and grow with the people around you. Even the best traders sometimes need a mentor or coach just like any sport.. Always be open minded to growing as a trader my friends..
414 2018-11-29 20:27:31 As I see it, no, it is not bad. Landing those strings should in a reward and not just damage. Since Smash is based on stocks and knocking people off stage, tacking on damage is not usually the main goal. I look at Sheik in 4 as good example of the game state.
415 2018-11-29 20:27:16 Glad your patient had a good outcome but sad that there is so much gun violence in U.S.- I agree the U.S. needs reasonable gun laws.

422 2018-11-29 20:23:56 They have about four advanced degrees between them but they watch way too much Fox News. If Trump were just a little better behaved and their stocks kept going up, I shudder to think what they would tolerate.

when Zuck sold tons of FB shares before its 20% earnings plunge, that was the clue for everyone else to sell it too

then SQ and NFLX insiders sold a ton of their holdings, and those stocks plunged fast

4. Bitching about our speciality

5. Arguing who's cool enough to use 'yeet' in front of the teenage patients

That about covers it.
440 2018-11-29 20:17:35 Late last night Trump announced the ATF bureau will soon ban the production and distribution of bump stocks. A good day for the country if this happens

443 2018-11-29 20:16:25 Hearing quite a bit about bear market rallies... but you can't deny the, so far, very good price action across a larger and larger number of stocks.
444 2018-11-29 20:15:32 Just a reminder, with the impending federal ban on Bump-stocks, Trump and Republicans will have instituted more Gun Control in 2 years than Obama and Democrats could have hoped for in their 8... ready to vote Libertarian yet?
445 2018-11-29 20:13:52 He should ban bump stocks but then make automatic weapons legal just to rub it in their face.
446 2018-11-29 20:12:46 And i agree with that, but ill put it in a simple way, he works 80 hours because when he finishes his job he can make his company grow, change the world, his stocks are worth more and he gets paid more dividends.

If the gardeneer works 80 hours what are his benefits?
447 2018-11-29 20:12:41 Support GM instead of the presidential efforts.  Go buy one Trader.  Look at GM stocks Good choice to close American plants and keep Mexico and China employed.  Liberals are just stupid, and blind. He's trying and being fought daily.  He'll win. #MAGA @realDonaldTrump

450 2018-11-29 20:11:58 Ok I usually stay out of politics but my favorite part about Trump is how little the market moves when any sort of crazy news hits the fan.  Like the market has ALREADY priced in his insanity to the stocks.

467 2018-11-29 20:01:40 These things are hard to see when they are happening, but the crushing blows that global tech stocks have taken over the last 7 months, in the US, China and globally seems to portend some kind of shift in how the world sees, trusts and feels about a digital world.
468 2018-11-29 20:00:31 Stocks have turned up ...

473 2018-11-29 19:58:11 @MelissaLeeCNBC - growth - when rates fall, dividend discounts models raise potential PEs for high growth stocks; thats why growth stocks fly as rates fall thx to our main man Powell - value = schmalue
474 2018-11-29 19:58:07 doesn''t matter it's up who cares how it got here. This mkt make no sense so don't try and find any. Powell caved, party on, buy the stocks and forget about it.
475 2018-11-29 19:58:06 I think a secret to option trading is buying more lower priced contracts. The cheaper pricing cuts down on volatility, and for lots of stocks the delta can still be solid. Higher # of contracts allow you to capitalize on small price moves. 20+ contracts makes chop easier.
476 2018-11-29 19:57:55 For Christmas, instead of money, I want more stocks....does that make me old?

479 2018-11-29 19:56:02 This will be literally the only thing they ever do to gun laws. Any time its brought up in the future they'll say "but we banned bump stocks."
480 2018-11-29 19:55:15 You do a great job explaining your thoughts on the market and stocks. My dad, Jack McCarthy, ran Lord Abbett and loved making complex things simple enough for the average investor to understand.
481 2018-11-29 19:54:54 Should’ve invested in pot stocks.
482 2018-11-29 19:54:11 Stew, can you compare TWTR's today action to AAPL's Tuesday movement? Since dropping $2, TWTR has been recovering nicely.  Just want to hear you thoughts on this one, both stocks got negative news and behavior was "similar"
483 2018-11-29 19:54:07 anything we say is advice. people absorb advice and process it. we all process and make mistakes and successes. it is criminal to me that the best research on stocks and industries is never made public. thats a glaring criminal oversight by securities laws IMHO
484 2018-11-29 19:53:51 Man alive, this might be the best BUY STOCKS call out to date....and there have been some fuckin doozies
485 2018-11-29 19:53:32 Where did I say I couldn't distinguish that? Are you not able to distinguish what a true "weapon of war" actually is or do you just like hanging out on the hyperbole train? Are we no longer discussing bump stocks? Buddy.

490 2018-11-29 19:52:16 It’s prudent to have at least a starter position right now.  There’s downside risk if the stock market crashes and asset correlation goes to 1, but downside for uranium stocks is limited as they are deep value plays.

495 2018-11-29 19:50:51 Stocks up 1% on 857th trade war resolution headline and a Fed that appears to be turning dovish as the economy slows.
496 2018-11-29 19:50:40 To clarify, no one knows why any stocks go up or down. It's all STRAIGHT UP speculation. Anyone who tells you anything otherwise either hasn't taken one economics class or they want your money.
497 2018-11-29 19:50:04 I'd be okay with full autos being more affordable if bump stocks went away.
498 2018-11-29 19:49:59 Banning Bump Stocks is pointless. Does absolutely nothing to deter gun violence or mass shootings where bump stocks are rarely used if at all.

503 2018-11-29 19:47:21 Actually, lemme expand a bit. I didn't like Sm4sh and that was because my stocks just evaporated. I would play careful, have you at 140%, fish for the Bair to kill one time when I shouldn't and then get utilted three times by Ryu into an uppercut and die starting at 20%
504 2018-11-29 19:46:58 Legal impossibility.

Either bump stocks fall under 922(o) machinegun ban, or they don't. Can't "grandfather exception" some of them. If some remain legal, 922(o) will be overturned.
505 2018-11-29 19:46:23 I see it as a trade off. We can't fix just one or the other's gonna suffer. I'm not sayin' "let's disarm all Americans!", I just think the average gun owner can go without bump stocks and AR-15s. A pistol can do the job just fine.

512 2018-11-29 19:43:53 I wonder if the bump stock bans can be fought on ADA grounds, considering bump stocks were invented as an aid for the disabled.
513 2018-11-29 19:43:53 Little weird I’m buying Christmas presents off weed stocks I cashed out on, but people are throwin in jail for selling weed? 

Ima stay in my lane though
514 2018-11-29 19:43:44 One of the more interesting stories is of Prescott General. Started in 1974 with $2.5m in FUM. Down 50% in the first year. 
I imagine it took a while to recoup. But, by 2003, they had compounded for 30 years at 20% net (incl 1974). Picking fund managers is harder than stocks!
515 2018-11-29 19:43:15 Healtcare #stocks are leading. I see some very constructive #software stocks, too.
516 2018-11-29 19:42:20 ...but if I invested all my man weave money in stocks or savings or a business? I'm just sayin'.
517 2018-11-29 19:41:58 "Of the fifty most important stocks on the NYSE in 1911, today only one, General Electric $GE , remains in business...That's how powerful the forces of competitive destruction are."
518 2018-11-29 19:41:41 President Trump turns against NRA, announces plans to ban “bump stocks.”

520 2018-11-29 19:40:39 $TIP up 50BPS no wonder stocks rallying
521 2018-11-29 19:39:59 Thought the last buyout was done with stocks? Didn’t gov’t buy stock and sell back to company or on open market? Was pretty sure gov’t made money on the sale as well.
522 2018-11-29 19:39:42 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
523 2018-11-29 19:39:23 Agree...So many good stocks available at better valuations...Federal bank I like at current valuations
524 2018-11-29 19:39:19 Most people in the AR-15 world find bump stocks laughable. I know I wouldn’t want that garbage on one of my builds.
525 2018-11-29 19:39:07 “Regime Change is always good for everybody and makes my stocks go up and that’s always good and I have no idea what happened in Iraq in 2003: A memoir by @CFR_org “
526 2018-11-29 19:39:00 Home building stocks $tol $kbr $len $dhi looking toppish or stalling out. They have been leading the broader stock market. Lumber futures $LS have been leading home building stocks and they are going down hard again. I am watching lumber futures for broader market direction.
527 2018-11-29 19:38:28 Yes, the Instant Pot has been instrumental in stocking my (and my parents'!) freezer. Huge time-saver to have the option to expedite stocks, stews, and even roasts. I love cooking even more, now.
528 2018-11-29 19:38:25 I love small and medium size stocks... that's where the opportunity and inefficient pricing is. Historically, 95% of big winners are small & mid-cap names with less than 30 million shares outstanding.
529 2018-11-29 19:38:21 @realDonaldTrump don’t give away bump stocks without getting something in return. #SecondAmendment #bumpstocks #maga
530 2018-11-29 19:37:01 how do you determine a particular stock overbought or overstock....can mclean oscillators help for individual stocks too?
531 2018-11-29 19:36:49 seems the algos like to target low vol mom and pop divi stocks...
532 2018-11-29 19:36:33 Where would real estate and stocks be today if the ten year treasury offered a more normal positive real return? What would a 5% ten year rate do? To ask the question is to answer it.
533 2018-11-29 19:36:00 @timothysykes which subscription do you recommend first @StocksToTrade or @profitly just starting out?
534 2018-11-29 19:35:57 How is it without the clenow strategy though? Does volatility sizing work better then say 10 stocks and 10% each?
535 2018-11-29 19:35:51 i get such a rush when i invest in stocks. why am i so weird lol
536 2018-11-29 19:34:51 I’m talking in general terms. Have a target mix of stocks/bonds and re-balance back to them with a disciplined system that removes the emotion. Like how often you get a haircut, everyone has their own preference.
537 2018-11-29 19:34:15 This isn’t the only company making false public announcements to try and boost stocks. You’re onto something keep digging ;)
538 2018-11-29 19:33:54 @foimbert you’re just a hack aren’t you? Be honest. “Stocks fall on news Navarro is attending the Trump-Xi dinner on trade
PUBLISHED 9 HOURS AGO UPDATED 18 MINS AGO”
539 2018-11-29 19:32:47 I don't care what they say, they changed their option trading. When i 1st started there i was able to sell and buy in the same day, then all of a sudden earlier this month i had to wait a day to trade again. They said because i was trading volatile stocks.
540 2018-11-29 19:32:23 The currency collapse has been in the works for over 40 years. Fiat currencies usually fail within 30 to 40 years. 

There are also demographic trends. Many baby boomers are reaching retirement age and will be cashing out stocks and selling their homes.

544 2018-11-29 19:29:37 The sentences "stocks have turned higher" and  "stocks fall" shouldn't be on the same post. What market are you watching?
545 2018-11-29 19:29:06 Continue bullish selective Chinese stocks,,
546 2018-11-29 19:28:12 It appears he is working on a final copy of the bump stock legislation... I'm sure that's something you would approve of... Or are you now for allowing bump stocks?
547 2018-11-29 19:27:00 O McKie pelo Stocks? COM CERTEZA!!
548 2018-11-29 19:26:15 What decrease in consumers(satisfaction) can Bethesda, Blizzard, and EA realize, until they change something up. If I was an investor I would be furious with the lack of delivery of product. Can't imagine how low stocks are going to drop until proper decisions are made.
549 2018-11-29 19:25:49 Stocks go up bc the economy is strong. 
Once rates start to rise, the economy isn't strong any longer and stocks dip.
Fed changes language and now stocks rise.
So, is the economy actually strong? Or this is all some bullshit and we are in for a really big ass kicking?
550 2018-11-29 19:25:37 I hate betting unless it’s just between friends, put my gambling money into high risk stocks instead if I want the adrenaline
551 2018-11-29 19:25:35 Loose it all on stocks
552 2018-11-29 19:24:51 Disculpen x inmiscuirme, si cada estado realiza un inventario de sus cementerios y un ente consolida esa info, se podrían recuperar algunos y conocer las averías mas repetidas q tal vez optimicen los stocks y hasta ayude reducir su incidencia
553 2018-11-29 19:24:26 10k on stocks, see where it gets you
554 2018-11-29 19:24:23 Here’s a suggestion if you’re just fed up with being paid chump-change dividends. Sell all your holdings in those companies that only benefit the shareholders with the most shares, and reinvest that $$$ in company stocks that don’t pay dividends. There are plenty out there.
555 2018-11-29 19:24:12 Housing has been slowing down for two years. The tax cut you and Ryan are so proud of did away with many of the deductions that familes depend on. You were warned that Tariffs on Steel would hurt car.Just before you announced them, some of ur friends traded massive steel stocks.
556 2018-11-29 19:24:06 patting yourself on the back? bump stocks are a gimmick and Trump is going to ban them. he already said he would, long before you all started with your schtick. your organizing did help that. most gun owners think bump stocks are idiotic anyway
557 2018-11-29 19:23:51 Stocks back in the green post #Fed minutes...they seem to like the flexibility the Fed seems to be trying to bake in for the future
558 2018-11-29 19:23:44 @realDonaldTrump Mr. President, if you ban bump stocks you are, in an official capacity, violating the 2nd amendment, and by extension the Constitution you swore an oath to uphold. Don't be pushed around by corrupt morons in Wash DC.
559 2018-11-29 19:23:39 The NRA is a civil rights organization and as such should fight this. I totally agree, ban the bump stocks but pay for them at $150 not outright confiscation.
560 2018-11-29 19:23:23 Here!!! Tomorrow G20 meeting some bad News to China could be dead $TGT stocks. Then I load it up to pay back. Now 2 points. Who's know tomorrow I could get 6 points. 6 x 5000 woow
561 2018-11-29 19:23:22 Stocks turn positive after fed minutes are released.
562 2018-11-29 19:22:32 “Only a COUPLE of participants believe Fed Funds is near Neutral. Means market misread Powell”
This is not dovish. Nothing has changed. “Talking” dovish to boost stocks in the ST but until they crash, will keep raising rates.
Actions speak louder than words, especially for #Fed.
563 2018-11-29 19:22:04 U have bump stocks?
564 2018-11-29 19:20:24 Very constructive to see markets come back like this. Good action.  #stocks
565 2018-11-29 19:18:54 Things that matter less than a lawyer lying:

566 2018-11-29 19:18:53 Defenestration stocks are already on the rise.
567 2018-11-29 19:18:48 Two trade headlines meant to fluff stocks and dovish Fed and we're finally green, with holiday-like volume.  Figured we'd melt up all day.
568 2018-11-29 19:18:30 We can take a look into what's occurring with your Stocks app. Which device does this occur with? Does this continue after a restart? May we have your current iOS version from Settings > General > About?
569 2018-11-29 19:17:50 Shortsellers manipulate stocks with impunity. They should be forced to cover within 48hrs. They frontrun trades w/HUGE& use lies, false media “hit pieces,” trolling politicians, share dumps etc. Need Uptick rule! Free &Fair Mkts NOW @Forbes @realDonaldTrump @SEC_Enforcement
570 2018-11-29 19:17:16 A lot of producing miners are now penny stocks after the 7 year bear market
571 2018-11-29 19:16:29 Stocks seem to embrace somewhat dovishness by FOMC
572 2018-11-29 19:16:23 Not much commitment here from buyers.  Looks like about 2 junior quants with the machines under their desks.  At some point "weak economy," strong dollar, might translate into weak stocks.
573 2018-11-29 19:16:12 Stocks turn green after the November #FederalReserve minutes point towards an expected rate hike in December, but also suggest the future pace may slow down due to rising threats to the economy.
574 2018-11-29 19:16:08 @Commish_Stocks
575 2018-11-29 19:15:04 @GunOwners will sue any action of the DOJ to ban or regulate bump stocks
576 2018-11-29 19:14:37 just sunk the last of my dough into DVD stocks
577 2018-11-29 19:14:32 Give me an example and I’ll try to map it vs returning via dividend. Expensive stocks simply shouldn’t be owned. If you are a company with an expensive stock, there isn’t much you can do to save your shareholders. Worst things IMO than returning capital at that expensive price.

583 2018-11-29 19:13:10 @DataSloth I agree I got time. Not arguing with u.. that why I have 191 stocks I trade slow 1 and fast 1.
584 2018-11-29 19:11:33 blows my mind people are suprised what did they think they were going to do put it in blue chip stocks?
585 2018-11-29 19:11:32 I know @GerberKawasaki likes the pot stocks and i think he's probably right. For me, i hate smoking so I can never feel the necessary conviction that one needs to hold on while prices fluctuate like an out of control rollercoaster. I avoid pot stocks. i dont like the business.
586 2018-11-29 19:11:28 Food and healthcare? Yeah, they really are and maybe you should spend more time considering ways to protect them, rather than, say, fucking bump stocks.
587 2018-11-29 19:11:22 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
588 2018-11-29 19:11:20 ojala siga cayendo, ya me gusto el bear market, he ganado mas haciendo cortos en 1 mes que haciendo largos en 6 
589 2018-11-29 19:11:08 I would have liked to have seen a comparison between public and private REITs, REIT sectors/types and a discussion of why some are so correlated with stocks, but this was good foundational knowledge.
590 2018-11-29 19:11:03 Will it be possible to short sell stocks while driving with the new models?
591 2018-11-29 19:10:47 We're coming into what is historically a VERY strong month in the year. We'll be ready.  Will you? Do you know "what to look for?"  We teach "what to look for." And it goes far beyond Earnings and Sales.  #stocks
592 2018-11-29 19:10:47 This is going to get awkward real quick

1. A bunch of bump-stocks are turned in.

2. In unrelated news, there has been a recent spike in drill-press sales.
593 2018-11-29 19:10:36 @Invest420 Is there a good source for market cap ranking of MJ stocks, similar to your revenue ranking?
594 2018-11-29 19:09:55 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
595 2018-11-29 19:09:48 Booming in your delusional head. Your tax cuts only incentivized companies to build overseas. The stocks are the lowest in a decade and workers and farmers are losing their jobs. It is going to get much worse. Your tariffs will cost households about 2.4k next year.
596 2018-11-29 19:09:38 Sold at 33ish...think that there are better rr stocks out there. Still love twitter so good luck. Might reenter if > 35$
597 2018-11-29 19:09:30 While I agree bump stocks are a complete piece of crap, I’ve seen some bills in states that seek to use this bill to sneak in more restrictive measures that would actually impact the civilian firearms owner. Like triggers that are competition style and magazines over 10
598 2018-11-29 19:09:02 Should we then ban red dots because they can increase your rof? What about different trigger systems? If we ban bump stocks because they can increase my rof, then all accessories must be banned because they can too. So should be ban all firearm accessories?
599 2018-11-29 19:08:24 But screw all that and pause rate hikes so that nonfinancial sector debt and leveraged loans can continue to ramp up! We need stocks ack to ATHs!
600 2018-11-29 19:08:02 I should’ve been on stocks  if y’all know how much a nigga bring in per day 
601 2018-11-29 19:07:53 Finding  stocks with good setups have become fairly easy, patience waiting for a good entry has been good for me. NOW THE HARD PART exciting
602 2018-11-29 19:07:16 Noticing a few trades that have been moving out of bases getting a slight pop from the Mello event the last couple of days. These moves are usually short lived and the stocks revert to trading how they usually trade soon after. Could get a sharp snap back to retest the bases 
603 2018-11-29 19:06:35 Why haven't STATES banned these stocks? Why is it that the Feds always have to do something? We are this far along with this issue and hardly anyone has done anything with it. Don't write your congress representative, write your governor!
604 2018-11-29 19:06:33 Pro Tip for $BTC fans: #FOMO phrase created to remind you to be careful of emotionally driven investing. AKA “psychology of regret”. Now it is a fucking reason to BUY stocks and BTC? #Killallthemarketers
605 2018-11-29 19:05:53 Yes, but when I'm trading stocks, I want/need certain companies to tank harder than the Sixers did.  God forbid someone drinks 29 of the 30 Miller's in their cooler and 1 goes warm after 3 days in a Coleman cooler.
606 2018-11-29 19:05:33 Sure, but he more than makes up for it with economic news like *checks notes*... massive GM layoffs, a year of flatlined stocks and 78% drop in foreign investment.
607 2018-11-29 19:05:23 The rearing of fish by the EA is to restore stocks immediately. Eventually and this case costs are submitted to the courts I persecution’s to cover the cost of the fish, in some cases that can take time.
608 2018-11-29 19:05:21 So, the #Fed minutes show that Chair #Powell delivered the message the minutes reflect 

- Data dependence
- Risk of overtightening
- No set path of rate hikes
- Less certain economic outlook

That means HE DID NOT BLINK because President #Trump berated him

609 2018-11-29 19:05:08 It might end up that way but lets hope that it works for 3 stocks please god

611 2018-11-29 19:04:54 Next week the @councilofdc will take up a #firearms control bill which would create a red flag law in the District, ban bump stocks & increase the prison sentence for having a high-capacity magazine from 1 to 3 years. A committee passed the bill yesterday. #GunReform
612 2018-11-29 19:04:27 Pot stocks with the high Beta (still) but they will all go directly after the global market for opioids which stands at $22.96 billion.
613 2018-11-29 19:04:26 Banning bump stocks was first & foremost a safety issue. There are many suits pending from injuries sustained by bump stocks. They are very unsafe in their operation statistically. This notion that we're on some path to more control is nonsense. If anything, it should be a recall
614 2018-11-29 19:03:51 I can’t wait till January when these stocks payout 
615 2018-11-29 19:03:50 This is what happened to our bump stocks.
616 2018-11-29 19:03:46 True. Banks should know that there are risks of losses, especially when they bet as massively as they did. They always warn us that our stocks can go up or down, mortgages must be repaid etc. If employees aren't responsible though, why have trained/certified traders vs anyone?
617 2018-11-29 19:02:24 Next week the @councilofdc will take up a #firearms control bill which would create a red flag law in the District, ban bump stocks & increase the prison sentence for having a high-capacity magazine from 1 to 3 years. A committee passed the bill yesterday. #GunReform

If these kids were white and the girl getting bullied was black it wouldn't be their race that caused this behavior. It would be their inculturation.
624 2018-11-29 18:59:35 Second amendment mentions nothing of ammo, bump stocks of any kind, also keep in mind the Supreme Court ruled the assault weapons ban constitution. Scalia wrote the opinion.

627 2018-11-29 18:57:47 Trump banned bump stocks but only because he’s going to start selling Trump stocks which are five times more dangerous
628 2018-11-29 18:57:43 Have difficulty seeing the pop. Dollar already had its rally since Q1 after the decline in 2017. A down, B up, C crash. Same expectation for stocks too. Not coincidence.
629 2018-11-29 18:57:42 You hear more and more about Central Banks (including Fed) buying stocks outright when the next downturn hits. Will that happen? They'll print like crazy totally destroying money?
630 2018-11-29 18:56:39 This story went to print today. Stocks of alcohol ran out at Parliament yesterday, leaving MPs having to work sober for a change. The runt that made the devastating order mistake has been imprisoned in the tower. Too right too!
631 2018-11-29 18:56:31 Stocks Slump On Report Navarro Back On Xi Dinner Guest List
 US equities are taking a sudden turn for the worse as The South China Morning Post reports that White House trade adviser - and its most ardent China hawk - Peter Navarro, is back on the guest list for Trump-Xi dinner.

Please help me im restricted from buying stocks
633 2018-11-29 18:53:40 $NBEV - That huge bear raid was an act of desperation by a big short. Seen those raids in biotech stocks countless times. An act from someone who thinks the stock is going higher. Lesson ? Don't EVER use stops. EVER !!
634 2018-11-29 18:53:32 Bush approved and Obama continued support and funding of GM bailout. The Treasury sold it's stocks of GM in 2013. I think the reported loss to taxpayers was appox. 11-12 billion dollars. Ford did not take part in bailout.

637 2018-11-29 18:52:20 I support #2A...and I frankly don't give a crap about bump stocks.  The are not "arms" or anything close to it.
638 2018-11-29 18:51:47 I'll wait for a substantive G20 agreement or a #Fed reversal of policy following a #crash of ~30% in the S&P. Until then, USD/CNH > 7 is the primary risk for #Gold and lower lows imho. Powell just pushing a DCB in stocks before the main event down imo.

But not to worry, this just reinforces my expectation that the #Fed will revert to "stimulus on steroids" once stocks are down ~30%, ~21/2200 S&P. Nothing has changed imho. #Gold #Silver

644 2018-11-29 18:49:18 I did see it. And some impressive coding for sure! I'm not using this system though. I use basic 6-12 month momentum on Nasdaq 100 stocks. S&P 500 stocks work better with mean reversion, in my backtesting. Different strategies, 5 stocks each is the way I go.
645 2018-11-29 18:49:16 So thats why your stocks are loosing......
646 2018-11-29 18:49:11 Watching all of this unfold as it does, is almost as good as Twitter porn.  meant in a good kind of way. I think we will see a rise in the value of stocks for body bag Manufacturing companies. Love it!! #MAGA
647 2018-11-29 18:48:59 Brexit seems to already be affecting stocks of Occam's razor.. #VicarGate
648 2018-11-29 18:48:58 Bruh, it’s not ridiculous at all. Banning bump stocks is stupid. Also, this is more an article 1 issue
649 2018-11-29 18:48:53 If bump stocks go I won’t be writing home about it. Frankly, they’re tricky to use, and there only a few good brands out there anyway. But binary triggers and pistols braces? No fucking way. The 2A has been beaten up enough as it is.
650 2018-11-29 18:48:28 POTUS Trump has only small part of his wealth in stocks all of which are managed by JP Morgan or are index funds. No direct involvement with investment decisions.
651 2018-11-29 18:48:22 Here for the "Trump banned bump stocks to distract from Russia" takes.
652 2018-11-29 18:47:21 What I mean is that that tragedy still would have happened without bump stocks, and that banning them isn't actual going to reduce the trend rate of gun deaths going forward.

I certainly did not mean to disrespect or dismiss those who died that day.
653 2018-11-29 18:47:01 @POTUS  You will NOT recover from your banning of bump stocks.  No wall, NO Fisa docs, and now your banning of 2A!   NOT winning!   You lied to us!
654 2018-11-29 18:46:30 There is no list because there is NO laws being broken and he’s not even being accused. I’m sure you hope American stocks plummet and we all lose our jobs and go bankrupt just so Trump would be blamed but I don’t.

656 2018-11-29 18:45:39 Yes Donald Trump, kinda like you said you stood with the 2nd Amendment and now your rolling over! You sign that trash legislation on bump stocks and loose my vote
657 2018-11-29 18:45:31 10% wealthiest of America own 85% of stocks.
658 2018-11-29 18:44:50 Hahaha she actually told me about buying stocks from the bank. I should try it in the future raw- good investment. Heehee I love it when she teaches me stuff about that

660 2018-11-29 18:44:25 People who cover #mining stocks shouldn't be pointing out volatility or stocks that have gone down. Seriously, everything you've ever covered has turned to shit!
661 2018-11-29 18:44:11 Tu fabriques pas des stocks (d'armes chimiques interdites par l'ONU) en quelques jours, les CRS ne pourront plus intervenir.
662 2018-11-29 18:43:24 Why not, Kyle? As a gun owner, I see bump stocks as a way to circumvent the NFA. From the NRA statement following LV, "The NRA believes that devices designed to allow semi-automatic rifles to function like fully-automatic rifles should be subject to additional regulations."
663 2018-11-29 18:40:42 All about whether we get a substantive G20 agreement imo, otherwise USD/CNH > 7 remains on the table for lower lows in #Gold. No #Fed policy reversal until stocks #crash Jan/Feb or before.
664 2018-11-29 18:40:22 I knew a kid that stocked shelves at the grocery store who traded NASDAQ stocks at that time. He had great hubris. I urged caution but he was too smart to listen to me. Luckily, after he blew out, the grocery store gave him his job back,  but he still had to eat a lot of crow.
665 2018-11-29 18:40:18 sounds like another good reason to short NASH stocks, lol
666 2018-11-29 18:38:34 @realDonaldTrump please do not make law abiding American Gun owners criminals with the proposed ATF rule on bump stocks and rate increasing devices. This goes against our 2nd amendment rights and will cause major problems to gun owners.
667 2018-11-29 18:38:32 @CNBCs @PowerLunch @MellissaLee, and that gorgeous nice Red hair lady. Excuse me, so bad with names.  For some reason 1 of my websites.  Twitter was one the stocks people were going attack it short, like in 4.  Think some anti Tweet vs. FB eaon I saw the attack board this morning
668 2018-11-29 18:37:39 3 stocks
669 2018-11-29 18:37:18 3 stocks seem to go too quickly in my opinion. I’d be content with doing 4 stocks.
670 2018-11-29 18:37:03 Just posted some of my past winners. Super stocks have either Great Earnings or Great Sales or both. Major part of our foundation.
671 2018-11-29 18:36:55 Stocks and securities: bad, stupid, fake, and detrimental to society.

That's my hot take.
672 2018-11-29 18:36:39 Closing my $BILI puts I bought yesterday. Still unsure how these China stocks are going to react in the next few days.
673 2018-11-29 18:36:35 Sure a business is going to regain stocks sold off during hard times, but there are also story after story about bonuses and wage increases directly related to the most current tax cut
674 2018-11-29 18:35:12 .@ATFHQ classifying bump-stocks as machine guns is wrong; they are stocks.  Semi-autos can be bump-fired without them. What's next, a ban on pulling  the trigger more often than X times/second? This is plainly another  INFRINGEMENT on the 2A right.
675 2018-11-29 18:34:29 All surrendered bump stocks should be given to Ollie north to sell to our enemies
676 2018-11-29 18:33:24 Donkey Kong has always had good options that were held back by how easy he is to combo and how god awful his disadvantage is. He's the same way in smash 4 but because of how broken ding dong combos + the game being 2 stocks he can actually be a threat in the meta.
677 2018-11-29 18:33:03 It is very interesting to analyze the composition of Google and Twitte shareholders. The top three stocks are all trying to please the CCP.

679 2018-11-29 18:32:49 U.S. stocks dipped in choppy trading on Thursday as uncertainty over the outcome of a high-stakes meeting between the United States and China at the upcoming G20 Summit kept investors on edge.
680 2018-11-29 18:32:48 Is there anywhere in the UK that stocks this?
681 2018-11-29 18:31:35 The only cowardice and weakness evident in this country are those that live in fear of a legally armed, law abiding gun owner. 
Bump stocks, just a novelty used once and easily duplicated without an expensive piece of plastic. Your irrational fear overwhelms your logic.

684 2018-11-29 18:30:23 Every time the stock market has declined, it eventually has more than fully recovered. Hedging the stock market by shorting stocks, or by buying puts on the S&P 500 Index, or any other method usually is expensive, and, in the long run, is a waste of money. -- Ed Wachenheim
685 2018-11-29 18:28:57 I'm as pro #2A as anyone you will find and I can't even get worked up about this issue.  Bump stocks are a novelty that make you inaccurate.

Doubt it costs Trump even one vote.

As mentioned in the previous responses, his opponent will likely be completely against gun rights.
686 2018-11-29 18:28:52 I see people like to buy popular stocks but the problem is that those are safe stocks you know the Nike, Apple, Starbucks are not going to lose money. So the return of your investment is small. In business you gotta take risk. I’ve made money but I’ve also lost money haha
687 2018-11-29 18:28:42 Ah oui je vois ... pop in a box fait souvent ça il me semble ... pour le calendrier ils aurait pas du surtout que les stocks sont très limité ! J’espère que tu le recevra bientôt !!!!!
688 2018-11-29 18:28:15 I will tell you the same that I told Jorge: Your mathematical "models" are USELESS on #StockMarkets, why? Traders and investors don't give a FUCK about it, millions of them are GAMBLING every single days on #Stocks, by seeing news and acting for rumours

Your models are an Utopia
689 2018-11-29 18:27:49 Do you even understand that these ARE NOT STOCKS????

691 2018-11-29 18:25:47 They are all making more money with the tax cuts than creating products, now running up their stocks so they all can get their $ before the crash.
692 2018-11-29 18:25:42 It takes so f***ing long to get fiat from stocks to echanges!
693 2018-11-29 18:25:10 The 'staying private longer thing' is a trend. But honestly, I think that people who say this is unfair aren't trading stocks. So much opportunity and the market has been insane. Everything amazing no one is happy. Looking for something over there you miss what's in front of us.
694 2018-11-29 18:25:06 I can't already high. No cash. I borrowed stocks to play $TGT 2 points  made better  no need cash

697 2018-11-29 18:23:15 have you read about the federal ban trump is putting into place on bump stocks?
698 2018-11-29 18:23:08 Bump stocks are novelties, no big lose.
699 2018-11-29 18:22:00 @AppleSupport hi there, having an issue with stocks app. Not updating. I’m on ios12. Is this a known issue? Any suggestions on how to fix? I deleted app and reinstalled. Same result.

703 2018-11-29 18:20:11 Do we care? I mean, honestly, Bump Stocks are gimmicky at best. The LV shooter would have killed more people had he NOT used one. Nobody I know that owns an AR (and I know A LOT who do) even owns a Bump Stock, or has plans to.

Let the liberals spin on this one. It's meaningless.
704 2018-11-29 18:19:43 News. We can get hung up on the "News."  A little bit of news is good. So a LOT of news must be really good. Not true. Better to focus on the "news" in the chart.
Open, High, Low, Close, Volume speaks VOLUMES!  #stocks
705 2018-11-29 18:19:33 @POTUS Ban bump stocks  means ban your  2A supporters.  Also, why do you keep allowing your cabinet to hire anti-Trump staff?  Like Pompeo?
Stop heeding BAD advice & STOP hiring anti Trumpers!  Not winning!
706 2018-11-29 18:19:11 The forex market is different from stocks and what not. You basically trade different currency and you master it, you can literally turn pennies into hundreds of dollars. O started learning last year but stopped. I’m finna get back on it
707 2018-11-29 18:18:54 A common opinion among economists was that our economy would collapse if Trump was elected.
It didn't.

They also thought that stocks would plummet.
They didn't.

It sounds to me like economists need to focus on the economy a little better, and leave political opinions out of it.
708 2018-11-29 18:18:41 I don't care for the article.  1st argument they make: "Probably can't."  2nd argument is "if they can, it doesn't matter."  That's weak.  I think bump stocks get banned as an accessory, one way or the other, very soon.
709 2018-11-29 18:18:24 Was going to ask you to invest it. Work your stocks and shares magic for me!
710 2018-11-29 18:17:40 And you hear someone saying "WE HAVE ENOUGH FUEL STOCKS"...Its so sad!!
711 2018-11-29 18:17:36 Curious about how many have stocks and what % of stocks are owned by employees
712 2018-11-29 18:17:17 How has it led us to a safer future? Bump stocks were almost never used in shootings at all and they would not have prevented or detracted from the damage caused at parkland.
713 2018-11-29 18:16:58 I haven’t looked at my weed stocks in 2 weeks

715 2018-11-29 18:16:24 "The bump-stock ban is, and has always been, a smoke screen. Making these devices illegal will do nothing to reduce gun violence. That’s why they’ve become an easy target for the Trump admin. Banning bump stocks won’t make people safer, but it’s a simple way to pretend to."
716 2018-11-29 18:16:24 Liberals on drugs: "Banning things doesn't make them go away!"
Trump: "We're banning bump stocks."

720 2018-11-29 18:15:53 The point is that Iran didn't give these to the Taliban, the Taliban procured them off the black market from captured stocks.
721 2018-11-29 18:15:19 Yea right I was so upset I couldn’t camp for 3 stocks in this game
722 2018-11-29 18:14:23 Yea. I can see the ragging Russian backed NRA members lining up to turn in their bump stocks because so many sane men have them. Let’s face it. This is much ado about until they get caught after a mass shooting. #NeverAgain
723 2018-11-29 18:14:19 He’s Lying. They artificially pumped certain stocks even when bad economic data. Apple, Amazon, Facebook and others were allowed to become monopoly companies... Oil and steel stocks were down and some went out of business. #Qanon

731 2018-11-29 18:07:48 Watching to see if the $SPY can break above 275, better yet above the 200-day SMA to 276, and close above it for at least 3 days. That would be more bullish for stocks. #stocks #stockstowatch

741 2018-11-29 18:04:02 @CNBC I’m still amazed in this world you have guests on who buy stocks and options Then come on the show and pump those recs to viewers. Scratching my head
742 2018-11-29 18:02:46 2/ However, this term excludes stocks that are saleable, but unlikely to be sold. Thus, your definition has the disadvantage of not mapping onto either the concept of MC or free-float MC. This is a pedagogic disadvantage
743 2018-11-29 18:02:35 1/ A MC for stocks includes all stocks outstanding - including shares that are not saleable unless the SEC grants permission. A term exists for calculating the market cap of those stocks that are available to buy/sell: free-float MC.
744 2018-11-29 18:02:30 I’m a depressive sensitive artist 2 begin with. I’m NOT normally an overly crazed & obsessed person mad at the world kind of person.

757 2018-11-29 17:56:03 Hmm. But gold is also down over the past year. As of right now, all assets are a weakening reflection of a tightening dollar. Gold, stocks, real estate, and Bitcoin all reflect a stronger dollar. It makes sense considering Bitcoin is supposed to be a hedge against Fiat currency.

763 2018-11-29 17:52:08 This isn't about bump stocks. This is about gov arbitrarily changing the definitions of "convert" and "full-auto" and "semi-auto" in order to ban a piece of plastic.
An admin hostile to 2A WILL use these same methods to ban anything that "makes a gun fire faster".

That's bad.

768 2018-11-29 17:50:53 The tax cuts saw an increase in companies buying back stocks and moving companies overseas. The tariffs are hurting your base in the rural US. Most families can't weather a $500 emergency.

773 2018-11-29 17:49:11 You're right in general, but some of the games that get played the first 24-48 hours for IPO stocks like $SNAP $TWTR etc. to drive the price unreasonably high so all the early investors can cash out is not ideal.

776 2018-11-29 17:48:34 @POTUS banning bump stocks and just lost my vote for 2020
777 2018-11-29 17:47:39 I would spend 5% on travel around the globe. Move 20% into high yield savings. Invest 20% into index funds, 30% stocks. Use 25% for real estate investments. Finally publish my first book of photography.

785 2018-11-29 17:44:09 US mass shootings in 2018 alone has reached a shocking number of 316, with 346 shootings in the year of 2017. Over 80% of the American population supports stricter gun control. Let's ban assault rifles, bump stocks, and other damaging tools. #NeverAgain @Gov_Election18

791 2018-11-29 17:42:37 Sadly my stocks haven’t matured. Enjoy your time!
792 2018-11-29 17:42:34 just about every state has banned bump stocks only a select few havent and companies that manufactured them have quit making them?
793 2018-11-29 17:41:40 Apparently very soon Trump, the President everyone loves to hate, will be signing an Executive Order banning the use of bump stocks with guns...can someone tell me what Obama, the President everyone loved to love, did for 8 years?
794 2018-11-29 17:40:17 Why even have a stock market if the government that prints money decides stocks are going up, no matter what.  Everything loses meaning.  Trump has turned me into a nihilist.  RIP capitalism.

802 2018-11-29 17:35:16 I'm saying that banning bump stocks is no more an infringement the 2nd Amdmt than is banning fully automatic, repeat-fire weapons that bump-stocks imitate.

NB that calling a bump stock a "toy" mitigates the notion that the amendment exists to arm citizens against the govt.

We need to be going on the offensive! #bumpstockban #SecondAmendment #DonaldTrump
856 2018-11-29 17:14:34 They are changing by regulation. To do it they are reclassifying bump stocks as firearms. But they don’t fit statutory definition of firearm or machine gun. The ATFis going beyond the authority given by congress by defining a new class of weapon. Dangerous precedent.
857 2018-11-29 17:14:28 From your thread, you could do that when you're ready to get back in, with your psychology in check. Wont take positions in TSLA or penny stocks.

The crypto move happened mostly overnight and in the morning.

The stocks move started at noon EST.

One was driven by a short squeeze off most oversold levels in history. The other by the Fed.
861 2018-11-29 17:12:19 Lol, that'll work. While criminals are lining up to turn in their illegal bump stocks, they'll be bringing their illegal drugs to turn in as well.

872 2018-11-29 17:08:29 Seriously how is that an argument?  

How would you use a bump stock in a self-defense scenario? 

Would a military ever field them?

I could make a better 2a case for full auto than bump stocks.
873 2018-11-29 17:08:22 That's how probabilistic models work.  We use them at my fund (very different from elections of course) . Lots of individual  stocks don't do what you predict but in aggregate  the model works
874 2018-11-29 17:08:06 Also, you will allow Member States to pay 25% of the cost for a new vessels over 24 meters, how is this benefiting the small scale fishers that you focus on in your PR? Also there is no way to guarantee that these vessels only target stocks that are in balance!
875 2018-11-29 17:07:41 That's funny. Many thousands more Americans are slaughtered every year than Australians. At least Trump has at last started to regulated guns. Banning Bump Stocks.

877 2018-11-29 17:06:48 Which stocks to buy, Tesla or VW? From an impact perspective, the larger manufacturer is better. But if an average car has a 20-year useful life, it will continue to support fossil fuel beyond even 2030. Different impact then.
878 2018-11-29 17:06:16 Continuing to slide on Brexit concerns were property stocks, with British Land and Land Securities falling by 5.8% and 4.9% respectively, although the latter of the two went ex-dividend to the tune of 11.3p
879 2018-11-29 17:06:08 Bit harsh. Perhaps just put offenders in the stocks outside, and  throw whatever food they were eating at them. 

Not so bad if it's Pringles. Bit more chancy if it's a pineapple.
880 2018-11-29 17:06:03 @realDonaldTrump We love you Mr. President but please dont betray your most loyal constituents (the people that got you elected) and sign that bill that bans bump stocks. Liberals will celebrate, we will cry, and crime will continue. #MAGA #NRA

889 2018-11-29 17:01:37 why do you think the stocks went up after gm laid off all those ppl? @B_Rich33NO
890 2018-11-29 17:01:17 Yes, a ban on bump stocks means no guns for poor people, right. So many constitutional scholars on Twitter, who knew?

901 2018-11-29 16:59:53 This is false.  The ban would be on NEW bump stocks being sold.

Much fraud & manipulation is surrounded by toxic debt (convertible) in microcap stocks. Market makers will short at an increased rate as to gain as price decreases. This increases reverse splits & destroys the retail investor

950 2018-11-29 16:40:34 President Trump will sign a gun control bill outlawing “bump stocks”. You just created a new black market business that will cater to criminals. No law abiding person would use a weapon with a bump stock to kill people. Criminals will. A 3D printer. Sell them for 1k each.

973 2018-11-29 16:34:58 You could say it's the G5 coming down the pipeline, or the fat dividend yield, or good management and solid business prospects. Yet, i'd say some of the recent bullish move has been fueled by institutions seeking defensive stocks. Retracement to $57.40 area possible imho
974 2018-11-29 16:34:52 Asset appreciation has been weak, wealth effect therefore has been weak. Feel good happens when at least one asset class appreciates. What has happened in India is that real estate can’t really be allowed to appreciate, and stocks have been beaten down by govt choices.

991 2018-11-29 16:28:39 The govt thinks bump stocks are the low hanging fruit of firearms and people who don't own them or think they're gimmicky will shrug. I don't own one but I will not be silent if they try to ban them.

1013 2018-11-29 16:22:23 Doesn’t it puzzles you that this young generation should now look at traditional stocks but still doesn’t care about it and is obsessed about crypto currencies? I have young children playing video games. I am amazed how they are already confortable with non fiat currencies.

1037 2018-11-29 16:08:16 No. Bump stocks allow normal guns to be able to fire more like machine guns. You can own guns and defend yourself without military grade technology.

1050 2018-11-29 16:03:13 Deep thought: watching Trump voters staying loyal to Dear Hairpiece while being boned by job losses or rotting soybeans etc. is kin to the impulse that leads folks w. crashing stocks to ride them all the way down: admitting a mistake carries too high a cognitive/emotional price.

Most people let others do that for them, and can get a spreadsheet made up to disprove your claim. Oil? Really? Let me put it this way. Trump is the only president to date that can influence stocks.
1081 2018-11-29 15:52:08 So the idea is if we ban bump stocks then all mass shootings are over. BRILLIANT !!! The idea that these are the problem and a ban will solve it is as crazy as the mentally disturbed person that does the shooting.
1082 2018-11-29 15:52:07 Should be a wash, but when hedging you lose a bit in higher MER. So, higher MER plus more volatility. I imagine it's the opposite for American investing internationally. You'd want the hedging because the USD rising during "risk-off" plus decline in intl stocks = double whammy.

1128 2018-11-29 15:39:29 Senator Paul you need to challenge the Trump’s administration on the ATF reclassifying bump stocks as machine gun. 26 USC 5845 (b) defines a machine gun and a bump stock does not meet that definition. Executive branch has no constitutional authority to redefine the law.

1139 2018-11-29 15:36:43 I am so satisfied that Apple has had its worst month in stocks since 2008. I feel that's karma for the way they sell faulty products to their consumer and blame it on "updates/battery life" esp. when that life isn't based on when you actually open the package but when it was made
1140 2018-11-29 15:36:41 Hey Joe Kennedy what about morel capitalism? I'm buying up stocks in mushroom farms over here. Let's get that fungi money my dude.

1142 2018-11-29 15:36:16 Maybe same reason stocks fall when he says the opposite. That too happens daily. 
1143 2018-11-29 15:36:16 Oil is broken. It has fallen 35% from its high in last 8 wks. It can bounce here but no way its going to higher highs in a market melt-up,not even close. There's a lot more downside ahead in the next yr.I wouldn't be putting money into energy stocks now. Much better opportunities
1144 2018-11-29 15:36:03 Woah! Wth happened? Is it tech stocks again?
1145 2018-11-29 15:35:55 Stocks surged yesterday following dovish comments from Fed head Powell in which he unexpectedly announced that rates are now a fraction under a level he considers neutral. Catalyzing a rally that forced bears to cover short positions and launched the S&P 500 higher by +2.3%.

1147 2018-11-29 15:35:08 Regardless of that, the @NRA has financially supported politicians who have voted against common sense gun laws such as universal background checks, banning bump stocks, and limiting capacity of magazines for ARs etc. That last one was passed in CA by voters but blocked by NRA...
1148 2018-11-29 15:34:41 Then step up and support sensible legislation to keep guns out of the hands of people who should not have them. Stop supporting the indefensible, such as silencers, large capacity magazines, bump stocks. See how that works? Be responsible. Try it.
1149 2018-11-29 15:34:28 my bad, I thought I read on twitter that your portfolio didn't do much before you sold. I must have misread.
If many stocks did worst than -37%, this also means many stocks did better if the index was -37%.
1150 2018-11-29 15:34:18 $BNE.TO dropped 12% this morning on the announcement of the dividend cut. Half an hour later it's only down 2%.

So on the contrary, I believe once the widely expected dividend cut parade is here, explosive rallies will be triggered in the compressed Cdn Energy stocks.

1157 2018-11-29 15:31:16 That's because sweet f#%k all is moving well.. so traders gravitate to stocks like BIT & CHK purely for the pumps. Nothing wrong with that unless you get caught holding too long IMO.

1170 2018-11-29 15:28:59 I knew it. All of the money they borrowed for stock by back !!
The cash spent = liquidity. Also trillions kept off-shore !!
They leverages 'value' to a false ceiling=company's, eg stocks, over value.
Dumped the reserves, & off shore money can't be counted, eg not taxed.
IDIOT.

Fed balance sheet eventually going to 50% or 100% of GDP, they'll buy corporates, maybe stocks, negative 10Y nominal yields etc.  Everything we've seen elsewhere is coming to the US.

1183 2018-11-29 15:24:05 So... No more "fully semiautomatic" guns?

Im very pro-2A. Im open to the ban as long as it's not worded in a way that, a generation down the line, is used to ban other guns that have nothing to do with bump stocks.

1187 2018-11-29 15:22:37 And in THEORY, striking down a ban on bump stocks COULD lead us down a road towards striking down the ban on full-autos entirely.

 I mean, the GOP could have gone ahead and DONE that sometime in the past two years, so I'm not banking on any of this.

1290 2018-11-29 14:48:54 @realDonaldTrump Just read about your ban of bump stocks. What a dumb idea. Murder is already illegal and it does not stop crazy people from doing it. You punish law abiding citizens and it will change nothing. Waste of time.

1352 2018-11-29 14:28:56 It bothers me that the  Whitehouse is thinking about banning bump stocks. Yes I think they're a stupid waste of money, but banning them after only known crime committed with them opens the door for so many bans.  @realDonaldTrump  keep your promise, protect the 2nd ammendment

Bump stocks are corny as fuck. #2A
1354 2018-11-29 14:28:09 The last bump stock bill banned far more than bump stocks. I'm sure this does too because the point isn't bump stocks at all. It's not about people's safety either. It's about denying your rights. You've gone to the dark side.
1355 2018-11-29 14:27:50 The last conference call hosted by the company provides a timeline for your decision making. Listen to it again. Biotech stocks move on both data and business development announcements. I don’t think $ZIOP is binary. Three distinct products, science, much IP with value.

You are just a sideline critic; he’s the man in the ring.  You’re glib and cute; he’s bloodied and driven.  People admire him.

1381 2018-11-29 14:17:45 So Amazon is now making ARM server chips! Intel is in big time trouble!
I think with this news there will be stocks rising and falling!
1382 2018-11-29 14:17:28 "ban on BUMP STOCKS": REPORTED BY @LYNETTEROMERO (November 29, 2018; 6:14 PST) #DONALDTRUMP #TRUMP #FAIL #KTLA
1383 2018-11-29 14:16:46 Bump stocks allow people with disabilities to fire their rifle effectively. If I remember correctly the assc for people with disabilities was against their ban for this reason
1384 2018-11-29 14:16:31 I want to see them in stocks and pillory  in Times Square
1385 2018-11-29 14:15:24 "If I'm elected, you won't lose one plant, you'll have plants coming into this country, you're going to have jobs again, you won't lose one plant. I promise you."

1388 2018-11-29 14:13:39 I don't like any EU stocks or whatever investment. If they are split I do like. Will do for English stocks. When they done split.

1392 2018-11-29 14:12:47 More like 'bubble on' it could be stopping the hemorrhage in the leveraged loan market, the weak link. Not like liquidity for stocks but for these garbage loans. So Fed is in a box. Higher rates and landmines will go off... lower rates and LL's issues compound.
1393 2018-11-29 14:12:03 I nvr trade on headline grabbing stocks.
1394 2018-11-29 14:12:03 Haha while stocks last.

1396 2018-11-29 14:11:45 2 stories that would make great #Arctic features: 1) the agreement on central Arctic Ocean fisheries (precautionary principle! Asian states’ 1st Arctic Agreement! Russian reluctance overcome! Unknown fish stocks! Negotiated between both  Obama and Trump Admins!)
1397 2018-11-29 14:11:34 I think that's wise. If you have the time, I can recommend spending some time a day (say 30min maybe) to track a select number of stocks over time to see if they are stable. But go for it, you'll get returns either way.
1398 2018-11-29 14:11:11 What happens when unemployment hits lows? What happens when wages slightly tick up? What happens when massive investment hits, what happens when companies have gobs of capital? A true trickle down...just takes a little bit. Stocks ticked up, and currency experts already moved.

1400 2018-11-29 14:09:20 The @NRA in my opinion actually has a decent chance to win back some favor from gun owners who are sick of their milquetoast “pro-gun activism”, by getting in @realDonaldTrump’s ear and telling him how stupid banning bump stocks is. Do I expect they will do this? Nope.
1401 2018-11-29 14:09:01 Remember in August when everyone went crazy about the weed stocks I bought in February & I got called a nitwit for selling

He did not explain how fed data/fed models from Oct were so wrong or how the CEOs he consults on business conditions missed it so badly to flip 100% from his Oct remarks. US is weak but he knew that in Oct or fed data is no better than ours

1408 2018-11-29 14:05:05 We grew up reading a home delivered daily paper everyday.  Our parents took us to many events, musicals, symphonies etc.  Dad followed the stock market, we glanced at his stocks, we didn't have LinkedIn.
1409 2018-11-29 14:04:24 Lol at fools that believe bump stocks actually increase potential lethality of rifles. Very lol.
1410 2018-11-29 14:03:59 This's a different argument

The #2A definitely expects ownership of the equivalent of a military grade weapon by civilian members of the militia. Select fire weapons fit that bill

But given the current laws & the asinine nature of bump stocks. I think this is reasonable
1411 2018-11-29 14:03:44 lol, funny you say that, The fiat bugs claim that gold was demonetized decades ago.

Yet its stocks to flows ratio keeps rising...
1412 2018-11-29 14:03:43 Stocks can get taken really quickly. It really depends on how the game develops later on.
1413 2018-11-29 14:03:38 Uranium stocks are still churning through the overhang from tidal waves that affected sub-standard infrastructure at Fukushima and the unfortunate associated social impacts. Spec stocks always follow the leaders, however with uranium I would be sticking with the front runners.
1414 2018-11-29 14:03:30 5 stocks like 64
1415 2018-11-29 14:02:43 Ford losing 22,000 jobs, GM losing 15,000 jobs. Dow Jones zero gains this year, S&P down 7% this year, Tech stocks down 15% this year, Harley Davidson lost 3500 jobs this year, Carrier AC lost 1800 jobs this year.... I can't handle much more of this winning.... Whats next?......

In a bull one gets wiped out by margin calls, trading, big bets, options, timing, chasing momo stocks.. Dumber. All lead to needed Wall of Worry that feeds the bull.

1434 2018-11-29 13:55:08 I’m tracking on what you are saying. When I look at S&P500 debt to equity ratio it is currently 86% (fairly low for 25+ years). When I calc the average for 2,500ish stocks (I look at profitable and in an index) I get 120%. I think it might be a tale of two markets kinda thing.

1437 2018-11-29 13:54:13 gotta love that "shared pain" theme as if millionaires and billionaires really felt any pain at all. Worker has $100k in retirement savings, loses more than half to the 2008 scam. Person worth $100m loses about $10m, gets their stocks bailed out, makes an extra $25m.

1441 2018-11-29 13:53:28 Jim, automatic firearms are not banned. They are regulated. Please read the National Firearms Act of 1934. Then I think you’ll understand why this “ban” of bump stocks will lose in court. #laws

1451 2018-11-29 13:49:02 Well any difference is better than nothing. Bump stocks serve no purpose other than for people to fuck around with or use in dangerous ways like the shooting. Lots of accessories like this that could be banned to limit someones lethality

1490 2018-11-29 13:36:07 Open Range H/L is critical. Unless stocks move out of the first 15min H/L there is no assurance the stock may see momentum on that day. So in a way a late entry as you may think is in fact a Momentum Entry where time out of a trade could be within the day itself.

1492 2018-11-29 13:33:44 But here's the MOST important ?: Are lower #interestrates bullish or bearish for stocks? I'm inclined to say bearish for most (besides #SafeMoney names), as slowing growth isn't good for #earnings. Noteworthy that $VIX bouncing here along with yield drop. We'll see...
1493 2018-11-29 13:32:01 Interesting thing with Trump mentioning the subsidies GM gets and tying those to them announcing plant closures. Usual suspects dislike the “meddling” by Trump but the point remains, “why give you subsidies if you buy back stocks and close plants?”

1499 2018-11-29 13:27:58 @GM is the new face of corporate greed in America, a crime syndicate in broad daylight, and a common theif. With all the money they saved with ludacris tax breaks,  they just used all of it to buy back stocks, not raise pay. They're going as far as to close plants and cut jobs.

1508 2018-11-29 13:24:18 I remember all the chants of "Ban the bump stocks!" at his rallies vividly
1509 2018-11-29 13:23:14 This gives u daily candle range of stocks?
1510 2018-11-29 13:22:03 hey what was that thing that started all this talk about bump stocks in the first place? anyone remember?  something about Vegas?...
1511 2018-11-29 13:21:14 After every six months, stocks are being beaten out of shape . Never to rise again from last one year. With nifty rising people forget those stocks and again invest. This time bear market is all about stocks and not INDEX. Index bear market coming soon and then its all over
1512 2018-11-29 13:21:09 @realDonaldTrump even if that were true what about the 10s of 1000s of jobs that have been lost because ofYOUR tariffs?  the stocks for the steel company  tanked yesterday after u said that.why is that?
1513 2018-11-29 13:20:58 Thank you for your question Bambo. The President was right. These are the official maize stocks as of 22 November 2018:

Total Maize Stock at GMB Depots 1229 805 metric tonnes
1514 2018-11-29 13:20:07 We just had one about a 11% one over the last two months. I bought some stocks that had been overvalued. And am rearing to buy more.

1521 2018-11-29 13:17:59 Since it’s only an accessory, they really have no idea how many bump stocks are out there and no way of tracking who has them. Good luck. You can literally achieve the same thing with a belt loop or shoestring. It’s a stupid compromise Trump was willing to make.

1541 2018-11-29 13:12:45 Stocks started falling with US alert.   They start rallying with Canada alert?  Who says they don’t ring a bell at the bottom or top?
1542 2018-11-29 13:12:05 Maybe. Jay used his NY minute to save stocks. He did not explain how fed data/fed models were so wrong or how the CEOs he consults on business conditions missed it so badly to flip 100% from his Oct remarks. US is weak but he knew that in Oct or fed data is no better than ours.
1543 2018-11-29 13:12:05 Believe it. The best I've done with stocks is when I forgotten about them. I bought MKL in 2009 & didn't pay attention to it for years. I'm Up 3 X now. Same when I bought C in early 90s

1579 2018-11-29 12:53:21 And the ban itself is unnecessary. Bump stocks are range toys that are very rarely use in any crime. There is only one major and very terribly tragic event where they were used. If we ban them b/ c they were used in a crime we might ban hotel rooms as they were used in same crime
1580 2018-11-29 12:52:43 Personally I don't have a use for one,but they shouldn't be banned'it opens the door for other banning such as bayonet lugs,pistol grip stocks etc.

1593 2018-11-29 12:46:01 He has gone off the rails. This is proof that these individuals have not a clue what is happening in the world today. This issue screams of mental health period but they just want control. And it seems that they are going to get it. It starts with this ban that is on bump stocks.
1594 2018-11-29 12:45:38 Short version: calling bump stocks accessories pulls it out of the purview of the NFA and can’t be regulated by the ATF through the NFA since that’s beyond the statutory scope of the ATF.
1595 2018-11-29 12:44:46 They will go public I think? Which means purchase of stocks will be available for everyone?
1596 2018-11-29 12:44:17 Hmm, may stocks kapa yoko nga
1597 2018-11-29 12:44:16 1. Not just any point of view. An SGP point of view.

3. France is in the EU. Its fishermen can't make their own rules.
1598 2018-11-29 12:43:45 Half are being relocated. The other half including Canada will be laid off. It’s about GM buying back their stocks. Not with the economy! America will remember what GM did... and buy elsewhere!!
1599 2018-11-29 12:43:37 If the courts rule that bump stocks are not 2nd amendment protected, because they are accessories, that means the NFA and the authority given by it to the ATF don’t apply because the NFA applies to certain classes of weapons.

You don't need a bump stock with proper practice. I can do the same without a bunch of accessories.
1627 2018-11-29 12:34:09 Media triggered you to buy and FOMO $BTC past December. 
Media triggers you now to sell, as they claim $BTC and crypto to be dead.

The same occurs with stocks (Great time to buy stocks, Amazon going to 3K), houses and others. 

Don't play that. 
Play your own game.

1629 2018-11-29 12:29:45 U.S. carbon sheet-based stocks will likely be weaker tomorrow on the potential for further U.S. supply growth, while STLD investors may be a bit disappointed via potential for less bandwidth to pursue full-out share buyback momentum ($729M left at September's end)

1634 2018-11-29 12:26:21 No no, of course I strongly recommend to buy more of those overvaluated stocks.If you just hold money, it evaporates. So why not put it in the everything bubble machine, right? You sir, are a true visionary and I am happy there are still decent chaps like you around.
1635 2018-11-29 12:26:16 I confess - I bought Treasuries and cannabis stocks.
1636 2018-11-29 12:26:14 Today, 39 out of 50 Nifty stocks closed in green. Also in last 9 months Nifty never had 4 consecutive green candles with aggressive moves. Looks like Nifty set to touch close to 11000 mark in this move.

1644 2018-11-29 12:23:27 The stocks were in horrible condition. Wake up chief. The stock market is the highest it has ever been in American history. Obamacare was a disaster. We didn’t want it. It didn’t work and we are glad you are gone.
1645 2018-11-29 12:23:14 Maybe when we unmask them we can publicly shame them? Put them on fountain square in the stocks and throw tomatoes at them? Parade them in shame through the city? Get them fired? Ruin their life? All because of your interpretation of a twitter comment?

Seems rational.

1656 2018-11-29 12:14:46 Corporate stocks traditionally rise after layoff announcements. Is it a way to manipulate their stock price?

1664 2018-11-29 12:11:28 On the record.  When stocks are calculated for market cap it’s done by multiplying outstanding shares by stock price. Outstanding shares are everything, even those held by company execs, with the exception of those bought back by the company.   1/3
1665 2018-11-29 12:10:27 This will be interesting to watch play out. As much as I'm not a fan of bump stocks I'm also not a fan of people being forced to destroy their own property and not being compensated. Hopefully that doesnt cause any real issues.
1666 2018-11-29 12:09:38 Trump saying he may ban bump stocks and now Lindsey Graham making this statement. Funny how after this fantastic midterm election they now are start acting like reasonable adults. Too late now!!! Mueller is coming.

1710 2018-11-29 11:47:20 Bump stocks use recoil of a semi-automatic weapon (any adult with a clean criminal record can buy one) to make it fire more than once when the trigger is pulled, making that weapon fully-automatic. Congress passed the National Firearms Act to restrict ownership of full-auto guns.

Nifty ran 150+ points and most of the stocks not participated in this rally. Only reliance Hdfc Indus and kotakbank and few more supported.

It's just like 2 months back situation.
1738 2018-11-29 11:32:13 Very common rhetoric by Market Gurus. Buy a stock that goes at 25% CAGR & you will be very wealthy.
The problem is such stocks are bought by providence rather than analysis or prior knowledge.
Multibaggers are picked up by luck & not investing wisdom.

1742 2018-11-29 11:26:18 Investing is not a year of two strategy, and growth stocks don’t correspond necessarily to GDP. There are many bargains in down times, and new opportunities. It’s a choice. Most people can invest something out of their paychecks consistently by giving up something else.
1743 2018-11-29 11:23:16 Not one article by any other news organization. Obviously left wing media really doesn’t care about bump stocks just a way to blame republicans for mass shootings

1751 2018-11-29 11:20:56 KSE-100 down 65 points to 40638; KSE-100 Index declined 65.97 points to close at 40638.83, 151 stocks closed up 154 closed down while 22 stocks remained unchanged. Volume Bank of Punjab Limited closed at Rs 13.11 up 0.16 paisa.
1752 2018-11-29 11:20:00 Guess I'll be in Rob. Manila on the 1st then. Goodbye money.
I hope there are lots of stocks. 
1753 2018-11-29 11:16:13 Sure it’s a gimmick, but many are missing the point. It’s a start down a dark road. Bump stocks today, binary triggers tomorrow. Shouldering SB Tactical braces next week. There’s already pending legislation banning home shipping of AR parts kits.
1754 2018-11-29 11:15:13 U.S. stocks rallied the most in 8 months Wednesday & USD fell after a dovish tone from the Federal Reserve Chairman Powell fueled speculation the central bank is closer than thought, to pausing on interest rate hikes.
1755 2018-11-29 11:14:14 STELLA FACTION stocks rallying
1756 2018-11-29 11:14:10 I have talked about USD 40 WTIC in the past quite a few times. Let us see what is in store. Simple logic demands all the retail investors who are committed and fully exposed to Oil stocks have to be squeezed maximum by MMs, just what is happening in PM stocks so far.
1757 2018-11-29 11:14:06 i saw a lot of wanna one ghana chocolates, yo-hi biscuits and yo-hi water back in january when i went to a korean grocery, and then i went there again a while ago and it seems like no one really buy the stocks there nfjvnf :<
1758 2018-11-29 11:13:50 This is great don't get me wrong, but it doesn't seem to mention what would happening you don't turn in the bump stocks... This is a regulation only, so does it have much power? Step in the right direction at least

1760 2018-11-29 11:12:31 Thank you for your work! I am currently in Swizerland there is options like etoro, but no BTC deposit possibility, and I am currently holding my "free" money on binance and bitmex, and very interested in trading stocks...
1761 2018-11-29 11:11:22 Just concerned why you force those who wish to buy/refill keg barrels to also purchase spirits? At the outlet point drinkers of keg are not forced to buy spirits! Or is it just a case of dumping stocks at the consumer point?
1762 2018-11-29 11:10:53 . Gradually the stocks of limejuice with the other shopkeeper were finished. They began to direct their customers to me.

1764 2018-11-29 11:09:23 Hi! As of now there's none. We're waiting for masternim to reply if she has some stocks.
1765 2018-11-29 11:09:18 On a day when Nifty is up 130 points, just 2 stocks on NSE hit 52w highs as opposed to 101 stocks that hit 52w lows. A/D ratio is 1:1 which is low considering the large gains in frontline names. Till the time breadth doesnt improve, I am cautious on the market
1766 2018-11-29 11:08:48 Granted. Hey, let's talk about all the other companies who have used that lovely tax windfall you gave them to buy back their own stocks, stash a bit more cash, and delight upper crust investors. That thar trickle down ain't happenin', ya know?

1775 2018-11-29 11:04:31 I think the average Londoner would support trebucheting just for people who walk slowly. If a mayoral candidate really wants to cut through they'll have to promise the return of the stocks followed by exile to Kent for muggers
1776 2018-11-29 11:04:10 I recall the NRA was ok with getting rid of bump stocks

1780 2018-11-29 11:01:02 I do believe there is a FED put, but not at these levels.  Why would you use a powerful tool in you arsenal such as rate cuts for a measly few percentage point fall in stocks.  The credit market is weakening, but still not at levels you would be too concerned with
1781 2018-11-29 10:59:44 We still have to be onhand stocks for the Moving ears bunny hat, if di na kayo makapaghintay for the batch 2, pwedeng bumili kayo pag nagkaonhand na kami next next week nga lang hehe

1783 2018-11-29 10:58:37 Let's face it. The Fed Reserve chief is a wall street puppet. So go long on stocks. He won't allow the stock market to crash by keep increasing interest rates. $aapl, $amzn, $nvda, $crm, $ge. Trump-Jingping summit at #G20 is the one to watch.

1793 2018-11-29 10:50:29 The monthly bonus, that had no guaranteed % payout, was absorbed into the FTers new hourly wages at max possible payout.  And, while those free stocks had potential for greatness, they too didn't actually guarantee $.  Cash awards for anniversaries replaced the RSUs...

1833 2018-11-29 10:14:55 Yep, they chip away at the 2nd amendment-with something that most don't care about (bump stocks).  Once we accept it they move to the next thing-before you know it, bam!  Just like twitter picking off the conservatives one at a time.

1854 2018-11-29 10:02:35 same to me. I will enjoy the relief until Christmas 2018 and deload exaggerated prices of single stocks....
1855 2018-11-29 10:01:48 Why is this important? To me, relative return is the important measurement. Ex. Bonds Vs stocks, what strategy gives you the best return relative to others, given your risk profile? The rest feels like noise and out of my hands

1859 2018-11-29 09:54:24 Well done. I love how both sides are presented and the overriding reason for eliminating bump stocks, because they turn "guns into machine guns." Also love how owners have 90 days to destroy or turn over their devices. 
1860 2018-11-29 09:53:37 It's even funnier when folks realise that in order to sell stocks on the stock market, someone has to want to BUY them :D

1866 2018-11-29 09:48:23 I never stated that, I stated I don’t give two hearty shits about bump stocks, don’t own one and don’t want one. Period
1867 2018-11-29 09:48:17 Do you not remember what I said they are crap. But it's the point bc the next shooting after bump stocks are ban then they will say we need to ban this weapon now. It's bullshit, even though I would never buy a bump stock I'm tired of the argument about guns. They're not the prob
1868 2018-11-29 09:48:02 Stocks rally after dovish comments from the Fed eased worries about U.S. monetary tightening and economic slowdown
1869 2018-11-29 09:46:29 correct! But a stop of rising short term interest rates and later a u-turn in US-rates will boost the dividend aristocrats. By this vision I have no growth and no tech stocks, but I still have many boring stocks like KHC (pretty soon I upload GIS) and Royal Dutch ...
1870 2018-11-29 09:46:22 Same is the case for Indian WB stock ... Ppl becoming too possessive on stocks compared to owners / promoters ....

1873 2018-11-29 09:44:08 Reminder to @realDonaldTrump that Americans do not care about stock market:

Top 10% of Americans own 84% of stocks.

Middle 40% of Americans own only 16% of stocks.

Bottom 50% of Americans own no stocks at all.

Please stop talking about stocks, sir, nobody cares.
1874 2018-11-29 09:43:34 Look how they stole so much money over the war between England and France claiming they lost the way so that everyone would cash in their stocks and they could  buy them for less than a penny on the dollar! What fraudsters!
1875 2018-11-29 09:43:18 Yes! US 10y back down to 3% and stocks rallied hard. 

Well that was a short tightening cycle.
1876 2018-11-29 09:42:56 Well the canister on the ground is the newer CS gas and the one they held up in photos later of a different color is older so where did that one come from?  Are they also popping off older stocks or is it left there on the beach since the 96 or so incidents under the Obama admin?

1968 2018-11-29 08:42:18 Yeah same. It's only negative to push games like this. Both for stocks and both for fans. You lose both when doing this.

1983 2018-11-29 08:30:08 Easy calculation:

You get 80.000 USD in base salary + 100.000 USD in stock. In Germany you pay ~50% income tax on both, in other countries you pay *significantly* less on stocks. Hence, German startups have a huge disadvantage to attract top talent. Got it?

1986 2018-11-29 08:25:33 Oh and banning bump stocks will just prove that it doesnt work anyway. People who want one will get it in the black market.
1987 2018-11-29 08:24:41 what? I don't care about bump stocks.
They're not guns and banning them isn't infringing on the #2ndAmendment.

However it is stupid to ban them. Someone can just as easily use a stick for the same effect; or modify a regular stock if they wish to have a bump stock.

2040 2018-11-29 07:33:46 "Low volatility stocks (dividend aristocrats among others) relative valuation has surged" es un hecho. El mercado ha primado ese tipo de acciones, aumentando su PER relativo respecto a lo usual. Que esto sea sostenido o haya reversión a la media en el futuro sí es opinable.

2058 2018-11-29 07:19:44 Powell didn't change one bit. It has always been Dec. then we will see. He said we were near neutral, but not that he would stop at neutral. Supporting stocks with monetary policy is the ultimate stupidity, so not a surprise you are for it.

2064 2018-11-29 07:15:33 People who actually know something know that bump stocks aren't necessary for bump firing. It's like outlawing training wheels to prevent people from learning to ride bikes. You only make it *slightly* more difficult. Reality is, most won't risk ruining a gun bump-firing anyway.

2070 2018-11-29 07:07:55 275 or 2750 is definitely a target - then you could see a rally upto 2800.. Stocks are oversold and there is too much negativity. So these are good times to trade high volatile and also oversold stock.. We like $SSO, $SPY, $IWM and $QQQ.
2071 2018-11-29 07:07:44 No big deal. A thumb & belt loop is all you need. And, if what I've heard is true, it isn't that difficult to do even without using the thumb/belt loop method.

2104 2018-11-29 06:38:53 I can’t believe you said that!
You should be put In the stocks and have rotten produce hurled at you until you apologize to me personally
2105 2018-11-29 06:38:28 Not at all. The idea is to let employees financially participate in the success of a company. Right now that’s limited due to taxation issues. Working for a US startup means more income for an employee because of lower taxes on stocks.
2106 2018-11-29 06:38:20 Please, that logic is thoroughly flawed. If someone wants to hurt others should we give him the best possible opportunities for doing so or limit them somewhat?
No one need semiautomatic rifles, bump stocks or large magazines. It’s even shitty for self defense.
2107 2018-11-29 06:37:51 @realDonaldTrump I can’t believe you are going to make a federal law to banned bump stocks from law abiding citizens!  Bad people will find other way to use a different item to make a bump stock, Mr. President.

Crypto market bubble is/was the speculative froth at the top of the overall debt bubble. I am wondering if the crypto crash might preceed a similar move in the stock/bond market.

Smart money exiting stocks will act similarly to ICOs selling ETH.

2140 2018-11-29 06:15:06 Bump stocks on rifles, which make up for small percentage of gun related deaths to begin with, isn’t going to do much to gun related deaths, simply because rifles aren’t used much to begin with. 

You people don’t really match logic up to statistics do you?

2152 2018-11-29 06:09:10 They always talk about the FAANG stocks and Amazon or Apple. A 20 yr old student from Cambodia or a guy with a smart phone sitting in a village in Kenya can not buy Amazon stock, but they can buy a few dollars of Bitcoin.

People will not buy clothes or expensive items online, or use their CC online.

2222 2018-11-29 05:30:00 I lost a shitpot of money on my 401K when this peckerhead was in office, so I don't know where he comes off making the claim that stocks were better when he was president. Give me a fucking break.
2223 2018-11-29 05:28:41 It’s a joke of a solution, but the NRA has given up about the bump stocks, I think.

2225 2018-11-29 05:27:44 Like banning bump stocks does anything.....smh
First of all it’s impossible to aim while using a bump stock!

2227 2018-11-29 05:25:20 Traitor? That’s a little far-fetched. Just don’t see why private citizens should own bump stocks; just as they shouldn’t own missile launchers or tanks.

2237 2018-11-29 05:19:00 Bump stocks don't kill people. Bumps do.
2238 2018-11-29 05:18:53 Favorite WSJ article topic is showing poor performance of investment professionals.  Lots of caveats here.  Time frame is short, long bond index returned over 7% (vs. 4% if the study included the year prior), and non-US stocks lagged US by 10% annually (study only used S&P 500).

2240 2018-11-29 05:18:41 Liberal news outlets are purposely reporting this inaccurately to make it appear as if Trump will confiscate all bump stocks. This only applies to new purchases.
2241 2018-11-29 05:18:26 Still stocks have done well in this , In green in recent buys
2242 2018-11-29 05:18:20 Business advice is often total crap, but what I do know is that don't play the penny stocks..
2243 2018-11-29 05:18:19 "Under the new rule, bump stock owners would be required to destroy or surrender the devices to authorities. Members of the public will be given 90 days to turn in or otherwise discard their bump stocks, according to a source familiar with the final rule."
2244 2018-11-29 05:18:18 Buy Fertilizer is not a good idea though the stocks are attractive. The profit purely depends upon Govt decisions
2245 2018-11-29 05:17:33 Oh that's a good point. In my head, comparisons of speed are always ratios. How much faster invokes and answer like 2x faster rather than 2 stocks/minute faster or whatever. Ratio makes more sense in this context

2249 2018-11-29 05:15:57 I read it perfectly. The post you was commenting on was drawing a comparison between your position bump stocks and other such gun related topics. By admitting 1-2 was correct you admitted you are fine with those bans, including a ban on AR-15's. AR-15's are semiautomatic.

2260 2018-11-29 05:10:40 Good question. It actually did at one point. In simple terms, that's was back in 2015 and beginning of 2016 when GM paid back all the government bailout (partially loan n stocks buyout) w full interests. The government sold all the stocks, and now the government owns 0% of GM.

2264 2018-11-29 05:06:22 Let’s start with the “60/40” benchmark. Whose endowment equity allocation is 100% us large cap stocks? And fixed income... 100% long term bonds? So great cherry picking asset classes after the fact. The calc of portfolio returns is dubious at best as has been already pointed out.

2266 2018-11-29 05:04:35 Totally agree with u Raviji..
But there r many stocks which R fundamentally extremely strong but r suffering 2 gain.. 
Sometimes we need 2 think practically..
No 1 can say what could be d bottom 4 any stock.. but if we can find lower levels I think we should wait 4 it..
2267 2018-11-29 05:03:08 I actually didn’t notice until I scrolled down on the stocks app I was surprised to see 180 when it had been 235 or something so I started reading why! 
2268 2018-11-29 05:03:02 It should be illegal for companies to buy back their own stock. It was illegal. Because when times are tough they have no ability to endure in a down market. 80% of stocks are owned by less than 1% of stock owners.

2271 2018-11-29 05:01:13 I don't care about the bump stocks themselves, I don't think I'd ever buy one, but this really pisses me off. This is moving things in the wrong direction, and like you said, the gun control crowd didn't even have to push for this.
2272 2018-11-29 05:01:03 Thanks Jason,  I’m definitely trying to be more selective and patient lately with small caps stocks.
2273 2018-11-29 05:00:50 Agreed on the predicting thing. I have been moving towards individual company stocks that have lower debt regardless. I figure whatever does come not having a bunch of debt to deal with should help.

2284 2018-11-29 04:51:37 I don’t know how many bump stocks are out there but I suspect that a plan to “confiscate” an item like that just isn’t going to work. Stopping future sales is the best anyone can do.

2301 2018-11-29 04:46:52 Understand your point but fundamental investment means buying stocks at reasonable valuations and not at peak. Still stocks may fall by even 50% but if you sit for 3-5 years, rewards should be good. But, ya, even I am not a fan of 5-10 year investing funda. Times have changed.

2334 2018-11-29 04:23:00 Yeah man, the president who's first instinct is "take the guns first, due process later" and ban bump-stocks obviously has the best intentions for the 2nd amendment.
2335 2018-11-29 04:22:19 My stock market strategy is to buy stocks right after the stock market crashes, and then sell them after the market recovers. This means only leaving my money in the stock market for small amounts of time, getting big returns, and eliminating most of the risk.
2336 2018-11-29 04:20:24 Sure, because making unconstitutional laws from other unconstitutional laws is a good thing. The National Firearms Act specifically defines what a machine gun is. Bump stocks don’t fit that definition. This potential change is unconstitutional and unnecessary.
2337 2018-11-29 04:20:12 Well if anything he can at least trade stocks with it if the opponent is on the last stock

2344 2018-11-29 04:16:10 All these people wanting to ban bump stocks, or slide fire, never even heard the term or knew what it was. All these talking heads claiming that you could turn any gun into a “machine gun”. Yeah right. It’s a technique, not alchemy
2345 2018-11-29 04:15:27 Also, all rubber bands must be confiscated as they can be used just like bump stocks as demonstrated on YouTube.
2346 2018-11-29 04:13:56 It’s not. It’s at 3k USD. I only touch high value stocks now
2347 2018-11-29 04:13:12 We love #STEEL Stocks +++#METAL Stocks too..........................!!!!!

Thinking to buy 10 lac #TATASTEEL .................Let's see !!
2348 2018-11-29 04:12:36 Hey Ron, I have suggested the stocks a few times in here for certain GOP sycophants, plus Trump and family. 
Throwing more than rotten veg and eggs though. 
2349 2018-11-29 04:11:13 Fed statement on interest rates boosted stocks, but not bonds. I'm puzzled.
2350 2018-11-29 04:10:17 Your right! I did make money on stocks when you were in office. Unfortunately it was literally pennies.
2351 2018-11-29 04:09:21 Asian stocks gain after Fed chief hits rate rises may slow
2352 2018-11-29 04:09:11 If trump gets a compromise to give up bump-stocks. Do you think the dems will want more and more and more! Or will they be happy with compromise?
2353 2018-11-29 04:08:31 Sure hope that means the stock market and we’re past the down turns.  Got rid of any FAANG stocks, but still nervous about some others.  I don’t think people understand their 401k’s and I think some brokers try to fool us with their high commission picks.
2354 2018-11-29 04:08:03 Other signs that economy isn't all that great:  Many in society struggle to learn to new technologies that will power our future economy. Housing stocks have been a good barometer of weakness (unable to rise in normalized rate environment). These trends offer profitable trades.
2355 2018-11-29 04:08:02 yup we still do, 4 stocks extra left :)
2356 2018-11-29 04:07:45 Indeeeeed!  The new oil stocks? Haha
2357 2018-11-29 04:07:21 METAL STOCKS firing...
2358 2018-11-29 04:07:13 you are a true inspiration sir..... Since I am in a full time job, can't follow all your ideas. Missing lot of gains.. When u start paid service, will you recommend stocks and long term options as well?
2359 2018-11-29 04:06:43 OK Liberals, did y’all just hear the news? Trump is going to be putting a ban on bump stocks.  Would love to see y’all give him some credit.. I’ll wait
2360 2018-11-29 04:05:31 Leah is a merperson who trades stocks as a hobby.
2361 2018-11-29 04:04:21 @Shadowplay sorry don't have time I am updating 191 stocks i trade.. have a good night and stay bless
2362 2018-11-29 04:04:10 Right.  Stocks are here to stay too, even in a bear market.  Bears are here to stay in a bull market and bulls in a bear market.   So?
2363 2018-11-29 04:03:50 Supply is supply. Circulating supply is just a made up phrase to show the number the way they want to. It’s called manipulation.  Call it what it is. Try the same thing with “circulating” supply of gold, or dollars, or stocks, bonds.  It doesn’t work does it?
2364 2018-11-29 04:03:45 Indeed :) I used to trade stocks so naturally have loved Crypto for a few years. I think quite a few people around here would do well to study tools such as VWAP. I preach about it all the time for my scalps but no one listens :) Volume Weighted Price, people. Just makes sense.
2365 2018-11-29 04:03:15 Listen here you little piggy! You're going to get out your wallet. You're going to get on my Robinhood account, and you're going to drain your wallet INVESTING WISELY IN DIVERSE STOCKS! And if I see ANY OF THAT CRYPTO SHIT...
2366 2018-11-29 04:03:12 A really, really, small angel. 

I think you're right though. Most bump stocks got lost in one of those global warming/ climate change/whatever floods.
2367 2018-11-29 04:02:27 To be more precise, especially Buy the CF+ non-dividend paying energy stocks.

All are under valued but the street is waiting first for the dividend cut parade which is without doubt coming. Once it starts, explosive rallies will be triggered. But when??

2377 2018-11-29 03:58:58 Bump stocks are stupid toys, but they are not machine guns by the definition in the NFA and thus this is an illegal taking by executive fiat.

They should be restricted by actually legislation.
2378 2018-11-29 03:57:58 Meanwhile General Motors (which you also predicted would go big) will be laying off more than 14,000 workers by the end of 2020 to save face, after being forced to rebuy their own stocks. That blowback is more than double the number of possible steel jobs you're bragging about.
2379 2018-11-29 03:57:21 Heard you were gonna have bump stocks confiscated? Why not just make them@illegal and skip the whole confiscation thing? I don’t like them, don’t own them, and don’t want to own them but kicking peoples doors in and seizing property won’t sit w your base.
2380 2018-11-29 03:57:19 @tamestorm what if they made it so juri only lost her stocks if she cancelled into them on block? Or one stock allowed her to do the move more then once before the need to reload #SFV
2381 2018-11-29 03:57:17 Don't touch my bump stocks thank you very much.
2382 2018-11-29 03:57:07 And apparently people want Trump to make one out of confiscated bump stocks...
2383 2018-11-29 03:55:11 I have mortgaged all my stocks with a bank in order to lock them for 20-30 years. Hence, I can't sell them in any circumstance
2384 2018-11-29 03:54:07 @jimcramer Question from Betsy in Mississippi for Mad Money. What do you recommend we do with the consumer staple stocks like CLX, PG, JNJ, KMB, HSY, etc that have done very well of late? I am a retiree (although I don't look it) and have these stocks for income. Thank you!
2385 2018-11-29 03:53:45 this game is gonna be 4 stocks at this rate lmao
2386 2018-11-29 03:53:25 After listening to your stocks today I’m stock up on putting the clubs down for a little while. I have too become the “golf guy” that only seems to talk and be asked about golf. Still super high on the game but it’ll be nice to do some normal stuff between now and the new year 
2387 2018-11-29 03:53:14 There it was, end of clip.”I’m raising your taxes a couple of percent”. so we have to agree with you that everyone’s stocks were better because of you. I guess we shld thank Trump bc the Stocks are up again! Thank Trump for the new pipe lines too and increased oil production.
2388 2018-11-29 03:52:43 I have no problem with 2A. I also have no problem with banning bump stocks, ARs (even though I have them), tighter controls over who gets a gun. We have no business with 300 million guns in this country. Not when 1 nuke unleashed by 1 crazy president can melt all those guns.
2389 2018-11-29 03:52:25 Watch the Stocks Tank! ;)
2390 2018-11-29 03:51:39 If Trump & Xi get a deal in Argentina, which I'm starting to think they will, stocks could absolutely fly..... insane times
2391 2018-11-29 03:51:31 Wasting so much time in school. If I drop out and run my stocks and business full time I would be filthy rich in a handful of years, but dropping out is looked down upon today
2392 2018-11-29 03:51:25 So Trump gives tax cuts to major corporations, which passed it on to wealthy stockholders, who also got a major tax cuts on their profits from the stocks. #fox2letitrip
2393 2018-11-29 03:51:03 It's kind of pointless to have any documentation online right now cuz it could be changed almost instantly by the AI. All those stocks run on numbers and super computers are really good with numbers

2396 2018-11-29 03:49:41 Hmmm ... Looks like Zimbabwe stocks vs their hyperinflation. I was thinking more of the >99% losses described in the book "Triumph of the Optimists" Germany saw in the 20th century
2397 2018-11-29 03:48:59 Haha, you're saying as if gold or stocks can't be manipulated, in fact, if you put in required amount of money, any asset can be manipulated. But, this effect is more amplified in cryptocurrencies because of low market cap. Wait for more people and more money to flow in.
2398 2018-11-29 03:48:49 BE AWARE: There are trigger devices that will allow rates of fire similar to bump stocks, WITH GREATER ACCURACY.  Don't be put to sleep.
2399 2018-11-29 03:48:25 So wait 50% of Americans don't work for public companies, work for a company or govt that doesnt have an ira or own stocks? Holy cow.
2400 2018-11-29 03:47:50 VWAP is fantastic for stocks! needless to say i realized it works amazingly for crypto as well

2403 2018-11-29 03:44:21 Asian Stocks Follow Wall Street Up, Trade Uncertainty Remains
2404 2018-11-29 03:43:44 1. they're stupid, silly toys for dumping large amounts of disposable income into junk cars & the like
2. truth is that bump stocks probably *saved* lives in LV (increased muzzle climb sent more rounds harmlessly overhead & rate of fire set off the smoke alarm alerting police)
2405 2018-11-29 03:43:38 I think it comes mostly from tail risk.  You're comparison between the two is like comparing buying stocks without margin and stocks with 1% margin.  The risks or rewards are magnified, so caution should be magnified.  One way to do this is to treat the embryo as a patient.
2406 2018-11-29 03:42:46 More in 1913 than in 1923, and it was harder to diversify outside German stocks and bonds then than it is today, but the shift from land to paper wealth was already well underway. We all hope not to be there next Germany, but key to remember what they considered "safe" assets
2407 2018-11-29 03:41:21 It will crash not because of the stocks but because we have inflated the dollar so much that the currency the market is based on will be worthless
2408 2018-11-29 03:41:21 Where stocks are now is because of DJT!! NOT the prior president.  LOL!!
2409 2018-11-29 03:40:38 Oct 24 2016 Stocks where down at 18,223 points.. since Trump has took an office Stocks skyrocketed! Thats called winning for you people brainwashed by CNN
2410 2018-11-29 03:40:15 #marketoutlook for 29/11/2018 : Nifty 80 points gap up opening following big rally in US markets. Asian markets are positive but off from day highs. A sustained move above 10760 in Nifty may take it higher towards 10850 levels. OMC's, metal stocks look good for long trade.

2412 2018-11-29 03:39:48 One praise I can level at Ultimate is the AI is a lot smarter. It doesn't have perfect counters and it doesn't always try to be on the same platform as you (which was easy to use as bait). It does complex combos, it tries to fuck you on ledges, it tries to suicide last stocks.

2414 2018-11-29 03:39:16 I'll be honest , I really thought shorting stocks, especially low floaters with SSR triggered was an avoid. I figured this was shit that you all learned in the first 6 months of trading. How anyone could still be doing this years into their career is a complete mind fu*k to me

2420 2018-11-29 03:35:20 To top it off I’m making money in stocks. God keep this energy on me for the rest of my life and my family and friends.
2421 2018-11-29 03:34:00 I am only 8% down this year.
So I can say I have been prudent in investing in stocks & mutual funds
2422 2018-11-29 03:33:52 From my understanding, the refineries in California and the Gulf coast prefer heavier crude feeds like we make in Ab, of which we have a glut. So they sell their lighter crude stocks to buy ours but I'm probably missing some stuff here.

2427 2018-11-29 03:30:42 Good thought but stocks have an intrinsic value. I was working with the FDIC and NY Fed in putting the system back together Apple that had been declining. I looked at the company numbers, gave them a price. The stock landed at that price. I don’t see a crash now.

2439 2018-11-29 03:20:13 modification he had done. 

Slowing the rate of fire to something we’ve already agreed on is not the first step toward tyranny. It’s a compromise we’ve already made. Also, as a person who shoots, bump stocks make the rifle wildly inaccurate and there’s no real practical advantage

2463 2018-11-29 03:09:12 Arrogant, ignorant #POS. A “community organizer” that never really had a job is now telling us he’s responsible for oil stocks? Did he forget that the Fed propped up his economy with QA? I’m sure he a dumbed down explanation.
2464 2018-11-29 03:08:28 @IngrahamAngle Obama's taking credit for the stock market's rise is ridiculous. Fed Chief Bernanke said he was going to deliberately lower rates to near zero so that savers would take their money out of banks and put into stocks, boosting markets & creating "Wealth Effect."
2465 2018-11-29 03:07:34 On the "Animal Spirits" #podcast, @awealthofcs and @michaelbatnick say strategies that COULD go to zero are gambling rather than investing - wonder what they would have recommended to the average German 100 years ago, since when both bonds and stocks lost over 99%
2466 2018-11-29 03:07:20 Not sure, but back in March Trump tweeted his intent to ban bump stocks.
2467 2018-11-29 03:06:30 Heh not sure what you mean.  I think tesla going to crash, as well as quite a few other stocks.  But thats going to be put on hold for a while I think.  I was being sarcastic in last post it doesn't always show on the internet
2468 2018-11-29 03:06:29 curious what you expect from portis? feels like him and parker will cannibalize each other’s stats, plus portis isn’t a stocks guy to begin with

2479 2018-11-29 02:58:29 I spend the better part of a day building a gigantic hotel I called The Hotel Sexford. It had a reception area, rooms, a decked out bar, a shopping floor, a lounge floor, and, in the penthouse, a sex dungeon. The stocks really came in handy for that floor.

2484 2018-11-29 02:54:02 You are correct.  However,  it makes no difference. A firing pin can be altered to do the same. I don't support a ban because they will not stop at bump stocks.  These people thing AR stands for assult rifle.  Its not a gun problem.  Its a heart problem.  Here is why:
2485 2018-11-29 02:53:14  *Stocks to watch for*

Hotel Leela Venture: Leela Suitor is said to plan overseas expansion for Indian chain if its bid is successful. (Positive)

Nestle India: to consider interim dividend on Dec. 3. (Positive)
2486 2018-11-29 02:52:47 Lol you only pay capital Gaines in certain things shares, stocks, real estate. So no you don’t necessary need to pay capital gains

2493 2018-11-29 02:50:25 It’ll lessen incidents caused by bump stocks for sure.
2494 2018-11-29 02:50:17 Yes. It's even easier when you're selling vertical spreads. Much higher capital efficiency than selling stocks or naked options. The risk-defined part is a bonus
2495 2018-11-29 02:50:15 For sure. Look what an insane outlier US stocks were over that period. Any diversification away would have been extremely punitive.
2496 2018-11-29 02:50:01 tell me again which crimes were performed by bump stocks?
2497 2018-11-29 02:49:41 Universal background checks, registry of guns, waiting period, bans of accessories that are unnecessary for average use like bump stocks and hi-cap mags. Mandatory safety classes, requirements for storage ect
2498 2018-11-29 02:49:16 Guess that's another promise broken. All the companies took the tax break and put it to invest in there own stocks. It explains the stock market boom and now GM ditching the factories. Add to that the problems Trump's tariffs have caused and we are set for another crash.
2499 2018-11-29 02:48:31 The confiscation is stupid.  If he wants to ban the sale, that's fine, but every person who has bump stocks right now has committed no crimes with them - in fact only one shooting involves them.  Anyone who has nefarious motives isn't turning them in.
2500 2018-11-29 02:47:36 Homework after market. Have a shortlist of 300 tradeable stocks. Create watchlists of those forming bullish patterns in weekly daily intraday time frames. When market is open just flick through them looking for trades. Only takes a few seconds to screen snap and post one
2501 2018-11-29 02:47:13 Aren't bump stocks practically a meme anyway?
2502 2018-11-29 02:46:57 I would add $EVSV $HEMP that way you could diversify with some utility stocks. $HEMP is becoming a big player and $EVSV is at the beginning of some big runs.
2503 2018-11-29 02:44:45 that`s why "PREDATOR" lawyer Mastronardi, gave my sister and I a shoe box with our mothers supposed remains cremated. Wonder what he did with her Stocks and Cash Six years now and hasn`t read her will ?? or returned calls
2504 2018-11-29 02:44:33 "Members of the public will given 90 days to turn in or discard their bump stocks." Or be charged with illegal possession should you continue to own one and didn't get "the memo" ? So punish law abiding citizens because the law was changed after the legal purchase.
2505 2018-11-29 02:44:33 Google finance. Worked well before - they took the portfolio feature and made it social by asking us to “follow” stocks! Huh??
2506 2018-11-29 02:44:28 From 2009 through 2016, these endowment funds returned an average of 6.7% annually, compared with 12.2% for U.S. stocks, 10.5% for a 60/40 mix of stocks and bonds, and 8% for U.S. Treasurys
2507 2018-11-29 02:42:58 ambal mo damu ka stocks sa balay nyu hahahaha
2508 2018-11-29 02:42:24 You would pay lower taxes if we taxed investments higher. Right now investments are taxed a fraction of what income is.And the best stocks are too expensive for ordinary Americans to hold.That can change. And if kids can’t go to college they can’t even enter the race to get rich.
2509 2018-11-29 02:42:23 Nice! Only psychopaths own bump stocks
2510 2018-11-29 02:41:56 Who cares about bump stocks when your boss is caving yet again on funding for the border wall. Let him know, his base is turning.  At least the people I know and places I have visited.  Fool me once, shame on me, fool me 4 times, shame on you.  Empty Threats Trump won’t win 2020.
2511 2018-11-29 02:41:39 @cem_cem not sure sir. Shipping stocks disappointed this year
2512 2018-11-29 02:39:55 Bump stocks suck, lose accuracy and the firing speed increase is minimal. The problem is as we learned in CT after Sandy Hook, if you give an inch gun grabbers take a mile.
2513 2018-11-29 02:39:16 He must be tired of driving U-Haul trucks, or maybe he has stocks? Can't imagine moving that many times times... ;)
2514 2018-11-29 02:39:02 Sell the bike and smartphone. Put all the cash into Pot stocks. Boom. Rich.
2515 2018-11-29 02:38:56 IMO, there is still much we don’t know about that night. Also, some have said that if the shooter had not had the bump stocks he could have killed more people. Bump stocks make the gun inaccurate and overheated.

Just another run of the mill day in the twilight zone.
2518 2018-11-29 02:38:05 I was talking to someone about stocks and I asked them “so if you’re not investing in stocks what are you investing in right now?”
“Something more important”
“like what?”
“Myself”
2519 2018-11-29 02:37:48 What two stocks?
2520 2018-11-29 02:36:46 Thanks Brad..nice to know someone knows stocks..all I know is since @POTUS  we have been able to build a huge garage and helped our Grand kids take trips and so much more just on our interest this past year!
2521 2018-11-29 02:36:45 Agreed. The horses are already out of the barn, however even as gun owner I’ve never liked these devices that skirt the letter of the law. Bump stocks, Gatling trigger cranks, etc. serve no reasonable purpose.

2528 2018-11-29 02:31:55 So what do you like in natty stocks?
2529 2018-11-29 02:31:25 Yes, or no.

Remember 2000 and 2008-2009?  

People made millions of shorting tech stocks in 2000=2002 and shorting bank stocks and sub-primes and all commodities in 2008.

So timing is everything.
2530 2018-11-29 02:30:17 The #market is ticking upwards, and there are still tons of big name stocks like #AAPL trading as close to their intrinsic value as they have in the last year! Blue Chip Stocks are on sale right now. 
2531 2018-11-29 02:30:10 Despite the uncertain future of bump stocks and despite the fact that I don’t think that it’s a good idea to get rid of bump stocks, I still support President @realDonaldTrump. I urge President @realDonaldTrump to keep bump stocks of he can.
2532 2018-11-29 02:30:02 First they came for the bump stocks...
2533 2018-11-29 02:29:54 Good information. Thanks. You are making a “slippery slope” argument, which is common, and useful in many debates. Give them the bump stock &they’ll grab the AR. 
My argument is in the low rate of usage of the device. 
Ultimately, very few bump stocks would turn up. #IrishBoycott
2534 2018-11-29 02:29:37 These hindsight drafts are dumber than reviewing what stocks you should have bought 20 years ago. Dumb.
2535 2018-11-29 02:29:21 Bump stocks are a way around the law. As I  own a gun with one installed, it is basically an automatic, they should be banned. Just my opinion.
2536 2018-11-29 02:29:13 Regulate WALL ST. STOCKS, ETC. Its manipulation for profits. And it messes with the whole country's economy. Just like it happened in 2008 bc of deregulation
2537 2018-11-29 02:29:13 Sorry to hear that happened. My folks would've placed me stocks in the public square (if we had them). Can't fathom being a teacher in today's schools, so thank you for persevering and helping shape lives. #YouRock

2539 2018-11-29 02:28:06 @realDonaldTrump Is it TRUE? 
@RealSaavedra BREAKING: Trump admin plans to announce a bump stock ban that would require bump stock owners to destroy or surrender the devices to authorities. Members of the public will be given 90 days to turn in or discard their bump stocks. -CNN
2540 2018-11-29 02:28:04 This isn't about tariffs. GM got their tax breaks saved a huge tax and now to make the profit even higher nothing makes stocks go up as layoffs. And the so called blame game starts Trump GM pointing fingers yet both profiteering off of this tragedy. Long live capitalist subsidy.
2541 2018-11-29 02:27:30 This is a massive policy overreach and hopefully will be struck down by SCOTUS.

I don't even care all that much about bump stocks per se, but the government has no business telling us what metal or plastic accessories we can attach to our firearms.

This IS the slippery slope.
2542 2018-11-29 02:26:55 Ao you can buy used bump stocks? Say at gun shows? Shocking
2543 2018-11-29 02:26:40 Fuck! What In The Fuck! They make the Apple iPhones and Apple *HIC* Apple equipment. But getting rid of the bump stocks.
2544 2018-11-29 02:26:14 They are all hills to die on.  "Well, you didn't mind when bump stocks were banned.  Why should you care about 30-round magazines?"
2545 2018-11-29 02:26:09 Im still bullish DXY and bearish the long bond even though I think the short end rallies and stocks struggle
2546 2018-11-29 02:25:46 So now everyone knows waay more about bump stocks (sarcasm). Than the asshole formerly known as Stephen paddock.  Hm, weird.
2547 2018-11-29 02:25:38 Personally I'd probably put enough to live on/for emergencies in annuities, and then play with the rest in a diversified portfolio of venture investment, real estate, and stocks.
2548 2018-11-29 02:25:25 Sir, checked this strategy yesterday and it worked superbly on Dabur and Bata India.

2551 2018-11-29 02:22:37 US stocks surged overnight, spurred by a remarks from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell who said he considers the central bank's benchmark interest rate to be near a neutral level — an important distinction from remarks he made less than two months ago.

2554 2018-11-29 02:21:42 What it does is to reclassify weapons with bump stocks as the equivilent to automatic weapons.  Meaning, unless you have a higher classification of license to purchase such weapons, they would be illegal.

2557 2018-11-29 02:20:45 IMO bump stocks are not the hill to fight on.

Plus, it takes that talking point away from the gun grabbers.

We need to defend semi-autos with detachable magazines - both rifles and handguns.  That is the real next goal of the gun control movement.

2559 2018-11-29 02:20:02 That said, all confiscation will do is:
1) Generate a run on bump stocks
2) Probably drive it underground
2560 2018-11-29 02:20:01 Yeh I’m sure the criminals with bump stocks will get right on that. Smh.
2561 2018-11-29 02:19:05 I think he'd be weeping about a lot more than bump stocks.
2562 2018-11-29 02:18:27 Yaa.. i think all websites wanna play safe and not having many stocks because they thought not many would buy them
2563 2018-11-29 02:18:18 Bump stocks are stupid and make your rifle inaccurate anyway.  I have never and would never use one.

2566 2018-11-29 02:15:46 Kieran, your knowledge on stocks would be better than mine. Let's say a company is floated and say you're a major shareholder. Hypothetically, if the company makes you sign a contract stating that you can't sell for a year, these shares would still be included in MC right?
2567 2018-11-29 02:15:38 What we need are more good guys with bump stocks. Right joe?
2568 2018-11-29 02:15:27 Machineguns are still legal to own. But criminal use of them declined to almost zero ever since the days of Al Capone, when the fed made it mandatory to register them and pay a tax on them each year. That would be a viable option for the bump stocks without making them illegal.
2569 2018-11-29 02:14:45 I concur. Bump stocks are garage.
2570 2018-11-29 02:14:40 i'm completely serious, you want to make money easy and morally? join the white house press corps and short stocks before asking trump about them
2571 2018-11-29 02:14:20 Irony

Trump and the Whitehouse announce a plan to ban bump stocks 
Trumps gonna take maga guns.
2572 2018-11-29 02:13:51 Years ago, when I first saw a video of these stocks (before they became as popular as they are now), I thought "There's no way that these things will ever be able to be sold... they must be illegal." Even as a 2A supporter, I see these as just a workaround to make a semi an auto.

2590 2018-11-29 02:01:15 Okay here is an observation.#Chinese stocks are mostly today xo above 10sma daily. some are already above and few small ones are almost there. $YINN above 10sma and 50sma, $YANG opposite.#Dovish #G20 coming up like #Powell today. $BABA $BIDU $NTES $JD $IQ $BZUN #Nargis07 $SPY
2591 2018-11-29 02:01:10 Why do government have to do anything?  Global warming & climate change means fish stocks (shark food) have also moved.  End result, sharks don't have good eyesight and we look like food. Best answer - get out of their environment, especially when we know of other local attacks
2592 2018-11-29 02:01:06 European stocks mostly fell on Wednesday as optimism over progress on trade at the G20 faded.
2593 2018-11-29 02:00:56 Does one need to be accredited for this?  Is it only for Canadian citizens? Any such opportunities with other uranium stocks? Thanks.
2594 2018-11-29 02:00:20 So they aren't detectable by NSA scans?  I'm thinking of investing in stocks and if bump stocks are banned, they may becaome more valuable.  I'll look into it.
2595 2018-11-29 01:59:49 Ya because the earlier sell off has really high volume. But both had the highest volume in November though. Besides, more eyes are on tickers like banks and tech stocks today.
2596 2018-11-29 01:59:43 Notice he wasn't taking credit for stock market lows in past few weeks. Stocks were up today ~Que the Talking points on that soon. O is an ignoramist (slang for ignorant ass) 
2597 2018-11-29 01:58:01 That was no ar15 shooting in Las Vegas. There wher to many shots and you couldnt controll the rifles with those stupid stocks. At two of three points during the assault you hear more than one weapon shooting.
2598 2018-11-29 01:57:48 Bump stocks are essentially toys that make it easier to employ physics on semi-auto weapons, but a ban on them is still and infringement on the right of the people to keep and bear arms.
2599 2018-11-29 01:56:58 Could explain all of the hemorrhoids and depleted stocks of anusol
2600 2018-11-29 01:56:47 This would make sense. Give more stocks a chance to set up properly. Less V rally
2601 2018-11-29 01:55:58 While the market is full of opportunities, always set target to achieve. It will be easier to track your progress this way! #PENNYSTOCK #OTCMarkets #money #STOCKS
2602 2018-11-29 01:55:45 “the market is worried about everything...big tech stocks, interest rates increasing, ge, everything, you’ve just got to ride it through. and drink wine.” @SallieKrawcheck

2604 2018-11-29 01:53:29 @ChrisCuomo wow how naive are US folks to excuse this Pres. over and over all in the name of money! Stocks over dignity truth and unity! So sad but scary beyond words! @CNN @CuomoPrimeTime
2605 2018-11-29 01:52:01 I think it’s time to change up 120 black and white film stocks.
2606 2018-11-29 01:51:32 Simply, no. 
45 & #GOP had 2 yrs to do something. They cut taxes to rich & corps who bought back stocks to make execs richer.
Not employees who at best got a bonus not a pay increase. Adding billions to deficit.
Tarrffs are corporate welfare, again not capitalism... It socialism.
2607 2018-11-29 01:51:28 I still get on yahoo finance to read people’s comments like back in the day. Shit is so damn comical  #stocks $SPY $ES_F
2608 2018-11-29 01:50:52 SIGI SAYS: Barring economy collapse w/o stock dump, only if SP hits 2k will QT end and USD sink from continued debt issuance dams USD drainage. Then stocks scream to 3000 and Gold gets a whiff of 70’s inflation. Bonds a crap shoot-spike B4 dump? US is Tallest Pygmy. BOOK IT
2609 2018-11-29 01:50:16 In my opinion bump stocks are just a waste of ammo, plus there's more than one way to rapid fire without a bump stock.
2610 2018-11-29 01:49:32 I’d be ok with saying that bump stocks have to have the same licensing as full-auto. 

But this 30 day “you have to destroy yours” is nonsense.
2611 2018-11-29 01:49:04 It was never about banning seldom used bump stocks. Its the vague language used to identify a bump stock. If this bill contains the same vague language leaving any room for interpretation over reach, it won’t pass. Language and interpretation people! 21st century tool 2oppress.
2612 2018-11-29 01:48:31 what is the difference between owning these two stocks
2613 2018-11-29 01:47:59 Bump stocks are not a gun, they are an accessory. Not everything that touches a gun is automatically legal. This will easily pass Constitutional muster.

2615 2018-11-29 01:47:24 STOCKS IN BAN
In Ban: Adan Ent, Adani Power, DHFL
Out of Ban: Jet Air
2616 2018-11-29 01:46:29 Reminiscent of Japan in the 1980s - as is the financial engineering associated with this explosion in corporate debt, with stock buybacks taking the place of keiretsu (the cross-holdings of stocks between Japanese conglomerates of the 1980s).
2617 2018-11-29 01:46:03 yep, now the question. How does crypto do in a recession where housing and stocks are probably falling.
2618 2018-11-29 01:44:11 Now I can say with 100% accuracy Bitcoin is dead.  Why you may ask.  When Money Map Express a penny stock shilling company is advertising it signals the final curtain!  Name 1 just 1 they were correct about!  This is where all stocks etc. go to die!
2619 2018-11-29 01:43:51 I’m about to buy stocks in hot topic too bc they’re about to be loaded, army don’t play
2620 2018-11-29 01:43:15 @smartertrader sam, what a awesome day.  Your levels on so many stocks are ridiculously accurate.  Cmg, nflx, amzn, spx all got crushed.  The logic is spot on.  Thanks for what you do!
2621 2018-11-29 01:42:51 The sound of millions of bump stocks suddenly disappearing in fluke boating accidents?
2622 2018-11-29 01:40:45 I was going to say something but it looks like all of the others have got it covered.  Our jobs here in MO are being outsourced as the company I work for steals from us, the CAF and spends money buying back stocks. There will be no retirement for me.
2623 2018-11-29 01:40:44 No one knows what's at the End of The Line, so we may as well Enjoy The Ride.
2624 2018-11-29 01:40:24 Banning it solves nothing. I learned how to bump fire an AR long before they invented bump stocks. It's no different. This accessory is not the problem at all, but nobody understands that.
2625 2018-11-29 01:40:04 I always try to keep away from the stocks pumped by every recognisable name under the sun. They always end in tears
2626 2018-11-29 01:39:56 Funny that these anchors won’t educate themselves on this market. Seem to literally hate crypto and hope for its demise. Boarderline mocking guests when it’s outperformed most stocks they “closely” track over past few years - even w the crash.
2627 2018-11-29 01:37:15 With just two words on Wednesday, the Federal Reserve’s chairman sent stocks surging by raising hopes that.... wow
2628 2018-11-29 01:37:01 First day with my stocks and I already swung my car 3 times around a corner today 
2629 2018-11-29 01:36:20 ok. I don't buy stocks
2630 2018-11-29 01:36:16 More bump stocks have been sold since  Los Vegas any one who wants one has one. They want mine they can buy it back from me if not easy to resale .if they dont do a buy back they will still be out there for people who want one to get.
2631 2018-11-29 01:35:37 My favorite take is the economist set saying the market misinterpreted Powell. I think that is beside the point. Positioning is everything and positioning was bearish stocks and o/w the USD.
2632 2018-11-29 01:34:53 Bump stocks are gimmicky and gay.

I would never support a bump stock ban because its step closer to banning things that are useful and not gay.

(I know that wasn't the crux of your post. Just saying.)
2633 2018-11-29 01:34:08 If you have a futs datafeed see if you can port it in before paying for it. Tradingview has cheap feed for stocks but the futs are pricey
2634 2018-11-29 01:33:36 Tbh, I will enjoy going to the range more if those yahoos with the bump stocks have to be a little more discreet.
2635 2018-11-29 01:33:34 Got it in one. Public stocks being brought back.
2636 2018-11-29 01:32:55 Banning bump-stocks solves nothing. You were right to call the @POTUS out.
2637 2018-11-29 01:32:49 Hi Bill. Did you enter recently or did you hold from earlier on in the year?

I'm usually shakenout on the last day stocks go down and start to recover...
2638 2018-11-29 01:32:28 Gosh he is nauseating!-The same Bathhouse Bozo who said he wanted gas 2 cost @ least $5 a gallon & the only $$ pepo made during his reign of horror (if not a gubmint boondoggle!)

I had never thought of looking into worthless pieces of shit but your ramping shit stocks does as much damage as those ramping for pumps. You ramp to try get your money back.

2643 2018-11-29 01:31:07 Breck: I am a strong 2nd Amendment supporter. However, I don’t have a problem with eliminating bump stocks. Frankly, I think this is throwing them a meaningless bone. I am concerned about the slippery slope though.
2644 2018-11-29 01:29:44 Okie dokie then. Time to drop GM stocks and buy Ford
2645 2018-11-29 01:29:32 Diversification shouldnt be understood primarily as buying a bunch of different stocks. Rather diversification should be understood as buying different forms of assets. Some diversification within different assets isnt a bad idea, but Buffet suggests placing more eggs in 1 basket

2654 2018-11-29 01:22:04 They could categorize it as an AOW and make it a class 3 weapon that requires a federal permit, but I have no hopes of them being logical.  They will simply decide that bump stocks constitute multiple shots with a single trigger pull
2655 2018-11-29 01:21:59 Thier is nse link , do google.. they are giving list of result stocks
2656 2018-11-29 01:21:04 Because bump stocks are rocket science 
2657 2018-11-29 01:20:50 With no reimbursement? Bump stocks aren’t cheap.

2661 2018-11-29 01:18:54 What about law-abiding gun owners that have to give up their bump stocks now are you backing them too
2662 2018-11-29 01:18:27 Since @POTUS will announce the ban, we now fully expect the media and Democrats to come out in support of everyone's right to own and use bump stocks
2663 2018-11-29 01:18:08 Make them illegal: turn them in or face a federal felony. Every transaction can be traced. The NRA says very few bump stocks are sold every year, should be very easy to collect. Not that many manufacturers.
2664 2018-11-29 01:17:36 Pretty sure all those bump stocks are registered. 
2665 2018-11-29 01:17:20 Is he that stupid? It was him? NO, it was in spite of him. He cut oil, and we drilled on private land.

2675 2018-11-29 01:12:40 Hey bæ  All i want  for Christmas  is stocks 
2676 2018-11-29 01:11:58 bump stocks?  What are those?
2677 2018-11-29 01:11:54 The way you used the stocks in the background is super sweet looking 
2678 2018-11-29 01:11:49 On the record.  When stocks are calculated for market cap it’s done by multiplying outstanding shares by stock price. Outstanding shares are everything, even those held by company execs, with the exception of those bought back by the company.   1/3
2679 2018-11-29 01:11:38 When have bump stocks ever been a problem outside of the one incident...
2680 2018-11-29 01:11:35 That assumes they only used beta products and only owned US stocks / bonds / owned some form of Treasuries that outperformed a normal index by 6% / year IF the numbers are right.
2681 2018-11-29 01:10:18 All wars are profitable to the Corp backers like Raytheon the denfense industry both republicans and democrats welcome their donations .Their stocks zoom when we go to war as does their production of weapons tanks , planes etc .We are constantsly at war for a Corp reason

2686 2018-11-29 01:07:40 Stocks off the list:
GM  & TWTR
2687 2018-11-29 01:06:34 Give up your bump stocks or else
2688 2018-11-29 01:06:27 Best Buy stocks it so I was thinking about trying it out, I need another monitor pretty badly
2689 2018-11-29 01:05:54 This is why I get so mad at people who are happy with Trump because the stock market is doing well. Only half of the American people own any stocks at all, and 84% of them are owned by 10%. They send jobs overseas, but the richest 1% keeps getting richer.
2690 2018-11-29 01:04:18 48 of 110 respondents said the current bull run in global stocks has more than a year to go. About 25% expect it to end within a year, but nearly a third of respondents said the bull market has already ended. - Reuters poll
2691 2018-11-29 01:04:17 Trump supporter here, but do agree... need to rid stocks and all forms of assault rifles. What should stay are pistols and hunting rifles.
2692 2018-11-29 01:04:00 Popcorn stocks are on the RISE!!!!! 
2693 2018-11-29 01:03:10 hooking my dog's electric shock collar up to the dow jones so it goes off every time stocks fall by more than 0.5% to teach it about the economy
2694 2018-11-29 01:02:50 Too bad, bump stocks make firing way less accurate.
2695 2018-11-29 01:02:21 I think bump-stocks are dumb and useless,  but i don't like this. It's over the top. #noconfiscation
2696 2018-11-29 01:01:48 (1/2) Ahead of the discussions, we do have #FOMC minutes. Given today's Powell comments, which were interpreted as dovish, the minutes could reignite hawkish expectations. That would be stocks negative. This translates to #NZDJPY down as it is essentially a pure sentiment FX pair
2697 2018-11-29 01:01:39 Stocks going down. Laying off people gives stockholders a chance to make some money before the stocks crash. They never close because they are supposedly "too big to fail" and the government bails them out with taxpayer money. So their bad practices continue bc they're rewarded.
2698 2018-11-29 01:01:21 Honest question. Are there any sectors for stocks that your models say could be good at this time?
2699 2018-11-29 01:01:12 But my well regulated militia depends upon bump stocks.
2700 2018-11-29 01:01:00 Also, all tradeable stocks operate in this dynamic.

Unless you buy stocks thinking you can somehow spend them.

Nope, the entire purpose is to invest when it is undervalued, and sell when it is overpriced. That's how the market works. And don't get me started on leverage trading
2701 2018-11-29 01:00:51 @BarackObama lol...omg you are so delusional. You can't re-write actions..we know, we were here and you had NOTHING to do with America becoming the largest oil producer. You had NOTHING to do with our stocks, when you left they were bottomed out. Trump fixed all that!! Seek help
2702 2018-11-29 01:00:46 Fellow Texans as a gun rights supporter I’m curious how you feel about reports about admin banning bump stocks. #2A
2703 2018-11-29 00:59:54 Stocks move into & out of key events. Oscillators go from oversold/overbought & reverse. Prices trend &consolidate

Mkt goes from Disbelief, Belief, & Greed; then reverses
Pay attn to sentiment Extremes
Know your timeframe & ride the mkt waves for your plan
Open Mind pays
2704 2018-11-29 00:59:45 Wanna start investing in stocks but I so know little, high time a start putting in the work.
2705 2018-11-29 00:58:50 A fundamental role of the NRA is teaching fire arm safety. They also fight dangerous gun laws, like Obama Admin legalizing bump stocks in 2009,used by the Las Vegas maniac to turn his rifles into machine guns. Soros-Gate's socialist media won't tell you thus.
2706 2018-11-29 00:57:42 In complete agreement. As a gun advocate, I see no reason for bump stocks.
2707 2018-11-29 00:57:41 .@CNN reports that the Trump Administration is close to unveiling regulation that would ban bump stocks. The president has openly opposed bump stocks since the Las Vegas shooting, facing opposition from the NRA and some lawmakers. Article link below:
2708 2018-11-29 00:57:41 Funny, I was just planning a trip across Lake Superior with all my bump stocks. I should be careful though, that boat is in really bad shape...
2709 2018-11-29 00:57:33 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump U SPINELESS PIG, NOW your administration is passing a law against bump stocks. @NRA is losing money, so U grow a pair, SAD
2710 2018-11-29 00:57:30 I have owned too many guns to actually remember.
I have been an avid collector, and shooter, for about 40 years.
I had never even heard of a bump stock, until the Vegas shooting.
I think gizmo's like bump stocks, shouldn't be available in the first place.

2712 2018-11-29 00:56:08 How soon before looney leftists start demanding bump stocks be legalized again? And screaming Trump is a bump stock bigot?
2713 2018-11-29 00:55:46 Betting on blockchain is also investing in Amazon and IBM stocks for sure !
2714 2018-11-29 00:55:10 Yeah right.  After all his TRIBE Members have  STOCKED up the supplies of still legal BUMP STOCKS.  TOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  LATE.
2715 2018-11-29 00:55:02 3 stocks 6 minutes seems good
2716 2018-11-29 00:54:46 News is that a federal regulatory ban on bump stocks is coming in the next few days.

2718 2018-11-29 00:53:19 Was the Fed's announcement re: interest rates a scheduled release? Or was there pressure from the Trump administration? Stocks jumped on the news - who made big money today? Trump's buddies?

2722 2018-11-29 00:51:39 @piersmorgan BREAKING: Trump admin plans to announce a bump stock ban that would require bump stock owners to destroy or surrender the devices to authorities. Members of the public will be given 90 days to turn in or discard their bump stocks. -CNN. Thoughts ?
2723 2018-11-29 00:51:25 Throughout his presidency he blamed bush for everything from banking oil stocks, price of gas. You name it it wasn’t his fault. Now 2 years later he is responsible for the economy’s and oil production. Come on dude

2725 2018-11-29 00:51:09 Prison was popularised by Quakers with deliberate blindness towards human nature.

Lashing, the stocks, exile, and capital punishment have all worked far better than prison.
2726 2018-11-29 00:51:03 BREAKING: Trump administration will ban bump stocks in the coming days. Last year, the Las Vegas gunman rigged his weapons with the devices, killing 58. @cnnbrk
2727 2018-11-29 00:50:46 This year, there have been Rs. 17.3 billion of outflows from stocks and Rs. 118.8 billion from Government securities, the latest data from the bourse and Central Bank data showed.
2728 2018-11-29 00:50:32 No, those don't get registered.

Having said, I think bump stocks are dumb
2729 2018-11-29 00:50:18 Stocks gain, dollar sags on dovish-sounding Fed

2731 2018-11-29 00:49:56 He will open free sale , trump never ban bump stocks if he does will be a betrayal to his base
2732 2018-11-29 00:49:31 Did she admit, under oath, that she voted for Cruz? That might go a long way on sentencing day...

A week in the stocks, maybe? And vouchers, for continuing Ed?
2733 2018-11-29 00:49:06 That’s a bone for the democrats. Like banning a stock will change the world. How many criminal incidents have occurred with bump-stocks?  Vegas, any others?
2734 2018-11-29 00:48:34 So no buying unnecessary album and season greeting (i hope they still have stocks in april though)

2738 2018-11-29 00:47:09 There aren’t too many positive things we can say about the Trump administration but their decision to ban bump stocks really is a huge step in the right direction for once
2739 2018-11-29 00:47:06 Trump admin will ban bump stocks in the coming days. Last year, the Las Vegas gunman rigged his weapons with the devices, killing 59 ppl.
2740 2018-11-29 00:46:23 IDK bout that one chief. People are finding lots of janky stuff and we're day -9 into the game. It'll be very fast paced with the occasional campy my just like Sm4sh. Sm4sh should've been 3 stocks too.
2741 2018-11-29 00:46:17 Cant afford car, but the last stocks that I would sell!
2742 2018-11-29 00:45:53 WASHINGTON: CNN: Trump admin will ban bump stocks in the coming days. Last year, the Las Vegas gunman used it on his weapons, killing 58.
2743 2018-11-29 00:45:39 Banning bump stocks?  They’re so useless anyway. There are many other ways to have the same effect, with better control. @realDonaldTrump you take an L.
2744 2018-11-29 00:44:51 But he probably won’t. We have to share fish stocks, it’s UN law not EU, the EU fisheries quota was just a mechanism to fulfill the international UNCLOS obligation.

2747 2018-11-29 00:44:27 Bump stocks are a sacrificial lamb, and always have been.
2748 2018-11-29 00:44:13 The Trump admin just said that theyll ban bump stocks.... @realDonaldTrump Thank you, I hope more REAL change is coming.
2749 2018-11-29 00:43:18 Where is the outrage. #Trump admin to ban bump stocks.
2750 2018-11-29 00:43:15 Bet all you @NRA @realDonaldTrump fans are pissed he's banning bump stocks!!!!!!!! LOVE IT

2755 2018-11-29 00:40:35 There's no way it should be two stocks.

2759 2018-11-29 00:39:25 Only n*ggers need bump stocks, since they can't focus on one thing at a time.

2762 2018-11-29 00:38:09 So what? Real gun enthusiasts don’t give a shit about bump stocks. They are novelty. Come for my gun or ammo and that’s a different story. POTUS wouldn’t never do that though.

2768 2018-11-29 00:35:27 Checking 3 local news stations at 6pm to see if they mention the gains stocks made today...

30 min news on all channels include...
7 min sports
7 min weather
4 min odd news (like a local school built a mindfulness room)
AND
12 min commercials

No need to mention dow up 600
2769 2018-11-29 00:35:02 Stocks are looking ahead, they are /were expecting maybe them to go higher. If the raises continue for say 24 months at this pace it will start to be a pain in the ass.

On our side the dollar is high and attracting people. But not so hot for a domestic debtor.
2770 2018-11-29 00:34:55 @Bullish_bull stocks poised to break that .33 mark & . Shorts will get out as soon as it clears .33 They will try to short again around 50

Strangely it has curbed teenage drinking dramatically because of fear of public shame and if anything good can come of this sorry affair it will hopefully have the same effect on bullying. I've my fingers crossed.
2776 2018-11-29 00:29:31 Everything is falling apart at the seams.  EA is breaking the law, Activision's stocks are plummeting, and Bethesda is trying to sell you a rusty dinghy that they marketed as a fancy yacht.

2778 2018-11-29 00:27:03 Looks like the market is going to rally back to the mean. That is really good news for stocks. I don't know what is going to actually bring this market down. Probably nothing.

Ask them to stop.
If they don't, refuse to buy whatever you WERE going to buy off them.

2790 2018-11-29 00:17:29 @digitalassetbuy since #xrp is the real deal. AND i heard you can make tokens on the #ripple network. Do you think companies could use this to tokenize stocks or other assets that need to be transferred and owned? Would this drive up the price?

2793 2018-11-29 00:15:02 Tip - Day Trade the same stock(s) all the time. Have one, two, or possibly three stocks you become an expert in.
Run a stock screener each week to find two to four stocks that provide good volume and volatility, and then trade those all week. 
Look for stocks to trade each day.
