4 2018-11-08 23:59:14 I often wonder how tax works with crypto...don't bother googling it ..you will get every kind of answer but the right one. Checked the IRS site and ..maybe I was in the wrong spot but...it was very unclear and more or less said "give us money" without any kind of guidelines ..
5 2018-11-08 23:59:06 you would do better in ltc if you didn't attack bitcoin cash Charlie. You actually turn off people from your LTC. There's nothing wrong with ALL crypto's doing good. The forces we are fighting DEMAND it

14 2018-11-08 23:57:58 The US already dramatically expanded the money supply under Obama during another debt crisis, the GFC. Hyperinflation? Nope. The key is to print just enough to take the edge off bad debt and the contracting money supply. I don't think fiat is doomed. Crypto may perform better.
