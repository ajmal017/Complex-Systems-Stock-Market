41 2018-09-10 23:56:16 You walk in for a $30 dollar oil change you walk out with $200 charge

44 2018-09-10 23:55:44 The explanation will not get the votes in 2019. Cong bought crude oil @ $154 and sold petrol at 56 you are buying $75 per barrel and your price is $80 people will not buy your argument. Will be a disaster for you in 2019.
45 2018-09-10 23:55:37 Neurologist says the tests came back normal so I’m gonna try a new medicine. And when I get migraines I’m gonna see if CBD oil and other related things will help. Might help my anxiety when I get one which would be lovely. Anyways I’m not giving up hope.

47 2018-09-10 23:55:22 Be careful after. Your skin might get easily dry. Make sure to rub olive oil on your body.

49 2018-09-10 23:55:05 No link as it's a modified recipe from a friend; of Hungarian origin.

1 egg
100g spelt flour
100g sugar
1 tsp sodium bicarbonate
100g poppyseed (ground)
50ml coconut oil
200ml sour cream
2 apples (finely grated)

Mix. Bake for 30m at 180C (round tin)

Dust with icing sugar.
50 2018-09-10 23:54:57 Yet big oil got huge tax cuts.  It’s never enough.  Manipulation at its best.

53 2018-09-10 23:54:25 I’ve tried All types of Oil Treatments
I’ve tried almost all of Shea-Mositures Masks 
I’ve tried the whole green house affect with the plastic bag and sleeping over night.
I was doing the LCO method for a while, but by then end of the day I’m back to Brillo pad hair.
54 2018-09-10 23:54:15 Dear Dimwit Socialist,
Do you know what the most efficient, abundant, renewable fuel is? Oil!  Morality?...You have none. Integrity?...You have no idea what it is.

56 2018-09-10 23:54:10 Gotta give another shoutout to my oil change mechanics. They always hook me up with the good windshield wiper fluid that makes the water just bead up

59 2018-09-10 23:54:00 Anyone know what the top offenders are in the oil and gas and coal industry in West Virginia North Carolina and South Carolina? how about corporations which are causing environmental damage? How about military operations? Any corrupt politicians based there? Just wondering?

61 2018-09-10 23:53:40 I'm really bummed out that people read that with ill-intent. As an acne haver I always find it really wonderful and refreshing to hear people say stuff like "You have to see a doctor" as opposed to "Tea tree oil will save your skin!" I really thank you for your honesty.
62 2018-09-10 23:53:21 I don’t think so... living beyond a nations means isn’t a particularly new thing. Oil maybe caused a distortion but that’s still only a piece of the trend. Bitcoin makes next to no sense though.
63 2018-09-10 23:53:15 Is beard oil worth it?
64 2018-09-10 23:53:06 Ok! Recemos para que eso suceda pronto Jajajaja
65 2018-09-10 23:53:04 I can cook, change a tire, do laundry check the oil, iron, put air in the tires, sew on a button, mow the grass, do the dishes, so can my brother, husband & my sons
It's what parents teach their children regardless of their gender when they want them to be self sufficient adults
66 2018-09-10 23:52:51 Me and some people is like oil and water we don't mix... #mrdownforwhatever
67 2018-09-10 23:52:49 Lots of oil to get it started and keep it going. Google it.

69 2018-09-10 23:52:36 For us the 1700 was the first money other than gas and oil change we put into my car in > 2 years so I think an average of ~$100/mo in maintenance is still fair. Just sucks to spend that much cash at one time even though we'd saved for it lol.

71 2018-09-10 23:52:32 For nerve pain, joint pain, arthritis, rheumatism, fibromyalgia, etc you definitely need our Annihilate the Agony massage oil. It is a life saver for many people. 2 oz $--20 4 oz $--35
72 2018-09-10 23:52:20 There is no possible oil deal in Libya outside NOC. French know that and discuss with Sanalla about, not Haftar. Check about meetings b/n Total and NOC.
73 2018-09-10 23:52:20 Learned a new word today describing creepy Pence.  @CNN @washingtonpost describes Pence as “oleaginous” meaning:
1. Rich in, covered with, or producing oil; oily or greasy.
2.exaggeratedly and distastefully complimentary; obsequious.
Fitting description for an odious Trump toady
74 2018-09-10 23:52:19 How does Obama take credit for President Trump repealing Obama’s job killing regulations and giving every American a tax cut? These are the true drivers of growth. Obama’s idea of growth was putting the hard working coal and oil workers in the unemployment line.
75 2018-09-10 23:52:01 I don’t remember that one but Sandy was really bad for some points in NC too, especially soundside, whole villages gone, my grandparent’s near manteo lost like 80 out of 175 houses and some of them that ended up staying just finished rebuilding, this sucks
76 2018-09-10 23:51:59 They say these savages came to burn oil export records & documentation so the men in Armani suits can steal the billion$$ with no accountability

79 2018-09-10 23:51:33 Give him time...He's got to check with the oil lobby and the NRA before he gives you a non-committal, weasely answer.

83 2018-09-10 23:51:17 Well that’s it. The vapo rub and olbas oil are out. Summer is officially over.
84 2018-09-10 23:51:12 Oil. That’s the right answer.
85 2018-09-10 23:51:08 The oil spill that BP ain't clean up
86 2018-09-10 23:51:02 Pagina 11, Hunt Oil, Odebrecht. 40 años depredandonos.
87 2018-09-10 23:51:01 Oh but I’m Conservative. I didn’t buy snake oil in 2016.  Democrats will take over the house. Trump will be lucky to be in his job by 2020. Pence wants it.
88 2018-09-10 23:50:57 That one's a real winner. First time I saw them was replying to a Twitter ad for a flow meter and connecting said meter to Big Oil and spill liability.
89 2018-09-10 23:50:46 Hello i bought a new thing of coconut oil and the best feeling is breaking into that badboy and becoming a living wet noodle
90 2018-09-10 23:50:41 So hot that I have to keep the peanut butter and nutella in the refrigerator to keep the oil from separating
91 2018-09-10 23:50:28 涼しいって素晴らしいな
92 2018-09-10 23:50:17 the oil pen is prolly one of the best inventions of the 21st century
93 2018-09-10 23:50:15 Love how coconut oil takes off makeup 
94 2018-09-10 23:50:14 Great point. I noticed that as well, also the eating establishments in all prices ranges busy. Texas did a great job diversifying and not relying heavily on oil, although still important, not their only industry.
95 2018-09-10 23:50:11 We are praying  
96 2018-09-10 23:50:01 And yet propaganda like democracy is in danger in Iran, a much freer place than Saudi. Due to oil dependence and fear of chaos west is tolerating an intolerant, global Salafi terror financing networks( to keep them away from kingdom) regime. We muslims must force Saudis to reform
97 2018-09-10 23:49:58 $100 Oil change + Transmission fluid change on hondas, HMU!!
98 2018-09-10 23:49:54 More truthfully, a snake oil salesman of her time. Or is it patent medicine? Either way, it's useless or even harmful crap.
99 2018-09-10 23:49:53 @josie_maran Hi Josie! I was wondering if you might consider packaging your Whipped Argan Oil Ultra-Hydrating Body Butter in a large pump bottle. Sound possible?! Love and hugs
100 2018-09-10 23:49:42 chop them into tiny pieces crank up the heat with olive oil and they cook wicked fast, I love them
101 2018-09-10 23:49:22 "I vape now but HOL'UP LEMME EXPLAIN" Lmaoooo I wanna try CBD oil too but I live in Texas

103 2018-09-10 23:48:48 Rub oil till they come off
104 2018-09-10 23:48:46 The benchmark for price is set in USD. That’s not necessarily the currency used to purchase it. Canada doesn’t sell China oil for USD. Why would we? We don’t export corn to Europe for USD either. We don’t need the USD. 

This only applies to sovereign currencies.
105 2018-09-10 23:48:36 Me vs forgetting to turn my Bluetooth off when I get my oil changed and Taylor Swift automatically playing any time they turn on my car.
106 2018-09-10 23:48:05 Hank, maybe you should write why there won’t be a rebuild. It’s called greed. The hundreds of owners of the Giants want the money to keep rolling in, so they force front office to sell season ticket holders snake oil. I think that’s run it’s course.

109 2018-09-10 23:47:25 Blend using a stick blender or mash really well together:

-1 ripe avocado
-a good glug of olive oil
-dash of lemon juice
-garlic of some form (grated/paste/granules)
-pinch of salt+pepper
-pinch of chilli flakes (optional)

Mix into cooked pasta. Enjoy!
110 2018-09-10 23:47:16 Try to name any errand worse than getting your oil changed/any type of car service. I dare you.
111 2018-09-10 23:47:08 I put tea tree oil on my face for the first time, so naturally I expect to wake up with clear skin tomorrow
112 2018-09-10 23:47:06 Ooh, sorry to be redundant.
If you find the oil's too strong alone, mix with a bit of coconut oil (Trader Joe's organic jar is ≈$7 and lasts forever).
Happy schooling!
113 2018-09-10 23:47:04 I’ll pay someone in Ames a case of beer to change the oil in my car tomorrow.
114 2018-09-10 23:46:52 You're welcome. It helped me heal some of my more stubborn piercings. It's a miracle oil, honestly. Good luck!

123 2018-09-10 23:45:57 Extraction will be wrapped up in this b/c it's a carbon-intensive sector. This will basically obligate oil producers to invest heavily in CCS or other carbon reduction measures. They may have a lifeline through massive procurement of offsets, if the yet-to-be-written rules allow.
124 2018-09-10 23:45:32 My dogs mammary tumor is gone, and she’s cancer free after using CBD oil 
125 2018-09-10 23:45:19 Um, shouldn’t the home health aide be the one to confirm the death? Did you ask he or she to check the oil in your car?
126 2018-09-10 23:45:08 Donald Trump:
“My White House is a smooth running machine.”

Your smooth running machine is leaking oil, is in desperate need of a tune-up, has violated environmental emissions codes, and it appears your transmission is about to die.
127 2018-09-10 23:45:07 Maybe foreign oil.
 Their domestic production is on point. 
  And it is dirty AF.
128 2018-09-10 23:44:54 Thank god I get oil changes for the 20 lol
129 2018-09-10 23:44:49 I’ll just use some WD40 penetrating oil tomorrow and hope for the best haha
130 2018-09-10 23:44:48 LITERALLY I did the same thing I was cooking with coconut oil and the oil was solid I was like yaaaaaaaaaassssssssssss
131 2018-09-10 23:44:28 To put up Texas flags, you know, because it's a STATE election. just like Inhoff puts oil coated flags up at his rallies.

133 2018-09-10 23:44:17 Every time Republicans are in power, gas prices increase. It's a given. Most of them are bought by Big Oil, so it makes sense, I suppose. Voting Republican is voting against your best interests unless you're rich and white. 
134 2018-09-10 23:44:08 Judge Union? Didnt know there was one.
Now it makes sense why they make no progress on backlogs.
135 2018-09-10 23:43:49 If you haven't watched it yet #ActiveMeasures is amazing and talks a lot about the oil deal - definitely watch it!
136 2018-09-10 23:43:48 Transfer funds to us now!  All about the money.
137 2018-09-10 23:43:45 yes, I read that bit, and here's where I am going w it. Bond had two companies by then Kao and an oil co. First, I had some doubts if the diamond mine was real. It seemed maybe it was a front, a shell. Second, Craig Bond was on the board from the get-go.
138 2018-09-10 23:43:28 Time for an oil change... oooh, lordy! ＼(＾O＾)／
139 2018-09-10 23:43:22 @realDonaldTrump I have oil
140 2018-09-10 23:43:18 I mist have missed the huge oil production figures in states like Florida and Massachusetts!
141 2018-09-10 23:43:14 The Clean Power Plan is modeled after CO's regulations. CO's front range has a F non-attainment ozone rating, traced back significantly to fracked oil and gas development. Rs & Ds need to end the myth that fracking can expand and be responsibly developed.
142 2018-09-10 23:42:49 The Scottish financial sector was bigger than thier oil sector. 

Where did they all go? Which nationalities now own their bank note issuers?
143 2018-09-10 23:42:45 so  you think  samsonite is better than delsey?
144 2018-09-10 23:42:42 @INCIndia you used oil bonds to purchase oil, like a irresponsible leader. You dont have rights to criticize idiots
145 2018-09-10 23:42:41 Still need to get my oil changed lmao
146 2018-09-10 23:42:25 Nice try at twisting but his oil war was the culprit trumps tax cuts not only make your check bigger every week and has created bonuses and new jobs for many people.

150 2018-09-10 23:41:52 Stop defending the narco regime in Venezuela. The narco regime is in bankruptcy as they made collapse all the private production in the country. Also the oil production is low because they don’t have money to keep the refineries up to date with maintenance. Ignorant

158 2018-09-10 23:41:00 -something else coming as well. The clap of boot on ground in march step brought memories of Nazis in my time in WWII. This even smelled similar...that stench of gun oil, leather, and hatred is something that one could never forget. I could probably dispatch of the lot of them-

175 2018-09-10 23:37:26 #Debt was the instrument by which to expand the money supply, in order to provide economic incentive to dig for oil.

Now let's drop the #ideology goggles and stop arguing the toss about debt.

Debt was fundamental to everything that happened in the last 100+ years.
176 2018-09-10 23:37:24 Firstly people are agitating against government, and govt is not nation.. it's a temporary service provider and we have evry right to ask.. why doesn't d hero PM speak and tell ppl tht he wil not reduce price until oil bonds are repaid!!
177 2018-09-10 23:37:12 Actually Will I don't really give a shit, it's like listening to some senile drooler.  You enjoy your Brexit, Scots will take our dribble of oil and be off - we're not going down with the ship, thanks all the same
178 2018-09-10 23:37:10 Big oil is choking the environment. Healthcare, education, and incarceration have been weaponized to do harm to citizens. Money has taken over politics. Minority families are being traumatized forever.

Meanwhile conservatives vehemently protest #Nike's free speech.

184 2018-09-10 23:36:34 Hence UPA issued oil bonds worth 1.4 lakh crs outstanding as of 2014 to control the fuel prices as crude oil had reached about $140per barrel
Now this wasn’t new.Even NDA1 or Vajpayee also issued Oil bonds btw 1998-2004 which UPA had paid back
All Govt’s make debt which isn’t new

190 2018-09-10 23:35:55 Some of that money pouring includes $250,000 from oil&gas CEO to support pro-fracking @GovRaimondo - we’re fighting for our lives against environmental racism on the frontlines of climate change and need a governor who will stand up for climate justice!
191 2018-09-10 23:35:55 THEY ALWAYS GO UP WHEN THE GRAND OIL PARTY IS IN POWER
192 2018-09-10 23:35:39 I hope something works for you! And apparently the Doterra essential oil for cramps works really well if you haven’t tried that yet
193 2018-09-10 23:35:15 3/4 of the 9/11 hijackers were Saudi nationals.  That didn't seem to stop American's from buying Saudi oil.  Or the US government from selling weapons to the Saudi's.  So, Nike should get a pass on a pair of sneakers.
194 2018-09-10 23:34:43 Patrick Pouyanné, the French CEO of the huge oil company #Total, said, “You cannot operate in 130 countries in the world #without access to US #financial system. Therefore, we are enforcing and complying with US laws and have to leave Iran’s profitable market.”

197 2018-09-10 23:33:56 Venezuela has the worlds largest known oil reserves. This is the aim of the Americans' they've been doing it all of my life. They want the oil. And have now weaponised the Dollar. Turkey, Iran, EU, & Canada have all felt it. The world order is in uncertain territory.
198 2018-09-10 23:33:35 Supposedly, has something to do with an olive oil company. I wonder if it's a sole interest in it for keeping that forehead shiny.
199 2018-09-10 23:33:26 Because when I think of olive oil, I think of Croatia
200 2018-09-10 23:33:20 Closest thing we have to socialism is SS & in Alaska where every man, woman & child gets $1500 per yr  from oil companies & that’s why Palin was elected by getting even more $! All it’s about is sharing a bit of wealth from the corporate Giants  it’s not the boogeyman! Booooo!
201 2018-09-10 23:33:16 That is NOT a comparable argument here. Venezuela only produced oil. ... Oil Price dropped, they had nothing else to sell, so hyperinflation and economic collapse.  
USA opting a socialist medicare system like every other smart nation will be better than now. It's not hard.
202 2018-09-10 23:33:12 Yeah? Like buying 10 $G’s of oil from shit countries? Transport it by boats, trains and trucks?

205 2018-09-10 23:32:29 Any damage whatsoever: Trump’s fault because of climate change “denial”, lack of caring for poor people.
206 2018-09-10 23:32:10 *walks into the oil shop*

213 2018-09-10 23:31:34 @Jim_Jordan Please, go back to the gym, where you are comfortable dominating little boys. Did you want some more oil.
214 2018-09-10 23:31:25 They also have the CBD oil if you prefer that over the gummies.

216 2018-09-10 23:31:23 Just give me the oil and salt. Hold the rocket
217 2018-09-10 23:31:22 The world is moving to hybrid and electric vehicles and sorting trash is second nature. Meanwhile back home we are yet to have a single working refinery, borrowing from China & basing our debt repayment capacity on selling crude oil which may be obsolete soon in another 20 years
218 2018-09-10 23:31:14 When I get back home I’m going to start making chapsticks, candles, essential oil rollers, face moisturizer rollers, dog paw soothing balm, dog essential oil calming sprays and a few other things! Let me know if any of you would like anything specific
219 2018-09-10 23:31:04 Shit that’s 1 oil change if you using full synthetic.
220 2018-09-10 23:30:59 Travel thru TX on I-10 u see them flaring off natural gas from the oil wells. Pisses me off when I know I gotta pay for usage every month while they waste millions of cubic feet of gas like that.
221 2018-09-10 23:30:59 Came down to oil, probably. Oil meant money, so needed to increase the supply?

I've often thought everything economically that happened in the last 100+ years is an abstraction of oil.

So in that sense I see why bitcoin. I just think it's skeuomorphism.
222 2018-09-10 23:30:52 It was the Devil disguised as God & these fools fell for it! Trump snake oil salesmanship talents are what his supporters “love”.
223 2018-09-10 23:30:52 Yeah but who's going to provide the money to stitch you up? If Jeff Klein goes away, all your community funding GOES AWAY! I guess the CON-ARTIST biaggi left that part out! Worry about your FAMILIES! Not some snake oil salesman! JEFF KLEIN DOES! she talks! OH and smiles. SMH

228 2018-09-10 23:30:20 First let me explain what oil bonds are. When Crude Oil prices were at $140+ per barrel, to subsidize and control fuel prices in India, the govt instead of cutting taxes issued Oil Bonds to Oil companies which were to be matured or repayed in 5, 7 or 10 years etc

232 2018-09-10 23:29:41 Arm got splashed with a LOT of hot oil while I was cooking. This recipe better be fucking worth it.
233 2018-09-10 23:29:31 1/2 Once again Sen. Sanders, the diversity man who chose to live in the union's whitest state, has demonstrated his total lack of economic insight by endorsing the tree huggers adoption of ridiculous legislation.  What will your grid be powered by? Hydro, nuclear, coal, or oil?
234 2018-09-10 23:29:10 WD 40. Water displacement 40, cos it was the 40th attempt that got it right but, as it no longer uses fish oil as its base. Shouldn’t it be called WD 41

236 2018-09-10 23:29:08 Big S/O to the @Walmart auto center on 1000 oaks and nacogdoches Road. Service manager trying to discourage me from getting a oil change because they close at 7 and there were 3 cars ahead of me. Then cut me off to help guy behind me because he was there first, I was there 1st
237 2018-09-10 23:29:06 Venezuela is in a economic war right now, because Mister Trump want our oil and minerals.
238 2018-09-10 23:28:54 Now after Modi govt came to power in 2014, the crude oil prices fell to $35 in 2015 and was avg $50 till 2018 and $76 as of date. Also, the Modi govt after coming to power increased Central taxes on petrol and diesel by a whopping 105% on petrol and 331% on Diesel.
239 2018-09-10 23:28:26 For cheaper options, you can use any oil (edible too) or chapstick 
240 2018-09-10 23:28:26 Better oil and gas, frankly. Chemical engineers know how to remove their waste (catalytic converters in cars; scrubbers on power plants).
241 2018-09-10 23:28:15 I just ate bread with Parmesan cheese, olive oil, ground black pepper, and a little bit of balsamic vinegar for dinner.  I am an adult.
242 2018-09-10 23:28:03 Maybe the Whites and the Chinese are just waiting for the time when Nigeria is ready to be sold so they can use our resources - tin, coal, bitumen, gold, gas, oil, farm produce, Lagos dirt, etc to make more money

248 2018-09-10 23:26:16 Gotta get an oil change tomorrow
249 2018-09-10 23:26:11 Fuel price rise is bad. However we cant ignore that BJP had to pay 2 lakh crore unpaid oil bills. Similarly after  Rajiiv Gandhi's rule subsequent  Indian Govt has to pledge our Gold to pay oil bills. We have a history of poor  management of crude oil bill payments.
250 2018-09-10 23:26:10 palm oil is more cleaner and greener than crude oil. thats why we should support biodiesel initiatives based on palmoil.

256 2018-09-10 23:25:29 With only $10,000,000,000,000 of additional debt that is double of all other Presidents debt combined.  And without one banker be locked up during the 2008 bailout crisis and everyone losing their homes to foreclosure. Your hero is my ZERO! Just another Snake oil salesman. Lol!
257 2018-09-10 23:25:27 Give your head a shake man. The women who want to work in the Oil and Gas Industry can do so and do.

269 2018-09-10 23:23:59 You can read the weather you can predict the price of heating oil. I think you asked me that because you think the final club that’s easiest to get into is the one where I’ll have the best chance.
270 2018-09-10 23:23:57 I don’t know? I don’t think so? I’ve been using miscellar water and it’s successfully resisted that, plus showering every day. tonight i even attempted coconut oil which i was told might work to no avail
271 2018-09-10 23:23:56 It's all about the oil people.
272 2018-09-10 23:23:41 @olivianj please look into adding the Bio Mat, alkaline water and an alkaline diet into your life. I’m in a breast cancer survivor group. We do all of these plus the sugar free and cannabis oil and are all doing great.

283 2018-09-10 23:22:02 Yeah and equating big oil companies and the people who work for them as the same is beyond naive. 
Record profits still and haven’t hired back to same levels pre recession.
284 2018-09-10 23:22:01 I need to oil my hair ,it's so dry
285 2018-09-10 23:21:53 attacks our Constitution repeatedly while claiming to be patriotic. No, you don't support America or what it stands for. You have been conned by a snake oil salesman. You believe lies & have misguided loyalty to person who stole an elected office over the foundation of this 3/
286 2018-09-10 23:21:50 get coconut oil!!!!!!!!
287 2018-09-10 23:21:34 If you are going to eat into that sure, ask him how many oil stations are in the vicinity, ask him how much money they gained from entering the place, ask him Why they have more kills on civilians than actual militia
288 2018-09-10 23:21:25 Eucalyptus oil is great for getting things out of carpets if you need to.
289 2018-09-10 23:21:24 I co-own an olive oil company
290 2018-09-10 23:21:13 When you’re a female and you go to get an oil change and end up spending $900. Never knew oil changes were so expensive.

292 2018-09-10 23:21:06 Hi @Ryanair , I'll be flying to France with you soon and I take CBD oil for my fear of flying. Is this allowed on your flights. It will, of course, be below the 100ml level

301 2018-09-10 23:19:31 Looks like a perfectly good breakfast to me. It’s the backward medieval rules and oppressive system. But hey they have oil

304 2018-09-10 23:18:29 High Omega-6 oil (corn oil) consumption has been linked to violence.

308 2018-09-10 23:17:38 Oil will still be needed for at least another 20-50 years. The technology you speak of is locked away in patents. Still has to go threw development phase. Trump team will get to the release of those patents in time.
309 2018-09-10 23:17:36 Like this tweet and I'll draw your avi in 60 seconds using only oil pastels
310 2018-09-10 23:17:34 Have you tried using tea tree oil? I swear by it for healing piercings.
311 2018-09-10 23:17:33 i just sprayed peppermint oil into my ceiling fan to make my room smell good and ended up with it in my eye 

don't be like me
312 2018-09-10 23:17:22 Get call from Production Super of semi large oil co customer. “Live trapped a skunk at the house”

314 2018-09-10 23:17:08 ひどい！
315 2018-09-10 23:17:00 CBD oil really helps. Whole foods has it. No THC so no psychoactive component but helps sleep and stay asleep otherwise it’s  “is 4am daytime or still nighttime? Herbal tea also.
316 2018-09-10 23:16:58 *sprays holy oil on TL*
317 2018-09-10 23:16:41 Grill them brushed with oil, cover grill
318 2018-09-10 23:16:28 Thought Mr.Clemens aka Mark Twain lived during 1800s.. or was he prescient about BJP and its oil pricing policy?
319 2018-09-10 23:16:04 "I'm 27 and already retired if I wanted." Nope. Besides being grammatically incorrect, you are either retired or not.

I also co-own an olive oil company. I pay a nominal amount of money each year to sponsor a tree and in return get a bottle of olive oil.
320 2018-09-10 23:16:02 Check your Engine oil this afternoon.
321 2018-09-10 23:16:02 @tedcruz  reminds me of a sleazy pervert. Even his daughter can’t stand him to touch her. He always looks like he uses snake oil in his hair. No wonder Mulvainey says he is not likely to get elected next to @BetoORourke
#VoteBetoBlue
322 2018-09-10 23:15:52 Not forgetting the thousands upon thousands of innocent iraqis, afghans, Syrians, yemenese murdered off the back of that horrific day. I believe that 9/11 was an inside job to go after Saddam and his oil reserves. Where were the wmd's he allegedly had stockpiled.
323 2018-09-10 23:15:51 Venezuela ranks number 1 in oil reserves. Yet they are starving due to their socialism. BTW Exactly the government DEMS want for America
324 2018-09-10 23:15:47 Fucking douchebr0s 

I can show YOU how to change a tire, check your oil, get out of a headlock, pin your ass to the ground (or verbally de-escalate instead), fix your computer, change a diaper, pick a lock, administer basic first-aid, bleed for one week a month and not die...
325 2018-09-10 23:15:25 Fuck a oil change
326 2018-09-10 23:15:15 Exxon, Mobil, Chevron, Texaco. Now ExxonMobil and Chevron were all direct descendants of the Standard Oil Co. Inc — Established and Majority owned by John D. Rockefeller. Arguably the wealthiest man ever. ~$400B (adjusted for current inflation)

329 2018-09-10 23:14:52 Trus semalem nyobain kleveru nya. Karna ga biasa banget pake oil jadi agak risih karna agak lama gitu menyerapnya. Harus sabar emang.. kalo efeknya blm keliatan tapi yang penting ga bikin bermasalah:')
330 2018-09-10 23:14:35 Oregano oil high as hell
331 2018-09-10 23:14:29 Why does every recipe video always call for "A tablespoon of oil" and then proceed to pour way more than one tablespoon of oil.
332 2018-09-10 23:14:24 Lol. I’ll even choose bread over it. Bread isn’t oily and all that! I hate that oil Ish on donuts. And it also has this weird taste that immediately turns my mood off 
333 2018-09-10 23:14:15 They’re burn pots. Drive at night through the Wyoming oil fields. Looks like jack-o-lanterns. Basically harmless burnoff.
334 2018-09-10 23:14:14 Really tryna figure out what girl stole my castor oil from my bathroom 
335 2018-09-10 23:14:09 Indians who want bigger SUVs, a/cs, malls, expensive designer imported clothes, watches, jewelry n hand-bags r neither bothered nor qualified to comment about oil prices.
336 2018-09-10 23:13:38 No, sweetie, the people who were drawn in by his 'Snake Oil salesman' routine VOTED for him. God DID NOT appoint him. God is more benevolent then that, (S)He would NEVER saddle the American people with this buffoon.
337 2018-09-10 23:13:33 Lol Ya I bet the doxy can help.  Idk what kratom is but i hope it works. I’ve never had CBD oil but I’ve heard good things.

339 2018-09-10 23:13:32 Take this with a grain of salt.
Bob IS a big name in the know but (at least according to this specific report) it’s only speculation.
Relax Oil Country.  It’s gonna be ok.
340 2018-09-10 23:13:24 Dear Nikki your personal bulliyng against Venezuela is getting really boring pal. You are getting the opposite of what you want. NO ONE with brain believe it. It is just too personal. It is NOT objective. It is clear that US is after Venezuela's largest oil reserve in the WORLD.
341 2018-09-10 23:13:18 I dunno why I didnt think to use baby oil for my eczema sooner, this is a game changer
342 2018-09-10 23:12:58 Notice that oil slick trail he left behind?
343 2018-09-10 23:12:50 During his press conference, Brad Keselowski says he wishes they could race Cup twice this week in Indianapolis. 

Midweek at Lucas Oil Raceway and then on Sunday at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
344 2018-09-10 23:12:39 Methane is much too useful to be wasted by “air dumping.” Capturing it would be much better as a tax incentive than some moth-eaten oil depletion allowance. IJS.
345 2018-09-10 23:12:35 PS You are my hero. I have wanted to own an olive oil company since early childhood.
346 2018-09-10 23:12:10 Where is oil subsidiary ? What you did
347 2018-09-10 23:12:02 Gotta give them time to loosen up. Until then use some oil to massage your scalp!
348 2018-09-10 23:12:02 We prospered without the oil sands.  We can again.
349 2018-09-10 23:11:56 Girls can/should be taught to change oil and tires also.  Boys should know how to wash clothes and cook as well!

350 2018-09-10 23:11:39 babe bought me bath and body works, a new guitar pedal, a new fuzzy blanket, paid for my oil change, and even filled my car up with gas. HOW CAN SOMEONE BE SO NICE

353 2018-09-10 23:11:07 CBD oil is great if you have a back problems and I would recommend products from mydailychoice 
354 2018-09-10 23:11:03 i racked comfrey, an arnica topical, ultra strength tiger balm, and an arnica oil lol my foot is gonna be 100x more relaxed than the rest of my body
355 2018-09-10 23:11:00 We need protection against attempts at unreasonable expropriations without compensation like Quebec is doing to all oil and gas permits right now. How do we restrain Governments who do that?
356 2018-09-10 23:10:57 Nothing is comparable to Saudi’s except other Persian gulf oil fields.
357 2018-09-10 23:10:57 Hahahahhahaha Coal is dead , manufacturering is automated and fossil fuel in general is finite. They ain’t coming back. Any marginal gains will be wiped out in a few quarters.   
If you think a 20 year old could have a lifelong career in coal or oil you’re living a fantasy.
358 2018-09-10 23:10:48 Will continue to disappear. I am not convinced that sustainable palm oil is a viable  concept and less convinced it can be absolutely policed. You have to take a lead here and start to reduce the use of this oil. In many products it is superfluous. If I can make bread without it

363 2018-09-10 23:10:11 Break up with him or get some chloroform cook him a nice meal when he least expects it cloth him then tie him Down to his chair get baby oil and a switch call up said girl and see if she’s down to getting him to confess if not continue with your plan and make him sorry enough OR!
364 2018-09-10 23:09:50 Stop so called super powers and Trump friend Putin
USA & Russia are the one supply ammunition and believed in divide and rule policy
Can they run anywhere other than for Oil people fortune to save lives
Why helping Israel killing palastine etc
365 2018-09-10 23:09:36 First Ittold Obama snd Hillary. Just informed them, that's all. But when Trump announced his candidacy, I not only informed him, I told him, he needed it to rule God's ppl. The Annointing Oil From Heaven is also a name for The Event. I made sure he knew. I also officially....

370 2018-09-10 23:08:26 Congrats bro
371 2018-09-10 23:08:19 Norway in particular uses oil revenue to subsidize expenditures.  The left would rather die in the streets than allow us to fully tap into our oil reserves.
372 2018-09-10 23:07:52 Fools crying about price gouging is a given.
373 2018-09-10 23:07:29 So she was in his inner circle & the only way she knows Hillary was robbed was the IC reports?!  Someone's sellin' snake oil to the sick.
374 2018-09-10 23:07:23 Nurse has already publicly stated he is expecting a bridge so not real sure what he'a hoping after here.
375 2018-09-10 23:07:21 "Real old canola oil" as per your employees after serving me burned food that they refused to refund me even tho the food never left the store.
376 2018-09-10 23:07:16 Well, they still produce more oil than we do, despite the difference in land mass.
377 2018-09-10 23:07:11 Hahaha...my brother think deep...if you lucky you may find oil.
378 2018-09-10 23:06:57 @SohiAmarjeet , I would hope the priority might be to get the pipeline off the ground , as opposed to worrying about gender equality in the oil sector on a potentially hypothetical pipeline
379 2018-09-10 23:06:50 Go ahead and START in your own house Nikki. How about going after drug laundry from cartel's(i.e. Colombia & México) to DEA?Or, money laundry from arms dealers to your political's candidates?Or, money laundry from oil business in the countries destroyed by your wars(Irak,Libia).
380 2018-09-10 23:06:35 Heed the warning is good advice that should have been followed years ago, will you try follow them now? Stop big oil & other contributors that see money over life.
381 2018-09-10 23:06:34 Nne eh, it's like they poured a gallon of oil on my face
382 2018-09-10 23:06:33 My car is the being the biggest bitch rn. I get home from work and the check engine light is on. And it turns out I got an oil leak and no gas no money to pay to get it fixed and a job I gotta get to tommorow FML
383 2018-09-10 23:06:28 Ok palm oil. To date an area of Indonesian rainforest approx 4x area of Switzerland has been destroyed. It is now deemed sustainable. Demand rises more forest destroyed. This is out of control. I know we talk about the efficiency of palm oil but...
384 2018-09-10 23:06:13 Unfortunately I’m not from his zone ,Allah ya bashi sa’a
385 2018-09-10 23:05:56 None beyond the existing ones with oil.
386 2018-09-10 23:05:48 I dont care about no one but me
387 2018-09-10 23:05:45 I honestly don't even think oil will run out, there's a reason they call it the blood of the earth
388 2018-09-10 23:05:40 Keep supporting a man who sold us out to big sugar so he could finance his senate campaign and his ultimate goal of Pres. Ask about his money parked in the caymans, his cronies and profits from health care deals and his marriage to oil indistry. Bought an dpaid for by business
389 2018-09-10 23:05:23 So my mom has never used cbd oil for cramps but she has used it as a topical treatment on her severely messed up feet (bones out of place, expanded ligaments, alll sorts of bad things) and has had some real success with it. Hasn’t affected her like smoking weed does.
390 2018-09-10 23:05:20 travel size Jamaican caster oil - we don't ask for much
391 2018-09-10 23:05:17 Simple, simple Rach, Steamed Riced Cauliflower, Ground Turkey , Turkey sausage , onion and celery and season it up . I put a lil bit of olive oil in it too

393 2018-09-10 23:04:59 Outside the playoffs, will fondly remember Chiasson’s 2 goal performance in Boston just before Christmas that included a nice shorty. Good luck in Oil Country.
394 2018-09-10 23:04:54 It may be - Nurse probably wants term and Oil want bridge. It'd be nice to see Chia win a contract neg. Tight cap issues
395 2018-09-10 23:04:52 Wait for the dealership to charge you 2&20 for the oil change
396 2018-09-10 23:04:52 And now we know she smells good too. Like Moroccan oil!
397 2018-09-10 23:04:48 Yeah because people who work in oil and gas have had it real easy over the past few years.
398 2018-09-10 23:04:47 Skylar somehow dumped a bottle of baby oil all over my bathroom floor so that’s how my days going
399 2018-09-10 23:04:30 I dont know if someone said this already, but olive oil can be really good as a replacement for shaving cream. Also investing in a really nice razor, and exfoliating before you shave (either with loufa or sugar scrub)
400 2018-09-10 23:04:24 I knew it when I hit the button
401 2018-09-10 23:04:20 So let me guess, USA wants to go in and rescue brown people?? USA wants the oil period! 
402 2018-09-10 23:04:16 so gas companies can monopolize alternative energy once we deplete the oil
403 2018-09-10 23:04:14 They hung him for a reason, and it wasn’t because we wanted their oil...
404 2018-09-10 23:03:59 Scheduling one on one essential oil classes! Let me know if you want to set a time 
405 2018-09-10 23:03:38 He won't win because he will either be in prison or a straight jacket OR! Putin will pack him in an old oil barrel.
406 2018-09-10 23:03:34 @longjohnslvrs as per your employees, "its my problem to deal with the food but i will not be refunded". So your company can serve me burned food cooked with old oil and i can not return it?
407 2018-09-10 23:03:34 We love you anyways "Oil Tot".....hugs!
408 2018-09-10 23:03:33 Being a girl must be weird bc y’all could take hours to get ready but y’all can’t take 5 mins to check the oil on a car
409 2018-09-10 23:03:29 i maintain there is such thing as a thicc salad. im talking imported olive oil, french feta (dont fight me on that), home grown tomatoes
410 2018-09-10 23:03:28 @jennmartin80 have you tried making dessert hummus? Basically chickpeas plus Olive oil (I might try peanut oil next time), vanilla, pb, sugar (or honey, Maple syrup, whatever) and once blended sir in some chocolate chips. Use Apple pears coconut and Graham for dipping
411 2018-09-10 23:03:27 Florence Russia Collusion.
412 2018-09-10 23:03:24 Horse sheet. @Twitter needs to outlaw these snake oil purveyors.
413 2018-09-10 23:03:17 Ah I wish I could help but I’m not sure about dewy things because my skin is quite the oil slick LOL I know thataylaa on YouTube is like super duper pale and she has reviewed almost every foundation known to man so that might be helpful!
414 2018-09-10 23:03:04 Lendman: "Erdogan - He’s against Syria’s liberating struggle, aiming to   annex the country’s  territory bordering Turkey, including its oil   fields, a prize he’s long  coveted, including in northern Iraq."
415 2018-09-10 23:02:58 You’re right it’s communism. That’s what Russia did to the oil industry’s car industries steel industries. The means of production were taken over by the state. They produced one car and poor quality goods because of lack of competition.
416 2018-09-10 23:02:51 Example of hit to #gasoline #demand from #storm like #HurricaneFlorence is in recent #EIA report showing demand +571,000 bpd in 2018 vs '17 as hurricanes curbed demand? #Harvey affected #refinery output also. Florence will pass over fuel products pipelines & terminals. #OOTT #oil

421 2018-09-10 23:02:30 Right after I said I'll be good please unblock me for christmas jesus himself took my surface pen and put it in the oil spill I just can't find it
422 2018-09-10 23:02:01 What a terrible decision for national economy of Canada.  Canada can’t just operate on taxes and importing oil which is also shipped in and doesn’t have to meet the same regulations.  Wake up Canada.

425 2018-09-10 23:01:54 Word to describe you for today is “Mountebank”. It comes from the Italian phrase “to mount a bench” as the snake oil salesmen of the past did to gather a crowd and sell them useless potions. In a sentence “We didn’t know Lankford was a mountebank until he was elected”
426 2018-09-10 23:01:53 I have found the answer to any pains you may be suffering from.  CBD oil works !! And, @elixinol is at the top of the charts when it comes to CBD oil products.  Believe me (and @erniemartinezSD) you will love the end results !!

429 2018-09-10 23:01:34 @longjohnslvrs thanks for attempting to steal my money! Your company is terrible and i will fight you to the end.  No refund policy on food that was burned due to "bad oil" as stated by your store manager.  The food never left the store.

434 2018-09-10 23:01:05 They want to keep a military presence in the area for oil interests, for example. It's all about keeping a Western presence. It's why Europe supports Israel as well.

567 2018-09-10 22:45:50 I would literally rather have an infected bottle of oil as president than @realDonaldTrump

570 2018-09-10 22:45:28 Now we're energy independent, oil/energy can't rise to 40% or more and send us into another resession. That is what cause the 72, 76 and 2008 rescission.
571 2018-09-10 22:45:27 Incorporating tea tree oil in my skin routine. Excited to see some results
572 2018-09-10 22:45:26 "Epidiolex is GW’s lead cannabinoid product candidate and is a proprietary oral solution of pure plant-derived cannabidiol, or CBD."
By oral solution they mean alcohol extracted ("Rick Simpson" oil)
Epidiolex is FDA approved in other words.... Say it with me... Medical marijuana
573 2018-09-10 22:45:09 We're still holding out. We're also not buying more oil til after payday! 
574 2018-09-10 22:44:56 Why do you think the foolish virgins don’t have enough oil to last all night?
575 2018-09-10 22:44:46 To be fair, this is likely a two-way street issue
576 2018-09-10 22:44:41 Can u guys give me a lift to the new #blueplanet that's coming into view?

577 2018-09-10 22:44:35 Last year I was spending my money on dumb things. This year I’m paying for a car payment, gas, oil change, a window tint ticket, and so many other things. Take me back to no responsibilities
578 2018-09-10 22:44:33 Y'all remember when we had that oil spill? I hope the ducks from that Dawn commercial are ok.

581 2018-09-10 22:43:45 Hey @chevrolet 

One of your dealers came to my college age son with a bill for a diesel Cruze oil change at $150

Since he was raised well he wanted an itemized bill of that

They then charged $62.50

That is sad
582 2018-09-10 22:43:33 How niggas name “JDM” on Facebook, but they don’t even know how to do an oil change
583 2018-09-10 22:43:25 People should look into his connections with Indonesia oil companies.
584 2018-09-10 22:43:19 So I use lavender diffusers in my room and it helps lessen the chances of my migraines but along with that rosemary, peppermint, chamomile, Eucalyptus oil all help with headaches!

589 2018-09-10 22:43:02 Prue, look in the mirror. You’re no oil painting. It seems your only contribution to public discourse is piss and vinegar.
590 2018-09-10 22:42:37 Hey Colorado voters! "Protect Colorado" is a nameless, faceless SuperPAC monster.  It features out -of- state and out-of-country oil and gas $$$. Read the Colorado proposition thoroughly. Analyze the multiple ballot guidebooks and pro/con articles to allow you to vote smart!

T was a typo

600 2018-09-10 22:41:16 You tie oil pipelines and forest fires together but you fail to address the fact that BC exports record amounts of the worst fossil fuel that being coal but I guess you have 5 billion reasons why you dont want this stopped. Hypocrite 
601 2018-09-10 22:41:01 I have this food grade lavender oil I got at Pikes in Seattle but it shouldn't be too hard to find at health food stores! Just a drop or two is moooore than enough for some solid lavender flavor.
602 2018-09-10 22:40:36 I dont care if the game is at the back drop of an oil field. OSU is gonna put the hole nation on notice.

606 2018-09-10 22:39:47 I’m 40 and they make me feel like I look 25! Hate and selling your soul for a WH gig really isn’t something Oil of Olay twice a day can fix.
607 2018-09-10 22:39:39 This is a cassada leaf with coconut oil appreciation tweet. 
608 2018-09-10 22:39:33 God bless lagosians, wake up as early as 5:30 and not still home by now I wish my house could accommodate all these people on the road by this time
609 2018-09-10 22:39:18 Very little of California #oil is used for power. The headline is deceiving as it should have specified electricity.

612 2018-09-10 22:39:10 Actually before 2011, Assad refused an aggressive proposal for an Oil Pipeline passing through the country. Hence, why most "rebels" are not actually Syrian.

616 2018-09-10 22:38:31 Adult disappointment: getting stuck in traffic and not making it home in time to get your oil changed.
617 2018-09-10 22:38:28 @realDonaldTrump For us, it's only important to fully implement the oil and bank sanctions, we will never tolerate the exemption. Be careful that when you break your relationship, your situation becomes dangerous. People are aware and they understand everything.

620 2018-09-10 22:37:58 Someone spoil me, I need an oil change and new car tags.

623 2018-09-10 22:37:34 Nope! It's a roasted garlic oil base with crushed, roasted garlic on the crust, feta cheese, spinach and mozzarella!
624 2018-09-10 22:37:28 <The UKGov was terrified Scotland would become independent after oil was discovered so the UKGov have kept the Shetlanders sweet and onside, the usual British tactic of divide and conquer, fortunately, most Shetlanders are beginning to realize.
625 2018-09-10 22:37:26 Prices on oil and basic commodities gone high and your concern is how to stay in power?? Filipinos should really think through who they're voting for in the next election.
626 2018-09-10 22:37:24 Happy Islamic New Year to Us, 1440AH, May Allah make us begin this year with the best templates.

638 2018-09-10 22:36:21 my car is like two hundred miles past an oil change and now we have to evac whoops
639 2018-09-10 22:36:17 So i poured olive oil into a glass and was seconds away from diluting it and drinking it bc i thought it was orange squash. Hows your day going twitter?

645 2018-09-10 22:36:03 Ya I’m with you guys on this one. I’m indifferent with Garrison and Chiasson. Upshall I feel is still a useful player that fits a need for Oilers.
646 2018-09-10 22:35:59 An egg company outperforms oil companies. Woe to the petro-states.

650 2018-09-10 22:35:42 Hey @Honda - my #Clarity #PHEV would be just about perfect if the algorithm for oil changes were "aware" that I almost never use the gas engine (2500 miles so far, haven't purchased gas yet); does it make sense for me to change the oil more often than I buy gas? #cmonHonda!
651 2018-09-10 22:35:40 You’re rich that’s oil
652 2018-09-10 22:35:36 Dims blocked oil spill eating bacteria at hte BP oil spill. Actually, Obama blocked ALL response until oil hit the shores and states took over with cleanup costs X 3.
Dims wanted it to be bad.
653 2018-09-10 22:35:33 Less regulation, less regulation, less regulation, that is all the Emperor knows.  The first big oil leak along Keystone and he will blame Chuck Schumer!

655 2018-09-10 22:35:17 The trouble is a number of years ago Shetland was able to strike a deal with the UKGov which allowed them a minuscule oil fund so certain Shetlanders are under the delusion that the UKGov is their friend, they've no idea they were played like an old fiddle.>
656 2018-09-10 22:35:15 I almost said it’s also always been that way in war, the victor takes the spoils and all is fair in love and war? 
We don’t need the oil. Having airplanes flown into major buildings and the pentagon killing 1000s is a good enough reason to go to war for me.
657 2018-09-10 22:35:12 
658 2018-09-10 22:35:12 I sprayed 3 quarters of a bottle of hair oil into my 80cm wig (remember badou ?) so it wasn't a complete nightmare... so I guess I just gotta spray a whole bottle or 2 for this 100cm disaster

670 2018-09-10 22:33:36 NOTE TO SELF. Don't drink chili oil, ever again.
671 2018-09-10 22:33:36 What's your evidence for that, other than your own high regard for your opinion? Canada's ready to fly apart cuz unelected, accountable courts have put a handful of natives, enviro-kooks & their foreign backers in charge of our oil. If Trudeau had any balls he'd invoke S. 33 too.
672 2018-09-10 22:33:33 My Mother is an independent and intelligent person. 
Having said that, this morning she proudly told me that moisturiser is a scam because all you really need is SPF. 
But when I said “yeah, it’s a bit like snake oil”, she asked me how much snake oil was and if it worked.
673 2018-09-10 22:33:27 lemon juice/honey/coconut oil/tea tree oil. Or try going to Whole Foods & get derma-e scar gel, it’s kind of expensive for what you’re getting though
674 2018-09-10 22:33:20 Nice pick. Previous ceo canned after investing in a private oil and gas fund. Bizarre. But is the board ok? I called the company and emailed them and no response   seems like a private public
675 2018-09-10 22:33:11 Nah, he needs to figure out way to get those random big oil baron donors and find a way to trick them into contribute those HUGE bits/subs every single month.
676 2018-09-10 22:32:55 Used avocado oil when the explicitly given directions were for coconut oils
677 2018-09-10 22:32:45 Yeah? That ermine-gland oil in this office supply outlet mall I couldn't come in.
678 2018-09-10 22:32:42 I have complete faith in you, Toyota’s are so easy to maintain! Just YouTube how to do it and you’ll be fine! I’ve been changing my own oil for yeeeaarrsss, I promise it’s not hard at all
679 2018-09-10 22:32:34 went to the store twice just to come home and realize I have no oil to cook anything 
680 2018-09-10 22:32:31 The oil pen was clutch for this past weekend but I’m still riding with regular tree as my main form of getting my mind right
681 2018-09-10 22:32:18 im done with this hurricane and storm comin in, I will round up all my friends and and drag them to CA with me lets go.
682 2018-09-10 22:32:18 who was that old guy going progressively more insane who always tweeted about banging models and drinking olive oil
683 2018-09-10 22:31:59 He owns an olive oil company... maybe he is wealthy the Corleone style  (regardless of the topic, Godfather references are always fun )

686 2018-09-10 22:31:43 We are more than aware that you can do two things at once and be a racist nazi. And for the record, as your education seems to have some holes in it, Nazis are fascists. Communists are socialists. Do you mix up oil and water too?
687 2018-09-10 22:31:15 Productive summer regarding hair growth. Finally past my shoulders in my mid back area. No heat, only touch it when I wash or oil it. Love the results.
688 2018-09-10 22:31:11 The net difference taxes paid by Albertans and business to the federal gov't versus what AB gov got back in transfer payments is $220 billion from 2007-2015. Norway's fund includes revenue from ownership in oilco's/development. They have access to global markets for their oil.

693 2018-09-10 22:31:00 Ask @DrOz why he endorses pseudoscientific/snake oil cures
694 2018-09-10 22:30:53 I don’t have the benefit of the report, but a strong hunch tells me the chart would look a lot different on a price per barrel of oil basis — especially as GOR mix accelerates and tier 2 acreage comes online.
695 2018-09-10 22:30:46 “That’s how we roll”.- Obama ...slick political organizer whose minions and acolytes may, still to this day, continue to fool themselves, or allow and desire everyone else to follow and be fooled by the snake oil vendor / democrat party machine. “Sad” indeed.

699 2018-09-10 22:30:21 it was 20 minutes, oil on canvas. I needed to use up the paint on the palette.. I didn't want it to dry. I was in top form, looking forward to a night out. I captured something in the moment
700 2018-09-10 22:30:20 I think you may be beginning to make sense, after seeming like such a dunce for all these months. You mean that Venezuela is a wake-up call because it highlights the corruption of the US, right? Obama calling it an "extraordinary national security threat" because of their oil?
701 2018-09-10 22:29:57 So happy to see my favorite essential oil company @RMessentialoils has partnered with @OURrescue and @TimBBallard who do incredible rescues without getting nearly enough recognition for it 
702 2018-09-10 22:29:56 2/ Instead of funding terror, Wahhabism, and inciting against Israel, you have a moral obligation to absorb these "leftover" Arabs. Israel does not have an oil economy, but you do. You should be taking responsibility for them.
703 2018-09-10 22:29:54 I’ve had it! You are so stupid I can’t stand it. A con man selling snake oil to a sad group who want something better but will never find it with you.

707 2018-09-10 22:29:22 Most of the electricity in my town comes from the dam on the river. But not everything is electric. Some things will still need oil.
708 2018-09-10 22:29:00 Trump is a robot, with a thick layer of human fat to hide the gears and circuits. Sometimes the robot doesn't get enough oil. You've seen that, Mr. Algorithm.

While it works, it doesnt appeal to me. I am thinking of switching the oil out and adding Magma. IDK :/

You're ok with all if that but not ok with taking care of our own citizens.
736 2018-09-10 22:25:49 Which would explain why they're pushing electric cars so hard.  

They have power, they don't have the oil without a fracking book, especially if Alaska redirects to Asia.  

That explains a lot, really.

844 2018-09-10 22:12:32 CBD is not weed, it is hemp oil and is legal everywhere since it does not contain THC. And all vegans drinking vegan protein it cones from the same stuff: HEMP!

 Shaaaaaawn  Rosehip oil for healing! I know what I'm saying

846 2018-09-10 22:12:15 Psalm of  "King David".
Still Psalm 23

"Though' has anointed my head with oil. My cup runner over. Surely your goodness and lovingkindess shall follow me all the days of my life; and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord, forevermore".
847 2018-09-10 22:12:12 "Big body caddy lane switchers sippin oil smelling like a paint thinner. 12 tryna bet a case wit ya niggas telling they ain’t gotta chase niggas" @JoeyPurps
848 2018-09-10 22:12:11 Or better yet, stop burning so much coal and oil, unless you want the problem to keep getting worse.
849 2018-09-10 22:12:04 Don't be stupid. Trump would start a Syrian like war with you immediately if he could lay his small hands on your oil.
850 2018-09-10 22:12:03 I was looking for this Back then they'll rub oil on one guy's head and it becomes super shiny
851 2018-09-10 22:11:55 Alivia is over here acting like an elite member of the royal family because I put cuticle oil on after I painted her nails  only touching shit with her finger tips like that Peter griffin meme 
852 2018-09-10 22:11:54 I know the standard call is suggest Cruz has been bought, one problem with that..he’s never voted against his promise in favor of big pharma, globalism, oil or any other “bigs” he’s being accused of. Ted’s consistent
Lower taxes 
More jobs 
Strong borders 
Strong 2A 
Strong Texas
853 2018-09-10 22:11:24 This administration and truth are like oil and water.
854 2018-09-10 22:11:12 My dad used to make a sliced potato dish, but with olive oil, fried onions, artichokes and herbs for which I don't really know the name, was delish though.
855 2018-09-10 22:11:04 They listen to snake oil salesmen.
856 2018-09-10 22:11:01 @followlasg @AkinwunmiAmbode The lack of progress In construction of Brt lane from Ikeja to iyana ipaja axis is causing untold hardship to lagosians,for God's sake how will people still be on the road by this time,pls pay the contractor and speed up this work.
857 2018-09-10 22:10:47 O just three
I was talking about the whale people 

858 2018-09-10 22:10:45 One question for Rump cultists - what good are oil and gas jobs if your children are poisoned by methane and your home is destroyed by climate change?
859 2018-09-10 22:10:43 Have I said I hate @AmericanAir a319 & a321 configs. Yeah I got lucky in main extra. Olive oil anybody? Sardines have more space than these coach seats...
860 2018-09-10 22:10:40 Classic you @PaulTob68706751  right here! “ It was like Dallas or Dynasty, without the oil and the money !”  #FairPlayToYou #TheJohnPauls

862 2018-09-10 22:10:31 Y'all be burning midnight oil in the studio
863 2018-09-10 22:10:27 Hey I’m all for it. There are some areas though in the US which wouldn’t produce enough energy to supply the cities, so we would still be reliant on some oil.
864 2018-09-10 22:10:22 Cbd oil sorts it loads look at my pinned tweet
865 2018-09-10 22:10:21 あ、猫…！と、遠回りしようぜ？
866 2018-09-10 22:10:19 No it's not, the oil price is picking up pace and the US $ is kicking some Rand ass. We might be looking at R18.5 to the litre by next year and R16 to a single dollar, we are fucked
867 2018-09-10 22:10:05 ああ、これはまずい。実にまずい。0.1トン超えたよ。
868 2018-09-10 22:09:57 Masha Allah. I'm in search of an Islamiyya for my brother in Lag. I want to know if it's an area close to ours so he can join too.
869 2018-09-10 22:09:46 Open both eyes
870 2018-09-10 22:09:25 med)) the side effects for my meds were so bad that staying on them would have legitimately been a health risk and not allowed me to function
So I just stopped them. :/ Gonna try CBD oil in a few days tho.
This week is gonna be a shitshow.
871 2018-09-10 22:09:01 I think so.
She could crushed them all.
872 2018-09-10 22:08:00 Dr. Oz is bad and you should feel bad

The only defensible reason to platform a snake oil salesman is if you're going to spend the whole time mercilessly destroying his claims
873 2018-09-10 22:07:59 I love coconut oil 
874 2018-09-10 22:07:53 But I bet he won’t do it from within Mattis’ reach
875 2018-09-10 22:07:51 Oil platforms
876 2018-09-10 22:07:51 Read the article first ma’am, market is trading at 11% slope while contract was signed at 13%. Meaning we’re paying more today even though the oil prices were lower in 2015 than today.
877 2018-09-10 22:07:46 Fn
878 2018-09-10 22:07:44 Oil spots can be removed from clothing with Talcum Powder.
879 2018-09-10 22:07:22 Give us a 3 day working week John.

When the power stations go on strike through not having been paid for 6 months & running out of Venezuelan oil, we’ll have no choice.

881 2018-09-10 22:06:49 Hasks is a new one! From OGX I use the coconut miracle oil conditioner and hair oil and their pomegranate scalp detox for shampoo. Those are the only things I use
882 2018-09-10 22:06:45 Cool
883 2018-09-10 22:06:27 She’s fning with me
884 2018-09-10 22:06:22 Had that same conversation today. You don't check another man's oil.
885 2018-09-10 22:06:21 #kwch12 As to the story about Westar and the polls... Now, how much more are they going to raise our bill.
I swear, some one needs to put a freeze check on them .
Just another way to dig deeper in your pocket.
Oil prices drop, they raise rates.
Oil prices go up, they raise rates.
886 2018-09-10 22:06:12 Tire fixed , oil changed , and got new mats. PLUS I took a nap  Preeeeeetty productive day.
887 2018-09-10 22:06:01 Hey, Brooke! Sounds like the chicken didn't have a chance to fully crisp up before you went in for a flip. Otherwise, our best tips are to start with a fully pre-heated pan and not being shy with the oil.
888 2018-09-10 22:06:00 Omg. The oil companies are going to get blackwater and invade Cali.
889 2018-09-10 22:05:53 Exactly fam
890 2018-09-10 22:05:47 every now and again I remember that one season of worst cooks in america where in the auditions a woman put baby oil in her lasagna bc it “softens the esophagus”

that bit has stuck with me for years at this point bc it’s just like?? bINCH YOU WHAT????
891 2018-09-10 22:05:13 Before leaving office, Gov. Rick “Skelator” Scott is expected to announce renaming Florida manatees, “trumps,” in the hopes that it will grace him flavors with pRecedent Trump...he said it’s befitting, since the manatee/trumps hold up well to “red tide, and oil slicks!”
892 2018-09-10 22:04:50 #Searching for CBD oil for your dog is a nightmare seriously!
893 2018-09-10 22:04:50 Exporters of oil realize $100 pb is bad for everyone an everything.
894 2018-09-10 22:04:35 So what you’re saying is, if she’s not connected to oil... but that’s where she lives... then... is she maybe involved with... and just hear me out here... the other industry on the sign maybe?
895 2018-09-10 22:04:33 Hence UPA issued oil bonds worth 1.4 lakh crs outstanding as of2014 to control the fuel prices as crude oil had reached about $140per barrel
Now this wasn’t new.Even NDA1 or Vajpayee also issued Oil bonds btw 1998-2004 which UPA had paid back
All Govt’s make debt which isn’t new
896 2018-09-10 22:04:30 The best are homemade sliced up and deep  fried in olive oil..IMO
897 2018-09-10 22:04:22 Nice attempt at deflection, do you seriously imagine that if these greedy Tory bastards even got a sniff that there might be oil in England that they wouldn't already be down on their hands & knees trying to dig it out themselves? 
898 2018-09-10 22:04:16 general public: hey man why do u hate women so much
motherfucker named kyle: anyway.. i co-own an olive oil company
899 2018-09-10 22:03:42 So my car has a small laundry list of things that need to be fixed on a sooner than later (but not immediate) timeline. These include:

- brakes (all four pads and rotors)
- small leak in the fuel intake system
- small oil leak
- flush of major fluids
- brake light that stays on
900 2018-09-10 22:03:35 I only use shampoo once a week and conditioner the rest of the time. I also put an oil after towel drying my hair daily and my hair loves it but I don't haha

If not when I go for my free oil change I'll ask them
904 2018-09-10 22:02:24 2. What are the odds that my buying a mini fridge and no longer storing food where my housemates can fuck with it, and cooking oil being dumped on my fucking bike pedal by a disgruntled fatfuck, are unrelated?
905 2018-09-10 22:02:24 My baby can finally get up again. This oil change was wayyyyyyy overdue
906 2018-09-10 22:02:21 This is a shocking eye opener for a non Bhakth BJP supporter like me. Can BJP hide behind the veil of Oil Bonds issued by MMS to justify this hike?
907 2018-09-10 22:02:11 It was a few weeks ago when local #Somalis in and around #Jeexdin set the oilfield a blaze. Yesterday, #Somalis once again rejected #Ethiopia’s attempt to exploit #Somali natural resources— #Jeexdin is burning. Taps have been turned off and flow of oil stopped #Somalia #JigJiga

 -Huge tax increases imposed by Obama and the Democrats in Congress since 2008.
912 2018-09-10 22:01:14 If ppl applied the “I don’t tip anymore because of prices, you should just end tipping because everything is so expensive!” mentality to purchasing of Gas.
I wonder what society would look like.

picking fights with the livelihood of small business and workers but not big oil?
913 2018-09-10 22:00:59 Stop. Do not respond. You are a complete righty. Far, Farr right. So right, you are completely Wrong. I see you buying every ounce of,          " snake oil" he delivers up, piled up on a shit sandwich.
914 2018-09-10 22:00:56 Stay high. Duh. I’m smoking it, making oil and using that for edibles and to add to my lotion. The money I’d save would go straight into my mortgage savings.
915 2018-09-10 22:00:47 Jst heard you're going after Energy Cos to address methane leaks from oil/gas wells...U smoking with Elan?...That's climate change Mr.D...One great step to mankind !  "Next conquer solar & wind eliminating fossil fuels..."

917 2018-09-10 22:00:39 Tesla is noted for its electric cars but the most significant development may be in energy storage.  This will impact electric energy producers, oil producers and coal producers. Storing renewable energy has been the missing link.

927 2018-09-10 22:00:03 So due to hike in taxes on Fuel prices, Modi Govt collected about 10 Lakh crores in taxes in which as per Oil Minister Pradhan, the govt has already paid the dues related to Oil Bonds. Even after paying for the dues of 2 Lakh crores, govt made about 8 Lakh crores in taxes which

930 2018-09-10 21:59:26 Remember the oil is coming from Canada. Right now we have an issue with NAFTA so the pipeline may never carry anything.
931 2018-09-10 21:59:11 Literally so annoyed i have been here since 11:30 waiting for an oil change & tire rotation in the “express lane “ here at Victorville motors and I have another hour to wait  . Smh .
932 2018-09-10 21:59:08 you fought for a rich mans cheap labor power and oil.

935 2018-09-10 21:58:28 If it works let me know i just told @kv198champion  his bourbon taste like motor oil.
936 2018-09-10 21:58:23 You are a snake oil salesman, a white collar criminal fooling the feeble minded while you and your swamp monsters enrich your pockets at the expense of the people. You keep obstructing Mueller's investigation because you are guilty of $ laundering and treason. Resign or be fired!
937 2018-09-10 21:58:14 If you have a nearby  Trader Joes, they have a really good vegan pesto. Otherwise, minced garlic in sauteed olive oil always works for me!
938 2018-09-10 21:57:59 TV journalist Mr. @sudhirchaudhary mentioned today that the bandh which was called today was meaningless, and showed a percentage figure how the sheer increase in price is indeed less than that of UPA times, but he forgot to take crude oil price in consideration.
939 2018-09-10 21:57:47 Bio oil
940 2018-09-10 21:57:23 Retrofit estimates are 5-10 yrs. The oil in Alberta is an anomaly & will need special refining
941 2018-09-10 21:57:20 Just wanna slap some coconut oil on your ass and watch you shake it

Scar know you ?
944 2018-09-10 21:57:09 Even this graph is wrong,
Cost of crude oil =international market price + election expenses +grants to industrialists + modi ji's day to day expenses +godhi media expenses and other miscellaneous expenses 

945 2018-09-10 21:57:08 tea tree oil works !wonders!
946 2018-09-10 21:56:59 Somehow managed to barely make it to the post office despite the oil change bullshit. Didn't make it to the movies though. Fk it at this point.

948 2018-09-10 21:56:21 So much about Venezuela's situation, reeks of big oil manipulations.
If you ever talk about the starvation and riots there, you should at least start with how the crisis actually began and which wealth class is making the biggest stink about it.
949 2018-09-10 21:55:56 Thinking about driving down this weekend to Texas. Anyone know of any jobs going on? Pipeline or whatever in the oil field
950 2018-09-10 21:55:52 Easy everybody... Leo’s yacht runs on whale oil from dead carcasses (natural causes)
that I find all over the world and deliver to him.
951 2018-09-10 21:55:45 Liverpool is a top example of how a club without oil money should be run!
952 2018-09-10 21:55:42 I’m so proud of myself! I just put oil in my car without the help of @kaileielizondo !!! Girl!! Thank you for teaching me
953 2018-09-10 21:55:38 It is also true that lower taxes lead to a lower cost of breakeven for oil producers (after-tax rate of return...)
My sense is there is partial credit for energy capex uplift to tax reform and also partial credit to favorable regulatory environment, along with some cyclicality
954 2018-09-10 21:55:28 blare is an oil shill, promoting climate change denial and other crack-pottery. wouldn't surprise me in the least if he's also the one behind "friends of science"

956 2018-09-10 21:55:13 I love oil paintings

                  Sles free
                     Paraffin wax free
shampoo called Folténe and my life will never be the same again.
958 2018-09-10 21:55:08 Nigeria is the poorest country in the world. Which oil are they using well? They have more citizens in the diaspora than any country? Nigeria has 120 million people living in extreme poverty. 
959 2018-09-10 21:55:07 The US needs to stop the sanctions for regime change for OIL. Problem would solve itself.
960 2018-09-10 21:54:12 90+% of self-proclaimed “social media influencers” are peddling snake oil in the form of useless ebooks, paid followers, and basic google-able strategies because they lack any demonstrable expertise or insights
961 2018-09-10 21:54:06 He is not into oil business

Definitely he makes those cash from his 8years government plus Babatunde Fashola 8years govt conjunction wit Ambode 3 and half years govt and still counting
962 2018-09-10 21:54:06 Fold in five ounces of olive oil then allow to simmer.
963 2018-09-10 21:54:03 LOL... "Maybe".. "Could".. "Perhaps",.. "Might Be",,, Could you not find a story that was bit more vague?.. 2015 and STILL no oil... Smell something?... Aye!! me too... 
964 2018-09-10 21:53:54 How disgusting of YOU. It is not a "gift" it is Regime change for OIL as usual. Who has the most oil on the planet? Venezuela. Get your facts straight.
965 2018-09-10 21:53:34 What no truffle oil? What is the world coming to?
966 2018-09-10 21:53:18 Finally treating my car and getting an oil change
967 2018-09-10 21:53:16 To all y'all that will be affected by the hurricane, please stay safe.
Don't wait until the last minute for preparations.
If people are out of flashlights, ask about oil lamps, people forget about those.
Just. Whatever you can, please be safe.
968 2018-09-10 21:53:14 It is, and I understand Russia is highly dubious. But seeing as the US and Russia are the world's largest producers of oil and gas, this makes sense. Saudi Arabia's energy minister will also be there. Senators going for no reason is weird. This is not.

977 2018-09-10 21:52:26 WHY is it OK for ALL Muslim countries to violently protect their Culture & Religion. This violence is endorsed & encouraged by Canada,USA etc through Oil purchases & selling Weapons!
Why are Germany, Sweden & Europe being Media shamed for Democratically preserving their culture?
978 2018-09-10 21:52:14 They're the worst. I'd push them into vats of boiling oil if only I could find some.
979 2018-09-10 21:52:09 Get well soon big hugs.

Oil is no joke
980 2018-09-10 21:51:52 nah ... he'll be in grifter heaven when he loses, he'll become a lobbyist for the oil cartels.
981 2018-09-10 21:51:35 It's also insanely good in strong black coffee. In Vancouver, in '99 anyway, it was just there on the counter in cafés, Inc Starbucks. Like seeing truffle oil in a big plastic truffle on a wimpy table.
982 2018-09-10 21:51:27 but we should - that's pretty much the whole point here.
We also should be taxing the oil companies correctly - instead, Westminster is GIVING them tax money.

984 2018-09-10 21:51:18 1.What I am really concerned about is not gold mining reserves depleting which they obviously are (in the law abiding countries anyway) but rather oil depletion. Oil is still captive to the $IMS and the lack of gold for the Saudis gave birth to the shale push once that ends -bad.
985 2018-09-10 21:51:14 I hate when that happens!

988 2018-09-10 21:50:43 Yes the area we control in syria is the old conocophillips oil fields. I was referring to a name on map i know the history of conocophillips.
989 2018-09-10 21:50:42 I bought a Honda.

I owned 2 Toyotas. A 2003 Celica and a 2009 Matrix. Had problems with both cars. Celica had a loud squeak in the engine Toyota couldn’t solve. Car sounded like a junker.

Matrix had a oil consumption problem. Toyota denied the flaw. I had to pay $4K to repair.
990 2018-09-10 21:50:35 Bankrupt and pumping out dirty oil right next to homes but there going green.  LOL
991 2018-09-10 21:50:32 Oil was applied for picture purpose
992 2018-09-10 21:50:27 Waters has called Trump "a bully, an egotistical maniac, a liar & someone who did not need to be President" "the most deplorable person I've ever met in my life". In Waters said Trump's advisors who have ties to Russia or have oil and gas interests there are "a bunch of scumbags"
993 2018-09-10 21:50:13 Oil adding bodies on the right side... prepping for a move...?
994 2018-09-10 21:49:57 Lol Venezuela with largest oil reserves in the world
995 2018-09-10 21:49:54 This is how the future will be if you don’t pull your head out from up the arseholes of the oil and meat industries and bring in new goals for climate change #wakeupdonaldtrump

997 2018-09-10 21:49:41 God bless bio oil 
998 2018-09-10 21:49:37 10 years ago, Alberta had a large  Heritage Fund but the previous Conservative governments spent it all before Notley's government was elected; thus they had little cash to use to soften the blow of low oil prices.

1001 2018-09-10 21:49:08 Now you're cooking with olive oil, I knew you had it in you pal.
1002 2018-09-10 21:49:08 Rainforests are being destroyed everyday for palm oil, which is used in much of the food we eat today. Just by checking ingredients on food you buy everyday can make an impact on preserving our rainforest and force big companies to make a change. #nomoredoritos #jmsshpacgw
1003 2018-09-10 21:49:03 Thank god for Russia . They have balanced the geopolitical power and are checking Western imperialism. That’s why the neoliberals hate Russia. Putin is stopping their wars of destruction for oil and natural resources for the oligarchs.
1004 2018-09-10 21:48:51 Also I prefer Armstrong in midfield than McDonald. McDonald turns like an oil tanker. Armstrong more dynamic going forward and looks a lot more comfortable on the ball.
1005 2018-09-10 21:48:39 and two of the largest oil refineries owned by the VEN government..........are located in the United States......go figure...
1006 2018-09-10 21:48:28 2. If $IMS ends without enough cheep oil in gold, how are we going to rebuild and take care of the mess and mismanagement created in the last almost 100 years?
1007 2018-09-10 21:48:27 It still makes my head spin that when I was being harassed over my medical needs gofundme, someone had the absolute stupidity to come at me with “she wants us to pay for her weed, why can’t she buy it like the rest of us have to!” when I had CBD oil listed as one of my meds loool
1008 2018-09-10 21:48:21 just cut out carby food, cook meat, green veg, add cheese, drink coffee, use butter, olive oil, nuts

1019 2018-09-10 21:46:19 The Trump admin is planning to open up BLM land to new oil drilling and fracking, including on all of Vandenberg AFB.  The State of CA and the counties will block the transportation of oil on public roads or by new pipelines.
1020 2018-09-10 21:46:17 Thanks so much I love that you hardly need any oil to make this!
1021 2018-09-10 21:46:12 Check your Engine oil this Sunday.
1022 2018-09-10 21:46:09 Excellent piece, Charles. You've got Sasse's number. He's as devious, craven and insincere as the rest of his party but he's selling a slightly more subtle form of snake oil and "slightly more subtle" seems enough for the likes of Chuck Todd.
1023 2018-09-10 21:46:08 Er, I don't really like them. Crown Prince has some that are packed in olive oil...
1024 2018-09-10 21:46:05 Except - uh - actually - they do die and are dieing. Offsets in California cap-and-trade are a loophole that allows Bio Oil to keep polluting - and Big Timber to keep logging. The carbon market is a case study in environmental racism and a greenwashing of business as usual.
1025 2018-09-10 21:45:16 We don’t appreciate coconut oil until our hair is fried and dryer than the desert
1026 2018-09-10 21:44:58 I'd love to cover you in virgin coconut oil.
Then devour you.

1027 2018-09-10 21:44:43 Due to some issues arised due to restriction of sanctions from usa on iran indian oil companies were not able to pay to for their imports. And as now the restriction are relaxed oil companies have already made the payment for these. So stop spreading rumors.
1028 2018-09-10 21:44:38 I got powdered lime flavour and it's great. It is actual lime oil and natural lime flavour but preserves better. I love lemon water so it's pretty good!

1034 2018-09-10 21:44:05 Neutralize the vinegar by soaking it in baking soda and water or it'll get even more rusty. Never soak the handle in vinegar or water. Use gun oil or 3 in 1 oil on the knife to protect it from rust. Only use vinegar to remove rust.
1035 2018-09-10 21:44:04 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.

1038 2018-09-10 21:43:30 The insane headache I’ve had all day is trying to make me vomit and I want my cbd oil money back.
1039 2018-09-10 21:43:29 I've just ordered some CBD oil, as I recently realised I've possibly been experiencing seizures since childhood () and tbh I'm completely terrified of prescription epilepsy meds. I'll be really curious to see if it works better for me than straight MMJ.
1040 2018-09-10 21:43:20 i really contemplated just going to get an oil change so they’d do it for me
1041 2018-09-10 21:43:04 Gabby, how did you know ? If you bring propaganda in agric, it will not help you at all. 

I'm into cocoa, oil palm and poultry. Feed costs have increased dramatically ( dollar influence), stop lieing. 

Do your politics and stop lieing.

1044 2018-09-10 21:42:51 Olive oil is a good lube for hand jobs since your girlfriend is Rosy Palm.
1045 2018-09-10 21:42:46 I’m going to teach my daughter how to change oil etc mainly because my dad did the same to my older sister. Idk I just think they’re handy skills for anyone to have
1046 2018-09-10 21:42:43 One half of my pillow has lavender drops on it the other olbas oil. A cacophony of aromas for the olfactory sense, in the hope of a peaceful sleep.
1047 2018-09-10 21:42:40 It is fascinating. But not sure it’s a result of previous conflicts. More likely the (inevitable?) conflict when liberal populations meet large scale oil and gas development. Similar efforts have emerged in other locales (Denton, LA, etc) with similar dynamics
1048 2018-09-10 21:42:37 VEN problem was/is that its fortunes depended only on the price of crude oil and during times of high prices, the govt 'helped' the poor to the extent that during times of low prices, the government went broke.
1049 2018-09-10 21:42:35 Couple of eggs, little lemon juice, olive oil , little salt, and whisk like crazy! Best mayo on Earth.  :-)
1050 2018-09-10 21:42:31 IMO, @drtwofive would be wise to take a fair number on a bridge and get to camp. Bet on himself, hope the market continues to overpay guys and he will get his in short order. The HR isn't coming now and getting off to a slow start will only hurt him in the long run. #Oilers
1051 2018-09-10 21:42:16 Several reasons 1) the Troika gave it more room to breath (unprecedented QE solutions applied, friendly-fiddling w debt figures) 2) low oil prices + tourist boom + non-austerity sponsoring (but not openly anti-austerity) gov meant more money being spent
1052 2018-09-10 21:41:58 I co-own an olive oil company is an incredibly soft brag

1056 2018-09-10 21:41:25 Is 'revenue hit' the only consideration? FM had raised taxes when oil prices fell 59% in 2015-16. Now he has a moral and legal responsibility to reduce same. Fleecing people to fulfill idiotic projects like you bullet train or buying arms we don't have the guts to use foolish.

1060 2018-09-10 21:41:02 So, in spring I bought an oil radiator with a timer on it, and yesterday I plugged it in and set the timer to make the bedroom warm just before I head up to bed, because I'm basically a predictable clockwork cat these days.

It is the best thing ever.

1063 2018-09-10 21:40:39 It does reek of collusion so undoubtedly will be newly cast by the loyal fans as part of the big oil, Koch, short seller conspiracy theory as to why teslas balance sheet is a horror.
1064 2018-09-10 21:40:39 Now here's the thing. Owls feathers are coated in an oil that makes them waterproof. Stroke them (or let your cat lick them) and the oil gets removed. Result - a soggy owl that can't fly.
Apologies for spoiling the mood.

1070 2018-09-10 21:40:06 I am capitalism and the Arab Revolutions are dangerous because the region is now in a position to export both oil and revolution.

1087 2018-09-10 21:37:25 I stand corrected on that. Was because of the oil crisis in 74. Was before my time and I thought the 3 day week was during the winter of discontent. So I take that one back.

1096 2018-09-10 21:36:09 There's a factor left out. 1$ pizza is obviously no comparison to the old style olive oil, excellent tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese. But it's a dollar and brings back memories of when money was easier. Lol! The old, good life.
1097 2018-09-10 21:36:08 actually....no...the country for 45 years was only dependent on oil production for both income & foreign currency & was fully nationalized in 2007. And USA is still the largest single buyer (26.6%) of VEN crude.

Sorry,but it's more govt white people being shitty to native Americans because they can. ..
1118 2018-09-10 21:33:08 You can oil pull at any time of the day.
1119 2018-09-10 21:33:08 おはようございます(*^^*)

1121 2018-09-10 21:32:47 IM NEVER GOING TO TRY OIL PAINTING EVER AGAIN I HAVE OIL PAINT EVERYWHERE :)))
1122 2018-09-10 21:32:41 1. Squeal or grumble?

I was under the impression that flange squeal was on the outer rail. You get grumbling because of the fixed axle and one wheel slipping.

3. Oil is cheaper than repairs.
1123 2018-09-10 21:32:36 Oil of Olay lol
1124 2018-09-10 21:32:20 Use baby oil 
1125 2018-09-10 21:32:19 This is a 24 x 36 oil on linen painting that I enjoyed working on. What we needed to do is take a head shot from a separate photo and work it into this piano scene. Otherwise, it was pretty straight forward. Something like this portrait takes me about 1.75 weeks to finish.
1126 2018-09-10 21:32:01 Why is canola oil not an essential oil?
1127 2018-09-10 21:31:56 Permanent marker. Make a mark on the inside of the gathered elastic on the bottom 2 corners. Never let govt do for you that you can do yourself....

1131 2018-09-10 21:31:32 I'm fine with none of the three making the team but do like the fact Hartnell has enjoyed success with Brodziak in recent years and the guy can still skate.
1132 2018-09-10 21:31:28 “I co-own an olive oil company” is my new favourite power move
1133 2018-09-10 21:31:26 Sorry but my mom doesn't have any connections to the oil industry
1134 2018-09-10 21:31:16 Paid my rent up til January, got an oil change, and now headed to get a car wash... 
1135 2018-09-10 21:31:15 What happens if you use expired castor oil on eyelashes? Is it harmful?
1136 2018-09-10 21:31:04 Yes, a lot of these projects were embarked upon before the National crisis. Most states coudn't pay salaries. Infact most states in Nigeria are not currently viable and my guess is that they will not be able to pay salaries in the future if we rely solely on oil.
1137 2018-09-10 21:30:59 JEFFERY ITS MY OPINION THAT THE PERPETUAL WARS ARE EVEN MORE SINISTER THAN BIG OIL.  ITS MY OPINION THAT MURDER INC.

1157 2018-09-10 21:28:49 @MSignorile my mother in law has the same problem with her feet and uses a cream with CBD oil in it and it's the best thing she's ever used for it
1158 2018-09-10 21:28:35 animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
1159 2018-09-10 21:28:30 Yes, excellent list to point out. People say they want to stop fossil fuels but yet use it every day. Will they also stop the oil production in the Los Angeles area? Or does that provide much needed tax revenue?
1160 2018-09-10 21:28:14 America is producing more oil domestically than we export from the ME. THAT’s why we can now control more of our foreign policy.
1161 2018-09-10 21:28:13 Don't need the weather app...I can just look at the consistency of the jar of coconut oil on my desk and the difference between last week and this week is STAGGERING!!!
1162 2018-09-10 21:28:05 bullish for oil, tbh
1163 2018-09-10 21:28:04 Apparently, due to construction issues relating to pipelines being halted, there is talk of separation from the ROC in Alberta. 

Alberta is playing hardball with their oil.
1164 2018-09-10 21:27:55 Of course, the US is complicit in keeping the Venezuelan people hungry. Next step, bomb shit out of them because "democracy," then swoop in a take their natural resources (oil). Classic US imperialist playbook action here.
1165 2018-09-10 21:27:42 1/ Ok approx 500g red pepper, 4 red chillis 5 cloves garlic put in roasting tin with generous splash of olive oil, roast on medium till soft.

1166 2018-09-10 21:27:42 I mean shoot. I can do that too. I'll go watch some YouTube videos and take care of it. Weh di beard oil deh? Let's do this.
1167 2018-09-10 21:27:37 And if you’re drying mint, use it generously with grated halloumi over pasta, and a dash of olive oil. A very delicious alternative to pesto.
1168 2018-09-10 21:27:31 Gotta get a oil change
1169 2018-09-10 21:27:29 There are alternatives to gas and oil you know
1170 2018-09-10 21:27:25 Obviously you don't understand the differences between Norwegian equity model and the royalty regime of the oil sands or the purpose thereof.
And by the way the world is increasing it's use of oil not moving away from it but carry on...

1177 2018-09-10 21:26:44 Bio oil?
1178 2018-09-10 21:26:34 That's my thinking too, but stranger things have happened. Chiasson has been with Gulutzan in both Dallas and Calgary, so there is familiarity working in his favour.
1179 2018-09-10 21:26:31 Oil prices were mixed Monday,pulling back from an early rally after data suggests U.S. crude inventories might expand, weighing on the market.
1180 2018-09-10 21:26:29 God bless you my broda. I am certain this wont taste good. Raw oil.... Feedback is a gift biko.

1190 2018-09-10 21:24:19 @JimCarrey hey! Wanna start your socialism? Give away a couple of millions to my account. Like chavez did with our oil giving it away to other countries. I'm from Venezuela btw
1191 2018-09-10 21:24:18 Getting an oil change and they have my car elevated no lie like ten feet in the air is that NORMAL!!!???
1192 2018-09-10 21:24:16 He was there for the oil, he finished his job and another agent will replace him, same old stuff. While evil and foreigners are in Somalia, nothing will change
1193 2018-09-10 21:24:15 There's another greed is after and it will destroy the natural habitat. Guyana oil. Also Guyana has one of the last natural rainforests in the world. It's like Madagascar. First the gold, the oil then the rainforest.
1194 2018-09-10 21:24:10 When dealing with finite resources like coal, oil and gas it is important to adopt an intertemporal strategy. That is a strategy that looks into the future so as to adequately and wisely utilize the income or revenue realized from these finite resources.
1195 2018-09-10 21:24:00 The abundance of oil and natural gas in the Eagle Ford Shale creates tremendous economic opportunities for local communities.
1196 2018-09-10 21:23:53 Actually I don't clean it much my son does, he is a policeman of 18 years and he has an awesome cleaning kit I bought him for his birthday yrs & yrs ago. He is faster and more detailed.  I do clean &amp; oil it after the firing range if he's too busy.
1197 2018-09-10 21:23:34 Upshall is the only one of interest as a 4th line guy and penalty killer.
1198 2018-09-10 21:23:30 I don’t want my high took away. I want all the benefits. Helps me sleep high. So I don’t need to take my CBD oil at bedtime?
1199 2018-09-10 21:23:24 Many a documentary on that one. It’s because the USD is how most countries pay for oil. Which many economists say might be coming to an end. The US has borrowed heavily on the fact it is the world benchmark, but again that time might be coming to an end soon. #cdnpoli
1200 2018-09-10 21:23:14 The cheviot, the oil and the black, black stag.
1201 2018-09-10 21:23:08 The sesame oil is negligible, most of it will wind up dripping off. But this cut is super lean. How are you adding fat to it?
1202 2018-09-10 21:23:04 めっちゃ気持ちいい
1203 2018-09-10 21:23:01 You are wrong, the nicaraguan people is crying for help, crying for democracy and asking for assistance from the world.  Has nothing to do with oil, but to have a Nicaragua libre from oppression
1204 2018-09-10 21:22:55 Ameen yaa Allah
1205 2018-09-10 21:22:46 Don't be mean. Poor guy was nervous. Also he got olive oil on his gun.

1208 2018-09-10 21:22:28 JMJ! Potus not informed,ya think! Now oil co attacked. Thanks but you scared me. KSA & Israel-no surprise.
1209 2018-09-10 21:22:18 What’s the humongous oil energy cost to research, discover, extract, transport, refine, transport to fuelling station! These figures are conveniently forgotten within any direct comparison 
1210 2018-09-10 21:22:06 $10 off on this oil change just made my day.. its the little things fr lol
1211 2018-09-10 21:21:52 There is no worse form of purgatory than waiting for your car's oil change at Walmart

1213 2018-09-10 21:21:50 Let's all pay muuuch more for gasoline and heating oil, said the GOP. Just in time for the midterm election. They want lose, obviously.

1215 2018-09-10 21:21:31 How is Tesla actively screwing Saudi oil revenue? Where do you think the energy for the superchargers come from?
1216 2018-09-10 21:21:21 For sore joints I reccomend Seaweed and Arnica bath oil by Neals yard..Bit pricey but worked magic on my shoulder

1218 2018-09-10 21:20:56 In their heyday the attendance was solid but unfortunately for them, it was right in the middle of the Oilers and Eskimos dynasties. Edmonton baseball fans knew how great the product was but average joe had no clue and it really is too bad.

1222 2018-09-10 21:20:32 Brunei is also oil rich and only has 400,000 people, if they didn't have 'low debt levels' and 'free healthcare' it would have to be an absolutely absurd place
1223 2018-09-10 21:20:30 He sells snake oil
1224 2018-09-10 21:20:17 His decision to take Tesla private has nothing to do with investors trying to cash in on that decision. Saudi backing? Saudi wants to back the company that's actively screwing their oil revenue? What are you even saying?

Awesome! I didn't tell him that I'm going to sub back in my VO and Water. Next year will be Liver concerns, no doubt.
1228 2018-09-10 21:19:44 No, just one of those opportunistic photos on the street that you bought. Unless a man who drove a Maxol truck and delivered home central heating oil was a celeb!
1229 2018-09-10 21:19:39 This made new to many and specially those that weren't watching how the deal was done. I Remember that govt went to private market for bidding to explore long-term contracted price for LNG. This in a market unlike oil where LNG is sold first & produced later. Kudos 2 PMLN
1230 2018-09-10 21:19:38 I thought it was Mobil 1 oil oo
Tell me something man 
1231 2018-09-10 21:19:38 Teacher tip: Don't wipe a whiteboard with your hands. The oil from your fingers will be absorbed by the marker and render it useless.
1232 2018-09-10 21:19:27 They should be the first ones to take a pay cut in order to make up for lost revenues from oil to pay down debt
1233 2018-09-10 21:19:18 #TheFive Maxine is well known for saying that she's like to nationalize the oil companies
1234 2018-09-10 21:19:12 Do you usually lotion after you shower? Your body compensates for dry skin by secreting excess oil to keep you hydrated throughout the day. And swearing a lot doesn’t help either

1237 2018-09-10 21:18:36 Precisely Kiran. No one knows.

No one knows what the price of oil will be,

No one knows what the £ will do.

The whole thing is a dangerous, self-harming gamble.
1238 2018-09-10 21:18:35 And what traditions pray tell have you and your snake oil boss honored? Have you for example:
Fostered honesty?
Tried to bring Americans together?
Acted with respect & dignity?
Represented all American fairly?
Improved democratic values?
Promulgated the constitution?
Bipartisan?

He might as well make her do some of the work
1241 2018-09-10 21:18:00 If @TheDemocrats, or any other political party, wants to turn Texas blue, green, gold or purple, the impact of the oil and natural gas industries on the economy, the recovery of Texas ports from #Harvey, the condition of the Texas infrastructure, the rise of atheists,....
1242 2018-09-10 21:17:54  come to think of it where can one buy  this beard oil....asking for meself..
1243 2018-09-10 21:17:41 Scotland gets a *geographic* share of oil income. That is a lot more than 8%. So you are misinformed. Again.
1244 2018-09-10 21:17:40 2 hours and a half for a damn oil change wtf!!
1245 2018-09-10 21:17:30 Can the annoyed oil swing?
1246 2018-09-10 21:17:17 Pipeline limitations are driving down local prices for oil and natural gas, causing drilling activity to flatten.

1247 2018-09-10 21:17:13 Lol Wala. Daw baby oil lang gid sya sa feeling. Tapos moisturizer man sya. 7 months nko gagamit, never nag peel akon skin sa oil.
1248 2018-09-10 21:17:03 Self harm to who ? You rich twats coz big buissness is nt running the show for once ? Do us a faviour borrow that vest off boris and press the button while thinking about the hundreds of thousands of people who have died since you found them womd ? (Wedges oil money darling)
1249 2018-09-10 21:16:56 was it 'If olive oil comes from olives, where does baby oil come from?'
1250 2018-09-10 21:16:55 Roasted beetroot is amazing, or also makes a great dip if you cook it and blend with butter beans, garlic and loads of olive oil
1251 2018-09-10 21:16:50 Well, yes...inflation is very high. Some of this is too much reliance on imports, a lot of it is right wing businessmen flooding the economy with Bolivars, and not a little to do with the recent crash in oil prices and US economic sanctions.
1252 2018-09-10 21:16:47 Pol = petroleum oil and lubricants?
Wow. Which element of pol do you most identify with? Let me guess: gas! It has to be gas! (Short for gas-lighting, again)
1253 2018-09-10 21:16:42 thc oil is trash
1254 2018-09-10 21:16:35 @candykittens hydrogenated sunflower oil - seriously?!?!? Don’t think I’ll be getting any more.

1258 2018-09-10 21:15:49 The Venezuela my family comes from was beautiful and flowing with oil and tourists. now my family left there can't get food, medicine or protection from street thugs. It is insane this is the same country.

1262 2018-09-10 21:15:09 i need an oil change and like 2 new tires 
1263 2018-09-10 21:14:58 It can if proper studies are conducted and strong systems are created and implemented, then yes the some of the funding from our oil can fuel the fight against Domestic Violence. We have to get everyone involved starting with the kids. This is everyone's business. Im sick of it!
1264 2018-09-10 21:14:52 We are already dying? What left more ? Our Air,Water and Food already got so much polluted, Food we eating full of chemical with heavy metals @BJP4India @PMOIndia @rsprasad  it will better Rs1000 a litre oil( petrol/diesel) Road vehicles will get reduced ,Air will less polluted
1265 2018-09-10 21:14:46 MY observation is that "pure" Orange Juice isn't pure NOW tang or other artificial orange with sugar is being mixed in. Soy oil mixed into peanut Butter. What ever they can do to disguise contaminating FOOD.  Smoked, sweetened, salted & over spiced to cover the poison. sad!
1266 2018-09-10 21:14:32 They were a good team and I thought they drew good attendance. I'd think million+ cities with an appetite for ball would be in demand.
1267 2018-09-10 21:14:21 @sjandrews76 Do you drive a car, fly anywhere, cook,  use air conditioning, heat and light your home with gas or electricity? If so you are supporting oil and gas companies. Make a stand for what you believe in or keep quiet.
1268 2018-09-10 21:14:16 Nigga i know my tires are bad, I didn’t come here for that. I came here for an oil change so change my mf oil 
1269 2018-09-10 21:14:10 Maybe Lucas Oil. she only had one show who had more than 60k this tour, so that's why i'm thinking she won't break the other attendance records.
1270 2018-09-10 21:14:02 oh cool argan oil irritates my skin just like honey :/
1271 2018-09-10 21:13:53 I always put chestnuts in a jar on a window and it keeps them out. Same with tea tree oil. Didn’t have any spiders in the house last year. They don’t like the smell. Only got rid of last years today and boom. Back

1274 2018-09-10 21:13:15 Once a month for olive oil, every two months with one of those big bottles of fish sauce.
1275 2018-09-10 21:13:14 Thoose Moslems started it! THEY SHOULD HAVE NOT REJECTED OUR KIND OFFER TO COME THERE AND TAKE THE OIL AND THE GAS

1282 2018-09-10 21:12:35 @Swamy39 how do u justify the oil price in india ?
1283 2018-09-10 21:12:20 President Kiir's idea to pay foreign constructors with crude oil to curve corruption is a brilliant idea.
1284 2018-09-10 21:12:15 They also own the main oil company. We don't.
1285 2018-09-10 21:12:12 one of these days Ken is going to take up the baton on Westminster's Scottish Oil theft, or mibbe not considering labours fingerprints are all over it, more than once.
1286 2018-09-10 21:12:06 You aren't doing "good" fats like heavy whipping cream, coconut oil, avocado etc? When I went keto that's what happened to me I wasn't eating enough fats to burn for energy for the first week. Once I did that I was $$$
1287 2018-09-10 21:12:04 Potatoes are easy to make. Salt, pepper, olive oil. Batteries and candles. Keep me posted, love.
1288 2018-09-10 21:12:02 @BJP4India , it's hard time to make the people in more confidence ! Oil price correction is very important ,irrespective of any justification !
1289 2018-09-10 21:11:55 Norway did partially model their fund after Alberta's. Alberta's oil is landlocked which limits the price the oil is valued at. Norway ships 80% of their oil production to shore by tanker and then 80% of total production is exported to global markets. Market access works wonders!
1290 2018-09-10 21:11:51 The video is unprocessed, raw HD video.  The green is the result of a combination of environmental elements and it is generally a turbid area enhanced with oil being present.  Data is being processed from the vehicles onboard sensors TBD.
1291 2018-09-10 21:11:36 IMHO the motive for 9/11 was/is to bring the American people to accept war.

The wars of 9/11 are about

- money for the military industrial complex,

- control of resources (oil, pipelines),

- control of Eurasia (“Geo strategy”),

- destruction of the enemies of Israel.
1292 2018-09-10 21:11:27 @coopukfood not one single loaf of bread for sale in Lauder without palm oil. Why??
1293 2018-09-10 21:11:25 Because in the 70s UK was bankrupt. The oil saved us.
1294 2018-09-10 21:11:16 Bruh the wonders this olive oil, honey and lemon mix I made to use on my have have been working , my face was so dry until now .
1295 2018-09-10 21:11:08 The Cafe Mac Pizza of the day will be: burnt crust with sad motor oil and apple wood smoked bacon.
1296 2018-09-10 21:11:02 Palm Oil is not sustainable. The amount of rainforest cleared for this industry is ever expanding. It’s a terrible industry probably responsible for more extinctions than any other, and most we don’t even know about. Disgusting.
1297 2018-09-10 21:10:51 Oh, sure. But it's easy to forget that the $/oil/inflation vicious cycle of 2006-H1 2008 exacerbated the economic downturn as well. The reality is that "neutral" is such a broad range that managing policy to it is much more art than science, equations be damned...
1298 2018-09-10 21:10:48 After attacking Jennie from BP they came for BTS and they added oil on the fire to see some other fanWars between immature EXO and Army. We really need to shut them down ! They are the most annoying thing in this world 
1299 2018-09-10 21:10:39 apHogee is really good. After using their shampoo, conditioner, and moisturizer, all I really ever need is black castor oil to keep it from getting dry throughout the week
1300 2018-09-10 21:10:27 This is the global banking agenda. They have stolen all the gold, control access to the oil, and make nations pay with petrodollars. Politics is the result of their agenda, not the cause. We have no vote in this global corporation except how we spend our $.
1301 2018-09-10 21:10:23 What you're seeing is actually a mixture of oil and crumbs that can sometimes form during packaging and it is not peanut based. Please DM us the UPC code, expiration date with the letters & numbers that follow. Thanks.
1302 2018-09-10 21:10:22 You stated that by definition, medical cannabis is high THC ... this is incorrect & was my main point. That statement could deter ppl from asking their Drs for cannabis.

In fact, in Canada most seniors assessed are prescribed CBD-rich oil & strains not THC.
1303 2018-09-10 21:10:20 If you have locs do not use any products in you hair.
To wash use the ACV method. 
To retwist use castor oil & water.

1312 2018-09-10 21:09:14 However, what H2 means is that petrochemical companies can keep supplying energy stored in tanks, generated from natural gas, oil and coal, and transporting it to expensive filling stations for consumers to fuel up. It's about maintaining the status quo.
1313 2018-09-10 21:09:12 Got a discount on my oil change cause homeboy drives a jeep too #ganggang
1314 2018-09-10 21:09:09 The media statement is correct but poorly phrased. The price correlation between spot and inventories is strongest when considering both crude oil & petroleum products together. Crude inventories at refineries are essentially exchangeable with product in a monthly time frame.
1315 2018-09-10 21:09:05 It is all about the Wests desire to control the oil! Total BS about the CW use by anyone other than the deep state
1316 2018-09-10 21:09:05 Good thing about this oil change is I get to play while waiting for the oil to completely drain
1317 2018-09-10 21:09:04 Trudeau said " Oil Sands Will Be Fased Out" . He changed the rules for NEB, he is bringing in a new Bill to tighten regulations even futher. The courts are one sided. How can people believe he wants to actually build the expansion.
1318 2018-09-10 21:08:55 In other news I have appalling sinusitis and just inhaled so much olbas oil I could feel it in my right eyeball. Presuming I get to sleep I reckon my dreams are going to be cosmic.

1336 2018-09-10 21:05:30 Right,in Venezuela the oil belongs to the People,but politicians steal so much the people are starving.  First they took the guns, then the PC crowd took over and you couldn’t talk...
1337 2018-09-10 21:05:27 The go-to reaction is that anyone "denying" climate change is a paid shill for the oil companies, or simply a dupe. 
In the past, we were sold things under the guise of "science" — cigarettes, for example, were hailed as beneficial. If they can dress it up in a lab coat…
1338 2018-09-10 21:05:23 So far, can I use butter over oil for a firmer mix? Could I use oats in it?

1340 2018-09-10 21:04:55 Litre a month of olive oil. Small bottle of Squid Brand every few months probably.
1341 2018-09-10 21:04:49 It has been discovered why Atlantis sank. Oil floats on water so if you have oil in your soil you will float. Thousands of years ago the big oil producers pumped out all the oil in Atlantis. No oil no floating. No floating you sink.
1342 2018-09-10 21:04:47 thank you #oil_baron for the key!

1345 2018-09-10 21:04:22 You can drop off used oil at an oil change place and they’ll dispose for free. Much cheaper to change my own than pay $50 or so for a quick change to do it.

1348 2018-09-10 21:03:58 Cannabis oil helps amazingly for me too. I just ordered some ‘No Salt’ to make my hydration concoction for POTS/OI. The other thing that makes a huge difference to muscle capacity and general fatigue is the C0Q10 - great PEM buster! (taken before and after activity)
1349 2018-09-10 21:03:42 2012-13 me crude oil ke daam 110 dollar per barrel the aaj 90 hai

1352 2018-09-10 21:03:01 At what point would you change perspective and consider maybe the pension funds, insurance companies, oil companies, shipping companies and scientists know something i dont?
1353 2018-09-10 21:02:58 They are both equal in my book. Neither one of them have a progressive vision for Alaska. 

Both have a private platform and a public platform. They both serve the oil companies and donors.
1354 2018-09-10 21:02:56 Really? I thought that being a "Snake oil seller" was a qualification to run for any office.
1355 2018-09-10 21:02:40 I'm not talking about allowing. Would you like to drive a track with 2 meters to the barrier and random oil spill?

What isn't true please enlightened me.
1385 2018-09-10 20:58:35 Yes, because we have had dummies preventing our oil to get to port we are forced to sell it dirt cheap to the US, they are basically our only buyer.  Oil is not subsidized in every country it's in, just stupid ones like Canada...
1386 2018-09-10 20:58:28 Meanwhile, with lots of oil as well socialist Norwegians must be loving their country for doing so well. Real democracy/leadership (and not socialism itself) makes a huge difference.

1390 2018-09-10 20:57:58 @andysindianfood been looking for an expert on safe cooking oils our great indian grandparents used prior to harmful refined veg oils. think I have found it. what are your views on refined rapeseed oil?
1391 2018-09-10 20:57:55 What’s a good oil control face wash? cause my skin is just ugh rn
1392 2018-09-10 20:57:49 Girlie o, if I break your heart na oil spillage.. I study this your love for freedom college, Nne you too sweet like yam porridge.. 
1393 2018-09-10 20:57:33 Yes... and THC is being found to be essential for pain modulations as well. The more studies and work that is able to be done on this the more it’s found that THC and CBD work best together. I have an oil of each so I can blend - less CBD and more THC for sleep 
1394 2018-09-10 20:57:31 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.

1396 2018-09-10 20:57:20 One Noteworthy point here is - Even if crude oil market price is 78$ per barrel. That doesn’t mean India buys at that price. It’s price is relatively lower based on long term contracts with countries like Iran. So India’s crude purchase price basket will be lower by 12$ atleast!
1397 2018-09-10 20:57:15 Bt where the actual problem is petrol price depends on the crude oil price which was around 106$ at the time of Congress &we were getting petrol at cost of 56 Rpl as the crude oil price has been reduced by 30% Which is around 69$Then where is this hike coming from?

1403 2018-09-10 20:56:39 Oil to make his face to shine.
" Psalm 104:15 "
Wisdom maketh his FACE to SHINE." 
 OIL is also likened unto "WISDOM".

 "this is your wisdom & your understanding in Th sight of Th Nations." 
Deut. 4:6. 
Also "Th man of wisdom shall see Thy name."

1411 2018-09-10 20:56:10 get u a dad who changes your oil and puts a new headlight in for you >>>>
1412 2018-09-10 20:56:10 You haven't been paying attention.  He wants the states to pay for almost everything.  He also wants to open up every industry that polluted, coal, fracking, off-shore oil etc.  He's a cancer of the worst kind.
1413 2018-09-10 20:55:58 Hopefully, they buy some Alberta oil to burn.
1414 2018-09-10 20:55:57 Kudlow, please return to Fox, where you can continue to sell your snake oil! In the White House you should act like a statesman and you’re not. The economic boom is still Obama, not Trump’s with his tax cut to the rich and himself.
1415 2018-09-10 20:55:42 They changed the recipe of the UK one and now it's shite. Same with Mars and a few others. Too much oil in the chocolate.

1418 2018-09-10 20:55:12 Oil companies: We want to keep extracting oil and we don’t care who dies.

Centrists: That doesn’t sound nice. How about just the global south dies?
1419 2018-09-10 20:55:11 Don’t forget, with electric car you are workshops harassment free , thanks to the simplicity of the electric  cars,  where you don’t have to pay visit to the workshop and go through the hassle of replacement parts , checks , oil leaks and occasionally the  mechanical failure.
1420 2018-09-10 20:55:10 Really ? How's that it's working in Norway ?
Norway has a TRILLION dollar oil state fund, you and magash*ts can only dream of.
1421 2018-09-10 20:55:10 No you dickhead. A loan (the type that an oil company would get or can get) would be from institution or someone crazy enough lend 2 lakh crore, while a bond is a open market debt instrument that is due at a specific time. Hence, public's money has to be paid in full at maturity.
1422 2018-09-10 20:55:04 This is very misleading unfortunately. It shows percentage
movement of local petro prices since 2004 which escalated in % terms. However it does not correlate to changes in the international oil prices which, if shown defeats the argument.

1432 2018-09-10 20:54:20 This is explicitly moving the goalposts, but California doesn't have 27 years, they have 5-7.  Maybe less given the Iranian attacks on Iraq.    

Because in 5-7 years, their oil *supplies* will be entirely cut off. And the rest of the country won't be able to help.
1433 2018-09-10 20:54:19 Good article. Strong demand & stable prices are a good thing! Investors may be reassessing however industry is happy with stability. Range bound oil allows allows continued investment.

1445 2018-09-10 20:53:29 I heard that the oil producing communities are from this senatorial district. & they are not in national grid, this is wickedness .

You @YemieFASH what did your party did for them since all these years?

1456 2018-09-10 20:52:37 Absolutely brilliant! Thinly slice, a tablespoon of olive oil for every two onions, 1/4 tsp of salt for every two onions. Leave them all day. If there is a lot of liquid you can leave lid off for a bit to get rid, if you want to.
1457 2018-09-10 20:52:34 Which in case of Trudeau is deep departure from his father who was willing to implement radical economic and political reforms (wage and price control, oil nationalization, new constitution) while hewing to the center.

1472 2018-09-10 20:50:15 Take away my car, take me off the insurance! I’m done with paying for all this car stuff!

1473 2018-09-10 20:49:57 Sounds like fucking wonderful writing. That's really cool. Guyana has a massive diaspora. Cities like London, New York, Toronto especially, have a Guyanese backbone. Be interesting to see it all this oil means anyone heads back to S America

1482 2018-09-10 20:48:34 What she want? Doctors to have chainsaws and mining equipment? Meant to be performing surgery on a human not drilling for oil.
1483 2018-09-10 20:48:31 Trump takes credit for the economy without any knowledge of what driving it. 
He’s pushing coal, while sustainable energy is the future. 
He’s pushing oil and gas exploration in pristine and fragile ecosystems, while the world is protecting theirs. 

He’s totally out of touch!!
1484 2018-09-10 20:48:24 Certamente! I'm going to start bringing back De Cecco pasta, Lavazza coffee, balsamic vinegar, extra-virgin olive oil, risotto rice, parmigiano reggiano ... when the shelves are empty, you can all come here for a good "spaghettata" and a decent cup of coffee.

1486 2018-09-10 20:47:45 Can't even seem to move forward with 1/3 of their lucrative oil blocks. An oil company has dragged Gambia to international court and the outcome is uncertain to say the least. Not to mention the delays and deterring effects it will have...
1487 2018-09-10 20:47:37 I agree Kale is garnish, coconut oil is for people’s hair
1488 2018-09-10 20:47:27 All those charts were cherry picked to contrast selected economic series that clustered around the oil shock of late 2014/early 2015. Short term decline during the crisis and the eventual back to normal trend. Very deceiving (dishonest).
1489 2018-09-10 20:47:04 Curious. WHY? Why is he a snake oil salesman? What specifically has he done for you to label him that?

1496 2018-09-10 20:45:59 Just cause I don't eat a meat only diet doesn't mean I eat oil and refined sugar my man, totes agree with you on those counts.
1497 2018-09-10 20:45:45 Corporate decimation of forests isn't going to replace $60/barrel oil. AK isn't going to be able to live off oil money ever again. Allowing timber/mining to profit off the land will adversely affect tourism and it won't help #alaskans

1515 2018-09-10 20:43:50 Atleast you’re being honest. Can we agree that corruption plays a massive role in the economy of Nigeria? Just like oil windfall, the more money government officials graft, the happier the Nigerian populace are; Just adjust to the situation....ok?
1516 2018-09-10 20:43:47 That all sounds like very good advice. I’d try and avoid more than three days on the bounce. Five days training a week. Sunday for the long run.

1584 2018-09-10 20:35:03 You can never have too many pickles or tomatoes. I used to make tomato sauces and then discovered something amazing. Tomatoes cut in half, put on a skewer and grilled with a bit of olive oil and salt and pepper. It's ridiculously tasty on flatbread.

1649 2018-09-10 20:28:20 Thank you for passing this landmark bill, an important step in preserving a livable climate for all children! @MothersOutFront appreciate your support & hope you'll take the next step of freezing permits for new oil & gas drilling in CA & impose setback limits. #BrownsLastChance
1650 2018-09-10 20:28:15 The other day he mentioned developing the ANWR (the Artcic National Wildlife Refuge) and it made me sick. It’s the entire nation’s last, most pristine land reserve where scientific research and discoveries have only begun. But it sits atop oil reserves. ANWR belongs to everyone.
1651 2018-09-10 20:28:12 Отчасти знакомо. В детстве всё казалось намного лучше, чем было на самом деле. Но всё таки, даже понимая это, так хочется вернуться обратно, закрыться в комнате, достать свои игрушки, и окунуться в мир фантазий. Хотя мне даже сейчас особо и не на что жаловаться.
1652 2018-09-10 20:28:07 I always feel like a responsible adult after an oil change
1653 2018-09-10 20:27:58 My favorite is the oncologist pushing desserts 24/7 to combat cachexia...
Dude, those Duncan Hines brownies from a box made with soybean oil are NOT helping you fight that cancer. I can promise you that.
1654 2018-09-10 20:27:58 @elonmusk what do you think of levulinic acid and @GFBiochemicals. More specifically, the potential of methytetrahydrofuran, a derivative of levulinic acid, that can blend with oil. Is that a potential solution for now to the gasoline automobile? At least like enhancing it?
1655 2018-09-10 20:27:56 And trimming the oil lamps..
1656 2018-09-10 20:27:43 But if oil is down, no profit then no tax , then no money. Of course new fields can probably be found but now the SG wants to ban diesel and petrol vehicles , so........
1657 2018-09-10 20:27:42 Don’t mind me, just getting my oil changed with a body pillow in my cab
1658 2018-09-10 20:27:08 Gbam! Engineer kenan

1661 2018-09-10 20:26:43 Oh, neat! Now I imagine it's oil or natural gas.
1662 2018-09-10 20:26:33 “teeka” of bhabhi ji ghar par hai

1663 2018-09-10 20:26:32 @sugarsin Your watermelon vegan sweets are lovely but I can't buy another pack knowing that you use palm oil. What a paradox ay? Love animals, don't want to eat them but happy to desecrate their home and slaughter any animal in the way of a plantation.
1664 2018-09-10 20:26:28 do you have an air fryer? it’s awsome cause you use no oil but it still has the feel and taste to it like you drowned it in oil
1665 2018-09-10 20:26:26 Allah ya basu lada
1666 2018-09-10 20:26:25 No, crippling US sanctions, US forcing the price of oil down & CIA ops are the cause.
1667 2018-09-10 20:26:10 I’d asvise you to get caster oil and argan oil ASAP 
Your hair would grow back fast
1668 2018-09-10 20:26:09 I use olive oil and coconut oil  for everything..
1669 2018-09-10 20:26:08 Leave it to me to buy more oil on the train 
1670 2018-09-10 20:26:06 If Oil And Water Don’t Mix Then Being Messy And Anointed Won’t Either .
1671 2018-09-10 20:26:01 How long do you take to get vegetables ready to roast for dinner? You can cut the time way down by using Pictsweet roasting vegetables! They’re already cut for you, so all you need to do is add spices, oil, and roast!  #GotItFree, #PictsweetFarms, #LetsRoast, #RoastEmUp
1672 2018-09-10 20:25:56 Speaking of that address, i know the locality well. Next i show up. it will be with my relative Satish reddy for some good old time spanking for your dumb ass. please apply some cream and oil... gorre ga
1673 2018-09-10 20:25:48 still dying at "not anti oil"
1674 2018-09-10 20:25:42 i always used to worry about it but honestly it's like a counteraction so it will keep your skin moisturised and stop it producing as much oil 
1675 2018-09-10 20:25:30 You have Oil bots and trolls. Be careful in the future. I have some type of corporate contractor/spy at my house trying to attack me as much as possible without leaving too much evidence.  Its sad when dumb men attack women who are smarter than them.
1676 2018-09-10 20:25:17 Depends. I buy the largest olive oil I can store in my cupboard, and the smallest fish sauce I can find.
1677 2018-09-10 20:25:16 How about olive oil and Virgin olive oil.?   Makes one think.  Lol
1678 2018-09-10 20:25:15 A country where the rich list is filled with politicians, pastors, oil thieves is not a progressive country. They create zero jobs for the populace....
1679 2018-09-10 20:25:07 Hahaha since it’s an air fryer there’s no oil so you can slice a regular potato in there and it’ll turn into chips! It’s the oils that make chips unhealthy, an actual potato isn’t bad for you on its own!

1684 2018-09-10 20:24:45 Thanks man. I have a Bank of America account. What do I do when I need to get it here ? That's two transfers instead of one. Also some companies don't like paying international remote contractors via accounts on US oil

1687 2018-09-10 20:24:35 I buy olive oil maybe once a month but fish sauce.... have I ever replace the first bottle I bought?
1688 2018-09-10 20:24:33 Immigration, illegal-immigration, and forced mass-migration are all different things.

Not at all shocked that you're conveniently leaving the last two out, you disingenuous, cowardly cultist. Push your snake oil, and empty platitudes on someone else.
1689 2018-09-10 20:24:22 Traidor at estupido talaga si Duterte. He is selling out the sovereign rights of the Filipino people over trillions of dollars worth of oil, gas and other natural resources in the West Philippine Sea in exchange for a few billion dollars worth of Chinese loans.

1691 2018-09-10 20:24:07 It's a recipe when doing #Keto It's coffee, grass fed butter and MCT oil or Coconut oil. Have you knowledge of keto?
1692 2018-09-10 20:23:57 Wow, this Dark Matter (decarboxylated cannabis oil) from Astronoma can do wonders! Only $40 for this full plant extract at Burlingame!
1693 2018-09-10 20:23:16 The water look like oil. Wtf weather coming.
1694 2018-09-10 20:23:08 They cleverly didn’t include the crude oil prices. If included true status of petrol prices will be revealed.
1695 2018-09-10 20:23:04 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.
1696 2018-09-10 20:22:55 fruit flavored.strawberries, banana, blueberries, blackberries, rasberries, local honey, bee pollen, hemp seed oil, hemp seeds, yogurt. It actually IS really good for you and the local honey and pollen have gotten rid of our allergies. but i'd cut a bitch for a pizza right now :)
1697 2018-09-10 20:22:53 They own the factories. Solar panel production facilities cost in the range of $100 million. This is a corporate product just like coal, oil, gas. It's not inherently democratic or decentralized, that's a mythology.
1698 2018-09-10 20:22:48 CBD Oil helps all types of people if given the chance by you and i ... be patient it does help

1700 2018-09-10 20:21:58 Really good RNS, feel more relaxed now going forward, bring on the mighty Kim  not writing a speech, just going to ad-lib 
1701 2018-09-10 20:21:47 Exactly.. see how INC destroyed Indian oil companies. See the percentage growth of oil prices in $ and in ₹ for same times. Domestic rates were not increased in parallel to buying rates. This was the idea to bankrupt oil companies.
 @BJP4India
1702 2018-09-10 20:21:41 The more India is dependent on US dollar for example like IT service sector, oil and other needs India will continue to suffer. Be smart and have a vision of innovation and renewable energy. Until then Rupee be a puppet to US dollar! @timesofindia @the_hindu @PawanKalyan

1707 2018-09-10 20:21:22 Happy 25th Anniversary to The X-Files. I celebrated by drinking alien oil and snorting a bee up my nose. (That's X-Files stuff, right?) I don't feel so good.
1708 2018-09-10 20:21:20 March 2014:-
Petrol Price:Rs. 70
International Crude Oil: $107

September 2018:

This is organised loot and legalised plunder.

1709 2018-09-10 20:21:10 Wealth used to fund polluting industries such as fossil fuels ie coal crude oil should be subsumed into enterprises that celebrate true WEALTH which is the EARTH herself which is the source of all #loveearth #climatechange
1710 2018-09-10 20:21:09 Your volunteering your time for a person who is not going to do anything for you. Time is precious kid. Don't waste it on some snake oil salesman selling you fake dreams. I guess you'll just have to live and learn. SMH

1713 2018-09-10 20:20:58 S&P Platts analysts estimate the sanctions could take 1.4 million bpd of Iranian crude off the global market. Someone else will have to step in and pump more if prices are to stay within the current range. For most, this someone is Saudi Arabia

Goodbye To Cheap Oil… For Now
1714 2018-09-10 20:20:58 He has a 6-figure blog and lives in Eastern Europe and owns an olive oil company. And is so successful  that he could retire tomorrow, but instead chooses to selflessly help others have what he has thru a subscription e-mail service. He is - the least fictional man you know
1715 2018-09-10 20:20:52 Is that a bottle of oil? Hate to spill it

1719 2018-09-10 20:20:05 Hi there! We are working hard on having our IT Girls from around the world try the CC Oil Free Matte. Stay tuned as it is coming soon! XOXO
1720 2018-09-10 20:20:00 I am not the expert but I thought WTI is a better quality oil than Brent. In the past it was that WTI used to trade USD 2 - 4 above Brent. I guess the whole shale revolution changed that.
1721 2018-09-10 20:19:52 Like how states for decades have tried to encourage carpooling (beginning during the oil embargo), including writing in statute that you are not a common carrier if you accept remuneration up to the full cost of a trip, but are a common carrier if you turn a penny of profit. Smh
1722 2018-09-10 20:19:52 Looking for a few people (~ 3) attending the Oil Sands Trade Show in #YMM to split the costs of a @phxheliflight helicopter tour of the Oil Sands tomorrow morning. Any takers? #OST2018 @OilSandsShow

1731 2018-09-10 20:18:49 I need a haircut. Or a magic trick or something, everytime I have to wash my damaged ass hair it’s a process. Deep conditioning before I shower rebound shampoo then deep conditioner then leave in and oil when I get out I wait over night for it to dry just to flat iron
1732 2018-09-10 20:18:44 Nope. Theres a front Centre oil cooling rad that has its air channeled through bumper and then out of the top. On each front corner are water rads too, which blow through into front wheel arches where wheels are. And intercoolers are........
1733 2018-09-10 20:18:15 Even better!! Venezuela as an example? Largest oil reseves on the planet. NO food, NO medicines, No hospitals (private nor public), No education, NO private sector (almost zero), NO public transportation, NO cash money, NO Automotive parts in general, NO welfare progr.. etc.etc.
1734 2018-09-10 20:18:13 You need to push down on the cap as you turn it. If you go to a full service gas station they will check your oil. And your tires. For a fee. And the oil if you need it. Prayers and hugs
1735 2018-09-10 20:18:10 Ma'am you can do complaint.But With a so called forcefully "Bharat band" where a child died ,attacked on school buses, firing damage of public property. Is the the way to complaint?
Crude oil prices are high now days but it will be decrease..then any body return that child life ?
1736 2018-09-10 20:18:07 People STILL on this level of reasoning? Simple mindedness? Obviously. Comparing prices when we were swamped by imports vs. when we shut most of that down to encourage local industry. OR prices when were earning more than quadruple rev from oil vs. when it tanked. OR what?
1737 2018-09-10 20:17:55 Every time I get an oil change, they find something else wrong with my car. Y’all not getting my money today.

1756 2018-09-10 20:15:40 Trump is the symptom of a much bigger issue: the carbon bubble. Instead of cutting down carbon emissions by transitioning to green energy, the fossil fuel industry backed a man who ran against green energy and appointed gas, oil, and coal moguls to key administrative positions.

1777 2018-09-10 20:13:03 Venezuela wanted change for the better. Chavez promised them a country built around socialism. He won. At first, it worked. The oil industry, and others, were nationalized. And run into the ground. People are starving.
Now, even Pres Maduro admits socialism doesn't work.
1778 2018-09-10 20:13:02 Taxes, custom duties and crude oil is sufficient to develop this country. Half of the developed countries in the world don't have these things. I am tired.
1779 2018-09-10 20:13:00 People pray for cake. Then when God gives them the batter, eggs, oil, icing, a pan and an oven, they get frustrated and leave the kitchen.

How you want God to make a way for you if you’re not trying to help yourself
1780 2018-09-10 20:12:44 Love to hear things like this absolutely brilliant. People just don’t realise how good cbd oil helps people and just listen to doctors prescribing you with tablets constantly what don’t work making the rich more richer
1781 2018-09-10 20:12:42 Damn! That Royal Purple oil just ran me $250+ not including filters & differential fluid. Forgot how much it costs to maintain a Diesel 
1782 2018-09-10 20:12:26 That 9 year years of unemployment dropping from 11 % to 4 was terrible wasn't it 'How about that change in oil dependence  shifting from the Middle East to  us  A real downer, or we can't forget the 260,000 avg job monthly growth ,9 yr Bull market ,what NERVE
1783 2018-09-10 20:12:11 I’m sure there will be more Oil Manias next year also to tied them over.  I’m not surprised. They haven’t really built it up on tv yet except say which legends are on the card that haven’t wrestled in years.
1784 2018-09-10 20:12:06 Auto shops are nothing but BS.
After getting my oil changed this last place said I needed 2-4 things worked on, but I declined at the moment.  I call back now, and ask to be reminded what those things were?  “ your chart says everything’s fine with your car!  All’s good”
1785 2018-09-10 20:11:54 I need an oil change too

1790 2018-09-10 20:11:10 Lol got my oil change two weeks after I said I was going to 
 I’m a professional procrastinator
1791 2018-09-10 20:11:09 So that's why some of the platforms have closed, here was me thinking the oil was all used up !
1792 2018-09-10 20:11:01 More half truths and lies from May, goes to show us once again she is not only anti oil but anti Alberta. Giving us one more reason why she could never be a national leader.

1795 2018-09-10 20:10:35 FYI have just been out to that coast and watched English Bay shipping.  None used pilot ships...  these new tankers would use pilots front and back and be double hulled... about as safe as is possible these days.  For sure safer than trains running oil through Lac Megantics

How much did you owe in Rupees to oil companies when #NDA came to power? 
In case you don't know ask that deaf and dumb robot who happened to be accidental PM that time.

1807 2018-09-10 20:08:07 I think I’ve had some sort of infection deep in my left ear for a couple of days, my mom immediately warmed some olive oil and poured it straight into my ear, now I have to keep my neck turned to my right and it’s killing me

1815 2018-09-10 20:06:56 #Venezuela has agreed to hand over at least seven oil fields to little-known companies that will be paid to boost output through contracts similar to ones rolled back under late socialist leader Hugo Chavez, according to two sources and an internal document.
1816 2018-09-10 20:06:53 Check my pinned tweet babe, castor oil, coconut oil and water are your best friends

1821 2018-09-10 20:06:12 cooking chicken with coconut oil gives it a certain sweetness that I like.... not a sweets person at all tho
1822 2018-09-10 20:06:08 @GordonRamsay Woke up on the kitchen floor last night, dreaming I was smeared in baby oil and being slapped about a sumo ring by a giant pain-au-chocolat. Any advice for someone trying to deal with #KitchenNightmares?
1823 2018-09-10 20:06:08 Need to invest in clean energy? Agreed. How are we going to finance the investment? More/higher taxes? Like getting blood from a stone is it not? I think that, like it or not, getting the oil resource to market is a necessary evil.
1824 2018-09-10 20:05:57 Welcome to lagos
1825 2018-09-10 20:05:45 Thatcher sold out Scotlands oil to private companies she sold everything to private companies that's why we no longer manufacture anything anymore, shipbuilding, steel, car manufacturing, you name it it's all gone oil carried her for decades while she blew it.

1832 2018-09-10 20:04:40 Perhaps some coconut oil would help

1836 2018-09-10 20:04:24 Lemon oil on scabs/scars is amazing.
1837 2018-09-10 20:04:20 Cool, I need to get a special oil and some bombs first, hits me fucking hard though and makes me bleed very quickly! Maybe I do need a level up a bit
1838 2018-09-10 20:04:15 Thanks for reaching out! We have been members of @RSPOtweets since 2015 & work directly with our suppliers to ensure their practices are in line with sourcing best practices. The RSPO is working to strengthen the sustainability practices for the entire palm oil supply chain.
1839 2018-09-10 20:04:02 Tonkotsu my favorite ramen, and there is only one place near me that makes it fantastic.  I always get it spicy though. I think they add chili oil to do that.
1840 2018-09-10 20:03:48 I got so much done today except my oil change . Chabills blew me
1841 2018-09-10 20:03:40 How well has the oil been doing ?
1842 2018-09-10 20:03:38 I’m gonna kill my phone and this domino’s veggie sandwich in the lobby of this auto shop while I get an oil change.
1843 2018-09-10 20:03:28 @JakeGuti I was interested in the Bulletproof Coffee that you mentioned this AM. Do you use the Bulletproof coffee beans or have tried the Bulletproof brain octane oil?
1844 2018-09-10 20:03:22 The gold dial soap & tea tree oil worked for me!
1845 2018-09-10 20:03:18 My car got new brakes , an oil change and the inspection done I just need it cleaned out and now !

1847 2018-09-10 20:03:14 How cum oil is being dirty xx
1848 2018-09-10 20:03:10 I don’t have experience with this, but I’ve heard wonders about tea tree oil and would try that definitely!!!
1849 2018-09-10 20:02:55 What?... What on earth are you talking about? Scottish oil has nothing whatsoever to do with Russian Oligarchs, where are you reading this tripe? 
1850 2018-09-10 20:02:53 Well, we’ve got oil.
For some nations, that’s enough.
1851 2018-09-10 20:02:40 Where do the First Nations get The$Funding for a Mega Billion $ Project like Fort Hills. ? Indigenous Peoples, always protesting Big Oil. Their daily Bread and Circus is given to them by Big Oil. Rachel Notley and Indigenous Peoples , same diaper, different baby.
1852 2018-09-10 20:02:34 I make a version of this using both pears and fresh cranberries. I can’t wait to try using olive oil and the crushed amaretti !  Thank you Mary Ann!
1853 2018-09-10 20:02:31 Wow she and her family are gonna get so much nutritional value from that sunflower oil
1854 2018-09-10 20:02:25 Oil prices were down in 2016.  They're back up and we are seeing more investment.  Nothing to do with Trump.
1855 2018-09-10 20:02:23 Considering an Obama nat sec adviser was a Fiction major, this actually makes sense lol
1856 2018-09-10 20:02:19 Toh zamu chimasa uwa kuwa very soon
1857 2018-09-10 20:02:06 also she follows me on here though, what with all the conservatives investing the country's future in oil and tanking the economy
1858 2018-09-10 20:01:56 The oil and gas sector do not get any subsidies that are not available to any other sector. One could argue under this gov the resource sector is under attack and held to a much higher standard than any other sector In Canada.
1859 2018-09-10 20:01:49 Just use palm oil
So it would be reddish
1860 2018-09-10 20:01:48 Because you shouldn't cook olive oil?
1861 2018-09-10 20:01:48 I need an oil change and tire rotation
1862 2018-09-10 20:01:33 Well their policy of encouraging Saudi over production did for Venezuela’s oil industry, just like it hammered the one here.  That policy was designed to facilitate régime change in there and in Iran.
1863 2018-09-10 20:01:28 This was the factors in 2014 too. What is new. But difference is crude oil price then and now.

“He’s a snake oil salesman, Bob.”

“Congratulations! You’re exactly right! But we don’t actually have your prize money because we used it to get him here.”
1867 2018-09-10 20:01:25 When the fuck did oil changes jump up to $80?????
1868 2018-09-10 20:01:19 We don't and never have had control over our own Oil & gas, why do you think WM is terrified of us controlling our own resources? The mismanagement of Scotlands oil is nothing more than shameful, once independent we'll see the true wealth of Scotland.
1869 2018-09-10 20:01:14 I don't think this is a good thing. Alltrade especially oil is tied to the American dollar. If the US dollar is no longer the main currency used in oil trade did other countries will want to exchange their Holdings in u.s. dollars for other currency.
1870 2018-09-10 20:01:04 Do a match making in Middle East help us out fornite we give you oil it’s so unfair that we have to connect to eu and they enjoy 50 ping less and we enjoy 100 ping
1871 2018-09-10 20:00:56 glamglow’s supermud mask is VERY harsh, but seeing the oil seep out of yr pores is great for morale. overmoisturizing is bad in the short term, but great in the long run. especially if yr breaking out because you damaged the horny layer of yr skin. which tea tree oil will do!

1889 2018-09-10 19:59:10 Venezuela’s oil production continues to erode at a rapid rate. Output fell to just 1.278 million barrels per day in July, down roughly 50,000 bpd from a month earlier and down more than 500,000 bpd since the fourth quarter of 2017.

1892 2018-09-10 19:58:53 @billmaher how does the Gov not taxing the shit out of an Oil Company equate to subsidizing the company? It’s not the Government’s money to start with that they are allowing business to keep. @JimCarrey DM for my account number. Venezuela has how many millionaires compared to 90s
1893 2018-09-10 19:58:44 Or at least the oil money will tide them over until the tv money starts to roll in.

1910 2018-09-10 19:57:23 I'm in the South, some of the jobs that need qualified workers and pay very well are electricians, commercial plumbers, oil rig workers, airplane mechanics, welders. No shame in blue collar work. My Hispanic husband, a commercial electrician and I just bought a second house.
1911 2018-09-10 19:57:22 Maduro’s cryptocurrency, supposedly backed by Venezuela’s oil reserves, is a very hollow promise. To be sure, few analysts expected much from the “petro,” Maduro’s hastily launched cryptocurrency. One petro was supposed to be backed by one barrel of oil,
1912 2018-09-10 19:57:15 Just watched @elonmusk podcast with @joerogan show, and subconsciously your part about manhattan and horses is a metaphor for your cars and current market fluctuation in oil commodities, only you’re not dragging the auto sector but trying to revive it with electric alternatives.
1913 2018-09-10 19:57:09 We’ve gotta stop equating the decline in #BigOil investment with a decline in International Capital Investment in Canada. Oil is the problem sector because:
1)Oil price volatility,
2) shale oil competition, and
3) #ClimateChange
make #FossilFuels a bad investment.

1916 2018-09-10 19:56:55 @StarbucksCanada Has the recipe for your Oat Bars been changed recently?  It tastes as if there is too much oil/liquid in the recipe and the bar feels greasy when I pick it up.  I like my daily Oat Bar but have stopped ordering because of the change in texture.  Thank you.
1917 2018-09-10 19:56:55 A guy told me today that I had really good form and that I’m gonna do very well on most oil patterns and then my wrist started fucking up and I was bowling really well #bowling prob
1918 2018-09-10 19:56:41 Is there any chance to "ambani" for another oil reserve..?

1920 2018-09-10 19:56:36 $Oil The "petro" (Venezuela) is supposed to be backed by 5 billion barrels of oil located in Atapirire, a small town in Venezuela’s remote savanna in the middle of the country. Reserves in this region are the lynchpin of the petro.

1926 2018-09-10 19:56:14 Won’t be playing HQ tonight I guess. Peddling snake oil to sick, desperate, and/or gullible people to make a quick buck is unconscionable. This will make me debate deleting the app.

1928 2018-09-10 19:55:51 @CharlieDemelo @itvcorrie #Corrie How is your beard so shiny? Is that beard oil or lots of glitter? 
1929 2018-09-10 19:55:44 Yes
1930 2018-09-10 19:55:43 No liquid needed. I even do small new potatoes with some oil and the work brilliantly
1931 2018-09-10 19:55:34 There were very small welts yesterday, which I immediately treated with saint john's wort oil, which is for burns. Today, there is nothing on my skin, but I can still feel it in my fingers. the pain isn't distracting, tho! it's easy to take my mind off of
1932 2018-09-10 19:55:33 I corrected the guy in the best manner about his misleading tweets yesterday,yet he continued
1933 2018-09-10 19:55:22 My God Scottie, not only are you clueless about the SNHS but now you've no idea who squandered our £billions since 1969? Do you remember BP when it was British? What do you think was bankrolling Thatcher & Blair for years? Scotland has never been in control of our oil.
1934 2018-09-10 19:55:21 If the oil is there, profit will be made, no doubt about that!
1935 2018-09-10 19:55:19 Wonder how oil companies in CA feel about that?
1936 2018-09-10 19:55:15 Don’t worry #Venezuela ! #America is here! To overthrow your government and steal your natural ressources! We are in Somalia, Syria, arm Saudi for one reason #OIL
1937 2018-09-10 19:55:04 Is God's will really murder flooding the streets?
Can we measure her love by the oil underneath?
All I ever wanted was what I was told I was owed
At what cost? I'll never know
1938 2018-09-10 19:55:03 It's not really a paradox. Gulf Coast and Midwest have economies of scale that we just can't match.

They can extract more value out of a barrel of oil than we can in Alberta
1939 2018-09-10 19:54:59 This year 3 for Goff I'm not buying the snake oil yet lol over reaction Monday
1940 2018-09-10 19:54:53 Religion has nothing to do with it... money, greed, oil, weapon sales, cause of all wars
1941 2018-09-10 19:54:46 Hes already got one from his lucrative olive oil business
1942 2018-09-10 19:54:45 I wanna make my own oil blend how do I do this not expensively lol
1943 2018-09-10 19:54:41 Pulled up to blacks to get my oil changed... they asked me if I was gonna get my inspection done, I said no why? They said “well it expired last month if you didn’t notice”... whoops yeah let’s get it inspected 
1944 2018-09-10 19:54:38 What are they going to do with all there Oil wells and Gas wells in Cali? Abandon them?  There has to be thousands of wells still pumping.
1945 2018-09-10 19:54:33 After using coconut oil & Tumerick powder for so long I will never use whitening strips again.
1946 2018-09-10 19:54:29 I have different forms! I have an oil that i take a few drops of in the am but also have patches that I use when I can’t sleep!
1947 2018-09-10 19:54:24 Omg I’ve been wanting to try this. Did you add the oil to your tea?
1948 2018-09-10 19:54:22 Perhaps because everyone else’s food (eg French Brie, Welsh lamb, Belgian chocolate, Danish bacon & Scotch whisky) goes through Rotterdam? Netherlands is also a *huge* oil exporter, not bad without any oil fields
1949 2018-09-10 19:54:20 On an onion bagel with healthy schmear of cream cheese - yeah!

1951 2018-09-10 19:54:15 Amir, how will this effect America? Ive always heard that overseas countries buying and selling oil in usa dollars is the only thing that keeps our dollar from collapse.
1952 2018-09-10 19:53:52 Tsiganska banica (Циганска баница) - slice of bread, sprinkled with smoked paprika and salt and a dash of sunflower oil on top. How more Slav can a snack be?
1953 2018-09-10 19:53:50 So 56 > 76 according to you because facts are presented through bar graph, what type of math this is . And how it is right even in % economically?  The 2008 depression is known to all & it's affects on Indian economy, also the factor of crude oil prices in int'l market. OH GOD 
1954 2018-09-10 19:53:46 & OIL?

Aqua then rubbed her belly, [+]
1958 2018-09-10 19:53:14 I had a part time weekend work while in campus. I delivered hair grow oil to customers all over Nairobi. I was paid 2k per week.. depending on  how much you deliver
1959 2018-09-10 19:53:12 Aww! Need more baby oil and powder! That and a mama to get your bottom all cleaned up :3
1960 2018-09-10 19:53:10 ...right! Saudi oil
1961 2018-09-10 19:53:10 We've neither had the benefit of proportionately huge gas and oil reserves nor bankers whose policies were honed by accepting the gold the Nazis stole.
1962 2018-09-10 19:53:07 Cut into some Kiev’s and the hot butter / oil went all over my leg .. Never been so gutted .. love mopping the stuff up with chips
1963 2018-09-10 19:53:02 Innocent civilians? Are you really talking about innocent civilians?
Dude you are a murderer. You killed civilians for #oil .
1964 2018-09-10 19:52:59 ...it was sold to big oil and gas companies
1965 2018-09-10 19:52:41 1) 1976, the world oil shock cause inflation to rise globally - OPEC oil crisis 

2) You use monetary policy to control inflation and Multiplier has not cause Osborne rampant inflation because we no longer live in a labour-intensive economy - automation.
1966 2018-09-10 19:52:36 thank u lovely! i’ve never bought coconut oil before - i wasn’t sure what adding more oil to my skin would do to it but i might try it 
1967 2018-09-10 19:52:31 Needed an oil change in the middle of a road trip last week. They were politely adamant that, without my name/address, they could not service me. "I don't live here, won't be back, paying cash" "But we have to put you in the NATIONAL data base" which was my objection up front.
1968 2018-09-10 19:52:22 Now try getting one without palm oil! We make our own or get it from living naturally, theirs is very good
1969 2018-09-10 19:52:18 No, thank goodness @GovInslee voted NO on the Oil Terminals here locally! But we finally found a candidate to oust our MIA (R) US Rep Herrera Beutler in @ElectLong (Carolyn Long). She's gonna be a GREAT Rep for our District.
1970 2018-09-10 19:52:18 No, then who authorized the oil companies to extract the oil ?
1971 2018-09-10 19:52:09 Oh my goodness! How great is the smell of clove oil? Mmmmmmm!
1972 2018-09-10 19:52:07 In #Nicaragua, for example, the dictator uses money from loans from banks and venezuela from oil to buy weapons and murder his people who want justice and democracy
1973 2018-09-10 19:52:02 Лол я не один такой дебил, путаю рандомным персонажей. Я когда читала Милу Рудик, путала Гарика и Нила. Поняла это только когда была на середине четвёртой книги.

Когда это два абсолютно разных парня.
Разного возраста.
И характера.
Но я их путала, ибо одинаково представляла.
Збс.
1974 2018-09-10 19:51:42 Tesla was extremely successful at creating power from the natural environment, which pissed-off the oil companies so badly, that much off his work is still classified by the US government
1975 2018-09-10 19:51:41 Can this Country NIGERIA be nice again, Can we ever witness oil Boom again, is it not better we try something else
1976 2018-09-10 19:51:39 Genie Energy picked Trump’s transition team, Genie Energy (Israel’s Afek Energy) stuck oil in the occupied Syrian Golan Heights, Israel wants the US to recognize their illegal annexation so the land & resource (water) theft can continue
1977 2018-09-10 19:51:32 The UN prostitutes itself to the owners of the dollar who control the finance of the oil via corrupt CEOs and boards of directors of Western oil companies. Don't try to blame all Arabs for how their Muslim brotherhood governments and occidental CEOs/shareholders operate.
1978 2018-09-10 19:51:29 Nearly every former EPA Administrator went on to work for oil, gas, or chemical companies.
1979 2018-09-10 19:51:29 There are a lot of places that need supplies, but no loads out.  Alaska, for example.  One way haul in, but no return loads out.  Mines, oil wells.  This makes shipping expensive for supplies to remote areas.  Truckers want both ways to make money on both routes.  This solves it.
1980 2018-09-10 19:51:20 I do not understand oil economics one bit.
1981 2018-09-10 19:51:12 Do you have tea tree oil?!
1982 2018-09-10 19:51:07 In other breaking news, good old #KevinHassett was last seen under a bus leaving the White House. The well oiled machine is leaking oil!

1985 2018-09-10 19:51:02 The army might cause the fire on purpose .so in order to avoid nomads come close to oil field for grazing
1986 2018-09-10 19:50:47 This man is snake oil salesman with a history of treating women inappropriately, a woman recently accused him of groping her and he dismissed her claims as a misunderstanding. He's a self-absorbed disingenuous liar. Don't be fooled by his smarmy BS.
1987 2018-09-10 19:50:42 Hope you also research the raw oil cost at that time and now...
1988 2018-09-10 19:50:41 No, because Scotland isn't self-ruled in UK. UK is responsible for creating the deficits, not Scotland alone. Can we have our oil revenues back and the investment income from the oil fund that UK Gov failed to establish in the 1970s which would've created an income for eternity?
1989 2018-09-10 19:50:33 Because they have to live and work along side us that's why.  They have no solution at all for Northern Ireland boarder for example, and they should have.  They should be balls out, burning the midnight oil to resolve that one for us, not the other way around.

1993 2018-09-10 19:50:02 In your honest spiritual and professional opinion, do you think this woman would benefit from a good old fashioned exorcism? I'd at least like to throw some anointing oil and holy water in her face. Maybe that would cool her off.
1994 2018-09-10 19:49:59 F this drunk driver
1995 2018-09-10 19:49:48 maybe try a wee bit of coconut oil to soothe ur skin if the acne cream is hurting u !! (Don’t be afraid of using oil even tho u (likely?) have oily skin - the coconut oil will prevent ur skin from producing the bad oils)  skin probs r the worst, sending u luv
1996 2018-09-10 19:49:44 I made it but it has too much sugar. Have you ever had a recipe that says to use an ingredient but it doesn't list how much? Missing amount was oil for the cake so i used 1/2c.
1997 2018-09-10 19:49:26 I learned how to reset the service interval indicator on my brother's car. Considerably more complicated than changing the oil and filter, it turns out...

2001 2018-09-10 19:49:03 Cut every tree in your sight. Pump last drop of crude oil and you get GDP of the roof. 
GDP is an ill way to measure society in full. 
GDP measures income, not equality.
GDP stands for growth, not destruction that comes with it.
GDP fully ignores social cohesion and environment.
2002 2018-09-10 19:48:59 Dada if you have done some research about increase in price of petrol rather than posting pro trinomool photos! Then you wouldn't have said it. Reason one 1. Trade war between us and china. Reason 2 payment of loans on crude oil import which was due for a long period of time.
2003 2018-09-10 19:48:39 See how truth is displayed and played. See the purchasing cost. 

Mar 2014:
Petrol Price:Rs 70
Intn'l Crude Oil: $107
Central Excise Duty: 3.92

Sep 2018:
Petrol Price:Rs 81
Intn'l Crude Oil:$76

2005 2018-09-10 19:48:33 Trade futures and commodities on the CMS 24/6. It's way cooler now to buy oil, corn, and gold than it is to buy Google or Amazon.
2006 2018-09-10 19:48:29 You get your oil changed yet bih
2007 2018-09-10 19:48:15 I was sure he was like this since even before his election when he said he would cut the electric cars rebate so he can literally use taxpayers money to give it to oil corps so the fuel price goes down.
2008 2018-09-10 19:48:07 There's more oil in the ground in Southern England than what's left in the North Sea! Like North Sea oil, is it currently viable to extract
2009 2018-09-10 19:48:07 Have u tried essential oil infused weed? I have something that'll help with ur stress
2010 2018-09-10 19:48:03 Oil and vinegar don’t mix. She just wants a steady day shift for her family. Can’t blame her but really, The View?? You can’t be yourself. It shows from the reports from others. The View! You don’t belong there of all places!
2011 2018-09-10 19:47:58 How can we defend human rights by buying Saudi oil is the question?
2012 2018-09-10 19:47:34 @SenFeinstein Nice picture of the bridge,  think Trump would tare it down if oil was found around it?
2013 2018-09-10 19:47:21 tea tree oil!!
2014 2018-09-10 19:46:57 My story is in my pinned tweet. We're being lied to about how it happened, like almost every war we've ever been involved in. Psychologists are explaining why we refuse to accept that our government was in on it: to break up the Middle East. For oil (and Christianity).

2018 2018-09-10 19:46:25 Much like oil then. Far less global damage than has been caused by oil extraction and transport.

2020 2018-09-10 19:46:18 Assuming this comes from the same place as de-stinking derby gear (and one can tolerate EOs), I make a water/tea tree/peppermint oil spray that helps keep the bacteria at bay. Some skaters use a vodka/alcohol base, but I find that it evaporates _too_ quickly.

2041 2018-09-10 19:43:09 “Something is very wrong when citizens of an oil rich country have to leave in order to beg on Colombian streets to feed their children.  That something is the corruption of the Maduro regime. This is a man-made crisis.  Period.”
2042 2018-09-10 19:43:06 Turning to the voice, the young mother smiled. Those mystic eyes gazing up at him, she nodded and said to him.

❝Yes, yes it is. It's a nice change of pace from the weather I seen on my travels.❞

Aqua spoke softly, up and down her thighs that oil went. Making her skin [+]
2043 2018-09-10 19:43:05 Did I say coconut oil? I meant crystal meth
2044 2018-09-10 19:42:37 hurricanes are a conspiracy by big oil
2045 2018-09-10 19:42:31 Saw there's a @GCAS2018 panel to discuss "Can limiting oil production make good climate policy?"... I thought we were past these types of discussions.

2046 2018-09-10 19:42:29 Obviously it's a bad "essentials" list in the sense that it's not oil. garlic, onion, etc, but it's a great "essentials" list in that it makes it so you can stop things from being the same bland ass meal every night.

Comments are atrocious too, as ever.
2047 2018-09-10 19:42:25 Who decides which companies will be taken over by the state? It usually starts with the oil companies, yes? Who’s next?? When do they get to MGM or Universal or HBO...? Is that what you want @billmaher
2048 2018-09-10 19:42:16 Omo we dey vex fr lag
2049 2018-09-10 19:42:12 as long as they don’t have access to ingesting the actual oil it will be fine! i used one in my room and my cat would sniff right where the steam comes out and she was fine
2050 2018-09-10 19:42:08 Venezuela has the largest deposits of oil in the world. Yet the people starve. Even Maduro has said socialism hasn't worked. But he isn't starving. And he is trying to find new ways to steal.
2051 2018-09-10 19:41:57 Forget Alberta, fuck the oil. Ford’s shit show with his ongoing pissing contests is where the action is. Gonna start listening to political tv show talking heads and read the pundits/columnists/opinion writers. Concert time is here. 
2052 2018-09-10 19:41:50 An example would be :Not paying for the ‘trash ‘ oil companies dump into athmosphere ! Our air and atmosphere is NOT their garbage bin!!! As everyone pays for dumping the garbage, so should they pay or stop dumping it, capisci?
2053 2018-09-10 19:41:32 Well except in Canada where pipelines and Tar Sands oil continue to be the most destructive fossil fuel operation on the planet, and BC’s #1 export is coal #HeartofDarkness

2055 2018-09-10 19:40:58 Just give her some Castor oil.  Works like a charm.  Don't forget the arsenic.  Uh oh is that gonna get me in Twitter trouble?
2056 2018-09-10 19:40:46 Will olive oil get it off?
2057 2018-09-10 19:40:42 I want to say snake oil but that is totally different level of bullshit.
2058 2018-09-10 19:40:40 Look at the weather map! You deny this is result of global warming! Your denial of scientific facts is nothing but a lie to please @PutinRF_Eng and Big Oil!
2059 2018-09-10 19:40:35 “Animals need to be in the wild” where is this wild? Is it in the palm oil grove? Is it in the suburb?

2064 2018-09-10 19:40:12 'I co own an olive oil company' is this the measure of success now?

2070 2018-09-10 19:39:32 I watched as the last of my oil poured into my lantern. It was meant to last a long winter, but in this cursed place, I had already depleted my supply.  Heaving am annoyed sigh, I leaned back, eyes tracing the crystallized cave walls.#WrittenRiver Prompt 1513

Pls we should stop giving wrong msgs. Saudis killing hundreds of muslims everyday in Yemen &Syria by giving aid to ISIS
2078 2018-09-10 19:38:39 No just stock up on food, batteries, and lard to use for oil and candles.
2079 2018-09-10 19:38:32 U.S. Exxon Mobil, France’s Total & Hellenic Petroleum has been awarded a tender to explore for oil and gas off Greece. Exxon and Total each have 40 percent. Licences must be ratified by parliament before exploration work can begin. Exxon/Total are currently exploring off Cyprus
2080 2018-09-10 19:38:30 And.. because California has shut down oil drilling, they now have to import their oil into the state because gasoline is not going away any time soon.

2087 2018-09-10 19:38:04 Japan also has a 99% conviction rate.

I always wonder how many of those suicides aren't suicides but written off as suicides because there's no good leads and would hurt the conviction rate.
2088 2018-09-10 19:37:26 We encourage you do get back with the rest of the world and instead of pandering to big oil actually do something to help curb these mega storms.

But, we all know you won't. Yet another reason you will be GONE in 2020.

2090 2018-09-10 19:37:23 Stole your oil?
No one stole your oil, you pissed it up the wall. 

I bet you're in Glasgow, further from the oil than England.
2091 2018-09-10 19:37:20 With @interior’s latest rule on methane waste rule due any day now, we have the materials to keep you informed on everything you need to know about the needless loss of natural gas during oil and gas production on federal lands and the billions of $$$ in taxpayer losses.

2096 2018-09-10 19:36:46 Yeah don’t let your criminal activity distract you from selling snake oil to your faithful.
2097 2018-09-10 19:36:40 The business climate in Alberta is the worst, maybe except for Vz today. There has been no Canadian champion to take any responsibility for industry. Politicians happy to see oil go away, but didn’t know where their tax revenues will come from, so invent a carbon tax?Comedic.

2104 2018-09-10 19:35:37 The true sign of a con man. That's why old fashioned snake oil salesmen were so successful. Lie to the populace and those dumb fuckers would buy anything. Same thing holds true in uneducated America.
2105 2018-09-10 19:35:34 The only way to guarantee anything is via AdWords. Beyond that, tell them if anybody is selling them guaranteed organic search then it’s either short term and will hurt them long term or it’s a snake oil salesman.

2107 2018-09-10 19:35:31 RT @mantalicious: I’m not convinced. Bloomberg article yesterday quoted industry saying they expect oil demand will peak with a decade & major energy spending will decline. Divestment into cheaper cleaner renewables is driving it.  #bcpoli #abpoli #cdnpoli

2114 2018-09-10 19:34:43 I'm mad I just found out about Bio Oil. 
My face has been breaking out the worst lately, put it on my face and woke up to a 80% turn around.  
WHAT. 
2115 2018-09-10 19:34:43 Plus olive oil. Where do I sign up? Oh, wait, I can't, because I should be in the kitchen. You know, it's a rare man who makes me want to leave my kitchen, but this guy's got the skills.
2116 2018-09-10 19:34:42  Im sorry to hear that sis! Green tea, Tumeric, Ginger, ACV and Cinnamon all help with inflammation which causes joint issues. Exercise your legs a lil to help blood circulation, stretch daily, add tea tree, frankincense to the oil you use and massage your legs before bed.
2117 2018-09-10 19:34:34 Lol you are a tube. When is England going to repay Scotland for oil theft? No savings achieved despite other countries managing to make savings. The U.K. is morally and financially bankrupt.

2120 2018-09-10 19:34:29 When Obama was president, he put so mant regulations on oil & coal that it put many companies out of business. At the time I lived in WY.

Take out the oil, and the fact that by some stroke of luck, they've been able to manage it, they are just another Africa backward society, in ideology

2144 2018-09-10 19:31:44 Record gas prices: 
2008 was also the year gasoline hit its highest one-day price ever -- $4.11 per gallon in July. At the time, a red-hot global economy and fears over dwindling supplies were some of the factors that sent both gas and oil prices to their highest level ever.
2145 2018-09-10 19:31:31 It's less about global warming and more about the Iranian invasion of Saudi Arabia that is coming.  

California imports more oil and gas than the other 49 states combined.
2146 2018-09-10 19:31:28 My dog used to do that especially when he found oil near the road or a car park
2147 2018-09-10 19:31:23 so what you are saying is 2 lakh crore oil bond story is fake that's been circulated by BJP??

2150 2018-09-10 19:31:11 So an opinion piece direct from the oil industry is your definition of "unbiased"?
2151 2018-09-10 19:31:11 I'll explain to you when you stop insulting yan kano,but for now go and read about pilling,precast,piers,raft foundation ,post tensioning and pretension, u can grab Theory of structures, Chanakya,highway engrn by Reynold etc.
2152 2018-09-10 19:31:07 How about the $13 billion Canada pays for foreign oil every year - $$ LEAVING our economy to support countries with pathetic human rights and enviro policies. Does that somehow make sense?

2154 2018-09-10 19:31:02 Yeah, oil is an outdated, expensive and heavily subsidized way of creating electricity while polluting the environment! If real cost of oil will be taken into account, oil and other fossils are the most expensive and dirtiest forms of energy!

2164 2018-09-10 19:29:31 Instead of asking "are you allergic" you should probably ask "is it okay if it's cooked in the same oil as gluten products?" Sounds less judge-y and sone folk that are only slightly allergic might be fine with it
2165 2018-09-10 19:29:28 I’m not convinced. Bloomberg article yesterday quoted industry saying they expect oil demand will peak with a decade & major energy spending will decline. Divestment into cheaper cleaner renewables is driving it

2171 2018-09-10 19:28:39 I blame me too - I assume there is some form of earworm. Midnight oil?
2172 2018-09-10 19:28:31 It’s The Oil Money!
2173 2018-09-10 19:28:25 Hey all, been burning the midnight oil trying to get Monster Scanner finished.  Hopefully we have a release in a few days!
2174 2018-09-10 19:28:24 Cut in half, brush w/ coconut oil + spices, skewer, grill.

Or throw them in the trash.
2175 2018-09-10 19:28:20 extra virgin olive oil
olive oil who experimented a little in college
olive oil thats been born again
2176 2018-09-10 19:28:19 Wow! Forgot about the notwithstanding clause! So comforting to know that our courts can't run wild in this country, overriding the will of the people's legislatures! Now if only our selfie-obsessed Boy King can have the cojones to do the same in regards to the oil pipeline mess.
2177 2018-09-10 19:28:16 .@TimmyHillRacer says there is still oil in turn 3
2178 2018-09-10 19:27:59 Tea tree oil will dry out both your acne and if you have trauma bumps on your piercings

2181 2018-09-10 19:27:20 I swear it’s only females that work at the oil change place by my house I think that’s so cool 
2182 2018-09-10 19:27:14 Congrats bro!
2183 2018-09-10 19:27:10 10 crore vehicle users, Rs 300 extra per month expenditure per user, will make Rs 3000 crore extra earning for oil Companies per month
2184 2018-09-10 19:26:58 Pakistan State Oil Co. and Qatargas officials didn’t respond to requests for comment. Gunvor and BP declined to comment. Shell said it looks forward to future LNG options in Pakistan, without directly commenting on the tender.

What transparency, none of the bidder responded 
2185 2018-09-10 19:26:58 Coconut oil. 
Melt 2 tsps (Bain-Marie style), rub in to hair, wrap head in shower cap, leave on 2 hours then wash off with coconut oil shampoo, no conditioner, dry naturally. Repeat at least monthly. Wash hair twice a week.
Now in my 60s my plait reaches my legs 
2186 2018-09-10 19:26:34 It’s trying to say that the previous govt under MMS had made an international oil bond debt of 2lkh crores that the current government has already paid.. hoping u enjoy debt free rides..long ones
2187 2018-09-10 19:26:30 Blind Bhakt or well educated journalist? You missed crude oil price in your calculations
2188 2018-09-10 19:26:26 My skin hated coconut oil. I such at taking vitamins consistently, jojoba oil is boss!!
2189 2018-09-10 19:26:13 How many more times do you need to SHOUT this so our DEAF government, media, tv, radio, snake oil salesmen, LISTEN!
The end game is looming and all are deaf.
I for one appreciate your efforts, keep SHOUTING!
2190 2018-09-10 19:26:00 Not patience, but they dwell on Freebies which @MBuhari has stopped. Like I used to Say, No Importer of Rice, Gari, Toothpicks, Palm Oil, Tomatoes, Junks etc will ever support Buhari. Only the Masses love @MBuhari and @ProfOsinbajo
2191 2018-09-10 19:25:54 You are giving figure of crude oil prices etc. Why don't you give figure(₹) which India today lost because of #BharatBandh  Shame on you guys.
2192 2018-09-10 19:25:51 Want a clear conscience while tucking into your @Nestle @PepsiCo & @KFC? Then first tell palm oil regulator @RSPOtweets to suspend disgraced #palmoil company @Indofood

2194 2018-09-10 19:25:48 Hey everyone join me on Sunday Sept 16th at the Women's Gathering event Muslim Community Center of Portland I will be tabling there with all my essential oil and holistic product line. Hope to see you all there.
2195 2018-09-10 19:25:43 My sauce recipe is "from a jar, but put olive oil, garlic, and pepper flakes in the sauce pan first."

Even if it has those IN the jar sauce, it's never enough.
2196 2018-09-10 19:25:40 Even this graph is incomplete until it shows givt subsidy per litre ... plus per litre burden for the payment of oil bond from UPA legacy 
2197 2018-09-10 19:25:36 I believe your tweets went something like "wtf Quebec" then everyone laughed at you. Ya, and that court system is exactly what I told you would happen. IF you knew oil in Quebec, this has been going on since 2002. "The king" LOL. Don't lie Joe Fraud.
2198 2018-09-10 19:25:36 ...the inability to end oil & gas subsidies 

OBAMA choosing to continue backing fossil fuels instead aggressively pivoting to RENEWABLES

OBAMA waiting until end of his term to "halt" Keystone Pipeline

OBAMA APPROVING drilling in the Arctic. It was Shell who backed down...
2199 2018-09-10 19:25:35 #ADRattray Cask Islay T: Oily palate but not too heavy, malty, a beer or Stout float with vanilla ice-cream, wintergreen oil, oily peat smoke, tar, Coal-tar soap, treacle toffee, I feel like I need a glass of Swarfega to clear my palate after this dram only I don't want to!
2200 2018-09-10 19:25:34 Turkey is being ruined by Erdogan, but Erdogan and his family reap a fortune from oil and gas transit fees.
2201 2018-09-10 19:25:29 Looks like the uncanny valley met with digital oil painting and laid an egg.
2202 2018-09-10 19:25:21 olive oil can supposedly help relieve that
2203 2018-09-10 19:25:18 A 911 caller is convinced someone has stolen his bottle of olive oil. #Springfieldpolicelog
2204 2018-09-10 19:25:08 "The squeaky wheel gets the most oil," is an observation, not a goal of just government.
2205 2018-09-10 19:25:04 What about crude oil price?
2206 2018-09-10 19:25:02 Dada, oil bond/iran bill/inflation...
2207 2018-09-10 19:24:59 Someone ran me off the road. 
The alternator was fucked because at some point while I’ve been driving the dipstick popped out and oil flew all over the place and contaminated my alternator. 
I’m bad luck
2208 2018-09-10 19:24:38 Of course it only focuses on oil and gas companies like they are the only companies of consequence.  The reason why oil and gas won’t see the likes of those companies is because we are reaching peak oil. We can build other companies-but you’d rather not.  #neverkenney #ableg
2209 2018-09-10 19:24:20 @FreemanToyota  Does Freeman not wash & vac cars in for oil change & tire rotation like other dealers?
2210 2018-09-10 19:24:18 Want truly sustainable #palmoil in your snacks? Tell “sustainable” palm oil certifier to DROP palm oil company @Indofood > @Nestle & @PepsiCo’s business partner abuses workers & destroys #orangutan habitat
2211 2018-09-10 19:24:12 @DrouinJenna Shared this: Life: Balance a checkbook. Sew on a button. Change a tire. Change your oil. Grow food. Do your taxes. Basic first aid. Write a budget. Count change back. Make a meal plan. Be Positive!
2212 2018-09-10 19:24:11 Nope. They knew he was a lying snake oil salesman 18 months ago.
2213 2018-09-10 19:23:50 Thanks. I got Myles Garrett on a new pre-game meal: rusty nails washed down with motor oil. Think it worked. #ComeGetSome

2215 2018-09-10 19:23:39 Anything related to Ferngully, our culture's predominant Tim Curry as oil monster artifact.
2216 2018-09-10 19:23:39 yes but which oil is it CBD or TMX ? because the previous will cause munchies and the latter will pay for them .
2217 2018-09-10 19:23:34 It “exploded” because the US was emerging from a quasi recession in 2014-2016 caused by oversupply and subsequent crashing of oil prices. The explosion was the emergence from that economic shock. You’ll notice in those cherry picked charts spending rebounded long before tax cuts.
2218 2018-09-10 19:23:26 Hello sir apko 2013ke oil ki rs yad he ya bhul gye des Ko 70 year se dubokar  ajj meh se bol rhe  he sarm nhi ati free kakhane ki harmi cangresh cast

2221 2018-09-10 19:23:12 And we thought you were protesting against the oil prices? How cheap can you go Bhushan.
2222 2018-09-10 19:23:05 please get oil to jamie dornan  beard need to get trimmed james please not toomuch ;'(
2223 2018-09-10 19:23:02 Lying in bed, listening to the Doors. I really should oil the hinges...
2224 2018-09-10 19:23:01 Hassett used 2015 as his base year for his cropped chart...as you will recall there was a precipitous drop in oil prices that sent shock to world economic systems. He cherry picked a time span that reflected that reality.
2225 2018-09-10 19:22:55 My momma really jacked me out my coconut oil and she hid it good too. 
2226 2018-09-10 19:22:53 Which olive oil company do you co-own??
2227 2018-09-10 19:22:41 What’s the best CBD oil to get ? I’ve been using Holland & Barrettes but the lids leak 

Suggestions please  TIA 
2228 2018-09-10 19:22:31 It seems that all #tesla FUD spreaders like yourself are hiding behind fake accounts and alias names!! And another thing you have in common : you’re all oil/drunken and greedy, willing to do just about anything for a few extra dirty bucks!!
2229 2018-09-10 19:22:12 If Obama lived in the middle 1800’s he would be great on the back of a wagon selling snake oil. Michelle my belle could dance to draw crowds.
That narcissist is pitiful, bless his heart.
2230 2018-09-10 19:22:04 That BLF leader with untidy hairstyle? He looks like a cat that fell in a drum of used oil
2231 2018-09-10 19:21:59 Dump soybean oil and some white lightning in the middle of a deep dish pizza, then light it up.
2232 2018-09-10 19:21:47 Try it raw, with parmesan cheese shavings, olive oil, lemon juice and salt & pepper.
2233 2018-09-10 19:21:39 The onus is on the apologists, I put forward the proposition that its corrupt - given how crude oil prices have nearly halved.
That's my part.
You do your part, bring out the math
2234 2018-09-10 19:21:38 thanks to CBD oil I'm gonna have no money but god damn I'll be chill as hell about it
2235 2018-09-10 19:21:36 Math konsi class tak padi hai ?? Sach sach bataiyo bhai? Percentage of hike ka matlab ni aata samjh? 2004 se 2014 tak jo oil me hike hui thi uski hike percentage 2014 se 2018 me Comparatively kam hai. Iska ye matlab h @BJP4India
2236 2018-09-10 19:21:35 So does this mean a wind farm off the Santa Barbara? Those oil rigs are an eyesore.
2237 2018-09-10 19:21:33 But you continue to support climate engineering which isn't helping Earth at all or at least the climate. You also continue to support the oil industry (or should I just say fossil fuels). Maybe if you were to support banning it and then maybe things can be better
2238 2018-09-10 19:21:31 you don't need mayonnaise for elotes so it just depends on how much cheese you use, and i suppose u could sub in olive oil for butter in the latter... but aside from that, lemon/lime juice and pepper/chili/cilantro isn't unhealthy.
2239 2018-09-10 19:21:26 More oil to your wisdom jar @ThaLordSleeK

2251 2018-09-10 19:19:28 Euros for oil is what got Sadam Hussein overthrown and killed...but we don't meddle, right? We own Sunni Saudis so no problem there, but I think Iran/Putin are getting a little scary! covfefe
2252 2018-09-10 19:19:24 Nigerian's we're the architects of our misfortune, how can you hike up price from 150# to 700# are u mad,after we'll be blaming leaders
2253 2018-09-10 19:19:13 The view touted by some Turkana County politicians that refining oil at base, much preferable as it is, will enable women hawk petrol in jerricans is a gross misrepresentation of what that development means to the local people. Let nobody exploit ignorance of their people.

2261 2018-09-10 19:18:34 BJP please show the yearly crude oil price per barrel .
2262 2018-09-10 19:18:28 The problem is it’s not simple math. The US had an industrial recession 2014-2016 caused by oversupply, and subsequent crash of oil prices. Late 2016 we were recovering from that economic shock and those investment numbers would have gone up regardless....

2270 2018-09-10 19:17:33 Welll done woth the stats, but could you also care to explain the price of crude oil in UPA govt vs BJP govt. Stop spreading agenda of a single a party and donsome real journalism. If you like a single party so much, please join them officially like your bos Subash Chandra.
2271 2018-09-10 19:17:27 I never remember any president who almost daily harps on the economy, I don't give a shit really, because all I know is food, gas and home heating oil costs more than 18 months ago.What does he have to say about that?

2273 2018-09-10 19:17:03 Mohsin Aziz like most friends of @ImranKhanPTI are experts in deception & misguiding people. @business report on LNG clearly states that most oil & gas contracts between governments are kept confidential. But the motivation of IK like trump is to wipeout legacy of his predecessor
2274 2018-09-10 19:17:00 @dyamondbernardd car keeps beeping for its oil to get changed. She screams “UGH STOP IM GETTING YOU OIL RIGHT NOW! STOP NAGGING!!”
2275 2018-09-10 19:16:53 Definitely OF fish. But also good on fish. (Or on anything. I maybe drank the last of the vinegar/oil/fish sauce in my bowl.)
2276 2018-09-10 19:16:41 Admittedly, I was a tad harsh in my description of NZ' s emissions growth. Though, NZ's oil consumption growth--while not registering on a global scale--is growing strongly, and very much in the wrong direction. Bottom line: #Auckland transportation must get solved.
2277 2018-09-10 19:16:40 Paulie did the prep work. He was doing a year for contempt, and he had this wonderful system for doing the garlic. He used a razor, and he used to slice it so thin that it used to liquefy in the pan with just a little oil. It was a very good system.
2278 2018-09-10 19:16:40 If Doug Ford can use the notwithstanding clause to kick Toronto city councillors in the nuts,surely Alberta has a constitutional right to export our oil and use the notwithstanding clause to build it.
2279 2018-09-10 19:16:32 I sitting in the library reading about the scientific and political history of oil when all of a sudden I got smacked with an anxious energy...

The screams and swearing are simultaneously both disconcerting and very funny. They now want olive oil (google) to make it better #ouch
2282 2018-09-10 19:16:22 Wait! You asked if she had a gun pointed at her? If someone pointed a gun at you, would you take the time to go to the fryer and get hot oil to throw on them? 3 times!? I’m pretty sure there was no gun involved.

2284 2018-09-10 19:15:58 So the biggest fight in the middle east is who controls the oil/gas industry and pipelines - is that fair to say?
2285 2018-09-10 19:15:55 Extactly - they are just like us. Except that independent studies show they have better income, less unemployment, happier people, less debt, and a huge income from oil; and we don't.
It's not PR, it's fact - why do you refuse reality? Westminster wasted the oil, that's a fact.
2286 2018-09-10 19:15:40 lmao i save old cartridges just to use the extra bit of oil left when i run out
2287 2018-09-10 19:15:29 I think it maybe the wild hair growth oil
2288 2018-09-10 19:15:27 Why? Why do you not want equality? You're actually ridiculous mate and I've never even heard of your olive oil company, have you @BethTierney_ ?
2289 2018-09-10 19:15:19 It's false forward Sir. I live in Abu Dhabi & in oil producing country the price of petrol is around 2.5 - 2.8 AED around 48-55 RS.& in India it's around 80+ RS now it's all due to import of oil charge and tax,Central tax and State tax. So please stop sharing such false message
2290 2018-09-10 19:14:57 So the tea tree oil I use is diluted with sun flower seed oil, and I use enough to cover my whole face and neck area and then concentrate some directly where the blemish is.
2291 2018-09-10 19:14:55 Even the calendar calculation in in agreement with this date...
2292 2018-09-10 19:14:51 Right, and my understanding is that antidepressants (and lithium and fish oil and exercise) ultimately affect gene regulation to upregulate cytoprotective proteins and down regulate cytotoxic chemicals.  Also, wouldn't we see more genetic developmental problems in infants exposed
2293 2018-09-10 19:14:50 Sure thing. That's why people are driving for hours to see him and showing up in same numbers as when there was a 90% certainty he would lose. 
2294 2018-09-10 19:14:43 yet think of names both Oil & Habs fans bounced
2295 2018-09-10 19:14:41 Get an onion. Duct tape it to a nearby lamppost. Then store all of your whale oil in your oilskin boots.
2296 2018-09-10 19:14:35 @elonmusk Elon, i'm a dreamer like you. I'm a hardcore engineer like you. But the priority now is fighting global warming, not trying to escape. The amazonian forest being sold to oil companies, and Indonesia forest being use for palm oil culture: let's team up and do sthg!

2300 2018-09-10 19:14:04 I bet you don’t want to know that Rainie has an electric oil filled radiator and the means of making cocoa and brandy in her van.
2301 2018-09-10 19:13:58 Germany passed us about 15 years ago. It was said then that we were missing out on a huge job market. Obama tried to invest more in clean energy, but the GOP fought him on every step he proposed. They belong to Big Oil, don't care about jobs.
2302 2018-09-10 19:13:50 If everyone agrees "NIMBY," maybe it's time to increase the use of alternative transportation fuels. Would reduce the need to despoil everyone's oceans, rivers, farmlands — and views — with additional oil drilling.

2304 2018-09-10 19:13:41 While my truck is in for an oil change and a handful of minor fixes (after getting its pavement-is-for-sissies new tires) Penny and I are out and about on my electric assist bike, wasting time in town. We just got some fro-yo; now it’s time to check out the new PetSmart.
2305 2018-09-10 19:13:33 i remember reading that if you wash your hair daily then it ends up getting greasy super fast (vicious cycle) to compensate washing so if you wait out a week(?) your hair should stop overproducing oil. might wanna look into that? because washing hair daily is harmful iirc

2307 2018-09-10 19:13:03 Always wear gloves when handling any chemicals as cleaners are designed to remove oil and grease as well as the natural oils in your skin.
2308 2018-09-10 19:13:02 Our enthusiasm for the lipid of the month can be difficult to contain. Especially when olive oil is involved. ;)
2309 2018-09-10 19:12:58 Now let’s stop fracking this beautiful state and charge a tax (like other states on oil companies) taking the oil and gas from California.

2312 2018-09-10 19:12:42 Omg thank you! I used a lil bit of baby oil right now and it’s a whole new world. Before I was like why the fuck does it feel like I’m using a crayon

2316 2018-09-10 19:12:26 Whether you believe in climate change or not, we are running out of fossil fuels (50-60 years for oil, 100-150 for coal). Now is the time to start looking at alternate fuel sources, not when it's too late.
2317 2018-09-10 19:12:24 المبتعثين في امريكا لسه اول سبوع في المعهد تقولو in Saudi Arabia oil is cheaper than milk ? 
2318 2018-09-10 19:12:17 yessir, we actually have multiple. this 04 was due for an oil change.
2319 2018-09-10 19:12:17 Again: why are you claiming that we only have these things due to oil money? Every other developed nation has new schools & hospitals since the 70's regardless of oil; why do you believe we would not without it?
Why do you think that Norways doesn't because they have an oil fund?
2320 2018-09-10 19:12:15 Sir these oil bonds were issued to domestic OMC as payment guarantee to keep oil prices lower when compared to International market, this has been going on for years it's not new in India, but 1.44 crore's(minus interest) is a debatable no.
2321 2018-09-10 19:12:04 Sir also mention the crude oil prices per barrel both the time in 2014 it was more than 100$ per barrel but today it is less

2328 2018-09-10 19:10:48 Then why were you people crying in 2012 ?? Wasn't it depends on international crude oil price at that time ?
2329 2018-09-10 19:10:39 Agreed but that would have to be negotiated. Again trade moves across all provincial borders and regardless what a few say about Alberta oil bottom line is the demand is there. Again, under the current environment and bill c-69 Alberta has no leverage.
2330 2018-09-10 19:10:29 your so tight!! it costs you more in oil with that dilapidated piece of antique crud, than it would to replace! 
2331 2018-09-10 19:10:24 As u r baseless hence overlooking of base i.e INTNL CRUDE OIL RATE had to be kept hidden frm bhakgans inspired by Entire Political Science grad 

@INCIndia @RahulGandhi instead of mocking bjp it cell for its inherent stupidity and illiteracy,  u could hv highlighted crude oil

2337 2018-09-10 19:09:35 The "Gartman of the North" calls have been so brutal. Even a broken clock is right twice a day, far better than JS's calls. Remember his call for $50 oil by May 2018. We all do, but JS seems to not want to talk about that call. Crickets from him on that,
2338 2018-09-10 19:09:34 Modi, will you discuss skyrocketing oil prices and Rupee smashing records?

2345 2018-09-10 19:08:39 Getting rid of a pro Oil Tory Government will achieve a lot more.
2346 2018-09-10 19:08:27 This is the man who has I think two Hurricanes barreling towards the east coast but is more concerned with having aide get in front of reports to lie about numbers/economic growth and what Obama said. All he is is lies and snake oil. A Petty adolescent child runs this country.
2347 2018-09-10 19:08:27 Why did she do it .... Did they have a gun pointed at her and she couldn't get out of harms way so she threw the oil ..... Or did they just call her a fat Biyatch and she threw it .... It makes a great difference !!!!!
2348 2018-09-10 19:08:21 Like I said, it took oil money to get you trophies after a 40+ year drought
2349 2018-09-10 19:08:19 @jkenney will you be cutting personal taxes or just for oil and gas industry. Will you keep the 25 buck daycare.

2371 2018-09-10 19:05:46 The care industry has long been under valued. The problem is as much behavioural as it is understanding. Without healthcare, childcare,aged care, the country would be largely unproductive. Change the thinking that not everyone works in mining or oil, then maybe understand

2375 2018-09-10 19:05:20 Yet another quote that disputes your interpretation:
"The biggest drivers of the blue-collar hiring surge are the rebound in oil prices, the need to rebuild after disasters such as Hurricanes Irma and Harvey, and rising demand generated by a growing economy".
2376 2018-09-10 19:05:14 Not a joke. Just a dumb question

If there was no war on Syria, Iranian gas and oil would have been flowing 6 years ago, sold @ & 20/barrel to anyone in unlimited quantities

If Assad lost in first year, it would have been Qatari gas and Saudi oil

2383 2018-09-10 19:04:17 IS IT NORMAL AND OK TO USE OLIVE OIL INSTEAD OF LUBE????

It's irresistible apparently
2388 2018-09-10 19:03:31 Still many check marks to go to become the "Green Governor" such as closing down oil/gas wells near communities, closing down #AlisoCanyon, which has been sickening thousands of residents, banning fracking. #BrownsLastChance
2389 2018-09-10 19:03:26 The Toronto Sun is owned by an American hedge fund, had the publisher of The National Enquirer on its board, has a mandate to support the oil companies over Canadians and is working to bring US style conservatism to Canada. The @CPC_HQ only wants money and power. All propaganda.
2390 2018-09-10 19:03:12 Another self goal by Cong if you observe closely

Between 2004-14, if % increase in crude oil prices were much higher than % increase in per liter price of petrol, who then was paying for the deficits?

Anti-Modi brigade gormlessly thinks it was paid from SoniaG's own pockets!
2391 2018-09-10 19:03:11 the guy who always changes my oil at woodmans thought I moved out of state because he hasn’t seen me in a while and was wondering if I was ok.  #friendgoals
2392 2018-09-10 19:02:59 I knew someone lived on salt and vinegar butties.

Pretty sure I lived on 20p noodles and value custard creams for several months.

Seriously though - oil, tinned beans, tinned tomatoes, massive bag of lentils, value onions, sack of pasta, bag of rice, curry paste. Sorted.
2393 2018-09-10 19:02:42 Personally, I worked week-by-week and week-end, ate bread with olive oil, and brine tuna cans to pick up the bread hardens! not the same world. Good luck to her

2397 2018-09-10 19:02:09 Dein's reputation has been massively over enhanced. Our problems coincided with oil money coming in to the PL.

2424 2018-09-10 18:59:24 Then just stick to the shares you like and stop discouraging people to buy based on your own views, for me it’s gonna go from strength to strength. They have commercial oil so not sure why your describe it as a piece of shit, sounds like a vendetta to me, it usually is
2425 2018-09-10 18:59:19 It’s backed by the Barrel of oil, opec cartel, and US military might.

2432 2018-09-10 18:57:36 I agree! They should lock up Obama, too, for allowing BP Oil to drill in the Gulf of Mexico (causing one of the worst environmental disasters in the history of the US in April 2010). Dirty politicians only care about $$$

2435 2018-09-10 18:57:28 Really unwise.why petroleum products price rise?dont we have crude oil and oil refinery industry in the kenyan soil?..

2440 2018-09-10 18:57:06 Martin Truex Jr.: "Had some brake issues right from the get-go. Had a really strong car, felt like we were gonna have something for them today, unfortunately lost a brake rotor there and it went through the oil cooler." 

A frustrating end to Martin's day at @IMS.
2441 2018-09-10 18:56:58 face oil. setiap varian ada kegunaannya masing masing. coba share in jar disini @RLZEEEEE cari yg sesuai buat wajah kamu^^
2442 2018-09-10 18:56:55 isn't there an oil crunch, storm season... what's the gdp?
2443 2018-09-10 18:56:47 We totally agree on the sugar and vegetable oil.
2444 2018-09-10 18:56:34 I h8 getting my oil changed bc I feel uncomfortable not having my keys on me
2445 2018-09-10 18:56:31 I'm not buying the opposition views either. But they have spoken.   The government has to come with better plan sooner than later. And the oil producers have to come the table for it to work.
2446 2018-09-10 18:56:31 Expected jobs in the oil sector will be 13,000 #OilUg @nbstv
2447 2018-09-10 18:56:22 burnt both my hands with hot oil... now I can barely type #painful
2448 2018-09-10 18:56:22 2) Total crude ool import per day, 184 crore ltr.
Out of this remove gas, diesel, lube oil, resudual oil, chemicals, and biggest of all, petrolium product for export.

So remaining petrol for consumption is lets consider 40% only.
Its approx 72 crore ltr only
Cons< 1 ltr per day.
2449 2018-09-10 18:56:10 I think that would probably be the best solution. We don't get car insurance to pay for our gas, oil changes, and new tires. It makes no sense for insurance middle-men to be taking money on every transaction.

Obviously, this doesn't apply to Medicaid or the poor.
2450 2018-09-10 18:56:03 After I wash my face, I rub a small amount of sweet almond oil on my face and get a hot towel and place it on my face for a minute. Then I just wipe it away with the same towel. Then I tone, and moisturize. This works really good if you want to get rid of acne/dark spots.
2451 2018-09-10 18:55:56 #Palmoil giant @Indofood’s illegal abuse is well documented. @Nestle & @PepsiCo’s business partner uses child labour & has intimidated communities from their homes to make way for palm oil plantations. RT to pressure @RSPOtweets to stop certifying exploitation Indofood
2452 2018-09-10 18:55:42 You kniw you're getting old when the thought of the fire heating the radiators makes you excited!! Think of all the money we'll save on oil! 
2453 2018-09-10 18:55:39 Has @PressSec even showered this week? She looks filthy, and not in a good way. Look at the grease in her hair! Was she bobbing for donuts in fryer oil?
2454 2018-09-10 18:55:37 Everyone talking about why oil is hike and bjp spokepeeson only interested in bandh
2455 2018-09-10 18:55:33 I think it's a curse.
Anytime I decide to prepare myself a good dinner, gas will finish 
I just ate undone rice with raw pepper and palm oil.

2463 2018-09-10 18:54:56 @MsBernadetteB as per our convo yesterday this will happen to me  @skydart  I have a question would CBD oil come up in any tests? Trying to adjust pain management. Just spoke to Bernadette about this last night.
2464 2018-09-10 18:54:49 Yes I’m so glad we talked about it... because now I’ll probably be able to find ways to cope with it if it ever happens again ... I’ll definitely try the lavender oil... hope you sleep well tonight too
2465 2018-09-10 18:54:49 Yes, but the bright side is that now news is not monopolised anymore. And shenanigans like oil bonds are for all to see
2466 2018-09-10 18:54:38 Correct, the energy economy is currently centred around oil.
2467 2018-09-10 18:54:20 jun's kitchen made his wife chapsick and massage oil with preserved flowers inside of it, when will any bitch ever do something like that for me wtf
2468 2018-09-10 18:54:18 Ugh this morning i dropped some vitamin e oil on my dress and now it has a stain, from now on I’m Rejecting skincare

2474 2018-09-10 18:53:51 Excellent, disclosed comparison that reflects UPA's tall crude oil hikes and it's hike % surpasses NDA's in many fold .

2476 2018-09-10 18:53:33 Wow, the LF brake rotor was the problem on the 78. Rotor came apart and hit an oil line or radiator. Came through the hood and tore that up. So we can put a bow on Truex’s day with that note. #NASCAR
2477 2018-09-10 18:53:30 Certain Albertans always seem to get angry at the rest of the country when the oil market goes bust and they discover that money that was going to be invested in alternatives was never put aside.
2478 2018-09-10 18:53:29 I can see the oil painting now, for historic posterity.
2479 2018-09-10 18:53:22 Fundamentals across the board says he stays.
2480 2018-09-10 18:53:22 Right front looked fine. Left front I think. Either that or his oil cooler just exploded lol.
2481 2018-09-10 18:53:21 Coconut oil and Argan oil are your friends.
2482 2018-09-10 18:53:08 Leave it to josh to say he will take my car to get a oil change 
2483 2018-09-10 18:53:08 This oil diffuser is the best thing I’ve ever bought!! It’s so therapeutic.
2484 2018-09-10 18:53:03 concern with  palm oil is that it needs to not be hydrogenated and even RSPO certified has concerns about rainforest devestation - so ethically too should we be increasing the use of #palmoil ?  I think not.

2491 2018-09-10 18:52:17 HIV Epidemic, Final Disposition of Blighted Ovum law, the millions it cost taxpayers in 3 states to clean up Kiel Bros. Oil Co. stations...oh wait, those are all horrible not notable
2492 2018-09-10 18:52:11 That time crude oil was at 110 a barrel. Now it’s 70. Where’s the reduction in price?
2493 2018-09-10 18:52:07 What moisturizer/oil do you use for your weave  ?
2494 2018-09-10 18:52:05 Bhai Saab, please check oil level prices at international level. Then make your comments. Salary increased by 300% in 9 years?

2496 2018-09-10 18:51:53 Looks to me like a brake rotor failed, hit an oil line or water line on the 78
2497 2018-09-10 18:51:38 I understand. I did the same yesterday. I don't do the oil I do the powder and it works perfect for me. Brings me out of my seizures quicker and with less side effects from one.
2498 2018-09-10 18:51:21 Nothing is safe, when overdosed - that’s a normal thing - Please stop scaring people. Tea tree oil is a wonderful thing when used carefully, like every herb or essential oil
2499 2018-09-10 18:51:15 Ehhh it depends 
It’s an aint I fungial/bacteria type of oil so any impurities in the scalp it cleanses our without removing too much of your own sebum but the good news is you can add it to damn near anything. I use it for my shampoos and breakouts mostly
2500 2018-09-10 18:51:14 We are wondering the same thing in the media center. Can’t figure it out. Heard them say something on the radio about how he thought he had enough oil left to run it in the garage, but I am honestly not sure.

2549 2018-09-10 18:45:52 Close....that one looks more Keto. I added 1 can of corn, tomatoes, Italian dressing instead of the Olive Oil. I have made it before with Italian seasoning and Olive Oil which would make it more Keto as well. Yum. Sounds good. Now I'm hungry for shrimp salad. Lol.
2550 2018-09-10 18:45:42 What will govt. do in that if price of raw oil per barrel is increasing. We import around 80% of oil. Also, I have seen people using vechiles for short distance even if in a family 3 people each having car use their own instead of sharing. How will cost reduce then? Think on it.

2555 2018-09-10 18:45:13 I did, and I found all the good stuff that the media doesn't want you to know. Let me ask you something. Did Americans and Europeans kill Gadafi because he was a dictator or did they kill him because his socialism benefited his country and not them and their greed for libia's oil

2576 2018-09-10 18:42:40 Congratulations again, you found safe harbour in a rough time. Getting away from the oil patch is a path to sanity in these economic times.

2580 2018-09-10 18:42:22 and this new RSS born thug was shown on channels as oil expert but was a RSS mole. Shame on you.

2582 2018-09-10 18:42:20 Boredom and sobriety is equivalent to oil and water
2583 2018-09-10 18:42:04 15 of the hijackers on 9/11 were from Saudi Arabia. 2 were from UAE. That’s 17 our of 19. But no travel bans against either nation. Gee, I wonder why?? Wealthy, oil rich nations.

2586 2018-09-10 18:41:39 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Raleigh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

2589 2018-09-10 18:41:31 yesterday i gave donald the option between 5 of my oil paintings from class at DC to keep and he gave the hardest no to all 5. hurt. tried to say they didn’t match his room decor:(
2590 2018-09-10 18:41:27 Tax Cuts for the RIch...Regulations cut for the mighty oil companies...keep going so we can ruin the planet. Nice Job Mr. FAKE NEWS HIMSELF!!!
2591 2018-09-10 18:41:25 3. This is Nigeria greatest problem...!

Even the oil is drilled by foreign companies. We do nothing other than share the sales proceeds.

Let's bow our head and think
2592 2018-09-10 18:41:13 I've been waiting almost 2 hours for my car's oil change I'M SO UPSET about this wasted time.
2593 2018-09-10 18:41:10 in medical situations like these, peanut oil helps your body in the fast absorption of potatoes (bacon fat, too).
2594 2018-09-10 18:41:05 a chance.....oil may fly
2595 2018-09-10 18:40:59 Wow...the scam that is marketing coconut oil as "nutrient dense" to eat when it's basically 80% saturated fat.

The only one which leaves with cargo is filled with Charcoal, Gypsum Salt and Sesame Seeds. 

180 million people eating, sleeping and contributing nothing to the world. All we do is drill oil, sell it, bank the money and share the proceeds!
2602 2018-09-10 18:40:27 Venezuela demanded 30% of Oil profits on all fossil fuel extracted.

2604 2018-09-10 18:40:20 Good to know this. But crude prices have redused drastically in bjps time. Many people are aware abt burden left by upa government as oil bonds too.
2605 2018-09-10 18:40:16 So you put this under the Fossil fuel post so we can see what violence oil fuels along with its other uses?

2607 2018-09-10 18:40:05 And I would disagree, if the rest of Canada wants Alberta to stay, there will need to be a lot of changes to happen, one of which is the abolition of equalization payments, secondly a pipeline to tidewater for our oil
2608 2018-09-10 18:39:58 why these fools cannot simply sale the damn oil
2609 2018-09-10 18:39:32 It is physically and mentally demanding but I know a lot of women who work in the oil patch that held their job because they do a good job. Oil companies will hire women if they apply and are qualified for the job.
2610 2018-09-10 18:39:32 I wonder if there has been any oil spill modelling for that area and if so where would I get access to it?

I have fished that area many, many times. Strong currents, many islands and bays. This could be very ugly.

2614 2018-09-10 18:39:29 those drilling for oil at Horsehill, Surrey, have today announced they are flaring 15000 cu ft of gas constantly per day, basically, they are burning and wasting the equivalent output of 7300 solar panels every day. Filling our air with pollutants. @MLiebreich
2615 2018-09-10 18:39:27 Dear @HRajaBJP, , please put out a comprehensive video explaining the Petrol Price rise and the Cong scam of Oil Bonds. These information "thunukkugal" is not enough to counter the opposition narrative.
2616 2018-09-10 18:39:20 No experience on my scalp but I’ve dealt with severe psoriasis on my hands and feet. Tea tree oil helps with the itching and CBD oil believe it or not. Other than that, the the medicated crap until it eventually clears  sorry you’re suffering. It’s awful
2617 2018-09-10 18:39:16 I'd say use some really good soap and some tea tree oil. If that doesn't work, get our ya best concealer haha
2618 2018-09-10 18:39:16 Get yourself educated, preferably from a school that teaches science and math. The crude oil doesn't go to your tank directly. It has to incur processing costs, transportation costs and salaries, that haven't decreased. And ofcourse, past sins of the UPA had to be paid for.
2619 2018-09-10 18:39:07 China to take over 30 oil fields in Niger Delta Region  (Biafra Land) 
To offset the monumental loan Nigeria owe  them
2620 2018-09-10 18:39:06 OMG I did this a few years ago and they actually figured out a way. I tried oil, vaseline and I even wrapped the damn pole with tape and put thumb tacks pointing out to keep them off. They kept beating me at my own game. But it makes for hilarious viewing!! LOL
2621 2018-09-10 18:38:55 so i brought my car to get an oil change and there’s this seriously intimidating guy sitting near me with the cutest little french bulldog and it’s the most adorable sight ever my heart is combusting
2622 2018-09-10 18:38:47 all modern countries have national debt. both China and the US owe trillions, but that doesnt mean theyre held hostage by their debtors

China gets oil that it needs to function its economy, but it certainly isnt behaving like the West
2623 2018-09-10 18:38:44 So I trekked 7.8km inside rain 
2624 2018-09-10 18:38:32 yeah its probs the ferments or tea tree oil in it thats botherin u
2625 2018-09-10 18:38:30 Good evening Heid                                              I was in the changing room, trying my wedding suit on when the RNS pinged on my Mb, I had my fiancé and my daughter outside and with my trousers only half on, I just had to read it 
2626 2018-09-10 18:38:22 need to get my hands on some CBD oil asap
2627 2018-09-10 18:38:02 great interview to understand why Canada's views on human rights, environmental make no sense. We say we care but.....we are buying oil from places that have no standards for human life, women or environment. We are supporting that behavior by buying it.
2628 2018-09-10 18:38:01 It's not going to stop there is to much money behind oil and politicians in every country willing to take it and look the other way.
2629 2018-09-10 18:37:41 @10DowningStreet those drilling for oil at Horsehill, Surrey, have today announced they are flaring 15000 cu ft of gas constantly per day, basically, they are burning and wasting the equivalent output of 7300 solar panels every day.

2630 2018-09-10 18:37:28 I’m slowly becoming that girl that smells like coconut oil and curry 
2631 2018-09-10 18:37:28 than in a hair/skin/nails supplement it'll be a higher amount of biotin (more biotin=quicker hair growth, in theory). Apparently brewers yeast tablets/powder can help too. Also lots of people with my condition swear by castor oil (rubbing it onto the hair) (2/2)
2632 2018-09-10 18:37:28 You can get a big bowl that won't tip over, fill the bottom with coconut oil that way when we tries to get out he slips and stays in the bowl. Pretty easy trap to mark yourself that's humane :]
2633 2018-09-10 18:37:25 is this Oil Bond my MMS govt is really real, why not Modi n Co never spoke about this
2634 2018-09-10 18:37:10 Change your own damn oil then, Kroger man lmao

2636 2018-09-10 18:37:10 Remember the old snake oil salesman from the carnival days? The guy who 
could sell absolutely useless "tonics" to gullible hicks? Well, he has evolved through time to a perfect example of his kind: Barack Hussein Obama, hustler extraordinaire. Lying liar with a charming smile
2637 2018-09-10 18:37:10 We have the lowest taxes (by far) of any province. When a drop in oil prices (once again) causes a $10B hole in your revenue stream, which is 1/5 of your total spending budget, it tells me that we have an over dependence on oil royalties. Boom/bust cycles need to end.
2638 2018-09-10 18:37:08 Never mind that those charts are garbage. Business investment declined due to the collapse in oil prices in 2014-2016. When oil recovered, so did the associated fracking investment.
2639 2018-09-10 18:36:50 -gets oil changed-
“Hey you have 1000 things wrong with your car”
Me: yeah but money
2640 2018-09-10 18:36:41 waiting for 2019 election to take a decision on oil prices .
2641 2018-09-10 18:36:32 Bought some hair oil. Smells super feminine. Tight.
2642 2018-09-10 18:36:31 WTH, I just added oil to my car, then antifreeze. just normal maintenance, the rest of the water in the bucket was tossed, then it hit my pants now my GS9+ says the charging port detected moisture... arghhhhh
2643 2018-09-10 18:36:31 Bullet coffee? Like the butter and coconut oil one?
2644 2018-09-10 18:36:30 all due respect.  Make your own logical decisions. However, you do notice a trend? The Holy Water Popoff(sp?) guy didn't get where he did without help in his snake oil routine. You get enough people believing your Q stories, the followers will start getting lax on responsibility.
2645 2018-09-10 18:36:26 I think my car needs a oil change maybe some water in there but I just drive it 
2646 2018-09-10 18:36:24 Gobhi sarkar itni chalak h jab Crude oil prices kam hue to roz duty badhai, taaki apna pet bharta rahe aur janta tak faida na pahunche.
Jab price badhne lage to us waqt hath khade kar rhe hain k ji humare hath me to kuch hai hi nahi. Inko lagta h sara India bhakto jaisa chomu h
2647 2018-09-10 18:36:19 Yup. Back in the days when the gov't actually paid attention to monopolistic behaviors.

But you can replace that with "oil industry" and it's good to go.
2648 2018-09-10 18:36:16 @KevinHassett = Snake oil salesman. Would anyone like to wipe that insulting grin off his face, besides me. RT
2649 2018-09-10 18:36:15 おっちん
2650 2018-09-10 18:36:13 Sir, in today's DNA you were more behaving like BJP's lawyer. Your reports of fuel increase were one sided as you didn't mention crude oil prices from 2004. @sudhirchaudhary @ZeeNews
2651 2018-09-10 18:36:13 PETROL Rates: 01/09/13

₹74.10 - Delhi
₹81.57 - Kolkata 
₹81.57 - Mumbai

PETROLRates: 01/09/18

₹78.68 - Delhi
₹81.60 - Kolkata 
₹86.09 - Mumbai

Now, If You Talk 'Crude Oil Rates'

Surely..I will Talk 'Inflation', Dollar Rates, 2 Lac Cr Oil Bonds', 6.5 Bn$ Iran Bill e.t.c
2652 2018-09-10 18:36:11 Oil the hinges every once in a while. Fucking slacker.
2653 2018-09-10 18:36:10 For me it's been CBD oil but I'ma have to try this too
2654 2018-09-10 18:36:08 Wow, really triggered. And how does "The Fart in the Room" plan on shipping oil through "this stupid thing called confederation" when it faces resistance as part of confederation? If you really believe resistance will be lessened by separation, then I fear that you are a fool.
2655 2018-09-10 18:35:59 Lavender oil, or cbd cream. rub it on your temples. Thank me later.
2656 2018-09-10 18:35:38 My thoughts and prayers are with the families that got affected in the #Nasarrawa oil explosion
2657 2018-09-10 18:35:36 Hard facts or hard to digest facts?
In spite of giving us the costliest  fuel, weakest rupee ever, in spite of amenable crude oil prices, you come up with weird explanations for your failure. Stop fooling us!
2658 2018-09-10 18:35:31 Okay, you have a valid point, those are provincial. They add up to billions. Federally there are investment incentives, to attract foreign capital, that are used by foreign based oil companies,  amongst others.
2659 2018-09-10 18:35:30 When you strike oil under your plot on the trailer park.....
2660 2018-09-10 18:35:12 526+ years. Please don't mention the buffalo or wolves.
If there was a genuine effort to do better...But the attack on the Standing Rock Sioux because they don't want their water source poisoned by tar sands oil, or their sacred sites destroyed, shows there isn't any change.
2661 2018-09-10 18:35:07 The Yocan Hive 2.0 makes vaping oil or wax on the DL fucking simple. $20 or less on eBay so no loss if you gotta ditch it.
2662 2018-09-10 18:35:01 i dont regret buying

though the trend of releasing buggy, 80% finished games with glitchy combat is annoying

otoh the 'unfinished games' thing isnt a problem unique to spider-man which is otherwise solid

(hard to overstate how good web slinging feels)
2663 2018-09-10 18:34:53 Cool. If you don't own an oil well meeting the production threshold to be taxed, you have nothing to worry about. Also, keep in mind that funding of essential state services has to come from somewhere. Feel free to go back a few years and notice what caused the current shortfall.
2664 2018-09-10 18:34:44 Show me the data. Oil well footprint vs rare metal mine.
2665 2018-09-10 18:34:42 Moral of the story is that you should NEVER bring the car in for an oil change.
2666 2018-09-10 18:34:21 Be sure you research the suppliers before you buy as there are a lot of companies out there making a quick buck with poor quality oil. We're fortunate to live in a pot-legalized state, so we have even more to choose from. 
2667 2018-09-10 18:34:10 Subaru of Glendale is garbage bro don’t service your car there... 7k miles two rods snapped on my STi after an oil change
2668 2018-09-10 18:34:04 Exfoliate once a week to scrub off dead cells that make skin look dull. When skin is freshly exfoliated, lotion and oil are better absorbed.
2669 2018-09-10 18:34:02 @TimesNow Today's bandh was absolutely necessary to reduce fuel prices on war footing. The ruling party and opposition should come together in both houses to bring oil & gas under GST or cut tax by 50%, otherwise face the consequences in the 2019 general election.

Also print howmuch debt thru oil bonds have been paid bk or to be paid.. #BharatBandhFail
2674 2018-09-10 18:33:39 I lowered my Subaru 3.5 inches and I can still change the oil without a jack which means Subarus are better than everything.

Thanks for coming to my Ted talk.
2675 2018-09-10 18:33:35 use apple cider vinegar, i use it as a toner (but you need to dilute it w water) and tea tree oil !
2676 2018-09-10 18:33:33 Hello Stuart! You can we just ask that you check to make sure that it does not need oil.  ~RG
2677 2018-09-10 18:33:30 Why I got to trust your weed if I don't know how you grow it,? Why there is powder if THC is oil,?
2678 2018-09-10 18:33:30 I’ve read that coconut oil is No Bueno.
2679 2018-09-10 18:33:14 This is insanely disingenuous on their part. Business investment had been dropping due to the collapse in oil-related spending when oil prices fell. To say that's a trend I garbage.
2680 2018-09-10 18:33:13 Even the poor people in the west are expendable. Look at the track record of big tobacco and big oil. Cancer, war, poverty inflicted on millions. We know this, we have known for decades and yet it still happens and we do little
2681 2018-09-10 18:32:54 明後日からゼミ旅行らしいが何一つわかっていない
2682 2018-09-10 18:32:53 Also rupee is at an historic low, but uska to baat nahi chalu hai. Also when oil prices go up, transport prices go up, food prices that make their way through market go up. Maybe we can live in comfort. What about a rickshaw driver or a maid or a person earning below avg wage!?
2683 2018-09-10 18:32:52 gotta go get my oil changed 
2684 2018-09-10 18:32:50 I would definitely use if I had in my fridge. Anchovies or sardines make the most tasty sauce on their own. I'd sauté it with two cloves of garlic in olive oil, break it into smaller pieces, as I stir, add chili flakes, chopped parsley and finish it with grated Parmesan
2685 2018-09-10 18:32:44 Help! 
Has anyone ever used Castor Oil for their eyes here? If yes, where can I get it from in #Lahore
2686 2018-09-10 18:32:42 love that the leader of the green party is upset with profit-sharing models instead of the actual oil
2687 2018-09-10 18:32:42 What about the 2lakh crore debt left by UPA on present govt. Seriously I want to know and is there any debt (loan) of present govt on oil?? As u hv accessed and analyses govt dat, pls enlighten us on that. Hope u will reply with  correct data..
2688 2018-09-10 18:32:39 Weak argument, oil price hike impacts on almost all items including transportation, private driving,rental vehicles etc.

2691 2018-09-10 18:32:25 You produce oil only to be refined in another country. I second this, let the oil be refined in kenya !
2692 2018-09-10 18:32:22 All machines need preventive maintenance looks like someone forgot to check the oil
2693 2018-09-10 18:32:22 I go all the way to Pontiac to my mechanic for oil changes when I can go 3 miles to the dealer. It is only waste full to outsiders.
2694 2018-09-10 18:32:18 honestly this is bizarre even by my middle class standards - I had The Student Vegetarian Cookbook, a bag of pasta, and some cheese. I thought I was fancy for having olive oil in?
2695 2018-09-10 18:32:15 JUST SAY NO TO BIG OIL!!
2696 2018-09-10 18:32:08 Why putting pressure on govt..some other work will be hampered by saving in fuel..let inflation worry us then it will be right otherwise very simple for sake of elections bring oil bonds reduce tax here and increase there it's all same.traffic jams continue so pub trans is way2go
2697 2018-09-10 18:32:01 1) #September11 Must know: In September 2000 the neocon #PNAC think tank stated that a more aggressive USA foreign policy was needed to gain control over the M-E and Persian Gulf oil. An invasion in Iraq was figured prominently in this document. Jeb Bush was part of #PNAC

2703 2018-09-10 18:31:41 If Calagarians are always the ones to take the brunt of an oil bust, wouldnt you think they would learn and be the one screaming the loudest for a diversification of the economy so that this doesnt happen to them again?
2704 2018-09-10 18:31:35 दुग्गल साब, Crude Oil ka Analysis kaun karega? Aapka Fufa ??
2705 2018-09-10 18:31:32 Tomatoes, olive oil, dough, and wine. :D
2706 2018-09-10 18:31:32 Wasn’t standard oil a rockerfeller co. That ended up having to be broken up?
2707 2018-09-10 18:31:29 Mana boleh baby oil jd lubricant bege rusak kondomnya ntar wkwk
2708 2018-09-10 18:31:28 I guess the idea behind that is that if you accidentally set oil on fire and you cover it with flour fast enough, you will deprive the fire of oxygen? Wet flour might actually work
2709 2018-09-10 18:31:23 No one cares about geopolitics. The oil story will be about supply not keeping pace with demand.
2710 2018-09-10 18:31:17 @nailogical how do your fingers and keyboard not get oily when you apply your nail oil pen at work?

2715 2018-09-10 18:30:57 i know i'm 2000 and late to the whole coconut oil thing, but if you wanna smell like a nice toasted coconut cookie just slather some on
2716 2018-09-10 18:30:52 Make the U.K. into Venezuela - without the oil.
2717 2018-09-10 18:30:47 Me: *Spits out oil* WHAT—
2718 2018-09-10 18:30:39 So I use this really nice smelling beard oil and it makes me sad a little bit because I’m the only one who can smell it when it’s on. So sometimes I wanna just go up to people and be like “hey, smell my beard”
2719 2018-09-10 18:30:38 Still absolutely loving the Spider-Man game, still taking CBD oil which is working wonders, still the same OG but I been lowkey.

2722 2018-09-10 18:30:30 i don’t eat grains or soybeans. although wheat grass maybe good depending on the nutrient density of the soil where it’s grown. wheat germ oil is load with vitamin E. i don’t eat any of these.
2723 2018-09-10 18:30:26 The Bengals-Colts boxscore listed the attendance as 58,699 yesterday at Lucas Oil Stadium, which is way short of a sellout. 

Indy friends, was the game blacked out on WTTV? Pretty embarrassing considering the circumstances of Andrew Luck’s return.

2726 2018-09-10 18:29:59 @SupriyaShrinate #FuelOnFire excellent panel debate on fuel price rise across all channels... and the harsh economic fallout if oil prices are subsidised /lowered .
2727 2018-09-10 18:29:53 So what can we eat.Animals are give antibiotics, vegetables are full of chemicals. Don't start on sugar , Oil.
2728 2018-09-10 18:29:41 Nobody sells more CBD oil in the U.S.
2729 2018-09-10 18:29:27 Is photo k saath 2004 se ab tak ka kacche oil ka bhi rate daalte to kuch kahne layak rahte lekin vo aap nhi daloge q ki vahan aapka failure aapko saamne dikhta hai . you proved that u are only eligible to sell pakora and chai just go and do that . jumla party
2730 2018-09-10 18:29:20 argon oil makes it a really shine, and ion has light colors, arctic fox is vegan i think & i like their colors, and manic panic is a good default

2734 2018-09-10 18:28:58 AND GET ARGAN OIL FOR UR HAIR SO IT'S NOT AS DRY and so it wont look like a toilet brush
2735 2018-09-10 18:28:47 Mrs Diaz, and Vandersteel are colluding on the larp narrative.    To say they are not involved, is ridiculous.  There is a reason for youtube videos showing off new $8k computer rigs.. paid for by patreon/web fees. Selling snake oil, and denying the scam? legal org/com $ issues.
2736 2018-09-10 18:28:43 Beaver Creek? That figures. Beavers! We build! Shale oil destroys. Guess who wins? No prizes!
2737 2018-09-10 18:28:41 You wouldn’t like me without my CBD oil
2738 2018-09-10 18:28:39 If states want your money, they will find a way. People game systems. Not discounting the value of blockchain, there are no silver bullets. Tech alone cannot solve a people problem. Will the USA allow a free oil market on crypto? Demonetization led to compliance/ prepare for NPA.
2739 2018-09-10 18:28:29 Why is @BJP4India @narendramodi not considering to include oil in #GST..?
2740 2018-09-10 18:28:26 What did you used to do in oil and gas? Congrats, BTW!
2741 2018-09-10 18:28:24 But first, CBD oil
2742 2018-09-10 18:28:20 Crude Oil price
2743 2018-09-10 18:28:15 But do I use the lavender oil?!
2744 2018-09-10 18:28:01 I just had a visual of 32% of the crowd at the local fair buying snake oil from a carnie who says it will make them rich, look better, being bountiful crops next spring and most importantly make America great again!! 
2745 2018-09-10 18:27:54 Oil & Gas industry forecast is Bleak & there END is Certain in the World in the coming days ahead..

2746 2018-09-10 18:27:53 i like argon oil, manic panic, ion, & arctic fox!
2747 2018-09-10 18:27:48 It's not about liberals or conservatives. It's about fair representation, after the racist, anti-union, illegal gerrymandering, anti-women, corporate give aways to oil companies, insurance firms, and Republican corporate paymasters dictating to you and your fellow stooge's.
2748 2018-09-10 18:27:44 Cologne is the oil type while perfume is d spray type

2753 2018-09-10 18:27:21 And you learned this aboard a UFO talking to Bigfoot, sitting next to Elvis.  There is zero reliable evidence that CBD oil does a thing for cancer.  More conspiracy nonsense from the pothead community.  #givemeabreak
2754 2018-09-10 18:27:19 WARNING!!!
Do not collect any #100 note that still looks very neat, its a fake currency, the #100 note that's genuine, will look dirty, tattered and have a stain of red oil or akamu on it.
2755 2018-09-10 18:27:18 my coworker who voted for jill stein is now posturing that cbd oil cures cancer, and as a person who believes heavily in natural treatments, i can’t emphasize enough that you DO NOT CONFLATE CURES WITH TREATMENTS
2756 2018-09-10 18:27:10 waking up and forgetting I put coconut oil in my hair the night before really be humbling I look like it’s 1367 and I’m ready for my yearly bath
2757 2018-09-10 18:27:08 If OIL HIKE is one of the factors of inflation rate, then why not increase tax for cars? Make the cheapest to millions so PH will decrease imports of oil from other countries plus reduction of traffic. Naisip ko lang Few cars, few crudo. Right?

2759 2018-09-10 18:26:44 Finally getting the oil changed in my car, unfortunately though, it'll be about an hour before they can get it in. Some luck right?
2760 2018-09-10 18:26:42 1000s of apartment buildings in #NYC burn dirty fuel oil. These buildings account for more particulate air pollution in the city than all of the trucks & cars. Divestment is a sideshow. @NYCMayor has done nothing to address this or plan to move these buildings to cleaner nat gas.
2761 2018-09-10 18:26:42 So... if corn oil is made of corn.. and vegetable oil is made of vegetables... what is Baby oil made of?!? #MondayMood
2762 2018-09-10 18:26:33 Kabhi kehte ho 2026 Tak paid karna hai oil bond ka Paisa, kabhi bolte ho paid Kar Diya, kaahe firki le rahe ho janta ki
2763 2018-09-10 18:26:27 I am not blind followers of any political party or politician.

Politicians & their blind followers joke always.

Like, In 2013, petrol was high when Center was taking Rs.9 tax on petrol & crude oil was $110.
But now petrol is not high for them bcz tax is Rs.19 & crude oil $70.
2764 2018-09-10 18:26:18 the same type of deal the OIL COMPANIES have with Alaska, except, pro-rated...the most unsafe users get MORE.
2765 2018-09-10 18:26:15 Done fell in love with coconut oil 
2766 2018-09-10 18:26:11 "After returning to Nigeria in 1983, Bola Tinubu joined Mobil Oil Nigeria, and later became an executive of the company"
2767 2018-09-10 18:26:07 Whoa!  I didn't think you could buy cbd oil outside of a collective 
2768 2018-09-10 18:25:56 @dallascowboys Jerry Jones you suck!!!! You may know oil, but you don't know SHIT about football. Wow! Unbelievable
2769 2018-09-10 18:25:47 Current age: old enough to take my own car for an oil change. 

Enough of a child to walk around with my hoodie pockets full of causes from Chick-fil-a.
2770 2018-09-10 18:25:47 Oil prices are a sham. Made up challenges that are supported by the analysts.
2771 2018-09-10 18:25:40 for me (and this does not apply u or other people), the best fats are wild caught fish, grass-fed meats, grass-fed butter, organic cold-pressed extra virgin olive oil, organic coconut oil, cod liver, organic grass-fed beef liver, avocados, olives, grass-fed aged cheeses & krill.
2772 2018-09-10 18:25:30 Or maybe the original electric vehicles that were developing at the same time would have taken precedence and millions of lives wouldn’t have been taken by exhaust and oil pollution?
2773 2018-09-10 18:25:23 There goes Kramer testing his oil tanker bladder system again.
2774 2018-09-10 18:25:20 But we have to note that the international crude oil prices since the UPA regime have come down but BJP govt has continued to hike the fuel prices in India. The lamest excuse they have is repayment of subsidy led debts under UPA regime.
2775 2018-09-10 18:25:10 Well come the fuck over ! I got clay face mask, hot oil treatments, I'll file and paint your nails or file them cause you csnt have nail polish at work but I'll do your toes ! And then I'll give you a back massage and get all those knots out !

2778 2018-09-10 18:24:45 Who give cheap standard oil changes in Valdosta? These folks taxing 
2779 2018-09-10 18:24:36 Other than the fact that this is still bad charting, u r still ignoring crude oil rates
2780 2018-09-10 18:24:35 Well, to be fair, you look like you've never even breathed next to soy products. You wouldn't have.
2781 2018-09-10 18:24:32 Bhakt hona achchi baat hai magar 'Bhakt' ho yeh prove karne ke liye kuch bhi comment kar dena achchi baat nahi! Chart ko goli maro, oil price bahot jyada badh chuka hai yeh reality hai & gareeb logon ko survive karne me agee muskil hoga. By the way, I am also a Modi supporter
2782 2018-09-10 18:24:26 There’s one other car in this place and it’s taking @pepboysauto  an hour and 30 min to change my oil... AND ITS STILL NOT DONE. Wtf.
2783 2018-09-10 18:24:19 I knew today wasn't gonna be my day... first I wake up late then my bus forgets to take its turn now I just spent almost 2 hours at the hospital cause I got fryer oil in my eyes at work
2784 2018-09-10 18:24:12 Soooooo I put coconut oil in my hair today and for some reason it smelled like curry. My hair smells like curry now. I wanna shave off my hair. :)
2785 2018-09-10 18:24:02 It’s the Trump family economy stupid. Russian loans. Russian real estate. Russian money laundering. Russian oil. Russian hacking.
2786 2018-09-10 18:23:57 My mother said
“Somebody who has plenty of money, will he be calling me like this, after he will say he has oil company, I don’t even know the car he’s driving”

This is where I died!! 
2787 2018-09-10 18:23:56 I hate waiting to get a oil change
2788 2018-09-10 18:23:55 And we would cut off electric power, fresh water  Uranium and Oil now we may be mild and have great manners but don't ever take that as a weakness and if we need we can also: invalidating US pharma. patents
2789 2018-09-10 18:23:49 Thank you AG Jeff Landry for fighting for our Louisiana oil industry jobs!
2790 2018-09-10 18:23:43 I've mastered small talk because the only thing I know anything about is oil paint and no one wants to talk about tinting strength across different brands at a party.
2791 2018-09-10 18:23:34 Ustime per barrel crude oil price kitna tha wo Jan lete
2792 2018-09-10 18:23:28 Can’t today, low on oil
2793 2018-09-10 18:23:07 Note to MSNBC - Stop booking Matt Schlapp !! He is the founder of CPAC & his wife, Mercedes, is communications director at the WH. He is a snake oil salesman who dominates interviews by loudly talking over the interviewer, glibly spewing propaganda.
2794 2018-09-10 18:23:05 Yeah but this is the price of petrol in India and it's fluctuation. We import oil and if the amount we pay is high the fuel cost is high and vice versa. I assume this is the first time where the Barrell prices have dropped, they were record low last year and our prices haven't.
2795 2018-09-10 18:23:04 #nlpoli the business environment where no business goes without the government wanting to be an equity stakeholder. Millions to @GriegNL - @CanopyGrowth - Oil&Gas Sector etc. Meanwhile provincial treasury in shambles.
2796 2018-09-10 18:23:02 Seattle (WA) Times-Business: Tribes say Trump illegally approved oil pipeline from Canada
2797 2018-09-10 18:23:02 It was great. After this we watched how Argan oil is produced from the popped nuts! An amazing tradition. These photos were taken in Agadir.
2798 2018-09-10 18:22:58 I sell CBD oil and I would NEVER say anything is safe for everyone. That one person may come along and have a reaction to something. Gotta be careful and not make promises
2799 2018-09-10 18:22:58 Who will tell the truth behind...2 lakh crore of oil debt bonds that u issued to OMC's that Modi govt had to pay. U started paying them in bonds instead of cash...Where will that money come from....Morons...
2800 2018-09-10 18:22:56 I said, our volumes of Oil exports should be high
2801 2018-09-10 18:22:56 Oil & gas operation in Ogaden is linked to the humanitarian & human rights crisis, forced displacement & instability & health risks in the HoA. The price of living near oil & gas shouldn’t be giving up your health & future. It's time to end the conflict in Somali region #Ethiopia
2802 2018-09-10 18:22:48 Lol we have an old oil drum in the front yard that we burn stuff in. It's totally normal.

Totally.

Normal.
2803 2018-09-10 18:22:29 If you buy me a light up oil diffuser thing I will
2804 2018-09-10 18:22:29 Cap and trade is not a solution but life support for an industry causing suffering and death across the planet. We need a real transition to 100% renewables. The technology is there and oil and gas subsidies should be redirected to solar, wind and geothermal.
2805 2018-09-10 18:22:12 Too much and blame @BJP4India was my vote! Reason - An official statement from Givernment missing as to why oil prices were higher in spite of crude oil prices dropping? Oil bonds etc but official statement is required! Isn’t it?
2806 2018-09-10 18:22:04 olive oil sautee chopped onions garlic and ginger then add sliced eggplant and zatar and turmeric and stir fry it till it gets medium mushy great w plain yogurt and rice or bread or anything
2807 2018-09-10 18:21:59 She sells one thing and one thing only: snake oil.

2809 2018-09-10 18:21:54 I wonder if bio oil works better than mederma?? 
2810 2018-09-10 18:21:46 Not right still. Constructive criticism is different from “Negative” reviews. 
And you can ask yours to be made oilless or with little oil. “I prefer mine with less oil” wld have been better
2811 2018-09-10 18:21:37 Lol. The partner will one day pour the oil on you not on shigidi.
2812 2018-09-10 18:21:35 何故か起きた
2813 2018-09-10 18:21:28 personally I love priming using Rose-hip oil, but before that I used to use Makeup forever's primer..
Setting spray I use Mac's
2814 2018-09-10 18:21:19 2000 followers, yeah good luck with that. Maybe build a wall around Alberta.  That should help you get your precious oil out.
2815 2018-09-10 18:21:14 وانتي بخير
2816 2018-09-10 18:21:02 TY this is awesome. I hope CA govt sees exploding oil refineries in our communities as much of a threat as coal
2817 2018-09-10 18:20:55 眠くならねえ
2818 2018-09-10 18:20:38 While lower oil prices benefited the economy, the immediate effects were awful. The energy loans made up about 16% of corporate bonds or $1.3 trillion in 2014 and the pain could not be absorbed until early 2016. Lots of jobs were lost in drilling and alt energy industries... 2/2
2819 2018-09-10 18:20:31 The GOP should excerpt clips of this garbage it will sink red state Dems like stones
2820 2018-09-10 18:20:27 I used 2 Big spoonfuls of Raw, unrefined Coconut oil.  I put in into about 24oz of coffee, mix into some cacao & maca powder, mix in unsweetened almond milk.  I used a frother to mix it up.  Drink up!  Then Follow it up with a jar of chx bone broth.  Best way to start your day!
2821 2018-09-10 18:20:20 This man puts oil on his chicken when him a season it... that’s a thing?

2824 2018-09-10 18:19:55 By the time this day go come den wanna bodies decompose make den mine we as oil.
2825 2018-09-10 18:19:51 Congress shd come with facts - they should tell us the rise in petrol prices in 5 yr of their rule (2008-13). They shd clarify their position abt oil bonds and they shd put the truth before public that they did not pay for petrol and this govt. had to pay for oil bonds.
2826 2018-09-10 18:19:38 Second cup of coffee in 3 hours and all I've done today is get my oil changed and start laundry.
2827 2018-09-10 18:19:33 For the first time, I noticed and appreciated the branding, 'Indane' for cooking gas. Not only does it rhyme with 'Indian' of Indian Oil, it also makes up a modernised version of 'Indhan', meaning 'fuel'.

Is there a legend behind it, .@IndianOilcl?
2828 2018-09-10 18:19:23 This nigga just asked to sit next to me while waiting for my oil to get changed and he just hit the vape like 10 times in under 20 seconds
2829 2018-09-10 18:19:21 Wasn’t expecting the Olive Oil bit, I’m sold
2830 2018-09-10 18:19:11 Ultimately upa $131 barrel ka petrol 74 me provide karti thi aur nda $84 ka crude oil 80.77 gkp me provide kara rahi hai.
Agar 100 ka bhi milega lena to hai hi.

2834 2018-09-10 18:18:50 When we moved to Canada in 2006 . Oil and gas industry was on full boom in Alberta . My husband experience was of overseas and in those days it was easy for almost every engineer to get opportunities in their related field if they landed in Alberta not Toronto .
2835 2018-09-10 18:18:39 @realDonaldTrump Been a supporter since day 1 & you've not only matched, but exceeded my expectations! Great economy, tax cuts, lower regulations, more oil & gas pipelines, got out of Iran deal etc. Now it's time to release the documents!
2836 2018-09-10 18:18:35 Their rigid lust thermometer dabbed in rose oil / anointed rose oil slithered into their moist jungle
2837 2018-09-10 18:18:10 @rsprasad Fuel prices n taxes highest in South Asia n it’s neighbouring countries ; and u refer to global oil pricing ; total diversion of facts when BJP Govt is bleeding us with 40% plus taxation ; can’t Fovt reduce ; why play diversion tactics ???
2838 2018-09-10 18:18:05 How about 2.1 GDP growth, lowest of any President ever, how about shutting coal industry down, over 200 coal power plants shut down. Over regulation, tried to kill oil industry drilling and exploring. Those are few starters. Should I continue? Dig a bit deeper ed,  TRUMP saved us
2839 2018-09-10 18:17:55 Also check the crude oil prices in the same yr.
2840 2018-09-10 18:17:40 Nan vraiment, ca sert à rien, ils seront dans le gacha permanent. Garde plutot pour le prochakn big event.

Sinon l'expedition XP qui coute des oil,c'est un bait, faut pas trop en abuser. Car tu ne gagnes ni loot, ni XP rank,ni blueprints
2841 2018-09-10 18:17:37 We haven’t had cabinet level energy meetings with the Russians since they invaded Crimea in 2014 so this is a real 180 from current policy.

No doubt Perry will be trading all the oil in Alaska for a trump hotel in Moscow and a pair of fancy Cossack boots.
2842 2018-09-10 18:17:28 Also, "originalism" = what the oil companies want
2843 2018-09-10 18:17:27 
2844 2018-09-10 18:17:21 Overhearing some old Caucasian Democrats talking about wanting to punch a Texas oil man in the face because he’s killing the planet... #ILoveNYC 
2845 2018-09-10 18:17:15 Getting oil change, head light , fog light , and tag light  done. Later maybe car cleaning.#MobilOne

2848 2018-09-10 18:17:03 I put my plug on my old coworker & that nigga buys $200+ a week and my plug give me....commission I guess you could say free bud & oil for my vape pen 
2849 2018-09-10 18:16:58 jab 2019 me harkar shayad modiji ajtak par ayenge tab pata chalega ki crude oil sasta hone k bad petroldiesel costly Ku h
2850 2018-09-10 18:16:56 actually, i had wild caught sardines and alaskan pick salmon with organic cold-pressed extra virgin olive oil & organic unrefined virgin coconut oil. brazil nuts, blanched almonds & pistachios. manchego, goat cheddar & goat gouda. what did u eat?
2851 2018-09-10 18:16:56 US was busy with the bailouts of banks, housing and auto industry until US Treasuries got downgraded in 2012. US govt was still taking billions of LOSSES in 2014. Any stability came after 2012 when EU hit rock bottom for barely 2 years, then oil crashed in late 2014. 1/2
2852 2018-09-10 18:16:54 Took my truck in for an oil change and I’m gonna end up spending like $600 
2853 2018-09-10 18:16:50 If oil & water doesn't mix then messy & anointed doesn't either!!!
2854 2018-09-10 18:16:41 Give me that oil! NOAW! I invite you to my yacht, I swear.
2855 2018-09-10 18:16:39 I’m happy weed is legal in California and all but somehow someone accidentally added CBD oil to my smoothie this morning.

How did we get here? Is CBD like kale 2.0 now where we just find fucking kale in our smoothies? AND YES THE SMOOTHIE I ORDERED ALSO HAS KALE IN IT SHUT UP
2856 2018-09-10 18:16:39 I doubt whether any tax on fuel is a variable, but just incase it is, its a negative muitiplier that will lower the national GDP.

But in the flip side, it can be an accelerator, if we start exporting crude oil.

Hii tusiargue, i had an award in economics.
2857 2018-09-10 18:16:20 WTF!!   2018,trump released plan to open nearly all federal waters to drilling, And concerns over safety and environmental health  largely been tossed to the wayside, with administration meeting almost exclusively with oil and gas industry when addressing  coastal development!!
2858 2018-09-10 18:15:59 There you go! If you do decide to draw me, I shall have you know I have about 5 freckles on my face ;) lol but seriously, how much would you charge for a commission piece? Let’s say a small to medium-sized oil on canvas?
2859 2018-09-10 18:15:50 The real graph also shows the rise in prize of oil in dollars
2860 2018-09-10 18:15:43 Don't worry you can still run around the world committing war crimes because this will never change. Democrat or republican you have something that united you.... Your love for war and oil
2861 2018-09-10 18:15:23 Don't need the weather app...I can just look at the consistency of the jar of coconut oil on my desk and the difference between last week and this week is STAGGERING!!!
2862 2018-09-10 18:15:05 That also does not include 1.44 lakh crore of oil debt bonds issued by UPA govt with interest taking it to abt 2 lakh crore that modi govt had to pay........
2863 2018-09-10 18:15:04 Avacado oil mayo is a game changer
2864 2018-09-10 18:14:57 And may be they are trying to say that in comparison to the 5 years each of the Congress rule the %increase in price of oil is comparatively far far less of the Modi Govt.
2865 2018-09-10 18:14:50 What’s not said about Texas, a large amount is oil and gas related, that @JustinTrudeau is trying to kill.
2866 2018-09-10 18:14:43 Also Imma be late to class today cuz my car leaking oil 
2867 2018-09-10 18:14:29 Imagine we didn't find oil?
2868 2018-09-10 18:14:27 Please find a way to get him some cannabis oil. Doctors who claim that it won’t/can’t help him live better, longer & potentially aid in fighting the disease are lying through their teeth. It helped my mom live not 2 months but 7 and she didn’t die from cancer but pharmaceuticals.
2869 2018-09-10 18:14:27 i like to roast cubed eggplant, onions, carrot, whatever i have on hand, in olive oil, garlic and some spices, and then throw it into a quick crushed tomato sauce. it works as a side, or you can put it over pasta, rice, w/e with some cheese and basil and its a meal
2870 2018-09-10 18:14:21 It's disgusting that just because a country is oil rich, that the rest of the world caters to their barbaric customs.
2871 2018-09-10 18:14:18 accidentally put mint oil under my nose and man i fudged up
2872 2018-09-10 18:14:18 Research CBD oil & THC oil.. it helps with cancer
2873 2018-09-10 18:14:11 You’ll have to ask Lucas Oil...
2874 2018-09-10 18:13:59 Oil bonds worth 2lac crores with interest of 70,000 crores is reimbursed by centre, which was gifted by previous UPA.

2878 2018-09-10 18:13:36 She will never love oil enough for the conservatives to accept her, she could eat it for dinner and they would say you don’t love oil enough.
2879 2018-09-10 18:13:31 You want to rent our lands to oil and mining companies. Going to throw in some logging too? Hands off public lands, @GOP #VoteRepublicansOut
2880 2018-09-10 18:13:26 How about graph price vs crude oil price ??? @AmitShah @narendramodi  how many more years blind bakths going to trust u guys ??

2882 2018-09-10 18:13:12 Jajoba oil is good for scarring!
2883 2018-09-10 18:13:07 Men don’t read any further but ladies I think using an oil based cleanser before a water based one is changing my life in a beautiful way
2884 2018-09-10 18:12:58 You mean rolling back labour changes in the Federal sector you implemented? That you'd have ultimately lost at the SCC, you remember the SCC, you're good friends there that struck down most of your CRAP legislation in favour of corporate and big oil interests
2885 2018-09-10 18:12:51 go ahead and oil your clippers then
2886 2018-09-10 18:12:36 Whom exactly #BharatBandh is against?

Is it against previous UPA govt
that took 2 lakh cr loan on oil bonds & increased petrol from Rs 37 to 78?

Or

Against the man who repaid someone's loan of 2 lakh cr with interest of Rs 70,000cr &
increased petrol cost by juz Rs 5 in 5 yrs

2891 2018-09-10 18:12:12 The transfer of oil & central bank to Cyrenica has become urgent necessity & utmost importance to keep Libyans ' livelihoods & money from futility of militias in Tripoli. Beni Ghazi is headqrtrs of Oil Corp,  central bank & airline & must return to it. Cyrenaica is safe. #Barqah
2892 2018-09-10 18:12:07 a lot cruciferous veggies with organic cold pressed extra virgin olive oil & organic unrefined virgin coconut oil. organic grass-fed beef or wild caught sardines and alaskan sockeye salmon. or organic pasture-raised eggs. toss in some avocados.
2893 2018-09-10 18:11:56 Modi government should use think tanks of great economist of opposition( who did in past) and ruling government to curb the oil prices, rupee and fiscal deficit for betterment of country.
2894 2018-09-10 18:11:19 When I see how Qatar and Saudi Arabia are using their oil money I just sit and ask myself if Kenya is selling coconut oil.

2899 2018-09-10 18:11:02 The answer is obviously yes but when the team is run by snake oil salesmen it probably wouldn’t matter.  Steven is cheap and going to run this team into the ground.

2903 2018-09-10 18:10:12 As for the market deciding it, if we mine coal here, we don't have to purchase as much oil "over there". That's what people are going to see as market-driven. That's why Trump is continuing to campaign on reopening coal mines

2907 2018-09-10 18:09:34 It's a Bolognese that's too long to write on Twitter but my favourite pasta sauce recipe is:

Take a load of fresh grown garden tomatoes.

Pick off as much skin as you can be arsed to
Grab some thyme, sea salt and olive oil
Everything in a blender
2908 2018-09-10 18:09:17 Doomed! Doomed! Doomed!
There'll be no food after Brexit. No sandwiches or French cheese and I'm dreadfully afraid that supplies of olive oil might be interrupted. Then there'll be a sperm shortage.
Doomed. We're all doomed

2914 2018-09-10 18:08:15 “Have the water wars started yet? Or is it still about the oil?”
2915 2018-09-10 18:08:12 Hello Gowda money is used to repay the debt created my Congress govt and  for infrastructure can't you see the speed of development can you answer why Congress govt did not pay oil bond debt of 147000 crores plus interest of 47000 crore what congress did  with that loot
2916 2018-09-10 18:08:05 I’m introducing Jon to self care so last night I put coconut oil all in his hair and twisted it up while we ate hot Cheetos and watched a movie and it was honestly the most relaxing thing ever

We didn’t have gun oil believe it or not, of our own anyways. 

Had to borrow it from the SAW gunners....
2919 2018-09-10 18:08:00 What?  Instead of the Finnish one, you mean?  

(There is a boring answer about EC -> EEC, and oil.  But that's boring)
2920 2018-09-10 18:07:58 theyre really good!!! a lot of chocolate based recipes u can use avocados and it makes them taste more chocolatey and it makes them more moist/smooth too!!! i think u can also use them in place of oil/eggs depending on the recipe!!!!
2921 2018-09-10 18:07:57 Really? I didn't see baby oil spraying  until Cedric and Buddy....
2922 2018-09-10 18:07:55 Does rice crisps fried in rice bran oil and consumed along with a rice bowl of cooked spilt rice affect the con-science? Even science can't explain this !

2924 2018-09-10 18:07:47 I’m in Big Trouble for accidentally pouring hot wax down the sink and blocking the pipe. Not quite as bad as the last time I poured hot oil down it and didn’t realise all pipes are connected and then flooded the house when I opened the washing machine, but still 
2925 2018-09-10 18:07:42 @RachelNotley  
Are we utilizing 100% of our rail car oil capacity?  Seems to me we could be moving more oil by rail cars both east and west.  could help with reducing Albertas debt
2926 2018-09-10 18:07:34 I need bio oil and witch hazel.
2927 2018-09-10 18:07:31 wish i trusted someone to take my car to get an oil change while i'm at work cause i need one asap!
2928 2018-09-10 18:07:07 “We are exporting more than importing. Which means climate change only happens when we import more oil than export because that makes sense.”

2931 2018-09-10 18:06:52 Average Crude oil prices have gone down for last 4 years and still the petrol and diesel prices keep going up.

2932 2018-09-10 18:06:49 Maybe you should add, "only if we get world oil price, otherwise the royalties will be near zero".
2933 2018-09-10 18:06:44 But we better wrap this up quick I need to be at my olive oil company in 26 minutes
2934 2018-09-10 18:06:43 If even a rickshaw driver knows that Manmohan and Sonia left behind a debt of 2 lakh crore through oil bonds and PM Modi is trying to fix the situation, then what hope in hell does Congress have to convince anyone else!
2935 2018-09-10 18:06:41 No I got what you were saying for sure! I just think that the mass production of oils by every company and their mother whether or not the company even specializes in CBD products is kinda weird and also promoting the idea that it’s a magic oil
2936 2018-09-10 18:06:35 The one with crude oil?

2950 2018-09-10 18:04:58 no point in arguing further. i felt under the dynamic leadership of our pm it was a golden chance to have a better situation in kashmir which did not happen. not happy with the way govt dealing oil prices. it seems a golden chance is overall being lost as popularity waning.

2960 2018-09-10 18:04:06 maybe you'll find a way to get @cathmckenna to stop shilling for the oil & gas industry & do her job as Minister of Environment & Climate Change. because climate leaders don't build pipelines  #tarsands #stopkm #undrip #fnpoli #bcpoli #abpoli #cdnpoli #ParisAgreement #climate
2961 2018-09-10 18:04:06 My weed pen broke in my pocket so now I have about 120 mg of oil on my thigh and i’m seriously considering trying to break my back and lick it off
2962 2018-09-10 18:03:59 I don’t want #palmoil workers to be exploited. #Deforestation isn’t my thing, neither is pushing #orangutans to extinction. @RSPOtweets stop certifying @Nestle & @PepsiCo’s palm oil business partner @Indofood

2965 2018-09-10 18:03:38 Stalin at least saved the world from nazis. Americans just kill people for oil so it makes sense to avoid the international courts who btw the rest of the world respects.
2966 2018-09-10 18:03:32 Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak and US Energy Secretary Rick Perry will discuss the introduction of new US sanctions against Iran, construction of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline and development of oil and gas markets on September 13 in Moscow, ~Tass

2968 2018-09-10 18:03:31 Got a cbd oil latte to get me through the morning at work, and the morning has been easier on top of that due to the fact that my boss has been hiding in his office and I haven't said a word to him yet today.

@PMOIndia All u EXPERTS are discussing fuel prices at pumps by NDA govt! Has subsidy 2Oil companies and Payments 2Iran for UPA oil purchases has any bearing on pump prices?? Pl check figures for both DEBTS of gov't &then presnt Price picture, NDA BETTER.

2973 2018-09-10 18:03:06 that’s kinda the conclusion i’ve come to. the other option (according to one of the actual mechanics - not uber helpful single bois) is that it’s a build up of dust and oil crud.
2974 2018-09-10 18:02:55 How about Rs 2 Lakh crore oil bonds? Shall we consider it as scam or it too falls under zero loss theory ?
2975 2018-09-10 18:02:40 from where you get such numbers? Do you even know the state/ center division of OIL taxes? check it first ... you are a real brainless AAPTARD with no logic...
2976 2018-09-10 18:02:34 1.7 lakh crore debt left by UPA in form of oil bills to be handled by NDA

2982 2018-09-10 18:02:24 @PepsiCo @Nestle @Pizza Hut & @TacoBell spend millions on their ‘ethical’ image & say they only use RSPO-certified #palmoil. But truth is @RSPOtweets gives the OK to destructive palm oil by brand @Indofood #savetheorangutans
2983 2018-09-10 18:02:11 Anti-aging hand treatment - soak your hands in milk for 15 mins. Rinse then apply a bit of olive oil on them.
2984 2018-09-10 18:02:08 Very good explanation but 2014 crude oil price 110 Rs. Now only 75 rs. Then why price increase

2992 2018-09-10 18:01:16 Companies saying one thing & doing the other sound familiar? Palm oil industry regulator @RSPOtweets claims to boost ‘ethical’ #palmoil > truth is it certifies exploitation palm oil company @Indofood, @Nestle & @PepsiCo’s business partner

3006 2018-09-10 17:59:51 During NDA regimen between 2009-14 you have looted Rs.4,48,309 Cr. taxpayer's money as subsidy. Besides you take oil bond of Rs 1,30,000 Cr. as loan with intrest.  Till today this fig increased to 2,00,000 Cr. with intrest & Modi govt paying the debt. Don't make the public fool.
3007 2018-09-10 17:59:47 wrong. that’s an old FUD sold by Big Oil and Big Auto. it’s all about the malleability and variability of the power source. there’s a reason why Tesla superchargers will eventually switch to solar energy 
3008 2018-09-10 17:59:45 Why are you assuming that Facebook, Twitter and Google are somehow immovable institutions? We're not dealing with Standard Oil.

3013 2018-09-10 17:59:25 Even the Indian oil corporation supplied fuel in Bhutan is atleast 5rs cheaper.
3014 2018-09-10 17:59:19 Please don't take it seriously, when this person or party is quoting some number. Apart from numbers shared on oil price today, just think what number he said before #Gujrat & #Karnataka election- will win more than 150 seats- you know- what happened?
3015 2018-09-10 17:59:17 Getting my oil changed and my mom calls and asks if i want to go get a pedicure with her ... my heart. Now i dont have to wait for my car to be done either 
3016 2018-09-10 17:59:12 Get used to it, world. The oligarchs of the world, including America, believe you can eat, drink and breathe money so more tax cuts, more coal, more oil, less what your body needs. Enjoy!
3017 2018-09-10 17:59:03 He said we are exporting more oil than importing today. pretty sure he cursed the world

3021 2018-09-10 17:58:46 Dear oil bonds are issued to the oil companies not to oil producing countries. Oil bonds are given by GOI for the loss which oil companies incurred due to subsidy given by the government. And is there a single written proof about these outstandings. Don't believe any spokesperson
3022 2018-09-10 17:58:45 Mujhe gaali dena pasand nahin,  lekin yeh #### majboor karta hai. UPA 1 aur UPA2 ke time main crude oil kitna tha aur 2014 say kitna hai.

3024 2018-09-10 17:58:39 If Pence had any hope of attracting a good portion of the electorate Trump probably would have been dumped long ago. But the '16 primaries made it clear that no one besides Trump can sell any of the party's failing snake oil claims of the past 40 years any longer.
3025 2018-09-10 17:58:24 lol. Religion is not a factor for me though. If you like pour oil in the whole nation when you're done come back and be my partner

3030 2018-09-10 17:57:55 They dislike orange oil.  It won’t get rid of them, but it can limit their activity away from certain areas like pet food areas.  Mint extract is also helpful for creating exclusion zones.
3031 2018-09-10 17:57:52 #BiggBossTamil2 #kamalhassan #vijaytelevision Balaji is not a good person in my opinion and Janani too. Balaji do lot of back biting and make false blame on others. Janani without knowing the correct picture of an issue poring oil on the fire.
3032 2018-09-10 17:57:50 I was referring to the reasons given at the time .. yes they didn't want any of that socialism in any form, the political excuses have always been a cover for protecting the interests of large corporations .. usually oil.
3033 2018-09-10 17:57:49 We are the Lord’s hands.

3039 2018-09-10 17:56:40 Yes but just as important imagine oil rigs out there
3040 2018-09-10 17:56:24 I was talking to a strange man owns an oil trucking company (who thought I was middle eastern bc he was) told me climate change was fake and cited lack of hurricanes as number one example. I’m pretty sure he caused the hurricanes.
3041 2018-09-10 17:56:21 “Canada has purchased the existing Trans Mountain pipeline for $4.5 billion and pledged to complete the expansion project, which would triple the line’s capacity to 890,000 barrels of oil a day”
3042 2018-09-10 17:56:15 Meanwhile taxpayers paid all 150 mill Pence oil co owned in their bankruptcy and now are paying to clean up 200 polluted gas stations they left. 1/4 cleaned at 20 mil cost with more to clean while Pences got to keep their millions.
3043 2018-09-10 17:56:10 @narendramodi Dear PM Modi,
On this issue of oil price rise, Many people are upset and they feel that gov. and its ministers have become arrogant as in UPA 2. Please light us because we believe in you and your leadership.

3047 2018-09-10 17:55:51 I am not sure that if most people actually know the linkage between crude oil prices and petrol prices.... For most people, it is blind faith in their religion and hatred for other religions.

You can be Michael Flatley ...
3049 2018-09-10 17:55:46 Its not ridiculous? Lumping every protester into one group and expecting them to not use any oil products is silly.  Once again, people can be opposed to a pipeline expansion, but still appreciate oil products.  Not sure why thats so hard to grasp

3052 2018-09-10 17:55:31 Yea so that needs to be clear I guess ? Since there are multiple factors affecting the petrol prices. Also, would be nicer to see a graph of petrol prices versus variation in crude oil prices to give the clearest picture

3056 2018-09-10 17:55:23 I love going to get my oil changed and they show me 30 other things wrong with my car and I just have to nod and agree with them because I don't know jack shit about cars or how they work.
3057 2018-09-10 17:55:22 I slept through my work meeting and my appointment to get my oil changed, so yeah, I suck at being a adult.
3058 2018-09-10 17:55:20 I am going to address this high gasoline prices in greater Vancouver. These oil companies have been over charging motorists for the past 15 years.

Bud, I very well understand why 1$ is 72 today and why oil prices are up. But the logic you presented here was baseless.
3063 2018-09-10 17:54:54 we should dance all over them several times just to let it sink in
3064 2018-09-10 17:54:49 I see your point, and there definitely is a vast discrepancy in terms of income and access to efficiency. MA and RI have really good audit programs that provide 0 interest loans for home efficiency, including insulation and conversion from oil heat
3065 2018-09-10 17:54:41 lol deepika looks fresh. bau sabun lepas mandi, or probably bau coconut shampoo. like, modern coconut shampoo not the red dark colour oil one lol.
3066 2018-09-10 17:54:41 When getting cbd oil from a marijuana plant, you have to be in a state that allows medical marijuana. But CBD from the hemp plant is protected by the agricultural act of 2014. So it depends on where your product comes from and where you live. Though there are many changes ahead.
3067 2018-09-10 17:54:32 It was in control of the govt. But then govt had to borrow money by of purchasing oil bonds. Which would have had increased the debt of our country. What are your views mihir??
3068 2018-09-10 17:54:21 had to improvise on breakfast - hashbrowns with no eggs, because they're no longer edible, they're little deathorbs. Low sodium for the @LoialOtter's benefit; I'll have to bear in mind just how much shallots and sunflower oil functionally sweeten the pan. Still tasty!

3074 2018-09-10 17:53:44 JJ what social program do you want to see cut.  You keep whining about the ills of socialism without informing the reader about what social program you would eliminate.

3078 2018-09-10 17:53:07 Agree but such issues are difficult to comprehend for laypeople.Govt paid off oil debt also possibly built up reserves during low global oil price years! Cesses diverted towards social security schemes significantly better implementation..

3081 2018-09-10 17:52:50 The Opposition must Revolt against such Fracking Projects as Water Levels Reduce in the Region.. The Opposition should Throw out the Pvt Oil & Gas Firms Business Owners out of the Country as they are Causing Water Levels to Deplete in the Country by such Fracking Projects.
3082 2018-09-10 17:52:47 We r not defending high petrol prices it just you guys who want to make fun of every thing which is associated with BJP/RSS.

3105 2018-09-10 17:50:12 BJP played it really well... 

Linked petrol price with International crude oil price when prices were on a low so people won't notice, knowing it will rise substantially in future and govt won't be able to control it.

3127 2018-09-10 17:47:52 Modi govt had raised excise duty on petrol by Rs 11.77/litre & on diesel by Rs 13.47/litre in 9 installments between Nov 2014 - Jan 2016 to shore up finances as global oil prices fell

After the rise in crude prices, Excise Duty was cut just once in Oct 2017 by Rs 2/litre
3128 2018-09-10 17:47:51 Whom exactly #BharatBandh is against?

Is it against previous UPA govt
that took 2 lakh cr loan on oil bonds & increased petrol from Rs 37 to 78?

Or

Against the man who repaid someone's loan of 2 lakh cr with interest of Rs 70,000cr &
increased petrol cost by juz Rs 5 in 5 yrs?

3136 2018-09-10 17:47:07 Important aspect. Willing to bet Norway does most of its own refining. To me at least, an interesting historic/international note: for a century a great deal of #Venezuela's oil has been exported crude to be refined in eg. #Aruba and even #Trinidad.

3144 2018-09-10 17:46:01 All my hair fell out after gastric surgery, hairdresser recommended coconut oil (cheap in b and m bargains) to be rubbed into hair and scalp. I think it helped but if not it’s nice to smell like a bounty bar anyway

3152 2018-09-10 17:44:49 Payment was deferred for future govt by UPA by buying fuel from the gulf through Oil Bonds. Like a post dated cheque. Oil bonds add interest -  like on a loan. Outstandings kept rising. Actual bill: 1.3 lakh crores. We had to pay that + 70000crore interest. That's UPA for you.

3223 2018-09-10 17:37:56 I live in Indy Lucas oil is great for lower end racing. Midgets etc etc. IMS should be great for racing. It certainly is amazing for Indy cars. That race is for the past 6 years has been great.  It just isn’t for nascar.
3224 2018-09-10 17:37:52 Would a pipeline explosion next to the Fore River bridge carrying 35k vehicles per day and several oil storage tanks ‘burn itself out?’

3225 2018-09-10 17:37:49 Or just wash your pans and coffee pot straight away...... also don’t use so much oil for frying Salmon(looks like salmon) ruins the fish
3226 2018-09-10 17:37:44 The oil bond route is a dangerous route. If price is very high let ppl plan their travel. We need the tax for executing the budget!!

3230 2018-09-10 17:37:35 I think this is aimed at parents, all the list are nice to have, and I'm assuming the basics like salt, pepper, oil and tinned goods were already on the list
3231 2018-09-10 17:37:35 What you can do then is incorporate the use of aloe Vera gel. It soothes the skin after it's been exposed to the sun to reduce the risk of damage. No oil.
3232 2018-09-10 17:37:30 Does he think oil gets no subsidy or special treatment?

3237 2018-09-10 17:37:08 Big achievement! In a country that is exporting a huge quantity of oil and gaz and are happy with global warming cause it eases oil drilling in polar region! Can’t understand this country! Or may be government and people aren’t in the same page! #FossilFree
3238 2018-09-10 17:37:07 @TexasStandard ok honey. The people want renewable energy and a clean planet. Strip away the billions in tax breaks from oil and proposed free infrastructure to protect Houston from climate change, and see how oil does.

3250 2018-09-10 17:36:10 To criticize your own team is one thing, but to openly trash them is another.  The “fans” who do this are the real trash, and should never be allowed inside Lucas Oil when we start winning again.  #Colts #ColtsNation

3253 2018-09-10 17:35:48 Facts aren't going to win this, because the BJP will respond with something about the due and payable oil bonds. I think they're smart to just focus on the actual price.

3255 2018-09-10 17:35:41 I’m sitting in my math class and somebody in here has the same oil my grandpa wears on and it reminded me of him and wow I miss him a lot

Luckily my injuries were only super fish oil
3257 2018-09-10 17:35:29 and a blouse on a 100 degree day in the middle of oil country. It’s just annoying. I get first impressions are important. I’m meeting a client about filming her wedding today & I will wear something nicer but, there’s just a time and a place and obvious double standard. 
3258 2018-09-10 17:35:27 tires, alignment + i need an oil change
3259 2018-09-10 17:35:20 She buys big bottles of cbd oil online from medical marijuana companies, cuz its classed as medical here... 
With buying the bottles separately, you can choose the cbd:thc ratio.
3260 2018-09-10 17:35:20 Also the Phantom movies looks like it is mostly shot in an oil palm plantation.
3261 2018-09-10 17:35:17 Interesting point about all the latest Obama speeches. How many Coal, Steel, Oil Drlling, auto, and construction workers are actually working today thanks to President Trump who were unemployed under Obama?  Obama is delusional to think he rolled back his own regulations.
3262 2018-09-10 17:35:16 Biotin supplements and coconut oil massages 
3263 2018-09-10 17:35:16 Can you also put out the % increase/decrease in crude oil price per barrel for the same period in the graph? The graph will make more sense then, unless you intentionally want to hide it. 

When do you all want to stop fooling innocent public?
3264 2018-09-10 17:35:11 Now that he's signed SB-100, maybe he can take some other actions such as banning fracking and closing down #AlisoCanyon and other gas/oil sites.

3268 2018-09-10 17:34:34 I don’t want #palmoil workers to be exploited. #Deforestation isn’t my thing, neither is pushing #orangutans to extinction. @RSPOtweets stop certifying @Nestle & @PepsiCo’s palm oil business partner @Indofood

For me, it's the tone of your article

MMS was at helm when global oil prices were all time high.He did his best, the same can't be said for modi with a history of flopped DM and rehtorics and failed promises to showcase.

3280 2018-09-10 17:33:29 Getting an oil change at @carlblackauto and they are playing Blue Tacoma @russelled  SO PROUD! 
3281 2018-09-10 17:33:23 At that time oil was at around 120 $&now it ie 75$ per barrel
3282 2018-09-10 17:33:20 Dip in olive oil  its magic  get it,magic :)
3283 2018-09-10 17:33:12 yes u r true,it was made clear in News 24 prograame viral sach,dat oil companies cudnt pay Iran due to sanctions n money wz lying wid dem nt wid govt.Y nt upa z clearing dis propaganda.
3284 2018-09-10 17:33:09 PM Modi not taking vote fetching decision of reducing oil prices he is thinking about the nation where states are facing floods needing  immediate help, where its arm forces are facing scarcity of necessary weaponry,where oil import is causing huge out flow of foreign exchange.
3285 2018-09-10 17:33:03 Also Mr Sudhir, have followed your calculations cery carefully would like to share why not you have shared the Rate of crude oil in these period, what was the USD exchange rate?
Please acknowledge these pointer as well Mr economist?
Pls dont elaborate??????
3286 2018-09-10 17:33:02 And btw there are lots of people making a killing under Trump. Just different lobbyists. The oil companies, the military, etc.. Bottom line is a trillion dollar deficit. So he's no different than Obama on that, maybe worse.
3287 2018-09-10 17:33:02 What was crude oil price than ? What was central govt levies on crude ? 
What's total amount of additional levies collected and where utilised ?
3288 2018-09-10 17:33:01 Norway doesnt even have that high taxes, but they have a extremely well regulated oil and natural gas sector. If the USA wouldnt give away all their natural resources Louisiana and Texas could have this too (instead of cancer alley and deepwater horizon clean up).
3289 2018-09-10 17:32:57 Washing powder, conditioner, sprinklies, and essence of sunflower oil - or jasmine if you are out of sunflower oil. At a pinch, cheese'n'pickle can substitute for any two of those four. Occasionally.

3291 2018-09-10 17:32:49 Probably not seeing as many people 'Praise' it at least.  His policies forced his hand and either he admitted that his economic policies on oil and gas were  a complete and total failure or he bought a pipeline without doing due diligence
3292 2018-09-10 17:32:45 Because they want it to look like the Democratic National Convention hall?
3293 2018-09-10 17:32:32 Wages are as flaccid as @VP on his wedding night, and the biggest drivers of the blue-collar hiring surge are the rebound in oil prices & the need to rebuild after disasters such as Hurricane Irma--the one @RealDonaldTrump did nothing about except throwing paper towels at people
3294 2018-09-10 17:32:14 Its #sad that we must report today that this #Carey dude has found and has started drinking the.....Idiot Oil.  Really, no fake news about it.
3295 2018-09-10 17:32:14 #Escalante President trump- you could do something about getting us oil free. I hate to have to drill for oil and tear up a national monument since there is only so much oil left or monuments.  You can do this.

3298 2018-09-10 17:31:55 Just because it's legal doesn't mean it's a good or moral thing to do...that's one of the reasons why the oil industry and green industries get billions in subsidies whether their products work or are efficient or not
3299 2018-09-10 17:31:41 Not true. You haven’t studied the accounts of oil marketing companies ... channels also haven’t. See what are oil bonds and how much money was pumped into OMC to keep petrol low.
3300 2018-09-10 17:31:30 Same problem because flu. But I drenched nose in coconut oil and it went away 
3301 2018-09-10 17:31:28 Selling off national monuments to oil and mining is a scandalous way to "fix" infrastructure. Shame on you and all those who support this measure.

3303 2018-09-10 17:31:23 The turbulence in Venezuela and the crooked cum unpredictable Islamic regime of Iran have seen global oil production reduce. Global prices already high
3304 2018-09-10 17:31:20 Issue more oil bonds..which upa did .then we will see where rupee will be..at least they are using taxpayers money for good..pure case of idiot bjp Twitter handler

3306 2018-09-10 17:31:04 As common man is an "idot". It is because govt is bending before US dictations. Govt can purchase oil from Iran at low cost. But under US dictations, it is purchasing it from other Arab countries on higher prices.

3311 2018-09-10 17:30:39 Is this a correct statement.i doubt.when oil prices went down the price was not reduced as this money utilized for the infrastructure devlopment,for the benefit of the poor like insurance,awas yojana,toilet for all etc etc.

3325 2018-09-10 17:29:50 those  are fixed price regime of petrol/diesel
#that means irrespective of international crude price/petrol & diesel price R kept on low price 
# oil companies R started bleeding hence govt bring adjust plan/if crude goes up /fuel goes up if crude comes down then fuel  rate down
3326 2018-09-10 17:29:48 Even if oil prices r high, but still inflation is under control and it is within 4.5%. This is because the rate of gst has been reduced on the essential items.

3329 2018-09-10 17:29:42 Challenging Farage better than boycotting him. Happy to take him on again anytime. Boris, Farage and their pal Trump have this, among other things, in common. They're the 21st century version of the Old West's Snake Oil Salesmen
3330 2018-09-10 17:29:30 @realDonaldTrump Friendly advise. Get Cyprus in NATO. You resolve Greece/Turkey/Cyprus issues, you get oil reserves and an unsinkable aircarrier.

3332 2018-09-10 17:29:24 Understand guys ... Fuel prices is high because of oil bonds given by previous govt. This govts priority is paying back that  which Congress govt dint pay. I understand this govt is harsh but is doing the right thing by not giving any subsidies to common people.

3350 2018-09-10 17:27:25 Do you know why modi govt is not able to reduce oil prices bcoz ur beloved @RahulGandhi congress party has left over thousand of crores rupees as debt to be paid by modi govt.

3357 2018-09-10 17:26:36 It is my understanding that he had put a lot of trade regulations on China. Steel is booming, oil is booming, coal coming back, 

He’s changed everything O killed
3358 2018-09-10 17:26:34 Because the regime can't stop the wells pumping, and they can't make more tanks, so they spill the crude oil on the streets and homes because is cheaper and practical, and inhuman.
3359 2018-09-10 17:26:24 AND products containing palm oil.

3361 2018-09-10 17:26:13 आम्हाला काय मूर्ख समजला काय? UPA व NDA च्या काळात पेट्रोल व डीज़ल वर टैक्स कीती आहेत त्याचे details दया. International level वर crude oil तेंव्हा आणि आता दर कीती होते ते पण सांग़ा? विधानसभेच्या निवडणूका आल्या की rate का वाढ़त नाहीत ते पण सांग़ा.

3364 2018-09-10 17:25:34 Sanjay Jha is giving wrong information about FALL IN PRICE OF CRUDE OIL : Obviously because common man is not going to bother about finding the truth : ACTUALLY Price of Petrol and Diesel has GONE UP THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.

Fat is the highest concentration of energy per gram (more than double protein and carbs). Therefore you don’t need as much volume (easier on the digestion) yet get a lot more energy/fuel to run on.

A spoonful of coconut oil or grass fed butter works! #XeroTips
3372 2018-09-10 17:24:59 Not really. Just fry it using cooking oil..
3373 2018-09-10 17:24:53 @Nigeria Nigeria needs to diversify it's economy in different aspects other than just crude oil. I don't know why the current administration could not sight the huge potentials the country has and utilize it in making the c country great.
3374 2018-09-10 17:24:49 Sir y u didn't mention price of crude oil,yeh sab figure times now ya chee news par dena,waise u r also congressi so u r also gunda kya???@jay_bhadrakali @inclusivemind
3375 2018-09-10 17:24:40 They're frauds and the only way to get elected was to lie about the very reasons they get elected. Not only roe vs wade but Alaskan natives will be stripped of healthcare and their land in favor of oil, gas, and mining!
3376 2018-09-10 17:24:31 Exactly... USA uses the so-called "moderate rebels", which even the Syrian people say is ISIS as they don't recognise them, to keep destabilizing the middle east for USA and partner interest. War brings profit and control. Arms trade, oil, etc. using terrorist groups. People die.

3392 2018-09-10 17:23:45 Only question is, after so much of so called good work done by NDA govt, do we still not have any alternative ways to collect taxes? Or just because it's an easy way to fill your pockets by taxing oil?

3397 2018-09-10 17:23:06 I'm experimenting. Truffle oil seems like a winner and light pesto has worked so far. I'm afraid to use marinara until my stone arrives.
3398 2018-09-10 17:23:02 We've got a bigger chunk of that, but dont believe it's not dwindling. Our rubber industry is held low due to toxins & other stuff in production. Oil/Gas/LNG will be tough to get away from us - we are strong, but the labor force is becoming more & more Hispanic.
3399 2018-09-10 17:23:01 That is damn good. @SuperSamicom has been buying things over several sessions that resulted in the creation of explosive Molotov cocktails, they blew up a Gela. Cube by dosing curtains in oil and shoving them in it and burning the curtain like a fuse, etc. brilliant shit.

3403 2018-09-10 17:22:23 Key takeaways from Rajan: Current acct deficit partly because of oil, partly because our exports ahve slowed due to DeMo, GST. WE need to restore export growth on a war footing. Also ensure good macros like controlled fiscal deficit and low inflation.

3406 2018-09-10 17:22:11 Yes because releasing billions of tons of sequestered carbon that took millions of years to be captured within biomass and converted to oil and coal and released in just a few centuries is the better solution. Cool.

3415 2018-09-10 17:21:00 It of course was a trick question. I rationally went through an explanation that made total sense for extrapolating an answer. His was: I’d call the 5 biggest oil companies and ask how many gas stations they have. Most who left from that early time never have to work again.

3420 2018-09-10 17:20:48 10 lac crores had been collected till 2017, this is the govt figure. When crude oil was cheaper, they increased excise duty multiple times... And let elections come they will lower the taxes then to fool enough Indians to get majority seats.
3421 2018-09-10 17:20:46 Massive Deregulation
Approved two oil pipelines
Tax cuts for most (EVERYBODY, I work with got at least a $50/paycheck raise)

New Trade deals (Mexico, EU/Canada working, China developing)
But, hey, that's nothing....
3422 2018-09-10 17:20:45 Big Oil wants to knock out coal and the world to concentrate power generation etc on gas which it supplies.
3423 2018-09-10 17:20:43 Can i ask you for proof of debt which UPA created and left for modiji on petrol and oil?? Only some amount of iran was left due to ban on Iran but that remaining amount too was deposited in bank by the oil companies. OPEC never supply oil on credit.
3424 2018-09-10 17:20:43 My C B D oil is out for delivery.  I ran out last week and I never do.  A good reminder not to run out ever again.  My burning feet came back
3425 2018-09-10 17:20:39 Why are including crude oil price you duffers
3426 2018-09-10 17:20:35 Why
3427 2018-09-10 17:20:28 Sir @HKRotich Fluctuating global oil prices are enough economic problems for the country. Let's not compound the problems with a homemade VAT challenge whose effect will be negative. The 16% VAT is punitive to say the least. @KenyanTraffic
3428 2018-09-10 17:20:27 That's the plan as of now. You guys? Want to come play games? I have at least a few days worth of lamp oil.

3430 2018-09-10 17:20:13 Because MMS gave a legacy of 2 lac crore Oil Bond 2 be Paid in  with 70,0000 crore Interest 2 NDA . Here is trick - MMS was right when he believed that he won't secure 3rd term as a PM candidate & can splurge as much as on Oil as  he can unlike Modi who is sure to win 2-3-4 terms
3431 2018-09-10 17:20:07 Do you think that public is fool.? IF YOU HAVE GUTS,also post the International crude oil prices.Then we will compare
3432 2018-09-10 17:20:04 You have explained it very well with facts. But, why was rising fuel prices an issue for the BJP in the opposition when it knew Crude oil prices were at an all time high, then it was only about seizing a political opportunity.. what makes it different now.
3433 2018-09-10 17:20:02 #palmoil company @Indofood exploits workers. I want @RSPOtweets to kick the rogue company - and @Nestle & @PepsiCo’s business partner - off its certification scheme & stop supporting exploitation palm oil now! #workersrights

3436 2018-09-10 17:19:27 Whom exactly #BharatBandh is against?

Is it against previous UPA govt
that took 2 lakh cr loan on oil bonds & increased petrol from Rs 37 to 78?

Or

Against the man who repaid someone's loan of 2 lakh cr with interest of Rs 70,000cr &
increased petrol cost by juz Rs 5 in 5 yrs?
3437 2018-09-10 17:19:25 UPA ws selling petrol at Rs 75 when crude oil ws $140. NDA is selling petrol at Rs 89 when crude oil is $40. Can you see where is the cheat?
3438 2018-09-10 17:19:21 A rise in the price of any commodity leads to fall in demand. 

Imported commodities are priced at globally benchmarked index. Why crude oil should be an exception?
3439 2018-09-10 17:19:15 got my oil changed, laundry started, got 1/2 my hw done & got a job interview set up all before 10am today. it’s a good day
3440 2018-09-10 17:19:10 U kept fuel pump price low by issueing oil bond of RS 110000 crore. Modi govt paid whole amount plus interest of 70000 crore. Modi could have done the same now & kept price artificially down. But he thinks more about country than party.
3441 2018-09-10 17:19:09 It’s almost as if the MSM that #woke Joe Walsh loves to defend from trumps twitter tirades has an agenda or something.....

3461 2018-09-10 17:17:46 The premise was that by 2018, Kenya would be a commercial oil producer after discovery in Turkana but this hasn’t been the case, with that, even imposing VAT from local production and refinery won't have punitive damages as prices would have been lower.
3462 2018-09-10 17:17:39 When crude oil was 71$per barrel in 2009 then petrol was at Rs 58 and now again when crude oil is at 71$ per barrel then petrol is at Rs 82.
Why it's so? Will BJP IS going to blame his own policy?
3463 2018-09-10 17:17:36 If taxes are lowered, there will b steep fall in petrol/diesel prices. Which will increase their consumption. India will import more crude oil to meet the demnd. Wasting more dollars. CAD will widen..

And Petrol crisis in India is Result of friendship with America, becoz Modi started buying oil from them,

So, America blocked Iraq .. another source of Import of India.

as America got India as buyer.

3474 2018-09-10 17:16:29 Subsidies don't work that way my friend! UPA created debt on petrol & oil, and postponed payments. Modi first paid off these debts. That led to lesser burden on reserves. So, lesser subsidies. This means less outstanding liabilities. Hence petrol prices couldn't be cut down.

3478 2018-09-10 17:16:19 2lakh crores of money has just been paid back by this government raised thru Oil bonds by former PM 10 years back. The surpluses are being used to repay the debts raised. Bitter pill is better than being dead.
3479 2018-09-10 17:16:17 It’s very complex, may not be possible to comprehend just like that. 
Apart from Crude prices, taxes etc; it’s a major source of revenue for Govt, state as well Centre to take care of all welfare measures, to make sure Oil Cos are not bank corrupt. Now, it’s upto Govt priority
3480 2018-09-10 17:16:04 Typhoon season nga naman. Normal lang na tumaas ang presyo ng bilihin. Dahil sa pagtaas ng oil price sa world market at pagbaba ng halaga ng piso laban sa dolyar, inasahan ko na may epekto rin ito sa presyo ng mga bilihin.

3483 2018-09-10 17:15:46 @LastWeekTonight Trump Said his administration is a well oiled machine. I think it’s time for an oil change.

3492 2018-09-10 17:14:57 @PoppyLegion

I don't know how reliable you are. For a politicians decency is a variable not constant. Our military & intelligence Ops are deployed in the Middle East to butcher Muslims for oil. 

Remember the past dead tomorrow when you've fought for the living today.
3493 2018-09-10 17:14:56 No foreign country will pay my taxes I m not a fool like you first of all. What Modi government promises to people of this country? Once they will come to power the dollar will be less then 35rs per dollar the oil price will decrease to less then 50 rs per litre?? Do u remember?

3495 2018-09-10 17:14:46 Candles in reflective holders and oil lamps.  Get them ready at 3 in the afternoon. Then start on dinner.  Propane cooking supplies. The nights will go a lot smoother.
3496 2018-09-10 17:14:43 Too much oil 
3497 2018-09-10 17:14:29 Pushing these undemocratic changes through at the time of Brexit  is putting oil on the flames.
3498 2018-09-10 17:14:24 Discount on the oil coming??
3499 2018-09-10 17:14:21 I do think the long game of trading liability for a carbon tax (or something) is somewhat appealing, though I’m not sure giving oil companies the right to operate in exchange for a different policy is what activists have in mind.
3500 2018-09-10 17:14:20 What about debts in the form of oil bonds took by UPA
3501 2018-09-10 17:14:20 Yeah in general I try to avoid "smoking oil" situations while cooking duetobegaas apartment
3502 2018-09-10 17:14:16 So the rich become richer. Shorting the pound, gambling on it going tits-up, while salting their fortunes offshore. Look at JRMoron. Opening his nice shiny new hedge fund in Dublin. 
They’re a bunch of crooks and shysters.
And the  bought the oil!

3504 2018-09-10 17:14:15 Your head get oil. Chop knuckle 
3505 2018-09-10 17:14:02 That’s fair. Gaming it out, though, I think there’s a negative feedback loop between shutting down oil production and consumer response to high prices. So I’m skeptical it’ll go far enough to make a big difference.
3506 2018-09-10 17:13:55 Yeah oil has to be smoking hot before you drop the onions. And small batches or they will steam instead of fry
3507 2018-09-10 17:13:52 If anything I smell like weed and coconut oil

3510 2018-09-10 17:13:42 Well oiled machine? It’s a massive oil spill
3511 2018-09-10 17:13:35 On your side with this paaji. No doubt due to gloabal crises, crude oil prices have shot up, but govt. needs to reduce some burden by cutting some taxes. On contrary, not sure if INC would have done anything different if it were in power
3512 2018-09-10 17:13:33 If @realDonaldTrump doesn't work with China and India, should we really bother about Iraq Sanctions? 
@narendramodi Why can't we buy more of Iraqi Crude Oil to lower fuel prices in India?

3516 2018-09-10 17:13:16 Every day twitter throws up a set of new economists battling it out on the crude oil fiasco. Sometimes a very interesting read would be better if people could keep their political biases aside. Includes me at times #meaculpa
3517 2018-09-10 17:13:14 @TeddFlorendo You NEED to go to Marukame Udon on Kuhio Avenue for udon noodles and Tenka Ippin on Kapahulu (across from Side Street Inn) for the black garlic oil ramen. You can blame me for your weight gain later!

I came to US in 2001 when petrol here was 98cents per gallon. It went to $4.50 per gallon in 2007 08. Now it is at 2. 

It is clear that subsidy removed OK but tax hike NOT OK.

3556 2018-09-10 17:09:56 We had oil. Stopped using 5000litres/year and turned to ground source heating. Every £1 spent produces £4 heat. No yearly maintainence. Runs 24/7 go do your research!

3560 2018-09-10 17:09:36 They are indicating that the percentage increase of oil prices has actually decreased percentage wise, in the given period of time.

Stupid they are.
Got tangles up in their own web.
3561 2018-09-10 17:09:36 Listen to these rules - that name calling and insults will lead to oil prices at $100 a barrel.

3597 2018-09-10 17:06:00 Yes , because the UPA had to pay massive level of subsidy to the consumers as the crude oil prices were $143 per barrel, but that is not the case today . Today we are paying heavy taxes that goes into building tallest statues of Sardar Patel.

3630 2018-09-10 17:03:03 A bad attempt at Photoshop. BTW the crude oil price during 2013 was much higher. If it was Modi during that period, petrol price would have been 150.

3636 2018-09-10 17:02:33 The daily newspapers here won't entertain the idea that for example pipeline protesters may have even some points. The conversation is always about how we're failing oil companies. Judging from the pattern, challenging that kind of power puts writers at risk of layoffs.
3637 2018-09-10 17:02:33 Poor lad. I’m sorry there’s the stress of this too. I know you’ve got this in hand, but it’s shit to have to worry about the wee furs like this. Meanwhile, do you have a bit of lavender oil to warm, for soothing? While you’re keeping watch.

3674 2018-09-10 16:59:55 Am not overcrediting BJP sarkar.. overcrediting is a synonym for TDP sarkar...the entire debts to Iran and oil bonds are repaid by collecting excise duty and cess on petroleum products..this is the reason why govt didn't passed the benefit of low crude oil price to people
3675 2018-09-10 16:59:54 The same BJP had protested against fuel hike earlier when they were in opposition, Didn't they know about intnatl instability and crude oil prices then?
We citizens can see all politicians are same irrespective of party.Wrong promises b4 election and right reasons when in power

3713 2018-09-10 16:56:33 Anyone know how to change oil?
3714 2018-09-10 16:56:22 Also- use a moisturiser with carrier oils, to help get all the vitamins and moisture to your hypodermis, so almond oil, coconut, jojoba. Moisturisers with honey water, or anything water will be light and not as nourishing, so not as good for your skin :)

3716 2018-09-10 16:56:14 If you're using breadcrumbs, whizz a couple of slices of gluten free bread up in a food processor, add a bit of melted butter or oil and some mixed herbs and scatter that on top, before you bake.

3729 2018-09-10 16:55:06 There will be no debt as international crude oil prices back in UPA days was $143 per barrel and today it is $73 per barrel. It takes 42 rupees to manufacture 1 litre of petrol, reducing taxes won't incur a debt. They can also bring it under GST to help the common mass.

3738 2018-09-10 16:54:28 Yes I think Ug will eventually. An oil economy requires a very stable and robust banking sector to facilitate large volumes of international trade. By raising the minimum capital, regulators eliminate the weaker players or force them to merge
3739 2018-09-10 16:54:25 #BharatBandh People's antagonism towards the government would never reach it's zenith so long as it seems that money collected from exorbitant taxes levied on oil is being wasted on scams like #commenwealthscam #coalscam during UPA regime.
3740 2018-09-10 16:54:22 @fayedsouza @MirrorNow It appears tht we r paying a larger service fee 2 d seller fr logistics more than d actual product cost. The countries that explore,drill,refine & sell oil run their entire economy with that, whilst we still have IT & GST sucking us dry of whats left of us.
3741 2018-09-10 16:54:21 @DemolaRewaju @OfficialAPCNg during PDP as oil slided downward GDP of Nigeria/Ghana went down1:1 but under APC Ghana went 10:1.5

3743 2018-09-10 16:53:59 That Obama snake oil that he slid into the WH on lost it's lubricating properties
3744 2018-09-10 16:53:54 GDP rising becomes hollow and meaningless if oil prices and free fall of rupee hit citizens over a broad spectrum of economic life.  Time the govt get back to acting as the federal head to discipline the states. If it can't it must exit. @arunjaitley @surjitbhalla @bibekdebroy

3746 2018-09-10 16:53:44 Best oil change experience ever: a woman did it, I wasn’t pressured to get stuff done to my car, AND she recognized my TWLOHA sticker and we talked about WSPD being today.
3747 2018-09-10 16:53:30 Mr President,
If the economy is so good, give workers a raise or tell them why not.

You've made the stock market richer. You've made the rich richer.

Give workers a raise: Coal miners,  oil workers, sales clerks, cooks, teachers, machinists, factory workers, bookkeepers.
3748 2018-09-10 16:53:28 Btw, Last night, Babe, I did notice Bunny and Lioness/Cat totem protectors, with you, in the oil? stains of the parking lot, where you were doing your "first (Rock 'n Roll) yoga class".Keep going! Keep fighting! We got your back and we're with you! # manifesting # dreams :)
3749 2018-09-10 16:53:19 This is a true milestone – not just for Suncor and our joint-venture co-owners, @TeckResources  and @Total , but for the entire oil sands industry, this region, our province, and our country

3754 2018-09-10 16:52:48 I think simply that Omarosa is the ultimate opportunistic snake oil salesman.  She'll go wherever she perceives a gain and ally herself with those she believes can move her ahead regardless if she believes in the mission statement or not.
3755 2018-09-10 16:52:39 Y’all this man in front of me in Walmart buying hella peroxide, Clorox, epsom salt, & corn oil. Idk what the corn oil is for but that shit look like... murder

3759 2018-09-10 16:52:08 Could you please include the crude oil price in international market aswell ?? Or else its just like showing only a numerator with out a denominator. I heard that BJP IT cell has guys from IIMs.. guys haven’t you studied data comparison during MBA ? Be a lil logical.

3767 2018-09-10 16:51:28 BTW, on the new Briggs and Stratton engines, you aren't supposed to change the oil, just add more when needed. Apparently changing the oil causes the engine to blow up.
3768 2018-09-10 16:51:24 So whenever Lucas Oil Raceway is gets finished with renovations, CAN WE PLEASE STOP GOING TO THE BRICKYARD AND GO BACK THERE FOR NASCAR RACES?

3770 2018-09-10 16:51:20 But it's not. If I was protesting Oil pipelines I would show up on my bike, wearing wool, no cellphone, and drinking water out of a bearskin canteen sleeping in a lean-to. No cellphone, no air Jordans, no Oakley sunglasses, and shave with a steel straight razor. #optics

3776 2018-09-10 16:51:00 That is not a substantive remark. I have lost faith in "innovation" because I've sat through 40 yrs of Reaganite/Thatcherite antitrust malpractice that has left us with <5 banks, social media companies, oil companies, record labels, broadcasters, etc etc

3778 2018-09-10 16:50:55 I know for some CBD oil vapes you do need to shake it to keep the oils mixing, so that could be an option. I would just be careful not to burn it.
3779 2018-09-10 16:50:53 I spilled tea tree oil on my dress smh. That stuff smells strong too
3780 2018-09-10 16:50:52 You are the 21st century version of the medicine man touring the West and selling his snake oil poison as a cure for everything.
3781 2018-09-10 16:50:48 CNY has depreciated 10% anyway. So relatively it's not that imported items have become significantly cheaper. On the other hand imported oil inflation will hurt
3782 2018-09-10 16:50:45 Those cameras are used by Irish Revenue to detected home heating oil smugglers, as there are different VAT rates imposed.

3785 2018-09-10 16:50:42 You are making assumptions about me.  Here's the reality.  Until the 1950s, women as a duty of R.S. blessed the sick and those in labor, with anointing of oil. So, any change is policy, not doctrine.  If you think she's not influencing women, you are kidding yourself.

3793 2018-09-10 16:49:40 while i think its dumb, i'd be more skeptical that thats true. It adds a lot of risk. california and colorado could knock us oil production down 10%.

3795 2018-09-10 16:49:32 One thing you can do is legalization I'd cannabis. Cbd oil is legal. Legalize, tax it and by doing so you will save jail bed space (tax money) and you will make tax revenue off the sales. Alcohol does way more damage to your body than cannabis and its legal

3866 2018-09-10 16:44:07 Here's a great tip for you @LFHW_UK, I haven't bought cooking oil in ages now as I use the oil in my sundried tomatoes jar. 
3867 2018-09-10 16:43:53 Your right on the oil part or a pipeline to be more specific. The trans Arab pipeline line from the Arabian peninsula to Europe, blocking Russian oil is no longer in the US interest since we have opened our oil to international markets.
3868 2018-09-10 16:43:52 I’ve been needing an oil change for like the past 2 weeks and I was waiting for this person that kept telling me “tomorrow I promise” well I texted someone else knowing he leaves his shop at 5pm and I’m not off until 5pm and he said he would wait for me to be off
3869 2018-09-10 16:43:45 Oil I agree with, and sanctions came because they tried to play the international market based on oil they couldn't produce. I don't think they should have been sanctioned but I do think they should have realised their economy wasn't sustainable and they would have brought m/debt
3870 2018-09-10 16:43:42 Just read till yeh lo oil....Accha lagega
3871 2018-09-10 16:43:41 What about oil bonds and their interest?
3872 2018-09-10 16:43:40 @dpradhanbjp pradhan sahab if u cant control oil prices and if price regulation is not under gov control why dont u give resign and let me clearlly say this u r one of biggest failure minister of ur gov. Aur gst ki baat kab se kar rahe ho yaad karo sharam karo kuch to
3873 2018-09-10 16:43:37 My most relaxing meal to make (just try to ignore the rapidly draining olive oil bottle as you do it...). Obligatory 
3874 2018-09-10 16:43:37 How are you helping ANYBODY by showing disrespect for the flag & anthem? How does it help black people? How does it help ANYBODY? You are a bigger scam than Bernie Madoff! You are a snake oil salesman. Why don't you do something worthwhile with your celebrity? You are a FRAUD!
3875 2018-09-10 16:43:34 Next trend Changer might be electronics vehicles but India need adopt this quickly.

To control both pollution and crude oil crisis.....

Make in India need more concentration on this some one like @elonmusk should born in india

3878 2018-09-10 16:43:13 Quick math - as of now crude oil price ~70/bbl, $-72 = ~₹32/ltr. Refining, transport & other costs ₹6-8/ltr. = ~₹40/ltr. Central excise =19.48/ltr = ~50% on current price = ₹60/ltr. Rest state tax. There is import duty & cess as well IIRC.
3879 2018-09-10 16:43:11 ポリマーマシマシだと耐久性(多分スラッジとか)やHTHS粘度に影響しそうな気がします。正直詳しいメカニズムは理解できてませんが、今回データにないHTHS粘度もある程度確保出来るならば、良いオイルでは無いのかと考えています。
3880 2018-09-10 16:43:09 bio oil works a treat!!
3881 2018-09-10 16:43:05 Make recipes like Jamie Oliver is simple just add a litre of olive oil to everything and throw herbs in not place them simples

3887 2018-09-10 16:42:42 Once a week, coconut oil massage, followed by a rinse with chai ka paani with some nimbu squeezed into it. That’s literally all you need.
3888 2018-09-10 16:42:40 As a disabled combat vet who suffers from pain every day of my life I wonder if cannibis oil would be good for me?

3892 2018-09-10 16:42:18 Visiting my dad in Knoxville TN, waiting in line for an oil change @Walmart and saw how nice the guy was being to the customers, especially the elderly. I thanked him, he blushed and said it was the right thing to do. #GiveHimaRaiseWalmart
3893 2018-09-10 16:42:18 Olialia ar oil ?
3894 2018-09-10 16:42:14 Pls give answer to people why #MMS issued nearly two lakh crore bond to petroleum company when crude oil rose to above 100 and petroleum company were nearly bankrupt.
3895 2018-09-10 16:42:00 CBD oil is the new bcaas of the supplement industry
3896 2018-09-10 16:41:59 Peppermint oil on the temples.
3897 2018-09-10 16:41:48 I would recommend starting with a full spectrum CBD oil to start with so you don't have to go through the trouble of mixing on your own. Another thing to keep in mind is that most tinctures and vaporizers use a carrier liquid such as coconut oil, or vegetable glycerine.
3898 2018-09-10 16:41:48 South Korea to cut off all oil imports from Iran 
#Iran #SouthKorea
3899 2018-09-10 16:41:45 It might be it's loose OR the ball bearings where the Motor meets the blades need some "oil" (the circular bit on the inside, it sometimes happens, idk if it'll have bearings tho
3900 2018-09-10 16:41:44 I need me a massage with some oil or some 
3901 2018-09-10 16:41:39 Yes drugs will kill you and marijuana will heal you. My aunt's cancer has been fading away since she been on the CBD oil.
3902 2018-09-10 16:41:35 @narendramodi please sasta kijiye oil. Jald hi...itna karo do aap ki koi soch bhi paye
3903 2018-09-10 16:41:35 Are you sure that I can’t just put some scented oil on my feet and still be good?  Because a very significant portion of my social media feed suggests that it is 150% effective.

3905 2018-09-10 16:41:32 อย่าทำร้ายกันมากเลย.
3906 2018-09-10 16:41:24 Oho... Iran?
Whats the problem then?
Iran and India are allies right?
Also the largest consumer of oil from Iran. We even have good relations by Kabaddi.
3907 2018-09-10 16:41:20 A Cirque du Soleil performance in Washington state ended abruptly when the audience was accidentally sprayed with oil. Unfortunately, I got sprayed with Extra Virgin, so now everyone knows.

3914 2018-09-10 16:41:04 くる気がして、来たには来たが、違うんだ
3915 2018-09-10 16:40:53 If I used extra virgin olive oil as lube for questionable things, would it still be extra virgin
3916 2018-09-10 16:40:40 Eh, not necessarily. I got fooled hard during Harvey, oil went down. lol
3917 2018-09-10 16:40:31 แกน่ะ เอาแต่ที่ตัวเองสบายใจ โดยไม่ได้สนใจความรู้สึกคนอื่นแล้ว ว่าเขาจะรู้สึกยังไงต่อ พอเห็นว่าคนอื่นทุกข์ใจเพราะตัวเองก็ค่อยมาเกลี่ยกล่อม พอคนนั้นโอเค แกก็ไม่สนใจ ทิ้งความรู้สึกคนนั้นไปเลย
3918 2018-09-10 16:40:28 I think one big thing is that they provided a mental 'magic charm' to allow some types of serious regulatory capture to be disrupted (for a time). But there have been big costs to that too: lots of snake oil and con artistry, lots of survivorship bias.

3925 2018-09-10 16:39:56 Can you give me a few examples of your claim? I don’t recall subsidies to oil and gas to the tune of “billions annually”.
3926 2018-09-10 16:39:52 @AmitShah ur gov is failure on aspect of oil prices and ur minister dharmendra pradhan kitne month se GST laa raha oil products pe god knows kaun kisko bewkoof samjh rahah hai

3930 2018-09-10 16:39:28 This means oil prices going up? 
3931 2018-09-10 16:39:20 No no no.. Why are u even asking??! Common!!!

3933 2018-09-10 16:39:13 He should be meeting Jaitley to reduce tax,  not Pradhan. How much more will they squeeze the oil companies?
3934 2018-09-10 16:39:09 I can send you verified product link, all natural  organic full spectrum CBD oil. They offer a 30 day $$ back guarantee too, so it's essentially no risk I use it personally
3935 2018-09-10 16:39:02 Sab oil varwa kar gari chad rahe hai..aap ke jaise vikh nahi maan rahe hai
3936 2018-09-10 16:38:54 I never blamed Trump. Presidents have been (Handled) since well before JFK and what I could tell you about the Deep State could get me killed. Most former Officers are listed as potential targets so that's nothing new. Syria is about Oil...again and the dollar going bust.

3943 2018-09-10 16:38:43 Grats @Halfords_uk I escaped your Blackburn store without a single iota of mansplaining or patronising & happy with my dot 4 oil (which I was waiting for someone to ask if I was sure was the right product but no one did) YAY full points will shop with you again.
3944 2018-09-10 16:38:40 @VerkerkRob hi Rob, it was great talking to you at the Vitality Expo. You mentioned that certain fish oil brands contains many heavy metals. I would like to look into this further, would you be able to provide a source for this? Thanks
3945 2018-09-10 16:38:38 If we wait until we're UNABLE I think most of us will be dead. Right now, oil is more costly w/externalities built in. We are close to parity. But every year, so much money is made they are trying to delay. Maybe ALL of this is a delay tactic. I've wondered.
3946 2018-09-10 16:38:34 even a rickshaw driver knows that Manmohan and Sonia left behind a debt of 2 lakh crore through oil bonds and PM Modi is trying to fix the situation. Pappu ki team bhi uske jaisi hai - Pappu.
3947 2018-09-10 16:38:31 Did you try cannabis oil,it's natural and works in most cases
3948 2018-09-10 16:38:06 @GenDunford I respect and trust Senator Black, he is a true patriot. Protect us from British war propaganda. NO MORE WARS FOR OIL. Bring our troops home now. BRITISH GOVERNMENT IS THE TERRORIST ALONG WITH US DEEP STATE OPERATIVES.

3960 2018-09-10 16:36:51 What the economist PM Manmohan Singh said & did on petroleum prices? He said that money does not grow on trees & left unpaid bills of oil bonds worth Rs. 1.3 lakh crore. Modi govt paid off the pending bills with interest because 'we should not burden our children'. #NationFirst

3972 2018-09-10 16:36:02 Coconut oil always helps me but it’s not a permanent solution
3973 2018-09-10 16:35:47 Planning to poori hai bhai. Oil companies ko bond issue kar denge as subsidies 
3974 2018-09-10 16:35:43 Which one? My personal favorite is the one where the guy who manages an oil fund was on here smearing $TSLA. The one where a bunch of shorts harassed an auto reviewer into deleting his Twitter account, because they didn't like his M3 review, is a close second.
3975 2018-09-10 16:35:35 I'd like the whole situation rolled back, but once we're unable to use oil, a lot will change.
3976 2018-09-10 16:35:31 @rsprasad if these peoples are so helpless kindly resign from the government. Btw what about your oppose when crude oil price was more than $150/barrel.
3977 2018-09-10 16:35:26 Well, he might have called it The Mueller Man, but that title's too close to one that already focused on a snake oil salesman, The Music Man. So, go with something new, The Russians Are Coming, the Musical.

@ImranKhanPTI 
Focus on oil reserves near Iran border as well bcoz if u success there pak will be in top ten countries of oil
3981 2018-09-10 16:35:19 Time to go and check that all the shares of RU oil conglomerate Rosneft have been distributed to the proper Cyprus Bank accounts and holding companies for @POTUS
3982 2018-09-10 16:35:15 @tiger_oil yo go to this
3983 2018-09-10 16:35:14 The US supported and still support middle east dictators whatever human rights violations they do if they guard the Israeli occupation and oil fields. 
It is stupid to think that the US cares about the human rights in our area.
3984 2018-09-10 16:35:08 They think of saving our air quality. How down right stupid of them to think such left leaning, ultra-liberal thoughts. Clean Air...Hogwash. They are willing to bankrupt billion dollar oil companies, for clean air. Next they'll want to ban the dumping of coal sludge into rivers.
3985 2018-09-10 16:35:08 Please tell us why oil prices low in Congress govt even if oil prices are high in international market?
3986 2018-09-10 16:35:05 Looool ggguyyyyy no single drop of oil dey your head
3987 2018-09-10 16:34:55 I vape cbd oil for health reasons but I’d never sit doing it in a pub where people are eating etc
3988 2018-09-10 16:34:49 this comparison is useless untill crude oil price is not being considered .

and their target audiance is andbhakt so graph upar jaaye ya neechey . unhey to modi modi hi karna hai 
3989 2018-09-10 16:34:32 In mixing CBD oil for sub-lingual & vape I've used an isolate powder, & now am considering an RSO .3% THC. Reason is for the full spectrum benefit. I'm also adding terpenes (carefully) to customize for me. 
Will I encounter any issues with the viscosity of the RSO? Advice?
3990 2018-09-10 16:34:30 เบสไงง
3991 2018-09-10 16:34:15 เดี๋ยวจะขายบ้างอิๆ
3992 2018-09-10 16:34:11 A lot of the tangling is caused by static. Combine this with (if you can find it) some oil sheen spray and it’ll help a lot! Also weirdly enough, detangling with fingers in cotton gloves works REALLY WELL for some reason?
3993 2018-09-10 16:34:11 but they are not justify the oil rate and the    stuff less government.
3994 2018-09-10 16:34:00 How to refresh a mattress? Add a few drops of essential oil to baking soda, mix, sprinkle on, and one hour later, vacuum off.

3996 2018-09-10 16:33:56 Vermutlich hast du recht. Hoffentlich erwischen wir nächstes Jahr wieder einen guten Draft und auch ein paar gute Free Agents, dann kann man auf mehr hoffen. Am wichtigsten wird für mich ein Sieg gegen die Bills sein, da werde ich Vorort im Lucas Oil Stadium sein.
3997 2018-09-10 16:33:48 Why do they have so many Russia trips? I never hear any follow up on what they talked about or accomplished.
Is Perry working on that 1/2 trillion dollar oil agreement the sanctions mucked up?
3998 2018-09-10 16:33:46 Absolutely, being smart n taking his oil 2 while advising him to expand.
3999 2018-09-10 16:33:44 You have to moisturise, or your oil glands will go into overdrive. Water-based or gel moisturisers are best for oily skin, like the Clinique Dramatically Different. I’ve been using the Rustic Art Neem-Aloe Vera gel and that’s excellent, but I usually have dry skin. Try and see?
4000 2018-09-10 16:33:42 The increase of crude oil prices plus the depreciation of rupee is bound to have impact on margins given that raw material costs around 60% of their expense.. could be one of the main reasons for stock underperformance, but definitely one of the good company worth owing...
4001 2018-09-10 16:33:31 That ambassador was a ding dang spook. He was talking about making money. We just took out Qaddafi at the cost of no one. To say trillions in oil and interests around that is not worth 4 fools?

4021 2018-09-10 16:31:40 stop to make fool ppl ,Gov is paying the debt and interest of oil bonds which UPA had been issued to oil companies to control the fuel prize when crude oil was at $140

4027 2018-09-10 16:30:54 usa policy makes the arab world angry and radicalizes them. We should be phasing out oil and not need to buy any, but what we want we should just pay a fair price for.  Domestically, too, the desire to take advantage of people leads to radicalization and enemies become determined
4028 2018-09-10 16:30:54 Then we see a gradual decrease as natural declines from vintage production on ‘new wells’ drilled 3-5+ years ago affect the ‘new wells’ category. This chart might be helpful if you continuously rolled ‘new wells’ forward to actually reflect newer vintage wells
4029 2018-09-10 16:30:37 Check his autobiography, I guess you know he was one time Chief Auditor at a big oil firm in this country? Also ask GEJ how much he paid him for selling Ribadu candidacy to him. LOL

4031 2018-09-10 16:30:31 There is a logic i don't fathom well. This bill on petroleum product was first postponed in 2013, 2016 and now has taken effect in 2018. During those time we had not started extracting our own oil.the government should balance the price by reducing quantity of imported oil

4046 2018-09-10 16:28:46 Dude.. Just because oil is touching 80 Rs doesn't mean govt has failed. You can't look at one number in isolation. BJP too was wrong to do it in 2014. There is whole economics behind it. Least of all the payment of oil bonds made by the govt. Read up. Be logical. Don't be a fool

4049 2018-09-10 16:28:40 So it would make sense to get a big boost beginning in 2013, when oil prod. on this chart from ‘new wells’ was only ~1 MMbo/d, as the basin ramped up the initial horizontal plays

After the rise in crude prices, Excise Duty was cut just once in Oct 2017 by Rs 2/litre

4064 2018-09-10 16:27:24 Couple of things dont add up-in 2016 RBI added outstndg oil bonds as eligible for rev repo, and est was 45k cr i.e. < 2lac cr, A LOT less.
Secondly, it appears no one in govt knew of this strategic plan of repayment from 2014- June 2018, when it hit media all at once. Google it
4065 2018-09-10 16:27:23 You're also ignoring Chavez took millions out of poverty. The previous gov was right wing. 

What he did wrong? Using oil as its only funding.

4067 2018-09-10 16:27:19 were Indian oil companies  doing charity by controlling fuel prize at 71 when crude oil was at $140 under UPA rule ????
4068 2018-09-10 16:27:13 Should we include ALL hidden costs? (like CO2 pumped into the atmosphere and military costs to keep the oil flowing out of middle east.  Some say 911 is directly linked to oil as well)

4131 2018-09-10 16:22:20 Owned and Operated by and for the People of Alaska we have to stop the 
game playing with big oil, We get screwed every time. We should start seizing assets for failing to pay taxes to the state. It would be a good investment for us all. WE all get shares and a voice in the Corp.
4132 2018-09-10 16:22:19 Wet means to be covered in or saturated in water or another liquid. Oil and water dont mix. The oil saturates/covers the water, therefore water can be wet.
4133 2018-09-10 16:22:18 On September 10th, the UN Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) released a formal statement that condemns the "cowardly terrorist attack on the National Oil Company," and expresses its deepest condolences to the families of the victims and wishes a speedy recovery to the injured.
4134 2018-09-10 16:22:15 It's a creep mission to eliminate the western Canadian oil industry, and guess what it's working.
The main reason it's working is, nobody seems to have a way to stop the over regulation. I've heard some good remedies but politicians just threaten but don't follow through.
4135 2018-09-10 16:22:14 Cocoanut, raisin , marshmellow and CBD oil. That’s a fruit salad
4136 2018-09-10 16:22:11 This so called “ businessman” does not know the international oil price scenario or what. It’s 78$ per barrel now
4137 2018-09-10 16:22:02 There's been talk about rapeseed oil having a high smoke point but does that make it healthier? A recent study from Australia shows extra virgin olive oil may be the safest oil to fry with as it produces less oxidative by products - a high smoke point did not reflect performance
4138 2018-09-10 16:21:51 States r major gainers of oil price rise,centre share is 9% where as states hv 20 to 40%,centre must display oil price calculation at pumps.

4142 2018-09-10 16:21:31 Congress issued oil bonds worth 1.3 lac crore rupees instead of paying the OMCs and now the NDA is now servicing this debt so that our future is secured. Why doesn't Arnab let this point to b put across by @KanchanGupta and @mrvenkatesh so that ppl get 2 know abt it. #bharatbandh

4150 2018-09-10 16:20:45 i dont think the government Will reduce the taxes on oil
1) the fiscal deficit is already overshooting this 3.5 % than previously estimated. govt will shoot  the stability macro economic parameters on head by doing reducing the taxes.
4151 2018-09-10 16:20:42 I suggest u watch cnbc. They put up the same along with oil prices and the bjp spokesperson had no reply. He went on to claim that whenever there are US elections , oil prices fall and bjp is  therefore waiting for Nov.

4156 2018-09-10 16:20:26 USD grows stronger due to global reasons. INR value reflects lower inflation. Oil prices will fluctuate. Accept it. Don't run to govt for fix.

4158 2018-09-10 16:20:17 The CIA-working for the deep-state, are Trying to take assad's oil; they want a pipeline, but he said NO-so they're determined to start wars there, & remove him. CIA DO NOT Abide by Our Laws-they think they're "ABOVE THE LAW"-but they're an Actual Mafia!
4159 2018-09-10 16:20:12 All these alternatives are less efficient than fossil fuels. We should probably make sure we’re able to continue producing enough energy before doing away with oil all together, or shit is going to get really expensive.

4162 2018-09-10 16:19:59 I'd settle for a wad of duct tape and pocket lint at RT at this point. Could the Giants be running him out there in hopes of compensation? If so, it's a little like taking that car with a oil leak onto the NJTPKE for a test drive. #CheckEngine #TackleFailure
4163 2018-09-10 16:19:55 Agreed and at this point, the Habs weren't going to do any better. Something in and around this kind of return was as good as they would see. Having it drag on throughout the season wasn't a realistic option.

4183 2018-09-10 16:18:11 @DnaZeeNews Crude oil price & Petrol Price analysis
2004 - $48.77(Petrol price Rs 33.00)
2014 - $98.89(Petrol price 71.41)
2016 - $43.74( Petrol price 70.00)
2018 -$71.00( Petrol price 80.00)
In UPA govt always Petrol price less then Crude Oil Price but in BJP govt its opposite.
4184 2018-09-10 16:18:07 Just my opinion, but I would go inland if I were located near the ocean.  Good luck!
4185 2018-09-10 16:18:04 आपके बयान आजकल कुछ  ज़्यादा ही बेवक़ूफ़ी भरे लगते हैं। आप बता सकते हैं UPA सरकार जो oil bonds issue करती थी, उसका क्या हुआ? Tax जो सरकार वसूल कर रही है, राज्य सरकार भी बराबर की हिस्सेदार है। टैक्स का पैसा जनता की भलाई एवं development के लिये ही ख़र्च हो रहा है। फिर बकवास क्यूँ?
4186 2018-09-10 16:17:46 OIL sliding. EMs crashed, industrial metals crashed, OIL and U.S. stocks get hit hard next if Fed continues this path. Then they will have nowhere to hide
4187 2018-09-10 16:17:41 Truth is that you haven't developed other sources of revenue to bolster the economy and you are solely dependent on the oil tax bonanza for the last 52 months. Otherwise how do explain the constant increase in excise duty garnering close to Rs 11 lakh crores fro the common man.
4188 2018-09-10 16:17:40 そういって頂けるとありがたいですね。
VI300オーバー自体はまぁ作れるんですよね。相当にポリマーを使うと思いますが。ただ低粘度オイルとなると増粘の余地が少なく、また基油も超低粘度という事で規格に適合するのは難しいというのがありそうで。ホンダの規格外は250位あるんじゃないですかね。

4195 2018-09-10 16:17:13 There are around 600 new wells per month and they produce gas in bcf/d and oil in mill bbl/d. It is a summary of all new wells in one month (at an annualized rate) and all other existing wells in the basin.

4203 2018-09-10 16:15:55 Why can’t that happen this year?  Oil and rbob can fall 10% in the next month.

4239 2018-09-10 16:13:04 The sad truth is Alberta lost its chance to accumulate oil wealth.  Investment is going away because tar sands is becoming the next coal.

4253 2018-09-10 16:11:46 Babu Saheb who will give 2lac crores debt of oil companies? Why didn't the last govt pay the debt? From where money will come? Don't criticize because you have to ?

4259 2018-09-10 16:11:24 The only economic question is how much money is the oil companies pulling out if Canada?
4260 2018-09-10 16:11:19 .. and pan, Tea, halve use of edible oil..sugar, meat and other non essentials. Save two billion dollars. Too big a cost for freedom? Don't forget lipsticks. Just construction industry can give 5 billion dollars. All we need is nationalism/leadership @AbdulRazaqoffic
4261 2018-09-10 16:11:08 Which part of "crude oil" did you not understand?
4262 2018-09-10 16:11:04 Also that there are so many 'trust' men makes me more curious about each. You typically hear about railroad, oil, and steel barrons, but I had not heard about Sugar, Paper or others....
4263 2018-09-10 16:11:02 In Canada we just rejected a $10 billion oil pipeline over worries about whales and yet Japan, Iceland, Norway and Faroes are hacking them to pieces by the hundreds for pet food and penned salmon food??!!

4265 2018-09-10 16:10:47 I think I read that fishing accounts for something like less than 1% of GDP. Oil should, to any rational person with an understanding of technology, be seen as a dying industry not of the future.

4267 2018-09-10 16:10:40 Whom exactly today’s bandh is against?

1. Is it against previous UPA govt,who took 2 lakhs Cr  loan on account of oil bonds & increased petrol price from ₹37 to ₹78

2. Is it against the state govt who get petrol for ₹54,add ₹28 tax &sell it for ₹82  #BharathBandh
4268 2018-09-10 16:10:29 They are stupid and can make any argument to justify the increase in price. There is no justification for increased price, there is a difference between crude price oil then and now. Taxes are highest than previous Government and even they know that.
4269 2018-09-10 16:10:25 America has plenty of oil but Trump needs to payback the Framers votes with his Agricultural Welfare Ethanol paying back voters at any cost to America if he wants a 2nd Term must give them , GOV does not mandate Beef,Pork or Chicken but the DC Swamp forces you to buy their Gas .

Let China take on the shit-pie of islamism and the expense of shipping security. They’ll be better at it as they have no human rights consideration.

The US is an oil exporter, China an importer... leave them to it!
4281 2018-09-10 16:09:18 Is it beneficial to learn how to change your own oil
4282 2018-09-10 16:09:15 Sir, this is also due to Various state govts increased their VAT to compensate revenue loss from lower oil price.
Blame should go to SG
4283 2018-09-10 16:09:10 He is trying to show that year on year increase in the rate of fuel has come down significantly.
However, the comparison is not with respect to crude oil prices. Basically, they tried all sorts of graphs to find places where the statistics reflected them in good light.

4291 2018-09-10 16:08:35 You're correct, it's a dark reflection of retail. They are just much more efficient at turning humans into machine oil. My friend often says, "There is no ethical consumption under capitalism." Our choices are either buy nothing or minimize suffering by addressing the worst ones.
4292 2018-09-10 16:08:30 And govt of America is not serving the people but they actually are interested in their oil.

4323 2018-09-10 16:06:02 There is an obvious difference. Trump created a gas shortage by dumping the Iran accord, less oil. Gave the rich a tax break but can't pay for it. Result, huge deficit. Created tariffs causing food prices to rise. GDP has been over 4% with Obama, never with Trump. What else?

4329 2018-09-10 16:05:28 So India is debt free country now in last three years govt. earned Rs.15-25 from each litre of fuel sold, it must be used for oil bond settlement bcz it was taken during highest crude oil price, ±$140/barrel. UPA reduced the burden of people by subsidy.

4343 2018-09-10 16:03:57 That's why petrol price is not 100. Govt filled the void in treasury left by con gress with dip in oil prices.
4344 2018-09-10 16:03:55 Actual price of a commodity increase if the inflation is high. If the inflation is low why the prices are raising. What are the global factor you are talking about? Crude oil price is now at moderate level too.

Please don't present fudged data of  oil by seeing only retail prices. What about global reduction in crude oil prices per barrel which went down to under 80$ per barrel from over 100$ and govt kept increasing excise duty. Please be responsible while reporting.
4364 2018-09-10 16:02:19 The stock prices have nothing to do with him. The drip came from a key exec leaving the company. However, the stupid stories about him getting publicity are almost definitely pushed by big oil and/or motor tycoons who hate the disruption in their industries.

4371 2018-09-10 16:01:59 Earlier government bought crude oil from Iran but couldn't pay due to sanctions on them, our companies sold that refined oil to consumers and earned money with profit, so when the time comes to pay back Iran you paid from the money you earlier earned on oil not from pocket.
4372 2018-09-10 16:01:56 Got it.. Not surprising at all that crude graphs are shared.. all political parties do it.. to me, it represents a different point of view..

4379 2018-09-10 16:01:13 Agreed. Our politicians are too easily bought by oil.
4380 2018-09-10 16:01:09 Problem is that James sees it as it is, not through rose-tinted lenses, but in that dreary, foggy, seemingly bottomless pit, called Brexit, which is like an oil exploration hole, which yielded nothing and never will, leaving promises of wealth and fortune in tatters.

4391 2018-09-10 15:59:32 First let me explain what oil bonds are. When Crude Oil prices were at $140+ per barrel, to subsidize and control fuel prices in India, the govt instead of cutting taxes issued Oil Bonds to Oil companies which were to be matured or repayed in 5, 7 or 10 years etc

4398 2018-09-10 15:58:58 Reminds me of the joke....

“After God had created the world it was pointed out to him that putting 80% of the worlds oil in one place would allow a people to dominate the world....

The only difference is I have two new tires...

4411 2018-09-10 15:58:20 No. Violence will not bring down oil prices. It will certainly bring down @INCIndia sympathisers.
4412 2018-09-10 15:58:15 in other words, is the data set of wells constant for ‘existing wells’ vs. ‘new wells’? Because a big relative increase in drilling in the Western part of the Delaware basin, where the wells have much higher gas volumes (but still prolific oil volumes) could explain this
4413 2018-09-10 15:58:11 Canada produces NO meaningful volume of GHG's, less than 2%. We could stop all oil and it makes NO diff. to climate. Canada's  GHGs are high/capita because we produce 3 million Barrels/day of oil for USA. Let them wear the GHG hit.

4422 2018-09-10 15:57:10 Yes. the graph is right in %age terms.
But the messaging is too clever by half.
Also, if you compare global crude prices (during UPA, they nearly touched $150/barrel, while they were mostly around $50/barrel during NDA) & the corresponding taxes on oil, the picture is vastly diff
4423 2018-09-10 15:57:08 For example, free trade is great and the oil must flow, BUT the milk must not flow and needs government protection. And if the oil doesn’t flow, people will lose their faith in investing in Canada; but if a major province tears up a couple billion in climate credits, that’s fine.

4469 2018-09-10 15:53:00 I don’t. The point is no government , Congress or BJP has been able to do anything with the increase. Right now crude oil is at a all time low. That is why the percentage is low. In fact in all other countries gas is at low prices. Like I said India can not control the prices

4486 2018-09-10 15:51:23 Looks like,u r a blind follower.

UPA was taking Rs.9 tax on petrol & that time crude oil was $110 per barrel. That is why people has chosen BJP.

Now BJP govt is taking Rs.19 on petrol & the crude oil was $26 to $78 in last 4 years.

Correct me if my comparison is wrong.
4487 2018-09-10 15:51:22 Even on the day of Bandh against incessant rise of oil prices the prices of petrol and diesal hiked surprisingly 
The centre's excuse that the prices of oil prices hike depends on global control .But the centre can cut the prices by excise and cess reductions as is done in AP

4499 2018-09-10 15:51:00 Promised myself I wouldn’t get any more oil till I’m done with the flowers I have.
It’s been a few days and I’m already lurking for a new one.

4504 2018-09-10 15:50:33 Mass migration is already underway, as oil runs out we're going to see a lot more of it (scarcity of chemical fertiliser will send food prices through the roof). We can potentially manage those things. What we can't withstand is socialism destroying people's willingness to work
4505 2018-09-10 15:50:29 He is how men like him make it to the top of the food chain...just like NRA, Oil/Gas, Pharma Cartels..Nothing stands in their way...!
4506 2018-09-10 15:50:26 It's sort of weird that Midnight Oil's song, Beds are Burning, is one of my earliest pop music memories but it's also about making reparations to the indigenous peoples of Australia whose culture and civilisation were nearly entirely destroyed by violent colonisers.
4507 2018-09-10 15:50:22 The USA is home for you, wish for you peace & love. Opinion is your own. 

Facts.
US foreign policy is built on crimes against humanity, began the 21st century with mass slaughter of people in lands of oil. US politics is not about peace & love. It is about money, power & death.
4508 2018-09-10 15:50:14 Cool! Alas, the midnight oil I burned memorizing it as a planet won't be wasted after all. Bring it back! :-)
4509 2018-09-10 15:50:11 Russia's economy ranked as the 12th largest in the world last year, according to the IMF. That means Russia's economy is smaller than Italy's, Canada's and South Korea's. Moreover, #Russia has a one-dimensional economy that relies disproportionately on crude oil.

4513 2018-09-10 15:50:06 The reality here is Westminster has taken 92% of scots oil revenues for 50 years and still managed to near bankrupt the UK.
Scots can do better and deserve better.
Unionists are happy to give wealth away to be in UK
52% and rising are NOT
4514 2018-09-10 15:50:04 It is unknown if the Ratooey ever actually visited the ruins on his quest for oil.

4517 2018-09-10 15:49:52 As I said, at this stage it was the best they were going to do. By the sounds of it, Suzuki sounds as if he'll be a winger and not a centre at the NHL level. Also, wouldn't be so quick to right-off Pacioretty. Natural goal scorers are still difficult to find in today's game.

4530 2018-09-10 15:48:42 there are powerful technologically advanced nations in this world that have spent decades worrying abt d question how 2 replace this  ' input to things we want'. And yet, as d current trend in oil prices shows they have nt succeeded. We dont even have a thinking process in place
4531 2018-09-10 15:48:41 The idea that the London bubble will go on the rampage! Rioters breaking to Waitrose to grab a sea salt and cracked pepper ciabatta with rosemary, some ham and truffle oil. Righto...

4542 2018-09-10 15:47:47 My point would be that it must take much more than a kilo of oil to make a kilo of Lego, but if you compare it to a kilo of petrol, the Lego will last for about 50 years, not 50 minutes :)
4543 2018-09-10 15:47:46 #BahutHuiMehengayiKiMaarAurNahinModiSarkar @ShashiTharoor Sir you also joined the bandwagon of cheap politician? Central& state govts are equally guilty. Both have high stake on oil revenue. Competitive freebies are at the root. Why INC govts not reducing oil vat? @INCIndia
4544 2018-09-10 15:47:44 Oil bond were issued for 23000 cr. & repayment in 2023 when interest is due .
4545 2018-09-10 15:47:42 Quebec will start to develop there oil and gas... receiving too much backlash over Alberta transfer payments. Unfair to Alberta
4546 2018-09-10 15:47:34 Ok let's talk abt %..so this graph suggest that until 75% of 71.41is not crossed we should not utter a word abt rising petrol price.This comes around 125 RS per liter.great..also ,convinantly, just don't talk abt Crude oil prices..
Sorry Not everyone is BHAKT here

4552 2018-09-10 15:46:58 Went to get an oil change. Of course they call me saying I need more shit.

4559 2018-09-10 15:46:29 Socialism has to do with collectivism!  If the government isn’t nationalizing the means of production, it isn’t socialism.  Venezuela failed because Chavez placed the oil industry under government ownership!  Because a nation has a large social welfare state doesn’t make it
4560 2018-09-10 15:46:28 @arunjaitley Repeatedly in almost all TV debates opposition parties question the Govt. about 12 lakh crores saved by the Govt. during the slump in oil prices which is not being effectively countered by the BJP . The Govt. should come out with a break up figure for the amount.
4561 2018-09-10 15:46:25 What is engine oil?

Engine, or motor, oil is designed to lubricate the inner components of internal combustion engines, as well as to protect them against corrosion and keep them cool while in use.

4582 2018-09-10 15:45:08 Govt can lower tax on fuel but they do not want to as they will have to reduce spending.
The oil bonds excuse is just an excuse as it stands paid already.
I think they are not lowering fuel prices as other inflation is in check and fuel costs are not causing overall mehngai.
4583 2018-09-10 15:44:50 Attention CNN & MSNBC where is the countdown of days gone by with out briefing in the BANNER.  I remember you all keep it going when the oil spill in Louisiana under President Obama,  EQUAL ATTENTION

4587 2018-09-10 15:44:37 Damn good pc. 

Amazon flipped a switch overnight retail became saturated. 

Oil. Prices go up ppl pull back then they go down. 
Retail space. Becomes vacant, rent goes down ppl wade back in. 

Slow death of some while others adapt and overcome. New ideas formats enter. Fluid.
4588 2018-09-10 15:44:35 Now, if they mean to say that their regime has done a good job of keeping fuel prices in check, then of course they have the obligation to show it right next to crude oil price, which impacts fuel price directly. 
Why has fuel price risen 13% when crude oil price is down 34%?
4589 2018-09-10 15:44:35 @AmitShah sir, pl arrange to bring price of petroleum products under control. Let oil companies accumulate under recovery for future. Pl take urgent action.
4590 2018-09-10 15:44:24 I've dialed back the simple carbs. I aim for salmon, chicken, turkey, avocado, and green vegetables. I don't do margarine; I use olive oil and avocado oil. I do exercise a lot, but that's b/c I'm training for an Ironman. Otherwise ~ 5 hrs per wk. That keeps my HDL/Total good.

When #BJP came to power, oil was at $40 a barrel. Did he not have control then? Y was excise duty on petrol increased frm Rs 9.2 to 19.4? 

What has the govt done with Rs 11 lakhcr of excise duty?

4607 2018-09-10 15:43:25 And I understand this graph depicts the rate of change in price I pay but you know how twisted it is when you don't factor in Crude oil prices. You know the answer. Just be honest to yourself. Don't need to convince me. I voted for Pm Modiji in 2014. I just want Honesty.
4608 2018-09-10 15:43:22 today is a great day .... oil change, car wash, filled my tank ....

4627 2018-09-10 15:41:49 But still we are having current account deficit. While agree with you on this if the money had been spent yo spur growth and to repay legacy oil bonds then we have to consider them.
4628 2018-09-10 15:41:46 Sir do even know how international commodity markets works? how credit time line is given/works out and how oil bonds work's? Don't mix economics with random political comments to make a point.
4629 2018-09-10 15:41:41 Also Jayadeva for perspective it should show that global crude oil price under UPA was FAR HIGHER than it was ever under NDA
4630 2018-09-10 15:41:38 Govt should control the Oil prices as they did for Vegs and Daal.. Etc. 
And they can do that. #BharatBandh

Petrol Price:Rs 70

Central Excise Duty: 3.92

Sep 2018:
Petrol Price:Rs 81
Intn'l Crude Oil:$76

4636 2018-09-10 15:41:25 International oil price was 104$ in 2014 and now it is 74$ then why is it higer, was  petrol 74 in 2014 then why 86 now
4637 2018-09-10 15:41:20 Still an oil coup
4638 2018-09-10 15:41:08 I should of stood home today .. But the way my car is set up its needs an oil change right by my job lol
4639 2018-09-10 15:41:07 Please compare this with crude oil prices
4640 2018-09-10 15:41:07 try some baby oil
4641 2018-09-10 15:41:06 The bjp govt is responsible for this bloody violence today during bharat bandh.  No bandh  would have called if the oil hike would have controlled by this failed bjp govt.#BharatBandh

4644 2018-09-10 15:40:58 This started as and still is an oil coup
4645 2018-09-10 15:40:51 Indeed....
All that oil money and yet still barbaric backward and primitve 
4646 2018-09-10 15:40:49 But you are missing that UPA 2 had borrowed OIL BOND worth Rs 1.44 Lakh crores which current dispensation had paid back with as interest of Rs 70000 crore extra which made it to Rs 2 Lakh crore.. from where will that Rs 2 lakh crore come? So basically Congress fooled us
4647 2018-09-10 15:40:47 This is well written propaganda and based on thin news articles. Any factual data on field names designed to make you think the analysis is sound.

The oil and gas UK is a better reference. The presence of hydrocarbons is worthless if it cannot be extracted economically.
4648 2018-09-10 15:40:47 Why the fuck are oil changes so expensive for my car dawg
4649 2018-09-10 15:40:43 hangtud kron gaka lasahan pa nako ang oil, kapila na kha to nila ge balik2(?) ngano in.ani mn ka bidli? di nko jud.
4650 2018-09-10 15:40:20 There’s this oil that starts with an m that helps with severe itching or burning on the scalp but I can never remember the name so it’s like zero help
4651 2018-09-10 15:40:18 What's wrong in it. Indian doesn't have nation character. They need to absorb the oil prices as whole world is doing right now.

4653 2018-09-10 15:40:11 Some people don’t like the oil/grease
4654 2018-09-10 15:40:02 With respect,crude oil 109$ in may 2014. It went down till 25-30$ in this govt. Now,it's at 77$. Sir, don't answer me.Ask yourself is this correct way or say clearly, we will keep increasing taxes&this is what we're doing ,people will understand.But, you can't show development.
4655 2018-09-10 15:39:56 oil to remember.
4656 2018-09-10 15:39:48  see try goat meat and peppered   stew with plenty oil and spaghetti by the side you will thank me later

4662 2018-09-10 15:39:04 The lecture sparks energy to all the young and beautiful minds of Indian Oil. It also provides lot of motivation and inspiration to demonstrate our energy and passion at full throttle at our workplace. It was simply speechless!

What will they say about the past riches
No wonder they do not want to let it happen
4668 2018-09-10 15:38:21 ftw? You guys left us with lakhs of crores of debt due to oil imports and claim you can handle the economy better?
4669 2018-09-10 15:38:17 Sir ji... AUR ULLU MAAT BANAO... Now India knows about the 1.44 lakh crore OIL BOND as well which current dispensation is paying pack with interest of Rs 70000 crore extra which made it to Rs 2 lakh crore... tell that as well.. not all are brainless PIDIS?
4670 2018-09-10 15:38:15 Course it did, you’re a grownup. Still I’d argue that it’s like knowing a lot about cars - I can change my own oil but I don’t know how to properly maintain a vehicle like someone who’s trained would.
4671 2018-09-10 15:38:13 Kapalpakan nino? Alam mo ba kung ano ang pinagbabasihan ng oil prices?? At kung bakit tumataas at bumababa yun?? Ikaw ang gumising huy!! Mukhang natulog ka lang nung nagdidiscuss prof mo sa Eco
4672 2018-09-10 15:38:08 In my view we went into this whole debacle as a result of a secret meeting VP Dick Cheney had years ago when he and Bush got into office. After that meeting, which was assumed to be about oil preserves left on planet earth, that the US very soon invaded the Middle East.
4673 2018-09-10 15:38:07 
4674 2018-09-10 15:38:00 All I came to do was get a oil change but from the looks of things I should’ve brought a blanket and pillowDAMN!!
4675 2018-09-10 15:37:57 What kind of maths is this ?? 14pc increase shown as decrease . Plus price of crude oil is now less around 60 $ ..
4676 2018-09-10 15:37:44 Mine is pretty basic -- two table spoons of grass-fed butter and a table spoon of MTC oil.  Blend it up and enjoy.
4677 2018-09-10 15:37:42 during UPA2, crude oil was130+ dollars. after modi came into power the crude price went down to 30dollars, but modi ji increased excise duties nonstop. now when the crude is 79dollars, petrol costs more than when the crude was 130, akal aayi kuch?
4678 2018-09-10 15:37:41 Sure! We recommend using our Mink Oil to bring back hard suede!
4679 2018-09-10 15:37:39 How crude oil price per is Rs 20/- per ltr?  Bit puzzled. 

1 barrel =159 ltr.  1 barrel = $ 70 * 70= Rs 4900 per barrel.  Rs 4900/159= Rs 30.8 per ltr. 

Did i missed something?
4680 2018-09-10 15:37:28 Oil company is this is Libya?????
4681 2018-09-10 15:37:13 The Republican Party has plenty of . Once you know this and you know that Russia is a very rich country… All you need to do is follow the money! This is the real scandal!

Omega-3 fatty acids(EPA,DHA,ALA) are the fatty acids that our body needs to run and work and that gives us healthy benefits as we consume them. EPA and DHA are  found in certain types of fish. ALA is found in walnuts, flaxseed(oil), canola oil, and soybean oil

4697 2018-09-10 15:36:07 OMG am really shocked how u aren't able understand a simple logic that govt of india redeemed 2lac cr oil bond and also cleared 45kcr debt with Iran..govt of india by take advantage of low price of international crude leved high excise duty and cleared the debt burden

4702 2018-09-10 15:35:58 New oil is for suckers, like a seasoned wok, good oil needs a little flavor from previous meals. 
I filter and reuse till it starts foaming 
4703 2018-09-10 15:35:56 After 2014 even 80 went on to become less than 70

4712 2018-09-10 15:35:12 What BJP faild to anticipat is that the economy turned volatile due to Iran problem,Venezuela drop in oil production.ModiGovt shd have saved high petrol tax frm 2014 to March,2018 fr such a rainy day.But overspent on infra with no plan!If oil surge continues,BJP in Mess #oilprice
4713 2018-09-10 15:35:12 Unable to understand why Govt can not fix taxes such as ED, dealer commission, VAT in abosulut terms & not % of oil price,  so price increase control. Intentions of milking higher profits with higher oil prices raises doubts on govt intentions. Can govt come clean?
4714 2018-09-10 15:35:08 Not only oil, every products gets costlier with every passing year... we have to compare the percentage... in 2004, petrol was 39.. in 2014 it was 80... So was rice, dal, your shirt, your chaddi.. everything.... and So is petrol..nothing new.. but % hike is much lesser under Modi
4715 2018-09-10 15:35:07 Sir Without information leakage please do raid on any city , any town Petrol pump in India, you will get the said result automatically. Indian oil petrol pump Deeg Adda Goverdhan district Mathura , Indian Oil petrol pump Shahabad District Hardoi. It's a N numbers of list.

4727 2018-09-10 15:34:19 Last week I was in Sri Lanka and the petrol price there in IOC(Indian Oil Corp) bunks is 145LKR. 1INR = 2.3LKR 1DLR=160.6LKR. Looking at this, Petrol & Diesel is very much costlier in India. @sumanthraman @RKRadhakrishn @arvindgunasekar @Ahmedshabbir20

4734 2018-09-10 15:33:50 It is the volume of gas and the volume of oil in an xy chart.
4735 2018-09-10 15:33:45 Why should BJP be apologetic on oil prices and be on defensive. Modi ji must put it straight before the Nation in his special address to Nation. People have faith in him. Also those leaders on whose bandh call vandalism takes place, should be charged  on with vandalism charges

4754 2018-09-10 15:32:17 It's not temporary.
People should get used to the fact that Crude oil is a non-renewable resource & it's price will rise as Oil nations will want to 'make hay while sun shines'.

Investment on clean/alternative energy is necessary & Govt is doing good in that section.
4755 2018-09-10 15:32:14 At least any sane human being now recognizes that anyone protecting his country's oil resources from US/NATO is a war criminal.
4756 2018-09-10 15:32:09 No point in plotting a graph of Petrol Price without considering Crude Oil Price.
4757 2018-09-10 15:32:09 I saw this at camp meeting one night, someone wanted the elders to pray over them. Preacher didn’t have any oil, he had someone bring a dip stick from the parking lot.

4762 2018-09-10 15:31:52 Obama is a shapeshifting reptile and a reptile cannot be an American citizen!  No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
4763 2018-09-10 15:31:48 Every one knows that the rates of crude oil are lower in spite of all the international factors. The  the real cause of the higher rates of petroleum products is the higher rates of taxes.
4764 2018-09-10 15:31:45 #BharatBandh @otvkhabar when crude oil price hits rock bottom, then why? it's the central govt who's the real criminal here. Remember cut down of fuel price was an essential part of BJP's election manifesto then in 2014. But now certainly we feel like we have been betrayed.

4774 2018-09-10 15:30:38 What BJP says:if Yu take price f petrol in May,2014, then the price today s only 13% more .Techncially,BJP right.But fact is tht int.oil price actually fell more than 100% fr 4 yrs&consumers nevr gt benefit.Wish yr Channel do a show.All govts gouge Ind consumers sadly #DeMoflop

4786 2018-09-10 15:30:09 This govt says they have no control over oil prices! How come before Karnataka and Gujrat elections , rates become stagnant for a month? And if they r so worried abt the economic point of view, why did they do  dharnas & criticise MMS when he was trying 2 get oil bill in control?

4799 2018-09-10 15:28:59 Batao bhai log isey justify kar rahe. Even if nos are correct & i leave aside the crude oil price & other external factors still the graph is flawed. It tries to show % change but ended up showing price fluctuations. Multiple variable in the y axis. (Oh... there is no axis).
4800 2018-09-10 15:28:57 How many people started using cycles/public transport instead of bikes scooters cars to reduce demand of crude oil of this country? It is a global crisis because of trade war so it becomes duty of each citizen to serve the nation with sincere heart and soul.
4801 2018-09-10 15:28:55 Well put my exact words...My gut says oil coming out is not up to grade consistently considering the source of oil
4802 2018-09-10 15:28:55 If you’re in the oil and gas business, I strongly recommend staying away from @BankofAmerica .. they shut my account down today. All transactions are rent, operational costs and travel costs. Nothing else.... but, I’m happy to take my money elsewhere

Don’t to you worried when you see the long list of countries which has abundance of hydrocarbon but majority of their people still dependent on aid?
4808 2018-09-10 15:28:36 why don't you mention the Crude oil price and what is the subsidy we provided. Don't spread lie. Did you seen the Video when Petrol is price is 60Rs.

4812 2018-09-10 15:28:22 Venezuela is a commodity reliant economy.  When the price of oil collapsed, so did their poorly managed economy.

Is Turkey socialist? How are they doing? Trump likes Erdogan.
4813 2018-09-10 15:28:16 Understand 
Oil Bonds worth Rs 2 lakh crore settled 

Iran - 6 billion settled 

Hope Price will reduce during election time .....
4814 2018-09-10 15:28:03 What’s benefit to China? 
1/ China's national foreign policy, 
2/ Improve the development of new energy vehicle technology
3/ Reducing China's dependence on oil and 
4/ Help to reduce air pollution.
4815 2018-09-10 15:27:57 Plus us sanctions for iran oil and s400
4816 2018-09-10 15:27:54 This is embarrassing, withdraw this ASAP. Also, please show a similar comparison, indicating petrol price if the Oil Bond burden was not there.
4817 2018-09-10 15:27:51 Thank you Donald Trump! I so fucking appreciate discovering that my home heating oil monthly budget payments have more than doubled for this winter season, and all because oil prices have skyrocketed under your damn greedy administration! Bastards!
4818 2018-09-10 15:27:50 Libya is totally lawless since Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton decided to make another regime change and killed off Muammar Gaddafi and take over the country's oil. Now it is chaos. Same old Saddam scenario.
4819 2018-09-10 15:27:39 Along with Groundhogs Day there should be coconut oil day where once a tub of coconut oil turns solid it means summer is over and it’s autumn forever now.
4820 2018-09-10 15:27:36 And Venezuela’s problems weren’t caused by socialism, they were caused by a complete economic dependence on oil
4821 2018-09-10 15:27:36 I don’t think it’s that bad from a the Canadiens perspective they got a good prospect who is a C which they need and a proven scoring winger plus a 2nd rounder for a guy that is no longer in his prime.
4822 2018-09-10 15:27:28 Height of Excuse.
Modi mathemagic !
I mean what level BJP people are trying to justify hike in petrol price. 

Please anybody inform that price was increased in UPA govt was due to International crude oil prices.. it was 120 $ at that time.
Now its below 70 $ 

4823 2018-09-10 15:27:23 I only do morning - it helps protect skin during the day, your skin should be healing over night. If your moisturizer is oil free it’s grand but it probably isn’t. Our skin is water based for lack of a better word so oil hinders it’s work at night!

4831 2018-09-10 15:26:41 Will chk this out with crude oil prices.. but still it's a different graph, which has price as x axis not % change.. % is just an add-on in this one..

4842 2018-09-10 15:26:07 Man, it's nothing to do with your Shakha knowledge nor with the growth of ₹9 in 4 yrs. The actual truth is the "%" is with respect to the crude oil price. It was high that time, now that price got decreased. Congress & BJP both have nothing do with it. Graph is half truth.
4843 2018-09-10 15:26:00 It's something that not a lot of people think about when doing Lyft and Door Dash. Is that you're adding a lot of extra expenses to your car, gass, oil, tires, quicker end of warranty and other things. A candle that burns at both ends, eh Edd boy?

4846 2018-09-10 15:25:56 Oil markets facing hurricanes, a seasonal drop in oil demand could send prices out of their current range between $65-$70
4847 2018-09-10 15:25:53 You should read up on gender life preferences and intelligence and the bell curve. Few women want to work 16hr six to seven day weeks. That's what it takes. Why don't you sign up for a dangerous job, like an oil rig worker, or a sewer maintainer. Don't hear much complaining there
4848 2018-09-10 15:25:51 Great! 2 of the 3 reasons for the job growth are higher oil prices and recovery from hurricanes Harvey and Irma.

I know this isn’t tasty at all, but it really works (even better than usual medicin). If you cough a lot, then put 3 drops of tea tree oil on a small sugar. Let it melt in your mouth. You can repeat the process every 4 hours (but not more!)
4879 2018-09-10 15:23:46 Seek mental health counseling. Your grip on reality has slipped. Corporate Dems are all Dems who do the bidding of bankers, Wall Street, & the MIC. That bidding involves imperialism, wars for oil, and preserving wealth inequality.

4896 2018-09-10 15:22:21 Sir,what U r say is farrago economics. Twitteratti knows truth behind UPA’s “low” priced P&D. What is so great about selling at less than cost price by borrowing from future? The truth is UPA funded its subsidies through oil bonds& unpaid imports.But why?For nation or for votes?
4897 2018-09-10 15:22:19 Also add the price of Oil bonds

4902 2018-09-10 15:21:52 Nobama in my white house (keep in mind, my house is painted white)!  Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil! Faires used to be real, UNTIL THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT MURDERED THEM ALL!
4903 2018-09-10 15:21:51 You are doing mistake and giving opposition to get united. You are not ready to cut tax from fuel in the name of development but perception among common men is opposition. In election year you should pay subsidy to oil company and after winning election make things right
4904 2018-09-10 15:21:51 @Thalassa Nope. We have no idea what's going on. Much like the fake oil refineries they used to "run" 8 years ago. Good times.

4910 2018-09-10 15:20:55 Delighted to learn that the much hyped “Bharat Bandh” just fizzeled out. People realize that oil prices or Rupee weakening is not politics.
4911 2018-09-10 15:20:46 I think no impact of BHARAT BANDH on petrol & diesel price it is depend on Indian oil company at the time of UPA government it is only achieve political mileage.
4912 2018-09-10 15:20:43 What is missing is removal of subsidy, oil bond, payment of Iran oil.

4915 2018-09-10 15:20:24 I guess you should also point out what the average worldwide spot price for oil per barrel during those times. Coz you know. We don't actually produce oil.

June 2016 - 47.69
August 2018 - 71.08
4916 2018-09-10 15:20:19 Show the data of crude oil too , then it will be the fair comparision
4917 2018-09-10 15:20:18 Do not work for @Interior now. You will sell your soul if you work for Zinke. Most of the workforce focuses on oil&gas leasing, congressional inquiries, court testimony and FOIAs. Management will direct you to lie.

4922 2018-09-10 15:20:07 Oil is an input to the things we want, but is not itself something we want. We must look to substitute those uses with non-oil based approaches.

4925 2018-09-10 15:19:49 No Eliazabeth a pipeline provides jobs because oil is exported.

4951 2018-09-10 15:17:36 Ardha Satya.

What about 75 % fall in crude oil price..

Do these asshole, thinks every Indian is a  Bhakt to believe on this shit theory.
4952 2018-09-10 15:17:35 Unfortunately, David, we are dealing with differences, not distinctions. The amount of middle ground can only be seen with a high powered microscope. This is a political fight to the finish, between those happy with oil from outside of Canada, and those in favour of Canuck Oil.
4953 2018-09-10 15:17:13 Yay thanks! It’s the easiest possible method, it’s just silver plus nuln oil ink
4954 2018-09-10 15:17:07 Key check:
a) had centre not raised excise when oil prices had crashed to 40$, state govmts would have gone bankrupt, as their taxes on petrol/diesel being 30% of total would have less then halved
b) govmt will cut excise, but close to the elections, to be politically correct

4956 2018-09-10 15:17:01 Kelloggs corn flakes are $3.29 against Willards' $3.55 in OK, our cooking oil is more expensive but personally I prefer a local one still... I dont knw if the complains about high prices is of imports only or goods/services in general, prices going up, yet incomes remain stagnant
4957 2018-09-10 15:16:56 disappointing price at the moment though. 
we wont be getting much garden furniture around our pond.

4961 2018-09-10 15:16:22 A realistic graph would have shown the difference between price of 1 barrel oil in dollars vs price of  petrol per litre.
Another could have been, excise duty per litre at various points.

We are dealing with major change upon the crude oil production.Opec won't welcome this step due to a united oprcal. Second, in work field, the KPi will be affected definitely. Hence, mining workers hours are going to be affected too.

5018 2018-09-10 15:11:33 These guys are babbling idiots. Oil and defense companies getting subsidies - REALLY! These industries pay 100's billions in tax, employ 100,000's w/ benefits, supply national security and advance R&D. What did these dipsticks do?
5019 2018-09-10 15:11:29 I think the oil bond graph was better.  We were in debts and prices were up up up.. today there is 0 oil debt. Yes excise is y? Development outlay has improved. Y be on the defensive. Subsidies through ujwala etc etc is happening and benefitting the poor.

The bar for 80.73 is shorter than the bar for 40.62
The time intervals are not equal.
The arrow is pointing downward  to indicate a hike  in price.
The chart conveniently leaves out crude oil prices for these dates.
=> This graph is a misrepresentation.
5029 2018-09-10 15:10:38 40 to 71 sudden increase but 71 to 80 small increase and additional they paid oil band debt of 2 lack core
5030 2018-09-10 15:10:36 Politics is a game played at the extremes. One should not expect BJP to bow down and accept yes oil price is way too much now. One should also not expect Congress to accept it was a mistake to call Bharat Bandh to harass us like this. There is no mid-path in politics.
5031 2018-09-10 15:10:36 Everyone pushing UKOG knows its shit. Still loads of cash made but i couldnt day in day out push an over inflated steaming pile of shit. Cue a picture of a oil tanker going to an oil well wow zzz

5035 2018-09-10 15:10:05 I can hear the panic from the shorts, big oil, and legacy auto from here.
5036 2018-09-10 15:10:02 It doesn’t matter! This started as an oil coup and rick perry is on his way to Russia...the coup is continuing with or without press briefing. They can no longer have them cause the plan is OUT THERE
5037 2018-09-10 15:09:56 Not real sure how anyone can be down on the Pacioretty deal from a Vegas perspective. The overspend on Tatar was already a sunk cost, so the 1st, 2nd & 3rd don't really play into it. Sure they gave up something but if they can contend again, it'll be well worth it. #GoldenKnights
5038 2018-09-10 15:09:52 Use oil
5039 2018-09-10 15:09:47 Somehow the Rosneft deal is alive? And with Tillerson gone, they send another oil man, instead of Pompeo? So how does Pompeo feel about that?

P.S.: Has today's drama had any effect on oil prices?
5050 2018-09-10 15:08:57 @fayedsouza @MirrorNow superb debate... Let the previous Govt answer for the deficit and loot of the tax payer.... A tax paying citizen... The Oil bond the prv Govt did.... And the loot of Cong... Pls don't be biased to Cong

5057 2018-09-10 15:08:43 The higher price of steel will also impact the construction industry, which uses the material for beams, and the oil and utility industries, which rely on steel pipelines to build the energy infrastructure that serves American consumers.

OIL 1H moves lower on profit taking, SCO 2x bear, price action much better than DWT.

5064 2018-09-10 15:08:12 Despite being a bjp follower , I feel Modi is risking 2019 by not rolling down the excise duties which were hiked when the oil prices crashed. If govts can fall due to rise in onion prices an increase in oil prices would definitely lead to rise in inflation.
5065 2018-09-10 15:08:11 Just had a bhakt in a football whatsapp group defend the current oil price hikes. Seriously? Fuckin oil price hikes too?!? #OilShock

5071 2018-09-10 15:07:48 Taxes aren’t used just to collect revenue, it’s also a means of deterring excess usage, india doesn’t produce oil, it’s imported !! More cars have been sold in the last 4 years causing pollution and congestion issues in cities. Central London has a tax on vehicles entering !!
5072 2018-09-10 15:07:45 Made a bag of the #PictsweetFarms brussel sprouts, butternut squash & onions. It was very easy to make and took only about 20mins. Only prep was adding oil and seasonings. If you're cooking for a family and short on time, tasty tasty! #GotItFree #LetsRoast #RoastEmUp

5082 2018-09-10 15:07:09 Telugu Prajala Atma Gowram is the agenda of NTR TDP.  There is no change inthe ideology of Congress. It remain the same. The change is in the stand of TDP. GST strength-ed the federal nature of the country. The reduction of oil prices in AP is a pointer this.

2. UPA created a debt of 2 lacs on d oil companies during their rule that nw ppl hv to pay.

Congress stabbed ppl frm both sides.

3. Sir, kindly reduce VAT in Karnataka.
5108 2018-09-10 15:04:39 Now that 2lac cr of OIL Bonds have been paid down, where is the need to keep oil at this level still?

5112 2018-09-10 15:03:50 Its substantively a lie. Oil prices between 08-14 were very high. Before 08 and after 14 they've dropped. So, 08-14 Govt. borrowed money to subsidize and stabilize retail price to inflation. Since 14 Govt. has used low prices to pay off the borrowing. Its just standard policy.

5119 2018-09-10 15:02:49 Honest question. I’m wondering if it wouldn’t make more sense to refine the oil closer to source and then ship out the refined product via pipeline? It would mean more full-time jobs in AB and SK.

5130 2018-09-10 15:02:04 Yeah means you only about a quarter of the way through your life. Assuming you do regularly scheduled oil changes and don't abuse your clutch... or is that cars? Still, same rules I'm pretty sure.
5131 2018-09-10 15:02:03 Fast Fact: A single quart of motor oil that seeps into groundwater can pollute 250,000 gallons of drinking water. Dispose of your waste properly!

5169 2018-09-10 14:58:14 Iran offering crude oil trade with indian currency!!  Still why we are trading in dollar??  May be we are controlled by US.
5170 2018-09-10 14:58:13 Harsha, what you said and what @dhaval241086 said are very different. Your article correctly showed us how global oil prices, petrol prices in India and fiscal deficit are related.

This idiot made some stupid 6th class graph that only misleads and thinks he is very smart.
5171 2018-09-10 14:58:00 Honest question - does Norway refine the majority of the oil it extracts and then exports? Or do they just extract and export?
5172 2018-09-10 14:57:56 ですなー！エンディングだったかな…。

Nepal buys oil from us and there oil is cheaper than ours???

5179 2018-09-10 14:57:30 Crude oil price 2004-36$ 2014-96$. 2.7 times increased.Petrol prize doubled. Now crude oil prize is 69$. So today petrol prize must reduced to 40rs. But it increased 8rs?????
5180 2018-09-10 14:57:23 Dear @BJP4India, your communication strategy is directionless. Come on, it's time to talk. Let the truth come out on
1. Oil Bonds
2. Rafale Deal
3. White Paper on Economy left by Economist PM..
It is a must if you need 330+ again. @AmitShah
5181 2018-09-10 14:57:17 Will you enlighten us about the oil pool deficit of rs two lakh carrore presented by the UPA govt to the current NDA govt
5182 2018-09-10 14:57:16 I’ve finally started using beard oil. I’m one of those “gives a crap about how they look guys”. Now to eat ten hot dogs.
5183 2018-09-10 14:57:14 Canola oil has to be the best rebranding ever. Pretty sure people wouldn't be as thrilled cooking with 100% Rape oil.
5184 2018-09-10 14:57:06 @rsprasad If oil Prise hike not in your control then what r u doing in government?
When you were in opposition, always keep blam that govt failed to control oil Prise. what happened now? Why u not use those tools to control price hike? Were u telling lie that time? @PMOIndia
5185 2018-09-10 14:57:05 Low oil prices will favor President Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans in congressional elections due in November. 

So an attempt will be made to push production higher in the wake of #Iran #Sanctions.

5196 2018-09-10 14:56:02 Thing is, I really don't think there ever was such a historic equilibrium (historical transformations are far too contingent, dialectical, etc) - and a "return" is impossible given climate change, the rise of oil as the fuel of world, and the unprecedented hegemony of US...
5197 2018-09-10 14:55:58 Despite a significant reduction in global crude oil prices, Modi govt has failed to pass the benefit to the people of India.

5203 2018-09-10 14:55:27 Cool. Thanks for the answers. Shame you only represent 19% of production. And a shame the other 81% continue to desecrate the habitat.

So what's really needed is for buyers to be encouraged to buy only RSPO-certified oil.

5211 2018-09-10 14:54:53 Have I ever mentioned how much I hate getting my oil changed? I hate it soooooooooo much. Sooooo much.
5212 2018-09-10 14:54:49 If you compare then add crude oil price too to get fair valuation.

5277 2018-09-10 14:48:12 I just have one doubt. It is not showing the crude oil price of that year. Were the crude oil price same as now and also rupee value too?
5278 2018-09-10 14:48:06 Real fact......Congress lead UPA rule 2004-2014 the Petrol price gone up 13% mean 130% & Diesel price by 16% average each year means 160%. In BJP rule 2015-2018 the average price went up in Petrol by 13% and Diesel by 28%. Can you figure on top of that UPA created Oil Bond debt.

5292 2018-09-10 14:47:16 面白い小説を読むと、最後の章のあたりで「コレ読み終わると楽しみが消えちゃう」ってなってしばらく放置するんだけど、やっぱり面白いから続き読みたくなって、楽しいと淋しいが入り乱れる。今、畠中恵さんの『明治・妖モダン』ってファンタジーもの読んでてコレに陥ってる。
5293 2018-09-10 14:47:16 Oh really, listen to your PM of those days. Money doesn’t grow on trees and oil bonds are disaster. Whilst you subsidised and transfer the problem to future, you didn’t solve the problem
5294 2018-09-10 14:47:14 Teeblizz is funny abeg. Person dey oil  your woman engine steady.... You dey talk nonsense
5295 2018-09-10 14:47:14 Think of all the gas and oil used to transport these goods from China to the US. The massive amount of pollution generated. And Dems say they are worried about climate change. 

How does so much trade (shipping goods overseas) help the environment? Let that sink in.
5296 2018-09-10 14:46:52 Y don't you ask for Oil Marketing Companies balance sheets as well from that era and minute details of all the loans/bonds that they took. Also do check whether those loans have been cleared yet n which Govt cleared it. You surely will get a crystal clear picture with all facts.
5297 2018-09-10 14:46:44 I think it's a fair chunk, for ongoing projects rather than specific events, and they don't seem to qualify  for some other forms of assistance. The impact of new oil exploration on the Caribbean has hardly been discussed  yet, has it?
5298 2018-09-10 14:46:37 Grocery shopping, laundry and oil change.. mannn shiiii

5303 2018-09-10 14:46:26 I have some suggestions for this oil crisis,
Keep some quantity of petrol and and diesel on monthly ration basis without excise to families with 5 lakh of salary. Let rest who can afford purchase it at market rate. Then there will be no issue for opposition to raise on non issues
5304 2018-09-10 14:46:20 Then got GreenLeaf Ultrasonic Essential Oil Diffuser & Humidifier at MAKRO. I prefer it. I love it as a humidifier too.

5307 2018-09-10 14:46:04 It's depicting percentage of increase in prices, not the actual prices.

But still it's a very misleading graphic because in 2014 the international crude oil prices were at an all time high. They're half that price now, so it doesn't justify the high domestic prices.
5308 2018-09-10 14:46:02 I think they're shitty too. That's why I want my government and the governments of the UK and the US, to stop approving arms sales to them and admonish their human rights record. Which they won't because they're addicted to that Saudi oil and cash.
5309 2018-09-10 14:45:48 I don't think you've been paying attention if you think opposition to increasing oil production is failing.
5310 2018-09-10 14:45:47 He drove a consistently  false narrative on Tesla to help his company's investments in offshore oil platforms, etc...  Gimme a break.
5311 2018-09-10 14:45:42 95% of the billionaires in Nigeria that do not pay tax are politicians that stole billions from Nigeria. It’s not easy to evade tax when you run a real business like manufacturing, oil production and Telecoms. When you point a finger, Four are pointing back.

5314 2018-09-10 14:45:37 who paid oil bills??  That too along with interest of 70000cr. Why oil bonds issued??  Where is fuel subsidy and excise gone???  Rotting in home of Congress..

5325 2018-09-10 14:44:26 Palm oil is ruining land everywhere. It may be cheaper than other oils but is not healthier than others. So why not grow healthier plants? Quit the deforestation that is causing global warming. This was the hottest worst summer of my 70 years of life. Endangered species is huge.

5341 2018-09-10 14:43:08 So, Mr. Shah meets the oil minister in the wake of huge outcry over the rising petrol prices. Surprising, as he is not a part of cabinet but not uncommon though. But technically he should be meeting his Saheb, right? What will a poor oil minister do? Bolo bolo...
5342 2018-09-10 14:43:02 Not this government, UPA government started removing subsidy from 2013 end. This government just maintained it. And to talk about increase in petrol prices, what would have been the scenario if crude oil was at $140/barrel. Modiji's chest would have been 26" maybe.
5343 2018-09-10 14:42:53 Rather then doing a #BharathBandh how about pulling out bicycles and don't buy petrol or diesel for one week and see the impact on revenue from oil. #thatShouldMakeADifference

And of course, Jack is appealing to the Musk fanbase. He knows Musk is spewing chunky PR sludgewater.

5382 2018-09-10 14:39:21 @narendramodi 
If we collect a fixed amount/ltr as a tax/profit for diesel/petrol will help common man to deal with global price hike. The global variations directly translate to user with lesser burden of tax. Govt should fix the revenue needs rise from Oil firms and decide tax.

May be looting money for upcoming election???
5389 2018-09-10 14:38:35 This can also include processing, research, training & development facilities, eg. Sarawak be centre for Gas, while Sabah lead in Oil. Oil & Gas is not cheap to develop, hence it's.more prudent to share cost & resources where feasible. @mohdshafieapdal @GPartiSwak
5390 2018-09-10 14:38:34 I strongly oppose #BharatBandh bcz during entire period of UPA inflation was 10% or above. & Why forget Onion loot every 6 months which fetched their Agr Min. About 1200 cr every six months.This figure was explained by prominent citizen of B'lore.UPA raised oil bonds of 200 cr.

5423 2018-09-10 14:35:55 ok so you can try alfalfa tea, also any mint essential oil diluted in a carrier oil like coconut or olive oil can be applied to the area
5424 2018-09-10 14:35:54 Funny how Dick Cheney argued that deficits don't matter as a justification for invasion of Iraq.  That price of oil skyrocked from 20 to 138 a barrel.  And that Halliburton needed 70 a barrel to justify fracking.  Same breakeven number as that pipeline too.  Imagine that.
5425 2018-09-10 14:35:47 Demonizing palm oil in the name of orang utan, the truth is commodity competition. It has many fierce competitors. Media and NGO are tools.
5426 2018-09-10 14:35:47 It just shows the percentage increase. Though it shows only half of the truth. They dint compare it with Crude Oil Prices. Bas.
5427 2018-09-10 14:35:28 Hey anyone got any Crisco Oil I can borrow..a few splashes should help
5428 2018-09-10 14:35:17 i is the silly voice of desperation. Cruz will keep his racist and oil base but he will lose everyone else. He has sold his christian soul

5446 2018-09-10 14:33:45 Crude oil is continously falling in international market but there is price stepping up in Indian market. Bjp government is been doing nothing in this regard. This is the time opossition must take a stand
5447 2018-09-10 14:33:41 I swore I was about to pay 40$ for my oil change. Shit was 62 dollars. I’m mad lol.
5448 2018-09-10 14:33:40 Let's threaten to invade Venezuela and see if that helps the Chinese gain a foothold in Latin America? What could possibly go WRONG for us? Who else has oil we can "privatize"?
5449 2018-09-10 14:33:36 Every time you tweet, Waister, you demonstrate that you really don't understand any of this.
Norway has everything we have, and more, because their oil money was used properly, not wasted by a neighbouring country to fuel inequality and profits for the rich.

क्यो जनता को बुधू बनाने की कोशिश कर रहे हैं.
5454 2018-09-10 14:33:11 Its a good news. You must immediately think of reducing import bill of which oil is main component. Replace oil consumption in IPPs with natural gas to reduce import bill hence no deficit. Circular debt issue will also be solved.
5455 2018-09-10 14:33:11 You forgot to add the subsidy bill and the oil bonds.

5462 2018-09-10 14:32:46 But you forget househelps have less bills to pay from rent, food, shelter some also get good bosses who even buy their essentials like oil and pads so they can save all that contrary to others out here

5477 2018-09-10 14:31:11 We were lied to about Vietnam, about both Iraq wars, about Libya, and now about Syria. WaPo had an article 6 mo ago about how we can't leave Syria because then we'll lose control of all the oil fields we've captured. But sure, the war is about ISIS.

5482 2018-09-10 14:30:42 Are you claiming that Norway has not changed since 1970?
Norway has spent as much on infrastructure & services as we have (or more), & has better wages, less inequality, less unemployment, etc; and has extra income from oil fund investments.
you don't need oil for infrastructure
5483 2018-09-10 14:30:41 Major achievements so far of PPP govt

Wait, what?
5487 2018-09-10 14:30:35 @PMOIndia  A new India will be built through empowerment and not rebates. Government for decades not promoting alternatives despite knowing that Oil is not affordable to the country, with sheer revenue objective not curbing corruption does not help.

5497 2018-09-10 14:30:00 Germans will likely be paying more for heating oil this winter, sector analysts say, due to the US-Iran conflict and lower drought-affected rivers, which have made it more difficult to transport oil around the country by boat. (Welt)
5498 2018-09-10 14:29:58 How much tax do you think Govt levied on oil products. If 28%+luxury tax+sin tax. It will not fullfil Govt kitty. No party interested in GST on oil products. Oil products all govts milching cows.
5499 2018-09-10 14:29:42 Govt.should try to cut Taxes on petrol/diesel,else completely ban the sales of new cars n bikes,so that manufacturers can force the open to reduce oil prices, or charge 2000₹ /month from the cars parked on the roads,1000₹ from 2 &3 wheelers,or will lose in elections.

5510 2018-09-10 14:28:39 prices r correct. u can check from indian oil website. graphics is about percentage hike so 28 is less than 83. not about absolute price.
5511 2018-09-10 14:28:34 Ugh I hate when people dont do their jobs. You're a lead tech & get paid double what i do. Can at least make sure the fucking van has oil in it.

If people accepted liberalisation they will pay cost of it..

Again telling delivery of goods far better managed after demonetization so diesel rarely affected prices....No more talk on subject.
5514 2018-09-10 14:28:32 You must work for oil companies to be this ridiculous 

It’s simple, stop giving away  resources to foreign tax evading corporations for a pittance and collect a fair share of the revenue for the government to be reinvested in education, healthcare, infrastructure, etc
5515 2018-09-10 14:28:26 The RSPO is aware of the challenges within the palm oil supply chain, which is why our P&C cover not only environmental standard but also human rights and labour conditions. We're encouraging all stakeholders to follow our standard for sustainable palm oil production.

5517 2018-09-10 14:28:21 BJP's ideas!
After KA elections...they said "104 > 118"
Now they say..."We increased petrol only to 85....from 70...They increased from 50 to 70...so our percentage is less!!!!"

Idiots....When Crude oil was 70 USD a barrel - UPA priced petrol at Rs. 40 / litre - not Rs.85/litre

5523 2018-09-10 14:28:07 I would say this to you “dictator” if we (CNDs) saw the oil sands run with the same fiscal prudence as Norway, there would be a lot more support for the industry. Not just oil insiders getting mega rich and leaving crumbs for everyone else.

5527 2018-09-10 14:28:02 Cbd oil is available in the UK legally. This is only one half of the equation though, THC being the other half which is not legal.
Some conditions only require cbd, the high profile case recently in the UK news required both compounds to have the required medicinal effect.

5532 2018-09-10 14:27:10 Sir, the UPA was subsidising oil by using oil bonds which is basically like a credit card & a debt trap. NDA government has repaid 2 lakh crore.....1.3 lakh crore of repayment and 70000 interest. Isn't reduction of per head debt a benefit?
5533 2018-09-10 14:27:09 Oil free too!  Even better.

5553 2018-09-10 14:25:41 I request the current government of India ie BJP to kindly look in to the oil prices as it's hurting and hitting M-O-D-I sirs value and image badly...
Please get this oil market under GST and close the issues against the government and make your base strong for next several years
5554 2018-09-10 14:25:38 Completely mind boggling, what’s going on. I was there decades ago before oil development was so big. People seemed to be doing well way back then. Was it the Maduro government that dove so deep into oil investment?
5555 2018-09-10 14:25:35 其實我以前是念應外系的

5557 2018-09-10 14:25:05 In other countries in Middle East. Arab Spring started out with a lot of talk about Billion's n oil & people thought they should get some of that money because they felt Oil was every1s & not just Government's. They were getting like 2Dollars a day 2live on! Simple Economics!
5558 2018-09-10 14:24:58 if tomorrow crude oil will reach 110 per barrel will BJP give 71.4 per litre? same as 2013 MMS
5559 2018-09-10 14:24:55 Did we forget that this is an oil coup and amidst the war on women and children and elderly and America and rick perry is on his way to Russia? And...

5565 2018-09-10 14:24:30 I’m sorry, but this is just giving cable television too much credit.  Anything major outlets can do to put bad ideas in their place is appreciated.  There are plenty of platforms for snake oil salesmen, and CNN is not responsible for the US’s ignorance.
5566 2018-09-10 14:24:30 It is right if you go by percentage but BJP is taking all fools in the ride again as they are not mentioning the price of crude oil at these timings.
5567 2018-09-10 14:24:30 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.

is it still available on android? are ppl gonna smash their iPhones and iPads??
5571 2018-09-10 14:24:13 Petroleum refers to crude oil and not petrol.Petrol and Diesel are petroleum products The graph as the title suggests refers to % reduction and not absolute price

5575 2018-09-10 14:23:45 Can you please show crude oil prices during past two decades
5576 2018-09-10 14:23:40 @rsprasad ravi the amount of tax that ur govt pour in oil of rs 30 ..is it not ur fault..the thing is that u are a failure and u like persons never admit that u are a failure and nation is suffereing because of ur egoistic decisions..
5577 2018-09-10 14:23:39 Annoyed because why am i still sitting here getting a oil change 
5578 2018-09-10 14:23:30 Socialism makes ppl poor. Only a tiny elite are well off. See border btwn Colombia and Venezuela. The bridge may break by the weight. Oil rich Venezuela broke bc socialism.
5579 2018-09-10 14:23:26 Let us have the crude oil rate as well listed
5580 2018-09-10 14:23:25 良くないわよ！！！！！私の事は遊びだったっていうの！？！？！？！？！！！？！？！？？？！？

5582 2018-09-10 14:23:16 Human rigths are not part of your vocabulary, rigth? talking about ppl, if you are stupid you should die of cancer or if you like to be and oil on canvas artist and not a carpenter that can make a table, you should not deserve anithing at all. Is that your point?
5583 2018-09-10 14:23:04 Just got done getting my car inspected and an oil change done.  Now to do groceries and then go home and make some homemade soup for the hubs.  The boys both have Scouts tonight too. I think I'm going to be too tired to fit in writing tonight.
5584 2018-09-10 14:23:04 I'm sure he doesn't even know how and where you check the oil. 
5585 2018-09-10 14:22:59 Sir when decreasing the oil prices and when politician give up their subsidy,general public following your word,once try to your cabinet minister for this

5587 2018-09-10 14:22:54 @pepboysauto just got an oil change at Pepboys in Scranton PA that comes with a complimentary tire rotation that wasn’t done. How do I know, I have two brands of tires on the front and the back. Maybe the oil change wasn’t done either. #pepboysnomore
5588 2018-09-10 14:22:50 Drink your coffee as black as Wesley Snipes then add some coconut oil in it the same way you apply it to the person you love

5594 2018-09-10 14:22:19 A request to the Bandh followers. Destroy as many vehicles as you can. ‘Na rahe bans, na baje bansuri.’ The whole problem is the wrong policies of the previous Congress Govt to encourage automobile sector without having sufficient supply of oil. Why not the public conveyances?
5595 2018-09-10 14:22:19 okay so I need a boyfriend who will pump my gas for me and do all of my car inspections and oil changes and stuff...I’ll fund it I’m just not trying to do it

5598 2018-09-10 14:21:54 Our Woodlawn location will be closing the wash due to the weather but our Gas Bar/ Oil bay will remain open for regular hours, propane will still be available til 6pm.
5599 2018-09-10 14:21:53 Yeah I know sweetie. You’re going have to try not using your right hand for a few days. Maybe rub some lavender oil into the skin in that area. 
You have always been there for me & it breaks my heart knowing what you’re going through daily & u often beating yourself up about it
5600 2018-09-10 14:21:50 bhaiya, they are showing percentage increase in oil prices which was 42% increase then 83% and now its 28%. The rate of increase has decreased. I can see that and I suck at Maths
5601 2018-09-10 14:21:40 I am not the original poster, but I believe it is an oil on board.
5602 2018-09-10 14:21:27 That to without any reference to crude oil prices in international markets

5611 2018-09-10 14:20:43 @VP A bank should not send Iran currency, until November, the Iranian regime should never issue a barrel of oil, sanctions must be implemented with all power, to bring Iran's terrorist regime to its knees.

5614 2018-09-10 14:20:36 Nobody knows the reasons for hiking oil price but people blaming and protesting. Called #BharatBandh. We the people are very innocent really. We melted quickly in low temperature by bad politics. At the end of the day:
सचमुच मेरा भारत महान।
5615 2018-09-10 14:20:35 誰だっていいだろ！！！！
5616 2018-09-10 14:20:32 could maybe use that oil.......
5617 2018-09-10 14:20:30 true, but, any speculative jr always has a binary event of which is most evident on resources plays, ahem 1 drill hole or oil well wonder usually leads to further speculation of which turns up nothing economical.  as for pot plays all about earnings growth, if it meets or exceeds
5618 2018-09-10 14:20:27 Dr. Duffer who took public money in form or oil bonds, then given subsidy from public money? The great scamsters and it's pets like U would always fool people of India! Even if petrol reaches Rs 200/liter will vote for Modi so ho and put it wagging gain to some use!
5619 2018-09-10 14:20:17 Big oil deal?

5622 2018-09-10 14:20:09 It doesn’t produce as much oil when you stop washing as often. I use a shower cap. If I am going out I either dry shampoo or condition it in shower to freshen it up, then style it.
5623 2018-09-10 14:20:04 Kindly paste a graphic of crude oil prices since 2014.
5624 2018-09-10 14:19:58 common man is suffering bcz of upa decision of subsidizing oil by taking credits, which is an interest trap.
5625 2018-09-10 14:19:55 this is graph is based on increasing % price in oil
5626 2018-09-10 14:19:34 @VP In the case of sanctions, I have no doubt that the full implementation of the oil and bank sanctions on President Trump's winner in the November election. India and China are the main buyers of Iranian oil and should cut off their oil from Iran,
5627 2018-09-10 14:19:22 "Try a salad without lettuce: garbanzo beans, tomatoes, onion, bell pepper, avocado, olive oil, lemon &amp; pepper. Mmmm"

5630 2018-09-10 14:19:02 BJP govt might be dipping into our pockets. But your party dipped into exchequer, waylaid us, scammed us and transferred wealth to your personal accounts. Your oil for food scam is not forgotten too. Let not murderers and looters lecture us
5631 2018-09-10 14:19:02 Lower your gaze. Q24:30.May Allah help us.
5632 2018-09-10 14:18:54 He’s going to back the US in destabilising the UK because we have oil?
5633 2018-09-10 14:18:52 Political convenience... no crude oil mention 
5634 2018-09-10 14:18:47 もういっそ消滅させてくれ(薬がなくなった途端悪化した)
5635 2018-09-10 14:18:46 What is the opposite of out?  In. Globalist? Isolationist.  Everyone believes it should in safe borders. Strict immigration. But enforce in fairly and equally. Why leave our Saudi Arabia? Every 9/11 hijacker was Saudi. They weren't banned. Oil. That's why. It was racist

5638 2018-09-10 14:18:33 OIl in some EM currencies at or next to all time highs .... Here in Brazil we had the same kind of protests early this year. But the difference is that here, because of our dependecy on truck drivers, they stoped the hole country
5639 2018-09-10 14:18:31 Sir, crude oil price is also a big role in price hiking time which is completely ignored in this comparison.
5640 2018-09-10 14:18:29 Yay! Thank u! I called the glue trap company & asked how to get a snake loose. They were shocked. I used olive oil too and it worked! Thank u for saving them! Those traps are awful.
5641 2018-09-10 14:18:28 OLD DAYS ....OIL TOUCH $$ 100+++. TODAY OIL IS BELOW$$80. INDIA COMMON PERSON S PAYING ABOVE Rs.85 PER LITER ...BAD SIGN FOR THIS GOVT...MY VIEWS

5656 2018-09-10 14:17:07 @chetan_bhagat It's a histogram about increase in oil prices in % terms, which is lower during NDA 2.
5657 2018-09-10 14:17:01 Logically  Expression them self cheap publicity, showing in graph they are not upto mark increasing Oil price
5658 2018-09-10 14:17:00 The index is now 17.3 percent below its level at the beginning of the year. Its comparative value NYSE Arca Oil also fell significantly last week by minus 2.3 percent, but is still 12.6 percent higher than on January 1.
5659 2018-09-10 14:16:58 I rubbed some 活络油 wood lock oil (a curious and most excellent English name) on my knees the other day for the first time after slapping (拍打) them for a good 10 minutes to fix my crappy joint, felt and smelt like a proper old lady, haha.
5660 2018-09-10 14:16:39 Bhai us samay ka crude oil ka rate bhi check karo
5661 2018-09-10 14:16:36 Tujhe bada pata hai. Jo 2004 ki DI oil prices 2001 me 13.75 piece the  or 2014 me near about 62 Rs ye prices kya Tere bap ko Nahi pata hai.

5662 2018-09-10 14:16:31 It was likely mocking the rest of the world.  WWI was in part about imperialism, Britain on verge of bankruptcy vs Germany's access to oil, and the war fueled by banks.
5663 2018-09-10 14:16:20 That has nothing to do with BREXIT. It is the impact of the world oil market Surprised you do not know the difference!!! But Remainers will enjoy bad news even if it is not relevant.
5664 2018-09-10 14:16:20 Haha, you forgot to count the Rs. 2 lakh crores worth of oil bond bills that you left as legacy for the bjp govt to pay, along with 70000 crores in interest alone. This is coz you artificially kept the price down to win elections. 
Maths mein ab bhi pappu hai tumhari party. 
5665 2018-09-10 14:16:17 Wait, she never answered! Tbh, if there is even a possibilty, you need to question your relationship, especially if they were double stuf

5670 2018-09-10 14:15:39 True you. That's the Policy China is Using Now in Africa. Contracting Roads with crude Oil value which can't be measured. Leaving pur oil filed dirty yet they are getting the honey of the land
5671 2018-09-10 14:15:33 Uhhhhhhhhhhhh a little bit of feta cheese in the salad ain’t too bad, but it HAS to be with oil vinegar tho.

5676 2018-09-10 14:15:13 You've heard about soy being "estrogenic" but phytoestrogens are found in many whole foods, with flax being #1 on the list.  Sesame seeds, olive oil and strawberries, too!  Don't be afraid of plant based estrogens and avoid the manmade xenoestrogens.

 Israel citizen pays up to Rs 126.73 per litre which is 61% more than  the average petrol price. Shockingly, diesel price is about 65% higher than the world’s average. Reportedly, Paz oil company ltd holds more than 30 percent of the Israeli fuel market.

5682 2018-09-10 14:14:05 They think it highlights beauty features. The average man doesn't have that much oil to squander.
5683 2018-09-10 14:14:01 I don't buy the argument we are modifying anything or breaking IP rights. All we are doing is operating the vehicle. What's next, I can't change oil......
5684 2018-09-10 14:13:44 F*ck pipelines. They are hidden subsidies of the true cost of the delivery of oil that rides on the backs of real property owners whose property is obtained through government coercion below market rates making it harder for alternative energy to compete.
5685 2018-09-10 14:13:41 Centre and States become greedy on getting more from oil taxes.
5686 2018-09-10 14:13:31 Why did UPA didn't paid Oil Bills..

5689 2018-09-10 14:13:24 "Bandh or strike" is not d only solution of opposition. Bt central Govt shd take step against hike of oil price & weak of Indian currency.
5690 2018-09-10 14:13:23 Again I'm not denying that. Those were the same people that sunk the Titanic. They start everything for gold and oil I'm not denying any of that. My point was the US were the deciding factor in both world wars

5694 2018-09-10 14:12:57 Too early to bring it under GST as 6.4B$ UPA oil dues...
Even If they do it... They'll  just cancel the GST on your books.

0w-20はLSPI的にどうなのかは少し気になる。Mo増量は有利ではあるけども。

India spends more money on importing crude oil than anything else. Nearly 80% of the country’s fuel needs are met by imported crude oil.

Who increased taxes in fuel, state or centre?
Y no rate cut when prices were down in crude market?
Is 80 lesser than 71?

5774 2018-09-10 14:05:15 The graph is fine. Bar doesn't represent Oil price, but percent increase.

Between 2009 and 2014, price increased by 83%. Between 2014 and 2018, it increased by 28%.

Read the graph topic.
5775 2018-09-10 14:05:07 It is percentage hike of 5 years without reference to crude oil rate...call it MISLEADING GRAPHICAL PROPOGANDA..

5819 2018-09-10 14:00:55 What’s the source of this data.. politics of data manipulation is another aspect to look into.. also look at the data in crude oil price and vis a vis petrol diesel retail during this period
5820 2018-09-10 14:00:50 @STSWR Last week, bus 13270 had two issues on Eagle Street in Cambridge near Laurel. 1. Belching black smoke coming out of its tail pipe. 2. An inability to proceed without stalling after stopping at rail crossings. Perhaps an oil change and/or driver's training are in order?
5821 2018-09-10 14:00:45 Example. Saddam Hussein nationalised Iraqi oil taking the profits away from Western oil companies. How much are those profits worth?

Also, war is costly for US taxpayers, but for US weapons manufacturers, its very profitable.

5846 2018-09-10 13:59:05 Patra sir, your quality of speaking is now degraded. Now you are only blaming opposition in one way like CPI and TMC candidates. Sometimes please ask your own party, rupees is going down, oil prices are increasing day by day. No BJP ruling state came forward to decrease tax.
5847 2018-09-10 13:59:00 This is great! My only gripe is the measurement of benefit, far better to say "umpteen million barrels of oil kept in the ground.

5850 2018-09-10 13:58:47 2009 to 2014 increase ws attributed to higher crude oil price but during 2014 to 2018 hike is attributed to hire in excise duty which is under control of govt.
So why BJP has posted this??
5851 2018-09-10 13:58:43 Yup,along with the oil bondburden left by UPA, Just do it

5855 2018-09-10 13:58:37 You need to calculate the subsidy paid by UPA to the oil cos for the first 8 years. If you take that subsidy, the actual increase per year comes <1.20, whereas the present govt let the prices fixed by oil cos n the crude price is <1/2 compared to the UPA regimen.

5904 2018-09-10 13:54:23 very good this data is accurate but @DocVatsa this is also true  
Govt repaid over Rs 2 lakh crore on account of oil bonds during upa tenure.
petrol price is high because UPA left 2 lakh crore of oil debt for nda gov.this amout is without interest .
5905 2018-09-10 13:54:23 2 lakh crore oil bonds with 70,000 crore interest which was paid by Modi govt.

6024 2018-09-10 13:43:00 Sir - I agree absolutely. Also - IMHO - why doesn’t the Oil (or whatever) Ministry explain to the public as to why the petrochemical prices are rising and what can be done about it. I am sure the Indian public is tolerant enough to appreciate the situation.

6090 2018-09-10 13:37:26 Big joke it is. There is a need to have strong economic policy sir inorder to compete with other countries. Look for the ways for appreciating rupee and reducing oil prices. Govt is taking 50% of money through taxes. Therefore no savings for a common man to improve his livelihood
6091 2018-09-10 13:37:23 • The RBI and Oil Ministry advised refiners to settle dues in three months from 30th May 2016 onwards after which government owned corporations made the payments.

6115 2018-09-10 13:35:31 • Sanctions placed by the United States upon Iran in 2011 made it impossible for the Indian government to transfer the full amount paid for oil purchased from Iran due to a financial blockade.
6116 2018-09-10 13:35:23 Political and military wars as well as the end of the developed countries exploiting these countries.
Developed countries like black oil, especially in Africa and the Middle East.
They do not like the people of the region, so they use it as a selection material.
6117 2018-09-10 13:35:20 Bharat Bandh failed completely which means public has effectively rejected opposition version of demonetisation, GST, hike in oil prices and fall in rupee against dollar etc. and is with Government inspite of some hardship.

Opposition need to explore another issue perhaps....

6136 2018-09-10 13:33:11 I just did. Read my tweet. Oil bonds are a structural issue. And they're just conveniently discovering this problem now.  This is not credible reason why prices are high now.

6138 2018-09-10 13:33:00 Same price when price of oil per barrel was $145. Today the price is $69 why are the prices at gas stations so high should it not reflect the crude price and be around 70 cents ? Oh the refinery’s.....

6153 2018-09-10 13:31:18 Let me break this down for you sparky. Obama levied sanctions on Russia to cripple them financially at the behest of Saudi Arabia (because they want to sell oil), Russia sells oil primarily to two markets: Europe and China. But Saudi oil runs off the Petrol Dollar. 1/2

6166 2018-09-10 13:30:17 There was spending problems in #Alberta before the #NDP ever arrived. The difference here is the NDP made a decision to invest in infrastructure during the downturn knowing that eventually oil prices would recover. Infrastructure benefits future #Albertans so it has a sound ROI

6171 2018-09-10 13:29:44 They have lost it , it seems. Though maintaining fiscal deficit is structurally plus but on vote bank metrics they would loose until oil turns bearish soon. A rate hike in October is imminent.

6182 2018-09-10 13:28:20 Because of oil inflation caused by the Cancellation of the Iranian deal
It's planned to see America losing (20.35 Million barrel/day x $74/barrel x 365 day) - (20.35 barrel/day x $45 x 365 days) = $ 219 Trillions in one single year

Just like my statement about clean air/water.

6217 2018-09-10 13:25:28 Just one question, what’s the crude oil prices during this period? If crude oil prices where lower between 2014-18 then what made the government increase the prices by 13%? Forget reducing? That’s the explanation required! Please explain this!
6218 2018-09-10 13:25:18 Is he for real   Is he losing his  marbles “oil” 
6219 2018-09-10 13:25:15 My Grandfather looked like that back in the 50s & 60s he had a Fina, & Mobil station, & yes they would do everything on  your car, fix flats, tune ups, oil changes. Self serve, like Walmart took out local Dept stores, was the death to locally owned Stations. Thanks for the pic.

6225 2018-09-10 13:24:59 That's the point genius, it didn't happen because Trump got elected. Obama's Iran deal artificially curbed inflation by bringing oil proces down at the cost of hundred of thousands of human lives.
6226 2018-09-10 13:24:57 @aajtak 1 Barrel of Crude Oil
Rs 4896
6227 2018-09-10 13:24:50 The crude oil price is much less than what are you all charging, you all have imposed so much tax on petrol why?
6228 2018-09-10 13:24:45 What about the 1.42 lakh oil bonds that got issued to hide the price hike and pass it to the next generation. Talk about that too instead of talking moronically in absolute numbers. Add both and then come up with such comparison numbers. Seriously who teaches you guys economics

6231 2018-09-10 13:24:44 Reality is India has to reduce oil imports.. Any government will suffer this hikes.. Congress did before now BJP and future governments too..

6263 2018-09-10 13:21:38 Because of Texas' history of Oil and Gas, the state ignored its labor force and cut regulations. Result: low wages and taxes. Migration from Rustbelt led Texas to rely on recruiting experienced and educated workers from northern states. Thus, little ed and training of residents.

6275 2018-09-10 13:20:34 Also said looking for dollar earners, they don't want to risk with the local currency, Nigeria does have a mature oil industry, a dollar earner.  Our debts are in dollars, they create a demand for $ and we're not well cushioned. When Gov starts looking for $,  weeee

6284 2018-09-10 13:19:30 Ckongress&left party trying to divert the common people. The truth for hike the value of petrol is Global war & decrease of production of cruid oil for USA pressure.

6289 2018-09-10 13:19:18 It is frustrating the common men. They didn't pass the benefits to the people when the crude oil prices went below 25$/barrel. Though they increased excise at that time. Now they are crying foul. Government is doing business.
6290 2018-09-10 13:19:16 Anil ji, please provide more details on your 6$ oil plan and all countrymen will support you. Let people realise the benefit of capitalism and help destroy this bogus propaganda developing against industry and industrialists.

6295 2018-09-10 13:18:56 Not only Raga his party supporters are also different Beed.This is reality behind artificial protest. Foreign trade,Crude oil prices, international situation not in favour of us is reason for oil price rise.We are not reducing oil usage,Is this not every citizen's responsibility.
6296 2018-09-10 13:18:49 What about the 200000cr oil bonds your government took which this government had to pay?
Even your PM who hardly spoke had said that he knows that this is not the right thing to do. The burden of these oil bonds will pass to our future generations.
But this govt paid all that.

6326 2018-09-10 13:16:38 From 2008 to 2014 int. Crude oil rate increased from 30$/l to 105$/l.so rates went high.
From 2014  to 2018 int.crude oil rate decreased from 105 to 70 and rates still are going increased.
Stop making fool. It's enough.
6327 2018-09-10 13:16:27 Pipeline isues is the cover story. In reality, it is much easier to transport oil than gas. Wells are ten times smaller in the Permian than Appalachia, therefore it is difficult to transport gas. The gassing out of new wells is very disturbing and has little to do with transport.

So what happened to remianing Rs 9 trillion? Why isn't fiscal deficit at long term tgt of 3%? Why GDP growth under NaMo slower than UPA2?

6354 2018-09-10 13:14:10 Is that water or snake oil in that jug?
6355 2018-09-10 13:14:00 True. We are governed by glib sellers of snake oil, and credulous enough to swallow it by the gallons.

6368 2018-09-10 13:13:07 I worked in the oil&gas industry for a decade.2008 it hit a rock bottom of 35 usd/barrel and then when i quit the industry in 2016 it was around 70 usd/barrel. But not decreasing the selling price accordingly only helped us repay the loans of the oil purchase. Am i right or wrong

6375 2018-09-10 13:12:36 Now this brain dead has to understand. Crude Oil prices can not be controlled by taking any decision by india.
6376 2018-09-10 13:12:35 #2019KaPetrolBombPlz ask the questions...1.What the hell oil companies have do in the field of R&D.   2. Why you not ask the question to minister of oil and natural gas about the hikes.

6378 2018-09-10 13:12:29 And bjp has paid 2 lakh crore of pending oil bills. BJP is not  running country on debts and subsidies. India was in 2013 fragile 5 economies. At present in top five strongest economies. BJP has taken strongest diciscions be it gst, bankruptcy bill, tax reforms, demonetization.
6379 2018-09-10 13:12:28 He had no intention of making America better. His handlers would not allow it. He had a brown bag filled with money,snake oil, a mouth that delivered eloquent words like Castro or any other Communist Regime designed to promote a vision of Hope,which we all have. Trickery .
6380 2018-09-10 13:12:26 Unfettered greed is going to be the death of us. The coal, gas, & oil industries of America in particular who have managed to convince the GOP that pretending Climate Change is a hoax is a winning issue.

6382 2018-09-10 13:12:13 Oil and electronics are the 2 big imports. Better to transition to electric transportation and to indigenize electronics
6383 2018-09-10 13:12:06 Wud have been good if you cud have mentioned the crud oil rate as well...
6384 2018-09-10 13:12:06 For every Rs they collect 15K as ED. For every price rise, their ED also goes up.  They are literally running the Government on OIL money just like TN Government running on TASMAC. Only way is to pack them off in 2019.

Any idea!
Or should we ask this question directly to 10JP?
6397 2018-09-10 13:11:14 Cheers mate and thanks for the RT! Was going for a bit of an oil painting look with the highlights in the water. Hope you're doing well 
6398 2018-09-10 13:11:07 Next time mix it it a bit of coconut oil or scent free lotion. Lol

6400 2018-09-10 13:11:01 Along with crude oil prices, please also share the amount of oil bonds which UPA had given to oil companies and interest which was paid. Also share how oil companies were run down the hole of spiralling debt. Ghotalebaazi ji ke param PiDi ye bhi poochlo.

6403 2018-09-10 13:10:49 There wasn't any revolution. There were only west's oil capture, gun sale and Israel's Iran's Russia's etc. ambitions. Turkey has been a home for over 4 millions of refugees spending over 30 billions of dollars and Turkey is to blame? You are not aware of the facts
6404 2018-09-10 13:10:48 @sambitswaraj Debate is on oil prices & it’s ur give job 2 control it U blame on Iran Venezuela Did tht lead 2 increase in excise duty? U talk of China money fr communists Wht abt ur money from ONGC? R u qualified as Director of ONGC? Shit man
6405 2018-09-10 13:10:44 gotta get my oil and shi changed today before I fuck this mfer up 
6406 2018-09-10 13:10:44 But fact toh hai. Even if it’s a small factor, there should be a correlation between fuel price and global crude oil rates. Personally I believe all fuel prices need to have staggered rates, to demarcate luxury from necessity. But India mein uska bhi jugaad nikaal lenge log!
6407 2018-09-10 13:10:43 They are responsible for falling rupee, unemployment,  inflation, oil prices, farmers sucide. But responsible are also lala ramdev, Anna, Bedi and people in power who created anarchy in country on the same issues.   #CongressKeGunde
6408 2018-09-10 13:10:43 You do know that we owe money to our suppliers bcs of oil trade. .

6410 2018-09-10 13:10:38 involved. 

Nope, all he had going for him was that he knew his way around a guitar pretty well and that was all he wanted to have going for him. 

What was he supposed to do if he didn’t do something with music? Work at the oil refinery? Nah. He decided he would pass on that.

6413 2018-09-10 13:10:32 Haha....I was JUST thinking that “snake oil salesman” describes him perfectly! And there you tweeted it! I think you’re dead on and it fits him perfectly! He lies with that swagger that people just flock toward. They get mesmerized and actually believe his lies! Quite astounding.

6417 2018-09-10 13:10:20 Couldn’t this be explained by pipeline issues? Completions slow down so new well production slows and older wells get gassier over time as is expected? Once pipeline is available completions go up then oil goes up GOR goes down.

We didn't question the company's actions in creating this problem. We were just sad for the birds. I'm older and angrier now.
6425 2018-09-10 13:09:11 Problem has started from the day when Modi ji gave price control in the hands of oil companies. Congress never did it.

I tell you , currently government give zero subsidy on fuel congress used to give more than 50000 crore. Congress paid from oil bond means they bought oil on credit card.

6510 2018-09-10 13:01:37 Few questions
1) Why did congress not pay the oil bills and passed it to the next govt? 
2) why did congress push the oil psu companies near to bankruptcy?
3) why were the food inflation near 15% when congress ruled and it's now 1.8% even though the fuel prices are high?

6517 2018-09-10 13:01:18 I seem to recall that when gasoline prices did not fall quickly enough when OIL did, we were told that because of the shutdowns, the refining of oil into gasoline was slowed down causing a shortage in gasoline.

6519 2018-09-10 13:01:08 Oh, I thought solar could never make it without subsidies. Panels are so cheap Now! With grid nighttime batteries solar will grow even faster. Unlike oil, coal and gas solar has very low cost once installed. My rooftop system just needs cleaning periodically.

6525 2018-09-10 13:00:50 Better to compare crude and taxes. For how much price drop tax was increased.  I get an image of 'K' if visualised more or less

Overall they taxed more money than oil bonds afaik. And used for other pro poor projects. But we still hear unutilized money compared to budgeted
6526 2018-09-10 13:00:47 Modi is not defending at all, he just allow market to play the roll and at the same time paying Rs. 150,000 Cr. oil bond debt that Congress govt. in the center created! The over all inflation in the country is just 4% which was in 2013 13% in UPA rule, why ?

6574 2018-09-10 12:57:04 Grossly misleading. The huge oil bonds piled up by the UPA to make up for the deficit of oil companies. All these plus interest has to be serviced. Plus 40% of excise duty goes to states. Running a huge fiscal deficit leading to inflation, were landmarks of upa.

6579 2018-09-10 12:56:38 Ahhhhh 

Okay 

Got it. 

Rate of increase ! 

Hmmmmm... That's a bad way to compare it. 

Rate of increase is not credible, coz it considers only time periods. Without taking into account global factors like crude oil prices and government taxations.

6587 2018-09-10 12:55:40 I am not going to vote anybody else just because I have to pay few bucks extra on petrol. This bandh is for showing power of oppn through gundaraj which is unacceptable to me. Idk y media is behind this hype. Crude oil prices chnges due to international changes.

BJP govt looting poor people
6593 2018-09-10 12:55:06 Who will has paid Rs. 150,000 Cr. oil bond? A debt created by Congress lead UPA govt. and its great economist PM Mr. Maun Mohal Singh! Modi is responsible leader and will not compromise nation's future!
6594 2018-09-10 12:54:55 How can you (or your propaganda writer) have the nerve to call anyone a liar?  Trump and Truth are never seen together. They are the oil and water of reality.
6595 2018-09-10 12:54:49 2.14 Lakh Crore worth of Oil Bond+ iran debt around 44 thousand crores + interest )this mismanagement given by (congress UPA )to @BJP4India @aditiraval @vagishasoni @kajal_jaihind @imDPRK we have choice like eclectic vehicle to reduce crude oil import bill.
6596 2018-09-10 12:54:46 When you compare to peers, MC is too high on #Ukog. That aside, fair play to those involved for achieving commercial oil.  Just too expensive.

6606 2018-09-10 12:53:22 I did nt blame , I just mentioned abt deregulation that’s why fluctuations in price. This Govt increased tax to repay oil bonds. To reduce the price Govt have to issue fresh bonds and so it will be carried on for ever.

Central government succumbed to opposition and asked oil companies to reduce prices!! No.??

6614 2018-09-10 12:52:54 Also mention percentage increase in crude oil prices . This graph is misleading.
6615 2018-09-10 12:52:53 At that time crude oil price was 147 dollar per barrel.  Now crude oil is 76 per barrel.  How can compare  you at current price.

6623 2018-09-10 12:52:09 You better look into where money collected from VAT &Central excise on "oil" has gone. Consumption of imported fossil fuel is to be curbed by all means, including high taxation.This is resource raising should be welcomed as all govts in future can count on it as a genuine method.

6649 2018-09-10 12:49:42 Refiners (i.e. oil PSUs) have to pay to Iran not Govt. Govt. had to pay PSUs for the subsidy amount, which they did using oil bonds. Thus, pushing the can down the road. Showing low deficit artificially because of cash based a/c in govt/budget.

6683 2018-09-10 12:46:54 Do you have information on how crude oil price decrease in last 10 years?

B4 2014,  Crude oil was $110, in last 4 years it came to $26 to $70.

UPA time tax was Rs.9 per liter petrol & now BJP govt is taking Rs.19 tax.

Then  who is giving good service on petrol to people?
6684 2018-09-10 12:46:48 Yes, oil bonds were not bcs of Sonia or MMS, they were 'invented' by Chidu in his UF days to 'fudge' books and show lower deficit. UPA 1 - 2 was just a repeat show. Oil bonds got no connection to Iran payments (affected by US sanctions). 1/2

6712 2018-09-10 12:43:39 Sure, Modi too can create an oil pool deficit account, pay oil companies with oil bonds, redeemable only later, to be paid by the next gov, to the tune of 2k crore and bring now the petrol price to around 60/litre. But he won't do it. Cuz he'll have to pay it in his next term.

6716 2018-09-10 12:43:19 Govt. quietly pocketed crude oil price cuts by increasing excise duty. Should have equally quietly restored crude oil price to excise duty ratio when crude prices reversed. Vehicle users should not be made to bear disproportionate burden for social benefit schemes.

6741 2018-09-10 12:41:09 Nobody knows the reasons for hiking oil price.....but blaming/protesting.#BharatBandh #Oilprice_Modifails 
Incredible India undoubtedly!
We the people of India are very innocent. We are melted by very low temperature politics.
At the end of the day:

6744 2018-09-10 12:41:03 Did everyone forget that we elected a Prime Minister who was supposedly pro-environment & opposed to oil pipeline expansions? How there r more careers being created in renewable wind & solar projects every day, but he buys & wants to expand the pipeline now bcuz JOBS? #CanPoli
6745 2018-09-10 12:40:55 They'll pretend to burn the midnight oil. Only way this pipeline will be built is when the liberals are annihilated at the polls. Can not come soon enough,Trudeau is treating Canada like some damn social experiment.
6746 2018-09-10 12:40:54 I don't mind shavings, but I usually find whole radishes too fiery. These, though - bit of oil, salt, pepper, garlic - more mellow, still juicy, soft but not too much so... mwah *chef kiss*
6747 2018-09-10 12:40:53 That's what the US does when it doesn't get its own way, destroys civilians by the millions, they really don't care as long as they get the oil
6748 2018-09-10 12:40:52 Is India planning to buy oil from Russia?
6749 2018-09-10 12:40:49 Why do you think the foolish virgins don’t bring enough oil to last until the coming of the Bridegroom?
6750 2018-09-10 12:40:47 @QandA Why doesn't the elephant in the room get raised? The oil, coal and gas will start to run out soon. Another driver for renewables.

6801 2018-09-10 12:37:47 2.....This phenomenal rise of 6B $ in a year is attributed less to rising  oil prices and more to CPEC imports from China. We have 9 or 10B  $  reserve left which are worth two months import bill. So IMF  package,  among other proposals, is a way out from this mess.

6848 2018-09-10 12:33:19 I might be wrong, But Bro when you see the barrel price then and now it's different. So they should have reduced the price which is visible to common people and left oil bond Dept. Too much good is not good

6881 2018-09-10 12:30:12 what about the % age graph for international crude oil price.? in 2014 $135 and now $70.
6882 2018-09-10 12:29:57 Let's vote for NDA again, I don't have a doubt in it.. but GoI has to tackle this increasing oil prices. Even if they burden our children I don't care, or for that reason nobody cares. So they just pass that debt burden to Indians.
6883 2018-09-10 12:29:57 Article contains the answer. "Despite Pakistan State Oil’s assertion that it saved money, Aziz, the committee head and a member of Khan’s party, said there are still concerns over the deal and will likely recommend the matter for further investigation by government agencies."

6899 2018-09-10 12:28:48 oil price in international market has gone down from $112 (during 2014) to $68 per barrel (current price) then why the petrol price is rising. Instead it should go down. this govt is responsible for price rise coz we r paying tax to center as well as to state.u guys r culprit.

6905 2018-09-10 12:28:33 When combined with solvent recovery at the mines, this will greatly reduce the carbon footprint of this oil compared to other world sources. Technology as it should be, for the greater good. Well done Alberta!

6957 2018-09-10 12:24:16 Compere to internationale market rate. India artificially kept rate below ₹100. Check European rate (except, oil is below market rate in USA and Alberta Canada) and rest of the world.
6958 2018-09-10 12:24:14 As per adjusted inflation rate the crude oil price in 2014 was 88.47$/barrel and today it is 39.60$/barrel. Crude oil price is less than half today than that of 2014, then how come price is increased by 13%.
6959 2018-09-10 12:24:11 @muglikar_ ji can you please tell me this... one of my friend argued in this manner... oil companies have collected money from people, where it gone???
6960 2018-09-10 12:24:01 So, increasing royalties would provide more tax revenue for our millions more people.  I don't understand why there's a push-back on increasing royalties on oil companies.
6961 2018-09-10 12:24:01 Today is going to be a “spa day” for my truck: new tires, oil change, new fuel filter, exhaust fluid added, rear sliding window repaired, and, of course, a deluxe wash.
6962 2018-09-10 12:23:46 True that. Waise, now Modi should cut down on excise duty and road cess till Global Crude Oil prices restore to normal. Also, he should direct all BJP ruled states to reduce their VAT, and the ball will be back in the opposition's court. He can checkmate opposition but would he ?

6982 2018-09-10 12:22:05 Whom exactly #BharathBandh is against?

Is it against  UPA govt that took Rs 2 lakh cr loan on oil bonds & increased petrol price frm Rs 37 to Rs 82?
Or
Agnst da man who repaid someone's loan of Rs 2 lakh cr with interest of Rs 70k cr &
increased petrol cost by juz Rs 5 in 5 yrs?
6983 2018-09-10 12:22:03 Govt must rationalise the taxes to bring down petrol / Diesel prices tax amount should be fixed not variable in proportion to cost of refined oil . Taking mean at Rs 35 being cost of import price taxes should be Rs 25 if import price comes down to Rs 25 tax will be Rs 25 1/2

6997 2018-09-10 12:21:35 Today I saw some people riding on bikes and cars protesting against price rise of crude oil. They have burnt several thousands litres petrol and diesel in this protest instead of saving it. Is it an wisdomful act to reduce the demand of petrol and Diesel?

Petrol hike it's either blaming congress -subsidized n issued oil bonds in past or BJP is Falana Dimka. Rise above psycophancy & blind support Implement GST Cut tax
7001 2018-09-10 12:21:14 Even though I believe the cost was already high during the congress period, there was a universal price increase of crude oil which gave them a chance to justify. 

Now my question to you is how do you manage to trick people that you are a specialist in trade, money, banking ?

7016 2018-09-10 12:20:05 I endorse his views. We are lacking national character. We have become self centric & are least concerned about our duties. India is importing 85 percent crude Oil . Why are we not reducing consumption of petroleum products. Blaming Govt.for everything is not right approach.

7027 2018-09-10 12:19:28 Lot of information or may be fact coming w.r.t petrol price in India vs crude oil per barrel. They should also add 3rd dimension to it inr vs dollar. That way we will get clear picture or fair reason for the current hike in petrol price.
7028 2018-09-10 12:19:25 Modi Govt collected about 10 Lakh crores in taxes in which as per Oil Minister Pradhan, the govt has already paid the dues related to Oil Bonds. Even after paying for the dues of 2 Lakh crores, govt made about 8 Lakh crores. Makes room for cut in taxes in petrol .

7037 2018-09-10 12:18:41 Yeah because Venezuela gave so much subsidy on oil which they produce that they have no food, right?
Hell with other policies and political conditions, I must say govt. should increase the petrol price so that people get food here.

7057 2018-09-10 12:16:16 With the dollar index keep rising throughout the course of 2018, one can assume it as the cause for fluctuation on oil price. However, it's the logistics chain of oil which impacts its price and not the dollar index.

It is high time we should substitute Fuel with renewable sources of energy. Fuel price protest will not make our future safe.
7104 2018-09-10 12:11:30 Oil bonds were a temporary measure to absorb the oil shock after crude prices rose above US$ 100 per barrel (peaked at $150). These bonds were wisely paid off  using high taxes garnered after oil prices fell below US$ 40( bottom at $22). Now crude is rising- so please cut Taxes.

7262 2018-09-10 11:53:46 YES!!! I used to rub an essential oil blend into the hat I wore every day for comfort. When I was feeling the need, I would pull my hat down over my face and sniff it.
The hat got ruined and I'm struggling really hard about it.
7263 2018-09-10 11:53:45 It will look like a "rump Yugoslavia" because Scotland will declare itself out of the UK. It would be much easier to do than, say, Quebec leaving Canada. Westminster can kiss all that oil money g'bye.
7264 2018-09-10 11:53:44 Politicians here are busy Creating Electricity, Oil & Gas based Policies to benefit their Business Friends who own Pvt Oil & Gas & Power & Renewable Energy Firms.. They Amend the Electricity Act to Benefit Pvt Renewable Energy & Thermal Power firms is an Example of Corruption..
7265 2018-09-10 11:53:34 Mr ex Prof;  Great MMS askes OMC to subsidise and issues Bonds for Rs 2L crs which NDA has paid Now. Being cash accting not shown by Govt . Isn’t it typical window dressing ? Oil subsidies brought down from avg 1.8 L crs to 30k crs. Who is a better PM ; Mr ex Prof. Be honest
7266 2018-09-10 11:53:33 I hope the opposition spokesperson does not say - They called bandh in order to reduce petrol and diesel consumption - which leads to lesser import of oil and help strengthen the rupee against $.

7269 2018-09-10 11:53:02 Hmmm which one of my oil and gas holdings should I compare to #UKOG......
7270 2018-09-10 11:52:31 @dr_maheshsharma Sir please don't give wrong analysis u r saying that crude depends on international situation then why crude oil wasn't gone down when crude rate gone down to 26$ p/b? even that time too petrol rate was 65 rs why not gone to 40 rs p/l??
7271 2018-09-10 11:52:21 eww. For that I'd recommend you trying rubber snake oil.
7272 2018-09-10 11:52:07 Boiling in oil.
7273 2018-09-10 11:52:02 hey why is that #Congress is unable to counter these allegations like #PetrolDieselPriceHike in 2012 #bjp made it a issyue despite knowing that it was #CrudeOil prices of over $100 that caused #PetrolPriceHike but this time crude oil is much lower but this government isnt capable

7275 2018-09-10 11:51:45 #Kolkata is a dead city. I dont understand why this idea of shifting office has its genesis. Would be interesting to know. Oil & gas is produced in NER & if we are acting East, then it is no point shifting it to West. Defeats the purpose, bring back a colonial legacy.

7281 2018-09-10 11:51:26 Damn my oily job! There's a reason most of my work clothes are black. I couldn't wear my green t-shirt because I discovered an oil stain that hadn't come out in the wash, so I'm wearing a black t-shirt that has "not today" on the front. Gives out the same message.
7282 2018-09-10 11:51:09 Any media or business disruption of significant size brings with it a wave of charlatans and con men. Sadly, far more than the easily fooled fall for their snake oil socercy.

7293 2018-09-10 11:49:00 Whatever it is sir.. Common Man doesn't understand all these jargon. All they want is some relief to the sky touching prices.
What is stopping the Center & State Govts to reduce some the taxes they increased in last few years when crude oil price went as low as $25?
7294 2018-09-10 11:48:54 11 lac crore was used for defence ,  healthcare scheme , lpg connection for poor . Road n electricity for village. No loan , no interest no oil bound .subsidy biggest fraud ofchor INC.

7299 2018-09-10 11:48:27 How about our oil prices are determined by the increase in the world market, seeing that we don't have our own ?
7300 2018-09-10 11:48:21 Intl crude oil prices in 2004 were $36 and in 2014 it was $96 almost 175% increase

7302 2018-09-10 11:48:13 That's because the super genius economist PM kept issuing oil bonds instead of actual money and raked more than 2 lakh crore in debts that this govt has paid back.
7303 2018-09-10 11:48:08 It smells like all African pride oil and incense in the office.

Probably will turn out to be one of the most telling quotes of the UK #fracking agenda.

There’s a reason none of the big names do #shalegas as their primary business. It’s Steptoe to the oil industry’s M&S.

7307 2018-09-10 11:47:58 This was Venezuela in making. Fortunately oil prices came down, & BJP acted swiftly to save country from meltdown.

Now refusing to subsidise again is right thing, but media morons are distorting it.

Why the fuck do women have to cook for your lame ass? cook your own fucking food once in a while Pakistani men!
7315 2018-09-10 11:47:21 That's what I don't get. How are people so convinced that electric cars are better for the environment? They may be here in the US since we're not mining a lot of the heavy metals (China is), but all that stuff is really nasty. What's the disposal protocol etc?
7316 2018-09-10 11:47:09 Great job has been done this is the anger of common ppl against modi govt who failed to control prices of oil & economy situations .
7317 2018-09-10 11:47:08 Just like how congress played around with oil bonds.
7318 2018-09-10 11:47:08 money went to pay off the oil bond which you had released earlier... dont remember???

7338 2018-09-10 11:44:43 And they call for One election for whole India, that means no party will reduce oil price for Five years.

7343 2018-09-10 11:44:16 When sauteeing onions can just cover and cook medium and they will caramelize and release their natural oil and moisture without added oil. Then add spices to roast and get aroma. Practice makes perfect.

7347 2018-09-10 11:43:59 Congress had 2 lakh crores of oil bonds. A small instance of eye washing the public and creating long term burden! Modi needs time as she clear points out! Congress has screwed up our economy for 6 decades. Expecting modi to convert India into States in 4 years is a joke.
7348 2018-09-10 11:43:58 Had a bad experience at #Walmart yesterday. My wife had her oil changed and they either left the plug out and didn’t tighten it, either way car is sitting in puddle of oil @Walmart

7354 2018-09-10 11:43:20 "Modi govt says it was used to clear Oil debts" I have read this only in media reports. Why isn't the Prime Minister or Petrol Minister coming out in public domain & stating the same?

And we should not forget that crude oil price during UPA2 was >$120 as well, unlike $65 rt now!
7355 2018-09-10 11:43:06 Somebody told me to take a break and just relax. I should try and enjoy nature. So I decided to take a walk one day. The pot holes, trailers and oil tankers, shops in the middle of the road would not let me enjoy nature. #Nigeria
7356 2018-09-10 11:42:57 First come out in the open on the Oil bonds that the UPA governments issued & then let the public decide who pocketed how much money.

7359 2018-09-10 11:42:11 Wasn't that payback for Chavez fully nationalizing oil reserves, confiscating tens of $ billions of Western Investment?  No fan of US sanctions, banking cartel, etc., tho, but doubling down on Chavezista socialism accelerated the decline, too.

7361 2018-09-10 11:42:06 If you cut expenditure by govt, it’s hands are tied for welfare schemes. If u print more money, there will be more inflation. It was a time bomb left over by Chidu to explode. Further there wasn’t any guarantee that oil prices will come down. 2/n
7362 2018-09-10 11:42:00 I think what you meant was you inherited a smooth running machine from Obama and decided to drain the oil and toss in a handful of sand.
7363 2018-09-10 11:41:52 & who paid for oil subsidiy bill which was hidden by Ur corrupt FM?... don't think ppl r fools like Pidis...
7364 2018-09-10 11:41:51 Go learn Venezuela’s history.

Chavez, off profits from oil, implemented socialist programs that reduced poverty by 50%+.

Oil prices go down, can’t pay for those programs, economy goes to shit.

Problem wasn’t socialism, but lack of diverse economy.

7393 2018-09-10 11:38:33 No bhakt is defending fuel hike. past or present. Point here is steep rise of oil from 2009 to 20014 vs 2014 to 2018. The gap tells the story. However, when the oil price was down same tax was put. Modi govt says it was used to clear Oil debts.
7394 2018-09-10 11:38:32 RT warned last week that USA was arming Al Nusra to fake another 'Chemical' attack on the poor Syrians in another bid to steal their oil and resources while claiming a Regime change is essential for Peace:)))))!! What a joke! As if USA wants 'peace' 4 anyone?

7412 2018-09-10 11:36:56 No Ashu, I think there is a gap in understanding. For subsidy UPA gave bonds to Oil companies, oil companies hypothecate those bonds to banks to lift the cash as they r sovereign bonds means clean asset in balance sheet. When payable u print more money or cut expenditure. 1/2

7446 2018-09-10 11:33:25 Yes, it was an effective way to up-sell to customers. Because the price of gas was so low, the real money was in oil, new tires, and belts. The service wasn't particularly indicative of a more gracious time.

Or

Against the man who repaid someone's loan of 2 lakh cr with interest of Rs 70,000cr &

7485 2018-09-10 11:29:24 AUM
If oil prices are rising,take measures to bring it down. Bharat Bandh was a sheer act of foolishness led by the biggest buffoon as named by Mukhya Mantri of Telengana. If politics is guided by jokers, their party men are doomed. Foolishness in a family show engulfing nation.

Don't be a Bhakt. Hv some courage to ques ur elected Govt. on it's failures.
7498 2018-09-10 11:28:13 One thing that the price of ₹72 is higher than prices during UPA tenure. Next, most of the price during BJP tenure is due to taxes, not international crude oil price. Hence, BJP has increased tax rate on petrol/diesel as compared to UPA

7522 2018-09-10 11:26:34 Can you create a graphic showing the no of oil bonds paid back by the GOI and compare that against the taxes collected. That should help in clearing up this mess
7523 2018-09-10 11:26:33 But what does the #BharathBandh brings? We, common people are getting affected. Why not you piliticians protest before oil companies? And what @INCIndia ruling States doing. They can reduce the VAT and set an example right.Bhandh is just fof political drama.
7524 2018-09-10 11:26:32 Dont you know like banks and NBFC gives loans against FB, Gold, shares, PPF, LIC moneyback policy, Post office saving scheme etc.

These oil bonds worked exactly in that same manners. 

Oil companies settled their dues and bills by giving thoes oil bonds like money.

7651 2018-09-10 11:10:39 Oil was cheaper and around before this government came to power in 1998. Yet, They were one of the best countries in the world. They took over all aspect of Venezuela.

Demise of all socialist countries is a matter of time.

7653 2018-09-10 11:10:28 Petrol prices are not rising because of International oil prices. It iS rising because Modi Sarkar charges 81% tax on petrol and diesel #BharatBandh
7654 2018-09-10 11:10:15 Endless oil story
7655 2018-09-10 11:10:12 UPA regime mein tel ki kimat kam ka reason oil bonds the. Something which the next government had to pay for. So basically, UPA took a loan to subsidise petrol. Don't compare, go fight for reservation.

7657 2018-09-10 11:10:05 Winning an election by the rules is not stealing anything. Trump had a broader base of support in more states than Clinton, which is why he won and she lost.
7658 2018-09-10 11:09:59 you are missing the 2 lakh crore OIL BOND that your government taken and this dispensation is paying...
7659 2018-09-10 11:09:53 Exactly what I am saying.
So the rise in oil prices have nullified that portion's effect.
7660 2018-09-10 11:09:51 Ya but we’re NOT defending our nation. We’re running cover for the oil industry abroad. Btw, military healthcare was best I ever had.

7667 2018-09-10 11:09:19 It is where the term stagflation came from, the 70s, when growth stalled but inflation continued.  They came from both wages but also when demand exceeded supply in several areas, oil being the most influencial in the economy. 2/

And those pipes don’t unclog themselves.
7670 2018-09-10 11:08:52 Basically, congress swiped a credit card to give a false sense of low oil prices during their regime via subsidies. Now the BJP has to cover up Congress' doing and foot the bill essentially.

7693 2018-09-10 11:06:51 This is an utter lie. Every outstanding had been provisioned for in the year, oil purchases were made. It was because of sanctions, payments were withheld to certain countries. Shameful that bootlickers have to resort to lies to earn their daily bread crumbs.
7694 2018-09-10 11:06:49 After eight years in office, Barack Obama has a market record any red-blooded American capitalist could be proud of. U.S. shares have soared, oil prices have come down, borrowing is cheap, and profits are up along with the dollar. Obama handed Trump a booming America.

7699 2018-09-10 11:06:15 Nothing will change , BJP will allow petrol to go till 99 rs per lt and then will reduce it 10 rs by election time... and people will be like sasta ho gaya..  anyways india will stop buying crude oil from Iran leading to more price of fuel.

Congress subsidy raj policy (year or two before elections) resulted in those oil bonds

7777 2018-09-10 10:57:58 Great episode. 
We know about 65-70% of the energy used to make H2 is lost when compared to just charging a battery. This is a fact. 
H2 is quite simply oil companies and car makers trying to hold on to the fuel station model so they can keep selling us fuel. 
Not happening.
7778 2018-09-10 10:57:53 I was referring to other indirect taxes like octroi etc being eliminated in the logistics field. Thus reducing the cost of transportation.
GST of course doesn't have impact on VAT/Sales Tax for oil.

7781 2018-09-10 10:57:35 I just wish the democrat people on that side could understand how many millions get siphoned off and pocketed during "illegal invasions" actually hits billions. It's sad how easily brainwashed people can be from a polished govt snake oil salesman.
7782 2018-09-10 10:57:31 I was lucky, drilled oil wells overseas for a living. My income doubled but when I retired, Health Insurance premiums went from $370 per month to $2,950.
So with no taxable income, I still am paying out of pocket.

7810 2018-09-10 10:54:12 Midi govt did not save that UPA govt ate that money see the chart for the year it was subsidized, this the scam UPA did and upon that UPA issued oil bonds worth one lakh 30 thousand cores which accumulated 70 thousand crores interest which was paid by oil companies

7829 2018-09-10 10:51:47 "The unrest has put a spotlight on corruption in Iraq’s economic capital, just as the Ministry of Oil seeks foreign investment – including from China – to transform the country from an importer of oil products to an exporter."

7832 2018-09-10 10:51:32 So, CBD refers to cannabinol, there is no THC in this product, it is therefore completely legal. Cannabis oil generally refers to oils that have both THC and CBD, such as those in medical cases that have been on the news recently. The difference needs to be made clear.
7833 2018-09-10 10:51:29 Cuts!is not easy  like giving discount sale as it effects fiscal,and crude oil is not in our backyard to give it for half price, raising global crude price &stronger dollar have affected us badly,agree the govt must intervene quickly but the state govts also need to join hands

7839 2018-09-10 10:51:05 Reliance was  an oil and gas energy unit. Nobody talks about it now and I do not think it is growing. RIL was concentrating on Jio. Now they have to be content with no. 3. They are now concentrating on retail. I have sold my shares of RIL.
7840 2018-09-10 10:51:00 Crude oil price alone determines the price of petrol or diesel?

7846 2018-09-10 10:50:01 Also there is a risk of oil goes far too high compulsions for nations and people to stop using it all together and move to other sources ... already know people shifting to metro (trains) more and more to nations looking at bio fuel and electric and more

7906 2018-09-10 10:43:50 while the hike happened by a good % then compared to now, subsidies too increased for which 2Lakh crore oil bonds were issued to oil companies. Those bonds had to be repaid by current govmt due to which it could not pass full benefits of oil price decline during initial years..

7915 2018-09-10 10:43:00 Fuel is essential for goods transport. Can use alternate modes for commuting, like Public transport or car pooling. Best, bicycle, if the distance is short. Must curtail fuel consumption, which anyway, is only benefitting the oil exporting countries.
7916 2018-09-10 10:42:57 This is good for US Economy BUT not good for India. 
This is aiding political propagandas of @INCIndia n @RahulGandhi is using this to run anti-MODI (@narendramodi ) campaigns.
@realDonaldTrump should exempt India from Iran oil sanctions, provide India with cheaper crude!
7917 2018-09-10 10:42:51 Madam what do you say about the unpaid oil bonds of UPA govt..
7918 2018-09-10 10:42:33 Meri knowledge mei ye secrecy maintain karna chah rahe hain. Baaki may be mai galat hu yha.
Pr agar oil prices pr protest karna tha to atleast workers ko peaceful protest sikhana tha pehle. Ye line har party ke liye hai be it INC or BJP or any other.

7931 2018-09-10 10:41:11 the responses am talking about are opposed at EVs  on the basis that they get charged from fossil fuels. you gotta start somewhere: eliminate cars as consumer of oil then power larger plants by nuclear, wind, hydro....who will supply these cars and homes.

7942 2018-09-10 10:40:02 Probably biggest risk to that sentiment is going to be rising oil prices this fall. Although rising interest rates may be causal of falling LFPR also.

*Some are predicting $80 bbl oil very soon, which is a very big jump from $60 last year.
7943 2018-09-10 10:39:50 @narendramodi @PMOIndia Sir when oil prices were low you increased Excise duty 13 times and now when they r high u r denying responsibilty,sir public is more aware now plz b acountable n reduce oil prices.
7944 2018-09-10 10:39:48 Every moron keeps re-iterating Crude Oil was at $147 over and over and over, so for entire 10 years the trading was halted it never went below $100?

7964 2018-09-10 10:36:13 The other question of course is do you believe it? For the entire Obama 8 years we had glowing unemployment figures. Yet no college graduate could find work, restaurants and malls were empty and closing, our GDP was 1.4, oil was cheap....
7965 2018-09-10 10:36:13 Most countries in the world have Nationalized their oil & gas industries like Norway. 75% of oil produced in the world is produced by National Oil Companies. 80% of electricity produced in Norway is by hydro electric production so oil is not needed & can be exported.

7969 2018-09-10 10:35:37 Eaxclty both state and central govt need to lower taxes. Some burden of oil cos can be taken care by increase in direct tax collections and sales tax revenues.

7983 2018-09-10 10:34:08 Any knee jerk reaction from Govt will not be good in long term.. Oil market will be volatile in coming months... Govt need tax to run welfare and development agenda. Don't confuse people. Burden is more psychological than real..

8034 2018-09-10 10:29:29 It I because of your govt taking oil bonds of over ₹ 2000000000000 that this govt has to do this. And you are trying to act as if you haven't done anything wrong and trying to fool people. This is not 2004, when you and your media wrapped the people around wrong narratives.

8036 2018-09-10 10:29:27 NAFTA Pproportionality Rule requires that 75% of the oil & gas produced in Canada must be sold to the US. Canada does not own it's own oil & gas, the US does. We don't need pipelines to the coast as we are prevented from selling our oil to anyone but US.
8037 2018-09-10 10:29:11 bhai pehle Congress ka Jo 1.3 lakh crore ke oil bonds or 70k crore ka bill bhara hai uska nahi pata tha shayad aapne bhi nahi bataya

Also pressurised on govt to offer more facilities for NRI so that they can send more dollar instead of holding in foreign land.
8044 2018-09-10 10:28:42 Petrol price in 2004 was 37 rupee and in 2014 it was 78 and now it's 88 coz your gandhi family had taken loan of 1.44 lac crore on oil bonds and this govt. paid that amount along with 70,000 crore interest.
8045 2018-09-10 10:28:41 I remember laughing at my elder brother for eating Bread and Indomie that year. Just look at me now. I put red oil in my indomie. I eat indomie and Egg with bread 
8046 2018-09-10 10:28:31 No. Look at the Saudis. They have no abilities to earn money now that oil is no longer a hot commodity for them. Talk about removing incentives to work harder than your neighbor.

Once you have handle, create policy to the best of ability and knowledge, with specific KPIs at each level of implementation. Empower, execute and monitor KPIs.

8049 2018-09-10 10:28:11 The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and allowing American companies to now steal their oil. Fairly imperialist. The support of Israel when Britain caused the problem in the first place. The control of Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.

8064 2018-09-10 10:25:17 Sir this idea of let market forces determine prices is bullshit when most of the times it is the political forces with their unilateral sanctions that are determining oil prices and wrecking developing countries. Hope modi reconsider this naïveté

8069 2018-09-10 10:24:11 From its Genesis   OIL   became one of the symbols of WESTERN Colonial exploitation of the underdeveloped world and one of the features of the 19th/ 20th Century IMPERIALISM. The main INSTRU-MENTS for this exploitation were the INTER-NATIONAL OIL CARTELS,        (Your Father/ 1h)
8070 2018-09-10 10:24:03 Let me ask, what happened when you went over there for the oil? How did that work out? I know how. It resulted in 2,979 Americans.
8071 2018-09-10 10:23:44 BE/ME boxes are wonderful if maintained properly, but the rods - Peugeot's own in-house linkages - quickly go out of adjustment, and no-one changes the oil at the proper intervals. The later cable MEs were foul; I snapped two in my C4 HDi after a bad day at work and lost reverse.

8073 2018-09-10 10:23:30 @adriearsenault the problems arose in Venezuela not because the oil prices fell down. It is due to the extremely corrupt politicians, the give away of oil to Cuba and other Caribbean countries. The intent is to push people to poverty and full dependency on the government

If u r concerned about us - y in Karnataka were the state taxes on fuel hiked?

8123 2018-09-10 10:17:29 #BharatBandh is a stupid thing. Petrol price are determined by OPEC & other Oil producing countries. Indis plays absolutely no role in it. Rather we suffer their decisions. Holding Indian Govt. & Modi responsible for price hike is utterly stupidity.

8201 2018-09-10 10:09:02 Why not non BJP govts are easing taxes on Petrol and Diesel.

each state has its own set of taxes on oil products that vary tremendously. andhra Pradesh, for example, levies 31 per cent Vat and an additional rs 4 per litre as Vat on petrol. it has a different rate for diesel.

1. One day of bandh causes huge loss to exchequer. Bad move 
2. International oil prices are high, what can govt do 
3. Why is state govt calling a bandh instead of reducing taxes at state level?
8257 2018-09-10 10:02:09 Yes, prices were low. Oil PSU were under big losses. Govt didn't paid bills to PSU as well.

8290 2018-09-10 09:55:47 Why the ENERGY business has to be a blood business all the times?

1) Oil is conducive of wars all the times
2) Energy Batteries are conducive of new slaveries apparently
3) The debate about energy and new energies is conducive of confrontations

Why this?

8301 2018-09-10 09:54:25 Arre Babu, UPA artificially regulated the market and kept oil prices low, by taking loans against oil bonds to the tune of trillion rupees. Manmohan Singh himself said that was temporary solution, and that people later have to bear the burden. You are not fooling anyway!

ಪಾಪ ನಿಮಗೆ ನೆನಪೆಲ್ಲಿ. CM ಸಾಹೆಬ್ರು oil ಮೇಲೆ VATನ್ನು 30 ರಿಂದ 32% ಗೆ increase ಮಾಡಿದ್ದನ್ನು mostly ನೀವು ಮರೆತು ಬಿಟ್ರೆನೋ?

8316 2018-09-10 09:51:47 Thanks for reply, just setting up home profile. Which is pointless since we use oil for heating, hot water and sometimes cooking. Your drop down menus don't show oil as an option. So the "compare to similar properties" makes no sense whatsoever. Can this be fixed??

8326 2018-09-10 09:50:53 BJP spokespersons in TV channels in Kannada channels,the price of petrol is not in their hands!?.What is the excise duty on crude oil in Modi Raj & UPA.What is the crude price when UPA was in power and from last 2 years.This will be evidence for catching their lie.

8349 2018-09-10 09:48:22 I THINK it's because Russia seem to be aiming legitimate targets, ie the terrorists the CIA have been training and protecting. But the Russians and Americans are just fighting over an oil pipeline, billions of dollars but an old energy source we should have given up decades ago.
8350 2018-09-10 09:48:20 Oil prices have gone up. Should we start digging for oil from our backyards too?
8351 2018-09-10 09:48:10 OK. Thanks. Yes I use some of the cooking water too. My recipe is from the Syrian Foodie in London blog, and uses a little tasteless (not olive) oil. Trick seems to be to make the day before and let the flavour develop

8413 2018-09-10 09:40:36 Why don’t you tell the nation that you have issued 160000crores of Oil bonds and did not pay around 50000 crores to Iran. If Modi Government has increased the excise duty to pay off the dues, what is wrong in it. How you would have paid the amount. Only from taxes is it not?

8429 2018-09-10 09:38:17 @H_S_E After making unsuccessful complaints against a site that is hazardous to the public and has now spilt oil all over a public walk way and as you ignore emails do you have a phone number so I can report this?
8430 2018-09-10 09:38:08 I remember we were told to get used to permanently high oil prices....then the price collapsed. Be wary of experts and their predictions.
8431 2018-09-10 09:38:01 Great! But I deserve no credit. The person who first told me that she thought oil had no place in houmous was @ElfredaPownall
8432 2018-09-10 09:37:40 You're a mad man.... My opinion it is. So someone brings a bucket of oil and I'm supposed to praise it... You overestimate yourself.

8438 2018-09-10 09:37:05 The oil industry sits on a 2 years harvest all the time. All paid for in dollars long ago. The buyer sends out the delivery schedule from time to time.
8439 2018-09-10 09:36:24 The question of oil is also in play. The Saudis want a pipeline thru Syria. Assad refused as Russia, his strongest ally would be adversely affected. The Saudis have played an utterly pernicious part in the Syrian chaos from very near the beginning as have the #USA, #France & #UK.

8441 2018-09-10 09:36:19 This is not a debate. Fact is that oil consumption can be reduced if all sections of the population work towards that objective. Much like Swachh Bharat is succeeding because of a people’s positive participation. It is immaterial how one expresses these ideas.
8442 2018-09-10 09:36:13 #BharatBandhBawaal question to @RahulGandhi is why he didn't oppose when UPA took oil from ITAN on loan?
Why he didn't oppose when UPA gave subsidy and increased oil companies debt?
8443 2018-09-10 09:36:12 For Jabalpur NSUI illiterate' s by damaging petrol pump oil prices will not come down , they may even not be aware from where the fuel prices are governed . Their masters have mastered the art of giving subsidies and drowning country under debts .

8467 2018-09-10 09:33:41 The current govt has to pay 2 lakh crore rupees for oil bonds which were issued by previous govt. that is y the current prices are out of control.
8468 2018-09-10 09:33:27 This is not buy and eat from the roadside DABA. INSTANT.  Well sometimes crude oil bought from the equities market r schuduled to arrive even after 2 yrs. it is highly technical procedures.  When the huge oil tankers arrive there also a need to ensure storage facilities at hand!!
8469 2018-09-10 09:33:25 I noticed your use of the phrase "snake oil", which means knowingly fraudulent. That strikes me as a slightly more serious accusation than knowingly delayed or "having failed to demonstrate any significant technology of scale". Thanks for sharing your concerns.

8498 2018-09-10 09:29:46 I agree with you, Modi is not a good politicia, as he is not reducing the oil price. In next few months election will be there and nobody knows who will win the election. So he should reduce the oil to 50 and let people enjoy.. fiscal deficit can go for a toss..
8499 2018-09-10 09:29:27 One study showed that, back in 2016, we imported as much as 94% of our oil requirements, vis-à-vis Thailand which only imported 70%, Indonesia 41%, Vietnam 20%, and Malaysia 10%.

8563 2018-09-10 09:21:19 Trump is unreliable and doesn't have a predictable world view. The US seems historically slow to get involved where it doesn't see its own security immediately under threat. The issue of oil supplies is often a trigger too. It seems to me.

8567 2018-09-10 09:21:12 Do you know why petrol and diesel prices are so high despite a fall in crude oil rates? Because the govt wants to collect extra money from you as taxes so they can spend on more ADs praising themselves!!

8571 2018-09-10 09:20:38 for the same level of taxes in 2013, based on today's crude oil price... price of Diesel in India should be Rs. 33.52, instead it is now almost Rs. 77
Petrol in India should be Rs. 46, instead it is now almost Rs. 88
8572 2018-09-10 09:20:36 Why were oil bonds issued by previous government? How should it have been serviced by the present government?
8573 2018-09-10 09:20:31 High of 72.65 today! Maybe we will see oil bonds. Politically can’t see Govt allowing oil to be sold at 100+. However the bond market is so badly hit now, the Govt will have to force it down institutions throat. Govt should reduce taxes. The tax was wholly a counter cyclical duty

8664 2018-09-10 09:10:13 "a snake oil salesman is someone who knowingly sells fraudulent goods or who is himself or herself a fraud" - would you go that far? Or is that one for your legal team?
8665 2018-09-10 09:10:04 Present Govt had changed system to allow private oil companies to raise petrol & diesel prices at their sweet will. So Govt cannot escape from sharing blame for taking bad decision which is causing sufferings to people  & economy of country.

8673 2018-09-10 09:09:15 Whom exactly #BharatBandh is against?

Is it against previous UPA govt
that took 2 lakh cr loan on oil bonds & increased petrol from Rs 37 to 78?

Or

Against the man who repaid someone's loan of 2 lakh cr with interest of Rs 70,000cr &
increased petrol cost by juz Rs 5 in 5 yrs?

We know Bandhs are 'Bad' for economy and will in no way force the oil producing countries to sell us at lower price.

How is saudi Iran conflict impacting our petrol prices? What is our policy towards imp international affairs bcz it’s all connected..
8916 2018-09-10 08:37:23 Heard & just can't stop laughing at the stupidity. This is absolute crap. I just shared a post & a news item in which MMS himself had confessed that Oil bonds debt shall be borne by next gen. Prove with evidence on your claims of Modi sarkat pusging the debt beyond ₹20L Cr.
8917 2018-09-10 08:37:17 #NoBarathBandhModi Govt. had inherited Rs 1.30 lakh crore unpaid bills of the oil companies during 2009-14. It paid back with interest.

8924 2018-09-10 08:36:45 @arunjaitley Sir while NDA govt may have justification for higher fuel prices but continued silence to explain the reasons like Oil Bonds purchased during UPA govt, are antagonizing the public against NDA. Kindly bring fuel prices under GST immediately. This issue may harm NDA.

8941 2018-09-10 08:34:57 Modi Ji your promises for reducing petrol and diesel prices, often crude oil is at $107.09 during UPA government petrol rate is ₹71.41 and during your government Crude oil is $73 and petrol rate is ₹79.51. How are you doing this #Modinomics @narendramodi @INCIndia #MannatSpeaks
8942 2018-09-10 08:34:53 And so? Do u buy petrol aftr checking crude every day? Or what u pay what matters. Economy was set on 80 in 2014, 7.5% rise normal in 4yrs. If prices reduce by 40%, will MRP of goods & yr salary must come down by that much ? It won't. States will go pennyless tmro without oil tax

9290 2018-09-10 07:48:51 Fuel imports and Rupee depreciation combined along Iran oil export sanctions are causing such high price variations.
Biofuel and Ethanol blended fuels should be made mandatory to keep fuel in a standard good for all price range in #India.
Hope this is implemented faster..
9291 2018-09-10 07:48:49 Sir I accept your justifications BUT What is the justification for NOT Reducing the Taxes our government increased when the Crude Oil Prices were lower. Why can't the Government REDUCE the TAXES NOW or bring Petro Products UNDER GST Immediately.

9323 2018-09-10 07:45:58 Indian Crude oil basket price moved marginally down from $73.47 of July to $72.53 per barrel in August but rupee depreciation pushed up landed cost. In month of May it was higher at $75. If rupee stabilizes prices of petrol and diesel may moderate.

9416 2018-09-10 07:32:49 That's thanks to the coach staff from Congress and the head coach Maunmohan. Wonder who's paying for the crores of loans taken on oil bonds n who's not allowing Petrol become part of GST #zeroIQ #INDvsEND

9418 2018-09-10 07:32:32 Don't be so ignorant. Oil prices are not decreasing because UPA govt left an outstanding of more than 1.5 lakh crores. Modi govt is only clearing that outstanding. But you & ur leader fake Gandhi wouldn't accept that.

9420 2018-09-10 07:31:50 My fiancé had a bearded dragon years ago & it had an infection that they didn’t realize & by the time they took it to the vet it was too late to save the eye :/ so I’d say just take it to the vet for an exam. Also maybe try coconut oil on the affected area?
9421 2018-09-10 07:31:47 Also check the cost of crude oil then and now...
9422 2018-09-10 07:31:44 @rsprasad saw your PC on ABP crude oil price is not in your hand,rupee fall is not in govt control,inflation is out of reach then what d hell you people are doing in govt. @arunjaitley @smritiirani @PMOIndia public will respond to u arrogance in 2019

9423 2018-09-10 07:31:41 Price of oil is not in hand of govt but imposing heavy tax on it is in govt hand why govt charging heavy taxes,why not leave it without tax
9424 2018-09-10 07:31:29 Yes he made us to pay for the sins your government had committed while in power. Have some shame shameless person the pending oil bills left out by your government was paid thru the money collected but then why would u recall that

9427 2018-09-10 07:31:14 Using 2 condoms at once is far less effective than using one properly because the friction of the rubber against rubber causes them to break/rip. Oil based lube also deteriorates rubber & causes condoms to break so use water based products.

Can you now post the values in 2014 before Modi came to power. In 2013 the crude oil price was 120$/barrel now its half

9447 2018-09-10 07:28:21 Neither cong nor opposition hv anything to lose with a global bandh. Further, oil is not part of uniform tax code where states wanted to keep their revenue. Now intl prices rise, central has to adjust&states don't want to lose rev so they raise. Bascially,all screwing common man.
9448 2018-09-10 07:28:20 How many villages, towns, poor people, he has visited.

9452 2018-09-10 07:27:48 Norway’s oil is cheaper to produce and cheaper to use, so it demands a higher price than Alberta bitumen.
9453 2018-09-10 07:27:48 I am not comparing here.. I am asking what they promised and what they did protest for oil prices before coming to the power..

9461 2018-09-10 07:26:01 Dear sir,
You are perfectly right about the prices of crude oil but then modi had to clear loans upto 1.3 lakh crores

9466 2018-09-10 07:25:26 Well, if I think even the central government will ask oil companies to hold their prices for 20 days before each state elections - the way it happened in Karnataka
9467 2018-09-10 07:25:22 Also in 6days the crude oil rate is increased

9473 2018-09-10 07:24:08 How often do you wash your face? A lot of the time, people with oily skin over wash, which creates more oil. Try blotting paper (you'll find it cheap on Amazon) to use during the day instead of washing.
9474 2018-09-10 07:24:01 In 2013 the rate was ₹82.76, & when Questioned your PM Maun Singh told that money will not grow in trees. You have perhaps thought that people have forgotten. Modiji brought it down to ₹60& with the Rise in Oil Prices worldover the rate is now 2013 level. Just RECALL.

9479 2018-09-10 07:23:38 The only thing India should debate is where will the money come from to subsidize the petrol/diesel - by raising taxes? By borrowing from IMF/RBI? Print more notes? Reduce spend on infrastructure? Reduce welfare? Raise money via bonds to subsidize oil and let NextGen pay for it?
9480 2018-09-10 07:23:26 Before it was $130-$144 a barrel. Now it is $42-$57 a barrel. Loom at the difference in Crude oil a barrel and retails. Excise duty on fuel went from ₹3.85 to ₹18.65.
But no reduction in road tax and we pay toll tax everywhere. #BJPLoots #CongressDividingIndia fake IT cell #bjp

9518 2018-09-10 07:18:08 Why @INCIndia is still thinking that common people know nothing about Economics,

1. Oil subsidies in previous era,
2. Deregulation of fuel prices,
3. Central tax & State VAT on fuel.

If the #BharatBandh is against the GST council for not including fuel under GST,
then I agree.
9519 2018-09-10 07:17:55 #BharatBandh for fuel price hike has no logic. Oil is imported if sold for less price will people use it limitedly, definitely no. Their is a requirement of top notch public transportation system all over India.
9520 2018-09-10 07:17:43 In fact, this Government is very sensitive to protect the interest of the Nation. Congress shamelessly made a debt of Rs.2 lacs crores by issuing oil bond which this Government cleared lest India's image would have been shattered in the international oil market. Shame on you.

9540 2018-09-10 07:15:59 I'm happy oil is rising and AMER produces more bbl than Japan right now.

A few out there with large positions in uncomfortably unpredictable companies. The very small MCap can be a bit of a roller coaster.

I've also noticed a lot fighting the trend of the correlated commodity.

Unless you invest on your vulnerable population, your economy is just a facade. Any economy that relied o. Oil like we did will always crash when oil prices dip.
9605 2018-09-10 07:07:13 What about the 2 Lakh Crore Oil Bonds? Can you please share the revised cost during UPA after factoring in this Oil Bonds? These bonds were pushed to be paid 12 years later. They were accumulating interests as well. What UPA did was financial mismanagement. So Shut up.
9606 2018-09-10 07:07:12 I love the fact they are producing at high end of their estimate. Bodes well for future increases to oil flows. Could we see cash pay outs in the future? Solid investment #GKP

9663 2018-09-10 07:00:06 This is happening at a time when the global price of crude oil has significantly reduced. The price of crude was $107.09/barrel on May 16, 2014, while the current price of international crude is $73/barrel. This is almost 40% the price during Congress-UPA.

9665 2018-09-10 06:59:56 They are not exactly less, but whatever the 'control' they maintained was  at the cost of pushing oil companies into massive debts. So, the logic of "crude vs petrol" was failed.

9694 2018-09-10 06:56:21 Poor performance of Indian Rupee against USD can be the one of the prime reason for this. Starting from the crisis originated from Turkey, USD has been strengthened. This will have direct impact on procuring(importing) oil. Apart from this, global fuel prices is elevating.

9703 2018-09-10 06:55:45 Fact: Oil is a finite resource. Fact: at the rate we are using it we will run out in 50-60 years.  
Your grandkids or great grandkids will never benefit from an oil product b/c we keep burning it in our cars, heating buildings and eating off of it. Feels like we could do better

with revenue avenues and distribution, these clowns went for Oil bonds, which rubbed salt into the wound. At some point govt will have to repay this mess. NDA brilliantly brought inflation under 5% and got rid of this OIL bond of over 2 lakhs crore. This #BharatBandh

9805 2018-09-10 06:42:42 Denial gets you nowhere. Wiborg modelled Norway on what Peter Lougheed created in AB by thinking like an owner.

9809 2018-09-10 06:42:23 Dont understand why we need to bring the crude factor here. Did Indians really paid in proportionate to crude earlier or this crude logic apply when price goes down?

9812 2018-09-10 06:41:58 There is definitely some international politics also involved in this rising oil prices and falling rupee, people in the west prefer a govt of their choice, we signed defense deals with France and Russia and even china but not  'them'

9903 2018-09-10 06:30:02 It could make sense if, SGR was to be primariry extended to Lokichar to bring Oil to refineries or extendend to Kitui coal mines
9904 2018-09-10 06:29:58 If it was crude oil that was been mined in Abuja, would the federal government have suspended operations because it endangered lives of residents? #NigerDelta
9905 2018-09-10 06:29:54 wah! when they ruled continuesly for 10yrs they brought up the petrol price to Rs.83/ltr and left after looting the country. now they want to loot the nation again and mortgage the country to oil rich countries & US?
9906 2018-09-10 06:29:37 Who is to blame for the staggering collapse of the price of oil?  Is it the Saudis?  Is it the United States?  Are Saudi Arabia and the U.S. government working together to hurt Russia?  And if this oil war continues, how far will the price of oil end up fallin
9907 2018-09-10 06:29:31 The only way to control petrol price is irrespective of crude oil price, bringing under GST.. but some people's argument is it effects on govt. Sponsored schemes & programs. So Wt we do??
9908 2018-09-10 06:29:09 Pull out and stay out of a snake oil, money making sham fund for slush expenses.
9909 2018-09-10 06:29:08 Relevant chiz ye hai ke sirf "crude oil ka price tab jyada tha, ab kam hai" bol dene se hum convince nahi ho paa rahe hai.
Sachai ye hai ke fluctuation tab bhi tha, ab bhi hai. Instead of creating trouble for people if State Govt.s could lower tax they could be more heroic to us.
9910 2018-09-10 06:29:02 With hair care mainly dandruff I have realised my diet has a major affect on it. When I'm off carbs i don't experience dandruf or skin break outs as much as on carbs.

9913 2018-09-10 06:28:40 Sino ba ang nakaupo ngayon? Bakit di niya/nila amiendahan ang oil diregulation? Bakit mo isisisi sa nakaraang gobyerno ang problema ngayon? Ang gobyerno ngayon ang may hawak sa mga problemang yan. Sila sisihin mo
9914 2018-09-10 06:28:37 Gun oil is not sticky! lol
9915 2018-09-10 06:28:37 I haven't tried the wintergreen oil yet, no.  It moved after the liquid wrench soaked overnight so I stuck with that :)
9916 2018-09-10 06:28:31 You are IIM-A pass person , you should know that dollar and world crude oil price effects oil price , also india 100% relies on import, other side if rupees strong then effects manufacturing export. So logic is there. Opposition doesn’t mean oppose all
9917 2018-09-10 06:28:13 if Its One Nation One Tax so y Not Oil.
is that any challenges or we are just manipulating.
9918 2018-09-10 06:28:12 Congress ne kaise itna sasta diesel diya...were they smuggling crude oil into India...it is possible as it is a party of thugs only..
9919 2018-09-10 06:28:09 何時にこっち着くの？
9920 2018-09-10 06:28:09 I’ve said this for many years and been called a conspiracy theorist. It was all about oil, greed and power. Bin laden funded Bushes presidency campaign. The Towers were brought down by a controlled explosion. The American government are nothing but murdering scumbags.
9921 2018-09-10 06:27:46 9Trust politicians to rarely if ever tell you the truth about messes they create. So what is the way out of higher and higher oil prices. Short of bringing fuel under GST as a separate slab, there's no way out of this.
@ARanganathan72 please pardon me for the lengthy thread. 
9922 2018-09-10 06:27:31 Because oil is a major way of collecting tax for a country like india where majority of people are still not under taxation system. Putting it under gst will make a huge loss to govt. Due to low pricing the demand will rise causing more import,  price hike and hence more loss.
9923 2018-09-10 06:27:14 What a gorgeous leggy oil slick! 
9924 2018-09-10 06:27:13 No the government shouldn’t reduce fuel prices:
1. India’s fuel consumption is increasing at fast pace fueling higher oil price
2. Not much fiscal leeway for goverment
Strategic mistake has been not to investing in EVs to cure fossil addiction and develop future industry
9925 2018-09-10 06:27:08 I respect your choice of diet n education.. I am indeed very pleased with my life since a bit over 4 years ago when I seize a pending stroke using coconut oil n going LCHF.. I’m a T2D in remission.. been months on 5.5 BGL..
9926 2018-09-10 06:26:55 Congress used to give us massive subsidy in petrol/diesel as crude oil prices was $143 per barrel internationally, today it is $73 per barrel and BJP taxes us 5 times the taxes that UPA did.
BJP works in the best interest of BJP and not common people like us.

9937 2018-09-10 06:25:26 I think the original tweet is regarding rising oil prices and the menace? And NOT about demonetization? Or the circulation of cash for the matter of fact?
9938 2018-09-10 06:25:18 8With oil prices on a jump again, state govts want to rake it in as their tax amount is on % basis. They don't care about high it goes, as they'll go on taking in greater sums in taxation. Opposition will keep blaming central Govt for these prices.

9954 2018-09-10 06:23:24 Agreed, however I’m speaking to Mr.Jones & the front office as well. But it’s clear these two coaches cannot get it done with a combination of poor decisions regardless! I’m sick of it! Jerry is a oil plunger, where’s the plunge been? No E.T. No WR. I’m fed up!
9955 2018-09-10 06:22:34 Seriously that gun oil is sticky to me
9956 2018-09-10 06:22:03 Have you tried that baby oil gel with the cocoa butter in it? It worked wonders for me
9957 2018-09-10 06:22:01 Some of you don't have oily skin. Your skin is just dehydrated and crying out for moisture which makes it over produce oil/sebum.
9958 2018-09-10 06:21:55 5When Modi took over, oil prices had collapsed.
With economy in such deep mess from being looted through and through by crooks, inflation high, banking sector in a mess, growth going down, low oil prices provided the cushion this Govt needed to push on many fronts simultaneously
9959 2018-09-10 06:21:42 #BharathBandh. Compare crude oil price with Petrol Diesel price. No political will to reduce the burden of poor.

9962 2018-09-10 06:21:34 What you want to achieve with Bharat bhandh .Do you think oil rates come down ?  You want to do bike rallies to waste your petrol to reduce petrol rate .Think little more .
9963 2018-09-10 06:21:29 Further major barriers are that the 'dash for gas' is less C02 intensive than oil or coal generation but prevents greater investment in renewables. We also still have a transport system with an overwhelming car dependency.

9974 2018-09-10 06:19:39 Why no bandh against high native coconut oil prices which is  Rs.270/- per litre? So,  the bandh on petrol prices is clearly a revolt against Hindus and mother India.
9975 2018-09-10 06:19:35 Sa sobrang SABAW ko, nagluto ako ng pansit canton kagabi. Nailagay ko lang ung ng toyo at oil. Nakalimutan ko ilagay ung powder na seasoning. HAHA! Kaya pala walang lasa, at dinagdagan ko pa ng toyo. Nakita ko lang n walang seasoning pagtapos ko kainin. HAHAHA!
9976 2018-09-10 06:19:27 @dpradhanbjp Sir,why Oil officials never do surprise checking in petrol depots to unearth adulterated fuel,faulty meter reading etc? Nexus?? @CMOfficeAssam @myogiadityanath @DrJitendraSingh @PMOIndia @ChouhanShivraj @drramansingh @mlkhattar
9977 2018-09-10 06:19:21 Do you have any idea what was the crude oil price in that period and what it is now? And whom u asking this? Was he part of the UPA govt? Relevant cheez bolo na bhai.
9978 2018-09-10 06:19:17 You think so? No im not, only being realistic. We are importing grains, including maize, crude Cooking oil. Our local currency has plummeted in the last 12 months. Our budget deficit is nw 1.4b for 6 months in  yearly budget of 4b. Foreign debt is over 18b we arent producng man!

9980 2018-09-10 06:19:07 Now at least people started discussing high oil price...
9981 2018-09-10 06:18:56 But Mr Sinmha, the crude oil was costly.  It was half of the price of that time. Don't u feel ashamed of spreading lie...
9982 2018-09-10 06:18:50 use gun oil and clean it properly
9983 2018-09-10 06:18:34 एकच सांग की पेट्रोल-डिझेल-gas चे भाव आज पर्यंतच्या इतिहासात सर्वात जास्त आहेत की नाही?

मनमोहनसिंग सरकारच्या काळात जागतिक बाजारात जवळपास $150 ने Crude Oil असताना सुद्धा एवढा भाव नव्हता. नको आपली अक्कल जास्त पाजळू.

Today he burned more oil than a two car family will this year.

9986 2018-09-10 06:18:08 Drop your cv with the Petroleum Institute of East Africa at Bruce House. It is the umbrella body for Oil Companies. The Kenyatta Association of Manufacturers, ERC would be interested in your talent. #energyaudit

9989 2018-09-10 06:17:58 It appears the opposition has absolutely no idea about economics. Oil has to latest on international markets and thank your lucky stars you're being charged just 82 paisa per litre. In Europe it's £1.35 and rising daily. Stop crying #FuelProtests
9990 2018-09-10 06:17:54 .@INCIndia @RahulGandhi @cpimspeak @SitaramYechury why don't you prefer indefinite strike/bandh on this crude oil issue. Do you believe this one day bandh will reflect any positive towards price hike? #BharathBandh
9991 2018-09-10 06:17:43 The USA is a democratic socialism. It's on the spectrum such as political ideologies. Venezuela is a communist country like Russia in terms of social programs. Venezuela and Russia have state controlled infrastructure such as oil. However, Russia uses an oilgrachy system.
9992 2018-09-10 06:17:20 Moronjha! The Great Oil Loot and burden of subsidy started in UPA regime and ended now. You are great doing your bootlickers job! Keep it up Pidi.
9993 2018-09-10 06:17:17 I agree with you Madame, except that the rich weren't subsidized with NGN10,000. It's usually in millions and billions of soft & hard currencies, including juicy contracts., etc. Maybe the next phase targeting the poor will be the distribution of free C of Os, oil licences, etc.

9995 2018-09-10 06:16:59 I get that, but there's a small one person shop across the street from my place that apparently only sells a single brand of synthetic motor oil. It's been there at least 10 years.

9998 2018-09-10 06:16:23 @RahulGandhi Against the dual policies of the state of Hitler and the state of Hitler, the wildest price of oil prices today, the people of the common people in India closed to the people of the country, the gratitude and the call on behalf of the youth s #JMM2019 #BharathBandh
9999 2018-09-10 06:16:19 But the overall lead (deficit in the books of oil companies) has been brought down to zero
10000 2018-09-10 06:16:11 I swear the man is part Roadkill Ferret that happened to get stuck in an oil slick on the side of the highway..
10001 2018-09-10 06:16:09 Petroleum was subsided pre 2014, but withdrawn post 2014.  Oil Cos were bankrupt & on the verge of collapse. This was set right post 2014. If old petroleum products pricing mechanism was adopted by the present dispensation, then even our grandchildren would have to live in debt.
10002 2018-09-10 06:16:09 And now, finally, we will turn the tables, and don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.
10003 2018-09-10 06:15:51 And no subsidy & oil bond burden on all Indians.
