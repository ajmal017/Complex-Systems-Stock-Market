44 2018-11-10 23:16:00 Love your work Rohit but I think it is important for traders to understand a FTD is not an all out buy signal. It is a signal that you can slowly start to buy stocks at optimal entry points  and increase exposure slowly as the general market cooperates.

46 2018-11-10 23:14:20 Ubisoft's stocks are super cheap, they started at around 2 bucks in 2014 and now they're at  16 (down from 24 earlier this year). 

E-sports don't have anything to do with it, it seems like every stock had this big jump at the start of 2017 and the market is correcting itself.

61 2018-11-10 22:58:47 3. Banning “large capacity magazines” is nothing but placebo. Magazine changes can be done in less than a second even in high pressured situations. 

4. Banning bump stocks was a waste of time. You really don’t need a bump stock to bump fire any semi automatic firearm
62 2018-11-10 22:51:59 Here are the few stocks I will be watching for this Monday: $NVLN, $PXS, $DCIX. I will be happy to answer any questions about them.

64 2018-11-10 22:50:14 If O&G producers are managed so smartly why then in earth are stock prices for most companies down by 90% over the last years - despite reasonable high prices? Something must be deeply wrong. As long as investors are loading up on stocks, they can still overproduce and burn cash.
65 2018-11-10 22:50:11 Thanks for that.  They did find incompetence though.  The next Gov must replace her, she has done wrong before, and cannot keep up.  Every day millions of transactions for stocks, financial happens quickly and why is it that voting has challenges.

67 2018-11-10 22:48:53 I grew up shooting guns. My dad taught me to shoot a .357, Glock 9, long range rifles and 12 gauge shotguns. I’m all for your right to own a gun but nobody needs a semi-auto gun, period. Especially legal bump stocks or extended magazines. That’s just lunacy
68 2018-11-10 22:48:52 People who don’t follow the law are often arrested. Are you suggesting that if you were required by law to sell back your bump stocks or get a yearly mental health check then you would become violent? If so you’re insane
69 2018-11-10 22:48:27 Good advice. But she should never put all of her apples in one basket. 

Go crypto, go stocks, go ETFs, go Roth/Traditional IRAs, even go investment property if you are wealthy enough.

On Monday, I bought one for $20. On Thursday, I sell it for $50. Minus fees of $10, my total earnings from the trade is $40.

Is that how trading stocks works for the most part?

Would that be a good deal?

83 2018-11-10 22:23:30 So there was a wage increase of about 3.5%, but when you calculate inflation and the raise in interest rates, you’re not actually seeing a bump at all.  Essentially what happened was businesses reinvested the excess money in stocks and made themselves richer...

126 2018-11-10 21:38:29 It's amazing how this little known play has just blown up. Such a testament to the cast & crew for putting on such a wonderful play &I hope to see all you guys in Birmingham(that way I can stalk you all at stage door for atuographs which I couldn't do in London, lol)for a tour.
127 2018-11-10 21:36:18 By the way govt looking for more rolling stocks for them with their direct rewards. Maybe HSTs from LNeR but their new trains not in service till 2020. Govt hand is tight. Hence they called off franchise bidding.

129 2018-11-10 21:33:50 I think defining what those manufacturers can sell in the US ought to be part of the solution as well. (For example: Hunters do not use silencers unless they shouldn’t be hunting who/what they are.) Why should we allow bump stocks to be sold here at all? .3
130 2018-11-10 21:30:53 Overheard my coworkers complaining about how little they we make. Other one said his buddy makes money in stocks. They've worked here longer than me and I bet they don't even realize we have a matching 401k up to 5% and other bennies. They're giving up free stuff.
131 2018-11-10 21:28:17 The stocks are already speaking.
132 2018-11-10 21:28:13 So glad my Tickets are booked x
133 2018-11-10 21:28:03 my take is that stock is obviously the objective best smash mode because in time at a point where time is getting close and one person has the lead it just becomes keep away, while taking stocks keeps both players on the offense
134 2018-11-10 21:27:32 It"s a success. Congratulations at all

137 2018-11-10 21:25:55 Investing in cannabis stocks is probably the best financial move you can make going into the new year. The marijuana industry is one of the fastest growing today and will continue to be the next 3-5yrs.

BUT if you’re scared to lose money, you’re scared to make more money.

140 2018-11-10 21:24:49 Sounds like stocks dropped, time to buy and run like hell and hope you don't have a napping box with your name inscribed on it.
141 2018-11-10 21:23:48 ERC20 is more like the stock market use case. It will be moved over to #Bitcoin though. So, if you think stocks and other securities are useful, then...
142 2018-11-10 21:23:34 Wow. How are your Stocks doing Matt?
143 2018-11-10 21:23:31 Trucks are regulated Todd in that not everyone (ex. children) can drive one since they need a license to do so, I am proposing that guns are more intelligently regulated through more stringent background checks (mental health checks), bans on bump stocks, etc.
144 2018-11-10 21:22:32 Hahah.  It will go much more slowly. First bg checks, no AR, bump stocks, etc. In the future, gun nuts may hold onto a few antiques but the mass shootings have to stop. No you can't keep them.
145 2018-11-10 21:19:46 When we stay invested in stocks, all we would be having is a handful of stocks in a year. Compared to traders, value investors will have a lot of free time and it's extremely boring

148 2018-11-10 21:15:47 They have been banned by the US before. It is time to ban them and bump stocks again.
149 2018-11-10 21:15:27 As AIM investors we have to ask ourselves what do these companies have in common that we can identify that will prevent us investing in these type of stocks in the future.
150 2018-11-10 21:13:47 I dunno, “You make doom stocks” is plausibly an article I’d pitch.
151 2018-11-10 21:13:32 1. The ad was originally done by Greenpeace and, as I understand, Iceland bought it knowing it would be banned. The original ad was to pressure supermarkets to stop using palm oil. Iceland doesn’t use palm oil in its own products but it still stocks products using palm oil.
152 2018-11-10 21:13:30 Johnny! When was the last time we saw each other? Gosh, it's been long. Mm.. Waking up early, strolling down the street in my residence to have my breakfast, then coming back home with food stocks for the whole week? Bubble bath, nice dinner.. I usually have the Sunday to myself
153 2018-11-10 21:12:01 Federal mandates against extended mags and bump stocks to start, he likely bought the extended mag in another state. Improved mental health barriers. I do not have all the answers, but to say the status quo is the best the free world can come up with is selling ourselves short.
154 2018-11-10 21:09:18 ...more like "when brands started selling stocks on StockX"... hey who else can mark down the prices like that?
155 2018-11-10 21:08:23 How many of you trade crypto? How  many of you trade stocks? Would anyone be interested in some free stocks to get you in the game? Or you could just sell them, take the money and run. Up to you, just let me know if you're interested
156 2018-11-10 21:08:10 yes, one laptop to rule them all!
157 2018-11-10 21:07:25 How? Have your stocks gone up ?
158 2018-11-10 21:05:17 Excellent thread Trish. Insulin is a key medication here. The only UK stocks are made in North Wales I believe, and a small percentage of the whole UK requirement. If someone dies of a DKA with no insulin, surely this lands at the feet of the current UK government?
159 2018-11-10 21:04:49 If you live in or near Philly and if you haven’t had a cake from Stocks Bakery what they hell are you doin with your life? BEST CAKE EVER! It’s not a birthday in my family without a Stocks cake.
160 2018-11-10 21:02:37 i am on Social Security, no stocks to speak of, savings wiped out due to helping both parents with Alzheimer. Since Trump utilities have gone up, meds have gone up, food prices have gone up and gas has gone gone up. Social Security has stayed the same
161 2018-11-10 21:02:21 i swear to god we better not have a year of people trying so fucking hard to "test" final smash meter. surely that JP tournament where like 75% of the stocks in the tournament were taken by FS should nip that in the bud
162 2018-11-10 21:01:38 Soros still made shit tons of $ before the election, remember stocks dropped after the Fed raised interest rate? Fed has the history of giving tips to its favorite fund managers.

167 2018-11-10 20:54:56 Dude don’t let emotion effect an investment, look at the long term, not day to day, it’s a solid project it’s just early days .
Crypto investments and social media don’t mix,in the old days you just checked your stocks every  so often and that was it I’m in from ico 
168 2018-11-10 20:53:44 I'd be fine if my life savings in stocks lost 75% of their value

You can play however you want and have fun!
176 2018-11-10 20:46:33 Also, when constructing a portfolio, we should be after good arithmetic mean returns in individual positions. The long term CAGR of those positions is not essential. High beta stocks having low CAGR doesn't necessarily make them bad investments as part of a portfolio.
177 2018-11-10 20:45:38 Thanks TM, looking at $ROKU it’s a technical mess below 50d and 200d.  Earnings were solid, outlook not so much.  Growth stocks been hammered lately, what’s your target to get in?  Cheers

182 2018-11-10 20:41:50 The saving grace is the GoogleFinance() function in google spreadsheet. Quite powerful to get historical data on stocks and currencies. For instance type =GOOGLEFINANCE(".INX", "open", today()-6000, today(), "Daily") to get daily prices... Also IMPORTHTML() gets 3rd party data
183 2018-11-10 20:40:31 Disagree with you. A culture does not help, but taking away certain weapons does. Look at Australia. And yes you baby bump stocks and whatever else can make a weapon fire like that. Now shoelaces never heard of that.
184 2018-11-10 20:37:54 I've tried all of them, I think they all have their faults but Melee is the one game that currently doesn't sit right with me. It's far too punishing for the most minute mistakes. Granted, I don't think movement should be restricted but you can lose stocks too easily

191 2018-11-10 20:25:44 Partly correct. Some of the money is used to pay dividends and to buy back stock. Who benefits from dividends and stock buybacks?

The rest of the money is either invested in stocks and bonds, or it is used to build and equip factories and offices. Who benefits from that?
192 2018-11-10 20:25:41 The answer isn’t to just give up and let the “bad guys” win. And frankly, the ones committing mass murders aren’t getting their bump stocks, extended clips and ARs on the black market. They are buying them legally. So to say there is nothing we can do is just not true.
193 2018-11-10 20:24:00 It also creates problems with stock rulesets. If final smashes end stocks quickly, you would up the stocks. However you then run into the problem that if someone missed a final smash, the match ends up taking too long or they are unable to make a comeback. Very problematic

195 2018-11-10 20:22:58 Man I really do suck at taking stocks :(

201 2018-11-10 20:11:55 that predicts the expected credit loss during the entire life of the loan, which will enforce banks to make better decisions in a scientific way. If they don’t implement they will be heavily fined along with bad press coverage that will effect their stocks. My point is, US banks
202 2018-11-10 20:10:59 The 'disconnect' - don't think so. Doesn't matter how high the price of Vanadium goes, it's highly probable that anyone investing in V stocks will lose their investment to phoney managements, brokers and traders.

214 2018-11-10 19:57:31 Yeah - something that works absolutely all the time has to be applied to every stock you have.

$SPY and $VIX are fine for hedging "correlations go to one" scenarios.

Some people replace all of their stocks with in-the-money LEAPS calls and put the rest of the money in bonds.
215 2018-11-10 19:57:05 I think gerrymandering and public officials owning corporate stocks while in office should be addressed more.
216 2018-11-10 19:56:48 U recomend to invest in psu banks long time back.people burnt their hard earned money in psu banks stocks,sintex also..co having low pe doesnt means its cheap.its better to buy quality co at high price rather buying junk at very low cost.

224 2018-11-10 19:48:15 The trick is buying value...not just any old stock. Stocks may fall for hundreds of reasons. But when the market mis-prices a stock that is the time to swoop in and buy. It is an art not a science.
225 2018-11-10 19:48:09 You're making it out like gun control is banning guns. The new gun control movement made in the wake of the Parkland shooting just wants universal background checks &

235 2018-11-10 19:40:04 Odd though that all the stocks are falling even though the sales and supply is maxed out. Nothing makes sense anymore but absurd manipulation.
236 2018-11-10 19:37:20 As you improve and gain confidence, you can expand into other markets... OR NOT! There’s no rule on this. Hell, many successful traders narrow their focus to 5 stocks and ignore the other 4,000.
237 2018-11-10 19:36:47 Just because you’re in the markets doesn’t mean you have to trade currencies, or metals, or bio stocks, or bonds. Simplification is never a bad idea. If you’re only comfortable with US large cap internet tech stocks from Mountain View for now, then stick with that.

240 2018-11-10 19:35:29 Think of the stock broker again, should he not charge for being your stock broker just because he could make money on stocks himself? See how the argument against paying for tips looks silly now?

Honestly - it's just the best possible way I can explain it for what it is.

244 2018-11-10 19:29:11 Get them running up To the cow and calf from the town centre tomorrow for 2 hours.  Then set some stocks up on Lowfields road with buckets of rotten tomatoes and rotten mince meat to  be hurled at them.
245 2018-11-10 19:28:45 Say you wanted to invest into stocks to make money. Unless you know what you're doing you may hire a stock broker. Someone who does know what they're doing and charges you for their knowledge and service.
Makes sense? Apply that logic to betting and people have a bug up their bum

249 2018-11-10 19:22:51 Please come home soon. We need you to ban more bump stocks and suggest we take away more guns first, and worry about due process second.
250 2018-11-10 19:22:28 Anyone else on TD Ameritrade? When I look at my stocks, the cost of $VRUS just has -- instead of the amount I bought it at ever since the ticker change. Does anyone else see the same thing?

253 2018-11-10 19:18:36 That whom'st'd arguing behind overwatch stocks ?!?   
254 2018-11-10 19:18:22 Exactly, every cooking show says to buy local produce. Tesco stocks lots of local produce. It's a non starter.
255 2018-11-10 19:18:21 I also love here stocks.
256 2018-11-10 19:15:44 Right? It’s the exact opposite.

Inflation hurts the poor, who live paycheck to paycheck, have little cash savings, and no investments.

And it helps the rich because their investments (real estate, stocks/bonds, etc.) protect their “savings” by “inflating” as well re: value.

258 2018-11-10 19:11:06 Is there any type of socks for people who feel like their stocks are suffocating them? I'm so irritated at the fact of knowing that I am wearing them however it is very cold so it's necessary I guess.
259 2018-11-10 19:11:05 From our experience it is obvious that stocks of property-related companies thrive during property booms. This include stocks of housebuilders, estate agencies, property websites and  retailer of household furnishings.

274 2018-11-10 18:51:48 Yes, it is.  Taxes the first dollar, but if you're fortunate to make enough, not the last.  And it only applies to earned income so guys like Warren Buffet who make their money trading in stocks don't have to pay it.  It's why his secretary has a higher effective rate.

284 2018-11-10 18:46:16 4/ Bump stocks, extended magazines and so-called pistol forearm braces are examples of accessories that up the lethality and firepower of weapons they modify. In this shooting, the pistol was designed with a 13 round magazine. The shooter fired it with a 26 round magazine.

298 2018-11-10 18:37:58 Why Retail Investor Loose money in the Market. 
In the #Bull Market they keep on buying poor and good quality stocks at high value. Then when bubble of Bull Market bust they wont to exit their position as they were in loss.
299 2018-11-10 18:37:03 And we used printing presses for our newspaper no internet is that the route we should take? Bump stocks are gimmicks and high capacity magazine bans mean nothing to a deranged shooter example being the Thousand Oaks shooter high capacity mags have been outlawed since 2016

318 2018-11-10 18:19:26 Remember, universal background checks, bump stocks, and high capacity magazines/military variant rifles with tough felony sentences.

otherwise 1 bad stock can end ur ecomnic state
337 2018-11-10 17:57:53 To be honest, I try to stay away from CSE stocks unless they are US MJ (they can only list on CSE). The inability to have stop losses is a big reason, they tend to be illiquid, and more likely to be subject to manipulation from groups of investors. Just my opinion anyways

my budget and my savings are possible because the banks in my country offers me a safety

and 
ofc if you live in usa or any other country 
go for stocks but i wouldn't trust stocks.

It takes a little bad day and you could lose a lot in the investment
344 2018-11-10 17:52:19 Let me cut to the chase:
I don’t think citizens should have more powerful weapons than law enforcement does.
I don’t think bump stocks should be allowed.
I think those who want these kinds of weapons should be licensed to have them.
It’s against the law to even study this, why?
345 2018-11-10 17:51:11 Actually luv, if you consider their stocks dropped by 10% and sales continue to fall. They altered the company to such a degree, even I was turned off.

385 2018-11-10 17:08:54 It does. You refuse to buy it and that’s ok. Many are still doing it. In fact many are doing it online these days, writing blogs, recording videos, providing advice, trading stocks, selling products. So it is up to the individual to plan their own life.
386 2018-11-10 17:08:29 It's hard If Some fan base buy stocks on SM. We might hurt them.  Like what happen to Henry.  I'm afraid those solo Stan's. I'm afraid that Lay can't join to his members because of OT8 Stan's.  It's complicated.

389 2018-11-10 17:03:48 They banned bump stocks which was used in the Vegas shooting, and they tried to remove gun free zones since that's where 90% of shootings take place. They just got shut down by the left. Can't say they weren't doing nothing. Just not what you want to do.

What is so crazy about background checks for anyone that wants to buy gun, where ever they buy it from. What is so crazy about criminalizing bump stocks! NOTHING!
400 2018-11-10 16:55:47 No! Millennials Trebucheted My Blue Chip Stocks !!
401 2018-11-10 16:54:08 I’ve thought about it but I think I’m too late to the game to make bucks. I really should’ve bought stocks in soap back when it was just a sad Christmas gift
402 2018-11-10 16:53:45 Well, conflict of interest I’m not agreeing with, but CFD’s have their problems and risk. But risk is inherent even when trading stocks, whether on margin or not.
403 2018-11-10 16:52:58 Most adult, least dumb bitch thing I’m gonna say all week. Real talk- politics just fucked my investments so hard from last month to this month every single one of my stocks and investments took a hit and went DOWN. I blame the orange guy!!! That is all.
404 2018-11-10 16:52:55 TRUMP: "bump stocks are going to be gone." March 8, 2018.

That was 8 months ago. This is the same president that implements bad policy at lightning speed, but this common-sense measure is always just over the next horizon. In that time, 10 states banned them. #VegasStrong
405 2018-11-10 16:50:57 Love Canadians...would love to defect...my cousin did in the 70svand is now a reporter for a Toronto newspaper.  only thing there she considers bad is the price of shampoo and things like that and stocks up when She comes  to visit us.  I love the cold weather too!
406 2018-11-10 16:50:51 One caveat: (haven't read the note yet but hey) higher volatility and bigger intraday moves could just signal less liquidity vs an outright bear turn. 

Also, growth is not negative for equities - but interest rates sure are. Curve steepening is generally not good for stocks?

417 2018-11-10 16:46:47 A reminder as to why I like to make fun of @TheyCallMeDSP is that he's one of the laughing stocks of the internet.   A rebuttal that a fan of his once gave me was 'At least, he's not as bad as Chris-Chan'.  
That's like saying 'One sword in your face isn't as bad as two swords'

427 2018-11-10 16:34:59 That’s why you don’t buy stocks in a downtrend.
428 2018-11-10 16:32:48 You are absolutely correct..But if I play devil's advocate here...in a bull market pe does not matter...ex Amazon , Tesla, Netflix...if we started rationalizing things by pe...you cannot participate in any bull market ...coz every bull market has its share of overvalued stocks

435 2018-11-10 16:28:42 @RepRaskin Time to push for gun control legislation again: comprehensive background checks, gun safety research, and ban on assault weapons and bump stocks. Please don't give up on this! We're becoming immune to mass shootings. Thank you.
436 2018-11-10 16:28:39 A handgun was used in the California shooting. Bump stocks are banned in CA and assault weapons are highly regulated there. Extended magazine? Next monster brings two smaller mags or two guns. Stay away from the #2A and look for a real solution.

447 2018-11-10 16:18:30 Yeah, big down moves typically result in varied underlyings become more correlated with each other. 

But a high correlation between 2 stocks doesn't translate to correlation of returns with #MOVERS.

We have different returns profiles between $NIFTY & $BANKNIFTY even.
448 2018-11-10 16:18:16 Better to exit stocks and sectors that he suggests. I bought infy and heg last year and sitting with 60% profit while he suggested stocks like gvk that have eroded investor wealth by 50℅.

453 2018-11-10 16:15:34 Yes, but the V story has the potential to move UUUU, Western, and UEC quite a bit more than today.  TiO2 could also propell UEC even more than V if all goes right.  To me it is most telling looking at the U, V and T stocks and see where they are compared to their 52 wk lows.
454 2018-11-10 16:15:27 Booo @LazadaPH all your Hauwei piso items are out of stocks at exactly 12midnight. Will never fall for promo sale gimmicks like this ever.

457 2018-11-10 16:14:42 I am on board with sensible gun control like clip size limited to 10 shots, no bump stocks, a tax on gun sales on same percentage as alcohol. None of that would have prevented the CA shooting

463 2018-11-10 16:09:15 This is the kind of stuff that worries me. Rampant speculation. The general prices of housing and stocks are based on the idea that 2+2=5, even though it's exactly the mentality that got us in the 2008 crisis.

472 2018-11-10 16:03:33 Essentially what I am trying to do as well much of the year.  More like 100/30 right now, but this changes. Requires an activist approach for sure.

500 2018-11-10 15:41:26 Best thing about commonsense gun safety is that there are ways to solve gun violence without confiscating guns. Storage & holstering laws. Ban extended clips & bump stocks. Universal background checks. We can agree guns aren't the problem. Lack of sense in our laws is the problem

511 2018-11-10 15:35:28 Let's focus Donald. My stocks aren't looking so great right now, wages aren't rising, some ahole in Washington is trying to take away healthcare, there's a national emergency surrounding fire arms,  and you're being investigated for crimes I'm pretty site you've committed.
512 2018-11-10 15:32:42 And now the AAA publishers have created their own problem. They saw such huge gains that they cant create growth any longer. Stocks and shares and returns are down because they hinge so strongly on year over year growth
513 2018-11-10 15:31:49 Yep - a feeble bounce, to be sure. Some stocks already rolled lower this week: $TTWO, $NFLX, shortable gap-downs in $SQ, $ROKU, $ATVI... More LSAs looking like they might be setting up as well...

522 2018-11-10 15:24:10 I believe what I see. And with Republicans I see results.I see an economy humming I see a strong military, cracking down on the boarder, lowest unemployment across the board. Record breaking stocks rising new trade deals and destroyed isis. Trump leads by example

524 2018-11-10 15:21:53 Ownership is key. 

When Yung Miami said “fuck that Netflix & Chill, what’s your net worth?” I felt that on another level.

In our community, most of us don’t own shit of value. I’m not talking about clothes, jewelry & cars. I’m talking about home/land, stocks, & investments.
525 2018-11-10 15:21:51 Cube stocks should be down again because of this shit, I hope CLC get out of that shitty ass company and find another company who really cares about promoting them 'good enough'

534 2018-11-10 15:12:08 Can options be traded using candle stick pattern and can we use the same chart setup as in stocks?
535 2018-11-10 15:11:25 Being knowledgeable with your background and expertise, how do you invest knowing what you do? What do you buy, do you invest in real estate, gold or silver, dividend funds, stocks, bonds or do you have someone that does it all for you? Do you invest under a trust?

536 2018-11-10 15:11:10 Here's a value spread outside of materials -- that finally might work:  
I consider stocks like NFLX -- the valuation ridiculous.  Like Tesla. No competition. 
I like DIS push into streaming. Think they mean it. 
Long DIS short NFLX makes sense. Market agnostic.
537 2018-11-10 15:07:49 We appreciate your interest for Bullets wireless. The last sale for OnePlus Bullets wireless was on 6th November. Due to huge demand the Bullets wireless is out of stock again. We are constantly working towards bringing more and more stocks for our users.
538 2018-11-10 15:06:56 1:Trump is forcing the recession so he can pick up property and stocks dirt cheap.
2:Donny Jr might be indicted.
3:Impeachment is expensive and time consuming. Just stop the worst of his behavior unless we have enough for criminal charges of Treason and Obstruction.
539 2018-11-10 15:06:52 There are background checks. My 3D printer can make 25-100 round mags a day. It’s a box and a spring. And bump stocks are equal to a belt loop and bungee cord. “Assault rifles” are not a real class of gun. And handguns kill over 10x the amount of people rifles do.

544 2018-11-10 15:02:59 Market focus suddenly changed from IT, Pharma n FMCG to attractive PSB's, PSU's, beaten down high dividend yield stocks like REC, PFC, KTK Bank n other neglected sectors due to falling in crude oil price, weakening dollar price vs too high valuations of IT, Pharma n FMCG sectors.
545 2018-11-10 15:02:54 Obama had an F Rating with the NRA and Democrats had complete control of house/senate. What gun control legislation was passed during his time in office? The Obama Administration also approved bump stocks TWICE! Bump stocks were used in the Vegas shooting. NRA & Trump oppose them

548 2018-11-10 15:01:01 Yeah which is why they used their tax cut money to buy back their own stocks to artificially drive up it's value.... Why not try doing research instead of just repeating what your used car salesmen representatives tell you?

559 2018-11-10 14:53:43 Great thread.  It’s important to consider actual use cases when picking names.  I grabbed STOCKS and COA for this very reason - they can be utilized effectively with sub-assets for specific and understandable purposes.

Semi-automatics
High-capacity magazines
High-powered rifles
Bump stocks

Take any of those factors away, and casualties are reduced. Take all of them away, and the terrorist has to expend far more effort to kill even one person.

568 2018-11-10 14:44:51 I’d be curious to know how many Democrats own gun and ammo stocks. They would be making a killing every time they call for more gun control and then people run out and buy more guns and ammo.

581 2018-11-10 14:31:50 Until you stop accepting NRA checks and start doing something about gun control, you have changed nothing, @RodneyDavis.

In the time that it took you to not research bump stocks (like you said you would, #IL13 remembers), this man was the victim of a second mass shooting.

599 2018-11-10 14:13:20 So now that I look at it, Activision-Blizzard has been bleeding in stock since mid-October (30-40%). I think they tried to announce Diablo Immortal (early) at a big event to try to get stocks up, which backfired badly due to core reaction. I think they may be in trouble.

629 2018-11-10 13:38:34 Hi Gregory, just to clarify, the stock is going down next week? Should we keep our stocks or sell them?
630 2018-11-10 13:37:03 Which is meaningless.  Just keep dropping under performing industrials and bellwether stocks and replacing them with trendy well performing stocks and it can be at a million.

633 2018-11-10 13:34:00 A positive thread. Great idea! For me, I've soaring from the extra fall-back hour we gained last weekend. Awake super-early all week, baking, making soup stocks, enjoying the peace and quiet of the wee hours.  Nice to read everyone's tweets on this thread. 
634 2018-11-10 13:32:50 Took quite a hit yesterday. I guess another of those Stocks where the Valuation had got nudged up and up and up and finally there are no Buyers prepared to pay up. Seems very good business though.  #ACSO
635 2018-11-10 13:32:11 Often overlooked: stocks are a great inflation hedge for Americans.
636 2018-11-10 13:31:59 And no illegal add-ons like bump stocks.
637 2018-11-10 13:31:31 Yes, those are the people worried about their stocks and investments.  It is amazing how the trailer crowd actually believe Trump is for them. SMDH

643 2018-11-10 13:30:05 That’s the thing, we won’t get them all right but that’s the nature of any gamble whether traditional bet or stocks etc. Missed on gacinovic, took a 10p rise on a small amount rather than jumping on and riding to where he is now
644 2018-11-10 13:27:09 There are 3 kinds of Stocks, money can be made in all three of them.. 

1) A Good Business Model in a Good Time (Get your Valuation Right here)

2) A Good Business Model in a Bad time (Being Patient is Important)

3) A Bad Business Model in a Good time (Remember to Exit Well)
645 2018-11-10 13:25:20 Why is that a bad thing? M&A is good for acquired stocks/other strong companies will join the index and replace them. I'll take that.
646 2018-11-10 13:23:15 Don't worry my man I'm good just tryna make more and already invested in stocks so I understand all that ish they was preachin when I was 16 just gotta listen when old folk b teachin ya stuff!!!

648 2018-11-10 13:22:33 neat thought - 
Investing in good companies is easy for me, because I am not a fund manager and not managing others money. Once I am invested in whatever stocks I am invested in, I have to learn to do nothing. For my core portfolio, 5 or 10 companies are enough - @VijayKedia1
649 2018-11-10 13:21:38 Yeah it's looking weak again. So many Stocks that have tried to rise have been beaten back again. Yesterday looks a very ropey day all round but need to see how Monday plays out because Friday is often 'weird'  #SMDS

657 2018-11-10 13:09:19 Achieving big returns consistently is more about risk control than finding big winning stocks. Until you understand and put into practice the concept I call "incremental risk taking", you will experience excessive drawdowns that undermine your performance.
658 2018-11-10 13:05:58 Which broker are you using to trade stocks?

660 2018-11-10 13:05:00 Small account challenge and sizing down are 2 very different things.

One is someone using a $500 account and his sheep to pump stocks to 1500 chatroom members with alerts

I didnt scale down my account. I scaled down my SHARE SIZE

Here is the best part... I DONT ALERT ANYTHING

671 2018-11-10 12:55:03 @aplusk, gun reform isn't needed. There are more than enough laws on the books. Problem is the prosecution wont enforce them. That's why Congress never adds a "new" unless it's for something not covered...i.e. bump stocks. Be better to focus on getting enforcement done.

721 2018-11-10 11:39:41 Regular sane people would still have access as they did with the possible exceptions of AR-15’s and bump-stocks of course. It’s the NRA who’ve put it in people’s heads that “they” are coming for your guns. That’s simply not true.

732 2018-11-10 11:30:15 Lastly 

Reasons why it’s the safest:

1. No market crash (stocks)
2. No recession (real estate)
3. No bear market (crypto)
4. It is based on human behavior that is backed by data i.e. pace of game, possessions per game
5. It is not controlled by “whales”
6. It is not news driven
733 2018-11-10 11:30:09 4/ Anyways, great listen and keep it up!

I have to admit, I really enjoyed the start of the episode. I couldn't stop laughing about the "pain" discussions, as some investments (like stocks) have consolidated and corrected slightly.

In such case, better to have a readymade list of quality stocks with price points to enter..ofcourse goof fundamentals, the companies which will survive evenif Raga comes or Mamta or Maya or even Kejri..do not listen to media, listen to your own analysis & past mkt information

771 2018-11-10 10:36:12 @Spartacus did you invested in any stocks?
772 2018-11-10 10:28:53 Wow you bought one? Good that they are not out of stocks
773 2018-11-10 10:28:24 It's the NoBull range - I highly recommend the original nobull burger and the meatballs not so much the chicken patties or paella. But Iceland also stocks Fry's chicken nuggets and chicken burgers - worth giving it a try if you like chicken. Let me know if you have any questions!

793 2018-11-10 09:55:49 I’m not sure it’s something I’ll be embracing anytime soon,  can I suggest you stick to the sausages for demonstration purposes!
794 2018-11-10 09:54:32 Great but just add not sure if your entire portfolio was in these 4 stocks but if yes pls do use position sizing techniques to limit risk in 1 position to a Max of 2% of capital

Have yet to fully grasp how this helps on the upside but helps immensely minimise risk on downside

798 2018-11-10 09:49:57 These are not true pensions. They are investments in the stock market that are tied to a person's retirment. Big difference. When the stock market takes a dive, anyone invested in the stocks taking a hit loses chunks of their retirement. 13/?

802 2018-11-10 09:47:02 Swimming Enclosures will fix it and stop box jellyfish stings if they use right mesh. Food and fish waste being dumped needs to be stopped. Sharks are a good sign of fish stocks aside.

804 2018-11-10 09:42:51 This time last year it was Tencent the first Asian company to be worth half-a-trillion dollars. It has since shed $218bn. Other Chinese internet stocks have fared worse.
805 2018-11-10 09:40:51 Trust me, even with ELF buying some stocks, the treatment didn't change. ELF bought stocks when SuJu is still new, but even after that, the promotions and other stuff are still the same.. So, as an ELF, I dont recommend it.

809 2018-11-10 09:37:38 I'm certainly glad I invested.  I put in 8,000, picked stocks for growth.  It got up to around 96,000 by 08, when it dropped to below my original 8,000. I went into shock. But at that point I had to hang on, what else was there. By 2016 under Obama  my investments rose to 99,000
810 2018-11-10 09:36:29 I will sell that house and buy blue Chip stocks, earn dividend income and settle in a peaceful tier 3 city
811 2018-11-10 09:36:15 I'd start with banning bump stocks, then background checks universally. I'd STOP making fun of the other side, because that gets us no where.

813 2018-11-10 09:33:43 There are reports in the south of Spain that some pharmacies cannot get their normal supplies, because of extra stocks being bought up by British pharmacies in advance of brexit.
814 2018-11-10 09:32:52 Buying high priced stocks is always risky
815 2018-11-10 09:32:24 On the subject of TVs are Black Friday deals a con? Currys ran a LG TV promotion and it was obvious to me they had no where near enough stocks to back up the advertised deals.Not long after the deal had ended they had the TVs back in stock but of course at a much higher price .

900 2018-11-10 07:40:34 Jeffrey Archer's books always make it seem like gaining profits from stock investments and/or developing your own enterprise from scratch is so easy

Reading them motivates me to try something crazy like idk, invest my meager savings and buy some stocks??

902 2018-11-10 07:40:02 Il est normal que le déficit explose avec les américains sur les derniers mois. La distribution importe à fond pour faire des stocks avant la mise en place des sanctions.

904 2018-11-10 07:38:41 First open a brokerage acct like Fidelity, Ameritrade, Ally... check out the fees for buying/ selling.  Research, invest in sector etf’s, or  SPY, QQQ, DDM, or stocks and learn to place stop losses on each position. Market is still cautiously bullish.
905 2018-11-10 07:37:10 The only solution I can think of here is, us buying SM's stocks, that way they'll listen to us whether they like it or not.

Most of the tax cuts went to the rich...but good for you if your check went up. Stocks.better under O in his first yr and this 2nd yr a week ago had no gains at all

930 2018-11-10 06:49:19 Share price won't go to zero if it has some exposure to ILFS. For all these stocks IFLS exposure is just 1-2 months of profit. But if you bought such bonds directly, then your whole investment has potential to become junk.
931 2018-11-10 06:48:54 Can't you just buy back in when the stocks seem to stabilize? Figure they will rebound in about 2 months.

940 2018-11-10 06:23:33 Agreed hourly plus amount of people working. But that is not the money that flows in to stocks. Perhaps it is better to look at the amount of profit savings better sitting idle which actually does get pumped into stocks bonds etc.. rather Joe income hourly earnings.
941 2018-11-10 06:22:17 Trees growing outward & upward, cherished and mutually rewarding friendships & relationships, quality assets held with a focus on the long term (stocks, bonds, real assets, startups, etc.), good books, intriguing blog posts, thought provoking tweets...

945 2018-11-10 06:14:47 bcs they usually place the old stock infront so that customer will buy them. if cust only take the back ones, then there will be left only the old stocks. if this continues, people wont buy the front one, it’ll expire then the store will suffer a loss.
946 2018-11-10 06:13:52 Comprehending The Economist has been lifechanging for me. I try to stay away from not-so-great. For me, reading “what” is like buying stocks. You buy high quality at a good price, stick with it and keep gaining from it.

961 2018-11-10 05:59:31 And sticks and tasers bro, don't forget the sticks and tasers. But no bump stocks on the tasers, its inhumane.
962 2018-11-10 05:58:17 Well they’re frequently used in mass shootings. And bump stocks are legal in many states. So it’s easy in the USA to turn  your easily purchased semi into an automatic. That’s not the case in Switzerland. SMH
963 2018-11-10 05:55:43 Still no "earnings recession" like in 2015/2016.

971 2018-11-10 05:42:52 Bump stocks, high capacity magazines need to be banned.  Make it easier to be removed/denied to those with mental health/PSTD issues.
972 2018-11-10 05:42:51 Was pretty tough watching all my swings go into the red yesterday! Two weeks ago, i would have panic sold, but trusting the strategy, i scaled in to reduce my dca.

973 2018-11-10 05:40:43 but i believe (heol) SM won't risk any dating scandals for EXO tho. Company usually prefers within the company dating but now they won't risk it. 
unless they're that desperate. coz it affects other female group + stocks

980 2018-11-10 05:19:31 Wanting stricter gun laws isn’t anti gun. That’s gun nut propaganda. Most people aren’t against gun ownership, just want to see limits on number of guns & want military grade weapons/bump stocks outlawed. It’s pretty reasonable.

989 2018-11-10 05:11:05 But it should not include stock market as it is not held domestically nor is it even relevant to overall health of the economy. The higher it goes the less wealth the general population holds. Stocks are held by a very small section of society.

1003 2018-11-10 04:44:42 No I don't agree. If we buy stocks we will start thinking we have control over EXO's career. I don't want the same thing that happen to Super Junior happens to EXO. The members probably won't be able to date or get married at all because of how immature fans can be.
1004 2018-11-10 04:44:39 Am stocks dropping lol.. see dat happens when they don't promote their money makers well
1005 2018-11-10 04:44:25 Housing stocks plummeted because there was no stock. How many new builds happened? You also need to remember who's in government now, blaming a previous @UKLabour government is petty and just point scoring. You should be complaining about the incumbent government.

1007 2018-11-10 04:35:42 all the big 4 or 5 US tech stocks are in a downturn. check them. If they lose the monthly lows, they are going to plummet. They make up between 30 & 40% of the US stock markets. when they tumble, shit is going to splatter. Everywhere. The highs have been had.
1008 2018-11-10 04:28:50 Euro Stoxx and the DAX have been ugly. Next week we will see German ZEW, German GDP, and EZ GDP. In short, a big week for the euro. A lot of long-term support in Stoxx 50 around 3012 +- 5 handles. If that breaks, that’s not gonna help US stocks return to highs

1011 2018-11-10 04:24:27 How would you profit from $nvda in this situation? Short term hold with size or small size long term (months) investment thru earnings? Curious because I like the idea of having a portfolio of growth stocks and options. But i dont like holding options long term
1012 2018-11-10 04:22:06 REMINDER
Mitch McConnell once said that there isn't much that the Federal Government can to to help reduce Mass Shootings.

Here's a list:
- Strict background checks
- Ban Bump Stocks and assault-style rifles
- Increase age limit to purchase all guns/ammo
- VOTE OUT McConnell!
1013 2018-11-10 04:22:04 But avg wages grew 3%! Hmm that is what .60 cents an hour on a $20 an hour wage. So raise prime rates everyone can afford BMWs & penthouses now. What a joke. Cos.are making record profits. Tax breaks but back stocks not hire workers...

1028 2018-11-10 03:57:31 I'm good with banning assault style guns...  there is no useful reason for them aside from what mass shooters use them for. Same as large capacity magazines, bump stocks, silencers... all feed into our country's gun violence fetish, and therefore, glamorized.

1037 2018-11-10 03:45:01 Yup. Especially this week. I bet stocks went under for antacid and alcohol 
1038 2018-11-10 03:43:28 Except we can't even get bump stocks banned, a year after Las Vegas now. That's not going to make real progress towards stopping mass shootings here, but we can't even get something as stupid simple as that.

1045 2018-11-10 03:37:30 I would think the accuracy of a model on stocks should be easily falsifiable. Just backtest using buy/sell signals from the model, yes?

Side note--Jeremiah have you seen any classes of models which you think are helpful in stock price prediction?
1046 2018-11-10 03:36:59 Besides the tech pullback, no. Our companies rebuying their stocks and banks taking in money did that. Both are signs of a strengthening economy.
1047 2018-11-10 03:36:10 Maybe you should look at our oil price, stocks, job market, MILITARY, our Veterans just to name a few. Then go take a serious look at the Democrat run cities like Chicago, Detroit pick any in California, Cleveland, New York City. Drugs, gangs, illegal weapons and murder

1053 2018-11-10 03:28:45 One more thing - I don't disagree with Trump just because he's Trump. I supported his push to ban bump stocks on guns after the Parkland FL shooting, and I agreed with his view on assault weapons and raising the age limit, though this hasn't translated to an executive decision.
1054 2018-11-10 03:25:33 I think its because domestic investors are pouring in so much money that FIIs find stocks super fed and ripe for sell. The US rate hike is ofcourse a reason as well.

Logic: making semi-automatic rifles with bump stocks that allow them to function as if fully automatic, and high capacity magazines readily available allows them to be purchased or stolen by people who will use them to commit mass shootings.

1069 2018-11-10 03:01:18 The only thing that will work and be agreed upon is reasonable changes that will actually keep weapons out of the hands of folks who would do this.
Banning ALL weapons is overboard.
Banning just bump stocks is way too little.Focus should start with background checks &registration

1134 2018-11-10 01:56:27 @Remurdy if ur still learning stuff about stocks an all what are using ? Just curious bc I wanna do the same  just doing it before college . If u still are
1135 2018-11-10 01:56:22 There are indeed times when I will not take seriously arguments from individuals who lack knowledge of the topic on which they are speaking. I always take the person seriously, but not their reasoning. Would you take advice from a 2-year-old telling you what stocks to invest in?
1136 2018-11-10 01:50:05 Great bounce this week after a wild October.  Not sure all of the pain is over just yet but I'm curious to know how everyone else feels? #markets #economy #stocks #trading
1137 2018-11-10 01:49:57 Yes, I like to day trade but I'm on robinhood and I can only do 3 a week, but how do you know what stocks to day trade? Or is it really just a guess
1138 2018-11-10 01:49:07 In positive news, I did get things done this week that needed to be done. I should buy stocks in Lyft. Most of my money is going to them. I should get special discounts or something at this rate.
1139 2018-11-10 01:49:05 We all “own” most of these large corps. It’s called stocks. When we the people stop expecting a whatever $10 vs $5 dividend monthly check on investment, we can complain. Those of us that literally rose from $20k to $60k without College degrees know it’s possible with work. Choice

1141 2018-11-10 01:44:34 On one hand, what RB preaches is spot one - long term investing, compounding, buying USA & finding great companies. On the other hand, he seems to leave out the risk & realities of bear mkts, the short term nature of most investors & that its hard to find grt growth stocks. Push.
1142 2018-11-10 01:44:27 how many stocks will you get? I’ll donate 
1143 2018-11-10 01:44:06 and yet some charge that the MBA's are too big and too huge for their own good and yet Reggie knew something even Skip Rutherford Trump failed to appreciate and that was stocks and bonds and trading was one thing and yet the key and salient point was that the traders born bore 19
1144 2018-11-10 01:42:04 no one's doing anything about controlling the distribution of guns and their regulations (the marine also had something like bump stocks that was illegal) IN ADDITION to the lack of action towards helping the mentally unstable. this is shit on top of shit
1145 2018-11-10 01:40:58 I gotta narrow down to like 3-3 stocks.

1148 2018-11-10 01:37:19 The fact that stocks are nonstationary nonergodic processes pretty much negates the two.
1149 2018-11-10 01:37:15 You know nothing about the markets....don’t need pot stocks to make money in the market...for every pot stock you find I’ll find five that will perform or outperform your pot stocks #DontBeLazy
1150 2018-11-10 01:37:03 Thanks. So far looks like Lively is slightly better. Trying to see if there is something that i can be all invested in stocks and only pay the trading cost and avoid the monthly fee. Doesn't appear to exist.

1157 2018-11-10 01:30:22 The dispersion in crypto returns have really plummeted, that’s my opportunity set. Put it in my equity portfolios today (large and small cap which both outperformed) we had double digit up and down stocks. Crypto I’m lucky to get a whole percent either way

1159 2018-11-10 01:28:41 so true.....the FANG stocks were down 35%, 30%, 35%, 20% from their 2018 highs......that's a bear market that seems to have ended Oct.30......

1168 2018-11-10 01:15:59 The Bond markets are closed on Monday in observance of Veterans Day. Stocks are open and will undergo a normal trading session.
1169 2018-11-10 01:15:54 As the week comes to an end, Mortgage Bonds holding gains. Stocks lower. 10-yr yield 3.18%.
1170 2018-11-10 01:15:19 Day 9 of No Nut November has been eventful. I have the power to control minds which I’ve used to acquire multiple “Free Nut” coupons (I won’t use them of course) I traded them for multiple shares in valuable stocks and bonds. I also have channeled my strength to lift automobiles
1171 2018-11-10 01:14:00 Stocks went down or some shit like that, so they went extra hard with the Targeting after that. That's why Amoral goes crazy. I reveal the fraud - gets upset. Confess my own sins - gets upset. Reveal about CIA involvement - gets upset. Fucks with her money.
1172 2018-11-10 01:13:57 @realDonaldTrump Hi again. Just a friendly reminder to really keep all of the negative comments to yourself. We aren't in the clear yet with the stocks. Doesn't matter who it is, or what you're saying, just keep it rosy and positive only. No making waves until stocks are better.
1173 2018-11-10 01:13:54 I keep hearing bear market. Maybe some stocks are in bear territory. But many at 52wk and ATH. That’s not a bear market. I think they use the term for agendas at times. We went way to far, needed a pullback.  That’s my 2 cents. Simple. #GoodFriday Robbie
1174 2018-11-10 01:13:30 What I love about this is the disconnect that privilege has about middle class or lower class. We don’t all have savings or 401k, stocks etc like the rich. Money goes towards food, rent, child care etc. I doubt the rich will ever see that fact or better yet try to live it
1175 2018-11-10 01:13:30 Your blessings are so comforting like your insights on stocks.

1180 2018-11-10 01:05:08 Seems like all characters have a lot of kill potential. I think we will stay at 3 stocks. Maybe go up to 4. But DEFINITELY not back to 2 imo.

1186 2018-11-10 00:57:43 totally agree.  URA was a great trading vehicle prior to the changes.  Just so happens that the relationship with U stocks looks very similar.  Not endorsing URA.  #FCUUF #LMRXF #DNN #NXE #CCJ #GVXXF #UEXCF

1196 2018-11-10 00:48:05 Pls remember ura rebalanced and now 55% of the fund is korean and Japanese construction cos.  Looking at a simple chart without understanding it’s really not uranium and u will get killed. Buy individual stocks. Ura is a mess
1197 2018-11-10 00:47:45 I can see Syco’s stocks going down
1198 2018-11-10 00:46:01 If a stock gets split, then they would adjust the overall divisor so that the split itself wouldn't collapse the Dow.  However, then the stock itself would affect the Dow less due to the lower price relative to all the other stocks.   Is that correct?
1199 2018-11-10 00:45:27 Why not switch your allegiance to stocks and shares then? Just support BP, you’ll get exactly the same level of enjoyment.
1200 2018-11-10 00:45:04 Chinese stocks are dog fleas right now.  Rather short them
1201 2018-11-10 00:44:30 Yes I think it's a hangover from the Co/Li boom bust cycles. I think V is a more structural shift though. If high prices (>$20-25/lb) persist for 6-12 months stocks will catch up imo. Q is, who is patient enough to still be there?
1202 2018-11-10 00:44:24 I cancelled my NRA membership several months ago, although I still support the 2nd amend, but we don’t need assault rifles, bump stocks, high round magazines. We need better background checks. WA state just passed a 10 day waiting period to purchase guns, that’s a start
1203 2018-11-10 00:43:57 @Izzy_S probly jumping on shippers and pot stocks temporarily I know I did and plan on a return asap when done
1204 2018-11-10 00:43:50 guess that exposed GFNTE as highly or solely dependent on fees (other financial stocks suffered less). I wonder if the stock can reach again a price of 130+ without a change in the business strategy.
1205 2018-11-10 00:43:42 We coppin stocks now

1209 2018-11-10 00:41:33 I used to keep the annual investors guide - it always showed the Bubbles on the cover Internet stocks in 90s, real estate in 06 gold etc.. loved showing this to clients - also liked the year the had Enron in the stocks to retire on.

1220 2018-11-10 00:30:24 If oil declines, gas prices decline, allowing holiday shoppers to buy more; stocks of retailers increase, with more retailers having a black Friday. Banks benefit from the interest on the credit card charges.
1221 2018-11-10 00:30:16 We don’t regulate guns enough. The extended mag the shooter used should have been illegal. Bump stocks should be illegal. Long range guns should be illegal. They are not. You jumped into a thread where someone comepared banning guns to banning knives.
1222 2018-11-10 00:30:11 Buenas tardes, será necesario que acudas directamente a la sucursal de tu preferencia ya que los stocks no se visualizan en tiempo real, puede ser probable que si indico un número y cuando llegues a la tienda ya no haya, entonces se recomienda asistir directamente. :)

1227 2018-11-10 00:24:35 Marx talked about ownership of the means of production

you don't need to say "in a modern context this means CEOs," as that's just reductive

stocks and not titles are what determine this, even if there are rough correlations between some titles and ownership
1228 2018-11-10 00:24:08 WSJ uses manipulation tactics by exaggerating company news to create buyers or sellers of stocks they are trading against. Boy do they pick some convenient levels to do that stuff too. WSJ is doing illegal shit all the time. If anyone needs investigating, it's them.
1229 2018-11-10 00:23:02 @sdmoores Simon guess this proves your point 110%. Little correlation between stocks value and demand/pricing.
1230 2018-11-10 00:22:19 The majority of Republican support things like background checks, limiting clip size, banning bump stocks

 all poll & study data is slanted by how you ask questions, but actual academic research on the topics often disagree with the biased partisan responses on bad polling /2
1231 2018-11-10 00:22:07 ...it went down another 12% today despite beating earnings expectations. Stocks are weird, man.

1233 2018-11-10 00:21:09 Not to discredit sir Griffith’s efforts but often times once cartels have an agreement with a country’s government the press plays an important role in maintaining the public satisfied.. those headlines could easily be sacrificial stocks 
1234 2018-11-10 00:19:16 NEW YORK, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Stocks around the globe sufferedtheir biggest drop in two weeks on Friday as weak Chineseeconomic data sapped demand for equities while oil pricesweakened again on Friday

Not the one off person with a gun protecting themselves but AR-15’s, huge magazines and bump stocks need to be illegal. Let us know when you become docs.

1242 2018-11-10 00:01:52 @ericjackson I miss your articles on stocks, are you writing anymore?
1243 2018-11-10 00:01:43 Just curious. You are mega bearish stocks but you have many open long positions deep in the red. Your portfolio does not match what you preach

1245 2018-11-11 23:59:11 @CypressTrades @LoseLooselookitup I use many of the inversion stocks to make swing trades. I'm using $SPXS right now.
1246 2018-11-11 23:56:53 IMO Global crisis won't help anyone. I don't think people will start buying crypto considered as one of the most risky asset when stocks, real estate and other more conservative investments will be going down.

1250 2018-11-11 23:49:58 I say this as a compliment. You think too rationally. If we are nearing the end of this cycle, price can get to absurd levels at the top. While stocks have become pricey at times, they have not become absurdly priced as stimulus has propped up #earnings & cash flows.
1251 2018-11-11 23:48:46 Having no debt allows me to buy assets like stocks and or rental properties. Debt is not good period
1252 2018-11-11 23:47:16 Pretty sure even if you buy a stock on Monday and sell on Tuesday and you do this with multiple stocks for most of the year they will consider it Day trading. If it takes your time they can easily consider it as work. If they are actually looking at you obviously.

1262 2018-11-11 23:59:11 @CypressTrades @LoseLooselookitup I use many of the inversion stocks to make swing trades. I'm using $SPXS right now.
1263 2018-11-11 23:56:53 IMO Global crisis won't help anyone. I don't think people will start buying crypto considered as one of the most risky asset when stocks, real estate and other more conservative investments will be going down.
1264 2018-11-11 23:56:28 What’s are the experts saying for this week? Pot stocks sink or raise?
1265 2018-11-11 23:55:32 Stackin penny stocks while I’m flipping these birds
1266 2018-11-11 23:55:03 today one of the servers was telling a customer that it wasnt fair that she stocks up before she leaves and the next day she has to restock bc ppl take it and the customers 3 year old tells the server “life isnt fair” lmaoo lil man has had enough
1267 2018-11-11 23:49:58 I say this as a compliment. You think too rationally. If we are nearing the end of this cycle, price can get to absurd levels at the top. While stocks have become pricey at times, they have not become absurdly priced as stimulus has propped up #earnings & cash flows.
1268 2018-11-11 23:48:46 Having no debt allows me to buy assets like stocks and or rental properties. Debt is not good period
1269 2018-11-11 23:47:16 Pretty sure even if you buy a stock on Monday and sell on Tuesday and you do this with multiple stocks for most of the year they will consider it Day trading. If it takes your time they can easily consider it as work. If they are actually looking at you obviously.

An investi-gator.
1276 2018-11-11 23:32:13 Snitches get stitches. Yet I worry about Asian Masseuse stocks are plummeting about fear of running into Zach Smith.

1278 2018-11-11 23:29:38 I used some anime stocks from google and people got mad, its irrelevant now.

1283 2018-11-11 23:24:52 Nice, I like nflx amzn amd short, googl and jpm I expect will crumble next week. Hard to pick stocks long but if any I like wmt and colgate. Nvda puts as lottos
1284 2018-11-11 23:24:37 $GOOGL Adsense works really well, it know all my search history of interest. All of my YouTube ads is stocks market, and one ad in particular is Tim Sykes turned $5k into $5 Millions +. Ok.
1285 2018-11-11 23:23:52 Kinda, but key scoring drops by ARods WRs and late game Cam Brainfarts and 6-3 could just as easy be 4-5. I get it, we are 6-3, but it’s equates to .com stocks that are just days away from crashing if this QB can’t produce more pts. TB contributed to this win as much as the D.
1286 2018-11-11 23:22:07 The futures wheel has spun up.... leaning a touch weak. 
Lets take a look at a few individual stocks... on a grander perspective...
1287 2018-11-11 23:17:53 So it's now backed by itself?

Oh, you mean the new futures are going to settle in coin instead of cash.

Still don't see why that makes a difference, E Mini S&P futures settle in cash, not stocks, and they seem kind of popular.
1288 2018-11-11 23:17:36 Hillary Clinton placed into a blind trust a mural fund from Healthcare stocks totally $1 Million. Far cry from Billions. 
1st Bush used a blind trust in 84 when he was elected VP.
1289 2018-11-11 23:16:33 I think the fact is that most of these $BTC maximalists struck it lucky simply holding btc and have no real background in stocks and shares trading and so do not know how to value and evaluate tech startups like $CHX $QNT $FTT that are selling real software solutions for revenue
1290 2018-11-11 23:14:32 With #Brent probably being supported by OPEC news, I suspect that the many bullish RSI charts in UK Energy stocks, eg #PremierOil, #TullowOil #Ophir #Enquest #BP etc ( these last 2 not a precise defiinition) will lead to a good long trade this week for those who bought in on Fri
1291 2018-11-11 23:14:25 The establishment is between Scylla and Charybdis.

1296 2018-11-11 23:09:35 The World of Wallstreet... Vaguely remember stocks and changing prices as their values shifted.  As a kid we played it kind of often because it was different from the very few board games in the house.
1297 2018-11-11 23:03:03 You invest in stocks(people) when they’re low.

1307 2018-11-11 22:54:35 Except then it wouldn't touch any income that's from stocks, dividends and other investments, right?  That's the loophole the ultra rich use already. They don't pay payroll taxes.
1308 2018-11-11 22:52:13 Asia Pacific markets are looking at a negative start to the trading week. A resurgent US dollar, falling oil and base metal prices and pressure on European and US stocks on Friday night will likely cruel local sentiment @MicMcCarthy_CMC

1330 2018-11-11 22:13:51 As well as penny stocks,if you trade options or warrants and if you are withdrawing money on a regular basis.
1331 2018-11-11 22:10:09 I'm glad it wasn't too cloudy, or windy or whatever the f--- excuse you #snowflakes pulled yesterday to make yourselves even bigger laughing stocks than usual.
1332 2018-11-11 22:08:24 Yeah, they are expensive, but the engineering is phenomenal. If you can find a retailer that stocks them, go.and have a look.

Side fact: all the glass tables seen in the Star Wars prequel trilogy were off the shelf Naos tables.

1340 2018-11-11 21:50:20 @iJevin here is a synopsis of how you purchase the stocks

For all shares you buy from 8 dia. Ticker you pay 8 dia. Each.

For share with a value of 16 you pay in kind with that and so on for the rest

Example: 3 share for 8 dia. 24 diamo ds

8 share at 16dia = 128 diamonds

1345 2018-11-11 21:44:03 Yes yes yes. Though I say full ban on bump stocks AND ALL semi-automatics. There is no need for anyone to own a weapon for mass casualties. Keep your hand guns for protection, and rifles for hunting. Ban semi automatic weapons, designed for military, for mass destruction.
1346 2018-11-11 21:43:16 Definitely works better in some stocks than others. Helps if there's an "information gap" b/w insiders/activists and others. Usually this means mid-cap stocks work better, and stocks where there's a cohort of investors who are in-the-know.
1347 2018-11-11 21:39:58 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
1348 2018-11-11 21:39:50 It’s not “stocks”.  It’s “shares”.  Saying “stocks” is like saying “deers” or “fishes”.
1349 2018-11-11 21:38:40 Activision blizzard, their cash grab mobile game will make stocks stabilize.
1350 2018-11-11 21:37:54 That's it. I'm purchasing some stock in Lubriderm and Astroglide. Those stocks are going to explode come December 1st (no pun intended).
1351 2018-11-11 21:37:45 Yeah you don’t know anything about firearms because if you are cool with banning bump stocks and having a mag cap that shows a lot. But okay pretend you know about firearms
1352 2018-11-11 21:37:44 Nobody is trying to take guns away from those own them responsibly. However, there is no personal, civilian need for 30 round clips, bump stocks, ARs, etc. You can hunt, sport shoot and protect your family and property just fine without those.
1353 2018-11-11 21:36:24 In or in the way on pot stocks?
1354 2018-11-11 21:33:49 Don’t forget the people of Pakistan come from ethnic stocks such as DRAVIDIAN INDO-ARYAN  GREEK SCYTHIAN HUN ARAB MONGOL PERSIAN & AFGHAN that’s who we are our roots our ancestors

1356 2018-11-11 21:30:36 I have been doing research and listening to some other thoughts and views on the market this lazy Sunday.

1358 2018-11-11 21:30:20 Trillions printed were used to buy assets by Central banks.

1363 2018-11-11 21:24:49 Dick I know plenty about firearms. And wouldn’t talk about anything I haven’t used. Bump stocks entirely unnecessary. Is t it even scarier that you can fire exponentially more rounds inaccurately.
1364 2018-11-11 21:23:40 This happens often with the stocks I find attractive in my scan. Any quick method to know they are acquired? I have to run through all the recent news for the stock to get this, takes some time.
1365 2018-11-11 21:22:36 We lost more than we knew when we gave up the stocks in the public square.

1374 2018-11-11 21:14:55 Thanks for your questions!  1) I only hold my position trough earnings if I have a large profit cushion. Otherwise I cut down my position. 2) Traded pot stocks a lot of time. Currently they are not on my list. No good price action.
1375 2018-11-11 21:12:23 And thanks for stating the obvious... pretty sure we are all aware this is a speculative market... everyone doesn’t feel the need to tweet that about stocks but cool. Also, it is more of a gamble than say QTUM or XLM as both are partnered with corporations like IBM and AWS
1376 2018-11-11 21:08:15 Haha yes agree! I'll always look at multiple sources but I don't think the president gets a fair shake....everything you read is negative yet the economy, unemployment, stocks, etc are all doing fantastic

1379 2018-11-11 21:02:56 Yet ignores the fact that he had stocks in the company and went back on the " NOT A MEET AND GREET" rule. So they lied.
1380 2018-11-11 21:01:54 And not a cent in dividend or profits. We saw this happen with tech stocks a while ago. That went well.
1381 2018-11-11 21:01:25 Stocks still goin 
1382 2018-11-11 21:00:54 That was still very much open on the evidence of today's drive. Whipping Stocks always seemed a bit lacking in atmosphere, tbh

1384 2018-11-11 21:00:23 In investing there are 3 general asset classes: 1) Stocks or equities 2) Real Estate or 3) Businesses

1390 2018-11-11 20:56:10 Bear in mind—what the reporter gathers in the way of information, rumour or fact, is merely an aftermath of what has already been discounted in the market prices of stocks. He is not a seer but a reporter of events already taken place.
1391 2018-11-11 20:55:44 Oil stocks will crash in this weekend. Not exactly.　　石油株は今週末に暴落するだろう。いや、そうでもないよ。
1392 2018-11-11 20:52:29 So you own a home? Do you eat every day? Do you own a car?or have means to ride public transportation or Uber, do you have the clothes that you need (not want)? Stocks crash and burn everyday.
Save your money or invest it in real estate. Banks/businesses make millions off your $$
1393 2018-11-11 20:50:14 Win Jan canola up A$1.90/t & EU rape up A$6.42. More positive news towards resolving the US/China trade dispute. Support despite bearish USDA report for soybns that saw US stocks lifted. Canola up despite weaker palm oil & soyoil.
1394 2018-11-11 20:47:24 These cities need #GunReformNow . There’s a lot that can be done: Red Flag laws, tighten up background checks & improve data systems, ban bump stocks & assault weapons, and raise legal gun purchase age. #Enough #EndGunViolence #BanAssaultWeapons #RedFlagLaw
1395 2018-11-11 20:46:14 1. Fake CPI numbers. 2. Inflation in stocks. 3. Velocity 4. Gibson’s Paradox: gold defanged. 5. Op Twist sanitized long bond rate which is traditional inflation signal. 6. China price.ALL ENDING. Just a delay. #weimar imminent
1396 2018-11-11 20:45:51 And yet you're a Trump supporter lol, your country, your president is an absolute laughing stock globally, and I should know about laughing stocks, I live in the UK lol

1398 2018-11-11 20:44:12 So their stocks are worth more. Until they go down again. Because the executives sold their stock to take advantage of the higher prices.
1399 2018-11-11 20:43:56 Win Jan canola up A$1.90/t & EU rape up A$6.42. More positive news towards resolving the US/China trade dispute. Support despite bearish USDA report for soybns that saw US stocks lifted. Canola up despite weaker palm oil & soyoil.
1400 2018-11-11 20:42:43 Tomorrow will hopefully be a good day for oil stocks! Talks of imminent OPEC+ cuts should increase oil prices!
1401 2018-11-11 20:41:08 Because it went up hundreds of percent last year! Stocks don't move in a straight line. I'm guessing you bought north of $20 because you sure are mad.
1402 2018-11-11 20:40:58 Well if you're wanting UBCs they won't work without a national registry, which is illegal per FOPA

Bumpfire stocks (Correct term) and all gun accessories are protected per #2a and SCOTUS' rulings in DC v Heller and Caetano v Massachusetts

Next #gunsense/#guncontrol proposals?
1403 2018-11-11 20:37:49 I see. But who in their right minds would buy stocks and watch it plummet. Like srsly? It's better to just do other stuff to promote exo rather than this bullshit

1405 2018-11-11 20:35:19 And do you really think they envisioned the future of guns being automatic & semi-automatic guns, bump stocks and guns on planes?

1408 2018-11-11 20:29:43 so 2A allowing AR15s and bump stocks is just fine ... you have no clue how fucking stupid that is ... if you all must have a gun to feel tough or some how safe, go  back to single shot muskets and do yourselves a huge favour

1418 2018-11-11 20:14:11 I know why AT&T stocks keeps going down. Getting NFL Sunday ticket on Directv to stream live on my laptop was impossible took 2 hours on the phone with tech support and they still couldn’t do it. So I cancelled, but I really don’t think they care. Poor guy is just doing his job.
1419 2018-11-11 20:14:10 Make the comeback like two stocks with SoPo
1420 2018-11-11 20:14:10 @RiverAnnan  follow me back please so I can private message you. I saw 2 feeders today on edge of river with cattle knee deep in glar. Any wonder fish stocks struggle on the tributary rivers-this particular river once held many brownies and saw runs of sea trout. 
1421 2018-11-11 20:13:17 Stocks are higher than us
1422 2018-11-11 20:12:48 I feel sorry for anyone who accepts the neocon donkey fazoo at NR and TWS. But I understand their anger. They are worried that under Trump they will not make money on their war stocks and may have to make their own beds and mow their own lawns if all the illegals are deported.
1423 2018-11-11 20:12:32 That I should invest my beer and fancy shoe money in stocks and vintage Barbie dolls...
1424 2018-11-11 20:10:24 Agree, let them have the bump stocks.

1428 2018-11-11 20:02:40 Then sentiment should tell you we're going north next. Oil will #crash with stocks. We could still hit 3000+ in the S&P before stocks crash.
1429 2018-11-11 20:02:38 Sir in live section when you discuss on stocks and trands. Can you share your screen, so I can understand and learn property.
1430 2018-11-11 20:02:01 I don’t to much care for bump stocks, they are a irrelevant piece of equipment that effects accurate handling of a semi automatic firearm. Also bump fire can be achieved without it.

1436 2018-11-11 19:56:34 LOL!

That’s EXACTLY the point of Y ALL PRIOR POTUSes liquidated their biz assets & placed funds in a “BLIND trust” (a financial manager didn’t tell them what stocks they owned in their portfolio, so it wouldn’t offer the appearance of impropriety by favoring certain bizs).

1448 2018-11-11 19:46:51 The bottom line is that we are in a bear market and 100$ oil is a joke. Oil stocks especially Canadian ones will remain in the foreseeable future in a bear market.

1452 2018-11-11 19:41:47 Fair point. All right, I concede on this point. However, Donald Trump, the Republican Floridian government, and myself all agree that bump stocks should be illegal.

1461 2018-11-11 19:33:22 It’s too convenient timing as their stocks have recently plummeted and I personally would rather spend my time & money on games where developers aren’t shafting consumers. MicroT’s are poisoning the industry & my stance is to just stay away from their titles for the most part.

Hell, almost every time #trump opens his mouth the value of my own stocks drop in price. 

All we see is prices going up and our wages staying the same even in a booming economy.

1481 2018-11-11 19:10:43 Dollar may not be in trouble until coming Bear Market has largely run its course.  Treasury purchases of Bonds by former holders of stocks may replace purchases by China, Japan for a while..
1482 2018-11-11 19:10:03 Not that bad.

After last week's recovery upon elections results, maybe 20-25% of SP-500 stocks are in bear markets (-20% down from the highs).  Need to double check on this stats.

1536 2018-11-11 17:59:03 This is a genuine question... Is a car running on fossil fuels using more energy than an electric car relying on fossil fuel produced energy?  I've never seen a comparison.  I wish we could totally ditch fossil fuels.  I have stocks in renewable energy companies to support that!

1542 2018-11-11 17:53:49 Bollocks (one more time).

Had there been laws preventing the sale of the rifles used by the gunman (along with a ban on bump stocks), then he woykdnot have had access to those weapons.

Gun laws work in reducing mass shootings. This is undeniable.

1606 2018-11-11 17:05:21 So you should look up New Jersey. They got bump stocks banned but not a single person has turned them in like there supposed to. If you ban them how are you supposed to get them when you do. Oh you can 3D print them by the way if you know how to make one or have a file already
1607 2018-11-11 17:04:50 Uhm, some are aiming/saying to crash or ruin SM’s stocks?

1611 2018-11-11 17:02:35 Trump refuses to take his annual salary of nearly half-a-million bucks and instead orders that it be distributed to charities. If he's interested in "profiting" off the office, that's a dumb way to do it. I for one would buy property and stocks with that kind of dough.
1612 2018-11-11 17:02:06 Gun people and the NRA , want nothing done . Remember let’s ban bump stocks , oh sorry we can’t do that . No one needs any AR type guns . If you want to collect those gun , great do that , but firing pins need to be removed. Again something is better then nothing

1624 2018-11-11 16:57:58 Don’t wait until a stock/investment is HOT and popular in the news, to buy! The price has gone up by that point. The goal is to BUY LOW and SELL HIGH.

1682 2018-11-11 16:04:40 It can be scary & isn’t for everyone. However, after some experience (mostly failures) and guidance, I’ve learned that it is a fantastic way to build generational wealth.

1684 2018-11-11 16:04:02 I would watch out traders to trust people opening rooms with 1-2 yrs trading experience, trying to teach you, getting your money as subs to build their account. Open your eyes. The wine to be good has to stays in barrells years and years. So avoid fake mentors

1770 2018-11-11 14:28:24 For kind attention of gold bulls , was just seeing today the Long Term Hurst Cycles , I am fairly sure the 7.0 - 7.5 year long term cycle ( from 2011 high) makes it imperative that we see a big high in gold next year . Mining stocks would have flown much earlier as always .

1773 2018-11-11 14:25:37 True that it's time-consuming to look at hundreds of charts. 

Scanning through charts outside the screeners at times reveal great opportunities. We still need some basic filters to avoid looking at 2000 NSE stocks.

With time you instantly know if there is a trade on the chart.
1774 2018-11-11 14:23:17 Markets always have reasons to correct. When Nifty PE is 28x it means one needs to wait for 28 yrs to grt back ones money in the stock market. Historical avg is 16-18x. If one not ready to live thro correction then one should not invest in Stocks.
1775 2018-11-11 14:22:46 Wrong. Jobs are actually being lost.   The tax breaks?  Benefit only the richest.   His promise to the middle class is BS.   The economy is doing ok, but again it benefits only the rich, who buy back their own stocks, not create new jobs.

2010 2018-11-11 08:28:53 Obsession or dedication? I sometimes have to ask myself that question! 8:00am Sunday morning am on trading station scanning for potential plays next week, trying to find 10 stocks primed for a move. Then more studying.

2012 2018-11-11 08:27:01 US stocks have averaged about 10% per year (with dividend) over the past 30 years, which includes 1990, 2001, and 2008 recessions. If you're not making money, then you need to hire someone who's better at it than you are.

I know that you have access to better resources & can you do much better than avg ppl like me. What I meant to say was that just because a P/BV or P/E is low, doesn't mean it qualifies for invstmt.

2049 2018-11-11 06:55:40 I'm talking about ordinary semi-automatic guns like the AR15.

2068 2018-11-11 06:17:34 Anything that is against a crazy right winged pro war political party to you must be pro communist party, huh?  No, I’m not for voting for a communist party. Communist and socialist parties  believe that the Gov should take over banks and should regulate stocks. That’s scary.
2069 2018-11-11 06:16:18 It's a cliche, but I hope you'll invest in penny stocks to cure your EDS
2070 2018-11-11 06:14:12 Avg nifty pe ratio is around 14-18. Currently we are expensive compared to long term avgs. PE ratio is mean reverting, hence you can expect it to go back to test 18 (around 7.5-8k) levels if globally stocks correct.
2071 2018-11-11 06:12:37 Gaan ko daddy kwarta. Hmmmmm png stocks or blackpink concert?
2072 2018-11-11 06:07:42 These explanations are beautiful.. These kind of practical knowledge is needed for choosing stocks.
2073 2018-11-11 06:05:16 They should've known this before and the stocks should have been limited
2074 2018-11-11 06:04:40 As someone who keep an eye on marketing activity even their stocks price,  I don't think they were going to bankruptcy that time. 2PM were already climbing their peak in Japan in 2014. Seeing how they filled the malls every Got7 comeback I can say they did a good job.
2075 2018-11-11 06:03:12 Nice thread ..Most of market participants thinks that inclusion in FNO makes stocks blueschip or heavyweight or A group stock but many previous examples like ABGSHIP ,ABAN, ADLAB,KSOIL,GTL and few other name even these RCom, Unitech are eye openers n now turned into penny
2076 2018-11-11 05:57:35 Great. 50% of voters don’t own stocks. So what may be good for you doesn’t mean it’s good for all. A good jobs report means nothing if people still work 2jobs to make ends meet. Inflation is up so slow wage growth doesn’t help. The poor/middle-class are still struggling.
2077 2018-11-11 05:56:14 For someone whose allergens are easily triggered by almost everything like Faith Joy’s, having lotsa stocks of antihistamine is a must. Or else.. 
2078 2018-11-11 05:52:55 many people believe that if the market is going up all the stocks will go up if the market is falling down everything is falling down this is very crude way of thinking
2079 2018-11-11 05:51:17 What is disturbing is you are thinking about #bitcoin as if it were a stock. Bitcoin will replace 90 trillion in currency $200+ trillion in debt, 1/3 of real estate, 1/3 of stocks. Your estimates are absurdly low.20 years is an eternity in technology, more so bitcoin.
2080 2018-11-11 05:51:06 Sakto naman pagdating ng stocks lol
2081 2018-11-11 05:50:16 What do you think of bump stocks? I don’t see any reasonable use for them. Congress discussed them in Feb(?) but no legislation.

2090 2018-11-11 05:37:06 Public shaming and pillories and stocks would be a 'death sentence' to people like trump...wheeled out once a day to the town square......Sheesh and I was once  against such things...time for therapy. 
2091 2018-11-11 05:34:26 I plan buy new phone actually but cannt make it...hermo for some skincare...i actually dun need them now...i still lots of stocks...shopee...some herbs, medicine, food, make up etc...and i bought books frm taobao...i think im crazy
2092 2018-11-11 05:32:41 @modern_rock do you have a good broker with shorting opportunities for most small cap stocks. I don’t have over $25000.
2093 2018-11-11 05:29:01 A friend on twitter told me he was discussing a bundle of stocks used for starting doors and used the same, literally correct, word and es also banned for 12 so I thought I'd test it out and discuss Mr Brains delicacy.
2094 2018-11-11 05:26:55 Such poetic justice! Glad he's being relegated to the dustbin of history.  I vote we bring back public pillories & stocks for treasonous politicians...as they wait for their death sentences to be carried out. 
2095 2018-11-11 05:21:49 Really? It would be great if you could do a video on it. I've been stuck on how to buy stocks since I came back
2096 2018-11-11 05:21:48 [INTEREST CHECK] I’ll be selling bunny hats pero limited stocks lang. 2 weeks from now yung arrival ng items. Please DM me if you’re interested to buy.
2097 2018-11-11 05:21:37 But aren't the numbers kind of an arbitrary convention?  If the Burkina Faso exchange has exploration stocks with only 100 shares o/s, would it make the TSX look bad?
2098 2018-11-11 05:20:54 Even 1000 stocks in the same asset class will take a punishment if one is not diversified. I also took a major hit but there is time yet. Maybe not as much at home though.. our gov seems to find convenient ways of being two faced on promises.
2099 2018-11-11 05:17:53 Oh yea I had I similar issue I mean I get doing stocks and removing items but if your telling me we can't have a fair fight on stages like wrestling ring because the thing above can fall then that's when it's just dumb to ban stages
2100 2018-11-11 05:15:33 Naked short should be forbidden , I have the same issue in my portfolio with some stocks also . We investors are investing with money , they steal money from us with borrowed stocks !

2104 2018-11-11 05:08:59 Opo super limited talaga yung stocks! I think less than a hundred lang yun 
2105 2018-11-11 05:07:56 But the Converse is also true, buying stocks in a bad market is like buying a good house in a bad localty hoping that the localty would eventually improve!!!!!

2107 2018-11-11 05:05:15 So multibaggers are only dependent on US market.Naked truth? So stocks listed on BSE & NSE should do business only in US.Not in a country with 1.3 Billion people.
2108 2018-11-11 05:03:44 Some proven practices:

1. A database to cross reference gun owners with people who have mental health issues
2. Intervene EARLY with mental health issues 
3. Ban high capacity kill machines (e.g. assault rifles,  bump stocks, extended mags)

Note: none of these violate the 2A

2114 2018-11-11 04:55:10 All guns DON'T have to be rounded up. Proper background checks, banning guns from domestic abusers, banning bump stocks & weapons too powerful even for hunting(!) are some things. Good people can hunt as per normal with non-military style weapons.

2128 2018-11-11 04:27:00 They wouldn’t be borrowing money in 2016 for “war on shale”. Them borrowing money was a desperate act. They were selling stocks to survive. If they were on war on shale and had spare capacity they would  e using spare capacity.
2129 2018-11-11 04:22:53 Mento. What do you think about silver? Many of the Fang stocks, especially Apple look like they are mimicking bitcoin before the crash. Silver TA looks quite nice for entry.

2132 2018-11-11 04:20:23 The federal ban on assault weapons expired in 2004. A few states outlaw them but most don’t. 10 states have banned bump stocks in the aftermath of the Las Vegas shooting. Otherwise they are easy to obtain.

2139 2018-11-11 04:06:36 Macro thoughts. When an economy is on the up I look for stocks that will benefit. The opposite is true when things look like they have peaked or are about to. Right now it looks to me like ours has peaked. A rate cut might kick the can but the outcome will be the same.

2147 2018-11-11 03:52:22 Trump also promised to ban bump stocks and discuss gun sense laws. Neither of which happened. I'm not against 2nd amendment but am opposed to how easy it is to buy a AR-15, or rapid fire guns. I've heard many gun owners who are for stricter laws.

2182 2018-11-11 02:58:20 I agree with banning bump stocks and the research. What would you like added to the current background checks or what should make someone ineligible to own a gun? And absolutely no to the safe storage laws and licenses

2185 2018-11-11 02:56:45 So a background check before being able to purchase a gun, is that what you are saying?
I want to clarify before I respond.

Banning bump stocks, I totally agree. They serve no legitimate purpose.
Nobody can buy assault weapons now, they are already illegal.

2187 2018-11-11 02:51:43 Fools... I'll ban your guns and then have you all arrested for having pistol grips, flash suppressors, and collapsible stocks.

Might take some time, but with red flag laws, all it'll take is an tip from concerned "family members" for a SWAT team to show up at your door...
2188 2018-11-11 02:51:21 Thinking of things like universal background checks, safe storage laws, mental health & prior violent/domestic violence restrictions. Licensed ownership w/renewal. Banning bump stocks. Investing in research into gun violence & prevention.

2190 2018-11-11 02:45:48 Our apology for the delay. As at 10am today, no stocks for all of our outlets. From time to time, you may check with us again ya. Thank you.
2191 2018-11-11 02:45:19 @NRA tell us again how guns arb’t the problem?  Bump stocks & extended magazines, are not used for hunting FYI....
2192 2018-11-11 02:45:03 How management communicates mistakes is very important. No one is mistake-free - as investors 40% of the stocks we buy underperform the market - and I'd be concerned about any company where shareholder communication doesn't include a candid assessment of mistakes. - Bill Nygren
2193 2018-11-11 02:44:39 Also interesting to see how assets are treated as collateral. For F-1 visa, I've seen stocks considered same as cash, discounted 50%, or excluded from assets entirely (differs by university).

2196 2018-11-11 02:40:25 What are even babbling about?  Of course, stocks are over-priced, and going to deflate. That's a direct consequence of rising interest rates, far more than some tax proposal.

Tax rates don't matter that much to businesses, higher rates incent allocations besides net income.
2197 2018-11-11 02:39:27 Banning extended magazines doesn't infringe on your rights.

Banning grenades doesn't infringe on your rights.

Banning bump stocks doesn't infringe on your rights.

Vegas didn't change a thing, I have seen your tweets, you scoffed at gun control pre-Vegas too.   Stop lying.
2198 2018-11-11 02:35:52 Since it being an index. dont think will invest. some specific Stocks yes.
2199 2018-11-11 02:32:28 You can dodge the grab on reaction. It tends to hit because ppl forget about it - they aren't threatened.

2206 2018-11-11 02:24:20 The lack of a buffer tube isn't necessarily disqualifying, the HK416 and other piston actuated ARs don't have buffer tubes, just a projection for mounting AR stocks.
The warning label on the mag well is a giveaway though.
2207 2018-11-11 02:24:11 Just to play Devils advocate here....if I'm a law abiding citizen and want to buy a gun, why should I be taxes for a crime I didn't commit?  Let's start with background checks, wait period, magazine size, bump stocks

2215 2018-11-11 02:18:26 One of the differences between the February correction and this recent sell-off is that back in Feb the S&P only fell below its 200DMA one time intraday and never closed below it. This time it's been battling with its 200DMA for a month and has closed below it many times. #Stocks
2216 2018-11-11 02:17:55 Call your pension plans and 401ks. Tell them, dump the gun stocks or I dump you. That will cut nra funding fast. They will go back to being a gun safety club.
2217 2018-11-11 02:16:26 If you slow down panda mating sounds --barks, roars, chirps or the "you're about to get lucky" bleat-- they sound remarkably like whale calls. Not that I'd suggest any Mad Science if your heart melts at the idea of baby whales or replenishing endangered stocks.
2218 2018-11-11 02:16:20 NRA is past tense. 2nd amendment requires revision...background checks WHENEVER and WHEREEVER a gun is sold, ANY mental health history is a disqualifier, bump stocks are illegal and AR-15’s or any high velocity semi-automatic weapon.
2219 2018-11-11 02:15:30 Health care for all, living wages, climate change consciousness legislation, universal bg checks for all gun purchases, ban all assault rifles and bump stocks, etc

2225 2018-11-11 02:03:38 It sounds pretty unbelievable making $100,000 dollars a year trading. 
Lets say 10 trades a day, 7 winners, 3 losers. 
RR=3:1, avg winner = $44 profit, avg loser = $11
Alternatively $273 a day = $100,000 a year. Consistency is the key, discipline is the tool.

I like when most people are bearish on the expensive stocks i hold in my core portfolio.

For the same reason IMO, all stocks should be in f&o so that skeptics can short them!

2228 2018-11-11 01:56:40 What does NRA support actually mean? No research on preventing gun violence, no restrictions on bum stocks, high cap magazines, no movement toward gun safety at all. Sorry doc, "being a physician" does nothing to stop the slaughter. Enough.

2236 2018-11-11 01:49:00 Surprised to see u stocks tank with the general market in Oct, for me this indicates they likely will do it again during another downturn.I’m taking profits on the exuberant days & keeping more cash on hand than usual while keeping a strong hand in the game for the unexpected. 
2237 2018-11-11 01:48:34 Opioids and guns. You can start with that.  Remember when trump said we don’t need bump stocks???
2238 2018-11-11 01:47:56 Trump's shoe was also untied - sending a message to anyone that cared to listen that he didn't care about shoelaces.  Stocks on shoelaces immediately plummeted.

2253 2018-11-11 01:28:54 I get that. Bump stocks are already banned.  All guns are " military type" guns when ya get right down to it. Don't get me wrong, I'd like to fix this too.

2261 2018-11-11 01:17:17 @WarrenBuffett Could it be possible to have US Military Funding turned from capital into Dividend Yielding Stocks, section it into "housing", "machinery", "danger pay", etc... then offer investors and everyone ability to receive passive income and help our troops get better pay?
2262 2018-11-11 01:17:13 5 on 3 and 2 of the 3 without stocks,  PUT THE FUCKING PUCK ON NET QUIT PICKING CORNERS AND SHOOTING WIDE FOR FUCKS SAKE
2263 2018-11-11 01:14:42 According to source.  Fuel stocks very tight ,suppliers are being rationed already. Trucks being stood down as can’t get fuel to deliver .Shipments coming in are not up to standard. Many distributors can not get their daily allocation .All providers are on rations

2266 2018-11-11 01:12:50 Very possible; but will take a much lower USD as Fed reverses.  If there is a crisis anywhere in the world, UST supplies will rise markedly, & the more US stocks fall the more UST supplies will rise from US gov't.
2267 2018-11-11 01:11:39 When will my stocks on neopets.
2268 2018-11-11 01:10:47 Democracy is obscene huh, your state and Florida are laughing stocks when it comes to running elections
2269 2018-11-11 01:07:56 Even if they got a fine I'd drop it. Also why do they get no punishment but elon musk smokes a joint on a podcast which harms absolutely no-one and teslas stocks drop? All because you have money doesn't mean you can get away with things.
2270 2018-11-11 01:06:28 Did ya see Oil Search... down 20% since Oct high. Imagine starting the year overweight banks and energy stocks?
2271 2018-11-11 01:05:31 Earnings for #ACB, #CGC, and #TLRY coming up, but watch for #LBUY and #APHQF. I try to cover long term and short term stocks, as well as deals for products for tons of stores. Check out Marijuana Stock Market group on FB.

2273 2018-11-11 01:02:14 @findingmoats bums out Piedmont investor who asks "what three stocks are about to blow up"

"well I am the least risky investor you will meet, I don't know cryptocurrency, don't know Tesla, I invest in what is in your cabinet like band aids"
2274 2018-11-11 01:00:36 This is noble if you include a passage that says Senators and House of Representatives cannot purchase stocks while in office.  True public service precludes Congress people from investing in the companies they sanction to receive their multi-billion dollar contracts.
2275 2018-11-11 01:00:30 I just can’t make anything else, like headers for example, I’ll make them soooo clean but not look good because it isn’t filled with stocks
2276 2018-11-11 01:00:08 No we'd be in a wedding at SOP and apparently it's a Leica M9. Problem is, all the money, government bonds and stocks it took 7 but that's what, every few days, hello failing preliminaries.
2277 2018-11-11 00:58:38 Ok, Trump people!!

2279 2018-11-11 00:56:39 R3 is private blockchain and useful because its legally binding.  Corda is ideal for stocks and bonds or commodities.

2282 2018-11-11 00:52:24 Great idea that mate 
I donated some food today @CityofLpoolFC @SFoodbanks and I know that food banks are running low on food stocks, so they would be made up for more support, although everyone would understand if the family had their own charity to support. 
2283 2018-11-11 00:50:36 And watch your liquor company stocks go up.
2284 2018-11-11 00:46:44 Only investors will get crushed. Traders make money in a Bull or Bear market and we only hold trades for short periods.  If we see stocks looking weak on a daily chart we just short the stock and make money as it crashes.
2285 2018-11-11 00:46:17 limited stocks lang yung konbat for sureee

2290 2018-11-11 00:39:41 People who go to bars and drive home buzzed are illegals. People who hire undocumented workers are illegals, people with bump stocks will soon be illegals. Why do you focus, like Hitler, only one group?
2291 2018-11-11 00:38:07 Congratulations,  James!  God bless you,  your friends, and your family.  I will never stop supporting you,  no matter what happens. Please reply if you see this,  it would mean a lot to me!

2294 2018-11-11 00:35:28 Sometimes stocks fail at Box pivots because maybe fundamentals aren't ready yet. Did $DATA $ETSY ramp because of shorts getting annihilated or because Longs see long-term value? I don't know $STUDY
2295 2018-11-11 00:34:17 45% of the S&P 500 stocks are in a bear market. Amazingly the index is only 5% off its 52 week high.
2296 2018-11-11 00:34:01 $amrn lots of good bull/bear debates on 2days data. Stocks been priced 4 perfection.just don’t c it up Monday. Q is how much does it drop on Monday, does it overshoot 2 downside & recover some??
2297 2018-11-11 00:33:15 "When stocks reach highs of the past two to three years, a common refrain or explanation is that expanded valuations are rational. Why? Because we have low rates." Trey Reik @SprottMedia on some classic circular logic!

2299 2018-11-11 00:31:24 There are plenty of steadier stocks at around 10 times.Those stocks are around 5 times but super cyclical. Whats certain is I have no interest in KO MCd and PG at twenty something times.
2300 2018-11-11 00:31:08 He’s on loan. If Dortmund starts him in every game and he scores a lot of goals, his stocks will rise, then Barça will demand more money if they choose to buy him

2306 2018-11-11 00:24:36 know any good mushroom stocks?
2307 2018-11-11 00:24:32 I'd rather buy stocks down 30% trading at 10 times earnings than no growth staples at 20+ times earnings

2310 2018-11-11 00:21:26 Imported food SUPPORTS local jobs in some cases (eg, tourism, where it is input to local goods (eg Starbucks’ imports from its worldwide stocks)).
2311 2018-11-11 00:21:17 Well, then we will not infringe on your rights, and just ban AR 15 and bump stocks. As they kill the most people at one time. 
And let’s not forget “the few hundred” that were Children.

2315 2018-11-11 00:17:26 Next big things to watch out for Indian stocks . Crude fall n Rupee strengthening r positive but 5 states poll results r key. Opposition Unity matters for stock markets if BJP fails to deliver in #5StatePolls.
2316 2018-11-11 00:17:17 This is a more specific article relating to stocks, but there are also quantifiable increases in gun purchases following fear rhetoric.
2317 2018-11-11 00:16:01 Comicsgate is a marketplace of ideas and the community will accept or reject creators and their works at their collective discretion. The stocks of some will rise and others will crash, but never based on the opinion of a single member. There is room for all to try.
2318 2018-11-11 00:15:03 That's a really good damn idea but your missing one big thing. Glider redeploy is ass. Just remove it but there going to keep it in, so it should be a limit of uses. you start with 2 redeploys. You use one then get a kill and it re stocks the use. Finishing fights is rewarded.
2319 2018-11-11 00:13:50 I'm so proud of you! Huge congrats to you and everyone else! 
2320 2018-11-11 00:13:43 Amazing

2322 2018-11-11 00:12:14 My aunt works in international banking so I have little to no interest in that industry

Marketing is only for tech cause I cannot do the whole make up and fashion industry
2323 2018-11-11 00:11:26 There are more natural source in the European land to Asian lead, importing stocks foreign stock market... Education Laws and politics can get bills and right to trades @FoxNews
2324 2018-11-11 00:06:57 I think the biggest blessing and curse for my investing experience is that as soon as i enter a market I experience exuberant returns... 
started investing in mostly tech stocks before the tech rally in 2016 (I had $NVDA @ 27 dollars lol)
Crypto @ May of 2017
2325 2018-11-11 00:05:22 Another albeit much smaller disconnect between a improving/rising commodity price and flat to low stock prices on the ASX

The falsehood of the tech industry saving us all is coming to an end (look at tech stocks this yr) the money will run dry. Ill wait out the disasters even if worse then 09 & be here to take advantage of the rebuild
2335 2018-11-09 23:49:49 The blaming Melo story is corny & overly used. Instead of giving him the shine when not deserved, give it to another person that can use it to better their "stocks"...
2336 2018-11-09 23:47:54 Like Nanci Pelocy's insider stocks profits or the Bush family arms profit  during the Iraq war? It's all so dodgy. From an outsider looking in it seems people just want their side to win rather than the country & will sabotage any perceived progress if their side can't get credit
2337 2018-11-09 23:46:31 I prefer when Alpha talks more X Rated (18+) to stocks. Like " Come on Baby!" Or " Give daddy what he wants".
2338 2018-11-09 23:45:45 I would laugh about stocks rallying as those lines relentlessly declined for years.... 

Do we actually sell off now as expectations improve my the first time in a decade!
2339 2018-11-09 23:45:18 Today saw falls in political stocks, as volatility in integrity markets led to shame across the Labour market. The LNP wasn’t spared, as insider shaming led many to question the value of the Hang Out to Dry index. Expect Elliot shares to dive in coming days.

And that’s My stance
2340 2018-11-09 23:44:51 Here’s an idea; Nobody under 18 gets a gun, 3 day waiting period, ban bump-stocks, ban high capacity magazines, expanded background checks, limit ammo. Am I asking for too much?  I just want to save lives.
2341 2018-11-09 23:43:40 apple stocks rise by 69%.

2365 2018-11-09 23:38:49 As to your question:  Those stocks were nearly always purchased using money which had been earned through labor and had already been taxed at least once.  The companies are also taxed for their profits, and then individual earnings from stock investments are taxed yet again.
2366 2018-11-09 23:36:47 Weed stocks are also good to get into  it just wait a few days. They just spiked cause of legalazion in some states and now they’re going down since everyone is selling so try to pick up as low as possible and hold
2367 2018-11-09 23:36:24 If @theresa_may wants to keep the whole of UK in the Customs Union to appease @DUPleader then, it will have to grant access to fishing stocks or stop fishing exports to the EU altogether. Call it #BrexitDiminishment
2368 2018-11-09 23:35:54 54 million Americans have 401k retirement accounts, which are essentially shares in a 'pool' comprised of stocks, bonds, and money market investments.

The entire US workforce is roughly 150 million, so meaning that ±60 million is a sizable chunk of working Americans with stocks.
2369 2018-11-09 23:33:14 It’s also better than sitting in stocks and having them potentially plummet.
2370 2018-11-09 23:32:18 Which spike tobacco stocks as all it does is protect tobacco sales and will prolong the epidemic of death, disease and disability caused by smoking.

It's so sad the "responsible drug policy" is backsliding like it is.

We can all do better.

2373 2018-11-09 23:23:32 Oil is down for the last ten days...longest streak in 34 years. If you have energy stocks, I would evaluate if they still meet your objectives. If you don’t own them, time to look for a long term buying opportunity. #money #investments

2375 2018-11-09 23:23:09 Anyone know the status of effort to repeal Republican bill that actually bans studies into gun violence?  Or the ban of bump stocks?
2376 2018-11-09 23:22:00 They'll both go down the same. Cash on hand will buy house/stocks. A 50% cash position with a 35% hedge on stocks (now) looks to be decent plan. 

I'm betting when it happens, it happens quickly. Six months should be ample time to find bottom. How long it lingers there is the ?
2377 2018-11-09 23:21:41 That's what I'd do if I knew anything about stocks.

Not a fan of legalization ( we do need hemp oil for medical reasons, the other stuff will create big problems), but Uncle Sam needs the Tax $$
But I will admit I own stocks in the pot field

2383 2018-11-09 23:16:16 LMAO!

Whataboutism again!  Stop playing victim because nobody is vilifying gun owners...the NRA fills your head with that dribble.  My family hunts.  My cousin used to raise beagles to hunt rabbits.

Banning bump stocks or AR-15's or expanded clips/magazines vilifies nobody.
2384 2018-11-09 23:15:58 bitch u got my stocks again?!!!
2385 2018-11-09 23:13:58 Haniver, the made the adjustments because NBS made changes to China’s corn area and production numbers going back 10 years. Thus USDA followed with similar adjustments that forced stocks to increase. As you know, NBS doesn’t report stock numbers.
2386 2018-11-09 23:13:53 More than 50% in the voting. But buying 50% is literally not possible because it would mean that current stockholders would lose their power and there are many ways how they can prevent it from happening. Not to mention that stocks aren't just there you have to buy it from~
2387 2018-11-09 23:13:18 I am not sure if buying stocks would work. Even if we had enough money, we would have to have more than 50% of the stocks to actually have a word in the decision-making. If we had less we could still influence the process but none of our request would be realised until we had~
2388 2018-11-09 23:10:33 I recycled cans & newspapers for extra cash. My older Co-workers taught be about investing & stocks. When I left the food industry I started working overseeing clinical trials. Been doing this 18y and for 14 of those years I’ve worked NO LESS than 2 projects at a time.
2389 2018-11-09 23:09:44 Dec FOMC? Jan crash in stocks. Best guess is somewhere between Dec and end Q1 latest.
2390 2018-11-09 23:09:15 Importantly, the way we finance investment is almost exclusively through the creation of NON-GOVT financial assets (stocks, bonds, etc). These are THE MOST important financial assets in our economy as they finance the investment that makes the entire system viable.
2391 2018-11-09 23:07:37 I believe in some gun control. Basic background checks, no FULLY auto weapons, no bump stocks. An AR is no different than a pistol, except the bullet flies faster. It is a smaller bullet that flies faster. It is NOT a weapon of war. Those are Auto, not one trigger pull = 1 bullet
2392 2018-11-09 23:07:15 How to stocks?
2393 2018-11-09 23:07:13 Yes we barely get a mention in this whole thing from anyone We aren't all sitting on a paid for house with private healthcare & stocks & shares  Some of us also hold long-held plans put in jeopardy Many of us work, care for elders & children in Uni, not a sniff of consideration
2394 2018-11-09 23:06:00 Larry do you trade stocks or options?
2395 2018-11-09 23:03:17 $MNST and $CL both closed up over 4% and are Friday's top performing $SPX #stocks; $NRG and $EQT both gained over 3% while $APA $CMG $DO $MTD $PXD $KMB and $XEL all closed up over 2% on the day #trading

2402 2018-11-09 22:56:57 If this bull market is over, it may be time for new leaders to emerge... This may be the end for the FAANGs as your typical growth stock leaders, as they may now move into just large cap value stocks like INTC, DIS, MSFT...
2403 2018-11-09 22:55:38 Simple tea today.  Used up my biscuits yesterday.  We need to get back on the road here soon so i can replenish my stocks.  Should also save some gold for a wagon, so i can haul a kitchen and food with us.
2404 2018-11-09 22:55:09 So to sum up the past 36 hours:

Mexican stocks lost $20 billion on Thursday (and stayed down on Friday) because AMLO's close ally/Senate head of the party he founded released a banking bill that the President-elect doesn't want to see become national policy.

Mexico in 2018.
2405 2018-11-09 22:54:22 The NRA took actions to help pass laws against the use of bump-stocks in the weeks following the Las Vegas shooting. They were the biggest critic of Bump-Stocks following the tragedy. The NRA and the members they represent do not condone the use of those attachments.
2406 2018-11-09 22:53:14 Like it drove every sector up since 2016. Momentum stocks cut both ways.
2407 2018-11-09 22:51:48 Tucker Carlson has insanely valuable food stocks that necessitate a lock on the pantry door.

Not us. We have no debt.

It's most of the stocks we've been trading for the last few years. So many of them are screwed at a fundamental level.

2479 2018-11-09 22:03:31 No, those stocks came from Russian front line stocks although they got just 4 launchers. That's not enough to make a difference nor does the system have 360 degree coverage, nor does the S-400 for that matter or Patriot, nor until ARES comes online.

2493 2018-11-09 21:56:47 We don't argue strict back ground checks. But it's the same as taxes once you give them a little bit, they never stop and keep coming from more. First it's bump stocks, then it's a ARS, then it's Glocks and handguns, then we're all dead.
2494 2018-11-09 21:56:34 People ask me why I get enjoyment out of the stocks crashing, actually not really enjoyment.

2501 2018-11-09 21:51:53 The stock/flow modelling is a bit weird. We tend to treat (for example) consumption as a pure continuous flow. But KW electricity is about the only example that comes to mind. And even then, I pay for it in bi-monthly stocks of KWhours.
And money circulates (lumpy flows).

2518 2018-11-09 21:42:24 It might be just a spinfoil theory here, but the attack on Destiny comes suspiciously close on the heels of the Diablo Immortal debacle which made Activision stocks tank which makes me think this is more than coincidental timing. I'm wondering if this is

2549 2018-11-09 21:22:25 I will never ever agree with the thinking that we should do nothing instead of something.

No one expects regulating civilian high capacity mags, bump stocks, or ARs to stop 100% of mass shootings.

Any less people shot is the goal.

We voted on how we wanted to do that here.

2557 2018-11-09 21:14:43 I agree completely. Hope it comes soon. I dislike most of what Trump does but to his credit, he and Sessions have made headway on bump stocks. It's up to the OBM now.
2558 2018-11-09 21:13:59 World stocks retreat: US -.9%; Europe -.4%. With no catalyst to rise, stocks focused on slower global growth & China trade issues.

2587 2018-11-09 21:00:07 Yeah I agree  but it gets sticky when we consider intent behind the amendment. Would it be possible to resist tyranny if an armed revolution happened now? Also I think banning bump stocks is reasonable but banning semi automatics is too far.

2605 2018-11-09 20:47:00 There. I couldnt care less if they banned bump fire stocks. iirc it hasn't been used  in a homicide more than 1. But I digress, that's a red herring. What else has been proposed

2607 2018-11-09 20:46:35 Trading Stocks and Crypto is not a Zero Sum Game.  One trader buys a stock in speculation that it will rise.  He buys it from a trader that is selling a profit.  The price rises and the first trader also makes money.  Trading futures is a zero sum game.

2610 2018-11-09 20:45:23 Not trying to provoke, but what proposals did the NRA shoot down? I have no doubt that there is corruption in politics, but bump fire stocks are really not an issue. It doesnt guarantee a rate of fire increase, and makes rifles much less accurate. But that's neither here nor 1/2
2611 2018-11-09 20:44:22 Achieving big returns consistently is more about risk control than finding big winning stocks. Until you understand and put into practice the concept I call "incremental risk taking", you will experience excessive drawdowns that undermine your performance.

2615 2018-11-09 20:41:28 There are many sensible proposals on the table, but they all get fought by the NRA—and what the NRA wants, the GOP gives. Remember when Trump said he was for banning bump stocks, then changed his mind after meeting with the NRA? The @GOP is in the @NRA's pocket.

2633 2018-11-09 20:30:46 I think it’s REALLY IMPERATIVE to regulate bullets just like Sudafed. People can have all the bump stocks and mail order AKs but if they can only buy 20 bullets a year we don’t have this mass shooter issue.

2639 2018-11-09 20:28:58 I don't really understand the point of disinvestment. If we reduce fossil fuel consumption, fossil fuel stocks will reduce in value; if we don't reduce fossil fuel consumption, the stocks will still be valuable to *someone*. Am I missing something?

2689 2018-11-09 20:08:35 The guy is just a twisted, sick ideologue who is basically hurting Trump by keeping stocks depressed over China worries. Attacking the Chinese economy is also hurting the US, not just China.

2759 2018-11-09 19:34:40 No one is talking about the fact that the middle class and below still hasn't recovered from 2008. Despite the oft described "booming" economy... those who don't own stocks still haven't come close to returning to 2008 wealth.
2760 2018-11-09 19:34:39 Or interpret it? We interpret the rest, right? 

Putting people in stocks and throwing fruit at them is considered cruel & unusual in 2018... for better or worse. It wasn't in 1779.

2790 2018-11-09 19:20:44 At the very least, Ar-15’s, bump stocks, extended ammunition magazines.... these should all be reclassified as WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION because that is what they are.  They are not guns or rifles.  Reform needs to happen now!
2791 2018-11-09 19:19:28  can’t say I was proud of it...it’s my release so that I can have normal productive conversations in person. Otherwise I’d be talking pot stocks and Trump with people who could careless for either.
2792 2018-11-09 19:19:27 Are you familiar with red flag laws? And why are bump stocks still legal? Why did he have a large capacity mag? How did he get it? Oh yea... online, gun shows and other states with weak laws. Come on now. Help solve the problem and stop the ignorant arguments.
2793 2018-11-09 19:18:50 I think there are many gun owners that would be open to laws such as mental health checks on ppl trying to purchase firearms. I have no problem with bans on bump stocks, suppressors, etc. But the extreme parties will fight and never compromise on their beliefs.

2886 2018-11-09 18:27:02 Market Update;

So, the entire ramp post elections was just a short squeeze on the tech stocks and bull traps for the retails, enabling the Smart money dumping their stocks

Absolutely not supported by any fundamentals

I will not be surprised, this pattern continues into 2019..
2887 2018-11-09 18:27:01 Let an industry with 10,000 employees 0.05% of GDP should guide our decision making.
Before the EU, we had decimated our fish stocks, which led to the cod wars and we're still not averse to doing a bit of poaching. Ano Brexit myth govt control fishing quota, sell to foreign.
2888 2018-11-09 18:26:39 There is an entire new class of inv since 2009 (mostly since mid year 2016) who do not believe this stuff. The believe stocks one course - higher. Nov rally reaffirmed this belief. It is wrong of course and won't be broken until they are broken. Same applies to money managers
2889 2018-11-09 18:26:24 They use 45. caliber Glocks with extended mags and AR's with bump stocks in the Olympics? I learn something new every day...
2890 2018-11-09 18:26:01 Is this related to NSEL-FTIL usurping / siphoning Rs65 Crore for which contempt proceedings have been directed? Is this about the 10Jul13 presentation that fraud accused mastermind made to DCA, alongside his Defaulter friends on Rs6K crore stocks in NSEL Warehouses? Speak loud.

2893 2018-11-09 18:25:02 Where's the spin behind the coin? ... Digital assets (whether it be stocks or digital currencies, or other paper assets) are driven by public marketing and spin. You can have the best mouse trap, but it don't matter if the marketing world ain't behind it. Perception is valuable.

2898 2018-11-09 18:22:12 Ah, I see it. Autos are already banned in the US. I’m not on board for banning semiautos though, although I could get behind banning very large clips and bump stocks.
2899 2018-11-09 18:21:49 Definitely shouldve shorted my sillybandz stocks in the 5th grade.

2901 2018-11-09 18:21:44 Why does Evian taste so awful. . .with the hurricanes, this was some of what was left in the store when I went and I got it just to make sure I had something stockpiled, and now that I'm moving through those stocks. . .I actually cringe at the idea of having to drink this.

2903 2018-11-09 18:20:42 Also from Bogle:

“Don’t rebalance”
“Just invest in US stocks”
“There are no size/value premiums”

Bogle is 30% good and 70% bad, with your quote also in the 70% category. I’d quit using it if I were you, it’s easily disproved.
2904 2018-11-09 18:20:37 Key there is its not main attraction but nice try to compare apples to buckets of puke. had they done what cyberpunk or fallout did announced a REAL game and also announced DI mobile as extra there would be 0 issues and theres no argument against that. As is stocks are plummeting
2905 2018-11-09 18:20:27 Here's something weird, yesterday I spoke to my father about stocks we invested in, how they were doing well, yesterday TD Ameritrade called me and POW= PLUMMETED.. These are all OTC, yet last month been doing great.. Till I spoke to TD Ameritrade, coincidence?
2906 2018-11-09 18:20:24 Happens in all markets. It’s human instinct to “protect” your cash. Clever traders use this opportunity to buy discounted stocks
2907 2018-11-09 18:19:43 Bump stocks don’t even make your firearm accurate. 

Also banning add on’s or accessories on firearms is a bad thing. Now they can ban triggers, scopes, handgrips. 

It’s ridiculous people who know nothing about firearms can have this much input.

2914 2018-11-09 18:15:26 I'm cracking up imagining Boehner's corporate overlord telling him, "Sure, we'll pay for you to push our stocks, but you have to try our product first." Could very well explain why he said his "position has evolved" or whatever his exact words were.
2915 2018-11-09 18:15:12 Stocks down and crypto down. Why do they correlate or where is the money going? Will it come to crypto during the weekend? Oh yeah I forgot you have to wait 3 days to receive your money when you transfer funds out of your stock account to your bank account.
2916 2018-11-09 18:14:36 Can someone please give me a heads up when @coinbase @CoinbaseSupport stocks go public. Please and thank you
2917 2018-11-09 18:14:30 While health insurance company stocks soared after the mid term elections and CNBC crowed about their future, the reality is that the reason for the optimism is zero regulation of downstream risk shifted to doctors and patients. All profits. % of doctors burned out will rise.
2918 2018-11-09 18:14:23 Actually, markets are mostly down. US energy stocks dropped by 20% over the last 5 weeks, i believe.
I actually think the waivers granted to some countries do explain the barrel at 60$. They'll probably move up at some point...
2919 2018-11-09 18:12:44 One major difference between Brazil and Canada? Banking. I am always surprised with how long I have to wait to withdraw cash at a machine. I still dont really know why... are people trading stocks on these machines?! Meu deus.
2920 2018-11-09 18:09:48 EXO has its own channel, and unsubbing SMs main channel isnt really that big of a deal. SM probably doesnt even care about it. They NEVER cared about fans complains, unless their stocks have fallen due to negative media reports. They really dont care about youtube...or us 
2921 2018-11-09 18:09:23 Maybe you haven't heard of a shooting that happened in Las Vegas? It was a pretty big deal in the news and notability the shooter had a few bump stocks
2922 2018-11-09 18:09:14 Me too. Same for a public company’s quarterly earnings. Now, every 3-4 months the stock market is thrown into chaos based on the quarterly results of individual stocks or market sectors.

Our advice: Lock in or prepare to close ALL stocks you don't want to own in 2019 by then.

2928 2018-11-09 18:02:55 Our president isn’t doing “nothing”, he’s just not doing what you want him to do. He’s been working with congress to try and pass school saftey bills, and trying to ban bump stocks

2930 2018-11-09 18:02:07 Now we’re getting somewhere. Yes, share buy backs are a good use of capital...if you’re a holder of capital. The average joe in America is not. Only 52% of US adults own stocks and rate is declining. And ownership is skewed towards the wealthy too.

2940 2018-11-09 17:58:31 I and the vast majority of vapers haven't touched a product made by BigT since we stopped smoking. Products from tobacco companies make up ~15% of the vaping market.

It's why the rumors that @SGottliebFDA is going to out major restrictions on e-cigs is rallying tobacco stocks.

2945 2018-11-09 17:56:07 Thomas, you better have a lot of put options for those dips you bought. Remember you projected gains while at JPM the year before the crash. The stock market is looking very shakey again right now. Crypto has based out, but big hedges on stocks or get short!

2955 2018-11-09 17:50:06 Theres a bit of a difference though.

2978 2018-11-09 17:40:01 I don’t need to consult anyone, and I’m not a doctor either.

3004 2018-11-09 17:28:43 I love watching the Snapchat stories of  my friends still getting fucked up in college as I’m trading stocks for my ROTH IRA retirement fund. HOLD ONTO YOUR YOUTH KIDS! ITS FLEETING!
3005 2018-11-09 17:28:28 He also made bump stocks legal so none of it is adding up. Signing meaningless orders with zero follow through to appease his family.
3006 2018-11-09 17:28:08 I think the crazy thing is your premature victory laps over your investment strategies. YoY, even Bitcoin is outperforming gold. Mining stocks are crushed. And you still have the gall to call people who point out PM manipulation as conspiracy theorists.

3008 2018-11-09 17:26:53 Bumb stocks were illegal.  So maybe we should outlaw pressure  cookers and ball bearings huh?   Those  Muslims didn't  ar 15s and ak47s

3016 2018-11-09 17:23:53 Bet it ain’t as bad as an AR 15 with extended mags and bump stocks pointed at innocent concert fans in Vegas. Bet it ain’t as bad as a pistol being unloaded in a small country bar. Bet it ain’t as bad as an AR pointed at toddlers, or elementary kids, or high school.....

3018 2018-11-09 17:22:39 Also, ban bump stocks, do not allow silencers to become legal as the NRA wants. Could go further, but this is all a good start.
3019 2018-11-09 17:22:32 Bryer personally as a democrat who want's gun reform when I say reform I literally mean something as simple as banning bump stocks. If we can't agree to ban certain types of gun, then we need to regulate who gets them and how they will be held accountable for owning one.
3020 2018-11-09 17:21:47 Here we diverge. I own AR-15s but am meh on bump stocks. If you want to waste ammo and ruin your gun, be my guest. BTW full-auto is still legally available; plenty of em in use at my range. You just need a hefty bank account to purchase and use. And none of this stops bad people.

3032 2018-11-09 17:17:33 For sure my friend. In my opinion, the most powerful in both stocks & crypto. The larger time frames are more telling, but even small timeframes can aid you well. I could trade on nothing but those two & be successful. By far the two more powerful indicators. #TA

3039 2018-11-09 17:14:24 I agree with mental health. But I also don't think there is a logical need for bump stocks and AR-15s. So many layers.
3040 2018-11-09 17:14:20 The dollar is boosted by the PPI data but yields are falling probably because investors are switching from stocks to bonds.

3047 2018-11-09 17:12:48 Since that's impossible politically (though not constitutionally), I'd love to:
- Ban assault weapons, high capacity magazines, bump stocks
- Require proper storage
- Mandate smart guns
- Mandatory, rigorous training
- Universal background checks...
3048 2018-11-09 17:12:45 I explained as I have numerous times that T/A verified is a program that updates the share structures how is that hating? It applies to all stocks who use that TA. Would you rather it go up artificially then go right back down? The more people that understand the better.

3136 2018-11-09 16:44:02 Tulsa, Oklahoma 1921 is the first domestic terror attack against the black community at large. It promoted the primary dismantling of an economic boom of black products and stocks. which by definition is Racism due to its affect on power structures and infrastructure.

3138 2018-11-09 16:43:52 I got that it was a 10yr law, however assault weapons are auto (not semi-auto) and are still illegal. Bump stocks are trash and no one uses them. Only made notable by Vegas shooter, had 20+ semi-auto rifles needed to produce carnage. Ban them, no gun enthusiast will care.

3143 2018-11-09 16:42:18 You appear to be suggesting that local/national control of stocks equal a mad bonanza followed by dearth.
I suggest:
The CFP leads to huge bycatch issues, up to 40% thrown back, plus damage to non EU fishermen.
Local control of any resource is likely to minimise pointless waste.

3158 2018-11-09 16:36:53 Glad I sold covered calls vs my long positions in certain names yesterday e.g. QURE NIO, helps to cushion the downside on days like this. Stocks will likely rebound in coming days/weeks, but the premium collected will rapidly approach 0 as theta destroys their value.

3208 2018-11-09 16:16:19 There are nearly no automatic weapons in the US in civilian hands, only bullshit "bump stocks" that turn an accurate weapon into a vibrating mess. My point is, knives are not the only alternative to guns for homocides. Much worse things are.
3209 2018-11-09 16:16:06 You do not need a semiautomatic rifle or bump stocks for home defense or hunting. In hunting you want to take out your prey with 1 kill shot. In home defense you don’t want to blow your house to bits but using a semiautomatic rifle you want to stop an assault
3210 2018-11-09 16:15:48 Ok. Step 1: nobody needs anything more than a handgun, period. Step 2:  thorough background checks that last up to a year. Step 3: eliminating ALL abilities to modify guns. No bump stocks or any other unnecessary shit. Step 4: close monitoring on gun owners whereabouts

3398 2018-11-09 15:02:04 #Stocks/#bonds, correlation: Key inflection points were 1960 & 2015. In ’60, the 5-year swung from persistently positive to negative & hovered there until the late ‘90s when a deflationary mindset set in. Then the correlation was positive again (except for ‘09), peaking in 2015.
3399 2018-11-09 15:02:02 The CFP has systematically destroyed stocks. It is widely recognised as an environmental disaster. We have no legal obligation to pay anything beyond Mar 2019 - and EU demand the cash regardless of future agreement which may or may not reduce trade friction.

3415 2018-11-09 14:56:20 Today focus will be on #inflation via PPI and it needs to remain “Goldilocks” so as to not put more downward pressure on stocks. We also have several Fed speakers (Williams, Harker, Quarles) although the next big Fed event will be Fed Chair Powell speaking on Tuesday.

3426 2018-11-09 14:53:40 NRA money in politics will keep this happening. It will get worse as weapons get faster and deadlier. Restrict and license extended clips, exploding rounds, bump stocks, and assault weapons. Require licenses for gun owners, with more qualifications for deadlier weapons.
3427 2018-11-09 14:53:10 We need consistent regulation and enforcement. Close loopholes in background checks. Waiting periods—you can wait for a gun if you have a legit reason for one. No semi-autos, no bump stocks. That would be a good start.

3435 2018-11-09 14:51:40 Really? Stock price moves are not a reflection of earnings reports. Companies like FDX, ETFC and HEAR have reported above consensus earnings, raised guidance and their stocks still got hammered.
3436 2018-11-09 14:51:23 it is seen most mutual funds were low inspite of nifty gaining in recent past. that was bcoz nifty rally was bcoz of 5 stocks. hence i recommend index fund , below tweet lists the index funds ,i am personally investing in uti nifty index fund

3440 2018-11-09 14:48:52 Gun violence has gone up from 10-12% in the last two years. We also need to ban bump stocks and after market alterations that enable guns to shoot way more bullets and much faster. Gun are not fucking toys! We need to stop treating them like they are in America. People are dying.

3443 2018-11-09 14:48:07 It's been reported that the gun the shooter wielded had an illegal magazine. High capacity magazines should be illegal for all types of weapons. Automatic & semiautomatic weapons are for killing people not deer. Outlaw them & bump stocks. Need gun show regulations. Simple stuff
3444 2018-11-09 14:48:05 Daniel disagrees with us ... but we think $RRGB and $DENN the next two restaurant stocks to see LBOs ... $LOCO and $FRGI should merge (synergies). if something like $FOGO saw a bid, anything possible.

3448 2018-11-09 14:45:05 I thought the vegas shooter bought all his guns legally, the store even spoke out about it. He bought multiple rifles at once which didn't need to be reported like it must be reported when buying multiple handguns. He also bought several legal bump stocks that made them automatic

3504 2018-11-09 14:30:28 I think today will be key to seeing how investor sentiment will affect stocks after yesterdays FED meeting. The stocks are going to start low, but if they stay low I would expect them to remain that way through December. #investing #FAANG $FANG $FAANG #stockmarket #stocks

3519 2018-11-09 14:24:13 They’re being leveraged like equities because, wait for it, they are equities. I’m also pretty sure that a portfolio of junk bonds is less volatile than many individual stocks, which Mr. Baron seems to approve of levering if I’m not misinterpreting him.

3522 2018-11-09 14:23:20 And we knew this maaaan smh, This is simply about exchange operation regulation and kyc stuff. Companies selling centralized tokens have to jump through all the legal hoops just like if it were stocks. This isnt about crypto or Bitcoin & litecoin that no one owns or can control.
3523 2018-11-09 14:22:30 How many ppl talk about stocks that has hit almost ZERO ? 
Coz stock market is pump and dump mostly. 
Only consumer stocks and the company which upgrades itself will sustain.
Why talk about whole stock market when you know only few good things avail for Long-term ?

3533 2018-11-09 14:18:37 seems like it is best to find the stocks that are either really bullish or really bearish, but of course easier said than done...

3535 2018-11-09 14:17:39 Thoughts & prayers, send them to politicians -register gun owners, extended magazines illegal, close gun show loopholes, stop gun retailers from selling guns when waiting period elapses, outlaw bump stocks, raise gun purchase age to 21, prosecute owners when guns aren't secured.
3536 2018-11-09 14:17:22 So I think I’m going to really teach myself about stocks and bonds. I’m very interested in learning how I can invest and make money off of other companies.

3556 2018-11-09 14:08:33 If you're in your 20s or 30s, it pays to have a heavy exposure to equities (stocks and shares). They generally put in the best growth over the long term, but conversely, they can also experience dramatic falls. Free #pension advice #peterfa

3589 2018-11-09 13:46:55 I don't 100% agree, but I don't think we do enough.  Assault rifles and bump stocks, for example, ought to be banned from civilian use.

1) can be easily made at home
2) are not usually used in gun massacres

Nothing will be done now . People will say "thoughts and prayers". Then another massacre will happen, rinse and repeat.

3618 2018-11-09 13:38:03 The problem is most of us want sensible gun laws. But any time people talk about stricter background checks, longer waiting periods, illegal to sell bump stocks, etc, the NRA pays people off to make sure that never happens. And gun owners act like their guns are being taken away

3749 2018-11-09 12:24:07 I'm still having a problem with transferring stocks to new broke. One of my holding is nontransferable without giving any valid reason from Apex/@AskRobinhood.

3761 2018-11-09 12:16:43 Convertible notes are issued at a premium, if done now, would be at a convertible price of say, $160. So less dilution to existing shareholders. But harder for the company b/c of interest on the notes. As for manipulation, it’s the same either convertible or stocks issuance.

3772 2018-11-09 12:06:10 U.S. stocks on Friday were set to end the week lower, with equity-index futures on track to open lower a day after the Federal Reserve held interest rates steady, as expected, and appeared to affirm expectations for a hike to interest rates in December.
3773 2018-11-09 12:06:01 You cant demolish a building with a 100 round MAG and a bump stock. I personally believe bump stocks should be added to the FFL.
3774 2018-11-09 12:05:42 Looks like you have little understanding of demand and supply economics. Stick to penny stocks my good friend or educate yourself.
3775 2018-11-09 12:05:30 NRA didn’t advocate for bump stocks before Las Vegas and didn’t object to them being banned afterward.  Educate yourself on the facts before entering the debate please.
3776 2018-11-09 12:00:48 From what i hear it was planned for when regulations were passed and xRapid goes live. xRapid is live. Waiting for regulations and @CoinMarketCap to stop treating utility tokens like stocks.
3777 2018-11-09 12:00:23 You don't need weapons of war, extended magazines or bump stocks to hunt. The NRA is a terrorist supporting organization. It's time for its law-abiding sane members to step in. Is this what you want?

3783 2018-11-09 11:59:04 Historically, when large cap safety stocks outperform, while smaller and more speculative plays exhibit extended weakness, it usually signifies an impending correction or bear market. The strategy: ride large cap gainers until they begin to roll over.

Never had I observed so high number.This means "price wasnt right" in those stocks...market fell!
3788 2018-11-09 11:55:04 Thanks to @KeithMcCullough, @HedgeyeDDale and all the talented macro analysts at @Hedgeye for keeping me unemotional in my trading strategies and focused on the data. I went short stocks at the top of the S&P risk range and bottom of VIX two days ago and long bonds yesterday.
3789 2018-11-09 11:53:49 It’s a Republican/NRA thing. They have blocked any and all changes to gun laws touting 2nd amendment rights. I get the right to bear arms but not having national policies on universal background checks, elimination of bump stocks and military style automatic weapons is lunacy.
3790 2018-11-09 11:53:30 I remember their argument being something like "we need to ban bump stocks because it makes the gun shoot in full semi automatic". I could be wrong but from every gun nut I've talked to I was told that they don't even work most of the time.
3791 2018-11-09 11:52:47 I’ve been thinking about investing in stocks

3874 2018-11-09 10:27:33 So, couple of flaws. Firstly, fish swim about (listening at the back, Rabb?). They don’t stay in territorial waters and one nation can wipe out the stocks of another by taking young fish early in a season. Secondly, British fisherman sold most of their licenses to the Spanish.
3875 2018-11-09 10:24:12 And if you look further at wider world economy Australia struggling, Japan posted a shocking decline in household consumption earlier this week.... not looking good. What’s your plan then, selling stocks and holding cash?

3902 2018-11-09 10:03:37 UBS 1/2: The bull market is clearly getting more mature, & this stage of the cycle is typically associated with both higher volatility &more modest scope for further gains. But we believe that value offered by global stocks justifies tolerating the potential for higher volatility

3907 2018-11-09 10:02:19 UBS: recent sell-off has also led to a deterioration in technical picture – market momentum is weak, #volatility is higher & credit spreads have widened.

3934 2018-11-09 09:26:35 If you look at a longer term chart you’ll see that oil & stocks are not very correlated at all (see 2013-mid 2017). It all depends on the drivers and they’re typically not the same. 2nd point: lower oil tends to mean lower bond yields, which should be positive equities currently.

3936 2018-11-09 09:25:20 Regardless of price action setup, my humble advice is to stay away from stocks which have given continuous lower circuits in the recent past. There is something wrong in it and you may not get proper exit once you enter.

3981 2018-11-09 08:54:45 Actually this is an incredible behaviour change from Indian investors. It means many things. 1.Investors have enough spare savings to dabble in stocks 2. They see current turbulence as temporary indicating confident of future 3. Continued depression in Real estate sector...
3982 2018-11-09 08:53:47 wow! guess 300 mass shootings a year is nothing against a handful of mass stabbings! 10 people with knives killing 29 is comparable to one person with bump stocks on their rifles killing 50 in a couple of minutes! gun control is SOLVED!!!!

4003 2018-11-09 08:38:31 Hi Alex! Yes, you will find Chanel available in our @WorldDutyFree, which stocks both fragrance and makeup.  Thank you.
4004 2018-11-09 08:37:39 contrarian view on UK bank stocks is that no other country practiced such regulatory vendetta against its banks and therefore balance sheets are much more scrutinised and valuations lower than for example Scandinavia. i know which one I'd be long/short
4005 2018-11-09 08:36:33 And since the 2A doesn't state which arms you can have, the gov can ban certain models & types, if they can ban Lawn Darts & Certain Drugs, they can ban certain types of guns, ammo and/or accessories like bump stocks. @NRA #guncontrolnow
4006 2018-11-09 08:36:20 Tried and tested mid-high price stocks are much more reliable, they are consistent as they 'trade by the book'.
4007 2018-11-09 08:34:27 Fed did not tighten today, and is approaching end of the QT. This is enough for a relief rally for November until December FOMC meeting. The targets are modest. The stocks are likely to come under pressure in 2019 again though...
4008 2018-11-09 08:34:19 Thanks for the kind advise. Really appreciate.
4009 2018-11-09 08:33:32 Ooo Trump has been a very naughty boy! Making claims and taking credit when the rends for employment, stocks and the like were already on the rise way before he won the presidential election. And he needs to look after his people not split them
4010 2018-11-09 08:31:08 How soon can we decriminalise the ENTIRE industry. Start taxing it. Land, labour, climate, market = we have it all. Investors rushed to Canadian cannabis stocks. This costs govt NOTHING but brings in Billions. Ask them what they value a future industry to be worth.
4011 2018-11-09 08:30:28 And now gentlemen is when you short the stocks, if you are not its you are slow and you will lose mark my words!
4012 2018-11-09 08:29:55 Do you realise that buying stocks could be double edged swords for us? ELF bought 1% stocks for SJ then what? Henry&Zhoumi being blocked to be permanent part of SJ, Sungmin unable to return to SJ after he announced his marriage. This clearly isn't a wise decision. #AlwaysWithEXO
4013 2018-11-09 08:28:36 A lot of good quality small and midcaps have recovered good grounds and further will do well. As I always say,forget the markets and concentrate on individual stocks. It’s the stocks and not the markets which will make you richer. Happy investing.

4088 2018-11-09 07:24:21 That may be true, but more often than not it’s because of stocks not being over. It’s coz of the reasons you’ve mentioned you have a time frame of 2-3 days. Beyond that it becomes hard to sensitise to everyone’s different needs because it’s physically agitating me.

4098 2018-11-09 07:17:50 This is a multi-faceted issue and needs to be treated as such.

Lack of dovish surprises in FOMC statement, elimination of election risk and easing of finacial conditions increase odds of Dec hike (GS). Most points of TSY curve at/near their highest yields (MS). USD up

4129 2018-11-09 06:52:21 I do understand the 4 to 5 day window can become nuisance and it is your right to complain. But it is not always about getting rid of stocks. Some may be to just make a kid happy. Others could be to accommodate different times when people will or can celebrate.

4152 2018-11-09 06:32:48 Accounting and academics aside, my focus was more on invested assets (stocks, Sacco deposits, FDs, T Bills, Bonds, Unit trusts, real estate, pension benefits,), all the others are just depreciating assets and "nice to haves".

4157 2018-11-09 06:30:19 Actually there are two areas not mention but also need to be addressed. Bump stocks and military style weapons do not need to be in the American Public hands.

4160 2018-11-09 06:28:46 Hua? We were talking about the media destroying its self. Did you mean to leave this to a different thread? I  never said that Trump was self made. In fact he is actually a very poor business man in my opinion. He would have made more money by simply putting his money in stocks
4161 2018-11-09 06:28:43 Bullcrap!

Pres Trump has been fighting for VETS to get mental health care, PTSD care & not 1 DEM voted yes!
He also called for banning bump stocks & modifying manufacturers guns!

buying stocks to have control - that's not how stocks work and it isn't that easy + it's not the reason why sj has more freedom than exo.

4229 2018-11-09 05:35:28 bump stocks are only illegal in 7 states, and background checks are not required at any gun show and also they are not thorough at all when taken place. and in florida its easier to buy an AR-15 than it is to buy a handgun. in many states it takes under an hour to get an AR-15
4230 2018-11-09 05:35:14 Like, a lot of the requested change is just common sense!! Why is there such a backlash to expanding background checks? Or what civilian needs bump stocks? Or requiring that your household gun be securely stored?

4246 2018-11-09 05:25:41 Ok so, bump stocks are already illegal, background checks are required, high power and semi automatic weapons both fall under a broad category. What do you categorize as a “military grade weapon” because it certainly isn’t an easy task to obtain a fully automatic weapon

4258 2018-11-09 05:19:11 Consumer stocks corrected unusually fast this time for two reasons:
1. The gains were big and rapid leading to some froth.
2. Companies cautioned on sales/profits when crude went to 85
With crude falling hard, this sector is well positioned to rally again

4283 2018-11-09 04:59:29 Ban bump stocks and AR’s. AR’s are for war zones and hunting people not deer. Mandatory background checks and waiting periods. People guilty of violent crimes ineligible to own guns. You know, common sense. it’s more difficult to vote in parts of the US than it is to buy a gun.

A "bump stock" was supposedly used at Las Vegas but that story still makes no sense. Bump stocks are highly inaccurate and just a waste you can do something with your belt loop.

4300 2018-11-09 04:47:52 I think AR15 should be banned and bump stocks. However, as far as shootings are concerned Canada is 1/10 population of USA. Lastly. there are many illegal guns currently on the streets. What #Canada does not have are religious fanatics, likes of KKK and also gun culture period.
4301 2018-11-09 04:46:40 And in front of that line in the Mass. A.G. Mass. is the 1st state to ban bump stocks for AR 15s.
4302 2018-11-09 04:45:26 The market doesn’t like volatility. Never has. Wonder what it will look like tomorrow. Maybe, hospital stocks up. Pot will be in the green ..
4303 2018-11-09 04:44:48 apparently they already tried to do it but they are not selling their stocks 
4304 2018-11-09 04:44:25 That's why i said it will not stop shootings but look into this past 2 years -  Numerous killed by Semi-Automatic Guns, Bump Stocks - Could've been Saved by Stricter Gun Regulations.

4306 2018-11-09 04:42:59 i don’t have enough characters for this. for starters, outlaw high powered semi automatic rifles, bump stocks, assault rifles and other military grade weapons. require a thorough background checks at least one gun-safety course for anything else.

4312 2018-11-09 04:40:19 I don’t know the answers otherwise higher ups probably would too.

4356 2018-11-09 04:12:18 Reasonable gun control.  Mental health checks, 30 day waiting period and no access to AR15 style weapons or bump stocks.  Support weapon buy-backs of ALL auto weapons. We do not need military style weapons nor ammunition.

4363 2018-11-09 04:09:43 When Trump met with the victims & parents of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas HS,& had his photo op, he said he was going 2 outline a gun control & school safety program that includes expanded background checks, eliminating bump stocks.
4364 2018-11-09 04:09:35 My opinion- there’s no real answer. Can limit access to certain guns not necessary for hunting or protection. Can raise age minimum to 21. Make bump stocks illegal. And so on
4365 2018-11-09 04:09:08 I'm amazed at your optimism that we could ever get a federal ban on bump stocks
4366 2018-11-09 04:08:04 Didn't trump already tell the ATF to start treating bump stocks as violating the NFA?
4367 2018-11-09 04:07:30 $AYTU stocks drop and stocks pop.
4368 2018-11-09 04:07:14 I don't. She thinks people like me are evil. I'm not raiding her house. I just want mandatory gun safety classes, background checks, a ban on bump stocks and military grade weapons, and other sensible gun measures.
4369 2018-11-09 04:07:11 Hopefully, the truth will set them free.
Failing that, invest heavily in Big Pharma stocks,
because they're going to need a lot of meds
as soon as the FISAs, 302s, etc., are released.

Most of them do not even realize yet
that General Flynn was fully exonerated.
4370 2018-11-09 04:06:56 @sgurumurthy Bizarre logic.  GDP increased by ~300% from 2004-14 and 9.8% was annual rate.  You should same metric like you did for stocks. gold, land etc.  Just on that one fallacy, your entire argument fails.

4376 2018-11-09 04:05:00 Yes, but price above say 200dma or 50dma can be a momentary filter match, but which set of filters or indicators can one filter for to narrow down to a few tickers to match stocks with a long term uptrend? ie more consistent price action.

The federal cabinet on Thursday decided to separate revenue collection administration from tax policy formation to promote equity and transparency in the tax machinery.
4381 2018-11-09 04:02:38 I agree.  Somewhere, somehow, there has to be some common sense, middle ground.  I can’t believe there is nothing between hunting and protecting your home, or sport, for that matter, and AR’s and bumper stocks being sold like Skitttles.
4382 2018-11-09 04:02:29 Stacks, $QCA has a better basket of stocks than $CGOC at this point, especially with how redundant the latter's holdings are with the rest of your portfolio. Do some DD, or for a quick take, check out my tweet replies lately, which are all about it.

Stocks were down to 7000 and 401k accounts lost 30, 40, 50% of their value. It’s naive to think we had options.

4402 2018-11-09 03:49:14 But stocks in tissues I say.
4403 2018-11-09 03:49:07 We agree. Well, most. But when you have a complicit repub Congress who's scared to death they will lose their campaign finance money from the @NRA, it will never change. Bump stocks still are not banned after Vegas shooting like lying trump said.
4404 2018-11-09 03:48:21 isn’t this what selling stocks is?
4405 2018-11-09 03:47:24 Yes as a trader that's true. We are not investors. We take advantage of short term price volatility. It doesn't matter what the financial asset is. But an investment offers a yield (stocks, property, bonds) &/or growth based on solid fundamentals or at least scarcity.
4406 2018-11-09 03:44:24 Such good news everywhere we have to get to 3010. Interest Rates higher positive. Dollar stronger positive.  Faang stocks smacked positive. Oil and gas down big positive.

4427 2018-11-09 03:28:38 No, the point of gun control is to limit, control certain guns from being sold, what’s to say they won’t remove handguns? Shotguns, rifles? Hell they banned Bump stocks, which is probably the most idiot thing I’ve heard in my life! Have you shot a gun, owned a gun?
4428 2018-11-09 03:28:22 The single best time to use the Twisted Sister is when volatility skew inverts, meaning calls are trading richer than puts. This normally happens in breakout stocks after a parabolic move to the upside.
4429 2018-11-09 03:28:18 I totally agree with SG. Yes, In 2004-10, stocks rose by 338%, gold by 332%, and land by 300 to 2100%,  GDP by 9.8%, prices by 6.8%, jobs by just 1.7m. CAD 2004-14 USD 360b. This was to cheat Indians & enrich Cheaters/LOOTERS :(

We want sensible laws for owning a gun.
We want sensible laws for buying a gun. 
We want military style guns off our streets in America 
We want a ban on bump stocks. 
We want ppl to be taught safety while owning a gun.
4457 2018-11-09 03:06:32 It is and should be. But state-by-state there are different laws. And there are loopholes, like for gunshows, bump stocks, no fly lists. Background checks still aren't universal. Age limits are diff. state-to-state. If someone can just drive over a state line to buy, too easy.
4458 2018-11-09 03:06:25 I was including firearm accessories in gun reform,  e.g. bump stocks, magazines etc. which was the original discussion. That's the problem, when people hear 'gun reform' the mind automatically thinks, "they're trying to take my guns!" Let's think critically outside the box.

4460 2018-11-09 03:05:35 What do you mean by "normal handguns"?

The Virginia Tech shooter killed 32 with two low power normal handguns. Today's shooter in California used a somewhat higher power but still normal handgun. 

No bump stocks. Not rifles.

I don't enjoy shooting. It's not pleasant.

We went thru this a year ago - nearly to the day - with the Las Vegas massacre. He claimed he was for stronger gun laws and banning bump stocks. 

He did nothing. He's still done nothing.

4476 2018-11-09 02:51:11 #Stocks,#Indexes The SPX top signal is too weak to end such a rally. It is clear the ongoing rally is not what SPX signaled on 11.06 at 2650, that signal being too minor. The present strong rally was signaled by SPX bottom signal on 10.25 at 2698 (see chart). It will continue.

4479 2018-11-09 02:49:53 Trump likes the fact that stock prices are inflated by the government giving companies money to buy their own stocks. It creates the illusion of wealth, which is the essence of Trump.
4480 2018-11-09 02:48:19 wonder if it's worth keeping these 2 game stocks until the holidays in hopes of a boost.  Been holding these stocks for so long, I seem to never find a right time to dump them more then they are worth. Recycling the dividends in them make it harder to let go.
4481 2018-11-09 02:46:41 Is this the same Jeff Sessions that every leftist was so out of their freaking Minds about when he was first appointed? Trump controls them like brainless wind-up toys. They are the laughing stocks of humanity!

4488 2018-11-09 02:42:15 Considering stocks only go up/down/sideways; traders can only go long/short; and we all see the same charts, if a trader has an idea to go long/short at a certain area, whether that trader shares their "idea" or not, their trade won't be the only print on the tape in that area.

4490 2018-11-09 02:39:36 If people are going to break the law anyway, why can't we ban bump stocks and military grade rifles?

Republicans like Reagan supported gun control measures like these. Bush even turned in his NRA card.

4498 2018-11-09 02:33:47 Very thankful to you for bringing this article to my notice. It's a pity though that you don't see the relationship between black money and increase in asset prices- gold land and stocks.
4499 2018-11-09 02:32:24 advertising talaga siya pero investment company tlga siya and they basically buy stocks for u in large companies like recently disney n force the company to give equal pay. cool siya hahah
4500 2018-11-09 02:31:42 Yeah but the whole setup with the contracts is such a bait and switch.  I always wondered why he is able to short stocks where it’s nearly impossible to borrow the shares.  This explains it all.
4501 2018-11-09 02:30:40 Universal background checks, a national gun registry, banning of assault weapons, a large surcharge on every gun and all ammunition sold to pay for additional mental health screenings, banned bump stocks, NATIONAL red flag laws, raising the minimum age to 21 to purchase firearms

4503 2018-11-09 02:27:37 So while we pick away at solving the “deeper” problems, how ‘bout we not let the “problems” play with AR-15s?? Or bump stocks?
4504 2018-11-09 02:27:29 I love trying an investment & am invested in stocks, my businesses, many residential properties, at least 5 of my friends companies, day traders, even a classic Ferrari & a movie that's being made...but #crypto I just don't get. Nobody has been able sell it to me yet.

4507 2018-11-09 02:25:37 Don’t worry. Trump said 3 weeks ago that an executive order would be signed by the election to ban bump stocks. Oh that’s right, another lie.

Where is your anger about the police officer that died!?  That at least gets you somewhat close to human occasionally.

4524 2018-11-09 02:14:31 U.S. Market Check

    Stocks fell and the dollar extended gains after the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged while confirming it was still on course to hike in December.

    The yield on 10-year Treasuries fell one basis point to 3.23 percent.
4525 2018-11-09 02:14:08 Stocks in Asia were little changed Friday after three days of gains and an overnight decline in their U.S. counterparts.

Benchmarks in Japan, Australia and South Korea tested waters, and moves in U.S. futures were muted.

Then compare that to Blizzard/Activision's bad Q3 investor call, Destiny 2 isn't doing well and their stocks are at their lowest they've ever been.
4529 2018-11-09 02:10:22 January is a good month for speculative stocks. Chart looks like it put in a double top. If I had to bet it will see $4 before it see an all time high.
4530 2018-11-09 02:09:23 Your fake concern and lack of action is telling. When your orange boss said he was for some #GunReformNow on bump stocks after Las Vegas, the NRA made a beeline to his office, slipped him some cash, and that was that. #Corruption didn’t start with tRump, but it multiplied.
4531 2018-11-09 02:09:05 Dear All,

All Asian markets shows  negative trend.Sgx nifty indicated that our market will open lower. We have a strong resistance at 10605 , if it crossed we may see levels upto 10715/10764.

Today paper stocks like Jkpaper , Ipappm can look for intraday gains.
4532 2018-11-09 02:09:04 BUMP STOCKS ARE ALREADY BANNED! read USC 18 § 922 before you come talking to me about gun laws. I'll agree we need to find a constitutional way to get more people screened, but remember Long and many other mass shooters passed theirs. There's no tracking for firearms. 1/2
4533 2018-11-09 02:08:54 What act of terrorism did they commit? Any pipe bombs? Any synagogues shot up? Did they have AR-15s with bump stocks, or did they say words to a man who spreads words of lies and hate on television nightly? If you open your mouth for a living you face the consequence.
4534 2018-11-09 02:07:43 Gun-carrying citizens are not a surplus. Only a minority carry right now.

And no, I don't own any gun stocks. Doesn't seem like a sure investment with all the liberals here, and I have Bitcoin for my high-risk investment.

4537 2018-11-09 02:06:15 Some people seem to believe th NRA saying if bump stocks,automatic weapons, AR15s are banned except for military use only, then all guns will be banned which is NOT TRUE.

4542 2018-11-09 02:02:56 I would think about multiples as the inverse of int rates/yields. 

Earnings/Price = "earnings yield".

There is opportunity cost of owning bonds vs stocks.

If bond yields go higher then stock yields go higher too.

Earnings yield go higher by earnings up or price down or both
4543 2018-11-09 02:01:02 Just left RIA event: everyone constructive on US stocks, likes EM but acknowledge the struggle with higher rates & dollar. Everyone bearish on bonds.

4545 2018-11-09 01:58:47 Why aren’t stocks an alternative? I know this is similar in Australia and NZ.
4546 2018-11-09 01:58:25 Well. . .we can't really expect the stocks to go up every day
4547 2018-11-09 01:58:16 Haha
People are starving in the streets and you want to spend money on something that is already a surplus in the US.

Gotta ask, you own any gun stocks?
4548 2018-11-09 01:57:24 Actually this is not a China issue. Same in India. It’s emblematic of peoples understanding of investable options. These populations went from buying gold to buying property. Stocks aren’t an alternative.
4549 2018-11-09 01:54:29 So about @LeVeonBell .... his stocks going down and down by the possession.
4550 2018-11-09 01:54:26 Pot stocks are not any more immune to emotional swings than any other kind of stocks, it’s true. That’s why I don’t usually recommend that people invest in them, necessarily.

4557 2018-11-09 01:49:11 Well your understanding of firearms is so fucked up. one gun shows don’t sell a weapon of war 2nd how do you convert a already semi auto to a semi auto I think you mean full auto also they ATF took care of bump stocks and its mags not clips

4569 2018-11-09 01:30:38 My larger point is if they banned bump stocks immediately after the Vegas shooting, today's shooting would have still happened and everyone would still be running around saying when are we going to do something to prevent this ?
4570 2018-11-09 01:29:40 @Ocasio2018 9/11 lots of people lost big time. The really big brokerage firms wound up sweeping all these shares of stocks and the result the richest owned more of everything. There is no middle class stock holders anymore. This motive

4573 2018-11-09 01:27:07 Let’s see . Ban bump stocks, longer and tighter laws, mental health screenings, if your gun gets in the wrong hands . You are punished! The list goes on and on ! Lock them up America
4574 2018-11-09 01:26:57 I must have missed the reporting that today's shooter used bump stocks? There's a lot of things we can ban that would save a ton of lives, knives, cars, smoking, swimming pools, dogs - maybe all of them! Wouldn't the hundreds of thousands of lives we'd save be worth it?
4575 2018-11-09 01:26:00 @alex313_carlos do you disagree with these numbers? I'm UK based so wondering about EU stocks.

4583 2018-11-09 01:16:46 Most privately owned land is owned by a tiny % of the pop. Same thing with 84% of stocks being owned by the richest 10%. The idea that this stuff is meant to help one off family farms is false. That’s just the rhetoric the right use to give themselves more tax cuts and power.

4590 2018-11-09 01:11:41 Dividends.... mostly.  ... and its not a few stocks... its most. My old targets/thresholds on stocks like $F $BAC from any further back than a year ago, all been significantly adjusted by mr market.
4591 2018-11-09 01:10:43 Banks - governments print cash more than that is required to enable transactions in the economy people will tend to absorb that into stocks-assets. This will create trading in assets abnormally. Scarcer services and commodities will cost more and lastly it ends in inflation.
4592 2018-11-09 01:10:28 Haha, we love these blockchain stocks, that we don't anticipate will make headway into the finance space.
4593 2018-11-09 01:09:55 Why don’t you work on changing our election system to online voting? Don’t tell me it’s not safe. We trade stocks, bank, shop and transfer sensitive documents online.
4594 2018-11-09 01:09:51 I hear a stock called AMY is good. Know anything about it? I've been reluctant to invest in stocks,  but you just might be the one to convince me
4595 2018-11-09 01:09:28 I knew you would say that. Not sure why that adjust data are different on just few stocks.
4596 2018-11-09 01:08:56 Life & liberty were protected by guns in 1776. Now life & liberty are threatened by guns. Why should we allow military style weapons & bump stocks on the streets of a " civilized society?”  No way the founders ever dreamed of these type of advanced weapons be in hands of public.
4597 2018-11-09 01:08:14 I don’t know if you notice but the stocks are at 24 cents!!!!...well a least I’m glad you can sleep at night but those small investors that put there’s life savings in Stornoway can’t sleep well,I guess it’s my fault then hey
4598 2018-11-09 01:05:58 Because the NRA which is now cover for gun manufacturers and other firearm accoutrements (scopes, bump stocks etc) gives millions to politicians. Mostly republicans. Who are greedy and vote against any sane regulations.

4603 2018-11-09 01:03:34 Bump stocks are fucking stupid and should be banned. That said, they’re not as functional as people make them out to be. 
They increase rate of fire slightly at massive cost in accuracy.
4604 2018-11-09 01:03:12 You sound like an expert trader. I think I’d better stick to the penny stocks where all the other noob traders are, at least I have a chance with them.
4605 2018-11-09 01:02:41 Agree!! Mental illness isn't the root of the problem. Legalized semi automatic weapons, armor-piercing bullets, bump stocks, and no gun Control ARE. 

Dems are the only Party NOT in bed with the NRA!
4606 2018-11-09 01:02:18 It’s a cute acronym they created to market stocks they think will benefit from the blockchain
4607 2018-11-09 01:02:00 So the CEO of $CVCO got fired and got an SEC subpoena for trading stock of a competitor which can only be $SKY ... can’t make this stuff up.

4627 2018-11-09 00:46:34 I'm probably the millionth person to suggest this, but invest in penny stocks to treat your EDS
4628 2018-11-09 00:46:12 The problem is the fact that enraged white men have such easy access to weapons that easily slaughter dozens of people in minutes. No one needs military grade weapons, high capacity magazines, bump stocks, etc.
4629 2018-11-09 00:43:50 On a national level? For a start: Ban bump stocks. Ban high rate of fire weapons. Ban large magazines. Gun buybacks. Rigorous background checks. Gun licensing. Wouldn't expect a 100% effectiveness rate. You'd still be able to go to the range and shoot, or go hunting.
4630 2018-11-09 00:43:41 F the 2nd Amend,  sweetheart!! No 1 wants to tread on the Constitution.. except our president..daily!  COMMON SENSE =No gun purchases if- ment. health issues, PTSD, felons, domestic abusers..remove purch. of military-type assault weapons, bump stocks to citizens.
4631 2018-11-09 00:43:36 I can not believe you literally don’t understand how the President sets policy, which is then enforced by the entirety of the executive branch, through various agencies and mechanisms of the federal government. He could ban bump stocks literally right now.
4632 2018-11-09 00:42:40 The citizens don't buy guns over there.
In America anybody in their right mind, IN THEIR WRONG MIND can buy a gun, automatic, bump stocks, no substantial background checks and nit even registered.
Law enforcement and military.......yes that makes sense.
4633 2018-11-09 00:41:39 Exactly, amateur crypto traders keep thinking that stocks should fall except for the fact that their earnings keeps growing every quarter. Stocks are backed by real fundamental use unlike the shitcoins their trading careers were raised in.

4636 2018-11-09 00:40:58 Gun packing teachers is certainly not the answer. I'm a gun owner, but something needs to be done. Banning bump-stocks and high-capacity magazines would be a good start.
4637 2018-11-09 00:40:52 Adjustable stocks-Simply allows people of varying shapes and sizes to handle a firearm safely.

These are some of several areas where lack of knowledge of firearms is the problem.

4639 2018-11-09 00:39:57 A reasonable start is limiting assault rifles and bump stocks to shooting ranges, banning gun ownership from anyone convicted of domestic abuse. None of this affects handguns, hunting rifles or shot guns. Training, registration & insurance just like other hazardous equipment.

For example you can track stocks or commodities - any such tool for inflation?
4644 2018-11-09 00:37:00 Except the NRA is making pur gun laws...They are the 3rd party...

4647 2018-11-09 00:35:00 We need better controls. Clearly. 

Get rid of large capacity magazines and semi-assault weapons and bump stocks. Close gun show loopholes. Create a national registry of guns.

4654 2018-11-09 00:31:26 Yes but you don't hear about a truck deliberately mowing down people anywhere round the world anywhere near as much as you hear about a mass shooting in America. At the very least common sense gun laws and banning the AR-15 and bump stocks should be implemented.
4655 2018-11-09 00:29:25 I’m not making excuses, but if Pelosi comes out with guns blazing, Republicans are going to retaliate with bigger guns. And theirs are equipped with bump stocks! Dems play by the rules. How do you prevail over ruthless, vicious sociopaths who have no relationship with the truth?

4664 2018-11-09 00:21:35 $SPY It's not so unusual for the major indexes to move up while some stocks go down or to watch indexes go down while some stocks move higher.  Why I focus more on individual stocks, versus putting too much focus on short term direction of the indexes
4665 2018-11-09 00:20:48 I see where flip flop Liam gets it.  Bill would not leave Steffy alone when she told him she wanted Liam.  He kept it up till she out smarted him + got back his stocks + told him she wasn't interested.  The night was a mistake he wouldn't let go of.  Flipped to Brooke now.
4666 2018-11-09 00:19:32 If you find 5 stocks that double and are aggressive (not hard to do) you can make $700,000 from $20,000 in 5 trades in < 3 years. 40, 80, 160, 320, 720. You need to think differently. But you need to know what you're doing

Now that Boehner is making millions in weed stocks, I suspect Ryan won't be too far behind. McCarthy is part of that former triumverate.

4670 2018-11-09 00:17:43 I was only clarifying what he actually used. But I’m glad you can admit, aside from this event, bump stocks should be banned. Which only certain states have banned since early this year. Trump said he would “order them out of business” which still hasn’t happened.

I’m past all that. #gunreformnow
4680 2018-11-09 00:14:05 Ban assault rifles, bump stocks, & large capacity magazine. It would also help if we actually cared about our soldiers and only send them into harms way when meaningful and help them when they get back.
4681 2018-11-09 00:14:01 The NRA is so absolutist on guns that  ANY  politician who takes money from an organization that thinks assault rifles and bump stocks are fine — well, that politician is reprehensible. That means gutless Rob Portman, lapdog.

4686 2018-11-09 00:11:00 Also, I DON'T want guns banned. I want stricter background checks, no guns for ppl w/ 2+ DV arrests or 1 felony DV conviction or ppl who've been flagged by mental health pro. If you can pass those quals, feel free to "stay strapped." I DO want bump stocks & high cap mags banned.

4688 2018-11-09 00:08:50 Background checks, manditory extensive gun safety courses, manditory week long wait/hold time. Make hand guns restricted and make people "jump through hoops" to even be able to obtain them, no open/concealed carry to anyone, limit magazine sizes, no bump stocks- there's a start

4) they already aren't supposed to, but shit happens
