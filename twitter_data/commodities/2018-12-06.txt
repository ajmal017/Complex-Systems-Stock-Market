1 2018-12-06 23:39:11 The market interactions between commodities both fascinate and befuddle me. It’s what makes Ag I like any other market. It’s beautiful.
2 2018-12-06 23:38:21 PBOC said 3.5 yrs ago “internationalizing CNY” is about invoicing energy imports in CNY & therefore Chinese sovereign control of China’s current account.

China’s non-commodity goods trade surplus is $700B.  If they can print CNY for commodities, China can’t have a BoP crisis.
3 2018-12-06 23:25:35 Yes, they just call them commodities, commodities, commodities and commodities.
4 2018-12-06 23:17:23 The most precious of all freedoms are speech and ideas. They are the most precious commodities in the marketplace of progress and liberty. It's not up to some who have set themselves up elitist idealists to stomp on the freedom of expressions of others. This is pure dictatorship.

8 2018-12-06 22:41:22 Right, well if I can wade through your awful English, then you appear to argue that global commodities will be cheaper due to the abolishing of a time zone? I fear Google translate has failed you, comrade
9 2018-12-06 22:41:11 Opinions are the cheapest commodities on earth. Everyone has a flock of opinions ready to be wished upon anyone who will accept them. If you are influenced by "opinions" when you reach DECISIONS, you will not succeed in any undertaking.
10 2018-12-06 22:36:21 Today a group of 21 value chain actors and 14 chefs visited 7 farms to discuss tomorrow opportunities to scale up #agritourism policy in  #Seychelles Tomorrow discussion to focus on quality of locally produced farm commodities to benefit #producers and #hotels @Chefs4Dev
11 2018-12-06 22:19:11 Beats are like commodities, when you dont have any you miss them
12 2018-12-06 22:15:23 Shock horror. I love Europe. I have many friends all across the continent. Great people, scenery, commodities. 

I also love cheese. That doesn’t mean I want to be joined to one dairy for the rest of my life.
13 2018-12-06 22:10:36 I don’t have superior knowledge. Oil is priced similar to other commodities like aluminum, lithium and iron. Buyers and sellers agree to buy at a price.  It changes based on a lot of factors but expected demand and expected supply are key factors.
14 2018-12-06 22:01:47 You must be as brainless and poor student of history like president @MBuhari and the @OfficialAPCNg .. Kindly answer your foolish questions with the current stock market or cost of commodities and exchange rate.. Nigeria is now the capital Poor people

Climate change could affect our ability to procure needed commodities....Climate change may be associated with extreme weather conditions, such as more intense hurricanes, thunderstorms, tornadoes, and snow or ice storms, as well as rising sea levels.
16 2018-12-06 21:41:17 Não, foi condenado por aproveitar os bons ventos das commodities e desviar bilhões para financiar o projeto que teve como objetivo perpetuar o PT no poder, achando que o Brasil pertence a esse partido...Só não contava que o dinheiro levantado corromperia até os seus.
17 2018-12-06 21:35:30 men angry about being painted as the “villains” in society like they haven’t oppressed and used women as commodities for the last 2000 years at LEAST lmaoooooooooooooo
18 2018-12-06 21:30:34 Don't just save di ting, find a rate sensitive value store. Commodities or fmcg smart zhet.
