73 2018-06-19 19:07:41 I think you are here spot on.

There is no "real" intrinsic value in commodities.

The value is simply what buyer is willing to pay.
74 2018-06-19 19:01:37 These commodities focus on more packaging above quality.

120 2018-06-19 16:37:26 Open source projects will one day turn today’s proprietary data flows into commodities.

This is a larger threat to the internet titans than regulation or sentiment.

Check back in 10 years.
121 2018-06-19 16:36:38 As I watch the Gold and Silver Commodities Market fall, I worry about my holdings but then take delight in knowing that each and every one of .@realDonaldTrump's toilets just went down in value!
122 2018-06-19 16:36:10 perhaps and debatable depending if you think that they are subsututable commodities.  you will note i intentionally referenced bitcoin to gold as a sore of value as opporsed to the precious metals sector as a whole.
123 2018-06-19 16:32:35 Not at all comparable to what Egypt faced. Also the continued 'defending' of the naira has also helped ease inflation, esp for key commodities

125 2018-06-19 16:29:36 Sí usted cree que los políticos hacen lo suficiente por  la economía del país y que la misma depende de ellos, les tengo malas noticias, dependemos de los "commodities" y la OPEP está dando señales de fracturas internas y presiones externas de Rusia para aumentar la producción.
126 2018-06-19 16:26:28 In terms of the green economy, Glencore is also strongly positioned to supply the increasing demand of commodities like Copper, Nickel, and Cobalt, used in green technologies like EV batteries 2/
127 2018-06-19 16:26:01 We can and do have the right to remove our government. How? Easy.. do not use money or any precious commodities for currency as well as digital. And do not pay your bills do not buy.  Trade and they will fall and we will have control again. it won't happen your all misdirected
128 2018-06-19 16:23:41 Certainly, but elasticity in this climate is something my children will learn about in economics. Yes, times have changed, but it wasn't too long ago commodities wouldn't change $.25 in a year. 

I guess I should feel at home though. I grew up raising cattle :)
129 2018-06-19 16:22:52 Today on AgriTalk After the Bell, @ChipFlory talks with guest analyst Don Roose @US_Commodities, perspective on price action from Joe Vaclavik @StandardGrain and news with @DavisMichaelsen. Live at 2:06CT! #ChipATB
130 2018-06-19 16:19:26 Also looks like a real panic capitulation in soft commodities this morning... impressive possible hammer bottoms in corn, wheat, & soybeans
131 2018-06-19 16:17:22 My interpretation of today:

I’ll hold my own damn beer. Y’all just watch this.
- Commodities
132 2018-06-19 16:11:39 Nailing it today as usual, Munch! Are you still in on your long Gold trade? I am but the new low today has had me a little concerned. I know you don't pay much attention to correlations but it always freaks me out a bit when I see SPX and commodities synchronising every move!
133 2018-06-19 16:09:44 DEE'ISM: "There are certain givens among the phantasmagoria of commodities on a landfill. On nearly every outing there, I either stepped on a dildo, tripped on some grey cabling, was detained by the pleading button-eyes of a dead soft-toy, or kicked a book by Ranulph Fiennes."
134 2018-06-19 16:09:10 RT blisstrades "RT EconguyRosie: Keep an eye on the USD. It's breaking out. Big negative for global liquidity, EM, US industrials and commodities. Somewhat reminiscent of early 2016, but the trade tensions are a new negative twist. LllTake risk off the table."
135 2018-06-19 16:02:47 Amen to this! Great partnerships are precious commodities.

138 2018-06-19 15:53:10 I think Trump Penzeys are looking at the Old Testament and the crazy old religionists who were willing to perform genocide slaughter their undesirable tribal members use women as commodities,playtoys concubines, beating cushions!
Jesus came from that.
139 2018-06-19 15:50:04 The same way they used to regard Black Americans not as neighbors, but as commodities.

141 2018-06-19 15:46:33 When I look at my portfolio,  I see #Silver and #Copper #miners taking a bit of a beating today,  but #Gold is hanging strong. #Commodities continue to come under pressure,  but gold is #money and different from the rest.
142 2018-06-19 15:45:18 Tweets like this is what makes men view women as commodities, equating yourselves with cars? Wtf!
143 2018-06-19 15:43:07 I like all commodities.
144 2018-06-19 15:38:56 A menor tasa, se busca mas retorno y los commodities reciben flujos. A mayor tasa, las carteras se arman con más ". Pero creo que se explica más por tensión USA-China
145 2018-06-19 15:29:56 acceptable justification? like...free market capitalism? or terra nullius? or manifest destiny? or free trade agreements? or foreign oil and other commodities? or imperial interests abroad? or capitalist interests at home?
146 2018-06-19 15:25:28 Ladies pls don't set price tags on yourself so that  men can buy you, making it looks as if you are some sort of commodities, why not try to be independent?
147 2018-06-19 15:25:27 No change at all after 7 months in power. Inflation on the rise, cash shortages threatening, prices of fuel and basic commodities increasing.
148 2018-06-19 15:24:17 #China gov wants higher soybean prices: After it told Chinese farmers to grow more soybeans (so it c/screw US farmers), China farmers refused b/c get more $ for corn.

If we want fair trade/mfg jobs/China not collapsing US commodities as did Brazil’s,we s/support Trump.
149 2018-06-19 15:16:32 WOMEN ARE NOT COMMODITIES. So probably...Animal ka. 
150 2018-06-19 15:13:15 MARKETS ROIL UNDER THREAT OF TRADE WAR; hardest hit exchanges include those in Asia – Shanghai Composite down 3.80%. President Trump is threatening to levy a 10% tariff on $200B worth of goods coming from the country. Commodities down across the board.
151 2018-06-19 15:11:30 RT DanaSchwartzzz: Some of the worst men I’ve ever encountered are nerds who didn’t get girls when they were younger, then became successful and now see them as commodities they’re entitled to
152 2018-06-19 15:10:28 Damn this economy has affected soo  many commodities, a plane with only 10 passengers on board..smh
153 2018-06-19 15:10:21 Commodities Trader. Wrong again
154 2018-06-19 15:08:11 “Peace of mind and a clear conscience are precious commodities.”
155 2018-06-19 15:00:45 IMO POTUS Trump discussed more than denuclearization with North Korea; as in becoming a trading partner, especially for US agricultural commodities (grains, pork etc). Lifting of sanctions will be gradual & not occur overnight. @POTUS is too smart not have an ace up his sleeve.
156 2018-06-19 15:00:34 That's true too. I really hope that, when more planets get added in, that there are some really significant price differences on commodities between each world.
157 2018-06-19 15:00:10 Just remember..... The hottest commodities in my city, still need permission slips and fake ids 
158 2018-06-19 14:58:47 What @Spicxer said. These drivers use to develop on the short tracks and were known commodities. Now it is a bunch of rich kids with rides and fans can’t indentify with them.
159 2018-06-19 14:53:18 AÇÚCAR: Nova York cai mais de 2% seguindo outras commodities
160 2018-06-19 14:50:09 Total opposite. Inflationary pressures going away from rising commodities extended the bull market huge!  Yield curve inversion delayed now
161 2018-06-19 14:49:04 Which makes me want to not pull the buy trigger across most commodities unless there’s a wipeout like with soybeans an hour ago
162 2018-06-19 14:44:42 Only a few people DIED in Puerto Rico according to him...people are just commodities to him
163 2018-06-19 14:37:01 You're just waking up from slumber indeed! U behave as if you like poverty! What is ur gain in a govt that believes in increasing all prices of commodities in order to oppress us? In AAU in Edo state, tuition fees was b/w 10k-15k but 2day, it's over 160k, then what is ur problem?
164 2018-06-19 14:33:09 For some perspective ......look at Corn one of the more fundamentally bullish commodities IMO, it is nearly 10% below its 200 DMA at 3.97....... Dec. Cotton 200 DMA is 75.54 plenty of room to go down if the funds panic....money flow is powerful
165 2018-06-19 14:32:37 @WilsonCenterMEP Discussion on #Yemen @peterjsalisbury "not so much that things (commodities, food) aren't getting in at all but that things are too expensive for most Yemenis - people just can't afford to buy things, the economy is not there"
166 2018-06-19 14:32:00 Everything is down today, across the board... markets in US, Europe, Asia, as well as commodities.... and bonds are flat.. $SPX $DJI #DAX #IBEX
167 2018-06-19 14:29:03 Por que raios todo mundo tá falando em subir juros? Crescimento decepcionou e inflação está controlada. Politica monetária tem meta inflação, não meta cambio. Antes de gerar inflação, cambio pra cima vai trazer competitividade para a industria e para commodities.

172 2018-06-19 14:14:24 So how low do commodities have to go before we can quit hearing the feed x number of people by 2050 sales pitch?  Cause I’m all for that $

174 2018-06-19 14:12:14 Equities and Commodities .. you know the actual stock markets.
175 2018-06-19 14:09:38 Seems people are gaming everything these days. Welfare is my biggest pet peeve. Those folks should be drug tested and made to do something good for their community. Got a female with 5 kids getting food & commodities. While her man is bringing in a big fat paycheck.
176 2018-06-19 14:06:05 A Bancada Ruralista não é formada por produtores agrícolas. É uma bancada de donos de terra e parlamentares a serviço da indústria química e das empresas de comercialização de commodities. #ChegaDeAgrotoxico #Resista

180 2018-06-19 13:58:42 And also watch for ivory-replacement commodities, such as the growing demand for Asian elephant skin poached from Myanmar. @elephantfamily
181 2018-06-19 13:56:10 Yeah sugar is low-key one of the most important commodities in the history of human civ, especially in the 'rise of modernity' as it's called. Sweetness and Power by Sidney Mintz would reorient your whole perspective of the world. Recent editions are...slightly less mind-numbing
182 2018-06-19 13:44:56 And cancel the "free trade" agreements that savaged our manufacturing sector and their agricultural sectors. Subsidized Monsanto junk food commodities forced hundreds of thousands of farmers off their lands. Many head to US borders.
183 2018-06-19 13:43:27 It goes without saying that the story is long gone & forgotten. They have moved on to fake lifestyle audits & seizures of substandard commodities. These stories are also about to  be forgotten shortly!
184 2018-06-19 13:42:46 Es imposible competir con nuestros commodities contra un pais que le da valor agregado a todo por eso valemos belga.
185 2018-06-19 13:29:15 Os únicos beneficiados com a tensão entre China e EUA são justamente China e EUA maiores consumidores de commodities reduzindo o preço além do fortalecimento do dólar.
186 2018-06-19 13:26:07 EUA e China são os maiores consumidores de commodities até agora esse teatro deles só derrubou o preço das commodities, soja e ferro, principalmente. Petróleo esta com sua previsão de consumo subindo, ou seja tem alguma coisa que não contaram pra gente ainda.
187 2018-06-19 13:23:43 No ve gente, solo commodities

189 2018-06-19 13:20:58 I didn't know you followed commodities of the Chicago Board of Trade. Their building is only a few blocks from my office.
190 2018-06-19 13:18:42 We're looking forward to sharing a few insights from our webinar conversation today with @un_BLOC and @2020MarEnergy on how #digitalisation #blockchain and new #email tech can create new commercial efficiencies in the #shipping and commodities sector.
191 2018-06-19 13:18:33 More like all the grain commodities.
192 2018-06-19 13:16:29 Not me. I think this whole trade war tariffs thing is stupid. The bottom line that I don’t get on why commodities shift price on tariffs. There is a set amount of commodity out there. There is a set amount of global consumption.
193 2018-06-19 13:15:31 Children are not commodities.

196 2018-06-19 13:09:41 Ya i am still majority overweight long financials and tech and commodities. But Dow is going for 6 straight down. Hasn't had a real big rally in a while. Sometimes in these types of days the algos don't care if er are great and they still slam the stock only to bid it up later...
197 2018-06-19 13:09:21 It's the idea that children are commodities, and need to be taught that is their only worth.
198 2018-06-19 13:07:59 Um professor afirmando que Lula criou 18 Universidades? Que tirou milhões da pobreza? O Sr como professor conhece a alta das Commodities que levou pobres a emergentes, é recente isso, vivi isso e o Sr tbm. E sabe tbm que ele só trocou nomes das Universidades.
199 2018-06-19 13:07:46 As an spot exchange u are responsible for trade settlement, u r responsible for safeguarding of underlying commodities & questioning about ur responsibility is not targeting.
How can u even ask such questions?
200 2018-06-19 13:06:46 This is the norm, a child unconditionally loves their parents & vice versa. Everyone has been a child and has an idea what it’s like to be separated from their parents.  Trump hasn’t got those feelings - his upbringing was void of love and he sees his own children as commodities.
201 2018-06-19 13:05:06 We are all Commodities to be bought and sold just like cattle. They think they are gods #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder #Killary
202 2018-06-19 13:04:00 Here is an argument that $BTC is totally undervalued. First, price for commodities are driven by supply, demand, storage costs, & interest rates. Not just current but future. Rates are low. Storage costs are zero. Supply is known. It’s a demand game, a future demand one (1/N)
203 2018-06-19 12:49:50 Disputa comercial EE.UU.-China continúa escalando, y castigo a commodities se intensifica. Mala noticia para Chile, y la velocidad de recuperación. Aún mayor necesidad por redoblar esfuerzos para estimular inversión local
204 2018-06-19 12:38:51 This isn’t just about Republicans & Democrats.  Everything that is happening right now with the migrant children is the prez’s way of TRYING to manipulate America into paying for his precious wall.. He is using those poor kids as commodities..SMH..
205 2018-06-19 12:36:07 O que sobe é o valor das commodities em Dalian e o prêmio no Brasil sobre a soja negociada na CBOT de Chicago. Mas commodities em CBOT devem cair pois o produtor americano não tem a quem vender. Em relação ao $IBOV, o risco é de mercado e não de uma ou outra ação específica=Short
206 2018-06-19 12:34:03 Keep an eye on the USD. It's breaking out. Big negative for global liquidity, EM, US industrials and commodities. Somewhat reminiscent of early 2016, but the trade tensions are a new negative twist. LllTake risk off the table.
207 2018-06-19 12:32:54 Bruh. These trade wahala with Trump is stressing mans. The prices of many commodities and metals are falling. Lol
208 2018-06-19 12:32:31 Short? Com commodities agricolas subindo o Short é em BRFS3 na cabeça. Ou frango não come?
209 2018-06-19 12:31:48 Only commodities that should crash are ones USA can restrict,like corn. We dont even produce silver. And,gold isnt on tariff list $GLD $SLV

Maybe you’re not capable of that. What I’m saying nonetheless is “May he who is without sin, cast...” #Commodities
214 2018-06-19 12:04:33 I thought "the" tariffs were supposed to be inflationary? Commodities in freefall..
215 2018-06-19 12:03:49 @TeamUpTea @RachelWilshaw @oxfamcampaigns Oxfam has found that average earnings in a number of commodities are not adequate to meet the needs of workers and their families and uphold their rights.
216 2018-06-19 11:43:14 "DOW down 376 & NASDAQ 101. Stay short the stock indexes as charts & trade War worsens. Corn down 8 & Soybeans down 24-stay short and hedged with the trailing buy stops posted. Waiting on Coffee. #Agriculture #Commodities #Grains #Soybeans #Corn
217 2018-06-19 11:39:20 Trading commodities during a trade war is a bit like becoming a professional ferret legger.

219 2018-06-19 11:26:26 Every time I speak on healthcare (frequently) I say that the very first thing we need to change is the thinking that healthcare is anything other than a set of services and commodities governed by the same economic laws as car mechanics.
220 2018-06-19 11:15:08 Não é a Historia que conta, a alta das Commodities que levou pobre a emergentes e a nível MUNDIAL,  acabamos de VIVENCIAR, vivemos isso. O Sr como professor como tem coragem de mentir dessa forma? Fomos os penultimos em crescimento, ficando a frente apenas do México.
221 2018-06-19 11:14:52 Man there are a lot of "red" commodities this morning! #OOTT
222 2018-06-19 11:02:30 War is the systematic murder of the poor who are treated like disposable commodities by the ruling elites.
223 2018-06-19 11:01:52 Sobre Lula ter tirado tanta gente da pobreza extrema. MENTIRA. O Sr já ouviu já ouviu falar na alta das Commodities prof? Esqueceu acontecimento mundial tão recente? Informe-se professor, mundo real agradece. Ah e nem toda brasileira é bunda, já dizia Rita Lee.
224 2018-06-19 10:54:21 Hello sa mga susunod na papasok sa workforce. The value of peso is degrading. The tax we'll pay are high. The job security and tenure is always in question. The prices of commodities are high. The economy is slowly down turning. How to compete in a society were nobody has power?
225 2018-06-19 10:51:35 EVERYTHING that is occurring right now is beyond wrong..People are being treated like commodities instead of human beings. This prez will continue to do this until he gets his way..
226 2018-06-19 10:50:13 AHCX Commodities Price Update 16 - 22 June 2018
227 2018-06-19 10:45:15 It's a strategic alliance,China buys weapons from Russia,Russia buys commodities from China, all done via currency swap bypassing the dollar. US, UK,France and Germany watch in complete dismay,so they just play the human rights card.
228 2018-06-19 10:42:15 Que interpretação mais superficial!

Existe sim, a politica cambial, mas a contrapartida dela vem da da reforma tributária, principalmente da desoneração do consumo.
A política industrial é justamente para não dependermos de commodities.

É muito pedantismo...
229 2018-06-19 10:41:05 J&k,rising price of  commodities,not bringing price of petrol and diesel under GST,dissatisfaction among allies are the main hurdles of BJP.
230 2018-06-19 10:34:24 Other than imposing further taxes on basic commodities,the government can explore innovative ways of raising revenue to fund projects and programs that would improve food security whilst cushioning low-income households against the brunt of increase in prices of basic commodities
231 2018-06-19 10:30:30 Energy market needs to be REGULATED immediately. 
Why do we allow parasitic energy companies to "steal" BASIC necessary commodities from the population to create huge wealth for their owners? 
This is just another version of Russian oligarchs.

235 2018-06-19 10:18:13 Le commodities si pagano in dollari o in euro le ns imprese pagheranno di più le materie prime. Questo ragionamento valeva negli anni 60 dove i consumi energetici erano molto più bassi ed avevamo una maggiore autoproduzione energetica grazie ad inceneritori e centrali nucleari.
236 2018-06-19 10:17:33 Good choice - it also illustrates a mindset - the food pictured is way too expensive to give to just anyone.  Uncooked basic food what used to be called commodities was given, But back then people that got the food tried hard to work to keep from  having to go pick up a handout.
237 2018-06-19 10:02:03 Libya has lost 400k b/d of output after recent attacks on oil terminals: NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla told @business reporters in Vienna.. Workers are still trying to stabilize the situation #OOTT #commodities
238 2018-06-19 09:54:40 I hope it will be applied equally across the economic universe. There are other formal/informal cartels in commodities (West African cocoa, e.g.) & throughout the economic system, artificially affecting prices.

241 2018-06-19 09:43:29 Good find! This is exactly what a Trade War is. Sounds pretty scary but, like military wars, if one country makes a move then another country retaliates. The next question is... is China a large importer/buyer of US commodities?

243 2018-06-19 09:32:53 Why do we pay for taxes? Politicians want retailers to test for mercury at their own cost. They are creating jobs for themselves because we know their companies will be testing these commodities

294 2018-06-19 04:52:18 Absolutely true
Farmers are frustrated in a well orchestrated move to make them give up in the productions. Then all of a sudden we start hearing they have resorted to import commodities outside. This scheme should stop
#AMLiveNTV
295 2018-06-19 04:32:00 Bravo! However, we need to as a country come up with processing hubs that ensure value-addition to commodities being exported/products consumed locally. It will have a positive effect on the economy: more profit,more foreign exchange earnings,job creation,wastage elimination etc
296 2018-06-19 04:24:08 30% is the OECD '14 number by the way.

and China does care about the CNY price of oil -- and maybe a few other commodities. 

but not in my experience about the price of imported manufactures (which are a very small share of Chinese consumption)
297 2018-06-19 04:13:10 Even the most overtly political works of art can simultaneously, as commodities, participate in the reproduction of the structural inequities they profess to condemn. The author is a producer.

306 2018-06-19 03:24:37 @MebFaber re-reading your paper on asset class mean reversion after multiple down years - does the theory hold for agricultural commodities? E.g. Corn, wheat, sugar, soybeans - 'rubber band' very stretched for that basket

The CME has rigged commodities markets for years.

A few large players swing the market for say cocount oil, affecting millions of poor farmer's around the world that do not get a fair deal on their product, so they can make fat margins.

Why we need CME?
