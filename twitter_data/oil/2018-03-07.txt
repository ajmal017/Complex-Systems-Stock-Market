40 2018-03-07 23:57:34 I love the environment but to be practical politicians and so called environmentalists who want to shut down the oil industry but travel all over the world in jets-"Hypocrites" Lets be practical.

42 2018-03-07 23:57:33 Oh my gosh  Wow. K thinks maybe I should take my pill with the coconut oil! How did those pups I corporate the oil into their diet?
43 2018-03-07 23:57:27 To be fair, i think the biggest mistake is actually letting him go down ramp without notice. If Flusha went behind oil having 4:3 wouldnt matter anyways. But the few seconds Olof’s back was turned cost them the round
44 2018-03-07 23:57:26 The solution to all these problems is "roast them with a shitload of garlic and olive oil."
45 2018-03-07 23:57:26 And turn the oil off because they get oil from Alberta too.

51 2018-03-07 23:56:40 I gotta learn how to do an oil change at some point 
52 2018-03-07 23:56:38 go to fountain to get my oil changed & I end up being the main gossip.. ppl seriously need to grow up
53 2018-03-07 23:56:30 Justin Trudeau I believe that Canada should put tariffs on imports from the states. Increase charge on things Such as hydro,wood, gold oil. Increase tariffs of Autos Ford GM & Chrysler. Disband the Trade Agreement. Time to think about Canada. It's the way of Trump & others.

They want to take PREPA out of public hands & put it into private hands regardless of the %age generated by PREPA. 2nd: Raw materials don't change unless type of generation changes. Oil generated facilities still need oil & that's majority.

There were also school shooting during his presidency 
but The DNC still takes $ from weapons manufacturers.
120 2018-03-07 23:43:57 “underneath the hair are nerve endings, blood vessels, oil glands. The hair fiber effects what's going on underneath." When that structure gets pulled in a direction it's not used to for a long period of time, it almost gets stuck. Specifically for long, thick hair.

They are greenwashed except BC didn't bite. @jjhorgan I guess this means more money wasted in court to get the NDP off the hook (defending BC) and more time wasted. Politics is such a waste of time.

144 2018-03-07 23:40:17 油揚げって言うほど油って感じしなくない？ほんとに騙された気分だよ。
145 2018-03-07 23:40:10 In 1967 and 1973 the Arab Oil Coalition turned off their oil exports in an attempt to prevent countries from supporting Israel in the War's the Arabs started. The U.S. now has 1 steel and 1 aluminum plant despite having hundreds decades ago. What will happen if those imports stop
146 2018-03-07 23:39:27 Yeah I can't see that either, but you're probably right about the oil boom!
147 2018-03-07 23:39:17 6And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine.
148 2018-03-07 23:39:16 Why are oil tankers banned on the west coast but not the east coast?
149 2018-03-07 23:39:15 & that box be slippery like tryna walk on oil
150 2018-03-07 23:39:00 We've got Oil King vouchers available for $22 per ticket! Stop by the SAM Centre to pick up your tickets.
151 2018-03-07 23:38:53 @MaryamHenein Explains to @JuneStoyer Why She Is Turning To #CBD Oil For #Lupus & #Fibromyalgia via @TheOrganicView
152 2018-03-07 23:38:36 Ginger essential oil has so many amazing uses! It has a range of therapeutic properties: analgesic, antiseptic, stimulant. It is warming physically & emotionally, super for SAD. Great post-workout to relax sore muscles & in cold weather to get circulation back into hands & feet.
153 2018-03-07 23:38:35 Funny how all the Dems are board for Infrastructure improvements,  which like always will be temporary and just to put them I the good graces with the voters.  Perhaps it should have been funded all along!  Do you change the oil in your car just once in a while or on a schedule?
154 2018-03-07 23:38:31 Probably believes in abiotic oil as well.
155 2018-03-07 23:38:28 I WANT MY OIL BACK NOW 

WHAT
156 2018-03-07 23:38:26 Just have to say this why do certain girls use oil when you shower? I nearly slipped and fell almost breaking my back.

Just why?
157 2018-03-07 23:38:12 I'm obsessed with lavender oil 
158 2018-03-07 23:38:12 So who do the British govt.convict
for the continued GENOCIDE of Biafra Jews and Christians in West Africa for oil?
159 2018-03-07 23:38:10 The same Secretary of State that has ties to big oil and Putin? Who has no staff? Who refuses to talk to the press? **That** Secretary?
160 2018-03-07 23:38:00 Rub olive oil on it.
161 2018-03-07 23:37:57 @vjdevi お誕生日おめでとうございます！！これからも現場でお世話になります。幸多き一年になりますよう。
162 2018-03-07 23:37:47 Like regulations that have led to over a dozen deaths in the oil industry? Ones that now allow extra chemical dumping in our rivers and oceans? Ones that allow elephants to be killed and brought back to the US? 
163 2018-03-07 23:37:40 Healing oil
Nanay: pwede yan sa sugat. Kahit sariwa pa 
Me: sa puso nay pwede yan?. Sariwa pa kasi e ()
164 2018-03-07 23:37:23 Which makes sense for New Zealand, tough for us to swallow due to the fact we are a major oil producing country
165 2018-03-07 23:37:05 There's absolutely no compelling science that shows consumption of coconut oil ALONE causes CVD.
166 2018-03-07 23:37:01 Shipping and supply chain management might be changing. The 3-D printing technology is interesting and AI will change the requirements for the oil industry. I'm curious when the disruption will completely upend the AB economy. It's still a bit hazy. Eventually we won't use oil.
167 2018-03-07 23:36:28 Hey Mike. MAGA is great until off shore oil drilling destroys all these beautiful beaches, except for Florida of course (because entitled Trump doesn’t want oil washed up at Mar-a-lago). You have a nerve posting this pic.
168 2018-03-07 23:36:26 I don't accept defeat on Brexit. It's stupid and extremely damaging. Voted on by 33 million people, of whom less than 1% really understood the issues and implications. People voted with their gut feeling based on simplistic slogans sold by snake oil salesmen.
169 2018-03-07 23:36:14 Huh. Well, Im a night person too and I was born at 3 am. Interesting..  Had never heard this. Oil have to research further!
170 2018-03-07 23:36:12 インターネットおじさんは引き出しが豊富なのだ！！
171 2018-03-07 23:36:01 Lol thank you! I’ve tried argan oil and that doesn’t work. My daughters hair is kinky kinky she needs stuff that’s gonna keep her hair moisturized
172 2018-03-07 23:35:27 Living my best life with my Dulce de Leche icecream, coconut oil in my hair, and Vitamin E oil on my skin. 
173 2018-03-07 23:35:14 As a CT resident please post location of said new country, along with recommendations of ways to travel to said new country. Remember Malloy has always been this bad, he's just now getting national attention. He was also reelected. 

Divorce. Now.
174 2018-03-07 23:35:11 Getting rid of Gaelic road signs will make Scotland absolutely minted. If will solve our problems. It will be like discovering oil all over again & we all know how that went. How thick are these Yoons ffs?
175 2018-03-07 23:35:01 I’ll definitely try coconut oil.
176 2018-03-07 23:34:51 Daily or as-needed cleaning of your countertops will reduce dirt, oil penetration and water spotting.
177 2018-03-07 23:34:44 The Artwork is Oil Pastel titled 'Step Out of the Shadows
178 2018-03-07 23:34:35 Is there an essential oil that smells like pizza? Because the smell of pizza makes everyone feel better.
179 2018-03-07 23:34:24 Kemi oil smells different now, it smells like pineapples lol
180 2018-03-07 23:34:21 Sorry for your loss. I hope you were able to get that cannabis oil for him so he could ride the “high” way to pup heaven!
181 2018-03-07 23:34:16 Add chili oil
182 2018-03-07 23:33:51 Corporate democrats aren't exactly leading the charge on climate change either, they just aren't as overtly or so generally indebt to oil money as to actively deny it. Why? I can't point to one thing exclusively to be honest.
183 2018-03-07 23:33:48 at a low cost of only ONE date , you can get that oil change . 
184 2018-03-07 23:33:45 Guess he figured it was time to suck up to the oil industry lawyers who back Scott Pruitt's destruction of National Parks. Feel good moments
185 2018-03-07 23:33:39 the song coconut oil makes me teary-eyed
186 2018-03-07 23:33:36 Found a lot of vintage leather lately. Love to recycle. #steeltownofsweden #leathercraft #handmadeleather #organicskincare New beard oil coming soon aswell!
187 2018-03-07 23:33:17 LOL- I'm glad you think that way!- you won't miss the money when it's gone then.  The U.S. will appreciate your gift- we're going oil and coal in a big way- like china, The Middle East and the rest of the industrialized world.
188 2018-03-07 23:33:17 Try some motor oil
189 2018-03-07 23:32:53 No spills don't go on everyday involving oil in BC waters.
Btw...Canada does not have tar sands.
190 2018-03-07 23:32:51 Well Lol when my baby didn’t have hair i used “baby don’t be bald” & “three flowers”& his hair did grow . Argan oil is good. Just try stuff
191 2018-03-07 23:32:51 My bio oil routine is so important in my life, blessed that my cystic acne has not returned since I finished roaccutane but man the scars are just as confidence destroying as the acne was
192 2018-03-07 23:32:45 เขาเรียกว่าสายไปกว่าจะรู้ใจ
193 2018-03-07 23:32:41 Although I won’t listen to her music, I am willing to apply oil vigorously to Demi Lovato’s buttcheeks
194 2018-03-07 23:32:30 Don't forget oil and gas. Hilly wanted to kill our energy industry. Trump said drill baby drill. The only export the Ruskies have is energy. Cheap US gas and oil is not good for Putin or Russia.
195 2018-03-07 23:32:24 Ha Ha, Man I hope so. Yes I would like to spray some oil on the roads ! Can I ?  It would be fun ! 
196 2018-03-07 23:32:22 CBD oil without THC is harmless, and is very good for many people. Wish lawmakers would pass a bill to allow the sale of pure CBD in Utah.
197 2018-03-07 23:32:07 If the situation in Ontario is any indication the costs to families are going to be progressively increasing. The rush to greenwash the oil industry has costs for all citizens. Curious what Kenney will do. Bring back coal fired plants?  End C tax? Nah. He's stuck. He's blame NDP.
198 2018-03-07 23:32:02 There is at least one study that shows free eating people eat more when the chips are fried in veg oil then beat fat.  Yet the latter tastes better to me!
199 2018-03-07 23:32:01 At the end of the day, it's LV*CPM. I went to law school do I know no more math than that. But, lots of people will sell you snake oil.
200 2018-03-07 23:31:59 Why is there a creepy lit oil lantern out on your snowy lawn?  DO you live in a haunted house?
201 2018-03-07 23:31:58 no los llamen YRG, es restrictivo innecesariamente. Donde quedan tight oil tight gas?
202 2018-03-07 23:31:54 Look how these platforms have become high tech. Think of the investment and how many there are pumping and looking for oil. Glad they are on our side!!
203 2018-03-07 23:31:44 Those who think that the globalist approach and oppose @realDonaldTrump Tariffs are idiots. They should reexamine the two oil embargoes to see what can happen if the United States allow's Critical American companies to die out.
204 2018-03-07 23:31:32 女性がたくさんいる職場だから、返す負担が多くて困ってます……。
205 2018-03-07 23:31:22 1 shot of olive oil a day ?
206 2018-03-07 23:31:19 
We cold-press Red raspberry seed oil from seed to oil here in the PNW =]
207 2018-03-07 23:31:01 My dealership is offering 25 oil changes so it's lit
208 2018-03-07 23:30:50 ありがとうございます！だんだんめでたくない年齢になってきますね。
209 2018-03-07 23:30:44 The next time I'm depressed and want to sad eat, someone please remind me that I want to eat an entire baguette with olive oil.
210 2018-03-07 23:30:40 i need some tea tree oil ): who got me? 
211 2018-03-07 23:30:25 Sleep better! Put a bit of lavender oil on your pillow. Studies show that the essential oil can improve your sleep quality.
212 2018-03-07 23:30:21 OIL DIFF: 3.33 -> 3.4
213 2018-03-07 23:30:19 Coconut Oil, Olive Oil, Peppermint Oil, Lavender Oil, and Coconut Oil 
214 2018-03-07 23:30:17 Why ~else~ Organic?

Our new Organic solution has THESE scrumptious ingredients... Aloe, Green Tea Extract, Hemp Seed Oil, and Caramel. These ingredients are rich in vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and all help your skin to be even and healthy.
215 2018-03-07 23:30:09 And oil change*** don’t forget that
216 2018-03-07 23:29:53 We need clean energy solutions. Oil is so last century.
217 2018-03-07 23:29:50 Timothy you don’t understand the global outlook for oil. If we can’t get our oil to market someone else will fill that demand. I do believe that the world would rather do business with Canada rather than other countries, but global consumers won’t wait around for Canada
218 2018-03-07 23:29:42 Pelosi has widely supported conservation programs and energy research appropriations. She has also voted to remove an amendment that would allow for oil and gas exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.[106]
219 2018-03-07 23:29:37 High prices lead to their own mitigation: more domestic production. We saw it w/ 08 oil spike. We could continue to lower domestic taxes as well. All leads to increase in investment here vs abroad
220 2018-03-07 23:29:15 Oil parasite eh? Well, when Alberta shuts off the tap.... you guys down south will be screwed. Lol.
221 2018-03-07 23:29:15 40% of palm oil and 14% of the meat produced worldwide are the result of deforestation ! Think about what you eat !
222 2018-03-07 23:29:14 Mans got oil money though?
223 2018-03-07 23:29:09 I guess you're not supposed to tell your coworkers that you want to rub coconut oil all over their beautiful bodies? I don't care, Dan looks hot since he's been working out.
224 2018-03-07 23:29:09 Also need to order myself some cold pressed jojoba oil
225 2018-03-07 23:29:08 No oil. You can add a little sugar. High gluten.
226 2018-03-07 23:29:06 Shame !! No one should oil to Fire
227 2018-03-07 23:29:03 @TYTLive FYI Ted's dad brought his family in from Calgary, Alberta. If he only had $100 in his underwear, he must have pissed away all the $$$ he made working in the oil industry.
228 2018-03-07 23:28:40 What are the chances the #ChicagoBlackHawks dump #JoelQuennville at the end of the year? If so, can the #EdmontonOilers swoop in fast enough to snap him up?! #Hawks #Oilers #Oil #McDavid #ConnorMcDavid
229 2018-03-07 23:28:15 They have been tapping its pipelines and refusing to pay for its oil and gas for years. I suppose thieving its assets is the next logical step.
230 2018-03-07 23:28:11 Elevate Massage is WONDERFUL on 14th & Mass, they're really into spiritual natural oil massages. Kaw Valley behind the eldridge is NOICE, they focus on spinal alignment and stretching your muscles. Two different schools of thought, both top notch places!!!
231 2018-03-07 23:28:07 Whats that and why did you give me a evil eye the other day for i was just asking i was gonna charge your oil and see if u wanna jug sometime
232 2018-03-07 23:28:07 Vanessa Bell Armstrong - Oil of God
233 2018-03-07 23:28:06 The Bush Family fortune was made through slave labour and the death of American and allied soldiers playing both sides of the war. American businesses could have stopped the war before it began by not doing business with the Nazis 
Ford, IBM, Standard Oil......
234 2018-03-07 23:28:01 Hey @bariweiss, I'm the Official God-Emperor of Antifa and we're going to blow up all the oil refineries at once tomorrow so that the world returns to the Age of Sail. Pass it on to the @nytimes!
235 2018-03-07 23:28:00 Which policies should I be for? Is it the one where he stopped reimbursing insurance companies, so my payments went up $200 His policy to set up oil drills on our coastlines? His policy to destroy protected lands? His policy to roll back clean water protections? His policy that
236 2018-03-07 23:27:41 @GqGreatness Yeesh! Did you get the oil changed yet?
237 2018-03-07 23:27:39 Florida CNN kids. Looks like doesn't it ??
238 2018-03-07 23:27:37 Just bought these FR’s like two days ago and they already drippin in oil 
239 2018-03-07 23:27:32 So basically I walked around the house butt naked completely forgetting we had visitors, and applied body oil to my hair instead of VCO. Must be bcos I only had 2 hours of sleep and still in pain 
240 2018-03-07 23:27:27 And also, why y'all only bringing up oil money this year when we winning? Last year wasn't nobody talking bout oil money 
241 2018-03-07 23:27:21 Push for releasing the "FREE ENERGY" patents.  The US does NOT need obsolete oil.  The military and the Secret Space Program, both, use free energy.  Why keep the Public using old ways? PUSH FOR IT.
242 2018-03-07 23:27:12 We just got some new *Blueberry 1G - Hood Oil*
243 2018-03-07 23:26:56 “Umm can you ask the chef to sub out the EVOO for some oil that fucks? CocoNUT perhaps?”
244 2018-03-07 23:26:53 BigData is BigCorp. The government parties relies on BogCorp lobby money. Data extraction is high margin - like oil + gas. A noble attempt, but someone got to their pockets before you spoke up. 
We must end corporate lobbying affiliated with donations. Yah, taboo. Hot potato.
245 2018-03-07 23:26:51 "Cadiz, or Gades the Latin name, was an important port in Roman times for the export of olive oil."
Olive oil and the Roman daily sauce: #garum.
246 2018-03-07 23:26:47 Wait..why is oil money a problem ? Sundowns got mining money but don't nobody complain bout that.

If you want a love message to be heard, it has got to be sent out. To keep a lamp burning, we have to keep putting oil in it.
249 2018-03-07 23:26:35 I think they were all blinded by that Rosneft oil money. IMHO Trump promised those minions around him a yuuuge amount of money. And they all kept their mouths shut... for a while.
250 2018-03-07 23:26:35 Oil rig omg we did that like 2 month ago

252 2018-03-07 23:25:53 Also, oil money pays for a lot of material to support this position. 

At that point tribalism can push you over the top
253 2018-03-07 23:25:52 I have. I'm not scared of people trying to help move us towards clean energy and to push back against foreign oil giants. I would like to see more invested in that direction of things actually. The scary thing is giant tax subsidized oil conglomerates manipulating our democracy.

257 2018-03-07 23:25:11 Got my baby an oil change though 
258 2018-03-07 23:24:57 Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone! Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius! Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen! Moloch whose name is the Mind!
259 2018-03-07 23:24:53 Hey CBC, you are the free press - why do you continue to accept the oil cartel lies instead of exposing them for their obvious greed??? (Here is some basic investigative work for you: oil per barrel is still half of what it used to be).
260 2018-03-07 23:24:53 Great. Do they hunt & prepare their own food? Did they build the structures themselves? What about the boats & their engines? Do they drill for the oil & refine it to gasoline to operate those engines? Do they employ a handywoman to fix things? Or are they 'Phony Proud'?
261 2018-03-07 23:24:49 Hey how is Clinton got his car wash and they wanted 2 impeach him bt Trump got an oil change tune up and tires rotated and he not being called to b impeach....really that's how y'all do it.
262 2018-03-07 23:24:33 It's harder to study because it takes a larger group to see differences in outcomes. And if fish oil doesn't help people who are high risk for CV disease, it doesn't seem likely that it will make much difference in the general population, but we just can't say without data!
263 2018-03-07 23:24:33 The gap between your attendance and your capacity? The gap between our fans and yours? The gap between you without your oil money and you now? The gap between our trophies and yours? Will Grigg killed your hopes of a quadruple and the treble
264 2018-03-07 23:24:28 He's a neoliberal sell out who didn't implement his so called "change" but instead made the banks bigger, increased proxy wars in Africa etc, allowed Arctic drilling for big oil companies pretending to care about working people and the environment.His failure led to the far right
265 2018-03-07 23:24:22 I need olive oil injections in my calves
266 2018-03-07 23:24:13 My sister is a saint! She packed me with anti nausea, anti histamines and some peppermint oil for grounding (anxiety coping strategy!). Couldn’t have gotten on this plane without her!
267 2018-03-07 23:24:05 Every waffle recipe on the back of a pancake box calls for vegetable oil. That’s the difference. Waffles are more dense

275 2018-03-07 23:22:28 I wonder, did you manage to sell any snake oil while you were there?
276 2018-03-07 23:22:22 When I bleached my hair, literally messed it up so bad. Got a shoulder length cut(hated it) My hair finally started growing but it was still thin, I stopped any type of heat & put coconut oil on it. Drastic difference. Also had extensions, if they did any damage I couldnt tell.
277 2018-03-07 23:21:51 Hopefully@OceanLeadership is fully aware of how deeply you are connected to Big Oil and how repulsed many Alaskans are your lobbyist directed “leadership” style. We can’t wait to vote you out.
278 2018-03-07 23:21:38 Why do sub Saharan males need to seek asylum ? Nigeria is a secular nation, it has Africa's largest economy, & a large oil industry. Hardly some place to run from. As far as Congo, why don't they immigrate to Nigeria?
279 2018-03-07 23:21:25 Im soo sorry . Wooley have been soo mislead by that Charlatan !! Snake Oil salesman !!!
280 2018-03-07 23:21:24 I am expecting the issue may be the carbs AND a chnage in types of oil, AND additional suger.    Just because we can reverse type2 with low carb, dose not prove it was ONLY the carbs that did it.

283 2018-03-07 23:20:53 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump It's time for US businesses to lower consumer costs as the oil trade war and freedom-killing ObamaCare was their impetus for raising costs of ALL goods and services. @PressSec @FLOTUS @StephenMillerAL

As a curvy girl, I would make skinny girls gain a pound every time they took a selfie with a duck face or said "OMG, I'm so fat!" Eat a sandwich or 7, Olive Oil!
286 2018-03-07 23:20:17 *just smiles as she brings the flour, water, oil, yeast, salt, and sugar together for her dough*

*prepares the oven for 800 degrees too*
287 2018-03-07 23:20:12 Yeah,what do we need it for? As long as we have steel,oil,concrete & coal,we are fine!                                                          Beyond regressively stupid,Munt.
288 2018-03-07 23:20:10 Been getting a lot of compliments on my skin. I drink lots of water. I don't wear makeup during the week. I don't use makeup remover wipes. I use coconut oil instead. I also put aloe vera on my face. Fresh from the plant at night.
289 2018-03-07 23:20:08 Girl wtf like why are you reflecting me right now I went right back to that because coconut oil does help my face but I'm cautious on how I use it
290 2018-03-07 23:19:51 ケンタウロス、下半身というか馬成分が多すぎて内臓2つずつありそう
291 2018-03-07 23:19:47 I need the fresh scent like the oil 
292 2018-03-07 23:19:44 Lately I've really been thinking about going back to school when I'm done in the oil field.
293 2018-03-07 23:19:43 Ladiesssss! We have privilege and we need to learn how to use it lol I just went in for an oil change and ended up getting my tail light fixed for FREE  just be nice and smile, don’t even need to really flirt
294 2018-03-07 23:19:25 Because the infinity wars is actually the war on oil.
295 2018-03-07 23:19:23 I want to go with you to their office!
296 2018-03-07 23:19:22 Washington wants to eliminate the competition in oil and gas. First Iraq knocked out, secondly Libya nocked out. War on Syria prolonged by US Coalition and Venezuela invasion coming up. Last but not least Russia.

298 2018-03-07 23:19:06 Great idea.Lets fill the air we breath with toxic fumes from deadly chemicals,kill the oceans with oil spills,speed up extinction of many animals & ruin our land with uranium & coal mining in order to advance business & stimulate the economy.

301 2018-03-07 23:18:49 Last year you were the biggest Oil fan.....huh......wonder what happened?
302 2018-03-07 23:18:38 They are privately owned. However like I said, that bakery got sued for not making a cake for a gay couple so I would think they can be sued for this. I would think SOME atty would be brave enough to take this on... @PGutierrez630
303 2018-03-07 23:18:35 I have adopted the Hindi “-wallah” as a great suffix for all vendors of things. Gotta go to the carwallah to get my oil change.
304 2018-03-07 23:18:28 I used the liz earle cleanser along with witch hazel as toner with an oil free moisturiser and it’s done wonders! My skin was bad before too

306 2018-03-07 23:18:11 #OOTT Next year at CERAWeek, Barkindo will go have dinner with Chinese cab drivers punting all day long in the brand new Yuan-denominated Chinese oil contract in order to understand what really is driving the market. Maybe he’ll find them clever. Can’t wait...
307 2018-03-07 23:18:10 @Zam_Luke nicked an individual fried egg pan from work once and it revolutionised eggs for me. Cook the egg on low with a good glug of oil and you don’t get the burned bottom/unset top debacle

310 2018-03-07 23:17:11 My oil change cost me SEVENTY DOLLARS IM VERY ANGRY
311 2018-03-07 23:16:58 @Audi @AudiCanada #Audi_Halifax  (1) Halifax dealership place is gorgeous, very nice and clean, but no good service, only care about money but not the customer interest and satisfaction. 
Dropped my Q5 for air bag recall I asked for oil and filter change as well.
312 2018-03-07 23:16:57 U should wear oil free lotion then a face primer then ur foundation. Primer is my bff fo real

315 2018-03-07 23:16:52 bucky’s hair grew so much in wakanda cos they made him discover the magical elixirs that are castor oil and argon oil
316 2018-03-07 23:16:42 And i mix a little coconut oil with my moisturizer. I know people talk shit about using that but it really helps my skin stay moisturized
317 2018-03-07 23:16:42 This tea tree oil and moisturizer is clearing up my acne so quick it’s amazing
318 2018-03-07 23:16:36 It's cannabis oil plus some other anti-microbial oils to fight colds and flus.
319 2018-03-07 23:16:16 It’s much more boring than one might expect! But one must preheat the oven to 180, cube a sweet potato, drizzle with olive oil and whack in the oven for 25 mins. Then slice some pepper, an onion, some lil cherry tomatoes and chuck some frozen sweetcorn over in the same tray...

321 2018-03-07 23:15:58 We can't make it better when we rely on pocket money from WM and have to use it to mitigate Tory and Labour policies. Don't forget they both want to spend billions on Trident, money taken from our North Sea oil and gas fields
322 2018-03-07 23:15:53 Sounds reasonable. Smashing devices and bleach bitting them is also standard acceptable protocol.
323 2018-03-07 23:15:45 there is something so therapeutic about talking a warm bath, conditioning your hair, and putting coconut oil all over your skin

327 2018-03-07 23:15:19 Too much oil can kill your car faster than anything.  It creates too much pressure inside the engine, basically like putting too much water in a water balloon
328 2018-03-07 23:15:14 サイコじゃん……
329 2018-03-07 23:14:55 Get the oil, get the oil!
330 2018-03-07 23:14:45 I really gotta do an oil change. Guess I should go up to Vallejo this weekend sigh
331 2018-03-07 23:14:45 #IfIWereTheLastPersonOnEarth I'd have to change the oil in my car :(
332 2018-03-07 23:14:42 Yep. This is based simple primary energy stats that divide all energy into coal, oil, gas and non - fossil.
333 2018-03-07 23:14:42 we love oil sykes
334 2018-03-07 23:14:36 What does your average middle class Republican get from oil companies? Are they all employed there? I own oil stocks (or did), that doesn't change how science works. Fear of change? I'm afraid change, I hate change. That doesn't impact my view of carbon dioxide.
335 2018-03-07 23:14:16 I would boil the sweet potato and bake them for about 20 minutes. I would blanche the kale and then sautee with ginger and oil.
336 2018-03-07 23:14:00 We just got some new *Apple Kush 1G - Hood Oil*
337 2018-03-07 23:13:59 Noooo it’ll look like that in the bucket after it’s been drained 99% of the time.  Now you know how to check it.  Just make sure if you’re ever low that you don’t add too much oil.  It’s ALWAYS better to be a little low rather than having too much oil.
338 2018-03-07 23:13:49 Other than having my car die in the middle of the highway this morning - had to have a man drag it off with a chain, and later found it had been using oil and needed - OIL - late to my first class, but then did fine....
339 2018-03-07 23:13:48 Where did you go to get it done? And girl I thought you knew how to change oil

341 2018-03-07 23:13:38 Actually had one of those mythical "Dreams within a dream" last night. Was leading a revolution to secede part of my Oil Rig (only part mind you) from the the UK. Woke up on the floor of the plant realising I'd slept through half my shift. Woke up again realising I'm just nuts.

343 2018-03-07 23:13:18 oil
344 2018-03-07 23:13:08 No.  There was a giant spill in Burnaby.  Do not need to endanger ourselves for a Texan or any other oil corporate parasite.
345 2018-03-07 23:13:04 .

  When and where is the public speaking going to be at?
  My idea would be to have Supertanker rapid clean up
Available in case of any  oil spills.  The Oil Companies must provide total clean up.

347 2018-03-07 23:12:53 Pruitt will try to sell Lake Erie to big oil to pay for his private jets
348 2018-03-07 23:12:51 J.B. Pritzker profits from big oil and #DAPL which oppresses Native Americans. He has also spent more in this state primary than @realDonaldTrump did in the presidential primary throughout the country. Anyone who calls him ‘progressive’ just needs to check themselves
349 2018-03-07 23:12:36 They have oil, look no futher

351 2018-03-07 23:12:28 At least that it isn't transporting Jarco Oil (Yes there is a oil company named Jarco)
352 2018-03-07 23:12:05 This oil blend called blissful magic is taking me to a lovely place.
353 2018-03-07 23:12:04 To distract from Pruitt being in the pocket of KOCH and big oil? Or from his private jets on taxpayers dime?
354 2018-03-07 23:11:45 Cool what's the locations. I might slide. If the time right.
355 2018-03-07 23:11:38 That’s pretty much how this is. I use it after a wash. I wash twice a week. Oil every day
356 2018-03-07 23:11:23 That email.  “Mr Trump. Putin says yay to $ in oil if you drop sanctions.  Ps. Well fix election so you make shit loads money from tax dodge”. Was hacked.

360 2018-03-07 23:10:46 There are jot spills every day. And there hasn't been one oil spill in BC'S waters due to Kinder Morgan shipping out of Burnaby.

363 2018-03-07 23:09:46 Yup gave it back to the state so that they could sell it to oil companies to rip apart for profit
364 2018-03-07 23:09:40 Learn how to read. Use links. Use facts: during recession trade deficit went down because US as well as world are importing less...US importing less oil. After recession and economy cycled through US started importing more and more oil because of demand which increased deficit.
365 2018-03-07 23:09:23 Also, the dough I make is easy!  Fleishman's makes a Pizza Yeast that does not require rising.  I use the dough hooks on my hand-mixer in place of kneading and it's even faster still!  I use olive oil and add some corn meal for crunch!
366 2018-03-07 23:09:20 All of my vehicles I change the oil around 5,000 miles.  If you pull your dipstick every once in awhile and the level is fine and the oil appears somewhat transparent (just not black) you’re ok to still run it
367 2018-03-07 23:08:58 I was thinking of switching from eating a stick  of butter for breakfast to drinking a cup of olive oil what you think?

370 2018-03-07 23:08:43 I started doing pure Jamaican black castor oil hair masks all day every Sunday, and my baby hairs are growing in so heavily.
371 2018-03-07 23:08:40 Vit E oil is everything!! As well as argon oil! I use them both raw
372 2018-03-07 23:08:38 Idk about mixing the two!!! I just use rose water as the toner and tea tree oil on like, targeted spotty areas. Because I've heard tea tree can be quite drying
373 2018-03-07 23:08:27 I’ll try the coconut oil
374 2018-03-07 23:08:23 No estoy de acuerdo, cuando tus productos tienen insumos importados, automáticamente suben de precio y eso impacta en inflación. Dólar up, oil up, más caro el transporte, sube todo lo q se mueve por camión.. dólar up = infleta...
375 2018-03-07 23:08:16 Really disappointed with #naasoil I am a long standing customer for years and I’ve completely runout, ordered last week I’m told it will be delivered Saturday but they have already taken the payment for the oil  no chance of trying another supplier now

378 2018-03-07 23:07:57 There's also no THC in the hemp oil, which should prevent her from getting the 'munchies' and thinking she can 'fly'.
379 2018-03-07 23:07:57 In any case, it's no longer as guaranteed as it was before. Maybe if you are earning a ton of cash as a new graduate you may buy a car but there is transit, there is ride sharing so you may use the car less; all result in dec consumption. When oil price increases at pump, use dec
380 2018-03-07 23:07:42 It should be pointed out that the benefit is to the Oil and Gas executives and not the hundreds of thousands of direct and indirect workers that make an honest living from them. Issues is Oil and Gas needs to diversify and retrain, but old men sitting at desk don't care as usual.

385 2018-03-07 23:06:57 I'm not so sure of the increase in car purchases by young folks. The philosophy of sharing seems to be big. If you are ride sharing you don't bother to buy a car. Also I think kids aren't earning as much so cars may be purchased later. All these matters contribute to less oil use
386 2018-03-07 23:06:52 She's an old cunning Labrador - she's already crazy hungry for food and attention. 
I've done quite a bit of research and are willing to try it. She's been on fish oil, but given the state of our rivers/oceans, I'm not convince of the purity of that anymore.
387 2018-03-07 23:06:47 New trick of the day: Hot hot shower...before you step in squeeze about 10-15 drops of Eucalyptus Oil in the hot steamy water. BOOM! At Home Spa Shower! My shower life has changed and my whole room smells like Eucalyptus!! In Love! Tomorrow I’ll try Peppermint oil
388 2018-03-07 23:06:37 @WhiteHouse IMO sunni salafist Shabaab imams,muftis financed by wealthy sunni wahabbi Gulf Oil donors are the destructive force but since their donations control DC & Fake Media CEO's, no one will expose them ,while they whine as the victims, right?
389 2018-03-07 23:06:35 6trn and they took all the money including our foreign reserve and fruitful crude oil money with nothing to show.

401 2018-03-07 23:04:53 I feel like I’m always getting an oil change 
402 2018-03-07 23:04:34 Cold pressed/cold processed Castor oil. It is a game changer. I mix it with jojoba oil and vitamin e. Or just by itself.
403 2018-03-07 23:04:27 Scoottypuff Jr needs repair (vibrating when braking) but in the year I’ve been here in Chicago I’ve only taken car in twice: oil change and alternator. Place that did alternator mostly only works on <10 year old cars so..

405 2018-03-07 23:03:58 The best thing what you can do is take the cannabis oil or if you really wanna smoke do it your own, grow a plant and do it all yourself so you know 100% it’s kinda safe
406 2018-03-07 23:03:46 I would be able to talk to animals #IfIHadASuperpower then I would know why our dog doesnt eat his food but loves coconut oil 
407 2018-03-07 23:03:39 Anyone wanna tell me why these men were out here changing my oil and my car started smoking???? I did not pay you to mess more stuff up. It already has enough problems ppl.
408 2018-03-07 23:03:34 There are a lot of cake recipes that use mayo in place of eggs and oil. (They don’t taste like egg salad)
409 2018-03-07 23:03:21 Also, rotate your tires each time you have your oil changed!

412 2018-03-07 23:03:05 You can’t be this dense. Russia is basically a deserted gas station, all they have left is oil exports. So when Trump invests in America’s alternative energy sources, he’s basically shutting down Russia. Educate yourself!
413 2018-03-07 23:03:00 I've not heard that they ingested (ate) it - but a shellfish toxin could potentially be dispersed in a solvent (oil) which was rubbed on the skin. The toxin's just a molecule (solid or liquid) so plenty of ways to get it into a human

415 2018-03-07 23:02:33 Fat is one of the three main macronutrients, along with carbohydrate and protein. Fats, also known as triglycerides, are esters of three fatty acid chains and the alcohol glycerol. The terms "lipid", "oil" and "fat" are often confused.

419 2018-03-07 23:02:30 No, not at all! Your grandad reminds me of certain of my own family members. Especially the porridge. I remember one of my uncles used to eat his mixed with cod liver oil. Now THAT’S disgusting!
420 2018-03-07 23:02:24 I just wish businesses would open the doors and close their mouths. 

And patrons, walk in and do your business. We dont need to know who you love, where you wizz, identify as, voted for or if you like guns. Not my issue or problem! 

You can have the soapbox back now. Thanks

425 2018-03-07 23:01:47 When they are sleeping, you should be working, talent alone is not enough.

Burn that midnight oil. 
426 2018-03-07 23:01:44 Chicken frying in oil is dirty talk ^^
427 2018-03-07 23:01:41 I watched it!  I even put some olive oil in my hair!
428 2018-03-07 23:01:38 Koch Bros: (and all the rest of the extreme right) Keep your noses out of politics attempting to manipulate for personal gain. Isn’t your multi-billion $$ oil refining / distribution business along with your venture capital investments enough? When will u stop lying?
429 2018-03-07 23:01:34 Ok...that’s what I’m wondering. I can use this and only have to apply 2-3x a week depending. Oil I have to do daily. This doesn’t keep the hair down like balm but it’s soft & manageable for daily use. I like his, but I’m always looking.
430 2018-03-07 23:01:33 An u say this every wensday

434 2018-03-07 23:01:24 so, uh, this might be an outlier, but once i didn't clean a plastic measuring spoon after i'd used it for clove oil and it melted the spoon. 

what if it melts your vagina?!
435 2018-03-07 23:01:24 I used my straightening iron to curl my hair. For some reason, my right side usually looks better than the left side haha. Then put some oil into the ends and then braided my bangs 
436 2018-03-07 23:01:23 Perhaps the oil industry should have thought about the future before they investing big bucks? I'm guessing the Trump guy is going to be more protectionist and therefore the oil industry in AB will stagnate long term. It's a free market and oil industry has risk management.#Ableg
437 2018-03-07 23:01:20 tbh i think it has to do with oil or something. because it mainly happened to me when i was working at long johns. but once i left there it stopped happening as much
438 2018-03-07 23:01:19 Coal ash...just as bad as oil.

442 2018-03-07 23:00:31 How's the solar panels working today in New York?  Mini ice age can happen. Buy coal, NG, and oil to prepare for the worst.
443 2018-03-07 23:00:28 "oil", that is. Not sure what happens if you partially hydrogenate an oik.

448 2018-03-07 23:00:18 So back to the BOOMx4. Seems to me there are already more than 4 BOOMS. Oil Production, Gold Standard talk, HRC tapes, DOJ suing CA, Fast&Furious investigation, Kerry Investigation... Which are the real BOOMS?
449 2018-03-07 23:00:18 All my coworkers sell that shit. One of them invited me to an essential oil party and I was like “can I just come to the party or is the snake oil... essential” and they stopped inviting me haha
450 2018-03-07 22:59:54 Nag champa oil smells so damn good
451 2018-03-07 22:59:36 @AnandasAromas Hi, I am looking to purchase some cacao absolute essential oil. Wanted to know do you ship to Canada?
452 2018-03-07 22:59:26 Reminds of doctors & researchers changing opinion on how bad coconut oil was, how cholesterol would kill you and so on, both of which have now been corrected after 30-40 years.  never say never.
453 2018-03-07 22:59:25 Beard oil.

I can't recommend bear oil. That sounds threatening.
454 2018-03-07 22:59:24 I'm afraid that politicians are far to lax with our cash. It's a ton of money. The debt slaves (us) will be paying for the liabilties of the oil industry plus the debt by all levels of government. It's not peanuts to me. Citizens need to hold gov hires accountable for cash waste.

457 2018-03-07 22:58:58 I like the Shea, tea tree oil, and super berry ones!
458 2018-03-07 22:58:54 Coconut oil once a week makes my silkier than it’s ever been in my life! 

Just make sure to shampoo twice after to get all the oil residue out, figured that out the hard way 
459 2018-03-07 22:58:36 1B, then 2b, then 3.5B all burning lots of coal and oil allowed humanity to progress tremendously. 
But people have known for a while that a bill would eventually come due for all that benefit. 

Now there are 7.5 billion burning it. 
Time to change.
460 2018-03-07 22:58:36 agree with all that.  I guess we're a long way from electric cars/solar power making a dent in oil demand.  wishful thinking
461 2018-03-07 22:58:30 Can you cook chicken and veggies with beer instead of oil? Lmk soon before I sabotage the last meal of vacation.

463 2018-03-07 22:57:39 It depends on the oil that’s put into it.  There is a once a year oil out now.  VWs are very specific though.
Also the “oil light” is loosely called the “idiot” light.
464 2018-03-07 22:57:37 はい。
465 2018-03-07 22:57:29 Al bring me tanning oil
466 2018-03-07 22:57:28 @burkesback and anyone who might know. If you want to make jet fuel (which is apparently in demand) can you use NE oil or bitumen?  (Assuming you have a refinery that can do it - not a question about whether a refinery is a good idea.)
467 2018-03-07 22:57:01 That's awful! What IS that? Oil?
468 2018-03-07 22:56:54 It'll be killer.
469 2018-03-07 22:55:59 Okay, but where do you find the oil ?
470 2018-03-07 22:55:39 So the students will be both Woke and Cold.  Lol
471 2018-03-07 22:55:24 petroleum reserves are dollar, money is more valuable, Muslim blood is inexpensive, petroleum calendars are valuable, world Muslims do not like oil,
472 2018-03-07 22:55:06 Drives me crazy as a vet that I’m prepared to say “it will be fine it’s got an immune system .. don’t worry” and I get grief for  not being holistic by those who always intervene often with pointless snake oil. 
Good on you

481 2018-03-07 22:54:15 Because they focus on primary energy (before the burning of #oil, #natgas, #coal) rather than final energy? And, don't count sunshine/wind as "primary" but solely #solar & #windturbine output?

491 2018-03-07 22:52:53 It's not ideal to use clay masks on dry skin because it will dry it even further. Clay absorbs excess oil. Rather use a cream mask.

496 2018-03-07 22:52:42 Woo! Are you going show them how a moonshiner drives those winding back roads? (You can't spray oil on the road, can you?)
497 2018-03-07 22:52:39 It’s a fine concept on a solar/wind powered farm, but our grid isn’t powered by them right now, and would have to be for this system to claim it’s clean. All that extra power would come from coal/oil/gas currently. That conversion also makes it effectively a one-time use battery.
498 2018-03-07 22:52:13 Goodnight haashim, keep dreaming about that UCL trophy... maybe another couple hundred million of that oil money next season will finally get you one!

500 2018-03-07 22:51:57 After asking everyone that I know who doesn't like Trump, it seems most will agree when you press them that 'free trade' isn't the highest order good. 'Free trade' that yields loss of culture, loss of sovereignty (imagine if the U.S. depends on Saudi Oil, e.g.) isn't good.

503 2018-03-07 22:51:21 Did the research look at younger people who maytakefish oil for high cholesterol who have yet to develop heart disease, buthave a predisposition? It doesn’t seem to talk about fish oil related to preventative medicine.

506 2018-03-07 22:51:10 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.
507 2018-03-07 22:51:10 You don’t know what you are talking about. The trade deficit reduced because the world went into a global recession. Everybody in the world was importing less because of less demand so trade deficit went down. Main reason trade deficit went down in 2009 was oil imports stopped.

514 2018-03-07 22:50:07 Nobody will succeed with NK. They just get more advanced toys to threaten with for their food, oil and cash. They cooperate for a while, then do the same thing next year.

521 2018-03-07 22:49:28 Quebecers are just as bad as the Americans that are trying to keep Canada's oil out of the market. Trudeau goes along with quebecers so he can get their freaking votes again in 2019.
522 2018-03-07 22:49:27 Okay but why is olive oil so expensive?
523 2018-03-07 22:49:25 The Saudi's are not our friend. They now made an effort to look more moderate but it is all window dressing as the world becomes less dependent on their oil exports. A wolf in wolf's clothing -  what you see is what you get = Mohammed's islam that is not compatible with the west
524 2018-03-07 22:49:22 I cant read this but im thinking...Whatever Assad has in oil should sell it to Russia on the cheap and keep out the US war mongers..When the oil runs out the winds will change because you cant run a war machine without fuel. God bless the righteouis.
525 2018-03-07 22:49:19 Estimates place 2050 as when oil production & consumption will peak.
526 2018-03-07 22:49:18 The raising prices of steel will raise the price of oil and gas.

530 2018-03-07 22:49:09 I never liked how oil makes up alot of CPI. its certainly a big part of money spent, but there could be a shift to electric over next decade. CPI index needs to adjust for that assuming it happens.

542 2018-03-07 22:47:43 The problem is Malcolm, we get the wrong impression about investment in energy. Financial institutions have been so brow beaten by Greenies they fear to invest in real energy, coal, oil and gas.
543 2018-03-07 22:47:37 Out of millions of Danes, just 87000 homes were heated by oil last year; most are on district heating systems that recover waste industrial heat. Why bother tweeting something so easily rebutted?
544 2018-03-07 22:47:30 Oh yeah I remember that! Now instead of coconut oil I use CeraVe moisturizing cream. It's the truth!!
545 2018-03-07 22:47:30 The smart strategy would be to stop importing oil from the US and use Canadian oil. Energy East, anyone?
546 2018-03-07 22:47:17 I agree with Katherine- developing countries are focusing on fossil fuels without giving much thought to renewable energy sources. What will happen when there are coal, oil, and gas shortages? We will turn to renewable energy, but it might be too late at that point. #PHYS273

559 2018-03-07 22:46:04 The strategy of SA and some emirates and Iran as the counterpart and Russia as a beneficial is to feet the war to partizipate on a high oil-price. As long as they have oil we have war.

561 2018-03-07 22:45:42 olive oil mediterranean vegan baltic fish
562 2018-03-07 22:45:38 It’s only because trump stopped the export of all oil from North Dakota.
563 2018-03-07 22:45:30 Sudan: oil + guns = anarchy.
564 2018-03-07 22:45:21 Same as the pig for oil/land deal...every year the same thing...i remember when jerry was talking up mayowa...loooool

566 2018-03-07 22:45:12 vinegar and olive oil on a salad isn’t bad at all 
567 2018-03-07 22:45:11 Bring it up to the crib and spray em down with olive oil and throw them on the grill.
568 2018-03-07 22:44:57 The ones that i mean are bad bc if it was okay the doctors wouldn’t be sayyin to my mom that she can’t smoke it but can take the oil. Please educate yourself sweetie
569 2018-03-07 22:44:55 タイヤじゃなくてエアロかオイル関係全交換で
570 2018-03-07 22:44:48 Girl a little bit of tea tree oil gets rid of that shit QUICK
571 2018-03-07 22:44:44 I know you go pure technical, but Trump’s possible waiver for Mexico and Canada on the tariffs changed the tape, it was a completely different day after that. Just look how oil and the spx traded before and after that news release
572 2018-03-07 22:44:40 .@Dennis_Kucinich takes heat over his position on banning oil/gas extraction in the state. @RichCordray: "That is an extreme position that will lose us eastern OH for a generation and it misses that there are many small landowners there who rely on wells as their sole income."
573 2018-03-07 22:44:28 You must have read fatal incidents in PAKISTAN, we need you there too and hire me, I have vast experience in oil and energy industry..
574 2018-03-07 22:44:23 Just make sure to get it with olive oil, have a great Wednesday
575 2018-03-07 22:44:16 Your best case for higher rates and inflation is for oil to go over $85 sending world trade data higher and the 10 year yield could break over 3.5% with that back drop
576 2018-03-07 22:44:09 ヒィイイイ！
じゃあ、自分の誕生日には妹にタイヤ交換でもしてもらいましょう！(　˙-˙　)☜
577 2018-03-07 22:44:09 mind if i rub oil on the both of you???
578 2018-03-07 22:44:08 Uh-oh! I can’t look right now. Me is broken. I had to buy heating oil again. It’s not cheap. I was hoping the last 100 gallons would get me through winter. No such luck. I gotta have it. Can’t freeze to death.
579 2018-03-07 22:44:02 Been smoking oil day today lol
580 2018-03-07 22:43:57 Did you know that before farmers settled on corn and soy to fatten their cattle, they tried coconut and it’s oil because it was cheap and plentiful. But the cattle got lean. Try a tablespoon a day. #coconut #lean #weightloss #fit #paleo #keto

582 2018-03-07 22:43:35 Does the butter have weight to it (if that makes sense)? Oil doesn’t do anything for me bcuz I have to use so much to get through the entire beard. I’ve only found one product that works so far. I looking for another
583 2018-03-07 22:43:20 Hard to say without significant time looking into the 500 studies used  for the meta-analysis, but I'm guessing the studies looked at were people on SAD and adding fish oil.. no surprise it's not a miracle pill in that case

586 2018-03-07 22:42:59 Hot shower, layered, rubbed up with eucalyptus oil and drank some ginger tea.
587 2018-03-07 22:42:57 Yeah this is mostly accurate. Trump makes sure business grow and benefits from his policies. While anything thats good for people doesn’t really matter. Corps get millions the people a extra $200. Nature parks get reduced over oil drilling.
588 2018-03-07 22:42:54 Try roasting it in the oven with olive oil, salt, pepper and Parmesan! 
589 2018-03-07 22:42:53 Flavoured it heavily with basil and mushroom and mixed in with some spinach and olive oil.
590 2018-03-07 22:42:41 Rebuild our parks? With what? Pipelines, oil wells, fracking, and maybe some mining projects? Boy that does sound like fun. I wonder who . might be getting rich from these great ideas?
591 2018-03-07 22:42:29 Yeah but, y’know, gas and oil 
592 2018-03-07 22:42:24 優しいお兄さんじゃないですか！！
593 2018-03-07 22:42:17 I Came Here For A Oil Change Now These Fuckas Tryna Find More Shit Wrong So I Can Spend More Money.. FOH
594 2018-03-07 22:42:04 Amazing how McLaren saw an oil leak as an engine problem when it was a Honda in 2017, but its not an engine problem when its a Renault engine in 2018.  Mmmm, funny about that.
595 2018-03-07 22:41:57 Or he could've said 'Oil money FC', the smallest 'big' club in the world, finally after spending 3/4 of a billion, manages to reach the quarter final comfortably. Only bump in the road was a loss to Basel and Shjaktar
596 2018-03-07 22:41:51 lavar o rosto com metodo oil cleansing é sensacional ainda bem q a minha mae @rachelsousab me educou muito bem
597 2018-03-07 22:41:41 My lil crush at work gave me a hug today and she smelled so good. I asked her what she was wearing cus it smelled familiar...it was my fav body oil from the BSS store. Im pregnit now. I dont know how we’re gonna tell her girlfriend.
598 2018-03-07 22:41:36 Aveeno Ultra-Calming facial foam is literally A1. Removes oil bit doesn't strip my skin @ the same time
599 2018-03-07 22:41:34 The Yemen war is all about oil and gas and the Saudis are running out of oil quickly and need new oil sources.

601 2018-03-07 22:40:50 What did he have on them? Paedophile ring in WM or the oil lie?
602 2018-03-07 22:40:49 @JordanTishlerMD I used a CBD oil w/Shea butter, coconut oil & Vitamin E for my Palmer's Psoriasis & it cured it by approx. 95%. Nothing else worked. Not steroids or any rx my Dermatologist gave to me. It seemed 2 help the burning pain in my feet from Hammer toe arthritis too.
603 2018-03-07 22:40:42 @TurnbullMalcolm chould take note of Saudi plan to building the mega city "Neom" free from sharia law. The Saudi's recognise sharia inhibit freedoms and for them to survive (slumping oil price since 2014), they need to be more "western" and innovative. Join  @AuConservatives.

608 2018-03-07 22:40:10 I am capitalism and the Arab Revolutions are dangerous because the region is now in a position to export both oil and revolution.
609 2018-03-07 22:39:56 More fake new from the desperate journalists at The Sun. A weak pound might give a small boost to exporters but it also means that imports of gas and oil and raw materials become a lot more expensive.
610 2018-03-07 22:39:52 Oil, gas, mining and quarrying are together only 9% of our GDP. We can afford to be smart about how we approach the balance of production and environment. This is not a fire sale.
611 2018-03-07 22:39:30 it looks like somebody shook a snowglobe in oil city,pa!!!
612 2018-03-07 22:39:15 My hair feels like heaven after I Prepoo it in coconut oil, shampoo with shea moisture JBCO,  conditioned w/ Cantu leave-in,  and oiled it 
613 2018-03-07 22:39:02 I like those thank you. They look pretty easy to make. I've been thinking about trying to make something with shredded coconut, coconut oil, and chocolate kind of like a mounds/almond joy
614 2018-03-07 22:38:59 I’m having a 28x28 oil painting done of my dog so I can hang it above his kennel idc idc
615 2018-03-07 22:38:53 Well I had to adult today! New windshield  grocery shopping  dog groomed  rotated tires and changed oil on my gf's truck  and made it home now to start supper (potato soup) and try to get my gf to feel better but she just started running a fever 
616 2018-03-07 22:38:41 まずは午前とにかく仕事を減らすのだ
617 2018-03-07 22:38:13 I am very curious as to how the safety of canabidiol (cannabis oil extract that is not as psychoactive as THC) will turn out after approval.

Greenwich Biosciences is registering it for epilepsy in children. My take so far is that it has moderate efficacy and fewer side effects.
618 2018-03-07 22:38:09 CBD OIL! That’s what I’ve done for my old lady, she eats more
619 2018-03-07 22:37:51 Jus got this call for this oil job makin 1500-2 bandz a week
620 2018-03-07 22:37:29 Definitely valid concerns, but a couple points: 1. About the same amount of CO2 is injected as results the produced oil, and that oil mostly (but not completely) displaces other oil that would have been produced in the global market. The net emissions benefit is substantial.
621 2018-03-07 22:37:21 Goes to town to look for prom shoes 
Gets a $67 oil change 
Doesn’t buy any shoes for prom
622 2018-03-07 22:36:52 @ my oil change go faster
623 2018-03-07 22:36:38 I work for an oil major. This is a shortsighted view
624 2018-03-07 22:36:23 Denise Crosby. I always liked Yar and it lessened the series when she ran into that oil slick.
625 2018-03-07 22:36:17 Don’t give mother Earth a crude oil bukkake.
626 2018-03-07 22:36:16 Having worked in the oil field for years let me say this has nothing to do with Trump. Drilling was up 14% on federal lands under Obama, and only Obama ended the 40yr. Oil embargo. #DonTheCon #CadetBoneSpurs #IMissObama
627 2018-03-07 22:35:58 Does anyone know where I can get the best Jamaican castor oil for my hair ?
628 2018-03-07 22:35:44 #IfIWereTheLastPersonOnEarth Olive Oil wouldn't date me.
629 2018-03-07 22:35:41 Isn't oil basically made of dinosaurs? They might have a plan after all ...
630 2018-03-07 22:35:36 oil
631 2018-03-07 22:35:30 ありがとう～｡ﾟ(ﾟ´Д｀ﾟ)ﾟ｡
632 2018-03-07 22:35:29 There certainly are plenty of options on the market. Just like changing your oil: so easy anyone can do it themselves, yet some people don't know an oil filter from an air filter or wouldn't know where to find the plug - so they pay someone who can help. Different strokes...
633 2018-03-07 22:35:13 *creeeeeeeeeeak* I need me some oil
634 2018-03-07 22:35:13 Teddy a is dumb.stop doubting ifu she's correct bcs Nigeria has less companies compared to Asia, Europe and America nd ur busy telling her that Nigeria is 5th largest oil producing country in d world. #BBNaija
635 2018-03-07 22:35:12 The USA needs to leech off other countries to survive. It wouldn't be engaged in constant war otherwise. What happens when those dictatorships are toppled? What happens when oil reserves are depleted?
636 2018-03-07 22:35:08 CBD oil too!!
637 2018-03-07 22:35:07 When I retired from the oil business due to cancer in 2008 I was making the same wage my Grandfather made in 1978. He had 45 years experience as a pipefitter/shipfitter when he retired and helped to build the Missouri during WWII. I'd call that flat wage growth.
638 2018-03-07 22:35:02 James 5:14 Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer of faith will save the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up. #MarchWOSE

642 2018-03-07 22:34:40 I took my pizza out the oven and it dropped hot oil on my foot and gave me a blister 
643 2018-03-07 22:34:18 He may not take money from big oil but it sure as heck sounds like he answers to Big Magma and the Lahar Lobby.
644 2018-03-07 22:34:18 The decision is final. I do not like truffle oil. #sueme
645 2018-03-07 22:34:09 I totally believe, that dry wells can start producing again, but that is something different than re-newing
.
Oil is basically biological material, decomposed without air under tons of rock, it takes eons to mature. 
Since no new biological material is added, it doesn't re-new.
646 2018-03-07 22:34:05 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.
647 2018-03-07 22:34:03 then a burnt umber oil pin wash. simples :)
648 2018-03-07 22:33:44 Yes, according to what @doctorselassie said, there are MANY drug interactions & one should use CBD oil ONLY under the care of a licensed professional who can determine dosing, etc. I would never take it without consulting a medical professional.

662 2018-03-07 22:31:56 Listen to Moonbeam's audio response - very bizarre choice of words.  This was the governor who used state employees to survey his own private acreage for oil and the state has $1T debt obligations

670 2018-03-07 22:31:10 Every US manufacturer would suffer from higher metal prices,
Iron and aluminum are commodities and priced by global markets, the US is a fraction of global steel and aluminum demand now and unlike oil the Chinese, Russian and Indians are the main producers and speculators.
671 2018-03-07 22:31:08 Why @ITVCentral do we need Saudis We are being used ! When they have got what they want this diverse from oil then they will not need west !

680 2018-03-07 22:30:20 God, imagine your politicians standing up for your enviro right now. Saying ‘we’re phasing out oil and gas. We’re going to put what we know about our planet’s health in to action NOW. ‘
681 2018-03-07 22:29:52 I find this post interesting considering you helped pass a bill that has the potential to pollute vast regions of the pristine attic wilderness. When oil spills on land where do you think it leaches into, hint, it’s not the sky
682 2018-03-07 22:29:50 I hate this country’s kowtowing to the Saudi’s. God awful, bigoted, misogynistic regime. But hey ho they have oil so we will roll out the red carpet
683 2018-03-07 22:29:32 Sorry Zinke, it's the other way around! Oil companies should never be partnered with, polluting our interior.

690 2018-03-07 22:29:04 The halving of global oil prices since 2014 was nt passed down to Kenyan consumers now Kenya is Broke as hell. I bet that money that was saved from oil prices slup didn't go to GoK accounts. If Global oil prices where to return to pre-2014 how would life be for the average Kenyan

694 2018-03-07 22:28:17 It's not about the overall benefits; it is about the benefits to their constituency, the oil, coal, and gas industries.
695 2018-03-07 22:28:01 Perhaps try applying conditioner or product/oil before swimming. Your hair won’t absorb as much of the chlorine.
696 2018-03-07 22:27:55 if you're going to use an oil, wouldn't jojoba be the safest bet?
697 2018-03-07 22:27:45 Sebastian walked inside. He had in mind to apologise. "James... Boss. Sir..." 
His eyes fixed on a folder resting on the Irishman's desk. The air in the room was stuffy but the folder smelled of motor oil and the outside. "Has Mrs H been?" Sebastian shook his head, that —
698 2018-03-07 22:27:28 Olive oil garlic mushroom tomatoes. Officially my poor man's work lunch for the next week. Buy in bulk, kids
699 2018-03-07 22:27:25 Again bacteria with activated PETRO-BACTIN GENES MAKES THE BACTERIA CONSUME OIL & SHALE -- THEREIN NOT PRODUCE SHALE & OIL
700 2018-03-07 22:27:08 If I had a superpower I would  massage  a mans feet with olive oil and mashed avocado with my hands preferably jimmy fallons feet. Just a idea?? #ifihadasuperpower
701 2018-03-07 22:26:47 Only Carman A. Grider, Merlyn Pulikathara, Mark Miner, Haymon Gentry are known to be working with Dick Cheney, Obama, Bush, Clinton purposely putting terpene-Carbon allotropes in oil reservoirs with Eric Davenport & Candice Young to activate Petro-bactin genes
702 2018-03-07 22:26:35 NZ Twitter - where can one buy a nice oil diffuser?
703 2018-03-07 22:26:14 What “reforms” EXACTLY, Boris? We’d like to know if they will give up totalitarian Islam, accept equality for women, ban FGM, ban the Burqa and halal killing. No? You must need those oil, defence and trade deals so badly.
704 2018-03-07 22:25:57 Marketing strategies are like oil tankers, the market opportunity will outpace the speed at which these guys will move. I expect the US will be an exception!
705 2018-03-07 22:25:50 #NP Pour Your Oil by @thejoshuarogers Joshua Rogers on #KRGN_985FM
706 2018-03-07 22:25:50 I use OIL! I'll send you a pic. Its so good for your hair and doesn't weigh it down but takes control of the fuzzies!!!
707 2018-03-07 22:25:48 Its Bluebird. He's a farmer's oil drum that had thomas's face painted on after a rare bird made a nest by it.
708 2018-03-07 22:25:42 Anyone pretending our rights are the cause of crime & stripping the law abiding of their rights will turn criminals into law abiding citizens is a moron and/or dangerous leftist selling something far worse than snake oil.
709 2018-03-07 22:25:37 The coconut oil has a weaker hold imo, but it flakes WAAAAAAYYYYYY less than the olive oil.
710 2018-03-07 22:25:33 Come in for an oil change and they tell me I need an air filter, two new front tires, both front and back brakes replaced, and an alignment... ANYTHING ELSE? Might as well get a new car.
711 2018-03-07 22:25:21 TERPENES ACTIVATE IN OIL PRODUCTION FIELDS THE PETRO-BACTIN GENE IN OIL PRODUCING BACTERIA WHERE PETRO-BACTIN IS known to consume Oil & shale therein decreasing productions if carbon allotrope is included with terpenes
712 2018-03-07 22:25:06 My muhfuckin' oil changes be expensive as hell, FAHK.
713 2018-03-07 22:24:53 I never leave the fucking body shop in a good mood. With out fail this is what happens 
1. I come on for an oil change and general check ups
2. They come and tell me there is something else wrong with my car which adds up the price and it's a necessity so it needs to be done
714 2018-03-07 22:24:52 Big Oil and fossil fuels are effectively in power.
715 2018-03-07 22:24:40 Ahhhhh shit, I’ve done that, thought my mom had sunblock, & my dumbass thought tanning oil was the same shit 
716 2018-03-07 22:24:36 I second that motion sir.
717 2018-03-07 22:24:34 FOCKIN OIL M8
718 2018-03-07 22:24:22 No. No. No. your job is to protect our land @RyanZinke. Stop selling it out for greedy oil drillers.
719 2018-03-07 22:24:20 Hello Everyone !
720 2018-03-07 22:24:12 Can someone point me towards a full coverage matte foundation that will last me more that 5 hours before I start looking like a pool of oil by 2pm?! 
721 2018-03-07 22:24:11 In my clinical experience, it's easy to binge on foods that are mainly processed carbs (soda, popcorn, bread, pretzel, cereal). Hard to binge on foods that are mainly fat (olive oil, butter, avocado), and they would elicit intense satiety. Do you disagree?
722 2018-03-07 22:24:06 I have been through these reports and talked to structural engineers in the UK to confirm those conclusions. Let's say I accept it was Saudis, why invade Iraq? For oil, this is known so it was US terrorism and you sit here claiming we hate you. You came to our lands, stole and...
723 2018-03-07 22:24:05 The two sides of the CBD oil debate: pain and relief.
724 2018-03-07 22:24:03 Also... like Oil executives give a rat’s ass about birds.
725 2018-03-07 22:24:02 The International Energy Agency March 2018 report concluded that while U.S. supply alone can meet 80% of world oil demand growth to 2020, additional investment will be needed to meet global demand after 2020.  The industry has yet to recover from a multi year drop in investment.
726 2018-03-07 22:24:01 I do not buy beauty products that contain coconut oil... period. Coconut oil 
• clogs my pores & causes break outs
• dries my hair & skin
I stay far away.
727 2018-03-07 22:23:44 OGX is really good, and pretty widely available and inexpensive. It’s my go-to when I’m on a budget and can’t buy Paul Mitchell (or to keep around for traveling.) The argan oil one is my favorite.
728 2018-03-07 22:23:40 Anybody know somewhere I can get an oil change
729 2018-03-07 22:23:06 Last time swampy filmed me outside BB I had me shorts on lool.lBuggers put me live on the internet to!
730 2018-03-07 22:22:55 Coconut Oil Eco Styler > Olive Oil Eco Styler.
731 2018-03-07 22:22:49 Just lost power one retweet = one oil lamp
732 2018-03-07 22:22:37 my hair needs a wash & trim but i can’t find my specific hair oil or conditioner in no store here
733 2018-03-07 22:22:34 How about Russian Vodka, oil and gas! Nerve gas another one to tarriff, we dont need any..
734 2018-03-07 22:22:26 OK, I think it's time we had a frank and honest discussion about this, and please answer in earnest because it's a subject that's very dear to me.

How often do you oil your cheeseboard?
735 2018-03-07 22:22:25 To be honest, that seems like an oxymoron.  There is no clean oil and gas just like there is no clean gas.  Especially with all the methane leakage.
736 2018-03-07 22:22:19  Crazy!! We grew up in the mountains of the Berkshires in MA. I remember my mom shoveling a path for the oil delivery guy & I couldn’t even see her, she’s 5’2”. I just saw snow flying up in the air lol.
737 2018-03-07 22:22:12 I saw Osunde today.. bro.. felt so sad.. looked homeless rocking almost rags stained wit oil
738 2018-03-07 22:22:12 They’re all coming for Bitcorn. Just like they came for wheat, Barley and oil.
739 2018-03-07 22:21:58 Just received my castor oil (hopefully to grow these sparse little eyebrows) AND I have my haircut tomorrow and can I just say that I’ve done my research and beauty wise, I’m totally ready to party.
740 2018-03-07 22:21:56 hmm, maybe try clay masks then? they're real good for drawing out all the oil and gunk from your face, but it isn't exactly an overnight thing and they can be a little drying. you should be fine if you moisturize after tho
741 2018-03-07 22:21:49 Yuck
742 2018-03-07 22:21:37 Came to the shop for a $50 oil change and ended up spending  $100 
743 2018-03-07 22:21:30 Fish oil, biotin, all that good stuff
744 2018-03-07 22:21:27 Plus we need a Dem legislature.  But not sure that would even do the trick given the power of oil and gas.
745 2018-03-07 22:21:23 nothing routine oil change/tire rotation but apparently i had a nail in my tire but I’m all good now
746 2018-03-07 22:21:18 1st ever blockchain conference in Saudi Arabia, 3rd week of April. Could see interesting bchain integrations. (Oil anybody?) Low market cap. dApp platform.
747 2018-03-07 22:21:13 ありがとうございます！！
睡眠頑張ってください(´；ω；`)
748 2018-03-07 22:21:09 i can see how it’d be really nice if you don’t wear makeup but trying to take mascara off with the oil was like pouring acid directly into my eyeballs it hurts so bad ajsjdhsjs
749 2018-03-07 22:20:55 This is why we need to reach 100% renewables as soon as possible.  Oil and gas extraction in Colorado is out of control.
750 2018-03-07 22:20:53 Define, explain and synthesize are 3 words that are not in trumps vocabulary. Maybe some nice pictures of dollar bills, coke cans and some oil pipelines combined with those maps of different countries along with pictures of people freaking out wondering what to plan business wise
751 2018-03-07 22:20:53 Ambode is forgetting that Lagos was built by Nigeria's oil revenues and people from other states
752 2018-03-07 22:20:34 Yuck. Just yuck. What real woman would ever want weenies like them? No wonder they're feminists!
753 2018-03-07 22:20:30 My girl has cradle cap and coconut oil is her best friend rn.
754 2018-03-07 22:20:19 You put BC jobs at risk by systematically blocking the expansion of AB oil delivery volumes to the West Coast.  You bully a weak AB NDP shamelessly, now it is your turn.
755 2018-03-07 22:20:10 RT @LivingSafely: Haven't changed your vehicle's oil since November? Why not make an appointment at the garage today!
756 2018-03-07 22:20:10 Garnier Whole Blends is my fav right now - avocado oil and shea butter! Mmm!
757 2018-03-07 22:20:08 And check out the sentence for the Grenfell guy who had a cannabis oil factory.
758 2018-03-07 22:20:01 What a joke! He is supposed to be the best deal maker who hires the best! A joker and the oil man!
759 2018-03-07 22:20:00 I was having a great day until I found a SPIDER in my ESSENTIAL OIL DIFFUSER. A SPIDER!!!!!
760 2018-03-07 22:20:00 Oh. Well... that’s definitely not good.

“Um.. Oil, I think? Or... nail polish remover?” Nail polish remover tends to solve most problems like this, he’s found.
761 2018-03-07 22:20:00 got an oil change at my dealership & they gave me a free car wash , for the price of the damn oil change , ima need a car wash inside & out but I’m grateful 
762 2018-03-07 22:19:56 dividing n creating groups in Syria/Middle East is the main US policy,while Arabs n Muslims kill each other *US demand gas n oil*
763 2018-03-07 22:19:48 When you’re just trinna get your oil changed, but people insist on talking to you. I don’t even think I look friendly 
764 2018-03-07 22:19:44 I strongly recommend oil of oregano. It’s worked wonders for stopping colds in their tracks. It’s gross though 
765 2018-03-07 22:19:33 I didn't know it's a system  it just seemed logical and works really well for me. Honestly just even rinsing with the oil works well for me.
766 2018-03-07 22:19:24 [Text from Weiss] 

Well I mean you arnt wrong but my shampoo strips the natural oil so I have to replace it so its not brittle and breaks.... are you okay Blake?
767 2018-03-07 22:19:14 but you don’t have to do that, you can use one or the other. i have both and prefer the foam bc the oil stings really bad if i get it in my eyes but i am sensitive to stuff like that. i just use a wipe to take off my makeup first. idk if that helps
768 2018-03-07 22:19:05 Senate committee kills bill to rewrite state policy on oil and gas
769 2018-03-07 22:19:02 Your vagina does not shed oil the same way it sheds silicone and water-based products. We don't recommend using it at my store, however some people have incredibly resilient vaginas!
770 2018-03-07 22:19:00 ダイエットしていたって、時にはオイルも必要だろう?
771 2018-03-07 22:19:00 Yah, that someone decided to drown in oil. WTF is that?!!
772 2018-03-07 22:18:48 I don't think we need to be dragged. Judging by the last 20ish years it's obvious the US can't get enough of regime change... only in oil rich areas, of course.
773 2018-03-07 22:18:40 When the oil 99% THC 
774 2018-03-07 22:18:38 wow I def must have had dry socket, any and all pain is gone in the cavern where my wisdom tooth used to reside. clove oil is magic.
775 2018-03-07 22:18:33 We can add as much renewable as we like but until we *massively reduce* use of oil and gas, *and* pull gigatonnes of existing carbon out of the atmosphere, all this effort is just fucking pointless. 

We need to wake up to the real scale of the problem we face.
776 2018-03-07 22:18:33 Hey ladies and gentleman I'm kyle and I'm here for all your automotive needs. looking for a new or used car or truck I have tons of selection. if you need a upgrade oil change anything here at Dhilion Automotive were here to help in anyway we can so just tweet me.
777 2018-03-07 22:18:33 深夜帯ハンター一緒に狩りを！！(:3っ)っ
778 2018-03-07 22:18:29 I think this is literally the first time I’ve ever had my oil changed where they didn’t find something else that needed to be fixed
779 2018-03-07 22:18:14 After cleaning the same way I oil mine and put them on low oven heat for about 25 minutes. 
780 2018-03-07 22:18:11 sorry to butt in but i use this system too, it’s the double cleanse that korea was (is?) all about so first you’re supposed to use the oil to remove makeup, rinse, then use the foam to wash your face after
781 2018-03-07 22:18:09 Gasoline powered engines about to go extinct fam. In the next 50 years, oil producing countries like Nigeria will start drinking their crude oil
782 2018-03-07 22:18:08 It wouldnt be self sustainable. Furthermore, why then are socialist countries not crashing America's oil economy by investing in renewable resources.
783 2018-03-07 22:18:02 Bacon grease > olive oil lol
784 2018-03-07 22:17:58 oh. 

true story, my parents read "Power of a Praying Parent' when I was in high school and anointed my room with oil in case the Coolio CD had let in demons.
785 2018-03-07 22:17:55 I'm more worried about oil streaked crash helmets and visors in races
786 2018-03-07 22:17:42 All the oil leaked out of my car Monday and I got a flat today LIFE IS GREAT
787 2018-03-07 22:17:29 First day of trying Bellarose (10yr old Lab) on Hemp oil - would have preferred CBD oil but our politicians still have their heads up the bums over that. 
Going by case studies Hemp Oil should be better for her than fish oils etc. 
We shall see !!
788 2018-03-07 22:17:24 ζήτω!! (Hurray in Greek, I think..right, Spartan Oil?) Spartan Oil is in stock!!
789 2018-03-07 22:17:21 putting aloe vera and vitamin e oil on ur face will change ur life
790 2018-03-07 22:17:21 True. As much as we want to reduce our dependence on Oil ASAP,  we have to be really STRATEGIC about it. Focusing on one or two agricultural products helps us to focus more and apply adequate resources.
791 2018-03-07 22:17:13 I feel like an actual functioning adult.. I went grocery shopping, took my trash out, did my dishes, and now im getting an oil change...

793 2018-03-07 22:16:45 Why lebanese media stopped covering the gas and oil issue with israel... ????? Have they been instructed to do so.. recently israel, cyprus, greece and italy have signed a deal for a new pipeline to Europe.
794 2018-03-07 22:16:21 ありがとうございます…
795 2018-03-07 22:16:11 I wonder if this wasn't a message o the Saudi's? "Guess what pal. Ten years from now, we'll be fully electric and have no need for your oil!"
796 2018-03-07 22:16:09 Catalonian separatist cut hundreds of trees and spend thousands of oil barrels, just to make yellow ribbons and propaganda about a fascist and racist republiq that doesn't exist.
797 2018-03-07 22:16:06 legend has it if you listen to city pop enough you’ll never be sad
798 2018-03-07 22:15:59 Notice that Israeli "buffer zone" has Syrian oil wells on it. coincidence? I think not.
799 2018-03-07 22:15:54 @realDonaldTrump Your country has nothing to give, you and your sociapaths can only take. Very soon when the oil runs out and your war machine grounds to a halt your country will be in ruins and you can suck up that arrogance and be slaves to black women mother fucker.
800 2018-03-07 22:15:52 See, I really like bacon, but I'd hate to ruin it by gorging myself on it. It's hard too, because everything in Oregon has bacon, is cooked in bacon grease, flavored with a bacon oil, etc.

804 2018-03-07 22:15:22 I do olive oil at 375 for 40 min. Criiispy. *i didnt read previous tweets if you did the same*
805 2018-03-07 22:15:17 What about the huge GOP TaxCuts the Oil & Gas Companies received? They don’t require the State tax breaks anymore. The GOP Governance of even small states demonstrates their basic lack of humanity.

808 2018-03-07 22:14:55 Completely agree. As a long term student of Kenneth Waltz's work, the neorealist in me can't wait to see a supranational giant get crushed like the oil companies in the 1950s - they'll be begging for BEPS then if they survive it
809 2018-03-07 22:14:49 Okay, you can give people lead, mercury and pour oil over their head while chanting mantras to scam cancer sufferers or talk people out of vaccinations. Others are glad smallpox was wiped out and leprosy brought under control though.
810 2018-03-07 22:14:46 Dudes I took one big hit off of my uncles oil pen and I am stoned as SHIT either my tolerance has really Fuckin died or this is Strong ass oil
811 2018-03-07 22:14:45 It was obviously non-persistent. V-agents have a heavy oil base to slow their evaporation. Or do you know better?

817 2018-03-07 22:14:09 the human race is so fucked up that it spills oil on ducks and then creates a soap brand whos main selling point is that its the best at removing the oil from ducks
818 2018-03-07 22:14:05 @lolaknight201 is that oil coming out tonight?
819 2018-03-07 22:13:55 Holy crap this lentil stew is horrible. How tf am i going to go salt, oil and sugar free for a month? Maybe i can throw in some spices to make it hot... something. i need to salvage this i made 8 quarts...

837 2018-03-07 22:10:42 Agree. It is very hard for the consumer when this stuff is slipped into so many products without it even having to say 'Palm oil', or have any @NZneedsCoOL labelling.
It isn't actually that long ago when NZ farmers didn't even use this product. Now it seems to be the sacred cow
838 2018-03-07 22:10:28 Xom near lows of 2016 when oil was 30

I can’t hear the heart, this old oil stain
842 2018-03-07 22:10:11 Problem two: She used tinned oysters. Why do that? You're in a major city near a sea coast. I'm sure fresh oysters must be available. Tinned have that pungent odor that your cook noticed. They're soaked in oil, which isn't going to make the dish more agreeable.

850 2018-03-07 22:09:05 Chief! I hv heard dat d soot is a consequence of Kpo-fire which is illegal oil bunkering. D commonsense thing is to stop illegal bunkering.
851 2018-03-07 22:08:59 It's not quite a review since I'm not capable on judging such matter objectively. 

But I guess, the washing your face with oatmeal kinda work?

It's not like I suddenly has free oil face or turn into pretty or something

But it really do makes my face kinda smoother
852 2018-03-07 22:08:50 Good analysis, although I wouldn’t say this is entirely applicable to East Texas. 

That region had a whole host of industries, from oil/gas drilling to lumber and cotton. It was (and is) diverse enough to justify towns like Tyler, Marshall, and Longview.

858 2018-03-07 22:08:33 Looks like Ferrari’s engines evacuate way more oil vapour than other ones. You can even see it running on track. (Between the top of fog light and top of crash structure). Strange.
859 2018-03-07 22:08:24 Exactly. Oil & gas is Washington’s main business. Some say the US is a oil company with an army.

872 2018-03-07 22:06:52 I'm pretty sure wars over oil do ruin countries. The middle-east is a complete mess because of a century of conflict over their natural resources, as well as the aforementioned coups and funding of dictators. Countries that are now theocracies used to be more democratic.

880 2018-03-07 22:05:43 ...
Just out of curiosity, do you think this *wouldnt* have happened under socialism? Money is one thing but oil is a natural resource. Socialists would need it just as much as capitalists. Natural resources arn't economic, they're material. You cant fabricate them.
881 2018-03-07 22:05:39 /That's/ what we forgot, more cooking oil!
882 2018-03-07 22:05:30 So A Tumblr follow advertised for a cruise is January. Prices were excellent. It's a time of year where I NEED sunshine. And it was for nudists.

And then I found out that cigarette smoking is banned on the entire ship. The plumes of oil smoke the ship makes is perfectly safe.

I hope Nick isn't warning us of a pending Russian-backed US invasion by wild thrips bred in oil shafts! 
@nick_shl - please return to clarify your cryptic message - you may be our only hope
905 2018-03-07 22:02:14 Are you saying US/EU should be more exploitative, manipulative and destructive than they already are? Like engage in more bribery in Nigeria, spill more oil, and wire tap more elite's phone and commucations so as to use it to manipulate more, while kakistocracy proliferate?
906 2018-03-07 22:02:00 Is it a stealth oil tanker?
907 2018-03-07 22:01:49 That interventionism is a result of corporate interests. BP wanted Iranian oil, the Iranians democratically elected someone who wanted to disrupt BP's interests and as a result there was a coup. Which eventually led to a revolution where the US's guy was overthrown by a fanatic.

916 2018-03-07 22:01:07 Their intention has always been to destabilize Assad’s control, dividing the country up into potentially 4 parts (Sunni, Shite, Alawite, and Kurdish), therefore weakening any Syrian claim to the Golan heights and the oil and gas is then guaranteed to the open market.

927 2018-03-07 22:00:04 Well said Leonie!  More consistency on the whole processed/refined aspect would be nice as well.   As fruit is better than a sugary beverage, so too the olives & whole milk vs. oil, cream & butter.  In the end, the developed world needs to consume fewer cals, "healthy" or not!

932 2018-03-07 21:59:51 Coconut oil is an antibacterial and an antifungal. It can kill the good bacteria and fungi, whether or not it has its own pH.
933 2018-03-07 21:59:24 It’s also great for your skin too.. added a oil to help treat and prevent acne, remove dark spots and smooth stretch marks  it’s on the way

935 2018-03-07 21:59:18 I love coconut oil that's untreated. You can lick it, massage, and fuck with it. Triple threat.
936 2018-03-07 21:59:06 Even without it, its just egg yolks and oil. With heat they might split up and just add richness and moistness.

946 2018-03-07 21:57:00 What wars did they start to get that oil?
947 2018-03-07 21:56:50 The average person also enjoys low oil prices;  anything to portray #OPEC or oil bulls and/or equity traders is supporting evil.  In North America, Musk is the good guy & the oil companies are bad greedy dudes who steal money at the pumps.  That is the predominant narrative.
948 2018-03-07 21:56:47 Indonesia wants more of our crude oil for their energy sufficiency. Okay. Are we giving enough thought to our own energy sufficiency though?
949 2018-03-07 21:56:44 On the list is vegetable oil! So anything that lists vegetable oil as an ingredient it could be palm oil. The only way to confirm would be to contact the manufacturer and hope they give you accurate information. #PalmOil
950 2018-03-07 21:56:29 Tiny #Israel, even though it enjoys the protection of the #USA, has its own nuclear weapons & smart missiles but Iran, for all its massive population, long borders, oil and mineral wealth to protect, cannot have any?
It's such selfish, one-sided hypocrisy.
951 2018-03-07 21:56:20 Yeah! You are right about Agriculture. However, I believe the problem with Nigeria's Agricultural sector is not only poor investment but the fact that we want to do everything at once. We want to do rice,  yam,  oil palm,  livestock etc all at once, rather I think it will be...

953 2018-03-07 21:55:42 I counter with Venezuela, NOT because its a terrible country and an easy scapegoat people blame on socialism. But because they have the largest reserve of oil on Earth, and they're one of the poorest countries. It isnt American intervention for oil that destroys the countries.
954 2018-03-07 21:55:30 I have heard of this a lot! Good for getting makeup off? Do you rinse it or just leave it (the oil)? Might be worth checking out thanks so much

979 2018-03-07 21:53:18 Time for new life in Texas new faces Jeffrey Sachs: Houston is an oil town, so Texas politicians have long ignored climate truth and climate preparedness
Sachs: They have lied to their constituents for too long, expecting the rest of US to keep bailing them out. Harvey was fores
980 2018-03-07 21:53:08 I’ve noticed in the past that certain students are put in the same class that are oil & water.  How awesome would it be if admin & teachers would allow us help give some perspective when forming classes for the next year.  We might be a great untapped resource.
981 2018-03-07 21:53:05 I need to save money and all of a sudden my car needs an oil change and new brakes lolllllllll
982 2018-03-07 21:52:11 FACT: @GovMaryFallin & ilk have inexplicably ‘misplaced’ Oklahoma’s rainy day fund during a period of historic oil prices.

Dante’s Inferno reserved the 9th Circle of Hell for ‘Monsters of Fraud’... why don’t we?
983 2018-03-07 21:52:01 CLOVE oil
984 2018-03-07 21:51:58 Day 5 of dry shampoo. Put some Lavender and Tea Tree essential oil on my scalp to stop the itching. I am now a human essential oil diffuser.
985 2018-03-07 21:51:55 Russian Oil & Gas?
Japanese Whisky?
Alaskan Salmon?
I'm sure they'll be much cheaper than the alternatives next door.
This is Bare-Faced Propaganda.
986 2018-03-07 21:51:42 I have this feeling that things could get very interesting all of a sudden.
#ukog Beauty sleep required ....night all xx 
987 2018-03-07 21:51:40 Hey True American, explain what's so great about overthrowing foreign governments to secure their oil and why it's better than "stealing from people".

Come on, let's hear some of that "basic morality" of yours.
988 2018-03-07 21:51:35 I love the Bondi Sands line. They have a gradual tanning milk but the smell isn’t very pleasant. Their liquid gold dry oil is the best!
989 2018-03-07 21:51:35 Anybody using Cannabis Oil?
990 2018-03-07 21:51:16 Best article CBC has done in years! Truth is Russia  and the USA  have much too lose if Canada  gets its oil and LNG to shoreline!!! We must all fight this most important battle!
991 2018-03-07 21:51:14 Oh look, the magical “oil refinery shortage” money grab by the oil cartel. Thanks for buying it, news channels.
992 2018-03-07 21:51:04 maybe I am dramatizing unnecessarily since eggs and oil often go into cakes anyway
993 2018-03-07 21:50:59 If I followed all of Jiffy Lube's recommendations, an oil change would run me eleven thousand dollars.
994 2018-03-07 21:50:57 It depends on factors you fail to consider: 1) what price physical gold, in quantity, currently demands on the global markets; 2) what market participants such as Russia and Iran are willing to accept in exchange for their oil, based on their expectations of gold's future value.
995 2018-03-07 21:50:57 おはよー
996 2018-03-07 21:50:53 Basically have to spend all my life savings on oil changes for the VW, and they wonder why I'm 10,000 km over due. smh
997 2018-03-07 21:50:47 And No End to Texas Oil.
998 2018-03-07 21:50:41 THANK U........ i didnt like when i put coconut oil on it bc it feels greasy but @ night then washing before going anywhere can work...... thank u it’s so shitty ugh
999 2018-03-07 21:50:39 Obama destabilized Libya, jailed 0 bankers, increased drone strikes, oil, fracking, opened arctic for drilling, pushed TPP, expanded NSA spying, didnt legalize weed, gave SA & Israel Billions, remained in Iraq/Afghanistan, did coup in Honduras, etc we need someone better
1000 2018-03-07 21:50:28 The biggest oil companies all over Nigeria is Europe and America. Have you investigated the ammount of oil spills in Nigeria by those companies? Do you know the level of bribery going on from this companies to politicians in a place like Nigeria...you will shed tear my Dear.
1001 2018-03-07 21:50:28 Wasn't that around the time that Oil workers were told they couldn't talk about the new finds? I seem to remember workers saying they couldn't talk at the time.
1002 2018-03-07 21:50:21 I am home. £246 through the till, £137 via twitter. 
Cheese sandwiches for tea. Plus I found a jar of those fancy artichoke antipasto things in olive oil at the back of the cupboard, so i've scoffed half of them too.
1003 2018-03-07 21:50:19 I’ll be the guy that says purse carry is bad.  Having said that, my wife and I both carry the Smith and Wesson Shield.
1004 2018-03-07 21:50:19 And change the oil every 6000 km
1005 2018-03-07 21:50:13 Getting a decent coach and realising what a snake oil salesman Orta is where you need to start!
1006 2018-03-07 21:49:56 So if your so keen to give away a natural resource to the EU why stop at fish ? Let's give them rights to take the oil and gas as well ? The CFP has devastated coastal towns in the same way the mining communities suffered less fish aren't been caught but the EU has a larger share
1007 2018-03-07 21:49:47 I read it- no studies on vaginal use of coconut oil affecting ph and yeast infections, to me, means you shouldn’t be advocating for it as a sex toy lubricant. :/
1008 2018-03-07 21:49:36 Driving alone btu-miri midnight 
Driving hilux with 4wd engaged 
Waited a lifetime behind a stuck lorry in the mud 
Took a pee2 in the bush inside the oil palm field 

All happened in a week. #achievementunlocked #srr
1009 2018-03-07 21:49:26 It’s really good for your hair! Eggs and oil are both very good for hair. You can also make cake with it
1010 2018-03-07 21:49:24 Conclusion:  Shankar is a snake oil salesmen. A fraud.

1012 2018-03-07 21:49:15 Biomass is in red: Oil and Other.
1013 2018-03-07 21:49:12 I guess putting eggs and oil in your hair is probably pretty conditioning??? idk I just can't get over it
1014 2018-03-07 21:49:05 In Wakanda their is nothing like condom all the use was vibranium oil applied to the private part and nothing happens #BBNaija
1015 2018-03-07 21:48:57 Lol yeah for sure get an oil rig job
1016 2018-03-07 21:48:37 My mcm need to change my oil
1017 2018-03-07 21:48:27 There are certain commodities we must never be dependent on foreign countries for:
Steel
Oil
Aluminum
Uranium
Titanium
Gold/Silver
Brass....(if you get my drift)
1018 2018-03-07 21:48:26 I have pcos too! So I’ve lost a lot of hair but putting coconut oil at night helps also try amla oil that makes your hair grow fast and thick
1019 2018-03-07 21:48:25 how do people check their oil, get their tires rotated, go to the gym, read, go to school, do laundry, go to yoga, be in a frat, work, keep up with appointments, do homework, stay organized, sleep, have a social life, cook, clean, breathe I don’t even know
1020 2018-03-07 21:48:22 It's not a what if.  It's called economics. It's not a hard concept to grasp. Also oil drying up could happen anytime in the next  yrs.  Fact is we don't know how much is left. But that's an entirely different discussion.
1021 2018-03-07 21:48:16 Elliot, BC is in a trade war with AB. Canada’s Gay friendly Oil at tidewater displaces dictator oil from regimes that oppress . My buddy Khan is silent. Only JK is fighting for AB Gay friendly Oil. Your NDP are afraid of going to the front line to fight for AB and AB oil
1022 2018-03-07 21:48:04 but city would pay 160 mil just because they can. Oil money FC
1023 2018-03-07 21:47:55 Get an oil diffuser and diffuse lavender!! It’s a miracle worker.
1024 2018-03-07 21:47:53 Saudi Arabia should  opens doors of oil for UKGB
1025 2018-03-07 21:47:49 Surely a point of this, in theory, is to separate politically appointed minister (who will change many of his staff for new political appointees) and stable-ish technocrat cadre running INOC board.  Oil dev strategy  gets made/resourced  in technocratic setting. In theory.
1026 2018-03-07 21:47:47 What is wrong with Texas, oil rich, but obviously devoid of animal compassion! Shameful!
1027 2018-03-07 21:47:40 So oil prices per barrel are half the cost they used to be and gas prices (mysteriously) are near record highs, yet no one investigates, thanks! #OilCartel #GovernmentFail #NewsFail #MagicalOilRefineryIssues
1028 2018-03-07 21:47:27 Someone pls entertain me while i wait 2 hours for my car to get an oil change 
1029 2018-03-07 21:47:24 i fucking love my friends on this website like u talk about coconut oil as lube and they explain why its ok cause it has some magical oil chemistry shit that makes it absorb thru skin so u wont fuck up ur flora. yall some smart motherfuckers.
1030 2018-03-07 21:47:17 She's neglecting to understand most oil doesn't come from animals sources like lard aka animal fat. We can fry things too. Lmao. Oil is vegan friendly if it comes from a plant source. Who is this lady? 
1031 2018-03-07 21:47:05 Chef Louis cut up some worms, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was a dictionary, along with toast.
1032 2018-03-07 21:46:53 Oil money FC
1033 2018-03-07 21:46:36 Yup, dealio. I‘m on the folding rig. Just needs some oil and it’s good as new. Speaking of: How’s your uncle?
1034 2018-03-07 21:46:28 Oh yes, it's the scientists who are bought off, with their 40 thousand dollar government grants, not the oil and gas industry.

All the evidence points to climate change happening and it being man made. Denying it at this point makes you a science denier.
1035 2018-03-07 21:46:27 And all of the doomsayers that predicted oil was going to fall to less than $20/barrel, crawled back under their rock. 
1036 2018-03-07 21:46:22 Name the baby DERRICK!! After Texas Oil or NY baseball player - either way it’s a WINNER!! Derrick Carter Gains -
1037 2018-03-07 21:46:13 He he yup brings us back to conspiracy theories. Foreign oil giant's are the big manipulators of our democracy and culture. Will never be a fair fight  against that special interest  group, but  i wish environmentalists wld do more to help us fight them and take back our country.
1038 2018-03-07 21:46:11 dark chocolate’s aftertaste is what oil tastes like
1039 2018-03-07 21:46:00 #Oil   wow nice one #Excited
1040 2018-03-07 21:45:57 Hahahaha get that beard oil and pray
1041 2018-03-07 21:45:50 Same old response from @JustinTrudeau re AB's  #bitumen industry. As if huge amount of for oil subsidies can't be redirected to #cleanenergy industry. CA needs to get serious about #RenewableEnergy because it's 2018!
1042 2018-03-07 21:45:47 To my neighbors: sorry I smoked you out, i forgot to add a tiny bit of oil to my cast iron while making burgs :(
1043 2018-03-07 21:45:44 yes! Its super important to note that some vaginas do not handle coconut oil well at all, and that this is a risky little game to play.  Good for the pussies that arn't bothered but, mine would probably just fall right off.
1044 2018-03-07 21:45:28 Yeah this is why I want to cut the salt and oil.  Looking to reset my taste buds so I'll enjoy the taste of whole foods again without drowning them in processed crap.  Got a lentil and potato stew going in my instant pot.
1045 2018-03-07 21:45:23 Graphene is to physicists as coconut oil is to vegans. They both seem to have unlimited use and I don't care.
1046 2018-03-07 21:45:23 So I'm super lazy because even food processor was work  but coconut oil+coconut milk + garlic was key
1047 2018-03-07 21:45:13 I wasnt talking about oil. Im talking about iron and aluminum. We use way more than we produce annually. Not to mention that you need manganese to make steel, guess where we get that from? Not here.
1048 2018-03-07 21:45:09 Lol it’s okay it’s tucked away behind a oil change station. Across from chesterfield towne center
1049 2018-03-07 21:45:07 Well...they say it now because oil is scarce but they have a lot of gas.

Enviros are now working on how to reduce gas usage with heat pumps, batteries, wind, HVDC networks, solar PV, demand-response, etc. 
1050 2018-03-07 21:44:54 and the same WSJ mouthpiece for the GOP elites decries tariffs on steel & alum which is against national security STEEL is needed like oil
1051 2018-03-07 21:44:36 White women always complaining about perfume and strangers not helping you with your groceries on the subway but like can you help me out by staying your sick ass at home?! IS THERE A FUCKING ESSENTIAL OIL YOU COULD USE TO JUST FUCKING NOT?!
1052 2018-03-07 21:44:27 Thanks Ray. Great video! Looking forwards to using it in oil now. I'll let you know how I get on with it. Hopefully be Friday 
1053 2018-03-07 21:44:24 massaging ur head/hair with coconut oil helps alot i leave it in my hair overnight b4 i shower in the morning. it also helps to wash your hair with cold water instead of hot water

1055 2018-03-07 21:44:17 potatoes cooked well done with a side salad, no onions or fungus with oil and balsamic on the side, with extra dressing just incase they only put on a drip {blinks my eyes looking at you} what are you having?
1056 2018-03-07 21:44:12 Tobacco, Oil.....some of the best stuff on earth. #smh
1057 2018-03-07 21:44:01 And look at our gas prices higher then they need to be lets let's keep some of the oil for USA.
1058 2018-03-07 21:43:42 he can free meek mill, finish a cheesesteak without a drop of grease spilling, sing eagles fight song in 13 different languages (including Dothraki), climb poles doused in Crisco in record time with his hands coated in baby oil, can hit Santa with a snowball from 9000 yards away.
1059 2018-03-07 21:43:26 As a nurse And counselor I truly say that the biggest health issue is bad economic!. It leads to mental burdens. Like no income, no work, no meaning. Reduced health.  Oil snd gas pay for our saftynet so that we can fulfill our life together with the persons we care for
1060 2018-03-07 21:43:16 Seriously when will the Bush dynasty end. They are for oil and energy.

1064 2018-03-07 21:42:58 I read in a great book whose name I cannot recall, that these sprawls happened=cheap oil. The more oil increases, the harder it will be to survive in areas that produce primarily commutes.
1065 2018-03-07 21:42:57 I’m at this Nissan dealership getting my oil changed (I’ve been here far too long) and this guy I talked to on Tinder just walked in  why does this always happen to me?! It’s always when I look a mess or when I’m fed up and not in the mood to be social 
1066 2018-03-07 21:42:55 Why don't you please do some research yourself. 20-30 years ago every wacko on the left was saying we are at peak oil and we were going to run out it was all a lie then and it's all a lie now.
1067 2018-03-07 21:42:55 what kind of hot oil treatment do you use?
1068 2018-03-07 21:42:53 Somebody took my damn oil wipes!
1069 2018-03-07 21:42:51 in case you didn't know, eucalyptus oil can be incredibly toxic to cats

SO DON'T MARKET A PRODUCT CONTAINING IT AS SAFE TO USE ON CATS EVEN IF YOU THINK IT'S PROPERLY DILUTED
1070 2018-03-07 21:42:45 Why do some women act like if a nigga can change oil or a tire that validates him being a man... that way of thinking is so basic lol there's much more to life(men)than that
1071 2018-03-07 21:42:44 All BS you ARE an embarrassment to the Democratic Party. Just another snake oil salesmen imho. California is doomed with all you fake Dems. After 40 yrs I’m switching parties tired of this BS. 
1072 2018-03-07 21:42:40 Eucalyptus oil in the diffuser!
1073 2018-03-07 21:42:37 I have an AR-15 & have no dick whatsoever.  Her mindless femlogic breaks down right out of the gate.
1074 2018-03-07 21:42:36 As much as Trump has deterred things, Rouhani/Zarif have been kneecapped by regime elites. The arrests of foreign nationals combined with the hobbling of economic reforms and oil/gas contracts have really hurt their outreach efforts.
1075 2018-03-07 21:42:23 Akwa Ibom Facebook. From Day 1 - Day 365, dey analyze, dissect and discuss state politics like it's their daily manner. 

Every politician has his/her boys/girls that peddles story for them countering or saying something about another politician. 

Politics is our "oil money"
1076 2018-03-07 21:42:12 Ahem. Donning my environmental economics hat, it will be the increase in oil and other depletable resource prices that induce the switch to other modes of electrical generation.
1077 2018-03-07 21:42:12 See mayor Hoeven is an empty suit. He represents Corp farmers, oil/gas entities only. NOT THE WORKING PEOPLE OF ND.
1078 2018-03-07 21:42:08 Bottlers again. Not shocked. Get some oil geeza from Dubai in had enough
1079 2018-03-07 21:42:00 Flippy nvr gets sick, no payroll matching, no work comp, no family leave, NVR strikes, doesnt just not show up, require health ins. Good boy
1080 2018-03-07 21:41:56 Right now im burning through whats left of my morrocan oil before it expires but its pretty heavy on curls :( Trying to find something good for deep conditions; I typically just buy some packets of Keratin treatments or henna for treatments too!
1081 2018-03-07 21:41:53 Okay so does anyone know is there’s a place i could actually buy an essential oil diffuser for my car?!?? 
1082 2018-03-07 21:41:53 I’ve been using jojoba oil and shea but it always seems like the next day, my skin is more dry than ever /: and I don’t like coconut oil bc it doesn’t absorb into my skin that well
1083 2018-03-07 21:41:50 Back out real price gains in oil, then what are you left with?
1084 2018-03-07 21:41:47 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Los Angeles sleeps.
1085 2018-03-07 21:41:46 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Philadelphia sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
1086 2018-03-07 21:41:29 Do you ever use olive oil when cooking or just things like tallow, lard, and butter?
1087 2018-03-07 21:40:49 roughly 100g of butter and a decent splash of oil in the pan.
1088 2018-03-07 21:40:47 Fuck juve, taly olive oil drinkin bastards

1092 2018-03-07 21:40:31 US to start producing and exporting more oil. Expected to be the No 1 producer/exporter by 2023
1093 2018-03-07 21:40:24 ما افسده العالم يصلحه ال coconut oil 
1094 2018-03-07 21:40:21 I'm sure there's some kind of recompense. But for me it's the conflict of interest. Isn't he the foreign editor? How's he reporting the East Timorese negotiations re oil and gas rights. How'd he report the bugging scandal.
1095 2018-03-07 21:40:16 君を笑わせるためなら、僕は尻から油を出すよ。
1096 2018-03-07 21:40:13 I got coconut oil in my eye now I can't see WHY AM I SO WHITE help
1097 2018-03-07 21:40:11 Bring on that lawsuit from the Trump admin.  I could definitely use meaningless papers to clean the oil off my driveway.
1098 2018-03-07 21:40:08 I only changed the oil once on my Yardman w/ B+S engine. And by "change" I mean it was totally out of oil so I added the 16 oz or whatever it required :)
1099 2018-03-07 21:39:51 The powerful oil companies have a greenhouse where they're poisoning patriots. They want to hasten the return of the anti-christ.
1100 2018-03-07 21:39:43 This is not a thing to celebrate Nigerian Refineries and Nigerians should buy Nigerian Crude oil
1101 2018-03-07 21:39:40 every third full moon, when El Trumpo complains, more than one earthling cries for mama #resist
1102 2018-03-07 21:39:38 @JBPritzker is a racist who profits from oil pipelines that destroy the earth

1106 2018-03-07 21:38:29 Yes i'm biased but I only meant "believe as a starting point". With the abuse story I start from a believing position, with the snake oil position I start from a dis-believing position. 

Both are not my ends points.

1108 2018-03-07 21:38:06 At commercial tire getting an oil change. The View is on tv and there isn’t a remote to change it.

I can safely assume this show may be the sole reason for the pay gap. 

The combined IQ of this panel almost hits triple digits.
1109 2018-03-07 21:38:05 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.
1110 2018-03-07 21:38:04 Slightly ironic that. Maybe stop using that stuff. Soap, water, some cold cream is all you really need. Do not believe the hype and marketing behind that snake oil!
1111 2018-03-07 21:37:55 orangutans are my fav ape pls believe me.......i have an app on my phone that tells me if something has palm oil in it so i know not to buy it........

1114 2018-03-07 21:37:22 Jajoba oil, shea butter, coconut oil too if you dont mind slighlty oil skin the next day! (But oily is good).  My favorite is Shea Butter tho.. cause you have to work it in to melt it with ur body temp/friction, and so your skin really absorbs it..
1115 2018-03-07 21:37:18 Looks lovely, a little mozzarella, basil and a olive oil and balsamic dressing and that box wouldn’t last long

1121 2018-03-07 21:36:12 It was the texture of the egg filling. To me it was off somehow. Maybe oily isn't the right word, but I do believe the texture was due to the oil or whatever they used.
1122 2018-03-07 21:36:10 I’m seeing press that oil CEOs dismissed #ElectricVehicles at #CERAWeek2018. I heard a different message — that EVs are coming, but are not a silver bullet solution to #climatechange nor a death knell for oil demand.  I agree.
1123 2018-03-07 21:36:08 So far it hasn’t broke me out and it’s oil free so that’s good !!

1127 2018-03-07 21:35:25 No worries. Yeah the same bristle in all of the ultra range. I did use that brush in oil also, I painted a door with it and it was really good. I'll check if I have a vid.

1133 2018-03-07 21:34:28 They are a cult, promoting antiquated notions of masculinity and sex, hiding snake oil behind irrelevant pseudoscience. There’s a reason why the Ted Talk has a disclaimer on it. It’s all crappy science.
1134 2018-03-07 21:34:22 Felt like a skincare extrodinaire this evening. Double cleansed with oil first then gel, then used aha + bha peel treatment, followed by a super moisturising mask. Glowy skin, be mine!

1137 2018-03-07 21:33:54 Hybrid tech is reasonable. Stop/start is nothing more than a simple ECU reprogramming, higher quality oil and a beefy starter motor. Of all the things on my car to fail stop/start and the starter motor is my least concern (direct injectors is #1)

1142 2018-03-07 21:33:31 Adulting and getting my oil changed today 
1143 2018-03-07 21:33:25 Yes. I did a lot of research and found that money, like oil, it part of the evolutionary process of a civilization that eventually has to be faded out or else it will cause more harm than good. It helped when we were more primitive but we have outgrown it.

1259 2018-03-07 21:19:27 The studies conclude that #lavender oil resulted in significantly better sleep and relief from anxiety.  In one study, there was a pronounced antidepressant effect and improved mental health and quality of life. #MindBodyThoughts

1261 2018-03-07 21:19:15 For the #scientists #geologists among us: Beyond the predictable oil spills, doesn't disturbing the ocean floor with #CoastalDrilling off BC, OR, WA, & CA - the #CascadiaSubductionZone - make these highly volatile earthquake fault zones even more unstable? #NoDrilling

1264 2018-03-07 21:19:01 Rolled back restrictions that should have never been there in the first place, if it means drilling for oil in Yellowstone I'm for it as long as we're energy independent from other countries. Talk to Obama about human rights, the only rights he cared about were muslims
1265 2018-03-07 21:19:01 Bio oil? It’s pretty expensive but I think my mum used to use it on her c-section scar.
1266 2018-03-07 21:18:55 Work kicked my butt and now I’m having to wait for an oil change. Oh happy day. 
1267 2018-03-07 21:18:48 1/2 How about some REAL reasons for building the Kinder Morgan pipeline:

1. Existing Pipelines carrying crude oil are at capacity yet demand continues to rise. 

2 Oil by rail has increased exponentially to address the demand for oil.
1268 2018-03-07 21:18:43 I just done making my oil paint, does anyone want to see it?
1269 2018-03-07 21:18:40 Oh, looking too profitable for the yoon agenda was it? Poor Scotland, that ghastly, worthless oil everywhere.  It’s just funny that when that oil pipe cracked the U.K. balance of payments went all, um, shit. Desperate spin borrowing journalism’s coat.

1271 2018-03-07 21:18:07 It seems like Israel is becoming another former Soviet fascist arms trafficking state but without oil. Israel needs trade to survive. Israel could become a pariah state & a failed state.
1272 2018-03-07 21:17:54 £5 Billion is nothing rob. the tories give £7 billion in subsidies to the oil and gas industry annually and the total give away is £85b. we will take the lot back from the hollyweird industry of hypocritical celebs controlled by perverted Billionaires.
1273 2018-03-07 21:17:53 Um, oven for 12 mins? Drizzle it with some olive oil, sprinkle some garlic, salt, pepper and seasoning on it, mix it all up, then oven at 220 for like 12 mins

1278 2018-03-07 21:16:58 California, Texas and New York are the 3 highest GDP generating and greatest economies in the United States. However Texas money tends to remain with the Oil families while California and New York generate revenues for the rest of the Union. Funny how that works out

1283 2018-03-07 21:16:32 @realDonaldTrump was busy running into the WTC saving everyone on 9/11... I could be wrong  but maybe...

It was very informative. Also thanks for paying our bill at the bar . @AnotherRoundUg @nbstv
1293 2018-03-07 21:13:41 Donald Trump is inherently garbage. From the union workers he’s fleeced in Atlantic City, to the workers he’s paid below scale in New York. He says anything , like a snake oil salesmen to hook and bait you; facts reveal just how crooked he is!
1294 2018-03-07 21:13:40 Dig a hole put a seed in and wait.  not complicated either but pioneers seem to be celebrated even through the destruction they have cause to this country is peanuts compare to oil and gas industry

1297 2018-03-07 21:13:14 And yeah $60 is steep for an oil change but it depends what you get a lot of cars need specific oil like full synthetic/high mileage oil is more expensive plus if you need a lot of it it can be more. I spend about $40 and that’s for a 4 cylinder car w 240k miles lol
1298 2018-03-07 21:13:06 There's a lot of loose reporting in Canada regarding oil. Journalists always focus on Alberta's economy & never on BC's. When has there ever been in-depth MSM expose on the industries that lose big time should there be an oil spill here & consequences to public health?
1299 2018-03-07 21:12:57 Get the oil and spit ready 
1300 2018-03-07 21:12:54 Thought that was Dems goal?

1319 2018-03-07 21:10:02 I am extremely saddened to hear this.  I looked up to and admired Suzanne as a motivational powerhouse in the oil and gas industry. RIP
1320 2018-03-07 21:10:02 I know, right? What are these foolhardy countries planning to do? Light their lamps with whale oil alone?
1321 2018-03-07 21:09:52 At jiffy lube for an oil change and they tryna tell@me I need new rear brakes but my car is front wheel drive and that do 75% of my stopping and I changed my own brakes last year 
1322 2018-03-07 21:09:51 Exactly.  A few months ago oil was at $40 a barrel.  The complaint was that the Saudi's would not reduce production, so "experts" predicted U.S. producers would fold.  What happened?  The U.S. INCREASED production,and now oil is $60.  Heck, we are even EXPORTING it!
1323 2018-03-07 21:09:50 Nigerian economy still vulnerable, IMF has warned.

The International Monetary Fund said Nigeria was coming out of recession, however “lower oil prices, tighter external market conditions, heightened security issues,” remain  downside risks for the country.
1324 2018-03-07 21:09:46 It was beyond imagination for these experienced and knowledgeable politicians to believe they found a spring of diesel. They failed to do just a little research on diesel. Diesel has additives and is not crude oil for heavens sake. Their leadership was compromised.
1325 2018-03-07 21:09:41 The coal industry said it was the easiest way to increase energy supply (touching demand not allowed). About 400 coal plants had shifted to gas or oil by 74; after, the shift was in the other direction, locking in a huge number of coal plants just as climate worries grew clearer.
1326 2018-03-07 21:09:35 Yea i’m changing my oil for now on,m. Caught a mechanic putting cheaper oil than what I asked for in my vehicle.

1328 2018-03-07 21:09:33 The UT GOP logic: lets spend money on naming a highway after Trump, who has no ties to this state aside from signing an executive order that gives fed land to oil drilling....and sorry, we’ve run out of funding for our schools. #utpol #utleg #utgop

1339 2018-03-07 21:07:49 Just natural coconut oil! It feels so nice and actually won't leave you greasy like I thought, just gotta put a small amount 
1340 2018-03-07 21:07:46 Right.  But we have tons more natural resources than Norway - even per capita.  One reason they developed the sovereign wealth fund is because they don't actually have a ton of oil, so they looked at near future of running out of oil.
1341 2018-03-07 21:07:40 Nearly everything is made with cooked in nut oil, so be careful x
1342 2018-03-07 21:07:39 just got some white guy who's really excited about oil and drilling sliding in my DM's - wondering when the dick pic is coming so i can send it to his employer.

1344 2018-03-07 21:07:05 You also may find it it interesting that China, Singapore and Hong Kong (all in top 9) are creating their sovereign wealth funds based on their economic performance and not because they have oil under ground.

1352 2018-03-07 21:05:47 A good story on Total E&P's Patrick Pouyanne, a man who's not afraid of risks. Just before Christmas in 2015, he met Museveni in Jinja at a time Kenya was assured of hosting the East African crude oil pipeline. Pouyanne convinced Museveni to divert it to Tanzania. Only Pouyanne.

1355 2018-03-07 21:05:17 By "Rebuild" our parks I assume you mean drill for oil, and dig for minerals, and ruin them?

1365 2018-03-07 21:04:07 I thought that too but there might be oil or natural gas. It would be an un-natural disaster I guess. I noticed Olivia just mentioned Fracking which is controversial. It explains the sewer backups, tremors, +. Some countries have banned it. Not a reg earthquake.
1366 2018-03-07 21:03:58 It vents the oily air from the crankcase, rather than allow them into the airbox like before (an oil burn trick). Exiting by the exhaust should reduce the oil deposited on the following car

1373 2018-03-07 21:02:56 $40 is pretty normal for a standard oil change !! A lot of times you can find coupons for like jiffy lube
1374 2018-03-07 21:02:46 That extra £12m a season is pocket change to a club of near unlimited oil wealth, the wages of ONE City player. 

A real fan doesn't want their club to bankrupt itself by spending for spending's sake. Klopp's football is a rare and beautiful thing: just enjoy it FFS.
1375 2018-03-07 21:02:24 Yes of course the future.  The future also doesn’t have us continuing new oil sands.  The future will also be without Bakken and EF producing as they do now.  OPEC has said many time will need new forms of complement energy.  Media seems to ignore and spin it.

1383 2018-03-07 21:01:03 If #Trump includes these (outrageous) Steel & Aluminum #Tariffs on Canada , then I believe we should reciprocate by raising the export tax on #Oil to the U.S.!

1389 2018-03-07 21:00:31 RT DawnRedden2: In Indiana, as of today, the Sunday prohibition on sales of carry out alcohol is over.

We still cannot have medical cannabis. Oh, and all CBD oil is outlawed...even hemp derived.
1390 2018-03-07 21:00:20 Yes hot oil vapour
1391 2018-03-07 21:00:18 @theresa_may cares more about oil & arms (that the Saudi's use against the people of Yeman) then she does about human rights
1392 2018-03-07 21:00:17 Apply jojoba oil for 20 minutes before going to the shower. This promotes fast hair growth!
1393 2018-03-07 21:00:04 Now who’s the loon?  How were you elected?
1394 2018-03-07 21:00:03 Today's rollercoaster brought to you by car ownership:

- Oil change at 11AM
- Check engine light goes on just before it
- Call from dealership: It's gonna cost over $1K 
- Second call: Covered by warranty () but can't fix til tomorrow 
- We have no loaner cars available 
1395 2018-03-07 20:59:46 Idk if I ever will. Imma just get jojoba oil
1396 2018-03-07 20:59:45 With the amount of senators that are on oil companies payroll we are already
1397 2018-03-07 20:59:35 Tea tree oil
1398 2018-03-07 20:59:19 I do however like taking *krill oil* not fish oils, because the taste/burping factor has me gagging
1399 2018-03-07 20:59:09 There's one by our house we go to all the time. Two sodas, two cannoli, and a bottle of olive oil and they're like "that'll be $75." 

Which I happily pay, because cannoli.
1400 2018-03-07 20:58:45 Rofsnet or Rosfnet is why, perhaps. Putin's $600 million dollars he paid Rexxon Tillerson for oil is still stuck in the ground in Ukraine.

1405 2018-03-07 20:58:07 Peak oil ¿otra vez?
Parece una cordillera con tantos peaks.
1406 2018-03-07 20:58:04 Seriously. A whole supermarket box full of sugar. Half spoon, as well, so technically double. And three vats of vegetable oil. Came to £118+
1407 2018-03-07 20:57:59 I buy it pre-cut and frozen. Sauté in a frypan with some oil and it a little bit crispy. With garlic would probably be great if you like garlic.
1408 2018-03-07 20:57:39 So as trump don't know the  story only heard part something like that raising
Putting taxes on steel yes that is something to think about cause USA import alot and the oil you using is no dam good you should wait first before any move which oil is a part of we have new ways
1409 2018-03-07 20:57:33 Of course... I had biotin but shampoo, or oil. I take like 10 heavy ( prescribed heavy meds) every day. That is why I said please, if you do I video.. do not forget US! I said like 3 times.
1410 2018-03-07 20:57:26 BOTH of our two viable parties legislate in the interest of the military industrial complex, big oil, pharma industry, telecom industry, etc. etc. You’re incredibly naive for supporting this system. Your party’s just not that into you.

1412 2018-03-07 20:57:15 Time to start refining our own oil as well. Let Canadians benefit from their own resources! If any complaints from U.S...... its Trumps way!!
1413 2018-03-07 20:56:59 I got accused of taking Poppers by someone in M+S at Castlepoint last week because I was having a hit off some Obas Oil.
1414 2018-03-07 20:56:45 Just saw a guy buy INSANE amounts of sugar, jam, salt, baby powder and vegetable oil. Is he running a bakery or cooking crystal meth?
1415 2018-03-07 20:56:40 Overnight results with @Guerlain Abeille Royale Youth Watery Oil. I am hydrated and my blemishes look lighter and are less pronounced. Wow!!!
1416 2018-03-07 20:56:31 I'm R&D in renewables and even that plug will fast become obsolete. Maybe no yet, but soon, possibly even soon enough. 

oil is obsolete
1417 2018-03-07 20:56:28 I am (as well as my family and numerous friends) are prepared to stand with California and fight ANY offshore oil drilling off our coast! NO OFFSHORE OIL DRILLING! PERIOD!!
1418 2018-03-07 20:56:26 Shouldn’t the market be asking how oil inventories were only up 2.6mm including SPR for the week when imports were up 720k/day w/w?.. demand for oil in the US is very strong right now for this time of the year. #OOTT
1419 2018-03-07 20:56:22 Original or Tobacco, which @industriesgroom beard oil do you prefer?
1420 2018-03-07 20:56:15 What's ironic is that the Saudi's are preparing themselves for a post-petroleum world.  As their own oil minister said a few years, "The stone age didn't end because they ran out of stones, and the age of oil will not end because we run out of oil."
1421 2018-03-07 20:56:11 So what if other countries have oil to produce? We should still be promoting and selling our own. Trudeau said years ago he was going to phase out the oil sands. By not getting involved in the AB/BC dispute, he is sounding the death knell for Canadian oil.
1422 2018-03-07 20:56:09 “Higher oil prices are supporting the near-term projections, but medium-term projections indicate that growth would remain relatively flat, with continuing declines in per capita real GDP under unchanged policies.” | IMF on Nigeria
1423 2018-03-07 20:55:48 An oil and gas test south of St. Johns flowed water at the rate of 700 gallons per minute (24,000 barrels per day) from a sand in the Permian Supai. Therefore, the Permian Supaihas the potential for prolific production rates from the sands, as well as the vugulardolomites.
1424 2018-03-07 20:55:38 I regret making those 2 trips home last month. Now I gotta pay for this high ass oil change earlier than I intended
1425 2018-03-07 20:55:24 We keep complaining of the govt but Nigerians are terrible
We hail everyone irrespective of their source of wealth
All the otedolas of d bribe scandal to those they dashed oil well

And those who hustle legit we scoff at them
1426 2018-03-07 20:55:00 Trying to help my bio teacher by finding the density of some diesel but the nozzle wasn't on all the way or something so I poured it all over my hand.... I washed it enough that I think I got all the oil off. I hope
1427 2018-03-07 20:54:52 It would appear that "Dr Steve" is a lobbyist for Palm Oil. An oil that congeals at room temperature is a cardiologist's nightmare! Also, he advises you to use a healthy oil like Flaxseed oil with caution - quite hilarious! Like I said, either a lobbyist or not a real doctor.
1428 2018-03-07 20:54:47 USA is no. 9 in the world with 151 billion sovereign wealth fund. Probably getting higher now when US is becoming the biggest oil producer in the world.
1429 2018-03-07 20:54:47 Gorgeous now,pretty soon it will be effed by more development and oil ventures
1430 2018-03-07 20:54:40 I can't believe I used to put coconut oil on my face. 
1431 2018-03-07 20:54:10 Unless we produce more oil than OPEC, this tweet means nothing...also, Russia’s oil is nationalized..is ours?

1435 2018-03-07 20:53:42 Soaring demand is the main reason for the rebound in oil prices -- but if the economy falters, crude could tumble back to $40 a barrel, according to Exxon Mobil Corp
1436 2018-03-07 20:53:24 I would wager it isn't Doris. It is more probable that it is foreign oil interests that are increasing market share as we are not moving forward. Look at market share increase for the US for the last 10 years during the shale boom. Play chess more. Things aren't simple like L&R
1437 2018-03-07 20:53:23 Where y’all go for y’all oil changes ? Other than wal mart ...

1447 2018-03-07 20:52:30 Our government is just wasteful in all sectors and maybe because we have free money coming from oil
1448 2018-03-07 20:52:21 Trudeau's response was an embarrassment to Albertans! Nye's position on our natural resources was well known! Why was he invited and paid by our tax dollars Kent? On the other hand Trudeau's views on the Oil sands are well documented as well...sad for Alberta Kent.
1449 2018-03-07 20:52:21 1. Why was the tomato red?

1458 2018-03-07 20:50:57 I'm a pro-trade Canadian and I'm ready to #KillNAFTA. Tired of giving the US preferential access to our oil and gas and I'd rather we pursue deals with partners who actually WANT to trade with us. 

We can do better. Sorry.
1459 2018-03-07 20:50:53 On a second thought I know what their plan is, they plan to make port harcourt uninhabitable some they can turn it into a large oil field. People living in PH are prone to asthma, lung cancer and other respiratory problems. #Stopthesoot

1463 2018-03-07 20:50:43 this doesn't make the case. There is more evidence Iran Assad Russia been facilitating AQ/ISIS. Russia even got sanctioned for buying ISIS oil.
1464 2018-03-07 20:50:11 Got home took my makeup of, ate a tub of coconut oil, ate some butt, straightened my hair, took 3 tabs of acid, won 3 rounds of just dance, planted my carrot seeds, This year is looking good!

1467 2018-03-07 20:50:02 Tillerson has spent the money on drilling for oil. Isn’t that obvious? It’s sort of what happens when you put a deranged psychopath in the WH and he appoints his rich friends to positions of power so they can all become wealthier.
1468 2018-03-07 20:50:01 Ok big boys banks etc in oil world it was said it's best to come this way

1472 2018-03-07 20:49:53 Obama imposed economic sanctions; killed the Exxon/Rosneft North Sea Oil deal! He ejected 35 Russian spies! He closed up and seized two of Russia's compounds in the US. That is NOT "nothing"! Get your facts straight.

The Dems are just diet version Republicans who care about women and gays. Both support corporate welfare, endless war, Big Pharma, money in politics, and Big Oil.
1488 2018-03-07 20:47:12 Boulton, Watt & Murdoch established the Gas industry. Gas lighting reduced demand for whale oil, made homes & factories safer by replacing sooty candles & lamps, which had caused many fires. By-product coke replaced coal & wood reducing smogs & air pollution. Some +ve’s & -ve’s.
1489 2018-03-07 20:47:12 I recommend bathe it in olive oil, add salt and pepper, then drop that hunk on a hot grill fired by oak.   I love vegetables but.......
1490 2018-03-07 20:47:10 Hi Norman, thanks for weighing in. The problem I see is that U.S. funders r selective about where they try to #keepitintheground 

They take a sledge hammer to Alberta but they don’t touch Texas. They hardly touch any of the U.S. states that account for >90% of U.S. oil prod’n.
1491 2018-03-07 20:47:06 Lmaoo be literally bathing in coconut oil but want us to believe it’s just, natural. Stop lol
1492 2018-03-07 20:47:05 The sea tides aren't the only tide rising. "This land is OUR land"... from Cali to NY. BTW who stole the oil rights from bears ears?
1493 2018-03-07 20:46:57 But his point isn't right. I mean, if it's just "there was a lot of coal and oil and gas still in the ground," sure. But most people didn't disagree at the time (except the Hubberts peak folks).
1494 2018-03-07 20:46:35 I think industries have evolved to shift/consume a by-product. Fact is no palm oil = no PKE. Reverse not the case. I am phasing it out of our operation b/c it makes sense here, not because it will save any trees or primates.
1495 2018-03-07 20:46:25 The oil sector is fr the who is who in government so don't say any benefits to the local population already the fields are owned privately
1496 2018-03-07 20:46:19 He sat on the board of Energy Transfer  Partners (Dakota Pipeline) and has investments in gas and oil. He’s thinking of his back pocket. Green energy is out of the question while this guy is around.
1497 2018-03-07 20:46:17 I think it’s fair to expect us to be moderate in our use of a feed that has milk quality and environmental concerns. However it’s galling to have it constantly rammed down our throats by consumers who make no attempt to moderate their palm oil use

1518 2018-03-07 20:44:40 Is $40 expensive for an oil change ? I feel like I’ve NEVER paid this much for one before
1519 2018-03-07 20:44:36 Nick’s jelly that the 5 minute oil guy was flirting with me. He’s so cute when he’s jelly 
1520 2018-03-07 20:44:33 Put some oil in her tea...she’ll be floating and it doesn’t even taste like anything. Trust me....why you think we had so much tea in the house

1524 2018-03-07 20:43:44 Only I stand up for Alberta.  I will ban all oil sales to BC, boycott the canucks. I will build a big wall, a great wall the biggest the world as ever seen.  I will take away Christmas.  I will turn a weather dominator lose on Victoria.  Nothing is too crazy for UCP.

1528 2018-03-07 20:43:22 I’ll sell you my Saab don’t won’t break down if you keep adding oil ever 2 months 
1529 2018-03-07 20:43:20 Very little guidance, I'm guessing and as far as accountability goes, I suspect everyone involved knows these are big gambles. For the KSA, priority #1 is reducing their massive exposure to oil a.s.a.p. / they're semi-desperate players willing to bet big with few strings attached

1536 2018-03-07 20:42:40 Please who knows someone that sells cold pressed organic Jojoba oil?? I'm in dire need of it!!
1537 2018-03-07 20:42:34 Yep, the NRA is not extreme at all. Neither are the oil companies, or private prisons. Come on...this is silly.

1540 2018-03-07 20:42:18 first oil change by myself done 
1541 2018-03-07 20:42:11 So are they doing the hidden billion-dollar government subsidy to private oil companies like Boundary Dam was?
1542 2018-03-07 20:42:10 More people are employed in healthy environments than in oil & gas industry.  The United States needs clean energy and industrial regulations protecting environment to keep a good economy and healthy communities.
1543 2018-03-07 20:41:57 Fossil..... Billions of barrels of oil way down below the surface is a giant liquid dinosaur grave? Please....
1544 2018-03-07 20:41:46 The squeaky wheel gets the oil unfortunately. Older women are much less likely to kick off and cause the government trouble. As a result they will not be pandered to, unlike other groups.
1545 2018-03-07 20:41:42 If we moved a lot more oil to USA and West Coast by PIPE instead of rail, there'd be more room on those long trains for grain cars
1546 2018-03-07 20:41:41 Slap him with some holy oil . No way
1547 2018-03-07 20:41:39 "COMES NOW the Applicant" -- I am enjoying, in a twisted way, the blizzard of paperwork from an Oklahoma law firm representing a company wanting approval from the Corporation Commission of the state (like there's a chance they'll say no??) for a multiunit horizontal oil well.
1548 2018-03-07 20:41:33 mine’s turkey, tomato, a nice vinegar/oil drizzle, fresh slices of bacon, a little bit of lettuce, maybe some extras here and there as well
1549 2018-03-07 20:41:32 Yesss I use jojoba oil and it's great, I'm just noticing my eyebrows and eyelashes are starting to get better. I also try to use castor oil on my eyelashes at night with a clean mascara wand/spoolie
1550 2018-03-07 20:41:26 We have started to drill our own oil and as you can see the Russian economy has been struggling. The rest of the world needs the USA more than we need them.
1551 2018-03-07 20:41:24 So the plot of Donkey Kong Country is to get DK's banana hoard back from the Kremlings right? Naw, them fools were using that as a cover up scheme. They were really there to drill on DK's island. Why else is there an oil field level?  King K. Rool is an oil tycoon.
1552 2018-03-07 20:41:11 He's not wrong though Kevin. Neither are you. Either we need to find a more ethical supplier of oil, or do without nice things.

1559 2018-03-07 20:40:01 Big corps will always sacrifice ethics to make $$$. Palm Oil is grown in Guatemala by REPSA for Nestle. They pollute, bribe, even murder.

1564 2018-03-07 20:39:31 i've also recently been using castor oil on my lashes at nights and i feel like it's helped them grow + has made them stronger! i just bought 100% pure organic castor oil and some disposable mascara wands off amazon :) (i can send you links if you want)

1567 2018-03-07 20:39:06 They done had my car for 4 hours just to change the oil 
1568 2018-03-07 20:39:03 You pretended to be someone else. The Bush family let the binLaden family fly out after 9/11.  It was the only plane allowed to fly out. Their oil business had troubles & they turned to the Saudis. He ACTED like a “nice guy “ it WAS an act. He is part of NWO swamp

Actually true, just not very nice.

1584 2018-03-07 20:36:54 On today's show, Idaho has my complete and undivided f'n attention for their anti-democratic Senate shenanigans to try to shield Gov. Masculine Sea Mammal from being forced to cast a 2nd veto on a popular bipartisan bill to allow epileptic kids to use non-psychoactive CBD oil.
1585 2018-03-07 20:36:53 That's because it's sinking into a lake of burning oil.

They literally have nowhere to go and nor should they, everyone who worked there, or continues to, has no place in society. Ever.

1589 2018-03-07 20:36:24 There is not a day goes by that something I thought was “true” is contradicted e.g. heating olive oil. When you find out something you believed to be true is not #changeyourmind also #stopbrexit

1594 2018-03-07 20:36:06 Get your bath water super hot then put a few drops of peppermint oil in it. Soak and breathe it all in for a while :)
1595 2018-03-07 20:35:58 YUP-The OB & Ricky comments about setting absolute rate limits [Ana/21cts, Ricky/20 cts] without any allowance for fuel costs, are just plain moronic; like they have zero understanding/knowledge that in the last 8 years, oil has been between $26/barrel [2016] & $126/barrel [2011]
1596 2018-03-07 20:35:57 cut em up however u want, season, add some green onion, tiny bit of oil and I put the top on & let it do its thing
1597 2018-03-07 20:35:27 So they’ll just cave to threats even though they have their own oil and gas?

1605 2018-03-07 20:34:43 ACTUALLY you want to know who is oppressive? The IRAQI government is oppressive towards it people.. One of the most oil rich countries in the world and the politicians are too corrupt to provide electricity,water, healthcare, and proper schooling to its citizens.

1608 2018-03-07 20:34:19 Australia is unlikely to use its gas explicitly: a) to reduce CO2 emissions ie replace coal or complement intermittent renewables b) as an alternative transport fuel to reduce its oil dependency. No matter how "smart" the negotiations were conducted the project itself is doubtful

1613 2018-03-07 20:33:59 Untrue to say cutting off foreign $ for environmental campaigns wouldn't change the scale of public opposition to @TransMtn. Public opposition to the oil sands and pipelines likely would not even exist if the enviro movement hadn’t decided around 2008 to start manufacturing it.

1619 2018-03-07 20:32:41 Govt could always do everything better so they took over agriculture and oil and now they don't produce much of either despite a year round growing season and one of the largest oil supplies in the world.

1628 2018-03-07 20:32:01 I don't see what her personal life has to do with her political philosophy. When she became governor of Alaska, Exxon, BP and Chevron had monopolized the entire oil industry in Alaska. She busted up that entire arrangement. It really impressed me that she took on the oil industry
1629 2018-03-07 20:32:00 Yes! Borehole back in service, though we’ll give it a couple of days to flush through before we start drinking the water again. Still no boiler as neither plumber nor oil are present :(. Hurray for disco lights! Himself worries our (distant) neigbours will think we’re a grow-op!
1630 2018-03-07 20:31:57 Pretty hilarious to hear Dan defend oil companies and inject a political view into a discussion about gouging.

1635 2018-03-07 20:31:25 If you'd read my post you initially commented on instead of doing a search-and-reply for every Moser mention, you'd know Fletcher's not my candidate either. And just in case you didn't know since you're in San Francisco and not Houston, the oil & gas industry isn't a slur here.
1636 2018-03-07 20:31:09 Why did you give this oil shill a full segment to push pipelines with his flawed insolent logic?

1641 2018-03-07 20:30:39 none of this will matter in a few years... oil is a dying commodity, but markets will take a few years to wake up to this eventuality. Oil producers needed to take diversification steps yesterday.

(might be stating the obvious here)
1646 2018-03-07 20:29:43 Bust out the baby oil shit going to get real
1647 2018-03-07 20:29:40 Approximately 47%of our debt is owned by China, Japan ,Belgium and the Caribbean banking islands. Oh and Oil exporters, let’s not forget about them. Who is left for US to subsidize?
1648 2018-03-07 20:29:40 I found that using rosehip oil on my cuticles has made my nails grow strong crazy quick
1649 2018-03-07 20:29:34 miss when one hit off the oil got me lit. now it takes like ten lol
1650 2018-03-07 20:29:00 Check your #plants for scale and if necessary scrub with mineral oil (white oil) on a cool day
1651 2018-03-07 20:28:56 @InfluensterVox the foundation is sweat and oil free #FitMeDewy
1652 2018-03-07 20:28:56 はやおき。
1653 2018-03-07 20:28:42 Go work in the oil field--you'll make it in less than a year.
1654 2018-03-07 20:28:41 おはやぅ
1655 2018-03-07 20:28:37 tbh today is going pretty well cos i didnt start it off by burning myself with hot oil n almost starting a kitchen fire AND the sun is almost out.
1656 2018-03-07 20:28:33 Oil fields, pipe line is hiring
1657 2018-03-07 20:28:29 The man lost a load of hours due to an oil leak fire. Sky please don’t stir things up so bloomin early

1659 2018-03-07 20:28:24 The potential for hydrocarbons and industrial gases in the Holbrook basin is considered good to very good. Evidence includes past production of helium, recent discovery of carbon dioxide, shows of oil and gas in numerous wells,
1660 2018-03-07 20:28:18 Why is it that it's only the elite that get these sweet oil deals in this country?  #AnotherRoundUg
1661 2018-03-07 20:28:02 Coconut oil is major key
1662 2018-03-07 20:27:56 What’s better than using #autogas, a clean fuel, to save money and reduce dependence on foreign oil? The fact that we make it easy and affordable. #worktrucks18 #drivetheconversation #cleanairclearmind
1663 2018-03-07 20:27:49 Coconut oil 
1664 2018-03-07 20:27:49 When youre on the phone talking about drugs and your mum walks in.. lawl  

Whatever context it was is irrelevant . Anointing oil will be bought.
1665 2018-03-07 20:27:42 Oil will eventually run out, what do you think will happen to them then?
1666 2018-03-07 20:27:37 Baby oil is another one to avoid!
1667 2018-03-07 20:27:36 It would be Alberta's and Saskatchewan's oil industry because nobody else gives a shit about it.
1668 2018-03-07 20:27:34 Hope those mortgages on all those skyscrapers have been paid off before you run out of oil and are relegated to primitive mud huts.
1669 2018-03-07 20:27:15 Govt is gonna have $2bn!!! I need to get into the oil sector
1670 2018-03-07 20:27:10 None of this is a direct subsidy.  Oil companies pay billions in taxes every year.  Solar and wind companies get billions of direct subsidies every year.
1671 2018-03-07 20:27:02 Said all day a think spurs will win pochetinno football is brilliant doesn't spend huge amounts like the other clubs. I hope they win don't mind a club that isn't run by oil and money winning
1672 2018-03-07 20:27:02 This was the SNP's argument for years ("It's our oil!").

Cash transfers - even ones 10x as big as the UK's into the EU - are not the major issue with unions.

Unions aren't about shuffling a fixed .X% of your GDP back and forth - they're about safeguarding GDP growth.
1673 2018-03-07 20:26:24 The cut grass oil smells lush. 
1674 2018-03-07 20:26:15 How do Ugandans take a piece of the 15 billion that’s being invested into this oil #AnotherRoundUg @nbstv

1676 2018-03-07 20:26:07 Let's not go there brother. Governors from oil rich regions collect over a billion monthly on security vote which they don't account for it. The greatest problem of this country is just docility of we youth. Elsewhere, this story could have spark of protest but, not in Nigeria
1677 2018-03-07 20:26:02 WATER, CORN SYRUP AND 2% OR LESS OF EACH OF THE FOLLOWING: CONCENTRATED JUICES (ORANGE, TANGERINE, APPLE, LIME, GRAPEFRUIT, PEAR), CITRIC ACID, ASCORBIC ACID (VITAMIN C), THIAMIN HYDROCHLORIDE (VITAMIN B1), NATURAL FLAVORS, MODIFIED CORNSTARCH, CANOLA OIL, SODIUM, etc...
1678 2018-03-07 20:25:33 Ahh that s the oil cooler 
1679 2018-03-07 20:25:01 @DFBbear @O_Rich_ So the US is paying terrorists to keep up the regime change plans & to steal Syrian oil resources!
1680 2018-03-07 20:24:52 if u moisturize with an oil instead of a lotion ur eyebrows and eyelashes get thicker and longer I know bc I did it on accident
1681 2018-03-07 20:24:51 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.
1682 2018-03-07 20:24:43 #WhenINeedAHero it's  Turkey and Provolone with olive oil and vinegar peppers. When I need an Italian hero it's @gianluigibuffon
1683 2018-03-07 20:24:19 Our national parks were supposed to be our most beautiful, untouched places in our country. Protected by law, by us all. What is happening to our country?? Desicrating it for uranium and oil. Criminals.
1684 2018-03-07 20:24:18 Lead them from temptation make them royalty, All the things we're facing makes us question it.
Lead us to salvation, pour that oil please. That's how we become kings and queens .
1685 2018-03-07 20:24:13 Well.. Let's be blind to the social aspect. New oil no new oil. Nigerians are of a foolish mentality. sorry to say
1686 2018-03-07 20:24:05 Snake oil saleman.
1687 2018-03-07 20:24:04 Also, globally, the subsides oil and gas gets are concentrated in mostly oil producing countries (like my own country and the country that I live in). I am the first to call for their removal. They do more good than harm.
1688 2018-03-07 20:23:58 Pro Oil Bush admin created   anti  trucking statutes ?
1689 2018-03-07 20:23:55 Bob gets most of his facts on wikipedia, Fox media, or Breitbart. His arguments lack research or citation OR anything that goes against his very limited understanding of the Old Testament Bible.  He sells snake oil conservative rhetoric and will never vote country over party.
1690 2018-03-07 20:23:45 Barely, but when I do I just make sure to use wipes + coco oil to remove before rinsing my face off then apply a face mask + moisturizer after
1691 2018-03-07 20:23:29 Remember that haste always makes waste, whether it be immediate or delayed, waste is inescapable. An ember may glow for hours whereas a gallon of oil would be consumed in mere minutes, if not seconds.
1692 2018-03-07 20:23:22 I haven't done it with coconut oil but I have KetoBomb powder and KetoFeed protein with MCTs and electrolytes that I mix in and that is definitely helpful - and delicious!
1693 2018-03-07 20:23:19 just fried up with sesame oil and an egg and green onions and too many freakin spices! very simple today in terms of ingredients but technique-wise everything went perfectly :')

1696 2018-03-07 20:22:34 The tweet doesnae tie in with the content, naw? Where does he offer firm support to the snake oil salesman?
1697 2018-03-07 20:22:31 I love the smell of coconut oil 
1698 2018-03-07 20:22:22 Operative word,”COULD “. But your donors & big oil, “WILL” benefit! Let’s see who finances you when you run again!
1699 2018-03-07 20:22:19 Nigerians see technology as the "new oil" something that killed the country. Again, we don't have patience and technology don't work without patience. We are in the talking and "noise" phase of technology.. the "new slay queen" in town, that everyone wanna toast.
1700 2018-03-07 20:22:04 The oil in Generac pressure washer should be changed after every 20 hours of usage. RT to spread this #MaintenanceTip
1701 2018-03-07 20:21:56 @SteeleAndUngar  if you have a segment tonight about the tariffs think on this. Domestic oil and gas production uses a lot of steel and aluminium. If the break even price/barrel goes up jobs in these struggling industries go down
1702 2018-03-07 20:21:55 Have to take time off for silly things like furniture delivery and oil changes
1703 2018-03-07 20:21:50 #natgas is starting to worry me here.

Summer contracts above 200 day moving average & oil in my view won't hold $60 next week. 

The storm in east coast should have bid #natgas much higher by now.
1704 2018-03-07 20:21:49 @GhPoliceService, Any rapid response team ?

Libia has the oil and Nigeria but have poor infrastructure
1706 2018-03-07 20:21:40 Sorry, I meant rose-hip tea.  I use the rose-hip shells, which you can collect in Autumn and dry, and add them to other herbal tea mixes.  The oil is good too, taken internally, but can be expensive!
1707 2018-03-07 20:21:36 "I just want to cover her in olive oil and smack her ass"
1708 2018-03-07 20:21:32 Much, much, much larger subsidies with oil & gas industry, but at company levels, so you don't get to hear them.
1709 2018-03-07 20:21:21 Emu, castor, sesame oil. Mix, rub in, apply moist heat. Incredible!
1710 2018-03-07 20:21:14 I love coconut oil as lube and I love sex dreams. That is all.
1711 2018-03-07 20:21:14 apaz primrose oil is very good !
1712 2018-03-07 20:21:13 Came to get an oil change ended up needing new air filters & break pads 
1713 2018-03-07 20:21:01 Message from the Mauldin event -- I was part of the 'cute bear panel' with Louis Gave and Grant Williams. These 'bears' were actual bulls on Japan and India. Grant likes gold and Gave likes oil. Some 'bear panel'!
1714 2018-03-07 20:20:52 Flipping advertising. FYI Baby oil DOES NOT taste like babies. False advertising!
1715 2018-03-07 20:20:49 You cut ya hair too much fool you gotta wolf it for 4 to 8 weeks and I use coconut oil and this Cantu pomade bruh shit lovely
1716 2018-03-07 20:20:49 There are a clear set of how to count principles that are understood by most children before the age of 5. No need for snake oil that just lines the pockets of those who purvey it.
1717 2018-03-07 20:20:34 It Looks like an oil company logo
1718 2018-03-07 20:20:33 Please do.  I'll have one of my people make you an oil pointing of it

1720 2018-03-07 20:19:52 actually no. please do some due diligence and research who owns Genie Oil and the tech related to oil industry Israel wants to sell. israel needs the oil itself as it is now upgraded by IMF 
1721 2018-03-07 20:19:47 Just issue a damn warrant and quit messing around with toothless detainers. Shouldn't take more than 5 min
1722 2018-03-07 20:19:37 One time I got an oil change with Barbra in the CD player and it was taken out of the player when I got back into the car l o l
1723 2018-03-07 20:19:33 He tenido la oportunidad de acercarme, a nivel básico, al sector de transporte maritimo (LNG, crude oil, dry bulk, etc). Me parece un sector muy complicado y sobretodo poco invertible; especialment por ser tan cíclico y capital intensivo (ROICs bajos).
1724 2018-03-07 20:19:28 Perhaps the government should subsidize four-wheel scooters for seniors and the disabled since less and less can afford to drive a car anymore. If it's not the price of insurance it's the cost of gas  

They subsidize the oil industry so why not?

1729 2018-03-07 20:18:47 It has little to do with how long it takes. Refiners must believe they can make money over the 30 years of their multi-billion $ investment & that the supply of tight oil will last that long.
1730 2018-03-07 20:18:47 Short of oil perhaps?
1731 2018-03-07 20:18:40 My sister dropped her coconut oil in the mop water and now she’s crying LMFAOOO
1732 2018-03-07 20:18:38 Uhh if my cbd oil doesnt get here before photo i might j snap
1733 2018-03-07 20:18:28 Heh AP. Assign someone to look into Tillerson's literally lethal duplicity in African oil dealings as Exxon head. Disgusting.
1734 2018-03-07 20:18:17 Let me guess you took your wife? I took my wife to the dealership to get her oil changed and drove off the lot with a new car for her. I don’t take my wife to dealerships any more.
1735 2018-03-07 20:18:03 It might have had something to do with the oil shock but that wouldn' t suit your argument would it?
1736 2018-03-07 20:18:00 A lose wheel nut, then a clip that burns wiring, electrical issues and an oil leak.these are the sort of things a team of Mclaren's stature should be above.  Wouldn't happen in Jo Ramirez's day.

1738 2018-03-07 20:17:59 Oil and vinegar make for a great salad dressing.
1739 2018-03-07 20:17:45 I feel like EVERYTIME I need an oil change they always find something like, “Miss. Hunter you need a new..” man BYE can you just top off the oil?
1740 2018-03-07 20:17:33 Finally get a tax break however, Louisiana people still suffering effects of obama regulations along with our liberal Governor opening doors to lawyers to sue the oil industry. And trying to increase sales tax for the 2nd time so there goes our tax credit! Heartbreaking to move!

1742 2018-03-07 20:17:23 Should I remind "The Con Man" aka  gets most of the United States "BLOOD" from red states like North Dakota, Pennsylvania & Texas??

You know, oil!!

Without oil, California's economy would wither away like Texas Tumbleweeds.

1743 2018-03-07 20:17:12 @billnyefilm Good to see you are still connecting to children-like Justin Trudeau.
But please keep your fairy tales about Alberta Oil and climate change to yourself. Do some research when dealing with adult subjects. GOOGLE can be your friend.

1747 2018-03-07 20:16:49 California desperately needs the oil before it leaves the Union. Mexifornia or Califexico will need its own oil. Otherwise, they won’t be able to afford the energy transfer tax the 49 states will need for the Western Wall.

1750 2018-03-07 20:16:23 TV preachers are snake oil salesmen.

The formula is use Jesus as your product to collect money from the people to "help" others. Keep 3/4 of the money & continue to build your brand. Build everything big with better lies & homes, until the public catches on. Plus, it's tax free!
1751 2018-03-07 20:16:17 There is a distinction.

A unicorn and working snake oil have never been found, victims are real, nobody doubts that.

1759 2018-03-07 20:15:26 Jacking up the prices three days before a mass peaceful protest against Trans Mountain pipeline project seems more like manipulative nefarious price rigging than true market conditions. I expect nothing less from the oil and gas sector. #StopKinderMorgan

1762 2018-03-07 20:15:13 Not quite. The figures I've seen is Saudi Arabia is No 1, Russia No 2, US No 3. But you are correct, America produces their oil at a cheaper cost and is less reliant on Saudi oil than it has been in the past

1787 2018-03-07 20:12:34 you mean to sell our resources to the world? To get a better price for our oil? What are you smoking
1788 2018-03-07 20:12:23 Do you even call yourself a parent if your toddler aint stop crying unless you let 'im drink a cooking oil.

1794 2018-03-07 20:11:38 @DLoesch thanks for the like! Keep doing what you are doing! We pray for you and support you 100% will you follow me back?Thanks! Also, I am a fine art oil painter, would love to paint one of your pets for you as a thank you for what you do! God Bless you and the people at NRA!!
1795 2018-03-07 20:11:33 Texas has 1/3 of all the US oil, followed by N. Dakota, and a very cheap technology to extract called horizontal drilling. Offshore drilling is a very expensive way to drill & not economically feasible. Let the red states who consistently vote for it drill. Californians vote no.

1802 2018-03-07 20:10:48 If u wanna gain a few pounds, just drive by Pizza Hut. They let the dough sit in oil for like over 24 hrs. Just sniffing the air will give u an extra belly roll
1803 2018-03-07 20:10:45 If you actually read independent news giving details from on-site and history, them being bad people was 90% propaganda. The US had motives involving oil, minerals, money and power. No way did that justify murdering hundreds of thousands of innocent people to save them.
1804 2018-03-07 20:10:43 The LT crude oil price forecast in the 2009 MKJA analysis for Pembina/Suzuki & the NRTEE report = $50/bbl. (The price had crashed to $35 in December 2007.) No one was modelling based on a $100 barrel, let alone $200, in 2009. So "2010" in that report is comparable to 2020 today.

1807 2018-03-07 20:10:18 Well, to be fair, we also use a LOT of petrochemicals in fertilizers, drugs, and pesticides. But even a 2% reduction in gasoline use could cause MAJOR headaches for oil companies.

1820 2018-03-07 20:08:45 These people are selling snake oil... and most likely their true desired destination is a no deal catastrophe. No-one with half a brain could honestly attempt to draw close parallels.
1821 2018-03-07 20:08:42 They had modern economies mining gold, drilling for oil and the like? Or was it all still in the ground? Why didn’t they use these resources that made the west rich to conquer the west. They weren’t peaceful.

1825 2018-03-07 20:08:15 We now pay at the pump what we did when the price of oil was at it's record high. Someone is making a killing.

1830 2018-03-07 20:07:14 Maybe its because they all went to the same public school Vince? Or maybe because they buy all of our guns and bombs? Or because that's where we get our oil from? Just a few thoughts....

1924 2018-03-07 19:58:10 Mom finally got me Aloe Vera and Coconut Oil after acting Up 
1925 2018-03-07 19:58:02 Grape seed oil contains vitamin e, that’s why it works well & it doesn’t clog pores(:
1926 2018-03-07 19:57:37 Me too.. Crude oil is down more than 2%
1927 2018-03-07 19:57:30 We must not relay on oil, we must change the economy. This is one of things we must get right - @HMKemiAdeosun on #NgTheCore With @KadariaAhmed on @channelstv
1928 2018-03-07 19:57:18 So good! Been using the tea Tree Oil & face wash for years & recently started trying out a bunch of their newer products.
1929 2018-03-07 19:57:15 The guys at the oil change place always show me my oil thing when they’re done like I know what the hell im looking at lololol
1930 2018-03-07 19:57:02 Waiting on an oil change and the jackass next me has his phone set to make a click with every touch. Just when I thought the douche wearing his sunglasses was annoying.
1931 2018-03-07 19:56:59 All my buddies old dry oil wells start producing again after they sit for a few decades,the bio signatures were wrong. its picked up on its way up,There is new science to back it up also, Im from Texas I know all about oil, what the Oil guys are saying is the same.
1932 2018-03-07 19:56:46 Cut the flow of oil through Kinder Morgan now. Bring BC to its knees in a matter of days. #TransMountain #bcpoli #ableg
1933 2018-03-07 19:56:33 Just spent six harrowing hours syringing gallon after gallon of whale oil into my own urethra!
1934 2018-03-07 19:56:16 You owe me a new monitor, ya bastid !! LOL
1935 2018-03-07 19:56:05 I’ve had a couple of people say cod liver oil .... Lola gets stiff and sometimes yelps when she gets up after being asleep for a while thinking it’s her joints
1936 2018-03-07 19:55:59 I’m not a fan of the coconut oil part, it makes my mouth feel weird lol. Have you tried butter coffee??
1937 2018-03-07 19:55:56 Our fresh water resources are worth more that this oil!
1938 2018-03-07 19:55:48 What is this oil.. I need that breeze in my head..
1939 2018-03-07 19:55:45 What about big oil including US companies funding the likes of Vivian Krause?
1940 2018-03-07 19:55:34 Wholewheat pasta in olive oil, with sun dried tomatoes and feta, topped with a small sprinkling of chopped basil 
1941 2018-03-07 19:55:30 Your serum is my skin saviour this winter! I mix it with a drop of rose hip oil :)
1942 2018-03-07 19:55:27 What would happen if we had zero steel production? Here’s a hint: what happened when we were highly dependent on foreign oil? It’s not about jobs; it’s about national security and economic security. The jobs are incidental as are collateral impacts to the economy.
1943 2018-03-07 19:55:11 I have ordered some yumove for Lola but you’re the second one to mention cod liver oil ... she gets stiff and then yelps when she gets up sometimes poor lass 
1944 2018-03-07 19:55:02 Tanning oil/lotion suggestions?
1945 2018-03-07 19:55:01 And I think there's a lot of  hard work on It, but for me, It's more interesting animate from 0 than how Rotoscopia works. I liked the film but it's not that much just because all the frames are painted in oil.
1946 2018-03-07 19:54:56 So I suppose the gov't would also be happy to sell weapons to ISIS if they had enough cash. Just goes to show how they have completely lost their moral compass when they put money and oil above lives.
1947 2018-03-07 19:54:50 Have you read where the oil was coming from I can’t seem to find anything, and the reason for the PU change
1948 2018-03-07 19:54:49 ok who gonna teach me for free and pay for the oil :)
1949 2018-03-07 19:54:43 Coconut oil, deep conditioning, and patience
1950 2018-03-07 19:54:39 For the garlic confit I use olive oil. It will produce both the confit and after a really nice garlic oil.
1951 2018-03-07 19:53:51 Bruh I’m never going to get an oil change by myself ever again
1952 2018-03-07 19:53:32 I used cod liver oil caps for Buster...worked a treat!

1953 2018-03-07 19:53:14 I’m home and have my sacral nerve Stim in/on.

Now that I’m part robot everyone can call me Ultron. I’m only eating nuts (pun intended) and drinking oil. That’s how this works now, right?
1954 2018-03-07 19:53:08 chANGE UR OIL URSELF AND SAVE MONEYYYYY
1955 2018-03-07 19:52:57 I learnt about clove oil from watching Marathon Man and the "is it safe" scenes. Good stuff and a super-scary movie scene.
1956 2018-03-07 19:52:57 An oil service firm in Lekki is urgently recruiting for the role of: 
1. A female accountant with a minimum of 5 years experience. Candidate must have a good know of payables and receivable, budgeting, cost controlling. 
ACA, ACC certified would be an added advantage.
1957 2018-03-07 19:52:57 Ever since I started putting castor oil and coconut oil in my daughters hair, it’s been growing like crazy!
1958 2018-03-07 19:52:53 In 2014, Nigeria was ranked 136. Now Nigeria is 148. Do the maths.  Other countries have improved but Nigeria has fallen 12 whopping places. This is not about price of oil, this is a reality check of corrupt malpractices that they campaigned they will change. Where is the change?
1959 2018-03-07 19:52:28 I support developing alternative fuel. I do not support Exxon's efforts to expand oil drilling.
1960 2018-03-07 19:52:21 @BeavertownBeer have you changed the recipe for Neck Oil? Just got some of the new cans (orange lids) and it tastes a bit different
1961 2018-03-07 19:52:16 Its a good thing Norway uses oil, something we have an infinite amount of, to fund its "socialism"
1962 2018-03-07 19:52:10 Why?  So all the politicians can make money while turning a blind eye to any irresponsible or unethical, possibly illegal actions done by said oil companies.
1963 2018-03-07 19:52:00 Israel and the Saudis are quietly aligning on issues of common cause, mostly related to Iran. Palestinian’s are losing stature as a client as the oil states see little progress and tremendous corruption. Recognition that Israel is a stabilizing force, containing Syrian disaster.
1964 2018-03-07 19:51:47 I want to paint my hydro flask but all these people who have no idea how paint works are out here doing it with oil + paints that will chip/ decolor within 2 washes and I’m not trying to fuck up my 40 dollar bottle
1965 2018-03-07 19:51:42 Yes we have used it for old princess & also ourselves..it’s of benefit if you take for a long period of time.kaiser is on turmeric paste & Cod liver oil tablets for his arthritis-lot cheaper
1966 2018-03-07 19:51:40 Got my cleaning done today, oil change and windshield wipers feeling so accomplished
1967 2018-03-07 19:51:35 Yes. And fry bread is NOT a native Native American food. It was created of necessity when the US government dropped off sacks of flour and drums of vegetable oil....
1968 2018-03-07 19:51:30 It is an impressive beard. What products do you use? Oil? Balm?
1969 2018-03-07 19:51:28 オリーブ油は、毎朝やっているテレビ番組のコーナーでも使っていたりするよね♪
1970 2018-03-07 19:51:18 yeah I'll find one, but basically cut the top off an orange, scoop it out. Get a packet brownie mix, they generally just need an egg and some oil. Make up the mix, fill the oranges, pop their little lids back on ...wrap in foil and onto the coals for 30mins!  #CampingWithKids
1971 2018-03-07 19:51:13 يا جدعان انا اكتشفت احلي استخدام لل coconut oil بعيداً بقي عن كل الهري دا انا بقيت بستخدمه اني اعرف البس ايه لقيته جامد اتقل لقيه سايح بلبس صيفي و الموضوع مثمر جدا يعني

1973 2018-03-07 19:51:02 It appears folks haven’t twigged why a Trump visit is frowned upon yet this bearded tit is taken for tea with the Queen.. I’ll enlighten you with why our Govt are licking his blowhole... OIL and a big fuck off arms deal... Wake up you mongs.  #SaudiCrownPrince
1974 2018-03-07 19:50:51 I hate baking chicken breast I prefer it cooked with olive oil
1975 2018-03-07 19:50:49 When I bought my new car the salesman told me I’d have free oil changes whenever I come in...call in to schedule one and they acted like I was stupid Good sale bruh
1976 2018-03-07 19:50:49 bit of fun ....all in the name of scientific research
1977 2018-03-07 19:50:42 Tell the truth, who cooked that?
mmmm....string beans....garlic lightly heated in oil, then marinated with garlic, oil, and bit of Red wine vinegar for a good bite to it........like how Nonna used to make it.
1978 2018-03-07 19:50:36 Lol as if we aren’t raising children who are pro 2A, who will then raise their children to be pro 2A, etc etc. @deans0114 
1979 2018-03-07 19:50:26 Could be. The Deloitte report showed only $1.25bn of forward oil sales were utilised. But reports in Feb 17 suggested figure was was $3bn. So I am guessing that $1.75 went to pay the banks.  

Again why? its a lot of money and it was not crucial to settle like with IOC's.
1980 2018-03-07 19:50:17 .Polonium #Putin in 3 steps: 1.Freeze all Russian assets in US. 2. Go Green & tank Rus mono-economy based on OIL. 3.Launch USA Cyber Manhattan Project & hack Russia back to Stone Age.
1981 2018-03-07 19:50:15 It’s the $$$$. And he gets plenty personally from the oil companies. But Texas as a state  also gets $26 million a day in revenues. Their gravy train and low tax claims would be shot to hell if they don’t get the oil money.
1982 2018-03-07 19:50:11 Random question. I have just acquired some old woodworking planes and want to restore them.I assume I just use some wire wool and some linseed oil to treat the wood? #cornwallhour
1983 2018-03-07 19:50:05 That @GaffMondo fella still peddling chromatic snake oil, eh? 
1984 2018-03-07 19:50:00 I’m over due for a late night cruise session like I am this oil change @MainetheCK need to get to it soon bro

1989 2018-03-07 19:48:59 Steel is a global commodity with a world wide price (similar to oil) so you can't be surgical.  If we block steel from China they just sell it to, say, France and then France says us their steel at the lower world price.  So tariff have to apply to all or won't work.
1990 2018-03-07 19:48:43 I took a big ass hit of oil and I think I almost died
1991 2018-03-07 19:48:32 พูดหรอ?? นึกว่าเห่า
1992 2018-03-07 19:48:21 Don't you have the oil?
1993 2018-03-07 19:48:04 Coconut oil honey & avocado
1994 2018-03-07 19:47:59 Lying down in my office, listening to the Doors. 

I really should oil the hinges...
1995 2018-03-07 19:47:58 What about invading other countries ? These insurgencies are not because of ISIS it's for oil. ISIS is supported by the USA and Israel Saudi Arabia. We know what is going on.
1996 2018-03-07 19:47:49 For the courageous, you can SELL an April crude oil 64 call for 12 to 13 cents and SELL the 58 put for 13 to 14 cents.  Call it 25 cents or $250.00, expiring in 8 days which includes the weekend.  So, 5 trading days after today.  Margin should be less than $2,500 to make 10%.
1997 2018-03-07 19:47:48 Just ate so much grilled broccoli and expensive olive oil that I feel like switching back to Greggs pasties for the rest of my life
1998 2018-03-07 19:47:40 She could change the oil without lifting the car.
1999 2018-03-07 19:47:30 My dad is just like this! He like beard oil and every two weeks he reminds me its time for me to cut his hair
2000 2018-03-07 19:47:29 How organic can coconut oil get 
2001 2018-03-07 19:47:17 Well, I mean, subsidizing steel would be dumb too. But I guess it would be less dumb than tariffs. 

Subsidies to oil are bad policy as well.
2002 2018-03-07 19:47:08 It just needs a oil change and the tires rotated. Everything is ok with my child 
2003 2018-03-07 19:47:06 Ugh, I forgot to mention the fact that EVs can make us permanently energy independent by eliminating our oil addiction. 

We can power EVs with onshore wind, biomass, geothermal, hydropower, nuclear, solar PV, tidal power, concentrated solar power, offshore wind, OTEC, etc!
2004 2018-03-07 19:46:39 Need a good facial moisturizer for combination skin (not oil). Any suggestions?

2007 2018-03-07 19:46:22 Keep oils where you use them! I tend to forget to use my Fitness oil before working out.

2008 2018-03-07 19:46:16 LOL.  Who did they beat to get to that game again?  Every time, they played them in that game?  Without snake oil salesmen? And convicted cheaters?  #thedynastyisover.  Now you are just a great town with a great marathon again...

2013 2018-03-07 19:45:06 @DecaturBeerFest hello! We'd love to support and feature our beard oil at your festival. Decatur loves a good beer and a great beard! Can we sign up to sponsor?
2014 2018-03-07 19:44:59 Think I might start a series where I just tell stories on why I smoke, nothing extremes just little stories like today. I’ve been trying to get my oil changed and tires rotated since 8...it’s almost 2 and I’m still not out of here... I’ll save the feast for later lol
2015 2018-03-07 19:44:36 I miss the old days when Dr Drew was considered a legitimate, respectable doctor. Now he's a snake oil salesman who shills for other snake oil salesmen. SAD.

2022 2018-03-07 19:44:04 Oil is part of a lot of every day life in more ways then one.
2023 2018-03-07 19:44:04 Plenty of water, sleep and i also found my oil diffuser helped my sinuses as well! Hope it helps @chloe_trautman

2025 2018-03-07 19:43:53 Did they just have acid at the ready in the old days?  Like next to the olive oil?  I hope he made the mistake and grabbed the acid for his spaghetti and that's how he left the earth
2026 2018-03-07 19:43:49 Ordered it yesterday. I’ve heard so many good things about CBD oil. Can’t wait to use it on my dog.

2033 2018-03-07 19:42:42 I was actually colored spray for your hair, which I bought at a arts and crafts store :) The beard was super dry tho after washing it out, but some beard oil solved that pretty quick :) Thank you
2034 2018-03-07 19:42:34 Not at all.  The last thing they want is any discourse with you, me or anyone not in lockstep.  She could easily be in ISIS.  ideologue
2035 2018-03-07 19:42:27 Crude oil has dumped today and I see some pile up in products.  The warm February saw a slower draw down in heating oil and I believe refineries are moving to more gasoline ahead of the summer.  It's an interesting dynamic.  Trump's energy policy is not reflected in pricing yet.
2036 2018-03-07 19:41:58 Wait, wait, you are against corporate welfare, the funded by special interest right wing heritage foundation? You guys who push for billions in corporate welfare to oil/gas & Wall Street, you guys are against corporate welfare. I can imagine you laughed after writing that article

2042 2018-03-07 19:41:18 @WarmliteUK why do the instructions for the the oil filled radiator I've just bought say don't use it overnight? What if that's when it's cold? 
2043 2018-03-07 19:41:08 But they are semi-criminal regime of arch-capitalists and oligarchs in search of a regime raison d’etre hence nonsense theories like Eurasianism. The govt at crooks riding a nationalist tiger of oil and gas money and piss and wind. Celt later is nuclear. And bio as we know...

2052 2018-03-07 19:40:24  Its been very hard. He's an illiterate, self mad man, been working in oil since 1956. The oil crash drove him to a suicide attempt. He's a good good man.
2053 2018-03-07 19:40:20 I remember reading autopsy reports on Inuit in the early 1900s whose plaque resembled that of smokers.  I guess there might be issues involved in spending 10 months out of year for 70 years huddled in a small ice house burning seal oil all day every day.

2060 2018-03-07 19:39:43 GTFO here Whole Foods 365 

your hummus doesn't even contain olive oil 

you are dead to me
2061 2018-03-07 19:39:42 They get the oil if they have an agreement in place!  

Use the uranium example, prices are $21/lb, but producers have agreements with utilities to sell uranium for $90/lb. These agreements will eventually expire and be renegotiated but until then its +$69 or 4.5x spot
2062 2018-03-07 19:39:41 Olive oil on toast. Squeeze juice from a tomato and it’s seeds on that. Then avacado on top with a dab of salt
2063 2018-03-07 19:39:35 Need to get a good resource set up. Knowledge is power. Keep working Richard, it isn't easy but it is so valuable. #ShopLocal #wearewithyou
2064 2018-03-07 19:39:24 Tomato sauce for homemade pizzas is one of the all-time easiest DIY projects. It's made with just a few ingredients — canned tomatoes, garlic, balsamic vinegar, and a drizzle of olive oil — and a quick blitz in the blender or food processor. You can even freeze it in single …
2065 2018-03-07 19:39:20 Hey, attack the AR all you want....but leave Bubba's garage out of this. He's a good man and keeps a sanitary environment.

2067 2018-03-07 19:39:07 Cruz reminds my of the snake oil salesman in “the Outlaw Josey Wales”.
2068 2018-03-07 19:39:02 No. Vitamins and holistic supplements aren't regulated by the FDA either. Again only drug compounds are. So if you put a cerimide, vitamin c, and vitamin b oil in it your fine. If you put salicylic acid then you need the FDA. Even vitamin supplements aren't regulated.
2069 2018-03-07 19:38:55 The Founding Fathers never asked for Oil Portrait ID & only used paper ballots for voting and counting the vote which automatically provided recount ability.  It's not a bad system.
2070 2018-03-07 19:38:51 Introverts represent!  Lavender is amazing, I use the essential oil for calming.
2071 2018-03-07 19:38:49 Boy gtfo here
2072 2018-03-07 19:38:36 Throw some ghee and MCT oil in that coffee and now it’s a meal. 
2073 2018-03-07 19:38:32 Are you still banging this drum? Put up a statue to a woman who was responsible for the destruction of huge areas of employment, putting 1000,s of people out of work,whilst at the same time stealing all the oil revenue for tax cuts and the rebuilding of London. Are you joking?
2074 2018-03-07 19:38:29 Coconut oil and witch hazel nothing else
2075 2018-03-07 19:38:19 Just had olive oil drops in my ear  #ugh #pain #feelingsorryformyself
2076 2018-03-07 19:38:15  get beard oil
2077 2018-03-07 19:37:45 You can make so many sauces with a mayo base!

Add seasoning to make a great sweet or savoury dip:
olive oil + spices - (=aioli)
pureed garlic - fries
honey and dill - fries, chicken fingers
lemon, relish, garlic, onion powder, vinegar - (=tartar sauce) for battered fish!
2078 2018-03-07 19:37:39 Lavender oil works well
2079 2018-03-07 19:37:37 I hope peoples has more sense than the media, because it seems to forget that natural gas and local oil will lower the green house gases by more than 30%. How´s it possible for journalists to lawfully only write cons?,based on false information, as well. Seems like con-democracy.
2080 2018-03-07 19:37:32 I've been very, very wrong about productivity in #oil drilling. My losses are minimal because I'm at the back of the oil curve (DEC 2021), but I'm now lost in the trade. I still expect inflation to kick up, but production costs are now a different animal altogether. #OOTT
2081 2018-03-07 19:37:30 There are also alot more rural jobs in the oil,gas and coal industry. From drillers to electricians, we need a balance not a ban.
2082 2018-03-07 19:37:26 so lizzy, why did you decide to put your olive oil in the freezer?? why are you this way??

2084 2018-03-07 19:37:23 Just good pasta with a drizzle of ev olive oil is one of my favourites.
2085 2018-03-07 19:37:23 With independence, we'd be negotiating with the same resources but wouldn't be splitting the benefits unevenly with the rUK!
It would be *impossible* for an indy Scotland to come off worse in any trade negotiations, when it has 96% of UK Oil, over 60% of UK fish etc...
2086 2018-03-07 19:37:22 My dad and I are watching videos for different recipes and this lady goes “grape seed oil” after that we changed it Bc it’s too fancy for us 
2087 2018-03-07 19:36:48 In part. We're $22 Trillion in Debt and this Admin is scrambling (Forget US Treasuries) to pay back in part those Debts by selling off to Foreign Nations & Corps our US assets: Oil/Coal/Natural Gas/Real Estate/Stocks/US World Influence-Picking our carcass clean/And they get a cut
2088 2018-03-07 19:36:45 Of course that pic does look nasty - oil should be emulsified.
2089 2018-03-07 19:36:19 i can already feel my stress about work tonight... i hate when we have to change oil with a PASSION
2090 2018-03-07 19:36:19 Oil
2091 2018-03-07 19:36:08 The US already subsidizes the hell out of the oil, to make it more affordable for motorists. Why not the steel industry
2092 2018-03-07 19:36:05 To soften your hands, rub your hands with warm olive oil, leave it on for 5-7 minutes, and rinse off with warm water.
2093 2018-03-07 19:35:48 I live in CO and this surprises me not at all. The oil and gas industry is tremendously powerful here. Like the NRA, they seem to fight tooth and nail to prevent anything that might infringe on their "rights" while reducing regulations wherever they can.
2094 2018-03-07 19:35:43 Is there an ancient culture whose (highly suspect) health practices haven't been marketed to credulous white women yet? Can I start a Viking Medicine trend? I would like to be a rich snake oil saleswoman.
2095 2018-03-07 19:35:41 @WoodMackenzie @JavierBlas2 :Why do American oilers  constantly try 2 up the oil anti? it's a zero sum game folks, more oil equals low prices ;how is that praiseworthy ?
2096 2018-03-07 19:35:36 I like the dr. Bronners tea tree soap it’s concentrated so it lasts forever and it gets my face really clean. And I like using oils for moisturizers (just not a lot cause I’m already oily) but I love tarte maracuja oil 
2097 2018-03-07 19:35:26 tbh emu is my fave. and for hair. they say sunflower oil is good too if you mix with rosehip
2098 2018-03-07 19:35:25 Nadine, Don’t be a coward. It is a trade war. Sacrifices must be made in war time. Negotiating by conceding is losing. JK is doing more for AB Gay friendly Oil by taking the fight to the front line.

2100 2018-03-07 19:35:12 Lowkey feel like leaving early today. I haven't done not one oil change
2101 2018-03-07 19:34:51 I had to sleep with the brace on and keep putting the oil on cos my wrist kept hurting 
2102 2018-03-07 19:34:45 Because this guys environmental plan is nil. He doesn’t give a shit about national parks. If there’s coal, oil ,or natural gas in our last places of sanctuary like National parks then they’re going to dig it up be damned the future
2103 2018-03-07 19:34:39 Neuquén Gov. @OmarGutierrezOk will discuss the province’s unconventional oil and gas bonanza at @The_Dialogue on March 27, and #Argentina’s “challenges to develop its shale resources.” @camillerimj

2106 2018-03-07 19:34:06 That my friend is a classic oil pan failure

2109 2018-03-07 19:33:43 They owe my father over 10million Naira from oil He supplied since over 3 years ago, they shouldn't sell it yet oh. They should pay their debt first abeg. The whole family is suffering
2110 2018-03-07 19:33:39 I've been using The Weeds™ (cbd oil) this past week as it was recommended for my anxiety and now I think I know how it feels to be one of those cats that need valium
2111 2018-03-07 19:33:32 Not just AW staying, he had to compete consistently to stay in the CL and other competitions for the loan to be granted. How did he know he could do that, competing against the oil money of Chelsea and City, and Man Utd?
2112 2018-03-07 19:33:27 You certainly infered limits on CO2 with your examples of excess or I'm completely lost on what u r trying to say. (Either way, an original founder of Greenpeace didnt like it.) But hey, keep slamming the Oil Industry as irrational as it looks....
2113 2018-03-07 19:33:13 Coconut Oil is shelf stable so keep it out of the fridge. You can melt it and use in anything that calls for vegetable oil. Use it as a moisturizer on your skin,oil pulling to protect and naturally whiten your teeth. Perfect oil to pop popcorn. 
2114 2018-03-07 19:33:12 I think we eventually have to put down Mr Pump. He is getting too old, and is a burden to our twitter oil family......
2115 2018-03-07 19:33:00 This Idiot should never have been invited & living in the U.S. where that Country will soon be the largest oil producer in the world, THIS U.S. Nutbar that believes in his Liberal/Democrat beliefs should maybe try to clean up his own back yard---EH???
2116 2018-03-07 19:32:51 Honestly I don’t think anyone was super stoked when the trade went down. Because Larsson hasn’t replicated last seasons success the trade has looked worse. Doesn’t help that Hall is on a 26th game winning streak....if Oil were in playoff contention would we be having this convo ?
2117 2018-03-07 19:32:30 No ma'am I soak my ear inside palm oil  u re so deaf in love 2 hear his sexist comment 
2118 2018-03-07 19:32:24 Broadford Bridge will never go tits up with you around !!
2119 2018-03-07 19:32:18 And skin softening stuff applied would help at other times like say a cocoa butter or baby oil? anything to really moisturise it up a bit .
2120 2018-03-07 19:32:12 i also recommend emu oil

2124 2018-03-07 19:31:33 No matter how big the pipeline or large the tank farm, if AB or BC can’t/won’t refine enough oil to meet pop'n growth, we’ll continue to rely on US imports to make up the shortfall, buying back our resource at a premium.  Exporting more raw bitumen isn't going to solve this.
2125 2018-03-07 19:31:13 Rosehip oil recommended to me by heart transplant recipient so very relevant for your friend.
2126 2018-03-07 19:31:00 Without reading the article, it is still minimum wage.  One needs to look at the median hourly wage, not the average.  Estimates of maintenance on car are highly underreported to feel better.  It is not just about putting gas in car - tires, oil changes, routine maintenance, ins.
2127 2018-03-07 19:30:50 Protectionism, from his Bus/Adm 101, is not the answer.  I think he skipped class that day, was probably w/some babe.  Most consumers won't pay 2-5x more to protect US jobs.  He should be seeding new industries, like clean alternative energy.  But that'd tick off his oil cronies.
2128 2018-03-07 19:30:39 I’m here getting an oil change and I forgot my engine bay looks like a gold fucking mess I’m embarrassed
2129 2018-03-07 19:30:36 End the trade deficit overnight, sell oil and military hardware to China.

2139 2018-03-07 19:29:24 Then why are you complaining that some people want that money to go toward alternative energy? What’s good for one sector (ie. oil and gas) is good for all sectors.
2140 2018-03-07 19:29:23 Does "mining" include oil & gas?
2141 2018-03-07 19:29:12 He probably smokes dirty brown dabs. Bad quality hash/oil lol.
2142 2018-03-07 19:29:06 $400 dollars later, registration , inspection , 4 tires , oil change . I need to be adopted. I clean my room & wash dishes.
2143 2018-03-07 19:28:49 Prob wasn’t a legit oil then :/ I only use Young Living on my face!

2147 2018-03-07 19:28:23 I’m not sure I’m up for that!  It’s been sat in my bin outside!  I can’t see anything in the instructions that say oil it first...it’s now 4 days old and festering.  No chance it’s coming back in my kitchen like this!!
2148 2018-03-07 19:28:23 65 for an oil change LOL
2149 2018-03-07 19:28:20 Your business model is essentially intellectual theft: you stole the ideas of snake oil sellers and telepreachers.
2150 2018-03-07 19:28:19 Why do I have to love Moroccan Oil products? I’d save so much money if I didn’t.
2151 2018-03-07 19:28:11 Olive oil can be massaged into the skin. Over time it makes your skin appear very toned.
2152 2018-03-07 19:28:08 rosehip oil tbh RT @brownsugarbaeee: I need something natural for hyperpigmentation (face)  help
2153 2018-03-07 19:28:02 Then you ask yourself how much was PDP sold crude oil in 16 years compare to APC

2162 2018-03-07 19:26:51 Boiler engineer Friday. Heating oil delivery next Tuesday (stupid!!). Fires & sponge baths meanwhile... 
2163 2018-03-07 19:26:49 Oh dear.  I mean oil would be very bad for you but at least it would be crispy and tasty. Probably.
2164 2018-03-07 19:26:40 Oil from a 1969 Camaro instead of sauce
2165 2018-03-07 19:26:24 I demand they bring back whale oil! How can we go back to a time before whale oil? What, do we go back to the 1700s?
2166 2018-03-07 19:26:11 Agree abt. promoting healthy fats!  When @markhymanmd was on @DrOz show, he had a lady eating a snack of avocado filled w/ olive oil dressing! @davidludwigmd's new book has chicken recipe w/35-40% *added* olive oil cals.  Few people eat true LF or don't get enough fat from foods.
2167 2018-03-07 19:26:05 New fav salad dressing ketchup and sesame oil

2169 2018-03-07 19:26:01 Protectionism, from Trump's Bus/Adm 101, is not the answer.  I think he skipped class that day, probably w/some babe.  Most consumers won't pay 2-5x more 4 everything 2 protect US jobs.  U should be seeding new industries, like alt energy.  But that would tick off his oil buddies

2173 2018-03-07 19:25:23 Cook chicken breast for atleast 30 mins in olive oil. Great way to lose meal and weight. #lifehacks
2174 2018-03-07 19:25:21 Try putting the verse and my voice sounded like someone eating pounded yam and red oil  work work all day 
2175 2018-03-07 19:25:19 Also like buying food with Palm oil in it - you now need to dig through the stock feed ingredients to ensure there isn't any Palm products in it.
2176 2018-03-07 19:25:09 - Are you hungry? 
Yes.

Do you wanna try K&n's Mughlai tikka? 
No. How could one possibly ship "fully cooked" food in the box? And for months it doesn't expire. I don't buy it!

Khana hay k nahi seedhi tarha batao? 
Nahi.

Fried chips khao gay? 
Nahi. Oil is injurious to health.
2177 2018-03-07 19:25:06 *applies coconut oil to my anxiety*
2178 2018-03-07 19:24:45 But you just allowed millions of acres to be exploited for oil.
2179 2018-03-07 19:24:36 Lol I'm for @nelsonchamisa, but let's not stretch it guys.

Oil money is different exporting unprocessed minerals and agriculture produce.

2209 2018-03-07 19:21:00 Yes, it’s really is that stupid. The Tories decimated British industry and focussed on financial services. Scottish whisky and salmon make up 22% of UK exports. We also have 96% of UK oil in our waters. You can see why they’ll fight tooth and nail to keep us.

2239 2018-03-07 19:15:08 You can also, as I do, believe that Russophobia is whipped up by Western powers to justify geopolitical war games as well as cementing higher funding towards the military budgets. Geopolitical wars lead to control over oil and resources which back up the petrodollar and prices.

Final goal of every created panic is NEVER war but control of resources(water/oil).

2262 2018-03-07 19:12:46 I’m glad I only have to get an oil change once a year... took 3 hours to get one today and when I get my truck it’s making a strange noise. Turns out one of the techs left some nuts loose on one of my tires. Great! (@VeraCadillac)

2264 2018-03-07 19:12:29 @POTUS Additional oil production is great for America but if we don't add refining capacity won't that inhibit what America can gain with this new crude? Last refining plant built in 1977! Just concerned.
2265 2018-03-07 19:12:25 Thanks VP! Purdue studies: RIN price caps (Cruz’s best idea to throttle renewables in favor of big oil) will gut the RFS.

2272 2018-03-07 19:11:39 Wouldn't it be more profitable in the long run to consume/import everyone else's minerals/oil/coal, leaving ours untouched, and THEN corner the non-renewables market after their supplies get scarce?

I thought it was obvious.

Did something threaten that strategy?

2311 2018-03-07 19:06:37 The result is that this Alaskan-de­rived fish oil has a greater than five-fold reduction in the upper level threshold measurement for oxidation. Current oxidation standards for quality fish oils ensure products free from rancidity.

2331 2018-03-07 19:04:54 Why do we even make #steel in the USA? Shut down the industry. There is absolutely no reason other countries would stop selling steel to us. Besides, it's cheaper. 100% dependence on foreign steel makes us stronger. Just like 100% dependence on foreign oil would. no #steeltariffs

2342 2018-03-07 19:03:36 As oil use inevitably declines through efficiency and choice of other fuel/energy options, Exxon needs to enlarge the scope of its mission from just "Oil" to "Energy." But I'm sure they see the writing on the wall. Right?

2361 2018-03-07 19:01:16 Do you choose an oil based on a chemical component? Why?
2362 2018-03-07 19:01:15 Let me tell y’all a little story about imports from Sauudi vs Iraq:

Iraq has no fleet. Amreeka orders oil from Iraq and the good folks at LOOP clear it all in advance.

Sauudi has a massive fleet. They run OPEC. They can park in the GoM for weeks without transferring a drop.

2455 2018-03-07 18:51:46 Yes, that is possible. Oil price would fall but refinery margins would go up, which could go either way in terms of the price paid consumer. Transfer of rent/profit from producers to refiners. Possibly oil use would be transferred to electricity generation but I doubt it.
2456 2018-03-07 18:51:46 The USA has been self sufficeint in oil production s since 2012 and in 2014 passed Russia as the worlds 4th largest oil producer.
2457 2018-03-07 18:51:45 But high paying Green jobs will replace those oil sector jobs. Pure bullshit!

2463 2018-03-07 18:50:28 Would someone please ask these people what is it they dont understand about differnece between CBD oil for medical treatments vs marijuana for rec use.There is a huge difference.CBD oil for cancer nausea,easing pain and epilepsy in kids
2464 2018-03-07 18:50:20 I can't figure it out. I don't get the oil people, or the supplement people. Why would you put these things in your body!?!
2465 2018-03-07 18:50:16 Which oil/cream do you use for your beard?
2466 2018-03-07 18:50:11 Truth is always like oil in water... 
No matter how much of water you

it always floats on top...

2467 2018-03-07 18:50:09 "UKCS production of crude oil and NGLs in 2016 was 21% higher 
than in 2014’"...interesting indeed.
2468 2018-03-07 18:49:50 Oh boy, this person on my Facebook shared another one of those panic-inducing posts.

This one's about how oranges are grown with oil wastewater and are radioactive
2469 2018-03-07 18:49:48 geranium oil helps mine a lot ! also arnica, havent tried but its known for helping bruising
2470 2018-03-07 18:49:46 I don't often love @JerryBrownGov, but watching him get revved up against the Trump admin "bringing the mendacity of Washington to California," is fun to watch. 

If only he'd bring that same fire to an oil industry intent upon destroying our climate.

2473 2018-03-07 18:49:19 Hell no lmao hot oil is dangerous as hell
2474 2018-03-07 18:49:11 oh!イル
2475 2018-03-07 18:49:09 Most olive oil dispensers are actually not ideal for olive oil storage, as they expose the oil to two of its natural enemies: light and oxygen. Tall glass dispensers (the most iconic ones) allow plenty of both in. And if you're keeping the olive oil dispenser by the stove, y…
2476 2018-03-07 18:49:04 Sure a few minimum wage jobs while Allen buys dictator oil. World oil consumption is increasing every year. How many  are ok to be tossed in dictator regimes?  @vancouverpride @uvicpride @MikeSmythNews

2480 2018-03-07 18:48:41 @GordonRamsay #1 key ingredient to all great tasting food? 

A tablespoon of olive oil
2481 2018-03-07 18:48:40 Then you need to make some.. stop buying and make!  and it stores well in fridge for 4-5 days. No pine nuts in Pistou but you could add to make pesto. Basil, Parmesan, EV olive oil, garlic clove, pepper... Simple dimples and sooooooooo much better than store crap
2482 2018-03-07 18:48:26 Liar @SpeakerRyan The house wants 2destroy our planet by giving the Oil / coal industry permission to pollute our water & air you're as pathetic and disgraceful as #45
2483 2018-03-07 18:48:22 As do orange oil wipes!
2484 2018-03-07 18:48:03 I hope you're right.  You'd think video proof would be enough - like they say, once you strike oil, stop digging and do something about it.
2485 2018-03-07 18:47:58 USA’s trade deficit with China would be much higher if US gov counted the food, fossil fuels, metal & oil products et al. produced by foreign companies in USA as rather than by US co—& if Canada, Mexico et al. didn’t hide that many of their exports to USA were produced by China.
2486 2018-03-07 18:47:51 You mean like nearly EVERYONE in the country does?
2487 2018-03-07 18:47:41 Still got the shot, I’m just a machine that needs a bit of oil to get the cogs moving
2488 2018-03-07 18:47:36 #OOTT | The generalized market anxiety over what could end up being a global trade war is dragging everything down. It does not bode well for future economic growth and increased energy demand. @KilduffReport #WTI #Brent #Oil
2489 2018-03-07 18:47:19 Oil Prices fell as financial markets slid after a free trade advocate quit the U.S. government, feeding concerns that Trump's plans for import tariffs could spark a trade war.

2494 2018-03-07 18:46:55 Diane, What is your choice?  Canada’s Feminist Oil at tidewater displaces dictator oil from regimes that oppress WOMEN. Opposing Pipelines = enriching dictators who oppress women. @OttCapitalPride @PrideToronto
2495 2018-03-07 18:46:55 totally off #TaxBuzzChat but this reminds me of that old TV commercial "if you don't have an oil well, get one!" #EddieChiles
2496 2018-03-07 18:46:49 Coconut oil helps
2497 2018-03-07 18:46:49 LOL. I think I saw someone making them with Pleather & metal rivets. Can also do Oil Cloth or stabilized fabric. 

Also I think you could make some interesting denim ones with some zig zag stitching and fray check... without a serger.
2498 2018-03-07 18:46:31 why we have sufficient oil reserves, but we have to pay way more money on gas comparatively US!!!!!

2501 2018-03-07 18:45:58 Oil is at $65.79 Brent. Stable
2502 2018-03-07 18:45:49 The only people that say this are the people that lather their mugs (beautiful mugs in your case ) with it and go out in the baking sun expecting a miracle. Coconut oil works Wonder but you’ve got to know your skin and when you should use it.
2503 2018-03-07 18:45:41 I don’t see how getting Russia over Iran in Syria getting a ally in Kurds and having Turkish ally and Kurds hold land including oil could ever be seen as a loss. But continue with your delusions.

Freeh's work on the BP oil spill claims matter as well as for Steve Wynn and the Penn State trustee resulted in a slew of lawsuits.

2526 2018-03-07 18:42:52 The petro is an oil-backed currency that the government of Venezuela launched as a resource for avoiding US financial sanctions and reenact the economy. Petro buyers can exchange the currency with a barrel of crude oil.

2530 2018-03-07 18:42:15 Cook the crust for a while brushed with olive oil. Then add whatever sauce cheese you’re using midway through. Different cheeses take different times. I make pizza every week, but don’t like red sauce.
2531 2018-03-07 18:42:13 Welp, made an appointment to get my oil changed & realized my car is at the bar so there’s that
2532 2018-03-07 18:42:08 Hey!! Do t blame us!! His parent's were Americans working in the Oil Industry here for 3 years. They moved to Texas and raised him there to be the petty, Pro gun, anti abortion, pro death penalty (not   ) right wing nut job that he is today. Don't send him back!!!!!
2533 2018-03-07 18:41:51 I know. I usually just put slices in the oven with some olive oil, salt, and pepper. I want to try to make zoodles soon
2534 2018-03-07 18:41:39 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Oakland sleeps.

2542 2018-03-07 18:40:49 Tea tree oil is suppose to act as a deterrent. We add it to our shampoo and body wash bathing in the morning b4 adventure and touching up with it when we apply bug spray.

2546 2018-03-07 18:40:22 @steeletalk Have you thought of asking Premier Horgan why the carbon tax is being raised?  What doesn’t make sense about this tax hike is the fact that the cost of a barrel of oil is very low.

2554 2018-03-07 18:39:46 Related: have you tried Emergen-C with a light oil like Argan as a scrub/mask yet? Because it is THE BEST TIME
2555 2018-03-07 18:39:38 Thank you for this. One of my biggest insecurities has been my acne/acne scarring. Just know you’re beautiful inside & out no matter what a little oil does to your pores. Can’t wait to buy your album on vinyl!!!!!

2574 2018-03-07 18:38:27 Please invite boaters as well, who initially pushed for lock closures to stop the oil spreading, and who have been out every day monitoring, cleaning up, pulling dead animals out of the water, supporting the @Swan_Sanctuary in their efforts to save wildlife, ..

2578 2018-03-07 18:38:06 The idea of expanding oil infrastructure is abdicating leadership.  Canada can help human rights by building green jobs.
2579 2018-03-07 18:38:00 Mentions of Marxism and communism and Socialism increase exponentially relative to hours of Fox News viewed per day even though we paradoxically live in a Kleptocratic State featuring for example heavily subsidized industrial carcinogen drenched agriculture and oil extraction.
2580 2018-03-07 18:37:54 Naira don dey turn coloured paper gradually o. To think that during the oil boom, it was in the same league with the £ will further send cold shivers down your spine. Yet, Still no hope in sight.
2581 2018-03-07 18:37:53 Lisa,
Stop it. Sending you a moral compass.

You sold us out to corporations and big oil.
You got a tax break. So did Trump.
Where's people's health care?

You can apologize and resign.
No more lies. 

@SenDanSullivan @AkGovBillWalker
2582 2018-03-07 18:37:49 What is up with the extreme shine??? Did they plunge their faces in oil after putting their foundation on??
2583 2018-03-07 18:37:46 Also, he's right to question the plausibility of a replacement plan on that timeline.

Coal is doomed. Oil may be eventually. But you need an economical replacement that can be done at scale before either will disappear.
2584 2018-03-07 18:37:34 We will still need to use oil fueled vehicles until we transition to alternative sources that are less harmful. That will take time, and we should initiate this more aggressively. Oil companies have to face facts...
2585 2018-03-07 18:37:31 Most of my good recipes that use oil instead of butter require some other ingredient that I don't have in house. I did not prepare well for this.
2586 2018-03-07 18:37:25 Ah. Shows how much I know about cars. I was like yeah ha ha the oil flange that sounds like it could be real.
2587 2018-03-07 18:37:20 Yes. Just fry the oil reallll hot.
2588 2018-03-07 18:37:15 Please stop this! We need solar panels, windmills, tidemills, not oil/gas. No more dinosaur fuel, it’s poison.

Trump, park one outside your homes in nj and Florida.
2589 2018-03-07 18:37:13 I know that’s why smoke regular weed and then take cbd oil
2590 2018-03-07 18:37:10 I’d be shocked if there’s oil in Bears Ears. Coal, certainly. Gas-coal bed methane, maybe. But the reason Bears Ears was gutted had nothing to do with oil or Russia or treason or money even. GOP and their rich backers simply hate government, except borders, police and prisons.
2591 2018-03-07 18:37:02 So in other words....bring back whale oil?

2598 2018-03-07 18:36:28 Oil dL ka
2599 2018-03-07 18:36:13 And - correct me if I'm wrong on this one, energy dist. is @DaveKeto's wheelhouse not mine. Wouldn't LMHR also have higher apoB? Would that in itself increase risk if they got, for example, a severe infection or drank a gallon of seed oil? Or could it be protective?
2600 2018-03-07 18:36:13 This, and the changes to offshore drilling are further examples of big grabs for the oil industry and backwards carbon based energy.  If you want power from the shores do it clean - build windmills.  Environment, Conservation, Wild life preservation need to trump greed
2601 2018-03-07 18:36:04 Are you sure it’s oil? Because there happens to be a uranium mine there too.
2602 2018-03-07 18:35:57 That's a good point you have made Irvin, Muslim making cannabis oil in Grenfell already had a criminal record, let off, two Halal slaughtermen filmed being cruel to animals, let off, 1/2
2603 2018-03-07 18:35:56 Basta de despidos.. mas de 400 en cordón industrial x cierre de Oil Combustible
2604 2018-03-07 18:35:45 Cage fight aficionado, with a preference for young, blonde, female, covered in oil.
2605 2018-03-07 18:35:42 A bronzing facial mask, sultry red, with cochineal, tea tree oil, and exfoliating fig seeds. It comes as a gel in a wooden tube.
2606 2018-03-07 18:35:16 Honestly me neither. I think I made up the oil flange though.
2607 2018-03-07 18:35:14 Actually, aglio olio pepperoncino should require no instruction. Good garlic- crushed not cut, dark olive oil- never mind its virginity, dry red chillies- flaked, not powdered: all in generous proportions. Add spaghetti cooked so dente. Serve hot.
2608 2018-03-07 18:35:13 Hey, can I have some oil, dis bitch is thirsty
2609 2018-03-07 18:35:11 Let's get our definitions straight. Gov't control of privately owned assets is FASCISM not capitalism. Profits are the price of efficiency which is why PDVSA is failing despite having the world's LARGEST oil reserves! Price controls result in shortages. Read an economics book.
2610 2018-03-07 18:35:07 I think Russia and America does not see the middle eastern countries just as an oil resource or a war base i believe it's against their religion. So it's multipurpose and get nightmares that it would soon turn towards Indians and Chinese . Rit? Or Not? Bro @Vignesh_Veera
2611 2018-03-07 18:35:05 Oil
2612 2018-03-07 18:35:01 Also his pasta would be like tomato, olive oil, nutmeg, avocado and various white tomfoolery
2613 2018-03-07 18:34:37 Yepdi Chellam thurupudikama maintain panra.. Adikadi Thaniya oil service ah
2614 2018-03-07 18:34:34 Did you see that article where a woman asked straight men their skin routines and some were like “dove soap. If it’s good enough for animals in oil spills it’s good enough for me” and “hand sanitizer because it makes my skin feel tight”
2615 2018-03-07 18:34:10 Creepy indeed.
2616 2018-03-07 18:34:06 I don't think terrorism will shake Nigeria as much as the end of easy oil money.
2617 2018-03-07 18:34:04 Thank you, what can we do? We don’t want oil spills ,the ugliness of the drilling..heck, we can’t even get revenue energy producing windmills, which I support.
No to oil, gas;no no no no
@SenatorCollins @RepPoliquin @chelliepingree @MaineIslandsNWR @audubonsociety
2618 2018-03-07 18:34:04 Is the hydrating oil only on the ABH website?
2619 2018-03-07 18:34:03 Subsidies for ethanol ended years ago. However, billions in annual subsidies for oil companies remain in place.
2620 2018-03-07 18:33:50 Brilliant. 
2621 2018-03-07 18:33:33 This Particular One Serves As The HQ To His Real Estate, Oil & Gas As Well As Telecom Companies
2622 2018-03-07 18:33:31 As I said oil and water do not mix. Of course you will not  agree with the principle I was describing. That’s life!
2623 2018-03-07 18:33:28 Who ever heard of fossil fuels in the mid-1800's? I mean, besides those coal and oil barons.
2624 2018-03-07 18:32:51 @Biba_Orion oil ready for pick up sis.
2625 2018-03-07 18:32:48 Is this like the art equivalent of standing behind someone as they work on your car going "have you uh.. Checked... The flanges? The oil flange?"
2626 2018-03-07 18:32:47 Money, power, oil & cosiness with a barbaric state!!
2627 2018-03-07 18:32:47 I hate you  oil lot more than them

2629 2018-03-07 18:32:36 My low oil pressure light came on today so I don't want to drive any more than I have to before I take it in tomorrow, buuttt I really want Dirty Ron's for lunch
2630 2018-03-07 18:32:31 Allow those clowns to compare oil and water. Enjoy the greatests of all time in your life time.
2631 2018-03-07 18:32:26 "BP, bringing oil to US shores."
2632 2018-03-07 18:32:16 @Khadee_Smiles your oil is ready for pick up o
2633 2018-03-07 18:32:14 It’s a vitamin E/rosehip oil combo that I just massage on. Silicone strips/gel/lube work well too
2634 2018-03-07 18:32:06 Jerk Pay Oil&Gas royalty as the 12th Finance Commission recommended
First then we will surely pay for the minerals.

2635 2018-03-07 18:31:58 Kenney trying to prove he's premier material by threatening people online  and not understanding /lying about jurisdiction over oil.
2636 2018-03-07 18:31:35 Discussed Colorado's leading-edge regulations on methane emissions today at @CERAWeek #CERAWeek2018. 

Well done to @hickforco, @EnvDefenseFund, @Anadarko_Oil, @encana, @nblenergy, and others.
2637 2018-03-07 18:31:29 We had a new engine put in our truck and went in for the first oil change and was told we needed something done because it was dirty. Husband was like, it may say 130,000, but it’s only 3. Not amused, lol!
2638 2018-03-07 18:31:25 I just oiled my entire body with coconut oil 
2639 2018-03-07 18:31:22 That jojoba oil really does something for my hair S/O to Grams .
2640 2018-03-07 18:31:14 Yet not surprising.  We need a giant extinction event in Idaho to kill off uninformed legislators.  Probably the same group that voted against CBD oil.
2641 2018-03-07 18:31:11 17 under 89 working lovingly by virtue of Oil & Energy.
2642 2018-03-07 18:30:53 Ah, that reminds her. She took out a loose leaf paper from the printer and began writing things down. Like prices for an oil change. Tune up. Simple questions like that.

"If they ask about customer orders tell em I'll call em back before the day is out. You can answer as: Hey,"+
2643 2018-03-07 18:30:46 A thick layer of coconut oil might make it heal a little faster and can help prevent scaring if that helps! I’m proud of you for being who you are, that takes a ton of courage!
2644 2018-03-07 18:30:40 Draxler moaning about his team not pressing and not making progress.
Bitch, you're the one who chose oil money over Liverpool.
2645 2018-03-07 18:30:38 Trump may have commissioned some classy oil-on-canvas dick pics.
2646 2018-03-07 18:30:35 I swear i been asking my dad to check my cars oil for like 2 weeks now 
2647 2018-03-07 18:30:32 Good point. And, oh yes, Urals problems is that's getting too heavy and too sulphurous. Maybe you guys need some shale oil to dilute? :-)
2648 2018-03-07 18:30:30 It took 20 years to get lead out of gas. Big Oil scientist said lead was safe and US govt agreed.
2649 2018-03-07 18:30:20 Or add flax seeds, chia seeds (I think chia needs to be soaked first?), hemp seeds, flax seed oil, olive oil, or coconut oil.
2650 2018-03-07 18:30:19 Could be a Gearbox oil/fluid leak.
Check the levels. I’m getting mine sorted tomorrow. Smells like burning but irritates your eyes?
2651 2018-03-07 18:30:17 OIL DIFF: 3.32 -> 3.36
2652 2018-03-07 18:30:16 Try peppermint oil in the bath. Also a light meal of something you really like 
2653 2018-03-07 18:30:05 Prime Minister met with Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia today and yet Zimbabwe still has sanctions imposed. These man don't care about human rights  if you have something they want (oil, location) you can get away with murder in your country-literally.
2654 2018-03-07 18:30:02 Got the wrong part to fix wildcat, tranny went out on truck, dropped my phone in a bucket of oil, woke up an hr late for work what’s next?
2655 2018-03-07 18:29:46 Yes it is really dirty and wrong to steal. Imagine invading a foreign nation, toppling the government and taking all their natural resources such as oil and gold. Keeping all the profits for yourself while you're fellow tax paying citizens foot the bill for generations to come.
2656 2018-03-07 18:29:38 I agree. Bill Nye has no business coming in and telling Canada how to proceed on this. His opinion is null and void. Reality is until we have an affordable, sustainable alternative we need oil.
2657 2018-03-07 18:29:27 @FirestoneAuto #Frustrated! 11:00 appointment for an oil change and tire rotation. Hour and half later, just starting the oil change. Thanks Firestone on McCain North Little Rock for making me late getting back to work!
2658 2018-03-07 18:29:11 Lamar, how about you fire Zinke? The man is selling off our National Lands & Parks. He is for oil, gas and strip mining.
2659 2018-03-07 18:29:10 WTI oil at $62.28/barrel, -$0.32.
2660 2018-03-07 18:29:03 thats what google maps gives you when you type in oil sands.

2662 2018-03-07 18:28:59 What kind of motor oil do y'all use VALVOLINE, PENZOIL, GTX, or MOBILE
2663 2018-03-07 18:28:58 So $2,000 an acre? Rep. Hill once told me land was about $600/acre unless there was oil/gas.
2664 2018-03-07 18:28:56 I wonder if her mom ever showed her how to make sammiches.
2665 2018-03-07 18:28:55 Fact: 30 percent of Europe's oil goes through the Gulf of Aden and Red Sea.
2666 2018-03-07 18:28:44 Me and gearbox oil just do not get along...the smell is honestly something else
2667 2018-03-07 18:28:41 "oil sands action"? GMAFB pal
2668 2018-03-07 18:28:38 The items that they should tariff are things that affect the Elites not the poor. For many people peanut butter and juice are their only food. How about olive oil, Wines, Almonds. Etc. this will get their attention.
2669 2018-03-07 18:28:37 EV coconut oil helps stabilize blood sugar and the fat will keep you satiated longer
2670 2018-03-07 18:28:37 I watched a game featuring “Rainbow” Steve Trout vs Dennis “Oil Can” Boyd in seats I moved down to cause I couldn’t afford the $12 it cost
2671 2018-03-07 18:28:27 Oh, and so much for the "even if the shot isn't a good match, you still have some protection" argument. Flu shots are nothing more than modern day snake oil.
2672 2018-03-07 18:28:23 I'm also glad we're investing in good ol' coal, steel, and whale oil again!
2673 2018-03-07 18:28:21 I'm skeptical on how will this happen. MoO becomes a regulatory body while INOC an operator? How is this different from SOC's previous job scope? Seems like SOC was replaced by INOC. Many in Basra will not be pleased that oil regulatory & operational control now moves to Baghdad.
2674 2018-03-07 18:28:01 Bollocks to what anyone else thinks. This Spurs team is the best I've seen in my entire life. I love them & wouldn't swap them for anything, not oil money, not even trophies. I remember going to school and telling my mates we'd qualify for the UEFA Cup and it'd be a triumph #THFC
2675 2018-03-07 18:27:52 El héroe de @genarolozano !
2676 2018-03-07 18:27:37 I need to go to Ulta but i also need an oil change...which do i spend money on....my car could blow up but when it does my skin will be nice .....

2679 2018-03-07 18:26:56 Yes, I remember when they where a have-not province.

Then they got oil and became rich.
Conservatives believe they became rich because of their policies, not oil.

Conservatives everywhere just have "alternative" way of looking at things
2680 2018-03-07 18:26:56 I’ve had the full size Drunk Elephant Marula Oil sitting in my cart for weeks and now that @itsbl0ndie approves I’m definitely going to have to get it.
2681 2018-03-07 18:26:50 Ophir Energy, the independent upstream O&G company focused on Asia & Africa, confirms that the Fortuna project, located offshore Equatorial Guinea, could produce 1st gas by early 2022 #Oil #EquatorialGuinea #business #Africa

2684 2018-03-07 18:26:28 $XOM trading lower then when oil was at $28.00. Last check oil is over $60.00. Start buying or sell some ATM puts.
2685 2018-03-07 18:26:12 It's selective. The Saudis have massive wealth & oil. It's too much for our government to risk. We'll continue to hand over huge amounts of weapons. I'm all for diplomatic relations. I just can't stand sending weapons to a country that uses them against civilians.
2686 2018-03-07 18:25:59 Physical #oil market feeling the soft seasonal demand with refinery turnaround. Look at Russian Ural crude, trading at its largest discount to Brent in the Mediterranean market in 4 years -- via @rupertrowling#OOTT
2687 2018-03-07 18:25:58 Yes, there is US/Israel partnership exploiting oil resources On #Syria's #GolandHeights. This is against international law, but nobody influential seems to care. Israel also drains water from there.

2690 2018-03-07 18:25:33 Yeah, but they didn't make you a bag man delivering to the shills!
2691 2018-03-07 18:25:27 Yes! It looked watery or like a moving oil slick at times. My regular migraines don't do that, but the ocular ones are a hot mess that end right when I decide I'm going blind.
2692 2018-03-07 18:25:17 Joselito, I agree this is about apostasy, as the parables before and after it. What do you think is the reason in this case? Why do you think the foolish virgins came without extra flasks of oil?
2693 2018-03-07 18:25:08 jojoba oil is rly that bitch!

2695 2018-03-07 18:24:58 One of trumps goals in early campaign was to get oil from our own parks.  That was the last straw for me and I hated him that early!

2702 2018-03-07 18:24:18 i'm trying V hard to flirt with this v masc guy who spends his days off changing the oil in his truck and playing sports but I have literally no idea what to talk about is this what straight girls feel like?
2703 2018-03-07 18:24:08 I had a fantastic poki roll last week.... tuna, sesame oil, and chili sauce. It was addictive, but possibly unique to the place we ate.
2704 2018-03-07 18:24:01 I literally smell like coconut oil 24/7 bc im constantly applying it
2705 2018-03-07 18:23:54 Tea Tree Oil
2706 2018-03-07 18:23:45 I don’t even know how to check my cars oil, but I’ll have an accounting degree 
2707 2018-03-07 18:23:44 Great!!!  I switched some three years ago when "yous guys" were at Bantam Jeep in Butler PA.  I use your oil in all my vehicles, and I get it at my local @NAPAKnowHow @NAPAFilters
2708 2018-03-07 18:23:44 Thc oil. Hit Ashton, i know he got a plug too.
2709 2018-03-07 18:23:38 Wow. All you have is projection. You just described Trump's base, genius. No wonder you voted for a snake oil salesman.
2710 2018-03-07 18:23:38 The guy is a total joke. All that's missing are a red nose and floppy shoes. A mechanical engineer, not the kind of guy you need to vent unintelligent comments about  Alberta's oil sands. But hey, with this PM we should not be surprised. Virtue signalling is surely worth 100K....
2711 2018-03-07 18:23:28 Really could cry... car starts over heating... I go to check my coolant & oil is mixing in with my coolant... 
2712 2018-03-07 18:23:23 I made the switch -- the hours are better and the cannabis industry offers a work/life balance that I never had when I worked in a restaurant.
2713 2018-03-07 18:23:17 British Tory Government Prostituting itself to Saudi Heads & Hands Choppers only for oil - they are the Scum on this Earth.
2714 2018-03-07 18:23:17 Depends on what you mean by modern US conservative. A true 'let the free market reign' conservative would end oil tax breaks and help electric cars compete quicker. But 2018 US Republicans beholden to big oil won't do that.
2715 2018-03-07 18:22:48 KJVA Bible. Hebrews 1:9
[9]Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
2716 2018-03-07 18:22:46 PM was defending the oil sands dumba$$
2717 2018-03-07 18:22:42 This is a interesting thought that gun makers have their hands in the pocket of the government. Gun makers are specks in the business world. Banks, insurance, and oil write more policies through donations than anyone. Politicians that protect 2a do it because they believe in it.

2719 2018-03-07 18:22:21 Listening to it now. Enjoying it! Sometimes I fall asleep in seconds. Other times my mind runs like crazy. Have you tried vetiver essential oil under your big toe before bed? If you don’t have any or don’t have friends who have it, I’ll send you some so you can give it a shot.
2720 2018-03-07 18:22:16 That cuticle oil smell sooo good
2721 2018-03-07 18:22:01 They had some oil to start with because their lamps were running out around midnight. Why do you think they didn’t have enough to last them until the Bridegroom came?
2722 2018-03-07 18:22:00 Yessss baby we stan a full lipped legend go off volume go off softness is she jojoba oil might as well be
2723 2018-03-07 18:21:44 Cars Laws - An oil leak will develop.

2725 2018-03-07 18:21:33 Do any of you speak Russian and are you willing to talk to me about the differences between peanut butter and peanut oil? 

(and yes, before the internet offers, I *do* know how to use Google Translate and other translation tools)
2726 2018-03-07 18:21:30 I'm doing the Keto Diet with IF, and I'm having a hard time consuming the number of Fats I need. Should I just drink Olive Oil or something? (Please say no)

2727 2018-03-07 18:21:03 Yes, from the Castor Oil plant. Which you will find in many Council flower beds around the country. They even have some outside St Paul's Underground Staton in London.
2728 2018-03-07 18:21:02 being laid up, way too cozy under covers and hitting the oil pen and listening to jungle is the movement right now
2729 2018-03-07 18:21:01 BP, Deepwater Horizon type oil spill off the coast of Maine is unthinkable.
Unthinkable..!
2730 2018-03-07 18:20:38 Put crushed red pepper in the hot oil before the corn goes in.   Makes for a spicy popcorn and not soggy!
2731 2018-03-07 18:20:35 Tf.... next thing would be to use palm oil to eat cereal.
2732 2018-03-07 18:20:34 Wondering about those people who might have been in that pub the two victims visited. 

Same colour as beer, maybe:

VX is an oily liquid - amber in color and very slow to evaporate. It evaporates about as slowly as motor oil.
2733 2018-03-07 18:20:31 Neil, you seem principled and pragmatic, I don't agree with you on the oil pipeline but you've gained my respect
2734 2018-03-07 18:20:31 Using oil and coal and natural gas at a rate faster than it is replaced by nature is by definition deficit spending.
2735 2018-03-07 18:20:23 Modi will give oil & gas to Ambani. Petrol for Rs-30 Per Litre. He will sell to us for Rs:75 Per Litre. Per Litre Rs:45 will be the profit. Ambani will take Rs:35 from profit for his use. Rs:10 will be given to BJP to Build A New Office for 1500 Cr. As World Largest Office.

Let my prayer be ever against their malice.
2738 2018-03-07 18:20:13 Solo una pregunta Lajous: si AMLO gana y llama a un plebiscito/constituyente estilo Venezuela, te vas a ir a vivir a Londres o a Estados Unidos?
2739 2018-03-07 18:20:05 #FunFact: #Solar energy, unlike oil, gas or coal, is inexhaustible. This green, #renewable energy source provides electricity, without impacting the environment.
2740 2018-03-07 18:19:59 stop using coconut oil on your DAMN   FACE
2741 2018-03-07 18:19:40 I really need to schedule an oil change 
2742 2018-03-07 18:19:38 When I was little my grandma told me that baby oil was made from children who didn't listen.
2743 2018-03-07 18:19:36 If olive oil is made of olives.. What is baby oil made of?

2744 2018-03-07 18:19:35 #CERAWeek turns red, with Exxon sharply down after unveiling a big spending increase to fill production growth gap, and #oil prices down too. #OOTT
2745 2018-03-07 18:19:33 If we could move oil by pipeline instead of rail, there might be more trains for grains.
2746 2018-03-07 18:19:19  Scorpio: Tomorrow Stella and oil run into the laxative but Elizabeth Swaney and your pet bedbug, Dave, stock the lake with wethers.
2747 2018-03-07 18:19:11 Actually depending on your skin type, cocunut oil on your face can do more harm than good.
2748 2018-03-07 18:19:01 今日は何オイルがいいかい?アロマオイルで香りたい?オリーブオイルでイタリアンたい?ふふふ…僕は君のためならどんなオイルにもなってやるさ…
2749 2018-03-07 18:18:59 Also saying that if you use oil you can't think it is bad it just short sighted. If you live in a western country you kinda have no choice
2750 2018-03-07 18:18:54 I’m also surrounded in nyc
2751 2018-03-07 18:18:51 Would be expecting this dip in oil to be bought - will have to see how much this recent down move has cleared out some weak longs - Chinese still +ing like going out of style, US inventories still drawing down (esp. Cushing) seaborne storage is reducing from an oversupplied state
2752 2018-03-07 18:18:50 Muy mal artículo de Krauze, quien se ha vuelto un golpeador a sueldo. Lo entiendo, yo también tendría miedo si llevara viviendo de amistades con el poder y la oligarquía medio siglo. No deja de darme lástima.

Meh...WTF, let's try them again while we have a stable genius, futuristic visionary leading us..and the brilliance of Steven Miller, WHAT could go wrong?
2755 2018-03-07 18:18:42 I can use coconut oil if u have it! Or even olive oil lol
2756 2018-03-07 18:18:31 WELCOME TO KENYA WHERE:
40 Billion cannot be accounted for
Head surgeries are done to wrong patients
Kalenjin mps are defending a Mrs Koros suspended for incompetence
Sodium hydroxide is used to preserve milk
Formalin is used to preserve meat
Transformer oil is used to fry
2757 2018-03-07 18:18:30 Most especially when there is oil or okro soup was inside
2758 2018-03-07 18:18:25 Tea Tree Oil or Cocoa Butter > Wave Grease
2759 2018-03-07 18:18:19 Oil down 2.84% today and USDCAD still can't break through 1.30... suggestive of oversold conditions.
2760 2018-03-07 18:18:10 Caramel, pop corn, deep frying oil, laughter and children's shrieks, the smell of the livestock animals, hot grease from a sausage, foam from a cold beer.
2761 2018-03-07 18:18:04 @BBCNews Wow, just wondering how much of that Beard Oil (when its washed off the Sports Presenter) is going to end up as a fatberg...
2762 2018-03-07 18:17:50 FINALLY getting a oil change  that light been on my dashboard forever !
2763 2018-03-07 18:17:36 Wow, Iknow right. Historic black unemployment, historic Hispanic unemployment, record low women's unemployment last 20years, stock markets gain over a trillion dollars, now the biggest oil producer in the world. Man, aren't you just so tired of WINNING, AND WINNING, AND WINNING
2764 2018-03-07 18:17:34 @maangchi Hi Maangchi! I have a question, what do you do with the oil after you have finished making the dish (e.g. fried chicken), do you throw it away or do you re-use it? Love your videos , thank you!
2765 2018-03-07 18:17:19 the body shops tea tree oil face wash got rid of all of my dark spots from scarring, and i usually take a dime sized amount of vitamin e and massage that into my skin for a “natural glow” 
2766 2018-03-07 18:17:16 Great day for the oil heater to stop working. 
2767 2018-03-07 18:17:10 Check your Engine oil this Sunday.
2768 2018-03-07 18:17:07 Not when they taste like burnt motor oil
2769 2018-03-07 18:17:07 Instead of limiting your belief to left versus right, you should think about what I said. There are many groups who would like to see Canadian Oil interests stagnant. Foreign oil interests are also subverting, that should be obvious. You always lose a war if u don't know enemies
2770 2018-03-07 18:17:05 Yea i used to say the same until it get clutch lol i still prefer the real tree. But the oil not bad at all for conveniency
2771 2018-03-07 18:16:51 So why is Prescription Omega 3 Fish Oil aka Omacor and Lovaza on the market?
2772 2018-03-07 18:16:42 Ah, that was already on track to happen. But you haven't screwed it up yet. Though you may, with steel tariff. Steel, you know, is needed to build oil rigs, which are needed for oil production. And oil is needed to power defense. So u'r actually harming national security.
2773 2018-03-07 18:16:37 Murphy Moment of the Day:

On the way to get an oil change, got pulled over b/c the officer thought my inspection sticker was overdue...because it's wonky from having my windshield broken TWICE.
2774 2018-03-07 18:16:32 Sir follow @syria_true ,she is my friend reporting from ground from #syria, this is just another plot of these wahaabi bastards to topple another shia ally of #Iran & have monopoly of the oil. Well,i guess you already know it.

2781 2018-03-07 18:16:02 Why did anyone believe a word? Norway has 9m. people and huge oil and gas reserves.

2785 2018-03-07 18:15:28 It will take the conservative way of life a hell of a lot longer to die off. Then it will them dying off in the Socialist system they are trying to push. Look at Venezuela world's richest oil Reserve 5 years ago.   now today  the citizens eating trash. #Resist lol
2786 2018-03-07 18:15:24 OPEC Secretary General Mohammed Barkindo asserts that the oil cartel’s ongoing efforts to limit global crude production, along w/ 11 non-OPEC countries, could serve as a long-term strategy to reduce boom-and-bust oil prices #Oil #OPEC #politics
2787 2018-03-07 18:15:10 The problem for industry, of course, is that the public interest groups are not trafficking in lies as are the oil and gas industry and its political shills, like @JustinTrudeau, @jkenney, @RachelNotley, and @LindaFrum.
2788 2018-03-07 18:15:01 If you like the taste of burnt motor oil
2789 2018-03-07 18:14:56 First lecture for Nutr Thera covers drug induced nutritent deficiencies, but thiamine deficiency from diuretics isn't mentioned only magnesium, potassium, & zinc. CoQ10 & fish oil when taken with diuretics can lower blood pressure & gingko makes some diuretics more effective.
2790 2018-03-07 18:14:38 Whites in power were often outnumbered by the people they harmed.
India (largely Hindu) and China (largely atheistic) have more slaves.
Are you referring to purchases of oil from Muslim countries? I'm not sure that Democrats can be held entirely responsible for those.
2791 2018-03-07 18:14:38 Anybody ever take fish oil supplements for their cholesterol? Has this helped?
2792 2018-03-07 18:14:26 Well now we know how NK paid for the oil from Russia.

You do know that Norway's oil is nationalized, right?

2798 2018-03-07 18:13:46 This will teach me to do my own #OilChange - @Walmart went in for an oil change and half the items weren't done but were checked off as complete SMH!
2799 2018-03-07 18:13:43 emulsify the two (use blender). start w a teaspoon or two. if u dont the oil will sit at the top & be gross. the oil essentially inhibits the caffine release so you feel the effects longer.
2800 2018-03-07 18:13:43 Forget oil shortage ... I’m raising awareness on sleep shortage .. it affects every single human lol we’d have a lot less problems if we all got more sleep ! #MoreSleep
2801 2018-03-07 18:13:33 Nigeria produce 3.5 mln bbl/day of oil. Look at the poverty level,90% people living in pitable condition; no food,no medicines,no hospitals,no jobs,agruiculture in doldrums.If west stops suporting corrupt regimes in Nigeria,there will be no Boko Haram.Its true for rest of Africa.

2810 2018-03-07 18:12:50 When we start bringing back our manufacturing, oil, steel, Make our own products, produce our own everything...We will become a rich nation again. We won't owe other countries. We will pay off our debt. We need to be proud of what we do as Americans again. We cheapened ourselves.
2811 2018-03-07 18:12:37 The treasury (and therefore iScot) doesn’t receive oil revenue. It receives (very little) tax on the profits generated by oil revenues. Swinney lobbied Osborne to reduce taxes on North Sea oil.
2812 2018-03-07 18:12:30 Just planted my ducks in oil
2813 2018-03-07 18:12:15 You can only have so many “long-term” big $ deals on your squad or you run risk of ongoing cap issues. The Oil have only 1 maybe 2 left with 97, 29, and soon 25. You don’t even have your clear #1 after next yr and $ will go up in crease Talbot or otherwise.

Why is it not devolved then Allan.
What will yer excuse be when WM fight to keep scots oil?
2817 2018-03-07 18:11:47 Baby oil and baby lotion mixed together is wonderful

2822 2018-03-07 18:11:12 1 of my personal festival pro tips: add a few drops of peppermint oil (or mouthwash in a pinch) to ur wipes to feel extra refreshed during ur baby wipe shower*

* = don't use these on ur genitals ... UNLESS ur into feelin like jack frost gargled ur balls  #babywipegang
2823 2018-03-07 18:11:11 Lotion should work pretty well if you have some! Also any kind of oil
2824 2018-03-07 18:11:06 Dad borrowed my car to run errands. He just came home w/a Pep Boys receipt & said he saw my oil was low/tires needed air, so he wanted to fix that. Dads, man.
2825 2018-03-07 18:10:47 Oil exports from Angola are slumping & IEA says aging fields + lack of interest from foreign investors mean the worst is yet to come. Shipments from the OPEC state will average 1.52 MMbopd in the January-April period #Oil #Angola #Africa #business
2826 2018-03-07 18:10:46 I like this thinking! How does it translate to policy? Especially with big oil, illegal forestation & the over mining of resources. Ex: No elected official has made a statement on the water contamination of Westley, Greyson and even Patterson. What would you do to protect #CA10?
2827 2018-03-07 18:10:37 Today, I'm serving up some cheerful, voluptuous, abdominal, condescending mustard oil realness.
2828 2018-03-07 18:10:33 I will see clearly o.. So I can tiptoe  to the kitchen, heat up groundnut oil then come back to the bed and pretend I didn't see clearly after I pour the oil on them......just saying.
2829 2018-03-07 18:10:30 I’m jus slicker than niggas like Olive Oil
2830 2018-03-07 18:10:22 Agree, we will see. However, as US production is increasing quicker than consumption in US, you can expect a big grow in oil exports. Therefore, it is not that strange that GC and inventories near ports will become much more important to store crude oil in the future.

2834 2018-03-07 18:09:42 I mean I wouldn’t suggest using cooking oil but y’know. it would probably work.
2835 2018-03-07 18:09:40 You're not part of the solution you are part of the problem, donny. When you try to cling onto old jobs that are dying out you aren't helping anyone. Especially when they are big oil and big coal. You are destroying the environment and lives. Your trade deals will also costs jobs
2836 2018-03-07 18:09:38 Doesn't being hydrated or crusty affect oil production thus affects acne ? I don't know wallah  EBP ya huda you need more than one journal to support your decision  *says so with having 0 evidence*
2837 2018-03-07 18:09:25 I want to learn how to cook palm oil stew. I mean, is it as straight forward as replacing groundnut oil with palm oil?
2838 2018-03-07 18:09:13 All my homies back home been working in them oil plants. Can’t smoke, but they on them 3 day drugs
2839 2018-03-07 18:09:09 I am guessing that that is because the main industry in Oklahoma is oil.

Although Swiss Author Daniel Odier lives there with his wife, Nell Gotkovsky, the Violin Virtuoso.   Brigham Young University.

Drove cross country. did not see one oil well in Oklahoma or Cow in Texas
2840 2018-03-07 18:09:06 First Nations folks will be paid off by the oil industry and it will all blow over. It's just a question of the amounnt of money and jobs. The industry has to do a better job of providing incentives. I mean why would the FN risk land, air and water unless they got long term jobs?
2841 2018-03-07 18:09:05 I am personally looking forward to crossing peak oil as it will provide the incentives for society to make these changes.
2842 2018-03-07 18:08:59 I could image we would be seeing a little bit more action in some oil / gas names in Canada if we had different government in power that wasn't driving away investment dollars
2843 2018-03-07 18:08:43 Are the starts the same? Were man city not taken over by the oil money a few years earlier than PSG?
2844 2018-03-07 18:08:40 weekly exfoliations with this spa salt i own. daily applications of coconut oil. lots of water. minding my business

2846 2018-03-07 18:08:28 You're probably fine. I like to get my oil changed at a dealership at least once a year. They check brakes, battery, etc beyond what quick lube places do.
2847 2018-03-07 18:08:20 I see Sergey Sirotkin found some more oil money...
2848 2018-03-07 18:08:19 WRONG! You dummy.
Here they are: Corn Flour, Sugar, Oat Flour, Brown Sugar, Palm and/or Coconut Oil, Salt, Reduced Iron, Yellow 5, Niacinamide*, Zinc Oxide, Yellow 6, Thiamin Mononitrate*, BHT (a preservative), Pyridoxine Hydrochloride*, Riboflavin*, Folic Acid*

.... delicious!
2849 2018-03-07 18:08:16 Risky idea for curing a cold: run a nice hot bath. Add olbas oil. Relax.
2850 2018-03-07 18:08:13 I get why Zinke is cozying up to the oil companies. I’m sure he’ll cash in. But elephant parts? Trying to understand the motivation for this one
2851 2018-03-07 18:08:03 Oil change and car wash today 
2852 2018-03-07 18:07:48 Because much of the U.S. natural gas comes because of oil production, "there's no amount of low price that can push that out of the market," Gentle said.

2854 2018-03-07 18:07:31 One is a mature industry that has been under robust supply/demand price pressure for a long time. Think oil is cheaper than water yet less plentiful. The other is an emerging industry that is not yet cost competitive and needs to drive costs out to become a real player.
2855 2018-03-07 18:07:31 So @SenAlexander and @SecretaryZinke have hatched a scheme to auction National Parks to #GOP lobbyist for oil and gas exploration disguised as a way to fix the backlog in maintenance proj in parks. Selling of public lands to hide failure of Congress and backhand deals for cash
2856 2018-03-07 18:07:17 Thank you for the retweet! You have reminded me I have run out of my Italian friends olive oil. It is from her dads farm. I wonder if she is planning on visiting soon :-)
2857 2018-03-07 18:07:14 Dropped in oil
2858 2018-03-07 18:07:11 @Bamabroker well done on that oil short call
2859 2018-03-07 18:07:03 coconut oil, Vaseline, basically anything oily will break down makeup
2860 2018-03-07 18:07:01 for sure.... the deeper they go, the stronger the walls need to be to provide enough push to withstand the water pressure. wonder how an oil rig miles off the coast gets built?
2861 2018-03-07 18:06:54 WM gave the oil companies a tax break!,they are actually paying companies to take the oil,,only country on the planet to do so
That's why  Allan,,mismanagement at its worst
2862 2018-03-07 18:06:41 Protecting minorities ALWAYS a great challenge of demos

Let's not toss in the demos towel bc some Arab countries have probs implementing

First, maybe let's hold some demo referendums to re-draw Arab borders

& let's w/draw military funding & oil budgets from Arab dictators
Then
2863 2018-03-07 18:06:36 Well Tom Brady had to choose between being a snake oil salesman or winning Super Bowls. And we know which one he chose.
2864 2018-03-07 18:06:28 First they  take the words " nation of immigrants" out of the mission statement of the Dept. Of Naturalization and Immigration, now this. Pruitt says Bible verses told him to mine coal and oil. What next?
2865 2018-03-07 18:06:28 You’d probably be helping her take that makeup off she has caked on her face looks like she has baby oil all over her 
2866 2018-03-07 18:06:26 @Trader_Bran Oil shorts not done yet.
2867 2018-03-07 18:06:15 The drive was worth it tho. Free oil change I have two more left.
2868 2018-03-07 18:06:06 I'm hella lazy so most of the time it's just sprinkling a little bit of shredded cheese, parmesan, and black pepper, and honestly, it's been a long time since I made this so I can't remember if I used olive oil or not.
2869 2018-03-07 18:06:01 Please tell me the CBD OIL didn’t do it?!?
2870 2018-03-07 18:05:54 You know this winter has been frigid cold when I've just gotten my second $1900.00 propane delivery of 2018. Switch to propane, they said, it's cheaper than oil. Yeah right. Thermostat is going to 58 now

2874 2018-03-07 18:05:42 what kiNd of oil though...
2875 2018-03-07 18:05:36 |Matoi continually relished every minute of eating croquettes swimming in oil from a pastel pink bento box, notwithstanding a whoreson's ear-splitting car exhaust resounding from a mile away. Senselessness is inescapable.|

2876 2018-03-07 18:05:33 Oklahoma City, an oil town, has the most freeway-lane-miles per car in the U.S., and one of the very worst mass transit systems. Urban planning around automobiles is no accident
2877 2018-03-07 18:05:30 #SouthSudan @oil money has never been used for funding civil war. Check your sources very well.
2878 2018-03-07 18:05:19 My diffuser just arrive from amazon, put some lavender oil in it, heavenly

Cut calories/add health benefits, eat sardines packed in olive oil/water not soybean/cottonseed oil.
2881 2018-03-07 18:04:55 This author is awesome. Can you mix oil and water? They have their separate identity. Hindu can celebrate Eid but for this you don't need topi. If u do that then Muslim should do tilak for Hindu festival. Have u seen this type of Muslim.  dumb fairytale author.
2882 2018-03-07 18:04:49 I should wash my hair today. Hot oil treatment and everything lol
2883 2018-03-07 18:04:37 Is a Dad even a Dad if he doesn’t remind you to get an oil change every 3 minutes?
2884 2018-03-07 18:04:34 A weld broke on the dry sump dry sump tank they said oil went everywhere.
2885 2018-03-07 18:04:23 i mean oil if you hate yrself
2886 2018-03-07 18:04:18 I don't have vapor rub stuff so I just put peppermint essential oil on my chest and liked, it helped, but it also got on my hands and like the area around my knuckles feels very weird and cold

2889 2018-03-07 18:04:02 My advice: more reading, less philosophizing. I didn't expect you to answer my questions anyway. FYI, Alberta oil much cleaner than the crap you import. Nevermind the huge carbon basin. Why do you think your air is clean? Magic? How do you get your oil? Also magic! Good Lord
2890 2018-03-07 18:03:56 What y'all know about coconut oil in your coffee? My doc suggested I give this a try, I'm a bit skittish.
2891 2018-03-07 18:03:54 Roast potatoes is dead simple, and easily varied: peel and slice potatoes (I like wedge-shapes), throw them on an oven tray with oil and a bit of butter, salt and season however you want. Roast in the oven at ~200C until golden and crispy. 

Eat with anything.
2892 2018-03-07 18:03:50 places that aren't gonna charge me $40 for an oil change. go!
2893 2018-03-07 18:03:38 US is becoming economically  self-sufficient in Oil/Steel/Aluminum for the first time in decades.  Get used to it.  A strong America means a safe and prosperous America and that is good for Hemispheric relations.
2894 2018-03-07 18:03:14 Yet over looks the cpc arrangements with ethical oil, Fraser inst, manning all funded in part by foreign $
2895 2018-03-07 18:03:13 Yes I. Waterproof makeup is a thing. Oil melts it away like ntn.
2896 2018-03-07 18:03:10 My oil change was cheap asf today  prolly cause i cut into them so bad last time
2897 2018-03-07 18:03:04 Weed stocks = overpriced, Bitcoin = downtrending so continued sell-off for the blockchains, Oil and Gas = cheap but still no love, Gold and Silver, it just doesn't look like its time yet, I have no idea where the DOW is going, directionless market, frustrating to say the least
2898 2018-03-07 18:02:57 Nobody else is protecting our interests. He is absolutely right to play hardball. Our country, loves to make money off Alberta. But nobody wants to help us. If BC is against us, then they’re against us. If they dont like our oil and gas, then they shouldn’t buy it from us.
2899 2018-03-07 18:02:53 And what oil Westminster steal from Scotland then you have noting. Brexit could very easily put an end to FS sector, Scotland will have another ref and take back the oil. And you will be left with 60% population non contributors... great idea let’s tax the 40
2900 2018-03-07 18:02:43 Tiny dental surgery is the mother of invention. In my quest for non-chew calories, I made up the pasta smoothie: leftover cold pasta casserole, tomato purée, olive oil, basil, scallion. Cold in blender. Chuggable. I'm taking this one to the nursing home one day.

2902 2018-03-07 18:02:37 The big thing is the oil. 1/4 cup is 4 Tbsp = ~ 20 points for the whole thing
2903 2018-03-07 18:02:27 Oh no Jude!  Please feel better. Try ice. Heat? Cannabis oil may be worth looking into if legal in your state. I also highly recommend seeing a naturopath doctor in addition to your Neuro docs. They have helped me immensely with my Lyme disease when no other Dr could.
2904 2018-03-07 18:02:26 Thanks to @SenateMajLdr the flood of rubles into America has reinvigorated our economy. No longer are oil and mining company executives hampered by the crushing weight of sensible foreign policy. Thanks, Mitch!
2905 2018-03-07 18:02:22 Also tuning in on the jergens. One of the only products that doesn’t make me orange. I don’t care for the smell though, so I add a few drops of essential oil.
2906 2018-03-07 18:02:17 How do you know they were from Iraq? Account I've heard it was led by opium warlords who saw an opening in oil in Iraq and then needed to invade Syria to get it to market in Turkey. You think Daesh leaders were about religion?
2907 2018-03-07 18:02:13 "Shaniseeee why u never told me to detangle with oil all this time?!?!?! "

WHOLE TIME I told this B about coconut oil from last year. Bye sis!!!
2908 2018-03-07 18:02:03 Wrap it in foil before checking her oil
2909 2018-03-07 18:02:00 No es pirinola. El cambio por sí mismo no es garantía. Con AMLO se brinca del sartén al fuego. Esa idea de que cualquier cosa nueva es buena es lo que metió a Venezuela en este pedote.

2914 2018-03-07 18:01:36 omg yes it fucking is!!! slightly frying the oats in coconut oil first? maybe add a sprinkle of cinnamon in at that early stage...
2915 2018-03-07 18:01:36 Rich oil scots? The big oil companies are owned by foreign investors. There is not one serious scottish oil company. If you are talking about the supply chain there are more local companies but they aren't the ones getting the tax breaks.
2916 2018-03-07 18:01:24 Whoever was the last person to replace the oil filter on the ambulance I just serviced needs to be throat punched with an ax.

2924 2018-03-07 18:00:52 But. But what about us?
2925 2018-03-07 18:00:19 @flyrobesupport is a fraud company. They deliver stain clothes and ruin your special occasions. It was my sister's wedding and they delivered oil stained Clothes. And failed to provide the replacement before the event. They did not even provide me any compensation.
2926 2018-03-07 18:00:18 This is idiotic

Iran elected a democratic leader in 53, & Britain & US deposed him bc oil

Most Arab countries aren't countries in the organic sense of Europe or N America - they are former Brit/French/etc controlled areas whose boundaries were decided in Europe

Egypt had 2 yrs
2927 2018-03-07 18:00:07 I take victories where I can, even small ones.

Which is why today I am celebrating my recent discovery that adding coconut oil to my oatmeal is everything.
2928 2018-03-07 18:00:05 Pretty sure when I was reading it, I smelled of patchouli oil and my idea of fashion was finding rainbow laces for my doc martins.
2929 2018-03-07 18:00:05 Commodities: Sugar -4.01%, Crude Oil -2.76%
2930 2018-03-07 18:00:02 Millenials are killing the oil industry
2931 2018-03-07 18:00:01 La "democracia" está amenazada pero no por la elección, sino por el propio sistema político. Desde el momento en que los intelectuales se vuelven golpeadores a sueldo del propio gobierno. AMLO es un peligro pero pensemos ¿por qué hemos orillado a la gente a considerar esa opción?
2932 2018-03-07 17:59:34 The problem is hitting the oil industry too and will probably continue. Without major pipeline expansion, well over a hundred unit trains will be needed to get western Canadian oil to tidewater in near future. Painted into a corner!
2933 2018-03-07 17:59:30 me: I wanna try new painting techniques like maybe get better at oil pastel or dry pastel oR COLOR PENCILS THATD BE COOL

also me as soon as I’m inspired to paint: so watercolors yeah??
2934 2018-03-07 17:58:49 someone needs to invent an expandable spatula so you can toss/turn/stir/flip whatever you’re cooking in oil
2935 2018-03-07 17:58:45 The government in Oklahoma is a joke. Big oil owns them. Whatever they say goes. Oklahoma teachers are among the lowest paid in the country.
2936 2018-03-07 17:58:39 @animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
2937 2018-03-07 17:58:38 @oil_shaeikh we need to leave naija oo
2938 2018-03-07 17:58:35 What are you talking about I have made literally millions of policy statements 1) implement the federal carbon tax.  2) protect the free market by interfering in it limiting the market for oil. 3) Shut down safe injection and have my brother cure them.  4)defund public schools.
2939 2018-03-07 17:58:33 The only ones who will really lose in having a cheaper Canadian dollar is the oil sands. I don't mind it because it's still better for everybody else. Lower dollar spreads benefits for the whole nation not just Alberta. Sometimes less is more.
2940 2018-03-07 17:58:28 Did you ever get what i told you to..  The CBD oil? It helps I'm telling you its works miracles! I swear on everything it's always helped for my headaches . Or go to the Dr. so you can see whats really going on with that...
2941 2018-03-07 17:58:09 AMEN...we do need to start spending money here for our infrastructure instead of rebuilding other nations who have oil money to do so themselves.
2942 2018-03-07 17:58:09 Hey give me fish fucking all day everyday. Lather me up with that fish oil. Fill me with those omega 3s
2943 2018-03-07 17:58:06 peppermint oil!
2944 2018-03-07 17:58:03 Useful? Castor oil is useful. Swashbuckling, better.
2945 2018-03-07 17:57:53 Do I need to be taking my car for maintenance check ups if there are no warning lights on and I’m getting on-schedule oil changes?
2946 2018-03-07 17:57:50 Saskatchewan news is rarely covered outside the province.  It's very frustrating. For years, .@PnPCBC interviewed brad wall cheerleading for oil, and NEVER talked to environmentalists, Indigenous leaders, opposition MLAs challenging his views.  Like his was the only opinion.
2947 2018-03-07 17:57:44 Your idea of subsidy may not be my idea of subsidy. Every time we pay for stuff for the oil and gas industry that is money that citizens don't get for continuing care and folks with disabilities. Why are we helping the richest corporations? Cuz politicians in pockets of oil
2948 2018-03-07 17:57:34 Price gouging by big oil.
2949 2018-03-07 17:57:28 Oil and Gas
2950 2018-03-07 17:57:27 Maybe if the obstruction by the Dems would approve trumps appointees we would be getting somewhere.

There is an economic reset in process.

By 2023 we will by the global Oil Exporter.

The dollars value is based on oil 

Aka petro dollar.

Go back to the kids table with ur BS
2951 2018-03-07 17:57:09 WTF?! He straight up lied. It was his grand dad who was the immigrant from Cuba. Cruz's dad is an engineer who worked in Oil his entire life.
2952 2018-03-07 17:57:08 Unsure why i should view "Christians" who oppose environmentalism&global warming SCIENCE b/c "god will provide"/"ENDTIMESRAPTURE!!" w/ any more respect than people who essentially say: Fuck the Planet—oil/deregulation makes "ME" Big Buck$ & I'll pretend we get jobs out of it.
2953 2018-03-07 17:57:07 a terrible oil smell keeps wafting in my window :/// still not as bad as whatever garbage strain of weed my neighbors smoke tho.
2954 2018-03-07 17:56:23 Especially when it is oil dirty 
2955 2018-03-07 17:56:22 I don't really know how to use oregano essential oil because I don't want my house to smell like a pizza. Patchouli is one thing because it's very Earthy and herbal, whereas oregano just serves full Italian Food Goddess pass the pepperoni pls.

2960 2018-03-07 17:55:24 I take a multivitamin, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin B12, fish oil, and green tea every day. 
2961 2018-03-07 17:55:24 1st boom in Trump’s tweet.  See Drudge BOOM report about USA oil that Trump retweeted.
2962 2018-03-07 17:55:23 At the same time, let's build double decker ocean freighters that can also carry raw logs, as well as that crude oil...at least then our shipbuilding industry may flourish once again...Oh wait, they would probably build those off shore too.

2965 2018-03-07 17:54:57 Glad that you're standing up for oil and gas.  So, what's Scheer saying about this ...silence is NOT golden.  Liberal media narrative is all negative in regards to Pres Trump which, is just another way of hiding the Liberal's mess and going after CDN Conservatives.
2966 2018-03-07 17:54:56 Yep - when you oil the snake it gets slippery
2967 2018-03-07 17:54:50 So my bike lock has been covered in oil for the past 2 days because the rain jammed it and I had to oil it so it could work again so essentially I’ve been arriving to class smelling like oil lol whazgud
2968 2018-03-07 17:54:41 I’m bout done with dan vaden. My whole day shouldn’t be sacrificed to get a oil change smh
2969 2018-03-07 17:54:41 Snow coming down good here, generator all set with new oil , spark plug , new battery! Hope I don’t need it again
2970 2018-03-07 17:54:38 Bill Nye is a actor, comedian, writer and makes a living being paid to pretend. Go look up his biography. Just a snake oil salesman who has fooled millions. Bill Nye represents big money who wants to push Cap & Trade-Carbon Credit Exchanges. A scam.

2975 2018-03-07 17:53:40 Only until my wife gets home. Then she'll turn it down because "heating oil doesn't grow on trees".
2976 2018-03-07 17:53:31 My hairdresser put some weird oil on my scalp and I've had this breeze-like sensation on my head since. 
2977 2018-03-07 17:53:26 Such simplification is irrelevant. We exist on diet of propaganda where we're always the good guys & real history shows thats just not true. Russia & china & terroists being enemy is good for military industrial profits, middle east / Venezuela has oil & anti US governments
2978 2018-03-07 17:53:13 Just wait till AB turns off the flow of oil to BC refineries....you ain’t seen nothing yet.

2982 2018-03-07 17:53:08 Putin stated that technological development is incredibly important for #Russian economics, and that, while Russia has oil, gas, metals and diamonds, it still needs a “spurt” to become one of the global technological leaders.
2983 2018-03-07 17:53:07 How would we make money on oil and gas by not supplying it?  Think about that logic.  Don't come back at me with a "he's playing hardball" because It's not his place to play hardball.
2984 2018-03-07 17:52:42 Friendly reminder that potatoes wedges dressed with Parmesan cheese and truffle oil should NOT be dipped in corn syrup masquerading as ketchup.
2985 2018-03-07 17:52:35 I do oppose fracking not because of Russia. It is because of BP and seeing how poorly the oil companies actually operate.

2988 2018-03-07 17:52:03 it’s either oil from your hair or stress sometimes it’s the food you eat that makes your forehead breakout.
2989 2018-03-07 17:52:03 Or is the water free? What about the water that is contaminated by the industry? What about the water that is diverted from agriculture and ranching to the industry? Water not oil is the most important resource in AB but folks are obsessed with the oil industry. Again so dumb.
2990 2018-03-07 17:51:59 Are these different kind of oil, compared the ones imported? Why not use domestic before importing?

3001 2018-03-07 17:51:06 #fsrs2018 FSRS project with DFO OCMD ecological knowledge for oil spill purposes now Guysborough to Cape St. Mary's. Hoping for 12 focus groups by the end of the year.
3002 2018-03-07 17:51:06 Good day but not excited about my oil change lol not tryna b waiting oh shit it’s Wednesday
3003 2018-03-07 17:51:00 Do you have an 'Oil Painting' setting on your phone?
3004 2018-03-07 17:50:27 Especially if it was used to store palm oil soup
3005 2018-03-07 17:50:18 อยากได้ Tarte Pure Maracuja Oil แต่ไม่ไหวกับกลิ่นอะ เขาใจนะว่า pure จริง แต่แบบ แงง ไม่ต้องขนาดนั้นก้ได้ ใส่อะไรดับกลิ่นมาให้หน่อย T_T
3006 2018-03-07 17:50:17 Do you use oil?
3007 2018-03-07 17:50:17 DaybyDay I appreciate your work. I don't know if you run MTF forecast for followers but if so I'd like to see an oil stock SM which has been very volatile.  Good trading stock.  Thank you.
3008 2018-03-07 17:49:51 Mr. Coyne, do you think that all opinions should be given equal public attention?

Should, for example, a biologist and a creationist be given equal credence when discussing evolution?

Is there no value in denouncing a snake oil salesman before he has time to charm a new mark?

3010 2018-03-07 17:49:41 Try looking at it this way. If China decides to stop selling us steel wtf is the USA going to do about it? We'd be fucked. Our dependence on China for steel has now put us in a vulnerable position.  libs say we went to Iraq for oil well where we going for steel if china stops?
3011 2018-03-07 17:49:38 Simply reclaiming the World’s largest oil spill.

3013 2018-03-07 17:49:20 y’all, please take care of your skin under your makeup. 

skincare is just as important. vitamin e oil, jojoba and rosehip work wonders.

3017 2018-03-07 17:48:44 I can't help wondering whether she was deaf & blind at the time of this "sexual relationship" because even back *then* the Orange Horror was no oil painting & no great wit.

According to her, she didn't want him to pay her either (though we may take that with a pinch of salt).
3018 2018-03-07 17:48:41 Or the fact that the smell can make other people sick. I like marijuana, but don't use it because it makes me sick to my stomach. I do use CBD oil and it helps tremendously with anxiety, sleep hormones, etc. No high or tummy issues! :)
3019 2018-03-07 17:48:39 If oil dropped back under $40, $XOM would be at 26 year lows
3020 2018-03-07 17:48:24 Dead ass have to pay 44 dollars for an oil change cause my car 
3021 2018-03-07 17:48:23 There are probably a couple poor dead kids who, in hindsight, would've rather rolled the dice with an armed 4th period AP Bio teacher than tweet tearful goodbyes as the shots got closer.
3022 2018-03-07 17:48:17 I just do extra label reading. I remember how much I love animals and why I became vegan and still am so leaving out foods with the oil is much easier.
3023 2018-03-07 17:48:12 In 2013,Nigeria ranked fourth in global crude oil supply outages.
3024 2018-03-07 17:48:11 I believe the opium fields in Afghanistan were quieter for a while when oil not opium became the best gig in the region for gangsters using gullible 'freedom fighters' as cover for large scale plunder of valuable assets from oil to antiquities.

3029 2018-03-07 17:47:09 Y’all might as well drop some cooking oil cause I’m ready to buy it by the case at this point 
3030 2018-03-07 17:46:53 How?
3031 2018-03-07 17:46:49 lamp oil. rope. bombs.
3032 2018-03-07 17:46:44 To mine understanding - like how a car needs change of oil once in a while to enable it work properly - if i believe don't get checked the oil might lose its function...
3033 2018-03-07 17:46:37 Work it out OIL

3042 2018-03-07 17:45:31 Energy stocks sell off sharply after oil prices drop
3043 2018-03-07 17:45:30 Needs juuust a touch of olive oil
3044 2018-03-07 17:45:30 Yes---an oil man who was given the highest medal in Russia by Putin is not a person you can trust for a thousand reasons.
3045 2018-03-07 17:45:18 The UK produces half the amount of oil that Norway does and has 13 times the population
3046 2018-03-07 17:45:14 Untilll then I guess I’ll be waiting 45min to an hr every time I need a oil change 
3047 2018-03-07 17:44:47 "Now, I am listening to the Doors. I really should oil the hinges..."
3048 2018-03-07 17:44:45 Guy at the oil change place keeps singing Ed Sheeran songs and tbh he kind of looks like a more blond Ed and it’s freaking me out
3049 2018-03-07 17:44:44 That’s why I need a man to change my oil at home an I wouldn’t have to come to this place
3050 2018-03-07 17:44:43 I'm guessing you're making a cleaner version of commercial Caesar salad dressing, I'm Mexican and I've always used 3 minutes boiled eggs, bacon, anchovies, lime juice, "Maggie's juice" seasoning and olive oil for dressing the lettuce and garlic rubbed croutons
3051 2018-03-07 17:44:33 Getting an oil change should not take this long
3052 2018-03-07 17:44:29 A sharp decline in oil prices in international markets could help us a lot.
3053 2018-03-07 17:44:28 So it's clear you are talking about olive oil... cheers

3055 2018-03-07 17:44:26 Still no in court discussion of Governor's move to bar rate increase needed by PREPA because of increase in cost of oil. Puerto Rico cannot control the price of oil and without oil PREPA cannot make electricity.
3056 2018-03-07 17:44:03 Will, stop with these divisive politics. He never was dirt poor. His parents owned a seismic oil drilling analytics firm in Alberta. You are still just shaming immigrants.

3058 2018-03-07 17:43:49 What a boilermaker does is rebuild power plans, steel mills , oil refineries, nuclear plants. We rebuild them or build them from the ground up so we relay on coal and blast furnices to make our living so yes I vote we need coal firing boilers and furnices
3059 2018-03-07 17:43:48 Weekly goal: eat so much chick fil a that peanut oil comes out of my pores instead of sweat 
3060 2018-03-07 17:43:43 These are the people we need out of the party. Establishment buffoons, who have no plan. Just a diluted sense  of what seems to be a movement forward, unfortunately little changes. Something like, we’ll fund the National Parks with oil money while we open them to destruction.
3061 2018-03-07 17:43:41 Is DC really that much oil still?

3065 2018-03-07 17:43:06 The one thing missing from this list is how many birds are killed from Human Pollution including Oil Spills. Also,  how many die from swallowing the chewing gum humans throw on the ground? I love Birds, but doesn't stop them from dive bombing into my windshield on occassion.
3066 2018-03-07 17:43:05 Oh man. Before I had to go gluten free my bread machine was my favorite kitchen toy. I had a rosemary-Italian seasoning-olive oil bread recipe that was just the best. Made it constantly!
3067 2018-03-07 17:43:03 Although, I must say that I know some exceptions to this rule. @EliLake is one of those exceptions.
3068 2018-03-07 17:42:55 California produces 2/3 of the nations nuts and fruit and 1/3 of the vegetables. California needs it' farm workers that have lived here for generations to get food to your table. It is also the 3rd highest producer of oil. Think about that.
3069 2018-03-07 17:42:50 Maybe if we could get 3-4 million "Citizens" to travel to #California and pretend they are illegals and vote in state elections, maybe we could take the state out of the hands of the left sided idiot oil drinkers? Just thinking out loud b/c they need help so badly. #BlueStateRed
3070 2018-03-07 17:42:42 Still?! Damn sis. Did you get some sweet oil?
3071 2018-03-07 17:42:39 Should she not have links with Saudis, UK might probably save thousands if not millions of lives. It just irked me that the leader of one of the most established democratic country is praising the wahhabists, cruel and backward thinking royal regime leader. #Money and #Oil talks!
3072 2018-03-07 17:42:31 Castor oil! Chug chug bihhhh
3073 2018-03-07 17:42:25 I remember when asking an oil change included the air filters being changed as well. Nah, not anymore. The air filters cost more than the oil change does now. This car got a lot of nerve.  
3074 2018-03-07 17:42:25 I need to get an oil change my damn self.. next appt was for today actually
3075 2018-03-07 17:42:23 I had 10 bottles of Hempworx CBD oil on Monday, down to 2! Glad another delivery will arrive today!
3076 2018-03-07 17:42:20 What a bunch of idiots. I just started using CBD oil about 10 days ago. It works as good if not better than hydrocodone without the opioid side effects.
3077 2018-03-07 17:42:17 I really hate waiting to get my oil changed likeeee 
3078 2018-03-07 17:42:15 In Global Gas panel at #CERAWeek18, Tellurian Chair Charif Souki talks about accessing the surplus gas that will be coming from Permian. Says finding markets for the gas is critical to allowing oil production

3081 2018-03-07 17:41:58 Yesterday I bought an extractor & scraped every inch of my face & got rid of all the gunk. This morning I exfoliated & lathered my face in coconut oil. Tryin to get that new glowy skin in time for spring.
3082 2018-03-07 17:41:49 And for God's sake, Media, send your people to a basic gun class.

3085 2018-03-07 17:41:17 @SecretaryZinke Did you really say that your agency needs 2 team up with oil & gas companies 2 drill on public lands? And that regulations that make it inconvenient should be changed? I do not understand how that helps future generations of Americans. #Trying2StayTheLastBestPlace
3086 2018-03-07 17:41:11 As long as they are a major oil supplier they can do whatever the fuck they want. No one will put any pressure to reform their laws. Plus USA are up their holes too.
3087 2018-03-07 17:41:05 Welcome to Trump's Nazi Germany government requiring auto shops when you have an oil change or anything done take a picture of your vehicle check your mileage and your VIN number
3088 2018-03-07 17:41:01 Wow still pushing this propoganda ok here's some common sense if more women went into maybe trades oil and gas industry or other dangerous work instead of cutting hair and selling makeup they would make the same as any guy
3089 2018-03-07 17:40:54 "drowning in oil"?  Interesting claim.  Data says otherwise.
3090 2018-03-07 17:40:45 BC will take more oil from Alberta! The NDP does not want to deal outside of Canada. We have enough energy here right in Canada. Where's our National Energy Program Jason Kenney?
3091 2018-03-07 17:40:39 lol just go e85 and your car will be safe and faster, also make sure to check oil often and dont use a OTS map from cobb 
3092 2018-03-07 17:40:36 According to @jeremycorbyn “millions are at risk of starvation” in Yemen due to military action by Saudi Arabia 

Funny how he has not said anything about the oil rich Venezuelans going down the same route due to socialism

3095 2018-03-07 17:40:09 Hour wait for an oil change..smh
3096 2018-03-07 17:39:58 It amazes me that BC opposes oil yet they have been polluting the Ocean for decades.  Victoria still flushes raw sewage into the Pacific and fish farms strip the Ocean floor as well as farmed fish have escaped and mated with wild fish.  Ppl in glass houses shouldn't throw stones
3097 2018-03-07 17:39:55 Agreed.  Sadly our governments seem only to have the political will to build pipelines for oil when what we need is the political will to build pipelines for life giving water.  That's why we need candidates like you! #GPO2018

3100 2018-03-07 17:39:42 No currency can overthrow the USD from reserve status without dethroning the US Navy from reigning all oceans. Gold and oil contracts are secondary and of narrow view. Global trade takes place cos the US Navy allows it to happen. And it can be selective. Not on/off switch.
3101 2018-03-07 17:39:36 I mean it's bad enough AER is creating a lake district out of tailings for our kids but now to pay for the orphan wells that we're already subsidizing with a loan and int payment. This sucks. Big time. I mean we like oil but not the costs of oil. I'd say oil industry needs work.
3102 2018-03-07 17:39:36 Extra virgin olive oil?
3103 2018-03-07 17:39:33 Sure but it'll have to wait a bit, It's not a quick discussion.

In the meantime consider how Kenney threatening to shut off the flow of oil and gas to BC is in Alberta's best interest.
3104 2018-03-07 17:39:32 The other day my dad called me bitchin cause my sister told him i needed tires and he’s like go get tires Courtney. So then i texted my sister like wtf. She said I’m looking out for you. Well guess what Nicole i also need an oil change and my windshield is cracked.
3105 2018-03-07 17:39:29 Cualquier persona normal que le debe $1.000 pesos a la AFIP le llegan cartas documentos, juicios, etc... Cristobal Lopez debe $17.000.000.000 a la AFIP con su empresa OIL, y hace poco salió a luz. Como se nota lo que es estar junto con un gobierno eh.
3106 2018-03-07 17:39:17 Oil would want to at this stage however there s little planned until the 2022 (?) Capline reversal. If TMX is build the setup changes significantly.
3107 2018-03-07 17:39:01 Fvck Ted Rafael Cruz and everything he stands for! If Texans elect this POS to Senate it tells me all I want know about that state! Secession is a good answer for you! U can eat ur oil in ten yrs as sun powers the world but u can keep all guns and kill each other for 2nd Am! Bye!
3108 2018-03-07 17:38:59 Have you tried using pure peppermint essential oil?

3111 2018-03-07 17:38:37 It tastes like the oil that sundried tomatoes sit in  Hope it works for me x
3112 2018-03-07 17:38:34 Oil not "running out". Prices will always flucuate. Paula's comment relevant. Reserves show +40.We do not have to take on Euro for a number of years. Some countries have not. Re Euro, my business operates in Euro without any prob. Rep of Ireland oper in Euro no prob #toomuchfear
3113 2018-03-07 17:38:30 Placard 1267 is "petroleum crude oil"
3114 2018-03-07 17:38:17 I don't see RYAN ZINKE and the DOI, who wants offshore drilling and the destruction of public lands to produce oil, gas, coal, uranium,... Better also add the USFWS for their approval of trophy hunting of threatened elephants and lions.

3117 2018-03-07 17:38:03 If @POTUS had his way, #Utah would have no more national parks.  They’d all be oil fields or some other means of generating more wealth for his band of ever-greedy billionaires.

3120 2018-03-07 17:37:26 I don't think folks are saying that they can do without oil. I think they are saying that based on the record of best in the world regulations in AB with poor oversight and no penalties there is reason for caution in having increased oil movement in BC. Can't blame them. Redwater

One government oil company put up a board PURE FOR SURE at Company owned pump. Does it mean that other pumps do not supply pure.?

3127 2018-03-07 17:37:10 Wrong. Even the bolsheviks knew this. Ceding the state apparatus locks in catastrophic climate change and structural violence. The IMF, world Bank, and oil industry determine the lives of billions of people. We can completely decarbonize the economy with state control.
3128 2018-03-07 17:37:04 Friends of Science includes a number of P. Engineers, some are patent holders, inventors of new tech. Very capable of assessing what is 'real' disruption and what is cosmetic.  Cellphones are handy but these are cosmetic 'disruptions' to telecom industry - not to oil and gas. 2/

3131 2018-03-07 17:36:29 Not an Rx recommendation but if we're talking reducing pill burden, removing NHPs that may actually be harmful for patients (such as fish oil taken concurrently with warfarin and the risk of increased bleeding - especially in cancer patients)
3132 2018-03-07 17:36:23 i asked shorty for vinegar and oil on the side .....she really closed my chicken wrap and put it on the side of my sandwich

3135 2018-03-07 17:35:54 I dont know why I am laughing cos that is fucking sad that you think resource rich scots need bailed out by a country with no oil or gas like I said in the future your kids wont thank you for selling scotland out to westminster
If we gave WM oil we would be indy by friday
3136 2018-03-07 17:35:38 did u see oil 62.58 to 60.58 exactly $2.  I keep saying while the rest of the worls wastes its time ( including me) on calculating Fibs ; rsi ; etc..etc.. THESE guys mkt mkrs and splst they buy and sell and buy in terms of quarter half $1 $5 ..etc. simple no Phd required

3153 2018-03-07 17:33:44 So I've just started using CBD Oil for my anxiety and PoTS. I think I'll do a review of it in the next few weeks to let you guys know how I'm getting on. 

Just an FYI: It's the most disgusting thing I've ever tasted.
3154 2018-03-07 17:33:41 Switch from vegetable oil to coconut oil for cooking. It has a lovely flavour. #win #britishpieweek
3155 2018-03-07 17:33:33 I mean what is the "Friends of Science" when you aren't able to see the disruption ahead? I'm able to see this. Why not the @OilGasCanada ?I'm guessing that change is hard for the oil industry. But change now or it's bankruptcy. And we get stuck with Redwater decision liabilities
3156 2018-03-07 17:33:20 Oil and stocks have been highly correlated lately. Still makes no sense for Oil to plunge here, usually uncertainty will drive the price higher. Especially when it involves one of the world biggest producers talking tariffs. Guess we will find out Thursday what the markets thinks
3157 2018-03-07 17:33:19 Apologies me my English is just born by iPhone corrector .. I meant what do you suspect for oil prices till June?
3158 2018-03-07 17:33:18 It’s so GOOOOD. I use the deep pore cleanser, the treatment gel before bed and then the oil control lotion before my primer and stuff. I haven’t tried the scrub because I’m skeptical about face/body products but since you’ve had a good experience with it, i might try it!

3165 2018-03-07 17:32:39 I just improvised. Mixed greens, chicken breast cooked in a little bit of sesame oil, green onions, sliced almonds, wontons & a sesame ginger dressing
3166 2018-03-07 17:32:25 I don't know about this. The fact is that oil production is increasing thanks to the Trump guy but I kind of doubt that consumption is increasing. But of course there may be a war and this will change the situation. I find that it is best for me not to review non-scientist data.
3167 2018-03-07 17:32:10 The Only Ones Who Give A Fig What BadPlasticSurgery @TomiLahren Says, Are The Same UN-Educated Racists That Buy From Snake Oil Salesman
3168 2018-03-07 17:32:10 Why don't they name the roads through the future oil rigs and mines of Bear's Ears this instead?
3169 2018-03-07 17:32:05 I wish my luck would change, no central heating because oil won’t be delivered until 16th, had logs delivered today then discovered the wood burner had broken so have to wait for a part to be delivered. Luckily my neighbour has brought in 2 heaters for me & will fix the fire.Phew

3178 2018-03-07 17:31:18 OK do you think if England has massive oil and gas resrves they would ever accept a deal that left them with 8% of it?
You are deluded RICHY,,scots are resource rich,England is not,they take 92% and you believe them when they say scots r skint
3179 2018-03-07 17:30:57 Can you paint me the sun oil?や
3180 2018-03-07 17:30:55 This Saudi Barbarian is just another politician. Say what people want to hear, and then do whatever they want to do. Once their oil isn't needed, they'll be just like Pakistan.
3181 2018-03-07 17:30:52 Jeesus. Corbyn has raised human rights issues iran in parliament more than any other MP ever aprt from only 3 others. That's a fact, not that you'll care. You know nothing about the economic sanctions on Ven so UK an US companies can STEAL their oil. WAKE UP, you're brain-washed
3182 2018-03-07 17:30:50 re: Bill Nye.  Problem is that I haven't heard crap from Scheer about this ...guess Scheer is ok with what Nye-Trudeau say.  In fact, I haven't heard Scheer really go after Trudeau on oil and gas.  Media narrative still ignoring Liberal mess but ok to can go after Pres Trump.
3183 2018-03-07 17:30:47 In other news, I've been rubbing lavender oil on my pillows before I go to bed, and I'm 90% sure I've been getting 7 hours of straight REM sleep. That coupled with my diffuser and I've never slept better. #lifechanging

3188 2018-03-07 17:30:12 Got to love the hypocrisy, afraid of marijuana and cannibis oil but they will put alcohol dispensaries everywhere and use our money to do it. Don’t drink and drive children but if you do buy your booze from the State.
3189 2018-03-07 17:30:11 I don’t do deserve my papa. He’s the sweetest man alive. He took me to my eye appointment so I could get my car serviced. And as if that didn’t help me out enough, he paid for my eye exam, contacts, and oil change

3198 2018-03-07 17:29:27 Can you paint the sun oil?
3199 2018-03-07 17:29:23 I would drive around the state to avoid driving on a road named after the most corrupt president in our nation's history, especially after that president lifts protections in favor of oil and gas drilling on those sacred lands.
3200 2018-03-07 17:29:20 It takes oil to make the products that produce green energy.
3201 2018-03-07 17:29:16 Do you not think its a bit rich to take 92% of our oil then tell us they are bailing scots out,,if we stop them taking that 92% WE WILL NEED NOTHING FROM THEM
Do you agree that if westminster loses that 92% they will be worse off?
3202 2018-03-07 17:29:13 Everything is down. Stocks, Gold, Silver, Oil.  Money is moving out and being held on the sidelines.
3203 2018-03-07 17:28:56 The amount of oil my forehead produces in one day...could easily be used to fry up some food
3204 2018-03-07 17:28:50 He shoulda brought that up after break up not now. It’s time to put some aloe Vera and coconut oil on that wound n go on. Never keep talking u never know if you blocked ur chance.
3205 2018-03-07 17:28:42 Depends on consistency & HP of equipment; a lot of light fluffy stuff - 1 pass. Wet slushy stuff, prob > 1 pass throughout the storm. Either way I vegetable oil spray the blades & chute. Hydrophobic life.
3206 2018-03-07 17:28:37 Copying Alex Jones' every move, man, I dunno, doesn't feel very Alpha or very Gorilla to me. But I guess if a guy's got a cupboard full of snake oil then a snake oil salesman he becomes, right?

3208 2018-03-07 17:28:24 My point was more about the predicted diminishing importance of oil, rather than establishing a monopoly on water.
3209 2018-03-07 17:28:11 Like them giving N Korea oil. You are a fool!
3210 2018-03-07 17:28:09 Best bet is to keep raising your stoplosses slowly as the trade keeps going your way... I don't think today is the day to bail out of any gold or oil shorts or vix longs. Just my opinion..

3215 2018-03-07 17:27:35 Sadly, our government's climate policies are far to the right of Big Oil, which mostly backs C price, CH4 control, and CCS.
3216 2018-03-07 17:27:34 .@Ford Thank you for having your team reach out to me. I appreciate you taking the time to listen & hopefully we have good news soon!! Maybe a free oil change after this wait?!

I was labour for 30 years,that should worry you
3231 2018-03-07 17:24:38 you do realize that if They begin Fracking for Oil at borders of Yellowstone National Park,.... it would be BAD... very BAD. 
Please stop this Maddness now... implore your fellow senators that this situation is so Dire NOW with #climatechange & #Trump its End of the World, now...
3232 2018-03-07 17:24:33 Good acknowledgement of the power of people coming together to fight destructive infrastructure (even if it has permits). But I wonder if you've forgotten that Kinder Morgan is a US company in your quoting of Krause - or that Krause is funded by Big Oil. Seems like a big omission
3233 2018-03-07 17:24:30 Pull up to take 5 if you need a oil change . Fastest oil change in the planet  
3234 2018-03-07 17:24:26 Lots of people think that oil is the worst problem in the ocean. But is everyone overlooking the real problem? Overfishing.

3236 2018-03-07 17:24:21 Costs $108.00 to fill up in BC but only $53.80 in Bellingham ($.74/Ltr) Nobody puts the Oil Company’s feet to the fire. Simple gouging in Vancouver. Even Winnipeg is in the dollar range.  Big border line ups. Hard on our economy.
3237 2018-03-07 17:24:17 I just realised I'm the only illustrator in my sculpture class. Everyone else is an oil painting major 
3238 2018-03-07 17:24:15 Such as: letting LGBTQ marry, or  smoke a plant, having a free and open internet, living green, kneeling against police brutality, protesting against oil pipelines, the NRA, and endless wars?

Perhaps if elected officials listened to their constiuents this would be true.

3254 2018-03-07 17:22:22 On second thought. I wasn't watching, but just saw that drop. Still not sure what is the driving what. Could still be oil caused the plunge, not the other way around. Not so sure it's about fear, Gold usually goes much higher when there is fear. Stocks selling off for a month now
3255 2018-03-07 17:21:59 Big Oil was the first thing I thought of.

But you’ve got at admit, replacing the Champions League trophy with a legit “crown of spikes” would be the best move CONCACAF could ever make.
3256 2018-03-07 17:21:57 Hmm I don’t think so. Was almost like mashed potato, loads of garlic and olive oil.
3257 2018-03-07 17:21:49 Y did ur Admin argue that patents are "public grant" in the Oil States case before SCOTUS? The taking of US IP by hi-tech companies has done irreparable damage to US innovation. U want #MAGA u need to lead the charge & make sure the IP laws protect inventors not infringers.
3258 2018-03-07 17:21:47 Tea tree oil has been one of the best purchases i’ve done in my whole life.

3267 2018-03-07 17:20:22 Yup, 34k in Germany, 44k in Japan, 23k in Korea, and 11k in Italy.  Huge oil producers
3268 2018-03-07 17:20:19 Oil change then Houston bound! 
3269 2018-03-07 17:20:13 Could be a logo for an oil company, or a sunflower oil. Means nothing.
3270 2018-03-07 17:20:11 @realDonaldTrump are you proud? not only are you ruining this country, but the world...what the fuck is wrong with you. you could use the sun, wind for power, but no, lets continue with gas and oil...YOU ARE DISGUSTING, A PIECE OF SHIT...
3271 2018-03-07 17:20:05 Dana Loesch is a huckster, snake oil saleswoman whose pitch is for sale to the highest bidder. Talk about a phony.
3272 2018-03-07 17:19:49 Find a trade man, not even pipe line or oil field. There’s a lot out there. No college education making damn good money no debt.
3273 2018-03-07 17:19:46 Some people CAN'T see past "OIL"? Energy?  Narrow view!

Start with FOOD!  (Arable Farm Land, and usable water!?)

Then WHAT do we REALLY need to buy?  Work from there..

3276 2018-03-07 17:19:24 But that wasn’t a 'loss' was it? Our oil stocks were deliberately sold for loot, and at a loss too. But they put up the price of petrol and a levy too, just for more loot and to fund their election campaign

3282 2018-03-07 17:18:47 Money and oil talks; always has and always will do. Hypocrisy, hypocrisy and more hypocrisy. Grandiose words about principles and the fight against terrorism disappear into the ether for the sake of lucre and black gold.

3283 2018-03-07 17:18:47 That's insulting to those of us who bang other dudes. I wouldn't go near any of them.
3284 2018-03-07 17:18:45 Low population countries high in intellectual assets and oil (Norway) would do well with socialism and thrive with capitalism. Highly populated countries with no intellectual assets nor oil would collapse under socialism but would do well under capitalism.
3285 2018-03-07 17:18:41 Your scottish and you are siding with people who take 92% of scots oil revenue then tell us /you that you are skint and need a hand out!
Yer bairns wont thank you for giving away their prosperous future to WM who have bankrupted an oil rich country,,think on that

3289 2018-03-07 17:18:30 And who’s back yard would you prefer to drill in, Diane. California has a great thirst for petroleum products, where is it to come from. Maybe the oil companies should just turn off the spigot to California, then you and your armed security could walk.
3290 2018-03-07 17:18:13 Nae paprika or olive oil.

We are truly in "The cupboard was bare" territory here, not the usual "There's nothing for eating" exaggeration.

3292 2018-03-07 17:18:10 why don't they just say, "we promise to buy $1Billion more of oil from you instead of other sources"  Done.  Goods trade deficit goes down a billion.

China's aggregate balance: unchanged
US manufacturing: unchanged

real impacts: likely none

3298 2018-03-07 17:17:48 there's currently no clear, precise, accurate records of daily, weekly, monthly oil liftings in nigeria;
the statistics are so variegated!!
3299 2018-03-07 17:17:47 I’ve had this hot oil treatment in since yesterday morning  I’m next level lazy 
3300 2018-03-07 17:17:37 @JordanTishlerMD I use CBD oil 40-70 mgs per day with my low dose opioids (forced tapering due to law) and it helps tremendously. It helps with brain fog and mood and energy as well. Some brands work better than others. And it doesn't work for all but I know people it works for.
3301 2018-03-07 17:17:37 Been there, done that! Haha, it's not that bad really. Except in my case the guy had a hard time because my dumb ass likes to use body oil after I shower so his fingers kept slipping and it took several tries

3304 2018-03-07 17:17:22 oil  down $2.00
3305 2018-03-07 17:17:04 Apply lotion or body oil while your body is still damp. This will make your skin softer and smoother.
3306 2018-03-07 17:17:00 Does this come in oil painting? I want to post on my office wall here at Initech.. I can hear the bulls crying in their cubicles, better tell Nina to shut my door
3307 2018-03-07 17:16:51 I agree.  As a SF Giants fan, I witnessed first hand last season what happens when the bulk of your key players have lousy seasons.  Key moves by the Giants in the off-season and bounce back years from key players should turn it around.  Oil could do the same.
3308 2018-03-07 17:16:43 Off the top of my head. A fishing boat employs crew, pays fuel, food stores, fishing gear, oil, welding, engineers, electricians, harbour dues, sales commission, processing, transportation, lighthouse dues, mca surveys, stability surveyors, compass adjusters.. I could go on
3309 2018-03-07 17:16:33 I'm going to attempt to not eat salt, oil or sugar for 30 days. I don't need to diet. I"m not longer a big fat guy thanks to plant based eating and DDP yoga. However I feel i could do better. I have a serious salty snack and oil addiction. So starting today I'm doing this.
3310 2018-03-07 17:16:30 Pake nr aloevera + olive oil yg 100% murni, di aku sih worth bgt hehehe
3311 2018-03-07 17:16:23 I enjoyed your hyperbole. I'd rather sell to fellow Canadians, but they just want the net profit. I guess you're not above those living off the avails of the sinister "tar"sands. You missed my point, my friend. Are you using crude oil products? Is that oil cleaner?
3312 2018-03-07 17:16:08 Don't beat around the bush, burning of coal and oil doesn't increase methane levels! And atmospheric GHG represent only a tiny fraction of all GHGs superabundant in the soil and in the oceans! BTW, did u notice there is also a correlation of CO2 and the destroyed rainforests?
3313 2018-03-07 17:16:08 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, and open borders.
3314 2018-03-07 17:16:08 Parboil it then fry it up in olive oil with some salt, pepper and paprika.
3315 2018-03-07 17:16:07 Thank you I’ll have to try that one! I used butter, coconut oil, almond milk, vanilla extract, and organic honey. It wasn’t bad, just different lol and I feel amazing!
3316 2018-03-07 17:16:04 ok...well dont go hiding with Derek, your opinion is still valued by Heid.
3317 2018-03-07 17:16:01 He wanted the oil prices to go up and make us more dependent in domestic sources of petroleum. Bush had stock in us oil companies.  Former governor of texas. Plus Cheney's companies were awarded the contracts to get the Iraq oil fields working again
3318 2018-03-07 17:16:01 You strike Oil yet? Diggin hard n deep for Dirt @NBCNews
3319 2018-03-07 17:15:59 The little 1mL plastic measuring syringes oil companies give you are such garbage.
3320 2018-03-07 17:15:56 Making my own sweet potato fries with olive oil, paprika and a pinch of cinnamon. It would go well with this pie too actually!
3321 2018-03-07 17:15:52 We’re gonna pretend the 2.5 hour wait was the reason i left the oil change place and not the fact i basically tried to give myself an oil change 
3322 2018-03-07 17:15:51 Did you try giving cod liver oil?
3323 2018-03-07 17:15:44 @ACMBCT2 pls take in consideration of canteen cleanliness, food quality especially the rancid oil which stinks so bad. Please, request.
3324 2018-03-07 17:15:43 I think we can agree a bit in your point especially since outs being revealed about Trump's now connecting with the Oil barons of the Middle East he buddied up to on his visit. First Russia now this. The GOP picked a gem!
3325 2018-03-07 17:15:43 Those things happened after we joined though. Ending of US support for Bretton Woods 1971, Yom Kippur War 1973 and subsequent 'oil shock' probably led to economic turbulence.
3326 2018-03-07 17:15:40 bring me some oil pens 
3327 2018-03-07 17:15:30 @JhaSanjay which we’ll oil campaign you r taking about to destroy REAL Indian history ? The same history Nehru and his goons wrote by paid historians from JNU professors and Ram Guha? We know that u guys r the best in rewriting history
3328 2018-03-07 17:15:25 Why does my oil for painting says i cant drink it u know i cant resist myself syusaiidie
3329 2018-03-07 17:15:20 There must be some oil there.
3330 2018-03-07 17:15:20 Why is there only 1 hair store that has my hair oil in all of Conway but a $5 card min. And of course it won't come up to that and i don't have cash 
3331 2018-03-07 17:15:16 If the world is innovating out of a dependency on the oil industry we can't stick to old ways in AB. Unless we want to pay for the revenue generated by the oil industry? Best for our kids to do non-oil industry work. Best for families to dec consumption. Best to change as world.

3337 2018-03-07 17:14:40 It might sound nasty but I mixed Virgin olive oil, egg, mayo w/ it.
3338 2018-03-07 17:14:38 Red Robin and then to get Zach’s oil changed
3339 2018-03-07 17:14:37 I can’t wait to be oiled up in some coconut oil aaalllll summer.
3340 2018-03-07 17:14:32 I got hospitalized with a sinus infection and the only thing the doctor could do for the pressure was give me a nasal spray (sudafed one is grand) and strong painkillers, i also put olbas oil on a tissue to help keep them clear
3341 2018-03-07 17:14:26 I still swear by it.  I only use coconut oil or olive oil for cooking.
3342 2018-03-07 17:13:58 Look I know the contribution of the industry. I also know of the liabilities that taxpayers will pay for with the Redwater decision. I am sympathetic to folks suffering due to the oil industry slump. But my feeling is that this is going to be a long term slump. Can't be changed.
3343 2018-03-07 17:13:49 One of the main differences from the Petro with the other cryptocurrencies is that the petro is the first cryptocurrency regulated by the state not by the central bank; also it will be backed by mineral resources, such as oil, gold, gas and diamond.
3344 2018-03-07 17:13:49 Roy got an oil change.

3351 2018-03-07 17:12:54 Magnesium oil on your ankles and feet before bed, I also like the supplement, Calm. It’s a powder that’s mixed with water. Also, download the relaxing sounds app and use that to try and drown out some of that extra sound. Hope you got some sleep.

3360 2018-03-07 17:11:26 @Mrs_Northy Crude oil is definitely leading $SPX here. If WTI breaks below $60.50 today this week is going to get VERY ugly for equities. Be ready, 2700 $SPX inbound.
3361 2018-03-07 17:11:24 I would only use CBD oil under the care of a doctor due to the known drug interactions and contraindications, etc. Certain people should NOT use it, and dosing can be tricky.
3362 2018-03-07 17:10:27 2 refineries being repaired. So why the increase with so many across #Canada?

3367 2018-03-07 17:10:22 Of course they are denied by their own government you bloody liar, the government spends all the money importing oil, bauxite and many other things that the country used to produce but thanks to the criminals you defend that no longer is possible

3369 2018-03-07 17:10:17 His crime appears to be that Greenpeace used an old shit boat without a commercial survey, and then he jumped into the water several hundred metres from an oil exploration ship. Note the police didn’t prosecute. Too lame for them to bother. Jail time unlikely.

3375 2018-03-07 17:09:51 Continuing to give your support to a broken system of politics is like driving a car 300,000 miles past its due oil change. Problems with machines dont just fix themselves, parts will break, things will snap and the machine will no longer operate.
3376 2018-03-07 17:09:38 As long as you:
-Lower expectations of what "quality of life" means
-Accept never ending systemic blackouts
-Are okay with the permanent environmental destruction caused by 3rd world extraction of rare Earth minerals
-Admit you still need oil
...

Sure, anything is possible. 
3377 2018-03-07 17:09:30 went last year for 2 weeks. (maybe DM details)  unlike anywhere else I've ever been. as its 1 of t/youngest islands on earth doesn't have coal, oil deposits etc. means Russia/China etc aren't circling 2 monopolise their conventional energy resources. OK history lesson over: )
3378 2018-03-07 17:09:25 16 years ago there was an oil spill accident in the northwest coast of Spain. A politician took the decision to send the damaged ship as far as posible from the coast. The experts said that being close to the coast was better because the oil spill could be contained.

3381 2018-03-07 17:09:02 yeah, I am kicking myself at present but am holding on. Mgmt has done great job in dealing with things so far. Given present levels of industry investment + strong demand growth, the 3 yr horizon for oil is such that prices are likely to be higher than today, perhaps considerably

3383 2018-03-07 17:08:41 @holiviero regarding your tips for surviving without running water, 1) you should provide a link to your source, and 2) why only copy 6 of the 16 tips? Also not sure I would recommend "natural" remedies like Tea Tree Oil when hand sanitizer is the alternative and proven.

3390 2018-03-07 17:08:00 Did you know there are 23 oil & gas production facilities in CA? In 1969 3,360,000 gallons of oil spilled in the ocean. 3 billion gallons!

3391 2018-03-07 17:07:54 They obviously didnt use an oil substitute if fried eggs was meant to be one of the things that made them fat
3392 2018-03-07 17:07:41 Always knew it was a bit of a hype. Guess the bubble has finally burst. But coconut oil is certainly good for dry skin and some people claim it is good for hair too.

3403 2018-03-07 17:06:04 If you can afford a car, yes. So you're partly right about that. But it has also reconfigured cities in ways that make them less hospitable, polluted the earth, and indirectly sparked costly and deadly wars for oil. 1/2
3404 2018-03-07 17:05:42 Why the fuck did I take that oil without eating now I’m feeling like shit
3405 2018-03-07 17:05:38 I am sure folks will need oil for ages. But the fact is that disruption is coming. I mean you can't stop this technological innovation that seems to be speeding up. The billions we're providing to the oil industry from C tax @OilGasCanada needs to be invested in innovation now.
3406 2018-03-07 17:05:30 Wait till we turn off the Oil pipeline.

3413 2018-03-07 17:04:27 So, pull out of the Paris Agreements? Ignore scientific consensus? Pretend that we don't have any moral obligation to anything? Ok, then. 
The age of oil isn't over yet, you can just see the end from here. Be a leader or a follower. Your choice.
3414 2018-03-07 17:04:26 Yes I started the olive oil
3415 2018-03-07 17:04:25 Crude oil is definitely leading $SPX here. If WTI breaks below $60.50 today this week is going to get VERY ugly for equities. Be ready, 2700 $SPX inbound.
3416 2018-03-07 17:04:16 At best she's trying to cure the negative aspects of autism, at worst she's a 'snake oil' seller trying to take advantage of the vulnerable for her own profit. But that is not the same as trying to destroy autism.
3417 2018-03-07 17:04:10 Yeah with oil
3418 2018-03-07 17:03:54 But but report is boolish why oil drop $1 in 20 mins?
3419 2018-03-07 17:03:47 The oil companies made money from the global warming scam, the groups like greenspin used it to bring in funds. Academics of all sorts used it to justify research. Politicians used it as a bandwagon to get votes.

On the other side - the side of the public - a few sceptics
3420 2018-03-07 17:03:34 Truth , also in venezuela  you must refine the crude oil 7 times before it an be used .
3421 2018-03-07 17:03:28 Stone Crop Gel Wash is very gentle, and can be used in the bath as a wash to cleanse. If baby's skin is more on the dry side, or if there’s any irritation Linden Calendula Treatment Cream or Calendula Oil is great to soothe and nourish. We hope this helps :) (2/2)
3422 2018-03-07 17:03:23 Yes and try putting virgin olive oil on her scalp

3424 2018-03-07 17:03:17 Can I cut up flour tortilla, roll the pieces in olive oil and throw em in the oven to make chips? 
3425 2018-03-07 17:02:45 "Important" as in sucking up to Big Oil? We know how everyone else is unimportant to the Cons. Harper already underlined it.
3426 2018-03-07 17:02:44 stocks down, oil down, gold down, crypto down.  i guess putting your money under a mattress is a position.  $SPY $SPX $DJI
3427 2018-03-07 17:02:36 A PAC pools money from its members. That’s it. She has repeatedly explained that she WILL take money Planned Parenthood, Emily’s List,etc but WILL NOT take money from the NRA, Oil companies, etc. If you’re splitting hairs to vilify her, you’re doing your followers an injustice.

3430 2018-03-07 17:02:21 I took three things from it initially...

1. Pizza place cause at least the top part looks like tossing dough.
2. Bike mechanic cause he's repairing a wheel to a bike.
3. Inanimate transformation cause it looks like he's the base to a bike! XD

Motor oil pizzas anyone? :^)

3439 2018-03-07 17:01:41 Keep at it. Due to sulfates our scalps make 100s of times the oil it normally would. Stick w the sulfate free for a couple weeks and your scalp won’t make so much oil & the sulfate free shampoos will work better

3443 2018-03-07 17:01:27 Nice if you can do it without too much leakage and get full-value for the business. ROP is keeping industrial stuff for now (cost basis almost zero, not fully valued since oil crash, doesn’t require capital to keep growing), but someday they might do this too.

3460 2018-03-07 17:00:03 Tellurian chairman Souki: Biggest concern for some oil producers is what to do with the associated gas production. If they can't get the gas out too, the oil won't be produced. #CERAWeek2018
3461 2018-03-07 17:00:00 Hardly. He's not even a democrat. Hasn't started a new social program in his tenure. He's pro oil and gas, pro Ag, anti prisoners rights. Do you people EVER know what you're talking about?

3467 2018-03-07 16:59:02 So I’m sitting here waiting for my oil change to be done and this man probably late 70s knows my dad and mistaked me for my sister because he didn’t believe I was old enough to be in college
3468 2018-03-07 16:58:58 Oil changes, rising gas prices, after about 150k miles something major breaks. I’d rather drive something longer for cheaper that doesn’t put money into the pockets of big oil.
3469 2018-03-07 16:58:57 Someone has to be responsible and watch the cattle and oil wells, so they let the men do the voting.  (The previous statement was sarcasm, carry on)
3470 2018-03-07 16:58:51 I grew up in a house built in 1791. When my mom died, other than electricity, an oil furnace, and basic plumbing, it was darn close to how it looked in 1791. I sold it for 5 times what 9/10 realtors told me it would go for because I knew it was amazing and I was right.

Could the oil rich UK not afford to keep them?
3484 2018-03-07 16:57:36 Tellurian's Charif Souki says the thing that scares US oil producers the most is "what are they going to do with the gas," a reference to the associated gas that is lifted with shale production that has been surging in prolific plays such as the Permian. #CERAWeek18
3485 2018-03-07 16:57:18 It fits their plan of importing third-world military-aged males as breeders thereby creating another underclass of Dem/Liberal voters dependent on the government teat.

3534 2018-03-07 16:52:16 Do you have Tea Tree Oil handy? Treat the wound throughout the day with it, and several days after. It will heal perfectly with zero infection. I'm a landscaper and this is standard at our job sites.
3535 2018-03-07 16:52:00 7 countries in Eastern Africa are experiencing draught caused by climate change. People are dying. But the human population continues to extract oil and make the situation worse while 300 people, 9 corporations and a handful or leaders continue to accumulate wealth
3536 2018-03-07 16:51:58 So you totally ignored my last tweet then Allan,,have you no comment on that?,,do you not think its rich that oil rich scots need bailed out by those who take that 92%
3537 2018-03-07 16:51:54 @LeBatardShow best way to have spicy popcorn is not hot sauce, but you put crushed red pepper in the hot oil before you put the corn in.   Try it!
3538 2018-03-07 16:51:51 @CBCMaritimeNoon  Not a fan listening to the pro oil and gas destruction show going on today. Suggesting cleaning up sites like sydney tarponds as job creation is insane. So we destroy things to clean it up in the name of jobs?
3539 2018-03-07 16:51:48 I knew there was a player out there with enough oil to allow her tight mouth to swing free. She will speak and we will listen like we did with Clinton. Unlike Clinton this is a civil court, the shoe is on the other foot now #45.

3542 2018-03-07 16:51:44 Kenney rattles his saber insulting BC'ians by claiming Russians are responsible for opposition 2 the pipeline. It plays up 2 his base of conspiracy theorists & Rebel followers & gets him lots of free press. 
But it's only us who live here&who'd be affected bigtime by oil spills.

3549 2018-03-07 16:51:18 Morning, sir. I can't say the solo peppermint or the supercharged combo of peppermint/clove/wintergreen essential oil diluted in rubbing alcohol PLUS wintergreen alcohol wasn't helpful. I didn't see it/them, just heard inside broiler oven.

3551 2018-03-07 16:50:57 Why are men like this... Dad picked up my Bio oil and asked if he could use it on his hair  oh and yesterday he needed a lip balm and he checked all off them to make sure none is tinted because he doesn't trust me with this 
3552 2018-03-07 16:50:45 @Trader_Bran Oil behaving very well technically - I took the short from the highs - with size back to 50%, then took half off .... remainder off at weekly pivot and nr close of gap. Made sense given balanced nature context this week and data.
3553 2018-03-07 16:50:43 Commodities and tokens both have a duel function. Investors can wager on the price of a barrel of oil and oil can also can be refined into utility products like gas. Many tokens share a similar duel function: speculation and utility in a tokenized network. #cftc vs #sec

3558 2018-03-07 16:50:19 How bout this... the oil sands is for the most part, oil that can be obtained using a shovel.... by processing this sand and taking out the oil, an oil ‘spill’ is being cleaned up.... oil ‘flows’ in the lakes and water south of McMurry naturally... just saying...
3559 2018-03-07 16:50:18 So this is the same pricing when a drum of oil was through the roof. What's the excuse now?

3564 2018-03-07 16:50:06 The LNA's mobilization towards #Sebha will delay a potential military operation in #Derna. Expanding the LNA's influence and control over territory and key oil/gas and water infrastructure is a key part of the LNA's expansionist strategy into the South/West of #Libya.
3565 2018-03-07 16:49:57 If I got a dollar for every time a pipeliner/oil trash/welder only tipped me a $1, when their wallet literally looks like a brick, I would make more than I do in tips.

3611 2018-03-07 16:45:19 I can't remember the source. I think it was Jimmy Dore, but regardless. This was all planned from the 1950's with the setup to change to the petro-dollar. We were to invade these countries in order, with jordan and iran last on the list to consolidate power/oil.
3612 2018-03-07 16:45:17 You are delusional. Calgary offices is still one third empty, unemployment is still sky high, and oil & gas investment is down 62% since 2014. Albertans don't want to support the fat cat public sector after this gong show.

3635 2018-03-07 16:42:45 Maybe the explanation is as simple as this: in 2016, when @JasonVillalba called Donald Trump "a buffoonish, clownish, orange, carnival barking snake oil salesman" his fate in any GOP primary in Texas was sealed. Talking truth to power is always risky.

3670 2018-03-07 16:39:45 Other current favorite: red pepper flakes, olive oil, fresh-grated parmesan or romano.

3672 2018-03-07 16:39:24 interesting take on coffee, keepin the world "jacked" as the 2nd most traded commodity, while the primary commodity (oil) poisons the earth......a double whammy, each accelerating the other....symbiots that r also an overall parasite.

"temple"? isnt it tho.... = )
AH-MAY-ZING!
3673 2018-03-07 16:39:22 Wrong Wrong Wrong.
Food, Medicines, Basic Staples and shortage started even back in 2008 when oil Barrel hit record high over $140!
Massive nationalizations, destruction of the private sector and corrupt officials who stole $ 400 billion in 15 years are the Cause!
3674 2018-03-07 16:39:18 Getting my oil changed.  Will they suggest I need a new
3675 2018-03-07 16:39:15 I use coconut oil for everything
3676 2018-03-07 16:39:13 Kau kena cari cleansing oil yang no mineral oil. Sebab kita pakai sunscreen dan geng2nya. Dan scrub pon okay gak. Goodluck nonad. Marolah kota mencapai  flawless bersama sama. Ayuh!
3677 2018-03-07 16:38:55 I think it has something to do with all the money and oil they have. Those things seem to have quite a lot of influence these days.

3679 2018-03-07 16:38:35 What’s sad is that there are a lot of uneducated uninformed people who buy your snake oil.
3680 2018-03-07 16:38:33 Same thing I was thinking! Oil BOOMS in the water? 
3681 2018-03-07 16:38:33 Wrong Wrong Wrong.

3682 2018-03-07 16:38:21 Think about that.

According to the GOP, "the U.S. TAXPAYERS are 'allegedly on the hook' for PAYING for Kurdish ARMS, VEHICLES, TRAINING" despite the FACT the Kurds are sitting on TRILLIONS of OIL."

And then we "have to pay for the same COSTS for every other rebel faction?"
3683 2018-03-07 16:38:18 Club is in a great position on and off the field considering no oil money propping is up
3684 2018-03-07 16:38:16 Texas values? You mean counting oil wells or cows. You care about nothing else.

3686 2018-03-07 16:38:11 Oh yes. It had to do with Germany’s vast oil fields, and absolutely nothing to do with public disarmament and.....you know.....Nazis. Totally about the oil.
3687 2018-03-07 16:38:08 Ohhhh I have peppermint & oregano oil with me that I put in MCT oil as a shot.  I’ll get on that.  It’s been a week or so since I did it last.
3688 2018-03-07 16:38:07 Alberta will have to do other stuff than just oil and gas. @OilGasCanada I mean kids won't do this route if there is going to be increased automation and AI involved. Jobs uncertain in the industry. Best to do something else in my opinion. World has changed. AB has stayed same.
3689 2018-03-07 16:37:58 Actually that is incorrect.  The US sells about 20% of BC's oil needs and it is at a premium price.  AB supplies 70% as well as most of the jet fuel.

3692 2018-03-07 16:37:42 Other countries must have threatened to cut off oil, coal, and gas Imports.....
3693 2018-03-07 16:37:41 Allan do you think scots would be better off with 100% of our oil revenues
or the 8% we get at present?
Do you not think it odd that oil rich scots need bailed out by 13.3BN by the no oil rUK,who take that 92%
Can you not see the utter disgrace of that?
3694 2018-03-07 16:37:40 Been there once an nothing on that menu be makin any damn sense... Honey roasted turkey with Himalayan tomatoes, roasted au gratin cranberry sauce, Nordic lettuce an a zesty avocado oil spread...

3697 2018-03-07 16:37:29 Love a bit LPG we do loads of it and it’s cleaner than oil to work with  and the boilers are lighter to move!
3698 2018-03-07 16:37:26 Well, take Turkish oil wrestling but take the clothes off... It's still going to be super gay but with wieners out 
3699 2018-03-07 16:37:23 That’s fine by me if they pull forces out of dier ez zour-not Kurdish land anyway- it holds quite a bit oil reserves which’s why theused them as cannon fodder to stop the SAA from crossing the Euphrates to secure it- but if Isis counters in dier- will cross the river
3700 2018-03-07 16:37:02 What price #sneachta ?
Heating oil price for 1,000 litres
25th Feb  €647
28th Feb  €666
1st March €671
4% increase in 4 days
3701 2018-03-07 16:37:00 The oil because I like the product going straight into my system without hurting my lungs (or feeling like I am) haha and it’s easiest for me! @meghanoelll :)
3702 2018-03-07 16:36:57 Govt of UK MADE the Saudis what they are: took a nondescript desert tribe & elevated them to 'royal' status as a reward for help in securing Mide-East Oil reserves.
3703 2018-03-07 16:36:56 So no matter what the demand is in the world, if folks don't want to buy our oil there isn't much we can do about it. The coal fired power plants that are being phased out might mean higher electricity costs in the future. But again, I don't know. In any case the future is sad.
3704 2018-03-07 16:36:47 It’s upsetting when you think about just how prosperous Iraq could be - it has so much oil - it has the potential to be like the other gulf countries(if not better). 

Corruption, Saddam, global intervention ruined it all.

3708 2018-03-07 16:36:25 But that was down to other factors (oil price shock-creating inflastion-unions chasing higher increases as a result...etc etc?)
Recovery def helped by Nth Sea oil but also (say) Thatcher govt's union reforms,& *Big Bang* (and indeed (not too)high inflation that ate mortage debt)?
3709 2018-03-07 16:36:14 อากาศร้อนแบบนึกกว่ากลางวันอะ ถ้าไม่มีแอร์นี่ตายแน่ ทุกวันนี้คือยอมจ่ายค่าไฟแพงเพื่อแลกกับการไม่ร้อนตาย !!
3710 2018-03-07 16:36:05 Hard swipes left.
3711 2018-03-07 16:35:54 As for the oil production sure, it's booming in USA. I guess folks will frack and produce product to keep up their profits. But the future for resources is less pretty. Technological innovations will dec resource use and I'm guessing that Alberta's oil is not the first choice.
3712 2018-03-07 16:35:53 The media uses jargon to bully conservatives.
3713 2018-03-07 16:35:51 NASA needs to discover "oil" in Mars to get some serious money

3716 2018-03-07 16:35:35 Haircut done, oil change now, then knock out this 5 hour shift then niggas is Miami bound
3717 2018-03-07 16:35:26 We cannot subsidize any industry unfairly & oil/coal have real estate incentives that need to extended to all sectors-micro grid technology will make America safer from EMP attacks-a trend that will continue even w/subsidies-I’m not opposed to HE coal at all-level play 4 all!

3720 2018-03-07 16:34:57 I love how I brought my car in for an oil change yesterday and today it's still up on a lift getting a new bearing and hub. $535 oil change. Awesome.
3721 2018-03-07 16:34:55 How do we overcome fluctuations in oil price with a bigger % of economy directly tied to it? If we apply to EU as a new member will we have to take the euro? What share of UK debt will we take on? For starters.
3722 2018-03-07 16:34:55 I almost dropped Alex’s keys down the oil drain at work.....

3725 2018-03-07 16:34:49 Unlike with plastic their isn't really to many alternate non-gas guzzling options when it comes to vehicles.  Maybe if we didn't continue supporting an outdated industry like oil/coal that would change, but making sure the rich stay rich & the poor stay poor is more important.

3736 2018-03-07 16:33:56 Both are based and work in the west of Canada. Why should they jump in this local debate? Sewage water overflow is a regrettable problem that affects many municipalities along the Great Lakes and the St-Lawrence. It's still easier to fix than oil spills and wrecked climate.

3746 2018-03-07 16:33:21 That oil is already refined and it doesn't sink like Dilbit. 

Albertan oil sinks and is impossible to clean up, hence the opposition to Albertan dilbit and lack of opposition to the oil shipped in from washington state.
3747 2018-03-07 16:33:20 I treat my skin soooo good, facemask, poor minimizing face wash, black head strip thingys moisturizer, tee tree oil and it STILL has the AUDACITY to breakout. This is UNACCEPTABLE

3753 2018-03-07 16:32:37 @SecretaryZinke The only thing "un-American," Secretary Zinke, is the control the oil and gas lobbies have over you. Have you no integrity, no backbone, no shame?

3762 2018-03-07 16:31:46 How is suggesting Alberta oil is far more “ethical” than oil from the Middle East or Venezuela a lie?
3763 2018-03-07 16:31:44 Funny because most of the oil we use in Vancouver comes from California and washington state refineries. Little to none of the oil from Alberta is used here, it's all shipped overseas.

On electric cars - the change will not be as fast as predicted -the lack of  exploration on new oil fields  is going create a shortfall before electric reduces consumption sufficiently

3779 2018-03-07 16:30:01 Compra castor oil, también ayuda
3780 2018-03-07 16:29:40 My last reply Daniel. The 3.5 BOPD is the "held by production figure" which is a positive so the license doesn't expire. The price paid for the license is also irrelevant as oil assets can be cheap as who will fund the $3-500k drill costs? Hence credit facility which is a rarity

3816 2018-03-07 16:25:42 Let's dial this back for a moment. How was socialism not to blame for Venezuela pissing away a huge reserve of oil? The natural resources were there.
3817 2018-03-07 16:25:36 man… there’s a really good joke here about ur face. But I’m going to pass on it because im supposed to be nice to my elders
3818 2018-03-07 16:25:29 OH!!! I will have to try that!!! I want to try avocado oil too. Not so much for the buttery part but because it sounds good!!

3825 2018-03-07 16:24:29 Hey, when the oil industry and the NRA write the "you really work for me" checks do they write them to Ted or Rafael Cruz?
3826 2018-03-07 16:24:25 @seanspicer ??? Is he still around? BTW, I thought Trump was the "snake oil salesman."  And Sarah Huckleberry Sanders' issue with you is that she's illogically attracted to you and has to resist the feeling. You're the high school guy who made her blush when you said "hi" to her.
3827 2018-03-07 16:24:17 What about ur(BJD) goons vandalising during strike in odisha oil price hike....will u condemn for that...no u can't ,
3828 2018-03-07 16:24:13 It’s forgotten by those harping back to the 70s that the pound was in free fall after the collapse of fixed exchange rates in 1971. I went to a lot: 10CHF to £ in 1971, 8 in 1972, 6 in 1974, 4 in 1977, 2.5 in 1980. Then recovered as North Sea oil production took off.
3829 2018-03-07 16:24:06 I just wanna know what's the coconut oil for
3830 2018-03-07 16:24:05 Programs typically develop greater momentum & impact than their projects. But they dont respond well to direction changes. A little like steering an oil tanker! #PMOT #Leadership
3831 2018-03-07 16:23:56 He doesn't care - only cares about the oil.
3832 2018-03-07 16:23:30 Q said "did you catch the first boom -"  I think that is referring to the POTUS retweet re: oil production in US.

Stormy is going to backfire once the discovery phase is reached...

NK is huge - I think we are looking for public acknowledgement of the word BOOM
3833 2018-03-07 16:23:24 crude adj -.57mbd.  so either crude exp and ref inp were estimated too high or prod and imp were estimated too low.  I'm betting on imp estimate being way too low.  There were tankers everywhere last week. #OOTT #EIAreport #WTI #oil
3834 2018-03-07 16:23:22 Pakistan has nukes, Turkey has longevity (relative to other 'Muslim powers'), Saudi has oil.

3839 2018-03-07 16:23:10 What size is this, oil on canvas?
3840 2018-03-07 16:23:05 You mostly cut taxes for the rich and corporations. You have helped oil and coal companies. You have done NOTHING for the average American.
3841 2018-03-07 16:22:57 ... there was a very faint ‘rain Boeing’ around the sun like you get with oil on water (what that called?) Im convinces that’s Geo engineering maybe to slow global warming.

How can our leaders easily short change our future, at every opportunity they have. 

It would have been ranked up with the crude oil.

And to think the folk there where laughing. sober reflection
3844 2018-03-07 16:22:41 @SaraBareilles use Tea tree oil on it.
3845 2018-03-07 16:22:37 Let’s get this right - $12 trillion in trade loss+ $6.5 trillion Iraq war + $5 trillion direct gasoline tax on American as a result of Iraq war and oil price increase = > national debt of $21 trillion.  What a performance!
3846 2018-03-07 16:22:24 Morata falls too easily, and he is petulant, the oil in his hair might be affecting his decisions, he comes in late and gets booked for complaining, funkeee is this brother okay?

3850 2018-03-07 16:22:01 we've oil yet we  bought fuel for #300 per liter, stealing has become part of govt. Our PMB want to help ghana fight corruption
3851 2018-03-07 16:22:00 Increasing the capacity of the KM line will have no impact on our gas prices here in BC whatsoever, this extra oil is to go into an oil tanker and sail through our waters to Asia. This is Alberta selling oil at bargain prices to the US and then us buying it back as gas at premium
3852 2018-03-07 16:21:58 You clearly don't care about enriching oil tycoons #selfish
3853 2018-03-07 16:21:55 Texas has benefited by Trumps slashing regulations as they relate to the Oil and Gas Industry.  Permian basin is becoming one of the most prolific plays in the World bringing billions to the state.  WHAT MORE DOES TEXAS WANT???

3860 2018-03-07 16:21:12 #OOTT | Overall, oil supplies are ample despite efforts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia to withhold output in order to prop up prices. cc. @CNBC #WTI #Brent #Oil
3861 2018-03-07 16:20:58 Have to go to Halfords. I pride myself on being able to look as confused as possible in that shop. Last time the kind man put the oil in the car for me. #IndependentWoman
3862 2018-03-07 16:20:57 But probably more so the *shape* of the material. Using felt would solve marks but creating worse sound. Using same material but with bigger area (than a thin ring) against the surface would spread the vibration pressure making it harder to push out the oil.

3867 2018-03-07 16:19:52 Imagine if we weren't dependent on oil from the Middle East. Would we have been so concerned with going to war there? There would still be Israel but the world doesn't typically concern itself with backwater countries where there are little financial interest involved.
3868 2018-03-07 16:19:44 In the statute under which 44 expanded national monuments, I understand there is no provision for undoing those expansions. The Zinke/Hatch oil scam needs to be stopped by the courts now.
3869 2018-03-07 16:19:44 You can' slam' all you like, but the Tory Party you voted for won't be able to protect Scotland's fishing rights - and indeed has said it won't - while it remains a London preserve, and there's oil wells all over it. Get a grip!

3872 2018-03-07 16:19:36 Thank you. I found that peppermint oil kind of helps deter them away. So, I used like 3 bottles outside and inside. Lol

3883 2018-03-07 16:18:00 But sure, y'all go blame the other captive parties-the NDP and the Liberals. It's funny. All the political parties are sucking up to the oil industry. We're being used to subsidize profits of the oil companies. @OilGasCanada Why are the companies here in AB if they can't make it?
3884 2018-03-07 16:17:58 i get raw coconut oil so it's the stuff that comes in solid form and i just put a spoonful of it in the coffee and waited for it to melt and omg it's so good
3885 2018-03-07 16:17:53 I went to get my car's oil changed after work. Over two hours and a hundred dollars in repairs later I still need to go in for about $300 of maintenance before the fall.

3894 2018-03-07 16:16:33 Vitamin E oil. It help get rid of the scar and can help when you start getting a blemish
3895 2018-03-07 16:15:50 The silly wine embargo in response to Kenney's posturing. The phase out of coal fired power plants to keep up the greenwashing show. It's clear to me that the NDP are even more in the thrall of the oil industry. @OilGasCanada is happy and still asks for more. NDP worse than PCs.
3896 2018-03-07 16:15:44 My sarva roga nivarini is coconut oil. For feet, before bath, and before bed. (Clean feet first). Wear socks to avoid spoiling the sheets.

3900 2018-03-07 16:15:05 @BillNye can I ask why trans mountain is important but the oil production in California isn’t? Or why you fly to places knowing it took fossil fuels to do that? Why are you singling our one place and not others seems hypocritical don’t you say?
3901 2018-03-07 16:15:05 There's certainly enough oil on the fucker.
3902 2018-03-07 16:14:51 This employee is so rude at Valvoline. Short, ugly, buck toothed lil mfka. Acts like I'm annoying him and I haven't even said anything beyond "i need an oil change" I'll roast tf out of him don't he know?
3903 2018-03-07 16:14:49 I’m sayin! I just found out they have a 80oz version of the Argan oil one & the olive oil one. But the castor oil one is bomb for wash n gos & ive used my 32oz jar 4 times & it’s almost empty 
3904 2018-03-07 16:14:47 The NDP have done  a ton of stuff. Carbon tax that takes  cash out of pockets of every citizen. Billions go to the oil industry for innovations they're too cheap and lazy to do themselves. @OilGasCanada Then the orphan well loan of $235 million plus the $30 million for int charge

3949 2018-03-07 16:09:22 Do you understand the importance of the U.S. being the largest oil producer in the world? i.e. the petro dollar. THIS is huge and much larger than any sort of direct semantics you through at it. Maybe you should understand why were WEREN't the largest producer for so long.

3960 2018-03-07 16:08:32 We should focus on becoming energy independent. The EU relies on Russia for perhaps 30% of its gas - and in turn we rely on that. We rely on Norway etc oil ?90% imported by 2020. If there were several tidal lagoons around Wales they'd be an energy exporter.
3961 2018-03-07 16:08:32 Oil leaks are the trend today it seems - Haas has also suffered one, keeping Grosjean in the garage after 64 laps #F1 #F1Testing
3962 2018-03-07 16:08:28 No progress. sure.. if we’d have followed testa.. we would have free cheep energy, have no more wars over oil and put all you oil tycoons out of business with destroying out environment/ oceans and eating all of our money.. putting your bet on oil is like nursing on a dead horse.

So now I’m pulling out & just dropped 150.

3998 2018-03-07 16:05:08 So plot twist, my car was so low on oil it didn’t even show up on the stick. Dad told me i was on my own and I’m old enough to do it myself. Little does he know, i called Will and he told me how to do it.
3999 2018-03-07 16:05:04 No bounces off of it. Oil doesn’t bounce off Teflon so who knows what i’m thinking!

4002 2018-03-07 16:04:45 Did you dilute the oil? It had an adverse effect on me, my eyebrows shed like crazy after and the hair didn’t come in thicker

4009 2018-03-07 16:03:50 Well, John. Welcome to the politically motivated garroting of an export industry crucial to BC's economy. Looks a lot like the kick in the teeth you gave Alberta oil. How's it feel to be on the business end? @jkenney must be laughing at your predicament.
4010 2018-03-07 16:03:43 You think Hillary would’ve been different? Sure she would’ve gotten rid of coal because the oil and gas companies were paying her to push fracking, so once again, we’re fucked either way.

4020 2018-03-07 16:02:18 The reason the world doesn’t say anything it’s because of oil. Iran’s natural resources is sold to world market very cheap. Videos and info about it is all over internet. They’ll be in power until Iran’s natural resources is dried out.

4022 2018-03-07 16:02:08 Yes, I noticed that. These days though, they seem to hate something/one new every week, all the while, pushing their snake oil supplements on people. They're ridiculous!
4023 2018-03-07 16:02:05 Yes! Just exfoliate the area twice a week, and apply straight raw Vit E oil to the scars and then moisturize morning and night! They will fade and you’ll see a huge difference in two weeks! Also stay out of the sun, the sun will only cause them to become darker.

4036 2018-03-07 16:01:00 I think targeting the oil industry with burdensome taxes and regulations will be far more harmful than most people realize. The economy is tanking and we need to prop our greatest economical asset.

4046 2018-03-07 16:00:18 this is my fav tofu marinade. 
1 – 14 oz. package extra firm tofu
2 Tablespoons tamari or soy sauce
1 Tablespoon sesame oil or olive oil
1 Tablespoon sriracha
1/2 Tablespoon maple syrup or honey

let sit at least 30 minutes
fry in some oil until both sides crispy
4047 2018-03-07 16:00:14 Why are you interested in foreigners being in our Agriculture business/industry. What is it they will do that we can't do locally. Foreigners have been in our oil industry for years but a local(Dangote) is building the largest refinery in the world for us.
4048 2018-03-07 16:00:13 Child please!! Everyone knows Hurricanes are only created using the CIA's secret weather machine and only at the request of the U.N. to keep oil prices high.  Now pardon me while i adjust my tinfoil hat and take a nap in my hyperbaric chamber.

4055 2018-03-07 15:59:29 Lotus land should just buy Tesla cars or move into the interior of BC where price of gas in WL only 1.159.  We need more refineries in BC/Canada or this problem will continue.  Oil companies and government like the mafia when it comes to gasoline.

4084 2018-03-07 15:56:13 U must be joking. You are allowing your state to become an illegal and garbage dump site and you are worried about the optics and monies that oil rigs give. Check your donor list Sen and then comment on saving the ocean over Americans.

4086 2018-03-07 15:55:52 My kpop faves are so pretty in makeup! I mean, they don't need to go all out but a bit of basic skincare and some light oil control foundation would help so many of them.
4087 2018-03-07 15:55:42 I've made it a few times now. It works well, smells like whatever essential oil you pick and keeps for an eternity, as long as you keep it cool enough so it doesn't melt again. So, bigger batches shouldn't be a problem.

And I like your kind of currency ^.^
4088 2018-03-07 15:55:30 Amazing only a few years ago we were wondering if we could drive our autos on chicken droppings. Now we are energy independent  need not send our dollars to dictators for oil.Its the main indirect funding source for terror @seanhannity Obama wanted $10 per gal oil

4094 2018-03-07 15:55:09 So the reason for the sudden increase in CO2 is a sudden massive increase in termite populations globally that just so happens to coincide perfectly with the industrial revolution and the massive burning of coal and oil. 

...Sounds plausible 

...or pathetic and desperate
4095 2018-03-07 15:55:05 อร๊ายยย ขอไปเกาก่อนนะออเจ้า ไปมีตผัวก่อน
4096 2018-03-07 15:55:04 We have crude oil but we can't even get fuel to buy and when we eventually do the meter won't be accurate,  let's not even talk about the price.  
We have oil but no functioning refinerywe now export the oil and import finished product.  
4097 2018-03-07 15:55:03 I think it's a terrible idea to target the oil industry so feverishly considering the harmful impact it will have on the economy. There has to be balance here, do you not agree?

4100 2018-03-07 15:54:55 I'm determined to take down big business monopolies, you can learn more information in my book "The History of the Standard Oil Company".
4101 2018-03-07 15:54:38 Our outflow of dollars for gold and el chronic foods is higher than oil outflow we can create gold and oil but we can definitely force mnc to make in India thing we should learn from china twist the arm till they don’t open factories here when @sureshpprabhu will understand this
4102 2018-03-07 15:54:31 Unlike my opponent, I will protect our young entrepreneurs, our brave firefighters and our precious oil supply. In fact, I support the union of these things!
4103 2018-03-07 15:54:30 BUT, if there was provable corruption in that “let them go” policy there may be a chance.

Personally, I only use butter in my scrambled eggs  Just olive oil and coconut oil for everything else. I prefer olive oil.

4111 2018-03-07 15:53:43 .@Shell CEO: If we as an industry ignore the possibility that #oil demand could peak rapidly because the world has never mobilized policy-wise to facilitate a change like that before, we do so at our peril.

4116 2018-03-07 15:53:07 The guys at @jiffylube just said I probably DIDN’T need to change my oil yet?!? Thanks for saving me some money!
4117 2018-03-07 15:53:04 Andrew this doesn't seem right. The whole thing seems like the equivalent to a oil company sponsored climate change study.

4122 2018-03-07 15:52:26 Great for those with sleep, anxiety or pain issues. My fave @YouPlusCBD Oil is the gold formula. In drop form it's easily absorbed by the body.

4124 2018-03-07 15:52:22 I thought it was oil and girls with cat ears?
4125 2018-03-07 15:52:20 Correct the market is worth £20bn which is nothing to do with the value of their company. If you set up an oil company that wouldn't mean your company was worth the market value.
4126 2018-03-07 15:52:13 I have no idea tbh.but every morning I mix almond milk , quest protein powder, turmeric , black pepper , mct oil and coffee and drink that for breakfast..I just trust that it’s doing something good..my mouth turns orange & I poop 30 times at work.
4127 2018-03-07 15:52:07 CBD Oil helps support & nourish the nervous system overall. Gives a sense of wellbeing while maintaining clarity & focus.

4134 2018-03-07 15:51:47 It is probably the only example of that, and because of the large reliance on North Sea oil to sustain the model, it is at odds with the environmental movement. And it also has a free market.
4135 2018-03-07 15:51:36 So far today I’ve gotten my keys copied, my oil changed, and scheduled a 530 dollar appointment next week to get my tires changed
4136 2018-03-07 15:51:36 Well Butts was the President of the WWF Canada at the time.  This is not a surprise.  This is around the time when he said in a speech that we needed to keep all the oil in the ground.  Now he advises the PM - scary.
4137 2018-03-07 15:51:28 While Maduro has not been great,the people of the country elected him in fairer elections that in the USA.The oil price has dropped & the meddling by America instituting economic warfare has made the problems worse.All is not as straight forward as meets the eye

4155 2018-03-07 15:49:58 I lived in Alberta at the time of the NEP While there was pushback from US oil interests most of it for show what really happened was the normal boom and bust cycle The rest is just political theatre

4161 2018-03-07 15:49:19 I was being a bit flippant. But North Slope oil only got going in early 70's (mid-60's leases) so processed foods likely rare on the Chukchi in those days.  Likely different today.
4162 2018-03-07 15:48:51 Dirt-Eeze will get rid oil paint, oil, silicone etc. They have a rough side and a smooth side. Wouldn’t recommend them for a Baby’s arse.

4365 2018-03-07 15:31:01 Nobody got "scammed" & nothing was "given away to the oil barons" despite your ignorant rhetoric. People like you are exactly what is wrong with this country. You blindly support "renewable energy" while completely lacking any skills necessary to critically evaluate the issue.

1. #Let'sPretendThatHashtagsAreMoreEffectiveThanActualThoughtBecauseWeAllKnowThatYou'lleepDrivingEscalades
2. Renewables are a better investment because this creates jobs that don't exist. That's deep  How many jobs lost (but not counted) in oil patch?

4376 2018-03-07 15:30:09 No tariff for Japan. Instead fix trade imbalance with our oil deals. Ask big traders to import more from USA to offset imbalance. Or else! Then a tariff. Make them fix it.
4377 2018-03-07 15:29:58 Equal opportunity vs equal outcome. Sure go work the oil rigs. Go work outside in -30 for the big $$$. That's what the feminists want you to do. Don't choose nurse. Or school teacher. Feminists don't want that. You got to be miserable like them.

4381 2018-03-07 15:29:43 Or you could say that what happened years ago in a different part of the USA or world when oil was 30-50% less has little relevance to what will happen now. A bit like your comment on flow rates drilling into an already producing field, comparing this to #UKOG exploratory drill
4382 2018-03-07 15:29:27 very weak oil for now

4390 2018-03-07 15:28:56 ... our planet further. As if the plastic hasn’t already harmed it by the extractive process of crude oil mining that is needed to produce plastics and that has regular disasters in the environment
4391 2018-03-07 15:28:55 Fundamentals do support a bearish stance but oil price doesn’t always follow fundamentals. That is why you need to bend like a reed in the river & go where the current takes you.
4392 2018-03-07 15:28:54 Poor little baby@ I just want to put my arms around the sweet thing. Can’t do that but I can avoid palm oil...so I will.
4393 2018-03-07 15:28:53 The plan to devaluate the dollar is starting to work. Creating new taxes,decimating the oil and gas sector,out of control spending, debt through the roof. As Canada shuts the door on investment capital and our GDP sinks now tariffs don't matter with a dollar that matches tariffs.
4394 2018-03-07 15:28:50 “Ethical”?? Self-serving hogwash. Not sure where the ethics of letting Albertans suffer the health costs of failing to clean up toxic tailings ponds is ethical. Or forcing more dirty oil emissions into the air and spills on the land and water.
4395 2018-03-07 15:28:34 #oil in 2
4396 2018-03-07 15:28:34 So basically the "new" #NorthKoreanSanctions were actually just a REITERATION of existing sanctions.

4433 2018-03-07 15:24:15 Yes... but I think we can agree that engine cant run until they fix the oil leak. Whatever the issue  lets not tweet sponsor links until at least the car is on the track and moving.
4434 2018-03-07 15:24:03 As the oil is running out and the Saudi economy is dwindling the new prince makes a meagre gesture of allowing women to drive to show he is modern man! Women still cant travel/own property/sign documents/have bank accounts so where is the progress?
4435 2018-03-07 15:23:52 Can we talk about #SelfCare for a minute?

Was up too late last night- so I woke up a lil early, took a bath, and had  for breakfast.

In the bath I used conditioner on my beard. When I got out, used a lil coconut oil in it. Beard’s never felt this hydrated. I feel refreshed.

4438 2018-03-07 15:23:25 I been laying in bed naked covered in coconut oil for like 20 minutes. These are things money can’t buy

Try the LOC method to moisturise your hair. 
Liquid : spritz your hair with water until its damp not wet.
Oil : moiturise with an oil (I use castor and coconut)
Cream : apply a hair butter or cream
4440 2018-03-07 15:23:17 @SecretaryZinke Regulations on Oil & gas drilling on public lands are "un-American"?  Really?? Do you know the definition of "public lands"?  I believe it's a sin to hand over the public's land to private enterprise.  Have you visited a superfund site lately?

4456 2018-03-07 15:22:11 It may be slow for some businesses bcoz after oil price slum economies are not doing that great but last year Bangladesh has sent highest number of people in the history to work abroad. Trend continues.

4492 2018-03-07 15:18:57 Nah. Yanks are wrong. It's aluminium. And it's centri-fugal, not centrifiggle. It's ore-gano, not oreggano. Maths is the shortened version of mathematics.

Don't butcher the English language the way your country keeps butchering nations around the world for oil.
4493 2018-03-07 15:18:57 i forgot that the key to keeping my hair from being dry is to put in conditioner and then oil after i shower and /not/ towel dry it so much like it still needs to be pretty wet

4495 2018-03-07 15:18:47 He’s never intended to be a True Secretary of State either. He has a personal interest in Big Oil & that’s what he’s loyal too. This Boy Scout claim must be bec they wouldn’t sell out their Country.

4504 2018-03-07 15:18:16 James Martin is a great advertisement for butter and olive oil. I've learned that "just a touch" of oil means about a third of the bottle.

4509 2018-03-07 15:17:14 No time like the present to switch on to electric & get off the oil. BTW. ...Europe's fuel prices are around 1.50 euros per litre. By comparison, our oil is still cheap.
4510 2018-03-07 15:17:13 This is where I go for tires thanks to a reco from @vi_jedi. I’m just here for an oil change
4511 2018-03-07 15:17:12 Utah politicians are screwed up. They also just disclosed that shrinking Bears Ears was all about oil exploitation. And yes, I used that word on purpose.

4514 2018-03-07 15:16:49 Thanks for this, we would ask you to clean any burnt bits off the base and then try making soup again but this time oil the base before adding the ingredients and this will prevent the ingredients from burning. Jordan,

4518 2018-03-07 15:16:19 That describes my life. Social anxiety and no decent extended family make it worse. No taking the cbl oil from the health food shop to try and alleviate anxiety. Depression makes things worse. Vicious circle. I empathise with people who end up trying to medicate themselves

4527 2018-03-07 15:15:38 He’s a criminal and should have gone to prison - end of. If he did credit card fraud, then cannabis oil, do you really think his next “job” will be in an office or McD’s? It’s this sympathetic, socialist, PC bs that’s got UK in the hole it’s in.

4529 2018-03-07 15:15:23 I think, they are correct to do something about it.. US has long been critizised about it.. before explanation was import of oil, but that is gone too.. so yes, they need to improve their products, but need fair trade as well..

4541 2018-03-07 15:14:17 Condi doesn’t have an Exxon oil tanker named after her for no reason. She’s long been a shill for big oil.
4542 2018-03-07 15:14:16 #BP: in the long term natural #gas will become the second most consumed energy source in the world after #oil and before #coal, which is presently number 2

4546 2018-03-07 15:13:57 There are other countries with a lot of oil that haven't managed it like Norway.  That's the point.  And America, for instance, has much more natural resources.  Yet.....

4554 2018-03-07 15:13:21 Rick Perry seems to have forgotten the massive oil and gas boom that occurred during the last administration in a stunning speech at #ceraweek18.

4558 2018-03-07 15:12:36 Isn’t that like saying butter comes from cows’ teats? Tar is a product that’s made from processing oil, not the other way around. Bill Nye actually gets paid for saying this stuff.
4559 2018-03-07 15:12:34 Seriously how long does it take to do an oil change 
4560 2018-03-07 15:12:11 Spoiler alert: it was oil

4571 2018-03-07 15:11:23 And that's because the technology to support societies with alternate energy sources does not exist, yet.
Until it does...
Check out the dollars spent by big oil, on researching alternative energy sources. They aren't ignoring them.

4576 2018-03-07 15:11:01 Did someone hijack your account?
Suzuki, like other environmentalists is suggesting Canada leave oil in the ground while a few dozen miles south they frack and pump freely. That makes no sense and will do nothing to help the environment; only helps US economy.

4591 2018-03-07 15:09:21 Gas is $1.03 in Calgary & $1.48 in Vancouver. I hope that Oil companies are not colluding to force British Columbians to pay more in order to push through the Kinder Morgan pipeline.

Maybe oil/gas/coal/nuclear/NRA & hunting groups/mining/real estate development/lumber? Conflict of interest any1?

Brent spot price has made no sustained gain for 2.5 months since late Dec
Brent six-month calendar spread has made no sustained gain for almost 3 months since early Dec
Pause before resumed upward move?
Or sign that price has peaked for now?
4596 2018-03-07 15:08:24 Govt is supposed to be of the people for the people by the people. Only Russian meddling means it wasn't by the people, Trump and his policies lies and scandals prove nothing he does is for the people. It's 2018 the earth isn't getting any bigger and oil doesn't grow on trees.
4597 2018-03-07 15:08:16 Yes we are. Lol. I see it too. It’s a oil diffuser I got from target. Helps me sleep and relax me when I do my yoga and meditation it changes color. Bout $50

4617 2018-03-07 15:05:44 Hmmm. People talk about hair being in transition and the scalp goes into overdrive producing too much oil. Could it be that? For me I wash daily with conditioner and then an occasional ACV. My hair is v diff texture to yours though
4618 2018-03-07 15:05:33 Your MCM is running away from burning oil.
4619 2018-03-07 15:05:27 That is SUCH a good idea!  These people live in a unicorn world.  Maybe they should grow grass to feed them. and ride them as a form of transportation.  See how well they do without that oil and gas they just SO HATE!!!!

4627 2018-03-07 15:04:22 Did you know that before farmers settled on corn and soy to fatten their cattle, they tried coconut and it’s oil because it was cheap and plentiful. But the cattle got lean. Try a tablespoon a day. #coconut #lean #weightloss #fit #paleo #keto

4755 2018-03-07 14:50:38 The Trump and GOP interpretation of that is...inflict as much pain, cause as much chaos and protect and promote corporations as if they were people.  Oh yeah, pray at the alter of oil and coal.
4756 2018-03-07 14:50:14 I read all your tweets and appreciate the cold eye you cast on the figures.

But...

I get the feeling you’re clutching at straws here. The Arab oil embargo of October 1973 surely the catalyst there?

Doesn’t today’s Trade Deficit show US economy humming along?

4767 2018-03-07 14:49:21 As there are no tar sands of which I'm aware in Canada, where are the tar sands to which you refer? You do know that tar is derived from coal and not at all associated with oil? We do have oil sands which we are trying to clean up...

4769 2018-03-07 14:49:20 And here, when I just glanced at the start of your tweet, I thought we were going to learn about robots demanding more oil, cleaner power supplies and time off to meditate recursively.

4771 2018-03-07 14:49:06 In fairness, these are the same ppl who told us oil would be $200 forever, and Energy Poverty is a right wing conspiracy....
4772 2018-03-07 14:49:01 As someone who worked in the wind sector, I know that some of the first companies to jump into pushing bird-mincer were oil companies. And it later dawned on me why: energy companies benefit when energy prices go up, because they can sell less for more and make MORE profit.

Oil is awesome and the United States has a lot of it,  Oil is abiotic and renews itself,The earth is at its lowest on carbon ever recorded, we are lucky to have the ability to add carbon back in atmosphere

4790 2018-03-07 14:47:36 I've no idea,but which is cleanest overall? Oil ,gas or electric?
4791 2018-03-07 14:47:33 All signs point toward oil falling off a cliff, Equities holding the baton!
4792 2018-03-07 14:47:31 Hard to say, but my concern is that Flacco & accuracy are like oil & water. If you give him a WR with catch issues, it'll be more of the same. That's why our best WRs were hands guys. Boldin, Mason, Smitty, etc.
4793 2018-03-07 14:47:27 @SprigGourmet When living in India, we loved your roasted chilli oil. In Norway, we are not able to find it :( Do you deliver internationally? Or can you recomend a similar product that is available in Europe?

5144 2018-03-07 14:21:12 . A capsule or tablespoon of cod liver oil is more than enough to ensure you are consuming your recommended daily dose of vitamin D.(8)
5145 2018-03-07 14:20:46 Cod liver oil. The fish oil can be used as a remedy for muscle aches, heart disease, high (bad) cholesterol and diabetes, and even help prevent upper respiratory tract infections.

5148 2018-03-07 14:20:26 Absolut! Precis som nu när global cap kommer och de flesta väljer heavy fuel oil med skrubbers. Tyvärr görs sällan helhetsanalyser av denna typ av regler. I LNG frågan är det svaret från oss att det viktiga är att vi får till en teknikomställning! Sedan krävs morötter!
5149 2018-03-07 14:20:23 Cod liver oil
Cod liver is the best source of vitamin D in all the land and sea. Eating fish does not provide the amount of nutrients found in cod liver oil. A small amount goes a long way; a tablespoon of cod liver oil provides 1,360 IU’s of vitamin D per serving.

5191 2018-03-07 14:16:35 I'm sure that EIA is doing better than most could to predict future production and potential.  Certainly have the most complete data set for industry-wide.  But beyond 1 yr out, so much of that production is dependent on WTI price.  Budgets are annual and reviewed quarterly. #oil
5192 2018-03-07 14:16:30 Of course oil was the key reason. Of course it was.

Zinke claimed he was doing it to help fishers, hunters, and ranchers. But national monument status doesn't prohibit fishing, hunting, or ranching.

All it prohibits is drilling.

5339 2018-03-07 14:00:42 Normal rules do not apply in SA. The internal stresses and strains are significant. It is not simply about revenue streams from oil and oil derivative exports. The war in Yemen is as much about externalising those internal stresses.

5. Renewables - solar/wind can offset the damage
6. Consuming less energy helps
7. Electing officials who support renewables will save lives and $

5365 2018-03-07 13:57:55 Under NDP worst economy in Canada intil recently. Gains were in oil & gas. Highest unemployment. There is no economy diversification. There is not an increase in any infrastructure (which is mostly funded at federal level), there’s an increase in business insolvency. What a joke.
5366 2018-03-07 13:57:48 The Trade Deficit of the mid 00s was largely driven by imported oil...  as the price of oil crashed and domestic oil production ramped up, the oil related trade deficit was squashed.

This was a tremendous gift to GDP throughout this decade... but we've squandered that gift.

5438 2018-03-07 13:50:37 Of course it would and has done for years. They put politicians in to ensure it! Also in other parts of the world.  Afghanistan, Syria. They want their oil but those countries were harder to convince hence a war on terror-a war to get things cheaper. Everything is about money
5439 2018-03-07 13:50:16 Shutting down Alberta (Canadian) oil doesn't alleviate demand for the product. We simply import much dirtier oil and finance despotic regimes. Not to mention the list revenues that could go to alternative energy research. Great straw man. How's the Koolaid?
5440 2018-03-07 13:50:14 I love Collard Greens  great fiber and protein. Farmer markets have the best choices. Remember to wash well,cook in cold water, season with olive oil, sea salt. Brink to a boil, simmer until tender. Don't overcook, children  don't like mushy veggies.

Diversify to what? We are going deeper and deeper in DEBT. USA is eating our lunch, AGAIN! Oil growth #s don't lie.

5459 2018-03-07 13:47:11 @BrigidWD Disgraceful.  You expect people working for coal and oil companies to lie about coral bleaching and climate change, not guides working on the Great Barrier Reef!
5460 2018-03-07 13:47:08 rightttttt. My mom lathered my hair in coconut oil and shea moisture when I was younger, she made sure I loved my shit. I’m so grateful.
5461 2018-03-07 13:47:07 Week 5 day 1:
Today me and my group discussed that we are going to do a full power point to finish up our project that we did for our engine. We learned a lot from this engine but it’s time to move on and do real oil changes and fix good engines that work.
@Saltfleethort
5462 2018-03-07 13:46:46 outstanding commitment, thankyou x
5463 2018-03-07 13:46:46 Aww that’s the worst. Lavender oil and medicine for headaches usually work.
5464 2018-03-07 13:46:32 I think this is a great program every school should have. One of my lil cousins twice removed or whatever graduated from high school one weekend and community college the next. Got a serious leg up and now she works for an oil co in NO.
5465 2018-03-07 13:46:28 I wish the world wouldn't deal in arms, oil, gas, coal...we have so much potential on this planet and we squander it with profit and preoccupations with power wrought by injustice and war.
5466 2018-03-07 13:46:25 Ready Player One just spits out a reference to Midnight Oil, from the phrase “burning the midnight oil”.

5469 2018-03-07 13:45:51 I would put a light coat of tung oil on it and just set it on the mantle, your grace.

contains PALM OIL. The use of palm oil is causing vast deforestation. The recommendation from charities and trusts is not to use palm oil. Customers should be made aware of this at the store.

5516 2018-03-07 13:40:33 Lame response. The availability of alternative fuel powered vehicles has been limited by the power of oil and their support industry. We are beyond the need for oil the same as tge need for typewriters or horse drawn carriage. If oil disappeared tommorrow what do we do? Ready?

They are oil paintings. We regret the error.
5522 2018-03-07 13:39:24 Shocking service over the phone with your customer service advisors, only called to ask the capacity of gearbox oil my car takes and he refused to give the information, made an assumption I was incapable of carrying the work out myself and told me to take my car to audi@AudiUK
5523 2018-03-07 13:39:09 I suffered through. Why does no one challenge him w real data re guns & gun deaths? He slyly switches to data about crime in general & you sit there  mouths shut. Places with fewer guns have fewer gun deaths PERIOD. You’ve shown the data before. Show it to this snake oil salesman
5524 2018-03-07 13:39:07 Why your service charges are 100 SAR for oil filter and engine oil change? That's simply fleecing the customer

5574 2018-03-07 13:32:22 Oh, I agree. I still think that Bush Jr and Cheney should've been tried as war criminals.  They needlessly kicked a hornet's nest in the Middle East (for oil profiteering) that'll have repercussions for many generations.  That said?  Trump may very well tweet us into WW3...
5575 2018-03-07 13:32:21 Hi Nick, We are aware of the concerns regarding the use of palm oil. We can assure you that the small amount of palm oil used comes from traceable sustainable sources and our supplier is registered.....
5576 2018-03-07 13:32:18 Wells Fargo is also staffed by 56% women and headquartered in San Francisco, maybe one of the most liberal cities in the US. 

It's called serving a diverse clientele, or put a different way, America.
5577 2018-03-07 13:32:14 Most primers, specially those containing silicone, will contribute to shifting so avoid them. I really like @GarnierSA's BB for oily skin. It sits tight! Using an oil blotting sheet every three or so hours will also help remove oil throughout the day and mitigate a slide.
5578 2018-03-07 13:32:08 Hopefully this oil change don’t take them 5 years

5584 2018-03-07 13:31:22 I haven't used the chainsaw for about 3 years. It started really easily! Will cut some wood up later today. But it did leak all of its chain oil into the storage box, so quite a mess to clear up.

5587 2018-03-07 13:31:05 This is insane. Now they turn on the Saudi Crown Prince because he’s a revolutionary leader? Because he wants to bring SA into the 21st century?  Their oil fields are drying up. They’re plagued by terrorism. He’s trying to save his nation. Evolve or die.

5597 2018-03-07 13:30:22 The Potent Pink Grapefruit
It  has been proven to stimulate the lymphatic system.  The essential oil (once diluted) has beneficial toning and astringent effects for the skin.

5598 2018-03-07 13:30:14 So has anyone started formulated a Plan B for once the Transmountain pipeline expansion project breathes its last gasp of air? Just wondering as it seems that Alberta, Big Oil, etc. are treating it like it is the hill to die on. #BCpoli #Ableg #Abpoli #Cdnpoli #Canpoli
5599 2018-03-07 13:29:56 your country is  wealthy! OIL
The health system is great! Oil
The infrastructure is good...Oil

5600 2018-03-07 13:29:45 My Mom made me a while line of coco mademoiselle lotion and soaps. I made me a new body and hair oil with coco mademoiselle and vanilla it's sooo Baum good smelling.
5601 2018-03-07 13:29:37 Just in time for hybrids and electronic vehicles.
China leads in hydroelectric and solar electricity.

Maybe we should lobby for the return of whale oil and coal, too.
Oh, wait...
5602 2018-03-07 13:29:36 PURE CASTOR OIL IS NOW OUT OF STOCK!

but dont worry, i’ll restock it soon and i akan buat cod lagi ya. thanks to everyone who bought it! uguys are the real mvp! 
5603 2018-03-07 13:29:35 John and positivity are like oil and water.  Tweeter would be boring if he changed.  
5604 2018-03-07 13:29:35 This coconut oil has my skin feeling so incredibly lush. Whew.
5605 2018-03-07 13:29:33 @Babymild_Psy มาแล้วนะเจ้าคะ เปิดๆ พี่หมื่นรออยู่
5606 2018-03-07 13:29:16 i use a dryer, that powder & hair oil. you might wanna try a tiny bit of the latter
5607 2018-03-07 13:29:14 I was thinking more Engine Oil, Coolant, Brake Fluid and screenwash, but that works too!
5608 2018-03-07 13:29:01 That will be great if you can bring back America , we are producing more oil then ever way is are gas prices keep going up.think you president Trump the people's president.2018 big majority 2020 The people's president.
5609 2018-03-07 13:28:50 After all a lot of the companies that own oil are also companies working on more eco-friendly solutions to all we have to do is threaten to take their tax breaks from them if they don't spend some of this new profit on cleaner energy
5610 2018-03-07 13:28:39 Yes! Yes! You are the lone voice pointing out how ridiculous it is that the entire oil industry cowers before the efforts of a few environmental funders. #ableg
5611 2018-03-07 13:28:37 Ryan Trump & GOP HAVE BEEN BOUGHT BY KOCH & CRONIES to do away with taxes on rich & to get rid of ALL HEALTH & SAFETY REGULATIONS ON THEIR OIL/FOSSIL FUELS BUSINESSES!!! This is about Koch Cronies planning to enslave Americans to the rich corporate 1%!!Vote KOCH GOP OUT IN 2018!
5612 2018-03-07 13:28:34 No estoy hablando de tecnicismos. Lo que trato de decir es simple: si los oil majors entre 2015-2017 vieron mermadas sus ganancias al punto de endeudarse para pagar dividendos crees que a PDVSA le fué mejor? 2.200 millones es riqueza vzla o solo ingresos por factura petrolera?
5613 2018-03-07 13:28:32 Hot olive oil pour it in your ear
5614 2018-03-07 13:28:29 @NatashaAkpoti you have opened our eyes with truth. 

One can only imagine what is going on in the oil and gas industry.
5615 2018-03-07 13:28:20 I'd go with using ibuprofen to ease the pain and any inflammation...if it gets worse/notic3 discharge don't put olive oil or any other drops in coz that can make it worse and you'd most likely have to see a doc.
5616 2018-03-07 13:28:12 I’m at work smelling like coconut oil, cocoa butter, rosehip oil, pomegranate oil, chic pea, lentil, mushrooms, etc, etc, etc.....
5617 2018-03-07 13:28:12 There's nothing that says we can't pursue oil and renewable energy we just need to work harder on the latter
5618 2018-03-07 13:27:56 Lo unico que voy a decir es que la religion en vez de unirnos nos separan
5619 2018-03-07 13:27:46 It is not what enters a man that defiles him. Which that Jesus declared all food clean. Ayurvedic medicine will have you test your pee with peanut oil. It’s old. Scattering is noticed. So Santa clause is like a fly on the wall that eats elf shit and drinks Eskimo piss.
5620 2018-03-07 13:27:08 Olbas oil is the devil’s work
5621 2018-03-07 13:27:07 We lost the trade war with over regulation, very high Corp taxes, open borders, welfare state, imported oil & de-coalification. We aren’t looking to check imbalances with our new competitiveness. We want every new plant built to be in the USA!
5622 2018-03-07 13:27:02 I am a veteran with PTSD. One guess what I need? In Colorado I was able to legally vape cannabis oil & it was the first time in 20 years that I was able to go get groceries w/o having a panic attack. PS. YES I’ve tried ALL the other things.
5623 2018-03-07 13:26:37 I imagine historians are burning the midnight oil to keep up with daily events. Never ever anything even close to this bizarre Presidency. The rapid pace of absurdity and atrocity is mind boggling. They must be exhausted, I am!!!!

5626 2018-03-07 13:26:30 Congress uses legal jargon to bully the people.
5627 2018-03-07 13:26:24 Big oil has declared war on the world's democracies.  They are dictating to us how things are going to be done.
5628 2018-03-07 13:26:10 A drop of olive oil and lemon juice to an ice cube then running it over your face gives you better results than some most skin care products
5629 2018-03-07 13:25:56 puas pikir. ni tahun 2018. takkan bulan 15 plak. confirm bulan 3. so takkan nak pakai cleansing oil tu dalam seminggu je. konfirm tkkn habis
5630 2018-03-07 13:25:49 Mahal talaga mediheal eh. Watsons had yung foil sheet mask ni Yoongi dati around 180 siya. Yung kay Hoseok naman na tea tree oil na regular sheet mask lang is 30,000 won per pack (10 sheets)
5631 2018-03-07 13:25:42 Wise choices and Donald Trump are like oil and water.
5632 2018-03-07 13:25:28 This one looks like a bottle that has been disfigured by pouring hot oil into it
5633 2018-03-07 13:25:21 IMPORTANT
Now With the good Locked AIDS foods ( prev. HIV FOODS) the use of
Daily 4-5 drops Castor Oil
Daily 6-8 drops Coconut Oil
Should do some notes explaining some stuff
5634 2018-03-07 13:25:16 You’re making another assumption, McAdoo may have been a snake oil salesman and over-estimated his offense. But he’s been in the league a long time w/ a lot of exposure to QBs. I’m sure he has some level of insight into evaluating young QBs.
5635 2018-03-07 13:25:10 @RYOBIpowertools Hi, My Ryobi chainsaw RCS4040CA leaks all of its chain lubricating oil when it is stored (not from the filler cap). Any ideas?
5636 2018-03-07 13:25:08 It took around 50 years for US to turn around the energy market , we allowed foreign nations to dominate the gas and oil industry . Washington has a very short memory , they are going to make the same mistake again i.e. Steel & Aluminum . Depend on China for Steel ?

5638 2018-03-07 13:24:53 Hmm, I think he showed his intent months ago when in concert w/ Trump he SHUTTERED the office that enforces sanctions & dismissed staff
He has recently reminded ppl that he said he would stay out of OIL for O N E year, almost up.
5639 2018-03-07 13:24:52 Ran close to 50 laps before an oil leak... which may have damaged the engine.  Engine change.
5640 2018-03-07 13:24:51 Hey Elena ... are the migrants bringing real Italian Olive Oil from their home countries?
5641 2018-03-07 13:24:43 Just in bed trying to wish away the pain from the hot oil that splashed on literally all of my left hand and wristJesus please
5642 2018-03-07 13:24:39 I need some new windshield wipers and tires and an oil change that’s bout a million dollars worth of work right there #Adulting
5643 2018-03-07 13:24:32 So let me get this straight:

Dependence on foreign oil: Bad
Dependence on foreign metals: Good

Didn't Ford have a ridiculously expensive and long recall and people died because of substandard Chinese steel?

Trump isn't wrong about everything. /1
5644 2018-03-07 13:24:30 i put exacto knife into the floor it just was cooking oil
5645 2018-03-07 13:24:28 Omg I kept yanking it & I couldn't get it unwrapped so finally I just pulled it out .i got a massage yesterday & this lady put so much oil in my hair & massaged my scalp forever & my hair looked like a perm when she was done .i thought oh god I have to go to the store

5647 2018-03-07 13:24:10 Great. You know the world is moving towards more sustainable energy sources though, right? But oil jobs, right????
5648 2018-03-07 13:24:09 Apparently his genius plan is to turn off the oil flowing through the pipeline they don’t want anyway. What’s he going to do after that, lower their property values?
5649 2018-03-07 13:24:05 Pour one teaspoons of olive oil then whisk briskly.
5650 2018-03-07 13:24:01 Steward, look at the list of big corps, lead in gas, pcbs, murcury, asbestos in breaks etc, lead in paint, cigirates, cooking oil history.........story line it want hurt you. Profit is......fill in the blank
5651 2018-03-07 13:23:56 I’m helping my old man fix oil wells this week. We almost dropped a 3,000 lb pump jack on my brother and myself yesterday. Safe to say OSHA would have a field day out here. #SpringBreak
5652 2018-03-07 13:23:41 If you have time to roast some potatoes, then add a couple of teaspoons of @marmite to the roasting tin (preferably with goose fat, though your roasting oil of choice will do)... I guarantee you'll be converted...

5728 2018-03-07 13:14:55 I was speaking in a global sense about the demand for oil, but if you take it locally with CC, the issue was the Cockpit Country itself. Public opinion led that fight. Can't speak my full mind in public about it. 
5729 2018-03-07 13:14:52 Maybe the guy who slept in his car had the right idea.  No property taxes, just gas, oil, and maintenance.

5732 2018-03-07 13:14:35 Sadly if you remove the fact that they were investing in oil and gas plays it sounds like every syndicated mortgage company in Canada.
5733 2018-03-07 13:14:35 .@realDonaldTrump It seems to me that if cheap steel was a threat to national security, we should establish a strategic reserve, like with oil, and buy up and store all the cheap steel we can. Wouldn't hurt our manufacturers, would cost the Chinese. They lose more money.
5734 2018-03-07 13:14:30 It's because the mechanics are having an oil fight in the back.
5735 2018-03-07 13:14:30 For aftercare, try using a massage oil
5736 2018-03-07 13:14:17 You've probably cooked it by now... but we just roast it with olive oil and salt (sometimes smocked paprika) for a looooong time. Simple and amaaaazing.
5737 2018-03-07 13:14:03 When you get out a new roll of toilet paper, place a few drops of your favorite essential oil in the cardboard tube of the toilet paper.
5738 2018-03-07 13:13:34 Nice short clip before the wheel falls off or it springs an oil leak..
5739 2018-03-07 13:13:13 Okay so CBD oil is R A N K  like I’m intrigued to see if it helps my joint pain / eczema / anxiety but FUCK I actually gagged
5740 2018-03-07 13:13:08 When the cost is weighed in millions of jobs & a likely Depression, stopping the cheating won’t matter. Makes better sense to cut regs, crush unions, do whatever is needed to make these industries more competitive. Look at what our oil industry has done.
5741 2018-03-07 13:13:03 It’s an act and there are people who will buy his snake oil
5742 2018-03-07 13:13:02 I’d loathe another oil owner. Even if it meant matching city’s spending. Fan ownership!
5743 2018-03-07 13:13:01 We don't need a polar ice cap!  Once it melts, it will be easy to drill for oil there! #ClimateChange #GlobalWarming
5744 2018-03-07 13:12:38 Apparently there was a jackknifed semi with an oil spill so compounded with the Strawberry festival it’s a huge mess!

5746 2018-03-07 13:12:30 Making cannabis oil is very dangerous because of the huge quantities of butane used - making cannabis oil is more likely to cause an explosion than not - in fact so much more likely to explode than a fridge ever is...
5747 2018-03-07 13:12:06 Every semblance of religion that is not derived from Christ, by faith in his name, is, at the best, like a lamp without oil.

energy -oil and gas plentiful yet prices rise..

5753 2018-03-07 13:11:27 I've felt for years now that big oil is directly involved in this world's problems. Their back needs broken by renewables.
5754 2018-03-07 13:11:14 Their oil comes from Texas via many pipelines. Ours comes from Alberta and Saskatchewan with one pipeline that the Mayor of Burnaby wants plugged.

5767 2018-03-07 13:09:17 Yes! There’s different advice every day. Do drink, don’t drink, eat coconut oil, don’t eat coconut oil, none of the experts agree with each other. Everything in moderation should work for everyone.
5768 2018-03-07 13:09:10 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.

5797 2018-03-07 13:05:47 Do you think that might have anything to do with how easy it is to accomplish that? Almost everything coming out of his administration could be viewed as negative depending on whether you think he is the greatest president ever or a snake oil salesman. Faux News.

5803 2018-03-07 13:05:16 ANZ says concerns that rising US shale production will offset OPEC cuts have  weakened bullish oil price momentum; as synchronised global growth continues, base metals demand looks healthy, despite an expected slowdown in China.

5854 2018-03-07 12:56:25 Our educational system is trash. Something needs to be done. Our government values oil and gas more than students.
5855 2018-03-07 12:56:00 You can start with learning how to check your oil! Easiest first skill to learn and one of the most important things you can do for your car.
5856 2018-03-07 12:55:38 For those who have joint problems and didn't know what to take - fish oil works wonders. Ensure that it's part of your daily supplements.
5857 2018-03-07 12:55:29 No new oil drilling. Period! Green energy is what moves America forward, so sorry to all the old white rich oil tycoons, but America needs to advance with the rest of the world, not stay stuck in old habits to benefit 1%.
5858 2018-03-07 12:55:29 You are so right. I’ve travelled to Nigeria more than once & it’s shocking how poor 99% of the popln is despite huge oil with & massive aid. Why? 2/3rds of everything is stolen & money shipped offshore.
5859 2018-03-07 12:55:01 Umm. No Daniel. Historic performance based on non producing assets at $30 oil vs today circa 150-175 BOPD with oil at $62-65. Simple maths fella. You were 15x out on Twin well flow pal. As a share blogger you should be impartial and not emotionally attached imo

5862 2018-03-07 12:54:44 Soap has historically contained animal fat/oil. I have a bar of soap made after deer hunting season was completed here in Western NY. So you've probably in your life have used a lot of soap with animal oil and didn't know it.
5863 2018-03-07 12:54:33 .@nytimes recalls some fallout of Tillerson's time in Africa before SecState when he was at Exxon: "2012, an Economic Community of West African States court ruled that Exxon, along with other oil companies, violated human rights in Nigeria’s oil-rich Niger Delta."

Sadly it's all going overseas and Trump's letting our gas prices go up, up, up.

5871 2018-03-07 12:53:55 Real problem is....BOTH ARE BAD!!

We can vastly reduce oil dependence by switching to alternative energy sources, like eletric cars, solar & wind energy. 

Stop killing the planet!
5872 2018-03-07 12:53:48 No. We will build our steel plants, ramp up production, and drive the cost down with higher quality. If someone else controls the market, they control the price. Just    Like   OIL
5873 2018-03-07 12:53:43 Ole is white moimoi. The one the prepare with groundnut oil. Like Ofuloju
5874 2018-03-07 12:53:38 $ugaz has been a true test of my paitence for sure, anticipated a multi day not a multi week swing, but the chart held up. I do see gold ready to plummet on a dollar rally. Ideally going LONG sub 1300. Oil headed to 58 or lower very soon. IMO

5881 2018-03-07 12:52:21 Interesting article. Thanks. Palm oil won't dissapear totally I fear. It def. has to get out of "greenfuels"! And no new deforestation, only plantations on already cut-down areas.

5884 2018-03-07 12:51:44 Very important as Cotten seed oil is  frequently used as food/feed ingredient.
5885 2018-03-07 12:51:39 And as a result, choosing to buy conflict oil, supporting dictatorships and human rights abuses.  It is Canada's shame.

5901 2018-03-07 12:48:57 They should name an oil spill for him
5902 2018-03-07 12:48:54 Glad to hear!! I had a couple battle scars with past cats too. The most amusing one was getting a fat lip after my cat stuck her claw in it trying to get out of the bath when I was trying to wash oil off her fur after she'd been under a car hood. Friends thought I'd been fighting
5903 2018-03-07 12:48:46 Les Demoiselles d'Avignon is a large oil painting created in 1907 by the Spanish artist Pablo Picasso. The work portrays five nude female prostitutes from a brothel on Carrer d'Avinyó in Barcelona. @apkarthistory
5904 2018-03-07 12:48:31 Who seriously thinks that those manufacturing jobs are coming back? Oh yeah, the poor people who elected this snake oil salesman.

We will get some jobs here and there (in the thousands), but the 6 million jobs are gone. Move on, he’s lying to you.
5905 2018-03-07 12:48:20 Oil?
5906 2018-03-07 12:48:02 ooh you got split ends? I recommend cutting it and applying coconut hair mask. Before going to bed apply a lot of coconut oil. Massage scalp and the tips. Then in the morning wash it off with mild shampoo and conditioner. Do this Once a week or twice if you feel itchy scalp.
5907 2018-03-07 12:48:00 “A story isn't a charcoal sketch, where every stroke lies on the surface to be seen. It's an oil painting, filled with layers that the author must uncover so carefully to show its beauty.” ― Amelia Atwater-Rhodes
5908 2018-03-07 12:47:47 I know they take money from big oil. Many of them push for fracking like mad. So that's why no environmental issues. They feel they must protect Joe "Coal" Manchin and Heidi "Oil" Heitkamp.  My guess they are taking money somewhere from the private prison industry.

5933 2018-03-07 12:43:51 Ryan Zinke knows as much about reality & climate change as a meadow muffin (cow patty for thise west of the Mississippi). Oil exploration was a big part of the Bears Ears shrinking.  Got to take care of Koch Bros. & Big Oil.
5934 2018-03-07 12:43:41 Ah, worried about the birds are we? I think it’s more worry about loss of money in your pocket from oil and gas lobby and companies! How silly of me! You really are a conservationist at heart! Who knew?! BS!

5965 2018-03-07 12:39:46 It's my belief that Governments & Scientists (who are funded by Governments) are pushing climate change so they can tax us more (carbon tax etc) & so we will go out & spend our money to go "green", which helps the economy. Big oil doesn't care because we will continue to use it
5966 2018-03-07 12:39:46 The next big thing after oil is data, I believe that's what @ibadancmd is preaching. Advanced countries like US, Japan, UK, Germany etc are already leveraging on Data to better develop their countries and give wealth to their people.

6009 2018-03-07 12:33:06 Yeah common sense. Solar panels are made with plastic and wires, both made by FF. Turbines are made of metal and lubricated with oil. Both serviced by men in trucks built and fueled with FF. ETC ETC ETC
6010 2018-03-07 12:32:51 Why are you sending out of date videos? You do know oil brings in partially no revenue now? Oh, yo didn’t know that? 
6011 2018-03-07 12:32:15 Great article on #AI!
Jobs not at risk; good analogy #ATMs didn't kill #Banks but grew jobs; plus the insight that #data is critical.
Many say data is the new oil; but as @dez_blanchfield says "Data is the new Oxygen!"

6027 2018-03-07 12:30:58 There is no straight comparison. Our government uses human rights abuses to justify some foreign policy decisions. Then ignores hideous rights abuses and funds genocidal regimes if our trade or oil threatened. At the same time as leaving the EU. They make no  bloody sense at all

6129 2018-03-07 12:12:20 Clearly you are not aware of the geologically unique qualities of Scottish oil. it's a substance quite unlike any other in that it reacts to political climate, it contracts with any prospect of Scottish independence and otherwise expands.

6213 2018-03-07 11:58:32 Concluding from your comment that US pushed Syria into civil war for free oil, question still stands: are those who (read ISIS) Asad is killing opposed to selling oil to USA? Are Middle Eastern people so gullible?

6299 2018-03-07 11:42:11 Oil prices fell on Wednesday, pulled down by weaker share markets after a key advocate for free trade in the U.S. government resigned.

Soaring U.S. crude oil production and rising inventories were also weighing on crude prices, traders said.

6312 2018-03-07 11:40:58 @mrjamesob 
While the Saudis are here we could pressure them to up oil production. The ensuing glut would drive oil prices down, and that would badly devalue Russia's exports, crippling its economy.

(I don't favour this action, but just answering your question "What can we do?")

6573 2018-03-07 10:53:00 Seven more weeks of radiation treatments. I sure hope that it gets it all this time. Wanting to paint as it does keep my mind off the pain and process but getting pretty tired. Got two more oil on canvass commissions this month.

6597 2018-03-07 10:49:47 That might be one of the most ignorant comment ever. US domestic oil production is now one of if not the largest in the world, and we are exporting again. The stupid dialectic of 2001 was stupid then, and it's comedic now

6600 2018-03-07 10:49:07 Mr piers! Have you ever condemned The British for killing thousands in iraq  for oil?
6601 2018-03-07 10:47:59 Because the Saudis have OIL.
6602 2018-03-07 10:47:09 Quadra Oil and Gas Ltd,is a MANDATE to Russian Oil and Gas Direct Seller and we can supply the following petroleum products virginD6 oil,aviation kero. JP54 jet fuel,pet.coke,bitumen 60/90 - 90/130,base oil SN 100 - SN 500. for further enquiries email us quadraoilandgas@gmail.com
6603 2018-03-07 10:46:46 Successive British governments have supported the hideous Saudi regime for dodgy reasons of oil & money, and for slightly less dodgy reasons of realpolitik and regional stability.
Corbyn supports the equally hideous Iranian theocracy for no reason other than he like them.
6604 2018-03-07 10:46:40 OF COURSE the weather was sunny and amazing when I was changing oil and filters and now it's about to rain when I'm ready to ride
6605 2018-03-07 10:46:17 Wahabism started in the 18th century inside the Arabian peninsula. The British first supported Hussein but Saud defeated him so they switched sides. The gifts etc was common British practice. It actually was the US who uplifted the Saudis after discovery of oil
6606 2018-03-07 10:45:54 Just add some dolphins frolicking in the oil spill and we're golden
6607 2018-03-07 10:45:31 @Babsino20 comma see
6608 2018-03-07 10:45:25 Oil and huh? I think surfs up, so it's time to leave with your martian friends dork 
6609 2018-03-07 10:45:23 Well he has finally typed something but this should destroy his whol #blackbox thinking snake oil he has built up and can he actually quote where he has been cautious ? The leading cheerleader of Brailsfraud
6610 2018-03-07 10:45:19 We don’t actually HAVE to buy Saudi oil...
6611 2018-03-07 10:45:11 I believe the county was allocated 10B+ and hopefully its share form Oil revenues can in the future be put to great use.

6615 2018-03-07 10:44:34 day after that. People can't care about everything and eventually we get overloaded and we overlook everything but the most immediate problems. The south just happens to be too far removed for people to pay attention. It's sad but closing of an oil pipeline is more important that
6616 2018-03-07 10:44:25 Coconut oil is brilliant for anything like that, if it’s mites/live they’ll wantvtreating but if just dry skin coconut is the way forward. Works a treat on us too!!
6617 2018-03-07 10:44:20 #kltu KARAK HWAY: An oil spill is the cause of a 40 minute delay from Genting Sempah - heading towards KL #PetronTrafficUpdate #Waze
6618 2018-03-07 10:44:14 Again. You're missing the point.  If that was true and you folllow "crude oil" prices... Then why weren't all three petrol stations the same price? They differed by 5p per litre!? On the same day!!!

6629 2018-03-07 10:42:33 Well it’s a stimulant that has many benefits but if over used it is truly harmful.  Medical marijuana and it’s effects are good , the oil has a lot of unknow uses .

6632 2018-03-07 10:42:06 Nope. I won't forget what you did! The lives you cost in your pursuit take over Iraq's oil wells. You're just as horrible but in a slightly different way in that you, at least, didn't conspire with Russia to bring our country down. But you were just as horrible! I'll remember...
6633 2018-03-07 10:41:45 the oil on that damn pillar made me smell like lube for a week

6713 2018-03-07 10:28:00 To be fair, neither the article nor agency say the oil’s going to run out. It says that production will fall due to lack of investment. There’s an issue to go after there, but the ‘running out’ myth isn’t it

6999 2018-03-07 09:38:08 From the other side of the Atlantic, it looks as though your citizens very much gave their power away - to big business, Russian oligarchs, oil industry, Trump’s family, extended family and millionaire/billionaire buddies. Meanwhile average Joe gets sweet fk all.

7008 2018-03-07 09:36:51 As part of the government efforts,  they had to reintroduce the subsidy so that the pump price is not increased. There's is scarcity because subsidy was not provided for in the budget as the sudden rise in crude oil was not expected.

7010 2018-03-07 09:36:21 You said it, we do. But tRump can’t figure out how to get a piece of that pie. Maybe later, once he has all our coastal lands  drilled for oil.  I hate being dragged back to 1950’s era fuel and energy schemes. Coal?  Even the miners said no on that one.

7013 2018-03-07 09:35:26 Madam nobody lied to anybody. There was partial deregulation. We all need to stop reading for all this third party media organisation. Selling PMS without the subsidy was working until the price of crude oil went up. Nigerians would have cried to heavens if there was no cussion

7040 2018-03-07 09:29:46 It is the role of the unionist MSM, commentators & think-tanks to cast doubt on any/all benefits of being independent. Every good news story on (eg) oil must be countered and given undue prominence.

7047 2018-03-07 09:27:40 Really surprised to see $slb's share price is back around 2016 lows. Oil prices have pretty much doubled since then, and there's a huge global backlog of CapEx that has to replace depletion.

7058 2018-03-07 09:24:59 Saudi Arabia wants UK to increase supply in the bazaar of KSA. Hence, foreign policy will be in a contest of Oil Marketing. Also, it is in the interest of UK to compare the relevance of production & material at Brexit follow up. @guardian @BBC @TheSun @DailyMirror @SkyNews
7059 2018-03-07 09:24:40 Seems a fundamental driver is an authoritarian regime invoking #Nationalism for a domestic audience, as a tactic for power consolidation.  It doesn't make them any less dangerous but more for #Greece & with oil & gas in the mix, for #Cyprus & #Egypt as well, I think.
7060 2018-03-07 09:24:40  I’ve decided I’m not buying any more Oreos after this pack runs out... didn’t realize until recently just how bad palm oil was.. less Oreos + helping environment = 
7061 2018-03-07 09:24:08 So let me get this straight: post Brexit Britain will prostitute itself to a country run undemocratically by a single family so it can have their Bns of oil money as inward investment? #saudiukvisit #saudi

7104 2018-03-07 09:16:34 Obviously a barrel of oil outside Russia cost more than $1. So some enterprising men bought the oil internally, sold it externally, and made fortunes. And not just with oil. Other resources too. if you want to know how the Russian oligarchs came about, that's how.
7105 2018-03-07 09:16:07 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, but they go out fast.
7106 2018-03-07 09:16:00 Yes you will get any form of excuse as to why it doesn’t work and you will find any amount of snake oil commentators to pile on the detractors bandwagon to further there own agendas ...  beam me up Scotty  no intelligent life down here 
7107 2018-03-07 09:15:28 The hot boiling oil  looks to be as cold as the Atlantic Ocean #mkr
7108 2018-03-07 09:15:23 Thank you, but that's not possible.  I didn't realise the oil was frozen until I unpacked.  I can't be expected to sort through all my bags of shopping checking each item before the driver leaves?
7109 2018-03-07 09:15:21 They opened up a competitive market and free pricing overnight under Yeltsin. Literally overnight. But they kept utilities prices capped. So a barrel of oil in Russia was pegged at $1. But because it was now a free market, you could sell it outside Russia.
7110 2018-03-07 09:15:12 That sounds great - if a bit challenging! Have you got him downing vegetable oil by the mugful?
7111 2018-03-07 09:14:55 You saying Haakimaa not Muslim? This Raees keep lying abt the black market oil trade which involves Maldivian ship. Then arrested a Maldivian to investigate the case. Haakimaa also accused of a murder case & Sihr.

7113 2018-03-07 09:14:31 These kids never had any oil or resourses. They have only their lifes. They should not die for such stupid macro geopolitics. Right now they should save their lifes and campaign for a SURRENDER OF THE REBELs. You might want them to die for your world view!
7114 2018-03-07 09:14:13 US 6th fleet must have accomplished its mission in Crimea & the Black Sea (!) if its now being deployed to support ExxonMobil oil research vessels in east med!
7115 2018-03-07 09:14:00 Consider this. In 2 years oil price went $80>$147>$35>$80 while physical supply/demand varied by 3%. A market gone mad - but a fantastically profitable casino. #OOTT
7116 2018-03-07 09:13:52 wow if someone said that about a woman, like you're no oil painting love
7117 2018-03-07 09:13:41 This is a poisonous and dysfunctional relationship, they can't stand each other, they're staying together for convenience, the arms deals and the oil. When this relationship is no longer paying dividends there will be a divorce and it will be nasty
7118 2018-03-07 09:13:26 Oops yes palm oil is a problem. I can't seem to get away from it. There's a vegan store near me and some of their products contain palm oil speads etc..maybe I should start calling myself a plant based person instead bc not sure I can honestly cut it out 100%

7128 2018-03-07 09:11:32 Nope. Market price formtation will revert to physical supply & demand instead of financial supply & demand as now. Commodities 101. If producers can support market prices, they will (as they have on & off for a decade). But oil downside is limited by cost of production #OOTT

with no growth (Venezuela falling, Canada can’t get it out) all heavy crude oil is already accounted for in the crude/product balance. Where will shale buyers find more heavy crude to blend?Is heavy crude the reverse diluent problem that Venezuela has?

7175 2018-03-07 09:02:43 The fascinating thing about it all had nothing to do with Bill Nye even being there, but rather how @JustinTrudeau rationalized the KM decision with his slow transition explanation. making absolutely no mention at all of allowing an increase in oil tankers or spills in BC.
7176 2018-03-07 09:02:13 Bottom level. Test result tough few weeks away, late march but price will build up for the result. Good result, massive upside potential. De-risking of 100+ mbbls oil, $484m = 2.20p

7179 2018-03-07 09:01:58 I guess its better to use home remedy.  Perhaps plants. If you have aloe vera, witch hazel (like a clear solution), vinegar (one used in cooking)  tea tree oil or used tea bag, you can try one if these and hold it against your itch. But be sure to take care of the hygiene.

7246 2018-03-07 08:50:17 US will produce over 10.6bn of oil this year which is similar to Saudi's levels of production. Will there be oversupply, or growth in China will absorb the extra supply?

7392 2018-03-07 08:22:24 Not by genetic, yes, I will give you that. But it is in effect. As it's a form of superiority not grounded in provable fact.  But again you are correct in saying it is, although not functionally, different then racism.

7524 2018-03-07 07:55:21 Yeah oil, wind, sea, water, don't need any of them. No benefit to an economy at all. Imagine though if the UK Gov hadn't typically arsed up, we could be generating even more from oil, you know, like Norway does (cue disproved excuses).

And for the connection. People assert some "privilege" based on race/sex, yet lack any hard or meaningful evidence that can stand up to even a little scrutiny. As such they punish these "privileged" based not on fact, but on opinion. 

Which is fucking racist.

Privilege theory, which has absolutely no right at all to use the word theory, SHOULD be finding out what kind of privilege any group had at any particular time. However it's used to assert, without real evidence, that any race or sex is privileged in the US wrongly.

Racism, technically, is about thinking literally any race has a genetic advantage over literally any other. But that's dumb because races factually have pros and cons. The common use is wrongly thinking one race is better, or applying an average to an individual.

7942 2018-03-07 06:28:06 Yeah sure, fatten the pockets of POTUS friends. How about great family wage jobs for our people? How about reducing OPEC and Russian monopolies on oil and natural gas and becoming self dependent with energy resources? This alone hurts russia more than any sanctions can.

7962 2018-03-07 06:23:49 tea tree and coconut oil!! the tea tree disinfects your face and coconut oil moisturizes and leaves your face dewy! It’s what I use daily and for just these 2 things costs all together not even $20 :))
7963 2018-03-07 06:23:24 Before spending a fortune on your morning almond milk and gluten free oatmeal with organic chia seeds coated with flaxseed oil, ask yourself is this shit going to grant a cuntwaffle like myself immortality? if the answer is no, have an Oreo McFlurry instead and stop being a dildo

7987 2018-03-07 06:18:32 The fact that you refer to Houston as a “Little City” shows how ignorant and stupid you really are. Soon to be 3rd largest city in the US, also oil/gas headquarters for the country. But there’s no money here...

7992 2018-03-07 06:17:04 Dating back virtually to the day oil was struck in the Timor Sea. No government has clean hands.
7993 2018-03-07 06:16:59 It only makes sense if those making the chemical attacks are the ones wanting US involvement. The US wants control of Syria's oil. Put the pieces together.
7994 2018-03-07 06:16:58 no, no, no! it's this new lip scrub i've been making at home! *loops my arm around yours and drags you to my kitchen* it's brown sugar, honey, peppermint extract and just a tiny bit of olive oil. you've gotta try some.

8001 2018-03-07 06:15:39 You can't run a campaign w out money...that's reality. The problems are: Citizens United that allows the flow of tons of Dark Money into esp GOPers campaigns which makes them beholden to these usually corrupt donors like the NRA & Big Oil. These agendas are corrupt. 1/
8002 2018-03-07 06:15:28 Tyler I have really liked this niche youve carved, with the Oil Kings and WHL prospects.

8011 2018-03-07 06:13:08 Mexico's underinvested maquiladora cheated the US trough trilateral NAFTA. Therefore not much $ for US there except coil & oil imports. NAFTA is taking now taking heat, so Nieto wants @PEMEX to upstream to state controlled LUKOIL instead. Proof sanctions worked on @Russia.

8018 2018-03-07 06:11:47 You can’t take it out afterwards. You have condition + oil after (very little)  and leave it until all your sweat is dry.....and sometimes it still won’t come out as good as you want it. BUT it won’t look like how it does right after you take it down after working out.
8019 2018-03-07 06:11:36 California’s oil production is 2.7 % of its economy bringing in 66 billion dollars a year and 40 billion in taxes.. and leftists hate this?
8020 2018-03-07 06:11:35 Racism is structurally disenfranchising a group of people based on stereotypes and discriminatory beliefs. Privilege theory is a way of understanding how our history of white supremacy/male domination continues to influence our power structures today.

8033 2018-03-07 06:09:16 The trash was methods to show absurd reasoning.. To distract or by enough time to get rid of evidence in USA. Maybe trump promised Russia oil rigs in syria for help in presdential election to keep his hands clean.

8044 2018-03-07 06:07:22 isn’t it weird that you can add a drop of an oil into your foundation to help give a nice radiant finish to your makeup, but you can also use oil to breakdown your makeup and take it all off?

8052 2018-03-07 06:05:21 So re #55strong and last RTs: 

Nobody knows what’s going on? Again? 

I guess the gov passed the increase but explicitly/implicitly makes cuts to Medicare (instead of cutting massive oil tax breaks). 

I suspect there’s a union vote tonight but looks like it’s over? Will see.

8056 2018-03-07 06:04:52 We should just agree it is false promise and react to it politically at the polls. AP definitely does not ‘deserve’ SS with its super rich agri coastal areas (your Vizag photos look like foreign city), educated youth, untapped oil & gas, minerals, etc.

8062 2018-03-07 06:04:03 I disagree. 

I see nuge flipped for a RH dman in the Faulk/Barrie/category, and Klefbom moved for a winger. 

The only saving grace is Mclellan loves Nuge, although he appears to be fed up with Klefbom.

8077 2018-03-07 06:01:15 Maroon has far better hands in tight, which was part of the reason he was a good fit w/ McDavid. As far as RNH goes, unless they get a top flight D man for him, which they won't, we will see 97, 29 and 93 all playing inside the Oilers Top-Six on a regular basis in 2018-19.
8078 2018-03-07 06:01:13 "Ethical oil sands"?! Nice spin job. No wonder you do so well in politics. Might work for some, but unfortunately for you Canadians are smart enough to look past your words. How much of your donor base is oil sands corporations?

8086 2018-03-07 06:00:19 I thought he’d hit 50 if he spent 70% of just time with Mcdavid this year. 

He’ll be close to 40, I didn’t think it seemed impossible. 

And I agree, they sold convinced themselves Eberle was on a decline and sold low in a bad year.

8094 2018-03-07 05:58:25 I don’t think Strome ever saw much time with Tavares, other than PP? 

Regardless, I’m happy with Strome. I’d love it if he carved himself into a useful checker like Backlund. He’s got the speed and stamina, and since they moved him onto the PK, results have been much better.
8095 2018-03-07 05:58:15 Agree with Al, 35-40 point range made the most sense with a chance to push for 45ish if everything went swimmingly well. With that said, he is not Eberle, as that young man is an actual goal-scorer.

8104 2018-03-07 05:55:52 Fair enough. And I agree, he looks a lot better at centre. Although I’d argue Strome is much more skilled than Maroon. 

It’s upsetting cuz I know Strome at 3c means baby nuge is gone, and I that kills me. He’s my fave Oiler.
8105 2018-03-07 05:55:51 Wow, Trader Joe’s rose oil is making my skin thrive
8106 2018-03-07 05:55:44 There is nothing to suggest he'd produce similar results, as he's never done it in the past. Also, let's forget Strome saw time w/ a pretty damn good player in Tavares in Long Island and it made little difference to his point totals.

8120 2018-03-07 05:53:35 Are we talking Strome? If so, to be quite honest, he's looked lost all season playing on the wing so it's tough to say. With that said, as good a season as Maroon had w/ McDavid in '16-'17 he finished up w/ 42 points.

8204 2018-03-07 05:41:14 You can make a collective argument, sure. You can't say what, exactly, influenced any one protester no more than you can say what one barrel of oil did to make today warm.
8205 2018-03-07 05:41:09 Dead skin cells of the body can be removed by applying mixture of olive oil and salt. Replacing salt with granulated sugar can work too.

8217 2018-03-07 05:37:55 Here’s a serious question. 

If he had played the whole season on the 1st PP and in the top six, where do we think he would be?

I thought he’d be closer to 50-55 points if he had spent 70% of his time playing with 97 like @Lowetide forecasted at the start of the year

8220 2018-03-07 05:36:12 What’s crazier is that with all of things going on in the world, there are still a bunch of zombies tweeting in anger over a reality show. The world is on fire right now, but knowing what Kim Kardashian did for lunch is more important. This is why the human race is failing.

8237 2018-03-07 05:32:58 To my knowledge Trump didn’t kill thousands of innocent people to justify an invasion of middle eastern countries just to bleed them for oil and establish western influenced governments.

So, u win!

8252 2018-03-07 05:31:27 No it's more sinister: fossil fuel production is declining 6% annually and fuelling higher energy production costs. By 2050 oil will be a state-only resource and exhausted by 2080. 30+ years away. No oil: no trade; no jobs; no food; no clothing; no transport... mass depopulation

8262 2018-03-07 05:29:52 bill nye and other Americans seem fine to dictate to Canada what we should do.  Also The oil production ramped up under Obama. They doubled their production from 2008 to 2015.   Yes trump is going to take it higher but Both sides in US seems to understand economics.
8263 2018-03-07 05:29:39 @HYDTP Pl relocate bus stop near RK PUram bridge on tirumalgiri rd & block right turn just after getting down RKPURAM bridge to avoid frequent jams during peak hrs. Also restrict movement of heavy vehicles (garbage, oil, cylinder) autos on dt road during office hrs

8270 2018-03-07 05:28:26 @NancyCNBC So basically if your technical expert thinks that CAD goes up in short term i think Oil price goes up too ! i am not technical expert so thanks for that!
8271 2018-03-07 05:28:14 Yeah olive oil takes a long time to heat up and get to a good heat for crisping/frying

(I think it's closer to 20 but ok, she was shocked) She asked me what I've done - I'm like - it's mostly the cbd oil I'm taking each morning - but that stuff is worthless amirite?

8277 2018-03-07 05:27:13 Hmmm maybe. I always use cheap vegetable oil so that might make difference?
8278 2018-03-07 05:26:45 Done. This was mine:
We the people of California refuse off shore drilling as we are an area that relies on tourism, has sensitive ecological features, is earthquake prone and well remembers the oil coating the coast of Southern California
There have been five major oil related
8279 2018-03-07 05:26:35 I let them sit for a bit and then also got the pan pretty hot before I threw them in but I'm thinking I went wrong w/ using olive oil
8280 2018-03-07 05:26:35 Let's talk oils. If you're allergic to coconut oil, like a lot of our family is,  babassu oil is a good substitute. It is a 1-2 on the comodogenic scale (little pore clogging).Its nice to use on natural hair
8281 2018-03-07 05:26:24 I don’t think that’s water. I think it’s butter but it looks so white it may be coconut oil which makes this whole travesty much worse...
8282 2018-03-07 05:26:23 Cue the new overtures to Africa's  "shithole nations". More oil adventures for Rexy and and his Exxon pals.

8291 2018-03-07 05:25:03 Oil sales declined by 18 percent annually to 1.5 million tons in February mainly on the back of sharp drop in FO sales which declined by 26 percent to 4.7m tons amid lower demand from power sector
8292 2018-03-07 05:24:51 Thanks @beaud113 ! This is a threath to the Canadian democracy. Befor the build of a large CO2 cleaning plant, new oil fields, or power gates we had debates in media with pros and cons. In Quebec the 30 persons in a meeting against local production gets all the media attention.
8293 2018-03-07 05:24:47 Just ran out of coconut oil I didn't notice earlier. On top of that I'm broke.

8300 2018-03-07 05:23:29 I agree with you and believe it is spreading already. My fear and worry is that nothing urgent is being done, though I know that citizens are flagging it daily. Root cause must be determined. Some say it's from illegal oil refining or from gas flaring. It's an emergency. #phsoot
8301 2018-03-07 05:23:25 When Trump now speaks I think most sane people are seeing the curtain pulled back revealing a sleazy snake oil salesman; a con man who has spent his entire life (at any expense) to build up a facade of his importance, wealth, prestige, intelligence, etc. #ItsAlmostOver @donlemon

8308 2018-03-07 05:22:43 It's best to smell it.If it smells rancid, then yes. If not, start refrigeration now. It will smell like old oil, not the fishy smell it has.
8309 2018-03-07 05:22:42 Peppermint oil helps with my allergies and my never ending sinus drainage  makes it easier to breathe.
8310 2018-03-07 05:22:39 It’s not just the US blockading CDN oil. Saudi Arabia is making $Billions selling oil to Quebec and points east. They also fund Liberal election campaigns.
8311 2018-03-07 05:22:38 Maybe we should just buy more oil out of the country so we can pay $7 for a gallon of gas? Makes sense to me.
8312 2018-03-07 05:22:37 Showed my roommate the joy of new flavour bursts by roasting veggies with olive oil, fresh herbs from our window planters and a drizzle of balsamic vinegar.

We have a expansive  network of infracsture thru out the gulf 4 oil & gas & the gulf ranks as the nations top energy asset.

8349 2018-03-07 05:16:50 What lies! CA banning drilling is just giving oil exploration 2 other countries & requiring strip mining for lithium 4 batteries as long as it puts America in debt to other nations

8354 2018-03-07 05:15:38 Trump described in a nutshell:

Wish for oil drilling off the coasts, pretending there is no such thing as global warming to Elephant hunting;  

Isolationism leading to economic destruction;  

Termination of Civil Rights and liberties;  

Corruption;

Racism and bigotry...

Nubian Life Nourishing Hair and Body Oil is excellent for both hair and skin. It greatly accomplishes the tasks to sooth, condition and hydrate skin. On the skin use whenever desired to maintain moisture and balance. The oil is great when massaged
8360 2018-03-07 05:14:45 yes that also. I suppose one could pour it back into a bottle. but then how many times can one re-use deep fry oil? Man, the conundrums.

8373 2018-03-07 05:12:57 And that’s only the beginning. Now I’m pondering how to store or reuse this precious oil because I have no heart to throw it away.
8374 2018-03-07 05:12:41 HAHAHA. No puppy, he has until June. I have my lovely aloe plant to soothe me as well as a jar of coconut oil. 10/10 not a great experience.
8375 2018-03-07 05:12:26 ^Dont use coconut oil on your skin unless you have dry , flakey skin, aloe vera gel, witch hazel as a toner and the ginzing energy boosting gel moisturizer by origins cleared up my skin in a few days (on the priceyr side but totally worth it), also use a toner w/ olive oil in it
8376 2018-03-07 05:12:19 Yup only I can further block the movement of oil! Vote, vote often and vote Clown party.
8377 2018-03-07 05:12:15 And dear old @IvankaTrump has been going around the country selling it like cheap snake oil.
8378 2018-03-07 05:12:12 The theys of the globalist world can't wait to get us into a war & will lie & deceive long enough to make it believable cause.

8379 2018-03-07 05:12:10 Data is the new oil given the value of ML. Cross selling can lower both CAC and churn. Best value accrues if your service is complementary. Selling hemeroid cream at the petting zoo is not an optimal cross sale since it is not a complementary product for example.

8411 2018-03-07 05:07:49 I find no reason for any jt explo for crude or gas at WPS as the era of oil is waning. It’s the era of elect cars. If it’s gas, better throw the money at Benham where we got no conflict w/ nobody. We contract the Japs who seemed to have the tech for methane conversion to LNG.
8412 2018-03-07 05:07:29 I hate when I put my coconut oil on & then I gotta pee. Then my ass be sliding all around the toilet seat 
8413 2018-03-07 05:07:25 Oil drilled in the US may or may not be more expensive that imported but does anyone dispute the idea that buying our most important products from foreign countries is not a good philosophy. Let’s make and sell steel again right here in America

8442 2018-03-07 05:02:38 Then I add oil to the wok again, get it nice and hot, and then all the veggies go in. Once they're mostly cooked I throw in the chicken, add more stir-fry sauce and let it fry for a couple minutes. After that it's ready to go and can be served on rice

8451 2018-03-07 05:01:18 Canada will put a tarrif on Canadian tourists going to Florida. What if Canada bottoms out the Canadian dollar. Canada can do that because we are truly self sufficient. Not like the us's insatiable appitite for oil. Canada will win a trade war and we are ready to fight.

8458 2018-03-07 05:00:34 Brian, I don't know how strong the CBD oil is that you are taking, but feel if you would smoke also, you would get your appetite back.

Canada receives only $3 royalty per barrel while mega corps own OUR OIL.
8466 2018-03-07 04:59:58 i’m going back to coating my face in vitamin e oil before bed every night bc that shit did wonders idky i ever stopped

8468 2018-03-07 04:59:44 That ocean front property isn't worth anywhere near what Canada's potential oil export market is worth.

Spills are over-hyped.  Crude oil isn't kryptonite.  It's just oil.  All-natural, and even organic.

Thanks!
8474 2018-03-07 04:58:15 Whenever I listen to Patrick Bitature speaking, I feel like a car being serviced, with old oil being cleaned out and new oil being poured in.

8475 2018-03-07 04:58:12 Pulang istirahat, makan yang banyak.. Aku kemarin flu minum imboost sama pake essential oil sih.. Bentar udah sembuh..
8476 2018-03-07 04:57:52 Thankful for CBD oil
8477 2018-03-07 04:57:43 Mock if you like. But I would recommend that energy economists track the GWh volumes of advanced batteries. Every kWh will create value by displacing fuels be it oil, coal or natural gas. It's just a question of where they will create the most value.
8478 2018-03-07 04:57:40 Please do not drain poor people central government.... Increase in oil, gas and all other prices is only thing done by Modi ji government

8482 2018-03-07 04:57:20 I now dry brush before I shower, use a spin brush thingy to cleanse my face, and do dead sea masks and body scrubs. I have an essential oil diffuser, and my body wash is mostly made of tea tree oil.

I'm about be the smoothest, best smelling, calmest bitch in Indiana.

8490 2018-03-07 04:56:13 Lol!  That’s for sure though.  This country is so resource rich.  Oil shortage, global warming, all that stuff is crap, and is just a scam for ppl like Al Gore & CF to get even richer.  Jalan just admitted to selling crap steel for the last 50 years! We need to make our own sh*t.

8494 2018-03-07 04:55:15 Ahhhh! “Oil filthy dirty pipeline Bush” Love it! Hit the nail on the head! Yeah, I’m pushing my SOS for #PaperBallots. I mean, if they’re good for Germany, France, Canada, ya know, democracies, why can’t we go back to that? They’re unhackable after all. But we know why, dirty GOP
8495 2018-03-07 04:55:03 I don't understand.....Cz there's nothing investigative here. They should've listed major's companies and not mention church or oil or 25k fake news gala dinner. Maybe I dont get it.

8498 2018-03-07 04:54:34 So I took time thinking about how folks intend actualizing their dream of a NewNigeria. Theoretically, this dream could be achieved in no less than a thousand means. But in practice, for its actualization, folks would need to pray to a God they believe in, so that oil dries up.

8510 2018-03-07 04:52:28 Oops, sorry.  They're not a net exporter currently.  But they now produce as much (or slightly less) crude oil than Saudi Arabia.  They are on track to net exports in less than 10 years, I think.
8511 2018-03-07 04:52:15 My arse. Can't afford to pay rent, pay bills and put food on the table. Luckily I've cut out going to doctors, dentists let alone get fuel at exorbitant costs when oil per barrel at all time lows, now pay reg on 6 monthly bases due to can't keep up with living costs in Victoria
8512 2018-03-07 04:51:56 you can also take some of the oils from your nose and eyelids if you really need something. a drop of some kind of cooking oil will also do.

8514 2018-03-07 04:51:41 You are ignorant of the fact that the man who controls the Crime Minister wants Canadian oil shut down and that makes your opinion completely worthless. Low info voters like you should embarrassed by the government you helped elect buy you aren't because zero comprehension.

8521 2018-03-07 04:50:37 What would you pay for a custom 16x20 oil painting? Keeping in mind that materials cost a lot (paint tube with only one color can cost almost 40$), and painting session added up in totally adds up to about 24hours of work
8522 2018-03-07 04:50:28 Anyone smell another oil grab in the works?
8523 2018-03-07 04:50:27 Now that I've got the straight non-toasted sesame oil I'll see if a couple of drops of that improves matters...
8524 2018-03-07 04:50:27 What is Canada doing wrong? With 1/2 the oil production of Canada ,Norway has a surplus of a $1 trillion while Canada has a deficit of $1.3 trillion.Norway owns it's oil 
Canada receives only $3 royalty per barrel while mega corps own OUR OIL.
8525 2018-03-07 04:50:26 Oh wait, just realized this didn’t pertain to Oil & Gas Law. Carry on.
8526 2018-03-07 04:50:26 I mean even though you told me to shutup, I had to stop using it. Face kept randomly breaking out then my allergist said its made out of tree nut oil, which I’m allergic to most tree nuts so what a L! Lol
8527 2018-03-07 04:50:26 Fuel marking should have been done years ago if not for the politically-protected big oil smugglers who opposed it. @DOF_PH @doe_ph
8528 2018-03-07 04:50:12 Is odor just on fur or inthe skin? If skin, the carrier oil might also be soothing. Certain ess oils - eucalyptus, tea tree - always linked to housecleaning but I suspect their medicinal scent might cz reaction. Orange oil also good for cleaning + smells nicer.
8529 2018-03-07 04:50:01 all I used it pepper, olive oil and parsley.  bake at 425 for about 30 minutes

once everything is seasoned just mix it all together and put it on a baking sheet/pan

you can add salt but I didn’t, I’m trying to stay away from salt :-)

8537 2018-03-07 04:48:15 Houston ain't Texas. It's a caricature of Texas. It is unlike any other city in Texas. It is ALL about oil in Houston.Dallas, Austin, El Paso. Cruz is not popular there. I travel the state, live in Plano. Every town has a different flavor. I personally would never generalize.

8558 2018-03-07 04:45:46 Seriously, where have you been? Cracking the earths crust then inject toxic slippery fluids that extract gas and oil leaving voids ends only one way. A crack never stops until it ends at the wall of an aquifer, the earths crust is not static, smaller plate cracked move frequently
8559 2018-03-07 04:45:42 Just yelled “you’ve messed with the wrong bitch” to the mice while vindictively spraying peppermint oil all over the apartment. Let’s see how they like THAT!

8588 2018-03-07 04:42:19 The problem with Venezuela (per Mark Blyth) is that they went all in on oil and didn't use the short term revenue to diversify the economy, and the old, more charismatic leader died and was replaced with an incompetent, less-liked one. It's not "socialism" or "despotism".

8613 2018-03-07 04:39:28 Intensification is going the wrong way. We should be talking about reducing consumption & extraction. Oil isn’t going away but it should be respected as the precious resource it is, so let’s stop squandering it and use less where ever we can. Future generations are counting on it

8625 2018-03-07 04:38:14 Excuse me sir.   I think you meant to say 13 million slaves were exported by Africans.    I believe history reveals this was the largest source of wealth for the African nation at that time.     Certainly before oil and blood diamonds were traded.

8703 2018-03-07 04:27:37 Aye, that's the rub. As soon as a person or two gets to decide what someone else 'needs', they'll decide they and their friends 'need' a little more.  Bingo!  Corruption!  Not long (when the oil money runs out), you get Venezuela.
8704 2018-03-07 04:27:08 We always put the cheese directly on a hot pan and fry. No oil. The cheese makes its own oil. And don’t be afraid to let them burn a little or they won’t hold their shape.

8708 2018-03-07 04:26:33 Anyway, we can get better prices for our oil on the WORLD market -- not the US market.  And it doesn't involve building any refineries which we don't need.
8709 2018-03-07 04:26:21 Retired people look for income especially in a prevailing low interest rate environment. 70% of the economy is driven by consumer spending. If Flaherty was worried about tax, he shouldn't have given 8 billion dollars in breaks to the banks and oil companies

8757 2018-03-07 04:19:11 Do me a favor and go find some place that serves olive oil roasted beets with a sprinkle of sea salt. I promise you will love them.

8762 2018-03-07 04:18:55 Who got the oil?
8763 2018-03-07 04:18:53 coconut oil is still the holy grail
8764 2018-03-07 04:18:32 But perhaps women don’t make as much as men for other reasons?

A teacher isn’t not going to make as much as an oil rig guy, for example. A female laweyer will make more than a male cashier.
8765 2018-03-07 04:18:31 I ordered everything except the oil I think lol.
8766 2018-03-07 04:18:28 Unhygienic, kasi un pubic area has apocrine glands  and sebaceous glands which is basically what we also have in our armpits, so once mag secrete ng odorless substrance un apocrine mix with the bacteria from the oil from sebacious glands thats where odor starts.
8767 2018-03-07 04:18:24 okay i made an appointment to get my oil changed at 07:00 BECAUSE ???
8768 2018-03-07 04:18:16 Tides primarily wants to stop Canadian oil from entering the world market so they will fund any group apposed to it. That is why protesters seem to not need money.
8769 2018-03-07 04:18:04 Lorenzo’s Oil has one of my favorite MPAA ratings: “PG-13 for a child's life threatening ordeal”
8770 2018-03-07 04:18:03 So what?  They have been there for over 100 years.   They operate facilities or market products all over the world and explore for oil and natural gas on six continents.
8771 2018-03-07 04:17:51 Grabe nakakaiyak. May naglalako dito ng massage oil na babae tas dala nya yung anak nya tapos sunod sunod nya lahat ng gusto ng anak nya na kainin. Huhu. Chichirya, noodles, etc. alam naman na konti lang ang kinikita sa mga ganyan.  Bitchesa pa yung bata. Leche.

8780 2018-03-07 04:16:55 Great! We're living in the stone age of drilling for oil. Sweden, Germany, China and so many other countries are crushing us innovating in clean energy. We've learned nothing from deep water horizon. Who wants Quaker state with their fish.
8781 2018-03-07 04:16:54 It depends on what car you have, i had to google how to reset the oil light on my type of car to avoid reading the manual
8782 2018-03-07 04:16:33 My data is from the Congressional Budget office... his G20 article was done by the Oil Change International, Friends of the Earth which is a paid wind/solar advocacy group... no conflict of interest there
8783 2018-03-07 04:16:30 Please leave that stuff alone. Get regular old MCT oil.
8784 2018-03-07 04:16:29 This literally has been happening to me too! :c I’ve been using sea berry seed oil, it’s kind of pricy, but it’s been really helping my skin!
8785 2018-03-07 04:16:27 “Our largest partner proving unstable” means little when Trudeau’s lack of leadership on energy leads to billions in withdrawn int’l investment and billions more lost to the US due to discounted Cdn oil. Trudeau is not worthless in power. He’s actively destructive.
8786 2018-03-07 04:16:12 These guys really want that Russian oil to flow unimpeded. Everyones getting a piece; UAE, Trump, Putin on down the line.

8792 2018-03-07 04:15:54 That's an opinion of a site I stopped reading some time ago. It's all just various brokerages, "advisors" and shills pumping various investments.

They are "activists", too. Keeping a supply of discounted Canadian oil exclusively shipping to the US is in their interest.

8800 2018-03-07 04:14:21 I feel that... well just do like me and wake up in a fit of rage cursing your hair and reaching for the clippers while coincidentally your coconut oil just ran out.
8801 2018-03-07 04:14:10 I diffuse Lavender oil and put a drop of cedar wood oil on my big toes and a drop on my pillow.  I sleep very well.  I have tons of stress and some PTSD.  Trust me, this is the only thing I have found that works
8802 2018-03-07 04:13:58 I think this is a good time for CANADA to start including tariffs on our oil, water, timber.  But we will pay you to keep Justin Bieber.  If you take our cheesy trust fund Prime Minister @JustinTrudeau  we will pay you the billions that we save.  #HeSucks

8809 2018-03-07 04:13:17 Exactly why we need strong representation in our oil producing provinces. This awful Federal Government looks to kill our industry. Provincial NDP wants to do the same. Thank you for your service. Get your things done then hopeful you help us again.

8812 2018-03-07 04:12:54 They’re definitely doing much better than the Oil are this year! Playoff scene down there looks like fun from what we saw last year.
8813 2018-03-07 04:12:54 Chopped up all of my veggies, tossed them in olive oil with garlic, oregano, and salt & pepper. Got them marinating overnight. 
8814 2018-03-07 04:12:44 FR!!! I stopped using that and I’ve just been using warm water first, then tea tree oil with lavender (sometimes Neosporin) and it’s been helping with redness and inflammation but the stupid bump is still there after two months 
8815 2018-03-07 04:12:23 If you put that aside, you’re not talking medicine or science anymore. Just charlatanry and snake oil. Dr Drew? Really? You wanna go there?

Meanwhile, China stands to become biggest innovator & producer of forward-thinking clean energy.

In the 21st c., being the largest oil producer is NOT a matter for pride ...

8843 2018-03-07 04:10:04 For a cooking tip:

Whenever you’re boiling water put vegetable oil in it and the water won’t boil over the pot.
8844 2018-03-07 04:10:04 maybe. But we're even quiet just for oil changes and basic stuff.
8845 2018-03-07 04:10:03 I'm almost out of coconut oil. THIS IS NOT A DRILL!!!!

8850 2018-03-07 04:09:47 I dont know why i made an oil change appointment at 9 am in willard on my day off. Wtf was i thinking....
8851 2018-03-07 04:09:43 Having to use chapstick is so weird. Like we have to spread oil and wax on a specific part of our face because it’s a different type of skin and can’t regulate its moisture levels?

8857 2018-03-07 04:09:08 I understand how we can't totally be rid of oil and gas, but why not diversify and use all of the energy sources that are available so we don't need to rely so heavily on non renewables?  Or do we need to suck every drop out of the Earth?
8858 2018-03-07 04:09:05 バッグの購入基準や扱いがそのままほぼ恋人の趣味だという話。私は「利便性。大容量。丈夫なこと。雑に扱っても壊れない。壊れたらつくろってどうしようもなくなるまで使いきる」でどういう顔をしていいのか分からなかったけど、母の「バッグはできれば持ちたくない！存在を消したい！」が優勝だと思う

8861 2018-03-07 04:08:53 I would bet the sahara desert and antarctica have absolutely massive amounts of oil to be exploited
8862 2018-03-07 04:08:53 After changing head gaskets, fixing vacuum leaks, replacing my thermostat, and fooling with starters. I broke and took my car to the shop for an oil change. My hands have never been so sore. Lol
8863 2018-03-07 04:08:47 Any mega merger requires govt approval to prevent private sector monopolies. Monopoly prevention goes back all the way to Standard Oil
8864 2018-03-07 04:08:36 Funny Trump selected Tillerson for the position of SEC of State. Wonder why Putin wanted him. A comrade who would support Russia and get at all those oil reserves just waiting to be drilled. Rubles for everyone.
8865 2018-03-07 04:08:32 Garlic is definitely a pizza topping on tomato based pizzas. But if you order a garlic pizza, it’s olive oil, garlic and oregano. Just on a pizza base.
8866 2018-03-07 04:08:14 @Dominos_UK Interesting service from one of your UK stores last night. Server and pizza maker was dusting the shop and eating pizza while making my pizza, dough balls had a strong burning smell of I presume excessive oil and was disgusting, then had an upset stomach

8868 2018-03-07 04:07:52 This video sucks. Promoting cooking in liquid oils is what is leading to epidemic of violence and disease. Food cooked in olive oil (+ all liquid oils) mutates DNA. Its killing the world via outwordly projected violence from within. #maga stop promoting poisonous foods!

8879 2018-03-07 04:06:12 True electric cars aren't, hybrids are. We have the technology but big oil still is in control, it's time we embrace the future and enjoy the renewables, global warming or not i do enjoy clean air and blue skies.

8888 2018-03-07 04:05:21 I'm conflicted because not a single animator worked in this movie. Even rotoscope requires animators, but they went directly to just painting every frame by oil painters casted for this movie because they didn't want the animation style of animators to get in the way.

8902 2018-03-07 04:03:30 The CIA never let go of their lies. Russians are no worse than we in the West. They are drilling for oil in the arctic & they are somewhat homophobic, but many people here are like that too. We must realise that Russia has been preventing U.S. expansion in the M.E. US hates that!
8903 2018-03-07 04:03:21 I have a theory! The natural oils highlighted my neck and the sun burned my neck as a result of the natural oil.

8906 2018-03-07 04:03:11 Should also be noted that in 2016 Scott was brought in by the 4 Oil executives that purchased the Bears Den in 2013 as an Operational Manager for partnership.  He was not the sole owner but what a spin.

8912 2018-03-07 04:01:24 The failure was a lack of diversification in the face of plunging oil prices. Not the social programs themselves. You can’t have an economy that only relies on one thing, the US economy doesn’t do that. We aren’t going to go bankrupt by implementing universal health care.

8926 2018-03-07 03:59:35 Other times socialist policies aren’t even really the problem. Venezuela didn’t talk apart because of socialism, it fell apart because it had a command & control economy centered on oil. The state mostly relied on oil profits to fund its generous social programs.

9036 2018-03-07 03:45:31 Did you find oil?
9037 2018-03-07 03:45:14 Especially when you have such terrible Bone Spurs. His courage is legendary!! What a brave sociopath your snake oil salesman is!! The billionaire fighting for the middle class. How did you all buy such absurd nonsense??
9038 2018-03-07 03:45:11 Ideals our politicians follow are petty parody of greed for money & power. Nothing much, nothing less. Evident they are feeding on ignorance of uneducated & poor. Snake oil sellers don't last, but we've got lots. Nepal needs #education to rid of this pests & #soonWewill together
9039 2018-03-07 03:45:09 Like oil in water.
9040 2018-03-07 03:44:58 tea tree oil!
9041 2018-03-07 03:44:48 I pakai simple oil cleanser. If you ada acne prone skin avoid mineral oil. biore oil cleanser 1st ingredients mineral oil.
9042 2018-03-07 03:44:14 "Garlic, pepper, onion, bay leaf, cumin, oregano, potatoe, carrots salt pepper and olive oil"
I texted my dad. it is for sure 100% tasty and he grew up in cuba but he is a wizard and i can't make anything as tasty as he does

9046 2018-03-07 03:43:32 Revelation 6:6 And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine.
9047 2018-03-07 03:43:20 Hahahaha @AcharyaPramodk  Kab be oil tera khatam kya
9048 2018-03-07 03:43:03 Renewable energy is oil dependent 
9049 2018-03-07 03:42:54 I did, however, enjoy the ability constantly resort to the technique of "soak everything in oil, set it on fire, back up, lather, rinse, repeat"
9050 2018-03-07 03:42:41 Is it bad that I love the look of the oil slick? Not just here, if you ignore the fact it's greasy pollutant, it's quite pretty
9051 2018-03-07 03:42:38 もちろん生！冷蔵庫焼けして乾いた葉っぱんとこでムセたりするけど、やめられない( ´∀｀ )
9052 2018-03-07 03:42:37 Because the price of oil has increased. 60% of gas prices is based off of crude prices. Also transportation costs have increased due to more government regulations.
9053 2018-03-07 03:42:35 Johnson is such a manipulator. He couldnt help himself and had to claim that EU countries are beholden to Russia because of oil, while making no mention of the UKs tolerance, even active attempts to attract Russian money to London. #ToryLies #BrexitLies
9054 2018-03-07 03:42:32 Want a full body massage with some warm oil
9055 2018-03-07 03:42:29 @BillNye I grew up in Fort McMurray. It sustained my family for 40 years, and still. You have no right to demean ethical oil. What you suggest, or “believe”, ruins so much more than you could fathom. And, to sit with #PmZoolander @JustinTrudeau ? Brought you down a lot of pegs.
9056 2018-03-07 03:42:20 You have failed to address what I wrote in my post. Perhaps you didn't read it carefully? Perhaps you didn't understand its meaning? Perhaps you should read it again and consider the consequences of countries being able to sell oil for RMB and then exchange that RMB for gold.

9058 2018-03-07 03:42:13 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Oakland sleeps.
9059 2018-03-07 03:42:13 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Dallas sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

9061 2018-03-07 03:42:07 I you are new I will assume you are not a high level competitor. If you are shooting lead bullets - every time. If not, perhaps just enough to brush the bore with solvent, a few patches (1 w/oil) and enough cleaning of the slide/guts to ensure no buildup
9062 2018-03-07 03:42:06 Wild fires should be named after oil companies.

9065 2018-03-07 03:41:28 We still invest tons into green energy, which btw is oil dependent.
9066 2018-03-07 03:41:21 “You know get your tires rotated, oil changed. Oh, and your car services too!”  @Annie_bug03
9067 2018-03-07 03:41:09 I just made these fat bombs... equal parts coconut oil, unswt shredded coconut, cocoa powder and any nut butter... so amazing....like a rich reese cup!
9068 2018-03-07 03:40:55 Sharia Law and Women's rights mix about as good as oil & water does. One TOTALLY contradicts the other, yet she was allowed to ride the coattails of this leftist movement in order to appear as an oppressed minority, when in fact... she cares nothing about women's rights.
9069 2018-03-07 03:40:46 My green has been turned into an oil. :D
9070 2018-03-07 03:40:45 Why does this guy think she's MadMax? CrayCray. IMonPeach! Socialize oil companies. Reclaiming my time! Riot is the voice of the unheard!

9077 2018-03-07 03:39:43 I just need oil.
9078 2018-03-07 03:39:42 Oh goody,  I can’t
t wait for for polluted rivers, choking on smog, eating contaminated food, looking out a vista of oil rigs, watching water foul struggle in oil scum, bed bugs are not a problem.
9079 2018-03-07 03:39:41 Sounds like a plan! Might make you famous  you’ll find out why they call me “coconut oil shawty”
9080 2018-03-07 03:39:33 I realize I'm wasting my time, but GW can pound Saudi sand/oil along with his "new world order" daddy 'cause neither said dick while Obama drove this country further into ditch then the RINOS did! Thank God we didn't end up with @JebBush & "love" ideas of Bush clan!
9081 2018-03-07 03:39:24 Thai Oil Public Company Limited (TOP) Declined -1.28% on Mar...
9082 2018-03-07 03:39:21 Also...this “greatest reality show” is allowing poor children, disabled, seniors and likely the rest of us to die too young and in pain. Overseas, thousands if not millions will be impacted by lack of aid, oil wars, support for dictators. Oh, and nuclear war.
9083 2018-03-07 03:39:19 Except Canada only contributes 1.6% to worldwide emissions, so it really won’t change anything if the oil is left in the ground
9084 2018-03-07 03:39:19 Also might be interested to know that @speedball_art makes oil based fabric block ink so you could use this to make shirts / totes. Which is very rad. It is what I want to try next.

9087 2018-03-07 03:38:57 I snuck some Sciuridae oil into Jimmy's coffee.

9090 2018-03-07 03:38:15 Sorry bro Patrick O’Sullivan has declared War on Oil Country. Still bitter about shit that’s 8 years old. He brought all this on himself. Ask virtually anyone. He’s been trashing the city and the team for years and now he blocks anyone even associated as a oilers fan.
9091 2018-03-07 03:37:45 Won’t make any difference what we can produce if we can’t get it there. Pipelines for oil, trains for grain. We need movement
9092 2018-03-07 03:37:40 West Tx has always looked like it looks now. Outdated? The world is oil dependent and will continue to be far beyond our lifetimes. #hypocrite
9093 2018-03-07 03:37:36 You have it all wrong. Keep selling the snake oil. Just because you refuse to acknowledge the truth about Russia interference. You shouldn't mislead the public.
9094 2018-03-07 03:37:33 Oklahoma, home of the worst paid teachers in the nation, needs to be next.  All of that oil and gas money, and some school districts have instituted 4-day weeks because of lack of funding. #RiseUp

- hunt elephants and hang body parts on our wall
- dump mining chemicals into creeks & rivers
- mentally ill can buy more guns
- poison more kids with Chlorpyrifos pesticide
9097 2018-03-07 03:36:48 Dont wash you face. Just use alcohol free wipes or coconut oil and a hot towel to take off dirt and make up.  then moisturize before bed.

9124 2018-03-07 03:33:08 What you fail to recognize is that clean energy is also oil dependent. Oil won’t die any time soon.
9125 2018-03-07 03:33:07 bitch tryna talk to me but this oil got me in tweak mode
9126 2018-03-07 03:33:03 That's the best. Or when one starts selling a soy based alternative snake oil supplement to the people who call everyone soy boys, so he cant have the other one on his show anymore because, you know, bad for business.
9127 2018-03-07 03:32:31 First BOOM was the headline on Drudge that US will become largest oil producer. Actually said “BOOM” and then DJT tweeted out the screen shot. IMO of course.

9130 2018-03-07 03:32:23 Now when Jesus was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, a woman came up to him with an alabaster jar of costly perfumed oil, and poured it on his head while he was reclining at table. When the disciples saw this, they were indignant and said, “Why this waste?
9131 2018-03-07 03:32:20 some run away for greener pastures DA in boulder Colorado quit because a law firm that is employed by big oil and gas offered it

My parents were able to buy me maybe 5 Genesis games in total when I was little when Dad worked the oil field and maybe 3 N64 games the whole time I owned it. I was gifted Majora's Mask from my Aunt the year it came out and saved for 6 months for a used OoT.

9148 2018-03-07 03:30:21 OIL DIFF: 3.27 -> 3.3
9149 2018-03-07 03:30:08 You were simply bamboozled by the greatest snake oil salesmen in centuries. Made you feel warm and fuzzy and did nothing. Just another example of why we are where we are. People would rather hear soft satisfying words than see any actions.
9150 2018-03-07 03:30:02 That's cause the funding for the the anti oil groups is only to bash Canada while the us just keeps drilling with no backlash.
9151 2018-03-07 03:29:58 We do invest trillions in clean energy, which by the way depends very much on oil.
9152 2018-03-07 03:29:41 He's really just there to lift the sanctions and get the $500B oil deal with Exxon/Russia back on the table. Being ineffective is the name of the game when you are trying to weaken/paralyze the government. Why are you there, @RepNewhouse? Act or resign! #impeachtrump
9153 2018-03-07 03:29:15 So happy you're out there  I'm waiting..rust here! Need an oil can  16 would be heaven & you're getting better Yay! You're never far from our thoughts! 
9154 2018-03-07 03:29:12 I don’t have my oil change either so I’m definitely not trying to be driving until I get one tommorow too

9160 2018-03-07 03:28:35 DAPL spill detection capability = 1% of daily flow, checked every 10 days = 2.4 mil gal oil spilled = ~10 ppm benzene in Lake Oahe. Benzene's median lethal dose for aquatic organisms (from @EPA) = 7.6 ppm.

9161 2018-03-07 03:28:33 Nope, they were called a "coal oil lantern" as late as 1955.
9162 2018-03-07 03:28:25 Politics aside I honestly kind of love Garrison. He takes the implicit absurdity of political cartoons and magnifies it by 1 million. Also, outside of him wanting to give Trump an oil massage or whatever, I actually think he's got better artistic chops than most of his ilk.
9163 2018-03-07 03:28:14 If you pour oil on water, is the water wet then?

9169 2018-03-07 03:27:25 Seen @AbdulElSayed speak at a town hall earlier tonight and I am all in. We deserve 15$ minimum wage, single payer hc, legal marijuana/ criminal justice reform, transition to 100% renewable energy and putting and end to fracking and oil pipelines.
9170 2018-03-07 03:27:20 This should have and possibly would have happened had big oil & coal not stymied growth of alternative/renewable energy.

9185 2018-03-07 03:25:18 Putin wants those sanctions dropped, he wants that Ukraine oil tax free, he wants the U.S.S.R back, but make no mistake, he wants American humiliation in the worst way. That Cold War hatred never went anywhere,in my view. Putin embodies it.He wants to decimate us. He wants it all

9196 2018-03-07 03:23:32 It’s a “no” if there isn’t decent olive oil on the table.
9197 2018-03-07 03:23:32 But oil does need to clean it's act up if it's to deserve the respect of future generations.
Let's act accordingly.

9232 2018-03-07 03:20:10 Coastal waters to have FAITH nothing will go wrong. This is the NOT moving into a direction that @Interior is towards keeping and preserving our National Monuments and Landscape. The "gull" to believe an Oil Rig catastrophe can't accure. @realDonaldTrump you make genius, "dim".

9239 2018-03-07 03:19:08 I don't think you understand. The Chinese are not backing the RMB with their own sovereign gold. They've simply set up this scenario: one may already exchange RMB for open-market physical gold in Hong Kong and Dubai; now they are launching an oil/RMB contract. What happens next?

9241 2018-03-07 03:18:59 Well Sarawak have gotten back their rights about their oil. When will it take for the rest of the states to get back theirs. Because if I remember correctly, most of the states that have oil in Malaysia are also the poorest states. It's time we give them back what's theirs.

9247 2018-03-07 03:18:25 The world is oil dependent. Even clean energy depends on FF

9249 2018-03-07 03:18:15 He can say "no collusion" all he wants but it's not that simple. He's a snake oil salesmen and will find any mark that suits his needs. Taking your shady business and shadier business practices into the white house will not fly
9250 2018-03-07 03:18:09 Yeah the one I do has coconut oil in it. I love the outcome. It’s just nasty to put in lol
9251 2018-03-07 03:17:59 No wonder if the next target after Syria is Iran. The real issue is the greed for superpower, oil & business around it. Middle East is the scapegoat for American dreams.
9252 2018-03-07 03:17:59 I cooked myself a few weeks ago, and plenty of just coconut cooking oil helped when aloe and moisturiser didn't. Overnight I dropped from like, 'extremely embarassed' to 'mildly sheepish'
9253 2018-03-07 03:17:58 Depending on the surplus amount it is all sold to the highest bidder on the open market just like Saudi oil. Yeah it shud stay here but the truth is it aint.

9262 2018-03-07 03:16:41 Ok brother, I hear you. And it's not like people are using oil just for the hell of it, they're using it to raise the standard of living wherever they happen to live. And it sure as shit beats using coal.

9266 2018-03-07 03:15:42 Rather than manage, preserve, and protect our public lands and natural resources Zinke’s priority is facilitating oil, gas , coal industries and other Users in the exploitation and degradation of our national treasures.  Sickening!

9277 2018-03-07 03:14:23 Run the burnt area/s under cold water to cool the skin a bit, then SLATHER it in coconut oil. Do it overnight, it'll help.
9278 2018-03-07 03:14:18 We otherwise use olive oil. I'm guessing there is plenty of flavor you can throw into sauteed sprouts though. Maybe a little lemon. I've used garlic in the past and that works out well.

Too many people simply boil them and then hate them.
9279 2018-03-07 03:13:56 are u using any cleansing tool with simple cleansing oil?
9280 2018-03-07 03:13:48 Another amazing thing about science: one can make a fortune jetting around the world, creating a carbon footprint the size of one of Suzuki’s homes, preaching climagedon and evils of oil, all with a straight face, AND be taken seriously! #cdnpoli #ifnluvscience

9293 2018-03-07 03:11:29 Actually she's doing all she can to get the pipeline going. She's putting billions into retiring the coal fired power plants to greenwash the oil industry. Billions from the C tax to innovate oil which should jolly well innovate without our $. She's basically PC. But you think no
9294 2018-03-07 03:11:25 a doer. The potential is enormous. We're not dropping them right across. Clinton is going to get the oil is all relative.
9295 2018-03-07 03:10:56 “You’re glowing.” Nah, it’s just rosehip oil.
9296 2018-03-07 03:10:55 if youre both acne prone, then mmg boleh jd... for me simple tu mcm thick jugak consistency dia... kalau oil cleanser yg best mcm jenis2 paulas choice huhuh
9297 2018-03-07 03:10:53 The cynic in me suspects the oil and gas companies know this, so they might just wait until they can force Timor's hand.

9312 2018-03-07 03:09:28 How about giving us our 2A back, I love to see our coast line filled with oil rigs, liberal anti gun jurks. Now you get the burn gun owners got.
9313 2018-03-07 03:09:26 Perhaps. 

On the other hand, if an oil/CNY contract can be seamlessly exchanged for a CNY/gold contract with guaranteed physical delivery ... well, I submit that will be very likely to send a few ripples through global currency markets, producing consequences as yet unforeseen.
9314 2018-03-07 03:09:22 My own experience with #MedicalMarijuana is short, maybe 3 years or so. I've tried several strains as well as CBD oil. For me, the CBD oil relaxed my muscles but I got much stronger effect for severe pain using the natural plant. So, both have a place in my pain "toolbox."
9315 2018-03-07 03:09:10 this Indian hemp oil smell bomb as shit in my head 
9316 2018-03-07 03:09:00 Cold water diffusers are better ( more diluted), and pets should always have access to leave a room ( they know when oil not suitable)
9317 2018-03-07 03:08:49 Besides lack of food and oil, the left are split in 2- 3 major sections and guns probably play a big role since a lot of republicans own some and little amount democrats own them.

9342 2018-03-07 03:05:54 Put some drops of italian balsamic vingegar on the oil.

9344 2018-03-07 03:05:35 The most corrupt family in US history, the Bush Family. Go ahead read about them. War made them rich, oil made them richer.
9345 2018-03-07 03:05:24 Not just the oil industry but everything. It’s simple if you charge 25%  to a company they gonna want to offset that cost by making the products more expensive. Meaning everyone pays more. USA imports a lot of steel and aluminum so there is a lot of cost we got to pay for

9354 2018-03-07 03:04:16 This is one reason I support using #MedicalMarijuana in it's natural form rather than synthetic. My layman's belief is that in natural form all cannabinoids work together for best effect. CBD oil has a great place. But so does the whole plant, imo.

9373 2018-03-07 03:01:21 The near-infinite amount of nitpickers on social media goes some way, in my mind, to proving that when society collapses, grammatical chaos will be kept at bay long after the seas eclipse the land and all the oil runs out.

9389 2018-03-07 02:59:17 With respect Mr #Trump businesses deciding to invest more in oil exploration has nothing to do with POTUS. It is entirely driven by new technologies capable of accessing more oil, higher prices for crude. Stop claiming credit for things you had nothing to do with.

9404 2018-03-07 02:57:52 You're right, in a civil war the right would still win, more people in the military are Republican than Democrat but mostly undecided, plus in places like Texas where we mainly get oil would most likely be taken over by reps and farmers and cattle ranchers are mostly on the right
9405 2018-03-07 02:57:44 3rd class sucks. I wonder what 1st class is like... The scalp massages, cooked food, the puppies, widescreen movies in color, self oil painting by an artist, bundle of cash next to the pillow mint... wonderful.

9457 2018-03-07 02:48:56 Not likely.

Majority of your choices are people highly unqualified for the job.

They either have no idea what they are doing OR they were appointed to take the department/agency apart for the profit of big corporations/oil/gas industry.
9458 2018-03-07 02:48:13 Wild 2nd in Saskatoon. The Oil Kings rally to tie the Blades at 3 with goals from Mohr (11), Souch (4) and Kemp (15). But the Blades add a pair in the final 5 minutes to lead 5-3 after 40. Shots 32-23 Saskatoon.
9459 2018-03-07 02:48:12 Do you have some sweet oil? Or Olive Oil? Warm it a little and put a few drops in your ear and put a cotton ball in your ear. Might help a little 
9460 2018-03-07 02:48:02 Yes, for many of these guys teams are toys but not making or losing money isn't an option. It's great that he says that and yet both the Sabres & Bills typically could spend more money but never do. Wonder why that is...
9461 2018-03-07 02:47:50 3/ In the meantime Timor's existing oil and gas fields are rapidly dwindling. Observers think they'll be exhausted within a decade. When that happens Timor goes off a fiscal cliff - 90% of its revenue gone

9465 2018-03-07 02:47:08 We regret to hear of your dissatisfaction, Eric. Please know this is not the ownership experience we want you to have with your Terrain. If you would like to discuss your oil consumption concerns further, please send us a DM. ^CR

9467 2018-03-07 02:46:37 For those curious about Loving County, it had a population of 113 a in 2016 (the most recent count) and had 30 oil rigs last week. That's about 1 rig for every 4 people!

9468 2018-03-07 02:46:10 I definitely need to get a oil change.

9470 2018-03-07 02:45:49 2/ Dili maintains that the oil and gas must be piped to East Timor for processing. Australia and Woodside maintain it's a pipe dream because there's a 5km deep trench in the way. Agreement could be years away. As 
@becstrating observes - this could get ugly again very quickly
9471 2018-03-07 02:45:28 Not true and just plain DISGUSTING!  No oil!!
9472 2018-03-07 02:45:27 Scott Pruitt must resign! we taxpayers want clean water a& air and if Pruitt insists on doing the bidding of the oil, gas, petrochemical industries Americans will have no choice but to force him out of office through protests @ his home and offices. Mr  Pruitt

9483 2018-03-07 02:44:07 How can any serious person think that oil will be phased out any time soon. All I hear is we’d rather pay billions to despots because we are vacuous shallow nimbyiests
9484 2018-03-07 02:43:54 That’s all due to the oil boom during the President Obama’s years. History shows that.

9487 2018-03-07 02:43:28 The US is blasting and burning its way through the Middle East, in order to gain complete control over the region's vast oil resources, as well as the securing of the major pipeline routes.
9488 2018-03-07 02:43:28 @alexkmcqueen ha! That was an ordinary one really. I could have gone with mixing 2 stroke oil/fuel for a chainsaw, percentage of an innings bowled by spinners as opposed to seamers, or maybe # string instruments / all instruments in an orchestra. :P
9489 2018-03-07 02:43:23 What you said here should be screamed from rooftops all over Canada but it’s not. But business news continues to report on America’s soaring dominance in oil & gas production as if it just a fluke!#cdnpoli

9493 2018-03-07 02:42:22 The discussion focused primarily on the renminbi but no one offered a timeline and “replacement” is probably too strong a word. Certainly China is interested in advancing its currency’s representation in its own oil market transactions with the Gulf states.
9494 2018-03-07 02:42:02 @BillNye Do us a favour, challenge the pollution problems in your own back yard and fuck off talking about Alberta oil.

9514 2018-03-07 02:39:41 Communism collapsed because the Saudi’s flooded the oil market with cheap crude. That’s why the USSR collapsed. If you look at the Russian revolution, it was funded by New York and not Moscow. It was an attack on Christianity.

9541 2018-03-07 02:34:47 According to my teachers and so called scientists at the time, by now we were going to be out of oil, there would be no food, nowhere habitable to live, and the world would be frozen. Or Reagan was going to bring on Armageddon!

9550 2018-03-07 02:33:16 Why not? There are plenty of oil rigs there already. You just don’t like energy independence or making Russia hurt more with the oil we can produce. This greatly reduces Putin’s income. Common sense doesn’t work with you I guess.

9552 2018-03-07 02:33:10 Depends on if it was neglected. They like to be driven, but like anything, they need to be maintained. 100k well-maintained is perfectly fine. 100k with three oil changes, no fluid changes, and hard driving isn't.

9585 2018-03-07 02:29:49 I'd use our resources to our best advantage.  Refineries, steel production, co-generation when it makes the most sense for energy needs, waste to energy, etc.  The oil exporting industry has lobbyists and donates to political parties.  The protesters have 350 - hardly equal.
9586 2018-03-07 02:29:47 Simple to solve, go to jobs like oil and gas, sewer stuff, jobs with brutal hours and the ones in which you could get killed. Men are still over 95% of workplace fatalities and that's why we earn (and rightfully so) more
9587 2018-03-07 02:29:46 Hi Chloe! I suffered from hormonal breakouts too. What helped was evening primrose oil, milk thistle, and DIM to get rid of excess estrogen.
9588 2018-03-07 02:29:43 I would have waited. But with the way balls are made, with no oil you almost can't keep them on the lane.

9590 2018-03-07 02:29:34 Oh! That would be because we keep sticking our nose in where it's not wanted. Invading countries for oil, raping the earth for oil, destroying communities etc. So then we pay guilt money

9598 2018-03-07 02:28:20 @AmGreenCulture Hello friend, do you have CBD oil cartridge?
9599 2018-03-07 02:28:10 The most idiotic anti BDS argument I've heard is by far, "Other countries have human rights abuses so why isn't it against that?"

It is.

What, do people think that BDS wants universities/ institutions to invest in oil companies and PMC's that *aren't* helping Israel?
9600 2018-03-07 02:28:09 Absolutely! Although I still miss mozzarella balls packed in olive oil & spices.
9601 2018-03-07 02:28:06 @naba_shsu Greet looking group.  Forensic Acctg. could help to expose the practices by oil and gas exploration companies in their efforts to avoid compensating landowners-limitless acctg. tricks.  Stealing from the poor to give to themselves and a few publicized charities.

9604 2018-03-07 02:27:47 how much did expensive olive oil cost and heck do you plan to do with it?

just curious. I've spent money on "good" olive oil and I thought it tasted like shit, even though I love olives. it's also wasted for some uses, like frying, or cooking stuff in a pan. it's too "good."

9617 2018-03-07 02:25:39 I really doubt that Mr. Trudeau is bent on strangling the oil industry. It's more likely that he and Ms. Notley are doing all they can to subsidize the industry. Why else did Trudeau give $30 million for the orphan well loan interest payment? We're paying for these subsidies.

9622 2018-03-07 02:24:46 I did that the other day with eye makeup remover and I could physically feel it go into my eye... my eyes are watering thinking about it. It’s oil too so water doesn’t welp it just gets slimy
9623 2018-03-07 02:24:42 I'd line up for that! Then,  they can work on movie theater popcorn flavor.

9629 2018-03-07 02:23:57 The oil sand should be a self cannibalizing industry: revenue from the oil sands should be reinvested into renewable energy production until green energy production completely replaced oil sand energy.

9633 2018-03-07 02:23:29 The disparity between teams will get worse. Look at European soccer in recent years. Large influx of Saudi oil money has thrown old rules out the window. Normal high dollar clubs have been dwarfed by bottomless pits

9638 2018-03-07 02:23:21 "Democracy promotion" is an Orwellian term that means doing the bidding of corporate America: Big Oil, Wall Street, and the Military Industrial Complex. An early example was the CIA Coup in Guatemala to benefit United Fruit and the Dulles law firm Sullivan & Cromwell.
9639 2018-03-07 02:23:19 Another cool thing about leather ... the pores open when warm, close when cold, just like living skin. So when you want to work the oil in, work warm (warm room or warm the oil slightly). (Same principles as spit shining using ice.)

9670 2018-03-07 02:20:21 Oil giants have been selling assets in Canada. If they are the enemy you should be a proponent of Canadian Energy.

9726 2018-03-07 02:14:04 Yes, to properly care for leather is a three-part process. First you clean it; then you let it dry 24 hours; then oil it lightly and wait 24 hours; re-oil lightly if needed (don't get too heavy w/the oil at one time); after 24 hours, add conditioner and buff. It'll look like new!

9735 2018-03-07 02:13:04 Then if it’s mostly dry, go for oil based :) but considering we live in a humid hot country, i go for water based more. Oil based is more fitting for cold climates. ^_^ and yes, soap dries the skin.. moisturizer is really a must after it hahaha

9763 2018-03-07 02:08:46 I didn't say ALL terrorist attacks, I said most of them.
Sure there are exceptions, but that doesn't change the fact that most terrorist attacks on the US are by people from countries the US has bombed to oblivion; usually for oil.
9764 2018-03-07 02:08:32 Not good jobs. Jobs where you sell your soul, jobs that make people live as addicts and dysfunctional losers. Yeah there might be exception but Alberta oil jobs destroy people and families and Alberta oil destroys the lands. Get a new and sensible plan.

And what if we are hit with 25% tariffs on our agricultural products, our steel, our oil, coal, etc.  WOW.  And these tariffs will likely impair our security arrangements.
9771 2018-03-07 02:07:45 Let’s see, we have a former brain surgeon heading HUD, an oil baron in the state dept, a billionaire as sec of ed. I don’t know; maybe hire the head greenskeeper from Mar Lago for the job. Seems qualified enough and right on track with your other cabinet members.

9791 2018-03-07 02:04:46 There are many indicators that the Canadian economy is doing fine, in fact, very well. Certainly, there are areas of concern, but most of those are beyond our control. For example, Trump, Oil Price, etc.
9792 2018-03-07 02:04:38 Brisket, Guns, Land and @tedcruz.  Oh and oil, not many things bigger in Texas

9794 2018-03-07 02:04:23 FBで @rokujyouhitoma から指摘があったけれど、大麻は日本において使用は罪ではなくて所持が罪になるらしい。なので、カリフォルニアで大麻料理（Hash oilなど）を食べるのは、もしかしたら日本国内で罰せられないかもしれない。興味はないが、知らずに出てくる可能性もあるのでちょっと安心だ。

9802 2018-03-07 02:02:13 important to remember that today is not 1:1 comparable to 1930s tariffs. 1. Not in a depression, 2. now service economy, 1930s industrial economy, 3. technology (productivity) can offset any short term disruptions; remember oil peaked and was never going below $140/barrel.

9818 2018-03-07 01:59:05 True bc oil cleanup is just...
9819 2018-03-07 01:58:59 This is the same @jkenney who thinks that the best way to export oil through BC is to stop sending any oil into BC. 
9820 2018-03-07 01:58:56 I agree that Katz wants to make money but I think he will make more by the Oilers being the best they can be.  The Oilers will be their best when they can develop quality youth consistently.  Losing money in Bakersfield to make more in Edmonton could work
9821 2018-03-07 01:58:54 In 2009, the State of Texas received over $1.4 billion in Natural Gas Production Taxes and $885 million in Oil Production Tax. Most of this money has come from the Permian, Eagleford, and Marcellus. #pge301

9927 2018-03-07 01:42:42 thx for explaining earnings/spending. I wonder how oil giants would do without giant taxpayer subsidies and huge loans from path dependent banks. Let's stop propping them up and instead invest in the future of energy. Oil is the past and the sooner we diversify the better.
9928 2018-03-07 01:42:12 100% right  of course we know that  is going to fan flames of discontent in democracies around the world especially us in west. Also imagine they have $ interests in oil disruption  however we in lower mainland are never going accept increase from 3 tankers to 35 a month
9929 2018-03-07 01:42:10 This is historic because both have offshore oil and gas in that region. Nice they could find an equitable way to decide things up.

9956 2018-03-07 01:37:45 Wind turbines take at least 500 litres of oil each changed 2-3 times a year. Instead of a few power plants that provide almost all the electricity demanded now you have 1000’s that hardly produce any electricity that all need parts and service.
9957 2018-03-07 01:37:45 Yes!
9958 2018-03-07 01:37:39 That’s a ‘Global’ Illuminati governing body hoax* Pictures and words and Doctors and Scientists are all a part of it. Trying to suppress the altruistic oil companies who are just working for the little man. Damn Illuminati.

9961 2018-03-07 01:37:06 You keep missing the point. The oil companies LEFT because of the carbon tax, the fossil fuel & pipeline  hatred, and things like McKenna’s ‘progressive’ distrust of men in groups. You don’t matter. Stop blaming Economics 101.
Whatever the NDP/Liberals pay you it’s too much.

9965 2018-03-07 01:36:20 I'm not saying Russia wouldn't mind if Kinder Morgan got scrapped (given that oil is one of their exports), but I think Mr.Kenney is underestimating the number of environmentally conscious people in BC who have a lot more to lose (from spills) than gain from this project.
