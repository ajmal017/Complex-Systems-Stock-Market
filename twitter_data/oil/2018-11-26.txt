2 2018-11-26 23:59:06 Nah, we're so dumb we like being led by the Trudeau's and Jerry Dias's of this world. They are intent on killing the oil industry, fkd up NAFTA & Tariff negotiations and ordered union journalists to go to war with elected members of parliament. 
What could possibly go wrong?

4 2018-11-26 23:58:48 Just woke up from a dream in which i got instantly evaporated by a oil refinery's explosion.

Gud morning.
5 2018-11-26 23:58:47 Funny, when oil was at 120, I don't remember folks out in Alberta were being charitable when Ontario manufacturing was getting creamed.
6 2018-11-26 23:58:40 If anyone sends you Oil Man you don't have to do it, lol
7 2018-11-26 23:58:38 And using a oil industry lobbying organization as a source might be a little biased.
8 2018-11-26 23:58:33 There is no need for the government cycle program. With the cost of petrol so high all familes will be on bikes soon so they will be able to teach the kids to ride. Until they ban the oil that lubricates the bikes, then we will all be on foot.

14 2018-11-26 23:57:28 Satu per satu produk skincare beralih ke Sensatia Botanica. Dari mulai cleanser, toner, dan vit c. Ada 1 lagi, facial oil. Nunggu facial oil yang udah dipake pada abis dulu. Yang beli share in cuma cleanser, lainnya beli nekat pas 11.11 kemarin. Alhamdulillah cocok-cocok aja.

33 2018-11-26 23:57:08 Why do we not have oil refineries in Western Canada?
34 2018-11-26 23:57:06 You are making gas prices go up, Do you have ANY knowledge of how economics work, you know, supply and demand? Hope your Saudis  increase oil products to us. Give ME, ordinary taxpayer, tax break. I rather get lump sum and not need to spend to get. Only you would call tax break.
35 2018-11-26 23:56:59 2/2 do not go online to read what the wrags are bullshitting publishing and their SNP/Scot Gov/ Yes Movement bad that way they can't influence us they can't divide us and we don't have watch read and listen to their propaganda unionist post they need our oil wealth they need us
36 2018-11-26 23:56:59 I went to @jiffylube last week to get an oil change and one of their employees put my money in his POCKET instead of the drawer and DIDN’T do my oil change! 

@jiffylube I want to know what are y’all going to do about the crooks stealing from customers??? @jiffylube @jiffylube
37 2018-11-26 23:56:49 LMAO!!! Your cheato let Saudi Arabia get away with the murder of a US Resident/Journalist. Then he tell us he negotiated a deal to lower oil prices and sell more arms..... Followed with a "winning" phrase. He just let the terrorists get away with murder. I dont stand with that bs
38 2018-11-26 23:56:47 School, fuck shit need her way to everything about oil sands in math Can't even crr revamping your math with stupid bb13
39 2018-11-26 23:56:36 @bigotires @Chris_Hawkey @PowerTripKFAN @MeatSauce1 @bloomington_mn @KFAN1003  Long story, but Big O Tires refused to change my wife’s oil because she defended other customers who were getting scammed on tire service, the same way they tried to with me.  Terrible service.
40 2018-11-26 23:56:16 I like that Red Dead 2 seems to imply that snake oil salesmen aren't frauds, they just have a very specific customer base in the form of superhuman gunslingers who need it to power their time slowing superpowers.
41 2018-11-26 23:56:08 May God help anyone who still finds oil jokes entertaining
42 2018-11-26 23:56:04 so do nothing because blah blah blah.  we get it. your reasons always change but the solutions are always the same.. do nothing.   just what the oil companies want.  do you know your repeating propaganda they paid for?  it's incredibly well documented. wake up
43 2018-11-26 23:55:59 i swear to god i tried but i didn’t understand shit HAGSG WDYM GELATIN IN THE OIL i’m- what kinda noodles have you been eating are you ok
44 2018-11-26 23:55:59 @fordnation listen..as much as I dislike trudeau he aint to blame on GM. Its been a long time comin man. This country has sucked of AMERICA for YEARS AND YEARS and has done ZILCH to create our own hi tec and our own initiatives at home.. only OIL and POT is what we have? not good
45 2018-11-26 23:55:34 Oil might be in it or it's off it's mount
46 2018-11-26 23:55:27 That's Trump for you. Nothing but a snake oil salesmen
47 2018-11-26 23:55:16 Snake oil, placebo. Tried so many different kinds. Does nothing.
48 2018-11-26 23:55:13 What about your other palm oil suppliers? #notodirtypalmoil
49 2018-11-26 23:55:10 But!! Trump let Saudi Arabia get away with the murder of a US Resident/Journalist. Then you tell us you negotiated a deal to lower oil prices and sell more arms..... Followed with a "winning" phrase. You let terrorists win right there pal! You sold this nations soul to the devil!
50 2018-11-26 23:55:09 Mexico will pay for Trumps BIG beautiful wall. You trumpites were sold a bill of goods by a snake oil salesman.
51 2018-11-26 23:55:08 Feeling bored, thinking of throwing water on an oil fire to see what happens
52 2018-11-26 23:54:52 @anthonyfurey @sunlorrie @joe_warmington in view of the serious decline in Alta’s oil and gas industry+the serious decline in Ont’s manufacturing sector, there is no sympathy for Quebec which sucks up $10 billion in equalization payments from Alta and Sask
53 2018-11-26 23:54:51 I think he burned the pan again. I told him this would happen if he uses water instead of oil but here we go
54 2018-11-26 23:54:47 “That was my plan, too. Except I was going to try and find it’s weak points!”

“And, maybe we should try to avoid creating any sparks or fire, the robot is an old oil machine, and we don’t want it to blow us up!”
55 2018-11-26 23:54:42 No. Oversupply and superior oil by other countries, including our biggest buyer, is why our oil is crashing. Our oil is more expensive to process because tar sands suck.

America hates us and has more oil than ever.
56 2018-11-26 23:54:35 How many @foxnews channels does he NEED to sell his snake oil?
57 2018-11-26 23:54:30 Okay but do yall believe in global warming? You support a president who is ENDORSED BY THE OIL AND COAL PARTY AND BY ENTITIES WHO LITERALLY SUPPRESS SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE, and you wanna mouth off about free speech?
58 2018-11-26 23:54:28 You don't think that's a gross oversimplification of the challenges our energy sector faces? You want to got on record as saying our oil sands and their workers would be better off if the federal and provincial governments removed all financial supports?
59 2018-11-26 23:54:27 I do not know -- honestly -- the impact of QT on oil or other commodity prices, either.
60 2018-11-26 23:54:24 My friend is off 3 medications since using this CBD oil!! WIN!! 
61 2018-11-26 23:54:20 This is Trump's second visit to Mississippi as President. Obama was in Mississippi for about an hour in eight years, during the BP oil spill. Made some comments in Jackson while Air Force One fueled up.
62 2018-11-26 23:54:20 felt like I was drinking coconut oil the first time I tasted it 
63 2018-11-26 23:54:19 Yes but they don't have oil fields to use as collateral
64 2018-11-26 23:54:17 Ladies and gentlemen: #ROC may be birthplace of consumer film, @xerox, 1st car patent, etc., but DYK: Vacuum Oil Co., later Mobil Oil, later @exxonmobil, was founded in Rochester in 1866? Also, 1st mass-produced marshmallow was borne of the Rochester Marshmallow Company in 1895
65 2018-11-26 23:53:48 Drop in oil is net positive for economy, effective tax cut for households which extends beyond single sector hiring trends and investments. Spiking oils prices have preceded last five economic recessions. But I agree there are many cross currents.
66 2018-11-26 23:53:44 Better get investing in electric rather than oil huh
67 2018-11-26 23:53:43 Oil drives the world. That doesn't make economic suicide a good idea. Renewables are coming along more and more, but forcing an artificial reckoning will hurt us all far more.
68 2018-11-26 23:53:43 GENERAL MOTORS closing 5 plants. They refuse to make car that will sell.  OIL COMPANIES keep them,  & all auto makers, from making car that gets 50 or more MPG. WONDER who is behind their closing?  MIGHT surprise all of us if it were known.
69 2018-11-26 23:53:40 And virgin olive oil
70 2018-11-26 23:53:39 went to mr lube today for an oil change & came out with an oil change, 2 new filters and an engine flush. apparently I can’t say no 
71 2018-11-26 23:53:36 So am I. A single hull ship steered by a drunk. We are SO far past that. This Gov't is purposely shutting oil in.
72 2018-11-26 23:53:28 Use olive oil:)
73 2018-11-26 23:53:27 But!! You let Saudi Arabia get away with the murder of a US Resident/Journalist. Then you tell us you negotiated a deal to lower oil prices and sell more arms..... Followed with a "winning" phrase. You let terrorists win right there pal!
74 2018-11-26 23:53:14 Se les hizo engrudo la 4ta transformación.
1. En cualquier momento Trump puede cerrar frontera y echar para atrás la firma en tanto no hagan nada con las caravanas.
2. Urge un bozal para los senadores morenistas y sus ideas.
3. Precio del oil, a la baja
4. Guerra com. Usa/China
75 2018-11-26 23:53:13 Oh, dry socket sucks.  Oil of clove did not help me, though.
76 2018-11-26 23:53:05 Pre good, had a Science test today. How about you, m’dude?
77 2018-11-26 23:53:02 Very wise words. Especially in a canoe. 
78 2018-11-26 23:52:56 “I don’t believe it ‘cos all those oil, gas & coal Guys, who buy my apartments, golf at my resorts with me & pay me millions of dollars secretly, tell me climate change isn’t a REAL thing! I believe them rather than hundreds of scientists, academics & researchers who pay me zilch
79 2018-11-26 23:52:52 Pretty ass nigga !! Nigga prob got on baby  oil right now!
80 2018-11-26 23:52:36 Pampered myself tonight, face wash, beard oil AND hand & nail cream #wilding
81 2018-11-26 23:52:30 THESE CORPORATIONS DON'T HAVE TO PAY BACK THE BAILOUT BECAUSE THEY ARE OWNED BY THE GLOBAL ELITE.  SO ARE  THE BANKS, OIL, THE UNITED NATIONS, ETC.  THAT'S WHY OUR POLITICIANS JUST GIVE THEM THE BAILOUT MONEY AND RUN DEFICITS AND WE AS TAXPAYERS GO IN DEBT AND FOOT THE BILL.
82 2018-11-26 23:52:27 OMG! Was it an accident? So sorry you've had to go through all that hun x
83 2018-11-26 23:52:18 I was making sloppy joes last time and when I put the beef on the stove my dad really yelled at me “where’s the oil!!!!!!”
84 2018-11-26 23:52:10 I'm sure they did, but if they'd bothered to market them a little, they might've had a chance! The other problem seems to be that the current administration is adamant about tearing down solar & other environmentally-friendly initiatives, sticking w/coal & oil.  Not the future.
85 2018-11-26 23:51:57 I'm not stupid that's motor oil
86 2018-11-26 23:51:56 just watched a pancake commercial and all I could see was motor oil and cardboard so thank you twitter for ruining my life
87 2018-11-26 23:51:53 How do we build the smart TV app that uses facial recognition on the cable news panels, then superimposes on them a NASCAR-style set of corporate logos representing their backers, like a SnapChat filter? So when, say, Rick Santorum appears, an oil rig logo shows on his lapel.
88 2018-11-26 23:51:40 I haven't read the novels because the quotes I've see grossed me out so much I couldn't imagine wanting to inhabit that mind-space. (Not saying that everything has to be "relatable!") But I appreciate yr generous approach. Now putting oil on the hinges of my mind to creak it open
89 2018-11-26 23:51:38 And the big oil and gas moguls aren't?  How many billionaire scientists do you know?
90 2018-11-26 23:51:21 Bet that oil ain't been changed yet 
91 2018-11-26 23:50:57 Tried motor oil ?!
92 2018-11-26 23:50:53 Yeah.... future... as in.... future

Even green tech requires petroleum in its build

So you wanting oil to die today is shooting yourself in carbon foot(print)
93 2018-11-26 23:50:44 I took my car to get my oil changed today instead of leaving it for my parents to deal with. Is this what being an adult feels like
94 2018-11-26 23:50:34 Me when I go to subway and I only want vinegar but they also put oil 
95 2018-11-26 23:50:23 So we’re gonna ignore the fact that American corporations & oil companies bulldoze, exploit, & poison countries throughout Latin America & all over the world, making their lands uninhabitable. The soil, water, & air is literally toxic, causing cancer & other illnesses
96 2018-11-26 23:50:20 Vitamin E oil has my eyelashes super long I still have scars on my face but eyelashes are flourishing it's a noticeable difference

103 2018-11-26 23:49:53 Haven't tried it, but I met the owners of the company recently. Seemed very genuine. I also think @ketochow is a standup product. (Mix shake mix with heavy cream or oil and water.)
104 2018-11-26 23:49:52 And then there is OUR oil revenue......
105 2018-11-26 23:49:46 So the snake oil saleman lied. NO WAY. The corp got the tax break, gave their upper management the bennies & screwed the worker. NONE of you all saw this coming? You voted for him, you go down with him.
106 2018-11-26 23:49:36 When my sister was 3yo, she was typical toddler who threw tantrums. Our church's pastors convinced my mother that she was demon possessed, so a bunch of elders anointed her head w/oil and prayed those demons out. 40 yrs later my Mom is so embarassed that she fell for that shit.

110 2018-11-26 23:49:09 Tried CBD oil gummies today.  
So far not impressed.  But that may because I prefer the medical grade ‘jazz cabbage’ instead.
111 2018-11-26 23:49:09 I don't know but that's the wrong question to be asking, we should be asking what we as an oil & gas industry need to do to satisfy reasonable people within Canada to allow projects like trans mountain to go ahead, a near 100% approval rate for enviro. assess. isn't good
112 2018-11-26 23:49:08 #FoilHatOn Perhaps that's been the plan all along. Dethrone Ghosn, blame him for the Leaf fiasco, and perpetuate the oil cabal. Call me 
113 2018-11-26 23:48:48 Yes trump is steadfast on choking the shale revolution that has been able to  mitigate this. Had there never been a resurgence of US oil and natural gas the where would we be today, likely even closer to a world war as the economy slowly drifts towards parity w/China
114 2018-11-26 23:48:47 People saying it’s motor oil and not syrup I’m still confused on how it’s funny though 
115 2018-11-26 23:48:41 That chest..
...I just wanna rub warm oil on him. 
116 2018-11-26 23:48:41 Imma drink that oil
117 2018-11-26 23:48:39 I’m sorry ...That is just gross .. I’m sure each treatment costs a small fortune ....Thank you but no thank you ... I will just continue using oil of Olay ..
118 2018-11-26 23:48:35 Associated Gas equally important IMHO as Oil shale plays produce a tremendous amount as long as WTI price high & credit/debt cheap  (flare more than they should..) as important
119 2018-11-26 23:48:34 There are some ear mite treatments that can be used on all pets in the house without issues.

121 2018-11-26 23:48:19 Idk why I keep buying other products for my hair knowing damn well it’s not going to work only my aloe oil.
122 2018-11-26 23:48:06 Need to publish oil differential price on All newscasts to emphasize the problem
123 2018-11-26 23:47:59 I took him Ketologie. Organic clean ingredients, collagen & coconut oil, and great as hot chocolate in the winter. I drink those myself. They make the Roast Chicken Bone Broth too, also with collagen added. Have you tried it?
124 2018-11-26 23:47:51 Run away from persecution and poverty, we’ll have you arrested & split up your family. 

Chop-up a US resident because he disagrees with you, we’ll look the other way because oil and defense contracts.

125 2018-11-26 23:47:50 How far thhat presumption should stick is the billion dollar oil question.
126 2018-11-26 23:47:46 But it's okay for America to help those peaceful Muslims cause oil.
127 2018-11-26 23:47:46 is that PALM OIL...
128 2018-11-26 23:47:45 What she said wasn’t even right  it is like adding oil to the burning fire. She could’ve said it in a better way tho tbh

This is absolutely unacceptable

134 2018-11-26 23:46:39 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?
135 2018-11-26 23:46:22 Inflation went up 11% in Oct to 2.52% despite oil prices falling by >10% during same period. Btw that's above the Fed target-2%. Oil prices are falling because ur trade policies are causing an economic slowdown in EU & Asia lowering demand in oil & other prods incl US made prods.
136 2018-11-26 23:46:22 Google “Joe Barton Rep from Texas apologize to BP CEO On oil spill in Gulf” . That was GOP and for last two years they have been silent.
137 2018-11-26 23:46:15 The previous Conservative governments in your province refused to save for the bust times. Oil is boom or bust.  They should have planned accordingly. Stop blaming Trudeau and put the blame where it belongs.
138 2018-11-26 23:46:13 the oil money has to run out sometime
139 2018-11-26 23:46:09 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, yet the open border policies of this Administration.

145 2018-11-26 23:45:43 What???? What???? Besides the fact you hate whites what are you talking about the oil sands are for Alberta?
146 2018-11-26 23:45:33 Oh I absolutely agree with this. We must stop burning oil.
147 2018-11-26 23:45:29 Very good points! Its so good that they've got people talking/thinking about it and great that they can make their products without it, but sustainable palm oil should be the main goal here, and a reduction in meat consumption is essential! Shared!
148 2018-11-26 23:45:22 Seriously boss... Cos somehow she fit Don find her way enter kitchen begin lick maggi, drink oil even chop raw meat wey dey fridge for the bill to reach 83k....
One person?? Tùfiakwa
149 2018-11-26 23:45:21 They use motor oil instead of syrup for food pictures because it doesn’t soak into the food & the color is more appealing

152 2018-11-26 23:45:15 Libs just bought a pipeline to get oil to tidewater, also approved the keystone xl

154 2018-11-26 23:44:59 Good evening! Oil&Gas customers of mine. WTI Crude Oil (10/03/2015): 48,29 USD/barrel. BRENT (10/03/2015): 56,39 USD/barrel.
155 2018-11-26 23:44:53 Who spending 8$ on some oil ? Not me
156 2018-11-26 23:44:53 I need to learn how to do an oil change. Valvoline trips are getting too stressful for me.
157 2018-11-26 23:44:52 started feeling sick a few days ago so I popped an ACV pill & a black seed oil pill. symptoms went away by the next day. echinacea could NEVER.
158 2018-11-26 23:44:52 Dawg I just spilled so much oil on the kitchen floor and I literally sat down for like 2 minutes trying olor figure out how to clean it without my mom noticing while she sat in the living room...
159 2018-11-26 23:44:51 yall was putting straight up coconut oil on your faces. i aint forget.
160 2018-11-26 23:44:51 Someone better tell the Norwegians their oil is running out eh @LeaskyHT
161 2018-11-26 23:44:47 I got oil on my face again... How does it even get there...? -bot-
162 2018-11-26 23:44:35 Libs just bought a pipeline to get AB oil to tidewater
163 2018-11-26 23:44:32 There are people who think coconut oil can be used as sunscreen. I’m pretty sure they don’t vaccinate their kids either.
164 2018-11-26 23:44:30 Enjoying how this bear market has weeded out the 'experts' who have been crawling all over CT the last 2 years. Their 'prophetic' oil has run dry. During next bull run they will come out with such a screaming bang that one would be forgiven to think $BTC is mined up their colons.
165 2018-11-26 23:44:30 Basically soybean meal and oil.
166 2018-11-26 23:44:28 Successive conservative gov'ts have failed to nationalize the debate and let folks know that the industry benefits everyone in Canada. Every province is represented in the workforce of oil sands. We failed drum home the fact that pipelines are a Canadian product.
167 2018-11-26 23:44:23 shoutout to the guy at the auto shop who gave me a discount on my oil change, you a true king :,)
168 2018-11-26 23:44:23 Yay, GMO crap oil! Completely amazing! Then farmers don't rotate crops, crops get sprayed for bugs and weeds, soil is destroyed, but gotta keep growing that cheap crap oil!
169 2018-11-26 23:44:21 @BenSasse Stephen, FB, TW, G, AMZ, APL control what you see, hear, read on the internet. They are the gatekeepers of information. They have enormous power beyond anything ATT or Standard Oil dreamed of & they use it as a political weapon. They are monopolies! Regulate or BreakUp
170 2018-11-26 23:44:20 Trudeau buys pipeline ($4.5 billion) to support oil corporations exporting raw resources, gives $16 billion in foregone govt  revenue to corporations (something something competitiveness), $600 million to media corporations.

Nothing for postal or auto workers.  #pnpcbc #cdnpoli

172 2018-11-26 23:44:19 I really wanna try cbd oil for my anxiety
173 2018-11-26 23:44:06 Apparently, because the fish oil from the blended fish eyes is bad for her “dodgy heart” (can’t seem to find info on that weirdly enough) even though fish oil is good for heart health. But I’ve been accused of bullying this guy for having a different opinion to him so 
174 2018-11-26 23:44:04 I'm not a scientist but you have to admit that 48% of that huuuge group believes that snow exists, and Trump cares about oil, I mean you
175 2018-11-26 23:44:02 Hi Caroline, I'd like to buy the Tubbs n Edward acrylic plus the Bowie oil pastel please. I live in Skipton so happy to collect and pay cash if appropriate. DM me with details for collection ta

177 2018-11-26 23:43:59 Ladies it’s winter time get ur oil and tires checked
178 2018-11-26 23:43:55 GM closures as they transition to elec. propulsion, autonomous vehicles and ride share- 3/4 of a bbl goes to gas & diesel. Ask instead how AB transitions from oil to ???? in <20 years. That's leadership, vision. I like you a lot but polishing portholes, sinking ship, questions.
179 2018-11-26 23:43:48 If I go missing put me on almond milk cartons and coconut oil jars, is all I ask. If I go on a regular milk carton or on those walls at every store, I’m gonna tell my kidnapper to just kill me.
180 2018-11-26 23:43:41 @VinnieTortorich vinnie, my teenage son is a stick, any idea how to help him gain weight? My wife thinks olive oil and butter. I say fat doesn't make you fat but she won't listen.
181 2018-11-26 23:43:27 Because of the oil price crash and reduced provincial revenues ........ of course 
182 2018-11-26 23:43:12 Sure, just pass the cost to the workforce & cut services to working folks so oil cotps can get another tax cut.

The @cfib agenda.

186 2018-11-26 23:42:46 Make American oil expensive again
187 2018-11-26 23:42:40 Imagine cheering for some half baked, half bleached snake oil salesman claiming to have found a "magic wand" when it comes to a worldwide industry.
188 2018-11-26 23:42:39 About the same as 9 Oshawa plants in rural Alberta.  Will Trudeau nationalize the oil industry?
189 2018-11-26 23:42:20 You gonna pay for my fuel oil? didn’t think so.. so quit bitching! #myhouse #notyours
190 2018-11-26 23:42:14 i got some personal oil diffusers/inhalers that look kinda like vapes and they seem to help some already
191 2018-11-26 23:42:12 With out a doubt, #Fordnation  to blame for "below market" oil prices now crippling #Alberta. Nothing to do with trudea pipeline fiascos.  #tcot
192 2018-11-26 23:41:58 twitter pals, help a goy out. I am making latkes tomorrow for the first time and want to know all your tips and tricks. what's the best potato to use? which frying oil works best? are latkes actually just McDonalds hashbrowns sewn together? thnx
193 2018-11-26 23:41:55 One of these frickin days you should consider paying attention to what is going on in Canada! Plants closing, oil industry in turmoil, stock market doing lousy compared to US - but you keep flying around and taking selfies. #TrudeauMustGo
194 2018-11-26 23:41:48 GOP and Drumpf always follow Goebbell’s handbook- they blame others for that which they are guilty of.  They are up to their chins in gas and oil lobby money
195 2018-11-26 23:41:44 I’m guessing old Tom never took a penny from oil companies
196 2018-11-26 23:41:34 I'm talking about the salted brown ones in oil (umami), not the silvery white ones in brine (fishy).
197 2018-11-26 23:41:26 @Space_NK hi! I recently bought the Hourglass Veil Mineral Primer from you in the 60ml. The packaging is a little different than expected though - it no longer lists “oil free” on the tube. Is it just the packaging that has changed or has the product changed do you know?
198 2018-11-26 23:41:25 Stop using palm oil please
199 2018-11-26 23:41:24 @ChickfilA‘s essential oil is Peanut Oil

201 2018-11-26 23:41:12 Where's my Cheer Fight promos? More Kim Possible oil wrestling!!!!!! PLEASE !!!!!!! #oilwrestling #kimpossible #cheerfight
202 2018-11-26 23:41:10 Quick question for my assignment. Do you all believe trump is embracing Saudi Arabia to keep the oil prices low?
203 2018-11-26 23:41:01 I would definitely say how to do your own 1040EZ for taxes, the importance of saving for retirement (and why it's better to start young), how to put air in tires (don't judge, I know how now), changing your car's oil, balancing a check book, and budgeting
204 2018-11-26 23:40:44 He did it with oil, very possible.  Like 3D chess against Data lol
205 2018-11-26 23:40:32 ジルバさんの手品スゲーよなー！
206 2018-11-26 23:40:27 long-term might be really long-term though — costs keep dropping for oil / natural gas too
207 2018-11-26 23:40:22 Looking like the federal provincial and municipal government of Alberta want blue collar workers out.  #alberta oil #tax hikes # leave Alberta

212 2018-11-26 23:39:51 Heat up mince pie, dollop of cream, to go with the palm oil... 
Oh hang on. On second thoughts, I'll pass.
213 2018-11-26 23:39:48 The @cdnliberalparty definitely believes in climate change. They just also believe that the only wait to fight climate change is to export more oil... Only in Canada.

218 2018-11-26 23:39:37 And yet we stay as part of a failed confederation while Prime Minister Trudeau and the Liberal party of Canada deliberately destroy the Alberta oil Industry and the Alberta economy, What does that say about us?

224 2018-11-26 23:39:21 Yes, yes of course the evil scientists are spreading propoganda to sabatogue the world with renewable energy, while oil tycoons & other corporate polluters only have the best interests of humanity at heart...

227 2018-11-26 23:39:04 omg the internet's so hurt after that video of photographers/filmographers using motor oil as syrup came out
228 2018-11-26 23:39:02 まさか…地球からの…ふぁぼ！？
229 2018-11-26 23:38:46 Friens if science are an oil industry funded libby group. Their "reports" are well known frauds .
230 2018-11-26 23:38:45 Is that it!?  That’s all you got!?  Just because part of our business is trucks?  It’s not solely operated in this area.  It covers other oil and gas territories but I don’t believe you would understand that.  I destroyed your narrative... took your cape!  Get over it. Move on!
231 2018-11-26 23:38:29 Don't understand why people will oppose pipelines. It is the best and safest way to transport oil.  People oppose it because of Alberta Conservative politician have failed us. Over the years, the oil sands are for Alberta except when it needs help from other provinces.
232 2018-11-26 23:38:29 Thanks for reaching out regarding your concerns! Please note that price differences among fuel stations in a given geographical area may occur due to area competition, fluctuations in the oil market, supply disruptions, and the fact that fuel centers often do not receive (1/2)
233 2018-11-26 23:38:28 motor oil
234 2018-11-26 23:38:25 Don’t tell me what to do with my Aggie oil money.
235 2018-11-26 23:38:15 Good. Now get off that oil and gas addiction.
236 2018-11-26 23:38:12 What bothers me even more than the alarming next level third person self ref, is trying to justify his role in the Khashoggi murder cover up by lying about lower oil prices.
237 2018-11-26 23:38:04 The prices of our products depend on which auto parts stores you purchase from. Since, we do not sell directly to consumers, we cannot give a price of the products.
238 2018-11-26 23:38:01 Yemen, Syria, Hezbollah ... just to name a few, with the country’s oil revenue . Or you consider that defending yourself ?
239 2018-11-26 23:37:55 The city must never forget that if oil don’t move it don’t sell #Alberta oil. If oil don’t sell people have no jobs. #alberta economic development.   If workers in Alberta loose good paying jobs people of Alberta can’t afford life’s necessities. #city of Edmonton tax hikes.
240 2018-11-26 23:37:36 Did you use napalm instead of oil to do the eggs?
241 2018-11-26 23:37:35 Motor oil with sugar...sounds like an American food dish!!
242 2018-11-26 23:37:34 To play your game here, ain't energy independence a defense issue? If civvies aren't burning oil, that's more left to fuel the F-22s. You know, in the coming resource wars.
243 2018-11-26 23:37:33 渾身のネタツイの直後に地震起こすのやめて欲しい
244 2018-11-26 23:37:30 Many oil workers fall for corporate/conservative govts BS and they fight against progress and moving away from fossil fuels. Even if it means jobs in less volatile industries.

Instead of caring about what is best for themselves and Canada, they just want to "own the libs"
245 2018-11-26 23:37:30 Personally I like the way the oven roasts the top with some olive oil, salt and pepper. The microwave cooks it but doesn’t give it any colour or flavour.
246 2018-11-26 23:37:27 Olive oil, salt/pepper/garlic powder- 425 degree oven 30 minutes. Bomb.
247 2018-11-26 23:37:19 But Istg I heard so many rumours growing up like if I think about it they sound so dumb like i heard that we shouldn't eat it since it were worms or that gelatin was in the oil AND IF I THINK ABOUT IT BACK THEY SOUND SO DUMBBB

250 2018-11-26 23:36:53 Ukraine didnt declare war, it declared full alert and martial law inside Ukraine. 
Ukraine will lose any war against RF, but showing that RF is aggressor and bully that s the point with economic sanctions and oil for 50$, and less business it ll be enough to weaken Putin regime
251 2018-11-26 23:36:48 揺れたなぁ……
252 2018-11-26 23:36:48 Self respect is removing the “recommended oil change” sticker from your car when you roll up to spare these people the knowledge of just how much you suck
253 2018-11-26 23:36:45 I try to use organic or non toxic cleaning supplies esp with Kiki and how it’s harmful to dogs to inhale but my favorite is Mrs. Meyers esp their essential oil air freshener I Just bought a lavender one
254 2018-11-26 23:36:40 let the steaming hot motor oil drip down ur bare chest
255 2018-11-26 23:36:39 They use oil in commercials not syrup
256 2018-11-26 23:36:35 Oil companies are the scariest gangsters on the block. I don’t credit gangsters with enough imagination to come up with a protection racket. At first, people volunteered money out of loyalty. The greed label came later. Deniers will change allegiance as soon as big oil falters.
257 2018-11-26 23:36:27 @nailogical SOOOO... I was watching "how to grow your nails fast" and I need some advice. I'm broke and can't buy jojoba oil, but I have some that's 90% Olive and 10% jojoba. Will it work? HELP PLZ IM DESPERATE MY NAILS ARE SO SHORT.... I had a devestating break. 
258 2018-11-26 23:36:22 Further I think we have a right to know how much money people like Santorum and Pletka get from oil interests to spread their denier bullshit.
259 2018-11-26 23:36:22 If she's tight ...use engine oil.

Good night
260 2018-11-26 23:36:18 You don’t understand....When it comes to Ramón I will be CAMPING out at the Oil Palace while you’re walking across the stage at 10am
261 2018-11-26 23:36:17 @WhiteHouse @GOP @DNC @ENERGY @NancyPelosi @senatemajldr 2)IMO @POTUS : US will use Oil+Gas+Coal+Nuclear for Plastics,Steel,Fertilizer,Medicines for years , we know that,but to go against Solar,Wind, Electric Cars ? That's to go against Trump tweet phone & F-35 electric networks

264 2018-11-26 23:35:56 Most of profit for last couple of years has been in China.  Ford phasing out production of sedans, cause they just dont sell that well
265 2018-11-26 23:35:52 Until someone discovers oil or gas beside it 
266 2018-11-26 23:35:46 Hadoooh emang bener yaa sekalinya ngantuk langsung ga sadar:((( sampe udah 2x lupa pake face oil sebelum tidur
267 2018-11-26 23:35:29 Oversupply. 

U.S. oil production topped 11 million barrels a day earlier this year, according to the Energy Information Administration, sparking fears that supplies will overwhelm demand. Major producers Russia and Saudi Arabia are also seen producing at record levels.
268 2018-11-26 23:35:20 yeah, cut down the oil price, low down the logistics cost, and you‘d better cancel the tax, let americans live a better life.
269 2018-11-26 23:35:19 Supply glut of oil and ethanol. Not a Ford thing!
270 2018-11-26 23:35:15 集まり悪いな。皆何やってるの。集合だよ。集合。
271 2018-11-26 23:35:05 Ezra has been pushing the ethical oil issues for a very, very long time.  I remember reading his editorials and columns on this  from the mid 2000s.
Thanks for never giving up on this, Ezra, and for ensuring that you will always have Canada's oil industry's back.
272 2018-11-26 23:34:35 Oil leak and hellaaaa other stuff so I’m just tryna come up with all the money to get everything fixed
273 2018-11-26 23:34:30 GM just gave tiny trump a look at what the rest of the world has already figured out. Oil and coal are not our future, and to not move towards alternative means of living and traveling, tiny trump will lead us into a recession or worse.
274 2018-11-26 23:34:23 He didn't read it! He doesn't care! It's all about the oil! So much if this is about averice, not ignorance.
275 2018-11-26 23:34:21 地震
276 2018-11-26 23:34:18 Promote public ownership of our natural resources to prevent these issues. As well as moving away from fossil fuels by investing in green energy jobs and education for the oil workers.

Join unions.

Stop voting for right wing govts who only care about businesses and the wealthy.
277 2018-11-26 23:34:17 I didn’t realize it was a competition. Canadians from coast to coast are hurting by Trudeau’s hand. An unemployed oil worker in AB is suffering the same as an unemployed auto worker in ON. “The east” is screwing AB. QC politicians (including Trudeau) are.
278 2018-11-26 23:34:17 It's still a shitty solution. For all the extra hours put in, US gdp per capita is only 16% higher than Sweden's and far lower than Norway's.

And Sweden doesn't have oil.
279 2018-11-26 23:34:11 Thanks!! My wife found it online and ordered it, and it has shipped. So fingers crossed. He’s on gabapentin, tramadol, deramaxx, fish oil, cosequin, and we’re looking into acupuncture. But it seems crazy that we can’t get CBD oil for him at the store here.
280 2018-11-26 23:34:07 I'm paying anywhere from $3.29-$3.42 this week in S. Oregon. I know there's wars because of politics but backing the killing of a Journalist to get cheaper oil is sickening. I'm disgusted & embarrassed that our POTUS (Trump) is derainged, corrupt, stupid & belittles our Gov daily

282 2018-11-26 23:33:49 Need an oil and some Shea butter
283 2018-11-26 23:33:46 Nor me! I'd better just go with the flow and see see where it takes me 
284 2018-11-26 23:33:45 That would be a valId argument if only Albertans lost their jobs with Ron’s stats. You do know that people from other provinces work in Oil & Gas in AB?
285 2018-11-26 23:33:42 Poor thing slipped on the remnants of oil and chicken on the floor
286 2018-11-26 23:33:39 Moisturize your natural hair with the L.O.C method. Moisturize your hair with LIQUID, water is the best choice. Seal in the moisture with some OIL. The oil slows down the evaporation of the water which keeps your hair hydrated. Then double seal with hair CREAM
287 2018-11-26 23:33:37 But thats at the ideological core of the Liberals intent in destroying the entire oil infratructure / consumption in search of massive tax increases to fund said ideology. Its a multi faceted war.
288 2018-11-26 23:33:36 That's right. I'm at lunds and byerly's over near the essential oils and I'm trying out all the spending ones. 

The more expensive the oil I'm testing, the fancier things get.
289 2018-11-26 23:33:31 Wouldn't the oil in a tea be as good as the gels???
290 2018-11-26 23:33:23 i haven't eaten but i'm scared to drive again bc it says my oil level is at 15% i am not an automobile lesbian someone help
291 2018-11-26 23:33:18 Why you think so? No one knows it’s THC oil. My only thing is, the people I LwYs see with them on international flights are white
292 2018-11-26 23:33:04 Yes they are lol had both sides of my pelvis broken in 3 places, plated and screwed, then metal out. One femur lengthened 2 inches then plated, metal out, then other femur derotated plated then metal out, etc so it's a long road to recovery
293 2018-11-26 23:32:55 Went to my grandparents seen my nan had an oil burner. So what did I do when I got home? Spent 35 pound on mosaic oil burners 
294 2018-11-26 23:32:51 Make up your mind. 
Fossil fuels bad, cars that use them bad, living in cities stacked on top of one another where you have no place to park a car is good.
And it couldn't have anything to do with them offering products that just aren't that appealing?
295 2018-11-26 23:32:49 jamaican castor oil mixed w. wild hair growth oil!!! gurllllllll worked wonders i tell u
296 2018-11-26 23:32:49 Because oil workers blindly support an industry that continues to screw people, even when the jobs are outsourced or they hire cheap foreign labour to replace staff paid higher wages.

Both industries are foreign companies fucking us over. But oil is environmentally worse.
297 2018-11-26 23:32:26 You may ne right. However cant count on Saudis forever and quite frankly the infrastructure work provides so many jobs. It's a win win. Oil will still be needed for another 50 years like it or not. Reduced cost on Alberta crude hurts the entire country.
298 2018-11-26 23:32:12 And have oil revenue......
299 2018-11-26 23:32:00 The IEA has worked out the carbon price needed to stabilize CO2 at 450 ppm / 2C: US $20/t by 2020, $100/t by 2030, $140/t by 2040. Even in 450 ppm scenario, oil demand doesn't drop off a cliff. We need to reduce CO2 emissions from our oil production, not just move it elsewhere.
300 2018-11-26 23:31:52 They will ALWAYS deny it Kamala.  Wealthy, greedy men don't want to give up their EXTRAVIGANT lifestyle.  Yachts, speed boats, fast cars, helocpoters, jets, coal mines, oil....THEIR carbon  footprint isnt looked at as a pollutant in our environment.
301 2018-11-26 23:31:39 This isn't "Trump's love affair". We've been in this bizarre codependent relationship with Saudi Arabia since the 1950's. We need cheap oil, they need somebody to buy their oil. Their culture has always been contrary to ours, yet we've always continued to do business with them.
302 2018-11-26 23:31:24 yet no concern about all of those oil tankers coming down the coast from Alaska going to the US. How ironic outrage to save the environment that only affects the Canadian economy while not a peep about environmental issues that would stop tankers flowing down the coast.
303 2018-11-26 23:31:24 Holy surgery! That's a lot of ops!!! Are they trying to rebuild you?! #BionicWoman lol

304 2018-11-26 23:31:17 What you “believe” @realDonaldTrump has zero credibility #ClimateChange is real. Your support of oil & coal, of poisoning the planet, your denigration of #SustainableEnergy, your ignorance & #Greed ensures your downfall. A #OneTermPresident, or thrown out on your ear before #2020

306 2018-11-26 23:30:54 It is not the Indigenous. The damn foreign money NGO's Hive etc. They decided to landlock our oil over 10 years ago and they are using them for their cause
307 2018-11-26 23:30:48 I'm old enough to remember all the past scares that others have pushed. We didn't run out of food, we didn't freeze to death, we didn't run out of oil. Crying wolf again ! Climate change happens. No big deal. Earth will heal. Stop this!
308 2018-11-26 23:30:48 Oil prices are down, yet gas prices are going up? Wtf @realDonaldTrump ???
309 2018-11-26 23:30:47 If you look at countries like Venezuela, before they voted in a socialist government, it’s was very prosperous with a booming oil industry. It wasn’t free trade that crippled it, but a dissatisfied people who voted for it. Now they must rebuild. That’s life.
310 2018-11-26 23:30:43 I'm not an SNP fan, but they WILL stand up for Scotland and her people. What have the other sheep done?
Scotland needs independence. We are being sodomised by Westminster. We are oil producers. Where is our wealth? In fat cat political party supporting pockets.
311 2018-11-26 23:30:39 They also think that electric cars are better. They never think past their plug in. Where does that power come from? Like I said, dumb.

315 2018-11-26 23:30:30 Accidentally marinated my steak with sesame oil.  We'll see how this goes.
316 2018-11-26 23:30:29 So the dollar was backed by gold. Now its government regulation that backs it? Is government regulation going to prevent it from losing ALL its value if these other countries start selling oil in a different currency?
317 2018-11-26 23:30:12 Trying to get cruzey ready for ya. It’s got a oil leak that smells horrible when you put the heat on  we will get it fixed for ya
318 2018-11-26 23:30:11 The climate fraud cult that infests the PMO is pleased these nasty cars wont get built.Downstream emissions and such.And just like the oil patch workers in Alberta these workers can pound sand. #LiberalsHateCanada #cndpoli

320 2018-11-26 23:30:02 2/ pipelines leaking oil, oil leaking into the ocean, so the bottom line is 45 is allowing his friends to continue to destroy our country and 45 couldn’t care less. He is definitely aware of CC he just doesn’t give a rats ass.
321 2018-11-26 23:29:58 People should Google a programme called "Wasted Windfall", highlighted our failure to make the most of our oil revenue.
322 2018-11-26 23:29:54 I live in Vancouver, which is as environmentally advanced as any city in North America. I commute to work by electric bike myself. But we still have a huge number of cars and trucks on the roads. As long as Vancouver needs oil, so will other people.
323 2018-11-26 23:29:54 im sitting here, baby oil in my ear
324 2018-11-26 23:29:47 the worst part about growing up is that all you want for christmas are things you actually need like an oil change or new headlights..

327 2018-11-26 23:28:31 2 hours for an oil change... makes sense
328 2018-11-26 23:28:27 somebody oil my scalp for me.
329 2018-11-26 23:28:21 Trained oil analyst using an IPO price to put forward an argument whether a company is a good investment or not? Please give it a rest. I'm well up over 100% in #FRR 

Did you train to make personal insults too or does that come naturally?
330 2018-11-26 23:28:19 That’s motor oil beloved.
331 2018-11-26 23:28:16 I assume he's in the pocket of the oil and gas industry?

333 2018-11-26 23:28:09 It was error from Finland to accept the settlement with small monetary compensation. The bridge clearly violates the maritime law. At that time Finland was only worried about oil rigs which did not fit under. But very soon it blocked Finland for building any bigger cruise ships.
334 2018-11-26 23:28:04 No, not to my place. I have already seen the disastrous results of illegal invasion in CA, including the vicious murder of a loved one who was a pastor, destruction of apartments by 16 people living in a 2 BR apt and cooking on the floor, rumping motor oil in the water system. NO
335 2018-11-26 23:27:45 Anyone traveled outta the US with weed oil n vape pen? Wanna know how or if I should
336 2018-11-26 23:27:43 Can u get the soft gels legally like the oil?
337 2018-11-26 23:27:42 what do you mean the peppermint mocha from starbucks isn't just coffee, peppermint essential oil, and dark cacao nibs??
338 2018-11-26 23:27:39 to be fair, he's not the only one. The entire twitter farce in response to first oil last week was - like much of scottish political twitter - based on some fabricated 'memories' of a bunch of stuff that didn't happen.
339 2018-11-26 23:27:33 There are literally primary documents detailing oil giants preparing for climate change and the fucksticks still won’t believe it’s happening.
340 2018-11-26 23:27:33 Old Snake Oil Salesman's mindset in '16 and it's his mindset today.
341 2018-11-26 23:27:16 An #Obama administration decision to suspend construction on a controversial oil pipeline in #NorthDakota is a game changer for efforts to protect tribal lands, officials say.
342 2018-11-26 23:27:09 The best of a bad category is still bad. Make them better.

Can you give me a stat tracker for that 99.9%?

I'm not saying pipelines aren't our best option for oil but they need to be better, especially if they're going through our lakes and rivers.
343 2018-11-26 23:27:05 I’m pretty sure per head Norway pay more to EU than us ...... all that oil innit
344 2018-11-26 23:27:02 Thank you! You too!
345 2018-11-26 23:26:54 We bought a new oil heater. Well I thought we had, turns out it's a powerful electromagnet and both of our little sh...darlings have been eating metal.
346 2018-11-26 23:26:42 And in the next 25-30 yrs 250,000 ppl Willkie due to climate change, & that’s a fact!   The reason 45’s acting like an ass is bc he deleted Obama’s CC policy which gave his friends free reign to dump contaminated water into our lakes, plastics in our ocean, fumes in the air, oil
347 2018-11-26 23:26:35 いいね、お披露目楽しみにしとるでな〜
348 2018-11-26 23:26:20 THE INCONGRUITY!!! Alarming! HOW AUDACIOUS diba, to put fluffy breakfast food and motor oil (what’s this for? i dont even know) together in one frame (and dish)
349 2018-11-26 23:26:16 CBD Oil - K Guzman Thank you for following me!!
350 2018-11-26 23:26:15 someone buy me fur oil I wanna try it
351 2018-11-26 23:26:09 How much
352 2018-11-26 23:26:09 what’s worse than heartbreak?

motor oil.

354 2018-11-26 23:26:02 That was what I was wondering. I know CBD oil helps with seizures. Heck, I think it helps with so much.
355 2018-11-26 23:26:00 So do you only use sustainable palm oil? If not what is the timeframe in which you will be?
356 2018-11-26 23:25:51 True, except "collapsing oil prices" was only the beginning. Notley and Trudeau non energy policies were the real cause of the total collapse.
357 2018-11-26 23:25:49 my skin dries out easily, so I use nivea gentle cleansing cream for dry skin daily, clinique moisture surge daily, charcoal+almond face masks weekly, and tea tree oil on problem spots as needed. leaves my skin so soft and helped with oiliness.
358 2018-11-26 23:25:46 How the hell you gonna work to pass meaningful legislation with this “strong on the border” crap and pass real immigration law.  Like oil and water. Your talking out both sides Lindsey. There was a time you were legitimate
359 2018-11-26 23:25:34 I don’t understand the whole palm oil Iceland thing. They literally have frozen animals in their freezers.
360 2018-11-26 23:25:28 Edges crispy?? Like they use oil instead of butter?  Count me in!!
361 2018-11-26 23:25:26 ありラジラです( ^ω^ )
362 2018-11-26 23:25:26 I do have family from st Mary and such. We're supposed to be meeting with them asap to discuss a bulk deal. Maybe they supply the oil/potion and I make it directly into a candle
363 2018-11-26 23:25:25 Instead of using your therapy, cooking,language and mechanical skills else where, you decided to use it on someone else’s daughter. God is watching ooo. Your cane is soaked in crude oil.
364 2018-11-26 23:25:17 That’s BS.  Trump doesn’t even read... or believe in facts.  There are tecordings.  The intelligence assets from around the world have heard them.  He’s just not going to do anything because he doesn’t think a reporter’s life is important.  He’s in it for the oil and $$$.
365 2018-11-26 23:25:08 I done forgot it was time for a oil change 
366 2018-11-26 23:24:57 I hope so, it's hip op number 10, in 8 years
367 2018-11-26 23:24:56 There's no Alberta oil money this time, without the ability to sell our products we're sending less and less cash east.
368 2018-11-26 23:24:49 @WhiteHouse @DNC @GOP @ENERGY @NancyPelosi @senatemajldr 1)IMO @POTUS must know by now that many US+EU Companies working on Electric Tech in US are moving to China-Asia,they worry Trump Adm.will stab them in back. US will use Oil+Gas+Coal+Nuclear for years,we all can agree on it
369 2018-11-26 23:24:47 y’all ever felt someone and they just.. felt rough like ew can you put some oil on.
370 2018-11-26 23:24:44 If cocaine smelled like eucalyptus oil then maybe be id see what all the hype is about
371 2018-11-26 23:24:41 Thanks for watching. Unfortunately I can’t give personal dietary advice. However, if it was me and it was the only krill oil available I personally would take it and would try and get 4 grams per day (again this is not a recommendation).
372 2018-11-26 23:24:39 Canada is going to shit under this liberal government. Carbon tax, Alberta is getting screwed because of pipelines and oil prices and now Ontario is losing a major manufacturing plant. What next? Maple syrup crash? @JustinTrudeau, whatcha gonna do? #abpoli #cdnpoli #gm
373 2018-11-26 23:24:36 You imagine this will help some cause in some way? Abusing journalists who accurately report an undisputed reality? Do you imagine the SNP thinks there are secret oil fields? How did you think these fields were kept secret while being reported upon? Don't bother answering.
374 2018-11-26 23:24:33 I am comparing a small city to Alberta.  Sucks for all Canadians in my opinion on both subjects but why r we surprised.  GM is restructuring out of Canada.  Why would they stay just like oil this is not a business friendly country anymore.Taxes and regulations just getting worse.
375 2018-11-26 23:24:29 I guess in addition to phasing out the oil sands that make gasoline we're also going to phase out the auto manufacturing that makes the cars that burn the gas. Can we export unicorn farts and rainbows? #pmnitwit
376 2018-11-26 23:24:25 @maxkellerman cant take you seriously. You talk like a snake oil salesman with a girlish giggle like you know more than everyone else. You come across as intelectual elitist...oh wait you are. Are you & @getnickwright related? Talk alike. Styles same...both talks alot say nada 
377 2018-11-26 23:24:17 That's the hard part. At this point the rest of the country needs to work AROUND Alberta. We've invested too far in oil to rip it off like a band-aid but we shouldn't keep rubbing dirt in the wound.

We have an amazing opportunity for rare mineral mining but that will take time.
378 2018-11-26 23:23:58 Yep motor oil
379 2018-11-26 23:23:58 Oil needs to die? Wow. Had it not been for oil Canada would not be what it is today. What an ignorant comment.
380 2018-11-26 23:23:53 You're flimflamming as usual. Which corrupt oil deal? I guess the Malabu Oil deal. Well, per adventure you do not know, it was concluded in 1998, before #PDP existed. Google will gladly lead you to all materials regarding the legal fights on this deal. Happy Researching 
381 2018-11-26 23:23:52 Maybe he read the NYT report that deforestation to plant palm oil trees causes MORE carbon destruction than all the cars planes and trucks in US
382 2018-11-26 23:23:42 Remember the 13" Mini wheels? The engine  of that Mini was mounted sideways so the air was sucked in from the wheel well. Needless to say, it tended to overheat. To change the oil filter, I had to remove the grill. It was a blast to drive, though.
383 2018-11-26 23:23:41 Millionaires Trudeau/Butts/Morneau are out to kill our oil rich natural resource and Trudeau let that slip. No executive in their right mind would recommend investing in Canada as long as these three are pulling the strings.
384 2018-11-26 23:23:34 Unless they are Saudis and are willing to drop the price of oil by a few cents, right?
385 2018-11-26 23:23:31 How much money have you taken from big oil? George HW Bush back in the day was for government to curtail global warming. What happened? Oh, Senators like you capitulating to Big Oil. #YouSoldUsOut #GlobalWarmingKills
386 2018-11-26 23:23:26 Indépendant ? You mean paid by Saudi $$ :) You are paid to sponsor a tweet which is aimed to put pressure on Trump waivers on Iranian oil import to several countries .
387 2018-11-26 23:23:23 ...same trend is now happening in Alberta's oil patch...how to save a declining industry, providing decent pay for blue collar workers and how to create a new economy....
388 2018-11-26 23:23:22 Ewo tun ni butts and boobs oil ?
389 2018-11-26 23:23:20 We don't need Saudi Arabia's oil
390 2018-11-26 23:23:08 This is so good. All my nct group had non textbook deliveries (are there any?) and we all felt woefully gipped at the lack of real information provided by the classes. I was made to feel like my 2nd degree tear was a direct result of not massaging fucking coconut oil on my muff.
391 2018-11-26 23:23:08 The zinc and vitamin C did. I dont have access to black seed oil rn lol.
392 2018-11-26 23:23:02 Clove oil can be toxic to doggies!
393 2018-11-26 23:22:51 Bullish on oil for 2019. Good time to buy it. Thoughts?
394 2018-11-26 23:22:46 Gas is 3x what it was under President Obama. Oil magnates making 100s of billions in profits while everyone else suffers. Interest rates rising. Wages stagnant. #TradeWars causing millions to OWE taxes for the first time as 1% pay NOTHING. #Tariffs killing U.S  businesses.
395 2018-11-26 23:22:37 Ya that's a stretch but #dofo does take credit for the falling global price of oil....
396 2018-11-26 23:22:36 I guess if you have billions price of gas doesn’t bother you. What does a driver care What a barrel of oil cost coming out of the ground it is what we pay at the pump that matters.
397 2018-11-26 23:22:35 @BrianMonzon The parable of the 10 Virgins. 

Please give your opinion of the oil.

1. It could be purchased.
2. What is it?
3. What “payment” is extracted?
4. How do we insure we have enough?
398 2018-11-26 23:22:19 Bev Thompson never came close to damn near breaking  down over the oil sector lay offs but honestly, I thought the bitch was going to cry on tv this morning over the GM issue!!
399 2018-11-26 23:22:18 To hell with $110 billion, let's get $500 billion in premium oil for a trade! That would be a sweet deal.
400 2018-11-26 23:22:07 Correct, don't expect the dumb dumbs running the province to understand that. Also every region has different fuel and petroleum requirements. Much more efficient to ship oil to regional refiners.
401 2018-11-26 23:22:03 Oil profiteers must pay.
402 2018-11-26 23:21:52 On a much smaller scale, Alberta has lost 50,000 oil patch jobs!
403 2018-11-26 23:21:50 Wrong? Good God. I know we live in times when Trumpist disrespect for reality is the norm. But surely we can all agree that an oil field covered widely in the news for many years is not secret? Or have we lost our ability to tell real from obvious fake?
404 2018-11-26 23:21:50 by “market-driven” I hope that you are going to support a carbon tax.  It would also be nice to see you take away subsidies from oil and gas companies.  That’s probably asking too much of you.
405 2018-11-26 23:21:49 Oh no.... my car tells me when my tires need air so I fill them up but idk how to check the oil 
406 2018-11-26 23:21:46 Fund managers are complaining? Poor them, more corporate welfare is the answer, I'm sure. Collapsing oil prices have nothing to do with energy companies pulling out of the oil sands.
407 2018-11-26 23:21:38 Most Americans don't buy oil by the barrel. At this point it's still $2.50 or more a gallon. You have likely never pumped gas into a car. The same guy who thought you needed picture ID to buy Apple Jacks.
408 2018-11-26 23:21:29 Oh blimey!! I hope that goes very well for you and you'll be up and dancing on the tables by the end of the night! lol xx
409 2018-11-26 23:21:27 Watching TV and seeing @IcelandFoods adverts with the cute, and amazing, logo stating ‘no palm oil’ on their products 
410 2018-11-26 23:21:26 A section of American Experience’s “The Rockefellers” on Ida Tarbell and the Standard Oil antitrust trial. Elements of PBS’s “Triumph of the Nerds: A History of Computers.” Eichenwald’s “The Informant” has been covered in film, video, and radio - including This American Life.
411 2018-11-26 23:21:13 alberta is one of the dumbest richest places i’ve ever heard of. we should have prepared for the fall of oil years ago how could we be so stupid to think this could sustain us forever
412 2018-11-26 23:21:12 Does anyone else find it odd that the masseur will step out of the room so you can take off your robe and get under the covers just to step back into the room to start rubbing oil on your naked body?
413 2018-11-26 23:21:02 one of the hardest things about becoming an adult and working full time is taking care of things in your life beyond work. like i have at least 3 different doctors appointments i need to make, replace my tires, get an oil change, buy groceries on top of working 50 hrs a week
414 2018-11-26 23:20:45  People are stupid
415 2018-11-26 23:20:40 I ate some Annabelle oil and spent yesterday and today DEAD asleep. 
416 2018-11-26 23:20:28 im a trained oil analyst and am commended by regulators for exposing AIM fraud, #FRR shares are down 99% since IPO - what qualifications do you have to comment on stocks mr moron?
417 2018-11-26 23:20:19 Actually we do.  3 to be exact.  An oil and gas operating company, a hotshot trucking and roustabout company and and oilfield equipment company.  NEXT!
418 2018-11-26 23:19:51 Honesty I’m surprised that doesn’t always happen snake oil salesmen have existed for a long time.
419 2018-11-26 23:19:41 I’m not a mechanic but all #MAGAts should use honey in place of oil in their #pickup #Truck engines
420 2018-11-26 23:19:41 Dear @realDonaldTrump the lowering oil prices have nathing to do with you not the Saudis you LIAR, majority of USA oil comes from Canada most of what affecting the prices have to do with the Iran sanctions with the 8 exemption #moron.
421 2018-11-26 23:19:37 You are clueless
422 2018-11-26 23:19:37 Olive oil hasn't been used in the production of catgut for over a century. (E8 Fromage)
423 2018-11-26 23:19:33 italian catholics are baptized in olive oil and garlic
424 2018-11-26 23:19:29 But for future reference oil tell you something a friend would know
425 2018-11-26 23:19:28 I think I have met that guy before at a sci-fi convention. We sank a few pints of oil the night before...
426 2018-11-26 23:19:26 vitamin e oil or coconut oil or aloe vera
427 2018-11-26 23:19:26 Not sure really. It's by the oil refinery. There's a bunch of explosions happening, this is nuts.
428 2018-11-26 23:19:25 Rex Murphy is paid by big oil and gas. Respect is earned not bestowed on someone who has a dog in the fight. And I don't oppose pipelines or oil sands.
429 2018-11-26 23:19:16 El cambio d mando es el día d 1000x1000 en Carnicerias o Planadas - Huila (oil A), al contrario, lo más baratillo es comprar la fabrica d lino, papel billete, lo más caro sin tilde solmodia, lo maravilloso es no poder expulsar a los jesuitas del Cristianismo.
430 2018-11-26 23:19:12 石油だってオリーブオイルだって牛脂だって仲間さ、そうだろう?
431 2018-11-26 23:19:08 Real curious to see what Cleveland can fetch for Corey Kluber on a deal for three years at an average of $15.5M per? One would have to think it would be rather substantial #MLB
432 2018-11-26 23:19:07 I quiver at the thought of Scummo drenching himself in baby oil, putting on some Barry White, and doing the truffle shuffle at the foot of Bill Shorten’s bed.
433 2018-11-26 23:19:05 my one ANNIHILATION take at this late point is that it would be nice if someone backed up an oil tanker full of cash to Paramount and said "hey we found the rest of the box office money now make the other two movies, please, motherfuckers, NOW"
434 2018-11-26 23:19:02 If you are so concerned about the #Iranian people, arsehole, why are you trying to choke off the oil export revenue that is needed to import vital goods for #Iranians. You're hardly an intelligent person, but at times you seem real dumb.
435 2018-11-26 23:19:00 “Booming U.S. oil production is wreaking havoc on the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries’ (OPEC) influence of the international market.”
436 2018-11-26 23:18:40 Getting Cbd oil has been the best thing ive done for myself lately.
437 2018-11-26 23:18:24 What’s the drop on CBD oil for anxiety? Anybody use it before?
438 2018-11-26 23:18:13 Exactly. I was going to say something along these lines. trump is a total idiot completely bought and paid for by Russia and the big oil and fracking industries.
439 2018-11-26 23:18:10 I think Nuclear and responsible hydro electric are our best bet moving forward with oil only being used for production of reusable/not-one-use plastics. 

And carbon taxation on corporations with no bail outs for anyone but citizens. Cap and Trade sort of stuff with an exit plan.
440 2018-11-26 23:18:04 Hey @DevinNunes!  How does @realDonaldTrump’s cock taste this week? Extra sooty? Greasy like motor oil? You know the cost of what you’re doing is your soul and a record in history as one of the guys who ushered in the destruction of our planet (the economy goes with that BTW).
441 2018-11-26 23:18:01 That's what oil is for.
442 2018-11-26 23:17:38 Gotta secure the cert to secure the bag. Oil/chem  – bij Compass Maritime Training Center
443 2018-11-26 23:17:38 So one vote for $150/barrel oil? Because you love Russia or Saudis?
444 2018-11-26 23:17:36 Incidentally. . . *what* credit for oil prices? Gasoline prices at the pump are higher than I've seen them in years, which Trump would know if he ever did any driving. Or looking. Or reading. Or listening. Or anything.
445 2018-11-26 23:17:23 I’m not sure specifically what you’re referring to. But whenever a report comes out they always fake care for a couple of weeks before it’s right back to status quo denying it while taking money from big oil
446 2018-11-26 23:17:08 Right? There’s such an amazing amount of money given to basic researchers and assistants, it’s a wonder more people aren’t giving up their big pharma and big oil lobbying jobs for it
447 2018-11-26 23:17:00 What the Hell, Canada caters to much to certain groups..Move the oil Mr Trudeau, Be Bold, Mr Trump would not put up this shit
448 2018-11-26 23:16:55 Whisk egg yolk with a tablespoon of olive oil and leave on hair for a few minutes before your shampoo. It makes a great hair conditioner.
449 2018-11-26 23:16:50 Haven’t found a single thing to buy on Black Friday or Cyber Monday except for some oil stocks that were 40% off.
450 2018-11-26 23:16:46 Relieved your hardline stance on coco oil might be softening.
451 2018-11-26 23:16:45 I LOVE mustard greens.
I usually steam kale and throw some olive oil and parmesan on it. Not much, just enough.
452 2018-11-26 23:16:34 I don’t want to I’ve needed an oil change for a good while I’m scared..
453 2018-11-26 23:16:17 If left to the 3rd world it would all still be in the ground and no value to anyone including the 3rd world. That's the problem with the 3rd world Same as middle East if left to the indigenous people oil would still be in the ground and it would be 3rd wprld like Africa with sand
454 2018-11-26 23:16:16 I enjoy mine without palm oil.
455 2018-11-26 23:16:16 Any help coming for the 50,000 Alberta oil patch workers, whose lives you have basically destroyed???
456 2018-11-26 23:16:13 Yes #gmoshawa closing is terrible BUT didn't you see this coming? Cars, petroleum powered cars are an old paradigm that if not for greed, big oil, lobbyist & crooked politics, technically should've been obsolete 10+ years ago. #onpoli #cdnpoli

458 2018-11-26 23:16:05 And yet for the sake of arms deals and oil money Trump is willing to look the other way, essentially consenting to murder. He is culpable.
459 2018-11-26 23:15:49 it's so stupid easy girl. all ya need is weed, coconut oil, a stove or crock pot and a pair of pantyhose or a cheesecloth.
460 2018-11-26 23:15:43 Trudeau is a a middle eastern oil salesperson ,,,,,,and robbing us in front of your eyes
461 2018-11-26 23:15:41 They are using sex to burn fat and oil
462 2018-11-26 23:15:33 It’s motor oil that’s why
463 2018-11-26 23:15:26 Use electricity and slippery oil on the border.... and reinforce those weak points. #BorderShutdown #protecttheborder #border #stopthesorosinvasion #StopTheInvasion #StopTheCaravan
464 2018-11-26 23:15:20 Ah yes, as opposed to the obvious expert and unbiased oil lobbyists who get paid to tell outright lies to preserve their industry cash flow.
465 2018-11-26 23:15:19 The Dominican in me tried putting Vick’s in my essential oil diffuser & I’m sad to say it didn’t work
466 2018-11-26 23:15:02 No subtweet. And no truffle oil is not awesome! C’mon Chris!
467 2018-11-26 23:14:55 @kathrynfreed we used the Fairy Tale shampoo today (preventive measures and all) and hubs goes,

“Oh man, she smells like adorable focaccia bread”  

How about that rosemary oil

469 2018-11-26 23:14:47 It depends on the cultivar! Some are categorized as tree and some as bush! Most just say tea plant. But to back up my claim: tea tree oil.
470 2018-11-26 23:14:41 The value of our oil is going down every day though, tar sand oils are probably the worst quality oils people can process.

I understand the concerns about short term revenue relief, but this is only going to get worse if we keep going down this road.

We have no long term plan.
471 2018-11-26 23:14:33 Oil Prices Bounce Back, GBP up as EU Approves Brexit Deal - US Market Open
472 2018-11-26 23:14:32 C) I would struggle to pass myself a banana behind my back because my level of flexibility is on a par with the tin Man before he got his oil.
473 2018-11-26 23:14:25 Work truck, driven daily, some dings but overall good truck. Needs tuneup and oil  change. Cash only. No Trades!
474 2018-11-26 23:14:03 Lapangan futsal Pati Unus ya.
475 2018-11-26 23:13:55 I felt the same way in 2008 when the car companies got restructured and government aid. They didn’t learn the lesson. I know those big trucks sell well still...but they can’t be the future because of the reality of where climate and peak oil are going.
476 2018-11-26 23:13:42 Palmer’s Cocoa Butter Formula lotion is way better than the Coconut Oil lotion

481 2018-11-26 23:13:21 You have eliminated the natural advantages we had in winning industries like oil/gas by placing made in Canada barriers to kill them & you throw money at natural losers (auto & aerospace) where there are only challenges ahead.

484 2018-11-26 23:13:09 Nope. Hes all talk. He is against Alberta having and power.  There is an interview with him and he is just talks about Quebec and is very anti Alberta and oil.  Fool.
485 2018-11-26 23:13:06 Lots of oil water and love
486 2018-11-26 23:13:03 I tried 60secs cleansing oil, felt smooth gile. Taktaulah sbb brand of cleansing oil ke ape
487 2018-11-26 23:12:57 He thinks government needs to do more to protect auto sector jobs (cars produce emissions) but thinks the government should not do more to protect oil and gas jobs (which produce emissions). 

He thinks auto workers should keep their jobs, but oil and gas should not.
488 2018-11-26 23:12:53 I mean yeah that’s true, but it will also probably destroy the necessary ports for trade and most likely displace millions.
But yeah keep trading that oil!
489 2018-11-26 23:12:48 i need my car washed, vacuumed, my oil changed, everything bro 
490 2018-11-26 23:12:45 That picture from earlier. With the motor oil lmaooo

According to Bloomberg, oil production in Saudi Arabia increased again, setting a new record. Now, the kingdom produces 11.2 million barrels per day
493 2018-11-26 23:12:32 Not me HilgaBeast, see we can agree on some things. Tbh though I think we should have stayed there and occupied those oil fields.
494 2018-11-26 23:12:28 แต่ชินจังนะ
495 2018-11-26 23:12:25 It's worth checking the breakeven costs for US shale... WTI has dropped to nearly $50. Oil prices can be too low just as they can be too high.

504 2018-11-26 23:11:27 Some people think CBD Oil works to reduce cancer tumours
If women with cervical cancer promote the HPV vaccine will they be given an expensive cancer drug free that might save their life
505 2018-11-26 23:11:26 Did Trump and MBS collude to drop oil prices a month before the election to “juice” the economy to effect voters?
506 2018-11-26 23:11:18 @SNPChris You were spot on calling out Leask for his article Chris. Was the public made aware that the largest oil field discovered in Europe would be coming online 2 years into a freshly independent Scotland? Absolutely they were not informed, and folk who did were mocked 1/2
507 2018-11-26 23:11:13 Still is. Paid £20k per month for advising oil company he flogged.
508 2018-11-26 23:11:11 I wish we had vast oil reserves like norway...
509 2018-11-26 23:11:09 The Cafe Mac Pizza for dinner today will be: no crust with sad coconut oil and shrimp.
510 2018-11-26 23:11:01 Pro tip: When making brownies substitute vegetable oil for coconut oil! It’s so much sweeter and smoother and it’ll never crack
511 2018-11-26 23:10:55 Don’t say any ball shit until you have evidence because no one as an adult sane person will believe you with out evidence in his hand you have to respect Saudi government which make peace in the world by reduced the oil prices you will pay less tax because of MBS ”say thanks”
512 2018-11-26 23:10:52 Don't forget that if CNY oil & gold are both up & running, then PBOC can control int'l trade value of USD as it sees fit over time.
513 2018-11-26 23:10:48 i just came to get my oil changed and i have the WORST anxiety
514 2018-11-26 23:10:44 Gotta love how every time you take a car in for something basic, you leave paying way more than you thought. What should have been a $50 oil change and tire rotation is now costing $280
515 2018-11-26 23:10:44 Just help Saudi to kill journalist and oil price will decrease!...
516 2018-11-26 23:10:35 Getting my oil change always makes me so nervous. They always just say stuff AT me because I know that they know I’m an idiot when it comes to cars.
517 2018-11-26 23:10:28 Anyone interested in a discount group order for HempWorx CBD oil message me. 3 spots open- choose peppermint, cinnamon, or original flavor 500 mg OR 750 mg. 
518 2018-11-26 23:10:28 Yeah I like the fit for Donaldson. I just don’t think he was worth 23 million but who knows 
519 2018-11-26 23:10:20 Coconut oil and lavender oil! It works wonders
520 2018-11-26 23:10:19 CBD Oil has helped me so much. God bless mother nature

524 2018-11-26 23:09:54 Yes we are still not legalized in pa but I have found the cbd oil helpful for anxiety.. could get it thru Amazon
525 2018-11-26 23:09:54 Ask @Big_Orrin . U.S. needs blending stock but not sure that 25-30 API balances 40-50 API LTO well enough. Much of the GOM oil we're exporting is 25-30 API sour. Go figure.
526 2018-11-26 23:09:53 Me: Careful of that strange oil!
You: It's probably nothing.
527 2018-11-26 23:09:50 Why the fuck is everyone so effing  concerned over this auto deal- no one is concerned about the oil going down the toilet and that should concern all Canada
528 2018-11-26 23:09:48 by the way, Panaway oil is just the thing for after workouts #youngliving
529 2018-11-26 23:09:46 Searching for oil

Deal is done.  Note Rockwell approval. Us Navy in Hong Kong. N Korea soldiers buds with s Korean 

China buys soybeans and oil from US

Trump postpones Jan tariffs 

Fed pauses.  Dollar down allows China to cut RRR 

Play it like feb 16
531 2018-11-26 23:09:28 Dinosaur @realDonaldTrump

532 2018-11-26 23:09:28 Well we don’t want that evil witch thatcher on our money the untold suffering that woman caused she should have been charged with crimes against humanity and stole North Sea oil revenues
533 2018-11-26 23:09:26 We have to reduce our emissions by 45% by 2030.  How on earth is TMX going to fit into that carbon budget?  Who is going to have to cut more to allow for oil sands increases??
534 2018-11-26 23:09:09 Panibagong oil price rollback, inaasahan sa susunod na linggo #PangunahingBalita #DZRHNationwide @doe_ph
535 2018-11-26 23:08:54 True. Just need to pop back 20 or 30 years and start our own oil fund.
536 2018-11-26 23:08:51 Or there’s a bottleneck of supply caused by federal mismanagement which forces the country with the 3rd largest oil reserves on the planet to buy oil from a bunch of tyrants instead of just refining its own so Canadian dollars don’t fund beheadings of human rights advocates
537 2018-11-26 23:08:49 Gmit ka ng grapeseed oil..mukhang TUYONG KAHOY ka na eh. 
538 2018-11-26 23:08:47 Their government keeps the price artificially low. High oil prices are a deeply unpopular.
539 2018-11-26 23:08:37 How's gold and oil Peter?? Don't you think it's dangerous to involve your emotions in analysis of markets? It's plainly obvious you are getting caught up in a team mentality and ironically you are taking the side of government now! Is that just your form of coping?
540 2018-11-26 23:08:35 @realDonaldTrump What takes about 5 minutes to figure out about who you are is that you are a narcisstic, psychopathic compulsive liar.  Even your CEO pals in oil industry know that climate change is real, you absolutely stupid M-----F-----.

542 2018-11-26 23:08:21 One of these industries where we had a competitive advantage (eg oil & has) this village idiot takes the advantage away and then gives support to those where we have disadvantage (autos and aerospace). Just brilliant.
543 2018-11-26 23:08:21 We need to produce oil until we get rid of fossil fuel cars.
1 in 300 cars in the road today are electric. 
This issue is the auto makers like GM not the suppliers of fuel.

544 2018-11-26 23:08:19 U.S. oil continued to drop over the holiday and suffered a 7.7% drop on Black Friday, which is the largest 1 day drop in 3 years. #SUACCF18

546 2018-11-26 23:08:00 I sell organic oil for hair/skin care and black soap suitable for all skin types at very affordable prices pls RT and patronize thanks...
547 2018-11-26 23:07:50 And when Big Ag (or Big Oil) dictates research and/or policy, you can bet it won't be a REAL climate solution.
548 2018-11-26 23:07:46 Oil bribes - oil companies have had all this planned out for years! just like they have known about climate change since the 50’s - it’s all over fossil fuel money!!!!
549 2018-11-26 23:07:42 A kid in my sons class was peeing in the oil diffuser in his room.  I’ll leave the rest to your imagination.

551 2018-11-26 23:07:36 If that's the case, IMO, the Donaldson signing looks even better. See if they can find Camargo a permanent home or homes and let Josh keep the seat warm for the kid until 2020.

553 2018-11-26 23:07:14 Is olive oil fruit juice?
554 2018-11-26 23:06:57 Hi there. We use RSPO certified sustainable palm fruit oil from a segregated supply chain in all Nairn’s products.
555 2018-11-26 23:06:55 I proudly note that I taught both daughter and son to sew, cook meals, change car oil and tires, household repairs and light construction.

561 2018-11-26 23:06:26 Oil companies have been working together since WW2 - back then Koch brothers and other oil companies were under the name Standard oil and they actually sold oil to hitler while hitler was bombing and killing americans’ - its always OIL

565 2018-11-26 23:05:57 Tens of thousands out of work! Selling Canada’s future to the states at a deep discount. Canadian oil. Where’s the solution ?
566 2018-11-26 23:05:39 What kind of flu? For stomach flu - drink pure grape juice, the good, 100% Concord grape juice. Cold flu - eat TONS of raw garlic. Take oregano oil w/ water. Do a mixture of BioK acidophilus, echinacea goldenseal drops, & black elderberry syrup (all from Whole Foods) 3x per day.
567 2018-11-26 23:05:37 MLB pipeline says 2019 and he is only 21 so I could see him coming up around August or September and going into 2020 as the starting 3rd basemen
568 2018-11-26 23:05:37 Needs to mention the part where we're SELLING our coal, gas & oil abroad, rather than using them here.
Notice his word choice.
We could already have "energy independence" if we chose it -- could have had since 2011.
It is a CHOICE that we do not (tho we're close, at 86-92%).
569 2018-11-26 23:05:30 I've seen 3 quarter centuries. Yes, oil will be around but less for fuel and more for chemicals it contains, so don't impede development of new alternative fuel sources. I've seen climate change and went to school with war and famine refugees.  Thanks for the civil discussion.
570 2018-11-26 23:05:26 Big s/o to my baby brother, he’s out there doing my oil change and changing my brakes for me. A WHOLE MAN. And he’s only 18. 
571 2018-11-26 23:05:13 It’s all about OIL , OIL , OIL , OIL
572 2018-11-26 23:05:07 I dunno.  He seems to be able to order sovereign countries to stop buying oil from Iran pretty much on a whim.
573 2018-11-26 23:05:03 California draws from the population, economic, and resource pool of the entire United States. And it has far more people than the countries you listed.

US GDP per capita is only 16% higher than Sweden's, and Sweden doesn't have oil. Norway's GDP per capita is way above the US.
574 2018-11-26 23:04:58 Koch brothers and Russian oil companies are the same thing
575 2018-11-26 23:04:46 Look, its definitely oil but for toast
576 2018-11-26 23:04:30 @JustinTrudeau Do you not think it's time to build a refinery near the oil sands , rather than a pipeline. If we can sell a finished product, we benefit. Trumps protections, are going to hurt Canadians a lot more than the GM closing in the future.  Regards Garry Boychyn
577 2018-11-26 23:04:27 Turns out Sentinel has oil pockets and we're sending the army to retrieve that guys body
578 2018-11-26 23:04:23 For anyone that doesn’t understand how bad the oil situation is. Sold my oil in November, I am suppose to get paid for it on dec 25, going to have a bill instead of a cheque to pick up on December 25.  Who cares out east.  No one.

581 2018-11-26 23:03:43 There will always be intellectual hucksters and there will always be people who deliberately buy their snake oil. 

At the same time, there are people truly curious about history and want facts. If we don't provide facts, those folks will end up lost and falling to the hucksters.
582 2018-11-26 23:03:43 Me puse mi cremita de Cannabis oil y ahora no siento la pierna 
583 2018-11-26 23:03:42 None of our oil pipelines get held to the proper standard of quality. They always go for 'minimum acceptable', which is why they always leak.
584 2018-11-26 23:03:39 GM & Ford are both going to stop making sedans. 
Sedan sales are slow right now due to Americans’ love of crossovers.

Surveys show millennials like sedans.

GM and Ford are going to get caught with their pants down again the next time oil prices spike.

588 2018-11-26 23:03:18 Dedicating political capital to cutting supply wd make sense if our camp had infinite amount of political capital. It doesn't. It couldn't even cut off oil production in Los Angeles via setbacks. The progressive climate action alliance is less monolithic than some like to think.
589 2018-11-26 23:03:17 We've all seen that video on insta and now everyone's just shouting 'motor oil' at every food pic
590 2018-11-26 23:03:02 Brought an air fryer two months ago. I love it. I never fry anything and I missed eating fry chicken. Now, I make fry chicken wings that taste better than Buffalo Wild Wings, without having to feel guilty. One tablespoon of oil is all I use to coat the chicken.

599 2018-11-26 23:02:22 First Trump is not all that intelligent; second he’s probably getting money from big coal & oil industries
600 2018-11-26 23:02:19 Sure, let Congress act. That way, when the World oil crisis hits, we can blame Congress. But we both know Congress are cowards and will never act.
601 2018-11-26 23:02:14 “I’m not a scientist, and I am really a shareholder/lobbyist for big oil, coal, and biofuels, but I think climate change is just a hoax” - that’s The Liars Club motto.

607 2018-11-26 23:01:26 Kill the oil,
Kill the vehicles that use oil,
There is an agenda.
But what?
Am I just overthinking there has to be an agenda?
Or a bigger one than both combined?
608 2018-11-26 23:01:20 None, I used a lil olive oil spray and that’s it
609 2018-11-26 23:01:13 So I personally know environmental scientists and oil lobbyists.  My coursework is predominantly demography as it is related to environmental justice and racism.  

I am curious what big payoffs environmental scientists are getting that would cause them to be biased?
610 2018-11-26 23:01:13 Glad to see you agree that over 4 decades the transfer has been southwards. Now, of course, that's based on oil but where has that money gone- don't you think that there should've been less of a concentration on London and se England?

622 2018-11-26 23:00:32 Aaaaaa while in general I agree about  80% of soy in the world is used for oil and meat production 
So basically by going vegetarian we could reduce the amount of soy needed to feed humans

Not that there aren‘t other issues but animals eat more soy than we do
623 2018-11-26 23:00:31 He  promotes superficial reforms and increases oil production while quietly practicing old school savagery!
624 2018-11-26 23:00:23 I feel like I’ll go mad when I hear people who understand the dire prognosis on climate change that still(in that compartmentalized way)think we can carry on the same with oil and gas, or worse, get oilier and gassier.
625 2018-11-26 23:00:11 I don’t have an air fryer either. When I want fried food, I want FRIED FOOD (read: oil in a pan)!

633 2018-11-26 22:59:27 don't heard that in France. The "Yellow Shirts" are just against our president and desmontrating that with the over-tax on oil argument.

636 2018-11-26 22:59:21 Don't you think politicians who have interests or shares in arms companies or oil companies or "security" companies taking middle east rebuilding contracts,  should declare a conflict of interest and step down for the safety of UK residents?

638 2018-11-26 22:59:11 @JustinTrudeau is a guy who couldn't explain a doorknob but he tells seasoned AB oil executives that the industry is complex and possibly above their level of understanding.

646 2018-11-26 22:58:04 What is the hit, and how is that hit compared to the long term monetary impacts of not addressing increasing CO2 levels?
Or is the prevailing attitude, “I don’t care what future generations must deal with, I gotta get mine!” ? I ask this about folks in oil specifically.
647 2018-11-26 22:57:57 Wow. Happened 15 years ago but palm oil is bad so we'll find a link to that and that Iceland advert, clickbaity

664 2018-11-26 22:56:29 I've never seen a true leader tout his perceived accomplishments like you. It is the sign of a small, petty man. Oil prices constantly move up and down. They have during your presidency as they did during previous ones. When they increased earlier this year, did you take credit?

673 2018-11-26 22:55:36 Between September 2015 and June 2016, as a result of collapsing oil prices, Alberta lost 66,600 jobs. That is an average of 7,400 per month or, if you like, the equivalent of 2.96 GM plants every month.  Just sayin'

678 2018-11-26 22:55:26 Not to mention they took away access to about half of my sources on oil spill pollution I had bookmarked for my thesis (EPA website not updating archives either)
679 2018-11-26 22:55:11 Kraft peanut butter contained palm oil - does the bega version which is apparently the same, alsocontain palm oil ? Does anyone know ?
680 2018-11-26 22:55:09 But doesn’t know that 40% of oil comes from Canada and what 10% from saudis. What about this so called taxes scam which on paper favours the 1% and in the future will cost the middle class more.
681 2018-11-26 22:55:07 He’s a sleazy, sweaty snake oil salesman. 
682 2018-11-26 22:54:54 Art, like painting any medium can help you dig deep and release it in a healthy way. While playing wow i got back into chainmaille art and oil painting. 2.5 years later after all of it I'm better now than i ever thought i would be.

685 2018-11-26 22:54:33 First time getting oil in the college gaff, gets maced by some sound lads down the estate. Nice one
686 2018-11-26 22:54:25 No they didn't. They went and worked in those states. Now you are either just lying or completely misinformed.
687 2018-11-26 22:54:25 I heard teslas requires no oil change. As long as you can love with whompies, queues, random breakdowns
688 2018-11-26 22:54:20  it works
689 2018-11-26 22:54:18 We have a rainbow swamp near my home. Only difference is ours was created when Enbridge energy dumped a million gallons of oil in the Kalamazoo river. Now the swamps around it are all pretty rainbows. 
690 2018-11-26 22:54:17 So the question no one is asking about the dreadful Freeman vodafone ad. He's clearly binned the Scottish lassie that bought him an expensive phone last Christmas.   It's like England and Scotland's oil.
691 2018-11-26 22:54:16 LOL @ “self-made”. Only a white male could believe in that fairytale. He literally put the oil in the ground in Alberta and built the industry. What about the huge energy industry investments of this Lougheed fellow’s govt? Ah, that had nothing to do with it. All Brett.
692 2018-11-26 22:54:08 I’ll accept that your govt single handedly lowered the price for oil globally IF you snap a picture of the #GMClosing and #ForThePeople

697 2018-11-26 22:53:47 I agree with renewable investments, but the argument a lot of people have is getting the money to fund it or companies to sign on to do it.

Although I agree, expansion of oil seems to be moving in the wrong direction.

The only reason to expand is because our oil is shit quality

699 2018-11-26 22:53:39 And note too even amongst those scientists who debate climate change, ever wonder why nearly all work for oil lobbying groups? And ever wonder why you are believing the same proportion of scientists as doctors would tell you coffee enemas cure cancer?
700 2018-11-26 22:53:38 I had no idea the commercial hacks video about the motor oil and shaving cream had become worldwide famous like this 
701 2018-11-26 22:53:36 In case somebody doesn't think petroleum is important please Google it and see what all we get from crude oil. It runs this country and it runs the world. Anybody remember a hurricane or natural disaster. Imagine that everyday. Gas lines. No
702 2018-11-26 22:53:35 drench my food in motor oil fuck it
703 2018-11-26 22:53:34 Oil that only makes @exxonmobil rich bc only 7% of that oil comes to US the rest is sold to China and  Europe
704 2018-11-26 22:53:27 Fat is an important part of people's diet. Oil is an important part of cooking techniques and cuisine the world over. Yes, you or I can not eat palm oil and we will be fine. It's quite high in saturated fats so it won't do any harm not eating it on the individual level.

714 2018-11-26 22:52:58 I agree Camargo is the likely long-term fit but adding a healthy Donaldson to the mix, on a 1-year deal, makes that lineup awfully intimating.

719 2018-11-26 22:52:47 How about @JustinTrudeau putting the same amount of effort to get oil & gas workers back to work in Alberta? Oh....wait....Alberta....can't do that, might need to build a pipeline.
720 2018-11-26 22:52:47 The gas and oil has 30 years before they need to make new plans.
721 2018-11-26 22:52:45 Climate change evidence is there for all to see now. Big fossil fuels & their investors have a tight grip on drumpf’s testicals. If he admits climate change the greedies who want coal, oil etc; will punish drumpf & install a new defender of the black poisonous, planet killer.

727 2018-11-26 22:52:07 short sighted decision by GM, small fuel efficient cars will be in high demand when, not if, oil prices shoot up, prob past $100/barrel, natural disaster, war, or just MidEast/Persian Gulf tensions, are just around the corner, tumbleweeds are gonna roll past those big Trucks/SUVs

730 2018-11-26 22:51:34 They try but market dictates what they can sell for and we only have one market we do have some oil hopping to the coast on rail and smaller pipelines but the capacity needs to triple or quadruple.

732 2018-11-26 22:51:32 Trudeau needs to back off with his carbon tax and build pipelines. Alberta needs to get the oil out of the ground - thru pipe lines - to refineries - and to the rest of the world. Trudeau is destroying this country and something needs to be done now.

738 2018-11-26 22:51:19 Its going just fine. The oil is moving and its turning a profit
739 2018-11-26 22:51:02 The issue is that this data corresponds with western industrialization. Fossil fuels. And let’s also remember the first people to recognize this phenomenon was oil companies...and they used the data to raise the average height of their oil derricks to offset sea level rise.

744 2018-11-26 22:50:35 Muellers investigation isn't focused on that, that would require its own separate investigation. Trump is the reason our economy is booming, hes making deals that help the American people, not just him personally. Oil prices for example, our gas is super cheap right now.
745 2018-11-26 22:50:33 current google: "can you buy olive oil at the gas station?"

747 2018-11-26 22:50:28 The liberal government has bailed Bombardier out up here at least 3 times. The last time all the bigwigs got raises and now they are laying a bunch of people off while at the same time intentionally destroying the oil and gas sector! 
748 2018-11-26 22:50:20 1.38 BILLION, didn't hire more workers, just cashed the cheque. This isn't your government working against you. It's world oil prices they have ZERO control over. We are a net producer, we have more than we could use. over supply...

So if the World needs the U$D to buy the oil and the USA became the largest producer with some forecasts to hit 13,5 billion bpd in 2020...

Can you see one reason to the U$D rising?

Your thesis doesn't add up

759 2018-11-26 22:49:47 Mathematical models just don't work for tiny price changes in oil markets that gyrate up/down for completely different reasons. A $20/barrel change can indeed be modeled - ie will have impact on output. A change of <40 cents (your model) has no impact in real-world oil production
760 2018-11-26 22:49:45 Put olive oil on your titties to make them happy and perky.
761 2018-11-26 22:49:39 What about climate change? Let's use real science electric cars, wind and solar power, smart electric grids. Do away with burning coal, oil and gas. We are in the 21st. century not the 19 th.

774 2018-11-26 22:48:58 Don't forget we get nearly half our oil from Canada and they aren't doing so hot in the trade sense. At least that's what I hear from my economics obsessed friend.
775 2018-11-26 22:48:53 to be clear a balanced expansion of trade should be close to neutral for jobs.  issue comes when deficit rises and higher imports aren't offset by more exports.  and for the US there has been an important sectoral shift toward oil and away from exports of manufactures.
776 2018-11-26 22:48:49 Brett is a little off kilter as of late. He wants to hang environmentalists. Might be more than oil glut angst.
777 2018-11-26 22:48:43 Fire hs existed well before mankind. Floods also. Climate hs changed always over time. Humans hv adapted naturally. The old will pull back when the new is firmly established. There can be no artificial vacuum in between hoping for the best. Jobs are a must. Oil=needed 4 long time

You'll have to just guide me in. 
793 2018-11-26 22:47:33 So... Tell me if this is wrong. If you own oil/car makers, couldn't you try to diversify and make electric cars and try to make more money? Wouldn't that work? You'd have more cars out there and people might look at you a bit better.

808 2018-11-26 22:45:49 Lord, we pray for the Q team and all intel who have witnessed unspeakable evil. We ask for your  power to heal every part in their minds and spirits that has been damaged as a result. Pour your oil on each one. Restore and heal their minds with peace and comfort in Jesus’ name.
809 2018-11-26 22:45:44 America is just an oil company with an army lol.

814 2018-11-26 22:45:31 Egg yolk and olive oil (for oily skin):
One egg yolk
One tablespoon of honey
One tablespoon of olive oil
Half a cup of oatmeal 

Mix it all together in a bowl and aplly on the skin. Let it dry for 15 to 20 minutes. Wash it of with warm water. Then hydrate as usual.
815 2018-11-26 22:45:26 Most of my supermarket shopping is done online.  It's easier.  But every two months or so I go to Aldi and do a BIG shop of stock cupboard ingredients.  Tins of tomatoes, beans and pulses, pasta, oil, that kind of thing.  I get LOADS.  The trolley's usually overflowing.

817 2018-11-26 22:45:21 Rex Murphy and Jason Kenny both receive substantial support from the oil industry.  

They they get paid by the taxpayers to promote the oil industry.  

Do you trust them to tell the truth?
818 2018-11-26 22:45:20 *When the oil money clears*
819 2018-11-26 22:45:16 Need to change oil this week.
820 2018-11-26 22:45:15 Regarding the GM shutdown in Oshawa. 
No pipelines for oil. 
No oil for cars. 
No cars.

821 2018-11-26 22:45:13 You can lead people to kale, quinoa, coconut oil, omega-3 oils  and avocados. . .but the food companies are getting them to eat deep fried, crispy, golden brown, over-cheesed, over-sauces junk food.
822 2018-11-26 22:44:53 Something tells me you sat silent as a mouse when Barack Obama did it under the exact same circumstances in 2013. He also used water hoses on Native Americans by the oil pipeline. Not a word from you tho, right? Hypocrite

826 2018-11-26 22:44:40 Honestly @thegrasschief is the BEST. Ordered 3 refills for my vape and got a weed cookie, THC infused lip chap AND a refill co2 honey oil buzzed extracts for free with my order. 
Thanks again guys! Forever ordering with you 
827 2018-11-26 22:44:40 Because it's confusing and he doesn't know how to make sound decisions. 
He's a know it all. And if he doesn't get a big enough kickback/bribe from it, like he does big oil and other fossil fuels, then he has no use for it.
No interest in truth or the consequences of his actions.
828 2018-11-26 22:44:40 Mission accomplished.
829 2018-11-26 22:44:33 Obviously you are young & don’t know shit. You forget Iran held 44 hostages for over a year, beheaded other Americans, owes us for building their oil wells in the day of the Shah, captured one of our Naval boats. Etc. Muslim Obama rewarded them bc he was chicken shit
830 2018-11-26 22:44:32 Good! Just make sure you’re getting good quality because that makes a huge difference! I like to tell people the greener the cleaner the oil. A lot of oils you can buy in stores are deluded unfortunately.
831 2018-11-26 22:44:26 Of course we will never k ow but my guess would be "uhh, oh, umm well, uhh hhmm, gee umm,err oh umm,well um,gee, well umm errg ahh well ya well umm so grr erm well as you k ow umm uhh oh ahh sniffle liplick throatgrunt umm, the price of oil per barrel is directly umm sniffle gru"

834 2018-11-26 22:44:16 If tech and oil bounce big, could hit $spx 2800 by EoD Friday
835 2018-11-26 22:44:11 3. The point is that analysis also exposes the extent to which maintaining our higher public spending if indy relied on oil (hence SNP's £6.8 - 7.9bn pa forecast in White Paper) - and that was clearly reckless (as I said at the time and has been shown to be the case)
836 2018-11-26 22:44:04 It will be Edinburgh or the north east still thinking they can catch a fish or get tax from oil

841 2018-11-26 22:43:13 The guy at the oil change place literately asked me for my groupon outside in the rain. Like buddy do you not have common sense?
842 2018-11-26 22:43:07 Simple answer, money.
He knows better he just puts greed before everything else including peoples health and safety.
It clear that he doesn't care about people or the environment. 
He just insures the money keeps rolling in for big oil and especially for his bankers, the Saudi's.
843 2018-11-26 22:43:07 So glad l could help boo, your skin the perfect canvas anyway  they have decent brushes, it might be the brow formula try setting them to soak up the excess oil first
844 2018-11-26 22:43:03 Or will the Kenney say it's all the fault of the communist NDP folks that we have to put in a PST? I'm guessing this is what he will have to do as the oil prices will remain in the toilet and interest charges alone in servicing the provincial debt will increase.
845 2018-11-26 22:42:58 You’re low-information propagandists without a speck of integrity!
The situation that we face with Saudi Arabia, has everything to do with the previous globalist’s ties to oil & the Bin Ladens. The Iraqi war, literally “killed the competition” to the Carlisle Group (Bush/BLaden)
846 2018-11-26 22:42:57 Cbd oil helps with anxiety and depression! You would start with the recommended dosage. But can adjust it to what you feelvworks best for you! For me I use it once a day. Also it helps with other things like it will help with sleep too!

Viva!
851 2018-11-26 22:42:30 Trudeau was elected on his last name only. Period. The guy is not intelligent enough to lead this country. He is short sighted and smitten with @gmbutts & his utopian ideas. Many natives are in favour of the TMX. Importing oil from Saudis for next 25 yrs is INSANE. But Quebec won
852 2018-11-26 22:42:17 Two things to make it work.  You have to rein back the old and grow the new. Some will happen naturally, some need a  disincentive and some need a carrot.  Oil needs both to gear down and to diversify.  New Tech needs money to jump in & make it work. Meanwhile floods and fire.
853 2018-11-26 22:42:17 우정이라는 기계에 잘 정제된 예의라는 기름을 바르는 것은 현명하다.
It is wise to apply the oil of refined politeness to the mechanisms of friendship.
854 2018-11-26 22:42:02 Except for oil
855 2018-11-26 22:41:45 You ask why they (the GOP) can't admit this?? First, the majority of the GOP denies the scientific evidence! Second, the GOP is in bed with the oil, gas and coal industry - along with the auto industry! #FollowTheMoney
856 2018-11-26 22:41:45 You'd think the oil companies et al would have a vested interest in funding research which produces favorable results for them. I guess the only reason that doesn't happen (except for maybe 3%) is because their moral high ground is just too doggonit high.
857 2018-11-26 22:41:43 I guess this is "sub-tweeting" but I know he gets upset when people call him out so I don't bother pointlessly trying to debate. Were the Scottish public informed that the largest oil field discovered in Europe would be coming on-line in 2018? Unequivocally they were not.
858 2018-11-26 22:41:36 1. it was only "southward" at recent peak oil (and one year only in last 20-odd as SG now accept their oil revenue alloctaions were overly generous) - and well before the vote it was clear that oil was in decline and indy was a reckless gamble on oil
859 2018-11-26 22:41:32 When I went to school I was told oil would run out by 2020. We are almost in 2020 and the cost of oil might be the lowest in history adjusted to inflation cost.

I ask the liberals what is so green about shipping coal 6000 miles to the middle of china to make US steel??
860 2018-11-26 22:41:30 I personally think Camargo is better than Swanson. So I could see them trading dansby for a starting pitcher. If they don’t go out and sign someone to play right I could see them moving Acuna to right and play Camargo in left.
861 2018-11-26 22:41:30 Who wants to fome with me to get my oil changed? Ill buy ya a beer
862 2018-11-26 22:41:29 Sorry Jerry you reap what you sow. Western Canada will not forget how you rallied against the oil sands and their workers.
863 2018-11-26 22:41:21 Somebody on my Facebook who sells essential oils in an MLM company just posted an event she’s hosting: “Wine Tasting: which wine pairs best with which essential oil?” and I think I just had an aneurysm.

868 2018-11-26 22:41:01 Every couple months when I come to the jiffy lube in San Marcos for an oil change I swear they always got The Goonies playing. I can’t be the only one whose noticed this?
869 2018-11-26 22:41:01 So syrup is motor oil ? I’m really confused
870 2018-11-26 22:40:58 @RichardLeong2 I read your article "Foreign buyers find U.S. Treasuries less appealing". Do you think that Saudi Arabia may be forced to buy some following Khashoggi's assination and low oil price? Thank you for sharing. Good article.
871 2018-11-26 22:40:45 Do you of these economic illiterates know what options are available to lower fuel prices. Things like producing more petroleum or cutting taxes on oil.
872 2018-11-26 22:40:43 Made some wax oil 
873 2018-11-26 22:40:42 Fresh oil.
874 2018-11-26 22:40:25 They just dont get it. The oil is the oil companies. BP in this case.
875 2018-11-26 22:40:23 髪がさーサラサラしてるのちょっと気にしてんだよなー
876 2018-11-26 22:40:19 And yet you’re creating more terrorists by supporting Saudi Arabia ...Have you forgotten that most of the 9/11 terrorists were Saudi citizens? When will America cut ties with Saudi Arabia and stop being led by oil and delusions of wealth?
Why do we value profits over human lives?
877 2018-11-26 22:40:18 So @tertasha has caught my cold from the weekend. To say she’s drenched every surface imaginable in Olbas Oil would be an understatement!! . 

I’m definitely paying the price.
878 2018-11-26 22:40:18 The 3pp 100 slot is altered fairly quickly after something new is created

881 2018-11-26 22:40:10 You lie.  You don't want any oil moving.  That is obvious from Bill C69.  Natives will continue in poverty.

889 2018-11-26 22:39:47 I'll back Sanders if he wins the primary, but you are lying about Beto taking big oil $, at least regarding his Senate campaign. Losing to Cruz is a dishonest argument.
890 2018-11-26 22:39:43 Scenarios I have planned for my Mutants & Masterminds campaign:
1) A group of body builders who use a super soldier serum as body oil.
2) Defending a queer punk band as they play a concert from a Nazi band that got powers.
3) Going undercover in a supervilllain prison.
891 2018-11-26 22:39:17 It is 83k much haba how much is a live goat, bag of rice, veg oil etc
892 2018-11-26 22:39:01 If that was true couldn't you just say "computer, train hubby how to oil change, set skill level 10"
893 2018-11-26 22:38:59 And even without this economic analysis, the gradual decline in oil production can easily be offset by a more rapid decline in consumption. I just don't understand the hostility to this approach.
894 2018-11-26 22:38:55 Also that’s avocado oil I use it for ma hair
895 2018-11-26 22:38:55 Oh and cook with coconut oil or ghee!

898 2018-11-26 22:38:27 I'm not a chef & honestly don't like to cook, so I simply toss in olive oil with salt, pepper, garlic powder & parmesan...I love it, that's how I roast all my veggies.
899 2018-11-26 22:38:13 Until it’s oil change time on all ten of them, or the batteries decide to give up on all of them at once, I know. It’s got its perks though
900 2018-11-26 22:38:01 good. Now How about the 10’s of thousands of oil workers and contractors out of work for pipeline the government purchased?  What’s the federal government doing to rectify this?
901 2018-11-26 22:37:53 Lol no joke, this looks exactly like my chicken. Olive oil, salt, pepper, Tony’s extra spice, and some lemon pepper for good measure
902 2018-11-26 22:37:47 It’s not about a crime being committed. It is about the hypocrisy and ethics. It’s also still under investigation. The failure to properly disclose the transactions. Amazing those who profess patriotism As long as it serves their purpose. With a snake oil salesman at the helm.
903 2018-11-26 22:37:34  you do know we only get the tax revenue on any profits made by the oil companies yes? Does the SNP have plans to nationalise oil production? No? Dont know? Good luck with that.
904 2018-11-26 22:37:29 Oil palace the 15th
905 2018-11-26 22:37:26 We have a technical report analyzing CA oils (will post) but it's based on a limited # of assays. Having actual assays would be helpful for life cycle analysis as well as for safety of oil transport. Unclear why assays aren't required to be reported now, just based on safety.

907 2018-11-26 22:37:15 True but I'm sure it's also an amazing feeling too! 
908 2018-11-26 22:37:12 And? US oil exports are at record highs, all that production sure is not flooding US markets to lower prices for working blokes is it?
909 2018-11-26 22:37:08 Thank you- us too!
910 2018-11-26 22:36:59 Your source is BS. There are zero subsidies for O&G. Your $3.3B claim is bullshit written by an anti oil foreign funded propaganda organization. That's like the Russians saying they've spent $10B on Syria!
911 2018-11-26 22:36:57 It didn’t come from leach or the school, though. The push for leach back to tech is coming from some former players of his that made it big in the oil game and the AD’s office has said they aren’t interested
912 2018-11-26 22:36:56 Coconoil is the best coconut oil I’ve used ever
913 2018-11-26 22:36:47 Does it make sense for Germany to cancel getting their oil from Russia in response to this? I remember that Trump was angry with Merkel about Germany getting their oil from Russia. That could be interesting. With oil price low, it might make sense for others including US to help.
914 2018-11-26 22:36:43 my plug is home so I’m on a mission to get a new oil cartridge in a few lol
915 2018-11-26 22:36:35 칭찬 감사합니다!^^///

917 2018-11-26 22:36:28 Try my beard oil and I promise u won't regret it. Buy one oil and get one free leave in conditioner, that will soften ur hair for the whole for easy combing. Specially formulated for natural hair, without relaxer.
918 2018-11-26 22:36:27 It means NOTHING when the GOP & Trump sell our country out for the price of Saudi oil.
919 2018-11-26 22:36:13 But we will ignore a country that murders a US resident as long as they buy arms from us and condos from trump. Oil price is just a bonus.
920 2018-11-26 22:36:08 there's seriously nothing to watch....imma just oil my scalp or something
921 2018-11-26 22:35:55 OH I SUPPOSE ITS NOT PALM OIL THEYRE SMOTHERING MELON MOMO IN IS IT?
922 2018-11-26 22:35:46 Coconut oil on a cotton pad. Works like a charm!!
923 2018-11-26 22:35:41 It’s the religion angle sold by a top notch con man. Unfortunately I’ve experienced a few con men in my life with dire consequences, but a lot of people haven’t. Some Trump supporters are decent and trusting and think he’s being truthful. He’s a snake oil salesman.
924 2018-11-26 22:35:41 If climate change is science then so is economics
925 2018-11-26 22:35:27 haha always! Someones gotta waste that oil money
926 2018-11-26 22:35:24 @ToneVays WFT, Weatherford International, a huge global oil and gas co looks like a great buy. Mind giving it a look/analysis on ur show?
927 2018-11-26 22:35:24 Meanwhile the GOP & Trump endorse a murderous prince. They sold us out for the price of oil. 15 of the 19 Sept 11th terrorists were from Saudi. Your support of MBS is  a slap in the face of every victim of 9/11, as well as all of us who ever wore a uniform. Traitors!
928 2018-11-26 22:35:23 Thanks my lovely! x
929 2018-11-26 22:35:20 dirty?  product distillates from tar sands (such as gasoline and heating oil) may produce slightly higher levels of carbon dioxide, but difference is slight.
930 2018-11-26 22:35:20 Possibly but SP tends to come with term & that's rarely a good idea. Best starter likely to get signed to a reasonable number and term is Happ but there'll be many suitors. That said, I get where you are coming from. Could Camargo steal some ABs in the OF and SS?
931 2018-11-26 22:35:19 I agree. If AB had invested 1/10th of the resources they put in the oil sector, they would be a world leader in solar technology.
932 2018-11-26 22:35:16 I prefer cold water because I do my makeup at 6 am and it helps wake me up. Also an ice cold beauty sponge feels amazing in the summer. And yes I wash my beauty sponge(s) after each use before people start attacking. Hot water and tea tree oil 
933 2018-11-26 22:35:15 An oil change
934 2018-11-26 22:35:06 I hope so too! Pooping myself already! lol x
935 2018-11-26 22:35:06 RT @LivingSafely: Pop-Secret #Homestyle this December? Its top two ingredients are #popcorn and partially hydrogenated soybean oil.
936 2018-11-26 22:35:03 Don't forget all the oilfield workers voted for you to keep their jobs going. Lower oil prices means less work for them and u lose a shit ton of votes
937 2018-11-26 22:34:51 Cardenas was totally left! Not just due to the oil expropriation but because of the social programs with the downtrodden and the inclusion of the indigenous people to the Mexican citizenship. claiming that the rest of the PRI was left because of him it's completly outrageous.
938 2018-11-26 22:34:44 Girl this take 5 oil place is bomb
939 2018-11-26 22:34:20 And heat up the olive oil, season but thas all.
940 2018-11-26 22:34:03 If we stopped going to war on behalf of defense contractors and oil companies and giving billions in subsidies to corporations, there'd be plenty of money to pay for things to help the American people. We could even buy you a big box of capital letters...
941 2018-11-26 22:33:58 So there is a strong African American working and middle class in MS; most are involved in gas/oil industries and with NASA. So don't let the rankings fool you.

943 2018-11-26 22:33:53 The nigggga doing my oil change looks like sex 
944 2018-11-26 22:33:48 Literal France has riot of the people because of the oil taxes so you are right in that regard.
945 2018-11-26 22:33:46 Qu’entendez-vous vous par :
« Qui dira que le changement climatique et l’air pollué de nos villes sont moins dangereux que le tabac ou l’alcool ? » ?

Bizarre cette phrase
946 2018-11-26 22:33:46 In Belle Tire to get my oil changed. The guy proceeds to tell me that my car is pretty much a piece of crap and the battery will probably fail next time I drive it. But I just need my oil changed, but THANK YOU for trying 
947 2018-11-26 22:33:44 It will be the best car - so aero dynamic - and we’ll get big oil to pay for it.

Well..I don't like it.. so..I just like making them all happy again. :) 

You all know that even MM Cantor's is going to look stupid sitting on the ask as oil just keeps flooding to BP.
950 2018-11-26 22:33:16 Still at infinity waiting on my car. With appointment over two and half hours and still waiting sad affairs just for an oil change. Nissan please note
951 2018-11-26 22:33:10 @dstaples Wonder if any stats geeks get keep track of teams scored on with goalie pulled vs getting a goal, what the average is, etc. Some teams seem to play in that situation as if possession matters even more than usual (duh), Oil still give it away a lot and then guess what??
952 2018-11-26 22:32:55 OIL MONEY COMING TO THE USA BABY 
953 2018-11-26 22:32:52 More news NOT reported by @CNN @ABC @NBCNews @CBSNews French President Macron is putting in place a carbon tax because of liberal BS global warming crap! Gas prices over $7 a gallon! The people R pissed! He’s forcing solar & electric power. The US #1 oil maker &cleanest country!!

To first order, long-term Ed and Es are similarly inelastic (to yr point, @rcollier) but with opp. signs, say +/- 0.3.  Pick different Es if you want and do the math!

960 2018-11-26 22:32:16 I just sliced some red potatoes, boiled them for a while but not too long to take away the crunch. Minced some onion and green pepper in some olive oil and seasoning, fried and crunched up some bacon, tossed it in a pan of Italian marinade with some broccoli... NIGGA!!! 
961 2018-11-26 22:32:13 Pro tip: each cup of vegetable oil you drink adds approximately 10 kilograms to your stamina 
962 2018-11-26 22:31:59 C'mon @realDonaldTrump didn't read that report! He simply doesn't care about climate change! He's in with @PutinRF_Eng & Big Oil, 2 stop any progress we try 2 make towards clean energy! They aggressively combat whatever costs them money! No matter the costs everyone else!

965 2018-11-26 22:31:42 These issues were pointed out many years ago but Harper didn't need to listen when oil was at $120 a Barrel. Building pipelines takes time. They just don't fall in place.

967 2018-11-26 22:31:36 Where is your support for the energy industry- 225,000 people’s jobs are at risk.  Oshawa deserves support but ignoring the Oil industry is ignorant.  Or is Oshawa a  better headline to make you look better.
968 2018-11-26 22:31:29 It would seem to me, that by throwing out all the stupid climate change crap, we increasing US oil production, and lowering the price of global oil. 
If US oil energy production is not bad for Saudi's, Russia what is?
Democrats policies in general make for higher energy prices.
969 2018-11-26 22:31:25 Is anyone else excited that we’re about to start Fracking Mars for oil & natural gas?
970 2018-11-26 22:31:18 Misled by the damned #MSM media again! Between this and the secret oil fields I'm going right off them.
971 2018-11-26 22:31:15 Please, Are you the ambassador of castor oil?
972 2018-11-26 22:31:14 Now, as I watch the sunrise.
Ah, the smell of oil, the morning light.
There's but one shadow cast on the asphalt.

976 2018-11-26 22:30:58 I don’t know it worked so far in North Korea & oil prices. Worth a shot
977 2018-11-26 22:30:57 Also the issue of coconut oil in most tube feeds, making it very unpleasant for those allergic.
978 2018-11-26 22:30:55 Good to know. I make all my money in Bakken oil.  I’m willing to take a hit, most people aren’t. ND is built on oil, taking the steps that need to be taken would be political suicide.
979 2018-11-26 22:30:54 similar but the smell of the oil lamp in the outside damp toilet, dad used to use it to stop pipes freezing.

982 2018-11-26 22:30:45 Thanks for sharing Becky!  I have anxiety for over 20 years...it’s always nice to see you’re not alone!  Have you ever tried hemp oil...

991 2018-11-26 22:30:26 The pipeline is currently moving oil and making a profit,
992 2018-11-26 22:30:26 Any mention of same tariff on foreign oil  ?
993 2018-11-26 22:30:25 so this bitch came in today for her 20,000 mile service and she skipped her last two services which means she’s never had an oil change before

1002 2018-11-26 22:29:45 How anyone in the national media can respect Hue as a head coach for the shit job he did is amazing. He was an absolute fake and a snake oil salesman. Haslam got dooped big time. Baker doesn’t buy into the bullshit (or other players). Why should we?
1003 2018-11-26 22:29:38 Rosneft chief rebukes Venezuela oil shipments...
1004 2018-11-26 22:29:26 So do I use one in the Differential?
1005 2018-11-26 22:29:24 Working out just fine. Oil is moving and its got about 4.4% return already
1006 2018-11-26 22:29:20 Good one. Though not to hard when you have their oil and a population of a small UK city. Venezuela has loads of oil too of course so it looks like an Absolute Monarchy beats socialism too.

1009 2018-11-26 22:29:15 Ah. I’m not a doctor, I don’t have any degrees, but I research constantly. I diagnosed my MS years before my doctor, who told me, “That’s why people like you shouldn’t research things they don’t understand.”
Some supplements have helped, some not. 
Have you tried CBD oil?
1010 2018-11-26 22:29:07 Well agreed my friend.
1011 2018-11-26 22:29:01 They aren't selling pipeline oil to US. They are exporting it from NO, LA. They send ours on a truck.
1012 2018-11-26 22:29:00 when you think abour Labour history , and its plans for Scottish oil , the black stuff was to mitigate such policies in England.

I doubt that idea has changed.
1013 2018-11-26 22:28:59 Agreed.  USTs acting like the sovereign debt of a major oil producing nation with EM-like wealth discrepancies for whom deficits matter.  :)
1014 2018-11-26 22:28:53 Don't forget, the electoral college voted for a blow-hard, inexperienced, inept, know-nothing snake oil salesman from Queens. Beto's experience meter is already above that.
1015 2018-11-26 22:28:49 The Canadian economy is losing $80 million dollars a day because of the oil price gap.
1016 2018-11-26 22:28:48 CBD oil is helpful during pregnancy which there are other way to get besides smoking. The smoke is what makes it bad during pregnancy! It helps people with nausea when you can’t eat and end up losing an unhealthy amount of weight!
1017 2018-11-26 22:28:36 Well, imagine it would have been chocolate-scented oil... what would any of us do?

1023 2018-11-26 22:28:02 I believe that Canadians r smart enough to do both: still participate fully in the resource/oil industry AND work towards more green technology. Why does Trudeau think that Canadians can only do one thing at a time? 25 yrs is a long time to import Saudi oil by tanker, overseas...
1024 2018-11-26 22:28:02 Tbh it's not that bad, I don't mind the night sweats it's like free heating (central heating is not a thing in this house) i lost my shit over a bit of cheese the other day <that's new bad temper levels and it's amazing what you can use coconut oil for #menopause
1025 2018-11-26 22:27:59 @realDonaldTrump Read with interest your attempted shake down of the Iraqi Prime Minister to give the US Oil to pay for the invasions of Iraq by the US.   Don't see you racing to pay back all your bond holders and stock holders in Trump Resorts that you screwed over..
1026 2018-11-26 22:27:59 That’s motor oil tho

1030 2018-11-26 22:27:45 @MartinSLewis how can I budget for oil? Price change and they constantly send out frightening emails saying that prices are soaring. Paying lump sums is getting harder. I do Boilerjuice but savings aren’t great. Please help
1031 2018-11-26 22:27:39  what can I say! #Boom #SBS #OnTopForm 
1032 2018-11-26 22:27:33 Lol no it wouldn’t. And this week Trump saidat a press briefing you can thank me for the lower oil prices
1033 2018-11-26 22:27:33 I appreciate @AndrewScheer work ethic. Oshawa, where I used to live, will be seriously hurt by this. Just because Scheer is looking at this doesn’t mean he’s not as or more concerned about oil patch struggles. Unlike @JustinTrudeau he gets more than one meeting a day on agenda.
1034 2018-11-26 22:27:32 Donnie Boy, You've got it all wrong again.  Falling oil prices are not always good for the long-term economy.  Maybe you need to take a  Macro-economics 101 class.
1035 2018-11-26 22:27:30 @GM are you bending to oil company demands by eliminating the Volt. This is a great car. Saves lots of money and pollution. Do not cow tow to oil.
1036 2018-11-26 22:27:26 "Instead of spiking, oil prices have slumped. Concerns about slowing global growth and weaker demand have also weighed on prices. The decline could lead to less investment in new rigs in oil-producing U.S. states, offsetting the overall impact on economic growth."

1041 2018-11-26 22:26:54 She's berating company's that capitalise on young women's insecurities, by promoting an unrealistic body image, whilst enlisting a celeb-would-be-rolemodel to sell their pseudo-snake oil potions
1042 2018-11-26 22:26:53 I understand following the market but GM and Ford are setting up a perfect repeat of the oil crisis in the 70s only make big suvs and trucks cause thats what people want, but when the inevitable gas price spike comes theyre gonna be screwed when they dont sell cars anymore
1043 2018-11-26 22:26:52 Would you like to tell me what is wrong with what I've just said? Ps I'm 6'2".

Not so little. Trouble with you fantasist is you just dont think about the real world and why we all need oil and gas. You think you magic it away and all will be fine. You silly little woman :)
1044 2018-11-26 22:26:52 You have nothing to do with oil prices.
1045 2018-11-26 22:26:46 Your oil and gas propaganda isn't going to cut it with anyone with a brain.
1046 2018-11-26 22:26:45 We have a similar problem with crude oil in Canada. Pipelines would fix the problem.

I don’t know your hair type but I’ve been using oil treatments once a week and hair masks after every wash. Still taking longer than I’d like but my hair is healthier and won’t need a trim for a while

1055 2018-11-26 22:26:13 Que pasa con @PumaEnergyArg  que esta faltando gas oil desde el viernes 23/11/18????????
1056 2018-11-26 22:26:03 To clean up after oil changes!
1057 2018-11-26 22:25:57 Price as always has been is set by the supply-demand principle. Every oil-producing country has reached its full capacity and has done its part in flooding the market. A $150 price is surely inevitable, if we see the world will still be thirsty for oil in the next 3 years.
1058 2018-11-26 22:25:42 The man isn't lying..... look at the prices of oil with regard to political issues and pressure put on OPEC, Saudi Arabia leads the way. If not, why would you all be complaining right now? As for liberty and all that jazz, that has very little to do with global consumption of oil
1059 2018-11-26 22:25:35 Thank you for the warm welcome!
1060 2018-11-26 22:25:34 Yes, yes, like I said, the point stands.
It's just a pet peeve held over from when I was studying astrophysics and I'd get ask a lot of medical science questions from my family.
Were there no climate scientists available I'd still choose a physicist over an oil lobbyist any day.
1061 2018-11-26 22:25:34 “... the Atlantic Council clearly exists to further the interests of those involved in weapons manufacturing, wars, and oil.”
1062 2018-11-26 22:25:27 I bet motor oil tastes better too
1063 2018-11-26 22:25:21 Sadly this is #Iraq, one of the the richest country on the planet, with the second largest oil reserve!!!
1064 2018-11-26 22:25:01 Get a modern oil based radiator if you are at all sensitive to fan noise.
1065 2018-11-26 22:24:55 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
1066 2018-11-26 22:24:55 They just started to dig for oil.
1067 2018-11-26 22:24:40 Trump thanks Saudi Arabia for low oil prices, but ignores murder of journalist. So this is a consolation? #TrumpCrimeFamily
1068 2018-11-26 22:24:28 How can you obtian marookh oil from ethene?
1069 2018-11-26 22:24:22 You’re very welcome Congratulations 
1070 2018-11-26 22:24:08 Yes, it makes sense that it's more complicated. How does CA oil stack up?
1071 2018-11-26 22:24:02 Lol...but ironically by the time we create a system viable enough to import oil from Mars there actually wouldn't be any need for oil. We would be running on sustainable battery technology!!
1072 2018-11-26 22:23:51 The burning tires created that smoke - but the U.S. professor went to the area and found no damage. He believes it was some boat with tires and oil which was burned for the photographer. & of course w/ all the PR anti-Serb propagandists they were demonized thoroughly. Ruder-Finn
1073 2018-11-26 22:23:50 He looks like an excellent snake oil salesman. The best in the business.
1074 2018-11-26 22:23:49 Did you issue your thoughts over the oil industry- you hardly mention it
1075 2018-11-26 22:23:47 just tried to be super organised and do and hair mask and wash before bed but I’ve now dried my hair and it appears the oil from the mask has most definitely not been washed out :) looks like I’ll be up early to re wash said hair :)
1076 2018-11-26 22:23:35 Lmao right when u said motor oil it made my stomach hurt thinking about accidently taking a bite thinking it’s syrup
1077 2018-11-26 22:23:22 They want to destroy everything so Trump and Russia can drill for oil
 Think about it 7f yhe ice cap melts they will drill
1078 2018-11-26 22:23:10 We learned our lesson with the AVRO ARROW, if we build a better mouse trap (automobile) the US will not allow it to take market share from the BIG 3 and Big Oil. But I can still see Trudeau wasting $billions trying.
1079 2018-11-26 22:23:08 To have a president that does not believe in climate change is a big win for oil company's and the the people that lobby for them.  Young people and the unborn have a dim future if this kind of thinking by our leaders continues!
1080 2018-11-26 22:23:03 Coconut oil
1081 2018-11-26 22:23:00 Sanctions on Iran, Saudi and Russia overproduced thinking they could fill gap,but Trump gave 8 countries waivers,Turkey,Japan etc. But not Germany or France or majority of Europe. Created oil glut, price dropped. 2019 Texas Permian basin oil online could drop them too.
1082 2018-11-26 22:22:57 In their last annual report, NZ Refining said they'd relifed their hydrogen production unit, which means imported oil by-product is going to be used to produce hydrogen. Heh, oil and gas exploration ban means more imported.
1083 2018-11-26 22:22:57 Dear Finance min!! 

Please also note that from 2008 to around 2013 oil price international was 142$/barrel and PPP government was providing petrol around 90Rs/lit.
@PTIofficial @BilawalHouse_PK
1084 2018-11-26 22:22:46 All nice things to talk about, and surely over time those changes will take place WITHOUT the carbon tax. Oil demand will increase at least for the next 20 years & Canada, as a resource nation, shld not stand idly by. That would be a travesty.
1085 2018-11-26 22:22:43 Lots of legacy industries will either have to undergo massive change or shutdown. Oil companies , gas stations , automakers, auto suppliers, service centers, auto parts stores the list goes on. Change is hard and expensive. But in this case, necessary. Adapt fast and survive.
1086 2018-11-26 22:22:38 His statement could be applied to himself-He's not doing so well, he didn't sell well during the election, they need to replace him with something that will sell well. Actually, he is just an unaware elitist. "Let them eat motor oil" is going to be his motto.
1087 2018-11-26 22:22:37 So oil down?
1088 2018-11-26 22:22:31 You do realize we are the 3rd largest oil producers in the world and topping 10 million barrels per day, right? Will become number 1 as soon as we start offshore drilling and give federal land back to the states
1089 2018-11-26 22:22:23 If we had a NEP we'd be in the best position now. If we'd built refineries we'd have got maximum profit from our non-renewable resources. IMO the Tapcal Trust Fund PCs captive to US companies who profited off our cheap oil. We do have that refinery that is costing us billions.
1090 2018-11-26 22:22:17 It's not a question of belief in doomongering, the serious point today is that we now know we're being led by cowardly dimwits through a minefield, over a tall cliff & into an ocean of boiling oil. These pillocks are more likely to lead us to oblivion than prosperity. #Brexit
1091 2018-11-26 22:22:13 I went to a medical herbalist when I was 49, she recommended cod liver oil & evening primrose combined. Still taking it, no symptoms
1092 2018-11-26 22:22:03 I want sardines !! Not the fresh sardines. I want the canned sardines in oil. With Dijon mustard  on toast. Yoooo. Yaaasssssss
1093 2018-11-26 22:22:01 drink water and oil yer kneecaps folks, the days r getting shorter n so is ur lifespan. ride it out
1094 2018-11-26 22:22:01 It's way, way better than store-bought! If you want to add matzoh balls, you just need matzoh meal, egg, some good oil (you know the one ) and just some salt and pepper! Measurements on the matzoh meal box work fine.

Risotto you can make any way, go nuts!
1095 2018-11-26 22:21:55 Oil companies are working for the advancement humanity and don't let money influence their opinions
Because
Because
Because they have integrity

Shit that's hard to write
1096 2018-11-26 22:21:50 After seeing some changes then u are aware the oil works and u will go on with it until u get exact length and fullness u want. It been consistent with the usage and been patient, eating more of vitamin contained food, taking supplement like biotin.
1097 2018-11-26 22:21:47 I don't think the math adds up for them to win in the long-term even if they capture and remove CO2 from the process. Certainly coal for electricity and oil for transport wont be competitive.
1098 2018-11-26 22:21:43 Elections have consequences ...I wonder how that snake oil tastes now.
1099 2018-11-26 22:21:43 I hate money. There's never enough of it and people always fight about it. But just because I hate it doesn't mean I'm not afraid to make it my b#$%&. <x-P
1100 2018-11-26 22:21:34 An orange, bicycle oil, a rubber bucket.
1101 2018-11-26 22:21:31 Getting a oil change is annoying
1102 2018-11-26 22:21:16 Have you tried CBD oil?
1103 2018-11-26 22:21:14 オリーブ油で毎日を楽しく(*^_^*)
1104 2018-11-26 22:21:11 I feel not enough Christmas cards feature oil refineries...
1105 2018-11-26 22:21:11 Fucking junkie, let’s do some CBD oil heroin together bro
1106 2018-11-26 22:21:10 Y’all really think you’re eating motor oil?  Wow
1107 2018-11-26 22:21:10   What like the Oil and Gas just before her already written UN speech #fake
1108 2018-11-26 22:21:05 And no money coming from western oil to help either. #poorleadership
1109 2018-11-26 22:21:04 Yup, like you have helped the workers in the oil patch
1110 2018-11-26 22:21:00 does roger taylor use motor oil as pancake syrup
1111 2018-11-26 22:20:59 This is what is Wrong with corporate greedy donors. Dems should kick those Oil and Gas greedy bastards to the curb.
1112 2018-11-26 22:20:50 This is amazing. The people in Tunisia are protesting against MBS while ,the POTUS, Donald Trump, wants to sweep the whole torture and murder of Jamal Khashoggi under the rug  just so that we can continue to get 13% of our oil cheaply. Shame on Trump!
1113 2018-11-26 22:20:45 Lose the palm oil and we'll consider it.
1114 2018-11-26 22:20:43 My feet so damn slippery with all this fucking oil
1115 2018-11-26 22:20:40 I've owned GM products for years and never had a problem with any of them...my last one had over 100,000 miles on it and ran like a charm until a moose tried to jump over it and totaled it. Oil changes and regularly scheduled tune ups was all they ever needed and new tires.
1116 2018-11-26 22:20:29 ❝I'm sure❞ he replies. 

  The droid then nods. 

   ❝I don't eat, but I drink oil❞ he replies, looking over to the stack of cans, smiling a bit. 

   ❝Tastes good just thinking about it❞
1117 2018-11-26 22:20:29 my face has never felt this dry before. I’m about to dunk my head in Lavender oil

1122 2018-11-26 22:19:57 I use grape seed oil after cleansing my face with Aveeno. It’s for sensitive skin, helps clear acne, and leaves a nice light glow also helps treat acne scars and doesn’t clog your pores!
1123 2018-11-26 22:19:52 Just looking at change in markets since the close... oil was up during cash session so had partially priced in the move
1124 2018-11-26 22:19:46 Ur head get oil
1125 2018-11-26 22:19:43 Ok so are you aware that fracking has like created thousands of jobs and there are more people working as rigger than ever before? So why are you under some assumption it will phase out their work.
1126 2018-11-26 22:19:12 got a chemical burn on my face from tea tree oil its swollen n blistery n i have to give a presentation in a few days i love that for me
1127 2018-11-26 22:19:05 Thank you! Amazing feeling! #SBS
1128 2018-11-26 22:19:01 bang energy not only offers a variety of flavors but the drink itself is clear!! it doesn’t look or taste like motor oil. packed w BCAAs & provides much more caffeine than most energy drinks. try it today 
1129 2018-11-26 22:18:59 オイルだって怒るんだぞ怒ったら引火してギトギトのボーボーにしてやるからな
1130 2018-11-26 22:18:52 Blackhead itu kayanya, aku pake cleansing oil sering gituuu
1131 2018-11-26 22:18:50 i'm getting an oil change & i can hear them talking shit about my missing passenger mirror 
1132 2018-11-26 22:18:48 食パンさん、おはよーございます！
1133 2018-11-26 22:18:38 I was laughed at today by someone much younger than me because I wouldn’t eat an Oreo because they contain palm oil! I explained that I don’t want orangutans to become extinct! She asked me why I was bothered about that? I daren’t ask if she has ever voted?
1134 2018-11-26 22:18:35 I heard it was condom oil 
1135 2018-11-26 22:18:21 Swear to god all of y’all have trust issues now after seeing that it’s motor oil and not syrup
1136 2018-11-26 22:18:17 Featured with beans cooked with firewood/charcoal, left to break during cooking, as in ko'fo pete-pete and now served with stew fried with well heated red oil, and not forgetting #150 Ore-ofe/Ore-oluwa loaf and two sachet water... 
1137 2018-11-26 22:18:11 OIL PRICE ROLLBACK

The following Petron petroleum products will have the corresponding rollback (VAT-inclusive) in their prices effective 6 a.m. Tuesday, November 27:

*Gasoline – P1.10 per liter
*Kerosene – P2.10 per liter
*Diesel – P2.30 per liter
1138 2018-11-26 22:18:11 Maybe Big Oil ?
1139 2018-11-26 22:18:02 If there's oil or gold in my compound it's the governments'

But the weeds that grow are mine ehn 
1140 2018-11-26 22:17:55 Where were the news cameras when tens of thousands of oil patch jobs disappeared? If it had happened in Ontario or Quebec it would lead every newscast.
1141 2018-11-26 22:17:52 I worked in the oil fields in Utah in the 80's. The locals think way different then most people think. I'm not saying they are bad just different.
1142 2018-11-26 22:17:52 Off course he believes climate change is real. He pretends not to believe it because of his oil/gas and money interests
1143 2018-11-26 22:17:49 The biggest of these 50 are big oil companies, but people can avoid driving.
1144 2018-11-26 22:17:49 Thanks! I noticed it back 15-20 years ago, everyone in Alberta's oil/gas industry despised Suzuki. Turned out far-right operatives like Ezra Levant had been writing character assassinations (obviously because Suzuki led the way on climate change awareness. But, a newer smear..1/3
1145 2018-11-26 22:17:35 Incredible how these things framed in absolute terms immune to any external variables. 1st person has this "right," to be accommodated, the 40 millionth person in 4 country triangle has the same right regardless. This applies to 190+ countries?
1146 2018-11-26 22:17:29 こちらこそヨロシクお願いしますね(^o^)ﾁｮｷﾁｮｷ
1147 2018-11-26 22:17:29 Did the white men really give our forefathers mirrors in exchange for crude oil??  
1148 2018-11-26 22:17:26 And there will be more Poutine on Trump’s red tie after the G20, will match the stain after Helsinki.  Follow the money folks, and it will explain Saudi and Russian nob gobbling that Trump does.  Oh ya, guess there is oil money too with his climate change denial. Pathetic.
1149 2018-11-26 22:17:22 The suggestion that folk who highlighted the cover-up of Clair Ridge during 2014 were conspiracy theorist nutjobs is extremely offensive. Leask tells us that the largest oil field in Europe was well publicised at the time. 
Is there any evidence whatsoever to back up that claim?
1150 2018-11-26 22:17:17 Palm oil melts steel beams.
1151 2018-11-26 22:17:04 Had my annual inspection today. The doctor cleared me for another year and said I was in surprisingly good shape, all things considered. He did, however, recommend that I start using the high mileage synthetic oil when I cook.
1152 2018-11-26 22:16:59 Thank you  #buzzing
1153 2018-11-26 22:16:59 Lol ...i know you do you told me once about advfn hotcopper etc atb big Dave viva the weald  atb
1154 2018-11-26 22:16:54 friends not coming home, volunteer for war for oil and opioids but muh feelz and greater good yes please
1155 2018-11-26 22:16:50 SERIOUSLY! What gives any migrant the right to impose their burden on a sovereign nation. As it stands for Muslim Nations (oil) it stands for America. You can't just invite yourself in taking advantage of our riches. At least in Democratic since, these they invite you in.
1156 2018-11-26 22:16:50 Tony Benn advocated a sovereign wealth fund based on North sea oil.
1157 2018-11-26 22:16:46 I applaud citizens of France for protesting fuel tax increase= These PC Shill politicians should be jailed along with their Crony money men. As for Alberta I support their right to use their Oil anyway they want. Screw the leftists and the crony capitalists
1158 2018-11-26 22:16:44 Any amount of oil co “payment” would would cause their loyal employees to work even harder to grow their company. Reduce production of fossil fuel by putting one of those 100 companies out of business, causing the remaining 99 to compete to be the last on the chopping block.
1159 2018-11-26 22:16:35 Wait, there's money?

Tell that to all the scientists working on this stuff that would be making at least 2X if we were working in the oil and gas industry...
1160 2018-11-26 22:16:35 The oil lobby vs. climate science....which is driven by money?
1161 2018-11-26 22:16:35 Coconut oil
1162 2018-11-26 22:16:21 I was under the impression Obama had made us self-sufficient & we no longer survived on Saudi oil. 
Trump loves them for their $$$. 

I'm with you. They're murderers.
1163 2018-11-26 22:16:20 Not ignorance dude and you know that. He knows they’re right but doesn’t care because the money trumps all else, and it lies with his buddies in coal and oil
1164 2018-11-26 22:16:19 It's mostly oil, I never liked it it as kid too.
1165 2018-11-26 22:16:18 Editing an oil painting video. Practicing with digital art. Redoing my website. Updating my shop and RedBubble. Trying to make things that I like, that people will also want to buy 
1166 2018-11-26 22:16:12 Oil or water?
1167 2018-11-26 22:16:12 Does this have retinol? I’m wondering what makes it special as a night time oil.
1168 2018-11-26 22:16:11 Yeah I just don’t see him staying healthy. I also think Camargo could put up similar stats for way cheaper. I think the braves should have spent that money to try to get a starting pitcher because I think that is way more of a need for them
1169 2018-11-26 22:15:58 That one video has ruined everything for us damn motor oil
1170 2018-11-26 22:15:56 anybody use tea tree oil to grow their hair?
1171 2018-11-26 22:15:56 Shocking claim by @Nissan @NissanUSA its most expensive vehicle will self destruct if it is late for an oil change!! Unbelievable!!
1172 2018-11-26 22:15:51 (2) The incoming UCP joins SK, Ont, and MB and NB in opposing the C02 tax. Lawsuits are launched, and the climate plan is lost. Alberta's energy sector is now dead, and investment $$ have moved on. We wind up the only country in the world #3 on oil reserves, but we have to import
1173 2018-11-26 22:15:47 Mix 2 quarts kiwi with 4 tsps carne asada. Add Olive Oil. Chill.  Serve on a bed of pasta
1174 2018-11-26 22:15:47 why don't you stop using it altogether?replace it with all rapeseed oil.I have been a Cadburys chocoholic for years but your sales will now fall as I have stopped buying all palm oil chocolate & am going to get my friends/family to do the same.let me know if you go palm free!
1175 2018-11-26 22:15:43 Sooo last  century, oil & auto, if taxpayers are to help it must be not corporate but to retrain workforce - #CdnPoli
1176 2018-11-26 22:15:40 We are shouting because you can't eat gold or drink crude oil
1177 2018-11-26 22:15:40 He bought you a pipeline, for fuck's sake. And do you think a global supply glut and overproduction in the US might have something to do with the decline in the oil patch? Why do Albertans whine incessantly.
1178 2018-11-26 22:15:37 Lmao. Sorry, I can relate. Coconut oil doesn’t do stuff to my face tho, but if I eat any substandard groundnuts ehn, or wankyn stew they made with palm oil, my face go cast 
1179 2018-11-26 22:15:20 Most type 1 diabetics are low in B12/6. My Johns Hopkins, Chief of Endocrinology, put Me on wild salmon oil & sublingual B12/6 years ago. It eliminates My nerve pain, are antiinflammatory & help brain & heart also. I get mine at Trader Joe's but I also recommend Nature's Bounty.
1180 2018-11-26 22:15:14 Recession on the way.... oil prices are below $50...I quit my job today...here it comes, brace for impact!
1181 2018-11-26 22:15:13 I don't see how everyone avoids the elephant in the room which is that oil revenues are pathetic and we're wasting non-renewable resources for the profits of USA companies rather than leaving the oil in the ground and simply raising money with a PST from the debt slaves (us).
1182 2018-11-26 22:15:09 baked? :3 the laziness of the boiled ones and the sort of crispness of the fried ones.. also! less oil so its a healthy meal hehe
1183 2018-11-26 22:14:58 I hate gettin my oil changed they always tlkin bout something over due, like stfu and change my oil. Thanks
1184 2018-11-26 22:14:56 Oil?

1186 2018-11-26 22:14:52 They mixed it with mustard and some other shits like oil salt and idk what us
1187 2018-11-26 22:14:44 Shale is the big joke in the oil history, companies living from debts and banks
1188 2018-11-26 22:14:21 Ima get my boo to rub me down in some oil and massage me... I need it
1189 2018-11-26 22:14:14 I'm fillin' my Alfred Sung bootz with Medical Glue#4, Space Monkey,Blueberry and Black Seal Kush....a vial of pure dark 97%THC Indinca dominant pure cannabis oil I can only take only weekends #parentingwithmedicalmaryjane101 K$W we gotta link up I have producers, booking agents
1190 2018-11-26 22:14:11 What would happen if President Trump took a page out of R Reagan’s playbook when he invaded Granada. Go to Guatemala take over the country. Kill the drug cartels & run the country. Go into Venezuela take the oil and run the country. You would be screaming Dictator another Hitler.
1191 2018-11-26 22:14:07 CME RAISES CRUDE OIL FUTURE MARGIN TO $4100 FROM $3650

The CME margin hike game. Here's lots of leverage. Ooops. Too high. Hike!
1192 2018-11-26 22:14:04 I am more focused in katsu's hair *Sigh *.... whats his secret for that godly hair... is it a special made shampoo or a secret oil recip for hair cair... 
1193 2018-11-26 22:13:50 They're not 2 equal sides. There is the very huge truth based on science, and the pathetically tiny lie, based on the propaganda machines of big oil and coal. 99 marine biologists yell shark and one yells dolphin - are you jumping in the water?
1194 2018-11-26 22:13:46 After breaking a fan belt a few years ago I always put a new belt on when I change the oil filter.
1195 2018-11-26 22:13:42 please I already know how to edit oil painting effects on photos
1196 2018-11-26 22:13:33 IMO it's a hole with a very shallow bottom when we consider that stopping heavy oil production will mean that the end of most oil use is in sight.
1197 2018-11-26 22:13:32 Sometimes owning a Mercedes sucks 182.73 for a Fucc in oil change tuh
1198 2018-11-26 22:13:23 $75 for an oil change 
1199 2018-11-26 22:13:18 If healthy, his numbers still suggest he's a high-end WAR player, which makes that $23M well worth it. However, health is an issue but the risk is minimal on a one-year deal, other than the cash lol, and the payoff could be rather substantial for the Braves.
1200 2018-11-26 22:13:15 Naked with lashings of massage oil.
1201 2018-11-26 22:13:14 @realDonaldTrump on Jan 10 the incompetent @NicolasMaduro loses the last scent of democratic legitimacy. I ask you, Mr. President, to recognize the exiled government as the only legitimate authority and expel all diplomats appointed by him. You should consider a full oil embargo.
1202 2018-11-26 22:13:12 my daughter had it so bad, her head was literally scaley, and my mom got me Johnson's Baby Oil Gel (shea & cocoa butter) and I put it in her hair & let it sit all day for 3 days, and combed her hair like crazy and its almost completely gone! I hope this helps! 
1203 2018-11-26 22:13:11 An Alberta sales tax would go along way supporting the province ability to govern the oil patch
1204 2018-11-26 22:13:09 Is that oil deposits under the surface?
1205 2018-11-26 22:13:06 Oil exports are not getting a good return due to only having the US as a customer paying a reduced rate instead of the world rate thus the collapse of the Alberta economy that is happening. They can buy lots cheap but it is not helping the economy at those prices.
1206 2018-11-26 22:13:04 I always forget to clean out my car before I get an oil change and then the dudes look at me through the window and I know they’re like wow this dirty fuck how much Red Bull does this bitch drink
1207 2018-11-26 22:13:00 How about support for oil workers losing their homes and business due to your inaction.  Just empty platitudes. Useless. The East won't vote for you either this time unless you manage to rig the election. #resign
1208 2018-11-26 22:12:52 He will blame it on the fed and already has started. The fed has a very simple mandate of low unemployed and inflation. Good way to get a lot of inflation is to add 1.5 trillion in debt, start a trade war and also interfere with global oil markets causing instability.
1209 2018-11-26 22:12:49 食パンさん、おはようございます
1210 2018-11-26 22:12:45 I haven't got an oil change in a year and a month. Still got 2.5 k miles left.  i Don't F w/people man.

1214 2018-11-26 22:12:32 Told Cody I thought about doing a hair mask tonight, (I’ve been trying to grow my hair out) and so I get in the bath and Cody walks in whisking eggs and says “how much olive oil would you like in this for your hair babe?” ....A MAN. 
1215 2018-11-26 22:12:24 They must be made from that bloody oil

1217 2018-11-26 22:11:54 Oh grow up . The NDP inherited the oil crisis and has had many construction projects around Edmonton. Schools, hospitals, RCMP stations . Keeping many people working . Notley has certainly held her own . The Tories would never have done that !

1233 2018-11-26 22:10:10 Yes we need oil, but not at the point of putting pipes under or over rivers, that could be catastrophic to our drinking water, and  fracking is causing is causing every bee that helps pollinate our food, fly away

It's hard to buy that new $100,000.00 Cadillac Escalade when you just lost your job, because of a secret take down on oil.

1239 2018-11-26 22:09:55 It seems obvious that as a general matter cuts in supply and demand have to proceed in tandem. But for CA, why wouldn't we prefer to stop heavy oil production in favor of light oil imports?

1242 2018-11-26 22:09:49 What I am really curious about is whether these same USA corporations who benefit from our cheap oil were the ones who originally gave to the Tapcal Trust Fund and established a war chest for the PCs that kept them in dynasty spin mode for 44 years. Why doesn't @Alberta_UCP tell?

1249 2018-11-26 22:09:19 true but who eats palm oil to stay alive
1250 2018-11-26 22:09:18 You seriously think you have something to do with the price of oil? Oh, I know, it is your reward for letting the Saudis get away with murder.

1252 2018-11-26 22:09:11 Most of Canadian petroleum production is exported, approximately 482,525 cubic metres per day with almost all of the exports going to the United States. Canada is by far the largest single source of oil imports to the United States, providing 43% of US crude oil imports in 2015.

1259 2018-11-26 22:08:36 So, I used to go hiking with my alumni brothers when I lived in Palo Alto at the Stanford Villa

One of my Alumni brother was telling how he helped built the railroad parallel to the The Suez Canal, to carry oil across b/c Oil tanker ships were too big to cross

So I said, why

1261 2018-11-26 22:08:27 Stop the oil vs auto. This is the result of the business environment created by Team Trudeau. No pipelines screws the west. High power rates,taxes and having Dias with the NAFTA team did not help Oshawa's survival. May not have been the whole reason but it did not go unnoticed.

1263 2018-11-26 22:08:06 All bullshit aside Mr. Sohi, exactly what are you doing right now, today, to restore/stabilize our Oil & Gas industry?  How much has Alberta's equalization payments been reduced? I'll soon be asking which Province will be sending Alberta money. Or will ALL provinces be have-not?
1264 2018-11-26 22:07:52 Yup. But try to get the ordinary citizens to understand the ripoff and they all start screaming NEP, Trudeau senior, @JustinTrudeau like the trained seals they are. It is to the benefit of US corporations to get our oil cheap and have no access to tidewater. PCs captive to corps.
1265 2018-11-26 22:07:51 No, this is not why oil prices are falling. Has nothing to do with you. Educated peeps know that.

1278 2018-11-26 22:07:09 Also, the feds could announce that effective a certain date, they would stop importing Saudi oil into eastern Canada. That would send a powerful message to SA re: Murdering journalists has consequences, and give incentive to build EE.

1317 2018-11-26 22:04:08 Until 2015, I was a far leftist who thought the idea of ethical oil was a stupid one. That happened in part because I believed the nonsense spewed by mainstream academics and Unifor. I now know how wrong I was and stand behind our Canadian oil workers.

1323 2018-11-26 22:03:35 I dont think you know what you are talking about? What do you think we get from fracking? Oil or gas?
1324 2018-11-26 22:03:35 I'm really sad Green & Blacks have palm oil in some of their products. Divine are Fair Trade & Palm Oil Free. I've done some work with Fair Trade farmers and it really does make a difference - environmentally & humanly 
1325 2018-11-26 22:03:30 Yes at a higher world price instead of the US rate paid now on Canadian oil. Restriction to the BC coast from Alberta due to no pipelines means limited access to world oil prices on our domestic resource.
1326 2018-11-26 22:03:17 You don't see millions of years of sequestered carbon deep in the earth as oil and coal being burned in a few hundred years as not being responsible?  Use your head for something more than keeping your ears apart.
1327 2018-11-26 22:03:17 I don’t know if those oils are edible but of course there’s no reason why not. I was going to rub the bay oil on my arthritis! Meadowsweet smells of hay. I’ve made some balm with it, with beeswax.

1352 2018-11-26 22:01:36 Cast iron care doesn't get enough love. Only salt and oil for cleaning, anything else should have your iron taken from you.
1353 2018-11-26 22:01:28 Let's see... Billions of dollars in profits for oil and gas versus a few million, at most, for climate scientists? Jeez, when you put it like that! 

Hey, TXGaryM, yeah, follow that money trail...
1354 2018-11-26 22:01:25 #ung1102md WOW i can not believe that over half the oil from the BP oil spill is still in the ocean! That is shocking!!!

1357 2018-11-26 22:01:12 Classic problem of thinking you change politicians minds. Change happens by changing the people who rely on oil and gas industry for a living and vote for Ben Sasse.
1358 2018-11-26 22:01:06 What do you do for a living now?  Consultant for oil companies?  Any partisan views at all?
1359 2018-11-26 22:01:05 That shot should be in your best of Ukog  film one day
1360 2018-11-26 22:01:04 By the way, you don’t mention the Oil and Gas industry is booming on account exports of Nat Gas and Oil to the World, how about jobs saved by the Coal and Steel industry both neglected for 8 years. Does you Trump derangement prevents you from actually reading at all?
1361 2018-11-26 22:00:56 And when you say "displaced by socialist economic policies" do you mean Putin's war in Syria, Bush's oil war in Iraq, or maybe the CIA's game of musical despots in Central America??? Do you even know what socialism means? lol, well enough to spout nonsense about it on twitter?
1362 2018-11-26 22:00:55 Oh, the irony. A socialist republic sitting on one of the largest oil reserves begging for money.

1366 2018-11-26 22:00:47 Where's the "Dismantle the oil industry and guillotine the banksters" option?
1367 2018-11-26 22:00:44 Gutting to hear that @GM will be closing sites and ending some car model's due to poor sales and focusing on electric vehicles. Automobiles companies with in the US could have been build EV decade's ago but the government killed it due to deep oil pockets.
1368 2018-11-26 22:00:38 This is what we should do for coal miners. We should say ‘thank you’ for keeping the lights on for the last century and help them into the next century’s economy. Same with oil workers. I liked the lights on and I liked my Datsun 510’s. Americans dont fear the future.
1369 2018-11-26 22:00:38 Trudeau has deliberately put over 100,000 Alberta oil workers out of work. Ontario is now experiencing a little bit of what Alberta has experienced while the rest of the country stood by and cheered Trudeau on

1375 2018-11-26 22:00:25 I could question this, but don't disagree strongly. 1t of methane emitted in 1990 has quite a different impact than 25t CO2 emitted today, but we treat them as the same. I agree that a tonne of palm oil, for example, can be used to feed local people or burned as biofuel
1376 2018-11-26 22:00:19 November 26, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
1377 2018-11-26 22:00:15 A yeast infection soothing tip!  Make little footballs of coconut oil (if your body is ok with it) and freeze them. Pop one in before bed or just when hanging out. Be sure to wear a pad or something tho...

1379 2018-11-26 22:00:10 True or False: Changing the oil and filter can help an engine last longer.
1380 2018-11-26 22:00:08 If the only reason that climate scientists are warning about global warming is to make big money, the logic of the free market suggests that coal and oil companies would pay them more money to become climate deniers than liberal think tanks would pay them to issue dire warnings.
1381 2018-11-26 22:00:07 ask yourself why wally left saskatchewan an went to consulting for oil companies in Alberta if things in SK were so financially in shape ...  his actions speak very loudly ...
1382 2018-11-26 21:59:58 Kevin Hague’s latest graph of why oil costs Scotland money?
1383 2018-11-26 21:59:54 Well done! Maybe next week it will be our turn 
1384 2018-11-26 21:59:47 Wow I guess we all are starting to see what happens when you trust a snake oil salesmen. Autoworkers trusted Trump. Trumps tax break could bankrupt USA as most American corporations are greedy and most CEOs can careless about trickledown. Layoffs are coming after record profits
1385 2018-11-26 21:59:44 One woman was 35 weeks that I know, took castor oil to induce labor and ended up causing her baby to have a BM in the womb and it almost killed the baby. She said she was done being pregnant.... 
1386 2018-11-26 21:59:34 ...and in what way did you cause oil prices to fall?  Credit where credit is NOT
 due, clearly your mantra.

1392 2018-11-26 21:59:24 "Hosted by Chevron" in the bio 

This is literally an ad paid by big oil to try and shift the blame of climate change onto regular people with a cell phone (i.e., everyone) and away from their business practice that is unequivocally killing the planet.

Fuck you, Chevron.
1393 2018-11-26 21:59:18 Can anyone just make a political chart out of all the different takes on palm oil please
1394 2018-11-26 21:59:15 Remove the cunts in charge in the media. Break up these corporations. Didn't they do this to Standard oil
1395 2018-11-26 21:59:09 Dems won’t go to oil companies to get the money. They’ll go after u and me with a new TAX for using too much energy. In other words you will be limited to energy and u will have to pay credits if u  go over your allotted govt regulated  quantity. It’s another govt revenue scam!
1396 2018-11-26 21:59:05 Tell us why govt should use millions upon millions of tax payer money to support the tar sands. year after year & when ever their company's have slow down & low oil prices. All you CPC cry & scream for help in Alberta & get it. so just what is the difference.
1397 2018-11-26 21:58:55 @jkenney @RachelNotley @CPC_HQ @AndrewScheer Enough shut down oil in Canada, no more payment of transfer to Ottawa 4 million ppl are being ignored by @JustinTrudeau @liberal_party GM is not a crisis but our fed gov gives it more attention the an energy crisis... pathetic gov

1403 2018-11-26 21:58:33 To be fair, the OP was talking about foodbanks, poverty, the rape clause, bedroom tax, poll tax, Universal Credit and Tory rule.

None of which have anything to do with oil last I looked.

1405 2018-11-26 21:58:26 Trudeau liberal government isnt being reactive and trying to keep business here, for oil and Gas it is deliberately and maliciously working to destroy the industry. The spin off is other industries assume they will be next, but at least we have a CO2 tax and gender budget

Why so much chaos?

MSM is telling U bc of high gas prices ($7.15 per gallon).
How is this possible with low oil prices?
Simple answer: Their government just passed a crazy carbon tax.
 So much fo #GlobalWarming
1409 2018-11-26 21:58:11 Now we're cooking with peanut oil
1410 2018-11-26 21:58:10 But by that logic, Trump wanting a lower oil price would mean a lower dollar...

1414 2018-11-26 21:57:28 It’s all factual we just paid 5.4 billion on a dead pipeline that alone is a disaster lol unless he’s giving you billions and pumping oil which I doubt
1415 2018-11-26 21:57:19 White House rolls back fuel economy standards, pressures OPEC to keep oil prices low, relaxes emissions standards... and acts SHOCKED when US car manufacturers have to shutter passenger car & hybrid (Volt) production.
1416 2018-11-26 21:57:17 They blamed Obama too, now Republicans are dancing with Muslims thanking them for oil
1417 2018-11-26 21:57:11 The reality is that cars will be built, and around 100M barrels of oil will be sold globally today alone. The question Canada must ask in light of the above is "do we want to employ Canadians, and benefit our economy, or someone else's. I'm past the CC argument in 2018.

You didn’t do diddly squat for the Earth climate and you only listen to the big oil and fossil fuel companies because money is all you cared. Shame!
1423 2018-11-26 21:56:37 Trump in effect is saying that coddling KSA to keep oil markets stable is the most critical consideration. He’s lying, of course, to protect his & Kush’s personal monetary stakes with KSA. Fact is, they are in a position where the monarchy probably can’t survive w/o US support.
1424 2018-11-26 21:56:36 I think you just made yourself the bigger idiot. If a pipeline were started today it would be years before it's doing anything. Then there's that little thing about getting customers to buy thatvdirtu oil. Nope. Higher proc for oil is what matters now.

1430 2018-11-26 21:55:52 Hello Diana! If you are referring to Lucas Oil Racing TV, we suggest contacting Support@LucasOilRacing.TV.
1431 2018-11-26 21:55:36 You know Obama had us completely non dependent on foreign oil. You did this in less than 2 years?!! Isn’t it treason to sell out to our enemies?!
1432 2018-11-26 21:55:35 First time the oil and water has been topped up in my car since I bought it a year and a half ago and had to get my stepdad to do it for me Was driving with no oil or water for god knows how long lol
1433 2018-11-26 21:55:27 Cons, to be sure. But they hate Trump. They're Saskatchewan Cons. "Rah rah OIL! Trudeau is ruining the country! Suzuki is a crank! Global warming is a farce, and unions are for lazy assholes." And they're teetotalers. Something boozy is going to be in my coffee mug all day.
1434 2018-11-26 21:55:10 Lol, free me abeg.
1435 2018-11-26 21:55:07 Listening to the latest #JJHO and remembering how i felt like a terrible cad after running late for a flight, buying a subway sandwich the way i prefer (all the veggies and s&p and oil and vinegar) in the terminal then eating it on the plane.
1436 2018-11-26 21:55:02 How can they even finish 5L each of veg and palm oil? nah multitude feeding?
1437 2018-11-26 21:55:00 Nice. I haven't done any flavoured oil color a while. I feel the need to do it now. I've never used meadowsweet, what sort of flavour is it? Did you pick it wild?
1438 2018-11-26 21:54:58 This is where Albertans are very frustrated. Claiming Alberta oil should stay in the ground would be the equal to Alberta claiming that GM shutting down their plant in Oshawa today will be a good thing for the environment, as it would keep those cars off the road. (1)

1443 2018-11-26 21:54:24 Road to ruin, BC being led by an NDP/Green coalition who hate oil pipelines but hold a #proportionalrepresentation referendum without proper public consultation, in a desperate attempt to hang on to power. Just say NO.
1444 2018-11-26 21:54:15 But if we look at major game-changing innovations, most happened from within the public sector. See: the origin of the heavy oil industry in Canada, the internet, or the aviation industry.

1448 2018-11-26 21:53:56 I like the way you brought it back round to oil. That's where I joined this thread. Aye oil. We need to find a way to leave it where it is and stop burning it or we'll all die but in the meantime it's a tidy wee bonus for a brand new independent nation. 
1449 2018-11-26 21:53:56 That was pretty cool filming..."Core just got it "
well done.
1450 2018-11-26 21:53:55 Ultimately, economic activity drives the energy costs higher, not the other way around. But, high oil prices spur economic activity to come up with alternatives. At the end, these help with the growth as the lower the energy costs are, the more resources are available to growth.
1451 2018-11-26 21:53:53 Get rid of vehicles, stop using electricity and gas, no more ATM's, stop flying, no more rail travel, no more oil use, no computers, phones or tablets, no more machines, no more cooking or barbecuing, no more clothes or hair salons Etc. Lets go back to being dinosaur food, Idiots
1452 2018-11-26 21:53:43 There is no lack of refining capacity in North America or Alberta.  Refining more oil in Canada wouldn't help because we could get the refined product to consumers in Asia!!!
1453 2018-11-26 21:53:33 The theory where man's contribution of CO2 to the atmosphere coerces h2o to suddenly vaporize using low energy long wave radiation thereby causing h2o vapor to trap heat delivering a positive feedback.

Sorry, decades of observations show it isn't happening as planned.
1454 2018-11-26 21:53:32 Thank you so much 
1455 2018-11-26 21:53:20 If renewables were economically competitive with coal, oil, and natural gas everyone would be using them. The tech isn't there yet, and subsidies are a waste of taxpayer money. We need new technologies before renewables take the lead.
1456 2018-11-26 21:53:09 Thank you very much!
1457 2018-11-26 21:53:07 Sorry the oil prices dropped. Sorry that Albertans are suffering. The hate for Trudeau changes none of that.
1458 2018-11-26 21:52:59 Misstep of Trust
Filled with dread and uncertainty,
That you've thrown a match at oil,
And let the flames consume me,
While insisting it's water.
As you throw more fuel,
And don't understand,
Why it burns.

1470 2018-11-26 21:52:08 Tell me about it when i had an Infiniti Q45 it was $100 for oil changes  but I've never driven a better car, I loved that car. I'm looking at possibly getting a Mercedes next..
1471 2018-11-26 21:52:07 Oil prices rallied few months back then Nigeria "came out" of recession. Governors suddenly started paying salaries, foreign reserves started growing, inflation started dropping. Then Mr @MBuhari claimed the glory.
No all that happened because oil rallied! Simple.
1472 2018-11-26 21:52:06 Why do ppl feel the need to speed out of the parking lot of auto zone like cool new oil CARL.

1475 2018-11-26 21:51:38 My hair grows pretty fast without me doing anything specific for it. Basically I just wash it every other day and condition it. Sometimes I use oil in it. But I never straighten, curl, blowdry it because I have extremely thin hair and it breaks easily.
Hope it helps

1478 2018-11-26 21:51:22 So I was driving and my car suddenly stopped accelerating. I was going 30mph. The oil light, brake light and the "PS" light came on. I tried shifting my car into neutral and back, did nothing. I put the E brake up and back down did nothing. So I pulled over, turned it off then
1479 2018-11-26 21:51:20 Two olive, sesame, walnut, rapeseed. Also made some bay oil and some meadowsweet oil this year which smell amazing.
1480 2018-11-26 21:51:18 So you would remove 40% of the vegetable oil in the world and replace it with nothing?
1481 2018-11-26 21:51:13 Market Mover Update: The crude oil market got a respite today with Jan. WTI crude jumping to over $52/barrel.
1482 2018-11-26 21:51:07 Until the east decides they would rather buy Canadian oil instead of Saudi oil, I will be buying vehicles and everything else from the Americans that buy our oil
1483 2018-11-26 21:50:52 #Trudeauisaliar    Gov to give money to GM emloyees.. When is he going to help the oil and gas sector??? Thousands of workers in AB hungry..
1484 2018-11-26 21:50:49 When are you going to call Premier Notley and announce the same for oil&gas workers?
1485 2018-11-26 21:50:45 But isn’t it awesome that we’re the largest producer of energy:
#1 in total energy production
#1 in oil production
#1 in natural gas production
#1 in nuclear power
#1 in geothermal power
#1 in biofuels
#2 in wind power
#2 in solar power
#2 in coal production
#4 in hydropower

分かりましたか「私も～」って言って
書いてくれましたよ
　あっ、おいるさんおはよーございます！
1487 2018-11-26 21:50:35 The tattoo artist that’s gonna do my sternum smokes too so he said that he’s gonna let me hit his oil pen during the tattoo and if that ain’t extraordinary customer service then idk
1488 2018-11-26 21:50:29 BTW, I'll take this as a tongue-in-cheek admission that Hue Jackson is more of a snake oil selling politician than a coach, and you're more aware of that after 1-31 than even Baker was after 2-6-1.
1489 2018-11-26 21:50:18 Don’t tell them you’re disappointed. Tell them that sale of discounted Alberta oil to the US ends today and that all GM vehicles sold in Canada will be hit with a huge tariff from now on. Stand up for Canada and don’t let the Cheeto have his way.
1490 2018-11-26 21:50:17 Customer:I need to have my car Inspected I’m going on a long trip so it’s important
Me after inspection :ok your brakes are metal to metal, you have serveral oil leaks , tire tread Is 0mm and your windshield wipers are worn
Customer:ok I’ll get the wipers done thanks!

1491 2018-11-26 21:50:16 “Mais toi tu manifeste pour 10 centimes de gaz oil en plusss euhh ".   vous savez pas comment je rigole sur cette partie
1492 2018-11-26 21:50:05 Chazal don’t disagree. They made up the oil story because they knew how fucked up it is
1493 2018-11-26 21:49:48 just got my oil changed by myself, can relate
1494 2018-11-26 21:49:47 They weren’t false pretexts they where very legitimate. And it’s natural for there to be civilians in the crossfire. Also loving the oil, thanks.
1495 2018-11-26 21:49:46 Solid fuel vs oil heaters is tough; OH are moveable which is considerable advantage. However, most people don’t have multiple reception rooms, so it’s worth ‘ruggedising’ the room you mainly live in
1496 2018-11-26 21:49:46 Agreed. Baby oil is liquid parafine - a crude oil fraction = not good for pussies.
1497 2018-11-26 21:49:43 Wife: how much for an oil change?
Me: 50-100 depending on the oil, plus one humiliating lecture about how you're going to kill yourself driving around with your air filters and wipers in this condition
1498 2018-11-26 21:49:40 Good to know if I needed an oil change in the Jeep right now that my face alone could produce the 5 quarts needed real quick. #pdxtst #dry #ass #winter
1499 2018-11-26 21:49:28 If I can just see stew prepared with palm oil, locust beans, smoked fish and plenty of onions now ehn
1500 2018-11-26 21:49:27 It’s amazing how well a car runs once it finally gets an oil change how many hundred miles past due
1501 2018-11-26 21:49:23 cut them up into fries and pop them in the oven! you don’t need oil or anything if you use foil under them, and you can add curry or turmeric or cayenne pepper to season. plus the spices will help boost your metabolism
1502 2018-11-26 21:49:15 Yes but Saudi Arabia uses US dollars in business transactions and a lot of country’s  buy oil from Saudi which in turn boosts the price of the US dollar that is the only problem I can see with punishing them
1503 2018-11-26 21:49:13 warming up mustard oil with garlic to put in my dogs ear to ail his ear infection. desi remedies are the bestest
1504 2018-11-26 21:49:09 太るから?だから僕を突き放すの?オイルが嫌いなの?オイルに罪は無いだろう…?
1505 2018-11-26 21:48:55 Why do machanics always have the best playlists. Sitting here getting my oil changed being put on to new slaps
1506 2018-11-26 21:48:51 this picture just motivated to go massage oil into my eyebrows before sleeping bc wow @ those eyebrows
1507 2018-11-26 21:48:48 @AldiUK just wondering when  you're going to sell cookies that doesn't contain palm oil.
1508 2018-11-26 21:48:34 The simple definition of fracking? #Fracking allows companies to safely produce more oil and natural gas.
1509 2018-11-26 21:48:32 Looks like an oil chart. Lag between price and rig counts is about 12 to 18 months.
1510 2018-11-26 21:48:30 Do they have palm oil in?
1511 2018-11-26 21:48:27 Tea tree oil saves my life
1512 2018-11-26 21:48:24 It's not about that, it's about who can most efficiently produce a product.  Economics 101.  US produces oil efficiently.... and tades it for iPhones.
1513 2018-11-26 21:48:17 Is it wrong that I've just made an oil rig?
1514 2018-11-26 21:48:10 That would be inconvenient and  interfere with his oil deals
1515 2018-11-26 21:48:08 Next time you’re eating chick-fil-a remember that they cook with peanut oil, the peanut taste will not go away!!!
1516 2018-11-26 21:48:03 The SNP were supportive of GERS when oil was $140 per barrel. Changed their mind now the figures no longer add up.
1517 2018-11-26 21:47:59 $AMRN need to find more fish oil!
1518 2018-11-26 21:47:59 The thing is we produce more oil than they do
1519 2018-11-26 21:47:59 Oil industry in the hole, GM pulling out of Oshawa... Really missing @stephenharper. Unlike @JustinTrudeau he actually understands what makes an economy work. #cpc #StephenHarper
1520 2018-11-26 21:47:52 @SenTedCruz($505 K) @SenJohnBarrasso($413 K) @SpeakerRyan($392 K) @GOPLeader($338 K) @JohnCornyn($306 K) @SteveScalise($272 K). I guess you think these oil and gas contributions are more important than the health of the planet we leave to our children and grandchildren. Immoral!
1521 2018-11-26 21:47:52 It is true bro, but the Ghanaian economy didn’t grow at the level because the government of the day did anything special. Ghana’s economy was projected to grow at 8.3 percent due to the expansion in the oil and gas sectors in the recent past years.
1522 2018-11-26 21:47:49 Unless you’re Saudi and you give me money and I need your oil.
1523 2018-11-26 21:47:28 Yaaassss super simple!! I just seasoned it w salt, black pepper, onion and garlic powder, and olive oil and cooked on low for 8 hours and high for 2! FALLS OFF THE BONES
1524 2018-11-26 21:47:25 Stop using palm oil then I’ll eat your choc again
1525 2018-11-26 21:47:16 That is nonsense. Oil and gas, for obvious reasons, are very widely covered in Scottish media and the run-up till the 2014 vote was rather a boom time with high prices. That doesn't change the reality of a mature industry, global markets or, indeed, man-made global warming.
1526 2018-11-26 21:47:14 I read the diagram coal is in red and shows the reduction in emissions consistent with the reduction in consumption in 2014. Oil is in black and shows ongoing growth as in BP. My units of measure were Mtoe so carbon content and emissions potential surely the same for all fuels?
1527 2018-11-26 21:47:07 Scheer is an idiot but he or anyone just can't make the price of oil go up.
1528 2018-11-26 21:47:00 Guyana is not short of examples of poorly managed oil wealth and squandered opportunity. Nigeria is a case in point. In 2008, despite its wealth from oil and gas, Nigeria still had worse human development indicators than Papua New Guinea and Zimbabwe.
1529 2018-11-26 21:46:57 ive been using that entire range and its working pretty well for me, especially the tea tree oil
1530 2018-11-26 21:46:37 Haha! So true. Looking back, I wish I was recording an audio note for evidence, and then plan a performance art piece, playing the sound bites on a loop while I detangle my hair with coconut oil!
1531 2018-11-26 21:46:29 Exactly! I had to get edge control, the lil tooth brush, tea tree oil. Finna be laid from here to Abu Dhabi
1532 2018-11-26 21:46:22 They will face severe deflationary pressure throughout the downturn. Equities could fall 80%, junk down 50%, oil down to $10, metals sharply lower with gold down to $500. We haven't seen a deep deflationary downturn in 80 yrs. It's going to get ugly.
1533 2018-11-26 21:46:22 Such a fecking burden, when will the Shetlands just bugger off with the oil ? Then we can get back to the old firm score
1534 2018-11-26 21:46:11 Blake knows that my oil hasn’t been changed since I’ve had the car and he literally just had the audacity to ask me where my oil is at. like my dude, it’s at the store. 
1535 2018-11-26 21:46:09 Don't feed the troll.
1536 2018-11-26 21:45:59 HELP, HOW DO WE TURN THE BA BA'S  VOTE TO BLUE IN LOUISIANA, maybe tell them that there oil lines threw the bayou is killing the craw dadies, cre fish, mud bugs and shrimp and the environment. WILL OIL PROFITS WIN OVER
1537 2018-11-26 21:45:44 Try some oil of clove on your tooth.
1538 2018-11-26 21:45:40 seeing weeny Trump bowing down to murderer MSBs over 10% of our oil imports instead of taking steps to renewable energy independance pleases you this much?

1541 2018-11-26 21:45:29 This is hysterical foolishness not based at all in reality. Rage on somewhere else. I’m not buying the snake oil.
1542 2018-11-26 21:45:20 The family member that shames my sister and I for using cannabis/working in the industry LEGALLY just posted a meme about “pouring cbd oil” on her “entire life ” lmaoooo
1543 2018-11-26 21:45:19 Purely because he's been bought by the oil and gas industry (or should that be oligarchs?) who have no interest in the health of us or our planet, just their profits and their power over others. Selfish bastards!!!
1544 2018-11-26 21:45:18 The coverage it got was nowhere near commensurate with its newsworthiness. And the main media message was oil was running out. Really is a bummer when you're so biased you can't accept the mistruths that were told.
1545 2018-11-26 21:45:18 "Strong on the border" = Xenophobic and Racist despite not being a border state
"Supports conservative judges" = Wants to eliminate Civil Rights protections
"Supports limited government" = Owned by corporate interests and Big Oil

Lindsey... What does Putin have on you?

1546 2018-11-26 21:45:11 Petrol taxes have gone up.  Tax on diesel up over 15%.  Despite the oil price going down, everything in France gets more expensive.
1547 2018-11-26 21:45:04 The States are only interested in Alberta oil at cheap rates. Have to wonder how much  lobby money was spent to stop all others
1548 2018-11-26 21:45:03 Who made you like this?
1549 2018-11-26 21:45:00 Yep. Something that will help the oil & gas fatcats who are not happy with me either.
1550 2018-11-26 21:44:59 no shit, I was figuring $500 for brakes and an oil change! LOL
Silly me.
Well when I pull out of the lot everything will be new except the engine and tranny and these things last forever now-a-days.
Should be good for another 9 years.....I hope.
1551 2018-11-26 21:44:56 Great question! The Complete Engine Treatment, when added to oil, is designed for helping clean the oil system and won't raise the weight of the oil. Our Oil Stabilizer is meant to raise the weight of the oil and helps eliminate dry starts, and resist thermal breakdown.
1552 2018-11-26 21:44:48 Not as much as politicians who are in the pocket of the oil and gas industry, that I can tell you.
1553 2018-11-26 21:44:45 What if there are variables not being considered that are crucial to the answers but are discounted because they differ from conventional thought? This in itself could be catastrophic
1554 2018-11-26 21:44:40 How can we gat the stew track to spice up our one litre of oil, u just keep on shouting one litre, one litre@wizkidayo
1555 2018-11-26 21:44:39 The UK used it's oil revenues differently to Norway. That is why you dont pay a tenner to see a doctor (for example).
1556 2018-11-26 21:44:37 Hanukkah is a holiday about conserving oil and giving kids 8 presents. It is NOT about putting foreskins in the latkes. We do not put foreskins in the latkes. Please eat them, gentiles. Eat them all.
1557 2018-11-26 21:44:37 It is extremely important what they've done for this country and the battles and scares that came with it, but look how many senseless lives were lost,all in a ditch effort to bully other countries to get what our greedy governments wants, the control of the poppie fields and oil
1558 2018-11-26 21:44:34 views on coconut, olive and avocado oil ?!
1559 2018-11-26 21:44:25 I have five types of oil.
1560 2018-11-26 21:44:14 Sustainable palm oil is a myth.

You need to take a leaf out of @IcelandFoods book and go palm oil free. There's absolutely no need to be using it these days when there's so many other viable alternatives

1563 2018-11-26 21:44:02 Put coconut oil in my hair 2 nights ago and I woke up with dots on my forehead. Like can't you forgive me once??? Just once??
1564 2018-11-26 21:44:01 Wats wrong with all war stricken”fellow men” to bring the war in ur courtyard then they want revenge America Hav killed thr innocent families who had nothing to do with weapons of mass destruction America wanted to steal thr oil so they attacked a country on false pretences
1565 2018-11-26 21:44:00 Man! It's SO good! some olive oil and pinch of salt, voila! 
1566 2018-11-26 21:43:59 I'm in such a chill mood today that my tire pressure light AND oil change light came on and I don't even care
1567 2018-11-26 21:43:57 That necklace with those tits and oil....fuck 
1568 2018-11-26 21:43:57 Ons verwelkom die volgende uitstallers by die HKKF 2018:

Ons sien julle daar!
1569 2018-11-26 21:43:57 I presume your point is the oil fields weren’t secret because it was known they existed? But it was not WIDELY known about the extent of resources left there & in other as yet untapped fields. You & others ridiculed those who pointed this out. The extent of wealth was kept secret
1570 2018-11-26 21:43:41 He has destroyed the oil/gas industry, auto industry in Ottawa, next up agriculture? Proof 1 person can make a difference.
1571 2018-11-26 21:43:35 Al Gore isn’t in charge of climate science. His input is irrelevant
1572 2018-11-26 21:43:34 The secret is the investment in the oil and gas infrastructure in the past years. Indeed the IMF had projected Ghana to grow at 8.3 percent in 2018 but that didn’t come without some strict policies by IMF so let’s wait and see how we grow in the subsequent years.
1573 2018-11-26 21:43:32 um oil suppliers are restricting supply to bring prices back up. Yay Capitalism!
1574 2018-11-26 21:43:31 Lol. @JamesMartinSJ strictly limits his interviews to Stephen Colbert & mainstream journalists who'll provide him a safe platform for his heresy.
He'd sooner stick his head in an a vat of boiling oil than do an interview with an orthodox Catholic who'd challenge what he preaches.
1575 2018-11-26 21:43:29 Here we go again, the Saudis pumping oil at will. This time at record levels.
1576 2018-11-26 21:43:16 #COT = spec book for #oil as of 11/20/18, net long 367,187; change of 14,011 or 3.68% from prev. 381,198; 49.68% of 739,097 max on 2/6/18
1577 2018-11-26 21:43:12 omg ily thank u  Argan oil shampoo and conditioner; and then after I towel dry it coconut oil mist and argan oil again. Just a lot of oils  xx
1578 2018-11-26 21:43:01 Donny boy where is the middle tax cut you promised before midterms? There was no big tax cut for middle income and low income families. Only Corporations and the wealthy like yourself got a big cut. Heating oil & gas prices have gone up Donny boy. Food prices and rents way up!
1579 2018-11-26 21:42:49 GM - 3.5bil federal bailout. BBD 3.75bil federal subsidies. Alberta oil and gas producers 1.16bil annual federal subsidies. Federal = taxpayer.
1580 2018-11-26 21:42:49 Please do not give them the benefit of saying this was done in 'ignorance' because it wasn't.  We now know that Big Oil sat on this for at least 4 decades.  Those in power knew.  They just didn't care!
1581 2018-11-26 21:42:42 Impossible to say for sure, but seems like combination of crashing oil price; the strengthening dollar on expectations of tighter US monpol and simultaneously looser monetary policy in Europe and Japan; and burgeoning problems in China (also related to USD strength); other stuff?
1582 2018-11-26 21:42:40 You’re a lying, self serving wankstain and should shut your mouth. Your lies caused this. You’re a cheat. A snake oil salesman and should be ashamed of yourself.
1583 2018-11-26 21:42:35 The race is on between the US, Russia and China to control the world's last proven oil reserves. Peak Oil threatens economic collapse for everyone. If Iran ever gets a nuclear weapon, that would be a disaster for these powers,because it could make a military invasion of Iran hard
1584 2018-11-26 21:42:31 What oil fund have the UK ?

Oh yes. None.

It's all been squandered.

#DissolveTheUnion
1585 2018-11-26 21:42:26 It is awe full but when Saudi Arabia controls the worlds economy with its oil it is hard to punish them but I do agree some action should have been done
1586 2018-11-26 21:42:25 It's not what I want to believe, it's about truth.  Gore made up mind 30 yrs ago, based on what? Not 1 of his predictions is true. 
Scientific method demands THE MOST RIGOROUS tests that can be given. 
Consider following path IF these assumptions aren't true.
1587 2018-11-26 21:42:24 I agree. Oil collapse bazooka.
1588 2018-11-26 21:42:20 Oil of Ulay.50% of the time it works every time
1589 2018-11-26 21:42:07 Purchasing an oil pipeline to ensure oil reaches the coast sure is one hell of a way for the Liberals to kill the oil industry. 
Please, your constant misinformation campaign grows tiresome. If you’re going to criticize the PM, at least come up with some valid criticism.
1590 2018-11-26 21:42:00 We should put as much focus on planting trees and using hemp to make paper as these “global warming” nuts put on fearing carbon dioxide 

Trees need carbon dioxide to live and we need oxygen to live 
It’s a symbiotic relationship 

Stop destroying forests to make Toxic Palm Oil
1591 2018-11-26 21:41:58 If AAPL breaks 170, Oil tanks and DXY soars the Destiny Trade is back on.  Xi has until next week to make a move before another 25% rounds of tariff's.

1593 2018-11-26 21:41:52 I hope we find oil on Mars. That's why we're digging, right?
1594 2018-11-26 21:41:50 The hell is yours then. Oil riggers out of work? Or they go do same job for different source.
1595 2018-11-26 21:41:50 もえちゃんのサインも...(^-^)
1596 2018-11-26 21:41:44 Hopefully I get off early enough from work so I can do my oil change for the E30 
1597 2018-11-26 21:41:34 Revenue Commissioner Fisher says state's now expecting a surplus in its budget next year even if oil for the year averages $70 (they're forecasting a $76 average). #akleg
1598 2018-11-26 21:41:34 Also did a batch by dissolving beeswax in pure turpentine first. Have seen recipes where boiled linseed oil is added instead of mineral oil.
1599 2018-11-26 21:41:33 Motor oil on waffles >> motor oil on pancakes.
1600 2018-11-26 21:41:27 Thank you Canada for the 40% of the oil imports Americans receive from your great country. Who needs the 9% we import from the murderer’s in Saudi Arabia.
1601 2018-11-26 21:41:15 I have noticed over several years oil prices drop just before an election.  After the new year it’ll go back up to around 100.00 per barrel +  - a few bucks.
1602 2018-11-26 21:41:09 One more reason Scotland want's out of this corrupt Union. What are they doing, in Westminster,  with our Oil Money? They've robbed the WASPI Women of their pensions and the rest of us get the lowest pensions in Europe

How is that possible in the 2nd richest country in Europe?
1603 2018-11-26 21:41:02 I think a cab driver used my company credit card to buy $100 meals at a chicken shop, getting an oil change, a ps4, and charging $1500 for the 10 min cab ride.

I know it's Thanksgiving and times are tough, but really man??  Why couldn't he at least try to be a little discreet?
1604 2018-11-26 21:40:58 Need more work and policy recommendations on agglomeration shadows.  Otherwise politicos are being sold snake oil.
1605 2018-11-26 21:40:55 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Los Angeles sleeps.
1606 2018-11-26 21:40:55 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Dallas sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
1607 2018-11-26 21:40:45 Like electric car and residential solar. I pay $0.00 to refill over night and don’t even go to gas stations, oil changes nor smog checks.
1608 2018-11-26 21:40:40 Hey @realDonaldTrump - I just paid over $4/gal for gas.  AGAIN.  Tell us more about how aiding and embedding criminals in Saudi Arabia is helping our oil crisis.
1609 2018-11-26 21:40:39 So one of the most important things you can get out of this video is that oil is a finite and non-renewable resource, there are limited reserves, and production cannot keep up with demand, therefore something called "Peak Oil" will be reached. This will cause economic collapse.
1610 2018-11-26 21:40:36 LOL Please enjoy your burnt offering alone. Do you need palm oil?
1611 2018-11-26 21:40:33 oil has a little bit more downside. WTI 47,5 lets say for now.
1612 2018-11-26 21:40:32 I was crying my eyes out, as one does, when I realized that I'd forgetten I'd put castor oil on my lashes. Now my eyes burn like a bitch
1613 2018-11-26 21:40:30 Gee the oil industry has been in Alberta for generations It has history here What will happen to all those people that have lost their jobs? The cold hard facts is many of them are or only a step away from bankruptcy Many are now accessing social programs to survive
1614 2018-11-26 21:40:19 Does it ever stop? lol Mad times!! Whoop!
1615 2018-11-26 21:40:08 ブレーキランプ5回点滅、ごま油のサイン。
1616 2018-11-26 21:40:03 So you’re saying our economy will be worse off with improved infrastructure, lower dependency on foreign oil, and cheaper utility bills for families?
1617 2018-11-26 21:39:55 This man must be drinking to much of his own products. He hasn’t a scoopy doo on this issue another than promoting his own product. Please get someone sensible who has a real understanding. We’ve had enough of charlatans on Brexit selling snake oil.
1618 2018-11-26 21:39:53 やべ～電車の中で寝そう
1619 2018-11-26 21:39:52 studies confirm that that once 45 cries about #CNN being unfair, a sad wolf whispers #covfefe
1620 2018-11-26 21:39:52 I saw that oil was over $50 per barrel today. 
Canada is being robbed of over $40 per barrel by the Money Mafia/World Bankers/NWO to prop themselves up after having their cash flow cut across the World.
1621 2018-11-26 21:39:44 Would u sell chapstick at a "lipstick oil company" idk man real entrepreneur
1622 2018-11-26 21:39:33 Just what we need, another person against a #GreenNewDeal, #M4A and for the banksters, oil and pharma.

Yay. I guess
1623 2018-11-26 21:39:30 You know Bush Sr and Bin Laden's brother set up an oil business together in the 70's Arbusto Energy)?

Should the Bush family be chopped up with a bone saw then?
1624 2018-11-26 21:39:28 We have our own oil and gold.
How much of Iran's oil did we get, eh?
1625 2018-11-26 21:39:22 zack thought he bought massage oil until we used it then he read foaming bubble bath on the bottle  I have soap all over my back
1626 2018-11-26 21:39:01 Eucalyptus oil bby like 1 drop
1627 2018-11-26 21:38:58 And the oil pops stop bothering me years ago. Y’all just weak.
1628 2018-11-26 21:38:48 Cbd oil works wonders, gets out receptors firing away 

Your dog almost has the same eyes as me, mine a little lighter a greener though . Gold orange in the sun though haha
1629 2018-11-26 21:38:43 I love getting my oil changed at the end of the day when the service side about to close. The wait is never that long.
1630 2018-11-26 21:38:43 The fricking repubs need to stand up to Trump n big money oil , coal, factories, etc. Unsanitary irrigation water causing illness The EPA has cut regs n caused tremendous harm! Rein in pollution! Rejoin the world on Paris Clinate Agreement, all for starters!
1631 2018-11-26 21:38:41 Plunging oil prices once again threaten to force American shale drillers to pull back on production, just as they were preparing to unleash a flood of crude.
1632 2018-11-26 21:38:38 these are surprisingly so. give 'em a layer of mink oil every 6-8 months or so

1635 2018-11-26 21:38:26 Being financially stable is not feeling like you have to vomit when you pay $95 to get your oil changed. Life is good.
1636 2018-11-26 21:38:14 Honestly we can only look at the economy and see if it's working. I'd love to see investment in alberta for renewables. GM leaving ont makes room for a solar plant etc. There's idea for the future if we want them. Oil is finite. won't last forever.
1637 2018-11-26 21:38:08 I melt wax over a jug of boiling water, think melting point of pure beeswax is 75°c, then add to mineral oil. More oil makes it a paste, more wax and it will harden after cooling.
1638 2018-11-26 21:37:59 As well as allowing more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere trump’s also loosening standards for how to discard coal ash, despite it spilling into waterways!
freezing mandates on cars to pollute less, cutting limits on methane gas released by the oil industry....
1639 2018-11-26 21:37:52 Ste needs to let me know which brand of baby oil he wants for keeping his bonce shiny  promised I'd bring it Saturday for him. Keepers may not be able to hold his headers then 
1640 2018-11-26 21:37:48 in high school I sent away for a Milk Magazine CD of Dismemberment Plan covering "This Christmas" & Alkaline Trio doing an acoustic "Snake Oil Tanker" (it mentions Christmas but really isn't a Christmas song) & they mailed it to me in a regular manila envelope w/o cardboard
1641 2018-11-26 21:37:48 Does anybody know where in town I can buy 100% Lemon Oil for my diffuser?
1642 2018-11-26 21:37:42 Can someone link me to a small business that makes tea tree oil face serums? My most favorite one from The Body Shop isn’t made anymore :(

1644 2018-11-26 21:37:33 Saudis pumping oil at historically record levels and oil is up 2%...hmmm.
1645 2018-11-26 21:37:30 Selling coconut oil online...
1646 2018-11-26 21:37:27 Olive oil, the gateway to extra virgin oil. Fact.

1649 2018-11-26 21:37:13 Yeah badly managed tax regime. But feel free to compare the same fiscal period with Norway's oil revenue. 
Thanks for help make the case for independence btw.
1650 2018-11-26 21:37:11 I hear we get to pay full world price for their (Saudi) oil too.   Brings up the point, what kind of a total mental midget would let his country sell oil at a HUGE discount, while buying it at world prices?  
+  = Justin Trudeau 
1651 2018-11-26 21:37:07 He is the one who got our country to produce more oil. Obama ppl believed we should be paying 5 dollars a gallon to cut supply use. Trump is M.A.G.A.
1652 2018-11-26 21:36:59 Alternate Tylenol and ibuprofen. Stick with your antibiotics. Use some tea tree oil straight from bottle between the tooth and gum. Try a heating pad on low. I’m the queen of toothaches. I’m so sorry.
1653 2018-11-26 21:36:56 Ppl who hate on sex workers for “getting free money” are clearly just mad they have chapped lips, split ends, and are overdue for an oil change ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
1654 2018-11-26 21:36:46 Wow, you're really rewriting the 2014 pre referendum narrative here... The Claire Field find was hushed up and kept out of the news, while we were told oil would run out in five years. You need to take a step back and look again at this one... Soc Media makes you ACCOUNTABLE.
1655 2018-11-26 21:36:42 sniff snorf ah yes i love the smell of oil and machines
1656 2018-11-26 21:36:38 Shutting down the oil sands. Shutting down the auto industry. Soon enough all major employers will close their doors and your CO2 emissions will be achieved.

1659 2018-11-26 21:36:20 It’s such a great story...

A plucky band of billionaire oil execs standing off against thousands of scientists from across the world.

It’s like a Hallmark special!
1660 2018-11-26 21:36:20 Was it all from the oil price crash basically?
1661 2018-11-26 21:36:18 The same article as I referenced in my 11/14 tweet. Same unrealistic methodology/conclusions. As I mentioned then, modeling doesn’t work well for global oil markets, which are v inelastic, ruled by mercantilism & geopolitics - and most recently the phenomenal growth from fracking

1665 2018-11-26 21:36:09 Oil production depends heavily on supply and demand and from effective next month Saudi Aramco along with Russia will reduce the output one million barrel daily in the wake of high supply and low demand .
1666 2018-11-26 21:36:08 Similar to linking Marie Curie to nuclear fission. I'm talking about meaningful data sets that explain/ prove current assumptions.
This ain't it

1668 2018-11-26 21:36:02 The only reason I was even put on plaquenil was to prevent neonatal lupus in a hypothetical baby I have no intention of EVER having. Rheum didn't give a shit how my lupus affected me. Still have pain and fatigue? Try fucking turmeric and fish oil. Wish I was joking.
1669 2018-11-26 21:35:56 No I disagree . I use to be married to a nurse. She needs oil and petrol in her car to get to the hospital to look after very ill patients. No way could she afford an expensive electric car.

1671 2018-11-26 21:35:52 Today, America starts drilling on Mars. NASA claims it's to get data on the center, but word persists they're hoping to strike oil, thus securing endless funding from Congress.
1672 2018-11-26 21:35:35 You won't see growth in shale with oil under $55.

1682 2018-11-26 21:34:49 It's my pleasure to help, I can only imagine what the family is going through now... I also offered to treat Aiden with @GreenReliefLP oil at no charge, they can take me up on that anytime.
1683 2018-11-26 21:34:47 Yesterday I made my own mustache wax using coconut oil and beeswax I had refined myself. This puts me uncomfortably dead center between the quad Venn of homesteader blog & men's grooming blog, hipster & hippy. DIY is a slippery slope
1684 2018-11-26 21:34:46 Now that everyone knows its shaving cream instead of whipped cream, motor oil instead of syrup and sheets of cardboard in between the pancakes the world is never going to be the same again.

1696 2018-11-26 21:33:35 1000's of oilfield jobs will be lost! Oil Co's cannot operate/produce w/low prices. We have ppl from all 50states here in W.TX working in oil&gas, it's coming to a screeching halt, tax revenue will decrease when they are again unemployed!
1697 2018-11-26 21:33:32 hahaha yes, that is absolutely true. it's just weird because i guess i always thought i was one of the rich ppl and it turns out i'm not!!!!!!! especially when half the ppl in my program are funded by oil money

1703 2018-11-26 21:33:09 Yes, we should disparage people who spread fake news. Note; as somebody new to Scottish politics, be aware that the main pro-Yes parties take rather a hard line on this kind of bullshit. The secret oil field nonsense was not advanced by the SNP or Scottish Greens.

1741 2018-11-26 21:30:19 In all fairness there’s a new company (Tesla) that’s ramping up production. Detroit just fell asleep with its little quaint arrangement they had with the Oil & Gas Industry and didn’t innovate..
1742 2018-11-26 21:30:16 おはよう。二度寝したら追いオリーブだぞ。
1743 2018-11-26 21:30:15 I keep an extra deck of crushball behind my medicine cupboard in case i ever need them when im sick... i won 50,000 of a bet and raunched it all as fast as i could on cough medicine, sprite, vape oil and amber leaf.. all my stackies on wacky backy
1744 2018-11-26 21:30:14 You Cons forgot to build pipelines. That's why Alberta can't export its oil beyond the US.
1745 2018-11-26 21:30:12 救いたい。救えない。どうしようもできないなら助けを求める声は聞かない方がいい。耳を塞ぐ。だが聞かないこと自体が裏切りであり悪なことは変わりがない。全部俺が悪い。ごめんなさい。
1746 2018-11-26 21:30:03 Avocado oil is a healthy alternative to vegetable oils. Avocado oil is rich in monounsaturated fats like olive oil, but it is stable at h...
1747 2018-11-26 21:29:59 Just don’t drive it with insufficient oil in the engine. Or, finished engine.
1748 2018-11-26 21:29:35 As well batteries need to be charged and if the source is still oil or gas or worse coal then what has been improved?
1749 2018-11-26 21:29:33 There is nothing in it for the US. It's not like Ukraine has oil
1750 2018-11-26 21:29:32 Also, remember while fueling up those cars, oil & gas producing, Alberta has lost 10s of thousands of jobs, yet we still by oil from the Middle East because pipelines....
1751 2018-11-26 21:29:31 If y'all let. Wait. Y'all elected a financially & morally bankrupt snake oil conman ruin the world. OMG
1752 2018-11-26 21:29:25 Yall need to get an oil change and tune up on that high mileage pussy. Stop blaming men for everything.
1753 2018-11-26 21:29:23 $450 for 150 gallons of heating oil = #Ouch
1754 2018-11-26 21:29:13 ‘Bacon’!

… Or, chicken skin and fat slowly being reduced.

EDM marinated it in mustard, paprika, oregano, salt, and olive oil.
1755 2018-11-26 21:29:03 ‘Tis nice with a nice grilled chunk of my flesh with a drizzle of oil and lemon, my child
1756 2018-11-26 21:29:02 It’s funny how science is the greatest thing when it’s saving your ass in the hospital or keeping your tires from exploding but BS when it contradicts what you want to believe.
1757 2018-11-26 21:29:02 Oil
1758 2018-11-26 21:28:50 have yourself a very merry Dismembermas
let your hearts be light
from now on the oil will flow like red blood bright.
1759 2018-11-26 21:28:48 Oil *process*ing. :P
1760 2018-11-26 21:28:48 HEDGE FUNDS RAISE US CRUDE OIL NET LONGS FIRST TIME SINCE SEPT-CFTC :RTRS #WTI
1761 2018-11-26 21:28:45 Natural gas is mined in exactly same manner as oil also is very pollutive as well
1762 2018-11-26 21:28:34 I'll try, but I'm just so jealous of all the gas, crude oil petrochemicals, textiles and cotton fiber that they have!
1763 2018-11-26 21:28:33 I would still ban palm oil it's a modern day scourge and unnecessary
1764 2018-11-26 21:28:30 I am using cbd oil and having great results..please try it if hurting ..I can't stand the thoughts that people hurt..I have done too much of that..don't want it for anyone
1765 2018-11-26 21:28:30 I need to get an oil change today but I don’t wanna drive to dealership to get one 
1766 2018-11-26 21:28:21 Use an oil brush for thé grass
1767 2018-11-26 21:28:12 Maybe they can make train cars to move stranded Canadian oil?
1768 2018-11-26 21:28:08 Germany get 90% of its oil and gas from Russia. Only Germany can do something meaningful about this. Freeland has to tell Germany to start buying Canadian or Canada has to stop importing BMWs and Mercedes.
1769 2018-11-26 21:28:07 Why if yoh find Gold, Diamonds, or Oil it's government property but if you find drugs they say that belongs to you
1770 2018-11-26 21:28:05 Literally Thousands of direct or indirect good paying jobs including mine we’re lost in Alberta during the oil down turn and still continues 2-3 years later , but yet less then half of the out rage or federal support !!!
1771 2018-11-26 21:27:48 Put some cuticle oil in there too. 
1772 2018-11-26 21:27:31 Canada will gladly sell you natural gas, oil, gasoline and diesel fuel  haven’t you heard ... “WE’RE OPEN FOR BUSINESS” @JustinTrudeau @fordnation @AndreaHorwath @AndrewScheer
1773 2018-11-26 21:27:28 I need an oil change 
1774 2018-11-26 21:27:15 Ajam=chicken! The green beans are boiled in water like 13min. Than you take the water out. Beans also! Same pan- little oil/ butter sliced onions and softly glace them, put back the beans and mix it, now you put in the santen, that's coconut creme with water. A nice layer of it.
1775 2018-11-26 21:27:14 3k auto workers to be laid off, big noise. 60k oil workers out of work no noise.
1776 2018-11-26 21:26:58 That is history. How many royal families have inter we'd to expand the empire? Even Rome. They welcomed every conquered royal into the empire as long as they paid tax. Same with the Greeks. Stalin made treaty with Hitler. Of course Hitler wanted oil from Russia. Elites = Tyranny
1777 2018-11-26 21:26:51 What’s the best oil for a beard?
1778 2018-11-26 21:26:47 Please try cbd oil..it helps
1779 2018-11-26 21:26:36 I love how liberals pretend they don’t use oil
1780 2018-11-26 21:26:32 I wonder how much of an impact @Tesla had on the glut and of oil prices dropping. The closing of ice plants as well as car companies increased development of EV’s. Like a pebble dropped in the ocean @Teslarati @teslaliving @elonmusk
1781 2018-11-26 21:26:26 My ears blocked up with flu & I used Olbas Oil to loosen the gunk & it was one of the most painful things ever.
1782 2018-11-26 21:26:17 Tears. Or avedas hair oil lol
1783 2018-11-26 21:26:13 You've just proved Seans point inflion was 16% or in current day prices 11.5%.

Edward Heath and Anthony Baber is Chancellor introduced wage price policy when every economist and Labour told the Tories not to.

Secondly. 1973, OPEC introduced the Oil embargo and cut the supply.
1784 2018-11-26 21:26:12 Come with shayo
1785 2018-11-26 21:26:10 They’re always raw at salad bars and I wondered about that.  They are much better cooked with a bit of olive oil.
1786 2018-11-26 21:26:06 Clay face mask, sugar & coconut oil lip scrub, emails sent, to-do lists updated. It’s a good Monday . 
1787 2018-11-26 21:26:05 Smh left the house looking Fresh af andI have to run out of oil the world needs to see my fit

1791 2018-11-26 21:25:54 Hang on. I wasn't aware palm oil was a recommended wank enabler. But I suppose the clue's in the name.
1792 2018-11-26 21:25:50 Where do I get tea tree oil
1793 2018-11-26 21:25:46 Just like you are helping Alberta oil workers?
#clown
1794 2018-11-26 21:25:42 えみや理論やめい。
1795 2018-11-26 21:25:40 look into simple coconut oil.  It does amazing things for your teeth and gums.  Helps to fight infection.  I brush and swish with it every day...spit it in the toilet so that you do not clog your sink!  multi use, I wash my face with it also.
1796 2018-11-26 21:25:25 Men and football
1797 2018-11-26 21:25:22 I've been taking evening primrose oil for nearly 20 years. I occasionally get a hot head, but that's all and they didn't start until I was 55. My doctor said she wished more women would take it.
1798 2018-11-26 21:25:14 This is also against the Geneva Conventions. We are NOT to gas or poison REFUGEES! We are not even permitted to do these things to POW's and we're doing it to children and babies! trump wants into Venezuela for their oil. This is the beginning, South America is the start, watch
1799 2018-11-26 21:25:05 Yes! It Harsh,far right regime. Women must wear burkas, cannot work, cannot drive alone. The list goes on. Antithetical to everything for which America stands. We don't need them anymore. We produce lots of oil, import 40% of oil from CANADA and 9% from Saudi Arabia. So?
1800 2018-11-26 21:25:02 Just add an oil or strobe cream to your current matte foundation
1801 2018-11-26 21:24:59 Take CBD oil full stop 
1802 2018-11-26 21:24:57 Let's talk about the environment & how nothing positive is being done to protect western lands from coal mines & oil drilling. Why can't you do something about that? When the Dems take the House, maybe they'll listen.
1803 2018-11-26 21:24:56 People marching for doubling min wage have no concept of inflation, increases in taxes they would enjoy as a result. Gov education only transfers approved knowledge
1804 2018-11-26 21:24:53 It has been 40+ years MOST of those dinosaurs have been here the whole time in the pocket of Oil companies...GTFO with this ageist BS. They are bought. It is not an age thing...it is a complicity thing. Climate is not a new issue.
1805 2018-11-26 21:24:35 Blow up oil rigs with me
1806 2018-11-26 21:24:30 NO NO NO NO NO NO NO - Thank you OIL and GAS industry for pumping TOO MUCH oil and making it cheap. Thinking Trump is like thanking Jesus... Jesus is not in the oil business.
1807 2018-11-26 21:24:24 Geez louise. People have too much time on their hands ffs. I guess reality is too much for some people. Mix that with snake oil salesmanship and hucksterism being trendy af.
1808 2018-11-26 21:24:18 an armistice.  So no real interregional cooperation and development, constant competition for water, fuel, etc.  And the US tolerated it because it needed the oil.
But now the US doesn't need the oil, the Arabs need the US to stave off Iran and its proxies, and the incentives->

1810 2018-11-26 21:24:09 “Hedge funds have more than tripled their bets against the #oil price since the beginning of October, amassing the largest short position against crude in more than a year as prices have tumbled.”

1813 2018-11-26 21:23:43 NO NO NO NO NO NO NO !!!!!!!! - Thank you OIL and GAS industry for pumping TOO MUCH oil and making it cheap. Thanking Trump is like thanking Jesus... Jesus is not in the oil business.
1814 2018-11-26 21:23:40 You ever just chug a thing of extra virgin olive oil
1815 2018-11-26 21:23:39 And when America falls irretrievably behind in the renewable energy market because of Trump’s fixation on coal & oil - we’ll see more & deeper job losses
1816 2018-11-26 21:23:35 Am I missing a trick? Overheard a student saying they are buying a Danny DeVito oil painting for their boyfriend for Xmas. The lads were all like: class. What.
1817 2018-11-26 21:23:34 Will they be shiny? Like they were just rubbed with olive oil shiny?

1821 2018-11-26 21:23:03 i loveeeeee body oil. the oil man on Georgia Ave. make sure he got pink pussy for me every single time.
1822 2018-11-26 21:22:59 Three years of Trudeau. No pipelines, oil crisis in Alberta, manufacturing crisis in Ontario, foreign policy disasters...he sure as hell wasn't ready and will never be ready. He needs to go. Never vote Liberal.
1823 2018-11-26 21:22:42 @LancasterToyota The service is absolutely TERRIBLE. I dropped my car off at 8:40 am & was told it would be done at 4 (simple oil change/tire rotation). I called at 4, and it was just being worked on - plus they had some recommendations (as they always do - money makers).
1824 2018-11-26 21:22:24 I’m living not existing. My relationship with the Most High is improving, health is superb, my skins covered in Coconut Oil with a little bit of Jergens Nourishing Honey. Anything tryna disrupt my Black Boy Joy is clipped.
1825 2018-11-26 21:22:21 You are a oil heating engineer not Shakespeare comrade . 
1826 2018-11-26 21:22:20 I hadnt smoked for 3 days once. At first you drop into some sort of false sense of security.. but then you start to sweat cold nicotine oil at night and cant stop dreaming of finding 50p and sprinting to Tels for a 20 deck. I was over the craving so i started smoking again ASAP.
1827 2018-11-26 21:22:16 腹壊して控えめに言って死
1828 2018-11-26 21:22:06 So GM announced layoffs and closures, Bombardier announce layoffs and oil & gas producers along with service companies in Alberta looking out side of Canada for investment. When will our federal government realize they need to change their tactics for investment here?
1829 2018-11-26 21:22:01 What’s Tom Delay’s current job?  Mouthpiece for oil interests?  Maybe he should not call the kettle black.
1830 2018-11-26 21:22:00 But they were built for the Pacific
1831 2018-11-26 21:21:59 Fried in coconut oil is quite the treat with a couple lightly scrambled eggs 
1832 2018-11-26 21:21:58 why does everyone keep referring to syrup as motor oil?
1833 2018-11-26 21:21:56 a farmer in Estonia sledgehammers into the wall of a run-down barn. a terrified squeaking and the hot bite of corn oil all but lay him out. stunned, he peers into the hole...
1834 2018-11-26 21:21:53 And we all know Government is infallible.  The people in it, researchers submitting data, and the funding of it are all done by independent nonpartisan individuals with 0 self interest.
1835 2018-11-26 21:21:47 @elonmusk could you hurry up UK production of model 3’s? My oil burner is getting abit old and I really dont want to have to find an interim car .
1836 2018-11-26 21:21:46 Cbd oil 
1837 2018-11-26 21:21:32 Baby oil works a treat...
1838 2018-11-26 21:21:31 When the boys were little I’d get on my hands & knees with the vinegar (I put a drop or 2 of peppermint oil in it so it wasn’t so icky) scrubbing the floors, cabinets, everything 

Now? Pfft
1839 2018-11-26 21:21:27 Yah... that.s abt right, but because of the odd closing times of Oil mrkts vs the stock mrkt last Thanksgiving Friday, the corresponding gain/loss was out of sync.
1840 2018-11-26 21:21:27 Oil is at $40/barrel but no help is promised those families? Are families in AB, BC, SASK not as much a part of the confederation as ON?
1841 2018-11-26 21:21:22 Nigerians wee buy a car and go and launch it in church, pastor wee na pour olive oil(annointing oil) inside the engine... 
1842 2018-11-26 21:21:16 I bought this on Ocado and see it has palm oil in it - is this sustainably grown and can you give the detail on this?
1843 2018-11-26 21:21:14 ...and Saudi Arabia, the country whose people perpetrated the attack? Oh, right. The oil.
1844 2018-11-26 21:21:11 I agree one of the strongest charts on aim that isn't oil and gas
1845 2018-11-26 21:21:02 Infrastructure that wasn't developed in the past three years plus, can't be developed with few months. Please baba you don try just leave Nigeria make another person try. I don't even understand why you are suddenly so concerned about Nigeria as if she were an oil well
1846 2018-11-26 21:20:54 They use motor oil as syrup in commercials because pancakes and stuff can’t absorb it making it look neater and nicer
1847 2018-11-26 21:20:49 When the Saudis stop flooding the market with oil to avoid ramifications for murder or emission standards go back up, car manufacturers are going to be in trouble
1848 2018-11-26 21:20:43 CBD oil may help, it's legal and you can't get high from it. There are lots of brands.I have some (organic) though I haven't tried it yet. You need to research it to decide whether it may be of help.
1849 2018-11-26 21:20:40 The oil is indeed running out. There is no dispute about that. There is debate about whether we should burn remaining reserves (for the sake of our climate), most notably within Yes movt. There is no debate about the reality of a mature resource and no credible claim of cover-up.
1850 2018-11-26 21:20:38 They got a video of all the commercial cheats they do to make food look better and motor oil as syrup is one of em
1851 2018-11-26 21:20:38 As long as you go home with a live ram  and a jar of Sunflower oil , then whatever humiliation the 83k brings was worth it.

But if it is just a few glasses of wine and a flimsy plate of overpriced food, then ah ah you are not alright oooo

1855 2018-11-26 21:20:28 better yet, sue Big Oil, which has known about Climate Change since mid-1960's. Their response has been to deny it, to cast doubt about the science behind it, to confuse the public about the issue. They are basically doing what Big Tobacco did, only this time it affects all of us
1856 2018-11-26 21:20:27 Haha that's how it feels! Like a constant bombardment of oil ads!
1857 2018-11-26 21:20:23 Alright foxy you ask for it Mangle stand back gets a bucket of oil
1858 2018-11-26 21:20:22 Late news sorry. I’m about to travel. A Daesh raid was foiled before they reached Tanak oil field. A handful of Daesh dead and 2 motorcycles were destroyed.

1864 2018-11-26 21:20:04 Threw in chopped dhania, onions, tomatoes, chilies, mustard oil, salt and chaat masala in a food processor and ran it till it was sufficiently blended out that’s it.
1865 2018-11-26 21:19:49 The Italian in me knows that this serving is for a 4-6 month old in Italian food training. For the rest of us we are wondering where is the Giardiniera, Melenzana ali oilio, the left over rapini from last night in oil with a bit of pecorino romano, plus the red wine and crumbs?
1866 2018-11-26 21:19:34 If that were the only factor Alberta oil would not be selling at an 75% discount.

1874 2018-11-26 21:18:28 1) Sorry people are loosing jobs, but it’s time to stop asking the government to bailout the oil industry to save jobs. Ask them to invest in retraining, developing a green economy and moving us into the future. #BigOil #climatechange
1875 2018-11-26 21:18:23 Translation: I don’t care, there’s too much money to be made by my oil and gas buddies.

1877 2018-11-26 21:18:17 South Africa's Ministry of Energy plans to invest over US$1 billion in South Sudan's oil sector infrastructure, which will be the Largest Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in South Sudan.
1878 2018-11-26 21:18:11 Ahead of the coming #EIAReport, the US Strategic Petroleum Reserves (SPR) shed another 2 million barrels over the past week down to 650.6 million; down by 13M for 2018. This is taxpayer oil that is sold to commercial entities; hence added to commercial storage/use. #OOTT
1879 2018-11-26 21:18:09 When pti formed a Government, the Oil price was above US $70/barrel and in Pakistan, it was around Rs 90. Now it's below $50 and in Pakistan, it's around Rs 98. But the important part is, Kaptaan's first speech made me cry. His smile makes me happy and he only has 3 suits :(
1880 2018-11-26 21:18:03 Alhamdulillah
1881 2018-11-26 21:18:00 Coconut oil helped my face a lot!
1882 2018-11-26 21:17:48 100% responsible? Responsible for the low global oil prices that have hurt the oilpatch? Responsible for businesses leaving North America in droves because they can pay their workers less? Responsible for the Walmartization of our economy so that big box stores rule?
1883 2018-11-26 21:17:46 The four #RedSox World Series trophies that the team has captured this century will be on display this coming Saturday at McCoy Stadium as part of the @PawSox Enchanted Village Holiday Party. Runs from 11 a.m. until 2 p.m. Lenny DiNardo & Oil Can Boyd will also be present.
1884 2018-11-26 21:17:45 Will you listen to @NASA and combat climate change? Or is that oil money too sweet?
1885 2018-11-26 21:17:45 @qxeer__cryptid have you considered the chanukah display name: "Fry in Olly Oil" (or "Olivander Oil")
1886 2018-11-26 21:17:45 Heard u boycotted palm oil for a week until the friction wanks became too much
1887 2018-11-26 21:17:43 SA article: "ElectraMeccanica's new CFO could really help the company pivot, as she was CFO of a company that pivoted from Oil & Gas exploration, to lithium technology, to medical marijuana". So many pivots 
1888 2018-11-26 21:17:42 Indeed - what UK did to their own oil resources is shameful
1889 2018-11-26 21:17:40 Big oil will kill it soon
1890 2018-11-26 21:17:38 The app is succesfully uninstalled from hee phone
1891 2018-11-26 21:17:27 Harper was in power for $120 oil and put all our eggs in the American basket and we're suffering for it. CPC negligence caused this crisis.
1892 2018-11-26 21:17:19 What? War? Capitalism? The oil industry? The prison industrial complex? Gun manufacturers? These all kill. Abortion does not. You care more about what isn't a person than actual people.

Because it's not about saving children. It's about controlling women.
1893 2018-11-26 21:17:19 Chef Gusteau cut up some chocolate, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was a dictionary, along with Silly Putty.
1894 2018-11-26 21:17:13 Thank you very much! So happy to be part of the #SBSFamily
1895 2018-11-26 21:17:07 Rosemary Olive Oil bagel and potato soup!
1896 2018-11-26 21:17:07 Republicans are going to let the Planet go extinct just to please 100 oil people... while Americans do nothing, while the Media doesn't launch a 24 hrs campaign to explain the American people that Climate Change is real.
1897 2018-11-26 21:17:05 And a very true statement. Oil is waning. We need government to build for the future, , not to know how to US oil interests as @CPC_HQ is doing.
1898 2018-11-26 21:17:03 Big oil is trying to make people weary of climate change?
1899 2018-11-26 21:17:02 What about the plastic/oil/poop?  Is that included in the costs?
1900 2018-11-26 21:16:56 What are you celebrating? How are you celebrating? When are you to celebrate? If you want to burn books and stuff, rudi high school!
1901 2018-11-26 21:16:53 We are a dealership in New Brighton.

1905 2018-11-26 21:16:30 You're only recourse of action is to stab your ear drums until the pain desists. That, or maybe warm oil treatment, I dunno. Sorry about that, bro.
1906 2018-11-26 21:16:11 Rosemary olive oil bagel and hash browns?
1907 2018-11-26 21:16:10 Keep pushing forward Richard! As a proud WV D3 resident, I supported you against Dinghy Carol. You are spot on. Trump nailed it when he said he loved the uneducated. Snake oil con man fooled them all in 2016. Wake up America. He cares only about himself!
1908 2018-11-26 21:16:02 You ever wake up from a dream and try so hard to fall back asleep and go right back? I tried for close to an hour this morning to tuck back in after waking up from a dream where I was driving a monster truck around Lucas oil stadium .
1909 2018-11-26 21:16:01 She warn me abt that too.bsc i once block her on my insta data gane taci ubana
1910 2018-11-26 21:15:55 A hot bath really helps me if it’s too ugly to go outside. I add Epsom salts and some essential oil. Also, close your eyes, put both hands on your heart and feel your chest rise and fall with each breath. Thought arises, acknowledge it, breathe it out. Do it til your heart slows.
1911 2018-11-26 21:15:48 Because it's a fucking lie!! Look into how it's big oil propaganda..
1912 2018-11-26 21:15:48 Generally speaking offshore oil workers and container ship crews are not at risk of being shot at or killed/maimed by IEDs
1913 2018-11-26 21:15:47 Of course. An Oil guy was Secretary of State, and Anti-Environment guy was EPA Director, and now a Coal guy is running the EPA.
1914 2018-11-26 21:15:41 Spot on. Pep fears us. He genuinely does, he knows what the gaffer is building here. He can see the empirical evidence right before his eyes. He knows Klopp will only make us stronger. Without oil money. Time will tell who is the better coach.
1915 2018-11-26 21:15:40 And what about us out here in Alberta Ms. Simpson?  Oh ya Oil industry workers don’t resonate with CBC Toronto.  Proud Canadian.
1916 2018-11-26 21:15:37 Ricin comes from the castor oil bean. One of the deadliest poisons. Wonder if he wants to try this natural oil.
1917 2018-11-26 21:15:36 2019, some weird oil stats nerd: "so it appears driving is up amongst subruban conservatives"
1918 2018-11-26 21:15:31 The measure will be named "Jake's Law" after Jake Honig of Howell, a 7-year-old boy who died from brain cancer in January. Jake was helped by cannabis oil but his parents were forced to use it sparingly because of the state's strict limits on how much could be purchased.
1919 2018-11-26 21:15:28 Is Ambira High School made of the seven students? No! Did the others go through the 'ritual'? Possibly yes! But they knew the line! You don't call people names, claim you cheated on exams, tape yourselves and share it on media! That is stupid-stupid! Hello, Dr Njoya!
1920 2018-11-26 21:15:25 Lol same thing: oil prices have nothing to do with politics, find another scapegoat
1921 2018-11-26 21:15:25 Just me, or anyone else okay with the oil industry fledgling if it means the prices at my pumps keep going down? #boohoo
1922 2018-11-26 21:15:22 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.
1923 2018-11-26 21:15:19 How many is my body...small hypo is okay but @sammchizi and @zico4reel mehn both of you needs special anointing oil for cleansing
1924 2018-11-26 21:15:15 Thanks. Loving the oil pastels. I don't have many colors so was checking out bigger sets...I can get a set of 50 for like seven bucks. So gonna see if my son will get it for me....not holding out much hope though..Sorry got carried away. 
1925 2018-11-26 21:15:11 @lilmeerahcute grab mamas phone, change her twitter password, then log it out, case solved.
1926 2018-11-26 21:15:11 Would the big guy be okay with an alternate PAM applicator if using Extra Virgin Olive Oil PAM?
1927 2018-11-26 21:15:10 Congratulations everyone Welcome to the #SBSFamily 
1928 2018-11-26 21:15:07 I've got olive oil drops but not tried it warm, thank you. The cold is killing me!
1929 2018-11-26 21:14:59 Lots of coverage of prospective sad loss of 2500 jobs;  more than the loss of probably 100,000 direct and indirect job losses in oil patch in Alberta.  Tells me everything about CBC, Federal Government, Trudeau and Morneau and then Ontario and Quebec.  Alberta the suckers!
1930 2018-11-26 21:14:58 Keep trying @nudgecards 
1931 2018-11-26 21:14:58 If you like a lot of mustard oil on your chapati, join our club!
1932 2018-11-26 21:14:52 I’ve spent the past hour trying to work out what the overwhelming smell of coconut is in my house. Turns out I accidentally bought coconut oil infused tissues.  
1933 2018-11-26 21:14:48 It's hard to know the truth when "scientists" are paid by oil companies to cast doubt on climate change. Same tactics used for cigarettes. $$ 
Now, I follow Katharine Hayoe to get the reality of climate change. @KHayhoe kathar
1934 2018-11-26 21:14:42 I know. But you’ll never persuade the natcases that there isn’t a conspiracy to deprive Scotland of its oil revenues. As for getting them to see reality.... forget it.
1935 2018-11-26 21:14:41 #MAGA cult members -- the snake oil salesman lied to you again, and again and again...NOW the lies are hurting you..14,000 jobs lost because of his failed policies. u said he'd run the gov't like a business -- he's running it like his business (remember 6 bankruptcies)
1936 2018-11-26 21:14:36 This remains a tiny issue in Canada compared to the Alberta oil crisis.
1937 2018-11-26 21:14:33 It's true all the same isn't it? She stole milk from the mouths of babes and pissed oil revenues up the wall just to ensure votes from working classes. She is the reason the 80s were hateful
1938 2018-11-26 21:14:31 “Thou Shalt Not Kill ... unless of course you get oil at the right price. Phony Christian fuckers.  I hope they all rot in Hell.” ~ anonymous
1939 2018-11-26 21:14:31 Thank you!!
1940 2018-11-26 21:14:29 This impact never affected their pockets. Even wit the over flogged impact, their greed and heartlessness still propelled them to divert and loot same sickling oil sector. Can't u see their was no intention to make things better. The crash in oil happened to puncture their greed
1941 2018-11-26 21:14:28 Luckily Trump isn’t in control of the UK, he’s currently ‘making America great again’...
Why would we want to trade with America? We can just deal straight with the Arabs for oil and avoid a war!!
1942 2018-11-26 21:14:02 Yeh he   exactly knew like he does in his wedding he was using oil in hair for  south groom looks and succeed in that
1943 2018-11-26 21:14:01 Rubbed organic coconut oil over my cat's head, shoulders, and back because she keeps attracting ear mites despite all the regular precautions. We'll see if it helps but in the meantime she smells like one giant fuzzy coconut so that's a bonus.
1944 2018-11-26 21:13:48 My wrx is a 6 star oil eater sheeesh
1945 2018-11-26 21:13:47 soooo oil companies in America are now going bankrupt bc trump wants to get oil from Saudi even though it’s actually more expensive for the US lol thanks trump
1946 2018-11-26 21:13:37 Tea tree oil and olive oil does wonders!
1947 2018-11-26 21:13:32 Thank you Lizzie ....
1948 2018-11-26 21:13:30 Needed an oil change and it was going to take an hour and half so @MrTireAuto in Cary gave me a lift home!
1949 2018-11-26 21:13:20 Watching them change my oil bc I’m crazy and my new Jeep is my BABY
1950 2018-11-26 21:13:18 The pretty whack Airbnb I was staying at had no oil, and also no cutting board or knife

1952 2018-11-26 21:13:09 That would be the dream. Sadly oil money behind plastic production is going to make that difficult. We also have 7bn metric tons of plastic on the planet that needs another life so that it doesn't just got on landfill and pollute the seas. 
1953 2018-11-26 21:13:08 President Donald #Trump, meanwhile, didn't let up on the pressure he was piling on the kingdom to refrain from production cuts at the Dec. 6 #OPEC meeting, with the latest act being a self-congratulatory tweet on Sunday that read: "So great that oil prices are falling
1954 2018-11-26 21:13:03 Coconut oil is great for everything
1955 2018-11-26 21:13:02 I didn't live here in 2014, I'm English, so have had to play catch-up.

It appears that the media in 2014 portrayed the oil as running out, which has been proven to be untrue.

I wouldn't have thought that was a complex distinction for a fellow adult.
1956 2018-11-26 21:12:58 ‘Throw yourself on the parish’  with Nee’oil, Emmurr, The Blessed Shula & Jim in judgement - bonne chance! #thearchers
1957 2018-11-26 21:12:58 adulterated oil
1958 2018-11-26 21:12:49 Overall, he has none.
This push for renewables directly cancels out a push for higher wages. 
The same as a push for affordable housing is cancelled by extremely liberal immigration policy. 
Synchronicity between diff gov policies,hard to detect in many cases
1959 2018-11-26 21:12:47 *At “Italian” food option in student center, getting pasta*

Me: “Do you have olive oil?”

“No”

“Butter?”

 “No”

“Is there anywhere to get either of the two in the facility”

“No”

Ultimately I went to Dunkin to get some butter. My school needs to GET IT TOGETHER
1960 2018-11-26 21:12:43 getting an oil change
1961 2018-11-26 21:12:41 Raise ur hand if you took a nap while in line for an oil change today 
1962 2018-11-26 21:12:35 Many Dems get donations from the Nat Gas industry, which they think looks 'greener'.  It's not. And they are owned by the same people as Big Oil.
1963 2018-11-26 21:12:34 Saudi Arabia’s oil production hit an all-time high of 11.1 million to 11.3 million barrels per day (bpd) in November, Reuters quoted an industry source as saying. The exact output averaged for the month will only be known when November is over, it said
1964 2018-11-26 21:12:18 Let me find out you weed smoking niggas getting CBD oil pumped in ya ass.
1965 2018-11-26 21:12:10 Your career don finish for twitter  just block her ki chigaba da bugama cigarinki wuta 
1966 2018-11-26 21:12:07 People will find any fucking way to bring politics into everything. 

“Pineapple never went on pizza when bush was president”

“Well, I never had to get an oil change when Obama was president wtf” 

“Bc Trump is president, my cousins nephew’s hamster died bc of lettuce”
1967 2018-11-26 21:12:07 Nne oil dey your head...
1968 2018-11-26 21:12:05 Thanks! I do frequently just roast up some sweet potatoes in olive oil and eat them alone or with quinoa!
1969 2018-11-26 21:12:00 Ironically those computer startups are dependent on wood and oil etc etc in Canada because a GDP heavily based on resources means investment dollars exist. Also computer startups fall very short of resource industry in creating massive employment.
1970 2018-11-26 21:11:49 #Crudeoil was up more than 2% on Monday after Friday’s 8% rout after Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said current prices were an “extremely attractive entry point for longs in oil” and other commodities.
1971 2018-11-26 21:11:38 vitamin e oil >
1972 2018-11-26 21:11:37 No you have. The Saudis helped fly planes into the Towers.. Now you help them because of oil and $$$..
1973 2018-11-26 21:11:31 It’s been about a year and one month since I cut ten inches of my hair off and it’s back down to where it was before I cut it  I use this oil called the new evolution hair serum. It’s in a glass bottle and I only use that on my ends and to run my hands thru my hair!!
1974 2018-11-26 21:11:23 Thanks Lizzie! x
1975 2018-11-26 21:11:22 I have felt glancing blows from the oil crowd. 
I get that you want a pipeline. I get that you want to blame someone (Trudeau & Notley). But be assured the outcome under Kenney will be no different in that regard except for more bluster! 
Negotiations are important
1976 2018-11-26 21:11:21 Learnt the Award Winning actor/governor has given 10million Naira to one of the nation's investigating agencies. 

The guy don rub the oil for their lips and they cannot prosecute him.
1977 2018-11-26 21:11:14 In bed with two jumpers on no money for food and we have no oil left in the tank woooo
1978 2018-11-26 21:11:09 That's right! Because when you leave and go back into the EU, they'll have your fish, your gas & oil, bound by all their regulations, banking, common aggracultural policy, fishing policy, your quote of immigrants, hard borderetc. None of this "that's have another ref 2 malarkey"
1979 2018-11-26 21:11:09 No the people who are lobbying for the oil and gas companies are driven by money!
1980 2018-11-26 21:11:03 Thank you! I shall certainly try! lol x
1981 2018-11-26 21:11:02 Never felt so betrayed! Lil did i know i was feigning to eat shaving cream and motor oil smh
1982 2018-11-26 21:10:58 The recession is in the making ... or why do you think he is interested in low rates and the oil price (well the low oil price has other reasons)
1983 2018-11-26 21:10:28 this is going to sound really stupid and obvious but i started using coconut oil on my hair and stuff and my hair has been soooo healthy and as u guys know i dye my hair a LOT and it’s super thin and damaged so if you’ve ever been like skeptical about it i recommend it uwu
1984 2018-11-26 21:10:27 Yes that's just their aim , they knw most Nigerians dont read beyond headlines
1985 2018-11-26 21:10:26 So, I decided to move from Coconut oil to an actual body lotion, after about 4 years. 

It hasn’t been up to 3 weeks of using said lotion and I’m already seeing some green lines on my thighs. 
1986 2018-11-26 21:10:25 I'm not even going to post that video of you-know-who denying you-know-what because I don't believe even *he* believes what he's saying. It's all about making money - for himself by helping his buddies in oil and coal. I believe scientists.
1987 2018-11-26 21:10:22 look into CBD oil !!!! in high milligram doses
1988 2018-11-26 21:10:19 あの時のBBの言葉はスッゲー嬉しかったなー…
1989 2018-11-26 21:10:15 I grew up in Alberta and I'm keenly aware of the value of our energy sector, but it's kinda funny how no one was complaining about "handcuffs" when oil was + $90/brl.
1990 2018-11-26 21:10:08 Warm olive oil. Put your head sideways on the kitchen counter on a tea towel, get Alan to pour a teaspoon of warm olive oil in gently, leave it a few moments up to a minute and then let it come out onto the towel. Repeat
1991 2018-11-26 21:10:08 @rmaggie040  WAKY, WAKY IS TIME FOR YOUR MEDS. THE REASON YOUR DREAM PIPE LINES WAS DENIED AND WHY? THE OIL PRICES ARE GOING DOWN? IS ALL THE OPPOSITE OF YOUR DREAMS! WAKY, WAKY IS BECOMING A NIGHTMARE!
1992 2018-11-26 21:10:04 サラダ油に流されて変わってゆく私をあなたは時々遠くで叱って。
1993 2018-11-26 21:10:01 What UK sells besides oil, pharma, cars, whisky. UK buys microsoft, crappy cars, cinema, nike, Jim Beam. I'm sure there's lots more
1994 2018-11-26 21:09:49 Brian is confused. It's not that government has no place in business. It's that business has no place in government. From Amazon and Disney hungry for handouts to Big Oil/Big Pharma dictating gov policy, the people are left with pizza crusts #resist #FBR #reparentingrevolution
1995 2018-11-26 21:09:43  I swear I was thinking "that's motor oil" when I watched the Burger King pancake commercial
1996 2018-11-26 21:09:42 Dude at McDonald’s I literally put a basket on my arm right after it came out the oil
1997 2018-11-26 21:09:34 Either way, it's still amazing. 
1998 2018-11-26 21:09:20 The shoreline act you referred to refers to shoreline railways, oddly enough, not transportation of oil under federal jurisdiction of Transport Canada.
Perhaps you could post unrelated act about fisheries too?
1999 2018-11-26 21:09:19 My day so far:

Flight to Houston was delayed 45 minutes because the plane had low oil pressure.

Ran like Kevin McAllister for 750 yards w/ a carryon and a backpack through Houston Int’l. 

Missed flight by 2 minutes. 

Current status: lungs are paralyzed

2000 2018-11-26 21:09:18 I'll take the green bean tacos with Lancer sauce please (motor oil from a Lancer)
2001 2018-11-26 21:09:17 Ввааааа я аж покраснела!\(//∇//)\
2002 2018-11-26 21:09:16 dreamt that i was painting w oil paints & my art looked cool af but then i woke up & realized I don't own oil paints & my art sucks :/
2003 2018-11-26 21:09:16 Couldn’t have picked a shittier day to get my oil changed 
2004 2018-11-26 21:09:08 I found out that vitamin e oil helps lubricate your skin and it’ll help with the itching! 
2005 2018-11-26 21:09:05 It’s that it either the she’s butter oil I’ve been putting it in
2006 2018-11-26 21:09:02 @Valvoline Had my oil changed a few months ago at your location on transit road in clarence since  I didn't have the time to get around to it what a mistake I went to change it and the plug is now stripped which it wasn't before and it's on so tight had to put air tool it thanks
2007 2018-11-26 21:09:02 There are no secret oil fields. There are well-known and much-reported oil fields. I wouldn't have thought that was a complex distinction for a fellow adult.
2008 2018-11-26 21:08:58 With all the oil that the U.S. is producing, a gallon of gas should cost $0.50 cents..
2009 2018-11-26 21:08:57 Just for clarity, what exactly are you saying?
Bitter Together never ran a campaign which leaned heavily on the 'oil running out' trope?
Or are you saying the voters are stupid for believing the 'respected' media sources & official No campaign who told them it was running out?
2010 2018-11-26 21:08:55 This girl!
Ur head has oil

2011 2018-11-26 21:08:54 @sccstreetsahead  there is a spillage of either diesel or oil all over the pavement (and onto road) on Main Street Hackenthorpe, outside the car park of the old Sportsman Inn. – bij Sportsman Inn
2012 2018-11-26 21:08:54 What about the money behind blocking Canadian oil? Considering your past employment, you should be able to describe, in detail, who is paying to impede our economy.
2013 2018-11-26 21:08:46 @AlisonRosen hey suggestion. Use olive oil to make grill cheese sandwich.  Maybe garlic flavored.  It’s really good.
2014 2018-11-26 21:08:43 Soooo... You traded lower oil prices in exchange for covering up a murder of an American resident.  How very UNAMERICAN of you!
2015 2018-11-26 21:08:37 Olive oil then castor oil
2016 2018-11-26 21:08:36 I read on this ages ago! It's called glamour photography, even with burgers they pour oil on it 
2017 2018-11-26 21:08:26 Eat well. Cactus oil is good for dry hair. Avoid multiple hair treatments. Is it NISIM or NHB? makes hair healthier. or similar? How to locate the actual web page. Worth the effort. So flexible.
2018 2018-11-26 21:08:22 True but we're spending billions on foreign oil when we could supply our own and prop our own crude prices at the same time !!!
2019 2018-11-26 21:08:21 Beto el Fako cares not about the poor inner city. It's all about the brand. He's the next face on the can of Demo snake oil.
2020 2018-11-26 21:08:11 He's a hard dude to figure. His talent and creativity is apparent but what's his motivation. He is set for life moneywise thx to an oil partnership (yep) so what motivated him at this point? That's the real question that will determine what he does.
2021 2018-11-26 21:08:11 This everything bagel is seriously lacking in truffle oil, sprinkles, the blood of my enemies and the stolen dreams of children.
2022 2018-11-26 21:08:06 83k???

1 bag of rice ...
Kilos of chicken....
20 liters groundnut oil...
Ingredients...

What remains for Wedding to set ...but no ...it's date you want to do ....
2023 2018-11-26 21:08:03 Not even necessary as US now exports oil.  Just keep the oil here. No problem.
2024 2018-11-26 21:08:02 Especially since #EnergyEast would allow us to stop importing Saudi oil - which would be one way to "get back" at the Saudis for their human rights record.  Dear @JustinTrudeau will probably rather cancel the arms contract throwing away 000's of jobs.
2025 2018-11-26 21:07:58 B. is the only real choice. Add Pence and you have my vote!

Trump has no wealth—only stolen American money. I couldn't live with that.

What does make Earth beautiful mean? To many, oil rigs and death signifies beauty. A drowning world is beautiful to the @GOP because tax cuts.
2026 2018-11-26 21:07:53 €25 and some peanut butter will do the trick 
 (organic, and palm oil free) 
2027 2018-11-26 21:07:48 Well if they find oil then that means there was carbon life at one point on Mars...
2028 2018-11-26 21:07:44 Imagine your data as oil beneath your behavioral landscape.

Social media companies have become an OPEC-style cartel that colludes to transform your land into a psychological prison and sell your data without giving you a seat at the negotiation table.

They drink your milkshake.

2032 2018-11-26 21:07:13 Your headline states "secret oil fields"... which have just come online. Your headline takes a disparaging tone, even if you were reporting what you genuinely thought to be true in 2015.

Wouldn't it be honourable to just apologise for casting aspersions?
2033 2018-11-26 21:07:10 Oil dey your head, i love you for this. Please follow me back
2034 2018-11-26 21:07:04 Follow the money Big oil is not a myth
2035 2018-11-26 21:07:02 No he'll be visiting england, as you'll be water poor, energy poor and oil poor. ( When Scotland leaves aswell)
2036 2018-11-26 21:06:57 all those frenchies on strike because of oil price while others are actually eating it...
2037 2018-11-26 21:06:54 Bitcoin is still pushing out coins to miners And processing txns. Looks like a cyber Monday sale today. 

The staggering of your dip strategy is now a proven method to keep your sanity.

Oil is down also. Bear  mkts are where legends are born.

2039 2018-11-26 21:06:47 Hey! The only fudge that contains Palm Oil is our Biscoff Fudge. The palm oil in this fudge is actually from a sustainable source!

2040 2018-11-26 21:06:46 DELUSIONAL! Absolute hogwash! I find it very hard to believe he doesn't drink. With his miserable record on the environment (bringing back the coal mines, drilling for oil in protected & pristine regions, etc.): "Release the carbon emissions!" He is such a LIAR!
2041 2018-11-26 21:06:38 The other potential is hyper-inflation - in a scenario where a combination of nationalism increases the cost of basic goods and the currency devalues due to financial stress (perceived or real) - eg. bank liquidity (requiring gov bailouts) + reduction in oil prices.
2042 2018-11-26 21:06:35 If I break your heart, na oil spillage
2043 2018-11-26 21:06:26 lets go back to using oil,bet it would only take once.
2044 2018-11-26 21:06:22 What beautiful sounds I hear at night, cars driving past, birds and the youth of today saying “oh oh oh grind the weed up bruv oil grind it up bruv gotta sell it” ahh sweet sounds
2045 2018-11-26 21:06:14 Oga I read it, it's still indirectly saying the same thing.
2046 2018-11-26 21:06:11 Congratulations everyone.
2047 2018-11-26 21:06:10 What would the federal treasury stand to gain if CDN oil sold at world prices? Huge $$$! Saving that little tidbit for elxn campaign, I'll bet!

2049 2018-11-26 21:06:09 Far be for me to hypocriticize, but adaptation should take a back seat to destroying oil companies in accord with the IPCC recommendations. If we can prevail against the oil companies, then we can think about how, or whether, to rebuild.
2050 2018-11-26 21:06:06 oil is used for plastics
2051 2018-11-26 21:06:01 CBD oil really pumping my life up
2052 2018-11-26 21:06:01 The US will soon be a net exporter of oil. Storage is at capacity and utilisation is down. Is Trump going to take credit for all the unemployed oil patch workers if oil drops any further?

2055 2018-11-26 21:05:41 The moron knows it is true but denies it so he can keep getting paid BIG MONEY by BIG OIL to deny climate change.  How many must die to protect the 1 percent of America.
2056 2018-11-26 21:05:41 Both. The farce is tragic. Depending on how he wants to manipulate the situation, Cheeto Mussolini will either claim ignorance/denial of climate change for oil profiteering, or claim it's true in order to, say, protect his golf course in Ireland. The chump has negative integrity.
2057 2018-11-26 21:05:39 Baby oil
2058 2018-11-26 21:05:34 @ChiChiCardsUK Thank you so much! Enjoy your time in the spotlight 
2059 2018-11-26 21:05:34 In a sit out with a friend who is married and his phone rings and i see "Ama engine oil" on his phone screen. I just found out it his side chick Amaka.... smh
2060 2018-11-26 21:05:28 Thanks @SmoothiePR .... there we were beavering away in The Oil Hut making and dispatching orders when  Twitter explodes and we discover we are part of the #SBS family. 

What an evening - thanks @TheoPaphitis
2061 2018-11-26 21:05:26 I would love to put oil all over your body!
2062 2018-11-26 21:05:19 Cactus oil is good for dry hair. Do not brush hair when wet. Stay away from products with parabens. Is it NISIM or NHB? Best shampoo for hair loss. or closely related. How must I uncover the legitimate web page. Many benefits. Was so good.
2063 2018-11-26 21:05:10 Yep. Big bucks in climate science. Maybe real big 4 and 5 figure grants. Get real. It's only about the money to big oil and big coal and their pet politicians.
2064 2018-11-26 21:05:02 Soaked my hair in olive oil. I smell like a Italian hooker
2065 2018-11-26 21:05:01 Regular people don’t buy OIL, they buy GASOLINE. 

Which costs MORE today than it did on Trump’s inauguration.

This “fact check” is playing right into the propaganda’s hands by checking irrelevant facts.
2066 2018-11-26 21:04:56 @CTV_PowerPlay   Liberal government bought a pipeline "for Alberta" that was already moving our oil products and efficiently maintained and owned by Trans Canada.  The Government  now collects rent from the oil companies to transport our oil products. Where is our benefit?
2067 2018-11-26 21:04:53 @AliVelshi @ivingffhs Ali did u just state that $50.00 a barrel oil is not good as Fracking for oil would be no longer cost-effective. I thought you were an environmentalist/ Fracking should be banned.
2068 2018-11-26 21:04:52 Did you come out to Alberta to see what you could do for oil patch workers? I forget.
2069 2018-11-26 21:04:47 it is objectively worse, but the denial of climate change is so connected with global oligarchy/oil that they, at this point, can't even really be distinguished from each other anymore. they amass to the same end, they stem from the same source.
2070 2018-11-26 21:04:44 Exactly this! This is years of evangelical indoctrination coming home to roost.

The ironic part.... The conservatives supported the oil boom which brought the demographic change that they are so desperately afraid of. 

They want to eat all of their cake!
2071 2018-11-26 21:04:39 Oil emissions are higher, maybe you were looking at the wrong line? The global shares are different in energy and CO2 units, since carbon content varies by fuel.
2072 2018-11-26 21:04:36 Fish oil vitamins!! Good for hair, skin and nails
2073 2018-11-26 21:04:33 Only when the oil had run out
2074 2018-11-26 21:04:31 thats what happens when you have to inhale the oil off 22 paintings...
2075 2018-11-26 21:04:28 * motor oil doesn’t absorb like real syrup 
2076 2018-11-26 21:04:28 No one in the oil and gas sector that I can recall has ever asked for direct financial subsidies. What they want and need is a fair, efficient, timely and transparent regulatory regime to allow them to conduct business. There is no policy comparison to be made here.
2077 2018-11-26 21:04:23 I hope they find oil on Mars then we’ll speed up the whole process and get our asses up there so we can ruin that place as well.
2078 2018-11-26 21:04:13 21He stretched out his hand at his friends

and broke his covenant.

22Softer than butter is his speech,

but war is in his heart.

Smoother than oil are his words,

but they are unsheathed swords.
2079 2018-11-26 21:04:12 Try evening primrose oil it helps me greatly
2080 2018-11-26 21:04:06 Great article.  I too used to doubt global warming, even the ozone hole.  I remember writing school papers on it, using, of all things, Rush Limbaugh as a source.  Then I actually saw the science.  I choose, in an uncertain world, to believe scientists over the oil industry
2081 2018-11-26 21:04:05 Hard to pin down ,but I would age climate science at 50 yrs or less. The immense complexity of the system, when nobody has created a self sustaining biosphere yet, being " well " understood is suspect. The truth is crap data comprises much of the " research"
2082 2018-11-26 21:04:01 Thank you! So glad to be here!! #sbs
2083 2018-11-26 21:03:58 I'll tell you what I don't believe: he read any of it. As long as the oil companies keep throwing money at politicians, they are going to continue to deny the evidence, and delay dealing with the problems.
2084 2018-11-26 21:03:56 @BretBaier would love to hear about Ukraine, how falling gas prices are impacting American oil workers
2085 2018-11-26 21:03:47 can i moisturize my facial hair with my face lotion or do i have to get beard oil? i always thought beard oil was a scam banking in on fragile masculinity.
2086 2018-11-26 21:03:46 Dune is in part a pretty obvious sci fi ripoff of Lawrence of Arabia. Paul Atreides = Lawrence, Fremen = Arabs, sand worm = horse, spice = oil, etc. Both Dune and LoA use the popular trope of “white man goes native, becomes a better native than the natives.”
2087 2018-11-26 21:03:45 rn i’m using klavuu oil and water cleanser, klairs toner, cosrx snail essence, missha snail cream moisturizer and klavuu sunscreen! i really recommend anything cosrx since it’s cheap and quality, same with klairs. i really just shop around their bestsellers
2088 2018-11-26 21:03:45 Thanks lovely! I wish you the very best of luck! Fingers crossed!! #sbs
2089 2018-11-26 21:03:44 Have a larger budget inside the UK at our current tax rates (which are already higher than rUK) than we would outside it. Not to mention the costs of setting up our own infrastructure which was not accounted for in the white paper or the laughable over estimation of oil revenues
2090 2018-11-26 21:03:42 It certainly used to, I hope it still does - enjoy the madness
2091 2018-11-26 21:03:36 Since oil is organic that would be quite a big deal.
2092 2018-11-26 21:03:34 Noted my friend, I shall stick to oil by the sounds of it
2093 2018-11-26 21:03:31 Mid day workout complete. Feels good. Now time to finish the day strong!! Thank goodness for my @NaturesUltra CBD oil because it truly helps me recover quicker so i can hard again tomorrow. #MondayMotivaton #MondayMood #TakeNote #TeamIsEverything
2094 2018-11-26 21:03:27 Corn tortillas are a culinary marvel, but when a neighbor fries them in corn oil, every night for a year, they make your apartment building smell like someone pissed in the hallway.
2095 2018-11-26 21:03:15 I've got some oil of clove, its vile  has laurens cleared up now? Xxx
2096 2018-11-26 21:03:05 Go get some hair oil
2097 2018-11-26 21:03:00 can somebody link me to the video of the soup and pancake with the motor oil
2098 2018-11-26 21:02:57 My mom has actually been making a salve and oil from super high concentrated CBD so that's what I've been using. DM me if you want me to send you some
2099 2018-11-26 21:02:56 Alberta is perfectly suited for (with it’s short growing season and harsh winters) grains and oilseeds. Hardly the bread basket of the world. 
There is no magic switch. Just because you are against oil ( even though you use it everyday) doesn’t mean we should give it away.

2101 2018-11-26 21:02:47 End every war America is waging on behalf of a defense contractor or oil company, and you'll stop manufacturing refugees. It's that simple.
2102 2018-11-26 21:02:41 try baby oil or a body butter for sensitive skin? maybe combo with butter first then the oil
2103 2018-11-26 21:02:40 TM says leaving our biggest market the EU gives us back Money, Laws and Borders.
So @theresa_may if you agree with that statement then it follows that #Scotland  leaving the UK to regain the above + our Oil, Gas, Renewables, Water, Electric. And goods leaving by # #Scottish ports

2105 2018-11-26 21:02:22 Welp, let's see if CBD oil does anything
2106 2018-11-26 21:02:17 Hmmm - you don’t think, oh, I don’t know, say - oil & gas companies and their politicians might have a teeny bit more to gain than scientists?
2107 2018-11-26 21:02:16 Ebron is a top-five tight end rest of season. With oil being put on IR. Not even a hot take
2108 2018-11-26 21:02:13 Your assuming he hasn't done that already in oil and steel...... see Eric and Don jr for details
2109 2018-11-26 21:02:07 Ok. Have you compared the Harper deficits with Trudeau's? Imagine if Trudeau dropped a 55 Billion deficit! 35 Billion? That's was with good oil prices! Alberta requires investment because right now it's a one industry province, finite resource.
2110 2018-11-26 21:01:55 Meanwhile, Trump celebrates the lowering oil prices.
2111 2018-11-26 21:01:49 I AM SOOO EXITED INSIGHT HAS LANDED,I WONDER IF THAT RIVER DELTA ON MARS HAS BILLIONS OF BARRELS OF OIL?
2112 2018-11-26 21:01:42 it. was. a. joke. and no i would never spend money on an FA they are snake oil salesmen.
2113 2018-11-26 21:01:41 It appears they’re looking for minerals to exploit.  Lord help Mars if they discover oil.
2114 2018-11-26 21:01:28 They're very predictable
2115 2018-11-26 21:01:27 Imagine being tricked to fight for a war for oil, losing your sanity-your psychological security, -in the brutality of on the line combat, then coming home to a hyper politicized, PC, diversity obsessed, and hyper subversive culture, media, and social infrastructure/community
2116 2018-11-26 21:01:22 Some of the invaders come from countries to which we are indebted, need for oil, or military reasons.

2119 2018-11-26 21:01:15 Oil is the worst thing that ever happened to Nigeria.
2120 2018-11-26 21:01:15 Buy bag of rice,beans, garri, groundnut oil and tin tomatoes with spices against 2019
2121 2018-11-26 21:00:48 I can understand that. I suppose we hope to change that by giving aid. The deal also allowed Iran to trade with the rest of the world, the hope being that reliance on trade will move the regime away from terrorism (they don’t want to bomb potential customers for their oil).
2122 2018-11-26 21:00:39 Am only now realising that "Esso" = "Ess - oh" = "S.O." = "Standard Oil."

(To be clear, I knew the corporate family tree, just not this particular brand derivation.)

2129 2018-11-26 21:00:02 1-The one who gets the land deal ( by his means n source) get the dealership from oil companies,as per procedure the oil company signs the land lease with the land owner and appoints dealer as per prior understanding .
So @fiaztanoli39 is correct
2130 2018-11-26 20:59:49 Girl, you need to go to the doctors and figure out what's up with these headaches. Also, try cbd oil! I've heard it helps a lot!

2134 2018-11-26 20:59:40 Looks like oil splatter on the surface.
2135 2018-11-26 20:59:39 How about helping the 100,000 people in Alberta's oil patch get back on their feet? @JustinTrudeau @gmbutts @SohiAmarjeet Oh yeah, I forgot you couldn't give a shit about the west. #PMsockboy
2136 2018-11-26 20:59:25 Using the correct lube is safe , incorrect lube like baby oil for example messes up ya ph balance

2142 2018-11-26 20:59:03 This is an adorable delightful comic strip on #InSight, which I am absolutely sure is really there to look for oil and metals and other plunderable Mars stuff.

2145 2018-11-26 20:58:28 Damon scowls he had freeze and oil all over him as he shows a picture of Natsume dressed as a girl-

You sure
2146 2018-11-26 20:58:27 I think oil capitulates for a third time before any sort of real rally. Need to see energy stocks show strength on a day oil sells off before going long
2147 2018-11-26 20:58:26 Women still under represented in front line combat roles, coal miners and oil riggers. Crickets chirping in the background.

2150 2018-11-26 20:58:17 Last stop and then imma go do my oil change
2151 2018-11-26 20:58:17 Pls tell me  exactly how any government has in the past influenced the price of oil? If the price of oil that we produce is priced so low how is it that the gas pumps are priced on the basis of west Texas price? Does this suggest we are not buying our own production?
2152 2018-11-26 20:58:12 Genuine question: What is the + in Norway+? It's obviously not implicit in EEA membership and if Norway haven't bought it despite pots of oil money then maybe it's not worth having?
2153 2018-11-26 20:58:10 In GOD we trust “ Guns Oil Drugs “
2154 2018-11-26 20:57:50 Of all the acts of logical acrobatics I witness daily on this website, switching seamlessly from railing against oil companies to demanding subsidies for auto manufacturers is pretty high up there in sheer WTF value.
2155 2018-11-26 20:57:49 Thank you Julie, thrilled to be part of #SBS
2156 2018-11-26 20:57:35 he is all talk, wtf, go after the supply management, get rid of that , Trudue refused which was the reason for tariffs by US, 
because the jerk wants to destroy what is left in Canada, along with Alberta oil, get them all on the dole, were he can control them all, depend on  gov
2157 2018-11-26 20:57:32 Trump isn’t ignorant or stupid. He just prefers oil industry profits over America’s future generations.
2158 2018-11-26 20:57:30 My big oil check(s) came. They're just smaller. Since Trump's taking credit for low gas prices, I'll blame him.
2159 2018-11-26 20:57:24 To those who think GEJ's govt 'grew' the economy. Sorry to bust your bubble, the Nigerian economy tends to do well when oil price is high and there's peace in the Niger Delta. It can literally grow on autopilot.
PMB's admin came in at the wrong time. Came in clueless too.

2161 2018-11-26 20:57:17 It’s funny how if the government finds diamonds or oil in your backyard it’s government property... but if they find drugs, it’s yours
2162 2018-11-26 20:57:08 But the "carbon tax" that was removed from gas was a very well defined and small amount.  So you can pretend like that's unknowable and buy into the lies from our government, or you can accept that the vast majority of this decrease is as a result of decreasing global oil prices.
2163 2018-11-26 20:57:08 So you ate like 3bags of rice 20kg groundnut oil  is alright

2166 2018-11-26 20:56:57 Yummy, can I rub oil and other slicky on you?
2167 2018-11-26 20:56:50 Got my oil changed, now I just need to invest in getting my brakes changed and a new set of tires and I’m good for the winter 
2168 2018-11-26 20:56:50 Their matter tired me, and how two people will pass side by side looking for themselves and would never meet, or the usual scene where a character has a twin he doesn't know since onset, they keep repeating sequence
2169 2018-11-26 20:56:48 Is discounted and discarded. Assuming the truth to be obvious, apparent and immutable.  
As far as the process goes, this is THE single most destructive mindset you could have to scientific process itself. Assuming you know what you dont know
2170 2018-11-26 20:56:42 so somebody will spend 40k to watch u do stuffs, is like Dem soak dis girl brain inside condemned oil
2171 2018-11-26 20:56:38 What allies? They can’t protect their borders with a greater immigration threat than ours. Wake UP.  Last time we had allies was only when their oil markets were threatened.
2172 2018-11-26 20:56:31 Nope. Currently looking up VW dealers near me. My self-diagnostic skills start and end at oil changes and switching fuses.

That's enough for me.
2174 2018-11-26 20:56:18 It was one of if not the single biggest reason to steal the election.

We know why.  It’s always been about the oil.

It’s Black Gold to a handful of rich and powerful men who are subjecting all living creatures to Black Death.
2175 2018-11-26 20:56:16 No, Lindsey, you don’t. Regardless of your “feelings” about Trump, objectively, it isn’t hard to discern the damage Trump is doing to the American ideal.  So disappointed you have fallen for this snake oil salesman.
2176 2018-11-26 20:56:12 I could’ve kept all the manufacturing jobs and oil jobs here and actually increased them 10 fold, along with massive tax revenues, so that you could have had all Canadians employed plus as much illegal immigration as your little heart desires. But you didn’t vote for me. Haha.
2177 2018-11-26 20:56:00 i am a fervent supporter of the trans-Alaskan pipeline [finding out that it's oil and not trans people] stupid bullshit idea i always hated it

2181 2018-11-26 20:55:42 this lady putting oil and lotion on my legs cause she know i’m black and it’s cold outside. a queen.
2182 2018-11-26 20:55:31 A couple of drops of oil of cloves on one of those soft chillable teething rings will help. And yes he is cute
2183 2018-11-26 20:55:31 Trudeau and the liberals don’t want to build the pipeline when they want phase out the oil sands
2184 2018-11-26 20:55:27 She fried the oil in the tomatoes.
2185 2018-11-26 20:55:24 I know some like to punch above their weight so people will think you're balling but we knw Nigeria has more middle classed people than Togo & Benin republic have people. 83k is much for many of us, let's be honest. In one sitting, when it's not crude oil you're using to eat rice
2186 2018-11-26 20:55:23 OH GOD The Vabrinum coconut oil 
2187 2018-11-26 20:55:18 Have you ever tried CBD oil?
A. Yes I have
B. No I haven't
C. What the heck is that?
2188 2018-11-26 20:55:16 mmm slurppp lov that motor oil
2189 2018-11-26 20:55:09 Oh he lies about most things. He is a snake oil salesman but most people knew he was one. Others felt the lies rang true to what they wanted to hear. CoalJobs for one. What a joke.
2190 2018-11-26 20:55:06 What the hell? Stop palm oil consumption and let the villagers run dry. I know they don't get paid much, but the abusers deserve it.
2191 2018-11-26 20:55:03 I did NOT spend 10 of my hard earned ethnic dollars just to have this dirty ass rain wash out my argan oil leave in conditioner!!! 
2192 2018-11-26 20:54:55 Obama- greatest snake oil salesman the world has ever seen and American voters fell for it twice. Really unbelievable.
2193 2018-11-26 20:54:43 Steven Goddard, aka Tony Heller,  is not a publishing climate scientist. He's a fraud. He sells snake oil.
2194 2018-11-26 20:54:43 I will help fund the moving of snow. A little oil based lube and some water.
2195 2018-11-26 20:54:42 The world fucked up if they find diamonds and oil in your back yard it’s government property but if they find weed it’s yours 
2196 2018-11-26 20:54:38 idk how this shit is legal. i think i’m sweating oil
2197 2018-11-26 20:54:35 According to BP's Statistical Review of Global Energy 2017 Consumption in Mtoe was Oil 4622, Coal 3731 and Gas 3156. Surely then 2017 CO2 emissions for oil must be higher? Maybe different sources of data?
2198 2018-11-26 20:54:34 1) A conversation between myself and a Brexiteer who blames migration for all his problems. Thing is, he's a nice bloke, which makes it all the sadder that he's fallen for the snake oil. Bare with me.....
2199 2018-11-26 20:54:24 Regarding championing Canadian oil, I agree that this is important - people are very concerned about climate change in particular, and Albertan and Canadian climate policy should help to make the case, e.g. with Keystone XL.
2200 2018-11-26 20:54:22 Goan buy Olive oil
2201 2018-11-26 20:54:15 All I'm seeing on the tl is this shit about motor oil on pancakes
2202 2018-11-26 20:54:08 Converting northern’s to coconut butter over olive oil is by far and away my biggest achievement of second year
2203 2018-11-26 20:53:57 Did the Liberals not just buy a pipeline? Has the GoC not invested millions in R&D to support the oil sands over the years?
2204 2018-11-26 20:53:54 Yeah I just need an oil change. Hold the sexual harassment k thanks.
2205 2018-11-26 20:53:54 Peak oil leads to peak water from peak population

2206 2018-11-26 20:53:45 Yeah. I realized I have to use heavier oil in it since natural now.
2207 2018-11-26 20:53:38 Historically, disproving a theory that explains a law has been as valuable to the scientific process as validating a theory and in most cases MORE effort expended by scientific community to do so. 
In this case any data or research suggesting otherwise
2208 2018-11-26 20:53:28 ROFLMAO.
2209 2018-11-26 20:53:19 He has oil barons to keep happy, screw the people. #TrumpIsNotAboveTheLaw
2210 2018-11-26 20:53:14 สวยงาม
2211 2018-11-26 20:53:02 There is an argument out there that Nixon would have weathered Watergate absent the '73 recession plus oil shocks.
2212 2018-11-26 20:52:59 @AStartShow I found a glitch in Mania Plus! By getting Knuckles to climb up the wall to the left of the lever at the beginning of Oil Ocean Act 2 (Encore), he can either jump back up to the end of Act 1 & softlock the game or get pushed out of the wall by an invisible oil slide.
2213 2018-11-26 20:52:52 “She’s strong on the border, the military, and supports conservative judges...”(Now you’re using Trump’s rote candidate support language?)
She’s also strong on segregated schools and likes joking about voter suppression & the good oil’ days of the Old South!
She’s TERRIBLE for MS
2214 2018-11-26 20:52:44 I'd fell a lot more reasured if #Angus put #UKOG in charge as operator . No sidetracking the wrong well. Getting permits and planning in place. Building trusting relationships with regulatory bodies. And most of all pumping shed loads of oil and gas .

Viva. :)

2216 2018-11-26 20:52:41 So.. which essential oil cures depression?
2217 2018-11-26 20:52:32 I feel very bad for the people at the quickie oil change place, who spend half their time trying to sell me stuff I don’t need because they work on commission.
2218 2018-11-26 20:52:30 what happened to those us army oil memes
2219 2018-11-26 20:52:23 You don't understand, I'll explain! As apposed to changing from finite resources, like oil/coal, which are hazardous/deadly! America has chosen to sent their funds abroad, promoting chaos, instead! Not great at all, promoting global unbalance to sustain finite anything is weak!
2220 2018-11-26 20:52:22 Sounds like someone needs a dose of CBD oil
2221 2018-11-26 20:52:20 CNN just had Tom Delay on to refute the latest Gov report on Climate.  Santorum is paid by the Oil/Gas industry, if CNN cared about transparency they would disclose this before Santorum uttered a word.

2223 2018-11-26 20:52:06 Vegetarian life hack: if you ever screw up a tofu dish (because some bitch on Pinterest assumes you just have things like sesame oil on hand) just throw some sweet child sauce on it. It makes it edible and then you don’t feel like such a failure
2224 2018-11-26 20:52:01 Last time, low oil did not help US economy! Reason, US oil is 8%of GDP(largest by country). Supporting services &oil wages spends then takes it up to, guess, 13-15% of US GDP oil dependent. At these prices, some US oil producers(&GDP) are hurting.#wti #oil #brent @CNBCClosingBell
2225 2018-11-26 20:52:01 Wash your face when you wake up
-this a simple one but it’s really effective. Washing your face can help reduce oil and make your skin look brighter :)
2226 2018-11-26 20:51:52 Cactus oil is good for dry hair. Stress can cause hair loss. Towel dry hair. Is it NISIM or NHB? supposed to stop hair loss. or analogous. How can I uncover the precise web site. Must get it. So outstanding.
2227 2018-11-26 20:51:45 Yes it is but they also have the right not to be invaded and ask for help.. How long that help lasts. And as there may be oil in the vicinity. Well that alters the govt viewpoint.. There were an unheard of harmless dependency until then costing little and chugging along
2228 2018-11-26 20:51:43 Elon lets make sure to never let that happen, why would we want lakes and river dried up the earth would be a niserable place. Its is a good solution none the less but same thing with oil why use it all up. Conserve is the best method!
2229 2018-11-26 20:51:42 Price differential is disastrous for Cdn oil industry and lower world oil prices only exacerbate that. If price of N Dakota or Montana oil is at world price, why is Alberta oil exported to USA is at an even lower price. Suppose because it is largely heavy oil needing high prices.
2230 2018-11-26 20:51:38 If the vitamins don’t do what you want them to, try some rosemary essential oil in a coconut oil (like a hair mask)! Super good for hair growth but also makes your hair super soft  (and pretty cheap)

2232 2018-11-26 20:51:23 UK has already enough turmoil, why is he putting more fire on oil, then when others countries meddle with the US, he's the 1 one to cry a river... And ready to send the army
2233 2018-11-26 20:51:23 Almost exactly wrong. World oil glut and a move by GM to green vehicles are the reasons. Too bad they don't fit in your ideological pigeonhole. How much does Scheer pay you to say such things?
2234 2018-11-26 20:51:09 So I understand, do people think if the transmountain expansion is built, canadian oil will over night be higher? That is amazingly short sighted.
2235 2018-11-26 20:51:07 Already has FDA approval. FDA approved use of mineral oil for expanded trial, so no reason to think expanded label won't come.
2236 2018-11-26 20:51:02 Helps not to have oil I guess.
2237 2018-11-26 20:50:57 Five words:

2238 2018-11-26 20:50:52 I’ll go for an interference pattern - like oil on water.
2239 2018-11-26 20:50:50 All the best parts of christmas will properly burn your house down. 
Like how did my ancestors have lead tinsel and fucking candles and heated mini oil lamps on dead trees for decades and it was okay.
2240 2018-11-26 20:50:41 And that box be slippery like tryna walk on oil
2241 2018-11-26 20:50:40 Too bad you glugged so much oil and fracking money.

2244 2018-11-26 20:50:14 Actually I think we agree, as I said, I don't want to bash Harper, but he also executed policies that killed advanced manufacturing in Ontario in favour of oil and gas + trade w/ China. I've not seen Trudeau fix it, and I am not loyal a Trudeau (or any party). /2

2248 2018-11-26 20:50:04 I wonder if Tom Delay may have, or might still represent OIL interests 
2249 2018-11-26 20:50:00 Recent COT data indicates hedge fund managers cut their bullish bets on #oil to their lowest level in 17 months
2250 2018-11-26 20:50:00 Have you considered that China has some of the biggest oil trading companies and that crude may not go to China? That is what has happened to much of the crude before.China buys but China is not the final destination according to Chinese data.
2251 2018-11-26 20:49:58 I got the oil answer correct. No media enquiries, please. #UniversityChallenge
2252 2018-11-26 20:49:57 Reelection?  LOL  I'm hopeful even trumpers wake up and see the destruction he's causing. If they listen and believe his lies, they're very ignorant.  He's using fear in the same way bush did to be able to divy up oil in Iraq. Trumps end game is different but the path is same.
2253 2018-11-26 20:49:54 Im pretty sure he would welcome them with open arms if they had the amount of oil money the Saudi prince has.
2254 2018-11-26 20:49:47 Maybe he will move there with MBS--for the oil, of course ( they will need to get a McDonalds and KFC to seal the deal).
2255 2018-11-26 20:49:45 Nope! It’s safe to put directly on the soles of their feet. Other oils like Panaway that is used topically for sore muscles, should be used with a carrier oil.
2256 2018-11-26 20:49:44 Started using grape seed oil or avocado oil... canola oil is poison
2257 2018-11-26 20:49:43 Or engine oil
2258 2018-11-26 20:49:42 Just get some good ground chorizo, & cook it up, diced Yukon gold potatoes you cook in the grease with just a bit of oil. Cook em til they are fork tender, but crisp crust. Then scramble the eggs. Put oil in a pan, fry the shells. Put shredded cheese on the bottom, hot sauce. Yum
2259 2018-11-26 20:49:38 Add some butter or olive oil and I'm in.
2260 2018-11-26 20:49:32 Wtf then complain to the oil company
2261 2018-11-26 20:49:28 Except Saudi Arabia. Profits and oil over innocents, as you've so stated.

2265 2018-11-26 20:48:52 Trump's oil policies in Europe have pushed Putin's hand, he's become desperate and more daring, he knows if Europe buys cheap gas& oil from the USA, he'll lose his grip on power, something Putin is not prepared to do.

2269 2018-11-26 20:48:38 15,000 jobs being cut by GM directly caused by your incompetent tariff wars. Stock market tanking as stock prices over-inflated by tax cut funded stock buybacks crash & oil overproduction tanks the energy markets. Your policies have wiped out all of this yr's average 401k growth.
2270 2018-11-26 20:48:37 Help me buy 3 kegs of groundnut oil for my business
2271 2018-11-26 20:48:21 The age of oil is in its twilight years. The number of people who dispute that in this province is frightful. The fact that the front runner to win the next election is among them - and even thinks coal still has a future - is truly terrifying. #ableg

2279 2018-11-26 20:47:18 Looks like the lead singer from Midnight Oil.
2280 2018-11-26 20:47:12 I haven’t gotten an oil change  for over a year... so I finally am getting it done in a couple of days.  I just know that I’m going to apologize profusely, & I’m already embarrassed for my future self.

2284 2018-11-26 20:46:58 Everybody is failing A disaster! I unfairly convicted. He just taken the oil at least 67....
2285 2018-11-26 20:46:37 Sure! Put it on the consumers/citizens to pay for and provide clean water while oil companies continue to irreversibly pollute our clean water supply.
2286 2018-11-26 20:46:28 I would like to compare the monetary incentives for these scientists to those of the politicians who are in the pocket of the oil and gas industry. Is there any research on this?
2287 2018-11-26 20:46:26 Boca vegetarian burgers are

2290 2018-11-26 20:46:12 I was thinking last night about how we're going to run out of natural resources that we need in 10 to 20 years and then there won't be any more oil and then there will be war and then like so many people are going to die and I'm just so pissed off like. We're gonna be alive then
2291 2018-11-26 20:46:04 Nope but why restrict it to one day, it could be your week and this is just the start of it! #sbs
2292 2018-11-26 20:46:01 Berluti and Matthes, would you rather never change a tire again OR never do an air filter+oil change again?
2293 2018-11-26 20:45:57 I’m sure of it too, even TMs tour gives the impression it’s on the cards.
Can’t understand how she can’t see that if she got her deal past the post, The snake oil salesmen will use her as a scapegoat to hide how they conned the public 
2294 2018-11-26 20:45:52 @HarrySmith1212 T on the wing, oil price falling
2295 2018-11-26 20:45:49 recommendations, stays in Canada (what a laugh!) And finds its way into the sectors that need new capital to comply with the new rules. So their model has capital fleeing refining and auto manufacturing and going into upstream oil & gas extraction to finance investments in GHG..4
2296 2018-11-26 20:45:44 They still haven't worked out that Tax on oil is tiny, it's tax on finished goods made from oil that brings in the money.

In addition to that the world is moving away from fossel fuels to electric cars. 

They'll get independence just as nobody wants oil 
2297 2018-11-26 20:45:40 Thank you Steve! So happy to be on board!  #sbs
2298 2018-11-26 20:45:28 South Africa's economy has been riddled with mismanagement & corruption.
Angola's economy is heavily dependent on oil. 
Nigeria's economy has been hit by terrible mismanagement, high level corruption and now volatility in the oil market.
2299 2018-11-26 20:45:23 Marijuana won't help your body pains and you should be wary of cannabinoid oil sales claims. That's what a UofL doc says on "UofL Today w/Mark Hebert" at 6 on @939TheVille #medicinalpot #research
2300 2018-11-26 20:45:10 US President taking credit for low oil prices and thanking Saudi for it.  That is the joke of the year.
2301 2018-11-26 20:45:08 rub me down with that lotion, baby oil me are you ready?
2302 2018-11-26 20:45:04 Congratulations and welcome to #SBS 
2303 2018-11-26 20:45:03 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
2304 2018-11-26 20:44:58 Killing the oil industry doesn't help. Canada is now a bad place to invest. I have been warning everyone to get out of Canadian stocks for a year now and I was right. If you can, see what is happening you are blind
2305 2018-11-26 20:44:57 Thank you Angela. Don't think my evening could get any better. Is the lottery on tonight?! lol #sbs

2308 2018-11-26 20:44:42 the oil industry has been subsidized / propped up with billions in public money for years, and they too come and go as they please with zero accountability
2309 2018-11-26 20:44:41 What about the 100,000 oil workers. No, we won't help them. We will buy the export pipeline and sit on it for 5 years and make certain Alberta goes broke. All talk no action. hopefully, Ontario now understands our issues.
2310 2018-11-26 20:44:21 But substituting soya for palm oil in your biscuits just means that a much larger area of forest gets cleared.  Biofuels and Orang-Utangs are just a distraction from really addressing climate change.

2312 2018-11-26 20:44:19 Im not waiting a week to get an oil change
2313 2018-11-26 20:44:18 Unless there rich, unless they have oil, unless I have a motel there, unless it pisses off Democrats, if there my kids friends........or if they are WHITE
2314 2018-11-26 20:44:11 Doesnt your country have a vast supply of oil??
2315 2018-11-26 20:44:09 on the other hand.... you're disappointed that you can no longer take the hearts of the innocent and pour oil on it and light it up and dance around it like some kind of satanic ritual? we're well aware

2317 2018-11-26 20:43:45 i prefer a bit of bamboo, but i don't mind a bit of darkie, especially if it involves a bit of baby oil, see.
2318 2018-11-26 20:43:37 Like in Alberta where they lead the nation in growth, even with a carbon tax and ridiculously low oil prices?

2320 2018-11-26 20:43:29 The protesters I met either camped there or went up daily and who do you think they were submitting expenses to? These are very active environmentalists or people who desperately do not want an oil spill on the coast. Just normal people. Some first nations.
2321 2018-11-26 20:43:23 Did you know that The UK is the only country in the EU with its own oil?
That's the real reason behind their environmental policy.

2323 2018-11-26 20:43:11 8 years I worked as a clinical adviser to NHS Digital and it is like turning an oil tanker round
2324 2018-11-26 20:43:05 Hope she gets restored and run on the rails while being powered up with oil like the Thomas model from #dayoutwiththomas.
2325 2018-11-26 20:43:04 #oil has been over priced for the last 2 years!  At its current price #WTI $51.61 is still over priced!
2326 2018-11-26 20:43:02 Thank you very much!! #SBS
2327 2018-11-26 20:43:00 lol that Trump thanked himself for falling oil prices. we are suppper blessed to have a climate denier as president #mygoodness #americapls
2328 2018-11-26 20:42:56 You are too kind.  No one in the east gives a rats ass about the job losses in the west due to the liberals sabotaging the oil industry . The ripple effect reaches far and wide here too.
2329 2018-11-26 20:42:55 ...And a lot of Trumps agendas and policies are “driven by the money”. In fact, his dismissive tone towards climate change, is driven by big money, for big oil.
2330 2018-11-26 20:42:52 He’s not our friend. He’s not a comrade. He’ll see us all dead before he stops capitulating with oil firms and fascist Israel.
2331 2018-11-26 20:42:47 Honestly, a measured shift towards viable mass transit, or whatever  turns out to be the best, next horse and buggy = ok, 
Just the oil oligarchs

2333 2018-11-26 20:42:34 I'm not fully informed of other countries policies to reign in this despot. Germany could find another supplier of natural gas and oil.

2336 2018-11-26 20:42:22 Your mum just caught you buying condom.

Reply as a bloody lier..  

As for me: - Na d oil inside it, I wan use 4 my pimples bcuz som1 told me it dey work well 4 pimples. 
2337 2018-11-26 20:42:20 Their pensions would not have been OK. They would have been the responsibility of the new Scottish Government, which was counting on $110 oil forever to fund the entire ed & NHS budgets.
2338 2018-11-26 20:42:10 Yes, sometimes we have to break from it. Try a lavender oil in a mister. It works, I swear. I started art quilting and haven't gone back to it, seems kind of silly maybe. A good deviation or inspiration.
2339 2018-11-26 20:42:07 You can't eat oreos they have  palm oil

2341 2018-11-26 20:42:06 @rangtanforest Im making a goodbye card to send to the CEOs of companies that use palm oil. I'll miss @Hersheys, but I can live without it. 
2342 2018-11-26 20:42:05 For me it’s not about oil, it’s about the environment! Oil is a natural resource why don’t you invest in windmills and solar panels? Scientists can’t predict what’s going to happen with seismic activity if you keep pumping the oil out of the ground! OMG
2343 2018-11-26 20:42:04 If this ever happens, then it is time for a western Canada and eastern Canada. No bloody way should we buy a car company. unless you buy it and shut it all down to stop emissions like you did with the KM pipeline. Trudeau and Butts bought it to control it so no oil flows..
2344 2018-11-26 20:42:01 I'm expecting my Big Oil Christmas bonus. Even put a down payment on the pool.
2345 2018-11-26 20:41:41 Carbon can be priced based on source, no one is suggesting taxing breath. The issue is carbon that is dug up from deep underground (coal, oil, etc) all other carbon released is technically "carbon neutral" as any carbon added to the atmosphere was originally taken from it.
2346 2018-11-26 20:41:40 Those are both life savers. I forgot I had a little coconut oil left too!
2347 2018-11-26 20:41:37 I’ve finally moisturized after a 3-day DROUGHT and oil overproduction HALLELUJAH it feels so good
2348 2018-11-26 20:41:26 he said "OIL" quite loudly there #UniversityChallenge
2349 2018-11-26 20:41:23 Vegetable oil will make it darker
2350 2018-11-26 20:41:20 I’m coming . I need to grab oil and you know 
2351 2018-11-26 20:41:13 You use oil products everyday I guarantee it. Also how disgusting that you have such disregard for fellow Canadians and the economy.
2352 2018-11-26 20:41:08 Peppermint Oil
2353 2018-11-26 20:41:07 Put a drop or three of warm olive oil and let whatever is clogging it unclog and slip out. Virgin olive oil is best. #mykidhasesrissuestoo
2354 2018-11-26 20:41:06 Either, I suppose, since the sticking point for the canola oil truthers seems to be "calling thing by different, fake name that sounds more appealing to consumers".

Though I was thinking of testicles when I wrote the tweet! Haha.
2355 2018-11-26 20:40:52 What a fucking hypocrite. You don’t want a car but tell us who need a car to live that we are outmoded.  Lol good thing you live in a city we’re all your food is brought to you by oil and gas powered transportation. Not to mention made for you by your outmoded fuel source  idiot
2356 2018-11-26 20:40:49 No one tell him that EnviroWhackos fight power companies trying to tie wind farms into the electric grid.
2357 2018-11-26 20:40:47 Again, Trudeau approved the pipeline, how is that ignoring it? Also I was referring to "budget will balance itself" remark, not oil. It's not anti oil, you're jumping to that. I'd prefer the oil be used to make reusable solar panels, electric cars etc. it's a finite resource.
2358 2018-11-26 20:40:42 Lil beauty & health tip for my ladies,  putting coconut oil on your pussy is sooo important. Not only does it prevent ingrown hair but it helps lighten & has antibacterial properties that help fight uti’s, yeast infections & other infections. You’re welcome
2359 2018-11-26 20:40:30 If not there is the coming rally in oil
2360 2018-11-26 20:40:27 How are you going to help oil and gas workers and their families get back on their feet? Are they not as deserving as Ontario auto workers? For shame!
2361 2018-11-26 20:40:26 LOL - mine do that, too - all three of them.
2362 2018-11-26 20:40:25 ベスーベスー！はははやめろってくすぐったい～
2363 2018-11-26 20:40:17 He's in a position to do something or get out of the damn way, instead of appointing more oil cronies to run the interior and EPA.
2364 2018-11-26 20:40:14 What would be the Point in substituting maple syrup for motor oil?? I get the shaving cream and whipped cream thing but this isn’t making sense 
2365 2018-11-26 20:40:11 A THING OF BEAUTY and there's a joke about oil or candles here somewhere. (my menorah is a space shuttle and I am still so baffled that someone else out there wanted to make a space shuttle menorah, I love weird menorahs!)
2366 2018-11-26 20:40:11 It's obviously a load of bollocks. Their won't be any correlation in the way the teams play . He's trying to keep everyone happy and it seems to have worked for now the snake oil merchant .
2367 2018-11-26 20:40:06 君を笑わせるためなら、僕は尻から油を出すよ。
2368 2018-11-26 20:40:06 Why? because the Prince owes you a solid, for ignoring how an American Journalist was murdered on Foriegn Soil, with a Hit Squad and a Hack Saw. Then you bastardized the victim. Yet you brag about falling Oil Prices, your a sick Narcissistic Sociopath and a disgrace, RESIGN.
2369 2018-11-26 20:40:03 He also doesn’t “believe” US Steel isn’t opening 6 new plants or oil prices are dictated by supply and demand.
2370 2018-11-26 20:40:03 Family Nutrition: Pop-Secret #Homestyle this December? Its top two ingredients are #popcorn and partially hydrogenated soybean oil.
2371 2018-11-26 20:39:56 Taking advantage of his vast business knowledge. Snake Oil saleman.
2372 2018-11-26 20:39:54 Great Moment ... Oil has arrived from Spain. Get your hands around.
2373 2018-11-26 20:39:52 How do you take it, I got oil but I cannot stand the taste, () tried a vape pen but heard reports of ‘popcorn’ lungs and I worry that with asthma it’s not really wise!
2374 2018-11-26 20:39:39 following crude oil slide to $50 (?)
2375 2018-11-26 20:39:31 Tosin, you cannot deny the impact of the collapse in global oil prices and the impact on Nigerian economy?  @MBuhari has weathered the shock of the collapse, and made important structural adjustments - investing in small business and agriculture. But more work is needed #PMBX2
2376 2018-11-26 20:39:27 Lavender oil and a piece of amethyst crystal under your pillow :)
2377 2018-11-26 20:39:17 I haven't received my Big Oil check or my Koch Bros check. I'm starting to panic.
2378 2018-11-26 20:39:16 Oh really! Is Trudeaus buddy Dias going to take our hard earned tax  $ for his beloved few?What did Trudeau do for the oil workers ? Not a god forsaken chance that taxpayers will tolerate giving more$ to these auto workers .We will have to walk on Ottawa! Time for action on this!
2379 2018-11-26 20:39:12 Brother Opoju, the Lord said I should tell you that he needs your attention in church on Sunday. Come with your anointing oil. God bless you as you come.
2380 2018-11-26 20:38:57 This one is calling me my baby because of coconut oil, anyway take oil and give me shea butter nio, no story. E say "adiagbon is the best!"
2381 2018-11-26 20:38:44 Yet individual such as self are so afraid to talk about the sales taxYou hope that some magic That oil will once again rescue us.
2382 2018-11-26 20:38:42 @jennifermjones & @PGMcast. As scholars of fake news you might be interested to see one of the actually very few bonafide examples of the genre in Scotland - secret oil fields - has made a comeback. Check out Twitter.
2383 2018-11-26 20:38:41 Probably looking for oil to steal.... The American way
2384 2018-11-26 20:38:39 The oil and the condom aren’t coming into contact, and the lube is water based
2385 2018-11-26 20:38:32 Then a ball-chase is no problem. Did you try the CBD oil?
2386 2018-11-26 20:38:26 Oil brings in less than you'll have to pay on the 220bn debt you'll have to take. Either that or lose all assets to cover the cost.

Can't pay we'll take it away.
2387 2018-11-26 20:38:24 Nice to tweet you too!
2388 2018-11-26 20:38:10 we can solve all the worlds problems with wall tapestry and patchouli oil. open your third eye and do yoga while we align our chakras 
2389 2018-11-26 20:38:06 I used Miss Camaraderie and Jojoba Oil and my face was POPPING. Couldn't keep up cause she's a mess with the deliveries but she seems to be more stable these days might get back on it. You're going to be radiant! <3
2390 2018-11-26 20:38:01 #facts. The USA  has sanctions in place that are causing an economic crisis in these countries. They are an oil base country & should flourish like our economy. Tell @realDonaldTrump to remove these sanctions instead of complaining about poor people walking miles for safety.
2391 2018-11-26 20:38:00 My god , its like the Scottish referendum, people greeting with glee when oil prices fell and now political pundits wishing and gloating that we may not be able to trade with the US, SAD VERY SAD
2392 2018-11-26 20:38:00 ima need the bath and body works Honolulu sun w/ coconut oil in an air freshener, cause disss right here 
2393 2018-11-26 20:37:56 Lol. This place always treats us right but you never know. Oil change only .
2394 2018-11-26 20:37:55 Thank Canada for selling oil to the US for $17 a barrel.
2395 2018-11-26 20:37:54 Well he wasn't exactly an oil painting while he was alive #corrie
2396 2018-11-26 20:37:46 I be old sprinter engine... I go sork the oil all...
2397 2018-11-26 20:37:45 Stress placed on lower socioeconomic demos cannot be solved by adding to their numbers. Access to housing, jobs and assistance won't be solved by just spending more while continually expanding the problem. Winning, making gains demands you first stop losing
2398 2018-11-26 20:37:41 I need an oil change 
2399 2018-11-26 20:37:39 Do the particles in the clear coating reflect light at different depths? (I looked up oil slick rainbows and made some mental leaps)
2400 2018-11-26 20:37:22 Great for my hubby who dropped his phone in oil!
2401 2018-11-26 20:37:20 This report was created by the same type of people who in the 70s predicted that we would run out of oil in 15 to 20 years.
2402 2018-11-26 20:37:18 No, it’s not.  Get oil moving to market
2403 2018-11-26 20:37:18 Hmm good point and Maybe if conservatives agreed to burning trash as an energy source like Sweden does (800k lbs a year) there’d be less marches. 40 countries do this worldwide and the right continues to block it to bolster oil profits.
2404 2018-11-26 20:37:12 That’s motor oil 
2405 2018-11-26 20:37:05 I dont smoke hardly at all anymore.  But I remember
Both of you need to try CBD oil.  Makes my anxiety calm down and sleep like a baby.

2407 2018-11-26 20:36:58 How can someone be bleaching palm oil at this hour? To what end?
2408 2018-11-26 20:36:48 Which means I’ll be taking 1 sip of beer per quarter. Got it. And organic?! Omg yay. But is it sustainable, eco friendly, vegan, and come with complimentary hemp beard oil?
2409 2018-11-26 20:36:46 Lol she say its not for eternity,  just once
2410 2018-11-26 20:36:36 Hahahah kut. Kwalelen ku dai fair boys 
2411 2018-11-26 20:36:34 I had to stop trying bc my eyelids started to swell up. I used coconut oil and baby oil. Neither worked 
2412 2018-11-26 20:36:15 ONE condom?

Non-latex, I hope. #oil
2413 2018-11-26 20:36:11 Boss that be engine oil.

2417 2018-11-26 20:35:57 I realize that every time I feel like I’m gonna have a bad day, I just listen to @lizzo’s coconut oil and realize I’m a bad bitch who can do anything
2418 2018-11-26 20:35:57 Fax. I'm being taught about thread count, doing taxes properly, changing the oil after every 45k miles.... they live a whole different life lol
2419 2018-11-26 20:35:46 Weeell...A bust is a little bit less narcissistic than a wall sized oil painting? Maybe?
2420 2018-11-26 20:35:44 Hi jay how are you?. Question do you use cbd oil to help with recovery
2421 2018-11-26 20:35:41 It’s a forgone conclusion, demand increases, prices fall. Look at computer costs from the 80’s to now. We are literally 1 evolutionary jump in bat technology away from ending reliance on fossil fuels for transport. We’ll need oil for roads and plastics, but not for fuelling cars.

2423 2018-11-26 20:35:28 Yes, various people who praise Norway's social democracy are usually loathe to mention its oil $ and whaling
2424 2018-11-26 20:35:22 this is an old political trick: accuse your opponent of what you are guilty of. Oil, coal and other carbon-heavy industries long ago bought out Congress. Republicans representing Texas, Oklahoma and other states can't get elected without denying climate change.
2425 2018-11-26 20:35:21 Oil scars suck! Had them all up my arm once. So here for the new cooking vids!
2426 2018-11-26 20:35:13 Again his own administration put out this report. Sorry I must have missed it.. where did you get your doctorate from again? There are two groups of people that say climate change doesn’t exist. Oil lobbyist and complete idiots, which one are you?
2427 2018-11-26 20:35:09 This world  is sum else....if the government finds diamonds and oil in yo backyard its government property but if they find drugs its yours #retweet
2428 2018-11-26 20:35:07  I shall be there! #SBS #SBSwinnershour
2429 2018-11-26 20:35:05 Thank you  Beyond excited!
2430 2018-11-26 20:35:02 This is how they roll. Recognizing  sovereignty  is not part of #putinsplaybook Putin will not stop himself. There's a lot of natural gas and oil under Crimea and Eastern Ukraine. Why not take it? NATO's already cracked from Brexit and USA is in the bag.
2431 2018-11-26 20:35:01 Thank you! Glad to be part of the family! x #SBS
2432 2018-11-26 20:34:41 My '14 Ford just turned 134K and I've done nothing but oil changes and tires. This is business model related. Not product related.
2433 2018-11-26 20:34:40 Coating his lips with some oil or butter would help keep them from drying out too, and lasts longer... I learned this as a patient myself. xo
2434 2018-11-26 20:34:39 Thank you Dev! 
2435 2018-11-26 20:34:32 Bought mine just before oil prices rocketed, paid 7k, sold 2 years later when no-one wanted thirsty petrol cars. I've said before, had it been a 530d I might still have it.
2436 2018-11-26 20:34:24 I’m a scientist and I guess I could just go work for an oil company where my data will never be made public or endure peer review but I do like my soul where it is. I have SO enjoyed having oil companies attack my integrity for daring to use data to disagree with them.
2437 2018-11-26 20:34:23 You do know they drill for NG just like oil, right!?!?
2438 2018-11-26 20:34:20 vape oil. Please I must see

2443 2018-11-26 20:33:47 How sweet it is that they post a farming pic!
Oil and energy sector- ruined
Auto sector- trying to ruin
Farming sector- you’re next!

Be a liberal where dismantling a country is our goal!
2444 2018-11-26 20:33:42 I’ll just add that starting now, demand shocks hitting oil won’t be *as* associated with, or the result of, recessions, but rather, the steady rollout of electrification of global transportation.
2445 2018-11-26 20:33:19 “Slate’s book critic Laura Miller,speaking of #metoo,recalled..how badly men had reacted to the 1991 film ‘Thelma & Louise,’ a gorgeous,flawed paean to women’s fury...being particularly upset by the scene in which the 2..blow up the oil tanker..”
GOOD AND MAD

2446 2018-11-26 20:33:19 There was never any doubt that these oil fields were not secret. It's not the job to journalists to Google basic stuff for people on the internet who don't keep up with the news. Google "Clair Ridge". It's not difficult.
2447 2018-11-26 20:33:08  let Picasso be great. I got that oil painting for you lol

2449 2018-11-26 20:32:58 In US, millions of people are directly or indirectly employed by coal, oil and gas. Then many companies & billionaires like Koch brothers bought political support in think tanks, conservative media, Congress. No messenger can impact that bedrock support for denial.
2450 2018-11-26 20:32:55 It’s nice & all to have 2 cars but when you gotta put gas & fucking get oil change for both is like wtf 
2451 2018-11-26 20:32:55 Oil starvation I am guessing. It's a right mess. Overall it's fairly unloved. A can of worms. I replace an engine, then everything else falls apart
2452 2018-11-26 20:32:49 Legacy Of PDP: Nigeria Loses $6bn In Corrupt Oil Deal

Adoke signed the controversial agreement that will make Nigeria lose $6 billion in royalties
2453 2018-11-26 20:32:48 The universe works on electric and magnetic principles. Having the scientists come forward with this would open a HUGE can of worms for the oil companies. STILL, it NEEDS to happen.
2454 2018-11-26 20:32:47 Expensive: oil, gas & electricity. But IMF money did not come.
2455 2018-11-26 20:32:47 If oil prices go down, people will drive more cars and waste more oil. This is wrong! Climate change due to human behavior is real. We burnt oil in 200 years that earth built up in 200 million years! Get down to scientific facts, Mr. President!
2456 2018-11-26 20:32:41 @Itsmercy8 Oil plenty for ya head

2459 2018-11-26 20:32:16 Thank you John, so very kind.
2460 2018-11-26 20:32:06 We need stronger opposition  to the Butts -Trudeau plan to  destroy oil and gas industry.Where is Andrew Scheer? When you are  elected , if it's not too late  we are counting on you.
2461 2018-11-26 20:32:01 Unless you have a lucrative arms and oil deal with them. Then it’s fine apparently.

2468 2018-11-26 20:31:34 wonder how valuations of said sector perform against oil.
interesting chart.
btw i assume this is spot oil?
2469 2018-11-26 20:31:32 all like “lipstick oil” lmao
2470 2018-11-26 20:31:26 We are overloading our atmosphere with carbon dioxide, which traps heat and steadily drives up the planet’s temperature. Where does all this carbon come from? The fossil fuels we burn for energy—coal, natural gas, and oil—plus the loss of forests due to deforestation.
2471 2018-11-26 20:31:11 Who said sneak oil salesman!!
2472 2018-11-26 20:31:08 Yeah... Uve got a nice beard there, very fine. Beard oil is just to nourish it and keep it more healthier.well just advertising to u, pls u can recommend my oil to ur friends abeg..... Plsssss. Kfb pls
2473 2018-11-26 20:31:08 We couldn’t get oil from Mars to Earth economically. Move there to be able to use it,
2474 2018-11-26 20:31:03 There are things like when you have a bath or a shower or even when you do the dishes- I like the apple smell of  dish detergent.  (As an example)  or love the scent and feel of Argan oil in shampoo.   I also make my own soap- I like the feel of soap with goats milk.
2475 2018-11-26 20:31:03 That totally makes sense—I revisited THE INTRUDER WITHIN, an Alien knockoff TV movie set on oil ocean rig, via the same streaming place. Hadn’t seen it since childhood!
2476 2018-11-26 20:31:00 @IcelandFoods I totally applaud your Christmas ad! The best, most powerful piece of advertising ever! I'm gutted it is banned and I don't understand why. Great message and the work of an advertising genius, whoever it is, should be very proud! THANK YOU FOR SAYING NO TO PALM OIL!

2483 2018-11-26 20:30:38  then they must come with an oil rig or land documents. The time is now . Those people must just chill

2486 2018-11-26 20:30:32 Yeah, the Tories have only ever paid lip service to climate change. Banging on about green issues but at the same time giving out licenses for fracking and new oil fields etc. Same story in Scotland sadly.

2512 2018-11-26 20:28:40 Happy Birthday and a huge congrats to you! #sbs
2513 2018-11-26 20:28:33 And Saudi Arabia supplies only 9% of our oil so stop lying about why you cozy up to them, you Sleezebag.

2520 2018-11-26 20:27:55 Well, stopping the oil east & west plus stopping LNG exports to the west
That will get pipelines built pretty damn quick.  It’s convenient for Liberals to say 0 to tidewater when it was there PM that canceled them. PS your PM has 0 too plus 3 canceled, what’s worse now?
2521 2018-11-26 20:27:46 Unless they have oil of course!
2522 2018-11-26 20:27:44 Yup the full tax, not the piddly 8% we get now on Billions of barrels of oil will bring nothing but hyper austerity.. so much so the English can't wait to get rid of us!!!

2526 2018-11-26 20:27:38 It's not just about Oil. That's part of the 40% the 2 Anglophone regions contribute to #Cameroon's Economy.

2529 2018-11-26 20:27:29 If @realDonaldTrump can congratulate himself for falling oil prices, perhaps he will similarly congratulate himself for falling job numbers in the auto sector, while his buddies celebrate making 7% on GM stock the same day. #GeneralMotors
2530 2018-11-26 20:27:22 I don’t either not all of it anyway GREEN IS THE NEW OIL... Said that, we need to protect our planet 
2531 2018-11-26 20:27:21 OMG! If this ever happens then it is time to separate into Western & Eastern Canada.Trudeau can do the same as he did the pipelines..buy GM and shut the doors so there will be no cars produced & less emissions He bought KM to make sure no oil would  flow from it.Taxpayers revolt!
2532 2018-11-26 20:27:11 I have a self portrait in oil paint due tomorrow and I haven’t started lol
2533 2018-11-26 20:27:09 Like, if you need 5 milliliters of oil (about a teaspoon), how would you do that without a standard measuring spoon
2534 2018-11-26 20:27:06 That's the challenge.

Any oil majors or mids listening out there??
2535 2018-11-26 20:26:58 My guess is that more than half of folks under 30 who claim to be socialist don't really know what socialism is. The checks that every resident of the state of Alaska receives each year from oil companies seem to me a perfect example.
2536 2018-11-26 20:26:49 It’s an irrelevant point, would a fresh start with that oil help 100 years ago? Good chance. Now? Fuck all relevance. Support for independence is falling and has been since 2014 (as long as you listen to every single credible poll and not The National).
2537 2018-11-26 20:26:48 Thanks Sarah!! 
2538 2018-11-26 20:26:34 In the 70s the reason we have a good GDP is because industries moved to Nigeria cause of one thing which is Power( electricity). We had cocoa, and lots of farm produce. But then everything changed- it is crude oil or nothing . Buhari is saying no, we have to go green to grow !
2539 2018-11-26 20:26:34 I have since 17..maybe try CBD oil..it helps with inflammation and pain
2540 2018-11-26 20:26:33 NOT opinions at all. Trump has no influence on prices. And his ass kissing of the Saudis means little because they only supply 9% of our oil.
Hyde Smith NOT respected by all as you admitted.
Saudi not our battle? Maybe so but CIA says the most likely did it.
2541 2018-11-26 20:26:27 if conservatives were truly conservative, wouldn't saving the planet be a major priority? And why do the Evangelicals take the side of big oil and not, you know, God's creation?

2546 2018-11-26 20:25:59 same but can I just have the weed oil in it.
2547 2018-11-26 20:25:52 Got a new phone and changed my oil. Oml I feel so brand new
2548 2018-11-26 20:25:51 Check engine you probably need an oil change

2554 2018-11-26 20:25:25 The world is funny, if the government finds diamonds or oil in your backyard, it’s government property. but if they find drugs, it’s yours.
2555 2018-11-26 20:25:24 If you believe that I've got a story about how oil oozes, inexhaustibly from the earth's core using centrifugal force to sell you ... oh wait, that was Jerome Corsi too...
2556 2018-11-26 20:25:11 Ой, а у нас сегодня утром снег валил, сразу настроение такое джинглбелсное:)
2557 2018-11-26 20:25:10 Perhaps to resolve this argument over who is getting "paid" they should do a count of who has more yachts, academic scientists or oil executives?
2558 2018-11-26 20:25:10 Putin is taking the oil in Syria plain and simple overseen by Putin. Ukraine had 3 sham elections. Obama slapped crippling sanctions for interfering in Ukraine that Putin wants Trump to take off but he is handcuffed.
2559 2018-11-26 20:25:10 Things are becoming expensive, the time is NOW! From 2020 they will be worth the price of oil and gold.
2560 2018-11-26 20:25:09 Wallahi it works 
2561 2018-11-26 20:25:02 Thanks my lovely! xx
2562 2018-11-26 20:25:00 Congrats #SBS winners @The_Oil_Hut @NibblenOften @snappguides @AdventureCrtrs @regiftwrap @ChiChiCardsUK Have a buzzin wk ahead
2563 2018-11-26 20:24:59 one definite side-effect of reading labels for palm oil is making your own yummy things. (this is a good and a bad thing. because suddenly you have all these delicious things at your fingertips!)
2564 2018-11-26 20:24:53 When I first started deep conditioning with Shea moisture’s Jamaican black castor oil deep conditioner, hot oil treatment, Protein treatments for balance and strength, and keep your hands out your hair!
2565 2018-11-26 20:24:48 The 'peel as you go' as you call it was a complete failure on my unwich. I don't know how much difference that would have made as the oil/vinegar had run and soaked through pretty much all the wrapping (both layers).
2566 2018-11-26 20:24:40 Cbd oil coffee time.. 
But first shower.
2567 2018-11-26 20:24:40 Even better! And no bottles of dirty oil to dispose of.
2568 2018-11-26 20:24:38 He’ll be putting you in jail you bent snake oil salesman..
2569 2018-11-26 20:24:15 Thank you!! I'll raise a North East lager or something! lol #SBS
2570 2018-11-26 20:24:02 @GM #restructure needs to develop more electric or solar powered vehicles to eliminate heavy reliance on oil. We could export them to countries who are at the mercy of oil producing countries in the Mideast.
2571 2018-11-26 20:23:55 I am even using extra-strength CBD oil drops, so I am sure that the one I am taking has a pretty high potency and MG. However, it is not doing the job for me 100%. So, I intend to continue the search for solutions.
2572 2018-11-26 20:23:48 Trumpies and class, like oil and water.
2573 2018-11-26 20:23:43 Like that earthy note point.. The spice and oil etc gives that note that's great.

2574 2018-11-26 20:23:11 Drafts

sauteing my pussy in cbd oil
2575 2018-11-26 20:23:10 - Very high pony tail(Basically on top of your head)

-Half up/half down, (try using a scrunchie it hides the extra hair)

-Flower crown braids or twists (Try starting from a middle part and braiding out to the ears)

-Using Gel, water, coconut oil, etc for slicing back!
2576 2018-11-26 20:23:08 Suspended from Facebook for sharing a video about hemp seed oil. Very weird.
2577 2018-11-26 20:23:04 Indescribable!! It feels so damn good!! I'm so happy, #SBS
2578 2018-11-26 20:22:53 I think the beard oil is his favorite (and probably mine too lol) it smells so good and works great.
2579 2018-11-26 20:22:49 What kind of eco styler?? The Argan oil and coconut oil ones are crack
2580 2018-11-26 20:22:40 Minding me Nanna’s house n just rang her to see if there was anymore oil (cooking oil) n she said nor but if it’s for your face there’s some E45 in the cupboard. I’m sorry wat??
2581 2018-11-26 20:22:32 S....s.....ssss.. soy

sauce mixed with spicy sesame oil
2582 2018-11-26 20:22:27 Same. @tambright15 got me a Fisher Space Pen last year. It'll write upside down, under water, over oil and ZERO GRAVITY! Because you never know when you're going to lose gravity.
2583 2018-11-26 20:22:24 Lemon eucalyptus oil I've heard it works like a charm against mosquitoes natural repellent.
2584 2018-11-26 20:22:24 Interesting that trump has pushed oil prices down again. Seems keen to letting it free fall
2585 2018-11-26 20:22:17 Is that what happens if someone poured peanut oil on your face
2586 2018-11-26 20:22:17 I'd better not push it at this early stage 
2587 2018-11-26 20:22:17 All my black friends expect my hair to get long in 5 months these niggas think my hair got some type of special oil 
2588 2018-11-26 20:22:15 You can actually make homemade deodorant from baking soda and either she’s butter or coconut oil plenty of recipes online and all natural
2589 2018-11-26 20:22:03 Yes yes, I’ve read your article. Watched your video, no need to keep repeating your message. I don’t know why North Sea oil companies need the money because they make billions. So, why do they need any money from the tax payer?
2590 2018-11-26 20:21:56 Bravo. Gutsy and a line in the sand. It will be easy for them to spend the money LNP has collected in graft and from corrupted land developers and big coal, gas and oil & not be beholding to the tobacco, alcohol and gambling industry, on hospitals, schools, public transport
2591 2018-11-26 20:21:49 AS LONG AS TRUMP AND THE GOP ARE FUNDED BY BIG OIL, THEY WILL CONTINUE TO DENY AND LOOK THE OTHER WAY FROM THE SCIENCE AND THE CONTINUAL INCREASE IN CATASTROPHIC EVENTS THAT ARE KILLING PEOPLE AND DESTROYING THE AIR WE BREATHE.
2592 2018-11-26 20:21:45 Oh no, that will come after we terraform it and open Jurassic Park just to bury it in man-made disasters so they decompose into oil. THEN, Earth 2 will have oil.

I wish I didn't believe my own sarcasm.
2593 2018-11-26 20:21:43 He's dead wrong.   Wouldn't they make much more money working for the oil companies? 

Nobody goes into climate science for the big bucks...it's ludicrous.
2594 2018-11-26 20:21:35 finally ordered some rosehip oil. cure my face please!!!!
2595 2018-11-26 20:21:32 US #crude #oil ends the day up at 51.49 a gain of 2.4% #Commodities #markets #WallStreet #Finance #investing #investments #economy
2596 2018-11-26 20:21:31 White people love letting the hood of their car slam after they check the oil & saying “it’s all good in the hood”
2597 2018-11-26 20:21:30 Thiza wam ndinabalandeli baseNaija, yiNaija yonke. And ayiyo laNaija ine oil
2598 2018-11-26 20:21:23 If i use beard oil on what i have already. The beards go dey sweep ground
2599 2018-11-26 20:21:14 Given Butt's agenda you are not really surprised. Why will no one confront Quebec's hypocrisy on Energy East as oil tankers cruise up the St. Lawrence to deliver Saudi oil to Montreal.
2600 2018-11-26 20:21:05 Olbas Oil is a god send
2601 2018-11-26 20:21:03 Thank you Andy!!! I shall be contacting Dylan very soon for some goodies!! #SBS
2602 2018-11-26 20:20:54 Yeah, if Brampton and Ingersoll close over the next 2 years what was all the effort about? Here's a flash: the oil will still be worth shipping when all the plants are shut. Priorities.
2603 2018-11-26 20:20:49 @realDonaldTrump is mad at @GM for shutting 7 plants.
Wonder if he will be mad when oil companies lay off workers in oil patch?
Also wonder if he will be mad when HFT Price Controls by a collusive Fed/Treasury lead to chaotic price increases. There are consequences for actions.
2604 2018-11-26 20:20:48 It only shows ur shallow knowledge about d working of oil and gas industries. What is d combined capacity of all our refineries and daily consumption of petroleum products? It's pple like u dat makes penny in actual but claimed u makes naira in reality.
2605 2018-11-26 20:20:42 (ig. @ cloudyy.threadss)

-tsp brown sugar

-1/2 tsp vitamin e

-tsp sugar
-1/2 tsp pureed kiwi
-tsp olive oil 
-1/4 tsp coconut oil
2606 2018-11-26 20:20:40 I think the problem is the oil revenue doesn't benefit any part of the UK.
2607 2018-11-26 20:20:33 No war for (coconut) oil.
2608 2018-11-26 20:20:18 “See that shiny building over there”
“You mean the one that says ‘McHubs R Us’?”
“Yep, that used to be a publicly funded & managed library”
“What went wrong?”
“Ah the OBE chasing snake oil merchants gained control”
“Tragic”
“Yep”
2609 2018-11-26 20:20:18 It genetic and it no big deal, if u remove it, it will regrow as grey hair. So leave it and learn to flaunt it, pls contact me for ur beard oil, I produce nourishing beard oil.
2610 2018-11-26 20:20:14 The world is funny. If the government finds oil or diamonds in your back garden its government property. But it they find drugs it’s yours 
2611 2018-11-26 20:20:12 And yet when they kill an American journalist you're totally chill with it as long as they keep our oil prices lower. You are a spineless slime with the constitution of a dead leaf
2612 2018-11-26 20:20:11 I'm with you! But first I'd like to thank Canada for our low gas prices since they are our biggest suppliers of oil.
2613 2018-11-26 20:20:08 And the anointing oil is ketchup.
2614 2018-11-26 20:20:02 Is the FG pursuing any court process concerning this issue in Nigeria?

More importantly, what are we doing to bring the oil from this field to the market rather than celebrating court cases in UK and Italy?

Nigeria's oil may not be as attractive as it once was. Timing is key!
2615 2018-11-26 20:20:00 Gentle aromatherapy massage gets a Xmas make-over with clove, ginger and frankincense oils Clove oil aids your immune system, fights all kinds of infections

2616 2018-11-26 20:20:00 Aww, thank you so much. Best day of my business life!!! xx
2617 2018-11-26 20:19:58 You do realize that the Tariffs imposed on Canada was put in place by declaring Canada a security threat. Canada a security threat. JFC Canada supplies 4 times more oil than the Saudi’s but Canada is the threat?
2618 2018-11-26 20:19:51 Once when I was eating some noodles with chili oil on them, I whipped a glob into my eye when I slurped. I was more-or-less incapacitated for about 10 minutes, and that was one small amount of spice that was edible.
2619 2018-11-26 20:19:18 What's gonna happen when the dan vs Phil board is full? Is the world going to end?
2620 2018-11-26 20:19:18 Folks in Alberta who love 45 and bitch about the low price of oil.  Fucking  priceless.
2621 2018-11-26 20:19:07 CBD oil can work differently for everyone though. I still would recommend for people to give it a try if they struggle in any certain way where CBD oil could possibly help. I have only heard positive feedback from anyone who has taken it who I’ve spoken with about it! :)
2622 2018-11-26 20:19:00 I feel like McLellan did and that's why Chia is still with the Oil and Todd isn't
2623 2018-11-26 20:18:58 オイルはギトギトというイメージを拭い去ろうか。時にはサラサラし、時にはギトギト。オイルはいつだって君のそばにいるのさ。
2624 2018-11-26 20:18:55 Well, I mean, the pipeline purchase looks like a great idea st this time given the skyrocketing price of oil. Governments only pick winners!
2625 2018-11-26 20:18:41 Reminder that Canada is a net exporter of oil. we make more than we consume. Oil companies decide where it goes and for how much, not trudeau, not notley.
2626 2018-11-26 20:18:39 Oil prices always drop around this time...not because of you so stop the drama... you still no hero...!!!
2627 2018-11-26 20:18:35 Congratulations everyone and welcome to the #SBS family!
2628 2018-11-26 20:18:16 Your opinions. No facts. Who was responsible for oil prices dropping? Dems aren’t at the root of the immigration problems? So Hyde Smith isn’t liked by everyone, so what? As far as Saudi Arabia, not our battle. Keep watching CNN so you’ll continue to become more and more stupid.
2629 2018-11-26 20:18:16 Sounds like your post needs some freedom for the oil.
2630 2018-11-26 20:18:11 Congrats everyone :)
2631 2018-11-26 20:17:59 Estos tipos evade y eluden más que OIL Combustibles

2633 2018-11-26 20:17:45 Because taking into considering health and social impacts is such a bad idea..  well , maybe to oil mongers it is, anyways.
2634 2018-11-26 20:17:44 Thank you very much! So looking forward to being part of the #SBS family!
2635 2018-11-26 20:17:44 I have been using GenM Magnosteen Pericarp Oil for my skin for several months! Love this stuff! Check it out:

2636 2018-11-26 20:17:41 One can hope that a collapse of the oil & gas sector will take some of the hot air out of those gasbags.
2637 2018-11-26 20:17:32 Indeed it is sad. Seemingly oil & water.

2641 2018-11-26 20:16:55 If the majority of Americans who acknowledge the reality of climate change and advocate action now would simply stop driving and flying, we would be a long ways towards a solution. 

Added bonus: Oil demand down = price down and hurts the Saudis and Putin.
2642 2018-11-26 20:16:42 Got my oil changed. Bought more Christmas presents for cyber Monday. I’m not spending money until I get paid. Maybe.
2643 2018-11-26 20:16:38 Jeff Besos, who owns the Washington Post allowed him to write the articles in order to slam the Saudi prince over underlined intentions, he wants there to be sanctions out on them to jack up oil prices and put the tedious U.S. and global economy into a recession.
2644 2018-11-26 20:16:36 I love cnn. They have all the solutions.Just no procedure on how to achieve it. Like Donna B. When the deep horizon had an oil spill. “Someone needs to turn the oil flow off”.

2653 2018-11-26 20:16:14 Oil change needs to come with a fill up
2654 2018-11-26 20:16:06 Trump does not have beliefs per se. In this case he 'does not believe it' because he wants to line the pockets of his coal and oil friends.
2655 2018-11-26 20:16:03 Alaskans own 996,100 shares of ESSO THAILAND PCL, worth $318,868. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in THAILAND.
2656 2018-11-26 20:15:54 Oil is a fossil fuel it comes from decomposing organic material. Meaning find oil it means there was once life.
2657 2018-11-26 20:15:53 awareness of the lunch... the dummy brought snacks too??  ball bearings and an oil can?
2658 2018-11-26 20:15:51 i heard baby oil was good??
2659 2018-11-26 20:15:42 Thanks so much! Over the moon....2000 times!!! #SBS
2660 2018-11-26 20:15:31 I like to put some olive oil when i cooked the pasta can also put after you rinsed it to avoid it becomes sticky
2661 2018-11-26 20:15:27 Great to see #sbs is growing in Europe too!
2662 2018-11-26 20:15:27 I agree but the sands are shifting. More and more nations will start adopting carbon taxes or similar nudge tactics

The attractions of 'first mover' will be being weighed with 'he who goes second makes the money'

Whatever, it will be hard to make the transition w/o the oil Cos.
2663 2018-11-26 20:15:26 GM is no angel either. They sucked up 2 Big Oil for years. They could have done much better than the Volt to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. They were part of their own problem and should own it.
2664 2018-11-26 20:15:18 Where's your deep disappointment on your failure to get our oil to the coast by killing pipelines? What's your plan to save the economy? Withdraw C-69!!! You have brought this on! #resign
2665 2018-11-26 20:15:18 Why the heck would @CNN have Tom delaybin for anything other than how to break election finance law & gerrymander a state to death? He’s certainly not qualified to talk about climate change. Anyone aka who is paying him these days? Big oil perhaps?
2666 2018-11-26 20:15:15 The gun lobby, the oil lobby and the auto industry lobby all walk into a bar. 

Wait. It was the voting booth. 

Oh man I always mess these up 

It’s coming ... #Election2019 #LetsVote
2667 2018-11-26 20:15:10 I'm sorry  rub palm oil
2668 2018-11-26 20:15:08 That doesn't account for all our products that UK take and sell under thier guise though does it? nor does it apply the £400billion+ surplus UK makes from Scottish waters not English almost seems like even with oil at its lowest, Scotland would be worth more than England is.
2669 2018-11-26 20:14:56 Thank you for your kind words 
2670 2018-11-26 20:14:42 Progressive policies rather than being complimentary, work in direct contradiction to one another. Generous social programs, 21st century economy and migration policies cannot be successful if synchronicity btwn them not taken into acct when making policy
2671 2018-11-26 20:14:35 AOC would be a major target then she already is. Green Jobs is the next best thing but Americans are addicted to oil, and old ass political figures have corporate money funding them.
2672 2018-11-26 20:14:29 Yea I use that sometimes, but it causes too much acid for me many times to use a lot. My synthroid (recently got thyroid out) was causing me to bloat any time I ate food at all and peppermint oil was the difference between sucking it up and dealing vs going to the ER from it.
2673 2018-11-26 20:14:29 Need the prices at the pump to drop too, oil comp. raking in our hard earn dollars. Tired of paying too much.

2678 2018-11-26 20:14:18 Dear Premier: I voted for your party; I am a geoscientist in oil patch in yyc; business/economy are important but if indutry, government, society all only advocate for that, who advocates for our environment? For future generations’ environment? We need to support bill C-69
2679 2018-11-26 20:14:14 BBC reported that a former President of Nigeria was involved in the $6bn case of oil fraud being tried in an Italian court.

The former President is Goodluck Ebele 'Nnamdi' Jonathan. 

No going back to Egypt

2684 2018-11-26 20:13:56 cbd oil.. that shit takes the pain out of anything
2685 2018-11-26 20:13:56 The finger pointing is hiding the kernel of truth. Money corrupts. Oil company executives are the highest paid liars on Earth. There are more former oil executives in government than there are in oil companies. Oil companies threaten our lives. We need existential accountability.
2686 2018-11-26 20:13:56 Natural Aloe Vera is good for your scalp. Do not comb wet hair rigorously. Cactus oil is good for dry hair. Is it NISIM or NHB? A good hair loss shampoo. or analogous. I can't seem to come across the legitimate site. Excellent stuff. Very mild.

The United States is back in the Middle East
- as before, it's not about politics but about oil

The purpose of Donald Trump's interference with Saudi Arabia
and the evasion of the nuclear agreement with Iran is to block Iranian access
2689 2018-11-26 20:13:44 Maybe because their use of palm oil that kills forests in Indonesia was recently exposed and they need people to look the other way ? But hey @Oreo, we won't 
2690 2018-11-26 20:13:43 Still can't believe it. Thank you so much and congrats to all #SBS winners this evening!!!
2691 2018-11-26 20:13:43 YES!! As someone who's taught in many a Jewish preschool, Chanukah is not our most important holiday, nor is it all about presents. You can teach a developmentally appropriate science unit about light or oil. Do math with the number eight!  Sorry, I also have Feelings. 
2692 2018-11-26 20:13:42 Everyone gets dupped by a snake oil salesman at one point or another.  We can do our best to help new streamers to stop using retweet bots but sometimes you just can't make that horse drink.
2693 2018-11-26 20:13:39 Those threads are sick. Oilers take note.  Those dark blue mains is what needs to happen for the Oil.  Move the Orange to third.

2695 2018-11-26 20:13:32 Congratulations and well done to the winners. Enjoy the great exposure for your business
2696 2018-11-26 20:13:30 Canadian Oil at $ 11.25  !
Thanks @JustinTrudeau  !
2697 2018-11-26 20:13:23 Those highways are slippery AF though.  No rain for 6 months = Black Ice from oil deposits
2698 2018-11-26 20:13:23 the squeaky door gets the oil
2699 2018-11-26 20:13:13 Kirkland Organic Coconut Oil, Zone Perfect Nutrition Bar Variety, Nutiva Organic Chia Seeds, Disney Organic Apples Gala, Kirkland Bacon Crumbles
2700 2018-11-26 20:13:11 It is complete pandemonium at Morgan Oil where gas is $1.99 a gallon

nutella
-tsp muscavado sugar
-1/2 tsp nutella
-1/2 tsp honey
coconut 
-tsp caster sugar
-1/2 tsp coconut oil 
-1/4 tsp corn flour/starch
2703 2018-11-26 20:13:02 Nop l only use tissue oil at night
2704 2018-11-26 20:12:57 Um turn around and go to whataburger. For some reason, the oil they use makes my tongue feel coated and my throat kinda tingly and coated. I cant enjoy their food. Their parfaits are alright and their coffee is good.
2705 2018-11-26 20:12:53 Imagine going to hell for a small lie like "I use only pears baby oil on my skin".
2706 2018-11-26 20:12:46 While you are denying Climate Change, the world is suffering.  Get your head out of your butt and oil companies butts, and wake up.  It may be too late!
2707 2018-11-26 20:12:45 It’s never too late to start making art...
Palm oil plantations sounds like a great idea-I’ve a couple of students exploring environmental issues in Y11 too.
2708 2018-11-26 20:12:43 I am particularly gob-smacked as this is the first time I've tried! Wow, just wow! Honoured #SBS
2709 2018-11-26 20:12:36 all in the name of OIL RESOURCES.
2710 2018-11-26 20:12:27 If u need your oil change the correct way.. dm me for price.. reasonable prices  #AAMU
2711 2018-11-26 20:12:26 If a cars are not doing well so sales are down & ppl are not buying - unlikely low oil prices changed that positive sentiment in such short order - that’s something else driving  i.e interest rate & probably banks have restricted underwriting  loans due to credit quality
2712 2018-11-26 20:12:24 Mexico makes more money from remittances than oil
2713 2018-11-26 20:12:22 #AngelEyes Crude oil coming in via railway to USA refineries are no risk to habitat? These elitist opinions are not set from the people’s realities. It’s time you all come down to Earth.
2714 2018-11-26 20:12:21 I volunteered to help another viet vet get his $mill.business thru an extreme winter to keep his business competin durin last lil oil boom..all below frigid temp winter long too.
2715 2018-11-26 20:12:20 Oil up them repeaters boys
2716 2018-11-26 20:12:16 @PresChoice can you confirm if the Palm Oil used in your products does not contribute deforestation? Tried to buy popcorn and realized all of your options contain Palm Oil.
2717 2018-11-26 20:12:09 And Quebec blocks energy east while the oil tankers from Saudi continue to cruise up the St. Lawrence. Scheer and the MSM will not confront the hypocrisy.
2718 2018-11-26 20:12:07 Yay!! Congrats to you also!! Amazing! #SBS
2719 2018-11-26 20:12:04 Yes,  the economy isn’t booming and Trump pushing the oil price down won’t help but it’s not just about the money and Putin’s survival- it’s his mindset.
2720 2018-11-26 20:12:00 Trump lied when he took credit for lower oil prices.
Trump lied when he said Cindy Hyde Smith is respected by all.
Trump lied when he said that the immigration problem was caused by Dems.
Trump lied when he said there was no way to know if Saudi prince ordered murder of Kashoggi.
2721 2018-11-26 20:11:59 Yes his skin like mine ... family dollar or Walmart. That coconut oil & aloe will definitely help him.
2722 2018-11-26 20:11:57 Congrats on #SBS win @The_Oil_Hut @NibblenOften @snappguides @AdventureCrtrs @regiftwrap & @ChiChiCardsUK enjoy your utterly bonkers week in the spotlight!
2723 2018-11-26 20:11:56 Perhaps too rich in mercury, microplastics and crude oil? Considering the stuff mankind has been trying to fill up the earth's wet places with?
2724 2018-11-26 20:11:51 The official solution is a pencil instead of this evil oil derivative 
2725 2018-11-26 20:11:50 Much wine!!!
2726 2018-11-26 20:11:46 It works because Pyrex and oil have the same refractive index :)
2727 2018-11-26 20:11:32 Thank you Tracey!! So happy to be a part of #SBS
2728 2018-11-26 20:11:14 When PTi formed a Government, the Oil price was above US $70/barrel and in Pakistan, it was around Rs 90. Now it's below $50 and in Pakistan, it's around Rs 98. But the important part is, Kaptaan's first speech made me cry. His smile makes me happy and he only has 3 suits :(
2729 2018-11-26 20:11:13 Even that is destroying habitats, what about no palm oil usage, find an alternative?
2730 2018-11-26 20:11:13 Thank you John! I've been trying for over 3 years, so I can honestly say dreams DO come true!! #SBS
2731 2018-11-26 20:11:07 I used to mix Citronella oil with Aqueous cream. Perfect for kids and adults alike. Sttange smell but you get used to it.
2732 2018-11-26 20:11:05 Unless they have massive oil reserves.
2733 2018-11-26 20:11:02 yes it does! THANK YOU <3 feelin MUCH better thank the universe for peppermint oil!!!!
2734 2018-11-26 20:11:01 Have you met do you know @FreeRangeChalet ? #sbs
2735 2018-11-26 20:10:57 I love it. We'd get like baby diapers, motor oil, a pregnancy test, and a plunger.
2736 2018-11-26 20:10:54 How about these Oil Prices? Am I right? #GOP #DEMOCRAT #MAGA #Monday #Gaspricesgoingdown
2737 2018-11-26 20:10:46 is this new mars probe gonna tell us if theres oil on mars
2738 2018-11-26 20:10:44 I get Jamaican castor oil you dey like?
2739 2018-11-26 20:10:42 over here in USA we have Oil of Olay...but then we also have Oil of Delay
2740 2018-11-26 20:10:42 Not exactly sure how the Hextall firing would make the Oilers more likely to move on Chiarelli. They don't need someone to go first before pulling the trigger, they have plenty of reasons to do it.
2741 2018-11-26 20:10:38 Wow - thank you! What a fabulous birthday gift !
2742 2018-11-26 20:10:37 So thrilled for you Emily 
2743 2018-11-26 20:10:20 リーダータバコは体に良くないッスよー？
2744 2018-11-26 20:10:03 泣いてなんかいないよ、これは心の油だ。
2745 2018-11-26 20:09:53 Im in Canada I just put a few drops of weed oil under my tongue 30 mins before bed time ;)
2746 2018-11-26 20:09:51 I was expecting 3x the increase in oil of ~2.28
2747 2018-11-26 20:09:48 @BP_Azerbaijan and @SOCARofficial -KBR JV intend to start in mid-2019 the construction of upper modules and supporting block of a production platform in the framework of the Central-East Azeri project, which is included in the #AzeriChiragGuneshli (ACG) oil and #gas fields’ block
2748 2018-11-26 20:09:45 he probably doesn't even want *all* of Ukraine, just Ukrainian ports on the Black Sea and the pipelines that connect Russia to those ports (so that he can make even more money off of selling gas and oil)
2749 2018-11-26 20:09:37 Have you tried cbd oil?
2750 2018-11-26 20:09:35 Thank you for tweeting us. The promotion in reference is only available on qualifying vehicles and covered up to 5 quarts of conventional oil.
2751 2018-11-26 20:09:23 If GM is going full electric what does that say about the future demand for oil? #cdnpoli #pnpcbc #BNN
2752 2018-11-26 20:09:23 Whoop!! Thank you Anita!! You don't know how happy I am right now!! Well, you probably so! LOL xx #SBS
2753 2018-11-26 20:09:21 Space oil is waaaay cooler than earth oil tho
2754 2018-11-26 20:09:15 I have has arthritis since 17..not great ar almost 50. Cbd oil helps my pain..thank God
2755 2018-11-26 20:09:10 Have a great evening tonight- be warned you could be in for a mad few days #sbs
2756 2018-11-26 20:09:09 Wow, thank you! #SBS #smallbiz
2757 2018-11-26 20:09:08 If the price of oil has plummeted why is unleaded (91) $1.64 a litre in Cairns?
2758 2018-11-26 20:09:01 You got your own pump or something? You got oil? Share
2759 2018-11-26 20:09:00 Well done! ♡
2760 2018-11-26 20:08:56 Agreed with final phrase. Thus need to modify first sentence to "The oil companies will need nuclear..."
They don't need it now. They have more available oil and gas than they can sell at the moment. They are not required to pay for CO2 disposal in most places.
2761 2018-11-26 20:08:54 Propane and propane acrssories. I mean... it’s not hat far off. It was amonjkm nitrate and a chain reaction with the chemkcal processing playts of the region, including oil, gas and propane. Resulting in the one of the largest non nuclear explposuons in history.
2762 2018-11-26 20:08:53 my dad is making me get my oil changed by myself & im so nervous like why is he making me be an adult ??? why can’t i be his spoiled princess for life ???
2763 2018-11-26 20:08:35 So a video is going around of "food photography" that uses dish soap and engine oil etc. 

I'd rather call it stock photography because thats what it is. Intended to be sold to a wider market which is why takeaways typically have the same photos on the menu's. But, lots don't!
2764 2018-11-26 20:08:33 I lil drop of peppermint oil in your water or some ginger tea
2765 2018-11-26 20:08:28 Rose oil got me smelling like an actual candle
2766 2018-11-26 20:08:22 I am very much looking forward too #sbswinnershour tomorrow! Thank you!
2767 2018-11-26 20:08:21 So, I have been taking CBD oil drops for a little over two weeks now. So far, I have only felt improvements with the intensity of my anxiety and anxious feelings. However, my anxiety has not completely disappeared, and I still worry about the same things that trigger the anxiety.
2768 2018-11-26 20:08:17 oil is just liquid coal
2769 2018-11-26 20:08:16 Ok so on my break I’m get new windshields and an oil change
2770 2018-11-26 20:08:13 Wow! Thank you  and congratulations to the other winners this week. Looking forward to being part of the #sbs community.
2771 2018-11-26 20:08:12 Please try cbd oil..it has helped me so much..I took opioids for years and they stopped just like that ..I had to find relief..CBD helps .
2772 2018-11-26 20:08:05 Well done  x
2773 2018-11-26 20:08:04 Given that oil is formed by compressed organic materials, it would actually be really super cool if they did.
But yah.
2774 2018-11-26 20:07:55 Todays idiot task- Scaled your palm with boiling hot oil? CHECK!
2775 2018-11-26 20:07:54 Is the oil chart telling us we have a massive inventory build coming?
2776 2018-11-26 20:07:53 Well done 
2777 2018-11-26 20:07:46 “Is your oil device a vape pen” lmaoooo real talk my dude 
2778 2018-11-26 20:07:45 Vitamin d and  omega 3 oil #AVogelWinterHealth
2779 2018-11-26 20:07:41 Don’t worry- the oil and gas companies will help him
2780 2018-11-26 20:07:38 If they do all they will care about is creating robotic drillers and light speed oil tankers. Which would resulting in another couple 100 years of oil companys controlling the world and ruining the earth's atmosphere.
2781 2018-11-26 20:07:35 While I was getting my oil chnaged today the man asked me do I want to change my air filter "for how much?" $29.99 "Naw , im good love". You better go wipe the dirt off with a towel cuz im broke broke!
2782 2018-11-26 20:07:31 My mom & older sister keeps experimenting with banana bread recipes and apparently my mom adds olive oil in it instead of butter and when asked why she does that she says "Butter has too many calories. Olive oil is better. Plus italians put olive oil in their bread all the time"
2783 2018-11-26 20:07:30 wouldnt finding oil on mars prove that at one time organic life existed there? that'd be really awesome from a sci-fi stand point. also come on, imagine a galactic big texas oil mogul. his spaceship has big long horn horns on the front & hes fixin to make a million on "red gold"
2784 2018-11-26 20:07:29 Me too!! How exciting! #SBS
2785 2018-11-26 20:07:27 Just came across your tweet, and your encouraging thoughts couldn’t be more timely for me.  Retiring this week at 66 after 40 years in healthcare mgmt. Have artistic bent (oil painting), loved my English major, and promised myself I would write, come what may. Thank you.
2786 2018-11-26 20:07:25 no tears for Alberta oil patch ?
2787 2018-11-26 20:07:19 Fuck palm oil
2788 2018-11-26 20:07:15 The real stupidity is @JustinTrudeau continually blaming Harper as if he was still the PM?!?!? It’s the LP incompetence that they couldn’t adjust to the boom of the USA & the prosperity that follows. Now OPEC vs the USA in an oil war will devastate AB further.
2789 2018-11-26 20:07:12 Wait until oil drillers all start filing bankruptcy when oil plummets to $20 a barrel.
We saw this before in 2014. Be careful what you wish for.
2790 2018-11-26 20:07:00 The oil tank is nearly as big as the cabin! What kind of heater is it? I recently changed to a Kuma oil stove, love it!
2791 2018-11-26 20:06:59 Why doesn't Justin tell them to do what others have in the past ...move to oil jobs in Alberta?  Wait!  There are none there.  Notley and Trudeau made sure of that.
2792 2018-11-26 20:06:58  no gif 
2793 2018-11-26 20:06:56 beer and oil. 1000% cant go wrong with that 
2794 2018-11-26 20:06:55 Oil companies can use their own damn money to destroy the Great Lakes!  It would be great if politicians worked for the people and not their corporate overlords.
2795 2018-11-26 20:06:54 Thank you Nicolette!  #SBS

2798 2018-11-26 20:06:51 Not sure if you have ever done a mega project before it takes many years to get Thru red tape.  Just got regulatory approval on a non oil project took 5 years.  Northern gateway and energy east had govt approval and liberals killed them both.
2799 2018-11-26 20:06:49 Ok I need an oil change
2800 2018-11-26 20:06:47 Thank you!!
2801 2018-11-26 20:06:45 Cute that the Saudis helped lower oil prices after you affirm your support for the lying murderer MBS. Did you leave that part out on purpose?
2802 2018-11-26 20:06:42 How many different available zone looks will this have, like Oil Ocean, Sandopolis and Titanic Monarch?
2803 2018-11-26 20:06:42 Saying that a giant oil field is not secret is not an attempt to convince Scots of anything. Indeed, I've no desire to convince anybody of anything. Our job is to provide reality checks. The field isn't secret. Is that really so hard a concept to grasp? Don't answer, I'm muting.
2804 2018-11-26 20:06:42 Hey Sister Banana Cake;Mash Very Ripe Bananas In a Bowel to pulp add You spices vanilla extract Ginger powder & 2tb Spoon peanut oil 4 oz Rice flour Mixed & allow To Marinate Then Add The Mixture In baking tin line grs proof paper 180 oven 1hr,
2805 2018-11-26 20:06:41 Congratulations all 
2806 2018-11-26 20:06:27 Finding oil would mean that life once existed on Mars.
2807 2018-11-26 20:06:25 Can someone please explain to me y trump is saying America is doing well in the environment when he just allowed mass hunting(poaching and murder) of wild life on public land and mew oil plants. So wheres the clean air and water from?
2808 2018-11-26 20:06:25 My favorite it the pumpkin oil....love love love

• تعويضات الأمطار لن تشمل التسرب أو توقف المضخات 

• “تطاير الحصى ليس أولوية حالياً... والمنازل المتضررة الأهم”
2811 2018-11-26 20:05:55 Not really sure you can take more money from the oil and gas lobby than anyone in Congress besides Ted Cruz and call yourself a progressive...
2812 2018-11-26 20:05:45 محكمة الاستئناف «تلزم» وزارة الأشغال بتعويض مواطن 6500 دينار عن اتلاف سيارته بعد سقوط الأمطار عليها وتحميل الوزارة مسؤولية صيانة المناهيل.
2813 2018-11-26 20:05:39 I would've changed your oil for some chikfila
2814 2018-11-26 20:05:39 ha coming from a supporter whose clubs oil and gas money bought their success 
2815 2018-11-26 20:05:37 Oil would be a sign a past complex life (plants, micro-organisms). Would be pretty cool IMHO.

#MarsWinterClassic2030
2816 2018-11-26 20:05:36 Thank you Sam!!! I'm literally lost for words, which makes a change!

2819 2018-11-26 20:05:18 In September prices was 80 dollar per barrel and we saw previous govt prices when barrel was 40 dollar and price 70 to 80.much difference in oil prices..next month it will reduce. I was working in oil industry and this time oil industry in its worst condition due to abbasi xpm
2820 2018-11-26 20:05:16 Dear me! And they can't borrow to set-up their own anaerobic digestion centre & bio-deisel reactor using old cooking oil & organic waste. Waste is treasure, it produces @adbioresources, electricity, gas, bio-fertiliser & vehicle fuel. It's income generation that reduces costs.
2821 2018-11-26 20:05:11 Marijuana oil is better for your car tho
2822 2018-11-26 20:05:09 Congratulations to all new winners, @the_oil_hut @NibblenOften @snappguides @AdventureCrtrs @ChiChiCardsUK @regiftwrap please join us Tuesdays 8.30 - 9.30pm for #sbswinnershour
2823 2018-11-26 20:05:07 It's not just about the oil prices. It's about everything, everything what this president's doing. That's why the #YellowVests #GiletsJaunes fights against and by the way, your pictures... with blood... are false. It's not the right year or right place
2824 2018-11-26 20:05:03 Thank you soooooooooooo much!!! So glad to join you all! #SBS
2825 2018-11-26 20:05:00 US oil futures post best one-day performance in eight weeks, up over 2% on speculation that OPEC may agree to cut production early next month

2829 2018-11-26 20:04:41 At the mechanic, waiting while they do an oil change
2830 2018-11-26 20:04:41 imagine living in the dark ages and having to spend 3 years painting a coochie on oil & canvas just to jack off
2831 2018-11-26 20:04:39 What are you talkin about intervene stop you mentality of a slave holders worried about you on country leave Venezuela alone why you guys want free oil stop the sabotage to Venezuela's economy
2832 2018-11-26 20:04:38 I'd rather they find oil than life.

If they find life were gonna have to blow it all the smithereens with Space Force.
2833 2018-11-26 20:04:35 If they find oil, how are we going to get our entire military to Mars?
2834 2018-11-26 20:04:28 @NASA will find oil on Mars... you saw it here first
2835 2018-11-26 20:04:21 Well Done everyone. Congratulations on your #SBS win.
2836 2018-11-26 20:04:20 1 minute of driving my car to work and it says I need an oil change and to check my tire pressure back to back

I almost crashed I was so overwhelmed
2837 2018-11-26 20:04:17 A huge well done to you all Xx 
I will try again next week 
2838 2018-11-26 20:04:17 @TheoPaphitis - the 6 #SBS winners are @ChiChiCardsUK, @regiftwrap, @AdventureCrtrs, @snappguides, @NibblenOften & @The_Oil_Hut - well done
2839 2018-11-26 20:04:09 Thank you Anita and many congrats to the other #SBS winners! 
2840 2018-11-26 20:04:05 I love mine with olive oil, lemon juice, and parmesan. I eat a bag at a time.
2841 2018-11-26 20:04:05 Instead he’s gonna focus on destroying $gm as he did with oil
2842 2018-11-26 20:04:02 BBC reported that a former President of Nigeria was involved in the $6bn case of oil fraud being tried in an Italian court.

The former President is Goodluck Ebele 'Nnamdi' Jonathan. 

I don't have time for pretence.

2843 2018-11-26 20:03:59 plus the hemp oil in weed cures cancer.
2844 2018-11-26 20:03:53 Do you usually wear oil on night out drinking as well? I mean I do it really gets the girls goin...
2845 2018-11-26 20:03:47 OMG that's literally flawed me!! I'm absolutely thrilled!! Thank you so much, flattered beyond all belief!! #SBS
2846 2018-11-26 20:03:42 Congratulations to you all... I will try again next week and keep on trying... until I succeed 
2847 2018-11-26 20:03:40 Ottawa is basically running the oil and gas industry now by restricting their ability to get  product to market.
2848 2018-11-26 20:03:28 Tv commercials some lying mfs not even real syrup they’re pouring, it’s motor oil
2849 2018-11-26 20:03:24 Rick takes from oil companies so he has no leg to stand on
2850 2018-11-26 20:03:12 The PCs bet on oil being $150-$200/ bbl for the next six decades when predicting the business case that made Muskrat Falls the best cost option. When comparing such matters you best not forget little tidbits like that. Noting can or will ever compare to what they did.
2851 2018-11-26 20:03:11 Seem like I saw one of these the other day on a pump jack on a oil well in eastern Oklahoma. Or one like it.  O_G
2852 2018-11-26 20:03:10 Congratulations to @The_Oil_Hut on being RTd by @TheoPaphitis for #SBS - have a great week
2853 2018-11-26 20:03:04 Oil changes are always a good time 
2854 2018-11-26 20:03:03 Wanna know what’s more interesting? Nigeria was predicted to be among the richest nations by 2014 because of oil as at 2004/2005. But in 2018 Nigeria is among the poorest and predicted to be lower in 5 years since data is now the most expensive commodity.
2855 2018-11-26 20:02:59 If you go topical though that’ll probably be your best bet though I’ve personally never used it, I’ve taken oil and pills before
2856 2018-11-26 20:02:58 This is short-sighted, IMO. All it will take is a spike in the price of oil to send Americans back to economical cars, and then the Japanese and Korean companies will clean up.

Sad to say, short-sightedness is common at US car companies.
2857 2018-11-26 20:02:53 Palm oil? Rather weak link but it's in lots of mince pies and would be great to illustrate why it's used and what could be used instead?
2858 2018-11-26 20:02:53 The real revenue generating power rests at WM. Scottish oil production is greater than Norway’s but the UK generates less revenue than Norway .....something doesn’t add up with this by the way...
2859 2018-11-26 20:02:46 So let me try & understand this: When tankers come from overseas to supply eastern Canada with oil transported in TANKERS, there is no concern for oil spills, but when Canadian oil is to b transported by tankers, all hell will break loose?  Is that now how we r supposed to think?
2860 2018-11-26 20:02:45 Oil transport is overseen by Transport Canada, a federal agency.

Yet again you show your gross ignorance!

I can see how someone as ignorant & closed minded as you could be fooled by @fordnation & @stanchompp dishonesty.

Sucker
2861 2018-11-26 20:02:44 "There's a SUCKER born every minute!"; "A FOOL & his MONEY are soon parted!" ... All the usual platitudes apply to Hollywood celebs who believe every word from the mouth of the confidence man selling Snake Oil. ~ 'SELLING ETERNAL YOUTH' is the best bet in town to get RICH QUICK.
2862 2018-11-26 20:02:39 Congratulations all, welcome to the #SBS family
So pleased for you Emily @ChiChiCardsUK
2863 2018-11-26 20:02:35 Sometimes I really wish I did art at uni.
I completely adore the expression that is generated through this art.
Jealous! Love to see this challenging work.
Palm oil plantations next?
2864 2018-11-26 20:02:29 Hey-  id treat my old boss that way too.  Sometimes personalities are like oil and water and no matter how hard you try they won’t mix.  I think Baker is the better half of the two so I think #Browns are good
2865 2018-11-26 20:02:25 (ig. @ cloudyy.threadss)
-wash you hands first
-wash with warm water
-apply a very light layer of coconut oil to your lips
-add a sugar scrub (use my natural lip scrub recipes thread)
-leave for 10 mins
-wash off with cold water
2866 2018-11-26 20:02:19 Only marginal 8-9%, I am not able to locate my old data, which I have posted in one discussion, it is from Indian oil site it seems, Google 2014 prices.
2867 2018-11-26 20:02:16 ??? She said it would, only a few hours ago. Treasury needs to burn some midnight oil.
2868 2018-11-26 20:02:09 Oil is thicker abeg 
2869 2018-11-26 20:02:02 Thatcher sold the oil rights off at rock bottom prices.
2870 2018-11-26 20:01:54 This was a dab reference and I smoke dab/oil, blunts, joints, bowls, bongs, etc.
2871 2018-11-26 20:01:44 Product Managers are impervious to the sound of a squeaky wheel.

Zero oil given.
2872 2018-11-26 20:01:43 Congrats all, welcome to the team ! #sbs
2873 2018-11-26 20:01:42 For those curious... 

A fire breathing dragon flew into my churros and breathed fire into the oil, it then burst into flames and all up the side of the churros was on fire. 

Part 1
2874 2018-11-26 20:01:41 Can’t even get an oil change without being hit on 
2875 2018-11-26 20:01:38 Let's think on this a bit. Long enough. Trudeau(McKenna) is killing our best hope for economic sustenance(oil); he's killing our disarmed forces(Sajjan); he's killing our competitiveness (Morneau/Freeland); he's killing our family unit(UN); he's killing Canada for faux diversity.
2876 2018-11-26 20:01:35 Don’t find oil. Don’t find oil.
2877 2018-11-26 20:01:31 #cdnpoli GM closure is a wake up call. The internal combustion engine as we know it is on life support. The oil patch needs to catch up to that reality. We all do.
2878 2018-11-26 20:01:29 Let’s change my oil this week and I’ll buy you some grub
2879 2018-11-26 20:01:20 Guess I’ll keep looking while i wait for my oil change....
2880 2018-11-26 20:01:19 Its corny cuz u see one video and now every dark substance is motor oil 
2881 2018-11-26 20:01:11 I want a sublingual oil type.
2882 2018-11-26 20:01:05 Also topsides for Claire Ridge were under construction during the referendum.
PS, you named after an oil field?
2883 2018-11-26 20:01:04 “Yep I change my oil every 3,000 miles or whenever I get bored, whichever comes first”
2884 2018-11-26 20:01:02 I love you guys but you all sound like Al Gore did in ‘06 when he stated that in 10 years there would be no ice at poles, the earth would be past the point of no return with increased hurricanes, rising sea levels, global warming & we were running out of Nat Gas & Oil.
2885 2018-11-26 20:00:58 It took .5mg of Xanax, a massive dab, an essential oil blend made specifically for sleep, and some herbal sleepy time tea BUT DAMNIT I GOT A GOOD SLEEP. FINALLY.
2886 2018-11-26 20:00:57 Весь укр.твиттер:
— Фуууу, Порошенко ввёл военное положение, чтобы его не переизбрали. Спохватился в последний момент, пидрила, тупой отморозок, власти захотел.

А? Ничего? Что? Военное? Положение? Заканчивается? До? Выборов? И? Выборы? Всё? Равно? Будут?

2892 2018-11-26 20:00:16 Plantation mentality, bought out by big oil years ago. He just needs to come out of the closet & seek the happiness that his momma obviously denied him growing up.
2893 2018-11-26 20:00:13 A hearty fuck you to the oil lobbyist in my inbox claiming that, actually, only the fossil fuel industry is thinking of poor people
2894 2018-11-26 20:00:05 Good time to bail.....markets are up because corporations are leaving Canada, dollar is down.....no future for oil and gas industry as you see it and apparently no future for the auto industry....go away and preach the environment and gender issues.
2895 2018-11-26 20:00:04 Time for wall street baby
Its Darren Banks aka tycoon mogul 
Real estate media sports fashion diamonds gas oil steal technology
2896 2018-11-26 19:59:59 It’s a crucial area for Ukraine. It contains they’re warm water ports and has oil and gas reserves
2897 2018-11-26 19:59:52 Replacing the buggy with cars was a natural process which took many decades to evolve. The demand for oil will increase for the next 25 yrs and even then oil will still be used in abundance. So, yes, Canada can use,explore and export its oil while being involved in new tech too!!
2898 2018-11-26 19:59:50 Unombokanganwa kuti c/oil irikudhura home boy
2899 2018-11-26 19:59:49 This is the most annoying, espically when you work with rocks in oil. Absolutely fuck all oil related on the clyde/west coast.
2900 2018-11-26 19:59:43 What do think we should do to Edomite British Govt  for the Continuous GENOCIDE of Hebrew Biafra to steal oil and gas?.....SILENCE!. We are not fighting Globalist wars anymore.
2901 2018-11-26 19:59:42 Well done to this week's #SBS winners @The_Oil_Hut @NibblenOften @snappguides @AdventureCrtrs @regiftwrap & @ChiChiCardsUK - welcome with RT !
2902 2018-11-26 19:59:41 As long as America’s politicians and their campaigns receive monies form big corporations -  ie. GOP Receiving $$$ from big oil. GOP will continue to deny and look the other way with regards to the science behind the increase in global catastrophic weather events.

It’s fact.
2903 2018-11-26 19:59:24 if u wanna know which kid is my mum's favourite, simply take a look at the *oil painting* my mum just completed of our dog x
2904 2018-11-26 19:59:17 Congrats to NASA on landing the Mars probe. I hope America learns the lesson of Iraq and actually takes the oil this time.
2905 2018-11-26 19:59:12 We need to ban fracking and reduce fossil fuel extraction in California, the third highest oil producing state in the country.

Do you support a ban on fracking?
2906 2018-11-26 19:59:07 SOPHIE'S 'OIL OF EVERY PEARL'S UN-INSIDE' was the best album of 2018
2907 2018-11-26 19:59:05 Canadians, wake the f**k up! 

Oil and gas companies rip product from the ground, with $$$billionsin subsidies through taxes and then leave more $$$ billions in clean up costs for our children and grandchildren and you keep putting Parties in power that continue these practices!
2908 2018-11-26 19:59:00 You have the gull to tweet this bs out after GM just announced closing and what's going on with our oil industry #ScrewUTrudeau
2909 2018-11-26 19:58:53 Clove oil, or ask your PCP or dentist for a Rx of Lidocaine. Explain your situation & they may do this for you.
2910 2018-11-26 19:58:50 May God help that planet if they find oil
2911 2018-11-26 19:58:48 The answer to the plant closure in Oshawa is simple, start building our own cars and trucks, develop our gas and oil sector to use Canadian petroleum and tell the workers you cannot expect to make 30 or 40 dollars an hour to put nuts.
2912 2018-11-26 19:58:41 Not to mention closet homosexual, total hypocrite who's been on big oil's payroll for years.
2913 2018-11-26 19:58:40 ....Nigeria loss oil rich Bakassi..
No wonder you support @MBuhari
2914 2018-11-26 19:58:38 @BradWall306    Why can’t we refine more oil, Refineries are expensive but we need more products. No way we should be paying this price for gas.. what about pegging our dollar the same as USA
2915 2018-11-26 19:58:32 Just bought those books off of Amazon for my 7 year old daughter for Christmas  @wick_22
2916 2018-11-26 19:58:32 Venezuela has endemic corruption re it’s oil industry and America has it in the grip of draconian sanctions Scottish economy structurally much stronger than Greece ..and the Gers figures have been demonstrated to be manipulated re Scottish exports and contribution to UK GDP
2917 2018-11-26 19:58:31 Thats where the magical BCAA drink comes in to remedy the muscle pain for you. that or some good CBD oil.
2918 2018-11-26 19:58:31 Guess he has that duck oil gland.
2919 2018-11-26 19:58:11 Truly some people MUMU never still do....atiku is the owner of generator company and oil and gas company,,, this is another dankness you want to enter... @wearetakingbacknigerian   TAKEITBACK AAC TAKEITBACK  sowore for president TAKEITBACK movement TAKEITBACK AAC TAKEITBACK
2920 2018-11-26 19:58:06 Take some oil
2921 2018-11-26 19:58:01  I’m amazed my exhaust and oil pan are still there tbh
2922 2018-11-26 19:58:00 Oil......it made me cry
2923 2018-11-26 19:57:59 $MGON Hearing big news coming! MMJ + Canada Recreational + Olive Oil = HUGE CONTRACTS
2924 2018-11-26 19:57:44 Every time a new idea for something better will compete with something which exists, there are people who think of 100 reasons not to build it. Buggy builders didn't want cars. Oil lamp makers said that electric lights were too dangerous.  No corporations make either now.
2925 2018-11-26 19:57:42 man the oil industry is really spoiling alberta's natural splendor in a big way
2926 2018-11-26 19:57:37 I love robotic oil poffins~!
2927 2018-11-26 19:57:17 I'm really impressed by this breakthrough, congratulations to all that have contributed immensely to this success. #MarsLanding
2928 2018-11-26 19:57:10 So did we find oil yet? #MarsLanding
2929 2018-11-26 19:56:53 oil derrick
2930 2018-11-26 19:56:45 my rosehip oil finally got here IT'S BEEN STRAIGHT HELL LIVING W OUT IT!!! MY SKIN GETS TO LIVEEEE
2931 2018-11-26 19:56:37 Trudeau does not want the auto industry or oil. Trudeau wants everyone on a skateboard.
2932 2018-11-26 19:56:30 So women and children didn't have tear gas fired at them ? And murder's not okay as long as you keep the oil down and buy your apartments and rent your hotel rooms? Thank God for that, I thought the US had become a tinpot dictatorship for moment.
2933 2018-11-26 19:56:25 He's controlled by the Russians AND the Saudis.

But he's somehow got the EU buying OUR oil.

Everybody move down, I need a clean cup.
2934 2018-11-26 19:56:17 Let me put my baby oil on, it’s about to be a fight and I have chosen a side
2935 2018-11-26 19:56:14 Really not. That's exactly what the science says. And yes, the task seems impossible. But what else is there? Decide it's a global hoax perpetrated by Al Gore and the UN and some tiny cadre of mostly retired scientists funded by oil companies have it right?
2936 2018-11-26 19:55:52 “Your values” coming from any American makes me snort in disgust. You are either hun totting at home (killing each other’s kids)or abroad (to protect some arms deal or oil money) or you are banging on about God whilst remaining utterly shameless
2937 2018-11-26 19:55:47 Как бы... Военное положение... заканчивается до... выборов...

2941 2018-11-26 19:55:23 My EU acquaintances voted for Brexit one & all. The U.K. suffered extensively allowing OPEC to force migrants in as Oil Company Mgmt. Enough came in to elect a London mayor from Iran. MI6 let the Queen down big time. Premier Leage sounds like introducing two Pakistani HS teams.
2942 2018-11-26 19:55:10 Twitter is really out here ruining food photos for me

2943 2018-11-26 19:55:09 cacay oil
2944 2018-11-26 19:55:06 Shame does have its uses! It's a powerful emotion. But with children, we don't want to unleash these things. Still, with folks like the man who murdered his wife & daughters & hid their bodies in oil, you start to see that, for these guys, punishment doesn't have an effect.
2945 2018-11-26 19:55:04 oil cacay
2946 2018-11-26 19:55:01 Snake oil outfits must see the police coming. Some boss gushes over it as the best thing since sliced bread & fabulous promotion board evidence. The force struggles with an absolute crock until the thing dies an ignominious death & its patrons creep on to the next 'project'.
2947 2018-11-26 19:54:56 No oil onboard these empty w-tankers.
2948 2018-11-26 19:54:46 He’s a phony, backstabbing snake oil salesmen. Bakers just calling him on it.
2949 2018-11-26 19:54:44 It is just amazing. They are providing you 100% pure oil refining and that too within a short span of time! I just loved it and I do recommend to others.
2950 2018-11-26 19:54:42 don't use oil rad to dry
2951 2018-11-26 19:54:41 So glad to hear that. Have you tried using cannabis oil to treat the seizures? They use it here in North America with fantastic results
2952 2018-11-26 19:54:40 Thanks- it is bad. Even if I don't eat soy directly, I can still get reactions from transfers, or the oils they use to cook in. Soybean oil is commonly used to dry or cook with there- and that's hard to exclude.
2953 2018-11-26 19:54:14 Republicans don’t think addressing climate change will be too costly to our economy. They think it will be too costly to their pocket books. Once big oil got carte Blanche from SCOTUS to go all in buying off the GOP  all the sudden became climate deniers. Not hard to follow.
2954 2018-11-26 19:54:13 We will have no problem getting accepted we have a lot to offer them were not the underdog the English like to portray . You forgot we've got all the oil.
2955 2018-11-26 19:54:13 I understand that oil demand is going to rise, but that doesn’t mean we have to destroy our water supplies and natural habitats continually. We need to wean the oil production down, and building many more pipelines won’t help that
2956 2018-11-26 19:54:10 take the oil!
2957 2018-11-26 19:54:08 Oil jobs - leaving 
Manufacturing jobs - leaving
Unskilled immigrants - coming 

Where will they work as immigrants filled the manufacturing jobs 30-40yrs ago.

Canada is not creating enough full time jobs to accept 400K immigrants/yr.

It will become a welfare state.
2958 2018-11-26 19:53:53 Fr tho @Suavecitopomade makes some of the best products for men. I use their bread oil, and hair product. Gotta look good for the bitches, of both sexes.
2959 2018-11-26 19:53:50 Spray my scalp with acv. Slightly diluted. Tea tree oil.

Soaking the hair in an acv solution before braiding makes a difference too.
2960 2018-11-26 19:53:45 He raised a lot of working people’s money, while also taking millions from oil lobbyists.
2961 2018-11-26 19:53:45 That was an honest question. I do all cooking in either olive or coconut oil.
2962 2018-11-26 19:53:44 i need an ACV rinse &a hot oil treatment asap.
2963 2018-11-26 19:53:40 Fact:

GOP is funded by big oil and gas. Any regulations placed on big oil to help the air we breath and to help thwart the catastrophic weather events that are killing people in our country and around the world - will result in GOP losing all that money that big oil gives them.
2964 2018-11-26 19:53:24 I'm still dead about the motor oil thing.
2965 2018-11-26 19:53:10 Yeah U.S.A, FDA and nutrient guides don’t always pull their 100% like they’re paid to do, gloss over stuffaroonies, and end up having things like beef oil cooked fries advertised at McDonalds, it’s a mess and all kinds of hecced up.
2966 2018-11-26 19:53:09 Let them blow the hell out of each other and afterwards Trump can do what he has already said we should do. Go in and take (steal) all of there oil.  Who cares what happens to Muslims let them kill each other.  That's want you seem to be saying.   Page 2
2967 2018-11-26 19:53:05 with what stop are cheap oil lol..
2968 2018-11-26 19:53:01 Yeah bet he doesn't stand up to people with oil money killing people.
2969 2018-11-26 19:52:58 When I studied environmental issues in 1982 coal gas and oil were going to run out within 30 years.  Science works by theory being able to be demonstrated to be false.  We should be equally sceptical about all theory not just accept.
2970 2018-11-26 19:52:43 For the most part they fight for oil, corporate interests and to maintain their extreme form of capitalism. None of that is really for the people or country, you’re just led to believe that.
2971 2018-11-26 19:52:38 the o years were sooooo corrupt and just let slide thru because he was the first “black” man that was a smooth talking snake oil salesman that nobody wanted to question because they would be called a racist and labeled as such that would ruin their career for good.  libs & SNL !!
2972 2018-11-26 19:52:36 Rusty called into the @RoadDogTrucking radio show asking about the definition of a steering box oil leak. Here's the answer from CVSA Operational Policy 15: A violation should not be written until the seepage or leak is great enough to form drops and drip during an inspection.
2973 2018-11-26 19:52:29 No one has faith in oil price. Maybe just what we need.

2975 2018-11-26 19:52:21 STOP THE DAMN LYING you let the Prince of Saudi Arabia hire someone to brutally kill a United States citizen which was a journalist for the Washington post so enough with the BS stories you should be guilty as well for worrying about their oil instead of the Prince getting away
2976 2018-11-26 19:52:13 My subjective vision loss is getting better. I believe it's the CBD oil. So called subjective loss has a test that proves it's neurological. This is what I get. They wonder why we are on the defense!

2983 2018-11-26 19:51:28 89 cents / litre for kerosene at the weekend and the barrel of oil after falling 30% in the last three weeks. 
There's a lot of price gouging going on.....

2984 2018-11-26 19:51:20 Ok thanks for that . But one genuine question if you don't mind.
Did Scotland or WM sell off the rights to the oil and if WM doesn't/wouldn't that make a difference if Scotland chose independence ?
2985 2018-11-26 19:51:11 Greece is similar as it had a high reliance on state assistancewith a low tax base, Venezuela had more oil than us and promised a utopia that could not be delivered.
If you are going to dismiss other points because they are inconvenient, you will lose the next one same as last.
2986 2018-11-26 19:51:10 Oil money? 
2987 2018-11-26 19:51:03 So 98% of climate scientists get paid to side with climate change?  Who’s paying them??  Who’s richer than the oil industry, who’s paying the other 2%???
2988 2018-11-26 19:50:57 Can’t ppl make it an issue???? Doesn’t anybody care???? This is our grt country!!! Create the pipeline!! We need oil!!! We need jobs!!!
2989 2018-11-26 19:50:54 44% of our oil currently comes from Canada. Only 11% comes from Saudi Arabia. For some reason, the US pipelines and fracking don’t seem viable. I don’t know why but agree we need to be less dependent on foreign oil.

2992 2018-11-26 19:50:37 the best oil is the cacay oil
2993 2018-11-26 19:50:36 Look in the mirror? To see what? The people who work in Oil and gas are not the ones banning pipelines and protesting to keep the natural resources in the ground. Other forces are in play against Big Oil. Why isn’t Nenshi fighting for the Oil and gas industry?
2994 2018-11-26 19:50:25 At what point do they lose money one their oil and gas? We are pretty close to that now, I believe. They aren't exactly awash in cash.
2995 2018-11-26 19:50:18 Only if they have an abundance of oil then it's ok
2996 2018-11-26 19:50:15 The WH Admin and the GOP have done everything they can to bleed out the ACA. My question is where is the "Replace" of "Repeal & Replace?" Who has been putting pen to paper and been working on that? Which GOP Congressman are burning the midnight oil? Names? Where's the "Replace?"
2997 2018-11-26 19:50:15 Oil is very common but expensive and damaging to the environment to dig up which is why we like the oil fields and oil reserves over in the middle east, singular operations generate 100x as much as one would over in America
2998 2018-11-26 19:50:01 Don’t worry, billions will go to them for compensation. Oil patch gets the platitudes.

3000 2018-11-26 19:49:55 On the ten year Anniversary of the Mumbo-Jumbo attacks, the US stands with the Indians except those who tried to stop my tremendous oil Pipelines at Standing Rock.  They are total losers.
3001 2018-11-26 19:49:42 I've heard the term 'blood for oil' before, but the relationship has never been this direct. Buying this cheap gas is somehow being an accessory after the fact to the murder of Jamal Khashoggi.

3005 2018-11-26 19:49:27 FEEL YOU ON THIS LIFE. Try replacing it with CBD oil and vaping. I feel much better about myself these days.
3006 2018-11-26 19:49:23 Legislate domestic oil over foreign oil. Rail it around. No pipelines. Create a national oil price. As for GM, that’s corporate greed. Hope the concessions you made in USMCA was worth it. @justintrudeau #cdnpoli #NoPipelines
3007 2018-11-26 19:49:19 I was walking through topshop to get to Boots to get some palmers oil...and ended up buying some boots and a bag. Natch. Then I went to Boots and bought the new Chanel Mademoiselle launched in September and forgot the oil.
3008 2018-11-26 19:49:19 Also, for full transparency Chuck, maybe disclose the donor & lobby interests that support the organization a given pundit works for. Eg. Danielle works for AEI which is funded by Koch Industries & other oil/gas related corps & lobbies. She’s not a scientist but...

3012 2018-11-26 19:48:58 Lol I was the opposite liked the oil, but not the malt, still haven't got a sweet tooth to this day. Must have been a weird kid only liked the fat off the meat,  and the white off eggs.. 
3013 2018-11-26 19:48:58 Make homemade candy (caramels, etc) and make up gift bags
Or buy unusual high-end food products: olive oil from Bethlehem, cheese basket made by nuns, or special herb-infused vinegar, for example
3014 2018-11-26 19:48:57 I had to na. 

In fact, N100 oil too much, N50 oil palm, N50 offor (thickener).

3018 2018-11-26 19:48:33 There are a couple of solutions for Venezuela. One is simply for oh say 150 million Americans to storm Venezuela's borders, take up residence there, vote out Maduro and his gang and establish the New America, and use their oil to make ourselves rich. Call it payback.
3019 2018-11-26 19:48:29 I was given a beautiful rosary bead with holy oil on the cross from a good friend from Jerusalem where he is born. Means a lot to me 
3020 2018-11-26 19:48:28 And all your solutions are wrong: stop nuclear power! We get fossil fuel nightmare. Give people more welfare! Dependency and ghettos and drug addiction. Find People work! Not if it's oil sands or sells to China. Gender equality now! Except for hetero white men. Memes
3021 2018-11-26 19:48:26 Yes. Just how it lies about coconut oil  if you like something thick (which I do LOLOL) I use this thick ass vitamin e cream it feels like Vaseline but it actually moisturizes and helps your skin

3027 2018-11-26 19:47:37 (E) Alberta oil & gas is one of the main economic drivers in the country. He needs to champion this message, and constantly remind Canadians how many dollars (around 100M a day) in NATIONAL wealth is created by the Energy Sector.

3044 2018-11-26 19:46:01 Yes, our fuel sources have been superceded by dirty Saudi oil sources. That doesn't mean it's outmoded. It means the source of supply has changed. Use has not decreased one iota. It is not outmoded. Just look out your window. People are not giving up their cars.

3050 2018-11-26 19:45:52 Given that the existence of a legitimately conspiratorial governmental strategy to withhold information re oil revenues prior to another referendum is on public record, is it the modern journalist’s obligation to investigate suspicions or ridicule the suspicious?

Sadly, it would also bypass BC from the benefits, but he wouldn't see a fight from Horgan on it. (D) Champion our oil and gas as the most environmental and ethical in the world.

3066 2018-11-26 19:44:20 Well that would be a good ideal but at the present time we have no real back up replacement for either coal or oil the solar & wind generating capabilities are not up to the task more research needs more work we know about this since 1970's but have ignored it for 50yrs

3070 2018-11-26 19:43:50 I've decided to indulge in home made smoothies this summer. Fresh fruit and produce bought locally. And I'm reading plenty of labels. The WW ice cream I bought the other day doesn't contain palm oil.
3071 2018-11-26 19:43:45 Falling oil prices will not hurt Industrial Production?
3072 2018-11-26 19:43:41 I’d quite agree with all of that as palm oil unfortunately is a largish part of my sons diet but buying sustainable is the way forward

3077 2018-11-26 19:43:30 I feel bad for the folks losing jobs in Oshawa this morning. However, I have no doubt that at least 2500 Albertans have lost jobs due to the oil crisis caused by lack of pipelines. Will @JustinTrudeau and the Feds do "everything possible " to help them back onto their feet too??

3084 2018-11-26 19:43:11 It’s such a canard to say that scientists have an agenda. It’s ridiculous.

These are people who have dedicated their lives to facts. Truth.

Now let’s see who has an agenda, denying climate science. Big oil and big gas, contributors to the problem. 

A real brain tickler.

3122 2018-11-26 19:40:12 Denial vs science, dem vs rep are distractions. The battle to the death is between oil companies vs everyone and everything else. And oil companies are winning. Just put one oil company out of business. And the slippery slope takes care of the rest of our problems automatically.

3128 2018-11-26 19:39:56 Republicans don't admit anything because they want it all and don't care. It's money. They want all the trees, all the oil, all the gas, all the coal, all the fish. When it's all wasted and used up they'll say it's not their fault.
3129 2018-11-26 19:39:55 Incidentals are actually not illegal. If you're not selling the syrup, it's legal to use motor oil in its place.

3161 2018-11-26 19:36:57 Oil companies have always been dishonest. When there has been big break throughs of alternative fuels these people that found it disappear. Like the mystery deaths that surround the Clintons all 200+ And never any investigation into it there covered up by the government.

3164 2018-11-26 19:36:51 Great news if all of Alberta held a referendum to see just how many would get on the wagon 200 hundred year's  of oil and we are on the starvation list like Venezuela Alberta should not take this setting down up standing up to get Canada on its feet some one should figure it out
3165 2018-11-26 19:36:44 You’re an idiot
3166 2018-11-26 19:36:41 too much oily,it could be fried in nonstick with few drops of oil or butter and taste would be more delicious

3170 2018-11-26 19:36:23 Nigeria still has about 30 years to catch up to the rest of the world. If we are still depending on oil by then, we're fucked.

3174 2018-11-26 19:36:11 @Dan_Dicker Wow thanks for getting back at me. Hope u had a good Thanksgiving. Would u still hold dividend-paying Big Oil for the long-term tho? Know that last question however may be a bridge too far here on Twitter.
3175 2018-11-26 19:36:01 @kudzie_sharara@scott_mac_zw of course there is oil 
Further exploration is need to accurately quantify and assert the resources in question
3176 2018-11-26 19:35:58 I would love to see Rex debate Elizabeth May or Trudeau over the importance of the CDN oil sector to the CDN economy.
3177 2018-11-26 19:35:58 Ok so they refine the oil in Alberta then what?
3178 2018-11-26 19:35:57 Those dirty scientists, all willing to lie and deceive us for the millions of dollars in climate research. Thank God we have the honest, caring oil industry which is providing so much oil out of the goodness of their hearts with no care for money or profits.
3179 2018-11-26 19:35:48 What does "T" have to do with oil prices...or the price of tea in China for that matter? I'm just not tracking what he's getting at.
3180 2018-11-26 19:35:46 Every time u get a oil change the mechanic tell u $1000 worth of shit wrong like u finna pay to get fixed on spot like my nigga don’t u see me buying the standard oil change 
3181 2018-11-26 19:35:45 Don't forget to include a middle class tax cut in your platform. And notice the globe has been warming since the last ice age a natural normal process. Doesn't mean we shouldn't limit the use of fossil fuels. We don't need gas lines when there's plenty of oil to drill.

3188 2018-11-26 19:35:11 I was actually wondering if TMX could give Trudeau his "just watch me" moment, and flex some muscle in the matter. Barring that, here is my list of things that his government could do to move oil to market. (1) Remove the draconian conditions placed on Energy East & encourage (1)

3192 2018-11-26 19:34:42 1. Why is Santorum commenting on climate change at all? He doesn’t know the scientist, he’s just a delivery device for oil and coal industry talking points.
2. Why doesn’t anyone have Santorum in at all? He doesn’t have an original thought in his head.

3194 2018-11-26 19:34:38 All I want right now is a massive pan of fried dumplings and hot oil to dip them into.
3195 2018-11-26 19:34:30 I’m just so very curious Gary- why are you so interested in denying climate change? Work for an oil company? Russian bot? A scientist producing peer-reviewed findings? Bored? Selfish? What’s your beef man?
3196 2018-11-26 19:34:28 You've not tried eating those yams with the oil used to fry turkey
3197 2018-11-26 19:34:23 Lol it’s the opposite. Oils don’t moisturize. They seal in the moisture that’s already there so the key is a quality moisturizer and then an oil after. Try Shea moisture jbco leave-in conditioner or mane choice leave-in or aunt jackies quench leave in.
3198 2018-11-26 19:34:17 On the plus side, I am booked solid with work up to mid-January, have two new clients (one French, one Dutch), and I had a tax refund from previous years, which paid for the car and some heating oil. #smartnetworking
3199 2018-11-26 19:34:03 although it’s a old one, Ampro black gel is a good one to try! it doesn’t flake, & has protein in it (if you get the right one). bc it tends to be more “clot” like i just mix it w/ a little oil & it works wonderful & i have 4c hair

3201 2018-11-26 19:33:58 I feel like my engine’s been shaking ever since yesterday when my granddaddy said I don’t get my oil changed until the light comes on
3202 2018-11-26 19:33:48 Remind me not to tell you what baby oil is made from. 
3203 2018-11-26 19:33:48 Ah, but the oil companies! And the profits from all those replacement parts for those internal combustion engines.
So many decisions could have been made over the past 100 years that would have us living on a healthier planet today.

3216 2018-11-26 19:32:57 he can say thanks all the same.. if Canada is 40% of USA oil why are you so angry when the Saudi want to raise price would it not make you in a stronger position to have USA cut support because you can give oil much cheaper?
3217 2018-11-26 19:32:54 I agree, its not an objective source but the facts are the facts. Pls respond to the facts. Do you disagree that 4 pipelines were built and the amount of oil they carry? Or do you wanna just play stupid twitter games?
3218 2018-11-26 19:32:45 And the Saudis will just say, ok, publicly slander our Crown Prince and by extension the entire ruling class, which is the massive Saudi royal family, and we'll continue to buy your arms, keep oil prices down and assist you against Iran.
3219 2018-11-26 19:32:44 I need Ben n Jerry’s dairy free ice cream, a massage, & eucalyptus essential oil

3227 2018-11-26 19:32:15 I remember barrels being $45.00 and gas was 55- 60 cents. barrels of cdn oil are under 15? we should be at .25-.30c
3228 2018-11-26 19:32:11 Wasn't the original tweet about Scotland(with its oil)being able to afford independence, about an Indy Scotland without food banks being a wealthy country regardless of size.
Do you mean dissolving the union won't put you on the path to independence. Sorry if I misread your tweet
3229 2018-11-26 19:32:07 You won't, in fact, find me making any partisan pro-unionist remarks or reports, so your point is moot.; But, even if I had, why would that make it OK to amplify false claims or fake news about secret oil fields?

3248 2018-11-26 19:30:11 It painful seriously, no scale of reference.
3249 2018-11-26 19:30:05 The moment when talking with Vignette salt and oil, Steak with whine-thyme sauce and bladder is inflamed, I really feel lonely because I can't talk with my friends..also yesterday was always alone.
3250 2018-11-26 19:29:55 I put a tsp of coconut oil in my bath last night and it helped the rest of my skin... not sure I'd use it on my face, but the itching stopped everywhere else!
3251 2018-11-26 19:29:50 Dude, we did all this before. I pointed out how this doesn't capture it. But, fortunately, a year and a half later, we now can see that oil names have indeed underperformed oil (by a lot, before the latest slide) and ppl are routinely citing the dynamic I described. Case close.
3252 2018-11-26 19:29:43 I mean, we're literally making a revolution (yeah, I know, another one, it's like the 15th in our country) right now because our president si trying to steal our precious oil lmao

#GameChanger
3254 2018-11-26 19:29:40 calling Saudi Arabia " dubious" partner just makes it clear how little you actually know about us Arabia relationship. They have been most favored nation for us arms deals long before Trump came onto the scene. It has to do with a little thing called billions of barrels of oil.
3255 2018-11-26 19:29:31 @AbusidiquBlog this news from Italian Government is Completely fake news why now election is February why releasing the new now, Italian Government is undermining PDP as Opposition. 
I accuses Italian Government for collecting bribe from APC.
What they said about oil is nonsense
3256 2018-11-26 19:29:30 Twists always make my head itch no matter how much I oil my scalp
3257 2018-11-26 19:29:26 Oil prices are falling. Who cares? You need to live in the real world .  Here in Okla., Gas has increased  by $0.47 (21%), per gallon, in just the last year; and, it is still going up, as of Thanksgiving.
3258 2018-11-26 19:29:09 The blame game is over Canadians can’t afford it, start working together we all knew this would happen eventually and did nothing to broaden our trade abilities so we fucked ourselves simple as that  now build that pipeline as fast as possible so we can export the damn oil 
3259 2018-11-26 19:29:03 No thanks - she wasn't a good leader at all, just a bossy old crab with a husband who nobbed up to prince phillip, who had north sea oil revenue to slosh around ....crystal clear this entire thing has been stage managed now isn't it!
3260 2018-11-26 19:28:55 This is a total newsfail @cnn.  Maybe book some actual scientists to talk, instead of a criminal politician who spent his entire career in the pocket of the oil industry. #Newsfail
3261 2018-11-26 19:28:46 they’re playing dreams by fleetwood mac in this oil changing place, legend
3262 2018-11-26 19:28:40 Bout to stop using lotion and just use coconut oil
3263 2018-11-26 19:28:40 So you’re not ok with him but you’re ok to take out the Saudi money& special oil prices!!!!!!! It’s your right to have a free speech for sure , but act like it and take the full responsibility to take a side in a case that was not done & hold in Saudi justices system _
3264 2018-11-26 19:28:39 I always thought the easiest way to integrate renewable energy was to mandate that a certain amount of new construction have renewable energy built into the structure. 

First we will need to convince the GOP that coal isn’t clean and oil won’t last forever.
3265 2018-11-26 19:28:37 Olde moonbeam just threw a party! Barrel of oil up$1.19! Now that’s the way to screw the middle class! 
3266 2018-11-26 19:28:36 Now that our insane “green” energy policies and uncompetitive taxation is costing jobs in #MuhAutoSector, Laurentian Canada will finally pay attention. The many more jobs and billions in gov’t revenue lost in the oil patch didn’t even warrant “meh” from them. #cdnpoli #cdnecon
3267 2018-11-26 19:28:35 Is it soft? I have very delicate skin. Maybe men use a softening oil????
3268 2018-11-26 19:28:33 If it is mars oil you know it the usa will "bring it freedom" (tm)
3269 2018-11-26 19:28:32 why is it shocking? 

the automobile is severely outdated; oil is severely outdated; new generations of Americans don't want to be tied down to an auto and oil

maybe GM shouldn't have ruined our public transportation options when they had the chance to become world leaders
3270 2018-11-26 19:28:28 If you are employed you two will get through this easier. I’m in Houston. Economy has been better, but goes up and down with the price of oil. I also love Dallas. Ya’ll come if you can find what you need here. Check out the price of housing in our suburbs.
3271 2018-11-26 19:28:21 My dad just did his show from an olive oil store owned by Frankie Muniz and his fiancé
3272 2018-11-26 19:28:09 So sorry he feels hurt... I mean come on!

Can't believe @gmbutts would let this minister say this.

The liberal BS is going to get thick very fast.

No personal feelings hurt at decline of oil industry...but those aren't @JerryPDias liberal union votes in Alberta. 
3273 2018-11-26 19:28:07 OPEC meeting Dec 6 in Vienna. Full ministerial able to make decision on production cut. Issue is US pressure on Saudi Arabia to lower oil prices. Meanwhile Novak and al Falih are discussing re agreement for next week
3274 2018-11-26 19:28:06 I eat the shoelaces like spaghetti
3275 2018-11-26 19:28:04 Where’s the oil
3276 2018-11-26 19:27:54 Bill they only want Scotland for our oil and gas the unionist Tory's have run up billions in debt and the other unionists labour want our oil and gas to supply England with money they want to spend do you think they would want Scotland if we had no oil o gas
3277 2018-11-26 19:27:42 Any nigga with the name Leroy in 2018 can definitely change your tires, your oil, and spark plugs with one hand while smoking a cigarette.

3281 2018-11-26 19:27:36 @IainDale wouldn't it be nice for a quiet week,then we might go back to the matter of the Saudis murdering  Kashoggi in Turkey and why all of a sudden oil prices fell,dastardly deeds from the UK and USA

3285 2018-11-26 19:27:13 Nope. Only way that’s going to be solved if we just kill oil production.
3286 2018-11-26 19:27:07 Oooh Angie see if you can follow the dots. Rexxon=Artic drilling deal/Crimea annexation=oil export ports/Ukraine invasion=control of pipelines/Roseneft 19% sold to unknown entities=GOP?/2016 election interference=loosening US sanctions. But sure, let's compare the 2 things.
3287 2018-11-26 19:27:06 Canada can survive Justin Trudeau, Canada can not survive a system where the two biggest provinces (and welfare provinces to the east) impose a Justin Trudeau on the west and stand by while he deliberately and maliciously destroys the oil industry and Alberta economy. #westexit

3289 2018-11-26 19:27:05 Has anybody tried CBD oil for their asthma?
3290 2018-11-26 19:26:59 its “your last oil” not “your car” 
3291 2018-11-26 19:26:51 Type in Beto ORourke oil and gas industry donations
3292 2018-11-26 19:26:47 My 10" sakundiak I bought in 2012 had an oil drain hose.  Very convenient.
3293 2018-11-26 19:26:42 I gave my car oil and it kept it so quiet I completely forgot to shift into top gear...
3294 2018-11-26 19:26:41 Ow ya what about the world wide oil shortage in 1973 tankers were ordered to stay out to sea biggest RIP off of the American people
3295 2018-11-26 19:26:40 A little lemon juice, olive oil, salt, & pepper break it down

3298 2018-11-26 19:26:24 Oil of cloves and 3 Advil green gel warm salt water swishing  
3299 2018-11-26 19:26:19 Well that's a nice (and obvious) observation but no conspiracy there. One is a dictator of a Soviet-integrated Republic and one is the biggest oil supplier in the world. Guess who gets the free pass to do what they want.
3300 2018-11-26 19:26:17 And what pray tell would an insurgency in the USA be over? Terrorists? Religion? Oil? Poppy fields? Minerals?

3302 2018-11-26 19:26:11 Welding fabrication, brakes, exhaust, oil changes. Basic stuff , but the main thing would be fabrication.
3303 2018-11-26 19:26:02 I go back further than you I think Anni, werent any capsules when I was a nipper, had our codliver oil and malt given by mum, oil on a teaspoon from time we could drink from a spoon. My sis and I used to argue who had had the most, We'd got to like it that much.!
3304 2018-11-26 19:25:54 It was basically a REALLY DENSE and REALLY SWEET red velvet cake in a loaf tin, with crumbled red velvet Oreos on top. It hid the weed oil taste really well.
3305 2018-11-26 19:25:49 and hair fall is often due to diet as well. specific hair fall shampoos and conditioners help. i can recommend you an oil that has at least helped my hair fall
3306 2018-11-26 19:25:44 Dude just use anti pigmentation and discoloration cream itna expensive hai bio oil. Rosehip oil and collagen powder
3307 2018-11-26 19:25:43 The thing shock me
3308 2018-11-26 19:25:40  oil prices always drop during the holidays! Watch them go up in January. Who you take for a fool? Ohh wait, idiots like you!
3309 2018-11-26 19:25:30 Also, we know people are making money in the oil industry. But they can't possibly be motivated by money?? Why not?
3310 2018-11-26 19:25:21 Get out the chrism oil.
3311 2018-11-26 19:25:13 Ok idan ka gama
3312 2018-11-26 19:25:09 Found a new perfume oil to mix in my ""fragrance recipe"" that smells exactly like a candle I had in my flat in Gothenburg during a period (one of them) that truly sucked, didn't realise until I got home, now I'm gonna walk around smelling like anxiety 

- a vibe
3313 2018-11-26 19:24:53 Welcome to the new Green Canada #liberals No OIL no need to build Cars  #alberta oil
3314 2018-11-26 19:24:44 Drink some more of the @JustinTrudeau koolaid - the west is losing oil jobs and now the east is losing good manufacturing jobs. Wake up and smell the jobs leaving
3315 2018-11-26 19:24:36 Rahab, saying, Whom therefore a trespass to hell, to the day thou hast done to Jerusalem. And oil upon you.
3316 2018-11-26 19:24:19 Steal life with each breath. To the fullest. Burn out. Both candles. Midnight oil. Yada yada. The key is being enlivened in boredom because that's most of what is between the bookends.
3317 2018-11-26 19:24:14 Now, or for about a week until the soap has absorbed the oil.
3318 2018-11-26 19:24:13 Ok watch Trudeau give help to the GM closure way quicker than he has for oil industry in Alberta. Oh yeah he needs those Ontario votes to stay in power
3319 2018-11-26 19:24:08 Canada produces more oil than it can consume. As a result, Canada is a significant net exporter of crude oil. In 2017, Canada was the largest foreign supplier of crude oil to the U.S., accounting for 43% of total U.S. crude oil imports and for 21% of U.S. refinery crude oil intak
3320 2018-11-26 19:24:08 .@brikeilarcnn Why give a platform to convicted money launderer #TomDeLay? Ask if he's being financed by #FossilFuel industry concerns. An hour of television is a precious commodity to be used to promote the #truth. Hosting shills who promote #oil industry lies is a disgrace @CNN
3321 2018-11-26 19:24:07 hair, skin and body aren't permanent results. It's about maintenance. You can't expect to see results unless you do it repeatedly. I'm assuming if oiling is done 2- 4 times a week, 3 weeks should be good to show results. but depends again on the hair damage and oil type
3322 2018-11-26 19:24:06 In 1910, Gattefosse burned a hand very badly and later claimed he treated it effectively with #Lavender #Oil.
3323 2018-11-26 19:23:49 Jamaican black castor oil, and braids 4-6 weeks depending on type, wash/deep conditioning in between braids, and keeping scalp oiled while the braids are in. Hair is bra strap length now
3324 2018-11-26 19:23:41 They forget he also opened up more oil locations for drilling to keep them prices low. Soon 80% of the world will depend on us
3325 2018-11-26 19:23:38 I use Shea butter at night. And use Marula oil to seal a body butter. I've got dry skin. Also my face routine is different. I use serums and oils at night. And use moisturizer and SPF in the mornza.
3326 2018-11-26 19:23:27 Joe, please look into cannabis oil, it's your best bet, and no side effects. Sending love and prayers your way my friend. All the best!
3327 2018-11-26 19:23:24 With confidence!
3328 2018-11-26 19:23:23 Deep Conditioning Masque. And Wild Growth Hair Oil. I also used Aloe Vera straight from the plant and it helped!
3329 2018-11-26 19:23:21 green tea bags or lemon specifically help with pigmentation. But Sunflower Seed Oil is the best,, is hydrates ur skin and removes dead skin cells;if you ever have bumps or pimples, the oil takes them away within a few days. You simply just rub the oil on face.
3330 2018-11-26 19:23:16 It wasn't about oil. Was about oil names relative to oil. So, you are misremembering
3331 2018-11-26 19:23:14 No bite, push your cuticles back and get some jajoba oil offline to restore your phalanges. Jajoba is the closest to what our body naturally produces in oils so its good shit
3332 2018-11-26 19:23:06 The US owns the largest share of Canadian oil - end of story
3333 2018-11-26 19:22:54 Welcome back Big Mac!
3334 2018-11-26 19:22:52 Well, at the moment, the USA is a net oil exporter, so hopefully our activities in the middle east will see a long-term decline. Hopefully we also rely a bit more on nuclear energy in the future. On the other hand, you have China stripping Africa of its resources.
3335 2018-11-26 19:22:46 Another international drama to hike the oil prices
3336 2018-11-26 19:22:44 SaNa OiL
3337 2018-11-26 19:22:43 I oil up at night. Otherwise my skin peels.
3338 2018-11-26 19:22:37 It’s dumb for that, and for the comparison to studies on the flip side.

Cuz there’s no corporate bias involved in the studies saying it’s not real or that there’s no damage from oil, fracking etc because profits.
3339 2018-11-26 19:22:31 Biotin pills, wash your hair as least often as possible and oil your scalp frequently
3340 2018-11-26 19:22:28 If u put like aragon oil in ur hair when its wet itll make the dye fade faster and restore ur tramatized hair

3343 2018-11-26 19:22:01 LPG is fierce expensive compared to oil, I'd stick with our personally
3344 2018-11-26 19:21:59 Im talking about how oil extraction hurts the environment, and ultimately we need to shift away from oil.

Pipelines remain the safest way to transport oil over land, but we need to look at the bigger picture too
3345 2018-11-26 19:21:57 That oil holding on well to ensure a lovely lasting..
3346 2018-11-26 19:21:55 1/2 This is really really bad- first Albert gets a kick in the ass with oil and pipelines and now this- middle class u said? Government doesn’t give a shit about how their political regulations and new laws can screw things up for the ..
3347 2018-11-26 19:21:53 How about a fetish for the abundance of dirty oil spills under cars, is this one bad?
3348 2018-11-26 19:21:48 McLaurin said "We actually love Lucas Oil Stadium" and the speedy surface there where the B1G title game is being played.
3349 2018-11-26 19:21:35 Terry McLaurin on playing in Indianapolis: "We actually love Lucas Oil Stadium. The turf is great ... it's a really fast field, and we hope to use our speed to our advantage."
3350 2018-11-26 19:21:28 $25 Oil is better 
3351 2018-11-26 19:21:22 @CNN I thought an apple is still an apple even when someone says it’s a banana....so that’s just a cute slogan, eh? Delay? BIG OIL TEXAS? I don’t think it takes a genius to figure out a connection.

3356 2018-11-26 19:20:59 "Venezuela’s aging fields fell by more than 700,000 barrels a day over the past year, according to the IEA." What's important to understand in addition is that no new investments are flowing into #Venezuela #oil sector which makes it's vast reserves inaccessible for longer #OOTT
3357 2018-11-26 19:20:57 lmao Trump really tweeted thanks to himself for lowering oil prices, a thing that happens so predictably in winter that you could set your calendar by it
3358 2018-11-26 19:20:25 Try...Trader Joe’s: Multigrain Rustico Bread, Avocado, Olive Oil, Red Chili Pepper or Basil, then some  Himalayan Sea Salt. 
3359 2018-11-26 19:20:23 Sounds like the “I don’t need oil, I ride the bus” statement.
3360 2018-11-26 19:20:08 Hei,  we are roasted o.. Without oil sef..forget the shinkili rain..  The heat here tie akochie.. 
3361 2018-11-26 19:20:04 "Data is the new oil" [phrase repeated at #bim4fmhub - remember, it's rarely used in its crude form, we often refine it to extract more valuable product]
3362 2018-11-26 19:20:02 Perhaps you could go work for the Saudis, since Trudeau thinks getting their oil is the best thing to do.
3363 2018-11-26 19:20:00 Yes @tfwrail I did it on the train home. Being careful to not touch anything painted. If you want my advice why you have the problem is it's not hot enough for the paint to set. Most oil based paint needs to be applied at a 10 degree ambient temperature. #readtheinstructions. 
3364 2018-11-26 19:19:51 What a crock of shit.While CPC is pushing oil GM is abandoning gas cars for electric.
Just read GM's statement

3366 2018-11-26 19:19:45 I think you are taking the report out of context. Shell and ENI did not defraud the Nigerian government of $6bln. They actually paid over $1bln which was looted and shared by officials of the past government. No oil has been produced from the block, no revenues derived to date.
3367 2018-11-26 19:19:42 hmm, It is not spicy that much but more like cooking condiment for more flavor. It is just chili oil also called rāyu (ラー油 or 辣油) in Japan.

3376 2018-11-26 19:18:58 @CameronAhmad think they could go out west & build pipe lines after all Trudeau bought one for $4B.Oh sorry what was I thinking liberals hate Canadian oil but that Saudi oil lap it up by the tankers. Hypocrites. You think the leader of the union and PM would have seen this coming

3381 2018-11-26 19:18:38 It will remain impossible for decades for anthropogenic CO2 to exceed the planet's ability to consume it. This is WHY atmospheric concentrations of ALL CO2 remain below 1/10th of 1%.

Very probably, we will run out of oil before this happens.
3382 2018-11-26 19:18:35 We should build a pipeline for export to decrease the amount of Saudi oil we use? Huh?
3383 2018-11-26 19:18:32 Stay in your lane Tammy, which I assume is littered w oil barrels, empty nail polish bottles, and American flag underwear.

3385 2018-11-26 19:18:15 What kind of pan are you using? Oh! And do you put butter or oil on it?
3386 2018-11-26 19:18:05 I'll keep this concise & simple: Oil is economically volatile. As extraction costs rise, taxable profits drop.  Nobody ever said Oil was bad for Scotland.  Cooler heads pointed out it was folly to depend on it.   Ask anybody in Aberdeen.

3388 2018-11-26 19:17:58 No acid needed and if dry oil then no water injection...air to be monitored is no big deal.
3389 2018-11-26 19:17:55 Oh, so that’s what is all about then? You’re just sad that City wasn’t in the list then. No one is taking away what they done, but when you’re fueled by oil money, you are basically buying the League. We had to sell our best player to actually make some decent purchases.
3390 2018-11-26 19:17:55 Bloomberg hates soda, alcohol, and oil.  He'd make a good Amish.
3391 2018-11-26 19:17:55 4/10. Too much oil.

3396 2018-11-26 19:17:28 It comes from pipes, doesn't it?  And the pipes come right into your house.  
Electricity is the same except using wires.  Clean fuel.

3398 2018-11-26 19:17:14 Sooo. GM builds cars that use fossil fuels. You hate oil and don’t support suffering oil workers.  But you’ll help auto workers?  Hypocrisy?
3399 2018-11-26 19:17:01 The Alberta oilpatch never got this coverage when 50X the number of layoffs occurred that the UNIFOR union members building fossil fueled cars are getting.
It's about the journalists union not oil
#cdnpoli
3400 2018-11-26 19:17:00 But I also agree near term a relatively minor (and seen many times in the past) oil price jump will create a rapid demand shift back to smaller vehicles, particularly in urban area, decimating US manufacturers.
3401 2018-11-26 19:16:59 What did we learn from Sun's Sabbath Gasbag climate change imbroglio? 
What did U learn @brianstelter? An urgent finding was dumped on Fri & oil/gas surrogates from that sector & the Trump Admin undermined the discussion w/ "I'm not a scientist but..." and lack of disclosure.
3402 2018-11-26 19:16:59 If you can't sideload it I don't know Apple. But you can send APK By Bluetooth and install oil install it that way.

3406 2018-11-26 19:16:36 @mark_dow your point is that "oil field decay" is already in the price, offset by "peak oil demand" new narrative?
3407 2018-11-26 19:16:34 i bleach my own hair and i got some tips. Use a conditioner with protein in it & make sure to let your contitioner sit before rinsing it off. & I always put some hair oil in my hair after i wash it.
3408 2018-11-26 19:16:34 What's with all this crap about people knowing what they were voting for on brexit re: leaving structures, single market etc? I spoke to a bloke from Scunthorpe once who voted leave because the Polish fella down the street has 3 cars in his garden leaking oil. Nothing to do

3410 2018-11-26 19:16:18 Excellent observation Nancy! CBD oil brands actually are not allowed to do advertising on popular channels including Facebook, IG and Twitter  Even services such as Mailchimp do not allow CBD oil email marketing. Pinterest did allow it for about a week but then redacted it :/

3415 2018-11-26 19:15:59 We need to use this as a serious wake up call and begin rapidly moving to renewables. Not just for the environment, but to provide jobs, and diversify away from oil and gas.

3419 2018-11-26 19:15:29 donations from the oil industry should be a huge red flag. do you think he was gonna just use that money and not influence policy in favor of the oil and gas industry? beto would be a huge detriment to curbing climate change.
3420 2018-11-26 19:15:25 Oil companies are addicted to profiting off extracting and selling carbon energy. Americans are addicted to energy consumption. Oil companies spread propaganda (not happening, not bad, not our fault, scientific conspiracy) and energy addicts lap it up and repeat it.
3421 2018-11-26 19:15:19 Why not just pour boiling oil on them?

I mean, that's what you want this to escalate to, right, Tampa?
3422 2018-11-26 19:15:17 "West Texas.. oil wells produce more natural gas than there are pipes to carry it away".  An article in the Chronicle the other day showed 16 pipelines under construction from West Texas to the Houston area.  How can their completion be accelerated?
3423 2018-11-26 19:15:17 You seem nervous Donnie... Maybe some lavender oil in a nice bubble bath? Or a Polonium Diet Coke?
3424 2018-11-26 19:15:08 Every 4k-5k miles on a new car you should always do an oil change

3432 2018-11-26 19:14:13 Go forth and explore Uranus.Might be lots of gas and oil up there for Canadians.

3435 2018-11-26 19:13:52 Importing oil from the Saudis is better?
3436 2018-11-26 19:13:46 Why not make it illegal to buy an asset (oil or gas well, gas plant, pipeline, etc) whose clean-up liabilities are beyond the purchaser's financial capability? #ableg #cdnpoli
3437 2018-11-26 19:13:45 The biases of journalists - and some are more partisan than others - are irrelevant to reality. There are no secret oil fields. I does not matter how partisan a journalist was, he or she could not retract a story highlighting such fake news. Reality matters.

3439 2018-11-26 19:13:40 i got an oil change, cleaned my car, and went to the bank: all while trying not to vomit with this hangover.
3440 2018-11-26 19:13:39 Would love to, as soon as we're independent, taking back our oil would be a reserved issue! Could you name one just one thatcher policy that Blair reversed or a redistributed policy he done or by @scottishlabour in the Scottish Parliament years ago- take your time #indyref2
3441 2018-11-26 19:13:37 Are we reducing overall production of gas guzzling vehicles? How much will this decrease demand for oil in the US & Canada?
3442 2018-11-26 19:13:29 What is best brand for CBD oil.  I see lots of hemp oil ads but none on cbd?
3443 2018-11-26 19:13:07 An important difference is that the oil sands have wanted support and help from the government to get approval so Industry can build pipelines, *not* handouts.

3450 2018-11-26 19:12:43 It's train transport which does much more damage to the environment, and why is it ok to import oil from the Saudis? Is that environmentally responsible?  Consider all the facts, please.
3451 2018-11-26 19:12:42 Might as well start buying up anything and everything ... state ran oil industry, state ran journalists and now state ran car manufacturing ... not scary to anyone????
3452 2018-11-26 19:12:37 Shades of Back To the Future -they've now developed biogas from rotting fish and other organic waste! I wonder how long it will be before we see that as an option for our vehicles--if the oil and gas companies have any say, I'm sure it'll be a long time. . . .
3453 2018-11-26 19:12:34 Disappointment? How about more emotion. They were bailed out years ago & you forgave that debt only for them to turn around & "close up shop". You should be angry as hell! It's the same story for Alberta oil & pipeline industries, Steel & aluminum, Quebec Aerospace #cdnpoli

3456 2018-11-26 19:12:26 Bottom line is, the old play where production cuts by OPEC can sustain high oil prices, may not be feasible due to cheap and abundant US shale oil.

3474 2018-11-26 19:10:48 Oil is sold in a market. As our production increases, we'll be able to leave contracts for exporting liquids and funnel our own oil into production. It's certainly not instantaneous.
The point is we'll no longer be dependent on folks who want to harm us for our oil supply.
3475 2018-11-26 19:10:46 Over lifetime, same general concerns will morph in specific focus, say liberal on environ. concerns and anti-war would in:
70s - be anti Vietnam war and anti chemical pollution of air and water
80s, anti nukes, anti cold war
00s, anti Iraq war, anti coal and oil, climate change
3476 2018-11-26 19:10:37 Nice addition of the ‘sizzle’ noise as he’s adding the batter to clap cold oil....
3477 2018-11-26 19:10:37 So greedy shareholders and executives. What a surprise. It's the same issue here 8n Alberta although the oil workers don't seem to get it.
3478 2018-11-26 19:10:31 It really should not rust with this basic maintenance. It can only rust with moisture and without the seal the seasoning with oil creates. But if it does, you can remove the rust with a scrub and then do this process to get back to normal.
3479 2018-11-26 19:10:24 Permit issued ....so work can  start now. No acid needed and water injection not needed if dry oil.   Monitoring of air is on going .

3487 2018-11-26 19:09:50 If oil prices half that of its forecast won't get the BoC to pause, perhaps the recent news out of Oshawa will. Surprised that the CAD holding steady at 76.

3489 2018-11-26 19:09:41 "Enjoy".. You sound like the the creapiest used car dealer ever. "Congratulations" oil is ALMOST as cheap as when I took office. "tremendous".. "Enjoy" your "big beautiful" impeachment.. "Believe me". We will..

3501 2018-11-26 19:09:05 $4 a barrel oil would bankrupt the Saudis... $6 gas would be a big problem here in the US (it was $6.57 equivalent in the UK earlier this year).

3513 2018-11-26 19:08:09 This is what happens when Canada relies so heavily on one other country, this was going to happen eventually which is why we need that oil pipeline from coast to coast people we need to be more self sufficient what is it going to take for people to understand all this?

3520 2018-11-26 19:07:26 I'm due for an oil change.
3521 2018-11-26 19:07:22 I use to be a labor hand then a driver and now I have more stable hours until the price of oil hits the roof then I'm back to 80 plus hours a week

3524 2018-11-26 19:07:11 1 foreseeable collateral damage from the ouster of #Trump is skyrocketing #oil prices because another president mightn’t be game for hush $$
3525 2018-11-26 19:07:08 The point is it is not a sink hole yet, and they are doing the work to get it on track to handle Alberta oil. (And your 1.55% return is based on a few months) Don't get me wrong, I would prefer for the pipeline to be pushed through, but lets put things in proper perspective.
3526 2018-11-26 19:06:56 Don't forget the oil industry. Lots of freemarket types behind this concept.
3527 2018-11-26 19:06:46 Glad you got to go to the game . I couldn’t afford to go because oil prices are at a all time low . So awesome to see you having a great time while Alberta starves . GOOD JOB
3528 2018-11-26 19:06:45 My dude would make bho in the 80s with a brass tube and fittings  mfers act like hash oil is new. Our parents were smoking Thai sticks which was the oil left from pressing bricks of Mexican mid. Lmfaoooo
3529 2018-11-26 19:06:39 Multi-ccy oil pricings affect dollar-hegemony much more. If US is serious about retaining the ability to print greenbacks ad infinitum, then it must strangle the petroyuan while it still can. Or, is it too late already?

SNOWBALL  EFFECT  EITHER WAY. RISE IN OIL HAS NEGATIVE SNOWBALL EFFECT IN ECONOMY.
3531 2018-11-26 19:06:25 I’ll cut ‘em some slack because it’s on the inside edge HOWEVER that has been there for some time so THAT kids is why I harp on y’all about oil changes. You catch that stuff
3532 2018-11-26 19:06:17 If UK Navy nearby - likelihood VERY high. SADM would close access to Sea of Azov and limit Russia's ability to move crude oil - damaging their economy.
3533 2018-11-26 19:06:16 if anyone is interested in how this works, essentially rapid cell generation, the cells eat & produce oil as output (like a black box)
Drain oil & keep feeding the blob nutrients... it will surpass all current oil production in every way within a decade or 2
Too easy, all good!
3534 2018-11-26 19:06:13 Aldente woke up early and was able to charge her eyelid chakras when Garcia prepared his morning Chakra and Sons ceremonies. Each piece in her Etsy store was made from hand-picked coconut shell, she infused essential oil chakras into every piece. Her chakras glowed.

3535 2018-11-26 19:06:09 What on earth do you have to do with the price of oil? Is it payback for you looking the other way when the Saudis killed Jamal Khashoggi?
3536 2018-11-26 19:06:07 OPEC countries are trying to take advantage of the bull run in crude prices to augment lost revenues since 2015. Lower oil prices now indicate a pre 2018 scenario... no one wants to be caught in the middle of managing budgetary demands vis a vis low oil prices.

3538 2018-11-26 19:05:57 Thank you for speaking up for the oil sector. Hopefully everyone will make sure Trudeau doesn’t get 4 more years.
3539 2018-11-26 19:05:56 When I pulled into Express Oil Change and the man told me they don't change oil and I actually fell for it. I'm just as gullible as I was in fourth grade when I looked up gullible in the dictionary.

3546 2018-11-26 19:05:20 So do several other job sectors? Those who work on Offshore Oil Platforms, container ships crew and so forth. I don’t dispute the sacrifices those in the military Male but I don’t see why they feel they should be entitled to so many discounts?
3547 2018-11-26 19:05:19 WA's rejection of carbon tax propositions is a case-in-point. As astute political economists such as @MarkJaccard argue, policy labelled "TAX" make an easy mark for deep-pocket oil, gas and coal biz. Targeted regulation is less politically vulnerable.

Well if a flood of cheap oil hadn't sunk gas prices, maybe Americans would think twice about choosing SUVs over more efficient vehicles?
3554 2018-11-26 19:04:39 Shale companies haven't been able to generate free cash flow, despite great oil supply growth. Saudis budget b/e oil px of Brnt $73/bbl. Something has to break, and I dont think mass EV will come faster than oil spike caused by s/t underinvestment. Could be USDSAR, yes.
3555 2018-11-26 19:04:39 I remember during yaradua regime wen 1 of the top Nigerian oil company owners said had it been he married his daughter he was dating, he don't ve 2 follow any procedure on lifting oil his ships will just be loaded 4 free
3556 2018-11-26 19:04:27 Instead of oil you could use magnesium salt in a bathtub. 
If you have one, that is.
3557 2018-11-26 19:04:10 Oil prices falling is not because of you. Also they were at record lows with Obama so you should be denying any ties to this, since it being true would make Obama better than you
3558 2018-11-26 19:04:02 @RepPeterDeFazio @Politico As an Oregonian I am ASHAMED of you and your resistance to a Green New Deal. The earth is dying--whether "realistic" or not, we have to at least TRY to meet what may seem impossible goals. How much $$ are you taking from Big Oil?
3559 2018-11-26 19:03:59 Also, rub tea tree oil on your outbreaks before bed, wake up clear n dried up! Just be sure you moisturize well in the morning if you have dry skin already. My skins in the middle so it doesn’t dry it out completely or leave it oily!

3561 2018-11-26 19:03:50 What really kills me here is that right now, or soon, we will have perhaps thousands of new sources for better & cheaper oils that do not harm humans or other nature in any way.
We can take a batch of cells that produce any oil, build a large batch, feed & water & drain the oil.
3562 2018-11-26 19:03:45 is the apple cider oil a bio oil? whatever it is, it works v well
3563 2018-11-26 19:03:27 Condy can be defined as well permit or API. I view API as the better demarcation factor bc that has a lot more to do with the ability to use condy as light oil vs more NGL-like.....and APIs of fields can change over time and thus its more fluid than many think...
3564 2018-11-26 19:03:22 nothing yet but it’s really only a matter of time until i accidentally inject lavender oil or huff some hormonez
3565 2018-11-26 19:03:22 Sentiment rebounded on little news. The S&P500 is up 1.0%, oil is up 3%, and US bond yields and the US dollar are slightly higher.
3566 2018-11-26 19:03:17 But without control over Immigration it will be Westminster to decide not Scotland who comes in. Thatcher suppressed the true extent of Scotland's Oil for 30 years so are you seriously telling us that Westminster will have regard for Scotland in this?
3567 2018-11-26 19:03:13 Every new oil well makes it more impossible. I'd give them half just to be shot of them. Bargain!
3568 2018-11-26 19:03:08 Economics would suggest it's because people are using less oil even though average MPG for fleet is decreasing.

Supply and demand seek balance at equilibrium price. Supply didn't increase, so demand must be flagging.

I think it's because people are scared and staying home.
3569 2018-11-26 19:03:03 Why are you not helping yemon than?? It’s your Vito stopping it - perhaps it’s because they have no oil and you don’t wanna piss off the saudis ??
3570 2018-11-26 19:02:51 i bet my scalp would appreciate if i didn’t oil it up by running my hands through my hair every 2 minutes
i ain’t gonna tho
3571 2018-11-26 19:02:41 Car sharing and autonomous vehicles are great in urban areas, but much less attractive in all the rural and exurban areas. So I’m with Mark: if oil goes up to $4.00/gallon again, the US car makers will be in a world of hurt.
3572 2018-11-26 19:02:27 Snake oil salesman. Slimy and untrustworthy.
3573 2018-11-26 19:02:14 Now that we are one of the biggest producers of oil isn’t this hurting our own industry ?
3574 2018-11-26 19:02:14 Tow, Allah Ya tsare mu
3575 2018-11-26 19:02:11 @drvox Some of the current skepticism about climate change could be legacy of false 1970's forecasts that world would "run out of oil" by 1985. Thoughts?
3576 2018-11-26 19:02:00 The anti--war , anti-globalist protesters have known this but no one listened.  We paid for the murders so we could get cheap oil so it's only fair to let the peaceful, well funded, well clothed asylum seekers in on our booty. Really working well in Europe.
3577 2018-11-26 19:01:57 Try some coconut oil mixed into a hot tea or coffee. Should help.
3578 2018-11-26 19:01:54 Persistence pays off... or as my nana used to say “the squeaky gate gets the oil” 
3579 2018-11-26 19:01:53 The price of #oil will likely remain “nice” as long as #Trump plays “nice” & doesn’t ever utter the name #JamalKashoggi or mention #Yemen 
3580 2018-11-26 19:01:48 Thank our “fearless leader”. He has singlehandedly fucked the oil and gas industry and will do the same to our auto industry. I’m not really surprised. His father was the same.
3581 2018-11-26 19:01:36 That very nice but I just need a quick polish and a hook up for my favorite brand of obelisk oil.
3582 2018-11-26 19:01:19 So your plan is to make us defenseless, raise the price we pay for fuel, and endanger the environment by trucking oil instead of sending it through a pipeline? That's your proposal?  Thanks for the warning!
3583 2018-11-26 19:01:17 9/11 was a threat.

“Don’t leave us to die when the oil’s gone. We’ll kill you for committing the violent act of leaving us to die in the desert.”

Green energy is a problem for the Middle East. Their gold is a darker hue; black.

Red Indians used to draw borders too, fuckface.

3585 2018-11-26 19:00:59 Mmmm From the oil embargo of 73, to terrorists from 9/11, now killing journalists...I’m starting to a pattern. But trump just sees cash 
3586 2018-11-26 19:00:58 We thank Canada for the price cuts, as most of our Oil comes from them. 

While you "President T" traded with Saudi Arabia for money and oil... with the life of Jamal Khaahoggi.
3587 2018-11-26 19:00:56 So, here’s my to-do list: 1) give employers tax incentives for telecommuting where possible; 2) tax the fuck out of beef and palm oil; 3) put people to work building public transportation infrastructure; 4) switch to clean energy.
3588 2018-11-26 19:00:54 We r doomed as criminal corporations run by uncaring psychopaths rule the world. Over packaging, duplication and waste alone will kill us. Hot wars, dinosaur oil economy, unregulated corp. animal farms, Military I. Complex, burning coal, etc. etc. will guarantee our fiery demise.
3589 2018-11-26 19:00:49 Some of the arguments with regard to technological change are reasons for deep thought, but the way the market is(n't) rewarding E&Ps and oil price levels means if there's a mistake estimating growing demand there should be a squeeze like the one seen in 2002-2008 in my opinion.

3593 2018-11-26 19:00:37 And what wired view on earth do u have. Of course I do not want to have anybody having a finger on a red button. Not Kimmy, Nor Putin, nor Trumpy. Oil and gas are limited, get over it.

3614 2018-11-26 18:58:41 It depends on the type and quality of oil a lot. People who've had fruitless experiences may not be using it right I guess
3615 2018-11-26 18:58:39 GM is downsizing. Not just in Canada, but in the US and other countries.   Harper would not have been able to change this.   Manufacturing is not what it used to be.  We need to focus on industries of the future.  The world is moving past Auto and Oil - Canada should too
3616 2018-11-26 18:58:34 I think governance through the rear-view mirror has only reaction to offer. There seems no understanding of, no vision for what is happening on this planet. Those chosen to lead are instead offering only a denial that oil & the oil auto industries are of the past.
3617 2018-11-26 18:58:33 I have an ear full of olive oil for some fucking reason.

3622 2018-11-26 18:58:26 Indeed. And that's why they're dangerous. They sell snake oil but make the customer think they have security, when they don't. Maybe using IPtables or a "set the ACK flag, slip through" ACL. It's a vendor problem, for sure; makes my job harder. :)

3624 2018-11-26 18:58:22 If you actually did any research on the oils Sands you would know it is one of the most regulated areas of the oil industry anywhere and it is always evolving and innovation. Another inconvenient truth for you I suppose
3625 2018-11-26 18:58:13 The fact that we need the middle east in the alliance as a front toward oil reserves to keep the war from our shores. 

That's a fact... No one knows we need middle east to keep our nation safe. Any long war towards the US , we would be in horrible shape.. Values yes, safety firs

3641 2018-11-26 18:56:18 The value of that oil field alone is almost $500B when exploited but No the myopic and wicked people gave it out for $1.1B and use the rest for toys
3642 2018-11-26 18:56:18 I'm old enough to remember when science was respected. Climate change deniers are stupid, and those who shill for the oil industry, criminal.  #tomdelay #resist
3643 2018-11-26 18:56:17 How much money has Suzuki donated to land lock our oil through the Tar Sands Campaign. Oh right, that is an inconvenient truth for those who refuse to acknowledge that such a campaign exists. @FairQuestions
3644 2018-11-26 18:56:17 It takes money to make money. We all know that. 

The previous PC government spent our oil revenues willy nilly. 

We need to make money again and use our revenues to develop better, non-oil based transport, etc.

The more independent from other countries we are the better!

3646 2018-11-26 18:56:10 67% of Primary Energy is thermal waste from coal, gas, oil and nuclear power. There is no insight to be gained from discussing it.

Also "negotiating with Jello" reform bill during last time's threat of shutdown

ALSO...
Trump's going to get away with promising voters that Mexico would pay for his wall & now demanding that Ds pay for it, right? WTF???

How does he sell this snake oil? smmfh
3660 2018-11-26 18:55:17 Alberta oil selling for $13.  Brent still over 50...   overproduction didn't cause that difference.
3661 2018-11-26 18:55:13 And we'll run out of oil by 2020....
3662 2018-11-26 18:55:00 The Khashoggi murder may have been a heinous act, he was no innocent journalist. He was Muslim Brotherhood. Our support of Saudi Arabia has nothing to do with oil prices or weapons sales, but everything to do with Iran and their support of Muslim Brotherhood, Hamas and Hezbollah.
3663 2018-11-26 18:54:46 Gov. Abbott is a hero, he almost had to make Texas a separate country to save it from 0bama shutting down MEAT and OIL industries 2 bring poverty

3664 2018-11-26 18:54:46 WSJ = Unless of course there is oil underground.
3665 2018-11-26 18:54:45 It’s the create a problem that doesn’t exist. Then have a solution that only benefits them. Decentralized markets don’t have unified prices. This is not gold or oil. Bakkt is just another on ramp.
3666 2018-11-26 18:54:41 @POTUS it was not OPEC that lowered oil prices it was all the drilling in the US. can we just get the facts straight. While ur worrying about immigrants and border Putin is annexing Crimea. Which one do u see as bigger threat?
3667 2018-11-26 18:54:39 It does that with all resources and I mean I want to build foundries or resources like the oil refinery and put the resources where there were none.

3670 2018-11-26 18:54:33 Oil breaks above $60, but doubts about growth curb gains: Oil prices rose about three percent on Monday, clawing back some of the previous session's steep losses, although uncertainty over global economic growth and further signs of increasing supply put a cap on gains.
3671 2018-11-26 18:54:27 Guys, lets settle this. 
Does oil really help prevent baldness and strengthen hair?
3672 2018-11-26 18:54:11 Well as it could I guess. Happened outside a shop. Moms off today so I have a car and the shop is gonna throw the doughnut on and give me an oil change. #GlassHalfFull

3675 2018-11-26 18:54:07 We Indians have started not to worry about the oil price hikes, since we have started using electric cars.

3677 2018-11-26 18:54:05 It's ok he thinks export is the same as tax revenue on oil.  Ignore it.
3678 2018-11-26 18:54:00 A decade ago, the U.S. mandated the use of vegetable oil in biofuels, leading to industrial-scale deforestation — and a huge spike in carbon emissions.
3679 2018-11-26 18:53:58 We had an experiment in A&P today where we were testing our sense of smell & we had to sniff Clove Oil. And now I get to smell it all day because it has yet to leave my system.
3680 2018-11-26 18:53:57 Losing billions? Jesus christ ... would you like the green, orange or purple koolaid? The US has amassed billions in sales to Canada, gets raw materials from us at discounted rates, gets Canadian oil for 20% of the world market price, and he's bitching about 800k dairy deficit.
3681 2018-11-26 18:53:52 Key economic indicators show that we are headed for a crash. Trump and the Establishment are looking for scapegoats. The truth is it's the rising interest rates, the rising price of oil, & the ridiculous tax cut that went to the wealthy but should have went to the Middle Class.
3682 2018-11-26 18:53:31 Imagine the price of EVERYTHING if gasoline ceases to be used. When oil prices shot to their highest prices of cosmetics, plastics and nearly everything else rose too. Oil isn't just gas.
3683 2018-11-26 18:53:31 But why did GM desperately cling to big oil? Why didn't they innovate with changing need for carbon reduction? #CutTheirOwnThroats

Have a rota for marking so you can manage workload.
3687 2018-11-26 18:53:16 Yeah, I would have thought when the president opened up all the other oil reserves for drilling it would have had an impact. You know reducing our dependence on foreign oil? But it seems he’s now relying on Saudi Arabia to reduce oil prices. #fraud #impeachthisasshole
3688 2018-11-26 18:53:07 If conservatives are only going to come from the position of money it’s a non starter anyway. Oil and gas could be leading the way instead they are doing anything to ensure their profits are the only concern no matter who it hurts
3689 2018-11-26 18:52:58 Totally agree. People here are investing in the hype, expecting investors from outside Bahrain to come and invest in startups (which is not practically productive). This is not offshore banking or oil related business!
3690 2018-11-26 18:52:53 Oil pipelines over aquafur in the middle of the country will guarantee destruction of drinking water and food production with one accident! What are our supposed leaders thinking?

3692 2018-11-26 18:52:24 The price of oil will increase and Putin will continue to be able to pay state salaries and pensions.

3694 2018-11-26 18:52:06 In the Great Depression here in America people burned their dollar bills for heat.  The dollar was worthless and it gave more BTU value than oil.

3697 2018-11-26 18:52:00 Oil prices rose about 3 percent on Monday, clawing back some of  the previous session's steep losses, although gains where capped by  uncertainty over global economic growth and further signs of increasing  supply, including record Saudi production.
3698 2018-11-26 18:51:59 Indeed. And are all the leaders joining the rush for oil and gas only pretending to take climate change seriously?
3699 2018-11-26 18:51:58 Massive tax increases for companies extracting oil and natural gas. Burning coal should be illegal. Countries that produce a lot of renewable energy should get listened to a lot more in general but also in important decisions regarding the environment.

3702 2018-11-26 18:51:31 RT @Numerologynow: #BITCOIN is just like the @federalreserve

BITCOIN WILL BE NEXT TO WOETHLESS 

THAT DAY WILL COME

3703 2018-11-26 18:51:28 But i guess they *are* scientists when they talk about the safety of coal or oil pipelines?
3704 2018-11-26 18:51:27 @johnastoehr I have a question, I wonder if you can help on what seems to be propaganda from the oil and gas industry. I keep hearing from friends and family in Canada something I presume are outrageous smears of their environmental activists. Is there a debunk link to send them?
3705 2018-11-26 18:51:22 Time 2 burn d midnight oil
3706 2018-11-26 18:51:20 Where I agree is that we get away from burning oil/coal.  It’s dirty, backwards & hold humanity back from development.  Solar & wind are also nonsense from a global solution view (a fact).  We need cheap nextgen nuclear power to drive us into the next 100 years.  See China.

3710 2018-11-26 18:51:09 Only a fool takes credit for something he did not do. Especially, when oil prices normally drop during this period of the year.
3711 2018-11-26 18:51:08 Your “I’m not a scientist....” qualifier was a talking point for RWNJ Climate Deniers a few years back when all the science/scientists (not funded by oil co.’s) provided evidence climate change is real And so now here you are STILL trying to rehash the old lie! You’re disgusting!
3712 2018-11-26 18:50:56 .....Nah turn by turn Nigeria Plc.... Open stock taking.... The fact that our Oil hasn't dried up till now and still delivers money for thievery then God blesses us not fluke.
3713 2018-11-26 18:50:51 Nationalize?? Really? Where have you been on the Alberta Oil Patch workers?
3714 2018-11-26 18:50:46 @ZellnerLaw just read an interesting article about your father discovering oil in the north Sea...... Was he Welsh? If so what part of Wales was he from?

3717 2018-11-26 18:50:22 Where they tell you in commercials and photos they use shaving cream for whipped cream and motor oil instead of maple syrup and they put a cup under soup so anything on top stays on top
3718 2018-11-26 18:50:15 Let’s not forget-one day oil/coal will run out, and as we approach that their prices will rise. 
Solar and Wind energy requires low maintenance cost, and provides very cheap energy. There’s a cost of living argument here too
3719 2018-11-26 18:50:14 What’s the oil companies paying rickie to spew out his vas scientific knowledge on climate change?
3720 2018-11-26 18:49:50 THE LEADERS OF A LOT OF COUNTRIES ALL AROUND US ARE VERY DETRIMENTAL IN THERE THINKING OF HOW TO MAKE THERE OWN COUNTRY SUCCESSFUL. ITS ABT NATIONALIZEM. THEY DO NOT GET TRUMPS THINKING IN THERE OWN MINDS. THEY KEEP MAKING BAD DECISIONS FOR THERE CITIZENS. THAT CAUSES TERM OIL.
3721 2018-11-26 18:49:46 I should probably change my oil now so I can get a smog this weekend

3724 2018-11-26 18:49:38 Or you could tax the rich and corporations and leave the lower and middle classes out of it. But that gets passed on as well. I say charge what you would for oil present day and build nuclear plants and electric infrastructure for transportation and eventual tech breakthroughs
3725 2018-11-26 18:49:31 In vinegar 24H and then oil ... very very easy 
3726 2018-11-26 18:49:25 How you accidentally not get an oil change for 3 months?
3727 2018-11-26 18:49:15 As a scientist, I’m happy to explain science to the media, which seems hell-bent on hiring oil executives with no scientific background to shill propaganda.

3731 2018-11-26 18:48:54 Canada currently supplies 40% of America's oil.
3732 2018-11-26 18:48:53 i’m broke and i’m not in the oil fields idk what you’re talking about
3733 2018-11-26 18:48:42 Projected oil costs over the life of the project were way off. That's when I knew the jig was up. Numbers didn't jive with market realities of a oil crash. Never showed in their projections.
3734 2018-11-26 18:48:35 There are a lot of CBD oil MLM businesses. It's hard to tell if the products are actually high quality because most of what I see is from promoters. I do get DMs from time to time where people tell me they purchased from one them but didn't have good results. Just my experience
3735 2018-11-26 18:48:35 Argan oil is actually good oily skin.  It doesn't clog your pores and helps the pimple scars to fade again
3736 2018-11-26 18:48:29 We need less government in business, not more. Governments have consistently shown they're bad for business, just look at their help for the oil, automotive and media as examples. Any of them doing well?
3737 2018-11-26 18:48:29 I know how climate change denial is profitable; oil, gas and coal interests pay for it. But how the heck is "the politics of global warming" profitable? Who pays for that?
3738 2018-11-26 18:48:25 After all. ..look how well the Trudeau run oil pipeline is working out.
3739 2018-11-26 18:48:25 Well, big oil and car dealerships.

3746 2018-11-26 18:47:56 I've had a 2010 and now a 2015. I drive 'em until they rack up at least 100,000 miles plus, and have not had any problems. New tires & oil changes, that' it.
3747 2018-11-26 18:47:56 Why are they so bought out by oil & gas industries that they actually believe their own lies?!
3748 2018-11-26 18:47:52 Think I’m going to buy a rig and start smoking oil again 
3749 2018-11-26 18:47:48 the  point is  we  are  a  resource  based  economy ,  and  an  never  forget  that ....  we  have  the  oil already  to  sell , there  will  be  a  25  year  market  to  sell  the  oil , all  the  other  stuff may  not  apply  to Canada
3750 2018-11-26 18:47:45 Somehow in countries without endless supplies of oil, they’ve managed to innovate and improve efficiency. And yes, prices are high there for fuel. I’m not against a tax hike but people can’t think straight.  You say it and they start frothing at the mouth.
3751 2018-11-26 18:47:42 Theatre Academic Friends! I'm writing a lecture on McGrath's The Cheviot, the Stag and the Black, Black Oil, which I've not taught for a while. Any good sources on politics/class/etc in a broader British theatrical context (rather than just Scottish) that'd make my lecture swing?
3752 2018-11-26 18:47:39 ???? 

The issue is oil in Alberta sells for $11 while the same oil everywhere else in the world sells for close to $50 or even more. So if there were a way to transport that oil from Alberta to a place where the price is higher it would raise the price realized in Alberta. Hth.
3753 2018-11-26 18:47:39 I use special feeling leave in spray and mix it with coconut oil, olive oil, castor oil, and hair placenta

3755 2018-11-26 18:47:16 Glad to hear it. The "carbon tax" is garbage. So is the dairy subsidy. Oil and gas demand isn't going anywhere for a while, governments should stop pretending it is.

3759 2018-11-26 18:47:07 I guess some of this could be debated, but oil? Electric vehicles don't pollute and will require less maintenance because they have less moving parts. Oil NEEDS to die.
3760 2018-11-26 18:46:53 But Clinton Fdtn has been examined for a very long time - /Oil&gas since HRC's '08 run.

3769 2018-11-26 18:46:02 I'm trading on a pretty small account, so I played things like GPRO, TWTR, AMD and stuff like that. I recently had a pretty big shift in style to mostly trading ETFs/inverses in gold, S&P (shorts from the top and re-shorted bounce), and oil.
3770 2018-11-26 18:46:01 The man who is standing behind the child, with a beard, is no small man. That old snake oil salesman is probably lucky he didn't get his nose broke.
3771 2018-11-26 18:45:55 I think that everyone should be welcome to have a seat at the table. For example, there are clean energy champions within oil companies that can drive change from within.
3772 2018-11-26 18:45:45 Honey-lemon tea is something I've had before, but adding olive oil is a new concept for me. I'll have to try that when I get home!
Does any kind of olive oil work? I have a bottle of extra-virgin olive oil, the kind that has a slight bite & a natural, nearly spicy quality to it.
3773 2018-11-26 18:45:44 I have ongoing debate with my wife about this.  She argues that big oil shills like Santorum should be exposed.  I argue giving them a platform is dangerous and hurts credibility of outlets that feature them.

3775 2018-11-26 18:45:40 I’ve been stressfully sniffing my lavender oil like a junkie cos I constantly need to calm down loool happy days
3776 2018-11-26 18:45:38 It’s magic oil.
Where once 4 yrs ago there was just a big empty hole now it’s full of billions of barrels of oil.
Whoda kent it
3777 2018-11-26 18:45:36 Something in common? #Saudi has lots of crude oil, @realDonaldTrump is just crude
3778 2018-11-26 18:45:31 I only use tissue oil. In the mornza i use tissue oil and moisturizer
3779 2018-11-26 18:45:12 The most lucrative resource on this planet is oil. Not scientific theory.
3780 2018-11-26 18:44:33 And cheap oil
3781 2018-11-26 18:44:25 Tea tree is definitely better. It's anti fungal and helps with inflammation/irritation as well. Coconut oil is too heavy and clogs the pores
3782 2018-11-26 18:44:03 @ChrisCuomo I'm not surprised that @realDonaldTrump would dismiss the climate change report.  He's for Corporate America; they dont want their pockets touched. In my opinion that's the real reason Al Gore lost the election to Bush (major oil contributions). Gore was ready to work
3783 2018-11-26 18:43:59 Thank you President Trump for always putting America first! Love my tax cuts and love oil prices going down! More People were able to travel home for the holidays!

3785 2018-11-26 18:43:50 NOT this simple peeps! As mentioned in previous tweet Trump head-faked the Saudis into pumping even more oil. Told them he was gonna sanction Iran so SA could make up the difference. Then changed his mind & allowed several countries to continue buying from Iran, who kept pumping!
3786 2018-11-26 18:43:40 Today was a bad day to wear my slippers to work. I ended up having to run errands, one of those being an oil change. So I’m sitting in the waiting room. In slippers. That don’t even remotely match my outfit
3787 2018-11-26 18:43:29 Head is spinning at the different response to struggling ON workers vs AB. (Cars actually cause GHGs, the oil industry is only there because of the car industry....)
3788 2018-11-26 18:43:24 Just as a note, depending on who is measuring, the oil industry gets around $2-$3 billion in government subsidies every year.
3789 2018-11-26 18:43:24 Re Bank of Canada, WCS oil discount: “The spread is so extreme, the cries of pain from Alberta are so loud, I don’t think they can just put blinders on and carry on as if no thing’s changed,” Doug Porter, chief econ. at BMO, in interview about the central bank’s deliberations.
3790 2018-11-26 18:43:19 We appreciate it! When using Vanilla Oleoresin, we do recommend cleaning after each use with this oil!
3791 2018-11-26 18:43:14 well... something happened. Offers to buy stakes in Venezuela by large oil companies are not abundant nowadays

The recipe doesn't call for white truffle oil! What else you have…You are improvising!?
3794 2018-11-26 18:43:08 Your point MAY have some validity if Scotland was independent and if it had an ‘oil wealth fund’ but it isn’t and it doesn’t. The tax raised on oil will go to the UK exchequer council tax will continue to be paid by the Scottish people.
3795 2018-11-26 18:43:03 "I have more... elegant plans for you from now on," Dahlia assured.  "I may just bathe you in vanilla oil instead, give you to Satyr for an evening.  He does like his Christmas cookies. Haven't decided yet."

Pepper, wide-eyed, simply hung on her words, seemingly open to it all.
3796 2018-11-26 18:43:00 My mums been really sweet and try to buy stuff without palm oil in and she spent 20 minutes reading through instant noodle packets to try and find palm oil free ones
3797 2018-11-26 18:42:53 @LBC @Nigel_Farage don’t say we! Most don’t want their freedoms taken away! You are a snake oil salesman and a disgusting one at that
3798 2018-11-26 18:42:48 just doused myself in eucalyptus and peppermint oil. GO AWAY COLD
3799 2018-11-26 18:42:45 I wanna engage in oil retailing business, I don't mind you being my supplier
3800 2018-11-26 18:42:36 Wait like motor oil?
3801 2018-11-26 18:42:24 You synagogue Goya oil
3802 2018-11-26 18:42:19 Oil tanker caught fire near the main gate of Bhakti Park near Carnival Cinemas (IMAX) in Wadala around 11 pm. Fire brigade on spot. Firefighting underway. Further details awaited
3803 2018-11-26 18:42:17 I see people selling cbd oil... like an itworks type of business. Is that legit?!
3804 2018-11-26 18:42:16 Omg no one should own olive oil it’s a communal item and I stand by this
3805 2018-11-26 18:42:12 best purchase of 2018: my essential oil diffuser <3
3806 2018-11-26 18:42:10 So for the last week I've been using the jojoba oil I picked up (that I calmed down about and didn't return) and HOLY FUCK BALLS my skin feels incredible? Like who even knew?! Jojoba oil and pears soap. I'm living!!!
3807 2018-11-26 18:41:53 You mean used engine oil
3808 2018-11-26 18:41:47 Totally agree.  I still have my shorts open from $4910, I told myself I'll stop myself out before I close it early.  You said oil futures right?  Any in particular you like trading more than others? I'm assuming there's a bunch of them.
3809 2018-11-26 18:41:46 Why can’t I ever just go in and get an oil changed? Every time suddenly my air filter needs changed and windshield wipers are torn. Leave me alone and change my oil.
3810 2018-11-26 18:41:37 Describes the soybean/meal/oil markets perfectly
3811 2018-11-26 18:41:36 The people of Venezuela should benefit from that oil
3812 2018-11-26 18:41:32 @econjared There's no better #huckster than @realDonaldTrump 

Never has there been a President whose base fared so much less well as a result of policy initiatives than those opposing the same same POTUS

He continues to sell snake oil, but will eventually be run out of town
3813 2018-11-26 18:41:26 Quite the contrary. We have an independent watchdog. So do councillors. But - for the avoidance of doubts - claims of secret oil fields are demonstrably false. Any reporter who suggested otherwise would be open to a serious misconduct case.

3816 2018-11-26 18:41:18 Pretty sure GM just announced  they were laying off 14,000 people oil very low. I’m not a huge fan but this doesn’t seem booming to me!
3817 2018-11-26 18:41:17 So like My car is getting an oil change and they offered a shuttle service so I shuttled home and the guy who took me not only stared at me the whole time, when he dropped me off (at home) he asked my name and hugged me and tried to kiss my cheek. I hate men.
3818 2018-11-26 18:41:11 But just toss in the flavoring powder and/or seasoning oil.
3819 2018-11-26 18:41:09 Congratulations to our Oil City YMCA River Otters Swim Team for conducting their 50th Annual Thanksgiving Swim invitational on Saturday!
3820 2018-11-26 18:41:08 Indeed! are you on gas or oil heat?
3821 2018-11-26 18:41:00 I’m passing Honda thinking I probably need my oil changed soon. Not even a half mile later my service light came on. Like what?!?
3822 2018-11-26 18:41:00 Hey Dan wasn't so much a deal worked out with SA. Instead they got snookered by Trump's promise of sanctions against Iran. So they started pumping like crazy. Then Trump backed off & continued to allow certains countries to buy oil from Iran. So then Iran kept pumping. Big Glut!
3823 2018-11-26 18:40:58 CBD Oil... thoughts?
3824 2018-11-26 18:40:56 No, I use the same tissue oil, but change body, feet and face stuff.
3825 2018-11-26 18:40:55 And it kinda doesn't matter anyway. Technology is coming, and it's been creeping into the oil name narrative for well over a year now. The game is now deciding when, in its oscillations, the narrative is overdone vs underdone

Is it an oil or a cream I can rub on her?
3829 2018-11-26 18:40:48 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Philadelphia sleeps.
3830 2018-11-26 18:40:48 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Philadelphia sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
3831 2018-11-26 18:40:47 Did the reporters ask Bains about the $3.7B loan his boss just forgave to GM?

3854 2018-11-26 18:39:16 Having fiat global reserve currency to control oil & world trade *requires* outsourcing of industrial capacity so other countries (China, EU) can fund your endless deficits & military spending. We setup a system where we "export" IOUs for goods, while giving rest of world
3855 2018-11-26 18:39:16 Oh my Nigeria! So after 4yrs, you are posting these as an achievement by a president of over 200million ppl of an oil producing country? It's now obvious that some heads has nothing inside.....
3856 2018-11-26 18:39:11 I had some amazing taters with @ivycircuit and @meepmareep yesterday at a place in South Seattle. They were cooked in truffle oil.

3859 2018-11-26 18:39:00 How many times did they scream at the top of their lungs that Scotland had no oil left and that it would only cost billions to decommission - INCLUDING Clair Ridge that was of course totally depleted?  I call that 'hiding it'.
3860 2018-11-26 18:38:58 Oil fields? ;)
3861 2018-11-26 18:38:57 Gosh. Fruity, jammy, oaky Riesling with layers of concentrated chili oil.
3862 2018-11-26 18:38:54 By “a lot” he means the 3% paid by oil company think tanks...
3863 2018-11-26 18:38:35 It will forever be with you, those few horrifying seconds of that agonized rictus grin as flesh bone and teeth become steel, as the last few vital drops of human blood thicken into oil. Conversely, dat ass tho.
3864 2018-11-26 18:38:33 Any new research that challenges conventional wisdom that low oil prices are 100% good for the US given rise of fracking, the tax revenue, Perman Basin, jobs, etc.? Maybe @k1ug3 know 
3865 2018-11-26 18:38:29 God i need an oil wipe so bad
3866 2018-11-26 18:38:27 Just got my Pennzoil 5W-30 today for the oil change!
3867 2018-11-26 18:38:23 Media is full of lies about our Canadian oil as they are shills for the US  and want to keep us ignorant. Latest awful truth from yesterday's interview of a Canadian oil minister on CBC. The US oil companies extract 41/2 million barrels from us a day for LESS than $7 a barrel.

3869 2018-11-26 18:38:17 Took my car into the shop for an oil change and just now noticed my hood was half up and wouldn’t close and they LEFt a POWeR DrILL in my hood???
3870 2018-11-26 18:38:15 In the 70s many scientists and government studies were tell us that we were going to run out of oil in 15 to 20 year. That was a real accurate prediction. Using computer models manipulated by activities will produce any result they want.
3871 2018-11-26 18:38:07 I can’t remember the last time my car got an oil change, whelp that can’t be a good sign
3872 2018-11-26 18:38:06 Love the recruiting sid.... lock me up all day doing ncaa 14.... hard to do working 70 hours a week or more in the used oil industry in Cali AZ and Nevada as an oil broker
3873 2018-11-26 18:37:58 O yea that oil got changed today tho 
3874 2018-11-26 18:37:49 That was a dead cat bounce yesterday.   Still think Bitcoin will test $3000.   You should seriously consider looking into other markets to trade along with crypto.   Oil is a really fun one.  Easier than crypto to TA because there are fewer shenanigans.  I much prefer it.
3875 2018-11-26 18:37:49 I just did follow follow and bought Bobbi brown foundation but turns out it’s “oil free” doesn’t work on me... shudda stuck with my fenty beauty 
3876 2018-11-26 18:37:40 No Cadbury anything until you stop using palm oil.
3877 2018-11-26 18:37:40 Very fun. That's why I think I do abstracts. I just gotta go where the oil pastels take me. It's straight emotion on a page
3878 2018-11-26 18:37:38 A handful. Not 'many.' And they're very, very often linked back to oil company funding or similar when you dig deeper.
3879 2018-11-26 18:37:38 Really? Cause that's the part i was unsure of.

The first part is just because he's head of state(more or less) but the "taxes fuel like Macron," is in reference to an oil and natural gas tax hike that a lot of people were protesting over the weekend.
3880 2018-11-26 18:37:32 Yeah GroupOn, I bought some amusement park tickets last year so I want 18 Black Friday e-mails about oil changes in Toledo.  I do not fear our AI overlords.
3881 2018-11-26 18:37:31 PMB approves the long overdue improved salary structure for the Nigerian Police. What PDP could not do in an oil boom. Sai baba!!!
3882 2018-11-26 18:37:29 Waiting on an oil change. Listening to the salesmen figure out how to put up a huge Christmas tree. Hoping for an answer to the age-old question: how many car salesmen does it take to put up a Christmas tree?
3883 2018-11-26 18:37:26 Hey @enterprisecares My current rental leaked oil all over my garage floor. The vehicle was swapped out to be taken to a repair shop, but now I’m left with oil everywhere! Huge hassle for something that’s not my fault..
3884 2018-11-26 18:37:25 Thanks for screwing your best friends to the north. When the USA comes calling for help no if but when they need help in different regions to fight terror. Forget it go it alone. We are going back to peace keeping. We will produce our own oil and forget our wood to rebuild storms
3885 2018-11-26 18:37:14 Y’all really just buy oils from anyone? Someone is selling carrot oil you’re buying and you don’t even know how it was made. Someone is selling cream you’re buying. Tufiakwa

3889 2018-11-26 18:36:49 An evening walk down Dalal Street | Indices off to a flying start; Sensex up 373 pts; HUL up 5%: Recovery in prices of crude oil too failed…
3890 2018-11-26 18:36:48 LMAOOOOO. I'm hearing that someone was looking for me specifically at work the other day after I made the sweet potatoes for comida. I mean all I did was wash them, halve them, and toss em in salt and oil. Thanks fam, thanks.
3891 2018-11-26 18:36:44 Trump really out here bringing down oil prices smh
3892 2018-11-26 18:36:36 remembering about the time that i almost set my house on fire because i forgot to turn off the gas on the pot of oil
3893 2018-11-26 18:36:35 Over $1700 off sticker is good start, but I'm going to want top dollar for my trade and free oil changes for a year, and oh yeah, a bare foot gas pedal installed before this negotiation goes any further.
3894 2018-11-26 18:36:25 Street harassment in Hastings: oi stop bruv I gotta knife
Street harassment in York: ya need some oil on yer brakes love
3895 2018-11-26 18:36:24 Who is this that blocked me
3896 2018-11-26 18:36:12 I don’t get it, we want to push these companies toward electric and energy effiecent vehicles, but when they do it on their own they are seen as greedy. To reduce our oil consumption we need to eventually cut jobs associated with them...
3897 2018-11-26 18:36:10 Yup it was Saddam who flew plane into the WTC (not)
Yup it was Saddam who had WMDs (not)
What he did have was the temerity to suggest that he wanted payment for oil in Euros not Dollars.
3898 2018-11-26 18:36:07 Nom! Polish rice.  Ingredients: evaporated milk, raisin, coca-cola, oil, tomato paste, and vinegar.
3899 2018-11-26 18:36:00 Absolutely! My wife and I actually put thieves oil vitality in a vegetable capsule and take it as a pill to boost immune system health. But, you can put it on your feet too 
3900 2018-11-26 18:36:00 With the world moving away from oil to green energy in 2034 which is 15 years away. What is his plan on this? No candidate for 2019 election has provided any plan on this. With the dwindling oil revenue, how will he boost the tax efficiency than what @MBuhari is doing?
3901 2018-11-26 18:35:56 My home that depends on oil for heat & hot water thanks you! $2.89 per gallon makes for an expensive winter!
3902 2018-11-26 18:35:49 $25 oil change bring your own shit to the shop 5 points west all day
3903 2018-11-26 18:35:46 Not to my knowledge as deepwater economics lead operators to focus on oil, not gas development. Shallow water gas broadly speaking is not competitive with shale. There have been discussions of offshore export terminals, but I believe that would be sourced from onshore gas.
3904 2018-11-26 18:35:44 And he isn't driven by tge money he recieves from big oil and car companies?
3905 2018-11-26 18:35:44 Each ton of recycled paper can save 17 trees, 380 gallons of oil, 3 cubic yards of landfill, 4000 kilowatts of energy and 7000 gallons of water. Andrew Y
3906 2018-11-26 18:35:40 Just got the oil changed in my wife's car, which we purchased used 6 months ago, we've already dropped almost $1k to fix the AC, now we need another $2k worth of repairs because it has never been serviced according to Ford, and it has 124k (about 6k by us) miles on it. NOT GOOD!
3907 2018-11-26 18:35:39 Omg I put some skin oil on my cat and she’s so mad at me now. She legit wants nothing to do with me but she’s on my bed
3908 2018-11-26 18:35:39 Actually it’s the climate change deniers who are paid by the oil & coal industries, since any real scientist knows that it’s true

3911 2018-11-26 18:35:22 Love the oil sands and Ft Mac. Their operations are clean and the envy of other industries.  Plus there’s so much proven reserves.  A storehouse of future wealth for our country and province!
3912 2018-11-26 18:35:21 PMB approves the long overdue improved salary structure for the Nigerian Police. What PDP could not do in an oil boom. Sai baba!!!
3913 2018-11-26 18:35:17 I sometimes question why one can’t build things like foundries to produce steel like the oil ref., I wouldn’t complain if it were titled “Iron”, which I’d just write it off as a resource that cannot be be just made, but it’s named “Steel” which makes me think, build a foundry.
3914 2018-11-26 18:35:17 I told you to oil that shit down but don’t listen!
3915 2018-11-26 18:35:12 Ill get my oil change tomorrow morning
3916 2018-11-26 18:35:10 in 2014, unionists did theyre damndest to hide an oil field that was discovered in 1977?   

have a word with yourself son
3917 2018-11-26 18:35:07 Tom Delay wrong! Yes we have had devastating storms, in the past,  not as frequently as they are now! I think we can assume that he hasn’t done research for years on end about this subject and I don’t think that he has a degree in Environmental science! Texas oil man! All about $
3918 2018-11-26 18:35:05 The biggest lie was the 2014 white paper and the snp boasting Scotland was one of the "richest countries in the world", and promising 7.8bn in oil revenues.

It was zero
3919 2018-11-26 18:35:05 What About the GOP denial of #ClimateChange aided by billion$$ campaign contributions from the Big Oil companies?????
3920 2018-11-26 18:35:05 We could send 5000 peacemakers/social workers/troops whoever is needed to clear up whatever it is they’re running from in Central America too. Oh wait. No oil there.
3921 2018-11-26 18:34:53 Quite simplistically, when there is an oil spill the EPA focuses on the dirty water around the cause of the spill.  You’re the cause oil spill and those staffers are far from your contaminated, crooked circle!
3922 2018-11-26 18:34:52 Ironically, religious fanatics make the same mistake (with regards to blasphemy law in Pakistan). It’s a man made law not Islamic/religious law.
3923 2018-11-26 18:34:50 Bones don’t turn to oil.
3924 2018-11-26 18:34:50 Each day, all the Electric Vehicles on the planet displace just two minutes  worth of global oil production. (Also, whether for virtue signaling or  health benefits, the two millennial enthusiasms, bicycling and electric scooters, displace even less oil.)
3925 2018-11-26 18:34:37 @CNN really? You bring on Tom Delay to talk about climate change? This guy is a corrupt moron that has always been bought and paid for by the oil industry. Let's not give these assholes a platform.

3927 2018-11-26 18:34:33 Trump has no say or control over GM.  Just like the price of oil is outta his control.  Anyone that believes a word trump says deserves to be disappointed

3929 2018-11-26 18:34:20 I use CBD oil or paste for my daughter's IBS. Her stomach & bowel are hypersensitive. 8 years of daily pain & constant accidents & the consultant was useless. Since I started her on CBD no pain & rarely an accident.

3931 2018-11-26 18:34:18 It is really to bad that the people of Ohio believed his snake oil salesman pitch during his campaign and voted him President, along with other duped states.
Everything effectively happening right now to all Americans is his fault.
AND HE COULD CARE LESS!
3932 2018-11-26 18:34:12 This helps him get to his "Paris commitments": close down all manufacturing, mining, & the oil sector and we will be"hitting targets"
3933 2018-11-26 18:34:04 When will you stop using dirty palm oil? Until then I’m boycotting all products that U mfr. 2 bad U put $ ahead of the planet
3934 2018-11-26 18:34:00 334
3935 2018-11-26 18:33:54 This is true. Saw a Burger King commercial filmed once in my town and I saw them use Elmer glue for mayo on a Whopper. And some kind of oil for the burger juice.
3936 2018-11-26 18:33:54 we have so much tarsands oil, no? 
3937 2018-11-26 18:33:52 Orange oil
3938 2018-11-26 18:33:39 Industrial diesel oil, fuel oil and diesel. FO is cheaper than IDO and does same work.....fire furnaces, boilers but both are very dirty.
3939 2018-11-26 18:33:34 The truth. The scientific research industry which relies heavily on public funding is just as much a corrupt big business as the oil industry, at least the oil industry doesn’t lie about what they want.
3940 2018-11-26 18:33:27 Why would anyone believe @realDonaldTrump ? Carnival barker and snake oil peddler. Remove the Conman
3941 2018-11-26 18:32:58 These mentally lazy people cannot reason the way you want them to, they just gather their data from opinion twisters on the internet and regurgitate them like choristers in a church.

Even market women know Nigeria’s economic trajectory has always flowed along crude oil prices
3942 2018-11-26 18:32:57 GOP leaders claiming scientists can't be trusted because they have some sort of "alternative incentive" while Trump shrugs off a journalist being butchered because of our relationship with Saudi Arabian Oil...

...At least our gas is 50 cents cheaper now?
3943 2018-11-26 18:32:50 Why are people still calling for palm oil boycotts when its established that it has lower environmental impact that other oils.
3944 2018-11-26 18:32:39 I can’t ever just get a normal routine oil change they always calling me with some other expensive ass shit 
3945 2018-11-26 18:32:12 Aye @NeterGold I just got that infused oil power pic at work. My beard and hair thank you for the superior packaging and quick delivery. 
3946 2018-11-26 18:32:05 Lol..... yes because there's so much money in scientific research as opposed to.... oil
3947 2018-11-26 18:32:03 But 100,000 oil workers laid off in Alberta: "crickets"!
3948 2018-11-26 18:32:01 No doubt at all on that. Trumpism is partly our own fault. We abandoned them then wonder why they turned to a snake oil salesman.
3949 2018-11-26 18:31:57 كيف له ان يتحدث مع سيدة رقيقة بهذه الطريقه؟!
3950 2018-11-26 18:31:50 Are they sure that this chicken didn't just put on some black face by rolling around in an oil spill.
3951 2018-11-26 18:31:50 So today is the day everyone gets an oil change huh
3952 2018-11-26 18:31:46 Protein, wireless headphones and fish oil for $50 dollars 
3953 2018-11-26 18:31:42 Oil cannot rebound in a short time frame. OPEC can't deliver a synchronized supply cuts. Russia is convinced with 70$. Arabia convinced with what makes trump convinced.
3954 2018-11-26 18:31:27 Cbd oil has helped me
3955 2018-11-26 18:31:26 @mattklewis do you believe milk is an oil?
3956 2018-11-26 18:31:24 I don’t know, but we need to keep oil in the ground. Either that or we continuing destroying planet. Money or Life, depends which is more important to @ScotGovClimate

3959 2018-11-26 18:31:17 Things you didn't know about Florida: Many States are supposedly controlled by 'Big Oil'. Down here we got 'Big Sugar'!  Truth!
3960 2018-11-26 18:31:06 Combine above w/report on this:
List all oil drilling/fracking sites since 50's
How long did they last, or how much longer will they last?
Fracking=when ground crude gets sparse=get every last drop.
How long is that? Longevity of current & projected sites?
Oil dependency=calamity
3961 2018-11-26 18:31:04 opa podexá, protetor eu uso um oil free, mas sei lá, não parece tão bom ashdiuaddas
3962 2018-11-26 18:31:00 Fracking for oil isn't a long term solution, the well depletion rates are huge. As for conventional wells, most of the easy oil is tapped, vast reserves deep water in harsh climates.
3963 2018-11-26 18:30:48 ‘Data is the new Oil’ - how can I not have heard this before?!  #BIM4FM @bimacademy
3964 2018-11-26 18:30:39 My rental ran out of oil Friday and I was there immediately pouring in 5 gallons of diesel at a time to get us by until today’s delivery. All part of the fun
3965 2018-11-26 18:30:37 Hey @tomdelay let's compare how much scientists who support climate change get paid with how much your oil buddies are making. Remind me who has a vested interest in climate change debate? @brikeilarcnn keeping him honest. No dissenting opinion because it's #TRUTH. #FactsMatter

3969 2018-11-26 18:30:32 The US owns about 85% of our corporations including all the oil companies and refineries. Their profits from extracting our oil alone is around 370 billion yearly. NOT FAKE FACTS. With gluttonist right wing  billionaires running America and thus our economy don't expect fairness.

3979 2018-11-26 18:29:27 Any Canadian politician that does not call out these foreign saboteurs of our economic lifeblood should be relegated to the dustbin of history.What we have in the Langevin Block calling the shots against the oil industry is a supporter of these saboteurs&traitors:’WWF’ Butts
3980 2018-11-26 18:29:20 Simple answer: oil companies dumped $30M into the “no” campaign.
3981 2018-11-26 18:29:17 I randomly found a jar of horse oil I bought forever ago and decided to use it on my face at night and omg my face is so soft 
3982 2018-11-26 18:29:12 My brother has a 2007 Chevy Silverado still running at 310,000 miles. Regular oil changes and routine maintenance can go a long way. Only things replaced were wheel bearings, which will go out with that many miles, regardless the maker.
3983 2018-11-26 18:29:08 Typically conservative clown that denies climate change...i'm betting his portfolio is mostly in oil!!
3984 2018-11-26 18:28:55 Hurricanes, oil spills and now this. Hasn't the Coast suffered enough?
3985 2018-11-26 18:28:45 i still dont get the point of canned tuna in oil, is there people who actually eat it just like that?
3986 2018-11-26 18:28:45 You do realize thank the minerals to make electric cars need to be mined.  Cobalt can be found in the DRC and in Canada’s north.  Graphite and lithium are not ‘Green’ minerals either.  Let’s not forget the tires come from oil, and the aluminum and steel production is not clean.
3987 2018-11-26 18:28:42 I do.

I personally thinks natgas just lags oil a couple months and am bearish at current price point for both, but still waiting for that rebound in oil before shorting again
4000 2018-11-26 18:27:56 Even if you support nationalization broadly, we aren't talking about about a commodity like oil or lumber. Its an industry with huge start up and lag time from design to production, not to mention how heavily the industry is branding and reputation dependent...

4007 2018-11-26 18:26:59 I’m always in tears when I get to the “Who said sumn about oil? bitch you cookin?” part of Dave Chappell’s black president bush skit
4008 2018-11-26 18:26:55 Coal mining quite literally displaces entire mountains. The science on fracking is inconclusive at best. Where to start on oil pollution? Don’t get me wrong they are heavily regulated, but here in AR we are losing farm permitting to bad science and no one seems to care.
4009 2018-11-26 18:26:37 Yep, palm oil itself isn't inherently bad as a source of biofuel or cooking oil, as its quite energy dense and efficient at producing oil. But right now there are few effective mechanism to ensure that production occurs in responsible ways, and not in peat swamp rainforests.
4010 2018-11-26 18:26:35 @JustinTrudeau  you have time to fix the oil patch supply issues now.  It’s too late for GM and it’s Impalas.  Recognize that the West deserves your attention.  Now!!!!

Why can't we utilize our reserves & spend it on us, ppl of bslochiatans! Gulf only utilized oil & thy r successful
4013 2018-11-26 18:26:28 I hope you are right!
4014 2018-11-26 18:26:27 do you think if we sent more journalists for the saudis to hack up we'll get even cheaper oil?

4030 2018-11-26 18:25:19 The predictions are that oil demand will be on the increase for the next 25 yrs & the Trudeau government isn't even thinking about what that means for our oil industry. But import oil from the Saudis we keep doing. INSANE

4033 2018-11-26 18:24:59 As well why can the oil companies not set the price they sell their product for? Or just to keep selling the Canadian company sets it lower themselves?

4035 2018-11-26 18:24:51 Brylan filled up my car, changed my oil, and left me $20 for lunch.. #blessed
4036 2018-11-26 18:24:46 All it took to get oil prices down was the destruction of one human life. Way to go Mr So-called President!!!!
4037 2018-11-26 18:24:46 You know in Alaska everybody gets a litte cut of the oil $ thats pulled from their state. How is you giving back stolen water a bold thing?
4038 2018-11-26 18:24:42 First it has to be food, this looks like an oil field in Iraq
4039 2018-11-26 18:24:40 ok gotta eat my tuna sandwich today, lets see the cans i bought just this morning

4040 2018-11-26 18:24:40 Agree, seeing many Chevron and other Big Oil ad placements alongside climate change articles. Ugh!

4042 2018-11-26 18:24:35 Yo Kville you got a tent with 1 sleeping bag for me and Jockitch Dakich. We like to snuggle together when we record our ANTI-Duke podcast. Students come visit us and watch him rub my scaly scalp with hot oil before the Indiana game.  #kville #dukenation #hoosier #MackBrown

4044 2018-11-26 18:24:23 So I baptized a baby yesterday that was chubby, covered in oil and throwing a fit. I can’t wait until she grows up so I can tell her about how many times I almost dropped her on the floor.

4047 2018-11-26 18:24:10 The American Enterprise Institute is funded by Big Oil. @dpletka is nothing more than an especially odious lobbyist.
4048 2018-11-26 18:24:09 Why are we supposed to thank you? You don't control the price of oil. Or is this MSB thanking you for covering up the Khashoggi assasination?

4050 2018-11-26 18:24:03 Loki is 100% correct. If we wanted to protect our own oil Industries then we needed to build our own refineries at least a couple decades ago. In 1974 the Fed started allowing private banks to take interest in loans to provincial governments and municipalities that previous went
4051 2018-11-26 18:23:52 dang, understandable. i spent $20 on my last oil change. thank you coupons!

4054 2018-11-26 18:23:42 I swear I get my oil change every month because my car goes by mi  maybe I’m tripping
4055 2018-11-26 18:23:39 Idk why but I have this belief that it would be easier to convince a man who took no corporate money to push for a new green deal than the men in bed with the party of oil
4056 2018-11-26 18:23:32 Amla oil , it’s the best oil I ever tried
4057 2018-11-26 18:23:20 What? My piece isn’t mixed media. It is oil on canvas.
4058 2018-11-26 18:23:07 There is a great power in our thoughts and our ability to think deeply

Just think about how did some figure out they can refine Gold, crude oil, etc into something very desirable and Valuable.
4059 2018-11-26 18:22:58 Albertans want to think of themselves as producers of cheap oil. I get it. It's just not the case.
4060 2018-11-26 18:22:56 Agriculture, Oil & Gas, Tech, auto @JustinTrudeau @liberal_party can you please explain to me how we are still a competitive and attractive international business marketplace? Increasing taxes the people to make up for the shortfall of losing business.
4061 2018-11-26 18:22:55 Yo my oil change is gonna take an hr 
4062 2018-11-26 18:22:53 Companies will move to best jurisdictions for business.  This government is ruining competitiveness and doesn’t seem to understand. Goodbye Autos, Goodbye Oil, goodbye...
4063 2018-11-26 18:22:47 That’s funny every idiotic conservative in North America is taking Claim to lower oil prices. You know that gas prices are down everywhere right? Maybe you’re just that annoying person that points out that it’s snowing.
4064 2018-11-26 18:22:42 Commodities are headed lower along with oil as China stares at a recession!!! These companies will see margins erode sharply in next 12 months!!
4065 2018-11-26 18:22:39 Big oil will be hard to defeat! They have all the money
4066 2018-11-26 18:22:39 Daily question at Fed/Treasury Plunge Protection Team:
"How can we keep the price of gold, silver, & oil suppressed while keeping bond & stock prices high, while maintaining a strong dollar?"

4071 2018-11-26 18:22:21 i was supposed to get an oil change in October
4072 2018-11-26 18:22:01 I wish gas stations still had guys who pumped your gas, checked your oil & cleaned your windows- What happened to that?
4073 2018-11-26 18:22:01 I hope you get better support than the oil workers did in Alberta.  That is guaranteed poor easterners
4074 2018-11-26 18:21:58 Guy being a jerk to the worker at the oil change place, when the worker asked if he'd been helped yet. Guy had been inside for a only a few seconds. If you're such a manly man, in such a terrible hurry, why don't you go change your own oil? Or just be polite to these workers?!
4075 2018-11-26 18:21:57 That's not what I mean. how in employment due to social EU rules ,people have to pay for yearly courses to keep the jobs they already have. Amount of food in mountainous heaps wasted. Fishing life styles ruined. Mining due Thatcher seeing easy to import. Oil of coast not mined
4076 2018-11-26 18:21:57 Is the oil leak sorted just looking at mot mate looks tidy 
4077 2018-11-26 18:21:55 Sweet girl are you able to use cbd oil? It truly helps..I promise

#Sweetlady is sharing her experience as a sex worker and she's saying religious leaders are some of her clients. Sometimes they pay with basic commodities like cooking oil and sugar.

4090 2018-11-26 18:20:58 I needed my oil changed so my dad did it while I was sleep, got my tires rotated, a new battery, made me some groceries and filled my truck up with gas. I ain’t settling for SHAT 
4091 2018-11-26 18:20:49 There is some wild drama going on within the company that fills up our oil tank

4093 2018-11-26 18:20:40 We have to sit back & watch unless fans are willing to pressure the sale of the club to a oil rich country.

4096 2018-11-26 18:20:16 this dude from one county over strangled his family & buried them in an oil field & now someone is selling his underwear on craigslist for $500
4097 2018-11-26 18:20:16 I agree with our well-heeled friend, but one of the darkest clouds that accompanies cheap oil prices is the profligate use of oil, and the preference for SUVs, and trucks. Exercise more and eat less is an axiom for many things.
4098 2018-11-26 18:20:11 Science is verified through peer review. If something in the process was wrong, then someone will call them out on their shit. That's why it's trusted more than politicians like Marco Rubio who receive millions from the oil industry to deny climate change.
4099 2018-11-26 18:19:56 Its hillarious to witness literally every politician throughout the world try to take credit for low oil & gas prices. @fordnation is just another in a long list of opportunist politicans who hope you dont know any better. #onpoli
4100 2018-11-26 18:19:52 Trump and Putin share the same ideology in regards to sovereign territory.  Trumps takes land from the nation’s first people-
Putin took Crimea, Ukraine’s next.

If only Ukraine had oil or gold, uranium, anything worthy of Trumps attention to divert from his golf game.

4145 2018-11-26 18:15:22 Oil prices WERE BETTER UNDER PRESIDENT OBAMA, before you took office, GAS WAS UNDER $2 a gallon, now we pay almost $3 a gallon, if you drove you would know this.  TRUMP IS BAD FOR BUSINESS and BAD FOR THE USA.

4153 2018-11-26 18:14:36 Turkey needs to be grilled whit more oil
4154 2018-11-26 18:14:34 That is the result of predicting and preparing. These moves are well calculated, based on propabilities and scenarios similar to what Shell did prior to Oil crisis.

That makes it super scary. It basically means that GM doesn’t believe there’s a quick or an easy way out of this.
4155 2018-11-26 18:14:27 Bad idea putting baby oil on before putting on skinny jeans 
4156 2018-11-26 18:14:27 @KBonakerDAA  Hi Karen Bonaker, Watched your Painter Essentials 6 Auto Painting tips.  A excellent tutorial video. I have a question, using Auto-Paint with oil painting,modern painting,detailed painting. It finishes with a jagged/circular border. Can I undo it before it starts.

4163 2018-11-26 18:13:52 Our oil prices are low because we can only export it to one market.

4171 2018-11-26 18:13:29 Many socialist governments were elected in the 90s & 2000s which has been called the "pink tide." After the US removed some of its influence the countries were left impoverished and oil and natural resources were nationalized to protect wealth from US buying it up
4172 2018-11-26 18:13:23 @RachelNotley @joececiyyc Average combined oil price of all Alberta oil is now $32.  15 Billion dollar NDP 2018 Deficit likely!! Nice job with your Green initiatives. Thanks @JustinTrudeau for destroying Alberta too
4173 2018-11-26 18:13:19 Hmmm Avacado oil does both...no additives, chemicals...and althiugh oily when applied, it soaks in quickly leaving soft skin. #skincare @MahrieGReid
4174 2018-11-26 18:13:10 Use olive oil as carrier oil
4175 2018-11-26 18:13:06 When are you going to publically thank all Canadians for keeping our oil price so low for the 40% of the total you get from nations?
4176 2018-11-26 18:12:58 リクエストは受け付けないぜ！
4177 2018-11-26 18:12:55 It helps with that. But are you moisturizing? A lot of the time, skin starts overproducing oil when it’s not getting enough

4180 2018-11-26 18:12:50 Meet the Press is helping to spread oil industry FUD (The Fear Uncertainty Doubt—“well there is science but there’s also not science”) Big oil and big tobacco have done that forever. For tobacco lung cancer was the consequence.  For big oil, it’s extinction.

4187 2018-11-26 18:11:58 Oil that leaked from the Deepwater Horizon disaster was never removed from the Gulf. Instead it sank further beneath the surface, affecting the temperature of the water. This may explain why Michael went from a tropical storm to a Cat 5 in three days. Then there is the plastic...

4191 2018-11-26 18:11:28 I missed Nitti! I got there at 11 because I drove in from Austin after a wedding. Also, I feel like we probably saw each other at one point, I was running around that whole right area giving people peppermint oil (for ~energy~) because I spilled my whole bottle on my hands 
4192 2018-11-26 18:11:26 Women of African descent- Stop putting coconut oil in your hair. Its causing it to become dry,  brittle, and it will break off.
4193 2018-11-26 18:11:24 Finally got this damn oil change

4201 2018-11-26 18:10:40 I've heard Canada has a lot of laws that prevent doing that in Canadian commercials - no glue as "milk" in cereal, no shaving foam or motor oil, etc. Presumably you could still use the ramekin, though.
4202 2018-11-26 18:10:39 I need to get an oil change and I’m dreading it.
4203 2018-11-26 18:10:37 lmfao youre sat under the greediest Conservative goverment ever ,if there was a mountain oil in Scotland they would have used it by now .You are quite clearly one of the most gullible people ive ever met 
4204 2018-11-26 18:10:35 @elonmusk how about creating a super powerful solar panel. In theory 1 square foot of sun light equals 1,000,000 barrels of oil. Tesla can change the tides on energy consumption by harnessing that power.
4205 2018-11-26 18:10:29 There is a point of diminishing returns at which Normals start going elsewhere. FB is already dying. I suspect Twitter is next. You’re Standard Oil Of Ohio until you’re Not.
4206 2018-11-26 18:10:25 I had 2 great oil trades today.. oil has become my new friend..  this month alone nearly 10k

4215 2018-11-26 18:09:57 Unfortunately you have to depend on nature to cooperate and you cant build enough wind and solar sources to do away with oil.

4219 2018-11-26 18:09:35 My goodness, if any of my relatives did that we would have words!
Fortunately my relatives include the world's top population geneticist, so we know those companies are sell snake oil. Plus we're Jews, so we have a healthy fear of what's down this particular slippery slope.
4220 2018-11-26 18:09:34 @realDonaldTrump Time to bust up the monopolies of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and google like Roosevelt did with JP Morgan  and Standard Oil.
4221 2018-11-26 18:09:31 Buying is not bullying. Do you think oil was stolen?

4227 2018-11-26 18:08:59 As the son of a scientist, I can attest: if you want to make bank doing science... you do it for private, for profit companies... like oil companies and lobbying groups! In academia you can make a decent living, but it takes YEARS to work up to that!

Gosh I wonder if it could be DIGGING UP & COMBUSTING FOSSIL CARBON (COAL-OIL-GAS), WHICH ADDED NEW CARBON TO THE SYSTEM AND CAUSED CO2 TO RISE FROM 285 TO 410 AND COUNTING, AMPING UP THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT RESULTING IN WARMING??

Duh
4238 2018-11-26 18:08:14 @McVities @pladis_global I am 9 and my sister is 6. We enjoy your biscuits a lot but have just found out they have #palmoil in which makes us sad as it hurts orangutans. Is your palm oil sustainable? If not, please, please find a sustainable source. From Reuben and Romy and mum
4239 2018-11-26 18:08:07 I also think that in any system, patterns that self reinforce are the ones that grow. And that has been those institutions and ideas that only work towards securing oil flow
4240 2018-11-26 18:08:03 Without oil and autos we will become a 3rd world country.

4247 2018-11-26 18:07:17 AB still believes that the global oil supply glut of the 80s was caused by the NEP.
4248 2018-11-26 18:07:08 All of that could be dealt with with the remaining oil supply. But there’s that point in a pendulum swing with the forces cancel each other out.
4249 2018-11-26 18:07:01 Yes sir. They purchased 22 drums in total that season, mostly oil ($300/drum), but a few gas as well ($345/drum). So you're looking at $6,600, in a community where >55% earn less than $29,000/yr.
4250 2018-11-26 18:06:57 What upsets me these days is my skin that’s getting worse and my digestion system that isn’t working well. I need to start eating clean again and stuff some fruits down my throat. Too much oil and junks these days

4256 2018-11-26 18:06:39 Global oil consumption is increasing, and projected to continue increasing for another 20 years. Why was it inevitable for us to pivot from that market?
4257 2018-11-26 18:06:26 You use anointing oil in place of lubricant. Indeed that’s Holy sex.

4273 2018-11-26 18:04:46 its heavy oil.  We need to research how to get it out of the ground and process it in less energy intensive ways or it isnt worth doing with oil prices so low.
4274 2018-11-26 18:04:35 I have been checking labels for #PalmOil for ages. I would rather not have palm oil in any products I use/consume, even sustainably sourced...is there a need to put this in chocolate, cleaning products?..even found it in peanut butter, which is oily enough on its own!
4275 2018-11-26 18:04:33 Ummm... How did Harper make out with pipelines?   Maybe industry should have gotten the pioeline going first?  Newfoundland made sure it had tankers ready before first oil...

Some contradiction here as always in this snake oil business.
4282 2018-11-26 18:03:49 It wasn't just oil. All commodity sectors were in a deep recession in 2015. I don't think we can say that was not a demand shock....

4290 2018-11-26 18:03:23 It reminds me of the Betty Crocker (or similar prepackaged cake mix) story, they could make a cake mix that you just add water, but people didn't buy it, but when they made one where you add eggs, oil and water people loved it.

4295 2018-11-26 18:03:08 Did you catch trump’s tweet about oil prices?  Lol. Thank you president T. Nothing quite like being so insecure that you have to publicly thank yourself for things beyond your control that you didn’t do anything to help.
4296 2018-11-26 18:03:05 So far they're not cheaper,storage problems. Daughter has free power in the evenings in TX as they bleed off excess energy. Has to be done bc can't really store it. So right now,very expensive. Yes politicians in oil's pocket. Glut will hit us economically as ND fields shut down.
4297 2018-11-26 18:03:01 Maybe Oshawa will stop smelling like dead cats & burning oil....
4298 2018-11-26 18:03:00 Oil gets some of the same write-offs as other business sectors, but overall, the energy sector is taxed in the US at some of the highest rates in the world.

4303 2018-11-26 18:02:13 Am I wrong?  Who decides what you pay for fuel?  Who decides to run the oil supply as it is?  It’s not the government.  It’s the companies who own the supply. Who do you think stands to profit the most from oil prices?  Brad wall isn’t our premier anymore.
4304 2018-11-26 18:01:56 Yes, fossil fuels were once all we knew.
Now we know better& there is no reasonable argument not to evolve.
Even if you don't care about climate or pollution, fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas) are finite. Consume them long enough and global resources will eventually run out.  FACT
4305 2018-11-26 18:01:53 The real-world exposure offered by apprenticeship-like experience is far more useful than what is imparted in a classroom.
The professors who teach these courses don't need to respect pragmatic realities, because you are paying them for snake oil.
4306 2018-11-26 18:01:47 Depression is 2019!
Hold on to your money! Auto layoffs housing slowing Dallas 1st, Trump Trade War-FAILURE! Russia & China taking over in LatAm (investment 20:1 to USA). World sees USA POWERLESS against Russia & Big Oil as they own Trump. Tax cuts a SCAM.Cheaper oil = Dependence
4307 2018-11-26 18:01:47 Hello !
Ya sama, cuma formulation & cleansing power je berbeza.

Kalau dah pakai micellar water, nak pakai oil cleanser lagi pun boleh, nak skip pun boleh. Ikut tolerance & acceptance kulit awak sendiri :)
4308 2018-11-26 18:01:07 そうそう！最近だとミリシタとか。
4309 2018-11-26 18:00:59 I had a Chevy Suburban and it is literally the worst car on the planet. Oil problems. Rebuild transmission. Engine could go. AC broke. Years and years of repairs and $$ thousands. I stick with my @Toyota.
4310 2018-11-26 18:00:58 Kuzu oil or so. I think it’s a brand of castor oil. It works
4311 2018-11-26 18:00:58 Maybe you should care about the oil industry who still have a chance and within Canada’s control. It doesn’t get money to survive it’s take take take and receive nothing in return. #wakeup

4313 2018-11-26 18:00:48 There are two kinds of wounds to the human psyche. One is sorrow; the other is guilt. Sorrow is a clean wound. Somehow your heart will heal as the Holy Spirit applies His healing balm. He will pour in “the oil of gladness.” 

Time and the grace of God will heal.
4314 2018-11-26 18:00:42 Well done on choosing certified sustainable palm oil, Flavia 
4315 2018-11-26 18:00:42 It's not just cars.  It's not just heating homes.

The computers we use, the medicines that improve our quality of life, the clothes we wear, to almost everything else all comes from oil.

So explain to me what we transition to again?
4316 2018-11-26 18:00:34 The oil prices are “falling” because we ,( Canadians ) , unfortunately sell 40% of our oil to you at  ridiculously   Low prices!
4317 2018-11-26 18:00:28 Warm whiskey in the ear, works like warm oil to soothe pain and disinfects a bit.

4321 2018-11-26 18:00:19 The drop in oil prices is due to the market anticipating a major recession thenaks to President T's stupid trade wars. Also see GM's layoffs of 15% of their employees, once again due to President T's stupid tariffs.....
4322 2018-11-26 18:00:16 Getting an oil change.  I wish someone would pay this for me as a bday gift lol

4324 2018-11-26 18:00:05 Your about as trustworthy as a snake oil salesmen. These people are being targeted by cartels and human traffickers but you are more concerned about a political agenda and the destruction of this country than you are about them!
4325 2018-11-26 18:00:01 Commodities: Gasoline +4.58%, Palm Oil -4.34%
4326 2018-11-26 17:59:59 Cool, I might try the oil next!
4327 2018-11-26 17:59:55 How is he helping OIL & Gas workers in the west?  Not!
4328 2018-11-26 17:59:54 Trump has zero faith in anything but himself. If it wasn’t our country paying the price, it would be laughable that these snake oil salesmen are in the forefront of anything.
4329 2018-11-26 17:59:54 He has no policy. Crap just spews out his fat yap, thinking people will believe his spiel! He claims he gave a tax cut, taking credit for oil prices. He says silent when GM annouces 15% job cuts and closing of upto 5 factories.
4330 2018-11-26 17:59:18 Okay SAME. Not to sound like a crazy person but when I BROKE my foot the doc said it would take 6-8 weeks to heal, but I used lavender oil on it (an expensive one obvs) and my foot healed in like 1 week the doctor thought I did some voodoo shit lmao
4331 2018-11-26 17:59:12 I put peppermint oil over my upper lip because my sinuses are fucked up, and it's tingly as fuck but at least I can breathe again

4334 2018-11-26 17:59:02 Nobody "came" for your dirty oil ..... nobody wants it, and it costs too much to make.  Your metaphoic problem is backwards and insideout, like your underwear right now.
4335 2018-11-26 17:58:46 Doesn't occur to you that if oil prices drop any further it will not be economically viable to drill for it Your base of workers in that industry and all related ones like insurance etc will be out of a job. You're an unmitigated disaster in a cockwomble suit
4336 2018-11-26 17:58:42 So what you are saying is that the liberals are against the oil and gas industry?
4337 2018-11-26 17:58:41 To be completely honest, (not that I approve), if it weren’t for the oil under the Saudi sands, the US would have turned it into glass decades ago just to get rid of the headache. As the oil share dwindles, so does the bargaining power.
4338 2018-11-26 17:58:38 lol. gotta pay bills somehow...better than Rusteez car oil
4339 2018-11-26 17:58:37 don’t let this restock distract you from the fact that @neeshat6 bathes in cologne and drinks a bottle of vegetable oil before linking me
4340 2018-11-26 17:58:15 Breaking News: Free market enthusiast calls for massive government intervention. Nationalizing the oil industry next?
4341 2018-11-26 17:58:14 Cold started it. Blowing oil out exhaust instantly . Thinking cracked ring
4342 2018-11-26 17:58:07 Not that easy. Study succession wars of Mughals. Even existed among Hindu rulers,European rulers. We are up with a big problem. If any vaccum is created ISIS will take over. Then financial market will collapse at least temporarily, because of Oil shock.
4343 2018-11-26 17:58:00 GM is shutting down a car plant in Ontario that does nothing but build cars with internal combustion engines. Trudeau, who publicly says the oil sands need to be shut down somehow not reconcile the relationship with the internal combustion engine as he slams GM for the closure.
4344 2018-11-26 17:57:58 Not only is there oodles of snow on the ground for my drive back to Mt P but there is also something wrong with my oil in my car so I CANT drive back to Mt P! YEET
4345 2018-11-26 17:57:49 Everytime I go to get my oil changed, the receptionist talks about my dad the whole time. It’s astonishing the impact he left behind.
4346 2018-11-26 17:57:49 The panic with this bubble is nothing compared to when either of these 2 things happens first;

1 The dollar is dropped as a trading currency for oil. 
2 hyper-inflation hits in @2030 

You will be on your own during this and I hope I’m wrong.
4347 2018-11-26 17:57:46 Nothing prevents a diversifying of an economy & still keeping a healthy OIL & Gas sector.
4348 2018-11-26 17:57:41 My oil change in my car is taking a lot longer than expected so the stream will be late today guys I’m so sorry. I’m thinking I won’t be on until about 1:30 or so. I’ll keep you updated guys!
4349 2018-11-26 17:57:39 New Premium #OIL Trade Post & Send to Subscribers.
4350 2018-11-26 17:57:39 Solar and wind have fallen in cost by about 80% and 50% in the last decade, so they needed subsidies just a few years ago. Also, everything energy is subsidized (oil gets massive breaks), so some subsidies more-or-less balance the field.
4351 2018-11-26 17:57:36 I absolutely love their Dream Serum and the Ultra Hydrating Oil!
4352 2018-11-26 17:57:35 Well, you're not counting those selling advice on how to profit in certain industries, like real estate. 
But also there's the issue of expecting products to work when they're little more than snake oil.
4353 2018-11-26 17:57:33 @FeastBBQ DO YOU FRY YOUR TOFU IN THE SAME FRYER AND OIL AS YOUR MEAT!?
4354 2018-11-26 17:57:32 You are hurting the oil industry stupid.
4355 2018-11-26 17:57:31 btw , i NEVER use face washes or anything. i only use water and vitamin E oil or coconut oil. trust , it works WONDERS 
4356 2018-11-26 17:57:26 I drive a lot, so naturally I have to get my oil changed like clockwork and this means I go to the dealership a lot, so long story short I think me and one of the guys from the service department are in a relationship now.
4357 2018-11-26 17:57:22 Money from oil corporations to further their political ambitions
4358 2018-11-26 17:57:14 Modern American Capitalism is a direct reflection of our oil consumption, and the American dollar. If you don’t know much about the American dollar, and what we do for oil you probably still like Capitalism.                #Knowledgeispower
4359 2018-11-26 17:57:08 ugh $90 on an oil change 
4360 2018-11-26 17:57:03 Jesus. Did they share the cost of the furnace oil, too?
4361 2018-11-26 17:56:54 You mean the big loss of jobs? Look at what your steel tariffs are doing.  Or do you mean that whopping 11% of oil we get from your Saudi buddies?  No, what you mean is they can murder an American journalist and you won't do a thing because they give YOU money. You're a disgrace.
4362 2018-11-26 17:56:53 Until hot oil/water splashes on you

4364 2018-11-26 17:56:26 2) myoclonic jerking, and stomach problems. However,for the past 3 months i have been ingesting high thc oil and smoking herb and it has helped alot. Symptoms are not gone, but easier to deal with and have gone down. Could be just natural recovery, but THC is helpng me a lot!!
4365 2018-11-26 17:56:25 The Tories treatment #Scotland is appalling always has been happy to grab its oil, redefine borders to suit England & now sell out the #fisherman to keep themselves in power -don't get me started on the poll tax!
4366 2018-11-26 17:56:24 Dw bout it, hopefully loads aloe Vera and tea tree oil for the rest of the week can fix it
4367 2018-11-26 17:56:17 You must be also mad at the money thrown at Toyota $225M and the billions to Bombardier (also massive layoffs and closures announced) not to even mention the dairy farmers.  Haven't yet heard about aluminum and steel workers or of course the oil patch. This by all parties.
4368 2018-11-26 17:56:14 Selling off pristine Federal lands as well.. to the oil fields!
4369 2018-11-26 17:56:00 Maybe its for the better, there's too many cars out. It would be better for more public transportation.  Walk, enjoy the sites, not worrying about getting oil changes that takes 3 or more hours! @Walmart

4376 2018-11-26 17:55:41 Hmm, no help for Alberta oil and gas workers though.

4387 2018-11-26 17:54:30 I sat at the dealer for an hour and a half for a damn oil change wtf!

But somehow the bill came up to be free.......I'm ok with this now
4388 2018-11-26 17:54:29 The younger version of me would appreciate nationalizing GM Canada but older me could probably pass on that as long as it comes with a lifetime pass to tell Albertans to fuck off when they whine about us not doing enough for the oil industry.

4395 2018-11-26 17:54:12 Oil supply exceeding demand is solely responsible for the lowered prices. You have no responsibility for that whatsoever. You are lying yet again. You should resign since you prefer to deliberately misinform the country you swore to protect

High THC cannabis oil and smoking herb did not help with symptoms either, my main symptoms being brain zaps

4416 2018-11-26 17:51:41 I still do not understand how the US military can talk about God when they go to foreign countries that did not do anything to them and spread so much sufferings among families and innocent people .... just for oil and money. 
I don't think we love the same God

4422 2018-11-26 17:51:05 Wonderful post Mike, I've been meaning to ask if you have any background in cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome? I personally believe it's azadirachtin or neem oil toxicity. Just haven't been feeling well and progressively getting worse with the doctors here telling me CHS
4423 2018-11-26 17:51:04 Agree.  Probably when XBT is accepted for oil.  Except China isn't there and their regional allies won't dare move first.  Indonesia?  Rest of Asia depends on US for protection, and BTC for oil is a political non-starter absent some significant event altering political arena.
4424 2018-11-26 17:50:55 What does the oil do

4441 2018-11-26 17:49:36 Yeah we are, with human overpopulation snuffing out their habitat. Its not hunting or hunters affecting their population. Its gas and oil cutting off their migration routes (caribou) and the predators use cut lines to hunt, and overhunt their food sources.
4442 2018-11-26 17:49:33 Evan, you know in campaigns promises made on available info, when Lpc got into govt months passed from budget of 15, and fiscal hole was papered over, and oil prices crashed further, not too mention phoenix savings weren't there either.
4443 2018-11-26 17:49:24 Umm, why hasnt he done this for the oil and gas workers.
4444 2018-11-26 17:49:23 Did you read her tweet! Jesus! “That's the same President who thanked a dictatorship, this morning, for suppressing the price of oil.” Do u not understand how the hell this works? Learn!!!!
4445 2018-11-26 17:49:18 I didn’t know the oil industry needed to transition to digital platforms.
4446 2018-11-26 17:49:12 I couldn't agree more with that statement, maybe we are long lost relatives. I've always said religion will end civilization one day and probably have a lot to do with Islam. Probably all end in the Middle East where most of the oil is located.

4449 2018-11-26 17:48:52 The Saudis are the biggest oil suppliers in the world. What don’t you understand about messing with them. They will crash the entire world economy. But you do know that! #Progressive’s would do that to get their #Socialistic agenda. You are very evil.
4450 2018-11-26 17:48:51 Unless you happen to live in the oil patch, then deflating prices caused by murderous Saudis cranking up production is not great (thank you President T)
4451 2018-11-26 17:48:48 What west of Shetland oil field were you referring to in that article?
4452 2018-11-26 17:48:47 Exactly and oil boilers are extortionate
4453 2018-11-26 17:48:46 あっちのカナダニキはOil tycoonなのかもしれない
4454 2018-11-26 17:48:45 Saudi Arabia has #petrol raised its production to 11.2 million barrels per day. This is the most solid figure since the beginning of the first oil production of the kingdom 80 years ago.
4455 2018-11-26 17:48:45 Want to buy local? Get your govt to build train lines so your travel $$ are spent locally, not sent to faraway oil companies & carmakers

Thank you for asking...
I have practiced kegels all my life!  My grippers are good and strong!

4458 2018-11-26 17:48:29 I prefer to use acrylic paints, as it is a good mix of water colour and   oil paint. I can be more expressive with acrylics, as it is easier to create emotions, by using fast brush movement. Whereas with oils you  can't really let yourself go.  At least not for me.

4460 2018-11-26 17:48:24 Agreed. Fuck oil. Stop subsidizing it. Glad we agree.
4461 2018-11-26 17:48:20 Do I know that calling clear lip gloss “lip oil” is a cheap marketing ploy? Yes. Am I gonna buy some? YES
4462 2018-11-26 17:48:16 @realDonaldTrump I have no more words, hopefully, and hopefully, by March, Iran's oil exports will reach zero, zero, zero, zero. I hope I can rest a bit, I struggled more than anyone else in these two years and I never had rest, I hope some officials know how hard we worked
4463 2018-11-26 17:48:05 Oil needn't rule the world. Has been losing clout steadily as better, steadily cheaper renewable options arrive. We could be reducing dependency now, dramatically, if DJT and a Congressional majority weren't in oil's pockets.
4464 2018-11-26 17:47:57 I lived in Paradise in the 90’s and worked in the North State for 20 years in Chico and beyond as a territory rep for Major oil companies. I have been enjoying Sierra Nevada since the early 80’s. My sons and I went straight out to get a 24 of celebration and Fall, and Snow pack.
4465 2018-11-26 17:47:47 Axe oil ftw
4466 2018-11-26 17:47:45 I use Basil daily to support my adrenals. It’s a beautiful Oil in my collection. Are you familiar with Basil? 
4467 2018-11-26 17:47:31 #Trump has the absolute nerve to take personal credit for low oil prices. He implied he personally asked the Saudis to lower the price of oil. He must think Americans are as stupid as he is. Sad.
4468 2018-11-26 17:47:28 I'd rather have cannabis oil than dangerous chemotherapy.
4469 2018-11-26 17:47:23 Oil prices rose, recovering some of the previous session’s near-7 percent fall, although uncertainty over global economic growth limited the gains.
4470 2018-11-26 17:47:22 I really need to find a better place to get my oil changes. Been waiting in @Walmart  for 3 hours!  I was told half that. #fml
4471 2018-11-26 17:47:20 My partner has had chronic back and leg pain for over a year. Yesterday she tried cbd oil from @holland_barrett for the first time. Virtually pain free after the 1st hour. Early days but still good today. Worth a try at less than £10 a bottle
4472 2018-11-26 17:47:17 To clarify. The dollars imported are owned by the oil supplier.
The currency matters less than the ownership of the currency of course.
4473 2018-11-26 17:47:15 Auto sector took bailouts, pays ceo high bonuses, gm is not a Canadian company. They stole tax payer funds never repaying it. Ford repayed the bailout funds. Oil industry is the richest industry what bail out would you like? Bombardier is a Canadian staple. Slow news day?
4474 2018-11-26 17:46:51 Low oil prices destroy the Russian economy, has to be linked ?
4475 2018-11-26 17:46:41 yes and even then, it's not cheap.. now the cheapest bottle of oil is like 88$ while quinn and argyle was 40$ for me, thats the double the price for not even more products inside
4476 2018-11-26 17:46:36 @TiresPlus 4 tires and an oil change. I waited 3 hrs for it to be done.  What's the point in making an appt if something so minor as this takes 3 hrs. I won't be returning to the finneytown Ohio location and possibly none of them.

4484 2018-11-26 17:45:59 Remember when Hextal was hired and he was ripping the Oilers? Saying he will build a winning team without being like the Oil and getting a bunch of high draft picks and taking the easy way. He ended up getting some high picks himself, did not build a winner and now got turfed.
4485 2018-11-26 17:45:53 Platitudes from #Trudeau. Surprise surprise! Oil and gas destroyed under his disastrous reign. Now it looks like manufacturing is next. Our economy is burning from this woeful government #election2019 #rejecttrudeau

4493 2018-11-26 17:45:21 Vote for me and I’ll intrench your economy even more into the oil industry ensuring decades more of boom/bust cycles while ignoring the world wide evolution to renewable energy...

4497 2018-11-26 17:44:38 Better tell Trudeau and Notley to shut down all that new Texas Permian tight oil production. While they're at it they can stop Trump from blackmailing Saudi Arabia into production increases which are depressing world prices.

4507 2018-11-26 17:43:30 Obviously you do not know that 40% of your oil comes from Canada and that as kind neighbours we do give you a low price.
4508 2018-11-26 17:43:27 All the damn time. A wig cap helps slightly because it acts as a buffer for the friction. But only slightly. I just castor oil my scalp every other day irrespective. Prevention is better than cure.

If you’re feeling spicy you can use tea tree oil topically on your pimples, it’s a good antibacterial
Get sunscreen with salicylic acid and put sunscreen on your face first
4514 2018-11-26 17:42:51 Popular resentment of the foreign oil companies was also evident and expressed in several ways. Rufino Blanco Fombona, a Venezuelan writer and politician, accounts for the conflict between Venezuelan workers and their foreign bosses in his 1927 novel, La Bella y la Fiera:
4515 2018-11-26 17:42:46 Bhakths are taking credit for reudciton of fuel prices but Petrol price is reduced by 11% and Diesel price is by 8% compared to October beginning but crude oil reduced by almost 30%. Enough of looting.
4516 2018-11-26 17:42:45 Have you educated yourself on the fuel oil pricing or do you blindly think your union is helping you! Don’t blame Trump for your union screwing you with high prices!!  Looks like a union kickback!!

4534 2018-11-26 17:41:15 Wow! My dad is currently 77 years of age. He still goes out ballroom dancing with mom, still designs on his computer and does own oil changes and tune-ups.
4535 2018-11-26 17:41:15 Calm down, open secrets includes employees of the industry. Oil and Gas are the largest employers in Texas. Even most green energy is owned by oil and gas in Texas. So without a more accurate breakdown this info is deceptive.

4539 2018-11-26 17:40:54 Yes i was thinking more along the lines of things like oil, natural gas, coal. To me a resource is something (an object) we can use to serve a functional purpose. Oil makes cars work. Time and labor didnt really fit into my view of it
4540 2018-11-26 17:40:44 We can build the pipeline ourselves!
We can build cars ourselves!
We just can't figure out how to pay Federal employees...

Wouldn't it be neat to build cars and pipelines, while screaming to high heaven not to buy cars or use oil? 
That'd be a fascinating marketing challenge. 
4541 2018-11-26 17:40:37 Do you understand that Scotland is the only country in the world which is Governed by another country, 400 miles away? A country which takes ALL our wealth, Oil, Gas, Food & Drinks Exports - Gives us pocket money to run the country and THEN tells us, we're subsidised by England?
4542 2018-11-26 17:40:34 But oil companies aren't in denial at all. They know they have known for years the CO2 is warming the earth. And all the while funding a successful misinformation campaign. The profit is just worth more to them than future habitability of the Earth.
4543 2018-11-26 17:40:20 No no no! Just like we have our own oil pipeline now? Government has no clue how to actually run a business.
4544 2018-11-26 17:40:17 It's amazing how this snake oil salesman convinced these imbeciles to vote for him i.e. vote against their own interests & well being!

4560 2018-11-26 17:39:03 Was it a Scottish company that found the oil was it the Scottish government that subsidised it ?

1) Drinks oil
2) Disappears mysteriously at night
3) Returns home at dawn followed by reports of UFO sightings
4) Drives on four wheels
5) Comes from outer space

He's a keeper, and a Transformer alien robot.
4563 2018-11-26 17:38:59 So why are you not equally concerned ani taking action to help out the oil and gas industry.
Guess Alberta does not count for the federal government.

4572 2018-11-26 17:38:12 Anything they plan on coming up with should include spending days on oil rigs in Eket & PH respectively, we’ll be fine.

4575 2018-11-26 17:37:53 That's what they are looking for, the Oil..
4576 2018-11-26 17:37:52 Western states are working together to depress the price of oil. They figure it harms Russia, Iran, and Venezuela more than themselves.
4577 2018-11-26 17:37:47 coconut oil pulling feels so weird
4578 2018-11-26 17:37:42 Oil surges following last week's steep selloff that many felt was overdone
4579 2018-11-26 17:37:42 @ACraftBeerLover I am sick of the whining & crying over the auto industry layoffs- what the HELL about the families in the west in the oil sector. ?? FFS I thought Bev Thompson was going to break down.  She was talking like she was in shock & grieving but HEY fuck the west eh?
4580 2018-11-26 17:37:37 ..and Palm Oil.
4581 2018-11-26 17:37:31 Not oil... Hamburger Grease.
4582 2018-11-26 17:37:29 Yes. It’s Pakistani lawmakers interpretation of the religious law. Other Muslim countries look at it differently. Again, please differentiate between local man made laws and religious law. Both not the same.
4583 2018-11-26 17:37:17 Ricky Jay was awesome. Smooth as new silk, and slick as sweet crude oil.
4584 2018-11-26 17:37:09 @nysc_ng it has come to my attention that along with the Banking industry the Oil and Gas industry has also been closed to corp members why?
4585 2018-11-26 17:37:09 There was a good chunk of the Oilers fanbase who thought they'd sweep their 3-game trip after getting by the Sharks but my question is why? In the grand scheme of things, they likely should've done a little better but 3 of 6 points on the road is a successful trip for most teams.
4586 2018-11-26 17:37:05 As long as there is oil for governments to make money on there will never be a complete switch to electric...
4587 2018-11-26 17:36:54 Along with their socialist policies&political corruption that resulted in chronic shortages of food & medicine, closure of companies, deterioration of productivity-results from socialist policies-& yes their high dependence on oil have all contributed to the country's downfall.
4588 2018-11-26 17:36:51 Me too I'll goan put oil on my face and snap! Should i use kings or power oil?
4589 2018-11-26 17:36:47 TOTAL LIE. Check any oil price  chart, the TRUTH is prices have been rising since you took office. You just love to lie, don't you?

4593 2018-11-26 17:36:34 Gasoline is up though, so is LP. What's the point of bragging about it when everything we want oil prices down for aren't pricing down?
4594 2018-11-26 17:36:34 I’m getting my oil changed and we’re waiting for my filter to come in from somewhere and the guys were like.... “we’re gonna have a quick smoke break if that’s cool w u while we wait for ur filter to come in” like yeah dawg go do you  happy Monday G, pass the blunt
4595 2018-11-26 17:36:28 Hahaha hohoho very funny
4596 2018-11-26 17:36:26 When you say "you are getting oil at 14", what are you referring to? Who is "you"? And who do you think reaps the profits from gasoline sales? Certainly not the crude producers.
4597 2018-11-26 17:36:12 BillC69 stuff
Support Oil
4598 2018-11-26 17:36:08 Just getting an oil change/service on the company car and the team here at Ritchey Cadillac/ Buick/ GMC always make me feel like I’m their only customer. Always over the top customer service from these folks. #RitcheyCadillac
4599 2018-11-26 17:36:00 RT @POTUS: RT @realDonaldTrump: So great that oil prices are falling (thank you President T). Add that, which is like a big Tax Cut, to our other good Economic news. Inflation down (are you listening Fed)!
4600 2018-11-26 17:36:00 Yes. That’s the man made country law that’s at fault. Do differentiate it from the religious law.
4601 2018-11-26 17:35:54 The #ColtsVIP Tailgate is now held at our state-of-the-art Bullseye Event Center, on S Capitol Ave just across from Lucas Oil Stadium! As for travel packages, give us a call at (317) 800-5820. 
4602 2018-11-26 17:35:50 So now he'll be able to Harper any legislation he wants to slam through against our best interest.
4603 2018-11-26 17:35:47 Oil prices falling. Was that the trade-off you were promised for looking the other way in the Murder of Jamal Khashoggi?
4604 2018-11-26 17:35:46 The Saudis supply a mere 13% of the oil consumed by the US. If they decide to raise oil prices because we correctly and ethically condemn MBS for ordering the torture and murder of a journalist, screw them! It wouldn’t hurt any of us to use a little less fossil fuel!
4605 2018-11-26 17:35:31 I hope I'm repeating majority of replies:   people w/the most vested interest in profits are the ones poisoning us w/their pollution.  

That can include scientists, but corporate oil, gas, coal, chemical, & political lackeys are most at fault.
4606 2018-11-26 17:35:29 Have you tried covering yourself in olive oil and then dusting yourself with icing sugar?
4607 2018-11-26 17:35:27 Aldous J. Pennyfarthing for prez! 
I do recall Dick Cheney stating unequivocally the war in Iraq would cost only $9 billion. It would pay for itself bc of oil.
4608 2018-11-26 17:35:24 oil?
4609 2018-11-26 17:35:22 Is Cadbury still using PALM OIL in its products ?Would like to no please?
4610 2018-11-26 17:35:21 So the problem is limitation of implementation by local law, not the religious law itself.
4611 2018-11-26 17:35:15 The display of willful ignorance from today's Republicans is disgusting.  Elected Republicans are whores for the oil industry, and Republican voters don't realize they're being played and their votes are being sold. They believe politicians over scientists.
4612 2018-11-26 17:35:15 This is true.  Wasn't suggesting it was the whole pie.  Only meant with regards to oil.
4613 2018-11-26 17:35:00 You are getting kids moving!!
4614 2018-11-26 17:34:54 Why wasn’t this trough filled with burning oil a few days ago?

4619 2018-11-26 17:34:44 As the US imports less and less oil it Imports fewer and fewer dollars could be equally true.

It matters less what oil does than what the entire trade balance does.

If there’s a shift back, it’ll be driven by interest rates rather than oil IMO
4623 2018-11-26 17:34:13 @Take5_OilChange Best Oil Change Service I ever had.
4624 2018-11-26 17:34:08 People on Facebook always post shit like “wHerE cAn I gET mY oIL cHaNgEd aT!?!” Like, you know you can just type that into google right? & you know it will almost instantly pop up with like 50 different places right?
4625 2018-11-26 17:34:06 All I now is we may see $11 or $15 dollar oil not out of the question. in 5 years you may not own a car and a autonomous EV comes to pick you up and drop you off . That would be a hell of a tax cut no insurance or gas pump.
4626 2018-11-26 17:34:03 Sure it is! Check out the horror they did to black Americans in the 60's. Dogs, water cannons, billy clubs, and tear gas. We are not alone in these tactics.  Look at Yemen. The English starved the Irish, setting women on fire for being raped....boiling oil over the castle walls.
4627 2018-11-26 17:34:01 Yes yes yes, and the sea and fishing grounds + oil rigs they stole of us.
4628 2018-11-26 17:33:58 Here in India tech is considered sunrise industry. I hadn't heard of the sunset to define the oil industry until you said it here. I mean Bucky has been going on about it. But do you see a date on that last dip of that sunset anytime soon?
4629 2018-11-26 17:33:55 Soooo great to meet you.  Great job on the Lucy series!!
4630 2018-11-26 17:33:54 Talking about how the oil & gas sector has gobbled up more than its fair share of the "innovation" funds in Canada -- I'm sure #GeneralMotors could have used some of that money to dev & build EVs. 
#cdnpoli #onpoli
4631 2018-11-26 17:33:53 “With oil down 30%, we will now be exporting 30% less than we were a month ago”. In terms of dollars exported, need to consider entire trade deficit. Oil trade is fraction of the dollar supply channel to foreign markets. Incorrect to suggest it is entire pie.
4632 2018-11-26 17:33:51 "لا إله إلا الله، وحده لا شريك لهُ، له الملك وله الحمدُ، وهو على كل شيء قديرٌ"،
سبحانه له الملك وله الحمد، في السماء ملكه، وفي الأرض سلطانه، وفي الجنة رحمته، وفي النار سطوته، وفي البحر عظمته، وفي الكائنات حكمته،
"سُبحان الله وبحمده، سُبحان الله العظيم".

4636 2018-11-26 17:33:40 We don’t like chocolate made with palm oil of any kind! It’s gross!
4637 2018-11-26 17:33:40 Robert Mueller wasn't the Commander in Chief so the blame of what u speak falls on Bush who started the car in Iraq for family feud & oil purposes, So once again u are trying to slander Mueller for a Bush job, like Trump does 2 Hillary with Bill/Obama

Saudis helped US rid of saddam who wanted to control all Mideast oil. Bad/US ecnomy
4642 2018-11-26 17:33:13 But this change is not always directly proportionate to the fluctuations in crude oil price. There is something more to it.
4643 2018-11-26 17:33:13 Once again, the LAGO red herring is used to NOT ACTUALLY ADDRESS THE PROBLEM. News flash, murder is a crime with a significant number of first-time offenders. A significant number of non-fatal impulse gun crime is committed by first-time offenders.
4644 2018-11-26 17:33:10 Appreciate the effort of @melkg_, @Kittya_Cullen, @TamanishaJohn & @saieedkhalil in constantly tweeting/responding to me. My original statement was that the oil "could" benefit Guyana and its people. This is a fact.

4646 2018-11-26 17:32:49 This fall in oil prices will cause economic chaos in Nigeria's projections! @tvcnewsng @YlanreTVC

4648 2018-11-26 17:32:37 No that I am okay with, until it is the death path. The death path has the whole thing covered in oil. XD
4649 2018-11-26 17:32:35 And they decompose???? Oh and then she tried to tell me that “there’s the same amount of oil used in both of them” as though that’s really gonna outweigh the amount of CO2 emissions that come from improper recycling of plastic bags???? Stupid as fuck

4651 2018-11-26 17:32:32 Mine actually was hoooorrrrribble a few months ago, adjusting to being a SAHM in a new place I’d never been and trying to find myself was realllyyyy rough. It got better when I started taking CB d oil and now it’s coming back again. Gonna have to find another way to cope! 
4652 2018-11-26 17:32:31 The oil? The butter? The actual nut?
4653 2018-11-26 17:32:29 Petrol price in UAE is approx 90pkr. And do you know that UAE do not import oil as they have their own. But still the price is 90pkr. Do some research and talk with facts and figures
4654 2018-11-26 17:32:18 After your 100 days, Take a break champ. You might have a giki engine, run by shlum oil with McKinsey efficiency in you, the rest of your team doesn't.

4656 2018-11-26 17:31:57 It just bothers me a bit that people who claim to be socialists at home are so blasé about vast profits being made on overseas investments. Seems a bit like the new imperialism to me. Also u really can’t be both pro oil money and anti fossil fuels, can u?
4657 2018-11-26 17:31:56 GM Plant is a casualty of low oil prices and people choosing SUV and CUV over cars and possibly keeping them longer than doing the 3-year lease thing.
4658 2018-11-26 17:31:55 Delicious had some frozen potatoes with onions and bell peppers cut up a red hot put a lil oil in a skillet simple breakfast with a can of beer I didn't finish last night hahaha
4659 2018-11-26 17:31:49 Not surprising that all our govs can offer is reaction...seemingly with no understanding of what is happening on this planet.  The days of oil/oil powered vehicles are all but gone...denial is a not a good strategy.
4660 2018-11-26 17:31:49 idk if it’s as simple as oil.i think it’s lots of different things
1) lots of incentive money into leasing big cars (interest rate driven) 
2) secular shift in consumer taste to bigger cars 
3) capex used to develop bigger cars since they make all the money
4661 2018-11-26 17:31:38 Yes.
4662 2018-11-26 17:31:37 gotta get my oil changed and tires aligned too .
4663 2018-11-26 17:31:36 That's a tough one hey, lol my hair was the same but argan oil saved me.
4664 2018-11-26 17:31:34 Peppermint oil and eucalyptus oil! It's the only I can take bc preggers all the time but they work so well!
4665 2018-11-26 17:31:26 Reminds me of ‘There’s so much fucking oil on the plate the United States wants to invade it.’ He’s always on some tangent 
4666 2018-11-26 17:31:10 I guess you don’t drive or heat your house. What’s it like living off the grid, a wee bit sanctimonious don’t you think? If we stop importing oil from other countries because we no longer use it then your point would be valid.
4667 2018-11-26 17:31:10 watch Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj on Netflix. he breaks down trending topics -Oil, saudi Arabia, affirmative action, immigration etc.
4668 2018-11-26 17:31:09 So gas today at Costco in #ldnont is 87 cents per liter today. Just a reminder to everyone, this has more to do with those pesky pipelines and oil prices than anything Doug Ford has done.
4669 2018-11-26 17:31:07 Let me come and mine oil now 
4670 2018-11-26 17:31:05 You actually need to add palm oil to it for optimum performance...

4673 2018-11-26 17:30:51 Your talk is not helping. What’s your plan to replace the job lost? Do you even have a plan.  Let build a gas refinery and Alberta can ship oil.  You do not need to but Saudi Arabia oil.  We have oil. That’s a plan. Justin time to leave the stage.
4674 2018-11-26 17:30:47 It can't  last forever.. not even  supporting  or making business with wars or Oil . We have reached the time where  if one fails the castle  will go down. Globalization brother. Not enough for all. Hoping for a better world without genocides.
4675 2018-11-26 17:30:42 Do we know why it's down today?
4676 2018-11-26 17:30:38 Using @CURLShaircare products, they even have a hair oil for hair growth
4677 2018-11-26 17:30:32 In the real world, if you put a bunch of money into one idea and you shit the bed (crypto, oil, etc..) then you probably go out of business or at least get fired.

On TV, if you pump the same stuff, and get it 100% ass backwards, they just ask you "So...what are you buying now?"

4695 2018-11-26 17:29:24 However, it’s hard to completely eliminate given how many products it is in so why not at least try to use products that get palm oil sustainably?  Also, this app was recommended to me by someone big on orangutan conservation who does her research so credible enough for me. 2/2

4704 2018-11-26 17:28:53 And reduce their workforces. Go go! Go oil differential price!
4705 2018-11-26 17:28:48 ‘‘tis the season of covering my entire body in coconut oil as soon as I get out of the shower so I don’t flake like a croissant
4706 2018-11-26 17:28:45 Not to mention the hide of people in coal and oil lobbyist pockets claiming they are experts on climate based on zilch knowledge or skills
4707 2018-11-26 17:28:44 When the suns angle is just right,you can see the colors burst! Like that color sheen on top of oil slicks.
We called them DogStars when I was a kid,they weren’t common!Now it’s almost daily.
4708 2018-11-26 17:28:43 Put some coconut oil on him or aloe Vera gel
4709 2018-11-26 17:28:40 It certainly can on a short-term but not long-term. Obviously, the perfect mix is a marriage of two but that's easier said than done.
4710 2018-11-26 17:28:39 We don't need pipelines and oil & gas, what do we need cars/car plants for? Can we all get windsails and canoes instead?

4713 2018-11-26 17:28:16 And several times as many indigenous men, but nobody seems to care about them.
4714 2018-11-26 17:28:12 Even if PDP have confused your brain and abused your thought processes, you should pray for deliverance. 

Between 2011 and 2015, Nigeria's economy was powered by high crude oil proceeds and gigantic borrowings. An aeroplane whose fuel finishes mid air is bound to crash...Think!
4715 2018-11-26 17:28:09 If Shetland wants that, they can vote for it. UNCLOS probably wouldn't give them *much* oil, in all honesty, although they'd still make a killing (as they do now) from the processing that's done on the islands.
4716 2018-11-26 17:28:03 Climate is warming=YES. Humans caused it=MAYBE. USA caused it=MAYBE. USA running out of oil=YES (& we're stupidly exporting it at rock-bottom prices??)
4717 2018-11-26 17:28:02 The audacity of trump (sneaky SOB) to actually suggest to Iran that THEY owe us for helping with a war so that he can steal their oil for his own benefit. That's against international law & humiliating to us who must endure trump's IMMORAL & UNAMERICAN behavior.
4718 2018-11-26 17:28:02 There is NO science behind essential oil "cures". To me they're just smell-goods and that's all there is to it. If it somehow helped you, good! But I worry for people like you who were put on meds for a reason. There is NO replacement for a medical expert's advice. Not even EO's.
4719 2018-11-26 17:27:58 I came to get an oil change and they really think they finna tell me all this other stuff wrong with my car  uh uh change my oil I gotta go
4720 2018-11-26 17:27:56 i put castor oil in my hair lastnight after showering and let’s just say this is some bullshit 
4721 2018-11-26 17:27:51 I actually use @CheyenneMtnZoo palm oil app to check palm oil.  They receive criticism because they consider if companies are a member of RSPO instead of elimination of palm oil altogether.  1/2
4722 2018-11-26 17:27:44 Just read in my nursing textbook that lavender oil can cause breast growth in young boys. Someone alert the anti-vaxxers.
4723 2018-11-26 17:27:40 No. They weren't. Why do you separatists have to make up lies and grievance.  There is plenty of oil out there but what is the cost of getting it out of the ground?  The companies wont develop a lot of possible fields because of the cost.
4724 2018-11-26 17:27:33 I am speaking for my family! How dare you tell us that everything is in the Shops when I cant find cooking oil, Mazowe and of course fuel for  the past month?

4729 2018-11-26 17:26:42 Over the long haul, they can only become as good as their talent allows them to be. Short term anything is possible but it all works itself out longterm.
4730 2018-11-26 17:26:39 Please no more govt bailouts for antiquated industries, oil & autos are over
4731 2018-11-26 17:26:36 I keep thinking PIT for Talbot, just because it would be such an Oilers thing to do to get Tristan Jerry, former Oil King.
4732 2018-11-26 17:26:36 Yes Ive always found it amazing how confidence carries a team even more than skill...that was not in reference to this team's confidence. I'm not the least surprised about that.
4733 2018-11-26 17:26:32 Our fuel has been superceded by cheaper oil. The cars built in Oshawa were no longer in demand. No matter how you slice it, these industries were far more precarious and impermanent than politicians of any party wanted to admit during the hey day.
4734 2018-11-26 17:26:28 they can apply at any American consulate or embassy....and being IN American soil requires one to be dead or run a soil supply company(kind of like "I'm in oil.")..
4735 2018-11-26 17:26:28 Pleasant Pistol! Essential Oil blends made specifically to fight odor causing bacteria between the legs!
4736 2018-11-26 17:26:25 As a Prostate cancer sufferer I can tell you this story is rubbish if not fake - reason you require THC/CBD not CBD alone - the facts  I was using THC/CBD and it made matters worse see profile chart and see spike this was induced by Cannabis oil
4737 2018-11-26 17:26:24 Let's all stop making cars and go back to only making gigantic trucks again, Oil is at $50 so that's all people want for now and ever.  What could possibly go wrong?
4738 2018-11-26 17:26:21 But they still fight for coal, oil and increasing consume of goods....
4739 2018-11-26 17:26:19 Top lap for the equipment you had. But compared to todays cars, it was like you had oil on your tires!
4740 2018-11-26 17:26:15 Indian oil be like don't shell out your money
4741 2018-11-26 17:26:11 I read online castor oil helps 
4742 2018-11-26 17:26:05 20. The number of minutes it took today for @AIM_Summit to give a Saudi the mic to start shilling oil. Gmtfooh
4743 2018-11-26 17:26:04 Never mind the oil; Tell us more about the 57 Gaelic speakers.
4744 2018-11-26 17:26:01 Europe importing migrants from countries they arrogantly bomb and go to war under false pretenses to steal their oil -  destroying their culture, their economy and their life. Migrants harboring grudges, exacting revenge on their women. Vicious.
4745 2018-11-26 17:25:53 Err, isn't that a bad thing for local oil and gas extraction? Cheaper prices from abroad = less margin locally.
4746 2018-11-26 17:25:49 Don't recall you calling Trudeau's deliberate destruction of the Alberta economy and oil industry devastating. Don't suppose it matters it is only Albertans
4747 2018-11-26 17:25:48 Everything he did was wrong. The pasta wasn’t al dente, who the HELL uses prosciutto?! Olive oil on the pasta?! No pecorino. Jesus Christ, that was very hard to watch
4748 2018-11-26 17:25:45 Me: *goes for an oil change *

Mechanic: while we were doing your oil change we found that you have 2 flat fires, 3 broken belts, your engine caught on fire and you nee-

Me: oil change. 

Mechanic: but sir if you don’t fix these things your car will expl-

Me: oil. Change.
4749 2018-11-26 17:25:39 Maybe time you redirected your attention to Canada...GM jobs leaving...Western Oil investment and jobs leaving...etc etc... quit telling the rest of the world how to live their lives and look after Canada FFS
4750 2018-11-26 17:25:33 You ever just eat something wit so much oil and grease you think to urself like "why the FUCK am I letting this bs enter my fucking stomach"
4751 2018-11-26 17:25:33 yeah but quinn isnt even in the list to see the replacement.. and just because its similar doesnt mean it acts the same.. plus the other oil bottles are over 80$ while i can barely afford 1 bottle at 40$..as if we needed to be rich to use medical cannabis
4752 2018-11-26 17:25:32 Why is it so expensive to get your oil changed
4753 2018-11-26 17:25:29 Please try cbd oil. It is changing my wellbeing. Never dreamed I could have less pain and sleep better . I hope you feel better soon. Soft hugs
4754 2018-11-26 17:25:27 I know theres one by an oil Derrick, north west from Pleasant (?)
4755 2018-11-26 17:25:23 Oil + pipelines + old-fashioned sedans. You'd think governments would pick up on the obvious trends in these sectors and subsidize emerging technology and industry. What is with the resistance to adapt? #cdnpoli
4756 2018-11-26 17:25:19 The #GiletsJaunes phenomena is just a prelude to what could happen across #Europe if the U.S further tampers with the oil market and keeps pursuing its adventuristic "zero sales" policy vis-a-vis #Iran.
4757 2018-11-26 17:25:18 Yep. The SNP called on the Tories AND Labour to set up a similar fund here and were told in the politest parliamentary language to go and fuck themselves because the oil is for them and them alone. Had anyone listened, the UK would be as rich as Norway.
4758 2018-11-26 17:25:14 ...and uses environmentalist to protest pipelines so his rails can continue to move oil in a far more risky fashion.

4760 2018-11-26 17:25:08 Crude market volatility has soared in the second half of 2018, with prices touching a four year high before entering their longest losing streak in three decades. Analysts were calling for $100 oil but now seem to think prices will head as low as $40.
Seemingly good news.

4762 2018-11-26 17:24:50 share some detail on the "deep disappointment" convo?  And as far as doing "everything we can to help the families affected by this news get back on their feet" is concerned, is that the federal "let them eat cake" formula Alberta's decimated oil industry is enjoying?
4763 2018-11-26 17:24:45 No surprise, although I am surprised that the Oilers haven’t at least publicly, hire a sports shrink. They can only become as good as they believe they can be
4764 2018-11-26 17:24:42 Normal to dry. Mcm2 dah try cleansing oil tp tak sesuai.naik tiny bump, gatal
4765 2018-11-26 17:24:42 i’m getting my cbd oil
4766 2018-11-26 17:24:37 Without western oil money, who will fund this support now? #groper #mrdressup #peoplekind #gropergate #fuckthewest
4767 2018-11-26 17:24:32 Is Canada really sending $80 million in oil wealth to the Americans every day? WOW!  Once again startled at how the Trudeau media explains the oil business.  Totally clueless!
4768 2018-11-26 17:24:26 Well yeah. His investment in crude oil has. Big play in it.  He loves those money making fossil fuels
4769 2018-11-26 17:24:21 Today is one of those days where I'm so incredibly upset with the world, especially Donald Dickhead Trump. What the hell is going on. Fuck these corrupt leaders and their wars, their oil. Fuck these religious nutjobs who regress our morals and values. Fuck you, Putin. Madness.
4770 2018-11-26 17:24:13 So, Kent have learned that actually,  Snake Skin Oil is exactly that, good for nothing.
4771 2018-11-26 17:24:07 صعبة عليك 
4772 2018-11-26 17:24:01 Fair but for me, the word "unbelievable" suggests there is some kind of surprise attached to it. My bad.
4773 2018-11-26 17:23:55 Donny so GM is shutting down four auto plants in the USA in its move toward electric vehicles while you promote oil, coal, and muskets.
4774 2018-11-26 17:23:54 When PTI took the office the prices of Oil was above US $70 per barrel and in Pakistan price was around Rs:90 now its below US $50 and price in Pakistan increased to Rs:97.83
4775 2018-11-26 17:23:40 The Final Table has opened my eyes about things we tell ourselves to stay away from in the kitchen. Fam. USE the butter. Use oil. Eat the damn egg yolk! If you’re eating unhealthy food, that’s when those components should be avoided!
4776 2018-11-26 17:23:38 Thanks very much Oil 
4777 2018-11-26 17:23:35 Oil prices bounce back after friday plunge.
4778 2018-11-26 17:23:33 I don’t care about anyone east of Winnipeg but I also don’t think autoworkers are overpaid, they get paid a dogs breakfast. Maybe they wanna come work in the patch? We got 2500 more people ready to get oil to tidewater baby! #boomtown
4779 2018-11-26 17:23:32 "ma'am during your oil change we found out that your car is just two cardboard boxes glued together?" shut up put the oil in
4780 2018-11-26 17:23:31 @HalftimeReport @ScottWapnerCNBC @SquawkAlley @carlquintanilla @MorganLBrennan @JackieDeAngelis @Lebeaucarnews So #Trump pushing for lower #oil #wti #brent actually pushing US consumers to buy bigger SUV (hence $GM cutting smaller car built),...talk about unintended consequences!
4781 2018-11-26 17:23:28 I turn clock upside down it is very funny hahaha
4782 2018-11-26 17:23:25 For sure, we need jobs. What will make our oil cheaper than other oil to bring those jobs back? What will make robots stop taking manufacturing jobs?

4786 2018-11-26 17:23:13 Oil approaching neckline, she gonna pop soon.
4787 2018-11-26 17:23:03 Herman Manyora you cannot be this thick! You can also defend the school boys if you so want! As an elder, you should be speaking solutions to this moral decadence, not airing your bloated emotions!
4788 2018-11-26 17:23:02 
4789 2018-11-26 17:22:54 Agree on that. Certainly not swing (as per the traditional oil definition). But it feels to me that shale is more responsive to the upside than what I have anticipated.
4790 2018-11-26 17:22:53 Hi clare..I just want to share I have been using cbd oil over a month and it is helping so much . I wouldn't have believed it.  I have suffered with chronic pain since a teen . You may want to try it .
4791 2018-11-26 17:22:50 Sweet, thank you! And yeah, everyone’s hair and skin is different. I used to wash my hair everyday and it would be fine, now if I wash my hair a few days in a row, I produce a little extra oil. So it’s just a matter of your hair getting used to whatever you’re trying to do.
4792 2018-11-26 17:22:37 Oil falling is about Asia and Emerging Markets getting hammered and slowing down. Canda and America producing more. We might see OPEC fall apart like Communism soon .It's all about autonomous EV and natural gas. the short oil is getting crowded. Pick one. I have no clue 
4793 2018-11-26 17:22:36 Just curious, what is way better? They are a middling .500 team as is every other team in their division not named SJ and Calgary...though Vegas apparently wants to get back into that group. They are right about where they should be, scratching and clawing for a playoff spot.
4794 2018-11-26 17:22:26 Go get oil changed or take a nap first ?
4795 2018-11-26 17:22:25 I see oil below 50 in two days - typical deadcat
4796 2018-11-26 17:22:16 Forget blaming whoever for whatever, facts are:
1) Future #Oil demand will be soft & building an economy around lowest grade oil is suicidal.
2) Rejecting #ClimateAction fails cuz:
-climate damage is unaffordable
-in #economy vs #environment, the economy was always going to lose.
4797 2018-11-26 17:22:14 He sure the hell is worried about Oshawa workers though. That I don't begrudge but he's proven he doesn't give a shit about thousands of out of work Albertans. They aren't selling enough cars whereas we have plenty of market for our oil if we could just get a pipeline built.
4798 2018-11-26 17:22:13 Volumes are super-low, meaning there's little bid. Just leaking oil right now. All of the majors are.
4799 2018-11-26 17:22:08 It got real in Alberta on Oct. 19, 2015. You noticed but most so called national media did not. Trudeau has deliberately decimated the oil industry, 100,00+ jobs and Alberta economy and no one cares but cut 2800 jobs in Oshawa and it a national disaster
4800 2018-11-26 17:22:03 You elect Jason you elect a shill for big oil nothing more. Where is his strategy ? Just another con blowhard full of nothing but miss direction and fear promotion. Did nothing in ten years on this file while  sucking of the nations nations tit. Shut oil to BC typical con fear bs
4801 2018-11-26 17:22:01 if I could douse myself in sandalwood oil I probably would
4802 2018-11-26 17:22:00 Women and men that have a record of supporting lies by selling guns and ammo to Saudi terrorists for oil have no business speaking on behalf of those put in harm's way for personal status and gain with civil servant job security above accountability #Monday #America

4804 2018-11-26 17:21:55 @aycawe @Powerfm987 I recently went to Masvingo, Zim and obviously with shortage of cooking oil and other stuff, I had to transport a few.  I ended up with $bonds and I had to exchange that at the black foreign exchange markets.. It's the way to go in Zim
4805 2018-11-26 17:21:55 The only effective action would be a G7 oil purchasing embargo on Russia. Oil money props up the Russian mafia state.
4806 2018-11-26 17:21:54 I didnt say anything about being surprised. I
4807 2018-11-26 17:21:49 eating a diet full of salmon, sweet potatoes & bell peppers! and of course coconut oil & the basic shit that everyone knows 
4808 2018-11-26 17:21:43 Well I really like the idea here and it could go far.
Well done Keith.
4809 2018-11-26 17:21:43 It's true, but the number of people who would eat it is small.
I love hot food. One drop of the one million Scoville unit oil I have makes two cups of rice too hot for me. 
The residue from the oil, while being rinsed off bothers my eyes. 
Pepper spray is over a million.
4810 2018-11-26 17:21:37 I’m so glad they tore down the Whole Foods building & took months of construction with oil and concrete to build a huge new building to house an identical health food store with a different name.
4811 2018-11-26 17:21:37 The more you wash your hair the more oil it produces cause you’re stripping your hair of it’s naturals oils so it’s working twice as hard to replace the oils and that’s why it’s getting greasy fast. Try using a dry shampoo in between ur days of not washing and washing (:
4812 2018-11-26 17:21:35 #Resistance still gets you wars for plunder, oil pipelines on sovereign land, and #Flint with no clean water. I’m way beyond resistance and all the way into #revolution. Nothing short of that will do
4813 2018-11-26 17:21:34 Shame on you ND! Once again you are on the wrong side of history! We sparked a climate change revolution! Better start changing now cause the world is! Give back those donations from big oil before your caught! If trump is guilty your guilty! He approved a Illegal pipeline!!! 
4814 2018-11-26 17:21:29 tell your 'friend' to tell him he's supposed to drop his load in a blender..

4818 2018-11-26 17:21:07 You got Brexit and you Catalunya that wants to become independent, yet the French will protest harder for rising tax on oil and gas.
4819 2018-11-26 17:20:57 Getting an oil change stresses me out. Am I the only one afraid that you will end up with fifty million things wrong with your car???
4820 2018-11-26 17:20:53 Lamp oil! RAPE! Bombs! You want it?
4821 2018-11-26 17:20:48 I smell like I’m ovulating right now. Thanks @KrazyEssentials lmao Dry body oil and I don’t know what scent cuz I rubbed the label off 
4822 2018-11-26 17:20:48 Dear vicky..try CBD oil..it has helped me so much to function better .
4823 2018-11-26 17:20:37 You are using poison if we believe Harvard person. Anyway, coconut oil is the reason for Malayali women glowing. Tamil guys would vouch for it.
4824 2018-11-26 17:20:26 Canada is an oil driven economy, which is why taxes will not deter people from buying and consuming oil. By increasing the prices on basic necessities, the carbon tax will only make basic items be less affordable to the public. It's a way of sneaking in socialism. #ONPoli
4825 2018-11-26 17:20:22 Big sale on the Clarisonic site today. I'm cheap. I literally wash my face with castor oil. But after 3.5 decades of completely shit skin, why not.
4826 2018-11-26 17:20:20 Remember the story of Icarus and what he was told: make sure the oil is hot enough. Fry in batches, about 13 minutes each. There’s no such thing as “too much sauce”.
4827 2018-11-26 17:20:15 I hope one of those 30 cities is in Black sea so I can personally thank the comrade that yelled hard portski b4 th yr hit the ship and blocked the straight.  With  oil tanker
4828 2018-11-26 17:20:03 btw @JohnGormleyShow when I said that "the same people that own the government whether it be Trudeau or Harper are the same damn people that own the oil." I don't think I lost you I think I was making too much sense and it's more information then the people are suppose to know.
4829 2018-11-26 17:19:58 Doing our part to contribute to the global #oil #oversupply.  When prices drop, producers will blame #environmental #regulations, though.

4831 2018-11-26 17:19:55 Innovations like electric cars, solar-electric, wind-electric, hydro-electric? All the innovations the GOP is fighting. They like oil & coal because they are personally making money from the corps on these. Great way to run a gov't. Vote for Dems to save the planet!
4832 2018-11-26 17:19:47 After the previous two seasons, you are still surprised by the impact of confidence with this group? It's difficult to keep the confidence at a high point when the roster arguably gets worse every year. Rinse and repeat...rinse and repeat. #Oilers
4833 2018-11-26 17:19:44 Idk who need to see this but go get your mf oil changed
4834 2018-11-26 17:19:34 Baby boomers.

4835 2018-11-26 17:19:24 Mite oil ?
4836 2018-11-26 17:19:16 trump continues his insult to our intelligence. We already knew the lower oil prices are temporary due to previous ‘stockpiles’ & the residual 4% his criminal buddy, the Saudi prince manipulated for the midterms...duh.  
4837 2018-11-26 17:19:13 Keith is a good guy, very interesting person to speak with
4838 2018-11-26 17:19:12 Hi, we would love to send you a free sample of our latest beard oil to review, please let me know if you are interested?..
4839 2018-11-26 17:19:03 Not until the oil actually has finally run out. I can’t believe some otherwise intelligent people can’t see it.
4840 2018-11-26 17:18:59 Size means little in terms of longevity. It’s the saturation pressure of the reservoir that will determine how long the oil will flow. Larger reserves have been squandered in much shorter time.
4841 2018-11-26 17:18:57 A dead journalist plays into this.  A murdered Mr. Khashoggi and trump sides w/the murderer, Prince Salman who gives him cheap oil to protect him. Two Saudi sisters, same.

4847 2018-11-26 17:18:32 Corruption everywhere!
KPLC, NCPB, KPC, NYS, LBDA, NIB, NHIF, SGR, Youth & Women Funds, etc. It is sickening. Depressing when told by KPC that oil leaked and none leaked in all the locations named. Let us stop this madness. Mr.@UKenyatta you have my back and Kenyan backs.

4849 2018-11-26 17:18:26 Whole issue is on www, rule of India in 1947 was handed as per agenda more than 500 yrs old, it was expided with Arabia getting oil which brought riches and it started on its journey of conversion which was painful, violent & atrocious. Iran, Syria done. India unfinished agenda.
4850 2018-11-26 17:18:19 Glad Trump didn’t listen to moral puritans in Congress, he knows how to extract his pound of flesh. He turned the Saudi’s crisis into an opportunity for America. US gets to keep defense contracts and low oil prices, all for one reckless operation by Saudi operatives.

4855 2018-11-26 17:17:47 @nntaleb Dear Nassim, although being a Med, the late Bernardo Bertolucci used butter as a lubricant in the famous scene and not olive oil. Does this square up with recent observations of yours that parts of Italy like Milan are not really Med-like?
4856 2018-11-26 17:17:43 Remember this when oil prices are going through the roof...if you want to take credit for it now you'll have to take credit for it then also.I'll be back to remind you too....
4857 2018-11-26 17:17:38 Khashoggi was on to a great deal more wrt SA than just the oil abuses.
4858 2018-11-26 17:17:37 Anyone have an air fryer? Do you adore it? The one I've been eyeing dropped $20 (total $50) today. I don't fry things often, but when I do I hate the mess and amount of oil needed.

4863 2018-11-26 17:17:30 Coal, oil and other unsustainable fuels are yesterday’s news...Trump and his billionaire bastards will bleed our country dry and then take a flight on Musk’s spaceship  to the dark side of the moon where they have constructed their new Utopia made from cheese...hahaha
4864 2018-11-26 17:17:24 I’m sitting in caribou drinking a peppermint mocha re-watching vampire diaries while waiting for my oil change to be done. I’m really being that kind of girl.
4865 2018-11-26 17:17:20 Thank you from the disabled and elderly who find it hard to heat their homes for winter...The lower oil prices will help them save money so they can eat and pay their heating bill. Thank You.

4868 2018-11-26 17:16:54 Yep. Good ole oil and gas. The industry that’s habitually in crisis no matter if oil is trading at >$130/barrel or <$40/barrel. We always need to give them more.

Ok folks, holiday break is over, it's time to fire off more letters and make some noise. Between gassing #refugee families on the Mexico boarder, oil companies knowingly causing #ClimateChange for profit, 1/x
4872 2018-11-26 17:16:42 1) I'm not American, he is not my president.
2) He should not order thanks from the Fed for lowering oil prices
3) There is no goddamn way i'll pass up the opportunity for a Mr. T joke
4) Respect is earned, not given. And Donald Trump has not earned my respect.
4873 2018-11-26 17:16:38 After the oil spill in the Gulf, cruise ships everywhere, does seafood require testing or inspection of any kind?
4874 2018-11-26 17:16:29 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...

4876 2018-11-26 17:16:27 We could not pass a carbon tax :((  but I think other states should try to!  Big oil spent a FORTUNE taking that down...  and spooky people. When it comes down to it, it's ALL about the COST of everything.  And I don't mean rhetorical..
4877 2018-11-26 17:16:25 Hey get some oregano oil. It helped stop me from getting sick. Got it at Whole Foods
4878 2018-11-26 17:16:23 ... who cares about cars if there is no oil and gas to run them?
4879 2018-11-26 17:16:22 Postmedia is owned by an American hedge fund and the National Enquirer. It has a stated mandate to support the oil companies and introduce American style conservatism to Canada. This is not news, it is propaganda.
4880 2018-11-26 17:16:21 You will use Virgin Olive oil for life now.
4881 2018-11-26 17:16:20 You think the price of oil falling is thanks to you?

4882 2018-11-26 17:16:17 The growth rate is largely based on how much oil the mullahs sell to fund their terrorist operations and proxies worldwide and pocket the rest. Really doesn't make a significant difference to the ordinary people
4883 2018-11-26 17:16:15 Not sure anyone has a problem with him running up the score. It’s being a disingenuous snake oil salesman. At least have the balls to own it
4884 2018-11-26 17:16:15 As someone who takes money from oil companies, @RickSantorum is driven by money to deny climate science. Apparently there is a lot of money on that side of “research”
4885 2018-11-26 17:16:13 Cisco Systems (CSCO) gained 1.706% today amid reports that they’re loose or because of the oil
4886 2018-11-26 17:16:08 How do you have a job at Queen's? I hope your knowledge of economics far exceeds your knowledge of pipeline projects. Keystone delivers to the Gulf to the largest oil export port in the US. I doubt any CDN bbls are exported given their refining margins, but they can.
4887 2018-11-26 17:15:55 nothing to do with the oil then

4891 2018-11-26 17:15:48 @zkeefer Sorry if I caught you off guard yelling your name on the stairs at Lucas Oil yesterday. Just wanted to say you have had excellent stories this season - keep up the good work!
4892 2018-11-26 17:15:45 Oil rules the world. Too much or too little production & economy suffers. Wish we could get off it entirely. What Trump is not seeing is how an oil glut is very unhealthy for the economy. Bracing for the meltdown

4898 2018-11-26 17:15:16 GM came up with the EV1 which could have put them far ahead of @elonmusk decades ago and they sold out to oil.  Now the only way to see one of few cars that weren’t crushed is in a museum. 

SHAME ON YOU GM.  

PLEASE WATCH the documentary ‘Who killed the Electric Car?’.  
4899 2018-11-26 17:15:14 My Clio does 180 only when the brake light and oil pressure light is on 
4900 2018-11-26 17:15:12 my glasses are always slipping off of my face but idk if it’s because they’re loose or because of the oil

4903 2018-11-26 17:14:42 @ProfOsinbajo sir, there are many areas to prospect for oil in the proven oil rich Niger Delta. Why then is the government wastingresources exploring for same in chad? Nigeria disappoints me sir.

4907 2018-11-26 17:14:24 people we are getting a good deal on oil , don't forget that .
4908 2018-11-26 17:14:21 Their plan all along was to make Alberta oil uneconomical to force it to shut down. Unfortunately their plan is working.
4909 2018-11-26 17:14:20 As always, Trumpnuts are factually-challenged. They need us more than we need them. We get less than 10% of oil from them. Most comes from Canada. They cant get compatible weaponry elsewhere. It's all about Donny lining his pockets. Saudis bailed him out of bankruptcy TWICE!
4910 2018-11-26 17:14:13 Along with VWAP. Do check the sector performance as well.. eg if oil stocks are going up and u planned to short HPCL or bpcl then it makes no sense to short tjem. Right?
4911 2018-11-26 17:14:03 I think this will see 2.5 to 3p short term for sure

4913 2018-11-26 17:13:58 Yup- chequebook in hand, ready to bail out ON workers. Meanwhile, crickets for over 10000 oil patch workers in AB.
4914 2018-11-26 17:13:46 Since oil is crashing and GM is pulling out, what if we cut our losses and aim for a verticle farm infrastructure(for year round crops and a competitive edge in the food market) and research into insects as protein source.
Were already billions in deficite what's a few more.
4915 2018-11-26 17:13:45 The courts nixed Northern Gateway (link up thread), Energy East was ditched by the oil company as too expensive.
Trudeau's been PM for all of 3 years - amazing how quickly he became the bogeyman.
But facts, meh.
Conspiracy theories much more alluring to some.
4916 2018-11-26 17:13:43 Oil pumped from ground in California. Sent to refineries in California. Delivered to gas stations in California. Some of the highest gas prices in the nation.

4922 2018-11-26 17:13:22 Our oil will be going south to fund the British government’s next big project – the Great British Brexit.
4923 2018-11-26 17:13:18 Rise without fear - or have you forgotten the gulf oil spill?
4924 2018-11-26 17:13:16 This situation is not only for Maduro or Chavez, this has been for decades of corrupt and populist governments like Carlos A. Perez, Lusinchi and others with "social sensitivity" they only gave away and did not promote production and investment in other areas instead of oil
4925 2018-11-26 17:13:16 You know Rick, what I think, and have been saying and wondering since I was just a youngin' is, why doesn't @Canada make their own cars? Remember the Ford Bricklin? What if we did our own oil refinement? These thoughts were prominent in my mind growing up buying made in China.
4926 2018-11-26 17:13:15 I think you will end up marrying extra virgin Olive oil.
4927 2018-11-26 17:13:12 Which is also amazing considering we get most of our oil from Canada. And they’ve never killed someone and chopped them into pieces!
4928 2018-11-26 17:13:11 well now that I have torn my bed apart and sprayed the fuck out of the bottom of the box spring and around the base with peppermint oil I have concluded that he was a lone predator. also Ollie is not allowed in bc bad for kitties.

4933 2018-11-26 17:12:52 I remember back when there Russians were really wary of Chinese presence and extension in Venezuelan oil projects behind doors.. now we are seeing it in full.
4934 2018-11-26 17:12:45 oil prices are down because u r covering for Khashoggi's murder. Tax cut for rich only. As stores close by l00s: Sams, Penneys, Ikea dumped 7500 jobs, kleenex, toys and babies r us, radioshack, macys, sears, gymboree, staples, office depot, strip malls, mom&pop stores, more.
4935 2018-11-26 17:12:43 As @BillMcKibben points out in "Life on a Shrinking Planet", big oil has chosen to push us towards disaster to maintain their cash flow.  It's analogous to what happened on Easter Island when the last tree was cut down to help erect the last statue to one of the local chiefs.
4936 2018-11-26 17:12:38 You’re looking at a chunk of money there then straight away plus any remedial work to bring it up to Oftec requirements, and that’s before you buy a new oil boiler.
4937 2018-11-26 17:12:33 I think this could be a goodun too Josh.
The concept and the potential here is very good.
4938 2018-11-26 17:12:24 That is not 100 ..true. Because Venezuela is the worse country in Latin America and they have the biggest oil reserves in th world and the US has not done anything.
4939 2018-11-26 17:12:23 Making EXISTING (bus) transit helps us.

Building more @SWCorridor light rail is a proven way to reduce transit ridership.  And add auto dependency, pollution, smog, emissions, oil consumption, gridlock, sprawl, and more.

4945 2018-11-26 17:11:57 When did the oil industry ask for a subsidy?
4946 2018-11-26 17:11:55 I guess we need more gas from the Saudis oh wait, if we lose our relationship over the reporter we probably won't get any oil there.
4947 2018-11-26 17:11:55 Russia wants to cut off Ukrainian access to shipping. Russia started the war in Donbas because there is gas/oil in the ground that can be accessed by fracking. Russia doesn't want Ukraine to be free from Russian gas; it can be used as a tool against UA.
4948 2018-11-26 17:11:37 they're not gonna need an oil change for 6000 miles after this one

4952 2018-11-26 17:11:12 Cozying up to dictators and murderers is not in the best interests of the American People regardless of what if does for prices of oil or other goods. There is also the American Ideal of doing the right thing. This is called integrity. Which is something Donald severely lacks.

4958 2018-11-26 17:10:49 Woefully ignorant take. This government created the Canadian discount for oil by blocking all pipelines except TMX and then fumbling that one.
4959 2018-11-26 17:10:46 So if we drop him into a boiling vat of oil, it’s ok because it’s lard and you can fry your potatoes in it?
4960 2018-11-26 17:10:30 The Trudeau globalists must be cheering today but privately!All they care about is lower emissions and not one cares about the economy.They didn’t care a wink to what happened to the oil industry.They purposely bought KM pipeline to control it so no oil would flow.Butts is

4965 2018-11-26 17:09:55 Alberta produces precious little oil.  We ship raw dilbit to the Upper Midwest and Gulf Coast, because that's the decision we made decades ago.  When we were saying stuff like "let those eastern bastards freeze in the dark!"
4966 2018-11-26 17:09:54 Unfortunately they have been doing this for Alberta gas and oil for decades all for not.
4967 2018-11-26 17:09:54 BP estimates the world will run out of oil in 53.3 years at current rate of extraction.
4968 2018-11-26 17:09:46 If this was my girlfriend I would try to make her the most happiest person in the world
4969 2018-11-26 17:09:46 I am getting my oil changed & Fox news is playing in the waiting area. It's 2 cold to go outside. So, I'm stuck listening to them talking about issues at the border. It is disgusting.
4970 2018-11-26 17:09:44 Between Primary Manufacturing and Oil sector job losses and secondary job losses its not unreasonable to expect 600000 in private sector jobs have disappeared as a direct result of #Liberal and #NDP policy.
4971 2018-11-26 17:09:38 What would you propose we do? Virtue-signal over a terror apologist by losing billions in trade having oil prices shyrocket and further destabilizing the region? America is acting like the grown-up in the room on this.
4972 2018-11-26 17:09:35 Yep. As she wriggles and wriggles in the snake oil left by her predecessor. What a mess what a useless PM and an even worse Government
4973 2018-11-26 17:09:30 I think there is a sweet spot for oil around $50-70/bbl. Above that and consumers and transportation are hurting. Below it and drillers, producers, and related industries are hurting. Stability is the key to long term growth in both groups.

4976 2018-11-26 17:09:20 trump has doing NOTHING except sell snake oil and those who have consumed too much Kool aid and don’t have a humane leg to stand on, are buying that snake oil.  It will eventually ‘bite’ them in the a** .
4977 2018-11-26 17:09:18 Science side of twitter what would happen if i drank a bottle of olive oil
4978 2018-11-26 17:09:17 Thank you, President T! Very cool oil prices.
4979 2018-11-26 17:09:16 This is one of my favourites a long way to go yet
4980 2018-11-26 17:09:01 Oil.. Mystery babylon hides in the desert
4981 2018-11-26 17:08:59 On my way for another Nerve block. $4500.00. 1 vial of marijuana oil. $50.
4982 2018-11-26 17:08:50 Saudi cut production, oil prices will rise.

Simple economics, even a jr high kid could explain it to you.
4983 2018-11-26 17:08:49 We have a mad country . You can bet your last coin  the diversity of the employees is skewed .cash cow has been you and I when thieves stealing oil the cost is pushed to you and I. 4.8litres spilt  and drank by mbithis cows so no evidence can be found.we are a sick lot. Weziiiiii
4984 2018-11-26 17:08:47 its a bullshit move. If Dick “Ironheart” Cheney couldn’t extort the oil from them at the point of a gun, i cant imagine this working
4985 2018-11-26 17:08:33 Researchers who are willing to work for Oil barons and cherry-pick data that could “sort of show that a small pocket of time exists where the earth got colder, so we can extrapolate an outlier into something representative of a cycle of cooling/heating” sold their integrity.
4986 2018-11-26 17:08:30 Lmao oh yeah probably need a oil change and tune up already lol.
4987 2018-11-26 17:08:28 Will this rip have staying power?
Is the bounce in oil and a good retail weekend enough to keep it going?
4988 2018-11-26 17:08:28 We are really making moves on oil drilling, relieving our reliance on foreign suppliers.  Problem is..... We are still very involved in middle east....
4989 2018-11-26 17:08:24 I’d rather eat bricks than work for a certain oil company
4990 2018-11-26 17:08:22 Sometimes I wonder how this guy is so hard up for cash that he has to resort to selling snake oil brain pills, but then I think about how much he must spend on genetic testing before he decides which pronoun to use for each new person he meets.
4991 2018-11-26 17:08:22 are you aware that while gas may burn "clean", fugitive methane is 80times worse than CO2? I'm no fan of coal. But gas has a worse impact on climate than coal. Check out the science on it. We need to get off of ALL fossil fuels. coal, gas, oil.
4992 2018-11-26 17:08:17 Canadian Oil will bottom in next 1-2 weeks.
Margin Calls for hedge funds will force more selling.
The raising of cash in Margin Accounts will selloff general market too.
Feed on self for 1-2 weeks. Then tax loss selling finishes them off lower.
That is the shopping time for CDN
4993 2018-11-26 17:08:13 an argument can be made that oil is the most macro thing one can trade...
4994 2018-11-26 17:08:12 Aye no wanny the sunflower oil wans.
4995 2018-11-26 17:07:57 Yesterday afternoon a Corvallis woman driving on Highway 26 hit a boat anchor lying on the highway. She told police she was not able to avoid it. The anchor ripped off the car oil pan and lodged in the gas tank causing a large spill. She escaped unharmed.
4996 2018-11-26 17:07:52 The squeaky wheel gets the oil
4997 2018-11-26 17:07:47 I think it's best whisked with some oil and vinegar as a dressing, served over crispy, fresh romaine lettuce. Eat it at every meal to own the libs.
4998 2018-11-26 17:07:30 Oil's already down 33%. Should we be buying the beneficiaries of a low oil price now. American Airlines is up 23% in the last 1 1/2 months in a falling market with the fall in oil, for example!
4999 2018-11-26 17:07:23 Great article! Nobody likes slow and steady oil prices, so we continue with the boom and bust mentality. In the end, that costs the consumers and investors far more! Steady and strong allows for predictable planning and efficient deployment of capital. #energyindependence #USA
5000 2018-11-26 17:07:21 Yeh like Ian wood who talked down Scottish oil prospects
5001 2018-11-26 17:07:08 And which US president didn’t kiss the Saudi’s asses for oil?  Bush held their hands,  Obama bowed to them and so on.  Trump is trying to salvage the economy and is treating this relationship like business
5002 2018-11-26 17:07:07 Get some potassium tablets and take one a day also some mint essential oil on your temples. I looked it up for my dad.
5003 2018-11-26 17:07:06 They are clearly not done globally, though we do need to reduce (hence outdated). The question is, what is the solution for Canadian jobs? What would you do to bring them back? In a free market, lower priced oil wins.
5004 2018-11-26 17:07:05 Just watching that mission impossible film last night with the Burj Khalifa in it. Thinking about #GKP and their 3x bk deep field. I think the issue for markets is that it sounds too good to be true. It's not as if there are other massive oil fields in the Middle East 
5005 2018-11-26 17:07:04 How old is oil tank? Oil heating still cheaper to run than LPG according to Oftec. Also oil boilers have considerably longer lifespan than gas in my experience. Not sure I’ve really helped 
5006 2018-11-26 17:07:02 Cuando va hacer el día que entienda que si no le pongo gas oil a la camioneta, no funciona
5007 2018-11-26 17:06:59 Yes Sophie. All policy decisions. Same as to our oil prices. Wake up left
5008 2018-11-26 17:06:57 May need an oil change
5009 2018-11-26 17:06:55 I FORGOT I WAS WEARING MY OLD TEEN WOLF BEACON HILLS LACROSSE HOODIE AND THE OIL CHANGE GUY ASKED IF I PLAYED AAAAAAAAA

5011 2018-11-26 17:06:47 Sounds nice but it went up on speculation and came down on speculation. Not supply and demand; the world has all the oil it needs.
5012 2018-11-26 17:06:40 Get oil of cloves and put on a couple drops. It works!!!
5013 2018-11-26 17:06:39 Disturbing.

Extremely disturbing. 

One would think this government didn't really care about an oil crisis. They might also think this is...by design.

#voteThemOut
5014 2018-11-26 17:06:37 She caved to insane hard brexit lunatics all the way and let them try to negotiate their unicorn Brexit then they cried and quit when the going got tough as they are terrible politicians who have sold snake oil for to long

5016 2018-11-26 17:06:29 I see them.  Not 50% women, but they're not uncommon.
A Fort MacMurray fire refugee camping across the street drove the biggest tractor in Canada in the oil sands. She did it not from early training but b/c the $$$$ surpassed office managing.
She was small, so drywalling was out,
5017 2018-11-26 17:06:25 thanks for keeping the oil flowing and not letting the prices get out of hand
5018 2018-11-26 17:06:24 smell eucalyptus oil
5019 2018-11-26 17:06:22 Please try the cbd oil..I was a doubter too but it helps alot..I want everyone to have pain relief.  I had lived in pain even with opioids but it's really is better with the oil. I pray for comfort and less pain for you. I was close despair.

5022 2018-11-26 17:06:13 $50 dollar oil is going to put your flotilla on the rocks.

Get ready for massive unemployment in Alberta and a burst housing market in Calgary.
5023 2018-11-26 17:06:12 So, just to clarify, Alberta faces an oil crisis, and your response is Bill C69, empty rhetoric, and useless photo ops. Ontario auto industry has a crisis, and the response is “all hands on deck”? You’re in for a rude awakening come 2019.
5024 2018-11-26 17:05:56 I’m so grateful my skin can handle tea tree oil... mother Africa

5027 2018-11-26 17:05:53 Whats going on with Oil?

a) USA summer driving season oil demand is 22 MM per day,
USA fall driving season oil demand is only 20 MM per day,
There is an inventory BUILD UP of +2 MM per day

b)Iran sanctions in summer priced an oil Bullish case
waivers removed supply fears
5028 2018-11-26 17:05:45 I also use this for chapstick. The bee’s was can sometimes smell kind of bad :/ Maybe some nice smelling lavender oil would help.
5029 2018-11-26 17:05:44 @JustinTrudeau your real colours will show if you provide support now when you have turned your back on Alberta at every opportunity in the oil price crisis. This is why Ontario punted the Liberals and why the country must do the same next year. #worstPM #Libsmustgo #wakeupcanada
5030 2018-11-26 17:05:43 I worked for the Faculty of Pharmacy at a local University. The research teams did solid work, but were certainly not getting filthy rich. In fact, the only researchers I know that are rich are those who are willing to publish reports that refute bad things about smoking/oil/etc.
5031 2018-11-26 17:05:42 The Russians have been watching Designated Survivor and they thought they would ram a boat to try and get the oil price to rally. Do the math - if by causing say 200,000 of damage to an old tugboat they get $20 a barrel on oil for just a month that is worth €6 bn to them.
5032 2018-11-26 17:05:35 Not looking forward to getting an oil change my shit cost 110-120. Some one pls come fix my civic so I can get oil changes for the 30 
5033 2018-11-26 17:05:33 Finally feels like Mr. Market is trying to put in a proper bottom here with tech, financial, oil and Europe all participating in the upside $SPY

5036 2018-11-26 17:04:57 That’s why you guys are so good at what you do. You really know your onions (whale oil)!
5037 2018-11-26 17:04:50 I make my own! I melt bee’s wax pellets, a chunk of cocoa butter, and olive oil together in the microwave. Mix it well before it cools or it’ll separate. I use a couple tbsp of each and adjust the softness with more or less olive oil. I hope it works for you!
5038 2018-11-26 17:04:44 Elon, desalination which is affordable in oil rich countries creates a huge Brine problem, look at the Saudi’s... 70% of fresh water goes to Agriculture, shouldn’t Horticulture be mentioned as a solution?
5039 2018-11-26 17:04:35 We don't get that much oil anymore we produce our own. The problem is  trump  . He likes Saudi and the idea of being    KING.

5042 2018-11-26 17:04:21 @ProfOsinbajo The oil derivation to producing states should be 100% .FGN should collect tax only. We suffer the pollution alone,oil dries up,everyone goes. Ogoni clean up is still not being pursued with vigour. NIGERIA is not serious about ND development
5043 2018-11-26 17:04:14 Listen to solfeggio frequencies (youtube/spotify). Get yourself some CBD oil. I recommend @charlottesweb It’s great to have around when anxiety flares.
5044 2018-11-26 17:04:06 “We think that #oil prices will rebound heading into December and next year, however a key risk to the price is if #OPEC does not cut production,” according to Head of Energy Commodities Research Michael Cohen via @BloombergTV
5045 2018-11-26 17:03:57 So lately, I’ve been using Coconut oil for my hair moisturizer, my mouthwash, my life, my elbows and I got to say. Major improvements. #coconutoil
5046 2018-11-26 17:03:50 Honestly putting it in protective styles & using vitamin E oil. The less I touched my hair the more it grew.
5047 2018-11-26 17:03:46 From Fos-sur-Mer we will carry on by ship with crude oil and heavy pollution.
5048 2018-11-26 17:03:43 If the worst case scenario is that the SC decides that MN can put a ND coal energy tax on their citizens, then I'm okay with that. The Minnesotans like paying high taxes and we can sell our coal energy elsewhere, or leave the coal in the ground and pump the oil, which is cleaner.
5049 2018-11-26 17:03:36 Sweetheart, I know the struggle,  but please know you are important, you are loved and we are all behind you.

5051 2018-11-26 17:03:30 Boycott palm oil altogether. If anything includes it, I put it back on the shelf.
5052 2018-11-26 17:03:26 Bill Morneau needs to go roughneck for 30 days to understand the oil and gas business. Canada needs a government that supports the construction of pipelines!

5055 2018-11-26 17:03:17 How you know I worked 12 hours but can’t offer to rub my feet ?! Can oil me down ? Can’t ask me if I need anything no bath water. Just nothing ?! 
5056 2018-11-26 17:03:16 I am making an appearance on #Bloomberg/BNN Market Call tomorrow evening. One beneficiary of falling oil prices, one beaten up tech stock and one financial industry giant will be on my buy list.  See you at 6pm.
5057 2018-11-26 17:03:16  So our Province provides low oil gas prices in the US as well???

5059 2018-11-26 17:03:07 Credible economists say a lot of that had to do with the federal government at the time (Harper Cons) focus on oil.
5060 2018-11-26 17:03:06 Psalms 23:4-5  Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.
Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.
5061 2018-11-26 17:03:02 Investment in the oil patch and now the auto sector is fleeing from Canada to the USA and May thinks this the the right time to put together a team of people that will recommend more job killing policies, regulations and taxes. Shows just how out of touch the Green Party is.
5062 2018-11-26 17:02:59 The whole take a fine angle is comical. It makes no difference and if anything, has the opposite effect. This sort of thing needs to be dealt w/ by the GM/higher-ups in the organization with the NHL. Those discussions have already occurred but they obviously need to be revisited.
5063 2018-11-26 17:02:58 @fordnation this is great what you are doing for the Oshawa GM workers...what about us from the oil sands suffering the same fate?

5066 2018-11-26 17:02:40 40 yrs ago the alarm was raised about climate change. But there were other players like oil & coal companies that fought any meaningful proposals to alter the trajectory of polluting our atmosphere. We could have begun a carbon tax & Govt funding of alternate energy sources. SAD.

Can't wait to see what you say when the prices shoot back up in December as announced by OPEC
5075 2018-11-26 17:02:09 You mean the way people in Ontario and Quebec are showing compassion to the 100,000+ workers that @JustinTrudeau and LPC have deliberately put out of work in Alberta by working to destroy the oil industry and Albertas economy, that kind of compassion?
5076 2018-11-26 17:01:51 no i only drink motor oil
5077 2018-11-26 17:01:48 $20 for ALL four items OR Love inspired wall art is $7 each/$15 for all three. The Pink Zebra Candle/Oil lamp is $10. I broke the inner shade and dish to the candle/oil melt lamp and therefore can no longer use it, but it still works perfectly.

5082 2018-11-26 17:01:00 I'm watching oil start to fade & think Fed/Treasury desperate to keep rates low & willing to sacrifice any market or country including US to see that happen. Ask #Oil E&P's how MAGA is going. Matt Simmons said a real global economic recovery would come with a high oil price.

5086 2018-11-26 17:00:48 History:
Standard Oil had a 70% market share in 1906 before it was chopped up in 1911. (Rockefeller's stock value doubled due to the split.)

Ma Bell had a near perfect vertical monopoly before it was chopped in 1983.
5087 2018-11-26 17:00:48 Same Saudi Arabia we buy oil from?
5088 2018-11-26 17:00:41 Here's hoping the impending crash of oil & gas industry will break that trend.
5089 2018-11-26 17:00:33 The LPC is deeply disappointed.

But Butts is getting his wish: transformational economy away from oil towards "renewables".

Oil, cars, airplanes are so 1992. So will be employment.
5090 2018-11-26 17:00:31 The people that voted NDP in Alberta are happy the oil industry is dead.
The people that voted Trudeau are happy auto industry is dead.
It's Lefty Logic and Canada is full of people who vote stupid.

Oil has consistently disappointed bottom pickers, over, and over, and over again. I picked the top at 73. Not trying to get caught in a down move continued, although I don't discount the short squeeze potential on this thing. There are so many traders getting short. Late?
5095 2018-11-26 17:00:10 @feedme I took spor a cartoon with a bag on his head behind my mirror and he just thinks the worst because my room moved.. i turned into an illusion and danr0k in a van and the whole story of filth.. you get oil and nothing of any outer space types and layers in around the globe.
5096 2018-11-26 17:00:06 @Mista_Wizle Lmao.. Does that shock you really? You seem to have given to sensationalism.

You don't expect an oil dependent economy after crash in oil prices to feature in top growing economies. It is however now finding its feet at diversification so you'll need to be patient.
5097 2018-11-26 16:59:59 Choices: stand-alone oil is quiet but AC based, fan-forced warms quickly also AC based, Kero is quiet slight-smell but non-AC, or LP/gas-based with variations above except the insert (in fireplace) can heats lots.
5098 2018-11-26 16:59:48 Nothing like paying 97 bucks for an oil change. My welcome to Albuquerque moment.
5099 2018-11-26 16:59:45 always seemed weird to me that Andurand is "macro" when they seem to only trade oil
5100 2018-11-26 16:59:45 Saudi Arabia does not have a 'hold over' the U.S because it requires oil, the reality is the Saudi oil market heavily affects Iran, Russia, and China, thus the U.S can turn the tap on and off when it pleases to pressure these 'rogue' nations.
5101 2018-11-26 16:59:40 You are so welcome! We are super happy that you have found an oil for your specific needs!
5102 2018-11-26 16:59:33 To be fair I don’t even think any of us ever stanned Iggy. Fancy was admittedly a bop but she’s a culturally appropriating one-hit-wonder. I guess it was only a matter of time before she started shilling snake oil to stay relevant and scrape some coins.

Now *that’s* tea. 
5103 2018-11-26 16:59:32 OIL SPILL SPLITCHERS??? ARE STRAIGHT OBIES OK
5104 2018-11-26 16:59:28 11% of US oil imports comes from Saudi Arabia, which makes criticism of the Saudis off limits, but 40% comes from Canada, which is called "dishonest," "national security threat" and "economic terrorist" by the Administration and Congressional representatives.
5105 2018-11-26 16:59:23 It just took me baby oil, hair oil, 3 tubes of lash remover and 3 hours to get all my lashes off. 
5106 2018-11-26 16:59:05 A) no. It is margin-driven. B) Climate change is real. It is caused by burning fossil fuels. C) one way to buffer against fluctuations in the oil market is to buy fuel efficient cars. D) Toyota and others kicked the American car gas guzzlers asses in 2000s. Same mistake here
5107 2018-11-26 16:59:00 So where is the full employment economic plan B from Govt? The Auto & Oil Industry & supporting businesses need support and a transition plan? The old economic vision isn't working anymore.
5108 2018-11-26 16:58:58 @RickSantorum is trying to say that 90% of the world’s scientists are in cahoots to NOT take the obscene big oil money that he and all politicians take as they foolishly deny legitimate climate science. Wonder who is really in cahoots here.
5109 2018-11-26 16:58:51 I’m not a big essential oils person, but peppermint oil has menthol which eases congestion. Also, the cough drops I swear by are “Fisherman’s Friends” they’re usuallt at Walgreens I think or maybe it’s CVS. It’s in a box not a bag like most and they’re magical.

5113 2018-11-26 16:58:31 So Donald Trump says he will look the other side and let Saudi Arabia Crown Prince get away with the murder of the journalist because they have oil and money to buy guns and military equipment from the US which are being used to murder Yemens! Outrageous!

5117 2018-11-26 16:58:19 Your priority is to eliminate blue collared jobs that @cathmckenna and @cafreeland see as a problem. You wage war on manufacturing, on oil and gas, and hard working Canadians are collateral damage. They don't need your fake condolences, they need a govt that will have their back.
5118 2018-11-26 16:58:15 That’s not an answer, so you must be attempting a joke. Good one. Just so you know I was prescribed CBD oil to treat my epilepsy, so her efforts to legalize CBD + marijuana are noble. And wait, I thought conservatives LOVED freedom. Just not freedom to use plant-based medicine

5120 2018-11-26 16:58:09 He forgets that if oil prices drop too much, US producers will stop producing and lay workers off. That is what the Saudis and Russians want to happen.
5121 2018-11-26 16:58:08 He cancelled Gateway after it was approved put in s tanker ban that only affects Alberta oil and is ramming through a bill to stop all new projects yes it is his fault.
5122 2018-11-26 16:58:07 ON ARABIA: they are a strong ally for us against Iran, ISIS. S.A. helps keep oil prices down. They are moving to moderation, not Jihadis for world peace; support for Israel. No regime change. You have Ben Salmon right where you want him.
5123 2018-11-26 16:58:02 Today is very varied. Oil leasing and fracking, the Las Vegas water grab, renewable energy standards, military land seizure, rare plants and pollinators. And we'll see what else comes up.

5127 2018-11-26 16:57:50 And his policy towards SA is different than Obama’s or Bush’s how? At least he’s honest about it and the worlds need for oil. I paid 2.19 for it yesterday. It’s like a second Trump tax cut just in time for Christmas!!

5129 2018-11-26 16:57:46 How about you do NOTHING to stay consistent with Canada’s oil crisis.  Or maybe you could ask for the $ back in the loans to GM that you and @Bill_Morneau just wrote off on the backs of taxpayers. #GM #canada #cdnpoli #budget #election #jobs
5130 2018-11-26 16:57:45 But really, how is anybody surprised that as we pump gases known to trap heat into the atmosphere then the global temperature increases? At this point, it should not even be a political issue - except the oil companies need to protect their profits.
5131 2018-11-26 16:57:30 A shortsighted decision that will limit people's options for displacing oil with electricity. Owners LOVE the volt. It's a great car.

This is not the time to spend more. Try some real fiscal conservatism. #worstmayor #nenshimustgo
5139 2018-11-26 16:57:07 You know, Motor Oil is essentially oil, and people have been cooking with oil since like forever.
5140 2018-11-26 16:57:06 The cera ve is super oily (but in a good way) so that’s why I only put it on at night so when I wake up I can wash the oil away and I’m chill
5141 2018-11-26 16:57:02 are you just not reading what im writing?  there is a reason they can afford it RIGHT NOW.  Years of free market capitalism, and a ton of oil, has given this the ability.  Once that ends, which it is, so will the socialism.  And its happening now.
5142 2018-11-26 16:57:01 It’s actually the opposite. Tea tree oil does not clog pores but coconut oil do
5143 2018-11-26 16:56:49 They should fry presidential egg with executive oil abi ???

5149 2018-11-26 16:56:30 Just a reminder that the Ontario Conservatives aren't at fault for any business decisions, because they haven't been in government long enough.

BUT - they are responsible for global oil markets and the transition to winter gas dropping the pump price.
5150 2018-11-26 16:56:29 What - not taking credit for the stock market anymore? Now that its falling, you switch to claiming that you single handedly control world oil prices?

5168 2018-11-26 16:55:09 It still pains me that there's practically no small chops vendor in PH. It's easier to find crude oil, than to find small chops in this cursed place.
5169 2018-11-26 16:55:01 Girl listen. Simple as shit. Charcoal face wash (my go to is YesTo Tomato’s) then I use witch hazel and then I use Cera Ve at night for my moisturizer. I also just got introduced into blemish pads so if I feel a zit coming I put it on and it controls the oil
5170 2018-11-26 16:54:55 I am struck by how differently the loss of 2500 jobs in the auto sector is being treated than the loss of thousands of oil sector workers jobs. I wonder why that is?

5173 2018-11-26 16:54:50 If they cut off all state and federal subsidies for the oil and gas industries and gave them to renewables we might just see some of that innovation they like to talk about. Instead they throw more money at dirty energy and wonder why renewable innovation is slow.

5183 2018-11-26 16:54:14 Immigrants come for work and jobs. Over reliance on oil and embargoes on trade and borrowing has caused hyper inflation. Do some reading before sprouting anymore silly ignorant rhetoric.

5188 2018-11-26 16:53:50 I'm not expecting you or anyone else to have all the answers to these issues but the attitude that people deserve to rot because their terrible corrupt governments are more interested in maintaining oil dynasties rather than servicing their citizens is... well, shitty.
5189 2018-11-26 16:53:49 We’ll agree to disagree. I wish you were right but every piece of scientist data ( not funded by big oil) says you’re wrong. You’re still one of my favorite people on Twitter. I can tell I would like you. Maybe it’s the solid marriage advice you gave me .
5190 2018-11-26 16:53:49 Supply and demand need to be reduced in tandem. This deals with the "lower prices from lower demand" problem and physically prevents oil from being extracted.
5191 2018-11-26 16:53:30 that's all in the federal minister's court, ford can only make that same request, which he did right away.   they did  it Alberta for the oil workers. and they are giving 600 million for journalists. maybe they could  600 million worth of gm cars to convince them to stay
5192 2018-11-26 16:53:28 Re Oshawa GM plant closing. Ottawa & Ontario could sure use the Alberta Oil Export money right now. 
No Energy East Pipeline 
No new rail oil cars built
Tens of Billions of dollars lost to Canadians.

5199 2018-11-26 16:53:09 Laughable that the Russians felt war threats from a few Ukrainian navy ships. The Russians need to make trouble praying on smaller weak nations to make themselves feel good. Without oil and gas, they are one big Lada factory and oligarchs stealing from their people.
5200 2018-11-26 16:53:01 "House of sand" refers to the complexity of figuring out what markets would do in the face of such policies. Making it harder to extract resources also keeps oil in the ground. If we stop leasing on Federal lands that oil is in the ground and will stay there.

5217 2018-11-26 16:51:28 They consume most of it/ keep in reserves/ the lower the better. They actually had a 40 year ban on oil exports that ended in 2016.

5219 2018-11-26 16:51:19 And... Is selling guns for oil to Saudi terrorists really lawful? Is killing people in sovereign nations that don't want Petro dollar standards in banking lawful? It depends on the deregulation to make it lawful.
5220 2018-11-26 16:51:06 I had Bulletproof Coffee this morning and I guess the MCT Oil fought all those processed carbs I ate for thanksgiving and bawh gawly ole mighty Jesus Christ our savior did I poop
5221 2018-11-26 16:50:58 Lmao does your car have a big puddle of oil underneath it?
5222 2018-11-26 16:50:56 And the BULL SHIT continues. While cities like Ottawa, Toronto, Montreal, Quebec City and many others across Canada are dumping raw sewage in our lakes and rivers; daily; 10s of billions of gallons. Mining and oil companies dumping high corrosive tailings in our water ways. B.S.
5223 2018-11-26 16:50:46 Exercise and rhodiola oil stop me from killing you all every day.
5224 2018-11-26 16:50:43 I'm replaying #Shenmue again & see that the outside of the Hazuki residence has two motor oil canisters & then one in the kitchen (wtf) & I'm thinking why is this nightmare following me in video games too?
5225 2018-11-26 16:50:41 The Norvegians have oil, the Swiss have their banks ...
5226 2018-11-26 16:50:39 Por eso los esfuerzos de #TRUMP para tumbar el $OIL
5227 2018-11-26 16:50:37 I have fibromyalgia. I have other issues as well. Until recently I used opiates to get me through my 12 hr work days. I am now using cbd oil ..it helps so much. No opiates now. Still have lightning bolts but pain is better . Blessed
5228 2018-11-26 16:50:24 you're going to be begging for those missing billions  of dollars of oil revenue from deep discounts to our product. The blunt truth is that fat cat lifestyles in Ontario Quebec have been supported by the natural resource economy of western Canada.
5229 2018-11-26 16:50:22 Virgin oil or extra virgin oil?

5233 2018-11-26 16:50:00 @GM so... I have a 2011 Chevy Equinox that I purchased used- I've been having oil consumption issues (as you well know). I've been to the dealership 4 times now to have the same thing fixed- now my warranty is past the allotted miles & your bulletin/extended warranty expired...
5234 2018-11-26 16:49:56 i still remember how she looked to me when i first saw her. an oil painting in real life i swear. so radiant.
5235 2018-11-26 16:49:56 Opinion: The USA and China might supply itself with fuels which are gas to liquid processed from natural gas extracted in coal. Crude oil importation will likely stop. @realDonaldTrump @KingSalman @CGTNOfficial @ChinaSPIC @PentagonPresSec
5236 2018-11-26 16:49:55 Can we criticize your governments policy that explicitly rejected a child who ended up dead on a beach? That was your Ministry, actually. Also, focusing on oil and gas so much over your 10 year tenure looks really intelligent ar this point.
5237 2018-11-26 16:49:53 Coal mines aren’t opening. There is almost zero growth on that industry. Maybe your talking about new oil extraction and refinery plants, plus new pipelines.
5238 2018-11-26 16:49:51 Ok so does he get blamed when oil prices go up?
5239 2018-11-26 16:49:44 *Goes to get oil change*

“Yeah, so while we were changing your oil, we noticed a couple things wrong. Basically your whole car is falling apart. Other than that, everything seems to be good”
5240 2018-11-26 16:49:14 Мне как-то всегда было страшно, но с этого всего, стало ещё страшнее. Типа, если это есть где-то, значит оно может быть и здесь. Да и вообще, если так задуматься, мы умереть можем то в любую секунду... И это мозг срывает

5245 2018-11-26 16:48:52 Rumours of cheap oil deals and loans of up to $2 bill to central bank  @IgnitionUK - Tunisians know they need that economic boost but still protesting MbS as antipathetic to Arab spring movement begun in Tunisia 
5246 2018-11-26 16:48:46 Yet, he'll still take credit for a global drop in oil prices.

The point is, he's dishonest...
5247 2018-11-26 16:48:42 Oil industry smashed what next
5248 2018-11-26 16:48:29 This is fine while oil price is low, however once it starts to climb (which at some stage it will for a finite resource), they will regret not having a domestic compact car industry.
5249 2018-11-26 16:48:15 Castor Oil or Coconut Oil?
5250 2018-11-26 16:48:10 They are pretending at Caliphate, while carrying out measures against other Muslims. The only thing they have is oil and the 2 Holy Cities. They are Janitors, of those cities, not the "head" of Islam. Those cities belong to all Muslims, they have disrespected Muslims for too long
5251 2018-11-26 16:48:09 I used my drunk elephant face oil to remove the last eyelash extensions I had on this morning  (best way to do it if you have a few stragglys) and my god my eyes have been SO SOFT AND SILKY all day ahah

5254 2018-11-26 16:47:49 How many minorities did you nominate? How about we get a senator that cares about all people and climate change! You could do that John but that requires you to not be a puppet of big oil, stop excepting their money, to have a backbone, compassion! Truth shall come out! Trump 
5255 2018-11-26 16:47:48 There are over 100,000 unemployed oil&gas workers because of your lack of action. How are you helping those families?
Never seen you make a statement about them.
5256 2018-11-26 16:47:47 And oil sector it’s probably the most difficult to understand.
Wasn’t lower before the tax cuts?
And after tax cuts we’re paying a higher gasoline price.
This looks like Trump caused this price hike and now wants to claim credit for “lower the barrel price”
5257 2018-11-26 16:47:30 Can’t use both especially if the pepper spray is oil based. Police and Military don’t use stun guns because you have to get up close and personal. They use Tasers
5258 2018-11-26 16:47:29 i tried gentle magic a few years ago (i have sensitive combination skin) and the result was far from ideal :/ lately aqueous cream and tea tree oil face washes have helped!! all the best beautiful, these processes can be so taxing

5260 2018-11-26 16:47:19 Look up Genie Oil And Gas...makes even more sense
5261 2018-11-26 16:47:18 Did you know that you can reuse our small essential oil bottles? I love to use them as cane toppers in the garden!
5262 2018-11-26 16:47:07 The last few years seen some of lowest oil field discoveries globally
5263 2018-11-26 16:47:01 Apparently the 'liberal' press is more important to this country than the oil and gas sector. I mean...how has that ever benefited us.
5264 2018-11-26 16:46:57 Gov can barely keep up with healthcare and people want it to nationalize a car plant? Venezuela nationalized oil to invent jobs. Collapsed the entire industry. Chipping their starving citizens now to keep them from revolting.

5271 2018-11-26 16:46:27 Back to the days when tobacco companies could find a tiny minority of scientists to back up their claims smoking didnt cause cancer. Oil companies are now doing the same, and in America they seem to be winning.
5272 2018-11-26 16:46:24 When you come to your mechanic for a $40 oil change and end up spending $400 <<<<<  who needs brakes? 
5273 2018-11-26 16:46:15 Those little mechanic shops that do it way cheaper. Especially if you buy your own oil
5274 2018-11-26 16:46:11 Why does SD-WAN read like Snake Oil to me?  Seems like another fad product in the shape of a Bad Idea. So you let your ISP/WAN-provider people be in charge of all traffic with zero visibility, zero accountability, and zero security (network people aren't security people).

5277 2018-11-26 16:45:46 I haven't found anything that REALLY picks me up tbh. I take CBD oil which helps the anxiety a whole lot, helps me see things with a little more perspective than feeling completely lost, I'd say that's the closest thing I've found to an organic help

5279 2018-11-26 16:45:33 They thought it was an air lock but, it’s been heat cycled quite a bit now. They say they’ve bled it too. It might be coming from the header tank but, the fluid seems to be pooling towards the bell housing. Exactly where the oil was coming from.

My gut said air, not convinced

5282 2018-11-26 16:45:30 Thank you @kidkanevil for that set in Moscow. it was a discovery. You captured my heart surprisingly responded to this sound, filled with soft, sparkling details and condensed bass lines that did not interfere, as water & oil. so I think you have a beautiful beautiful mind ..
5283 2018-11-26 16:45:29 Sorry! I make it up to you one day with a foot massage with hot oil.
5284 2018-11-26 16:45:26 I'm suggesting that people need options. Closing Oshawa will mean the loss of 15-20 thousand jobs incl spinoffs.  Some of those people might want to head West & work in oil & gas. Or others in Ont freeing up jobs for displaced auto workers. But let's have the option available!
5285 2018-11-26 16:45:11 Quit being a victim. I worked as a female engineer in oil and gas, tough, but doable. Don't whine, Work!

5288 2018-11-26 16:44:59 Trudeau was in Calgary on Thursday talking to oil and gas, so yes, we hear about it. 

Trudeau used tax payer dollars to by a pipeline that the private sector was going to build, if the government stopped changing the approval process. KM was going to sue and so Trudeau paid.
5289 2018-11-26 16:44:55 @JoelOsteen Then oil filter busted when went to give out human rights cards. I had put four courts of oil in the car to get home after being in a business for about 15 minutes. I still have the oil filter. I left for Texas four days later to see Joel Osteen to give him a letter.

5293 2018-11-26 16:44:30 Hi Melinda. This is a really important issue and we’ve been driving industry-wide change for more than 15 years. We’re on track to meet our goal of sourcing 100% physically certified palm oil by the end of 2019.
5294 2018-11-26 16:44:29 Silly Brian, kids can't tell the difference between canola oil and 100% Pure Peanut Oil.
5295 2018-11-26 16:44:29 in a sense by destroying the oil and gas industry in the west he will have  inadvertently started to destroy Quebec since western canada funds Quebec and their programs & subsidies
5296 2018-11-26 16:44:23 RT @drwillcole: Medium-chain triglycerides from healthy fats like coconut oil are quickly absorbed by your body to boost energy and increases ketone levels.

5298 2018-11-26 16:44:15 Using your logic, since Oil and Gas companies get hundreds of billions more than green tech companies, there is more reason, and therefore it is the case (again, your logic) that man-made climate change IS an issue and we're being fooled into thinking it isn't.

5300 2018-11-26 16:44:07 People are finally admitting climate change is real and what’s the plan? Stop throwing trash everywhere so animals stop dying? No. Stop using unnecessary amounts of coal and oil in exchange for cheaper alternatives? No. BLOCK THE SUN. yes.
5301 2018-11-26 16:44:00 It is not Trump ruled world, but who is manage Trump rule the world. You must look that in that order. More market share! more production for US and Sudi's against Russia. Maybe Russia, SA and USA get same train. And broken others production. As you know we come to end for OIL
5302 2018-11-26 16:43:59 Help needed in the UK, please. I want to make this but not sure about what sugar to use (caster?) and as I can’t readily get canola oil, is vegetable oil a good substitute?
5303 2018-11-26 16:43:55 The oil and gas industry is the heart and soul of Alberta and a lot more than 2500 jobs have evaporated under your leadership, what are you doing about them?
5304 2018-11-26 16:43:48 It was just my family + in-laws and we had to leave that afternoon so I only cooked a breast, but it was really good. Just hit it with a lot of salt all over 24 hours before, herb butter under the skin and good olive oil on the skin. Good flavor, nice and juicy.

5309 2018-11-26 16:43:21 Why yes I do understand the interconnectiveness of the world. That’s why I mentioned the cost to the worlds poorest countries who need cheap energy.  Putting major restrictions on oil production and coal effects them first. That too is interconnectedness
5310 2018-11-26 16:43:19 We were involved prior to that selling war supplies. Japan invaded French indochina to block imports into China. The US responded by freezing Japanese assets including an embargo on oil exports into Japan. Japan still being expansionist and with low oil supplies decided to/

You should also add that you make a suggestion in light of Guyana already being in debt to Exxon mobil— before any revenue from oil has even been made— again b/c of neo-imperialism which benefit white foreign owned corps

5317 2018-11-26 16:42:48 2018 was the most volatile year for financial markets since the financial crisis, and 2019 looks unlikely to be different. The large moves in oil in recent days are just the latest in a long string of high sigma moves in the markets.

5322 2018-11-26 16:42:33 Swalwell, you are a snake oil salesman and a grifter. You represent all that is poisonous in our society. You are targeting the low information, emotional voter with your propaganda. Knowingly posting one of the few women who put their kids at risk is disgusting! #Karma
5323 2018-11-26 16:42:25 And you are blaming these children who are scared and have nothing instead of asking why a state like Texas with such a large surplus from oil cannot provide free education for all kids, you are aware how bad public schools are in Texas right? That’s not an immigrant problem

And the soon to come demise of oil and gas is grossly exaggerated.

5329 2018-11-26 16:42:15 Settle down. The oil patch has never asked for a bailout, but there are a lot of "conservatives" who want Ottawa to throw money out there, the same way they've done with other industries.
5330 2018-11-26 16:42:08 Perhaps this is why people should fight to death for control of their resources, demand pricing structure transparency, and go block chain from now on with business contracts.

For all the problems African countries have (blood diamonds/oil/etc), what countries do they plunder?

5340 2018-11-26 16:41:12 Then why hasn't every other oil-reliant country also collapsed in spectacular fashion? Reliance on oil is but one factor, unrealistic Government spending and nationalization of key industries (socialism) are the main factors.
5341 2018-11-26 16:41:09 Snake oil salesman tRump.
5342 2018-11-26 16:41:06 Falling oil prices seem to be weighing on breakevens lowering US nominal yields globally which are the highest in the G10. On a global scale could weigh on the USD disproportionately from the perspective of interest rate differentials. We view falling oil prices to be USD bearish
5343 2018-11-26 16:40:59 Collective conscience?! You would let anyone walk all over you, allow your country to be invaded by mobs insistent they are entitled. You are the snake oil salesman. We have dignity you would sell your soul for measly power. Pathetic!

5349 2018-11-26 16:40:39 Oil companies @Total, @Shell, and @BP_plc developing joint #humanrights questionnaire for suppliers, will conduct joint audits, and will share non-sensitive information re the audits. #compliance #bizhumanrights #UNForumBHR
5350 2018-11-26 16:40:36 Fair play Heidi good on ya :)
5351 2018-11-26 16:40:32 Ayeeee sana oil
5352 2018-11-26 16:40:23 美少年は今日も可愛いなー！
5353 2018-11-26 16:40:23 Oil tanks, Russia provokes Ukraine, oil goes up.  Pretty standard playbook, so obvious...
5354 2018-11-26 16:40:20 This. Nobody goes into geology for the $$$, unless of course you work for oil companies. They're the only ones who pay lucratively. Which I'm sure is only out of the goodness of their hearts.
5355 2018-11-26 16:40:14 How do you use the saffron with the eggs? Putting it in the pan with oil and then adding the eggs?
5356 2018-11-26 16:40:05 いや…ちょ、やめろっ！耳からはさすがに油飲めないから！
5357 2018-11-26 16:40:04 Ladies, if he:

- never calls when he says he will
- spends all his time on the battlefield
- treats wounds with dressings instead of hot oil
- invents rad prostheses

He's not your man, he's sixteenth-century surgical pioneer, Ambroise Pare.

5359 2018-11-26 16:40:00 Slight tip for anyone who deals with anxiety especially at night. Put a few drops of lavender oil on your pillow. I’ve been doing it for two weeks. And I sleep so much better. It may help you too.
5360 2018-11-26 16:39:59 CHICKEN OIL
5361 2018-11-26 16:39:59 No rice...can actually eat u with only oil.
5362 2018-11-26 16:39:56 Like you helped Alberta oil workers? Like you helped Ab And BC fire victims? Like you helped veterans? Like you helped our homeless? Like you helped low income seniors? Poor GM workers then.
5363 2018-11-26 16:39:47 Nope. 1st gulf war was just & paid for w/ oil $ cos Bush sr negotiated w/ the Saudis to save them from Saddam & Kuwaitis were grateful we saved their country. Bush jr/neoCons went for greed purposes, negotiated nothing w/ others & thought they'd get oil $, but US paid 2 trillion.
5364 2018-11-26 16:39:38 Oil prices change on a regular basis. And no it is not like a big tax cut.
5365 2018-11-26 16:39:34 Alberta is in dire straights. It’s nothing to do with pipelines to ship more oil at an ever decreasing price. The answer is to bight the bullet and force the building of upgraders in Fort McMurray by reducing the export of crude like the US did 1974-2015.
5366 2018-11-26 16:39:33 GM just announced 15 percent of it's global workforce and plants are closing, falling oil prices kill jobs.

5368 2018-11-26 16:39:28 Funny thing though.  Every time Kosk plays we're rocking and rolling and on the way to the Pacific lead, and every time Talbot plays the coaches suck, the GM sucks, the roster sucks, the refs suck, and the Oil are a disaster.  Just go with Kosk for 9 out of 10 game stretch, eh?
5369 2018-11-26 16:39:28 I am sure the Russian people don't. Appears to me that the corruption from greed from oil money knows no national boundary and has no allegiance to anything but gain.
5370 2018-11-26 16:39:27 Our governments love Middle East oil.....
but nobody likes Middle Eastern people.....
Name me one country that is content with their presence.....
Not just a stray kook, here & there.... but an entire country or even a single city and all its citizens.
5371 2018-11-26 16:39:21 good smelling oil like peppermint
5372 2018-11-26 16:39:15 For now...We'll end up having to sacrifice another life in tribute to keep oil prices down..

We pay in flesh now...
5373 2018-11-26 16:39:15 Stop using palm oil full stop.
5374 2018-11-26 16:39:03 we only nationalize oil pipelines
5375 2018-11-26 16:38:56 You said it!
5376 2018-11-26 16:38:55 USA is still borrowing to develop infrastructures with debt profile hoovering $21tr. Uk debt to GDP is 87% counting.  We cannot industrialise Nig. with oil money from Niger delta.  It's too meagre.  With popul.of 200m, Nig. needs more than $2trillions US dollars to create jobs.
5377 2018-11-26 16:38:55 "FREE"   advice for your health ! Take Flax seed oil everyday because it     has more omega 3's than omega 6's.  Omega 3's  inhibit inflammation,   whereas omega 6's increase inflammation.  Fish and fish oils contain   more omega 3's but they may also contain mercury or radiation
5378 2018-11-26 16:38:51 It would be interesting if a Unionist could come clean as to why they want to save the Union:
There is more oil to be stolen.
Need a dumping ground for nuclear weapons.
Desire to hold on the last bit of Empire.
Source of cannon fodder.

5379 2018-11-26 16:38:50 Any comment on the subsidization of Canada's oil and gas industry?
5380 2018-11-26 16:38:38 boil or ferment it. YouTube will help you

•rinse rice 
•put more water than usual boil it and use the excess water
Or
•rinse
•ferment rice in jar of water at room temp for 24 hours
•dilute with water a little & I put a little oil in mine to rid the sour fermented smell
5381 2018-11-26 16:38:36 Trudeau/Butts destroyed the Oil and Gas Industry. Now doing same for the rest of Canada. Bad policies, bad government!
5382 2018-11-26 16:38:35 And wearing body oil. Girls love to look beautiful so they go that extra mile to get that look they want. There’s nothing to hide. In fact  it takes a girl who feels pretty to rock the makeup.
5383 2018-11-26 16:38:22 I am so close to being done with the game! I just did the oil raid with the Indians.
5384 2018-11-26 16:38:22 I wasn't addressing straws, just climate change. Facetious he may have been, but his tweets show he doesn't believe in it. I would argue blind faith is believing the 3% of scientists who don't believe in it along with the politicians who benefit from the oil and gas industry.
5385 2018-11-26 16:38:14 Every single pen trash except Euerka....zero additives pure cannabis oil...I hate pens with a passion but euerka ona whole other level
5386 2018-11-26 16:38:13 There is no scientific disagreement... 97% of all scientists have done all of the work...it is a FACT...the 3% who LIE are owned by the oil & gas Lobby and that is also a FACT! 
It does not matter how many of your Russia Sock Puppets upvote your lies. The whole world is against U
5387 2018-11-26 16:38:07 Nothing to do with the tax cut. It has to do with buyer preferences, improved fuel efficiency and cheaper oil (making fueling larger vehicles less costly) many consumers perceive trucks and cross-overs as preferable and safer - models that are not made at these plants.
5388 2018-11-26 16:38:04 I just bought some castor oil and biotin. This "beard" will prosper one day lol
5389 2018-11-26 16:38:04 Actually, that crossed my mind. Hoses.  They should also hose down the fences with vegetable oil. Less expenses.

5391 2018-11-26 16:37:50 Saudi Arabia is oil rich,not nessacirily rich from capitalism,also they are wahabi extremists
5392 2018-11-26 16:37:48 It was just a stage set any way; they can’t commit to stopping the problem, their economic model is based on it. Time to divide the company ala AT&T and Standard Oil 100 years ago.
5393 2018-11-26 16:37:48 "You got that wrong way round Dafty Scot trade £69 bl plus not counting oil we get back less than half"

You're saying the SNP are lying to make our situation look worse than it is?

Right-oh, I don't think I'll be drinking whatever you're on.
5394 2018-11-26 16:37:45 Coconut oil appreciation post 
I’ve been applying it every night for the last 3 weeks and my skin feels so good. Perfect winter season skincare, yes yes !
5395 2018-11-26 16:37:40 Sis :( Witch hazel + tea tree oil.
5396 2018-11-26 16:37:37 Scheduled my oil change  getting my life together one step at a time
5397 2018-11-26 16:37:30 Personally, I love the life. Simple, self-reliant. These pple are happy & mostly healthy, eating off the land, breathing clean, fresh air everyday compared to all the smoke & industrial fumes of city life.  Cooking oil is luxury 4them. Nzungu paguyo at no cost, cabbage rinedovi:)
5398 2018-11-26 16:37:28 @AppleTreeHonda1 at your dealership for an oil change. Asked for a brake inspection and was told that if I didn’t pay for a tire rotation that they would have to charge me to look at the brakes thoroughly. What in the world!?! #BadBusiness
5399 2018-11-26 16:37:21 This really is something. I am a structural engineer. I was working on preparing a complex model and I had to select a particularly complex set of surfaces on a 3D model to apply oil cooling effects. I struggled all through Friday with no success. I called it a day and left.
5400 2018-11-26 16:37:17 Don’t forget those in the oil industry!!!!
5401 2018-11-26 16:37:14 @oil_ii1339 มาเล่นกันเถอะๆ
5402 2018-11-26 16:37:14 Doctor suggested putting coconut oil on b4 shower for dry skin. Baby tooshie soft so far, hoping not to be broken out like a 15 year old boy later.  If you hang out with me you might get a sudden craving for an Almond Joy.
5403 2018-11-26 16:37:09 It’s shocking that Cadbury’s ,knowingly, uses Palm oil, and justifies using it! I’m not buying any of their products, boycotting Cadbury, saving the orangutans,their habitat.
Thank you!
#boycottcadburys #saveorangutans
5404 2018-11-26 16:36:56 and they have a ton of oil.

Émile Bernard Tschumi
Oil, oilstick on paper
5406 2018-11-26 16:36:53 i like how an American is trying to tell a Slavic guy what's best for my home country; i like how you're defending a guy that, within the first FY of his term, raised oil prices 60x over, who plays the victim card to EU and UN while his people fight amongst themselves
5407 2018-11-26 16:36:53 Somebody come get my oil changed
5408 2018-11-26 16:36:50 L'oil era andato in bolla subito prima, e quella più che una recessione fu un infarto dell'economia globale,per cui in un certo senso fa storia a se. In ogni caso sicuram. il calo delle attese di crescita ha un ruolo in qs crash, ma IMHO altri fattori hanno avuto ruoli importanti
5409 2018-11-26 16:36:49 I woke up this morning and gave myself enough time to do a hair and face mask, exfoliated every inch of my body, plus i smothered myself in lavender body oil i feel like an unstoppable KWEEN today and it’s not even noon yet.
5410 2018-11-26 16:36:44 Gotta keep Ah good beard oil

5412 2018-11-26 16:36:31 They should be driving EVs. They also should just refine the dirty oil sands right in Alberta but that makes too much sense.
5413 2018-11-26 16:36:22 TWO POINTS:

1.) often oil prices fall because of a weakening global economy...you know, “supply and demand”. Did they teach that at Wharton?

2.) Putin must be pissed since Russia’s economy is all about oil. You better be careful. He’s not always nice.
5414 2018-11-26 16:36:17 Rich in gold , timber ,cocoa, oil etc
5415 2018-11-26 16:36:10 Agree. Either/or framing presents a false narrative. As @trevortombe has pointed out in the past the optimal emissions level is not 0. Trevor has shown in past analysis that the implied carbon price of lower oil production thru avoiding pipelines is 1500-2000/t. Is that the goal?
5416 2018-11-26 16:36:10 The importance of the oil sector in the US has been steadily increasing though with US oil production among the highest in the world. This suggests that falling oil prices may also weigh on US investment spending and growth, further narrowing growth differentials.
5417 2018-11-26 16:36:07 Your oil spits low octane levels?  Not sure what you mean. Low gravity/high asphaltines?
5418 2018-11-26 16:35:56 Could it be that luntz, shine, hannity, trump, all paid by fox to dissemble and create doubt in an already mentally-infirm population, are the tip of the fascist spear with gop, big oil, defense contractors making up the rest? Lunt doth protest too much
5419 2018-11-26 16:35:56 I have been asked to gather the foliage for OHs flower arranging class this evening. I fear the responsibility may be too great however in good faith I venture forth to locate a quantity of small size castor oil leaves #outofmydepth
5420 2018-11-26 16:35:51 Gas prices and oil production would tend to differ.
5421 2018-11-26 16:35:43 Fuck the past few weeks you’d really think it was a competition $BTC vs $OIL
5422 2018-11-26 16:35:37 Three separate fields.  One was 35,765, 24,320 and the last was 21,384.  Way above recommended plant population to average to below average.  Not sure what the oil is yet.   Makes me wonder what else we need to look at.  These were 455's and 458's not 450's.  I'll have more later
5423 2018-11-26 16:35:34 what U think is fueling this rally, its the black Friday business, people are doing the spending part, now they have to pay for it, also relief rally that oil is recovering, many former lucrative businesses went insolvent on that break to 50
5424 2018-11-26 16:35:32 Meanwhile, the count of US oil rigs in operation are only 3 off their high for 2018, which was last week.
5425 2018-11-26 16:35:29 Oh, I see the oil refineries are casting some major shade over The Galleria, The Heights and SW Houston this morning!!  :)
5426 2018-11-26 16:35:29 I've been taking CBD oil (100mg per day) for the last few weeks, and it seems like it made my carpal tunnel pain completely subside.  That is a huge dose though.  Super expensive at $5/day 
Better than popping ibuprofen like candy I suppose.
5427 2018-11-26 16:35:21 Big oil pays him & other politicians to say that.
5428 2018-11-26 16:35:16 Falling oil prices have complex complications for the global economy. Falling oil prices reduce production costs and improve the terms of trade for oil importers, thereby being supportive for global growth.

5430 2018-11-26 16:35:08 It is frequently mentioned in war diaries - and those of the Divisional and Corps Adjutants often provide interesting technical detail re the oil and incidence of trench foot.
5431 2018-11-26 16:35:04 One of the most disgusting things I saw in my life were a bunch of Columbia undergrads—seemingly from across the political spectrum—standing on College Walk in early March 2003 for a pro-Iraq War rally. I’ll never forget one sign: “blood for oil is the better deal.”
5432 2018-11-26 16:34:59 I’m not gone leave BG until 1 dealing with this oil change.
5433 2018-11-26 16:34:57 Spartaco non aveva in debito pubblico del 130%del oil e la necessità di pagare tre milioni di dipendenti pubblici è dieci milioni di pensioni, coglionate da Grillini
5434 2018-11-26 16:34:52 It amazes me that the Federal Government in Canada, has come out with support for Gm workers, however western oil workers are ignored. #timetoseperate?
5435 2018-11-26 16:34:41 with @gmbutts at the helm the liberal govt is heavily invested in going away from "carbon based economy". We don't need cars, we don't need oil, perhaps we don't need transportation and/or manufacturing. You voted for those people Canada. You play defense for them @althiaraj
5436 2018-11-26 16:34:40 MSJs #AtMedill going to the Big Ten Championship game on Dec. 1: let me know if you're interested in having media access for the weekend, which includes a panel on women in sports, a tour of Lucas Oil Stadium, a coach's press conference, and BTN tailgate show with @AWSM_NU
5437 2018-11-26 16:34:33 And those oil prices which I'm told are *like* a tax cut!
5438 2018-11-26 16:34:29 Bring him to OIL COUNTRY
5439 2018-11-26 16:34:19 Start your week off with some high quality #CBD oil, come on by and see us!
5440 2018-11-26 16:34:12 Just some oil...illuminate that beautiful Sunkissed tan you already have. Make it glow...
5441 2018-11-26 16:33:39 LOL. Thank youuuuu 
It's that 'I am almost done with school and can finally get my black ass to Naija' glow and Vitamin E oil 
5442 2018-11-26 16:33:39 Pots and kettles , and so so deluded to top it off..
Bush caused wars for no real reason so he could grab the oil on Iraq ..
Chemical weapons my ass and you bought it
5443 2018-11-26 16:33:27 Well for me black soap cleanses my skin, coconut oil hydrates it, and shea butter keeps it smooth. So far I’m getting hella mixed reviews. To each their own though because of the many different skin types
5444 2018-11-26 16:33:14 I popped 2 pills of THC oil yesterday and it never hit me up until this morning when I woke up lmfao wayyyyyyy IM AT WORK TRYNA FUNCTION
5445 2018-11-26 16:32:55 Which is what? 6 bottles of palm oil and 3 goats?
5446 2018-11-26 16:32:42 My bf woke up extremely sick early Sunday morning. So I had him in the kitchen at 6am making him inhale tea tree oil steam  I’m already knowing what type of mom ima be 
5447 2018-11-26 16:32:40 Yeah, that's uncouth, but I thought it was one of the Republican selling points of the war in 2002, that they would pay for it with oil. No? So, for neocon scumbags, this is just good follow through.
5448 2018-11-26 16:32:39 Have you ever tried CBD Oil?
5449 2018-11-26 16:32:34 I think I'ma wait til Wednesday for this oil change.
5450 2018-11-26 16:32:32 That’s awesome! Girl I slept like a baby and I use essential oils to help and you can use them on baby just some aren’t there best I would totally look into to it there’s a oil for anything colds allgeries sleep relax focus up lifting and glad you got some sleep girl
5451 2018-11-26 16:32:29 So they must not be permitted to flare it?  Would make more sense to flare some in order to sell some.  That is greed/competition pushed over a cliff.  I know Oil gets thrown in there as well.  No doubt.  Thank Tom
5452 2018-11-26 16:32:16 @enterprisecares My current rental leaked oil all over my garage floor. The vehicle was swapped out to be taken to a repair shop, but now I’m left with oil everywhere! Huge hassle for something that’s not my fault..
5453 2018-11-26 16:32:13 I know about the tree tea oil , are you gonna be dreading it yourself?
5454 2018-11-26 16:32:12 High-seas clash is straight out of Putin's playbook . The E.U. needs a leader with a REAL backbone unlike Merkel who keeps playing "footsie" with Putin that allows his aggressions on Ukraine & even agreeing on a "stream" oil pipeline undercutting Ukraine. GET RID OF Merkel @ EU.
5455 2018-11-26 16:32:07 The argument is correct but that chart is very out of date.  The costs of Canadian oil sands and US light oil fracking have fallen dramatically.
5456 2018-11-26 16:32:06 We expect further USD weakness. CAD should remain a relative underperformer in the environment of a weaker USD, driven by the fall in oil prices. Weaker oil prices are unlikely to do the USD any favors, we stay USD bearish accordingly.
5457 2018-11-26 16:32:03 That’s what I’d hope too mate. Tbf I was thinking 250p by Christmas with the right news and price action on oil. Need Trump to play ball a little and stop being a petulant kid 
5458 2018-11-26 16:32:02 Why would I send a friend a product containing palm oil? Sustainable palm oil is a misnomer. Chocolate should not include palm oil. Your products are destroying habitats of orangutans and livelihoods of people.
5459 2018-11-26 16:32:00 Thanks I was worried, who really cares that gm is closing it’s doors and Canada can get any of its oil / lumber / grain / Dairy on a far market price cause of a shit head running the country, have a great wedding.
5460 2018-11-26 16:31:58 Some of the women's stories I've heard over the years from oil and gas are horrific.
5461 2018-11-26 16:31:49 เราเคยเป็นนะ แต่มันหายเอง มันเป็นเพราะว่าเรานอนทับแผลตอนเจาะมาใหม่ๆ ให้ในเน็ตให้ใช้tea tree oil ทาที่คีลอยด์ ลองเอาไปทำดูนะ ปรึกษาเราได้

5463 2018-11-26 16:31:39 Don’t forget to oil your cuticles today girlies
5464 2018-11-26 16:31:34 How to have clear skin on social media; 
Step 1: wash your face
Step 2: apply plenty oil 
Step 3: go under the sun and take selfies
Step 4: edit pic on Facetune and upload. 
5465 2018-11-26 16:31:30 @ericswalwell (unfortunately) is my Congressman. He has a history of lying as witnessed by his false peddling of the Russian Collusion knowing quite well nothing was there.  He and his weak father (@AdamSchiff) are professional snake oil salesmen.
5466 2018-11-26 16:31:30 Because put in was long oil last week s close
5467 2018-11-26 16:31:21 Saudi Arabia tortures, murders journalist working for American newspaper, residing in the U.S. because he spoke truth against Saudi government. Trump says he has no problem because of oil (we get much more oil from Canada). Trump lies about his business connections to Saudis.
5468 2018-11-26 16:31:10 Feeling accomplished today, decided I better look at changing the oil in my daily car, well it has been 50,000 miles since the last. In comparison the BMW has had three in 8,000 miles #blacktreacle
5469 2018-11-26 16:31:01 1) The world is all messed up. So you have to look at what institutions have the most power. Who has the most control? They are to blame. The top four most powerful and influential entities that are screwing up the world are: The oil industry is definitely number one or two...^
5470 2018-11-26 16:31:00 I I would have been aware PM was coming I would have been protesting. I voted for Trudeau- expected more!!!  Not just oil.  We have an Indian, not Canadian company, issuing Canadian visas-we have thousands of Sikhs using the refugee loophole to get access into Canada! I am angry!
5471 2018-11-26 16:30:51 • U.S. fires tear gas into Mexico to repel migrants, closes border gate for several hours - 
• Saudi Arabia oil pumping at record high as Trump raises pressure – 
• Euro zone lost some growth momentum but oil prices help says ECB -
5472 2018-11-26 16:30:51 so during the blizzard yesterday the wife and i went for a cruise on the gravel roads in the new truck
found some oil tanks 100 yds off the road
went an parked behind them
and did stuff that teenagers would do
:DDD
5473 2018-11-26 16:30:49 Sorry but we refuse to buy any Cadbury products until you do better on reducing the use of palm oil
5474 2018-11-26 16:30:42 Coconut oil on my whole body, lavender scents on every stitch of my clothing, olive oil on every coil on my head .....I’m black 
5475 2018-11-26 16:30:35 Have you ever tried CBD Oil? I know people that have been helped by it. It helps reduce nerve pain and inflammation.
5476 2018-11-26 16:30:34 How was your #BlackFriday weekend? What cheap goodies did you buy? Don't worry if you missed out on our FREE full-sized bottle of Soothe natural scalp oil with orders over £30 deal! We've got plenty more for Christmas which is in less than a month! #CountdownToChristmas
5477 2018-11-26 16:30:29 Few good points that happened n last three weeks. No media cares to report them.

1) US going soft on Iran oil sanctions, chabahar port work also given exemption....

2) India going to trade with Iran n INR this will save lot of FX reserve for India....
5478 2018-11-26 16:30:26 Honestly, the worst part is him being a chickenshit about it and not owning it and being honest.  Watch the video of him urging his offense to keep going and to hurry up... he’s a spineless snake oil salesman.  Would have mild respect for him if he just admitted it

5480 2018-11-26 16:30:23 Sorry for not posting in a long time, guys. Been working real hard on this essay (barely). Once I clean up this essay, gonna finish working on this drawing I never finished. Should be a treat for your eyes!
5481 2018-11-26 16:30:20 I hated my Foodsaver. Growing up in my family's restaurant showed me how much better commercial equipment is vs consumer. The VP215 can seal unlimited bags at a go without needing breaks to cool down. It can handle liquids.

It also weighs 84lbs & needs periodic oil changes.
5482 2018-11-26 16:30:20 Looks like it needs a rub with orange oil.
5483 2018-11-26 16:30:13 U know those foundations that give u a glowy finish!!!! Like just not matte lah HAHA in this stupid sg weather that glowy finish becomes a mirror finish cos sweat n lots of oil rly soon then ur eye make up starts to MELT
5484 2018-11-26 16:30:09 wo sisters who started a petition to ban the use of palm oil in Kellogg's products have been invited to meet the company's UK chief executive. #Parkesandco
5485 2018-11-26 16:30:07 Two are holy water, one is holy oil.
5486 2018-11-26 16:30:06  We can run the adoption papers but I have a feeling that your parents will make me drink anointing oil on a daily. 
5487 2018-11-26 16:30:04 What benefit did any common man in Nigeria get from oil when it was selling high. It's FG, NNPC & co headache. They should be nursing it. I can't wait for 2019 Election.
5488 2018-11-26 16:29:50 The anointed oil pouredforth    from the blue  sky .
5489 2018-11-26 16:29:46 This morning so far I’ve got covered in coolant and oil, and been running around chasing down compressors but at least I didn’t forget my Red Bull.
5490 2018-11-26 16:29:45 Please stop using any type of palm oil...you are helping to destroy a myriad of species and our children will know who is responsible.
5491 2018-11-26 16:29:44 Why? You happily buy Saudi Arabian oil instead of Canadian, why should I buy a vehicle made in Ontario instead of one made in the US. If you want a country it has to flow both ways
5492 2018-11-26 16:29:43 Sadly not that simple. Key for UAE interests in a world they envisage moving away from oil is to diversify and to do that they need to be able to do business with the west. Manchester City - a great club - are sadly a pawn in that and are having their name blackened.
5493 2018-11-26 16:29:43 It would have been appropriate if the McLaren had shit the bed mid doughnuts, bits of gearbox and oil all over the grid. 

Hey, McLaren have been "my" team since the 1970's, I can make fun of their woeful recent performance!
5494 2018-11-26 16:29:27 It's based on demand.  Many people aren't working and many are struggling.  A combination of project completion, high taxes, slow/shut down of oil and gas industries out west.  All of this increased demand for seats and families had more disposable income for travel.
5495 2018-11-26 16:29:24 I use tree tea oil, vitamin e oil I heard it’s good af for dreads
5496 2018-11-26 16:29:24 Have you ever tried CBD Oil to help combat the nerve pain? I personally know people who have benefitted from taking it. Let me know if you want to read their testamonies on it! Fibro sucks!
5497 2018-11-26 16:29:19 Take the oil vs use the oil money to pay US companies to reconstruct the country. Maybe same end result ($).
5498 2018-11-26 16:29:18 Starting my Extra virgin olive oil session tonight!
5499 2018-11-26 16:29:15 If only I was I but closer I’d be there like a flash JLC  are you planning on doing anything a tad further north in the near future? If you are I’ll dust off the Grifter and oil the sturmey archers  
5500 2018-11-26 16:29:12 I'm heartened by the outpouring of compassion for those working families affected by the Oshawa plant closure. I wish we had the same level of compassion for those affected by troubles in Alberta's oil industry.
5501 2018-11-26 16:29:06 I think Russia Just bit off more, than It is going to be able to chew.....Iranian Oil sanctions, are going to squeeze Them as well as additional Sanctions, That the US is going to Apply....Piracy is not going to be Tolerated.......
5502 2018-11-26 16:28:59 Absolutely 
You clean it stuff it with fruit oranges apples, celery, onions 
Fill cavity with Champaign 1 bottle any kind
Rub with olive oil and Turkey rub plus rosemary  
Baste every 20 min, take out as soon as timer pops out
Let stand 10 min 
Moistest Turkey fall off the bone
5503 2018-11-26 16:28:56 1-1 

For plus money last night.
Oil cans on the forever do not bet list until McJesus is traded.
5504 2018-11-26 16:28:49 Atleast there should have been some kind of a protest by the civil society.
5505 2018-11-26 16:28:49 Have you seen the amount of oil money A&M has? We've got this
5506 2018-11-26 16:28:43 @silkdynastystx Nice call on the oil bounce. 50 big round num to break
5507 2018-11-26 16:28:42 Chile I was staring at your fro the other night on FaceTime  

And yes, that’s why I got these braids in for now... 

What oil did you use the other day?
5508 2018-11-26 16:28:38 Ik what id rather. Governments will be perfectly be happy to let there economies run on blood oil. The morale argument should be: how do we stop this, not should we accept money from them. Only government  intervention can help, not fans. All we can do is condem
5509 2018-11-26 16:28:30 Fu una recessione alimentata molto dal deleveraging frenetico, forse per questo oil non reagì prima ma dopo (penso a tastiera accesa)

5514 2018-11-26 16:28:00 Exactly. And he doesn't doubt the word of the oil, gas and coal companies???
5515 2018-11-26 16:27:58 I had a friend that would add some to the wet ingredients to help with the texture of the cake.  After all mayo is just egg, oil and vinegar. Of those ingredients actually go in cake.
5516 2018-11-26 16:27:42 They have good hemp oil down there that's the new oil craze
5517 2018-11-26 16:27:42 Get them to pressure test the cooling system from memory there's  seals on the cooler where it seals to the block 2 water 2 oil they've probably torn one of the o rings oh what fun xx
5518 2018-11-26 16:27:41 I went on their website and they don’t have anything for oil changes. Found some old emails with great coupons and I’m going to see if they honor them even if they did expire a month ago lol
5519 2018-11-26 16:27:39 Oil prices are not down. Stop lying.
5520 2018-11-26 16:27:35 You are perpetuating ignorance and hate, and attitudes like yours have already killed 2 of my friends. These were people who'd done nothing to deserve it, they'd just had the misfortune to be born of pregnancies where a snake oil treatment sold by a corrupt and criminal pharma /
5521 2018-11-26 16:27:35 What do retailers get? I sell only shell oil in south coast but I have never gotten even a dust coat.
5522 2018-11-26 16:27:34 Especially when "best endeavours" relies upon the word of proven cheats, liars and drunks. It's a bit like buying shares in Argentine Railways or Columbian Oil Wells from an American gentleman in a pork pie hat, with slicked back hair who is known to his pals as "Soapy" Maguire.
5523 2018-11-26 16:27:33 A lot of lack of renewable here is the oil co grip. I love internal combustion, but I stopped using 110 oct leaded and went to e85. There has to be some balance, we aren't ready to quit coal yet. But we do need to move power sources forward.
5524 2018-11-26 16:27:33 Yes there is. There is a big difference in a citizen exercising their first amendment rights in disagreeing with an elected official, and some cronies getting air time with oil money in their pockets saying climate change isn’t real.
5525 2018-11-26 16:27:31 Aalmi Market Me Crude Oil Ki Qeematon Me Musalsal Mandi Fi Barrel Me 3 $ Ki Kami, 50 Din Me 29 $ Ki Kami, Oil $ 50.89 Sent Par Agaya.
5526 2018-11-26 16:27:24 From my research topic: The impact of oil spills from shipping on the marine environment, in my research, I  found that the solutions to solve oil spills in a green way can aviod to cause larger pollute to air or marine environment.
5527 2018-11-26 16:27:22 I actually look after my vehicle but on the odd occasion I have used them they have been superb. I’m listening to a man who doesn’t put oil in his engine and a guy who drives without a spare tyre but yeah it’s the AA’s fault 
5528 2018-11-26 16:27:21 Not in any way defending Bush jr's Iraq war on lies but trump's greedy idiot idea & what the neoCons were trying to do with Iraq are very different & most quotes about the oil are saying if Iraq didn't have oil (key to the world economy), there would be no war. Not "take the oil"
5529 2018-11-26 16:27:18 МНЕ НУЖНО СРОЧНО ВОСКРЕСИТЬ СВОЙ ТВИТТЕР ИБО КОГДА НА НГ Я НАЕБЕНЮСЬ К ЧЕРТЯМ МНЕ НУЖЕН КТО-ТО КТО БУДЕТ С МЕНЯ ОРАТЬ
5530 2018-11-26 16:27:03 No I don’t think oil fields were being covered up, but you wrote an article that referenced Clair ridge as a secret oil field. Im sorry that the vagueness of my comment upset you, I strive to be accurate at all times.
5531 2018-11-26 16:26:59 But, it's Ontario... Centre of the universe. I'll bet @JustinTrudeau shows up with financial help within days - vs the months it took to help Alberta when oil prices crashed in 2014.
5532 2018-11-26 16:26:49 It’s so easy for me to spend money on other people but if it’s something I actually need like new tires or something I’m hella cheap. I be like it’s okay who tf needs an oil change anyways?
5533 2018-11-26 16:26:45 U.S. crude oil lost 11% last week, the steepest weekly percentage decline since January 2016. It fell 7.7% Friday, its biggest one-day drop since July 2015.
5534 2018-11-26 16:26:42 Black Star Oil e Crefisa patrocinando o Palmeiras. Será? Galiotte disse que vai tentar!
5535 2018-11-26 16:26:39 RIP GM and Ford when oil prices skyrocket again.
5536 2018-11-26 16:26:27 If love was oil, I'd be a quart low.
5537 2018-11-26 16:26:26 Oil prices are fine, the Alberta problem is because @JustinTrudeau and LPC have deliberately cancelled and blocked pipelines, Hard to save when the fed govt, takes $200b from you to give to Quebec. Educate yourself
5538 2018-11-26 16:26:21 I’ve seen it over and over, and it makes me so mad! Yes those women are really dumb for choosing alternative medicine but I’m most upset with the snake oil salespeople that convince them it will work! They come back 6-12 months later when the cancer has spread everywhere.
5539 2018-11-26 16:26:05 where do you get it from?? i know they sell cbd snacks just about anywhere but where do you get the actual oil?
5540 2018-11-26 16:26:00 Exactly how much money do these people think there is in writing reports about climate change? I am pretty sure that if money were required, it is more lucrative to write reports denying it for oil companies...
5541 2018-11-26 16:25:58 FUCK AJSJDJJSKS OLIVE OIL THIS SHIT SENT ME @triviasseok
5542 2018-11-26 16:25:54 Tel Aviv winter: t-shirt weather outside; huddling around the space heater inside

Montreal winter: numb fingers and toes within five minutes outside; apartment so warm the coconut oil is liquid

DC winter: mildly, unpleasantly cold outside; mildly, unpleasantly cold inside
5543 2018-11-26 16:25:54 Let’s see...who are behind all these climate change “awareness” stuff and propose the carbon tax? Hint: Same groups of people who deliberately suppress the developments of new, clean, near-free energy that can break the monopoly of the oil industry.
5544 2018-11-26 16:25:51 The Govt can't change the price of oil bud.
5545 2018-11-26 16:25:50 I’m looking to expand my essential oil collection, especially since I can get them BOGO today for cyber Monday. 
Would you please share with me your favorite oils or oil blends?
5546 2018-11-26 16:25:47 Castor oil mixed with coconut oil
5547 2018-11-26 16:25:25 I do not know what you expect. The gov't bought a pipeline. So many market forces re: oil. I just hear it is all Trudeaus fault.
5548 2018-11-26 16:25:21 Cause I’d rather drink out of a bottle of oil then eat there lol
5549 2018-11-26 16:25:19 I guess someone forgot to pay the Gas/Oil company, why else would someone wear a coat and gloves indoors?

5556 2018-11-26 16:24:45 If the price of oil is falling so much, then why are the pump prices still climbing?
Cost my wife £72 for a tank of diesel this morning - Ford Kuga, nothing mental.
5557 2018-11-26 16:24:43 Instructive contradiction on @globeandmail website this morning. Energy stocks up on oil prices while the Globe reports on abandoned wells & the looming financial/environmental crises in the oilpatch due to neglecting reclamation. Taxpayers beware! #cdnpoli #abpoli

5559 2018-11-26 16:24:33 Kfb dear.. There much oil in your head.
5560 2018-11-26 16:24:27 Just like he did for the oil & gas workers? But he does need their votes so they will get a better deal
5561 2018-11-26 16:24:24 Nice! I've been doing double cleansing with an oil I got off of Sokoglam, and I have no idea if it's helping but it feels nice.
5562 2018-11-26 16:24:23 we only goto war for oil interests!
5563 2018-11-26 16:24:23 Or olive oil.
5564 2018-11-26 16:24:21 CNN has a problem too if this is the case.  They need to disclose this sort of thing on screen while he is talking.  He is not an ex-politician. He is a paid oil hack. The people need to know this
5565 2018-11-26 16:24:20 I don't agree with prosecution for oil companies but they should be held accountable and called out for lying to protect their business interest.
5566 2018-11-26 16:24:18 GOP's idea of "case work" and helping people always requires it always be done in a far away place that has oil, and that it involve guns and bombs.
5567 2018-11-26 16:24:05 Sana oil hahaha
5568 2018-11-26 16:24:04 outside of geopolitical tensions (kasshogi, Ukraine, Mex) why?
rising dollar, rising rates, weak outlook for '19, weak asia, trade war
best way to fight russia is squashing oil prices w/permian basin supply
5569 2018-11-26 16:23:57 Why isn't Kellogg's using sustainable palm oil???
5570 2018-11-26 16:23:57 Impact of KSA's 2014 flood the market policy. It was not to kill US shale, but kill new global mega projects.  OPEC, now ROPEC, stronger position now.  US shale, full of light oil that works for primarily gasoline, capex intensive and will exhaust itself...keeping OPEC in charge
5571 2018-11-26 16:23:54 You don't think hes a 90 year old oil baron with a dodgy heart then? 
5572 2018-11-26 16:23:53 Well it’s between 135bopd & 270bopd from #Wressle.  Decent bit of production for a tiny outfit etc. But it’s what #UJO get in aggregate from #Biscathorpe #Raithlin that makes them Best UK onshore oil play. IMHO. Also fully funded etc.

5576 2018-11-26 16:23:32 The sun cooling is like applying a bandaid to an infected wound, doesn't really do much because the infection is gonna keep spreading. Reducing carbon emissions, switching to renewable energy resources and ending the oil/coal industry would be the way to stop it.
5577 2018-11-26 16:23:30 Haven't we declared war on third world dictators causing chaos? Oh wait a minute that was about the oil. Sorry I'm confused!

5582 2018-11-26 16:23:08 Why is Germany buying oil from them?
5583 2018-11-26 16:23:06 Gryle would LOATHE Smyle just on principle, he's the exact target Gryle likes to mess with but i think the fact Smyle is technically him would set him off. Poor Smyle would be scared out of his wits around him :c Like mixing water and oil, not a good idea!
5584 2018-11-26 16:23:03 Venezuela became how it is today because of it's reliance on oil. It had all it's chips in one industry, so when that industry started to falter, it didn't have the supplies/resources from other industries and became what it is today. To say it is because of socialist policies...
5585 2018-11-26 16:22:59 I would bet my life on seed oil.  
5586 2018-11-26 16:22:54 New pipelines hope to bring on new supply and alleviate market constraints. Additionally, if we see oil continue to crash, a bunch of LNG fees gas will stay home.
5587 2018-11-26 16:22:54 say that again and I’ll take your oil
5588 2018-11-26 16:22:44 Our offer started today  It is a free cleansing oil or eye cream with a $95 purchase!

5595 2018-11-26 16:22:19 Mr. President I hope by now you know, President of the USA negotiated with Saudi Arabia about lowering the price of oil, please let all those cartels dealing in it do the same in our country.... let's be fair not greedy.
5596 2018-11-26 16:22:18 You're Welcome Canada, 100000s of oil and manufacturing jobs lost, debt burdening health care infrastructure and education for generations and a complete loss of respect for the country on the world stage. #Liberal #Achievement
5597 2018-11-26 16:22:15 No I think not. I have 3 kids, one income family (and it’s not a fatty oil & gas one). Im middle class at best. And kids are enrolled. It’s a sacrifice every month. But the tax credit being slashed was no impact. The incentive it was was really not that interesting anyway.
5598 2018-11-26 16:22:10 The oil patch has never-never asked for a bail out, they have asked for market access! And, Albert has continued to transfer billions-billions in its downturn!
There’s a huge difference & you shouldn’t spew that kind of bullshit without thinking it through & educating yourself!
5599 2018-11-26 16:22:06 My car is long overdue for oil change, sadly. But that’s gonna change by noon today.

5608 2018-11-26 16:21:05 I wonder what it would look like if the oil industry was in Ontario or Quebec instead of Alberta? Hmmm
5609 2018-11-26 16:21:02 oh, and some have a TON of oil.
5610 2018-11-26 16:21:01 Ah the tricks of the trade! Shaving cream, just like I said the other day! And the motor oil on the pancakes with the cardboard fillers - brilliant!
5611 2018-11-26 16:20:55 Now we need the rip off oil companies to lower prices at the pump. WHY are they still so HIGH??? #BigOilStillRippingOffAmericans
5612 2018-11-26 16:20:53 I’ve had one GM product ever. The Opel Astra (rebadged here as a Saturn). When GM axed Saturn they wouldn’t even change my oil at the local dealerships for fear of discovering warranty covered work they didn’t want to do.

5614 2018-11-26 16:20:37 Money huh? And all the oil and coal companies who’d have to change their business to stop the effects of climate change of have no stake in this at all, right?

5624 2018-11-26 16:19:29 A simple help for the zit is a little bit of hand lotion with alcohol. Put a little drop on your finger and rub it on the zit. That will help pull the oil and the dirt out of it.
5625 2018-11-26 16:19:23 Ford has been the smartest... look at the bail out. I admit, I’m skeptical of the shift to all SUVs, because I fear what’ll happen when oil prices rise again. Also, because I hate not having a choice between car and SUV.

5633 2018-11-26 16:18:40 Knew this old man who sunk most of his life savings into a palm oil candle shop, I was the first(with the courage)to explain 2 him why progressive people might not buy them, watching his heart break was deeply disturbing for me,
Like a orangutan orphan with no trees.
So similar
5634 2018-11-26 16:18:39 Yes we have seen Russia basically hold them to ransom a few times so perhaps Putin os using as a bargaining chip - he also plays the nationalist Russia card in tough times which sanctions and low oil are bringing
5635 2018-11-26 16:18:28 That's what I've been saying for years now...The question is how do we get it done? Will oil corps change with the times without being forced to? We need real leadership now. @AlGore2020
5636 2018-11-26 16:18:26 The oil patch is one of the biggest buyers of fleet vehicles.  Guess what, they aren’t buying any.  The trickle down effect of a struggling oil and gas industry is far reaching.  It’s all connected.  This is all on @JustinTrudeau.

5644 2018-11-26 16:17:38 This is the reality of changes brought on by the acceleration of EVs, the coming transition to autonomous vehicles and climate change. You have all FAILED to read the tea leaves and do what must be done...doubling down on oil and pipelines instead. #OilShill

5651 2018-11-26 16:17:19 I eat #homegrown #vegan food supplemented by foraged food which forms about 80% of my diet. I buy organic Spanish oranges & avocados I don’t eat palm oil. I use the car once a week & cycle everywhere. I could sell carbon credits. It’s a totally normal lifestyle at this stage.
5652 2018-11-26 16:17:18 No palm oil is now.
5653 2018-11-26 16:17:17 I hope it's more than what he's done for the oil patch . . .
5654 2018-11-26 16:17:04 Although I do believe in the article it says that the oil prices decrease in the winter.
5655 2018-11-26 16:17:02 Why do you not do a news article on how Canada for decades has provided 40% of oil to the United States. Plus at a low price since we are kind neighbours.

5671 2018-11-26 16:15:37 By late 2014 Nigeria was on well on the path of a recession. Look at GDP growth data: 

Q3 2014: 6.23%
Q4: 5.93%
Q1 2015: 3.96%
Q2 2015: 2.35%

With halving of oil prices in 2014, and absence of a savings buffer for the ‘rainy day’, the economy was doomed well before May 29, 2015

- $114B in a secret bank bailout
- $9B for auto industry bailouts
- $1B for softwood lumber industry
- Upwards of $34B a year in oil and gas subsidies

But this is all Trudeau's fault.

5680 2018-11-26 16:14:58 The oil industry really began in Turner Valley in 1914 and Alberta has been sending scads of money to Ottawa ever since.  We don't send Liberal MP's. As predicted, Trudeau jumped on the Oshawa election problem within hours.  All Alberta got was a patronizing pat on the head.

5692 2018-11-26 16:14:01 I agree that the USA greatly increasing their oil output over the past few years (a trend that will continue) is putting downward pressure on oil prices as well.

5704 2018-11-26 16:13:26 This is a really important issue and we’ve been driving industry-wide change for more than 15 years. We’re on track to meet our goal of sourcing 100% physically certified palm oil by the end of 2019.

5718 2018-11-26 16:11:58 Lots of worries for residents. Oil and gas drilling brings problems. With fracking, volumes of underground water is needed. Texas has several aquifers, but it also has deserts, where rain water is not easily replaced. Fracking also causes small earthquakes. Pipelines burst.
5719 2018-11-26 16:11:56 It's the oil. They have already pinched most of it, but there's still a good bit left and they want it. Maybe when it's pumped dry they'll give you your independence.
5720 2018-11-26 16:11:53 There is a direct connection. Gas is lower because there is an over supply of oil. An over supply of oil means that the cost of crude is down. The tar sands bitumen is cheap because of the lack of heavy oil refineries in Canada. AB should have built some when oil was >$100/bbl.
5721 2018-11-26 16:11:49 I don’t think you’re wrong, but I’m curious what is the solution? With little cap space, few assets, and no other team going to help the Oil what can be done to improve things? Or, can this team win but needs to get their stuff together?
5722 2018-11-26 16:11:43 Like you have helped the OVER 100,000 workers that lost their jobs when YOU shut down 3 projects in the oil fields? You did NOTHING.

5733 2018-11-26 16:11:02 So the Canadian Government knows more than the US, Russian, Scandinavian, and Middle East Governments - all of which are expanding oil production?  That seems.... unlikely.
5734 2018-11-26 16:10:57 @smerconish @ChrisCuomo @DanRather @maggieNYT @sbg1 @JenGranholm @donlemon @secupp Like the tailors that sold the emperor his new clothes, it trumpy economists are selling snake oil remedies.  The deficit is enslaving americans!
5735 2018-11-26 16:10:57 Hi Tracey. This is a really important issue and we’ve been driving industry-wide change for more than 15 years. We’re on track to meet our goal of sourcing 100% physically certified palm oil by the end of 2019.
5736 2018-11-26 16:10:56 A poor distraction "supply natural gas" Let's stay focused on the greed of oil. We can even include elite of Atlantic Council behind convicted Russian criminal Mikhail Khodorkovsky to go back to raping Russia of oil and other resources. They want their 90's raping of Russia back
5737 2018-11-26 16:10:55 Judging by how chia wasn’t fired immediately after the hall trade, I have zero faith that the oil let him go before the end of the season, no matter how bad it gets.
5738 2018-11-26 16:10:44 Maybe if there had been a strong oil and gas industry in the West - GM would have stayed in Ontario.  They can sell cars to Canada from outside the country.  Wait for it - the luddites will be hollering for a GM boycott.
5739 2018-11-26 16:10:41 and the meaning of Gethsemane is "wine press' the anointing oil of Christos. -Am*

5741 2018-11-26 16:10:36 Frank Graham is an opportunist. He is the snake oil salesman, making money off of people’s fears. He claims to have special knowledge of God, yet he supports an evil person like Trump, because it’s good for his business.
5742 2018-11-26 16:10:31 Pour the oil and light the match!
5743 2018-11-26 16:10:30 Palm oil free chocolate? The world is increasingly for that age group. Does the school put climate on the co-corriculum? Front and centre?
5744 2018-11-26 16:10:28 Hi there. This is a really important issue and we’ve been driving industry-wide change for more than 15 years. We’re on track to meet our goal of sourcing 100% physically certified palm oil by the end of 2019.
5745 2018-11-26 16:10:22 Could it have been around the time 'A British Oil Company' made such a mess of the Gulf of Mexico?

5748 2018-11-26 16:10:05 When you heat olive oil it causes the fats to oxidize which turns it into something unhealthy. Olive oil is healthy cold.
5749 2018-11-26 16:10:03 いえいえ…もっとお時間あれば永遠とお話ししたかったでござります。

5751 2018-11-26 16:09:55 "A lot of these scientists are driven by the money" says Senator bought by oil companies.
Wanna bet he gets paid more than said scientists?

5753 2018-11-26 16:09:49 ...Obama, representing the democrat party was no peace seeking visionary diplomat. He was a warmonger like the republicans and gas and oil prices were highest under Obama. He also wasted trillions on military weapons, causing us to further go into debt.
5754 2018-11-26 16:09:49 No I haven’t, she HATES water. But I could try that! So put the coconut oil on like a conditioner and then rinse it off?
5755 2018-11-26 16:09:49 do any of you guys use CBD oil??? does it really help pain??
5756 2018-11-26 16:09:43 Just spent $20 on 2 oil diffusers & 8 essential oils. I love cyber Monday

5758 2018-11-26 16:09:22 Invest in green technology instead of allowing oil companies to profit while they pollute.

5760 2018-11-26 16:09:21 That’s a good point. A 3rd party hasn’t been elected President, since George Washington (looked it up). That doesn’t mean it can’t be done and we really need at least 3-4 viable parties, it’s just not likely.I hope they don’t try to run Hillary or some oil invested billionaire
5761 2018-11-26 16:09:19 YOU mean the 17 million that were lied and sold cheap snake oil?
HISTORY will not be kind to this politicians and to the 17 million of easy prey.
The youth in this country doesn't won't BREXIT.
This mess will be reversed.
5762 2018-11-26 16:09:16 rm16 mcmtu je tak silap aku kalau sale. harga asal like rm21. tapi tahan lama selalu aku beli time sale buat simpan stock hahaha. ikutla yg ni jenis cleansing milk, kalau nk guna oil punya aku guna biore botol purple tuje yg ni function if nk remove eye makeup kau hahaha
5763 2018-11-26 16:09:11 "depends on what you know about anal leakage and oil diffusing" - misheard price is right
5764 2018-11-26 16:09:03 So selling America's moral high ground to advocate state sponsored #murder by another country is the way to get things done?  If you actually did drive the price of oil down, I'd have to think about thanking a psychopath president about it.
5765 2018-11-26 16:09:00 Butter, lard or coconut oil. Mostly butter and lard though.
5766 2018-11-26 16:08:59 Where we live outside the bubble it is clear that central Canada led by Justin Trudeau is deliberately working to destroy the oil industry and Alberta's economy by blocking pipelines and decommissioning rail cars, quite simple really
5767 2018-11-26 16:08:50 Snake oil!! Get your snake oil here!!...
5768 2018-11-26 16:08:47 OR is this a movie poster for a Western about a battle for control of the Wyoming beard oil market?
5769 2018-11-26 16:08:31 finally getting a new tire and they threw im an oil change which is litty so this Monday is great 
5770 2018-11-26 16:08:28 I am sorry, Chris. You need to find a way to make this right. The easiest thing to do is to delete your tweet and apologise. I doubt you think that the govt was covering up well-publicised oil fields.  But if you do, I'm sure somebody more senior in @thesnp can help you.
5771 2018-11-26 16:08:21 Whenever Haseena Moin visits my mil, I treat her like a diva: some flattery, some interrogation, few updates on sexual harassment debate.
5772 2018-11-26 16:08:20 Trump is in the oil business with Putin and they both need Ukraine out of the way to move the oil through the Black sea! Trump will say as little as possible.
5773 2018-11-26 16:08:17 Hey Paranoid Donnie or should I say President T, oil prices are up!!! Also, Putin is being a very bad boy!
5774 2018-11-26 16:08:11 oil of every pearls un-insides is really THAT album huh
5775 2018-11-26 16:08:11 Beach House - 7 / Serpentwithfeet - Oil / Mitski - Be The Cowboy / Saba - Care For Me / Noname - Room 25 / Denzel Curry - TA1300
5776 2018-11-26 16:08:08 I'm promoting TMX and you accuse me of being "down on oil". Perhaps some reading comprehension is in order?
5777 2018-11-26 16:08:00 I read labels and stopped using anything with Palm Oil years ago. Nutella lovers, try Justin’s. Much better tasting.
5778 2018-11-26 16:07:45 “As for the 6 month business activity outlook, it fell 10 pts to the least since October 2016.” Tough tariff talk meets drop in oil prices. Squaring the circle to bottoming of initial jobless claims in oil-dependent and manufacturing-dependent is ELEMENTARY.
5779 2018-11-26 16:07:43 Drama is the new oil
5780 2018-11-26 16:07:37 Mice can fit through a hole the size of a dime, so if a pencil can fit through, a mouse can, so seal those holes asap. Until you can get a rodent control company to your house, mix peppermint oil with water in a spray bottle and spray your room, they hate the smell of peppermint.
5781 2018-11-26 16:07:37 Your argument holds as much water as claiming soldiers signed up for the army after 9/11 to protect US oil interests
5782 2018-11-26 16:07:36 Hops are good, too. Perhaps we should all have a Ploughman's Lunch for supper! Seriously, a handful of hops tied up in a hankie under your pillow gives off soporific scent. Add essential oil of rose or lavender or ylang ylang if you don't like the smell.
5783 2018-11-26 16:07:35 Doe's anyone know where the hundreds of billions of oil money went
5784 2018-11-26 16:07:34 The people of this country don’t want Saudi oil and they don’t want oil at all. 

That’s the majority consensus from what I can tell... 

The entire world is shifting away from oil, the people of this country of spoken whether it’s rammed down our throat or not...
5785 2018-11-26 16:07:28 Рада, что не одна такая

5787 2018-11-26 16:06:52 Yes, as opposed to the heads of oil and coal companies, who are completely unbiased and not driven by cash. Also the politicians who made them promises, definitely not influenced by money.

5789 2018-11-26 16:06:34 Awesome no “Borders in 2020”  Vote Beto/Waters 

With fracking the US has become energy self sufficient, we will be easily able to Accommodate the extra 10’s of millions of new immigrants with oil.
5790 2018-11-26 16:06:31 doing it for the money ?   He is speaking for himself - themselves -    all the Mr big oil !!
5791 2018-11-26 16:06:31 Ahh yes, cause the 2017/18 picture was actually an oil painting... 
5792 2018-11-26 16:06:24 Aku takut melekit berminyak je kalau letak oil dekat muka. Kalau letak kat jambang ok lagi hahaha. Skrg aku letak aloe vera je tp tak jalan. Takpe nnt aku try tengok cemana pegi dia kalau letak argan oil. Hahaha

5796 2018-11-26 16:06:01 I expect a new tax on the oil industry to prop up the auto sector and Bombardier of course, but no matter Albertans will complain a bit and then happily remain a part of the failed confederation
5797 2018-11-26 16:06:01 No country will sacrifice anything to stop it. 
"we need their gas. we need their oil. we don't want any trouble." Europe, et al

Oops I mean heads from tails.

He thinks oil comes from Walmart.
5799 2018-11-26 16:05:54 We only get 9% of oil from Saudi Arabia so keep lieing that ur doing so good
5800 2018-11-26 16:05:45 Aztec Clay Mask, Clears the oil from your pores and Cleanses skin.
5801 2018-11-26 16:05:31 2 years ago , Standing Rock,  US National Guard firing rubber bullets and gassing Indigenous Americans on behalf of a foreign Oil Company and illegal pipeline, and we had a “good” President then!!!
5802 2018-11-26 16:05:17 No, you just use other people’s children instead. 
Although, to be fair, I seem to recall you used 5000 or so of your own in Iraq to shield your oil companies.
5803 2018-11-26 16:05:16 If your man can’t at least change your oil in your car throw him away
5804 2018-11-26 16:05:14 @LucasRacingTV  I just wondering for next year will you have more live events for the Lucas oil late models an if you are going to do the Lucas oil pro pulling live on lor tv

5807 2018-11-26 16:05:06 I’m an oil sands worker,I’m a electrician and I have not been able to find work for the last 8 months. There is thousands like me..what happens when EI runs out for all of us? We are going to lose our homes, our lives.. this nightmare is going to make the 80’s look like a dream.
5808 2018-11-26 16:05:04 I really have coconut oil in my eyes 
5809 2018-11-26 16:05:03 E.U. won't stand up to jackshit. they are dependent on Russian oil, which is what President Trump warned them about.
5810 2018-11-26 16:05:02 @drjamesdinic just re-watched the interview with @MikeMutzel and I was wondering what are your thoughts on Bronson Antarctic krill oil? In the only available in my country. How many a day would you take? Thanks!
5811 2018-11-26 16:05:01 Totally agree with @JohnFinnieHI. The announcment of £30 million investment into The Port of Cromarty Firth should mean the end to the threat of ship to ship oil transfers once and for all. 
It's just not worth it. 
@CalumDuncanMCS
@mcsuk
@saveourseas
5812 2018-11-26 16:04:58 You know you’re waiting on an oil change because the waiting room music switches between Rihanna, imagine dragons, and Christmas music. No one has curated that playlist.
5813 2018-11-26 16:04:51 Iba pang oil firms susunod na rin sa big time rollback
5814 2018-11-26 16:04:48 Will you do this by giving away more money in Foreign aid??? 
Auto Workers don't get #corporatewelfare like your friends at Bombardier or the MEDIA! Killing CANADA one province at a time NO Alberta Oil NO Ontario Auto!! GREAT WORK JACKASS!!
5815 2018-11-26 16:04:48 The oil market was challenged way before he took office despite the investment made by previous administrations. That's why the NDP got in.

Don't ignore that they have bankrupted an oil rich country Gareth,you tried to ignore that disgrace didn't you?
5818 2018-11-26 16:04:19 Fancy lunch be like:

Be wise.

5822 2018-11-26 16:03:48 IT's okay to kill our grandchildren so long as the Oil industry profits from it.
5823 2018-11-26 16:03:48 We need energy independence, not continued oil dependency.
5824 2018-11-26 16:03:47 Saudi have oil .. it’s theirs not yours so don’t say they control “our” oil! I told you.. you must get ur facts straight!

5826 2018-11-26 16:03:43 My oil “only hope” is we continue importing other peoples inventory for 40-60 a barrel. At sub 40 companies close and jobs start getting cut. 

Futures - hopefully it’s a short term investment. Contango is a killer.
5827 2018-11-26 16:03:39 We all know where all the oil money has gone.Fat cat's back pockets and not into the economy where it should of done.Answers regarding the price difference of a pint aren't worthy of a reply as living standards of both countries don't compare.
5828 2018-11-26 16:03:38 Ha sido oferta - demanda. Oferta: donde se esperaba recorte por parte Iran y de Arabia Saudita no ha sido así (Iran vende por las espaldas a China, así qeu no ha desaparecido oferta) + que a 80$ incentivas shale oil (más oferta de USA). Demanda: cambio visión (se espera bajada).
5829 2018-11-26 16:03:35 STOP letting niggas with dirty finger nails play in your pussy  you had a UTI for 3 week & don’t know why...Cause you got backwoods, motor oil, weed flakes, mayo, ketchup & lemon pepper seasoning in you hoe 
5830 2018-11-26 16:03:31 Just like Norway which is so very very deep in austerity because they invested in an oil fund and saved it. Right? Right?! 
5831 2018-11-26 16:03:22 @JKSuicideWatch Hey General Shithead-do you honestly think that Cadet Bone Spurs has affected oil prices? If so, you are as delusional as he is.
5832 2018-11-26 16:03:18 OK. I read the passages & it seemed to hold water, but I'm no lawyer for sure.
I view the trade between the EU & UK as akin to steering an oil tanker - ie it would take some time to change direction.
Surely if they want to sell and we want to buy an agreement will be easy?

5834 2018-11-26 16:02:54 Short Takes post coming later today will cover oil prices as well.
5835 2018-11-26 16:02:46 Lower Growth Environment??!!
LMAO!!

The U.S. —Is Posting RECORD Growth!!
-GDP—3.2%
-RECORD—U.S Oil Exploration & Exportation!
-LOWEST Unemployment EVER- In All Categories!
-LARGEST Tax Cuts!
-RECORD Deregulation!
-Record Manufacturing!
-Repatriation of $TRILLIONS!
5836 2018-11-26 16:02:45 hey i’m 87 miles overdue for an oil change so if 50 people could cash app me $1 i’d be so grateful $sydneyxe
5837 2018-11-26 16:02:43 The GM justification that it is refocusing on electric cars my have been made to help reduce the bad PR from plant closures but it also goes against Trump who wants expanded oil and coal use and disbelieves climate change.
5838 2018-11-26 16:02:32 That was done by Mulroney et al in NAFTA. No more textiles that we used to be famous for, many manufacturing jobs gone, mandatory oil sale is now gone. Unemployment rate is good & getting better now, wages are up, economy is good. BTW - USMCA not ratified yet. US may stop it.
5839 2018-11-26 16:02:32 Hi, Michele. This is a really important issue and we’ve been driving industry-wide change for more than 15 years. We’re on track to meet our goal of sourcing 100% physically certified palm oil by the end of 2019.
5840 2018-11-26 16:02:31 To be so down on oil and don’t believe in growing Canada’s economy.  Are you also one of those that protest selling arms to Saudis, protest the killing of journalists, but love when Canada buys their oil.  Probably believe that Maple Syrup will save the day.  Go hug some trees.
5841 2018-11-26 16:02:27 And that’s where your conspiracy theory really falls apart. If we had a huge surplus of oil that we allegedly stole from Iraq, then it would make no sense for oil companies to charge higher prices. That’s simple economics
5842 2018-11-26 16:02:24 I heard sperm or the oil inside condom is the best solution
5843 2018-11-26 16:02:23 Thanks to oil price drop heavily...
5844 2018-11-26 16:02:21 It’s a shame for Oshawa. Especially after bail outs. Let’s hope that you get more help than oil and gas has gotten from the inept @JustinTrudeau and his unqualified lackeys

5849 2018-11-26 16:02:06 He might also want to reflect that Scotland also voted to remain part of the U.K. which means we all leave as one. 

Good luck re-running the S-Indy ref with an even more disasterous economic business case, lower oil revenues & budget defict than last time!  
5850 2018-11-26 16:02:05 @RachelNotley although, I appreciate your enthusiasm for Ottawa, we did give them $220 billion, just in oil, while Ottawa was making laws designed against first nations here since the beginning of Confederation, which effect the population here obviously negative considering our
5851 2018-11-26 16:02:02 M just thinking about how they probably are made of oil and tar or somthgin and I feel the need to brush my teeth now
5852 2018-11-26 16:02:01 Чисто по запето? А, ну тогда сорри.
5853 2018-11-26 16:01:56 Nope. This is so predictable. Trump doesn't see a murderer. He sees 80% of the world's oil reserves sitting under the murderer.
5854 2018-11-26 16:01:52 I want to know what he thinks about oil.....
5855 2018-11-26 16:01:52 They bought the pipeline because "business" put their tails between their legs and took off. Have you heard from the oil companies recently? It is their product that we are trying to get to market.
5856 2018-11-26 16:01:49 Oil up them chubby sausages and get that bag cuh
5857 2018-11-26 16:01:44 But thanks to trump the Saudis aren’t charging us more for OIL!
5858 2018-11-26 16:01:38  that’s my bad. I saw coupon and my phone typed Groupon. I’ll check while im sitting here waiting on this oil change.
5859 2018-11-26 16:01:38 Ugh I have to get an oil change today but I don’t feel like waiting 
5860 2018-11-26 16:01:34 Fun fact: responding to climate change & pollution is a government subsidy to clean up the mess from the oil & coal industries.
5861 2018-11-26 16:01:34 Lavender oil is great for calming, soothing and relaxing - Try adding some into your next bath

5863 2018-11-26 16:01:27 How do U know it has oil In it if u've never bought it
5864 2018-11-26 16:01:20 Hi Shannan. This is a really important issue and we’ve been driving industry-wide change for more than 15 years. We’re on track to meet our goal of sourcing 100% physically certified palm oil by the end of 2019.
5865 2018-11-26 16:01:19 The oil patch has been a part of the heart and soul of Canada for generations, yet you forced it into the toilet.
5866 2018-11-26 16:01:15 car salesmen can spot me from a mile away trying to get me to get 5 different types of oil changed when I walked in for snow tires
5867 2018-11-26 16:01:11 So proud of myself - got an oil change and I didn't even whining about it this time. Love me @jiffylube - they vacuum your car!

5869 2018-11-26 16:01:02 So oil prices are falling?
5870 2018-11-26 16:00:48 Olive oil is good for you as long as it's not heated. I poor cool smoked garlic olive oil on my pork chops after they are cooked lol and yummmm
5871 2018-11-26 16:00:46 Combine 4 tsps cherry with 2 cups green beans. Mix into  Olive Oil. Drain. Serve
5872 2018-11-26 16:00:45 @realDonaldTrump Do you realize now, what does mean when THE CAR MARKET (along with housing market) is slow & down, WHILE THE OIL PRICE IS LOW AS WELL? This simply means the US economy is exploding; not booming. Your wrong policies drag the USA into a HELL #GeneralMotors
5873 2018-11-26 16:00:40 What a shame @JustinTrudeau doesn’t have the same empathy for Alberta oil workers as he does for #GM workers!

5883 2018-11-26 15:59:49 Exactly my thought! I'm no economist , but I am invested in oil futures :-)
5884 2018-11-26 15:59:41 Interesting... I’m actually about to get CBD oil for my dog so she’ll calm down lol
5885 2018-11-26 15:59:38 I think Trump will do what he feels he needs to do to protect US workers.  It is Justin Trudeau's job to fight for Canadian jobs.  We have oil trapped in Alberta not getting to market, Trump muscling a new trade accord to help his economy and tariffs on our steel. Tough times.
5886 2018-11-26 15:59:36 So the oil revenues from discovery until now should have saved? Rather than used to fund services at the time. That more austerity then.
5887 2018-11-26 15:59:29 Hi, Jacki. This is a really important issue and we’ve been driving industry-wide change for more than 15 years. We’re on track to meet our goal of sourcing 100% physically certified palm oil by the end of 2019.
5888 2018-11-26 15:59:23 Just use canola or vegetable oil, that works the best
5889 2018-11-26 15:59:19 I've tried some products by Skinfood that I love and some that made be break out so just be careful to avoid anything that is overly moisturizing or oil based
5890 2018-11-26 15:59:13 Wondered why @WholeFoods pumpkin pie didn't taste as good this year. Looked at ingred on leftovers: Palm oil, corn syrup. Hardly shop u now
5891 2018-11-26 15:59:10 I don't understand why Africa exports crude oil and import refined oil at a higher price. That's stupid thinking. Like how girls cut their eyebrows and draw them back.

5904 2018-11-26 15:58:13 Earlier it wasn't as cold but it is now, wish I had cleared the fire out after all, wish I could get moved to a house that had oil as well as a fire =[
5905 2018-11-26 15:58:06 Benghazi was about arming rebels in Syria. That was because of the Qatar Pipeline. Two proposed routes. Both routes go through Syria.,it’s all about oil. All about money.

5919 2018-11-26 15:57:04 The did the oil cooler and have broken/ not sealed something. It’s loosing coolant at an alarming rate. They probably broke a pipe on the new cooler, which must be water cooled where it’s positioned.
They’ve had it back twice since they did it and said there is nothing wrong...

Or does he think people who voted for him are stupid and will believe his ridiculous claims without evidence? Its terrible to lie to Ontarians like that.
5932 2018-11-26 15:55:57 I hate having to do real ass adult things you can't avoid forever like get your oil changed

5934 2018-11-26 15:55:38 It isn't like auto manufacturers slashing jobs wasn't entirely predictable. It was, and many said exactly that. But when you are playing to your base all day selling them snake oil, they will believe anything you say even as you take money straight out of their pockets.

In 2016, we got a POTUS who didn't win the pop vote.

5975 2018-11-26 15:53:19 A part of being PM is treating all people in Canada equally. Now you are treating auto workers better than oil workers. You are also treating people from Ontario better than those in Alberta. Get with the program "big boy" or its time to get out of office.

5984 2018-11-26 15:52:47 President W was not being honest about the Saudi involvement with 911 either because it would affect Bush oil interests. When it comes to politics & money, there are few ethics. Especially now.
5985 2018-11-26 15:52:41 Electricity has the potential of being 100% sustainable and eco friendly while oil is and will be 100% unsustainable and unfriendly to the environment. Surely you understand that. Tesla kickstarted and remains at the forefront of the EV revolution. Undenable. Embrace it.

6000 2018-11-26 15:51:58 Technically this means other countries can now find just cause to invade us and take our oil. We even verifiably have weapons of mass destruction.
6001 2018-11-26 15:51:57 This is true I can’t deny. Picking up bits that have fallen off, putting the oil back in, and saluting old people with AA badges takes real skill.

6012 2018-11-26 15:51:12 Even dumber is to say scientists are "driven by the money" while ignoring the TENS OF BILLION$ in profits being raked in by the oil companies every year. CNN and others should start getting actual scientists and experts on set instead of mindless partisan commentators.

6015 2018-11-26 15:51:03 Hi there. This is a really important issue and we’ve been driving industry-wide change for more than 15 years. We’re on track to meet our goal of sourcing 100% physically certified palm oil by the end of 2019.
6016 2018-11-26 15:50:58 Wouldn't it be nice if we had Northern gateway, Energy East, & TMX pipeline approval so that construction jobs would soften the impact; and so that there would be well-paying jobs in the oil & gas sector so that displaced workers in Ont have an option! But YOU want to kill AB!

No haven’t got oil yet 
Peace man its so psychodelic !
6019 2018-11-26 15:50:53 Well apparently they are not falling here on Long Island NY because they are telling us that our oil prices are rising significantly.

6026 2018-11-26 15:50:27 Since the fall in oil prices are directly related to his trade wars, and fears that the entire global economy is going to tank, he's actually kind of right. Not that he has any clue why.
6027 2018-11-26 15:50:21 , create a dividend check we get quarterly would be great from ourselves our government this is our country we are sovereign. Like Alaska gives their citizens money annually depending on how well the oil season goes we could do something like as we get more and more efficient
6028 2018-11-26 15:50:19 Republicans said Presidents had nothing to do with Oil and Gas prices when they dropped under Obama. So are you lying or were they? 

Your tax cut is hurting the country... YOU are hurting the country
6029 2018-11-26 15:50:18 Haha great comment!!! We have never watched it and won't as Lorraine  supports the use of palm oil and advertising of the products all for a few penny's  she has not defended herself or replied to anyone about it! So we are going to post on all her posts
6030 2018-11-26 15:50:05 I really wish @LesSchwab service oil changes. #LesSchwabOil
6031 2018-11-26 15:50:01 You have done nothing for oil workers who have been layed off, so until you do something for them, why would we believe this BS you continue to pump out.
6032 2018-11-26 15:49:59 Il faudrait une volonté politique incarnée dans une stratégie nationale cohérente integrant l'aspect energie/écologie aussi bien que l'aspect economique/psycho-social mais recuperer notre SouverainetéNationale sera #SineQuaNon.

6036 2018-11-26 15:49:27 And I am not downplaying the race perspective, at all. Its hugely important. But there is more to exxon/oil than race, and I was asking how exactly race impacts on the perception of exxon/oil.

6042 2018-11-26 15:49:02 Dirty Donald wants to take credit for lower oil prices so he must also take credit for a deficit spiraling out of control and the increase in global warming because of his ignorance.
6043 2018-11-26 15:48:58 You had absolutely nothing to do with oil prices falling.

6070 2018-11-26 15:46:49 Oil companies hire geologists/petrologists, so their scientist employees definitely know about climate change (due to anthropogenic global warming caused by the companies they work for). To me they're the most corrupt & evil in this, because they understand it best & still help.

6075 2018-11-26 15:46:03 "While President Trump’s October announcement calling for the year-round availability of E15 was enthusiastically cheered by biofuel producers, farmers and consumers, it drew predictable jeers and indignation from the oil industry and its allies." 1/2
6076 2018-11-26 15:45:59 President Clinton by popular vote worked with real President Obama on policies long ago that insured lower oil prices today.
6077 2018-11-26 15:45:57 All the sheen is off. The degree of abuse this organization has suffered under chia has become clear. After 97/29/93, there is no skill. One top pairing defenseman (77). Spooner would be LW1 on absolutely zero nhl teams. Wow. Deep hole. Happy with hitch, but chia, employed? How?
6078 2018-11-26 15:45:53 Elevating the fuel prices without any justification when the crude oil price is comparatively low. Price of fuel maintained high by imposing high tax rate is a classic example of burdening the general public.

6082 2018-11-26 15:45:35 They really are a backward step. People were glad when they had access to clean oil or gas central heatings, away from dirty wood and coal. Unbelievable that now they voluntarily choose the dirty version again when there are additional options such as heat pumps.
6083 2018-11-26 15:45:31 The president has a responsibility of not wrecking the U.S. economy and trying to keep gas prices in check,if he over reacts to one act by the Saudis of a non U.S. citizen and in fact he was a Saudi national it could increase world oil priced across the board...

I can imagine the same talk over whales. “Why dig coal and oil out of the ground when whales are everywhere!”
The oil and coal will run out. It pollutes. And MANY more jobs in green technology these days.
6128 2018-11-26 15:42:17 It will get worse. Recession as early as late 2019, highly likely in 2020, unless Trump keeps oil prices even lower than they are, the Fed delays rate hikes and trade war gets resolved ASAP.  Otherwise...recession is very likely.  All the signs are there.

6141 2018-11-26 15:41:29 Had to get two new tires, had no oil, my car tweaks out when it’s stopped, windshield wiper fluid won’t come out, and when I turned my wipers on one flew off.... same car, same. I’m falling apart at the same rate.
6142 2018-11-26 15:41:24 ...being covered by largesse from crude oil money are over. No crude oil money to waste like before. It could have been different; Buhari could have let Osinbajo run the economy while he focused on other issues but the cabal around him won't allow it. Buhari failed woefully.

6154 2018-11-26 15:41:03 How much CO2 produced by burning one barrel of oil. Crude oil consists (by weight) of 83% to 87% carbon. One barrel is about 159 liters. #nlpoli
6155 2018-11-26 15:41:03 Bernie vs Beto would be a giant joke. 
Beto would get smoked. He doesn't have Bernie's support from indies or millennials & his ties to the MIC & big oil would put the nails in his coffin.

6191 2018-11-26 15:38:15 Weak oil prices inflict more pain on the Russians than others due to the lack of depth in their economy. 

They have oil and gas reserves. Very few other sources of income.

6193 2018-11-26 15:38:14 I had to try things to find what works. I find tea tree oil, helps to dry up breakouts but it leaves a mark behind. So I had to use rosewater to soothe and witch hazel and cocobutter to fade the Mark's. It's a process, but dont give up.

Elevating the fuel prices without any justification when the crude oil price is comparatively low. Price of fuel maintained high by imposing high tax rate is a classic example of burdening the general public.

6196 2018-11-26 15:37:38 This morning I researched tires, got quotes, negotiated a lower price from my dealership, and scheduled a service appointment to get four new tires installed AND an oil change.
Fear me, for I am All That is Adult.

Because Central America is in crisis, yet we haven't cared because there's no oil. That doesn't stop people from wanting to survive.
6208 2018-11-26 15:36:32 /2 we were competitive even on buds against China because of how we manufactured, our methods were advanced. Every year we got $$ to do more research, but Harper years: focus on oil and gas. I’m not here to beat up Harper legacy, he did a lot of good too. /3

6231 2018-11-26 15:34:58 That is nothing to do with finding oil.

6272 2018-11-26 15:31:42 하하.... 마이너에 치여버렸어.....
6273 2018-11-26 15:31:40 Yes. Any accounts that compares Norway with less oil making 3pb wind a year and Scots make 5 quid znd a half eaten Mars Bar is either wrong or needs changing g to shat Norway is doing. 40 years oil left with low production costs so make the most of it.

6277 2018-11-26 15:31:25 Let's hope not b/c the US' biggest output by far is USTs, & neither we nor our allies can eat or live in USTs.  Chinese imports of US oil to zero in October in a mth where Chinese oil imports set all-time record pretty eye opening.
6278 2018-11-26 15:31:15 People think it is wonderful news about record US oil production and think it means we can be energy independent, no longer need OPEC.. Long Story Short Trump made some deal with the likes of  Saudi Arabia and allies.
6279 2018-11-26 15:31:02 Also, do you have an opinion on the clear bias by those that profit on oil and coal use to deny what all credible scientists agree on?
6280 2018-11-26 15:31:00 Neither can be ignored. Oil is to AB what Auto is to Ontario.  JT is going to have to actually act like a leader as the two engines of this country grind to a halt.

a cotton ball soaked in clove oil. Place it against the gum.
It should help.
6291 2018-11-26 15:30:13 Elevating the fuel prices without any justification when the crude oil price is comparatively low. Price of fuel maintained high by imposing high tax rate is a classic example of burdening the general public.

6310 2018-11-26 15:28:30 Hi, Shelley. This is a really important issue and we’ve been driving industry-wide change for more than 15 years. We’re on track to meet our goal of sourcing 100% physically certified palm oil by the end of 2019.
6311 2018-11-26 15:28:29 Yeah jc talking to hamas is the same as Tony Blair deciding to go to war with Iraq. Talking to the other side to understand and communicate vs going to war on lies and for oil. Seriously keep digging your way out of a hole.
6312 2018-11-26 15:28:27 if it weren't for oil, would anybody give Saudi Arabia a bloody damn??.....strictly a one-trick pony economically...........
6313 2018-11-26 15:28:27 i had most of the cats BUT THEN WE HEARD A REALLY SCARY NOISE FROM THE ROOM W THE HEATER AND I THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA EXPLODE but turns out the guys that refill the oil for us when it gets low came here and were just topping it off lol

6316 2018-11-26 15:28:09 My understanding is solar is 100% reliable, it's just not "cost effective"
Which means, we use oil which costs us far more than just money.

Look, I appreciate we all have bills to pay, I struggle too, I just won't accept that it's up to someone else to fix our system.

6323 2018-11-26 15:27:46 Saudi oil policy is currently enacted along with Russia in OPEC+. They meet next week to discuss policy for next 6 months.
6324 2018-11-26 15:27:35 The war was nothing about fear, America wanted to secure the oil fields.
6325 2018-11-26 15:27:35 Of course GM is leaving.  With another federal liberal government on the way companies like this will leave.  Look as what they have done to oil industry.  So many will just leave.

6332 2018-11-26 15:27:15 1) Would Scotland be better off with 100% of oil and gas revenues or the 8% we get from Westminster?
2) Do you think that HALF of Scottish voters are wrong to want to run their own country?
I look forward to your considered replies Gareth.

6337 2018-11-26 15:27:02 Reading this Article makes you realise that Westminster is indebted to Scotland .

6340 2018-11-26 15:26:53 Bush was going to war he wanted to secure oil, he is the architect yes and Blair followed him blindly
6341 2018-11-26 15:26:45 Canada supplies 40% of US oil. Saudi Arabia has promised to cut production to increase prices. It would Be nice if the POTUS knew FACTS, and occasionally told the truth.
6342 2018-11-26 15:26:38 Exactly. But you know who actually is motivated by money? By hundreds and hundreds of billions? The oil and gas industry. (I think @RickSantorum knows this, btw.)
6343 2018-11-26 15:26:36 Hi, Sue. This is a really important issue and we’ve been driving industry-wide change for more than 15 years. We’re on track to meet our goal of sourcing 100% physically certified palm oil by the end of 2019.

6346 2018-11-26 15:26:20 Exactly! I don’t even take Tylenol or anything unless my headache is too unbearable to function. It drives me insane when people recommend women to take castor oil to induce labor too. That is so dangerous for their baby potentially.
6347 2018-11-26 15:26:08 “...is there oil?” asks the GOP, innocently.

6350 2018-11-26 15:25:47 I'm sure you'd all agree that we need to ratchet up our collective efforts to decarbonise. No more #ICE post 2025 will send out a clarion call to car producers and oil companies. The fact that Climate Change wasn't mentioned in the Budget speech shows the @theCCCuk is failing.

6359 2018-11-26 15:25:12 I repeat what I  have said repeatedly. Santorum should disclose how much money his lobbying firm gets from oil interests! I think @CNN should be required to tell us that before he pontificates about scientists.

There are those & you know the ones I speak of that use the tar description when criticizing our Energy Sector so be mindful of that!
6404 2018-11-26 15:21:53 This actually resonates with me. With the oil crash, it was crazy to see the gap of support that all the oil companies were filling. It really hurt the non-profit sector.
6405 2018-11-26 15:21:22 This is not a good time for Somalia to take out it's oil. We don't have a strong government yet, army doesn't have full control of the country, our country is still occupied. There is no need to rush, their are other priorities to go after first.

6409 2018-11-26 15:21:12 Coconut oil & breast milk. 
6410 2018-11-26 15:21:07 .@Bhava_Jim Oh so now it's "common sense"?? That was fast. You're not a lawyer. Take your soapbox and go peddle your snake oil elsewhere.
6411 2018-11-26 15:21:03 @GM is citing the @realDonaldTrump tariffs as the reason for closing Ontario and Lordstown. NEOhio Trump voters who crossed over: this is why you don't vote for an idiot. He just cost us jobs. Real jobs. We warned you he was a snake oil salesman.
6412 2018-11-26 15:21:01 bitch just change my@oil!!!! i dont have money!!  for all that extra shit flkdjfkfkd

6414 2018-11-26 15:20:55 Water is the new oil. There will be (are) corporations that control the production and distribution of water (vs sodas for example). One can be pretty self sufficient with electricity production, but salt water is not available beyond a narrow strip along the coast
6415 2018-11-26 15:20:47 I’m confused although oil prices did come down they are now going back up 18%
6416 2018-11-26 15:20:23 Buying oil elsewhere in retaliation of #tariffs
6417 2018-11-26 15:20:16 In most countries, if the advertised product is, say, pancake syrup you are forbidden to use a substitute that behaves better (like motor oil). OTOH, the pancakes in the shot *can* be fake.
6418 2018-11-26 15:20:04 The only items i use for Ashlynn’s hair is organic coconut oil and @MielleOrganics hair milk, mint almond oil, and the kids line for shampoo and conditioner lol.
6419 2018-11-26 15:20:03 Is that president T as in President "T"oxic? Oil runs red in your family.  You keep blaming Obama for supporting Isis without proof, but yet you support a country that is home of terrorist.   You are a TOXIC person.
6420 2018-11-26 15:19:54 I wonder if using cleansing balm like this one, Heimish, Banila Co and etc, do we need to use 2nd cleanser after using cleansing balm? Or boleh je to opt out tak nak pakai?

Cleansing oil mmg kena use another cleanser after, tu saya tahu. Cleansing balm ni confuse sikit haha

Do you experience HEALTH ISSUES outside of your comfort level? 
Everyone needs this oil, I just love HELPING OTHERS, NON-PHYSCOACTIVE, helps ANXIOUS feelings, improve SLEEP, ease PAIN, MIGRAINE and HEADACHE relief, DIGESTION, it supports your IMMUNE & ENDOCRINE
6423 2018-11-26 15:19:36 Today I forgot my coconut oil and had to deal with my mane with just water!  lemme say this long hair lifestyle is just not for me
6424 2018-11-26 15:19:34 They've smell defeat already, so they're trying to gather sympathy.
6425 2018-11-26 15:19:33 Yes there are always legal options. In fact lawyers should make themselves available at low fee or pro bono to file stays until settlement
6426 2018-11-26 15:19:23 It's not a wall in the park. The state governments also have a huge role to play. In my opinion, the fact that asides oil and gas, most of the ports in The South South don't function, is because the governors have no idea of how to make their states profitable
6427 2018-11-26 15:19:23 The oil companies have known the truth about climate change for years but payed their scientists to stay silent.
6428 2018-11-26 15:19:16 Palm Oil itself is actually better for the Environment than many of the alternatives. It's just where it's currently produced and how that's the issue.
6429 2018-11-26 15:19:12 ATM you should already be declaring and paying duty on the percentage of fuel you use for movement. The issue the EU are upset about is effectively keeping heating oil (duty free) & traction oil in the same tank.

6434 2018-11-26 15:18:53 Unfortunately @chrisardinho you forgot 3 precious places in Sumatera.
- Bengkulu, land of the great grand mother of Indonesian’s first lady
- Lampung, rude bus station; land of the handsomest celebrity
- Jambi, the jungle man, 
+ Riau, oil, smokes, hat-trick jailed governor
6435 2018-11-26 15:18:52 Their economy is more than 70% privately owned, so how is that government controlled?

In addition to plunging oil prices, there are also heavy sanctions against Venezuela and that's what's hurting them.
6436 2018-11-26 15:18:52 I should say, "oil struggling", since it's been pinned in the top of the range for more than an hour.
6437 2018-11-26 15:18:52 @marksandspencer can you advise an email address that I can use to find out which M & S food and products does not have any palm oil in please? I cannot find it on your website. Thank you.

6440 2018-11-26 15:18:33 You're not a doctor, yet you give your opinion on abortion.  You're not an immigration attorney, but you talk about immigration law.  You're not a petroleum engineer, but you talk about oil drilling.  Why is this different?  3/3

6444 2018-11-26 15:18:18 Not to excuse this particular decision, only to explain the overall strategy: Like a lot of private businesses, MLB lobbies Congress and uses money to do that. It's a business interest, like the steel industry, or oil/gas, etc.
6445 2018-11-26 15:18:18 Couldn’t a scientist make waaaay more money working for the oil industry?
6446 2018-11-26 15:18:13 Don’t be silly, Giddy! Coconut oil is no match for the magical painting of himself he keeps in the attic. That’s just flopsweat.
6447 2018-11-26 15:18:13 Good timing, oil price is too low, need some stimulation
6448 2018-11-26 15:18:01 Oil price rise giving a boost to US indices with the Dow up 360 points and oil nearly 3% higher. Cryptos sharply lower with Bitcoin 7% weaker.
6449 2018-11-26 15:17:57 I had wisdom teeth surgically removed and ended up with dry socket in all four spots . Literally the worst pain and the clove oil was only thing that made it stop
6450 2018-11-26 15:17:47 I dead ass just ran to the next aisle pretending like I was buying car oil 
6451 2018-11-26 15:17:42 Good point. Oil companies, on the other hand, are more principled.
6452 2018-11-26 15:17:41 Oil prices never drop in Ethiopia. Same when it hit 140 per barell & 45$. They say no changes except up bcz they negotiate ahead. Highly doubt they have global market analysts for that.

6458 2018-11-26 15:17:13 Got off work early and decided to get an oil change. Now I'm talking with strangers about medical marijuana and anxiety/depression.

6460 2018-11-26 15:17:07 Just a few healthy facts about diffusing Lavendar Oil! I use Edens garden! I love them. So affordable and high quality ingredients!
6461 2018-11-26 15:17:01 I have some CBD oil through Posh if you want to try- hit me up!
6462 2018-11-26 15:16:52 But I thought Donald said it's thanks to him that Saudi Arabia is pumping as little oil as possible to keep the prices low...lol. Heads up Donald the world doesn't need oil as much anymore
6463 2018-11-26 15:16:52 Hell rules because you can do whatever you want there! Go to hell! Nuclear power is making dolphins violent! Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!
6464 2018-11-26 15:16:43 FaceTiming my mom on my way to get my oil changed and she says “emilee, aren’t you to the point in your life that you don’t want to be known for big tits and messy hair anymore? Brushing your hair is not an option” damn she’s not playing today
6465 2018-11-26 15:16:35 Maybe he means “natural” gas. Methane. Fart Utilities. It will be like the Matrix with anal plugs.
6466 2018-11-26 15:16:28 Tech sector in Canada is much smaller than RE, homebuilding, oil & gas, mining, etc... It might be resilient but not enough to move the needle.
6467 2018-11-26 15:16:25 I recently got an essential oil diffuser and it’s helping so much with smells and odors in my home, we don’t live with/bear a cigarette smoker but I do think it could help !
6468 2018-11-26 15:16:23 Don’t know if you’ve tried , but swish warm salt water in your mouth especially on side hurting and if you have any put clove oil all on the tooth . Bacteria is causing pain salt water will clear clove oil will numb it up big time

6471 2018-11-26 15:15:57 Chavez tried to save his people. History documents that. There was no other way to go; the Elites we're leaving and all they had was oil. When oil tanked the people suffered and lack of industry was the reason
6472 2018-11-26 15:15:56 How can a country that imports 100% of its oil lose oil worth 2 billion shillings and fake claim train tickets worth 100 million? How is that possible with the current 'fight' against corruption?
6473 2018-11-26 15:15:55 The foolish had oil to start with, since their lamps were going out around midnight. They just didn’t have enough to last. Why do you suppose they didn’t bring extra jars of oil like the wise, to last them through the night?
6474 2018-11-26 15:15:51 Snake oil!
6475 2018-11-26 15:15:51 Omg  fucking loooooove you!!! Trust me I don't understand how I have good skin sometimes lol I don't even wash my face honestly  I just use coconut oil 
6476 2018-11-26 15:15:33 We were doomed when the first coal was mined. We were doomed when the first oil well was drilled. We were doomed when the first internal combustion engine was invented.

6491 2018-11-26 15:14:40 Projection...oil companies have ”bought” climate-denying scientists for decades (just as they bought nicotine and lead denying scientists).
6492 2018-11-26 15:14:30 Calgary vs Ottawa, East vs West, Big oil vs Fed Gov't.  ... isn't it funny how Sports is so closely related to our lives. What's this a coincidence? You decide.

6494 2018-11-26 15:14:23 Alberta Finance Minister Joe Ceci is another politician unable to utter the words Dilbit or Diluted Bitumin. Lame Mainstream Media echo chamber repeats 'oil' and 'crude' in harmony with him as he shrieks about Americans (Koch Bros ?) buying executive jets as Alberta suffers
6495 2018-11-26 15:14:15 Stocks, bonds and commodities from copper to crude oil are staging a rare simultaneous retreat. It’s putting global markets on track for one of their worst years on record and deepening a sense of unease on Wall Street.

6497 2018-11-26 15:14:09 What policy or legislation is hurting media like our government is hurting oil?  The market is there for oil but it’s being choked to death by government.  Not the same for media.
6498 2018-11-26 15:14:02 It looks like Sanctions hurting the regime. Oil prices collapsing too. $100 = 4,389,297.33 Iranian rials.

6501 2018-11-26 15:13:41 When the @CPC_HQ gets elected in 2019 they will make it a priority to get Alberta back on track. It's terrible what's happening Susan, but  prosperity will return to oil rich Alberta.
6502 2018-11-26 15:13:41 I just want to take this moment of time to offer my dearest thank you to the inventors of the ice pack, compression bandage, foam roller, omega 3 fish oil capsule, maca root with ginseng, whey protein powder, aminos, and creatine. What a terrific world we live in because of them
6503 2018-11-26 15:13:39 If the general population found out that coconut oil cured Alzheimer’s, the medical industry that thrives on it would lose money.
6504 2018-11-26 15:13:38 Is there a reference for the pork & beef tallow, Paul? I’ve never come across anything other than whale oil as protection for feet and it would be good to find a reference for earlier treatments.

6506 2018-11-26 15:13:17 this is probably super basic and u might have already tried it but have u looked into CBD oil? it’s a great natural way to help with anxiety and u can get it in cartridges and inhale it or pills, drops, etc i’ve heard it does wonders ! might help w nausea too :)
6507 2018-11-26 15:13:12 The idiot is praising himself today for falling oil prices. Someone should tell him that most of our oil is from Canada, the country that he pisses off. He would love it if his neck was longer so he could kiss his own ass.

6509 2018-11-26 15:12:56 Oil and gas exploration requires research too. Exxon and Chevron hire tons of scientist and chemists and fund plenty of research.
6510 2018-11-26 15:12:55 Let’s not discount Putin on the Iran decision as well as Israel. Higher oil prices helps Russia greatly. Trump gives up the two step of lies and gaslighting. There is no doubt in my mind putin is more instrumental then MSM has been reporting on.

6519 2018-11-26 15:12:00 So do oil companies
6520 2018-11-26 15:11:57 CBD oil would do the trick too, and you won’t get “high”. You can use a hair drier on your cheek like you would use for a child’s ear infection. The clove oil scares me because you can’t swallow it. (This might be a fear only I have tho). God speed dear friend. 
6521 2018-11-26 15:11:54 Some Alberta woman tweeted that if the west separated from , BC would be left to freeze with out Alberta oil.  Yeah ok sure. We got all the wood, lots of electricity, coal and lots and lots of wineries. Beer is on every corner as is weed so yeah I think we are going to be ok.
6522 2018-11-26 15:11:46 My 17 year old F1 obsessed son is looking for a mechanic apprenticeship.

Was wondering if anybody was looking for someone? He's 18 in May and available asap

6525 2018-11-26 15:11:35 Do you not understand that the energy market is crashing? Oil prices dropped nearly 40%. The price of gas has gone down maybe 10 cents a gallon. So the extra $1.50 a week people are keeping in their pockets is a HUGe break. Meanwhile, small oil production companies are at risk.
6526 2018-11-26 15:11:32 New battery

6532 2018-11-26 15:11:07 Makes no sense @WillFealey.  It’s as though the authorities have their heads in the sand - or more likely that dirty oil revenues prevent them from taking real action that will benefit the future of our families and planet.

6534 2018-11-26 15:10:58 The question relates to @gmbutts Frmr employer and his tweets regarding USA climate change groups. The Q: why do USA based environmental groups want to landlock Canada oil but not USA oil?
6535 2018-11-26 15:10:54 Trump:
1) won't criticize MbS for assassinating a US person bc KSA is pumping lots of oil

Do you remember when we were going to run out of oil before the turn of the century? 

What about when the US coast were going to be under 10 ft of water by 2013?

6552 2018-11-26 15:09:37 Trump is nothing but a snake oil selling charlatan. People foolish enough to believe his lies sadly are the ones that are going to pay the biggest price. Gullibility isn't a virtue. It's shooting yourself in the foot.

6555 2018-11-26 15:09:23 Where are you at 50%?

Remaining in the UK has been at least 50% consistently, now that's a good base to build on, not many undecided left to fight over.

Of course what will you campaign on?
EU?
Oil?

You would lose, and lose badly once the reality was known.

6581 2018-11-26 15:07:45 @sarah_humayun and I were wondering the same thing. No one has bothered to go the court on this. Is it because all this supposedly happening under an SC order passed during a suomoto hearing? If true, what are the legal options here?

6587 2018-11-26 15:07:29 So you weren’t listening to the lies Salmond told in 2014 to try to delude people into voting to leave the UK? We were all going to be rich on the back of an oil boom. And rUK would share their currency with us? You missed these claims?
6588 2018-11-26 15:07:28 @BBCRadMac oil rig workers from the outlying areas of Aberdeen have to go there to get the helicopter that carries them away to the north sea for weeks of servitude to the oil companies.. Hence, Aberdoom

6591 2018-11-26 15:07:21 I thought it was designated that any liquid entrained in the gas and is removed in the lease seperators was designeated an oil. It did not matter if it was produced from a gas or an oil well. Lease condensate is entrained oil that drops out when pressure and velocity reduced.
6592 2018-11-26 15:07:17 Just listening to his own words Skippy stated that we must shut down the oil industry to follow through on his global warming plan.

6602 2018-11-26 15:06:18 I wouldn’t exactly call pepper spray a “chemical” since it is directly derived from the oil in peppers. The mother is a child abuser for having dragged those poor children to the border instead of seeking LEGAL entry. Someone needs to teach them the rule of law.
6603 2018-11-26 15:06:18 Interesting, but dies not look at the disastrous effect falling oil prices are having on Venezuela, as a target economy the US wishes to destroy.

6613 2018-11-26 15:05:09 Twenty Million are in need of humanitarian aid in Yemen because of the Saudis-the brutal murder was just an "in your face for USA", and Trump thanks Saudis for oil. Supporting Trump is to support a man who does NOT care for USA or people,he cares for dictators and murderers.

6679 2018-11-26 14:58:25 Get off your fat butt and fire off a challenge to your bed bud, Vlad.  Tell him to quit stirring up trouble, now with Ukraine!  Both of you are nuts.

Why doesn't Vlad get his country to make something in Russia the world wants, other than oil and gas outta the ground?
6680 2018-11-26 14:58:24 Then is he also taking credit for the stock market dropping as a result of the oil price drop?
6681 2018-11-26 14:58:22 Crude oil, uranium, and poison ivy are natural. Shall we spay some on you??

6685 2018-11-26 14:58:13 Can we carve out a piece of Nigeria, a part with no oil reserve and let Oby or Moghalu preside over the affairs. In a decade's time,let compare notes.
6686 2018-11-26 14:58:09 *ดับฝัน
6687 2018-11-26 14:58:06 Yum yum oil have some of them
6688 2018-11-26 14:58:04 Then Sunday we slept in a bit, I cleaned the house he cleaned the garage did my oil change then I made some carne asada tacos for dinner & finished off the night with a movie.
6689 2018-11-26 14:57:59 You are probably confused, if by now, you failed to understand that thier interest is crude oil. Nigeria economy bleeds in a bid to cover up.,If any country decides to have a pig lead them, how do U expect world powers to shout for a group of headless population.
6690 2018-11-26 14:57:57 For betterment of body massage is much necessary.. Mustered oil is far better for children
6691 2018-11-26 14:57:56 Ppl be having cystic acne and y’all on here telling them all they need is black soap and oil smh lordt 
6692 2018-11-26 14:57:54 ดัยฝันเรามากอ่ะ เราพึ่งหวีดไป ฮ่าๆ
6693 2018-11-26 14:57:52 It's more important to the bulk of the nation than not.  How many people are in the oil industry versus not in the industry?   You people do astronomically great in boom times while the rest of us suffer so don't try to sell this crap we ain't buying it.
6694 2018-11-26 14:57:51 But condensate is not an oil. It is an NGL. The US treats condensate as both oil and NGL very similarly to OPEC.
6695 2018-11-26 14:57:48 หืมมมมมม
6696 2018-11-26 14:57:48 Donate household wind and solar energy units to homes in windy and sunny areas to reduce oil dependence. @BillGates @BillNye @elonmusk @solarcity one a day makes a difference. #startsmall
6697 2018-11-26 14:57:36 And rubber bullets and skunk oil...maybe water cannons - whatever it takes.
6698 2018-11-26 14:57:35 WSJ: oil-and-gas extraction support 153k jobs vs 200k in 2014
6699 2018-11-26 14:57:33 Because you both have TDS & can’t accept that you lost. There is nothing wrong with being excited about keeping oil prices down for Americans. Your vitriol for a man you never meant is hurting this country.
Time to love America more than you hate Trump.
6700 2018-11-26 14:57:26 Update: That wasn't one of the tires covered by Warranty. My Brakes were fucked up due to a leak, and the cap for the oil was also leaking and needs to be repaired. So that's fun.
6701 2018-11-26 14:57:23 I bet the oil would then be changed regular like it is supposed to instead of “ya it’s been awhile!”

6704 2018-11-26 14:57:06 When aliens survey our long dead planet they'll find a fuckin' vaginal egg acting as a paperweight on top of oil company funded anti-climate change reports.
6705 2018-11-26 14:57:00 @Petro_Matad 13 dusters, isnt it about time you stopped and tried something different. Oil exploration is simply not for MATD.
6706 2018-11-26 14:57:00 I got essential oil in my eye. It hurt. Don’t do it. It burns. Like really bad. Ugh.
6707 2018-11-26 14:56:49 But if the right gets just one more high on the oil roller-coaster they promise not to piss it all away this time!

6710 2018-11-26 14:56:21 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.
6711 2018-11-26 14:56:18 My dad dropped me off at work and as I was getting out of the car said “don’t spill anything today.” 
So, anyways, just spilled the entire, full essential oil diffuser on myself. Happy Monday!
6712 2018-11-26 14:56:12 Can't ignore the fact US production of Oil/Gas is critical to geo-political strength as a superpower&  great differentiator head-to-head w/China & EU.
Russia & Middle-East lose leverage when USA is strong on Oil/Gas production.
USA & EU shift away from Oil/Gas helps China.

6715 2018-11-26 14:55:55 Okay, so I asked around...it seems CPP may indeed be the pension fund in question. It seems they were short the March #natgas futures to hedge their long crude oil positions and reserve assets. As crude dropped, they were forced to cover for huge losses on the #natgas side...1/2
6716 2018-11-26 14:55:54 The only reason worth waking up early lol. When I need an oil change I’ll get my ass up and fly there lol. In n out less than an hour!
6717 2018-11-26 14:55:51 Also even if it wasn't, a lot of the things that would reduce climate change would be good for humanity regardless.  
Alternative energy sources once we run out of oil.
Reducing pollution to improve everyones health.

But most people don't give a shit anyway. Mind boggling
6718 2018-11-26 14:55:50 I hate coming to get my oil change
6719 2018-11-26 14:55:50 Many have and have been granted. Mexico has its own challenges but the fix is really to help other countries stabilize.  Given there is no oil, we do not bother. Sad
6720 2018-11-26 14:55:28 You want accolades if the sun comes out on a rainy day. So arrogant and egotistical. Oil prices are falling because we (the US not Saudi) are producing more than a million barrels of oil per day. We lead in oil production not Saudi like you indicated. Th US is number 1, Saudi #4

6723 2018-11-26 14:55:11 Since the 2014 plunge in oil prices, no group's been more wrong in their forecasts of a turnaround in the oilfield services sector than oilfield service suppliers themselves. So, is it due to market-place uncertainty or poor forecasting skills of suppliers?

And then California whores love them Texas boys nigga
6729 2018-11-26 14:54:12 C'est très similaire à la razzia réalisée par la Standard Oil en son temps.
Gains de productivité faramineux, baisse drastique du coût pour le consommateur en perspectives.
L'industrie en face est amorphe! Et ce n'est pas un break imposé qui va la réveiller...
6730 2018-11-26 14:54:10 Can’t we stop helping oil barons bomb the shit out of ##Syria #Yemen and #killing #innocent children before we do anything please. It’s been going on for years and we are accomplices and  advocates of slavery as long as we support #humanrights abusers. If they were our children??
6731 2018-11-26 14:54:07 I'm watching @MSNBC with Stephanie Ruhle. She's talking about the report and what we can do to prevent the disaster but focused solely on coal and not on gas and oil. Like coal is more widely used that gas and oil today.
6732 2018-11-26 14:54:02 the lavender is great for relaxation.  I took my friends for mammogram and she was really scared and I got her to put oil a Kleenex and sniff it and she told me all the fear pattern in her brain stopped 
6733 2018-11-26 14:54:02 Only the brilliance of socialism could turn an oil rich country into a place where people are starving to death.  Not even the Saudis could pull that one off!
6734 2018-11-26 14:53:56 Or you could stay in Canada and fix the crisis your government has caused with the oil differential.  You’re far from a leader... you’re a loser. #trudeaumustgo #election2019
6735 2018-11-26 14:53:40 Well, good for you. Your pockets are full while those of us in the oil industry stand to lose our jobs with low oil prices. Thanks President T. Doing bigly greatest things that you are thankful for you.
6736 2018-11-26 14:53:39 I should’ve brought my DS to my oil change omg

6738 2018-11-26 14:53:24 Small dollar increase across the board.  Surprisingly Oil is also up with the dollar and USDJPY having broken 113.0, looks like its being attracted to the next level of resistance of 114.00.  Still seems range bound between 111.00 and 114.00

6745 2018-11-26 14:52:48 i can't figure out why Putin wants cheap oil as it is a yuge Russian export.

But i was never good at 23rd dimensional chess.
6746 2018-11-26 14:52:45 ok so i can't use olive oil apparently bc instead of moisturizing my skin it's drying it even more sigh.. gotta keep looking ig
6747 2018-11-26 14:52:38 Alberta oil is not moving, we are importing oil from Saudis; as was with Harper, Trudeau has no national energy strategy.  Canada is failing economically.  Only difference, aboriginals, environmentalists, Quebecois and all who don’t like to work are holding Trudeau by the balls.
6748 2018-11-26 14:52:29 We hear you. This is a really important issue and we’ve been driving industry-wide change for more than 15 years. We’re on track to meet our goal of sourcing 100% physically certified palm oil by the end of 2019.
6749 2018-11-26 14:52:16 im so inlove w coconut oil
6750 2018-11-26 14:52:12 Congrats!
6751 2018-11-26 14:52:09 Lie. Gas prices were lower under Obama. Plus, we get a small fraction of our oil from Trumps partners in murder, Saudi Arabia and more from Canada.
6752 2018-11-26 14:52:09 Since the oil companies care for profit more than the planet, we should have No Gas Monday and everybody worldwide would not fuel until we get their attention!
6753 2018-11-26 14:52:09 Hi Zoe, since 2015, we have sourced 100% of our palm oil for our own-label food products from sustainable RSPO-certified sources. We are on track to ensure that 100% of palm oil for our own brand non-food products is sourced from RSPO certified sources by the end of 2018. Thanks.
6754 2018-11-26 14:52:07 Active relaxation?!yep! A new recipe .... cold pressed soap but using milk instead of distilled water (a bit more challenging) olive oil infused with calendula flowers, coconut oil, castor oil ... a very gentle soap for the skin ....
6755 2018-11-26 14:52:05 I green lots of green in the markets. The NASDAQ is looks good at the point in time. 

Maybe it will all bounce back, and we will back to a growing economy. 

Naw, oil seems like its still dropping.  

We are all domed! By a electric car....
6756 2018-11-26 14:51:59 The ramifications all over the world are insane. For the profits of purdue our troops guard poppy plants in the middle east. For the profits of Exxon we destabilize any country with nationalized oil. Out of sheer racism we dump a country ontop of Palestine.

He’s not your man, he’s Jack Prigg.
6759 2018-11-26 14:51:52 If the tar sands are failing maybe it is because it was a bad decision from the start propped up by oil prices that are outside of anyone's control besides OPEC. 
Why do we have to bail out employers? Why not bail out employees? ie: EI
6760 2018-11-26 14:51:48 Real hard data on oil not provided by a captured EIA or IEA.....weird ;)
6761 2018-11-26 14:51:48 Need a oil change
6762 2018-11-26 14:51:46 Waiting for an oil change, reading up on how to heal as a Resto Shaman cuz I'm playing one when the guild gets back together on Friday. I love nerdy documentation.
6763 2018-11-26 14:51:43 With news stories of 20 million people's bank accounts unmasked -- if that's true I wonder if globaliists had taken control of their money. We had things like the BP oil spill... if that wasn't an accident globaliists could've threatened to cause more things like that(?)...
6764 2018-11-26 14:51:40 Why don't you give another 40 minutes speech about it? And then go to a fund raiser with some big oil pals.
6765 2018-11-26 14:51:32 Sometimes you go unconscious holding a donut
6766 2018-11-26 14:51:30 Iran condy as well as ALL OPEC condy ought to be treated as oil, but OPEC doesn’t....and yet Russia includes its condy for “cut compliance...” seems like raw deal of ya ask me seems like all biz is included bc Iraq “needs” waiver to buy Iran gas for electricity generation...

6768 2018-11-26 14:51:27 Last week, the price of Brent crude fell 11.9%. While this is a boost to consumers, it is likely to slow the development of the US oil industry which has been a significant driver of the USA’s economic growth.
6769 2018-11-26 14:51:26 Its sad to see a progressive & oil rich country -- Venezulea sliding into choas & anarchy.

6772 2018-11-26 14:51:00 No one wants to admit it but auto industry, like oil industry, will change a lot over next 10 to 20 years. Time for everyone to look at new opportunities in new technologies instead of clinging to 20th century industries. It was a good run but it couldn't last forever.
6773 2018-11-26 14:50:50 Heartland takes money from industry lobbyists -like tobacco- and creates positive spin for a fee.  They wrote lots of material defending the health benefits of smoking cigarettes.  They're also funded by the oil & coal industries for spinning hoax tales. I said RELIABLE sources.

6775 2018-11-26 14:50:42 You know I’m not the snake oil type Graham. We are using all our knowledge, experience and intelligence, from inside and outside our bubbles to solve complex problems often with fuzzy boundaries.
6776 2018-11-26 14:50:40 The Butts-Liberal agenda is to destroy the oil & gas industry and replace it with "clean" energy-  a misguided fantasy in current times.  Everything Liberals say and do is contrived to create confusion about their true intentions.

6780 2018-11-26 14:50:22 If President Trump could take Adderall on time thus stopping to tweet about Stocks and Crude oil, it'd be fantastic.
6781 2018-11-26 14:50:22 Everyone in the Nationalist GOP party is on the payroll of big oil and gas.  He fits right in with all the climate science deniers.

6787 2018-11-26 14:50:03 Speaking about natural energy is akin to talking about transfer of kinetic energy through the wind and whatnot. If you are talking about shale, coal and oil you're referring to resources to provide that energy (usually through burning those resources to pump a turbine)

6792 2018-11-26 14:49:39 The boom in energy company share buybacks is linked to conditions in Western Canada, where a lack of pipeline capacity to carry away growing production has resulted in unprecedented discounts in oil prices versus U.S. benchmarks, said Eric Nuttall, at Ninepoint Partners.

6796 2018-11-26 14:48:58 But if you think that, and I dont disagree with your premise, then the economy we have is truly not the free market then. Governments should stop subsidizing oil and allow true free market competition to occur. its hard to criticize the free market when we dont have a free market
6797 2018-11-26 14:48:50 Coal is a dead energy, not renewable, not green. Scottish nationalists spoke of the Scottish oil but also no longer want it. The GDP of London alone dwarfs Scotland, where I study. The GDP of London is double that of Scotland as a whole. Natural resources are old hat.
6798 2018-11-26 14:48:48 This BS has been going on for two years and all Muller has done is arrest a few people for a minor lie or tax evasion lol. Time for Muller to put up or the left to shut up. Your about as original as snake oil salesmen.

6808 2018-11-26 14:47:57 We Buhari Supporters are not saying he is upright without weaknesses, but you can clearly understand that he started serving this nation when he was just 19 till now, yet he has no oil blocs, no off shore accounts, no private Companies or Universities, no concubines
6809 2018-11-26 14:47:56 More projection, right? It’s those who pursue $$$ at all costs who deny climate change (oil, gas, coal ...).

“CNN’s Santorum ...” makes me 
6810 2018-11-26 14:47:55 No oil...
6811 2018-11-26 14:47:48 Tax cut for wealthy jacks up deficit then used to justify cutting medicare & social security. Wages stagnant, stock market down, tariffs backfired, you're a failure but think you should tell Fed what to do. Big reason oil prices down? Political, you sanctioned murder (Khashoggi).

6813 2018-11-26 14:47:43 This is an industry infrastructure issue. Nat gas is still considered a byproduct of oil production in too many places. Where the federal gov't can help is easing pipeline permits and FERC regulatory hurdles.
6814 2018-11-26 14:47:37 T21 จ้า
6815 2018-11-26 14:47:35 But isn't that also, like, the fate of fossil fuel jobs? We can't prop up fossil fuel. If the projects aren't viable as businesses why would the tax payer, the rest of Canada that has disdain for the oil sands, support it?
Isn't stronger EI better than bailing out failed biz?

6820 2018-11-26 14:47:15 I've just checked some of what I have in the kitchen and bathroom. And am shocked to find palm oil is in my toothpaste, shampoo, my butter, noodles, gravy granules. And doubtless lots more in my cupboards..#PalmOil

6829 2018-11-26 14:46:43 Most think Chanukah is all about G-d preforming a miracle in the Temple over 2,200 years ago. Allowing 1 day of oil to last 8 days. But it’s actually all about G-d Continuing to work & preform His Miracles in His Temple (us) even today.

Building pipelines to our coasts open us up to the world market (China, EU, GB) once we are able to sell our oil to people who need it

I think  little old Heid's charts are original and i think cool..
6839 2018-11-26 14:45:43 I see a lot of folks aren’t sure what to make of the wonderful news about record US oil production—some seem to think it means we can be energy independent and no longer need OPEC countries like Saudi Arabia as allies. Let me explain very briefly why that’s not the case. (1)
6840 2018-11-26 14:45:41 If you read some Bible commentaries you won't want to be Judas in the story of the alabaster oil over the Dunamis building.
6841 2018-11-26 14:45:31 What a schmuck. During the 2000 election I realized that oil prices are a political football, going up and down 2 evoke a visceral response and support for the oil company's kronys. Just another pocket you inhabit.
6842 2018-11-26 14:45:31 But haven’t you heard? If you mix 1 part olive oil to 2 parts unicorn turd and rub it on your child’s knee you can cure most, nay ALL diseases.

6848 2018-11-26 14:44:54 You understand we have 12 years to make this not an oil world right?
Like, not "Peter is dreaming of a world without oil", but rather, if we don't shift away from oil in the next 12 years, billions of humans will die. 
(and none of that is hyperbole)

6864 2018-11-26 14:43:36 I am just so sick of money-grubbing planet-killers, wars for oil (& opium) that turn historical sites into rubble & kill innocent people for profit.  I honestly believe religion would be brought into question if we learned the truth, so they destroy it.

6873 2018-11-26 14:42:56 You would be surprised how the price point isnt the factor.  It's the oil industries propaganda against them.
6874 2018-11-26 14:42:52 He is right in one respect. The scientists that work for big oil ARE politically and financially driven to lie about the science behind climate! The vast majority of scientists do science to learn about our universe. Not for money or politics you cynical POS!
6875 2018-11-26 14:42:49 Oil price is kinda low, wallet empty, what do you do!
6876 2018-11-26 14:42:48 Buddy, we live in an oil world. There is no collective alternative today. Until there is, it’s an oil world. Get over it. Demand for oil is rising, not shrinking.

6882 2018-11-26 14:42:14 And let’s remember that since the US supplies a fraction of oil, the President has ZERO to do with oil prices. Simple economics can’t fight the BS his cult will believe, unfortunately
6883 2018-11-26 14:42:14 The texture ... especially after using coconut oil ...
6884 2018-11-26 14:42:13 Yes, lower oil prices offer some help with gas prices, but also hurt the oil industry and it's employees. 

REMOVING TAXES from Gas Prices would drive them back down to $1/gal.  approx. .70 of each $1 spent on Gasoline/Petrol is Local, City, County, State & Federal taxes.

6947 2018-11-26 14:37:35 Thank God the Fed doesn't listen to you. And I'm sure all of our domestic oilfield workers are super stoked about the falling oil prices. They're your base, you know.
6948 2018-11-26 14:37:27 @AndrewScheer @CandiceBergenMP , well firstly man made  climate change is a nassive un fraud that  has long been proven and exposed @HeartlandInst , secondly if you really were comcerned about building a strong economy the oil pipeline wouldnt have been such a politiical screwup
6949 2018-11-26 14:37:14 THIS BITCH SMELLS BIT NASTY BCS OF OIL BUT I LOVE TUNA SO IT BETTER TASTE GOOD I NEVER EAT CANNED TUNA BEFORE
6950 2018-11-26 14:37:04 A country with oil is a country to spoil. And if they care for their poor we'll spoil it some more.
6951 2018-11-26 14:37:00 kfc遠いんですけどね…
6952 2018-11-26 14:37:00 1/2:Thanks babe. I've never used Cantu. I'm a simple girl. I use a glycerine and water sprits paired with a treatment or a leave-in (when I do wash and go's). Sometimes I used a cream and seal it with oil - when I do flexirods or twist-outs.
6953 2018-11-26 14:36:47 What’s interesting about these agricultural numbers are taken from production to end product. This is not taken into consideration when assessing transportation, as in building said car/bus or even production of oil, petroleum or diesel.Also grass sequestered CO2 isn’t considered
6954 2018-11-26 14:36:33 BP Oil neglected to install a $500,000 cut-off valve and ended up paying $20billion (and counting) in damages. Capitalism, coupled with a completely amoral executive populace, will be the death of the world.
6955 2018-11-26 14:36:29 @Cdn_Eliana  Do you actually believe "eco activists are funded by oil interest in the US who also has ties to Saudi Arabia...so it would be ill advised for them to go against their employers"  Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, Ecojustice take the petroleum corp to court .
6956 2018-11-26 14:36:26 Nope! for three reasons:-

1. Stop using palm oil
2. Pay your taxes
3. Your chocolate is horrible now.

Okidoke?

6966 2018-11-26 14:35:32 So, you're happy that U.S. oil companies are losing? #trumpfail #babytrump
6967 2018-11-26 14:35:27 -Grapes need to be crushed to make wine. 
-Diamonds form under pressure.  
-Olives are pressed to release oil.
-Seeds grow in darkness.

Feeling crushed? Under pressure? Pressed? In a dark place? This is where the magic happens. You’re in a powerful place. KEEP GOING.

6986 2018-11-26 14:33:46 I tire for you Mr. Buhari... Face reality and see the suffering and despicable plight of the citizenry. Infrastructure indeed. Common electricity we don't have and yet we are an oil and gas producing nation. I am so disappointed in you.

7002 2018-11-26 14:32:17 One of those DOPES @BNNBloomberg mentions Fed money to GM in ON, oil patch in AB, pipeline in BC, but not a thought for BBD, the deepest hole of all. deplorable, despicable, detestable dope.
7003 2018-11-26 14:32:15 The fall in Brent and Nymex crude oil prices ranges from 33% and 30% respectively since their peak in 1st week of Oct2018--which is likely to further dent the excise duty collections from petrol / diesel. The fisc is already under stress due to less than expected GST collections.

7006 2018-11-26 14:32:05 @realDonaldTrump What about the stock market decline. We will need more than tax cuts and reduced oil prices to make up for what the middle income are losing with this major decline.
7007 2018-11-26 14:31:59 They’re paid to protest Canadian oil by US competitors. While ours is land locked, & we have one customer (as they want), we import from the US, Saudi Arabia & Venezuela,yet you believe they’re motivated by environmental protection? I have some fresh mountain air to sell ya. 
7008 2018-11-26 14:31:58 Have you ever heard of oil?  Protecting America and Americans interest?
7009 2018-11-26 14:31:53 Like a place where oil springs up from the ground if you dig and you can fly on a magic carpet?
7010 2018-11-26 14:31:45 What do U thing about the latest report of the toxic ecological legacy of oil corporations in AB. As well are you suggesting that barbaric dictators should lead in ecological responsibility. Fed gov has failed to perform responsible Env Assessments in Canada  U.S. also IMMORAL
7011 2018-11-26 14:31:34 Why are some vegetarians/vegans so angry that people are becoming more aware about palm oil/agriculture etc because they still eat meat? Becoming aware and spreading awareness is the first step to a better world!! The more people talk about it the more awareness is spread!!!?

7017 2018-11-26 14:31:01 You may not agree with what they are doing but it is very disingenuous to say govt does NOTHING to help the Oilsands. Lots of subsidies, we bought a damn pipeline plus WE GIVE THEM THE OIL.

7036 2018-11-26 14:28:33 We ensure the palm oil we buy is produced on legally held land, does not lead to deforestation or loss of peat land, respects human rights and does not use forced or child labor. We continue to implement our Palm Oil Action Plan.  We achieved RSPO certification 3 years early.
7037 2018-11-26 14:28:28 As is the UN Security Counsel. US, RU, CH are pretending to be at odds while stealing the world blind.

7043 2018-11-26 14:28:09 Excellent point.  For the most part the President - ANY President - has little to do with how oil prices or the economy goes.   Oil prices do what they do.   Always have, always will.
7044 2018-11-26 14:28:03 We’re leading the way in securing a sustainable palm oil supply – 100% of our palm oil is sustainably produced. At the end of 2017, 96% of our palm oil was traceable back to mill and 99% was from suppliers with policies aligned to ours.

7055 2018-11-26 14:27:17 And of course, oil prices falling have nothing to do with China's stalling economy and consumption.

7060 2018-11-26 14:26:56 As long as big companies like you continue to use palm oil, whether it is responsibly sourced or not, deforestation to grow it will continue.

7091 2018-11-26 14:24:42 After last week’s tech wreck and oil price rout, there’s lots of political news that could influence investors this week, including the G-20, a planned Fed speech, and a potential rethink on Italy. Join us for a lively discussion tonight on The Living Markets at 6 p.m.
7092 2018-11-26 14:24:40 Wallahi Akwai su dayawa ma. It’s just that we all like to generalize everything
7093 2018-11-26 14:24:34 yeah well no oil income & if you join a weekly membership fee for the EU so good luck you'll need it

7096 2018-11-26 14:24:26 Hundreds of thousands of dead Iraqis and American soldiers for oil profits.
7097 2018-11-26 14:24:22 And people wanted to put further punitive measures on Saudi Arabia. Imagine what kinds of riots would happen in the west if the Saudi's decided to stop exporting oil. People just don't think things through, they want to act rashly out of emotion
7098 2018-11-26 14:24:22 Twitter, Facebook, Amazon should sit down and analyze what happened to Standard Oil.

If Congress had the balls it would be underway right now.
7099 2018-11-26 14:24:16 I'm tired, not working, but about to get my hands dirty w some oil paint today
7100 2018-11-26 14:24:14 I did not say anything on Trumo. His approach to middle-east peace is new with good relationship with Saudi & efforts to topple Iran regime. His motive isn't to "control" oil prices either like fake news says. But his policies help keep prices in check by US suppliers

7132 2018-11-26 14:22:08 Facts are that oil is not trading at a discount elsewhere.  Canadian oil takes a heavy decrease due to limited pipe capacity and the additional cost to ship by rail.  I invite you to check into it.

7134 2018-11-26 14:22:03 A single $5,000 donation, by itself, might not mean much.  But an environment where taking money from oil companies is a regularly accepted feature of our politics likely indicates that we're being too kind to an industry that needs to be radically shrunk, against its will.
7135 2018-11-26 14:21:55 Jagmeet has been very clear about helping oil workers transition to green energy jobs - which are booming right now.
7136 2018-11-26 14:21:53 I keep reading about oil industry making more money because they do not want to go green. If we stop using oil......what do you replace it with now......not 20 years from now but rigth now. Besides killing thousands of jobs across the globe what will we use now in the present.
7137 2018-11-26 14:21:47 I guess no one remembers when the price of oil went down and the liberals imposed a tax so that the decrease was not felt at the pump.

7141 2018-11-26 14:21:03 We can only dream about the strong economy we would have today if it weren't for Harper's tenure of failure. Harper had 9 years as PM but could not build a single pipeline to the west coast freeing Alberta oil. That level of incompetence is hard to fathom.
7142 2018-11-26 14:21:03 Yeah, Im sure it can be done, BUT I wouldn't be surprised that the big oil companies are behind the plastics industry, to sell the byproducts of petrolium production to make plastics. I'm just guessing but would not be surprised if I'm right.

7161 2018-11-26 14:19:33 Honestly the best part of Paw Patrol is how one episode they are getting a chicken out of a tree and the next cleaning up a massive oil spill from a leaking tanker with equal ease.
7162 2018-11-26 14:19:26 So, Trump suggesting a good relationship with the Saudis keeps oil prices for Americans low and hence justifies an easing of pressure - that's not true because the Saudis have no influence on US oil prices?
7163 2018-11-26 14:19:26 Okay but the oil spill one is still iconic

7214 2018-11-26 14:14:40 it doesn't rly bc i feel like it would've been a lot more expensive 100 yrs ago, but i also hav to factor in that it would've been purchased in france, where it was likely made local, so maybe not crazy expensive. i never thought id hav so many questions abt lavender oil.

7252 2018-11-26 14:11:04 Wrong. But a city worker would have this perception. Probably unionized.  Take a step into West Texas/South New Mexico and talk to the men and women in the oil fields.  Or get on the extremely bias google and read a fact or two that can’t be construed.

7302 2018-11-26 14:07:42 It is achievement. 1 month ago Bolomberg Magazine said it was very hard to achieve even selling storaged oil. Though Sudis achieved with success but one month ago we had been talking it maybe not enough? Is it enough? Or it is just breaking hard train for slowing it down yearly.
7303 2018-11-26 14:07:40 And yet Morgan Stanley has just come out with a report that US refinery capacity for light shale oil is being maxed out as most US refiners are set up to process heavier oil. Hard to keep up with the many narratives out there.

7361 2018-11-26 14:03:40 This is more to do with Trump and his moronic tariffs. Harper bailed out GM with the provision that GM must keep operations in Canada for a certain amount of time. I've read that time is up. This has nothing to do with Trudeau or the oil industry that he's doing nothing to hurt.
7362 2018-11-26 14:03:36 I ordered through the drive thru, I ordered my sandwich, which came out find, but when I got to the window. I asked them if they could add on another sandwich make it the same way, (oil & vineger, mustard, etc)

7367 2018-11-26 14:03:23 I've seen parallels in Francophone's political wins and CCP political wins.

CCP uses Taiwan to shame the US for control. Francophones/Aboriginals shames their US neighbors who were too busy manage islamic terrorists which Canada openly harbours to spite the US for oil control.
7368 2018-11-26 14:03:19 Ça montre surtout le Q.I. d'huître de ces #GiletsJaunes agresseurs, même pas capables de se rendre compte que sans le matraquage quotidien de la TV et de la radio, leur mouvement n'aurait pas dépassé quelques blocages locaux, le temps que le prix du gas oil fonde.

7404 2018-11-26 14:01:16 What money?!

We hear this argument all the time from climate change deniers, but it makes no sense.

On the other hand, climate change deniers NEED climate change to be ignored because there is BIG $ in businesses that contribute to global change. (Big oil, manufacturing, etc)

7430 2018-11-26 13:59:25 But God loves Israel, that's why he didn't give them oil. Oil is a curse. No country with oil has experienced peace in totality.

7442 2018-11-26 13:58:45 Let's be realistic about climate change. It is slow and subtle. Most humans will reject the scientific facts that we are heading slowly but surely to the next Great Extinction. There are no ways now to avoid it. We needed to stop all coal mining and most of oil drilling years ago
7443 2018-11-26 13:58:45 (my understanding is cast iron pan seasoning is polymerized oil so maybe an open flame is better at getting the oil to polymerize? i dunno, not a chemist, just noticed that the pan got in better shape upon switching back to gas)

7454 2018-11-26 13:58:07 So when it comes to people in need, the US gets very hesitant to enter, when it comes to oil and money, US sends troops immediately

7459 2018-11-26 13:57:42 [Fitness Tip]

Do NOT skip meals.

Not eating slows down metabolism, you don't burn calories as efficiently, and when you do eat, foods are more likely to be stored as fat

It's like a car on low oil; It will run, but not effectively & eventually the car is going to be run down.
7460 2018-11-26 13:57:30 Low loonie that more than makes up for all of those (except when oil prices are high and the petroloonie kills manufacturing for export).
7461 2018-11-26 13:57:29 I know how to check the oil://

7480 2018-11-26 13:55:39 @Varneyco Sorry Stuart, but $50.00 oil will begin production slowing by U.S. oil companies.  These are the independent oil companies who produce almost all of our oil and gas.  They cannot make a profit at $50 or less. If oil prices stay at this price you'll see decrease in oil.
7481 2018-11-26 13:55:36 A global issue though, around 3% of total palm oil exports went to US in 2017 (Oil World). Also both Indonesia and Malaysia are promoting palm oil biodiesel domestically.

7489 2018-11-26 13:54:56 Hi. Just wondering why there isnt any revision on the fuel pricing since the oil has plunged by almost 20usd since early November. Is weakening ringgit to be blamed? And how is Petronas coping?

7524 2018-11-26 13:51:43 The very idea that man can change the warming of the planet is ludicrous. 
200 years ago, every living thing on the planet burnt wood to eat, to keep warm etc. 
Now that we are not burning all that wood, the world is warmer??They are the newest snake oil salesman from the 1800’s

7526 2018-11-26 13:51:38 #oott sometimes we forget what happened. Saudi Arabia agreed to raise supply steeply in June, in response to calls from consumers, including the United States and India, to help cool oil prices and address a supply shortage after Washington imposed sanctions on Iran. ınteresting?
7527 2018-11-26 13:51:34 very correct. alternatively the THC can be properly extracted by cooking with oil on low heat, or also by mashing the grass properly with little butter and cooking "in" water on low heat as well. the water left after the second method would also contain THC

7569 2018-11-26 13:47:26 Please advise where you get your statistics from.  Oil prices, which rose in the last two years are finally down to where they were before your election.  So who was responsible for them being higher?  And inflation does not seem to be down.

7571 2018-11-26 13:47:23 If you look at oil companies, they have tens of billions each at stake so we look at them for resistance. Similarly, trillions of investment globally are being directed by climate science and hundreds of billions of subsidies.  Look at who makes money from it.

7661 2018-11-26 13:40:15 It was the same in Alberta. Oil takes a massive hit. Big oil companies lay people off and it trickles down through the economy. Service companies, suppliers, manufacturing. Sucks for everyone. Liberals need to go.

7849 2018-11-26 13:25:27 Government bond prices ended lower today on rise in crude oil prices. Traders worried over a likely output cut by OPEC in the December 6 meeting. Profit booking by some market players also weighed on bond prices.

7923 2018-11-26 13:20:57 well, in this case they aren't WRONG, exactly.  just overzealous.  There is no such thing as canola, the plant.  Canola was a name made up because marketing had a hard time selling " rapeseed" oil.

7925 2018-11-26 13:20:28 The next two weeks are potentially big for clarity on: 1) Fed - Powell speech in NYC 11/28, 2) Trade - G20 meeting in Buenos Aires 11/30, and 3) Oil - OPEC meeting in Vienna 12/6.  We look for equities to firm on these developments.  #PerspectiveProvider
7926 2018-11-26 13:20:19 Europe props up Putin by buying his oil and building his pipelines (GERMANY!!!). EU responsible 4 Putin keeping power. Putin is daring @NATO . If NATO folds, it emboldens Putin. Putin will push until somebody pushes back. Fight back or fold like a cheap chair.
7927 2018-11-26 13:20:13 You should be applying sanctions to the Saudis, not thanking them for oil prices. They murdered an American journalist. Do you comprehend that?
7928 2018-11-26 13:19:45 Let me guess!! Free money free health care let invaders in by the millions  listen to the UN and ban oil and cars. Did I miss anything?
7929 2018-11-26 13:19:39 #echo hit 18p on an oil strike of a 500m oil column, stimulation on the well to commence within 2 weeks if it flows well it flys past 18p, huge assets, producer, over £20m in cash, last placing at 12p, seller cleared, very strong buy imo
7930 2018-11-26 13:19:30 The federal government has no part in oil prices and the companies ability to ship the products. They do now because they invested in Alberta with a pipeline... Stop being so Albertan and see what reality is
7931 2018-11-26 13:19:22 Trump are we suppose to be grateful that the gruesome murder of an American Journalist was bargained for lowered oil prices?

7959 2018-11-26 13:17:54 Shale cannot be swing supplier or in other words US tight oil cannot be antidote to oil price volatility because changes in tight oil production emerges only as a result of change in price.

7976 2018-11-26 13:16:12 Iran’s oil export have fallen from 4million barrels per day to under 1 million barrels and that has had a big effect on its economy. Now cheaper oil means : more pressure on Iran. Only reason for Saudi to up its output

8000 2018-11-26 13:14:09 This one is a hot button topic. The line is already there and it supplies the entire upper peninsula with nat gas, oil, and crude tar. It's a two-way line bringing crude tar down and nat gas up. Having worked on portions of that line, I know that the transport is safe.
8001 2018-11-26 13:14:04 We are now at the stage other things are cheaper than oil, so oil will go naturally, with a push.
8002 2018-11-26 13:14:00 Pardon the phrase, but that's bullsquirt. @MDLZ , also owned by Kraft, hides critical palm oil sourcing data behind a corporate screen. Until full scrutiny is possible, your assurances remain meaningless. You still put your short term gains before all our long term interests.
8003 2018-11-26 13:13:50 IMO, like a car, if you put water in the oil tank, it is a matter of time before the plates of the earth stop working properly.   Prepare for more earthquakes in ME.

8032 2018-11-26 13:10:58 the thing about predators is their numbers are dictated by the prey species numbers a lot of predators usually means an equally large number of prey to sustain them - but then you get the oil seed rape wood pigeon factor -
8033 2018-11-26 13:10:52 Thank goodness I don't have stocks in the oil industry.
8034 2018-11-26 13:10:41 LOEs are about to fall back down along with oil price and PDP declines are offset by new drilling (just less of it) post peak. Easy to model... NPV positive in the aggregate.

8054 2018-11-26 13:08:37 yes. you drench your hair in oil as a pre treatment before washing it. shampoo dries your hair so it combats that. it's not entirely necessary but i do it bc i have a very very dry scalp and hair.
8055 2018-11-26 13:08:36 This is not a new news ....this is an old story that cut across many past presidents and govt officials. Is the worst corruption case ever recorded in the world oil industry.

8067 2018-11-26 13:07:58 I forgot the military aspect: exporting oil keeps our allies in Europe for having to buy volatile Mid East oil and from having to buy from Russia who will threaten them otherwise. 

That's right - your "Orange Putin Puppet" is using oil to drive Europe away from Putin's sphere 
8068 2018-11-26 13:07:54 Input is based on proven science. Anyone who could disprove it would make a fortune (& win a Nobel) - there is more money in oil than climate science. Yet you are so certain you are right & all scientists wrong you don't even want more research. Sorry; not worth listening to.

8072 2018-11-26 13:07:33 Dear President T, as you are the most brilliant man alive, you know that falling oil price due to sagging demand is an alarm-bell for recession, right? I appreciate your taking the blame for the recession. It is nice to see you accepting responsibility for things.

8075 2018-11-26 13:06:55 That’s why Pelosi is having trouble getting Speaker. She’s taken oil money and voted that way. She’s taken bank money and voted that way. Lobbyists must be taken out of politics so every voice is equal.

8083 2018-11-26 13:06:03 But, we’ve had this relationship with them for as long as I have been alive. It’s not just DJT. Besides oil, why are we so blind to their evils?

8089 2018-11-26 13:05:24 You're comparing a man trying to stop a potential genocide in Israel to an event where millions were killed because of oil, and saying that the former is a "contemporary evil" whilst the latter is a "rhetorical device". Stop being utter scum and see some sense.
8090 2018-11-26 13:05:17 C'mon, what's a bot gotta do to get an oil fix around here?

8094 2018-11-26 13:05:06 I will agree that what he said during the campaign was terribly inappropriate and wrong.
What he said there was targeting an individual and not a minority group. It of course was still wrong of him to say.

The US is in deep with Saudi, Dem or GOP dont matter there. (yummy oil)

8149 2018-11-26 13:00:18 Point is, if a news program chooses topic of climate change,the panel shd include scientists, not partisan political pundits.

8155 2018-11-26 12:59:39 Um no, it requires big oil to stop thinking they own the planet.

8163 2018-11-26 12:58:22 The fact that over the years Norway built up an oil fund is an irrelevance right now. It was done over a completely different economic model than the U.K., and isn’t something that can be started today and built up.
8164 2018-11-26 12:58:11 You 'don't really care' what the real story is, but you took offence to someone pointing out the absurdity of a fan whose profile pic is an oil barrel overflowing with cash 'backing Abu Dhabi's legal processes' on the basis that 'well, not everyone gets locked up you know'?

The Cauldron tofu is good fried up with some red onions in a bit of stir-fry oil (for me). Also chestnut mushrooms in a dish /
8169 2018-11-26 12:57:50 But, now that oil prices are falling in part because Trump supports murderous regimes, the viability of coal should certainly be... non-existent

8189 2018-11-26 12:55:41 efek harga oil turun itu bisa dilihat dari 2 sisi:

1. merugikan oil producer secara langsung dan ke serco. tapi di sisi lain renewables dirugikan karena oil udh establish duluan. ibaratnya path to least resistance makin gmpang ditempuh.

8198 2018-11-26 12:54:56 Oh come on Jay. Someone like you who has lived and worked in the oil sector knows how many jobs a project like that employs, whether directly or indirectly. Just because you don’t like conservatives doesn’t change the impact on the economy.
8199 2018-11-26 12:54:47 @CNN President Putin is employing same SWAGGER & BULLYING this country has "flashed" in various parts of world for DECADES!! When it comes to labeling committing lives for OIL & POPPY-FIELDS "fighting TERROR", WH passes neither SMELL nor LAUGH test! Our motives are clear.

8213 2018-11-26 12:53:21 Correct ur claim was that 2.7 million immigrants couldnt work in oil
8214 2018-11-26 12:53:17 No, you can't tell me that a group of people who didn't complete projects in 16 years with high oil price is the same with a group that is completing them in 3 and a half years with low oil price.
I will not accept that lame line of argument.

Anyone who responds negatively to lower oil prices and lower taxes is a brick shy of a load. Just saying.

8312 2018-11-26 12:43:37 And I think it’s fair to call out lobbyists and others receiving funds from the fossil fuels industries.  The major oil companies understood the science in the 1980s very well, but didn’t work to change their businesses.  Instead they fought regulation.

8372 2018-11-26 12:38:05 Seems like plenty of climate deniers have tenure at big oil, big coal, and anyone else who has a vested interest in short term returns from unsustainable industry
8373 2018-11-26 12:38:05 I think you might be half right. 98% of oil and gas exports from Canada is going to the US, but I don't think that accounts for 90% of US imports.
Price per gallon is also 4,50$ CAD
8374 2018-11-26 12:37:53 Yeah, I’m saying we shouldn’t be proud based on the fact that we aren’t doing well on any of those metrics. For a oil producing company, we shouldn’t be ranking 132nd in electricity supply when our neighbours have cracked it.

8393 2018-11-26 12:36:05 And here we get to opportunity costs.  Every minute wasted on pipelines, oil, and other legacy , is a minute that we aren't getting ahead of the game. The opportunity costs of handholding AB through the oil industry transition are huge.

So, what we do? This is tough.
8394 2018-11-26 12:35:58 Well it’s certainly true, but then the oil and gas industry doesn’t help by buying the patents for each and every environmentally positive invention so they never see the light of day. We could have been using water or something similar as fuel all this time.

8409 2018-11-26 12:33:50 It’s funny you should say this @HillaryClinton . It’s the wars and disruption incited by the US in pursuit of oil and military power, that has displaced all these people (from their homelands)who seek refuge in Europe. The problems lies where you stand.
8410 2018-11-26 12:33:48 If oil prices are falling, why is gas on the rise? And if oil prices actually are falling, how did you do it? By making nice with the Saudi Arabians, after they killed an American journalist?

8476 2018-11-26 12:27:09 1. Pemerintah sepakat untuk melakukan penyesuaian pungutan ekspor oleh Badan Pengelola Dana Perkebunan Kelapa Sawit (BPDP-KS) terhadap Crude Palm Oil (CPO) dan produk turunannya. Pasalnya, harga CPO belakangan ini terus menurun hingga 23 November 2018 menyentuh angka 410 USD/Ton.
8477 2018-11-26 12:27:00 Are we gonna chase more WMD around the oil oasis again?
8478 2018-11-26 12:26:56 I asked u for industries than oil that keep Scotland afloat and before the lil was discovered wat kept the tax's coming in 250 years of UK MEMBERSHIP
8479 2018-11-26 12:26:53 England has stolen all its money, the reality is, the tax has come from the petrol pumps and finished products at refineries.

In addition to this there are huge clean up costs associated with the oil industry and a lot of decommissioning is taking place.

So when you add up.....
8480 2018-11-26 12:26:52 @RachelNotley @JustinTrudeau you say you are losing $100M per day due to 300K of stranded oil.  Temporarily offer $10 per bl to shut in prod.  Surely Ott and AB can fund $3M to save $100M.  Don't over complicate this....the answer is right in front of you. #OOTT #Canada
8481 2018-11-26 12:26:42 Was Trudeau suppose to buy the oil companies?

8486 2018-11-26 12:25:58 The problem is that water, like oil, is currently priced without regard to sustainability. In many regions, we’ve rapidly consumed groundwater that will take thousands of years for nature to replenish. Water MUST cost more  before society will develop sustainable water practices.
8487 2018-11-26 12:25:53 @IcelandFoods it's good you've taken palm oil out, now for carrageenan..nasty ingredient.
8488 2018-11-26 12:25:53 hahahahaha oil fck
8489 2018-11-26 12:25:49 Again. @CNNPolitics why is @RickSantorum allowed to speak? He has no credentials to speak on climate change?
Believing in oil companies the way some believe in God, shouldn’t give him the right to spread disinformation

8494 2018-11-26 12:24:40 The way I see it Saudi just voted to cut OPEC oil output because of slowing world demand. This typically signals a slowing world economy, hence lower oil prices. The Obama/Yellen policies that drove the US market up 10,000 points in 8 years has been compromised by this admin.
8495 2018-11-26 12:24:38 I will take the integrity of a scientist and more importantly of the scientific community over a politician any day. No motivation on the fossil fuel side with literally trillions of dollars of oil in the ground that would be worthless if we were 100% renewable.
8496 2018-11-26 12:24:31 Don't worry, we don't need you to have FREEDOM or DEMOCRACY. We don't have any oil !
8497 2018-11-26 12:24:30 Isn't the US oil industry already massively overproduced?
8498 2018-11-26 12:24:28 So Trump wants rates lower, and now saying he cooperated with SA to get oil lower. Hmm. Not saying anything just an observation!

8503 2018-11-26 12:23:55 Thanks for pointing out. Yes its a disastrous program which I came to know when IISC was showing off Pepsico CSR project for bio fuel some 6 months back

Frankly speaking Bio Fuel is biggest disaster - be it palm oil or sea weed - journey to bio fuel will cause destruction only!

8506 2018-11-26 12:23:48 I think being offgrid is one of the unique and beneficial features which @OFTEC can promote. Oil is great to link with the solar thermal store. If gas gridd goes down and electricity grid goes down a simple PV system keeps everything ticking along.
8507 2018-11-26 12:23:44 In tax income after 20yrs of surplus. From oil. While tax on gas is generally loaded at the producers side and then passed onto the customer, oil, the bulk of the tax is usually at the petrol pump and in corporation tax.
Scots Nats may think oil is worth trillions and nasty ....

8516 2018-11-26 12:23:17 Start using palm oil from a sustainable source. Help the wildlife.
8517 2018-11-26 12:23:11 So, where has my babbling led?

We have different paradigms:
You view oil as necessary, I view it as temporary.
You view oil as a profit center, I view it as a cost center.
You view AB as a central player, I view it as a has-been vs USA shale.
You see , I see

8520 2018-11-26 12:23:01 Well, any CEO prepared to stick their neck above the parapet and nail their colours to the mast is fine by me. Iceland have already committed to using no palm oil by 2020...this is fabulous. I respect him.

8529 2018-11-26 12:22:18 We love Sindh and all Sindhis. There is no point in think bad about them. Karachi is our life line. We get gas from Sindh. Whatever little oil we have comes from Sindh. Fertilisers what not and what not. We are proud of Sindh
8530 2018-11-26 12:22:09 Just in my thought, palm oil production has no value if we harm our environment and wildlife. Hence it is necessary to keep the wild life and rainforest in safe rate otherwise we will not see the green on earth but only palmoil products everywhere, keep it under control please!!!

8618 2018-11-26 12:12:35 This is so sad, palm oil is in everything,  we are slowly killing ourselves with the deforestation and the animals 
8619 2018-11-26 12:12:19 And the production of one gallon of ethanol from corn requires 20 gallons of water. If you look at the impending water crisis in the Southwest US, this should concern everyone. Ethanol is not a net “oil saver”.
8620 2018-11-26 12:12:10 Contracts in oil biz tend to be long term...rights would not pass to Scot Gov until current contract was complete (ie field was exhausted). or perhaps if massive compensation was paid (to offset exploration & development costs & lost profits) so rights could be reclaimed early.

8628 2018-11-26 12:11:30 I'm not sure exactly what the harm is in pushing for cleaner energy. It's really a win-win scenario. Whether you accept the science or not it would help create new jobs and innovations. It would also provide competition to big oil companies.

8762 2018-11-26 11:56:35 It's more like a Trump first response. His business with the Saudis is significant. The US does not have a solid agreement for arms and Trump does NOT influence oil prices.

Sunflower oil, Vitamin E
Same essential oils    
Bottle and dropper for better storage and easier application
8770 2018-11-26 11:55:36 So to some up:
You consider oil a "valuable resource", I consider it an "outside expense" (aka waste of money ).

Now about Alberta.  While AB loves to crow about its oil, I also remember Hibernia. And Oil Springs.  I'm sitting on Utica right now.
So what role for AB?

8882 2018-11-26 11:43:32 Alaska has an dividend from oil. UK's land worth £260bn pa rental value. With no other changes to tax/benefits, paid out as a UBI,  gives every man, woman and child £4K a year. Which is only fair you think about it.

Solves housing crisis instantly too. What's not to like?
8883 2018-11-26 11:43:22 Well I think it's a disgraceful deal and I hope it fails Parliament.  Who really wants to throw away our Soverignty

8887 2018-11-26 11:42:53 Israel secretly supported Iran...crazy times. So everything is great in the region for Iran now? No problems with the USA, Syria or even Israel these days since Hussein was removed? Or your economy, oil exports or your nuclear weapon program?
8888 2018-11-26 11:42:50 PM Modi's India looks after the water supply of Pakistan and the safe oil supply of China. Such a thoughtful, considerate neighbour.

8893 2018-11-26 11:42:34 This is the biggest crock of unworkable gibberish I've ever seen. It's just another scheme for the elites & their non producer minions to enslave the producers under the abject guise of Socialism. Take your snake oil somewhere else.

8898 2018-11-26 11:42:02 Oil economy dependency has killed jobs in two provinces now because of slow admission that fossil fuels are never going to have any future.
8899 2018-11-26 11:42:01 It's a poor excuse for a REAL tax cut,  and our own oil producers are suffering because you are kissing the Saudis butt. If our producers suffer,  jobs will be lost.

8912 2018-11-26 11:40:53 So basically half the world can come to USA? Latin America, the Middle East and  any country with oil. Is the USA willing to take the 10 million haitians that are suffering and suffocating Dominican Republic's economy and territory? Should all UK ex-colonies go there too?

8926 2018-11-26 11:39:37 We do not purchase or use palm oil in any of its products. However, trace amounts of palm derivatives (by-products from refining palm oil) are used to stabilise the active ingredients in a select number of our products. 1/4

8984 2018-11-26 11:31:05 There is international funding, but not enough to make an impact unfortunately. Where national parks are being encroached by loggers and palm oil production, that points to serious governance, law and order, and even corruption issues.

9002 2018-11-26 11:29:14 She’ll get a job with the oil-companies...doesn’t have to drill for oil again... a woman sucking like that......or maybe u hired her already Priest..?
9003 2018-11-26 11:29:10 That's the blunt truth.
Commodity for legacy systems? That's a dog, not a cash cow.
Oil may have been a  ten years ago, now it's a dog.  The industry will be a bloodbath.
All the pipelines in the world won't change that.
Plus, Asia has been buoying demand, likely to end soon.
9004 2018-11-26 11:29:03 Haha, yeah fair enough. And yeah - I sit next to someone at work who had to call the exterminator last weekend because of a rat. Apparently peppermint works well as a deterrent. Soak some cotton balls in peppermint oil. Leave them near the entry/exit points. They hate it.

9009 2018-11-26 11:28:09 And, by the way, pipelines increase neither the supply nor the demand for oil, and provide a environmentally friendlier way to transport it. Way better than trains or trucks.
9010 2018-11-26 11:28:08 Government overtaxed businesses and oversubsidized oil which caused a horrid meltdown once oil prices collapsed. Money then needed to be printed in order to prevent a contraction of the money supply (which is mostly futile since that just destroys buying power but whatever)
9011 2018-11-26 11:27:58 Alberta’s economy is tanking? That’s news to me! Last I’ve read is that Alberta’s economy has diversified & continues to improve since 2015. Oil industry’s failures are beyond a company folding to move to a different country for cheaper labour. You’re comparing 2 different things

With high oil prices, profits come from crude trade.

With low oil prices, profits come from refineries business.

Refineries business requires money to invest in targeted markets.

-oil is a commodity

Hard-nosed analysis: don't invest in commodity production during a global glut with increasing supply. You can't win this.

9153 2018-11-26 11:11:52 So, you are going to take total credit for the oil prices.  My God man, what an ego you have, you’ll twist everything into something that, in your eye, makers you look Almighty.  BTW, those tax cuts?? Strongly favor the rich like the Trumps.

I wish I had this one 2 years ago when I was still teaching. I had a student bring up that conspiracy and I tried to point out the oil companies are the ones with the $. I just didn’t say it as well or w/the inside view.

9182 2018-11-26 11:06:19 I think you're right. Reducing use of palm oil or substitutes makes environmental sense, but is that possible in all products? Raising awareness of palm oil as an ingredient in many products (some of them quite surprising) is another good thing about @IcelandFoods campaign.
9183 2018-11-26 11:06:19 We send our military to fight for YEARS against the Taliban in the Middle East, who’ve caused waves of refugees, but we just shoot people at our border - fleeing their own domestic terrorism.  What’s the difference - oil prices? Weapons sales?

9220 2018-11-26 11:00:39 So whereas your paradigm is "we need oil", my paradigm is "oil is an outside expense, and anything we can do with hydro is internal operations".
So our fundamental concepts of what "we" have is totally different.  I view electricity & water as free, you view O&G as free.

9270 2018-11-26 10:53:57 They would, given the cost to drill one well and bring it online.  Which is why back in 2014-15, OPEC, at the behest of the Saudis, increased production to drive down the price per barrel below the break even point of $60. Solely to break the US oil industry.

9286 2018-11-26 10:50:40 There’s a commissioned oil painting of that scene on my wall that was my grandma’s because she loved the place, haven’t been there for a long time since I lived in Devon but I must put it on my “to do” list for next summer.

9303 2018-11-26 10:48:35 What's your stance on palm oil? Boycott or choose sustainably sourced? My worry is all these brands now boycotting will move to something equally problematic and unsustainable. Surely it's the scale of production that's the biggest problem?
9304 2018-11-26 10:48:23 Thinking this market should be traded based on reactions to oil prices now.   @realDonaldTrump Choosing ME allies based on US Interests, smart, tough decisions.. but back to status quo? hope not, reward a few for silencing the meek.

9315 2018-11-26 10:46:29 Defying Trump? I don't think so. Trump needs Lindsey to create leverage. Trump will try to be the good cop. The deal would be; lower oil prices in exchange for no sanctions.
9316 2018-11-26 10:46:21 Trump says his good relationship with Saudi Arabia is why oil prices are low. 

Gas prices are 35% HIGHER than when Obama left office.

Selling America’s soul for low gas prices is a travesty.
Selling America’s soul for Trump’s wallet is an impeachable offense.

9353 2018-11-26 10:42:05 Depends apa u pakai. If contoh u just pakai sunblock/light makeup - micellar water/milk cleanser will do just fine.

If u are wearing heavier makeup, full glam/waterproof sunblock - might want to consider oil cleanser. Tapi, tak semua skin sesuai oil cleanser kne find yg suitable
9354 2018-11-26 10:41:44 Hi! Tak perlu if it's enough 4 u. Takut nanti you dry kan your skin/rosakkan skin barrier.

For me, First cleanser - Micellar Water/Milk Cleanser/Oil Cleanser. Type cleanser kat sini depends you pakai apa lah. 

Second Cleanser - baru I guna my foaming wash or any facial wash.

9596 2018-11-26 10:10:05 There is one area that oil has benefited and that is Shetland because of the Council's deft negotiations with the oil companies. It only highlights how it has been squandered for the rest of the UK.

9742 2018-11-26 09:48:23 Snuggy is wrong. Huge amount of services are publicly owned including a lot of banks. Its oil is publicly owned. Even 'Economist' asks why we didn't keep our oil in public ownership.

9826 2018-11-26 09:37:40 Theres always a selfish undertone to the Scotland-oil debate. "We found oil, so everyone south of the boarder now don't matter", rather than discussing how all UK resources should have been better managed to benefit the UK.
9827 2018-11-26 09:37:35 A real CB1 inverse agonist, Rimonabant, was briefly marketed for weight loss but it turns out suicidal ideation's a hell of a side effect of messing with deeply-entrenched reward systems; probably just as well these are homeopathic snake oil.

9854 2018-11-26 09:33:40 We’ll be able to find more oil for many more years. The key thing to watch is how much oil it takes to get the new oil.

9873 2018-11-26 09:30:22 They haven't even *begun* their downward slide yet. Just wait until the nether region between March & June when things start warming up again, fuel oil isn't needed for heating for a while & summer transport demands haven't peaked.

9876 2018-11-26 09:30:08 Oil prices falling because the Fed is draining liquidity from the market to pay back the $4.5 TRILLION QE debt they created 2009-2014. Assets (oil, stocks, treasuries) must be liquidated to offset Fed drain. If this continues, we'll enter a bear and all the idiots will blame you.

9888 2018-11-26 09:28:54 Well do you think allowing westminster to take 92% of our oil revenues is a fair deal for scotland?
The UK is a club run by westminster for the benefit of England.
Scots lose 92% of our huge wealth to call our selves British and to be ignored and sidlined,
Is this fair to scot`s?

４→いつものシャンプーへ

意外と簡単＆香り気にならず、週一回程度でもOK

9903 2018-11-26 09:26:34 The higher tax rate is ridiculous.. our Govt. is receiving donations from the large oil companies. There is now Renault  Zoe  for $52,000.. Hyundai Kona EV & next year Nissan leaf.  They are coming no matter what the Govt does to try and stop it !
9904 2018-11-26 09:26:30 So this is a giant conspiracy involving most of the world’s governments, independent research agencies and climate scientists to move wealth from oil companies somewhere else? That seems so unbelievably complicated for no reason without any facts to back it up.
9905 2018-11-26 09:26:30 Just thinking on changing my micellar water into cleansing oil again. Just because... I dont feel really clean while using micellar water. Apaqa karena nggak pake bioderma? /EHGIMANA
9906 2018-11-26 09:26:26 It’s the same function, but i dont know, i feel like using cleansing oil lagi dapat hilangkan whitehead and bersih secara mendalam. Compared to milk. But still both great for dry skin!
9907 2018-11-26 09:26:24 Ah amazing - have been looking for a vegan spread with no palm oil for SO long!!!!
9908 2018-11-26 09:25:49 Oil should break 50 but not a 20 price! Low 40s but lots a oil out there. If your correct sir back up the oil trucks at 28.00 buy . Now what up with gold & silver ?

B10 biodiesel programme will raise minimum bio-content that local producers must put in biodiesel to be used in transport to 10% from 7%, potentially boosting demand for palm oil.
9919 2018-11-26 09:24:14 Gladly, they used that oil to build an energy network where 80% of it comes from renewables. But again another country's meddling has had a deep impact. Maybe if countries were allowed to be independent without outside "input" and dodgy get rich politicians

9932 2018-11-26 09:22:29 So they say trump paid $450bilion to another country to save the princes life, lets be honest. Who really has probable cause to be in a land rich in oil? Who wanted to start a war to take land that was rich in oil? Who would of paid and set up 911 if not the oil corporations?

9934 2018-11-26 09:22:08 Now let's see what the "politicians" gonna come up with on this oil issue in a very near future.
9935 2018-11-26 09:22:07 Yung nagrereklamo sa relasyon at joint deals between PH-CH at ayaw sa joint oil exploration, eh kayo nalang kaya ang magdrill dun? tingnan natin kung meron kayong resources at bayag.  PH-China

9942 2018-11-26 09:20:56 Point to the fact that oil which should've benefited Scotland but has so far been wasted by UK gov, it's hilarious that it suddenly becomes "The UK's oil!". Strange, for the past few years they were screeching that it's "Scotland's oil that is crashing in price"

9943 2018-11-26 09:20:44 I work in the oilfield with many Nigerians. They’ve been getting their fair share off the development of that oil for all these years. And yet, 2 tribes have basically warred and caused problems there the whole time. One Muslim and one Christian
9944 2018-11-26 09:20:44 My fav DiY LIP scrub 

- 2 tsp sugar
- 1 tsp honey
- 1 tsp olive oil
- 1 tsp gylcerine
Mix all the ingredients above and gently massage your lips for 3-4 mins. Rinse with water & apply a lip balm. 
9945 2018-11-26 09:20:26 Hi Luke. We don't use it as a single ingredient, but it's in a few of the pre-made ingredients we buy. We ask suppliers to ensure it's from a sustainable source - generally certified by the Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil, which works with the WWF on responsible farming.
9946 2018-11-26 09:20:22 We had one pipeline back in 90's and 00's didn't affect the oil getting too market. A smart company would buy all the oil futures it could get now and still make a good deal of money turning it too other products on the future since no matter what  people will still need them
9947 2018-11-26 09:20:00 I died at the motor oil part xD
9948 2018-11-26 09:19:56 Bill, I have never trusted UK Gov to treat us fairly & have written extensively on it. But it's up to us to have the guts to leave both EU and UK. New oil discoveries - with more to come - will knock subsidy argument on the head

9954 2018-11-26 09:19:20 Indian capital markets have been infused with Rs 63.10 billion. This leeway to India is mostly due to: 

1. Appreciating Rupee
2. Fall in oil prices

- Avoid putting lipstick daily.
9958 2018-11-26 09:18:59 Monday morning folks! European markets on the rise due to positivity over Italian budget and the Populist's willingness to cooperate. Brexit's deal also taken well while crude oil is on a minor recovery.

9962 2018-11-26 09:18:25 It has been so since 1976 when @MBuhari was minister of petroleum. Same reason Petroleum equalisation fund was created. It is one of the reasons for subsidy& d  aversion of cabals to deregulation of the downstream oil sector. It is the soul of racketeering
9963 2018-11-26 09:18:15 I hope they don’t stop making the Olive Oil.

9969 2018-11-26 09:17:58 Without the oil, Niger-Delta would not be this desolate and Northern Nigeria would not be the poverty capital of the world.

If you do a bit of Nigerian history, you will know this.

9971 2018-11-26 09:17:53 My parents lived / worked in the oil field there for years. Politicians get the money and the people get anything. And Nigeria is the most blessed country over there. And it still can’t make it bc they have wars of their own. Between their own skin color since my parents left.

9982 2018-11-26 09:16:29 Sorry, still not buying it! (literally). It's great you're supporting the case for palm oil but how about supporting local farmers and suppliers? I don't want meat that has travelled 5,000 miles.
9983 2018-11-26 09:16:22 Oil rebound this money, market over reacted was great time to buy an order in last night.

9986 2018-11-26 09:15:48 What was public opinion on independance before oil was found? I agree oil funds have been mis-used, but its not just Scotland that has grievences, NE, NW, Wales all have issues. You cant be part of a union, then jump ship the moment you find a resource on your doorstep.

9988 2018-11-26 09:15:34 given that the oil on Verstappen's visor meant he couldn't see, I'm not surprised Gasly was told to stop. Plus engine failing, he wasn't gonna score... What happened to the Black flag with orange circle? We seem to have lost the traditional signals nowadays.
