0 2019-03-23 23:58:23 So thrilled I found someone who stocks plus sized shorts for the studio. I wasn’t getting nothing until I could guarantee I was going to have plus sizes.
1 2019-03-23 23:57:48 strongly disagree with your position on guns. We dont need a gun culture in Australia and turn it into America, with exception of hunting rifles. But civilians do not need bump stocks, rapid fire, and semi automatics. NZ shooting is a tragic example.
2 2019-03-23 23:57:28 Er I had no idea who this heinous woman was who was being vitriolic all over Twitter now it makes sense she controls the sad sack of Michael gove! Sacking would be too good..... the stocks on the other hand

6 2019-03-23 23:53:03 I hate watching @ThePriscilla play. Every set goes to game 3, her opponent's stocks last until 150+%, and the best option she has when getting pressured is to nair, which stales so goddamn intensely. 

... That being said, SHE MADE IT TO TOP 48 LOSERS SIDE! LET'S GOOOOO
7 2019-03-23 23:51:51 @BitLifeApp i love your game. I plan on getting the VIP. I would love to see more ways to become rich (stocks?)... whah about also a “business” option where you can start a business.
8 2019-03-23 23:50:59 You post alot of dumb things. This is way up there. Instead of training people to defend themselves, you want to ban almost all firearms. There is a disqualification for domestic violence when buying. Bump stocks are banned. Mags don't kill people. People do. Maybe read up first.
9 2019-03-23 23:50:47 Just go over the financial stocks should be eye opening
10 2019-03-23 23:49:54 I don’t get sued over my real estate holdings. I run a clean business. I wouldn’t even own cigarette stocks. I have values. I can’t vote for a man who put his name on a fake university that took good, if stupid, peoples money and provide nothing in return. trump is scum.
11 2019-03-23 23:49:33 Beauty Ken!
12 2019-03-23 23:49:06 A better business environment, wages, manufacturing, stocks up. No new wars, more respect for local police, immigration enforcement, criminal justice reform and a finally a politician standing up against identity politics and PC culture gone wild. Pretty solid record.
13 2019-03-23 23:48:03 Wow nice looking dispensary!!
14 2019-03-23 23:47:03 Great looking building
15 2019-03-23 23:45:48 I have some stocks to sell Kyle.   Dorit did the wrong thing. Pk admitted that.  It should end there. Teddi is delusional
16 2019-03-23 23:43:33 stocks rise by 1%.
17 2019-03-23 23:42:23 Browns are experts at being laughing stocks and a dumpster fire organization so I’m sure you know what you’re credible.

19 2019-03-24 23:59:59 Hey @quantfury , Great app but remains two important questions:
Where can I find the exhaustive list of stocks  available?
When will limit & stop entry order types  be available?
20 2019-03-24 23:58:49 you're assuming 1.5 yeras buffer zone ... That's not how an investor thinks
if it's overvalued or overdue it is no matter if the stocks would rally 1 more year
if it's bonkers banana it is
throw it overboard and invest in undervalued long term positive outlook such as gold silver
21 2019-03-24 23:58:06 Gotta learn how to play when my rewards are low. Im trying to end stocks in less than 3 plays and there's some characters I cant do that to lol
22 2019-03-24 23:57:18 Banning semi automatic weapons or bump stocks is useless though because you can easily modify guns into higher capacity
23 2019-03-24 23:56:14 Trump already banned bump stocks. It takes effect Tuesday.
24 2019-03-24 23:56:13 Look at the net worth of the politicians. 1-600 million in net worth but if you do the math with there stocks and salaries it doesn’t add up. If my bank account was that large when I only make 75k a year. FBI would kick my door in.
25 2019-03-24 23:55:15 Why is this good for pot stocks
26 2019-03-24 23:53:40 I am in the same boat, waiting for my longs to pay off, some are airline stocks like AAL and AVH. Slim pickings for re-entry.
27 2019-03-24 23:53:39 There’s also:
Stocks
Real estate 
Starting a business 
Selling art
Starting YouTube channel 
Selling hot dogs 
Advertising for other smaller business

Research: google other ways to make money besides working 9-5


It’s worth a google
28 2019-03-24 23:53:37 Am allocating just 20% to $TMF to capture further drop in long yields, 80% will remain in growth stocks.
29 2019-03-24 23:53:30 No, it's true. No one outside of Orlando will remember this game in three days.
30 2019-03-24 23:53:27 Nah I've never felt that way playing against you I may get on edge or a little tilted when my stocks or melting away from rest or puff not dying at high percentage, but it's never anger or boredom I can say over the years of us meeting in bracket I've had fun wanted to learn more
31 2019-03-24 23:50:59 Why do I have to wait nearly a week for my sold stocks to 'settle'.

#Bitcoin settles in ~10 mins

Move over traditional finance system, you're done!
32 2019-03-24 23:49:36 I wonder if this includes the Italian and Spanish bridal wear she currently stocks in her shop, Proposals of Chichester...
33 2019-03-24 23:49:19 Trump news on Mueller case was released. BIG Deal!! Old news or new news...I never care. I focus on individual stocks and let their individual supply and demand guide me. Turn off the radio, podcasts, t.v. , and stocktwits nonsense. Focus on what matters. #stocks #mindset #news
34 2019-03-24 23:48:11 Stocks in #Asia set to decline amid concerns over global economy - CNBC.
35 2019-03-24 23:43:53 I feel like Apex should have different melee animations for when holding different guns. And stocks should increase melee dmg slightly. Being hit with a purple stock should hurt more than being punched.
36 2019-03-24 23:41:29 Can you also predict stocks too? You were 100% correct with this.
37 2019-03-24 23:40:35 Things I trust more than @marchmadness officiating. 
1. A Taco Bell fart. 
2. Venezuelan stocks. 
3. Gas station sushi
4. Butch Jones calling plays on the 1 yard line. 
5. A Drew Richmond block.
38 2019-03-22 23:59:21 Stocks Slump on Slowing Growth Concerns The U.S. equity markets closed out the week with solid losses, as global growth concerns, and  trade worries pressured sentiment. Manufacturing and service data missed expectations.
39 2019-03-22 23:57:28 Ah, maybe? It's since risen to about £25 so I'm not sure, but it could be? I think I need to research more about stocks before I do anything with it properly. 
40 2019-03-22 23:55:45  Have a look these #stocks that reached record highs: $ZS, $INFY, $CDNS, $TTD
41 2019-03-22 23:54:19 Oh, I mean in terms of stocks. Don't anticipate fleeing the country. :)

They're refusing to raise interest rates even though they need to have some room to cut them later, when the crash hits. They want another tax cut for yet another sugar high, when taxes should be going up.
42 2019-03-22 23:53:50 Like in the old days public humiliation 
Put the person in STOCKS in public square.
43 2019-03-22 23:52:53 Breaking News:
Stocks in facial tissue have  increased 86% since it's been reported that the Special Counsel's report is now done.
44 2019-03-22 23:50:42 Hi Mark - I have read more than 50 market knowledge books, and so far your books have the clearest thinking and ease of readability that any retail or pro investor could ask for. I still think that I would love to read about your approach to shorting stocks!
45 2019-03-22 23:47:11 2/3rds of the UKs entire food and drink export revenue. Largest bio science hub in the EU. 20% of the EUs fishing stocks. Scotland’s research and development spend in the higher education sector, as a percentage of GDP, is the 5th highest in the developed world.....
46 2019-03-22 23:46:58 Miss, I really respect you and love a lot of the things that you are doing, I live in PR myself. But
1. Bump stocks are only for comfort.
2. We already have Background checks, we can maybe do a more efficient one you mean?
3. SemiAutos=basically everything NOT MILITARY.

47 2019-03-22 23:43:20 Economy/stocks: Interest rates just inverted. Economists say this means recession in 18-24 months. The model says it won't take that long. Back peddling on stock outlook. US economists unlikely appreciative of global erosion. #Economy

50 2019-03-22 23:41:03 gonna buy some makeup supply for the con next weekend  all my stocks been running out this is more than needed lol
51 2019-03-22 23:40:59 It  flat out says ban bump stocks and semi-autos. If they ban semi-automatic that's taking away our guns.
52 2019-03-22 23:39:43 @MoneyWhisperer_ great article. Those using LISA with sole intention of saving for retirement should use Stocks & Shares version to achieve real return above inflation. Higher and Additional rate tax payers still better off with pension contributions and earlier access.
53 2019-03-22 23:39:17 Snow shovel stocks plummeted...they've since recovered
54 2019-03-22 23:38:51 Some of the 1st insurance policies? Slaves. The 1st stocks and bonds traded on the stock market? Slaves. The #1 tobacco, cotton, and indigo producers in the world? Slaves. DC? Benjamin banneker, slave. White house? Slaves. Washington monument? I could go down the laundry list.
