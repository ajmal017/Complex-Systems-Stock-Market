3 2018-05-31 23:58:16 None of the regulations that they're doing away with has made anyone's take-home pay go up, and very few stocks have risen significantly in direct correlation to specific regulatory actions that affect those companies. So unless you have some hard data, that's just hopey changey.

5 2018-05-31 23:57:34 People realize that Fung wouldn't have signed this legislation, right? He would have kept guns in the hands of domestic abusers and bump stocks would remain legal. There's a big difference between the candidates and I choose @GovRaimondo any day.

39 2018-05-31 23:49:22 You can think of stop losses as a way for the market to show you which stocks are the strong ones. 

For example, if you have two stocks, both with a stop loss of, say, 8% and one get stopped out, you know which one is the better one to invest in.

59 2018-05-31 23:36:21 Talk of wage-growth tanks stocks, because investors want dividend growth. They make money with money, and look at the laborers they encounter as lesser beings. "Poverty is a moral failing" seems to be their underlying premise.

66 2018-05-31 23:30:50 ohh that reminds me of an newspaper cartoon in recession back in the 1960s-70s .  Guy on street corner with a Will Work for Food sign being passed by Wall St type who says -- "you should get into stocks"
67 2018-05-31 23:30:12 I think I wanna learn stocks and start investing as soon as possible but I don’t really know how to start
68 2018-05-31 23:29:57 He was actually only shooting out of the window for 10 minutes. That’s pretty much one person shot dead every 10 seconds. From the 32nd floor. The fact that bump stocks are “fun” is an absolutely shameful excuse as to why they shouldn’t be banned

71 2018-05-31 23:27:28 A good day to be a Connecticut Yankee: The ban on bump stocks is passed into law. This won't hurt responsible gun owners and may do us all some good.
72 2018-05-31 23:26:22 That's false. Most companies are buying back stocks as their value goes up. And a bonus of $500 or so adds up to $40 a month. That's $10 a week. Big whoop.

81 2018-05-31 23:20:43 If you’re an everyday American it’s only helping if you own stocks.  And only marginally.
82 2018-05-31 23:20:21 No. Many states are independently banning bump stocks. Just today, include Connecticut to the list. Modifiers encompass any device attaching to a semi-automatic rendering it automatic. Kits currently sold with no serial number, so no tracking/registration applied.
83 2018-05-31 23:20:05 @SouthwestAir had some issues in the last few days, I wonder how that will affect their stock price. #Stocks
84 2018-05-31 23:18:08 There’s signs at my work asking for blood donors and that the Red Cross has low blood stocks, while having a male and female (could be interpreted at hetero) couple in the poster. I, and hundreds of colleagues, just have to ignore them because we’re not good enough to donate.
85 2018-05-31 23:16:49 Exactly! They count on fear to scare investors away to further help their cause to drive #stock prices down.

87 2018-05-31 23:13:53 I like to treat the rest of the world as my beta testers. What I lose on not investing in stocks and shares, I gain in low-cost tech with bugs ironed out and only watching the good stuff. Thanks, guys! *pats early adaptors on the head* Taking one for the team, again!
88 2018-05-31 23:13:53 Banning bump stocks doesn't make sense...   Why are you a hypocrite...  Is it accidental?  Do you need guidance?  Just say so. I'll show you the statistics...
89 2018-05-31 23:13:16 None that I can see cause right now it’s investing in stocks. No IRA action
90 2018-05-31 23:13:01 The only difference we had in this phony recovery is that gold miners for the 1st time since WW2, didn't follow the business/credit cycle. The only way to lose 70-90% of your money after the biggest money printing binge ever, was gold stocks.
91 2018-05-31 23:12:44 Shorts like to spoof
92 2018-05-31 23:12:41 To be accurate, stocks didn't crash. They dipped. They probably will crash, but today wasn't it.

96 2018-05-31 23:09:00 There is a type of inflation that isn't easy for the govt to lie about. We just haven't had that kind yet. But we have had long euphoric rallies in stocks, bonds and the USD. Unprecedented reflation of the housing bubble, record low volatility and flat gold prices.
97 2018-05-31 23:08:29 Champaign , caviar, stocks, bonds? With these left wingers who knows?
98 2018-05-31 23:07:58 They're just giving gifts on the ask these last few days. The most beautiful part about it though, is that every single trade happens on the ask. Not a single dumper since the 24th and there was only 1, and it was at the same pps at the time.  Very respectful traders on this one
99 2018-05-31 23:07:43 Je reste chez moi (j'habite dans une ferme à la campagne donc source de bouffe assez importante) tout en faisant le plus de stocks possible en pillant des magasins (que se soit armes, bouffe ou vêtements)
100 2018-05-31 23:07:42 Are you familiar with bump stocks? 

If I attach a tank missle launcher on my car, my car is essentially a tank in a City Center. 

And no I’m not that stupid, things are easily googable, i don’t know everything about guns, I do know they kill a ton of people tho.
101 2018-05-31 23:07:06 @Emma4Change can i use bump stocks for a squirt (water) gun?
102 2018-05-31 23:06:47 I like shooting guns. I own guns. I'm willing to sacrifice a bit because they have plenty out there that honestly doesn't make sense when it comes to gun rights. I said years ago as someone who shoots guns how the hell was bump stocks not banned long ago?
103 2018-05-31 23:06:08 I got stocks & 401ks & shit invested. I can’t just fuck my coworker, blow the spot up & jump in something new next week.
104 2018-05-31 23:05:17 Now we're entering a trade war... good job.  Europe going to WTO tomorrow.  Sad!  While you're add it, why don't you ban bump stocks and raise the age to 21 to purchase fire arms?  Yeah, you're owned by the NRA.

115 2018-05-31 23:01:17 Also i'm noticing: Graphite stocks bounced off lows earlier in the year and then went silent with a pull back, however a lot of bullish news flow are coming from thee stocks. If EV growth is going to get real, then you bet Graphite stocks with jumbo flake will do major runs soon

117 2018-05-31 22:59:07 Too much at stake for them. You know, stocks, money, agenda, corporations etc. Once they owe someone who helped get them where they are the will of the citizens falls upon deaf ears stuffed with cash.
118 2018-05-31 22:54:31 Take the video, add stocks are at peaks, add high consumer and corporate debt, add rising interest rates, add the repeal of financial protection regulations, and add repeat of financial shenanigans leading to 2008 crisis, concern warranted that major downturn is near.
119 2018-05-31 22:53:54 I'll try to address these one by one. Stock market has steadily increased under Obama and Trump. Unfortunately, upticks in the market don't help the poor or middle class. Only the well to do who own stocks.
120 2018-05-31 22:53:30 In fairness, I believe Sessions is in the process of banning bump stocks. They have to go through a three month comment period before they can expand the machine gun ban to include them though.
However, they absolutely should raise the federal age to 21 ASAP.

123 2018-05-31 22:51:24 Bump Stocks Don't kill crazy people do, fix the crazy people or your problem will continue even if bump stocks are banned via another means its the intent of the person you have to stop
124 2018-05-31 22:50:51 I keep thinking I wish I knew ahead of time, every time he threatens a tariff, and then changes his mind.  I'd make a killing in stocks.
125 2018-05-31 22:50:33 Yes of course. But I meant financial assets (stocks, bonds) from eu deficit countries. That is risky and has counterparty risk, but will earn an income and will fully erase T2 imbalances. Look at SwissNB, they have 700bn of foreign assets on b/s, cparty risk and also forex risk
126 2018-05-31 22:50:33 You asked. Didn’t wait for an answer and ranted at me for not answering. I want universal background checks. Private sales and internet. I want waiting periods. Red flag laws.

131 2018-05-31 22:47:16 "U.S. financial market were little moved by the data. The USD fell against the euro.... Prices for U.S. Treasuries rose.

"Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower after the Trump admin. decided to impose...import tariffs...sparking new concerns of a trade war w our main allies."

133 2018-05-31 22:45:58 That is, a full year from the go date of recreational legislation - will be interesting to see then how many people understand inventory turns, out of stocks, short ships, EDI & the laundry list of fines and chargebacks that provincial sales bodies will hit LPS with
134 2018-05-31 22:45:42 Market doesn’t seem concerned about your “levels” too much-bottom line in my opinion is the strength of the FANG stocks this week was truly amazing, cant be ignored. I’d be shocked if they don’t BO very soon...
135 2018-05-31 22:44:07 #Bitcoin & #Cryptocurrency volitality has been subsiding, but #stocks are getting the opposite effect. Could the #crypto exchanges be listening and better monitoring for price manipulation. Get ready for a stable crypto market.

138 2018-05-31 22:42:37 Let’s see. He lowered taxes putting more money in my pocket. He is Defeating ISIS. Going to have a meeting with North Korea. He vetoed all of Obummer crap. Stock market through the roof. Banned bump stocks. Should I continue?  All Obama did was scandals and raised our debt.
139 2018-05-31 22:42:34 Why the delay? Did you decide you needed to get your stock broker to move all of your stocks into other things before you put these tariffs in place?
140 2018-05-31 22:42:24 No significant pay raises, job growth on same slow upward trend as under 44, same for stocks, trade war effects not fully seen yet, insurance premiums rising, gas prices rising, crops rotting in fields, small farmer insecurity, so I guess we are looking at different numbers.

154 2018-05-31 22:33:56 Will June be a flat month for stocks? @StovallCFRA says S&P 500 in June has been been higher 53 percent of the time but it has averaged a near perfectly flat return of just 0.02 percent since 1945
.
155 2018-05-31 22:33:20 The assumption is that at any given time the market has priced in all news (efficient market hypothesis). Market anomaly contradicts this. I think low float momentum stocks are quite harder to price since a lot of dumb money flows into these.

162 2018-05-31 22:27:30 His move on trade tariffs will 
 tank his OWN stocks as well. There is no equivalent to steel on the market.

The move is likely an attempt to force the U.S. to buy chinese steel in larger quantity. Except they are the ones we have tariff/trade problems with.

177 2018-05-31 22:17:32 Sudden volatility across asset classes triggered a huge one-day drop in risk appetite among investors. That was large enough to move it into extreme territory. Big drops to this kind of extreme, have led to good medium-term returns in stocks.

217 2018-05-31 21:58:57 From the stocks I follow it hasn't been been a streak for more than a week. The monthly track still shows an upward TREND and the year shows big gains. From inageration day most stocks are up by as hish as 20%. That is a trend not a fluctuation which you elude to
218 2018-05-31 21:57:36 Will be glad to see the end of $URA rebalancing. Tho they generally seem to be trying their best not to depress #uranium stocks too much by their selling. Today they saw about 400K shares on the bid for $FCU so sold into those bids in last few minutes so $FCU closed unchanged.
219 2018-05-31 21:57:35 This a.m. the US decided to put tariffs on steel and aluminum with our major trade partners and allies. I wonder who among #45's friends traded in their stocks in these companies yesterday knowing this was coming? #InsiderInformation @SRuhle

227 2018-05-31 21:54:54 I'm not quite at the canned goods and ammo point BUT I don't recommend putting money you plan to use in the next 10 years in S&P stocks. And if you have some I'd move it.
228 2018-05-31 21:54:22 Killing the economy. Stocks going down. You are destroying America.
229 2018-05-31 21:54:02 The 2nd part is intuitively hard to grasp I believe because momentum investing is sometimes visualized by for example an AMZN or ADBE stock graph. Is it correct to say that these kind of stocks are the minority of momentum factor returns?
230 2018-05-31 21:53:52 TD, please bring back FRIP taken from Scottrade clients.

235 2018-05-31 21:52:50 How do you financially benefit personally from this? So stocks dropped today so that your straw buyers can buy cheap & next week you say nevermind & those same stocks go up & only you profit. This should be illegal but of course you are special & our leadership fails yet again!
236 2018-05-31 21:52:24 Why haven’t you banned bump stocks? Or raise the legal age to buy a weapon to 21 like you said you would? Are you afraid of @NRA?

255 2018-05-31 21:41:22 Let's not get carried away with fake headlines.  "New lows" referred to intraday give and take.  I've got a broad spectrum of stocks and just checked, and I didn't lose money today despite the DOW being down a tad.
256 2018-05-31 21:40:29 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
257 2018-05-31 21:39:39 After Trump pushes Mexico into a recession we will all feel the pain. This is why I recently sold a bunch of stocks. #UnintendedConsequences

261 2018-05-31 21:37:22 It’s not too bad actually. I’m still learning ofcourse but it depends on the stocks and bonds offered by your corporation. I have risky and conservative in mines . You would have to find out what company your job uses so you can look into your options.
262 2018-05-31 21:36:59 Donald Trump (on phone): It’s Donald. Buy feck stocks... all of them. I don’t wanna hear excuses. *hangs up* 
Donald Trump: (to self) NOW we’ll see who’s feckless.
263 2018-05-31 21:36:40 I have a feeling @LaFromagerieUK stocks it. Obviously, I have to try it now
264 2018-05-31 21:36:31 Ban bump stocks
265 2018-05-31 21:36:18 Yesterday pity’s Cronus wud have dumped steel stocks .... They will buy back now
266 2018-05-31 21:35:47 I don't disagree with you there. It's almost as though he's calling out to his friends to say what she did was okay though. I've heard rumors of Trump's friends selling steel stocks right before the tariffs were put into place. He'll pardon them if they get caught too.
267 2018-05-31 21:35:04 You can make the age to buy a gun 50 and kill bump stocks but you are not stopping anything. It is the people that do these things we need to stop. That is the hardest thing because we all have the same rights. You just can't say THIS GUY CAN"T HAVE A GUN...….
268 2018-05-31 21:34:31 Want an example of #marketing differences in Asia vs. U.S.?  In China & Japan, red is propitious, green a problem, so markets there show rising stocks in red type, dropping stocks in green. Forget Western-style "in the red" and "eco-friendly" color messaging there.
269 2018-05-31 21:34:04 Ten bucks say that he owns US Steel or Steel Dynamics stocks.

277 2018-05-31 21:31:31 Please reread comment, I said stocks go up and down all the time bit the stock market looks good. It's growing. Wages have gone up more so in the last year then in the last administrations 8 years. So far you haven't proven any of my claims false. Just deflecting
278 2018-05-31 21:31:29 INBOX: @GovRaimondo will sign the bump stocks ban and red flag bill tomorrow morning. Both have now passed the General Assembly. #WPRO
279 2018-05-31 21:31:09 As I understand it, it doesn’t count real estate at all. It’s just the value of the stocks held by some Church-owned corporations.

289 2018-05-31 21:28:22 Exactly WHAT is this "fight" you want people to join? Fight against violence? Fight against freedom? Fight against bump-stocks? Against "assault weapons"? If these young people want something to fight for, then have them fight for SCHOOL SAFETY.
290 2018-05-31 21:27:36 @poponjer @NotJackKemp @TyWalker716 @theunticket - where can I find the full versions to all the old summer bash songs??   And all the ticket stocks ones as well?? In My Side Room......
291 2018-05-31 21:27:02 what are "alternatives"? cannabis stocks?
292 2018-05-31 21:26:40 In answer to the question, The Children are wherever YOUR policy put them. Also, so far this year, the parents of 40 children killed in school shootings had to bury them, and you can't take the minimal steps of banning bump stocks and raising the firearms purchase age to 21.
293 2018-05-31 21:25:38 There are more voters in the center, just watching this craziness.  There is Trump and the Porn Star lead media throwing out the C word.  Media stocks are at all time highs, wonder who they want as the next President. SamB winning a social change award, not without Trump as Pres.
294 2018-05-31 21:25:38 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
295 2018-05-31 21:25:20 In my opinion, the stocks are cooling to make a very aggressive move to the upside into June and then top by the end of the quarter to sell hard into July. Expecting a very volatile summer! $SPX
296 2018-05-31 21:25:16 Well said - nor do pensioners retirement funds when the company stocks' suffer because of mindless rhetoric.
297 2018-05-31 21:25:03 Wages going up was started by democrats and repubs were in a rage over it. Now they claim it was done by them haha. You are the one that claimed success of Trump by stocks going up so then now you claim it means nothing...Wow you are so desperate to not admit he has done zilch!
298 2018-05-31 21:23:55 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?

300 2018-05-31 21:23:14 PVNC.  its hardly traded any sort of real vol since rs a few years agom. Once those shares are eaten up no telling what dollar price it will to.  This guy behind it had some good connections i believe.   Some higher priced foreign stocks.  A must hold in case it can go 5 bucksimo
301 2018-05-31 21:23:12 Stocks always go up and down. But they are stronger now and more consistent then 2 years ago. Of course the unemployment is going to go down after a recession but the last two years many more were employees but not under employed Also wages have gone up a lot Nothing was untrue
302 2018-05-31 21:22:54 Football Hipsters are the worst kind of Hipsters

304 2018-05-31 21:21:28 thats the whole point. the bad publicity has bombed thier stocks so they are now trying to patch it. so this im sorry campaign is to appease the stock holders. you slouch. you numpty.

306 2018-05-31 21:20:49 Why haven't you banned bump stocks and raised the legal age to purchase guns?
307 2018-05-31 21:20:36 If stocks don’t start rising soon or have a “market accident”, US deficit estimates will have to be raised, potentially significantly & quickly.
308 2018-05-31 21:19:30 He pled guilty you fool. Do something your country needs and what you are paid for. Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
309 2018-05-31 21:18:58 Just some context to the market effect of Trump's trade war-inducing tariffs. 

From yesterday's close to today's, the Dow $DJIA dropped 251.94 points, or ≅1%.

Thus, over $70 BILLION was erased from total market value of the stocks that make up the Dow.

Winning yet?
310 2018-05-31 21:17:53 Idk why people feel so comfortable sharing all of their issues with me 

like do you ask your mail man about good health regimens?

Do you talk to your car salesman about how you want your manicure done?

Do you ask your grocery store clerk how to invest into penny stocks ??
311 2018-05-31 21:17:38 The average American has very little money in the stock market (54% of Americans own stocks). The first quarter growth was revised downward to 2.2%. The trade war that Trump has launched (which is in contradiction to the free market) will lead to lower economic growth.
312 2018-05-31 21:15:40 You mean when she actually took stocks?

317 2018-05-31 21:13:33 Good old @JustinTrudeau must have stocks in the steel companies.  He doesn't give a shit about the Oil & Gas industry.
318 2018-05-31 21:12:30 US stocks finished lower on Thursday due to renewed trade crisis after US canceld customs exemption on steel and aluminum imports from Canada, EU and Mexico

320 2018-05-31 21:11:06 He has done more than any president has in the last 18 years. Taxes are low, unemployment for minorities is at all time lows, the stocks are good wages increased for the first time in years. Things are going well. But you are right he should get more done
321 2018-05-31 21:10:43 I educated myself when it came to taxes, credit score, stocks, mutual funds, real estate etc. You got to learn this stuff on your own cause school won’t teach you
322 2018-05-31 21:09:28 Speculation in stocks is not a measure of transactions in the economy overall. You're applying your own market view to the precepts discussed - very different. The article discusses speculation re. prices that occurs w/ price inflation after monetary inflation.

332 2018-05-31 21:04:38 FYI...bump-stocks are of no use to anyone wanting to perpetrate a mass killing.
Raising the age to 21 would not prevent a lawbreaker from getting weapons.
333 2018-05-31 21:04:25 I’m not doing either. I am for sensible gun legislation. That includes a ban on semi automatic weapons like the AR-15, high cap magazines, bump stocks. Also stricter background checks, longer waiting periods. None of that infringes on a lawful citizen’s 2A rights.

382 2018-05-31 20:47:46 Aye! My stocks are going up! Once this hits 30 cents I might just sell it! Tripled my investment! 
383 2018-05-31 20:46:53 Yeah I have. Most stocks but def tech stocks scare me big time on long timeframes.
384 2018-05-31 20:46:22 Paranoid much? BTW Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
385 2018-05-31 20:46:18 Thanks for putting this clip up! Christ I hope we get this guy 
386 2018-05-31 20:46:03 i thought bump stocks were already banned federally last month.....
387 2018-05-31 20:45:51 Well, the market is very choppy but there are MANY individual stocks that play out nicely, almost daily ... SPY, DIA or whatever might be tough but individual stocks are working great. Just have to dig down and find em!
388 2018-05-31 20:45:46 Is anyone investigating if and who bought huge amounts of stocks and options in the metals in the last 4 or 5 days. Anyone connected to trump?????
389 2018-05-31 20:45:31 You said that was why you fired him! BTW Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?

391 2018-05-31 20:45:16 Thank you @realDonaldTrump Stocks  have fallen over 200 points as Pres. Trump imposes new tariffs on the  three biggest U.S. trading partners, Canada, Mexico, and the EU.
392 2018-05-31 20:44:21 The ageing Asian markets are ready for a full board reprieve. Double down on hedge funds and drip stocks . Remember the louder the bang the slower the squeeze. #bullish #timetobuy

395 2018-05-31 20:42:34 If I come across as angry. It's because I am. I'm fed up of how repeatedly this has happened and how easily it could've been avoided. I don't think assault weapons should belong in the hands of the public. High capacity magazine weapons and bump stocks should not be sold.
396 2018-05-31 20:42:32 The top five stocks that gained today were $GM, $GLW, $PVH, $TRIP, and $EXPE.

405 2018-05-31 20:35:34 What app are y’all using to trade stocks? Cause y’all keep posting it but y’all aren’t putting anybody on.
406 2018-05-31 20:35:33 All cements stocks like acc ambuja and ultratech breached monthly trendline. What's cooking?
407 2018-05-31 20:35:08 There are so many other stocks that will actually yield better profits. $snap is NOT where it's at
408 2018-05-31 20:34:25 How about Oxycontin now?  While bump stocks were not responsible for one death in CT last year over 1000 people OD'd on Oxycontin.  You could speak w/ @jahimes as he receives money from Purdue Pharma.
409 2018-05-31 20:34:03 Lol not true on any level. Job creation is down. Stocks growing slower than under Obama. You're facts are just not true
410 2018-05-31 20:34:02 Not really? Come on. What’s the value of bump stocks for you?
411 2018-05-31 20:33:54 ban bump stocks
412 2018-05-31 20:33:05 All the rich people now have so much money that the only thing they can find to spend it on are stocks.
413 2018-05-31 20:31:00 Stocks ending lower on trade war fears. Dow -236 points.
414 2018-05-31 20:30:54 EU and Canada say they will retaliate to President Trumps tariffs, which is weighing on Stocks.
415 2018-05-31 20:30:14 Here's what Trump did to machinery stocks (i.e., metal users) after making his steel + aluminum tariffs official today. That's a lot of wealth wiped out:

Manitowoc $MTW -5.8%
Terex $TEX -3.6
Deere $DE -3.6
Tesla $TSLA -2.4
Caterpillar $CAT -2.3
Harley $HOG -2.2
Cummins $CMI -2.1
416 2018-05-31 20:29:31 And I'd follow the money to see who is benefitting from fluctuations in stock prices. Who is betting against or for certain stocks? There are laws on the books about this, but I don't know that this government would investigate.
417 2018-05-31 20:28:50 #PCSTip: Avoid shipping extremely valuable items (stocks, jewelry, coins, gold bullion, documents) or identify high-value items on the inventory
418 2018-05-31 20:28:21 RussellEgan Yes, but strong earnings are a potent antidote to what could have been a much worse reset for stocks.
419 2018-05-31 20:28:21 Should have left it Daisy....i’m sure the Mistreses will bring some wax and strips and then when your in those naughty stocks they could pounce 
420 2018-05-31 20:28:01 When I argue these types of things, I argue a very broad approach, because I'm never sure what the specifics of what people want are. I support a ban on bump-stocks, although I'm not sure how far your "comment sense" gun controls go, so I can't say I immediately agree.
421 2018-05-31 20:27:54 The Church usually doesn't keep stocks for long. I've asked! :) They told me they sell securities immediately when they get them. I remember on my mission in Montreal, Quebec driving by a HUGE field with a big sign..."owned by The Church of.....".....they gotta alot of dirt!
422 2018-05-31 20:27:46 Stocks aren’t money.
The discussion is about new forms of money, monetary instruments. Not equity.
423 2018-05-31 20:27:04 OK. Bump stocks are banned in CT. Responsible and law abiding citizens in possession will either sell them or dispose of them some other way. What I'm wondering is...What effect will this regulation have on "foaming at the mouth" MANIACS? The ones who shoot school kids.
424 2018-05-31 20:26:46 Stocks red. $DB looks shitty. Spain and Italy both broke.

426 2018-05-31 20:26:17 Clearly he was an experienced shooter who trained and shot more than most. I'm sure he was proficient in magazine changes. And I beg to differ about the bump stocks. They make aiming harder. If he took his time he could have killed more without it.
427 2018-05-31 20:25:57 Country before political ideology and what it means for the markets. Jobs report tomorrow. Time for my usual sermon.

428 2018-05-31 20:24:51 @realDonaldTrump Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA ?
429 2018-05-31 20:24:41 Yes, but strong earnings are a potent antidote to what could have been a much worse reset for stocks.
430 2018-05-31 20:24:19 Why do ppl invest in stocks, they are not ideal SOVs either 
431 2018-05-31 20:23:55 the majority of people buying stocks are just daytrading (or hodling and waiting for a bigger sucker). The endless cycle of pump and dump makes for a lousy stock
Because of that, you people are actually the biggest reason these stocks will never be used to buy and sell goods..
432 2018-05-31 20:23:01 Why didn’t Trump ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when he said he would? Is Trump afraid of the NRA
433 2018-05-31 20:22:35 @Jonk87 Stephen does your gap n crap strategy apply to biotech stocks? Thanks love your videos by the way
434 2018-05-31 20:22:10 Most of the reason for the high number of casualties in Las Vegas was because the shooter had 100 round high capacity magazines. If he had only 10 round magazines, the death toll would have been significantly lower, even with bump stocks.
435 2018-05-31 20:22:05 This line has been trundled out for years as the S&P has risen & gold has gone nowhere. The most sensible advice for most is to remain invested in good stocks long term. History shows that.
436 2018-05-31 20:22:04 I always review. During the weekend i go back and look at which stocks / charts we’re moving and try to reverse engineer it

443 2018-05-31 20:20:07 People are following David because 1. Support him. Or 2. Scared about losing AR-15 and bump stocks. .  And you seem like a big pile of # 2

Result: expect AH price recovery
446 2018-05-31 20:18:25 I think you're wrong insofar you allege they think they'll get "brownie points". They're getting paid really well for the role they're playing, and their stocks are doing well as well.

449 2018-05-31 20:17:52 We would also replenish their stocks at British taxpayers expense of course.  Good for British Industry.  The new generation ones would be much more accurate.
450 2018-05-31 20:17:16 Stocks end lower as U.S. tariffs renew trade-war fears
451 2018-05-31 20:16:56 World stocks mostly lower: US -.7%; Europe -.6%. Trade war fears rattled markets as Trump administration signals hardline with tariffs now. A true trade war will have significant effects on economy & market. Perhaps bluff but who knows.

462 2018-05-31 20:13:52 My 401k and stocks are doing great. Trump told us we might get tired of winning. Also, ask the Syrians, the Libyans, ISIS, Iran, and NoKo who is the joke. Hint: He said “if you like your doctor you keep your doctor”.

474 2018-05-31 20:09:03 Agree except 15 was the tight volatility range for like 100 days (where single stocks were moving up nicely) and then suddenly the two big waves down in Q3 and Q4 essentially. 2017 peaked really far from the ma so getting back has been like sea sickness.

478 2018-05-31 20:07:53 Nice piece on ES.I hear you.Sadly selling weakness in stocks anticipating a continuation lower did me in the past couple of months.When the break lower comes "even for a correction" no one will have the heart to sell the break down.

484 2018-05-31 20:05:24 An equity risk premium makes sense if people are actively buying individual stocks. But in a world of Index funds, perhaps an equity risk discount actually makes more sense. The implication in a permanently lower interest rate world might be a future normal PE around 30.
485 2018-05-31 20:05:07 Negative day for #stocks as trade war worries send the Dow down 252 points, or 1%. But Nasdaq down just 0.3% & all 3 major indexes notch best month since January
486 2018-05-31 20:05:00 Not really... besides the alleged shooter in Vegas, bump stocks have not been an issue. I am not saying banning bump stocks is all THAT terrible, if that is where it ends; but I know it's not.
487 2018-05-31 20:04:10 Stocks just stopped going up in 1q18 & PCE expenditures & corporate profits were punkish.  not a good sign for a trade that is supposed to be "US economy weakens last & least in response to strong USD & rising rates", but things can chg...am watching closely.

490 2018-05-31 20:02:51 Er, no. Bump stocks are part of the problem. DOJ thinks it is part of the problem as well.

Completely dismissing it is irresponsible.
491 2018-05-31 20:02:48 Guys...I wanna buy stocks.  Where do I begin?
492 2018-05-31 20:02:31 the company who makes bump stocks is out of business. I posted it a few weeks ago. Nobody noticed.
493 2018-05-31 20:02:21 Show me a sports bra that will handle your 40DD CHWEST and my 30F will buy stocks in that company

495 2018-05-31 20:00:08 Lisa, it would not surprise me if Benedict Donald, and his buddies are selectively “Shorting Stocks”!
496 2018-05-31 19:59:38 Interesting. I’ll keep an eye on it. It’s why we switched stocks - a couple days in a row and I’d be uncomfortably retaining water everywhere. I’ll see if tomatoes correlate w weight bumps
497 2018-05-31 19:59:37 Are bump stocks still legal?
498 2018-05-31 19:57:43 We shouldn't have expiration dates on milk because I got sick once from the flu! Expired milk is not the problem! You see how dumb that sounds? More than one thing can be a problem. Bump stocks are ALSO a problem. Unless you don't think that 500 people shot in Vegas is a problem?
499 2018-05-31 19:57:12 So no mass shooter has ever used bump stocks?  That is a lie. Please stop picking and choosing facts.  Bump stocks are ridiculous outside of military use.  Full stop.

501 2018-05-31 19:56:39 don't care about SamB/Roseanne. B/C this is on my mind 5000 DEAD in Puerto Rico & only 49 deaths acknowledged, 23 school shootings where someone was hurt or killed this year- no gun reform such as bump stocks ban & age restrictions. Babies r tore from mother arms 2 prove a point
502 2018-05-31 19:56:13 same pattern for some weeks : some winners going higher and higher, most stocks doing nada or even going down
503 2018-05-31 19:55:51 Bump stocks are still an issue though
504 2018-05-31 19:55:49 FANG stocks are expected to outperform in the trade wars era apparently
505 2018-05-31 19:55:17 After finishing reading the whole thing I can see what they did. They aren't actually saying that bump stocks fire that way, they are just categorically defining them as machine guns. Clever wording, kind of like the #2A itself.
506 2018-05-31 19:55:01 Yes.  Pls. ban bump stocks.  Thx.
507 2018-05-31 19:54:55 Ricky I hope your family in Puerto Rico, stocks up on clean water, hardhats and any thing else they can to sustain them through the hurricane season! I feel for them all!
508 2018-05-31 19:54:33 Because bump-stocks do nothing to stop a 5.56 round from penetrating a wall of flesh?

What we need is MK Ultra 2.0, this time on the masses, so that we can skip the song and dance routine of slowly degrading the populace.
509 2018-05-31 19:53:31 You can’t say it, but you can grab it? I’m confused. 

Also nasty is not racist.

In real news:
5,000 ppl died in PR
Immigrant children taken from their families.
Bump stocks are still not banned
Tax plan is not working
PP under attack
List goes on
510 2018-05-31 19:52:44 Dumbest thing I've read all day. "Weapons of war" in modern times, generally come in fully automatic fire rates. (Not legal to the public). So, what military uses buml stocks? What good is a bump stock, on a fully automatic weapon? (Again. Illegal for civilians)
511 2018-05-31 19:52:11 All wealth beyond $100 Million per person should be placed into a US Sovereign Wealth Fund. Not taxed, simply reallocated.

517 2018-05-31 19:50:00 Well, that's a shame because I would love to hear that debate! However, I was specifically talking about bump stocks. We all want to get to the root of the problem and bump stocks are not the problem. Santa Fe shooter used a shotgun and revolver.

522 2018-05-31 19:47:19 Tariffs only serve to prop up inefficient industries, there is zero positive influence unless you're the industry being propped up.  Can stocks go up under tariffs? Of course.  But the net impact of tariffs are always negative.

535 2018-05-31 19:41:38 I see a clear and present danger for stocks right now.  I don't think it's because of a trade war.  I think it's because this administration can't seem to make up it's mind.  Off and on, off and on.  Just doesn't seem stable!

676 2018-05-31 18:39:33 Bump stocks make shooters inaccurate.  Take them away, but you should probably let the uneducated shoot with them.  As for the age limit our rights don't begin at 21.  When you are not an entitled liberal brat you leave into the world at 18 and have the right to protect yourself.

692 2018-05-31 18:32:00 President Obama didn't "legalize" bump stocks. ATF determined bump stocks were not *illegal.* Several times. ATF also said the same to Trump recently. If Congress under Obama wasn't controlled by GOP, maybe real gun reform would have happened then. It won't now. NRA owns GOP.

697 2018-05-31 18:29:28 Things to do with finances, like stocks and shares, credit cards, loans, what the things on your bank account statements and annual summaries actually mean!
698 2018-05-31 18:28:35 Nope. The rules are very specifically written. M4s and M16s are not what is controlled, the LOWER receiver is...and ANY part that would convert a semi-auto to full auto. Bump stocks don't meet that test.
699 2018-05-31 18:27:50 I understand your argument and agree to disagree. Bump stocks' purpose is to mimic fully automatic fire, which has been banned for civilians since 1934 with very few exceptions (quite effectively).

708 2018-05-31 18:24:26 good story on the GS cheaters--many have a feeling that banks are eating trump's reduced finance regs and issuing guidance on stocks to knock them down, so that they can buy back in cheap. Can you check their trades  (MU, NVDA for example) in the weeks after they downgrade?
709 2018-05-31 18:24:00 Bump stocks do NOT make a weapon fully automatic. Which is exactly why ATF had not ruled against them.

3/ charts on valauation multiples over time say last 5 years, last 4 quarter results
It’s a great show. Good luck with changes

742 2018-05-31 18:11:35 Yes. I sold a bunch of my stocks a couple of weeks ago in anticipation of something like this. Trump has no idea of unintended consequences or the interdependence of economies. He's going to push Mexico into recession and we will feel the pain.

782 2018-05-31 17:59:32 Ct. Gov. just signed banning bump stocks effective 10/1/18.
783 2018-05-31 17:58:57 Dude, there was no spy. Move on. And this: Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Why are you afraid of the @NRA?
784 2018-05-31 17:58:29 I think the opposition has peaked prematurely. Economy picking up, oil is down. Stocks will shoot p if RBI become less hawkish here. Diwali bonanza and some of the smaller parties, such as RLD, can be peeled off MGB and SS etc. will fall in line.

786 2018-05-31 17:57:59 Because the libs tried to add a bunch of other anti 2nd amendment laws banning parts of guns that have nothing to with bump stocks only to get rid of all guns. I've got no problem getting rid of bump stock but triggers to make your gun better or sites other parts tagged onto bill

789 2018-05-31 17:56:34 Nope bump stocks are not part of constitutionally protected areas..
790 2018-05-31 17:56:16 “Sure. But our put options on UK stocks just went through the roof!” Cheered IDS, JRM, Bojo.

791 2018-05-31 17:55:21 Well at least *try* to make you lies less obvious next time    Moving on... Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Why are you afraid of the @NRA?
792 2018-05-31 17:54:31 It's the precursor to a Pump & Dump. 1st you need some bad PR to get stocks down so you can gobble up tons of shares at relatively low levels. Next, say you change your mind and will work with the Germans, stocks rebound & your buddies make out like bandits.
793 2018-05-31 17:54:10 And yet, bump stocks still exist in the world. The inanimate objects didn't just disappear at the signing of this bill. Governor Malloy forgets that he can't legislate against evil, or hate, or mental illness. A bump stock has been used once. Murder has existed forever.

804 2018-05-31 17:47:05 If you buyback stocks at these valuations you are wasting money. US Government should have not cut corporate taxes now. Deficit up, debt up. More taxes coming in the future. And companies are just wasting money in financial strategies like buybacks. Bad fiscal policy.
805 2018-05-31 17:46:51 Yeah... but it’s better for their stocks to remain privatized. If they ever go public, I don’t even want to know what’s going to happen

826 2018-05-31 17:38:42 That's exactly what the ignorant butt hole and his ultra-rich friends wants to happen. They can buy up the cheap stocks when it crashes. Then sell it high. So us lowly peasants pay more for everything, and they get all the rewards. 
827 2018-05-31 17:38:39 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?

829 2018-05-31 17:37:30 commercial arrangements are frequently structured so as to be effectively 'cost-plus'; and as I said, we cannot tell who actually owns them as their stocks are traded;  it is possible they're owned by big pharma;

835 2018-05-31 17:35:50 They have. "Jeff Sessions announces rule effectively banning bump stocks"- 23Mar2018. Effective date of the ban is 01Oct2018.
836 2018-05-31 17:35:29 In Dec, the Department of Justice announced it would launch a regulatory process “to determine whether bump stocks are prohibited.” It’s true that, under Obama, the ATF, an agency within the Justice Dept ruled that it could not prevent the use of certain models of bump stocks.

839 2018-05-31 17:35:07 Acts that get signed become laws, what the ADA is. Enforcement is done through the courts, case by case. There is no agency enforcing it. Banning bump stocks would do more good than harm. Alternative devices can be developed to facilitate firing without enabling auto rates.
840 2018-05-31 17:35:03 What these guys do is that they cut as much rock as they can and have stocks that last for at least 4yrs so it buffers them against fluctuations and also makes them massive profits when the prices are high.

844 2018-05-31 17:33:21 Idea is to cut Speculative Tendencies in these stocks but I wonder, are these more volatile than stocks in F&O for instance?
845 2018-05-31 17:33:15 Overall inventories (Total Stocks) rose on the week  1.8Mb – excluding the SPR.
846 2018-05-31 17:32:48 US commercial stocks fell by 3.6Mb on the week which supports the bullish case.

849 2018-05-31 17:32:17 he didn't legalize bump stocks, they were already legal in the marketplace,What obama administration officials actually concluded was that new restrictions on bump stocks would need to be approved by congress, rather than through new regulations created by the executive branch.
850 2018-05-31 17:32:16 So i ditched all the stocks on my watch list that took a dive the last time trump announced tariffs. Im down today but just a little. I got lucky with run so im good

855 2018-05-31 17:31:22 Since 2010, however, the ATF has taken the position that bump stocksare "not regulated as a firearm under Gun Control Act or the National Firearms Act." ... The ultimate issue is whether bump stocks turn legalweapons into (mostly) illegal machine guns.Feb 23, 2018

862 2018-05-31 17:28:00 It was the ATF that found bump stocks could not be legally banned, not Obama. Obama did pass many gun regulations, almost all rolled back by tRUMP, including a measure that previously prevented people with mental illness from buying guns.
863 2018-05-31 17:27:47 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
864 2018-05-31 17:27:43 I’m not investing in stocks until Trump is out of office. If I want a ride in the rollercoaster I’ll go to the boardwalk.
865 2018-05-31 17:27:42 Bump stocks weren’t “approved” by Obama. They didn’t fall under Gun Control Act or the National Firearms Act control the way banned items like Autoglove and Akins Accelerator did. And require legislation or EO to ban. 

Like the kind Trump promised and didn’t deliver.

873 2018-05-31 17:23:36 "Short position not hurting them"...yet.  Softest PCE print in 5 yrs yesterday in 1q, as stocks just stopped going up.  Huge potential milestone on the "US Trilemma" we discussed last week = PCE print supports point that stocks need to rise or USD cannot be allowed to.
874 2018-05-31 17:23:31 QT (desanitized tightening, normalcy) will end up just being permanent monetization of debt. Bonds as stocks. 1000 year bonds
875 2018-05-31 17:23:20 Must have missed the lines about bump stocks and 18 vs 21 age limits in the constitution... it would definitely lead to people throwing temper tantrums but civil war seems an unlikely outcome
876 2018-05-31 17:23:19 I hope he tells them he's going to ban assault weapons, bump stocks, large capacity ammo clips, and he's sorry that this happened and won't let it happen again.
877 2018-05-31 17:22:28 Oh and also..

Why don't you ban bump stocks & raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 like you said you would?

879 2018-05-31 17:21:13 As pointed out by @AadityaJ132 this is because Pidilite and three other stocks are in one of the MSCI indices from today. So the passive index portfolios which follow MSCI had to buy big quantities.

892 2018-05-31 17:16:46 Nope. He’s afraid of the millions of gun owners and the repercussions of potentially violating 2A. Banning bump stocks and raising the age requirement is retarded. Considering you have to be 21 already to buy a handgun.

897 2018-05-31 17:15:52 Not exactly. You give one inch, they take a mile. I see no good from bump stocks, but we cannot risk any movement against 2nd amend. Once a decision like that is law, it won't take much for another lib backassward judge to allow more clamps on our rights.

902 2018-05-31 17:13:34 #NY19Debate: Erin Collier says assault weapons and bump stocks should be banned and NRA money should be taken out of politics
903 2018-05-31 17:12:36 This was my initial takeaway as well... also confirms my view that the discount of value stocks matters (not just that they’re cheaper, but how much cheaper).
904 2018-05-31 17:12:18 You'd start a Civil War over bump stocks and a change in age requirements? Bold response! And proportional! I like the cut of your jib!

916 2018-05-31 17:10:18 Because banning bump stocks and raising the age will not make a difference. Get rid of gun free zones and armed security in schools.

970 2018-05-31 16:54:51 BEPL has fallen 40% after good Q4 results, done capacity expansion, became debt free too.

979 2018-05-31 16:52:18 The ADA is a law. It doesn't "get involved." There are triggers that are easy pull and many many semi-auto firearms to simplify shooting for those with hand, wrist, and arm issues (I'm one). Bump stocks simply increase the fire rate to mimic full auto.

984 2018-05-31 16:50:07 Bump stocks have been around for a long time! How many killings where caused by bump stocks? How would there be less if age was 21? Please think! This wouldn't stop anyone from getting a gun!
985 2018-05-31 16:50:03 this has definitely become a market of stocks, lots of long AND short setups abound!
986 2018-05-31 16:49:44 So wish minority share holders had half the clout as auditors now have..   a world where stocks collapse when small investors exit! Amen!!
987 2018-05-31 16:49:39 We’re discussing legal penalties for possession regardless of the place of purchase & legal precedent-Prinz v US. Possession of Machine guns is legal in a number of states.Only an anti gun-control zealot would also suggest semi-autos, bump-stocks & high cap mags are not a problem
988 2018-05-31 16:49:15 He should do something useful ,like banning bump stocks and raising legal age to purchase guns
989 2018-05-31 16:49:10 Well yes, but stocks are down 5-10% all over this year. DJIA went from 26.6K in January to about 24.5 right now. That booming Trump Economy, am I right?
990 2018-05-31 16:48:28 Why didn’t you ban bump stocks and raise the minimum age to 21 as you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
991 2018-05-31 16:48:27 Didn't you post a few blatantly idiotically false tweets about companies that caused their stocks to drop? When do you plan on calling their owners to apologize, mental midget?
992 2018-05-31 16:48:16 The plan has bonds and cash and the S&P 500 is all stocks.  1.7 for a balanced portfolio is likely close to the mark since stocks are flat and bond interest rates have gone up pushing bond prices and hence total return down.  Careful what you compare.
993 2018-05-31 16:47:56 I've  traded the markets for many years and while there has always been some devious behaviour is has been with the rise of technolgy where the manipulation game has risen to a whole new level with Dark pools, HFT, comp-algo's,  vix manipulation of stocks $QQQ $SPY $IWM $EEM $DIA

996 2018-05-31 16:45:12 Read jurisprudence from the revolutionary period to today and explain how banning bump stocks and raising the age to purchase is an infringement on constitutional rights. I'll be waiting. Oh, and our military would squash your little civil war, we spend trillions to make it so.
997 2018-05-31 16:45:10 He is literally banning cars before bump stocks

1004 2018-05-31 16:41:53 Why are you too stupid to realize that he can’t unilaterally ban bump stocks and raise the gun purchasing age to 21?

1008 2018-05-31 16:40:07 Remember 2008 under Bush? When the bubble burst.  Home prices when down by 1/2 tp 2/3s, foreclosures ran 1 in 10 in my state.  Unemployment was over 14 percent.  Stocks crashed, wiping people out of their money.  Trump is setting that back into motion, only it's going to be WORSE

1017 2018-05-31 16:38:18 wow, no need to shout. You dont buy for example apple stocks today and expect them to rise the next day. Same with footballers, player being a bargain or not is determided based on the players contribution to the club during his career as well as possible resell money brought in.
1018 2018-05-31 16:38:01 I’ve been buying bonds and slowly selling stocks for 9 months. It’s not just Trump, either. The bull market we’ve seen since the Great Recession is really long in the tooth. I would say that we’re due for a recession beginning in the next 2 years. Difficult to say how severe.
1019 2018-05-31 16:37:50 Man if it wasn’t for these darn macro headlines, we would be all time highs . Look how well these stocks acting
1020 2018-05-31 16:37:22 Oh wait, I forgot the 1,600 point drop this last February. By the end of the day, stocks recovered to 1,165. Since then, the market has only gone up 100 points. So a 250 point loss today puts the Dow behind where it was in 2017.

1026 2018-05-31 16:36:48 .@AdamLaxalt said "we led the charge of banning bump stocks.”
THE FACTS: Laxalt hardly “led the charge” 2 ban bump stocks. Instead, he’s punted to the federal government on banning the device the Las Vegas shooter used to massacre 58 people.. not once, but twice. He cant lie 2 us

1038 2018-05-31 16:34:09 Can’t help but wonder about the reasoning behind this. Is trump hoping to make their stocks crash so he and his buddies can grab it up cheap, state he isn’t going to go through with it, then sell the stock at a huge profit? Or am I way off the mark here?

1053 2018-05-31 16:24:30 it’s not that easy, bump stocks were designed as an Occupational Therapy device for people with hand & joint disabilities, a complete ban would isolate those individuals with these disabilities, & at that point the ADA is sure to get involved. More to it than just blame.

1062 2018-05-31 16:20:40 Tired of headlines proclaiming "Stocks Down on Trade War Fears". 
If the mkt is surprised the U.S. is on the cusp of numerous "trade wars", then it hasn't been paying attention for much of the last 3 yrs. 
And unless DJIA is down 1,000 points or so in a day, it's not really down.
1063 2018-05-31 16:20:13 it’s clear U.S. stocks haven’t rallied as robustly as their foreign equivalents. Moreover, with each 1,000-level increase, the accomplishment gets increasing less impressive.

1106 2018-05-31 16:07:38 Happy to explain. Here's one for starters: A law banning civilians from owning semi automatic weapons used to mow down hundreds of people in minutes would prevent shooters like the Vegas one of owning 47 WEAPONS, BUMP STOCKS, AND SEMI AUTOMATIC WEAPONS THAT PENETRATE POLICE ARMOR

1108 2018-05-31 16:07:01 Interesting read, Thanks. However, it doesn’t support your claim...

I asked for the specific bill/legislation/executive order “Obama enacted” to “legalize” them (meaning they must have been previously illegal...?).

Without it, it’s FALSE to say “Obama legalized bump stocks.”

1160 2018-05-31 15:52:13 The only reason why they will not band bump stocks or raise the legal age is because the NRA has the hand and everybody's pocket they give every single person in Congress money check Ted Cruz how much money he got off of the NRA and every other Republican
1161 2018-05-31 15:51:53 Seems that someone would rather have $TSLA up than the public safe from this #deathtrap ... kind of like the whole market! Someone wants stocks higher rather than the economy stronger! It's all about Wall Street!
1162 2018-05-31 15:51:51 Correct, no laws were passed during his administration to restrict bump stocks as the NRA would have had the republican votes to prevent any bill from passing.  Why is this Obama’s fault?

1203 2018-05-31 15:40:29 Stocks fall because the bumbling idiot in the White House doesn't know basic economics or how to conduct policy on global trade. November is coming!

1238 2018-05-31 15:31:18 You’re right. Big investors/traders keep us little investors confused:

—to scare us away from companies w/ good prospects & cheap stocks;

—to pump overpriced stocks after few investors/traders R left2 buy them—so big investors/traders can lock in profits/“fade” stocks.

1240 2018-05-31 15:31:04 Take a look at most widely owned fund stocks or take a wild guess who's at the top.
1241 2018-05-31 15:30:30 Wouldn't it just be a scream if it turned out Trump's on-again, off-again economic Tweets were directly tied to someone connected who was then shorting stocks for profits?
1242 2018-05-31 15:30:14 This is nothing, CT does not sell the rifles that use bump stocks and the biggest manufacturer has closed it's doors.  Maybe ask Luke why all of a sudden Hartford has money for fireworks?

1248 2018-05-31 15:27:42 Lol that’s nice. It still gets it out of the way. Most people won’t try to create their own bump stocks, so it’ll still bar many people from obtaining them.

1291 2018-05-31 15:18:30 Do you think this is call of duty or something? You think bump stocks decrease the time to kill in a school by 0.2 seconds giving you the maximum edge to kill people. You should probably try to learn about what your banning.
1292 2018-05-31 15:18:20 Now there are three types of stocks are available in the market - Napasand, Kampasand and Manpasand 
1293 2018-05-31 15:17:57 Bump stocks have never been used in a school shooting, so that is a mute point.
1294 2018-05-31 15:17:43 Great argument #greg , can you quote that part of #2ndA that covers bump stocks and under 21 ownership

1316 2018-05-31 15:11:59 putting a waiting period for more types of guns, and banning bump stocks will deter a lot of people from obtaining the firearms typically used in school shootings by the people of the same age as typical school shooters.
1317 2018-05-31 15:11:00 Glad you raised the issue. Legislatures across the US are banning texting while driving. So why *not* ban bump stocks, another hazard?
1318 2018-05-31 15:10:51 Where is the EO banning bump stocks you promised?  Where is the support for the Manchin-Toomey gun safety law?  Are you afraid of the NRA?
1319 2018-05-31 15:10:34 I missed the part in the Constitution that guarantees the right to own bump stocks, or the right for kids to own gubs.

1446 2018-05-31 14:41:17 The 2nd Amndmt says that you have the right to bear arms not that you have the right to bump stocks and other devices of that nature. It also mentions absolutely nothing about the age at which one can obtain an "arm". So tell me how exactly is this infringing upon the 2nd Amndmt?

Again, though, things such as banning items (bump stocks), and raising legal ages to purchase items (often state laws... anyway, not federal) is not something that can be constitutionally by President himself.
1489 2018-05-31 14:27:08 Then don’t “what if” we ban bump stocks to save lives when it has only been used in one mass shooting.  Ban social media, stop somebody from being bullied to the point of committing suicide.  After all if it saves one life and makes “me” feel better.

1553 2018-05-31 14:09:33 #Trading all about timing of buy-sell, knowing the trend.
Price of stocks and indices move all over the place in a given time period.
You should provide yourself enough time (time horizon) to get the prices you want for initial setup & close-out and to make trade profitable!

1555 2018-05-31 14:09:00 Actually it wouldn't be bump stocks are an accessory not a firearm and age limits can be determined, neither is covered by the constitution
1556 2018-05-31 14:08:55 Wth does that have to do w the tweet? You must be an absolute idiot to think banning bump stocks and raising the age to own firearms would do anything. Murder is and always has been against the law. Duh.
1557 2018-05-31 14:08:49 Sorry, But bump stocks are NOT protected by the Constitution.
1558 2018-05-31 14:08:39 Why have you not banned bump-stocks and raised the age to buy firearms to 21? Are you afraid of the NRA? Did you lie to the parents of the Parkland shooting?

1562 2018-05-31 14:08:12 This whole thread started because of the bump stock tweet. And of course Trump blamed Obama for that but still left bump stocks in place. So, I can see why David Hogg tweeted this in the first place. Not taking guns. Only regulating accessories.

1588 2018-05-31 14:00:40 Which is what this conversation is about, to make them illegal. Hence the words “ban bump stocks”. There are lots of weapons that are illegal for you to own, which still does not infringe on your right to own other weapons. Again, need vs want.

1601 2018-05-31 13:58:11 Reality. No firearms turned in after NY safe act passed. No bump stocks turned in in CO. 3 bump stocks turned in in MA. It starts with disobedience. The other side then pushes more stupidity (current step) and eventually an incident causes widespread revolt.

1611 2018-05-31 13:56:15 I agree. Perhaps as we move closer to legislation weed stocks move back up as investors gain more confidence and that rising tide floats all boats.

1720 2018-05-31 13:27:03 A consistent theme coming from this results season on the JSE is that managers are seeing, at worst, sustained higher volumes post-Feb year-ends. At best, some are even seeing growth. I think August interim-ends out later this year will surprise to upside for most SA Inc stocks.
1721 2018-05-31 13:26:35 Don't understand why! banning bump stocks does not prevent you from owning a gun, It may prevent you from using one in a certain way. As for under 21s are you saying that they are old enough and responsible enough to buy and own a gun, but not to buy alcohol?
1722 2018-05-31 13:26:35 The only thing you should be banning is bump-stocks and then raising the age to purchase firearms to 21. YOU'RE AFRAID OF THE @NRA @realDonaldTrump is a BIG BABY.
1723 2018-05-31 13:26:29 How is banning bump stocks and raising the purchase age infringing on the 2nd amendment?  Better go read it again!

1725 2018-05-31 13:25:19 Because bump stocks dont add to the lethality of a weapon. And increasing the age requirement makes no sense when 18 is the age we consider someone an adult, and is also the age that they can join the military. It's not common sense, it's pointless and unconstitutional.

1823 2018-05-31 12:58:10 The real problem is the wording of the 1934 machine gun law.  Rewrite that to cap magazine capacity and cap cyclic rate to somewhere around 800 rpm, which is the rate of a Glock 9MM pistol.  Then you can stop worrying about bump stocks and echo triggers and other workarounds.
1824 2018-05-31 12:57:58 Trump probably has a vested interest in the NRA., Stocks, bonds all that, remember Trump is a business man first everything else is secondary to him
1825 2018-05-31 12:57:33 Let's face it, people are broke due to job loss and the stocks of their employer's choosing, losing "bigly" due to market manipulation by this administration. Many will have no income when it tanks and their pensions are lost.
1826 2018-05-31 12:56:39 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA? Because you lie more than you tell the truth.
1827 2018-05-31 12:56:25 Yeah stay economicalI was looking at construction stocks todayWith big major projects on its time to look a bit closer ok
1828 2018-05-31 12:56:22 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA? Because you are a national embarrassment every day.

1833 2018-05-31 12:54:48 I say Forex is home for me because I'm a full time family man by day, so daytrading stocks during NYC time is hard for me now. I'm able to trade Forex in the evening and make a decent profit for fam. You gotta pick what is right for you at the time. @AntonKreil is a good choice.
1834 2018-05-31 12:53:29 #4 for FA’s: Please stop thinking u need to own small mid large value growth intl Em etc all the time. Think of ur portfolio like a golf bag filled with clubs.

1836 2018-05-31 12:52:14 nope.  bump stocks aren't covered by the constitution.
1837 2018-05-31 12:52:09 Why didn't you ban bump-stocks and raise the age of purchase for firearms to 21 like you said you would?  Are you afraid of the @NRA?
1838 2018-05-31 12:50:53 Can someone teach me how to do stocks and bonds and shit. Im really trying to take this shit serious.
1839 2018-05-31 12:50:38 The key to making money in stocks is not to get scared. Every year finds a spate of books on how to pick stocks or find the winning mutual fund. But all this good info is useless without willpower. In stocks, it is guts and not the head that determines results.
1840 2018-05-31 12:50:35 But when I think about it, my Forex trading style originated from how I was daytrading stocks. So I can't really say there is a definite route, you learn crazy things from failures..but @AntonKreil is right in the original tweet.
1841 2018-05-31 12:50:35 Bump stocks = las vegas.  Legal Gun owner.   Would not have been such an effective killer with out the bumpstocks.  We do not need effective killers nor bump stocks.

1844 2018-05-31 12:48:39 Can you show real correlations between your "good stuff" and future equity performance? If not, I'll continue to believe stocks go up when stuff's bad.
1845 2018-05-31 12:48:09 I fully understand the difference between an EO and a law—you rudely suggested the prior poster was stupid and had no basis for asking Trump why he didn’t ban bump stocks, so I was pointing out that you were wrong, as he promised to do so via EO.

1850 2018-05-31 12:43:37 He's been trading stocks too, if I'm not mistaken, this is actually one of few things he's done that might be legal (also true for Congressmen).

It's perfectly legal for them to trade with knowledge they're about to vote/do something that will impact specific company/industry
1851 2018-05-31 12:43:34 Why this lie? Democrats protect #2a. Just not assault weapons or bum stocks.

1860 2018-05-31 12:41:11 He has said where he stands: He supports a ban on bump stocks, he isn't going to support the ineffective gun control measures being pushed, and he isn't going to stop taking NRA money. (Which is funded by individuals who value their gun rights) Leadership =! support gun control

1865 2018-05-31 12:40:20 This is why people are incorrect when they say the tax cuts haven’t helped because stocks are flat. Things would be allot lower without them.
1866 2018-05-31 12:40:11 @realDonaldTrump Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA sir?
1867 2018-05-31 12:40:10 This is the third time in a week I've seen a copy paste comment RE: bump stocks. Check my replies. He can't. Modifications to laws protected by the second amendment need to go before Congress at the federal level. Trump cannot write an EO to scoot around that.

1869 2018-05-31 12:39:22 Bump stocks are covered by the constitution?  That’s a new one.
1870 2018-05-31 12:38:53 why are you campaigning now rather than leading the country?  Why haven't you banned bump stocks like you said you would?  Why do you lie to the American people every single day?
1871 2018-05-31 12:38:45 I hope this endorsement is the kiss of death from orange poop-midas.

Hey Spanky @realDonaldTrump, Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?

1873 2018-05-31 12:37:32 David, You need to learn how Congress works. President Trump can’t just say ban bump stocks it’s got to go through all the the steps to become a law. Read some history books so you don’t look so silly.

1875 2018-05-31 12:36:20 April personal spending data confirms US consumer started Q2 much stronger than Q1 (good for $ and stocks, bad for bonds). The 0.6% gain in spending (after 0.5% in March) gives good momentum. However, a lot is coming from lower savings (savings rate was 2.8% vs 3.8% a year ago).

1878 2018-05-31 12:35:51 Stop saying the names of the people responsible for school shootings. Stop with the blaming of victims for the actions of others. Stop giving murderers notoriety. It is what they want. Ban bump stocks, high capacity magazines, and semi-automatic riffles. #EndGunViolence

1961 2018-05-31 12:08:31 I can agree with banning bump stocks, taking guns away from Violent people. And possibly changing the age of a semi auto weapon to 21 years old. And doing background checks. (Which I go through already) but anything else Maybe pushing it.

1985 2018-05-31 12:00:36 Well I can not support banning a gun. And the @NRA and myself along with others agree on banning bump stocks.

1991 2018-05-31 11:57:47 You tank Amazon stocks with a lie. Where’s your apology?
1992 2018-05-31 11:57:47 Govt can find many irregularities and breaking of laws if it does things carefully with SEBI to penalize culprits. Like insider trading, off setting of profits with fake loss entries, fake cap advisory services, rigging penny stocks prices, Mergers & acquisitions prices etc.
1993 2018-05-31 11:57:23 Why is banning bump stocks and raising the age of purchase an infringement on the Second Amendment? It is not a wholesale ban on guns.
1994 2018-05-31 11:57:20 The ambiguity over whether Italian bonds are rates or credit products is why I like stocks. No ambiguity. When stuff's good they go up. When stuff's bad they go down. Nice, clean narratives.

1997 2018-05-31 11:55:53 Obviously more guns hasn't worked as a deterrent to prevent other gun crimes. Murder being illegal hasn't worked to deter people from commuting murder. So maybe banning assualt weapons, bump stocks and large capacity magazines is the next logical step.

1999 2018-05-31 11:55:07 @davidhogg111 Why ban bump stocks? Should we then began belt loops, or springs and blocks of wood? And why 21 to purchase a gun when you can sign your life to the military at 18? Why are you not promoting the REAL issue here? Mental illness.
2000 2018-05-31 11:55:01 Peter Lynch books has changed my entire mindset about market....yes it need wil power n lots of discipline....never get tempted towards hot stocks..
2001 2018-05-31 11:55:00 Winning is not the same as honesty, morality. ethics, and feeling as though you care about us.  For instance (small thing, really) you promised om TV several times that you would ban bump stocks.  It could be done by executive order. Since Las Vegas - no go.
2002 2018-05-31 11:54:53 We have substantial barriers to ownership of automatic weapons why not similar restrictions on bump stocks? If we can set an age restriction on guns at 16 or 17 we can just as easily set it at 21.
2003 2018-05-31 11:54:45 By Stephen Moore, the froth mouthed Trump/GOP hack who boot licks anything regarding tax cuts. The market is down, GDP growth has been revised down and wages are stagnant. The corps are using the cuts to buy their own stocks. Trickle down never worked. SAD!

2015 2018-05-31 11:49:45 The key to making money in stocks is not to get scared. Every year finds a spate of books on how to pick stocks or find the winning mutual fund. But all this good info is useless without willpower. In stocks, it is guts and not the head that determines results

2026 2018-05-31 11:46:21 Okay but it isn't when you can still own guns. Banning bump stocks doesn't infringe on your right to own a gun..nor does raising the age in which you can buy them(bumps or guns) so that's a pretty invalid addition and your sarcasm backfires so enjoy that.
2027 2018-05-31 11:46:05 Banning bump stocks will start a civil war?  Also prayer and school, ‘in God we trust’ on our money and ‘under god’ in the Pledge are unconstitutional.  Will you support my fight to end all of these clear violations of the First Amendment?

2029 2018-05-31 11:45:00 Guns itself don't kill people. It's people behind the trigger of a gun that can kill people. Ban bump stocks yes. Gunowners have to be more responsible Start holding parents responsible for there kids/teenagers actions. Charge the parents as well for there kids illegal activities

2036 2018-05-31 11:40:52 David you have plently to learn. Reason is a good start. Without it acting on pure emotion will get you nowhere long term. 21 is not reasonable, just ask the enlisted under 21. bump stocks? Guess there isn't that much interest in US. Mental health is the issue. Not ur agenda tho.

2062 2018-05-31 11:26:38 Actually I don’t think those points would infringe on the 2nd amendment as you could still form your well regulated militia with an age restriction of 21 years and bump stocks were just invented so don’t relate to 1780s laws.

2101 2018-05-31 11:11:22 Logically speaking, banning bump stocks would NOT infringe on anyone's second amendment rights since it is not a weapon, just a device for making a legal semi-automatic weapon into an illegal fully automatic weapon.
2102 2018-05-31 11:10:11 Yes and when you decide to carry a musket you can talk apples to apples. Raising age@and banning bump stocks in no way takes anyone’s rights away. Old enough to drink, you can wait 3 years to hunt a deer.

@cap so if the shorts are covering then stock is getting squeezed a little more to the upside? But there is still not enough bid volume to support more buyers coming in? And stock will tank? Or?

2107 2018-05-31 11:02:41 trump, my guy, these quotes are starting to sound more and more made up. maybe give it a rest and ban bump stocks, and raise the legal age to buy a firearm to 21 like you said you would. unless you're afraid of the @NRA

2149 2018-05-31 10:33:30 Firstly, you shouldn't start a sentence with and. Secondly they aren't saying ban guns, they are saying that it is dangerous for younger people to have guns (raise the age to 21). Finally, banning bump stocks wouldn't be banning guns, it would be banning a unnecessary attachment.

2157 2018-05-31 10:28:27 Yes the markets are facing a lot of volatility on #domestic as well as global front, however one can keep a bucket list of stocks ready and invest in quality companies at reasonable valuations for a longer term.
2158 2018-05-31 10:28:13 This way if the market crashes, you already made some gains before it crashes, if it rallies, you still own part of those stocks that are still going up.
2159 2018-05-31 10:27:49 Oh your right to bump stocks is in the constitution? Must have missed that part. Kiddo.
2160 2018-05-31 10:27:24 The first bias is treating those stocks as free money. Because they are called "Stock Grants", and because you didn't get the cash and then paid for them. This creates an illusion that this is free money and you can take higher risk on them. THEY ARE NOT FREE.
2161 2018-05-31 10:26:51 Please explain why a high school civics class would be needed to ban bump stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms.
2162 2018-05-31 10:26:23 You can get market like returns using index funds with low effort and low risk. So choosing individual stocks or funds - which is less diversified and thus more risky - only makes sense if you want to beat the market.

2177 2018-05-31 10:18:23 FYI, I am not a juvenile. DO YOUR RESEARCH! Florida did not ban any guns. The only thing banned was bump stocks. Get it right. AR-15 assault rifles used in SD and other school shootings still exist. Where did you get your information? You think you know better. Not #Band-AidFix

2180 2018-05-31 10:15:58 Bump stocks aren’t firearms, therefore wouldn’t even touch the constitution n age restrictions aren’t specified in the amendment sooooooo again wouldn’t hurt, how about a gun ban. Something that works for once.

2201 2018-05-31 09:56:57 Bump stocks aren’t a Constitutional right. The right to own guns has no age restriction. Legislation on either doesn’t violate your rights.

2204 2018-05-31 09:54:34 On “The Street”, the distinction is quite clear: bonds are mercantilist, while stocks are capitalist. The mercantilist demands their usury, whether a company is successful or not. The capitalist buys and holds a stock which pays high dividends, selling a stock which does not.
2205 2018-05-31 09:53:57 The popularity of our #CheckersLittleGarden campaign has totally blown us away. Our seedling kits are available while stocks last. As we are now nearing the end of the promotion, some stores will begin running out of stock.
2206 2018-05-31 09:53:56 As i agree bump stocks should never have even been on the market unfortunately mental illness is the issue not guns. And until mental illness is addressed in people nothing is gonna change. And these video games children play now a days.

2261 2018-05-31 09:20:01 It wouldn’t. 1) Bump-Stocks are not an essential part of the weapon, therefore not the weapon itself, therefore not protected. 2)The 2A states the right to „keep and bear“ arms, not purchasing them at any age.

2264 2018-05-31 09:18:20 Actually bump stocks aren’t mentioned in the Constitution. And an age limit adjustment would be an amendment to the constitution. Similar to how 2A is an amendment to the constitution. You should read the constitution.

2313 2018-05-31 08:35:41 Don’t disagree w/main point or with increasing inequality (esp of wealth). But chart is problematic.  “Expansion” did not end in 2012. Arguably for bottom 70% who own few stocks, did not begin until 2012 when home values began climbing. And for many blacks, not until even later.

2437 2018-05-31 07:04:18 RT TheBullBull "s65270 Yes it did. However sometimes relying on just one indicator can be a mistake UNLESS you are continuously tracking the stock.

In today's market, many folks pick up screener stocks and then check TAFA. so it's best to rely on a combo."
2438 2018-05-31 07:04:18 RT TheBullBull "s65270 If price less than 50 bucks, then volume should be at least 75000+ for liquid stocks

For FNO stocks volumes should be in lakhs

For high priced stocks like mrf, volume of 3000 or so is considered high."

2495 2018-05-31 06:31:00 No, it wouldn't be. Bump-stocks are not firearms, so you have no constitutional right to them (like suppressors). There's already an age limit on when you can own a gun, and it's changed over the years- making it 21 wouldn't be unconstitutional, either, buddy-boy.

2523 2018-05-31 06:10:34 Sometimes true, oftentimes not. Depends on if using a broker for noobs (e.g. Schwabs, Ameritrade) or one for pros (e.g. IB). Also sometimes depends on trade size or stock price. Pricing structure for stocks is generally quite twisted (in a bad way).

2565 2018-05-31 05:47:28 It doesn’t infringe anyone’s rights. Nowhere in the document does it stipulate that there cannot be an age requirement, and bump stocks are not included in any rights. Try again.

2576 2018-05-31 05:41:45 Stock market has absolutely no relevance in determining how the average American is doing. 40% of Americans can't afford a 400$ emergency, let alone buy stocks, and enough at that to see a difference when the market fluctuates. You're squawking elite talking points.
2577 2018-05-31 05:41:31 Where in the 2A does it say you have the right to own bump-stocks and you have a right at a specific age???
2578 2018-05-31 05:40:33 Stocks with +1 Billion floats / OS can’t go straight up. These need to be churned and supported at each level along the way. IF they are the real deal they will eventually hit the target..

2582 2018-05-31 05:37:42 Don’t be patronizing, Spencer. It dilutes anything you have to say. Bump stocks are unnecessary and would be an easy ban. Even the NRA announced supporting such restrictions. The 2nd Amendment says “well-regulated”; a minimum age, as with alcohol, would be in line with that.

2616 2018-05-31 05:12:24 Sorry but I need an explanation as to why bump stocks would be an infringement of the 2nd amendment . A bump stock is not a weapon but an attachment so technically it would not violate 2nd amendment. These young adults are our future talk to them right.

2669 2018-05-31 04:33:23 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
2670 2018-05-31 04:33:23 Dude, banning bump stocks is pointless. Do you not know anything about guns? People can make a bump stock faster than it took you to think up your lame catch phrases on CNN.
2671 2018-05-31 04:32:58 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
2672 2018-05-31 04:32:13 If you can go take a cold shower to lessen your Trump-hate boner, you might see that Trump has been in the process of signing a law to ban bump stocks for a few months. 

Executive orders like Obama used arent good enough. So there is absolutely a need to discuss for correctness.
2673 2018-05-31 04:31:23 The idea that banning bump stocks would incite a civil war is top shelf bonkers.

 Bump stocks do absolutely nothing to increase rate of fire. Have you ever used an official assault rifle? Have you ever used a weapon with a bump stock? I'm guessing you have not. I have used both many times. Bump stocks do not control rate of fire.

Such as age or weapon restrictions. Full autos, nukes, and many others are illegal to own already, why not bump stocks.

2712 2018-05-31 04:09:53 You obviously know nothing about bump stocks.  It takes a seasoned user to gain any advantage from one.  Most people shoot less accurately and may not even get off as many rounds.  No one I know uses one.
2713 2018-05-31 04:09:29 Bump stocks and upping age to buy guns is not, sir, an infringement on the 2nd amendment! Look it up!!

2719 2018-05-31 04:05:26 Ds believe there was actually a meeting on prison reform ... Rs know the meeting was about private prisons how to divvy up the stocks, how to retain non violent inmates longer (after cannabis laws change) when pot user aren't sent to prison, etc.
2720 2018-05-31 04:05:14 I get that, but banning guns like the AR15 and bump stocks bans the majority of rifles out there.

2728 2018-05-31 04:00:42 I believe it is both a mental healt issue & a gun issue. No kid/teen should be able to access guns. The minimim age should be 21 federally. We need to ban bump stocks & enact universal background checks.

2735 2018-05-31 03:56:02 Obama has 8 years to ban bump stocks. How about calling him out or is this just cheap Trump bashing?
2736 2018-05-31 03:56:01 I agree about bump stocks (kind of dumb in the first place it totally ruins accuracy from what I hear) but I'm a little disappointed about the age limit, of course it changes as soon as I turn 18 
2737 2018-05-31 03:55:53 Sarah has no answers to this kid's basic and reasonable question. This isn't hard. We need universal background checks, to fix NICS, red flag laws, and to ban autofire techonology like bump stocks.
2738 2018-05-31 03:55:17 There have been school shootings that go back into 1800’s. One teacher actually strangled a student who accidentally killed his bird. The teacher was then shot by the father. It’s the multiples that’s new. AR’s, bump stocks and large volume magazines are the new variable.

2758 2018-05-31 03:41:53 Bump stocks do serve a purpose: they force a semiautomatic weapon to fire at a much higher rate than they are designed to. That increased rate skews aim badly.This means that the only real reason to have one is to indiscriminately spray bullets into a crowd of people.

2762 2018-05-31 03:39:41 The second amendment gives us the right to bare arms. Banning bump stocks in no way infringes upon that right. Our forefathers had the foresight to give us the ability to repair wrongs with new amendments even if it did. They were wise.

2783 2018-05-31 03:32:25 Highly volitile day..as today expiry..stocks can move in big ways...be alert n most importantly dnt panic if u r shrt...today we will have gdp data..as per my study dis will be worst gdp number..in last 4yrs.relax stay calm.
2784 2018-05-31 03:32:20 Spying. plus If u kno the fundamentals of a stock, u instantly kno who r the ppl trading it. Institutions dont randomly buy stocks.they look 4 SPECIFIC things. If the stock doesnt meet those criteria, they either daytrade it or avoid it. that leaves u with mostly retail/chats/MMs
2785 2018-05-31 03:32:06 No one heard of bump stocks till Vegas. And let’s not blame the bump stock since it cannot pull the trigger without H.I. (Human Intervention) so to be clear. No single bullet was fired from a single gun without the help of a what? A Human. Like blaming the spoon...
2786 2018-05-31 03:31:48 I need to talk to Todd Man I really don’t trust stocks at all I’ll get property tho. But i feel like People are the only asset
2787 2018-05-31 03:30:48 3 things, Spencer:
1. "amendments" can be, well...amended.
2. "bump stocks" are not in the constitution.
3. saying "kiddo" is only ok if you raised @davidhogg111 from birth.
2788 2018-05-31 03:30:27 Julio about to learn next week when I get low pros for my stocks alv
2789 2018-05-31 03:30:18 Ban bump stocks and make sure to get out and vote in November!!!  #banBumpStocks
2790 2018-05-31 03:29:41 Your delusional! Stocks up almost 40% , GDP up 2%, higher, immigration down 50% since he took office! We R respected again by foreign ctry's
2791 2018-05-31 03:29:12 No not really. I like bump stocks but everyone seems to forget the well regulated part of that amendment.
2792 2018-05-31 03:29:10 Were AR-15s and bump stocks around when the second amendment was written?
2793 2018-05-31 03:28:34 Probably retire and trade penny stocks on a beach somewhere if there’s wifi
2794 2018-05-31 03:28:28 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?

2796 2018-05-31 03:27:11 By the way, fyi...we would all love 1cent a day.  That's a lot in OTC, remember we buy stocks that are a 1000th or a 100th 0f a cent(penny) so even a tick or 2 up from our entry is real gains.. Study!
2797 2018-05-31 03:26:53 #M&M - WATCH LOOKING GOOD TO BUY ABOVE 901 ANS SELL BELOW 890 TARGET AND STOP LOSS YOURS , TRADE WITH CAUTION   #equity #market #share #stock #intraday #cnbc_aawaz #StockMarket #stocks #NSE #BSE #sensex #Futures #Call #put #smallcap #options
2798 2018-05-31 03:26:50 So, if your perceived right to have semiautomatic weapons, bump stocks, gun-show loopholes and poor background checks costs the lives of innocent children.  Its bot compromise. Its our right to demand protection and safety. The second amendment says the right to bear arms.
2799 2018-05-31 03:26:45 It probably was a small crowd (like your tiny hands). Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
2800 2018-05-31 03:26:40 (MARKET VIEW - 31st May) - Nifty is likely to open strong today due to strong Global market cues. Nifty has very good support at 10550 whereas resistance is at 10740. #equity #market #share #stock #intraday #cnbc_aawaz #StockMarket #stocks #NSE #BSE #sensex #Futures #Call #put

2803 2018-05-31 03:25:12 Why don't u ask Obama? He did nothing while many many many school shootings occurred under his watch. Maybe cause bump stocks or banning ar15's is pointless and he knew it
2804 2018-05-31 03:24:45 Maybe he doesn't want to legitimize you. Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
2805 2018-05-31 03:24:39 Where does the right to bear bump stocks appear in the constitution? Also where does it make any reference to age? #factsmatter
2806 2018-05-31 03:24:16 Seriously. Most of these youngsters who trade through #robinhood and only knows #crypto and a few tech stocks have no idea what a company in resturcturing looks like or a bear market.

2808 2018-05-31 03:23:54 Mormonleaks has shown recently that the #LDS church has more than $32bn in stocks.

The LDS church donates approximately $40m in humanitarian aid yearly.

This is less than 1% of their worth per year. This seems... Really wrong, to me.

2810 2018-05-31 03:23:25 It's better to build your acct with stocks u feel confident in. It takes time,  learning charts and knowing when to hold winners and when 2 accept loss on losers.  U can easily build ur $1k into a big acct. Don't be too eager.  Know your DD. Read all u can
2811 2018-05-31 03:23:24 Actually, unregulated markets reach equilibrium and parity with market demand/supply much more rapidly than regulated markets. In a short time,  token markets will be much more efficient than stocks would be my guess

2834 2018-05-31 03:12:12 Because I thought @davidhogg111 expressed it very well. Banning bump stocks and raising the purchase age are sensible, bipartisan ways to reduce gun violence without infringing 2nd amendment rights.

2849 2018-05-31 03:03:50 Bump stocks are banned. Raising the age to 21 to buy a gun will do nothing.

2866 2018-05-31 03:01:09 Right, bump stocks are the reason behind all of the mass shootings -  seriously? Fade away, get a real education, learn about the 2nd ammendment and Constitution, and come back in 20 years a real American.
2867 2018-05-31 03:00:56 Sometimes macros factor too plays important role in a sector going strong. Currently all IT stocks are going strong. While Fii's exiting all other sector had been increasing their position in IT as they know there exit will make IT stocks more profits coz of weak rupee.

2979 2018-05-31 02:13:39 David Hogg, Bump Stocks were intended for folks who have disabilities, this tool enabled them to have an opportunity to enjoy shooting their guns for pleasure.  Take a look at the folks who are identified as shooters, they all have mental issues.

2989 2018-05-31 02:11:24 The seller stops selling bump stocks.  There’s no law in place, yet.  Gun sellers are taking their own stand because *they* care.  45 did an about face right after meeting with the NRA.

2991 2018-05-31 02:11:17 Yes it did. However sometimes relying on just one indicator can be a mistake UNLESS you are continuously tracking the stock.

In today's market, many folks pick up screener stocks and then check TAFA. so it's best to rely on a combo.

3040 2018-05-31 01:49:20 Trading stocks I used to wake at 9.30am (half hour to scan reports) and was out of the market by 10.39 am.

Crypto takes 18hrs of my life per day !

I'm not complaining at all.
3041 2018-05-31 01:48:41 It’s not fair to label seagulls as flying rats. They’re sea birds, and should be getting their food at sea, but urbanisation has forced them to look for food inland because fish stocks have depleted. You can’t hate them for doing what people have forced them to do.
3042 2018-05-31 01:47:06 I acknowledge that there is no "magic bullet" that will stop all mass shootings, but stricter background checks, banning bump stocks and high capacity magazines would slow them down, and that is a good place to start
3043 2018-05-31 01:46:51 Still wondering. Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? 
Are you afraid of the @NRA?
3044 2018-05-31 01:44:21 Make it a 17th Century Village sitcom.

She could make a Cameo performance where she's in the Stocks. – bij Area 51 UFO Hangar
3045 2018-05-31 01:44:03 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
3046 2018-05-31 01:43:29 As I am going through charts, a lot of stocks stopped right at resistance. Makes me wonder if there more bloodbath in coming days.
3047 2018-05-31 01:43:27 Stop putting words in my mouth and try actually answering a question I've asked you twice already: do you support the ban on bump stocks or not?
3048 2018-05-31 01:43:13 May 31, 2018: As of 9:40 a.m., PSEi 7,526.78 up 56.64 points or 0.76 percent. PSEi opened at 7,496.11. #PSEi #stocks
3049 2018-05-31 01:42:45 When will you ban bump stocks and raise the age of purchase to 21, as you said you would?
3050 2018-05-31 01:42:41 The NRA is not a gun manufacturer. It is an organization that is used to protect the #2A and to inform people of what the actual problems at hand are which, sorry to tell you, but it's not bump stocks.
3051 2018-05-31 01:42:35 Middle class cuts are temp and the biz cuts are permanent.  Not being able to claim Real Estate taxes in states with State tax (much of the North East and West Coast)  get majorly fucked. He gave you stocks to steal your sneakers.
3052 2018-05-31 01:42:17 I started to have better trades wen I start to trade the same stocks over and over. A go to list and if ther isn’t nothing ready to trade. I just use IBD digital for new stocks and that have same me so much time in my life. In 30 min I send about 4-6 stocks a day to the chat room
3053 2018-05-31 01:42:11 Why didn’t you ban bum stocks like you say as you would. Instead you fawning over kk

3058 2018-05-31 01:39:45 DUMP and sell off netflix stocks
3059 2018-05-31 01:38:23 What? You mean it is not the NRA, bump stocks, buying age, or Trump? Surely not the liberal news.
3060 2018-05-31 01:36:51 Phil Fisher in ‘Common Stocks’: “The financial community remembered the Civil War was followed by the panic of ‘73...after WW1 came an even worse crash of ‘29...& since WW2 was a greater effort an even bigger bear mkt. must be on the horizon...thus stocks were a...bargain”.

3075 2018-05-31 01:33:07 Stock? Stocks are so the last century!!
Coins are the future. I do recommend $zco. Huge in India.
3076 2018-05-31 01:33:05 Mr Lim, short selling of stocks is not helping our market. Hooe we coikd do without it.
3077 2018-05-31 01:32:51 I suspect that shredding machines stocks are up today!
3078 2018-05-31 01:32:07 Disney is way more than vacations, but only a child minded fool would assume that is what I was talking about, stocks are down this week and as more and more people continue to find other avenues those trends will continue

3081 2018-05-31 01:29:54 18 yr olds go to war to protect you with much bigger guns. Bump stocks are very hard to use and are not accurate, just a novelty item. People who wish to do harm will always find a way. We have to fix the why! Government laws are not the fix, you, me, and every person on earth is
3082 2018-05-31 01:28:54 Stocks rebound as Italy and EU risks look like getting resolved #markets #EU #uk #USD
3083 2018-05-31 01:28:47 Again stuck on bump stocks. Do some research and find out how many crimes are committed with rifles with bump stocks.  I’ll bet you only find one. Horrific as it was, there are bigger issues. Bullying. Illegal guns. Gangs. Drug abuse.
3084 2018-05-31 01:28:03 Keep your word, ban bump-stocks to protect innocent children like the kid reporter.  @PressSec had no answer because it's hard to lie to a kid while you're looking right at him!  Oh yeah, I see you have a new @FLOTUS replacement!!
3085 2018-05-31 01:27:55 Are you that dumb? Bump stocks and age are not the problem! The answer is, Bullying needs to stop, kids need to be taught to respect life and each other, parents need to be parents, schools need to stop removing good programs, and teachers need to be paid more, kids need love!
3086 2018-05-31 01:27:54 I'm convinced that Conservatives replenish their stocks from a warehouse where Human failures are discarded.

3095 2018-05-31 01:24:59 Them US And Chinese Tech stocks in the port are doing really well. Meanwhile PSEi stocks on port hitting their stops, one after another.

3097 2018-05-31 01:23:50 ♧ people like that should be burned alive at stake or publicly executed, put in the old laughing stocks for everyone to see and throw things at.

3100 2018-05-31 01:22:43 i'm currently looking for a mirrorless camera and i stumbled upon a product video for one of fujifilm's ~latest offerings~ and they have SOME NERVE adding a feature to put a film-esque filter over your photos to create the look of the same film stocks that they keep discontinuing
3101 2018-05-31 01:21:32 This guy at Barnes and Noble's been loudly trying to get people to sign up for his website, ineptly attempting to explain how stocks work, and attempting to flirt and/or argue with representatives from Charles Schwab over the phone for 45 minutes and it's been a wild ride
3102 2018-05-31 01:21:08 They could start with what Dipshit said he would do- raise the legal age to 21 and ban bump stocks.
3103 2018-05-31 01:19:00 The buying part 
I'm so poor invest in in stocks is a great idea...if I had money to buy stocks

3105 2018-05-31 01:16:57 ban bump stocks now. right now.
3106 2018-05-31 01:14:08 Hi Eric. IMHO best #uranium #stocks to own are those with world-class high-grade #U3O8 assets + strong M&A takeout premium potential, highly-leveraged to rising #U3O8 prices  Fission $FCU & Denison $DML fit that model, imho. NexGen $NXE & Energy Fuels $EFR also great plays.

3109 2018-05-31 01:12:55 Everything he promised? So aca has been repealed and replaced in 30 days? His tax teturns were released? Mexico is paying for the wall? And those tax cuts are a one time deal. Watch what happens next. Gas prices already climbing and stocks are shaky at best but yeah, good point
3110 2018-05-31 01:12:47 There were no photos of bump stocks released. Can you find them?
3111 2018-05-31 01:12:38 @HPitcher for story stocks...stocks with great stories like $HEAR
3112 2018-05-31 01:10:09 @PressSec this Administration is taking nothing serious about gun control. He said in a meeting to raise the age to 21, ban all bump stocks and then met with the NRA. And now nothing is being done. Bought off by the NRA again. Sorry but your tears me absolutely nothing

3119 2018-05-31 01:04:49 You DO know bump stocks can be made at home right?
3120 2018-05-31 01:04:36 I sold a bunch of stocks to buy 250K shares of $EQLB and 1M shares of $UPZS. Let’s hope this was a smart move and we become very wealthy soon.
3121 2018-05-31 01:03:36 When markets get rolling and have a multi week trend move there are typically 2-4 themes that play pass the baton in terms of leading the market forward. Remember, money flows in to sectors not just individual stocks.

3126 2018-05-31 01:00:01 Next, Tax Reform approved. Wrong, I know Rand Paul and I think that just wont let them know that Brennan had detaile. Elected, your stocks would be leaving the Apprentice, he was nominated. Lake Worth Inlet Station, in Riviera Beach! Brussels, Belgium this afternoon!
3127 2018-05-31 00:59:59 Shithead. Why don’t you ask Obama why he approved sales of bump stocks?? Get off your knees and quit worshiping him. You’re just an ignorant jackass looking for attention though.
3128 2018-05-31 00:59:52 If I’m paying 6 dollars for a shake than it better invest half of itself in stocks and manage my portfolio for the next 30 years.
3129 2018-05-31 00:59:41 Limiting the Volker rule is allowing a gambling addict go to a casino. It the reason congress passed Financial control laws. Remember the housing/credit crash and the banks involvement. It took stocks about 6 yrs to recover
3130 2018-05-31 00:59:27 You have a great laugh + build content on the fb page "asx penny stocks"

3140 2018-05-31 00:55:39 Where are your tax returns that you promised, Spanky?

Where's the ban on bump stocks that you promised, Spanky?

Where's the Mexican money to pay for your wall, Spanky?
3141 2018-05-31 00:53:33 You’re a cerebrum challenged young man david. Banning bump stocks isn’t going to stop kids from dying. The minute you wake up and realize it’s NOT about the guns, you’ll be intelligent. It’s about YOUR generation. Always been guns just not  weaklings that need attention.
3142 2018-05-31 00:53:24 Please ban bump stocks
3143 2018-05-31 00:52:48 Yep. But they should feel entirely different than in 1998. In 98, the hot stocks were not durable, competitively advantaged market leaders trading at reasonable multiples of free cash flow.
3144 2018-05-31 00:52:10 Stocks move in small bursts,that's Y I find it hard to buy a stock that's already up 3-5days in a row,regardless if its a cookie cutter b/o
3145 2018-05-31 00:51:40 When you ban things people don’t listen. Several states banned bump stocks and told people to turn in their bump stocks. Under 10 were turned in and it’s months past the deadline. Drugs are not legal yet we still have a huge problem. Banning things and raising ages doesn’t work

3150 2018-05-31 00:49:30 Not a good idea to put your money long term into penny stocks. You won't make money like that.
3151 2018-05-31 00:49:08 In this bios tape, cheap interesting stocks are actually quite plentiful..  if I am not as bearish as with LT view.. I may even break my no more than a dozen rule and make room for new entries.. but rules are rules..  gotta make choices.. my bias continue to be LT bearish.
3152 2018-05-31 00:48:40 Prison reform. Prisons are business with stocks. Currently US has more prisoners then what was in gulags in USSR. more prisoners stocks are going up. Bush family invested in prison stock market.

3159 2018-05-31 00:46:55 Bam bump stocks.

3162 2018-05-31 00:45:07 Do not blame Trump for the bump stocks, they were made legal by the Obama administration. Trump can only fix so much so fast. He has only had a year and a half to fix all the crap that damn Democrats did over the last 8 years. Grow up.
3163 2018-05-31 00:44:43 A ban on high capacity magazines, bump stocks, AR-15 style designs, etc. It’s not that hard and it’ll be effective. We’ve already had an Assault Weapons Ban. It should be reinstated.
3164 2018-05-31 00:44:26 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
3165 2018-05-31 00:44:13 I understand, & no one is saying to take away your guns, just have more control over who gets them, etc. Your argument sounds like you all feel “defenseless” without the “big guns”(& bump stocks, etc). Coming from a background of no guns around ever, it’s very hard to understand.
3166 2018-05-31 00:43:32 Most of fall stocks were related to HSR, MRT projects.. i noticed most of previous gov project were down since BN lost in last election. No big issue right now but the Gov need to monitor this situation closely.
3167 2018-05-31 00:43:12 @Hillhick @Nexenn @jnjlong4ever you buying options or stocks?
3168 2018-05-31 00:42:55 First priority should be taking care of the people that make them rich. If I'm making money on their stocks but have to pay the government double to cover their workers health benefits then what's the point. Great for the ceo but sucks to be the middle class!
3169 2018-05-31 00:41:07 Porn..the reason my house did not sell, the reason my stocks took a dump,why Santa Claus doesn’t visit my family,why my dog bites people!!
3170 2018-05-31 00:40:44 Still waiting for people to care about inner city kids. But those shooter kids shouldn't get publicized, no bump stocks, and no AR-15s. That in theory would save about 400 lives per year if laws are followed by potential criminals. Why no focus on the ghetto?

3177 2018-05-31 00:33:17 Because law abiding gun iwners need bump stocks. Right.
3178 2018-05-31 00:32:58 $AFMD better chance to run in short term.  I’m alittle more confident in $CALA long term but both could be big winners in the next 5 years.  You seem a person who likes quick hitters.  If so these stocks aren’t for you right now.  These are ones you buy and put away LT
3179 2018-05-31 00:32:21 You ban bump stock guess what most people that are avid gun users can make a homemade bump stocks guess I just answered your question huh? Why do you act like you were there when you tell interviews you rode your bike there when ur sister called you? Age had nothing to do with it
3180 2018-05-31 00:31:42 I've had a long think about this.  Say there are two stocks with identical setups (based on my edge) making all time highs. I hold only one, which happens to be the one that is just shorted by a successful short only fund. Would I switch?
Honestly I'm really not sure! Would you?

3188 2018-05-31 00:28:53 Remember when Trump said he was going to ban bump stocks and raise legal purchase age of rifles to 21? I sure do. Then that terrorist organization the NRA had a talk with him and suddenly all that went away. #banthenra
3189 2018-05-31 00:28:25 Was it during their 2018 calendar photo shoot when they were reading their horoscopes & Yoongi mentioned, don’t invest on stocks, we‘re not allowed to? I was really worried that they can’t do even such simple investment. Now I know why, it’s because of this. Their money‘s safe.

3193 2018-05-31 00:27:30 The Santa Fe High School shooter was only 17 years old, so raising the age limit from 18 to 21 would be pointless.
And if you ban bump stocks then you would need to ban rubber bands and strings too, as they can be used with the same effect.

Are you tried of always being wrong?

3198 2018-05-31 00:25:52 I miss my cat so much ALL SUMMER STOCKS SHOULD LET YOU BRING PETS!!!!
3199 2018-05-31 00:25:25 not really. Celebrities always went to the WH and talked about issues they have no idea about and the stock market always had over valued stocks.
3200 2018-05-31 00:25:18 Today, 31st May 2018, perhaps the most significant developments in global finance + economics to look out for; 1. The launch of the MSCI Index with Chinese companies' stocks as part of the EM basket. 2. The G7 meeting of finance ministers & central bank governors in Canada.
3201 2018-05-31 00:24:59 That’s really good! If it was 17won/share that time.. BH value has since grown double? 100x? 200x? BTS and BH employees are getting richer!
If they go public, it is wise to invest on BH stocks at the start.
3202 2018-05-31 00:23:42 You really don’t know what buying back stocks means, do you?
3203 2018-05-31 00:23:25 gross domestic product increased at a 2.2% annual rate, instead of the previously reported 2.3% pace.
Energy stocks reacted well to higher oil prices as @ExxonMobil surged 3.9%, @ConocoPhillips jumped 3.6%, @Chevron rose 3.1% and Schlumberger gained 2.1%.
3204 2018-05-31 00:23:00 US stocks rose sharply on Wednesday, rebounding from the previous day’s rout, as energy shares bounced back amid a rally for oil prices and worries over Italy’s political crisis faded.
3205 2018-05-31 00:22:54 He did ban bump stocks. And nobody under the age of 21 can own a pistol.
3206 2018-05-31 00:22:54 If he bans bump stocks he’ll have to ban belt loops too. There’s always a way.
3207 2018-05-31 00:22:29 Can't blame the effort seeing how the #GOPTaxScam has allowed private corporations to buy back their stocks at the cost of their employees and said employees' hard work. But goal here is to inform and spread truth. That is my goal, as much as possible.
3208 2018-05-31 00:22:12 So Joe, are you claiming no one in the Middle Class is able or capable or buying/investing in stocks?  Why are you so racist, sexist, biased and ignorant about stock purchasers?  You must have Analytics backing up your claim, correct?

3213 2018-05-31 00:20:31 He’s right. ETFs have a huge unintended consequence: stocks with bad fundamentals that are part of a particular ETF are rewarded with share price appreciation when they don’t deserve it. Bottom-up stock-picking will be more important than ever once The Drop happens.
3214 2018-05-31 00:19:34 39.7 career 2P%. That's just gross. 2.2 career stocks%, so he isn't helping all that much on that end either. In that range in the second, might as well take a chance on say Duval and try to rework his shot than thinking Carr will get more athletic.

3220 2018-05-31 00:15:03 Exactly my point! Don't you think some highly destructive weapons should be out of reach because some people will misuse them? 

Guns are fun, but I don't need bigass magazines and bump stocks in my home.  There's a range for that!

What do you want? She deleted the tweet, admitted it was bad taste, apologised, asked her fans not to defend her over it, and lost her job. So what now? locked in stocks? Public flogging? What will satisfy your bloodlust?
