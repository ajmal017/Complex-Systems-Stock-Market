3 2018-09-10 23:57:25 NLST went bananas who else is watching stocks?
4 2018-09-10 23:57:14 equities at nosebleed levels. Note aggregate global QE increased every year thru 2017. It took more and more to keep stocks rising. And if QE were at high enough valuations, everyone would simply sell to the Fed, and they own the market. Bad outcome on a number of dimensions.
5 2018-09-10 23:56:18 When you cannot trust the currencies of government influx and when it's not safe to invest in stocks, gold is a logical place to stash cash as an umbrella

8 2018-09-10 23:55:30 bear markets are needed to clean out the froth and destroy the frauds, grifts and ponzi finance stuff. Once stocks come down a lot, they can (probably) resurrect it with QE (and by then, there will be tons of Treasuries/deficits to soak up). Don't think QE would work well with
9 2018-09-10 23:55:10 The Beto guy has been arrested twice and charges dropped both times.  He violated Rules of buying stocks at IPO prices and was charged on that, the charges were dropped.  Sounds as though he's been around the block with breaking all the laws and rules. #Votenobeto

11 2018-09-10 23:54:52 Five years ago (I became disabled) I sold stocks in my 401k and took the tax hit. THANK GOD! It was a pretty good amount, put all of it down on a house. Today my 40 yr. mortgage is $319 mo. Were it not for this, I'd be living on the street.

19 2018-09-10 23:51:02 I used to have a chart that loosely tied national average cash price for a marketing year to ending stocks to use. It will be interesting to see what the 2017-2018 es/u turns out to be, for both soybeans & corn, with the Sep 28 QS report.

43 2018-09-10 23:49:16 And to the great, wise @jordanbpeterson who, unless he was hacked, also weighed in with a powerful barrage of sense.  I mean, what are @syptweet playing at?  Unless the judiciary has gone completely mad, they would be laughing stocks from logic alone.
44 2018-09-10 23:47:47 Ok fam whatever you say. Do you trade stocks? If not you’d have no understanding of my point. And their still talking about 31% sales growth since last week how long can you have the same % if everyone’s buying? Makes no sense stats don’t just stop all of a sudden
45 2018-09-10 23:45:58 .@POTUS44 claims job rate is same under @POTUS, while this is essentially true. However, discounting your first year in office, your average GDP has been less the half of the current GDP avg. for Mr. Trump. @The_Trump_Train However, look at consumer confidence, stocks, etc.

48 2018-09-10 23:43:58 What Obama did for me was drive my monthly health care costs through the roof, My personal Blue Cross Blue Shield went from $450.00 a month up to $800.00 dollars per month.   I never made any gains on my stocks and wrote off loss.
49 2018-09-10 23:43:41 You could own stocks just like the wealthy do.
50 2018-09-10 23:43:31 Semi automatic: One trigger pull, one bullet fired. Like pistols or majority of rifles. 

Automatic: one trigger pull, bullets are fired until trigger is let go. Like when bump stocks are used or most call of duty’s. 

I don’t like lobbying but we need to protect the 2A.
51 2018-09-10 23:42:43 In stocks you have P/E ratio... It is valuable because business is becoming more valuable over time and you can check the book value easily. Cryptocurrency rankings are like rankings on Google - rarely who will go to 4th page in search for good opportunity.
52 2018-09-10 23:42:39 Sadly passed away. Sorry couldn't hear your complaints about stocks or earnings.
53 2018-09-10 23:42:12 Great!
I will draw more girls' shoes, socks,stocks and feet played show!
54 2018-09-10 23:42:05 watching the destruction of capital from shareholders in gold mining stocks is fascinating. It's a good lesson that yes, things can get worse. Ignoring the relative weakness and negative momentum has proven costly to the stubborn. Good lessons for all of us to recognize $GDX
55 2018-09-10 23:42:05 Lets see I own my own small business, My taxes were paid quarterly and I was paying a little over 4k  per month.  This year with the tax cuts I am under 2k per quarter.  My stocks are through the roof, under Obama my stock did nothing... I can retire 2 years earlier so far.

“For the vast majority of Americans, fluctuations in the stock market have relatively little effect on their wealth, or well-being, for that matter,” said Edward N. Wolff, an economist at NYU.
57 2018-09-10 23:40:37 The stocks have never  been higher 
58 2018-09-10 23:39:33 The stocks are in a state of ketosis!

60 2018-09-10 23:39:16 Facts One. Elon Musk is a genius. Fact two Elon Musk wants to take his company private. Is it possible he's scaring away shareholders to buy stocks up at a lower price. Sounds like something a genius would do...
61 2018-09-10 23:38:36 I’ve made beef and chicken stocks, but I’ve never thought to mix the types of bones. Always learning something new here!
62 2018-09-10 23:36:52 HK Govt did just that and bought stocks during the Asian financial crisis. It received so much criticism from everyone inducing banks like MS, experts and analysts all joined the party citing Govt should never interfere markets. This will be controversial.
63 2018-09-10 23:36:48 Give everything you own including ALL your money & future royalties, stocks, everything except the clothes on your back... Then i'll reconsider calling you a number one HYPOCRITE..

65 2018-09-10 23:34:37 US stocks edged higher overnight, with the S&P500 & Nasdaq rebounding to snap a 4 day losing streak, although a drop in Apple kept gains in check. Ahead of the local open SPI futures are 1 point lower at 6,138. #stockmarket #ausshares

71 2018-09-10 23:31:36 In these entries, do you tend to wait until near EOD, as sometimes stocks go above previous day high intraday just to close below it and possibly carry on lower the following day? eg in those charts $QNST end of Aug

78 2018-09-10 23:26:29 Lol this convo isn’t able to be continued because ur creating a ownership you feel you have on/over players who play for an organization you support. They aren’t stocks, and your “investment” is in a team’s as a whole, not individual players.
79 2018-09-10 23:26:13 Depends how much you typically cook. I can get by cooking recipes that serve up to about 6 in my (5 or) 6qt, but planned to upgrade to 8qt because I make a lot of stocks and need bigger batches.

90 2018-09-10 23:21:26 You raised the stocks from a 19.8k to a very impressive 25.8k but guess what Obama's did he took it from 6.6 all the way to 19.8k now this area you can make alot of improvement and I hope you do but that doesn't make what Obama did not impressive or impactful to your advancements

94 2018-09-10 23:18:06 Remember in November the Companies that got the Tax Break brought back Company Stocks and Enriched Themselves!  It never was use for hiring employees!

104 2018-09-10 23:11:24 Man, I've got enough to buy a while 20 Apple Stocks, which really equals nothing in the scheme of things. Bank CD's are pretty low currently as well.
105 2018-09-10 23:11:00 Nike has gotten millions of dollars of free advertising because of all this. Yes, even you helped spread the word.  Sales and stocks are both up now. Nike thanks you.

Feel motivated to educate fellow ladies on the difference between an investor and a consumer. And how we can be both.

122 2018-09-10 22:54:55 Stu, I believe they hoard cash, crash the economy on purpose then buy stocks when they’re as low as they can get.  Then make out like the bandits they are on the recovery. I’ve seen it too many times. Democrats cleaning up their messes.

125 2018-09-10 22:53:24 True.  I never traded crypto for two reasons: too much hype and no options.    I can handle the hype, but not without options to allow me to maneuver when things go against me.  I think M.J. stocks will get traction as it opens up for medicinal use here in the U.S.
126 2018-09-10 22:52:14 "You need money to make money" truly applies to trading stocks!
127 2018-09-10 22:51:37 US stocks have mostly edged higher, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq rebounding to snap a four-day losing streak, although a drop in Apple kept gains in check.

129 2018-09-10 22:49:33 Well that's a pretty wide field. We are using 27.5 mln mt, market consensus seems to be somewhere around 33 mln mt and you've thrown 40 mln mt into the mix. Let's just hope you are wrong, or the Indian government will go bust subsidising sugar stocks.
130 2018-09-10 22:49:30 And my weed stocks have been among the biggest decliners since January, LG, TNY, CANN and sone others ive since sold off for losses. You've done great to pick some big winners. Its certainly not easy. Keep it up  :)
131 2018-09-10 22:49:20 Transportation stocks, JB Hunt, and CH Robinson both grew by over 3.5% today.
132 2018-09-10 22:48:43 Add it to the body count
133 2018-09-10 22:48:21 A man in Saudi Arabia has installed a fridge on the street and stocks it with free food for the homeless people in his neighborhood.
134 2018-09-10 22:47:35 Freight stocks surge on Wall Street: Werner +9%, Echo +7%. Saia +6%, XPO, Arcbest, Knight also up strong. 
Meanwhile, trucker Roadrunner Transportation -17.69%.
135 2018-09-10 22:46:21 It hit the $30 target, probably going to hold long term. The weed stocks I have I'm not so sold on long term, however.
136 2018-09-10 22:46:06 It’s $12BILLION to help them offset the loss tariffs charged by China on farm goods to counteract tariffs charged by Trump. You need to read the news.
137 2018-09-10 22:44:38 I was definitely wrong about feeling good about Chinese stocks.  When we get a bounce... short it.  People in China have been telling me that they notice things are slowing down.
138 2018-09-10 22:43:52 You sir, are soooooo immature Loved the way Nike's stocks are booming.
139 2018-09-10 22:42:13 The heavier handed the US is, the greater the response that is likely to come from China, and they have many options to crash US stocks. Then it's game over imo.
140 2018-09-10 22:41:25 Fucksticks like @incredibletrade love to pat themselves on the back for calls like $tsla and $amd but never let you know how that BTFD on stocks like $EA did. Why you such a pompous twat? Stocks go up 90% of the time you’re not incredible.
141 2018-09-10 22:40:12 If people were as hard on @GM, @Ford, @Chrysler, & others as the are on @Tesla, everyone would believe the automotive industry was in shambles.

Bonds, stocks, yields. Who cares? Tesla took cars into the 21st century and set a new standard that only it can meet.
Thanks @elonmusk
142 2018-09-10 22:39:40 Who knew that cannabis stocks would help pay my tuition
143 2018-09-10 22:39:39 I missed that one from before, I don’t fancy chasing it. I’ve been working on a scan for mid/large cap stocks using data analytics, so I don’t have try chase some of these smaller cap stocks.
144 2018-09-10 22:39:00 13 breakouts: $GNRC (gap), $XELA. Five sub-$1 stocks. Penny stock creep a concern after an extended period of quality buying.
145 2018-09-10 22:38:11 Good for them. Like I care about your opinion or their stocks. I simply stated a fact. Truth is hard to handle
146 2018-09-10 22:38:00 A man in Saudi Arabia has installed a fridge on the street and stocks it with free food for the homeless people in his neighborhood.
147 2018-09-10 22:36:46 What happen to all Dow stocks.  Seem like Gap and crap beside $DE
148 2018-09-10 22:36:41 That could be interesting. Denny, Kevin, and the rest that run for the win every week, have been winners in every division they raced...from Go-Karts through Street Stocks, Late Models, and into the top 3 divisions of NASCAR. Jeffery Earnhardt hasn't won anything, in anything.
149 2018-09-10 22:35:30 Found these #stocks that hit record highs: $PANW, $FTNT, $JKHY, $MTCH, $PAYC, $SNPS

151 2018-09-10 22:33:28 You don't see the potential conflict of interest with whistleblowers communicating with investors who bet against the stocks of companies. You don't see a problem with the associated spike in the puts and short interest. It would be inappropriate to ask you questions about MDXG.
152 2018-09-10 22:32:38 Buying back their own stocks doesn’t count
153 2018-09-10 22:32:27 The blocky-ness of the Siege bots.... feels odd. Cool, in some ways, and yet a little too retro in others. Didn't notice until the new stocks were out... 
154 2018-09-10 22:32:14 Too expensive and not much features. Buy Apple stocks everyone NOT APPLE PRODUCTS
155 2018-09-10 22:31:30 Well, then I guess they're idiots for not buying more stocks in the dip.
156 2018-09-10 22:29:47 Let me know what knowledge you glean from the research. I'd be interested. I always like getting back into stocks that did well for me in the past.
157 2018-09-10 22:29:40 @CityofKenner I told you on 
there would be protest to your
protest. The Kenner City Counsel
has been advocating for other
parishes to shop in River Town,
Restaurants, Shopping Centers
etc. I told you Nike took a gamble
and so far it's paying off. Stocks
are up for Nike.
158 2018-09-10 22:27:25 The parallel is the us stock market keeps going up as foreign CB can also print as much money as they want and buy our stocks. This is competitive devaluation hidden in inflated stock prices. And I’m no “doom guy”IMHO
159 2018-09-10 22:27:12 I know Baltimore has deteriorated under democrats dating back to the 60’s when pelosi’s crooked father was mayor.    I know my ira is up.   My stocks are up.    Unfortunately since obamacare my health insurance premium has skyrocketed.     These are realities I Do Know
160 2018-09-10 22:26:21 nope. no micro penny, or pot stocks.
161 2018-09-10 22:24:42 Although the Oval made a good attempt to drink the brewery dry, we still have stocks for our local clubs.
162 2018-09-10 22:24:38 Don't have numbers and doubt there are any in OS but indications are stocks are depleted. Bundeswehr will receive some refurbished ones they bought back from KMWEG who actually kept them in reserve for potential sales. They may or may not have some more hulls, but doubt its many.
163 2018-09-10 22:22:36 Man idk what it is

But something tells me that Ultimate is gonna be crackhead fast once the meta develops and that 3 stocks won’t be enough 

It’s a very strong feeling but idk why
164 2018-09-10 22:22:26 brb selling my seafood stocks
165 2018-09-10 22:20:57 @randy_aristotle I mean maybe ur a philosophical OG in stocks and options and I don’t see the posts but not once have you ever acknowledged
166 2018-09-10 22:20:55 Because the world isn’t JUST about the economy dumbass. 15% of America are invested in stocks.
167 2018-09-10 22:17:50 how to drop their stocks
168 2018-09-10 22:17:18 Stocks that are outperforming the market in general and the sector in particular tend to continue doing so over the next few months more often than not.
169 2018-09-10 22:15:18 $SPX +0.2%
Tariff watch continues
Emg Mkts still stressed
Brexit hopes lift
Hurricane Florence coming so
Construction stocks UP
Insurance stocks DOWN
Europe leads, EM lags
170 2018-09-10 22:15:16 Wall Street is so out of touch..but it makes for amazingly great value in quality disruptive-innovation stocks..
171 2018-09-10 22:15:12 thanks for reaching out. We're sorry to hear that you didn't receive any Little Shop minis with your recent shop. Unfortunately, Little Shop is only available while stocks last, and you're unable to collect these from a different location. We're sorry for the disappointment 1/2

175 2018-09-10 22:13:49 Like, if you plan on putting 30% in for the crazy % gains, I'd personally do 10% ,then other 20% in the actual video game stocks. More cushion(just in case), but still exposed. And I'm off.
176 2018-09-10 22:12:05 It is lol I only do swing trading (1-4wks) options and stocks. I can’t be in front of the computer too long, I’m no good at day trading lol
177 2018-09-10 22:11:35 Resulta imposible canjear cupones de @dodotpants en @caprabo !!Hay rotura de stocks, más previsión ,por favor!!!
178 2018-09-10 22:11:25 Today’s price swing on $eve was just a little taste on how quick undervalued stocks can move . Still extremely cheap while compared to peers by huge margin.
Gotta love the new 52 week high close. Don’t get shaken out on the intraday, this girl got lots of sexy left imo.
179 2018-09-10 22:11:25 I’m surprised a bank manager would be ‘doing weed stocks’ lmao that’s funny. $HUGE has a ton of momentum right now I’m on the track

181 2018-09-10 22:10:00 Imagine if that ratio chart breaks up thru 85     Gold stocks will@get crushed
182 2018-09-10 22:09:58 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
183 2018-09-10 22:09:10 Wondering if there’s a play in China stocks which have been beaten down by tariffs. Thinking of picking up JD which is close to 52 week low.
184 2018-09-10 22:08:19 Ps. Ripple or who ever dont have to tell jack shit to XRP holders about internal stuff, thats only with stocks(security), and XRP is not a security but just a digital asset! 
185 2018-09-10 22:07:46 $BZI.C is one of the most misunderstood companies around.   While people are out speculating on pot stocks there are other companies such as NameSilo who are drop by drop adding revenue daily.  Very boring but in this case boring is good.
186 2018-09-10 22:07:21 But they have been stronger on a relative basis. Also the GDX has been weaker than many of the pure gold mining stocks I follow. I think it has some miners with substantial copper mining.
187 2018-09-10 22:06:15 No one turned up last time, this time they’ll claim to have 52,000 screaming jawdees onboard, what a bunch of laughing stocks, keep it coming.
188 2018-09-10 22:04:17 Never follow Clay's bets. God awful. Stocks or football. Under Armour is tanking and Nike fully recovered its losses from last week.
189 2018-09-10 22:04:11 @jimcramer go eagles. What mad money every night. Ron asks what speculative pot stocks to buy. Not including Canopy, Cronos, Telray,
This Jim
190 2018-09-10 22:03:47 Charging a fee to buy guns wouldn't have prevented Las Vegas (Stephen Paddocks). The guns he had would buy me a car. So a fee wouldn't bother him. Banning military weapons sales, imports, bump stocks and giant clips would go a long way. Sawed off shotguns are illegal.
191 2018-09-10 22:02:31 The right stocks are gonna catch shorts offsides

194 2018-09-10 21:59:34 I snapped and now I’m investing in stocks and mass-cleaning my emails/deleting accounts all at once
195 2018-09-10 21:59:17 I can’t tweet anything anymore about stocks specifically because of my job, but best believe I am buying still... heavy
196 2018-09-10 21:58:51 Non-stop crypto coverage, now charting OTC weed stocks?  Wow.  Fast Money used to be worth watching about 10 years ago.  You guys need to get rid of everyone except Melissa and Guy.
197 2018-09-10 21:58:46 When a person is actively undermining a government while serving in a capacity where that person can cause a certain level of discord, if it is not sedition then what is it?
198 2018-09-10 21:57:47 The majority opinion of workers there is they do not want the union to come back, in large part because by law they would have to give up their stocks. Stock shorters and other enemies of Tesla (there are many, such as fossil fuel corps), prop up these anecdotal stories
199 2018-09-10 21:57:18 After the plant closed, Tesla bought it and rehired the majority of the workers who had lost their job, giving them better wages (living wages) and a generous benefits package with stocks.
200 2018-09-10 21:56:54 Do the letters QE and the phrase starting at depressed levels mean anything when it comes to stocks. As far as saving the auto industry, Ford is now shrinking its Norrh America operations.
201 2018-09-10 21:56:13 you mean selling and buying stocks that already had hot runs lol lots of money to be made there!
202 2018-09-10 21:55:26 Stocks and shares time! Traded out of WANDisco as I have no faith in the Azure plaform and the RNS delivery is somewhat lacking, Now am targeting AI investments & carbon capture.  Also toured a mineral mine and researched Ruby mining for additional high risk/ gain invedtments.

207 2018-09-10 21:51:43 لا هنت

والهدف نزولا كم ؟
208 2018-09-10 21:51:22 VERY loudly and in the Public Square. Stocks and pillory like...
209 2018-09-10 21:51:06 No, they dont! And why would we need to know! It has been settled! We are XRP holders, we dont hold Ripple stocks! Lawsuit is gone! Its what we need!
210 2018-09-10 21:50:27 We have a theme (weed), otc stocks are actually worth scanning over again, and I’m seeing a more multi day runners for big board
211 2018-09-10 21:49:07 Nike’s online sales jumped 31% after company unveiled Kaepernick campaign, data show. We are all  happy for NIKE. Standing with the oppressed, against injustice and police brutality against blacks .We all pray your stocks keep rising .Call for  boycotts: hypocritical
212 2018-09-10 21:48:58 As an investor, I guess he's long marijuana stocks.  Smoking is unhealthy though.
213 2018-09-10 21:48:12 wow excellent so there is no losses all ways winning, it could be great if you could add losses also. I took one month subscription and I don't see here all the stocks what you suggested during that month.I think this file has winning stocks. can you.
214 2018-09-10 21:46:46 1) It's 1.2B, not 12B.
2) We subsidize farmers to NOT grow certain crops.

I prefer free trade. 0% tariffs. If you paid attention to Trump instead of Marx, his goal is to get to 0%. That's free trade. Cheers.
215 2018-09-10 21:46:27 Inside the US he’s laughing stocks as well
216 2018-09-10 21:45:34 @timseymour why you pumping cheap ass weed stocks like $ogrmf. You say cause they haven’t moved up much. Shame on your ass and @CNBC
217 2018-09-10 21:45:08 But it’s still amazing that they will load up on more stocks to pump the stockprice?
They should see the writing on the wall in difference to retail muppets.
218 2018-09-10 21:44:57 Yes. What laughing stocks they are. The dumbest!
219 2018-09-10 21:44:55 I'm finally taking the time to learn how to deal with stocks.
220 2018-09-10 21:43:45 the pinned tweet has me ded 
221 2018-09-10 21:43:34 $hmny does dirt trader ever chart any REAL stocks or just penny stocks ?   Guy is duch a shill
222 2018-09-10 21:43:24 You're darn tootin', in my home at least!  You'd be in the stocks
223 2018-09-10 21:42:49 I plan to buy a limit order starter position in #Organigram, $OGRMF in the am while it's still under $6... Pot stocks are the future.
224 2018-09-10 21:42:42 $APHQF .. Apria , looks under valued than some other weed stocks and has not run up a lot YTD. Could be time to load this.
225 2018-09-10 21:42:27 Let’s buy Tesla stocks rn while they’re low
226 2018-09-10 21:42:26 Extremely disappointing, not to mention infuriating, to listen to an ignorant fisherman being given an unchallenged platform to spout complete nonsense about seals being to blame for depleted salmon stocks in and around Morecambe Bay @BBCNWT
227 2018-09-10 21:41:10 U.S. stocks mostly edged higher Monday,with the S&P 500 & Nasdaq rebounding to snap a 4-day losing streak,although a drop in Apple kept gains in check.
228 2018-09-10 21:40:49 We'll just have to unconfirm him and put those who voted to do it in stocks.
229 2018-09-10 21:40:43 One month ago it was 82.71. Quit with the fake nonsense. Everyone that understands stocks knows that it dipped bc if the news and people bought low. It was always going to come back up
230 2018-09-10 21:40:11 There should be trusting from consumers to be investing debentures, bonds, securities, stocks, etc with the banking industries, in which investment first would you like to be explaining; take a deep breath; heh heh
231 2018-09-10 21:39:36 If they're actually antimicrobial.... I'm going to buying more $CROX tomorrow. Stocks currently killing it! My feet sweat like a MFer and this could be a game changer around the house because we all wear slippers cuz my room mates are Chinese lol.
232 2018-09-10 21:37:49 Because his taxes are hidden we don’t know if other countries have compromised him. Could be the Russians have invested so much in Trump, inc that they control him. For example Trump increased defense spending. Is he personally invested in defense stocks?
233 2018-09-10 21:37:34 Buy some stock and you'll be one of them. 
Smart responsible people invest in stocks for retirement, not envy.
234 2018-09-10 21:37:25 Only pot stocks are tangible and bitcoin is trying to make blockchain into a currency.
235 2018-09-10 21:37:20 HODL is for crypto not stocks

246 2018-09-10 21:32:01 Notice it said "Ham". If they got rid of "Bacon" they might as well sell all there stocks and be done with food service.
247 2018-09-10 21:31:54 Just seeing if you wanted to look over some stocks with me. And perhaps also look into the housing markets.
248 2018-09-10 21:31:44 I just had to

250 2018-09-10 21:31:23 I can tell ya what will happen, he says they win the trade, stocks the "grade A" prospect cupboard and they will compete and make the playoffs every year" like he says all the time
251 2018-09-10 21:30:53 Learn a language or instrument, and also teach me about stocks after you get rich
252 2018-09-10 21:29:59 Nike stocks almost peaking after Kaepernick Ad. They might’ve lost a percentage of white audience, but they definitely gained a whole new audience. Good moves, good moves Nike. 
253 2018-09-10 21:29:25 But buying a book is not important as reading it. A lot of people stocks books but rarely read.
254 2018-09-10 21:28:56 Nope you could still by ARs and any other EBR the entire time. It was a cosmetic ban and nothing more. 

No flash hiders or folding stocks or bayonet lugs. 

But feel feee to tell me how it worked.
255 2018-09-10 21:28:46 Time to sell #PotStocks as @CNBC is talking about more upside. Only thing more solid would be Gartman being a “net buyer in crypto dollar terms of the pot stocks!”
256 2018-09-10 21:28:44 That said, new tech stocks are usually quite volatile and is why day traders target them.
257 2018-09-10 21:28:31 Look, the one thing we won’t stand for in this country is hurting children, ok! Unless you’re Roman Polanski or the NRA or Woody Allen or Penn State Football or the US Government or Kevin Spacey or ICE or the makers of bump stocks or a police officer breaking up a pool party or
258 2018-09-10 21:26:04 Looks like these low priced .30-.50 stocks are the latest craze

NLST started the pumps and now AGRX taking off after hours
259 2018-09-10 21:24:53 90% of stocks n bonds r owned by top 10%.

So 300 million people share the remaining 10% 

Ur right @ChuckMcKenna

All of us in the #RESISTANCE r liberal elites...

Swimming in the riches of r retirement funds.  We r offended u think we have 401ks,  implies we work 4 a living!
260 2018-09-10 21:24:10 Every chemical used as a weapon is considered to be a chemical weapon under the CWC, AFAIK. Its stockpile isn't banned because unlike nerve agents, it's not single-use - chlorine theoretically has industrial applications. When Assad acceeded in 2013, he dismantled banned stocks.

264 2018-09-10 21:19:33 How about the market and 401k, my stocks, my value in general. Under Obama, he was the one making money, mine portfolio was stagnant. Ok?
265 2018-09-10 21:17:26 Norman Osborne created a company that would become the sole provider of weapons to the US military, resulting in low costs, high revenue, and highest stocks ever. Not to mention, how much he sacrificed. And he was still ousted as CEO of the company.
266 2018-09-10 21:17:15 Yes but as you say its use as a weapon is proscribed by the very treat to which Syria acceded to, erm, remove its stocks of chemical weapons.

271 2018-09-10 21:15:19 Your party reduced revenues, in the form of tax cuts, which increased the debt. Now we find companies buying back stocks, with the tax savings, at a record rate, and wages with the exception of CEO pay are stagnant. Thanks to your party, GOP, and its policies.

276 2018-09-10 21:09:51 I’ve read this several times now: “I feel it in the air.” - is that a phrase @FoxNews is using to describe how ‘great’ the economy is? The rich are doing better (stocks up, huge tax cut if you make $500+k), but all most of the rest of us ‘feel’ are stagnant wages & rising costs.

No realistic way to prevent all Vegas type events but banning bump stocks would dramatically reduce casualties
280 2018-09-10 21:07:09 No, my business flatlined during the 8 years of Obama mostly due to over regulation and international business attitude. 
Once Trump arrived, we have experienced a 430% growth in sales with much higher profits then the previous period. Tax cuts were a major bump as were stocks.
281 2018-09-10 21:06:56 So you Trump supporters, what exactly happened now after burning Nike gear?

Nike had 17% more sold. Nike 1:0 Trumpsters

Nike stocks go up. Nike 2:0 Trumpsters

You Trumpsters should stop making America a joke. Stop following a treasonous dumb selfish President.
282 2018-09-10 21:04:37 looks like Trump will wait a bit to implement new wave of tariff. at least till chinese stocks will bounce. Now US modestly green and china deep red is too favorable to break

310 2018-09-10 20:58:50 Shouldn't it be illegal for the "President" to comment on a companies selling or not selling a product? You could cause stocks to fall which would hurt innocent Americans. Shameful Trump! And this is an American company. Trump tries to kill stocks?
311 2018-09-10 20:58:30 Picked up some $tsla at $273.2 this morning. Usually don't trade stocks but I've had good trades on tesla before and opportunity is opportunity

318 2018-09-10 20:52:37 Historically, it's when everyone is determining the market looks like hell that things turn around. Is there the possibility of a greater dip? Absolutely, and it probably will happen, but is it as risky as buying traditional stocks in the longest running bull market in history?

Now my imaginary portfolio is showing healthy gains. My real portfolio looks tattered.
321 2018-09-10 20:47:01 Just some food for thought with regards to the EM sell off:

$EEM MSCI EM: PE 12.65, PB 1.61
$CNYA China A Shares: PE 12.6, PB 1.6

More tariffs and rate hikes still a strong possibility.

326 2018-09-10 20:45:27 Don't we do the same thing with Real Estate?  Lot's of investments have a cost basis associated with them.

366 2018-09-10 20:26:23 Sure a 4 day week can be done. As long as youre willing to give up a massive part of stuff.

384 2018-09-10 20:12:52 World stocks ex Asia jog higher: Europe +.5%; US +.2%. Good economic news outweighed trade tensions for today. Don’t count on this regularly repeating in the short-term. Expect a volatility spike soon caused by either trade issues or political dysfunction. Short-term cash is king
385 2018-09-10 20:12:47 I think it should be 
15% BTC / 
15% ALTS 
10% ICO 
10% IPO 
25% Stocks 
15% Gold/Silver 
10% FIAT
Then long Term investments of Land with any earnings

388 2018-09-10 20:12:02 I smoke weed  and I’m down with @elonmusk @Tesla stocks are all good with me 
389 2018-09-10 20:12:02 These weed stocks still have a ton of momentum when you look at the big picture. So many want them to die and they’re still consolidating in these upper ranges hinting towards another leg higher.
390 2018-09-10 20:10:43 Yes because fixing an economy as bad at the Great Depression is a quick fix. Slow and steady produced real results. As you can see with the current economy. Stocks r up, as they should be due to Corp tax cuts
391 2018-09-10 20:10:07 If you are active in stocks you can see the movement since Krugman famous statement of predicting depression with Trump.
392 2018-09-10 20:10:06 It's like most of Wall Street was going, "Wait for the bigots to dump their stocks, aaaaaaand YOINK!"
393 2018-09-10 20:09:43 The people that sold Tesla stocks because @elonmusk took one hit of a blunt on a podcast in his free time are idiots lol watch the podcast and realize how much smarter he is than 99.9% of the world
394 2018-09-10 20:08:59 YOU BIIIITCH HOW R WE SUPPOSED TO START WAREHOUSE WITH A TOTAL OF 99 STOCKS ur so fuckin selfishhh!!!!!!
395 2018-09-10 20:07:48 Stocks rally modestly but broadly after last week's pullback. Nasdaq +0.3%, S&P +0.2%, Russell 2000 +0.2%.

Dow -0.2%, -58 to 25,858 on weakness in a few stocks.

Dow transports +1.8% to record high on econ optimism.

400 2018-09-10 20:03:55 It means the "market" of US Stocks is a farce, a rigged system.  It means that US corporations were permitted to repatriate cumulative years of tax avoidance kept overseas and enabled them to "bail out" their stock performance.

426 2018-09-10 19:52:11 Not really...some are...but many automatic weapons are still allowed.
But things like bump stocks need to be illegal.
427 2018-09-10 19:52:06 These pots stocks are hot.  Option premiums too high for me.  Maybe play a call spread over 3-6 months.  No positions.
428 2018-09-10 19:51:44 What would they use as collateral ? Stocks ?

What about that dividend you got to lower your average.U getting the 30 stocks you have mixed up? Right? LOL, you are hilarious. Can't keep it straight
438 2018-09-10 19:46:32 Ok have I missed something? Whatdoes Musk smoking weed during a podcast have to do w/Tesla business? Why are stocks dropping? Has he done worse than Trump? ...because he got elected to POTUS. Help me here.
439 2018-09-10 19:45:39 Does it seem far-fetched and inconceivable to envision a future in which tech stocks fall and commodities (i.e. real stuff) rise and perhaps even outperform?

Certainly feels like delusional thinking atm...
440 2018-09-10 19:45:36 2/3 of the increase in capex (capital investments) comes from just 10 companies. Plus, capital investments are only concentrated in a few sectors and stocks. That's why its a mistake to use capex as a broad trend.
441 2018-09-10 19:45:23 OS in this correction which stocks would you say are good for long-term?
I will really appreciate your opinion.

449 2018-09-10 19:42:02 Except younger folks aren’t buying stocks. The reality no one wants to admit is possible is the country is not as divided and falling apart as either side wants us to believe. Truth is typically not with the outliers.

462 2018-09-10 19:33:02 ..........cut taxes to fuel a very last squeeze, while further limiting future options to help absorb a shock.  Now we sit here, with debt as high as it's ever been, stocks and asset prices as high as they've ever been, interest rates as low as they've ever been, and no solution
463 2018-09-10 19:32:09 politicians voted to put a band aide on the whole thing, by taking out an unprecedented level of debt, doubling it, and then handed the money out.  Boosted stocks for the short run, and put money in the pockets of the wealthy who really needed it the least, went 0% interest rates
464 2018-09-10 19:31:33 What do you mean it's literally at one of its best points in history!!! Lowest unemployment since 2000, GDP growth at 4.1%, stocks skyrocketing, and companies are expanding.  PLEASE show me where the economy is still "damaged"

518 2018-09-10 19:07:50 If Yu trade stocks on vacation, are Yu really on vacation ?
519 2018-09-10 19:06:33 Nah.  Stocks react minute to minute based on news, general market/economic/global conditions etc.  When a stock loses billions in one fell swoop on ONE item, that is the cause.  If it recovers over the course of a week it is reacting to all of the ensuing news/outlook.

540 2018-09-10 18:56:14 #3 stocks and shares can become worth nothing if the business goes bankrupt.  Shares can be brought back and businesses can issue more shares.

545 2018-09-10 18:53:56 The only reason companies had their expectations up is because they bought the tax cuts through their donations! They bought up all their stocks,  gave a bonus to some and still stagnant wages while prices go up the deficit didn't go up a little 1.5 trillion is NOT a little!
546 2018-09-10 18:53:48 Any upside in September should be really led by the materials, energy and industrial sectors, and the defensive sectors such as healthcare, staples and utilities can tag along. Growth stocks in technology and retail spending are likely to under perform due to tariffs. $SPX

558 2018-09-10 18:47:41 I constantly see so many people blame the amount of capital they have to work with for not making money.

It is MUCH harder to get in and out of stocks with a huge amount of cash. If you struggle to be profitable with $10K, being handed $100M is not the solution...

564 2018-09-10 18:45:10 Yea I get that, but when the uranium price is going up and all these junior U mining stocks are going up at the same time (where most aren’t producing and have questionable deposits) you can’t help but wonder why the biggest cashed up miner ain’t doing the same thing.

568 2018-09-10 18:42:41 Actually monthly job growth has slowed considerably under Trump, stocks are down this year, the Labor Participation Rate is still unchanged & consumer prices are up. But CT has lagged due to high cost of living, failing to invest in transportation and affordable housing.

618 2018-09-10 18:13:44 stocks rise by 1%.
619 2018-09-10 18:12:12 That’s what happens (temporarily) when you flood businesses and the wealthy with tax breaks so they can buy their stocks back and give higher dividends to other wealthy people. Gee, how ya gonna pay for all that debt you created?  Cutting federal workers pay and ???  Idiots.

783 2018-09-10 16:50:50 crypto's are anti wallstreet/banker,,, stocks claiming to represent crypto are like you going to a strip bar and being happy to see a guy posing as a woman. they are drag queens.
784 2018-09-10 16:50:48 They should only buy stocks when they are right at the bottom otherwise it just wouldn't make any sense
785 2018-09-10 16:50:47 Actually, lagi talagang Kremil-S ang iniinom ko at hindi ako nawawalan ng stocks..

Thank you!
786 2018-09-10 16:49:57 @Nike takes my money all the time anyway. Might as well cop a few stocks..nice doing business with y’all. Lol
787 2018-09-10 16:48:03 Traded stocks in the late eighties while i was starting business school
788 2018-09-10 16:47:00 Well I will try when stocks are low & there's a free parking space. 
789 2018-09-10 16:46:58 Why comment on a stock if you have no interest in the stock in the 1st place? Lol ppl commenting on #UKOG being overvalued do so to ramp up other stocks. Those negative about it are shorting. Otherwise why waste your time & energy on something that doesn't affect you financially?

796 2018-09-10 16:43:14 European shares climbed on Monday thanks to a relief rally in Italian stocks and banks after comments from Italy's finance minister eased concerns about his government's spending plans.

There has to be solid social safety net, not raw capitalism.
Am content, retired now. Worked 48yrs. 2 jobs (15yrs ea) replaced w/ temp workers becuz CEO pay is tied to stocks & mass lay-offs raise stock values.
Dealt bad hands, or stacked deck?
799 2018-09-10 16:42:07 If Hillary was in the White House,Charoltteville would never happen,bump stocks would be banned,the number of legal gun owners would not threaten the Press.AND PUERTO RICO WOULD BE 100% REBUILT!
800 2018-09-10 16:42:06 Agree, BOJ + SNB essentially buying US stocks already...

Terrible....  and it hasn’t been capitalism for over a decade....
803 2018-09-10 16:40:54 Stocks are generally up, what, 80-100% (!!) since 2013, so that $1.75M->$1.2M feels like even a bigger slide.

810 2018-09-10 16:37:55 I don’t believe that markets will crash with a Trump exit, what comes afterwards is crucial. If stocks are overinflated and don’t reflect the company/economy/real(not borrowed) buying power, markets bubble and can crash. Removing DJT might only realign markets and expectations
811 2018-09-10 16:37:32 Great idea  - Create digital money out of thin air and use it to buy stocks in whatever quantity needed to keep the "markets stable" or the bubble inflated. Translation: We need to restrain the market to adjust to fair value (which is its main function)

816 2018-09-10 16:35:22 Have I already missed the chance to short a bunch of reinsurer's stocks?
817 2018-09-10 16:34:01 Just goes to show that stocks have no direct relationship to purchasing but has a direct correlation to the nervousness of the investors who thought the stock would tank quickly.

828 2018-09-10 16:31:47 STOCKS TO WATCH: Fresh shorts were seen being added in stocks like Yes Bank, Adani Enterprises, L&TFH, State Bank of India, Tata Global, Bharti Airtel, Vedanta, Federal Bank, Sun Pharma And ITC.
829 2018-09-10 16:31:15 Been watching those Chi-x orders of 101 push the SP up n down for the past few days. There mustn't be many stop loss'es no more. Chi-x sells down a pip (101) then ASX platform buys up a pip by (101). When illiquid stocks are in demand, games get played to get th impatient 2 sell.
830 2018-09-10 16:30:56 Motely fools are crook and shorting stocks...
831 2018-09-10 16:30:28 YES. I hate when people talk about a players draft position like it matters. Their stocks start changing again the first time they pick up a stick again post draft. It is a great indicator of past potential but means very little now.

843 2018-09-10 16:24:23 @Stockengg just confused a bit by one post in the group. VWAP strategy - can it be used for intra-day trading for stocks? Or is it more successful for indices only?
844 2018-09-10 16:21:40 Interesting, tweet me back when you get > 10 m though ;). Definitely some lessons for us in your paper as we're trying to figure out C stocks and interpolate readings.
845 2018-09-10 16:21:30 See how much bonds suck? FED gonna buy stocks in the next crisis!

847 2018-09-10 16:21:15 Yes I still hold $BGS but sold down significantly to reduce cost basis.

Still believe in the story so content to hold the rest longer-term until sentiment in lithium stocks reverses.

850 2018-09-10 16:19:38 Do you really need me to answer your question? People who bet against stocks are on the internet spreading negative rumors about companies every single day. Did the SEC investigate any of the cases you mentioned as short and distort (inverse) scams? No.
851 2018-09-10 16:19:28 I wonder if sell Rosh Hashanah buy Yom Kippur applies to the Cannabis stocks? No response necessary just a tongue and cheek comment
852 2018-09-10 16:19:25 Would make sense if it becomes a safe haven when stocks correct. Doesn’t feel like capitulation yet though, so could be short term.

887 2018-09-10 16:02:49 Yeah. They will do so around the festive season. That's a good reason to give discounts and clear the stocks
888 2018-09-10 16:02:06 You are insane. Unemployment was 9.4 in 2008. 4.6 when obama left. Stocks were 8000 in 2008 and 19000 dec 2016.  Trump is riding the momentum until trade war hits hard

957 2018-09-10 15:30:32 @realDonaldTrump the 1% got what they wanted. I don’t have stocks and I haven’t seen an increase in my paycheck nor my bank account. I do see prices rising, therefore the cost of living is rising. As that happens the 98% become more poor. You are a #LiarInChief #Disgusting

1036 2018-09-10 14:58:13 Booming economy: is the stocks-market!
Sadly when it was booming during Obama, R’s said: the middle class didn’t feels the booming of the market, also, the stocks, the unemployment numbers were irrelevant!
NOW: Wow , it’s a miracle....
1037 2018-09-10 14:57:52 IMHO the EV change is not a fad, it’s a necessity. As you highlighted fossil fuel stocks are falling, never to be replenished. Air quality is appalling, getting worse, 1000’s dying every year due to it. 1000’s more suffering from life changing/limiting breathing difficulties

1066 2018-09-10 14:47:37 GDP and Wall Street are doing great.  However, fewer people are now in stocks than were 2 years ago, and the GDP growth has mostly been at the top.  You made the rich richer... so what your saying is mostly true.  However, it'll NEVER "trickle down".  That's why you're a fraud.

1070 2018-09-10 14:45:47 The economy is blowing me away right now, Mr. President. Sir, this is fantastic for us folks that are just starting out. I am putting a lot of my earnings aside in real estate for the long term as well as some Bearish stocks. However, this bullish market is a dream come true!!!
1071 2018-09-10 14:45:01 I like  Mondays, I get intimate with my stocks. This is the only way you have a chance with these stocks become a specialist and master over 2-3 names. When you go into the professional world you’ll realize they have an edge because they’re world is so small.
1072 2018-09-10 14:44:16 But again, only bother with that if you aren't playing the long game. I've been tempted into trying to play the stocks daily and while theoeycrafting is fun, I've been wrong a lot and lost money because of it. I need to learn to just put in money and let it sit and grow

1074 2018-09-10 14:42:13 main impetus driving stocks higher is Trump giving huge tax break to corporations, yes great for balance sheets, but what bout balance sheet of USA lot less money flowing into treasury, just so the rich can get richer, meanwhile lower quality consumer default rate on loans high
1075 2018-09-10 14:42:11 For example, all my stocks are in video game companies and I've learned that stocks raise about a week BEFORE a big game releases or is announced and go back to normal shortly. I've missed several opportunities because of it but now I know

1082 2018-09-10 14:38:52 The best way to use the stock market imo is for the long haul. I find safe stocks and treat it like a savings account. A reliable company will slowly raise over time and always recover from dips, even if it takes two or three months to do so

1086 2018-09-10 14:37:12 That crypto traders use made up terms to describe things that immediately outs them as being new to trading. “Sell and buy walls” “pump” “dump”. The last two are used in penny stocks but not to describe price action, haha.

1100 2018-09-10 14:31:07 Are stocks rising on hopes of another tax cut?  The cuts will never happen. If they did, the twin deficits would grow even larger. More bad trade policy to follow.  Short term thinking. Someone will make a buck by trading, but not most of us.

1406 2018-09-10 12:04:30 Someone said Fenati should be flogged. I think paddock medieval-style stocks could be an idea: don’t stick naughty riders on the back of the grid, throw rotten hospitality tomatoes at them

1459 2018-09-10 11:23:36 I'm open to correction but the funds offered by Miller's company make 'long' investments in companies: so they invest positively in stocks long term.
Hedge funds, on the other hand, often use short-term 'short' markets which make money by finding losers. I don't think she hedges.

1506 2018-09-10 10:45:42 It's easy to see the cycle of any asset, but human nature makes it hard for most investors, especially retail investors, to benefit from it, since most investors only remember stocks that have done well recently.

1536 2018-09-10 10:21:10  the best strategy for traders i must say... and even after 10 trades one is on losing side he/she must be picking wrong stocks and not checking daily chart and primary trend of the stock. I am huge fan of squeeze BO strategy. In trending market it makes killling.

1668 2018-09-10 08:04:57 Nice mock conversation. But wonder what is the valuable message. During rupee depreciation there are more foreign fund outflows which means it doesn't evince interest among FIIs. Investor is still having great time if stocks go up

1676 2018-09-10 07:57:29 Yes, bug PEG is not a bulletproof measure, I'd be broke if I used ratios, mind you I don't panic when stocks drop, I buy more whenever I have spare cash, I think about next 2-3 years not next 3 months. $CSL is one of a kind, massive pricing power, rare product, massive moat

1916 2018-09-10 03:59:00 Bi-annual raises the first 2 years is actually part of the standard compensation package for FT associates.  Plus we get monthly bonuses and company stocks.  We're not "desperate" for people, but we do ramp up for the busy seasons.

1920 2018-09-10 03:57:21 Ok - looked at “article” - full of multiple biases and in the end - u and I as lowly Radiologists/entrepreneurs- what can we do with this info - I can’t know all the factors for every company to use this as a way to decide which stocks to invest in 1/?
1921 2018-09-10 03:57:16 How many people have to work more than one job because they are not living wage jobs? How many people can't even afford stocks so they could participate in this great economy? I know I can't.

1923 2018-09-10 03:56:43 Obama assumes people can’t tell the difference in unemployment, jobs, payrolls, benefits, 401ks, stocks etc in past 2 years!  The only credit he gets is for leaving.
1924 2018-09-10 03:56:11 Stocks are driven by sales. So stupid
1925 2018-09-10 03:55:40 Hi Sagar..Jhunjhunwala made money in stocks  by simply sitting on his bets ! Very few stocks gave huge returns for him...
1926 2018-09-10 03:54:24 People like to credit “stocks” to reinforce their biases, opinions or ideas.

Nike stock took a dive, Tesla took a dive. But so did a lot of other stocks.

What makes stock talk sexy but not substantive compared to other type of money talk?
1927 2018-09-10 03:53:03 I haven't followed the $ALL story close enough to comment, but similar to the ASX listed tech stocks I have been tracking $XRO, $NEA, $APT, $ALU, $APX, $WTC these stocks all have had phenomenal runs, hence my confidence in initiating short positions.
1928 2018-09-10 03:52:27 Everyone seems to get that but you. Thus leading you to look like a moron in a public forum. Embarrassing huh?

Don’t tweet about market values and stocks if you know just as much as a newborn. Not a good look.

1946 2018-09-10 03:32:19 The point is that even if the known stocks were destroyed in 91 or whenever it was, it could still be produced  in a clandestine program. It can be disguised as a pesticide product.

1948 2018-09-10 03:31:16 Indexing is a wonderful secondary savings tool (alongside an employer-sponsored retirement plan). Managing an ETF portfolio isn’t about frequent trading— a lesson a lot of passive investors need to learn.  Just like with stocks, you’ll lose majority of gains from trans. costs

1965 2018-09-10 03:19:49 STOs are pretty much preferred stocks packaged with different rights. Some are convertible to utility tokens at a later date, but that really is no different than a convertible debt agreement. Main advantage would be liquidity for investors if exchanges open to trade STOs.

1973 2018-09-10 03:14:46 Ignore ALL 5 years CAGR returns for the next 1 year at least.

2008 2018-09-10 02:53:47 What I think is fascinating is that everyone stocks up on bottled water in times like this, including me. The more sustainable thing to do would be to fill gallon size bags with water and keep in bathtub, but I almost never hear anyone suggest that.

2050 2018-09-10 02:23:19 We also spoke about metal stocks likely to do well as weak ruppee would check imports/dumping. As per TV channels government is likely to impose an anti dumping duty of Rs 185/tone on steel/long products. Big positive for steel companies.

2056 2018-09-10 02:16:31 IMO ASX tech stocks are trading at huge valuations, and not justifiable.

$XRO - stalking it for a short, just filled the gap left behind on 5 Sep. Volumes average so far, but past few red days have been on big volume. This was trading at $24 a yr ago, and they are bleeding cash
2057 2018-09-10 02:16:19 No problem Rich. It happened in about the same sequence last time. Stocks will lag the U price....they always do....and that is good for us. We are seeing a solid sustained uptrend in U spot price. That gets the interest of commodities speculators.Then the big funds move in &BOOM

“For the vast majority of Americans, fluctuations in the stock market have relatively little effect on their wealth, or well-being, for that matter,” said Edward N. Wolff, an economist at NYU.

U.S.  stocks fell for a fourth straight days after President Donald Trump’s  threat to escalate the trade war with China roiled technology and  multinational shares.The yield on 10-year Treasuries held at 2.94 percent after advancing seven basis points.
2060 2018-09-10 02:15:37 Asian stocks were off to a muted start Monday as investors digested  President Donald Trump’s threat to escalate the trade war with China.
Benchmarks  were little changed in Japan, Australia and South Korea while futures  indicated losses for equities in China and Hong Kong.

1. Have a huge disparity between their image of themselves, and what they can ACTUALLY DO. 
2. Live on Bluffs: Don't own stocks, but boast of them. 
3. REFUSAL to update their informational uptake. 
4. Get infor from a buddy at a bar.

2087 2018-09-10 01:53:11 CBS isn't gonna die because Moonves is gone. Again---these men/women are replaceable. They are. And CBS stocks went up at the end of last week. Having closure regarding the Redstone/Moonves power struggle will help CBS' stock. Expect CBS stock to open up positively tomorrow.
2088 2018-09-10 01:53:07 Mining stocks ALWAYS FADE or crash and burn. So why the ffff would anyone want to bother chasing these stocks up to the moon at record high price/valuation?

Oh wait I forgot ppl love to buy high and that thing called FOMO.

Tips on the Rosa MU:
-Escpe pressure with up b
-Dont play offensive until you kill luma
-Use fludd to keep her on disadvantage and claim stage control
-Use cape offstage for free stocks
-Upsmash and back air are safe and can add potential damage to luma

2097 2018-09-10 01:46:02 Poll: What do you do if/when one of your stocks drops 20%.
2098 2018-09-10 01:45:49 I agree but we've been saying that for weeks. Chinese stocks are all clobbered from their highs. If flow comes in these could reverse hard and fast.
2099 2018-09-10 01:44:50 be a big positive for domestic manufacturers. However even now imports are substantially down due to a weak ruppee as imports become expensive. At the same time exports have become that much more profitable. Domestic demand remains strong. All in all good times for paper stocks.

2102 2018-09-10 01:43:46 Democrats 2016:
If @realDonaldTrump wins the economy is going to crash, stocks market will lose 5000 points in 1st week. 
Democrats 2018:
The economy is doing good thanks to Obama.
2103 2018-09-10 01:43:27 But, but the $2,500 savings that we were promised by Obamacare would really help.  You remember that healthcare plan that the Democrats gave us.  And now you think you have the answer?  Why not return all the money you got from your your healthcare stocks and offshore funds?
2104 2018-09-10 01:41:30 Wow just like Nike stocks and orders. All Nike and the nfl have done is keeping more and more even though you delusionally think they aren’t. You can even as foxnews.

2114 2018-09-10 01:30:36 Great point. Trump has already said he wants the government to pay for everyone's healthcare, has used his pen and phone to ban bump stocks, called for gun confiscation w/o due process and is raising taxes w/o Congress. Trumpers don't care about most policy

2137 2018-09-10 01:02:17 The wage increase that just happened is undoubtedly for CEO's who have been enjoying buying up stocks w/ their tax cut for the rich. For those of us who have never had enough money to invest in the market there is little hope of becoming rich. Rich get richer...

2139 2018-09-10 01:01:14 Heck, even short-term Treasury notes now yield more than the SPX. What makes you think foreign money would panic buy US stocks at sky-high valuations with deteriorating fundamentals? Didn't happen in 2015/6 when EM was falling apart.

2147 2018-09-10 00:53:59 This is exactly what I did. Only I bought stocks directly (not funds) and diversified. Re-invested dividends. It grew quickly, retired early and now live on dividends. I never touch the principal
2148 2018-09-10 00:52:35 Can you smell ASX pot stocks? 
2149 2018-09-10 00:51:16 yes, that's right. and those stocks are rarely singular.
