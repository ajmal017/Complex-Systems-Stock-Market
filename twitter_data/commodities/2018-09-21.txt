32 2018-09-23 20:47:41 Sure. If you limit yourself to the most common historical take on extractives in Africa - as most white (and some non-white) people do. Thankfully, I don’t limit myself to such prisms. If I did, I’d view Africans as commodities, as did the Europeans who enslave my ancestors.
33 2018-09-23 20:29:01 Jeffrey was used to giving up things and commodities to those who needed it more. Therefore, he'd prioritized Bismarck's well-being. While Bismarck had received the privileges of relief from heat, Jeffrey was suffering horribly. Still, he did his best not to show it.
34 2018-09-23 20:15:53 Thank you for sharing these. More evidence of how man-centered culture means women’s appearance, bodies, choices, & worth are valued as commodities. Always someone waiting to put us in our place.

39 2018-09-23 19:43:14 I watched Black Panther. Strangely, the Afro-futurist world building that people really latched on to left me cold. Like, oh wow, a commodities based economy run by a monarchy dependent on tribal loyalties, really breaking the mold on what an African country can be there Marvel.
40 2018-09-23 19:41:55 “It becomes plain that it is not the exchange of commodities which regulates the magnitude of their values, but rather the reverse, the magnitude of the value of commodities which regulates the proportion in which they exchange.” Marx, Capital
41 2018-09-23 19:39:09 Lastly, I think that's a strange self-concept to have.  It's something put upon us.  "a better world is possible", etc.   But we really internalize *that* identity, we're internalizing what is put upon us which is basically that we are commodities.</>

12 months - #SOLG - a good year coming for this one. Pick your entry but it goes much higher as copper rebounds & the co transforms.

24 months - #IRR - multiple provinces multiple commodities.

58 2018-09-23 17:57:28 The 8th Amendment makes health care a constitutional mandate for incarcerated ppl.

59 2018-09-23 17:56:43 La metáfora de caminar y mascar chicle a la vez es reduccionista con los “córnershop”. Caminar, algo natural, sería la economía de los commodities. En cambio mascar chicle, lo efímero y opcional, serían estos nuevos emprendimientos. 

Quizás ese sea el core business del debate.
60 2018-09-23 17:45:56 The Chinese excessive investment in commodities such as steel and aluminum created such a massive bubble in 2000s that ended up crashing many of the industries and shutting down more than half of China's steel industry when busted
61 2018-09-23 17:43:32 No one is saying 19th. Century, as Steel and Aluminum are still important commodities. The main thing is, the industrial jobs are mostly blue collar and union, high paying. That helps elevate wages, by having more high paying jobs out there.
62 2018-09-23 17:31:20 Y, para países productores de commodities como nosotros, quizá es la oportunidad de dar el salto y dejar de vender solo palos y piedras, para empezar a vender tecnología avanzada. Mal que mal, el país invirtió en capacitar a su gente en el extranjero.

64 2018-09-23 17:06:38 My friend I clearly said targets were lower. But formula was same. Only crypto offers this kind of targets. Stock traders are happy even with 1% a month. Forex guys jump at 3-5%, commodities guy feel lucky if they can achieve 6%
65 2018-09-23 17:04:58 Prezado. É possível sustentar uma pais do tamanho de ovo com commodities. Finlandia , Dinamarca, Islandia são belos exemplos. Agora imagine a Italia sem seu norte indústrial. A propósito, ja viu o preço de banana na Alemanha?

67 2018-09-23 17:00:21 Actually trade war is good for us as it will keep the bond yields of USA in check and commodities as well if problems persist with China.

69 2018-09-23 16:45:51 There's a need to pull away with no deal and get trading with the rest of the world. Slam the door on Europe and see how much begging they do to sell their cars, wine and other commodities to the UK. No to  Europe's demands.

72 2018-09-23 16:34:56 bosses can "work" but they aren't imbibing commodities with value. they're usually manipulating the market to increase profit. they're also not having their labour stolen from them, as they are being compensated 100% for their time, plus the time they've stolen from their workers
73 2018-09-23 16:31:45 Pensá q tenías AFJP, Ypf privatizada, el ajuste de GP ya hecho, las commodities subiendo y las tasas bajando.
Podría chocar con el PJ si intentaba hacer una reforma laboral q todavía estaba pendiente, pero después era cuestión de administrar bien el viento de cola.
74 2018-09-23 16:03:34 Exactly. Energy is in a very poor period from seasonal perspective yet it isnt really showing up. The rest of the commodities prices at rock bottom on a multi year basis. If energy isnt allowed to be priced correctly 1H19 may become one of the strongest on record for commodities.
75 2018-09-23 15:41:47 Amigo, acá en Chile no fabricamos ni una cuchara! allá fabrican autos, aviones, trenes, etc. El empresario chileno vende commodities, invierte poco y recibe harto a cambio, es la idiosincrasia, eso no va a cambiar, llevamos varios años con lo mismo...
76 2018-09-23 15:39:40 Abolish drugs from your life and you will feel less dependent on capitalist commodities.
77 2018-09-23 15:39:00 Custom has fixed minimum import price for so many commodities and in dozens of commodities it's more than double of current market price. Very absurd. Wastage of US$ and creation of black money. It's hard to believe that it's happening under NAMO
78 2018-09-23 15:09:57 We need a crypto circular economy, one that reduces the need for cashing out to banks, if this is to be truly revolutionary. Otherwise, no different than commodities or stocks
79 2018-09-23 15:00:42 How educated women can support Trump baffles me. No man disrespects women more than Trump. They are commodities and play things to him. Sad very sad.
80 2018-09-23 14:55:42 La obligación de Banguat es mantener estabilidad y evitar picos y valles. Una economía altamente dependiente aún de commodities hace que en 18 meses los commodities principales perdieron 40% de su valor y el petróleo subió 40%. Eso haría una devaluación muy fuerte. 1/2
81 2018-09-23 14:46:20 Yes, corporations and the wealthy are doing great. But, for the middle class and lower, wages are stagnant and in many places housing is unaffordable to the average wage earner. Food prices and commodities are up because of your tariffs...and on and on. You are doing it for YOU!
82 2018-09-23 14:38:38 Ok, desculpe se a ofendi. Antes de 08 o BR vendia commodities à rodo. Tínhamos dinheiro pra reestruturar esse país. Se a receita dele fosse tão boa, Dilma teria ido bem. Mas não era. Os ingredientes que eram bons.
83 2018-09-23 14:31:55 Revisa el crecimiento de remesas. Pasamos de 4500 millones hace 10 años a 9200 este año. Este año entrarán más dólares por remesas que exportaciones. Eso inunda de dólares el mercado y genera excedentes. Últimos 13 meses subió el petróleo y Cayeron precios de commodities.
84 2018-09-23 14:31:49 Simpleton. Coal and steel community wasn't established to trade the two commodities. Steel and coal were two most important war effort resources at the time.
85 2018-09-23 14:30:03 Las remesas siguen creciendo a ritmo de 12-14% anual ultimos tres años y eso había provocado incluso una revaluación fuerte del quetzal hasta 16/08/17. Eso cambia con subida de petróleo y caída de commodities que exportamos.
86 2018-09-23 14:27:42 PATRONIZE SMALL VENDORS.

92 2018-09-23 13:30:42 This isn’t surefire—for example, despite being major trading partners, Germany and the UK fought World War I—and there’s no shortage of people willing to go to war, even at the cost of disrupted trade and scarce commodities. Moreover, “trade” is double-edged.
93 2018-09-23 13:30:30 Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Finland, where state owned industries are common place, post-secondary tuition is free, unemployment low, labour rights strong, and childcare and healthcare are treated as human rights rather than commodities to be bought and sold in the market.
94 2018-09-23 13:01:21 Of course not, they're not a real country, but rather a US vassal state. They will do whatever their master commands them to do. Only sovereign nations can make their own decisions regarding their economy & commodities

97 2018-09-23 12:58:04 @UKenyatta increasing fuel prices will lead to increase of prices of every commodities but not translate to what you will collect as income,  you should have reduced fuel price then increase the price of a commodities thus collect the added income. Just compare the difference.

112 2018-09-23 11:39:20 You will be amazed at how many Nigerians believe firmly in the concept of billing based on social class.

115 2018-09-23 11:26:30 @fayedsouza tax on fuel is  'WRONG'?
Would you kindly explain or this is a divine sermon- to be accepted no questions asked?
While at it- which are other commodities where tax is 'WRONG'? are there any where tax is RIGHT?
116 2018-09-23 11:25:47 The recent happenings are really frightening.  you experience anarchy and indiscipline in every walk of life. All talk of freedom & rights- speech, acts, religion, public behavior, employment, cheap availability of commodities and luxury items, health and education.
117 2018-09-23 11:19:47 Why does everything have to lead to a job? That’s the problem with Uni today, it’s about making widgets and cogs to create commodities. We need more people who choose to engage with the world for no motive other than because they want to.
118 2018-09-23 11:18:06 One thing I know for sure is that opinions are the cheapest of commodities.
119 2018-09-23 11:13:04 All good,  thanks for your concern. Hes a bit smarmy i'd say.  Kinda bloke you want to ask when he stopped beating his wife. What ive heard of some aged care facility providers attitudes to people as commodities fits with his free market gig economy cheerleading

122 2018-09-23 10:59:12 Over and above he could not take care of his constituency Varanasi 
Now talks about cleaning Ganga by taking loan and common man like us will pay either in form of Taxes or the prices of daily commodities will be increased
123 2018-09-23 10:57:32 Ppl talk lots about Indian chief and cancellation of talk but no one is talking about Stop useing Indian commodities  BAN on Indian FILMS and Shows on TV.
124 2018-09-23 10:57:21 With respect to Animal Liberation, we currently see that some animals are deemed ‘companions’ whilst others are commodities/objects. At the core is a deficit of empathy and knowledge. If you’ve visited a Farm Animal Sanctuary, you’d see these beautiful animals are individuals. 2/
125 2018-09-23 10:48:41 Yes we 2nd u stop Indian commodities films dramas .NO IMPORT FROM INDIA BEN BEN BEN
126 2018-09-23 10:29:57 Rupee is down & down. All imports are costly. The immediate measure is to stop total imports, essential or unessential. Give subsidies for commodities for economical backward class. Tax heavily on luxurious items (items other then eatables).Increase direct tax to elite levels.
127 2018-09-23 10:23:58 Wenye kuuza any type of poison, makamba etc. Make sure you lock those commodities out of stock mpaka tumalize kulipa deni ya China. Haiwezi kuwa eti kuna wazee wanataka kuchuka shortcut kwa kujiua eti anahepa heavy taxation. NO!!!!! We are in this together!!!!
128 2018-09-23 10:17:20 You say that like there’s something wrong with being privately educated, a commodities trader and/or aspiring to be elected to Parliament. All of which are eminently respectable choices in Britain.

133 2018-09-23 09:35:55 The common man didn’t lose over 10 million jobs been lost since 2015. Fuel, food and essential commodities were cheap. In this country common men started talking flights which came as low as 10k. Today no common man can dare it. The trademoni loan can’t even pay transport.
134 2018-09-23 09:34:04 Another scam in the making #AyushmanBharat , will benefit few private players, not poors. Ultimately burden on tax paying citizen who are already facing trouble because of expensive petrol, gas and other commodities.
135 2018-09-23 09:10:37 Unbelievable - why do some of these idiots think living things should be treated as commodities for humans? .....as if everything revolves around us. We are just part of it (and not a very good part at times)

140 2018-09-23 08:34:05 Talk about the price of commodities: rice, pulses, vegetables, potato, onion etc etc? All are cheaper from the price 3 years back.
141 2018-09-23 08:16:48 In coming next 2 or more years,US can find enough employee and managers and investors to rebuild their industrials system to replace these commodities imported from China? Cost and volume would be both good and  sufficient for USA market?

143 2018-09-23 07:32:18 Rafale and demonetisation are, no doubt, humongous scams of Modi-Shah. But let us not lose sight of unprecedented misery unleashed by the incompetent regime on ordinary people through sky-rocketing prices of fuels and essential commodities. #AmbaniAdaniSarkar
144 2018-09-23 07:31:38 Rahul Gandhi and his party is busy on rumours spreading. There should be display board in each market in India despite rise of petroleum price how the essential commodity prices are under control.

147 2018-09-23 07:18:49 Bjp will win in 2019. Wonderful handling of petrol price and not to allow escalation of essential commodities is a master stock of this govt. Namo all the way till 2029.
148 2018-09-23 07:14:39 #2019Edge essential commodities price are really under control. With petrol price going high , till now I haven't seen any price going high because of petrol prices. This govt has handled the situation much better than all previous govt in this regard. Namo is a doer, not afraid.

152 2018-09-23 06:20:24 Are you a commodities trader?
153 2018-09-23 06:16:00 Maybe Purchasing Power or Real Income? Since it’s involving multiple factors like the cost of other goods and commodities as well as rent and general cost of living what you get with your money is going to be different relative to your situation I guess???
154 2018-09-23 06:11:14 Love and Respect are not commodities, you don't buy them. They are virtues, you EARN them 
155 2018-09-23 06:06:19 Caro Alexandre, esse não é um dos principais problemas de países subdesenvolvidos? 

Certa vez ouvi de um analista americano algo do tipo "Brazil's economy is dependant on basic farming and resources gathering".

Em outras palavras: commodities, certo?

Isso não é um problema?

158 2018-09-23 05:41:05 @eikebatista O movimento compensou a desvalorização nos preços de várias commodities no ano e também da estabilidade no preço médio do minério de ferro, cotação diferente da praticada pela Vale para seu produto de melhor qualidade. "Desde janeiro, o ouro se desvalorizou 10%,
159 2018-09-23 05:40:48 Yeah, its terrible how they treat people like commodities. And the customer service people are the worst! No humanity, no compassion, just a book of rules and usually a bad attitude.
160 2018-09-23 05:29:21 It has.

Just the commodities markets...

He doesn't sound like the type of person that should be playing with futures tbh.
161 2018-09-23 05:27:18 You are going to tell me that increase in price commodities is going to affect someone in nyanza who can use jiko with sticks as his fuel MORE than it affects someone who has to depend on gas cooker which relays on fuel for his meals.

164 2018-09-23 04:49:14 Projeto Lula: taca um liberal tosco para comandar a economia e reza para as commodities se valorizarem. Enquanto isso engana a base de trouxas e da cargo no governo para os lideres dos movimentos sociais. Compra base aliada com mensalão e a mídia técnica.
165 2018-09-23 04:47:16 Here we go again. Still surprised why not plug loopholes first instead of increasing prices of commodities. Voodoo economics will not propel Kenya to middle income status

176 2018-09-23 03:35:59 Oh you're absolutely right, I guess I was exclusively thinking about things like TGS (conventions) where the money and time you're spending are for commodities first and foremost (playing unreleased games, seeing panels, access to a dealer's room with tons of niche merchandise).

180 2018-09-23 03:15:52 to maintain these social relations and to turn a profit, a few things need to be done. the first is to keep the means of production (the tools necessary to create commodities) in private hands. this hearkens back to when the state took the land from the peasants and sold it.
181 2018-09-23 03:11:07 E os dois em campos opostos são parecidos, tem projetos de poder não de país. Muita pessoas tem mais medo do Bolsonaro do que do PT, mas deveria ter medo de ambos. Lula só conseguiu governar bem devido o boom das commodities, o governo do PT real é o da Dilma.
182 2018-09-23 03:07:28 Just put you earnings ,and inflation data of other commodities also
183 2018-09-23 03:06:34 Because of the Godless collectivism of China. Individuals and animals are just commodities owned by the state.

189 2018-09-23 02:29:14 Los precios estánsujetos al riesgo pais. No se basan en el dólar solamente. Tb juega la inflación, además del valor intrínseco de los commodities
190 2018-09-23 02:20:42 For some reason I've always thought that food and other commodities were even more expensive in the NYC boroughs than it is here in the Twin Cities area.
191 2018-09-23 02:15:13 Because capital isn't machinesmachines- it's the social relation of the MCM' circuit. Whether it be in the money form or in commodities, if it forms part of the circuit that increases its own value (MCM'), it's capital.

194 2018-09-23 01:25:49 on average i probably look at over 100 different instruments a day between currencies, indexes, stocks and commodities.

197 2018-09-23 01:01:45 "The U.N. must act"? The U.N. has been trying to act. The USA & U.K., et al are the ones who need to have an ethical revolution that values all Living Beings and Things, never to be commodities for piracy profiteering.

201 2018-09-23 00:49:10 Which is so wrong. That man had no right to grab my breast. *I was 15.* He was an adult. Wouldn't have mattered if he had been 15. He was still wrong. The Republicans on Judicial committee think women are commodities. Shameful.

204 2018-09-23 00:19:40 Will we see a hand-off in next fiscal year to weak dollar winners--precious metals, commodities, emerging markets, US exporters? Will next yrs big stocks again be US QQQ type stuff? In 2007, QQQ peaked early Oct.
205 2018-09-23 00:16:57 This is a main driver for the #Tory #Brexit-at-any-cost mentality; the wealthy will vastly profit from supplying suddenly scarce commodities whilst workers' rights will be cut and environmental controls dismantled in the immediate post-#Brexit confusion.

217 2018-09-22 22:13:08 Do you think agriculture now is better than before? Ask yourself the prices of commodities now and why there’s hunger in the country.

219 2018-09-22 22:08:55 A imprensa sempre teve sua agenda própria.
Elas só defendiam os governos quando era conveniente agindo pela cartilha capitalista

Mas isso tb fez que eles fossem para as notícias superficiais espalhafatosas, viraram commodities e não podem competir com os blogs

Vide crise abril
220 2018-09-22 21:48:40 Private Central Banks charge pernicious illegal interest for lending their counterfeit money to the masses. This
“money” should have been the public’s own
money in the first place and should always be proportionately 1based on real precious metals and/or actual commodities.
221 2018-09-22 21:44:20 Because you can't trust the tories? They want to deregulate business, make more profit,  keep it in tax havens and treat workers as commodities. Best bit is they persuaded the working brit the EU was to blame and hey presto! Here we are! Can't wait for the movie to come out!
222 2018-09-22 21:35:56 E ainda tem o boom das commodities (acredito) que deve representar mais uma força na valorização da Petro.

232 2018-09-22 22:15:57 You do know that in a past life Nigel was a commodities broker? Not a profession known for its reliance on scruples, more manipulation and deceit?
233 2018-09-22 22:13:08 Do you think agriculture now is better than before? Ask yourself the prices of commodities now and why there’s hunger in the country.
234 2018-09-22 22:11:13 BTC and gold are commodities. 

ETF, futures/derivatives, spot, OTC globally traded, but only BTC can replace SWIFT.
235 2018-09-22 22:08:55 A imprensa sempre teve sua agenda própria.
Elas só defendiam os governos quando era conveniente agindo pela cartilha capitalista

Mas isso tb fez que eles fossem para as notícias superficiais espalhafatosas, viraram commodities e não podem competir com os blogs

Vide crise abril
236 2018-09-22 21:48:40 Private Central Banks charge pernicious illegal interest for lending their counterfeit money to the masses. This
“money” should have been the public’s own
money in the first place and should always be proportionately 1based on real precious metals and/or actual commodities.
237 2018-09-22 21:44:20 Because you can't trust the tories? They want to deregulate business, make more profit,  keep it in tax havens and treat workers as commodities. Best bit is they persuaded the working brit the EU was to blame and hey presto! Here we are! Can't wait for the movie to come out!
238 2018-09-22 21:35:56 E ainda tem o boom das commodities (acredito) que deve representar mais uma força na valorização da Petro.

240 2018-09-22 21:27:44 Rights do not equal commodities
241 2018-09-22 21:26:50 The EU started as an attempt to prevent conflict through mutual interdependency on commodities necessary for warfighting, whereas NATO was to deterr external agression. Also I suppose that NATOs expansion eastward has had no impact on the security enviroment at all (irony).
242 2018-09-22 21:07:26 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.
243 2018-09-22 21:07:25 I guess if Time, Money and, Sleep were commodities, I'll be well under the poverty line.

249 2018-09-22 20:08:57 Yes,  they are 100 percent commodities. I can take my kids to private schools and I can work a job to bring my own income instead of a UI. Both include a voluntary exchange of goods fully consensual. Tell me what is voluntary about socialism taking my money 
250 2018-09-22 20:02:32 The popular conception of a world without art, culture, work, and the circulation of commodities is seen as the end of the world instead of the beginning of a new one
251 2018-09-22 19:40:04 Sounds appropriate. Commodities and currencies can be used effectively in portfolio risk management.  But bitcoin, if you will, seems like an Offaly volatile hedge.
252 2018-09-22 19:39:39 I want the Blame game to stop
I want detention without trial to stop
I want inflation on commodities to stop
I want clueless ness to stop
253 2018-09-22 19:36:02 I see it as a subset of commodities, much like fiat currencies.
254 2018-09-22 19:23:54 Limitless alcohol + few gun restrictions + underfunded mental services + citizens struggling w gambling & debt + a culture where women are commodities + no state income tax to pay for fixes = skyrocketing domestic violence. That’s my guess as a local & I truly hope you address it
255 2018-09-22 19:18:19 Of the commodities you sell in YOUR supermarkets,how many are local,and how many r imported. I bet 80%of yo goods r imported.Why?SIMPLE  foriegn goods r cheaper than local.Why,bcoz cost of production in Zim is TOO HIGH. Solve that first.

Or is it another political move?

262 2018-09-22 18:34:40 Bingo. Will soon be changed to Human Commodities.
263 2018-09-22 18:32:18 China's trade policies are unfair.  Go read the catalog of Commodities which are restricted or prohibited from importing for used in the processing trade.  Or much easier just go 2 a flea market and buy a knock-off designer bag most likely it was made in China

270 2018-09-22 17:37:58 I am partial to teams buying on known commodities rather than Rookies who may or may not work. JB is a two way player with offensive skills and a hard worker. Murray and Harris could learn how to be pros from JB and it gives them another defensive wing. #nuggets
271 2018-09-22 17:30:21 Vote Red. Sosialism is real and has been in the making for years. The middle/lower class have been kept from working to earn a living to support their families. Foodstamps, food commodities, Housing, medical. if you exceeded certain limits, your rations would be cut or removed.
272 2018-09-22 17:10:56 Why are animals treated as commodities for humans to use and abuse we are the most cruel creatures on earth 
273 2018-09-22 17:05:29 Commodities are obviously different than products in a less competitive market.  The Chinese know that, so targeted soybeans
274 2018-09-22 17:05:14 Will this next trend reversal be accompanied by a commodities boom boosting emerging markets? Like in the 00s. Commodities to stocks ratio is near all time low

281 2018-09-22 16:00:08 Shouldn’t you and the government agencies concerned take a closer look at how the inflation rate is going with regards to the basic commodities like rice, meat, fish and canned goods? Some traders are taking advantage of the trend and overpricing is so rampant in the marketplace.

285 2018-09-22 15:39:34 Yes, we need commodities. But please rather explain how you live up to your responsabilities to the people that suffer due to #environmental disasters you cause. And what is your position on #Konzernverantwortungsinitiative Mr. #IvanGlasenberg?

292 2018-09-22 14:59:55 En segundo lugar la caída de los precios de commodities,  tal como lo evidenció el derrumbe de la soja de esta semana. El otro factor será el previsible incremento de presión exportadora de las potencias en ‘guerra’ hacia terceros mercados. @ninofernandez19
293 2018-09-22 14:57:12 Que "partidos de esquerda" no Brasil defendem que o país fique dependente de uma commodity? Você está confundindo de país! Quem defende uma economia acomodada nas commodities é a direita brasileira. Se dependesse dela, ainda seríamos meros exportadores de café.
294 2018-09-22 14:50:47 En países con dictaduras o medios muy concentrados por grupo poder político/ económico.."titulares commodities" inducen o a alto pesimismo ( el país se cae) o alto optimismo( lideres, oportunidades, etc).
Agenda Setting " teledirigida".
295 2018-09-22 14:43:45 I don't think he's ignorant.  He just does not care.  He doesn't think of women as human beings.  We are commodities to him, things to be used and abused for entertainment. I don't think there's much he does care about other than himself. He is sick and vile.
296 2018-09-22 14:39:49 I agree wedding. I told me the present to get meds from the house. Win a dah try telling me this good to him more veggies and commodities
297 2018-09-22 14:35:06 I don't understand why you Republicans even waste time making excuses.  Why don't you come out and just tell the world you look at women as commodities and whores and rich men of power are always right.  Please Republicans, especially women try and prove my opinion wrong.
298 2018-09-22 14:33:57 But your agenda is pushing to start paying for commodities through taxes too. Things like healthcare and education will cost trillions, meaning everyone’s taxes will go up. Just taxing the rich won’t be enough to pay pay for these demands.
299 2018-09-22 14:31:45 I said public roads  are public goods. Not commodities. Go back and reread. Things like Healthcare, UI, and education are commodities. There is a difference between a public good and a commodity. No one is disputing having to pay public goods in taxes.
300 2018-09-22 14:30:02 #Gold and #silver, like other #commodities, have an intrinsic value, which is not arbitrary, but is dependent on their scarcity.
301 2018-09-22 14:22:43 Your Governmental Entity should control rare commodities
302 2018-09-22 14:06:30 It's the chips and machines that become commodities, so that the profits in the end almost entirely are derived from energy and tax competition.
303 2018-09-22 13:52:29 I am a wholesale and a retail store owner and I wanna help our people and gov't to ease up their burden in all price hikes of our basic commodities; do we have any program to support my effort in line of reselling of our basic commodities in DTI's SRP?
304 2018-09-22 13:51:37 Why is that capitalism’s fault? That makes zero sense and there isn’t a shred of evidence to that. Capitalism is what drives up wages and down the cost of commodities. It’s government building restrictions and zoning laws that drive the prices up by artificially limiting supply.
305 2018-09-22 13:49:59 Different commodities have different standard measuring units:
  The standard unit for wheat is the bushel.
  The standard unit for gold is the troy ounce.
  The standard unit for oil is the barrel.
  The standard unit for honey is the plastic squeezy bear.

312 2018-09-22 13:32:55 As tariffs act to reverse the trend of stubbornly low wholesale pxs, CPI will rise next ($WMT). Combined w already rising wage inflation, along w energy/transportation costs soaring- #COMMODITIES weekly chart reversal maybe sensing a breakout in inflation is dead ahead.

313 2018-09-22 13:32:14 O que a Venezuela tem a ver com o Brasil? No Brasil, mesmo que porcamente, os governos sempre orientaram parte do superávit em commodities para a diversificação da economia. Enquanto isso, a Venezuela constrói a tragédia atual há mais de 50 anos, importando tudo o que consome!

317 2018-09-22 13:20:51 This week’s notable reversals feels more like market is sensing inflation is on the verge of breaking out. 
As an asset class #COMMODITIES are highly correlated w inflation; also the BZ REAL is the biggest commodity currency play in the world, & would rocketship higher.

321 2018-09-22 13:11:00 Money, qua commodity, certainly admits of being treated as a "phantom alienable object" (not sure how an object can be "phantom" but be that as it may), as do all commodities, for Marx. Not sure about "Marxism", though.
322 2018-09-22 12:58:35 - acting in the name of the Government, shall arrange for contracts which determine prices, secure the buying and selling of commodities, the levying of taxes on that industry, and pay losses on foreign dumping of any surplus.” -

324 2018-09-22 12:31:26 When I was an active trader, I was aiming for monthly 5% returns from my commodities/index CFDs trading. 100% based on day trading. However I was suspending my trading for the month as soon as I achieve my targets. Sometimes I Traded only day or two in entire month.
325 2018-09-22 12:11:17 If a couple of sixteen year olds want to get married... That's possibly a debate. But grubby old men exploiting poverty is sickening. We can't go on abusing women like this. They should be allowed to reach their full potential and no turned into commodities.

327 2018-09-22 12:03:28 Sir, i pray that the next discussion be of ur term extension. We can force that term to three through parliamentary ammendment courtesy of king Dwale. The price of commodities are still very low, lets make them reach 70% VAT on every commodity. Thanks you for ur lead
328 2018-09-22 11:53:33 Nooooo! It's utilising all available commodities to make sure your eggs don't come out like candy floss. Google it. Try It. You'll believe. 
329 2018-09-22 11:46:18 Tenemos ya apalabradas las commodities latinoamericanas, pero con el idioma, vamos a sacarlas más fácil y vender más fácil nuestras manufacturas.
330 2018-09-22 11:33:52 The argument is flawed, at least as long as the law requires the govt to keep the prices of basic commodity low. 2nd pt, basic commodities are everyday needs, luxury on the other hand isn’t and as a matter of fact preferential.
331 2018-09-22 11:14:00 I'm sorry but you need to understand something. Taming your dick comes first. 
You drive a beautiful car. I could argue that your flashing it everyday is an invitation for me to steal it since we're now equating bodies to commodities.
332 2018-09-22 11:11:05 State antitrust laws applicable to corporations but not to individuals, or to vendors of commodities but not to vendors of labor, have been upheld.
333 2018-09-22 10:36:48 Challenge these people to do without oil, gas, propane, and electricity. AND All the commodities produced by oil and gas also. Guess they want us depending on Iran and Saudi Arabia for our fuel.
334 2018-09-22 10:31:27 We need #agroecology and #FoodCommons approaches in small holder Africa focused on nutritionally important local crops NOT globalized commodities. And — to stop fucking with GE sorghum and Millet and pulses while we are at it. It’s disgusting.

Why attack a Senator who has displayed  that most rare of commodities in Seanad Eireann, i.e a functioning pair of balls !
337 2018-09-22 10:08:54 Exactly the same as all other govt spending. Not through taxes or robbing one budget for another but through money created by the treasury. It's really not that complicated. Besides, they wouldn't be buying commodities, but multi million pound industries with huge profit margins.
338 2018-09-22 10:06:30 Success is also not self seeking... material commodities are for the ill and weak minded. 
Our greatest success on earth is only reflected through what we gave or left to others through our journey.
339 2018-09-22 09:44:11 I mean, people aren't commodities anymore; it's big 21st century. People don't have "new" or "used" tags. Weird logic all around. Fantasizing over porn but then freaking out if the person you meet doesn't do that smh.

341 2018-09-22 09:34:36 IMO: Good = effective = people like it = commercial value. Pop songs are commodities and hence can be judged objectively by the metrics. Art is easy, the challenge is actually to inject as much art as you can without detracting from the commercial value.
342 2018-09-22 09:30:06 Precisely. In advanced nations, excess production of commodities is never a problem. Here in Kenya, the company manufacturing tomato sauce will lose their profits to taxes and energy costs. It's baad!
343 2018-09-22 09:24:33 Football players are treated as commodities, and expected to perform consistently like robots. Too many forget that they are actually humans too.
344 2018-09-22 09:22:39 The price hike of basic commodities is not an exclusive experience??? It affects everyone???
345 2018-09-22 09:20:06 The causation is the most mind numblingly obvious economics. A superfluity of non unionised Labour causes compression in wages. Also higher prices for commodities, housing etc. Pressure on public services. Especially when mirrored with right wing economic policies.
346 2018-09-22 09:17:35 With the new bankable projects we’ve being presenting to #afdb & @edmnangagwa, it shows a move towards transforming the value chain in farming & mining..commodities supply chain are firmly in our sites @arutura
347 2018-09-22 09:01:56 I read that some incels feel they should be part of the LGBTQIA+ umbrella, and, um, no.
Your identity is predicated on the notion that you deserve sex, and that women are less than you. You treat others like commodities and objects. That kind of hateful ideology has no place here
348 2018-09-22 08:53:31 Yes, cross borders to do business. Did you miss the bit where thousands are crossing into Tigray to purchase commodities? No tax, no currency disputes. People just happily doing business, as it was meant to be.
349 2018-09-22 08:41:34 Animals are someones. It is our society that has turned them into mere commodities. We believe cats and dogs are part of our families, but kill others?
350 2018-09-22 08:31:25 America's disrespect for women is the same as Muslim countries who view women as commodities. Who ever thought Americans would stoop so low? This is a bad example to set for the world.
351 2018-09-22 08:24:56 They should be burning rubbish,not useful commodities. Build an incinerator on land fill sites,lorries that already empty our bins could then feed it.
352 2018-09-22 08:20:59 Why don’t you call it Canada minus minus because we are not Canda, we export services not commodities and we depend logistical supplies chains with Europe based on free movement. Always, always you paint positive on government policies when there are none.

354 2018-09-22 08:04:41 Shebi we have the West Africa Gas Pipeline originating from Escravos. We could have easily been the Russia of West Africa and controlled the energy market trends of the sub-region. We could have even setup a regional commodities market...
355 2018-09-22 07:33:28 Had you forgotten the days when Hindustan budget was finalized in Bombay House by all major businessmen of Hindustan discussing how much excise will be increased to increase the rates of commodities already in finished goods conditions & in stocks?

358 2018-09-22 07:26:17 @SecSonnySays  Hi Sec. Sonny! Have you heard of the Goods and Services Tax in  India,w/c collects destination-based taxes? Sir, this may solve our perennial problem on smuggling, jurisdiction problem on shipments' cases by courts, overpriced commodities ...

360 2018-09-22 07:20:40 El crecimiento no fue mérito de él, fue la suerte del boom de los commodities y el billón en pérdidas esta por el pago excesivo de intereses como lo mostró Rodrigo Lara

363 2018-09-22 07:10:03 Dear government,

Here are the commodities 'I' the voice of the people suggest to be taxed
1. Cigarettes
2. Betting industry
3. All drinks 
4. Bhang after legalizing it etc

South Africa this is our opportunity to diversify, create out footprint in Africa. We need to change our business plan from i cannot to i can.
365 2018-09-22 06:28:03 The economy is bad. Fuel is costly. Basic commodities are costly, renting houses and apartments are too high, life is tough in Kenya, well all these are complaints from the people that voted for Jubilee! #DontBlameRaila @lagaless @KinyanBoy @Sam_Lulli @Kingpin_stoner @BusakaMwoke
366 2018-09-22 06:18:29 Comes from the commodities credit corp dept agri ag which provides price support for farmers Theyre allowed to draw funds from treasury without congress approval. It makes billions of non recoverable payments each year. Trump took money from here It basically just incurs debt

368 2018-09-22 06:05:03 3235: Retailer Assigned for use with all commodities
369 2018-09-22 05:54:19 If it is really a BRAND, does it need reminding? Brands need to engage customers through by creating better customer experiences. This is nothing but pushing commodities with a name. Reminding doctors of payback for goodies offered.

371 2018-09-22 05:22:06 Mr President how can we be united if you keep on impoverishing poor Kenyans by introducing heavy taxation on commodities used by poor Kenyans. You've worked so hard to widen the gap between the rich and the poor. You have no legacy
372 2018-09-22 05:20:30 I work in financial services. I know exactly how much farmers make and it certainly isn’t a small profit. 
Ma and Pa farmer don’t exist any more. Big corporations do. They treat animals as nothing more than commodities. The business owners hire low paid immigrant workers.
373 2018-09-22 05:19:05 Na medida em que nos relegamos a produtores de commodities em troca da balança comercial positiva (poupança externa) para pagar juros ao sistema financeiro. E isso só interessa a 200 famílias em todo o país: Brachers, Setúbals, Salles... e os acionistas made in USA.
374 2018-09-22 05:06:41 Food? the cost of commodities take eg of a cooking oil has shot up frm 64 to 89 now ? can a poor guy afford this? see if u wanna live how it takes to be to hate things happenin be in the shoes of a daily wage worker
375 2018-09-22 04:57:45 What economists know but fail to champion is that anyone involved in the international sale of commodities are subject to international prices. Carbon pricing fits in on the COP side. That’s it. That’s their failure. IT doesn’t reflect price received/paid.
376 2018-09-22 04:45:16 Speeches will not reduce the prices of basic commodities but walking the talk.
377 2018-09-22 04:42:38 People like Donald trump are unmindful of problem of such victims and their families. For them women are just commodities and they cannot think like normal humans.
378 2018-09-22 04:41:42 Hey! Farm commodities prices are lower! But all that was supposed to be exported anyway. AND corn producers getting 1/3 cent per bushel from USDA to compensate for dropping prices. There’s federal planning for ya!
379 2018-09-22 04:41:41 Commodities: zero.
380 2018-09-22 04:37:26 But it smells good. Plus its the thing i get paid in and buy stuff with, its value fluctuates somewhat, but its stable enough for daily use. But investing is different, buying etfs, mutual funds, stocks, bonds, land, commodities, and currencies is how your money gains value >

384 2018-09-22 04:12:39 Por lo tanto el valor de los commodities caería, y la entrada de dólares sería menor, tanto para la economía como para el gobierno en forma de retenciones .

411 2018-09-22 00:05:03 The savage brutality of the New World is reflected today in our cell memory behavior&laws-where civility ran amuck while wars waged over land as people were either obstacles or commodities, and money&power became the American dream-at any cost.

471 2018-09-21 19:30:11 Not at all due to the cost of commodities. Especially when we depend solely on trades and import. Let us not speak as scholars. The situation on the ground regarding jobs in SA is an exploitation of the masses under pretence to employ and accumulation of profits.

•Setting up standards- @KEBS_kesets up quality standards and ensures that commodities meet those standards. It ensures that commodities are examined and tested before being sold. #KnowYourConsumerRights
475 2018-09-21 19:17:24 Hi, I put you in the thread. Apologies for causing any stress. Social media will go in circles I'm afraid. The intent is simple. Something is drastically going wrong with how we are educating our young people. They have become commodities.

488 2018-09-21 18:16:10 sorry we do not accept commodities in trade 
489 2018-09-21 18:16:08 Ok, so in a period of high production, a glut in commodities causes downward pricing pressures, so you store the commodity (or sell for cheap which further encourages low prices).  

Storage brings into play accounting best practices such as inventory valuation methods.

499 2018-09-21 17:11:40 I don't think that's a serious remark, but the serious response:

Russia can't get commodities to market. Iowa gets commodities to market. That's just logistic science. Iowa has more miles of functional road per capita than any country in the world. This amazed the Russkies.

501 2018-09-21 17:03:54 De fato, muita coisa deveria ter sido feita, como dependermos menos da exportação de commodities e aumentar o valor agregado do que exportamos. Isso ainda pode ser feito, se um governo com uma equipe econômica muito boa for eleita (o que pelas pesquisas não é o caso)
502 2018-09-21 16:57:00 The rethoric is: at the time Lula was president the economy was good(and it was...becouse of the rise of the price of the commodities and lots of credit reaching the poor)and people could buy things. These people don´t have any instruction(we don´t have conservative tv or press).
503 2018-09-21 16:43:17 Problem with economy is that it will never work on our advantage, if we don’t know our worth as a nation. Foreign countries have mining commodities, they just won’t cut a tree that feeds them like us. Give him a GTI (VW) on credit, and put explosives under His feet.

508 2018-09-21 16:23:52 America’s captains of industry, who themselves often rose from very modest circumstances, saw workers as commodities to be dealt with like any raw material. ..ruthless ...impervious to the negative effects, ...they hired their own armies to deal with recalcitrant laborers.

525 2018-09-21 15:01:23 My conjecture was that the driver of destabilising currency crises in dev'g countries pre-1973 or so was BOP problems linked in part to declining terms of trade for commodities. Post-1973 the driver of crises was cross-border borrowing. Hence my Q about shift in focus over time.

528 2018-09-21 14:45:56 there's an economic answer to that question. more people buy male condoms. common commodities aren't as expensive as rarer commodities.

- why aren't women buying female condoms?

531 2018-09-21 14:32:31 This will now reverse. EA being more diversified & not commodity driven, benefited a lot from low oil prices as we are net oil importers. The other countries are heavily dependent on commodities & oil, and were affected by low commodity/oil prices.

546 2018-09-21 13:27:02 Yes I’m familiar. But there were 7 years of economic recovery overall. then commodities crashed in 2015 which slow growth & employment. Then we followed that w/ commodities rising + a tax cut. My point here is...of course the market went up and faster, because water is wet.

556 2018-09-21 12:50:33 even the commodities issue is subordinated to the currency regime because current account imbalances under Bretton Woods led to crises of confidence in the currency peg and need for extra reserves
557 2018-09-21 12:49:03 Baby oil is one of those commodities that I always contemplate whether to throw out or not. But, every once in a while, I find a really good use for it.

581 2018-09-21 11:19:25 i like to scroll through pinterest for trivial things like mens fashion, haircut inspiration, new gym workouts.. where do we draw the line and have a healthy work/life balance if every social media platform is consumed by work related commodities? #cantescape #QFSchools
582 2018-09-21 11:18:10 I think the 'psychological contract' is fundamentally broken. Data suggests employees are increasing unhappy at work and fundamentally mistrust their employers. Employers treat employees like disposable commodities.
583 2018-09-21 10:59:39 in the book Street Smarts, by legendary commodities trader Jim Rogers, he mentions the Dow closed at 800 in 1964 - and in 1982 it was still at 800 - I'm sure I prefer these times :)
584 2018-09-21 10:55:21 Had any other person assumed  that presidential office, I would still have risen even worst than it is now. Even in America, prices of commodities have not been that stable.
585 2018-09-21 10:52:24 Those who are saying that the prices of  rice and other food stuffs have risen only since Buhari assumed office should go back and check the prices of same commodities before/after Obasanjo, Yaradua and Jonathan. They will discover that it's been rising all through
586 2018-09-21 10:48:42 Goldman Sachs dijo que un dólar más fuerte no cambia su punto de vista alcista sobre commodities, y que a lo mejor encuentren soporte por escasez de físicos. Dólar más firme, por economía USA más fuerte, es señal positiva para crecimiento mundial, dijo  el Banco de Inversión.
587 2018-09-21 10:46:23 Hi Thomas, they seem to be on the rise a bit now.  Takes a few moments until danger is recognized.  Despite the obvious manipulation, the commodities and cryptos are rising a bit at the moment.  It will most likely get wacked down again by the powers that be.

590 2018-09-21 10:31:10 When on Wall Street, financial companies encourage insecure loans, package the loans to trade as commodities to make tons or money, then they short the market so they again make money as the market tanks, they're redistributing wealth upwards, away from the poor toward the rich.
591 2018-09-21 10:30:48 Did you hear the claptrap that the economist who is on the PM’s counsel was spewing. Blamed the hike in petroleum to air travel and cars. Completely ignored its impact on transportation of essential commodities.
592 2018-09-21 10:04:05 Sir the petrol prices are very high. The food commodities prices are very high.we middle class people really cannot cope up with this . Please do some thing . We are in very bad situation. From all janta we wish you happy birthday.

605 2018-09-21 08:31:51 Not everything. Assets majority backed by utility aren’t. Shares in profitable companies, real estate, commodities at utility value (not gold/silver).

614 2018-09-21 07:34:53 Again, you were talking about this deal, as if it proved the Customs Union as a whole is not an issue to our trade globally, this is a straw man and disingenuous sophistry, a tactic adherents to the neo-imperial EU use constantly. The tariffs for different commodities are online.
615 2018-09-21 07:30:08 Saleable commodities memory is very short, hence it is no big deal in changing statements or sides if the price is right. So when there is no memory there is no AZAAB.

630 2018-09-21 06:31:17 So in effect, what you're stating can be done using the input output mechanism which will help us in determining the extent of "importance" of certain commodities and the elasticity of the output with respect to change in prices of the inputs (cross price elasticty of production)
631 2018-09-21 06:29:44 The idea of the input-output method is to see how the commodities are being consumed and used in the economy so it will help see which inputs are critical and which aren't. This helps enormously in studying the inter-industry linkages.

690 2018-09-21 02:20:24 Think about the 276 million people in India who live below $1.25/day. Fuel price hike escalates the price of regular "necessary goods" too. Think about the long run ! 

P. S. Fuel price isn't just about driving ! It affects the market supply and prices of other commodities too.
691 2018-09-21 02:14:28 The majority of commodities depend on transportation to the west coast.

695 2018-09-21 01:39:18 Engraçado todo mundo culpa o PT pela crise, ninguém fala das pautas-bomba, da queda dos preços das commodities e da volatilidade do dólar que atingiu nossa economia.

697 2018-09-21 01:29:05 O PT rebaixou o padrão de miséria,e só obteve êxito na época de alta das commodities e de crescimento econômico mundial.O erros foram começar a dar resultado nos governos Dilma,com a crise que temos hoje.ONU sempre se mostrou interessada em defender certos interesses políticos.
698 2018-09-21 01:24:48 I would disagree, commodities are real, tangible, fiat currency is nothing but a promise.
699 2018-09-21 01:22:56 record companies would treat them less like commodities and let them have more breaks between albums etc.

704 2018-09-21 00:54:57 As it turns out, the prices of commodities are not 100% related to the calamities.

My observation dictates that high prices are 100% related to the greed of business people.

Up to the reader to agree.
705 2018-09-21 00:46:17 #Trade talk should remind policy makers that now more than ever, information providers living in rural areas need to connect to the digital silk road. It's important that information on commodities, goods, and services gets to the globe via #broadband.
