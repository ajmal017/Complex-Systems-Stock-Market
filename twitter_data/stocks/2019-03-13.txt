40 2019-03-13 23:44:16 Isn't it though? Makes me want to go check who bought arms stocks in 2001. Wonder who, besides Mary Bush...
41 2019-03-13 23:44:06 Most of the stocks that run have an AS increase and a pending RS. $DSGT has real products and revenue stream. Company is going through a paradigm shift.
42 2019-03-13 23:43:31 I know what you mean re over-trading - last year I would hold up to 60 stocks at a time and auto trade them with conditional buy and sells. The last couple of weeks I am focusing more on intra / inter day trades and holding no more than 2 or 3 at a time and making more money...
43 2019-03-13 23:43:16 I truly believe @facebook was hacked. Why hasn't @Twitter gone down? Facebook isn't safe. Sell your stocks. #FacebookDown #instagramdown
44 2019-03-13 23:42:46 If 33 cent moves on low float garbage penny stocks is "hitting home runs" then I'm Babe Freakin' Ruth slugging it out against futures HFT algos. These strategies are all watered down variations on Sykes and Modern Rock who actually know WTF they're doing in this lane.
45 2019-03-13 23:42:29 oh u mean the stock that 4 to 5 other people own that same stock and u could never actually take possession of those stock, yea u sure own them and the rich elite and banks take a hair cut off those stocks every 2 yrs and take ur money, u mean those stocks!
46 2019-03-13 23:42:08 I’m never selling my Apple stocks!!!
47 2019-03-13 23:41:30 $JNCE +83%

56 2019-03-13 23:35:24 Because Bitcoin has no value whereas stocks are ownership of a proportion of something of value, a company.
57 2019-03-13 23:35:06 Definitely some AD related stuff like CC, stocks,brushes and splashes, and most of all PNGS. It would be an awesome pack since you're creative at AD work.

63 2019-03-13 23:33:34 When i was in 8th grade my English teacher had us play fake stocks based on a book we were reading. If you won, you could either get a pizza party for your class or take the $15. 

BITCH I won out of 60-80 students and I took the money, fuck you all annoying ass bitches
64 2019-03-13 23:33:32 @Cathy44 @USCKristy @CoderBlix @bjvz16

80 2019-03-13 23:25:21 Dear @Walgreens and @cvspharmacy   I contacted you about 7 years ago asking why you sell cigarettes and alcohol. Never got a response. I see your stocks are down 10-15% this year and the FDA is investigating you for selling more cigarettes to young adults than any other chains.
81 2019-03-13 23:24:57 Think we will see 3200 and sub 1 growth at sametime but cannot fight the tape, everyone thinks stocks are risk free
82 2019-03-13 23:22:47 Latin American stocks soared on Wednesday with Brazil shares hitting an all-time high on hopes that a long-awaited pension overhaul will be passed soon, while regional currencies mostly gained against a weaker dollar.
83 2019-03-13 23:21:51 Viewpoint - I am unable to discuss my investing with, “the Market” for obvious reasons. It is controlled by others. It won’t listen to me. It interrupts me when I think it should go up or down, opposite of my expectancy. So I invest my own way, to profit.

91 2019-03-13 23:19:02 I want to buy stocks. That is an adult thing I haven't done yet.
92 2019-03-13 23:17:42 ASX open. Portfolio: down 0.40%; total, loss 2.02%. A2M, down, $13.81. Other stocks, subdued. Aquna, 18c.
93 2019-03-13 23:16:41 U.S. stocks rose on Wednesday,led by gains in healthcare shares, & Boeing edged upward even as the United States joined other nations in grounding the firm's 737 MAX jets.
94 2019-03-13 23:15:48 He was nerfed and buffed in some aspects. Sourspot ftilt is worse in my opinion, and I feel like it would help him secure stocks if he could at least push off with it at low %'s. 

I don't see the issue, Lucas is absent from majors so a few small buffs to help is neutral isnt bad
95 2019-03-13 23:14:01 They are still down until now. Maybe following the Boeing stocks down down hahaha
96 2019-03-13 23:13:35 I thought stocks were dull but now I see you have way more retail participation and yeah they screw you for a penny or 2 or 3 on fills but the back fill is not as bad. you can get behind a move easier and way too many orders coming even for supercomputers to worry about YOU
97 2019-03-13 23:13:10 Did her thank Dennis Boeing, aeh, Daniel Muilenburg for the big amount?
Did @realDonaldTrump has had enough time to sell all Boeing stocks before he grounded the 737 fleet?
98 2019-03-13 23:12:58 Think the business is just buying and selling stocks with a mix of cocaine sprinkled in.. shits wild
99 2019-03-13 23:10:56 Kpop is wild. It just plays like a combo of Velvetta and a pump-n-dump scheme where the people actually making money never get in trouble and the stocks are the lives of those kids
100 2019-03-13 23:10:33 #FacebookDown, Twitter stocks up I bet...
101 2019-03-13 23:09:52 Time to sell your Twitter and Facebook stocks, the next drop $ should be spectacular
102 2019-03-13 23:09:29 I'm going to get me some Orville Redenbacher stocks I'll be a billionaire after 2020
103 2019-03-13 23:08:49 Weird how banking stocks went up after the royal commission
104 2019-03-13 23:08:35 All legislators & Admin members should be required by law to put stocks/bonds in blind trusts while in office.  No-brainer.

Boeing donates $1 million to Trump inaugural & Trump delays Max 8 grounding after phone call from Boeing CEO?

This should NEVER happen.
105 2019-03-13 23:05:24 Waiting for when it becomes  illegal to hold stock after writing legislation that boost the very stocks invested in. Divestment from that criminal scheme would go a hella long way to restore trust in this system.  That and make it illegal to swing into similar private sector jobs
106 2019-03-13 23:04:52 None directly in stocks or Bonds unless you count the fact that @opg is publicly owned, so I guess we all own Nuclear here, but I work for a company that will be building new Nuclear.
107 2019-03-13 23:04:48 OK ready to buy jyp stocks, damn.
108 2019-03-13 23:04:43 After trading with @TSXtrad3r for a month and focus on defining my edge I've finally narrowed my strategy on paper for small cap and mid cap stocks. 3 trades this week on paper. Waiting on my money to clear for live trading. It's going to be fun for the rest of the year.
109 2019-03-13 23:04:40 News can’t get any better without the stocks making a significant move up

137 2019-03-13 22:52:02 Full hopping sparingly is fine. ZSS has a strong jump-in Nair which can punish whiffed projectiles and Ftilts very well and will lead to combos that naturally carry Belmonts to the ledge consistently. They will get chip damage on hit whereas you will get stage control or stocks.

141 2019-03-13 22:49:47 AUD 10yr, now below 2%, as consumers feel the strain. Hard to see the RBA moving before the election. But later cuts appear fully priced in to stocks & REITs.
142 2019-03-13 22:49:23 If a cow farts in Iowa the Stock Market goes down 10 points. The stock market has become the Las Vegas vending machine for wealthy elites who often control the buying & selling of stocks (so it's not always a reflection of the economy but a game of craps that can be manipulated).

148 2019-03-13 22:46:25 Actually if you did research you will see a lot if the countries that grounded their flights are due to the government having partial ownership / oversight. Here in the USits the airlines / stocks / FAA which pushed back that they were safe. He did a good thing here (for once)

152 2019-03-13 22:42:33 "Eugenicists believed in the innate superiority and inferiority of races on a scale.
They were very worried--remember that we had no immigration laws then- about unimpeded immigration and how that would lead to a dilution of the superior racial stocks in America."

161 2019-03-13 22:32:49 Well anything can happen, but given how conservative that our with margins for most stocks. It would seem others would have to go first like IG markets before they go.
162 2019-03-13 22:32:44 Is Ms. Crooks going to repeat The stocks script EVERY DAY ???@Nationwideradio
163 2019-03-13 22:32:13 It's back :-) it won't be gone for long. They're just doing some system check. It won't be gone for long or cease to decease. The stocks are still up, soaring and roaring. Hehe
164 2019-03-13 22:31:39 College is an investment and an expensive one at that. I wouldn't advise someone to invest in esoteric stocks because there's no return. Don't advise people to invest their lives into esoteric degrees.
165 2019-03-13 22:31:06 Looks like Boeing was also touched. I wonder how the market will react to Boeing stocks tomorrow.
166 2019-03-13 22:30:47 Right now is the time to invest stocks on Instagram. Shits been fucking up
167 2019-03-13 22:30:36 What? Stocks have been always been processed based on future earnings potential.
168 2019-03-13 22:29:59 Except Apple. My Weed stocks are making me the most $$$ in the stock market.
169 2019-03-13 22:29:58 The fact is ppl are comfy with what they know. Including their laughing stocks. They don’t want to let it go bc theyre accustomed...when in reality Cleveland has been better at most of the cities laughing at us for like the last 5 or 6 years. And before that with bron.

176 2019-03-13 22:27:50 Good time to short this is Friday near market close. Triple witching on Friday in March and December is about the most bullish weeks of the year as people rollout of options and into stocks. Also, buyback blackout period really gets going next week. This week is buyback mania

178 2019-03-13 22:25:41 She’s right. I own a car, a computer and stocks. I know the ins and outs of all of them. If my car’s electrical system malfunctions, my computer is infected with a virus or the market crashes I know how to fix it all.

186 2019-03-13 22:21:26 That’s great- but why don’t you do something about the fact otters have decimated specimen fish stocks and waterfowl numbers? It’s really about time you pulled your head out of the sand.
187 2019-03-13 22:21:19 @facebook and @Twitter stocks soar after Instagram is down for 5 hours
188 2019-03-13 22:21:19 The reason it does in traditional markets PROBABLY wouldn't apply to crypto, for the most part.

In penny stocks, it causes dumps because what they do is this:
189 2019-03-13 22:21:04 Do y’all invest in stocks? Or believe in investing in stocks?
190 2019-03-13 22:19:13 Don't play the penny stocks.
191 2019-03-13 22:18:28 Could it be that Mr. May at work be expecting to make a ton of cash betting on Brexit, betting that the pound and UK stocks to fall ?

199 2019-03-13 22:15:51 The real money is always on the long side. Shorting is a specialty. Only specialists short stocks. Thats all i need to know. The market can drop 5000 points and i will still be looking to go long...
200 2019-03-13 22:15:29 Just like your bearish anti trump commentary    Spook people out of stocks.   Nice job

202 2019-03-13 22:14:02 私たちの株式投資への意欲をなくさせるような要因がかなりある。
There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks. (131)
203 2019-03-13 22:13:44 I dunno, I've seen them out polishing their Zimmers into shape and stocks of polygrip are running low.
204 2019-03-13 22:13:38 Stocks plunged as INTL FCStone Inc. unveiled a smart bangle bracelet today.
205 2019-03-13 22:13:29 With this match bein' held on Dream Land, it was hard to watch. I don't agree with what @Matt_SSBU said about the FE folk, but seein' @Boy_The_Roy gimp'em and spike him on his last 2 stocks was disheartenin'. Next up is @Alph_SSBU vs. fan favorite, Jeeves, on Yoshi's Island!
206 2019-03-13 22:13:28 Too much BS on iHub and ultimately I find iHub has no bearing on how stocks perform... It just gets too emotional there...

208 2019-03-13 22:12:48 The value of all US companies & associated stocks comes to 38T. Value of all US residential & commercial real estate is 33T. Value of all US citizen assets is ~ 28T. Total, ~ 100T. So if we confiscate & sell all, we have 93T for Green New Deal with 7T to spare. How’s that @AOC

224 2019-03-13 22:06:11 The stock market makes absolutely no sense. Boeing’s 737 Max is now grounded worldwide, yet the stocks of Boeing and its two main US operators US, American and Southwest, all go up. And this is where we put our money?  - @maddow @Oprah @BarackObama @harconsulting @Lawrence @AC360
225 2019-03-13 22:06:10 RE: "If you had put $100 into U.S. stocks in March 2009, you would have made more than $300 by now." Ha ha. No. It is really you would have made about $400 by now. Ouch. Not good.

231 2019-03-13 21:56:29 How are @facebook stocks still rising when it’s been out for a quarter of a day 
232 2019-03-13 21:56:18 I don't have a sore cycle I rode $ROKU from 41 to 70 so I'm good. I've been doing this since 1990 mutual funds October 1997 stocks by late 1998 found CANSLIM and adopted that pretty much as my style. I'm a volume based trader. VVS= Volume Viagra Spikes

234 2019-03-13 21:54:17 What broker do you use? I was easily able to establish a regular position. It is normal for most mid caps stocks to appear thin on extreme volume dryups.
235 2019-03-13 21:53:21 we’ve discussed this before, ppl expect too much from stocks! 
236 2019-03-13 21:53:12 Melton/Lonzo/Thybulle/BI/Clarke are where defensive dreams are made. (No seriously, they might get stocks on like 20% of all of their possessions or something absurd like that)
237 2019-03-13 21:51:35 J’ai refait mes stocks, vider mes sacs de bidons vides et non, tout est bon.

238 2019-03-13 21:50:58 There will be many more stocks like $GH in the future. You managed risk and that is way more important than missing out on a move like this. Get back into a position of strength by patiently waiting for proper entries. Break that sore cycle immediately.

246 2019-03-13 21:43:49 How was everyone's trading day?  Good, bad, ugly? Learn anything?  I learned I still play some stocks like a dumbass. $IGNG could have played it so much better.  Profit is profit, but definitely a lot of missed opportunity there.
247 2019-03-13 21:43:10 Due to an overwhelming response, the current stocks have run out. We will be announcing the next sale date soon. -Ravindra
248 2019-03-13 21:42:26 Wish I had the #LobsterTail concession! BTW, is this why lobster is SO expensive? Their buying drove up the price. Sounds like what they do with #Stocks to influence the market.
249 2019-03-13 21:41:12 Intra day trading of US Mega Cap Stocks is a tough business
250 2019-03-13 21:40:59 But it’s his job? That’s like saying someone who works 9-5 is sacrificing their time to go to work. I don’t get this game at all. Should we thank everyone for going to work? Should I seek out the guy who stocks the shelves at the store I’m about to go to?
251 2019-03-13 21:40:00 Highly Recommended:

Learning to Day-Trade stocks.

Even if you agree to blow $1,000, you will learn things about yourself that you cannot, any other way.

Best money spent.

258 2019-03-13 21:36:05 Buttocks spelled backwards is stocks. Stocks is money. Money is in bank. Some banks are built in a triangle shape. There’s triangle in Illuminati. Buttocks is in Illuminati.

261 2019-03-13 21:34:53 People often say "stocks always go up over the long term." But what they mean is "US stocks always go up over the long term." What they should say is "always have gone up, but past performance..."

270 2019-03-13 21:31:00 yes sir, that is correct. you can set a stop just like stocks. limit or market stop, at what ever price you want. 10 cents on AMZN is completely unrealistic but 10 cents on AAPL is not.
271 2019-03-13 21:30:38 @twitter i mean it if u change the layout i’m leaving and if i leave ur stocks will DECREASE
272 2019-03-13 21:30:32 I've tried several times over the years to understand how options work & every time it just makes my head hurt. So I just stick w/ owning the stocks themselves & funds.

275 2019-03-13 21:29:47 Spanky, unemployment was lower at points in the 1950s and 1960s. The economy was MUCH better in the 1990s - growth averaged 4% from 1992-1999 (you haven’t averaged 3%), and stocks quadrupled in value! @cnn @mmfa @SpeakerPelosi
276 2019-03-13 21:29:30 Watching bowser get spiked and then IMMEDIATELY footstooled by adult link for 2 stocks in like 15 seconds makes me happy
277 2019-03-13 21:29:12 There’s over 100 companies with separate use cases for xrp under xpring alone. 100s outside of xpring. Capital calls, provenance, issuing stocks/gold etc on the blockchain, retail, gaming, decentralized exchange, identity, micropayments, web and entertainment monetization etc
278 2019-03-13 21:28:44 Facebook and Instagram are fucked up because @jamescharles got people to ddos them when his Instagram account got suspended for calling someone an nword (without buying my nword pass for sale for only 30k unlimited stocks lads)
279 2019-03-13 21:27:15 Trump announces laws, policy changes, "proclamations" etc. over Twitter and calls it LAW. He only declares an emergency when he also has a hidden agenda. What will he do, freeze stocks? classify data? violate another civil right?
280 2019-03-13 21:26:48 Funny how we’re taught to be in debt all over a credit score BUT not taught how to not owe any one and have money just grow through 401K or stocks.
281 2019-03-13 21:26:24 Smaller company's stocks tend to be more volatile than larger, more established stocks. #BA3500Austin
282 2019-03-13 21:26:02 Xrp has dozens of use cases right now from gaming to remittance, web monetization/micro payments, retail, issuing tokenized assets on the blockchain like gold and stocks etc
283 2019-03-13 21:25:04 Not necessarily. Not if it punches a large hole in future cashflows. That’s how stocks work for major corporations. Boeing will be very, very concerned about this.
284 2019-03-13 21:24:57 I have clue where it is heading man - imagine if almost entire #fintwit community and their moms were sure that 2018 Dec is The End and Start of Worst Recession Ever - and those members have years and years of solid experience re everything re stocks then we could be wrong too 
285 2019-03-13 21:24:30 Today’s Smash games were hilarious as HECC! Stocks were robbed!

287 2019-03-13 21:23:50 Volatility in stocks is a measure of dispersion of returns of the stock. If a stock has high volatility, its price tends to fluctuate more than other securities.   #BA3500Austin

299 2019-03-13 21:17:12 Not happening, turns out it's unconfirmed market speculation.
Take Two stocks went up and some business dude thought it's because Sony is planning to acquire them.
If you ever see the stocks going up, tweet some fake ass information and the media might go crazy over it.
300 2019-03-13 21:16:53 Ya they made a decent chunk. The company is valued at 40-45B I believe based on stocks (38B in 2016 was most recent I could find) and take-two is roughly 15B. Would a company worth 40B really have half of that in cash?
301 2019-03-13 21:16:23 j'ai pas besoin d'être parano ya des h de bandes images ds les stocks des matchs de C1 qui sont paranos pr moi

308 2019-03-13 21:14:16 Well most people don't think that way. Most people own stocks and mutual funds of all these corporations.

312 2019-03-13 21:12:47 @Boeing is going down in stocks
313 2019-03-13 21:12:31 Internet security stocks entering a disproportionate bullish zone.  Last time was 18 months ago, which lead to rampant breakouts.
314 2019-03-13 21:12:25 Each player will start with a traditional 50 stocks, or 'lives',
315 2019-03-13 21:12:17 Most 401ks usually don't have individual stocks other than the company's. Exposure is usually in bonds and mutual funds. Most people have no idea what's in their own mutuals.
316 2019-03-13 21:12:07 Has dropped like rite aid stocks , shit is deplorable
317 2019-03-13 21:11:26 Is story is really interesting!

325 2019-03-13 21:06:56 Hypothetically if you are a stocks trader, would you take a trade to short sell Boeing stocks when the accident happened knowing that the stock is about to fall?
326 2019-03-13 21:06:45 I would advice my fellow traders to buy Boeing stocks
327 2019-03-13 21:06:07 It’s not “stupid”. @jack has banked enough outside of stocks to do his pet projects, like destroy western civilization. What it is, however, is defrauding shareholders.

331 2019-03-13 21:04:12 1,000 plus on any jewelry is a horrible investment in my opinion. The only splurging I’m doing on myself is buying real estate, stocks, and mutual funds. If it don’t allow me to make more money I’m saving my coins
332 2019-03-13 21:04:10 I certainly block people/accounts, but due to retweeting really dumb stuff, or things that I don't want to see (not in the search of confirmation or echo chambering). I just don't like sports on my twitter feed, or stocks or anything like that. That's mostly what I block/mute.

339 2019-03-13 21:00:38 Well if money is only for stocks and shares and stately homes, yes it's spaffing up the wall, but for those of us who hold the welfare of others as even a tiny bit significant it does matter.

I will keep hammering this point again-Nothing works as well as volume at 10:30 AM of > 30% more than previous day. I am not a fan of pure chart pattern purchases although I use it to filter stocks that have strong 52-week uptrending action.

347 2019-03-13 20:56:10 @tbohen why do stocks suddenly start trading intraday when they have not in the past? Like SEEL and AKTX
348 2019-03-13 20:55:47 I hear you. I almost jumped in today but I am getting my ass kicked on other stocks. I know the feeling
349 2019-03-13 20:54:50 @timothysykes 
Why do stocks not trade intraday for months and then suddenly open for intraday trading...AKTX and SEEL for example?

411 2019-03-13 20:28:09 While everyone is talking about a recession, the market is at a 4 month high #stockmarket #stocks #investing #trading
412 2019-03-13 20:27:57 @CrimsonGhost of course I said that this morning resistance from 6 months ago dec murdered all stocks ive been in since jan 2nd
413 2019-03-13 20:27:30 Yeah, again. I get that. But even that is unlikely. It doesn't matter anyway, the guy credited with those rumour says he never said Sony were in any talks with Take-Two. It's fake. Take-Two's stocks likely rose because of the Borderlands 3 teaser.
414 2019-03-13 20:27:04 Im in it. Been watching your calls and the charts makes sense with my small knowledge. Do you teach your stategy or recommend a source to help me get there. I trend trade ETFs and Big cap stocks only now. So I know charts a bit. Want to learn your strategy. Thx
415 2019-03-13 20:26:50 As President he’s rightfully concerned about both the precedent and the economic implications to Boeing and trading of US stocks broadly since Boeing’s stock tends to tightly correlate w the Dow. Especially if it turns out grounding the plane turns out to have been unnecessary.
416 2019-03-13 20:25:51 Does Trump have financial ties to Boeing and Southwest Airlines? Does Trump and or his family hold any stocks in one or both? Is this why it took Trump so long to ground the 737's?
Did he put lives at risk for fear of losing money? 
We won't know unless Trump releases his taxes.
417 2019-03-13 20:25:32 Don't know much about stocks and shares or financial investments but here's a tip, if you have some money stashed away invest it in yellow vest making companies!
418 2019-03-13 20:24:18 No I make money trading stocks my friend. I  use twitter as a journal which forces me to stay honest. I don't really want that much engagement. The more people follow you the harder it becomes as it only needs one smaller fund manager to srew your entries.
419 2019-03-13 20:22:12 I'd rather see David Cameron in stocks with a free supply of spanish tomatoes

422 2019-03-13 20:20:27 I really need to have more knowledge on stocks
423 2019-03-13 20:19:56 I'm starting to think Democrats have all their retirement money in gun mfgr

424 2019-03-13 20:19:41 Every fucking one of them has protected their assets and will be buying up stocks & real estate at fire sale prices after the economic crash they are about to tip the UK into.

The more clever ones are already drawing up plans to privatize every social-serving program they can.
425 2019-03-13 20:19:20 World stocks ex Asia rally: US +.7%; Europe +.6%. Investors becoming convinced growth slowdown won't lead to recession, at least in 2019. S&P 500 creeping closer to lower end of my 2019 closing range of 2880. Market no longer a bargain but now fairly priced. Still upward bias.
426 2019-03-13 20:19:19 It will also benefit boomers long-term. After all, who's going to buy boomers' homes or the stocks in 401K if millennials can't?
427 2019-03-13 20:19:12 That's not a backfire, it's a thought-provoking question asking whether big Wall Street lenders have a duplicitous responsibility for financing expensive & damaging social risks. Given that ESG investment standards already exist for analyzing corporate stocks, it's worth asking.
428 2019-03-13 20:18:57 so daily? got it  , i hope limit sells arent like that, would be nice to set it and forget. Especially for portfolios with larger amounts of assets. Also if i could filter all stocks while searching based on markets , that will be great. But so far so good , im happy...

449 2019-03-13 20:12:28 Bulls stay in control for third day: Stocks end broadly higher despite afternoon pullback. Dow closes +148, +0.6% to 25,702.

S&P and Nasdaq both +0.7%. Winners top losers by about 2 to 1.

Boeing $BA dives after Trump grounds MAX jets, but quickly rebounds to close +0.6%.

465 2019-03-13 20:05:50 I might look like a genius to some as most ideas turned into monster stocks. To tell you the truth it is 95% the markets willingness and 5% my skills. Or maybe 99 and 1.

476 2019-03-13 20:02:03 Yep. Stocks move a lot on news/speculation. Especially in this digital age

479 2019-03-13 20:00:41 Thank you. How do you become a multimillionaire? Create or buy stocks in "green" companies, create a fake "global warming" / "climate change" narrative, cry "the sky is falling", wipe out any competing non "green" companies, cash in when you've created a monopoly.

AVOID credit card debt, overspending on clothes, going out to eat EVERY DAY, too many memberships.

503 2019-03-13 19:53:44 1/2 Structural increase in earnings volatility includes periods of rising P/E and falling P/E, therefore not the driver.  The information content of EPS reports on high P/E vs low P/E stocks is U-shaped (both high and low exhibit excess vol) and dependent on capital structure.
504 2019-03-13 19:52:39 high income clears the way to have diff. income sources which is the key to freedom:  buy/build a piece of equity in a business, some real estate (REITs are a good option), some fixed income (capital protection), some ETFs (good compounder) and some stocks (liquidity and returns)
505 2019-03-13 19:52:24 but aren't they like watershed kingdoms? The first challenger over the hill will liberate their labor force with a piece of cornpone, and then it's just suck up to #Caesar until you can get to #Crete with a jewel or two … leaving nothing but penny stocks behind.
506 2019-03-13 19:51:44 About time to get the Activision stock. That would be 25million per team, now will they do 8 or 16 teams? 8=200million and 16 would be 400million. This is new money on the profits = stocks go up, after a year or so sale off, since this is for the “forever franchise” price.
507 2019-03-13 19:51:28 Congress should take several steps further: revive ban on assault/military style weapons, bump stocks, banana clips, restrict military style ammo from public purchase, interstate sales of ammo.
508 2019-03-13 19:51:10 I would actually be interested to see what large sale sell-offs there were for Boeing as well as Airline stocks in general right before this was announced. I guarantee you they nab a few of Trump's friends for insider trading.

511 2019-03-13 19:49:47 1) Boeing's stocks have fallen 22% - the biggest drop since 9/11 2001. It is plain wrong that President @Trump pressures FAA to close down Boeing MAX flights in the US, when the company says it is safe to fly. MEDIA has whipped a frenzy because UN employees were involved.
512 2019-03-13 19:49:39 Is the reason why it took so long was because he had to move some stocks around?

526 2019-03-13 19:42:00 Boeing is a major manufacturer. So since the prices drop, it would be an ideal time to buy. Once they snuff out the issue, their stocks will rebound.

536 2019-03-13 19:40:03 I just want to bring back the stocks and make it a replacement for Strictly. We can do a UK tour. Opening night Farage and Boris.
537 2019-03-13 19:39:30 Safety takes precedence over stocks any day. Full stop.
538 2019-03-13 19:38:45 @csthetruth So many avenues you could've challenged Laura about 9/11 but you let her get away with, "The Saudis did it, fttt."  I would've smacked her Abel Danger and Abel Destroyer, selling United Airlines stocks short, buildings in free fall including 7. #RedPillBill 
539 2019-03-13 19:37:29 Lets hope this volatile market continues on low cap stocks, when Dek begins his challange and I  Some how I have a feeling this gonna turn out like last time when he begun small account challange, market went off and I almost blew my account.
540 2019-03-13 19:37:24 Only because you were FORCED to. Is it bad that I'm smiling over your tumbling stocks? Seems $$$ is worth more than anything else to you guys.
541 2019-03-13 19:36:32 i've got an innate attraction to never-go-down stocks smh
542 2019-03-13 19:36:21 These cannabis stocks are sumn else man.
543 2019-03-13 19:34:49 Wouldn’t even a diversified mutual fund cause a potential ethical problem?Mutual funds can be diversified and only hold bonds or only stocks. So what if the president for instance had only div stock funds and took action affecting a stock in that fund?
544 2019-03-13 19:34:45 How can we check if the trump family sold off their stocks before he did this?
545 2019-03-13 19:34:19 What are some good stocks to invest in right now?
546 2019-03-13 19:32:32 Twitter stocks rose today...
547 2019-03-13 19:31:52 The S&P500 is trading stronger today, but has come down from the days highs, to be at 2812.0 (+0.72%). What's brown and sticky? A stick. #badjokes #wishIhadbetterones #stocks
548 2019-03-13 19:31:32 While Boeing Canada's stocks has been going nowhere but down for the past 3 yrs.
549 2019-03-13 19:30:53 So, “we” had to wait to move “our” stocks.
550 2019-03-13 19:30:37 Good point. When people think reparations the first option is money. Which is what you’d need to start building in life (buy land, stocks, investments, education etc). We gotta know how to handle that money instead of mishandling it and giving it right back.
551 2019-03-13 19:30:36 I hope they raise the capital gains to 50% only on stocks and index funds purchased on or after today
552 2019-03-13 19:30:35 stocks need to go down!
553 2019-03-13 19:29:20 Boeing’s stocks? 
554 2019-03-13 19:29:15 I see hour chart with stocks that have nice chart for next day but depends on market weather are:
$NFLX
$AMZN
$BA
555 2019-03-13 19:29:12 National marijuana stocks has seen 9-11% monthly increase since the legalization. Yeah way to go, Canada
556 2019-03-13 19:29:09 @StocksToTrade can someone please get back to us re unanswered emails from last Friday. Am paying $300 AU per month for the privilege of having error codes pop up when trying to buy or exit a stock.
557 2019-03-13 19:28:40 Boeing stocks are taking a nose-dive.
558 2019-03-13 19:28:28 Should I disclose I own a stock every time I tweet?  

If I get zero likes - I will stop disclosing what stocks I own on every tweet.
559 2019-03-13 19:27:34 Is this a good time to buy #Boeing stocks?
Askin' for a friend
560 2019-03-13 19:27:29 @SamanthaLaDuc why are investors not buy protection with #VIX financial products at these high levels, you not often see the vix getting higher with stocks at the same time?
561 2019-03-13 19:27:21 "gneu gneu t'es jaloux" après ça vole dans mes stocks de memes
562 2019-03-13 19:26:33 Thats why i brought stocks in #twitter #instagramdown
563 2019-03-13 19:26:25 Parrying often leads to small punishes the same way ps did in past games. Ever since I actively started parrying I've found way more interactions go my way and eventually lead to stocks. You shouldnt instawin because you hit a 3 frame window.
564 2019-03-13 19:25:31 The top 1% now insist that legally we are "leaving without a deal"
"Short" positions on currency,stocks,bonds and other gambles,would ensure huge wealth for hedge fund mgrs, like #PhilipMay if we crash out of the #EU...this is what #Brexit is all about...they're gonna be pissed

567 2019-03-13 19:23:00 + the fact that US & Canada have grounded the plane stocks are plummeting. I wouldn't wanna be CEO ya teng right now
568 2019-03-13 19:22:57 The stocks will be stolen and taken home by all these who are in this so-called period poverty.

Absolute bollocks.
569 2019-03-13 19:22:33 2/2 We need to increase costs on Pak & sink its economy. Get Ambani/Adani to buy Karachi stocks & tank it. Covert actions capability must be built such that the Generals fear for their own and family's lives. @Chellaney
570 2019-03-13 19:21:56 Haha but they can’t buyback the European stocks now as the marked closed with -10,66. 
And probably tomorrow morning it will be free-falling.
571 2019-03-13 19:21:45 False.  The cannabis stocks listed on the NYSE are for foreign companies in countries where it is perfectly legal.  If it were illegal, as you claim, they wouldn't have been able to get listed on the Exchange.  Stop making shit up.  You are just exposing your own ignorance.
572 2019-03-13 19:21:17 boeing stocks down.
573 2019-03-13 19:20:43 Did trump give himself, his family, crooked GOP & Saudis enough time to sell their Boeing stocks so they wouldn’t take a major hit?! That’s the only thing which concerned him. Maybe he can sell Boeing to MBS thru Jared & they’ll pocket a commission?! It’s all about the money!!!!!
574 2019-03-13 19:20:29 Still wanna buy these Delta & AA stocks
575 2019-03-13 19:20:20 Thank you - I waited for it to prove itself on VWAP
576 2019-03-13 19:20:19 Market II: Solid buying in Treasury #bonds, particularly on the long end, is likely good for #stocks. Benchmark 10-yr note yields 2.61%, a YTD low. The #earnings #yield for #sp500 firms, roughly 5.9% vs 2020 earnings estimate, stays robust amid slowing profit growth @IBD_DChung
577 2019-03-13 19:20:03 I know as much as you do, still looking for a link to the news. Regardless, better stocks out there at this point.
578 2019-03-13 19:19:35 If @boeing is using this disaster to buy their stocks back at a lower price and make a profit then it must be investigated!  Sure looks like that is whats happening  #nobuybacks #boeing @RepAdamSchiff @ewarren @SenSchumer @BernieSanders @KamalaHarris
579 2019-03-13 19:19:20 Arguably too soon. Luckily Ethiopia doesn't matter as much so we can say that unlike how we can't say American Airlines' stocks fell harder than the twin towers.
580 2019-03-13 19:18:25 2/2 We need to increase costs on Pak & sink its economy. Get Ambani/Adani to buy Karachi stocks & tank it. Covert actions capability must be built such that the Generals fear for their own and family's lives.
581 2019-03-13 19:18:13 J'ai besoin de toi comme d'une infirmière que tu répares ma tête et mes sentiments qui fonctionnent plus bien 
Que tu refasses mes stocks de sérotonine que tu me dises que c'est rien
582 2019-03-13 19:18:03 under what part of the United States Code?  Most of the top performing cannabis stocks on the NYSE are Canadian companies, which are not under the purview of U.S. law.  U.S. law has no prohibition on invensting in the foreign cannabis industry.  Stop making shit up.
583 2019-03-13 19:17:23 $HEAR how many stocks do you know that can have over 90% of it's OS sold off over the last 10 months and be down only 11% during that time?
584 2019-03-13 19:17:22 Had been dabbling in some stock trading terms but didn't get much further as most information out there is talking in big investments.. would love to see some information in penny stocks trades.
585 2019-03-13 19:17:04 Some body ask me why I don’t make entry for you. I play for myself as enjoying collect 10% to 20% profit or stop around 10% loss. But I have many times to make announcements on stocks with macd moving here. You decide to ride on my announcements.
586 2019-03-13 19:16:53 Nows the time to buy stocks guys
587 2019-03-13 19:16:48 Might have to spend the afternoon ditching my Boeing stocks..
588 2019-03-13 19:16:39 You know you’re officially an Adult when you read a news headline and think “Would hate to be their stocks right now.”
589 2019-03-13 19:16:38 You make it seem like the lions and bears (up til recently) weren’t the laughing stocks of the league. I played New England when they had a perfect season(this decade), you play Detroit(this decade) when they went 0-16. Yet we still have the same win/loss record.
590 2019-03-13 19:15:59 Trump likely has a ton of Boeing stocks that he knows will now drop in value faster & farther.
591 2019-03-13 19:15:42 I really think it is time to be back those stocks in the town square where public officials that acted like prats got rotten tomatoes thrown at them.  Throwing rotten tomatoes sounds like a wonderful stress release behaviour.
592 2019-03-13 19:15:31 Yooooooo @EquityPharaoh is teaching me so much about stocks!! Bro we gotta sit down one day for real and put a plan together
593 2019-03-13 19:15:11 I guess you needed enough time for you and your friends to dump their stocks, yes?
594 2019-03-13 19:15:02 ...The S&P 500 will have to close above the Sept 20, 2018 high before it can officially claim to have lasted a full 10 yrs. At its peak, this bull gained 333%. In the past 10 yrs, while global stocks advanced a respectable 219%, U.S. small-caps led the way, surging nearly 500%...
595 2019-03-13 19:14:51 did you just incorporate stocks into our conversation? is this a marketing scheme???
596 2019-03-13 19:14:22 You say gun control as if trump doesnt want to ban bump stocks
597 2019-03-13 19:14:11 Establish a Central Stores that stocks in bulk commonly used lab reagents & consumables -> let the stores trade in-house w/ Units -> enhance research turnaround time by reducing delayed procurement process.

600 2019-03-13 19:11:13 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
601 2019-03-13 19:10:58 Boeing stocks gotta be dropping right now
602 2019-03-13 19:10:38 I just can't wrap my head around the fact that Boeing stocks have remained largely unaffected in this spectacle
603 2019-03-13 19:10:11 Yeah but I feel the stocks will go down too after this
604 2019-03-13 19:10:06 I use RobinHood. I don’t necessarily follow emerging markets for Penny Stocks, I just look for companies with a low share price and research them to see if they are worth trading. I’ve been learning from @morenitomarcus. His consultations are free.
605 2019-03-13 19:09:59 I agree, they’re not. But they’re still in the space. Which is a good thing because the other stocks have been doing well
606 2019-03-13 19:09:14 Not the stocks. Actual service. IG is down
607 2019-03-13 19:09:11 They had to sell all the stocks to no lose so much money before grounding the planes.. They don't care about people die in crash only care about money

620 2019-03-13 19:03:10 I’ve learned in my short experience of being rich that sometimes yo stocks gonna be down.
621 2019-03-13 19:03:09 I can just hear the stocks deflating every day.
622 2019-03-13 19:03:06 For a $350,000/year (not including stocks and bonuses) for the sale of their soul, the facebook programmers should be able to deal with this a little more swiftly

625 2019-03-13 19:02:43 and the instant a report come out of 50/50 odds of a deal stocks were bought and volatility reversed hard.
Someone put a gun to the algos and kill them forever more
626 2019-03-13 19:02:28 Perhaps if fake money is put into fake investments - buying stocks/shares is not an actual investment, it does not give operative capital to the business - it kinda evens out.
627 2019-03-13 19:01:43 @SouthwestAir @AmericanAir So what is scarier than a MAX8?  President Trump grounding them before you did.
Never ever will I fly with you again. Dumped mutual funds holding your stocks.
628 2019-03-13 19:01:37 The thing is that the guns are only legal when they are directly owned by a legal handler. 
If guns were made illegal for all, then those criminals would still be able to obtain them from either the black market or the weapon stocks that exist.
629 2019-03-13 19:01:21 Check out my new update for some insight, (most recent stock tweet thread) and stay away from Global Stocks and Small Cap stocks in that Vanguard account for now unless it’s less than a 5% stake
630 2019-03-13 19:00:43 Today I learned that the Juventus football team has stocks and operates like a common company.
631 2019-03-13 19:00:42 Trump never was into stocks. Mostly real estate & companies. He did hold a few though, but it is not his core investment.
632 2019-03-13 19:00:27 Did TRUMP BUY AIRLINE STOCKS ? @nfl @EdKrassen @FoxNews @MSNBC @MichaelAvenatti  Need to question everything with him
633 2019-03-13 19:00:05 Bet there has also been sales action on related stocks in cabinet and Trump family portfolios in the last few days. @BoeingCEO @realDonaldTrump #InvestigateTrumpWorld$$$$

636 2019-03-13 18:59:50 What the "F" more do inv who are buying stocks on a trade deal need to now sell?
What the 'F' more do the big banks who caved to Mnunch on 12/26 need?
Time for @federalreserve to give up as well and stop saving stocks while the economy crashes.

639 2019-03-13 18:57:28 You know damn well he had to pull his stocks out of Boeing 1st!! Somewhere/somehow you can bet there was money involved. Since when is the United States of America the last Country to set a precedent?!
640 2019-03-13 18:57:13 Hi, they're £2.00. Available at @derbyquad shop and @formatfestival photo book market while stocks last. Glad you like them!
641 2019-03-13 18:57:05 S&P 500 and Nasdaq new recovery highs today, but small/mid caps, # of new highs, chip stocks, etc., not so much. At least not yet. Overall picture remains very bullish, short-term more up in the air after this week's pop.
642 2019-03-13 18:56:42 Every time my stocks are at a loss, I watch the Wolf of Wall Street Trailer to pick me up.
643 2019-03-13 18:56:42 So in this day and age is it beyond the scope of reason or belief that a multi billion dollar company or country or oligarch would intentionally cause the crash of a competitors aircraft to take advantage of the company’s falling stocks or sales vacuums?
644 2019-03-13 18:56:37 Interesting read, but more money in the market is lost by selling stocks early. Selling when prices are high is theoretical - who know the bottoms or highs.
One does need to keep in mind only one aspect - when the valuations don't add up to potential it is time.

648 2019-03-13 18:54:48 It’s funny I’m pretty left leaning on all topics, but for guns I’m pretty neutral. Don’t get me wrong I believe common sense gun laws are NEEDED and that fully automatic weapons probably shouldn’t be a house hold item, and bump stocks need to go.
649 2019-03-13 18:54:35 Anyone buying southwest airlines stocks?  Theyre cheeeeap
650 2019-03-13 18:53:59 BOEING is about to Go into BANKRUPTCY their STOCKS is Crashing
651 2019-03-13 18:53:55 You know they had to pull their stocks out of Boeing first! This was a forced decision it was not made out of good leadership. Saying publicly that he feels bad for Manafort speaks volumes!!
652 2019-03-13 18:53:54 They could bring back the stocks and all your Twitter followers could throw rotten fruit & veg at them, but it might not make you feel better. 
Were you able to give Police a good description?
653 2019-03-13 18:53:34 Check the stocks he owns. Theres your reason
654 2019-03-13 18:53:18 Just ban semi autos and bump stocks and you’ll solve the problem. Everyone is so stubborn to change these days.
655 2019-03-13 18:53:12 tech stocks gaining, economic data strong, triggering big gains all day today!.
656 2019-03-13 18:53:12 We’ll extend and pretend as long as you all keep buying stocks. The one thing that’s needed to get to a trade deal, is a market crash.
657 2019-03-13 18:53:00 I thought Facebook stocks would go down but they aren’t 
658 2019-03-13 18:52:46 Trading stocks?
659 2019-03-13 18:52:30 We all know he had to pull his stocks out of Boeing first!! Since when is the United States of America THE LAST Country to do the right thing?! We used to lead the world. Saying that he feels bad for an outright criminal speaks volumes!! His actions helped put him there.
660 2019-03-13 18:52:21 Had to wait to announce so cohorts could dump stocks prob
661 2019-03-13 18:51:58 Stocks across the board are getting hit on the Boeing news. One company, BA. I would not be surprised to see a miraculous rebound....
662 2019-03-13 18:51:41 I heard 22 billion dollars vaporized in Boeing stocks so enough money. 

#ThinkPeople
663 2019-03-13 18:51:24 Stocks down. Blame Boeing.
664 2019-03-13 18:51:14 Stocks pulling back as Trump comments hit the wires. "not in a rush" to make deal with China" and announces that 737 Max jets will be grounded. Boeing swoons and Dow the worst hit of the major indices #DJIA
665 2019-03-13 18:51:12 Stocks higher soon after the opening bell. Dow +100 points.
666 2019-03-13 18:50:40 Boeing stocks plummeted.
667 2019-03-13 18:50:17 Trump needed to give time to all his rich buddies to sell their Boeing stocks first. Money trumps everything, even safety.
668 2019-03-13 18:50:10 I have a feeling the delay was due to Boeing stocks.
669 2019-03-13 18:50:10 All my stocks on auto pilot today.  Slow and steady today. See ya all tommo!
670 2019-03-13 18:49:42 Stocks losing altitude on this Boeing news
671 2019-03-13 18:49:34 The amount of liquidity in the financial markets! Stocks, oil, gold!
And bonds unch!!
Really impressive
672 2019-03-13 18:49:21 Stocks rally to new 2018 highs, and here comes a bear's best friend. You. Cannot. Make. This. Up.
673 2019-03-13 18:49:04 That's the reason I am saying: in the future everything will be priced in satoshis! Like all altcoins... Bitcoin will buy stocks, assets, gold/silver. It will be the RESERVE currency. Most trustable money ever.
674 2019-03-13 18:48:54 But you have to give all your rich friends time to sell their Boeing stocks first. Money before safety. Always.
675 2019-03-13 18:48:29 Because the president was busy dumping Boeing stocks first

677 2019-03-13 18:48:14 Nice, point #18 is the reason most folks should index rather than pick stocks, you have to have the big winners to make stocks worthwhile.  That said, I'm not necessarily advocating the indices at these prices, just saying at least the indices capture the big winners.
678 2019-03-13 18:47:18 Guessing Trump sold his Boeing stocks before issuing the order.
679 2019-03-13 18:47:13 It must rebound eventually. Them and airbus have a duopoly.

681 2019-03-13 18:46:16 He had to make time so he could short airline stocks.
682 2019-03-13 18:46:07 Two times I can remember the messages being so polarized. Once was in summer of 2017 and stocks soared. The other was Q4 2018 and stocks sunk. Unfortunately I’m short so hoping for a pull back
683 2019-03-13 18:46:04 I smell a James Bond tupe villain in action shorting stocks today!
684 2019-03-13 18:45:06 $HIIQ Full on bodyslam here. Happens sooner or later for all bubble stocks. Mostly later. But always happens.
685 2019-03-13 18:44:35 Boeing stocks crashing over grounding news.
686 2019-03-13 18:44:30 @AprilDRyan Hope you investigate why we were last to announce this. Was it to give insiders in Trump's time to sell their Boeing stocks first...?
687 2019-03-13 18:44:10 Tjena! Har följt Tim ett tag men inte tagit det där sista klivet. Lust att dra ett pm och berätta lite ur ditt perspektiv hur det fungerar?

689 2019-03-13 18:43:41 The #Boeing737MAX fiasco has already made #Boeing stocks correct by 13% in last 5 days. And now #Trump also orders grounding of #BOEING737MAX8. More correction on the cards.
690 2019-03-13 18:43:36 Boeing stocks plunge over US groundings of planes
691 2019-03-13 18:43:18 Wonder if anyone was short-selling stocks?
692 2019-03-13 18:43:04 Run, Baby, run. The Dem sideshow will only derail even faster. Popcorn stocks on the rise.
693 2019-03-13 18:42:49 $SPY lol so manipulated , that stocks can’t even keep up with the trend . Wait until this has $ROKU type of day
694 2019-03-13 18:42:00 Theory can apply to any and all stocks - there will always be another opportunity - rarely works out to chase
695 2019-03-13 18:41:33 Some people? More or less 90% of your clients/users you mean. This can't be good for the stocks 
696 2019-03-13 18:41:00 Looks like more trouble for BA stocks .... doesn’t Help investors to know that earlier issues before the Ethiopian crash was already indicated
697 2019-03-13 18:40:59 @jimsciutto I hope you investigate how many insiders in Trump's world were allowed to sell their Boeing stocks first... Perhaps that's why we were last to make this announcement
698 2019-03-13 18:40:49 Ca dépend si c’est des stocks de gibier et de saumons séchés...
699 2019-03-13 18:40:48 How many days until we find out the Trumps were shorting transportation stocks this morning?
700 2019-03-13 18:40:07 Global markets slipped on Wednesday after two days of gains amid mounting concern over world growth and trade, as S&P500 futures were coiled around the critical 2,800 "quad top" support level again, European stocks edged higher, and Asian shares declined
701 2019-03-13 18:40:03 Hooray! New York is up tonight!  We should have a strong day tomorrow on the ASX...DOW is up 0.5%, gold is up 0.9% and oil is up 2.5% so sell your homes and buy stocks (just kidd'n)!
702 2019-03-13 18:39:37 The S&P500 is trading pretty well today today, to be at 2818.0 (+0.93%).. Major drivers $PYPL +2.36% and $UNH +2.26%. What's a pirate's favorite birthday? Arghm eighty… #piratejokes #stocks

705 2019-03-13 18:38:23 Should I buy stocks for Boeing?!?
706 2019-03-13 18:38:22 Focus only on the strongest stocks in the market
707 2019-03-13 18:37:48 If this is true the FAA, failed miserably. But the FAA, doesn't even have a head administrator.This is one of the consequences when you don't have proper oversight. The market place can't take care of things proactively. It will now that Boeing stocks have tanked and people died.
708 2019-03-13 18:37:40 Gave them enough time to dump stocks
709 2019-03-13 18:37:35 After how many insiders in Trump's world were allowed to sell their Boeing stocks first...? 
710 2019-03-13 18:36:02 Perhaps, but do you wonder how many insiders in Trump's world were allowed to sell their Boeing stocks first...? 
711 2019-03-13 18:35:39 Today we see investors taking heed, and preparing for the announcement of a US-China trade deal. Investors are buying up stocks and increasing their share holdings for when the announcement is made, which is now extremely close at hand.
712 2019-03-13 18:35:35 Poor data is the worst in decades in every country & in every business. Spending is on consumers who can't borrow more to consume more. Big banks stopped selling on the Mnunch 12/26 save. The bulls believe more fed juice produces another 09-17 run. Stocks will meet data lower
713 2019-03-13 18:35:32 Not sure how they can be sustainable the way they are hammering inshore Wrasse stocks to be used in the cages for lice control
714 2019-03-13 18:35:28 Should've shopped the negative options on Boeing stocks...

715 2019-03-13 18:35:20 Wonder how many insiders in Trump's world were allowed to sell their Boeing stocks first...? 
716 2019-03-13 18:34:50 Wonder how many insiders in Trump's world were allowed to sell their Boeing stocks first...?

721 2019-03-13 18:33:39 I wouldn't want to have Boeing stocks right now.

724 2019-03-13 18:33:19 Rare for this to occur, I think so far it has only affected professional investors. Of course if you are worried, you can buy and hold dividend stocks to take advantage of tax free compounding without needing to rely on capital gains.
725 2019-03-13 18:33:16 How many 1%'ers were allowed to sell their Boeing stocks first...? 
726 2019-03-13 18:33:10 All 737 Max 8 & 9’s grounded in US. Wow. Someone out there shorting airline stocks. Wasn’t this in a Bond movie.
727 2019-03-13 18:33:02 The 2 worst stocks in the S&P 500 today? Discovery and Viacom. $DISCA down nearly 5% and $VIAB down 3% following the news that the revamped DirecTV Now packages will not have channels from those cable networks. Note: DirecTV, like CNN, is now owned by AT&T. $T down nearly 1% too.

733 2019-03-13 18:31:42 Now that all our leaders dumped their stocks it's ok to ground them.

 the fact that small businesses are signaling a slowdown in hiring suggests we may be in for more weak employment reports in the months ahead, a prospect neither stocks nor bonds are discounting at the moment.

Now I been looking at stocks around $6+ and see a lot of them were under a dollar in 2016 eye !!!
749 2019-03-13 18:25:12 Stocks have been up every day since Fed Chair Powell told @60Minutes that there was no reason why solid economic growth couldn't continue for a while and underscored the patience of the FOMC.

Coincidence?

I think not.

762 2019-03-13 18:19:40 I'm actually thinking on picking random stocks in the IRL stock market and assigning them to the in-game stocks. It means there's far more risk involved, but that's a more authentic experience. I like your idea though! I may try to implement it if they attempt day trading.

764 2019-03-13 18:19:26 There is no strategy. Pick top running stocks and then stick to their charts. Today when market opened i saw 3-4 stocks which are top in nifty50 like Hcltech, Hdfcbank, Indusindbank etc. I checked charts and all are looking strong. Then i posted some stocks..
765 2019-03-13 18:19:10 Very cool!
766 2019-03-13 18:18:51 It’s a big enough rumor that Take 2 stocks are rising. It will be interesting to see if it’s true or not.

809 2019-03-13 18:02:33 I’d make it a mix of random rolls (for the stocks), combined with skill rolls by the PCs to choose the right stocks.  Maybe make up a bunch of stocks, have them choose, then they roll a skill check.  Success means you roll twice and choose the best result.

816 2019-03-13 18:01:17 This is a past lawsuit against Boeing to which they responded "auto pilot is irreversible" . Two deadly crashes last weekend involving Boeing brand new jumbo jets. They are grounded in half the world now! Huge $$$ loss! Stocks plummeting! Ouch! Was it their fault? Follow!
817 2019-03-13 18:01:02 basically where somebody listens to the investing podcasts (there aren't all that many yet, but it's a growing number) to scrub out actionable ideas for individual stocks (buy/sell/hold) or sectors/asset classes

827 2019-03-13 17:55:26 Boeing stocks suck, Norwegian airlines wants Boeing to pay for them having to ground the 8’s. And if these black boxes from Ethiopian say what I think they will.. woulda been cheaper to ground them

829 2019-03-13 17:55:02 Apparently it’s sustainable but I don’t think they should be harvesting important wild fish to feed farmed fish. Stocks of Straight of Georgia herring are strong but all herring stocks used to be strong before commercially fished out.
830 2019-03-13 17:54:13 The one where Lord John Krebs said “Although the landing obligation has applied to a number of UK fish stocks since 2015, we heard no evidence that fishers have been complying with it or that any serious attempts have been made to enforce it.”?

837 2019-03-13 17:50:57 One time I went on a date with a guy and my friend came over and commented on how we were discussing stocks at 2 am. So then at that point I realized I how much I actually liked my friend. And now we’re dating
838 2019-03-13 17:50:50 Ok Boeing gets a pass on software failure so all stocks may now explode upward.
839 2019-03-13 17:50:48 I love that I am feeling GREAT holding my few KEY stocks. While my side pile is waiting for action as well, sleepers all around woop.

841 2019-03-13 17:49:57 it's actually the other way round. They never short naked. They are long in stocks and short nifty or any other liquid future. This is still a bullish stance as the beta of indiv stocks is much higher than the nifty.. so if mkt moves up.. stocks move up more than nifty& vicaversa

857 2019-03-13 17:40:58 You’re right. There are regulations that are taking place already.  Bump stocks for example. Again it would be a hell of a leap to do away with guns altogether, and would take years to pass if attempted, if ever.

873 2019-03-13 17:33:27 let's keep an eye on crude because I see it as the initial top indicator with equities following close behind; as impressive as this rally has been you don't see the big gun stocks looking like they want to take out old highs so it's still fake...

875 2019-03-13 17:33:00 I’m a fairly laid back and liberal sort of person but people who don’t wash their hands after they’ve been to the toilet should be put in the stocks.

1075 2019-03-13 16:01:42 Thanks Brian, sounds like the stuff on Seeking Alpha for stocks. It's all about the ad revenue clicks, they'll publish anything, editors only check grammar.
1076 2019-03-13 16:00:37 think in those cases the players themselves know it was a one-off so they try secure a move elsewhere while their stocks are still high

1079 2019-03-13 15:57:16 I’m wrong a lot. But I’m taking some $Labd here. I can’t just look at stocks and get 10-50% every trade but thats happened all year. I’m not that good. Full disclosure I’m also red in this trade too.
1080 2019-03-13 15:56:50 Maybe, or maybe it's because Bitcoin has taken some of the alt investment market share. When stocks go up, BTC goes down, & when stocks go down, BTC goes up. Like it or not, BTC is a real contender.
1081 2019-03-13 15:56:47 And for some students, getting that job post-grad many times equals having to support your family economically, which also puts you behind your white peers because your focus is still your fam instead of bulking up that bank account or stocks
1082 2019-03-13 15:55:25 Bob, do you think that there is a inverse relation between stocks and BTC?
1083 2019-03-13 15:54:43 Strange that algos won't allow $ROKU to participate in this week's rally. It was one of the strongest stocks during last week's fade one fade all.
1084 2019-03-13 15:54:39 Been studying jigsaw during markets hours and tutorials every night since following. In your opinion is orderflow/DOM effective with stocks too; Been trying to figure out but harder with less liquidity in some names. Appreciate all the work you’ve been doing for us
1085 2019-03-13 15:54:22 I need at least 10 racks from stocks this year.

1087 2019-03-13 15:53:58 So what's this about with Trump..stocks, donor $$? There's definitely something that has nothing to do with safety.
1088 2019-03-13 15:53:52 Which of these 3 stocks all trading in the same price range will hit .01 first? $KYNC $ETFM $TRDX. I’m loaded in all.
1089 2019-03-13 15:52:44 if you have not invested $$ in  pot stocks yet...your gonna be sorryyyyy $$$
1090 2019-03-13 15:52:37 Lol worst software and QA out there. Gotta love the power of social media
1091 2019-03-13 15:52:32 According to a NY Times article posted in 2018 (a democratic supported news site) under the orange man we have been progressively having a rise in our stocks and overall average income amongst US Citizens and the national debt has gone down in comparison to Obama.
1092 2019-03-13 15:52:24 "Salt Financial's Low TruBeta US Market ETF, which would trade under the ticker "LSLT", plans to track an index of about 100 low-volatility stocks and will temporarily pay people to invest for at least the first year."

Sounds like a sustainable business model.
1093 2019-03-13 15:52:18 You can have R1 000 000 in your bank account today but it won’t make you a millionaire. Ironically, you would be more “cash rich” than a millionaire whose net worth is probably locked in stocks and bonds.
1094 2019-03-13 15:51:00 I order from a local shop that stocks Kpop albums. I won't buy from Amazon or Walmart (for anything).

1099 2019-03-13 15:48:41 Indian team now behaving like all stocks in a bear market. Regardless of pedigree, chinks start appearing in the armor.

1100 2019-03-13 15:47:15 nah i’d just invest in stocks to get richer
1101 2019-03-13 15:46:55 I was not assuming that, but it's a good thing to think about both.  If stocks rally and economic data is red hot, Fed tightens almost certainly.  If ES > 3,000 would Fed still cut?  What is stocks are high and economic data is luke warm?
1102 2019-03-13 15:46:31 Canna stocks hit $9 today I’m gunna be rich wtf
1103 2019-03-13 15:46:26 Is it too late to bring back the Stocks? That would be an appropriate punishment for Manafort.
1104 2019-03-13 15:46:05 Got about 20 stocks we gotta introduce to the group by Friday.
1105 2019-03-13 15:45:31 well they’d be treated as laughing stocks for saying something like that
1106 2019-03-13 15:45:23 Full disclosure, I'm out of $WWIO. I don't fuck around with stocks when OTCX is on the ask.  I also don't fuck around with stocks that have over 400 mil volume and can't go up 1 tick
1107 2019-03-13 15:44:43 US commercial crude stocks fell 3.9Mb/d. There was no big change in net imports this week.
Gasoline inventories fell by 4.6Mb as refiners ran down winter grade fuels.

1110 2019-03-13 15:44:21 I dream of one day reading an article about cannabis stocks on my computer at work without an unnecessarily large stock photo of a pot leaf taking up half my screen
1111 2019-03-13 15:44:12 Make the comeback like two stocks with SoPo
1112 2019-03-13 15:44:03 I guess the normal train of thought would be a weakening economy translates into weaker growth and earnings dragging stocks down, but in a world where Extraordinary Monetary Policy Tools are continually employed and Global Central Banks erring on the side of accomodation, well...
1113 2019-03-13 15:43:38 Money-power was the first thing I learned in college. While I was working 2 jobs and taking out loans that would take 20 years to repay, my friends were living off of income from family stocks, trust funds, and monthly checks from home. I thought people only lived like that on TV
1114 2019-03-13 15:42:44 natawa naman ako don sa customer kanina while checking the stocks. Biglang kinausap yung PA namin and told her *while looking at my nameplate*

??? Hahahaha pero cutie siya, ganon!!

1116 2019-03-13 15:42:21 It just looks like stocks are screaming "buy" while the indices can't possibly keep going up like this?
1117 2019-03-13 15:41:36 I just want to buy Hello magazine but apparently no store near me stocks it

1120 2019-03-13 15:40:50 My stocks are ramping back up and mortgage rates are down! Yeehaw!
1121 2019-03-13 15:40:44 Joe, the way you pose the question is striking. If the stocks are flying do we assume the economy is too because that doesn't need to be the case.
1122 2019-03-13 15:40:11 Tech Stocks Rise - CNBC says “they may know something” about US-China Trade deal- makes sense, they would know, they are the keepers of human knowledge...
1123 2019-03-13 15:39:49 Yeah, but we just thought it was buying college buildings or transferring stocks. This guy claimed to have helped 700 kids since 2011. Yikes!
1124 2019-03-13 15:39:16 stocks could fly as the economy weakens and the market assumes the Fed will ease making stocks more attractive and a likely benefactor of easier monetary policy as it rejuvenates the economy overtime
1125 2019-03-13 15:39:10 Still in the learning phase. I’m curious what made you look at this stock? Was the positive news the catalyst, or mostly morning price action? Watching all of @timothysykes YouTube before I join silver, but feedback on specific stocks helps too.
1126 2019-03-13 15:39:04 #forex #equities #stocks #bonds #politic all in one = Manipulation ..when you see the #SP500 #spx500 right now and know that mondial economy slowing down,trade war,brexit vote and #US DATA u just want to say fuck to all this big manipulation by the nations who control the world
1127 2019-03-13 15:39:02 I believe if anybody should be raided, it should be the shareholders. They are the total benefactors of these at risk companies and shoulf be held accountable. We must be responsible for the stocks we buy. This would drastically change many things for the good.
1128 2019-03-13 15:38:42 Simple, become a lawyer. Trial is 10x harder than picking stocks lol.
1129 2019-03-13 15:38:31 I would look at Crypto Stocks and find one you feel comfortable with.
See where they are now and where they were at when bitcoin sky rocketed. The ratio favors the stocks at this point.  Start ups with money being invested.  Crypto is more than currency.  Alot of talk about
1130 2019-03-13 15:37:23 Thank you for your response Mark. I am reading and re-reading your books all the time. Your point of view is reassuring for not buying aggressively this week. I'm not seeing new VCP's. Just strong stocks recovering nicely from their pullback.
1131 2019-03-13 15:37:13 Registration we'll be on march 16-april 17 po. Walk ins are allowed din po, only for as long stocks last po. We hope to see you!

1133 2019-03-13 15:36:00 people always say that smash 4 was slow but i still be taking stocks faster in that game than this one.

1134 2019-03-13 15:35:57 This is insanity. We're still in QT (allegedly). We aren't even close to QE yet. The bond market is pricing in a material slowdown. Stocks usually are the last asset class to figure it out though. Total mayhem.
1135 2019-03-13 15:34:54 The S&P500 is trading full of energy today, and currently sits at or near the highs, to be at 2818.0 (+0.93%). Who wants icecream? #icecream #stocks

1139 2019-03-13 15:33:51 Well each person has different metrics to value a company. My “undervalued stocks” may not be your “undervalued stocks”.

1144 2019-03-13 15:32:56 The EIA reported ethanol production 1.005 million barrels per day. Down 190,000 per day from last week. 
Ethanol stocks total 23.7 million barrels. Down 600,000 from last week.
1145 2019-03-13 15:32:50 Exactly.  He oofed there bad.
Homestly he sounds like the stocks guy on CNN it kinda bugs.
1146 2019-03-13 15:32:45 A public scolding? Longing for the days of locking people in stocks and branding people with a Scarlet A? Freak.
Besides, you’re assuming your buddy is clean. There’s been a lot of indictments that suggest otherwise.
1147 2019-03-13 15:32:33 But why would the Fed feel the need to ease if stocks are flying higher?  I guess it’s a question of which comes first.
1148 2019-03-13 15:32:24 Market up nicely but not seeing anything of interest on my screen.  Actually seeing more stocks act poorly.

1152 2019-03-13 15:30:11 What happened to Dicks stocks when they said they after the Parkland shooting they're raising the age limits on sales and they were getting rid of certain rifles? They dropped like a rock in water. With this announcement, it's going to happen again.

1158 2019-03-13 15:28:36 I think you can compare a lot of cryptocurrencies to penny stocks. There are plenty of penny stocks that are scams and go to zero. They have pump and dump newsletters, etc. On the other hand there are a select few penny stocks that go to the moon

1159 2019-03-13 15:28:21 I like it too . But I wonder if it’s one of those junk stocks that just catches a rally in the end . Dunno anyone who uses their product in this day and age

U r not protecting da artist but da stocks
1168 2019-03-13 15:25:38 Actually I believe that even normal stocks should just do a series of crossings instead of continuous trading as well. That is a separate issue though. The amount of weird stuff that they layer on top to negate transmission disadvantage is insane.

1172 2019-03-13 15:22:47 S&P 500:  2,817 on 3/4/19 is the highest level since early October 2018.  A move above that would break the quadruple top chart formation highlighted by market technicians.  At 177.50, Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) is close to breaking above 10/17/18 high of 178.25. #stocks

1178 2019-03-13 15:21:14 Think the "stocks go up in 30-year time frame" is more of an assumption in U.S. capital markets than for the rest of the world

1199 2019-03-13 15:13:28 What you call the anti Tesla cult is normally called the financial literacy. $TSLAQ Out of my stocks, I am highly familiar with some products by Nokia and Kofola only. For most of my stocks, I am not a client or buyer of products. Nothing wrong about it.
1200 2019-03-13 15:13:07 Had to come off the floor to look at my stocks 
1201 2019-03-13 15:12:45 Visiblement, il n’y a plus aucun maillot sur la boutique en ligne, les stocks ont dû être attaqués.. fallait voir le monde à se ruer sur les maillots lors de Rennes - Caen! Chacun veut son maillot de cette saison déjà collector et qui le sera peut être encore plus ... 
1202 2019-03-13 15:12:33 I guess but I haven’t invested $5000 yet and still made $50 in dividends last year. I also like being able to buy partial shares of stocks. For example, Amazon is $1600 per share or so, but I can buy as little as $5 worth.
1203 2019-03-13 15:12:30 For one thing, Trump desperately wants a weaker dollar and will be up their asses all year to make it happen. Personally I think the Fed has already abandoned QT. We've had several days of late where bonds and stocks have rallied together - smoking gun? Maybe.
1204 2019-03-13 15:12:27 Hey, did you and Jason buy stocks in the scrunchies business?  J/K. Lol.  When is Jason going to start selling his own brand of scrunchies?? I will buy one. ;)
1205 2019-03-13 15:11:32 Yeah but how do we get into stocks tho.
1206 2019-03-13 15:11:31 Add to this, I just discovered FFX got tipped in the Torygraph today. Might send them a list of my other stocks to see if they fancy tipping those too. FFX up 10% on the day at present.
1207 2019-03-13 15:11:13 I can’t help but think it goes back to money. Fear of stocks plunging further. Fear of cost to fix in a timely manner. Fear of panic...?!  In a country where big money always wins, I hope we can do better.

1213 2019-03-13 15:08:21 You will get to buy many stocks much cheaper in the next earnings quarter, but will you want to go long in a faked market?
1214 2019-03-13 15:08:09 Thank you, trying to follow your lead on playing it safe - taking singles. Better than a red trade @timothysykes

1219 2019-03-13 15:05:35 This site looks like it is viewing through the lens of more mature cash flowing companies. No jr. explorer is going to look good in that light. That is why this is speculation and not investment. I am a speculator so I am good. I am prepared to lose 50% on some stocks though.
1220 2019-03-13 15:05:26 fixed income could be just relative value against the world; but the others seem to be pricing something else that's supportive (stocks real estate, etc) maybe we've priced too much slowdown and it's not totally monetary policy related
1221 2019-03-13 15:05:08 @dseLIVEtrader Are you adding to your shorts whether index or ind stocks small here as we are back to es 2820 area? Yes I realize we can gert to 2850 or even higher before a turn back down

1238 2019-03-13 14:58:48 Study stocks for a couple months and see how they're trending but also like it's good to have long term goals. I have been in the market slowly adding to my stash for like 2 and a half or 3 years.

Especially Indian funds as the fund Cio managers and traders bonus depends on March closing NAV
1241 2019-03-13 14:58:32 Bonjour, nous sommes navrés, il était bien indiqué "dans la limite des stocks disponibles".
1242 2019-03-13 14:58:07 Indeed, sir. Although right now the dominant theme seems to be "replay of 2016". Bonds are rallying alongside stocks - it has QE written all over it. Need some kind of a negative catalyst to put a stop to this silliness.
1243 2019-03-13 14:58:05 Chicken little. How much have you invested in "green" stocks?

1247 2019-03-13 14:55:48 Ethanol stocks now flipped to -2% year ago
1248 2019-03-13 14:54:11 but most of it hasn't funded government services. It's just driven up the price of stocks & properties, benefiting the already wealthy & impacting the younger, poorer generation. Your children & grandchildren wont be as happy I can guarantee you that
1249 2019-03-13 14:52:48 No, and am sure was some type of lefty and they're hiding it. If was a Conservative, or even a rino, anything at all related to GOP, woulda been in news at least once a week since.  Also, banning bump stocks was and is mistake. Firearms and their accessories aren't our problem.
1250 2019-03-13 14:52:15 This is how I know stocks are out of control. Chipotle’s are unsanitary and unsafe. People that still continue to go there are playing a dangerous game.
1251 2019-03-13 14:52:01 Correct but sadly some people struggle. If you invested the full allowance in ISA’s from start you could easily have £0.5m invested now. It really has been very generous where stocks & shares are concerned.

All the way to what stocks does he own.

1261 2019-03-13 14:49:08 Tweeting about stocks that are suspended is pretty daft but #RRE could proforma 2019 have a 66% Brent & 34% gas mix. Gas been weak but in line with Broker f/c’s but Mararhon is additive to proforma oil mix. See article posted earlier re shale productivity falling. Impt.

1286 2019-03-13 14:36:35 The DOW Jones gained over 100 points in the stock market today partly due to the rising price of the blue chip stocks Apple and Microsoft. Although expensive, blue-chip stocks like these are a fairly safe investment #3500EDGEJACOB
1287 2019-03-13 14:35:41 The number of boats isn't the big limitation, it's the number of fish.  North Sea Cod and Haddock have only recently become a sustainable stock again. The moment we start overfishing, it will collapse. The CFP has, at least, been successful in protecting stocks.

If the lights are on, the doors are open and there's a neon "we are open" sign flashing, can you buy something if there is no merchandise on the shelves?

1328 2019-03-13 14:28:01 Just sent a long email to Bayer explaining why I have jettisoned their products from my cabinets & their stocks from my portfolio. One small maybe insignificant step.  But I feel better by not supporting the supporters of hatred, bigotry, misogyny, etc.
1329 2019-03-13 14:28:01 I shorted the $SPX on Monday into the strength. It was a mistake and I'm wearing it. However, we enter the buyback blackout period next week. I gotta believe that will have an impact + earnings revisions (potential)...I'm gonna stick with it. #stocks

1336 2019-03-13 14:24:07 Trump's mortal enemy is the truth. Lies of omission and comission are his stocks in trade- and those of his supporters. Neither can tell the truth without implicating Trump and his partners in crime.

1338 2019-03-13 14:22:51 Stocks make me so mad. Sold 1800 shares of acb at 8.70 hoping it would dip. Nope went 9.20+. Basically the same thing that happened to me with tilray. Sold at ~70 riiight before it went to 300. I need more patience.

1355 2019-03-13 14:16:07 @DiMartinoBooth digitally. It’s all fake. How come ppl can’t multiply their wealth 10 fold over in ten years?

1356 2019-03-13 14:15:21 Sri Lanka stocks hit a 6 year low, falling by 21% since Jan 2015 and wiping off Rs.710 Billion in value. What measures have been taken by the budget to support capital markets??
1357 2019-03-13 14:15:08 Doesn't that mean bonds ARE buying it?! Fed on hold + trade war truce coming + no inflation = low interest rates and high stocks. No inflation so rates will stay low and only place to invest for any return is equities. I don't like it but don't fight the market.

1360 2019-03-13 14:14:44 So we have all these great stocks. That isn't even half the battle. Holding great stock is about 90%  of it. I own 20% positions in both $YETI and $TME. These stocks fluctuated 5% a couple times in either direction. I have a set of rules that I hold until they are violated
1361 2019-03-13 14:14:37 People get excited to invest whether its RE or stocks and then want to know a guaranteed return figure they should expect. I wish I could see into the future

1368 2019-03-13 14:13:15 Stocks need to get above 2800 and hold. We need a trade deal.  We’re waiting. But the markets need to break this downtrend for the last 14 month. We need a catalyst. That’s ending the trade war.

1370 2019-03-13 14:12:58 Of course I am not Lower Class.  I learned the two most important money-making skills: panning for gold and trading stocks.  Why don't poor people buy a $3 gold pan and head out into the desert and find gold??
1371 2019-03-13 14:12:12 Trading stocks is like riding a bike for me... been doing it for 35 years. That's my passion. Inspiring others is my mission. The success I have achieved makes that possible.
1372 2019-03-13 14:11:26 @IlvesToomas Or stock prices are difficult to compare in different markets. European stocks give a lot less control over the company than American stock.

1374 2019-03-13 14:11:00 Boeing is a business as any other. It's a tragedy that their brand new model suffered that way.But,Boeing to ground 737MAX8 would be a disaster because it would sink their stocks even deeper even though grounding would've been good. It's a conundrum for Boeing

1393 2019-03-13 14:02:03 That's right! We still believe a diversified, low-fee portfolio is the smartest way to grow your money long term.

1394 2019-03-13 14:01:25 I agree completely. Once everyone gets excited about bitcoin again, the average investor will flock to any bitcoin related stocks as they believe it's "easier" to buy than actual bitcoin. I do it easily going over $1 once bitcoin starts to run. $MGTI

1454 2019-03-13 13:35:07 The funny thing is, not much has changed since Friday. #SafeMoney sectors are still blowing the doors off of "growthier" ones. #Treasury prices/yields are still defying the "growth is great" narrative that #stocks seem to be buying into. #Gold is firming back up. And so on.

1459 2019-03-13 13:34:15 Agreed but I think DK might be gone by 17. But, if he is, they can stay or trade back & target guys like Parris Campbell, AJ Brown, Marquise Brown, N’Keal Harry, or Hakeem Butler. All those guys may end up in/around the convo at 17 depending how stocks rise/fall come draft day.

1507 2019-03-13 13:16:25 The US economy averaged 4.4% annual expansion for almost two decades following WWII vs. @realDonaldTrump's 2.4%. 2018 was the 1st year since 2008 that 401(k) owners with 100% invested in US stocks averaged a loss. Pretty basic data points to refute 45's "best economy ever" claim.

1518 2019-03-13 13:09:09 News today
2009 economy repeats
As it did in 1933, 1929

Buying stocks do not stop economic degradation.
Simply uses up cash
Bolsters illusion of stability
Reduces capital upon availability to pay expenses
Rough times come forward
Those who survive
Good luck.

1573 2019-03-13 12:40:31 Totally disappointed with today's sale in Mi Store.. When you knw the demand is high why send only few limited stocks to the Mi Store! Waited n queue to buy N7pro but had to return home empty handed because of no stock.. @manukumarjain @XiaomiIndia #RedmiNote7Pro

1579 2019-03-13 12:39:02 Who are the owners of a majority of stocks? It is 401Ks, IRAs, pension plans and other retirement funds. The beneficiaries are mostly small guys. Insensitivity to this class will further push class warfare and cries for income redistribution.
1580 2019-03-13 12:38:45 Joker, Indian companies like TCS or Reliance valued highly than all the stocks listed in ur exchange. If it was 20bn for Pak it was 100bn for India. for that we didn't have to put up a circus, neither our PM had to become a chauffeur. btw, India got more FDI than China last year.
1581 2019-03-13 12:37:58 Bullshit. Too risky to do such a thing. A multi-million dollar cloud company going to risk their reputation over a game demo? Satya would have to be a moron to allow something like that. MS stocks would die. Sorry but it's real or it doesn't happen on camera. Think about it.
1582 2019-03-13 12:37:58 I am wondering if SEC will check on who take advantage for buying cheap stocks from Boeing
1583 2019-03-13 12:37:26 I'm sorry but I can't let that go without reply Arthur Scargill contributed to more mines closing due to his own far left political ambitions as well as trying to bring the Gov down,his incompetence by calling a strike with coal stocks at their highest he let down 1000s of miners

1588 2019-03-13 12:36:03 Very cool story! Any research showing other examples of the affect a player can have on the clubs stocks?
1589 2019-03-13 12:35:31 That’s anecdotal evidence for you purists. But money going into the non “CPI” basket is not counted as inflationary (real estate, stocks, etc). Money spent by the pure and middle class would certainly drive up inflation until the supply of those items increases.

1597 2019-03-13 12:32:27 Bearish Price action, palpable in nature with stocks leading the rally showing exhaustion, I think it will take some time to do that as shorts are trapped badly
1598 2019-03-13 12:31:59 Two big trends impact high tech industry. 1 Cell phone replacement cycle is slowing down; 2 self driving cars will happen much later than expected. 737max's problem may cause backlash on over-automation. The chip stocks are overvalued. $mu $nvda.

1606 2019-03-13 12:28:57 I'm confused why people are obsessed with stocks. Decreasing of stocks just means that there's less profit. "Profit" okay? Meaning, they've already reached the breakeven point. That doesn't mean, the company will automatically face bankruptcy.
1607 2019-03-13 12:28:11 I’m torn on this. It makes sense to ground them while you’re investigating it, yes, but the scare of the US not trusting its own planes would cause the airline industry’s stocks to go down, which would absolutely destroy the economy of the city I live in overnight.
1608 2019-03-13 12:27:05 He thinks he’s an expert on everything from the cloud to data centers to gene editing etc. He does nothing but pump the stock market. So what we leaned in school about economics/business cycles etc means nothing, bc according to him stocks should never go down or are nvr overvald

1614 2019-03-13 12:24:04 really diggin gettin into stocks. already made some money of the minor investments ive made. feels good man.

1620 2019-03-13 12:19:47 $XLK (18.14 PE), $XLC (18.62 PE) both sport higher valuation than $SPY (16x)

#XLK has lower growth estimates for '19 (2.7% vs. 4% for $SPY).  Seems dangerous.  
Your paying higher valuatios for lower growth!

We favor high quality stocks with above avg growth.

1625 2019-03-13 12:17:08 #s#caringcapitalist on #stocks would like to point out that ringcentral (RNG) had a 2019 sustainability raking of 74 out 100 with a 2018 total return of 70.3%.
You're welcome!
1626 2019-03-13 12:16:31 looooooooooooool i’m cryingggggg ‘our stocks are falling’ ‘ahhh peak’
1627 2019-03-13 12:15:58 Could you direct me to that forecast please? 

You see, we import over 50% of our cod and haddock.  The UK fleet cannot fill that gap and maintain them viable sustainable stocks in the North Sea. So, supply will reduce and prices will go up.
1628 2019-03-13 12:15:28 Only true if we’re talking about currency on a gold standard - which no country has used since 1971. Like stocks, they’re valuable because we agree they’re valuable - also subject to bubbles, so just as infinite as lives that take 9 months to gestate.
1629 2019-03-13 12:14:56 You can't get a kickback on a cut like Social Security (disability benefits? WTF!). You can get a kickback on increasing military spending, at least on your stocks (check the portfolio). Guns over butter with no comparable enemy in sight! INSANE

1634 2019-03-13 12:12:31 Haaaa thanks. I gotta be careful though, I work in an office, and although I work in tech, in has nothing to do with crypto. Sometimes people see a chart on a screen and go "How's the stocks doing today eh?"

1643 2019-03-13 12:06:22 similar. Wall Street doesn’t dictate the state of the economy in the 21st century. Stocks increasing today has less to do with the wellbeing of the people and country and a lot more to do with what puts more money into the pockets of brokers and shareholders. Businesses doing
1644 2019-03-13 12:06:10 I'm not so sure.. Many of the #NSDQ stocks will be sold to buy these Newbies and several of these Newbies look like Dogs. The #QQQ might take a big hit and then slowly recover over the following year or two

1647 2019-03-13 12:04:18 Funny stuff.
Simple truth is we have the best stock mrkt ever in exchange for:
-Worst recovery ever in GDP, Housings & Autos
-Highest debts & lowest savings ever
-Highest inequality + strongest wealth for elites
Now @federalreserve wants to buy assets & use NIRP to to fix stocks
1648 2019-03-13 12:04:09 Yep if your splitting corn stocks like we do it gives you more room for wonder with out riding up on root balls .. also will sit down in tire tracks or ruts better for better depth control on those situations
1649 2019-03-13 12:03:24 People who don't know about financing and how these penny stocks really work . buy into the story and usually get caught holding a dead ticker for months and sometimes years.

1660 2019-03-13 11:59:29 The most important thing is where can they get the financing they need, besides, Tech firms may not be appreciated by us African, that may affect the IPO, and the price of the stocks later, but in the U.S the expectation is higher
1661 2019-03-13 11:59:26 Yes I understand P/E ratios and differences between growth and value stocks but saying “no massive growth” expected for GM is an understatement. I’d be very concerned about it’s shrinking market share.  A really fascinating war between old and new, big and small is taking place.
1662 2019-03-13 11:58:46 Is the market considered the crowd or is it more latest hot stocks??

1698 2019-03-13 11:32:06 Actually their business model is so weird that they cannot afford to produce massive stocks of phone. They aren't witholding. 
Part the reason the phone is so cheap is that they don't have to pay for inventory management or a godown to hold the stocks.
1699 2019-03-13 11:31:01 1) I have been thinking about how best to deal with those who brought about Brexit. I reckon we put them all in stocks, silenced in a way so they cannot utter another filthy lie ever again in their entire life, a "radical truth" order. (see footnote at the end of this thread).

1735 2019-03-13 11:07:50 But it’s ultimately the same thing. Either way they are giving money to a company for them to do the work. If that’s the line, then if you buy stocks in Tesla and find out it’s caused environmental damage, should you as the s/h be liable for the cleanup?

1737 2019-03-13 11:07:46 The "zoom out" (destination) should not be passively solidified with stocks of today's knowledge. It should be dynamically rebuilt on the flows of future knowledge.

1756 2019-03-13 10:54:06 Union budget says annual expenditure in excess of Rs 27 lakh crores. Yet, this government is raising money by selling PSU stocks to raise paltry sum amounting to Rs 3,000 crores. This is about 0.1% of budget. Government has no clue about innovative ways to raise revenue.

1760 2019-03-13 10:49:51 Sort of like allowing someone to borrow stock you own so they can turn around and short it, am I right?  If so, why would anyone who owns 
gold/stocks encourage someone else to lease/short it knowing that drives price lower? It’s against their interest. Not worth the few % gained

2063 2019-03-13 06:46:20 Asi es. Pero lo mas importante, incluso más que el Bigdata o learning: un dominio completo de lo que significa (in)coherencia financiera en stocks y flujos de una actividad económica. Sin eso,  lo que tienes es simios atrás de un algoritmo en un ordenador.

2067 2019-03-13 06:45:33 Market bounced back into positive territory after soft opening. Private banks and Select tech stocks lead the market rally. However, mid-cap Index are in the red on account of profit booking. NSE 500 stocks advance decline ratio are not favourable. #MOMarketUpdates

2071 2019-03-13 06:44:24 Hi, we understand your disappointment. Since sellers have great offers and discounts during the sale, products may run out of stock really quick. In case you like a product, we'd recommend that you buy it while the stocks are available with sellers. (1/2)
2072 2019-03-13 06:43:34 apple stocks rise by 20%.
2073 2019-03-13 06:43:26 Going out of stock in seconds leaves many anticipated customers go angry.
I feel stocks should atleast last for five minutes even the product has this demand.

2075 2019-03-13 06:42:38 Didn't catch that particular post but yeah relying on spec stocks to finance a house purchase is inherently going to be risky since specs are so volatile and rely so much on sentiment 

It's just that in context of bear market, share price can become SOLE FOCUS too much of time

2175 2019-03-13 05:13:06 I think because naver true intentions is to distract knetz from the s*ungri scandal. YG own part of naver stocks after all. If they put BTS achievement news, let say stadium tour or BTS impact on SK economic on main page, it will only benefit BTS and BH not naver or YG

2201 2019-03-13 04:49:19 I don't think most of them are in over-valued zone, so many stocks are so badly beaten up, they have just given 25-30% recovery from lows, if you compare from highs they are way way off even now.
2202 2019-03-13 04:49:10 Any Conservative with a @CapitalOne Credit card or stock, needs to call & cancel it or in the case of Stocks sell them...
2203 2019-03-13 04:48:35 Ok, Google the following term.  "Price to Earnings Ratio".  What this term means is that all stocks, bonds, and other investments are effectively priced based upon what the investors expect to get back each quarter.  Of they get nothing, the price falls to nothing.

2205 2019-03-13 04:46:26 It's not for the rich, I'm not rich and I have an investment account. My parents aren't rich and they can retire because they have an investment account. WTF are you talking about? Do you not know what stocks are?
2206 2019-03-13 04:46:21 Honestly think we should go back to public embarrassment for people. If they’re caught they’re jailed but during times of the day they are put in stocks so the public can ridicule them and throw tomatos like the founding fathers envisioned when they created America!
2207 2019-03-13 04:46:09 The thing is...plenty of charts and stocks to be bearish on. Just stop shorting cloud kings and getting run over for 8 weeks.

2215 2019-03-13 04:38:18 Employment options (having employee's), having like advertiseing stuff and stocks, having an actual effect on economy if your buissness succeeds and of course a way to fail at buissness 
2216 2019-03-13 04:36:52 I might invest into some stocks this year
2217 2019-03-13 04:36:22 So ummm why are SM’s stocks dropping?
2218 2019-03-13 04:36:22 Even there were profit booking in many stocks yesterday while index was raising. Typical technique.

2227 2019-03-13 04:25:24 Worst mistake you could ever make. Along with banning the bump stocks, gun owners in CA need to rise up and elect another governor, because this governor is surely not helping citizens who believe in the 2nd Amendment. Obviously this governor doesn't respect the Constitution.
2228 2019-03-13 04:24:50 @Jestonsapp 

I also sell covered calls against my stocks, or sometimes hedge them or lever them up

But I don’t gamble everyday

2234 2019-03-13 04:19:03 this is all damage control at this point of time to appease investors and keep their stocks from diving further. when our other 4 are discharged i'm sure they will work something out.
2235 2019-03-13 04:18:59 Don't play the penny stocks.
2236 2019-03-13 04:18:35 he released the most fake and superficial statement ever and suddenly his stocks are increasing again???? that's bs
2237 2019-03-13 04:18:18 Physician earnings are complex ranging from entrepreneur to salaried.   But Dean is talking net income.  Yes, med school is expensive, but time & money are investments in future earnings just like stocks.  PS other professionals pay liability premiums too.

2239 2019-03-13 04:16:59 Easy to stay when mist stocks are up over 15%.
2240 2019-03-13 04:16:52 everyone’s surprised that naver holds stocks in yg? armys been knew this, i honestly thought it was common knowledge
2241 2019-03-13 04:16:09 Very happy that my stocks are going up even when the economy is in shambles and corporate earnings are likely to be very weak. 

Will use this rally as a great opportunity to book some profits in next few weeks ahead of q4 results.
2242 2019-03-13 04:15:31 they needed to experience many bad things first like wtf? LVMH possibility of not being an investor anymore, Seungri's scandals, and drop of stocks, they all needed this before they realized how shitty their management is and I hope YG will realize how misogynistic he is!

2248 2019-03-13 04:13:23 They most invest in High cash flow generating businesses and financials. And its fun trading FII's stocks. They give great moves. Even on the short side, the way they dump stocks is fantastic

2264 2019-03-13 04:04:05 For BIGBANG and VIPs its 5 or 0
For YG and stocks its??

2269 2019-03-13 04:01:19 Bump stocks are basically a toy. They are impractical for any serious application. The Mexican drug cartels or whoever you imagine would be the buyers use full auto machineguns. They can convert any semi-auto to full-auto easily. They would have no use for 14 bump stocks.
2270 2019-03-13 04:01:09 They only did it because their biggest investor bailed + their stocks forecast are pretty bad
2271 2019-03-13 04:00:06 the sudden increase in YGs stocks after the news wow

2273 2019-03-13 03:58:42 Not every strategy works at any given time. Example. Some traders tell you to do away with stocks that are not participating when the markets are in full rally mode.

2) VIX Chart
3) Volume Buzz (TC2000 indicator)
4) % of stocks trading above their 40-day moving average
5) NYSE Advance/Decline Breadth

2291 2019-03-13 03:39:51 Depends on the quality of the project- but I would say there’s plenty of coins to go around. We need to fund business startups and use tokens in place of stocks and bonds.

2298 2019-03-13 03:35:13 It is symbolic of the arrow shots in the air that these buyback orgy stocks look like now only way down now is straight down imho
2299 2019-03-13 03:34:49 Most likely to go down from today in small chunks though...no big moves
2300 2019-03-13 03:34:28 My sister lives in Switzerland and stocks up on cosmetics, clothes, etc while visiting the US. It has nothing to do with the govt.  A lot of goods are cheaper here.

S*it my hopes are gone in to Ganga river....
2303 2019-03-13 03:33:17 @Plus500 im on demo mode, why don't I have access to all stocks. Iv entered several ticker codes as suggested by Tim Sykes and none work. having access to more on the table would be helpful to the learning process.
2304 2019-03-13 03:32:57 can the cowboys just give dak 30 mill a year already so we aren’t the laughing the stocks of the league anymore
2305 2019-03-13 03:31:48 Morgan. Your a dope smoker aren’t you? .  Food stamps down = bad.  . Are you still in college?  When you get a real job and start your 401K you will be buying stocks.  Your financial advisor will suggest you invest regularly. Buy a house and invest. Maybe retire someday.
2306 2019-03-13 03:30:23 There were not bump stocks used.
2307 2019-03-13 03:28:49 On another front...think of how many share of 275 cannabis stocks I could buy at one mill each!!

2323 2019-03-13 03:16:04 Then you have the lower tax thrust of the Coalition which means making it harder to balance the books.

Plus of course, much of that Super is tied up in stocks and shares. Market collapse will render many in future strife.

2326 2019-03-13 03:14:17 I think sm still concerns about their stock. If they don't denying that article sooner they let *uncertainty fills in the market = public/fans divided opinion > investors to pull out their money/switch to other stocks until they resolve the problem

my sister: what the f*ck are stocks? shut the f*ck up -clicks to a new photo- he’s wearing a hat
2330 2019-03-13 03:12:48 I also firmly believe that if you had only bought the highest returning stocks and did nothing else, you would have beaten the market handsomely.

2403 2019-03-13 02:34:45 In my newbie-investor viewpoint (disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor) I have seen lots of stocks that are undervalued and I bought, and subsequently did well when lots of other stuff was down. I think it needs assessment on a case by case basis.

2424 2019-03-13 02:21:11 let me have the coils and take my stocks lol
2425 2019-03-13 02:20:52 Stocks a lil cheap but they still high 
2426 2019-03-13 02:20:44 Not bad, but probably better buys out there in individual stocks.

I’m going to dig deeper into BX.

In the meantime, check out $AAL, $GT, $NWL, $CVS, and $ADS
2427 2019-03-13 02:20:16 That is probably why their profit and stocks keep falling.  At this rate they will be out of business soon.  Yet, Field and Stream, owned by same people, continue to sale firearms and profit.
2428 2019-03-13 02:19:36 Yep, you need to trade what you have a good feel for. There are good stocks that I stay away from, simply based on it would drive me bonkers just to watch them! Good news of course is, don't need them all to profit.
2429 2019-03-13 02:19:30 Psei -0.17% at 7,734.01

2431 2019-03-13 02:17:36 I swear SM stocks were beginning to drop at that time 
2432 2019-03-13 02:17:18 A lot of it is antis not exo-ls but honestly I genuinely don’t think SM would’ve cared considering they’ve made it clear in the past they don’t care ab Seh*n but with their stocks falling so much they need to be as far away from this scandal as possible
2433 2019-03-13 02:16:42 Should of invested money in the Muck Boot Company! Stocks would of probably doubled this winter!
2434 2019-03-13 02:15:14 Guys, sorry but we’ll be getting stocks from a supplier since mas mura talaga :( we won’t buy directly from bighit so we can’t avail of the special gift since exclusive sa bighit shop lang yun
2435 2019-03-13 02:14:40 $SPX (S&P 500) to retrace bearish trend tomorrow. Possible shot up to resistance at 2800 but definitely bearish activity. #stocks #stockstowatch #spx #stocktrading
2436 2019-03-13 02:14:12 I was laughing at how fast SM responded to this, but the truth is, they had to. Entertainment companies' stocks have dropped overall due to the scandal/criminal investigations in SK. They can't afford to have their share-holders panic over possibly losing D.O.
2437 2019-03-13 02:13:44 of course sm's gonna deny it immediately who's going to pay the bills if their stocks go down
2438 2019-03-13 02:13:37 I was about to do a longer list of healthcare stocks that I had never heard of. This one stood out so much I fell in love right away.
2439 2019-03-13 02:13:29 With all that's happening around the 737-MAX series, now is probably the best time to buy Boeing stocks. Rationally, one would expect a big company like Boeing to take measures, and be back up in weeks. 
#Boeing #Stocks
2440 2019-03-13 02:13:28 They didn’t want exol to leave their wallets was probably already hurting and people were about to sell those stocks like hot cakes
2441 2019-03-13 02:12:44 Being able to do more to affect your company stocks would be cool, also, t.v. and print commercials to sell product would be cool
2442 2019-03-13 02:11:36 U.S. stocks closed mixed on Tuesday, 03/12/2019 $DJIA -0.38% (-96.2) at 25,554.66 $SPX +0.30% (+8.2) at 2,791.52, $COMPQ +0.44% (+32.9) at 7,591.03.
2443 2019-03-13 02:10:29 Honestly SM actually defending Seh*n was the shock of a lifetime, like they act like he’s invisible 90% of the time, but I’m sure they also have to do damage control considering how much they’re stocks have fallen recently
2444 2019-03-13 02:10:28 SM's stocks has been decreasing for a while so they are trying their best to save it
2445 2019-03-13 02:10:07 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
2446 2019-03-13 02:09:30 oh shit dow j is droppin in the stocks
2447 2019-03-13 02:09:04 20 stocks should cut 80% of diversifable risk.

2454 2019-03-13 02:06:34 They are. It's literally like the weird mobs that sit around attacking people in pillories or stocks, even if there was no evidence (they were just poor)
2455 2019-03-13 02:05:54 SM denied it so fast like they had to protect their stocks asap
2456 2019-03-13 02:05:52 Over-Diversification = mediocrity. You only need something like 50 stocks to diversify away 90% of unsystematic risk.
2457 2019-03-13 02:05:40 Yeappppp....all for posting a chart on his crashing stocks....Give me a break 
2458 2019-03-13 02:05:12 It is often hard to be optimistic and hang on to good mining stocks given that the sector overall calls for extreme skepticism and caution most of the time (95% are stinkers that are bound to fail). Also important to spot if revaluation case turns into a momentum stock.
2459 2019-03-13 02:04:33 Several stocks and the ASX200 showing RSI divergence.. warning signs that a correction is on the cards !!

2465 2019-03-13 02:00:02 SM acts so fast on this issue. Did SM stocks suddenly go down? 
2466 2019-03-13 01:59:17 Not gonna lie. It’s treating me just fine. Stocks are up. Taxes are down. Healthcare still sick. Otherwise can’t complain. Just happy Hillary isn’t at 1600 Penn. Sad about Rep Omar continuing to embarrass herself & the country with her tweets of ignorance. But what ya gonna do?
2467 2019-03-13 01:58:49 @MarketFoolery Listened to last Friday’s show on food delivery stocks & intrigued. It’s a crowded space but appears fragmented & driven by demand. Thoughts on $WTRH? Seems under-the-radar & wasn’t mentioned on podcsst. Company recently acquired BiteSquad. Looks cheap. #AskAbi
2468 2019-03-13 01:56:33 Aka DO wants his rights but SME trying to give him the bare minimal, he's thinking of leaving shthole, news appear, SME panicked because they know DO is a treasure -> SME : "what??? No??? He's not leaving gonna negotiate with him more to give some new details, stocks wait up"
2469 2019-03-13 01:55:55 I am hoping to see a sympathy type effect as Lyft and Uber IPO, seeing more of these type of stocks running in sympathy going forward into the future creating more plays in the market. Such as when the shippers run together. More opportunities. Could be good for $DCAR? Thoughts?
2470 2019-03-13 01:55:28 Any stocks you have your eye on?
2471 2019-03-13 01:55:12 Hi I’m from Florida I got a liberal arts degree I don’t understand conference, banking, stocks, accounting, tax code or anything that requires intelligence. And I like cats which by definition makes me a ********.
2472 2019-03-13 01:54:10 So in less than one week we have:

1. Drop in YG stocks
2. Johnny Depp lawsuit against Amber
3. Kyungsoo reportedly leaving SM
4. SM saying that’s a lie

What is even happening. . .
2473 2019-03-13 01:53:40 Do you still have any extra stocks for Vivace ver of DMUMT?
2474 2019-03-13 01:53:37 I’m not buying any products, cancelling amazon prime, selling stocks in any company that advertises w that asshole! And I’m pissed bc I was just about to buy a new Rx350 but it’s a Toyota product right?!?! Please tell me it’s ok?!?!and I’m far from the only one! Fox sucks!
2475 2019-03-13 01:53:36 That and the car companies making things cheaply so the auto parts store stocks that specific part like PLASTIC heater core fitting that should be metal.
2476 2019-03-13 01:53:21 @AlertTrade stick to stocks not politics please.

2481 2019-03-13 01:50:37 SM never dropped a statement this fast, afraid their stocks might be goin down i guess...EXO power..
2482 2019-03-13 01:49:47 *looks around* their stocks *hides*
2483 2019-03-13 01:49:32 I never thought I would say this but Seungri fucked over kpop. Stocks plummetted and everyone is salty and fighting. Fandoms are against fandoms and friends are against friends.
2484 2019-03-13 01:49:23 A sharp reversal in market breadth from oversold to overbought zone in a very short span is a rare phenomenon. 

This, along with fact that over 50%stocks have shown trend breakouts, is something quite rare in Indian context. This suggests that market may be in for a sharp rally.
2485 2019-03-13 01:49:00 EXO-L SHOULD START BUYING STOCKS AT SM!!!
2486 2019-03-13 01:48:51 I found them on stocks and the first ones I posted

2490 2019-03-13 01:46:50 kerries need to buy stocks from SM just like what elfs did that's why they don't fuck over SJ anymore
2491 2019-03-13 01:46:47 Why continue? Down two stocks when you're only at 20% Playing someone that far outside of your skill gap does more harm than good.
2492 2019-03-13 01:46:41 Because I think folks who intentionally don't vote should be put in stocks and have (very soft) tomatoes thrown at them, I may lose some followers. Good riddance.

Because there are folks who shirk their responsibility to all of us by not voting, I have to vote twice!
2493 2019-03-13 01:46:36 Company now caps me at +2% of the company average which reduces my current spending %. Where should I now put the “extra” money？ Start up Roth？ Stocks？？？
2494 2019-03-13 01:45:39 My friend just brought this one up yesterday while hiking. He’s not even invested in mj stocks at all yet. What’s special here, anything?

2499 2019-03-13 01:41:35 Perfect trade is mostly (99.99%) in hindsight - always. $TLRY was my most lucrative trade if you take into account the time span - other than that I have not been able to maximize my gains on any other meteorically risen stocks. Wish we can have $VFF as TLRY v2.0 :)

2501 2019-03-13 01:37:57 now it makes sense why they banned the short selling of stocks. bc they know that their company is full of dirty bastards and since the investigation is already on a nat'l level n the entire country's eyes are on them, they expected dirt after dirt to be dugged out. that's why...
2502 2019-03-13 01:37:53 the cloud left after I beat him (go figure. No such thing as a respectable cloud main) and the next guy ragequit after 2 stocks
2503 2019-03-13 01:37:37 It is far better to have too tall a pile of "too hard" stocks than to have purchased too many stocks that you don't have enough conviction to hold through thick and thin because you don't sufficienting understanding of the company.
2504 2019-03-13 01:36:30 It’s hard to feel that way and you’re a giants fan I’m drowsy  so you trade Odell for picks then get Jabril Peppers!? Like who TF are you dude? Surely no Odell Beckham caliber of a player defensively. Dude my Knicks & Giants are laughing stocks atm.
2505 2019-03-13 01:36:27 I wish you could invest in Google searches like you can in stocks because my money is on the hoardes of 20-somethings typing in “Air Supply” RN #TheBachelor
2506 2019-03-13 01:35:37 we just talked about how the seungri incident affected the fundamentals of the industry hence worsened the stocks of all big3 and sm saw 10%? down in their stock price already
2507 2019-03-13 01:35:19 Mine too and I’m patient generally
2508 2019-03-13 01:34:11 we'd time people out playing 2 stocks in smash 4
2509 2019-03-13 01:33:43 Maybe that’s why SM’s stocks dropped so drastically the other day..?
2510 2019-03-13 01:33:10 Yes, there are growth stocks and dividend stocks, but not all companies do that. How many dont pay taxes?
2511 2019-03-13 01:32:34 Tim that is just wishful thinking on your part. Higher tax rates do not equal more civic minded rich folks, just means more tax shelters and foreign bank accounts and money in stocks not banks. I wish you were correct but human nature and history suggests otherwise
2512 2019-03-13 01:31:35 Dec.18 2018 @realDonaldTrump banned bump stocks.  Why do we need Nevada to write another ban?  Seems our State Legislature needs to wake the fuck up

2514 2019-03-13 01:30:57 With all due deference, none of my loved ones are in stocks. The older ones won't have time required to recoup their losses. The "you can't time the markets" meme is propagated by the buy-and-hold sell-side herd as it's their job. That doesn't make it mine. Let's leave it at that
2515 2019-03-13 01:28:40 @PlayApex "I need to have a better barrel" This can go on Armor, Helmet, Barrels, Mags, Stocks, and Sights. I think this would be a very good addition to make the ping system more viable than it already is. Thanks for reading! 2/2
2516 2019-03-13 01:28:40 If only YG pushes through with Mixnine then their stocks will somehow get stable.

2519 2019-03-13 01:26:43 One thing I've noticed is that online I get antsy for early kills and get greedy early on

In IRL brackets I get antsy for last stock kills and get greedy when I'm down stocks

Funny how that stuff works!

Wanna fix both blehhh

2521 2019-03-13 01:26:35 Wow, that’s a little different than the shorts we are used to in mj stocks 
2522 2019-03-13 01:25:59 Today they were closed and it seems that tomorrow they will stay closed.

That's really worrisome, but I'm more worried about the stocks in the stores, a lot of people probably ran short of food during this whole issue.
2523 2019-03-13 01:25:36 STOP !!!

It is NOT the responsibility of 

1) the bank (who lends the money to the bar owner) or 

2) the building owner (who leases the bar the space), or 

3) the liquor distributor (who stocks the bar), etc. 

when a bartender over-serves a patron.

And you know that !!

2534 2019-03-13 01:20:26 They are, but the stock market smells more easy money from the Fed. That shouldn't be a reason for stocks to rally.

2536 2019-03-13 01:20:05 For as frighteningly horrid as I am at taking my own advice, please actually consider the fact that I know what I'm talking about when I say that if you're taking games or stocks off of top players, that's GROWTH. If you're beating players in matchups you don't know yet, GROWTH.

2552 2019-03-13 01:12:04 Market Is Overreacting? Most stocks are fragile, far over valued. 2 crashes of latest model planes within 5 months would be hard for travelers to swallow. Is it due to inherent design or tech error? The precarious markets quickly react, no surprise. Boeing must be transparent..

2555 2019-03-13 01:09:34 One thing to watch out for investing in marijuana cryptocurrency and stocks. Guess what? State legal, federal illegal. And alot of growers growing now so pot is going to drop per ounce significantly because of competition. Be careful.
2556 2019-03-13 01:09:01 We need to overgrow America and watch all these stocks go down the tubes. Big business and big Pharma been the enemy of our plant now they want to cash in on it.

2560 2019-03-13 01:05:16 Do you think I’ll double my $500 account within the 7 day @StocksToTrade trial ? 
2561 2019-03-13 01:04:18 The answer is always money. I read this morning that “stocks”for Air Canada and  Westjet dropped as a result. WHO CARES. Are shareholders really going to decide who lives and who perishes in these horrible, preventable accidents?
2562 2019-03-13 01:04:06 Lol ! Really ? Do the same with winners just to see. Haha really the funniest I havent seen in a while.  In options you just have to win more that you lose, to be honest, nobody is always right because stocks doesnt move only a technicals.. but good work kid..
2563 2019-03-13 01:03:20 I’ll be cancelling my prime subscription, not buying Toyota product which I planned in 2 months, sell stocks in companies DONE!

2565 2019-03-13 01:02:13 Glad to know. What is your view on Immune pharmaceutical. The IMNPQ stocks.. Are heading to trash bin or there is some real restoration being worked under their chapter 11?
2566 2019-03-13 01:00:53 Just came out of my office belting some Elton John while there was still a customer in the bank, in other news TD stocks rise by a billion percent #Performer #Ad
2567 2019-03-13 00:58:33 I hate games on NHL Network.  That stupid ticker tape of scores that run across the bottom of the screen drive me nuts.  Its like watching the news when the stocks scroll on the bottom
2568 2019-03-13 00:58:24 Doubling down on my medical equipment company stocks. #cardiovascular #cholesterol
2569 2019-03-13 00:57:33 Kind of like how 75% of stocks are grossly undervalued according to sell side analysts
2570 2019-03-13 00:53:54 Reading YG's status, stocks and everything. Things you'll notice in the comment.
- Blinks saying to leave YG cause they're the one who can save YG ent
- Armys and others saying YG gonna go bankcrupt and fall down
- diff concern stan thinking of artist welfare.

2575 2019-03-13 00:49:54 *invests in balsa wood stocks*
2576 2019-03-13 00:49:41 Corn & wheat stocks are huge, ethanol demand for corn is soft, exports of corn and ethanol are soft.  El nino is very likely.  Funds are going to be short corn until something big happens
2577 2019-03-13 00:47:57 People said I was dumb after getting season tickets after 0-16. I'M A GOD DAMN VISIONARY (invest in weed stocks)
2578 2019-03-13 00:46:32 Nope still no stocks. Not even planned atm. Just check the Changelogs in the link to see all changes for the update.
2579 2019-03-13 00:45:41 U.S. Stocks extend rally?
2580 2019-03-13 00:44:25 As a Browns fan, I'm hoping we don't solely win the offseason. This has to translate into success.

Ever since Dorsey came in as the GM, the stocks have risen.

Can't wait to watch my team play in January. If all goes well, I can say that about February too.
2581 2019-03-13 00:44:23 computer, cell phone, stocks
2582 2019-03-13 00:44:00 Always remember this. Stock returns are different from business returns. 

Always look for the right price before investing in stocks.

2583 2019-03-13 00:43:19 Options or stocks?
2584 2019-03-13 00:42:25 It could be an incredible company.  No opinion either way.  We don't trade stocks and we aren't short anything in cannabis world.  We highlight governance noise, such as releases about an option on a future option to a future event.  That ain't news.
2585 2019-03-13 00:41:39 basically we're on game 1, three stocks, not even have anything, i want to be really rushdown to see if i can get the set, but i have already lost some to her, so i am playing safe, you know, being more of a kirby taunt than a dedede crouch {...}
2586 2019-03-13 00:40:43 Your my inspiration man
2587 2019-03-13 00:40:23 Who cares if people own spy or a basket of stocks. When it crashes all crashes.
2588 2019-03-13 00:39:17 What you're really waiting for is the point in time when a central bank Cuts interest rates and equity markets go down

Which is what happened in late 2007 early 2008

Maybe they figured out how bad that is so now when they cut crates they buy stocks to
2589 2019-03-13 00:38:24 You shouldn’t punish a player for taking their own stocks by taking their stocks
2590 2019-03-13 00:38:06 some nice looking charts ive come across over last couple hours, in no particular order:

2591 2019-03-13 00:37:36 I still don’t understand why someone gets punished for sd-ing. In free for all you lose 2 stocks for it. Why? Who gains from it? If someone is sd-ing then they probably don’t want their stocks anyways lmao
2592 2019-03-13 00:37:25 @nyknicks @Giants your front offices are the laughing stocks of your leagues... BUMS!
2593 2019-03-13 00:36:15 Parang sa bigas lang Mam @raissawriter hindi inayos ang pag-angkat tapos Pilipino ang hirap bumili dahil sa taas ng presyo at kawalan ng stocks.
2594 2019-03-13 00:35:18 Sold a few stocks today, so I'm ready with extra dry powder to burn if it does! But also, we may never even see under $50 ever again!
2595 2019-03-13 00:34:54 Well both that’s how the current system is. The public does own some stocks and of course we must help the poor in someway. The healthcare needs fixing as well it’s way too expensive today.
2596 2019-03-13 00:34:24 Will explain further.? Please! What do you meant by front running? I follow/own these stocks. Thanks
2597 2019-03-13 00:33:49 Do any of them own private prison stocks?
2598 2019-03-13 00:33:21 So as Boston fans we’ve got 4 solid teams to root for all the while the Knicks and Giants are laughing stocks in their respective leagues. It’s the little things that perk me up
2599 2019-03-13 00:33:13 Axe Capital knows stocks
2600 2019-03-13 00:32:24 Nice way to recognize your schedule and stay disciplined. Sticking to rules & setting good habits is key!

2602 2019-03-13 00:30:48 The Browns went from laughing stocks to serious contenders in two offseasons. I tip my cap to them.
2603 2019-03-13 00:30:38 @StopCampfield I appreciate your re-tweets of my comments.  The hypocrisy in this country is overwhelming.  I just saw a pop-up advertising investing in pot stocks.  It'll be white elites making fortunes from pot while poor blacks and Latinos continue to be jailed for using it.
2604 2019-03-13 00:30:18 Nice...
2605 2019-03-13 00:30:05 Please put a such list of 52 week low stocks also

2617 2019-03-13 00:25:55 @RothenbergESPN what advice do you give to a knicks, Mets and giants fan after this trade? Focus on stocks? Take up golfing?

2619 2019-03-13 00:25:00 @mr_kristof007 Banks should not permit Credit cards to be used for purchasing Crypto or stocks or any other financial asset. No debit cards are another matter.
2620 2019-03-13 00:24:15 @49ers free agency

-Overpay for the second best linebacker available 
-Sign a second kicker after FRANCHISE tag Robbie Gould
-sign our long snapper through 2020
-Pussy out of a trade with the 2 laughing stocks of the NFL 

Bravo, our players on Twitter are better than recruiting
2621 2019-03-13 00:23:22 These days are the best time to buy kpop stocks. But how and where?
2622 2019-03-13 00:23:19 Yes I do. I have the microcap bundle so it’s only stocks under $5.00 for listed stocks plus all the OTCs. That saves a few bucks and I hardly play higher priced stocks anyways. Plus I’m in enough chatrooms that I’ll see people talking about those other stocks if they are moving
2623 2019-03-13 00:22:21 Cleveland Browns went from laughing stocks to potential SB contenders & must see TV in 12 months.

2624 2019-03-13 00:20:51 park bom my queen is coming back today while yg stocks is crashing and yge is burning lolol #karma
2625 2019-03-13 00:20:05 Things I was never taught in school: how to pay taxes. My basic human rights. The laws of the country I live in. Hot to get a mortgage. How to get a loan. How to get a doctor. How to get stocks. How to invest and diversify my money. How to get insurance. Comprehensive sex Ed. Etc
2626 2019-03-13 00:18:49 ...paid out by the people who own the capital. It will come from people  who own stocks and get 10%+ compound interest return on their  investments while wages from labor continue to collapse
2627 2019-03-13 00:18:22 And frankly, if the ATF just "says" the date is extended... Well, they said bump stocks weren't machineguns. If they said it, I'd fully expect ATF to announce n 3/27, "Psych! Theyre' illegal. You're felons."
2628 2019-03-13 00:18:14 Disgusting! Sell this garbage (1 billion shares outstanding) and buy into stocks that have a strong capital structure (sub 200m s/o junior producers; sub 150m s/o developers; sub 100m s/o explorers) to benefit from any bullish move  in gold prices.
2629 2019-03-13 00:17:59 Pell shouldn't be allowed to "live out the end of his life in the community", he should be rocketed to a fucking prison planet and forced to fight crab people. He should tour the country in the stocks and everyone with a medicare card should be allowed to kick him in the balls.
2630 2019-03-13 00:16:31 Bump stocks and machine guns assault weapons
2631 2019-03-13 00:16:01 I guess they’re sick of being the laughing stocks. #Browns
2632 2019-03-13 00:13:28 The Browns and the Raiders used to be the laughing stocks of the NFL now both of them are making big boy moves!
2633 2019-03-13 00:12:32 I’m a freaking wizard!! I can also tell you which stocks to pick
2634 2019-03-13 00:11:18 I thought I was the only 1 that remembered this. Not a huge deal, but I cant believe that they are now lying to us and when they get called out, “it subject to change.” Amazed to see dem taking the EA steps towards business, let’s see if their stocks drop as well, then they care.
2635 2019-03-13 00:10:16 Analysts should have ratings, just like stocks.  Would be amazing to see how many underperform vs. their “predictions”
2636 2019-03-13 00:10:14 @SpeakerPelosi  but sure 
..  let voters try to keep you in office.
Hacked elections = you all keep ur pensions health care and ability to inside trade on stocks.  Legally.

2637 2019-03-13 00:09:32 Man this old timer with cancer was telling me how CBD and that sweet sweet ganja saved his life .. I never threw 100 bucks into my stocks so quick in the history of my strategic investment career
2638 2019-03-13 00:09:19 Had that happen to me yesterday. The dude got one kill and kept running most of the match. I eventually took two of his stocks and did the same to him and won. I hate people sometimes
2639 2019-03-13 00:08:40 Browns stocks just went 
2640 2019-03-13 00:08:14 Damn my stocks just went tf up like crazy thank y’all frfr
2641 2019-03-13 00:08:10 what is preferred stocks means?
2642 2019-03-13 00:08:02 You realize they can make more way more than 5bps lending the stocks, right?
2643 2019-03-13 00:06:51 very well congratulations  
2644 2019-03-13 00:05:53 i should've made my move quicker. naubusan na ako ng stocks huhuhuhu
2645 2019-03-13 00:05:19 Those cult, niche stocks never end well.
2646 2019-03-13 00:03:15 Yeah you get 6x leverage so every 1k is 6k buying power so your able to play lower priced stocks with 500-1000 shares easy. I blew up probably 5-10 times a 1k account lol
2647 2019-03-13 00:03:11 Last time they used few blue chip stocks to take it high but this time it seems to be broad based and therefore more convincing rally.
2648 2019-03-13 00:03:11 Countries that run big game have the largest stocks. Because the industry pays for the protection.  Do gooders like yourself in this instance will achieve the exact opposite of your intentions
2649 2019-03-13 00:02:43 Whoever will do that tomorrow is blocked at my end, taking satisfaction on other’s people losses is disgusting.

Sending all my love to anyone that holds this stocks.

2650 2019-03-13 00:02:10 In the end you are fundamentally valuing stocks and capital over human lives, I am trying to be nicer online but g damn, c’mon rich. m4a is bad because what about the stocks? Jfc
2651 2019-03-13 00:02:07 Over the past 120 years, had you invested in the US in the following assets, your purchasing power would’ve increased by: 

1. Residential real estate: 0x
2. T-Bills: 2.6x
3. Bonds: 9.9x
4. Stocks: 1521x
2652 2019-03-13 00:02:07 Bullish for stocks tho, right? \s
