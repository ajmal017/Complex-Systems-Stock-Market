43 2018-10-02 23:42:47 I guess a lot of people make stock pics based on what @themotleyfool tells them to do. Release an article stating selling your cannabis stocks is a good idea. Immediate sell off ensues. WTF. Don’t let them talk you out of gains.

47 2018-10-02 23:38:33 Valid point. It's a CD company, but it trades with the multiples of the tech sector. Kind of a grey area between cons disc and tech. Like $AMZN is classified as CD but it's kinda both. So is $ETSY. 
The CD stocks that have big online platforms tend to trade at bigger multiples.

56 2018-10-02 23:34:19 Effective how? Economy? Google any economic metric you want - GDP, jobs, housing, stocks, etc - and you’ll see it’s all been on the rise for years before Trump.

Otherwise, he has completely socially alienated over half the country and just got laughed at in a UN meeting.

76 2018-10-02 23:22:09 BS! It nice propaganda but it’s not real! Every day, middle class workers don’t have 401ks not stocks! Wages are not up under this trickle down, which has NEVER worked! CEOs & owners pocket the tax breaks! Those jobs you mention dont make ends meet-therefore people work 2
77 2018-10-02 23:20:33 That’s bullshit.  CEOs keep wages down while giving themselves bonuses all the time. That stupid tax break was supposed to create jobs and give companies opportunities to raise wages. Instead they went out and bought back their own stocks. Wages are artificially kept low
78 2018-10-02 23:19:16 Moved 90% to cash. I did not. Waiting for the setups to present themselves. Most all my swing trades came right back to entry after only 3-4 days. Red flag. So gotta wait for dust to settle, then re-enter again. Waiting game now.

94 2018-10-02 23:06:57 Gave us the raise but took away bonuses and stocks thank god the stocks part don’t affect me feel sorry for whoever come in after
95 2018-10-02 23:06:52 Hourly employees are actually LOSING MONEY, as Amazon also TOOK AWAY stocks and monthly bonuses.  This going in to their “peak season” when people would ordinarily make their biggest bonuses.
96 2018-10-02 23:05:49 Add $NKE to the list of stocks to sell/short.  As of today 10/2/18.    So clearly market has turned bearish.  Sell/Short $NKE $AMD $FB and $BABA in the near short term ...

101 2018-10-02 23:03:30 My husband has worked in warehouse for 6 years— we are LOSING MONEY because they took away stocks and bonuses from hourly employees to compensate for the wage hike.  Employees NOT HAPPY.
102 2018-10-02 23:03:07 Thanks! It's worth it! The rule is twofold: 

1. You shall only check your stocks once per week on a set day, and it must be after hours. 
2. If tempted to check stocks outside of set day, you shall toss your phone nondescriptly and yell "KIAI!"

#2 is optional, but satisfying
103 2018-10-02 23:02:42 You climbed mountains 
and built skyscrapers 
You made TV shows 
and put out newspapers 
You were wicked good at doing stocks

but when I die uncle
104 2018-10-02 23:02:36 I'm soul owner so I have no stocks to but back, but I did give Xmas bonuses and a 14% raise this past February and I also have hired 3 more employees.
So stick lib.
105 2018-10-02 23:01:59 What he did as a result is cut our monthly vcp bonus (when he hit %105 fullfilment of orders) and took away our stocks. Costing each employee over $4,000 annually.
This move hurt us badly.
106 2018-10-02 23:00:21 i don’t trade those type of stocks
107 2018-10-02 22:58:43 Poor Donald complained that there are too many rules preventing him from taking action against bump stocks.
108 2018-10-02 22:58:28 Yeah no stocks for new people and no vcp
109 2018-10-02 22:58:27 if he was serious, he would sign an executive order until congress figures it out.   but in reality, congress could pass a single bill / clean bill, addressing the bump stocks all by themselves... but, they want to complicate the bump stocks by combining that with other stuff
110 2018-10-02 22:57:54 Silly but expensive stocks do make it harder for low income investors to buy. That is a fact. Someone opening a brokerage with $1500 for example, cannot buy 1 share of AMZN.

127 2018-10-02 22:47:32 BS marketing.   Moderate risk, growing dividend paying stocks are the long term key to success.  When people say government by and for the corporations, nod yes, and tell them that's how your betting for your retirement.
128 2018-10-02 22:47:17 Follow rules when trading, example In out On penny stocks, I papered traded 4k profit under 60 seconds,done this 15 times. But i lose when i ride the wave. Strange: The wave drowns me every time. I have traded the same stock in paper world 7 times max on the 8 I lost 10 percent.
129 2018-10-02 22:47:06 We got a bonus every month for not using our unpaid time so now we lost that, and we got shares of amazon stocks to sell every year and now we won’t anymore. So it’s like we’re losing money honestly.
130 2018-10-02 22:46:27 Al Paccino's Stocks in Paper Mario is Perfectly Acceptable
131 2018-10-02 22:46:08 They took away hourly employees bonuses and stocks to compensate for their loss.  People who have put time in to the company are LOSING MONEY.
132 2018-10-02 22:45:30  Have a look these #stocks that reached all-time highs: $NVDA
133 2018-10-02 22:45:10 True, but I see more expecting of it in crypto. Every partnership is moon city. Does crypto have sector rotation like stocks? I haven't seen a pattern.

135 2018-10-02 22:43:40 Stocks almost at 100! and the TV deal only boosted them to like 40 or 50 per share. 
Not sure how the Stock Price Correlates to the programming being put on but the Stock never sucks.
136 2018-10-02 22:43:29 These laughing stocks are not even safe in their own religiously filled country. They just illegally going to europe, us  from entire middle east. But hindus are intolerant. Too much.
137 2018-10-02 22:43:27 Ppl shd kno they took away bonuses and stocks to compensate.  The rich continue to get richer.
138 2018-10-02 22:41:23 Even better would be to get a wealth tax so we have a record of stocks as well as flows.

162 2018-10-02 22:19:21 The stock market is up! Has been for a while now, even before #DT. Look at the facts. How many working people have stocks?? None!

181 2018-10-02 22:06:56 Nah they took out vcp and stocks. So that’s why it went up a dollar pretty much lol.
182 2018-10-02 22:06:39 @BernieSanders yes they giving us a raise but taking away bonuses and stocks, yeah thanks Amazon 
183 2018-10-02 22:06:27 Define common sense gun laws. There is no accepted definition of an assault rifle, so what are you talking about?  I agree on bump stocks.  As to guns, the problem is not the guns but the people using them improperly. It is like saying a spoon is responsible for your obesity.
184 2018-10-02 22:05:59 Banning stocks won't curb violent crimes. In fact, additional gun laws of any kind are pointless. People kill people, and we've been doing it since long before guns and in much more violent ways!
185 2018-10-02 22:05:36 FYI: JB wants to take your guns... From the JB Pritzker website: "Ban assault weapons, high capacity magazines, and bump stocks in Illinois..."

187 2018-10-02 22:04:00 Lots of stocks stretched from the 50 DMA. Maybe a correction with time or just a plain old correction before moving on. The former would wear traders out I think.
188 2018-10-02 22:02:49 Aren’t they supposed to show up on TV pumping stocks so they can unload their positions with less slippage?

190 2018-10-02 22:01:30 as fiat is continuously debased i find it much easier only to decide between real cash (gold/pms) and productive real assets (stocks) while ignoring the underlying asset inflation / purchasing power erosion in fiat. whether to be in gold or stocks is a function of point in cycle
191 2018-10-02 22:01:22 I was just told that my family member that has been working for Amazon @jeffbezos for 8 years lost their stocks options and their monthly bonuses. His wages was capped at $15 now he will make $16 but lost other benefits. So Amazon is duping the public.
192 2018-10-02 22:01:21 So we get the wage increase but Bezos has to cut the only incentives we get as Amazon employees in order to do it? Bc he isn't the richest man in the world or anything right? This man sold how many of his stocks just last year without flinching but now we don't get any? Wtf.
193 2018-10-02 22:01:06 @karenfinerman u have Adorable kids, v bless them. however, on the GM, the Cadillac division is doing bad with bad vehicles and other vehicles are very costlier not as charming as Acura or even Infinity. No wonder their stocks taking beating.

203 2018-10-02 21:52:48 @jeffkatzshow what you don't know is they stopped $2000 bonus stocks for thousands of employees to pay for this.
204 2018-10-02 21:52:43 Charles, record close but breadth of market was bearish....not a great two days for stocks as a whole, I hope you bring that up..it's not all sunshine & roses..
205 2018-10-02 21:52:21 $15 per hour is great but my brother-in-law who has worked for @amazon for 8 years & was capped at $15 is only getting $1 increase and is losing monthly bonuses PLUS stocks valued at more than the $1 per hour increase is worth.
206 2018-10-02 21:51:46 Lower taxes. High stocks. Lowest unemployment.  Iran deal dead. Isis destroyed.

Lol. These people need help
207 2018-10-02 21:51:27 This is BS. They took the bonus stocks thousands of employees were getting to pay for this.
208 2018-10-02 21:50:44 Not to mention they cut off the vcp bonus and no more stocks for new hires. I'm making the same money. I'm actually making less during peak.

229 2018-10-02 21:42:12 These pot stocks are seriously messing with everyone. It reminds me of driving in traffic, and you are in a lane that isn’t moving, so you switch lanes but the moving lane instantly gets stuck while the lane you gave up on starts moving. Definitely head clear time.

244 2018-10-02 21:36:55 Stocks are hovering around Jan highs. Since then, housing has leveled off, auto stocks at 52 wk lows in bear markets. Economic data worsening. Great time to buy into undervalued stocks and open up short positions in inflated sectors like consumer cyclical and tech.

249 2018-10-02 21:35:28 Amazon raised the minimum wage for his workers but he doesn’t tell anyone that he is taking bonuses and stocks off of his workers so he didn’t give them anything he just made it sound good
250 2018-10-02 21:35:27 Goood practice
251 2018-10-02 21:35:06 They have difficulty hiring due to rumors like the one above or just lack of interest in the job. One of the reasons they’ve raised the wage, but it still equals the same compensation tied to bonuses and stocks that people outside would not know about.
252 2018-10-02 21:35:02 "You'll probably wish you *had* grabbed these stocks".  That drives me nuts!

264 2018-10-02 21:32:32 Bernie I am seriously disappointed in you.... and Mr. Bezos, yeah you can give raises. But if you take the employees stocks and their incentives just for a raise to $15 and nothing more, then you still have some serious work to do. Tied 1’s are you workforce, don’t forget that...
265 2018-10-02 21:31:21 It would be nice if Cortana could track the price of Crypto-Currencies in addition to traditional stocks :)
266 2018-10-02 21:31:12 @realDonaldTrump what do you think of Mr.@JeffBezos decision to take away benefits (VCP bonuses and RSU stocks) from his most dedicated employees to pay for the $15 min wage? #shameonyouamazon
267 2018-10-02 21:31:10 VCP is our monthly bonus we get based on performance/attendance and RSU are stocks we used to get every year.  Not anymore.
268 2018-10-02 21:30:31 Thanks Sarge, great advice for your daily fans- I am also long these stocks: BP, RDS.B, SLB, JPM, GS, C, INTC, MSFT and Amazon.
269 2018-10-02 21:29:52 I don’t even know where to begin with your crying. My paycheck is up, my stocks are up and we hired 4 new employees. Thank you President Trump! #trumpismypresident
270 2018-10-02 21:29:46 Then why bring up slide fire or bump stocks...why not say this place is selling guns illegally?
271 2018-10-02 21:29:45 $AMDA is getting some action in after-hours. $MNGA contagion? all penny stocks are waking up again.
272 2018-10-02 21:29:01 Stock market is no indicator of a healthy economy. It only follows 30 stocks. People have given up looking for jobs. Wages are stagnant. 2 years into this joke of a presidency tax cuts for the wealthy & corporations but no jobs or infrastructure programs. Miss me with the b.s.
273 2018-10-02 21:28:33 You must watch CNN. My Paycheck is up and so are my stocks. Thank you President Trump! #trump2020
274 2018-10-02 21:27:50 There will be a meeting this Thursday 10/4 in U511 @ 8:40 for all members interested in the fall Stock Market Challenge. Learn about stocks and get cording/letting points!
275 2018-10-02 21:27:35 My stocks are up and so is my paycheck. On a different note, how’s the Russian collusion thing going for you Libs?
TRUMP 2020
276 2018-10-02 21:27:20 Slide fire stocks, or "Bump Stocks", are not illegal Federally, nor licensed.A few States have made them illegal, but the vast majority have not.
277 2018-10-02 21:26:45 Samsung and the others are emptying stocks so when they slow memory manufacturing next year the prices will be high because there are no old stocks to fall back on.
278 2018-10-02 21:25:50 Hammer on #STAN so it might try to move up. Oil and Mining Stocks look better and STAN often moves with these. EM exposure I guess.
279 2018-10-02 21:25:48 Oh Brad do some basic research I understand how stocks work I own annuities I AM talking about buybacks from top shareholders the entire argument for the taxscam was it would trickle down resulting in higher wages it hasn’t- You wanna trade insults?
280 2018-10-02 21:25:28 $IWM is getting abused day in and day out.. $IYT followed suite & the $DJIA lead the market! THIS NEVER ENDS WELL! But there is strength in certain stocks like $AAPL and $BA.  My head officially hurts! Took profits on a lot of protective puts .. hope I won't regret that tomorrow!
281 2018-10-02 21:24:49 Yes, it's a very "split" market. While most stocks are advancing, those that are losing are losing badly. Based on 20 years of looking into it, I personally don't care *why* they're declining (int'l exposure, interest rates, etc).
282 2018-10-02 21:24:25 Oh no, bump stocks are getting banned.
Gotta use my FUCKING THUMB NOW.
OR A RUBBER BAND.

285 2018-10-02 21:22:50 Firstly George has no milling agreement with uuuu. And anyone claiming such should actually call the companies and verify. Secondly energy fuel sold them only 10% of their least productive assets. Stocks been on fire no question but recognize the risk.
286 2018-10-02 21:22:26 The deal is the same, and we know why your dumb dads way of making money off the stock market is attack the deal let the stocks go down they you rich people buy it up and dump dad makes the deal the same. But the rich walk away with millions.
287 2018-10-02 21:21:41 My stocks are up and so is my paycheck. You must not be good at your job or your stocks. We just hired 4 new people thanks to this economy.

294 2018-10-02 21:18:59 I’m gonna stop checking on these bum ass stocks. It’s driving me crazy. If I lose money So be it
295 2018-10-02 21:17:09 Any ass can make the stocks go up if you cut taxes on the rich, and the CORP.and take away from the middle class and poor.
296 2018-10-02 21:16:57 @Richzeoli Before there were "bump stocks" there were the deadly ice cube trays.
297 2018-10-02 21:16:51 Then we resort to pitchforks, burning torches and the stocks in the market square 
298 2018-10-02 21:16:30 $DTEA It's mandatory by the financial authorities. When stocks goes up like that, either disclose material news or say it's speculation.
299 2018-10-02 21:16:22 If trade war escalates we will see less small business. Trump poured gas on decade long economic cycle. Hes piling up debt 'big league'. Stocks are inflated by buy backs and foreign capital looking for yield. I'm looking forward 2-3 yrs, it's not good.
300 2018-10-02 21:16:11 Love republicans..Trump donating his wage...tax reform...stocks r super high...military can go to reg hospital if have to wait to long for vet hospital.....all great things...wants a wall...democrats want aliens, drugs brought in, crazy thinking..want gun control too

306 2018-10-02 21:11:33 It’s not about what you personally believe. A market is full of irrational buyers and sellers. Nobody knows the future. You think you do and that’s a fallacy that allows put traders to make enormous profit off the naivenees of people who think stocks can only go up forever.
307 2018-10-02 21:11:01 Bad sign:  Dow makes new high but NASDAQ closes below 8000, S&P below 3000. + bank stocks weak. How do I spell c-o-r-e-c...

310 2018-10-02 21:10:37 Markets today felt like Groundhog Day- similar to yesterday, strong Dow +120 points but similar to yesterday weakness in Nasdaq -.5% and Russell 2000 -1%, and a veritable war zone in Consumer stocks across the board. Bulls need to reassert control tmrw or COULD get ugly
311 2018-10-02 21:10:23 Market Close: MBS +6bps; DOW +122.73; NASDAQ -37.76; S&P 500 -1.16; 10yr Treasury 3.06%;  Stocks end Mixed, with good day on the DOW, but NASDAQ and S&P 500 not so good; MBS closed off of earlier highs.

313 2018-10-02 21:08:27 yup - stocks can be funny - but I got in at 2$ and have started pulling out cash just so i don't have to work. the business model at this point is very favorable to AMD stock. If it takes a year or more it doesn't concern me - i've done the homework :)
314 2018-10-02 21:08:21 I don't know how anyone would want to buy these stocks that got decimated this week.  Some major damage in top stocks.
315 2018-10-02 21:08:14 Oh I see big shot are we? Lose a few hundred grand and it means nothing? How much did you really make ripping off investors and screwing them when at Darwin? Sit on your arse and play penny stocks now do we ?
316 2018-10-02 21:07:42 Let’s see little Adam investigate how maxi waters accumulated so much money on a senators salary all these years. Perhaps some banking stocks ?
317 2018-10-02 21:07:02 Armenians says close to finalizing beloved ban on tribute bump stocks
318 2018-10-02 21:06:43 I think purely from a "sentiment" point of view.... I suspect the stocks and sectors that got dumped hard last 2 or 3 days will very likely get a bounce day tomorrow
319 2018-10-02 21:06:30 I'm trying to figure out how is #VegasStronger?
We voted for universal background checks. Laxalt refused to implement it. Now he's running for governor.
Bump stocks still legal. MGM sued survivors. Gun violence occurs everyday in Vegas.
Empty slogans shouldn't replace reality

322 2018-10-02 21:05:33 So full of shit.  What are you doing for the marine ecosystem damage of wild salmon stocks from salmon farming?  Wild salmon are being decimated!
323 2018-10-02 21:05:08 Report the fact that the majority of better (earnings/forecasts) stocks over the past 3Q in the U.S have been trashed by wall street(fund managers) and/or other investors (wealthy with an agenda-?), or have not advanced at all since January. Average earnings growth 25%, Scam
324 2018-10-02 21:04:51 I think the argument is that if someone buys a house off a landlord and then occupies that house - the number of people who are housed (thinking shared houses) is reduced and the reduction in rental stocks will then push rents higher.

That's the theory as I understand it.

331 2018-10-02 21:01:12 From the Edward Jones investment  firm . US stocks have gained more than 300% since this bull market began in March 2009. Racing ahead of most other investments we think they’ll continue to rise overtime supported by solid economic growth and strong earnings growth.

335 2018-10-02 21:00:42 It depends on the underlying asset that you're investing in. Some focus on dividend-paying companies, which have a more stable stock price & pay out consistent dividends. Other ETFs might invest in growth stocks, which will see capital appreciation instead of regular div payments

342 2018-10-02 20:58:04 He's making too much money from the NRA to say anything. Did you notice that bump stocks are still available a year after those killings in Las Vegas?
343 2018-10-02 20:57:57 They didn’t listen. They took away stocks and bonus pay which equaled way more than the raise. They took away money instead. You’re only getting one side of the actual arrangement.

346 2018-10-02 20:54:51 The reality is these guys race at tracks all over the southeast and came together for that race. With multiple hundreds of late model stocks racing at multiple tracks weekly it's IMPOSSIBLE not to have duplicates. Add an 'X' or the state they're from 4, 4x , 4NC...

353 2018-10-02 20:49:58 you need to set rules in place, otherwise patience will always be tested and down the rabbit hole you go. If you join trading rooms, use it as a reference only to what stocks people are trading, not how they trade it. Following ppl will only hurt you in learning the right way.
354 2018-10-02 20:49:46 They never unfolded the stocks, no wonder they always missed!
355 2018-10-02 20:49:39 You are an absolute fraud you give your temps and partime workers a raise to $15 an hour and TOOT your horn like you did something great yet your regular workers get nothing and stocks and vcp cut. Let’s talk about the mass walk out at ETNA OHIO TODAY

357 2018-10-02 20:48:20 Amazon is slowly and effectively killing US store fronts. The elimination of many small farmers was years ago. They want us to buy stocks, not own companies. Family owned businesses are the heart of the US. Giant corporations are the assassins of joy and health.

It’s fear... 

When everyone including the monkey’s uncle are bearish stocks at the moment price will go 

I’m surprised by the amount of people who fail to see this logic.
361 2018-10-02 20:46:30 I got out of it.  Someone is controlling the price AND every time there is news, it's a sell on the news.  There are other pot stocks that are making moves so not waiting on one that won't budge.

374 2018-10-02 20:42:35 Curious @DiMartinoBooth about the difference between the Stock Market today and the StockMarket in 2011. In 2011 it seemed artificially inflated because Fed held interest rates near 0% so people left bond market and invested in stocks. Now interest rates rising but people

380 2018-10-02 20:39:35 There’s millions of people trading stocks today that have only known one market—a bull
381 2018-10-02 20:39:34 Make part of the income payable in stocks, this way they'll even have more skin in the game. Why investing money is more valuable than investing time from one's finite life?
382 2018-10-02 20:39:24 Has less to do with stocks and bonds and more just buying and selling crap for silly fake prices as a way to transfer money without paying taxes on it.
383 2018-10-02 20:39:07 $LEVB watch this thing rocket just like $IGC $NBEV $TLRY $CRON $CGC did on entering this market pot stocks just start ppl, face it

385 2018-10-02 20:38:45 I'm actually ashamed that such a power-hungry, arrogant, clueless idiot is SoS for Scotland he's sold his country out for English gold and the promise of an ermine coat  
I'd like to put him in stocks and pelt him with eggs, but I'd rather give my eggs to foodbank

388 2018-10-02 20:37:10 Ford is deeply tied to  CIA, likely an asset, has stocks in the morning after pill, deeply ingrained on the left on issues and activist for them, scrubbed  social media, changed title on employment page, used an attorney who is tied directly to the Clintons, lied & story changed
389 2018-10-02 20:37:01 it’s was definitely not even close. rags vs elegant was a whole 3-0 of oppression wizzy vs ralphie was like a 2 or 3 stocks
390 2018-10-02 20:36:41 “He gave him loan after loan, many never repaid. He provided money for his car, money for his employees, money to buy stocks, money for his first Manhattan offices and money to renovate those offices. He gave him three trust funds. He gave him shares in multiple partnerships.”
391 2018-10-02 20:36:29 Exactly...1386 stocks up on NYSE today while 2119 down. 3x as many new lows on NYSE as new highs. Small caps, transports look awful. Banks don’t look good either.

393 2018-10-02 20:35:52 Yeah, it's terrific. Only they took away the stocks and the monthly bonus, so if you've capped out by working more than three years, you're taking a pay cut.
394 2018-10-02 20:35:39 They are manipulating the hell out of the stocks
395 2018-10-02 20:35:04 On that very subject, we did however find a toyshop that stocks the last UK manufacturer of hand sewin teddy bears etc. they are super cute...
396 2018-10-02 20:34:53 companies using it towards stock buybacks. their employees should buy stocks 
397 2018-10-02 20:34:53 Don’t worry brother, you’re a great trader. There stocks don’t play by the rules. I know you’ll come back strong!
398 2018-10-02 20:34:45 Canadian bank stocks gonna go down cause of this trend?

406 2018-10-02 20:32:37 The stocks aren’t looking good @ ol

408 2018-10-02 20:32:30 Rotation? Where do you suggest we go/ into what stocks??
409 2018-10-02 20:32:17 The number of stocks down 10% and 20% from their highs continues to grow. I figure at some point, the pundits and media will espouse the "stealth bear market" theme again
410 2018-10-02 20:32:00 Feeling like 2019's gonna be a big year for dad lit. Time to take out stocks in John Grisham imo.
411 2018-10-02 20:31:49 But, we thought he only started as a pauper with only a million. So in 30 plus years he at best turned it into 3billion.  He could have gotten a 4 times that just leaving it in the stock market playing the top 100 stocks.
412 2018-10-02 20:31:45 Need that Dreams trucker hat when it stocks again chief @___Sneakerhead...
413 2018-10-02 20:31:26 ONS - In cash terms the stock of human capital in the UK grew 1.8%. However, once the effects of inflation were removed human capital actually fell by 0.8%. This was the first fall in human capital stocks since 2012, reflecting slower growth in earnings relative to inflation.

415 2018-10-02 20:29:39 If sanity, stability, good health; mental, physical and spiritual balance were stocks they would be higher than Berkshire Hathaway Inc. nowadays.
416 2018-10-02 20:29:24 This really would be great is you didn’t take your current employees benefits. No more stocks and more Vcp
417 2018-10-02 20:29:13 I have a few friends that still work there and they've been with them for a number of years. They mentioned something about getting their stocks taken away and only the new hires getting the raise. If I learn more information I'll let you know.
418 2018-10-02 20:28:39 Think Bill Chappell deserves the 2018 esoteric or maybe even spurious trophy of the year This wage allows employees to buy loads of distressed stocks But some wonky socialist mathematician will say my comparison is not fair. A penny stock = 1500 shares = 2.4 seconds. Fair deal?
419 2018-10-02 20:28:30 If I was right all the time on stocks I would just do that.
420 2018-10-02 20:26:46 I’m mad they took them stocks and bonuses tho
421 2018-10-02 20:25:55 Environment wise there's recovering from that. Trump should have never been allowed to take office. Russia influenced our election, they won it for him. And look where it's taken us. More hatred, poor environment care, poor budget, risk of nuclear war, constantly dropping stocks.
422 2018-10-02 20:25:39 Then banks stocks are worth zero
423 2018-10-02 20:25:17 $FATE Not budging. Actually up more than 1% while there is blood in the streets. Still one of my favorite Biotech stocks. Often this is a sign for more strength to come.
424 2018-10-02 20:24:41 Weird day in the market...it’s like the market drove down stocks to help the charts reset but trying to keep the major indices close to highs because they know we’re going higher  tomorrow will be key
425 2018-10-02 20:24:19 My stocks are kinda lack luster
426 2018-10-02 20:24:10 When working with Bill O'Neill years ago, heard him come in and say one time the stock market is starting a decline under the disguise of a rising Dow. Also, note Brokerage stocks like etrade etc have rolled over and housing stocks too.. plus rising interest rates.
427 2018-10-02 20:23:58 Sry for block. Undone. But that thread had nothing to do with stocks, I do not work in finance and do not intend to. None of my trading Tweets here have to do with employment or recruiting.
428 2018-10-02 20:23:46 This has got to be one of the most volatile stocks on the market
429 2018-10-02 20:23:01 We seem to have amassed a large amount of Dragon Ball Super Dash packs (Series 2-4).

Buy any Dragon Ball Super Booster Box or Draft Box and get two free Dash packs. While stocks last.
430 2018-10-02 20:22:54 Starting to tire of seeing 'seller's done' on stocks trading at lows. 

Somebody stating seller done leads to a price rise about 0% of the time.

@realDonaldTrump is president during Las Vegas shooting, vows to do more...bans bump stocks. Press asks why he didn’t do more.

436 2018-10-02 20:20:44 How many are still unable to pay their bills? How many are working more than one job? How many do not have health care? How many do not own stocks? How many are going hungry? @POTUS and @HouseGOP need to put regular people first, not the corps and the rich.
437 2018-10-02 20:20:29 $VIAV Multi-year cup with handle pattern pressure. Up on a day where most stocks are down.
438 2018-10-02 20:19:34 @mrgoodbeard__ yo I wanna link bro and talk business like stocks and shit
439 2018-10-02 20:19:34 Thanks Ron. Did you trade any stocks today in your virtual portfolio?
440 2018-10-02 20:19:17 The rare divergence between large U.S. stocks which have done far better than small ones over the past few months,may actually be a warning about the market’s future prospects.
441 2018-10-02 20:19:02 $AMD, $FL, $EW, $GPS, and $BBY were the top five stocks that closed lower today.
442 2018-10-02 20:18:56 When sh*t stocks like Tilray and CCG are flying 
in the pre market and bubbles are everywhere, 
we’re actually VERY close to a major selloff.  

We’re at Unprecedented levels of complacency. 
So, many investors have never seen real selling.
443 2018-10-02 20:18:54 4 stocks caught my attention today:

- $VIAV
- $CRBP
- $GWPH
- $FATE
444 2018-10-02 20:18:45 Nah. Put him in the stocks, where he could be pelted with custard pies. That would raise more money for charity, rather than sitting next to an egotistical bore.
445 2018-10-02 20:18:19 @TheCurryGuy, I’ve been busy making spice blends, sauces and stocks and looking forward to my first curry! Would you recommend stewed or tandoori chicken tikka in a Chasni?
446 2018-10-02 20:18:13 $INTC, $PCG, $AES, $FLR, and $NEM were the top five stocks that closed higher today.
447 2018-10-02 20:17:48 Gun control and bump-stocks are very easy to regulate now!  As soon as Trump is comfortable with ending his Corporate America friends profits for AR’s & Bump-Stocks -real weapon regs could happen!
448 2018-10-02 20:17:22 Trump signaled yesterday that they were going to ban bump stocks soon. That would be a pre election gambit to appeal to female voters. I hope Democrats are prepared to call that sham out when it happens. Are you?
449 2018-10-02 20:17:20 $AMD, $GE, $BAC, $F, and $INTC were today’s top five most active stocks.
450 2018-10-02 20:16:15 U.S. stocks closed mixed Tuesday,10/02/18: $DJIA +0.46% (+122.7) at 26,773.94, $SPX -0.04% (-1.1) at 2,923.43, $COMPQ -0.47% (-37.7) at 7,999.55.

453 2018-10-02 20:15:10 Wow these stocks blew up after hours. I was a sadboi all day.
454 2018-10-02 20:14:23 Why are people posting about bump stocks, but not about multiple shooters and helicopters flying around with their transponders off???  Or the Saudi Arabia arms sell that was going at same time??
455 2018-10-02 20:13:55 Sorry if you answered this already, been out at work all day. Is money rotating out of tech stocks too ?

458 2018-10-02 20:12:59 I wish I understood stocks and bonds because I just don't even understand how that works.
459 2018-10-02 20:12:56 What underlying forces do you think are responsible for the correlation as well as its effect on stocks?Thanks!
460 2018-10-02 20:12:38 U.S. stocks closed mixed Tuesday,10/02/18: $DJIA +0.46% at 26,773.94, $SPX -0.04% at 2,923.43, $COMPQ -0.47% at 7,999.55, $RUT -1.01% at $1656.08.
461 2018-10-02 20:12:24 Agree. Considering the weakness in other stocks, This one is holding up pretty well. Talk about relative strength!
462 2018-10-02 20:12:21 Congrats! I'll play it different this time. Jumped in at 17$ and i'm holding (not stubbornly). Don't want chase bottoms in others stocks, hoping..then panicking. If I had applied this to $Hexo a short time ago, I would be in the $ 100k today rather than half.
463 2018-10-02 20:11:47 Closing "green" stocks:  CZNI .0022 +41%....ADAC .006 +37%....RJDG .006 +10%....GATA .06 +9%....DIGAF .009 +4.7%....LWLG $1.06 +4%....IGXT $1.25 +4%....AMFE .115 +1.9% closes....have a great night!
464 2018-10-02 20:11:41 Bottom of the message indicates that stocks and bonuses are being taken away - presumably at the same time as the “raise” but unsure the context
465 2018-10-02 20:11:21 While cutting bonuses & awarding of stocks!
466 2018-10-02 20:10:48 He cutout all stocks & bonuses to those same workers.  You need to investigate what really happened
467 2018-10-02 20:09:37 World stocks lower: Europe -.5%; US -.04%. Stocks backed off their highs in dull profit taking. US stocks expensive while foreign stocks cheap. Still the fundamentals argue for US stocks to continue outperforming. Trade issues & political dysfunction could derail in short-term.
468 2018-10-02 20:09:29 I didn't touch that.  Easier stocks to trade.
469 2018-10-02 20:09:29 This narrative and would you said doesn’t make any sense. You completely got off the topic and you are not trying to be condescending bc you don’t know anything about stocks.
470 2018-10-02 20:09:13 Market is green yet stocks are beaten. Wallah ya bo fahad I took a bad hit in REAR and DDD hoping for a rebound but then I decided to cut my losses and ran away. Now I'm staying sideline watching.
471 2018-10-02 20:09:04 You change your mind, and decide to invest in Netflix stocks. The “choose the next storyline” idea is your best hope for riches. Go to chapter 8
472 2018-10-02 20:09:03 All time highs for #djia but Russell 2000 is down 5 pct from its highs a month ago. International stocks continuing to rain turds as well.

Innocuous divergence or signs of something more alarming?
473 2018-10-02 20:08:46 The Dow ends +122, +0.5%, but that masks a LOT of blood in the water today. S&P -0.04%, Nasdaq -0.5%, Russell 2000
-1.0%. Selling of smaller stocks is particularly heavy for second straight day. Why are bulls suddenly so nervous?
474 2018-10-02 20:08:40 Stocks, lowers, uppers, ammo, you know the necessities
475 2018-10-02 20:07:41 Forgot to say 4 interest hikes in 2018 and 2 more to follow,1.200,000,000 LBS of beef bought by Trumps gov[cannot b sold] to give false economy,Steel stocks drop by 38% withheld on exchanges,abject poverty rises by 58% due to lack of insurance,etc,etc,etc.
476 2018-10-02 20:07:32 Not watching only CNBC for stocks
477 2018-10-02 20:07:28 you are right.. the other day i also posted the same.. Feeling a surprise coming lol.. Actually many bigger stocks are overbot on their monthly so soone ror later will give.. $AMZN.
478 2018-10-02 20:07:27 all my stocks are down. Where is the money rotating too?
479 2018-10-02 20:07:20 Yes. Always tougher with unfamiliar stocks; would be curious to see what its OI chart looks like; perhaps worth a lotto (risky) or longer dated calls (less risk, more time?)
480 2018-10-02 20:07:02 Shanghai is Down 15% this year.

489 2018-10-02 20:03:48 Great job @amazon for bringing the minimum up to $15!

Also great job of screwing the employees that had built up to that number over years of hard work in your warehouses. Like my mother. They dont get the stocks anymore, nor the VCP incentives they've grown accustomed to.
490 2018-10-02 20:03:06 What brokerage do you use to be able to short these penny stocks?

495 2018-10-02 20:01:53 I have no idea why people want to short weed stocks right now that’s what’s hot right now it’s what’s trending they may be overextended but they can keep running and probably will it’s a hot market
496 2018-10-02 20:01:20 pretty sure it's coming from heavy hitters....I could be wrong but there wasn't any real reason for marijuana stocks to tumble like they did today...at least from what I saw out in the media.
497 2018-10-02 20:01:12 Just another DCB before lower, especially when stocks #crash. Miners will underperform metals significantly when that happens.
498 2018-10-02 20:00:59 for a start, ALL gun sales should be background checked - no gun show exemption. Second, get rid of assault weapons, bump stocks and large clips. And finally, restrict sales of ammunition and self made ammunition,. NO civilian needs an assault rifle. It would be a start.
499 2018-10-02 20:00:51 Ripple is like those penny stocks companies... money can be made by shorting big time then POOF ! It’s gone!

510 2018-10-02 19:54:36 Economic nationalism is a profoundly self-destructive philosophy, but, suppose we're fortunate to have economic nationalists who are so incompetent that they don’t even know how to reduce the trade deficit.  That’s why stocks are up today.
511 2018-10-02 19:54:29 Disappointing day for the gold miners

514 2018-10-02 19:53:56 $SPY Careful asking others for buy point on stocks when bears are in control. They might just give you what you "think" you want. Patience.
515 2018-10-02 19:53:46 Value stocks came back into favour today.  Rotating out of growth.

521 2018-10-02 19:51:19 @jimcramer $SFIX. This is the problem with your “buy partial position strategy”. Stocks generally don’t go down on good news. So, if you get a pullback after you buy a position, it’s usually not something you’ll want to add to. (SFIX is a screaming buy @29.). Growing pains.
522 2018-10-02 19:51:13 absolutely right, stocks vs usage is a more realistic gauge ... but it would still be a + for the market if we could stop printing 2's at the end of the crop year.
523 2018-10-02 19:50:56 Despite the fact that the Obama administration approved the sale of bump fire stocks on at least two occasions, the NRA is calling on the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATFE) to immediately review whether these devices comply with federal law.

580 2018-10-02 19:30:47 2 billion bushels of ending stocks ain't what it used to be.

If I remember correctly, ending stocks to use in 86/87 was 66%. That would be 9+ billion bushels with today's usage.
581 2018-10-02 19:30:17 As a result cuts were made that cost us money monthly (vcp) and our stocks have been taken away. This hurt more than it helped.

586 2018-10-02 19:28:49 Yesterday “Don’t Boo”“Hiccup” Heller (R-Adelson) celebrated one year of doing absolutely nothing about assault weapons, bump stocks, background checks for domestic abusers, the mentally ill,even terrorists. America’s most mediocre senator couldn’t even react to a Nevadan tragedy.
587 2018-10-02 19:28:16 A5: I’m interested in what the rest of you say. To me, the big difference is the word guarantee.

591 2018-10-02 19:26:55 And they continue to ignore that there has still been no official word that bump stocks attached to some of the recovered weapons were even used.

But the issue with hoarding wealth is not about cash in the bank, it's that those stocks should be in the hands of the workers
601 2018-10-02 19:24:05 if there are too many abusers to jail (that ol' excuse) perhaps we could bring back caning. and stocks. problem solved. scary?

652 2018-10-02 19:02:47 we were discussing stocks,
653 2018-10-02 19:02:39 Advancing stocks / Declining sticks
NYSE, market breath
654 2018-10-02 19:01:51 I am guessing you don’t have a 401k or stocks because if you did you would like the results thanks to President Trump and secondly he appears not to have a fat ass!  I have family in Cali that loves Trump so don’t assume everyone doesn’t want him to come!!!
655 2018-10-02 19:01:24 It’s high seas and outside Canada’s-Nunavut’s 200 mile exclusive economic zone. And no commercial fish stocks there now at any rate. In future would presumably protect fish stocks that cross from that area to domestic waters.
656 2018-10-02 19:00:55 I don't believe in mean reversion but I have now learnt that bonds & interest rates doesn't move like stocks. You get a headache if the Rand is R10 to the $. The sweet spot is R10 to the $. Stocks, small, don't have that spot. New co's bring new exciting things...
657 2018-10-02 19:00:53 A lot of these pot stocks are being traded by non traders pushing tons of money into robinhood accounts. Only thing you can do is go long in robinhood. Something to keep in mind, same stuff happened with Coinbase last year. I’m sure u remember

I too am short CGC , also the index.  Been taking profits each leg down, and will protect profits.  # of shorts probably cause whipsaw.
676 2018-10-02 18:54:08 ...fast forward to dot com boom.

Internet stocks were small, literally small. Good old Warren didn't understand them, he missed them. Mark Minervini, a trader,  made triple digit returns on them. He traded market structure not fundamentals thereof. He has done that for 35 years.
677 2018-10-02 18:52:50 @SenSchumer, @repjohnlewis, @SenFeinstein, @JoeManchinWV, @SenatorCollins,@lisamurkowski, @SenFlakeStaff You all have become laughing stocks in your desperation to tank Kavanaugh’s nomination. Nit picking some really stupid stuff like throwing ice at someone or teenagers...

685 2018-10-02 18:51:24 I just checked the image again. But my focus is on small stocks.

I think Coke and J&J were already big names in 1925. Big stocks rarely move that much. But Warren loves them because they churn dividends and have "moat"...

732 2018-10-02 18:35:38 As on Monday, don't be misled by the Dow's strength today. It's up 158 points, +0.6% so far. But the broad market is lower, esp smaller stocks. Russell 2000 index -0.7%, Nasdaq -0.2%. And losers outnumber winners 2 to 1 on Nasdaq, 16 to 14 on NYSE.

756 2018-10-02 18:26:21 Safe to say that's a trade off they chose to make?these numbers determine stocks, with an army of shorters on your back, I wouldn't do it differently.
757 2018-10-02 18:25:46 Because when you're blocked from doing anything effective, you might as well do what you can. Bump stocks as a piece of equipment aren't essential to someone making this kind of attack, but they do make it slightly easier. Nor do they serve any useful purpose.
758 2018-10-02 18:25:39 I hear that there will be an economic meltdown, Bank's shut down, stocks and bonds fizzling out too, prior to the 2018 Primaries??? Will we enter a new Bretton Woods and Glass Stegall Act system???? I sure hope so.

772 2018-10-02 18:16:56 Madness today - but yes when I look at the screen and I see much lower quality stocks off half as much , very comfortable going long and strong APH!

774 2018-10-02 18:16:33 Perhaps however @Q was wrong in stating that our guns are safe. With @POTUS announcement of the ban of bump stocks coming he will have gone down that road and I and millions other will not support that. Define infringe. This who support this ban will lose support #2A #Qanon #NRA
775 2018-10-02 18:16:32 And Bump Stocks are still legal in most states and on the internet!!!! What is our government waiting for???  ANOTHER MASSACRE??????

779 2018-10-02 18:13:21 Also, Fox Business News anchor suggests stocks will continue to rise b/c panic buying is about to set in.

781 2018-10-02 18:12:13 Keep quality over quantity! Works in real life and in stocks!!
782 2018-10-02 18:11:16 The word "sell" just isn't allowed with these guys.  Except on stocks like GE after its been destroyed.  Now there is zero reputational risk to say "sell GE".
LOL
783 2018-10-02 18:11:14 CRM is selling at 38X trailing 12mo gross cash flow. Even in high top line growth mode, thats expensive. great stocks are expensive most of the time. Benioff is one of the great ones. Cash is king because all co's want to maximize cash flow. GAAP can be gamed and often is.

787 2018-10-02 18:08:25 Top strategist on CNBC just said he likes stocks because they’re going to do better than bonds. We still haven’t gotten past comparing the returns from an asset class with the highest risk to an asset class with half the risk.

789 2018-10-02 18:07:26 After the slaughter in Vegas it’s heartening to know that just days afterward the President, The Senate and the House all banded together, across the aisle, without differences or argument banned bump stocks.

833 2018-10-02 17:54:21 Some folks are into whips and leather, I'm into buying (hopefully) cheap stocks nobody else wants to own. Picking up $STLY under $.50 today. Cash on hand is roughly $.44 with another $.50 in assets that may or may not be worth anything. Co is actively seeking a new operating biz.
834 2018-10-02 17:54:00 I suggest public "stocks", put the offender in stocks and let them be displayed for the folks to throw rotten fruit and veges at, public humiliation and shaming could be a fitting penalty. Then jail
835 2018-10-02 17:53:42 Many world markets have already suffered significant loses if you look outside the US (and FAANG stocks in particular).
836 2018-10-02 17:53:42 Yes, easy to figure out what stocks to buy and what sports games to bet on.
837 2018-10-02 17:53:28 We know a lot about mass shootings! People can own as many military type weapons as they want, bump stocks available. No real concern about who and how folks get to access weapons. People want to carry guns to the grocery store! This love affair w/ guns is killing us!!
838 2018-10-02 17:53:26 Basically, being wrong about everything as long as stocks go up and financial sectors profiteer and prosper, is akin to being "right!"

846 2018-10-02 17:50:40 Many stocks still making new intraday lows.Indexes not telling the whole story here.
847 2018-10-02 17:50:37 To be clear we do not short stocks nor do we own Apple. Just because Warren Buffett invests doesn't mean it's the right choice. Warren is always brought in to fix companies and prop them up think people think.
848 2018-10-02 17:49:43 Correct, the only choices are around desired reliability of the glidepaths to wealth and spending. Are we building generational wealth or just saving for our personal retirement etc? Indexes, individual stocks and bonds are just ingredients of making the right "bread" for us.
849 2018-10-02 17:49:40 Cryptocurrency dropped 80% from its peak. Dot-com stocks dropped 75% from their peak. BUT...

Cryptocurrency lost more than $640B of value since peaking in January, 2018.

Dot-com stocks lost $1.75T by November, 2000 from they're 52-week high. 

Billions vs. Trillions.

855 2018-10-02 17:47:39 I think in the bigger picture it's negative and telegraphs "risk off".  Which seems impossible as Dow continues to rally but those 30 stocks are meaningless.
856 2018-10-02 17:47:35 We don't care about your stupid ban. Its business as usual. As a matter of fact they're making bump stocks off a 3-D printer and selling them nation wide. You don't obey the law so neither do we. You can do yourself with a red hot poker.
857 2018-10-02 17:47:29 Days like this when the averages are green but popular momenutm stocks are getting hit are mentally exhausting. You constantly want to do something (anything!) instead of just watching for stops to get hit. The waiting is truly the hardest part.

894 2018-10-02 17:33:37 Yup. And not to forget, market cap of $BABA is $415bn, adding up lot of other Chinese stocks listed in the US and you have well over $1 trillion of mkt cap, that can be wiped out from American shareholders at the stroke of a pen in China!
895 2018-10-02 17:33:24 I sincerely hope so. Not a single Marine or NRA member friend or family has cried the sky is falling over things like bump stocks.

2008 was the year when majority of stocks even the good ones were down 70-80% from there respective highs.

937 2018-10-02 17:16:25 That's factually incorrect if you look at how people spend. Middle class spends more locally and nationally, boosting economic advancement as a whole. Rich hoard, invest in offshore accounts, stocks, and tend to spend LESS therefore hurting economic advancements.
938 2018-10-02 17:16:14 Idk, it's more like reverse pumping with bashing a stock you secretly have a position in. There's nothing even wrong with their analysis of this stocks except the badly timed predictions, but these stocks may eventually stop ripping higher on nothing and just crash, so it's risky

961 2018-10-02 17:05:49 Doesn't matter either way. There isn't any "power" in buying unless you're buying stocks, bonds or land. Further, it isn't power at all if a community can't collectively say "No" and mean it. So that number, the magical "Trillion"..is really a baseline for marketers.
962 2018-10-02 17:05:06 And you can bet that the goonerment goonsquad (with @realDonaldTrump help) will not stop at bump stocks - just like they haven't stopped at all the previous incremental moves to take every gun (or to classify everyone as "unfit" to own them...)

2. Your underlying process (critical!)
3. Horizons
4. # of coins
5. Types of coins

1024 2018-10-02 16:40:29 really dont feel like the ban on bump stocks are infringing on the second amendment. besides bump stocks are gimmicky and they’re only fun to use at the range. they’re not practical for a real self defense scenario anyways.
1025 2018-10-02 16:40:28 Take a break in 2019? Odd number years are historically the worst for stocks.
1026 2018-10-02 16:39:35 Sorry to hear that, common theme for these runners seems to be short squeezes. $OGEN in particular coupled with that 1PM conference. You'll bounce back as the market presents you with overextended stocks! Can't wait to see your follow through plays.
1027 2018-10-02 16:39:26 The last time there was such a big performance divergence between small caps $IWM and the Dow $DIA was October 2011
Go look what happened to stocks in October 2011
Hint, it wasn’t good!

1030 2018-10-02 16:38:02 Wow. Stocks are flying 
1031 2018-10-02 16:37:34 our exposure based on our conviction that wealth trends (housing, stocks and bonds) will eventually closely match consumption and labor income trends. We are willing to wait for the markets to come to our idea of value. CAY is one such indicator of the herd's idea of value. 2/2
1032 2018-10-02 16:37:34 “Vermont State Police barracks will still be accepting bump stocks, though anyone who turns them in could face penalties now that the law is in effect”
And that is how you turn law abiding Americans into felons.
1033 2018-10-02 16:36:47 Stocks moving right at the midday. I saw a good entry on both, but i don't like to trade that time of the day : ( $DTEA and $TRPX
1034 2018-10-02 16:34:13 Bump stocks that @BarackObama approved for consumer retail! Where was the out cry then? Why didn't U do something about it then? Was the LV shooting your plan? Seems so odd that all the people involved have been dismissed! DEMS are masters at making people disappear!
1035 2018-10-02 16:33:39 Cannabis stocks going nuts in the past month... I made a couple hundred on the TLRY hype as well. IGC is next in line

1039 2018-10-02 16:33:05 Question to @HalftimeReport @jlebenthal @terranovajoe I own a basket of chip stocks 2 of which are $AMD & $INTC. Does NO one else see that daily algo's switches causing huge daily movements just UNHEALTHY for everything not just 2 stocks. How can businesses run like this??
1040 2018-10-02 16:32:35 Close to 80 percent of the stocks are below the 50 period moving average.
1041 2018-10-02 16:32:11 It amazes me that young kids are more self aware of investments, stocks, real estate than any previous generation. If you’re making money from gaming you need to save or invest as much as you can. I hope your org has financial advisors.
1042 2018-10-02 16:31:42 so can somebody explain stocks to me cause yeah
1043 2018-10-02 16:31:23 No other apps. The stocks app itself is fine, just the widget has this issue. Being on WiFi or mobile data doesn’t make a difference.
1044 2018-10-02 16:31:18 PAGS has held up so well in comparison to emerging markets stocks. May roll my position soon. Also of note today a buy of Dec. 30 Calls

1048 2018-10-02 16:30:34 Take your stocks out though
1049 2018-10-02 16:29:37 2019 plans:

1) My main man @elonmusk does something spectacular in the company that makes my Tesla stocks go to 11.

2) I sell high and thus retire from the grueling world of graphic arts.

3) I then use said funds to purchase a late-19th century haunted mansion to live in.
1050 2018-10-02 16:29:33 In June I bought two pot stocks for $.57. Today those shares are each worth $13.65. Should have bought more pot stocks. #IGC
1051 2018-10-02 16:29:20 It's a wunnerful Woild US$, Gold, Oil, Stocks all going up... cept a few casualties like $RUT and $DJT (leadership of the 2009 Rally) sucking wind... they love those semis today though...
1052 2018-10-02 16:29:15 Another hot pot stock. But too hot? Drug maker $IGC up more than 50% today on hype about a new cannabis-based drink. But beware. It is really starting to look like reefer madness for these stocks. And @CitronResearch is out with cautionary comments about $IGC.
1053 2018-10-02 16:28:47 Our @POTUS is banning bump stocks as per his press conference yesterday but thanks for your concern.
1054 2018-10-02 16:28:04 @FI_InvestIndia @midcap_mantra I don't own any of your favourite stocks but I really appreciate the patience shown during this testing times #dhfl #yesbank #Ibullshousing #pel
1055 2018-10-02 16:27:38 Why go against the trend on the hottest cannabis stocks right now? Instead go bullish over at $YGYI - easy win fella.... sub 6.5m float over there with low valuation.

1059 2018-10-02 16:25:59 The only people voting Democrat are the totally confused and nieve people that only listen to MSM. You people will lose the 1st and 2nd admendment. Seriously you need to look at the economy, stocks, unemployment. Not to mention but now are guilty until proven innocent
1060 2018-10-02 16:25:58 Thanks. Anything else?

On this, it's why my auto stocks have tanked. That's not enough to call it a new deal. Cars being made in US was already a strong move. 62.5 to 75 is not much move for an industry already moving that way... Same w/wages.

Is there more?
1061 2018-10-02 16:25:43 2. No alltime highs more !What will you do when wages will rise not only Amazon and company’s will stop buying in on stocks (with tax cuts money)Earnings turnaround down
You get outvoted and the moral at lowest . Broken trades and skyrocket deficit will be your legacy in history?
1062 2018-10-02 16:24:26 4.1 GDP means a lot.  Plus when you have stocks go up, these companies begin to spend money instead of hold onto it.  And even though it is a global market, it is still the US Stock exchange which means these companies have interest in the US.  Please take an economic class.
1063 2018-10-02 16:23:56 General Electric's market cap has gone from a peak of around $600B market cap to $100B. Half a billion dollars wiped out in one of the most widely owned stocks of all time. Passive investing doesn't always pan out. $GE
1064 2018-10-02 16:23:52 I don’t normally buy stocks with IB, but, let me get this straight.  Buying 5000 shares of a $30 stock would cost $25 in commission with IB, but buying 5000 shares at Fidelity would cost only $4.95.   Not good for IB!   (And they charge extra for data as well)  :)
1065 2018-10-02 16:23:39 Trump is riding the wave started by Obama, just read ppl, stocks up, unemployment down, deficit decreasing, wages ticking up. All happening in 2014-16. With that head wind he is screwing up the deficit. Kept framework of NAFTA tweaked and renamed.  laughing at us.
1066 2018-10-02 16:23:35 everyone while they still have stocks :)
1067 2018-10-02 16:23:33 You didn't respond to anything I said in my response about bump stocks, except with name calling.  You couldn't admit that it's absurd to malign Trump for doing something you approve of.

So, I gave you little taste of your own medicine, so what?
1068 2018-10-02 16:23:20 Jobs are coming back, African American jobless claims are lower than they have been for a while, the stocks have broken multiple records, we are getting control of our borders, Isis has just about been wiped out, huge progress with NoKo...should I keep going?
1069 2018-10-02 16:23:07 Thanks!! Most don't bother looking/leverage ways to personalize. Because of your tweet, I will update, improve and offer more self-service discovery. The link I twitted for the scatter plot feeds off +6,500 stocks. Will try and post the table if possible on Google Sheets.
1070 2018-10-02 16:22:19 We would be rich now if, like I said, you started fund 3 years ago. I was begging. Am better at picking people who can pick stocks than picking stocks. Lookat the crypto nerds getting $ to start rando funds that own 90% bitcoin and the rest silly fake assets. You're 10x smarter..

1074 2018-10-02 16:17:45 Many companies are buying back their stock at a lower price...this isn't helping those who don't understand stocks or are just learning buying an selling stocks. Has nothing to do with how ppl are paid at a job.
1075 2018-10-02 16:17:38 Yup, bravo for those who could afford to invest in the Dow Jones stocks. But what the hell does this do for those who are still struggling to feed and House their families?

1092 2018-10-02 16:10:54 Hey squeler! Since you’ve tweeted this nonsense about bump stocks confirms my initial assumption that it was all BS.
1093 2018-10-02 16:10:47 Why am I still arguing with other gun owners about bump stocks?
1094 2018-10-02 16:10:26 Agreed 100 percent. Can also say that about thousands of fraud stocks whose shares and market caps have been going up for 10 yrs on fraud and propping yo and kicking the can indefinitely, while Americans are absolutely broke.

1096 2018-10-02 16:10:04 Hi Tweeps! Stocks solid today, albeit unexciting! But, whichever way you look at it, the bull run dating back to 2009 can't possibly go on forever!
As always market timing will be key - and, like me, you should use options to tilt the odds in your favor!

1110 2018-10-02 16:06:11 I can't respond because you're rambling. Initially I responded to your comment on bump stocks. You're the sender who rolled it over to "blow jobs" . Anyway who cares, say goodbye.

1112 2018-10-02 16:04:57 Investors,  there are opportunities to invest despite the commentary you might read.  
It's important to understand we are  late cycle,  and the amount of debt risk out there.  So focus on  late cycle stocks, with a very healthy cash reserve, or hedges if experienced.
1113 2018-10-02 16:04:46 Check the evidence, research what is called a pad bet, Soros made one on the Mandalay Bay and make millions off of it, Mandalay Bay CEO sold all of his stocks right before! The shooting was a cover up for something huge, research and you'll find out!

1134 2018-10-02 15:57:01 Trump WAS a gold bug. But, candidate trump also thought Fed reserve was bad,and stocks were a big ugly bubble.
Prez trump,who thinks stocks cant crash, and loves Fed QE, will also flip flop to bashing Gold.
That may be bullish for it,as it makes it cool again,among younger buyers

1152 2018-10-02 15:49:34 Year after Vegas mass shooting, worst in U.S. history, bump stocks are still for sale.

1153 2018-10-02 15:49:30 oil to $100
£ to 1.20 

uk inflation more pressure upwards - likes of food retailers suppress margins further - lower profits - less wage growth - vicious cycle down 

hence avoid uk stocks - except $ earners in energy sector

1171 2018-10-02 15:42:32 I have long call positions in stocks and am using SPX puts expiring tomorrow as a hedge at a known resistance area. If market breaks higher, I close the SPX puts at a loss and let stock calls run. If market breaks down I collect the profit and monitor the supports for my calls.

1175 2018-10-02 15:41:38 Shit, sorry for your loss.  Pulling out at 5% gain is my strategy as lame as that sounds.  I've let it drop to past 10% in the red and it's tuff thinking you'll find a bounce. Better luck tomorrow.  Try Canadian pot stocks they are hot now seeing it will be legal Oct 17.
1176 2018-10-02 15:41:30 I’m a 2nd Amendment fan and supporter, but there’s no reason to allow bump stocks. Either allow civilians to buy machine guns or ban bump stocks. There’s no difference.

If you are going to regulate those out I hope part of your regulation is opening the NFA for new machine guns.

1276 2018-10-02 15:13:54 Stupid shits in Congress cannot ban bump stocks, good luck getting them to do anything worthwhile to keep guns from abusers or mentally ill.
1277 2018-10-02 15:13:02 You suppose trading everyday with your technical analysis in 20 years you would have made more money than those small stocks?
1278 2018-10-02 15:12:42 Hey Gopi, don't worry, we would be having enough stocks for our fans. Stay tuned to Flipkart on 11th October 2018, midnight as we can't ensure. Thanks
1279 2018-10-02 15:12:34 ... today it may be a small stock but eventually it becomes a small stock. AAPL didn't start at $1000s/share it started below $100.

I USED TO avoid "small" stocks because of liquidity. That sifted out a lot of "growth" stocks. Now I just buy what goes up even if it's R0.50...
1280 2018-10-02 15:12:16 Why does banning bump stocks take over a year but babies are put in cages at the stroke of a pen.
1281 2018-10-02 15:11:37 Market facts: 

S&P rose for six months April to September for only sixth time since 1928.  Each of those times it has gone up the remainder of the year!

1313 2018-10-02 15:05:09 have we ever had a real recovery (outside of stocks)? Not anywhere close.
1314 2018-10-02 15:04:51 Mostly due to over reaction to earnings, also the Chinese tech stocks, while great to hold are not immune to their home market shift, they're also preparing to return to A shares and list in the Asian exchanges
1315 2018-10-02 15:04:31 So its pretty smart to invest now while its still pretty cheap. I like crypto way more then Stocks. I know its not necessarily the same thing but I totally do not understand how the platform thing works. And thanks for the help @JohnnyZcash

1334 2018-10-02 15:00:44 Disagree. Companies... particularly smaller companies will have more to expand invest and boost future earnings. And although stocks have historically always outperformed vs other asset classes, the margin of outperformance for US equities will widen for the foreseable future.

1344 2018-10-02 14:57:30 I'm just confused. They're purchasing an investment that's taxable when liquidated, just like literally any stock, house, or investment vehicle.

If they choose to never liquidate, well, that's their problem. I don't sell stocks all that often either. 

Why is this a scam?

1403 2018-10-02 14:36:01 If you knew your timeframe for investing was minimum of 20 years, I believe stocks would be a better risk reward than most. Risk is reduced if the investing timefram is much longer. Most should have a timeframe of over 30 years but are not willing/able to implement.
1404 2018-10-02 14:35:32 In The Market: The 3rd quarter for US #stocks was amazing in a few fronts. A 7.7% gain w/ dividends (7.2% w/o) makes it the best since Q4 2013, @LPL CIO John Lynch notes. Plus, #sp500 didn't close up or down 1% on any day, 1st time since 1963 #volatility #nyse #investing #trading

1408 2018-10-02 14:33:48 I think one thing u can do is find some stocks, I’d recommend Fang and other big names. Study their patterns. Learn where support & resistance are. Watch them live if possible & see what you think is going to happen vs what actually does. It’s a process of being in the action

1419 2018-10-02 14:29:54 Oh that's not disrespect, That's actually a legit reply. I know why she was asking, but these things take time was his essential reply. No matter what she was going to say after that, these things take time. They have to legally define bump stocks. Now as easy as it sounds.

1422 2018-10-02 14:29:31 Lots of debate in policy circles. One of the weird parts of our current economic time is that large corporations are using their revenue to buy back their stocks (to increase the stock price) instead of reinvesting it in their workers or research or new equipment.

1455 2018-10-02 14:19:50 My goal with trading is consistent gains with minimal drawdown. I don't aim for large gains on individual trades and instead focus on reducing tail risk events. Because of those criteria I limit the stocks I trade to large caps with positive earnings.

Bump stocks were widely considered a no-brainer until the NRA got in Trump's ear after Las Vegas. This is why we say the NRA has blood on its hands.

1526 2018-10-02 13:54:54 Could use a stocks and shares ISA - no tax on gains. I wonder if it’s better to reduce the balance when less interest is payable or wait until rates go up and utilise gains from investment to overpay at that point

1535 2018-10-02 13:47:56 Stocks ripped higher yesterday. Kicking off Q4 w a new N American trade agreement as rocket fuel. As if they needed more propellant.

1545 2018-10-02 13:44:35 Trend was just an easy example... the question is whether there are many or few examples and whether they move the needle. I personally think it depends. If stocks are cheap, time horizon is long, and/or behavior is good... absolutely no need. I personally question that now.

1555 2018-10-02 13:42:35 It’s healthy to have consolidation every now and then. We don’t want growth stocks going straight up every day, do we? (Recall April 2000 and February 2018)

1561 2018-10-02 13:41:06 An alternative perspective for trend is that the optimal portfolio is far from static... the optimal portfolio is heavily skewed towards stocks when stocks are in an up trend and the optimal portfolio is heavily skewed towards bonds when stocks are in a down trend.

1566 2018-10-02 13:39:55 Yesterday a 30 stock average (the Dow) was up 193 points, while a 2000 stock average (the Russell) was down 1.39% below its 50-day line. Only 42% of NASDAQ stocks are above their 50-day lines. The broader market is quietly correcting. Let's hope it doesn't get too loud.

3. All news is bullish
4. The Fed will never do anything to hurt stocks
5.  The Fed gives 12 weeks notice before raising rates

1593 2018-10-02 13:31:24 And the whole argument to fish right up to MSY confuses me - defining some fish stocks as "Underexploited" or "Moderately exploited" surely aren't the right terms to use when talking about sustainability. We exploit one fishery, then move to the next and so on. When does it stop?
1594 2018-10-02 13:31:18 The Dow is capturing headlines, but more than half of NASDAQ stocks are below their 200-day lines.  With II bulls at 61% and few stocks in low risk buyable position, I view this market as risky. If the Dow continues its "lone wolf" rally, I would sell into the strength.
1595 2018-10-02 13:31:15 Trend is the perfect example for this discussion. If trend allows for improved risk adjusted performance vs stocks (and even materially lower returns) then leverage would allow trend to have higher return at the same risk or the same return for less risk than stocks.

1644 2018-10-02 13:01:21 Many new traders are drawn to supposedly undervalued stocks trading at or near their 52 week lows. Be careful most are there for a good reason.

1648 2018-10-02 12:59:34 So my friend asked some advise on investment, stocks, and insurance. Is this a sign for a career shift 
1649 2018-10-02 12:58:50 Thanks. Just picked up 46 from my local newsagent in Blackburn Mall as its only place that stocks it. To be honest I’ve not seen any issues in any newsagent or WHS since around issue 10. That’s for the whole NW England region. Very difficult to get hold of

1660 2018-10-02 12:55:05 Traders tendency to look at, gloat over, profits they made and forget, sweep under the carpet, the losses in the process!
Vested interests game different: by circulating selective profits sheets, they seek to grow their equity. Either increase subscription or to puff up stocks!

They might try to keep these stocks down--let's see if we can obtain a stable $300 target first.

 They're underestimating us 'Millennials'  =) More of us will enter the stock market as they gain access to wealth, form families, and low cost investment fees.

1668 2018-10-02 12:51:25 And facebook is worth 469 Billion?  Stocks trade at values often high multiples of their assets... in this case Tesla is worth so much because of the future that people are hoping for - taking over train industry with Semi trucks, automated cars - destroying Uber, solar, grid etc

1690 2018-10-02 12:42:00 $IGC all of you that think you're saving money with robinhood. This is common for stocks to dump before 9:00am. You need to get a real brokerage.

1695 2018-10-02 12:40:13 For what I know about US politics ... I think that stocks are more driven by market sentiment and Fed upbeat tone from one side and tariffs drag from the other side right now. Elections shouldn't sway it too much per se.

1776 2018-10-02 11:50:12 Look for stocks that pay dividend and are cheap, open a brokerage account, and allocate an amount every month. You need monthly decipline in order to your equity portfolio.

1810 2018-10-02 11:29:23 Kinda a weird thing I have noticed with stocks the past year or so - earnings announced, earnings are good or great, stock goes down and then within a few days, it goes back up. Can't explain it, but watch it happen all the time. Whether it's automation, manipulation, who knows.
1811 2018-10-02 11:29:08 I wonder how Trump’s base is going to react to him banning bump stocks? Maybe this is the thing that will get them to turn on him?

1814 2018-10-02 11:25:46 You are aware that a bump stock does not increase the rate of fire of any weapon right? 

Bump stocks are a gimmick and you don't need a "bump stock" to bump fire a weapon. You can fire any gun just as fast, maybe faster, without a bump stock.
1815 2018-10-02 11:24:18 Yes, but now SM acquired more than 50% of Million Market's stocks making them the major shareholder of MM.

Lots of really bad strategies in there, like buying stocks with the highest valuations and bad earnings quality.

1842 2018-10-02 11:05:20 When I was doing my master's degree, I started to get interested in stocks but since I don't have enough money , I decided to set it aside for the mean time.

1843 2018-10-02 11:04:20 You lost me with "His tax cut, jammed through last year, continues to juice a red hot economy that has consumers confident, stocks soaring, joblessness sinking."
1844 2018-10-02 11:04:19 we will all have the same problem. Unless ofcourse your statement of a one year hold is waterproof I know it works like this in stocks, where you just pay your (too high) broker-fee, but crypto is still another world.

1850 2018-10-02 10:59:22 For sure. Try to keep a “nothing’s stopping me” mentality during the set, but none of your mental energy should be spent thinking while playing. Just short comments between stocks is good

1877 2018-10-02 10:30:35 This is due to the lower yield and lack of demand within more traditional outlets. ETFs greatly expose interest rate risks to investors. While investors have no alternatives to stocks which push them up the risk grid.

1990 2018-10-02 08:49:35 Supply for tokens can be infinite and demand is sketchy at best. There is no real demand. Most demand emanates from speculative buyers wanting to buy low and sell high. No real demand or real hodlers. For example I know people who owns apple stocks for last 25 years
1991 2018-10-02 08:48:08 1/2 The tricky thing with crypto is that you're not valuing stocks... You're valuing a utility or even a currency, even with a working product, and let's say volume goes through the roof, what's to say that price should go up as selling and buying volume may just net off
1992 2018-10-02 08:47:15 It really is expensive. But I saw Pick n PAY now stocks up on it and it's relatively cheaper than Dischem and Clicks.

1997 2018-10-02 08:44:46 It never got that far. But there was a willingness on the part of Republicans, including the president if I remember correctly, to ban bump stocks Even the NRA was open to the idea. But the Dems were talking about limiting magazine capacity etc... So, as with so much: Nothing.

Moral of story: buy good stocks. Don’t sell just because of market volatility.
2006 2018-10-02 08:35:37 Wonder whether anyone has got their head around misselling of crypto yet. @PL_Malta and @MaltaGov made such a hullabaloo about misselling of sale of stocks & shares yet no word about misselling of the most volatile asset class yet.

2140 2018-10-02 06:41:02 And most probably #VaR  of those stocks is close to historic lows, just  like before the crash 10 years ago. Is everything different now?

2143 2018-10-02 06:39:20 Short sellers/media manipulate stocks to get ill  gains from this. SEC NEEDS TO INVESTIGATE THIS ASAP. (Of course if the system isn’t rigged and sec isn’t working together with media)

2148 2018-10-02 06:36:22 For those old-enough to remember, we have already been there! Signs of excesses everywhere, increasingly similar to late 90's, with #Crypto "currencies" taking the role of .com #stocks. But it may keep going upwards...until it ends in tears.
2149 2018-10-02 06:34:43 Wake up, how can you be so oblivious to what’s happening?  First all Dems said if Trump got elected stocks would crash and the economy would tank. Now that it’s better than ever, it’s not because of Trump. Who are you trying to fool?  Yourself?
2150 2018-10-02 06:32:46 Beautiful ceremony tonight in Vegas where people gathered at the site of the attack to shoot ARs modified with bump stocks into the windows of the Mandalay Bay.

2152 2018-10-02 06:30:12 Rep. Karlo Nograles #AngProbinsyano: Aside from announcing the additional importation of rice stocks that are expected to arrive in November, the NFA said the incoming supply would “increase NFA’s active participation in the market by as much as 20 percent.” | #KarloNograles
2153 2018-10-02 06:29:44 He was also one of the few who was very worried about highly over valued mid/small cap stocks.

2155 2018-10-02 06:29:19 A good number of local papers are saying that with #USD/IRR dropping in #Iran, small investors' money will go to #stocks. They seem to miss the fact, however, that one of stocks' primary drivers was a weaker currency and now shares could be overpriced in rial terms.

2159 2018-10-02 06:23:14 I say we put that money you got from chipotle stocks into making that brilliant idea happen here
2160 2018-10-02 06:23:09 Did we say we wanted to be paid? No. I'll put what I said in a way that even someone too poor to invest in proper stocks(you) can understand: We are a free service, so we are under no obligation to do jack because someone wants to do. If we were a paid service, maybe. Kay? Fool.
2161 2018-10-02 06:22:54 People said the same about Nike, and now looks. Their stocks are sky, highest they've ever been. get a grip.
2162 2018-10-02 06:22:14 There is the fund raise associated with the Novum appointment. Not too bad a price but its more the doldrums the stock has been forced to hang in that's kept it from moving forward. Been a few of these Novum appointments with other stocks of late too so heads up all #TEK
2163 2018-10-02 06:21:00 That's a BS excuse! Banning assault rifles, bump stocks along with stricter backround checks doesn't violate an ounce of your 2A. FYI...99.99% of mass shootings aren't committed by "criminals" they're the White next door neighbor. And criminals can't get one if they're illegal.
2164 2018-10-02 06:20:52 #Asian stocks were mixed Tuesday after a muted #US trading session, with #Japanese shares extending gains as the $JPY remained under pressure! The $USD pushed higher as emerging-market currencies slid, led by Indonesia’s rupiah $IDR!

2190 2018-10-02 05:59:00 Hadn't started on anything yet. So Paytm has me sorted on MFs. Need to figure the stocks thing. And since dad's going to be recommending stuff for now while I learn, doesn't make sense to go with the banks with the commission fee.
2191 2018-10-02 05:58:03 If they're smart, and make enough money, invest in stocks and property and live comfortably as a rentier for the rest of your life. If not, the increasingly desperate field of doing appearances in smaller venues you see many celebrtities do.

2196 2018-10-02 05:54:48 But what if you lose money in the stock market? You can lose more in stocks then you can with inflation. Just sayin’

First clear your thoughts and have facts than jump.

2201 2018-10-02 05:50:53 Is 'value investing' possible in established and well-discovered company stocks? For example, Bajaj Fin, Britannia, Mariti is still expensive in PE, PB level after this severe correction.

2249 2018-10-02 05:19:33 The only way to enforce a ban on bump-stocks would be an unconstitutional search of every building and vehicle in America.

That's not going to happen, but it illustrates how stupid a ban on bump-stocks would be.

2268 2018-10-02 05:08:36 @TheBullBull why is ipca falling (from 630 to above 800 and now at 668)? Is there any bad news? Other pharma stocks are relatively stable.
2269 2018-10-02 05:08:25 I said ‘made’ better finances; O improved economy vastly compared to T just standing on his shoulders.
Wages are still low. GDP can be high with a poor population (and doesn’t count in the enormous increase in deficit). Stocks doing good benefits stockowners only.
Drop Fox’ bias.

2278 2018-10-02 05:03:20 Actually, “bump stock” is a shooting technique and not a product.  Things sold as bump stocks really only male bump stocking hurt your hands and arms less...kinda like @CopperFit w/o the copper. The ban does nothing to prevent bump stocking—can’t ban a technique.
2279 2018-10-02 05:00:12 Have you outlawed bump stocks yet?

2351 2018-10-02 04:01:02 I see the govt. is getting around to banning bump stocks. Imo it is a novelty item anyway. No accuracy or hunting value. As long as this placates the left and  they don't demand the AR's too it should be ok.

2357 2018-10-02 03:56:10 IMO, the extreme risk people are willing to take by putting money in Crypto & Penny stocks, the loss aversion is not as strong.

2391 2018-10-02 03:34:55 I would like to apologise for not paying any attention to the market today during trading hours, or having any opinion on movements of metals prices or mining stocks 

To be clear, I would like to apologise but I can't. Because it was bloody great to not give a fcuk for the day.

2395 2018-10-02 03:31:17 We need to define what markets, what stocks/indices we will be trading. Then decide do we trade rangebound or trending markets. Then we need to see if we take reversal trades or trend trades. And backtest them to see if we can really make 3R,4R,5R trading those markets.
2396 2018-10-02 03:29:56 @USATODAY BUMP STOCKS DO NOT MAKE A FIREARM MAGICALLY INTO A FULL AUTO RIFLE.  there is no such thing as a "machine gun" STOP USING MISNOMER SCARE TACTICS.  bump stocks make a rifle so inaccurate it's blind dumb luck a bullet strikes it's target!
2397 2018-10-02 03:29:10 Yes it is. Their economy is capricious at to say the least. Chinese stocks are down 20% this year as well. They are using an effective Debt Growth strategy that has kept their fires going, but if it stops...

#ElonMusk steps down as Chairman. #TSLA stocks rise ever since.
It was a fine of $40m, they say?
Elon Musks new tweet suggests he’s just ‘fine’
2401 2018-10-02 03:24:08 Lol. He didn't save the auto industry. Ford did fine. GM closed their profitable medium duty line so they could file bankruptcy paid for by the tax payer. All of the GM stocks got wiped out. Obama was a joke..
2402 2018-10-02 03:23:50 one Nees as many screens as they want and need to be comfortable with everything up that they like to have up without having to minimize or move anything.. Some people like to have diff things up.. Like me for instance I like to have a bunch of stocks up in diff time frames
2403 2018-10-02 03:23:47 I want to ask you 1 thing regarding stocks. If someone finds intrinsic value of a stock using DCF model and trades solely based off it, how risky is that in the long run?
2404 2018-10-02 03:23:27 Jesus, these ledes suck. Could’ve written, “Elon has the same amount of money today as he did Thursday”. Stocks go up and down. Stop writing garbage clickbait titles!

The ability to have stocks in the cannabis business is a mark towards FINANCIAL progress.

2409 2018-10-02 03:21:05 Yes. LTF trading in stocks will show you your place real quick. Reading the level 2 and order flow becomes paramount. HTF swings take on new risk with overnight risk added that crypto isn't accustomed to. Its a different animal.
2410 2018-10-02 03:20:56 Only bad people need tha devil's endorsements. How sad is that? Thank God for President Trump and the great majority that support him and the accomplishments he's achieving for us. Today it was doubly nice. The Trade agreement with Canada and Stocks reach all time high.

2432 2018-10-02 03:11:36 True. I think of crypto as something that opened doors for me to a profession that I enjoy regardless of profit and loss. Once well experienced in trading crypto with play money, I've decided to diversify to stocks and commodities.

2443 2018-10-02 03:04:57 2/.  Removing treasury bonds meant that money didn’t have a place to park, so money went into other assets - especially stocks and real estate.  Re-inflating those prices.  And The Fed buying mortgage backed securities meant banks were relieved of their crap assets, ...
2444 2018-10-02 03:03:35 After decades trading the markets almost every successful trader develops a 'ZERO loyalty to stocks mindset'.

2447 2018-10-02 03:02:41 We do not care what celebrities think. Why don't you all get that? The creators of "me too" when actually it's "we knew"!

2457 2018-10-02 02:58:50 That’s obviously unrealistic. Require background check, raise the minimum age for buying guns and ban bump stocks to decrease the gun related deaths. 
And the wall wouldn’t help our drug problem, Almost all of it comes by mail. Legalizing marijuana would help it.

2461 2018-10-02 02:57:22 The economy is indeed a battleship that takes a while to turn, but the actions, and even more importantly, the ANTICIPATED actions of a POTUS can have a profound and somewhat immediate impact on the economy. Witness the upswing in stocks almost as soon as Trump was elected.

2468 2018-10-02 02:53:45 The bump stock is almost gone. Almost. Not quite, but almost. So buyers out there, this is your opportunity ... Go get your bump stocks while quantities last.

2486 2018-10-02 02:39:47 It's even more closely correlated to the S&P but unfortunately Bonds' correlation to both stocks and oil can swing from extreme positive to extreme negative.

2516 2018-10-02 02:18:13 Now now, getting you and all of your ilk into the stocks will do! Somewhere with good disabled access. How about at the #FestivalOfBrexitBritain? We will have a lot of rotten fruit to throw  at you. No other entertainment will be required.
2517 2018-10-02 02:17:38 And the ding dang bump stocks still legal. Mind blown about the stranglehold @NRA has on our political system. Blood on their hands. Thank goodness for @Everytown, their mission and elected officials like you.

2522 2018-10-02 02:14:38 Apparently last year’s thoughts and prayers didn’t work out. The “bump stocks” that were to be outlawed at state and national levels are still for sale. Machine guns for all?

2530 2018-10-02 02:12:29 Yeah but why you never cover how the shorts manipulate the stocks so they can cash in? That is also Tesla related....
2531 2018-10-02 02:11:42 Yup. In the US they are selling cannabis. In Canada we are selling cannabis stocks. My thesis remains: Countries will baby their industries to give domestic producers a chance before opening borders. Canada as global dominators is not a given, like many will tell you.
2532 2018-10-02 02:10:55 Volume is less in most of the stocks in yesterday's uptrend.. So tomorrow market is very well in downtrend

2534 2018-10-02 02:10:09 We know he had 22 semi-automatic rifles with him in the hotel room overlooking the concert, and 14 of them were equipped with bump stocks. AND bump stocks are still legal (so far). There’s lots of places to start from. Addressing the weapon possession is a good place to start.

2536 2018-10-02 02:08:17 I call BS, I don’t see pot stocks going down at all. The time to invest is NOW, while the weed stocks are under $10. Its only up from here 
2537 2018-10-02 02:08:14 Ok thanks! And did u check out the ub40 situation? Your peeps are laughing stocks! This is surreal. Really. The Gamble vs US case coming up can’t be worth this disaster can it?
2538 2018-10-02 02:07:08 No wonder they're chasing "hope" stocks that have even profitless growth. Growth is scarce these days. We're in a world with a scarcity of both (1) secular growth and (2) yield. All these engineered phony yield plays out there too. Tough time to be an investor.
2539 2018-10-02 02:05:46 I dont look at stocks very rarely cant keep up with it, but its pretty crazy Snap is declining like that, I thought the younger generation prefers it over and it could only grow from where it was. Do you own any? would you invest in Twitter? lol

2551 2018-10-02 01:56:50 My approach to bonds is pretty much like my approach to stocks. If I can’t understand something, I tend to forget it. Passing an opportunity which I don’t understand - even if someone else is perceptive enough to analyze it and get paid well for doing it - doesn’t bother me.
2552 2018-10-02 01:56:01 None of the patterns I am profitable work with higher priced stocks. There used to be no issue with at least 2/3 of the stocks I watch but now there is barely anything. If it is just a temporary thing its fine otherwise ill need a new broker
2553 2018-10-02 01:55:34 Why is no one reporting that the rules on bump stocks are in their final phase of being changed as President Trump reported today? Since it is the one year anniversary, but no one will admit he’s fixing that issue also

2566 2018-10-02 01:46:38 My first was buying dips at support levels on stocks that were in multi day breakouts. But one of my favorites is the gap down below a previous day low, then reclaims that low and fills the gap
2567 2018-10-02 01:44:39 RBI regulations say the promoters of Bandhan Bank must reduce their shareholding below 40%. SEBI regulation bars them from selling stocks until March 209. No-win situation. RBI and SEBI too must HELP resolve this, not merely enforce their respective regulations.

2573 2018-10-02 01:42:45 Remember when trump said banning bump stocks was a good as done....just another lie we need reminding about.

It's OK if one can't short stocks in a falling #market. 

In a 10 year period, in 7-8 markets are mostly rising. 

If markets are FLAT or downward for 10 years, u will have MUCH bigger issues to deal with outside trading

2587 2018-10-02 01:35:04 In a truly just society, Rupert Murdoch would be placed in stocks in the public square for the damage he & Fox have done to America.

The USA has a SCOTUS nominee who has lied under oath.

# track their biz cycles
# deploy cash at reasonable valuations
# increase base

2594 2018-10-02 01:32:28 At least it's not Clinton.

Though to be fair, Obama did approve bump stocks on two separate occasions. Republicans seem to be more capable of protecting the 2nd when a Democrat is president.

2609 2018-10-02 01:22:30 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump  "Making Bump-Stocks Illegal"...is supposed to "Stop" mass-murderers...Right? Our 2nd Amendment states-"Shall Not Be Infringed!"

2612 2018-10-02 01:20:27 The only reason people buy bump stocks is because you promote them.

2614 2018-10-02 01:19:23 How about the GOP put a ban on bump stocks for starters!
2615 2018-10-02 01:18:34 The ATF ruled in 2010 that bump stocks were not a firearm subject to  regulation and allowed their sale as an unregulated firearm part. Let's see 2010.. Obama was president! FBI needs to investigate your CHICOM employee.
2616 2018-10-02 01:17:18 Sorry for your loss sir but the role the NRA plays is waging their battle for less gun control background checks and promoting the sale of semi automatic assault rifles. I am a gun collector but I agree that there is no logical use for the AR-15 type rifles and bump stocks.

2620 2018-10-02 01:14:56 y’all had a whole year and couldn’t even ginup the courage to go after bump stocks; i assume you’re questioning the GOP priorities in defending an unfit SCOTUS pick instead of lifting not even a finger on mass shootings.

2634 2018-10-02 01:03:59 Have you asked why the @BarackObama admin gave the green light to bump stocks?  The NRA supported a ban, what’s your excuse? Do you actually make laws or do you just campaign on Twitter to people who can’t read more than 240 char without getting bored?
2635 2018-10-02 01:03:34 #PSE - oil play...hmmm dont know whats goign now....telco serye....hmmm no idea... but the stocks related when sky high for nothing.... casino play..well..il be with #LR now.. but the game is Makati Subway #IRC.. :)
2636 2018-10-02 01:03:03 Already said before. Stocks you can reissue. You cannot reverse a burn. World of difference.
2637 2018-10-02 01:00:58 and so we return to "stock price justifies stock price".

what other stocks you like, bro?
2638 2018-10-02 01:00:55 Something is better than nothing, but it's the high-capacity magazines that make bump stocks dangerous. A bump stock with a small mag means more time changing mags than shooting.
2639 2018-10-02 00:58:45 Marc may be right but I think there are so many better stocks to play, & with intensification of global warming i wldnt want to be involved in tsla's demise. Bad mojo.
2640 2018-10-02 00:57:13 And Kavanaugh would be the deciding vote to say banning bump stocks is unconstitutional. Although when the constitution was written, the biggest weapon was a musket.

2643 2018-10-02 00:55:26 I do t like tobacco stocks either. Sold $mj because they invest in it. Shoulda researched earlier.  Tobacco should go. It has nothing good about it. I’ve never used cannabis either.

2645 2018-10-02 00:54:47 Scott Wagner also used campaign money to invest in private stocks and then lost that money. We need a Governor who isn't a greedy and shady! We need one that isn't bad with money choices. And we have one already! I choose to keep our Governor!
2646 2018-10-02 00:54:41 If you’re a 20% taxpayer now & are likely to be a 20% taxpayer in retirement then the tax benefit is severely reduced & you may benefit from greater flexibility of a stocks & shares ISA. If you’re looking to buy your 1st home then open a lifetime ISA too

2648 2018-10-02 00:53:43 So when the comeback kept getting delayed, stocks were affected somehow

2653 2018-10-02 00:49:21 Honest answer is I don’t know followed by the right answer : if ur staring at this all day, ur position size is too big.  These stocks need loose grips to absorb the shocks.  And there will be shocks.  The seismic kind, sometimes.  So if -25% is scary vs exciting, u too big.
2654 2018-10-02 00:48:17 Stocks up nice today. :)
2655 2018-10-02 00:48:02 I heard the president today say they are close to a deal banning bump stocks at the press conference to the NAFTA deal. Are you sure you have your facts straight.
2656 2018-10-02 00:48:01 Happy Birthday to our Varsity Boys Basketball Coach, Jeff Stocks!
2657 2018-10-02 00:47:09 what legislation that does not infringe on Constitutional rights would have prevented this?
People bump fire without bump fire stocks so that legislation is useless. A double action revolver is considered “semi-automatic...you gonna ban those as well?
#LiberalEchoChamber
2658 2018-10-02 00:46:44 There's already a ban on assault weapons without the proper licensing No automatic weapona were used in the mass shooting I recall there has been work bump stocks. Would it be better that the two parties start bringing the country together than what has been going on lately

2673 2018-10-02 00:39:27 you know it’s been a year since the Las Vegas shooting and you can still buy bump stocks, regardless of the fact that there are 59 reasons to ban them.
2674 2018-10-02 00:38:36 And common sense gun control hasn’t budged an inch!
bump stocks are still for sale, even though @potus promised to outlaw them!
More empty words from @VP @GOP and those beholden to their @nra masters
2675 2018-10-02 00:38:16 Background checks are mandatory and instant in all 50 states. California laws are violating the 2nd amendment. I'm in the NRA and you can ban bump stocks all you want they are just a junk toy.
2676 2018-10-02 00:37:47 Many of the strong stocks I was watching had bearish engulfing candles today as if people were doing that across the board. What’s your take on that?
2677 2018-10-02 00:37:01 Energy stocks saw significant strength, benefiting from a sharp increase by the price of crude oil – @ConocoPhillips leapt 3.2%, Marathon Oil rose 2.5%, @Chevron gained 1.7%, and @Occidental, Schulmberger and @ExxonMobil all added about 1%.

2681 2018-10-02 00:35:56 Hey #mushroomdick what happened to banning bump stocks???? Your masters @NRA  are broke. How are they going to pay for your services?

2683 2018-10-02 00:34:04 He just said today bump stocks are being banned @KamalaHarris   You must have blacked out when @realDonaldTrump was talking today.
2684 2018-10-02 00:33:13 @DavidMuir you guys are ridiculous. Do you know how few and far between bump stocks are? You guys over here reporting and acting like every gun owner has/uses one #dramatic #banidiotsnotguns 
2685 2018-10-02 00:32:14 I remember a white guy with a gun equipped with bump stocks committed the largest mass shooting in American history. We actually know a lot more than you think.
2686 2018-10-02 00:31:59 I’m going to buy stocks in Kleenex ..... just sayin
2687 2018-10-02 00:31:05 So Amazon after getting $40 million back from thier tax break and buying more stocks making thier share holders richer finally gave thier employees a $20-40 a week raise wow don't spend it all in one place
2688 2018-10-02 00:30:39 FBI says he used bump fire stocks. Victims say they heard pop, pop, pop. Bump fire doesn't go pop, pop, pop so who is lying?We've seen how the weaponized, biased FBI operates.We are self governing people, the unelected, unconstitutional apointees have to go!

2690 2018-10-02 00:29:27 Worse, @GOP said they would #DoSomething but they did nothing. Bump stocks are still legal. Background checks aren't always done. American teens can buy AR-15s from strangers in parking lots & ammo magazines as easily as if buying bubble gum.

2695 2018-10-02 00:26:18 So, Rober Schiller doesn't like stocks then? 
2696 2018-10-02 00:25:08 Bump stocks make bump firing easier with less practice. But it's very doable without them. People do it and do it well all the time with little to no tools at all. Trying to prevent bump firing by banning bump stocks is like trying to prevent hot water by banning microwaves.
2697 2018-10-02 00:22:58 Many rumors about crypto new applications. For instance, main food chains are making farmers to pay w. cryptos to identify grain stocks w. salmonela so they can stop the spreading. Also in Japan student loans are made w. cryptos.

2703 2018-10-02 00:18:31 Sad. This should be a unifying message but #DoNothingDean has once again done nothing aside from offerering prayers and making proclamations. He promised to work to ban bump stocks. Still nothing, one year later.

2723 2018-10-02 00:08:55 Do you trade any stocks in particular or just the indexes?
Do you use the same exit strategy for your trailing stops or do you have a different approach to exits depending on what instrument you’re trading?
2724 2018-10-02 00:08:16 We know bump stocks should be banned. Even Trump said so - but then caved.
2725 2018-10-02 00:07:27 US stocks closed higher on the back of the new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), replacing the NAFTA. #morninghuddle
2726 2018-10-02 00:07:25 So bump stocks used in the massacre of people, have tough rules & regulations, that take over a year to ban, but putting kids in internment camps he did overnight? #GunReformNow #FamiliesBelongTogether #WhereAreTheChildren
2727 2018-10-02 00:07:15 And our President says the following:. " in order to eliminate -- terminate -- bump stocks, we have to go through procedure. We are now at the final stages of that procedure," he said.   Another lie I am sure but he will say anything to get elected again
2728 2018-10-02 00:06:04 Trump says he's finalizing a ban on bump stocks.  This is not what I elected him for.  I understand the need to compromise on some issues to find a middle ground, but this is not one of those issues.

2732 2018-10-02 00:03:39 Yes, @DonaldJTrumpJr , please talk to your father, you know its not about the bump stocks in general, its everything that follows. They are using bump stocks as the vehicle to everything else. NO TO ANY anti  2A bills or backdoor laws. UNCONSTITUTIONAL.
2733 2018-10-02 00:03:25 President Trump made GREAT deal with CA PM and the stocks were up and booming this day is truly GREAT for the president and the American people Trump holding a rally in TN and with STRONG confidence in America we can thrive and if you want this to continue we NEED to vote

2736 2018-10-02 00:01:36 And the 2A crowd are still saying there is no need to ban bump stocks because they are no faster than a human doing it manually. (Heard that claim on an NPR show yesterday!)
2737 2018-10-02 00:01:23 Follow me now. What if the US didn't have an insane number of guns and automatic guns and huge amounts of ammo and bump stocks, so we could reduce the number of times anyone has to run into gunfire? Nuts, huh?
2738 2018-10-02 00:00:19 EDZ
-i will see what it does tuesday and hope to get in under 52 and sell around 55.4 for a 6% gain. It is about to bounce off the trend line as well as a resistance line. High chance of success.
