I was comparing it to the stocks I own. I'd never buy shares in a company so opaque.

104 2018-10-07 22:17:43 An interesting topic in the Ninth district: the underfunded 'pension crisis'. Institutional money managers expect 1 to 4 % real returns for us stocks and bonds over next 7-10 years (see GMO,llc and others). Yet Minneapolis and other district municipal plans expect 7.5 to 8%.

196 2018-10-07 20:12:29 This is certainly one I could see disobeying the general laws of TA. Some stocks just leave everyone hoping to load up on the pullback that never really comes. This may be that stock.
197 2018-10-07 20:11:38 logically yes, but it seems with certain big boy stocks i tend to ignore the R/R that i know i SHOULD adhere to... and i don't honour my stoploss as much when i'm chasing a big P/L... no no more! new week, new mish 
198 2018-10-07 20:09:22 I'm a primarily long trader, but if I do short I will use options so that my risk is capped. Shorting stocks has unlimited risk. I always go for the best risk vs reward I can find. UVXY calls were Friday's best trade.

269 2018-10-07 18:51:48 Just think about South Africa. Don't follow the situation very closely, but things might get very ugly there which may make stocks like Naspers even cheaper... I've been increasing exposure to EM funds lately, which hopefully will be seen as a good entry point long-term

274 2018-10-07 18:47:23 See I operate on a wait and see, policy by policy basis.  I want to see the long term benefits of those cuts but right now my stocks are giving me lovely returns, I live in a state where those cuts probably will be mitigated from other taxes though.

277 2018-10-07 18:44:29 Bush gave the Dems everything. That’s why we are in such debt. That’s why the stocks and housing crashed. He never said no to them. And Obama continued. For the first time the Dems heard “no” and are freaking out.

282 2018-10-07 18:39:25 Debatable. Traditional funds with an ETF share class (Vanguard patent) can sell stocks with capital losses on the fund side and book the lose. ETF only products do not.
283 2018-10-07 18:39:10 I have no idea if $SPX is going to collapse, go sideways or rip from here...but what I know for sure is that Growth vs Value flipped and will continue to catch people offsides. Long value short growth is the trade now. However pick your value stocks wisely. Avoid leverage.

318 2018-10-07 18:16:40 Indeed, but when your baseline includes 89% drawdown in stocks from the 1929 peak to the 1932 trough, you're working from a pretty robust baseline.

Yes, markets could go down 90% over the next 3 years from here. But if that happens, I suspect retirement isn't our biggest worry?

514 2018-10-07 15:40:00 To all buyers on this GO, me and @Min07Young are really sorry if we weren't able to get all the merchs. We really tried our best. We haven't sleep just to queue in the line early but the stocks they have are limited on both days. Hoping for ur understanding. Thanks . 
515 2018-10-07 15:38:23 And that will change the ruling how?  You people  are the laughing stocks of the country  and don't  even know it.
516 2018-10-07 15:38:05 those stocks are pretty much the only thing you need to watch during a chop period.  Be alert for a 2 to 4 day undercut of logical support area.  That's how shake outs occur.
517 2018-10-07 15:37:24 Malheureusement c’est arrivé à plusieurs personnes, il y aurait eu un problème dans un de leurs stocks, certains les ont et d’autres non... Je te conseille d’aller te faire rembourser ou échanger en t’assurant que ce soit un bon cette fois ci 
518 2018-10-07 15:37:22 Reminds me of what Warren Buffet said. "When people start recommending stocks to portfolio managers, it's time to book and vice versa" XD
519 2018-10-07 15:36:42 With  very  decent  correction  do u think  one should  enter  at this level  in some good  stocks  or there is some more space  for downside  
just  share your  thoughts  as no one  can predicts  the right time..
520 2018-10-07 15:35:08 I knew it was bad when the expensive PPO plan dropped price wise (high deductible) and my cheaper HMO doubled. My head said “scam”.  Then healthcare stocks doubling over the next couple of years told me I was right for scepticism.
521 2018-10-07 15:33:43 類語編：「急に減る・下がる」
・plummet：「急落・暴落」の意。名詞と動詞の両方で使われ、アクセント位置同じ。Stocks have plummeted this quarter（この四半期で株価が暴落した）。
522 2018-10-07 15:33:08 #Prgscty @LouHutt  Lou Hutt said new 2018 IRS tax rules for capital gains on stocks, mutual funds, etc. NOT 401K invest-no tax on profit/capital gains up to $38K for single person-up to $77K for married filing jointly-check your stock portfolio or start one-know rules n use them
523 2018-10-07 15:32:43 what's there to buy? Most stocks are still way above their "cheap" valuations. Most are at fair now. But there is much more of a fall or time correction left for value investors to come in. Most so called whatsapp experts are now silent if you've noticed.
524 2018-10-07 15:31:46 OK, if u want to speculate against Trump & the economy, u can buy puts on market indices or individual stocks. Apple is a decent NASDAQ proxy, so this coming week I'm set .... to put $ into APPL put options
525 2018-10-07 15:30:53 Start building your portfolio.. if you dont have cash, rejig wherever you want and put every incremental money in stocks for next 1 year.. great time to be ready for the next bull run... we may see 9000 but will definitely see 14K-15K. have a big picture & long term trend in mind

530 2018-10-07 15:27:45 What was wrong with that?
531 2018-10-07 15:25:38 Real trading is boring buissness.
You spend days in front of a screen going through charts, waiting for your price to enter the trade, reviewing your past trades. If it is not like this, you are prone to fail.

540 2018-10-07 15:17:58 @vladtenev @AskRobinhood Whether it’s a faulty design or just flawed logic, Robinhood needs to correct this: If one leg is at risk or in the money, we'll close the spread OR match the option with another form of collateral (like cash or stocks) and let you exercise it.
541 2018-10-07 15:17:19 @jschultzf3 @TraderJessicaM @traderBRIT I was listening again to the PBR discussion from last week. Consider that the elections today have increased the IV of most Brazilian stocks trading in the US. After election, likely the IV will drop (last week Oct). PBR in good spot IMO.

545 2018-10-07 15:15:27 In point of fact they were "matched" as in TPFDL'ed.

The shortfalls weren't in "above the line forces" (Army force mgt phrase for combat forces) but in below the line, then called combat support/combat service support now "enablers" & strat lift, inventory stocks, RC mob, et al

563 2018-10-07 14:59:39 India does not have a bull or bear market. India is a trend following market and most of it, say 60% is speculation. Indian markets react to news and speculation. Not all stocks are all time high but sensex was, which shows speculative movements was on high peak.
564 2018-10-07 14:59:00 I been hearing about this one. I usually don’t like penny stocks ($1 Ish stock). It has a lot to prove still but u could trade it. Say amrn sells this should go up and u can get out w a nice 30-40% gain. I wouldn’t hold it LT tho. Imho
565 2018-10-07 14:56:43 Hmm I kinda had it in my head that (for small caps) higher rates meant higher borrowing costs and headwinds for profits but I’ve def seen the stats that rates rising in this range bodes well for stocks

582 2018-10-07 14:42:31 Easier to detect than to guess. Count the closes above yesterday in all the stocks you're interested in, and write down "new" activity. Every day until you're in or abort.  Odds will greatly increase.

614 2018-10-07 14:22:00 "On an annual basis stocks are up roughly 3 out of every 4 years. Go out to five years and the winning percentage jumps to almost 90 percent.

622 2018-10-07 14:12:52 Stocks plunged as Time Warner Inc. unveiled a naive car today.
623 2018-10-07 14:10:31 Markets have tremendously advanced since then. Individual stocks may but indices or basket of stocks can not correct this much now. We have far superior access to information and price discovery these days.
624 2018-10-07 14:10:30 Et felt much like a normal singletail - but I got a feeling that it has potential to hit harder. In my experience @MistressNo1 didn’t nearly use all her strength 
625 2018-10-07 14:10:11 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
626 2018-10-07 14:10:02 While, people are beginning to complain of pain in the stocks, I believe, it's time to start buying, #NIFTY is highly unlikely to breach 10,000 in this go. Get good stocks or even buy NIFTY Futures... High probability of win
627 2018-10-07 14:09:42 New stocks at OOTDFASH.
628 2018-10-07 14:05:12 Risk and "Actual Risk" have an inverse correlation.
Stocks should be bought when there is despair and majority says SELL & conversely
Sold when there is Euphoria and majority says there is no reason to SELL
629 2018-10-07 14:04:44 Pretty sure you warned about hame tomorrow and disappointing results at CPX a while back now but the thrust of my point is that I rarely see a positive note from you on many stocks. In fact surprised you bought Starcom..!
630 2018-10-07 14:03:52 Financial stocks only, and unprecedented times.
631 2018-10-07 14:02:04 S&P 500, DAX & FTSE on Their Heels as New Week Set to Begin: Next week, stock markets could be in for more selling with leading U.S. stocks getting hit end of last week; calendar is light with risk trends being a big focus.

If Enable does win her 2nd Arc, she will tie her owner's 6th Arc record with the late Marcel Boussac, aka Arc leading owner as to date.

644 2018-10-07 13:45:29 I bring home more money out of my paycheck.  Money I put back into this thriving economy.  Also the stocks and mutual funds in my retirement plan are going through the roof.  Lowest unemployment in decades.
These are very good things for the average American.

648 2018-10-07 13:41:19 OH. We are supposed to believe the Clinton News Network. They would be out of business if they didn’t have Trump to kick around.   Kennedy killed some one (not just accused), Clinton choked a young girl who was under his desk, and his wife gave away 20 % of our Uranium stocks

655 2018-10-07 13:34:24 Yeah, kudos. The extra money is coming out of those employees benefits and stocks that they were receiving. So they're better off how again?
656 2018-10-07 13:33:08 My taxes pay for this shit?, if Nissan close Sunderland this guy should be put in stocks in Sunderland city centre and pelted with rotten tomatoes
657 2018-10-07 13:31:24 That was  long time ago and prawn stocks were much more healthy (bigger and more plentiful), though prices were much lower.
658 2018-10-07 13:30:43 Bonds can’t be repriced in BTC, if USD goes to zero then all USD-denominated debt is worthless. Stocks and real estate can be repriced. But I think @bitstein literally means bagholding USD, which I do too.
659 2018-10-07 13:30:17 Does this person know this country was founded on protests? I know what she gets for saying this stuff but it is beyond me why followers of this drivel buy this. Not one of them got a dime in tax cuts and the only thing they know about stocks is YARDS.

661 2018-10-07 13:29:56 Ken, run for office on the platform of changing our Constitution. That is what you are asking for. Why should your state contribute so disproportionately to air pollution while another stocks our larders?

Stock market is spine of economy. With stocks goes up, companies expand business.

665 2018-10-07 13:29:01 As a trader, I still hold BTC, but I am holding a lot of USD at the moment. That said, when I do buy in I will buy bitcoin to hold. Altcoins are like penny stocks for me. But, good luck out there.

752 2018-10-07 11:54:09 Okay interesting opinion, I think I see it as owning the same companies through a simplified basket of these stocks. Why spend a lot on transaction costs if the same companies come in a basket without transaction costs right?
753 2018-10-07 11:53:43 Rel vision has been a below average fund over many years.

Temporary under performance even for 1 or 2 year is acceptable but there should be a genuine reason for it. e.g quantum holds cash 20% so expect to underperform.

But going wrong on many stocks for many years is not good.
754 2018-10-07 11:53:10 Great article which seems relevant for today. So, are FMCG stocks next in line for the correction? Or we just have to be more watchful?
755 2018-10-07 11:53:00 The strategy should be be gradually buy and accumulate stocks.. the buying can be accelerated / more allocation during bear phase..
756 2018-10-07 11:52:52 Ya that's why people diversify. Going all in on one stock is risky for anyone. If that's your life savings it's a bad idea. Mutual funds are good for a life's savings. You "play" with volitile single stocks.

767 2018-10-07 11:38:48 Agreed. Stocks are cheaper. But does market thinks it is cheaper too and stocks are likely go up or become penny stock. It depends upon your market. We should follow basic technical indicators like DMA above 200 and buy stocks which are going up rather than going south.

Under unfettered capitalism, German producers would capture govt, erect protectionist barriers & extract rents by raising prices of limited potato stocks. Libertarian right conflates capitalism and free markets at its peril

Thank you. :)

But better if we could all get out our cell phones,

And film that.

And post that.

913 2018-10-07 08:30:52 I'd call that investing personally. It's more of the mindset than the specific timeframe or actions. Investing is picking stocks (or coins in our case) which you believe in fundamentally. Trading is looking for anything with liquidity and volatility, regardless of what it is.

3. PRO Forex Traders with proven track records!
926 2018-10-07 08:13:11 U can cut the sir part.

As for 10X, one can ALWAYS get lucky. 10X in 10 years is 26% CAGR. In the past many stocks have given.

Rather than 10X, one should concentrate on 15% CAGR on WHOLE portfolio, which is pretty doable.

If u ADD to the better stocks in BIG falls CAGR jumps.

936 2018-10-07 08:03:46 Keep in mind while chasing the latest fads such as buying ‘hot’ stocks or sectoral funds. Very high annual returns may be followed by a year or two of high negative returns, and this can be severely damaging to the long-term compounding of wealth #SafetyFirst #stressfreeinvesting
937 2018-10-07 08:00:42 Some large-cap Tech Stocks are looking bearish on the #NASDAQ. These include $TLSA $NFLX $GOOG $FB and $BABA on any break below support developed over the past month or so. Once confirmed, these #stocks are #bearish over the next several weeks to months imo..

939 2018-10-07 07:57:58 One of the earliest things,  I learnt reading the "Intelligent Investor" by Graham is to try and find bargain stocks, that are selling for less than their Working Capital (Liquid Assets - Liabilities), and buy a bunch of them (1/n)
940 2018-10-07 07:56:21 The big bouquet of white roses and perfumed stocks I saw in Waitrose yesterday.
941 2018-10-07 07:55:27 Daniel, the wage growth in last quarter was 3.7%, and GDP hit a high of 4.2 - average for the year is projected to be about 3% - which Obama said was unattainable.  Stocks up about 2.7 $Trillion - Taxes down.  Black and Latino unemployment lowest in history, Female same. BOOM!
942 2018-10-07 07:53:12 See that @porinju Equity Intelligence portfolio, down 40%. . The Great Indian Nationalist Modi-Supporter and Value Buying Investor is in doldrums. Kachra stocks always goes to bin.
943 2018-10-07 07:48:07 Very interesting....3 gap down... then reversed....then in accumulation stage....Thanks for sharing.
944 2018-10-07 07:47:28 For the associates that don't stay long enough for them to vest, what are they losing?  The value of the VCP bonus and the stocks was absorbed (for the most part) into the wage increase, so for the vast majority of associates, they will actually be coming out ahead of the game.
945 2018-10-07 07:46:45 Thank you son, i have new meme stocks

949 2018-10-07 07:40:19 Can’t see him dropping his captain but that’d be my choice yes - although with Ayling in this form I’d play Berra at rb and Cooper and Jansson cb
950 2018-10-07 07:38:22 Couldn’t agree more. Quality stocks are now available at the price we all wanted to see and BUY.  Do not let fear overcome in good decision making

952 2018-10-07 07:37:23 @BrentfordFC Your manager seen this?
953 2018-10-07 07:37:05 All depends on your average I suppose. At 1.1p any deal should still see a profit. I think a buyer is waiting for permits then I fancy 2.25p low ball offer.

THANKS WITH REGARDS 
958 2018-10-07 07:31:26 The keeper is no different to any other player on the pitch in terms of he took absolutely none of the ball. Shot/pass, if you miss the ball and take the player, it’s a foul. If it happened at the other end, would you be screaming for a pen?
959 2018-10-07 07:29:14 I have bought couple of cryptos and some stocks plus currencies. Can I apply?
960 2018-10-07 07:28:42 Cooper had one of his Cooper days yesterday. Generally been decent this season but he’s still got that in his locker.

962 2018-10-07 07:27:35 I agree that he goes down too early, but to me it was somebody anticipating the contact. The way he went down was diagraceful, but if he was stood straight here, he would still have been brought down a split second later. Pen for me.
963 2018-10-07 07:24:41 Stronger dollar will fuse next recession. Already started in Emerging Markets, Developed Countries stock markets correction started last week, much more to follow. Dollar/Euro to parity at least. #recession #warning #stocks #dollar
964 2018-10-07 07:24:39 Depleted squad definitely not helping but the ref stopping the match every 5 seconds stopped the flow of the match. What’s happened to Ayling? Broke so many attacks yesterday with his wayward passing. Harrison not doing enough. Hernandez Berardi and Roofe back in that team 
965 2018-10-07 07:24:26 Waiting for market bottom will only end up is paying high price for stocks. Since once we are near bottom, which we will never know in any case,prices will shoot up fast.
So better SIP in quality stocks in every dip. When you invest for long term price fluctuation not matter(2/2)
966 2018-10-07 07:24:05 Only one with real facts  ..no its not my task ...I hope you won't  blame me for insider trading in OMC

969 2018-10-07 07:21:18 For once international break come at the right time I think! Get players back, others rested & let’s get firing on all cylinders. 
970 2018-10-07 07:20:46 As far as long term investing is concerned. It's right time to get stocks now. Even still prices are not that cheap. But SIP in quality bluechips and all those investments themes(consumption theme, etc) stocks will ensure good return in future. (1/2)

976 2018-10-07 07:14:26 I don't understand you people logic.. OMC stocks have feel more than 50% from its high even before the particular announcement by Government. They are in down cycle and will be in down cycle sometime. News just speeded up the rate of fall that's all. (1/2)

982 2018-10-07 07:10:50 Remember "It's all about getting to the Party Early!" And it's all about timing. I only ALERT & PICK Bottom priced Penny Stocks or Crypto that way it can only go UP! 
983 2018-10-07 07:09:23 Exactly it's all about timing. I only ALERT & PICK Bottom priced Penny Stocks or Crypto that way it can only go UP! 
984 2018-10-07 07:09:19 We have to keep their stock down. As the broker are still the same.
Try to sell their stocks at all markets.
Not leave a single market not even a red light area (दंगा फज़ाद) with the help of so call JNUs LWs.
985 2018-10-07 07:08:11 Dollarisation means $9 billion bank deposits become greenbacks and $11 billion stocks and shares become greenbacks. Where will we get all these greenbacks for just these two claims?
986 2018-10-07 07:06:26 I completely agree. After two years of DGI investing I can't say it's going poorly, but I believe more and more that the even more passive style of ETF's will be a long term winner. Just a small % of the portfolio in stocks for fun should work out fine.

996 2018-10-07 06:59:54 1875 stocks out of 150000??? This is nothing.
997 2018-10-07 06:58:52 When Markets fall then everything falls. Some people expect their stocks to do well in such turbulent times which is like expecting a spinning ball from #Ambrose. Quality falls less but retail investors don't like quality stocks.
998 2018-10-07 06:57:56 Investing in stocks are like movies

There is no magic formulas.

Even Best directors have many Flops

In a year you have 300+ bollywood movies

~70% fail loose money 
~30%  make profit
~ 10% make 10 X
~ 5% make 20 X 
~ 1% make 100X

You never know what makes 100x

999 2018-10-07 06:57:40 Good intro to short selling but was surprised no mention of put options as another way to short stocks. With puts your risk is limited to the cost of the option contract. Short selling risk is unlimited given stocks can rise to infinity but can only drop to zero.

1030 2018-10-07 06:25:59 Is there a different way to parse this data? There is a bunching of observations in 2011 and then in 2013.
In effect suggesting that once the number of stocks above 200dma falls below 20% it tends to stay that way for a while. Q is how long do such time periods last?

For a beginner

# First, stick to nifty 50 stocks

# Once u can figure out evaluation basics, check nifty next 50

# lastly, after 2-4 years, check nifty midcap 100.

That's ALL the stocks u require to track for the first 10 years or maybe your WHOLE investing career!

1154 2018-10-07 04:12:27 Stocks and commodities are real tangible things, they're backed by assets and companies with clearly defined value. 

When they're not? When they're based entirely on speculation of a future value with no regard for the actual value? You have a bubble.
1155 2018-10-07 04:12:21 Nope not wise at all.........they are backed by a USD loan facility that is less than th amount issued, so if they are demonetised who will incur th costs. Rather keep your value as M3 and M4 which is backed by fundamentals e.g stocks. Buying OM stock wil ensure a better hedge

1196 2018-10-07 03:35:53 When you screen for stocks, you need to distinguish between 1) stuff you want and 2) stuff you don’t want. For 1) you can have a strong filter, e.g. gross margin over 50%. For 2) you just want to remove the bad apples, e.g. P/E should be below 70, so you use a weak filter

1251 2018-10-07 02:31:23 one big reason for the stock market climb since 2009 was the fed policy of artificially lowering interest rates in a desperate bid to prop up the failing economy.

1264 2018-10-07 02:13:37 Now the top-3 run nose-to-tail.  You're always guaranteed an entertaining show when Brandon Clements and AJ Sanders show up in Mini-Stocks.
1265 2018-10-07 02:12:21 I'm against bump stocks. I see no logical reason to have them around. Banning magazines does not make any sense to me though. For starters, the majority of handguns and long guns are semi-auto and therefore have magazines (pretty much everything but shotguns & revolvers).
1266 2018-10-07 02:09:15 what’s wrong here is that short sellers are not just betting against stocks, in a case like TSLA they are also very active in creating armies of trolls (many are bots) to spread misinformation and influence media coverage, great product will still win though
1267 2018-10-07 02:07:22 He's also pissed off our allies. So now we are friends w/ Kim and Putin. And made laughing stocks to world leaders. Real progress there.
1268 2018-10-07 02:07:16 Should have bought her some stocks. So dumb. 
1269 2018-10-07 02:07:14 Banning magazines in NO way hurts or interferes with any person's #2a rights.  To think so is totally moronic and indicative of the NRA's refusal to back any serious proposal that would help curb gun violence.  The NRA even supports bump stocks. The NRA is no friend to America.
1270 2018-10-07 02:04:30 seems like blindly spamming shield grab/nair oos/dsmash wiff -> dsmash wiff is good enough to get a couple stocks off mang0 LOL
1271 2018-10-07 02:04:19 I’m not sure, but I thought I saw you throw some stocks while you were playing, you’re so cool and he appreciates you
1272 2018-10-07 02:03:07 Heavily out played by 2 teams that are supposed to be laughing stocks.

1274 2018-10-07 02:01:47 Bruh, my uncle talking bout don’t zip your purse up let me hold something. Me: I’m broke. Him: nah I know you be trading stocks. I be seeing you on there. Me:  Does he know I’m bout to open a Vanguard acct?? What is this guy talking about?
1275 2018-10-07 02:00:31 He is gaining relationships with foreign. Countries that we were timid with, like North Korea, other presidents wanted to, trump did it.. which boosted the economy, stocks boomed
1276 2018-10-07 02:00:20 Coat hangar manufacturer stocks are surely shooting higher, correct?
1277 2018-10-07 01:59:51 So, if I take a risk on a lottery ticket, what ever the amount, and I win, I pay no taxes on those gains. But if i take a risk on an investment, and “win” when I sell, I need to pay taxes?  Stocks, funds, property are different than a lottery ticket how? Oh BTW don’t tax lottery!
1278 2018-10-07 01:59:03 Anyone know how to trade ASX stocks from Canada?
1279 2018-10-07 01:57:28 We can lower ourselves to Trump's and the MAGAts levels. Tar and feathering was a cruel and brutal practice. Tar would burn the skin off and leave raw gaping wounds covered with feathers. No pain meds to pull them off after tar cools. Stocks humiliate. It's enough to Impeach.
1280 2018-10-07 01:55:55 Should there be a requirement for individuals to have a modest threshold of knowledge to buy single name stocks in brokerage account?
1281 2018-10-07 01:53:48 nothing can be more erroneous ,  stocks that hold out in this fall may/most likely fall in the next round,  if its a bear market,  nothing is safe
1282 2018-10-07 01:50:46 At wall stadium,  factory stocks championship goes to Mike montano. Win goes to elliot wohl. Scott Riggleman finished second in the race. Montano third

1284 2018-10-07 01:50:01 What's surprising to me during this down leg is that it seems CORRELATION has gone up a lot, with basically ALL stocks going down at the same time. (Exaggerating here to make the point.)

1288 2018-10-07 01:45:42 Stocks are manipulated. my source: ten minutes learning about how stock trading works. Not how to do it but how it all works independent of you doing anything.

Wish people would do a little bit of research before acting like its a big deal.
1289 2018-10-07 01:43:01 If it’s too good to be true, it probably is. Same is true in life and #crypto my friends. Sure, some people became overnight millionaires but far more lost it all. Same as with stocks and other investments. Be patient, don’t expect overnight riches and invest what you can lose.
1290 2018-10-07 01:41:00 @Tesla stock continues to drop, as CEO Elon Musk’s recent tweets target the SEC. Stockholders are begging him over Twitter to stop tweeting for the sake of their stocks. #SUACCF18

problem arises only in bear market in bull everything okay and anyone can fund manager
1295 2018-10-07 01:35:39 General heads up: I'm limited in tweeting about specific stocks. Open DM. I cover Equities and the 
1296 2018-10-07 01:35:38 Okay, but I have bills to pay.. saving 50% isn't realistic.  I'm doing what I can to set myself up for financial independence, including investing in crypto and stocks, thanks for the non-financial advice.

Have a great weekend
1297 2018-10-07 01:34:57 That's called a trend. Higher stocks does not a good president make.

1301 2018-10-07 01:29:02 Last year was good, this year not yet, so suggest not banging the drum so often. Yes, economy is good, however vast majority of stocks, funds, IRAs are weak this year if not down, 3Q running, despite great earnings and forecasts. Why?, Answers? No fund investing, agendas, Fed, ..
1302 2018-10-07 01:27:23 I’m not waiting until Nov.

1304 2018-10-07 01:26:36 Managed to sneak in a 3 stock 1v1 in with Snake and Sheik earlier tonight. 3 Stocks feels so natural to the game. I am so ready for December to come so I can deep dive into this game in 2 months.
1305 2018-10-07 01:25:30 Oh its definatly sic when the pillsrs of society are trump and trump jr! Fn laughing stocks!
1306 2018-10-07 01:25:05 Pardon my misspellings. Texting and driving using Siri. Apple sucks and should not be $230 a share 1.15. Market cap overvalued just like the rest of the fraud stocks out there

1308 2018-10-07 01:21:28 Sorry Tater POOF. Once again U don't know your facts because Fox dosen't educate y'all.  If U knew your facts, you'd know Beto owns guns, has never said he wants 2 take them away from U, just wants stricter laws, no bump stocks, age 21, stricter Mental health checks.  #Education

1310 2018-10-07 01:19:05 Ohh you get to play w stocks that awesome
1311 2018-10-07 01:17:38 This is like saying that GM and Apple are the same because they are stocks.

(Query for my dear followers: which logical fallacy is this?)
1312 2018-10-07 01:15:58 I’ve personally invested in stocks and forex and almost in a life insurance policy this year. 

So I know what I’m preaching.
1313 2018-10-07 01:13:33 There are different types of market corrections. 

# close the FDs & liquid investments & buy stocks 

# sell the car & buy stocks 

# sell the house & buy stocks 

This is just the 1st variety. 

2nd one is some distance away. 

3rd one is "once in a lifetime" kind of thing.
1314 2018-10-07 01:10:41 Our grand kids and great grand kids will be astounded that we sold their future for higher stocks today. Let’s see how are our staple crops supposed to thrive when average mean temp is 2c higher. Economic collapse in places like Florida because of sea level rise will affect all

1325 2018-10-07 00:59:52 I’ve probably done 80s theme a lot and trying new themes and ideas, I’m trying to use less stocks and do more on personal skill but I have done a few in my design without them. I’m also trying my hardest to avoid ideas or techniques from other designers
1326 2018-10-07 00:59:23 He's pretty much not pro- any of the things you said he was.

Please turn in your bump stocks now. We'll have due process later.

And here's a long time Beltway swamp insider George W appointed for your next Justice! RIP Fourth Amendment.
1327 2018-10-07 00:57:42 That’s called market.. it won’t behave as per your expectation ... try to own individual stocks not market
1328 2018-10-07 00:56:32 Agreed, so bad for democrats. Record employment, record stocks, better trade, record judges, America kicking ass.  #MAGA
1329 2018-10-07 00:56:04 Associated Press’s Christopher Rugaber notes, “Stock market wealth has been flowing disproportionately — and increasingly — to the most affluent households. The richest one-tenth of Americans own about 84 percent of the value of stocks.”
1330 2018-10-07 00:55:21 Pulling my money out of stocks on Tuesday.  Not giving trump that win with my retirement savings.   Many are joining.  If we get enough they will be talking about how #KavanaughVote sank the #StockMarket.
1331 2018-10-07 00:54:15 Taking dubs off and putting the stocks back on for the winter always makes me a little bit sad. 

Summer 18 is outta here.
1332 2018-10-07 00:54:02 84% of all stocks owned by Americans belong to the wealthiest 10% of households.   

“For the vast majority of Americans, fluctuations in the stock market have relatively little effect on their wealth, or well-being, for that matter,” said Edward N. Wolff, an economist at NYU.
1333 2018-10-07 00:53:14 Well your contract obviously doesn’t preclude you from owning stocks via trusts.
1334 2018-10-07 00:52:27 What is this? Pro wrestling? Dear lord, y’all are pathetic. You have no platform, you only have anti-Trump rhetoric... Economy is up. Unemployment down. Stocks up. ISIS is down. Wages are up. Crime is down. Now go away!!!
1335 2018-10-07 00:51:50 I'd like to thank the FGC for being the sole, direct cause of Nissin's raising stocks

1338 2018-10-07 00:50:12 Screw November.  Let’s take em down on Tuesday.   I’m taking all my funds from stocks and moving to bonds.  Enough of us do that and the Trump market miracle is over. 

#stocks have hit their high for the year anyway.
1339 2018-10-07 00:47:12 Siempre interesante el maestro Bogle, una de sus perlas en el artículo: Mr. Bogle says he has roughly half of his money in stocks, half in bonds. “I spend about half of my time wondering why I have so much in stocks,” he says, “and about half wondering why I have so little.”
1340 2018-10-07 00:46:59 If we want to make money available to entrepreneurs, we must support actions that get money to entrepreneurs. Trading existing stocks gives nothing to entrepreneurs.  It's just gambling - playing financial games.  It creates no productive capital. It doesn't support production.
1341 2018-10-07 00:45:36 Y’all go check out this app called “Robinhood” ! Free app to trade/buy stocks 
1342 2018-10-07 00:44:48 you can get list of stocks we're watching as well as alerts with exact plan inside chat room
1343 2018-10-07 00:44:15 Ouch, sorry!  But true, it's noise.  Discount the 2% inflation from the rates or 10year yields ... and we are very far from a high yield "trouble for stocks" situation.

1350 2018-10-07 00:39:42 So you believe banning Adjustible stocks is not an infringement.

I disagree.

Could shoot, does not equal fits. Having an appropriate pull length and cheek weld. And how about Democrat politicians focusing on something that matters.

Perhaps disarming their security details?
1351 2018-10-07 00:39:12 Lol only because I really want this dress and she only stocks a few. Once it’s gone it’s gone and this dress is too cute to pass up. I’ve tried googling it and everything nothing
1352 2018-10-07 00:36:57 Nothing gets spared when the market falls like this. Reliance lost 16% last week. Even the stocks that did quite well holding up in September collapsed last week.

1358 2018-10-07 00:23:48 I’m not ‘in finance’ per se, but have invested my savings & that of my family,  for 20+ years (primarily in individual stocks), to the tune of ~4% better than he s&p (annualized). This includes having invested through the 2001 dotcom crash, as well as the 08/09 financial crisis..
1359 2018-10-07 00:22:16 Trump is marking "taxes" a pox on Democrats. The only people who agree with Pelosi & Ocasio-Cortez on raising taxes are those who pay none or have way too much.
Lower taxes, lower unemployment, higher stocks & Kavanaugh.
Stick a fork in Dems, they're done.

1375 2018-10-06 23:56:07 Wait until November?  I don’t think so.  I am taking action this Tues.

I’m pulling all my funds from stocks and moving them to bonds. 

Trump’s team crows about their success with the market.  I’m not participating anymore.

1378 2018-10-06 23:54:00 Just occurred to me, have the feed of the stocks and percentage of each player replicated underneath their tag/ player cam. I'd 100% try that at a tournament if I ever streamed one again.
1379 2018-10-06 23:53:08 I use Finviz as well. 
I scan for stocks up on above average volume. 
I go through all the charts. Then, for the very few I find of interest, I check the reason for the move and the fundies.
Technicals first, then fundamentals.
1380 2018-10-06 23:52:30 Not just prison but put him in stocks on Times Square, have him dressed as a clown and let folks throw rotting vegetables at him and laugh at him for several hours a day before being returned to his cell.

1390 2018-10-06 23:46:09 Roger arguing incessantly on intrinsic value is a joke, clearly Charlie is using the term in reference to financial markets, in this context it’s a fact that stocks, currency etc have intrinsic value.

Trump’s team crows about their success with the market.  I’m not participating anymore.

#stocks have reached their high for the year anyway.
1394 2018-10-06 23:55:18 Finally learning to trade stocks so i can get shmoney like the white folk
1395 2018-10-06 23:54:37 I'm pretty sure Amazon stock flux capacitors. Although, what's funnier is my predictive text stocks 'flux capacitor'
1396 2018-10-06 23:54:00 Just occurred to me, have the feed of the stocks and percentage of each player replicated underneath their tag/ player cam. I'd 100% try that at a tournament if I ever streamed one again.
1397 2018-10-06 23:53:08 I use Finviz as well. 
I scan for stocks up on above average volume. 
I go through all the charts. Then, for the very few I find of interest, I check the reason for the move and the fundies.
Technicals first, then fundamentals.
1398 2018-10-06 23:52:30 Not just prison but put him in stocks on Times Square, have him dressed as a clown and let folks throw rotting vegetables at him and laugh at him for several hours a day before being returned to his cell.
1399 2018-10-06 23:51:11 Tuesday is a day of reckoning.  Money is coming out of #stocks and going into bonds.   Trump thinks he won?  It’s our right to put our money where we think it will do the best.

1404 2018-10-06 23:48:47 @ericbolling You were cool when just had that stocks show.  No you are an asshat.
1405 2018-10-06 23:48:34 October 6 has been formally proclaimed “Have a cold beer for Liberty Day!”

1406 2018-10-06 23:47:44 Yuh! I'm movin' and just gave mine to a couple'a friends. It's made cooking meals for a week a breeze. Can make all-day chilli in an hour, make really wonderful soup stocks and roasts. AND cheesecake. And yogurt. .... And rice. and beans. And it's great.
1407 2018-10-06 23:46:42 Of course he is wasted - WWE doesn't care about wrestling, they care about looks and stocks and nothing else  I mean like at Kevin Owens title run, he is a fantastic wrestler top to bottom but because he was not "What WWE wants" they made his run meaningless.
1408 2018-10-06 23:46:09 Roger arguing incessantly on intrinsic value is a joke, clearly Charlie is using the term in reference to financial markets, in this context it’s a fact that stocks, currency etc have intrinsic value.
1409 2018-10-06 23:45:45 I’m not waiting until #NovemberIsComing.  I’m taking action this coming Tuesday.  I am taking all my funds from 401k & moving them from stocks to bonds. 

I’m not contributing to that Trump win.

Market has reached its high for the year anyway.

#stocks about to take a tumble.
1410 2018-10-06 23:44:06 What about other professions such as IT, Software engineering? Parents spend so much educating daughters. Girls have so many dreams when they join the workforce. Then reality strikes in the form of  wolves. Women loose confidence, opportunities, promotions, raises, bonuses stocks
1411 2018-10-06 23:44:01 So what would you like to debate on?   Let me guess ...your stocks are doing great so the President is great?
1412 2018-10-06 23:42:46 Lmfao put the stocks back on!
1413 2018-10-06 23:41:59 Do some research and look a the stock price compared to other top ten stocks and the multiples it’s priced at
1414 2018-10-06 23:41:32 A friend of mine peeped my snapchat and saw some baggetry. Young bull came out saying, “Are you trading stocks bro?”

I said, “Listen here lil bih, this is Crypto. Where we don’t buy unless the dip low.” 

Took him a bit but he finally copped some $BTC and some $LTC
1415 2018-10-06 23:40:50 Darn I should have bought stocks in beer.

1417 2018-10-06 23:39:06 Better idea.  You want to make a statement?  

Pull your 401k funds out of stocks on Tuesday.   Put funds into bonds.  Hit the Rs where they live.  -,Wall Street.
1418 2018-10-06 23:38:25 As you should. But remember stocks are priced off future expectations.
1419 2018-10-06 23:38:00 Out of 500... but yeah he sucks.  try not to enjoy the booming economy, stocks and low unemployment
1420 2018-10-06 23:35:07 Put him in stocks so we can throw rotten tomatoes at him!

1422 2018-10-06 23:29:14 I tend to differ WendO, I think there is still major room for paperless Whitepaper projects to flourish again, FOMO is an additive drug and you can see how it went from crypto to now marijuana stocks. Manipulation is such a strong vehicle to drive profits that folks are waiting

On Tuesday all of my funds are coming out of stocks & going into bonds.  The stock market is Trump’s most shiny accomplishment.  It benefits the wealthiest people in our country but not most of us. You want to ensure the Rs lose in Nov?  Pull funds out of stocks

1427 2018-10-06 23:21:20 Just a reminder to everyone.

1429 2018-10-06 23:19:38 Stocks look heavy, as long as governments keep printing it will rise. Humans can’t even reach the moon so don’t count on Mars 
1430 2018-10-06 23:19:33 Hard to say man. The only speculation we all seem to agree on is: it will come. But is it when stocks collapse / a new crisis emerges and people hedge via crypto? When institutional investors get in true Bakkt oid?# ETF's? Something totally different? So much we dunno rn..
1431 2018-10-06 23:19:12 Hi Mike where can I find the ETF,INDEX for related stocks, example AMZN, AAPL, NFLX etc. please advice me.

1435 2018-10-06 23:13:44 apple stocks rise by 35%.
1436 2018-10-06 23:13:43 Curious to know why you compared $tsla to $jcp and $shld, two stocks that are essentially call options on a freakin’ miracle. Is the irony lost on you?
1437 2018-10-06 23:12:54 It's easy to make money in the market, it's harder to keep it. Managing risk and respecting stops (max daily loss) is the only way to stay alive in this game. All it takes is one day, one wrong trade and lack of discipline to go bankrupt.

1441 2018-10-06 23:06:49 As for the SEC thing: If he'd been trying to manipulate stocks, the 'going private' tweet isn't how anyone would do it. 

He may be offended that his integrity was questioned. Sometimes one's pride makes one a little reckless.

1443 2018-10-06 23:05:40 "Common sense gun laws" is Democrat for nonsensical & ineffective infringements.

For example: Adjustible stocks are considered an evil feature in CA .

Banning Adjustible stocks to reduce shootings is like banning Adjustible seats in cars to prevent drunk driving deaths.

1455 2018-10-06 22:50:41 "Stocks are the release valve as the bond market cracks" 

IMO this statement is true, but indicative of the recent past not future. In times of risk-on, few want to hold cash. But in times of risk-off, "lowly old cash becomes a desirable asset, not an inferior one." -@hussmanjp
1456 2018-10-06 22:48:22 Like the new EO banning bump stocks?
1457 2018-10-06 22:46:18 It’s all about currency IMO. That’s the leading indicator of capital flows. The DOW breaking out in every major trading currency is very suggestive that equities can really run from here as a monetary crisis cycle plays out. Stocks are the release valve as the bond market cracks

1525 2018-10-06 21:28:05 @POTUS DEMS, if Trump wins the country will fall apart!! Lowest unemployment, lowest for blacks, Hispanic and women, stocks soaring, jobs high, countries not taking advantage. Kavanaugh a justice DEMS, no more abortions, etc. they are hysterical. They have lost it
1526 2018-10-06 21:25:22 My little brother over here buying stocks and making investments while I’m over here trying to figure out where I’m gonna watch the fight lmao you go BOY!
1527 2018-10-06 21:21:14 No, it doesn't. A savvy and seasoned investor would share  the risk in stocks, mutual funds, bonds and cash. Stocks are the  most dangerous investing media just after options and futures. I really hope you don't advise people about their hard earned savings...
1528 2018-10-06 21:20:58 @Caitlin_Stocks - “shall we go downstairs and watch man of the match” ...

1530 2018-10-06 21:19:51 Chinese tech stocks Lenovo Group and ZTE Corp. tumbled in Hong Kong following a news report Chinese spies might have used chips supplied by another company to hack into U.S. computer systems. Lenovo shares closed down 15.1 percent while ZTE lost 11 percent.
1531 2018-10-06 21:16:44  Too early to go out... Next time have stocks yo
1532 2018-10-06 21:15:11 Not true. I admit to having several very conservative friends. We don’t discuss politics any more because I’m tired of talking facts while they say my stocks are up! What human price are you willing to pay for a stock portfolio?!?
1533 2018-10-06 21:15:11 Still pumps money into the economy, right? Not so much. Because the higher-income someone is, the lower the percentage of their income they spend on stuff that actually boosts the economy. Instead, a lot of the extra goes into savings, stocks, & bonds, spending that will /4
1534 2018-10-06 21:14:29 And JP Morgan & Goldman Sachs have terrible predictions for  US stocks and the economy in 2019.

1542 2018-10-06 21:07:20 Imagine how much more productive society would be if in high school we were taught how to run a business, do taxes/payroll, invest in stocks & mutual funds, buy/maintain real estate, etc. Instead they continue to teach math formulas that 98% of us will NEVER use. #EducationReform
1543 2018-10-06 21:07:02 LOL
1544 2018-10-06 21:05:10 Great for the stocks!!
1545 2018-10-06 21:04:23 Yet, 54 million Americans, or 40% of all full time workers, have 401(k) savings plans and 79% of employees have access to employer-assisted 401(k) plans. The median retirement account is $63K and for those over 50 it's well over $100K. Most of that retirement money is in stocks.
1546 2018-10-06 21:03:50 Il suffit de regarder les stocks mondiaux et leur évolution pour se rendre compte que ce n est pas possible. Et des années "normale " on en a plus guère en période de réchauffement climatique

1561 2018-10-06 20:49:38 Stocks have risen in nine of the first ten months of the Trump Administration, a record that no other U.S. president can match.

That goes back to President William McKinley in 1897; before 1896 there were no stock indices
1562 2018-10-06 20:48:44 TIL my dog likes me approximately 14% more when I'm holding a rice krispie treat. Now would be a good time to invest in stocks of Kellogg.

1575 2018-10-06 20:39:17 Most don't. I convinced one of my hs buddies to start saving for retirement at 19. I started at 18. I've been only buying index funds when I should have been throwing all my money in Visa and other blue chip stocks.
1576 2018-10-06 20:39:15 the series of ‘drank so much I felt like I was gonna die’.. woke up at 4pm from puking my guts out all morning but Alex stocks the fridge with edibles, Gatorade, pie, candy, cookies, and even electrolytes. ALL while having a breakfast waiting for me and a coffee
1577 2018-10-06 20:38:53 With the recent confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the high court, I am putting a “buy” recommendation on all  coat hanger manufacturer stocks.

1580 2018-10-06 20:34:08 Stock newsletter - do y’all use one? via /r/Stock_Picks

Curious if y’all use a newsletter or some place for advice about which stocks to purchase/sell/etc?

I’m fairly new to trading, doing my due diligence, but have no idea where to begin. (I’m sure this is a common trend/…
1581 2018-10-06 20:31:27 Most of my money for crypto came from my investments in Canadian weed stocks. Got in early with Aurora and Canopy. Still have long positions in & recommend OGI, FFT, XLY (TSX)

1585 2018-10-06 20:29:08 Designed a semi-auto rifle in the '20s chambered in a revolutionary .276 cartridge, but lost out to Garand's (better) design. Army planned on chambering the Garand in .276, but MacArthur vetoed it due to the massive leftover stocks of .30-06 from WWI
1586 2018-10-06 20:29:06 Very few Christians can understand what Joy this brings. But to us who follow such moments, it a win for us. God is showing us something. Truly end times signal. US shall yarn to have @realDonaldTrump. Unemployment at an all time low, stocks booming while Chinese are struggling.
1587 2018-10-06 20:28:05 Bump stocks are still legal in nearly every state and y’all still expected the Senate to do the right thing with Kavanaugh?

I know you say to wait till  Thursday for more data numbers to come in but it is more than 10% off high
1597 2018-10-06 20:20:54 Wonder if beer stocks will go up?

1619 2018-10-06 20:05:43 @CNBCnow @CNBC Congrats to Brett Kavanaugh! Now let’s get back to buying stocks!! @FoxBusiness
1620 2018-10-06 20:05:35 Stocks soaring. Unemployment plummeting. The Korea’s are BFFs, Scalia seat filled, Kennedy replaced.

Maybe Trump was worth it. 

Still have to defund Planned Parenthood, though.
1621 2018-10-06 20:02:56 You're right, it's also a bit of a hobby to pick stocks and to update my finance sheets... I'm currently working on a sheet to work out how my portfolio would look. Might have to add some space for miscellaneous dividend stocks after all!
1622 2018-10-06 20:02:30 El desequilibrio viene cuando nos tiramos todo el día haciendo pequeñas y repetitivas acciones, como teclear, controlar los stocks en las tiendas de alimentación, hacer hamburguesas o mover el ratón de un ordenador

1630 2018-10-06 19:54:54 I still believe that $BTC is negatively correlated to the actual stockmarkets.

It’s created at the last crisis in response to the bankers.

Gold has the same purpose.

Given the fact that stocks are ridiculously high, I can’t see anything else then up for crypto & commodities.

1637 2018-10-06 19:48:46 I noticed a few #CBD shops have popped up in my town, I think the sector is really about to take off, capitalize on it by investing into great stocks like $NBEV and $HIPH #ToTheMoon #BetterYourself #BTC #XRP #WorkSmarterNotHarder
1638 2018-10-06 19:46:16 If it were stocks only, I would agree. My point is MFE/MAE is not calculated on options and 95% of these stats are for options trades. You can argue your point all day if you like but it won’t change the fact that they are irrelevant in options trading

1722 2018-10-06 18:10:58 It's not really a circle - all happens continuously, nothing happens "first". Imagine a 24-hour produce market with people constantly buying and lorryloads of produce constantly arriving. If stocks get low you order more.  The Treasury is like that with money, not produce.

1726 2018-10-06 18:05:37 If stocks are tanking why would you not liquidate your portfolio and buy bitcoin? that is the thought. At least I would. Yeah the price would fall because maybe less will be invested monthly but I expect more people to move assets into crypto during a recession
1727 2018-10-06 18:05:22 @DeplorableMan21 he's saying he is buying more on Monday!  $mlhc been a long time since I've seen everyone so stoked for a company! @DB_Stocks glad to have you on board !
1728 2018-10-06 18:05:21 Have you looked at other tobacco stocks ? The bigs, Phillip Morris and BTI, have returned 0% since 2012. $PYX is a pivot play. Of course, no guarantee it'll work but punishing its former biz model doesn't help me look forward, IMO.
1729 2018-10-06 18:05:17 1) institutional investors think the bottom for crypto and the tops for stocks & the dollar are in
2) executives are offloading more & more personal shares
3) JP Morgan is stockpiling the largest collection of silver in history

US economy’s in great shape though! 
1730 2018-10-06 18:03:44 The thought is that people will switch from stocks and ETFs to load up on crypto. Yes it will go down but the users growth I think will happen faster during a recession.

1737 2018-10-06 17:59:59 Actually due to atmospheric pressure the air inside expands which causes the material of the ballon to stretch until it eventually tears/pops. Forces of nature apply to stocks just as well. When everyone least expects it the bagholders will be a many.

1755 2018-10-06 17:43:12 ETF track bond indices and bond indices typically keep average maturity/duration constant. I think it makes sense as investors want to target given duration. Also, being traded as stocks, I don’t think you can have ETF with penalties for selling shares early.

1766 2018-10-06 17:36:01 We need all investors to tell their Brokers not to make any of their stock lendable. It also makes their dividends on other stocks taxed as ordinary income instead as a long-term capital gain which is twice as high, ruffly. if their stock is lent out.  Fyi.

1782 2018-10-06 17:21:36 You're right. Is that a law of nature or is there anything that might change that? Do you think a few 'f' stocks uplisting to the NYSE & Nasdaq when there's consistent press about Canadian legalization might change that?
1783 2018-10-06 17:21:08 Just like when the world would implode and the stocks would crash and we would be back in the dark ages if Trump won the election.  Spreading false information just like you're blaming Russia of doing.

Las las a Manager is hired to do the job not the players... he is leaving I trust UTD cos stocks are dropping
1787 2018-10-06 17:19:08 I just need stocks that aren't tech to invest in, I don't know any other industry - _-
1788 2018-10-06 17:18:48 I think I'm gonna buy ear plug stocks.
1789 2018-10-06 17:17:29 I could pull the trigger faster then using bump stocks
1790 2018-10-06 17:16:18 Bleeter stocks are rising. Invest in bleeter stocks on bawsaq before it’s too late!
1791 2018-10-06 17:16:02 Maturity is when you think of life insurance, educational plan for your child, stocks, savings. In short bills 
1792 2018-10-06 17:14:24 Cash isn't a weighting for me or reflection of mkt view. I invest in individual stocks, each on their own merit. Each has pre-determined stop where trend is invalidated for my timeframe. When I get an exit signal it generates cash. When no new entry signals it gets left as cash.

1795 2018-10-06 17:13:34 I tried couple if ways-

1. You can make your own ratio and formula in screener. 

2. Go sector wise. I use stockedge to identify stocks in the sector. And then key in data in Excel sheet. You may cherry pick companies and then try on it as well.
1796 2018-10-06 17:11:58 Sold all Brazilian stocks out of portfolio, just in case.
1797 2018-10-06 17:11:56 A big influence for me...was seeing a chart some months back, that the Nasdaq market and related stocks...was as or more expensive to value stocks of all kinds...since the market top in March 2000.  Why chase, then? 
Why not look for great companies in the ignored value areas?
1798 2018-10-06 17:11:48 Never compare crypto to stocks. There’s a lot of things you’ll see in crypto that’s not common in stocks. Like XRP going from $0.006 to $3 in 2017.

1801 2018-10-06 17:08:10 At some point emerging markets will widely be a buy.  I already have exposure through certain EM stocks and some Canadian.  All commodity related. 
Rarely has the spread between EM and US markets been this extreme, same as massive spread between value and concept / tech stocks.
1802 2018-10-06 17:06:21 Are you saying there's no racists in MA, or that their magical electorate-domination powers don't work there? Maybe it means that MA was sold ACA, and not access to Congress' health plan with no mandate, then bait-and-switched for legislation that sent pharma stocks into space?

1812 2018-10-06 17:01:12 No body knows after six months market will be at below 9000 or above 12000
so what to do now, Stay invested in stocks / mfs 35% of your total capital, 
deploy 5% of your total capital on every 5% correction in market, Exit 5% on every rise of 5% in market
1813 2018-10-06 17:00:50 Too many see #Bitcoin only as a price. They Trade Bitcoin the way they trade stocks, and for the same reasons. They think it has no worth. That comes from the realization that our money is constantly approaching Zero, so too in their mind is everything else.

1815 2018-10-06 16:58:52 Personally I use $TRIN 10-dma to help see if stocks are in an oversold (above 1.20 on the chart) or overbought (under 0.80) condition. Tho I’ve also noticed a divergent higher low, or lower high, can mark a serious move coming. Fast swings might also use the shorter-term MA’s.

As a self-dependent woman, I'd love to see one and share my learning!
1819 2018-10-06 16:54:25 Yeah well “he” praised Bezos before it came out that Amazon was taking the stocks away.  Let’s not spit on the one politician who is actually fighting for working people and unions.

1821 2018-10-06 16:53:07 Don't show ur wisdom against this market carnage if u r not HNI or a BIG player. 
Reiterating again there is no rush to catch the bottom. Many stocks would b available at 60%, 70%, 85-90% from their peak price.
Only conviction you need is, will it be good for Long-term 10-20 yrs
1822 2018-10-06 16:53:06 Looks like they will be selling more stocks for Christmas! What a joke

1840 2018-10-06 16:41:05 BTC and Stocks most likely have a correlation coefficient that is positive but small. So stocks crash would mean a lesser decrease for BTC. BTC has properties that make the correlation coefficient less than that of stocks to bonds

2. Exercise strict discipline with cutting losing positions

1862 2018-10-06 16:26:38 Good question - what I've seen is that the microplastics are also a source of plankton death on their own. The filtration with screens may allow some plankton to get out, but likely also results in plankton death. Filtration does "net-good," but stocks will need replenishing.

1905 2018-10-06 15:47:47 Hey @RealJamesWoods did you invest any funds in beer stocks last week?
1906 2018-10-06 15:47:41 Uh, no, not even when 2 "nearly simultaneous Major Regional Conflicts" was official National Military Strategy in Clinton Admin.  

Enabler shortfalls, strat lift, PGM stocks inadequate, et al ….

Of course, POTUS undermining US spt for alliances sure helps, huh?
1907 2018-10-06 15:47:32 @1shankarsharma Sir saw your Interview with @_prashantnair on YouTube...u r the 1st person ihav heard who's calling this fall as a Bear Phase...can u spell out some stocks in your view which are down but your belief in them is intact...
1908 2018-10-06 15:46:59 Lee and I are face painting today, but only have had two customers. He then says this. “The face painting business just ain’t how it use to be, I say we sell all of our stocks. Hit the road and run.”
1909 2018-10-06 15:42:57 Trade your own stocks you shouldn't care what other people do.
1910 2018-10-06 15:42:54 I have no idea or interest either way tbh. Im from US so CSE stocks not typically my thing either. I see most CSE names (*with non US operations*) as "future dead baby seals"...to borrow a term from Wolf of Weed St
1911 2018-10-06 15:42:49 Also because I like options trading more than holding stocks.

If I had one piece of advice for any newer investor, it would be to study the effects of government policy in depth, how fiscal , international and monetary policy, affect markets, sectors and individual stocks, as a key part of your learning journey.
1913 2018-10-06 15:40:09 OMG! It gets funnier each time you watch!! While I don't like beer, my husband does, and I hope beer stocks soar thanks to Kavanaugh!

1916 2018-10-06 15:37:58 Which she might or might not have known about if it was an insider trading type deal where the buyer used govt to up his stocks selling to the higher bid, I say I would look higher than just the owner of the company

1919 2018-10-06 15:37:12 Most people with any common sense realize that. Wages decreased 2.8% in past year, adjusted for inflation consumer goods prices highest since 2008. Stocks will soon react as effects of tariffs kick in next year.

1922 2018-10-06 15:35:49 It’s really more of a way of securing your money. Everyone who buys knows it, I’m sure, but if they didn’t play the game it wouldn’t work. Basically your stocks can crash, but once a worthy gallery has decided a painting is valuable, it will always retain its value to be sold.
1923 2018-10-06 15:34:55 People freaking out about this 'crash' but my stocks are still higher than they were months ago lol.
1924 2018-10-06 15:34:17 @CNN TO ALL AMERICANS WE MUST STAY TOGETHER IN THIS NIDTERM AND IN THE TRADE WAR AGAINST CHINA YOU MUST BUY USA STOCKS CHECK YOUR 401K MAKE SURE YOU DON'T HAVE ANY INTERNATIONAL FUNDS WE MUST BRING CHINA TO A FAIR TRADE DEAL BUY USA STOCKS AND BUY AMAZON THEY ARE WAY UNDER PRICED
1925 2018-10-06 15:30:16 Noticed something very interesting: pumpers on hire .. that go out there promoting stocks ... apparently block short sellers so that they will not see the promotion on twitter. Funny MULTIPLE pumpers blocked me even if we never interacted nor I addressed any of their companies

1927 2018-10-06 15:29:39 The monthly bonus and stocks are only benefits lost. Health insurance ok. After two years or so working the deficit in total compensation will become noticable. Before that it's a decent raise. (I work in an Amazon warehouse)

1938 2018-10-06 15:22:23 At times like this my main focus is on the bond market with the goal to lock in attractive rates. I did this in 2008. I am not alone as money leaves equities for bonds the real damage occurs to stocks. Remember bottoms r like porn u know it when u see it.
1939 2018-10-06 15:21:01 That's why there's a call to ban bump stocks as well(which I can agree with)

1952 2018-10-06 15:13:07 I'm thinking at some point bonds will reverse as longer term bonds mature. That's where you would get a real bear market in stocks. At least in my opinion.

1956 2018-10-06 15:10:30 those in cash should also have the guts to buy. from my experience in the last two bear markets, it is difficult as the investor waits for a bigger fall. I got a good exit in December 2007, but could re-enter only in 2010 or thereabouts when many stocks were 10 X from the lows.

2007 2018-10-06 14:36:07 Stocks are difficult to predict as not just technical aspects influence the price.  Unfortunately, the CEO is adding another variable to Tesla's lack of predicability.  Also agree with your comments on the role of 'shorts'

2012 2018-10-06 14:31:02 Jesse, how much do you charge for your service? Meanwhile if I bot $amzn last year and sell it on Monday, I'll have an 80% return. Conversely if I bot your bang stocks last year, I'd be down 50%. No doubt fang may sell off, but if you only buy up trends and take losses quickly
2013 2018-10-06 14:30:57 $study. the upside to heavy selling is that by being in cash you can easily put on 20% or more in a few weeks after stocks are ready to advance again.  Look at how profitable March and May were. Hold cash and maintain an equity base.

2016 2018-10-06 14:28:47 How do you know that all the stocks were actually purchased and not just shown in the bills.  Who is actually corrupt is can be seen by the quality of food they provide. Contractor give substandard food coz people in govt takes money from them to give contract.  Same here
2017 2018-10-06 14:27:59 $study. quick overview of watchlists... nothing is ready for long side. Why try to find isolated stocks?  watch institutional must owns. $amzn $amd $goog. etc..  leaders will likely under cut base.  they're ready to try long when can hold  a gap on right side of base.
2018 2018-10-06 14:27:50 BS. Your graph is incorrect. The Dow was not over 20K when Obama left office. Stop being a disingenuous hairball. Do you know what people invest in when interest rates are basically 0% like they were under Obama? Stocks. Duh.

2029 2018-10-06 14:21:04 They are bored with being sidelined I would gag the lot tie them up in stocks and let the general public decide what they want to throw 
2030 2018-10-06 14:20:28 And the risk of a crash, or more likely, a correction, is the reason why stocks can be expected to return more over time.  You need to be able to gut out the bad times to reap the rewards.

2032 2018-10-06 14:19:37 I’ll bet the DG across the street, stocks up on off for the home games!! Shelves were empty last night!
2033 2018-10-06 14:19:12 At least we still assured of stocks...
2034 2018-10-06 14:18:55 My first years trading stocks were amazing in every way, but switching from FA to TA and international markets was not easy. Lots of things to learn on my own - mentors nowhere to be found. Plenty of ppl doing this wrong way and so on... Grinding. End of story 
2035 2018-10-06 14:18:54 If u got that sector ....... So many stocks available at cheep prices.....
2036 2018-10-06 14:18:53 Wow! Its Maha sell is going on 
2037 2018-10-06 14:18:13 1/In 2003, I was asked by a large pension plan to consult on what expected rate of return they should assume over the next 20 years. My study ended up becoming my 4th book but the ERR for stocks I gave them was very low (because of reversion to the mean)
2038 2018-10-06 14:17:38 Great for the corporations who are buying back their stocks. But terrible for our children who will bear $1.5 trillion in new debt. Real wages are falling and healthcare costs are going through the roof.

2042 2018-10-06 14:16:44 Anybody know US stocks
2043 2018-10-06 14:16:01 I don’t think bump stocks were part of the original debate. A whole lot of things can endanger a persons life and aren’t necessary (baseball bats, knives, swords, bow and arrows, cars). The CDC supports that defensive use of firearms far outnumber offensive uses.

2045 2018-10-06 14:15:15 The Corps took the tax refund bought there stocks back that’s what drove the stock market so high a monkey or a thief don’t know which on to thank also he gave a huge tax break to the rich for child care more than the poor or middle class .

2049 2018-10-06 14:11:08 95% loose money, shorting in panic or selling good quality stocks in delivery all of a sudden without logic. Next week same traders buy the same stocks which they sold at much higher pricers or use short covering. My broking dealer told me 90% of trader accounts are in Negative B
2050 2018-10-06 14:11:05 It's never a bad time to buy stocks.

2052 2018-10-06 14:07:10 The fascistic, homophobic Bud Lite commercials are my pet peeve. Dissent and individualism (expressed by effeminate men) punished with the Pit of Misery or time in the stocks. Pretty ugly, autocratic sentiment, but a perfect fit for Ingraham and Fox News.
2053 2018-10-06 14:06:15 Lot of people are agitated and cursing now. It happens in every correction/bearish phase. 

If people make money, it is “their” luck. If they lose, it is because of the advisor. Stocks are a ruthless game.

2080 2018-10-06 13:45:18 I'm expecting a reasonable BTC shakeout pretty soon, not buying anything. May be wrong, but that's my opinion, I prefer to stay safe and eventually - invest in some other kind of asset, not FX, just private stocks.

2088 2018-10-06 13:39:33 Provably some debt exposure out there but unlikely to be anywhere near the scale of 10 years ago. USA Stocks pretty frothy though so any little debt issue that emerges could be an excuse for a sharpish fall that is probably needed for traders anyway.

2119 2018-10-06 13:06:43 The Truth is 99% of traders can't see a correction or crash coming because they are looking at false representations of the Market. $SPY $SPX $QQQ $DJI $DIA are distorted versions of the True Market and are  easily manipulated by a handful of stocks by artificial weightings.
2120 2018-10-06 13:04:44 Yeah I think after I run my bag up I’ll retire on a Island eat fruit roll dank and trade stocks all day
2121 2018-10-06 13:04:04 Well, this sounds like a perfect opportunity to short-sell some of the stocks involved. You just have to get the short options (or others) before the article is released and *boom* free money. But they would never do such a thing, now would they? Sigh...

Al mismo tiempo, la brutal suba d tasas apunta a q “la gente” gaste menos, y los productores, aún sin invertir, se vean obligados a liquidar stocks.  Todo eso te bajaría la inflación, y luego las tasas
2144 2018-10-06 12:43:14 This #SaturdayMorning I am learning about vertical spreads courtesy of @Options_Edu and drinking some coffee - hoping to learn a thing or two about how spreads can provide a risk managed way to profit in down turning stocks since I feel like a bear  market might be coming

Mr. Besos your employees make you incredibly wealthy they earn minimum wage why take away their stocks & bonds as reported do the right thing..
2147 2018-10-06 12:41:10 Yes. Their pace stocks in particular. And if they have suddenly started getting these kind of players, someone somewhere must be doing something right. Usually a sign that the player production system is working.

2148 2018-10-06 12:41:07 @AnilSinghviZEE 
Hi Anil Sir, I need some suggestion from you on PC Jewellery. If I hold this stock for 5 years. it is good bet. Already I have this stock around 285@Rs. 172.  I always keep stocks more than 3 to 5 years.
2149 2018-10-06 12:40:53 if that happened, $AMRN can help the whole bio sector - Friday was crazy.. even stocks that had good news fell big .. that said, i missed to buy $SRPT at $130 area.. could get $AFMD at $4.10 average.

What's been ur experience with third-party contract manufacturers who supply to actual mkt players ex - amber ent AC or even Dixon (tvs etc). Query more on third party mfctrs to actual mkt players, not the field or individual stocks

2162 2018-10-06 12:26:19 @ebuilder101 do you have a twitter account just to bash stocks? That’s all I see you do. Or maybe you think you are saving the world?!? Any stock can be traded with a good entry and exit. This is OTC - it’s not where you invest your 401k savings, it’s where you make quick cash.
2163 2018-10-06 12:26:02 Ouch..All the stocks seem so red lately..
2164 2018-10-06 12:25:48 Yes, there are a lot of cannibis stocks still pretty cheap. Usually when ya have new states make legal the use, you'll see a bump in price. Of course its not just cannibis, could be in the companies that do their electronic billing. All kinds of ways.
2165 2018-10-06 12:25:38 ops ,all i want from bts is to get their stocks in this company ,,,to secure their future,,,or else they will trew them under the bus ,,,,

2167 2018-10-06 12:21:12 @booksaremybag Can I buy the new tote bag online somewhere? I don't think my local shop stocks BAMB bags (ironically). I could be wrong though - do you @Furtherfrom ?
2168 2018-10-06 12:18:54 Thanks sir. I am not sure if you can give your view on particular stocks. Please suggest about RITES . It is basically strong in fundamentals but very much impacted by midcap.
2169 2018-10-06 12:17:20 Markets correct due to different reasons. High PE coincided with last 2 corrections does not establish causation

I am sure, u buy quality stocks today & come back 1 year later U will see what u have missed

Novices r spreading panic but remember panic has a very short shelf life

2171 2018-10-06 12:17:00 Hat wer einen Aktien-Service-Tipp, wo man gezielt in einzelne Stocks investieren kann und nicht sich einfach nur einen Fond raussucht? Fonds, über die man keine Kontrolle hat, sind irre nervig!
2172 2018-10-06 12:16:08 i agree - both will fold now, just a matter of time.  low fees and payment apps powered by xrapid will be the reason. They have a few more months of charging high transfer fees then it’s over.  I’m considering shorting the stocks soon.  Keep up the good work !
2173 2018-10-06 12:15:47 I trade options by the chart, and don’t sell my stocks unless given a good reason to do so.
2174 2018-10-06 12:15:25 358's? 358 lates? Street stocks?
2175 2018-10-06 12:14:54 I dont agree with your explanation,you are limiting your responses to the people who are not tech savvy,look at Robinhood app in US,it has everything related to stocks under one app.
2176 2018-10-06 12:14:25 As you can imagine short term in main stocks is 1 year mid term 5 years and long term 10+ . Im getting used to the ups and downs on aim by rereading rns and scaling sometimes i wish id scaled more or jumped the train earlier.
2177 2018-10-06 12:12:15 why invest in stocks when you can make 10% fixed? Because you thought stocks were going to give you 100%. People today are way more bearish on equities. Alternatives may matter.

2186 2018-10-06 12:04:45 Nice . Must invest.... After losing in stocks, let us lose in real estate..
2187 2018-10-06 12:02:56 When bonds are sold off, bond yields automatically rise. In the same way when stocks are sold off, the future yield of stocks are also quietly rising. Lesson in there investors. #equity #stocks #investing #StockMarket #NIFTY #ValueInvesting #intelligence #logic
2188 2018-10-06 12:02:46 It's might be an indication of immaturity or rather panic amongst investors,20% in Nifty stocks can be due to fundamental deterioration

2207 2018-10-06 11:37:45 Should the starting level of rates matter here? My work indicates that rising rates are not a headwind for stocks in general until the 10-year is closer to 5%
2208 2018-10-06 11:37:45 Ok....so I read the article which was somewhat simplistic and still didn't see why tech was hit disproportionately....seems to me like the rapid rise in the 10 year was an excuse to take profits...unless some of these tech stocks will be hurt by a significantly higher dollar

2210 2018-10-06 11:37:31 We are in a different kind of bear market ie where no one feels that we are in a bear market. #fastandfurious

The average fall from 52wk high is 36% in Top 200 stocks.
2211 2018-10-06 11:36:30 $spx when have markets not been weak in that void weak to 10 days before earnings? If u are thinkinf of armageddon now just because we went down 1.5 prct in 2 days.. you are wrong. Markets as a whole are in a problem because they went as far as they did on a handfull of stocks.
2212 2018-10-06 11:34:58 but when are stocks going to get to the independent record stores, it hasn't arrived here in Devon yet....

2216 2018-10-06 11:27:01 Rightly said....we can see the difference by listening their interviews....like @porinju now scared to recommend single stock but earlier he used to recommend 10 stocks monthly....Hope everything will back to normalcy soon
2217 2018-10-06 11:23:23 Since I analyze a handful of stocks most nights (Sun, M-Th).  Usually FAANNG and some Dow and the indices.  I was thinking about doing a live stream video when I am charting.  It would be a good learning experience for me and hopefully anyone watching.  Would you be interested?
2218 2018-10-06 11:22:01 I would counter that in the stock market it may actually happen. At least in the near term...more commonly observed on the upside ..in bubble stocks that go parabolic.
2219 2018-10-06 11:21:07 Do you think this strategy is working also on stocks/forex/commodities?
2220 2018-10-06 11:18:28 Plenty like you in the long community ( look at the weed stocks) and also the opposite, plenty of honourable people in the short community ... Look at Valeant or Mdxg
2221 2018-10-06 11:17:49 Totally different than 1987. In 1987, the increase was from 7 to 10%.  Why invest in stocks when you can make 10% in fixed rates.
2222 2018-10-06 11:17:44 Sirjee, Could you please name the stocks on which you are bullish. It would be very helpful.

2229 2018-10-06 11:08:45 Hope you find courage to buy stocks in this massive panic where you wait the stock to fall. And then gradually it moves up and then your nasty bias doesn't let you buy that stock since you've seen lower price.

I wish you courage....baaki stock selection mein toh aap baap ho!

2266 2018-10-06 10:25:09 I’m buy and hold. Over my 2 years of owning Tesla stock I tried to sell when I thought it was high and was wrong both times. I admire people who are short term on stocks or even short the stock. Zero clue over here.

Where's volatility ?? It's down & out.

2272 2018-10-06 10:12:48 Looking at price action, reminded of something I read on bear markets:- 
A bull market raises all stocks. A bear market is when stocks are broken down, one by one. The downward trend is not as scary as OMCs, Reliance, BFIN losing 25%+ market cap in days. Stairs up, elevator down.
2273 2018-10-06 10:10:25 Siguro since wala pang limit until recently. And baka nangangamba na sila sa stocks  and they did say na it’s the seller setting the limit now but they should produce more then
2274 2018-10-06 10:10:15 :-) Lakhs of Crores cannot be used to manipulate Sir. Stocks going up and down is cyclical. every time there are tons of reasons. 2000-03,2008-09,2013,2015-16 and now 2018. So chill. These are normal corrections in stocks. And there are good fundamentals to bounce back.

In reality, no one spotted this correction.

But, everyone knew it will happen, as the markets had run up fast. Sensex & Nifty stocks were getting pricey & mid- small-caps were battered.

Now, markets will consolidate & crawl up as Q2 Results are declared.

2328 2018-10-06 09:15:07 You can hold stocks for multibagger returns based on how long momentum last. But when the Momentum starts, I would like to know how I can project it will be a multibagger without FA valuation.

2333 2018-10-06 09:11:51 I am referring to the line of credit that is secured against other assets such as stocks rather than houses.

The rate of the secured LOC should be more attractive than regular LOC as it is secured just like HELOC. HELOC is going for prime+0.25% or so in major banks.

2343 2018-10-06 08:55:39 With stocks the amount of shares is known & finite. Gold on the other hand, 'shares' are created as needed. Gold is valued as if it were in infinite supply. Sell to infinity.

2361 2018-10-06 08:38:08 Many of such stocks have already fallen 50% and probably never recover again, which is what is meant when it's said there's a huge derating going on. Off course the market will scale new highs, but only quality will recover their lost value and appreciate going forward. 2/2
2362 2018-10-06 08:37:27 It is more beneficial, for most of the associates.  The stocks weren't discounted.  They were awarded to us, free of charge.  Upon our hire date and tenure anniversaries.  The only catch was we had to wait 2 years for them to vest before we cashed them out.

2364 2018-10-06 08:34:28 A lot of stocks don't deserve the valuation given the quality of the promoters, management and earnings growth potential as per finance theory. But in India, the response you get when you voice such concerns is standard "chalta hai yaar, tu khit khit maat kar yaar." 1/n
2365 2018-10-06 08:34:00  Bring back the stocks too!
2366 2018-10-06 08:33:07 And there's so much more. Like what did trump do about mass shootings? Still not even ban bump stocks. So Americans worry about refugees and safety, but that very real danger from within doesn't matter? It doesn't makes sense.
2367 2018-10-06 08:31:57 I think it’s false as stocks in the index change just like ASX market...strong companies are c added and weak withdrawn from the index

2386 2018-10-06 08:08:22 If by crypto you mean bitcoin, then you should be fine, long-term (unless the amount is trivial). There are also some good value stocks. E.g. $AAPL is still relatively cheap given its business prospects

2388 2018-10-06 08:06:24 In bull markets we become over-optimistic and assign targets that are 2-3x of current market prices, in bear markets we don’t buy the same stocks because of over-pessimism saying that the company is not going to survive and will become the next Kingfisher or Unitech.

2413 2018-10-06 07:35:32 You are much more learned and experienced in markets than I am. But it rarely happens that a stock(or stocks) fall off the cliff in one month and resume uptrend from next. Reversal is a slow process which manifests itself on charts. There is no sign of it yet.

2432 2018-10-06 07:21:58 From my charts, momentum is indicating October being a dark and bearish month for both #stocks and #bonds.

2467 2018-10-06 06:38:31 My recommendation if you don’t have time to pick stocks yourself. Midcap SIPs for the long term are best. Also when markets are trending downwards (like now) increase your monthly contribution. If you normally put x put 2x now.
2468 2018-10-06 06:37:28 I think many stocks won't tough 52 week high in their lifetime.
2469 2018-10-06 06:36:04 52 Week high has suddenly become 3 years target now as a good number of stocks has to move 100%+ from current level to reach 52 week high.

2508 2018-10-06 05:48:44 Is this a demo account, cause GTXI or VTVT was not tradeable on that platform. If it's not a demo, can you please tell me what level you're at, because maybe these stocks are open for high players?
2509 2018-10-06 05:47:27 Stocks are on average wildly overpriced. How could anyone be so ignorant of how overpriced they are? Lucky for you, the Federal Reserve saved stupid people in overpaying to make certain they'd never lose for 9 straight years. PE for Russell 2000 exceeds 100.

2511 2018-10-06 05:45:46 This scammer simply gets data from Nanex which he then claims how many stocks are being sold or bought in a pop at any given time. He then trys to pretend that he knows when tops or bottoms are formed by his fraudster term of :"capper spike": which are 99% incorrect. Fact! #SEC
2512 2018-10-06 05:43:31 On Soondori : I said I'm going to sell ready stock but a friend of mine really wants it so I gave the extra one for her. It appears that I won't have ready stocks to sell. I am sorry ><
2513 2018-10-06 05:43:01 I agree with Chris on debt/interest rate reason behind the move this week. Caesars has the highest debt ratios among big gaming names, so they are more susceptible to rate increases. Higher oil not great either for travel-related stocks.

2515 2018-10-06 05:41:50 But in right stocks which will be pretty different from the ones  that spearheaded the previous bull run...sir..
2516 2018-10-06 05:40:28 Hello @iManasArora, there are several stocks in your list which are splits/bonus instead of such fall. Ex- Phillips Carbon. It is 5:1 split.
2517 2018-10-06 05:40:06 Take your time Chris, I guess you're updating the video due to the breakouts in the 10 and 30 year yield, and a sharp daily decline in stocks. Taking it day by day...
2518 2018-10-06 05:40:06 #SaturdayThoughts This sexual misconduct thing is attaining dangerous situation. Scary. I want to take VRS & sit at home & start day trading in Stocks for a living. The latter is less risky.

2534 2018-10-06 05:13:42 Depends if you are retailers  or customer .. All retailers like to get rid of old &  iilliquid stocks  , but when he faced collection issues or tough times  he is ready to give away family silver at discount too . Customers  in any sale has an edge .
2535 2018-10-06 05:12:32 U.S. gov­ern­ment bond yields rose to their high­est level in years Fri­day, as in­vestors re­con­sid­ered the strength of the U.S. econ­omy while sell­ing off stocks that could be hurt by higher bor­row-ing costs. Do you think that more raises in US Gob bond will come?
2536 2018-10-06 05:12:24 And plus all Im doing is sitting back and looking at my stocks every morning just watching my money make money
2537 2018-10-06 05:11:52 Gee, my stocks are doing great!
Maybe you Socialist need better brokers.
2538 2018-10-06 05:11:47 This pattern was visible in the last bull run too. On the dwnside ppl still bought those stocks which were supposed to grow at 20-30-40% cagr but that grown never came. Then in hindsight people claimed that they were debt ridden. By the time everyone realised that damage was done
2539 2018-10-06 05:11:17 @iRadhikaGupta did I read you in Bloomberg that 30 to 40 percent crash in stock prices is reality and 2017 wasn't a reality of the market for the MF investors? Wow! A market whose reality is 30 to 40 cracking up of stocks is at best speculation and no science. What a guidance!
2540 2018-10-06 05:09:51 @Iamsamirarora Is it time to accumulate quality stocks. Staggered buying started by me with cautious optimism . I have a gut feel everyone is over reacting. This selling phase will also pass . Time to accumulate quality stocks or still wait ?
2541 2018-10-06 05:07:57 I’m happy that 4 of the stocks you mentioned I found on my own and have traded. Reading my book this weekend and hopefully I will buy your DVD soon. Fully committed in the market.
2542 2018-10-06 05:06:03 Easy to call it out in hindsight, the world danced to these stocks being available at any valuation. Retail, HNI and others followed   like a brainless chickens and history repeated itself
2543 2018-10-06 05:04:01 Don't ask me, dude, I gave up. The stock is impervious to bad news. Shorts and longs are entrenched which makes movement unpredictable. Far easier stocks out there to trade.
2544 2018-10-06 05:03:25 Didn't the same ratio of success and consolidation occur with #internet #stocks and #shares? Can't we count the survivors of that era on one hand?
2545 2018-10-06 05:03:02 The moment fm comes onto television, one of the another sector stocks gets busted..shameless government, they r for doing good or spoiling the mood always..
2546 2018-10-06 04:59:39 If someone asks u something like - will the stock "X" go up or down?

U should confidently say - up, if u hold for 10 years.

In 10 years 80% of all stocks go up, however little.

If it falls, the person will mostly chicken out & sell and not check with u after 8-9 years 
2547 2018-10-06 04:59:31 Satyanash kar diya OMCs ka. Now, it seems OMCs will not touch new all time high in dacades at least. All Govt promoted stocks should be used for short term trading purpose only and definitely not for long term investing.
2548 2018-10-06 04:58:00 For those that would rather take advantage of utilizing their UPT, they will come out ahead.  I think there was too much chatter from some about not wanting to have to wait for their stocks to vest or a possible VCP payout...they wanted the $ upfront; no strings attached.

2554 2018-10-06 04:50:50 But he wont tell you which stocks until you pay his rates.
2555 2018-10-06 04:50:11 This is algorithmic trading. It's as simple as making a basket of stocks before hand in 3 categories....bullish, bearish, neutral....and pressing order in a second. These are large institutions....and they make money most of time!
2556 2018-10-06 04:49:38 Only difference between then and now is PF money , LIC money in stocks, insurance firms are listed  ,,,,Indians have been tricked into mutual funds.... so liquidity is more .Someone has taken guts to have PF money invested in stocks
2557 2018-10-06 04:49:03 Any fool can buy stocks, it takes smart investor to know when to sell..
2558 2018-10-06 04:46:07 It's almost to the point of putting body cams  on the boys to prove their innocence of guilt. And they should set up some stocks on the playgrounds so we can start the shaming as soon as there's a hint of an accusation.
2559 2018-10-06 04:46:06 Typo: "Adult people in the investing/trading business don't WHINE when stocks dont go up."
2560 2018-10-06 04:45:34 Would like to know stocks you are owning
2561 2018-10-06 04:45:22 I am sure you would make a terrible stock market trader, try it with a real account of a few million dollars and see. You will then blame your failure on rigged markets, short sellers, etc. Adult people in the investing/trading business don't while when stocks dont go up.
2562 2018-10-06 04:43:44 stocks rise by 1%.
2563 2018-10-06 04:42:17 Are the big companies collaborating now bc their stocks are falling lol
2564 2018-10-06 04:41:14 He is right, In small caps you can't invest in a handful of stocks. To mitigate the risks this is necessary.
2565 2018-10-06 04:41:08 Each player will start with a traditional 50 stocks, or 'lives',

@drnarendranET
2572 2018-10-06 04:32:06 I naively extrapolated that after RBI's hold decision, stocks could rally (though bonds reacted +vely after the RBI decision). RBI's action / inaction has set the cat among the pigeons, so to say. Over-reaction in forex / stock mkt.

On Monday, stocks should rally in my opinion.
2573 2018-10-06 04:32:04 Can u suggest some good stocks with 2-: years horizon
2574 2018-10-06 04:31:39 Spending most of my time just trading stocks these days.  When that bull market ends in stocks, its very possible I may exclusively trade crypto after that and abandon stocks.  Very very possible you may see many stock daytraders do the same.

2583 2018-10-06 04:22:43 I’m really interested in stocks rn
2584 2018-10-06 04:22:00 That was the opinion of part of the associate pool too.  They preferred to have their total compensation package up front vs pieced out like it was.  This way there's no extra effort having to be put into earning the bonus or waiting for the stocks to vest.
2585 2018-10-06 04:21:03 It appears that the move is aimed at increasing inventories and bulk purchases can lead a better negotiated prices. ECB borrowings can build stocks and come at a lower pricing. An effective working capital management should factor inventory holding cost.

2639 2018-10-06 03:26:00 10% to ho chuka, utne me hi kitne stocks ki patloon dhili ho gayi hai. Aur kitna?
2640 2018-10-06 03:25:43 Who stocks them?
2641 2018-10-06 03:25:16 So invest less in stocks is the lesson here
2642 2018-10-06 03:25:08 Some on TV who bragged abt Rupee dep being good are chewing back their words! Another disaster in the making are these IT stocks which became a one trick phony. Beware of a Tweeting Trump!
2643 2018-10-06 03:24:59 Politicians are like stocks - when they're up, you're super happy and when they're down, you wish desperately to sell them just to recoup your losses.
2644 2018-10-06 03:21:54 Lmao right. I guess the stocks would’ve went up 
2645 2018-10-06 03:21:06 TINA no longer a reason to buy stocks anymore.
2646 2018-10-06 03:20:02 I'm kind of regretting that I haven't put any money towards soap stocks, during all this soap cutting craxiness. Like, it's a good time for soap.
2647 2018-10-06 03:19:27 the second one,, CCI 34 Mthly >100 and CCI 34 Dly >100 in the current circumstances. During bullish times, the no. of stocks will inundate all so many of them.
2648 2018-10-06 03:18:47 Best time to stock your stocks
2649 2018-10-06 03:18:18 RE the people getting angry about Tesla stocks dropping: Welcome to the stock market. You knew what you were getting into. Invest wisely and cautiously. A sneeze can upset the stock market.
2650 2018-10-06 03:18:05 Beautiful truth. I don’t know if I can/will get off here. I could be swayed to stay by group of serious shorts combining to research other opportunities - like Voltron for shorting stocks we’d combine forces.
2651 2018-10-06 03:16:54 If monthly CCI 34 falls below 100 for any blue chip stocks
1. Momentum dies (don't invest)
2. Best time to invest long term
Which conclusion is best?
2652 2018-10-06 03:15:01 Two days in the stocks.
2653 2018-10-06 03:14:40 All of the gaming stocks were getting hit today. They all use leverage and are hurt by the prospect of higher interest rates

2662 2018-10-06 03:09:51 Instead of running for a hybrid cow under R&D which could possibly give 100 litres of milk a day, go for a cow which is giving 10l milk today. Cash is king. Don't run for next big thing in stocks
2663 2018-10-06 03:08:49 Not necessarily. My perennial advice is it’s OK to own stocks. It’s not OK to invest w/out an adequate cushion or margin of safety within your overall portfolio.

2669 2018-10-06 03:01:21 $AMRN very impressive that run up from single digits to 10 bucks now. All on positive phase 3 data, JUST IMPRESSIVE how this catalyst can make stocks run...... and it is not even a low float stock. 150M float

2680 2018-10-06 02:52:24 U are thinking out of context mayuresh. We are talking abt Nifty not stocks. Coming to revealing  strategy, is it a  "प्रसाद" , so that I should distribute it to everyone & what I should do it's my decision, you shouldn't comment on it. Hope this discussion will stop here only.
2681 2018-10-06 02:51:40 I retweeted this, but IMO, bump stocks are stupid. Over all message stands though.

2683 2018-10-06 02:49:19 It is truly impressive how traders decide within micro seconds what RBI says about any topic & how much to hit any one stock or sector. Qs to ask them are how they do it so fast, distinguish b/w diff  stocks in the same sector & if they have ever made money so we can all learn.
2684 2018-10-06 02:48:54 It was @PPFAS that had an exposure to FANG stocks in their portfolio, they have been ahead of the curve.

2692 2018-10-06 02:39:44 Its easy to figure out.. Borders are going up all over the world. Global warming. Food stocks for animals is low. Water is low because of humans using it for silly things. While people protest nobody is looking.
2693 2018-10-06 02:38:21 Do not speak for me...as a woman and an Oregonian he does not represent me.  Oregons politicians are a national embarrassment and laughing stocks...they are robbing the State and its people blind.
2694 2018-10-06 02:37:15 @TMFJMo looking forward to a day when we paint in watercolors, and talk stocks while watching some college football.
2695 2018-10-06 02:36:08 How do stocks help the average American again? Most don't own any.
2696 2018-10-06 02:33:03 Ah nice, good job. Seems frequency of trading and type of trade is always brought up as to how the CRA determines whether or not an assessment is necessary. So holding long term quality stocks should keep you safe.
2697 2018-10-06 02:32:44 I tried to tweet Avenatti to request that he continue speaking in order to make the democrats look like laughing-stocks. Turns out he already blocked me from yesterday’s tweet for sending him the devil’s triangle documents.

2699 2018-10-06 02:30:22 Dude when he posted it was just up 5%, not at 165. So now don't give explanation that u bought at x levels and u getting gains. First try to understand what he said and than argue.
2700 2018-10-06 02:29:42 I'm interested to know what you've learnt Alonzo. Previous stocks coming into a trial result have had appreciated sp's. Then they released result and list so much value. $bit was different. Sp had been going down. Maybe a learning for future punts.
2701 2018-10-06 02:29:19 I ain't waiting. I will buy stocks as they get cheap
2702 2018-10-06 02:28:00 smoking a joint & browsing stocks. u know, friday night things
2703 2018-10-06 02:26:13 Yeah I agree that would panic me. I recently moved from Scotland to Canada so thats when I started trading. Swing trading Tesla has proven quite profitable. Still getting the hang of weed stocks. Just managed to buy hundred shares in Aurora at 12.7 before closing today.
2704 2018-10-06 02:25:20 You should learn about investing in individual stocks then. You will prob never agree with all the ones in a mutual fund. So many don't realize this.
2705 2018-10-06 02:24:14 @RobotTrades2018 $czni are you in Great Neck, NY diluting the shit out of penny stocks, while giving false hope? 
2706 2018-10-06 02:24:12 A actionable idea. Convince investors to hold Tesla stocks at Banks/Brokers who agree to not lend stocks out for shorting. Does not currently exist but similar to Segregated Accounts in London LME futures. 
Need 75% of all Tesla share owners to agree as Shorts=~25% of all shares
2707 2018-10-06 02:23:24 Hmm stocks went great today unlike yest lost freaking $1300
2708 2018-10-06 02:23:16 and don't give that "stocks are limited so she should hoard and let others buy too" excuse bc for sure if yall get the chance yall gonna buy so much stuff as you can. i'm so tired of yall.
2709 2018-10-06 02:22:03 Rather intra.. Focus on learning technical wherr you can understand when to sell or add stocks to your portfolio. First start with come into my trading room by Elder and candles reignited by Steve nison.
2710 2018-10-06 02:21:48 Hurry. Sell all your stocks now.  Please. I want to buy them from you.  It’s called dollar cost averaging.   Sell. Sell.
2711 2018-10-06 02:20:26 idek why ppl get mad @ u for buying merch??? like they're supposed to be bought?? the stocks for merch have always been limited so ppl camp to be the first one in line. yall act as if she just barged in there and cut line and bought stuff. yall give ness shit for nothing honestly
2712 2018-10-06 02:19:57 85%-95% of equity fund mgrs underperform their BMs over long periods. The more stocks in a fund the less confidence of the signal/edge in predicting superior stocks
2713 2018-10-06 02:19:46 The game has always been to predict (not easy) the highest performing stocks and run a concentrated fund otherwise the math tends to work against outperforming. .

2716 2018-10-06 02:15:50 After reading up on the stock market today for a bit I have a really good plan. I’m gonna buy stocks and then sell em the next day when they make a little profit. Think I might be on to something here.
2717 2018-10-06 02:15:38 The S+P reliably has few big winners and a vast # of index stocks that underperform the index. This is the + skew nature of indices.
2718 2018-10-06 02:15:34 Thanks man will have a good read. Started couple months ago strictly in cannabis/pharma stocks (have a seperate tech portfolio) so started with $3k portfolio. Still at $3k lol.

2725 2018-10-06 02:08:17 Very true! And because of the way the data is gathered over a full week, the new high numbers were likely propped up early in the week. If stocks stay under pressure next week, I’d imagine we’ll have more 52 week lows than highs on next week’s edition.
2726 2018-10-06 02:06:35 Oh my God. Fail at math, economics, finance, stocks.  But lead contender for agreeing with supreme leader.
2727 2018-10-06 02:04:38 That’s a really dumb thing to say.   So many people who aren’t rich have lots of money in 401k, retirement, college savings plans, and perhaps their own stocks.  That would not just destroy rich people, but everyone.

2732 2018-10-06 02:00:00 As inflation rises ...the transfer of inflation will go to the non-inflationary crypto market.  I addition, as interest rise stocks will fall. Again more out flows from the stock market into crypto. A roman candle is inevitable. FOMO about to hit hard with real fundamentals.
2733 2018-10-06 01:59:28 I really want to learn about stocks 
2734 2018-10-06 01:55:32 It’s subjective but they look at both indexes as well as the action of the leading growth stocks.  They do have their proprietary Market Exposure Model that has specific guidelines on percent exposure to the market.
2735 2018-10-06 01:54:25 it is happening a lot. too many are really coming unhinged. 

kinda not joking on the pharma stocks.

2741 2018-10-06 01:46:01 I am a trader. I date stocks I don’t marry them. They are just vehicles=tickers.

“Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future performance.”

The US market is overdue for a correction imho and overvalued stocks are *not* good news for any of us.

They don’t understand basic difference between traditional auto manufacturers and tslaQ 

u have to understand these people didn’t even know what shorting was until recently
They are Unsophisticated folks that didn’t know one could short stocks
2771 2018-10-06 01:12:17 You talking about Steve the wanna be Russian? Steve  w/ Russian oil stocks? Steve who would let you go without health ins. if were up to him? yeah he's a real prize.
2772 2018-10-06 01:11:04 What the hell? Plant based foods are the hot thing. That's messed up. I'd say something. If it helps, I'll take a picture of a Target that stocks the Beyond Burger. Funny thing though, been to different grocers and find it in meats and frozen foods too.
2773 2018-10-06 01:10:52 I just had drinks with an old friend who is invested in a bunch of cannabis-related stocks. When I told him to be careful, his response was essentially "you're a professional money manager up low single digits, and I'm up 40%. Obviously I'm doing something right."
2774 2018-10-06 01:10:09 I would suggest to stay clear from stocks that are related to China until this trade wsr settles
2775 2018-10-06 01:08:28 I just had a convo with someone who likes the fact that she’s making more money, paying less taxes, stocks doing well, but she hates the way he talks.  We didn’t want a politician who sounded good (BHO) but did nothing. Are these people insane?
2776 2018-10-06 01:08:14 It’s ok we can just call it “strategy”

2779 2018-10-06 01:06:19 Depends on how early you “retire” - you should start buying penny stocks now!
2780 2018-10-06 01:05:38 After reading the pharmaceuticals reports on stocks report because of new diabetes drug looking positive? The possibility of a progressive getting anywhere near Washington DC is pretty close to nil.
2781 2018-10-06 01:00:28 Thanks, in large part, to you Sir. God bless you for what you are doing. Thank God ole Crooked Hillary didn't become President, because, under her crooked regime, we would be trailing, not leading (on stocks).

2784 2018-10-06 00:57:09 Sorry I couldn't explain that in weeks of talking, just too hard. I pick stocks to my style that I learned worked in experience. Position size doesn't really matter it's based on ur risk.

2788 2018-10-06 00:50:40 Are you still short stocks???
2789 2018-10-06 00:50:37 Simeone called the stocks movement „breathing“. I like that. I call it waves  of the ocean. In the long run make no difference.  #Tesla $TSLA
2790 2018-10-06 00:49:41 It depends.  Once you use government stocks, then you MUST use spare capacity. In this case, the explanatory power increases and you get better fit.
2791 2018-10-06 00:47:02 I sold some of the dogs I had to move the money into stocks that dropped and have a way higher potential on the rebound. That's trading. Still bullish. Play the game the best way you can.
2792 2018-10-06 00:46:49 Sure, the UPA-2 gave us recession, but Modi did better than  the UPA within just one term in accelerating the country over the cliff. Companies are informally begging the FM not to write blogs because the stocks crash thereafter.

2804 2018-10-06 00:32:25 Has been a tough 6 months for small caps. Management of all the “undervalued” stocks should get their quarterly report out early and dictate the narrative about their progress

2806 2018-10-06 00:30:48 I've called on @SenSanders to introduce legislation directing the Bureau of Labor to collect and publish company by company wage date modeled on the daily stock ticker valuation data published by stock exchanges.  Only 54% of Americans own stocks.  97% depend on wage income.

2810 2018-10-06 00:26:20 We are not in a Bear Market. Lesley never said it in tweets. The market know a Bear from a Dog?  we would see a 10-15% drop and would be a correction. Did I sell any stocks? No, to lose money? Buy? Yes, to make money. Panic is good, gets better price. I bought every major drop.

2831 2018-10-05 23:56:17 Were they happy with paper gains when markets were rising?  How can someone call himself an investor when bargains are available and he is still afraid? Even if you are fully invested, you can shuffle your portfolio for better stocks.
2832 2018-10-05 23:56:01 Geez 125 is still a long ways down !! Sounds horrible. Chinese stocks already so oversold. But it can always get cheaper.

2836 2018-10-05 23:53:57 Without fully watching either videos, my take is that US and SA will maintain status quo, with their fates tied together.

2845 2018-10-05 23:40:27 I explained my 80% calculation earlier. Someone in the top tax bracket pays 40-50% in state and federal income tax combined. Then if someone invests that income in stocks or property there are also taxes. Then when they die it would be taxed 50% again with the estate tax
2846 2018-10-05 23:40:23 And here I thought you were speaking of equity (and bond!) sellers of a couple weeks ago, before I saw the pic ... stocks and bonds correlated to the downside would prove a big storm indeed!

2885 2018-10-05 23:23:36 Wrong... I don't touch pump & dump stocks
2886 2018-10-05 23:20:04 Anyone with weed stocks might want to consider dumping them within a few months of "legalization". Don't say you weren't warned.

2891 2018-10-05 23:13:46 How the heck do you find people stupid enough to allow you to manage their life savings?   Can you list your four favorite stocks please?
2892 2018-10-05 23:13:26 They are not, they make markets more efficient. If they are wrong, they loose money, exactly the same like people who are long stocks. That’s how an efficient market works. You are disappointing many people, included me.
2893 2018-10-05 23:12:25 Same as trading stocks on Wall Street, cryptos should be different, my clients sometimes want their money back fast and that’s the service I offer, not possible here
2894 2018-10-05 23:11:44 Can I put it in the stocks and throw eggs at it? Pleeeeeeeeeeese?
2895 2018-10-05 23:11:36 I will also advise, if you re into investing in stocks, to buy the stocks of Oil Marketing Companies when they go down. A lot of stupid things go on in the stock market. As long as u find it tough to get a repairs guy, or a house painter, know for sure the economy is doing fine.

Bear-related stocks
I like the associations
2897 2018-10-05 23:09:22 This was coming either way.  Amazon just waited for an excuse.  The values of stocks shares has increased way more than they thought it would over the last 2 years.

2907 2018-10-05 23:01:08 @elonmusk Consider having stocks put into a cash account, you still own them. But short sellers can't borrow them. Short squeeze those bastards lol

2912 2018-10-05 22:57:33 From Market Wizards, O’Neil page 226: “My philosophy is that all stocks are bad.  There are no good stocks unless they go up in price. If they go down instead, you have to cut your losses fast...”
2913 2018-10-05 22:56:57 Jim, there are many players out there... do your own Due Diligence, study about 15 U stocks and invest in a few, but don't spend so much time &energy (only!) in UEC..you should be obsessed with big money .. not obsessed in UEC.. my 2 cents

2925 2018-10-05 22:49:18 Correct. No stocks
2926 2018-10-05 22:48:31 Premines and ico's must have a time lock on when they are available in order to be as legitimate as stocks.
2927 2018-10-05 22:48:29 @RobinhoodApp why don’t you guys have @AcbTsx stocks supported on the app?
2928 2018-10-05 22:48:23 my stocks are in the shitter. omg.
2929 2018-10-05 22:48:07 I first bought $SQ back around $30, taken some profit on the way up, as well as added more shares on dips. Just bought more today. It may seem expensive but the potential for growth is still strong, it will close the year over $100. #square #stocks #finance #trading
2930 2018-10-05 22:46:36 That reality TV show star has tripled my stocks investments, gave my husband & I more money in our weekly checks - but you do you....
2931 2018-10-05 22:46:20 I'm sure you hear this a lot, but I think you should invest in penny stocks to treat your phantom limb syndrome
2932 2018-10-05 22:46:20 These are risks people take with all stocks ... revenue growth will fix everything
2933 2018-10-05 22:46:01 Can't wait for ultimate to come out cause it'll be 3 stock minimum. 2 stocks was the worst ruleset decision in smash 4 history
2934 2018-10-05 22:44:13 Yes please add more stocks!!!
2935 2018-10-05 22:43:42 apple stocks rise by 69%.
2936 2018-10-05 22:41:34 @Shortseller @gpaisa hard for me to determine volume on these cheap stocks. Longer time frames needed
2937 2018-10-05 22:41:13 Prepared to call us USSA of R. It is happening and don't say the warning was never given. When politicians aren't held accountable we all will lose. We can kiss middle class goodbye soon. Hope you imvested in some really good stocks.
2938 2018-10-05 22:40:22 I wonder who is shorting La Croix stocks? I swear I saw this tactic on the show Billions.
2939 2018-10-05 22:37:52 36 Pro Stocks checked in at Mercer Little Guy Nationals with 15 checked in at PPMS for Pittsburgher 100.  Good luck drivers!
2940 2018-10-05 22:36:56 And the stocks fall and they fall and they fall ohhh ohhh oh look at them go oh no...they die goodbye cube
2941 2018-10-05 22:36:46 most stocks selling past several days
2942 2018-10-05 22:36:07 Market attention should shift from Beergate to Pastagate as interest rates rise. Rising rates from low levels are normal in a bull market. Stocks usually get initial cold plunge. Reflects economic strength. Italy should feel the pressure..watch Euro as canary in coal mine
2943 2018-10-05 22:35:48 Global stocks ran 23% in 2017 on a 6.6% volatility. 

Now up about 1% in 2018 on 13.3% volatility. 

Regression to the mean is a b!tch.
2944 2018-10-05 22:35:21 Market Cap means nothing. I've seen regular stocks soar on good news with a very small MC. AXIM Bio did it a few years ago. It went from  $0.23 to $19.80 in just a couple of months. Look it up for yourself. Happens all the time with stocks.
2945 2018-10-05 22:34:44 time to work towards that 6 figures. throw some money in stocks as well. :)
2946 2018-10-05 22:34:43 Meta my only MJ stock up on the day. All stocks deep red this week. You saved my ass with TRUL. Down about 7000 for the week.
2947 2018-10-05 22:34:12 Also, whenever a stock is fairly priced no short selling could bring it lower, because the money seeking underpriced stocks is pretty much unlimited. For every short seller someone will step in.
2948 2018-10-05 22:33:07 For some reason it’s reminding me of the stocks manipulation attempt on AMD that attempted to sway public perception by stating the company would be worth literally $0. But this isn’t being pushed by unknown publicists, and it isn’t the first time. I’m a bit lost here.

2950 2018-10-05 22:30:53 This week was fucking ASS man. Lost my Nike Visor ($40), dropped $10, lost $3k in stocks, LOST MY DAMN AIR PODS CASE (70 FUCKING DOLLARS), and... lost the woman i gave all of my love and everything to. What’s next? 
2951 2018-10-05 22:30:02 Yeah, for investment crypto never made much sense. People buy into "get rich quick" idea way too much. Crypto is only good for trading if you want to make money in it, then it's far superior to stocks but that's a very different game than investing
2952 2018-10-05 22:29:47 Love for Marsha Blackburn TN and John James MI.  3.7% unemployment.  So low, stocks are getting nervous.   Better pay equals more to spend. It will work out.  134K jobs added.  300K affected by Hurricane.   Hurricane is temporary negative on jobs. Soon, rebuilding will compensate
2953 2018-10-05 22:29:10 We all have 2 stocks that vest in May. Come spring Amazon will need to do some hiring because i suspect the majority of us will leave after getting that last little piece of the pie. At least thats my plan :)
2954 2018-10-05 22:29:07 Production license don’t move the stocks much anyways
2955 2018-10-05 22:28:54 Correct, stocks will be trading on Monday
2956 2018-10-05 22:27:59 Hey Jason: Simple math; with higher price of the stock, you can offer more valuable stocks for buying to acquire more expensive Companies; time to move this thing higher!
2957 2018-10-05 22:27:52 Talking stocks  Snapchat.
2958 2018-10-05 22:27:24  advice I won’t be taking on stocks anytime soon. Only crypto!
2959 2018-10-05 22:26:49 Great idea to make lots of money. 
Short a company’s stocks by claiming one of their employees raped you.
2960 2018-10-05 22:26:12 $TOL peaked in 05 and was down 65% from the peak already when market peaked in October 07. Interesting, if these stocks have peaked for the cycle, if we get similar lead time on rest of market.
2961 2018-10-05 22:25:51 stocks > crypto
2962 2018-10-05 22:25:51 Sell your stocks now. Economic calamity is not far away.

2966 2018-10-05 22:21:09 I do believe we have a right to bear arms.

I disagree with high cap. magazines and bump stocks, but in the past I have enjoyed rabbit, squirrel, and quail hunting although I haven't done it in many years.

I also understand that some weapons only belong on the battlefield too.
2967 2018-10-05 22:19:06 Your Toys R Us stocks their figures better than some of the stores here in the US, kinda jealous
2968 2018-10-05 22:16:00 Let them. My stocks in pepper spray and popcorn will make me a ton of cash.
2969 2018-10-05 22:15:55 Here’s a possible theory. If you were constrained in buying stocks to only do it stupidly, say buying only one, then stocks would seem riskier, and you’d require a higher risk premium. That risk prem is everyone else’s return, so indexers get a better investment opportunity
2970 2018-10-05 22:14:54 Degrowth refers to *throughput*, energy, ecosystem resilience, resource stocks, resource sinks, pollution, waste and extraction, and does NOT refer to the rate, quality or level of consumer/public goods & services.
2971 2018-10-05 22:14:51 With all the Pot stocks taking leading from each other as well this isn't the norm of the leader dies they all do. I really don't think the pot rally will be done with yet. Future long term potential is huge and funds/ institutions will be underinvested at the mo.

2975 2018-10-05 22:10:36 It helps to use multiple underlyings and parameter diversification as well. Momentum (long /CL futures and energy stocks, short 30-year bonds this past week) has added a value over the past week, though it's not strictly a trend-following strategy.
2976 2018-10-05 22:10:30 Now would be a good time to diversify from stocks.
2977 2018-10-05 22:08:38 I'll agree with that because Dems will always want new voters and Republicans will always want stocks to increase. We should have laws to slow it down though.
2978 2018-10-05 22:07:52 Y’all wanna wear Gucci, BALENCIAGAs, Chanel, Nike, Jordans etc etc and not one of y’all buying their stocks.. don’t just wear it, own a part of it, invest your money better
2979 2018-10-05 22:07:34 Sorry, I have you muted. Nobody said anything was wrong with buying stocks but both parties are wasting income. You can buy stock without locking in any gain.
2980 2018-10-05 22:06:28 How many of y’all got stocks in the shit y’all wearing and buying??

2983 2018-10-05 22:05:54 I think so.    A double Top?  That suggests much lower.   Like last January.   I know many stocks that are already creamed.  Seem only BA and AAPL are up ( Dow stocks two).

2986 2018-10-05 22:04:45 Wishful thinking. How bout the fact that stocks have been going up for 10yrs on fraud. The consumer is in the most debt ever. Meaning this record bull has been manipulated beyond belief & it simply cannot go on anymore. Hence an ole down 10pts in no time Amzn down 200 in no time
2987 2018-10-05 22:04:16 And all of American will pay for it in Health,  taxes, Polution & the up coming recession.  Stocks values dropping. 2 days in a row. Seems they do not like Interest Rate & new Terriffs
2988 2018-10-05 22:03:39 So you are levered short stocks then I assume?
2989 2018-10-05 22:03:01 Gold, sporting goods, entertainment stocks, iron and steel.
2990 2018-10-05 22:02:14 10.5: 10 years ago, short selling was banned in hundreds of financial stocks, and I had to decide whether or not to disable trading altogether in those stocks, or only provide liquidity on one side of the marker. Short selling could and has been regulated away... #StockMarket
2991 2018-10-05 22:01:09 Market Close: MBS -30bps; DOW -180.43; NASDAQ -91.06; S&P 500 -16.04; 10yr Treasury 3.23%; Stocks and MBS continue to drop on concerns of wage inflation and high yields.

2996 2018-10-05 21:57:59 2nd day in a row Stocks are down. Tells you what Corporations say about the Interest Rate & what is coming.

Yes, Elon is erratic, but anyone who researched before buying in should know that. It will pay off in the long-term.

3016 2018-10-05 21:38:33 It’s only bad for stocks if it’s going to cause so much inflation that yields on risk-free bonds(i.e.treasuries)will rise significantly and become more attractive than the stocks of Cos that cant pass the cost of inflation to customers. Otherwise, I see it as bullish for stocks.

3043 2018-10-05 21:25:08 Orientation on US Stocks:  Short Term BEARISH, Intermediate Term NEUTRAL, Long Term BULLISH
3044 2018-10-05 21:21:46 I'm curious what you see here explain. I'm moving from stocks to Forex and it looks like you have a lot of extra lines.
3045 2018-10-05 21:20:57 I spoke to platekompaniet early in 2018&as far as I know, only the shop at Oslo City has in their stocks if it’s not sold out! 

But I know other stores in Oslo has it as well, I believe it is Outlet Oslo(?). But if you want your local platekompaniet to have, you need to ask
3046 2018-10-05 21:19:49 With Stocks down and crypto dead didn’t make a single penny profit this week ! Great start for Q4.  #bitcoin #trading
3047 2018-10-05 21:19:37 Their stocks gained $7 billion in value after the JUUL "raid" (which was actually just an inspection, as all manufacturers can expect, but trumpeted as a RAID by media).

3049 2018-10-05 21:18:27 It's not about whether you are Red or Blue, because it's really about who you are actually voting for. Both @TheDemocrats and the @GOP have Establishment candidates. Establishment Republicans often directly take dirty money contributions, Establishment Democrats often own stocks.
3050 2018-10-05 21:18:07 Just hit me that I paid over $4k on stocks yesterday...
3051 2018-10-05 21:17:26 Ok but weren't we due for something like this?  I mean I was surprised to see select stocks fall today, but not surprised because the last couple of weeks have been gravy..right?
3052 2018-10-05 21:17:12 If you Dont stop spinning all that's been done differently is giving the top 1-5% and corps a chance to buy back stocks, bring back wealth they hide from the US. The regulations cut haven't affected none middle class people I help to find jobs daily who need 2/3 jobs to make it.
3053 2018-10-05 21:17:05 $ALT $5.30 alert today and hit $8.18 AH

3056 2018-10-05 21:13:10 Which business?  The “wealth management” LLC that has no website but he pretended to be part of to push stocks for 2 weeks?  Or his Korean food stand?  The Post gave him a few bucks to go away, he appears to be investing it wisely into failing political campaigns.

3061 2018-10-05 21:10:48 Ultimately @Tesla has never been about making profit out of their stocks. You've always been clear to the public about your vision for the future. So keep on being you, no one has accomplished what you have, especially with all the enemies you face.
3062 2018-10-05 21:10:37 I'm deep into WSTRF and UUUU (and 12 other U stocks). I was wondering about a pullback too. I think the reason why it's not correcting is the sheer lack of outstanding shares. Insiders own north of 25% ta boot.
3063 2018-10-05 21:10:27 solid!

3067 2018-10-05 21:06:46 Their stocks falling is possibly a result of their supportive tweets, which has proved to be a huge own goal for Juventus (pardon the pun).
And yes, he deserves full sentencing regardless of name.
3068 2018-10-05 21:05:34 sur les sites spécialisés dans ça ils commandent des gros stocks je pense que c'est différent, mais vrmt, l'import c'est vrmt cher c'est comme ça
3069 2018-10-05 21:05:31 Holy LOL the NRA does this all the time. “Any candidate voting for (background check legislation/banning bump stocks/whatevs) will lose our support” where support = $. I think it’s gross btw but unless you think the entire system is “corrupt af” you’re playing politics.
3070 2018-10-05 21:05:22 Tune in to @marketcall at 6pm et @BNNBloomberg. Will ask David Cockfield of Northland Wealth Management about the sell-off in US Treasuries that pushed yields higher & sent stocks tumbling + where we stand w/ Canadian equities now that we have a trade deal. #HappyThanksgiving 
3071 2018-10-05 21:05:22 Get out of stocks now!!!!
3072 2018-10-05 21:04:17 My goal trading is to make money of course but just like when I learned poker money isn’t going to clout my judgement.  Mastering my strategy comes first money is just the reward from consistency.

3083 2018-10-05 20:59:03 I’m sure that’s possible when invested properly penny stocks can provide good returns but there are very rare cases of a penny stock being successful long term. Then again nothing is assured when it comes to stocks

3086 2018-10-05 20:56:01  Why tf these stocks keep dropping
3087 2018-10-05 20:55:57 How much is the mkt down from its highs? Not much for blue chip indexes. The worst damage is in smaller stocks and techs, but even that is limited -- so far.

Index and decline from high:

Dow -1.9%
S&P 500 -1.9
Wilshire 5000 -2.1
S&P midcap -4.1
Nasdaq -4.2
Russell 2000 -6.3
3088 2018-10-05 20:55:11 I haven’t sold my stocks yet, because my loss on the Tesla stock, as of now, is not that high. I’ll wait a bit longer.
3089 2018-10-05 20:54:22 Stocks logged their worst day in months, while yields rose after the release of September jobs data (unemployment falling to a 48 year low of 3.7%). Market strategists suggest investors stay #bullish #SUACCF18

3095 2018-10-05 20:50:52 Ya, I don't even know who is writing them, but I've been making more trading options then trading stocks. 30%-120% gains have been common for me. Less money down and more money gained. Good luck

3098 2018-10-05 20:50:07 I didn't, but I had one stock significantly outperform all my other stocks and other holdings to the point where it now makes up a substantial portion of my savings.  I've never been able to figure out what to do about it.

3101 2018-10-05 20:49:33 Also a setback for environmental issues. For renewable Energy. Big Corporates with their stocks for 1% will be in power. But we ( Europe) will develop and invest in new energy. Black day for the world.
And also black day for justice. 
( FBI didn't hear #ChristineFord).
3102 2018-10-05 20:49:21 Largely depends on posn size and typical # of hldgs in portfolio. Fewer you have less it will act like an index, larger posns, quicker exits. If 20 or more could instead use index trend signal to toggle risk. Have u read 'Stocks On The Move' by Andreas Clenow? Good read/ideas.

3106 2018-10-05 20:45:44 I can't wait to hear 44 to make his speech saying how it was him that helped Kavanaugh get that final vote.
After all we owe him for fixing the country with North Korea, the low unemployment, record stocks highs, if not for 44 we would all be.. huh?

3115 2018-10-05 20:40:33 Yesterday the 10 yr yield was up 0.5bp.  CNBC kept saying the huge move in rates was causing stocks to collapse  (yes, I know about prior day bond move). Not everything needs to have a daily reason.
3116 2018-10-05 20:40:21 Don't you think stocks rally on rising yields, speaking for late cycle?
3117 2018-10-05 20:39:56 @jimcramer Days like yesterday and today are exactly why you tell us homegamers to take a little off the table when our stocks have meaningful gains. #Booyah #PigsGetSlaughtered #DontBeAPig
3118 2018-10-05 20:39:21 And it's part of preparing for No Deal anyway. as stocks go lower, they may start to nibble at them again. They want the prices to be as low as possible, and Brexit is serving them well.

3125 2018-10-05 20:35:44 Taiwan Stocks: Taiwanese stocks have got to be the most expensive in the world.   By my reckoning, if you total up the valuations of the TWSE, Taiwan's OTC, all of its ADR's and GDR's, we're talking well in excess of 3x Taiwan's GDP.  That's a recipe for disaster.

3129 2018-10-05 20:32:18 Everyone should be buying Beer related stocks. How about naming a new beer Kavanaugh? We already have Samuel Adams memorialized.
3130 2018-10-05 20:32:06 Note I am not claiming that the fairfax situation is the same, or that there aren't legitimate reasons to short tesla, I'm simply using it to show that
1. Misinformation is a thing.
2. It hurts stocks.
3. It is happening to tesla.
3131 2018-10-05 20:31:23 Not if stocks falling because of rising yields.... Though we're not quite seeing that yet...
3132 2018-10-05 20:30:55 Good to see ya Kev. Gonna miss you guys this year. I’m loving POTUS, my stocks are doing awesome right now. More money in my paycheck too. Hope all is well with ya out there. Kinda curious, you gonna watch the new season?
3133 2018-10-05 20:30:41 Also tech stocks knocking the market down today proves my point that tech stocks were propping things up. I said the only reason the market has done so well is tech stocks holding things up, and when they tumbled today, the market went with it, proving my point.

3168 2018-10-05 20:13:07 Why don't you figure out how your companies get shorted and scammed repeatedly, particularly the last three quarters.  What a great week for your company's stocks
3169 2018-10-05 20:12:39 Good ole George - if that's not market manipulation I don't know what is! Better hope the financing news hits by Wednesday or the stock will tank to low sub penny again! Well don'e George how to wipe out all the gains on one stock with one tweet! Nice one!

3175 2018-10-05 20:10:29 sorry been driving and trading from phone all day just got in front of screens 5 mins before close.
3176 2018-10-05 20:10:20 World stocks tumble again: Europe -.9%; US - .6%. Rising interest-rates & a still expensive market spurred selling. The last 2 days show the danger of short-term investing & trying to outguess the market. Still, it would not be surprising if market recovers by mid-week.
3177 2018-10-05 20:10:06 In some good news my guillotine stocks just skyrocketed
3178 2018-10-05 20:09:58 Popcorn stocks certainly went up during this past week.

3180 2018-10-05 20:08:50 Stock market - how does that translate to money to you today? lol Most Americans can't even afford to own stocks. The wealthy were given the biggest tax cuts & I don't see "jobs everywhere" However, I see you drank the kool-aid & I see how cult leaders do well in the US. Yikes!

Bullish.
3193 2018-10-05 20:00:54 Shorts increase liquidity in the market along with the volatility which attracts punters and makes stocks exciting to buy in the first place. Point is the trouble is with the Stock and its CEO not the way its traded. Or they would short everything!
3194 2018-10-05 19:59:20 Pensions and banks will. Question of when (likely vs carry trades for pensions, vs libor for banks).

Pensions should get lured in very soon imo, especially if stocks look shaky. 

Buy short dated bonds and ladder. Can always buy duration when shit hits the fan in 1-2 years. Easy
3195 2018-10-05 19:57:57 Stock market all over world  are weak .

US fedral bank is normalising balance sheet ,they are creating shortage of dollar 

All curtiencies are weak against dollar,stock market becoming less lucrative and FII selling stocks ,profit taking early in the year .
3196 2018-10-05 19:57:32 The only thing that changed is the RSI and weak hands are gone. Add a shot squeeze potential to that also

3202 2018-10-05 19:56:37 Couple weeks ago (per tweet) went to 40% cash again. Reason: dbl top on Dow. I try to let the market tell me when to sell. I don’t like double tops in markets / stocks. At all. With that being said I’ve done the same thing. We all have. #GoodFriday

3224 2018-10-05 19:45:55 I thought what was even more interesting--that they intend to put 60% of their 2019 assets into alternatives. That is an unusually large percentage--only 40% for stocks and bonds?

3226 2018-10-05 19:45:01 Transport #stocks are heading lower because of upward pressure on fuel costs brought about by higher #crude costs. Unemployment now at 48 year low which will place upward pressure on payrolls as well. Economy fundamentals still strong however.

3246 2018-10-05 19:38:21 Nope. Tech stocks have taking a beating. This has to do with industry coming back to the US and of course tax cuts and cut red tape. Obama said he was going to do something with NAFTA and never did, just didn't have stomach for it. North Korea starting to disband, China scared.

3263 2018-10-05 19:30:42 Not sure why the complete reversal today. Weird. Taking profits sure but we were near .04 today! Guess peeps will be missing out on the latest PR from the company today.

It’s grinding to a halt and I don’t like it. Charts are pointing to further declines and it just hasn’t happened yet. Stocks are getting pummeled

Guess what?  Bid's back to 0029. They just lost out 200-300% of their money.

Never use a market order on Penny stocks! Never

3301 2018-10-05 19:17:03 Yup, bonds are being propped up as the dollar is just slightly beginning to fall. Could easily turn out to be another failed prop, we'll have to wait until *Tuesday* (Fed gets a break, so stocks will probably pop Monday). Cheers Greg

3317 2018-10-05 19:09:11 Not sure I agree with all of it.  OTC retail did over $30 billion in 2017. If 99% of them lost money then that means 1% of OTC traders made all of that money. If true, why keep trading OTC stocks at all? More info is needed imo.
3318 2018-10-05 19:08:44 MASSIVE turn around in the stock market as the dollar weakens. Stocks, still down, but substantially off the lows. At the time I am writing this the DJIA down 162, was down 325 at the low when dollar was higher...

3430 2018-10-05 18:25:21 The world has gone mad.
US jobs growth is below expectations.
This should mean interest rate increases for the US are lower than would have been already factored into the prices, based on expectations.
As a result, European stocks fall?
Where’s the logic in that?

3441 2018-10-05 18:22:45 Hello 911? My stocks are down .5% and I’m freaking out.
3442 2018-10-05 18:22:38 It would be funny and ironic but a crude swoosh and stock rampathon would be another major FU … stocks ramp with and without crude as it sees fit.

3520 2018-10-05 17:53:24 I agree with you too Rob.  The problem remains that in the short-term, valuations for many $SPX & $QQQ stocks are just too high for a market that is pushing rates higher and the goal is to cool the economy, not stimulate it.  Stay conservative

3568 2018-10-05 17:37:36 Your 20/20 hindsight is so amazing.  Can you pick some stocks for me?
3569 2018-10-05 17:37:27 when you have bonds and stocks falling sharply, the risk parity boyz need to leave the boat before it sinks, and quickly

3571 2018-10-05 17:36:25 me treating myself = buying some stocks lmfao am i old yet?
3572 2018-10-05 17:35:59 I don't trade it, so I don't follow it closely. But I do know my approach works great on India stocks... we have many successful members in India.

3574 2018-10-05 17:34:50 Def gunna invest in some stocks but I gotta do some more research.. educate myself a bit more
3575 2018-10-05 17:34:27 Watch TNX at bottom of 2nd grouping on the list of stocks. This is the current yield on the 10 year note, presently at 3.242%, you have to move decimal 1 place to the left from what's quoted on the list
3576 2018-10-05 17:34:16 1998 is when the 2-10 curve inverted; that was the beginning of the end for that credit cycle; in the past it has taken about 18 months from inversion for things to catch on to stocks. Not sure it'll be that long this time around.
3577 2018-10-05 17:33:35 Polygraph testing is needed to believe you Mr. Trump, your a fake, a liar, too many people in tents on the street to believe the employment numbers, earnings don't justify the prices of stocks, might be a good time to sell, what is the next sector to fail, the truth will free you
3578 2018-10-05 17:33:31 My understanding is that the tax cuts are driving debt to new highs. This is driving bond rates to go higher, encouraging investors to move money from stocks to bonds. Look for Trump to start bragging about bond returns, I guess.
3579 2018-10-05 17:32:56 You are absolutely right...But one who invested after 61% crash made good money...So now many stocks are available at cheap valuation for good returns in future, waiting for further currection..,
3580 2018-10-05 17:32:36 DON'T PUT ALL YOUR EGGS IN ONE BASKET .. IF YOU LOSE .. YOU LOSE BIG. IT USUALLY HAPPENS TO THOSE WHO CONFINE TO A FEW STOCKS AS THEY DEPLOY THEIR CAPITAL IN ONLY THOSE NAMES. #MAKEorBREAK
3581 2018-10-05 17:32:01 Not much good to look forward to... Only a few stocks held this market up, and buybacks will not last

Tariffs, and high housing prices will hurt earnings, then another Fed hike

3585 2018-10-05 17:30:43 Well before this week the Nasdaq100 was up almost 20%, S&P500 9%, Dow 8.5%. When/if stocks are down 10-20% you’ll see a lagged response especially in high end consumption.

3590 2018-10-05 17:27:15 Bonds down, stocks down.  When does the risk parity chatter start?
3591 2018-10-05 17:27:13 People have been buying negative yielding bonds and selling gold mining stocks. 

Why?

Who knows. 

But you can never be sure when reason will return.
3592 2018-10-05 17:27:11 Not owning stocks is never risky, may make you less wealthy
3593 2018-10-05 17:27:11 It's pretty obvious you didn't own stocks then.. And you don't own stocks now. Keep watching tv though..
3594 2018-10-05 17:27:08 STOCKS:  Dow down 300 as interest rates soar..or is because of kavanaugh...USA not such a good place for other countries to invest...they don't like trump and the GOP
3595 2018-10-05 17:26:57 If you want to be the life of the party, start talking derivatives a penny stocks.
3596 2018-10-05 17:26:28 I’m amazed at how many stocks are down so much with so little panic. Everything feels like it’s in a slow bleed.
3597 2018-10-05 17:26:25 I talk "rules" all day long with VIP's.  Quickly, they "own" the rules. Love that. #stocks

3602 2018-10-05 17:24:58 Shorting literally prevents stocks from crashing. A short sell ends with a buy. 
And didn't you just try to take Tesla private several weeks ago, and the SEC shook you down because of it?
3603 2018-10-05 17:23:52 With the 5yr #Treasury now >3%, how much more of an increase in #yields will cause you to shift your portfolio from stocks to bonds?

3618 2018-10-05 17:19:22 STOCKS & BONDS:  Interest rates shooting up again as the value of US treasuries fall.  Trump and republican policies of borrow like crazy to give HUGE tax breaks to wealthy and stick it to the lenders, is not going over with countries that historically helped fund the deficit.

3626 2018-10-05 17:17:11 Blackrock has AUM of $6.3T, let's say 25% is in stocks/ETFs and it is loaned out. $1.57T loaned out generated $597M, that's 0.038%, hardly a big deal, Elon.
3627 2018-10-05 17:17:07 One lesson I learnt the hard way is that it's better to stay away from PSU stocks...Unless you can predict govt moves...Govt always finds a way to screw up somehow..The promoter is always more interested to satisfy voters than shareholders..
3628 2018-10-05 17:16:46 Not true. Stock markets and all human social systems are reflexive in nature and not deterministic. Bets on horses not comparable. Bets on stocks changes price of stock.

3630 2018-10-05 17:15:01 If you want fast turnaround then stocks is definitely not the way to go. Investing in stocks is more of a long term investment. Forex and Binary Options are much better options if you want faster returns.

3636 2018-10-05 17:13:08 I want to look for stocks that are holding up during the sell off.
3637 2018-10-05 17:12:55 if you listen real hard you can actually hear the GOP praying that stocks stay up.
3638 2018-10-05 17:12:36 Of the 32 stocks I own, 30 are down.  The two that are up? McDonald's and Equifax.  The only two companies that truly care for our nation.
3639 2018-10-05 17:12:22 Stocks falling, yields rising, crosses blasting, exotics crushed..
This does not bode well, does it.
3640 2018-10-05 17:12:03 If you have stocks it would be wise to protect that portfolio.
3641 2018-10-05 17:12:03 „All in“ sucks. Actually I’m losing my pension on TSLA ... is there any plan behind this „destructive“ communication? F.e. if number of shorted stocks is bigger than available freefloat ahead of Q3 numbers (...)?  pls surprise us! #backgroundbuyout

3645 2018-10-05 17:09:47 Looks more like their losing the competition. Site by site is closing down and their aint getting any new deal on either casino or the sportsbook.  RR with friends have allready sold alot of stocks.
3646 2018-10-05 17:09:46 I would advice you to change your stock picking. Wrong stocks to be consistent!
3647 2018-10-05 17:09:27 I’m in favor of bringing back stocks.
They would be appropriate for many of these politicians and staff members.
3648 2018-10-05 17:09:01 Elon tweets, Tesla stocks start fluctuating.
3649 2018-10-05 17:08:49 Shorts basically help subsidize the cost of buying stocks. We should thank them for their money
3650 2018-10-05 17:08:45 On taco Tuesday I bought 10 dollars worth @ChipotleTweets stocks. Should I have just used it to get tacos? Well I guess will find out this fiscal year
3651 2018-10-05 17:08:16 You obviously can prove to everyone the fax because they're there for everyone to see. The positive outcomes of people's 401 K and 403 b Plus stocks Etc have soared since President Trump has come into office. It's amazing what people will say even when proof is given to them
3652 2018-10-05 17:07:51 Stocks are down 1% today. Word on the street is George Soros is paying index fund investors & short-sellers to manipulate the market lower
3653 2018-10-05 17:07:41 I know... not yet

However, only a few stocks held up this market, and buybacks will not last
3654 2018-10-05 17:07:18 Me to markets: “I’ve seen this before, this isn’t real selling; we will bounce.”

3662 2018-10-05 17:02:11 I think valuation compression makes sense for securities that have benefited from low interest rates. I think the move in housing/auto stocks is overdone though.
3663 2018-10-05 17:01:28 Govt asks OMCs to bear RS.1 per lit of RS.2.5 reduction in oil prices.
Saves us.8000 cr. 
But ends up eroding more than Rs.30,000 cr of mkt.capitalisation of these companies.

Any logic?? 
Since OMCs are also govt.owned.

OMC stocks down 15-20% in minutes

Insider trading?
3664 2018-10-05 17:01:24 Anybody that has a 401k or a 403b or other means of having stocks Etc has seen an unbelievable positive surge in their income since President Trump took office. Bottom line President Trump has done more for our economy veterans farmers Etc than any other president has ever done.

3678 2018-10-05 16:57:24 Just remember when markets start to go down, most big funds will lighten up on stocks that have been big winners. Sit in cash and wait for better entry's.
3679 2018-10-05 16:57:14 where are the chat pics from? What room? I want to copy you and get rich too. You literally win 100% of the time. It's cool. I've lost last 4 days in a row using my own trade ideas lol. However, started trading the same stocks as you now (AAPL, BABA and FB) instead of 'gappers'
3680 2018-10-05 16:57:02 What I am saying... It looks and feels like one with all these stocks 10+ off their highs, and a bunch of negative happening

We also have the mid-terms, and another FED hike coming... If Yields invert, you will have a major selloff

3704 2018-10-05 16:48:49 Buyers/sellers and short sellers vote on stocks in much the same way that a gambler votes on a horse when they bet at the track. 

But don't confuse the bet for the race. While the race determines the outcome of the bet, the bet does not determine the outcome of the race.

Buy crypto.
Buy commodities. 

Short or sell stocks. Short and long timeframes are awful.

Make money, step 3.
Give back & make the world beautiful, step 4.

3734 2018-10-05 16:42:22 Just like i mentioned in one of my earlier tweets, it's a disastrous move. Over 1 lac cr market cap lost from these 4 PSU oil cos alone of which govt owns over 50%. Heavy loss to govt, its credibility n of course the tax payers. Will lead to complete derating of all psu stocks.

But too difficult for ppl to understand this when stocks are red down
3757 2018-10-05 16:36:24 People have to realize. @realDonaldTrump set everyone up for this. Remember in November. He gave you a false sense of security in stocks.

Owning stocks is risky in the short term

Not owning stocks is risky in the long term
3771 2018-10-05 16:32:39 When a long sells his/her stocks, he/she goes short. When a short buys the stock back, s/he goes long. The argument is, we are all participants either way just longing and shorting at different times.
3772 2018-10-05 16:32:23 That’s the biggest mistake you can make in investing. You only “lose money” once you sell your shares at a discount from what you bought them for.

If your looking for great returns:
Buy stocks in a number of great companies that you believe in, and hold them for the long term!

3776 2018-10-05 16:31:37 The bond market cracking is the new go to narrative to why equities are set to crash. Countless articles all pushing the same group think. Which is exactly what you want to see to set the next stage of what will be a monster rally in stocks.

3778 2018-10-05 16:30:19 Lol thanks for the advice. Made $1100 long so I'm still pretty happy and don't believe this is a worthy short. I'll never feel the risk is worth it for such low priced stocks, ESPECIALLY Biotech. I've been doing this awhile, no need to worry about me

2. Leveraged version of (1): 3x gains, 3x losses. Ticker: 3MEME
3. Inverse vol on index of stocks in MEME.
3793 2018-10-05 16:23:34 Read up on the theory of bubbles in the market.  Bubbles certainly end up causing harm.  Like when the $TSLA bubble pops a lot of people will be hurt.  IF only there were more short sellers to do the useful work of preventing bubble stocks.

3808 2018-10-05 16:18:23 You may wish to check fundamentals, like debt and rates. We are in a bubble. This won't be a correction. It's a bubble driven by a few select stocks to overvaluation and whopping debt. On a national level it will soon be unserviceable.

In terms of investing, instead looking for new stocks, spend more time evaluating, and vetting, those you already have - with a different perspective.

3816 2018-10-05 16:16:24 That is due to consolidation & M&A facilitated by #ZIRP & #QE - not due to short selling. Without short selling, Enron, Nortel & Sino Forest would still be around.

3817 2018-10-05 16:15:58 No one is in a better position to replace employees with robots, while using the opportunity to leverage higher labor costs for competitors. With bonuses and stocks phased out, this was a free PR/screw competitors move, and his huge numbers of 1099'ers got nothing. Priceless.
3818 2018-10-05 16:15:03 A well balanced portfolio should include:

1. Diversified Blue Chip Stocks. 

2. Real Estate. 

3. PRO Forex Traders with proven track records!

3822 2018-10-05 16:14:51 #Stocks and #bonds being dumped at the same time. #Yields up 3rd day - 10Y yield floor (rather than ceiling) going to be 3.25% once it punches through.
3823 2018-10-05 16:14:47 Surprised that there has not been a strong comment from @WhiteHouse  on the SuperMicro chip scandal. @realDonaldTrump has been hitting China hard on the matter of their intellectual property mischief.  I would stay away from ALL China stocks $BABA $HUYA $BILI $BIDU etc.

3826 2018-10-05 16:13:15 I always wonder if people are up there trading stocks or@managing their 401k or something.  I mean it takes like 10 seconds to get money so what are they doing?
3827 2018-10-05 16:12:35 Since tech stocks aren’t overly inflated, of course...
3828 2018-10-05 16:12:11 If this bond sell off doesn't slow down, stocks are going to get real Ugly fast....
3829 2018-10-05 16:11:47 According to the liquidity schools theory, rising rates & stocks selling off should be a double boost for the USD. But once again, this morning USD strength just isn't there. (as classical Austrian theory would predict)
3830 2018-10-05 16:11:46 It could be relevant since he picked Gottlieb. But what stock company even is Gottlieb? Like I didn’t know he even had stocks.

3832 2018-10-05 16:11:41 Don’t most high-yield stocks decline in an environment where interest rates are on the rise?
3833 2018-10-05 16:11:23 If we are talking stocks, then they invest in overvalued/hyped up companies to help them get their public valuation down to a fair and sometimes even a undervalued market price
3834 2018-10-05 16:11:13 #US Stocks: Homewares $NWL -5.7%. Auto $TSLA -5.6%. Casino $CZR -3.6%. Chemicals $EMN -4.6%. Ecom $SHOP -4.4%. SemiConductor $SGH +26.3%. Music Streaming $SPOT -3.4%. Wholesale $COST -4.0%. Health care $HSIC +2.1%. Lasers $IPGP -11.7%. Financial Svc $AMG -1.4% $WU -2.1%.

3844 2018-10-05 16:08:27 The #lds church owns 1.3 billion is pharmaceutical stocks. one of the companies that the #Mormon Church invested in, called AbbVie Inc., produces a drug called Marinol that contains a synthetic form of THC. No wonder they’re trying to shut down #Prop2 #medicalmarijuana
3845 2018-10-05 16:08:22 The trigger for all this selling (both stocks and bonds) was Fed members telling us that they don't know what the neutral rate is...and that they will be comfortable hiking until they find it.
3846 2018-10-05 16:08:11 Stocks sell off, bonds sell off. Apparently, there is an alternative.
3847 2018-10-05 16:07:42 Not going to happen yet imho. Dollar will crash but only to prop up stocks and bonds using stimulus on steroids.  Total collapse 2020/21. Garden variety 1987-type #crash of ~30% dead ahead, then #Fed and global CBs reverse policy.
3848 2018-10-05 16:07:38 Separately, the government also bolstered stocks through greater imports. The results followed, with arhar retailing at less than Rs 80 a kg currently.

Are China stocks dead?
3850 2018-10-05 16:07:22 Is there some software that allows you to find stocks and manage such a portfolio? Or are we talking old school here?
3851 2018-10-05 16:07:17 The government addressed this issue by announcing a string of administrative measures that record stocks built up through domestic procurement by offering significantly higher minimum support prices (MSP), as an incentive to wean farmers towards pulses ahead of other crops.

3855 2018-10-05 16:06:34 "The Bubble is in bonds and not stocks."  You can't make this shit up.  Those CNBC hosts and guests are too clueless to realize that all asset types have been priced using incredibly low bond yields as the valuation metric.
3856 2018-10-05 16:06:15 Could be a very interesting afternoon for markets. Bonds down + stocks down.

Treasury yields grinding higher -- 10-year up ~5 bps to almost 3.24%
S&P 500 grinding lower -- down 0.8% to 2,878
VIX -- almost at 17, highest since August
3857 2018-10-05 16:05:35 So you do acknowledge that Achche din were there when stocks were going up and rupee was strong, right? Don't worry they'll go up again, but you'll only go one way

3859 2018-10-05 16:04:59 The US #StockMarket hit All-Time highs despite record overvaluation because of the belief that the #Fed would backstop any decline. With #unemployment at a 50 year low, that belief is being questioned. With bonds selling due to expiring tax breaks, #stocks could be in trouble.
3860 2018-10-05 16:04:52 Looks like rates/yield story will weigh on stocks, so earnings season comes at key moment

3867 2018-10-05 16:03:00 For most of us. Current modern  thinking (and computers) allows to quickly build 30/50 stocks portfolio. (Also called as Momentum factors portfolio)
3868 2018-10-05 16:02:50 The Federal Trade should not raise on the interest rates , once you do they will be inflation and the stock market will tank #fact #stocks #economy #feds
3869 2018-10-05 16:02:45 Well, market transactions have both buyer and seller, so all markets are perfectly balanced. That's true if it's stocks or vehicles. If short-sellers of stock are value destroyers, then you, Sir, are a value destroyer for selling your cars. I don't believe either is true.
3870 2018-10-05 16:02:24 @9:00am PST. 10yr yield 3.23, dollar gaining strength. VERY stock market negative... without the "compensatory" effect which I outline all the time between the dollar and the 10yr, stocks are in trouble.

3874 2018-10-05 16:01:39 Long term investment loses its charm. The regulator should ban short selling of stocks. Raise Future & Options margin to 50% across stocks. Cut out the froth the builds up due to excesses. #Bse #NSE @arunjaitley #equity

3877 2018-10-05 16:00:26 Invest in MUTUAL FUNDS, not SINGLE STOCKS! omg people. The company could just release 1 bad product, or catch a random catastrophe and you'd lose ally our money in a single company. This Is Bad Investing And I Dont Feel Bad For Them! Also, Elon Musk is a douche on twitter.
3878 2018-10-05 16:00:18 Means nothing. What is the stocks true value? It was below €1 before we signed Ronaldo. It’s most likely worth less than €1 per share.

3897 2018-10-05 15:56:04 Do you own stocks? Because the bottom 80% of US households don't.  I do and it's great the stock market is doing well.  Aside from that we have horrific policy being made on all fronts and our country doing things that are horrible world wide.  Its bullshit that it's "thriving"
3898 2018-10-05 15:55:48 Growth stocks correct 2-3 times the market.... Great when going up; not so much on the way down. Gotta buy some puts?
3899 2018-10-05 15:55:36 Bond yields rising as stocks fall... a toxic combination.

3901 2018-10-05 15:55:20 Yeah it definitely creates opportunity to buy good stocks at a discounted price. But this is the kind of time when one should be very critical about all the companies and take long position only if the they pass all the filters.

3905 2018-10-05 15:54:47 That could make a nice salary for you to start shorting stocks from here onwards. Just tweeted about it :P
3906 2018-10-05 15:54:20 Very few of the jobs created are full time, or pay a living wage- same problem Obama had. 46% of working adults don't own stocks/can't afford them. Healthcare costs rising/deliberate undermining of ACA. Real wages FALLING b/c of inflation and tariffs.1/
3907 2018-10-05 15:54:11 Been saying repeatedly that ModiSarkar never cared about monitoring, the result is PNB scam, ILFS scam.

3912 2018-10-05 15:52:54 S&P 500 and other stocks are showing bearish divergence on weekly 

U$D is showing weakness 

Gold started showing strength

Do you think if stock market crashes, bitcoin as more volatile asset in portfolios will be liquidated first and result in huge drop like beginning of 2018?
3913 2018-10-05 15:52:39 Nike went up in stocks 17% since they starting burning they shit 
3914 2018-10-05 15:52:17 Every single conservative needs to do that too.  All of us need to deactivate our accounts and stay off of here. Do it for like a month and let Twitter’s stocks plummet. Maybe Mr. Democrat Twitter man would change a few things like employees.
3915 2018-10-05 15:51:12 The revisions to the prior months was pretty hot though. And some of the inflationary wage data apparently was pulled forward into October and will show up there. Too risky to own here. Although stocks just 2% from all time highs.

3917 2018-10-05 15:50:47 Not sure about Uranium and would not buy stocks as a proxy for the underlying commodity heading into a crash. Buy when stocks have crashed ~20% and just wait for the #Fed and global central bank policy reversal to stimulus on steroids imho

3945 2018-10-05 15:41:33 I fully agree. I hold the SEC accountable RegFD explicitly says equal access to news, yet the SEC has approved modified algorithms. And the sheer number of "leaks" of memos to boost or hurt stocks? No blue chip company does this, only vain CEOs.
3946 2018-10-05 15:40:53 Want to know your viewpoint on why you are betting these good stocks go down further ?
3947 2018-10-05 15:40:50 These are good stocks. Good for long run but not a right time to accumulate.

3949 2018-10-05 15:40:41 if u r doing sip dont stop now to see that its showing negative return or not performing, this is d best time to buy nav at lower level
most of gud stocks down & if u have any gud funda. picks then dont sold by showing negative return, its gudtime to avg at every lower level
3950 2018-10-05 15:40:33 See even I am a Indian cricket fan but you have to accept that we haven't played well overseas after the retirement of Sachin's dravids and sehwags. Bt wd this Indian team which has great fast bowling stocks I think we definitely can win overseas. And I think everyone knows that.

lower 1000 are small contractors, Oil & Gas, Gold & Silver, etc.

$RUS typically follows $TNA, not the commodity

$TNA follows $SPX, not oil & gold.

3959 2018-10-05 15:38:24 We should see sideways topping in the stocks until the inflationary pressures are priced in completely, probably one more high in wibter. The rotation and rebalancing from stocks to bonds will happen, the commodities will rally some. This is the peak for a cyclical bear market.

3962 2018-10-05 15:38:15 Bearish on both small caps and bonds.  Remaining Short both. Gun to my head more bearish bonds as there is no inflation hedge as there is in stocks.  Bonds are screaming for more Fed hikes.

3971 2018-10-05 15:36:29 @swingtrader28 $SPY I'm not guessing bottoms on any stocks in this market environment. Tight stops. This position was closed.
3972 2018-10-05 15:36:26 Scary... Seems like we are now in a Bear market with another Fed hike coming... Most stocks are like 10+ points off their highs
3973 2018-10-05 15:36:17 Yes. Nifty is having 20 overvalued stocks in addition to sensex 30 I guess. Was tracking Nifty TTM PE, it's at around 24.9 as of today closing. Still a decent amount above average
3974 2018-10-05 15:36:14 For the very short term, once this rotation in between the stocks and bonds ends, there should be a winter rally as the inflationary pressures built up. But from the investment point of view, the stocks will peak ahead of a recession, probably 6 months in advance in early 2019...

3995 2018-10-05 15:31:02 In the very short term for a few months, everything may go up from here b/c the inflationary pressures are building up. Then, everything should crash. So, I don’t see how the commodities will bubble up before the stocks go through a bear market and Fed starts pumping again...
3996 2018-10-05 15:30:49 I know little about stocks however from what I see on TV I find Musk to be irresponsible or at leat over dramatic. Keep reporting.

3998 2018-10-05 15:29:50 No one gets Treasurys are falling on supply and demand. Budget deficit running over $1T, QT adding $.6T, foreign liquidation possible also. Stocks and bonds falling together is as dangerous as it gets. Think risk parity and every RIA in America with their 60-40 models.
3999 2018-10-05 15:29:43 Most stocks are over 10% down off their highs... I think the Bear market has started

Once the Fed hikes again, the market is screwed, and inverted yield curve not long after

4002 2018-10-05 15:28:08 Bottom line? I'll repeat what I've been saying since market conditions began to change in Jan/Feb: This isn't the time to invest in high-risk, $$-losing #IPOs or high-multiple/overowned stocks you hear about 500 times/day. Focus on real-value names & hold a higher level of cash
4003 2018-10-05 15:27:40 Many of these US Operator CSE stocks are setting up their RTO/IPO dates right after midterm elections. You think Acerage doesn't know whats up? They have John Boehner as a board of director.  $TRUL.c, $IAN.c, $MPX.c, $MMEN.c, $TGIF.c, $GTII.c, $LHS.c

4005 2018-10-05 15:26:57 Cannot expect anything more than you. When they paid €100m for him they made an investment to have long term gains. The increase in stocks have to continue for a while for them to get returns on their investment.
4006 2018-10-05 15:26:55 False. These stats are based on a number of factors that hardly have anything to do with Trump but rather the result of the Obama administrations work. Also, high stocks don't equal booming economy when the wage gap is the worst in American history. This is why nobody trusts you.
4007 2018-10-05 15:26:44 U.S. stocks have been falling like a rock the last couple days.

4021 2018-10-05 15:24:18 There is too much invested - literally, in stocks and infrastructure and assets - and emotionally, in their identity, in their world view.

4025 2018-10-05 15:22:39 Stocks and bonds down together in a trade war? Risk parity will have to deleverage, if the dollar can't rally further, it would suggest foreign liquidation of US financial assets. This is as dangerous as it gets, not trading advice, simple observation.

4040 2018-10-05 15:20:16 Stocks sold b/c the long term rates are more attractive now. Inflation is building up in the short term, but I doubt it sustains in the long term, a recession is becoming unavoidable.

4052 2018-10-05 15:15:11 Universal background checks are a first step. I think we need to ban bump stocks to prevent semi automatic weapons from being converted to fully automatic. I think limiting magazine size would also help to reduce the death toll at Mass shootings. That is just a start...

4078 2018-10-05 15:08:04 Shorts should have to report just like Longs.  There's phantom shorts out there in some stocks well more than the float.
4079 2018-10-05 15:08:01 Stocks will rise notional loss will be overcome soon. Patience is the key.
4080 2018-10-05 15:07:41 Cash positions to buy when stocks are on sale? I was just thinking that I forgot to include that in my post.

4090 2018-10-05 15:05:58 I was asking your opinion. I know what they are. Some people just look at them differently. The term "growth stocks" is kind of arbitrary with no context.
4091 2018-10-05 15:05:41 Yes for sure, I'm talking about stocks which reached sl first. So we can check if this logic can be used with Algo Trading.

4101 2018-10-05 15:02:25 Mr. John Chen please address some of the short attacks by companies such as CIBC & Morgan Stanley.  Its getting hard & hard to support your company as there are continuous short attacks on your stocks.
4102 2018-10-05 15:02:20 Though Nifty may never see Feb-2016 levels ‘6825’ but 90% of the stocks will see such levels in next 30-60days, a good indicator of “VALUE” if stock is fundamentally good & poised for growth with INDIA moving towards 5Trillion by 2025. Happy investing. JAI HIND!
4103 2018-10-05 15:02:09 A 90kg bag of Dry Maize has never been this cheap for years. Many farmers are still holding onto last season’s stocks as this year's harvest season approaches. All the President could do was just to "warn" NCPB officials. Any action taken?
4104 2018-10-05 15:02:07 Yes elephants don't gallop. Yes small geared effect and then company specfics. Maybe the fact commodity stocks not powering ahead because global growth issues. Bond yields in us breaking out and trade tensions. Oil might come back down to correct divergence.
4105 2018-10-05 15:01:31 Interesting theoretical debate. From the perspective of middle class America the Obama years were a disaster (except for the stock market recovery...mostly driven by FANG stocks). No to slow growth, negative real savings interest rates, destruction of blue collar jobs...

4123 2018-10-05 14:53:05 I think you are trying to make a point. The shorts (and day traders) are trying to manipulate TSLA and many other stocks every day with unsubstantiated rumors and speculations. And no one seems to care. Correct?

4129 2018-10-05 14:51:19 @AOTtrades how did you learn to be so patient? I find it not easy to sit on hands when stocks are looking like a huge discount. On the other hand, it never works anyway. I always lose when I try to buy dips and outsmart the market
4130 2018-10-05 14:51:16 Sir the only problem is only few stocks are assets and not all stocks, if every stock went back to bull market high no one will be scared to buy the dips

4194 2018-10-05 14:36:25 Fact:   A good trend in a stock pays more than all the wiggles in the pattern.  Therefore, we must find patterns that can lead to "good trends."  Do you know them?   #stocks
4195 2018-10-05 14:36:03 So you can go for stocks with good #cashflow ,less debt or no debt, with less R & D expenses...I think #energy sectors #OMCs have been corrected a lot...so in #longer horizon you can reap the benefits . Go for #nifty index fund and message me for any doubt

4198 2018-10-05 14:35:36 220 tak. And it reverted, Rachit also said same thing. Saying anything and making cheap comment's is not expected from any person. Obviously if stock falls there would be some pullback buddy. Grow up

4200 2018-10-05 14:34:01 I’m heavily weighed in pot stocks ACBFF and CGC I totally agree
4201 2018-10-05 14:33:03 It’s odd. There are tons of stocks to trade and a good number of people are *obsessed* with this one. Why?
4202 2018-10-05 14:33:01 Trends pay best. So our job is to find chart patterns that can lead to good trends.

4203 2018-10-05 14:32:29 I will have to see fundamentals. Will revert you on these stocks by tomorrow then
4204 2018-10-05 14:32:05 I guess ya’ll should remember the freedom of speech amendment. No #sec no #youtube nor anybody should be able to interfere. #sec went rogue for pushing stocks up, now they will go crazy that @elonmusk hammers stocks down. Haha, and You don’t even recognize how funny this is!
4205 2018-10-05 14:31:51 Consumption is heavily reliant on asset prices (stocks) continuing higher as realized cap gains >100% of the annual chg in PCE. Higher rates likely hurt stocks & cools consumption, slow growth, etc.

4209 2018-10-05 14:31:20 Hi...I would suggest you to go for investing in #Nifty this time as the same has been corrected to an extent. #Nifty is basically a basket of top 50 companies of #india and returns of #nifty are always attractive in a longer run...#stocks are more volatile and need analysis

4213 2018-10-05 14:29:43 Tip - Sector Analysis Analysis of industries or economic sectors likely to exhibit superior performance. The health of a stock's sector is as important as the performance of the individual stock itself. The best stock located in a weak sector often performs poorly.

4221 2018-10-05 14:26:43 $TSLA The stocks can easily bounce back up to $375 considering how way ahead deliveries are. Elon’s tweets give us a buying opportunity.
4222 2018-10-05 14:26:37 What recession? Obama makes it worst on economy, he got paid from Auto industry, you think he do it for free. Obama is corrupt, he should be out in jail. Now, stocks up, unemployment down, economy strong and you should be thankful for that. Obama does nothing.
4223 2018-10-05 14:26:03 Y yall still buying chinese stocks lol
4224 2018-10-05 14:26:03 Perhaps - no argument there. I’ve shorted stocks before but I did so silently. I don’t think it was bad of me to see a valuation/biz  issue and short. But if shorts manufacture bullshit and manipulate stocks it’s just as criminal as if a long does it to pump.
4225 2018-10-05 14:26:02 Hey Mithilesh, don't worry, we would be having enough stocks for our fans. Stay tuned to Flipkart on 11th October 2018 as we can't ensure. Thanks

4228 2018-10-05 14:25:49 U.S. stocks opened flat on Friday after September jobs data showed further tightening in the U.S. labor market and moderate inflation pressures, doing little to deter predictions of gradual rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.

4231 2018-10-05 14:25:32 6 months can be short, but really with micro-stocks these days you can buy and sell day-to-day. But you have to cut your losses and let your profits run.
4232 2018-10-05 14:25:13 Could be at a turning point in the day. $WEED $CGC followed $SPY this AM, and $SPY has just broken it's downtrend. Pot stocks to follow suit?

4236 2018-10-05 14:22:55 Although I don’t like the negativity of shorters, they actually provide a support level due to covering and present a level for longs to enter. Otherwise, many stocks would just continue to crater.
4237 2018-10-05 14:22:46 He’s implying that there isn’t a need for tokenized stocks in the future. He’s asking why being his own custodian is better than having a 3rd party as it’s done now.
4238 2018-10-05 14:22:41 The market makers on this stock are quite something. No wonder institutions can do so well on these types of stocks, as MMs will oblige and take it wherever they need to. 18 to 5, and it can barely muster a 2/3p respite. News needed to stop the continued walk down. #EVRH

4242 2018-10-05 14:21:25 I hear you talk about "getting that back over the course of 6 months" isn't that a bit short? I mean I thought stocks were good for long term investments, so talking about such a short period of time surprises me.
4243 2018-10-05 14:21:00 Markets are falling like SmallCap stocks. After so much of downside why not keep a 2 percent circuit limit like they keep for a small cap.
4244 2018-10-05 14:20:51 Selection of stocks was good but hammering on Nifty was very hard,
4245 2018-10-05 14:19:48 $VTVT gave nice opprtunities today, missed them. To many stocks in play for me.

4247 2018-10-05 14:19:03 I guess that makes sense as the smaller Stocks should be a geared play on the Oil Price. I guess added complication is that #RDSB has big amount of Nat Gas exposure.

4249 2018-10-05 14:18:20 My stocks? Like 20 times a day, I do have auto-close on -5-% of the price I bought it for, as the chance of getting that back over the course of 6 months is about 30-40%. It’s really more of a fun learning experience to apply my study than anything else.
4250 2018-10-05 14:17:56 Forget about when the "market" bottoms... watch individual stocks. That's your main indicator... IF you're a stock trader.

4255 2018-10-05 14:16:32 That's odd, because I lost a lot of money in my retirement account after stocks fell because the employment numbers were so much weaker than anticipated.

4257 2018-10-05 14:15:56 I think a lot of these highly valued Stocks are getting hit at moment. With Buyers in general being scarce and People wanting more Cash, stuff like #FEVR easy to sell as it can be 'blamed' on Valuation and it's easy to take Profits.

4298 2018-10-05 14:02:37 Further, given the extraordinary risk of shorting (can only make what you invest, but can lose to infinity), there is a natural disincentive to short anything but the most overvalued or overhyped stocks.

Crypto is the last phase of our monetary evolution, but that won’t happen until 90% of shitcoins is gone and there is a winner-takes-all.

4381 2018-10-05 13:33:47 That's certainly an option. I prefer to short high flying stocks like AMZN and major indices and load up on bonds.

4383 2018-10-05 13:33:18 I personally hold a few dividend stocks and do like dividends due to the choice it gives and the tangible return. But I can see both sides of the argument, in the case of @FundsmithLLP the assumption is your good at stock picking like they are to get the compound returns.

4462 2018-10-05 13:05:51 Stocks should only go up
4463 2018-10-05 13:05:11 Sudden drops or rise of 20,30,40  actually makes it far easier to trade at a profit, unless you are trading incorrectly. Normal stocks are actually much harder to profit
4464 2018-10-05 13:04:19 If you want to tell the story of "equities have outperformed all the other asset classes" remember to say it weren't the same stocks that did that. Growth stocks come and go, don't just buy junk and expect to outperform, say, bonds. You best stock can turn into dust real quick.

4501 2018-10-05 12:50:40 #Nifty fell by 2.7% (282 points)- the single largest % & absolute fall since Nov 2016. But many Nifty stocks fell nearly 10 times the % fall - #HPCL (24%) & #BPCL (20%). No rate hike in today's #RBIPolicy & subsequent #Rupee depreciating to 74+ worsened the situation.

4509 2018-10-05 12:48:31 I guess depends on how many Stocks you hold and how mixed across sizes they are. It's difficult getting a nice Index to Short as F100 is weirdly weighted and US Indexes don't correlate like they used to. I'm using F250 which I think is nearer my Stocks really.
4510 2018-10-05 12:47:52 This isn’t to solve worries about “a run on stocks” I’ve never heard anyone concerned about such a thing and it doesn’t even make sense.
4511 2018-10-05 12:46:23 Such type of crash happens in 8-10yrs. But it has started from India. It will go upto 9500-9600 Nifty levels. But at such great prices for OMC companies, NBFC, and any good fundamental stocks, will come again in next decade. So accumulate great companies at throw way prices.
4512 2018-10-05 12:46:22 I wonder how the sector stocks up in size to say fishing and whether the disparity in coverage of such sectors has any justification?

This is for people who look to me for helpful advise

When volatility is high, you wd loose even if you are in the best stocks due to irrational markets

Buy PUTS ard 2% cost/month for next 6 months

Otherwise loose much more capital

4549 2018-10-05 12:34:23 Annnnd wage growth clocks in at 2.8% for Sept.-in line with expectations. Yield coming back a bit, stocks popping as it means wages aren't taking off and therefore inflation isn't either, keeping the Fed on its current policy course instead of getting more aggressive.
4550 2018-10-05 12:34:17 I'm pretty they say it as a defense mechanism, and don't tie it to any actual Constitutional right, seeing as the only Amendment that actually matters is the one the Founders specifically included to allow for bump stocks and high capacity automatic rifle magazines.

4585 2018-10-05 12:24:17 Apple stocks when it was $7
4586 2018-10-05 12:24:01 Agreed and 2009 to now has not been normal, however over time and I have seen my fair few crashes/corrections since I started in 1985 stocks have been a good place to be.
4587 2018-10-05 12:23:53 Certain stocks in indian market (part of sensex or nifty) available for 50% off . Apply the same strategy to pick stock, the one you use at garage sale...Pick the name brand at cheap price.
4588 2018-10-05 12:23:22 Yes, I did that in High School with some friends, we used newspapers to check stocks daily since there was no internet then. We started in October 1987, about a week before the crash. We had no idea what happened and we stopped playing pretty fast, too depressing.

4605 2018-10-05 12:15:13 The role of government is not to keep the market cap intact. Fiscal discipline is more important than the price of equity shares quoted by mad people on street. And these stocks are falling from the height which was gifted by none other than this govt.
4606 2018-10-05 12:14:47 Oh, good! You're starting to write some legislation to improve public safety. Do guns next, Ted. Write a bill that will restrict access to AR-15s, ban bump stocks, and protect people while still allowing hunters to hunt and people to protect themselves. It would save lives!

4627 2018-10-05 12:05:43 This analogy of calling bear market as discount sale does not excite people because stocks are assets and not consumables. When goods fall in price, everyone is happy. When asset price falls, none is happy. I’m not saying this approach is right but this is how people see it.

4697 2018-10-05 11:29:18 market is headed for a significant decline is the divergences between the few large-cap stocks that are rising (and thereby propelling the market averages higher) and the vast majority of other stocks that are not. Divergences spell imminent trouble

4704 2018-10-05 11:24:58 There exists a chance Monday many investor favourite cash stocks will be down 5-10-20-50% by 12pm. Watch out .
4705 2018-10-05 11:24:00 Amazon employees starting at $15 minimal wage is utter bs because it completely screws everyone already making more than that. No raise for us, they’re taking our stocks and our monthly bonus away. To make the employees who can barely fog up a mirror happy.
4706 2018-10-05 11:23:50 This guy is the #Karlmarx of CEOs. If he focused on more on @Tesla, he shouldn’t have to worry about short sellers. I’ve never seen @satyanadella, @JeffBezos or @sundarpichai whining about this, they just focus on their job and their companies stocks price speak for themselves.
4707 2018-10-05 11:23:40 Not in comparison to the rest of the world!!! The you clearly know nothing about business, investor confidence, ect!!! People are willing to invest in US stocks because they are confident that the markets will remain free!!! Go back to school genius!!!

Similarly for the major currencies and #oil. And all this while awaiting the #jobs report.
4711 2018-10-05 11:22:10 It’s a learning to be in a bull/ bear market. To see your stocks/ portfolio go up/ crash. The market is supreme. Embrace it. Stop suffering. It’s part and parcel of being in the market. Being humble! #stocks #trading #investing

4773 2018-10-05 10:49:38 Fundamentals cause stock moves. TA tracks institutional buying/selling. Pro buying is very similar across a diverse group of stocks and their tracks will show up when they enter a stock. Whether a fund buys BKNG, CCO or AMZN, the actual execution process is similar.

4887 2018-10-05 09:39:42 Very good for analysis and concentration, but maybe too picky when deciding what to buy. Better for you to concentrate only on a few things and do it well rather that too many scatter things. Stocks related to health, pharmaceutical, human services.

4889 2018-10-05 09:38:10 @ETMarkets : is it the right time to buy more stocks...as they r plunging down in these times...so as to  gain more..once sensex..starts upwards trending
4890 2018-10-05 09:38:10 Yup, though it is also true that the more buy and hold of an investor one is the more one should focus on quality and the less price matters, while deep value guys like myself who gravitate toward cyclicality need to switch stocks more often.
4891 2018-10-05 09:37:47 actually, only stocks on an approved list can be shorted in Australia, the brokerage is a lot more expensive, and brokers tend to deter short selling.

4941 2018-10-05 09:07:07 You’re “assuming” the market is positive sum, and there’s a way to predict coin flips.

5090 2018-10-05 07:18:00 We curate stocks into thematic portfolios - but essentially you're buying a basket of stocks (not units of a smallcase, like in the case of mutual funds), that can be tracked & managed effortlessly in the form of smallcases.
5091 2018-10-05 07:17:46 After yesterday's long overdue healthy correction in stocks and bottom in the bear market, hopefully this is a start of a new bull market and we hit new record highs 
5092 2018-10-05 07:16:22 it means that this thematic investments are only your idea and you buy stocks as I do or it is like units as in mutual funds.

5095 2018-10-05 07:15:44 By banning bump stocks the government will make the penalty for having a shitty fake rapid fire gun the same as manufacturing real machine guns (which is easy asf). 

Thus making bump stocks obsolete because for the risk, who wouldn't just make a real machine gun?
5096 2018-10-05 07:15:12 Only 16% of Americans own personally held stocks, so ... who cares?
5097 2018-10-05 07:13:41 Hi Apurva! All stocks you buy through smallcases are credited to your demat account. So should something like this happen, you would still have full ownership and control over the stocks you have invested in.

5099 2018-10-05 07:13:22 That makes sense, but is it really safe to assume that stocks are in fact Brownian motion with positive drift? I’ll also add that if your investments go to zero, they don’t come back...

Well, besides 
- giving a tax cut to the top 1%, 
- dropping regulations, which protected the environment,
- enforcing tariffs on raw materials like steel and aluminum, forcing comanies to increase their stocks ahead?
5103 2018-10-05 07:09:47 Why are the funds suffering a net loss? I own a BlackRock ETF and I chose it BECAUSE they lend the stocks to shortsellers. For me it just makes the product cheaper and doesnt effect me in any other way. I know that BlackRock is earning money from this.

5161 2018-10-05 06:40:29 Good list. Some points on #3 and #5 though: There are tons of cyclical stocks in a downturn right now. Also, a lesson from Howard Marks is to always focus on price first. Many "defensive" stocks that pay dividends aren't that defensive because the bond investors have rushed in.
5162 2018-10-05 06:40:13 We have 3 inflated financial markets:
1) stocks
2) bonds
3) USD
I see them coming off in turn as follows:
A) stocks down, bonds up, USD up
B) stocks remain down, bonds down, USD flat
C) stocks rise some, bonds remain down, USD down
We take a big bath and start all over.

5182 2018-10-05 06:29:08 The market has been shaken by the rapid rise in Treasury yields and are still balancing the question of why is this negative for stocks! The global capital flow has been towards the USA for a while now and rising rates will only accelerate that demand.
5183 2018-10-05 06:28:57 I'm from EU and can't buy $ALEAF before (if) it goes on Nasdaq. I can, however, buy $ALEF. Is there a difference between the two besides daily volumen? Can the two stocks have different daily climbs, like say 1% and 10% respectively?
5184 2018-10-05 06:28:16 How we can check that, is there any history of stocks managed under fund?

5186 2018-10-05 06:27:49 Ok, I asked that same thing on my FB page. I got "stocks are down & employment is up". That was all anyone could come up with. Seriously? I think  "weaning out the violent & idiot Americans ( trump faithful)" is all he acomplished thus far 
5187 2018-10-05 06:27:19 This isn’t even the real correction in Indian stocks. The day those chaddi banyaan cos correct 20% , that will be interesting. They sell probably only to 2% of total population but valued as highest quality stocks. Coz fiis n media want them to. #nifty #investments

5189 2018-10-05 06:26:27 Trend is changing so quickly. 2 Months before, most of the stocks are trading at 52 Wk High. Now almost as per your stats, almost 60% of stocks are at 52 Wk Low.
5190 2018-10-05 06:26:15 It's already kind of crowded, but if you want to do stats then some kind of ticker type thing ala stocks or racing would probably be better than mouse lovers. I watch probably 50% of my sc2 in bed

5200 2018-10-05 06:20:55 Asian stocks rounded out a tough week with a further sell-off Friday as technology companies in the region were roiled by escalating concerns about their business in the #US! 10y #Treasury yields held near seven-year highs before the American payrolls report!
5201 2018-10-05 06:20:45 #Markets 

But gains were capped by a sharp rise in US treasury yields, which underpinned the dollar and weighed on stocks.

5207 2018-10-05 06:14:52 The government has been smart to launch #Nifty #CPSE #ETF and dump #PSU stocks to retail at at least 50 percent higher. Those with this ETF would have lost at least 30 percent of their portfolio value. This is significant because these investors would be relatively risk averse.

5209 2018-10-05 06:06:50 my suspicion is that most of these people are exaggerating/lying. if you’re sophisticated enough to invest in individual stocks in equity markets, you’re probably sophisticated enough to know that investing your *savings* into a single company is stupid.
5210 2018-10-05 06:05:22 By 11 am, the S&P BSE Sensex had touched a day's low of 34,760.57 and the Nifty50 of 10,445.10. Thirty-one out of 50 Nifty stocks traded with losses.

5212 2018-10-05 06:04:30 Shares dipped in Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea while Australian stocks bucked the trend. The 10-year Treasury yield stabilized around 3.20 percent after hitting the highest since 2011 this week and S&P 500 futures ticked higher.
5213 2018-10-05 06:04:22 Asian stocks rounded out a tough week with modest declines amid some signs of market stabilization following this week’s surge in bond yields. Treasuries steadied and the dollar held gains for the week as traders turned their focus to U.S. employment data Friday.

Every body now invisible

5230 2018-10-05 05:57:02 Markets Find a Reason : HPCL and BPCL are perfect examples of that. You can blame this fall on petrol price reduction or whatever, but the truth is that these were much overvalued and had to fall. This will play out in many other stocks.
5231 2018-10-05 05:56:21 That’s not universally true. The ones that are unhappy are the ones that are invested, those waiting in the sidelines for an entry point are rubbing their hands in glee. Also in any market people are unhappy when stuff you bought for a higher price is available cheaper! #stocks

5243 2018-10-05 05:39:23 Allocation of investments depends heavily on your financial plan. You'd need to lay out all your goals, break them down to what you need to set aside today, then allocate.

5254 2018-10-05 05:31:58 Certainly the charts suggest this presently & we need to trade accordingly. However the macro environment is becoming very interesting.

I don't just want to save for retirement, I want to build and create wealth for future me and my generations
5262 2018-10-05 05:27:28 All stocks trade on future earnings, even the ones making a lot of money right now. For example, let's say there was a new restaurant chain with 10 restaurants. Let's say that each restaurant makes around $500,000 a year. That stock will be valued on  future plans of expansion.

Once pot stocks find support they should settle for a bit then rise on news or ER

$AMD - should continue to pull back. That run was insane imo.

$SBUX - could cool then push to $60.

5279 2018-10-05 05:20:34 That's what I'm wondering too. They still own the same amount of Tesla, it's just worth less. As long as they don't panic sell they haven't lost shit. Unless they think of stocks as short-term investments and are in critical need of cash right now, which is ofc irresponsible.
5280 2018-10-05 05:19:56 In general, I do prefer buying stocks where the company is already making money. But often the stocks with the most upside are companies that are still losing money. TSLA is one quarter away from being profitable. I work for a hedge fund. We get all the analysts' estimates.

5306 2018-10-05 05:01:40 His later tweets on passive funds lending out shares regardless whether it will destroy value are sound. Hope he’s talking to some large pension funds to do sth about it. If Calpers bars its long only managers to lend out stocks, it’ll be great news. Can u ask Calpers to comment?

5308 2018-10-05 04:58:00 “Stocks will fluctuate substantially in value. For a true investor, the only significant meaning of price fluctuations is that they offer … an opportunity to buy wisely when prices fall sharply and to sell wisely when they advance a great deal.” - Ben Graham

5310 2018-10-05 04:55:47 RT @charliebilello: Yes -3% would be the worst year ever (data back to 1976). What bonds lose in their worst year stocks can lose in a day 
Sí, el -3% sería el peor año de la historia (datos de 1976). Lo que los bonos pierden en sus peores acciones del año pueden perder en un día

5313 2018-10-05 04:54:53 We all know there is inflation, sherlock.   Dude, you didn't predict the sell off. Market going down bc everyone happen to be shorting. @cnbc is the culprit with massive Tariff & headline. Plus stocks r overbot. Only @MadMoneyOnCNBC is good on that show. ;)
5314 2018-10-05 04:54:23 Please do not use the word subsidy in the context of oil pricing as you have been selling at a higher price - courtesy almost 50% of taxes ( center + state ). Your suggestion seems the good one looking at the mayhem in OMC stocks.
5315 2018-10-05 04:54:03 Both BJP & Congress are together in this market meltdown.
The loss is for traders caught on the wrong day,

5317 2018-10-05 04:53:30 Yield to maturity (YTM) is total return anticipated on bond if bond is held til maturity.  10-YR TSY YTM is 3.193%. To be indifferent between bonds & stocks, expected equity total return would have to be 6.2% - 8.2% annually assuming ERM of 3%-5%. I know which is more certain.
5318 2018-10-05 04:53:11 Its all panic only. you want to say if 7000 crore extra dividend was collected from OMC than market would have not panicked & punished stocks ?
5319 2018-10-05 04:52:44 Its a very incredible news of the stock Market. By the increasing sentiments of the stock market there is a rally in the stock price which penetrates a buying and selling tendency of the stocks. And there would be boom and decline in the stocks prices. And by the phased..

5325 2018-10-05 04:51:49 People put too much emphasis on a company's value based on stock price. Stock fluctuations often have nothing to do with companies; raise the capital gains tax and the price of stocks will drop. Nothing to do with the companies themselves.

5331 2018-10-05 04:49:35 We agree w/ @elonmusk that short selling stocks is a tumor of the stock market. Program trading is another one. We have forgotten why stocks were created at the beginning. They have become pure money-making symbols of market participant instead of helping real businesses to grow.

5354 2018-10-05 04:33:27 Should not invest money that is needed for at least 2 years.

Stocks sometimes go to unbelievably lower levels. don't get panic.

Don't buy stocks with greed that are not suitable for your risk profile.

Patiently accumulate best opportunities - not your current holdings (EGO)
5355 2018-10-05 04:33:26 Stocks are driven by earnings. . 2.5rs/Litre margins are now cut to 1.5rs/litre. . Demand isnt going to rise by 40% in near term to hedge margin pressure. .
5356 2018-10-05 04:30:50 Higher #MSP for crops means that farmers have higher income which is good for #FMCG cos

This means higher input costs for FMCG cos which dampens margins but volumes increase due to higher consumption

5361 2018-10-05 04:27:59 Why should OMC stocks be hit if the realisations of OMC are intact? Tax cuts are normal. In fact reduced petrol prices may encourage consumption and thus help OMCs do even better. That's normal free-market behaviour and consumer surplus situation.

5423 2018-10-05 03:48:36 I see tax cuts and federal deregulation. I don't see any new wars and see a concession of Syria to Russia. I don't see any major new Government programs like Obamacare; instead I see an attempt to roll Obamacare back. He wants to ban bump stocks. His tariffs on China are bad.

5426 2018-10-05 03:44:49 @BMTheEquityDesk Sir you mentioned in your book when bull market is at peak even barbers and kiranawalas start recommending stocks.. In bear markets what is the hint to start buying and what are these guys generally discussing as we near the bottom?, Jst a humor query! #TGIF 
5427 2018-10-05 03:43:08 Never trust a car salesman they say, but the same is true for stocks, which you still seem to be selling here.
So what are you?
A car salesman or.. oh wait, you're both!
5428 2018-10-05 03:42:16 What should bears do if Nifty breaks 10500 ?

Just trail support to 10620 and if it breaks 10400, trail to 10500.

Till the time we r below 10750-780, trend is weak

5430 2018-10-05 03:39:24 @p_rishi_2000 - my personal opinion is that MFs are junk ..........
easier to buy index funds/ETF or buy stocks directly........

The money being pumped in may fade away to these avenues and that would be a GOOD thing!
5431 2018-10-05 03:38:33 Short interest in stocks is a great barometer to gauge if a stock is worth buying...shorts will almost always have to buy the stock back at some point ...they are creating more demand by shorting...should the SEC also outlaw buying Puts?
5432 2018-10-05 03:37:54 I agree that the economic impact is nominal. But the fiction of PSU stocks being run for the benefit of shareholders is clearly visible now. Any investor who was foolish enough to trust government to care about them knows better. And given the size of the public sector, it's bad.

5444 2018-10-05 03:30:24 The early 90s:

@realDonaldTrump, the grifter, claimed he had $210M in cash and stocks, but when the Philadelphia Inquirer dug a little deeper, it discovered that Trump had borrowed $190M from a dozen banks, and was struggling to service $3.5B of debt.
5445 2018-10-05 03:29:48 In 2016 the top 10% of American households, as defined by total wealth, owned 84% of all stocks, and that % just increased under the new tax plan, allowing corporations to run amok with stock buybacks.

5447 2018-10-05 03:28:55 & how many minutes of silence for those in non sarkari stocks. Are they creating new highs. How a biased mind can twist the news, select pieces to suit his own rhetoric. You can sell all ur holdings in the stock market and invest in vadra's company and rake in the profits
5448 2018-10-05 03:28:31 The Indian market remains in a Downtrend. On Thursday, FIIs were net sellers as they dumped stocks worth Rs 2,760.63 crore. DIIs were net buyers as they purchased stocks worth Rs 1,823.59 crore.
5449 2018-10-05 03:28:17 I think shorting stocks should be illegal: shouldn’t we support American companies? By betting against them, we are incentivizing failure. If you feel like a company will fail, just don’t invest. Why short???

5459 2018-10-05 03:23:19 PSUs are always on a five year cycle; they are high downside beta stocks in the pre election year as the government uses them to absorb fiscal profligacy followed by high yield and bounce back in the next couple of years.
5460 2018-10-05 03:23:03 And what would u call endless Jhumlas done by so called experts/stock analysts talking non sense about stocks & mkt when they also know they have no clue where mkt will go or how stock will do ..
5461 2018-10-05 03:22:49 Damn right. I've never seen Zuckerberg, Bezos, or Cook (or Jobs) malign shorts despite being heavily shorted stocks. They execute relentlessly and prove the shorts wrong with actions, not tweets. And through their actions, their shareholders have been rewarded handsomely.
5462 2018-10-05 03:22:49 There is about a 4 week window in which things are working for or against the stocks added or removed respectively, while funds are adding or selling. After that SP are back to normal!

5527 2018-10-05 02:43:08 Theoretical example on how BTC price predictions impact the market. 

Mike Novogratz says Bitcoin to $40/45k in November 2017 --> Retailers HODL at $20k Jan 2018, smart money sells.

Now says Bitcoin won't break $9k by end of 2018 --> Retailers sell at $9k, smart money stocks up.
5528 2018-10-05 02:43:04 Unfortunately, this part is very true in fact I think in some cases they hold stocks up from total collapse (think $MDXG) just so they can recoup some losses thru high borrow rates because if they did unload the stock would get hammered and they would have nothing to offset.

A lot of their stuff has been proven to be fake also. They also went on rant saying they didn’t believe UGR had any TT carslol

5546 2018-10-05 02:32:53 You don't buy uranium stocks so they become producers etc.Espacilly uranium. Rarely a company goes into production in a cycle. When you only have 30 odd companies in the sector, it time to back up the truck and go bananas.

5549 2018-10-05 02:30:49 In regards to my position size.. I go by what each tick yields. If I see only .10¢ upside, I’ll take a position size that will yield a better return based on the probable movement. It can backfire; especially with sub $1.00 stocks, but cutting it when things go south is key.
5550 2018-10-05 02:29:54 Shorting high beta stocks with tight stoploss ?
5551 2018-10-05 02:28:38 Hmm...yeah I guess when u start that's perfect.. it's just that SL saves a lot of heartburn.. when stocks tumble.. I've been there many times.. and SL helps us to judge if the risk is worth it,if it's a poor entry point
5552 2018-10-05 02:27:49 if you care so much about cube, i would of love to see you vote for pentagon or idle since you care so much about their stocks dropping
5553 2018-10-05 02:27:47 I’m not perfect i admit that. But I’ve never mislead people on stocks or Hyped something that i didn’t 100% believe in. How some scum bags can go & fuck people over smile and make $ off it absolutely baffles me. I wont get rich quick but I’ll do it  my pride & character intact
5554 2018-10-05 02:27:21 Fellow universe. Please don't joke about cubes stocks. Peoples jobs are on the line that had nothing to do with it.

5555 2018-10-05 02:27:16 Great read BB, I've not paid enough attention to progressive divi stocks vs more established high income stocks so interested in your strategy here, reduction in my % of £'s allocated to high income stocks has driven stronger returns so far TY
5556 2018-10-05 02:27:05 We are in bear market from January.... When is the perfect time to invest? I firmly believe one blowout phase of crude is remaining(may be 100-120 dollars)... Whenever crude comes above 120 dollars then it will be perfect time to buy stocks at throw away valuations.

5562 2018-10-05 02:23:57 @elonmusk  Focus on bigger picture, or your burn out mate, your open to natural market forces, short sellers only pick stocks with news driven themes as that creates crowd psychology, momentum leads to cash, any real trader wouldn't short this as price structure isn't favorable
5563 2018-10-05 02:22:49 me: h-
non fans: cubes stocks are dropping
5564 2018-10-05 02:22:14 So what stocks are doing really well rn? What should I invest in? #helpmeout
5565 2018-10-05 02:21:54 He might be dragged out of hiding by irate women and put in stocks on the National Mall where they'll spit on him all day long.
5566 2018-10-05 02:21:21 Most of the stocks are below the 200 dma? hmm yeah idk about that one lol
5567 2018-10-05 02:20:15 Hmm..just a thought..if u know ur SL when u enter a trade, and put tht SL as soon as u enter, I think you will do great considering your discipline/risk management. This wud also help in situations where stocks tumble in a matter of minutes or seconds..
5568 2018-10-05 02:19:34 I've never seen it this extreme with other stocks. Just the ParkingLotTruthers story is enough to demonstrate how this stuff makes its way into national platforms.  Though tbh, it could just be a symptom of how polarized this country has become. "Must destroy the other team'.
5569 2018-10-05 02:17:14 At the Good Oil Conference the journalist's were all over this company like a rash  it was the darling of the companies and got hold of their imagination pretty quick as it looked to them like an environmentally friendly alternative compared with dirty oil and gas stocks Oh Dear

5571 2018-10-05 02:15:52 y'all keep checking cube's stocks, saying cube is cancelled, and tweeting the same tired jokes, but where was all this energy when we were streaming naughty boy? when we were voting? hm.

5573 2018-10-05 02:15:10 the fellas gassing me up in the gm but my stocks dropped today.. very conflicted
5574 2018-10-05 02:14:43 I wished I caught the weed stock run but at least my other stocks are killing it. Crypto has been a snooze.
5575 2018-10-05 02:14:40 brace yourselves, kpop stan twt will be clowning cube's stocks again
5576 2018-10-05 02:14:28 but which stocks to choose.....very easy as .....two strong trusted n reliable mgmt stocks....with good growth n innovation prospects....LTI n LTTS....with the added advantage of low equity, high promoters holding, strong Balance Sheet.
5577 2018-10-05 02:14:16 Rising crude,Int. rates affects majority of sectors...with LS elections funds too exit in a big way....IT, Pharma n some FMCG stocks had seen remaining firm in these circumstances in past.....so applying previous experience n observations.....decided to churn all holdings into IT
5578 2018-10-05 02:14:08 Always choose ignored sectors & pick the best 2-3 stocks in that sector,once the market recognised u can sell/exit.(but avoid cyclical)

Exactly 1 year back IT sector was completely ignored, see the returns of TCS,INFY,LTI,LTTS etc., 

Now few sectors ignored...

5579 2018-10-05 02:13:23 Its not official yeT but we watch cube's stocks go down as we speak
5580 2018-10-05 02:13:14 Never claim vitroy too soon, especially on stock market. China's stock market today can be a mirror for U.S. Stocks: Self-trampling among citizens and distrust of government will lead to the hangover and headache after stock market 's skyrocketing.
5581 2018-10-05 02:11:45 Not just MF's, so many good stocks are also available at cheaper price. Time to invest

5583 2018-10-05 02:11:18 Тогда хорошо. Тогда можно хоть и во все stocks вкладывать. За 10 лет есть время, что если рынок обвалится, то у него будут шансы восстановиться.

5587 2018-10-05 02:09:17 Yea man it sucks..I’m super cold all the time due to terrible blood circulation issues. Injury from the military  fucking sucks.
5588 2018-10-05 02:08:39 U.S. Market Check

    U.S. stocks fell the most since June and volatility spiked higher as the rout in Treasuries that took yields to multiyear highs fueled a repricing of risk assets.
5589 2018-10-05 02:08:25 its so wild to me because this is their livelihood and everything they've worked hard for on the line and non unis are ㅋㅋㅋing over the stocks dropping.
5590 2018-10-05 02:07:47 Asian stocks rounded out a tough week with further declines after  U.S. equities fell to a three-week low amid the surge in bond yields.

Shares in Japan and Australia declined and futures indicated losses when trading begins in Hong Kong.
5591 2018-10-05 02:07:12 Financial sector keeping the asx afloat,with 47% of asx200 as financial stocks. Give it some more time. Last few bulls still holding on which will be futile.
5592 2018-10-05 02:07:04 Watch their stocks fall once again.
5593 2018-10-05 02:07:02 The index funds themselves loan out underlying stocks to earn money for index fund shareholders and improve fund performance.
5594 2018-10-05 02:06:01 I mean yeah.. I hope you also bought leaps on less risky stocks such as AAPL or ALGN. Hope you didn’t put most of your money on the TSLA calls... long term it’ll go up but short term is a gamble with all the FUD spreaders out there.
5595 2018-10-05 02:05:26 @NasdaqCrypto Can you help me gain followers? RT? I provide trade advice and share what are the hot stocks to watch!

watch cube's stocks plummet again
5599 2018-10-05 02:03:22 I'm sad for pentagon but I'm really glad that both of them decided to leave cube after knowing that cube kicked them out and tried to keep them when they notice their stocks decreased..
5600 2018-10-05 02:02:42 pyramid better pray for their stocks
5601 2018-10-05 02:02:13 You guys are nuts...this is delusional

This is not how one treats a regulator who cuts a criminal operator a sweet deal

their case was in no way frivolous but @elonmusk’s harping on abt shorts is

If u knew anything you’d know stocks got down faster when they are not shortable
5602 2018-10-05 02:02:01 It is a proprietary have VectorVest broad market composite stock index. You cannot use it unless you were VectorVest member. It tracks roughly 8000 US stocks.
5603 2018-10-05 02:02:00 its weird to me how when rumors spread around about hyojong and hyuna spread around and the first thing people do is google cube’s stocks
5604 2018-10-05 02:01:54 A thread of me watching Cubes stocks fall after losing Hyuna and E'Dawn- warning: you may laugh at how dumb Cube is
5605 2018-10-05 01:59:34 What is bizarre about this flurry of @elonmusk tweets about short sellers is $TSLA was down today because the market was down, and it was down less than other stocks. 

So either he’s not aware of the broader market or this is about something worse for the company that is coming.
5606 2018-10-05 01:58:58 Sigh. This whole come-on is why I avoid their entire site. I listen to all their podcasts though. 'Here are 10 stocks we like more than whatever you're looking at and which we didn't demarc as an ad". No. Bye.

5610 2018-10-05 01:57:13 Eating these funko stocks crazy
5611 2018-10-05 01:57:01 Its a fair comment Gass. Applicable to anyone on Twitter discussing Stocks.
Without showing Real Buys & Sells You could just be an Avatar spruiking for others or gaining Publicity.
5612 2018-10-05 01:56:44 kiss goodbye to Cube's stocks
5613 2018-10-05 01:56:34 If your fund manager invested in software stocks in 1999 or Infrastructure stocks in 2007 or NBFC’s in 2018 then you need to change fund manager. If you are the fund manager then you need to change your profession!
5614 2018-10-05 01:55:58 who would even want to stay in a company that kicks you out over a relationship then change the decision after seeing the impact on their stocks lol NO ONE
5615 2018-10-05 01:55:08 It's midday in America and stocks are tanking.  U.S. stocks fell the most since mid-August as U.S. Treasury yields hit 3.20%, the most in 7 years. All major benchmarks fell at least 1%.
5616 2018-10-05 01:54:59 If I learn how to fw stocks it’s a wrap
5617 2018-10-05 01:54:45 What that man's done to this country - OMG, it's a beautiful sight to see. Jobs, business, low unemployment in all categories, rising stocks, high GDP... the list goes on & on. My God, we were truly blessed to get @POTUS @realDonaldTrump!!
5618 2018-10-05 01:54:44 Normal stocks true.  Not Tesla where all the news comes the minute after the end of the trading day and drops 30-40 overnight instantly with no chance to react.
5619 2018-10-05 01:54:35 You women seem intent on sticking it to good men. Well I'm starting a new personal policy. I will no longer vote for down ballot women or for women on the Board when I vote my stocks. Small justice, but I'll feel better.
5620 2018-10-05 01:54:31 Good. Fuck cube. They can go to a new label and watch from their thrones with framed pictures of the dropped stocks
5621 2018-10-05 01:54:04 none as of now. not even stocks
5622 2018-10-05 01:53:29 Where are you on Amazon raising their minimum wage but dumping all other incentives like stocks? Some people will end up with less because those stocks are soaring.
5623 2018-10-05 01:52:45 “Decline in stocks is not a surprising event. It recurs. If you live in cold climate, you expect freezing
temperatures and when it drops below zero you don’t think of this as the beginning of the next ice
age. You know summer will be warm again. Stocks do the same” – Peter Lynch
5624 2018-10-05 01:52:26 Ended up meeting a financial advisor.... he talked about all the weed stocks on my list smh
5625 2018-10-05 01:51:58 Yea ok. I’m not going to have cyclical internet arguments with someone that demands sources for stats then stocks their fingers in their ears when it’s provided. 
5626 2018-10-05 01:51:54 But stocks are my life :)
5627 2018-10-05 01:51:45 U know i stay away from namebrand stocks but i might have to break my own rules real quick 
5628 2018-10-05 01:51:19 Stocks? I want to be away and do my job and live life

5630 2018-10-05 01:50:49 I want to be away from $TSLA and focus on other stocks but EM is not letting me do that 
5631 2018-10-05 01:50:44 @elonmusk I signed up for Twitter just to say to you: Thank you for everything you are doing to fix the world. I have some ideas for how I can support your mission. Look forward to meeting you. 

P.s. I agree shorting stocks is bad. Almost fell for the allure of the quick money.
5632 2018-10-05 01:50:38 You're always so positive! I think of you to calm down when I get totally freaked.  I'm getting calmer.  These toads will never last.  McConnell, Grassley, Hatch should be put in stocks at the end of the Reflection Pool or the front of Lincoln Memorial.
5633 2018-10-05 01:50:13 The advice I’ve heard and follow is don’t day trade, you won’t get better returns than low expense ratio ETF. So then if you’re investing long term, use Roth IRA for tax benefits. That said I use Robinhood for occasionally buying stocks on off companies I like but bulk is in IRA.
5634 2018-10-05 01:50:02 thursday (thirstday) nights freshman year: fifth of raspberry smirnoff and lemonade, late night grill, running from RAs, hotbox showers
thursday nights now: got a quick lift in, on my 2nd podcast, checking stocks, sipping a glass of red wine
5635 2018-10-05 01:49:48 Okay so i need to invest in stocks and start building my credit before my sophomore year is over
5636 2018-10-05 01:48:52 @SenSanders So it is great that Amazon raised the minimum pay to $15. an hour, but now they are not giving stocks or bonuses to their employees and will be relying more on machines to save $.
5637 2018-10-05 01:48:51 Nice. I just kinda don't see the point in falling with them while you both have 2 stocks though. Except maybe showing off. The combos ARE pretty smooth and cool.
5638 2018-10-05 01:47:51 guess i’m selling my tesla stocks now ://
5639 2018-10-05 01:46:51 to explain, Robin hood doesn't charge you a transaction fee to buy stocks or etfs, so they get their commission by routing your orders through their partners. their partners take your order, buy it from someone else for a bit less, and sell it to you at a slightly higher price
5640 2018-10-05 01:45:02 When are you tweeting to tell that U.S. Stocks are overvalued, sell!! Just like you tweeted abt Oil
5641 2018-10-05 01:44:43 Many US stocks are owned by non US citizens. Only 30 percent of Americans own stock. Tell me about the cost of gas. Of Sheetrock and healthcare.
5642 2018-10-05 01:44:33 This Christmas I want some stocks. Invest in my portfolio.
5643 2018-10-05 01:44:31 Yes, it really is insanity. Of all the stocks one can buy, what on earth would entice one to this junk....

5646 2018-10-05 01:43:11 If the negatives outweigh the positives they are a negative force.

Regardless it should be legal, but people should be aware how their stocks are lent to shorts.
5647 2018-10-05 01:43:05 How to buy what is the url
5648 2018-10-05 01:42:22 If you scream fire every single day and celebrate the one day you are right, have at it. How's that long gold, short dollar,  short US stocks trade going of the last 10 years
5649 2018-10-05 01:42:22 Потому что по факту, хорошо, если сейчас на него 1% примерно капает. Fixed income - 3%, US or Canadian stocks - 7%. Это то, что нам посчитали умные дяди и тёти экономисты, и это реальность, которую я вижу перед глазами на работе.
5650 2018-10-05 01:41:53 OH SHIT HYUNA AND EDAWN ARE ACTUALLY BEING LET GO??? WE GOING DOWNSTOCKS!!

5652 2018-10-05 01:40:55 Gambling is gambling, whether at casinos, or with grossly overvalued stocks.

5656 2018-10-05 01:40:22 The only thing he did was make Amazon more money because now they cut the monthly bonuses and stocks they were giving to employees.
5657 2018-10-05 01:40:00 Это очень много процентов для консервативного портфолио. У нас это 5%. Я говорю про то, когда там и stocks и bonds есть. Когда мы строим финансовые проекции и планы для клиентов, то у нас такие данные по returns по умолчанию:
Cash (and cash-like investments) 2%. И это очень щедро
5658 2018-10-05 01:39:26 i am not sure what to expect mid month, so much negativity from analysts about the price of cannabis stocks, i have other cannabis stocks which have seen insane gains throughout september i am kind of worried about... but this one though, $nept i am in for the long term

5662 2018-10-05 01:38:10 That's what the best do! If you spend all your time researching stocks you own, you'll get left behind. Research is done before buying, then continue with close monitoring of that stock.. but mostly should be researching other stocks. Good stuff!!
5663 2018-10-05 01:37:32 What about pumping stocks with fake buyout offers?

5672 2018-10-05 01:34:01 okay so many but not all stocks and funds periodically make straight-up cash payments to their shareholders, called dividends. if your broker has a Dividend Reinvestment Program or DRIP, you can take the 40 cents per share you get from Coca Cola and buy a tiny fraction of a share
5673 2018-10-05 01:33:52 cube better not confirm this to be true their stocks are going in the trash
5674 2018-10-05 01:33:46 Shorting is a way to transmit and price stocks that SHOULD fall but haven't yet faster and more efficiently.  There's nothing wrong with predicting and profiting from failure, failure is a part of business in the end, not every company is destined to be an immortal monolith.
5675 2018-10-05 01:33:21 Acording to media Mr Trump says silly things every day. Every day employment, stocks and confidence grow in USA. 

Hope the same to Brazil!

5676 2018-10-05 01:32:59 this still isn't official news. there's no official statement from cube, and even if there is, their stocks will definitely drop a bit

1. #Crudeoil went up; trading above $85; #India ramp up #Iran oil imports ahead of sanctions.
2. #US #yields at 7 yr high; #global #stocks sink.
3. #Gold steady; #Dollar firm.
4. #RBI likely to raise #reporate today to arrest #Rupee slide.
5. #NIFTY looks weak.
5680 2018-10-05 01:31:31 $SPY There's a HUGE bankers clique in MKT as you can see, 90% of the stocks do the same thing at the same exact time Drop, Chop or Pop Days
5681 2018-10-05 01:30:44 The downside is that you're better off with an IRA and if you're looking to do basic investing then buying individual stocks is probably not the right play
5682 2018-10-05 01:29:49 Wrong on point 2.  Pessimism related to stocks is more often a bullish sign.  Except for the sheep.
5683 2018-10-05 01:28:54 otherwise it's good to go, being able to buy stocks and etfs without transaction fees is legit

5686 2018-10-05 01:27:52 Trump IS in charge and the nation's economy is booming, unemployment down, tax cuts, military getting stronger, wages up, stocks at an all time high----prisoners back from No Korea along with military remains,
5687 2018-10-05 01:27:11 The point wrt PPFAS is the KIND of US stocks it  has, the current bull market winners. 

If i HAD to invest some money in US i would use index funds like the S&P 500.

The broader point - a resource like money is limited. Diversification doesn't work especially cross currency!
5688 2018-10-05 01:27:05 is it true that hyuna and edawn officially left cube because if so we gotta do another cube takedown and make them lose their stocks like last time

5692 2018-10-05 01:24:45 Seems hard to find a more positive argument for short sellers than: they overpay to borrow stocks that are worth more than they think and that subsidizes cheaper index investing.
5693 2018-10-05 01:24:13 Damnnnnnn welp bye to cube’s stocks for real then
5694 2018-10-05 01:23:50 so like if no one at cube has a heart, maybe the fact that they’d be losing money and their stocks would plummet more could be SOMETHING to convince them to just let this all pass
5695 2018-10-05 01:23:06 Since they decided to stoop soo low their stocks are going down with them

5698 2018-10-05 01:22:23 Just Stocks and bonds
5699 2018-10-05 01:22:23 How is it a scam to use the money they get from lending out shares to make their index funds cheaper and more accessible?
Isn’t that the opposite of a scam and a social good they provide by making index funds cheaper by letting “fools” short stocks that are worth a lot?

5710 2018-10-05 01:17:51 А если 10 лет, то это совсем другая история. Там хоть все stocks можно. Но опять же, если ты потом это будешь вынимать для ипотеки, то я бы хотя бы 10% bonds положила в портфолио на всякий случай. В смысле, bond ETF или MF.
5711 2018-10-05 01:17:06 Too easy to spread false information and drive stocks up or down, leaves itself open to fraud.
5712 2018-10-05 01:17:01 Also stocks drop all the time and it’s not the end of the world for cube that’s just what stocks do and it’s doesn’t really affect how much money the company (unless I guess they own some of their own stocks)
5713 2018-10-05 01:15:41 It should be. Short sellers are literally selling stocks they don’t own.
5714 2018-10-05 01:14:58 The economy has been soaring with Trump (according to him) so why haven't wages increased like you state? Stock market is high but majority of stocks aren't owned by middle & lower classes (some have 401k through work but this isn't directly accessible).

5726 2018-10-05 01:08:36 Not at all. A short seller thinks the price is wrong and high. If it drops enough many will take the opposite view. In the case of Tesla many feel ch11 is overdue but I guess most short sellers short sell stocks that are simply price bubbles no matter how their business is.
5727 2018-10-05 01:07:54 Common decency would not be dragging an honorable judge through the muck just because trump picked him we were told stocks would tank run for the hills if he was elected we see how that worked out look @ NK & there is USMCA unemployment lowest

5747 2018-10-05 01:01:27 I don't follow. People hold stocks because they believe they will increase in value. They use indexes to help them select broad portfolios, but ultimately are buying in to a theme or thesis. If they believe that, then they should be thrilled to earn yield as the stocks increase.

5777 2018-10-05 00:52:22 No, it isn't.

Short sellers borrow stocks and sell them immediately, hoping to buy them back later for less when they return them. That's not even remotely similar to taking a deposit for a new product.
5778 2018-10-05 00:51:42 Well, I hope they figure it out soon because these things have a way of catching up and it looks like stocks are sharply overvalued and we are headed for a major correction. Again, I don't know if those two things are connected.

5796 2018-10-05 00:40:04 That is a good question, I have no answer. I have noticed is before the earnings they sell off than pick up pace after NFLX earning after which they sell off. I have not done any studies. A paper published that 2 weeks before earnings the premium start to pick up for the stocks
5797 2018-10-05 00:39:23 “tactically reduce exposure to stocks to dynamically manage our risk”. 

What a concept...limiting client draw-downs in a weak market. I love it.

Never-sell Pie Chart Hacks don’t understand it.
5798 2018-10-05 00:38:16 Is this really what keeps you up at night?  How about some positives?   You have a great well paying job.   You’ve got money in the bank.  Stocks are up so your 401k is doing great.  Isn’t America Great Again??
5799 2018-10-05 00:38:09 Yes also I was thinking in the event of there being a sort of sell off of Canadian stocks or a negative imapct of some kind.  Thanks for the insight and comment.
5800 2018-10-05 00:37:39 Selecting stocks. @AIServicesCH --XEXQDHOYZ
5801 2018-10-05 00:37:22 Wonder how their stocks survives and how they are traded and how they are rated. Is that only few experts knows how these companies annual reports are to be interpreted ?  Is Government has to much influence and control and also bring success to business ?
5802 2018-10-05 00:36:06 @SPBSEIndices After heavy selling in Indian stocks on 04Oct2018, the total market cap of all BSE stocks closed for the day at Rs 140.40 lakh crores.
5803 2018-10-05 00:34:41 Exactly people wont put their money in stocks, banks, they will secure it in gold or crypto.
5804 2018-10-05 00:33:07 I would like to read about financial markets and stocks which is what I would expect from a site called marketwatch,  not politics.
5805 2018-10-05 00:33:07 @DBChirpy tax cuts helping 1% buy back stocks & invest in Cayman Islands. Trump lied to Coal workers. Lied to steel workers. Lied to farmers. Trump flat out lies all the time. We had 16 real qualified candidates in 2016. Trump is massive @gop & @SenMajLdr & @GOPLeader fail.
5806 2018-10-05 00:32:27 Literally cube just used them to save their stocks in that moment
Their first statement sounded like they were never gonna forgive Hyuna and Edawn..
Why drag it on for so long...
5807 2018-10-05 00:32:19 Well, hopefully he has made the most of his money and invested into some good stocks.
5808 2018-10-05 00:32:10 Unfortunately for the poor most of the rich make their money without working and don't hire 1000s to work for them. 

Trickle down is voodoo economics. Corps used tax cuts to buy back stocks and inflate worth.
5809 2018-10-05 00:31:37 This is NUTS! This country would have been in worse shape if Hillabeast won! We’d be observing Sharia law,our voices would not be heard,unemployment would be at it’s highest,stocks at their lowest,and the negative laundry list goes on! G-d bless our @realDonaldTrump Him!
5810 2018-10-05 00:30:58 Stock exchange should be decentralized. Then there wont be suit wearing financial monsters who group to target specific industry or company stocks for individual benefits(bonuses) @RobinhoodApp is doing small help towards it already.
5811 2018-10-05 00:30:47 Aussie shares open softer with the #ASX 200 -8pts or 0.13% to 6168. Materials & energy stocks weighing after outperforming over recent sessions #ausbiz
5812 2018-10-05 00:30:29 Imagine if you were taxed on stocks that way! Every time the stock went up you got a bill. However when the stock went down you didn’t get a refund! A house is just an investment! Tax me when I sell!
5813 2018-10-05 00:30:16 No they didn’t.
5814 2018-10-05 00:30:16 It should be illegal not to be long stocks
5815 2018-10-05 00:30:15 1. Short selling is one source of the true value of stocks, reduces the information asymmetry the Vatican complains of. 2. Would you permit us to buy stocks but not to sell them? Right!

5819 2018-10-05 00:28:40 Hey @marcorubio Vote no on Kavanaugh, start taking action for gun control, prohibit bump stocks and become a democrat, we will take you in.
5820 2018-10-05 00:28:28 I would say majority of employees are better off.  Especially since workers have to stay with amazon for at least a year to get stocks.  Amazon has a high turnover rate.
5821 2018-10-05 00:26:42 aure can...keep up the great work!!! And if ya have any extra time we all love when ya make  the LOOSER LEFTISTS cry.

5822 2018-10-05 00:26:12 Canadians need to start supporting Canadian Business and buy BlackBerry. Just like Americans bought GM, Dodge, Ford stocks.
5823 2018-10-05 00:26:09 Now is the time to build a watchlist of stocks you want to own going forward. Let them build bases and test 50ma levels and see which ones hold up best. When the market is ready to climb again, that's when you buy the strongest ones.
5824 2018-10-05 00:24:48 why are you hell bent on destroying my life saving's invested in your company stocks

5829 2018-10-05 00:23:01 Stocks are never meant to be a one sided ride. Corrections can be a good test of your convictions and a true measure of greed vs fear.
5830 2018-10-05 00:22:19 Hey fucknuts, maybe read a little. The headline alone suggests the article was gonna say that the widening gap could indicate those stocks could have been artificially inflated, which is almost guaranteed cuz that's what the tax cut was used for. And that's really really bad.
5831 2018-10-05 00:21:57 I’m so confused on how stocks and bonds work wtf
5832 2018-10-05 00:21:28 1-10 I'm at a 7.5 with this cold. And my dramatic ass came to sleep at bf's bcs he's always stocks up on medicine :) & por enculada
5833 2018-10-05 00:20:47 AS IF COMPANIES AND LONGS DON'T PUMP STOCKS. Your stock is worth 50B and you haven't earned a profit, & you've so mismanaged things that you have little cash on hand to satisfy debt payments coming due. WTF of course $tsla attracts shorts. @elonmusk shld be fired
5834 2018-10-05 00:19:18 Yes it was a stunt they literally gave us two meetings one to tell us no raise because we compete after stocks and bonuses the next day they take that away but give us a raise to 15. Oh and after 2 years of hard work you only get 5 cents raise.
5835 2018-10-05 00:18:58 @YahooNews 04Oct2018: Indian G-Sec prices were quite weak in today's session amidst weak rupee and heavy selling in Indian stocks. The10-year G-Sec (7.17% GS 2028) yield closed for the day at  8.16 per cent.

5837 2018-10-05 00:17:56 Most people don’t own stocks and @Amazon  just took stocks away to  workers
5838 2018-10-05 00:17:28 @mjl929 mjl Maybe you shouldn't be trading stocks if you think that
5839 2018-10-05 00:17:05 We do realize there is only one preclinical drug
5840 2018-10-05 00:16:26 shorting stocks is where instead of buying shares to make the price go up, you take a gamble that the price is going to go down and that makes money somehow. lots of people are mocking him by saying they're shorting tesla stock which is making him and his sycophants soooooooo mad
5841 2018-10-05 00:16:03 @InvestorsLive One of my favorite things about IU is the raw variety of stocks/styles that are traded. It is as if you have 10 more pair of eyes added on to your two. This added *vision enables you to broaden your trading scope while drawing from an array of brilliant traders.
5842 2018-10-05 00:15:02 Clone stocks should shoot through the ceiling after this!
5843 2018-10-05 00:14:48 I started really suspecting one of those two when the financial stuff started to be a focus. I thought it must be someone who wanted the stocks to crash and then recover and those two always worrying about money was some good foreshadowing #Ekpesbookclub
5844 2018-10-05 00:14:34 Stocks are taking a little dip right now, but they are continuing to rise so that is a good sign. #BA3500LUIGI
5845 2018-10-05 00:11:33 Looking forward to tomorrow! 
5846 2018-10-05 00:09:52 Of course you understand that all our markets connect, so their stocks tanking means they won’t buy much of our stuff. You flunk Econ 101
5847 2018-10-05 00:09:27 #Sénégal #SONACOS les syndicalistes inquiets parce qu'ils ont du mal à écouler leurs stocks de produits. Je part chez mon grossiste acheter le seau d'huile il me dit qu'ils ont du mal à le trouver alors que ça coûte moins chère. Bizarre! @PrimatureSn @ascosen @aliounesarr
5848 2018-10-05 00:09:25 US stocks closed lower as investors reasses the impact of a higher risk-free rate after the US 10Y yield reached a 7-year high. #ustracker #morninghuddle
5849 2018-10-05 00:09:24 Pbrain blocked me but i totally see him losing this bet by a landslide. He even has the advantage of an army (or maybe one guy pretending to be so many people) of pumpers behind him stuffing those stocks down peoples throats and he still can't get the job done lol #failure
5850 2018-10-05 00:08:52 I think Riley Rose stocks online brands! They have beauty bakerie, lime crime & glitter injections. I would love to see your stuff there
5851 2018-10-05 00:08:10 GLOBAL MARKETS-Dollar lifted by yield surge, Asia stocks slugged
5852 2018-10-05 00:07:56 No, short selling are fine if you own the underlying stock. They way they can “borrow” others stocks to sell short should be illegal. If they don’t own the stick they can just play the Options market.
5853 2018-10-05 00:05:36 US stocks drop 200 points today (DJIA).

5856 2018-10-05 00:03:28 the platform is super modular though so you learn how to build specific parts at a time, eg. changing stocks or changing gas blocks.
