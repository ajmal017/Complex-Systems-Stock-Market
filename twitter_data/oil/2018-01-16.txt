4 2018-01-16 23:59:45 Yawn.....yep that tax plan is REALLY going to affect my tax bracket, I’m really going to rake in the dividends now. I’m sure that offshore oil drilling is going to work overnight on making us energy independent, much cleaner than solar. Im CONVINCED!

51 2018-01-16 23:56:21 It kinda depends what we're dipping. If bread, I might make a case for olive oil

53 2018-01-16 23:56:12 You have me there! It’s a beautiful country with a rich heritage and has tons of money due to the oil industry! I often wonder why my grandparents immigrated here in the 1940s but then I remember...

62 2018-01-16 23:54:52 Oil is literally good for you. Fat is good for you and oh, on a minor note, ESSENTIAL FOR YOUR CONTINUED SURVIVAL. Pizza is VERY good, especially for me. Scuse me while I go chug a pint of whole milk.
63 2018-01-16 23:54:42 If only there was a way for our oil to get out to global markets....

65 2018-01-16 23:54:37 Hi Neena, what form is the coconut in? Oil? Looks superb
66 2018-01-16 23:54:37 I eat my pizza cold the next morning for breakfast, so the oil is actually cold, solid & congealed not warm at all!

75 2018-01-16 23:53:27 How much oil is equivalent to an entire pizza?
76 2018-01-16 23:53:24 It's fine, they have the same properties it's just that conventional oil breaks down faster.
77 2018-01-16 23:53:18 It’s too much weed varieties to still be poppin pills n drinking lean. Bud, oil, edibles etc no need for man made drugs
78 2018-01-16 23:53:17 It’s probably not the actual plant they have oil’s and things like that

So who’s really eating healthier 
105 2018-01-16 23:48:04 Yeah 40k is sorta like space Catholicism/Emperor Constantine/Song of Roland with extra Judas’s and less (or way more) racism because they’re fighting demons and nonhumans (and heretics). If you’re not into tabletop check out the dawn of war game series. Decent RTS.
106 2018-01-16 23:47:30 There is oil production within LA, which in its regulatory oversight going back decades implicitly consented to production since they could have stopped it. Royalties paid to LA might preclude them from suit.

117 2018-01-16 23:46:01 told my mom i think i need an inhaler and she told me to take an essential oil pill then talked about how she doesn’t trust the government why are b*by b**mers like this

119 2018-01-16 23:45:51 Yeah....I followed procedures.  Trying to dispose of coolant, brake fluid, transmission oil, etc.  AutoZone won't take it and to schedule an appt with Waste Management requires an acct number with them.  My HOA handles our trash and won't give me acct info.  Left a msg at the #.
120 2018-01-16 23:45:40 I can change the oil but I always forget the filter.
121 2018-01-16 23:45:18 Also, many believe that burning biofuels will reduce carbon dioxide emissions and slow global warming. While biofuels can reduce our dependence on foreign oil, new research raises questions about whether they will help slow global warming.
122 2018-01-16 23:45:18 We conduct studies to increase productivity of oil fields.
123 2018-01-16 23:45:11 I’m curious what the benefits of cooking with hemp oil are
124 2018-01-16 23:45:00 "We will resist the dangerous and wrong attempt to allow drilling for oil off our precious shore. We will not allow this threat to our environment and our economy to stand..." (1/2)
125 2018-01-16 23:44:41 Derelict vessels are a pain. If it's not navigation hazard then Army Corps won't do anything. Not spilling oil, USCG won't touch it. And state has no money.
126 2018-01-16 23:44:32 *grabs popcorn flavorized oil*
127 2018-01-16 23:44:18 People need to research Rick Simpson oil. Yes it cures cancer. Full spectrum plant oil amazing stuff. Many other uses as well. And hemp should replace most all of what trees are used for.

129 2018-01-16 23:44:08 United Oil and Gas reaches farmout agreement with Corallian Energy
130 2018-01-16 23:43:54 Biofuels are all the rage. With soaring oil prices and a desire to reduce our dependence on foreign energy resources, there's a lot of interest in growing corn and other crops to be processed into fuel, such as ethanol.
131 2018-01-16 23:43:35 I went to all my classes, I worked out, came home to clean and cook, showered, out on a face mask after and cleansed my face with an oil free cleanser. Biittttchh i feel brand fucking new 
132 2018-01-16 23:42:52 Jane, I read about your brush with cancer. Take on tsp of coconut oil daily. Keep in in the mouth for 5 min. Then sallow it. The oil can kill 93% of cancerous cells in the colon. Even better in the mouth. Stay safe.
133 2018-01-16 23:42:45 #Sanchi oil disaster: There are now two huge oil slicks covering 52 square miles of ocean, compared with just four square miles the previous day. Strong winds were pushing the spill toward Japan, reports NYT
134 2018-01-16 23:42:21 through trial and disgusting barfing error i finally know i react very badly to old seed oil -- which is usually what's in a commercial fryer.

i basically can't have fried food out anymore.
135 2018-01-16 23:41:58 "You're never home Idk what you do all day" "did you REALLY go get your oil changed...i never saw the receipt." like no fuck you, it's not like you're not working and going to school 40 plus hours a week.

146 2018-01-16 23:39:28 運が良かった…！٩( ᐛ )و
147 2018-01-16 23:39:21 its been a long day. you arrive home and finally, within the comfort of your very own room, you can be horny on main.

but something goes wrong. there's the warmth in your belly and your knees buckle, but no tent is pitched. no boner is popped.

you... pop hot, sizzling oil.
148 2018-01-16 23:39:20 Do we look United like right now to you? Unity to a Norther is having a Northern president, controlling all the oil blocks and juicy appointments and then stealing our lands by force to graze cattle that we buy with money.. Jeez.. see maga and 419
149 2018-01-16 23:39:12 Aren't they saying yes to other things? She purports there's "a U.S.-funded campaign that continues the U.S. monopoly on crude oil" ...doesnt elaborate. These 27% donors are actually pro (U.S.) oil?
150 2018-01-16 23:39:10 thank your Government  they got paid big money by the oil industry
151 2018-01-16 23:39:10 Copaiba mixed with coconut oil.
152 2018-01-16 23:39:07 Eu também estou farta  o bio oil é super super bom e tem resultado na minha pele. Mas agora vou começar a tomar medicação para o acne a ver se isto limpa tudo
153 2018-01-16 23:39:02 OIL DIFF: 5.54 -> 5.54
154 2018-01-16 23:39:02 *Put more oil on the kart* Heh HEH heh #Dingobot
155 2018-01-16 23:38:53 That sounds amazing Katelyn! Cupcake is certainly a scrumptious treat for your skin with spearmint oil and vanilla absolute! What did you love most about this deep-cleansing chocolate treat!  
156 2018-01-16 23:38:27 I would eat the oil *and* the pizza if necessary.
157 2018-01-16 23:38:24 To wash my hair I use Tea Tree oil as a pre-poo and then ACV as my actual “shampoo”.
158 2018-01-16 23:38:14 OIL DIFF: 5.51 -> 5.58
159 2018-01-16 23:38:04 Mine needs an oil change
160 2018-01-16 23:38:02 If dry skin i pakai snail punya. Byk kali cuci pon muka tak kering. I mmg pesen sebelum amik wudhu mesti nak cuci muka. Kalau guna product lain muka kering. But using bi essence snail x kering dah. Oil pon kurang. Jerawat lagi la kurang. Parut pon tp lambat la...
161 2018-01-16 23:38:01 @exxonmobil These proud gop members defied the world and let us be only country out of Paris agreement...and they stood up against big oil & Rex Tillerson.
162 2018-01-16 23:37:49 I got an oil change & my car sounds and runs so much better... what a concept
163 2018-01-16 23:37:44 I give you credit for trying Jude, but some people besides being rude will never see the other side. Given that veganism promoting quinoa etc is making these basic staples unaffordable in countries of origin, starving the poorest, doesnt matter. Palm oil, rainforest soya etc etc.
164 2018-01-16 23:37:22 Straight from the Alberta Oil Magazine and you still think it’s bogus? Can you critically think for yourself at all???
165 2018-01-16 23:37:20 @bulletproofexec, serioius question for you: how long into taking mct oil should one expect to not be running to the toilet every 20 mins to unload 2 gallons of liquid intestinal nuclear waste.  Asking for a friend.
166 2018-01-16 23:37:18 And might wear a du-rag or sleep on a satin pillowcase and is familiar with Shea Moisture, Pink Oil, Duke (not the school), or Murrays.

171 2018-01-16 23:36:49 I wash my face with coconut oil I use it as a hair mask, as a hair oil to get rid of frizz, I cook with it, use it for oil pulling and it removes your makeup wyd 
172 2018-01-16 23:36:36 Lmaoo I don't do twitter girls 
173 2018-01-16 23:36:15 Thing about the West Coast I'd have better options for making extra money I could hang in Santa Cruz. I'd never live in Texas though the rich white oil tycoon attitude is just a lil too big for me to handle.
174 2018-01-16 23:36:14 Im an ealry 30s female still nursing a toddler and contemplating having a second child. I try to take Vit D, multivitamin, folate and fish oil orally. I suspect topical vitamins for beauty purposes are a scam and not necessary or youth enhancing. Looking forward to your project!
175 2018-01-16 23:36:10 Salt oil n a garlic clove ;)
176 2018-01-16 23:36:08 Well Iraq was about oil not 9/11.
177 2018-01-16 23:36:07 I’ve never seen anything. But advice from my NP and nutritionist friends has been: lots of fat. I’ve been told to go crazy with avocado, coconut oil, etc (so I’m all ) I’m also not limiting fruit.
178 2018-01-16 23:35:34 I pour that much olbas oil on my tissue that my eyes sting and water
179 2018-01-16 23:35:32 I started cooking my kale in coconut oil and I finally understand what the wypipo have been talking about... it’s scrumptious
180 2018-01-16 23:35:24 *enters the room drinking a can of oil* hi
181 2018-01-16 23:34:58 W Boe price of Solar+storage headed toward $25, & cost of fueling EVs about 1/5th an ICE-powered vehicle, it’s hard to see a future for oil production in West CDA. Burt we should be concerned about the unequal impacts of a carbon tax across rural Canada in the transition @PnPCBC
182 2018-01-16 23:34:44 Si puedes comprar, actúa... Es momento d comprar en el valle y esperar el pico... Y gozar las ganancias o llorar las pérdidas... Siempre es una apuesta... Yo apuesto que las ganancias d la subida del OIL van a terminar empujando el rally del BTC y el ETH... saludos
183 2018-01-16 23:34:43 Let me stop beating tf out of my head and just oil my scalp 
184 2018-01-16 23:34:40 And we should ignore all the money from oil companies.
185 2018-01-16 23:34:38 Stock tip: short snake oil companies.
186 2018-01-16 23:34:31 Why do dealerships take forever to do an oil change
187 2018-01-16 23:34:21 Those are oil countries, it wasn't done by mistake.
188 2018-01-16 23:34:19 I cooked chicken & sausage gumbo with a coconut oil based roux and I’m happy that it came out delicious
189 2018-01-16 23:34:17 It has mustard seed powder mixed with Rosemary oil, Eucalyptus oil and Chamomile flowers. Smells amazing!
It's like bath salts so they dissolve in the bath water. You sweat like crazy! I feel like it helps relax the muscles too... And it smells amazing!!!
190 2018-01-16 23:33:51 Every1 wants more/cheaper fuels; no 1 wants wells in their backyard. Then sell ur cars, walk, or bicycle, turn out ur lights, sit in the dark w/no heat.  Or change to total solar and wind power for their property & cars. American oil, not foreign oil.
191 2018-01-16 23:33:51 and the box be slippery like you tryna walk on oil
192 2018-01-16 23:33:50 Here is the argument against climate change deniers:

If CC is wrong, what's the downside? We develop new energy sources, become more energy independent, can sell tech to countries w/o oil.

If we're right, we're working toward avoiding catastrophe.

No downside.
193 2018-01-16 23:33:33 Accidentally buying a can of tuna in oil instead of water &lt;&lt;&lt;
194 2018-01-16 23:33:24 The problem with your £70k houses is that the people in your area can't sustain themselves. They've been impoverished by Thatcherite policies that fattened the rich. Oslo is the most expensive city in the world thanks to their oil economy. You can't compare chalk with cheese.
195 2018-01-16 23:33:22 It’s ok because it was from tax payers, it doesn’t hurt the corporations because they only profit from war and oil, while the American people pay for the war with tax dollars and their children’s lives while corporations make billions in oil profits. It’s a win win for them.
196 2018-01-16 23:33:12 I’m glad I can stop drinking this oil, if I’m honest.
197 2018-01-16 23:33:07 Please what is factually disgusting?

Lift regulations
Cut back on admin  positions
Tax relief
Less people on food stamps
More people making more
Stock Market exploding
Land back to States
Oil independent
Withdraw TPP
Renegotiating NAFTA

What he's done..except put #AmericaFirst
198 2018-01-16 23:33:05 Clove oil is ruthless
199 2018-01-16 23:32:51 hi so i definitely misread this as pooping so i think i found something more terrifying than popping oil
200 2018-01-16 23:32:44 Iranian oil tanker now burning, at least 32 presumed dead, among  deadliest offshore oil disasters ever, including: Piper Alpha 167 killed, Kielland 123 killed, Seacrest 91 killed, Ocean Ranger 84 killed, Glomar Java 81 killed, Bohai 76 killed, Enchova 42 killed, & now the Sanchi

205 2018-01-16 23:31:14 *roasting a big batch of onions, carrots and cauliflower* What is it about roasting big hearty vegetables in olive oil makes them so extra delicious? Is it just that fire improves everything? That’s my dragon philosophy.
206 2018-01-16 23:30:59 Last week while at my auto mechanic for an oil change, they had a vintage 1930's black Taxi Cab out in front. It was amazing to see. Also, we hardly ever see British cars here. The thing was speaking to me. 
207 2018-01-16 23:30:48 is there anything more frightening than popping oil? if so i have yet to encounter it
208 2018-01-16 23:30:24 How wonderful, how beautiful when brothers & sisters get along! It's like costly anointing oil, flowing down head and beard. #Psalm 133:1-2 MSG
209 2018-01-16 23:30:04 $67 for an oil change?????
210 2018-01-16 23:29:53 พี่ช่วยได้

212 2018-01-16 23:29:46 Thursday price changes: Heating/stove oils to increase by 5/10ths, Diesel to increase by 7/10ths and Gasoline shows an increase of 2.3 cents a litre. Canadian dollar mostly steady as does oil after last week's rise to $70 US...
213 2018-01-16 23:29:46 Burning the midnight oil?
214 2018-01-16 23:29:36 I have a friend allergic to his own sweat. Maybe you're allergic to your own oil?
215 2018-01-16 23:29:32 Oil thinks we did not notice .15 cents increase in gas prices needed to pay for higher heating oil prices.
216 2018-01-16 23:29:29 Fellow Abusite
217 2018-01-16 23:29:26 So. Heating oil has gone up in price. Gasoline is up in price. Very difficult times for me. How can this economy be so great
218 2018-01-16 23:29:13 @djaromaGH Big Bro ask Majid can u use the magic bear oil for 5 ...5
219 2018-01-16 23:28:50 I acc might hahahahahaha. It’s literally just frozen chips (wasn’t arsed to make them) with chilli infused oil, garlic powder and then this ‘chillies and onion’ powder on them it’s so handy!!!
220 2018-01-16 23:28:49 Tonight I cooked fresh chicken, pasta and green beans/mushrooms sautéed in olive oil and garlic. I also put a piece of bread on the plate. Remi only ate the bread and when he finished it told me “get in the kitchen mommy” and exited to his room. Great dinner son.
221 2018-01-16 23:28:39 +baby oil or rose water
222 2018-01-16 23:28:36 Happiness is a moment, a cigarette, a beer, a whiskey, a chocolate bar, whatever you’re poison is, it’s not a permanent state of mind, a lot of people making a lot of cash selling snake oil and self help
223 2018-01-16 23:28:21 Coconut oil + other tropical oils promote repair of living cells. They contain lauric acid which fights bacteria +fungus +microbes +parasites +virus. Since can't patent it it gets over looked when it shld b main focus of all disease prevention. The brain is fat. Feed it good fat.
224 2018-01-16 23:28:14 @realDonaldTrump high quality fish oil, high on DHA more than the EPA. Anti-oxidant Astaxanthin & Vit C. Magnesium w/vit D3 & vit K2-MK-7.  Most especially a high micro flora probiotic for the gut. All vit & minerals r depleted from our fruits & veggies due to pesticides on them.
225 2018-01-16 23:28:12 I love when I drop something in the fryer and the hot oil splashed all over me
226 2018-01-16 23:28:03 We currently make nothing from oil whilst oil companies are making a higher margin than ever before. Westminster mismanagement at its finest giving it away so the richest get richer
227 2018-01-16 23:27:48 serum oil control EU TE AMO
228 2018-01-16 23:27:43 The Trump administration’s plans to open our coastlines to oil and gas drilling are shortsighted and wrong. 1/x
229 2018-01-16 23:27:33 I went through my house with a fresh bottle of oil and anointed EVERYTHING!
230 2018-01-16 23:27:28 Coconut oil works wonders
231 2018-01-16 23:27:26 Coconut oil. Takes everything off
232 2018-01-16 23:27:19 Change oil+tire rotation then picking up a parcel from USPS. Tita lakad on my off day :|

234 2018-01-16 23:27:12 Got to be the stupidest law suit possible, when did big oil make Al gore own 5 mansions or make Leon Dicaprio own a yacht or you take all those air plane rides.
So called climate change if the perfect vehicles of the left cause they get to blame someone else for their life style
235 2018-01-16 23:27:08 Run me a bubble bath, play my favorite love songs, and lay me on the bed and rub me down with oil. Don’t speak, just communicate through these three things. REAL SIMPLE, REAL LOVE, REAL PASSIONATE, JUST REAL. 
236 2018-01-16 23:26:50 Exxon Oil Spill -- Louisiana -- was minor compared to what is coming soon.
237 2018-01-16 23:26:43 So essential oil diffusers are bad for cats apparently
238 2018-01-16 23:26:42 I probably saw such great results using coconut oil because before I was using watery-lotion.. that most likely was hand/body lotion . I’m a man, I don’t know better lmao
239 2018-01-16 23:26:17 @y1025fm Eeeeaaasy! Aroma I wan noe the price for the product(magic oil)

243 2018-01-16 23:25:34 People who pronounce "pant" as "payint" and "oil" as "oyel",kindly move this way please,ose! 
244 2018-01-16 23:25:31 Do you remember when he increased domestic oil production to it's highest level in the countries history.
245 2018-01-16 23:25:26 Mmmm oil
246 2018-01-16 23:25:24 まだ寝れるなら寝とこうw
247 2018-01-16 23:25:09 not true....from nestle  -  The orange Smarties is flavoured with natural orange oil. Smarties are not only fun to play with, but have also contained no artificial colours or flavours since 2006.
248 2018-01-16 23:24:47 *continues to use coconut oil*  lol
249 2018-01-16 23:24:47 did we need research?  a trip to anywhere in Africa will tell you that.  the most obvious questions are "what happens to the wealth created here?"  "where does the 'aid' go?"  huge diamond found in Lesotho?  "oil rich" Nigeria?  can't tell by looking.
250 2018-01-16 23:24:44 Don’t play with my child  deep conditioners and hot oil treatments soon come 
251 2018-01-16 23:24:40 Auf dem Boden der U-Bahn liegt ein Gutschein für 1x Bibelteil + Infomaterial und ein Tütchen flavoured oil
252 2018-01-16 23:24:34 Would not advise anyone to wipe olbas oil in their eye

254 2018-01-16 23:24:28 @y1025fm @djaromaGH I don't have a bald head but my hair no dey grow well so ask them if the magic oil go fi help me
255 2018-01-16 23:24:28 @SalenaZito  ummmm, I dip Italian bread in olive oil with seasonings.   You should try it.
256 2018-01-16 23:24:13 He no change en oil before
257 2018-01-16 23:24:07 So ... if we all do our part and eat enough pizza, there'd be no need to worry about offshore oil drilling?
258 2018-01-16 23:23:47 Sometimes when I don't have time for pizza, I'll just take the oil straight up instead.
259 2018-01-16 23:23:42 going to walmart: WELL YOU COULD GET RAPED

going to get oil changed: BUT RAPE THO

going to mcdonalds: RAPED BY IMMIGRANTS!!!!

taking a shit in your own bathroom: A GUY COULD BREAK INTO YOUR HOUSE AND RAPE!!!
260 2018-01-16 23:23:16 1000 to 10000 times less than from mining coal or pumping oil.  Kinda makes a bunny doubt your honesty
261 2018-01-16 23:23:11 Your carnival reporting backfired again. Trump is invincible. He could drink dirty motor oil and eat nails and still get a clean bill of health.
262 2018-01-16 23:23:11 I ain’t get no oil spill last night or at all today 
263 2018-01-16 23:23:04 i like cooking but when the oil goes snap crackle & pop i needa be fuckin ready to haul ass
264 2018-01-16 23:23:03 I love oil paint because i can actually make things look good. Unlike acrylic
265 2018-01-16 23:23:02 In back room enclaves croney capitalist groups will be meeting to form and support wind and solar companies.This will cost taxpayers billions to subsidize producing only 20 percent of our energy needs. Our rates will double. Burn Cape Breton coal , Alberta oil and NB natural gas.
266 2018-01-16 23:22:54 Nope. Although the science says you can have up to 500 calories and still get the same effect. So every once in a while I'll eat a couple of Olives or something, if I'm hurting. But it has to be pure fat. Olives, mayo, butter or coconut oil in your coffee, etc
267 2018-01-16 23:22:51 What do you think $1,000 can buy to make a difference in people's lives? Do you have any idea how much food & gas costs? Oil to heat a home? A college education? Who do you think you are kidding? Do you tell your children not to lie? Shameful
268 2018-01-16 23:22:48 $67 for an oil change and $20 for gas meaning I just put $87 in my car in one day. I’m pissed off at my own car for being a needy bitch.
269 2018-01-16 23:22:43 Wanting to have trains through the middle of migration routes, main traffickers of wildlife, bribery, disruptive oil exploration within National Parks. 
The last two years China has been trying to show willing to prevent such destruction, too little, too late
270 2018-01-16 23:22:35 I went to take a sip of wine only to realize I picked up olive oil instead. #momlife
271 2018-01-16 23:22:22 Those crocodile tears!!  I imagine she was using everything she had not to laugh at his ham acting!
272 2018-01-16 23:22:19 Boiling in oil.
273 2018-01-16 23:21:58 Putting coconut oil on my face like its gonna cure 23 years of no sleep overnight 
274 2018-01-16 23:21:38 Look... Carla LISTEN. "They" (UNICEF, UN, you name it) are big oil (MAN). "WE" want to be pure water (Woman).  Oil is dead and wants water to die. But you won't listen to me. I'm not going to stop trying to make you. I was born for this.
275 2018-01-16 23:21:29 Girl snag some eucalyptus oil! It works wonders...also throwing in allergy medicine helps tons
276 2018-01-16 23:21:03 Wow! You just can't resist moving the goalposts and jumping topic to topic can you? Now you want to add political/foreign policy implications with oil/natural gas to CC? Amazing!
277 2018-01-16 23:20:59 "I guess telling you you look good for your age is pointless, huh?" His tone is light and teasing, his golden eyes sparkling as he picks up the oil. "You must hear that all the time."

284 2018-01-16 23:20:19 thought i was gonna have to pay $80 for an oil change for my car......

not only was the fee covered, they cleaned my car, inside and out, and replaced my wipers  

Thanks, @BMW @BMWUSA @BMWStratham #TeamBMW
285 2018-01-16 23:20:06 五限やだなぁ
286 2018-01-16 23:20:05 Fried sprouts are delish, had some yesterday. Roasted is good too. Kale is tasty just with garlic, oil and salt.
287 2018-01-16 23:19:51 Think about it qualitatively - people might be forward looking but that doesn't mean they'll predict a giant oil find in Saudi Arabia or the birth of the internet, or a billion other economically transformative things that will make their expectations way off track.

436 2018-01-16 23:00:00 The Fake Media obviously never went to Norway because if they did, they would soon discover that it is as much a sh*thole as any other sh*thole except it’s a more luxurious sh*thole. Sitting on a sea of Oil can make everyone a sh*thead. Oil reach Arab countries are point in case
437 2018-01-16 22:59:58 @exxonmobil Oh well. Trump usually sides with big oil.  At least you still have Trump on your side in every other way possible.
438 2018-01-16 22:59:54 My impossible dream. No Democrats in Congress.
439 2018-01-16 22:59:47 I used oil...
440 2018-01-16 22:59:47 Amazing how some of these groups defending Nutella for using palm oil don’t disclose they take their salary money from huge palm oil companies.  Highly unethical!
441 2018-01-16 22:59:43 @realDonaldTrump Invade Norway! They have oil.
442 2018-01-16 22:59:34 Lmao doooo not pour water onto your windshield. Its Russian roulette. Turn the car on give the oil a few minutes to warm up and give it a little rev-up. Turn defrost on and wait. A little bit of patience won't cost you a windshield. Cheers
443 2018-01-16 22:59:32 This oil cleanse thing is really clearing up my skin and I'm BLOWN. If I would've known it would work like this I would've started way earlier 
444 2018-01-16 22:59:06 Oh it's got olive oil in. A considerable amount. Hence the glossy sheen on it.
445 2018-01-16 22:58:55 Any anti liberal oil? I need need place a large order.
446 2018-01-16 22:57:31 My skin is so dry that I'm pretty sure it laughs every time I grab my coconut oil
447 2018-01-16 22:57:28 Sounds nice, but where's the oil or fat content ?
I find many flavours are oil soluble and so need that to infuse properly.

450 2018-01-16 22:56:53 I would be curious to hear more about the correlation between Islam and Crude Oil. Will their failed ideology collapse someday like the Soviet Union did or worse?
451 2018-01-16 22:56:46 This year we drinking more water and using more coconut oil
452 2018-01-16 22:56:40 If they are, you can get cbd oil easy anyway!
453 2018-01-16 22:56:34 Who was Oscar Perez #oscarperez A patriot, a terrorist there will be strong views on both sides. What did Oscar want? BALANCE IN VENEZUELAN GOVT. He was not aligned with the left or right. In a country that has the largest oil reserves in the world people can not buy basic food
454 2018-01-16 22:56:28 Tire and A oil change  oh I need a dude I hate having to get my car fixed
455 2018-01-16 22:56:27 Me: *puts castor oil carefully on the bases of my eyelashes*
This shit: *SMEARS ON A HALF OF MY FACE*
456 2018-01-16 22:56:07 Wow! Are you using coconut oil to cook in now?
457 2018-01-16 22:56:04 they notice i have a picture someone might actually enjoy looking at & their brain gets stuck there. "stop digging, you've struck oil!"
458 2018-01-16 22:56:00 one of my friends just sent a text in our group chat saying oil and nothing else i am confusion
459 2018-01-16 22:55:47 "warm spoons of oil" sounds so good. I don't think that was their intention, was it?  P.S. Get well soon!
460 2018-01-16 22:55:39 @redrobinburgers why are you no longer offering oil & vinegar for salad dressing? This makes it much harder for me to go here.
461 2018-01-16 22:55:39 @SenatorBurr for God sakes, keep our beautiful coast of NC drill free of oil. Why not windmills? Tom Tillis
462 2018-01-16 22:55:23 Coconut oil
463 2018-01-16 22:55:21 What a bunch of carpet baggers! And snakeskin oil peddlars. Hate them all - they're the "new age" equivalent of ambulance chasers!!
464 2018-01-16 22:55:15 @BJP4India @bjp4delhi BJP चुटिए logon ki party hai
465 2018-01-16 22:55:11 Reckon you could save on letters here and drop "salesman" and "oil" and it would be more than accurate.
466 2018-01-16 22:55:11 Absolutely we have too... Get these dems out
467 2018-01-16 22:55:09 Lessons while teaching a student driver.
Changing the oil should be lesson #2
468 2018-01-16 22:55:04 All i needed was an oil change.. now my baby running brand new
469 2018-01-16 22:55:01 Cant breathe and am pure teasing myself looking at all the olbas oil shit i can get
470 2018-01-16 22:54:49 Someone told one of our drive thru workers that she could use Castrol oil to fix her split ends
471 2018-01-16 22:54:39 Better skin by maybelline. Oil free
472 2018-01-16 22:54:13 you know you’re an adult when you happy cry about saving $130+ on new tires and an oil change
473 2018-01-16 22:54:00 Great! Now States need to start sueing big oil for polluting & clean up of the land, water,& air. All the needed Health Care caused by their pollution.
474 2018-01-16 22:53:46 Some oil gas mix
475 2018-01-16 22:53:41 wow just learned that you should NOT have your salt lamp and oil defuser on at the same time stay woke ladies
476 2018-01-16 22:53:39 It should be a primary national security strategy of the United States to make oil prices as low as possible by pursuing a carbon-free domestic economy. The military branches should be following the civilians on this, not leading as they have been doing. 
477 2018-01-16 22:53:30 Color of gold. Miracle oil ! 今夜もたっぷり… Francehttps://www.instagram.com/p/BeBx5_GFcwG/
478 2018-01-16 22:53:15 Me too. I don’t want to consume oil if I don’t have to.
479 2018-01-16 22:53:01 Sure this "snake oil scam" already made many people financially free. And they would not be without Bitcoin.
480 2018-01-16 22:52:56 Y todo eso gastando el gas oil que supuestamente es carísimo
481 2018-01-16 22:52:56 coconut oil. Or castor oil. Whichever rocks my boat really. But they both work wonders. 
482 2018-01-16 22:52:41 #HouseofSaud Saudi Arabia is where extremist Islam comes from & is funded by the house of Saud. The Saudi's are just ISIS who have a oil deal with the west.
483 2018-01-16 22:52:41 ก็ยังดีที่พอจะนึกถึงกันอยู่บ้าง
484 2018-01-16 22:52:29 It’s all about oil.
485 2018-01-16 22:52:28 Use coconut oil then wash ur face with ur regular wash
486 2018-01-16 22:52:16 Have any of you guys ever put castor oil on your lashes? Should I do that???
487 2018-01-16 22:52:02 @JOHNROBLOX21 Just wanted to let you know that I unfairly got perm banned from R2DA because I was "noclipping". I wasn't hacking or exploiting, I just got hit by a ticker and got glitched into a fuel tank on the oil rig map.
488 2018-01-16 22:51:34 good l'oreal Paris extraordinry oil i use brtween the palms of my hands, i like and the smell is amazing so yeah i buy again because is useful!!
489 2018-01-16 22:51:19 Awesome!!!
490 2018-01-16 22:51:06 If you want really soft hair do a hot coconut and argan oil mask 11/10 would recommend
491 2018-01-16 22:51:05 If you know anything about cracking rock you'll know that it is not a precise art. & if that crack is in the wrong place it's over.

There's nothing unfounded about that.

I said that I wanted guarantees. Not the usual Oil Crowd saying the same old rubbish that polluted America.
492 2018-01-16 22:50:52 Thinking of kroll show “ OLiVe OiL!”
493 2018-01-16 22:50:44 Ha ha! Did I see an oil tank pass here on a van last week?
494 2018-01-16 22:50:29 Three existing Kurdish presence countries, all have somewhat different agendas 
For example Iraqi Kurds depend on Turkey for oil revenue and thus provide intelligence on PKK and SDF
Not a uniform nation 
Never mind the fact that some are Shia or even Christians, not Sunni
495 2018-01-16 22:50:24 It was in a poor state long before 2016. 2016 might be the year the oil tanker began to turn
496 2018-01-16 22:50:19 Neutrogena, oil free moisturizer. After I was my face, I spray Mario Badesco facial spray then apply the moisturizer.
497 2018-01-16 22:50:14 Synthetic oil ain’t no whore!
498 2018-01-16 22:50:10 Likewise 
499 2018-01-16 22:50:03 Nothing better than using a face cleanser and tea tree oil after a long dayy
500 2018-01-16 22:50:03 I don’t want to be dependent on foreign oil either. Went through that in the ‘70’s. NEVER AGAIN! Trump should have never exempted Florida either.
501 2018-01-16 22:49:53 Boil oil
502 2018-01-16 22:49:45 it's backed by oil and blood. the USD is worthless without the petrodollar.
503 2018-01-16 22:49:32 I know what you mean! Im glad you got oil! Thank god!
504 2018-01-16 22:49:27 That may be right. As @LeifWenar 's work shows, dictatorships with oil don't even try to have a credible illusion of substantive governance, because their Citizens as a tax base are unnecessary/superflous to an oil-rich dictator. Jeg sender gjerne en kopi av boka hans, blod-olje!
505 2018-01-16 22:49:25 All my braids, dreads, sew ins. This plus wild growth oil keeps me clean & moisturized. Minimal itching. Scalp super clean
506 2018-01-16 22:49:08 For the oil reserves ....500 years of.

509 2018-01-16 22:48:43 Oil. Prices. Will. Drop. Due. Electric. Vehicles!
510 2018-01-16 22:48:27 She’s 12.....the idiocy is the people who take it as gospel truth
511 2018-01-16 22:48:18 Uncomfortable? You don't know uncomfortable until a guy is fucking you with a condom on and using an oil based lube.
512 2018-01-16 22:47:50 They were both snake oil salesmen and deeply flawed people.
513 2018-01-16 22:47:47 I need to oil my scalp. Lol
514 2018-01-16 22:47:42 Yeah! Just toss them in skillet with some olive oil instead of boiling. The texture is so much better.
515 2018-01-16 22:47:32 Just came for an Oil change, nothing more
516 2018-01-16 22:47:00 Olive oil with basil and garlic... Damn, I just ate and now I want pizza.
517 2018-01-16 22:46:45 don't need regime change need reforms to be put in place spend on the middle east policy needs to be reduced a lot oil revenue must benefit  Iranian people

519 2018-01-16 22:46:35 Its class, they had an oil rig here few years back n i thought the shipyard workers had built the cranes a metal christmas tree  but its lovely my wee boy lives going a drive down to the shipyard n see all the boats etc.
520 2018-01-16 22:46:32 What do u see for gbp/usd and usd/jpy please?
521 2018-01-16 22:46:31 Haha, well, my sauce is just the basic recipe honestly: 

Heat olive oil in the pan
Sauté chopped garlic clove
Add processed canned plum tomatos+juices
Add tomato paste
Salt/sugar/Basil/Bay leaf
522 2018-01-16 22:46:30 i need a good, weightless, oil free moisturizer with SPF 30+ in it.
523 2018-01-16 22:46:20 Need to oil my joints again. I swear, sometimes I feel like the tin man from the wizard of oz =A=
524 2018-01-16 22:45:26 Can I just bathe in coconut oil?
525 2018-01-16 22:45:22 Is that why crude oil is rising as well, a rising dollar as well as decreasing inventories?
526 2018-01-16 22:45:16 hijo e mil putas, pagamos el gas oil mas caro q en europa, q esta 40 centavos de euro
527 2018-01-16 22:44:59 My oil changes on my Jeep are so expensive 
528 2018-01-16 22:44:58 And honey, edible chocolate massage oil that heats up, is where it’s at. Thank me later.
529 2018-01-16 22:44:50 Like I already said, it might be petty to worry about a little excess tree when we gotta deal with oil companies destroying the earth at will, but at the same time, it’s worth it for the individual to check oneself and control how much they consume
530 2018-01-16 22:44:49 thx @plathitude! It's crazy! There's no snow on the ground so don't know what the difficulty is. Just saw an oil delivery truck drive past - I should go flag them down! What if this happened while I was away last week? FROZEN PIPES!  #heatingoil #Brrr
531 2018-01-16 22:44:42 A woman can not be trusted if she does not have one or all of the following: raw shea, cocoa butter, coconut oil, rose water....
532 2018-01-16 22:44:39 I’m watching this terrible American war hero movie while I figure out if want to douse my face in tea tree oil or just cry.
533 2018-01-16 22:44:22 #ProhibitionFacts: Federal Agents would go undercover to uncover illegal sale of alcohol. They were known to drink olive oil or sour cream just before going on duty- which were thought to be home remedies to stifle the effects of booze they would have to taste on duty.
534 2018-01-16 22:44:05 Red onion, yellow pepper, half courgette, few mushrooms, cook in a bit of olive oil, add Italian herbs & seasoning, tin tuna, tin chopped tomatoes, handful fresh basil, load of cooked pasta, cheese to cover and oven bake..
535 2018-01-16 22:43:52 No oil makes them try harder
536 2018-01-16 22:43:52 I just ordered new oil painting supplies. It will be the first time in 15 years that I’ll work a canvas. #rememberingwhoIam
537 2018-01-16 22:43:49 In the world I come from the price of oil was very high in the prophecy and price of booze was low.
538 2018-01-16 22:43:48 Okay because people keep asking:
Hair renewal and upkeep mask
Coconut oil (the solid kind) and tea tree oil, rub both together in your hands and spread scalp to ends. Let sit for 30 mins (enough time to make and eat some ramen ) and wash out in shower. Every other day.
539 2018-01-16 22:43:36 Yeah, except the war was just an excuse to steal another nations natural resources based on made up WMD.  Sending American kids to die for oil seemed a bad idea to me.
540 2018-01-16 22:43:20 Westminster has held back scots economy for decades to discourage nat support,on the quiet of course,in 40 years they have bankrupted an oil rich UK,,think about that,scots are surrounded by oil and gas yet we have foodbanks! Will England ever stand on its own feet?
541 2018-01-16 22:43:19 Give me oil in your lamp.. just been remenising ) can you still get the books one was blue then the modern green one with from the tiny ant?
542 2018-01-16 22:43:10 "The whitest and craziest things in the world cannot be ingested or even pursued - they must be kissed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
543 2018-01-16 22:42:53 Were will you get your water,fish,oil,gas from? dig it up in WM car park?
544 2018-01-16 22:42:52 Going LIVE in Midnight Ministry-The Midnight Minister in 5mins-“The Oil!”
545 2018-01-16 22:42:42 his blood is vegetable oil.
546 2018-01-16 22:42:35 Rolls his eyes, "I know I have a baby face and all, but this isn't my first time, you know."

He goes with a lavender-scented oil to counter the sandalwood incense and gets to work, starting up by the man's shoulders and slowly working his way down and out, away from his spine.
547 2018-01-16 22:42:30 Coconut oil that's a few months out of date should be fine to use on skin, right?
It doesn't look any different.
548 2018-01-16 22:42:26 Shouldn’t these people be completely exhausted by now?
549 2018-01-16 22:42:21 Yeah it’s rough. I switched from smoking cigarettes to vaping and the oil has little to no tobacco. Took one day at a time and kept busy when I could.
550 2018-01-16 22:42:19 Shout out to the lady whose car is burning oil like a bombed WWII destroyer.
Opening the passenger door is totally the answer...
551 2018-01-16 22:42:11 Any upward movement in global oil prices will have a positive impact on the economies of oil-producing countries like #Trinidad&Tobago & #Venezuela.

H/ever, #political instability in Venezuela will slow down the exp positive fiscal impact.
552 2018-01-16 22:42:03 CBD (cannibidiol) oil which is essentially non-psychoactive cannabis oil (doesn't make you high) is a godsend for anxiety, nausea, PTSD, chronic pain, and epilepsy. If you suffer from these conditions and nothing else works for you, get a medical cannabis prescription.
553 2018-01-16 22:41:55 Sir, there was a technology in the 1950's that could have saved billions of pounds of pollution if it hadn't of been banned. it would have saved gas & oil, too.
554 2018-01-16 22:41:53 He has got oil?
555 2018-01-16 22:41:37 @WaddleandSilvy Silvy, you do know that mayo and miracle whip or two different things. Miracle whip is laden with sugar were as mayo is just egg yolks and oil, corn, canola or olive.
556 2018-01-16 22:41:35 i never put heat on it! and thanks for the tip w/ moroccan oil!! when it’s still wet or ??? i don’t want greasy hair so i am afraid
557 2018-01-16 22:41:34 Burning the midnight oil just to complete this research. Blerh 
558 2018-01-16 22:41:21 After paying $1500 in much-needed ramp repairs, I just got really, really excited that my car mechanic offered to change my oil for free. Am I an adult now?
559 2018-01-16 22:41:19 Met my biggest investor (some £6m+) today and discussed Ed’s presentation. We will now fully exclude fossil fuel related stocks. She was genuinely surprised that one of the funds, calling itself Ethical, would be invested in even the tiniest weeniest oil company. Time to change!
560 2018-01-16 22:41:11 I haven’t heard from nick in two days and I’m getting worried!! I don’t like that he works in the oil field
561 2018-01-16 22:41:09 Rex TilkersonTop ExxonMobil CEO  OIL ESTABLISHMENT REP.A DEMOCRAT and continually wants Pres.Trump to keep bad deal with Iran.HE IS IN ADMINSTRATION BASED ON OIL BY CONDELISSA RICE/BUSH /CHANEY REFERRAL.TRUMP WAS VERY MISLEAD.I pray President Trump realizes who is around him
562 2018-01-16 22:41:02 Tea Tree oil makes my face feel so good
563 2018-01-16 22:40:49 they're not gonna need an oil change for 6000 miles after this one
564 2018-01-16 22:40:39 Loving the Sumo on NHK (Sky 507) this is all the fault of some mad Japanese engineers I worked with when rebuilding offshore oil wells in Khafji who took the time to explain this mad sport to this shinnichi. 
565 2018-01-16 22:40:35 armand sr. was like a super rich oil tycoon and he tried to buy the entire company that owns arm & hammer just bc he got tired of people asking about the name (they wouldn't sell but he did become a partner. ALL BECAUSE OF A PUN)
566 2018-01-16 22:40:32 Came home to oil down!!! If you’re reading this rn you’re a peasant to me and can’t talk to me...I FEEL LIKE A KING!!! 
567 2018-01-16 22:40:22 あ！何かガスマスクつけた白い鳥がいるぞ！待てー！
568 2018-01-16 22:40:15 It sucks that I react to essential oils in products. Every product I have wanted to try lately has one or more essential oil in it. If I use products with essential oils in it my skin breakout and I get a lot of texture.
569 2018-01-16 22:40:10 You know of anyone who uses groundnut oil?
570 2018-01-16 22:40:09 サラダ油に流されて変わってゆく私をあなたは時々遠くで叱って。
571 2018-01-16 22:39:54 including agricultural and forestry land, the territorial seabed, rights 
oil water electricity food we are more than self sufficient.
572 2018-01-16 22:39:50 i think today is the first time i've used oil in my hair that didn't completely fuck it up
573 2018-01-16 22:39:29 @steltenpower What do you think, is it possible for cities/governments in Europe to sue oil companies over climate change, too? Asking for my friends in the Netherlands and Northern Germany (among other regions).
574 2018-01-16 22:39:22 Beard oil helps
575 2018-01-16 22:38:55 Tea tree oil actually cures dandruff as it's an antifungal. Mixed with peppermint oil it's incredibly soothing. Tea tree and peppermint are meant to be together.
576 2018-01-16 22:38:51 OIL DIFF: 5.51 -> 5.53
577 2018-01-16 22:38:34 @Chelsea: hydrolized castor oil. Retonic acud. Htdrolurinic acid and processed skin cell proteins.
578 2018-01-16 22:38:32 I question that fair share term which is a Bernie-ite's quoting or emulating their dear leaders's rhetoric. You've fallen for his snake oil salesmen crap. It's not reasonable to give people money when they refuse to work. don't but it. Should be limits on free money .
579 2018-01-16 22:38:19 Filter may have been the wrong word... I'm so digital these days.

781 2018-01-16 22:11:37 I agree there was populist movement under guise of socialism that led to nationalization of Venezuela's oil industry that got rid of competition but then also when oil prices tanked in last couple years there was no other industry to prop up country and thus inflation resulted.

859 2018-01-16 22:00:08 LA lawsuit, like NYC's might expose that both cities pay no attention to #refrigeration coil cleaning which contributes to indirect GHG emissions - we tried to get both on board. LA has additionally regulated oil production within LA and never shut it down.

865 2018-01-16 21:59:17 Thank you!!!
866 2018-01-16 21:59:13 Which is better, Cocoa butter or coconut oil?
867 2018-01-16 21:59:04 YES GIRLLLLLLL! everything in there is awesome. that oil based cleanser is my holy grail product, i just had to switch to their deep cleanse cleanser tho because i have lash extensions and i cant use oil based cleansers.
868 2018-01-16 21:58:56 I hope your oil heating is working!
869 2018-01-16 21:58:54 Yes, but the USD is the only currency that has a monopoly on the pricing of oil and other critical commodities.  If other nations print the money for their entitlements, they won't hyperinflate the worlds commodity import bill by doing so like the USA will.
870 2018-01-16 21:58:52 Very good, but need to work for real setups and more precision damage oil temp and blow tires in simulation mode same iRacing. I think is possible to have simulation and causual mode for all people want to play next game ! Possible? Thanks Sean and happy new year
871 2018-01-16 21:58:47 Oil and gas wells commonly produce water along with the oil and gas. Known as produced water, the water is usually highly saline, and must be disposed of by injecting it into EPA-permitted Class II water disposal wells.
872 2018-01-16 21:58:46 Is there something wrong with me that this doesn't move the needle? 3T of warm oil isn't horrible.
873 2018-01-16 21:58:46 @politicalham If Canada’s Feds are looking for revenue from Alberta’s pipeline’s downhill emissions, shouldn’t they be looking for the same from imported oil to maintain a level playing field?
874 2018-01-16 21:58:37 Best oil I’ve ever tasted.
875 2018-01-16 21:58:20 What Would Be REALLY Fun Is For Every Current TV Show To Take A Group Selfie Of Their Writer's Room Staff So We Could See Who's Being Inclusive & Who Needs An Oil Change For Their DeLorean So They Can Leave 1975.

877 2018-01-16 21:57:39 Hi Amanda. Our popcorn, popping oil, popcorn salt and buttery topping are all vegan and gluten-free. We are unsure about soy, but we are asking our Popcorn Team now. :)
878 2018-01-16 21:57:27 @JASONMOMOA_TH We love your acting and are so excited by reports that Aquaman will tackle pollution & other ocean issues. We would love to see you publicly criticize Trump's reckless offshore oil drilling plan & we'd be honored to help you place a newspaper oped on the subject.
879 2018-01-16 21:57:27 @realDonaldTrump is a well known racist, fascist, sexist, serial sexual assaulter, a grabber, a liar, a charlatan, a snake oil salesman, a traitor, a Russian operative, & a Putin lapdog in the White House. His presidency was & still is based on pure racism & bigotry.
880 2018-01-16 21:57:13 Finally getting round to starting the first chapter of my project. Coming up with an interesting and unique plot was so difficult but now I think I am ready to begin. Bring forth the keyboard and the midnight oil. #writing #fiction #novelproject #CreativeNetwork.com

885 2018-01-16 21:56:24 By 2050 there will be 2 billion electric cars on the road . Hence why the Dems say work on new technology not drill for oil !
886 2018-01-16 21:56:24 Here’s a helpful tip when cooking kale: use coconut oil. That way, it makes it easier to scrape into the trash.
887 2018-01-16 21:56:08 Need look no further than the oil gulf Nations that are "Western allies". Deflecting won't help.
888 2018-01-16 21:55:55 I prefer @Skippy natural; it’s delicious and very little oil separation. No gritty feeling and it’s a little sweet. It’s the only natural one I can eat.
889 2018-01-16 21:55:52 Oh my goodness. I’m so excited. I’ve never had rose Oil before.  
890 2018-01-16 21:55:32 And each class will be accompanied by a tablespoon of Cod Liver Oil, because we deem it to be good for you!
891 2018-01-16 21:55:23 I did something a little different though and heated up some olive oil beforehand and placed the salmon skin down to make it crispy before putting it in the oven. Badass decision because it came out delicious.
892 2018-01-16 21:55:20 he'll have an oil painting in his attic to the contrary,...

896 2018-01-16 21:54:57 it is good baked into chips and good if fried in oil for a minestrone type soup but otherwise
too much too much
897 2018-01-16 21:54:54 LNG is not where our dollars should be invested
Its a dying industry
As is oil
Building this infrastructure will not make it a commodity anyone wants 
It's a short sighted bad bet
898 2018-01-16 21:54:38 Putin killed an entire family today, he gets oil contracts and to run a country, it also doesn't get reported! Not taking away how bad the story is just an injustice on the flip side
899 2018-01-16 21:54:28 This is important because, if these chemicals do not bio-degrade in about 1 year or so they will build up in our groundwater so much that they get into the local aquifers.

So answer the question Oil Man

910 2018-01-16 21:51:14 It’s way too heavy. Try 100% jojoba oil + add a couple drops of tea tree or lavender to treat breakouts
911 2018-01-16 21:50:56 A) Yes. But I'm gocho, so it's irrelevant.
B) It's even more irrelevant.
C) Oil was being sold at up to >140$/baril in 2010-2012. Last government before your favourite putschist sold it as low as 8$baril. It was tough then, but there was no humanitarian crisis.
912 2018-01-16 21:50:53 Just used so much bath oil that my house now smells like a lavender field and the bath is more slippery than an ice rink 
913 2018-01-16 21:50:52 Money's just a social construct that we created originally because gold was shinier than anything else. No other species has given value to inanimate and useless objects (though one can argue that the oil standard replaced the gold standard because we're slaves to fossil fuels).
914 2018-01-16 21:50:50 #AQMDChatter - Listening into the working group about second wave of rules to dismantle the RECLAIM program - the South Coast's cap and trade program. Lots of Air District staff and folks from the oil and gas industry.

936 2018-01-16 21:47:33 You can try to disconnect the disk and reconnect it. I remember still the fan on the processor was cleaning and lubricating with oil. Another computer was on the table. but now he's lying down.
937 2018-01-16 21:47:29 Time to send her a Dm for her address and send the movie and an autographed picture.  Like a big oil painting for the house and a small wallet size so she will be able to tell you apart from all the numerous South Asian men on TV.
938 2018-01-16 21:47:05 Put more olive oil in my ear. Itchy banter
939 2018-01-16 21:46:56 86,000 gallons/year of oil seep naturally from the Santa Barbara Channel.
940 2018-01-16 21:46:44 We tend to think that humility is important, but not all that fun. In reality, humility makes work more enjoyable, play more serious, relationships more harmonious--even humor becomes richer. Humility is to life what oil is to an engine.
941 2018-01-16 21:46:43 I should probably get my oil changed this weekend.
942 2018-01-16 21:46:38 MR VICE PRESIDENT IF WE ARE TO INSURE PEACE OF THE FUTURE SO NATIONS DO NOT WAR FOR OIL OR GAS! WE MUST CONCENTRATE OUR EFFORTS ON RENEWABLES TO GROW NOT JUST  FOR NATIONS ;BUT HUMANITY
943 2018-01-16 21:46:37 $150 for an oil change

947 2018-01-16 21:45:56 I keep hearing this phrase "Data is the new oil"...which is true in the sense that if you don't refine it you're left with a crude opaque mess.
948 2018-01-16 21:45:52 Not bad , seems to be slowly recovering from oil slump who j is good.  Tons of building going by on with new bypass , new aecc etc

964 2018-01-16 21:44:01 Worldwide agricultural land used by oil palm is a mere 5%. It is an unfair and double standard and it is merely an economic move. Protectionist.
965 2018-01-16 21:43:42 The U.K. said had said they recognise the referendum of 1961 & the various arrangements for a unitied Cameroun. Note: the UK sold S. Cameroons to France especially when oil was discovered in Bakassi area in the 1970s. It rests on S. Cameroonians to take control of their future.

1034 2018-01-16 21:35:26 Most oil producers will make offers to buyout passive investors.  I used to invest in some of these and they always would.  At some point after decay it's worth giving up a 15% return when the checks get so small.

1142 2018-01-16 21:21:35 Not if the GOP has anything to say about it.  Coal, gas, oil, mining and poisons.
1143 2018-01-16 21:21:26 Note that gives him a BMI (under the outdated height v weight system) of 29.9: the razor edge of “overweight” rather than “obese”
1144 2018-01-16 21:21:22 オリーブ油は、毎朝やっているテレビ番組のコーナーでも使っていたりするよね♪
1145 2018-01-16 21:21:01 I know exactly what oil is and that it contains hydrocarbons. However what you said was hydrocarbons and other pollutants being extracted from underground creates carbon dioxide.
1146 2018-01-16 21:20:51 Aloe/olive oil as conditioner/ twist out with coconut oil before washing 
Thambisa icoconut oil 
Dry with old t-shirt not a towel and air dry (no heat) 
Wash with black African soap
1147 2018-01-16 21:20:41 Yeah, it's like dumb eco-terrorists attacking logger work-sites, or oil riggers or whatever. You're not hurting the big companies, you're just hurting the person who wants to take care of their loved ones and family
1148 2018-01-16 21:20:29 Tired of having a noisy oil heater that constantly needs a refill. Any HVAC recommendations?
1149 2018-01-16 21:20:20 Notice in dystopian films, future people are still fighting over oil/gas and not over windmills, solar energy. Renewables can't even solve the energy crisis in works of fiction.
1150 2018-01-16 21:20:17 My boyfriend took my car to get an oil change if that ain’t the most old married couple thing idk what is
1151 2018-01-16 21:19:56 1.  Wash with organics shampoo and conditioner 
2. Comb out hair from the tip to the root with conditioner in and make twists
3. Rinse out conditioner with twists in
4. Untwist and apply natural coconut oil from Clicks from the root to the tip
1152 2018-01-16 21:19:53 MCT oil doesn’t solidify.....
1153 2018-01-16 21:19:52 He will outlive some of them that are much younger. Got to be deflating for them.   #MAGA
1154 2018-01-16 21:19:32 Also imagine the Region where fishing is meant to be the major occupation but devastation of the environment through oil exploration is a highly prevailing activity. 
In such areas, inflation is mad! Even most non-perishables arrive there from Lagos.
1155 2018-01-16 21:19:20 You have to oil that scalp too. Whether you use grease, cream or oil. It’s your preference, but make sure your scalp stays moisturized.
1156 2018-01-16 21:19:19 And avocado . Coconut oil and avocado. No parsnip, too many carbs.
1157 2018-01-16 21:19:19 Oil!

1159 2018-01-16 21:18:58 Is car oil like KY jelly for robots?
1160 2018-01-16 21:18:58 Dirty,evil,corrupt &all created and funded by UK & US our Monarchy rubs shoulders wi theirs. Whtwe gonna do when oil runs out? #HouseofSaud
1161 2018-01-16 21:18:57 Peanut oil or my personal favorite is bacon grease
1162 2018-01-16 21:18:26 Getting an oil change—usually awful but I’m listening to the amazing @babesbooksbeers (there’s a chance i’m on this week’s ep )
1163 2018-01-16 21:18:24 Yep. Yep. Breaking out the coconut oil talk.
1164 2018-01-16 21:17:52 Thanks for the clarification TShields. Anyway, oil production in the US is rocking.
1165 2018-01-16 21:17:46 I’d like to challenge him to take that tone and line of questioning with me just once
1166 2018-01-16 21:17:37 Got to be disappointing for them. On track to live to 100 or more. 
1167 2018-01-16 21:17:32 I don't think weed kills though. Not defending pot just saying. I don't smoke weed but I hear the oil does wonders.
1168 2018-01-16 21:17:16 So because of your misfortune, you want to see others lose what they have? You in the oil industry talking about “cry me a river?” Go buy another pickup.
1169 2018-01-16 21:17:08 So bad luck just keeps flowing my way , car is in the garage after hitting black ice , been quoted £400 minimum  run out oil so I have no heating no hot water , and now I have no car til it's fixed means I might have to sell my inglorious ticket ! My birthday is going to suck
1170 2018-01-16 21:17:08 Q4 #EarningsSeason should be another good one. #SPX consensus operating earnings (+12% YoY) likely a few percentage points too low, in line with historical upside, given recent economic surprises, strong manufacturing data, higher oil prices, weak dollar, and rising estimates.
1171 2018-01-16 21:16:57 Foreign stocks generally up; not US: Europe +.1%; US -.4%. Lower oil prices & uncertainty over government shutdown wiped out strong early rally. Perhaps some very short-term volatility before market turns higher in medium-term.
1172 2018-01-16 21:16:56 Hold up so youre trynna say that in this situation where even if naina asks him to oil his hair he should without asking any questions SAMEER LEGIT SAID MAI BALOON MAI TAIL NAHE DAALTA SUIT NAHE KARTA  I LOVE THIS GUY

1175 2018-01-16 21:16:34 What we also need to put in perspective about the 24/30$ bn is that a large portion is eaten up by the state sector salaries (& that this number equates assuming a uniform production with no party disrupting #oil field production/no war surrounding the oil crescent). #Libya
1176 2018-01-16 21:16:01 Eyes bulging and seemed very angry. 
Maybe a mental exam is in order?
1177 2018-01-16 21:15:52 Warm olive oil for a few days should do it. Or Otex is good too
1178 2018-01-16 21:15:49 Much nicer than warm oil any day.
1179 2018-01-16 21:15:48 A Presidential Combine would be a ratings blockbuster. Wonderlic, 40 against Rich Eisen, and two laps around Lucas Oil Stadium. Michelle Obama wins going away.

1181 2018-01-16 21:15:32 Rose oil and coconut oil are LIFE 
1182 2018-01-16 21:15:25 Don’t bother asking for citations. He’ll just give you a link to some bunk oil Corp propaganda website
1183 2018-01-16 21:15:09 There's that 99% Invisible episode about how McDonald's used to cook fries in tallow instead of vegetable oil.
1184 2018-01-16 21:15:03 Come home from work to a freezing house to find out mum has ran out of oil............its only about -13 outside 
1185 2018-01-16 21:15:01 Deep conditioning and hot oil treatment
1186 2018-01-16 21:14:57 A tale of two nations
Uk
Norway
Both had sudden access to north sea oil wealth.
The UK decided to use it for short-term tax breaks and pretend the economy was booming.
Norway invested the revenue.
Its sovereign wealth fund is now worth $1 trillion dollars
1187 2018-01-16 21:14:40 Use Argon oil  
Or add 3 drops of tea tree oil, works too.
1188 2018-01-16 21:14:21 They have to be fresh and tender but still firm to slice, once trimmed from woody outsider leafs and part, peel the part of the stem still attached to them and slice the tender core very thin. Parsley, lemon juice, evo oil and touch of salt....   not for everybody but I love it
1189 2018-01-16 21:14:16 Those are also bad. Also note slavery is still allowed in some places in middle East. And minorities under Islamic theocracies don't do that well either btw. Saudi Arabia and opec nations control much of world oil production/sale. ...
1190 2018-01-16 21:14:13 Ha ha! Look how uncomfortable he is in a grocery store! Can someone oil the Tin Man please.

1194 2018-01-16 21:14:06 DO I LOOK LIKE I CAN CHANGE MY OWN FUCKING OIL
1195 2018-01-16 21:14:05 1. I came with my parents when they were transferred here when I was 17. I left my country when I was 10. My dad is in the oil bis so we traveled a lot. Anyway, the day I turned 18 I was illegal. Tell me, what would you do if this were to happen to you?
1196 2018-01-16 21:14:03 The good news is, what I assumed was a developing horrible ear infection looks to just be some irritation at a bad dry wax buildup. The bad news is I have to put oil in my ear and go back to get it washed. Yyyyyuck!

1198 2018-01-16 21:13:45 Just simply pan fried with a little spray oil
1199 2018-01-16 21:13:38 Regular. Fried chicken in the pan in oil and had the sauce made from Sunday. After all the chicken was fried, he added sauce and mozz and put it layered in the pan in the oven until the cheese and sauce was hot and melted
1200 2018-01-16 21:13:24 House of Saud controls one fifth of the world's oil supplies, but the country is in difficulties, in spite, or probably because of, the fabulous wealth of the elite.
1201 2018-01-16 21:13:12 Why use a crypto-currency for this? The coins are supposedly backed by barrels of oil but how would anyone collect?  Especially from a country that defaults on international loans or devalues its currencies as often as I lease a car...

1204 2018-01-16 21:13:03 The reality is that offshore drilling will not take place of the coast of Connecticut.  There's no oil under Long Island Sound.  That means it's no threat to the CT coastline or economy.  Why must you lie?
1205 2018-01-16 21:12:47 I wonder if this guy would paint an oil painting of Sisko punching Q... hmm... "God Beats Satan" vibe would really work.
1206 2018-01-16 21:12:44 Exactly. Yet a certain percentage of Americans are still buying his snake oil. Go figure.
1207 2018-01-16 21:12:28 Even palm oil! What kind of people are we in this nation? No wonder our leaders treat us the same

1209 2018-01-16 21:12:15 Went to Sears specifically for an alignment and this dummy changed my oil instead. I just changed it myself this morning 
1210 2018-01-16 21:12:10 3/ China & Russia understand that USD-only pricing will lead to the bankruptcy of their nations & starvation of their people as their USD oil import bill hyperinflates (in the case of China) or their UST pile becomes worthless in oil terms as USD oil hyperinflates (Russia).

1214 2018-01-16 21:11:47 I drink liquor I don't sip oil
1215 2018-01-16 21:11:46 Apparently when my ex was driving my car he cracked my oil pan & ripped off a good part of my skid plate on a speed bump.. engine almost ceased from lack of oil that is all over my driveway from said crack, the shit storm that is coming his way is not even remotely funny 
1216 2018-01-16 21:11:44 Steve Bannon was in the oil olive business with his father, but that was a Kong time ago.
1217 2018-01-16 21:11:44 Let's have a little friendly competition. Which state's beaches that are threatened by potential new oil drilling are the best? (Can only include 4 options so comment if we left out your favorite.)
1218 2018-01-16 21:11:27 Yup religion is nothing more than a cult of magick teachings... Pray for what you want... Rub this oil and meditate ... Burn that candle and respite these words.. divine within requires only belief.
1219 2018-01-16 21:11:27 Dude new markets means customer demanding products. Engineered Wood floors not tile, MBF shelving not steel or plastic , Carbon from trees not oil

1221 2018-01-16 21:11:26 By the way, I'd hate to have my health info out there so publicly.

1224 2018-01-16 21:10:41 A note to all you meal preppers and lifters, best way to prep chicken breast: coat in olive oil, s+p, and BROIL in a sheet pan 5 min or until just barely golden, flip each breast and return for 3 minutes. Pull them out and immediately wrap with foil. Wait 15 min before cutting up

(Not a fan of him, knew he would abandon us in NJ and go off to run for President,) but yeah this is good, and at least showing a united front with the new Governor and Reps against offshore NJ Oil drilling other day was good too.

1231 2018-01-16 21:09:55 Went for my first massage post baby with a male masseuse. Half way through I felt something round and hard poking me in the side... popped up disgusted about to have a #metoo moment ... then realized it was the bottle of oil in his pocket #notmetoo #carryon
1232 2018-01-16 21:09:52 My new oil is being delivered today, and I cant wait for my fresh retwist next week.
1233 2018-01-16 21:09:43 Compared to one year ago, the US is more dependent on foreign oil and investors, while the debt to China and Russia spiralled out of control. Being independent has nothing to do with gun control or the military.

1235 2018-01-16 21:09:27 2/ THAT is why China & Russia are shifting oil pricing away fr USD, why China's been going all around the world signing LT deals that amt to "You take the USD's, we'll take the oil."  Shorting USD's, buying oil.  This is already done, we're just waiting for it to be mkd-2-mkt :)

1242 2018-01-16 21:08:50 the biggest question in my mind: why on earth would *any* gaming company or existing endemic participate in this?

also the idea of having a cryptocurrency being pitched as a solution to transparency is some spectacular snake oil salesmanship

1244 2018-01-16 21:08:23 How would inflation affect flows? Inflation here, inflation in China, or increase in necessary commodity prices like oil? Was it notable that officially noted inflation rose in China pre 2008 crisis?

1251 2018-01-16 21:07:38 1/ Fr 1850-1973, OIL=GOLD (thru GBP, then USD).  Fr 1973-3q14, OIL=USD.  That's where the problem is.  USD was already destroyed by politicians in '33 (Soc Sec) & '68 (Medicare).  Those promised $100T+ in USD's, & remember USD=OIL.  $100T = ~60 yrs of 100% of global oil supplies.
1252 2018-01-16 21:07:37 oh yes. dont ever clean it just paint over all the dirt and oil hahahhaah

1276 2018-01-16 21:04:41 By burning coal, oil, and natural gas, humans are adding carbon dioxide ---- the atmosphere much faster than the carbon in rocks is released ---- natural processes. #geceanketi #prepositions #yds
1277 2018-01-16 21:04:27 I've never understood why the bigly push for destructive oil! Except the for the money!

I'm a child of the 60s & know damn well we could of been 80% + using solar!

1278 2018-01-16 21:04:14 Do not put butter or oil on the burns as it may trap heat &amp; cause burns to worsen. Instead hold the burnt area under cold running water.
1279 2018-01-16 21:04:08 As a matter of fact, I have done it, you lazy. 
Even when using official numbers only, they are overwhelmingly bad.
Even when oil was sold >100$/baril.
Do it yourself and open your mind.
Or keep on being lazy. And keep on failing to your duty of human compassion.

1287 2018-01-16 21:02:59 Just started following you. Is it necessary for the oil to contain THC?  My health food store sells CBD/hemp oil but don't know if they are as healthy. Thanks!

1288 2018-01-16 21:02:59 To every fuck whose parents got them a brand new car, he grateful that every time you get an oil change, the mechanics don't give you a list of 20 things that need to be done that would cost you a couple grand.
1289 2018-01-16 21:02:35 Enslavement of African Americans through the prison industrial complex. Death to the Middle East for oil. Installing foreign dictators. Colonialism.

I see a distinction, I'm just not entirely willing to declare one "worse". I definitely know which kills more people.

1294 2018-01-16 21:02:18 No way I make ours homemade! Use a good oil like coconut or avocado and you're all good!

1296 2018-01-16 21:02:04 And only being able to get olive oil for your salad from the local apothecarium.
1297 2018-01-16 21:01:50 I AGREE,
BUT IT IS NOT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IT IS THE U.S. AGENDA.THEY ARE DETABILIZING THE WORLD TRAYING TO RE START A NEW ERA !, EVERYTHING WILL DEPEND ON THE U.S. OIL DLL. COLAPSE ! BECAUSE AT THE END THE U.S. KNOW THAT THEY CREATE A FAKE ECONOMY THAT IS RISHING IT END !!!

1305 2018-01-16 21:00:52 @RenaultIndia 
I seriously believe that some design change should be considered to prevent damage to oil sump or change the material of da same.
1306 2018-01-16 21:00:45 Oil has practical value. Gold has psychological value. It won’t keep you warm. It was the first “agreed upon” unit of exchange. Now the usd has same status, plus potential for roi in convenient form.  Usd will destroyed by politicians. Not a China/Russia cabal. Imho
1307 2018-01-16 21:00:38 What happens in a global economy of today is that, while all those Congressmen (beholden to oil) are clinging to the past, the rest of the world see the obvious and are making the necessary adjustments for the future.  Fossil fuels will not paint the future of power.
1308 2018-01-16 21:00:23 Love Lavender: To ease stress and prepare for bed, soak in a hot bath spiked with a few drops of lavender essential oil. Play soothing music while you bathe to unwind further.
1309 2018-01-16 21:00:08 @potus @realDonaldTrump Dr Ronny Jackson, there are natural ways to lower LDL, such as taking 2 flax seed oil softgels after eating red meet.
1310 2018-01-16 20:59:58 He does.
All the oil and gas you own and he sells you should have much better roads, schools, hospitals, police, etc.
You don't have that because he wants to live better than you.
You are slave for him and he steals your gas and oil too.
1311 2018-01-16 20:59:39 Then dipped in more oil. With a side of chili oil. And, the other 6 slices. Thank you.
1312 2018-01-16 20:59:35 That is magic!  I've taken my car to Jensen Tire for as long as I could drive, and have always resigned myself to the fact that oil change = no car for like, a day.
1313 2018-01-16 20:59:34 Yep and the oil
1314 2018-01-16 20:59:13 Mate there gonna post up for an easy 2 into an advancing oil price, yes they have been utter shit but they are priced this way. I see all things change and the oil environment at $70+ a barrel will deliver a number of multibaggers across the junior markets. 

Lets see chief
1315 2018-01-16 20:58:57 @RenaultIndia 
Dear Team,
     I'm owning a duster and a kid vehicle. Well I don't have any complain about Duster. But kid I do. Especially because of foreign object damages to the plastic oil sump. I just checked online and found many cases of engine seizure because of this.
1316 2018-01-16 20:58:57 omg thanks so much! what face oil do you use?
1317 2018-01-16 20:58:43 #BroadBand is the new oil #Knowledgeeconomy is the new #Resources driving up the #GDP of countries. #SiliconValley has one of the highest reservoir of #Knowledgebased wealth in the world. #NaturalResources don’t make countries rich any longer, it is the #Brain that does it today.
1318 2018-01-16 20:58:40 Unfortunately @Gov_Martinez doesn’t seem to understand this. She is proposing new permit requirements for oil & gas wells that would be some of the weakest in the nation. Her proposal would do nothing to clean up the San Juan Basin methane hot spot #nmleg
1319 2018-01-16 20:58:38 @justinshenkarow if you see a show or a chef that gives recommendation for alternatives to onions or olive oil in recipes I’d appreciate it. I’m allergic to both.
1320 2018-01-16 20:58:34 yeap might be able to buy heating oil bill to keep warm this winter. But not going to happen that quickly O well... So far just another Campaign promise that has not happened for our nations Heros
1321 2018-01-16 20:58:27 Should incorporate sweet potatoes too if you haven't already. Blanche them, pan fry with coconut or olive oil and top with cinnamon.
1322 2018-01-16 20:58:18 Chez Bite we have a variety of oils and fats used for different purposes inc. your own :)

1324 2018-01-16 20:58:10 It didn’t yesterday but dad put more oil in it and it turned over so was able to move it
1325 2018-01-16 20:58:06 Tips I’ve discovered to help you through a bad cold/flu:

- Olive oil on cotton wool stuffed in your ears
- Add a few drops of Olbas Oil to a cup of boiling water (don’t drink, just leave in a room!)
- Wasabi snacks (nom nom)
- Hot compression on the bridge of one’s nose
1326 2018-01-16 20:58:01 brought Louie with me to get my oil changed and watching all these oil covered generally badass grown men crouch down to baby talk to my pup is making me weak
1327 2018-01-16 20:57:51 Buhari is a Nigeria meaning fraud which by origin a Fulani from Sudan whose task by British is ethnic cleansing of the indigenous people for displacement because of oil.

1329 2018-01-16 20:57:35 We can do better. New Mexico is now a top tier oil and gas producing state. We deserve a first class oil and gas regulatory system to match. #nmleg #cutmethane
1330 2018-01-16 20:57:32 I belief bus 920 has a bit of an oil leak. Holy fumes! Lesson time, then Camp Ulsh till around 8, and then I’m going to lift, can’t miss my 2nd day in. I’ll be home around 10 or so. Wake up do it again, but wouldn’t have it any other way!
1331 2018-01-16 20:57:29 Checking in to see UEN is up nicely. Huge scope for a large rise given current production and rises in oil price. Positioned to do very well.
1332 2018-01-16 20:57:23 I just want my oil changed. I don’t want to give you my life story nor do I need everything under the hood flushed and replaced. Just change the oil pal.

1335 2018-01-16 20:57:15 @KyleFergusson Burning Halo at 13 has some strange interactions.  Seems you can damage the same target twice with sword and body, but only body gets double damage after teleport.  Whole kit rewards you for teleporting at the last second like getting most out of Blaze's Oil Slick.
1336 2018-01-16 20:57:14 Use any hair oil like olive oil or coconut oil on damp hair. Applying oil or product on damp hair absorbs better.
1337 2018-01-16 20:57:01 It subsided at around 19 - 20 y/o once my facial hair started to grow in and I had to start shaving. I’m sure it was hormonal & bad teenage diet. But I think everyone suffers with oil deposits, and blocked pores until the day we die. #exfoliate
1338 2018-01-16 20:56:57 Amazing what a so called Christian will do for a paycheck. She's the reason ppl like me gave up on religion. A snake oil salesman like her boss. Also she should take off those darn pearls. She looks older than my grandmother (an Italian immigrant). At least my Nana had morals.

1346 2018-01-16 20:56:24 The oil and gas industry is pouring billions into new drilling projects in New Mexico. This investment remains critical, and it makes action to curtail #methane waste and pollution that much more critical to ensure that New Mexico reaps the full benefit of this boom. #nmleg

1354 2018-01-16 20:55:44 Site unseen: reasonable to question your impartiality, due to the oil reserves in your state?
1355 2018-01-16 20:55:43 Don't forget polluted water, oil drenched beaches, earthquakes due to fracking, and spills from pipe lines
1356 2018-01-16 20:55:21 If I change your mind, get you to advocate for nuclear energy and other solutions which get us more quickly off of oil, coal, and natural gas, then I've done my job.
1357 2018-01-16 20:55:18 Lol, yeah! My go-to routine is pretty simple. Wash my face w/ St. Ives fresh skin apricot face scrub for a good 45-60 seconds after every workout & before bed, then moisturize my face w/ tea tree oil. Boom.
1358 2018-01-16 20:55:12 Great win by @ashbar96 one down! #ausopen a bit of Ivan Drago about her opponent - very mechanical and needed an oil... every time she hit the ball, there was a creak. Possibly some WD40.
1359 2018-01-16 20:55:10 Afrin hoisting flags out of desperation whilst Jazira conspires with the americans to starve Syria of it's oil is not a good deal. All of "Rojava" needs to show more willingness to expel foreign actors not approved by Damascus out before any real action from Damascus is taken.

1363 2018-01-16 20:54:36 You don't see the difference in Oil prices now? And the subsidies which the Saudis give out as expansionists 
1364 2018-01-16 20:54:32 Venezuela : currency pegged to dollar because of oil. Oil price fell. Crude oil also so needs purifying ( costly) .Oil the only export. Everything is imported. Drought, corruption, sanctions. Black market. Dual exchange rates. Not a bit like UK -or anywhere.
1365 2018-01-16 20:54:28 Ran out oil. But no warning light or anything. It wouldn’t start yesterday. Going in for repair because the dipstick holder had broken off
1366 2018-01-16 20:54:24 Brexit, austerity, tories, 2 trillion nation debt. Scotland has no voice. England Trump every vote due to size. Mismanagement of Scottish oil wealth, msm bias, we want a government we vote for.
1367 2018-01-16 20:54:03 Ohww! Coconut oil would do the magic 
On other note, You have reminded me of paranthas now! 
1368 2018-01-16 20:54:01 Tbh I think the OHIO Small business deduction is helping more than the Federal tax law. Considering you people don't address a lot of small business are subject to self employment tax, which remained unchanged. 

You're selling snake oil here Robert
1369 2018-01-16 20:53:52 I think you have lied to me. You blamed the failure on the degraded oil. I have been advised that if the oil had degraded it should have shown up on the warning light. #misleading customers.
1370 2018-01-16 20:53:49 Except Venezuela was caused by a combination of fascism (in the guise of socialism) and tanking oil prices -- so not exactly the same situation.

1376 2018-01-16 20:53:15 Good to know their cream puffs are oil filled. I was eyeing those up but my seams screamed “NO!” But I bought focaccia bread at Mercato’s after being told it was fresh that morning. It was so stale it crumbled to powder when we tried to eat it that night. Unimpressed.
1377 2018-01-16 20:53:01 the guys always try to hustle me when I go get my oil changed 
1378 2018-01-16 20:52:59 If you understand oil, you can understand gold.  If you had an oilfield that was so big that when that big oilfield became exhausted, the subsequent rise in global oil prices would significantly haircut the value of all other global paper assets, you'd own some gold.  :)
1379 2018-01-16 20:52:58 We should have the technology now where that thing can be powered by the excess oil in your thumbs.

1385 2018-01-16 20:52:09 I got a random package from a family friend with essential oil in it...

The essential oil is cedar and my worst allergy is cedar.
1386 2018-01-16 20:52:03 And if there's a layer of solidified oil on top, it's like ice fishing.
1387 2018-01-16 20:52:01 Soo tired but no I need a oil change lol
1388 2018-01-16 20:51:57 The "#news" is YOU: you don't need some paid lying poisoning murdering swine to tell you what to think about pig A and pig B or the latest snake oil and carnivals that tune the rhythms of the masses
1389 2018-01-16 20:51:56 I seen it on Pinterest almost 3 years ago. I also dabble in essential oil products.
1390 2018-01-16 20:51:46 with a good blender it's possible! you might have to experiment a bit with the amount of oil/honey
1391 2018-01-16 20:51:35 Testat tea three oil?
1392 2018-01-16 20:51:25 What happens to our tourism industry when we allow rampant #methane pollution and unchecked, barely regulated oil and gas drilling? #nmleg
1393 2018-01-16 20:51:24 Norwegians also run their entire government on oil money. How about a different example?
1394 2018-01-16 20:51:14 Dobson is another version of Oral Roberts, Fallwell, Baker and Creflo Dollar: snake oil salesmen in it for vast sums of money by deceiving people with little money!
1395 2018-01-16 20:51:13 If there's so MUCH oil being produced, then why is the price per barrel continuing to climb on stock market? Basic Economics teach price should decline.
1396 2018-01-16 20:51:06 The World's largest impact crater.

Well, no-one has ever Questioned their formation. So, no need to put forward a theory.

1400 2018-01-16 20:50:44 Venezuela collapsed financially not because it was socialist based but because the value of oil plummeted. Their entire economy was based upon the price of one commodity.
1401 2018-01-16 20:50:42 One thing that transcends political party in the governor's office is praising themselves for the rebound of oil and gas and the accompanying revenue it brings. #nmleg
1402 2018-01-16 20:50:19 Gaat Wiebes samen met de Groningers vechten’ tegen de NAM? Of ie in dienst van? Een beetje net als Rutte. Voor de Shell? Weet U nog? Die 1,4 miljard. NAM is toch ook Shell en Standard oil? Rockefeller, toch? Of noemen ze dat #gasgek? Ik denk dat ‘ze’ wel menselijk zijn. Niet?
1403 2018-01-16 20:50:01 It might have affected @SteveKBannon testimony when in the back of the room Anthony The Mooch showed up with Bannon's brother at his side. And why Bannon when pressed about @DonaldJTrumpJr  meeting w/Russians then claimed he & Donald Sr were in the olive oil business together.
1404 2018-01-16 20:49:58 I still would rather get the oil in things. I've often taken tablespoons of olive oil before though.
1405 2018-01-16 20:49:55 Got off early and went to get an oil change I've been putting off #adulting
1406 2018-01-16 20:49:55 Steven Chu is awesome.  Shell? Meh...at least better than US oil companies.
1407 2018-01-16 20:49:54 My expensive oil perfume from egypt spilt and is probs all wasted now :/
1408 2018-01-16 20:49:42 ok but i got this oil diffuser & im in loveee
1409 2018-01-16 20:49:36 There is a Pasta rule for Italians. If there isn't enough water to boil pasta Italian troops get a debuff. And daily oil evaporation percent is based on what type container a nation uses.

1413 2018-01-16 20:48:53 Next time you're at the store, grab a jar of coconut oil. Make sure it's organic, unrefined coconut oil. I use it on my whole body during winter. You'll smell good and you're skin will thank you.
1414 2018-01-16 20:48:46 what i mean is to the extent that everyone lives inside of symbolic misery, then Andersson is both accurate regionalist, and allegorical. & Extra hilarious when you think to consider how Americans' hobby is to idealize the oil kingdoms of Scandinavia as truly existing socialism..
1415 2018-01-16 20:48:41 But those are modern cars! Fancy ones too. Verily not the cup of tea I am looking for. (my cup of tea is covered in oil and flakes of rust).
1416 2018-01-16 20:48:39 Wow drive in oil change is a real ASMR roller coaster for me
1417 2018-01-16 20:48:35 Just got an oil change & tire rotation...what that mean ? 100 all the way home 
1418 2018-01-16 20:48:23 Governor touts diversification and rebound of state revenue, but most of that attributable to oil and gas rebound. #nmpol

1420 2018-01-16 20:48:04 Likely I am swimming against the tide a bit here but feels like #oil inverse is over done. Simple view says commodity markets in carry unless supply super tight but oil not so and front end stretched by huge spec long. I like the fade trade especially after such a big move.
1421 2018-01-16 20:47:36 Anything to do with the law suits oil companies are receiving from other US cities like NYC? Isn't Pasadena and Baytown almost toxic because of their refineries?
1422 2018-01-16 20:47:33 Starting off the new year with an oil diffuser....what have I become?
1423 2018-01-16 20:47:28 anyway i just spent $60 for an oil change am i an idiot sandwich or what!!
1424 2018-01-16 20:47:22 I was considered skinny & mom took me to doctor. I ate everything put before me. Doc gave fab malt & cod oil. I caught up with my 5'8" a year later. Vics model is starved.
1425 2018-01-16 20:47:06 @2ndClassElitist just ordered a sample from @badassbeardcare should be here soon. Got a trial balm and oil in the pirate. Now where did I hide my rum....

1427 2018-01-16 20:46:51 Absolute new favorite salad: kale, baby spinach, arugula. Cherry tomatoes. Pine nuts. Feta cheese. Dress with olive oil and vinegar. Season with salt, cumin, and garlic powder. Mix well and enjoy. With water for lunch. With white wine for dinner. #voilà
1428 2018-01-16 20:46:36 I don’t need a relationship, I need someone that knows how to change oil on their own and someone to turn my car on for me in the morning
1429 2018-01-16 20:46:30 surely oil on water is the most personal song for dan
1430 2018-01-16 20:46:27 Psoriasis? It takes experimentation and persistence to discover effective treatments for an individual.  Consumers have reported gaining relief of the dry, itchy skin associated with psoriasis, by using Emu Oil as part of their regimen. @emuproducts #emuoil #psoriasis
1431 2018-01-16 20:46:26 Gov. talking about diversity of economy? Huh? We're still on the oil and gas price rollercoaster, just a different part of it. A diverse economy doesn't fall apart when WTI goes below 40 bucks/bbl #nmpol
1432 2018-01-16 20:46:16 Hahaha glad this was resolved before an argument broke out over a misunderstanding! Was aimed at the guy who claimed this was a voluntary thing, he’s replied to a few people on this tweet, seems like there’s a bit of an agenda to defend.
1433 2018-01-16 20:46:02 Coconut oil all over my body, I’m feeling silky smooth.
1434 2018-01-16 20:45:47 I fear that our true motivation is about oil and our own flailing economy about the failure to destroy Al Qaeda and about revenge.
1435 2018-01-16 20:45:43 olive oil on a bit of cotton wool leave overnight any wax build up should be soft by then 
1436 2018-01-16 20:45:43 Gotta give those onions a head start if you want caramelization without turning that beef into jerky.

Onions with oil, salt & pepper for 3-4 minutes. Add peppers and cook for 2 minutes, then add minced garlic and steak. Add cheese 1 minute before steak is done, fill toasted roll
1437 2018-01-16 20:45:29 Let us repeat: increased oil and gas drilling DOES NOT equal diversification. Future generations demand better of us and our leaders #nmleg
1438 2018-01-16 20:45:21 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
1439 2018-01-16 20:45:19 My view on adoption of CIF on Merit against FOB in the carriage of our CRUDE OIL in international trade comes with innumerable advantages
1440 2018-01-16 20:45:16 Okay y'all, here's a quick recipe for meal prep. Roast some sweet potatoes, broccolini, red onions, mushrooms and kale with some olive oil
1441 2018-01-16 20:45:15 So they say
Barrett Wallace's become a crusader
He's cleanin up Midgard
(About time)
So they say Cloud Strife is helpin
Don't fuck up now
(He fucked up)
So they say we'll have oil and coal
We can get rid of mako
Thanks to you

1443 2018-01-16 20:45:13 Thank GOD... MY MUSLIM FRIENDS AGREE WITH THIS TOO.. WHY SHUDNT THE OIL RICH NATIONS SEND EM TICKETS AND ACCOMODATIONS  #Hajj
1444 2018-01-16 20:44:40 Your excellency sir, I happened to be one of your loyal fan. Your Excellency sir, can you please find a lasting solution to the Atrocity, NUPENG, NNPC and Oil marketers are committing towards Nigerians. We the masses are the one suffering from thesituation our find ourselves,
1445 2018-01-16 20:44:28 putting oil in your ear is such a hardcore experience like the pain and muffling and noise and dripping like
1446 2018-01-16 20:44:06 She lathered herself in oil of ulay then 
1447 2018-01-16 20:44:04 I'm looking into our () former prime Minister Carl Bildt. (He has blocked me). He have been involved with mining companies, Lundin Oil, Clintons, Georgia, Soros.  If you find anything on him, please post it. I believe he is involved in this corruption.
1448 2018-01-16 20:43:59 Just smashed an almost-full bottle of Citronella essential oil and now the house absolutely reeks. 
I *reallllllly* hope it’s true what they say, and it keeps those creepy af eight-legged monsters out of my house for the next decade...
1449 2018-01-16 20:43:54 Okay, yeah I’ve noticed almost every gel I try gets flakey. I’ve never tried the oil thing tho, I’ll def try that. Thanks girl 
1450 2018-01-16 20:43:54 Some, at least, probably have to do with expansion projects at oil fields, Tengiz for example.
1451 2018-01-16 20:43:43 I just focus on oil changes and rotating tires. Otherwise, I fix as needed. I’ve been driving for 31 years and I’m only on my 3rd car.
1452 2018-01-16 20:43:39 Probably also a lie.  US landowners that pump oil leave the derricks silent when gas prices as low as they are right now.  I’m sure oil is a5 low production.  Go drive past the oil fields I. Texas, Oklahoma, Colorado.  You’ll see lots and lots of derricks.  At a standstill.
1453 2018-01-16 20:43:37 Rubbing bio oil all over my body after coming out of the shower is one of the many ways in which I exercise self-love
1454 2018-01-16 20:43:33 I reiterate I’m not against oil; just the useless waste of it sitting at idle going absolutely nowhere in life while we wait for a $2 coffee
1455 2018-01-16 20:43:29 You can Google some countries in Europe that have made or are making the switch to renewables, and on a good day they get a majority of their energies from renewable energies. We would still need/ use oil, just less
1456 2018-01-16 20:43:11 I love spending my time oil pulling.
1457 2018-01-16 20:43:01 Push pull look lot better, ring him tomorrow ask advice and about ethanol proof i'll oil ya cable while it here feels bit rough. If it only cheap order new float valve, looks bit worn= flooding
1458 2018-01-16 20:42:48 When there's no more oil money to rely on , lazy people will disappear. Intellectuals/ biz pple will make use of the full potential of these places . So pple from the abroad can come and see
1459 2018-01-16 20:42:45 No, a friend of mine regularly freezes and unfreezes her oil based paints, you should be safe
1460 2018-01-16 20:42:40 I just don't know if anyone has done a classical oil painting of Oddjob yet, so what else could I match to?
1461 2018-01-16 20:42:33 I mean it can get flakey but honestly all gels get flakey after a while i usually will coat my hair with a regular oil after just so it will prevent it from flaking crazy but echo dont flake to bad
1462 2018-01-16 20:42:33 This bitch just said “girl coconut oil is good for anything your hair, skin, even your ain’t shit ass nigga”  I’m hollering 
1463 2018-01-16 20:42:00 smh getting my oil changed and the man said I need to get an air freshener if the cops pull me over I'm in trouble 
1464 2018-01-16 20:41:52 Overheard in Tesco: "sunflower oil....is that like a bean?"
1465 2018-01-16 20:41:51 I was just making sure we weren’t debating theology. :-) Never argue with a gold bug, it’s a religious argument. I probably need to sell gold. I don’t understand it all. It’s magic-money dug from the ground and vaulted in the ground. Makes little sense. Now oil. I understand oil.
1466 2018-01-16 20:41:48 Same in Australia - coconut oil & coconut water sold in many places, turmeric milk in cafes!!
1467 2018-01-16 20:41:29 If the warm oil is connected to delicious meat, cheese and sauce baked on top of crispy dough, give it to me now!
1468 2018-01-16 20:41:23 I dread the possibility that the sequel might be Brady running for Senator as a Trumpist, after a failed bid to hawk snake oil depletes his and his wife's fortunes.  Network TV never let's the story go on forever without ridiculous levels of drama.
1469 2018-01-16 20:41:16 WH tapped Frank Fannon for asst sec of State on energy resources.

1470 2018-01-16 20:41:14 Imagine that! When the largest lobby group is the Drug makers.. The “Land of the Free” where more citizens are incarcerated than any other country.  Oil/Drug companies have paid off our politicians and are destroying our environment and the growth in Green economic solutions. SAD
1471 2018-01-16 20:41:00 Tog två gamla favoriter - Midsona och Tethys Oil - till nåder igen efter mindre nedgångar. In med dem i portföljen igen ba'. Dagens sänke: NetEnt, -23%.  Behåller. 
1472 2018-01-16 20:40:54 @realDonaldTrump excuses Florida from offshore drilling? Offshore oil accidents causes permanent damage to the ocean, marine life,  the coast, local economies, a life on earth.

1473 2018-01-16 20:40:22 Considerin if you tried to take oil out of water (which would be difficult since they're both liquids) you wouldn't be able to touch the oil and say tht the water made the oil wet bc they dont mix wht so ever. Jus like water bouncing off wax paper, water does the same to oil.
1474 2018-01-16 20:40:19 Be sure to bring plenty of coconut oil, fellas!
1475 2018-01-16 20:40:18 BOOM Bitches!
1476 2018-01-16 20:40:11 During my makeup routine I drink a big glass of water. After exfoliating lips I put a bit of coconut oil on them. While I put makeup on and let the coconut oil sink into my lips.  #contest #POWDERMATTES @Maybelline  @InfluensterVox

1480 2018-01-16 20:39:42 Put olive oil in your ears..
1481 2018-01-16 20:39:22 Yeah, the list of foods I'm currently buying fair trade/ethically sourced or from British/European sources is: bananas, cacao/chocolate, asparagus, avocados, palm oil, coconut oil/products, tea and coffee, almonds/almond milk and quinoa... I'm learning every day

1484 2018-01-16 20:38:22 Intervention in Iraq over WMD's but none there U.S. still there but paying ISIS to stay there. Syria paying rebels to be there. Afganistan 911 not opium and oil still there. Lybia lie Gaddafi gold banking not good for U.S. List goes on if you want I can provide links.
1485 2018-01-16 20:38:17 Half my family are Scottish I wanted you to vote Leave the 1st time btw. I still do now. Also I thought you had included oil in your calculations as every video I watched which argued pro Leave went into great detail about it. I said bucket load of bother, not economic ruin
1486 2018-01-16 20:38:14 Dude bumping his music hella loud at the oil change place. There's nobody to flex on here big fella.
1487 2018-01-16 20:38:10 All this drilling should be done in Floridia, right under Maralago, so the president can fully enjoy all the rewards of his oil leases!
1488 2018-01-16 20:38:06 I think you're wrong. Many English were weary of Scotland bellowing for freedom and wished they would just go. Then Gordon Brown made that speech. It seemed a waste to break the union. I for one was pleased Scotland voted to stay. Stronger together and nothing to do with oil.
1489 2018-01-16 20:37:47 Cool! Was thinking WTF if you thought it sucked. Haha

1506 2018-01-16 20:36:25 I'm out of oil :((((
1507 2018-01-16 20:36:22 For sure! We also love lemon oil to spritz between shows to zing the air, and to energise our bodies. Lovely stuff! #earlyyearshour
1508 2018-01-16 20:36:15 Echo styler ! They have many different kinds i would recommend one that has either olive oil or argon oil but its the only gel i know that get my thick ass hair slick
1509 2018-01-16 20:36:04 Maybe you thought I was telling you to get real? I’m more than happy that this is happening.
1510 2018-01-16 20:35:57 And stop cheaping out on your United States customers with that poisonous preservative TBHQ. You manage to make fries in all the countries that banned TBHQ just fine without it. Pay for more oil, stop hurting your customers to save money.
1511 2018-01-16 20:35:47 おはありなのです
1512 2018-01-16 20:35:42 It’s not a religion; it’s economics. Oil is not renewable. I don’t see new dinosaurs dying to replace what we pump fast from the ground.

1519 2018-01-16 20:34:58 I understand that a woman was probably put under serious pressure to sign an agreement which would allow a serial abuser to walk free. And now someone has offered to provide the loophole for her to help bring him to justice.
1520 2018-01-16 20:34:57 I smell so good got me wanting to holler at myself lol glad I switched to coconut oil

1522 2018-01-16 20:34:46 Meanwhile rising consensus on oil prices scaling new highs - they must be seen in the context of record shale oil production and rig deployment; tempted to call a top in Oil in the 70-72 USD range

1524 2018-01-16 20:34:19 1.Nigeria is an oil exporter so why should there be gas scarcity in Nigeria,refineries are still redundant,same way Jonathan left them.
2.Most Nigerian roads are Death Traps all over the country but you spending billions of Dollars on Railway system.
3.Power supply still sucks,

1527 2018-01-16 20:33:14 Use olive oil to soften and soothe your cuticles. Dip a cotton ball in olive oil and apply to fingers and toes.
1528 2018-01-16 20:33:02 Sometimes vinegar removes any and all protective patina/oils, in addition to the rust.  You could coat the chain with spray clear coat or a bit of oil on a rag. Then again, it probably lasted many years before rusting in the first place.

1542 2018-01-16 20:31:48 Our government's corrupt FDA is fully aware that TRANSFAT (partially hydrogenated oil), is not safe at any level. Yet, they still allow it!
1543 2018-01-16 20:31:43 Perhaps the tech.doesn't transfer? Legally oil companies must repair what is left behind - very expensive in long term for rigs-to-reefs etc. - & they don't want that
1544 2018-01-16 20:31:36 OH YOU CAN REACT TO OLIVE OIL?? IT MATCHES MY SYMPTOMS??? MAYBE????
1545 2018-01-16 20:31:14 It's such a weird equivalent to make.  There's a reason people eat food instead of just chugging oil all day long!
1546 2018-01-16 20:31:07 I still think there is an opportunity up there to somehow low ball and buy these residual interests. At the right price I think 15-20% returns could be had. Esp with lower oil
1547 2018-01-16 20:31:06 Steam them for 15 and finish in a hot pan with olive oil. You get a softer, fluffier texture inside and a nice crispy crust on the outside.

1557 2018-01-16 20:29:46 that's good. Take care of yourself. Maybe you have some mint oil to put on or something. Always helps me a little.

1562 2018-01-16 20:29:16 was just voted "most likely to blot face with clean & clear oil absorbing sheets in inappropriate setting" and i couldn't be more thrilled.
1563 2018-01-16 20:29:05 Oil, human rights abuses, and a little Putin running the show.  You should get along great!
1564 2018-01-16 20:29:01 Just remember you don't have to do a full serving. I couldn't get past going back to olive oil after the spray logging the intake.  Then someone said,  "Don't do 2 tablespoons" Duh.
1565 2018-01-16 20:29:00 Prevent black spot and mildew on your #roses by applying a weekly #organic fungicidal spray. You can add 2 teaspoons of bicarbonate of Sola, one drop of biodegradable dishwashing liquid, plus half a teaspoon of horticultural oil to 2 litres of water and wet all the foliage
1566 2018-01-16 20:28:58 + 2 tbl spoons of olive oil  then you fry. No need to add oil   Overnight or a couple of hours.  It’s fucking spit on. Corn starch = corn flower

1569 2018-01-16 20:28:37 @animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
1570 2018-01-16 20:27:45 Exactly! Oil was left out of the calculations. Anyway, I've decided to stop telling people who are not living in Scotland about our wealth. The UK hides it for a reason and I reckon the more people who believe the lie we are too poor who have not got an IndyRef2 vote the better.

1580 2018-01-16 20:26:47 In 1999, Monica and Michael Keller bought 10 acres in Loma Rica, California, and started Calolea Olive Oil.

1582 2018-01-16 20:26:42 Went to get my oil changed before MORE snow comes. I'd highly reccomend @Valvoline in Fishers. 15 minutes. WAY faster than Jiffy Lube.
1583 2018-01-16 20:26:31 We should get an oil reimbursement, then everyone in our State would simmer down a bit. Alaska seems to be doing just fine.
1584 2018-01-16 20:26:26 I wish that years ago I knew about CBD & THC OIL for my severe chronic pain, instead of being perscribed heavy narcotics and told that's how my life was going to be till I died, I lost so many years. Educate & Advocate for yourself.

1589 2018-01-16 20:25:22 It’s hit or miss with beauty products. You have to keep trying until you find the one for your skin. I’ve been using sea breeze, noxzema, oil of olay & ponds cream since 15 and still using it at 48.
1590 2018-01-16 20:25:15 From oil changes to a transmission replacement, timing belt replacements, and cosmetic issues
1591 2018-01-16 20:25:04 As I am unable to consume highly-refined soy oil, but it's not a legally mandated regulation, and also not listed on your site, is there any way whatsoever I'd be able to find out if any items do have said soy oil?
1592 2018-01-16 20:24:59 But, but the drilling for oil... hypocritical????
1593 2018-01-16 20:24:50 That means I, regularly, consume about 12 teaspoons of warm oil.
1594 2018-01-16 20:24:49 @LOrealParisUK has the L'Oreal Elvive Extraordinary Oil Very Dry Hair Shampoo been discontinued?! It’s my fav shampoo and I can’t find it ANYWHERE 
1595 2018-01-16 20:24:32 If you properly tax the corporations and reduce military spending that protects BIG OIL you could afford to look after each other comfortably
1596 2018-01-16 20:24:21 Vaguely, but kinda yeah.
1597 2018-01-16 20:24:21 Let’s talk about how Harper landed us with investor-state arbitration with #FIPA (China). And then talk about how this process is also built into #TPP (that secret deal). And what about our requirement to supply the USA with a % of our oil imports under #NAFTA ?
1598 2018-01-16 20:24:05 Stir in three teaspoons of olive oil then stir vigorously.
1599 2018-01-16 20:23:56 Sorry, you're wrong.
1. What little more $$ ppl collect now will not only be disappearing in a few years, but middle class taxes will be going up.
2. No, not all power companies are lowering rates: as Congressman Kennedy explained, New England uses increasingly expensive fuel oil
1600 2018-01-16 20:23:52 (IMO) as an approximation, energy is free.  As time goes on, more people figure out how to have fewer intermediate forms(oil/coal)&middlemen in between them and the energy they want.  Funding moving towards machinery that catches the free energy instead of paying by the barrel.
1601 2018-01-16 20:23:45 A thigh massage with some warm oil sounds like heave right now
1602 2018-01-16 20:23:42 We can also encourage the switch to renewable energies and support politicians who are eco-friendly and want to move away from Big Oil. Not only will we run out soon enough, and not have a back-up plan, we are destroying the environment and soon it will be too late
1603 2018-01-16 20:23:37 Literally lathered myself in bio oil every hour today
1604 2018-01-16 20:23:33 I want to become the pasta~ Viva l'allegria! If you thing Virgin olive oil comes from???
1605 2018-01-16 20:23:31 I read “oli” as “oil” need to get better glasses.
1606 2018-01-16 20:23:22 @JeepCares @Jeep should a vehicle with under 24,000 miles have a list of problems this long? •2 new brake boosters•new camshaft•new rear shocks•a cracked gasket that’s leaking oil•thermostat that is also leaking oil? Please Help!
1607 2018-01-16 20:23:20 Well, and what are we supposed to do where the plant is not legal, at least most CBD products still have some THC, I think that is better than nothing.Another alternative is to make some oil from your own private plants and mix one with the other when you need it .
1608 2018-01-16 20:23:17 Healthcare and Bureaucracy are like oil and water. They don’t mix. I wish we didn’t intertwine them so. Treatment should never stop or be halted because of paperwork and preferred locations in my opinion.
1609 2018-01-16 20:23:14 Vitamin E oil is great for your skin. It keeps it looking young and plump!
1610 2018-01-16 20:23:10 yes, pizza is much tastier than oil
1611 2018-01-16 20:23:00 Really? I bought it about a week or two before Christmas. I started using it for my face but it's giving me lot of pimples. I stopped using it and started using aqueous cream, I don't breakout as much. I once read somewhere that coconut oil should be kept in a glass container.
1612 2018-01-16 20:22:49 I mean dahlin would be sick but tell me Brady tkachuck on the oil wouldn’t be fun to watch. He’s pretty offensively talented and still hits everything that moves. Also make the BOA more entertaining.
1613 2018-01-16 20:22:36 Until the oil revenue runs out.
1614 2018-01-16 20:22:35 Gun oil. Dura a lungo, non deve essere ravvivato, scivola tutto che è una meraviglia, non logora il preservativo.
1615 2018-01-16 20:22:33 That was mine; the FZR727: old FZR long stroke crank & widest bore possible. We ceramic coated the bores & it used to eat piston rings & drink oil. It was sold to a PB test rider (Kev Smith), then it blew up I think.
1616 2018-01-16 20:22:19 The disgusting part was swishing the coconut oil in my mouth for 15 mins but after that was done, and I spat it out. I noticed that my breath from breakfast was gone. I proceeded to brush my teeth and when that was done..whoa..my mouth was super fresh and still continues to be.
1617 2018-01-16 20:22:18 Well liquids can't get liquids wet. Oil and water have two different densities thts why they won't mix.
1618 2018-01-16 20:22:13 Best enjoy it while you can, before the bulldozers and oil rigs come into all those wonderful beautiful parcs!

1620 2018-01-16 20:21:38 that’s the only place i get them i just put use a couple drops of tea tree oil on my nose and chin before i go to bed and i wake up and u can see a difference i’ve had the same bottle for like 6 months and barely used a third of it
1621 2018-01-16 20:21:37 One of the things I think we forget too often is that most people AREN'T meteorologists. We shouldn't act like they're stupid b/c they don't know what we might consider obvious/common knowledge. My mechanic doesn't call me stupid for not knowing how to change my oil. #wxtwitter
1622 2018-01-16 20:21:37 This was in a wee tub, just stir it in the pasta - it had an oil slick on top and tasted of nasty cough mixture. I don’t know what I was expecting!
1623 2018-01-16 20:21:36 Cantu is really good. I had a roommate who used it often after moisturizing and she had really soft hair. 
I moisturise by getting my hair a lil damp, then applying oil on it to lock in the moisture. I wish u luck hun.
1624 2018-01-16 20:21:27 Don't know yet. Also in for an oil change and checkover. Am expecting a call tomorrow. Will make an announcement as soon as the news breaks....
1625 2018-01-16 20:21:18 I would like to report a tapping incident by @NeoMolefe_SA. The player in question is Firmino, iv had the player since game week 20 and BCWYWF United bought him last game week. Could the FA please look into this? @zizi_oil @Sandile_Dos @tlotlo20_ @SizweTwala
1626 2018-01-16 20:20:46 I tried the oil pulling and holy cow! My mouth feels a whole lot fresher.
1627 2018-01-16 20:20:37 I just had hot oil blasted at my face and right eye. 

My eyelid has blisters now, thanks to mom who thought it would be a good idea to boil fat in front of where I was cooking and not cover the pan

1631 2018-01-16 20:20:00 What's the difference between "warm oil" and just "oil"
1632 2018-01-16 20:19:28 today no country can be self-sufficient. China imports oil and natural gas from Russia, and LNG from the US. China is not  self-reliant in energy and raw materials. EU needs oil/natural gas, etc. the US needs rare earth and raw materials,Russia needs machinery tools

1) All oil mined from off US shores is to remain domestic. 
2)Heating oil be fixed at 1% of household income
3)40% of all profits to go towards public schools. 
4)10% to be used towards infrastructure repairs.

1650 2018-01-16 20:16:51 Nope. Standard Oil was pumping a somewhat finite resource. And ultimately controlling price.
1651 2018-01-16 20:16:32 Are you unhappy with your body wash because it dries your skin out ? Put a few tablespoons of baby oil in it. Shake before each use!
1652 2018-01-16 20:16:24 Thc or cbd oil? :)
1653 2018-01-16 20:16:17 While all this is true, it does leave out that Norway has a tiny population ($5-6m) and enormous oil revenues (slightly dents the environmental position). This doesn’t change the differences to the US, but might make it trickier to replicate
1654 2018-01-16 20:16:17 Niiiiiiiiiiiiiiice!

1664 2018-01-16 20:15:26 They completely ignore the fact that the oil price collapse and the big money that went with it could possibly have anything to do with it...  Cognitive dissonance.
1665 2018-01-16 20:15:04 Why do policy makers worry the economy could soon overheat, triggering RATE HIKES & inflation? Canada’s economy had a banner 2017 = synchronized global expansion, a housing boom & recovering oil prices, a sharp drop in unemployment  & output growth that beat expectations.

1672 2018-01-16 20:14:35 I use dish soap and a touch of coconut oil together. Dish soap gets all the gunk and oil out and coconut oil keeps them soft.
1673 2018-01-16 20:14:31 I also had to get spark plugs replace, oil refilled and something else. It was pretty expensive but no complaints. I rather have my car fixed before it breaks down on me. 
1674 2018-01-16 20:14:24 NEED Car upgrades like we used to have where we used credits to buy engine parts, etc.  oil changes, car wash.

1682 2018-01-16 20:12:56 Uhh...except Standard Oil is now chevron who bought nearly everyone back up.  Banks, Airlines, Energy and Cell companies need to be broken up before you touch tech lol
1683 2018-01-16 20:12:47 @nestsupport I currently have a single stage oil furnace and am planning to replace it with a two-stage, variable speed fan propane furnace. Will my Nest thermostat work with the new furnace?

1685 2018-01-16 20:12:42 Who doesn't like coconut oil? Or was Ryan trying to tell us that you've been eating Preparation H this whole time
1686 2018-01-16 20:12:40 I’m now called a moron because I don’t belong to your religion. Let’s get some more pipe lines built so our oil can at least be priced at world market so we can all live better lives

1690 2018-01-16 20:12:30 Like the regulations Clinton removed that lead to the 2008 housing market collapse? Or the regulations that prevent millions of gallons of oil from spilling? Or the regulations that force your investment advisor to act only in your best interests? Those regulations?
1691 2018-01-16 20:12:22 That you? 
1692 2018-01-16 20:12:21 Andrea, you failed to give credit to Trump and his policy of cutting off oil to N. Korea and getting China on board in getting N.Korea into talks.  Even S. Korea credited Trump.  Obama / Clinton/ Kerry accomplished NOTHING in 8 years. Your liberal bias is showing...

1697 2018-01-16 20:11:36 The president cannot determine the price of crude in the international market, same market oil marketers patronize, it's about cost and selling prices. We have deregulated.

1723 2018-01-16 20:07:35 Hydration is adding water to the skin and moisturizer in some cases adds oil. Which is why a lot of people with oily skin can still lack hydration (water)

1728 2018-01-16 20:06:49 Hydrocarbons are in the natural gas and crude oil but just because these things are extracted does not mean hydrocarbons are released into the atmosphere. they have to be burned to do that. Hydrocarbons exist in the natural gas & crude & not outside of them until burned

1732 2018-01-16 20:06:36 I often cycle on & off caffeine for the very same reasons. My caffeine-free energy blend consists of:

Choline 1 gram

I'd also recommend a gram of L-Tyrosine. It's an amino acid our body uses to produce energizing  noradrenaline & dopamine.
1733 2018-01-16 20:06:27 You really should. You can ask your Doctor about oil.

1754 2018-01-16 20:03:25 It’s from my cabinet over the stove. I needed the vegetable oil.
1755 2018-01-16 20:03:17 Fraud...something the New Yorkers warned us about. 45 is a fraud and eventually snake oil runs out of production.
1756 2018-01-16 20:03:17 It's all thanks to the oil that they can live so nicely. Did you know btw that people would like to work for 6 short hours if possible?

1773 2018-01-16 20:01:35 Main export is oil & gas, clueless. 

And they are wisely selling it to suckers as they move to EVs (more than 50% market share of electrified vehicles now).

1781 2018-01-16 20:01:13 Maybe it's time the US stops funding all the middle eastern countries and let them implode on their own. That would be wishful thinking. While they're at it they should also stop meddling in middle East affairs cuz of oil

1784 2018-01-16 20:00:32 Quick note. That’s not what “literally” means. Saudi Arabia makes its money from selling crude oil. Since advancements in extraction technologies, the US no longer buys much from them. The KSA is under sharia law, which means NO human rights. Don’t blame the US for sharia.
1785 2018-01-16 20:00:28 Go to get an oil change and they fucking cracked my passenger window !!!!!
1786 2018-01-16 20:00:04 @BetoORourke What is your position on gun control?  Noting about this in "Issues" on website.  Why should I vote for a Texas senator who wants to let the US EPA regulate oil and gas drilling in Texas?
1787 2018-01-16 20:00:00 Well I'm putting on more oil first.
1788 2018-01-16 20:00:00 We made a conscious choice. And note, Norway started down that path long before oil was discovered. Oil made it easier, but our welfare path had already been 20 years in the making when oil was discovered. So there is that.

1800 2018-01-16 19:58:26 A lot of chatter about how Norway has better government. Better healthcare, better education, family leave, etc. One reason for all that is they've nationalized their oil industry. Just try that shit here.

1809 2018-01-16 19:57:27 Sounds to me like you have 2 separate issues. Oil leak definatly one of them. The other is that those engines are known to have timing chain issues.

1817 2018-01-16 19:56:53 SHELL, la petrolera multinacional que aquí condujo Juan José Aranguren hasta su incorporación al gobierno de Macri como ministro de Energía, se adelantó a todos y ya produjo un 8% de aumento en sus combustibles.  La empresa OIL siguió sus pasos y de un momento a otro lo hará YPF.
1818 2018-01-16 19:56:46 Your argument is a question, the point of which I cannot follow. I also don't see the point of turning plastic back into crude oil (or back to from whatever it was derived from). You can burn it though, and recover the energy.
1819 2018-01-16 19:56:41 Fam, are we really citizens of an oil producing nation? 
1820 2018-01-16 19:56:36 I think that poor shirt is suffering, the material is screaming to be freed

Me: (Could this be, a text frome one of my beloved friends?)

High Quality: IT'S TRY IT TUESDAY, ARE YOU READY TO GET 69% OFF BIG DICK BAZUSO BUD??! EMPOWER YOURSELF WITH THIS OIL.

Me: (wow you always know what to say)
1823 2018-01-16 19:55:57 ive been looking for energy weakness to confirm and energy finally underperforming oil here

1825 2018-01-16 19:55:46 I take Vit D because I reckon the risks of brittle bones aren't worth not taking it. And cod liver oil because I don't eat enough fish
1826 2018-01-16 19:55:30 I know I wasn't talking about him for the Oil because I thought he would be long gone by 16. I was looking at Svechnikov as a likely possibility at that spot.
1827 2018-01-16 19:55:17 Meeting with agents of foreign government during the election is treasonous and unpatriotic so said Steve Bannon #2fire2furious @TomSteyer
1828 2018-01-16 19:55:08 Me and drama don’t mix , shit like water n oil 
1829 2018-01-16 19:55:08 Oil prices settle lower for first time in 6 sessions
1830 2018-01-16 19:55:04 I would like to know how this is Gerrymandering? LOL. Looks like republicans like Trump to me!!
1831 2018-01-16 19:55:00 were playing kahoot in class
im actually gonna kill @izfidel
1832 2018-01-16 19:55:00 Zero confirmation on a oil turn so far but i do like where XLE OIH XOM are at today. But means nothing without a follow through in the days ahead.

1835 2018-01-16 19:54:35 Look at the GDP of every country who elects their leaders.
Even South Korea without gas and oil have still bigger economy than Russia.

Rule or be ruled. Be slave to one or be free master with everyone else.
That is the point.
1836 2018-01-16 19:54:27 When I tried oil it looked like a bargain bin Picasso and I was trying to do a landscape lmao
1837 2018-01-16 19:54:13 HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
1838 2018-01-16 19:53:51 When did oil changes get so expensive .-.
1839 2018-01-16 19:53:47 So I guess we should burn crude oil in our cars instead of E85.  #cleancoal is #refinedcoal @CCTCInc
1840 2018-01-16 19:53:40 Holy crap....
1841 2018-01-16 19:53:39 .@TheRealJohnHCox, in a statement: "Our oil production in the country is going strong without additional off-shore drilling in California, I don't see a need to change that policy."
1842 2018-01-16 19:53:33 Smith idea: spaghetti smootie I want Japan to eat pasta! you thing Virgin olive oil comes from???
1843 2018-01-16 19:53:31 hope it doesn't turn out to be what oil turned out to be for Nigeria
1844 2018-01-16 19:53:12 @HerbChambersCo @Hyundai Oil change done, car key works. Explained to AWESOME GM it was the “shadiness” that was bad. Promised to speak to sevice manager to remind that honesty works best. Insisted I accept free oil change for next time. Left happier. Will try again.
1845 2018-01-16 19:53:04 Yeah that's definitely not good. Has to be going somewhere, and if you arent getting oil stains under it, I really hope it's not leaking into other parts of the engine :(
1846 2018-01-16 19:52:59 Well over 90% of the people in the province don't work in the oil industry and never made that kind of money. I have little sympathy for the dudes that pissed away their boom salaries. But that isn't the story for most people.
1847 2018-01-16 19:52:31 I just want to listen to some Hispanic music & drown my scalp in coconut oil tonight ...
1848 2018-01-16 19:52:30 Was about my reaction.
1849 2018-01-16 19:52:20 Hack and Stutterer lie through every orifice, Hack says that Xi is himself limiting purchases of US treasuries even after China denies same, speaks of cost of oil as a pending destroyer of JA's future. Well, the oil issue is directly related to Venezuela's Petrocaribe and
1850 2018-01-16 19:52:19 Without a doubt. Fish oil can be problematic for those with histamine or MCAD issues
1851 2018-01-16 19:52:17 Beauty hack: Bathe in coconut oil and Himalayan pink salt for the ultimate detox 
1852 2018-01-16 19:52:16 This is true. I find myself aghast at the lack of aesthetic standards in modern architecture!  Interior walls should be constructed of oil drums which will, of course, double as a convenient supply to the lamps.
1853 2018-01-16 19:52:05 I had thought that too because every time I change the oil I only get about 3 - 4 quarts out instead of the 5 it holds.
1854 2018-01-16 19:52:03 The amount of traction that this has generated for the dems (whether or not it was said) is mind numbing. 
DC really is the dumbest.
1855 2018-01-16 19:51:56 I don’t use palm oil. The only oils in my balm are sunflower, jojoba, and coconut oil
1856 2018-01-16 19:51:53 Coal is dead; but the utilities are complicit in continuing to breathe life into oil and gas extraction via horizontal hydraulic fracking. The bait and switch.
1857 2018-01-16 19:51:49 Black citizens must stand up and speak up... and get President Trump that space you mention.
1858 2018-01-16 19:51:45 I'm totally on board with this plan.
1859 2018-01-16 19:51:41 UPDATE: ODOT says the semi truck will be pulled out of the river tomorrow morning. -- maybe around 6am. Also -- A very small oil slick was found on the river

お昼ぐらいからやろや！

1862 2018-01-16 19:51:25 @Sandile_Dos @tlotlo20_ @zizi_oil @SizweTwala I would like to report a tapping incident, @NeoMolefe_SA has tapped Firmino. Could the FA look into this matter
1863 2018-01-16 19:51:10 I am a hunter fisherman, outdoor sportsman and studied geology in college. As long as humans need oil, until an alternative energy source is developed,oil must be tapped. As a user of oil our country must be self sufficient. Acceptable risk?
1864 2018-01-16 19:51:00 and that requires removing the warmongers/planet destroyers from power.  A MAJOR OVERHAUL IS NEEDED to remove banker & corp control, big oil gangs, intel military industrial complex cartel, ban lobbying, get foreign nations AIPAC/Israel out of DC & impeach the racists & fascists.
1865 2018-01-16 19:50:53 When you take close to 1.3 billion dollars from Alaskans...and the economy...it will have a negative impact. If the oil tax credits were indeed working, we would see more jobs. We don't. People are leaving Alaska, thousands of jobs lost.
1866 2018-01-16 19:50:38 We use oil for some heat, dishes, laundry, showers. So we do use it. Just a great reduction with an airtight stove. During the arctic outbreak woodstove couldn't do whole house, but it helped.
1867 2018-01-16 19:50:35 So they're checking a "phaser" to see if it went bad while it was running low on oil... plus there's a cam position sensor error that they said could have caused more damage.
1868 2018-01-16 19:50:34 me, dousing my scalp in tea trea oil and anti-acne face masks for fear that i will get head acne from plastering my head in hairspray every day
1869 2018-01-16 19:50:25 last night i took a bath in lavender and sunflower seed oil, himalayian sea salt, raspberry leaves, lavender and jasmine flowers. i had about 10 candles lit and 2 vodka sodas. i slept like a baby for 12 straight hours afterwards.
1870 2018-01-16 19:50:21 its so cold and my skin is so dry im about to rub oil everywhere
1871 2018-01-16 19:50:17 Imagine inheriting oil money.. where were my parents when other parents were constructing oil rigs?
1872 2018-01-16 19:50:17 dont have a position on dollar. Playing dollar strength theu oil, energy, gold miner shorts
1873 2018-01-16 19:50:14 i could watch a movie and stuff but no im gunna watch the new jenna julien podcast bc ITS SNAKE OIL 2 BITCHES
1874 2018-01-16 19:50:10 .@DougOse, in an interview, says he thinks CA should get the same treatment Florida received on offshore drilling. 1) "There is not enough oil in the shale to validate (oil companies) spending that kind of money." 2) "Nobody wants to see those rigs off of the coast."
1875 2018-01-16 19:50:07 oil or acrylic - canvas?
1876 2018-01-16 19:50:05 I wished I knew anything about how to paint with oil paints TvT''
1877 2018-01-16 19:50:04 She, too, got up and washed the oil from her hands, making a mental note of what Rayne had said. Stepping over to the small closet located in the bathroom, she pulled out a spare towel and wrapped it around herself before heading out.

1879 2018-01-16 19:49:57 Give me a whole gallon of warm oil!
1880 2018-01-16 19:49:52 Olive oil. Lemon if I am feeling fancy. I almost never add salt (though a "mixta" of lettuce and tomato with oil, salt, and oregano is very nice).
1881 2018-01-16 19:49:48 Alaskans own 678,312 shares of SCHLUMBERGER LTD, worth $52,976,167. It's from the OIL SERVICES sector, based in CURACAO.
1882 2018-01-16 19:49:47 Started idling rough on Friday, and the codes where showing a bunch of misfires. We tried a fuel system cleaner, and that didn't help much. Today the shop said it was almost out of oil and they did an oil change which they said helped, but didn't fix it...
1883 2018-01-16 19:49:35 Yes, how about this? They can give $235 million in a loan to the oil industry for the orphan well program plus $30 million of fed cash to ensure the loan is tax free. They give billions to the oil industry to become competitive. AISH? Nah. #CripTheVote2019 #Ableg #Abpoli #cdnpoli
1884 2018-01-16 19:49:32 Expecting to wake up tomorrow to read that the clubs been sold to the Abu Dabi Raji Gaji oil company for 350m and Staveley was a smokescreen #itk #amifuck #NUFC
1885 2018-01-16 19:49:24 What about those who claim no religion?
Or those whose religion includes Mother Earth?
You know, the people whose land you think looks best with oil pipelines...
1886 2018-01-16 19:49:24 Big developments in #KRG oil/gas sector in past week. #oott
1)Deloitte publishes audited oil accounts for H1 2017

3)Pearl to boost gas output 20% in 2018

1892 2018-01-16 19:49:00 Its different to Pakistani biryani. The lamb/beef sits in a rich thick sauce. Layered with fried potatoes, fried onions and saffron rice. Hot oil poured over for a final sizzle.
1893 2018-01-16 19:48:51 Truthfully, Lucas Oil Stadium is operated by the Indianapolis Capital Improvement board.
1894 2018-01-16 19:48:49 There we go! My man with the rescue!
1895 2018-01-16 19:48:42 Lol!  I’m a Hispanic woman who’s ex oil boyfriend was racist against my people! I just happened to be what he thought was beautiful! Racists are hypocrites! Even the pro trumpets hit on me! Go figure.  They even had their racist posts! A beautiful P@##y is a beautiful p@##y!
1896 2018-01-16 19:48:28 “i hiked from georgia to maine on the appalachian trail and we literally drank olive oil.” #ThingsIHearInCollege

1898 2018-01-16 19:48:08 True enough
1899 2018-01-16 19:48:03 Governments are basing their policy decisions on #WEO2017, which means they're locking in more oil & gas. Other countries are exceeding their Paris targets & revising upwards.

Why would you assume massive failure rather than feasible success?
1900 2018-01-16 19:47:45 Took my truck for an oil change and it’s about to feel so weird to drive my car
1901 2018-01-16 19:47:33 Trump only takes
       money, effusive praise or starbucks candy
As far as giving, choose any snake oil salesman and ask for a refund
1902 2018-01-16 19:47:26 In the oil tank Chris. It's hardly rocket science 
1903 2018-01-16 19:47:23 Yes it should I’ve heard castor oil is really good for that kind of stuff!
1904 2018-01-16 19:47:12 I know that oil paint is an art medium so 'digital OIL painting' 
..... I'M SO CONFUSED OKAY
why can't words mean a thing
1905 2018-01-16 19:47:05 Its like the "legendary Two Girls One Cup" or whatever else Wootpool seems to collect.
1906 2018-01-16 19:46:53 Rashid top 3 with all that oil money buffs
1907 2018-01-16 19:46:46 Give me 6 spoons of warm oil to swallow, please.
1908 2018-01-16 19:46:36 I feel like two hours is a really long time for an oil change??? Am I wrong? 
1909 2018-01-16 19:46:33 They say oil like it's a bad thing.
1910 2018-01-16 19:46:25 ...Caused by continued depressed oil prices. Demand needs to rise so price will increase!!! We need oil @ $85/bbl
1911 2018-01-16 19:46:13 There is a lack of boobs on this thread.... Wait were we not talking about something seriously for a second there?
1912 2018-01-16 19:46:07 every time i get my oil changed i get a new list of problems going on with my car im takin the bus in 2018
1913 2018-01-16 19:46:02 I think my face is reacting negatively to argan oil

1916 2018-01-16 19:45:38 Billions of $$ underfoot? Oil? Have you been sleeping? The world is moving away from oil.
1917 2018-01-16 19:45:35 The countries which dropped their bums on Libya don think Libyan will accept you.forget it don’t full yourself as a savior,you will never drink Libyan oil easily
1918 2018-01-16 19:45:34 Drinking lemon water, have  sweet orange in my oil diffuser, vanilla candle is LIT, and watching @stellarae ‘s vlog  #vibes
1919 2018-01-16 19:45:23 Yeah dawg, put olive oil in it then you’ll be able to comb out the gum
1920 2018-01-16 19:45:18 Snake oil
1921 2018-01-16 19:45:05 $63 per barrel oil not enough to save those jobs?

1923 2018-01-16 19:44:46 I just bought a mini robot oil diffuser. Damn you #AmazonPrime !! #shakesfist

1925 2018-01-16 19:44:33 Cornholio
1926 2018-01-16 19:44:26 I could of changed my oil faster than these fools.
1927 2018-01-16 19:44:24 So I’m sitting at jiffy lube waiting to get my oil changed and this dude next to me decides to make small talk with a girl in here about his dirty air filter...her face right now is priceless
1928 2018-01-16 19:44:16 Good luck! The first night is the hardest, I think. Gets so much easier... until the progesterone in oil injections after/just before your transfer. All the best! 
1929 2018-01-16 19:44:15 The oil belongs in little pools on every piece of pepperoni. Plus that perfect sheen that a good pizza has. So yes, yes I feel like eating pizza. It's still the 5th food group
1930 2018-01-16 19:44:15 Thieves oil is a safe, effective, antimicrobial powerhouse. It's been used since the Middle Ages to help fight off all sorts of bugs and disease. With this flu season being one of the worst in a decade, it's probably a good idea to have thieves oil in your medicine cabinet!
1931 2018-01-16 19:44:12 Or is it the oil? Lol
1932 2018-01-16 19:44:06 The PM asked if the nation wants to be by the side of lucky or unlucky and considered themselves lucky when Oil prices were falling. Are they running out of luck for 2019?
1933 2018-01-16 19:44:03 So many things qualify as "disabled" it's ridiculous. 60% work, means 40% don't. And these are able bodied. Working 20 hrs is not a burden
1934 2018-01-16 19:43:59 Suffice to say, economic security helps the entire economy which strengthens the private sector & hence raises tax revenue. Clearly the impact of a lucrative oil industry helps every aspect of a national economy which eases the burden of social spending.
1935 2018-01-16 19:43:53 And oil revenue. Why can’t we get immigrants with oil revenue?
1936 2018-01-16 19:43:52 When you get $10 off an Oil Change for being an Eagles fan  yaaaas. #FlyEaglesFly
1937 2018-01-16 19:43:49 I just saw someone use the words 'digital oil painting'
....
.............
is 'oil' an art style?
I'm seriously confused
1938 2018-01-16 19:43:48 i am getting an oil change for the first time (my dad did them before) and the dude walked out to my car and i am embarrassed bc i have a mess also i’m hungry and wearing a drug rug and it is hot outside why
1939 2018-01-16 19:43:44 This is the only oil spill im ok with
1940 2018-01-16 19:43:31 sounds like a migraine, i get them pretty often. buy some peppermint oil and massage it on the area of your head, it helps. also take ibuprofen before bed for the next two days! and just sleep sleep sleep
1941 2018-01-16 19:43:29 Houston homes sold at a record pace in 2017, the economy could get a boost if oil prices continue to recover. Houston market accounted for 1 in 5 of nation's 50 best-selling master-planned communities in 2017.
1942 2018-01-16 19:43:21 If Trump didn’t call them that I know millions of deplorables willing to take up that slack.
1943 2018-01-16 19:43:17 Organic, cold pressed, cold processed castor oil. Preferably the Home Health brand. You only need a dab because it's so thick.
1944 2018-01-16 19:42:59 @lostinvegas83
Keep up the awesome work guys!
Let's get some Lynyrd Skynyrd - Free Bird, if you guys like to jam and drum out with the baby oil /wink this song is for you!!
1945 2018-01-16 19:42:50 There is literally a scene where two guys are doing a shopping race and i would for real watch a legit sport of it.
1946 2018-01-16 19:42:47 Not gonna lie, I'd put some extra olive oil on it too.
1947 2018-01-16 19:42:42 This give me more of a liberal college/ essential oil/ I raise chickens to be more organic/ shoes are not my thing/ Woodstock vibe. But my big nose can’t handle it

Khalti has her nose pierced though. Lol note we do live not to far from Woodstock.

1955 2018-01-16 19:41:32 Everyone knows America was founded only by immigrants with advanced degrees who debated the soil into growing, peer-reviewed oil out of the ground, and lectured railroads across the continent.

1958 2018-01-16 19:41:03 It was in the fall of 2002 when Trump imported two twin sisters from Slovakia — Melania and Etta. Because of the legal hurdles to disguise the transaction (I’ve documented this before), Etta underwent a name change when she was sold to Alaskan oil baron Bartholomew Morel
1959 2018-01-16 19:40:57 I thought it was funny but then I switched off. The only Hentai I watched all the way through was a ghost possesses sex toys in a girls' house and well it was just crazier from there
1960 2018-01-16 19:40:54 You definitely can't! The best have natural bergamot oil!
1961 2018-01-16 19:40:54 I wouldn't think so. Afghanistan was about the Taliban and Bush was in office. Kazakhstan is a relatively stable country albeit it's full of corruption. Soviets discovered very large but hard to access oil/gas/mining reserves there. Many have tried and failed to get them out.
1962 2018-01-16 19:40:45 I suspect oil-and-pellet is a common combination in NH
1963 2018-01-16 19:40:43 Finally got Trina’s oil changed... pushed out like a extra 1500miles 
1964 2018-01-16 19:40:37 Soon not to be many agricultural products when your prez does away with NAFTA and starts tariff wars overseas.  By your definition,  energy products means oil so have fun with the spills and remember the tax cut did away with the oil spill cleanup funds.
1965 2018-01-16 19:40:27 Polyunsaturated bonds oxidise quickly. #Coconutoil is the only cooking oil that doesn't oxidise, leaving it non-toxic.

1967 2018-01-16 19:40:21 @RoyBlunt, if you are pro-farmers, why are you backing SB1512, which prohibits federal agencies from incorporating social costs of carbon, methane and nitrous oxide emissions into oil, gas and coal policy?  "Social costs" include REDUCTION IN NET AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY.
1968 2018-01-16 19:40:10 Endless oil story
1969 2018-01-16 19:40:05 .... you *are* aware of my horrible literary pretensions, yes? 

But yes, I'm annoyed because this is 21st century snake oil that's taking off and I still have to worry about paying bills. 

BUT HEY MY KARMA WILL BE EXCELLENT SO

1973 2018-01-16 19:39:48 U.S. has met Russian oil output and will become the leading supplier of the world's oil in 2019.  Thank you Mr. Putin, your orders are helping the U.S. just fine.

1979 2018-01-16 19:39:21 The problem was the country’s dependence on oil. That started long before the country turned to socialism. The fall of oil prices killed their economy.

1981 2018-01-16 19:39:04 @francismmaxwell  some people are just totally blind America has never been great and those shithole countries is where everything in this country came from those countries so gold diamonds oil and people who built this country from the ground up okay from those shitholes!!

1987 2018-01-16 19:38:12 $oil still got a few trading days left before the expiration date, expect it to stay relatively close to 65 until 1/22. 

no need to rush here, it will losing the steam after option manipulators are in the money

1989 2018-01-16 19:37:51 It looks like a bottle of motor oil......
1990 2018-01-16 19:37:49 Its fun how many people actually admit to not only having knowledge of it, but have watched it.

1992 2018-01-16 19:37:41 The DOW has rose to a new high, but Trump should expect it. The CEO's and corporations are having a temp rise because of their windfall from the tax bill. What goes up, will come down. Just look at the trade deficit, 3 times what it was in the negative. Price of oil, up up up.
1993 2018-01-16 19:37:39 Hunnigan, could you check and see if the BSAA has only units near the oil field?
1994 2018-01-16 19:37:31 Are you joking ? He is in the criminal pocket of trump and his group of money grabbers and as soon as the campaign is over FLORIDA GOES BACK ON THE OIL DRILLING LIST BACKED HEAVILY BY YOUR GUY!

1996 2018-01-16 19:37:16 Signing the NDA was almost certainly a condition of the settlement. That isn't being "forced" to sign. If you want to equate conditions with coercion, you'll be upending all of contract law.
1997 2018-01-16 19:37:16 Uh huh! This is true! 
1998 2018-01-16 19:37:14 The only arguement I could put to you is, if a certain type of plastic can't be recycled in this country, why is it being allowed to be produced here?

Also, there is oil in them there plastics, it also must be too expensive a process to reconstitute it(for want of a better word)
1999 2018-01-16 19:37:10 Very useful essential oil and informative post.
2000 2018-01-16 19:37:00 Um, no. It was Democratic presidents Wilson and FDR who led the US into both world wars. It was idiot GOP Presidents Bush & Bush Jr. that got us into Middle Eastern Wars, particularly in Iraq post 9/11 which had nothing to do w/Bin Laden. "Conservatives" only go to war over oil.
2001 2018-01-16 19:36:57 Collen, wise communication adage: The squeaky hinge gets the oil. Another: If it bleeds, it leads.
Sometimes, we're so focused on what's 'going wrong' that we miss what's going right.

2004 2018-01-16 19:36:26 What kind of budget cuts were made to maternal/newborn healthcare? How many regional clinics and hospitals were closed? How many food pantries and WIC programs shut down? All so the oil and gas industries could have free reign across the state.

2031 2018-01-16 19:33:21 Fair. Let's keep in mind, though, getting pipelines approved that cross provincial borders & jurisdictions isn't as easy as Kenney makes it sound. If it were that simple, prior Conservative gov'ts would have had pipelines in and oil flowing long before this became an issue.

2035 2018-01-16 19:32:49 Fuel Oil:  Suppliers eager to offload cargoes ahead of CNY saw buying interest, lifting the volume on Tuesday to their highest in over a week, lower supplier offers and resulting values narrowed cash premiums of 380-cst fuel oil cargoes to a four-session low.

2037 2018-01-16 19:32:40 Rising prices of Crude Oil in the international market is raising big concerns in the country. Subsequently, the domestic market faces the heat. From a source, an estimated 42lac barrels of oil is consumed annually in India.

Please emotions , leave me alone.
2052 2018-01-16 19:31:15 hi grace, the dish is vegetarian but not vegan. 

it is in the allergen guide as being possibly fried in the same oil as egg therefore to avoid the risk we recommend not ordering it if you want to avoid diary products.
2053 2018-01-16 19:31:04 Fr they get my oil changed in 30 min! And I miss you more!!!! Next time I come to town I'm not gonna ask to hangout I'm just gonna show up wherever you are!
2054 2018-01-16 19:31:03 Wasn't swallowing oil like an actual health thing for a while? Like castor oil back in the old days, but fish oil is a legit thing too.

Plus what if that oil is EVOO and it has herbs and such in it?
2055 2018-01-16 19:30:59 Is it because the “olive”oil may not be real olive oil?
2056 2018-01-16 19:30:52 Got hot oil on my finger, then proceeded to slip and fall on water which resulted in more back pain, leg pain and shoulder pain.

2065 2018-01-16 19:30:03 Haha again I half agree. Yes, oil hurt us. The problem is everything she did hurt us more. So yes, if the economy had been better she’d look better. But it is bad and she has failed to do anything substantial to turn things around.
2066 2018-01-16 19:30:00 Solidly green on XLE and oil shorts... but haters gon' hate!
2067 2018-01-16 19:29:51 Oh yes, understandably. But yummy fresh oil on your artichokes, bread etc? Even a sprinkling of seeds over your salad, if that's a thing you're up for (I lurv it). Nom nom nom. Have you any experience of walnut oil? (I don't, & it's the thing I'm looking forward to trying next.)
2068 2018-01-16 19:29:43 These ships carry gas, not oil. The deliver the gas through pipelines that go to electricity generators. This saves using oil which is more polluting. Gas will not ‘spill,’ at least not for long.
2069 2018-01-16 19:29:25 Teaspoon?? Tablespoon?? Avocado oil? Coconut oil? Olive oil? Baby oil?

2071 2018-01-16 19:29:19 Throat is kinda scratchy. Not sure if I'm in the final stages of this not-really-sick-but-congested stuff or this oil is causing dryness in my throat.
2072 2018-01-16 19:29:08 2-With ANWAR & offshore drilling opening up, price of oil plummets. The media and the enviro's know this. Trump said he'd protect Medicare & SS (which I paid for) and he is.  Paul Ryan is a globalist and a progressive. He supports expansion of social progs. They’re BS-ing you.
2073 2018-01-16 19:29:00 So while it is very true that the knock on benefits of finding oil have been huge in terms of jobs, tech, education etc., our taxes pay for most of our welfare state, not oil revenue.
2074 2018-01-16 19:28:55 I dont know, we have the best ones, Ramirez Sardines, but the fucking EU is destroying our canned sardines industry ... if they use Olive Oil then it should be good ...
2075 2018-01-16 19:28:27 This has been tried.  The Nationalist want oil reserves without imports to isolate us from the problems of Mid East oil.  The last time we fracked our way to cheaper oil, the OPEC nations dropped their price and devastated the oil market.  (SAD)

2082 2018-01-16 19:27:21 You need to read up on how Norway uses oil revenue. If you had you’d learn that only a very small portion of yearly oil revenue is invested into the economy (in order to avoid inflation). The rest is plowed into our sovereign wealth fund, which isn’t allowed to invest in Norway.

Trump’s correctly faced down Kim unlike predecessors. Oil price unrelated to Trump. Middle East is producing less oil so the price goes up.

2094 2018-01-16 19:26:08 Yeah, just overdue for inspection sticker and oil change.
2095 2018-01-16 19:26:03 Very disappointed in the service dept here. They turned me away from a walk in oil change. Really.? @MillenniumHonda took me as a walk in all the time. With out a issue @MillenniumHyund so what's your problem?
2096 2018-01-16 19:25:57 what is even going on in this pic. settin up my oil diffuser while so drunk im almost falling off the couch
2097 2018-01-16 19:25:52 it's weird b/c you know whoever's complaining about this tosses a salad in half a bottle of olive oil and calls it healthy haha.

2100 2018-01-16 19:25:38 It's the muscles. Some aggressive girls think just because you have a good physique it's license for them to violate your person. Also, A+ humblebrag. :-P
2101 2018-01-16 19:25:20 40 rigs added in last 11 weeks. Half were oil, but the surge in associated gas, combined w production growth elsewhere, could outpace demand growth — esp if LNG production is shut-in in spring. Therefore, even very cold winter weather may not lift risk premiums for #natgas
2102 2018-01-16 19:25:19 Coconut oil is the answer to everything!
2103 2018-01-16 19:25:11 cbd oil stops my seizures and helps with sharp pain in nerves. Doesn't get anyone high.
2104 2018-01-16 19:25:05 Unless you have ever been apart of a something where you are basically forced to sign an NDA then it's hard to get. I have and it wasn't voluntary. She may if been forced to just to get the conviction/settlement.
2105 2018-01-16 19:24:51 NOT.  Do you people even care about the animals In the ocean that will be effected by the oil in Trumps stupid oil drills? He doesn’t even care about the earth.
2106 2018-01-16 19:24:48 If we have real Arab leaders, they would cut that money from the oil exported to USA & give it to the Palestinians. But unfortunately, we don't...
2107 2018-01-16 19:24:37 I fully endorse this means of shopping
2108 2018-01-16 19:24:35 今、プリンタ無いんですよ～

2109 2018-01-16 19:24:33 …what part of $70 oil is irrational exuberance?
2110 2018-01-16 19:24:25 Technically it’s backed by oil
2111 2018-01-16 19:24:10 I don't like everything Notley's done, but I also don't like the UCP trying to lay blame on her for a poor economy, when we can take that all back to the price of oil. She's been the most-disadvantaged premier Alberta has had in decades, & that has to be taken into consideration.
2112 2018-01-16 19:24:02 Omg yay! And I just read they no longer use palm oil, so I can happily eat it! 
2113 2018-01-16 19:23:58 It's snake oil. They treat tendencies as though they are "laws".
2114 2018-01-16 19:23:38 Everyone needs to go and eat Proteinella its soooo gut and has no palm oil like Nutella cos palm oils gonna kill us one day yano
2115 2018-01-16 19:23:37 He's not locked in with them. They're locked in with him. Daily dousings with cooking oil after every attempted shanking must be fun.
2116 2018-01-16 19:23:29 How long are you supposed to gargle coconut oil?
2117 2018-01-16 19:23:20 Oil px has only ever been a f(x) of supply/demand as it was only priced in USD's & we provided military protection to the biggest member of a cartel to control price.  What happens when price becomes a f(x) of supply/demand & USD FX cross rates v. CNY, EUR?
2118 2018-01-16 19:23:20 China races to tackle expanding oil spill after tanker sinks

Chinese ships scrambled Monday to clean up a massive and expanding oil spill after an Iranian tanker sank off China, raising fears of devastating damage to marine life. The Sanchi, carrying 136,000 tonnes of light…
2119 2018-01-16 19:23:02 Yes! FDR outlawed gold and possess a monopoly on the USD. And it worked. Monopolies are awesome like that. Does China have anything approaching monopoly in gold or oil?
2120 2018-01-16 19:23:01 Dude Wal-Mart shopping should be like using a public restroom: quickly, don't touch the walls, and hold your breath
2121 2018-01-16 19:22:58 Speaking of bergamot, yesterday I studied Shalimar again and I was excited to catch the bergamot. I caught it twice, for just a few seconds, but it was vivid and surprising! Bergamot is added to my "wanted" list of essential oil samples. (To do: 1 arm Shalimar, 1 arm bergamot.)
2122 2018-01-16 19:22:53 Wetin beard oil dey do abeg? I wan know
2123 2018-01-16 19:22:47 I feel like they do that to all girls.  one time, they tried to charge me $70 for just AN OIL CHANGE!!!!!!! I literally had to tell them it shouldn't cost that much and left... 
2124 2018-01-16 19:22:46 California has to do their part in producing oil.  Lower your consumption first by walking, riding bikes, skateboards, horses, carpets.  Just some ideas for our liberal friends.
2125 2018-01-16 19:22:32 -Prometieron "gas oil sin impuestos" !!

-Ese fue Lacalle padre para las elecciones del 89 !!!

- Bueno, ya es hora de cumplirlo !!
2126 2018-01-16 19:22:25 Spray bottle with water, conditioner, olive oil and avocado oil should help! Spray every morning.
2127 2018-01-16 19:22:06 And @MikeCrapo- bragging about stripping 13M people of health care, de-funding the Children’s Health Insurance Program, letting expire the payments that oil companies contribute to a fund for spill cleanups, and other functions of govt people actually value. #idaho #kleptocrats
2128 2018-01-16 19:22:01 Dean Heller is a coward 
October sanctions against Russia approved in bilateral both houses of Congress. 
These sanctions are on oil, technology banking services & individuals linked to the Russian oligarchs 
The sanctions are still not enforced
Russian Sanctions protect USA
2129 2018-01-16 19:22:01 If PMB wants to attain statesmanship statues he shld get his party to find a way to Restructure this country, let states become more viable and productive. The economy is recovering cos oil prices have risen. What happens when it plunges again. Another recession?
2130 2018-01-16 19:21:55 Mechanics forever tryna get you to spend more money, just change my oil sir so I can leave, I am broke
2131 2018-01-16 19:21:42 School is getting out early on the day I'm getting an oil change so my kids have to go by grams
2132 2018-01-16 19:21:28 Nor with oil.
2133 2018-01-16 19:21:26 Our stainless steel #nameplates are durable enough to withstand the harsh environments of the #oil and gas industry.
2134 2018-01-16 19:21:24 Favorite young living oil changes like who is my favorite child...currently it’s Northern Lights Black Spruce. So grounding and the smell is addictive!  #yleo
2135 2018-01-16 19:21:11 If knee jerks generated electricity, the Left could replace coal, oil and gas.
2136 2018-01-16 19:21:10 Big investment banks are raising their price targets on oil as crude futures hit levels not seen since December 2014.

***TOL traders***
2138 2018-01-16 19:20:59 Lmao nah. Like the oil change thing you said was a bit much. But letting a girl go with you to run errands sometimes, would be cool for her lol
2139 2018-01-16 19:20:48 It’s about time. Why doesn’t the spirit of Xeres I RISE UP IN Persia today and take that Bastard Nation’s oil away from them???
2140 2018-01-16 19:20:31 Oil of Olay?
2141 2018-01-16 19:20:23 Yeah. Like driving out the "rich foreign farmers" because they are "rich" but were the breadbasket of the company. Driving out the "rich foreign oil" people because they are "rich" but were the producer of the country's revenue.  Yeah, "eating the rich" not at ALL related.
2142 2018-01-16 19:20:18 Chick fil a tater tots trash. Be drowning in oil. #letsargue
2143 2018-01-16 19:20:18 I'll take, "...because the saudi's know america enslaved by consumption with consumption of oil at the top of the list..." for $300 Alex...Alex? um his eyes are rolling but in different directions...oops brain salad surgeries gone wrong
2144 2018-01-16 19:20:16 More than electric cars. It is the electrification of the current petro complex. Oil is never going away. The change needed is marginal. Price will react dynamically. Rare earth is a problem. Will probably be eventually stopped technologically
2145 2018-01-16 19:20:07 Bruh!!! Someone tell me why I made an appointment to get my oil change and I've still been waiting here at the dealership for an hour???
2146 2018-01-16 19:19:56 Big Picture: Between 2014 and today, oil demand increased and share of oil in global energy mix increased as well via: @IEABirol
2147 2018-01-16 19:19:51 @broightergold  Hi Leona, I phoned earlier and left a message. I sent in an order recently for 2 sprays and 2 bottles of oil but received only 1 spray. Can you check please.

2156 2018-01-16 19:18:28 Highest of all manufactured batteries i'd assume from the context. It's not even comparing to oil refining.
2157 2018-01-16 19:18:24 Oprah is almost as unfit to be president as Trump, and has been America's biggest snake oil merchant for decades, please stop trying to make her happen, thanks.
2158 2018-01-16 19:18:18 ~felt in the days before Glory finally caught up to them. It was an oppressive feeling - anxiety bubbling up in her lower stomach like hot oil, threatening to make her sick. She lifted the back of her hand to her forehead, expecting to feel~
2159 2018-01-16 19:18:17 United States replaced the gold standard with the military standard protecting arabs and arabs selling oil only in dollar.. but what they cant imagine was China being a giant too and news sources of energy

2161 2018-01-16 19:18:05 this gives me anxiety lol  

a legit soap that doesn't strip too much (which they almost all do), lot of tea and minimal sugar, and coconut oil and apple cider vinegar on every meal that will allow it is major 

bless
2162 2018-01-16 19:18:01 I‘m sure oil spills too. Oh wait, who just made drilling offshore easier?
2163 2018-01-16 19:17:46 U can try coconut oil ,olive oil, argan oil or a shea moisture product
2164 2018-01-16 19:17:44 Has anyone tried Oil Pulling for teeth?
2165 2018-01-16 19:17:34 Big banks raise oil price targets on strong demand and OPEC output cuts #Forex
2166 2018-01-16 19:17:33 Yeah they need Jesus and oil over there tbh
2167 2018-01-16 19:17:29 IMO It would take at least 2 dozen of those Mega-Dozers oil companies use in the tarsands to shovel away all the BullShit dropped on the Congress floor by these Republican SLIMEBALLS
2168 2018-01-16 19:17:21 The International Energy Agency's head, @IEABirol, is skeptical about 'peak oil demand' based on the overall growth of oil demand & as percentage of overall energy demand
2169 2018-01-16 19:17:11 Wow.  It looks exactly like the oil refinery in my parents' home town in Oklahoma.  Same technology... different distillate.
2170 2018-01-16 19:17:10 Crunchy babes: I’m looking to change my coconut oil brand. Do any of you have a go-to favorite? I’ve primarily used Trader Joe’s and/or Nutiva but I want to try something new! thanks in advance

2172 2018-01-16 19:16:48 $BA 31 pe for a cyclical business it's two time what it should be so I buy a 340 put on that. higher oil price and borrow rate + lower dollars will slow the demand.
2173 2018-01-16 19:16:44 What’s the castor oil do
2174 2018-01-16 19:16:33 Asked about what extra steps can be taken to put pressure on #NorthKorea, @BorisJohnson says better enforcement of sanctions, more oil sanctions. #KoreanPeninsula
2175 2018-01-16 19:16:09 Question, and not rhetorical, I'm asking because you're in the industry. Doesn't WTO have rules on how much oil can be in reserves to regulate pricing and don't we already produce more than we're supposed to? Is the coastal drilling worth the risk of losing billions in tourism $?
2176 2018-01-16 19:16:08 The number is likely higher, but don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.
2177 2018-01-16 19:16:08 Their cause, and pretend you hurt, be four thousand in them, he stood among them, Because I have kissed him: and 50 mg of oil.
2178 2018-01-16 19:16:08 Try olive oil. It will shake you.
2179 2018-01-16 19:16:06 If @KamalaHarris wants to preach about virtues she should start by crossing her legs.
2180 2018-01-16 19:15:52 Birol includes NGL and possibly biofuel in his "oil" stream. See if you can get crude oil production under 45 API @mattpiotrowski @staunovo
2181 2018-01-16 19:15:44 i got new oil, a new battery, and my power steering fixed im unstoppable now
2182 2018-01-16 19:15:38 i wanna swim in coconut oil
2183 2018-01-16 19:15:31 They wouldn’t want the oil capital of Europe in the EU? Ok enjoy Brexit.
2184 2018-01-16 19:15:21 Not to mention basing a state on oil is the worst thing you can do for the planet.
2185 2018-01-16 19:15:14 I can't go into some restaurants because the oil in the air from cooking makes it hard to breathe. 
2186 2018-01-16 19:15:08 Why then are they in such a hurry to expand offshore drilling? Seems the market price of oil will be falling has it become a lot cheaper to extract oil from the sea floor?
2187 2018-01-16 19:15:02 The warlock kept working on Kalliah's hair. Slowly rubbing in the oil in. She started humming softly.

"So tell me. Do you like your Scars?"
2188 2018-01-16 19:15:01 I needa go get this oil change and I can’t get up this bed.
2189 2018-01-16 19:14:57 It matters *what* you produce and *who* profits from it. In the case of Venezuela, oil is the backbone of their economy, the profits of which go to the elite. To call that "socialism" is absurd.
2190 2018-01-16 19:14:50 That's a big fat lie,we know Americans would be there always looting js like they loot oil in Africa...
2191 2018-01-16 19:14:38 oil pulling is gonna be the death of me. i hate coconut oil
2192 2018-01-16 19:14:36 MCT Oil >
2193 2018-01-16 19:14:29 Haha okay! I don’t even sense the smell as unique probably ‘cause I grew on it. Coconut oil is wonderful too! That is my grandma’s go-to amswer for everything 
2194 2018-01-16 19:14:27 When you have access to massive oil reserves it’s easier to subsidize your populations than it is for nations without commodifiable resources in the ground.
2195 2018-01-16 19:14:25 polecam całym sercem oil tree(5ml) z The body shopu, zazwyczaj jak posmaruje pryszcza wieczorem, rano i wieczorem to następnego ranka juz go nie ma lub jest maluutki, olejek kosztuje co prawda 25zl ale dawno nie miałam czegoś tak super
2196 2018-01-16 19:14:15 What is this magical oil that you're talking about
2197 2018-01-16 19:14:14 The maintenance of the tear stain thing is cos of her crossed breeding fur combo. and it helps to do a maintained fur trim to mask , and yet then not TOO much washing off because that removes oil from skin ;)
2198 2018-01-16 19:14:11 In that "jobs created and saved" kinda math. It's #science!

2201 2018-01-16 19:13:40 Wow! I hope that you were not driving! Many Angelenos don't even consider all the oil that's accumulated on streets during the dry months before the first winter rains come. What a mess.
2202 2018-01-16 19:13:30 slice of good tomato + slice of good mozzarella + a basil leaf & maybe a light drizzle of good olive oil

2206 2018-01-16 19:13:25 If we have crude Oil but import petrol...so peace can reign

we can also have cows and import beef so peace can reign.

2225 2018-01-16 19:11:01 BBH 1/4: There is nothing quite like a falling dollar to spur take of the erosion of the greenback's reserve status.  There has been talk for several months that China is preparing in yuan-denominated oil contract (with an embedded gold option). #dollar #yuan #forex #fx
2226 2018-01-16 19:11:00 is that oil brand oil? i can't believe you're springing for that
2227 2018-01-16 19:10:59 honestly coconut oil is so good for the soul

2231 2018-01-16 19:10:40 Wasn't there supposed to be a billion dollar oil refinery built in Harare? I vividly remember reading about in the Herald and getting excited..

New me broke with 96 credit hours and a car that’s dying for an oil change.
2233 2018-01-16 19:10:37 His son wasn't a soldier. He was a mercenary for the corporations. He murdered or partnered in murdering human beings for money and privilege so that his masters could get oil and other resources. His salary was paid, and he got what he deserved.

2236 2018-01-16 19:10:21 Pero es absolutamente bestial el punto de confirmación de los sectores US, con la elevada sobrecompra habida. Que tiren los Basic Material y Oil and Gas es muy notable. El transporte Marítimo A TOPE!

2240 2018-01-16 19:09:47 Well, Oil spikes precede recessions really. 2019 best candidate.
2241 2018-01-16 19:09:47 If we didn't start wars so Cheney's companies, oil companies and security companies could all get massively rich we wouldn't be so in debt and in need of money. War are waged for the rich to get richer. Cause killing millions isn't freedom.
2242 2018-01-16 19:09:45 @IEABirol says Btwn 2014, when peak oil demand story started, and today, oil demand increased and share of oil in global energy mix increased as well. Important point but wonder if it says more about the past than the future...#CSISLive
2243 2018-01-16 19:09:35 In addition to the sale at AutoZone on oil yesterday, I had a 20 dollar credit... 

This resulted in my total being 13.33..

Full synthetic oil change for 13 bucks? Do t mind if I fucking do 
2244 2018-01-16 19:09:34 Up till DJT nobody complained. Using thse descriptors made it easier to appropriate aid $. 
Now all the sudden it's racist or something.

2250 2018-01-16 19:08:36 Ask for a Thai (with oil) from UrbanMassage (app) - mishka is really good
2251 2018-01-16 19:08:25 I appreciate what LT does, but the BAN law is just stupid. the UK ban concerned 15 people included US and 2 RUS. The waiting list of 46 people : 22US and ...0 Rus. Do not put oil (gaz) on fire. LT is not credible (wiki sources)
2252 2018-01-16 19:08:04 big oil BOUGHT VOTES to protect some sort of power you know? and if they find out i know this stuff im dead
2253 2018-01-16 19:08:01 Hi Ryan - It does not include vinegar, oil, or mayo unless specified.
2254 2018-01-16 19:08:00 just a little life tip... oil paints r fuckin delicious. drink up, sluts.
2255 2018-01-16 19:07:53 Adding a turbo to a piston crank is not the right way to fix a piston crank.  Piston is static.  Turbo is dynamic.  Oil and water don't mix.  Turbo and piston don't mix.  
My engine has none of these issues.

2260 2018-01-16 19:07:22 I would still recommend any of those treatments but that issue may be a hyperpigmentation issue depending on the sensitivity of your skin which I recommend you find out I would try diluting some Teatree oil or serum ! I use to have a similar problem hope you find what works 
2261 2018-01-16 19:07:21 Yes, oil was a big part of their economy. But capitalism helped them to be more than just an oil based economy. Not to mention, you can’t diversify an economy if it is not a free market (also caused by socialism). So no matter how you look at it, socialism is the cause.
2262 2018-01-16 19:07:17 Silver or gold? Pearl or lace? Oil or BUTTER, Bobby?
2263 2018-01-16 19:06:53 For decades this term/ others have accurately described them with agreement from all. Made it easier to dole out 40 bil + yr to aid.
2264 2018-01-16 19:06:50 Code for where’s my Coconut oil cuz I’ve got a rager rn 
2265 2018-01-16 19:06:42 One more day to see if it 'clears up' but if not I've got a really good dentist. My work colleagues will make sure of that, my constant clove oil application is the stuff of legend....thank you!
2266 2018-01-16 19:06:21 Actually, that's BALONEY too, as I stated above. IndyRef people ALWAYS made a point of saying that 'OIL IS A BONUS' to Scottish economy. Only some people now like to keep repeating Indy based their sums on it. They didn't, if you had REALLY followed Indy issue.
2267 2018-01-16 19:06:10 Haha I’ll see what I can do. I already made room for extra virgin olive oil and wine, so what’s a few risotto balls?
2268 2018-01-16 19:06:08 To cut bld sugar/insulin surge after carbs, eat w/ fat (nuts, avocado, hlthy oil), lemon jc/vinegar splash, or high-fiber beans. #BeyondGI
2269 2018-01-16 19:06:00 "Electric cars are skyrocketing," says @IEABirol. But trucks, petrochemicals, aviation/shipping drive future oil demand. Time to tackle these demand drivers! #CSISLive #WEO2017
2270 2018-01-16 19:05:59 tbh pretty floored it's not more spoons of oil and definitely feeling much better about my diet of pizza/pasta/pizza/pasta
2271 2018-01-16 19:05:59 Nazarbayev is a Communist dictator, buddy of Putin who controls the wealth, oil, and oil pipelines of Kazakhstan.

Putin and Trump are the true Fake News perps.
2272 2018-01-16 19:05:43 Well it would stop the oil pipelines. I would think they could do it but they would be slaughtered by haters.
2273 2018-01-16 19:05:42 I dumped a whole bunch of baby oil in my diaper, and boy does that feel interesting o///o
2274 2018-01-16 19:05:29 Why are the guys at jiffy lube so loud an annoying, it makes getting my oil changed even worse 
2275 2018-01-16 19:05:27 It definitely was. The Huaorani people have since had to close down their eco lodge due to oil interests. Heartbreaking. We'll cherish our time there forever and always...
2276 2018-01-16 19:05:27 It counts for nought but I slotted some market just before 3pm. Market is very over cooked. Everyone I know is Long Small mid cap oil. A healthy retracement is coming
2277 2018-01-16 19:05:22 We’ve known this since the 80’s. 
What have you done for us lately, BIG OIL??
#CleanEnergyNOW
2278 2018-01-16 19:05:02 I'll see what I can find. I thought I heard Bobby Mac mention that Ebs wanted out. He didn't say "request trade" but he all but said it. I think both Ebs and the Oilers didn't want to ruin his Oil legacy by saying it publicly. That last line is again speculation, to be fair.
2279 2018-01-16 19:04:59 But with recession we may be have some OPEC hedge ( with economic slowdown treats /demand problems, they have big experience like 2009 cuts) + recessions almost always accompanied with big oil spikes. So risk/reward quite good
2280 2018-01-16 19:04:56 I left my office to get an oil change and ended up at Krispy Kreme, wheretheydodatat
2281 2018-01-16 19:04:53 1. Gold prices rise to reflect the GOR arb available (devaluing the USD.)
2. USD oil prices fall to reflect the GOR arb available (if USD/Gold remains pegged), hurting high cost USD-based oil producers like shale & reducing global Petrodollar supplies needed to fund US deficits.
2282 2018-01-16 19:04:52 There's no one I want to lather up in baby oil more than rick stein - culinary sex god
2283 2018-01-16 19:04:50 yeah and pretty easy to take care of: a little vegetable oil and some hot water.
2284 2018-01-16 19:04:22 My hope is that the oil companies go at it and unravel the CO2 con on the record in full public view. My fear is that they will roll over and settle to avoid the media sh*tstorm from the #green brigade.
Which option is better for business is the question.
2285 2018-01-16 19:04:19 Wheeling & dealing at the oil change place. Mostly just dealing. Well pretty much just doing what they suggest but there is talk of a coupon.
2286 2018-01-16 19:03:46 National Bank of Canada 1/2: Oil prices have been on a tear since last summer as an improving global  economy helped absorb excess supply of the commodity. Does that mean WTI  oil is heading to $70/barrel or higher?  #forex #oil #WTI #OilPrice
2287 2018-01-16 19:03:33 So im taking an autotech/automotive class and im really happy that i am because i can literally get my car checked up for free... free oil changes, tire rotations etc etc... loving it

2289 2018-01-16 19:02:32 Why do couples say "We're pregnant!" Like nah bitch it's not we, it's me.
2290 2018-01-16 19:02:31 Why do my ears collect so much more oil than my face ohmygod

In the shower I have to soap and re-soap the inner lobes like I'm wiping my ass after the first shit after drinking tequila all night.
2291 2018-01-16 19:02:20 is there no OIL in that country?
2292 2018-01-16 19:02:06 Oil of cloves

2304 2018-01-16 19:00:29 well it rarely rans here in cali, and the roads are really dirty, so when it rains all the dirt, oil, grease, and other car fluids make the roads a bit slick. plus people dont change their tires as much as they really should so they dont grip wet road surfaces well.

2315 2018-01-16 19:00:00 Daily this market is showing more and more signs of manipulation. Nat gas, gold, oil are prime targets
2316 2018-01-16 18:59:55 The real question is why did the uk gov allow oil companies to operate in the North Sea without a commitment to decommissioning and environmental reinstatement plan .  Unless that is they took any deal going just to get money into a failing economy , similar to carillon
2317 2018-01-16 18:59:50 I have a hard time looking forward to Phil Murphy's leadership: he still comes across as an oil slick wearing a suit.  But on the bright side, Chris Christie now has so many hours to hang up on radio show callers.

When's the first live beach remote?
2318 2018-01-16 18:59:39 Ok. Maybe a build in a week or two. We've still been getting bearish EIAs that the loons keep ignoring anyway. Reality will hit them hard. I have my material ready for all the characters we've encountered here once we are vindicated. They'll have to sue me :)

2322 2018-01-16 18:58:59 just saying "Chris Christie" makes me feel like my tongue has been sweating oil
2323 2018-01-16 18:58:54 Transnational gangsters and oil lords paid for his campaign and PR and his voters elected someone to torment the minorities they loathe, no wonder they are the happiest with the direction of governance since Bush.

2326 2018-01-16 18:58:15 Quite true about their oil riches. Canada, where I'm from, has benefited from exporting lots of oil too, and has similarly high per-capita C02 emissions!
2327 2018-01-16 18:58:09 Clove Oil on the go, with a side order of Codeine. 
2328 2018-01-16 18:57:57 Venezuela’s economic troubles is rooted in the lack of diversity in their economy. When oil was at a high price, they thrived. Now it’s down, and they don’t have anything else to help bring their economy up.
2329 2018-01-16 18:57:57 Shell aclara que subió un 6% y no un 8% sus combustibles en todo el país. También acompañó Oil. YPF, si aumenta, trasladará sin anunciar. Habrá que mirar surtidores.

2339 2018-01-16 18:57:13 Rayne poured a plenty of the oil onto her hand and started rubbing it into Kalliah's raven hair. Making it nice and shiny.
2340 2018-01-16 18:56:49 Productive day off. Oil change. Hair cut. New set of nails. 
2341 2018-01-16 18:56:39 You need to work on the chemistry with Liz. You guys are like oil & water and it sounds ice cold over the airwaves
2342 2018-01-16 18:56:31 En uno de los intros de la serie británica Peaky Blinders inicia con Snake Oil de Foals.
2343 2018-01-16 18:56:26 Kalliah seated herself on the edge of the tub and waited for Rayne to start with the oil.
2344 2018-01-16 18:56:20 I tried adding oil but she hates it, and she gets excited about eggs but then doesn't want them. But since she has this food, she's been chatty and cuddly.
2345 2018-01-16 18:56:18 Try: Fresh ground organic coffee (from a clean island) use method you like best.

2346 2018-01-16 18:56:17 It is  a  2 day volume as we did not have a settlement yesterday.
2347 2018-01-16 18:56:04 Yes. But they cannot control price without controlling supply. Since since they control neither supply or price in gold or oil. It makes cny oil contract an convenience to them. Not a re-ordering of the world.
2348 2018-01-16 18:56:00 Does that not say something about how positive/truthful he is? I interpret that to mean he was negative/untruthful 90% of the time in 2017, including all the lies that you guys burned the night oil defending. He can improve that number in 2018. His destiny is in his hands.
2349 2018-01-16 18:55:41 Oil market volume is doomed. Because nobody like contaminated streams and lakes. The ocean been polluted by oil drilling. The air is our breath.
2350 2018-01-16 18:55:27 I get this, but recall that Norway, that near-utopia that I also admire, is a rich petro-state. Their per-capita CO2 emissions, if you count the oil and gas exports, are some of the highest in the world. Awesome social programs are easier with huge oil wealth sloshing around.

2368 2018-01-16 18:53:30 Maybe this is the week we see a crude build. That would scare away some of the non-oil-regular-trading money. Then of course we have the benchmark of 10 million bpd from the US very soon, which will begin to make the oil-regulars nervous :)

2370 2018-01-16 18:53:25 But still your Congress will not win as MMS follows PIDI strategy. This Central govt have been smart enough in building strategic reserves on oil when the price were low. Long-term low oil prices could lead to deflation in many countries that are dependent on oil sales revenue.

No nation has a oil monopoly. So “deciding” value only makes macro guys rich. Either in oil, or in the currency of valuation

2475 2018-01-16 18:41:07 The only problem is groundnut oil cannot be consumed in its cold-pressed form. Its taste is not pleasant. It has to be refined - and this means all its nutritional value is gone. However, #MustardOil is cold pressed and hence retains all its natural goodness.

2499 2018-01-16 18:37:39 The challenge with that is oil and gas subsidies will never disappear. They're too powerful, but on that level, I completely agree. I actually think both nuclear and renewable could stand on their own if O&G weren't so heavily subsidized through the tax code.
2500 2018-01-16 18:37:31 So i have dry skin too sis  i always go with ponds dry skin cream and i brought this oil from Sephora by Josie Maran, it’s pretty pricey but it helps my skin a lot!

I also create fine weavings (throws, scarves, shawls, table runners, etc.)  All weavings are created with fine wools such as: Merino wool, Churro wool and other natural fibers.
2509 2018-01-16 18:36:39 And also the price of heating oil is crazy expensive this year.

2512 2018-01-16 18:36:16 In d '60 n '70 agribusiness was in things in Nig. Our economy was more buoyant, then came Oil. And farmlands n settlements were deserted n more hunger crept in our national life.. Oil bring more money n more poverty inversely. Lets' return to d basis. 1/2
2513 2018-01-16 18:36:09 Venezuela was a leftist Goverment ..full of corruption, destroyed a rich country with largest oil deposits. Democracy gone and now people are starving ? Do we want this?

2518 2018-01-16 18:35:20 I just recommend exfoliating, a very hydrating moisturizer overnight, and an oil controlling primer where it's oily

2532 2018-01-16 18:33:00 It did...and it curbs your appetite a bit. I like it for joint health but I’m considering adding a spoonful of coconut oil to see what it adds.

2542 2018-01-16 18:32:08 In principle a good call, but you would be a hypocrite with oil money if you don’t mention #Yemen war, #saudi limited civil rights for women, #UAE support of terror groups. No double standards you know. Do you do that?
2543 2018-01-16 18:32:00 But first we need to agree & land on a common plan that accepts re-directing global subsidies from oil & gas to renewables.
2544 2018-01-16 18:31:59 Bolt a fuel tank in the back of it and throw a couple jugs of oil couple took box’s sliding around in it then you can call it a truck and don’t forget the tube of grease that you can step on to give it the used look
2545 2018-01-16 18:31:48 For all the deals that you said just now, if we are to do them we need some surplus cash. This is that cash. 
We don't have oil rich owners or business deals in Czechoslovakia to fund the transfer and the wages.

2550 2018-01-16 18:31:00 U probably already know this I'm sure but oil producing countries no longer using USD/petrodollar. No recourse but return to gold standard. So buy what you like but don't buy gold!

2565 2018-01-16 18:28:50 Maybe not, but any oil floating on surface needs to be removed if possible.
2566 2018-01-16 18:28:40 The real issue is OPEC don't want oil at this price as it makes US shale profitable & many offshore fields too. They want a steady USD 60 a barrel so they can plan & budget. They don't want it this high as it will encourage supply & force they price down below USD 60.
2567 2018-01-16 18:28:39 We compel foreign jurisdictions to give us oil. How do we do that?

2606 2018-01-16 18:23:52 Perfect energy storm in Canada. We lose $30 a barrel in oil revenue because we have no effective transportation. Other countries are filling their coffers. There should be an opt-out checkbox for social services for Canadians who oppose energy sales.

2610 2018-01-16 18:23:26 Paulie had this great system where he'd cut up the tide laundry pods with a razor blade. He would get them so thin that they would liquify in the pan with just a little bit of oil.

2627 2018-01-16 18:20:36 Putin funds terrorism, attacks Western democracies, has invaded sovereign European nations, is providing oil and technology to North Korea, murders opposition wherever they are in the world, and combined with his cronies has stolen trillions from the Russian people. So, NO!

It is roughly $70.
This scam is minimizing the true realization.

2637 2018-01-16 18:19:12 I need to buy a new coconut oil
2638 2018-01-16 18:19:11 君を揚げたいな…君を炒めたいな…君に僕を絡めたいな…僕は君のそんな存在になりたい。いや、既になってるだろう?
2639 2018-01-16 18:19:05 Little life update for you guys. A couple weeks ago, my coconut oil ran out, and I didn’t have the time to buy a new jar. As a natural, I have a lot of oils, some doubles because of a sale that was on a while ago.
2640 2018-01-16 18:18:51 Not a problem when we have a fiat currency and things like oil are priced in $.
2641 2018-01-16 18:18:43 If it’s extra virgin olive oil of course yes, pepperoni is what’s problematic if you really wanna look into it
2642 2018-01-16 18:18:42 Exactly also it’s extra virgin olive oil what’s the problem

2645 2018-01-16 18:18:18 What about the Northern border. I’m suspicious of those Canadians. What if they decide to invade Maine or possibly Montana. Trump you better build a Great Wall to protect us from Canadian low cost drugs, oil,wheat and beer. Without a big wall we’ll be exposed to Canadian Health!

2649 2018-01-16 18:17:36 Beauty products have always been a hit or miss type thing. Since the age of 15 & now 48, I have always relied on Noxzema, Seabreeze, Oil of Olay and Ponds cold cream. No photoshop add will make me change what works for my skin. 
2650 2018-01-16 18:17:36 Thanks David - I'm hoping, as it progresses, the project will show the diversity of the coastline, from its refineries, fishing, military occupation, ship building, oil etc let's see how it goes :)

2652 2018-01-16 18:17:25 I got tickets to an oil kings game, but have not found anyone yet. Don't know if I should be nice and give them to someone or should I just not use them and have spare tickets for other games
2653 2018-01-16 18:17:18 Peppermint oil is good for headaches. Not sure how effective it would be for migraines.

2655 2018-01-16 18:17:07 Ever since I got my first facial a few weeks ago I’ve been very conscious of the foods and drinks I consume to keep my skin lookin fresh. Lots of fruits, veggies and tea lately, not to mention the use of tea tree oil.
2656 2018-01-16 18:17:05 I think we can both agree that oil/gas (natural gas in particular) subsidies are harming the viability of energy diversity of the country, squeezing other energy sources out of the competitive market.

2674 2018-01-16 18:13:54 This morning i spilled espresso all down myself and im sitting here waiting for my oil change and i smell literally so bad
2675 2018-01-16 18:13:49 It will come with outside money from Nike, Donors, etc. This is just what the univ is on the hook for.

for example, RR was getting $6M~ in oil money over the life of his contract
2676 2018-01-16 18:13:39 The bible says my people perish because of lack of knowledge not lack of anointing oil 
2677 2018-01-16 18:13:35 Yeah they can't sit back waiting when most factors are shouting for rate increases. When shit hits the fan they need some room to potentially bring rates down to settle the market and just pray inflation doesnt take off when that happens. Oil is still a massive wildcard right now
2678 2018-01-16 18:13:24 Kung minina na lang ng Pilipinas ang oil & gas sa West Philippines Sea at pinakinabangan ang mga isda at inexport, hindi na sana kailangan magtaas pa ng tax at mangutang ng bilyun-bilyun sa Tsina. Di ba?

2680 2018-01-16 18:13:16 I'm not defending/ advocating anything. I am just frustrated by the level of ignorance amongst ppl on twitter. Having been a socialist and lived in ex socialist countries, I find the notion that Norway or its oil industry is socialist shockingly ignorant.
2681 2018-01-16 18:13:14 wtf does the temperature of the oil have to do with it lmao

2685 2018-01-16 18:13:09 How do you use the tee tree oil do you mix it with something? By the way your skin is popping oe!
2686 2018-01-16 18:13:07 Bitfinex and their tethers can go fuck themselves. Fragmented markets are hard to price (like trading coffee or oil). You just need to use the same chart for each technical, and make sure they're high volume exchanges.

2692 2018-01-16 18:12:04 Instead of destroying our environment by sucking more at the oil teat why don't we invest in infrastructure that would get us away from there? I've been saying this for so long

2698 2018-01-16 18:11:15 It's all about insulation Sam, my pool studio takes about 30mins of an oil filled radiator on medium  and it will stay warm all day if the door isn't opened !
2699 2018-01-16 18:11:15 Just made it up. But I found out later there is an Oil Trough, Arkansas so I might have unconsciously saved it somewhere along the way. Oil Trough had a pop of just 3. Me, my cousin Clutch and my great grandpa Sagebrush. Long story.
2700 2018-01-16 18:11:07 i feel like pizza has more calories than 3 tbsp of oil
2701 2018-01-16 18:11:06 Statoil is one of a number of oil companies in Norway. This set up is not unusual. In many capitalist economies the state owns or partially owns companies which participate in an industry. That does not make the industry socialist. Nor the state socialist.
2702 2018-01-16 18:10:42 Oil/massage inside & once I get out

When I’m inside I massage my body as I cleanse to relax my muscles

When I get out I’m oiling up

2708 2018-01-16 18:09:39 Popping open the top of the bottle, Kalliah squirted out a small amount and set out to rub the oil into her friend's lustrous locks.

2709 2018-01-16 18:09:32 @ChevyCustCare had a noon appointment for an oil change @byerschevy and my Traverse is still sitting, waiting to go back to service area. #whymakeanappointment
2710 2018-01-16 18:09:27 Almost funny that Obama tried to shut down oil, but US Production reaches 10 million barrels a day. Expect to hit 11 million in 2019.
2711 2018-01-16 18:09:25 I honestly think they just can't keep up because I talk fast and say words like oil correctly. They all think I say 2,7,and 10 completely wrong they never understand it.
2712 2018-01-16 18:09:20 Acha Ek question ka jawab de . Koi islamic country bata jo  oil ke paise ke  bina tarraki ki ho.
2713 2018-01-16 18:09:18 yes-that is what I have been saying. If the question is-is Norway closer to socialism than USA-then the answer is obviously yes. If the statement is, made by U and others that Norway is either (democratic) socialist, or their oil industry is socialist, then u are clearly wrong.
2714 2018-01-16 18:09:16 Shea butter whip, some Jamaican castor oil, some skincare products, a travel hamper and a hair accessory like a silk do-rag? Is this too much? Am I being selfish?  the next question, what do we need to do to WIN

2731 2018-01-16 18:06:40 i got so excited to stop smoking cigarettes but my mom sent a package with my vape juice and no vape and apparently she thought the juice was essential oil and she threw out my vape two months ago, considering it paraphernalia!!!
2732 2018-01-16 18:06:39 Also it's 3 spoons. Not like they're saying its 3 drums of oil or some shit.
2733 2018-01-16 18:06:29 Do people at instant oil changes actually get the stuff they recommend? Like I’m here for my $50 20 min oil change but sure, let me sit for another hour and pay $600.
2734 2018-01-16 18:06:24 I bags the first bottle of cold pressed extra virgin sunflower oil.
2735 2018-01-16 18:06:13 Sitting on the edge of the bathtub Rayne watched Kalliah use the oil first.

"You first."

2737 2018-01-16 18:06:02 Medium: Oil
2738 2018-01-16 18:05:51 That's because Stashe is an establishment candidate who's funded by big oil pipeline companies. He knows he can't take a chance of being asked hard questions. Why do you think he refuses to debate with @CathyMyersWI?
2739 2018-01-16 18:05:48 i tried for the first the peanut butter  that has a the seperated oil on top that you need to mix and i wasnt crazy about it but maybe itll be better after being in the fridge
2740 2018-01-16 18:05:45 Of course, but that argument ignores the $100+ billion nuclear has received in both direct and indirect subsidies (R&D, design/build, and operation) since 1948. It also ignores the $40-$50 billion per year in oil and gas subsidies.

2747 2018-01-16 18:04:31 His healthcare made insurance premiums sky rocket. Having insurance is no good if you can’t afford to use it. Insurance companies had to close down because the government couldn’t pay their part. And we are still dependent upon foreign oil. Not sure where you got that one.
2748 2018-01-16 18:04:29 Gum stuck in hair? Use olive oil to comb it out
2749 2018-01-16 18:04:26 You gotta have a go-to bogey man excuse. One of my first jobs, I always walked around with a brad hammer and can of boiled linseed oil. If the big boss saw me he'd think I was on the way to fix something and would invariably say "keep up the good work!"
2750 2018-01-16 18:04:23 He’s actually doing a terrible job at socialism. The problem is the countries reliance on oil as their main export which is down to $55 a barrel. And the inflation doesn’t help. Not a socialist, I just understand economics better than you apparently.
2751 2018-01-16 18:04:09 We do not have a lack of oil. The reason why gas prices increased was due to the deregulation of oil. Oil used to be a commodity and was regulated by the govt. Once it was deregulate it went on the stock exchange. We are paying for the imaginary future cost of oil which is BS.

2766 2018-01-16 18:02:30 I understand what you’re saying. But after having a serial sexual assaulted, a grabber, a charlatan, a snake oil salesman, a traitor, a russian mole as potus, do we need to think twice, considering men like @RepJoeKennedy qualified to be pouts? These aren’t normal times.

2777 2018-01-16 18:01:51 Far-right hanky panky 1way-pricing will hit people now. 

When global oil price falls heavy 
the domestic fuel price is reduced peanuts or frozen. 

When global oil price climbs 
the domestic fuel price will be cranked up higher.
2778 2018-01-16 18:01:45 However, in Norway BIG OIL subsidizes nationalized health care. Everyone benefits from resources found under the country's soil. Not just a few billionaires and the politicians doing their dirty work #gop #texas #fail
2779 2018-01-16 18:01:41 Thatcher won that rebate by hard negotiation, bless her. They weren't handing them out like Smarties. We had a say up until a bunch of xenophobes and Snake Oil Salesmen came along. But you keep Right on Truckin Jim !

2796 2018-01-16 17:59:55 So less oil.. I guess it can't bring the actual taste. Can I use some more oil !!
2797 2018-01-16 17:59:44 Thanks,it’s really difficult to get accurate figures on death of livestock,in local media leaders are quoted as saying tens of thousands but good article,Sophie’s article on oil in Turkana is quite rich & very enlightening

" We don't need them." 
Fairly undefined, and worrisome.
2804 2018-01-16 17:58:41 That would be appropriate if you lived in a world where engines were seizing and cars were breaking down because  people denied the need for car maintenance and oil changes. See the difference?

2807 2018-01-16 17:57:29 I hope that you diligently work as deep on the crimes and payments run thru Sierra Leone, thru Niger and Congo, Oil deals in Nigeria, arms deals in  Mali....and tag all the guilty names that you find.
2808 2018-01-16 17:57:18 I like it if there’s is also a mound of the herbs to accompany the oil
2809 2018-01-16 17:57:11 Trust me, not many people in Manipal follow the above diet pattern. Manipal usually employs a tikka-biryani-burger-oil-masala-fried formula on a regular basis.
2810 2018-01-16 17:56:56 @kristeevetter I started to write a super long comment on your last video & then decided not to. Feel your feelings, & maybe get a humidifer/diffuser - if diff, get some lavender oil to help sleep & Elevation oil (from Doterra) bc it smells awesome & (I think) help w mood!
2811 2018-01-16 17:56:37 I don’t know... maybe to shred, compress into paper bricks & use on the oil drum fire that the L&D team stand around after they’ve been ‘let go’
2812 2018-01-16 17:56:34 I just showed up to the car place for an oil change in scrubs pretending I had to be at work in an hour so they wouldn’t take all day and have my car #savage #itworked
2813 2018-01-16 17:56:33 Dispite what you may say about that snake oil salesman, His bully tactics are exactly what the hard right want. he is exposing America main weakness, The Democrats how have no spine. if they did cause a shutdown, the backlash would not be on the Democrats but the Republicians
2814 2018-01-16 17:56:29 This will be the last jar of coconut oil that I buy.

2834 2018-01-16 17:54:01 New York's governor urged the federal government Monday to exempt the state from a plan by President Donald Trump's administration to expand offshore oil and gas drilling, calling it "an unacceptable threat" to the state's heavily populated coastline.

2838 2018-01-16 17:53:33 I get that relationships in the biz world are convoluted, and Saudi Aramco probably has a biz connection to every oil biz in the country. But if the networks aren't co-owned or connected, how is Saudi Aramco the victim?

2843 2018-01-16 17:52:57 @osaeB the interesting part here is that it's coming at the back of rise in oil prices. What's the underlying reason?
2844 2018-01-16 17:52:56 I'm extremely sceptical of anything except folic acid and vit D for pregnancy. At best snake oil, at worst harmful...research into antioxidants for cancer patients had very worrying results.

2849 2018-01-16 17:52:00 Not to mention a person named "Kirstjen Nielsen" has no ideas about the racial make up of Scandinavian countries?  No ideas? 
"I, Mr Fabrizio Fusi, have no idea if you squeeze olives they give oil. I actually don't know that sir."

2852 2018-01-16 17:51:10 Hi Dan, can you point me to your position on Oil & Gas development and management?  Thank You.
2853 2018-01-16 17:51:04 Isreal exists there to serve American interst. The oil / energy lobby that can create depression in economies to create opportunities to American Inc., can also create boom in economies to create an exit with fat profits. Just business no emotional connect.

2858 2018-01-16 17:50:14 Hey Luis, all edible oils (including Brain Octane oil) react with certain plastics and should only be used w/ utensils and containers made of metal, glass, ceramic, or safe HDPE plastics. Hope that helps!
2859 2018-01-16 17:50:09 for example - Rosneft was named as victim of notPetya but actually Rosneft IT wasn't affected - only few oil production units in daughter companies.

2864 2018-01-16 17:49:23 Every time that Israel had military operations in Lebanon and were close to capturing Arafat, the United States rescued him and made Israel withdraw.  Now that we don't fear another oil embargo, maybe different next time.

2874 2018-01-16 17:48:31 Do you even have any idea how much Scotland would have to pay back to foreign companies and the UK for the return of all embedded oil infrastructure investment assets...even taking off a proportional fair share factor?

2878 2018-01-16 17:47:53 Got to wonder if #KirstjenNielsen knows anything about #Norway? Norway has womb to tomb socialism, 5 weeks paid vacation, free university & oil corps must give large share of profits to pay for social welfare programs. IE high taxes & socialism = "people work hard" @SecNielsen?

2880 2018-01-16 17:47:49 In UK, Coconut Oil is all the rage at the moment. Even if it means sticking your finger in a can to take out the frozen 'wonder' from the 'Indian state of Kerala'

2882 2018-01-16 17:47:45 I hope that would also include the oil/edibles, so those w/o a script could get benefits w/o the "high" factor
2883 2018-01-16 17:47:21 We're all highly influenced by marketing. Auto manufacturers spend $14 billion annually in the USA on advertising.  That's exclusive of spending from oil, leasing companies, dealers. Transit "industry," by comparison, has their annual "Dump the Pump Day."
2884 2018-01-16 17:47:21 When I was 8 a friend dared me to stick a plastic oil funnel in my mouth & I did & spat it out right away & thought I was slowly dying of oil poisoning for the next month. I learned early that foreign objects + dares = no dice.
2885 2018-01-16 17:47:19 Didn't coat taxpayers anything. aTm has over a billion dollar endowment fund paid for by oil money rich alumni.

2901 2018-01-16 17:45:43 Barbarossa was June '41. Axis had given up on Britain - could not see viable way of invading since we had air and sea superiority. Hitler needed Caucasus oil fields. Russia might well have lost without benefit of Bletchley decrypts and American materiel.

2917 2018-01-16 17:43:50 With the oil prices rising least is expected to make some change to destruction of economy. Fuel already 72. 2018 might wash away a mighty economy. 2020 dreams washed

2919 2018-01-16 17:43:32 What uses does coconut oil even have?
2920 2018-01-16 17:43:17 oil has been used to make them (so co2 released already) so give them to an old people's home who need them for their residents who need help drinking. But ask them to recycle carefully. As long as they're in the recycling they shouldn't get into the oceans. #EndOceanPlastics
2921 2018-01-16 17:43:16 don't tell me, you believe the GERS figures and that oil costs are running at a loss. Compare us to Norway. Less oil than us.
2922 2018-01-16 17:43:15 Try coconut oil instead of butter, tastes far better too!
2923 2018-01-16 17:43:14 SO ANYWAY I'm going to kill work.

5pm job.
Consigned to me at 5:05pm

It was as I threw the chicken in the oil, a notification went off. It was the e-mail.
2924 2018-01-16 17:43:10 Check your Transmission oil this morning.
2925 2018-01-16 17:43:08 Lynn Helms, North Dakota's top oil regulator, sees production climbing to 2 mil b/d within a decade. Depends on prices, capacity constraints, he says #OOTT
2926 2018-01-16 17:43:00 It looks like we are getting the largest red candle since mid December
2927 2018-01-16 17:42:58 What causes the #1 killer in the US?  MEAT, DAIRY and OIl.  Heart disease need never develop.  Whole food, plant based is the ONLY diet PROVEN to reverse heart disease progression... DUH!  Why isn't it recommended?  (answer: $$$)  sad.
2928 2018-01-16 17:42:54 lol these niggas got everything BUT that oil
2929 2018-01-16 17:42:47 In $DWT 11.61 for $USO #Oil pullback
2930 2018-01-16 17:42:46 I know that if you rub peppermint oil on your temple that’s supposed to help. 
2931 2018-01-16 17:42:39 Sitting at the auto body waiting for an oil change
Eating a container of rice I brought from home. Dont let an odd situation interfere with your lunch schedule! #TuesdayMotivation
2932 2018-01-16 17:42:29 Why Why Why would anyone do something as cruel as that. The poor dog. Hopefully that evil prick will have scalding oil poured over him one day 
2933 2018-01-16 17:42:07 New oil! Follow me on Instagram @anyalincolnart for more pics of the progress. :-)
2934 2018-01-16 17:42:05 Lmao leave am make she dey lie for olive oil head
2935 2018-01-16 17:41:48 Hi Bethenny have you tried Black Seed Oil I heard its good for flu and other elements we face in our bodies. Try it and see.
2936 2018-01-16 17:41:47 oil prices are up, Russia gets to sell new planes etc, and look like a Slate pitch: critics say Trump will suck the oxygen out of the room again, leave the ghouls gasping
2937 2018-01-16 17:41:45 We now have 2 convenient locations for all your automotive service and repair needs.  Basic repairs (brake jobs, tires, oil changes, etc.) will be performed at the newly acquired station and more extensive repairs will take place at our 65 S Orchard St shop. #fraunsmarathon

2940 2018-01-16 17:41:35 Today is not even Oil market day but see traffic 
2941 2018-01-16 17:40:57 Rayne then used her hands to ruffle her hair and wash them properly off the shampoo. Once it was done Rayne shook her head a little. Fixing her hair behind her back.

"Now the oil."
2942 2018-01-16 17:40:43 Anything you can make with regular flour such as biscuits, crepes etc, you can replace that with coconut flour. I added coconut milk and coconut oil into the mixture for extra taste too
2943 2018-01-16 17:40:38 Man every time I get an oil change. They always tryna set me up for failure smh
2944 2018-01-16 17:40:38 Don't you have access to a place that makes actual pizza? I'm not confident that soybean oil, xanthan gum, modified food starch, cellulose, and sodium propionate are effective heart medicine.
2945 2018-01-16 17:40:26 You have the enemy in the backyard China taking the gold from Venezuela and Russia the oil what a joke a wall is not going to stop them remember North Central and South is one AMERICA and one land stop dividing !!

2947 2018-01-16 17:40:20 "not an Aramco-branded" doesn't mean "not an Aramco-owned", right ? Is there any Aramco unrelated oil business in SA ?
2948 2018-01-16 17:40:19 I miss the styrofoam containers...
2949 2018-01-16 17:40:15 I love the face oil 
2950 2018-01-16 17:40:11 I recommend replacing cheese or other dairy fat with a rich veggie fat like olives or avocado. Also, there are tons of things you can do with cashews- cheese or cream sauce. You can also easily make vegan white sauce with olive oil, whole wheat flour and nut or soy milk-so good!

2953 2018-01-16 17:39:47 Never feed your dog can food or dry food.

Feed the boiled chicken with paste or rice. Be extremely careful to completely debone the chicken.

When they tummy problem boil ground beef with rice.

Dry foods have too much ass and wet, who the hell knows.

Too much mice too much oil
2954 2018-01-16 17:39:36 Going to get ready and go get my oil changed and go to Target. So exciting
2955 2018-01-16 17:39:27 Is that why JustinaJihad is buying their oil instead of using our own better cheaper oil?
APPEASEMENT!
2956 2018-01-16 17:39:26 Added one more oil to the collection. ‘Energy’ 
2957 2018-01-16 17:39:20 This is great news. Think of all the money I’m going to save on pizza, by drinking oil.
2958 2018-01-16 17:39:19 Not true because the oil on its own has no protein. The pizza has approx 14 grams of protein. Like dif between peanut oil and peanut butter, 7 grams protein.
2959 2018-01-16 17:39:00 Anyone remember when baseball and softball had the water gun/balloon/flour/cooking oil fight and everyone was getting water out of the fountain and on top of the buildings and crap?
2960 2018-01-16 17:38:52 Coconut oil is really for everything lol s/o @letsplaypretend
2961 2018-01-16 17:38:49 A friend gave me a dog shaped cookie cutter, so I wanted to give it a try. It was premade dough too, so should've been hard for me to mess up lol. I think the big issue was that I used some shitty non-butter to coat the tray with & it had too much oil in it, so they burnt & stuck
2962 2018-01-16 17:38:44 Well it’s not really the bills it’s the xtra shit like $500 to fix my car, $105 for an oil change . My phone bill is double this month cause it’s pro-rated 
2963 2018-01-16 17:38:37 OIL DIFF: 5.6 -> 5.64
2964 2018-01-16 17:38:30 I'd have no problem with that, but it's not just oil. They'd see lumber and mining go bye-bye as well
2965 2018-01-16 17:38:25 Norway productivity is based on the fact that it is a very small country and has a ton of cheap oil production. Take the oil away and it loses all luster.
2966 2018-01-16 17:38:17 I suggest you take a Valium.....what is your obsession with Alberta ?
There are no ME inventions, outside of Israel....w/o western oil companies, all ME Muslim countries would be still living in tents, riding camels.
Calling me names....doesn't strengthen your arguments.
2967 2018-01-16 17:38:03 @RobertGigante en 9 de julio pasa lo mismo, en enero no arreglan la están de vacaciones, en febrero no hay gas oil en marzo llueve, en abril está seco y así se las ingenian para cobrar y no arreglar un camino

2971 2018-01-16 17:37:38 Kazakhstan is tremendous tremendous. Unless you live there of course. Lots of oil. Tremendous oil. Respected president. Big winner. Heavyweight actually. Really really great.
2972 2018-01-16 17:37:35 And one more thing I may add is if Crude oil goes up it affects not just a football club it affects the world but you may have a agenda against Man City?
2973 2018-01-16 17:37:20 Exactly! And to be honest, if you can take an art class just do it. I'm considering to take a traditional art course about watercolor or oil painting in summer. I am also self taught, and when I was younger I didn't even consider doing this because I thought
2974 2018-01-16 17:37:19 Why tf is the other person who liked this an olive oil twitter
2975 2018-01-16 17:37:03 Which reminds me; we need to change the oil in the truck we use to tow Betsy.
2976 2018-01-16 17:36:35 oil nog yum
2977 2018-01-16 17:36:21 Might order some sprouts for my treatment room! The misunderstood vegetable of super powers stir fly with coconut oil, garlic, lime and ginger :-) yummy 
2978 2018-01-16 17:36:15 Yes, please give me the warm oil.
2979 2018-01-16 17:35:40 If anything 3tsp of oil is pretty dry...
2980 2018-01-16 17:35:19 I having a pizza for dinner washed down with extra oil. Mmmmmmm
2981 2018-01-16 17:35:17 Beard Oil is tried and true throughout your growth. Then as it grows you'll need to clean it with Wash + Softener, and keep it neat with a comb. Mustache Wax can help keep some hairs in place too. Long Story short, our Beginners Kit is probably what you're looking for.

2982 2018-01-16 17:35:09 Based on the details of the contract and the fact that Jeff Stevens was specifically thanked in the press conference, I have to think Kevin Sumlin is getting his own oil stock deal (a la Rich Rod, Sean Miller, and Greg Byrne)

2986 2018-01-16 17:34:41 Unfortunately my daughter’s Cannabis Oil to control her Seizures and the Ativan we use as a Rescue Medication are NOT covered.
2987 2018-01-16 17:34:29 Oil prices fall, but strong demand keeps Brent crude near $70 per barrel  #CrudeOil @CNBC
2988 2018-01-16 17:34:11 The oil and gas regulations you tout actually are squashing small companies in favor of big oil/gas. The less wells you operate the more you pay. These small companies live and work in our district and deserve better support in Washington.
2989 2018-01-16 17:33:57 $CL_F oil put in it's high 24 hours ago, so that was a clue. $ES_F $SPX $XLE
2990 2018-01-16 17:33:39 Would a looser regolith necessarily be helpful? Pit or trench sides would be shallower. If you're targeting (say) 3% water ice at 2-4m below surface, slumping could drop your effective yeild to 1.5%

Mining is a lot more than finding a deposit (says the oil geologist!)
2991 2018-01-16 17:33:38 At present, 25% of country’s oil demands are being fulfilled by Barmer. The refinery at Pachpadra is one step further towards the region’s development. #PMInRajasthan
2992 2018-01-16 17:33:31 There are people who would see that happen to Canada too... And I believe one of them is Prime Minister.

For better or worse, Canada's economy will always rely on resource extraction, be it oil or lumber. We have strict environmental laws around those, though
2993 2018-01-16 17:33:28 Chevron to restart #Kurdistan drilling ops. Coincidentally, Kurdistan troubles were the last story I wrote about before going on parental leave. Good to see #oil markets haven't changed much, and yet the fact that production is restarting means they have...
2994 2018-01-16 17:33:27 True!. Norwegians don't work very hard bc they don't have to- they have vast oil reserves and manage the profits very well
2995 2018-01-16 17:33:26 Folks, please pray for Trump and ask the Almighty to grant him wisdom and understanding. TBH, We don't need another 'Global-War' that will trigger oil prices to shoot, in excess of 200/= per Litre!

3007 2018-01-16 17:32:36 Hux is using the aphrodisiac massage oil on his achy shoulders and put on a ridiculous face mask. He heard a knock at the door and goes to retrieve his room service meal and when he opens the door it’s Kylo who’s there.
3008 2018-01-16 17:32:35 MLK Jr would not stay silent as #akleg steals $$ from the poor via theft of our PFD and income tax to pay oil companies.  Moral courage means standing up for the truth.

3010 2018-01-16 17:32:12 Thank god for oil
3011 2018-01-16 17:32:10 Yeah right. All thanks to the crude oil price, I&E window. There might be slowdown when the 2019 politicking starts. Massive sell down due to uncertainty.
3012 2018-01-16 17:32:07 What's the most useful piece of information I've gained from my 24 years of life? Don't cook oil without pants, can't believe I have to say that.
3013 2018-01-16 17:32:03 This Ladies Car Almost Just Caught On Fire She Was Putting Oil In While It Was Running 
3014 2018-01-16 17:32:02 No, because my primary care doctor is convinced that I don't have migraines. Ugh! I am going to try hemp oil. Supposed to be good. And yes, I get that too. Sometimes pain, sometimes not, but other weirdness. I'm in day 2 of the Migraine drain.

3018 2018-01-16 17:31:32 Ma warmed my car and checked my oil this morning  She’s literally a gift sent from above
3019 2018-01-16 17:31:28 She probably not aware of the oil money Norway got, and the high taxes all of the Nordics are dedicated to pay for welfare. And African people are working their behinds off from what I've seen while visiting several African countries.
3020 2018-01-16 17:31:25 @SpyV12 Yeesh! Have you taken care of the oil change?
3021 2018-01-16 17:31:22 I hope this oil change is fast but it probably won’t be.
3022 2018-01-16 17:31:21 Translation, enjoy the complements on selling out Wilderness to Big Oil.
Blue tidal wave coming
3023 2018-01-16 17:31:19 without oil Scotland still has a positive balance of trade. U'd tell us Dk is economically unviable
3024 2018-01-16 17:30:44 *drops off car for $30 oil change*

$300 later.......
3025 2018-01-16 17:30:36 The salmon oil I ordered for my pup came open during shipping. Thankfully they had the sense to package it in a ziploc bag, but now my sink and hands smell like fish from washing off the bottle

3029 2018-01-16 17:29:42 True! I love olive oil, but don’t think I’ve ever had an actual first pressing.
3030 2018-01-16 17:29:34 I think there is way more oil in the Atlantic margin than is believed. I want Scotland to get as much long term benefit from that as possible.
3031 2018-01-16 17:29:26 I bet those oil wells haven’t dried up yet  anyways I won’t want to see him at United just to block the way for young talents like Rashford, Martial and Linegard!!

3038 2018-01-16 17:28:29 It's kind of a bitch to do, but worth it... get natural beeswax, melt it down, mix with natural shea/coconut oil and voila homemade moisturizer. It does harden but once you scrape some and rub in your hands it's melts .
3039 2018-01-16 17:28:26 Thank you. The only improvement I can see from eliminating the argan oil is that it makes the conditioner cheaper for WF to produce, which quite frankly is just disappointing to a regular customer who has depended on the quality of the 365 products
3040 2018-01-16 17:28:21 Question: does that warm oil come with pepperoni? Because, absolutely.
3041 2018-01-16 17:28:20 Have you tried using an advocate oil found at the health food store? Works wonders on my skin

3044 2018-01-16 17:28:12 Cyber Currency as well as $USA, not backed by any commodity ( Gold, Oil, Land) are risky business. Yuan is getting stronger bc China is backing it with Gold. So be careful where you invest. Real Estate ( Houses, buildings & land) are still safe
3045 2018-01-16 17:28:10 Great job - BUT our crude oil export capability is severely strained because of the navigation depth of Texas Gulf Coast Ports - where 85-90% of US crude oil is exported.  Neither Port Arthur, Houston, or Corpus can accommodate New Panamax drafts.  Deepening needed asap!
3046 2018-01-16 17:28:09 I assumed you put some sort of oil in there for a pseudo-deep-fat-fry

Save that cooking oil. Works great as motor oil, hair gel, even lotion in a pinch.

3056 2018-01-16 17:26:59 Girl I had cystic acne on a day to day basis until I gave up dairy. Also you need to get UFO oil. Between those two things my skin is amazing now. The ufo oil has really helped with old scarring as well!
3057 2018-01-16 17:26:55 I read it as though tankies are snake oil salesmen who get people to work in sweatshops or send them to gulag by claiming that communism is a near unreachable Fully Automated Luxury Communism that takes forever to build.
3058 2018-01-16 17:26:55 Might be worth looking at global oil prices. 2014 they were coming down. Indian prices were high coz of duties. Now it’s more linked to intl prices.
3059 2018-01-16 17:26:43 Having business ties to a Russian oligarch doesn’t make one a Russian oligarch.. just like having ties to Saudi oil men, doesn’t make one a Saudi oil man

3063 2018-01-16 17:26:11 Do you understand how much of the Atlantic belongs to Scotland? Do you understand that BP wanted to go into oil production in the Clyde in 1981 but Thatcher stopped them. How many people would have avoided unemployment if she had said yes? How many businesses would have survived?
3064 2018-01-16 17:26:08 Trump wants oil rig platforms  up and down the coasts of America, yet he gave a waver to Florida. Was it ia Maralogo?
3065 2018-01-16 17:26:06 i see 5 clear waves down on oil, might not be quite finished yet, but some correcting then more down, short looking good so far
3066 2018-01-16 17:26:04 And one bottle of cooking oil and 1 bag of flour per month. The bernie sanders country.

3070 2018-01-16 17:25:54 Boars Head for the meat and cheese, mayo with olive oil and you mix that with a couple squirts of siracha. only improvement I can think of is walnut wheat bread, but doesn't make or break the experience.

3073 2018-01-16 17:25:10 Yup. Just give me some more oil on the side.
3074 2018-01-16 17:25:07 You’re right, there is corruption in govt in 3rd world countries / former colonies. There’s corruption in every govt everywhere in every system. I’m not sure what investments you mean, not sure how a multinational diamond, coffee, or oil company is ‘investing’, it’s profiteering
3075 2018-01-16 17:25:06 If one considers cryptos a "commodity", doesn't history suggest it would revisit its cost of production at some point? It ain't $12k

OIL COPPER GOLD SILVER LUMBAR.......
3076 2018-01-16 17:24:42 Wow thank you! *drinks the oil* MMMMM IT'S DELICIOUS OMG I LOVE IT
3077 2018-01-16 17:24:42 I've found that most bills that propose repealing an existing law are usually worthy of support.  Especially ridiculous old laws like this that are broken hundreds of times a day by citizens & municipalities as well. (our town uses plastic milk containers for recycled oil 2 burn)
3078 2018-01-16 17:24:35 I’ve been anointing myself with Thieves Oil for the past few days hoping to avoid Austin’s Snotfest. Yes. That’s a thing. #snotfest
3079 2018-01-16 17:24:35 This is fraudulent opening more for oil when we should be cutting back. We will fall behind other nations for Foreign Corporations TOP investors.
3080 2018-01-16 17:24:35 Know it’s not “cool” now but neck oil on tap would be lovely.
3081 2018-01-16 17:24:34 Then I'm right they will use up all our coal and oil. It's not humane for them to take our resources.
3082 2018-01-16 17:24:33 His hair looks like a full lint trap got dunked in canola oil.
3083 2018-01-16 17:24:26 And stop getting upset it’s only oil
3084 2018-01-16 17:24:10 Should pour some coconut oil in my moisturizer
3085 2018-01-16 17:23:55 Surely it is delusional to let a party that has not had a majority in Scotland since 1955 sell off oil to oil companies who the donate to that party to help it keep ruling Scotland even when it had no Scottish MPs.
3086 2018-01-16 17:23:42 Wonderful! Hellfire Oil! Thank you for your hard work. Here is your reward. Put it to good use.
3087 2018-01-16 17:23:33 I made a secret between you thing Virgin olive oil comes from???

3094 2018-01-16 17:22:34 Can I have some oil, please?
3095 2018-01-16 17:22:31 @vasseurbeauty just finished your latest video & it was so satisfying please do another but this isn't hate/me trying to come at you but I think you should look into Palm Oil and why it's such a problem only bc you used A ton of Oreos/m&ms which contain Palm oil. I love u tho:)
3096 2018-01-16 17:22:17 i need a mf essential oil diffuser
3097 2018-01-16 17:22:15 Nobody took that old bumper sticker seriously... “Please God, let there be another oil boom and I promise to not piss it all away again”.
3098 2018-01-16 17:22:12 Ice block and palm oil
3099 2018-01-16 17:21:45 Expect a post soon. Haha. But, in essence, vinegar, teatree oil, bicarb and I need for very little else!
3100 2018-01-16 17:21:35 Well, First the earth cooled. And then the dinosaurs came, but they got too big and fat, so they all died and they turned into oil. And then the Arabs came and they bought Mercedes Benzes. And Prince Charles started wearing all of Lady Di's clothes. I couldn't believe it.

3102 2018-01-16 17:21:24 Trump is George W on steroids: MASSIVE tax cuts for the TOP, loopholes for the TOP, deregulation, war mongering for natural resources & the exportation of U.S. Soldiers to protect PRIVATE Corp Oil. BTW: Obama's deficit includes George W's banking & auto industry CLEAN UP.
3103 2018-01-16 17:20:56 Exactly. No one wants three spoonfuls of COLD oil. Warm oil is just the thing  :D
3104 2018-01-16 17:20:53 Yes meanwhile back in Canada our stupid PM slaps on a carbon tax to kill our dieing oil industry. Wtf is wrong with our government . we need to stimulate growth here before we end up in a major recession.

3106 2018-01-16 17:20:40 Hmm, let’s think, a choice between warm oil and pizza....
3107 2018-01-16 17:20:39 It's gon' hurt my soul just to reminisce
3108 2018-01-16 17:20:36 Japan wants our oil. Looks likely that Japan will seize our oil sources in the Dutch East Indies #downwiththeaxis
3109 2018-01-16 17:20:36 Shale production is set to push U.S. oil output to record-breaking high Philip Roth how oil surged…
3110 2018-01-16 17:20:26 Rosehip seed oil is not being good to my face...such a pity because it has great reviews. Ah well, I guess Argan and Jojoba are my skin plugs
3111 2018-01-16 17:20:08 GOOD FATS: Avocado, Fish, Almonds, Walnuts, Peanuts, Cashews, Olive Oil, Coconut Oil, Seeds, Coconut, Olives, Peanut Butter, Low-Fat Dairy
3112 2018-01-16 17:20:04 Obummer was the biggest con artist and do nothing President in the history of the United States. The guy could talk and that's it. He's a lawyer and he still didn't handle the BP gulf oil spill very well. He gave $150 billion to Iran, in cash. What did he actually do? Tell me.
3113 2018-01-16 17:19:57 I really hate when lazy females ask me to oil their scalp  like....you have 2 hands with all 10 fingers. Why can't you oil your own? You see me. I base my own scalp. Now I must be touching your dandruff. Smh, this is why I used to charge girls when we were in high school 
3114 2018-01-16 17:19:51 I think it was referenced by either of Achebe or Forsyth, not entirely sure though. 

Finished Oil, Politics and Violence last November, randomly stumbled upon it at a motor park. It was very educative too... 

Is there any other one?
3115 2018-01-16 17:19:49 Isn't it amazing how getting an oil change, after you've ignored it and thought your car was going to blow up, makes you feel like a true adult. #Responsible
3116 2018-01-16 17:19:36 This should have been the argument when UPA couldn’t reduce petroleum prices when oil touched 150$. But that time though prices were not as high as they are today we ensured that UPA pays price for it. Why adjust today n feel happy about it? No we are not happy
3117 2018-01-16 17:19:34 I left my  oil on the wrong day
3118 2018-01-16 17:19:23 Father I pray in the name of Jesus that you send the same angel that ministered the healing oil to me to Kristeen and that she is anointed with healing oil, the balm of Gilead, and that she is covered by the power of the blood of Jesus.

3121 2018-01-16 17:19:15 Just remember to be changing oil and topping up fuel regularly. 
Also make sure you wash your Bajaj motorcycle regularly and polish the seats.
3122 2018-01-16 17:19:09 Now they’ve got me jonesin’ for some warm oil.
3123 2018-01-16 17:18:44 Now, there are many clues that China & Russia are busy adding a "2nd arbiter of value" to this thru oil markets; that's likely why Gold/Oil ratio went from 13x to 48x in 18 mths fr Sep-14 thur early-16.  IMO this is why CNY oil contract could be so important: 2nd arbiter of value
3124 2018-01-16 17:18:29 Over all too much oil isn't good for you. Just use less of things except vegetables. What I noticed is that in America we got focused on finding a solution to issues and as soon as there is close to a solution we consume it like it the last thing on Earth. Advertisements=$
3125 2018-01-16 17:18:28 DAX +0.4%, S&P +0.3%.  Kuka +8%, Merck +7%, BlackBerry & Equinix +4%, while Mosiac & JC Penney -4%, UnderArmour -8%.  Oil -1%, but Bitcoin -14%, down to 11,694. (Cue implosion?)
3126 2018-01-16 17:18:21 True. I just want to be on the right side of a fractal cycle.
3127 2018-01-16 17:18:17 slice it so it's in strips, chop up an onion so it's also in long pieces, get a pan with some oil in it, and cook it with some coarse salt.
3128 2018-01-16 17:18:03 Wow why is everyone like this? It’s literally just blended chickpeas and some oil
3129 2018-01-16 17:18:02 Today's soap is a special order. Shea Butter, Vitamin E Oil, Jojoba oil and eucalyptus essential oil for Jaimie Rachelle
3130 2018-01-16 17:18:01 I need to stop playing games and get an oil change on Carlitó and stop playing in this winter cold.
3131 2018-01-16 17:17:56 I don't know if I can do three spoons of oil.  Lemme see if I can flavor it with some bread and cheese and tomato.
3132 2018-01-16 17:17:55 If you have the time...take a moment and oil your wife down after her showers. Fr lol as often as time permits 
3133 2018-01-16 17:17:53 @cvpayne I’m just a click away from starting my Stash account. Problem is I don’t know where to begin. I like gold/silver and oil.
3134 2018-01-16 17:17:52 Both? Dry and oily aren't opposites. The hydration and oil levels are usually conflated, which is one of the major problems with the Western industry.
3135 2018-01-16 17:17:46 The robe the angel wore was mostly red and signifying the blood of Jesus. The angel anointed me with the healing oil by the power of the blood of Jesus. I was healed and delivered.
3136 2018-01-16 17:17:21 Pastense oil from Doterra! It’s a lifesaver for me
3137 2018-01-16 17:17:06 We had Unions full intelligent officers qualified, Law Now the Russians have all the gas China has its own oil gas coal We have fracking! nuclear chemistry One man running a set of dials Low efficiency energy transfers massive distances Can you run HS2 on S.

3139 2018-01-16 17:16:43 I asked for an oil change for a birthday present, when did I grow up? 
3140 2018-01-16 17:16:34 Castor oil is saving my eyebrows.
3141 2018-01-16 17:16:24 The Koch brothers bought a piece of the puppet, in part to pull its strings on allowing for the pipeline. The Koch brothers own over 1.1 million acres in the Alberta oil sands.  Worse than coal in pollution from extraction process.
3142 2018-01-16 17:16:02 Not interested Tusk, go sell your snake oil somewhere else.
3143 2018-01-16 17:16:02 coconut oil smells like coconut ;o
3144 2018-01-16 17:15:50 Trump's all about the money. He lies about the sex stuff. Again 19% of 500billion dollar oil deal from Exxon & Russia. Drilling in the artic off shore drilling east & west coast national parks drilling & mining. He's raping America & the planet
3145 2018-01-16 17:15:22 As a govt well wisher, to help stabile fuel prices it should introduce a fuel escalator; when the international crude oil price increases, tax should be reduced and vice versa. This will protect the average person from the fluctuations of oil prices and not increase deficit.
3146 2018-01-16 17:15:06 They have   transferred of oil price to his bissnus man friends thats ok
3147 2018-01-16 17:15:04 Crude Oil prints fresh session low at 63.44. #forex #CRUDEOIL

3150 2018-01-16 17:14:43 J dropped a bottle of olive oil out of the cupboard above. Last night was unpleasant, to say the least.
3151 2018-01-16 17:14:39 I had a friend that cooked jollof by putting the oil, tomatoes, onions, spices and everything together with the rice so it all cooks together.
Her point was, it's all gonna cook together at the end so why make stew first and then add rice after. Just add all. Hm
3152 2018-01-16 17:14:39 @SnarfHappens my bf and I love your sandwiches. Just wish you had better options for salads! I am on strict diet until next month, and was disappointed that Austin didn't have olive oil, and only had canola oil, and didn't have any dressing options that wasn't added with sugar.
3153 2018-01-16 17:14:39 RT I do have another question..you/"Orsted" were DONG ENERGY/oil,natural gas/then DONG onshore wind/then DONG Offshore wind/NOW in U.S. as OrstedNA+Bay State Wind ..THE QUESTION HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT THIS IS THE 21ST CENTURY AND IT IS TIME TO GO NUCLEAR which is the future?
3154 2018-01-16 17:14:34 There is not enough coconut oil and moisturizer in the world to help my skin this winter.
3155 2018-01-16 17:14:26 Just had another offshore oil spill. We don’t need more. Alternative energy is much safer.
3156 2018-01-16 17:14:18 When fixing my hair this morning, I squeezed the last bit of Argan oil out of the tube and rather than it going into my hand it ended up in my mouth. #MondayMorning #MondayBlogs #awkward
3157 2018-01-16 17:14:14 doesn't whey protein have BCAA? and other proteins aswell. isn't that enough? Only supplement I'm really doing right now is fish oil.
3158 2018-01-16 17:14:11 And yet you plan on lessening the amount of time to apply for land use permits and meeting with oil & gas corporations regarding those land use permits. 

All in the same week.  Coincidence? Nope.

You are NOT fooling anyone.
3159 2018-01-16 17:13:40 7-8 years ago when I was in the hospital I thought I was going insane and an angel of the Lord anointed me with healing oil, and the Lord said "Start putting it all back together." My mind was fine.
3160 2018-01-16 17:13:36 Don’t forget the gas crisis. Jimmy Carter said we were running out of oil
3161 2018-01-16 17:13:35 Vodka is better when it's so cold it pours like oil.
3162 2018-01-16 17:13:30 if either party discovers the island is over a rich seam of oil there will be a very sudden change in their relationship status.

3168 2018-01-16 17:12:47 Carrier oil + circulatory system = sudden death.
So you definitely can.
3169 2018-01-16 17:12:47 Now that the healthfulness of coconut oil has been debunked, how do you feel about avocado oil?  What is the healthiest of the plant based oils?
3170 2018-01-16 17:12:47 1700 tons of Manuka honey is produced in New Zealand BUT 10000 tons is sold worldwide, how do they do it, it's as magic as the snake oil benefits of Manuka honey.
Hmm John has his doubts about Holland and Barretts 1 cent Manuka honey sale. (Thou if it is fake, it tis lovely)
3171 2018-01-16 17:12:44 And without palm oil. You can see why I had to buy them.
3172 2018-01-16 17:12:29 What kind of oil and how warm? There so much information missing here! But I also lean toward yup!

3175 2018-01-16 17:12:16 Yep Joe, you keep on banging that drum and tell Albertans how wonderful the future looks. In the mean time more restaurants are shutting their doors. And the 360k people that were working direct & indirectly in oil and gas are the majority still unemployed. U R One term wonders.
3176 2018-01-16 17:12:15 $ENRJ oil is up, this company is merging soon too! Fire sale at this price guys!
3177 2018-01-16 17:12:12 We should respect the the snake oil salesman who wants to give us war crimes!

3184 2018-01-16 17:11:28 May be.  Oil seems tired too
3185 2018-01-16 17:11:26 I like Shea oil with 2 drops each of lavender, lemon, and tea tree
3186 2018-01-16 17:11:25 Big oil is so shook by NY's divestment announcement that they got a letter to the editor in the Albany Times-Union this past weekend. Good.

Lets face the facts. Norway is subsidised by selling a lot of oil. Otherwise they wouldn’t be so lucky.

3212 2018-01-16 17:08:34 Yes. Good and encouraging, but it's mostly symbolic. Full speed ahead for oil & gas in other areas. Still, LoVeSe can perhaps serve as inspiration for keeping up the fight.

3336 2018-01-16 16:58:42 Then why are there constantly oil spills that destroy our beautiful coasts & kill wildlife? Limit #OffshoreDrilling!
3337 2018-01-16 16:58:39 @Kevin_Dolley bring the GoPro tomorrow boet!! Also, oil thise pistons!!
3338 2018-01-16 16:58:33 Thanks, that makes sense. Especially in CO, right? I’m torn myself. Oil interests are real & valid, feeding a lot of families. I’m never sure we’re not profoundly fracking up our environment though. (Cheesy pun fully intended)
3339 2018-01-16 16:58:33 I can't eat hot wings without feeling nauseous afterwads. How do you guys eat them everyday??? All that oil 
3340 2018-01-16 16:58:22 Try frankincense! It’s an antibacterial and anti-inflammatory essential oil.
3341 2018-01-16 16:58:19 I also got my warmblood very underweight, it took a year of grain, hay, weight gainers, oil, etc... just to get him to where people weren’t asking me if he was ok lol. I feel your pain.
3342 2018-01-16 16:57:55 All of the major and independent oil & gas producers seem to be configuring their systems to invite an attack.
3343 2018-01-16 16:57:41 It’s so cold and I needs go get my oil changed 
3344 2018-01-16 16:57:28 My favorite scientific blunder of my lifetime was how we were going to completely run out of oil. As recently as ‘07 they said we would tap out production by 2011 
3345 2018-01-16 16:57:26 In spite of the efforts of the left and Obama to squash U.S. Oil production.
3346 2018-01-16 16:57:23 I would love to start the CBD oil but I won’t until Indiana makes a definitive decision to make it legal. For me it’s psychological. If I start and have to stop, it would make the pain worse because I would have had relief that was taken away. In my head, that makes sense
3347 2018-01-16 16:57:13 Gotta get my oil changed for my car today but I dont feel like it
3348 2018-01-16 16:57:11 Ну как обычно
Ничего удивительного
3349 2018-01-16 16:56:59 Okay, no, if I’m disassembling my engine this far for a timing chain then I may as well drain the oil too and replace the head gasket but then I gotta change all the seals and bolts and that’s another $200 , I guess I have to get this IKEA job then
3350 2018-01-16 16:56:43 I read the first 5 letters and thought u were coming for us and my fight or flight was activated

3353 2018-01-16 16:56:06 นั่งคิดเรื่องชีวิตหลังเรียนจบมันก็เศร้าชิบหาย เฮ้ออออออออออออออออออออ
อนาคตมืดมัวไปหมด TT
3354 2018-01-16 16:56:03 do you have similar chart for crude oil?
3355 2018-01-16 16:55:46 and yes I'm complaining about regular shit like oil changes lmao
3356 2018-01-16 16:55:40 Now Playing: Oil - When No One Cares
3357 2018-01-16 16:55:38 Mine has unlimited hay, 8 pounds of grain a day, oil, and honestly looks like he’s dying... but I bought him 450 pounds underweight in October so that he’s put on any weight over winter is a miracle in my books!!
3358 2018-01-16 16:55:37 I feel ya there, brother. One thing that's really helped me lately is lavender. I put on lavender oil before bed and it's known to calm the central nervous system. I give it to my little brother with insomnia. You can pick up a roll on on Amazon, or elsewhere. Hope this helps. 
3359 2018-01-16 16:55:36 To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that he might be glorified. Isaiah 61:3 #KJV
3360 2018-01-16 16:55:35 Oil about to rally. Shaking people out
3361 2018-01-16 16:55:20 NYC sues oil and gas companies for climate change. When it gets thrown out for lack of evidence, will they finally simmer down?
#climatechangehoax #climatechange #fakenews
3362 2018-01-16 16:55:12 The Banksters probably like this fact. They can more easily drive companies into bankruptcy by lowering the borrowing base when/if oil & nat. gas prices fall.
3363 2018-01-16 16:54:54 I’m Really Pushing It  I Need To Get My Oil Changed Like YESTERDAY 
3364 2018-01-16 16:54:42 again, thank you! I so enjoyed researching the peak oil books and blogs out there.

3366 2018-01-16 16:54:24 Motor oil is motor oil.
3367 2018-01-16 16:54:19 The cycle for the most part ends on the appearance of the next Big Dark Blue UP Arrow or Big White UP Arrow and FE is at the extreme. e.g Above 95 positive or below 95 negative is extreme. Note COT long leveraging is currently at the extreme too..
3368 2018-01-16 16:54:18 - Coconut Oil Shea Butter Olive Oil & Black Soap moving forward 
3369 2018-01-16 16:54:13 The fix is simple – apply a  hair oil,  such as sarson (mustard oil) and badaam (almond oil) or soak  hair with  non-chlorinated water before swimming.
3370 2018-01-16 16:54:07 Yam & palm oil
3371 2018-01-16 16:54:06 @benshapiro start a #GoFundMe for her and anyone else that faces this despicable forced silence. Sure there are tons of people who would love to help!
3372 2018-01-16 16:54:04 Using your oil argument, how will you determine which winds are Scottish winds that will drive Scottish wind turbines, or will you sell some wind to rUK to enable their turbines to turn? Plenty to spare in Holyrood!
3373 2018-01-16 16:53:58 I think you’ll go crazy trying to time every move, I think that shorting now and waiting is the best strategy and maybe go long if we break the fractal high to hedge?
3374 2018-01-16 16:53:43 I’m in enough pain it is making me nauseous, my blood sugar is low because I can’t eat, food helps my MJ oil work better, I can’t take the oil if I’m nauseous, the nausea won’t go away if I’m in pain, the oil is what fixes the pain.

I want to cry but I’m too tired and sore.
3375 2018-01-16 16:53:39 I'm considering any fork that anyone can advertise on some random website and name/brand drop some wallets or whatever with mystery devs, gets ppl walking in with there with money as long as it's listed somewhere. There's modern day snake oil salemens too.
3376 2018-01-16 16:53:32 for deep conditioners, the shea moisture black castor oil one is good and the multivitamin one from them is amazinggggg

3387 2018-01-16 16:52:14 Got to wonder if Kirstjen Nielsen knows anything about #Norway? Norway has womb to tomb socialism, 5 weeks paid vacation, free university & oil corps must give large share of profits to pay for social welfare programs. IE high taxes & socialism = "people work hard" @SecNielsen?
3388 2018-01-16 16:52:10 Our livelihood depends on oil thats what my hubby does personally I'd go live in a shack with solar oh and the best part is give or take 30 minutes from wolfcamp shale is a ginormous wind farm
3389 2018-01-16 16:52:05 At the time, oil was life. Let’s stop this. It is becoming too obvious.
3390 2018-01-16 16:52:05 I like how you talk about deregulation as a good things that help us but if you could read you would see why they were put in place...bank fraud, oil spills, toxic water...
3391 2018-01-16 16:52:00 Let’s recall most “luggage” fees were put in place during the oil surge a dec ago to comp for losses and were never repealed when oil fell
3392 2018-01-16 16:51:18 Only got worse after jekyll island and Nixon unhooking us from gold. If they unhook it from oil, we're doomed. Weimar republic here we come!
3393 2018-01-16 16:51:13 i need got go get my oil changed but also i’d like to just stay in bed
3394 2018-01-16 16:51:00 When oil gets dry. Modi will bring back kabaa, alaqsa, al masjid and show who ALLA is

3397 2018-01-16 16:50:49 TUESDAY MORNING IN ENERGY, after the MLK holiday, and boy hey there's a lot of (energy) news: a slew of new oil price forecasts, crude production marching to a record, Hess layoffs, and the spill in the S China Sea gets worse: 

Let's do this.

3398 2018-01-16 16:50:42 @JennaJulien Snake Oil 2 is one of the best podcasts I've watched so far, haven't stopped laughing 
3399 2018-01-16 16:50:29 Trump is going to use that wall money the same way Russian oligarchs use RU oil money. It will find a way to his pocket.
3400 2018-01-16 16:50:28 Dump that oil on the pizza and let's go.
3401 2018-01-16 16:50:09 Snake oil salesman MP, this is a piece of political journalism full of journalistic masterbation. It is a red meat for opposition supporters. Not meant for the reflection of any serious MP. Sell something else. There is so much to sell these days.
3402 2018-01-16 16:50:09 I like using just plain old coconut oil or this Burt’s beez chapstick i have! They seem to work good for me
3403 2018-01-16 16:49:56 @PMOIndia @narendramodi  if govt has a plan to make 100% vehicles electrical by 2030 then why govt is investing 47000cr. Rupees in Badmer oil refinery if oil will be less used then these refineries have very less or no benifit to nation.
3404 2018-01-16 16:49:30 He's reaching Randy Orton's level of baby oil usage.
3405 2018-01-16 16:49:25 Ok oja. Nk refer kt mmber keje oil n gas.
3406 2018-01-16 16:49:19 Or was it oil??
3407 2018-01-16 16:49:15 Graham is under the delusion he could someday be @POTUS he tried it before and failed, now he going to try it as a moderate. Just watch the snake oil salesman.
3408 2018-01-16 16:49:07 @narendramodi sir how does the gov justly the extreme rise in oil prices over the years it has come into power? Why is oil STILL NOT UNDER GST?
3409 2018-01-16 16:49:01 oh!イル
3410 2018-01-16 16:48:59 Coconut  oil is amazing
3411 2018-01-16 16:48:54 Whatever was the rest of Canada doing without an oil boom? How only AB brought all Canadians out of an economic dark age...

3420 2018-01-16 16:47:54 @rhum01 you would lose this argument real quick if you want to examine what true values are. Remember, I’ve seen it up close working for the predatory oil companies in third world countries that take advantage of people! Don’t even go there...I lost a lot of work speaking up
3421 2018-01-16 16:47:50 unfortunately the "reward" is playing the number 1 seed next match....
3422 2018-01-16 16:47:34 Why Saudi Aramco, the world's largest oil company, is trying to make vehicle engines more efficient #Forex
3423 2018-01-16 16:47:27 Does that mean I just ate 3 teaspoons of cold oil?
3424 2018-01-16 16:47:25 When you’ll see the oil price in ten years you’ll reconsider this ;)
3425 2018-01-16 16:47:22 Why am I so pretentious about olive oil? I wont get it if it's not in a glass bottle. Silly thing really.
3426 2018-01-16 16:47:21 On behalf of entire @Hindustan_Zinc family, please accept our heartiest congratulations & best wishes for setting up a state of the art oil refinery in Rajasthan. This is a tremendous landmark and indeed a new dawn, not just for the State, but also for country in oil sufficiency.
3427 2018-01-16 16:47:09 You Are reporting lies for your own agenda. Sarah Sanders is just telling the truth. We all know the truth is a concept MSM can't seem to grasp
3428 2018-01-16 16:47:08 If you want your hair to grow at rapid speed, blend: Mayonnaise, eggs, honey, olive oil, coconut oil, Jamaican Castor oil, avocados, annndd vitamin e oil.. blend it all together until it’s like a real watery substance. Section your hair into four sections.
3429 2018-01-16 16:47:03 Made in America :) "... surging shale production is poised to push U.S. oil output to more than 10 million barrels per day - toppling a record set in 1970 and crossing a threshold few could have imagined even a decade ago ..." That's MAGA to me :)
3430 2018-01-16 16:46:48 Always worried about how that “deal” will screw Americans. Do we give up our national parks to big oil? Allow more pollution in our water ways? Kill the laws that define “organic”? We pay for a wall? More tax break 4 Donald and friends?

3436 2018-01-16 16:46:13 I came Sunday to get my oil changed but I left after
3437 2018-01-16 16:46:06 The Rising oil price will probably have more of an effect on inflation if it continues
3438 2018-01-16 16:46:06 Saved 60.05$ on my oil change ayyyyee
3439 2018-01-16 16:45:54 Meal oil spread sharp move from two week low to two week high in 2 days trade. NOPA at 11.
3440 2018-01-16 16:45:51 Why don't you ask government to reduce taxes on crude oil
3441 2018-01-16 16:45:46 Cover oil consistency, server maintenance, and "how to" videos on keeping their steel shiny. They'll spare you for sure after that.
3442 2018-01-16 16:45:42 Need gas. Need oil change. Need brakes done. Need one of my men to take care of it all. 
3443 2018-01-16 16:45:37 Meh, I called for HY energy implosion starting in 2014 and yet didn’t successfully monetize. Being early often = being wrong. Offshore market was rolling over at $100+, if thesis is oil higher given shake undersupply bs expectation, better places than offshore rigs imo
3444 2018-01-16 16:45:30 Donald Trump is an idiot. Dont invest too much into that. He’s already full discredited himself. He’s a con man, a snake oil salesmen, a used car salesmen w a unhealthy obsession w tacky gold lamè tapestries, prob hoping to cover his 7 or so failed bankruptcies & mountain of debt
3445 2018-01-16 16:45:24 I cry every day. Families are being ripped apart by America's Hitler-In-Chief!!! He takes his fat a** on to the golf course every other damn day while spewing his oil venom on America!!! This cannot go on; it is wrong! His election into the presidency was DIRTY & he MUST Go!!!
3446 2018-01-16 16:45:23 Soup : tomato basil / / special : white bean stew with braised pork, collard greens, carrots, toasted bread and olive oil

3448 2018-01-16 16:45:13 ねるのよ
3449 2018-01-16 16:45:10 I used 200gr soya milk, 450gr vegetable oil, 2 tbs of mustard, some apple vinegar and some lemon juice. You mix all the ingredients together (you pour the oil at three different times tho). The recipe concluded some agave syrup too but I didn't have any. You Keep it in the fridge
3450 2018-01-16 16:44:45 Big Government is a like an Oil Tanker, only way to stop it or change direction is Sink it, or give it 4 years' notice to change. 
3451 2018-01-16 16:44:35 But these oil developers are international corporations who bring in their own for the high paying jobs. And there aren't thousands in any one area being hired. I too think locals should decide what they want to do and don't like this national political decision made in DC.
3452 2018-01-16 16:44:30 2500 and it lasts for up to 2 months. High end luxury beard oil, second to none. And has an awesome scent.
3453 2018-01-16 16:44:05 I eat dat shit every morning !!! Fish oil too
3454 2018-01-16 16:44:01 Y crees tú que Trump va a ir y salir gratis? Se les lleva el petróleo. “Let’s take the oil” es una de sus frases favoritas
3455 2018-01-16 16:44:00 #Chevron will resume oil and gas drilling operations at the Sarta 3 block in #Iraqi #Kurdistan “in the near future”
3456 2018-01-16 16:43:48 Ororo no be crude oil..
3457 2018-01-16 16:43:47 If it's international waters, and those ships are smuggling something (drugs, ivory, oil, people) - then no, it isn't an act of war.

An act of war would be firing on ships without cause that are in their own country's harbor. #PearlHarbor

3459 2018-01-16 16:43:40 So playing Devil's Advocate, the oil tanker refused to go to port for inspection and suffered consequences?  Don't ya hate it when I think aloud? LOL
3460 2018-01-16 16:43:28 bagsak nga ako nung highschool sa modulo art kasi oil pastel ang medium bwisit
3461 2018-01-16 16:43:26 I like cooling, and I read a lot about it, and as a result I read a lot of dumb mistruths. So basically what I'm getting at is that canola oil is completely safe within reasonable limits
3462 2018-01-16 16:43:24 Saving is a bit over the top here when Paul voted against a reasonable measure to constrain oil and gas. When he’s consistently voting for the environment; then that will be the time for praise.
3463 2018-01-16 16:43:19 Get the pepperoni cooked right and there will be lil oil cups with every bite.
3464 2018-01-16 16:43:13 How is it the Dems will shut down the government when the Republicans control the house, Senate, and the white house???  More smoke and mirrors from a snake oil salesmen
3465 2018-01-16 16:43:00 It's not Monday morning QB. It's realizing that the Bush administration made up those facts to push us to invade a country that was trying to stop selling their oil in US dollars. Smart people change their minds when they see new evidence....
3466 2018-01-16 16:42:51 That is because they have no Oil.
3467 2018-01-16 16:42:50 If you want to find natural products for your skin and hair really cheap e.g. rose water, aloe Vera, African black soap coconut oil, black castor oil - Asain/black hair shops are the plug
3468 2018-01-16 16:42:37 @Varneyco #gasprices please somebody explain why with oil production up big time-gasoline cost is rocketing? Some of us out here can’t afford $3/4 Gallon. These Reps (Demos) pounding about “inappropriate language”....Give me a break!!!

3471 2018-01-16 16:42:10 Like Americans have a "Choice" of fuels where they live..!!
Who wants to have an old 'Oil' eating furnace, wherein 40 years ago, Paraffin was added to the oils to give them 50,000 BTU per gallon, now 14,000 BTU from concessions of components.. 
Pay more/get less..!!
3472 2018-01-16 16:42:08 When adding 3/4 a cup of oil to a recipe instead of 1/3 you know I'm really sick. #nothealthy #literally
3473 2018-01-16 16:42:08 Just ordered @tastenirvana coconut water & coconut oil and feeling really adult bc I opted for self-care purchases over instant gratification material buys on @Amazon.
3474 2018-01-16 16:42:01 @MaralaScott May The Lord God make His Oil shine upon your face as He. Continue to establish you into the earth  #youmakeitfeellikechristmas For when A Word meets A Word it makes A Sentence unto Him In The Book Of Life. Amen  unto a paragraph #thisilove. Keep going!
3475 2018-01-16 16:41:52 North Dakota #oil production up 11,000 bpd in November vs October to 1,195,000 bpd - state regulator
3476 2018-01-16 16:41:52 เสียใจ เสียใจที่สุด ไม่น่าส่องเลย เขารักกันดี เราก็ควรจะยินด้วยด้วยสิ  พี่คงรู้สึกมากไป เพราะน้องเป็นผู้ชายในแบบที่พี่ชอบ เลยเสียใจหนักขนาดนี้
3477 2018-01-16 16:41:44 My joint say my oil at 24% I should be good for another week . Lol
3478 2018-01-16 16:41:23 and that's what you get for using my body oil!
3479 2018-01-16 16:41:09 Suraj + Randy say- Atlantic Mehaden don't just help make products like pet feed, fertilizer, oil, paints, soap, ink, cosmetics, and steel tempering products. They also filter many harmful things out of the water at a rate of 6 1/2 gallons of water every min!! #cleanwaterforlife
3480 2018-01-16 16:40:51 Are you just going through the whole GOLD Silver and OIL charts and telling everyone they are all going to double or triple? LOL WTF?
3481 2018-01-16 16:40:41 Us too! But mama puts wierd stuffs in like coconut oil & almond milk. She nuts! Why no tuna juice???
3482 2018-01-16 16:40:41 Yeah but what if we get another fractal cycle up after we get to like 60. How would we know to go long?
3483 2018-01-16 16:40:34 Iran and Saudi are about the same but Saudi sells their oil in US dollars so for some reason they are the "good guys".... keep up.
3484 2018-01-16 16:40:22 And, just to clarify. Norwegian oil wasn’t discovered until 1967. That’s 22 years after the last nazi-groups were banned by the Norwegian government. Just some facts for ya!
3485 2018-01-16 16:40:19 I could have sworn I remembered you recommending a specific sunscreen from Kiehl's in this tweet! @jourdanhafen and I are trying to figure out which one we need, do you have a rec? if you have a minute ^.^ I currently use oil of olay + spf bb cream.
3486 2018-01-16 16:40:15 Do: take fish oil for healthier skin and immune system, etc.
Don’t: take it in the morning

3488 2018-01-16 16:40:08 It’s Glasgow’s oil and whiskey, eh? Try telling that to people who work in o & g and whiskey. Set up you Nat republic in Glasgowshire and leave us out if it.
3489 2018-01-16 16:39:58 Just saw a groupon for gas?? Is @elonmusk taking it to the Oil Giants that hard or am I missing something?
3490 2018-01-16 16:39:45 How many of you have tried

Comment Below.
3491 2018-01-16 16:39:41 Today's indian govt working like a dictator govt because when he wants increase prices of oil then increases. And don't heard aam aadmi
3492 2018-01-16 16:39:38 My dad used to work for Rapid Oil way back and he said that the entire thing is a scam. They did this same thing to me last time I had my oil changed. Car is a 2013 and they tried upselling me a ton of shit that I didn't need. Just bought the car.
3493 2018-01-16 16:39:38 Critical question is that even though the crude oil went down to $40 a barrel we paid practically same amount per liter that we paid during UPA when prices were $100 a barrel.
3494 2018-01-16 16:39:34 "People pray for cake,then God gives them the batter,eggs,oil,icing,a pan,a oven,they get get frustrated and leave the kitchen".Let that sink.sometimes you have everything in front of you.but how bad do you want it ?
3495 2018-01-16 16:39:34 Maine’s lobster and shrimp business will be destroyed by oil drillers and or oil leaking offshore. I cant believe they won’t be next in line to protest.
3496 2018-01-16 16:39:33 That's funny since Norway has womb to tomb socialism, 5 weeks paid  vacation, free university & oil corps must give large share of profits to the gov to pay for social welfare programs. IE high taxes & socialism gets people to work hard @SecNielsen?
3497 2018-01-16 16:39:27 How art thou, thou globby bottle of cheap stinking chip oil?
3498 2018-01-16 16:39:01 I think it depends on your length of time. I think Jimboman is holding until 47, which is what I am targeting unless he says otherwise
3499 2018-01-16 16:38:55 New York Mayor Sues Oil Companies Over Bad Weather - CAN VOTERS SUE HIM FOR BEING
A JACKASS??
3500 2018-01-16 16:38:55 1) people need to get over this unilateral hate of oil/fat and 2) who the fuck cares, pizza is tasty. LET PEOPLE ENJOY THINGS, FOOD SHAMERS.
3501 2018-01-16 16:38:52 Too bad the drones can't see all the millions of gallons of oil that you guys dispersed to the ocean floor ... Way to bullshit the world!
3502 2018-01-16 16:38:50 Fred Flintstone style?

I had a 75 Ford. In the end I didn't even change oil, just waited until the oil light came on the fill it out of the 4 litre jug of 30 W that I carried.
In retrospect I wish I had kept that truck. The body was good and they are a sharp project.
3503 2018-01-16 16:38:46 Also US shale is expected to pass Saudi Arabia and Russia as largest producer of oil in the world later this year . OPEC has lost its iron fist and is no longer feared !!!
3504 2018-01-16 16:38:42 OIL DIFF: 5.58 -> 5.61
3505 2018-01-16 16:38:27 Just microwave the oil
3506 2018-01-16 16:38:17 Just barely made yesterday for the Church one lol. Which I’m giddy about cause Monet is cool, but those oil studies on cardboard & paint by numbers looking references sketches in the Church exhibit were fascinating.
3507 2018-01-16 16:38:11 $SKPO put this oil ticker on your watchlist one of the best out there
3508 2018-01-16 16:38:09 For those who saw the viral photoset about the effects of cheap lip stains on facebook. Lipstains are literally just oil and dye, that's why it's cheap. These can dry your lips faster than the usual lip product. Esp. if you did not exfoliate/balm your lips beforehand.
3509 2018-01-16 16:37:45 luh di ako marunong sa oil pastel
3510 2018-01-16 16:37:24 Sir we have burned midnight oil to get through the rigorous selection procedure of  jkpsc.For the first time in the history of jkpsc weightage was given to the written test and we have proven our mettle.sir plz issue the formal order regarding our full salary
3511 2018-01-16 16:37:21 All that said, I don't think I'd hold Norway up as a model for anything relating to hard work, even if those in the oil industry do - when they aren't drunk.
3512 2018-01-16 16:37:17 Cari review sek kiyo sing masalahe sama. Eh punya e the body shop tea tree oil serum or something iku cobak my fren pake itu dan cocok.. beli sing size paling cilik dulu nek gak cocok jualen lagi
3513 2018-01-16 16:37:10 I knew when he didn't go to Louisiana when the BP oil spill happened- it spewed for THREE MONTHS... and only after THREE MONTHS, did he deign to go see the damage . I knew then he was an arrogant aloof Narcissist.
3514 2018-01-16 16:36:59 Cuba didn't help NATO bomb Libya to kingdom come, for starters, nor did it organize an oil boycott against Venezuela
3515 2018-01-16 16:36:26 @TomHutcheon2 or drink oil while eating pizza
3516 2018-01-16 16:36:18 Fed by AB Conservatives, too, to hide the fact that the oil industry does not have Alberta's best interests in mind, just those of management and shareholders.
3517 2018-01-16 16:36:06 Your brain needs oil.
3518 2018-01-16 16:35:59 ଧର୍ମେନ୍ଦ୍ର ଭାଇ june 2008 ରେ crude oil 136.31 dollar ଥିଲା । ସେତେବେଳେ ଭାରତ ରେ ପେଟ୍ରୋଲ ଦର କେତେ ଥିଲା ।@dpradhanbjp
3519 2018-01-16 16:35:55 wait till they find oil under there...
3520 2018-01-16 16:35:48 The major part of the Norwegian society hates the newly established nazi-groupings. There hasn’t been nazi-groups in Norway since the 1940s. Doesn’t really have anything to do with oil, rather that the establishment of the groups spiked after Trumps election.
3521 2018-01-16 16:35:38 And I’ve always wanted to tell u that u inspired me to go to the southern coast during the oil spill and volunteer in the clean up. Spent 4 very fulfilling weeks making a difference. It was worth every min. A thank u “Kirstie” from the heart.
3522 2018-01-16 16:35:28 I’m the same and I’m almost 30 my skin hasn’t been clear since September and it’s really getting me down, even tea tree oil doesn’t help

3524 2018-01-16 16:35:14 There's no greater way to make money than to grow it yourself.
So if he can hype a coin, sell it, then let it collapse just to hype and sell it again... sounds like an oil rig under his twitter fingers.
3525 2018-01-16 16:35:01 Bought castor oil from mercury drug and applied it on my brows and lashes just now. Let's see if this will work. Good night folks!
3526 2018-01-16 16:34:58 You mean little light blue down? The explanation to that is in the notebook. My question is how do we know when to end a position? Say at like 60.50 this cycle ends, and a long cycle begins. Which arrow indicates that it's best to end the short? How will we know?
3527 2018-01-16 16:34:57 Maybe the oil pressure is related to your air bag problem
3528 2018-01-16 16:34:54 The govt is charging import duty on crude oil , then taxes on finished product the fuel is supplied by government with no competition worth talking about,  the subsidy on various fuel product s is gone now the govt making even more  money #fuelpricepain
3529 2018-01-16 16:34:49 Ima be responsible and go get an oil change on my lunch break
3530 2018-01-16 16:34:46 All set to release the Deloitte report on KRG’s oil export, consumption and revenue for first half of 2017. We are issuing FAQ’s on KRG Oil & Gas sector and Infographics on oil exports and revenue for first half of 2017.
Stay tuned....
3531 2018-01-16 16:34:41 I used bio oil on my stretch marks and scars and they're seriously so much lighter
3532 2018-01-16 16:34:40 Norway is a capitalist society, especially rich because of oil (hence thanks to an unsustainable model), with social welfare. There is nothing "socialist" in Norway
3533 2018-01-16 16:34:32 Yup it maximizes profits in the short-term, but what if oil price increases a lot or how will they comply with regulations about emissions. That is a nightmare from an environmental point of view...
3534 2018-01-16 16:34:31 I swear by the woodlock Chinese oil
3535 2018-01-16 16:34:29 OK, to be fair, there was a correction from mid 2015 until early 2016 when the oil and oil stocks fall apart. It was mostly in time than price. The bid under the market revealed how strong this bull market is...
3536 2018-01-16 16:34:24 Lmao nasty ass lol have oil all his silk sheets
3537 2018-01-16 16:34:23 my friend drank castor oil and rocked on a yoga ball and went into labor early the next day

3539 2018-01-16 16:34:12 Find me one other market on the planet where China has bought 65%+ of annual production in short order & the price fell.  AFAIK, it never happened elsewhere, fr Vancouver RE to lobsters to avocadoes to oil to iron ore to copper to....

3564 2018-01-16 16:31:48 If the government truly wants to end Muslim appeasement, it should stop buying oil from Muslim countries. No more Muslim appeasement.

the refinery gets its

Rajasthan? only
from import. what

3568 2018-01-16 16:31:20 Not commenting on this call. However, fundamentally he was right about his tight oil thesis well before almost anyone else in 2015. Then market irrationality kicked in haha

3579 2018-01-16 16:30:20 #Petroleum The price of crude oil in the international market has increased, due to this, the oil company is increasing the price every alternate day.

3608 2018-01-16 16:27:33 I'm not. It does have a booming tourism industry, however. Also, Oregonians love to go to "the coast". A massive oil spill would ruin that.

3625 2018-01-16 16:25:32 Merit based? Like being from Norway? Anything to do with the fact Norway is the worlds 2nd largest exporter of oil I wonder?
3626 2018-01-16 16:25:30 Groundnut oil should score high too, if participation from #Maharashtra and #Gujarat is more. #Ghee and #MustardOil is ‘more’ north n east India.. will score high :-)
3627 2018-01-16 16:25:24 確かに似てるね（笑）
3628 2018-01-16 16:25:10 That's funny since Norway has womb to tomb socialism, 5 weeks paid  vacation, free university & oil corps must give large share of profits to the gov to pay for social welfare programs. IE high taxes  & socialism gets people to work hard @SecNielsen?
3629 2018-01-16 16:25:04 Keep Whitehorse Yukon on your radar (so to speak). Jr ditched his SS for his trip so something goes on up north. Perhaps just the usual oil/land rape with the Russians.

3634 2018-01-16 16:24:49 The only reason the fossil fuel industry exists is because we buy its gas, oil and coal which power our vehicles, industry, heat our homes, produce and transport our food, make plastics and medicines, etc. The byproduct is CO2 which increases food production. All good.
3635 2018-01-16 16:24:47 went in for an oil change. They told me I need a tire rotation and a new cabin air filter. I actually need to get the fuck out of here sometime today so just do the oil change already.

3642 2018-01-16 16:24:10 I see this go around and I am baffled as to the equivalency. If you want to avoid heart disease and cholesterol, you're actually better off with the oil.  But food is food? Like. IDGI.

A snake oil salesman actually gives you the snake oil when you pay him.
3653 2018-01-16 16:23:21 I love how people think that climate change, fossil fuel pollution, etc is all the fault of free markets, even though 90% of all oil produced is produced by government.

3670 2018-01-16 16:21:11 I don't see any source to cite these hidden costs you speak of.

If the U.S moves away from trade relations globally it will isolate itself, farms will fail due to market saturation and cost deterioration, oil prices will surge, and U.S will loose export markets to Europe / China

3673 2018-01-16 16:20:51 During the late 1800s, when the majority of Norwegians emigrated here, the country was known as a shithole. Norwegians were poor farmers with a reputation for alcoholism who fled a grim economy. They didn't prosper as a nation until they discovered oil maybe 50 years ago.

3680 2018-01-16 16:20:15 Actually, the Saudis ramped up production when American oil shale was booming to shut them down. And they said so openly and frequently.
3681 2018-01-16 16:20:14 I think I have mentally linked the smell of lavender oil with roast potatoes now.

3687 2018-01-16 16:20:02 But we only went to the ZLB b/c monetary policy contracted strongly in reaction to a supply (oil) shock! The ZLB is an anomaly. Not an "initial condition".

3702 2018-01-16 16:18:43 Succinct point on energy geopolitics/leverage from @IEABirol re US oil/gas boom at Senate hearing: "I am sure Secretary Tillerson, in the international negotiations with his counterparts, is sitting on his chair much more comfortably compared to his predecessors.”
3703 2018-01-16 16:18:35 @msnbc When the President of the USA and politicians are more interested in "self enrichment" than "we the people" America suffers. Those same politicians keep looking the other way as FOREIGN HFT et al raise gas/heating oil at the CCM.
3704 2018-01-16 16:18:28 Iraq was a war of aggression. It was an illegal war that bush started and Obama continued. Iraq didn't have weapons of mass destruction and didn't attack us on 9/11. It was a war for oil. #PetroDollar

3708 2018-01-16 16:18:13 What is funny is that Norway used to champion their racist free society. That is until they got oil rich and imported cheaper labour creating what amounts to a service class. Now they have nazi groups. They just needed someone different to hate.
3709 2018-01-16 16:18:04 Trabalhei com uma mulher super competente na área de Oil&gas que dividia o departamento com um cara bem mais velho q ela.

3711 2018-01-16 16:17:56 Yeah, that was my first reaction. I might use 3 TBS of oil on a rice dish or on bread or hummus or whatever. If I did that it's for flavor and/or because it fills me up and/or because that suits my digestive system best! What gives?

3720 2018-01-16 16:16:17 Why was that piece of Luoland renamed DUUR KAANA? It is because there are underground rivers of WATER as well as OIL in Turkana.  Luo ancestors used to say that in all parts of that land, if you lie on the ground and place your ear on it, you will hear the sound of running water.

3734 2018-01-16 16:15:12 So my car was leaking oil all over the parking lot by the time I got to work. I'm at the dealer now, which is no fun. I'm worried that this time the problem might be terminal.

3743 2018-01-16 16:14:09 Although the most amazing thing about lavender oil is if you burn yourself on the oven etc, stick some on the burn and it’s gone in minutes. 
Amazing how quickly it works versus dunking in cold water that still hurts after hours.
3744 2018-01-16 16:14:08 Had a Norwegian passenger once. He’d work a month pressing buttons on an oil rig then have a month off where he’d do nothing but pound beers and fish.
3745 2018-01-16 16:13:47 Lmao I’m glad you’re over that phase because aye. Is it an oil ad?

3885 2018-01-16 15:56:34 The assessor in Dickinson, ND raised my assessed values during the oil boom but has refused to lower them after the bust in 2015. #REAL ESTATE TAX REVOLT

3888 2018-01-16 15:55:53 Their oil ventures.  That's totally a Russian play.

Kudos to you girl!  This is done of the best reporting I've seen-period.   .

I'll bet it goes deeper and we can correlate Russian arctic drilling and naval deployments to protect said arctic drilling, with their goals.
3889 2018-01-16 15:55:28 cooking smth in oil and checking if the oil is hot enough by shaking a few droplets of water in it (as opposed to.. literally any other safe method?)
in this kitchen we die like men
3890 2018-01-16 15:55:27 Listen! Putting oil on the bottom half of my legs..........and putting my shoes on. I be wanting to cry
3891 2018-01-16 15:55:14 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.
3892 2018-01-16 15:55:14 depende nmn sa mayo at banana un!! :'((

3896 2018-01-16 15:55:04 Have you tried Shea butter on your skin? It helped me out a lot when I lived in Detroit because the cold weather dried me out. & I’ve been using sweet almond oil on my face, if it’s super dry you can put aloe Vera gel on as well.
3897 2018-01-16 15:55:01 WSJ: Oil briefly reaches $70 as buoyant global economy bolsters demand
3898 2018-01-16 15:55:00 Don't worry our leaders will COVER UP FOR THE OIL COMPANIES!Just like they did in our gulf of Mexico! Took all the money & screwed the Ocean & people, Obama stole millions! Gulf is a toxic chemical pool!

3900 2018-01-16 15:54:59 Yes unfettered capitalism leads to kleptocracy, you are starting to get it..slowly. And socialism isn't opposed to oil. 

I love when people quote my tweets. It gives me the opportunity to correct them twice.

3902 2018-01-16 15:54:22 The APC government did not just fail,  it fails in all deliverables it set for itself. Name it: governance, security, job creation, food sufficiency, electricity, oil and gas, ease of doing business, etc. This government has performed far below minimum expected substandard.

3904 2018-01-16 15:54:18 Than why when oil goes down it hits/hurt Alberta very badly that’s means the rate of diversification of industries is less compare to oil industry.
3905 2018-01-16 15:54:18 i need some castro oil
3906 2018-01-16 15:54:07 Sponsoring #TuckerCarlson #Tucker  I'll be steering clear of Exxon good thing Cumberland farms is close by hello Gulf oil.
3907 2018-01-16 15:54:06 Yes. Oil is good energy.
3908 2018-01-16 15:54:06 Measure five grams of olive oil and whisk briskly.
3909 2018-01-16 15:54:00 A more useful example: ‘Oil development can help create opportunities for divers on decommissioned reefs off the coast of x state. Here’s a link to a journal article on decommissioned rig biodiversity.’ #BOEMPublicMeeting 17/
3910 2018-01-16 15:53:53 Never waiting again this late to get an oil change smh
3911 2018-01-16 15:53:41 Se quejan del costo del gas oíl y salen en tractores y camionetas a protestar, Uruguay inteligencia. Es como ir al gimnasio en auto jajajaja. Vengan de a mil.
3912 2018-01-16 15:53:40 I see a potential CSR component within  V.Props if they affect segments and corporate governance in your M - POLISM. If you have strong -ve stakeholders i.e. oil ind, then maybe seperate too.
 It also makes me think of the area outside of the BMC "environment" constraining BMC.
3913 2018-01-16 15:53:40 Nigerian stocks jump to 9-year high on oil price

To those that are not blind, #ThisIsChange

3915 2018-01-16 15:53:40 Keeping an eye on those oil prices. It’s at the 70 dollars/barrel mark.
3916 2018-01-16 15:53:36 I think I still have oil on me from that session. Wow

3928 2018-01-16 15:52:13 I've spent the better part of this morning exfoliating and massaging oil into my ass.  Wish you were here 
3929 2018-01-16 15:52:02 そんなかんじでしょうね…。早くみたい。
3930 2018-01-16 15:51:50 Your post are needed. One passage that strikes me is the 10 virgins. 5 were ready filled with oil, another 5 were not prepared. But most daunting is all 10 feel into a deep slumber. Spiritual slumber may be due to an end time spiritual famine. The state of the church is lacking.
3931 2018-01-16 15:51:27 Last week, the MSM headlines tout " Gas prices on the Rise in 2018" yet Reuters has a headline today (Jan 16, 2018) that states "U.S. oil industry set to break record, upend global trade..." WTF ???
3932 2018-01-16 15:51:02 i borrowed my dad’s liniment oil (that i gave to him as a souvenir from bkk haha) but now i’ve practically used it up ha haha ha
3933 2018-01-16 15:51:00 Yeah.  I’m down with that.  And can you sprinkle a little extra cheese on my oil, please?
3934 2018-01-16 15:50:59 No, Trump doesn't deserve much credit for:
- finding a robustly growing economy and riding that wave;
- creating a stock market bubble based on dismantling health/safety/environmental protections;
- encouraging unsustainable industries (coal, oil);
- doing nothing for workers.
3935 2018-01-16 15:50:59 Thinking about chili oil
3936 2018-01-16 15:50:33 And he delivered what he promised, a REAL CHANGE! The ignoramus had no idea they were voting for their own demise. Sadly many still believe that the sunny days are coming.

3946 2018-01-16 15:49:48 That would make me more likely to eat pizza, who the hell wants to swallow 3 spoons of warm oil?
3947 2018-01-16 15:49:38 To soothe the reaction or in place of Tea Tree Oil?!
3948 2018-01-16 15:49:30 Yeah...my husband took my cake carrier to the garage-he was changing the oil. He used it to catch the oil. 
I have my Tupperware in a locked cabinet.
3949 2018-01-16 15:49:29 She works quick, meat seasoned and soon slipped into the oven. Then the stove is turned on, coming to life as she coats a pan in oil. The vegetables are placed into it, sizzling as they come into contact with the heat.
3950 2018-01-16 15:49:16 U can bet that Schumer is burning the midnight oil
3951 2018-01-16 15:49:11 Yeah I usually slice it crosswise almost all the way through and pour olive oil and salt and bake it at like 350 for a while (idk, google it for better instructions lol) and then pull it out and either eat it like that or put cheese on it and dip it in sour cream or ranch
3952 2018-01-16 15:49:09 As long as the oil is warm

3955 2018-01-16 15:48:45 Quietly this #Iranian oil spill is looking like the worst in 5 decades if all the oil the tanker was carrying leaks...dwarfing the Exxon Valdez
3956 2018-01-16 15:48:42 I feel like this just advocates eating two slices of pizza and assures me not consuming 3 spoons of oil, which I had no plans to do (but if I did, now I know I should replace it with two much more filling slices of pizza).

Mmmmm
3957 2018-01-16 15:48:35 Of course they should. Reserved to WM who are in cahoots with the oil firms so won’t  happen.

They should subsidize oil price so every class and religion of people get benefits. Nataki Government's trick.

3966 2018-01-16 15:46:32 Oil isn't bad for you unless it's a bad oil like corn, soy or other trans fat type.
3967 2018-01-16 15:46:27 I’m not a fan of how he talks on social media etc but can’t deny what he has done so far in last 6 months. Speaking from experience the unemployment is down b/c he took a lot of restrictions off of oil rigs,coal mines etc. that alone was a million jobs back in society.
3968 2018-01-16 15:46:20 How is that different to me using a drop of oil from my bottle of peppermint essential oil (which has been approved by governing bodies as safe for internal use/food flavouring and is labeled this way on the bottle) with a tsp of sunflower oil in my baking?
3969 2018-01-16 15:46:04 @NDTV the headline of news at 9, regarding largest ever oil spill, without mentioning (east China sea) is in a v poor taste. This is what @Nidhi say spreading negativity. The moment v hear such destruction, it disturbs, & thinking that it can b around India, is more disturbing!
3970 2018-01-16 15:46:01 Nope.. no green arrows yet:)
3971 2018-01-16 15:45:53 Then I'm definitely calling you red oil

3973 2018-01-16 15:45:27 Not too keen on the oil. Pizza4eva
3974 2018-01-16 15:45:21 I’ve never fried them, but I bake them in olive oil and salt in the oven and then add cheese if I have cheese
3975 2018-01-16 15:44:57 So agree! Warmed olive oil with spices on a plate to then dip crusty fresh baked bread in...   One of the greatest (and simplest) culinary wonders of deliciousness.
3976 2018-01-16 15:44:54 I’m not understanding why this oil change is taking longer than 20 minutes
3977 2018-01-16 15:44:52 Thats a good question & got me thking what IS my point of break? I have certainly been tested on positions over the years trading. Oil more than any for sure. In fact I recall $7k move against me while up leisure flight in my plane...it was that moment I realized size matters.
3978 2018-01-16 15:44:10 Oil prices at $70. 
A return to good times ? 
Maybe not so fast.

3980 2018-01-16 15:43:44 I also really suggest sitting with some coconut oil on your face for a little while. It really helps renew the moisture barrier and lock in moisture. Bonus: smells good! 
3981 2018-01-16 15:43:43 Saddam Hussein calls up the US Ambassador and says he is interested in invading Kuwait. Is this OK with the USA?  We say “Yes, go ahead. We don’t care.”  Iraq invades. Suddenly, it’s “This aggression will not stand...” The USA wants a presence near the oil & Iraq provides
3982 2018-01-16 15:43:43 All i wanna do after work/school today is go home, pour some wine, turn on the oil diffuser and hang my new curtains. I’m officially old as sh*t
3983 2018-01-16 15:43:43 The middle 20%...will decide it. Full on Brexit is mad. Use oil for pension top ups to the lousy UK pension wherever you live not to pay Tory millionaires in bailouts.

3995 2018-01-16 15:42:33 All these bullshit fad diets now a days saying you have to be no carbs or have to be gluten free or vegan. All I fucking eat is chicken, beef, eggs, fish, oats, rice, sweet potato, avocado, olive oil, almonds... and I'm in best shape/ healthiest ive ever been in my life. Wake up!
3996 2018-01-16 15:42:26 Yes, I love the first, I’ve seen it a million times! I’ll try the new one again. 
3997 2018-01-16 15:42:18 Sell crude oil cmp 4107 sl 4130 tgt 4065 time one to two days
3998 2018-01-16 15:42:17 Also, yes, I like warm oil. I might put it on toast or something, but it sounds like a lovely thing.
3999 2018-01-16 15:42:14 E non dimentichiamo i trend macroeconomici di cui abbiamo discusso qualche giorno fa connessi alla situazione geopolitica globale e, soprattutto, l'andamento del greggio! #Keynes #BTC #Trump #OIL

4006 2018-01-16 15:40:11 I had to sell and rebuy oil. But I don't think we lose 64.20. The top of the opening range
4007 2018-01-16 15:40:10 I’m not talking about lemon essential oil being found in lemons. I’m talking about like peppermint extract which is  peppermint oil and sunflower oil. A 60ml bottle diluted at 1% would contain 12 drops of peppermint oil. If you use a tsp in your cooking you’ve added 1 drop of EO.
4008 2018-01-16 15:40:09 え、エクストラヴァージンオリーブオイルなのに飲みすぎると体に悪いんですか？

4012 2018-01-16 15:39:48 Rubbing clary sage oil mixed with a body oil, (just a few drops) onto your bump will do the trick! Worked for me twice 
4013 2018-01-16 15:39:44 Why are ppl so obsessed with the "health benefits" of oil. Yeah it tastes good and makes shit crispy and I'm all for that but if you're like drinking it for the omegas just eat the fucking food it came from. It's cheaper and better for you like cmonnnnn.
4014 2018-01-16 15:39:30 Thanks  Lesley told me that she was served this by Palestinians for breakfast, with freshly baked bread n olive oil. They dip the bread first in olive oil and the on this.

4017 2018-01-16 15:39:06 How about weed/CBD oil?  I’ve heard that cannabis helps the symptoms of fibromyalgia.
4018 2018-01-16 15:38:48 Like I told someone yesterday. The easiest way is to use sleep darts on guards so they can’t move, then just find a oil jar, carry it over to them and place it on the ground next to them. Then just shoot the oil jar with a fire arrow

Continuous petrol price hike , for last 15 months irrespective of international crude oil price will slow down the economy.
Govt. Should wakeup before it is too late.

4043 2018-01-16 15:35:59 It would be nice if our Canadian government would remember that there’s more to our great nation than Ontario and Quebec. Alberta has been devastated by the drop in the oil industry and you support just the provinces closest to you
4044 2018-01-16 15:35:49 Just got done getting an oil change at teh quikkeelube. Great service. Coffee was just right. Tepid and weak.

4075 2018-01-16 15:32:34 Apricot kernel oil has a very high absorption rate and low rancidity value compared to other oils. It gets to the core of the rope easily but leaves a relatively dry hand. It's fairly similar to camellia oil in these properties but a lot less expensive.
4076 2018-01-16 15:32:20 Couples Court is playing while I get my oil changed. Initial thoughts: there has to be a more convenient, adult, and cost-effective way to address your relationship issues.

4078 2018-01-16 15:32:17 weird that seizing the means of production led to a complete economic crash and inability to manage the greatest oil reserves.

4160 2018-01-16 15:22:16 Oil? Nope. Water? Nope. Power? Nope. Fish? Nope. Hmmm. HP sauce? Nope (made in Holland now). 
Ah, I know! Colemans mustard? 
Yes! (but no for much longer as Unilever moving production to Germany)

4163 2018-01-16 15:21:52 Robert and Ludwig Nobel, the Swedish brothers of dynamite—inventor Alfred, quickly developed Baku-based oil production and refining and became a major supplier to Czarist Russia
4164 2018-01-16 15:21:41 Heart disease is the #1 killer in the country.  Whole food, plant based nutrition is the only diet clinically proven to REVERSE heart disease...  so.. why isn't it OUR standard?  Raise taxes on MEAT, OIL & DAIRY!  SUBSIDIZE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES
4165 2018-01-16 15:21:39 i can get IQfeed for $78 per month according to sierrachart website
4166 2018-01-16 15:21:15 @pnvijay you need to tell moron MK Venu that Oil price 30 Rs per liter is crude oil & add to that FX/Refining charges. Dont let him get them away with open lies
4167 2018-01-16 15:21:06 I would wash the oil down with two large slices of pizza 
4168 2018-01-16 15:20:53 So now, you want to make a comparison to a single oil producing province ?
  
Israel, by itself, has done more technologically, than all of the Muslim world; and only from 1948.  Inventions from the US and Western Europe, account for ALL of the technology we use today.
4169 2018-01-16 15:20:52 Khane mein oil bhar bhar k dalna , logo ki toii par marna aur crocodile tears nikalna aur task to bilkul bhi nahi karna aur thnkew salmaan kehna bhi sheekh k zarur jana

4171 2018-01-16 15:20:25 Is this the same Turkey that was supplying weapons and support to ISIS, funding them by buying oil,allowing a porous border to supply fighters? That's your real double standards
4172 2018-01-16 15:20:25 U.S. oil industry set to break Barkley, upend global trade @LizHampton1986
4173 2018-01-16 15:20:17 So .@Valvoline tells me to keep my receipts after I had to replace parts on my car after an OIL CHANGE  that left my car undriveable for a day I’ve called for the manager TWICE and no one has gotten back to me. I won’t be going back there. Ever.
4174 2018-01-16 15:20:14 Appaz, because oil went up they want to "defend" the $ some more.
4175 2018-01-16 15:20:00 i think i pay $10 a month for cqg data through sierrachart
4176 2018-01-16 15:19:44 don't forget keeping a bunch of oil in a tanker somewhere and trading some contracts on it
4177 2018-01-16 15:19:42 Rapeseed Oil, Water, Wheat Flour, Potato Starch mixed with the fish
4178 2018-01-16 15:19:27 No, no! They have too much oil. 
4179 2018-01-16 15:19:25 Wow! It looks like Steve Bannon combed his hair & changed the oil for his testimony today!
4180 2018-01-16 15:19:21 Terrible. I just want him to leave. If MKhi comes, more creative with Ozil Oil to get the ball to Laca.

4184 2018-01-16 15:18:41 Thanks to NAFTA, car manufacturers in Alabama ship to Canada and Mexico. Canada sends huge volumes of unrefined oil south which is then refined and sent back north, again supporting U.S jobs. NAFTA is directly responsible for at least 1.6 million service jobs alone.
4185 2018-01-16 15:18:07 Here early at @ValleyHiHonda getting an oil change before the Wife goes to work. Have to take care of the car so it will take care of us.
4186 2018-01-16 15:18:07 It's just hydrogenated vegetable oil to make it solid at room temperature.
4187 2018-01-16 15:17:57 The thing is though welfare is small fry compared to what we pay out on fighting pointless oil wars and the tax avoiding the rich do. Welfare will always be needed when the cost of working is more than than not working. We don't have enough to help working parents.
4188 2018-01-16 15:17:54 Everything you need to know about markets today is that markets grow, currencies are weak, oil prices are just slightly lower from 3-year highs. Indices are set to break records in opening trades, as demand for technology stocks breathes new life into the rally around the world.
4189 2018-01-16 15:17:51 Israel has been a friend which was left alone for the greed of oil..great going .lot to do.
4190 2018-01-16 15:17:43 Wait, what?

You told us the oil was running out!
4191 2018-01-16 15:17:23 Just listening to TKC somebody mentioned tabouleh. Having eaten it all my l de in southern France I hag never ever once heard of a vinaigrette in tabouleh. The grain is soaked with lemon juice the dressing is simply that and olive oil. There is no garlic either.
4192 2018-01-16 15:17:17 Don't trust any of the clubs sayings they are not trying to sign Sanchez
Well would you trust a russian duck seller or a human rights abusing oil rustler.
4193 2018-01-16 15:17:16 You know when you haven’t done an oil mask in a month because of exams and your hairs just looking dry af and you curl pattern is just doing up retard

4196 2018-01-16 15:17:08 Our planet is not indestructible, the environment is more fragile than it looks..
We should really, REALLY be funding clean, renewable energy sources instead of oil, gas and coal.
It's imperative to not only our own health, but our planet too.
4197 2018-01-16 15:17:06 Think of how much dirt & oil builds up on makeup brushes after each use. Wash them with a brush cleaner often.
4198 2018-01-16 15:17:03 GP Just because partially hydrogenated soy and other oil blend isn't what you'd call "natural" doesn't make it bad and wrong, food hippie!

4202 2018-01-16 15:16:45 Nice one . Met a 20 year old—parents immigrated here from Cambodia. Born here. His hands were crippled by working on oil lines in TX for 7 years, and he had several other physical problems related to work.  Talked about the beauty of nature. Rob needs some perspective.
4203 2018-01-16 15:16:45 Russian economy nearly collapsed so they built their industries internally. There is more, blah blah federal reserve and opec oil cartel. China is at like 300% debt to gdp, the debt is to foreign banks mainly, winning a war would wipe that. China is in trade war with us.
4204 2018-01-16 15:16:41 @OnlyNaturalPet I see you have alot more choices of CBD oil. I had purchased the pet relief brand last year but didn't find it helpful at all. Can you recommend any of the new choices available please?
4205 2018-01-16 15:16:34 EVER like how is a Groupon for an oil change equivalent to 7 Groupon destination emails?? Haha
4206 2018-01-16 15:16:31 Looking for a job at the oil and gas industry!
4207 2018-01-16 15:16:28 What a twit. If it weren't for pot, specifically CBD oil, I couldn't live with my fibromyalgia & arthritis symptoms. You don't want it? Fine! Don't partake. But leave me alone. Adults have a Right to enjoy & improve the quality of their lives & if that includes pot, so be it.

4211 2018-01-16 15:15:51 You seem to be under the false belief that the EU is an incorporating or federal union like Germany or UK rather than a supranational union. EU's powers are limited and don't include powers of oil and gas.
4212 2018-01-16 15:15:38 And Oil!
4213 2018-01-16 15:15:26 Oh such fresh crispy lot! I don't mind having it for all the 3 meals. Love south Indian food. Only condition-should be freshly made.  And no cheap oil pls.
4214 2018-01-16 15:15:18 SB 550, Gulf of Mexico Range Complex, by Sen. Broxson was heard in the Senate Environmental Preservation & Conservation Cmte. SB 550 is a resolution to Congress supporting an extension of the current moratorium on oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico.

4232 2018-01-16 15:13:30 Trump has opened offshore oil drilling for every State bordering the oceans and Gulfs, except Florida’s because his Mar a Lago Golf Course is there and off the coast of either the Gulf of Mexico, or the Ocean and it might get an oil spill!

4273 2018-01-16 15:08:52 Warm olive oil is pretty nice, provided it is decent oil.
4274 2018-01-16 15:08:39 Yes the continental shelf where oil is located off Va is 50-70 miles offshore. These platforms could bring 1000s of high paying jobs to our area, at minimal risk of a spill ever occurring, and even in the unlikely event of a spill, the current would carry oil to sea.

4282 2018-01-16 15:07:59 Warm olive oil, not cold, couple of drops will soften any wax, need to leave it in for 15 min, or Earex I think is called from chemist.
4283 2018-01-16 15:07:59 Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel moisturizer is bomb for oil control.
4284 2018-01-16 15:07:55 Yes- we believe this statement and that's why in CG we know that playing with you in the Oil and Gas space is you doing nothing but "Walking the talk"- Kudos to you from all of us @ CG!

4290 2018-01-16 15:07:36 I worked in oil exploration for 25 years. Worked on jobs all over the world. The only places we had people taken hostage was in Africa. Bribery and ransom money are just considered cost of doing business there. Call it what ever kind of hole you want, it fits.

4295 2018-01-16 15:07:14 Shares of BP down by 3%. That $1.7B oil spill charge did a madness
4296 2018-01-16 15:06:51 Demand for plastics & other petro products will continue to grow but probably won’t ever come close to demand for crude oil for transportation. OTOH, oil companies can make a lot of money producing and selling plastics products
4297 2018-01-16 15:06:32 It's simple. India, a rising superpower cannot afford to gain grudges from 100+ countries, especially oil exporting Arab countries by voting against them. 
It was a pure strategic move forged out of necessity which even the Israelis understand.

4303 2018-01-16 15:05:51 Petrol prices nearing 80 Rs. Where are acche din? You never passed the benefits when crude oil was low. Now making citizens suffer with sky high oil prices

4312 2018-01-16 15:04:59 The price fixing claims against Tyson are similar to behavior you'd see from an oil cartel (if proven).  Slaughtering breeder chickens to limit supply and drive up prices.
4313 2018-01-16 15:04:55 Thank you dear, I’d just use vegetable oil like that
4314 2018-01-16 15:04:52 今はマンダムのディアフローラ・oil in hand&nailcream使ってるけど……
4315 2018-01-16 15:04:44 If you like drinking fryer oil from a straw. 
Go @Whataburger or go home.
4316 2018-01-16 15:04:43 I mean, these are also, barring occasional oil booms, the only places to get jobs - America, by and large, stopped building two decades ago. It just hurts worse in the places people have to compete to be.

4323 2018-01-16 15:04:24 I need a face moisturizer that also controls oil. Any suggests?

4326 2018-01-16 15:04:16 Tastes better than warm oil. So, yes.

4328 2018-01-16 15:04:06 Totally 4got I need a damn oil change n everywhere packed  not how I wanna spend my morning
4329 2018-01-16 15:04:01 The oil boom is REAL, but the export choke point will soon become the lagging US Port infrastructure.  The ship channels in Port Arthur, Corpus, and Houstoaccount for 85-90% of US crude exports, They are all in serious need of deepening to accommodate new Panamax draft vessels.
4330 2018-01-16 15:04:00 Crude oil $WTI sentiment is at 94,  another candidate due for a pullback along with the metals $GLD (Gold) sentiment at 88.

4335 2018-01-16 15:03:20 This is how it's been from the start. Solar found its first major commercial funding in the oil industry, powering offshore platforms and corrosion protection for pipelines. And that is why we need continuous aggressive policy.

4343 2018-01-16 15:02:51 I started out with the same work out! Then I remembered there was a contractor who was coming by this morning to retrieve some things, as well as the oil man could have shown up at any time...Out came the snow blower!
4344 2018-01-16 15:02:19 With all  this oil and the citizens are dying like this
4345 2018-01-16 15:02:19 Brent oil staying above US$60/bbl for any lengthy time will put pressure on labour costs in Mining to rise, particularly Canada because of demand for staff returning to tar sands sector. Smaller pool of future skilled staff on job offers across whole sector to result.
4346 2018-01-16 15:02:14 I take Vit D and a MultiVit in an oral spray form for better absorption. I also use a magnesium oil transdermal spray.

4350 2018-01-16 15:00:55 I have also seen that oil cleansing works really well when dry weather gives you gross dead-looking skin but acids feel too harsh and regular exfoliating/cleansing just strip too much moisture

4363 2018-01-16 14:59:43 Prevention & community centred approaches are like turning an oil tanker around. Not enough trust in other orgs.
4364 2018-01-16 14:59:39 Wow, really? It's very easy and very tasty!
If there is sesame oil, it will smell better.

4370 2018-01-16 14:58:48 There is no Oil off of Washington State you must of been thinking that Alaska is part of Washington State.
4371 2018-01-16 14:58:36 Dow up 1000 points in just 7 days!  Gotta love index funds! . Domestic oil production about to set an all time record. Happy Days are indeed here again!  Just like President Reagan and the 80's!  I'll be listening to Blondie on the way home!  
4372 2018-01-16 14:58:34 This has massive potential beneficial  implications for tight oil & gas fracking!
4373 2018-01-16 14:58:28 expecting #USD strength from close to these levels. Expecting oil to have a significant correction given positioning & sentiment. I'm a huge #gold bull over long-term. I think we could see gold back to $1,286. Maybe lower but need significant #USD strength to push it much lower
4374 2018-01-16 14:58:10 Keep our oil there is NO green power.
4375 2018-01-16 14:57:58 Coutinho, Oil, Eriksen all better than him in the PL this season. Iniesta, Busquets, Kroos, Modric, Verratti, Thiago all better than him. And maybe Paulinho

4406 2018-01-16 14:53:53 Here's my conspiracy theory: Oil companies are pushing OEMs to shift away from electric cars and focus on self-driving cars because self-driving cars still need gas cause they aint fuckin electric. Spread this shit.
4407 2018-01-16 14:53:53 Thanks Martin.God knows what will happen when an oil tanker is spotted!

4410 2018-01-16 14:53:09 Now that you mention it, better make it 4.5 spoons of warm oil
4411 2018-01-16 14:53:08 Not just that, it also shows that the people running the oil sector have exhibited crass incompetence and are thus not fit for office

4416 2018-01-16 14:52:41 This is super interesting, but how much of our demand for oil can be offset by demand for plastics?
4417 2018-01-16 14:52:19 hehe, .... what kind of oil?

4422 2018-01-16 14:51:40 Heck, I have that much oil just drip off my pizza
4423 2018-01-16 14:51:38 There's a right and wrong type of oil change. Make sure you use oil that has the right viscosity, or thickness, for your vehicle and for this time of year. Oil tends to thicken as it gets colder.
4424 2018-01-16 14:51:30 Climate change and oil economy threaten national security and the safety and health of all human life. There is enough oil with existing wells. Create jobs by building green energy structure. It's past time to begin transition to renewables.
4425 2018-01-16 14:50:56 why are people in porn always so greasy. can i have some napkins to dab off the extra oil. do you have this in matte.
4426 2018-01-16 14:50:55 Says the man who supports an economic system that has ,instead of having an oil fund of billions,ran up £1.8 trillion debt. You guys are priceless
4427 2018-01-16 14:50:48 If you ain’t sleepin w an essential oil diffuser, then you ain’t truly sleepin. Hi, I’m 78 years old.
4428 2018-01-16 14:50:43 It's not a tidal zone. Research what the gulf stream is and you will understand how oil drilled 50+ miles offshore will never spill and wind up on shores. I wouldn't risk mucking up my livelihood. I see the need for oil and my local economy could use the $$$ and jobs.

4430 2018-01-16 14:50:18 No, they're mindless. Right! This has been a hoot but I must return to my actual job of editing an oil and gas magazine for the African market because I am a total liberal snowflake clearly in need of a safe space...
4431 2018-01-16 14:50:17 So, who appointed you to represent black people?  Did you ever have an ounce of an open mind to consider that some blacks dont think like you?  After years of buying the snake oil sold to blacks by dems isnt it time to look elsewhere for new ideas?
4432 2018-01-16 14:50:07  you are a . You called black NFL players Sons of Bitches. You’ve called a whole continent & some. Shitholes. These places are filled with Black & Brown folks.

4439 2018-01-16 14:48:49 i can see why you want that 28 though, fill in the volume gap, interesting
4440 2018-01-16 14:48:44 Buy the dip mode oil and gold stocks.  At levels that makes sense on a risk reward set up of course.
4441 2018-01-16 14:48:43 Oil is priced in dollars...price of the USD impacts buying or selling oil in a foreign currency.  If price of your currency vs USD starts off at 1:1 and oil is $50/bbl, if oil increases 20% (to $60/bbl) while USD falls 20% (.8:1)...no demand destruction as oil price to you same
4442 2018-01-16 14:48:39 you already use cannabis oil for the side effects? or you good?
4443 2018-01-16 14:48:25 how much should an oil change cost? #damselindistress
4444 2018-01-16 14:48:11 Oven roast! Olive oil, salt, pepper, 350° stirring every 10 minutes until they are beautifully brown/black, like IKEA furniture.
4445 2018-01-16 14:48:03 they sell it quick but it doesnt stay down near 64 for long, buyers held that

4447 2018-01-16 14:47:58 It’s in the interest of Raiola - he’s involved now &eyeing up a big fee 
I remember SAF saying in his  when he met Raiola they were like ‘oil &water’ &they didn’t get on
But I’m with you - Sanchez  Micki let’s get it done!
It’s apparently a straight swap, no transfer fee
4448 2018-01-16 14:47:53 Conservative party had 60years to divest the albertans into different area of businesses but like BUTT. Kept going into shithole of oil gasoline it’s like putting all the money you earned into stock markets(usually the same stock) that’s what happens being closed narrow minded.
4449 2018-01-16 14:47:48 Got my oil change done, phone bill next might leave with a Apple Watch idk if it’s worth it
4450 2018-01-16 14:47:44 Yep - trust her. (And us.) Just one spoon of oil = insanely delish (and low fat) chips.
4451 2018-01-16 14:47:13 Nigeria's Crude Oil Production Hit 2.057mbpd in December

Nigeria's crude oil production, including condensate hit 2.057 million barrels per day (bpd) in the month of December 2017. This is higher than the 1.93 million bpd including condensate recorded at  end of Q3 2017.
4452 2018-01-16 14:47:09 It doesn’t matter anyway cause @DebonairsPizza never presents equal slices so whatever calculation they used...it may never be that I eat 3 spoons of oil
4453 2018-01-16 14:47:06 อืม ทีมนั้นหาที่ลงยากจริงๆ มันลงตัวไปหมด

4456 2018-01-16 14:46:28 @MegynKelly used to work at @FoxNews

todays story about a whore talking about another whores affair with Trump
 that even the whore denies
followed by a tapping snake oil salesman

U cant make this up

4458 2018-01-16 14:45:33 @msnbc TRUMP likes to take claim for rising stock markets up because WALL ST. TRAITORS in bed with VIRTU PARTNERS et al say so. The fact that VP is a FOREIGN ENTITY damaging "we the people" at the CCM should be reason for concern. Higher gas/heating oil?

4465 2018-01-16 14:45:01 Do you think USD will go down, oil will have a correction and gold will go lower? Are you bullish or bearish on gold long term? And how much do you think gold could correct?
4466 2018-01-16 14:45:00 @olaleyedada good afternoon, I rep #ManUtd . I wonder how some #arsenal fans are still optimistic about their club. Imagine ur caller saying they are selling their deadwood/waste product?
Is Sanchez and Oil a waste product? Well I guess the way #RVP was waste product Abi?
4467 2018-01-16 14:44:53 It’s effectively re-coating it. You bake oil onto it at high temp after scouring it down to bare metal.
4468 2018-01-16 14:44:41 One pop in the $USD and $SLV $SILVER and $OIL will plummet.. stops are very close to these level.. watch and learn $USO @Bamabroker

"Turn around now?"
4474 2018-01-16 14:43:48 Got up at 6:30am gave someone a ride, made $100, got my oil changed & went grocery shopping & it isn’t even 10am yet

4482 2018-01-16 14:43:03 #Buharimeter @buharimeter @PoeticPolicy @HassanIdayat @ayotundejunior could access to foreign exchange organise & define the oil market? Could it enhance the availability of our fuel?
4483 2018-01-16 14:42:19 Oil is a naturally occurring substance & has occurred naturally for millions of years. I've worked on the water at my home my entire life, yet some guy in California wants to inform me? You sound foolish. Keep your agenda on the west coast and leave my home out of your politics

4490 2018-01-16 14:41:21 The bigger the numbrer, the more interested I get in "what was the memo?"  I suppose world leaders are quietly trying to prepare for the day that oil runs out and perhaps they "know something" about the actual dates and it's not too far off.  Like within 50 years.
4491 2018-01-16 14:41:21 There is an unacknowledged and deep-seated belief in many Albertans that we have a divine right to an unending oil boom.

We never said people come first, but we behaved as though they did. #WalkTheWalk came 1st!

4579 2018-01-16 14:31:01 For the lips of the adulterous woman drip honey,and her speech is smoother than oil;
 but in the end she is bitter as gall,
sharp as a double-edged sword.
 Her feet go down to death;
her steps lead straight to the grave.
 She gives no thought to the way of life #PROVERBS

4591 2018-01-16 14:29:21 Allen Dulles admitted in an interview long ago that the purpose of entering Vietnam was to seize & plunder the natural resources of the country. The reason for the current PNAC wars in the ME is the same: to grab the natural resources, oil & gas. Only they won't tell the public.

4596 2018-01-16 14:28:41 Instead of eating Tide Pods why not learn to change the oil on a car or a tire? Maybe learn how to use tools! My father had us working on cars and laying concrete, aluminum siding and the like when we were teens.

4598 2018-01-16 14:28:30 This move was a signal to the oil and gas industry that they could dash for gas. It has backfired spectacularly as first onshore wind, then other renewables emerge as cheaper than new gas.

4604 2018-01-16 14:27:18 I also recall that the world's oil supply would run out by the year 2000 and the film future shock indicated that the population explosion would destroy our resources also by the year 2000.  I would rather watch your films

4631 2018-01-16 14:24:23 Surprised to see Ferrero is in the 'best buy #palmoilfree' chocolate section (in the guide) - i thought they weren't going to give up the palm oil - great IF they have - is this guide up to date??
4632 2018-01-16 14:24:15 No they're not oil based. You 99% alcohol to clean it. You can thin them with 70% alcohol to alter the colours.
4633 2018-01-16 14:24:14 They can’t eat oil. Rumor has it half of them will starve to death by spring.
4634 2018-01-16 14:24:11 Has cold oil got more calories or fewer? That's what I'd like to know.
4635 2018-01-16 14:24:06 And they will say the government is bad, is this person not a civilian killing his fellow man with adulterated palm oil, later he'll go and do thanksgiving in church.

4647 2018-01-16 14:22:21 and like you reminded earlier. 
Why the stronger EUR may not be a threat to inflation:
1 trade-weighted $EUR up 1.3% only vs. ECB staff. It rose by 5% after Sintra in 2017, & by 8%+ trough to peak.
2 At this stage, EUR=~5bp drag on core inflation but oil=~15bp boost vs. ECB fçst

4700 2018-01-16 14:16:59 C60 is fat soluble (ie. mixed with oil) and ingested. Stomach and gall bladder acids & enzymes emulsify for liver to distribute to body's cells via blood stream lipids. Cells then metabolize lipids for energy and C60 removes cell toxins for elimination.

5018 2018-01-16 13:33:05 For me it is tax cuts and watching illegals being deported on a daily basis

Oh and the pipelines and oil drilling expansion

Crap, also Gorsuch but that was last year but he will be on Supreme Court for DECADES

5023 2018-01-16 13:32:42 The first thing we need to do is switch to renewable energies. Big oil companies don't want you to think that it is a viable option, but it is. Currently we can't switch over 100% yet because the technologies have not been developed, but we can do enough to make a difference

5042 2018-01-16 13:30:02 I hate going to get my oil changed because they always try to sell you something else while you are there.
5043 2018-01-16 13:30:00 My body needs a oil change or something. Woke up and damn near every bone popped when I got up.
5044 2018-01-16 13:29:56 Try putting coconut oil on them before you go to bed. My sisters have grown out a lot and gotten thicker doing that
5045 2018-01-16 13:29:54 The eye patch has me intrigued -- I'm an eye bag man. Do they help? Aveda's wedding eye mask has been good for me. It's $$$ but lasts forever. Also, this might be TMI, but I get chest eczema & slathering myself in coconut oil every night really helps + smells delicious
5046 2018-01-16 13:29:53 Mmmm warm oil...
5047 2018-01-16 13:29:51 At the end of the day my business is about performing oil changes and that isn't that deep in itself, but the one on one interactions we have in the communities the stores are in are what create a sustainable business. Treating people well is not difficult, value intent.
5048 2018-01-16 13:29:43 At this point of their lives they really should know at least the basics of cooking but hobi literally just threw meat in a pan without pouring some oil I can’t breathe
5049 2018-01-16 13:29:08 I called in, and my boss is PISSED. Uh...excuse me for not wanting to 1, risk my life to get to a shit ass job and 2, potentially damage my car. I mean really, who the hell is gonna get their oil changed in this? I won’t be there much longer anyways 
5050 2018-01-16 13:28:59 But I am a 4 slice person. I worked with a person that liked extra olive oil on pizza

The oil company has made the largest investment decision in the North Sea since Maersk's gas field Culzean. The cautious era of the downturn is now over, according to an analyst.

5068 2018-01-16 13:27:27 9/11 happened because of the USA`s greed for oil
5069 2018-01-16 13:27:22 That can be done, subject to buying existing licences from other oil companies and/or buying new licences, but the most profitable time has passed. Norway has better managed its oil productions rates so has greater reserves remaining. It's never too late though.
5070 2018-01-16 13:27:20 Coconut oil liquefies at 77 degrees, so it would be very susceptible to congealing at freezing temps.

5078 2018-01-16 13:25:34 I live in an area where oil & gas drilling has been ongoing for decades as well as fracking.  There has not been any seismic activity here as it isn’t near fault lines.  Same in ND, where we were.  There were minor quakes hundreds of miles away in our state nowhere near fracking
5079 2018-01-16 13:25:30 Oil money may compensate AFC for the spectators lost for China's out. Faghani is the bete noire of Chinese football as he always gave disadvantageous (and controversial) decisions to Chinese teams in the Asian level. He's only 39 and he could referee for 2 WCs theoretically.

Blow mold HDPE (milk/water jugs) isn't worth much for recycling, but PET (soda bottles) fetches a bit more if cost of oil/barrel isn't too low.

5295 2018-01-16 12:54:01 Three broken promises from Yes/SNP: "We'd continue as EU member, no problems!", "We'll keep the £ and get a CU, no problems!", and "Oil is a bonus not a basis, we'll all be rich!".

5304 2018-01-16 12:52:52 Tip for condo-ing friends: you can cook some veggies with rice. Just add about a tbsp or more oil (olive, sesame, your choice) and about 2 tbsp of soy sauce. Not only save up, you'll also get a delicious meal.
5305 2018-01-16 12:52:51 I've been on this train now for an hour and two elderly men behind me will not stop talking about how their family tells them to deal with dry skin and whose way is better

5312 2018-01-16 12:52:07 US oil production hugely declined over the last week. Is it realistic to publish fantasy numbers?
5313 2018-01-16 12:52:00 Other incentives for Iran: Syria receives the fees ("money stays within family") and can pay its reconstruction with it,  which means Iranian (state/IRGC owned) oil companies can turn these  funds over to Iranian (state/IRGC owned) construction companies.
5314 2018-01-16 12:51:48 Smaller government?  Only when it suits them. What about state rights? What about an executive order to allow oil drilling off state’s coasts where they don’t want it? What about going after states that legalized medical or recreational marijuana? Goes on & on.

5441 2018-01-16 12:32:13 @realDonaldTrump If the U.S. is going to break world records in the oil industry, why does gas keep going up. Our gas prices should be lower than when you first sat in Obama’s Oval Office.
5442 2018-01-16 12:32:07 LOL. I have moved since. Thank F! But I did find wiping eucalyptus oil along the gaps I couldn't plug was pretty effective. I'm in the bush so I still get them but very infrequently inside here. Thanks for remembering LOL I was a basket case.

5500 2018-01-16 12:22:40 Pity Donald Trump & the #GOP are opening up vast swaths of coastline to oil drilling that will inevitably despoil many such beautiful environments. That's especially sad given that it's quite unnecessary because wind & solar are becoming as cheap or cheaper than oil or coal.
5501 2018-01-16 12:21:49 That's early dictatorial. It would have continued peacefully under Maduro, except oil prices tanked and the greedy little pig of a man closed the iron fist that Chavez left him, on the country.
5502 2018-01-16 12:21:49 It's a dill and cucumber sauce. Oil, vinegar, dill, cucumber, along with thinly sliced boiled potatoes.
5503 2018-01-16 12:21:37 Snack bar?
5504 2018-01-16 12:21:34 The Venezuelan collapse was because they didn't diversify the economy and instead went whole hog on oil exports because Chavez forced them to for years, inhibiting local business import & export & reducing more diversified business exports. Nothing about that is socialist. 1/2

5511 2018-01-16 12:21:08 What oil guy who is big into toys makes hundreds of thousands? Those who make hundreds of thousands are in higher management roles getting bonuses and are dedicated to their jobs, not playing with toys. The guy on the tools won’t ever get a sniff of that kind of money.
5512 2018-01-16 12:20:57 Seems like drinking three spoons of warm oil is the equivalent of two slices of pizza. Hmm. Need to start drinking more oil.

5515 2018-01-16 12:19:53 Planet Money, for fun stories about economics and markets - they just did a multi-part series wherein, to explain the market for satellites, they arranged to have their own satellite launched into space. They also did a multi-part where they bought and sold their own oil.
5516 2018-01-16 12:19:36 Some of them it do. But I just put the oil just in case.

5615 2018-01-16 12:04:02 just making stuff up is not a cogent argument, it's dog-whistle nonsense.
by the way oil is now $70 a barrel and more fields are still being discovered. 
if oil is so useless why does WM need Scotland so desperately?
5616 2018-01-16 12:03:57 #ukog #broadfordbridge The on-site storage capacity is somewhat of an unknown. So we may not see oil tankers just yet?
5617 2018-01-16 12:03:57 Bombed oil pipeline??? No... Hurricane destroys refineries??? No... Flat tire on tanker truck??? No... Why have they raised the price of gas so high??? Because they can...
5618 2018-01-16 12:03:53 Oil going up....brace yourself. Houston; we have a problem.
5619 2018-01-16 12:03:50 Were similar questions asked of podesta when he was making money from the russian oil company during the campaign?? Does anyone else see the accusational tone here??? Yes Jared should have been suspicious.

5672 2018-01-16 11:55:14 To soften your hands, rub your hands with warm olive oil, leave it on for 5-7 minutes, and rinse off with warm water.
5673 2018-01-16 11:55:10 It's all wrapped up in economics.   We were making moves to cut Russia out of trade with Europe... And to seal deals with the Pacific pact.  And now with trump, are distancing europe, but then going forward with more oil production to sell.  It doesn't make sense

5679 2018-01-16 11:54:21 It depends if you have mixed skin or if its naturally dry. Is it drying from the weather or is it naturally dry. Naturally dry skin needs oil based moisturizers so Aloe Vera will not work. If you have mixed skin that is drying from cold weather you need a water based moisturizer
5680 2018-01-16 11:54:01 I imagine that's why olive oil and such is really popular over in that Europe. It helps things slide down the throat easier, since their mouths are already far too overburdened with forrin'. You know, some of these countries actually have multiple official languages? Bizzare!

5697 2018-01-16 11:50:30 OK try this for facts. Brexit will lead to poverty, job losses, loss of international standing and influence and increased inequality. And you're on the side of Jo Cox's killer, posionous newspapers and liars and snake oil salesman like Farage and Johnson.
5698 2018-01-16 11:50:25 Most encouraging thing to me about current oil prices as a lot of it is being driven by strong demand for crude due to global economic growth and if that continues prices should continue to show strength
5699 2018-01-16 11:49:54 It's wrong to compare the oil price with the rig count. What is correct is to compare them vs the oil production designed around those rigs. @flacqua

5846 2018-01-16 11:18:47 The #UAE to be accused of exploiting passengers in its claim that #Qatar fighter jets intercepted #Emirates Airline planes. Don't let yourself dragged in a dangerous game. You're not a play toy to serve some oil sheiks. Safety first you surely find in your own country's carriers

- Asset base and bank balance firmly underpin current market cap

- Revenue increasing rapidly as oil price rises

Can see us trading much higher later this quarter

5854 2018-01-16 11:17:37 #VAST Looking to move back up - clearly finding a higher support now at 0.56p bid.

#UEN Buyers around. Very low free float and probably the cheapest oil producer on AIM, IMO at ~£8m MCAP 

#ORCP Slow burner probably, but the recent 2.3p placing gives confidence here.
5855 2018-01-16 11:16:47 Feels like a profit taking is setting up as oil, metals pullback, shorts in treasuries cover sending the 30yr up   half a point.

ES though up 15 at the time of this tweet will probably close lower than that 2804.

5990 2018-01-16 10:48:30 The only solution is for the refineries to operate,  so  that we don't have to take crude oil out,  refined and then returned at triple the cost.  So many people including your guest are hell bent on making sure it happens that way.
5991 2018-01-16 10:48:25 I have been there multiple times. It is the mercy of the Lord, that is why we are not consumed. Psalm 91:10 says that God will exalt our horn like the unicorn, he shall anoint us with fresh oil. And we shall see our desires upon our enemies.

6139 2018-01-16 10:16:31 As big as this story is, it's just another distraction from the oil rigs digging off our coast lines, except of course Florida where Mar-a-Lago is located.

However, you don’t get cold sweats, throwing up, and pale faced after not smoking for a day. Real addicts do.

6281 2018-01-16 09:48:10 Skysports getting really upset . So taking money from a club who's generated their own is wrong, but accepting it from a club backed by an oil rich state is fine, even if their owners sponsor genocide in Yemen? Hhmmm
6282 2018-01-16 09:48:05 First state in our country to get approval on oil refinery project #RajeOnRise
6283 2018-01-16 09:48:04 “Ohh. Hey dry palming it works too, or friction on soft fabric. Coconut oil also works a treat!”

Are they comparing techniques? Maybe. Bruno seems singularly unfazed by it if they are.
6284 2018-01-16 09:47:53 Yesterday I squeezed a oil tube with an air lock in it, the contents splattered out everywhere, result.
6285 2018-01-16 09:47:30 This oil refinery will generate so many jobs for the ppl n eventually there will b a rise in the gdp #RajeOnRise

6287 2018-01-16 09:46:54 girls like it when you’re meeting her parents over dinner and u take out a sharpie and start writing shit like “CVLT” and upside down crosses on their $10k oil paintings of lakes
6288 2018-01-16 09:46:45 Tapi olive oil mahal
6289 2018-01-16 09:46:40 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...
6290 2018-01-16 09:46:24 Not all petrol stations are owned by the company whose brand it carries. Some oil firms run dealerships where the dealer provides the assets while the company provides the oil and the branding. Usually beneficial to both parties.
6291 2018-01-16 09:46:22 He's not their President.
6292 2018-01-16 09:45:54 I knew I’d get support for this. Not much. But some. Now I just need to either 1) convince the rest of the olive oil loving population to elect me on a butter-based climate manifesto or 2) install a dictatorship. The latter may be easiest.
6293 2018-01-16 09:45:45 Udah coba skincarean dan pake face oil? '^'

6297 2018-01-16 09:44:40 Hi again Annabel. Good question! Our organic version has a different recipe and palm oil is needed for the texture as well as for room temperature storage (unlike the conventional version which goes in the chilled section). All the best, Oatly

6303 2018-01-16 09:42:35 The US is the #3 oil producer in the world. Doesn't suck to be America (well, not for this reason). But it will suck for #1 and #2, Russia and Saudi Arabia. Economic diversification is key :)

6317 2018-01-16 09:39:50 Strange story. Cheap oil isn't mentioned, which was instrumental to the population explosion, more than hygiene. Numbers are still growing, only on a lower rate. Likely to go up in world getting poorer. Global population growth now growing at 1.1% thus doubling in 65 years

6330 2018-01-16 09:37:05 Not possible due to most platforms exceeding design life. Plus, CRINE Cost Reduction In the New Era didn’t help!

6336 2018-01-16 09:35:52 Someone is playing dil mai baji guitar on my street with full volume and here I am putting oil in my hair. Wrong timing  
6337 2018-01-16 09:35:49 I had terrible hair fall after tonsillitis and castor oil helped in re growth. You use natural aloe for the mask? I comb my hair very rarely too. I use Argan oil or Moroccan oil and brush with my fingers
6338 2018-01-16 09:35:43 Hehehehehe. Coconut oil. 
6339 2018-01-16 09:35:21 Look at all that oil 
6340 2018-01-16 09:35:20 Zim is a mess.

But for some reason people think deodorant, lotion, sanitary wear, data are luxuries. I guess it's context.

6430 2018-01-16 09:21:49 I think your govt as an MP for it need to explain why they allowed this lot to win contracts when they issued profit warnings due to Brexit and Omani lower oil prices in 2016. The other 2 companies mentioned in 2016 with similar profit warnings need to be monitored too.
6431 2018-01-16 09:21:42 GBP “rally” is more about USD weakness. EURGBP was ~0.80 pre ref and now 0.8870, 5 big figs off post ref highs

6489 2018-01-16 09:12:31 At the moment oil is priced in USDs. The USA can control aspects of internal inflation by raising rates, making USD stronger and thereby lowering the oil price. Once usa is a net exporter then oil doesnt need to be priced in USDs and who is going to biy usds.
6490 2018-01-16 09:12:07 That's true, but perhaps I should give more context. It's about the propaganda in Iran's state broadcaster against anything western: investment, diplomacy, and food.

6565 2018-01-16 08:59:03 It's just a PR spin in case he does join Utd. They won't want "Sanchez snubs City for Utd". You know, considering they're apparently the best team the world has ever seen & have suddenly transformed from a small club with oil money into the biggest club on the planet.

6592 2018-01-16 08:54:03 If it grows on account of maritime drilling, then that’ll be even more interesting because (as I understand it) it is heavy sour crude. That’s what the gulf coast refineries are optimized for. Shale oil is light sweet, which serves a better purpose in exports due to global demand

6700 2018-01-16 08:37:58 Last night's dream.

I was getting a piggy back from @Adam_Gemili. We were chasing kids who put water in a cars oil tank. After we caught them Des Lynam shows up with @ColinJackson to inform Adam he broke 110m hurdle record jumping over cars.

Then things got really REALLY weird
6701 2018-01-16 08:37:55 At least United are spending money which is theirs, and earned! City are just given an endless pit of money from the oil guys
6702 2018-01-16 08:37:43 I am elated to be in Rajasthan that too for a project that will bring happiness and prosperity to the lives of many: PM Modi at inauguration of project commencement of oil refinery in Barmer

6708 2018-01-16 08:36:38 I think (based on COT report) the powers that be are planning an attack on Gold probably to coincide with the launch of the Yuan Oil contract - they'll need a dollar bounce of sorts to pull it off successfully though. Pullback to 1280-1300 - which would be very healthy anyway.
6709 2018-01-16 08:36:25 It’s garlic and herb sauce. I also added olive oil. The meal is basically a salad topped with a poached egg.

6713 2018-01-16 08:35:28 It’s where you massage oil into your skin to dissolve the existing oil on your face. It gets rid of makeup, impurities, grease and dirt in an effective but gentle way. If you use steam it’s even more effective as it opens up your pores!
6714 2018-01-16 08:35:18 Mix it with tree oil, apple cider vinegar and a cap of bottled water. It really does work!

6717 2018-01-16 08:34:56 #RajeOnRise Refinery was a necessity for Barmer because of the oil availability. The district deserves this. Thank you. @VasundharaBJP
6718 2018-01-16 08:34:49 The biggest advantage with the refinery is that it is being set up in the vicinity of its oil source.

6839 2018-01-16 08:12:51 No it really doesn't. Just drilling the oil, refining it, converting it to nurdles takes 4 times the energy to produce than paper. And most paper is a waste product of the timber industry.

6981 2018-01-16 07:43:24 Listen, when there is a lot of something it loses it's value. The reason oil is so valuable is because there is a finite amount. The reason Action comics is so valuable is not just because it's Superman's first appearance but also because they only printed so many. Understand ?
6982 2018-01-16 07:43:19 Men that smell of coconut oil is such a turn off. People in general that smell of coconut oil should not be out in public. I just can't

6990 2018-01-16 07:42:16 Yeah rUK will just go and get oil, gas, water, electricity, whisky and other products from elsewhere even though it would cost more. How the hell are you in such a responsible job when you have so little common sense ?

7125 2018-01-16 07:16:55 The Oil Change International analysis is actually quite conservative.  Their leakage estimates are at the low end of what activists believe.  The project would heavily damage both Oregon and the climate.  China installed more solar in 2017 than US to date. Not customer maybe?

More wax gives you better water resistance and greater garment wear…but also more stiffness. More linseed gives you the opposite.
7127 2018-01-16 07:16:50 Lesson from WW2. National security requires energy independence. Japan & Germany lacked oil which was one reason they lost. @realDonaldTrump is setting up  & offering to our friends  energy independence from the unpredictable current world suppliers.

An example of what a corrupt pool of judges could do: 

- The BP Gulf oil spill initially agreed upon $20B . BP shopped for judges to modify the settlement. It concluded w/ a $200M payment

- Welfare Reform was stripped of 8 provisions within 2 yrs

7427 2018-01-16 06:27:39 Is that select oil?
7428 2018-01-16 06:27:25 Hi!

That’s because SANCHI is was NOT carrying crude oil from Kharg Island, but was carrying gas condensates from Asaluyeh. This is a very explosive liquid and requires little refining into fuel as a result of it being considered a lighter oil on the API grade chart.

Thank you.

7552 2018-01-16 06:04:33 That’ll be like the deals negotiated with the oil companies. One only has to look at Norway to see how you are failing on a daily basis to represent Scotland. Time you started to work for all the Scots and not an elite few.

7558 2018-01-16 06:04:00 You are attacking a straw man. I didn't say Iraq could control prices on it's own, I said it could "vary supply and influence global oil prices", which it clearly did. You don't seem very interested in an honest debate, so HAND.
7559 2018-01-16 06:03:30 Using baking soda as a base, B4 makeup, will help.  Ingesting pro-biotics, coconut oil, yogurt, & apple cider vinegar may also help, esp if you have a yeast infection.

Best of all, get at least 8 hours of sleep per night, and in addition, practice meditation to relieve stress.

7569 2018-01-16 06:02:05 The part I really shake my head at is the PC gov, for the most part, couldn't even run a surplus when oil was over $100 barrel. Somehow the current gov should be able to do it with oil avg about $35 barrel.

7718 2018-01-16 05:37:32 Essential oil frequency varies directly with each organ & body part frequency, as like frequency of oil attracts a like body frequency.

Thanks honorable PM n CM
7819 2018-01-16 05:21:53 I don’t know where I’d be without my oil diffuser
7820 2018-01-16 05:21:40 It has currently made a huge investment in oil sector
7821 2018-01-16 05:21:37 I asked my hubby to oil my scalp during the KU game... he did ; however, I'm sure he skipped an entire section during the comback.
7822 2018-01-16 05:21:33 Is yuan based crude oil future launching on 18th Jan on INE , Shanghai ??? , Please confirm
7823 2018-01-16 05:21:27 オリーブ油は、毎朝やっているテレビ番組のコーナーでも使っていたりするよね♪
7824 2018-01-16 05:21:23 tea tree oil & witch hazel
7825 2018-01-16 05:21:20 this is me but when i eat smoked tuna, i don't give it to her bc it has like extra salt and oil in it and it's probably not good for her but i guess to cats it's all fish, which they are ultimately entitled to
7826 2018-01-16 05:21:18 the Andes , the Himalayas, the Appalachians, the Rockies, the Sierra Nevadas, etc. Lots of places have mountains with dammable spaces in between it's the water sources that are hard to come by. You'd have a lot of long pipes from the ocean. look at oil, long pipes aren't so hard.
7827 2018-01-16 05:21:13 Three spoons of oil is what I put across the crust to get that nice crispiness and seal it from the tomato sauce and gobs of cheese.
7828 2018-01-16 05:21:11  me too. Middle east can also leap ahead if they decide to focus on mining. Too much oil there but sadly they will rely on their oil wealth than crypto.
7829 2018-01-16 05:21:05 Yes, problems like a modern city of Caracas, tons of oil, beautiful seaside towns like Puerto La Cruz, rich farmland...and commie leaders.
7830 2018-01-16 05:20:53 Iraq's oil minister mentioned that the oil prices are expected to gain this year with global stockpiles falling and demand rising in China and India..
7831 2018-01-16 05:20:53 I won’t disagree with that. From what iv heard they didn’t even have barzal on the draft board. Slep is there only player out of the 1st round they drafted on the oil. Bear and jones might be there first sleeper picks in 20 years.
7832 2018-01-16 05:20:50 humans be like- *basic advanced primate function*

robots be like- “beeple bop where’s my oil”
7833 2018-01-16 05:20:46 Thought experiment: look at a map of propane or heating oil use per capita.  The high use spots are places where it's not economical to deliver natural gas (or hydrogen).
7834 2018-01-16 05:20:39 It's ridiculous how much better my skin looks after using Tarte's Maracuja oil every night
7835 2018-01-16 05:20:39 That feel when you realize you havent changed your oil since August
7836 2018-01-16 05:20:31 If you consume dairy, stop. Fish oil is not healthy, use a algae based dha. Take a b12.
7837 2018-01-16 05:20:27 Why are these evil people trying to guilt me out of pizza?

Also, where are my delicious spoons of warm oil?
7838 2018-01-16 05:20:18 Not quite as good as yours but the other day I lit a pan full of oil on fire by accident for the first time. That was quite the experience. Cooking, right? Hope your eyes are doing OK.
7839 2018-01-16 05:20:07 The disaster is considered the worst oil spill in decades, which Greenpeace says is posing a threat to “an important spawning ground” for fish and several whale species.
7840 2018-01-16 05:19:58 Something is fishy..also fishy how the Iranian oil Tanker crashed in South China Seas where Warships also roam from Coalition countries,just am opinion.
7841 2018-01-16 05:19:52 Y’all ever used baby oil while bussing them checks ?

7852 2018-01-16 05:18:34 Thats good! Honestly,,, the fact that oil seeped into the cardboard should be enough indication you can’t recycle it because oil cant be converted into cardboard??? >->;;;
7853 2018-01-16 05:18:32 Under the wing of the huge American power, oil majors pursue their profits. Above all, their philosophy is fundamentally different from ours.

7855 2018-01-16 05:18:19 Had pizza tonight so oil is well 
7856 2018-01-16 05:17:46 Honestly this just made me want to try swallowing 3 spoons of warm oil in case it might taste like pizza.
7857 2018-01-16 05:17:41 Bron gotta get some Jamaican castor oil , that shit works fast as fuck
7858 2018-01-16 05:17:22 They use the same oil they cook meat in to give it more flavor

7861 2018-01-16 05:17:00 You want facts I'm giving them. You said Norway was on bad terms with Russia I gave you the reason why. I added Afghanistan to illustrate Canada bought U.S. lie and still there protecting poppy fields and oil.
7862 2018-01-16 05:16:53 @CREDorg you’re spamming those awful ads. I don’t know who’s falling for this oil executive funded rhetoric. Fracking is immoral, without question
7863 2018-01-16 05:16:00 Physicists use the word "quantum" to mean something very specific.
Woo-spruikers use it in a hand-waving manner to mean "that science-y sounding stuff I don't understand but which saves me having to explain how my snake oil works".

7872 2018-01-16 05:14:54 PSA: My skin has always been red & blotchy & I get pimples & all that shit. Not to mention I get eczema on my eyelids. So I bought tea tree oil, and that shit is LIT. I put it on after washing my face & rub 3 drops in & now I don’t even feel like I HAVE to wear foundation.
7873 2018-01-16 05:14:49 @WholeFoods @amazon why did you change the formula of your fragrance free conditioner so that it no longer has argan oil? That’s the reason I bought it in the first place. @laurenlopaty and I are upset
7874 2018-01-16 05:14:47 Why his glasses look like penzoil high mileage vehicle motor oil with active cleansing agents.
7875 2018-01-16 05:14:42 I use parmesan cheese to absorb the oil.

7879 2018-01-16 05:13:59 I just used coconut oil to take my makeup off for the first time ever and...omg I will never use anything else

7881 2018-01-16 05:13:41 weaker Kenya Shilling is likely to see a stronger stock market as both are inversely correlated. Rising oil prices, a hawkish Fed and a voracious and ballooning appetite for foreign currency denominated debt are key risks to the Kenya Shilling.
7882 2018-01-16 05:13:31 It started our sunny while I was doing a brake job on my son's truck.  It got cloudy and cool as I got done. Then had to do an oil change on other truck and it was cool.

7889 2018-01-16 05:11:42 I'll eat ten slices of pizza if it means I don't have to drink warm oil.
7890 2018-01-16 05:11:38 Oil can be very very very hot guys. I just burnt my fingers.

7892 2018-01-16 05:11:30 Venezuela is in economic crisis, by Nov 2017 inflation increased by 4,000%, went from rich democracy to authoritarian dictatorship. 2/3 people don't have basic food, medicine, they're starving. THey need diversity, more modern economy, oil jobs like our coal going away.

7894 2018-01-16 05:11:14 an essential oil but for my constant need of approval
7895 2018-01-16 05:11:13 The disaster is considered the worst oil spill in decades, which Greenpeace says is posing a threat to “an important spawning ground” for fish and several whale species.
7896 2018-01-16 05:11:08 Is that motor oil?  If so, the answer is still probably yes.  I'm all in if it is olive oil, vegetable oil, bacon grease or shortening.
7897 2018-01-16 05:11:03 As long as @ryan_wgr is in and there’s an oil spill between then and now. It’s the only way it’d feel right
7898 2018-01-16 05:10:56 I still think that 5 11,600 gallon oil tank trucks filled with syrup would be enough

7906 2018-01-16 05:10:09 I already don’t wanna get up to take my car to get the oil changed in the morning
7907 2018-01-16 05:10:02 True. It’s just frustrating when oil fans complain about shit with three years hindsight and not a fully thought out idea.

7909 2018-01-16 05:09:47 Yes... I'd rather order 36 spoons just so we have enough... You need emergency spoons of oil.

7920 2018-01-16 05:08:10 Years ago, a magazine article said using a canister vacuum was like pulling a pig around by a leash. From that day forward, in our house the vacuum cleaner was called “the pig.”  From this day forward, we will refer to ordering pizza as “shipping in some warm oil.”

7923 2018-01-16 05:07:25 McCarthy has no problem with oil drilling off the California coast, then.

7925 2018-01-16 05:07:12 Best meal plan -if anyone doesn't know where to start: Big bowl of Green Salads with 1 piece of grass fed meat and some coconut oil or ghee.
7926 2018-01-16 05:07:07 You mean you are making us safe?  Like when you put a target on 5000 of our troops in Iraq by saying they should steal oil?  Or when we lost the best fighters of ISIS by putting those helping us on the travel ban which ended in 4 Seals dying?

7931 2018-01-16 05:06:42 Woah. That’s cool. I’ll have to look more into it. Do you think they have an essential oil from it?
7932 2018-01-16 05:06:37 Big bottle of Canola oil and small bottle of olive oil in the pantry. Yes, olive does have a different flavour - one that adds to some recipes and detracts from others.

Just 'dislike'?
Funny: the US never got one drop of oil from Iraq. Not a single US company was given an oil concession by the new Iraqi government.
7941 2018-01-16 05:05:50 If that oil tastes as good as the pizza, then bring it on!

7942 2018-01-16 05:05:48 Sell it to Oil of Olay or TeenVogue?

7949 2018-01-16 05:04:50 He's given me an idea: Let's spread around lots of pot and hash oil among the Palestinians. I'm pretty sure if they mellowed out we'd have a better chance of getting to a peace deal with them without having to commit national suicide.
7950 2018-01-16 05:04:49 I will think of you every time the airlines and banks screw me. I will think of you as I sip my dirty water and look out into the ocean with oil lapping at my feet. #ThanksForNothing

8046 2018-01-16 04:52:59 Try to grind canned chickpeas, form them into balls, deep-fry them, they completely fall apart in the oil. The common solution for this type of recipe is to add some extra starch in the form of flour. Flour-bound falafel certainly holds together,you end up with dense, pasty balls

8048 2018-01-16 04:52:32 My black kitten's eyes are super bright and their coats are very soft. I attribute this to the fish oil. They're doing great and enjoying a long kittenhood that many other strays can't get. I'm very glad I kept them together. They are great pets.

8109 2018-01-16 04:44:10 Use savings toward development of Tidal, Wind, Solar
Unspoken cost of oil is destruction of water & food production
Oil leaks & pollutes
China banned oil usage
Because will die from pollution if they fail
Clean energy
Asthma & obesity is now biggest threat in China
8110 2018-01-16 04:44:06 I love my Dad so much. I needed a last min oil change and a lightbulb replaced and he went out sick as a dog and did it for me without asking 
8111 2018-01-16 04:43:58 Time to slather myself in tea tree oil :)
8112 2018-01-16 04:43:40 it's like "thanks for the information, i am going to eat all eight slices of this pizza now thanks." also are these tablespoons or teaspoons? because i mean, i need to know how much oil i should drink instead

8114 2018-01-16 04:43:25 The second gulf war was pretty much that. Oh, and the US wanted control over the oil....
8115 2018-01-16 04:43:16 This is why when homes are converted from oil to gas the old tank  fill and vent piping should be removed or at the very least capped off.

8123 2018-01-16 04:42:07 I read the article looking for what Trump did wrong. Since this was a policy negotiation, he merely let it be known, he would not submit to CBC ‘demands’.  Durbin came to strong arm the Pres. to get everything Dems wanted, knowing he’d say no then Dicky screamed racist! Setup?

8134 2018-01-16 04:40:25 Russia is not buying shithole bonds.  Somehow they figured out they are best served to pump out all the oil they can and swap for yuans, and then gold.  Gold instead of US bonds.  This is not rocket science.

8139 2018-01-16 04:39:50 I do that once a week (it’s really strong for my face ) then the next day I’ll apply an egg to my face and let that dry . But between cocoa butter , cocoa nut oil, and a st Ives avocado scrub . Keeps my skin healthy & lots of water .

8141 2018-01-16 04:39:25 @CNN became bigtime because they were able to report 24 hours a day on the first policing action in Iraq over oil. That was a new thing for Americans. Since then they have been the arm and tool of the skanky left.
8142 2018-01-16 04:39:24 If you don't slice the pie there is no oil
8143 2018-01-16 04:39:20 much of the inflation was about shortage. it was not just oil, but we lived through an era of so many items just not available. a normal market would had self corrected by investing in new companies to fill in the gap. they did not because there was little benefit to them.
8144 2018-01-16 04:39:14 every time i apply peppermint oil topically i manage to get it in my eye and it burns SO BADLY that i vow to never ever use it again but wow look at that back on my bullshit

8148 2018-01-16 04:38:41 Draw out as much chain as possible. Then you can soak it in Varsol or gasoline to clean it and then give it a fresh coat of oil.
8149 2018-01-16 04:38:22 I kinda feel like three spoons of warm oil now tbh.
8150 2018-01-16 04:38:16 Moisturizing In coconut oil is one of my favorite things in life
8151 2018-01-16 04:38:13 Are you studied on the subject? It is not oil & water if you look deeper. You do things the Bible says not to, yet y’all harp on this. It’s absurd and it is cruel even if you don’t understand that it’s cruel.

8157 2018-01-16 04:37:26 I would definitely drink a cup of warm olive oil
8158 2018-01-16 04:37:14 I can understand #BlueJays fans not being thrilled w/ Granderson  but worth taking flyer on at said price. Certainly gives them more options.
8159 2018-01-16 04:37:00 Look, if you infuse the oil with roasted garlic and give me some good bread, it's at least a debate.
8160 2018-01-16 04:36:51 Lol by Man City pre oil money standards he is definitely a legend. He was even a skipper at some point.
8161 2018-01-16 04:36:49 No no all white people are same. Just a few support him covertly, and a majority support openly. Only those political folks who lost their bread and butter due to his election hate him.
8162 2018-01-16 04:36:48 I saw you ask on The5, ask “what does it take to get fired?” We had a rookie FF burn down a fire station leaving hot oil on stove, and nothing happened #whatdoesittake

8164 2018-01-16 04:36:17 yeah so no one told me that it's not safe to put peppermint oil directly on your skin so here's your PSA that you shouldn't do that
8165 2018-01-16 04:35:49 The people who say this shit have clearly never experienced the glory of good bread dipped in good olive oil. Also, what do they think salad dressing is?
8166 2018-01-16 04:35:49 smear the walls with coconut oil
8167 2018-01-16 04:35:46 Plus, the tweet has a picture of pepperoni pizza, but the words don't say if those spoons of oil are for plain or pepperoni. And where does pineapple fit in?

8183 2018-01-16 04:33:35 Lot of follow up questions tho, I.e., is a “spoon” of oil a different measure than spoonful? Does it have to be warm and does that impact caloric value? What kind of oil (motor? Olive? Grapeseed ?)? Etc.

8190 2018-01-16 04:33:03 because it takes time to close up the kitchen, clean out the oil bin, prepare food for tomorrow, sweep and mop the floors, dump the coffee and set out the grounds for the next day, and still get off in time to make it to your next job if you have one??? Dude you’re out of line.
8191 2018-01-16 04:33:03 They just make it up. If we were to do similar we’d be in front of a jury for slander and libel.

8193 2018-01-16 04:32:40 Lol. Climate change happens every 100,000 to 500,000 years or so. Like clockwork. That climate rotation will continue regardless of human involvement. We will still rely on oil & fossil fuels for at least the next few generations.  Such is life.

8200 2018-01-16 04:31:24 I bought an essential oil diffuser and I am IN LOVE.
8201 2018-01-16 04:31:14 I had my previous car from September 2009 to January 2017. Only reason I traded her in was the engine was leaking too much oil. I wanted to drive that car until it hit 300K miles. Only made it to 218K. ( ._.)
8202 2018-01-16 04:30:26 Picked up some new essential oils for my aromatherapy. I decided to go for the eucalyptus calm oil but then added some lemongrass purify oil and went with lavender de-stress last minute so now my room smells like a witch’s lair and its wonderful

8228 2018-01-16 04:26:16 I know that's right with that coconut oil all over your body 
8229 2018-01-16 04:25:56 You are beautiful just the way you are. After a dermatologist visit, creams, and chemical peels....The best remedy for me was a pure sulfur bar of soap and coconut oil or shea butter as a natural moisturizer remedy.
8230 2018-01-16 04:25:53 Who cares. He keeps polish people as slaves, they only get 4 dollars an hour. I would give them 100 dollars an hour if I had the money. He even put stupid oil drills in the ocean.
8231 2018-01-16 04:25:51 My mind is racing. I don’t have enough lavender oil for this 
8232 2018-01-16 04:25:28 Liberty, You are kidding yourself. Every child knows their actions have repercussions. It is simple, American interests want their oil profits. Our country hired propaganda machines to sell the wars & taxpayers paid for the propaganda.  Russia? You are the Trump supporter, not me
8233 2018-01-16 04:25:18 So what did I do? Made a sugar scrub with sugar and coconut oil...and exfoliated.

8237 2018-01-16 04:24:41 So much snake oil
8238 2018-01-16 04:24:37 Lay in a completely dark room with complete silence. If you’re okay with the smell, put peppermint oil/lotion on your temples. Take three Advil, drink lots of water, and then in two hours take 2 Tylenol if it isn’t better yet. (I have chronic migraines, I get them all the time)
8239 2018-01-16 04:24:27 YES

8247 2018-01-16 04:22:51 I experience this a lot too & not a lot of people talk about it!! I use a bit of peppermint oil & I inhale for a count of 6, hold for 6 & exhale for 6 (then I repeat for 5, 4, 3, 2, & 1). This is the only method that has helped me with the nausea ... I hope this helps you too!!!

8251 2018-01-16 04:22:40 LMAO if it wasn't for @vane_baby143 to tell me to get my car in for an oil change, my car would be broken by then!

8262 2018-01-16 04:21:06 //battery resource mining is a concern of course; especially lithium, since its relatively scarce and I can see it becoming the 21st century’s future ‘oil shock’ resource. 

I believe we can exist harmoniously with the natural world, maintaining an equilibrium. We choose not to.
8263 2018-01-16 04:21:05 @dpradhanbjp The govt’s greed for tax rupees gets bigger by the day. This govt never passed on the benefits of low oil prices to the customers but chose to continuously satiate its hunger for more revenues. People are aware how the govt machinery leaks to to fund the undeserving.

8267 2018-01-16 04:20:45 I’ve heard about glycerin. Haven’t used it myself yet. But tbh honey and olive oil also my faves. I’ve just added that to my little mist spray.

8276 2018-01-16 04:19:10 -- Slammed a whole bottle of nyquil in one go. The second day missed is even worse...and so on. The withdrawals from it, even when taken correctly, are crippling. Once weed is legal tho I wanna come off of it and use cannabis oil as a replacement. I have hope.

8289 2018-01-16 04:17:36 When global oil prices crashed, Govt milked common men by increasing Central excise on oil and states hiked VAT. How about rolling back the hike in excise and VAT,  now that crude prices are so high. Why not put Petrol, diesel under GST. @narendramodi

8298 2018-01-16 04:16:11 oh,  i dont fuck with an oil thermometer,  and teabh i didnt know that was a thing.  i let it heat up for a couple minutes and give each side 3 minutes  and they came out perfectly

8300 2018-01-16 04:16:07 TIL that people put coconut oil once their coffee instead of creamer because it has less fat
8301 2018-01-16 04:16:02 Furnace? (We bought a place with a heat pump and oil back up when temp is below 0 celsius. Thought the house was burning down the first time it kicked in.)

8307 2018-01-16 04:14:47 Still beat us in burning oil
8308 2018-01-16 04:14:37 I thought I read analysis somewhere that CO2 used for oil extraction was still a net carbon benefit?

8316 2018-01-16 04:12:49 Just earlier, I applied oil onto my sword so it has great sharpness. If you touch it even slightly, your fingers would be cut and blood could spill.
8317 2018-01-16 04:12:17 Makes me want it more TBH. Oil keeps things in good condition.
8318 2018-01-16 04:12:11 I’ll keep on my fish oil tablets, soon to be algae once fish oil is gone. Thanks for answer, that’s about what I’ve heard via Dr Greger’s podcast.

8323 2018-01-16 04:11:39 Please Thom. Rediscover your skepticism. You're better than to associate yourself with such a snake oil salesman as Eichenwald.
8324 2018-01-16 04:11:39 But it's a healthy oil, like coconut, right?
8325 2018-01-16 04:11:18 my dad just wrote a grunt from it. yeah is oil scsi longest like actually 30 plays. there is another guy at politics even. my parents share some jobs. i thought it was a haiku.
8326 2018-01-16 04:11:11 Parfum is more oil based so the scent lasts longer than toilette.

8335 2018-01-16 04:10:34 Obviously for those whose only concern is "oil", loss of human lives doesn't matter. Like the 500,000 people they got killed in Iraq based on WMD lies.

8339 2018-01-16 04:09:49 Since I’ve been working in the oil patch it’s been very good to me but I just get very lonely at times, I really need a boo tbh that’s gonna comfort me, love me, Massage me after a long day at work. I would appreciate it

8344 2018-01-16 04:08:26 Maybe it's because the Palm Oil industry is largely based on deforestation, forced labor, and slave labor?
8345 2018-01-16 04:08:00 Can i get mine with 3 extra scoops of oil please?
8346 2018-01-16 04:07:48 I’m trying edibles and vape now. But edibles just give u a body high. I usually cook with canabbis oil. Make myself get smacked off rice and beans and chuleta

8350 2018-01-16 04:06:52 As we know it’s winter time and we don’t want our hair out in the frigid air. Best thing for any protective style that you have is to keep your scalp oiled. Just like our skin gets dry, so does our scalp. Try to oil your scalp with a mix of light/heavy oils for best results!!
8351 2018-01-16 04:06:31 Every night I go to bed smelling like bacon grease (castor oil) with hopes that I’ll wake up with a Repunzel beard.
8352 2018-01-16 04:06:16 try it! and use butter instead of oil. it taste better

8354 2018-01-16 04:05:54 What about half crude oil prices
What about low global commodity prices
If Modi could have channelized a little towards farmers, I would be agreeing with you.
But, now, I don't.
8355 2018-01-16 04:05:49 Also as if I'd make a roux with oil instead of narcissus.
8356 2018-01-16 04:05:46 This assumes I have a problem with eating oil...
8357 2018-01-16 04:05:00 Officially adding prepoo with coconut oil to my hair washing routine. Definitely made hair easier to manage. The tension method made blow drying much easier too.
8358 2018-01-16 04:04:50 Brotip: Hair is more fragile in winter. Because it is more dry. You may feel that blowdrying will help because warm. WRONG. Heat on dry, frail hair is awful for it. Do that as little as humanly possible. Condition it. Use heat protecting spray/oil. Use a towel. Stay golden.
8359 2018-01-16 04:04:37 I'm pleased Oil will keep Profits high by taking control of Solar and maintaining costs to ensure we don't go backwards.
8360 2018-01-16 04:04:36 Ah "soft Hindutva" of Khangress... where PFI is free to hold gatherings while they cook us Hindus in boiling oil...Sounds wonderful....
8361 2018-01-16 04:04:34 He’s telling retail investors to backoff, so that the big oil can buy them cheap
8362 2018-01-16 04:04:20 Today someone told me to drink some essential oil to help with my GI problems. I had to be careful to not laugh at her because 1- She's a lovely person and I like her (MLMs notwithstanding) and 2- I was on the top rung of a wiggly ladder.
8363 2018-01-16 04:04:17 Interesting. My body is responding really well to the foundation I use and rosehip oil so I feel like that might help the root of my hormonal stuff now that's great that it worked for you!

8366 2018-01-16 04:04:01 Oil is not really a competitor here as almost no electricity is produced with oil. Wind generated electricity is quite old. Solar and nuclear are the “new” kids in town (1950s). However, nuclear has captured a much larger market share.
8367 2018-01-16 04:03:53 Feeling inspired by @doterra! I’m always learning new things an oil can help or heal! Can’t wait to continue this journey!
8368 2018-01-16 04:03:50 Reshaping political reality in the bad ways. He's: alienating allies. Emboldening authoritarian dictators and neo-Nazis. A pathological liar. Filled his admin with big banks/oil/special interests that gutted the middle class. Supported econ plans that have crushed the mid class.
8369 2018-01-16 04:03:40 Also buy peanut butter or something for times like this? Almonds? Coconut? Fish oil?

8382 2018-01-16 04:02:32 I beleive still there is a scope to continue with same excise and vat. Still prices haven't crossed at the highest level of last 8 years. Crude oil rate is at $70 a barrel. Can't see any change till $100 a barrel and Rs. 78 a litre(Delhi price) for petrol.

8391 2018-01-16 04:01:05 And adding CBD oil into the mix. I feel you, that's a great plan David. Glad I tuned in for a little while tonight btw
8392 2018-01-16 04:00:47 Jersey sheets, a big T-shirt, and lavender oil are the only thing a girl needs to have a peaceful night 
8393 2018-01-16 04:00:42 Maybe you need to add Stop exporting our oil.  Process it for our use instead of selling it to foreign countries.  I bet you can follow the lined pockets in DC

8400 2018-01-16 03:58:57 Price will go up if you do not act against climate change. We know Trump is all about doing the opposite. Republican equals oil and arms. So the  can benefit from Democrats. Republicans are humans, but they are driven by oil, guns, and so on. They are into it too deep.

8409 2018-01-16 03:57:18 Actually I googled it cause you got me curious, they are filled with pus, dead skin cells, dirt and oil. The reason they become cycsts is because the infection happens deeper in the skin than regular acne, so it forms a large bump rather than a little pimple

8412 2018-01-16 03:56:54 This happens every year and they continue to get it together the second half and lebron becomes some kind of robot and his teammates just provide the oil to keep him running they will be fine

8414 2018-01-16 03:56:49 I’ve fallen in love with coconut oil as a moisturizer. Smells good and kills the winter itch. Wonder how it works as a lube.

8415 2018-01-16 03:56:44 Couple weeks back there Fancies started looking bad. 

I had kept waiting for Vegas to fall but it showed Kings were more likely too.

8419 2018-01-16 03:56:00 This is an excellent question  and does swallowing cold oil have a different effect?
8420 2018-01-16 03:55:42 Sort of. CAC/DCC policy in CoV, Burnaby gets close, but auctioning zoning per se haven't seen. But it's how governments sell stuff they know the market knows the value of, but gov't doesn't know value -- spectrum, oil rights, etc. Some reasons to modify current approach: 1

8425 2018-01-16 03:55:14 body butter from the body shop !!! that shit is my go no matter what. I also use tea tree oil to lessen the swelling
8426 2018-01-16 03:55:07 Surely foreign policy is more complicated than dosti-dushmani? Whether we like it or not, we need oil. Israel also wants to be China's friend. Not sure it'll be so forthcoming in an indo-chinese conflict. Then there's also the Iran angle.
8427 2018-01-16 03:55:05 Imagine soaking in oil then lotioning up and getting ready to “chill” with the trade of your choice for the night....and then BOOM they either cancel or you dont hear back from them for the night.
8428 2018-01-16 03:54:51 Do you mean that the oil slick on the surface is spreading?
8429 2018-01-16 03:54:26 im legitimately wondering if eating spoonfuls of warm oil is supposed to turn me off.

and if it is, it isn't working.

8432 2018-01-16 03:53:59 Norway exports 100% of their oil and invests the $$$ in renewable energy sources.  Trump would still spit!
8433 2018-01-16 03:53:53 We shouldn’t forget the huge head start that oil and gas has gotten from the flow through shares and accelerated CCA.

He will ruin us with his ignorance and selfishness. It's disgusting & heartbreaking for this nation.

8445 2018-01-16 03:53:07 Yay thank you sweetness! My daddy and I are going to a store tomorrow where they sell the oil as an additive to vape juice. I can't wait to try and I'll report back!
8446 2018-01-16 03:53:04 Okay okay okay, I have 11 candles lit and my oil diffuser going and my salt lamp on and my best headphones. I'm finally ready to listen to the entirety of the new @rustyclanton album. I'm so fucking happy right now.

8452 2018-01-16 03:52:11 Fine.  Norway.  Huge, cold, petrostate.  Still under 10 ghg/person.  And interprovincial transport is a tiny part of our GHGs.  Heck, Alberta alone is 38% of Canada's emissions despite being 10% of the population.  Why?  Dirty oil and dirty coal power.

8455 2018-01-16 03:51:56 The alarm was a simple Emergency Response Program that every oil company in North America must have and know how to use. A US state should have enough professionals to use one without the Feds having to hold their hand

8457 2018-01-16 03:51:32 That's why people that can't shoot shouldn't hunt. Cleanly killed game kill is the only kind. All life feels pain. Even the earth, from fracking and oil drilling and such. I'm no scientist, but my common sense tells me that.

8464 2018-01-16 03:50:11 Does all argon oil smell like cheese? Cus I Just bought some for my skin and I want to throw up
8465 2018-01-16 03:50:07 That’s happened to me in the past. Diesel Fuel will work to replace oil temporarily. It’s not good to use for a long period of time like you can with oil, but it’ll work for emergencies.
8466 2018-01-16 03:49:54 Your thinking that, BC ACTUALLY cares about its targets!  Oil and Gas emissions have been removed from BC's Clean Energy Act!
8467 2018-01-16 03:49:48 For some reason, my #NintendoSwitch decided that it won't let #SuperMarioOdyssey snapshots with the oil painting filter post to Twitter anymore.
8468 2018-01-16 03:49:42 Sir crude keep on the depreciating trend where as oil prices in india keep on soaring , a year back when crude was all time low, excise was enhanced to a all time high , oil prices again moving ahead post the Gujarat polls.
8469 2018-01-16 03:49:37 I feel for them, but I’d put them in the same category as oil or coal workers in the sense that this is a necessary loss for he sake of a better tomorrow.
8470 2018-01-16 03:49:33 I wish I had pictures from the early 80's. We worked some Redwood burl that had a bunch of copper and chrome in the soil, ir produced blood red birdseye with a silver background. It looked really nice in tung oil
8471 2018-01-16 03:49:30 So why do y’all basically own Haiti? Why did @ChelseaClinton get a wedding paid for by donations for Haiti? Rice in Haiti?? Good?? Oil?? 

Btw you do realize that no one believes any Clinton anymore!! 

Y’all should be in prison!

8472 2018-01-16 03:49:27 They also rate higher in election security and voter confidence using paper ballots.

They also collect oil revenues in a national pension savings account that's well over $1trillion.

They got rid of their Trump, his name was Quisling.

It's the lutefisk.
8473 2018-01-16 03:49:25 Yeah the bug spray in the early 2000s and then the oil a few years back. Even the cinnamon challenge was stupid. I never got it.

8480 2018-01-16 03:48:37 Yeah I need to find a way to get these bunped on my timeline, so I can get down there again. If they let me back in after the Thanskgiving runaway we had. 
I know they secretly want me to cme on the show, but my publicist says they are still too edgy & controversial.

8484 2018-01-16 03:47:45 I have been using coconut oil and I like it.
8485 2018-01-16 03:47:31 I am a god damn fastidious motherfucker who replaces his drain plug with a German made one every few oil changes, along with a new copper gasket.

Because the plugs are like a few bucks a pop, the gaskets are like a dime. 

A new magnesium oil pan?... a lot more.
8486 2018-01-16 03:47:09 Feeling like God has given me the eggs, batter, oil, water, greased the pan, and even preheated the stove for me.. He’s patiently waiting for me to bake this cake and enjoy the first bite!  #ReapingTheBenefits #HisTimingIsEverything

8489 2018-01-16 03:47:01 What astonishes me is that there are people who believe in the Bible and also believe that homosexuality is okay. If you believe homosexuality is okay then logically you should not be a Bible believer. But you can't have both. Oil and water.
8490 2018-01-16 03:46:58 Had Romney won in 2012. We would not be as far as we are. He's in the Koch's or even Russia's pockets, on oil. Romney was 1000% fossil fuel policy. That would have killed it here. GOP are pushing the boundaries by offshoring oil drilling. It's fucking crazy but that's the agenda.
8491 2018-01-16 03:46:43 Omg, thank you ! I’ve been so fed up seeing the owner blast the gvmt for his closure !!! And no one in the media seems to be questioning his declarations ! His business model might have been viable with oil highs and people willing to blow cash. No more ! + 0 online presence !
8492 2018-01-16 03:46:39 Coconut oil is my rub down oil of choice
8493 2018-01-16 03:46:20 7 years ago an oil Derrick fire in the Gulf of Mexico spilled  over 1M gallons of oil, killed off the gulf's shrimp, putting thousands of shrimpers on unemployment. It fouled beaches from FL to TX, destroying #tourism those states need.
Obama instituted safety rules.

8562 2018-01-16 03:37:39 Oil and gas exploration is subsidized. We’re paying for their destruction of habitat for subsistence herds and endangered species, and their poisoning of the ocean, and then we pay for the gas, too. Hope you live in Florida. You’ll be underwater first with Mar-A-Luggie.
8563 2018-01-16 03:37:29 I saw something on the news about this a few days ago, that's very worrying for sure. So we got North Korea cyber attacking hospitals to gain funds, Russia going after cable lines, and China selling oil to North Korea amid sanctions.  Sounds like we are on the brink of war, smh.

8571 2018-01-16 03:36:27 Really?! That’s crazy. Like before when I was just using regular lotion and stuff it didn’t help. The serum and coconut oil. Are the two things that really helped
8572 2018-01-16 03:36:21 A splash, possibly too much really. Oil and salt are the most important..I just had the cream to use up and my brain went into mashed potato mode.

The shame.

8647 2018-01-16 03:26:17 I hear Tea Tree oil helps

8656 2018-01-16 03:24:54 True, I'd say the utilities side of things probably closer to downstream/petchems than the upstream that's driven a lot of growth over the last decade - plus non-dispatchables probably create idiosyncratic risks that might be a difficult fit for big oil
8657 2018-01-16 03:24:51 Yeah! I did order that Marilyn hot oil treatment! I used the Damaged hot oil treatment and I like it a lot 
8658 2018-01-16 03:24:50 Most of this stuff is snake oil. I have tried many different kinds of oils that claim to be CBD oil. The best stuff has trace amounts of THC. Not enough to show up on a drug test even if you took 100X the dose. CBD oil does work but not all that shines is gold.

8669 2018-01-16 03:23:08 I’ve spent hours studying this very issue. America does not fight religious wars. That said, imo, the only thing that can stave off losing the dollar reserve currency is energy. Oil, Nat Gas, Coal, Solar etc. If America develops it’s energy resources look out

8705 2018-01-16 03:17:27 I feel like the oil rig tanker collision is just as bad as the bp spill. It’s fucked up
8706 2018-01-16 03:17:21 I was taught by chefs to stab 'em in the head with a chefs knife first. Makes a satisfying crunching sound too ;)
8707 2018-01-16 03:17:13 Ladies. Put down the sodas and drink water. Stop smoking blacks and cigarettes and smoke good. Take care of your real nails under your fake nails. Eat a balanced diet. Stay active. Use coconut oil for an everyday moisturizer for EVERYTHING (hair, lips/face, and body) 
8708 2018-01-16 03:16:55 No I would rather consume 6 spoons of warm oil...
8709 2018-01-16 03:15:58 Ever since i started using this lavender oil body wash i always get even more relaxed and sleepy after I shower
8710 2018-01-16 03:15:55 The morracon oil hydrating mask
8711 2018-01-16 03:15:54 yup! Just no oil. Although I was reading the book and it did say you can spray it with olive oil. That’s what I did to the potato wedges

8725 2018-01-16 03:13:40 Perhaps your district voters would appreciate if you expand your website environment section to not only answer if you believe in climate change but your stand on offshore ocean drilling (as stating you want to preserve national habitat does not preclude an oil rig in middle :)

8727 2018-01-16 03:13:33 Besides if @Litolman is right, if you invest on Shell or any blue chips company, would you have the control to the day to day activity of the corporation? No, diba. What do we know about running an oil and gas company. We just put our money in and wait for the dividend.
8728 2018-01-16 03:13:28 And yet you're saying we shouldn't invest in infrastructure until we've run out, which doesn't make sense since we'd have to resort to an undeveloped technology if we just drop it right now and wait until we're out of oil. That makes no sense.

8736 2018-01-16 03:12:29 FWIW, I said so at the time. All wars are economic. Not embarrassed to say so either. As I recall war with Japan was economic.  Oil is the life blood of capitalism. It is just the way it is. Maybe some day it will not be so. Which is why drill baby drill.

8828 2018-01-16 03:00:22 I'd wait a day or 2 after shaving as shaving already makes the skin sensitive so you don't want to irritate it more by exfoliating which invariably leads to more oil production... so yea a day or 2
8829 2018-01-16 03:00:19 Someone captured the image of Rob and Toca Madera girl making out, right? I'd prefer tasteful oil on black velvet but I'll accept a grainy Snapchat video if it will make Scheana stop the nasal whining. #PumpRules

Shell Oil will now be less reliant it's oil production. 
What lovely irony.
8899 2018-01-16 02:49:27 That won't happen. Trump is increasing oil production and has completed several trade deals with China. Trudeau has completed none...We need them more than they need us...whether you want to admit it or not.

8978 2018-01-16 02:39:32 They say it like it's a problem! Obviously not from an olive oil producing nation - or they've never had decent olive oil before. (And I say this as an occasional oil drinker.)

8984 2018-01-16 02:38:52 Is it a faux pas to apply some lavender essential oil if your airplane seat neighbor smells like weed/blunt and body odor?
8985 2018-01-16 02:38:47 Guess you could ask them why they keep paying benefits to these ppl that could get those jobs

9002 2018-01-16 02:35:16 Well wok's are nice cause you can fry stuff in them and braise stuff in sauce at the bottom. I've found when it comes to frying food that getting creative with your oil has a huge effect on the overall flavor tho so that's my tip!!'

9012 2018-01-16 02:33:35 Impeach Trump and his entire cabinet!!! He is turning our allies against us and threatening wars that should never happen. A major war would cripple our nation to say the least. And, these adversaries are not 3rd world countries. They would attack U.S. soil. No more blood for oil

9020 2018-01-16 02:31:31 The #0tech approach renders the ability of corrupt consultants to burden you with their snake oil ineffective.

Getting saddled with infrastructure and integration work up front will make sure they are there for a long time until you are out of money and options.
9021 2018-01-16 02:31:28 If Trudeau needs more tax $ he should think about opening up the pipes and letting our oil flow to the coast. Not just talk, we’d like to see some action.

9023 2018-01-16 02:31:19 Yeah, but c'mon, I'm not made of money. They were expensive & the crotch ripped to shit in like less than a couple weeks. The skirt served its purpose. Actually, I regret throwing it out, but it was getting pretty grungy from chain oil & stuff

9044 2018-01-16 02:28:50 I owe 40% of my anxiety improvement to this $20 oil diffuser. I pop a few drops of lavender oil in it every night and sleep like a baby instead of staying up overthinking 
9045 2018-01-16 02:28:38 I'd rather be burned alive in hot oil than view that lying shithole give a speech.  A speech written by Stephen Miller, who once said he was glad the white man killed all the Indians, otherwise we'd all still be finger painting.
9046 2018-01-16 02:28:20 Germany’s coal plants send a lot of air pollution into neighboring France, which has a very low-carbon grid because most of their energy is generated by...nuclear plants.

9055 2018-01-16 02:27:27 Not to sound stupid, but did you have brand new packing boxes or used? I ask because the caustic agent is oil, & adheres to things, that's how it spreads most & onto us, it's a form of 'sticky' if there were used boxes it could have transferred from one of them. Just a thought
9056 2018-01-16 02:27:14 It smells like clove oil in the warehouse

9080 2018-01-16 02:24:23 Oil painting is spreading.
9081 2018-01-16 02:24:19 This is the oil money talking... Part of the contract probably forces you to tweet gatbage like this
9082 2018-01-16 02:24:03 Let me find out who tf this hoe. I have gas money & just got an oil change. I can make it to NE in a day lol
9083 2018-01-16 02:23:49 it was backed by gold and silver at one. point now it's guns and oil. China and Russia have offered the same and have a place the Petro economy that is no longer USD exclusive. Venezuela has their own thing that will fail.
9084 2018-01-16 02:23:47 I would drink 3 spoons of olive oil over pizza. <3

9088 2018-01-16 02:23:10 Non sequitur. 

I am not disputing your statement of fact. 

I welcome you to address directly the substance of my previous statement. To the extent gold can now be had for RMB, the game has materially changed as regards a yuan/oil contract.

9092 2018-01-16 02:22:34 And once upon a time.... dr Morton was the minister responsible for the oil patch.

(His confusion of issues... in a industry he was responsible for ..... scares the bejezus out of me)
9093 2018-01-16 02:22:31 getting a Woodwick Oil Diffuser for my room was quite possibly the smartest purchase ive made in some time ...
9094 2018-01-16 02:22:26 The contract isn't a yuan/gold/oil contract. Its an oil contract. producers sell oil for yuan which they can then put into a gold contract which is for deliverable gold. For certain countries this is advantageous (Russia, Iran etc) to avoid $. Its a crack in the petrodollar.JM2cs

9096 2018-01-16 02:22:12 I always make a mix of lentils, chickpeas, with olive oil, lemon, and parsley. It works great to eat alone or throw it on a salad, eat it with an avocado, put it on top of a sweet potato, mix it with roasted veggies. Possibilities are endless!
9097 2018-01-16 02:22:01 Well have to see how that turns out. I know bush stopped China from purchasing the largest oil company in the world... I don't know about a car company if legally he could stop it. The oil argument was made on national security oil for our military equipment.
9098 2018-01-16 02:21:49 With so much oil reserves available via fracking, there’s no need to open these reserves.   The motivation seeems purely political.

9103 2018-01-16 02:20:52 burn that MIDNIGHT OIL.. BABY!!!
9104 2018-01-16 02:20:25 What about oil producers who have big trade with China? Wouldn't selling some of their oil in Yuan be a viable option?
9105 2018-01-16 02:20:20 But the Haitians are protesting @BillClinton  offices wanting to know WHERE THE MONEY WENT. Why did Hillary Rodham Clinton BROTHER get control of gold mine? Friends of Bill hv contracts for oil?
9106 2018-01-16 02:20:11 everytime i burp i smell truffle oil
9107 2018-01-16 02:20:10 I use my knowledge as a herbalist to judge the quality and potency of the plant based on when it was harvested and what part is being used, this determines what the herb to oil ratio should be and then the amount of salve used depends on a person's weight and metabolism.
9108 2018-01-16 02:19:50 Can we get some makeup people to do some oil blotting???  #TheBachelor
9109 2018-01-16 02:19:48 There is no gold based oil contract..it is simply an oil contract traded in YUAN

2 - Oil was Iranian not Syrian
3 - Cargo is always insured, otherwise it won't even leave the port (if you know anything at all you should know this) 
4 - Cargo was intended for North Korea (no ties with Syria)

9121 2018-01-16 02:17:42 I became like Ahab, obsessed with the whale in my sea
Until I can get the whale out of my memory
Am haunted by the whale so ahead of me
This whale he tipped me over and I was lost at sea
Then he swam away and put all the blame on me
Now I feel like blubber
Oil to his lamp

9124 2018-01-16 02:17:29 True. However, one important thing has changed: there are now robust physical gold markets in Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Dubai -- all three of which will sell a buyer physical gold bullion in exchange for RMB. If the "3rd time's a charm" for a yuan/oil contract, that will be why.

9153 2018-01-16 02:12:49 Where do u get that he supports foreign oil? Maybe he just thinks that his state's tourism which supplies a hell of a lot more jobs and businesses should come before the oil and gas SWAMP that Trump is swimming in. Same for Florida.
9154 2018-01-16 02:12:42 Niggas had cookies on a plate so I slick grabbed one & no one said shit even when they saw me eat it & they cooked it good cuz I ain’t taste no weed oil taste now I’m getting that body high smh

9156 2018-01-16 02:12:31 Fr Fr and it’s a Dewey formula so it’s not going to be great on deep skin anyway. Deeper skin produces its own oil. They made it very clear they don’t care, I’m so disappointed. They could have waited to release it to make more shades.
9157 2018-01-16 02:12:21 My favorite YL essential oil is Copaíba...I had just purchased my kit and my son was teething, I had tried everything out there and after 3 sleepless nights, I googled an EO to use on his gums. And it finally worked, he slept throughout the night and that’s my miracle oil!

9159 2018-01-16 02:11:54 Can’t see which tweet you replied to but if it’s the one where I mentioned the oil industry then you can ignore the stats as this is the slowest it’s been since pre 2000

why do you have coconut oil beside your bed, kell?
9165 2018-01-16 02:11:01 Cuomo is out of touch. the wind farms would be worth the cost with today technology. we'll need oil for at least another 30 years probably until alternative sources are cheap, plentiful and abundant.

9167 2018-01-16 02:10:56 Modi would hope for the oil prices to settle down as it has already started reflecting on inflation, /trade deficit. Just in time before 2019. Big challenge now.. How to push growth?

9176 2018-01-16 02:09:26 Another ignorant /pol statement. Venezuela has massive amounts of shale oil (the Koch brothers used to buy it before the Alberta tar sands). Banks and corporations are destabilizing that country to ripen it for exploitation, which is purely capitalistic. Like Iraq, Haiti, etc.

9182 2018-01-16 02:08:42 Given #Nigeria is an oil rich country, I'm sure they thank America for helping build some sweet @$$ "huts" at $3/gl. Think about that when you pull up to the gas station feeling so superior.
9183 2018-01-16 02:08:36 Well not if they don't have oil anyway.
9184 2018-01-16 02:08:35 mmmm mmmmm warm oil.
9185 2018-01-16 02:08:29 But how does the oil taste ? Coming from a land where pineapple was compulsory on pizza until I was at least 21, I still maintain ... no fish, no fruit (except anchovies, and don’t start on peppers bein fruit)

9192 2018-01-16 02:07:30 I highly recommend a steak cut that will sear fast but not over cook: 
2" wide short ways across the fillet, through the skin
cut those in half down to, not through the skin
fold the skin against itself, sear on oil on each side high heat, 1 min each side.

9230 2018-01-16 02:01:37 Sear in olive oil then cover and turn down the heat. Makes the outside crisp and inside tender. Yummy.
9231 2018-01-16 02:01:29 Water is wet. If water makes things wet but isn’t wet, then why can’t it make oil wet? So, water is wet
9232 2018-01-16 02:01:23 Cause they have lots of oil. And because they hate Iran
9233 2018-01-16 02:00:52 Chris Cuomo is as mentally deficient as his father and brother.  Perhaps more so, as he is in fantasy entertainment instead of snake oil sales.
9234 2018-01-16 02:00:25 Oh thank you been looking something like this and your right profits from war and big bucks for oil that keep gong up. It might go down in Nov and back up in Dec. Repost in NOV so all will know why we're in another war we can't win.

9242 2018-01-16 01:59:46 I've been really focussing on doing more for my skin lately just keeping it really well moisturised, using an oil at night, and not wearing any make up on an everyday basis unless I'm meeting friends or doing something fancy. Also getting back into the habit of keeping hydrated

9245 2018-01-16 01:59:33 I agree, let’s start retracting all foreign military bases immediately...never mind exposing much needed resources (oil) to hostilities...among a long list. Let China and Russia take the lead...I am sure we can live with that.
9246 2018-01-16 01:59:32 After seasoning a new baking stone, I'm now convinced my entire kitchen is made of oil
9247 2018-01-16 01:59:30 An oil well might be worth 3X trailing cash flow, a shale well maybe up to 7X if it's old and in low decline.  So I'm not seeing value where these assets are trading below NPV.  (*The industry's NPV and IRR and DCF calculations are bogus.)

9253 2018-01-16 01:57:50 I'll take a POTUS that speaks without a filter before I'll ever believe one that's a scripted snake oil salesman. We had 8 years of that nonsense and look what happened.

Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams,
with myriad streams of oil?
9266 2018-01-16 01:56:40 Very real struggles combined with Venezuela's reliance on oil as their only major export makes their economy very vulnerable. That said, Venezuela isn't the model Bernie is trying to recreate. Bernie is attempting to appropriate the social policies of successful capitalist

9272 2018-01-16 01:54:58 From what I been told the ice cream is mega-frozen like super hard type shit and then it's flash-fried so it only spends moments in the (extremely hot) oil, insulated by the batter, which is just enough time for the batter to fry and the ice cream to get soft

never had it
9273 2018-01-16 01:54:47 What happens when we run out of oil for gas? Regardless of how efficient the engine it's run though, it will eventually run out.

9282 2018-01-16 01:53:53 Once Trump repeals the offshore drilling safety regulations our environment will continue to degrade. He's really doing a good job taking care of our "Great America" and setting up for future generations. Haven't we learned from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill 8 years prior?

9313 2018-01-16 01:48:23 The series was Ultimatum, Exxoneration, Exodus UK and Separation.  Only the first one was based on a premise that was plausible (after Arab Embargo, US President threatens PM with economic sanctions if Canada continues hindering access to our oil & gas).
9314 2018-01-16 01:48:15 What I'm hearing is "if teachers want a pay raise, they need to stop putting greedy, oil funded republicans in office and start voting for people who actually care about the interests of the PEOPLE.."
9315 2018-01-16 01:48:08 True adulthood is going from saving up money for cover charges at night clubs to budgeting for membership to a monthly olive oil club

9326 2018-01-16 01:46:43 Well Pogba missed all the top games so far this season so we’ll see. And it was 137m on 3 Fullbacks. Lukaku will finish ahead of Sterling in goals. I have no doubt about that. United built their empire....City had oil money come in to become successful

9338 2018-01-16 01:44:49 Godamn!  That means that Engerland won't be able to buy our video games, gin, whisky, wool, delicious food or oil, and I don't suppose anybody else on Earth could possibly think they're worth having.  Whatever WILL we do?
9339 2018-01-16 01:44:41 The world is Fast moving from Fuel to Clean Energy, but PMB is spending billions looking for oil in Chad Basin. These men are still stucked in the 60s. Just a shame it is Youths that will still campaign for them because they are from my Region or Religion or for crumbs. L.

9343 2018-01-16 01:44:18 How about a tax cut for billionaires? Or Carrier layoffs? Or the threat of nuclear war? Or CHIP? Or health care? Or the opioid epidemic? Or oil pipelines? Or off-shore drilling? Or minimum wage? Or gun deaths? Or equal pay? 

YOU know nothing besides racism, bots, and Russia.
9344 2018-01-16 01:44:16 Olive oil is delicious. So is pizza. What's the problem here
9345 2018-01-16 01:44:06 That’s why you dab the pizza with napkins to get rid of the excess oil.

9350 2018-01-16 01:43:29 I've heard from guys such as Matheson that even if the Oil would have kept the pick they would have skipped on barzal as many other teams in the first round did
9351 2018-01-16 01:43:22 It's not just the male talent. Chances are at any given point in a shoot I have coconut oil/ lube/ grapeseed oil, spit & cum on my hands. And that's just when I'm the camerawoman :P

2: Brutal Escalator access
3: Front door security 
4: Jespersen is truly horrid
5: Food prices asinine

There is so much that could be better, but Oil have no reason to try.

WARS HAVE CONSEQUENCES. 9/11 helped Bush politically, he was in the oil business w/bin laden.
9360 2018-01-16 01:41:14 Fish oil is good for that.
9361 2018-01-16 01:40:58 Oh for sure. Sautee minced garlic and chopped shallots in cooker in oil for 90 seconds, add rice, stir. Put chicken on top, scored. Add ginger pieces, whole scallions, salt. Pour water for the rice. Close and pressure cook as long you would for pulao or khichdi.

For Stalin knows, times are tough.

9538 2018-01-16 01:11:42 I got pure acetone from @Lowes and 91%isopropyl from @cvspharmacy. 

Unrelated to #3dprinting I also got from Lowes denatured alcohol, lynseed oil for #woodworking and mineral spirits for table top workshop tools preservation (to coat my table saw and band saw with it).
9539 2018-01-16 01:11:31 Doing a coconut oil hair and scalp mask tonight! Worked 2nd job earlier and I'm winding down for the evening.
9540 2018-01-16 01:11:22 His background is in oil and mining and Utah is prime for opening public lands to those industries. That's his motivation in my opinion.
9541 2018-01-16 01:11:18 JSKKSJSS its too cold to not wear something and coconut oil will get all over my sheets if i dont wear something
9542 2018-01-16 01:11:12 Union Oil of California aka Unocal
9543 2018-01-16 01:11:10 My favorite is when someone uses spray oil at Zoom Tan even though it’s not allowed here and you walk in the room and bust your ass and hit your hair off the ground because they got oil everywhere. If this doesn’t explain my day idk what does.
9544 2018-01-16 01:11:00 well it’s as simple as that. my moms acne was never bad but my fathers was awful so I had a mix in between. stress causes sweat. sweat causes oil on the face. breakouts. common sense huh?
9545 2018-01-16 01:10:53 I don't know I find this so stressful. It's like when I found the NSA was watching everything I do, suddenly I had to be so concerned about how I looked at that angle when we were watching porn together. Bummer.
9546 2018-01-16 01:10:31 Despite (slight) lift in CPI, $USD index near 3yr low in Asia, while cratering against Yuan ($CNY). Gold, oil both moving higher. Yet, US equity futures still green. Very interesting dynamic here. @KHerriage @PeterSchiff

9550 2018-01-16 01:10:16 I highly suggest the radiance oil by @derma_e and @SunKissAlba it has worked wonders for my skin
9551 2018-01-16 01:10:08 I've been trying to take care of my car, so I checked my oil before the light came on today. It needed oil, but now my hands smell like oil. was it worth it? #whoknows

9557 2018-01-16 01:09:18 City saying Sanchez is too expensive.  

Fuck me, City do have a limit after all when it comes to money.  2008 when they inherited the billions of Oil money they have six of the top ten highest paid players in the PL.
9558 2018-01-16 01:09:02 Ya but you have to partially thank Yzerman for beauvillier too. The second oil pick was used by Tampa to draft Stephens.

9560 2018-01-16 01:08:40 @VET1986 what can you do? he is talking about head hunting. can you visit my house on foot, not by plane? Persian want to use oil to remove asphalt roads rather planes. I don't plan air strikes. I need ground forces.
9561 2018-01-16 01:08:35 あそこ本当に美味しいんで関西に来る機会があったら行ってあげてくださいw
9562 2018-01-16 01:08:28 Oil is up, fundamentals are good, wonder why RIL is sale?
9563 2018-01-16 01:08:20 Sure if the Oil want to offer McDavid for OEL straight up we'd take it so fast there would be a smoke outline of GMJC. 

Theres a world of difference between that and 'I want to receive offers for OEL'
9564 2018-01-16 01:08:15 I’m 5,000 miles over my oil change 
9565 2018-01-16 01:08:13 Flu season is upon us friends 
Get your golden milk on:

-milk (i use yellow pea or almond)
-coconut oil
-turmeric 
-ginger
-cayenne
-cinnamon
-black pepper
-honey or maple syrup if you like it sweet

Blend then heat or heat then strain
9566 2018-01-16 01:07:48 Florida is the only coastal state excluded from offshore oil drilling... because of #MaraLaGo and Rick Scott didn’t even ask for it!
9567 2018-01-16 01:07:45 @narendramodi are crude oil is at high,at international level?Then why,it is rising here? Sir, honesty, affection, patriotism, humanity, loyalty & integrity are the attributes, posses not in parts, either 0 or 100%. Your anti corruption derive too,going selectively & for commons.
9568 2018-01-16 01:07:44 Even if it was three pepperoni cups full of pepperoni oil it’s better than no pizza.
9569 2018-01-16 01:07:36 If you're not eating pizza for the oil then why are you eating it?
9570 2018-01-16 01:07:35 Still very confused on where the coconut oil is
9571 2018-01-16 01:07:35 Eat your veggies with and/or saute your veggies in a nice extra virgin olive oil instead of just raw or boiling them. The fat in olive oil is healthy & helps with absorption of carotenes. Fat in general makes you feel more full. I’m not vegan, but I eat a ton of vegetables.
9572 2018-01-16 01:07:21 That's some cRUDE oil you're using if it's messing with your recordings....
9573 2018-01-16 01:06:44 Price of oil hit a 52 week high today 
9574 2018-01-16 01:06:20 Somebody called Offset stupid for cheating on Cardi B because she’s the type of girl to “pour hot oil in your ear while you’re asleep” LMAOOO
9575 2018-01-16 01:05:46 Well if this article doesn't expose the GOP tax/wealth transfer! "These r all based on political contributions of companies in the S&P 500. It's the top political contributors to Republicans...It's abt 21 percent industrials, abt 20 percent financials about 17 percent oil & gas."

9577 2018-01-16 01:05:18 got my oil changed & new tires, hopefully i can wash my car sometime this week after work, hate a dirty ass car!
9578 2018-01-16 01:05:18 coconut oil based actually works quite well
9579 2018-01-16 01:05:05 “Oh the garlic burned, but its ok, it’s garlic oil now, all the garlic flavor has ~infused~ into the sauce”

It tastes like burnt garlic.
9580 2018-01-16 01:05:04 Is all that food your eating include *plenty* of protein? Eggs, fish, meats, nuts and seeds (not peanuts)? Another food group for satiation is healthy fats, such as coconut milk/oil/yogurt, olives, nuts and seeds (not peanuts), avocados etc.
9581 2018-01-16 01:04:53 Don’t forget...and connected to Russia or Big Oil

9584 2018-01-16 01:04:02 Coconut oil makes your hair stronger and causes less breakage
9585 2018-01-16 01:04:01 See what kind of momo oil plays get.  Low floater can pop fast
9586 2018-01-16 01:03:33 That's the other  name of the game it's like the sultan  he has oil  does he steal money  or  wait for his family to sell it

9588 2018-01-16 01:03:19 My mom asked why I was wearing lip gloss in the house but its literally just oil from my pasta lmao

9591 2018-01-16 01:02:56 yea i think that’s a big problem i’ve had in the past, being too afraid to let it get greasy. i’ve heard of biotin, but how exactly does coconut oil come into the equation?

9594 2018-01-16 01:02:48 But, seriously.  Norway is cherry picking a barely populated nation that can exploit it's North Sea oil addiction to provide everybody more than an average quality of life.  It worked for Venezuela for awhile too, but eventually the free ride can get derailed or abruptly end.
9595 2018-01-16 01:02:48 Got oil on my Tims lord I’m sick rn

9603 2018-01-16 01:01:28 Avocado oil tastes milder and less olive-y than good olive oil
9604 2018-01-16 01:01:28 These health vegan freaks telling me that putting some neem oil CURES my endometriosis. Boi BELIEVE ME. IF NEEM CURES ENDOMETRIOSIS I'D ALREADY HAD PUT A WHOLE CONTAINER UP MY VAGINA.

9610 2018-01-16 01:00:41 The US needs to talk about this and threaten sanctions against Saudia Arabia about the indiscrimate bombing they are doing since we dont really need their oil anymore.
9611 2018-01-16 01:00:38 It is upsetting, but seems that only a crisis can trigger a real resolution in #Iran. Possibilities are a major #earthquake, a sudden fall of #oil price, or death of #Khamenei -the supreme leader.

9614 2018-01-16 01:00:05 Plus, it's not COLD oil. We're not animals.
9615 2018-01-16 00:59:52 I loved her like a madman. We’d get drunk some days and have wild passionate sex at night. I’d be grabbing her hair, choking her neck and slapping her ass. On Sundays, I bought her flowers and rubbed her body down with oil.
9616 2018-01-16 00:59:32 #Oil: We keep our neutral stance as we expect crude oil to trade close to its fair  value range of 45-55 USD.

9620 2018-01-16 00:59:22 Idk if you’re still having an issue, but lavender oil might help. Putting a dab behind each ear & rubbing a dab or two into the soles of her feet might soothe her.
9621 2018-01-16 00:59:18 This should be worldwide, especially when one considers the debacle that was "THE GULF of MEXICO" and the ongoing damage to every shoreline in that area !
The people of the world should stand united against this "OIL COMPANY VANDALISM" 
9622 2018-01-16 00:59:00 it’s because i only moisturize with oil that’s why i have no idea. i don’t use commercial face products af all

9631 2018-01-16 00:57:05 Well it's OK to cover them in batter and deep fry them in oil, it's ok to pull them out of the river, stream, lake or see by a chuffing big barbed hook in their mouths so what's less barbaric than that??

9636 2018-01-16 00:56:35 I don't like favouritism, even when watching the Oil feed. I get frustrated when I can see we're struggling but broadcast crews don't call it out. I also don't like it when they try to teach or explain the game, but probably good for newbie fans.
9637 2018-01-16 00:56:28 DRILL DRILL! America first. Put people to work! Oil workers need to work. America needs their own oil! Time to cut away from the Middle East.
9638 2018-01-16 00:56:25 Measured skepticism is always good. The strategy of US oil and gas majors looks like the coal industry 10-15 years ago. Measured skepticism warranted for that strategy too.
9639 2018-01-16 00:56:07 I don't know for a fact but in my opinion they didn't need the oil at all they were wanted what was underneath oil probably which is probably metal lies lies lies and More Lies that is just my hypothetical Theory
9640 2018-01-16 00:56:04 That wasn't politically motived. Purely from an economics standpoint. Big expensive vehicles and attainably priced oil.

9644 2018-01-16 00:55:48 they could open a warm oil restaurant and I'd line up
9645 2018-01-16 00:55:45 The sooner were free from oil the better.
9646 2018-01-16 00:55:43 I was supposed to get a oil change in like October I need to stop playin
9647 2018-01-16 00:55:28 From this day forward I only moisturize my skin with argan oil. 
Shit I been in this cold for over 7 hours and my face and hands still smoother than a bitch.
9648 2018-01-16 00:55:20 Dipping bread in warm oil is the best. That tweet just makes me want to eat oil.
9649 2018-01-16 00:55:00 Why it's being used if it is bad? What are benefits of this oil?
9650 2018-01-16 00:54:58 To Vladimir Putin? The Israeli government killing Palestinians? Polluting oil and coal companies? Transphobic Evangelicals? White Supremacists? Thank your pretend "president" Trump.
9651 2018-01-16 00:54:50 I had to change O rings on base plate where oil filter screws on. Tightened all the pan bolt while there. Has helped a lot, but still uses oil.

9663 2018-01-16 00:53:08 Hard to know what to think. Oil Trains crash and leak. Pipelines leak pretty regularly. Offshore operations are uncontainable in breach. Tankers break, burn and sink. Maybe we should stop moving this crap around, seek alternatives. Yeah, good. Life will thank us.
9664 2018-01-16 00:53:07 Deregulations is hurting the people, banks can charge more, waters polluted, digging for oil destroys waters. Jobs lost, businesses closing. Trump could care less he's destroying the economy. Big Corps and wealthy got more welfare than anytime in history. He could care less.

9682 2018-01-16 00:50:52 omg... heres hoping we drill soooo much oil that we manufacture a glut and 1/2 of oil companies go bankrupt!
9683 2018-01-16 00:50:36 This Jamaican castor oil better have me #teambeardgang by next month lol
9684 2018-01-16 00:50:31 When the surgeon sliced into his hip, what he saw looked like a crankcase full of dirty oil. Tissue  surrounding the hip was black. Cobalt leaking caused  metallosis, destroying tendons and ligaments, but harming Dr. Tower’s heart and brain as well.  (Hip Surgery for you?)WAPO
9685 2018-01-16 00:50:31 I’m talking essential oil going, humidifier filled, skin care routine. All a that

9688 2018-01-16 00:50:27 @FrenchRev how can you write this much about food and still use truffle oil?
9689 2018-01-16 00:50:25 About to douse another oak log in vegetable oil, in case you're curious how that whole "remembering to buy lighter fluid" situation is going.
9690 2018-01-16 00:50:22 But I also use a lot of oil in the shower so if y’all ever heard I was found naked in a burned down house, that’s why.
9691 2018-01-16 00:49:50 When that dude at the smoke shop was talking about cbd oil
9692 2018-01-16 00:49:46 you've been south of the tanks too long. I know what would knock some sense into you. An oil can at 10:30 in the morning after a night of drinking
9693 2018-01-16 00:49:45 Where are you Andy Harris? You do not stand with your constituents in their time of challenge and need. You work against them to deny them health care, equal access to the internet, working against clean energy and allowing oil wells off our coast.
9694 2018-01-16 00:49:40 But endangering the coastline by allowing oil drilling unlike in Florida where he owns Beach view property?  Was that the trade?
9695 2018-01-16 00:49:34 They must be the equivalent of three spoons of cold oil 
9696 2018-01-16 00:49:30 Today I started taking the same breakfast routine like I had back in uni days. Breads with olive oil. 
9697 2018-01-16 00:49:27 hyojin: why are you naked and covered in oil?!?

changyoon: you know how you always say I never glisten?

hyojin: listen. you never listen.

9701 2018-01-16 00:48:55 @OccupyWisdom @GregMannarino @steemit @DiMartinoBooth may as well compare wheat & oil! This is utter nonsense
9702 2018-01-16 00:48:46 Caucasians were the first to industrialize in the modern world. That’s the fact. The Middle East is wealthy from living on top of oil, are you going to blame them for all of us missing out on that?
9703 2018-01-16 00:48:43 Kalau ikutkan hati ni malas betul tiap2 pagi nak makan supplements, B complex la, glucosamine la, fish oil la. Tapi bila fikir balik Ibu pesan nak sihat, nak kuat, nak cergas, nak cantik kena rajin, jangan malas. Jadi jangan lupa pesanan Ibu.
9704 2018-01-16 00:48:42 No, but suddenly I’m craving 3 spoonfuls of warm oil.
9705 2018-01-16 00:48:39 Hi friend nice to meet you I am  Beat Friedrich I am Marine Drilling Engineer I also supply crude oil and gas I Contract Drilling of crude oil I am from Bern Switzerland please reply for Business Investment partnership.
9706 2018-01-16 00:48:32 Except the fish, being uncooked, will have been zero-rated and not have had VAT paid on it, so nothing to reclaim. See also oil, peas, salt etc…
9707 2018-01-16 00:48:16 I’m glad that got cleared up! I did hear the rumor you were running around as the Oil Queen in drag.
9708 2018-01-16 00:48:15 So goes the propaganda from every snake oil salesman. Under-5 child mortality has been cut in half in the US just since the 1980’s! #VaccinesWork
9709 2018-01-16 00:48:00 @chelseallyn I also need to steam my nose with eucalyptus oil.
9710 2018-01-16 00:47:52 The rest of the country is also beautiful and needs oil to afford to visit your coastline that is longer than what a few oil well would destroy in the view from your office or residence
9711 2018-01-16 00:47:38 You know what they say about spoonfuls of warm oil...nectar of the Gods
9712 2018-01-16 00:47:37 If He  couldn't be touched, what humiliation awaits the woman with the jar of Oil?

9714 2018-01-16 00:47:08 Naa, I’ve always felt that way every time I’ve had palm oil rice — especially when I consume it the next day. I’m gonna try you method and make sure to credit it to you lol
9715 2018-01-16 00:46:39 yeah the warm oil thing just made me want to make fresh hummus with warm olive oil on it so that wasn’t a good example
9716 2018-01-16 00:46:38 And if it’s high end olive oil? I’d drink that.

9720 2018-01-16 00:46:14 Well if your oil light comes on, u may have lost all oil pressure, and in that case do not keep driving. Or u will need a new engine.
9721 2018-01-16 00:46:09 I am bad at face moisturizer recs bc my head is the only place where my skin produces more than enough oil (well not my eyes or cheeks or lips)
9722 2018-01-16 00:46:03 Me applying argan oil to my hair: wow I can’t wait for this to fix all of my problems
9723 2018-01-16 00:46:01 6 spoons of warm oil ftw

9725 2018-01-16 00:45:29 Hell's bells, some places even use peanut oil! I shudder to think of someone with a nut allergy encountering that.
9726 2018-01-16 00:45:19 I just drank castor oil I’m over this
9727 2018-01-16 00:45:17 Hoping this bio oil works for my face bc I’m sick of these ugly ass acne scars and uneven skin 
9728 2018-01-16 00:45:04 I should use my foreo more since I have it. But I do salcylic acid cleanser, ACV toner, salcylic and tea tree oil spot treatment, and the una cream right now.
9729 2018-01-16 00:45:00 Just in case, if your oil light comes on change the oil. Don't buy a new engine.
9730 2018-01-16 00:44:52 The ringgit will remain strong due to:

1. Broad-based US dollar weakness
2. The renewed confidence in macroeconomic performance
3. BNM requirement for exporters to convert 75% of their proceeds back into ringgit
4. Oil prices
9731 2018-01-16 00:44:46 @mikexingchen your hot oil enthusiasm got me to try some for myself. the wife and i make our own hot oil now, just like you. HOT OIL ALL THE THINGS
9732 2018-01-16 00:44:43 An apologist for everything Spanish. Stick to filling bags in Biggleswade Sainsbury. Oil money v financial fair play equals not this time Pep. You are on a bad run son just admit it.
9733 2018-01-16 00:44:41 OILは店名通りこだわった油の使い方、珍々は美味さと辛さの完成形、華隆餐館は四川飯店みたいな上品さはないけど本場四川を感じさせる粗野にして美味、といったところでしょうか
9734 2018-01-16 00:44:40 Now, if our east coast governors can keep the horrible oil rigs out of our oceans we'll be in good shape!

9736 2018-01-16 00:44:36 Sometimes it can be hormonal as we age...try evening Primrose oil supplements...helps from the inside out.
9737 2018-01-16 00:44:14 If you have ordered CBD OIL from me, and we have not had a chat yet, please message me! I have some very important tips for you!
9738 2018-01-16 00:44:09 Ditto. Genuine smiles. Lived in real world. Worked hard. Honest. The list (of contrasts) to the snake oil salesman, his Natasha-esque wife, and the whole corpus lot of them is dramatic. Upside down.
9739 2018-01-16 00:43:26 And??? Without that oil money u would still be planning for top 10 
9740 2018-01-16 00:43:18 Had the entire truck wash barn to myself! I guess no one else has to wash oil off their vehicle tonight.  

Got to take my time & pay & leave it in there extra long. No one to get it dirty beside me.

9741 2018-01-16 00:43:16 Not now mom, oil prices are down 
9742 2018-01-16 00:43:15 i’ve heard that bio oil can help reduce scarring if it bothers you but honestly you can’t tell in the pictures and anyone who cared about you enough to be up close enough to your tummy to see, it wouldn’t even bother them 
9743 2018-01-16 00:43:03 Doing a hair mask: Warms up coconut, then adds egg. Cold eggs makes coconut oil harden. Puts mixture in microwave for 9 SECONDS...The egg is cooked half way  the struggle is real
9744 2018-01-16 00:42:58 This essential oil diffuser is one of the best purchase I’ve bought.
9745 2018-01-16 00:42:47 No,everybody touches Jesus or touched by Him. Be it the Leper, be it the woman with the issue of blood, be it the woman with the oil, be it the blind man, be it Jairus.
9746 2018-01-16 00:42:36 next time I think about shaving my legs with coconut oil rather than just getting in the tub...ima need someone to remind me what a terrible idea that is for my sensitive skin.

9749 2018-01-16 00:41:43 Or is that good? It looks as if the spicy oil and red pepper were cooked together for a hundred years just to be used in that dish.
9750 2018-01-16 00:41:42 That's rich - His government hired every anti-oil Nazi in Canada to organize the blocking of Alberta-to-the-world oil pipelines. It was as if the idiots we elected didn't know WHERE Alberta's treasury money came from.

9753 2018-01-16 00:41:30 When radio frequencies go faster doesn't it register at the transmitter? A South African satellite broadcasting radio frequencies could probably find plenty of oil under the Sahara?
9754 2018-01-16 00:41:20 Is oil city worked going to work at 2 am??? @NavarroOEM
9755 2018-01-16 00:41:19 Maybe he hasn't read the Bible. It says we are to anoint our heads with oil, wash our face and comb our hair as if nothing is going on in our life. In other words don't walk around looking and feeling like what you are going or been through.
9756 2018-01-16 00:41:19 If oil costs above $70, then electrification of nearly all transport will continue apace. Requiring carbon capture will most likely make non-emitting power sources dominant.
9757 2018-01-16 00:41:11 expect a lot more arson as the EV starts to change the mode of transport and  wrecks the oil / petrol industry including gas stations, spare parts and maintenance shops - still want the option on my phone to record what the car sees
9758 2018-01-16 00:40:48 I’ve been in Florida for an hour and I can already feel the oil on my face getter my worse and my hair getting bigger

9780 2018-01-16 00:38:10 By that logic you MUST understand that overvaluing oil caused of much of the problems in Venezuela right? Oh wait, bad for your narrative

9782 2018-01-16 00:37:53 You might be getting one that has added alcohol in it :/ I wondered why it burned the scrap out of my skin and t was because I didn’t get the 100% pure tea tree oil

9790 2018-01-16 00:36:21 It had oil.
9791 2018-01-16 00:36:20 thank God for coconut oil
9792 2018-01-16 00:36:12 I like lower-gas prices  and heating oil prices.  I like the thought of being independent of foreign oil.  So I will be happy to tell Secretary Zinke to go forward with his plan.
9793 2018-01-16 00:35:26 There's plenty of oil beneath the desert of Saudi Arabia and plenty of desert in the Sahara and bottled water.
9794 2018-01-16 00:35:25 I’m not too concerned about this ethical oil nonsense. What does concern me is that every time the price goes up because of actions taken by the alleged bad guys, the real bad guys, the Americans take measures to collapse the price yet again.

9796 2018-01-16 00:35:06 I do have a friend who gets anything I want from a dispensary, I like the vapor, & he gets oil to make candies or stuff out of to travel with or take on planes
9797 2018-01-16 00:34:57 @amazingatheist @PaulsEgo @KaiserScoopy You guys should do an episode of DFF on Mohammad Mossadaq, the former President (or whatever) of Iran that got ousted by the US because he didn't want to share their oil. I think that would be interesting
9798 2018-01-16 00:34:54 I must agree with this. There are trillions of barrels of various fossil fuels on the Earth, and as technology progresses, we will be able to unlock even more sources.
Carbon capture would increase cost of oil by 20% at most though, for net neutral CO2.
9799 2018-01-16 00:34:47 Wish they would ditch the Sunflower and Safflower oils in lieu of Extra Virgin Olive oil, or no oil.

9817 2018-01-16 00:33:03 Coconut or olive oil. Don’t forget to grease/moisturize your scalp too!
9818 2018-01-16 00:32:53 Pagi hari ini harga Minyak (Crude Oil New York ) 64.5$/ barrel , kembali naik tertingginya sejak May 2015, break high 63.2. Harga BBM di RI pun sdh akan terus di naikan. Apkh kenaikan ini berdasarkan supply & deman theori ? Tidak. Ini Hanya Rekayasa Mafia. Pertamina & ESDM Tau?
9819 2018-01-16 00:32:00 Like a place where oil springs up from the ground if you dig and you can fly on a magic carpet?
9820 2018-01-16 00:31:46 Right?? Oil on your face! It very much is good. It actually makes my skin...less oily??? So weird.
9821 2018-01-16 00:31:42 Yep. Cheap boneless chops cut into strips. The sauce was simple: soy sauce, rice vinegar, sesame oil, sambal oelek, honey, ginger, garlic. Very light and healthy.
9822 2018-01-16 00:31:42 #High-tech Japanese have been working on vehicles that run indefinitely, fuel free, on road systems that are powered. Wow! Will be interesting see how Big Oil reacts and attempts blockage of that technology.
9823 2018-01-16 00:31:41 But that’s the thing. A lot of us were sounding the alarm but I suppose the snake oil salesmen is mesmerizing.
9824 2018-01-16 00:31:34 I have a oil diffuser now, so yeah life is going great
9825 2018-01-16 00:31:31 If it wasn’t for your oil money you would be in the championship, so sit down and take the L with your small club mentality
9826 2018-01-16 00:31:02 Mine when away on its own after a few days - warm showers, gently massaging the eyelid downwards (apparently its mostly just a blockage on the pipes that oil the lashes so no risks of doing harm) and ibuprofen for the pain!
9827 2018-01-16 00:30:52 I needa get that for my mom . The oil
9828 2018-01-16 00:30:43 More #oil? Certainly!
9829 2018-01-16 00:30:41 changyoon is seasoning this steak with just salt and olive oil.... he rly doesnt know how to cook and thats valid
9830 2018-01-16 00:30:40 forget about tide pods i'm drinking straight vegetable oil from now on
9831 2018-01-16 00:30:19 The doctor of Caitlyn Jenner assessed another Olive oil and operated sisal!!!
9832 2018-01-16 00:30:18 Then she kept telling me about this special castor oil she got at the “healthy food store” and now she doesn’t have pain anymore.
9833 2018-01-16 00:30:11 Why didn't Moonilal and the UNC didn't fix Ramai Trace Hindu School when they were in gov't . They were there for five years and three months .Oil price was up to $104.00 US per barrel . Maybe there was no benefits for them
9834 2018-01-16 00:29:55 Try coconut oil.   No joke. Miracle.
9835 2018-01-16 00:29:45 Two if you cook it with corn oil or vegetable oil
9836 2018-01-16 00:29:33 If it's 3 spoons of warm olive oil it's fine
9837 2018-01-16 00:29:20 I go through my Argon oil like crazy
9838 2018-01-16 00:29:18 There's an enormous amount of coal in the US; can be converted to gas & oil. Plus HUGE oil shale (not fracking but kerogen) deposits haven't been tapped. Over a trillion barrels in one formation (Green River Basin in Wyoming/Colorado/Utah). Won't run out; we'll ruin the air 1st.
9839 2018-01-16 00:29:14 The #oil market was very different (in quality terms) when strategic storage obligations were first implemented. Those obligations probably need updating, but no one’s told the politicians. Anywhere.
9840 2018-01-16 00:29:14 Going to be 1 of the best Presidents ever!  he took that snake oil from obama to give it to CNN and their followers! Get use to it! You got 7 more years of it!

9854 2018-01-16 00:27:02 Well at least we know he was critical of the White Paper and that oil won't be baked in. I think the presentation from him will be "a few years of economic suffering but worth it for our independence" - I think Scot's will ultimately only hear the "suffering" bit and turn off.
9855 2018-01-16 00:26:33 Oil filter is back there to. It drains in a different spot. But yeah filter is in a bad spot

- Eliminated mandatory reporting of payments to foreign governments by oil companies
- Eliiminated Civil Rights Act protection for transgender workers
- Eliminated oversight of for-profit colleges
9858 2018-01-16 00:26:08 All I’m worried about right now is getting my nails and oil change done sometime this week

9861 2018-01-16 00:25:38 You have to go through the tank for the engine oil filters? I thought that was just concave shear bolts.
9862 2018-01-16 00:25:37 @ThomasWictor 
Dear Thomas, what's your opinion about Iranian ship which was burning and drowned recently, in China Sea?
It's been said there was an accident btwn two ships, but the rumors say she was smuggling crude oil to North Korea, and was hit by a torpedo.

According to it. 
Buddy called in to vocm said he can drive it through the mattress. His wife loves it.
Hahahaha.
9865 2018-01-16 00:25:23 I remember a song from my youth, with a lyric that went "imagine any mix up and the lot could go."  I think the band was called "Midnight Oil" or something like that. Whatever happened to them I wonder...
9866 2018-01-16 00:25:12 This is a simply Emergency Response Program that every oil company in existence must have and know how to use .,  Surely a US State should be able to master this without a Federal babysitter
9867 2018-01-16 00:25:09 Agreed. There are guys who work hard on cars and oil. His hands be looking dirty so his woman’s stay clean. He played himself

9869 2018-01-16 00:25:05 You have a surplus with Canada overall due to the current low oil prices, and a 5-1 trade surplus with Canada over dairy.
9870 2018-01-16 00:24:44 As a whole the world has fought for religion, racism, equality, sexuality, land and oil. Yet we don't really fight against bullying. A few good people make posts but it still feels like an empty gesture. If you hear or see something DO SOMETHING.
9871 2018-01-16 00:24:39 I thought the snp is always parading about how much oil we have, conspiracy theorists would say countries often get invaded for their oil?
