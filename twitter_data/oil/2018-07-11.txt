0 2018-07-11 23:59:50 With regard of cost of snake oil compared to established therapies, hmm well, we don’t know again. Let’s assume the cost is one tenth compared to drug x. If it’s half as effective in a disease which would cost 100x more if untreated, well, than probably more expensive. So...
1 2018-07-11 23:59:47 I am SHOCKED that Federal LEOs would arrest people interfering with Federal LEOs!
2 2018-07-11 23:59:45 Rum and raspberries? Or old oil slicks? I’ve heard it was either one.
3 2018-07-11 23:59:34 First, why do you think it's cool to resort to such informal language as "toots". It makes you look the opposite actually, like That Guy. Anyway Norway is anything but broke. They have earned a fortune from North Sea Oil, saved it, & support their econmy thru their tax code.
4 2018-07-11 23:59:31 Yeah we are. Delivery came in with everyone we don’t need and none of the shit we do need. So no oil for any theaters. They had to buy oil from smiths
5 2018-07-11 23:59:27 Keep yapping.  There must still be a couple of gullible voters who are buying your snake oil.
6 2018-07-11 23:59:20 Exactly.... Russia is closer to Germany than us oil or opec oil... logistics win out
7 2018-07-11 23:59:15 Anyone who knows where to obtain CBD oil I need ASAP please and thank you 
8 2018-07-11 23:59:09 I'm surprised it took the #TradeWar so long to smack #Oil and other #Commodities, but it finally did
9 2018-07-11 23:59:03 Love to know where you get your stats. Germany does not buy 65% of its oil and gas from Russia. Dolt
10 2018-07-11 23:58:54 I’ve been eating nothing but Italian bread dipped in olive oil and pesto for the past two days and I can’t and will not stop
11 2018-07-11 23:58:34 Of course there r intricate layers - we haven’t even touched on economic warfare from National State v National State - think US v USSR and Regean. Essentially bankrupted them, oh and the recent moves from OPEC accepting non-FRNs for oil purchases. Losing world Rsrv crrncy status
12 2018-07-11 23:58:33 We pay Canada, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela for the majority of our oil imports, Spanky. Does that invalidate US security posture, and if so, how?
13 2018-07-11 23:58:33 And trump bitching cause Germany getting oil and natural gas from Russia well up till about 6 or 8 month ago we did not offer any oil or natural gas to that area of the world we just built port to handle natural gas exports
14 2018-07-11 23:58:20 Heres an idea: Invest in renewable energy and sell it to Germany, Ukraine, anywhere that Russia has their oil being sent to.

Oh right, you wont do that because youre a giant turd.
15 2018-07-11 23:58:12 Even so, it’s a dying market a Germany switches to solar and other renewables! The only countries not heading that direction are holding (probably large) oil interests that will be left to squabble amongst themselves as the rest of the world moves on.

34 2018-07-11 23:57:58 I do not believe what is said .... 

Yes, I believe Cell Phone Towers using microwave is heating the atmosphere but I would have to say from my studies Gas & Oil Companies have more play in Geoengineering and Spraying of Chemicals

My Opinion 

(Might need to investigate video)
35 2018-07-11 23:57:58 When leaping from a 15th storey window, take lavender oil to reduce any stress
36 2018-07-11 23:57:52 Bullshit.
37 2018-07-11 23:57:37 Amazing to hear Baby Trump complain about Germany helping Russia by building a pipeline to receive Russian oil, while Baby Trump takes Putin's pipeline in the mouth every chance he gets. ..
38 2018-07-11 23:57:32 "Oh her.."
39 2018-07-11 23:57:21 Merkel just bought 70% oil and gas off Russia and is CEO of pipeline company that’s distributing it.
40 2018-07-11 23:57:18 I need to get my oil changed 
41 2018-07-11 23:56:43 Midnight oil it is.
42 2018-07-11 23:56:30 But you're going to "hammer" Putin to produce more oil. Oil that provides cash for his kleptocracy. Oil that he can't produce due to the sanctions that prevent him from accessing funding, technology, and expertise. 

You will ease sanctions in the name of oil. Quid pro quo.
43 2018-07-11 23:56:16 Blip Sir. Almost all predictions suggest increase in oil/fossil fuel consumption for the next 2-3 decades. However, per capita consumption may decline in developed/developing nations..so that's a tiny 'yehhh'
44 2018-07-11 23:56:10 That is a secret.. lol
45 2018-07-11 23:56:10 Need Oil and Gas
Germany buys from Russia
And not
IRAN
that's telling

48 2018-07-11 23:55:40 I got a pair of shorts with an oil stain pls wash
49 2018-07-11 23:55:32 Rosemary, thyme, salt, touch of cayenne,  infused oil (garlic and onion) to make a paste, rub it, let it sit; almost smoking pan with more infused oil, couple Rosemary's first then sear it, butter and wine and spoon the juice as it finishes, rest it, lil homemade tzatziki, devour
50 2018-07-11 23:55:31 Wow I didn't realised how tense I was till I dumped medicated oil everywhere. Instant relief manz :'))
51 2018-07-11 23:55:25 They can’t afford it now with Sky money and I’m gonna change my pinned tweet to Everton will still be at Goodison in 2030 , Moshiri is a snske oil salesman as bad as Hicks and Gillette 
Sell to buy allegedly doesn’t make sense to me considering ‘you’re rich’
52 2018-07-11 23:55:23 I would say he had it just right. Germany wants us to defend a possible Russian threat and yet they make side deal with said foe for gas and oil cutting out other Eastern European nations. In addition they tax our cars at high rates. What did he miss.
53 2018-07-11 23:55:22 The US invoked NATOs Article 5 to combat terrorism, yet America continues to sell billions of dollars in military weapons to Saudi Arabia and contributes billions to their economy via oil purchases.
54 2018-07-11 23:55:19 "In the U.S. there is no standard"?  I disagree. There is a certification process, but not dictated by the government.  The only people global certification would help would be the foreign countries' producers who have been passing off bad olive oil on U.S. consumers for years.
55 2018-07-11 23:55:18 Easy way of finding out where the gays live...look for who's getting the large deliveries of vials of oil.
56 2018-07-11 23:55:18 They tend to also believe that various """"natural"""" substances offer sun protection. Like, they often say coconut oil has SPF 25 (which...no) or that there are herbs you can take that make your skin resistant to UV rays. It's all exactly as silly as it sounds.
57 2018-07-11 23:55:13 Why are we going after @elonmusk instead of billionaire who gained their wealth not from helping the world but from harming it, ie coal and oil tycoons.
58 2018-07-11 23:55:12 oilさんおはようございます///
59 2018-07-11 23:55:09 And since you don't admit that Putin and Democracy are two completely different worlds either you are really ignorant or have some Russian in you or maybe oil is more important to you than the planet earth. And did you ask me a question? Because I don't see it.
60 2018-07-11 23:55:00 this is a scheduled tweet! i need to buy pepper and sesame oil
61 2018-07-11 23:54:54 Thanks Charlie, but I don't think I'm going to trust Exon Oil Co2 reports.
62 2018-07-11 23:54:53 They gave up coal, oil, and nuclear power for what! #OneWorldOrder and #Climatecontrol #Agenda2030 #Bullshit
63 2018-07-11 23:54:52 All key questions when introducing new therapies.
So, let’s give the snake oil the benefit of doubt and say: 
Limited animal studies, some possible effect. Unfortunately no head to head success and no good animal models though.
64 2018-07-11 23:54:45 Me too. But apparently you can't take a step without tripping over vials of oil...
65 2018-07-11 23:54:42 Jiffy lube, if you get your oil changed... lmao 96 bucks tho
66 2018-07-11 23:54:40 "What? Who?!"
67 2018-07-11 23:54:39 I’m well into my sixties and my knees developed huge leaky cysts. My doc want me on CBD oil. I have never done cannabis. I am walking and pain free. I’m a believer.
68 2018-07-11 23:54:31 Are we not paying Venezuela and Saudi Arabia for our oil? Does not China own nearly 100% of our national debt?
69 2018-07-11 23:54:21 Ready for some trivia?! What food is made from vegetables oil, egg yolks, lemon juice, and is possibly named after a town in Spain?
70 2018-07-11 23:54:20 I'd have thought spit was the lube of choice, I mean, thee's not always butter lard or oil available, is there?
71 2018-07-11 23:53:58 Lastly are you defending Russian oil pipelines to a NATO country?
72 2018-07-11 23:53:49 You are jealous that Russia has the gas/oil deal and you want the US to have it.  You better be careful... Putin won't like that!
73 2018-07-11 23:53:47 If a government manages to sucefully exploit its oil reserves to provide wealth to its ppl that is socialism, until its not anymore when that house of cards collapses.
74 2018-07-11 23:53:45 I love my wiVe and life as Brittany Murphy’s oil soap,-.
75 2018-07-11 23:53:04 He used to slice it so thin that it used to liquify in the pan with a little oil. It’s a very good system.
76 2018-07-11 23:53:04 If that's the case, how can the United States transport oil to other countries around the world?
77 2018-07-11 23:52:53 We are living in the golden age of mankind before the collapse into the dark ages. Think about it. How many more fish are in the oceans how much of the rainforest is left? How many animals are extinct? How much oil is left? Ocean plastic? Ozone hole? Our planet is dying! All gone
78 2018-07-11 23:52:53 I hate to tell you, but you’re not the boss of NATO or Europe. 
It is especially ironic that U chide Germany 4 paying money 2 Russia when YOU, PERSONALLY, made an unilateral decision 2 end Iran Agreement, taking all their oil off the market, giving trillions of dollars to Russia
79 2018-07-11 23:52:48 Chamomile drops or baby oil if there isnt an infection. If the sore is really bad better go to the doctor
80 2018-07-11 23:52:47 Well we all know how you voted 
81 2018-07-11 23:52:36 Fee oil change and a car wash! YESS
82 2018-07-11 23:52:36 I stretch mark bad and someone told me to buy bio oil and rub it on my stretch marks everyday.  It really does work. It fades the stretch makes fast!!
83 2018-07-11 23:52:35 Sounds like you need some food. I’ll bring you some of my charred octopus with lemon and olive oil. Usually does the trick.
84 2018-07-11 23:52:28 I just recently learned how bad that stuff is. I used it (or vegetable oil) for everything the last 20 years. I was duped.
85 2018-07-11 23:52:23 And lets remind the rest of the world that this is an oil producing country....but "tienen patria" as the corrupt government claims
86 2018-07-11 23:52:06 Did an aura protection bath with essential oils. After soaking I meditated while in the bath. Once out of the bath I did a coconut oil self love rub while saying affirmations. I feel so much lighter.
87 2018-07-11 23:51:59 Like oil and water
88 2018-07-11 23:51:57 ⠀⠀⠀Leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone..... Words that echoed in her conscience while dark heeled boots broke many sticks and crushed many leaves beneath them. Her porcelain skin felt hot as her blood felt like boiling oil. Her head twitched to +
89 2018-07-11 23:51:54 The gas, which traps heat in Earth’s atmosphere, has been increasing  since the industrial age due to the burning of oil, gas, coal and wood  for energy and is continuing to reach concentrations not seen in at  least 500,000 years. The impacts of climate change include
90 2018-07-11 23:51:54 Or...if they are supplying 60-70% of their Oil, Gas and Natural Gas and Russia decides at whim to shut it down, where will that leave them?  Hurting of course but come on Senator you should know that.
91 2018-07-11 23:51:52 I get Synthetic oil and tires at my job for free
92 2018-07-11 23:51:42 Trump making oil production Great Again.
93 2018-07-11 23:51:38 What good are tariffs raising oil prices resulting in Russia making billions of dollars in oil sales?

94 2018-07-11 23:51:37 At what cost is this 12% reduction going to be?

How do you plan on doing it? You've destroyed the green initiative so there isn't a rebate for people to upgrade their homes to help REDUCE the amount of gas/oil/electricity they use. 

Maybe that was the end game.

96 2018-07-11 23:51:28 @EPAAWheeler @EPA shouldn’t your instinct be to protect the air Americans breathe & the water we drink and the food we eat.  Your instinct shouldn’t be to enrich oil and mining companies owners
97 2018-07-11 23:51:05 Donnie how can you equate a pipeline with a collective security agreement among allies?  Why do you care where Germany gets its oil?  It’s not YOUR money. You are robbing the American people to enrich yourself. RESIGN!
98 2018-07-11 23:50:58 No I used vegetable oil.
99 2018-07-11 23:50:57 Having a car is fun until you paying for oil changes, cleaning after kids and grown ass mfs , inspections, new tires, taxes&tags, oh and I can’t forget gas. 
100 2018-07-11 23:50:56 What I time to have oily skin. I used to hate myself because it looked like I dunked my face in baby oil but now that’s like epitome of beauty? I’m confused... but flattered.

107 2018-07-11 23:50:32 Washed my car, got an oil and filter change and full tank.. 
108 2018-07-11 23:50:32 Grill a Branzino head to tail, use garlic parsley olive oil mix as your topping sauce ..  make sure your grill is wood fired.  
109 2018-07-11 23:50:26 PNG is the heaven for resource companies...most nations highly tax resource companies for example Norway taxes 78% for oil and gas..PNG charges tax for oil and gas between 16 - 22%.. Resource companies also pay NO GST and are often granted serious tax holidays..let that sink in..
110 2018-07-11 23:50:26 And what about buying oil & gas from Putin ?
111 2018-07-11 23:50:23 Strange fixation?Germany is buying billions $ oil from Russia, has shut down their nuclear and coal plants & has opened their borders of millions of immigrants-several of whom may be terrorists. & Germany wants US to defend them-not a fixation -a concern

123 2018-07-11 23:48:48 Every two seconds I’m applying lip gloss chapstick, Vaseline, oil, water, etc anything for my lips this heat is fucking me up and I refuse to look like a crackhead
124 2018-07-11 23:48:45 I have never felt so alive like I do today. I woke up early got my oil changed went to work and have literally had nothing but a smile on my face. Where did this come from 
125 2018-07-11 23:48:42 NATO is not a trade union. There is nothing stopping Germany from getting oil from Russia for a better cost because they don’t have any.
126 2018-07-11 23:48:36 あのぞわわわ感は例えると黒板のあの嫌な音聴いてｲｰｯｯｯ!!!!ってなるアレに近いような…何だろね、木の味と感触が嫌なのかな笑
127 2018-07-11 23:48:31 I hope you didn’t actually buy one. They are snake oil
128 2018-07-11 23:48:19 “So if Germany is beholden to Russia because that’s where they get their oil, by trump’s logic, the US is beholden to Canada. Gotta have a word with Justin; maybe he can rescue me.”
129 2018-07-11 23:48:14 Oh Donald , have you been told Germany are not paying enough fo the oil , does Putin want more is that 
what “ Pipeline $ are unacceptable...or is it because they are paying in Euro “ 
Bad , Sad , Wow , maybe throw in some others when talking about NATO and European borders ...
130 2018-07-11 23:48:12 I did my face routine and the oil actually forces my eyes to close and for the first time I don't mind lekkdkskskd
131 2018-07-11 23:48:03 Ironic that the guy who supposedly colluded with Putin is calling out Germany for giving Putin access to such a large portion of German oil market.  

Reminds me of Uranium One.
132 2018-07-11 23:48:02 Bare minerals! I love there stuff! 
Also coconut oil for everything! 

I also am about to try glossier products but I have no clue about them!
133 2018-07-11 23:47:52 Oil.... what?! The topic was natural gas, and now it’s oil? You guys literally have no flying fuck of a clue what you’re talking about.

135 2018-07-11 23:47:46 There’s no actual butter in that garlic oil stuff, and almost none of it is really ‘food’ at all.
136 2018-07-11 23:47:40 There’s nothing wrong with the fries now.  Keep the truffle oil and Parmesan away from those establishments.
137 2018-07-11 23:47:40 Then do the following:

1- Get oil drilling off our coast out of the defense spending budget you are pushing.

2- Don’t support base closings in South Carolina

3- Demand equal rights, civil rights for all who serve and want to serve.

Then we can all say..good job Tim.
138 2018-07-11 23:47:33 wait changing oil not that easy it’s easy to check and add more tho
139 2018-07-11 23:47:27 She is Sooooo Busted... secret natural gas/oil deal with Russia contracted by secret company she has ownership in... bringing in 70% of fuel for the entire country... and she thought it stay a secret... of course.. Narcissistic people always think that way...
140 2018-07-11 23:47:25 Just returned home from a 5 day work trip that was in a hotel where food was served to me every few hours. There was truffle oil on basically everything. Some food had literal gold flecks on it. Now I’m having a basic salad and my body just disowned me.
141 2018-07-11 23:47:23 95% NATO countries were already on track to meet  agreed 2% by 2024. Now you extort oil/gas purchase from US and demand 4% now?  To compensate Russia you lift sanctions. Only your deplorable base will buy into this venality.
142 2018-07-11 23:47:22 And then add the popularity of EVs which will increase without a doubt in the next years to come #lithium prices per ton.
And finally, go look at all the charts of the top 10 canadian oil companies from 10-20 years ago.  Look at the SP! #Lithium is the new oil! 
Am I wrong?
143 2018-07-11 23:47:22 It’s not oil it’s natural gas. And it makes sense to get it there through the pipe line.
144 2018-07-11 23:47:13 Are you trying to say you don't do it?
145 2018-07-11 23:47:02 Here’s a wake up call. The World’s current annual energy consumption is ~ 13,500 Million toe or around 96,000 million barrels of oil equivalent. Roughly 70 % of this from oil and gas. Does @MLiebreich believe we can change this dynamic with Wind / Solar ?
146 2018-07-11 23:46:53 There's plenty of blame to go around.
147 2018-07-11 23:46:53 today’s my first day of the 30 days healthy living from Arbonne; I passed up two cupcakes, meatballs, and instead of drowning my salad in ranch, I just used oil and apple cider vinegar.. help who am I

149 2018-07-11 23:46:36 What a day! 0630 headed to airport to go home after the Part 3 weekend. Into work then onto the S100 course to marshal some unbelievable racing. Clear up an oil and get home at 2200. Unpack and sort stuff for tomorrow and this weekends trip. #shattered
150 2018-07-11 23:46:35 You've probably heard this lots so sorry if you have. All types of seizures are different. I have small ones from Lyme disease. Hand and leg trembles kinda like Parkinsons. I've used CBD oil and it helps me so much. It's supposedly legal in the US. I hope you're better soon. 
151 2018-07-11 23:46:27 I’m obsessed with green tea so a green tea & hemp oil shower gel is coming. I don’t know how I feel about the fragrance yet. It’s clean and slightly floral but my mom loves it. The over all feel of the gel is good. I have to tweak the next batch.
152 2018-07-11 23:46:23 Seductively whisper “oil rig” in her ear.
153 2018-07-11 23:46:21 *whispers* it means you need to take it in for an oil change....

158 2018-07-11 23:46:01 It's a shit show waiting to happen. Slavery. Corruption. It being an Islamist theocracy. An oil company with a seat at the UN. Added to their having no right to be there on a footballing basis. The decision to host it there was completely and utterly bizarre.
159 2018-07-11 23:45:57 Yeah oil as lube. Accurate just has become a stock phrase that gets used.

165 2018-07-11 23:45:21 Is there biological plausibility for beneficial effects of snake oil? Has there been prior studies in animals demonstrating benefit and no harm? Does snake oil have considerable less side effects than the established therapy? Is snake oil less expensive than established therapy?
166 2018-07-11 23:45:19 Germany is not a friend of western civilization. Hypocrite Merkle is doing lucrative multi-billion dollar oil and gas deals with Russia, the very same country that Germany and those other NATO countries wish to be protected from, but mainly at the expense of U.S. taxpayers.
167 2018-07-11 23:45:07 Oil changes are a hassle and sometimes we leave it longer than we should.

173 2018-07-11 23:44:35 Is it gas or oil. They are not the same thing. You know that right.
174 2018-07-11 23:44:21 Worse than fish oil?
175 2018-07-11 23:44:18 We pay our way in many other ways. We have paid with American blood in two world wars. We are the first ones called and our president is calling attention to their not paying and then going ahead with the pipeline when the U.S. could have supplied oil and gas.
176 2018-07-11 23:44:16 so sad, a lifetime of misery, I remember this homeless man, I used to see him, everyday for more than 10 years sitting on Lincoln Rd Miami Beach, the most popular street in Miami, painting & drawing for tourists with his feet...  so sad
177 2018-07-11 23:44:15 Trump has said nothing different than what was said by the last two occupants of the Oval Office re NATO contributions by NATO members; Obama also bitched about Germany/Russia oil pipeline. ONE DIFFERENCE, President Trump MEANS IT. Others said it to cover the record, that’s all.

182 2018-07-11 23:43:58 Hey, somebody has to call out a bad deal by former German Chancellor, now chairman of state-owned Russian oil giant, Shroeder's Putin friendly Nordstream pipeline(s)... again... since it was avoided between 09-16, for some reason.  Why not President La Orange McWordsalad?
183 2018-07-11 23:43:58 Merkel is answering to a right wing German man who controls the oil in Tusdia and is close with Putin.
184 2018-07-11 23:43:56 I never tire of looking at him. So today I had my oil changed in my car they have a cooler in waiting room with sodas for customers. Diet Pepsi with Michael Jackson sitting there waiting for me. I grabbed 2! I was so excited. I think I scared some kids!
185 2018-07-11 23:43:52 You heat the tip of the metal part with a mini torch. Then you can "dab" it on a dot of marijuana oil. Melts the oil then the smoke goes through water to the mouthpiece. Then inhale
186 2018-07-11 23:43:45 1.) Russia isn't "the" enemy and NATO isn't defending against Russia.
2.) Buying oil from Saudia Arabia while crying about buying oil from Russia is complete hypocrisy.
3.) The US don't lose billions on trade. You obviously don't have the slightest idea how trade actually works.
187 2018-07-11 23:43:44 Firestone tried to charge 650 to replace my girls radiator. Lucky I have solid homies who did that, replaced the brakes and changed oil all for 547.
188 2018-07-11 23:43:35 If we aim at something we are less messy. A little. That's why there are flies painted on urinals.
189 2018-07-11 23:43:33 Does that mean the US is controlled by Saudi Arabia where 17/19 of the hijackers came from & how we still buy the most Saudi oil

192 2018-07-11 23:43:00 Cont.. He popped the hood and check my oil and it was topped off well. I was so confused.  I told him the car told me my oil was only 15%.   Apparently oil has a life expectancy and mines about to die. But there's lots in there.  I'm still confused...
193 2018-07-11 23:42:57 Or the 17 million barrels of oil the US imported from Russia last year.
194 2018-07-11 23:42:56 Well, please explain how much Belmont Count road you have resurfaced lately. Then tell us how much oil & gas money you took....
195 2018-07-11 23:42:51 SORRY. CORN FIRST, OIL SECOND. YOU CAN START A FIRE IF YOU ADD OIL TO ANYTHING TO A POPCORN POPPER.
196 2018-07-11 23:42:50 Idk why I’m like just obessed with extra virgin olive oil. It’s like I put that in everything I eat. I need help 
197 2018-07-11 23:42:47 Oven roasted are the best. Olive oil, garlic, salt, and pepper. Or brush with a little honey and add panchetta or bacon....
198 2018-07-11 23:42:31 "Please say you didn't."
199 2018-07-11 23:42:16 Yes, they are in the process of importing 70% of their oil from Russia if this deal is finalized.

So not yet, but that is what is in the works. 

Are you okay with that?
200 2018-07-11 23:42:14 Living the Ina life tonight. For dinner, I made simple salads with sprouts, carrots, and broccoli; penne with oil, garlic, and roasted mini San Marzanos (Ina’s recipe); bread with oil and spices; and a bottle of Pinot Grigio, which @will_po and I are still working on. #dinner

204 2018-07-11 23:41:48 Felt like such a putz today. My new car tells me things when things go wrong. Today it told me that my oil life was at 15%.  I gasped and got my ass to a gas station to buy oil. I had a nice man help me because I didn't even know what kind of oil to buy...
205 2018-07-11 23:41:44 "Merkel is controlled by Putin cause of the oil"

Deconstruct: Accuse the other side, etc etc AND

Germany went heavily for renewables so bash the pipeline to lessen support for Germany's climate change action.

MSM still misses these things.

212 2018-07-11 23:41:19 Yes it is. Any gas that traps heat is a greenhouse gas. Don't think I'm a crazy liberal either. I work in oil and natural gas industry. Water vapor is even a greenhouse gas.

228 2018-07-11 23:40:02 Ive been lagging on doing laundry, a car wash & an oil change for 2 weeks. Everyday I wake up like today ima get it done after work but then when I’m off I just wanna eat and nap

230 2018-07-11 23:39:44 And for country like India, it matters much more than just climate change! India Buys most of its oil from middle-eastern countries and these middle eastern countries are funding Islamic clerics who spread radicalism in the sub-continent!
231 2018-07-11 23:39:43 But that’s not what he’s doing. He’s saying “oh you think I’m controlled by Russia? Well you buy oil from them.” It’s classic Trump what about-ism.
232 2018-07-11 23:39:36 Expensive US crude oil is acceptable, right? Sure!

236 2018-07-11 23:39:29 You might need to rethink this tweet. The more money Russia gets for gas and oil the more money you can borrow and Daddy Vladdy can buy you another election!!! You're not thinking these things through Donnie!
237 2018-07-11 23:39:23 Simple solution... build a wall around your country and look after yourselves.  You a-holes deserve each other!   You won’t have to worry about what the rest of the world does, and trust me... you won’t be missed!  Oh, yeah... don’t come knocking when your coal and oil run out!
238 2018-07-11 23:39:02 Angela Merkel should be extremely embarrassed that she supports Russia by buying their oil. Thank you for bringing this to our attention, I honestly had no idea.
239 2018-07-11 23:39:01 But not Germany who are 1%GDP ahead of the UK & 2%GDP ahead of all other EU countries!

Our bathroom habits are a bit quirky.
263 2018-07-11 23:36:30 First, Trump lied again - it's only 9%. Russia is the largest supplier of oil to Europe, 3rd largest LNG. The pipelines go thru Ukraine and Ukraine wants to join EU. Russia wants to take over Ukraine instead. Trump is Putin's mouthpiece.
264 2018-07-11 23:36:20 Quit divulging our man secrets. It's our source of power.

280 2018-07-11 23:34:59 The largest sources of U.S. imported oil were: Canada(40%), Saudi Arabia (11%),Venezuela (9%), Mexico (8%), and Colombia (4%). Looks like Trump wants to just ship in favor of Russia, not to mention he queried advisors on invading Venezuela.

282 2018-07-11 23:34:07 Have you ever tried neem oil ? Bit of a pungent smell but I add lavender oil to it and a pinch of turmeric..not only soothes skin but also acts as insect repellent. Had worked wonders for Margo the crazy mother..
283 2018-07-11 23:34:03 me when they buy energy from them. 3. The USA doesn’t have enough production capacity or permit request to build capacity to replace Russian oil/natural gas sales to Europe now or the next 10 yrs. 4. Putin wants to see NATO fall apart & Trump attacks on Germany help that goal

285 2018-07-11 23:34:00 If by protecting Utah’s rural economy you mean destroying public lands with mining and oil drilling you are backward thinking.
286 2018-07-11 23:33:56 @realDonaldTrump RT @ananavarro: Trump tells NATO, Germany is controlled by Russia because that’s from where Germany gets its oil.
Ok, well, by that logic....
Trump is controlled by Russia because that’s from where Trump got his presidency.
287 2018-07-11 23:33:23 pay your ticket and get an oil change dumb ass
288 2018-07-11 23:33:20 AR 600-85 explicitly bans the use of hemp products (to include hemp oil) as well as basically anything other than booze and tobacco that causes a high/intoxication/etc

Obviously if they aren't openly using it difficult to prove but if they are clear-cut Art 92 violation

291 2018-07-11 23:33:08 I think it’s obvious Big oil is more important,    He was able to use Scott Pruitt to take the heat on it.  Almost no matter what he does, even though he used to be a Democrat, he has Republican behind his name now,sorural America would vote for him again, makes sense doesn’t it?

303 2018-07-11 23:31:56 @HallieJackson So you and your crowd would have us believe that Trump's insistence that NATO members meet their funding obligations and his criticism of the Russian oil pipeline into Germany are intended to HELP Putin? Hilariously ridiculous.

317 2018-07-11 23:30:22 By undermining Russia by calling out Germany for building a pipeline so they can get 70% of their oil from Russia? How is that working for Russia?

320 2018-07-11 23:29:55 Germany is not a friend of western civilization. Hypocrite Merkle is doing lucrative multi-billion dollar oil and gas deals with Russia, the very same country that Germany and those other NATO countries wish to be protected from, but mainly at the expense of U.S. taxpayers.

323 2018-07-11 23:29:37 @cenkuygur you made some big factual mistakes in then "Torn-nato" story.

1) Nord stream 2 is a gas pipeline not an oil pipeline like Ana said.

2) Nord stream 2 is owned by Gazprom not Rosneft. So Rosneft has nothing to do with it.
324 2018-07-11 23:29:23 Why waste free labor? The PSI coming from a urethra is at least an opening salvo of a pressure wash
325 2018-07-11 23:29:08 To be fair, oil and cartel describe Russia's oil and gas industry and Gazprom pretty well, too.

328 2018-07-11 23:28:56 Or he was just calling out Germany because they won’t pay their fair share of NATO which provides security from Russia but they turned around and paid Russians billions to build an oil pipeline so that the Russians can supply them with oil. Trump is right they own them now.
329 2018-07-11 23:28:49 Ridiculous tweet  Swalwell is an Ass &yet Democrats believe lies.USA taxpayers pay to defend Germany from Russia yet Germany buys oil & becomes dependent on Russia when they could buy from USA.Germany doesn’t pay their share NATO Why should USA taxpayers pay more? Trump is right!

345 2018-07-11 23:26:22 Deutch is a Dunce.  Trump didn’t attack Germany. He attacked Merkel’s policy to pump billions of dollars into Russia for their oil. But wants US taxpayer money to defend them from Russia. Russia can cut off oil any time.  What doesn’t Dunce understand? Trump is protecting America

348 2018-07-11 23:26:14 It should have an oil life. Usually Volkswagen can go at least 5k to 10k between oil changes.
349 2018-07-11 23:26:08 Only after embodying many of these traits in my mid twenties did I realize the danger in doing so.  It is turning around an oil tanker.  It takes; time, space, and intention.  But the ocean is vast if you pick your spot correctly.  These things can be precursors to prosperity.

353 2018-07-11 23:25:57 Oil production keeps the commodity price in check!!! Hasn't given up military readiness (as per the Jt. Chiefs), holding our allies accountable is not bashing, Canada will never be our enemy, they are too dependent on the security we provide them.
354 2018-07-11 23:25:54 Picking court nominees has become a cynical process of vetting pedigree extremists. As long as the person comes from Ivy League, he must be good and pure. The public will swallow snake oil as long as the label looks good. Our justice & rights are defended by balance.
355 2018-07-11 23:25:53 Except it got us NOTHING! BUT ABUSE. THEY HAVE NOT BEEN PAYING WHAT THEY AGREED TO PAY! AND NATO EXISTS TO PROTECT FRICKN EUROPE FROM ATTACKS FROM AGGRESSORS LIKE RUSSIA- SO WHY ARE THEY ENRICHING RUSSIA BY BUYING OIL FROM RUSSIA?
356 2018-07-11 23:25:52 You should always tell those you truly care about the truth.  I just think that's a goidvlufe practice. What good does it do to blow smoke up these countries' back ends...Germany is truly in a world of hurt if Russia ever decides to cut their oil off for leverage...
357 2018-07-11 23:25:43 Is that total mortality or heart disease?

364 2018-07-11 23:24:23 The next questions should be why cant Germany pay more than the minimum 2% GPD to NATO and why can’t Germany purchase their fuel (coal, oil, natural gas) from the United States?  If Germany and Merkel consider themselves allies; they should be offended.  Fix it.
365 2018-07-11 23:24:19 roughly 70% of our country HATE trump and GOP, and are repulsed by trump supporters. 

You think it’s just coincidence or perhaps you minority 30% are getting snake oil?

Have the courage to look at yourself honestly?
366 2018-07-11 23:24:19 And somehow Trump criticizing Germany using Russian oil is going to make Russia happy. WTF?
367 2018-07-11 23:24:06 funuy trump playing a game he pro Russian but questions why germany gets oil from Russia.. what is in his drink he a nut
368 2018-07-11 23:24:04 Finding of the day: нефть /neft/ is Russian for "oil". In Latin Azeri, it's written as "naft". In Persian, it's "نفت" /naft/.

374 2018-07-11 23:23:14 Berating Germany for a back door oil deal and spending little on NATO defense is taking orders from Putin? We can safely agree critical thinking is not your thing.
375 2018-07-11 23:23:05 what is rapeseed oil though lol
376 2018-07-11 23:23:04 I’m going to need 2 tweets to respond in full. 1st, Russia supplies natural gas & oil to the EU, including Germany. They don’t control Germany, he’s lying on that. 2nd, he’s using the criticism of Germany buying energy to justify his actions w/Russia, i.e. Germany can’t judge /1
377 2018-07-11 23:23:03 No way.
How do you think we write our names in the snow?
378 2018-07-11 23:22:51 A Harvard grad actually calling someone else a limosine liberal. That's rich. Esp when big oil is a big friend of his.

388 2018-07-11 23:22:07 If you have enough energy to workout after work you probably pay to have your oil changed .
389 2018-07-11 23:21:50 Using Twitter and not burning coal not compatible . 

I'd advise you make money invest new energy research and stop virtue signaling on Twitter because unless you want to live in the 1800s oil and coal will have to be used. we all know you lunatics hate Nuclear power too .
390 2018-07-11 23:21:45 HAHAHAHA

393 2018-07-11 23:20:57 Don’t think so he makes a point a very legitimate point I might add we protect Germany for free yet the arevdoing open and brisk business w Russia. So why aren’t our oil companies doing business w Germany makes no sense
394 2018-07-11 23:20:49 It certainly will. But just say it. “I don’t care about anyone’s future but my last few years”. You win. We are starting to experience extinction on Earth. Go burn some tires in your yard. And dump your oil in the local stream.
395 2018-07-11 23:20:42 You have no idea how much of that oil/gasoline product is actually used by US military that goes into Germany do you. They use a great portion of that gas/petrol that you're ranting about. Are we paying Germany enough for that? Think on just that one simply embarrassing fact.
396 2018-07-11 23:20:33 DDT and Bald Eagle eradication, Hudson River PCBs, NEast Acid Rain deforestation, the ozone layer hole frying us, nukes...the 70's and 80's

Current status on the above?

Now, gulf horizon oil spill, Miami and NYC under water...I'm sure I'm missing a bunch
397 2018-07-11 23:20:32 We all do.  It doesn’t substitute for actual cleaning but does help
398 2018-07-11 23:20:28 And it’s a fact Russia needs the money Germany pays them for the pipeline oil. So there is no captivity, just an agreement between 2 countries.
399 2018-07-11 23:20:14 I mixed vegetable oil, shampoo, and water and dipped my razor in that to shave with and it seemed to feel smooth in maybe a fourth to a tenth of the usual seemingly infinite time.
400 2018-07-11 23:20:01 I hope you got the free oil changes for life thrown in
401 2018-07-11 23:19:53 Makes you wonder if he knows that the US imports 60% of its oil?
402 2018-07-11 23:19:47 So true lol 
403 2018-07-11 23:19:46 And since you don’t feel like changing oil so that your vehicle can remain functioning properly is necessary I assume that you will be walking for the remainder of your life
404 2018-07-11 23:19:39 is not even if they calmly put knives at "80% accuracy but tom, you use minimal oil work
405 2018-07-11 23:19:34 Please! What alliance are you talking about? They are closing their energy plants and buying their gas and oil from their “enemy”. What freaking alliance? The only reason they aren’t speaking Russian right now is because we, the USA won the Cold War!
406 2018-07-11 23:19:26 If we would have taken the oil, you wouldn't have ISIS.

Very tough to happen esp with oil above 65 imo, so really not there yet for me.
410 2018-07-11 23:19:05 Forrest Lucas uses it for lube when he wants favors from Trumpy.  Probably shares it on weekends with his terrorist bros.
411 2018-07-11 23:18:53 Considering how much money you took from Russian banks to fund your empire what does that say about you. Also, we also import oil from Russia. You know that right?

414 2018-07-11 23:18:24 Well, they should be able to do way more.
should be able to use it as shoe-shine, car polish, dishwasher soap, a decent cooking oil and lighter fluid.
415 2018-07-11 23:18:13 Oil is falling because of the onset of a trade-war - it takes a lot of oil to push cargo ships full of finished goods, subassembly parts, and raw materials across oceans.
416 2018-07-11 23:18:09 And if more rigs were in the field, where would the oil go, keep WCS lower, giving away at a discount, think bigger picture, National Energy Strategy export anywhere but the USA, get better pricing, stop using royalties to fund govt operations, stop tax giveaways
417 2018-07-11 23:18:09 It's a guy thing.
418 2018-07-11 23:18:04 It’s pretty much just canola oil.
419 2018-07-11 23:18:03 I'm home, got a craving for my chicken enchaladas, my all breast tender meat only enchaladas with block cheese and other goodies mixed in. So I'm making them now. Chicken titty tenders are a cooking white corn tortillas ready to stick into the oil. Be ready in an hour or so 
420 2018-07-11 23:18:00 The process of picking court nominees has become a cynical vetting for pedigree extremists.  As long as he is Ivy League, he must be good and pure. The public will swallow snake oil if it has the right label. Never mind justice & rights come from balance, not grinding an axe.
421 2018-07-11 23:17:56 Very proud of our POTUS and his success in the same arguments @NATO on the Russian pipeline/oil supply- John Kerry and Obama failed miserably w/ NATO on the same for years.
422 2018-07-11 23:17:44 OIL ? 
423 2018-07-11 23:17:44 There's no oil in Germany.
424 2018-07-11 23:17:32 I'm a bit scared to ask, but where does the US get it's oil from?
425 2018-07-11 23:17:28 Caps we finished up Buck Energy Services - Laredo, TX #cuernosgrande #caps #buck #texas #energy #oil #laredo #deer #embroidery #endzone  @ Poteet, Texas
426 2018-07-11 23:17:20 apply baby oil
427 2018-07-11 23:16:54 Make the American farmers growing cropps for producing Ethanol, to lower the gas prices with! Also better for the environment! And lower the oil import!
428 2018-07-11 23:16:53 If the EU was afraid of the Russian Bear, they wouldn't be buying their oil.
429 2018-07-11 23:16:41 Trump blasts Germany for buying their energy from Russia. Germany should reply ; "should we buy from Iran our gas and oil"? Donald quit your walking around with a chip on your shoulder being a fool.
430 2018-07-11 23:16:38 朝ドラ、唐突なプロポーズだけど、スズメは好きですって言ったことはあっても言われたのは初めてなんじゃないかな？初々しいなって思ったけど、体の関係もないままイケメン二人にプロポーズされるんだからやっぱドラマだなって、汚れた心を持つ大人になっちまったなって・・・
431 2018-07-11 23:16:32 Yeah i freaked out and hopped out and was just like grabbed this lil jar of coconut oil and did the deed. It was a big un and i felt so exposed
432 2018-07-11 23:16:30 Even if she was still aware of her general decency. . . Shi wouldn’t really mind that much! He’s got a heart of gold, that much has been proven already!
433 2018-07-11 23:16:30 Ima have to buy me some hair oil out here in Cali. Left home without mine. And I can not be out here hurting like that with these braids.
434 2018-07-11 23:16:25 You fill tell blind man say oil no dey for soup not salt no dey ..so without been told I know say Anu Mara over
435 2018-07-11 23:16:22 Are you expecting oil to bounce back to 75 before lowering to 67 - 68? Thank you .
436 2018-07-11 23:16:17 They even admit it has no taste by giving you garlic oil (pro tip: put the garlic on the box and put the “pizza” in the recycling bin)
437 2018-07-11 23:16:12 I got my pup a year ago. I thought I would do 1 at a time and space them out. The first one he had a horrible reaction multiple ear infections hives all over. NEVER AGAIN. If you give them good things like coconut oil, probiotics, clean water and good food.
438 2018-07-11 23:16:10 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, and patriotic citizens from all backgrounds.
439 2018-07-11 23:16:06 THIS CAR STINKS LIKE OIL. BETTER TRY TO FIX IT WITH MY FARTS AND ASS STANK. *moans involentarily*
440 2018-07-11 23:16:06 Check your Engine oil today.
441 2018-07-11 23:16:05 Bake them at 350 for 13 mins after brushing with olive oil and salt+peppering them 
442 2018-07-11 23:16:04 Ok, so we would get all our oil for energy from a dangerous enemy. Lol come on guys.. That's idiotic, so which is it? 
Putin likes America, watch his speeches over the years. The guy is not who you've been made to beleive he is.
443 2018-07-11 23:15:59 7. Use a body oil, you will shine like a queen 
8. Apply highlighter on your body
9. Use a spf!! Burnt skin is never good, and exposure to sun makes your skin age faster and dry out. Trust me, spf is more important than a fast tan.
444 2018-07-11 23:15:50 About you report some real news! Like President Trump, setting NATO straight and calling out Germany for buying oil and gas from the “evil” Russians we have to pay to defend them? That’s real news! No? Crickets? 
445 2018-07-11 23:15:46 Stir together 4 cups catfish with 2 quarts ice cream. Adorn with  Olive Oil. Stir-fry. Serve with chili
446 2018-07-11 23:15:45 I should've just said up front - getting Germany to pay more into NATO and criticizing Germany-Russia oil deals doesn't help Putin at all and it doesn't support the BS Russia-Trump Collusion theory. It does just the opposite.
447 2018-07-11 23:15:36 Y’all think I’m just joking about Maca Root, but trust me...when that maca root nut be coming out like coconut oil
448 2018-07-11 23:15:36 Not usually a fan of kale, but douse it with old fryer oil? !! So inspired!
449 2018-07-11 23:15:32 blanca padilla said that she uses coconut oil as a body moisturizer i think i'm finally going to try it myself
450 2018-07-11 23:15:31 Yes ma’am. When I did mine I put on my face neck n chest. Just so happened to have a eczema flare I mighta treated with topical steroids later that week and it cleared up in two days. And often my eczema starts as a heat rash. Just get you some powdered turmeric honey n a oil
451 2018-07-11 23:15:26 “I am actually. Ben Solo” He extended his hand “Solo Oil. Its.. well it’s my Father’s company. I’m sure he’d love to have a race car to sponsor.”
452 2018-07-11 23:15:22 If I get a nose job can they remove my oil glands too? I produce way too much oil... saddening...
453 2018-07-11 23:15:22 The more you train the oil, the stronger it will get.
454 2018-07-11 23:14:57 Kerry is the biggest coward of any Sec State.  It's time America STOPPED financing the World.  Pay up or don't look to us for support.  Dont take oil from Russia then expect us to defend you against Russia.  #MAGA
455 2018-07-11 23:14:55 There are unconfirmed reports that the french #Cameroun army has retreated from Ekondo Titi in the #SouthernCameroons. The area is known for its palm oil plantations. @jokraniareflex1 @marcel_lucht @eliesmith @USEmbYaounde
456 2018-07-11 23:14:51 Good luck tomorrow night
457 2018-07-11 23:14:39 He is jealous of her.  She and Obama were close. Tx oil boys told Trump 2 get them more German contracts 4 oil/gas. Putin appreciated Donald's help in giving fake news talking points to Merkel's opposition -20% (not 60/70% per Trump) of Germany's energy is Russian gas/oil.
458 2018-07-11 23:14:39 It is interesting to note that President Trump warned Germany and the European Union of the dangers associated with accepting oil and gas from a Russian pipeline. If Trump works for Putin then why would Putin have Trump warn Europe of the danger Russia presents to Europe?
459 2018-07-11 23:14:37 You know what I wish was free? Fucking oil changes
460 2018-07-11 23:14:36 雨の時に冷房ケチるのヤメロォ！！
461 2018-07-11 23:14:31 Where is the “Treason” choice, Snake Oil?
462 2018-07-11 23:14:18 Make sure to use mostly matte products and don't forget even if you have oily skin you should moisturize before applying makeup. Have you tried maybe an oil controlling primer?
463 2018-07-11 23:14:15 Roasted with some olive oil and sea salt is  too
464 2018-07-11 23:14:15 Was Rockefeller any better though? The depredations of Standard Oil. He constantly flouted govt & crushed his competitors mercilessly: for e.g., underpricing them by illegally getting info about all oil they shipped. He was arguably America's most hated businessman of the 1900s.
465 2018-07-11 23:14:11 クソゲロ暑い
466 2018-07-11 23:13:55 Oil change 
467 2018-07-11 23:13:54 Let me get this straight...
Trump is Putin’s puppet yet Trump wants NATO to increase military spending to 2%.  When I went to school Europe was closer to Russia than the U.S. (hah) and slams Germany for relying on Russian oil... who’s the puppet?
468 2018-07-11 23:13:35 @marthamaccallum you cannot trust German govt as their companies do business in Iran when they are supposed be America's allies, they work with Russia for oil and gas, again they are supposed to be allies of America. Time to end Nato and support of the Eu who are self serving
469 2018-07-11 23:13:33 @DIVACANDICEM  Baoboseed Oil Diggitta can cure you try consuming it....maybe bath cold water cold warm...
470 2018-07-11 23:13:28 So Germany buys gas and oil from Russia then Germany increases defense force to protect from Russian incursion that they have funded by gas and oil #NATO #NATOSummit
471 2018-07-11 23:13:17 This one brain they lick oil ooo.
Head filled with relaxer 
472 2018-07-11 23:13:04 @FoxNews WWII, energy (oil), and Japan. Ask the Japanese about energy reliance.  Stop airing people who do no homework please.
473 2018-07-11 23:13:00 CASTOR OIL EVERY NIGHT. PUT IT ON WITH AN UNUSED MASCARA WAND & SLEEP WITH IT
474 2018-07-11 23:12:50 Apply castor oil w a spooly on them!!
475 2018-07-11 23:12:45 big oof
476 2018-07-11 23:12:43 Oil cleansing method w/ grape seed oil, thayers cucumber witch hazel, bamboo face rags, add ACV to my clay  mask & do 3x/week, moisturize w/ rosehip oil
477 2018-07-11 23:12:38 Wah mek some banana fritters but a bay spray oil mi have
478 2018-07-11 23:12:25 Also I like to bring an essential oil blend of lemon, lavender, and peppermint because if you put a few drops in your hands and breath in, it kind of clears the stuffy air. Also podcasts because you can make those offline.
479 2018-07-11 23:12:15 Mushroom gnocchi w fresh garlic, tomatoes, onions & olive oil  wet
480 2018-07-11 23:12:02 Yea sure, thats why he questioned gemany about relying on russian oil to much, he said russia owned germany because of it
481 2018-07-11 23:11:46 早いな笑
お疲れさん

その調子で150ccも行ってしまおう笑
俺いま150ccで☆3取れなくて練習してるわ笑笑
482 2018-07-11 23:11:45 Chicken fried steak.  Pounded out thin.  I mean real thin. Tossed in flour batter and fried in HOT oil.  The steak should be crispy throughout.  Garden salad with ranch, fried okra, mashed potatoes.
483 2018-07-11 23:11:42 Trump scolds Nato for allowing Germany to be captive to Russia for their oil
Schumer & Pelosi say: "Disturbing how President is more loyal to President Putin than to our NATO allies”  OMG! Are Democrats so gullable to believe such nonsense? Whats necessary, to declare WAR?
#MAGA
484 2018-07-11 23:11:36 600 billion is about the total US military budget (excluding various nuts outside the DOD), not just NATO related parts. Germany could get by without Russian energy sources I think. They have a lot of non fossil fuel energy, although they need the oil for transportation right now
485 2018-07-11 23:11:29 Parliament,
A palour ent,
Blood thicker than water,
But oil thicker than blood.
-Jab Jab riots
486 2018-07-11 23:11:11 Hell, Shi probably won’t understand it-

As an Android? Some of her human. . . ‘Decency’ no longer exists-
487 2018-07-11 23:11:11 Yeah this is basically My life theme.
488 2018-07-11 23:11:06 I have one question was anything President Trump said about German oil imports and NATO payments incorrect?
489 2018-07-11 23:11:02 It's a 2-door Cooper S. It uses synthetic oil, so I only need to get that changed once a year. YMMV - literally, b/c you may put more miles on your car than I do. It's getting old now, and requires more annual upkeep, but a trip to the garage once a year takes care of everything.
490 2018-07-11 23:10:54 Standard Oil Company se adueñó del mercado hasta 1911,cuando el Congreso declaró ilegales sus actividades por violar las leyes antimonopolio.
491 2018-07-11 23:10:48 Ted Cruz is getting a run for his money in TX by someone who could eat his lunch. Cruz will probably win b/c well b/c TX is highly gerrymandered and he's got big oil in his pocket.
492 2018-07-11 23:10:41 ヴィルヘルムとあの眼鏡のにーさんとまた飲みたいなー
493 2018-07-11 23:10:35 John D. Rockefeller fue el fundador y presidente de la Standard Oil, compañía que monopolizó la extracción del petróleo de Estados Unidos.
494 2018-07-11 23:10:30 OMG!!! SHES the one buying Russian nat gas and oil, while the USA is footing the bill to protect her country......FROM RUSSIA!!!  WAKE TF UP!
495 2018-07-11 23:10:28 Awesome!
496 2018-07-11 23:10:27 When you have a shit-ton surplus of cheap grain for @Russia to make vodka, who gives a shit?! Nat gas & oil is Vital NatSec commodities. @USAFacts #LameComeback
497 2018-07-11 23:10:19 僕はただ油にこんにちはを言う練習をする。
498 2018-07-11 23:10:13 I think that’s generally due to low commodity price too. beyond oil, everything else is at its lows. (Natural gas, uranium, etc)
Electricity is cheap...
499 2018-07-11 23:10:12 マッチョ見に行きたかった……
500 2018-07-11 23:10:09 bring down(하락시키다) : The latest news brought down oil prices. 최근의 뉴스가 유가를 떨어뜨렸다.
501 2018-07-11 23:10:07 @hardball only problem with that analysis is that Trump isn’t buuu g 70% oil our energy from our enemy Russia. Like Germany is funding our enemy.....
502 2018-07-11 23:10:03 Hmm but just the thought of all those succulent asses just glistening from all that oil 
503 2018-07-11 23:09:59 Avocado with olive oil, salt and pepper 
504 2018-07-11 23:09:56 見るだけじゃなくて15人目目指すとか？
505 2018-07-11 23:09:54 Not a everyday use kind of oil and I meant “dilute” not “diffuse”
506 2018-07-11 23:09:51 Besides chicks of course.
507 2018-07-11 23:09:38 Most of the countries in that list don’t  even have oil and Gas exploration, so BC being were it’s at I would say it’s pretty damn good. As far as spouting off. I work in the industry, I know first hand what is envolved in protecting the Enviroment and the standards we strive for
508 2018-07-11 23:09:37 @HardballChris you're a f****** douchebag.... just because your boy Obama wouldn't stand up to other countries doesn't mean we need to be pussies about it... Germany relies on Russia for natural gas and oil, what happens when their worst enemy who is Russia turns off the tap.
509 2018-07-11 23:09:37 Just like some are suggesting... sprouts cooked in some oil, garlic, bacon, salt and pepper in a cast iron? #3hunna
510 2018-07-11 23:09:34 You know,whatever happened to ppl drove to/from work 6-9 AM & 4-7 PM but aside from that, roads were relatively clear;now roads are never clear &everyone screaming CC/CO2 ignore they use gas needlessly &their waste indebts us to mideast oil.
511 2018-07-11 23:09:22 @ChrisCuomo does Canada not provide a pipeline of resources to the US?  Do the Saudi's not provide oil to the west?  Just a thought
512 2018-07-11 23:09:20 The results are overflowing in one direction.
513 2018-07-11 23:09:14 and usa gets lots of oil,gas & electricity from Canada & dumpty wants to do everything in his power to go against them, what an idiot
514 2018-07-11 23:09:11 Translation:  Merkel is realizing that Germany has to pay their fair share and stop buying oil from the country the US (via NATO) is protecting them from.
515 2018-07-11 23:09:06 @laurasidea Your dishes are delicious, and I'm glad most are vegan. But could you not claim they're all healthy? E.g. coconut oil/sugar and agave nectar are unhealthy. Or you could hire a registered dietitian (not nutritionist), instead of reinforcing false popular believes.
516 2018-07-11 23:08:52  Can’t believe that people are surprised when the police have to intervene...
517 2018-07-11 23:08:50 Scrambled Egg + Rice + Soy Sauce +Olive Oil = Heavenly Breakfast 
518 2018-07-11 23:08:49 Why is Quaker Steak and Lube not a dine-in oil change venue. Why.
519 2018-07-11 23:08:31 I’m getting my oil changed right now and I’m stuck in the lobby area that is HOT AF and I’m dying 
520 2018-07-11 23:08:23 @realDonaldTrump   Russia is captive to Germany since Russia depends on energy exports to survive.  NOBODY buys anything else made in Russia except the US buying Russian titanium. Russia has nothing anyone wants except gas, oil and titanium. SAD!
521 2018-07-11 23:08:23 We benefit some yes but NATO was set up to counter the USSR when thousands upon thousand of tanks alone were poised to attack at any time. Russia is what left of the USSR and is rearming with oil sales from our allies while we shove money up China's ass by the train load. Shit
522 2018-07-11 23:08:20 Yeah, I get the idea that it’s a thick oil or something. Thanks
523 2018-07-11 23:08:19 Your forgetting that Germany also imports about 40%  of its oil from Russia, and 30% of coal
The combination of infrastructure needed to bring these fuels into Germany from Russian makes them dependent
Also way the former German chancellor now works for Russian energy commission
524 2018-07-11 23:08:08 Stronger $USD has sent $AUD, Oil, Gold, and base metal commodities in retreat today (all measured in $USD of course). Foreign investment from the US has been seen in June for the first time in a long time. Expect more in our financials.
525 2018-07-11 23:08:01 Don't be so leftists ignorant please. You Germans are crying wolf about Russia as no 1 enemy and you are buying their gas. How stupid and not credible is that? It is like NATO goes to war against Russia but needs Russian oil for their tanks and fighter jets.
526 2018-07-11 23:07:58 China has a real problem.  If we start making stuff here they will be screwed forever.  Once people get a taste for high tech manufacturing it will never go back to China. Saudi Arabia tried to put our oil guys out of business and they lost. Watch what will happen with mfg.
527 2018-07-11 23:07:50 We will need a miracle. Like discovery of huge oil reserves. Oops wrong example; then the petrol price will go up again because our oil will be sold at $28 per barrel to some benefactor.
528 2018-07-11 23:07:47 Oil change 
529 2018-07-11 23:07:29 You all have it a$$ backwards! NATO NEEDS THE US TO PROTECT THEM IN EUROPE! FROM AGGRESSORS LIKE RUSSIA...THEN THEY DON'T PAY THE AGREED UPON 2%OF THEIR GDP ..... PLUS BUYING OIL FROM...RUSSIA...PLUS GERMANY ALLOWING A PIPELINE THRU THEIR COUNTRY! 2 BRING IT IN! ....SERIOUSLY?
530 2018-07-11 23:07:26 Good! After all, Shi thinks he’s nice! He’s a kindhearted guy!
531 2018-07-11 23:07:23 Hey @POTUS why are you twitting during the NATO summit?  Do your job and act like a President of the US.  Also where is all that extra oil you said was coming from Saudi Arabia?  Prices jumped 30 cents here today.  Must be your friends getting richer off the extra oil.
532 2018-07-11 23:07:11 oh fuck 
533 2018-07-11 23:06:56 Nothing like going to get my oil changed and discovering that rats/mice built a nest in my engine while I was on vacation. 
534 2018-07-11 23:06:37 How about the huge pipeline Russia has to Germany for oil and gas? When Canada should open up a big pipeline to eastern Canada?? Get it together Trudy Trudeau!
535 2018-07-11 23:06:33 can you obtain a THC/CBD oil? they both work together for pain relief. i would suggest 10 mg THC and 100 mg CBD to start
536 2018-07-11 23:05:52 My local vape shop has CBD oil. Curious, can I just buy it from them with no “script”?
537 2018-07-11 23:05:52 No need to make up the difference bring the hammer down we must only pay our part that’s it let them worry about the rest they’re using our money to buy oil from Russia must stop now
538 2018-07-11 23:05:45 Because Germany can afford to fund Nato and doesn’t and instead strengthens Nato’s primary, if not exclusive adversary, Russia by buying their oil and gas from Russia at the detriment of Nato’s eastern european members.
539 2018-07-11 23:05:40 What does that say about you and US paying for all that oil from the Saudis - the same people who sent us terrorists!?!!
540 2018-07-11 23:05:34 You did not know this about men?
541 2018-07-11 23:05:25 tea tree oil
542 2018-07-11 23:05:24 Yep hypocrisy the oil that keeps Little Britain together
543 2018-07-11 23:05:17 The part I was referring to was when he said something to the effect of Russia owning Germany because of the oil the Germans buy from Russia.  In today's political climate it seems we attack first instead of trying to have civil conversations.  Both parties need to work together.
544 2018-07-11 23:04:55 I might smell like weed and disappointment but you smell like tanning oil and daddy issues
545 2018-07-11 23:04:54 And don't forget flushing early so you can aim down the vortex
546 2018-07-11 23:04:47 Brag the Cons would have taken the most drastic tactic first??? Really, that's pathetic if that's all you Cons can hang your hat on. Fact is nearly 50 years of Cons rule in AB and the infrastructure was not created to earn properly off our Oil resources.
547 2018-07-11 23:04:35 Sabi ng kaklase ko kung papaltan daw namin oil pastel nya, nagpahiram pa ayaw pala mabawasan,  bigay ko sayo yung akin 
548 2018-07-11 23:04:24 I heard coconut oil is bad for hair, I use it for only my skin (including face), now it’s bad for skin too. I developed blackheads or pimples whatever last year and I’ve been struggling since. Chai, I guess I’ll start using avocado oil or/and carrot oil now.
549 2018-07-11 23:04:19 So while we'll continue to negotiate with Russia, that's the score. And it makes a lot of sense to express our displeasure about Germany doing lucrative oil deals with Russia, when we may have to exert stronger sanctions against in the Russia in the not so distant future.
550 2018-07-11 23:04:17 who sell the likkle THC oil smoke pens?
551 2018-07-11 23:04:15 He’s a sales man flogging US oil
552 2018-07-11 23:04:13 Should he have just agreed to just pay for all like you would? Face it you're out and no one wants your opinion! After the Iran BS deal you really shouldn't be measuring anyone else's success although I'm not sure you know what that is! Do you think Germany getting all oil f Rus?
553 2018-07-11 23:04:13 Besides it shows a level of skill.
554 2018-07-11 23:04:12 I love my service truck! 340K miles, awesome compression, doesn't leak a drop of oil...besides, Ill never find a truck that'll take that utility topper again! C'mon 500K! 
555 2018-07-11 23:04:07 @hardball so Trump trying to make nato raise more money to fight Putin and Russia is tearing nato apart. Really??? And Trump saying that Germany shouldn’t buy Russian oil and not make Russia richer is playing to Putin?????
556 2018-07-11 23:04:03 Yes I like that neon 3. Its sweet man. Good luck this weekend
557 2018-07-11 23:04:00 That being said... Apparently you are an oil fan, so.. like, I'm not sure we should be talking.  
558 2018-07-11 23:03:39 #BeefTallowFrenchFries  Why eat fat at all if it doesn’t add flavor? Experts say (S Renaud Public Health Nutr. 2001 Apr;4(2B):459-74) up to 8% of daily calories as saturated fat is ideal.  Vegetable oil is just a by-product of the animal-feed industry.  Vive les frites!
559 2018-07-11 23:03:37 Thank the universe for CBD oil 
560 2018-07-11 23:03:32 I'll just pop to my cupboard and get my seaweed and dulse oil out, oh and the scallops from the fridge.
561 2018-07-11 23:03:29 Lowest in Canada but no company’s pay that. Oil company’s pay 18 starting so everywhere else subway Walmart ect pay 16-18 starting
562 2018-07-11 23:03:18 I need some more raw coconut oil
563 2018-07-11 23:03:10 Someone, please explain to @potus the difference between corporate money & government money. German energy companies (businesses) buy Russian oil  from Russian companies (businesses). Corporate money doesn't equal government money, @jaketapper @donlemon @theview @theview
564 2018-07-11 23:02:58 Try mixing it up with some other art practice. Sign up to a painting course at a local college and whip out the gouache, sculpt, oil paint, water colour, however you do it put yourself way out of your comfort zone! Being around others creating may be a help :)
565 2018-07-11 23:02:44 Why did you tell half story and interject your personal "feelings" into reporting. Germany wants protected from Russia while purchasing billions in oil from Russia.German shut down their nuclear reactors(greenies concern); and will now be energy dependent on R.
566 2018-07-11 23:02:42 THE LENS OF US PAYING THERE WAY IN NATO..... OR THE LENS S OF US DEFNEDING THEM WHILE THEY BUY THERE OIL FROM RUSSIA
567 2018-07-11 23:02:41 Nothing like a fr3$h oil change
568 2018-07-11 23:02:40 一番搾り！

570 2018-07-11 23:02:22 What we mixing in the oil diffuser tonight boys?
571 2018-07-11 23:02:09 Oh it’s OK for Don to side with Russians over our country but not ok for Germany to purchase gas when we are one of Russia’s major trading partners and it is yes you got it Crude Oil and crude Oil products! Angela Merkel tell the lying guy with Orange Hair and Skin to take a walk
572 2018-07-11 23:02:04 If he wrecks it he has to buy it
573 2018-07-11 23:02:00 Y’all know how to change ur oil and tires?
574 2018-07-11 23:01:44 come to think of it this explains a lot of his behavoir and the stages. sonic is basically an assassin sent in to destabilize the supply chain (oil ocean, chemical plant, ect) of a warlord
575 2018-07-11 23:01:43 Plus they are becoming very dependent upon Russia because of oil imports, which Trump is blasting them for.  Still dems’ narrative is Trump favors Putin.  Go figure.
576 2018-07-11 23:01:41 I did warn you I was the worst oil trader in the world
577 2018-07-11 23:01:33 from what i remember:

- 1 tbsp honey (i'd use more tho, maybe 3 or 4)
- 1/2 cup brown sugar
- couple dashes of cinnamon
- 3 tbsp olive oil (but i would use less looking back)
- 1 tbsp uncooked oats

bada bing bada boom enjoy
578 2018-07-11 23:01:19 How much have we paid the Saudi's for oil does that make us terrorists
579 2018-07-11 23:01:18 The truck looks damn good!
580 2018-07-11 23:01:12 Many more of these stories that never get told than the bad ones that get headlines and viral views. true.
581 2018-07-11 23:01:11 ICJ issued an advisory opinion today.  Not a legal ruling.  It has no power.  UN is bought & paid for by muslim countries & their oil.  Judea & Samaria arent occupied.  Israel accepted title of beligerant occupation when it thought it wld turn it over 4 . Tht time has passed.
582 2018-07-11 23:01:10 Another liberal bot idiot that doesn't know the first thing about the oil industry but regurgitates leftist, environmentalist lies to promote a self-centered agenda.  Probably doesn't pay CA state taxes either.
583 2018-07-11 23:01:08 ......and also a lesson on building your industry being a critical aspect of socialism and related systems. Sweden can do what they do because their industries were mostly intact in WWII. Venezuela didn't build theirs up with all the oil money they had
584 2018-07-11 23:01:06 ... y 'with a little oil' no quiere decir que la sartén cocine con poco aceite, sino con aceitito. ¡Qué mona la sartén! Me la pido.
585 2018-07-11 23:01:01 Commander in chimp trump: "germany is totally controlled by russia."

president McTrumpcake said it unfair to MURICA'N taxpayers that germany buys oil and gas from Vodka land while enjoying the umbrella of defense provided by u.s. dollars.
586 2018-07-11 23:00:59 We bought oil from Russia during the COLD WAR. We buy shit from our arguably most important military competitor China all the time. He signaled he wants to lift sanctions to allow our oil companies back into Russia. He is an imbecile and hypocrite.  He also hates women leaders.
587 2018-07-11 23:00:58 none of the above, take a deep dive into how Cannabas Oil heals the body. #bodyhascannabinoidsystem...

590 2018-07-11 23:00:45 So I was just complaining about how I didn’t want to pay for an oil change because I planned on getting my hair done.  My mom called me and told me I had a check for $50 in the mail today . Won’t he do it?

598 2018-07-11 23:00:05 @spanishcvndy hey so I use a mix of aloe, witch hazel & tea tree oil on a cotton bad and put it on my acne and that helps a lot (especially with my back and chest)
599 2018-07-11 23:00:01 HE’D BETTER NOT DIE.

SHARK BOI IS PRECIOUS, TOO-
600 2018-07-11 22:59:58 All I got to do is mix the oil with steal and a gas made from strict nature I guess then I'll have diamond steal the mixture sent sun yet cuz of money
601 2018-07-11 22:59:55 Don’t use Mike Hudema for a source of information. He is paid to propagandize and he does it well. False I formation abounds with him and Greenpeace. Follow Vivian Krause. She has followed the money for a decade that is used to slander and attack Canada’s oil industry.
602 2018-07-11 22:59:50 You would not have the nuclear turbines spinning in reserve.  Who cares about relying on Quebec if it means affordable clean energy. It is still a part of Canada You rely on other Canadian markets for natural gas, oil, propane diesel,and gasoline.
603 2018-07-11 22:59:49 Its coming home in 3 and half years time when they win it on the oil boys home patch
604 2018-07-11 22:59:45 Llegó a River una propuesta de una empresa para ofrecerse como Sponsor en la camiseta. 
Es de Oil Combustible, la están analizando
605 2018-07-11 22:59:17 Um... how much money has been spent subsidizing oil and nuclear then compare it to Wind & Solar
606 2018-07-11 22:59:00 Who first figured out whale oil would burn?

Like, were they setting fire to every dead animal to check?
607 2018-07-11 22:58:57 yes, so let's do it with oil from clean sources, not tarsands muck which is ruining giant swaths of alberta and poisoning billions of litres of clean water while turning the boreal forest into a lunar colony
608 2018-07-11 22:58:54 Lucas Oil = tossers. 
609 2018-07-11 22:58:34 Who made the oil deal with Russia???? GERMANY!!!
610 2018-07-11 22:58:29 @rubytuesday is awful. Got charged $14 for a piece of ok chicken and oil soaked zucchini.... meal was supposed to be 2 pieces of chicken and 2 sides for $16
611 2018-07-11 22:58:25 So you think it’s fair we pay for Germany’s defense against Russia and they in turn cut billion dollar oil pipeline deals with Russia? I’m curious.
612 2018-07-11 22:58:22 Damn you! Lol
613 2018-07-11 22:58:18 Merkel is the head of company that owns the pipelines she just purchased 70% of oil and gas from Russia. They want help to protect them from Russia but deals with Russia to own 70%.
614 2018-07-11 22:58:18 Also, my ma-in-law makes this potato salad I think about all the time. Potatoes. Very lightly cooked yellow onion.  Red wine vinegar. S&p. Maybe some olive oil
615 2018-07-11 22:57:54 Only grilled with bacon onions and olive oil 
616 2018-07-11 22:57:54 And let's speak frankly, you're just jealous b/c you want in on the deal with Russian oil. It's why Rex Tillerson was your first Secretary of State. So cut it with the theatrics, you gold-plated tin-pot dictator wannabe.
617 2018-07-11 22:57:49 Black, with a sheen in sunlight like oil on water.
618 2018-07-11 22:57:49 I saw them gremlins running out of that truck! It's going to be a great weekend!
619 2018-07-11 22:57:37 And the US gets oil from Saudi Arabia. Remember them? The ones that took down the World Trade Center.
620 2018-07-11 22:57:27 Even Putin is like, slow down, Donaldinko, we like the gas and oil money.
621 2018-07-11 22:57:13 If Trump is in "cahoots" with Putin, then why would he blast Germany for buying oil and gas from Russia? Then, encourage other world leaders not do to the same?
622 2018-07-11 22:57:00 Also, the dogs here in Rome that I’ve met (about 40 of them - I know, not a ton but I’m on foot) are sooo well-behaved and zen. Is it the olive oil? The pasta? TELL ME EVERYTHING! #WhatIsYourSecretItaly?
623 2018-07-11 22:56:59 theres a special place in hell for the person that decided to oil and chip all these roads 
624 2018-07-11 22:56:51 Finally bought myself oil, I’m happy
625 2018-07-11 22:56:49 U care@ duplicitous German Gov tht dsn't pay their fair share fr NATO DEF,rails against Jerusalem recognized capital of Israel,does deals w/Russia fr oil&gas,then contends tht Russia is threatening EU,thn U do @ U.S., how mch we pay,tht we r nt going to B walked over

626 2018-07-11 22:56:43 Cut them in half, toss them in Olive oil, add salt, pepper and chopped bacon and cook them flat side down in a cast iron skillet. Not too bad!
627 2018-07-11 22:56:41 straight men and good conversation are like oil and water
628 2018-07-11 22:56:16 Sounds like a waste of time show vote. Don’t you guys have better things to do with more substance? Sounded to me like Trump was asking Germany to not buy Russian oil while we are paying to protect them.
629 2018-07-11 22:56:13 Suddenly, instead of "caraway", it's written "araway".
Adds "nutmeg", "oil" and "ur deepest love" to the ingredients just to spell on the first letters "no u"

Stoically gives it back
630 2018-07-11 22:56:05 In step order of using! Like you would use oil cleanser and then foam etc but if you want to skip around you can!
631 2018-07-11 22:56:02 Hahah take ur oil
632 2018-07-11 22:55:52 Or how oil works, even.
633 2018-07-11 22:55:50 We also do it in the shower and then claim we didn’t.

635 2018-07-11 22:55:40 banana boat? more like "oil boat"
636 2018-07-11 22:55:31 #MrLube I loved you guys when you were a lube shop - now that your a tire shop (that might do oil changes in the side) seems like getting an oil change means a one hour or more wait.  
637 2018-07-11 22:55:20 You’re incorrect with your numbers, also the U.S has greater needs than our allies.  Trump always has and always will inflate his numbers. Germany is purchasing oil from Russia because it is more economical, not because they have been bought by putin.
638 2018-07-11 22:55:15 Just put oil based makeup remover in my hair instead of straightening oil... 
Yup, goodnight.
639 2018-07-11 22:55:04 shaving with olive oil - actually a game changer
640 2018-07-11 22:55:02 No one tells me when to sleep, or when to drive. I operate within the constraints imposed upon me as I choose.
641 2018-07-11 22:54:55 Hello I’m covered in coconut oil
642 2018-07-11 22:54:47 Curly hair problems is when you condition and put that $30 argan oil in your hair, go outside for 5 minutes and come back inside all dry and frizzy and shit.
643 2018-07-11 22:54:42 Hobbles onto the TL, covered on ash and oil.

It had been a long day in the laboratory.
644 2018-07-11 22:54:40 I ate something with Oliva oil and now I want to vomit it.
645 2018-07-11 22:54:34 So @timkaine I guess you are ok with Virginia taxpayers paying for Germany’s defense while they buy oil and gas from Russia and not from another NATO member. And you’re probably ok with them charging unfair tariffs on imported American made cars. Speak up! Tell me where you stand
646 2018-07-11 22:54:34 Tbh R&D on seasoning in a japan company ain’t easy. I gotta grind the oil and spices with a mortar and all the entire day it’s so tiring. And it’s only been 3 weeks. I have 9 more to go
647 2018-07-11 22:54:31 Well, to her defense, have you seen how much an oil change is lately....
648 2018-07-11 22:54:27 yes i have a lot of flare ups on my back!! it gets so itchy and dry. so after showering i moisturize it with the oil and it hasn’t been itchy at all and it’s clearing up 
649 2018-07-11 22:54:23 For silky hair, mix 3 parts olive oil and 1 part honey. Put in microwave 30 sec. Apply to damp hair 20 mins with shower cap on. Rinse well!
650 2018-07-11 22:54:19 How does getting NATO members to spend more on defense destroy NATO?

We foot the bill for 50,000 troops in Germany to protect them from Russia..... and they go buy Russian oil and gas!

That's absurd.
651 2018-07-11 22:54:16 寝れるわけもない笑
652 2018-07-11 22:54:14 Germany doesn't want to burn coal; shutting down its coal plants so it can claim to be GREEN. So to offset coal, #Germany imports more oil & natural gas from Russia, using monies it saved from not paying it's fair share of #NATO defense costs. It's a scam! Shame on Merkel. #Trump
653 2018-07-11 22:54:08 โอ้ยยย ลุง
654 2018-07-11 22:54:05 What if I'm tired at 7hrs and want to sleep? I can't stop and sleep for 3 and add that to back end. The law says I am tired at 11.

663 2018-07-11 22:53:42 I told my boss that I needed an oil change and he paid for it :,) i love my job lol
664 2018-07-11 22:53:23 Probably charge them with: poor magazine spring maintenance, and lack of proper barrel oil. “Ma’am you is gonna need to maintain your firearm better, and keep aholt of it, what if a prowler jumpt outta the poo stall, when ya set er’ down?”
665 2018-07-11 22:53:18 Germany gets only 9% of its gas/oil from Russia!! Trump doesn’t understand NATO or its funding!because he chooses to spend a huge portion of budget on military it doesn’t mean everyone has to! It’s UP to 2% of a countries budget!! Not to NATO!
666 2018-07-11 22:52:57 @Jakewim say bro, you gotta check the oil.
667 2018-07-11 22:52:46 My boyfriend laughed when I asked where the "oil hole" was in my car. I am a 20 year old girl my hobbies are Netflix and Chipotle, not fixing up my 2012 Kia Soul thank you
668 2018-07-11 22:52:41 Unpopular opinion getting rid of straws isnt the solution to pollution or water and wildlife n all that. If y’all want to make a change change the power of big oil companies, just spitballing. Some people literally can’t drink without straws fyi
669 2018-07-11 22:52:33 this mua i follow said his skin care routine is dawn dish soap and rose hip oil. give me one reason why i shouldnt end it all right now
670 2018-07-11 22:52:19 I'll just let the oil to heat up for 30 min then .. also thank God I'll be home alone so if I flop I'll just tose them in the bin and keep it moving 
671 2018-07-11 22:52:19 Europe is supporting Russia by buying their oil and natural gas, but want this country to keep paying for the defense of Europe. Do you agree with Europe?
672 2018-07-11 22:52:10 Maybe Germany could get oil and gas from Canada, an ally. Oops, we don’t have the pipelines to get it to tidewater! How silly is that.
673 2018-07-11 22:52:09 It's so awful here too! I bought some peppermint oil, and it really helps. I put a couple of drops on the bottom of each foot, and within a few minutes I'm completely cooled off! 
674 2018-07-11 22:51:58 I'll be watching hope you have a great time,safe race ,and try to stay cool. Good luck.
675 2018-07-11 22:51:58 Just used an old wet wipe from Buffalo Wild Wings to wipe the oil off my face because I’m losing control of my life
676 2018-07-11 22:51:57 I just got hella irritated out of nowhere. This oil hojr need to fly by cause no
677 2018-07-11 22:51:55 Attacking grammar is a no go. Lol. No. NOT putting world market aside.. ramos deregulated oil industry during his tenure, world market prices play a key factor, we cannot out that aside and blame the train law ALONE
678 2018-07-11 22:51:53 Putin doesn't care about oil. Putin just wants an originalist SCOTUS.
679 2018-07-11 22:51:50 washing my hair is so therapeutic... get all that shit on there.... coconut.... jojoba.... shea butter... argan oil... evoo.... get all that shit on there.... wash the bullshit away

682 2018-07-11 22:51:31 Merkel,  Germany Chancellor actually feel American people are stupid.  We protect Germany from Russia with lg American Troop commitment while Germany purchases billions Dollars from Russia  for their oil. Trump told Germany pay for American Troops & purchase oil from USA.

687 2018-07-11 22:51:04 #1 supplier of oil is Canada and has been for any years. US was weaned off the Saudi oil, but they are still a supplier, just not #1 anymore. Trump is right about Germany.
688 2018-07-11 22:51:02 Err the USA import most of their oil from Mexico 
689 2018-07-11 22:50:58 I'm in the oil industry so I'm constantly watching the Nymex Market all day
690 2018-07-11 22:50:55 A lot of Dems are attacking Trump because he “attacked our allies at NATO”

Sorry, but “allies” don’t steal from you, take advantage of you, and get all their oil from Russia. Trump won’t bend over for our “allies” like Obama did.

692 2018-07-11 22:50:43 The tricky part is getting the temperature of the oil right to make sure they cook inside  also because it’s your first time make them small not small small but small

694 2018-07-11 22:50:38 We’re not beholden to ME, but we don’t get a majority of our energy from there. If we did, we’d be at their mercy. In fact, US net oil imports are the lowest since data available starting 45 years ago. We are actually selling our higher grade oil to the UAE.
695 2018-07-11 22:50:31 We buy oil from Canada and the Saudis who sponsored 9/11.The Petroleum Institute says that at full capacity the pipeline will provide a single digit source for Germany.

697 2018-07-11 22:50:25 That's just fine Nancy. I'm glad you've committed this to Twitter. In a decade or so when your grandkids wonder how things got so bad for your country they'll know people like Gran put their faith in a snake oil salesmen whose been a con artist since the 80s.

702 2018-07-11 22:49:44 There's an ad for Pirelli tires now which is just a yellow stiletto heel pressing down on an accelerator. All I can think of is Rimmer wiping out Bedford Falls in an oil tanker from the second Red Dwarf novel.
703 2018-07-11 22:49:36 getting my oil changed at Burnsworth Zollars makes me wanna buy another car. I want the green corvette, the red camaro, and the silver corvette. 
704 2018-07-11 22:49:26 And yet the US takes oil from Saudi Arabia. Remember, the people who took down the world trade center.

714 2018-07-11 22:48:07 I guess we Canadians could say that the US is beholden to Canada since we supply them with oil and hydroelectricity.

717 2018-07-11 22:47:44 He publicly accuses Germany of being in Putin's pocket because they buy Russian oil and gas, while he has years of murky-ass business dealings with Moscow that may eventually lead to criminal charges. Such an oaf.

723 2018-07-11 22:47:00 Maybe the oil price and soybean price drops will give her the boost she needs in a state where both are important. But I agree - she’s presently struggling.
724 2018-07-11 22:46:54 Next time, instead us all pretending we are a democracy and voting, just tell us whatever the rules are gonna be(what big pharma, oil, alcohol has payed you to say) as it is obvious what the people want and decide doesn't matter.

735 2018-07-11 22:45:11 NATO Europe: Russia is a huge threat to peace in europe

Also NATO Europe: Lets build an oil pipeline between Euope and Russia bc if there is a war Russia wont shut off the oil.
736 2018-07-11 22:45:08 Simple. Warm grill to medium high or so. Spread olive oil on the crab legs. Grill each side for 5-6 min. Prep your favorite dipping sauce. Basically they steam in their own juices inside the shell. Tip: use razor blade to cut smooth side of leg and remove the meat.
737 2018-07-11 22:45:05 So I gotta get an oil change and start getting ready to replace my tires.

762 2018-07-11 22:41:49 @realDonaldTrump @VP hey Trump. Your tariffs are only going to raise our cost in oil, gas, furniture, and food. You are not doing this to help us. You are doing it out of greed. Get over yourself. Your not doing any good for our country.

767 2018-07-11 22:41:20 @realDonaldTrump, your are sore, because Germany don't buy much oil from the USA. This is our decision. Your behavior is not a good advertisement. And we are using other sources for getting Energy!
768 2018-07-11 22:41:18 So Germany is buying Russian oil? Does she not know the spigot can be turned off with a flip of the switch?
769 2018-07-11 22:41:16 those contestants calling jun pretty boy as an insult while they're sitting there looking like they just took a bath in cooking oil, this is so sad alexa play my I by seventeens jun and minghao :((
770 2018-07-11 22:41:12 Except for OPEC screwing with oil prices and the fact that the president is now asking if he can invade
771 2018-07-11 22:41:00 They did refund me the time I found their oil dissolving the plastic stoppers they put inside the bottles. Fortunately I had only ingested a little but of dissolved plastics before i found this out.
772 2018-07-11 22:40:58 What happens when everyone can buy oil in whatever currency they want: Euros, Yuan, Gold?
Why would anyone hold U.S. dollars if they did not have to have them to buy energy? Why would they trade perfectly good labor for a piece of paper with green ink that loses 3% a year in BP?
773 2018-07-11 22:40:37 I lean for the oil markets..to day traders its HUGE
774 2018-07-11 22:40:34 I use Lancôme abs when I get home in the evening, e still Dey. No oil. My fenty on the other hand oxidizes so much that I end up looking orange at the end of the day.
775 2018-07-11 22:40:28 I want to know why Germany will not buy oil from Norway? Norway has oodles of oil in the North Sea. Perhaps because Russia is selling natural gas???

784 2018-07-11 22:39:45 And we also bought oil from Russia, check the govt website. NATO is nothing to do with trade, we buy chrome diopside and other minerals from Russia but Trump doesn't mention that!

787 2018-07-11 22:39:16 It's one of the least boring things he's said the entire time! Some girls like the smell of petrol and oil!
788 2018-07-11 22:39:11 Russia is Germany’s largest supplier for both oil and gas. Whilst Trump May have conflated energy with imported fuels his message still stands. And stop burning Lignite coal!
789 2018-07-11 22:39:01 Oil prices fell by record amounts this week the biggest fall for two years.
Our energy bills will not fall by record amounts
790 2018-07-11 22:38:56 yes for OIL is only 20%

IM TALKING ABOUT NATURAL GAS! WHICH IS 70!
791 2018-07-11 22:38:43 It's Florida! No need to ask
792 2018-07-11 22:38:43 Mine too!  I didn't discover how much I liked it until a few years ago.  My fav way to cook it is covered in olive oil and then on the grill.  Remind me tomorrow to buy some lol
793 2018-07-11 22:38:42 Germany is buying oil from Putin, but you’re still on the TrumPutin Train. I have a box of rocks that is better informed than you sir.
794 2018-07-11 22:38:40 Hey, maybe you could grow some plants in your garden... bury them... wait a million years... and then you'd have a blue state with some oil too!
795 2018-07-11 22:38:37 And I made the coconut milk by hand. I remember tasting the chicken like 20 times as I was seasoning it . And when frying it I took it out the oil about every 2 minutes to see if inside was cooked  but I didn’t wanna burn the outside
796 2018-07-11 22:38:28 Who doesn’t do this?
797 2018-07-11 22:38:26 These niggas make weed look bad and that was 8 grams in God's Holy oil, He told Moses to make.
798 2018-07-11 22:38:26 Hey why has gas prices soured up . Oil isn't that high to jump the price like this .
799 2018-07-11 22:38:22 Mr. Pickens, you can't be ignorant of the fact that the reason we buy all that energy from Saudi Arabia has nothing to do with energy, but with getting them to make OPEC force the world to do oil business in the U.S. Dollar. You have to attack the real problem if you want change.

805 2018-07-11 22:37:41 @potus is correct. We are protecting Germany with American dollars and Germany makes a deal worth billions with Russia for oil, coal. Why not buy American coal and oil? Germany has soaked us for 60 years and they are planning on doing it as long as they can.
806 2018-07-11 22:37:37 I'm communicating with you. AmI controlling you? Because, if I am, my car needs an oil change. Get to it, will you?
807 2018-07-11 22:37:35 OK, we try the Connection to Iran. Good gas, good oil.... Anything wrong?, Yes U. From a German, living in NY. We both live in the United States, a Part of AMERICA!!! We are not the world (and with Donald never will be...) So No more lies

811 2018-07-11 22:37:19 Great now get those steal tariffs off us so we can build new natural gas export facilities, do oil and gas expansions and start cashing in on the future of the energy market with american jobs and global influence. Please get in Trumps ear about this, love an impacted Texan.
812 2018-07-11 22:37:17 These data are collected by Albertans for Albertans. Neither the data nor I deny anyone’s individual struggles: aggregate data always contain a diversity of experience within them. But the data show that conditions in AB are broadly improving, helped by oil prices.
813 2018-07-11 22:37:12 This idiot sits there and attacks European countries for getting oil and gas from Russia when they have no one else to get it from. He has never mentioned that the US is paying Saudi Arabia for oil that we get from here in and around our own country. 2 of 3
814 2018-07-11 22:37:05 The word is buying  . Also wondering where does USA buy  its oil? Are we producing all we need? Any coming from "The Great White North"? 
815 2018-07-11 22:36:59 Give me ten page report on how Trump is selling out our country. Today was fun watching Trump shove it right up Putin's ass. The only thing Russia has is oil and natural gas. So today The Donald told other nations not to buy these commodities from Russia.
816 2018-07-11 22:36:50 I just bought CBD oil for the first time. Let’s hope this works friends

822 2018-07-11 22:35:16 Because like me there is no reason in writing to our MPs on Brexit. We voted Leave in a referendum but that wasn’t the end of it.

826 2018-07-11 22:35:03 telling my coworker how i want to buy an essential oil diffuser and she pulls one out from under her desk and gives it to me ............
827 2018-07-11 22:35:02 There are reports that President Donald Trump will “hammer Russia” on raising oil production. @PRICEfutures #OOTT

... Best of luck !
828 2018-07-11 22:35:01 うん。大丈夫。

あ、おはよう(ﾉ)*´꒳`*(ヾ)
829 2018-07-11 22:35:01 WOW! After YOU LIED about how much oil/Energy Germany gets from Russia AT NATO today--I'd think you'd be paying some attention to YOUR JOB&your own Damned Failure's! I don't see YOU sitting down w/ Mueller like Clinton did on Senate floor in Public Answering question for 9 hrs!
830 2018-07-11 22:34:50 Keep the mosquitos away with a few drops of Eucalyptus Oil on your ankles &amp; wrists.
831 2018-07-11 22:34:44 Ok bait & switch.

I do agree with you on this though. I think it is misguided. 

Although, the US buys oil from the Saudis (9/11 anyone) & Venezuela.... 

So glass houses, whatnot.
832 2018-07-11 22:34:23 see I get that we can reduce how much waste we produce as individuals, but how about we reduce how much industrial waste is produced?? the bendy straws I use aren't gonna matter when an oil rig shits in the ocean
833 2018-07-11 22:34:09 Vitamin E oil on the spots may be useful!
And try using green concealer to counteract the redness
834 2018-07-11 22:34:00 get some oil lmfaooo
835 2018-07-11 22:33:53 There is just never a good time to throw out one’s back.  Like here back pain I can pencil you in between all of my other crazy life.  

Couch, ice and Deep Relief roll on oil from YoungLiving.  

#aintnobodygottimeforthat — feeling pained
836 2018-07-11 22:33:48 What if Russia cut their oil off?        I think that’s the point the President was making.     There’s no doubt the deal between Germany & Russia was ill advised
837 2018-07-11 22:33:42 Before today Croatia was just q place on earth doing its thing, whatever that is, Now everyone knows who you are, I hope and pray yall already have democracy and you dont have oil otherwise expect a knock at the door by some chaps in uniform

839 2018-07-11 22:33:24 God forbid women should have to actually exercise personal responsibility and not be treated like moronic children who need big Daddy government to take care of them.  If that's a cookie box, I'll jump in myself.
840 2018-07-11 22:33:22 Beware of "experts" and snake oil salesmen.
841 2018-07-11 22:33:18 Primer, lots of setting powder, and a good quality setting spray. Then I keep oil blotting sheets on me to try to keep it under control. It's a daily struggle 
842 2018-07-11 22:33:15 F*** all three of you sorry asses Clinton your dick Bush you're about a non dick and Obama you're about a lying piece of s*** all y'all need to be in jail and Bush you couldn't hit a damn piece of oil or somebody showed you where the drill I know that I work with your companies
843 2018-07-11 22:33:02 CeraVe saved the oil spill on my face
844 2018-07-11 22:32:58 it’s about 40 percent for crude oil, and about 30 percent for coal. Not 9% like you sheep believe in Zacs tweet, but go on!
845 2018-07-11 22:32:53 There have been several in-depth news docs (Vice & others) on how Soybean oil trade is a huge destroyer of the economy, on level with deforestation. #TYTLive
846 2018-07-11 22:32:40 Just because they buy their oil from Russia doesn’t mean that NATO doesn’t unite Europe. We buy our oil from OPEC which is made up of Middle Eastern nations, yet we could still go to war with them. Fix your mistakes before taking on more ya dummy
847 2018-07-11 22:32:39 The projected oil/gas line is more important to Russia than to those at the receiving end. Oil/gas is Russias prime source of revenue; the NATO countries, particularly Norway and GB, produces more than enough of hydro/aeroelectric energy to supply Germany.
848 2018-07-11 22:32:33 Surratti oil perfumes
849 2018-07-11 22:32:31 Question for you. Last week, why did Trump ask Russia and Saudi Arabia produce more oil? Especially if he doesn’t want countries to use Russian oil.
850 2018-07-11 22:32:31 Vegan cosmetic is fine for me 
Even HAKAN's oil is nice to cleanser!

851 2018-07-11 22:32:28 Not Rely , that’s #fakenews and a false narrative. What do you think they Will do, attack there business partners and oil and gas customers in the west. The crimea thing is still a Russian sovjet empire legacy conflict. It belinged to the Russian empire for h7ndreds of years.
852 2018-07-11 22:32:23 *oil de-slick
853 2018-07-11 22:32:16 Why some think (& he claims!) trump is a good businessman & great dealmaker is beyond logic! He is a cheater & conman & sells snake oil at every turn. So covered in his own BS that it’s hard to see how the stench is tolerable even to his cult & sycophants.
854 2018-07-11 22:32:14 WRONG: it’s about 40 percent for crude oil, and about 30 percent for coal. That does not seem like 9% to me....
855 2018-07-11 22:31:55 Subscriber too. Change your editorial focus to a view i expect @arstechnica to be better at.  I'm no Elon lover but you seem to be drifting in an oil direction.
856 2018-07-11 22:31:47 The plant of many medical uses also, it's a damn plant, it isn't illegal to grow belladonna, or pennyroyal (a small amount of pennyroyal oil can kill an adult human) and yet here is MJ illegal as shit
857 2018-07-11 22:31:47 US? Oil and gas companies??  You mean multinational corporations so we provide protection for if they fill our campaign coffers.
858 2018-07-11 22:31:45 So, in the current arrangement, does Mexican crude oil go to US Gulf Coat refineries and then come back to Mexico as gasoline ?

863 2018-07-11 22:30:54 Horseshit..he just started awkward facts of 1 of our allies oil embarrassed dealings with Russia..and a rip- off of our trust and support..maybe a German Loyalty issue too.. But Great Swamp Bait..brings them up like electricity does to worms
864 2018-07-11 22:30:38 I met one in the wild today. I was having my oil changed. The TV was talking about the new attacks about Obamacare. He said he was glad he was covered by the ACA. It went downhill from there.
865 2018-07-11 22:30:36 So Trump calls Germany/Russia out 4 making a deal to buy Russia's oil going behind NATO's back and he's a puppet of Russia? Still NO proof of collusion b/c the only collusion was HRC/DNC/Fusion GPS and FBI/DOJ/Obama covering for all of them.

874 2018-07-11 22:29:38 Why don't the Israelis and/or Egyptians develop their gas and oil deposits to supply Europe?
875 2018-07-11 22:29:37 Plastic anything!!! Also PALM OIL!!!!
876 2018-07-11 22:29:35 The trouble with ScotsIndy is its 40 years too late. Most of the easy oil is gone, the rest has a high EROEI. 
The trouble with the EU is the 40 years ago it seemed a wonderful idea. Sweden and post-60s West Germany used to be nice places. Then something changed.
877 2018-07-11 22:29:17 Only use conditioner and coconut oil on the tips of your hair.
878 2018-07-11 22:28:51 Nobody undermining!!! He is asking to pay their share. By paying for gas and oil to Russia , Germany  makes Russia stronger, gov put billions in they own pockets and US has to spend money to protect them while EU is building socialism there. Why you  twist the facts?
879 2018-07-11 22:28:51 He was talking about Germany being controlled by Russia because of their dependence on Russia for oil and gas. Seemed that he was looking in the mirror and talking about himself… Not because of oil and gas but because of his own alliance with Russia/Putin. His usual MO

883 2018-07-11 22:28:30 En tres años, o menos, el peronismo estaba boqueando, y el General le ofrecio la Patagonia en concesión a la California Oil Co.

884 2018-07-11 22:28:14 Don’t forget Rob you are not a journalist. You are a blogger who is employed by big oil.
885 2018-07-11 22:27:50 listen you twit,germany paying Russia for oil and being a member of nato has nothing to do one another. tell your base and the rest of America what putin has on you. you look like your running scared
886 2018-07-11 22:27:38 i’m really bad at staying on top of my oil changes 
887 2018-07-11 22:27:35 Exactly, elon musk vs most big ceo's who aren't doing anything helpful.. honestly I think he getting more shit from trying to help then any of the really bad big ceos out there, what about oil companies? pharmacy companies? big banks? just saying
888 2018-07-11 22:27:35 Hey @finebaum it seems Joe from Atlanta's Mom wasn't a very good cook.  Dirty oil is gross. 
889 2018-07-11 22:27:30 ... 6) The pipeline was started by private business not gov't related
7) Merkel lead the EU in sanctions against Russia after Crimea.  
8) Merkel is the leading skeptic about Russian influence
9) 35% of oil comes from Russia. Trump wants it to come from the USA...
890 2018-07-11 22:27:23 The Oil has taken over. Flow with Him if you want HIS results.
891 2018-07-11 22:27:17 Ugh I know I go through them so fast! And yeah I really wanted to try it but I’m allergic to jojoba oil . The skin tint is ok but it’s practically just water.
892 2018-07-11 22:27:15 She’s also an expert on oil and gas...you know that thing that helps pay Quebec’s giant equalization payments because it’s a have-not province.  Moron.
893 2018-07-11 22:27:11 Is she on CBD oil? My Arlo has a neurological problem too, he is on it and I can honestly say he has been much better since we started xx
894 2018-07-11 22:27:09 Zion Oil & Gas -17% as SEC sends subpoena, opens investigation
895 2018-07-11 22:27:08 I know how to change the oil and change a tire but I can’t drive manual, and the guys at the tire shop are laughing at me. 
896 2018-07-11 22:27:07 I love their za’atar seasoning. It’s so good in hummus, or just on flatbread with oil
897 2018-07-11 22:27:06 They need natural gas/oil. We sell natural gas/oil. Shouldn’t Germany buy from the US instead of putting millions of dollars in Russia’s coffers? Valid point
898 2018-07-11 22:26:56 Again,you are misinformed @tacgm,Alberta does NOT own the oil,or any other minerals,they are federally held or owned by private companies (unfortunately,mainly American)...so that blows that idea up.Their best bet would be jump into bed with Montana and use American money .
899 2018-07-11 22:26:54 After taking back oil field in Syria, they try to recover Oil field in Iraq.
900 2018-07-11 22:26:53 Funded by NDP to kill our energy industry! And Soros ! Way to go .Are you going to Saudi Arabia to stop the oil from coming to Canada? Or is that too dangerous?
901 2018-07-11 22:26:44 @TorquayNHT dear Torquay police I live opposite the station and you need to oil or grease your entrance gate as it squeaks and we hear it every time the closes please stop it
902 2018-07-11 22:26:44 Right? Like I just want my oil done, don’t upsell me

906 2018-07-11 22:26:19 Fair enough. I got the “grow” oil cause mine has some small gaps to fill in.
907 2018-07-11 22:26:18 Gosh wala mi cooking oil haha
908 2018-07-11 22:26:13 I use an effaclar cleanser, rose water as a toner then grapeseed oil as a moisturizer every night
A honey, lemon, olive oil & sugar scrub once or twice a week
An egg white mask once a week
This is mainly for oily skin fa idk if it would be helpful 
909 2018-07-11 22:26:12 Virtually all of the replies support ICE.
910 2018-07-11 22:26:06 I’m guessing that the first batch doesn’t turn out well because the oil hasn’t reached temperature yet.
911 2018-07-11 22:26:03 @realDonaldTrump NATO is not about trade, it is about mutual protection.  Germany does not get all of its gas and oil from Russia they only get 34%, you obviously do not know what you are talking about.  You make me ashamed to call myself an American.  Fool.
912 2018-07-11 22:25:56 Usimg Trumpian logic, I guess it is a good thing the US doesn't buy oil or gas from, say, Canada or Saudi Arabia or Trump would look pretty stupid.
913 2018-07-11 22:25:47 No Canada is.  They would rather import oil from Saudi Arabia and Venezuela than buy from their own country.  Go figure that one out.
914 2018-07-11 22:25:39 OPEC President Suhail Al-Mazrouei Says Opec Doesn't Like To See Lots Of Fluctuation In Oil Prices.#OOTT
915 2018-07-11 22:25:36 We must stop with the dirty oil have we not done enough damage.
916 2018-07-11 22:25:24 Some say that the previous leader of Germany got rich because of Russian oil to Germany.

918 2018-07-11 22:25:00 Why do you think he was wearing black?
The oil is all over the place...That was a clear dress code statement 

919 2018-07-11 22:24:55 In 2019, the US is expected to average 12m barrels of crude oil production per day – making the world’s top oil producer.
 
(Energy Information Admin)
920 2018-07-11 22:24:43 You realize how stupid that sounds?  He’s insisting they stop buying Russia’s oil and gas.... quite the Russian puppet.
921 2018-07-11 22:24:43 There Is A Yoruba Saying That Says

922 2018-07-11 22:24:37 Woohoo! Thank you so much for playing our  Hereafter L12 @fusedofficial Oil Tank Mix 
923 2018-07-11 22:24:34 Trump demanding NATO spend more money on defense is a direct threat to Russia interests. German and the European Union becoming dependent upon Russian gas and oil allows for great control by Putin as they can turn of the spigot. Yet Trump is somehow doing the bidding of Moscow
924 2018-07-11 22:24:29 كنت فاكرك بتكذب الخبر....اما بالنسبة للبلد فعليها العوض خلاص
925 2018-07-11 22:24:16 Preheat pan, season steak, add 2tbsp olive oil to pan, sear medium heat both sides 2-3 minutes each. Turn to low and let cook for 3 minutes

928 2018-07-11 22:24:05 Weigh out eight cups of olive oil then put back on heat.
929 2018-07-11 22:23:54 Lol so in 04 Honda decided to start tucking oil pans above the trans ? Copy
930 2018-07-11 22:23:49 Correct. And the US relies on Saudi oil, sending trillions of dollars to the Saudis for oil, even after 9/11 (which was largely committed by Saudis). Why does @realDonaldTrump seem so closer to Russia and the Saudis than #NATO allies?
931 2018-07-11 22:23:47 Funny how Israel is "surrounded by enemies" but has a peace treaty with Egypt and Jordan that has lasted for decades. If they gave Syria the #Golan back they would have peace with them too..but they want oil more than peace. #BDS #GenieEnergy.
932 2018-07-11 22:23:42 I'm on Episode 4 of Season 6. Not a big Kerri Russell fan. I'd like the show better if someone else played her character.
933 2018-07-11 22:23:40 Damn, I might become oil pen convert
934 2018-07-11 22:23:40 We buy things from China. We buy tons of oil from those Republicans love to call terrorists. We had a $1 billion trade deficit with Russia last year, so we a buying things from them. And these people are hitting us with high tariffs because we did it first.
935 2018-07-11 22:23:33 Or.....you could take a hint from Shelby Miller and drink bullet proof coffee- black coffee w coconut oil (or more refined MCT oil) and heavy cream. Skip the sugar. “Let food be your medicine and  medicine be your food.” Hippocrates
936 2018-07-11 22:23:31 If it's so simple, do something called policy to do it. Give it a try you hack. Prove you are qualified for the job. Or are you just a snake oil fraud! Show us some actual policy. Or is it that you don't know how you liar!
937 2018-07-11 22:23:20 Other countries have been dumping inferior and sometimes just plane bad olive oil into the country. They could label it as virgin, extra virgin or use other terms/labels that have no standards.
938 2018-07-11 22:23:13 Ol'tax free bible thumping h@ifer still selling snake oil I see!
939 2018-07-11 22:23:11 Ha, today Trump just stuck it right up Putin's ass. All Russia has is oil and natural gas, so Trump just told other nations not to buy this commodity from them. Good God the Russian economy would collapse.
940 2018-07-11 22:23:10 Scummy snake oil salesman, Don the Con, lies again. Most tainted and corrupt human EVER!
941 2018-07-11 22:23:03 Your oil policies are weird!
942 2018-07-11 22:22:59 Perhaps there is. Besides cost sharing, maybe it would have been better for Merkle to have bought gas and oil from the US..or maybe drop some of their trade tariffs.
943 2018-07-11 22:22:41 Oh @Pottedhistory @PottedApprentis 
Here's a great one for new product inspiration I suspect you would have to keep @minimus_latin out of the lamp oil though
944 2018-07-11 22:22:32 So let me get this straight John.  You disagree with trump and believe we should pay to protect Germany from Russia while Germany is paying Russia for their oil pipeline ?   All the while saying trump is colluding with Russia for profit...  things that make you go hmmmmmmmmmm
945 2018-07-11 22:22:10 中に元々お菓子が入ってて、みんなに配ってたんですが、なくなったらしく、このゴ○をもらいました！！
946 2018-07-11 22:22:08 That's ridiculous, how could you say something like that? Papa John's EXCLUSIVELY uses only modified vegetable oil cheesy food product. CHEESE! How ridiculous.
947 2018-07-11 22:22:04 Wrong. Great show. Hang on though — it does move slowly at times.
948 2018-07-11 22:22:02 We pay billions to Central American countries for oil, does that mean we are being controlled by Mexico and Venezuela?
949 2018-07-11 22:22:02 Please explain how Trump is a treasonous traitor?  Does it really make sense for us to fund Germany's defense from Russia when they have oil deals with Russia which can shut off Germany's oil anytime?
950 2018-07-11 22:21:52 I hope wholeheartedly this entire bunch declines sunscreen in favor of baby oil. Natural selection.
951 2018-07-11 22:21:48 Good work, Ryan. Russia can't afford to turn off anyone's oil. They need the revenue. But its nice to know we agree that Russia colluded.
952 2018-07-11 22:21:31 Traitor @realDonaldTrump blasts Germany for making Russia richer for buying Oil. But Likes it just Fine That RUSSIANS are Lining Trumps Pockets with Illegal "Laundry Money" Stolen From The People of Russia & Illegal Enterprises. #DisgustingDonald
953 2018-07-11 22:21:28 But U.S.A. bought oil from the people who blew up the Twin Towers. Saudi Arabia.
954 2018-07-11 22:21:27 Way better than season 5.
955 2018-07-11 22:21:21 Rest of Canada buys Saudi Oil.  That’s the issue.
956 2018-07-11 22:21:15 @Yankees Snake oil salesman Brian Cashman is on the prowl again. Wanting your All Star for his A ball junk. Mr. Cash man says the Yankees top 10 prospects are untouchable but every one after that is available. The P. T. Barnum of baseball
957 2018-07-11 22:21:04 Attention #MAGA morons:
No NATO country owes "dues" to the US.
No NATO country has missed the 2024 deadline to spend 2% of their GDP on defense.
The US spends billions on Saudi Arabian oil. Do they control us??
PS: All Trump's dangerous lies about NATO are music to Putin's ears!!
958 2018-07-11 22:20:58 Trump is trying to bully NATO into embracing Putin like he is. He used Germanys dealings with Russias oil as an attempt to get Germany to admit they want full acceptance of Russia. Just like Putin, Trump is not to be trusted.
959 2018-07-11 22:20:51 Sorry, the government shouldn't be steering personal lifestyle choices. If my yoga classes are tax-deductible, about my pottery classes? I hear oIl painting is therapeutic. So is having a dog!
960 2018-07-11 22:20:50 Some of the things in that meme, you have to be joking about... cronyism? Wall Street sell out? Who’s been doing Wall Street speeches 10 at a time? Obama? Trump? Oil sellout? He opened up ANWAR to drilling twice? Why did he do that?... Please! Open your eyes...they’re all crooks
961 2018-07-11 22:20:05 I think Texas relies on the oil industry there too which is why it’s cheap compared to Florida who don’t have a big oil industry like Texas
962 2018-07-11 22:19:57 I need some cheap but effective CBD Oil (UK) makers... anyone?
963 2018-07-11 22:19:51 its like a climate report with gas oil n coal ads

965 2018-07-11 22:19:34 These niggas in autozone no help I told these fools I need oil they acting clueless just like me
966 2018-07-11 22:19:28 Venezuela ranks number 1 in oil reserves. Yet they are starving due to their socialism. BTW Exactly the government DEMS want for America
967 2018-07-11 22:19:20 Cave rescue mission for few boys but what about the surface boys who are bombarded for oil. The fuck!
968 2018-07-11 22:19:10 I’m actually going to try CBD oil tonight for inflammation because I’ve been suffering chronic eczema for 2 1/2 years.
969 2018-07-11 22:19:06 @Kallemet86 

Finding your theories really fascinating and even if we don't produce as much oil as Norway, the option of the sovereign oil wealth fund still stands

It would just grow slower but still accumulate wealth instead of debt
Just like Brexit is going

971 2018-07-11 22:19:01 Lmao if Russia is good enough to buy uranium from the United States then why not give them Germany for a few barrels of oil?
972 2018-07-11 22:18:57 Your burner’s on too hot.
That’s more oil than you need.
Taste it before you salt it.
973 2018-07-11 22:18:56 #UN know exactly what is going on in that area, but choose to look away because of oil in the land of Lost Jews of Africa, mostly Igbo tribes and related. If you check the political history of #Ambazonia #Biafra lands, you'll feel as sick as i am.I'm ashamed to be part ignorantly
974 2018-07-11 22:18:45 Libya resumes oil export.

976 2018-07-11 22:18:22 You people expecting IMMEDIATE results from taking green tea and fish oil...

It takes years of accumulation before you see any results.  

But that doesn't mean stop taking 'em.
977 2018-07-11 22:18:09 #tytlive So, the implication being: Germany must be dependent on US oil instead of Russian oil, because America must maintain it's monopoly on world economic hegemony.
978 2018-07-11 22:17:58 Poloz: "#Export growth is expected to increase over the projection horizon, supported mainly by solid foreign demand growth and higher #oil prices" Oil: “Hold my beer”
979 2018-07-11 22:17:53 Doesn't the US get a large amount of oil from Alaska and if go to the coast you can see Russia.
980 2018-07-11 22:17:40 Apparently my son believes he can clean most of the bathroom floor this way.
981 2018-07-11 22:17:36 I could argue that but the counter is Alberta denies its oil and resources to the rest of Canada if the Federal govt won’t give them a 6 month window to get their own currency. Ultimately the point is that Alberta would have its own currency in a reasonable amount of time.
982 2018-07-11 22:17:33 So ready to be done with oil paint and onto the water based
983 2018-07-11 22:17:32 There it is.  We’re doomed.
984 2018-07-11 22:17:32 I’ve been putting Vitamin E oil on my face to clear it up . It’s working slowly but surely
985 2018-07-11 22:17:20 #tytlive Natural gas comprises only 20% of Germany's energy mix.  Even if 70% of it were Russian, that's only 14% of the energy total.  

By that logic, the US is a captive of Canada, since we provide 15% of the US' Oil needs.
986 2018-07-11 22:17:20 This is The reason why Germany buys oil from Russia rather than from NATO Nations
987 2018-07-11 22:17:05 I think peanut butter & olive oil may be a better option..
988 2018-07-11 22:17:02 Thanks for asking! There has been some progress for Jasper (Daisy’s brother). I’ll post more soon. 
Great tip about coconut oil!
989 2018-07-11 22:16:55 Riiiight. By cautioning Germany and NATO about using Russian oil, he’s doing Putin’s bidding. Actors are not known for their intellect.
990 2018-07-11 22:16:48 they try to take back oil field, send fighters jets to Baiji refinery.
991 2018-07-11 22:16:42 Burning Oil and Exhaust pipes.
992 2018-07-11 22:16:40 Why do I keep ending up with cars that need synthetic oil?! I’m sitting here like “oh I have an American car finally I can probably get a cheap $20 oil change” I T H O U G H T
993 2018-07-11 22:16:29 My understanding is that Trump primarily unset Angela Dorothea Merkel Chancellor of Germany for making deals for oil/gas from Russia, a supposed arch enemy of Germany, EU, the West in general, and America. What do you say Hardball?
994 2018-07-11 22:16:26 Well you’re a rare bread to be left and work as a trade. I can personally attest to the fact I’ve never met a Democrat in the oil field. Usually ppl that work with their hands are smart enough to know a union socialist mentality is counterproductive
995 2018-07-11 22:16:09 EZ shares -1.5%, US shares -0.7% as trade war fears resume.

You must REMAIN IN THE ANOINTING!
997 2018-07-11 22:16:02 what brand of motor oil do you use in your hair?
998 2018-07-11 22:15:54 The Saudi military cooperates with the US military. The attackers were Saudi, but not Saudi backed. Bin Laden's family themselves cooperated with us trying to find him and disowned him. They're still a bit backwards, but an ally.

And if we had it our way, we'd only us US oil

1000 2018-07-11 22:15:40 For those too young to remember the Arab oil embargo almost crippled the USA economy. Think about what Germany and other parts of Europe dependent on Russian energy now face should Russia decide to cut em off. Trump is exactly right again.
1001 2018-07-11 22:15:39 No he never said not to by their oil.

He is pissed they are because we are now producing much more natural gas which him and Pruitt have shares in and he wants into that German market! Trust Trumputin does nothing for nobody but Trumputin himself!
1002 2018-07-11 22:15:31 Subway for dinner tonight yay I got a turkey on honey oat bread with provolone cheese, cucumbers, pickles, lettuce, tomato, black olives and pickles with a little bit of olive oil and vinegar I never get the mayonnaise subway mayonnaise upsets my stomach
1003 2018-07-11 22:15:31 a midnight oil fan?
1004 2018-07-11 22:15:25 Love is what they are most hateful about as the anointing oil of caring has all run out. They cannot be budged from their hatefulness. That is exactly what Hillary never understood.
1005 2018-07-11 22:15:19 Trump is just mad that he's not getting a piece of the pie from the Russian oil exchange with Europeans #tytlive
1006 2018-07-11 22:15:17 That place was a clown show. Service was awful. Had to explain their job to them. They had one car and six employees when I got there. Made me back into the bay with the other car instead of the empty bay. While I think their 15 minute oil change promise is ridiculous, so was 1hr
1007 2018-07-11 22:15:16 @KaylarWill what’s the lightest body scent ya got in the highlighter oil? My body is ready.
1008 2018-07-11 22:15:16 Well, that's a little strong for me but you are entitled to your opinion. I  just want our residents to know that the commissioners will continue to request fair & equitable school funding & that some of the oil & gas severance tax  come back to Belmont County to pave roads.
1009 2018-07-11 22:15:15 Picked a GREAT day to do an oil change... not. 3 cars back in line plus the 4 in the garage. Ughhhhhhhh
1010 2018-07-11 22:15:13 I’d like to thank this tanning oil for my slight shade difference 
1011 2018-07-11 22:15:05 You're probably aware about the boycott in Morocco over spikes in some dairy, water and oil prices. So to avoid getting in the boycott train, kindly remedy to the greed of the franchisee in Marrakech that saves on salary by hiring less cashiers and cash-bands unfixed!
1012 2018-07-11 22:15:01 Headache since the start of the day and it has got sooo worse, I could bathe in axe oil.
1013 2018-07-11 22:14:50 Easy: roast with some olive oil, garlic, salt and pepper.
Slightly more complex: slice thin, make au gratin.
Slightly more complex: pork and turnip pie.
They also make good fries.
1014 2018-07-11 22:14:46 When WWE women endorse shit inducing products. They work out every day and stick to a strict nutritional regimen. A healthy diet and working out is what helps you loose weight. Anything else is a lie. I'm sick of people glamorizing snake oil.
1015 2018-07-11 22:14:45 All the oil shorts malfunctioned @CMEGroup @CMEActiveTrader Lool
1016 2018-07-11 22:14:31 And it was very generous of BP to clean up after the oil spill. 

You’re a miserable cruel “Public Servant” Mr. Secretary
1017 2018-07-11 22:14:22 #TYTLive wtf is Trump talking about?  Um, dumbass, you know put a man with an oil deal with Russia at the head of the State Department!
1018 2018-07-11 22:14:16 In the next 10 years it maybe doubled or tried.  So they still wouldn't be paying their part. I love Germany, but getting all their oil and gas from Russia makes them dependant on Russia so they can't be our friend without Russia cutting out their oil supply.
1019 2018-07-11 22:14:13 It might be the best experience you've ever had, BUT, I'mma tell you a less painful way: Oil up the butt
1020 2018-07-11 22:14:13 What are you thought about oil pipleline, LNG pipeline, our economy , housing price .  Canada is getting worst place to invest.
1021 2018-07-11 22:14:11 I already have balm I don't need oil the balm give it the shine and holds it in place better than the oil
1022 2018-07-11 22:13:51 Rapids - 6221 Robinson Rd. for an oil spill from a Mva
1023 2018-07-11 22:13:43 So true. We import oil from he country that sent the 911 hijackers.
1024 2018-07-11 22:13:39 I’d like to thank everyone who helped pushing down oil for letting me cut my losses at an okay level. this pain i can bear. 

Now back to football. I hear it’s not coming home after all.
1025 2018-07-11 22:13:38 Except for literally calling out Germany for partnering w/ Putin on the oil pipeline. .  U can't be this stupid - right?   Liberal fail again.  #fakenews #WalkAway

1033 2018-07-11 22:13:02 Oil check!
1034 2018-07-11 22:12:55 I mean REEEEEEEEEEEEE
1035 2018-07-11 22:12:54 Study your history Mr. Trump. For the entire Cold War, the USA traded with the old USSR. It was primarily commodities, including oil, and the USA paid $ billions into USSR's coffers.  And that was during a time when the USA and USSR were formal enemies. The Cold War is over now.
1036 2018-07-11 22:12:51 @xxxRiley sure would like to see you using that oil
1037 2018-07-11 22:12:34 My question is, how on earth did Germany get an oil pipeline built from Russia through the Baltic Sea without the greenies losing their ever-loving minds? #NATO
1038 2018-07-11 22:12:30 行くか、地獄に
1039 2018-07-11 22:12:29 It's tough when someone looks you in the eyes and tells you the truth. Germany is making a pact with the sworn ENEMY (Russia) and America is suppose to say okie dokie. 
When Russia turns off the gas/oil don't look to us to help.
1040 2018-07-11 22:12:25 #Trump "Germany is totally controlled by Russia"
WTF @realDonaldTrump, #WTF | the oil setup might not be ideal, but fuck, totally controlled? Your criticizing them, while so frequently praising Russia, and refusing to acknowledge their interference. You playing both sides here?
1041 2018-07-11 22:12:23 I bought coconut oil to fix it lmao
1042 2018-07-11 22:12:23 Hey Don! We still still import for oil & petroleum products from Saudi Arabia but guess where some of the 9/11 attackers were from? And they are considered one of our closest allies in the Middle East. #weird
1043 2018-07-11 22:12:14 .. mine have mackerel in sunflower oil .. 
1044 2018-07-11 22:12:10 @AriMelber yes Putin happy that Trumps trying to stop Germany from giving him all that oil money. 
1045 2018-07-11 22:12:00 NOOOOOOOOOO.
1046 2018-07-11 22:11:55 How much has the oil industry in Scotland given to the treasury?

1051 2018-07-11 22:11:24 Was that tuna in brine or sunflower oil..
1052 2018-07-11 22:11:00 Serious question? Is that coconut oil?
1053 2018-07-11 22:10:53 Hell!! If price of oil goes up the price on the forecourt follows within hours. We dont have to wait for the more expensive new fuel to work through the system and get delivered to the petrol station then!! I suppose we have to grant the oil companies a little gouging time!
1054 2018-07-11 22:10:35 Snake oil anybody? Seems canavan has bucket loads of the stuff. Guaranteed to cure baldness, progressive, community focussed values, honesty, integrity, compassion. Taken daily, you too will convert to a warrior for the obscenely wealthy, disingenuous, Jackals & parasites.

1058 2018-07-11 22:10:07 エクストラバージンオイルってなんか卑猥だよね。
1059 2018-07-11 22:10:04 and the bastards doing commentry in 'english' was so biased.

Leviticus 2:4 NKJV
1061 2018-07-11 22:09:57 Sanctions are a diplomatic tool. If NATO wishes to impose oil and gas sanctions against Russia to reach some result, they should do so. Did anyone ask Trump how he feels about sanctions against Russia? How's that going?
1062 2018-07-11 22:09:55 @cnnbrk Canada and Mexico supply the U.S. with about as much energy (oil, electric, natural gas...) as Germany gets from Russia.  Guess that means Canada and Mexico hold the U.S. 'captive.'
1063 2018-07-11 22:09:45 I made some Tzatziki earlier.  Greek yoghurt, garlic, cucumber, olive oil, mint, white wine vinegar.  Currently demolishing it to eat up all the ale I drank during the game!

1065 2018-07-11 22:09:40 MIXED with Oil and ANOINTED with Oil.
1066 2018-07-11 22:09:33 This is about the extent of it people, even when the votes are in, your still screwed! This seems to be consistant throughout the party in charge! This is the way it goes, when oil & gas want to keep control of the state! No room for a billion$ industry!
1067 2018-07-11 22:09:32 Well, yeah. A blended vegetable oil. Or butter, if the guest requests it. I put this dude’s order in and he didn’t ask for butter until his omelet arrived.
1068 2018-07-11 22:09:25 Why because he's right they should pay their share. Why aren't you mad that Merkel has a side deal with Putin's oil line? Seems like are allies are cozying up with Putin. Like your friend Hillary.
1069 2018-07-11 22:09:20 Lol I wish 100% to the downside for all these dirty ass oil companies. Clean and renewable energy is the future. 

But I do agree that $ZN is going to crumble LT. 

It’s also taking them awhile to produce the reports from this well that supposedly has oil.

#oil #short #stocks
1070 2018-07-11 22:09:20 Well how about this. The whole world is held captive by Saudi Arabia with their oil supplies. Again POTUS is speaking from his rear end just to create fear and bully our allies.
1071 2018-07-11 22:09:12 Finally got an oil change !!! It’s beeen waaaayyy over due like 10,000 miles over due 
1072 2018-07-11 22:09:07 To be clear, I am referring to: 

Obama/Hillary selling uranium to Russia. 

Obama, Hillary and our alleged “anti-Russian allies” in the EU signing the Iran deal. 

Merkel signing oil/gas pipeline deal with Russia
1073 2018-07-11 22:08:52 Anyone remember the British National Oil Corporation. Think BP bought it.
1074 2018-07-11 22:08:32 Wish you weren't owned by the oil industry
1075 2018-07-11 22:08:31 Quit buying snake oil from Curry!
1076 2018-07-11 22:08:30 Libs are so deranged they are actually claiming Trump is doing Putin’s bidding at NATO Summit while he calls out Germany and others for buying Russian oil and promoting they buy US oil and grains rather than Russian... 

Liberalism is mental illness
1077 2018-07-11 22:08:15 What’s the point of making appointment for oil change if its still gonna take 3 hours!!!!
1078 2018-07-11 22:08:12 kejdibaal is trying to finish his challenge in delhi....

1081 2018-07-11 22:07:46 The thing is already fried in oil of some kind, surely?
1082 2018-07-11 22:07:34 They've lied to us for years, now they are lying about their bent firm of democracy so we swallow whatever they want us to in the future. Castor oil anybody?
1083 2018-07-11 22:07:32 With minimal research & some basic analysis, it's clear why Trump is mad at Germany. Russia wants to build a pipeline to Germany, edging out US oil interests. Trump wants to sabotage Putin's planned pipeline. Voila. Context & analysis. Not hard, kids. #tytlive
1084 2018-07-11 22:07:24 You know it’s summer in Otisco when they’re oil and stoning the roads
1085 2018-07-11 22:07:24 I appreciate you sharing your thoughts. I understand the slippery ups and downs of oil predictions.
1086 2018-07-11 22:07:22 Make sure you get the beard oil with it. #allornothing
1087 2018-07-11 22:07:14 hahahaha
1088 2018-07-11 22:07:12 Kind of amazed it took about 2.5-3 hrs to replace both fuel sending units & oil change on my car. Hardest part was removing part of back seat & reassembling. Few pains here & there but would also like to think that $175 is better than cost of having legit mechanic do the work.
1089 2018-07-11 22:07:08 GERMANY will get their fas and oil cut in mid winter.
1090 2018-07-11 22:06:59 We are still not coming to the common consensus of the option of a sovereign oil welfare fund

Tack, think we are done here, because you clearly don't want to see it

Why do you think Norway is so rich, because they are smart and they care about their citizens
Just like Iceland
1091 2018-07-11 22:06:56 He was FILLED with Oil and Anointed with Oil, the Spirit resting upon Him
1092 2018-07-11 22:06:53 Ayudó caída del OIL y caída del Euro / Dólar, pareciera que finalmente este último inició ahora si su viaje a la zona del 13 / 11 que hace rato estamos esperando
1093 2018-07-11 22:06:47 Not really. I think he was criticizing the pipeline to lay context to argue for leaving NATO: “If you’re buying so much oil from Russia, then why do you need the US as part of an alliance to protect you from Russia?”
1094 2018-07-11 22:06:32 Pres. Trump: "Germany is a captive or Russia."
If Russia decides to let them go without oil,
they'll freeze to death.
1095 2018-07-11 22:06:19 That’s the silliest speech ever! You sound like a snake oil politician.

Rouse that rabble!
1096 2018-07-11 22:06:11 OIL makes everything work SMOOTHLY.
1097 2018-07-11 22:06:06 The worst part about the price of oil going up is having to hear Texans on the radio say “ol”.
1098 2018-07-11 22:06:04 Ireland actually are surviving quite well on our own and currently hold a veto to Brexit over the Irish border issue. Scotland have the oil fields to the north and Wales...well wales are about fucked yeah. Seems like England itself is the one that'd be fucked mate.
1099 2018-07-11 22:06:02 I use urban decay optical illusion. It’s crazy bc I don’t have huge pores or anything. I used to use oil drops too bc that helped but it doesn’t as much.
1100 2018-07-11 22:05:39 hahahaha

that is why it was the first duty of narender modi to shut down shops like rNDTV, burka dutt, khapeesh etc.  BUT HE HAS TOTALLY FAILED IN punishing the rascals.
1101 2018-07-11 22:05:32 @WCCOAmelia Media forgot to mention the president of the oil pipeline into Germany is a former East German secret police member who also worked with Putin in the KGB. Additionally a whole pack of German politicians are being paid huge salaries by the oil pipeline. @PatKessler
1102 2018-07-11 22:05:24   oil trade is bad for sanctions and leverage over . Just like Obama broken  line in the sand paved the way for  takeover of Crimea, and the Obama FECKLESS sanctions that followed? Why feckless? B/C Obama gave  $150B so they could buy weapons from  #Dumb
1103 2018-07-11 22:05:20  I’m sick of these celebrities giving they baby ridiculous names like are you kidding me... next thing you know we’re going to hear a baby named “Walmart” “K-Mart” “Oil” “Bleach” “Weather” “East” “Purple” “Stopsign” and don’t forget yo lil sis “MySpace”.....
1104 2018-07-11 22:05:20 B&M sell citronella oil. You can make a cheap lamp and keep the mozzies off too.
1105 2018-07-11 22:05:11 “The bottle is artisanal glass made from recycled Edison bulbs. The rag is organic fair-trade cotton, ethically harvested at a small family farm. The fuel is 100% craft biodiesel, made from leftover vegan frying oil used exclusively at a speakeasy grill in Berkeley”
1106 2018-07-11 22:05:00 Auba, Ozil, laca,Ramsey, mkhi, sead, and few more good players, we don’t have the Arab oil money like you, but god it must feel awful to spend all that money and not amount to anything, you’re just like us but with money  the FA cup is twice the trophy the Ligue 1 is lmao 
1107 2018-07-11 22:04:57 @TheGlowPot when can we expect for the marula oil to be back in stock? Been eyeing it for ages 
1108 2018-07-11 22:04:56 The 45-70 is a worthy round, no doubt! 

But still..
1109 2018-07-11 22:04:40 Loving my personal essential oil diffuser from @myMONQ!
1110 2018-07-11 22:04:38 No. You're just a member of NATO, you don't run it. #NATO agreed with Obama (not you) to raise to 2% within the decade, and they are doing so. BTW, Europe came to US's aid after the Saudi 9/11 hit. Who are you to query German-Russian energy trade when the US depends on Saudi oil?
1111 2018-07-11 22:04:22 No offense Ma'am, but you got sold.  As did Midwest farmers where soybeans are down 20% while crude oil is up 7% -- trade war. I'm sure they will remain in denial thru this year's elections, but come 2020 it will have sunk in how badly they got got bent and trumped.
1112 2018-07-11 22:04:19 @oil_rag mannequin pussy follows you? wth teach me your ways
1113 2018-07-11 22:04:09 I’ve done two oil changes for $150 each. Tire rotations have been free. All other service has been covered under manufacturer warranty.
1114 2018-07-11 22:04:07 @GermanyNATO um @DFB_Team_EN  yo @GermanyDiplo   yo no more oil gas energy from @Russia  no more   @MedvedevRussiaE  No more  @israel_mid_ru  assad shouldnt stay in power he should be arrested @KremlinRussia_E  Trump cant be your Puppet He supposed to be Leader.
1115 2018-07-11 22:04:05 Then drill a side track off HH1 and test it. Could be looking at up to 5 to 8000 barrels of oil a day from that some reports say.
1116 2018-07-11 22:04:00 That just explains the ever coming dynamics but not the sovereign oil wealth fund which none of these countries opted for just like England
1117 2018-07-11 22:03:50 Good luck but wished u came back to the oil
1118 2018-07-11 22:03:50 Kai @oil_shaeikh ban da addu'ar Maguxawa....  A yi MA su addu'ar shiriya.. 
1119 2018-07-11 22:03:49 Trumps right about Germany.
Its just like the US being captive to the Saudis because of oil.
1120 2018-07-11 22:03:40 It is delicious, my mom and I usually fix it with olive oil and garlic salt
1121 2018-07-11 22:03:35 とりあえずスクショ撮りながらシンデレラロード進めて支払いしに行くムーブで今日は行きましょ
1122 2018-07-11 22:03:34 Just need half a bottle of baby oil then we will be able to see you from space
1123 2018-07-11 22:03:24 Okay first of all im keeping that as my cover photo and i will tell you why, Scotland import oil which brings in alot of money but all that money goes to yous to fund your queens fucking palace n shit for England not Scotland and thats why, yous lot steal our money and use us.
1124 2018-07-11 22:03:19 Trump: Germany get gas from Russia! Inappropriate!

Oh god, nobody tell him about the US destabilising the Middle East for oil!
1125 2018-07-11 22:03:17 They get their oil from Russia & the thing in the WH gets favors from Russia & Ivanka gets her handbags from China
1126 2018-07-11 22:03:14 If you want supernatural results, permanent, eternal results, WAIT for the OIL, wait for the Spirit.
1127 2018-07-11 22:03:03 No, what I think is naive is idea that EU countries can get their act together & actually resist Russian aggression into areas they want, especially when Russian can just turn off the oil/gas of Germany.
Europe won't get its act together even though Trump is telling them truth.
1128 2018-07-11 22:03:01 How is it that oil inventory drops 12.6M barrels and price drops $4/barrel?
1129 2018-07-11 22:02:55 Now now salmond based our economy on oil being at $130 per barrel, in 2014 it peaked at $112 before dropping to below $90 at which point UK oil wasn't making money for the treasury.
1130 2018-07-11 22:02:54 Trade and military protection are separate.  Where does our crude oil come from?  Who are we captives of?
1131 2018-07-11 22:02:53 Wch crude oil .... Abi is typing error check well ... My state is Lagos state cum argue make we do state contributions to d nation fuck fayose #thug
1132 2018-07-11 22:02:46 Oil paintings are expensive....
1133 2018-07-11 22:02:28 SO EVERYBODY THATS GON WANT AN OIL INBOX ME UR NUMBERS 30$ drop offs 35$
1134 2018-07-11 22:02:26 Just like were captive to the Saudis because of oil.
1135 2018-07-11 22:02:24 Don’t get me started on coconut. Or olives, aka “death on pizza”. (But I do enjoy olive oil.)
1136 2018-07-11 22:02:18 Please post some images
1137 2018-07-11 22:02:06 You’re right on the 2% gdp Mr President Trump but I don’t catch the link with the Russian gas ? They are also buying pétrin from Algeria where USA have interests in many oil fields :-)
1138 2018-07-11 22:02:06 US also pays billions to Russia for oil and gas.
1139 2018-07-11 22:02:02 @RaheemSZN hahaha where was you before the sheikh oil money ?  Oh yeah  nowhere
1140 2018-07-11 22:01:59 おはようございます(*^^*)
1141 2018-07-11 22:01:43 You could have opted for it 

And mr 2013

You put a certain percentage into the sovereign oil wealth fund and watch it grow and prosper

But you don't want to understand the dynamics
1142 2018-07-11 22:01:42 and what did law-of-the-land did?

stop crying, it is YOUR govt take action. You lul.
1143 2018-07-11 22:01:42 Lol banida irin mamansu yellow da khaleel
1144 2018-07-11 22:01:36 I hate being at such an f’ing disadvantage when I get my tires rotated or an oil change. Do you believe them and buy what they say you need or risk your family’s life. So angry.
1145 2018-07-11 22:01:36 When I was in Iraq in 2007 for the British military, I realised we were just there for oil. The average solider is a poor working class man. You are manipulated into thinking you are a hero. Really you are just a terrorist...
1146 2018-07-11 22:01:28 What will Canada do if Russia bullies Canada over oil in the Arctic? They don't have the capability to defend themselves from Russia.. I hope weak Justin Trudeau doesn't ask America taxpayers for help :)

1150 2018-07-11 22:01:13 Getting an oil change today, about a quart low when they checked it...just fixed a huge oil leak in Jan $1000 so wtf??
1151 2018-07-11 22:01:05 @BernieSanders @SenWarren @Ocasio2018 etc so called "socialists" actually owe their success 2 CAPITALISM, Bernie owns 3 homes, Warren is worth 10M & Cortez the daughter of a successful architect went to Boston University  They live the American capitalist dream, only in the USA
1152 2018-07-11 22:01:02 Do it then.  Poland has already offered to pay for bases
1153 2018-07-11 22:01:00 Black gold: EIA forecasts that the United States will average nearly 12M barrels of crude oil production per day.
1154 2018-07-11 22:00:57 We like Mitsukan's とろっ豆 at our office!

Natto usually comes with sauce and mustard, but If you're a beginner (or not), I would recommend you to add some other stuff such as kimchi, sesame oil, shiso, plum vinegar, chopped greenonion! ♡KANAE
1155 2018-07-11 22:00:57 If you do use Dr. Bronners soap in your hair you’ll need to mix (in a separate bottle) water & coconut oil. If you use it on its own it can be slightly stripping for your curly tresses.
1156 2018-07-11 22:00:52 Didn't they say they do a short test first? #UKOG will test the Portland . Declaration it's commercial. The same with kimmeridge Kl3 & KL4. In 2016 each layer bopd was RNSd individually. Plenty of news to look forward if you're a believer.. Sell the oil asap = Cash.
1157 2018-07-11 22:00:46 The United States is the largest oil producer in the world.

The United States pays the highest share of NATO cost.

The United States is a closer ally to the UK, France, Germany, and others than they are to Russia.

SO WHY ARE THEY BUYING ALL THEIR OIL FROM RUSSIA? #NATO
1158 2018-07-11 22:00:42 Fuck it time to bring out the castor oil 
1159 2018-07-11 22:00:39 Ofcos the money attracts Glory to the club of which further enhances the club's prestige.
You think all of the players City signed last season came because of the Club? It's the f***ing Oil 
1160 2018-07-11 22:00:32 And Trump attacks Germany for buying oil from Russia while the USA buys oil from a country that HE WANTED TO INVADE

1164 2018-07-11 22:00:24 Maybe the proper summer is messing with our body clocks. I just started on CBD oil n am finally getting 7hrs 
1165 2018-07-11 22:00:16 VOLTRONIC 5W40 OEM ultra light running fully synthetic all round motor oil made in Germany.
1166 2018-07-11 22:00:16 That is a strange story from CNN! Putin is making a lot of money from Germany who is buying their oil/gas. Might stop with Trump pressure. Another Dem needs to stop talking and THINK!
1167 2018-07-11 22:00:08 you are right from what I have read, and the repubs USED to be good guys, such a shame they are now the party of racists, sexists, violent criminals and snake oil salesmen
1168 2018-07-11 22:00:01 Oops fat fingers and small phone equals wrong word at the beginning. Meant to say it will take you, not sure where oils came from. Oh yeah, I need an oil change in my truck. I guess it was a subliminal reminder.
1169 2018-07-11 21:59:55 Mi padre lloraba al ver cómo dilapidaban las riquezas en el Chaco, tierra dejó la vida un hermano suyo, y él luchó por dos años y diez meses hasta tres meses después de finalizada la guerra. Ellos, todos, lucharon por el Paraguay, su Patria, no por la Shell ni la Standard Oil.
1170 2018-07-11 21:59:54 Glaube versetzt Berge. 
Auch welche die gar nicht da sind. 
Und was genau ist der Unterschied zwischen Homöopathie und Snake Oil?
1171 2018-07-11 21:59:53 Okay but WHY do I have to type in my email address again if I press the un-subscribe button on an email SENT TO THAT ADDRESS. I’m almost 99% certain that it just signs me up for 10 more emails a day. also, who signed me up for cannibis oil emails. Fess up.
1172 2018-07-11 21:59:50 My life almost ended. I lost my ring but then I remembered I took it off to put oil in my hair AHHHHA I FEEL SICK
1173 2018-07-11 21:59:47 White baby? Nazi baby? Brown baby? Where to put my empathy? Zinke property or not? Oil rights? Minimum wage dad or 1% dad who doesn’t believe in abortion or child support? Married or his girlfriend on the side because he’s born again in a white state that thinks it’s religious?
1174 2018-07-11 21:59:46 I call extra virgin olive oil E.V.O.O in a heavy accent sometimes and it’s all Rachael rays fault
1175 2018-07-11 21:59:45 I'm in the new room, I'm shattered, am cream crackered, I'm oil tankered, am shelf stackered
1176 2018-07-11 21:59:43 Or simply currency swaps. What China and Russia are doing these days. China pays for Russian oil and natural gas in RMB, the Russians buy Chinese goods in Rubles. Win-win. Lol

1179 2018-07-11 21:59:28 If we can subsidize Texas oil company Kinder Morgan with Billion$  and let them charge us rent , I am sure we can afford to pay a few bus drivers to keep the routes going. #CanadaFirst
1180 2018-07-11 21:59:15 You haven't experienced the thrills of life unless you've been burned by shimmering oil when flipping a platano.
1181 2018-07-11 21:59:12 Considering 8.1% of US oil is imported from Saudi Arabia & 19/20 09/11 hijackers came from there, should this T-RUmp really have any room to talk?
Of course, Saudis help T-RUmp out during & after election so T-RUmp likely has the same special rules for them that he has for Putin.
1182 2018-07-11 21:59:11 An attack?
We pay billions to defend you from your supposed enemy Russia, an enemy you get your oil from! Not to mention an ex German Chancelor is on the Russian gas company board!
As for Mr. Trump.
Justin, is next!
Tomorrow!
Trump brought a NATO whooping stick, he calls it JT!
1183 2018-07-11 21:58:49 Thinly sliced cabbage, oil, vinegar, salt, right? This is what I have every time in Trogir/Ciovo. Delicious!
1184 2018-07-11 21:58:44 Dang that sucks.  
What primer did you use? 
I used the glitter primer and on top of it I added the benefit porefessional primer. But then again I’m no wear near oily lol. If anything I add oil drops to my face for moisture 
1185 2018-07-11 21:58:37 I wonder if another car or oil company is behind this. Fear makes people do desperate things 
1186 2018-07-11 21:58:28 Oil is the Spirit. Not by might, Not by power, send YOUR SPIRIT God.
1187 2018-07-11 21:58:04 People knew and they choose to ignore it because oil prices were high and the money was flowing. People were living in the moment and high on the hog will the all the projects. NLer's seen high paying MF jobs and didn't care about the repercussions.
1188 2018-07-11 21:58:02 This is at best incredibly unethical and it’s gonna get someone killed. I’m so frustrated. 

We had an issue w our local diner switching to cooking in peanut oil and not telling anyone, nearly hospitalized me, and this is a *chain* that’s everywhere!
1189 2018-07-11 21:57:53 What is hemp made out of einstein? .  while there might be a microscopic market for hemp milk and hemp oil at hippy fairs, the vast majority of cannibus plants (dare i say - 97%) are grown to get people high
1190 2018-07-11 21:57:53 Why am I late? Because I had to bio oil every inch of my body
1191 2018-07-11 21:57:47 "Tell the Senate?" PLEASE. If only that would work. The @GOP in charge WANT a greedy, science denying, oil/coal/gas/chem purchased lobbyist in charge of @EPA!!! Brings in more campaign $$.
1192 2018-07-11 21:57:43 Oil makes everything run smoothly. Oil makes everything work RESTFULLY. Oil makes everything move in the rhythm of GRACE.
1193 2018-07-11 21:57:38  had to pay for a new battery and oil change, Sasha had to go get shots, she’s getting boarded for 8 days at $15 a night, and I still have a vacation to go on 
1194 2018-07-11 21:57:29 trying so hard not to give into taking antibiotics. using black seed oil right now instead but ugh something keeps telling me to just take them & idk
1195 2018-07-11 21:57:29 How is this any different than our dependence on  oil from the Middle East ( Saudi Arabia, for example).
1196 2018-07-11 21:57:23 To heal a pimple quickly, apply tea tree oil on pimple every few hours, and apply vitamin E oil on the spot, about 1 hour before bedtime.
1197 2018-07-11 21:57:13 Get a toner from Superdrug and get some natural coconut oil  (solid) for conditioning. Also buy some purple shampoo, leave it on for 3 minutes. May not even it out if it's patchy but will help x
1198 2018-07-11 21:57:08 Why did you conspire with Putin to transfer ownership of 19% of Russian oil titan Rosneft in exchange for sanctions relief?

That was a rhetorical question.  Robert Mueller already knows why.
1199 2018-07-11 21:57:06 Well it was not their oil till the Australian  exploration found oil not where they expected it. Had the geology been different no one would know it existed
1200 2018-07-11 21:57:04 I don't watch much TV honestly.  I've done plenty of reading on the subject.  China capped oil into NK and haltED steel purchases in January.  The oil cap is major.  You're simply someone who will never see this admin in an unbiased fashion.  That's pretty much who you are.
1201 2018-07-11 21:56:53 Hands off our lands, Senator! NO leases for oil and gas companies. NO selling out our beautiful places to the highest bidders.

Disgraceful policy designed to confuse your constituents.

1228 2018-07-11 21:54:12 Just had a sensational hot bath with aloe vera dettol + foam bath, drenched my hair and body in coconut oil.

I’m about to have the best sleep I’ve had in ages.
1229 2018-07-11 21:54:12 Holy cow, the twitter #strawban storm is all kinds of .

Even setting aside all the #ableism, how many people don't realize plastics are made from oil? 

That if there's no plan to pump less oil, whatever was used to make plastic straws will be turned into...other plastics?
1230 2018-07-11 21:54:05 Look into hydrogen peroxide therapy. Check  it out on YouTube I believe there’s some benefits to this. I found a mixture of collide silver,oil of oregano and frankincense oil added to distilled water in a diffuser helped me breathe when I was at the worst for breathing.Copd sucks
1231 2018-07-11 21:53:51 i just massaged fallon’s paws with coconut oil and archimedes was watching all jealously so i tried to massage his and he hissed at me so fuck me i guess
1232 2018-07-11 21:53:50 The amount of people angry that SWA is no longer serving peanuts on flights is astonishing. There's a reason why some schools don't allow anything made w peanuts/PB/PB oil - some people while in confined spaces can still have a severe allergic reaction from airoborne exposure.
1233 2018-07-11 21:53:42 is that oil or something else ??? 
1234 2018-07-11 21:53:40 and that’s why he got angry with Germany for buy so much russian oil
1235 2018-07-11 21:53:37 Donald dumbass trump made a statement in Brussels, that Russia controls Germany over Germany purchasing gas and oil from Russia. So does this mean that Canada controls the USA over America purchasing oil from Canada.???? Maybe Canada should turn the taps off to trump.
1236 2018-07-11 21:53:35 List of what we have to do before the beach: Hair app.,Nail app.,Carwash and oil change,Pack suitcases and carryons,Grocery shop etc.

What we have done: Bought cute outfits for family beach pic, Set up my camera equip,Bought candy and games,Saved money for a year!!!!!!!!
1237 2018-07-11 21:53:30 Your points are rather meaningless. We get a large supply of our oil from Saudi Arabia, home to 9/11 terrorists and from Venezuela, who’s residents can’t even travel to the US because of the travel ban. Are we in cahoots or controlled by eithe country?
1238 2018-07-11 21:53:29 Not to mention advanced statistical methods. The average physician has next to no ability to distinguish good methods from snake oil in an era of noninferiority trials, Bayesian analyses, and adaptive randomization @RSiemieniuk
1239 2018-07-11 21:53:22 Argan oil is amazing for your skin, nails, and hair! It is made from a tree that withstands all kinds of harsh weather.
1240 2018-07-11 21:53:14 @ASavageNation Michael you are so right about tech companies skating on antitrust.  It may have something to do with them   being considered smarter than the rest of us.  When it was oil or steel the "intelligentsia" supported regulation.  Now the intelligentsia are intimidated
1241 2018-07-11 21:53:08 Lol well when your engine starts smelling and your car hesitates it’s probably time to get the oil changed
1242 2018-07-11 21:53:00 so what you’re saying is if I brought you mint chocolate chip ice cream and ice cream with castor oil in it, you’d choose the latter?
1243 2018-07-11 21:52:43 "Where I go, the oil will flow." If u r led by Holy Spirit u don't think the oil & the glory will be w/ u? No more excuses. Go!
1244 2018-07-11 21:52:37 This man asked could he oil my thighs on my next vacation ... WITH BABY OIL! he trying to kill me . WTF BLOCKED!
1245 2018-07-11 21:52:24 a letra de coconut oil da lizzo é genial queria tatuar ela toda no meu corpo
1246 2018-07-11 21:52:04 I just took a patchouli & clove bud oil infused bath - exfoliated with an olive oil•green tea•avocado oil scrub - guess you could say I stepped out feeling pretty damn godly.
1247 2018-07-11 21:51:49 Mi is surrounded by clean water that you can literally drink. Its pure Michigan stupidity. Just like keeping that 60+ year old Enbridge oil pipeline running through the fresh water. That will be the real water crisis. Like Kalamazoo oil spill, but in the lake.
1248 2018-07-11 21:51:38 When was the last time you checked your oil? Or had someone check it for you
1249 2018-07-11 21:51:35 He fights for the farmers, coal miners, auto workers, steel workers, oil workers, and anyone else who wants a job here in the US. A lot of these people used to vote Democrat. They are finding out the Dems didn't care if they worked or not. They will be voting for POTUS in 2020!
1250 2018-07-11 21:51:29 Hey. Just because I’m an anarchist that doesn’t mean I can’t enjoy watching politics in action. Also, if you don’t like me saying Trump was stupid for going after Germany for buying oil from Russia, you don’t have to DM me and give me your “I thought you were cool” spiel.

1252 2018-07-11 21:51:20 Are you saying that you put on my makeup when I leave and take it off before I get home.... with coconut oil
1253 2018-07-11 21:51:19 Increasing fish oil (omega 3) while decreasing processed foods (omega 6) works wonders on inflammation!
1254 2018-07-11 21:51:16 And how many oil companies are tied to the NOC in Tripoli?  Hmm How many?  You are very transparent
1255 2018-07-11 21:51:13 Oil to 66?
1256 2018-07-11 21:51:09 Really Hugh?  You are so much smarter than this thoughtless comment.  And the swipe at NATO members and Russian gas and oil is not only petty but, I’d like to think, beneath you.  Maybe you should give this more thought.
1257 2018-07-11 21:51:01 I thought about that after I posted it. Oil based. Grocery uses Raid.
1258 2018-07-11 21:50:57 you need to oil up them hinges
1259 2018-07-11 21:50:50 really? he's calling o Germany to stop buying oil from Russia and instead buy it from America. How is that loyalty to Putin?. The alliances with freeloaders European Countries need to be revise
1260 2018-07-11 21:50:45 We need to build oil refineries!  We used to have small refineries in each State. But no longer,  dumb EPA destroyed them.We haven't had any built since 1970s. Lots of oil but no refineries!  We need more now! Then we'll be fine!
1261 2018-07-11 21:50:33 I love the way our POTUS called-out out the German Chancellor after they recently signed to have Russia provide 70% of their natural gas and oil for billions of dollars. Russia will have Germany by the balls
1262 2018-07-11 21:50:28 Can liberal Democrats and our so-called “allies” really be considered allies when they repeatedly undermine our interests by making uranium/oil/gas deals with our adversaries like Russia and Iran?
1263 2018-07-11 21:50:26 Simple, that is what happens if you read what you want to read

If the conservative government had chosen the Oil welfare fund as Norway done, there would be wealth instead of poverty and depravity

Explain that

But jumping to conclusions once again
1264 2018-07-11 21:50:18 Ranch is buttermilk. 

Also mayo is just eggs and oil so technically cake has mayo in it.
1265 2018-07-11 21:50:14 Getting my oil changed and there's this fuckin cute ass baby staring at me.
1266 2018-07-11 21:50:13 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS since these other countries can't pay 2%... Then let us pay 1% until 2024 as well or untill they buy oil from us...
1267 2018-07-11 21:50:07 There’s a special place in hell for a person who needs a oil change at 6.00 pm
1268 2018-07-11 21:49:47 That’s olbas oil and some other shit  jheez really roasted me there
1269 2018-07-11 21:49:46 Read your book , drink your green tea put that castor oil on your hair ( lol it helps with hair growth) and calamine on your skin before you pass out and pray to Jehovah & repeat everything else will fall into place. 
1270 2018-07-11 21:49:37 Who do oil changes and coolant flushes for a decent price!? All my little lights on the dash finna be on. Lol! This my first car, yall. I don't be knowing stuff. Lmfao!!!
1271 2018-07-11 21:49:19 Or, they should be sent to Saudi Arabia to protest oil shipments THERE.
1272 2018-07-11 21:49:17 Ana Navarro is mocking Trump's election saying he's "controlled" by Russia while at the same time mocking Trump for trying to eliminate a source of oil income to Russia, the alleged controller of Trump.  Scary she thought that was logic, scary over 50k bots thought so too.
1273 2018-07-11 21:49:14 #England, do not invade #Croatia. There is no oil there for you to steal. It's enough with #Iraq and #IKEA.

1275 2018-07-11 21:48:36 Wow. WTI oil fell by $3.73 today alone, a drop of 5% from the previous day. Brent oil had a worse day and dropped by $5.46, a 7% decrease and the largest drop since February 2016.
1276 2018-07-11 21:48:36 U don't complicate Sheep tripe with all these Rajah,jikelele soup and Knorrox u add White Pepper,salt and bit of oil and that's it done nice and Skoen

1278 2018-07-11 21:48:16 If I started a premium snap, would yall pay to see me eat wings? I’ll have my shirt off covered in coconut oil. Will include grunts and moans for tips.
1279 2018-07-11 21:48:07 When you're hard pressed, the oil of God's Anointing should flow out of you. We are God's chosen vessels of honor, showing forth His praises!

1286 2018-07-11 21:47:11 i need more wild hair growth oil but that jon 10 dollars
1287 2018-07-11 21:47:06 Freddy, they are probably right, but you just have to look at Norway to see how badly the U.K. Government has managed oil revenue. I'm sure it would be criminal in other countries.
1288 2018-07-11 21:47:01 Maybe oil will follow spx lower to $66?
1289 2018-07-11 21:46:57 Yeah that we told we bring oil to that Stephan Harper set up before our new PM killed Alberta industry screwed NB and basically left any atlantic customer out of our oil market.
1290 2018-07-11 21:46:43 Based on trump logic, America is controlled by terrorists. We get most oil from the Saudis and they sent us death on 9/11. Just hope Putin doesn't find out that he's not really the one controlling his cheeto.

1295 2018-07-11 21:45:58 Coconut oil levels low
1296 2018-07-11 21:45:58 Global benchmark Brent #crude oil had its biggest one-day drop in two years on Wednesday as escalating U.S.-China trade tensions threatened to hurt oil demand, and news that #Libya would reopen its ports raised expectations of growing supply.
1297 2018-07-11 21:45:52 John, that’s the reason you were never President.  I’m glad he finally called Germany out.  Every winter the EU pays homage to Putin because of their reliance on heating oil.  It’s like a two faced friend, best to air it out now.
1298 2018-07-11 21:45:45 The biggest crock of garbage is the CME Exchange reporting a technical problem That is the biggest bullshit I have ever seen. Me thinks it had to do with OIL even though I had to no position in it but I am looking to buy right around here. Will post an update shortly. Big scam
1299 2018-07-11 21:45:43 This lavender oil when I mixed it in with my black soap actually helped me calmed down just a tad bit.
1300 2018-07-11 21:45:33 I love lemongrass too. I have these stones that I bought from a lady who infused them with lemongrass, and lavender, and she told me lemongrass helped with anxiety. Years later I decided I needed to just keep the oil around. Did some research and it helps with anxiety
1301 2018-07-11 21:45:27 China rapidly increased purchases of American soybeans and crude oil before tariffs went into effect, temporarily boosting economic growth
1302 2018-07-11 21:45:21 The art of the deal! In other words we’ll settle for bet 2.5&3% and buy American not Russian oil! Logic common sense will prevail. We have the upper hand. We the #1 consumers in the world
1303 2018-07-11 21:45:21 I got some snake oil to cure some stuff too
1304 2018-07-11 21:45:01 I'll wipe your tears away for free loser

1305 2018-07-11 21:44:58 well... I'll never purchase another @Lucas_Oil product...
1306 2018-07-11 21:44:49 I STILL haven’t gotten my brakes changed, my oil changed, and new tires 
I need to get my life changed!

1309 2018-07-11 21:44:38 At my old Sears, retail on a synthetic oil change and tire rotation would have been $80 with standard coupons. I’m at Valvoline and it’s $115.

1312 2018-07-11 21:44:19 Umm from my understanding of economics Ukraine was indebted to Russia for oil and gas payments by 20 years.... They were having issues long before Maidan. #FactsMatter
1313 2018-07-11 21:44:13 China rapidly increased purchases of American soybeans and crude oil before tariffs went into effect, temporarily boosting economic growth
1314 2018-07-11 21:44:09 And the U.S. benefits by having around 21 military facilities in Germany. 

Don;t rock the boat,, david spratt. Because Germany has enough money, know-how and technology to use those bases for other things.

1319 2018-07-11 21:43:47 ...[Paulie] had this wonderful system for doing the garlic. He used a razor, and he used to slice it so thin that it used to liquefy in the pan with just a little oil. It was a very good system.
1320 2018-07-11 21:43:47 We would join the Beautiful USA.  They would appreciate our oil, farm lands., water, people.
1321 2018-07-11 21:43:17 So? Let NATO be NATO and Russia can deal with that. Meanwhile, let's help our own people instead of wasting money on other people's armies. Let's drill our own oil. Let's just be America.

1323 2018-07-11 21:43:09 @JoeNBC Trump rails on Germany gas pipeline with Russia. What about US dependence on Saudi oil while they supported terrorists?
1324 2018-07-11 21:43:08 .@ronmknox, all campaign contributions are public, unlike @mattbrownforgov's secret Global Zero donors. Does anyone believe big oil, corporations and Republicans don't contribute to @mattbrownforgov's dark money think tank? Who are the donors?
1325 2018-07-11 21:43:06 True. I do not live near you. But we have farming here too. And, we have tons of sugar cane fields that can be wiped out with one hurricane. Also, salt mines. Our oil field had picked up. I can honestly say things are getting better.
1326 2018-07-11 21:42:46 Trump: Germany is controlled by Russia.

It's all about Russian  "gas and oil" 

Germany gets its gas from Putin therefore Merkel keeps silent against Russian aggression and do not support US against them.

1327 2018-07-11 21:42:45 I wonder how old this oil filter is
1328 2018-07-11 21:42:35 Saudi Arabia was heavily involved in the 9/11 attacks yet you brag about huge arms deals and you purchase massive amounts of oil from them.

1332 2018-07-11 21:42:03 Oh MEATHEAD , it's ok w you that NATO, whose purpose is to curtail Russian aggression, allows Germany to give Russia millions for gas and oil, thus becoming dependent on them for 70% of their energy??? Liberalism is mental !
1333 2018-07-11 21:42:00 Seeing how angry you are today tells me for certain that the raspberry flavored anal lube you asked me to send still hasn't gotten there yet.  I know its not as yummy but maybe you can use some olive oil or butter or something?  How's those hemorrhoids today, sweety?
1334 2018-07-11 21:41:55 With all due respect this restructuring venture is inconsequential as regards to your primary assignment as a governor. You took an author to protect life and promote welfare to Baylesans. Bayelsa needs restructuring more as oil producing communities are denied by the 13%.

1339 2018-07-11 21:41:26 Trump says Germany is captive to Russia because they get oil from them, does that mean we’re captive to Canada? What the Hell is going on?

1346 2018-07-11 21:40:58 Hi Adam. Your pizza with spinach and motor oil will be delivered in 36 min via train.
1347 2018-07-11 21:40:57 I read some tinfoiling about how conservative media hates him since electric cars threaten the economies dependency on oil. So they constantly paint him in a bad light.
1348 2018-07-11 21:40:53 wish i had a girl to give fire ass baby oil massages too .
1349 2018-07-11 21:40:48 #CrudeOil closed sharply lower on Wednesday as a report showing the largest weekly decline in domestic crude supplies in nearly two years failed to ease concerns surrounding a likely rise in Libyan oil exports and potential for weaker demand tied to the U.S.-China trade dispute.
1350 2018-07-11 21:40:47 You don't have to dig too hard to find @SenBooker's own ties to Russian oil and gas, oligarchs, banks, etc.  Greenberg Traurig, where Rudy Giuliani was recently "global chairman", gives a lot of money to Booker.  So does Sullivan and Cromwell.  #Russiagate

1353 2018-07-11 21:40:37 I have come across many Scottish people who are very friendly but the bottom line is that they don’t support us in any sport and think we have taken their oil revenue from them. They don’t recognise that the taxes collected all over the UK supports them too

1357 2018-07-11 21:40:14 Phillip, will YOU PLEASE quit falling for TRUMPS LUNATIC BANTER. None of Trumps hostility has anything to do with spending or natural gas or oil. HE IS DOING PUTINS BIDDING PERIOD. He has to bring down Angela Merkel to topple the EU. WHY CANT YOU SEE THAT???  OPEN your eyes.
1358 2018-07-11 21:40:12 This is not always true. I am living proof of this.  The cbd does nothing for my pain unless it is with an indica thc product. I also use rick simpson oil at night in place of a break through pain med of ten mg oxycodone i used to take every night.  I have read so many studies.
1359 2018-07-11 21:40:12 You must be slow.  Trump is driving the EU to shore up its defenses and stop handing Russian billions in oil/gas revenue.
1360 2018-07-11 21:40:06 全ての油という油に感謝しているよ。
1361 2018-07-11 21:39:47 Weekly Technical Perspective on the Crude Oil Prices
1362 2018-07-11 21:39:45 Safe travels. I was gonna make something but forgot the oil so now I gotta figure out something.
1363 2018-07-11 21:39:42 Yes & they put people in prison for cannabis oil to help people beat cancer while protecting big pharma's for peddling poison.  A very strange world indeed.
1364 2018-07-11 21:39:36 All Russia has is oil and natural gas. Today Trump just stuck it right up the ass of the Russians. Trump was telling other nations not to buy the oil and gas from Russia. Their economy would collapse.

1367 2018-07-11 21:39:10 FLASH: Portuguese construction company Mota-Engil SGPS SA is looking at projects in Nigeria worth as much as 1.5 billion euros ($1.8 billion) after signing a joint venture with a local company to enter Africa’s largest economy and the continent’s biggest oil producer.
1368 2018-07-11 21:38:56 Only I don't know if this totally qualifies BUT here goes.
During the Ebola scare, I worked at an oil & gas company. CEO put my direct boss in charge of ordering supplies to keep the office sanitary. She wanted to order bleach wipes for surfaces and hands (1)
1369 2018-07-11 21:38:48 Get some extra virgin olive oil, ask the Lord to bless it for anointing oil. Anoint him and you in the name of Jesus Christ. Every day. Every day!!!

1371 2018-07-11 21:38:30 @MichelePowers14 I get very political on here. Please don’t get upset...lol PS. I’m dying to try CBD oil
1372 2018-07-11 21:38:18 google search: can i od on hemp oil ?
1373 2018-07-11 21:38:15 If Trump was so concerned about Germany's fuel imports from Russia, then he should first turn the tap off of Venezuelan oil imports to the USA. But we would never do due to the HUGE D.C. oil lobby = donations. #DrainThatSwamp
1374 2018-07-11 21:38:11 @realDonaldTrump dickhead we will purchase oil from Iran through Euro exchange or gold.
Bharat is a great nation.
You boot lickers we know how to mend & bend you.
Keep pompoe in your pocket.
1375 2018-07-11 21:37:55 My mom knows how bad my anxiety has been lately so she got me a little roll on anxiety relief oil and my heart is so warm :)
1376 2018-07-11 21:37:38 You mean oil paintings of bored-looking Dutchmen contemplating their flock of sheep under a game title made in WordArt are no longer all the rage? What a time to be alive.
1377 2018-07-11 21:37:18 Our "allies" are giving Putin billions for oil & gas but won't meet their fiscal obligations to NATO.

Merkel is funding Russia & refusing to fund defense against Russia.

Nancy, you're out of your mind.
1378 2018-07-11 21:37:14 Years ago when I worked in Nigeria - one of the regional chiefs and there were several had taken so much oil money [illegally] and put it in his Swiss Bank account[s] that he could have paid off the national debt many times over and that was just one regional chief !
1379 2018-07-11 21:37:13 They remind me of Ansel Adams photos of Manzanar. His photos showed a view of the concentration camp without the barbed wire and guard towers. if the Int. Dept. cameras were turned the other way would we see bull dozers, oil/gas wells, mines, or weapons dumps?
1380 2018-07-11 21:37:11 And yet you keep supporting policies that endanger all of our ocean life just for more oil. How will subsistence hunters live when you've enabled the destruction of all their food?
1381 2018-07-11 21:37:10 Piss Chisel
1382 2018-07-11 21:37:04 It's not even falling except in the fictional tales the media tells. How much oil is under Venezuela again? And no, they don't eat rats.
1383 2018-07-11 21:37:03 There's alot to take in abt that GOP visit to Moscow. All I'm saying is keep an eye on those sanctions and the oil.
1384 2018-07-11 21:36:57 Freah tomatoes with sliced Jalapenos and Basel from our garden.  With a little olive oil salt and pepper.
1385 2018-07-11 21:36:43 And where do we get our oil from? Also, Germany is controlled by Russia you say? I don’t hear Germany calling for Russia to be added back into the G-7, saying Putin’s a very fine person
1386 2018-07-11 21:36:19 Instead of England playing Belgium on Saturday for 3rd place, I’d like to see @BorisJohnson & @guyverhofstadt have a bare knuckle fight covered in crisp & dry cooking oil, winner takes all

1390 2018-07-11 21:36:07 Reasonably stable ingredients:
Flour 
Sugar (white & brown)
Oats
Corn meal
Baking powder / soda 
Honey
Oil
Vinegar (red wine &/or cider)
Salt & pepper
Baking spices: cinnamon/ginger
Herbs: basil, oregano, thyme
Savories: paprika, cumin, chile powder, garlic powder, onion powder
1391 2018-07-11 21:36:07 Olive oil eco styler. I put product underneath like an oil or a light creme so my hair stays soft but that shit will leave your hair FRIZZLESS & so defined... also great for taming your edges 
1392 2018-07-11 21:35:57 My nuts are $1.80 a bag from Countdown, cheap as, don't need oil.
1393 2018-07-11 21:35:36 精神的にきつい
1394 2018-07-11 21:35:34 Have at it, I say. Might be able to make a go of it with all that oil & natural gas (though the economy would be super-cyclical). They're basically break-even on federal fund flows.
1395 2018-07-11 21:35:25 has improved .. Over 3 yrs ago a GP wanted to hospitalised me with a supposedly pending STROKE which I’m still awaiting.. The USA Dietician put me on Cold Press Coconut Oil which reduced my LDL and increased my HDL. No Dietician in Brisbane could suggest....
1396 2018-07-11 21:34:59 The garlic liquifies when it hits the oil
1397 2018-07-11 21:34:55 Quit FEEDING TRUMPS LUNATIC NOTIONS. This was NEVER about spending. Or gas and oil. He IS DOING PUTINS BIDDING PERIOD. WHY CANT YOU SEE THAT.  ITS TO distract from Muellers investigation of RUSSIA, which got him elected and his ALLIANCE WITH PUTIN.
1398 2018-07-11 21:34:40 Croatia beat us. England stole our gold, art, men and oil. There are level to this hatred
1399 2018-07-11 21:34:33 i use olive oil as lube for butt sex. extra virgin
1400 2018-07-11 21:34:33 The EU is Free because of America. What about the Middle East Rich with Oil and they pay hardly nothing. Lock up Trump 
1401 2018-07-11 21:34:32 Yes, my counterpoint is you don’t understand where countries are on Earth not anything about geopolitics. If you did then you would already know why a lot of Europe has to get gas and oil from Russia. I don’t see US offering us an alternative.
1402 2018-07-11 21:34:29 DaddyBear:  I'd like to get your thoughts on how the 12 million barrel DRAW on crude oil inventories will effect prices over the next few days... It seems to me it was COMPLETELY ignored this morning at 9:30 Central Time but should possibly have an effect soon.... TIA.
1403 2018-07-11 21:34:09 Indeed! Low oil price is not the same lever it was for regan when EU now gets all its gas from the Caspian and not the North Sea
1404 2018-07-11 21:34:05 Olive oil might do the job
1405 2018-07-11 21:33:55 Attacking oil rich nation(s) under known false pretenses & hunting down civilians is pretty provable. It's even been nicely compiled by legal experts a decade ago, but the DNC declined so it became a history footnote.
1406 2018-07-11 21:33:50 So very proud of President Trump making very clear that the USA will no longer foot the bills for NATO while  countries like Germany have become totally dependent on them for gas and oil!  #NATOSummit2018
1407 2018-07-11 21:33:41 Basing my lavendar essential oil purchases on who wins the #WorldCup
1408 2018-07-11 21:33:36 Of course Pres recommending Germany buy oil from US or other countries not beholden to Russia is certainly done to help Russia. Really? What is wrong with some who comment? And why shouldn’t a wealthy nations like Germany and France pay more for their own protection? #WalkAway
1409 2018-07-11 21:33:25 Solid advice.
1410 2018-07-11 21:33:24 .@TheJuanWilliams is perplexed how US oil might get to Europe.
I wonder if it ever occurred to him how Middle Eastern oil got to the US?

1413 2018-07-11 21:32:48 Maddow is a snake oil salesperson.  Don’t fool yourself.
1414 2018-07-11 21:32:48 And anything but green. Need arox 100 gallons of oil for cooling, oil that require regular changing, they catch fire and must burn out while dumping oil on ground. Built on large pads of cement that leech lime into the ground
1415 2018-07-11 21:32:48 This guy is all over the place. I don't own it and won't.  No focus on core business
1416 2018-07-11 21:32:37 Must be the same family/corporation as bought the naming rights of Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis? The Pence connection makes sense.
1417 2018-07-11 21:32:23 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.
1418 2018-07-11 21:32:23 From what I remember I did that.. with oil n garlic 
1419 2018-07-11 21:32:18 Where does the US get the majority of its oil???
1420 2018-07-11 21:32:18 Oil drops 5% today and airline stocks drop. Doesn’t make sense. We’re there that many cancelled flights to China?
1421 2018-07-11 21:32:15 I actually take CBD oil!!
1422 2018-07-11 21:32:13 What do you expect?  1)Trade war threats, 2) rising oil prices.  The writing has been on the wall, guys.
1423 2018-07-11 21:32:09 That is possible. That also is not the argument I was refuting. It's also possible that Russia breaks the entire European NATO alliance by cutting off natural gas and oil supplies in January. After a few million Germans freeze to death, the rest will fall.
1424 2018-07-11 21:31:58 ALERT: THE ROOF AND WINDOW IS OPEN ON LUCAS OIL STADIUM.
1425 2018-07-11 21:31:57 Top 5 source countries of U.S. petroleum importing 2017, Canada, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, and Venezuela, which trump threatened to attack. Venezuela largest importer of crude oil to U.S. Why get on Germany for dealing with Russia? Facade to look strong against Russia?
1426 2018-07-11 21:31:54 Had a neck oil yesterday to taste the Heineken effect. It was excellent. Would happily drink again.
1427 2018-07-11 21:31:50 I don't know about internally.  But I love my coconut oil for boo boo's and bruises.  Heal much faster
1428 2018-07-11 21:31:44 Oil and gas is tanked every day. And even if it costs more - so what. You don’t ask your partner to defend you from a potential enemy while you give the potential enemy the resources needed to attack you. Shut down Russian oil and gas exports and Europe become safer quickly.
1429 2018-07-11 21:31:37 Essential Oil For Chakra Healing

Sandalwood, patchouli, orange, rose and ylang-ylang essential oils can be used as aromatherapy for second chakra healing. These can be used alone, in meditation, and in conjunction with chakra crystals.
1430 2018-07-11 21:31:35 When someone pegs a reason/factor for recent #distillate, #diesel demand drop that will be interesting. Less use by #energy industry? or #agriculture, #farming sector on #tariff, #TradeWar worry? Or just a slip from very robust demand and nothing to worry about #OOTT #energy #oil
1431 2018-07-11 21:31:33 For real though I feel your pain I got burned a few weeks back by hot oil which wasn’t fun
1432 2018-07-11 21:31:30 Then you better oil your blade cause that stuff is nasty 
1433 2018-07-11 21:31:12 Hmm, Dont know.... But the other one doesn't .... I suppose different nuts have different oil content?
1434 2018-07-11 21:31:05 Libs:  Germany NEEDS this pipeline to obtain cheap gas/oil as there is no other way to get it 
Also Libs :  Climb trees and chain themselves to equipment to prevent pipelines in the US from bringing cheap gas/oil
1435 2018-07-11 21:31:02 Additionally Germany benefits economically from U.S troops there and bases. Dollars from taxpayers pay for it all, then flow into German econ.
1436 2018-07-11 21:30:45 And the purpose of the pipeline expansion is not to replace this train but to carry the huge quantity of extra oil planned for the incoming years.
1437 2018-07-11 21:30:42 Sounds like us tbh
1438 2018-07-11 21:30:41 Here let me make it simple for you. Trump gets NATO members to pay more= stronger NATO. Trump gets NATO members to buy oil and gas elsewhere= hurt Russia's economy. Trump uses these tools to put Putin in check! easy pesy. Go back to history class! You failed!
1439 2018-07-11 21:30:41 ?  Arena in reproduction How to solve the babies and watch the fruits and these amounts of these types of air in the sky and sand between large and bright room rooms like  ?  Life first?  The life and the first of the first oil soldier
1440 2018-07-11 21:30:38 Yea that’s why Saudi opened the tap on the oil.  That’s why he’s the first president NoKo would meet with.  That’s why there’s a red carpet waiting wherever he goes.  Tell Bob to put a Corker in it.
1441 2018-07-11 21:30:38 Germany buys their energy from Russia, Trump calls-them-out, before the WORLD. Because, How can an Alliance, like NATO, be prepared to confront, Russia, when the leading European Power/Ally? is dependent on Russia, for energy? They could buy from an Ally, U.S. Oil/Gas.

1445 2018-07-11 21:30:21 You mean saying that Germany shouldn't be buying oil from Russia, the country we are supposed to be protecting them from, the same country you believe hacked our election. I guess it's ok for Germany to be close to Russia then? #Hypocrite
1446 2018-07-11 21:30:20 I think you misunderstand, Trump was saying Germany was out of line with its oil pipeline to Russia even though it was done when Crimea had not yet been taken over,  Trump is Putin's biggest defender and continues to provide Putin's innocence statement as his proof.

1449 2018-07-11 21:30:13 And you get oil from Saudi Arabia, guess you forgave them for their part in 9/11. Or you think that was an inside job. Sovereign countries can do what they want.

1451 2018-07-11 21:29:49 #hugs oy I'm sorry. Are you feeling any better? Also,  have you ever tried, lemongrass essential oil? I take few drops and pour it into my hands and rub it underneath my underarms each morning. Then tends to keep me calm throughout the day, and my anxiety hasn't been flaring up.
1452 2018-07-11 21:29:30 Yep considering some garages are now HIGHER than BEFORE the price drop a few weeks ago yet oil was about the same before it dropped!
1453 2018-07-11 21:29:21 I’ve heard from lots of folks (including in the oil patch) that strategically voted NDP because they knew the province would go Wildrose... and we all know what happened next.
1454 2018-07-11 21:29:09 Long term study. We’re attempting to pull together years of data after and actually before (forgot about the 80s data I need to get too) the Valdez oil spill and see if we can identify factors related to change in the area which might not be related to the spill.
1455 2018-07-11 21:29:06 I am going to conjure up some "simmering the rage' oil. 

Thank you for sharing
1456 2018-07-11 21:28:49 Sorry but we subsidize the shit out of car drivers. How many wars have we put on the credit card to protect oil supplies? And how much will it cost to reverse climate change? Will car drivers pay those bills??? I think not.
1457 2018-07-11 21:28:45 @bus_tweet2 The motor will have started up, and darkness like a swift film of oil closes down to the water's edge, to drink their fill.
1458 2018-07-11 21:28:44 Had to look that one up and found a video where a woman extolls the virtues of krill oil by saying that it's what makes whales so smart. 
1459 2018-07-11 21:28:42 How long can I go without getting my oil changed? I don’t feel like it sitting at the dealership and I don’t have an appointment 
1460 2018-07-11 21:28:39 I apparently became an @autozone employee today.  Employee behind the counter took me to the backroom so I could dump my own used oil .  Then he and the manager proceeded to screw up my return after explaining it three times 
1461 2018-07-11 21:28:31 We hv crude oil, and what is ur own state contribution
1462 2018-07-11 21:28:16 Question for the left: If Trump is 'Putin's puppet,' why is he telling other world leaders to not buy Russian oil and gas at NATO?
1463 2018-07-11 21:28:12 American oil stocks are now at the lowest level since February of 2015, flying in the face of bumper production. The refineries are in overdrive for this time of year, even as utilization fell slightly. Exports are still over 2 million barrels a day.
1464 2018-07-11 21:28:10 Indeed. Big fan of wind and solar. Nevertheless the 3% of U.K. energy it supplies won’t match the 75% oil and gas supplies for quite some time soon. Assuming the U.K. meets all carbon targets it’s 1300BCM of gas imports without shale gas according to @nationalgriduk
1465 2018-07-11 21:28:04 Use CBD oil (3) x a day you will sleep amazing.
1466 2018-07-11 21:28:00 And we get most of our oil through Venezuela.

1479 2018-07-11 21:26:40 I might have heard him wrong, but I thought he said in October. Also said something about a Brent crude oil meltdown because Croatia would win...just kidding
1480 2018-07-11 21:26:34 Haha, wise up you clown, for your knowledge Aberdeen is the oil capital of Europe, probably more money here than half of England 
1481 2018-07-11 21:26:33 True touché on the billions in subsidies on oil and gas, good point. I’m generally against subsidies across the board.
1482 2018-07-11 21:26:04 I cleaned out my car, took it through the car wash, vacuumed it, and then grabbed motor oil at Tractor Supply. All of this, done WITH my TWO German Shepherds. Applause, please. Both dogs at once at Tractor Supply. A monumental feat.
1483 2018-07-11 21:26:03 All done with episode 1. I was always suspicious of the RexT/Exxon ties to Russian oil. I read Russia annexed Crimea to have access to a shipping lane for oil. Thoughts?
1484 2018-07-11 21:26:02 They don't speak out to oppose it either.  They are big oil and gas.
1485 2018-07-11 21:26:01 It rubs the oil on its skin
1486 2018-07-11 21:25:50 Our largest oil import is from Canada. It is also projected that US import of oil will drop 60% from 2017.
1487 2018-07-11 21:25:45 oil imports that is
1488 2018-07-11 21:25:40 Shit you change the oil I'll cook!

1490 2018-07-11 21:25:21 #UKOG Lower oil prices puts demand and pressure on large off shore exploration and development. Onshore developments are a better long term hold with known resources for that reason I believe #ukog and similar businesses are in a stronger position. LTH
1491 2018-07-11 21:25:13 U.S. spend a lot on military (not properly 'defense') because U.S. want to be the one and only Superpower with hands on oil, markets and influence.

There ain't such thing as a free lunch.
1492 2018-07-11 21:25:08 I used to practice international climate change law and stopped because it was so devastating. Humans are all talk and no action. I am resigned to our fate and it makes me sad. Look into the public subsidies of oil and gas vs. renewables.

1496 2018-07-11 21:24:40 You were trying to buy the dip on oil, right?

1499 2018-07-11 21:24:07 Germany gives billions of dollars to Russia for oil and gas Germany is controlled by Putin. the European nations not contributing enough to Nato has need to be called out for long time. Time to stop the freeloaders. the short fall from the EU ends up coming from USA taxpayers

1504 2018-07-11 21:22:53 Hi! Since the flavor oil used in the Lip Butter is kosher certified, it may or may not be considered vegan. We are willing to check with the supplier for verification!
1505 2018-07-11 21:22:51 It should never have gotten to this point. We have the materials and the labor to be self-sufficient. We became self-sufficient with oil once our businesses were released from liberal oversight. The same can happen to ALL areas of the economy if dems kept out of office.
1506 2018-07-11 21:22:49 Grabbed boneless pork ribs before running from store yesterday. 

Eaten this 2 nights in a row:
- cut into bite-ish-sized pieces
- throw in wok
- 1tbsp minute miso, few dashes soy sauce, 1tbsp minced ginger, few dashes sesame oil
- stir fry til done, add baby bok choy towards end

1511 2018-07-11 21:22:06 US funding of NATO allows Germany to pay Russia for Oil and Fund further open border policies $ are fungible. Using 2025 Target is a delaying ploy.
1512 2018-07-11 21:22:05 They need to be trading energy with us ie, gas, coal, oil for our protection.
1513 2018-07-11 21:22:04 On course 4 what?4 failure?he has borrowed more money in 3yrs than 16yrs of PDP yet no projects..mind u in 99 when OBJ came oil prices were $15 pa barrel yet he didn't lament or blame he did his job..I agree with u under pmb security is a disaster.he should go & rest come 2019
1514 2018-07-11 21:22:03 We have the best oil palm research facility in the world.
1515 2018-07-11 21:22:03 Seems like Germany is ...I haven’t requested help-from our government against Russia NOR DO I PURCHASE OIL FROM RUSSIA ! Germans are scum .. always have been and will be .. use USA as a go between ? While funding the people they hate but support ? Scum ..
1516 2018-07-11 21:21:52 This skin care thing is becoming confusing I just started using coconut oil for my skin some few weeks back 
1517 2018-07-11 21:21:37 Renewables will be the future when big oil keeps trying to stop it. Big oil needs to go. Won't be easy but needs done (that doesn't mean it will be done). :-(
1518 2018-07-11 21:21:34 Does the US support Venezuela by buying their oil?
1519 2018-07-11 21:21:31 Reclaiming the Constitution by opposing a constitutionalist?
1520 2018-07-11 21:21:31 Or get some CBD oil.. works wonders for my Anxiety 
1521 2018-07-11 21:21:30 Nat Gas is Not Oil! They are our Allies! This is not a public debate! How would you like Russia telling us what we can do with our resources? Oh wait! I guess all Cult Wrong is OK with any Putin Con. EUR get it 3 RU routes all cheaper than liquified shipped. Can you Say GLUT?
1522 2018-07-11 21:21:29 If some NATO countries are not spending 2% of GNP on defense, it does not follow that the USA is paying more because they pay less.
Oh, and the gas pipeline has nothing at all to do with collective security although your pals in Big Oil are no doubt pissed about that!
1523 2018-07-11 21:21:27 Burns... Lucas Oil... it's like the arsonists are trolling us...

1527 2018-07-11 21:21:12 The garden haul is starting 
Tonight is pasta tossed with zucchini, peppers, sweet peas, and pesto alongside a garlicky beet salad. Only 5 of the ingredients in the meal (including salt and olive oil) aren't from the garden!
1528 2018-07-11 21:21:12 Jack Daniels BBQ smokey glaze goes amaaaaaaaazingly well with tofu. Fry some toasted sesame oil and you've got yourself a winner.
1529 2018-07-11 21:20:59 Coconut oil stay making me feel and look smexy.
1530 2018-07-11 21:20:58 Perhaps you ought to start looking into the oil welfare fund
Norway is leading the way ...meanwhile the Westminster government is sitting on debts...Better together...no thanks
1531 2018-07-11 21:20:56 PRESIDENT #TRUMP: “Well, I have to say, I think it’s very sad when #Germany makes a massive oil and gas deal with Russia, where you’re supposed to be guarding against #Russia, and Germany goes out and pays billions and billions of dollars a year to Russia
1532 2018-07-11 21:20:52 Spray yoself with eucalyptus oil! Mosquitos hate it :)
1533 2018-07-11 21:20:37 Whoever told you CBD oil is for pain is an idiot, its for anxiety, its a calmer. Also doses that work range in the 1000mg area.
1534 2018-07-11 21:20:36 Pshhh. You'll smell like salonpas and efficascent oil like me if you keep on doing that
1535 2018-07-11 21:20:27 Lmao bro you gotta get some Jamaican black castor oil b
1536 2018-07-11 21:20:19 Nothing about oil is good news. Toxic oil sands awful. Is this greater or lesser evil? Seems like everything that way now. Is fracking worth it to stop KSA? Maybe if we bought from Iran & Russia we'd have better relations but no one 2 blame 4 hacking elections
1537 2018-07-11 21:20:05 The only country that got full  stop help was the US. No other NATO country has needed it because we don't wage war for oil.
1538 2018-07-11 21:19:55 Yeah, I ask if something is 100% beef. Yet, I can't be %100 sure because they might be mixing the oil etc. Tricky.
1539 2018-07-11 21:19:55 there're places you can subscribe that'll tell you what you want to hear about gold too- "set to launch" "gold backed Yuan" "elite losing control" "reset" "gold oil triangle" "China to crush the dollar" "few understand" "hidden secrets" "SDRS" "gold moving west to east" "Sun Tzu"
1540 2018-07-11 21:19:53 1.  France sold Putin 3 aircraft carriers AFTER he invaded Georgia. 
2. EU and Germany are buying 80% or Russian gas and oil. 
3. All Russian oligarch money is in London
4. USA is only nation with proper sanctions against Russia

Clearly Europe is not that worried about Russia
1541 2018-07-11 21:19:45 Well Pakistani patients trust Indian doctors more than their own doctors;) Iran has huge trust in India.India is buying oil from Iran even during 2004 sanctions.That's why India Iran has defence pact deal;)
1542 2018-07-11 21:19:35 We pay billions to Mexico for oil also. Latin America and Nigeria too. tRump's believers are so damn dumb to fall for his bs.
1543 2018-07-11 21:19:32 WOW, Trump is working to stop Merkel/EU being dependant on gas/oil bought from Russia. They're lining Russian pockets with $ but want us to defend them from Russia. In what world does Merkel 's actions make sense? It's time for everyone to start paying the amounts due. Times up
1544 2018-07-11 21:19:32 Words matter. I will never be taxed by a tariff; I don't import. Just because prices may rise due to tariff doesn't mean the consumer is taxed. Same with quota or economic sanction in which no one is taxed. Ex: Sanction against Iran affects global oil supply & prices
1545 2018-07-11 21:19:19 @MSNBC @chucktodd Rex Tillerson was up to his neck in a oil with Russia that got killed by Ukraine santions. He became Sec't of State but Trump acts is critical of Merkel?
1546 2018-07-11 21:19:18 Would have been cute if Pop-eye took a drink of 'olive oil' after a can of spinach!
1547 2018-07-11 21:19:11 Cannabis oil.
1548 2018-07-11 21:19:09 Thats what she does. She puts tanning oil on, and then lays out at the pool.  (and then complains about being burnt afterwards. Lol)
1549 2018-07-11 21:19:07 今日は何オイルがいいかい?アロマオイルで香りたい?オリーブオイルでイタリアンたい?ふふふ…僕は君のためならどんなオイルにもなってやるさ…
1550 2018-07-11 21:19:03 I am a new follower. What a drop today in oil. Trying to understand if you expect to see more after today’s dramatic fall?
1551 2018-07-11 21:19:02 I'm Oil Can Harry! And I'm die!
1552 2018-07-11 21:19:00 I have used coconut oil on my skin and it was good. Body cream not touching your face,I totally agree.

@Imole_smallz lime is bad.
1553 2018-07-11 21:18:44 The article says that it was a flawed study & there’s no proof that canola oil causes dementia; so you’re good buying it.  :)
1554 2018-07-11 21:18:44 There are shampoos that can help strip the dye off your hair. After using it, warm up some coconut oil and then use it as a hair mask. Coconut oil is magical when it comes to hair.
1555 2018-07-11 21:18:40 bake at 400 for like 30 min or so with dry seasoning and oil....then grill med-high for like 3-4 min on each side (you can brush them with sauce before grill and when you flip them)   times vary a bit based on how much you are cooking
1556 2018-07-11 21:18:12 Good for a couple miles still, did you checked the oil ?
1557 2018-07-11 21:18:11 a blender that works by harnessing coconut oil
1558 2018-07-11 21:18:10 Man its hard work making sure all the welfare recipients get their money each month. I have spent the last 36 hours working on an oil rig. Need that overtime to pay for your asses to sit around all day and bitch about how hard life is.. #Liberals #Libtards #MAGA
1559 2018-07-11 21:18:07 We would make unbelievable headway if we could get a movement to stop funding colleges with state and federal dollars.
1560 2018-07-11 21:18:01 Car going in for fixing tomorrow, please send thoughts and prayers. in particular that I dont need a new oil sump. #teenagers
1561 2018-07-11 21:17:58 i told dinesh dsouza that baby oil is made from babies and he hasn’t stopped screaming into a tape recorder
1562 2018-07-11 21:17:58 Most energy requirements in industrialised countries are met through conventional sources such as oil, NG & NP. But here in Africa, the world is asking us to seek non-conventional sources.
1563 2018-07-11 21:17:58 I cannot understand why buying energy from Russia puts them under Russian control? We buy huge amounts of technology from China. We buy Oil from Iran and other middle eastern countries. We borrow huge amounts of money to cover deficits and we aren't controlled by China. Logic?
1564 2018-07-11 21:17:54 I give my dog CBD oil for seizures. Works great.
1565 2018-07-11 21:17:53 Less that and more Hitler’s tactics... only pushed on to Stalingrad because it was named after Stalin. Should have concentrated on the oil fields!
1566 2018-07-11 21:17:53 It's an oil you put under your tongue for 30 seconds or they have it in edible form or vape juice
1567 2018-07-11 21:17:49 Germany is not "in bed" with Russia. Russia has Europe over a barrel because of oil and natural gas. The best way to stop this is for the US to export and give Europe an alternative.
1568 2018-07-11 21:17:38 Absolutely.. eating more above ground low carb veggies, real grass fed meat, berries, free range eggs.. avoid Processed/Preserved n Pre-Packed junk food.. Use pure Cold Press Coconut Oil to cook with, turmeric, blk pepper, ginger, garlic, red onions..
1569 2018-07-11 21:17:34 Think about just with the oil and water. The water is just on you when you’re submerged
1570 2018-07-11 21:17:32 I've never heard of CBD oil before today, and this is legit the 3rd time today that I've heard mention of it. I think it might be a sign. I have major uncontrolled anxiety. How exactly do you use it?
1571 2018-07-11 21:17:26 Trump attacking Germany, since when did we stop importing oil from Russia?
1572 2018-07-11 21:17:21 Crude #oil #WTI down 4.7% today. #Copper ( a good gauge of #industry was down  3.1%
1573 2018-07-11 21:17:14 Croatia is hiding oil @realDonaldTrump
1574 2018-07-11 21:17:08 Nah u still owe that oil change lmao
1575 2018-07-11 21:17:07 @chucktodd Chuck, the question is why is the GOP so frighten of trump.  The GOP is weak & lacks a back bone. Now Trump talks about Germany buying oil & gas from Russia. Well why not Talk about keystone XL pipeline owned by a Canadian company Trans Canada. 
.
1576 2018-07-11 21:16:47 The Russians have the Germans by the balls with the oil/gas deal. All the Russians have to do is shut it off if Germany causes problems.
1577 2018-07-11 21:16:46 #India should not bow down to arm twisting by America. We need Iranian oil and the port to counter China.
1578 2018-07-11 21:16:46 What can I say? The heart wants what it wants.

Or maybe don't mix codeine with cannabis oil. And gin.
1579 2018-07-11 21:16:45 Did the oil have lots of vitamin E in it?
1580 2018-07-11 21:16:40 If Russia is a problem for you and  buying Russian oil perpetuates that. Why are you attacking and weakening the main defence against Russian expansion and aggression?
1581 2018-07-11 21:16:38 Bartender I’ve never spoke to: “Do you drive a Jeep?”
Me: “....... why -did I cut you off or hit your car?”
Bartender: “No I wish!”
*Talks to me how he saw me at the dealers getting an oil changed and tells me I looked cute* 
1582 2018-07-11 21:16:27 Where do you get you oil changed? I usually go to @jiffylube but  heir upsale process turns me off
1583 2018-07-11 21:16:17 What do you mean she? That’s a dude!!
1584 2018-07-11 21:16:15 Disgusting. Federal involvement should be nothing more than perhaps issuing a mandate that all provinces must supply a bus service to both rural and urban areas. The recent governments in Sask. has favored oil and gas and not much else which is a shame but who votes them in?
1585 2018-07-11 21:16:14 I cannot understand why buying energy from Russia puts them under Russian control? We buy huge amounts of technology from China. We buy Oil from Iran and other middle eastern countries. We borrow huge amounts of money to cover deficits and we aren't controlled by China. Logic?

1588 2018-07-11 21:15:41 Hey, let's flip the script and have Europe stop buying natural gas and oil from Russia and see who starves out first.
1589 2018-07-11 21:15:40 I may or may not have just took a coconut oil Epsom salt bath and took a sip before I got in

— Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra, Don Quixote de La Mancha
1591 2018-07-11 21:15:33 Guess I missed the nuance and the quote that's not in the blog post amid lines like "oil insiders were able to shape the Generation Energy process to give political cover to the expansion of oil and gas production"
1592 2018-07-11 21:15:30 The moron does not know that there is no one else able to supply oil and gas in that capacity to western Europe. There are no pipelines from the Middle East.
1593 2018-07-11 21:15:28 Consumption methods of cannabis include: 
1. FLOWER - dried cannabis flowers inhaled as smoke or vapor
2. EXTRACTS - cannabis concentrates like hash oil, wax & shatter
3. TOPICALS - cannabis-infused creams, lotions & balms  
4. EDIBLES - any food or beverage infused with cannabis
1594 2018-07-11 21:15:26 #NeutralOpinion @CNN Is Incorrectly Propagating That Germany(#NATO Member) Is Making Friendship With Russia By Buying Oil & Gas Is OK> But #Trump As The President Of USA Cannot Talk With #PUTIN> Again #China #StudentMuslimNobelPrizeWinner Killer Is OK>@Foxnews @Abc @cbs @bbc @ITV
1595 2018-07-11 21:15:05 You know the one time NATO has been called to work together was to help the US. On 911. The German Purchase of oil and gas is something Europe in its entire tea does, including countries that are not in NATO. It is not a government venture. Trump is once again making shit up
1596 2018-07-11 21:14:56 Liberals and Scarborough, What morons you are?
Do you think it makes sense for Germany to complain about Putin and then give him millions of dollars for oil? You Liberals are so ass-backwards! Or you're possessed by demons one or the other? Just make no sense at all!
1597 2018-07-11 21:14:56 #MSNBC #MTPDaily The Damn pipeline is a commercial venture started in 2002. Angela is only unpopular with the right wing nationalists AKA white supremacist! Only 20% of their energy from oil of that 20% 40% is Russian. #StopLying
1598 2018-07-11 21:14:55 Weaning Germany from Russian oil/natural gas and strengthening Western militaries is not an effort to on 'whataboutism'.  You are out of touch with reality.
1599 2018-07-11 21:14:52 Wanna mix water and oil? Kool with me. What flows flows no fucks left in me.
1600 2018-07-11 21:14:38 NOV 4th When Iran sells oil to China, Turkey & Europe? We go to war with Iran? I guess Israel is gonna take the hit for false evidence of WMD this time? The USD is on a fast track to devalue. Todays tough trade talk is panic our allies wont defend the USD$  4 false flag attck
1601 2018-07-11 21:14:34 Ask Angela how many bullets can Russia make with the billions her country is paying for Russian oil? Stupid!
1602 2018-07-11 21:14:33 The check out dude at Chipotle said my natural hair looks soooo healthy today. To which I replied, “Coconut oil and Shea Butter all day!” And to my chagrin he said it right back and added an air snap too! My Entire Day Was Made.

1603 2018-07-11 21:14:25 @realDonaldTrump if Germany is out of line importing energy from russia, what are you doing importing oil from saudi arabia, mexico and venezuela? NOT GOOD FOR US security... ? one country's nationals attacked the USA and you were considering invading another... SAD HYPOCRITE!

1605 2018-07-11 21:14:11 it cannot permeate the outer layer of skinned fruit, especially things like cucumbers that have an oil to isolate the skin further.

we're talking about fruit, in the context of the video. of course a plastic wrapped donut in the car in a summer day will be contaminated
1606 2018-07-11 21:14:10 Long story short, i thought i was dying. My brain couldnt even. My eyes kept closing & my micro sleeping became straight up conscious sleepwalking. I became Tyler Durden... Turns out its bc i havent had ANY mct oil for a week...
1607 2018-07-11 21:14:09 Also!!! Does anyone use coconut oil as eye makeup remover?? I want to try it but my skin is so oily and breaks out so easily so I am nervous about trying it 
1608 2018-07-11 21:14:02 "The phoniest and craziest things in the world cannot be ingested or even fondled - they must be washed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
1609 2018-07-11 21:13:37 Except he just criticized the oil pipe line from Russia to Germany. Germany, our “NATO ally”, has been playing a game of double standards by enriching Russia with oil purchase while asking us to protect them from Russia. Can you clowns actually report the truth?
1610 2018-07-11 21:13:26 200 bucks for an oil change and Chain adjustment on the bike...Damn my pockets
1611 2018-07-11 21:13:19 Need to be able to contact shorty, never know when ima need something . Oil changed, car washed, dick, anything 
1612 2018-07-11 21:13:16 @CNN @ABC @NYTIMES @WASHINGTONPOST @MSNBC @CBSNEWS @FOXNEWS @AP @BBCWorld @Reuters 
Trump on his way to suck up and kiss Putin butt. After he attacked the United States. Trump had the nerve to insult Germany for receiving Putin oil. How naive with the diplomacy of a flea. Crazy!
1613 2018-07-11 21:13:15 @Daniarmstrong88 I’m writing this from the heart. My mum is really poorly with cancer at the moment We will literally try anything 2 get her better. She’s on last treatment she can have!! Everyday is a battle 4 her and 4 us. If cannabis oil  was legal would make it so much better
1614 2018-07-11 21:13:11 Why should American taxpayers waste billions to protect Germany against Russia invasion while Germany spending billions to buy Russian oil? 
Also the building of Nord Stream 2 Pipeline opens ways for Russia to install undersea surveillance equipment in the Baltic Sea.
1615 2018-07-11 21:13:05 Germany gets its oil from Russia because Russia is Germany's closest oil producing nation.  Perhaps that makes to much sense for the Trump Baby.
1616 2018-07-11 21:13:00 Yep football and oil!! Wanna live out here youre gonna be working in the oil field. That’s where the money is at.

Oil is black, like Nohr, but can display multiple colors due to Iridescence, just as how Camilla having all three colors of the weapon triangle, and petals come from flowers and Camellia is a name of a flower which is pronounced similarly to Camilla.
1619 2018-07-11 21:12:50 @INFUSED_Oil_Vin Thanks for following!
1620 2018-07-11 21:12:46 What the heck kind of thinking is this? What does NATO have to do with who Germany buys their oil from? You are NOT a logical thinker, are you?
1621 2018-07-11 21:12:46 When your mates in the west are busy talking  about Artificial Intelligence and  renewable energy  and how to stop buying your so called crude oil! In the next 10 years! 

By then we would drink our oil!
1622 2018-07-11 21:12:38 Take a self care break and vibe back to the fight refreshed. Turn the news off,  get movies you like and popcorn, or have a in house spa day even if it’s just a hot bath with baby oil. Take a break then come back refreshed.
1623 2018-07-11 21:12:32 Wait... You can get oil paintings of Pokémon?
1624 2018-07-11 21:12:09 EU countries do not answer to Trump or USA on their policies. Comparison: USA is still importing oil from Saudi Arabia where the majority of 9/11 terrorists came from. If being constructive is too much to ask then maybe USA should just step out of NATO.
1625 2018-07-11 21:11:45 Yes 100% also the key challenge is will government sustain these policies in the face of increasing oil prices? Our import substitution has always been reactive responses to falling oil prices and foreign reserves
1626 2018-07-11 21:11:45 It’s kinda ironic that he is yelling at Germany for oil deals while he’s a Putin puppet. Remember...anything he says about others can be tied directly to his behavior.
1627 2018-07-11 21:11:28 @CoastPackingCo You wouldn't make a candle out of corn oil so why would anyone even consider anything but #BeefTallowFrenchFries   
Use beef tallow for my golden fries, vegetable shortening you've met your demise.
1628 2018-07-11 21:11:25 @treyradel president DJT did what past president's should have done in the past. Just saying Trump is trump. BTW they complain about Russia but yet they buy their oil and gas from Russia shame on them.  They all should step up and also pay their fair share.
1629 2018-07-11 21:11:25 Count a compliment when certain people can’t stand you. Holy Ghost and Unholy Ghost are like oil and water; they don’t mix.
1630 2018-07-11 21:11:20 So Trump asking them to spend more of their own money on their own defense so the US doesn’t have to is a bad thing? Oh Bernie, you really are a dolt. Germany has also been buying oil from Russia, which Trump clearly pointed out.
1631 2018-07-11 21:11:09 Wouldn’t that mean the US is a captive of Mexico, Venezuela, Canada, Nigeria and the Persian Gulf due to our oil dependence?
1632 2018-07-11 21:11:09 Yes 100% also the key challenge is will government sustain these policies in the face of increasing oil prices? Our import substitution has always been reactive responses to falling oil prices and foreign reserves
1633 2018-07-11 21:11:08 Moi je dirais US oil et Caterpillar <3
1634 2018-07-11 21:11:05 Coconut oil has a Comedogenic Rating of 4 based on a scale of 0-5. Meaning there’s a high chance of it clogging pores and causing breakouts. However, some skin types can tolerate it. Argan oil is non Comedogenic (rated 0) and has amazing benefits as well.
1635 2018-07-11 21:11:02 Couple years back they poured boiling oil on a man's genitals after an attempted rape in our area, we haven't had any cases since
1636 2018-07-11 21:11:00 @Local4News Trump was right to call out Germany We pay billions to protect Germanyfrom Russia and they make a deal with Russia for oil ! Rather than using US oil who protects them. Your coverage sucks
1637 2018-07-11 21:10:49 Meanwhile the price of a barrel of Brent Crude Oil has taken quite a dive and is down 6% at US $74 per barrel #inflation
1638 2018-07-11 21:10:47 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
1639 2018-07-11 21:10:46 Germany is not captive to Russia (for oil) - that's very funny.
1640 2018-07-11 21:10:41 “Paulie did the prep work. He was doing a year for contempt, and he had this wonderful system for doing the garlic. He used a razor, and he used to slice it so thin that it used to liquefy in the pan with just a little oil. It was a very good system...”
1641 2018-07-11 21:10:38 Hopefully he’ll learn from this mistake that will forever be on the internet.
1642 2018-07-11 21:10:22 Snake oil salesman, buy a new house or jet or limo lately. Fraud
1643 2018-07-11 21:10:17 yes, or investment in coal or oil
1644 2018-07-11 21:10:14 Try Clary Sage oil in your bath (have a read about it) or raspberry leaf tea is supposed to be another good one, good luck x
1645 2018-07-11 21:10:12 Home car washing can be harmful to the environment. The pollutants such as soap, oil, tar, and dirt end up in storm sewers that flow into lakes, streams, and rivers.
1646 2018-07-11 21:10:07 夏とかTシャツに油のシミできるよねえ。あれ透けるからほぼ全裸みたいになるよ僕。
1647 2018-07-11 21:10:03 Deflection and chaos. Pretty much his mantra. By that logic, Why is Trump so easy on Russia and Putin? 

If he is sincere, I’d expect him to start supporting renewable energy to help get Germany away from Russian oil. I won’t hold my breath.
1648 2018-07-11 21:09:59 LOL! She's clueless
1649 2018-07-11 21:09:54 Wait and see what happens when Russia ups the price of oil to Germany???
1650 2018-07-11 21:09:51 I wanted England to win, but indeed, all that "It's Coming Home" stuff DID mess with the team's head after all.  Whoever coined that should be boiled in stale chip oil.
1651 2018-07-11 21:09:49 Europe has been buying its  gas and oil from Russia for almost twenty years. So what are you talking about? There haven’t been any new deals with russia. Maybe do a smidge of research before embarrassing yourself on twitter. P.S. research doesn’t mean repeating trump.
1652 2018-07-11 21:09:42 Also maybe Germany could show a little respect to its ally the United States, which has more German immigrants than anywhere else by far, and buy their oil from us and not Russia!
1653 2018-07-11 21:09:41 onto more important matters- is bio oil any good for acne scars?
1654 2018-07-11 21:09:34 But we will keep betraying them by obeying what trump wants . We will be reducing import just to please him. And we will be loosing not just oil but the promised port which could had been our counter to Chinese silk road.
1655 2018-07-11 21:09:29 More free weed I’m making oil and butter 
1656 2018-07-11 21:09:21 CBD OIL IS A LIFE CHANGER FOR STRESS AND ANXIETY. 

Its the only thing that’s helped my physical symptoms of anxiety. This isn’t an ad or anything. If you don’t wanna take medication for anxiety/stress CBD oil is an amazing natural product that has helped me a ton.
1657 2018-07-11 21:09:13 and maybe some lavender oil in the diffuser!
1658 2018-07-11 21:08:51 ratatouille is actually good and easy and pure flavour, or maybe just mandolined and fried in sesame oil with carrots & such
1659 2018-07-11 21:08:49 No, it doesn't get 100% of oil from Russia, of it's total imports of crude, it gets just around/under 40% of it's total from Russia, the rest comes from Norway and other EU member states and small contribution from Opec nations.
1660 2018-07-11 21:08:46 Trump @realDonaldTrump saying “Germany is being held captive by Russia due to purchasing energy and oil from Russia” makes you look like a mobster arm of Putin telling Germany “if you don’t like me or my Putin favoritism, whose your sugar daddy?!!!!” #realdonaldtrump
1661 2018-07-11 21:08:44 I want to bathe in coconut oil 
#coconutoil #softskin
1662 2018-07-11 21:08:41 a bit of whale oil change and Pick it reminds me lunch” “OK, I’ll start screaming at a speedo It's Ops never not a sneaking
1663 2018-07-11 21:08:39 Also money US Is giving Germany for protection is going to Russia for oil/energy. So our US dollars are making Russia rich-not to mention Germany is only paying 2%.  PAY UP EUROPE
1664 2018-07-11 21:08:32 How does Trump's SCOTUS pick feel about protecting whales over oil companies?
1665 2018-07-11 21:08:28 I couldn't possibly but I do get pleasure from dumping attention seekers with the word "aggressive" in their name on the scrap heap that is my blocked list... attention seeking little madam.. she's not an oil painting herself
1666 2018-07-11 21:08:27 ahhh, I see, I must be thinking of refined coconut oil

yeah, like I said it's like, really pretty low-medium low heat i always used, but vegetable oil is also good to have around in general so idk
1667 2018-07-11 21:08:19 Why are US products ending up in NK.  Why is Canadian oil and gas ending up in US. Why are Mexican products ending up in the US. 

Why can't you accept previous presidents descisions.

Why is every European move you make beneficial to Russia
1668 2018-07-11 21:08:14 Not when oil companies get subsidised.  Also there are major corporations,  like Amazon, who pay zero federal taxes.  Minimum wage should be at least 15$ an hour.  It actually should be 21$ an hour of wages reflected the gdp. There can be a lot more redistribution
1669 2018-07-11 21:08:12 Screw Harley Davidson, their overpriced oil leakers.
1670 2018-07-11 21:08:11 Why would you put oil in there? Peanuts produce their own oil. When I make mine, it's just nuts, blending them enough produces all the oil you need.
1671 2018-07-11 21:08:10 I smell like coconut oil and it makes me so happy
1672 2018-07-11 21:08:09 #EnergyEast died because Trudeau killed it by imposing carbon accounting on the pipeline operation, the oil shipped, the upgrading of it AND the project to build it.

In contrast Nigerian and Saudi crudes are not subject to carbon accounting neither are their transportation...
1673 2018-07-11 21:08:06 How nah?... my teams are always going home by the way. But Croatia gave me hope today. And I am a fan of Modric. Have always been.. he is the reason I am supporting Croatia sha

1676 2018-07-11 21:07:43 Its not shawarma its kebab or doner.u dont have money trump has your money.maybe we wont be superpower again but after even 200 300 years we will still manufacturing sth.But when oil finished u will be nothing.even u cant admit yourself u know thats true
1677 2018-07-11 21:07:40 Denmark is doing alright, Venezuela's problem is oil. They think it's theirs.
1678 2018-07-11 21:07:37 That is effing perfect. ROFLMAO Math and the left... oil and water.
1679 2018-07-11 21:07:24 Should voters ban the drilling of new oil wells in SLO County?
1680 2018-07-11 21:07:14 Why The Coming Oil Crunch Will Shock The World #preppers #prepping #survival
1681 2018-07-11 21:07:13 Since Canada supplies a large percentage of US oil imports and we're building a pipeline there I guess that means Canada now controls America! 

I would like to welcome our new colony to the south. You guys better recognize our power or we're gonna cut off the taps!
1682 2018-07-11 21:07:11 I just drove by impd doing the lip-sync challenge by lucas oil and it was so cute my life has been made!!!!!!
1683 2018-07-11 21:07:09 Lol you're part of the worlds problem aswear
1684 2018-07-11 21:07:07 Lmao tea tree oil works wonders when used right
1685 2018-07-11 21:06:58 hmmm ok 

no coconut oil burns at higher temps and smells like crap (there are refined coconut oils u can get for high heat tho) so it should actually be good for a low sautee tbh
1686 2018-07-11 21:06:46 Yes. Divesting from fossil fuels & developing sustainable energy would be much more efficient than entrenched corporate interests trying to make “smarter oil.”
1687 2018-07-11 21:06:29 This govt has policy whiplash syndrome. Stops oil mineral extraction in one part Taranaki sea then allows it in middle Taranaki Maui dolphin sanctuary #policywhiplash #wheresthegreens
1688 2018-07-11 21:06:16 Just make mediterranean style cooking with the basics, but add Slavic elements. Like a mediterranean salad with lots of olive oil and herbs, polenta (important side dish!) and a Croatian fish stew (“brudet”) or stuffed calamari with Balkan spices
1689 2018-07-11 21:06:14 Covered myself head to toe in coconut oil and I cannot wait to get in the shower and exfoliate tomorrow   
1690 2018-07-11 21:06:11 @QBCentral took out the $EGN Calls after oil data. My $VXX September 50s are still healthy and full
1691 2018-07-11 21:05:44 US buys oil from Venezuela. Are you equally happy funding a socialist regime?
1692 2018-07-11 21:05:42 Decided to wander over to Walmart while the oil gets changed in my car, but I have my bag on. Trying really hard not to look like a criminal.
1693 2018-07-11 21:05:41 It's good from Iran to India supplying oil to ous is soo.....  good to ous #iran to #India.
1694 2018-07-11 21:05:35 WHO out there among the working stiffs is SAVING? Name a bunch! You are either a bad liar or totally out of touch! Do you buy gas? Do you pay for healthcare and health insurance? Do you buy heating oil? You must be referring to companies that got the 14% permanent cut, right?
1695 2018-07-11 21:05:35 Yeah forsure. I live in Canada & our pet stores are stoked full with straight CBD oil. People are finally realizing the benefits of it. But yes I 100% agree don’t be giving your dog thc.
1696 2018-07-11 21:05:29 “and today for this low waste snack i have gathered beached seaweed and will be eating this with some olive oil! yum! low waste healthy living is easy and can be cheap guys!”
1697 2018-07-11 21:05:27 You said Germany is captive to Russia because of oil. We are captive to OPEC because of oil. And what is YOU'RE policy #Trump ? To continue that dependency at all cost.
1698 2018-07-11 21:05:22 Weaning Germany from Russian oil/natural gas and strengthening Western militaries is not an effort to break '70 years of unparalleled peace'.
1699 2018-07-11 21:05:09 CRUDE OIL was FALLING dramatically Today, WTI has lost 350 PIPS landing at 69.50 USD per barrel. GOLD was also UNDER PRESSURE, dropped to 1,241 USD.
1700 2018-07-11 21:05:09 Did I need the $26 lip oil from a Clarins? No. But my lips are still supple from when I used it last night.
1701 2018-07-11 21:05:03 England lost and my coconut oil is solid ... summer is officially over 
1702 2018-07-11 21:04:51 Take a smell of tea tree oil and put a warm towel on your head it works wonders 
1703 2018-07-11 21:04:47 Oh and it’s gas not oil
1704 2018-07-11 21:04:45 So why is Germany buying Russian oil to pad pockets of Putin? Why has Germany allowed their military to languish? Why have they agreed to almost pay 2% of GDP to NATO/military upgrade by 2025? You are neither truthful nor neutral.
1705 2018-07-11 21:04:42 Lol India has just cut 10% of Iranian oil imports.India will still buy Iranian oil even during sanctions just like in 2004.Moreover Modi has a visit in Iran next month so everything is ok
1706 2018-07-11 21:04:39 So Donnie fake-scolds Merkel For relying on Russian oil, so there’s your proof that Trump doesn’t have a pro-Russian agenda? Sure, Jan. You Trump not sure are gullible..
1707 2018-07-11 21:04:37 On every match day.. I support a country. Now let me give you a breakdown of the countries I supported... Uruguay, Nigeria, Belgium, Croatia.... now they all left.. leaving Croatia so... who do you think I should support?

1712 2018-07-11 21:03:57 Because a defense treaty is not the same as global trade, troglodyte.  The U.S. buys billions in oil from Saudi Arabia, one of the worst human rights abusers in the world.  #despicablemoron
1713 2018-07-11 21:03:53 Have friends that can say ..hey so you like mecanical work on cars great can you change my oil for free ....
1714 2018-07-11 21:03:46 They could buy there oil and gas from our economy. From America not Russia  that is what trump is saying for you ignorant dems and lefty’s can’t figure that out
1715 2018-07-11 21:03:41 They have had to unmask in the south anyway. Old KKK laws
1716 2018-07-11 21:03:24 Trump is correct. I served in GE. Here is the yet to be discussed pickle Russia has Germany in: all fuel in Germany ( gas, heating oil) cont
1717 2018-07-11 21:03:23 Oh bless! Honestly, it took me forever to find the right combo of products to work for my skin type. Have you tried organic vegan face cleansers? I've also seen people wash their face using coconut oil, and some people who use honey!
1718 2018-07-11 21:03:15 Happy Birthday! Miss you guys  oil check with some barb wire

1720 2018-07-11 21:03:10 @SeabuckWonders Love your video "Watch out for Fake Sea Buckthorn oil!" Inspirational for producers like us to call out the fakes and educate consumers on what true virgin, cold-pressed, raspberry seed oil smells and looks like. Pro tip: it's not clear & odorless
1721 2018-07-11 21:03:01 I was there two weeks ago or so, on the way up to Lassen. The casino reeks of cigarette smoke, but there's an olive oil place that's supposedly pretty cool. Apparently there's a chocolate flavor (?!). Some super-cheap burger place too near there, but I forget the name.
1722 2018-07-11 21:03:00 Croatia, great country. Gorgeous people, great wines, truffles, olive oil, cheese. They also make this wild stew with frogs and eels. They will celebrate hard! Congratulations! 
1723 2018-07-11 21:02:59 We need a massive shift in the economy to renewables, which will provide jobs and taxes for public infrastructure (as will many different industries besides oil and gas).
1724 2018-07-11 21:02:54 U that was supporting Belgium
1725 2018-07-11 21:02:48 CASE YOU FORGOT— # 10 Years Ago TODAY crude oil Peaked at $147./barrel. Recent rally to $75./barrel indicates it may happen again. Are you going to watch.? Contact us, we have possibilities. natgas9@gmail.com
1726 2018-07-11 21:02:46 Those investing billions in oil, instead of education are currently orchestrating their pitfall. 22:02
1727 2018-07-11 21:02:34 Hey Sam!

You forgot to mention that Germany PAYS Russia to supply their natural gas & oil.  Then, Merkle takes billions from US so we can defend Germany from Russia.

Wheres the special counsel?
1728 2018-07-11 21:02:26 The globe likes us when we give them free crap. They don't like Trump b/c the gravy train is over. Economic opportunity and environmental protections? You have to give me real things. You realize the BP oil spill was on Obama's watch along with the EPA screwing up that mine.
1729 2018-07-11 21:02:26 Don’t forget an oil pan

1731 2018-07-11 21:02:04 Yep, I'd rather KSA destroy their desert than US destroy it's Natl Parks. But renewables r the future anyway. 2 bad the value of the $USD relies so heavily on oil trade.
1732 2018-07-11 21:01:51 I’ve never attempted to do an oil change myself & every place is packed with cars with broken ACs damn this weather 
1733 2018-07-11 21:01:51 I swear jack put oil on his body to make him shine bright like a diamond

1735 2018-07-11 21:01:47 I need a lover that’s gonna oil down my body in the summer and bake in the sun with me.
1736 2018-07-11 21:01:42 There are those still hiding behind regulations, 
they strongly believe the oil market will last long enough for them to make more money.

Oil companies to National Parks in Utah.  Allowing the killing of hibernating Wolves and their pups, same treatment to bears.  Disgusting man!

1752 2018-07-11 21:00:07 What are you talking about? He wants Germany less dependent on Russian oil. The right wing parties are saying, “Screw new unelected German Empire.” You’re selling the one world government- no nations no borders- one currency- Eurocentric nonsense.

1757 2018-07-11 20:59:54 It was never about jobs for Americans. It's about delivering for Putin, big oil, and first and foremost the Trump clan.

1762 2018-07-11 20:59:16 If the whole world is downgrading their growth outlook on #basemetals #commodities, #oil is not immune. Yet everyone is long, hmmm.. #Crude -12.633MM, yet rally did not hold. Demand 9.2 and 3.8 was down on the weak. Everyone looking at supply but not demand!! #oott $wti $bno
1763 2018-07-11 20:59:12 With the pressure to keep oil prices down, they have to do something to fill their coffers. And who’s coffers are being filled?  
1764 2018-07-11 20:58:56 how long does it take to do an oil change and alignment i wanna go
1765 2018-07-11 20:58:40 That's because someone stole his horse from oil drum lane.

1768 2018-07-11 20:58:30 No.  I've been watching you for a long time including when you were on CNBC.  You are one of the world's greatest experts on oil.
1769 2018-07-11 20:58:21 We care where Germany gets their oil which Russian has used as a weapon over and over.
1770 2018-07-11 20:58:18 Dam I use coconut oil conditioner and it feels softer
1771 2018-07-11 20:58:05 Oil sees biggest 1-day fall in 2yrs to $73. That should see a 2-3p fall at the pumps. If we had #pumpwatch it would happen!

1777 2018-07-11 20:57:29 - I went to Walmart & asked them how long it’s gon take them to get a oil change & these folks said longer than an hour...No thanks!
1778 2018-07-11 20:57:18 Canada welcomes the return of regular Libyan oil production and exportation under the control of the National Oil Corporation. We encourage national efforts to enhance transparency in the management of natural resources for the benefit of all Libyans.
1779 2018-07-11 20:57:17 Went to get an oil change and got the usual "your car will explode tomorrow if you don't immediately let us do $1300 of repairs" schtick. No thanks, I'll get a second opinion.
1780 2018-07-11 20:57:07 Since I'm allergic to most cooking oils (corn, soy or vegetable, etc) found an @iocolivenews approved olive oil, @STAR_Fine_Foods #ExtraVirginOliveOil, believe it or not, for sale in the U.S. Many of those approved aren't sold or are exorbitantly expensive.
1781 2018-07-11 20:57:07 Twisted Tabloid Alert: Putin must be happy that Trump is pressuring Germany to reconsider making a deal with Russia for oil and gas. Wait! Putin would surely hate losing the deal. Schiff make such idiotic points!
1782 2018-07-11 20:57:03 Sure! Trump just blasted NATO nations who buy Oil / Gas from Russia.pouring trillions into Putin’s pockets and his military! So, who’s truly in bed with Russia? Hmmm?
1783 2018-07-11 20:56:58 čevapi is great finger food. otherwise croatian food is simple: simple fish eg sardines, octopus, olive oil, sheep cheese, white wine...

1785 2018-07-11 20:56:51 i’ve been using lavender essential oil in place of perfume for the last two weeks and it’s actually made me calmer
1786 2018-07-11 20:56:34 Going back in time! What's next? the strap, outhouse, slate tablets, chauk, or castor oil for all students.
1787 2018-07-11 20:56:32 Eat sand or bacon we feed y'all but we don't need your oil. We should stop sending the grain ships to the middle East.
1788 2018-07-11 20:56:30 Heck, if Russia turns off its oil spigot Germany would be in deep .  They are beholden to Putin now. In essence, they are his biatch. They better wake up and buy oil from the US the country that protects them  from Russia.
1789 2018-07-11 20:56:14 I already needa new oil change smh
1790 2018-07-11 20:56:11 My money is on these guys for Sunday. Till then, my money is on Meteo and ATG. Let me burn some midnight oil
1791 2018-07-11 20:56:01 Another ding bat who tries to be significant by ranting stupidities about nothing that is truthful. Keep paying Germany with our tax $ for NATO so we can protect them from Russia while they buy oil from Russia. Our Pres. Is not stupid he called them out correctly. America first.
1792 2018-07-11 20:55:56 You were very keen to use these countries in your decimation of Iraq so that it didnt appear to be all US misdirected effort and your fault. Now you want to disown them? Is the protection of oil not a threat to America any more?
1793 2018-07-11 20:55:50 im bout to learn how to change my oil lmao
1794 2018-07-11 20:55:46 WAIT until Putin wants something of Germany and cuts off their gas and oil in the middle of the winter. Didnt they do this to Ukraine?
1795 2018-07-11 20:55:46 To protect themselves from this anti-democratic poison, Merkel and the allies need to sanction the American oligarchs--casino bosses, hedge fund managers, oil executives-- propping up the Trump regime by prohibiting business activities and entrance into their countries.
1796 2018-07-11 20:55:38 He scolded NATO for taking Russian oil while we defend them from Russia.  What part of that does Putin like?   Geez....the faux outrage is drama queen level
1797 2018-07-11 20:55:24 the money is obvious its big US oil. Saudis are an adjunct asshole sheep fucking goofs king of shit hill.

1801 2018-07-11 20:54:43 How do you get that job of rubbing oil on women asses? Asking for a friend.
1802 2018-07-11 20:54:37 I want to be present for this , I could help hold the bowl of oil. Will it be at the shrine?

1804 2018-07-11 20:54:34 Soon oil won't be obsolete, it'll be an abomination to alter the tectonic plate in order to draw oil.

-The loss is gonna be wild.
1805 2018-07-11 20:54:23 Trump tweeted recently about talking to Saudis about the oil price being too high a few days ago. Maybe the big funds saw that as relevant? Either way... it is news I suppose.
1806 2018-07-11 20:54:22 Mail them to me next time, I got jaws of life for hands right now from all the oil filters I’ve removed this week.
1807 2018-07-11 20:54:19 By trying to prevent an oil pipeline between Russia and Germany?
1808 2018-07-11 20:54:15 The illegitimate jackass of a PRESIDENT wants,GERMANY to buy its,oil and gas from SAUDI ARABIA, to help SAUDI ARABIA pay for the $250 MILLION DOLLARS worth of DEFENSE ARMS and DEFENSE WEAPONS SYSTEMS it purchased from DEFENSE CORPORATIONS in the UNITED STATES, and buy doing so,
1809 2018-07-11 20:54:01 GERMANY IS A MESS!! A Russian oil pipeline is being installed into Germany!! Bypassing Poland n Ukraine??? Where is there alliance????

1811 2018-07-11 20:53:48 , add some extra virgin olive oil over the cucumbers.
1812 2018-07-11 20:53:37 Whale oil lamps? Rush lights?
1813 2018-07-11 20:53:29 Weaning Germany from Russian oil/natural gas and strengthening Western militaries is not a sign Trump is more loyal to Putin.  You are out of touch with reality.
1814 2018-07-11 20:53:28 Nope, it’ll hurt the US military complex. Let’s move out and use that money not for oil wars or forcing democracy onto the highest bidder, but for US projects that help the middle class. My bet: Not Trumps intent. He wants to make money for him amd the other rich crooks
1815 2018-07-11 20:53:24 Hey @HeyFranHey what’s the name of the sunscreen/tan oil you told us about last year on @FriendZonePod
1816 2018-07-11 20:53:16 The man that changes my oil wanna be my man so bad.

We are slowly loosing our culture in Zambia, I just saw a guy washing his hands after eating vitumbuwa instead of rubbing the oil on his head. U can't imagine the way i was hurt
1819 2018-07-11 20:52:37 Gotta get a oil change, tires serviced & pick up my uniforms tomorrow & I bought my plane tickets & then accidentally made an overseas phone call so guess I’m starving til payday cause a bitch is BROKE
1820 2018-07-11 20:52:18 Another home run analysis. Great call on Oil, banked me some nice winners.
1821 2018-07-11 20:52:16 Yeah. Squeeze them to do what?  We lost all the squeeze power we had.  Whatever, that amount of oil is out of our supply now.  You put faith in guy who went bankrupt 5 times to fix our economy.

1823 2018-07-11 20:52:05 To everyone who says that Scotland is too poor, too wee and too stupid to be an independent country; Croatia has a population of 4.1m, has been independent for just 23 years, has oil and gas reserves, and is in the World Cup Final!
1824 2018-07-11 20:51:46 PREPARE THE BOILING OIL!
1825 2018-07-11 20:51:28 Well the richest person probably isnt a mentor. And also probably sits on generational wealth. They dont have to learn or practice. Their money is working/profiting forever.. oil, pharmacy, banking, insurance.
1826 2018-07-11 20:51:21 It’s about protecting your trade routes and the two allies that you defend to a fault, Israel and Saudi....also oil related!
1827 2018-07-11 20:51:17 This is football my friend and don't forget what Happened at Euro Cup 2016!
1828 2018-07-11 20:51:11 While Germany buys Billions in oil from Putin!!!!  What a joke NATO is; AMERICAN TAXPAYERS WANT THEIR BILLIONS IN DEFENSE SPENDING FOR EUROPE BACK!!!
1829 2018-07-11 20:51:08 they are nice as weapons dealers go and as it's #RAF100 the freedom bombs are good at finding oil,opium,forests whatever they might need. "royal" air force is a hint but some people .........

1833 2018-07-11 20:50:47 Poor schifforbrains- you can’t see that hypocrisy in Germany asking for money to defend it from Russia but than paying Russia billions for oil. Are you really that ignorant?
1834 2018-07-11 20:50:35 When over 50% of Germany's gas and oil comes from Russia while nearly 60% of Russia's GDP is exports, mostly going to NATO countries in Europe. A military war would be mutually assured economical suicide. I don't think they're as much of a threat as NATO members make out.

1836 2018-07-11 20:50:32 Iran already sells its oil to China in #yuan, rather than US dollars, meaning that the entire #UScontrolled financial system is completely circumvented for the countries' bilateral trade, and therefore outside the control of US-imposed financial sanction..RT
1837 2018-07-11 20:50:30 Russia has gold and oil that is why every one have eyes on the Russia.
1838 2018-07-11 20:50:30 My prognostication is that you'll promise #Putin to lift the sanctions and start buying our oil from him as well. You're a danger to our National Security and the GOP Congress is recognizing that, as well as members of your own cabinet #Trump . #TrumpNATO

1844 2018-07-11 20:49:47 Oil dey your head
1845 2018-07-11 20:49:39 Do you understand how much oil it takes to go green?
1846 2018-07-11 20:49:38 Twice the carbon per barrel than any other oil in the world. Sanctimonious pieces os shit
1847 2018-07-11 20:49:32 U want Germany to get oil from us... Do you want it to get more volumes from us that Russia or more $$$s worth from us than Russia? Lol.
1848 2018-07-11 20:49:29 And who does the US pay for its oil?
1849 2018-07-11 20:49:22 bomba nabili kong oil pastel ih
1850 2018-07-11 20:49:19 Nope it’s way easier to clean the cheap ones. An oil based candle gets on your expensive showgirl costume or on the stage and you’ve ruined your costume & made the stage dangerous for the other performers.

1857 2018-07-11 20:48:47 Wow, don’t hurt yourself contorting the facts that much to get a negative spin. No political party could’ve helped the drop in oil prices and you know that. Take a look at Saskatchewan right now.

1863 2018-07-11 20:48:19 Seems to me @realDonaldTrump is trying to get Europe to NOT BUY Russian oil.  If Trump is successful at this “poof” there goes Putin’s “profits”.  How is that mistaken for Trump helping Putin?  That seems to be the opposite of what you state.
1864 2018-07-11 20:48:14 sustainable lifestyle changes, even small ones, DO make a difference. yes, not everyone is privileged enough to make changes. but if every able person eliminated single use plastics, palm oil products, etc. and put their money into what they support, we can create a movement.

Hello Chris Enjoyed the evening at Marlborough.  I have downloaded 2 apps to use when shopping to detect palm oil ingredients.

1871 2018-07-11 20:47:54 Germany can’t afford 2%...too busy buying oil and gas from crook ruskie oligarchs.......
1872 2018-07-11 20:47:52 Avocado oil and Himalayan salt kettle chips are AMAZING
1873 2018-07-11 20:47:44 I am not a Trump fan, but he hits home on occasion. Canada’s Defence spending is paltry because we rely on U.S.   We buy oil from Venezuela and Saudi Arabia but don’t use our own?  Europe  fears Russia, but buys gas from them.  Leadership?  What is that?
1874 2018-07-11 20:47:34 Then if what you say is true, 100% of Germany’s oil comes from Russia. Ger. didn’t get help from any other NATO allies, including us, but instead has this resource from a country in which NATO was formed to protect against. Russia now has all the power.
1875 2018-07-11 20:47:16 They powerwashed the complex today. They were meant to start at 9 AM, but apparently they meant 9 AM PST as they didn't start til nearly noon EST. My poor anxious girl's CBD oil didn't make a dent in the barking/pacing/freaking. Barked so much she had an accident. My poor baby 
1876 2018-07-11 20:47:13 I put this pure tea tree oil on my face that my sister got and it felt like I had acid thrown on my face  I ain’t know that shit burn like that
1877 2018-07-11 20:47:12 Trump is a master at marketing, a charlatan,  a snake oil salesman and a propagandist.  Sound like anyone else in history

England ah teef out all the gold and oil thats why dem cyan't win nutin. Not even cricket 
1880 2018-07-11 20:46:38 That's incorrect. It's also based on income. You clearly have the internet. Use it. 

We didn't receive a tax break. Well we did but it came out to be about 2 dollars a month. Yeah, so great. 

And with groceries costing more, oil, gas, medical insurance etc. All gone.
1881 2018-07-11 20:46:37 Yes sir! Half my pension? No way! Shes stuck with me.
1882 2018-07-11 20:46:32 Great question! All travelers must comply with Federal law on transporting marijuana and cannabis infused products, such as CBD oil, on board a flight. Our officers are required to notify law enforcement officers if they discover these products while screening your property.
1883 2018-07-11 20:46:18 Look. We buy Russian oil. Does this mean we're United with Russia? No. Same thing.
1884 2018-07-11 20:46:07 Same. $IQ 

Thought that large oil draw would make for a great day
1885 2018-07-11 20:46:02 Check your Engine oil this Sunday.

1890 2018-07-11 20:45:40 On a real note though, are there really guys who out here who can’t change oil, change a tire or cut grass or lift shit? Maybe it’s how I was raised but I would just be like shorty done even worry about It got you.
1891 2018-07-11 20:45:39 The human mind of Christian religion fervently opposes the King. Your carnal mind will be incinerated by the oil of favor and the wine of love or you will die and go to hell.
1892 2018-07-11 20:45:38 Yes! It is a very thick oil so it sucks washing it off but it helps too, eyelashes and brows as well

1896 2018-07-11 20:45:01 They buy and sell oil with the "almighty" US dollar...
1897 2018-07-11 20:44:57 @falklands_utd Are thousands of liters of oil heated to throw at the Croats?

-Small toys to start
-Use them while watching porn that makes you want to bottom 
-Masturbate while you’re doing it 
-Use good lube like ID or Gun Oil
-Keep using your toys semi-regularly till you’ve become accustomed
1903 2018-07-11 20:44:25 A friend of mine growing up had 5 brothers and one bathroom. Their mom had a urinal installed in the garage.  2 years later she had another one put in the barn. 
1904 2018-07-11 20:44:20 WW1 - US participation 2½ years after start of war.
WW2 - Did not give a F*** for Europe for 2 years, then Pearl Harbor woke US up.
Korea - A war kept alive and Lost by US.
Vietnam - Total loss for US
Kuwait - Loss of enormous amount of oil rescources. US loose.
1905 2018-07-11 20:44:17 Read the piece. Copper is an important industrial metal.  Crashing copper prices suggest weak demand. They call copper the metal with a PHD in economics. Copper is used in just about everything from copper wiring in homes to cell phones.  Oil fell $4 today too.
1906 2018-07-11 20:44:13 Oil 101--If "significant" cuts are made in global production, price goes up; if "significant" increases are made in global production, price goes down; all the day-to-day volatility is just noise.

1908 2018-07-11 20:43:56 We have deserts, plains, forests, coastal areas. Very diverse. Texans brag about how big it is, but I lived in Alaska for awhile & it’s over twice the size of Texas.
We have massive amounts of oil & gas, but also lots of wind & solar power. Over 1000 people move here every day.
1909 2018-07-11 20:43:55 I took economics in college.  I am correct & haven't listed EVERYTHING Trump has done!  Opening up oil & coal & funding Military - those industries all need tools, supplies & machinery that other businesses make & sell= JOBS! 

People make more $$ can spend more = ECONOMIC BOOM!
1910 2018-07-11 20:43:51 Oil, spark plugs and filter I can do, but I won’t touch brakes. Spark plugs are a nightmare. I think I could do with a mechanics course.

1915 2018-07-11 20:43:22 Here we are paying 70% of their fucking defense, and Germany alone is buying 70 Billion in oil from Russia.
1916 2018-07-11 20:43:22 Now isn't that mad? Proof that bees don't like to clean their ears! No only messin'. Perhaps too much of the oil was use?, I am growing a pot of actual lemon grass to see if that makes a difference. I wasn't as lucky as @HRHgearoid with lures this year I need a branch of his tree
1917 2018-07-11 20:43:11 You're deliberately taking him out of context. He meant oil & natural gas. Being the idiotic MMGW believers that Germany is, they have decimated their own fossil fuel energy sector.

This current administration doesn’t care about you -only God, their money, and making sure you get nothing in return
1929 2018-07-11 20:42:08 Love and hate all the oil used during a massage
1930 2018-07-11 20:42:08 I actually went on a mechanics evening course - and all I can remember is how to do the oil, coolant, check the chain and tyre pressure  well done on your evening’s achievements !

1933 2018-07-11 20:41:21 One thing dear Arabs dont understand u r not in any country's import list.Because u dont manufacture anything.when oil finished u r finished.u r just lazy kinglover men.
1934 2018-07-11 20:41:19 Where they import oil from and they're defense spending is not related. 

Especially when we get more from Russia than Germany does. 

Pot and kettle.
1935 2018-07-11 20:41:12 Now 'they' are really coming home!!!
1936 2018-07-11 20:41:08 What good are We if we continue to pay Saudi Arabia billions of dollars for oil when those scoundrels blew up the Twin Towers?  PS: Obama tracked and killed BinLaden.....you would have kissed him !
1937 2018-07-11 20:41:02 I really love all the players though - and I would totally rub their legs with baby oil if they wished
1938 2018-07-11 20:41:00 So we should unpack that and understand the consequences.
All this conscious influencing should be about reversing the momentum of unconscious bias to relevel the playing field.

And yes done right should result in female oil rig workers and male primary school teachers

1940 2018-07-11 20:40:52 One question I've had re straw bans is if fewer straws are being made do people think the oil used to make them will stay in the ground? or is it just going to be made into something else plastic?
1941 2018-07-11 20:40:42 Holy shit I kid you not the moment I started taking fish oil, my bloating went down a lot and I can definitely see less fat accumulation on my belly ! No wonder people say fish oil is liquid gold

Is this fool and imbecile to stupid to not realize his question to Soderbergh was so stupid it’s embarrassing and idiotically insane
1948 2018-07-11 20:39:59 I say that I agree 100% that Venezuela is a great example of how foolish it was to build an economy and welfare state on producing unlimited quantities of their expensive and shitty oil, and continue from there maliciously assuming that they want to talk oil geopolitics.

1957 2018-07-11 20:39:39 I have also heard that oil companies have refused to build new refineries in Venezuela so they have a harder time getting their crude refined and oil extracted in that region requires a more expensive process already

2009 2018-07-11 20:33:51 I suppose you could toss Mineral Oil into the mix.  Also comparing say 11 billion via a pipeline per year from Russia to Germany (in a country I can drive across in 8 hours) to US consumption is inane.   Sit down and spin.
2010 2018-07-11 20:33:33 Where did I lie? Since Jan. 1 2018, according to data you yourself provided, we received 38.6 million barrels of oil from Russia. At around $60 a barrel (a conservative estimate for pricing during this year), that's about $2.3 billion worth of oil from them.

2022 2018-07-11 20:31:01 Best get me oil can topped up ready devil's Bridge for bacon I reckon lol
2023 2018-07-11 20:30:51 Therefore unable to pay for oil imports?
2024 2018-07-11 20:30:51 Quick question: how can he be Putin’s puppet and then call Germany out for taking Russia’s oil? Which one is it?
2025 2018-07-11 20:30:51 Iran - Sanandaj
Angry youths in the city of Sanandaj beat and destroyed two police cars. The mullahs' regime protested against the non-accountability of the Revolutionary Guard, which smuggled oil and resulted in a collision of the fuel truck of the guard with
2026 2018-07-11 20:30:48 Germany is a leach country. Buying their oil from Russia but failing to pay their fair share. Trump is so right to call them out.
2027 2018-07-11 20:30:46 All the Gulf States except Qatar are involved. We've gone to war for them twice (1991 and 2003). They've got oil and we've got weaponry. A match made in hell.
2028 2018-07-11 20:30:44 i asked my doctors for their opinions on cbd oil and whether they'd have concerns about me trying it and they both messaged me back about it but now i've just missed a call from the hospital and i'm wondering what's happening now lmfao

2032 2018-07-11 20:30:11 WRONG on all points!  No, Obama did NOT pull us out, he made it worse!  Trump saved our economy & created jobs with tax reform PLUS cancelling Obama's job-killing regulations, brought back oil & coal industries, & corporations came back from overseas bc of Trump's tax reform.
2033 2018-07-11 20:30:04 Ooooh yes to both of these. Also, the oil pipeline bomb scenario in The World is Not Enough

2035 2018-07-11 20:29:55 Allies would be countries that came to our aid after 9/11, joined with us to bomb Syria, respect democracy, and don’t meddle with our elections.   Hostile countries (or dictators) attack our democracy, undermine our “efforts” in Syria, sell oil to NK...stuff like that.
2036 2018-07-11 20:29:32 I cried when the oil change person asked how my day was going. I don’t even have a kid. I wish I had that fucking graham cracker.
2037 2018-07-11 20:29:30 ain’t nothing like a new oil change
2038 2018-07-11 20:29:24 This is so bad but it's funny

How many babies does it take to make a bottle of baby oil?
It depends on how hard you squeeze them
2039 2018-07-11 20:29:21 Russia exports 22 billion to Germany total. We import 20 billion in oil alone are you telling me the entire 22 billion sent to Germany is oil? 

Sit down.
2040 2018-07-11 20:29:15 I might try the CBD oil. That sounds less intense  then I can probably get my anxiety under control enough to handle big boi stuff
2041 2018-07-11 20:29:12 The bean sprouts clear oil version is really good! *I* think it’s better but obviously I’m biased. 
2042 2018-07-11 20:29:07 they've been calling that land iraq for the past while but before the soldiers of islam conquered and occupied it the name of that region was referred to as babylon and that is where the jewish people are said to originate..... don't fool yourself, it has nothing to do with oil
2043 2018-07-11 20:28:50 @AndrewScheer the worst leader of the opposition in a century Does this man know just how inadequate he is. If anything it was the failure of his Gov &Party to place is sound financial footing in period 2006/2015 no new oil dev. for Alberta no pipeline to tide water #failure

2048 2018-07-11 20:28:13 Would the gold/oil ratio play a roll in this?
2049 2018-07-11 20:28:04 David @SmithInAmerica noted that @realDonaldTrump calling out Merkel over Germany's oil and gas deal with Russia seemed to be a move out of the Russian handbook
2050 2018-07-11 20:28:00 Just vape CBD oil or take it then it has no psychoactive effect
2051 2018-07-11 20:27:59 a pipeline is just a massive straw for corps to suck down oil
2052 2018-07-11 20:27:51 Even if my Hair Oil doesn’t go far I am still proud of myself for stepping out on faith because I have definitely gone out of my comfort zone these past 3 months!

2054 2018-07-11 20:27:44 HEY DONLD, tell everyone WHAT THIS IS REALLY ABOUT. YOU sold out to Russia. Russia OWNS YOU. This isn’t about gas or oil or Germany or NATO. This is SO YOU can cozy up to Putin and say “ Well, Germany does”, but they don’t. “ Germany loves AMERICA, YOU DON’T. YOU ARE THE TRADER.

2061 2018-07-11 20:26:48 TRumptards need to look in the mirror and realize they’ve been duped by a Snake Oil Salesman. The Red President LIES is a LIAR. Benedict Donald preach hatred and racism and they bought it lock stock and barrel.

crap for them
Europe is screwing us for
our help to protect them
Charging us big tariffs or not
accepting our products
And paying Putin for oil
instead of accepting our gas...
2067 2018-07-11 20:26:37 I used a mixture of olive oil and malt vinegar, once.  Fell asleep in the garden... I was wrapped up clingfilm for a fortnight 
2068 2018-07-11 20:26:36 You ain’t said shit slick to a can of oil.
2069 2018-07-11 20:26:35 This clarins lip oil is everything  @arnellarmon put me on and there’s no going back.
2070 2018-07-11 20:26:31 NATO wants America funding it's defense against the Russian horde, so that they can save their money to buy Russian oil.  smh
2071 2018-07-11 20:26:31 Peppermint oil helps with acid reflux!
2072 2018-07-11 20:26:15 No we can bring it back oil don’t worry you just have to believe (hopefully)
2073 2018-07-11 20:26:13 It's not even oil. It's gas.
2074 2018-07-11 20:26:07 CBD oil is awesome. Weed nowadays is higher THC content than it used to be I think
2075 2018-07-11 20:26:04 it’s loosening up a bit now. i’ve been adding some oil to my scalp. feels amazing.
2076 2018-07-11 20:26:03 Yes we found oil lamps and couple painted walls. Funny thing couple of old shepherds still kept sheep near the site. We were talking to them and they wanted to show us some coins. Bought a couple from them and a bronze nail. Easier then digging for them
2077 2018-07-11 20:26:02 Today my mom’s posts shared on Facebook include: a joke list about “signs you’re on menopause”, Dave Grohl quote about Voice and Idol shows ruining next gen of musicians, joke about POPEYE’s chicken and OLIVE oil, broken link for missing person from another state. #momsfacebook
2078 2018-07-11 20:25:57 Dont know but Germany will become the first country to be oil, gas and nuclear power free. I believe by 2020 something! Pretty awesome that they are leading the charge.
2079 2018-07-11 20:25:55 Oil and Gas make up 48% of Russian exports.  They're essentially a giant Gas Station and what they send our way is peanuts compared to OECD and non OECD states including Western Europe and Asia.  What's this "sit down" shit.  I know more about this than you do.
2080 2018-07-11 20:25:46 Bush did a lot to recover the economy after 9/11 but Obama shot it all to hell w/ job killing regulations & killing the coal & oil industries. Obamacare made FT jobs only 29 hrs/wk making ppl work 2 jobs. Employers went out of business & the big corps left USA.  You're in denial!

2083 2018-07-11 20:25:15 It is called Dormant oil I believe but I am not sure. Consult with a good teee-shrub care provider he or she will know what to spray when. I had brown spots and fungus, this keeps it away.
2084 2018-07-11 20:24:55 Trump is right, doing a pipeline with Russia? What has happened to Germany. England of all people knows he can turn off oil if you piss off

American cheese is often labelled "edible oil product".

2089 2018-07-11 20:24:20 Except I'm living off the grid so I just fill oil drums with coal and light it on fire when I want to bathe, prepare a fresh meal, or read a book, none of which I ever want to do because I'm a troglodyte.
2090 2018-07-11 20:24:10 A white guy just told me I look like I smell like coconut oil and cocoa butter and I literally use neither.

Happy times. 
2095 2018-07-11 20:23:27 Wait ! So is " it " coming home or not?
2096 2018-07-11 20:23:22 i dont think this is unreasonable. God forbid we ever go to war with Russia but if it happens, how can we expect Germany to be a fighting force if 70% of their oil/natural gas is immediately cut off?
2097 2018-07-11 20:22:58 Its not coming home #ENG is out
2098 2018-07-11 20:22:54 @LaynesCF What kind of oil do you guys use?  It might be on your website, but after a little digging it was not easy to find.
2099 2018-07-11 20:22:52 I have never like the man. He reminds me of a slimy snake oil salesman.
2100 2018-07-11 20:22:46 Holy crap that's insane! Seems like a very rapid taper, likely to be ineffective. Also, CBD oil is hella expensive, and did nothing for me

2102 2018-07-11 20:22:37 We know that's his point. It was a blatant attempt at extortion and hypercritical since we import $20 billion in Russian oil. 

Sit down.
2103 2018-07-11 20:22:34 The COT was so skewed bulls are trapped, any panic should hopefully send this crashing
2104 2018-07-11 20:22:30 A lot of times I see that black women are only praised online when they are in a swimsuit covered in body oil but in real life our natural features and traits ignored just to be recognized on women of another race.
2105 2018-07-11 20:22:30 Those robots will be crying for us to oil their joints when they take over the world, but we won't.  We'll stay in our cells.
2106 2018-07-11 20:22:25 When exactly did the US -Germany complete oil exports?
2107 2018-07-11 20:22:15 CBD oil isnt and it's for pain relief.
2108 2018-07-11 20:22:11 9-22
2109 2018-07-11 20:22:11 Trump's right. Y shld usa carry Germany, etc financially? They r strengthening russia by buying their oil. Russia is reason NATO was even started. Backwards. U dont make an enemy stronger by trading & buying from them. Goes 4 muslims 2. Y buy their oil & make them richer?
2110 2018-07-11 20:22:08 This is the lamest bull shit of the day. Frats and SCOTUS...oil and water.
2111 2018-07-11 20:21:46 What is it?
2112 2018-07-11 20:21:42 No.  Trump breaks up NATO.  Putin still sells oil.  Where else are they going to get oil and gas from?
2113 2018-07-11 20:21:39 Funny how so many were sure the day oil drops airlines would fly. Nope. 
$JETS $AAL $DAL $JBLU
2114 2018-07-11 20:21:30 Yes!!!!! Palm oil stew
2115 2018-07-11 20:21:30 If Germany is essential to peace in the world, and yet doubles its purchase of oil and gas from Russia, yet insists they need us to protect them from Russia, isn't that a problem? Trump was right to call them out on their duplicity.
2116 2018-07-11 20:21:28 Oil also has a political price-tag. Pluss Libya coming back. And Iran can sell to China.
2117 2018-07-11 20:21:26 When you eat Greek feta at home drizzle olive oil and oregano all over it. #greekfood 
2118 2018-07-11 20:21:08 First of all the moment anybody say coconut oil and face in the same sentence .... automatically I discredit ... real certified estheticians and skincare specialist feel me
2119 2018-07-11 20:20:55 OMG, I did not know about "7/10." Apparently the oil form of America's favorite plant medicine has its own holiday. (It spells "oil" upside down and backwards.) What next, a special holiday for the cookies?
2120 2018-07-11 20:20:51 Home in this rain, got my oil diffuser puffing love scents, smart lights set to pink sunset 
2121 2018-07-11 20:20:49 if cnbc/msnbc says the economy is growing again I think the universe may just send a black hole our way - there is obviously something shifting in these market with the manner copper just preceded todays oil move but still expecting another massive price jump in oil b4
2122 2018-07-11 20:20:47 and he did. HOW DARE HE WAIT TO BE ASKED FOR HELP WHEN HE'S MERELY TRYING TO EXPLORE SPACE, CHANGE GLOBAL TRAVEL, AND END OIL DEPENDENCY! wait, he still helped. what's the issue again?
2123 2018-07-11 20:20:37 Use any hair oil like olive oil or coconut oil on damp hair. Applying oil or product on damp hair absorbs better.
2124 2018-07-11 20:20:36 I would have a hard enough time doing your job, that’s even worse. I don’t like the way oil and copper are trading.
2125 2018-07-11 20:20:33 is this why my sauté oil always tilts to one corner of the pan
2126 2018-07-11 20:20:29 Germany doesn’t depend on Russian has, in fact that makes up less than 10% of their energy needs. Germany is boosting their green energy production and will be totally independent in a few years.
Trump just wants German money and to sell his own oil but Merkel doesn’t trust him.
2127 2018-07-11 20:20:24 I love showering, shaving and then putting coconut oil all over so I’m just one soft human
2128 2018-07-11 20:20:09 The Matt nuln oil stains too much of the surface and is very Matt, the gloss is a little too runny for me, together they give a nice sheen, settles well in the recesses and doesn’t stain the flat as much. Give it a try for yourself.
2129 2018-07-11 20:20:05 I'm kinda hurting for some cash with an oil change and some bills coming up~ If I opened up a YCH, would it be an opportune time for yall~?

2138 2018-07-11 20:18:53 Comparing Notch and Musk is unfair. Notch didn't make his money by being a snake oil salesman. Musk is one of the biggest frauds in the recent history, since Bernie Madoff.

2151 2018-07-11 20:17:21 I'd imagine the pressure is coming down pretty hard to keep oil down before the midterms at least.
2152 2018-07-11 20:17:17 Hopefully the oil doesn’t fall too much. This recent surge was nice
2153 2018-07-11 20:17:08 The big story today - sharp drop in Crude oil prices

2155 2018-07-11 20:16:59 What is wrong with you ??

If Germany doesnt have the resources in energy for their population they need to get it from somewhere ....we need oil why are we getting it from the Middle East ??
2156 2018-07-11 20:16:54 By telling Germany they should NOT give Russia money for oil???? What???
2157 2018-07-11 20:16:49 With regards to Molyneux, JBP, Cerno, etc.: at least the snake oil salesman of old used to sell you opium or cocaine in their cure-alls.

2162 2018-07-11 20:16:24 When a country can threaten your oil supply at any given time, they can control your decisions.  But you only repeat talking points, no longer think for yourself.
2163 2018-07-11 20:16:14 I knew someone who had very bad anxiety, had a CBD vape & if they felt anxious, they’d smoke it and it helped them calm down. Do you use an oil for you knees or is it in a lotion/cream? I tried actual oil. I didn’t know if there’s a difference
2164 2018-07-11 20:15:56 Not all the way true, Trump is disrupting NATO (Germany) because of their relationship of being in cahoots with Russia, which has cause horrific problems in this country (with traitorous Americans in cahoots with them), however, oil backers are using it to their benefit, not US.
2165 2018-07-11 20:15:46 What lie? @Tzeporah appointment to an oil & gas panel is an insult to Albertans. It was a huge mistake. Stating that is not a lie by @jkenney It’s an opinion.
2166 2018-07-11 20:15:44 Check your Transmission oil this weekend.
2167 2018-07-11 20:15:44 Well, as always it is not that easy. Europe (not only Germany) needs some of the oil. Can probably get it somewhere else, like Saudi or Iran, but that raises other problems. There are certain products, not so much the energy, which are based on oil.
2168 2018-07-11 20:15:42 Crikey, what was it Dave? Looks like an oil tanker has spring a leak!
2169 2018-07-11 20:15:40 Dad had a "Cut government to cure inflation!" bumper sticker in our garage in Houston.
By the time Reagan left office, dad was throwing GOP Christmas cards in the fireplace to watch them burn.
He was a Navy man and oil executive. Hardly a softy. But he knew Reaganomics was bunk.
2170 2018-07-11 20:15:29 Yes boiled with mash potatoes and olive oil!
2171 2018-07-11 20:15:24 You know we buy oil from Nations that support terrorism right?
2172 2018-07-11 20:15:18 I need a mf oil change but I hate waiting :(
2173 2018-07-11 20:15:12 Le risposte-politichese di Stoltenbergal @POTUS... ma @realDonaldTrump va come un bulldozer e livella tutti. 
Ha fatto benissimo a 'denudare' l'ipocrita Merkel (non se l'aspettava)+i 'deutsche' trattati per gas/oil con la Russia. Giochini squallidi contro di noi, soprattutto.

2178 2018-07-11 20:14:50 It’s bad when you’re at home and go to eat something and It just doesn’t taste right. Tastes like it’s missing something. Then you remember you forgot the oil base. 
2179 2018-07-11 20:14:48 I'm the one receiving

2181 2018-07-11 20:14:35 I have oil again lmfaooo oh man goddamn
2182 2018-07-11 20:14:32 of course then do.  Like I said net exports to Asia and elsewhere have tripled.  If the Germans want Nordstream2 to continue their addiction to "cheap" Russian oil then kindly don't accuse us of trying to undermine NATO when the Germans are the ones funding Russia's coffers.
2183 2018-07-11 20:14:18 @NearMeNotifica1 thanks for following me, Hemp Oil. Animal health. Complete wellness. Nice to connect.
2184 2018-07-11 20:14:13 Now that is one fugly daily profile on OIL.  Price running away from value as we speak.
2185 2018-07-11 20:14:08 Words can't express frustration of expecting to pay $ for a service & then be told 2x over 2 diff days that it can't happen for xyz reasons. I would invest $10K in an "oil change disruptor" startup THIS AFTERNOON. #femaletax

2193 2018-07-11 20:13:12 #Inrbonds #Investorsareidiots @arjunparthasara U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that Washington would consider requests from some countries to be exempt from #sanction due to go into effect in November to prevent #Iran from exporting oil.
2194 2018-07-11 20:13:04 Yeah I'm still wondering what's up with that since we have plenty of oil and the refineries are fine.
2195 2018-07-11 20:13:01 Did you use a piece of plastic today? See, now, that's exactly why we need oil. Any questions?  #ClimateChange #GlobalWarming
2196 2018-07-11 20:12:58 using coconut oil instead of shaving cream is way better
2197 2018-07-11 20:12:40 Where do we get our oil from? Do they control us?
2198 2018-07-11 20:12:34 Spike in Oil price won’t be sufficient as mkt knows that is fickle. Ensure no policy flip flop, take import substitution seriously, increase source of fx earnings, increase believability & N will strengthen. The best increase in oil price will do is hold naira @ current level.
2199 2018-07-11 20:12:32 Kelly....what is the post workout body spray with CBD oil that you use?  Btw.....always love watching the show, when I'm not working.     It brightens my mornings.  Thank you for always being real.
2200 2018-07-11 20:12:30 Oil 
2201 2018-07-11 20:12:22 Because Germany can get gas and oil from where ever they like. Yet you still have not imposed the sanctions you said you was going too.
2202 2018-07-11 20:12:22 After 7 glasses of the old oil of negotiation, I'm sure it's a bad omen.

2204 2018-07-11 20:12:08 What kind of oil?
2205 2018-07-11 20:11:55 Only thing ii like is coconut oil... in my hair! 
2206 2018-07-11 20:11:48 Well, I suppose you still have your lottery ticket sales, cans of 1977 Engine Oil and of course the old standby, cigarettes. By the way, NO, young lady they most certainly do not sell condoms in there ... (I’ve asked endlessly but they just refuse to stock ‘em!)  
2207 2018-07-11 20:11:42 will canola oil help with my painful ear? I just put a few drops in & covered with cotton wool  the pain bathong!
2208 2018-07-11 20:11:36 Does coconut oil help yo eyebrows grow? cus these mfs growing lmao

2213 2018-07-11 20:11:01 That was a pretty spectacular failure of judgement on his part. Fortunately, judgement is not needed in an FBI agent?
2214 2018-07-11 20:11:01 I know it's a happy day
2215 2018-07-11 20:11:00 do we buy oil from countries or from the market? As a fungible commodity, do we really know where the oil came from if we bought it off the market?
2216 2018-07-11 20:10:52 Phone on 3% while I’m at the dealership getting my oil changed. Idk why I do this to myself.
2217 2018-07-11 20:10:51 ill take him for the month but only if he comes with a christmas tree hmpf
2218 2018-07-11 20:10:45 What a smoking wreck in oil today. Always remember folks, anything you think you know (ie oil supply constraints, other factors) is already factored in the price & the big boys knew weeks ago. Anything you hear in the media, the institutions knew and positioned in long ago.
2219 2018-07-11 20:10:37 NATO exists to protect Europe from Russia yet Germany and many other NATO countries rely on Russia for the majority of their oil and natural gas.
If it makes sense to you for NATO countries to enrich their "enemy" as well as rely on them for fuel then you should stifle, Meathead.
2220 2018-07-11 20:10:26 (*｀ω´*)ﾄﾞﾔｱｱ
2221 2018-07-11 20:10:22 Something about 24 of 29 countries either not supplying enough troops, currency, or hardware. Along with Russia getting all the oil money we want. And it's just another soap opera type day.
2222 2018-07-11 20:10:18 China is their largest buyer and one with most capacity to buy more. As long as US-China spat is on, China will use that to get cheap oil from Iran. When US-China make up, China will switch from Iran to US. Iran will begin its death spiral then.
2223 2018-07-11 20:10:06 油揚げって言うほど油って感じしなくない？ほんとに騙された気分だよ。
2224 2018-07-11 20:09:54 We like pea pods cooked in Olive oil.  I also buy those chickens and put them in the freezer for future use.  I take the meat off and freeze it.  It's a quick go to for quesadillas, enchiladas, and pulled chicken sandwiches

That means we’ll be streaming all day tomorrow too 
2228 2018-07-11 20:09:35 if that's the claim, then quite obviously snake oil.  look forward to checking this out.
2229 2018-07-11 20:09:35 US didn't have facility to export LNG until very recently and won't be a net exporter until 2022 and ban on exporting oil was only lifted in 2015 but US consumes most of what it produces, so Germany doesn't really have much of a choice, Russia selling, the US isn't
2230 2018-07-11 20:09:28 What do our "allies" like Germany do for us? Buy 70% of their oil and gas from RUSSIA? WTF!
2231 2018-07-11 20:09:23 Surely if world oil prices are consistent, germans pay less on transportation costs from Russia? If I’m not mistaken, Europeans purchase fuel by the liter. A gallon has to be at least nine bucks. Maybe the Russian product is comparable?
2232 2018-07-11 20:09:21 With great leadership comes great responsibility. Fracking is the main reason why we lead oil and gas development. We need to lead on the environmental and social responsibility frontlines, too.
2233 2018-07-11 20:09:14 Serve with a cup of plain soybean oil on the side, aka dipping sauce.
2234 2018-07-11 20:09:14 But we're war hungry right? That's what you said, so why haven't we invaded anyone?? We love start wars right?? Outside of the Western hemisphere what regimes have we subverted? I mean should we subvert Saudi Arabia for cheaper oil, and out a friendly democracy in there

2237 2018-07-11 20:09:02 Where are they going to buy it from????  Iran???  It isn't only Germany that is dependant on Russia oil.  Also, read further, America can't get into the game because they can't afford to sell for less than Russia.
Besides, trump is held captive ny Russia, too.

2241 2018-07-11 20:08:48 So he is wrong about the oil pipeline allowing Russia to control Germany? Come on, Maggy...
2242 2018-07-11 20:08:47 It’d be Poland, the UK, and the Scandinavians who form an alliance to take on Russia. German military is quite frankly inept at this point, and France would use the opportunity to seek out oil and other resources while everyone is distracted.
2243 2018-07-11 20:08:40 It's not a zero sum game - picking up the tab isnt nearly as important as those allies allowing us to place installments and perform operations from their territories, falling in line and supporting us when we need them, and using our currencies when dealing in oil.
2244 2018-07-11 20:08:40 Machine learning is so much snake oil, smoke and mirrors. There’s nothing really new going on here. It’s just got a sexier name, better branding and more computing power now.

2252 2018-07-11 20:07:59 Sorry Germany create and produce self their Energy ,as our small country also! A few european countries bought gas from Russia not more! Gas pipeline, As well the US bought petrol oil from arabic countries
2253 2018-07-11 20:07:40 I don't trade oil or give financial advise but am adding to oil E&P stocks on weakness although honestly most have not moved much today. This isn't real dude.

2262 2018-07-11 20:06:22 You want me to protect you and I can go buy gas and oil from the guy I want you to protect me from?  STUPID!.  Old East German hag concedes Germany to Russia without one gun fired.  Oh she gave muslims the keys to the country.
2263 2018-07-11 20:06:19 Lemon essential oil in water or just fresh organic lemon juice in water. Both have worked for me quickly.

2265 2018-07-11 20:06:12 How is Trump going to take Iran’s oil? That’s not how it works.

2267 2018-07-11 20:06:03 The House needs to explain to the American people why NATO needs USA security & funding when NATO countries buy oil & goods from Russia.
2268 2018-07-11 20:05:53 Stones header would have dramatically ended the match  #CROENG
2269 2018-07-11 20:05:44 Anything at all can actually clog your pores. The key to using oil on your face is using in very little quantity and making sure your face is damp while you do it. That way it won’t feel greasy
2270 2018-07-11 20:05:44 Why is GERMANY BUYING 70% of their natural gas and oil FROM RUSSIA?
2271 2018-07-11 20:05:38 Yes, Putin ordered Trump to decrease Putin's oil sales to Europe. So clever of Vlad.
2272 2018-07-11 20:05:29 I find this utterly disgusting. How on earth can BBC even begin to claim any impartiality at all and just look at the these... snake oil salespersons who masquerade as Labour MPs ! For pity’s sake WAKE UP UK & @jessphillips @lucianaberger join the Tory’s. We deserve better
2273 2018-07-11 20:05:25 And 2:  it never ate oil when I did normal driving.  But when I visited my nephew in Kentucky, it always ate a quart of oil on that long trip.
2274 2018-07-11 20:05:14 I told my best iono if I can party with him for his birthday because my hair not done.. this nigga said f*ck oil sheen and edge control  I’m done 
2275 2018-07-11 20:05:10 Coconut oil to loosen the glue, but you really just gotta snatch em off 
2276 2018-07-11 20:05:02 You could have until Trump cut off oil from one of our main suppliers,  Iran.  Some things you can blame on others, but not that.
2277 2018-07-11 20:04:53 Atleast we know what to expect with cooking oil mwati ni butter?! They will gong'a us easily  zed politics drain me i tell you
2278 2018-07-11 20:04:51 And furthermore, @Dadurfunnymyass, how incredibly patronizing that you think someone who’s been disabled (by a war over oil, no doubt)is above(or below)all human frailty? I imagine a disabled vet can take a little ribbing, just like us non-disabled non-vets.
2279 2018-07-11 20:04:48 Screw that. I won’t humanize him.

He sought to stay in Iran JCPOA to protect France’s Total oil interests.
2280 2018-07-11 20:04:38 the oil alone costs more than that idk what’s goin on lmao
2281 2018-07-11 20:04:35 He didn't say "more dependent", he said "captive of". "If you look at it, Germany is a captive of Russia...". That is gaslighting, trying to make Germany question its own knowledge of its relationship with Russia around oil and gas. And trying to get others to as well.
2282 2018-07-11 20:04:32 $WTI #crude #oil prices settled sharply lower Wednesday, shrugging off a larger-than-expected draw in U.S. crude stockpiles as raising #OPEC output, and the reopening of terminals in Libya dented investor expectations for a global supply shortage.

2284 2018-07-11 20:04:23 could it have anything to do with the fact that afghanistan is sitting on the world's biggest oil field?  karzai was sent by omar to the usa organise a joint venture with the usa to extract the oil - 3 years speaking before congress and failing to do that

2287 2018-07-11 20:04:10 Go away McCain. Massive pool and gas contracts with Russia is not good for NATO. Hmmm wasn’t there a nation that has its oil and gas turned off as part of manipulating its policy before invasion? Just retire and let the governor appoint your replacement. U r Useless

2292 2018-07-11 20:03:40 Lmao. Gas prices have been high since 2015 when oil crashed, nothing to do with @Potus. Second, we cant afford to feed/or house our veterans because we take care of the world financially. Its time America keeps our money.  You need to research your facts b4 U speak.

2298 2018-07-11 20:03:18 It isn’t. I don’t agree with her. It all depends on your skin type. Been using coconut oil on my skin since 2016 and I’ve never had issues. When I stopped using it for some months my skin became bad. I use mild sugar scrub too. The one I agree with is the lime/lemon
2299 2018-07-11 20:03:17 Perhaps some oil?

2302 2018-07-11 20:02:56 Hot take: it's not grown up cooking until the oil+vinegar and garlic come out
2303 2018-07-11 20:02:53 Rebic slide though he almost discovered oil
2304 2018-07-11 20:02:49 A gift to Putin? Lady you are nuts. He called out Germany for not paying their share of NATO and cutting a secret deal to buy oil from Russia. I could go on but you know the truth but will never admit it.
2305 2018-07-11 20:02:33 I initially questioned the concept that Obama dipping into our strategic oil reserve hurt our rivals by asking how it hurts China, our biggest rival. Of course it did'nt. Nor did it hurt NoKo or Iran.
2306 2018-07-11 20:02:25 Dependence on Oil is Bad, Alternative and Nuclear is a good solution but that's like medium term planning, for short term Oil is necessary. Oils mainly necessary 4 transport only, to convert to electric needs far greater sense of good civic responsibility.
2307 2018-07-11 20:02:07 If they were Fosters (oil cans) I’ll be really impressed.
2308 2018-07-11 20:02:05 Wouldn't this mean increased imports from Canada? Such a disruption in the supply chain would need to be covered pronto, and Canada has inverted Himalayas of oil...
2309 2018-07-11 20:02:00 Oil and gas production serve more than just the energy industry. They support the service, transportation and manufacturing industries, all of which employ hundreds of thousands of people in America.
2310 2018-07-11 20:01:57 Events like today will ensure that you see $100 oil.
2311 2018-07-11 20:01:57 Ooooh!  I'll have to see if I can find that here!  I live in Texas, so I've never seen that but I love vitamin C oil.  The women in my family have been using it for like 4 generations religiously and they all look a good 10-15 years younger than they are.
2312 2018-07-11 20:01:55 Sometimes when i hit my oil pen the smoke goes up my nose and it feels like I got water in my nose. I hope it gets me higher
2313 2018-07-11 20:01:42 I swear that banana mush has a gallon of OIL in it because nothing should be that GREASY
2314 2018-07-11 20:01:32 If Germany is paying for gas and oil that means (wait for it) they are receiving gas and oil. I didn’t realize this was such a difficult concept to understand.
2315 2018-07-11 20:01:12 And we have nukes in the volatile sh*thole country
2316 2018-07-11 20:01:08 Yes, but one was watercolour, one was oil and one was..reggae.
2317 2018-07-11 20:01:06 I used to have the BIGGEST crush on this guy but you know Aba was a shy girl hiding in my house. Tell me why he just slid in my DMs on Instagram. My mom’s anointing oil is powerful. I only used it last night n this morning  come for some.
2318 2018-07-11 20:01:05 If anyone wants to add to my essential oil collection, feel free
2319 2018-07-11 20:01:05 Absolute nonsense. Blame the CARBS and the n-6 PUFA loaded "fit for soap making" indl vegetable oils sold as healthy. Best oil VCO.
2320 2018-07-11 20:00:57 Gas and oil is an international commodity.  Who gives a shit where you buy their fuels
2321 2018-07-11 20:00:56 They can't get that oil off their brain
2322 2018-07-11 20:00:52 But, Minister, the dead birds? The crushed turtles? The oil spills? Not sure about plastic straws though...
2323 2018-07-11 20:00:48 @GG_RMC @DanielRiolo devient un chroniqueur récurrent cette saison ? Ou juste quand oil y a un sujet foot ?
2324 2018-07-11 20:00:41 Re: # 3 He wants people (the world, in fact) to buy oil from Russia. He’s just trying to 1st position himself to be one of the owners/recipients (read: Oligarchs) before they do so. He’s just stupid enough to think Putin is really gonna cut him in on the deal. #TrumpsBeingPunked

“Why are NATO members buying oil from #Russia while the US is the one protecting NATO?”
SG: “We need to work with Russia and we’ll all be stronger.”
Trump: “All your doing is making Russia richer.”

2331 2018-07-11 20:00:24 @ShepNewsTeam You know you are very hard for me to listen too. If Germany cared a hoot about the US why is she buying her oil from Russia? And everyone is worried that our Pres. Is too friendly with Putan.
2332 2018-07-11 20:00:20 For my face I mix custor oil with pure tea tree oil. I apply this mixer twice a day it also works well as a base before I apply foundation.
2333 2018-07-11 20:00:19 The variables transcend increase in oil price. There must be sufficient supply of USD and we don’t print. Investors have sold N instruments, bought USD and transferred invsts offshore, uncertainty around preelection yr & yields locally aren’t as attractive as they were. 22%vs13%.
2334 2018-07-11 20:00:19 As a tiny baby, he rolls out of his crib, brushes his hair and teeth, lathers up in baby oil and just chills pool side with a nice cold glass of milk.
2335 2018-07-11 20:00:14 So, it seems I may have been running the same engine oil for almost 20k miles?
2336 2018-07-11 20:00:14 I am sure he is.  And with new tariffs coming and prices of oil, propane, natural gas and coal likely to rise, his old bosses will love him!
2337 2018-07-11 20:00:13 Sitting at the dealership for an oil change. Then added fuel filter change, and rear differential. I’m glad it’s a layed back kind’ve day. With #LegDay already done with. Just need to do laundry and meal prep later. #HumpDayGrind #HAGD
2338 2018-07-11 20:00:13 Putin's plan all along. Get Trump elected, then cause an economic boom in the U.S., then order Trump to cut Russian oil & gas imports into the E.U.

Coming soon to a Dem politician near you.

2339 2018-07-11 19:59:53 Oklahoma Health Department suggests players have a qualified physician apply the oil to players that participate in this disrespectful act. 

Probably.
2340 2018-07-11 19:59:51 They're trying to make Russia take the blame for their vile sedition and crimes against humanity! I will push for European countries to BUY OIL from RUSSIA. Russia is NOT our enemy. The EU is our enemy.. along with the UN.
2341 2018-07-11 19:59:51 We are more than trump, nato, oil, pollution, wars, hatred, hunger, death, but if we do not change we will always be remembered as just that!
2342 2018-07-11 19:59:50 The President said Germany was becoming “captive to Russia”.Talking to Stoltenberg over the breakfast table, the President said: “…it is very sad when Germany makes a massive oil and gas deal with Russia, where we’re supposed to be guarding against Russia, and Germany goes -

2345 2018-07-11 19:59:37 Getting Oil Changed. 1st place “we don’t have anybody here. Come back in an hour and a half.” 2nd place(next door) “yes sir. Please give me your keys.” Out in 20 mins. 1st place, empty. 2nd place packed. Business 101.
2346 2018-07-11 19:59:35 When I first heard (back march) that the government consulted 300,000 Canadians on this my head nearly exploded. This entire exercise has been about shielding the oil patch from the stark reality that it's days are numbered and allow them to seek out subsidy for meaningless R&D
2347 2018-07-11 19:59:26 Why not?  They did for Calgary when oil pooped it’s pants in 2014
2348 2018-07-11 19:59:25 Since when is Trump anti Oil and Gas? Oh well Germany can just speed up their transition to renewables.
2349 2018-07-11 19:59:15 No wonder ,what's your IP lemme send a virtual signal to u Oga 
2350 2018-07-11 19:58:54 In what way? Today he railed on Germany for buying Russian oil, while demanding NATO members pay their fair share. Do you realize that if the goal was to actually destroy Russia economically, these countries could stop buying oil from Russia and do it.

2354 2018-07-11 19:58:05 I don’t care how much fiat paper money the ECB and Federal Reserve print,it still ain’t gonna rain OIL or GAS or Phosphorous or Any other resource that’s running out.Once prices go through the roof as demand outweighs supply,Hyper inflation kicks in.
2355 2018-07-11 19:57:44 I am sorry. Can't remember though.
2356 2018-07-11 19:57:43 Seems clear relying on enemy states for essential, profitable oil allows them to buy more bullets and bombs. One wonders though, what Merkel  thinks of Trump having private WH meetings with top level Russians, fighting Russian sanctions and ignoring Crimea? Russia plays everyone.

2364 2018-07-11 19:57:18 Church hurt can be avoided with “mature conversation”. I was a CHILD. Y’all poured oil down my throat to purge my homosexual demons meanwhile I’m at home suicudal and cutting myself. Fuck y’all, for real.
2365 2018-07-11 19:57:17 The Russian economy is in the tank. Can't afford own pensions. Oil companies aren't profitable. But somehow have high performance hackers?
2366 2018-07-11 19:57:08 LOL. Right, better dependant on Russian gas and oil than on US energy with Trump in the white house.
2367 2018-07-11 19:57:02 Pleeease stop using oil on your hair!!!! Especially flat ironed!
2368 2018-07-11 19:56:48 Cronenberg and the bottom line: "The painter Willem de Kooning said: “Flesh is the reason oil paint was invented.” I say, the human body is the reason cinema was invented.

2371 2018-07-11 19:56:19 @hap317 Appears OIL is not out the woods yet.
2372 2018-07-11 19:56:17 Basic products work better than big brand store bought cleansers. Regular dove Bar soap, raw African black soap, alcohol, witch hazel, raw coconut oil or shea butter for a moisturizer. 
2373 2018-07-11 19:56:07 Just think how much water Scotland sends to England and work out how much that is worth. Now, think of Scottish oil that is accounted for in England, or places that apparently don’t exist, so as to prevent the value being attributed to Scotland. #YouYesYet?
2374 2018-07-11 19:56:05 Yes agree, the crude oil price dropped from! $110+ to $35, how much did the fuel price drop by? Need a commission of enquiry into this one. Multinationals and government taking us for a ride at our cost.

2377 2018-07-11 19:55:56 Simply coat your hair with olive oil and leave it in for a few hours
2378 2018-07-11 19:55:53 They could be taking their "cod liver oil"
2379 2018-07-11 19:55:51 Spot on..there is far too much headline surfing on soc media...and the Nats rely on that totally..

It's the trend that matters...in any data..the trend is your friend ...or the trend is your dead end.  

At the mo...on oil for Scotland the trend is a fake friend

2383 2018-07-11 19:55:41 Lemon is a great oil reducer and Acne stopper,but it's best used at night. U aren't supposed to come in contact with sun for at least 5hours after using a lemon based product.

2386 2018-07-11 19:55:17 So your point is Europe shouldn't buy oil from Russia bx Russia medled in the US election? But the president is having closed door meetings with him and talking of releasing sanctions.
2387 2018-07-11 19:55:14 Outstanding. Trump tells it the way it is. Europe is Russia's customer for oil & natural gas, but the USA provides military defense to Europe to protect them from Russia. Ridiculous. NATO countries need to dramatically increase the % of GDP that they're paying. No more free ride.
2388 2018-07-11 19:55:11 We are still celebrating OIL DAY with 20% off all of our wax, concentrate and rosin!!
2389 2018-07-11 19:55:09 I'm sure with oil prices, as they are the leases won't expire and oil won't be left in the ground. This is one exciting main market share to hold
2390 2018-07-11 19:55:03 Almost like their opposition to Iraq had nothing to do with "wars for oil" but everything to do with Saddam's unlimited right to kill Iraqis being infringed.

Supports 100,000+ jobs for hardworking New Mexicans
Contributes $12.8 billion annually to the state’s economy
Supplies one-third of the revenue for New Mexico's General Fund

2397 2018-07-11 19:54:26 Putin wants Germany to buy oil from Russia. Trump doesn’t want them to. Trump wants NATO countries to pay more..in what way would a better funded NATO be good for Putin? Crazy ass libs
2398 2018-07-11 19:54:17 Gold and oil are going down like Messerschmitts after a run in with a bunch of Spitfires.
2399 2018-07-11 19:53:57 Yeah he’s so “controlled by Russia” that he’s blasting Germany for buying Russian oil? Mitchell is such an illogical hack! 
2400 2018-07-11 19:53:49 Oh man, BB has always been disastrous on me. It’s all oil.
2401 2018-07-11 19:53:32 Also oops! U.S. buys around $10 million worth of energy (mostly oil) from Russia.

2419 2018-07-11 19:52:00 What's an ally nowadays anyway Jack? We are at Peace. There will be no  WW3 among nations. What you're missing is money makes the world  go-round. And Russia is not our enemy anymore. Why are WE buying so much  oil from the M.E.?
2420 2018-07-11 19:51:57 Russia and Saudi have absolutely zero short term memory--they worked for years, through production cuts, to get oil up to $75, from $26--now they're gonna increase production like crazy; they forgot, that will simply drive it back down to $26--Oooops
2421 2018-07-11 19:51:55 ok, one thing on your oil and gas, mr. energy dominance: better keep it for yourself. you will need it, maybe soon. your own industry is a freaking ponzi-scheme reliant on one or two unconventional plays and that piled up a ridiculous amount of dept. crawl back to the saudis.

2425 2018-07-11 19:51:41 Seems to me that other countries have taken advantage of us for years.  The  has always payed more than our fair share of cost of NATO.  So tell me how we are in bed with Russia?  Germany buys there oil and gas from them..  Wake up!!
2426 2018-07-11 19:51:41 I hope DJT Leaves NATO. No way we can depend on Germany as an ally, ever!  Also, the US hasn't built any new Oil refineries since the 1970s. We need more of them. What good is all our big oil supply if we don't have enough refineries?
2427 2018-07-11 19:51:34 My flat iron pretty good tho I don’t really need it the olive oil keep it tucked a Lil more especially after I wrap it I don’t like when my ends bend funky lol
2428 2018-07-11 19:51:26 Poor starving man finally killed by an oil spill.
2429 2018-07-11 19:51:26 I agree regarding oil usage. Mine sits in the middle.

2432 2018-07-11 19:51:15 Oh ok. Guess I should have looked closer. I have not been to the Billings track for a few years but I know its under new mgmt. Good luck to you this week.
2433 2018-07-11 19:51:00 Change your name to the Amsterdam news. All you report is race issues.  Try a new flavor. Maybe why is gas so high when oil is low. Rag news.
2434 2018-07-11 19:51:00 the titties also dripping in olive oil, of course
2435 2018-07-11 19:50:59 I had a problem with the motor on the back wiper blade on my truck. Gun oil fixed it right up!
2436 2018-07-11 19:50:50 Smells like motor oil
2437 2018-07-11 19:50:49 Very cunning fellow. The way he talks itself you can make out :) Like they say proverb - He puts oil on his body and sits.
2438 2018-07-11 19:50:47 Diese Statistik ist eigentlich gesagt nur unnötig.
2439 2018-07-11 19:50:39 Trump speaks very plainly Agent not hard to decipher . 
Why is Europe buying oil from Russia ?  But that don’t fit the narrative does it 
2440 2018-07-11 19:50:32 Hold up! if the country you get your oil from controls you then does this mean Canada controls the US??? cause I got a few changes I'd like to make.
2441 2018-07-11 19:50:28 My hair got some act right today ! I’m walking round here without olive oil thanks to DIA lOl

*Its 4PM* 

Me: Is there time for an Oil Change by chance?

Me: Haha yeah sorry..
*5 second silence*
Me: So should I go elsewhere? *smirks, giggle*
Emp: Yes, Probably.

They close @ 5

2445 2018-07-11 19:50:05 Salad: cherry tomatoes, red onion, yellow pepper, cucumber, paw paw/pineapple 

Dressing: olive oil, parsley, chili paste, lemon juice, salt&pepper

Twist: add couscous. Cook the couscous with chicken stalk to add flavour.

Mix everything together in one bowl and serve
2446 2018-07-11 19:49:58 It's popular in that people buy it. But if you put oil on a public opinion poll with other energy sources, it would probably be ranked second to last. It needs a Dr. Stranglove campaign like "How I learned to stop worried and embrace the barrel."

2450 2018-07-11 19:49:45 Really?
Kerry gives $150bb to a terrorist supporting regime, tours the world apologizing for the USA and serves up appeasement to it enemies.
And it’s ok for Germany to purchase the majority of its natural gas and oil from Russia?
Really?
2451 2018-07-11 19:49:42 Congratulations

moisturizing your skin with virgin coconut oil can help soften and soothe the skin and make it easier to shave.

use aloe vera cream after you shave to reduce redness.
2454 2018-07-11 19:49:20 $Oil dropping isn't a good sign!
2455 2018-07-11 19:49:14 As for the "damage" the previous admin did to our country...More of that is made up than not. Yes, Obama did things I don't agree with...siding with Big Oil on many occasions, not helping those trying to protect their lands from oil spills that DID happen.

2495 2018-07-11 19:45:26 Trumpy please talk to someone who understands buying stuff and paying bills for what you bought.  We have not fully paid our bill to nato but paying for gas and oil is another issue. Ask your wife.
2496 2018-07-11 19:45:24 Bullshit. Trump is just angry because Germany hasn’t asked about buying American oil. He wants German money but Merkel keeps giving him the

2508 2018-07-11 19:44:41 Renewables are more expensive now but they look more competitive when oil is over $100 a barrel. This is why a petrostate minister is really worried about demand destruction when he says he is worried about supply.

2523 2018-07-11 19:43:15 Meanwhile you ignore how the dependency of gas and oil from Russia has caused countries to be invaded by Russia. You clowns are hysterical. Tearing up a huge gas contract between GER and RUS is not pro Russia. Clowns.
2524 2018-07-11 19:42:59 The fact that Germany is giving billions of dollars to Russia in an oil pipeline deal is inappropriate.

2525 2018-07-11 19:42:59 @realDonaldTrump Pres. Trump is CORRECT! Why should the USA continue to pay NATO 4% of our GDP, to protect all the other countries in NATO, while they are buying 80% of their oil/gas from Russia, who the USA is protecting them from? They are not even paying their 2% of their GDP?

2531 2018-07-11 19:42:49 Yet somehow the rosehip is fantastic even though it’s an oil - but for creams and stuff get like hyrdrating gels/lighter creams.
2532 2018-07-11 19:42:37 We are producing enough oil and natural gas here to more than take care of Europe’s needs as well as our own. You would think that they would prefer to business with their allies!
2533 2018-07-11 19:42:36 I acknowledge the point, but the crude that goes into new pipelines for "line fill" becomes, in a sense, "dead oil" that just primes more pumps.  This is true worldwide and not just in the US and second half 2019 will see huge demand for line fill on new pipelines from Permian.

Before US began its campaign to begin energy independence & relied on oil from MidEast, were we owned by OPEC? Were others? Nope
2540 2018-07-11 19:42:10 I will later when I step outside again . I must confess I did a “treatment “ I saw on YouTube with baking soda , been oil and dish soap .  I noticed that black on the leaves and washed off really good the next day . 
2541 2018-07-11 19:42:09 How about Germany doesn't buy oil and natural gas from Russia and buys it from us instead.  Deal? That was Trump's point.  Germany imperils the Baltic States and then Germany no the US.

2554 2018-07-11 19:41:26 Plus we buy a ton of Russian oil. Someone should ask him about that.
2555 2018-07-11 19:41:21 Ah, but the view of what is a bad leader is different, depending what faction you're in.  The racists saw Obama as the end of the world.  So did the oil/coal plutocrats because he took global warming seriously.  I see Trump as an ignorant destructive genocidal child; others don't

2564 2018-07-11 19:40:34 I was putting my face oil on to go to sleep this dummy going say that’s why your face be slipping off the pillows 
2565 2018-07-11 19:40:31 え…エルザとは…別に…な…(ﾀﾞｯ
2566 2018-07-11 19:40:15 How many times does the U.S. have to bail out Europe? They want us to protect them from Russia,but sell oil to Russia.
 It is to much,the U.S. should let the the Europeans protect themselves and get out of NATO. Next time don't call on the U.S. when you are invaded.
2567 2018-07-11 19:40:13 Russia will be part of a new multi-polar EU - it supplies EU with oil - Russia as with the entire planet is worried about $ - if the USA goes the whole world suffers --- BTW with the OBOR taking shape and the petrol-yuan this is not about Russia as a military power

2569 2018-07-11 19:40:08 So she could get an oil change whenever she wants 
2570 2018-07-11 19:40:07 I read it all. Condemning a post for simply mentioning cannabis because you feel just that slight mention will urge pet owners to blindly shove any form of cannabis neglectfully into the pets face is shortsighted. CBD oil is fine and is medicine and should be stored like meds.
2571 2018-07-11 19:40:07 Infants in jail covered in lice with no blankets, air conditioning, medical care, bath, food or water but Paul Manafort a guy who ordered protesters murdered & facilitated the fall of two democracies so an oil baron could ruin the planet beyond repair has a laptop & a phone.
2572 2018-07-11 19:40:07 U.S. oil price plunges 5%, Brent -7% as Libyan production returns
2573 2018-07-11 19:40:05 Whatever you do, don't go into their building covered in your own pubes and oil.
2574 2018-07-11 19:40:04 If Merkel were serious about NATO she wouldn't be diverting the billions she owes NATO and giving it to Putin.  Oil is Russia's ONLY business.  She's supporting Russia and asking the US to make up HER COUNTRY'S difference - and then some - paying for NATO.  Words vs Action.
2575 2018-07-11 19:40:03 Trump ask OPEC to increase oil out put to bring down prices, and they did! Trump said it would act against Pfizer for increasing drug prices and they called the White House the next day, said they would bring prices down.  World leaders and industry Know Trump is a Real Leader
2576 2018-07-11 19:39:53 I look dugyot af with this oil burn on my hand
2577 2018-07-11 19:39:50 I guess buying Russian oil is a good alternative?
2578 2018-07-11 19:39:48 Delayed start for #Sidecars #S100 oil spill
2579 2018-07-11 19:39:43 I think it's like 20% of their energy comes from oil so like 15 or 17% of that comes from Russia so it's not really a big number
2580 2018-07-11 19:39:35 Yearly amount of dependant tax is roughly equals to a weeks oil production. (Considering $40 a barrel)....but replacement of skills (either leaving, or not concentrating) can be more damaging then the apparent gain. Let it go and relieve the expats with this burden.
2581 2018-07-11 19:39:33 Tried coconut oil and Shea butter but Sweet almond oil works best for m . Just use it to take off makeup and it doesn't clog pores / cause acne or make your skin dark.

2583 2018-07-11 19:39:31 Oil mill junction.
2584 2018-07-11 19:39:04 My CBD oil was 300 milligrams. My doctors office sold it for 60$. It would work but wear off quickly. My doctor kept telling me to take more which became expensive. I brought a Hemp 500 mil I find that one helps much better with pain.
2585 2018-07-11 19:38:58 Hi. True a lots of room to improve and innovate. You’re totally right electricity will take over but not in the next 35 years though. I don’t know about oil but I think I know about electricity. Lol.
2586 2018-07-11 19:38:46 Of course you wouldn’t because City don’t have any European titles, hence why people still don’t take oil moneyFC seriously.  
2587 2018-07-11 19:38:33 Memories of the Foul Bachelor Frog meme.
2588 2018-07-11 19:38:32 Personally, I'd find a knee bandage and some cod liver oil capsules for Gary Pallister at this point. Couldn't hurt.

And also stop passing to people who are not there. Take a bit more care.

2589 2018-07-11 19:38:19 The important thing is middle eastern countries is that they took the oil, they didn’t hand it over to private companies, they took control of it and used it to build the country.. same as Lybia under Gadaffi
2590 2018-07-11 19:38:05 Hi sir
Is crude oil down will effect to Reliance shares?
2591 2018-07-11 19:38:03 Trump called Saudi Prince last week; increase oil production! They did. Prices collapse in massive, commodity wide selloff today; trade war fears, too.
2592 2018-07-11 19:37:46 It was tried to calm down the tensions, We don't always have to be at war with Eurasia you know? Tell that to the Saudis whose citizens brought down the Towers and with whom your are gladly buying oil from.
2593 2018-07-11 19:37:41 Russia has Germany by the *alls. They accidentally shut down the spigot Germany is toast. Make the oil embargo seem like a day in the park
2594 2018-07-11 19:37:31 I hate getting my oil changed 
2595 2018-07-11 19:37:25 Trump called Saudi Prince last week; increase oil production! They did. Prices collapse in massive, commodity wide selloff today; trade war fears, too.
2596 2018-07-11 19:37:18 He is ridiculously ignorant. But why is he trashing German as to using Russia’s oil? Isn’t that helping Big Daddy?
2597 2018-07-11 19:37:12 call for　～を呼び求める、必要とする

The recipe doesn't call for white truffle oil! What else you have…You are improvising!?
2598 2018-07-11 19:37:08 I like cerave, they have a foaming one for more oily skin and a moisturizing one for dry skin. I also do an oil cleansing thing if you're looking to get heavy into skincare, I love talking about it lol
2599 2018-07-11 19:37:08 The bicarbonate thing is good though. Add a few drops of lavender oil if you’ve got some x
2600 2018-07-11 19:36:55 WW1 - US participation 2½ years after start of war.
WW2 - Did not give a F*** for Europe for 2 years, then Pearl Harbor woke US up.
Korea - A war kept alive and Lost by US.
Vietnam - Total loss for US
Kuwait - Loss of enormous amount of oil rescources. US loose.
2601 2018-07-11 19:36:53 They also won't call for EU & Nato members to boycott Russian oil and gas.

This is a joke
2602 2018-07-11 19:36:48 Does the USA not collude with the Saudis (biggest sponsor of terrorists) when we buy the bulk of their oil? Or how natural gas from Yemen, or trump and his daughter doing all their manufacturing in China or Trump borrowing millions from Russian banks? Just curious...
2603 2018-07-11 19:36:47 *oil and gas... But, SPOT ON @ananavarro! Love this.
2604 2018-07-11 19:36:35 It's important to distinguish between an economic sector (oil and gas) and fiscal management. Alberta's been too dependent on oil and gas as a source of fiscal revenues.
2605 2018-07-11 19:36:34 Prior to Mully who did we have to build debt-pick and choose how you like libs caused more debt each time they were in-From P. E. T -Chrétien now Hermi.. who has ruined our oil our trade and brought in terrorists keep drinking your lib cool-aide or shut your eyes wide open
2606 2018-07-11 19:36:31 If you are going to be at #jeepnight this weekend and need some AMSOIL for your ride, hit us up! We will bring the oil to you if you order before 2pm friday! #texasmotorspeedway #AMSOIL
2607 2018-07-11 19:36:05 Why not just use a Visa? My Chase Visa has no issues with me buying $cvsi cbd oil.
2608 2018-07-11 19:36:04 He's just just trying to say that they are hypocrites. He knows they won't change the purchasing choices by the EU of Russian oil. It's a totally safe attack. It just gives him cover to make him seem less like Putin's puppet.
2609 2018-07-11 19:36:00 Sure he does arms sales for U.S. And gas and oil deals
2610 2018-07-11 19:35:55 then put some oil on it and u made urself a poronta
2611 2018-07-11 19:35:47 How is this legal with the restrictions on  recreational oil?
2612 2018-07-11 19:35:43 I’ve needed an oil change for like 4 months hehe I’m just now going I love being a irresponsible
2613 2018-07-11 19:35:42 You prepared to supply Germany with gas and oil?  Or let Iran do it?
2614 2018-07-11 19:35:34 Coal is bad for land, oil spills are bad for land and water, some of those countries that are on the travel ban for Trump and were for Obama shouldn’t have been, and some that weren’t should have. Global warming is a thing, however it is because of an increase in Methane gas...
2615 2018-07-11 19:35:33 that’s not an answer but a convenient way for the US to define any nation with resources (oil) as an enemy lol.
2616 2018-07-11 19:35:09 250 gr of bulgur

500 gr of chopped steak

salt

Pepper

4 spices (ground black cardamom, cinnamon, ground coriander, ground clove)

3 medium onions

4 tablespoons oïl

cooking oil
2617 2018-07-11 19:34:59 What about Russia’s OIL?
2618 2018-07-11 19:34:58 This is much more than solely about NATO contributions.  Michael just doesn’t see the whole picture.  Trade, oil, natural gas, defense....
2619 2018-07-11 19:34:58 And then understanding that those who don't learn their history are doomed to repeat it. Alberta needs to break up with non-renewable resources quick, because I think the oil industry is using up time the environment hasn't got.
2620 2018-07-11 19:34:57 @VP THE EU BECOMES POWERLESS NO ELECTRICITY NO OIL NO GAS, NOTHING MOVES. THE EU WILL BE OVERRUN IN DAYS!

NOW PEOPLE ARE SAYING PRES. TRUMP IS NUTS, DON'T THINK SO.
2621 2018-07-11 19:34:51 Taste testing the new @CountryCrock with sunflower oil. It is awesome. Gluten free and has a much lighter taste than the normal country crock. Taste wonderful on my gluten free toast! #countrycrock #sunfloweroil #glutenfree
2622 2018-07-11 19:34:42 @VP LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT! EUROPE WANTS TO BUY THEIR GAS AND OIL FROM RUSSIA EVEN PUTTING A PIPE LINE INTO GERMANY.

THEY WANT THE USA TO PAID FOR EVERYTHING TO PROTECT THEM FROM RUSSIA

SO AFTER THE PIPE LINE IS IN, ALL RUSSIA HAS TO DO IS SHUT DOWN THE PIPE LINE!
2623 2018-07-11 19:34:33 I knew England would be punished  #CROENG

2625 2018-07-11 19:34:17 That is not an argument. Since he is chastising Germany for giving Russia BILLIONS, bombed Syria TWICE including after Russia warned him not to & is working to lower oil costs (bad for Russia because their oil production is expensive). PLEASE tell us how POTUS is helping Russia?
2626 2018-07-11 19:34:13 The last time Oil was at it's current price, we were paying about $0.86/L at the pump

2628 2018-07-11 19:34:00 Caffeine Rush with coffee extract by Callysee. Lots of glycerol and argan oil so it's probably gonna make me break out tho.
2629 2018-07-11 19:33:57 But but the dirty oil money won us the league and broke all the records their 'ambition' could never achieve  
2630 2018-07-11 19:33:56 Oil bears by the look of it
2631 2018-07-11 19:33:55 #ENGCRO can someone get the Croatian team some lavender oil they seem to be slightly angry 
2632 2018-07-11 19:33:53 I want my scalp massaged, with oil.
2633 2018-07-11 19:33:47 I suspect he found a new show hence oils reaction. Now I'm looking forward for the next nasty arrow down hump, and today's notebook. I want to get to 66-65 this cycle......at least :)
2634 2018-07-11 19:33:44 Germany is buying oil from Russia because it is the lesser of two evils.
2635 2018-07-11 19:33:43 Well Irving’s own oil tankers?
2636 2018-07-11 19:33:34 This isn't correct. If sanctions make it harder for Iran to sell oil, they end up having to sell it at a discount, which does hurt them. They don't have to stop the oil from coming onto the market altogether. Buyers are aware if a seller has restricted options.
2637 2018-07-11 19:33:31 9% of Germany's oil comes from Russia. It's not controlled by nor dependent on Russia.
2638 2018-07-11 19:33:28 0 defense for Europe let them freeze when they in tussle with Russia they shut down the oil and gas

2640 2018-07-11 19:33:22 If he is/was unsure about it like that lady said, I hope he decides to embrace it and grow it until it’s three inches thick and oil it and have the fullest, fluffiest, cutest mustache ever. Lol
2641 2018-07-11 19:33:20 Try CBD oil, if your state allows it. Takes about a month to notice a change but it helps with sleep, anxiety and depression.
2642 2018-07-11 19:33:16 With our technology and process we turn trim into distillate oil, and we use a couple of different systems for short path depending on whether it's for the fixed location or mobile. We also have systems for BHO, Rosin, and on-boarding a CO2 machine.
2643 2018-07-11 19:33:16 Ever pissed in the shower? When you weren’t taking a shower?
2644 2018-07-11 19:33:10 US gets a large percentage of its oil from Canada and Mexico. Haven't noticed Trump admitting that we're being "controlled" by either.
2645 2018-07-11 19:33:08 I hate war. It is always because politics, money or oil. 
And who dies in wars?? People that don't even get anything of it. Only to thinking it is for protecting their country. War hasn't helped anyone
2646 2018-07-11 19:33:00 I don't even want to smoke pot, I'm just manually extracting the cbd oil
2647 2018-07-11 19:33:00 The “cbd” oil they sell in other states isn’t the same thing. It doesn’t have close to the same effect
2648 2018-07-11 19:32:54 "I hate when ppl do that shiny anime shit stop drawing shines all over your art. It's gross."
Me: *begins pouring a whole bottle of oil on my tablet screen* y'all hear summn?
2649 2018-07-11 19:32:51 Nah, that isn't happening anywhere but in the fantasies of anti-SJW snake oil salesmen. 

In reality, the far-leftist coalition is booming across the globe. Hell, I just attended a DSA meeting in OKLAHOMA that had increased from only about 6 people to over 50 between two meetings
2650 2018-07-11 19:32:38 turns out i’m a slut for naan and hummus w olive oil and paprika
2651 2018-07-11 19:32:35 Oil recovery and Chinese outbound investment saved the day.
2652 2018-07-11 19:32:19 My exhusband works oil fields up that way he said it was close
2653 2018-07-11 19:32:19 if I only could recall whose oil companies are headed by whose ex prime ministers.
and whose oil policies are critizised for being too pro-who by its eastern neigbours who were occupied by who knows who for decades.

but I cannot.
;-)
2654 2018-07-11 19:32:16 Getting an oil change and Leger Douzable in here watching the world cup game and spilled his water all over smh
2655 2018-07-11 19:32:15 Your right Mr. President! How does Germany say "protect us from Russia" then buy Russia's oil & not ours. If they are wanting our country to protect them then buy thyeir oil from us.
2656 2018-07-11 19:32:12 America was attacked in 2001 and we still buy Saudi Arabian oil.
2657 2018-07-11 19:32:12 He's wrong. Germany only gets 9% of its oil from Russia. Fact check Trump always. He tries constantly to pass off severely false statements and ridiculous numbers.
2658 2018-07-11 19:32:08 it won't do anything drastic, especially if you have synthetic oil, but it might eventually shorten the life of your engine or make it run louder
2659 2018-07-11 19:32:08 also the art is just too different for Og Atalante its like an oil painting
2660 2018-07-11 19:32:04 For instance, if you were 18 in 1962, you had the following happen...

2663 2018-07-11 19:31:53 im at a family friends pool, and her granddaughters are here and they asked me if i was wearing sunscreen and before i could even answer one of them goes ‘i bet you think tanning oil is sunscreen, it’s not. you’re going to get cancer’                             i feel attacked
2664 2018-07-11 19:31:47 I love the duplicity of globalists in blaming Russia for everything including a crooked toenail, but then they go & sign these huge oil/natural gas deals, becoming truly beholden to Russia--and they want to undermine the credibility of our elections. Let's drop the BS & get real.
2665 2018-07-11 19:31:46 Crude oil dropped by a whooping 183 as of today's closing... World indices dropped or traded range bound yesterday.

Nifty is more likely to be volatile. Crucial resistance at 10985. Suggest to trade cautiously for next few days.
2666 2018-07-11 19:31:46 Hi Chris. We're sorry, that does look to be a "needs oil" indicator. You can contact the location to confirm or a swap as well.~CK
2667 2018-07-11 19:31:44 Blown I had to stop watching the game to get an oil change before work BUT homeboy at the Shell had it on his phone #WorldCup #CustomerService
2668 2018-07-11 19:31:28 @realDonaldTrump you realise oil represents just 20% of Germany's energy? A little different to your statement today saying they get 60% of all energy from Russia. #factcheck
2669 2018-07-11 19:31:27 yea so ima just put oil in it & hopefully it can last til Wednesday

2672 2018-07-11 19:31:06 I keep inhaling my calming lavender aromatherapy oil but it’s not working.
2673 2018-07-11 19:31:06 If anything will stope me its the fact its 90% oil and my hair and face can already produce enough oil to feed the american petrol market daily already so I cant really use it.
2674 2018-07-11 19:31:03 I was suppose to get an oil change this morning I’m so lazy
2675 2018-07-11 19:30:49 Best to look at the inside of the oil filler cap. If it’s coated in a nasty greenish brownish frothy sludge, you’re in trouble... coolant in your oil.

2685 2018-07-11 19:29:56 Germany is not only dependent on Russia that they have a special $ deal that other Nato members don’t. Why does Germany need OIL when you’re all about “clean energy”. Your previous chancellors have exited office rich men. Merkel is on the take from Putin.
2686 2018-07-11 19:29:53 It wasn't about money but resources... USA had iron, coal, oil/fuel and soldiers. Lots of "fresh" soldiers.

2697 2018-07-11 19:29:12 Albertans still invested in oil need to invest in something new. Alberta needs to invest in something new. Whether oil and gas will become feasible again is one thing but the industry will never be the same. It just won't. The world moves on

Indian Concerns

- Election year leading to uncertainty 

- Rise in Crude Oil price leading to widening of fiscal deficit.

- Current Valuation are still expensive, as earnings has to catch up with the valuation.

Insane oil is allowed to move like it does

2710 2018-07-11 19:28:33 Now we're cooking with oil! Cmon penalty kicks.
2711 2018-07-11 19:28:30 Ok! Now all you have to do is look into making the US the leader in alternative energy sources. Then noone is dependent on fossil fuels. It needs to happen before countries waste the lives of their military fighting for oil. Oh, wait.

2718 2018-07-11 19:27:58 Ha I know how he got to the figure of 70%: We import 40% of gas from Russia and 30 of oil from Russia; 40% plus 30% = 70% = baby level math.
We also use a lot of renewable enegy, oil we import from 23 different countries,
2719 2018-07-11 19:27:56 Let ppl smoke what they want.....in the privacy of their homes.  Those of us who don’t smoke....aka the majority would be very grateful for this.  If you smoke pot for health reasons then you don’t need the high and you can consume the oil.
2720 2018-07-11 19:27:55 Interesting read, but I find it a bit hypocritical that Norway's sovereign wealth fund (aka its "oil" fund) is pulling out of two coal-intensive utilities (PAC and Tri-State) b/c of "environmental damage" when the fund itself is comprised of offshore oil and gas drilling revenues
2721 2018-07-11 19:27:49 Crude oil prices drop sharply. Watch out for oil-linked stocks #Stockstowatch

2732 2018-07-11 19:26:57 Saudi Arabia. That's why oil is where it is tou redneck morons. Its not Trudeaus fault and it isn't Notleys. Both of them are trying to bring back oil pipelines but you still think they're the problem. #oilistheproblem

2740 2018-07-11 19:25:59 Oil would be watery. And water would be oily. You’d know. Is it misfiring?
2741 2018-07-11 19:25:54 Inland S. Africans are dumb. The white man used taxes to develop petrol, diesel, paraffin and oil from low grade coal. SASOL doesnt use imported oil. Plants are on the highveld. Why do we pay dollar prices for crude we don't buy, and pipleline costs to pump the non-existing crude
2742 2018-07-11 19:25:48 That is not correct that pipeline is Pre Merkel. In fact, the previous German Chancellor is on the board of Russia's largest oil company making millions.

2744 2018-07-11 19:25:41 Absolutely. I am sure Putin is absolutely thrilled absolutely I am sure who can is absolutely thrilled that Trump is trying to fuck Russia by getting Germany to stop buying billions of dollars worth of oil and natural gas from them lol

2746 2018-07-11 19:25:36 @ShepNewsTeam @FoxNews the opening Story by Sheppard Smith about NATO was so disingenuous in that he hates trump. Germany is enriching in Russia by buying its oil!

2753 2018-07-11 19:25:14 It’s not what we get. It’s what Trump gets. Billions in so called loans and probably forgiveness of past loans. And, shares in Rosefet? The oil company?  There is 5% ownership unaccounted for after company when public last year.

2756 2018-07-11 19:25:00 Rather than talk about German dependence on Russia natural gas & oil, we should work with Germany to establish reserves & alternate sources. Always use up your adversaries resources before exhausting your own. Deplete your adversaries resources & make them economically dependent.

2762 2018-07-11 19:24:28 I wanted to like him, but his shitty word choice and ineffective metaphors made it impossible...it was like mixing oil and water (and a colloidal suspension achieved through agitation or any other means doesn’t count as mixing for this example), you know?
2763 2018-07-11 19:24:24 Of course he is. Especially now that Trump is trying to fuck Russia out of the billions of dollars that Germany purchases in oil and natural gas. Yep he is sure playing right into Putin's hand. LOL

2767 2018-07-11 19:24:12 Gov regulations restrict industry for all but the bigger players. The list is too long. Regs tell you when to sleep, when to wake, and if you're tired or not. Independent operators can hardly make a living.
2768 2018-07-11 19:24:01 Obama was a weak president, and not in the best interest of America (understatement). Would love to see Russia energy sales to EU get choked off, and reduce their ability of use energy cutoff tactics. America can now supply oil, since congress has approved, after 40yr ban.

2772 2018-07-11 19:23:58 do you have cajuput oil with you? that might help- also you can dab water on the itchy spots if they persist. but i know how it feels though ugh you can’t really sleep when they’re around;;;;

2779 2018-07-11 19:23:24 When did she start her kylie beauty products? That she’d be worth $900M. Even bastardly rich oil drilling arabs never get $900 M.
2780 2018-07-11 19:23:13 Germany is a hollow shell that gleams in the sunlight with its reconstructed buildings and unique cuisine, but the country itself stands on faulty foundations. If Russia wanted to cut off its supply of oil and gas, Germany would fall like a house of cards.

2782 2018-07-11 19:22:54 Not one year during the Obama administration did gas prices average 3.76, let alone average 3.96 over 8 years .  Google it.  Losing Iran's oil is what did it.
2783 2018-07-11 19:22:52 He added the percentage of oil and the percentage of natural gas, I’m thinking.
2784 2018-07-11 19:22:39 What else can we expect if some vegan products factories use palm oil in their products?. We the people have to boycott products containing palm oil.

2789 2018-07-11 19:22:01 Retweeted Ana Navarro (@ananavarro):

Trump tells NATO, Germany is controlled by Russia because that’s from where Germany gets its oil.
Ok, well, by that logic....
Trump is controlled by Russia because that’s from where Trump got his presidency.
2790 2018-07-11 19:22:00 Only 5 of 29 NATO nations have met their spending commitments (including the U.S.), meanwhile Putin has Germany by the balls in that they're dependent on Russia for oil.  Trump's the only sane actor in this play.
2791 2018-07-11 19:22:00 Let us also not forget that the single greatest boon to the Russian economy in years came this year when Trump pulling out of the JCPOA raised oil prices, injecting billions of dollars into the Russian economy (at the expense of American drivers).
2792 2018-07-11 19:21:51 So... Germany is under control of the Russians because they buy energy. Well then, the USA buys 41% of its oil, 3.3 million barrels, 8 billion cubic feet of natural gas & 73 megawatt hours of electricity a day from Canada. You are under our control! Bow down, energy vassals!
2793 2018-07-11 19:21:49 it fucked up my moisture barrier so now my texture is off & skin’s producing more oil, but if you’re not acne prone and don’t have sensitive skin u should be ok lol

2802 2018-07-11 19:21:02 USA imports 40% of crude oil from Canada, so it can refine and export the products.  Let's shut her down and see how bold Trump is then,  And we don't lie about it.

2804 2018-07-11 19:20:59 Fact Check: We didn’t just find this out! The US, Germany and the UK have been actively working to reduce Germany’s dependence on Russian energy. Most of Europe is a net oil and gas importer and Russian is the primary supplier.

2806 2018-07-11 19:20:54 Oh dear, you have been conned by Trump, Germany buys less than half of their gas and oil from Russia. As such this is trade as opposed to NATO oriented. Trump just can't resist telling lies, Merkel is all for NATO, Trump is trying to destroy it for his buddy Putin.
2807 2018-07-11 19:20:51 We pay NATO to protect against Russia, who then pays Russia for oil. 

Why is the US paying Russia for Europe’s oil?!

Total bullshit

2810 2018-07-11 19:20:39 I know there was oil around Blackdom so that could be the rationale behind prohibiting the drilling...but what was also custom at the turn of the 20th century was to haul water via rail that had water access issues...RR routes were typically not built in proximity to Black towns.
2811 2018-07-11 19:20:22 Uhm...he scolded them for siding with Russia on oil while we defend them from Russia.    Time for your meds.
2812 2018-07-11 19:20:21 And we do plenty of business with countries that don't like us.  We still buy oil from Saudi Arabia.  We do lots of business in China.   Hell, we were probably buying oil from Iran.
2813 2018-07-11 19:20:17 After too many drinks, Lamar Alexander insists to President Trump that Israeli politicians are drilling for oil. Trump's body double helps.

2828 2018-07-11 19:18:22 Looks like oil crashed also because of india's PM, LoL ! NaMo threatened them n opened a Chinese Bank in India as part of the Plan B strategy !
2829 2018-07-11 19:18:21 um, no.  i don't think you grasp ad hominem/tu quoque.

tesla's competition IS viable.  oil companies don't need handouts to make money.  neither do BMW, mercedes, etc.  not GM, yeah, they did.  being a US car company sucks.  it's a terrible business.  i wouldn't invest in it.
2830 2018-07-11 19:18:20 Oil & gas in Texas?  Shocking!  I get it. You’re fearful.
2831 2018-07-11 19:18:16 @ShepNewsTeam Shame on you Shep!!!!! This is the worst Newscast ever! You are just hammering Trump yet leaving so much info out! Um hes attacking Germany because THEY ARE ATTACKING US FOR "LIKING" Russia yet that's where they get all their oil! SO SHAME ON YOU BOYCOTT YOUR SHOW!
2832 2018-07-11 19:18:12 Linguine, fresh + olive oil + black pepper. Delicious.
2833 2018-07-11 19:18:12 what about your scams in essar oil, king Fisher, pnb, rotomac etc.
2834 2018-07-11 19:18:11 Nah I understand that, I just feel lik I’m not gone be a billionaire changing my oil. A billionaire still might have to change a tire .
2835 2018-07-11 19:17:57 There are a lot of people out there who will not read your entire message. The main giveaway will be it is OK to give your dog cannabis. Don’t give your dog cannabis. Or oil.
2836 2018-07-11 19:17:56 Since I use coconut oil basically everyday, I’ll be out in the sun for 15 minutes and be a whole different shade
2837 2018-07-11 19:17:55 Derek, the United States pays exhorbitantly to protect those NATO countries from the evil Russians. Yet Germany gets 70% of its natural gas from Russia and Europe overall gets 25% of its OIL AND GAS from Russia.
Is Russia an enemy or not? NATO can’t make up its mind.
2838 2018-07-11 19:17:51 Bath and Body works massage oil smells good and it better for 16.50$ lol  I got 2
2839 2018-07-11 19:17:49 @AliVelshi totally  agree Trump does’t know what he’s talking about. It’s Russia who needs the exports, of oil & gas.
2840 2018-07-11 19:17:49 But we need a pro business government first that will stand up for the oil industry, SCRAP THE CARBON TAX, repeal the oil sands emission cap, and stop the phase out of coal power in order to show investors that we're open for business!

2842 2018-07-11 19:17:25 #NATO and Germany is WRONG to rely on Russia for their oil and gas and ask us to defend Germany from Russia at the same time
2843 2018-07-11 19:17:17 Man, this ref ain't calling shit.....
2844 2018-07-11 19:17:15 He is condemning Germany for dealing with Russia and bypassing NATO for Germany’s oil supply.  Soooo, he is NOT supporting Russia.
2845 2018-07-11 19:17:13 @ShepNewsTeam YOU SUCK!! You are no better than CNN! @realDonaldTrump is absolutely correct in telling Germany they are beholden to Russia! Why do we have to protect them from Russia when they spend billions for Russian oil?! Makes no damn sense! @FoxNews needs to fire your ass!
2846 2018-07-11 19:17:10 Mr Sekulow, most of these European countries have been getting away this for years, especially Germany,  countries like Poland and Austria have been right there in paying a fair share, Spain too.  Germany, being the richest country, but need us,but buy oil from Russia?
2847 2018-07-11 19:17:10 “They cum oil”
2848 2018-07-11 19:17:03 Do you invest in oil?

2851 2018-07-11 19:16:57 The amount of disgusting caked on grease and oil debris im scraping off of this grill right now probably has to be one of the dirtiest jobs I’ve ever done
2852 2018-07-11 19:16:49 They get 9% of russian oil.

Lmao
2853 2018-07-11 19:16:48 I 100% agree and would love a completely traditional life but don’t see why a piece of paper that the state issues me would make that a reality :) I think traditional lives come from having traditional values.
2854 2018-07-11 19:16:45 With the GOP public shaming and Starbucks dropping straws, I hope the next step is publicly shaming the 90-something oil executives and industrialists that are actually directly responsible for killing our planet.

2857 2018-07-11 19:16:22 Oil stocks: Not looking to buy any oils currently bc the focus is 1st and foremost on growth stks, obviously. But I am watching these explorers should there b rotation from growth into value/cyclical as often happens in a mature bull #stocks
2858 2018-07-11 19:16:21 It’s what happens when you depend on the U.S. for your protection. Germany stop stabbing us in the back. Signing that oil and gas deal with Russia (our enemy) will make you dependent on them.

Just because it doesn’t say FOR MEN/MAN doesn’t mean you can’t -
2864 2018-07-11 19:15:56 you: humans are killing the planet     me, an intellectual: no like 100 people are killing the planet. this is about industrialists and oil execs. we literally know their names. y’all just don’t care that much.

2868 2018-07-11 19:15:42 Waiting forever for this oil change to be done
2869 2018-07-11 19:15:27 I had to get my oil changed because I was 7k miles over due and I’m suppose to get it done at 4k
2870 2018-07-11 19:15:26 Irony is you calling out germany for economic ties to Russia and ‘making Russia rich’ while you’re handing over the USA to Russia with a bow on top. (All for oil profits... how’s your deal with Putin and  Rosneft, btw?)
2871 2018-07-11 19:15:21 Zone, each other (Deleuze, LoS) Robinson is a functional as an assemblage Oil is for better environment The table is not
2872 2018-07-11 19:15:17 .@amyklobuchar .@SenTinaSmith .@RepJasonLewis - .@POTUS: “I think it’s very sad when Germany makes a massive oil and gas deal with Russia, where you’re supposed to be guarding against Russia, and Germany goes out and pays billions and billions of dollars a year to Russia.”
2873 2018-07-11 19:15:05 Did you know that we sell oils like hemp seed oil and jojoba oil, which are great for hair? We carry a selection of over 80 different essential and base oils, too! To order either call in or stop by! #oils #allnaturallove #oillove

2876 2018-07-11 19:14:51 did you know he was born and raised on an offshore oil rig, as part of an effort by FIFA to create truly neutral referees
2877 2018-07-11 19:14:51 Changing oil isn’t a emergency, you don’t break down cause of yo oil then have to change it on the side of the road and you good, lol nah but tire? Yea.
2878 2018-07-11 19:14:44 The oil industry ruined thousands of square miles of louisiana marsh by cutting channels all through it.  The miss gulf outlet destroyed an immense area.  That alone raised storm surges several critical feet.  It will get much worse.  The gentle slope of the gulf. . .
2879 2018-07-11 19:14:43 One thing strikes me. If these ppl are so afraid of LE then why not walk away? Avoiding contact would be logical response,  not confrontation. Much of this is contrived to push an anti LE narrative
2880 2018-07-11 19:14:39 Because that's how energy works. We were buying oil from Iraq up until the day before we invaded.

2882 2018-07-11 19:14:36 @ShepNewsTeam why don't you go to CNN! You made my blood boil cracking on @POTUS . @POTUS is absolutely right! Germany needs to buy our oil not Russia's!! We are in Germany because they tried to take over the World! Same as Japan! You flamin' lib! Go elsewhere!!!!
2883 2018-07-11 19:14:29 Can’t believe I’ve only just discovered that baby oil trick to get fake tan off when I’ve been struggling with the chore of nearly taking all my skin off weekly doing the new fake tan routine for the past 5 years
2884 2018-07-11 19:14:18 SS isn’t Trump insinuating that Germany could be controlled by Russia if they want to cut off Germany’s oil supplies. Not that they aren’t an ally. Germany is leaving themselves venerable to Russian demands. If push came to shove.
2885 2018-07-11 19:14:06 Ha ha! Will see you next time I am in town.
2886 2018-07-11 19:13:52 tough day to be an #oil investor...reminds me of the line..."well, other than THAT Ms. Lincoln, how was the play?"

2888 2018-07-11 19:13:40 It is like how we pay the Saudi’s for oil when the 9/11 terrorist attack was committed almost exclusively by Saudi citizens.
2889 2018-07-11 19:13:38 $82.51 for an oil change I’m sick
2890 2018-07-11 19:13:37 @ShepNewsTeam This monologue today is terrible!  Why shouldn't Germany buy natural gas and oil from USA instead of Russia? We pay more than all these countries for NATO yet they go to Russia for natural gas? Makes NO sense.
2891 2018-07-11 19:13:33 I have no shame in asking another man for his skin/beard care routine. If Dennis’ banana fluff cremé beard oil is gonna make my beard and face nice, then fuck yes sign me up 
2892 2018-07-11 19:13:23 WW1 - US participation 2½ years after start of war.

Korea - A war kept alive and Lost by US.
Vietnam - Total loss for US

2894 2018-07-11 19:13:16 I would fight the trade war on high-end technology, because that's vital to our future, but lower skill industries is probably gone for good and I would not fight for that. I agree with you we need to innovate the next fuel source for post oil and other new technologies.

2896 2018-07-11 19:13:14 Good news.  Biofuel mandates tie grain crop prices to world oil prices.  Horrible consequences.   May have triggered the Arab Spring via bread price jump in Egypt.

2900 2018-07-11 19:12:58 @ShepNewsTeam NATO is outdated..  Russia is not the problem they are weak and insolvent. Europe gets their oil,gas and energy from Russia. Shep your job is to report the news not analyze in your opinion.
2901 2018-07-11 19:12:43 Boat
2902 2018-07-11 19:12:34 @ShepNewsTeam keep believing that NATO is purely good while they bend us over every year, and Putin is purely bad while these NATO countries buy their oil from Russia. You've shown for over 2 years you are a part of the #AntiTrumpDeepState

2906 2018-07-11 19:12:12 Mkts can and will do whatever, but given the rout in oil, copper and the rally in the dollar, seriously you want to be long stocks?
2907 2018-07-11 19:12:11 So, why didn’t the dealmaker in Chief make a better deal to sell our oil and gas?
2908 2018-07-11 19:12:10 @mitchellreports , Many would believe that threatening Russia's oil trade would hurt Russia/Putin.  

Serious question:  Is there anything that President Trump can say in which the response from you and your ilk would be "Putin loses"?

2911 2018-07-11 19:12:01 I asked how socialism destroyed the country. This video is just "Venezuela is bad and its socialism's fault" with no elaboration not even a mention of oil that their economy hinges on just like the other right wing propaganda that I found when googling my question
2912 2018-07-11 19:11:55 With oil price down by almost $4 per barrel today, Americans will be paying less at the pump in the near future.  Surprised MarketWatch is not tweeting about this good news for consumers!

2917 2018-07-11 19:10:27 Drink more tap water...
which means respect our water. Everyone needs a clean, #potable water source before they need to move oil across the country in an efficient, cost-effective manner. Less bottles, more glasses (in a nutshell). And stop adding #fluoride to city water!

2920 2018-07-11 19:10:13 No sharon, the fear or idea was that world war 3 would occur in German, hence why we have bases there etc.  if the Germans are giving Russians billions in oil why would Russia be a threat to Germany?  It our seem merkel might be in Putin’s pocket since he is benefiting from .
2921 2018-07-11 19:10:11 Not at all.  Just register as a Republican.

2924 2018-07-11 19:10:06 Because Germany simply doesn't _depend_ on Russian oil/gas. 
2925 2018-07-11 19:10:06 Germany and most of the EU beat up on our President about trying to get along with Russia, and meanwhile, they buy oil and gas via direct pipeline with Russia.

2927 2018-07-11 19:09:59 1) all countries need to wean off oil 2) Canada emits far far more per capita 3) You're saying that instead of trying to improve where we live and where we have political voice, we should instead go to another country and protest?.. That doesn't make sense or seem effective, Gail

2930 2018-07-11 19:09:56 Maybe Trump thinks Germany should get their oil the American way... by invading.
2931 2018-07-11 19:09:31 No! Absolutely not, he setting this up so able to drop the sanctions &Exxon can drill in the Arctic. A huge setup to be able to drop the sanctions. If RU’s getting gas and oil from there (a small percentage actually, DE a large green nrg producer). ‘If you can do it, so can we’
2932 2018-07-11 19:09:30 As is oil. Still is.
2933 2018-07-11 19:09:26 Hey Shepherd! Stop dissing my president @FoxNews especially while he is abroad. Germany is making under the table deals with Russia to buy oil. I stand with @POTUS
2934 2018-07-11 19:09:23 Oil stocks not taking the bait.
2935 2018-07-11 19:09:18 Complaining about NATO is a standard operating procedure by 
US presidents.... 
On the other hand buying oil and gas from a country that you needs protections from might not be a good idea..

2941 2018-07-11 19:08:42 Shepard Smith on Fox shows his hatred for @POTUS all the time. Our President is telling it like it is. Why Germany at 1-1/2 GDP. And spending billions in Russia for pipeline. We export oil gas .we pay to use hospital there. Germany and EU stab us with tariffs.Turned Fox off til 3
2942 2018-07-11 19:08:39 It’s very fucking odd to hear free market capitalists tell another county where they should/shouldn’t buy oil.
2943 2018-07-11 19:08:38 I agree Trump is right on trade and on NATO/not buying Russian oil, but he needs to approach these folks behind closed doors first and then go public in a more tactful way if that doesn't work.
2944 2018-07-11 19:08:30 @ShepNewsTeam yes Shep Germany has the oil deal with Russia while we pay the lions share of the NATO bill. No more go along to get along. Is the 3 o’clock hour news or opinion?
2945 2018-07-11 19:08:24 Just add boiled water on indomie inside small container and cover it for 10mins then add your oil and seasoning

2947 2018-07-11 19:08:18 "Germany is totally controlled by Russia, because they will be getting 60-70 percent of their energy from Russia and a new pipeline" this all energy including oil, not just gas. I don't know how you could interpret otherwise.
2948 2018-07-11 19:08:13 ExxonMobil (an American oil company) operates the Sakhalin project drilling for oil and gas in East Russia.
The total project is estimated to cost US$10–12 billion, making it the largest direct investment in Russia from foreign sources.
Just saying.
2949 2018-07-11 19:08:11 . I mean its very possible that we may have took a lot of oil to supply our army and most likely did because it hurts them as well just as we would take any of their other supplies but I dont think we still do that unless its from a terrorist base. Why would you kill actors?

2954 2018-07-11 19:07:40 *He pulled down a jar of popping corn, and a bottle of cooking oil, pointing to the logos at the top of either* These are companies. They make money by making and selling things. In this case, vegetable oil, and popping corn. Anything bought has a company selling it.
2955 2018-07-11 19:07:37 You are absolutely correct. there is no good governance  there is only a government with pot holes - oil companies will suck the people with excise on fuel PSU bank will have more and more NPAs with the help of insiders with Government nod and   fugitives  flying to Swiss banks
2956 2018-07-11 19:07:24 maybe so.... though it's not oil its nat gas....
and may be a battle for gas exports..... ie  our LNG exports when we have so much gas coming off the ( prolific) oil wells here in TX and the gas wells in the Marcellus.
2957 2018-07-11 19:07:23 I did last night and I woke up ugly lmao I'm gonna put more on today and some Neen and Tamanu oil
2958 2018-07-11 19:07:23 thats fine but we share military expenses and WE SHARE oil and commercial plunders with USA and GB after the wars
2959 2018-07-11 19:07:17 We diversify. America is one of the world's largest oil producers, and close to 40 percent of U.S. oil needs are met at home. Most of the imports currently come from five countries: Canada, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Venezuela and Nigeria.
2960 2018-07-11 19:07:16 Trump: Germany gets their oil from Russia, so Russia controls Germany!

Says the leader of the country that has occupied Germany since WWII and gets their oil from Saudi Arabia
#NATOSummit2018 #NATO
2961 2018-07-11 19:07:10 Not true. One would dress up as a ninja in Chicago and scare the hell out of people pointing an MP5 at them. Fairly certain he lost his job
2962 2018-07-11 19:07:07 i have no idea if itll work on walls, but dish soap usually works on misc oil stains
2963 2018-07-11 19:07:06 Coconut oil
2964 2018-07-11 19:07:05 Yes because cutting off their oil customers is totally in Putins pocket.
2965 2018-07-11 19:06:40 Merkel s Germany give $2billion to Russia every year for oil and natural gas,  who are you kidding.

2980 2018-07-11 19:05:22 EPA estimates 1.2% leakage of gross natural gas production. The recent Science study put natural gas system emissions closer to 1.7-1.8%. (They only published the natural gas plus oil number.)  Still quite low!  And the errors overlap (or close) to EPA's.
2981 2018-07-11 19:05:17 And Germany needs to stop enriching Russia with oil revenue!! Russia, you know, that country that invaded two countries in recent years!!
2982 2018-07-11 19:05:12 @Hatspin I remember the chemist once made me a 'poultice' of salicylic acid and linseed oil, for my verruca. Do they still do that, do you know?
Can I make my own with aspirin?
2983 2018-07-11 19:05:08 Something is def. wrong here. Looks like Slick Jimmy AKA Slim Jim AKA Jimmy Lube AKA Handy J AKA jerk em Jim AKA jock Strap Jim might need an oil check..get it "checking oil" maybe he can go be a member of parliament in Grease (Ancient Greece to be exact)
2984 2018-07-11 19:04:51 I’d like to think that in our vast wonderful country, we can have all those things. People fell for an ignorant snake oil salesman. Cutting regulations is easy. Cutting taxes is easy. Wait until the fallout. He is incompetent.
2985 2018-07-11 19:04:50 What,.... do you have heavy investments in oil or something?   A little research by the good Doctor would show that this is false propaganda.
2986 2018-07-11 19:04:49 Oil have another!

2988 2018-07-11 19:04:35 “Yeah- I need.. Parker Alexandra Trager.” The brunette hissed and flipped the five year old over her shoulder to hold her in place. “I need an oil change and maybe a tire rotation... is anyone available?” She asked as the five year old wiggled more. 

“So help me god Parks.” +
2989 2018-07-11 19:04:31 @ShepNewsTeam The rest of the world has to pay their fair share for NATO. Germany is allowing Russia to sell them oil. In the meantime, they are not paying even 2% GDP while we are paying 4%. You slam Trump every day. You are a disgrace.
2990 2018-07-11 19:04:29 Using this simple life hack you too can get your very own grill, just subscribe to btgg. Com and buy our unique oil blend
2991 2018-07-11 19:04:25 Are you sure the Bush Dynasty wants out of NATO?   Bush Dynasty wants to sell Europe gas and oil.  That is what Trump is up to.  Our Senators had spoke to Russian F. M.  I like to see us out too.  Threat EU Army. Bush Dynasty taken over.  Ukraine, Poland, oil, gas.
2992 2018-07-11 19:04:24 #MSNBC Another big lie by #Thug45 Germany gets 20% of its energy from oil/gas of that 20% only 40% comes from Russia!  He has no math skills and is spatially challenged!
2993 2018-07-11 19:04:16 Great call Adam.  Very nice moves on $DWT and $DRIP today.  Are you expecting more downside?  I believe we are heading into a weaker seasonal period for oil.
2994 2018-07-11 19:04:10 Hydro has a very low tolerance for safety infractions as do any of the companies I’ve worked for in the oil patch. Red intended to make sure that nobody fails to get that message given the number of actual incidence and their severity this would realistically be green-amber

Guys, I love cuddles 
2998 2018-07-11 19:03:48 At least Germany is getting oil from Russia what do we get for the billions to Israhell...NOTHING..but stolen tech. AND attacked 911 & USS LIBERTY... all theater all the time
2999 2018-07-11 19:03:43 He'd berate Germany for getting there gas/oil from Russia??

3002 2018-07-11 19:03:20 Can you explain why Germany is giving Iran cash or working with Russia on an oil pipeline, while still criticizing Trump on his meeting with Putin? If he gets an "iron clad" agreement would you believe it or him? Not likely. He won't abandon NATO
3003 2018-07-11 19:03:16 Just reminding you that we buy oil - and borrow large, large sums of money - from our enemies.
3004 2018-07-11 19:03:16 To be covered in oil, I mean.
3005 2018-07-11 19:03:02 Corn, wine, and oil; and, from the herd or flock,
3006 2018-07-11 19:02:54 lol, so your not an oil expert just an oil monitor?
3007 2018-07-11 19:02:52 we have been fighting a proxy war with Russia in Syria the past decade so Putin, Assad & Iran cant finish building a pipeline to the MED that would severely cut off Israels control of Oil & Gas in that region!
3008 2018-07-11 19:02:34 And thank you. I am a Bride of Christ and my oil lamp is full. Came with a refill bottle also
3009 2018-07-11 19:02:16 @RedlerAllAccess interesting strength in very specific names $AMZN, $HUYA, $IWM is much lower than yday's low. If oil weren't getting crushed, we would be down very small
3010 2018-07-11 19:02:09 The Fake News Media is calling President Trump a "Russian Agent" while he is at the NATO Summit telling world leaders NOT to buy oil and gas from Russia.

President Trump has literally done NOTHING to help Russia. Everything he does puts AMERICA FIRST.

Democrats are delusional!

3013 2018-07-11 19:01:42 Won’t happen. It’s a world market demand just like for oil. Let’s wait and see.
3014 2018-07-11 19:01:36 Holy shit bro it's almost like this whole thread is about cbd oil and nobody said anything about marijuana until you did just now. Congrats.

3017 2018-07-11 19:01:30 all sounds pretty fab to me! no oil, but think I may get some tomorrow. ditto the ice cream! 
3018 2018-07-11 19:01:25 You obviously do not understand how NATO works or that Germany's energy source and contract is separate from it. It is no different than US's oil from Iran.

And the deal was signed back then by Gerhard Schröder who was Chancellor at the time and very friendly towards Russia, is a personal friend of Putin and currently is chairman of Rosneft, Russias oil company.
3021 2018-07-11 19:01:08 Wait doesnt that mean the US is controlled by the Middle East because thats where we get our oil from?
3022 2018-07-11 19:01:04 Praised Putin?  Is that why he told Nato to stop buying russian oil?
3023 2018-07-11 19:01:00 Yeah if germany is totally controlled by russia then no need to invite russia into the g7 and russia is then really in NATO. Oh are we totally controlled by OPEC because we have foreign oil dependencies?Trump projecting - HE is totally controlled by Russia!

3041 2018-07-11 19:00:04 Yeah, that's why Trump is speaking out against Putin and attacking Germany for buying so much Russian oil and supporting a Russian pipeline. Uh huh.

I did cut myself and only found out this morning when I reached into a jug of 95% alcohol and lemon oil. It was less than fun, but at least it wasn't bloody.
3045 2018-07-11 18:59:32 If Germany is afraid of Russia, then they shouldn't support Russia's economy by buying their oil. If Germany is not afraid of Russia, then it's fine. Trump is calling out the doublespeak of people saying he is beholden to Russia while they are supporting a quarter of Russia's GDP

3058 2018-07-11 18:58:35 Umm last I checked the energy sector is pretty globalized...oil is especially difficult as you need a blend from different sources...this is like asking why we import oil from venezula

3075 2018-07-11 18:57:02 Salmond based his whole separatist case on an abnormally high price for oil - not one that anything me else predicted. He is a chancer and a gambler. He bet the farm on a false prospectus.

3084 2018-07-11 18:56:31 It doesn’t really matter who Putin sells oil or gas to so long as Trump creates uncertainty in the market an prices go up. There is a more than willing buyer in China who will likely buy more from Russia as a result of trade tensions with the US.

3089 2018-07-11 18:56:19 Also for oil Corp, try and get all errands done one day a week so you have less fill ups in car
3090 2018-07-11 18:56:18 (1) Population size was only part of my original comment, IIRC. The other was Norway's extremely high level of reliance on oil/gas for GDP (20%) and exports (50%). The article concedes that this can have an effect on the economics stats.
3091 2018-07-11 18:56:04 Moreover-- I would certainly consider the oil subsidies and warfare cronyism that props up oil and other heavy-lobbied industry profits. Spport for EVs is in the interest of citizen's health, climate, and countries' self-sufficiency, which is very much the gov'ts role & mission
3092 2018-07-11 18:56:03 そろそろ寝るか
3093 2018-07-11 18:55:59 oil & airlines (transports) getting smoked is interesting i think... very surprised the market as a whole yawns... (I yawn with for now). a few hedges on.
3094 2018-07-11 18:55:56 Solar is the basis of all energy. Where do you think oil comes from? Wood? Gas? It's all stored solar energy. The core of the Earth is a nickel-iron dynamo interacting with the Sun's magnetic field: as we orbit, it rotates like a magnetic rotor, generating friction and heat.
3095 2018-07-11 18:55:51 its an oil change bro, what are you even typing back there...
3096 2018-07-11 18:55:48 Its got nothing to do with oil reserves, but oil revenues. Do you beleive Norway would have a $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund if it we part of the UK.
3097 2018-07-11 18:55:48 They can keep their 'ambition.'

Meanwhile, we'll use our dirty oil money and win the trophies and glory. C'mon City.
3098 2018-07-11 18:55:37 I agree clean energy is progress & that we should (& I believe we are!) try to move to the next source of energy. But panic about Peak Oil is an eye roll for me. They’ve been saying it for almost 70 years. They will be right eventually, but when? Like I said, they’ve cried wolf.

3101 2018-07-11 18:55:32 It’s no good mining a whale ! Everyone knows that whales don’t have coal in them. Mine in Huntly where the coal is ! Leave the whale for sewing machine oil.
3102 2018-07-11 18:55:28 So ur sinuses are painful huh? Well Dr Molly prescribes olbus oil bubble bath, antibiotics, a good binge watch if ur all time favourite shows & most importantly ice cream!
3103 2018-07-11 18:55:24 See I still dont think oil was really a part of this at all because we create plenty of our own but I can get behind you that its very possible 9/11 was some sort of ruse to get into the middle east. I can also agree that Israel is no true friend of ours and has ulterior motives.
3104 2018-07-11 18:55:24 Guess USA is totally dependent on OPEC. Owned by OPEC. Trump you are owned. What a dum dum we have as president. Yep Germany uses a pipeline from Russia - so they arent an independent country. We have alot of reliance on foreign oil ourselves!
3105 2018-07-11 18:55:23 Frickin Oil could have given that contract
3106 2018-07-11 18:55:20 there are two seasons in LA: liquid coconut oil & solid coconut oil
3107 2018-07-11 18:55:13 Yes. But I'm suspecting that oil filter. Popsie ordered some parts from abroad in 2014. So he bought many spare stuff. The oil filter there now has been in our store since then
3108 2018-07-11 18:55:11 If olive oil is made out of olives, then baby oil is....... lock the doors.
3109 2018-07-11 18:55:07 So the Russian agent is telling NATO not to buy oil from Russia.....something is seriously wrong here
3110 2018-07-11 18:55:06 Some people legit don’t know anything about the cars they drive. Like it’s very bad. I remember a joke on here about a guy whose wife thought the OIL cap was rather  710
3111 2018-07-11 18:54:54 What's your favorite essential oil?
3112 2018-07-11 18:54:52 Direct pipeline oil and gas from Russia to Germany..of course middle would sell oil to anyone.. but, Germany buys from Russia
3113 2018-07-11 18:54:50 Oil dey your head.
3114 2018-07-11 18:54:50 Dude, I even owe you a favor. Want some argan oil? (Though I won't be able to send it/mail it until October.)
3115 2018-07-11 18:54:49 Start them Off On Johnson and Johnson’s in the Hospitals and Continue it Fa Life. Trust me no Problems what so ever after thatand if Any Soap Dove or Dry Skin They hav Johnson’s Baby oil Gel mix it with the Lotion and Ur Great! Kids and Adults
3116 2018-07-11 18:54:46 You didn’t clarify - cleaning inside or outside?
3117 2018-07-11 18:54:31 Lol go and buy miwas oil.
3118 2018-07-11 18:54:19 Je suis dans la politique depuis 30 ans, à observer le prisme politique. J ai rencontré du monde, et lunque des livres sur le cnr. Le peak oil et le climat sont au dessus de toute priorité. Les articles sont pour les technocrates.
3119 2018-07-11 18:54:14 Better pay for Russian gas and oil than to pay to Saudi Arabia - and by the way building a pipeline doesn’t mean necessarily that we buy all oil and gas there. It’s called diversity to get more than one source to be independent.
3120 2018-07-11 18:54:10 Before I read it..3x a day -applied moist hot washcloth.   And if you really want to “go for it” add a little organic unrefined coconut oil afterward. 
3121 2018-07-11 18:54:10 I don't know what troll means. SPX/oil correlation all over the place. Crude is an input cost/tax to many companies and almost all individuals so lower prices help economy in many ways. Also: Depends why crude going lower - supply or demand.
3122 2018-07-11 18:54:00 LOOOOOOOL I love bald men  not every brush his waves 

Sometimes oil his head
3123 2018-07-11 18:53:55 I must admit I would laugh out loud if the repubes tuned around and leased that land to the oil and mineral people.
3124 2018-07-11 18:53:51 Burning some camphor oil.... eating a peach, drinking water.... took my vitamins. Just being a wholesome individual today.
3125 2018-07-11 18:53:50 those were the days ... massive open air pool near the stone jetty. Olive oil as sun tan lotion!
3126 2018-07-11 18:53:45 seeing people interact with my bot like the oil meme
3127 2018-07-11 18:53:38 If Germany is owned by Russia because of pipeline what does that say about US and its reliance on Middle East for oil?
3128 2018-07-11 18:53:38 the US also imports OIL from Canada. Making the US captive to Canada.
3129 2018-07-11 18:53:37 Omg what was the name of the peppermint oil u let me use!!
3130 2018-07-11 18:53:32 The American embargo on oil is all I can really remember. They couldn't fuel anything without our oil exports.
3131 2018-07-11 18:53:26 Your general hypocracy aside, oil subisidies are appropriately on-point as oil/ICE interests are a direct and alternative competitor to TSLA.  You cannot condemn market viability/profitability of Tesla business due to cronyism without considering the same of its competitors.
3132 2018-07-11 18:53:25 I cut them in half added olive oil & fresh garlic then roasted in pan on grill.  Added grated Parmesan at end #delicious

3134 2018-07-11 18:53:25 I POTUS for calling out NATO countries not paying their fair share and especially Germany for buying Russian oil. It's about time we had  President who wasn't afraid to do his job while leading the greatest country in the world.
3135 2018-07-11 18:53:17 roads get sand/oil on them and this happens. too dangerous!
3136 2018-07-11 18:53:17 So glad you and ObamaCare are out of office. 

Trump is correct.  NATO countries should pay their fare share.  Why are we protecting NATO countries from Russia while NATO countries buy oil from Russia, thus enriching Russia?

3137 2018-07-11 18:53:01 And they are making themselves dependent on Putin’s oil!
3138 2018-07-11 18:53:00 The crab dialog again ? It always makes me hungry for Blue Shell...I love Democrats - sauteed with a little olive oil
3139 2018-07-11 18:52:57 I know  I also found coconut oil is a perfect replacement for butter in almost everything.
3140 2018-07-11 18:52:57 So if Germany consents to purchase oil from USA instead of Russia, allowing you to justify turning over more of our Private and Public Lands to the pollution and destruction of US BigOil interests, we can be friends?
3141 2018-07-11 18:52:55 Is that like fish oil? I'm down to add that to my list.
3142 2018-07-11 18:52:55 The best thing that can happen to Nigeria is for Niger Delta to dry up. In fact, crude oil in every part of Nigeria to dry up.

Nigeria will sit up that day. Everything that has looked impossible before will happen over night. Restructuring, state police, etc.
3143 2018-07-11 18:52:55 After doing the engine flush, did the mechanic change the oil filter?
3144 2018-07-11 18:52:54 Some guys just yelled out to me "Hey Old Lady!" I didn't realize that the podcast about fish oil supplements I was listening to was on blast.
3145 2018-07-11 18:52:51 Oho, he understands it. He wants Germany to by US oil and US gas. That's all.
3146 2018-07-11 18:52:43 You tweeted a few days ago your anger at OPEC for not pumping enough oil resulting in high prices. Where do you suggest they get their oil from?
3147 2018-07-11 18:52:43 Nigeria Independence is just like Spdc and the indigenous oil companies.

3153 2018-07-11 18:52:18 this isn't just on Lybia. Is oil the last shoe to fall. Changes happened in equities, QE t oQT, bonds, yields, inflation and now maybe oil? The move today is s radical and surprising as USD/JYP move was.
3154 2018-07-11 18:52:16 @realDonaldTrump can be seen as Putin's lobbyist to dismantle NATO and/or shilling for American Oil companies, so far @realDonaldTrump will be the Best asset yet for Putin!
3155 2018-07-11 18:52:15 He’s talking about natural gas. Not oil.
3156 2018-07-11 18:52:15 What I didn't need today was to be bombarded with military returning home videos while waiting at the mechanic for an oil change. Please tears stay in my eyes!

3161 2018-07-11 18:51:46 I can't wait for the part when trump mentions that the US buys oil from Russia and has a 10 billion dollar trade deficit with Russia while being a NATO member too!  May be awhile... think I'll light my cigar now instead.
3162 2018-07-11 18:51:45 Are you sniffing glue? He called out NATOs BS. He called out Merkel for making a secret natural gas oil pipeline deal with Putin. All but 4 European countries get their NG from Russia or via Ukraine. Who is owned by Russia?
3163 2018-07-11 18:51:45 Oil basically trying to weigh the shock to global demand from US trade policy vs. the shock to to global supply from US sanctions policy. 

That the oil market actually needs to do this may mean something for other markets.
3164 2018-07-11 18:51:38 Thanks  Dark n Lovely Au Naturale Range, then in a container I mix coconut oil, castor oil and amla oil.
3165 2018-07-11 18:51:34 Look, if Canada said "no more oil for the US ", the US army would just invade and restore the oil streams. If Russia said the same to Germany, Germany will just bow and head to recession

3181 2018-07-11 18:50:03 If this were a movie, secret ninjas would already have dotard fucktard in a vat of boiling oil, turtleman would be mounted on a wall, and spineless would be swimming in his own vomitorium. Sadly, real life isnt pushing for the good guys.
3182 2018-07-11 18:49:52 Exactly. Winters are cold in Germany. Coal, nuclear power or oil from SA aren't good choices either.

3188 2018-07-11 18:49:24 All these countries were not allocating the prescribed percentages on your watch so you scolding anyone is pretty funny. As for Germany buying russian oil, you should have been calling them them out on that as well
3189 2018-07-11 18:49:17 He jumped on Germany this morning because their in bed with Russia on oil. The US has maintained sanctions on Russia that were enacted by Obama and bolstered in the last 1 1/2 years. And yet the talking heads ignorant this and claim the President is Putin's pal. Come on!
3190 2018-07-11 18:49:11 No it does not John.
He’s doing it to put Germany on the spot, not Russia.
He knows the US can’t possibly sell its oil and gas at a lesser price to Germany (you do know how far from Germany the US is, yes?), than Russia can.
So why would the Germans pay more?

3194 2018-07-11 18:49:06 As a matter of common sense, it is not in Germany's or NATO's best interest for Germany to be so heavily reliant on Russia for oil/gas.  If Russia agression against Europe occurs, it will be difficult for Germany to take a hard stand against Russia if Russia can withold oil/gas.
3195 2018-07-11 18:49:04 SELL OFF! Despite a huge 12.6 million barrel decline, WTI crude oil posts nearly $4/bbl drop, Brent plummets $5.40/bbl! Wholesale #gasprices drop 10-13c/gal. Wow.
3196 2018-07-11 18:49:04 I Wrote a long response but I deleted it because I refuse to plunge myself into a loop of ignorant conversation. But, I'll say this. Under no circumstances should an officer, bestowed with the responsibility of protection, threaten to kill a citizen.
3197 2018-07-11 18:49:00 Feel free to pretend & fantasize that Germany and Russia in 2018 is exactly the same situation as the Arab Oil Embargo of the 70's.
3198 2018-07-11 18:49:00 Yes they use olive oil
3199 2018-07-11 18:48:56 Yes. It goes off as normal. Then comes on after 10mins of the engine on.

           for gas and oil.

3205 2018-07-11 18:48:32 TX-News 2018-07-11 02:36:47 : Crude oil hit a low as of settlement of $70.02 .. Settles @$70.38
3206 2018-07-11 18:48:17 It's so important that only a handful of countries fund their obligations to it.

It's so important that one member, and probably others, rely on the supposed greatest enemy of the alliance for oil and NG, funding that enemy and not the required NATO obligation. 

Logic please
3207 2018-07-11 18:48:14 It's soy-free so shows the ignorance of the commenter harassing you. Potato starch, coconut oil, yellow peas, mung beans and rice are the key ingredients. Beet, apple, pomegranate derivatives too but as flavouring.

3219 2018-07-11 18:47:26 I'm honestly ashamed of how some people are acting about Trump calling out Germany for buying a ton of Russian oil. If Trump is Putin's puppet, then why is he becoming outspoken against Putin and discouraging Germany from buying from Russia?! It doesn't make any sense!
3220 2018-07-11 18:47:26 Not your business what Germany pays for energy sources. 
Crude oil makes up most U.S. energy imports from Canada, averaging 3.3 million barrels/day in 2016. Canada is by far the largest source of U.S. crude oil imports, providing 41% of total U.S. crude oil imports in 2016.
3221 2018-07-11 18:47:17 เป็นไยยยย
3222 2018-07-11 18:47:15 no, no point, Saudi imports were only 10% of the US oil imports. Canada about 40%

no relevant
3223 2018-07-11 18:47:14 Trump’s view could be good for the US. That logic would mean the US is controlled by Canada because we import more oil from Canada than any other country! 
3224 2018-07-11 18:47:12 When the revenues are going to London and not Edinburgh what else would I call it but theft? The oil is Scotland's
3225 2018-07-11 18:47:09 “When Germany is dependent on Russia  for oil, it gives Russia unwavering power over Germany. While we pay huge money to the UN to protect Germany from Russia. Makes no sense.”

3226 2018-07-11 18:47:00 I brought my car to get an oil change. They turned my car on and it picked up my Bluetooth with Criminal blasting! 
3227 2018-07-11 18:46:53 $NQ_F never made a new low today & benefitting from lower Interest Rates… Weak Oil has kept extra pressure on $ES_F.
3228 2018-07-11 18:46:50 im so fricken extra i swear i still get emotional thinkin about the oil spill a couple years ago and all the animals that got affected by it and all the animals we couldnt save :/
3229 2018-07-11 18:46:47 As for the oil deal, Russia's oil companies are state owned so they will take the profit to fund their military, which is not in Germany's or NATO's interest. By the way, I am not a Trumper, I voted for Gary Johnson. You have blind rage. Think, don't repeat what media tells you.
3230 2018-07-11 18:46:47 Someone mentioned argan oil. Deciem has a nice one for ~$10.
3231 2018-07-11 18:46:38 -Get it trimmed regularly to get rid of split ends
-Invest in an oil to use on your hair regularly
-Don't use heat whenever possible, and always use heat protection
-Don't wash it everyday, try washing it 2x a week
-Don't over brush your hair,  and start bottom up to avoid damge
3232 2018-07-11 18:46:24 Why didn't you talk about Obama overpowering and illegally using the EPA for his person agenda?
Illegal CPP, More superfund sites, Flint water, Biggest oil spill in history and botched response, losing Billions of dollars on "green energy" and over 4000 new regulations in 8 years
3233 2018-07-11 18:46:19 I went to Jiffy Lube for an oil change and they tried to tell me all these things I "needed" - called my dad right up and he said "I can do all that just get the oil change."
3234 2018-07-11 18:46:18 Stand up against this snake oil salesman president. The jig is up!! He’s walking the Russian line man. I love you rosanne. Join the ranks of Jim Hightower, Ralph Nader, Ian Masters, Robert Bayer, Thomas Frank, David Cay Johnson, David Faris. Stand on the right side of history!!!!
3235 2018-07-11 18:46:15 Trump wants to remove the  sanctions that Obama placed on Russia goes to NATO and complains to our allies about making Russia richer from an oil deal with Germany. No one in the room thinks he is serious. Sadly, they likely see him as a fool.
3236 2018-07-11 18:46:13 Dude yes. Fish oil is an absolute game changer
3237 2018-07-11 18:46:11 Those are not always accurate. I would not be induced unless medically necessary. It can lead to other interventions. Try evening primrose oil, walk on the curb and bounce on a yoga ball! 
3238 2018-07-11 18:46:10 And what are we paying OPEC? So what if Germany gets their oil from Russia? Are you mad because they beat you to it??
3239 2018-07-11 18:46:06 Cbd oil is legal cross country. Marijuana is not. Gotta get the concentrated oil and dab some inside your lip
3240 2018-07-11 18:46:00 Maybe, but I also like to smoke so I don’t mean car oil haha
3241 2018-07-11 18:45:57 Studio guest Justice Uhuegbu argues that there are so many things that the government can use this money for: a clear example being to subsidise the oil & gas sector.
3242 2018-07-11 18:45:52 I love watching cooking on high.  Cannot wait to get some cannabis butter and oil.
3243 2018-07-11 18:45:48 Oh yea i forgot they make those. I used to help my mom in the kitchen when i was a wee boy. So i got used to using the big ol noodles. Her tip was to use a crap load of oil to keep them from sticking. I could totally understand not knowing the expansion rate of the no bake.
3244 2018-07-11 18:45:47 LOW OIL > LOW BREAKEVEN > LESS NEED FOR FED TO HIKE  > HIGHER NASDAQ
3245 2018-07-11 18:45:44 Oil not necessary? Lmfao so u gone let yo engine start smokin
3246 2018-07-11 18:45:28 Please also not forget we buy good and cheaper Oil from Iran, which is a very honest Partnee to deal with, contrary to the USA under Trump. Commitment on 2% is not valid anyway, Europe shall step out of it.
3247 2018-07-11 18:45:22 I use WIX oil and fuel filters on my race car and my personal vehicles
3248 2018-07-11 18:45:20 Somebody might want to look into Russia owning a good portion of EU energy, oil flow, allegedly @realDonaldTrump
3249 2018-07-11 18:44:48 Same reason we buy all our oil and gas from terrorist supporting middle eastern countries. No much other choice
3250 2018-07-11 18:44:48 Minnesota gets its oil from Canada 
3251 2018-07-11 18:44:38 Nonsense.  A drop in supply in the single digits can cripple an economy.  Look up the Arab Oil Embargo of the 70's  Gas lines stretched for blocks and the government printed up ration coupons.
3252 2018-07-11 18:44:35 Oil had a good inventory report but washed out.. probably became too crowded
3253 2018-07-11 18:44:32 1. Castor oil for eyelashes
2. Olive and Castor oil blend
3. Petroleum jelly
4. lemon peels soaked in Castor or olive oil
5. green tea
6. Shea butter for eyelashes
7. Vitamin E for eyelashes
8. Eyelash growth Serum
9. Biotin for eyelashes
3254 2018-07-11 18:44:28 Levels matter, but context is important. Market broke on a liquidation break off a poor high & being ascribed to known news. Oil is keeping pressure on as well. BUT a lot of the damage was already down in ON. Many shorts chased at bad prices & not being rewarded right away. 1/2
3255 2018-07-11 18:44:23 I’m gassing out my pimples with tea tree oil and I accidentally put some on my lip and now my lip is numb yikes
3256 2018-07-11 18:44:14 is anyone seeing this gift on #oil? unreal, what a bargain if this is a new 80 day cycle (at the least).

3259 2018-07-11 18:44:01 JOJOBA OIL 
US. HOHOBOY
3260 2018-07-11 18:44:01 I agree. All of it was easy. Except for that bullshit boss in Oil Ocean Zone act 2. That one was tough.
3261 2018-07-11 18:43:58 No don’t use dish soap. Use tea tree oil. I buy the small bottle from Trader Joe’s. Bathe them with hot water and the oil and then apply a small amount of the oil on their coats after the bath. That should work.
3262 2018-07-11 18:43:43 We have tons of oil. The government leases oil companies (US ones) the rights to drill and they decide not to so as drive up the price. Ask the oil executives Trump has hired into his administration. lolol. Do you understand the basics of what you are arguing?
3263 2018-07-11 18:43:33 Liberals: Trump is in bed with Russia! Also Liberals: Trump is an idiot for trying to undermine Russia’s biggest energy coup ever! Also also Liberals: No Fracking. We wouldn’t want to export oil and gas to Europe!
3264 2018-07-11 18:43:32 Russians are booing Croatia #CROENG
3265 2018-07-11 18:43:31 We also import lots of oil and gas from our Norwegian friends.....
3266 2018-07-11 18:43:30 Germany only gets 20% of their oil&gas from Russia, and it's privately financed! USA gets 60% of oil & gas from Canada, VENEZUELA, MEXICO, SAUDI ARABIA, etc; so HYPOCRITICAL!! MUST CONSIDER intangible benefits NATO allies contribute (bloodshed, NatSec aid!); NOT all about money!
3267 2018-07-11 18:43:28 My face is gonna end up breaking out from da oil that’s in my hair cuz it keeps running on my face i
3268 2018-07-11 18:43:24 Time for an oil change... oooh, lordy! ＼(＾O＾)／
3269 2018-07-11 18:43:17 The way my bank account is lookin, I might have to find me a Dubia oil princess to fly me out and shit on me.. scary hours...
3270 2018-07-11 18:43:15 More to my point. No country should be subservient to another country. Helping Putin accomplish his dirty work is the last thing an American President should do.  We need to stand up to Putin, not be bullied by him.  Russia depends on revenue from selling its oil and gas.
3271 2018-07-11 18:43:14 Don’t like the way Trump is openly bickering with our NATO allies, those negotiations should take place behind closed doors, but, Trump has a point about Germany buying oil from Russia, if Russia is such a problem, why is Germany supporting them?
3272 2018-07-11 18:43:13 So if Russia controls Germany because 70% oil imports and Germany controls USA because 70% car imports then surely Russia must control USA - but then we’ve known that all along anyway!
3273 2018-07-11 18:43:12 Higher food prices, higher electric rates, higher gas and oil prices, and who knows what's next. You Republicans haven't done a thing to help anyone but the wealthy, and corporations
3274 2018-07-11 18:43:11 If Germany wants the US to defend them via NATO from the Russians then buy oil from the US not Russia they kiss Russia’s ass & expect us to defend them from RUSSIA seriously? Those days r over
3275 2018-07-11 18:43:09 So I’m here getting an oil change and they keep finding things wrong with my car. Then the man at the service station goes “I think it’s time to move on. Cars will let you down” which is relatable to every aspect of my life.
3276 2018-07-11 18:43:08 Bulling Germany.  Germans help with the Minsk agreement.  McCain and Bush Dynasty wants?   Or for us to sell gas and oil.  We have two law suits against us now with the WTO.
3277 2018-07-11 18:43:03 Lol oil markets are the best worst day of the year by far. 
3278 2018-07-11 18:43:03 So I took a day trip away from the net, just got back... what the bloody fucking hell happened to oil today?
3279 2018-07-11 18:42:58 Wait until that guy get a pic of my junk!
3280 2018-07-11 18:42:52 As the crude oil  prices crashing, dollar  strengthening worldwide market it's imperative as well as facilitating situation for #Rupee devaluation which wl eventually boost our merchandise exports including #textiles & improve our trade deficit.@smritiirani @FinMinIndia @RBI
3281 2018-07-11 18:42:49 Stop putting more oil into the fire, Tom. 
3282 2018-07-11 18:42:48 Thanks to Bob's Wheel Alignment for their honesty! They said I don't need a wheel bearing just tires on the back. University Tire & Auto said I needed a bearing. Done with University Tire except maybe oil changes
3283 2018-07-11 18:42:45 And it's actually you folks that are all over the place. Trump is allegedly doing Putin's bidding by wanting to strengthen NATO and cutting off oil imports from Russia, which will destabilize the Russian economy. That's actually anti-Putin.
3284 2018-07-11 18:42:33 Do you have any idea how many times you have MADE me watch you oil that cute bottom today????
3285 2018-07-11 18:42:31 //Hell yeah
3286 2018-07-11 18:42:31 Better than @Gap or @Carhartt I don’t need heavy boxy orange jean jackets I’m not changing oil and neither are you
3287 2018-07-11 18:42:23 So Oil not going to $100 in 18 months now or???
3288 2018-07-11 18:42:19 Same applies for the UN as well.  Kick the UN out of the US and convert their fancy building into the greatest VA hospital in the land.
3289 2018-07-11 18:42:15 We should be supplying Europe’s oil and gas.
3290 2018-07-11 18:42:12 Her past does not excuse the fact that Russia has them by the short hairs with energy if ever a conflict.  Remember how we controlled Japan oil in WWII?  Why won’t you focus on the legitimate issue Trump raises rather than her feelings?

3292 2018-07-11 18:42:01 Why did you call the Saudis the chief sponsor of terrorism in the world and yet offer them a huge weapons deal and still allow their oil to come to our shores?
3293 2018-07-11 18:42:00 #Oil  $70 .... 
3294 2018-07-11 18:41:57 Why should it matter what country Germany gets their gas or oil! Doesn't the USA still import oil from Saudi Arabia? Not one country has asked the US why we still do business with a country where most of the 911 terrorist were from!
3295 2018-07-11 18:41:57 That's the beta rebelling inside you.

You probably don't have enough fat to burn. Eat more carbs (good ones) before working out, or take MCT oil.
3296 2018-07-11 18:41:55 What does a bilateral energy agreement have to do with NATO? Imagine if Merkel was talking shit about the US buying oil from OPEC and suggested the US was military allies with iran and Venezuela.  Its nonsense
3297 2018-07-11 18:41:54 so today I went to the flea market and was trying things, my mom walked over when I was trying hemp oil and she slapped me.. oops
3298 2018-07-11 18:41:51 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Raleigh sleeps.
3299 2018-07-11 18:41:50 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Los Angeles sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
3300 2018-07-11 18:41:48 "crony capital subsidies". HAHAHAHA$4billionHAHAHAAHA.  Shall I even mention full-on WARS started for our oil addiction? I gotta applaud your cajones to even bring that up as an argument against TSLA.  You're really treading water in the deep end of the self-delusion pool.
3301 2018-07-11 18:41:38 //Yeah. Probably.
3302 2018-07-11 18:41:32 In 8 days ill have owned my truck for a year....and now shes leaking coolant, my sway bar cracked, needs a battery, tune up, oil change, carrier bearing, lmfaoooo. Heres $1000 down the drain to my truck this month
3303 2018-07-11 18:41:30 If this glorious motherfucker got to the fucking oil rig with doctor and barter, I believe in him.
3304 2018-07-11 18:41:27 Let me educate you, dupshit Trump tool. The US wanted to build an oil pipeline to supply Europe directly from the middle east. The pipeline was to go througfh...Syria. Guess who intervened in Syria to (in part) stop the pipeline? Russia.
3305 2018-07-11 18:41:25 Sept Brent #OIL down $4.23, or 5.4%, at $74.63/bbl on ICE Futures Europe #energy #commodity #investing
3306 2018-07-11 18:41:16 Yo Schifty.   We are paying 370 billion more than we should.    Why should we protect Germany from Russia if they are going to become oil reliant on Russia
3307 2018-07-11 18:41:15 *spikes @BGBenevolent ‘s drink with horseradish and motor oil*
3308 2018-07-11 18:41:13 You know Trump is against hydroelectric,  geothermal, solar and those big spinning things that laugh at him while he plays golf and pro non-renewable and harmful coal and oil... Good luck being energy dominant of you ignore nearly every type of clean and renewable energy. Idiot.
3309 2018-07-11 18:41:04 So you agree Putin’s goal is to destroy NATO? It’s destruction will make all NATO nations vulnerable, including the US... their neighbour with lots of oil resources in Alaska... which was originally Russian... just saying
3310 2018-07-11 18:40:41 Seems to me as this NATO meeting is unfolding that the real collusion that is unfolding is between Germany and Russia and the oil pipeline.  Bypassing the smaller European countries.  Hmm
3311 2018-07-11 18:40:40 horses and carriages, oil lamps and different weaponry...shoot I wouldn't mind seeing Darryl with a pick axe, a modified bow with incendiary arrows, Michonne with a double bladed staff her or Ezekiel one Angela Kang might have season 9 of TWD looking like a Wild West movie
3312 2018-07-11 18:40:34 It wasnt Ontario that blocked the pipelines. Our province is crisscrossed with oil and natural gas pipelines so one more wouldnt make no difference. It was the Liberal mayor of Montreal Dennis Coderre who was the most vocal about blocking it and Trudeau let him have his way
3313 2018-07-11 18:40:25 In 2017, The secretary of the Hacienda announces that for the first time in 37 years, oil production has fallen below 2 million barrels a day.

3315 2018-07-11 18:40:24 Big risk off day and it is starting to hit bonds - but I am still struck by oil down 5% and stocks and commodities all looking awful and bonds are still only off by 3bps

3320 2018-07-11 18:39:39 To bad you can back any of his lies with truthful facts. You are like a well oil liberal democratic machine. Repeating the same thing over and over again. Maybe some day liberals will come up with a new one liner for the President

3324 2018-07-11 18:39:16 Weekly Technical Perspective on the Crude Oil Prices | #Forex
3325 2018-07-11 18:39:12 the drop of oil price today is likely to wash out the speculators.  fundamentals are bullish
3326 2018-07-11 18:39:10 Mark, I am one of your subscribers!  Don't troll me:) No one knows anything about what will happen. But don't you think a massive drop in oil usually brings down the market, at least temporarily?
3327 2018-07-11 18:39:09 At 5% of total US production California is in the top 5 (of 32) oil producing states. Only Texas & N Dakota produce more. #cdnpoli
3328 2018-07-11 18:38:57 Sure she does as she wheels and deals for the best prices on Putin's gas and oil.
3329 2018-07-11 18:38:57 I am do not know if you look at outside mkts, but can not think es can escape the damage done to oil and copper and the effect those 2 have on crb
3330 2018-07-11 18:38:46 I grew up Pentecostal/Evangelical and am very familiar with consecrated oil :) you could always find someone that had it… in case of an emergency 
3331 2018-07-11 18:38:39 I get so much pushback when I mention it but the parallels are soooo obvious. Spice = oil, etc.
3332 2018-07-11 18:38:32 Sadly the majority will pay for the fools who bought the snake oil.
3333 2018-07-11 18:38:29 Shorted oil this morning, probably my greatest decision of 2018 to this date.
3334 2018-07-11 18:38:23 does anyone know if lemongrass oil is ok for your face
3335 2018-07-11 18:38:21 La subieron justo en la parte alta del canal del oil y con el USD en el techo. Todo ganancia por unos eses . Son una vergüenza
3336 2018-07-11 18:38:19 Is that a request?
3337 2018-07-11 18:38:15 Why we keep buying crude oil from Arab countries who attacked  us on 9/11
3338 2018-07-11 18:38:10 Yeah they do this odd thing of controlling non similiar issues as if Starbucks has any control in oil pipelines or people can’t multi task

So My Fellow Americans,Do Not Purchase Gasoline,just for one Day JULY 18,2018,and watch your Gasoline$$ DROP!
3342 2018-07-11 18:37:47 I cannot get the smell of oil base out of my nose.
3343 2018-07-11 18:37:44 MAKE NO MISTAKE when the #TraitorInChief berated Germany for buying RU oil it was a PLANNED #DISTRACTION from his upcoming SOLO meeting with #Putin.  

He wants us to believe w/ behavior like that he couldn't possibly have colluded Soviet Dictator.  #TrumpLies #NATOSummit #MSNBC
3344 2018-07-11 18:37:40 Out in the barn looking for a Hasp with mom and she grabs the coffee can full of old deep fryer oil/fish oil mixture that I use for trapping.....it dumped on her a bit and I laughed till my stomach hurt
3345 2018-07-11 18:37:28 You misspelled “government employee.”
3346 2018-07-11 18:37:15 Lol of course I'm low on oil when I can't afford to buy any
3347 2018-07-11 18:37:03 Disagree. Japan's overriding problem was political instability - no focus possible as long as either Army or Navy can bring down the government.

I'm also skeptical that oil / steel resource limits would have permitted much further naval buildup. Gotta fuel the ships somehow.
3348 2018-07-11 18:36:59 The states buys a lot of western oil actually makes around a hundred million a day off of our WESTERN  oil because we are not allowed access to market! Who do you think blocks pipelines! I’m sure if the states really were approached they would side with the gravy train!
3349 2018-07-11 18:36:58 Seeing my car in the air while I'm getting an oil change gives me anxiety. 
3350 2018-07-11 18:36:55 By the way, we buy 60% of our oil from across the Atlantic...
3351 2018-07-11 18:36:45 Lol we need some hair growth oil or something
3352 2018-07-11 18:36:22 This is why I don’t take the trash out I got oil all over my white shoes 
3353 2018-07-11 18:36:18 How much investment do you think Brennan and Kerry have in Russia Oil company?
3354 2018-07-11 18:36:13 Which is why you should support NATO becoming stronger through more military spending, especially on cyber security, along with cutting Putin off at the knees by stop importing Russian oil that accounts for 25 percent of his GDP.
3355 2018-07-11 18:36:08 50 minutes na footage, gagawin mong 15 minutes? Gahd pano?? 
3356 2018-07-11 18:36:05 That’s the idea. America to be self sufficient, have matching tarrifs: (protects our manufacturing, produce-and oil) We have had 0% tarrifs while the entire world levies tarrifs to keep our goods out and dumps their cheap goods here for free. Trump wants 0% on both sides.

3359 2018-07-11 18:35:52 I held off on getting gas in my car late last week b/c I had such a strong feeling oil would decline. unfortunately my gas tank couldn't wait any longer and I had to fill up today. So close!
3360 2018-07-11 18:35:51 Is he trying get Germany to buy U.S. or Saudi oil or gas?
3361 2018-07-11 18:35:49 A) The commitment is for 2024, not 2025.
B) The only time article 5, Collective Defence, was enacted was to defend the US.
C)The US is importing ~150,000 thousand barrels of Russian Crude Oil and Petroleum, annually.
D) Some countries have Constitutional restrictions on Armies.
3362 2018-07-11 18:35:48 7th largest wkly draw in history dating back to 1983(ex-SPR), largest ever for month of July all w/ US oil production @ all time highs..oil down 5% haha

3366 2018-07-11 18:35:36 Wed Jul 11 Dinner
Catch~ Blackened Amberjack Fish served with Creamy Caper Sauce 
Choice~ Walnut Oil Sautéed Lamb over Caponata with Feta Bean Salad
3367 2018-07-11 18:35:35 Wait, we buy oil from 1.Saudi Arabia that destroyed the World Trade Center, 2. Mexico where we imprison their child migrants.3. Venezuela a communist country. And 4. Canada who we're in a trade war with. Now what's your beef, you hypocritical orange mutant?
3368 2018-07-11 18:35:34 I hate when the time comes around for an oil change...it’s always hectic.
3369 2018-07-11 18:35:33 With mayo instead of oil/vinegar.
3370 2018-07-11 18:35:29 A hydrating facial mask, bright purple, with beetle mica, jojoba oil, and exfoliating moisture spheres. It comes as a powder in a metallic tube.
3371 2018-07-11 18:35:19 Yeah that never helped with me either lol I put myself into labor with Elizabeth doing that castor oil shit and from shitting my brains out all night it contracted my uterus and started labor
3372 2018-07-11 18:35:15 @eDante_ you car shows the oil light when you start it right? What of when you start driving it?
3373 2018-07-11 18:35:14 Putin’s too busy trying to rebuild the Russian economy - hence Russia spending 10% of the US military budget. Who is it exactly the US is protecting us from? We’re the ones invading countries & slaughtering innocents to steal oil & keep the petrodollar/ military ind complex going
3374 2018-07-11 18:35:07 need to learn everything from changing oil to changing my tires so i don't have to ask a mf'r for help when the times comes 
3375 2018-07-11 18:35:07 Of course, it's always useful to have another rag around the house for checking the oil level in the car, cleaning up cat barf, etc.
3376 2018-07-11 18:35:00 I do not agree with this oo,have been using coconut oil for yearrrrrsssssssss for my skin.
moreover for sugar scrub..exfoliating Shld not  be done regularly because definitely it will cause damage to your skin... once/twice or when necessary is idle,also same with lime/lemon
3377 2018-07-11 18:34:58 Wonder why Germans buy oil from Russia then.
3378 2018-07-11 18:34:55 Oil down 5% today to $70.38.
3379 2018-07-11 18:34:54 @Mazda_SA Greetings Is kerosene oil Mazda (6) 2016 changes after Kam Kilo is changed and thanks
3380 2018-07-11 18:34:49 I guess you'll call out indigenous rappers for appropriating black culture? And maybe we should make sure no one who is not of European descent should ever pick up a brush to try their hand at oil painting. And don't even THINK about playing the bagpipes if you're not Scottish.
3381 2018-07-11 18:34:33 Well Castor Oil works for all hair but especially our beards
3382 2018-07-11 18:34:32 i real life know nothing about cars and always get so scared when i have to get my oil changed.
3383 2018-07-11 18:34:27 Oh Nancy, U don't even always know who our president is. You are senile. We got our "crumbs" thanks to the #taxcuts we have more in our paychecks. We know #POTUS is working hard to bring oil prices down. We trust him. He is not apologizing for us. He is fighting for us. Go Away!

3392 2018-07-11 18:33:39 Opinion pieces often view topics with blinders, ignoring parameter factors that affect mission.
America provides sanctions against Moscow over its occupation of Crimea while Germany pays Russia for an oil pipeline, enriching a supposed enemy enabling them to fund their military.
3393 2018-07-11 18:33:36 By his logic America is a captive of China (they hold the majority of our debt) or Saudi Arabia (oil).
3394 2018-07-11 18:33:35 Wait, our allies are buying oil from Russia, giving them money, and then want the U.S.A. to defend them from Russia? And you think that protects people from fascism? By funding a dictator? K
3395 2018-07-11 18:33:33 does anyone know how to change the oil on a bike, and if so can you teach me.
3396 2018-07-11 18:33:32 Hemp and CBD oil are the next big thing . As we get laws passed it will boom ! Loving learning about all its benefits ...all natural and no high ( no THC ) 
3397 2018-07-11 18:33:32 Much faster than getting politicians beholden to Big Oil  and fossil fuel interests (Exxon, BP, Kochs, Saudis) to invest in “renewables” - US gets 81% of its energy from fossil fuels - the more we consume under the existing model, the deeper these interests will get entrenched.
3398 2018-07-11 18:33:26 Actually what would really knock out the fossil fuel industry and oil dictatorships is shifting over to nuclear power and electrification of other industries/sectors.

Renewables can’t cover our energy needs alone.
3399 2018-07-11 18:33:25 I am sweaty and tired from mixing my jar of all natural organic almond butter, trying to mix the clay-dense almond with the oil. I’m never buying this shit again. Not worth it

3403 2018-07-11 18:33:03 Coconut oil’s MCTs have been shown to have a few different fat loss benefits.

First, it can help to increase feelings of fullness, which can lead to a natural reduction in the amount of food you eat.

Tune in tomorrow for the second way coconut oil can benefit fat loss

3407 2018-07-11 18:32:44 Them oil pens be having niggas slumped lmao
3408 2018-07-11 18:32:33 Ill give this to you it could be one big conspiracy but I highly doubt it. We invaded Afghanistan first because of 9/11 and moved onto Iraq for "wmd" which was a lie but we removed Saddam during that time. as for Lybia im not very informed on us bring there. Now we're off of oil.

3415 2018-07-11 18:31:55 So, you want allied countries to buy more expensive oil & gas?  From who?  Your ultimate desire is to “do a real estate deal” with Russia, how is this different?

3418 2018-07-11 18:31:47 I was wrong.  US is top oil producer, not exporter.  I will try to remember that.
My point about Yemen, though, is that 20-30 years ago a war like Yemen's would have been a top priority (sort of like IRan-Iraq war) because we were more dependent on gulf oil.
3419 2018-07-11 18:31:45 I pray England dont get punished
3420 2018-07-11 18:31:43 its extension but it is its own brand, its not regular coke... its the "zero". There is also Mobil 1. Mobil is the company name but 1 is the oil brand
3421 2018-07-11 18:31:38 So you believe that encouraging NATO to become more muscular against Russia and stop supporting the Russian oil industry, which accounts for 25 percent of Putin's GDP is supporting Putin? Interesting.
3422 2018-07-11 18:31:29 Doesnt everyone? Its like a portable garden hose with a spray nozzle!
3423 2018-07-11 18:31:28 Liberals have been screaming about Russia for over a year. Trump calls out Germany for buy billions in Russian oil and liberals say he's attacking our allies.
   If you are a rational Democrat then it's time to...... 
#walkaway
3424 2018-07-11 18:31:26 So how IS agreeing to let the Russia, the country that NATO is designed to contain, control 70% of Germany's oil good for us while we are committed to defend them?

3430 2018-07-11 18:31:11 Just saved $60 cause its not time for a oil change 
3431 2018-07-11 18:31:09 This 2% nonsense and the Germany energy question are stupid. The correct question is: "what percentage of Russia's oil and gas goes to Europe?" That number tells you the extent to which it is economically impractical for Russia to start a conflict with Germany/Europe.

3446 2018-07-11 18:29:50 U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Tuesday that Washington would consider requests from some countries to be exempt from sanctions due to go into effect in November to prevent Iran from exporting oil.

3449 2018-07-11 18:29:38 Aloe vera gel & rosehip oil for me
3450 2018-07-11 18:29:31 Trump’s statement is tantamount to saying the US is captive to whomever is our largest supplier of oil and/or natural gas aside from ourselves. It’s nonsense but his Fox watching base won’t understand.
3451 2018-07-11 18:29:29 Kogi state should be amongst the richest in Nigeria outside of the oil producing states, considering the variety of solid minerals there but because of govt inaction traceable to corruption, bad policies and a lack of political will, the state is so poor it can't pay salaries...
3452 2018-07-11 18:29:19 When you've traded as long as I have, you use the mkt 4 things like timing buying airline tix. We have a trip planned late Sept. I did not want to buy tix until oil corrected-now, I wait to see if the flight prices respond in kind. $USO $AAL $JBLU

3454 2018-07-11 18:29:15 Right! Right!!  He called out Germany for cozying up to Russia over a trade deal for oil and gas.  Get your facts right chump.  Stop lying to the American people.
3455 2018-07-11 18:29:09 If these dummies on @CNBC would be honest and see past their scripted & transparent Trump hate… they’d realize Trump’s really putting the screws to PUTIN by demanding Germany get off Russian Oil, not Europe! He’s about to meet w/ Putin, that’s amazing leverage to negotiate with.

3462 2018-07-11 18:28:20 Shall we nationalize oil like Norway? Nope 
Shall we have undue legal fines based on income like finland? Nope
Shall we make those on welfare work in public areas like Sweden? Never happen.

3463 2018-07-11 18:28:12 Hello @redcarpetrobot $10 oil change special. :-)
3464 2018-07-11 18:28:08 He's not attacking an oil-pipeline. He's attacking Germany so that what he's done seems less relevant. We ourselves receive billions of dollars in oil exports from Russia. Trump doesn't care about pipelines — he cares about his reputation, and is attacking others to save it.
3465 2018-07-11 18:28:01 False. Trump is wrong. Germany only gets 35% of its oil from Russia. (Even the US imports oil)
3466 2018-07-11 18:27:58 Fox News has also been public relations flacking for Russian banksters and oil men for a few years now.
3467 2018-07-11 18:27:57 NATO countries are, indeed, among America's closest allies, but some of them appear more interested in oil, natural gas, and trade with Iran than in the Fulda Gap.  Some of our "closest allies" have been working overtime to undermine America.
3468 2018-07-11 18:27:57 No no it would not we have resources and we have industry! We ship our oil to the states they ship it back up to you?
3469 2018-07-11 18:27:56 Cheap oil is Stealth QE Luke to a wounded economy. Think of the cost to US if high oil juices inflation impacting refinancing cost of US debt, cost of living increases to welfare, Social Security, military etc.
3470 2018-07-11 18:27:51 @adnickens our dear leader can use a lesson or two from text books of MA in national security. Wait he is likely born with those skills :)

3479 2018-07-11 18:27:10 Try the oil markets if you want to ride an emotional rollercoaster. Oil should be easy — supply down, prices up; supply up, prices down. Uh, no. I think codependency tendencies and emotional instability are requirements to be an oil trader.

3482 2018-07-11 18:27:03 Good question EaglePundit sounds like They take AMERICAN Money  & Buy the enemy’s Oil&Gas & Energy needs!!! So l think Russia  don’t You???
3483 2018-07-11 18:27:01 Thank you for the support on Oil Day! We are back to normal. We had some price drops and a few great sales today too. See the deals page!
3484 2018-07-11 18:26:53 Ooh sounds like your skin is loving all that lavender oil and fresh rose infusion! 
3485 2018-07-11 18:26:41 I have been asked by many clients if CBD oil will show up in their drug tests. Drug tests test for presence of THC. Since my oil contains less than 0.03% THC. You would need to take approximately 1500mg per DAY to trigger enough THC for a failed test.
3486 2018-07-11 18:26:36 Wonder how many people are getting suckered into oil short here. #oott
3487 2018-07-11 18:26:31 His point seemed to be more that Russia is not really NATO’s enemy and Germany’s oil pipeline hypocrisy proves that. It was his way of attacking what he considers paranoia about Russia.
3488 2018-07-11 18:26:29 $OIL now, then stocks. Rocky August coming up

3491 2018-07-11 18:26:18 FACT: Ezra Levant is lying POS who's in the back pocket of the NRA and the oil lobby. He's an enemy to Canada and Canadians. He spreads lies, half-truths and propagates xenophobia.
3492 2018-07-11 18:26:12 I'm starting to think that Trump's attack on Germany buying oil from Russia earlier today is setting up something he has planned for his meeting with Putin later this week.
3493 2018-07-11 18:26:11 Oil is a hot minute from its more sustainable trend line
3494 2018-07-11 18:26:08 The thing about fear mongering from obstructionist groups is that it never affects consumption or use of products made from petroleum - the very thing driving the necessity of oil and natural gas. #wednesdaywisdom #thinkaboutit
3495 2018-07-11 18:26:05 3. Oil price
3496 2018-07-11 18:26:01 Going to get a new tire today & probably a oil change
3497 2018-07-11 18:25:53 Yet they send Russia billions in energy dollars. So Russia can build their military and we need to defend them at our cost from... Russia.  

Buy oil from someone else.
3498 2018-07-11 18:25:46 Young is looking a bit ropey this match... has he taken his Seven Seas oil today?? #ENGCRO
3499 2018-07-11 18:25:43 Not only can we feed our selves but we have one the worlds largest potash reserves, rich in oil, Coal, and diamonds other minerals and uranium!

3501 2018-07-11 18:25:40 They could put a Rook in the arcade shops in Asbury but instead they went with five identical tiedye stores, nj natural gas, and an olive oil bar
3502 2018-07-11 18:25:31 Countries are free to trade with whomever they want unless there are sanctions. You just want to sell them American oil & gas.
3503 2018-07-11 18:25:29 Crude Oil prints fresh session low at 70.01. #forex #CRUDEOIL
3504 2018-07-11 18:25:28 Jealous much that other countries have deals with your buddy Putin and aren’t dependent on Middle East oil?  Stop policing the world and fighting wars all over and your defense spending will drop.  Go ahead and alienate the few allies you still have.  Goon!
3505 2018-07-11 18:25:25 So today I found out that there is a cart near my office which sells 'sandhay ka oil.' it's basically oil extracted from a lizard, you use it massage your  dick and it will increase your timing. 

He slaughters the lizard and extracts oil using a syringe. Live.
3506 2018-07-11 18:24:53 Doesn’t spell well for the tar sands. But Permian shouldn’t get to comfortable, once that Aramco IPO is filled (if ever) I suspect they’ll start drowning the market full of cheap oil.
3507 2018-07-11 18:24:37 I got some bear oil the other day. Am I doing it right?
3508 2018-07-11 18:24:34 Oil price relief today but $AAL among carriers dragging down #PrimeCapOdyssey Agg Growth fundholders.
3509 2018-07-11 18:24:23 Oil tankers are not going to help, for sure.
3510 2018-07-11 18:24:20 And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.

3517 2018-07-11 18:23:43 Don’t be so gullible.  Kushner was selling visas to wealthy Chinese.  Cohen was selling access to him to Arab oil sheiks.  Trump himself dumped hundreds of millions in  debt from his casinos on the taxpayers of NJ.  Once a grifter, always a grifter.

3519 2018-07-11 18:23:04 It's time Germany buys oil and gas from the US. Support US workers and our oil and gas industry!

3521 2018-07-11 18:22:51 oil change? at auto zone??
3522 2018-07-11 18:22:50 Hopefully Matt will use solar power, pay his employees a living wage, and recycles cooking oil to mention a few. Matt put your money where your mouth is.
3523 2018-07-11 18:22:37 @RFCARWASH do you guys do tire rotation with your oil changes?
3524 2018-07-11 18:22:37 @kettlebrand Are the chips cooked in avocado oil produced in the same facility as your salt & pepper krinkle cut?
3525 2018-07-11 18:22:27 Unfortunately „someone“ has to recognise, that Germany with over 90Mio people (1/3 of US) and a size less than 1/2 of the smallest US-State isn‘t mining oil or gas at it‘s small territory.. it has to buy it.. the only neighbours that sell are: Russia, Turkey, and Arabia.. so.....
3526 2018-07-11 18:22:25 Get Vlad to sort the VAR in exchange for Scotland, but take the last of the oil out without telling him first #ENGCRO
3527 2018-07-11 18:22:22 The capitalist billionaire siphon off the world's oil into their tankers, while millions have to burn manure for heat.
3528 2018-07-11 18:22:22 Don't let your hair get into your face while you sleep. The oil from your hair can cause acne.
3529 2018-07-11 18:22:19 Senator if Germany has decided to purchase oil from Russia they are undermining themselves and NATO if the ball drops they will run short of supplies so the president is telling them to wake up
3530 2018-07-11 18:22:06 We have always been against Germany's dependance on Russian oil
3531 2018-07-11 18:22:03 I disagree the Fed/Treasury want cheap oil.  To the contrary, IMO it is a matter of US national security to have 1) expensive oil, but 2) not too expensive oil.  This necessitates a steady stream of "Unplanned Production Outages" at cheaper oil suppliers
3532 2018-07-11 18:22:03 garnier yg kuning kan oil tuh katanya bagus juga
3533 2018-07-11 18:22:01 The US produces almost half of our oil demand. The other half, we import 40% from Canada. So try again with the math. 
3534 2018-07-11 18:21:56 If you are trading Brent Oil, you must be having a bad day, I'm afraid this may continue until there's certainty on Iran issue. But if you are bearish then you must be very happy, it's a good idea to hold on
3535 2018-07-11 18:21:53 i appreciate your constant journey of micro-adversities and have ozonated olive oil in the fridge for your wounds
3536 2018-07-11 18:21:51 WW1 - US participation 2½ years after start of war.
WW2 - Did not give a F*** for Europe for 2 years, then Pearl Harbor woke US up.
Korea - A war kept alive and Lost by US.
Vietnam - Total loss for US
Kuwait - Loss of enormous amount of oil rescources. US loose.
3537 2018-07-11 18:21:28 Several but it must always be remembered pushy arrogant US forced Japans hand in south Pacific with oil embargo
3538 2018-07-11 18:21:25 @marksandspencer and @waitrose disappointd to see that most of your sandwiches contain palm oil/palm fat. What are you doing about it?
3539 2018-07-11 18:21:21 they have oil?? tf
3540 2018-07-11 18:21:19 A bit but not really these days. 2007 was a different story but the US is producing a lot of oil these days.
3541 2018-07-11 18:21:13 Germany doesn't even pay their two percent and expect the US to protect them from Russia, yet they also make a deal with Russia for a Baltic pipeline which will double Russia's  oil exports in the region.   Germany is paying billions to help build this.  #playingbothsides

3545 2018-07-11 18:20:57 That oil change got my baby driving so much better!
3546 2018-07-11 18:20:57 Fake news extravaganza in (UAE/Jordan-based) Libyan news outlets today to explain or sell Haftar's surprising u-turn on oil exports. A letter from Trump threatening force and a supposedly leaked - but clearly fake - document from a Libya-related meeting of six states in Rome.
3547 2018-07-11 18:20:56 DEPENDS on how long the price of oil stays down
3548 2018-07-11 18:20:55 Ok let me get this straight: #Oil -5%  #USDJPY up ?!? #EURUSD down #Silver and #Gold sell-off. Something is cooking!
3549 2018-07-11 18:20:47 Sir, if crude oil prices drop. Rupee will gain strength.
Won't markets rally for this

3551 2018-07-11 18:20:44 FYI,
Oil prices hit a multi-year high on 7/2, just below $79 a barrel. Morgan Stanley expects international prices to hit $85 a barrel in the second half of 2018, which is $7.50 higher than their previous projection.

3553 2018-07-11 18:20:37 Except that makes no sense as the US outputs 3x's as much Oil as Canada. Try using facts not dumb tagline, eh?

#dumptrump
3554 2018-07-11 18:20:29 why did my brother ask me if we have olive oil, we’re arabs JORDANIANS to be specific ofc ee have olive oil we probably have more olive oil than water in this household
3555 2018-07-11 18:20:28 Trump inadvertently got his Oil prices down....
3556 2018-07-11 18:20:22 Olive &amp; almond oil are rich in essential fatty acids which help strengthen dry &amp; cracked nails
3557 2018-07-11 18:20:21 It is strange, considering we purchase oil from Russia too and we have a 10 billion dollar trade deficit which also helps their economy.  Also those NATO troops that fought with us after 9/11... super weird!
3558 2018-07-11 18:20:19 Which is hilarious to me, because the Oil Rig is a goddamn death trap for companions, especially Marcus who can't wear power armor. Last time I tried he and Goris (an intelligent talking albino deathclaw) died in the first round of fighting
3559 2018-07-11 18:20:17 We can't get the gas prices lowered fast enough and we need to stop relying on foreign nations for our oil needs. Someday!....
3560 2018-07-11 18:20:14 I am a personal trainer by day, and I’ve seen better and more long term results with people who naturally lose fat.

If it helped you, that’s great. But in my professional opinion, it is just a snake oil remedy.
3561 2018-07-11 18:20:13 That's about as dumb as the United States getting all of it's steel from China. Now I'm admiteley not the smartest guy on the block,but putting such important items such as oil and steel in someone else's control. This hillbilly says ain't too bright!
3562 2018-07-11 18:20:11 You just want them to buy the oil you blew up Syria for.
3563 2018-07-11 18:20:03 Current news on oil prices 
Oil is crashing today. 
Hopfully in a couple weeks we see the same for our tanks.
If, you a tank
3564 2018-07-11 18:20:03 I am a weak whiny babyperson and I had no problem not using straws. I love the idea of giant dudes who jack off to Sam Elliot posters and chew steel tobacco complaining about not being able to use a straw to drink their motor oil or whatever
3565 2018-07-11 18:20:02 وين نحصله بالكويت؟
3566 2018-07-11 18:19:53 How many other NATO countries are beholden to Russia for their oil and gas?? Germany needs to get rid of Merkel and her party for giving their security over to Russia
3567 2018-07-11 18:19:52 Morgan Oil is so clutch!!!
3568 2018-07-11 18:19:50 เห็นข่าวล่ะโมโหไอ้สัสนุ่นชิบหาย ตบกัวลุงจนลั่น แล้วคือมาทำคลิปขอโทษ ขอโทษพ่อมึงอ่ะ ดูก็รู้ว่าบังคับ ตายไปดิ๊ อยู่ไปก็เกะกะโลกก
3569 2018-07-11 18:19:49 Trump tells NATO, Germany is controlled by Russia because that’s from where Germany gets its oil.
Ok, well, by that logic....
Trump is controlled by Russia because that’s from where Trump got his presidency! ..  #RT
3570 2018-07-11 18:19:44 I'm about to learn how to change my own oil
3571 2018-07-11 18:19:43 Don’t back down Mr. President make them pay NOW not in 2024...to far away. If they don’t pay, no more protection. We must come first. Germany buying oil from Russia while we pritect them NO WAY..make a deal they buy our oil for protection. We stand behind you. WWG1WGA. MAGA!!!!
3572 2018-07-11 18:19:41 Imagine the world when we run out of oil
3573 2018-07-11 18:19:33 Or the province where the oil originated?
3574 2018-07-11 18:19:32 PSA: if you're having joint pain, take fish oil. I cannot stress enough how much this will help, got off of it for years and 3 days ago my elbows and knees were hurting so bad I could hardly lift. Been back on fish oil for a day and a half and I have almost no pain.
3575 2018-07-11 18:19:30 Little do you know just how much oil is transported by barge and ship just out of sight of our beaches. More in one day than spilled by all drill rigs combined. OUT OF SIGHT, OUT OF MIND.
3576 2018-07-11 18:19:29 What good is Trump’s stupid tariff war with Canada when 90% of the oil we purchase comes from there?
3577 2018-07-11 18:19:12 And then there's a few more people who make callbacks or references to the events in 2. Marcus the Super Mutant was a companion in 2 who mentions he was with The Chosen One (Fallout 2 protagonist) when he took on the Enclave on the Poseidon Oil Rig.
3578 2018-07-11 18:19:07 It's super easy! Roast ur cauliflower at 400 for 20 min tossed in olive oil, Franks red hot, garlic powder, S&P.. Then mix ur buffalo.. 1-2 tbsp butter and equal parts hot sauce (the butter is essential) .....
3579 2018-07-11 18:19:03 太るから?だから僕を突き放すの?オイルが嫌いなの?オイルに罪は無いだろう…?
3580 2018-07-11 18:18:55 OiIwa?? Oil wa?? ???? what is that?
3581 2018-07-11 18:18:54 I make my own oil pen cartridges and feel the same way!
3582 2018-07-11 18:18:47 That's cuz everyone working for oil, is taking a soccer break. it'll be fine in 2hrs
3583 2018-07-11 18:18:45 Random things like tanning on the trampoline with my kids  telling them how I used #crisco as a tanning oil when I was little haha I looked like I rolled around in caramel .. having them ask what Crisco is  those are the summer moments I've been wanting.
3584 2018-07-11 18:18:41 $USDCAD wow. #Dollar up, #oil Down. When #oil was moving up, this pair didn't do anything. Now moving down, this is moving up. Shorting here over 1.32
3585 2018-07-11 18:18:35 A hustle is a hustle but I don’t see y’all giving props to kids in the hood who’s parents came up and they’re kids got the benefit from it. Because when like Ray Ray got his Jag ain’t nobody care because his daddy got oil money! Oh arddddd
3586 2018-07-11 18:18:32 Coconut oil does wonders lol
3587 2018-07-11 18:18:18 NATO mission is to safeguard freedom & security of its members. Trouble is US pays an unfair burden of its cost & manpower; yet Germany is paying for a pipeline to receive oil from a country it wants indemnity from, enriching its enemy in lieu of its protector. Why?
3588 2018-07-11 18:18:12 Oil down 6.2% Very positive for india /inflation/yeilds and Banks as well...lets see..tomo
3589 2018-07-11 18:17:57 I just put some oil in my care and said “that’s probably enough” and stopped and that’s the level of “I don’t give a fuck” I am on today.
3590 2018-07-11 18:17:56 Carter was a great President who was unlucky to be Prez when the Iranian Revolution occurred sending oil up by 300% at the same time Volker raised rates to 18% to kill inflation.  Started airline, trucking and telecom deregulation, and advanced a progressive agenda
3591 2018-07-11 18:17:54 Looking for an essential oil to cure my intolerance towards couples that share their food.
3592 2018-07-11 18:17:52 Fascinating, never heard of this stuff. I use a coconut oil mask in kind of the same way once a week or so... which ends up being about every other wash.
3593 2018-07-11 18:17:43 HOW does "Putin win"? Trump is calling out Germany for paying BILLIONS to Russia for oil and gas. Putin is winning bc Germany is doing big business with Russia.  Americans get it.
You're a reporter??? Unreal.
3594 2018-07-11 18:17:41 tRump’s statement that Germany gets 70% of it’s oil/gas from Russia is blatantly false. Germany gets 30%. @realDonaldTrump
3595 2018-07-11 18:17:38 biore cleansing oil
3596 2018-07-11 18:17:37 Just use vegetable oil or a very light olive oil
3597 2018-07-11 18:17:35 Brent already lost 5 dollars today. Great news and hope it falls further. Cheap oil is the best argument for the world peace!
3598 2018-07-11 18:17:33 Acupuncture!!! And CBD oil :)
3599 2018-07-11 18:17:25 The condition of blacks in America is worst where virtually no whites are present and the few that are live under same conditions.
3600 2018-07-11 18:17:23 What will really help with that is allowing oil and gas companies to pillage federal lands. #EatADickZinke
3601 2018-07-11 18:17:22 It is really no business of anybody where Germany gets its oil. It least we didn’t steel it through manipulation and wars!!!
3602 2018-07-11 18:17:20 kinda interesting airlines getting smoked with oil getting smoked...
3603 2018-07-11 18:17:16 Crude Oil sell off into close......lows of day ....dive alert
3604 2018-07-11 18:17:12 Retaliation for Perry, being left out of peace negotiations during WW1, US embargo on oil. Also, they were hoping to lower US morale to keep them out of the war so they could conquer more territory.

3606 2018-07-11 18:17:06 Mark, do you think the US experience oil and gas layoffs this year? Market was going up and now it’s going back down ... ????

3608 2018-07-11 18:17:04 @WNBA because yall got moisture problems that we dont have and its not johnson & johnson , its not baby oil its yall in ability to eat bananas
3609 2018-07-11 18:17:00 officially open your coconut oil jar with caution weather
3610 2018-07-11 18:16:52 Yeah, again.... I'm much less worried about people abandoning them over those issues than I am over his socks. He is a politician. Even polls that lean in favor of scrapping the oil industry don't get nationwide support for it. First you must convince the people about it.. Socks
3611 2018-07-11 18:16:50 Wow oil -5.7%
3612 2018-07-11 18:16:46 i had a dream that i met harry styles and that my whole school was like being attacked by bleachers and killing everyone with oil? and i saw harry ran to him he was like@performing on stage and some people were alive and he smiled at me and later one me and this random girl -
3613 2018-07-11 18:16:38 Are you using beard oil?
3614 2018-07-11 18:16:38 Just insure making a pipeline thru canada we don't give them more than it would cost to process and ship oil to lower 48 think how many alaskan people would be employed
3615 2018-07-11 18:16:27 Why are you against NATO spending more in the face of Russian aggression and cutting off purchasing oil from Russia, which is 25 percent of their GDP? This would seem to strengthen NATO, not diminish it, and hurt Russia.
3616 2018-07-11 18:16:26 OIL
3617 2018-07-11 18:16:23 Need some legitimate beard oil and creams.
3618 2018-07-11 18:16:20 Just another Liberal problem! Seems every time the Left touch’s something, it goes bad   How can there be oil, and no money coming into a Province?
3619 2018-07-11 18:16:14 Olive oil!
3620 2018-07-11 18:16:14 Does tRump know how anything works? Watching him speak about Germany being controlled by Russia because that’s where their oil comes from made me cringe. He’s an embarrassment!
3621 2018-07-11 18:16:10 The world for the foreseeable future revolves around oil and natural gas, we produce both. We're now a net exporter of both because our extraction and production technology is more efficient than OPEC and the Russians or anyone else. This is a great thing for the environment.
3622 2018-07-11 18:16:07 That nice feeling when you get a oil change!
3623 2018-07-11 18:16:06 You mean of Lucas Oil Stadium and the Indianapolis Colts??
3624 2018-07-11 18:16:03 Germany’s energy policy is to buy significant amounts of oil & natural gas from Russia. Policy makes G vulnerable to R manipulation & thus undermines its national security. Trump criticized it. His criticism is an attack on R because it hurts their interests.
3625 2018-07-11 18:16:00 I wonder if Trump is going to thank those B.C. protesters who are trying to force Canada into selling him our oil at bargain prices instead of selling it elsewhere at world market prices? Way to go B.C MAGA !
3626 2018-07-11 18:15:56 OIL down = USD stronger
3627 2018-07-11 18:15:55 $OIL (70.32) hasta 65 puede ir.
3628 2018-07-11 18:15:40 @OfficialPDPNig ask @MBuhari what his government is doing with our oil earnings given this revelation..

3629 2018-07-11 18:15:32 i prefer to eat then drink. i’m not sure if this is easier than doing the mix. maybe but maybe not? i’d mix grass-fed butter, coconut oil and sardines. than eat it with 2 avocados.
3630 2018-07-11 18:15:32 My car is getting a blood transfusion

Oil change, sorry
3631 2018-07-11 18:15:26 @kbsalsaud Not smart to produce more oil as we saw what happened at $30 oil, less money....not good for economy
3632 2018-07-11 18:15:20 Really? Like never? You should. They are delicious, cheap and super healthy.  Splurge and buy the ones in olive oil. And a personal fav... ones with mustard sauce.  Try smoked herring (in a can) while you are at it.
3633 2018-07-11 18:15:19 Back! For a limited time—  Blue Collar Comedy Tour Cherry-spun Chopped Chicken Monte Cristo. This baby's tenuously plated with Hell Yeah! Oil and blessed by the Flavor Valkyrie! Only $18.99!
3634 2018-07-11 18:15:19 Using the Germany controlled by Russia because oil logic...then the U.S. is controlled by Canada, eh? #OilLogic #DumpTrump #Basta #TransCanadaPipeline
3635 2018-07-11 18:15:17 This is not rare earth extraction site (could be either a heavy sand oil extraction or pipes for copper). Again there’s no comparison between batteries production and oil, gas or coal in therms of environment damage or pollution. Try again
3636 2018-07-11 18:15:16 What housing programs? While homelessness in BC has risen the feds would rather give money to foreign oil companies than put us into housing or set up more legal aid so Canadians can fight unwarranted lay-offs and other obstacles they have to reliable employment
3637 2018-07-11 18:15:13 Russiagate is a big nothing burger, while germany getting oil from rusia is a fact
3638 2018-07-11 18:15:06 Trump wants Germany to buy American oil, he wants German money nothing else. 
But Germany knows better than to make deals with the orange schoolyard bully.
3639 2018-07-11 18:14:57 like y’all not even that busy i’ve been waiting an hour for a oil change.
3640 2018-07-11 18:14:44 Too late it is already at $2.95 someone must have stubbed their toe at the refinery or the toilet got backed up at the big oil headquarters
3641 2018-07-11 18:14:33 Get what? That the POTUS is attacking Germany (an ally) for purchasing natural gas from Russia which is only 20% of their energy consumption (not 70%) while the US buys oil from other countries (including Russia) and has a 10 billion dollar trade deficit with Russia? I get it.
3642 2018-07-11 18:14:16 I'm just glad their is no #Collusion between NY Fed & banks otherwise the banks/hedgies could front run investors on the #Counterintuitive take down of oil today after biggest draw since 2016. Great strategy to recapitalize banks while driving Fed/Treasury agenda for cheap oil.
3643 2018-07-11 18:14:09 I taught a kid how to oil his chain yesterday, now football's coming home.  #Karma, definitely.
#fb
3644 2018-07-11 18:14:07 No, dude, it includes private prisons, big coal, big oil-- all for a candidate who dragged her feet on climate change in Copenhagen with a husband who gave up on Kyoto-- and partisans like you telling us she was the only candidate who would save the planet. It was a joke.
3645 2018-07-11 18:13:59 — OLIVE OIL
dip a clean,old mascara stick or a cotton swab in warm olive oil. before going to bed,apply the oil carefully on your lashes. leave it on overnight,then wash it off with lukewarm water in the morning.repeat this daily for a few months until you get the desired result.
3646 2018-07-11 18:13:53 JT's a dick alright. comes with the PM title but the danger isn't people abandoning libs over ER, it's that libs screwing BC over with their pipeline and pissing off many Canadians over their reversal on cutting oil subsidies. if enough don't vote lib, we get another CPC majority
3647 2018-07-11 18:13:53 "The grooviest and nastiest things in the world cannot be pursued or even fondled - they must be kissed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
3648 2018-07-11 18:13:49 FACT- the body needs certain good "fats" daily such as olive oil, flaxseed, sunflower and canola. A couple teaspoons is okay.
3649 2018-07-11 18:13:38 OPEC and Saudi Arabia are raising prices and have no real desire to bow down to trumps request, to raise production and bring the oil price down to aid his mid term elections. Trumps decision to reneign on the Iran deal is counter productive to his demands and is of his making
3650 2018-07-11 18:13:35 Russia ran the issues on the Iran deal and Obama gave them everything they wanted.. now with the money Iran is buying billions worth of Russian military hardware and oil equipment..... Obama was compromised by Russia.
3651 2018-07-11 18:13:26 Called to make myself a appointment for a oil changed this weekend..turns out I had already made the appointment for this weekend couple weeks ago
3652 2018-07-11 18:13:24 Love the excuses they were using to justify their dealing with the devil.
Norway has oil , why don't  they buy theirs ?
3653 2018-07-11 18:13:24 Done
3654 2018-07-11 18:13:18 みなさんお疲れ様です
3655 2018-07-11 18:13:17 How is challenging Germany’s energy policy doing the bidding of Russia? G’s energy policy is to buy significant amounts of oil & natural gas from R. Policy makes G vulnerable to R manipulation & thus undermines its national security. Trump criticized it. How is that pro Russia?
3656 2018-07-11 18:13:17 As the crude oil  prices crashing, dollar  strengthening worldwide market it's imperative as well as facilitating situation for #Rupee devaluation which wl eventually boost our merchandise exports including #textiles & improve our trade deficit.@TexMinIndia @PMOIndia @CimGOI
3657 2018-07-11 18:13:04 Where's the palm oil 
3658 2018-07-11 18:13:01 Here’s a hint - NATO doesn’t sell oil or gas. Do you think you could try and get the correct information before you start spewing nonsense?
3659 2018-07-11 18:12:52 — CASTOR OIL
use a clean brush or a cotton swab to apply castor oil on your lashes before going to bed.
follow this remedy daily for 2 to 3 months.
3660 2018-07-11 18:12:49 I took my car in to get an oil change and my sister in law was supposed to pick me up from the dealership and I’ve been waiting for the past 30 mins and I look stupid just standing here 
3661 2018-07-11 18:12:40 The grade of Russian crude isn’t on par with the United States grade of crude. Germany should be getting their oil from America, an ally of Germany. Instead they are funding Russia by allowing 70% of their energy to be manufactured by Russia.
3662 2018-07-11 18:12:34 I've been using Solarcaine Aloe Extra Gel, Aloe Coconut Oil & laying in baths of ice for the past 4 days. Any sort of movement just hurts.
3663 2018-07-11 18:12:30 It's not secret and also not new as in it didn't exist before. It's just a replacement of the old existing pipeline.

Russia has been supplying oil and gas to Europe and Asia for decades. Unfortunately this enriches Putin and his allies but that's trade for you.
3664 2018-07-11 18:12:25 $TRST is a stellar company with unique niche products in #CAMJ sector - Paul brothers have a lot of skin in the company also hands on.

It’s collaboration with Aus hospital for ALS trial, CBD oil concentration and headway in pets MJ medicines are solid revenue streams - sans hype
3665 2018-07-11 18:12:24 I use palmers coconut oil and THANK you 
3666 2018-07-11 18:12:24 Your assumption that Salmond lied is not true, he was using the market prices at the time, which are controlled by world markets, oil prices have a habit to fluctuate round about every 7 or so years, Individual Countries have little control over this
3667 2018-07-11 18:12:19 so should I assume Crude Oil does not power any of the world anymore with this drop? $USO
3668 2018-07-11 18:12:18 WTI #Crude #Oil down 4.3% trying to hold a 7 handle.  Brent down 5.6%.
3669 2018-07-11 18:12:17 Not at all. My skin is normally oily but this absorbes within minutes. One of the few things I don't have a reaction to. Also heard almond or avacado oil is good.
3670 2018-07-11 18:12:15 To ppl writing "why so pretty" under pictures of actresses:
Sit the fuck down and listen.
They get a facial atleast once a week. Use expensive af moisturizers/face wash/essential oil etc
Use branded jewellery/clothes. The picture is taken by a pro & makeup is by a professional 2.
3671 2018-07-11 18:12:14 So ASCS just had you in Bozeman then they drive you to Gillette and go back to pick up a race in Billings then to Aberdeen? Wow, that's putting in some miles in a week. Good luck tonight in Gillette. Still hoping to make the show.
3672 2018-07-11 18:12:03 Try coconut oil around the dock of his tail and brush it through. I know people who have done this and their horses tail look awesome. Just watch for allergic reactions. My mare ended up losing hair around her bum from it
3673 2018-07-11 18:12:03 I’m pretty sure your reality skirts alongside of.. oil bad.. but I use it anyway.. And flushing sewage into ocean is ok 
3674 2018-07-11 18:12:02 We are talking about gas not about oil. Nevertheless, russia always delivered the gas reliable. Even while the cold war. No reason for them to shut this trade down.
3675 2018-07-11 18:12:00 Try making a carnation pink work with chili oil!
3676 2018-07-11 18:11:53 Please stop buying oil from OPEC!!
3677 2018-07-11 18:11:52 まだ試合は始まったばかり・・・何が起こるかわかりませんぜ！
3678 2018-07-11 18:11:45 (1/3) Which shouldn't be surprising to anyone who knows that Schröder is the Chairman of Russia's largest oil company (Rosneft)...
3679 2018-07-11 18:11:44 Essential oils! People are “prescribing “ them for everything ranging from sleep to curing cancer. How is rubbing oil on the soles of feet supposed to do anything? Can constantly vaporizing oil into the air cause health problems?
3680 2018-07-11 18:11:40 Rick he pissed Germany off already on camera omg.  He said they don't put their money where their mouth is by using Russia to buy oil from.  Omg omg omg 
3681 2018-07-11 18:11:39 Yeah unless it’s diluted 1-.1% it is toxic!! People are so crazy with these oils these days. I use tea tree oil in my house to repel bugs but I apply it *to my house* - people are out there burning themselves and their babies with oils and shit. Staaaaaaahp
3682 2018-07-11 18:11:39 BBC News - Trump: How much of Germany's gas comes from Russia?AIN'T THIS TREASONOUS LARDAZZ "KOCH"-SUKKA'S BUSINESS ! HIS "BUSINESS" SHOULD BE HERE FINDING OUT WHY IS HIS PHUK'N REPUBLICUNT FINANCIAL & "OIL" CORP "KOCH"-SUKKAS ARE STEALIN' FROM THE "REAL" AMERICAN PEOPLE !!!
3683 2018-07-11 18:11:25 Why is the US not selling gas and oil to Europe? If you are seriously complaining about Germany buying energy from Russia, that could be fixed. But we all know you like seeing those petrodollars flowing into Russia.
3684 2018-07-11 18:11:10  I have some snake oil I’d like to sell you! 
3685 2018-07-11 18:11:08 Was is oil billionaire Lucas Forrest? His dirty fat hands seem to be all over this...
3686 2018-07-11 18:11:07 The Cafe Mac Pizza for lunch today will be: sad crust with greasy coconut oil and arugula.
3687 2018-07-11 18:11:04 You talked me into it. Wish I had some right now! (They just semi-legalized oil for medicinal purposes in Virginia. )
3688 2018-07-11 18:10:53 Crude Oil prints fresh session low at 70.48. #forex #CRUDEOIL
3689 2018-07-11 18:10:52 เป็นอะไรที่เจ็บปวดมากจริงๆค่ะ คงได้แต่คุยกับตัวเองหวีดกับตัวเองไปนะคะ ฮืออออออออออออออออออออออ/เวลามันเร็วล่ะมั้งคะ นี่ก็ยังไม่ได้เขียนฟิคต่อเลยค่ะ ว่าจะเขียนก็เปิดหน้าเวิดไว้แล้วหนีไปเล่นเกม เล่นไปเล่นมาอ้าวตีหนึ่งแล้ว แงงงง 55555555/ใช่ค่ะ! คงได้มีแอนโธจกันหลายเรื่องแน่เลยค่ะ55
3690 2018-07-11 18:10:47 UH THAT COMBINATION..... I cannot. I like salted fish fried in sesame oil on top of my rice.
3691 2018-07-11 18:10:36 A)NG is NOT clean 50% less CO2 then coal/oil with same “other byproducts” its a bridge fuel. B)fracking(NG production) has issues with regard to H20. C)PL is a work around the and many other countries.
D) 70% of  NG can be cut off by. If they get . RU in control
3692 2018-07-11 18:10:27 Fair n lovely now with xtra virgin olive oil...sirf do hafto ki baat
3693 2018-07-11 18:10:26 Not in my house though. Only the urinals at work.
3694 2018-07-11 18:10:26 エルザー　何怒ってんだよー？
3695 2018-07-11 18:10:24 Not to mention, they want us to defend them from the "Evil" of Russia all the while, trusting them with 70% of the oil they need. Sounds like a well thought out extortion scheme on behalf of the EU and Russia.
3696 2018-07-11 18:10:08 君を笑わせるためなら、僕は尻から油を出すよ。
3697 2018-07-11 18:10:05 bien vista el OIL. Cerre el long en 72 y me abrí vendido en 71,8... para recuperar perdidas.
3698 2018-07-11 18:09:59 Using this logic, USA must stop buying oil from Saudi Arabia NOW!Impeach Trump now!
3699 2018-07-11 18:09:58 I had to top up the oil tonight, in natural Alfa fashion. Aside from the odd look from Service Manager, I'm not sure if it was actually the colour I was expecting.
3700 2018-07-11 18:09:58 Palestinians produce olive oil.They need to export it...
3701 2018-07-11 18:09:45 oil
3702 2018-07-11 18:09:43 How much are we paying China for everything?  Or Saudi Arabia?  Even Venezuela for oil? This is just the dumbest comment I’ve ever heard!
3703 2018-07-11 18:09:43 Thank you.  I found only this article of a serious source. Oil was not part of it.
3704 2018-07-11 18:09:40 #LatAmNRG: Oil output from #Ecuador and #Venezuela down, according to OPEC's July 2018 MOMR.

3706 2018-07-11 18:09:36 Hot oil has gotten on my glasses...!
3707 2018-07-11 18:09:27 You can exfoliate your lips once a week by using sugar and olive oil.

3709 2018-07-11 18:09:19 Brent Crude Oil fell by 5% as expectations of growing supplies mounted on news that Libya had reopened their 4 Oil Ports. Oil Production in Libya fell to 527,000 barrels per day (bpd) from 1.30 million bpd in Feb 2018. @arjunparthasara #investorsareidiots
3710 2018-07-11 18:09:17 Is his boosting NATO's defense spending some kind of mask of wishing it to falter?  Is his decrying European use of Russian oil (while shifting to renewables ASAP) another mask of hoping Russia thrives? Without Defense spike we'd be in the doghouse too, but our % isn't funded yet
3711 2018-07-11 18:09:12 So why the pool boy?
3712 2018-07-11 18:08:53 And the US imported over 140,000 barrels of crude oil from Russia last year. How much are we paying for that?
3713 2018-07-11 18:08:52 My oil pen is out and since I got a new job now I have to suffer with no sleep for over a week rip me
3714 2018-07-11 18:08:47 You Dating A black with oil.
3715 2018-07-11 18:08:47 USA could produce more oil just lack pipelines.  Infrastructure and Pipelines and Wall needed badly

3717 2018-07-11 18:08:30 Tell like it is they don't pay their fair share.and buying oil and gas from Russia. Let them take care of themselves pay nothing on nato we don't need them we are nato we the USA are un
3718 2018-07-11 18:08:19 The "healthy change" to Polyunsaturated oil is what has made fries not worth eating for the past few years.
3719 2018-07-11 18:08:14 i burned the fingertips of my right hand w/ cooking oil & now i am typing only w/ my non-dominant hand, good thing i have long fingers, i guess
3720 2018-07-11 18:08:14 And it may STILL keep going :)
3721 2018-07-11 18:08:11 I saw an anti itch spray at petsmart for dogs that had tea tree oil in it! 

I was like...waitaminute! I'm pretty sure I'm not supposed to put that on them!
3722 2018-07-11 18:08:03 We support a stronger NATO and cutting off Russia at the legs, which is what the President's policies would encourage. A more muscular NATO, especially in cyber security, and stop supporting Putin's big industry, which is selling Russian oil.
3723 2018-07-11 18:08:01 thought getting my oil changed at walmart would be a good idea but apparently it’s also 8 million dollars here
3724 2018-07-11 18:07:53     Germany gets 35% of their oil/gas from Russia. It in NO way is owned by Russia. Trump is trying to get Germany to buy Natural Gas from the US. so rattling the cage. Trump is also threatening Nato with auto tariffs. Hell of a way to negotiate, orange face clown. 
3725 2018-07-11 18:07:52 Let's see, GERMANY fails to meet required NATO minimum monetary investment. GERMANY is making deals with RUSSIA to buy more RUSSIAN OIL to include a direct oil pipeline and POTUS factually states both issues are wrong. BUT, you claim POTUS is more loyal to Putin than NATO.
3726 2018-07-11 18:07:46 You have the oil ready @jabberjode 
3727 2018-07-11 18:07:39 NYFed/Treasury Goon Squad turned loose on oil today after biggest draw since 2016. It won't last since those futures contracts don't burn very well in an Internal Combustion Engine. Fed keeping economy on life support (low oil) their biggest fear is a real economic recovery.
3728 2018-07-11 18:07:39 Oil oversold has some minor support 70-70.5 then 68-68.5 below that ultimately heading there. $CL_F
3729 2018-07-11 18:07:27 Oil getting Monkey-hammered, now down $3 on the day after a huge (-12 million barrel) crude inventory decline $CL 
3730 2018-07-11 18:07:26 This was one reason for the disagreements yesterday at Trumps mtg with them. He knows Merkle is getting oil from Russia thru a straight oil line I believe I read this morning. Who was it that decided Russia couldn't be part of G8 Summit?
3731 2018-07-11 18:07:24 China gets 20% of its oil from Iran and Russia
3732 2018-07-11 18:07:16 For this I dont agree with you Mr President. No country is self sustain. We sell and buy from each other. Even greater American do so to Gulf countries(oil). If not Russia who else will supply gas to Germans. Would US do?
3733 2018-07-11 18:07:12 These oil paintings by Lloyd Wilson really capture the beauty of the Canadian landscapes in Ontario. :)
3734 2018-07-11 18:07:06 Actually, we have a maximum taxable limit on oil and gas which puts us in the bottom when it comes to oil and gas taxation in the US. 

We only charge tax on $18 per barrel, but the price is sometimes over $100! That's $82 per barrel tax free!
3735 2018-07-11 18:07:06 By purchasing Putin's gas & oil Germany & France are financing Putin's global military aggression while sticking it to the all other NATO allies especially the Eastern European countries & the US whom they use as a cheap hedging strategy re Putin.

3739 2018-07-11 18:06:47 Now its time to get my oil changed
3740 2018-07-11 18:06:47 It’s also pretty much the entire period when 100s of billions in oil wealth went south.
3741 2018-07-11 18:06:40 Ya because Neo Liberal colonization , the drug war, the right wing and big oil have nothing to do with it.
3742 2018-07-11 18:06:32 So your okay with our tax dollars going to help defend Germany and the EU while they prop up the Russian economy buying oil and gas from Russia? That’s really your stance? OK. @drwright4congr1
3743 2018-07-11 18:06:26 Putin's investment is paying off. Instead of actually passing sanctions to stop gas and oil purchases from Russia. Trump uses this to trivialize and demean NATO and Germany. #leavetheparty #breakfree
3744 2018-07-11 18:06:23 oil 5% down

3749 2018-07-11 18:06:14 Turned on the tv in my bar today, not paying any attention to what is on.  Then in the middle of lunch rush I look up and see 2 chicks oil wrestling on Jerry Springer and my manger is scolding me.  

Olive Garden....a family restaurant.
3750 2018-07-11 18:06:09 Oh then Tim Hortons must’ve removed all of their outlets in the massive oil worker camps in Fort McMurray too?
3751 2018-07-11 18:06:07 Do your research UK not Scotland’s revenue 2017 to 2018 £1.188 million & will increase, provided oil prices remain above the $70 a barrel, then again oil prices are controlled by world markets
3752 2018-07-11 18:05:57 Woman All The Archives: Martin Shkreli Faces Rough Stay In The Oil In 2016 Election Win A Mystery How
3753 2018-07-11 18:05:47 If you believe that Russia is a threat after annexing Crimea and engaging in a proxy war in Ukraine, you should welcome the President's calls for NATO to become more muscular and to cut off Putin's biggest industry by stop consuming Russian oil.  This will weaken Putin.
3754 2018-07-11 18:05:47 You are such a cro-magnon light weight, why should they buy oil and gas from the real state sponsor of world terrorism and finance Russia rather than from the US or other non hostile nations?  It ain’t nuclear physics!
3755 2018-07-11 18:05:45 Last night I dreamed that the recipe for making #Trump was 1 cup white mice, 1 cup of mayonnaise, and that industrial orange popcorn oil.
3756 2018-07-11 18:05:44 You don’t feel like the oil makes you...oilier? I am shiny af already.
3757 2018-07-11 18:05:39 He is lying again. Russia supplies 10 to 15% of Germany’s oil. He won’t use facts. Stop him. Pompeo is complicit.
3758 2018-07-11 18:05:37 ออยตัวติดเกมเลยค่ะ แต่เล่นพวกเกมออนไลน์ที่ต้องใช้ฝีมือมากกว่าใช้ดวงสุ่มตัวละครนะคะ รู้สึกมันไม่ค่อยได้เล่นอะไรเท่าไหร่อ่ะค่ะ 55555555/ไม่ค่อยได้ดูแคสเกมเหมือนกันค่ะ ดูแต่ที่เขาแข่งๆกันก็พอ ถถถถ/จริงค่ะ ยิ่งที่อันนาหลุดจากคำสาปได้เพราะเอลซ่ายิ่งแบบ อห เรือพุ่งไปค่ะ 55555555555
3759 2018-07-11 18:05:32 Time to pay "fair share"? For what?
For support US interrests in the oil states and Ukraine?
For supporting cold war against RU and CN?

Time for US to pay the damages of their policy, including the costs for the hosted refugees in Europe.
3760 2018-07-11 18:05:30 oi oil ioiiioiiii ITS COMING HOMEEEEEEEEEEEEEE YES TRIPPIER
3761 2018-07-11 18:05:18 — SUGAR
mix a tablespoon of raw sugar with some almond oil and a few drops of lemon juice. apply it on the stretch marks . rub the mixture on the skin for a few minutes every day before taking a shower. do this for a month or so and watch your stretch marks become lighter.
3762 2018-07-11 18:05:07 Riddle me this: Why haven't you imposed sanctions against buying Russian oil and gas?
3763 2018-07-11 18:05:02 Working overtime today, world markets sunk, oil down 4% but hey the SPX is a bargain lol
3764 2018-07-11 18:04:58 I still have acne at 52 and rosacea. I use organic argan oil.
3765 2018-07-11 18:04:51 I'm on an oil rig in the North Sea, you're gonna have to keep me updated on this !
3766 2018-07-11 18:04:47 Brent oil down 5.8%
3767 2018-07-11 18:04:46 I bet Andrea Merkel is looking into buying oil from other countries besides Russia, Putin can thank his BFF Trump for the loss of business #NATO
3768 2018-07-11 18:04:45 It's cheaper than putting gas, oil, registration, insurance, tires and a/c in the car.. nigga ride that Horse!
3769 2018-07-11 18:04:45 So military alliances are for obtaining cheap oil and gas? Finally, an honest answer!
3770 2018-07-11 18:04:43 But if the average CCW had done such a thing....
3771 2018-07-11 18:04:43 $CL Did Gartman go long oil yesterday?
3772 2018-07-11 18:04:42 enjoying the consensus that norway is definitely not socialism despite nationalizing its oil industry so its success should not be regarded as a reflection of socialism, but venezuela definitely is because it nationalized its oil industry so its problems are def. on socialism
3773 2018-07-11 18:04:41 1972 Heath's wage-price policy pushes inflation up & the OPEC Oil crisis 1974 cause global recession due hyperinflation. Later 1975 Lib/Lab voted in to clear up the Tory mess. 1979 Nazi Thatcher brainwashed the illiterate & gullible with Tory Nazi propaganda it was Labour fault.
3774 2018-07-11 18:04:40 How many TREASURY BONDS have we sold to CHINA? How much do WE NEED Iran and your "bud" King Salmon for oil? FYI while you were on AF1, the SENATE 97-2 REAFFIRMED the U.S. commitment to NATO.
3775 2018-07-11 18:04:40 Why do we enter wars?Well originally it was because of the commies. Now it’s for oil. When will the American people realize we need to be off fossil fuel’s. If we’re going to save this planet and the people on it.
3776 2018-07-11 18:04:35 IOCs & petro-state interests are not necessarily aligned just bc they both produce oil. Large corps like Exxon actually support carbon taxes & most regulation bc they have the wealth & resources to deal with it. Small corps don’t. This reduces competition from the little guys
3777 2018-07-11 18:04:30 — CASTOR OIL
apply castor oil to the stretch marks and massage the area in circular motions for 5-10 minutes. wrap the area with a thin, cotton cloth. using a hot water bottle or a heating pad, apply some heat to the area for at least a half an hour. repeat this process daily
3778 2018-07-11 18:04:27 How true, even just to see how much oil it has just dropped
3779 2018-07-11 18:04:22 got called baby by one of the oil change people today lads

3787 2018-07-11 18:03:50 Mgbati mgbati obe ata obe oil 
3788 2018-07-11 18:03:49 Where do you buy your oil from?
3789 2018-07-11 18:03:49 Unfortunately, most of Europe has no choice but to get their gas from Russia. Maybe if you was to pay for a pipeline to run from the USA, then the USA could sell their gas and oil to Europe.
3790 2018-07-11 18:03:49 and the United States  buys oil from Saudi Arabia  and China  holds most of US government bonds.   So who is in control of United States?  @POTUS @nikkihaley @SecPompeo @KellyannePolls @PressSec
3791 2018-07-11 18:03:46 So... should Germany be buying oil and gas from America? Oil and gas distribution is kind of a proximity thing ...
3792 2018-07-11 18:03:46 Speaking of the filthy tar sands oil, we don't want it or need it. and certainly don't want your keystone pipeline snaking across our country leaking it all out over the breadbasket of America.  Just sayin'...  And there was that CA additive that was in our gas, polluting our H2O
3793 2018-07-11 18:03:41 WOW, well we'll see who u call when now u need oil and regime changes!
3794 2018-07-11 18:03:40 It raises an interesting concept re: ancient regime but the argument doesnt hold up when it comes to carbon taxes, big oil companies & petro-states. It’s too grand & sweeping & assumes all oil producers fall into the same category and have the same interests, which they don’t.
3795 2018-07-11 18:03:39 Oil prices plunge $3 a barrel on Libya reopening ports, US-China trade tensions
3796 2018-07-11 18:03:34 Send the Fisheries some of the Alberta oil 
3797 2018-07-11 18:03:22 In fact Russia supplies Germany with 10% to 15% of it’s oil. He is lying.

3803 2018-07-11 18:02:37 “Tried”
3804 2018-07-11 18:02:34 I cannot do any oil whatsoever. I have learned this the hard way! But maybe when my skin eventually gives up the oil glands... heh.
3805 2018-07-11 18:02:32 Cruz loses just by standing next to Beto, which is why he won’t debate. Cruz looks like a smarmy snake oil salesman, while Beto looks like a trusted Jimmy Stewart type.
3806 2018-07-11 18:02:31 Now I need an oil change. Fasho have a coupon for that too 
3807 2018-07-11 18:02:29 We're like oil and water, never meant to be together
Just strangers to each other
We're like rock and scissors, where one beats the other
Oh, no matter what
We are strangers to each other, strangers to each other 
3808 2018-07-11 18:02:11 Doesn't the USA buy oil from Russia? What the heck does that have to do with NATO? You're a disgrace to your office.
3809 2018-07-11 18:02:06 Well, Germany imported 91.1 million tons of crude oil, and Russia was their largest supplier in 2016, delivering 36 million tons, or almost 40 percent of oil imports, sort of sounds like they are. Just like the US and Saudi Arabia
3810 2018-07-11 18:02:06 We protect Germany from who? Russia? . . . With trade, oil/gas dependence with Russia, Germany is probably an ally. . . . We are stupid to pay our enemies to attack us with their allies. . . . How dumb is that?
3811 2018-07-11 18:02:06 Swear I love changing my own oil and driving my car likes it’s brand new
3812 2018-07-11 18:01:49 Trump bombs Syria who Putin supports, levies harsh sanctions on Russia, has enacted policies for US to become largest oil producer which hurts Russia & fake media pretends Trump is in cahoots w Russia, but Trump calls out Germany for buying Russian oil & fake media cries abt it.

3817 2018-07-11 18:01:34 But 40% of their oil comes from Russia...you changed "oil" to "energy" to make it look like its less...
3818 2018-07-11 18:01:30 And Saudi oil imports to US up 50%.
3819 2018-07-11 18:01:25 Trump is correct again...Germany gave up their coal and nuclear energy and are totally dependent on Russian oil..
3820 2018-07-11 18:01:18 If only it were oil.

3823 2018-07-11 18:01:18 #Germany shouldn't be so dependent on Russia's gas and oil. And they should contribute 2 percent to #NATO. Not the miserly 1.2 percent they do now.

3829 2018-07-11 18:00:46 India’s monthly oil imports from Iran declined by 16% (M-o-M) due to sanctions imposed by USA on Iran. Due to India’s higher dependency on Oil will put Indian Oil refirners to search for more Seismic Zones in India. @arjunparthasara #investorsareidiots
3830 2018-07-11 18:00:36 Well then it makes her oil & gas deal particularly stupid. Funding an enemy oligarchy is bad enough, she thinks she's funding an enemy nation which has fully siezed the means of production.

3857 2018-07-11 17:59:10 Germany is doing a sweetheart deal with Putin and under the table of Nato for oil. Which means if push comes to shove who will they side with. Russia can cut them off and their economy collapses. They will soon be on Russia's side. Nato was formed to fight Russia.
3858 2018-07-11 17:59:04 The best way I've found is to put the fries in with the oil on low and gradually ramp it up.
3859 2018-07-11 17:58:59 Parut dah pudar. It's mean bio essence punya oil tu berkesan 
3860 2018-07-11 17:58:57 Even though the US knows Saudi Arabia helped in the 9/11 attacks they still supply the Saudis with weapons and purchase massive amounts of oil from them.
Care to explain how this is better?

3862 2018-07-11 17:58:53 Germany DID sign a huge oil/gas deal which funds Russia & makes Germany more dependent on Russia.

Germany DOESN'T meet their NATO obligations, Germany is failing to even meet their weaksauce 2014 promise.

That's not gaslighting, it's just stating facts.

otherwise lower to burn all the longs on one side of the boat
3890 2018-07-11 17:57:01 What did the President say that wasn't true? Germany can't say Russia is a threat and they need American participation in NATO for protection out of one side of their mouth, then defend the Billions in profits they give Russia from the oil pipeline with other side.
#factsmatter
3891 2018-07-11 17:56:58 So Putin wants the President to encourage more spending on NATO, thus giving the organization more muscle in the face of Russia, and encouraging NATO countries (see Germany) to stop propping up Putin's vital industry by not handing over billions of dollars for oil. Interesting.
3892 2018-07-11 17:56:50 The only way sanctions work. Is if you are trading already with the country you're putting sanctions on. If no one traded with Russia how can you sanction them? Getting Germany to stop buying their gas and oil is to pass sanctions. We're pushing that in Iran. Why not Russia?
3893 2018-07-11 17:56:45 i think i had just not let the oil heat up enough, and had it set a little too low for the first try.

3896 2018-07-11 17:56:36 Yeah. Putin’s puppet. That’s why he is telling Germany that depending on Russia for 70% of their oil is a bad idea. C’mon Joe. You are better than that!

3924 2018-07-11 17:54:15 I’m not a Trump fan, but he has a point. Germany is utterly at the mercy of Russia for its crude oil because Germany failed to plan for energy needs as France did with its nuclear power.
3925 2018-07-11 17:54:12 40% of its oil comes from Russia.

Oil makes up 34.6% of Germany's energy use.

Still doesn't add up to dependence.

What's hilarious is that Trump thinks Russia is great, and Germany's "dependence" on Russia is a problem.

He's either an idiot, gaslighting, or both.

3933 2018-07-11 17:53:58 It seemed to say we pay to protect you, you don’t pay your fair share and yet you buy gas and oil from a mutual enemy... So which side of your mouth does the Europeans want to talk from?
3934 2018-07-11 17:53:57 @realDonaldTrump called a spade a spade.  Germany pays hundreds billions of dollars /yr to Russia for 60% of its oil/gas needs via a pipeline.  Then Germany wants the US to pay for protecting from Russia's domination.  Hello! Do you understand how greedy and twisted Germany is?
3935 2018-07-11 17:53:54 Really. Wake up .  Someday perhaps but right now and for the foreseeable future oil is king and pipelines are the only safe form of transport and most of these clowns are being paid to protest and couldn’t give to shits about the land #truth

I guess not always clear what the adjective is describing.

3995 2018-07-11 17:50:33 Meanwhile, the Germans are buying oil from the very communist nation that spurred the formation of NATO in the first place! @realDonaldTrump rocks!
3996 2018-07-11 17:50:17 Actually very little if any oil at all comes from them. 40% is our own and the other 60 is from Saudi Arabia, Canada and Latin America
3997 2018-07-11 17:50:06 Quit lip balms-they consist wax, hence ensuring your life long commitment to them. As soon as you  withdraw chapped lips so you continue using. Natural things like borolin/oil on navel etc - permanent solutions!
3998 2018-07-11 17:50:05 They've COMPLETELY missed his point about energy.  Energy is national security.  It transcends the trade talks.  Example.  I can do without cheap Chinese knick knacks and picture frames; that's trade.  China cannot do without our oil and natural gas.
3999 2018-07-11 17:50:04 If he is, why is he specifically telling Europe to NOT buy Russian oil?
Do you listen to yourself?
4000 2018-07-11 17:50:03 And you’re telling us the US spent all that for NATO and not in other countries where they changed governments that they needed to get oil out of or in countries where they changed the direction of the existing governments and put in their own puppets! US used to fight evil!

4003 2018-07-11 17:49:58 Russia is back as a Totalitarian Government, the elections are a sham, Trump calls the oil from Russia, "Putin's Oil" making Germany owned. So at least they are admitting that Russia is not a free country with free industry.

4011 2018-07-11 17:49:07 Imagine sister. This guy killed Gaddafi, murdered Osama Bin laden over some fabricated theories. Just because they need his oil. I don't wanna lie. Obama is the enemy to black people so is Thuma mina. This is going to benefit their Israel masters nje qha

4013 2018-07-11 17:49:07 Auto/oil lobbyism is the reason we're so far behind on transit. Even though we're playing catch-up now, things just move so slowly. Construction and permitting is expensive and the money usually isn't there.
4014 2018-07-11 17:49:04 Or any government job...
4015 2018-07-11 17:48:54 We the USA pay Russia for gas and oil. The AGREEMENT is to be at 2% by 2024. We choose to spend so much on our military!  The cost and effect of NATO is more than just monetary.
4016 2018-07-11 17:48:53 Hahaha I meant like it’s even harder to take care of a long beard! With how much oil you need to buy and use, how many times a day you need to brush it or comb it, and how you need to wash it and keep it styled and conditioned...
4017 2018-07-11 17:48:45 Back in the day, when more people smoked, I did a college paper on the tendency of male urinators to propel butts around the bowl. Based on Stanford study.
4018 2018-07-11 17:48:41 Gabon oil workers start 15-days strike at Total facilities: Gabon oil workers’union ONEP launched a 15-days strike at the facilities of French oil producer Total on monday, after its demands for higher salaries and other issues were not met.@bbcafrique @CNNAfrica @ABC @voxafrica
4019 2018-07-11 17:48:40 @Nestle won’t be touching any of your products until you sort out your palm oil situation
4020 2018-07-11 17:48:31 I am trying to figure out how they have been such a great allies when we fought against them in two world wars???  And we have to military bases there protecting them from Russia? Then they turn around and buy oil from them? How does that seem right to anyone?

4022 2018-07-11 17:48:25 Maybe bluster for faster 2%, or 4% & don't buy oil from Russia, that's a mask to show he's not cozy with Putin, militarily/economically?  But we wouldn't be boasting (complaining?) 3.9% without Mattis getting the huge boost in our Defense budget, NOT YET funded, oh taxpayers.
4023 2018-07-11 17:48:18 Where’s all the oil we were promised ?
4024 2018-07-11 17:48:16 It's not about buying Russian oil, but why they are not buying American oil. Once again it is all about American Big Oil companies. Keep those donors happy!
4025 2018-07-11 17:48:14 Should we forget how many dollars were paid by the US to crooked states for oil? The argument against Germany is a laugh.
4026 2018-07-11 17:48:13 Oil is created into plastic. End tar sand and kinder Morgan. Economy is renewable sustainable energies
4027 2018-07-11 17:48:07 Oil futures down $3  (4%)
4028 2018-07-11 17:48:01 I think I may send some oil blends bc she really likes aromatherapy. And maybe I will make a herb/oil/crystal essence/elixir for her when I make the ones for my friends.
4029 2018-07-11 17:47:59 Think of the big picture. Climate change and urban pollution are literally killing millions. Oil companies are guilty of corporate manslaughter. Deliberate negligence at best.
Put in that perspective then Musk is a saint.
4030 2018-07-11 17:47:43 And the oil stays on everything so not serving only on flights with an allergy or not serving in buffer rows is a joke.
4031 2018-07-11 17:47:39 It was a good run for crude oil and even showed strength on the last bout of tariffs, but this is on another level. Getting dragged with everything today and broke my support at 72.14. Rough day for bulls.
4032 2018-07-11 17:47:39 The USA buys oil from Iran, are we allies of Iran and owned by them.. no.. Trump is an idiot.
4033 2018-07-11 17:47:37 They had that Libyan oil money bruh lol Masry ninjas poor asf can't run businesses like y'all 
4034 2018-07-11 17:47:30 Unfortunately Palestine doesn't  have oil, otherwise the US govt would certainly mount a retaliatory offensive under the guise of justice and democracy
4035 2018-07-11 17:47:30 थोड़े दिनों बाद indian oil और हिंदुस्तान पेट्रोलियम भी बन्द हो कर पेट्रोल सिर्फ रिलायंस पेट्रोल पंप पर बिका करेगा #BikGayiGormint
4036 2018-07-11 17:47:29 Bit over the top this #oil move surely ! #Brent #WTI Down 5.5% so far .
4037 2018-07-11 17:47:25 Our water is under threat from fossil fuel pollution, why have you refused to reject campaign contributions from Big Oil? #nofossilfuelmoney
4038 2018-07-11 17:47:24 Hmm look into Murray’s beeswax and Argan oil edge control.
4039 2018-07-11 17:47:23 healthy rotation, maybe they finally figured out more tariff's less oil required
4040 2018-07-11 17:47:22 In my heart I now lust for a pretty little juki industrial straight stitch with the oil well and all - but honestly even one of those isn’t as expensive as some home models
4041 2018-07-11 17:47:22 If it’s stuffy, my nose is terrible at smelling. 

(Also: yes if you get a nasty oil in there I think? I’d just try to blow my nose a whole bunch, or maybe Nettipot?)
4042 2018-07-11 17:47:18 Everyone who knows me knows I'm a bit obsessed with all things coconut... Okay EXTREMELY obsessed with coconut. I just bought an entire coconut bath set from PINK. Body wash, Body scrub, body lotion, body oil, face mask, lip scrub, and lip oil, and bath bomb. All coconut scented
4043 2018-07-11 17:47:17 The US must be controlled by Canada's oil we get 40% from Canada. What if Canada cuts off the Alaskan pipeline?
4044 2018-07-11 17:47:17 the flavor...of the oil?
4045 2018-07-11 17:47:14 And what makes you think I’m not wealthy? Because I left UPS? lol... I have a very lucrative stock portfolio, family owned 163 acreage farm with 3 oil wells on it that have been producing since 1978... I'm quite wealthy, thanks...
4046 2018-07-11 17:47:13 In this particular clip, I can't disagree with Trump's questioning of allies buying oil from Russia but needing to be protected from them by the US. It does bear stretching out the question for the sake of understanding what is going on.
4047 2018-07-11 17:47:10 i just tried deep frying on the stove for the first time. 
no nothing caught fire
first batch of fries: oversaturated, underdone. turned up heat a bit more. 
second batch of fries, and mozz sticks: super awesome and delicious <3

no special tools, just peanut oil and a pan.
4048 2018-07-11 17:47:10 wait really?!? that means i can redo my knuckles route so i wont time over in oil ocean
4049 2018-07-11 17:47:07 If Russia is such a threat, why would you want to buy one drop of oil from it and help prop up the only real industry that Putin has?
4050 2018-07-11 17:47:01 Salt, black pepper, olive oil. Enjoy!
4051 2018-07-11 17:46:52 Just talked to Muva in law. She’s about to get a nice little package. She’s sending the boys home with whipped shea infused with essential oil. She said she had never thought to do it until we had talked about it. I’m hella excited.
4052 2018-07-11 17:46:51 This tidbit is probably the most important. Putin's sucking everyone on the oil deals w/Rosneft. Putin's going to rip up Antarctica for oil. Does he want AK? This is all abt money & DT wants 2b as wealthy as Putin. We've privatized entire US economy..almost. RU is coming...
4053 2018-07-11 17:46:39 No worries your sending motor oil I'm sending urine samples from an aids clinic.
4054 2018-07-11 17:46:38 Black women really be a blessing on breezy summer afternoons. shining all gold & bronze & beautiful. smelling like coconut oil, shea butter, hopes & dreams. I love us so much
4055 2018-07-11 17:46:35 leo keeps screaming every time he touches oil... isn't he a mechanic?
4056 2018-07-11 17:46:23 Well, the biggest supplier of American oil is...America.

So I guess America controls America.
4057 2018-07-11 17:46:23 Pescatarian keto is def doable. You'd just have to add your own fat to a lot of it, like butter, ghee, olive oil, coconut oil, etc.
4058 2018-07-11 17:46:23 But Trump pointed out that by relying on Russia for oil, you are not independent. See the irony?
4059 2018-07-11 17:46:23 Germany gets less than 15% of its energy needs from Russia. The United States gets more than 15% of its oil from Canada. @realDonaldTrump does that mean we are controlled by Canada?  (Of course more & more of us wish we were, but that's another thing ...)
4060 2018-07-11 17:46:21 We import oil from countries involved in 9/11, fund terrorism,  etc. are we any different?
We're captives of countries that have vowed to destroy us & Israel.
Israel gets its oil from Russia & former Soviet republics & yet we pump billions $ to Israel in foreign aid.
4061 2018-07-11 17:46:20 I woke up
Am grateful
Did yoga
Drank water
Drank tea
Took meds
Got a good night's sleep
Talked to a friend

Been listening to music
Feeling peaceful

Need to meditate
Meds are working
Did pushups
Need to eat
It's going to be a nice day:)

4062 2018-07-11 17:46:15 Let's see; we have almost no more allies, N. Korea is laughing at us along with the rest of the world; the oil tarrifs are going to raise oil prices to $50 A barrel raising gas prices; the tarrifs on cars, aluminum & steel is already costing jobs (see Harley Davidson).
4063 2018-07-11 17:46:14 Germany is buying oil and gas from Russia. Why? Because it's close by and they have a lot of it. If they didn't buy it from Russia, where would you suggest they get it? The US buys tons of goods from China. Is the US allied with China? My God, you are so stupid.
4064 2018-07-11 17:46:13 Good call! I asked about the Quid Pro Quo last night when story of Collusion broke. This is why Trump attacking NATO, Allies and criticized Germany over consumption of Putin’s oil! Trump said Putin at least 5 times in one babbling run on sentence!
4065 2018-07-11 17:46:11 The U.S. also buys oil from Russia.
4066 2018-07-11 17:46:11 British Petroleum dumped millions of gallons of crude oil into the ocean but I have to give up straws because they're bad for the environment.
4067 2018-07-11 17:46:09 Try taking some fish oil! It can help lessen the intensity of the zaps!
4068 2018-07-11 17:46:07 What’s the difference between CBD oil and Hemp oil. My doctors office had their own CBD oil I was buying it wasn’t working. I got a Hemp oil dietary supplement on Amazon. It works much better.
4069 2018-07-11 17:46:05 Man y’all that wild growth oil works cause when I tell youboyyyyy y’all will be amazed how fast the shit work
4070 2018-07-11 17:46:04 My children are too old for formula now.
I feed them exclusively on avocados and coconut oil these days.
4071 2018-07-11 17:46:00 He sliced it so thin it would liquefy in the pan with just a little oil
4072 2018-07-11 17:46:00 Boy I just seen this shit on snap this dude said “happy 710, if you didn’t know 710 flipped upside down is oil with is dabs so happy dab day” y’all really come up with the stupidest shit just to smoke.

4074 2018-07-11 17:45:59 Apparently coconut oil and / or an egg mask helps  x
4075 2018-07-11 17:45:57 What do you bet that this Trump #NATOSummit line about Germany's double standard, paying for Russian Gas and Oil, and not spending enough on absurdly expensive US manufactured arms, is something he was told by Putin?
4076 2018-07-11 17:45:52 As to Merkel that has struck a deal with Russia for oil?
4077 2018-07-11 17:45:52 Its wrong though. Most of our oil is just that ours and not Canadas so how do they know this when its wrong?
4078 2018-07-11 17:45:52 My hair is so curly, I need a good oil for it tho
4079 2018-07-11 17:45:50 Idk where my hair would be without coconut oil it’s so good for everything
4080 2018-07-11 17:45:49 Has Roy Keane accidentally boiled his head in a vat of oil or has the contrast on my telly gone whack? #ENGCRO
4081 2018-07-11 17:45:44 And as shale gas production increased, there was less need for oil
4082 2018-07-11 17:45:41 Had my last anointing w/ oil in Manggahan for now, naiiyak ako kanina, ilang taon din na sa manggahan ako inanoint, the ff years, ang Panginoon na ang bahala. Basta anong mangyari, JIL Manggahan, you are my home 
4083 2018-07-11 17:45:35 It’s like VVIX is paying attention to oil, the snow and headline risk, but VIX is saying, “yeah, but GOOGL, AMZN, FB, MSFT, and JPM are all green.
4084 2018-07-11 17:45:20 *government
4085 2018-07-11 17:45:10 Aaaaaahhhhh! So you think that oil is still raking in billions of £ in tax, it's just that it's being stolen by Westminster!

Oh dear.... what a shame.
4086 2018-07-11 17:45:10 If i wasn't in oil and gas i would  certainly  be working in #aviation industry. I just love the mechanics of  flight.
4087 2018-07-11 17:45:09 Water and fucking oil (Rubs temple)
4088 2018-07-11 17:45:00 So, he’s actually wanting Germany to NOT buy all their oil from Russia because they are making Putin more powerful.
And that is being on Putin’s side? #NATOSummit
4089 2018-07-11 17:44:58 Meanwhile, you need to do something about the hoops we need to jump thru and the cost of medical marijuana in NYS. (Oil or pills). Not a cure. Not even a treatment.  But it helps with the pain right now.
4090 2018-07-11 17:44:58 So why isn't Germany buying our oil and gas instead of Russia?? Merkel and her government get a check?? Sure looks like it
4091 2018-07-11 17:44:56 Germany mostly uses Natural GAS. and Russia only supplies 40% of Germany’s Oil needs. 

45s tantrum is a ruse. #FakeNews 

The Senate passed a resolution (97-2) against his idiotic attack against #NATO and the House is about to do the same.  
They are a Co-Equal Branch!
4092 2018-07-11 17:44:55 What good is Germany without gas and energy?
(on same note:
How good is the US with without imports of oil etc?)
How does trade with non-NATO neighbors (you know that market thing that everybody's done since beginning of time) mess up NATO?
Please make more sense going forward.

4100 2018-07-11 17:44:28 “i don’t like coconut oil. we have 2 jars in our house and one of them is used for lube so it’s not something i can trust”
4101 2018-07-11 17:44:27 Well, that's precisely why Russia is intent on selling more and more of its oil & gas to China (and is building the required infrastructure), isn't it? Russia seems to have possible alternative clients. Does Germany have possible alternative suppliers?
4102 2018-07-11 17:44:20 Should we forget how many dollars were paid by the US to crooked states for oil? The argument against Germany is a laugh.
4103 2018-07-11 17:44:16 @SONNigeria Good day, i need information on the relevant licences to be obtained before venturing into Lube oil importation and blending operations.

Thank you

4108 2018-07-11 17:43:53 When a new one comes on stream, others are shutting down.

It was in 2014 and it was lucky that the people of Scotland rejected his boasting and bluster.

Heres one more, oil production in the North Sea peaked in 1999, it will never be back at those levels.
4109 2018-07-11 17:43:52 OIL 1D 69.44 area is next stop down from Morning Briefing. So far this is a normal correction lower from WTI 1D chart I did today, but it came after the start of 2nd leg up, early. Also, the largest OIL drawdown in two years came in June, that usually moves price higher???
4110 2018-07-11 17:43:45 There's a wind turbine on every hill in North Dakota, & yet ND is one of the leading producers of natural gas and oil. No matter how many windmills we have they cannot replace natural gas & oil. Cars don't run on air. Even electric cars need electricity that's provided by oil
4111 2018-07-11 17:43:39 Lol he insulted Germany for being Putin’s puppet cause they rely on Russia for oil. We rely on them for nothing. The irony of this tweet
4112 2018-07-11 17:43:35 No I don’t have tanning oil on haha
4113 2018-07-11 17:43:35 The USA imports Iranian oil.  Are we allies of Iran or not?  Energy is not the same thing as any other trading commodity, but you probably aren't smart enough to know this.
4114 2018-07-11 17:43:17 We are loosing our culture in Nigeria "I just saw a guy washing his hand after eating Buns instead of rubbing D oil on his head 
4115 2018-07-11 17:43:08 I came to change the oil in my truck and I think this hot chick with tattoos is about to change it for me 
4116 2018-07-11 17:43:07 Who's buying the oil & gas? What was that pesky Paris Agreement all about? Turns out it was just a talk fest! There's 1 that wants 2 b the saviour but it is giving the world the hump!
4117 2018-07-11 17:43:06 @MaryamNSharif @ShkhRasheed 
PLMN claim of  Electricity which they have generated by oil called THERMAL which is so coslty that USA, China, Saudi Arab can not afford . 

They hand cuffed the nation & surrendered them & handed over the chain  to IMF & world powers & enemies
4118 2018-07-11 17:42:58 Excellent letter and you say everything I feel and believe.  May's great brexit betrayal will never be forgiven or forgotten. Her Project Fear threat of 'it's me or Corbyn' is a load of smoke & mirrors from a snake oil selller. All 3 parties will be unelectable for a generation.
4119 2018-07-11 17:42:57 That new irn bru recipe eh? Pure shite pal okay now that I’ve lost the attention of the English, we attack at 7.01pm. We’re taking back the telephone. We’re taking back the television. Our precious oil. We’re electrifying Hadrian’s wall. This might be our last chance

4121 2018-07-11 17:42:51 Realized today that I’ve had my car for a full 10 years now — still never been in for anything more than regular oil changes, brake pads & general maintenance, nothing major. <27k mi. (43.5k km) I’ve spent <$1k on upkeep in ten years. Love my #Civic. (Had an Accord before @Honda)
4122 2018-07-11 17:42:49 So happy my hair isn’t dead after the bleach yesterday! COCONUT OIL DOES WONDERS LADIES AND GENTS.
4123 2018-07-11 17:42:45 Add to that the ramping up of oil production; pressure Saudi Arabia to pump more oil; etc.
4124 2018-07-11 17:42:43 Anyone still long oil?
4125 2018-07-11 17:42:42 Oil is heterogeneous in grade and quality. USA needs to import heavy sour crude while exporting light sweet. All comes down to what the refineries can process.
4126 2018-07-11 17:42:41 Germany is independent...we get oil from whereever we want.... just like you get  your oil from 9/11 perpetrators ...
4127 2018-07-11 17:42:41 @RayCronise also you say oils are not on the pyramid, would you suggest i stay away from olive oil, flax seed oil? also stay away from things such as peanut butter?
4128 2018-07-11 17:42:41 Given the dubious history of oil cleanup projects, the situation you you describe is probably analogous to selecting an experienced phrenologist to treat your brain aneurysm instead of an inexperienced amateur.
4129 2018-07-11 17:42:40 Yes price of oil is being driven by HFT paper trading using any news for Pavlovian Fade (today Iran Libya) to push price around. But supply demand along with their big brother decline curves never sleeps. Continuing to apply price pressure on oil today only ensures a higher price
4130 2018-07-11 17:42:38 Outta sight, outta mind
4131 2018-07-11 17:42:35 "If Russia truly is a mortal threat, then why buy their gas?"  Yes, and why did Europe cut illegal deals to buy Saddam's oil under the oil-for-food program? Because individuals  can get rich breaking the law that way.
4132 2018-07-11 17:42:24 Trump bombs Syria who Putin supports, levies harsh sanctions on Russia, has enacted policies for US to become largest oil producer which hurts Russia & fake media pretends Trump is in cahoots w Russia, but Trump calls out Germany for buying Russian oil & fake media cries abt it.

4138 2018-07-11 17:42:09 Maybe you don’t get the point that Germany can afford to take on their own defense and full NATO dues if they are going to buy their oil from Russia instead of the USA. The world can make unilateral deals with USA or they can subsidize their own militaries and NATO.
4139 2018-07-11 17:42:06 It's where Trump got his debts to Deutsche Bank paid off RT @ananavarro: Trump tells NATO, Germany is controlled by Russia because that’s from where Germany gets its oil.
Ok, well, by that logic....
Trump is controlled by Russia because that’s from where Trump got his presidency.
4140 2018-07-11 17:42:03 Hello everyone! Happy to work with yous! Just updating one of the vats are not able to reset due to high limit issue. When dropping oil can someone check the probe if it’s okay if not I’ll do a call out. Many thanks!! Kc @kar
4141 2018-07-11 17:41:59 i fuck w coconut oil
4142 2018-07-11 17:41:46 It’s quite funny. I’ve got a underground oil tank I can chuck you in for a few weeks
4143 2018-07-11 17:41:45 Acting new when they run into you
4144 2018-07-11 17:41:37 Of, first it’s Trump voters, then it’s krill oil lovers. Did he also lean in and whisper “it’s just so deliciousssssss”
4145 2018-07-11 17:41:34 
4146 2018-07-11 17:41:33 The thing is, the heartless one always wins.
Without no-fault, the guy who wants to bang his secretary hires a private detective to take pictures of her talking with another guy, blames her for infidelity, and she's on the street with nothing.
either way, the innocent get screwed
4147 2018-07-11 17:41:29 And you may find yourself there again, Angela.  Keep biting Russian oil.
4148 2018-07-11 17:41:26 What good is a president who approves billions of  United States dollars to pay Canada for the dark dirty oil from the Keystone pipeline?  The US is paying protection $$$ to billionaires while allowing tremendous environmental risk.  Must Impeach! @NATO @ClimateAndSecurity
4149 2018-07-11 17:41:21 I mean pretty much all of the oil rich countries are pains in the ass so does it really matter which pain in the ass that Germany is buying from?
4150 2018-07-11 17:41:19 BOOM!!!  Literally struck oil here people!!! This is Spindle Top all over again!
4151 2018-07-11 17:41:15 If I measure my wait time in pages, today's wait for the oil change and repair car was 118 pages long.
4152 2018-07-11 17:41:03 Oh and tar is in California.. I think you meant oil sands... unless you’re a drama queen and enjoy flair over facts
4153 2018-07-11 17:40:47 Had the same exact thought,. Poured some oil out of my lamp for him.
4154 2018-07-11 17:40:43 Except that if they listen and increase their own spending on defense, they will be better protected against Russia. And he also called out Germany and France for feeding off Russia's oil line, and suggested not being captive from it. That's not in Putin's goals.
4155 2018-07-11 17:40:41 Here’s a case where a manual safety might have helped.
4156 2018-07-11 17:40:38 So, the U.S. buys Russian oil, but Germany shouldn't?  What does it have to do with our mutual defense agreement anyhow?  You really don't want any allies, do you?
4157 2018-07-11 17:40:35 Make tempura batter with cbd oil then soak rice in the oil and make a blunt shaped sushi edible
4158 2018-07-11 17:40:32 Not a chance that it can be arrested in Moscow. Nor anywhere else since Cristina Fernández de Kirchner agreed with Iran to cover that story in exchange of lower prices for Iranian oil. Nisman was murdered probably for exposing that secret deal.
4159 2018-07-11 17:40:30 The Hutton Inquiry was a whitewash. Even Michael Howard didn't except the 'suicide scenario' and believed he was murdered. I don't really like using the term Deep State but if you look at some of the characters involved. Eugenics, Arms Trade, War, Oil, Greed- nice group
4160 2018-07-11 17:40:26 チャーリーさん、どーしたんだろうな…
4161 2018-07-11 17:40:21 Too bad they use coconut oil in it though but very tasty
4162 2018-07-11 17:40:16 This essential oil blend I diffused in my room got me feelin like a flower goddess 
4163 2018-07-11 17:40:08 i believe he offered to help in Thailand. Just as he did in PR. he's trying to get us off the oil teat that causes a large portion of the global crises we endure. He's one of the finest examples of mankind we've produced - ridiculous that people would rip him.
4164 2018-07-11 17:40:07 泣いてなんかいないよ、これは心の油だ。
4165 2018-07-11 17:40:05 not chopping it, slicing it very thin, so it liquefies in the pan with just a little oil
4166 2018-07-11 17:40:04 Its the UKs oil, stop being so parochial.

As for the deficit, you cant blame the UK for that.

One thing for sure is, if independent, how would you reduce it?

If you cant explain how, its pointless listening to you greeting about it.
4167 2018-07-11 17:39:55 How Germany gets Oil from it's Pipeline is NONE of your Business. Having an Ally on the Eastern Bloc is your Business. Please don't f$ck everything up. #NATO
4168 2018-07-11 17:39:53 And Germany needs to buy all of its oil and gas from US not Russia anymore 
4169 2018-07-11 17:39:52 Wow..even after a negligent discharge of his firearm. Incredible. 
4170 2018-07-11 17:39:45 Start reducing oil prices or expect demand to sink, India warns OPEC.
4171 2018-07-11 17:39:41 “Finding the urge to ask her out is like trying to get oil from a water spout”
4172 2018-07-11 17:39:37 Donald I wish to goodness that our politicians would think of our Farmers & Fishermen. Instead they are quite happy for our fishermen to loose their quotas to every other country in the EU and the farmers to allow their fields to lie fallow or grow oil seed rape
4173 2018-07-11 17:39:36 Y’all microwave y’all coconut oil before applying it ?
4174 2018-07-11 17:39:35 The US buys gas and oil from other countries, what's your point?
4175 2018-07-11 17:39:31 OIL = USD strong
4176 2018-07-11 17:39:30 that's not what happened, hillary met some french business interests who wanted libya's oil and gold so they killed gadaffi and xfered the armory to syria. This is while Iran and NK watch a country who signed a demilitarization pledge get knocked off making it harder
4177 2018-07-11 17:39:24 Question and answer leave the oil in the sand.
4178 2018-07-11 17:39:21 Interesting, a castor oil pack!
4179 2018-07-11 17:39:19 If POTUS was in Putin's pocket, he would be calling for them to REDUCE military spending and not INCREASE due to Russian aggression, thus making them more vulnerable. And he would be encouraging those countries to sign oil deals with Russia to prop up Putin's big industry.
4180 2018-07-11 17:39:16 Germany will keep being invaded by Muslims. The german nationals will lose sovereignty while chaos develops within their borders. When things are fully ripe Putin will shutdown oil to Germany and the Russians will walk in and claim the land they wanted in WWII.
4181 2018-07-11 17:39:10 tanning oil>> sunscreen
4182 2018-07-11 17:39:08 When Trump increased sanctions, pressures countries to NOT buy Russian oil, gas, weapons et al, it's misdirection and actually proves, Trump is a Russian agent? Riiight. You have your narrative all worked out there, bro. Heads: Trump is a Russian. Tails: Trump is a Russian agent.
4183 2018-07-11 17:39:03 Fair point but at a time when high oil prices are putting pressure on the current account and the currency, it is not a bad thing to export as many services as possible
4184 2018-07-11 17:38:57 Dear @NATO, moral Americans are grateful for you coming to our aid after 9/11, even though our government attacked the wrong country for the wrong reasons (oil). Thank you...I apologize to all NATO allies for our ignorant, dishonest, cowardly @realDonaldTrump @tedlieu @Ocasio2018
4185 2018-07-11 17:38:47 Crude Oil prints fresh session low at 71.18. #forex #CRUDEOIL
4186 2018-07-11 17:38:40 That's why the Left pushed for No Fault.
"Let's not quibble and argue about who killed who. Give me the kids and 1/3rd your salary for the next 14 years while I move in with my new rich husband, cuz spouse income doesn't count in the child support calculations!"
4187 2018-07-11 17:38:36 Was it too unexpected for #oil that Saudis hiked production by 400K or it's Iran rocking the boat with its "pump as much as possible" strategy? #US inventories -12K huge drop by no impact on oil

4189 2018-07-11 17:38:28 Where’s the best place to get an oil change here in Fairbanks?
4190 2018-07-11 17:38:22 Kalo cleansing oilnya pake face oil kayak kleveru gitu bisa ga ya kira"? Beli cleansing oil dimana ya mbak?
4191 2018-07-11 17:38:22  Awesome. I’ve actually been to the Waterford factory, in Ireland.
4192 2018-07-11 17:38:10 Then why did you bringing in Tillerson from Exon to try and broker an Arctic oil deal with Russia?
4193 2018-07-11 17:38:06 Fascinating interview with @cjenscook. I found myself wondering if the financialized oil contracts are being leveraged and replacing mbs instruments in the EuroDollar dark maze. @JeffSnider_AIP ?
4194 2018-07-11 17:38:06 The thing is Canada isn’t Russia. Canada has free elections without rigging but Russia rigs their elections and puts down any protests. So what if they get their oil from Canada? Nothing wrong like getting it from Putin
4195 2018-07-11 17:38:01 Thank you! Much appreciated Glad you enjoyed it, and please steer clear of cod liver oil! 
4196 2018-07-11 17:37:56 Why does the United States have multiple investments from China? Why was the US buying oil from Venezuela? Why does your daughter and you manufacture your products in China?
these are the questions that Americans want answered.
4197 2018-07-11 17:37:49 I drove my brother to court this morning so I’m making him buy me oil to pay me back
4198 2018-07-11 17:37:44 Wow. Your Ignorance is ASTOUNDING. You claim to be a "Foreign Affairs News Chief" and are unaware that Nord Stream 2 is a co-op project between Russia and Germany to supply them with 75% of their oil. What better way for them to be "captive to Russia" Andrea ???
4199 2018-07-11 17:37:42 As a natural I feel you shouldn't go out spending $$$ on fancy products that may not even work for your hair. I say keep it simple with basic moisture and oil. #Boom

4202 2018-07-11 17:37:22 McCain is a back stabbing traitor Anybody with half a brain knows that. Bush has shown his true colors to America and what matters most to him. The money and his oil. You should get a new hobby because defending garbage doesn't work well for you. I bet you've trashed talked both
4203 2018-07-11 17:37:18 while you're looking up, apply eye drops! 

And also castor oil, apparently, for long lashes.
4204 2018-07-11 17:37:09 Don't worry, we triple-checked with @Waterford ;)
4205 2018-07-11 17:37:09 Is clove oil still a thing ?
4206 2018-07-11 17:37:04 These people are brain dead. Trump slams Germany for giving billions to Russia for energy and they call that a win for Putin.

Putin could lose billions if Germany has to buy oil from somewhere else.
4207 2018-07-11 17:36:50 Svp
Castor oil ça marche vraiment pour les barbes? 
Peut-être si je fais pousser une barbe on va arrêter de me demander si j'ai moins de 15 ans
4208 2018-07-11 17:36:50 Oil Cos & Banks are absurdly huge that when a headline says, "Chevron fined $9.5B," I have no idea if that's a lot or a slap on the wrist, but it's usually the latter.
4209 2018-07-11 17:36:49 Herbs would probably burn. I'd just use olive oil and salt. When they turn brownish they'll be slightly sweet.
4210 2018-07-11 17:36:43 Germany is stupid!  They made a deal with Russia to supply them with 85% of their crude oil needs.  Did they not learn from Russian occupation of East Germany?  SMH
4211 2018-07-11 17:36:42 For what calling out Germany for using Russian oil.  Have y'all gone beserk?
4212 2018-07-11 17:36:37 for every 'success story' in aa
there are 8 or 9 failure stories.

stop being duped
by snake oil salesmen.

4216 2018-07-11 17:36:20 Lol shake and coconut oil
4217 2018-07-11 17:36:15 it was your burning coolant/oil/transmission fluid cologne...
4218 2018-07-11 17:36:11 You don’t need condensed Coconut oil to clear brain fog.

You don’t treat the leaf when it’s showing signs of disease.

Go to the root cause and stop taking short cuts!

Clogged vital organs (liver kidneys colon)

Otherwise rip a line  of cocaine it’s about the same price!
4219 2018-07-11 17:36:04 I don't trust the person I was with today I feel like I should sprinkle holy water and speak in tongues while anointing myself with oil problem is....ain't got all those things
4220 2018-07-11 17:36:03 I’m still mad an oil change for my car is like $100
4221 2018-07-11 17:36:03 Why is Germany who want's NATO protection from Russia, purchasing majority their Oil/Energy from their so-called enemy Russia?
Arranged Russian pipeline sweetheart deal?
**Meanwhile, shutting down their own energy sectors?
NATO expecting foolish U.S.Politicians to fund 70%.
4222 2018-07-11 17:35:54 Palm oil makes me happy 
4223 2018-07-11 17:35:47 So if Russia is such a danger then the European countries should embrace Trump's call for a more muscular NATO and Germany should thank Trump for the advise of not propping up Putin's only industry with a massive oil contract.
4224 2018-07-11 17:35:45 Hopefully Russia doesn't shut the oil valve off on you. We, USA are elected thru NATO to protect Germany from Russia if the day ever arrives so we spend $$ on military in case this day comes and Germany buys their oil from Russia. Sounds like nato  is becoming obsolete.
4225 2018-07-11 17:35:39 Exactly. Germany is so busy spending untold $billions to house and feed welfare migrants plus buying oil/gas from Russia, that they can't seem to pay their own defense bills.
4226 2018-07-11 17:35:39 This fresh oil change got baby ghost gettin up
4227 2018-07-11 17:35:36 How did trump feel about his former secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, and ExxonMobil partnering in one of the largest energy deals in history with the RUSSIAN state oil company, Rosneft? It sure didn’t prevent him from selecting Tillerson!
4228 2018-07-11 17:35:35 Dear Mr. Tusk a true ally buys our energy oil/gas from the US or other allies not from Vlad. You don't slap on tremendous barriers to us doing business with you, strong arm Italy, Poland, etc. EU is imploding tick tock, angela, Theresa gone within a yr, #walkaway #@chuckwoolery
4229 2018-07-11 17:35:34 थोड़े दिनों बाद indian oil और हिंदुस्तान पेट्रोलियम भी बन्द हो कर पेट्रोल सिर्फ रिलायंस पेट्रोल पंप पर बिका करेगा #BikGayiGormint
4230 2018-07-11 17:35:24 This illegitimate jackass of a PRESIDENT is berating GERMANY only because they buy oil and gas from RUSSIA  instead of the Country who gave us and  exported the 911 TERRORISTS to the UNITED STATES,   ie, SAUDI ARABIA,
4231 2018-07-11 17:35:14 And we need the people who WE put in power on OUR BEHALF to listen to us and ensure that our planet's best interests are being looked after - not the best interests of the,in particular oil, industry.

4234 2018-07-11 17:35:02 Yep I remember too, if gas was tied to oil price we’d be around a buck a litre. My point is the cheap gas came with a cost.
4235 2018-07-11 17:35:01 “You may write me down in history

Does my sassiness upset you?
Why are you beset with gloom?
’Cause I walk like I've got oil wells
Pumping in my living room.”
4236 2018-07-11 17:35:00 And guess where most of our oil goes to ... very little stays here ...
4237 2018-07-11 17:35:00 Yeah just keep pissing off the only country available to buy our oil and other things good job mr. prime minister
4238 2018-07-11 17:34:57 Anybody wanna buy me some more acrylic and oil paint?
4239 2018-07-11 17:34:55 My  friend told me that  if you  rub COOKING  oil on your  penis  for  2 weeks it will  grow  by 3inches so I  decided to  try  it, well it  did  the exact opposite, I  lost  3 inches, my friend said, what kinda oil were you using, I said CRISCO he said OH NO, that's  shortening
4240 2018-07-11 17:34:54 Have you tried to brush it? We used to have a cat visit & it got covered in oil, so my OH washed it. Never found the owners, some cats wander, ours doesn't as he is scared of people.
4241 2018-07-11 17:34:50 Venezuela's economy was entirely dependent on oil prices. The economic collapse there was due to a sudden crash in the market, not "socialism".

4246 2018-07-11 17:34:32 It's not going to change overnight. Of course we're still extremely reliant on the oil and gas industry. A diverse economy doesn't mean oil and gas won't be the majority either though, even when the changes they implemented bear fruit, it just means there will be more options
4247 2018-07-11 17:34:30 Political fixing and incompetence are job requirements.
4248 2018-07-11 17:34:30 What pops out to me .. Penn Oil , HTX  + old standard oil -> some pxl were replaced by a Houma LA O&G service co. in OH -> gaslandia
4249 2018-07-11 17:34:19 Nope. Rescission of Clean Water rules don’t give us cleaner water-perhaps you’d rather have Flint city water to drink? Right to try experimental Rx is fine in concept, but there should still be some regulatory oversight or else snake oil salesmen will be back before you know it.
4250 2018-07-11 17:34:11 Today Trump states there was a deal that makes Germany heavily dependent on Russian oil/energy (deal Merkel made w/Putin) while thru NATO the US is defending Germany without receiving any payments as outlined in NATO. All factual. 

Trump operates with total allgnce 2 USA
4251 2018-07-11 17:34:11 Yeah, I don't know what's rags your reading DJT has done no oil deals w Russia
4252 2018-07-11 17:34:02 Germany is getting its oil and gas from various sources, still has too many power plants using coal, but is also developing renewable energies rather successfully, which you would understand, Mr.Trump, if you took the time for some research rather than using it to tweet lies.
4253 2018-07-11 17:33:45 Baby oil?
4254 2018-07-11 17:33:40 That’s depressing
4255 2018-07-11 17:33:38 The combo I made with tea tree oil and witch hazel might be too lethal
4256 2018-07-11 17:33:35 I had the same question. 
4257 2018-07-11 17:33:30 @camanpour You are factually incorrect NATO, Trump, Russia! You are mouthpiece of the left! NATO members must up their defense contribution, Germany is under Russia's control 70% dependence on Russia's oil!  NATO suppose to protect them from Soviet Union? Pres Trump right!
4258 2018-07-11 17:33:27 By proposing to replace Germany's Russian oil pipeline with an American pipeline, President Trump spit in Putin's face.
4259 2018-07-11 17:33:24 綺麗事を聞くことは、共感を通して自分を正当化してるように勘違いできるので好きですが、綺麗事を押し付けられるのは、綺麗事の対に自分が置かれてるような気がして嫌いです。

4269 2018-07-11 17:32:49 @Scavino45 Dan why can't President Trump charge a tax on Europe on the energy they buy from Russia Oil and gas and the monies collected go straight to our military to support Europe
4270 2018-07-11 17:32:39 He criticized Germany for buying Russian oil and gas. He has also recently said Germany should buy gas and oil from us which does the opposite of helping the Russians.
4271 2018-07-11 17:32:34 Take a tincture of linseed oil so you don't come down with the grippe
4272 2018-07-11 17:32:31 I'll probably be rushing in late (still on a train), and be covered in bike oil. That's my usual look.
4273 2018-07-11 17:32:30 I think you will find that the oil belongs to the UKCS which is not all of Scotland. If independence was ever to be obtained by Scotland the oil fields would be split up as per the median arrangement. So no 98% is not Scotland’s at all and never will be.

4275 2018-07-11 17:32:11 So, Trump telling Europe not to depend on Putin for gas/oil is going to hurt Putin?
4276 2018-07-11 17:32:10 People nearly always say, `It just stopped one day.' Yes, it did, after decades of no cleaning, no oil, clouds of skin, hair & dust floating around your house working its way into the movt. This is the hard knock life for antique clocks y'see..
4277 2018-07-11 17:32:06 I bought a 2005 TrailBlazer and I got the windshield replaced, it is inspected as of today! Now all that’s left is tires and an oil change
4278 2018-07-11 17:32:06 My mom just found old vape juice of mine and asked what it was and I said essential oil and then she proceeded to put it all over her face...
4279 2018-07-11 17:32:03 Interesting documentary on the news last night about California and it’s oil pumps in the suburbs of communities there ...oil is dirtier than our Canadian tar sands and not one protester in sight!  People are getting ill from toxics from the oil pumping....no enviro rules there!
4280 2018-07-11 17:31:49 Yeah oil dissolves condoms I think, it damages the latex. So it's fine for sex if you're not using a condom. I can't speak for anal but I'm guessing it would be the same.
4281 2018-07-11 17:31:48 To make China # 1 economy & USA energy-dependent again—& pull off cheapest, most-profitable coup in history—

China & partners can produce & export US oil& NG

& pay immigration activists/coyotes/cartels to help ~70 M refugees & 750 M future refugees come to USA ASAP.
4282 2018-07-11 17:31:41 Here is another example of how the media has gaslighted you over the years irt to our economy. Think Saudi Arabia most people think it's a wealthy nation because of it's oil. But in reality it's GDP is only about 680 billion about the same size as Ohio's. We have 6 states bigger.
4283 2018-07-11 17:31:40 Churches friend Chicken livers they are ok if you like them. Yeah Churches don't cut back on the oil lol
4284 2018-07-11 17:31:37 He is Putin's puppet & therefore he tries to ruin their oil deal where they will earn millions?!? Try to make a tiny bit of sense please
4285 2018-07-11 17:31:34 I can’t say it enough that coconut oil will break you out, lemon juice will burn you, and lavender EO is irritating, not soothing.
4286 2018-07-11 17:31:22 Intelligent and women ...water and oil
4287 2018-07-11 17:31:19 USA is a energy Exporter! Time for NATO countries eg Germany to buy from USA oil and gas! Figure that one out!
4288 2018-07-11 17:31:12 There are lots of oil facilities in & around Hollywood as well. Cleverly disguised as apartment buildings, water towers, parkades, etc.
4289 2018-07-11 17:31:08 As a US taxpayer are you okay with paying for #Germany & #NATO’s military budget to protect from Russia, while they send $billions to their business partners Russia for all their oil?
4290 2018-07-11 17:31:06 Well said. As if they are paying from their own pockets. Apart from that Oil price hikes got @ 6L crores bonanza for the government for which Government doesn’t have proper reason or accounts, burdening common man on tax and talking big about their ......
4291 2018-07-11 17:31:04 A new era doesn’t mean we forget Russia is not our ally, resentful, fearful and expansionist.  It means we understand their vulnerabilities. Trump was right to point out German dependence on Russian oil because without oil and natural gas sales Russia wouldn’t have an economy
4292 2018-07-11 17:30:54 I think she is "nuts in the Fan" They will eat the black oil sunflower seeds in bird food. You may want to take feeders in at night or make sure they are empty.
4293 2018-07-11 17:30:47 So all that fighting is over oil and gas right?
4294 2018-07-11 17:30:39 Mines because it was time for an oil change and I need to reset the computer. I've had it scanned numerous times. As much as I drive it's not worth unhooking my battery every 3000 miles lol.
4295 2018-07-11 17:30:32 60% of our oil comes from Latin America and we know Trump hates Mexicans, Africa, well you can add your own comment there, The Persian Gulf, add comments again and Canada, which he’s trying to ass pump with Tariffs.  But now he’s worried about Germany = Trump losing money!
4296 2018-07-11 17:30:32 George Russell: Black Tickle is extremely heat insecure. There is no fuel supplier, and the community is tundra (no immediate access to firewood). Community is rationed for the amount of home heating oil they can consume.

4298 2018-07-11 17:30:30 Why don’t you post on what he said  at the meeting about Germany raking in billions from an oil deal with Russia, while at the same time asking American workers to pay more than they do for protection against places like Russia?  He has a very valid point.
4299 2018-07-11 17:30:28 hey hi get some argan oil for your hair!! it helps to minimize breakage and gets some hydration back in there. Deciem has some for $6.80 
4300 2018-07-11 17:30:25 Oh I agree, for Canada and the US, purchasing oil or other vital resources from each other is just as secure as sourcing them domestically.
4301 2018-07-11 17:30:20 It was mentioned on #VarneyCo @FoxBusiness that 

1) #EU is getting 75% of their oil from #Russia while blocking our goods coming in to them

2) #US is gearing up to be able to supply 80% of world’s oil
#Brexit #Millennials #Women #Blacks #Hispanics @realDonaldTrump #Trump
4302 2018-07-11 17:30:19 They pay billions of dollars because Russia has the gas and oil that Europe needs. It's called international trade. If they boycott Russian natural gas especially, their economies would die. You realize oil and gas aren't made in a factory, right? Not everyone has it.
4303 2018-07-11 17:30:17 Aidan their token support was diplomatic in jest to show support of a greater plan to infiltrate the Middle East & Control oil as per their interests. Bush was clear that they are with him or against him.
4304 2018-07-11 17:30:13 No oil bout 2 mins each side its peng

I was not amused.

4308 2018-07-11 17:29:41 I was able to cure 2 root canal with oil pulling + tea tree oil and a garlic cleanse. Synthetic medicine only gives you synthetic results. The fluoride dentist use is NOT the same “natural mineral” that was promoted all those years ago.
4309 2018-07-11 17:29:27 It is crazy for the Europeans to be so dependent on Russian oil & natural gas.  That is a legit concern.  If Russia turns off the spigots Europe is screwed NATO or no NATO.  God, you need to work on how you FRAME the message.
4310 2018-07-11 17:29:22 Life is too short to remain with someone that makes you unhappy over money!!

4313 2018-07-11 17:29:06 President Trump is RIGHT again>> We are spending Billions of dollars keeping a Military presence in Germany to protect them from the Russians, while Germany BUYS Billions of Dollars worth of Oil and Gas from Russia. How about BUYING America???
4314 2018-07-11 17:29:02 Once again using alternative facts and speaking like he actually has a handle on world events.  Germany receives 30% of their oil from Russia, not the 70% he stated.  Once again he is beating up our allies.  Once again he is an embarrassment.
4315 2018-07-11 17:28:58 If we had the port we would sell at full market price, this is not a sale of oil to Alaska , but simply a means or access to a deep water port for export, not a sale of oil to the USA
4316 2018-07-11 17:28:49 It's the power of the human face meeting light as in Northern European oil painting. The best DOPs and directors like Dreyer know all about what it means to paint with light- also Moss = the emotional mask of Gilead +the light of awareness moving very subtlely across her face.
4317 2018-07-11 17:28:48 2/3 Defnse spndg from US 3.5%
France/UK just over 2
Germany just over 1
Canada even less
EU wants US providing Military/Financial resources to protect from Russia, other threats yet Germany is Russia’s largest export market & 
Europe is Russia’s largest exprt mrkt in oil products
4318 2018-07-11 17:28:39 Ooh, I might have to try her concealer out. My skins so dry that anything with a 'matte' finish ends up getting very chalky, very quickly - even with a few drops of beauty oil mixed in.
4319 2018-07-11 17:28:36 And you can't vary the generation to match demand as France found out- Exporting excess generation at a loss, investing in oil, gas for balancing, and running fossil hot for unplanned outages.

4321 2018-07-11 17:28:31 They intentionally built the infrastructure and the US has oil for sale. Why not buy your products from your allies, not your enemy who your ally is sworn to protect you from.?
4322 2018-07-11 17:28:30 The tax benefits aren’t worth the potential downside. I am ride or die type loyalty and I will stand by whomever I love forever and I still see zero point to marriage. I would be happy to wear a ring so other men don’t harass me, but I would rather it be a continuous choice.
4323 2018-07-11 17:28:29 Germany gets 9% of its oil from Russia while you get 100% of their support.
4324 2018-07-11 17:28:24 How much are you paying Canada for gas, oil, and hydro? You're as much under our control as Germany is under Russia's. But you're a moron, so you'll never figure that out.
4325 2018-07-11 17:28:24 Just got my oil changed at @mikebarneynissn and they detailed detailed my vehicle!! So now no one is ever allowed in it ever again. #LikeNew
4326 2018-07-11 17:28:19 @Jaxx828  I’m also a big time Patriots fan  and sports fan of Boston  but when it comes to Trump he’s a disgrace even our governor a republican didn’t vote for him ! He’s destroying our environment and he’s bent on oil rigs in the Atlantic the ocean  I swim in  He’s no good !
4327 2018-07-11 17:28:14 Tamanu oil
4328 2018-07-11 17:28:14 Oil prices and rents are rising as GOP readies to Atn Rand the safety nets.And u don't believe we'e on the eve of destruction...
4329 2018-07-11 17:28:03 Hey Merkel, Europe: If you want to be dependent on Russian oil and send $billions to Russia for oil, fine.

Just don’t do so and then expect US taxpayers to continue paying for your military budget to protect yourself from your oil friends!

4330 2018-07-11 17:27:56 There are two things in this world that scare me.
1. Moths
2. The thought the waiting staff at Wagamama are going to move the chilli oil to another table
4331 2018-07-11 17:27:55 HEADLINES FROM THE FUTURE:
2020:  Germany to buy ALL gas and oil from Russia.
2025:  Russia raises prices beyond Germany's ability to pay.
2028:  Russia orders Germany to quit NATO.
2031:  Russia to station troops in Germany in exchange  
           for gas and oil.
4332 2018-07-11 17:27:47 Saddest thing I've heard today is that Nigeria, the 13th largest oil producer in the world, is having gas shortages because they dont refine their own oil.
4333 2018-07-11 17:27:45 Finally getting a damn oil change all I need is a car wash now 
4334 2018-07-11 17:27:43 @realDonaldTrump .Pres. Trump..., you have to realize that Europe is 'facing' 'famine' every day... A diet on wine, beer, oil and potatoes does not get too far... Fisheries are helpful, but not enough either... This situation creates health problems... and famines leads to WARS./
4335 2018-07-11 17:27:35 Pro environment and China - touch contradictory no? And Tim’s actually caved to a few anti oil sands customers...it wasn’t their own moral high ground that made them discontinue the ads it was pandering to the few.
4336 2018-07-11 17:27:30 Maybe because Russia provides a better service when it comes to not invading every damn country? 
If members won't pay, pull out the hardware and sell it for scrap. Then get massive wind and solar installed, like Germany has. No need for oil and gas & wars where we're going. Bye.
4337 2018-07-11 17:27:26 Zoom in on an old oil painting?
4338 2018-07-11 17:27:25 That's just not true. If you mean Saudi Arabia, it buys billions of dollars of weapons from the US and also regulates the oil market for them.
4339 2018-07-11 17:27:19 Det internasjonale markedet bør ikke stole på NoregNorge som leverandør av gass eller olje. Grønnvasker-eliten har allerede klart å hindre leting etter olje og gass i Lofoten.
Statoil fikk et senzurert navn uten ordet oil i navnet.
Russerne har ikke klima-angst.

4341 2018-07-11 17:27:15 Yeah, Nigeria has oil. Realized you meant Iraq. Those are not my people. If you're Christian, it doesn't make you a African just because there are African Christians. (Also, remember the iQuran tweet I referred to terrorists and Islamophobes as "bastards"? Consider the app.)
4342 2018-07-11 17:27:15 Weak on Russia?

Trump advocates taking away Russia’s main source of income which is their oil by calling out Germany for buying billions of Russian natural gas!!!

All this just ahead of Russian summit with Putin!!!
4343 2018-07-11 17:27:03 just shorted CLU2018, wti sept futs. my first ever oil bet.
4344 2018-07-11 17:27:02 RT ananavarro: Trump tells NATO, Germany is controlled by Russia because that’s from where Germany gets its oil.
Ok, well, by that logic....
Trump is controlled by Russia because that’s from where Trump got his presidency.
4345 2018-07-11 17:27:00 I’m going to try the bio oil
4346 2018-07-11 17:26:46 I realize but they would allow us access to a deep water port, whoever built it would own the line and oil flowing through , it would not be oil sold to. Alaska
4347 2018-07-11 17:26:46 That idiotic!
Germany wants us to protect them then turns around and buys oil/gas from RUSSIA 
THINK FOR A MINUTE , oil/gas are Russias ONLY export and Europe buys it.
OPEC and the us are about to step up production -lowering the price to hurt russia
And help us.
4348 2018-07-11 17:26:42 America buys allot of oil from Saudi Arabia sooooo what does that mean
4349 2018-07-11 17:26:29 Trump has outed NATO as the scam it is, which is to use US taxpayers to pay for their defense against “enemy” Russia, while Europe openly surrenders to Russia, who’s actually their friend & business partner to whom they pay $billions for oil. Of course Europe (&libs) are outraged
4350 2018-07-11 17:26:27 Glad someone saw some oil. From my perspective all I saw was the complete corporate and government takeover of one of the few places left in this country with some independance and self-determination.
4351 2018-07-11 17:26:24 No...Many of us are fed up with coal & oil companies owning our government! I’m sick & tired of good alternative energy companies being bought out & ignored in favor of continued use of pollutants. That’s coming from a multigenerational Appalachian, coal county, native!
4352 2018-07-11 17:26:21 We have free will, we choose to be dependent on Russian Gas rather than American Oil – you see we trust Vlad the Bad more than we trust Trump!
4353 2018-07-11 17:26:21 UN Secretary-General has stressed issues not included in JCPOA should be addressed outside the framework - Spokesman when asked about issues surrounding countries threatened by US sanctions for importing Iranian oil
4354 2018-07-11 17:26:16 Tryna see if i want stop and get this oil change since I’m right here 
4355 2018-07-11 17:26:14 sheer destructive force of the unprecedented sanctions, embargoes, & outside interference combined with the entire situation going on with their oil industry makes it much more difficult for them to follow a market blueprint such as that used by modern china, put simply ...
4356 2018-07-11 17:26:13 2 avocados, no pits. Uncooked olive oil, 1/2 key lime juice, turmeric, add pure sea salt depending on taste. Mash/slice, use skin as bowl
4357 2018-07-11 17:26:10 won't happen because of Big Oil's control of US politicians, oil making extra billions pays for a large part of the swamp.
4358 2018-07-11 17:26:08 Cool then let's buy oil from Iran at a much cheaper price and destroy russias economy once and for all.

#trumprussia
4359 2018-07-11 17:26:06 The day after the ref the £ lost 15% of its value. Whilst Rees-Mogg, Farage and their friends made millions the rest of us ended up paying more for everything we import - which includes 60% of our food, much of our oil and energy and much else besides.
4360 2018-07-11 17:26:03 The Rump attacks Angela Merkel for making the decision to pay less for gas/oil by purchasing from RU saving Germans money; while he puts jobs in jeopardy and increases cost of living for Americans through #TradeWars.

Keep it up #TantrumThrowingTrump. GOP will impeach/remove you.
4361 2018-07-11 17:25:54 Welllllll I found a big ol puddle of oil/fluid underneath my car this morning so it might be that and some sort of leak
4362 2018-07-11 17:25:50 Learn how to cook, they said. It'll help you in the future, they said... Oil freakin splattered all over my arms and it BURNS. THIS STINGS
4363 2018-07-11 17:25:50 If the USA has so much oil, and wants to sell to other countries, how come gas prices are so high in the USA???  I mean, MAGA with cheap gas!!!
4364 2018-07-11 17:25:32 Getting oil changed at lunch and guy sitting nearby keeps hacking. I hope it's allergies and also hope he STOPS STARING AT MY BELLY.
4365 2018-07-11 17:25:28 The U.S. buys 20% of its oil from Mexico and Venezuela.  Hence, the U.S. is #captive of Venezuela and Mexico.
4366 2018-07-11 17:25:25 PMSL. He tweets some crap and you assume he has fixed something??? Do us all a favour and drop out of NATO please. Then look at how much US pays Russia for energy and oil. Blind moronic followers!!
4367 2018-07-11 17:25:24 I tried that "doesn't kill baby penguins" line on my father-in-law in an attempt to get him to stop buying krill oil, and he just squinted and said "I have...I have too many other things I have to worry about, Terri." So I am related by law to an unrepentant penguin killer.
4368 2018-07-11 17:25:23 I KNEW THIS BEFOR BAROK THE TOP OF THE OIL WELL IS AT 5700 FEET BELOW SEA LEVEL. PROBBALY GOES DOWN ONLY 800,000 BARRELS OR MOOR.THE BOTTEM OF THE WELL COMES TO A POINT!
4369 2018-07-11 17:25:21 Trump told NATO, Germany is controlled by Russia because that’s where Germany gets its oil. Well guess where most of America's oil comes from... 

... Canada! 

So according to Trump logic, America is totally controlled by Canada. 

How soon can we come & uncage babies?
4370 2018-07-11 17:25:21 Here’s a question for everyone: why do we buy oil from Saudi Arabia and why aren’t they on the travel ban list when 15 of the 19 terrorists on 911 cane from Saudi Arabia?

4374 2018-07-11 17:24:56 The hair mask are very thick in consistency because it’s very hot outside! —it can melt, I didn’t want it to be watery—If you want to loosen the consistency simply add oil or water when you apply it.  -MGMT!!

4377 2018-07-11 17:24:38 Bagged for a couple years before a brief stint in dairy (no crying, but a lot of spilled milk), and then found my calling in aisle 4 - cereal, coffee, flour, sugar, oil.  They separated the box cutter pretenders from the savants in that aisle.
4378 2018-07-11 17:24:37 The zia and the lone star have a lot in common! Food!!!!! Western lifestyle!!!! Oil!!!! Hipsters (Santa Fe NM, Austin TX)!!!!!
4379 2018-07-11 17:24:29 I just priced out a custom 10' oil painting of Lord Palmerston, for no reason at all. none.  Completely unrelated, hey, @kesseljunkie your birthday is soon, right?
4380 2018-07-11 17:24:25 Regarding oil and gas dependancy on Russia, Germany will be carbon neutral in 10 years  @realDonaldTrump
4381 2018-07-11 17:24:19 The United States pays billions to Saudi Arabia for oil. What good is the war on terror if we are giving all this money to the nation that contributed almost all the 9/11 terrorists?
4382 2018-07-11 17:24:17 Never heard the Olive oil thing, I mainly used Aquaphor, Baby oil on the head if there was signs of cradle cap. After the first 6 weeks ( only sponge baths for that time) I maybe bathed them twice a week. Unless they had a major blow out or puke that required emergency bath! 
4383 2018-07-11 17:24:10 Bbbbuttt... who will pay for Germany’s oil then!
4384 2018-07-11 17:24:05 We have oil, YET we import it from the middle east!!!  What's the difference???  Explain that to me.....you can't!!!  Sound familiar??????
4385 2018-07-11 17:24:03 Yeah, unfortunately I had mouth full of food while I read this 
4386 2018-07-11 17:24:02 Sure did. Germany buys roughly 12% of their oil from Russia.
4387 2018-07-11 17:24:00 Well maybe we are sick of people like you who don't even know about the Rosneft oil deal conspiracy when Trump conspired with Putin.  Go read about the 19.5% sale that was completed Dec. 2016 as a quid pro quo with the Trump campaign (hence the reason Trump under investigation)..
4388 2018-07-11 17:23:57 Agree and hate subsidies.  IMO, best solution is to replace e10 with e15 effective 9/1/18.  Increase domestic corn demand corn by 2B bushels, cheaper gas for consumers, further decrease need for foreign oil, more acres to corn, eliminate need for grain subsidies in 2019 & forward
4389 2018-07-11 17:23:51 Now now, that was in 2014 when oil prices where high, looks like they are making a recovery now, & there is the added bonus of the new oil fields coming on line with more to come
4390 2018-07-11 17:23:51 It's a double edged sword.
4391 2018-07-11 17:23:35 Not really comparable though is it. If we were buying oil from SA while projecting an idea that they were a military threat to us at the same time and getting an ally to foot the bill for protection, then it would be comparable.
4392 2018-07-11 17:23:29 Donald Trump says Germany gets 70% of it's gas and oil from Russia. Actually it's about 35% for gas and 35% for oil. Has Trump just added up the two figures?! Hates Germany where his dad's from and 'loves' Scotland where his mum's from. Hmm
4393 2018-07-11 17:23:19 We can see that lol. Supposedly they have financial connections to the ruling elite. Moavenis dad Shahrokh was a director of #NARGAN, an oil company w lucrative deals with IRI. Vaez uncle was detained in USA on charges of breaching sanctions. He was importing luxury s to 
4394 2018-07-11 17:23:17 How I need a nail refill around the same time I need a whole oil change and gas!!??? This is literally nothing but the devil
4395 2018-07-11 17:23:12 ¿Te ha salido oil o ayer?
4396 2018-07-11 17:23:03 Told my unc how many oil changes we got left thinking it was gonna be like 5 , boi said 16 , i wish I didnt ask.
4397 2018-07-11 17:23:03 He is giving them a hard time about buying oil from Russia. Meanwhile they are converting to solar energy faster than anybody. He is just mad that they aren't buying oil from the US.
4398 2018-07-11 17:22:57 And we buy oil from Russia as well.  Additionally, we had a trade deficit of over 10 billion with Russia in 2017 and over 5 billion so far this year.  We are contributing to the Russian economy.
4399 2018-07-11 17:22:53 Getting an oil change on my car. 
4400 2018-07-11 17:22:50 Many states have ‘no fault’ - definitely would not like to be married in one of those!
4401 2018-07-11 17:22:41 Europe will keep buying oil from Russia because they have no other infrastructure/suppliers
4402 2018-07-11 17:22:40 Unfortunately the marula oil is too heavy for my already oily skin. My sebum production goes into overdrive when I apply the marula oil  but I’ll try it with a small amount!

4404 2018-07-11 17:22:30 Not oil, gas.

4409 2018-07-11 17:22:13 I think so. Anne Murray wrote Could I Have This Dance for the Urban Cowboy Soundtrack. Bud broke his arm in an oil refinery accident. Mickey Gilley is still Looking For Love in all the wrong places?
4410 2018-07-11 17:22:06 They have built the pipeline over 13 years and the oil comes directly from Russia.
4411 2018-07-11 17:22:03 Yes. Oil props up a lot of bad governments. That is why we need to move away from it as fast as possible. Increasing supply only makes it cheaper discouraging the transition away from it.
4412 2018-07-11 17:22:01 Meanwhile, medicinal cannabis oil, having been proven to alleviate severe forms of epilepsy, is still unlicensed for many suffering children. And the UK government, however apparently well intentioned, should move faster.
4413 2018-07-11 17:21:59 Sven is correct.  Aug crude oil contracts expire in 9 days so I will roll it to the next month contract in 7 days (next week).
4414 2018-07-11 17:21:56 Trumpsters will never recognize it's snake oil til the bank acct's overdrawn, the pantry's empty, the job & house are gone & H/C is OTC CVS
4415 2018-07-11 17:21:45 US imports 40% of its oil  from Canada: its single largest supplier. What good is USA if it pays billions of $ to Canada for gas and energy? And btw, NATO article 5 used only once: 9-11 when NATO called it an attack on us all and sent troops to fight and die along with US troops.
4416 2018-07-11 17:21:42 How can you attack Germany when the US is a slave to Middle East oil?!  You're a hypocrite & bully!! @NATO please do not believe that Trump speaks for all Americans. His election was a mistake we're trying to rectify!! Please have patience. #Impeach45
4417 2018-07-11 17:21:38 It's not the right time to think about renewable energy. You have oil you use oil, when you'll stabilize your situation you'll think about renewable energy.
4418 2018-07-11 17:21:30 Why do people even get married?! I hope to spend my life with someone I love eventually  but would be great to not be legally bound by the state to get screwed in case that person changes.
4419 2018-07-11 17:21:27 "therefore, exclusive reliance on oil may not be economically efficient."
Stupid stand.. it's the first time I hear relying on the energy profitable for others  isn't profitable to your own economy. What should Iraq do..? Buying energy it could produce..?
4420 2018-07-11 17:21:26 Established facts and Trump go together like oil and water.
4421 2018-07-11 17:21:23 On what planet does Putin control Trump? It's not on the planet earth. We don't need Russia's oil, gas or anything else.
4422 2018-07-11 17:21:20 Crude Oil prints fresh session low at 71.66. #forex #CRUDEOIL
4423 2018-07-11 17:21:16 Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone! Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius! Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen! Moloch whose name is the Mind!
4424 2018-07-11 17:21:07 It’s odd that one of the main countries who support the Paris Climate Accord (Germany) is in bed with a Russian Energy company that gives Germany gas and oil.  Where are the Climate Change Zealots?  Hypocrites.  #NATO
4425 2018-07-11 17:21:06 All NATO countries pay into it.  The 2% figure is a target.  Not a requirement.  Germany needs oil like every other country.  They are transitioning to green energy so they don't have to buy from Putin.
4426 2018-07-11 17:21:06 You have done nothing to sustain your accusations. Come on - who is it who pays me? What evidence have you that I'm a 'Tory'? How could I be paid by 'oil money or something a bit darker'? You need to prove these claims or withdraw them.
4427 2018-07-11 17:21:01 Ummmm... So how much oil does America import...?
4428 2018-07-11 17:20:50 hot fry oil on their finger tips, probably.
4429 2018-07-11 17:20:49 BTW, it’s not oil from Russia. It’s LNG -liquid natural gas.
4430 2018-07-11 17:20:45 Im assuming he’s talking ingestion but I don’t know many folks who cook with coconut oil any way, I hear it burns very rapidly.   It’s my personal moisturizer 
4431 2018-07-11 17:20:41 So we should buy American fracking gas and oil? Isn't putin your best friend?
4432 2018-07-11 17:20:37 Lot 19: Cab Jack low on Oil, Odometer Replaced.
4433 2018-07-11 17:20:34 You just admitted it's about 30-40% of gas (and only 20% of Germany's energy comes from gas anyway) and 30-40% of oil. You said this to back up a "total of 70%" claim, and had the audacity to tell me to do more homework!
4434 2018-07-11 17:20:26 Hopefully the Millennials will get rid of the Praise The Loot snake oil pastors on television.
4435 2018-07-11 17:20:21 He talks like a snake oil salesman.
4436 2018-07-11 17:20:12 When I checked back in 1995+again in 2005, it seemed we still had 50 years of oil in the ground.  Nice that we were able to buy the cheap stuff + protect our own reserves.
4437 2018-07-11 17:20:10 For every bit of 30+ yrs their NATO alliance has paid in less than their required 2% fee/share of cost. Trump’s maddeningly uncouth methods notwithstasnding, it is a fair question to ask why one buys oil from one we, the US, are charged in essence to protect them from?
4438 2018-07-11 17:20:04 it is going to take a generation to repair the damage he's doing to our standing in the world.

how the other leaders didn't jump up and go so please talk to us about all the oil you get from Saudi Arabia
4439 2018-07-11 17:20:04 It doesn't matter where Germany gets its oil when it comes to NATO?  I know the Big Orange Asshat is playing to his base but jeezum! The deal was done between two sovereign nations years ago!  The big deal is Germany gives a rat's ass about it environment.  The US doesn't!
4440 2018-07-11 17:20:02 Did you know that 80% of the errors were a direct result of lack of training, experience or qualification (competence) for the task being performed at the time of the incident.  Z662 section 3 and the API1173 now mandate code training and qualification & it’s working. #pipelines

4442 2018-07-11 17:19:55 Says the guy who begged OPEC for more oil recently. You’re a dumbass clown 
4443 2018-07-11 17:19:54 Russia is such a national security threat to Germany that they are propping up the only industry that Putin has by purchasing billions of dollars worth of oil.
4444 2018-07-11 17:19:39 Love this pic! Thank you for working to put smiles back on these faces! Reuniting children with their parents across this land!
4445 2018-07-11 17:19:35 lol at these cambridge ass liberals literally cringing in devastation because this brown paper bag cant be recycled bc it has oil on it
4446 2018-07-11 17:19:33 The Libya story is hot air... they have destroyed a big chunk of their installation and they are still fighting between factions. This message was ordered by OPEC to talk oil down... very curious to see real the coming physical loading in Libya!

4448 2018-07-11 17:19:24 Hence I always wear disposable gloves whenever I deal with oil paints.
4449 2018-07-11 17:19:23 Absolutely false! The rising price of oil is responsible and convenient since your donors all come from West TX Oil businesses.
4450 2018-07-11 17:19:21 Some of the best pasta dishes are the simplest, I love just garlic, olive oil, chilli & salt and pepper, your dish was perfect colours for the lovely sunny weather 
4451 2018-07-11 17:19:21 He's too stupid to know or Allies fought side by side with us in Afghanistan Iran Iraq now there fighting in the jungles of Africa. Didn't see you doing anything to help them get oil and Gas.get it where you can
4452 2018-07-11 17:19:19 Ethiopia has recently started crude oil production in the Ethio-Somali state, with the prospect of commercial quantities. SSudan, Kenya, Uganda - they all have oil. Reasonable to conclude all other neighbors also have oil. I hope we don’t fall victim of the oil curse.
4453 2018-07-11 17:19:19 Pake tea tree oil di muka. Angetnya sampe tenggorokan. 
4454 2018-07-11 17:19:13 Germany almost no oil/gas reserves so they need to import. They do have a heavy investment in green energy to eliminate carbon fuel sources by 2050. So this dependence on foreign energy will be eliminated. What Trump stated is a unnecessary criticism that only further divides.

4457 2018-07-11 17:19:00 Germany imports natl gas.
USA imports oil from Arabia and others

Germany is a world leader in developing alternative energy
Trumpy hates it
4458 2018-07-11 17:18:56 Hey Boineelo.. how did you apply? Tone first and apply the tissue oil or did you mix them together?
4459 2018-07-11 17:18:50 OIL OIL OIL . と紙に書くとサザエさんに聞こえる。
4460 2018-07-11 17:18:44 Ok! And trump can’t sell oil to Europe if nato exists?
4461 2018-07-11 17:18:44 It’s always about oil....
4462 2018-07-11 17:18:42 Laying out without sunscreen or oil, fuck me uppp 
4463 2018-07-11 17:18:42 Why do we continue to import oil from Russia and what about our trade deficits with them?  Or do you only criticize our friends and not your boss?
4464 2018-07-11 17:18:36 a) does he have any clue how the world's oil supply meets global demand? and b) one political goal of economic interdependence is to reduce the chance of armed conflict.
4465 2018-07-11 17:18:34 All India has to do, is to put a regulation to allow only certain kinds of oil to be mixed in edible oil preparations....
4466 2018-07-11 17:18:33 Well if you listened to the argument that President Trump makes absolute sense, We’re paying NATO to defend against Russia and then Germany A NATO Ally makes a great deal for Russia with Putin what if Putin cuts off the oil to Germany? Midwinter
4467 2018-07-11 17:18:28 I look glowy but I know it’s just oil
4468 2018-07-11 17:18:26 My man got my oil changed and got me a new tire since it had a nail in it 
4469 2018-07-11 17:18:15 Looks like Oil is crashing. I'm very curious how carbon will react tomorrow. My guess is that will selloff too.
4470 2018-07-11 17:18:12 What is the point of fighting terrorism if we give Saudi Arabia billions of dollars for oil? Do you not see the stupidity of your words? @CNN @MSNBC @FoxNews
4471 2018-07-11 17:18:10 You never opened your mouth when gas prices rose under Obama. If in your 30 useless, & divisive years Congress you had written a comprehensive energy program we would not see rising prices. We are in the same place 40+ years after the Arab Oil embargo. Thanks for your help.
4472 2018-07-11 17:18:02 I am working in Vancouver, BC #Canada
I heard an ad today about an oil pipeline that said "so we don't have to rely on the US."
I told my coworkers about the child stealing, the internment camps, the breastfeeding campaign we quit because of infant formula corporations. 1/

Just "discovered" a great new brewery in Newark DE. Midnight Oil.  Opened back in February so I am a little late to the party. But hey, better late than never. Had a few samples and then purchased a growler of XII.
4474 2018-07-11 17:17:55 where should they get their oil from?
4475 2018-07-11 17:17:54 Off day and I’m getting an oil change
4476 2018-07-11 17:17:53 Lemongrass and eucalyptus oil
4477 2018-07-11 17:17:50 What you said: "The US imports 60% of our oil, so by your standard are we captive to Canada and Saudi Arabia?"
My point being, we are not held hostage to any country regarding oil. You are lost in translation Jay, Germany is buying oil from Russia bolstering Russia's economy.
4478 2018-07-11 17:17:46 Almond oil nko?
4479 2018-07-11 17:17:39 This statement makes absolutely no sense! The brazen insults referred to = calling out Germany on oil/gas deals with Russia itself. So Pelosi/Schumer would rather us foot bill for NATO while a major NATO "ally" pays millions to Russia? How dumb do they think we are?
4480 2018-07-11 17:17:39 Not sure Why Oil would want him....
4481 2018-07-11 17:17:38 Dropped my car off for an oil change but they didn’t know I was coming so my cars still not done and it’s been 4 hours lol
4482 2018-07-11 17:17:34 News flash. Most country’s in Europe not just Germany buys gas from Russia. Just like the US buys oil from Venezuela (15 Million barrels of oil per month) and buys oil from a lot of other countries that hate America.
4483 2018-07-11 17:17:34 Trump is completely wrong! 1st-gas/oil Germany buys is only 20% & is NOT a NATO issue. 2nd-US spends $700-billon on defense. If all NATO spend 2-4% of GDP, US defense would still cost $700-billion. Trump lies, he is not trustworthy and he represents the American people poorly!
4484 2018-07-11 17:17:23 #Trumps asks a blunt question: why is Germany buying oil & gas from Russia, in fact 95% of Russian gas export, while NATO & US spend billions for EU protection against Russia. Is it because x-German Chancellor heads up Russian pipeline? US can deliver liquified gas to EU cheaper.
4485 2018-07-11 17:17:22 2. Walmart sells 97% lean ground beef that I use for tacos & there are many low carb wraps (usually has flax seeds and fiber) 

3. Good fats that I eat & low in saturated fats..like peanuts, fish, seeds.When cooking, it’s better to use olive & coconut oil opposed to vegetable oil
4486 2018-07-11 17:17:21 Mr.Oil Pen, 
Please address all further inquiries to my colleague @Lit718.  He will assist you further on this matter.

Best,
How old are you?
4487 2018-07-11 17:17:16 And how many will give their cars, tech, and homes powered by oil. A meaningless poll that proves nothing except 60% of 751 people are sheep.
4488 2018-07-11 17:17:14 Well Johanna l imagine there were more problems then his wand losing its magic. And Dr Oz please he is snake oil salesman as far as the aloe l drink the juice, and eat the gel from my plant and use it as a topical for abrasions.
4489 2018-07-11 17:17:12 But you know what? Soon we dont need any oil, gas, coal and so on while the US will suffer deaths bc of your EPA, gas, water and coal shit... clean energy is the future... and we build a lot of workforce there! Envious???... and we have minimum income too  and free healthcare.
4490 2018-07-11 17:17:03 Salmond told us we would be raking in £8bn a year from oil, where is it?

Salmond told us it would be worth $110 per barrel and that it would "remain constant" at that, how did that work out?
4491 2018-07-11 17:16:58 Cambridge Analytica were snake oil salesmen convincing those bedazzled by technology that they would help their campaign in return for lots of money. Obama and Clinton both used similar techniques. I wonder if there would have been the same outcry if Clinton had won

4495 2018-07-11 17:16:15 yes,

said US paying for EU protection but they buy oil & GAS fr russia

they must 2% of GDP immediately not by 2025.......

Hafta nikalo bhai ka
4496 2018-07-11 17:16:13 He dings Germany for their substantial reliance on Russian oil - and Schumer calls him Putin's puppet....Can someone please unravel this logic?
4497 2018-07-11 17:16:11 How much oil and gas do you purchase from Canada, Saudi Arabia? How about we turn the pipes off in November. See how MAGAettes like it when they can't heat their homes.
4498 2018-07-11 17:16:09 Well said
4499 2018-07-11 17:16:05 Indomie should do something about how i can never get all the contents out of the onion chicken oil satchets pleassssse!
4500 2018-07-11 17:16:00 Oh, the % going to NATO, you mean? His number weren't off on everything there. I thought you meant on Germany getting oil from Russia. 
However USA isn't contributing 4.5 or whatever he said. If you are going to make a case to what used to be allies, perhaps have your #'s right?
4501 2018-07-11 17:15:56 I was using coconut oil , I think it’s only supposed to help with the appearance which is a start & I seen something about coconut oil and aloe Vera together 
4502 2018-07-11 17:15:47 The United States is totally controlled by Canada. We supply 44% of your oil, billions of cubic meters of natural gas and millions of kilowatt hours of electricity every year. You are our captives! Canada controls you. Donald @realDonaldTrump has declared it to be so.
4503 2018-07-11 17:15:34 Really!? But not the ocean destroying, water polluting, land poisoning of oil, coal & nuclear waste? Humanity already knew these sources wouldnt last the growth of the human populace all this is is desperation defaming the future to maintain control & profits while the ppl suffer
4504 2018-07-11 17:15:31 Im sure Putin will be enraged Trump told the European countries its “irresponsible to give Russia that much control of youre oil” do you have any idea what’s actually going on
4505 2018-07-11 17:15:30 Get a pool girl. Problem solved.
4506 2018-07-11 17:15:21 Hey @POTUS! Germany buys oil from Russia. We buy oil from the Saudis. The terrorists in the planes on 9/11 and the exporters of sharia law and terrorist ideology. If you want to put America first deal with America's hypocrisy first. #NATOSummit #MAGA #hannity #WednesdayWisdom

4511 2018-07-11 17:15:12 You are just going to keep repeating this rainman? It is 9% of their oil purchases. It is a commitment they all aim to reach by 2024...not on YOUR timeline. And the only country they ever came to the aid of was US you fool after 9//11. So knock it off. We can't hear you~~~
4512 2018-07-11 17:15:09 Is crullers an omega 3 fish oil?
4513 2018-07-11 17:15:02 Yes anointing oil is very important, and all singles can wait after the service.
4514 2018-07-11 17:14:59 After a 15 minute wait a train arrives only to oil in and terminate early again in the siding. You are taking the piss
4515 2018-07-11 17:14:50 You know oil is about to top when stupid predictions like $150 start coming out!
4516 2018-07-11 17:14:50 and you @sfu? 

you've been quiet on divestment for a while now. last was that old chestnut 'we can do more to influence big oil by being a shareholder...' 

how's that going?
4517 2018-07-11 17:14:48 a guy at the oil change place where i took my car this morning recognized my hyper light drifter shirt and we had a nice lil conversation about it :3
4518 2018-07-11 17:14:46 "With the second largest oil reserve in the world, a revitalized Iraqi energy sector may be able to rely exclusively on oil-generated electricity. However, the oil-production system itself is highly energy-intensive; therefore, exclusive reliance on oil may not be economically
4519 2018-07-11 17:14:45 So even your own link backs up that Trump's figure of 70% is a lie. It only provides 30-40% of gas and oil each, which even together aren't Germany's sole sources of fuel anyway. Do your own homework, Kevin.
4520 2018-07-11 17:14:45 How come we guard Saudi Arabia for free. And pay them billions every year for oil they're not even a democracy
4521 2018-07-11 17:14:44 Buster Rod G ascended with Oil Man and laughed maniacally!
4522 2018-07-11 17:14:44 Would like to know how do you get the oil?
4523 2018-07-11 17:14:42 Snak
E
Oil

Makes sense now
4524 2018-07-11 17:14:41 Trump tells NATO countries to quit buying Russian oil.

MSM: “Trump is Putin’s Puppet”
4525 2018-07-11 17:14:38 Fight against China...
This fucking country is a huge disaster..do u know they wanna buy Iran oil by their money? Not USA dollars
4526 2018-07-11 17:14:29 Hmmm ... Germany buys oil from them, @HillaryClinton and @ClintonFdn “sells” them US uranium and @SenSchumer is worried about @POTUS #daylatedimeshort
4527 2018-07-11 17:14:27 Quit buying oil from US and you’re labeled to be in captivity?
4528 2018-07-11 17:14:25 you still in Julesy ? Hope all is good with you. xx
4529 2018-07-11 17:14:24 First they destroy Iraq to sell its oil on the black market, now with Syria in shambles, they are stealing Syrian oil?
Is this a gallery of the leaders of the Deep State?  Is Cheney cloned???
4530 2018-07-11 17:14:24 Me: yes, can I have an oil change?

Valvoline: your air filters could really use a replacement, it’s $34.99.

Me: it’s fine, I just want an oil ch-
 
Valvoline: premium air filters are a popular choice, okay your total comes to $76.58
4531 2018-07-11 17:14:20 Ok. For the record I don't support public shaming and protests. But don't kid yourself - Trump skillfully and maliciously unleashed Americans on Americans. And he is enjoying all of this greatly, periodically throwing oil on the fire to keep everyone nice and mad at all times.
4532 2018-07-11 17:14:13 So where on earth are European countries supposed to get there oil from? Switzerland? And since when does an oil company have anything to do with national defense? Does Exxon protect America with F15 jets? This talk may work with your gullibles, but not world leaders. #Trump
4533 2018-07-11 17:14:06 But he's trying to get Germany to stop buying your oil and gas now how is that a good deal for you?
4534 2018-07-11 17:14:05 I wish I had an essential oil that smelled like fresh laundry
4535 2018-07-11 17:14:03 Woow $oil #wti going all out in the selloff uh... trump can tweet all he wants about oil and the bitch to the Saudis all he wants, big drawdown in inventories+ countries can’t increase outputs and sanctions. Could see a bounce back by eow
4536 2018-07-11 17:13:57 Mercii mister coconut oil! 
4537 2018-07-11 17:13:56 Talk to EU about role of US sanctions of Nordstream IIl. Are there other Eastern block countries that could orovide oil?
4538 2018-07-11 17:13:54 Bio oil & coconut oil is what I’ve been told and Vera oil or something like that
4539 2018-07-11 17:13:53 #TDP #Oil #WTi -what a great week for our clients, sitting on a 74.- #WTI Aug short-
4540 2018-07-11 17:13:53 Gasoline and oil prices tanking on stock market and Albertans and tourists still being gouged by rich bxtch oil companies!
4541 2018-07-11 17:13:49 Germany also will eliminate all nuclear reactors going green while increasing indebtedness to Russian oil- oxymoron
4542 2018-07-11 17:13:41 Blm ngefek sih di aku, tapi aku msh pengen coba aja sampe bio oil nya abis. Syg udh beli mahal2 ga dihabisin:( akunya jg males sih balurin bio oilnya wkwk
4543 2018-07-11 17:13:25 Jamaican Black Castor Oil really works ...... so does #semenretention 
4544 2018-07-11 17:13:24 I totally agree Don jr. I love the fact that he has allowed us, the American people to actually see the dark underbelly of the way other countries are taking advantage of our protection, then turn around & purchase OIL FROM RUSSIA? Seems to me they dont need our protection!#MAGA
4545 2018-07-11 17:13:23 - blind or what? Germany is buying their oil from Russia, the very country the US are sworn in NATO agreement to protect from Russia. Anyone who doesn't get the point here is downright blind....or worse.
4546 2018-07-11 17:13:22 We're paying billions of dollars to Saudi Arabia for oil.  You are really an ignorant fucktard.
4547 2018-07-11 17:13:21 The stink of oil and carbon?

Perhaps this is a sweaty bloke fetish.
4548 2018-07-11 17:13:16 謎の野菜VSおれ
4549 2018-07-11 17:13:09 Trump - Sub Rosa comment! "Germany is captive to Russia." TRANSLATION: OUR COVERT ATTEMPTS AT A NATURAL GAS/OIL PIPELINE THROUGH SYRIA HAVE FAILED, BECAUSE PROXY WAR WITH OUR TERRORISTS FAILED TO OVERTHROW ASSAD. SO NOW.... DIRECT ACTION MAY BE COMING BY U.S!!!!
4550 2018-07-11 17:13:05 In 1973 German had an Oil Crisis.  I had a newborn baby.  NO OIL......NO FUEL......NO HEAT!  NADA None!  GERMANY YOU ARE FOOLISH TO COUNT ON RUSSIA.....THEY WILL CUT YOU OFF......JUST LIKE THE MIDDLE EAST DID IN 1973!
4551 2018-07-11 17:12:59 I used today as a mental health day. Bought myself an ice coffee to enjoy while I got an oil change, and Mexican food while I watch trashy tv (Bachelorette) for lunch.
4552 2018-07-11 17:12:55 Business oil boy
4553 2018-07-11 17:12:50 Where should Germany buy its oil and gas? Do you expect punitive damages of 2% of GDP will provide the incentive for this stop? Or will it serve to limit options further? #TradeWars don't work, neither does heavy-handed political posturing. #Economics #Russia #China #Trump #NATO
4554 2018-07-11 17:12:44 Germany has access to oil from UK, Denmark & other European countries, but instead chooses a pipeline w/Russia which makes them  dependent on the very enemy they want America to sanction. How ludicrous for this collusion to be allowed to go forward w/U.S subsidizing most NATO.
4555 2018-07-11 17:12:44 Just hit donation button and Gaunt will send you some freshly squeezed snake oil 
4556 2018-07-11 17:12:43 Trump goes to Europe and lies to Germany’s face about its dependence on Russian oil. Your pants are on fire, Germany replies.
4557 2018-07-11 17:12:38 You know we have to get energy from somewhere? Since you Americans fucked up the middle east, we have to search for other gas/oil suppliers. Also what about getting closer to Russia to built friendship and trust? If we divide the world in east and west, we risk more conflicts
4558 2018-07-11 17:12:38 Closed out a great trade in $gold

Options to the downside from the run up worked out great.

We are now setup with a long position with downside protection.

Only thing looking uncertain is our $usdcad hedge.

It should be going down but magically $oil has become uber weak.
4559 2018-07-11 17:12:35 Candidates getting angry at consultants for mentioning fundraising is like getting mad at your mechanic for insisting you need to change your oil every 3000 miles.
4560 2018-07-11 17:12:34 So what would be a fair charge to spend a day at a national park? Should we cut Medicare and Social Security to make up for lost revenue? Should we quit inspecting food or should users pay? Here is an idea. Let's quit subsidizing big oil and agriculture.
4561 2018-07-11 17:12:29 A problem caused by the US having wars and supplying weapons to these countries for over 50 years in the middle east over oil
4562 2018-07-11 17:12:28 He scolded Germany for buying gas/oil from Russia. How is that Putin's bidding?
4563 2018-07-11 17:12:27 Whisk egg yolk with a tablespoon of olive oil and leave on hair for a few minutes before your shampoo. It makes a great hair conditioner.
4564 2018-07-11 17:12:20 Do you see any chances of #oil hitting mid 60s in this leg?
4565 2018-07-11 17:12:14 China was ehh on ☭ Emi
Most people don't do this Central plan thing most modern it's a bit different also  isn't socialist they actually privatized the oil Raquel
4566 2018-07-11 17:12:14 He lied to you! Typed in 2%&asked them to pay 4%! We only pay 3.2% as the Richest Country on this Planet! An he mixed up Trade of the G7, to Security of NATO! An he lied when he said Germany get 70% of oil/gas from Russia!They get a lousy 20%, an he's screaming to open up Russia?
4567 2018-07-11 17:12:05 I'll take the $80/L that we had BEFORE the price of oil plummeted
4568 2018-07-11 17:12:02 Kalo aku si pake olive oil nya dari ovale kak. Dipake mau tidur bangun2 pink gitu bibirnya
4569 2018-07-11 17:11:59 Best way for Russia to take over Germany is to cut their oil supply. Germany is run by puppets. Cold war all over again if Germany stays submissive to Russia.
4570 2018-07-11 17:11:56 The buffoon used a number like 70% of Germany's oil comes from Russia. It is like 20% and they don't have much choice. The kicker here? Trump is a traitor with Russia yet is calling out other countries' motives and alliances. Pot?  Meet kettle.
4571 2018-07-11 17:11:55 Oil is not the same but the oil Nigeria produces is the same as one from Saudi Arabia hence Nigeria is a member of OPEC the group of oil producing nations so Sasol should have a deal with them instead so we can save money. Refineries can be changed later they’re not an excuse.
4572 2018-07-11 17:11:48 Also found selling oil and buying USD/CAD very profitable 
4573 2018-07-11 17:11:37 does this mean i can bring back rin swimmimg in french fry oil jokes @veccyboo cause i'm thinking about it now
4574 2018-07-11 17:11:35 Be happy that we pay your sponsor.
In the end it is us, that we consume russian gas/oil that made you president.
#RussianCollusion
4575 2018-07-11 17:11:34 You are the one who lied, saying there was virtually no money coming from oil, & Unionists always try to make the point that the oil is worthless, pretty sure WM will miss the money once we are Independent
4576 2018-07-11 17:11:30 natasha [cooking a fry up]: can someone pass me the oil i need to grease the pan

thor: say no more

[ten seconds later, thor returns with loki]

natasha: thor why is loki here

thor: you asked for grease
4577 2018-07-11 17:11:26 #cl_f st long in oil att
4578 2018-07-11 17:11:24 Excuse me, but America has always put its corporations first. Military intervention first. Regime change first. Oil first.
4579 2018-07-11 17:11:15 I wish NATO members would have held Trump's feet to the fire when he went off on Germany being a slave to Russian oil.
4580 2018-07-11 17:11:13 Aku dulu ke dokter diblg ntr ilang dengan sendirinya:") dikasih obat malah jd merah2:) aku coba pake bio oil sih ini.
4581 2018-07-11 17:11:12 Oh, and she'd get the kids.
4582 2018-07-11 17:11:12 I live with ME that causes neuropathic pain & I use Tramadol to ease my pain which has horrible long term side effects& addictive. CBD oil has been shown to be effective in easing neuropathic pain&not addictive. In effect a doctor can prescribe opioids but not cannabis. Stupid.
4583 2018-07-11 17:11:08 Trump people are legends! Everyday they push back the limits of dumb-as-fuckedness, they deserve their own little country to rule. Let's send them all to Alaska where they'd frolic in oil and see Russia from their houses.

4585 2018-07-11 17:11:04 Oh wow, at least there is some oil there
4586 2018-07-11 17:11:03 Germany is a wealthy country and not paying their share to nato. US is elected to protect Germany from Russia yet Germany pays Russia(Putin) billions for an oil (?) pipeline-> that's bizarre and I'm only 1  in millions who are happy the president has pointed this out.
4587 2018-07-11 17:11:02 I wash my hair everyday but it depends on my mother whether  I get to shampoo my hair or not I applied oil today morning only
4588 2018-07-11 17:11:01 yep CAD-JPY : potentially  same daily set up as seen  in USD-JPY  break out but oil move isn't helping
4589 2018-07-11 17:10:58 Is it? "Russia was by far the largest supplier in 2016, delivering 36 million tonnes, or almost 40 percent of oil imports."  Add that (less than) 20% of the natural gas share, you still do not get to 70% of 'energy'. 
Trump's figures are wrong as they almost always are.
4590 2018-07-11 17:10:55 Texas is no fault. She'd get half.
4591 2018-07-11 17:10:50 Possible..
4592 2018-07-11 17:10:45 عندي استفسار افضل oil حق التان ؟؟؟
 وين اقدر احصله 
4593 2018-07-11 17:10:45 It took less than 10 minutes for an oil change. Whyyyy do I always procrastinate it?! 
4594 2018-07-11 17:10:42 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
4595 2018-07-11 17:10:34 Whoooooooooooooo say what Russia & Oil no way!!
4596 2018-07-11 17:10:33 How do we/can we separate the "choice" from the institutional and systemic issues? And can this all be separated from the macro and micro terrorism of the army?

Macro = search for oil, poppy seeds, "terrorists", etc. 

Micro = citizen abuse, rape, murder, etc.
4597 2018-07-11 17:10:29 Rubbed baby oil all over myself and “laid out” on a beach chair in the summer so that I could be just like my big sister. #G5QS
4598 2018-07-11 17:10:19 I Got Out My Bed For Nothing Cause I Aint Even Need A Oil Change All I Needed Was For Them To Reset My Shit
4599 2018-07-11 17:10:16 He hates "gas"!??
TIP: SELL $NOG  Northern Oil and Gas, Inc.
4600 2018-07-11 17:10:11 Germany wants us to protect them from Putin, but they made a deal with Putin to get cheap gas and oil .  Protect you from the devil and then you make a deal with the devil...doesnt compute!
4601 2018-07-11 17:10:08 ん、これ油変えた？あーなるほど、ごま油をひまわり油で割ったのか。
4602 2018-07-11 17:10:05 Germany tried to get at Russia's gas and oil without paying them once, but it didn't work out so well.
4603 2018-07-11 17:10:03 you know Alex.. Just because Toady Trump says something doesn't make it true... Germany has FAR LESS LOVE FOR RUSSIA THAN tRUMP DOES. Trump  calls Russia & Putin great friends of America.  Not so for Germany.. moron. OH but the oil'n gas!!  well buy it from Russia or middle east
4604 2018-07-11 17:10:02 Saudi Oil Production Surges By Over 400,000 Barrels In June: OPEC
 
OPEC has responded to Trump's demands for more output. Will it be enough?
4605 2018-07-11 17:09:54 Hmm snake oil, now there’s a thought! 
4606 2018-07-11 17:09:51 EIA record one of the largest draw downs in inventory but Trumps threat of trade war turns the risk back on - slight retrace was expected as Oil needs to go again before mid term elections and it can't push off from $75 expect a stronger bull push in Q3 and Q4
4607 2018-07-11 17:09:47 Why shouldn't Germany buy oil from Russia. They are on the same continent unlike the US who would have to tanker it in. There is a total opposite view on environment here.
4608 2018-07-11 17:09:41 Nothing but servants and cowards on here. Its about time that a POTUS speaks the truth. We put sanctions on Russia and Germany gives them billions for gas and oil? We are not going to be the global piggy bank anymore. We should reduce our contributions!
4609 2018-07-11 17:09:40 1. So @GreenpeaceCA recently accused me - albeit indirectly - of colluding with "oil industry insiders" to bias a federal government report. Seems worthy of a thread...
4610 2018-07-11 17:09:34 No, Tomi. I 'mostly' supported GWB and GWH. Sure, they were oil cronies, but they had the interest of the U.S.
Dumpy does NOT. He's a destructive man child and Putin's puppet.
You MUST admit this if you want people to take you seriously.
4611 2018-07-11 17:09:33 Same  my mom forcefully applied oil 
4612 2018-07-11 17:09:31 We are not all sitting on vast reserves of oil
4613 2018-07-11 17:09:22 Why are you even still there? Stop talking. Stop selling them oil. #WalkAway
4614 2018-07-11 17:09:22 I don’t think Putin would want DT telling Germany to stop buying their oil and gas
4615 2018-07-11 17:09:06 United Oil kicked out a text this week warning of low moisture content resulting in no bonus and green berries.
4616 2018-07-11 17:08:56 I got lavender oil and it’s the best thing I could invest in 
4617 2018-07-11 17:08:39 @jimsciutto Hypocrisy: US was dependent on Middle East oil for decades.
LARGE FRACTION of US mil budget still goes to protecting ME oil & sea-lanes. ME countries (Saudi Arabia) are no better or worse than Russia vis-a-vis human rights.
UN-fair compare US planes w/ NATO Europe.

4620 2018-07-11 17:08:38 This guy is weak. Germany buys their oil because of pollution concerns from Russia and Russia will cause more pollution than Germany would have

4623 2018-07-11 17:08:20 Like Chelsea ain't oil aided!!
4624 2018-07-11 17:08:16 It fits the pattern of Trump accusing others of the things he is doing himself. He wants to profit or is already profiting from Russian oil.
4625 2018-07-11 17:08:13 Trump’s Sec. of State Tillerson had multi-billion dollar deal as Exxon CEO to mine oil...in Russia. Was stopped as part of sanctions. Obviously #LimpDickDonnie wants to be Putin’s exclusive fuck buddy.
4626 2018-07-11 17:08:06 Huhu wala akong make up remover pero wipes meron ako pero wala talaga. Kailangan ata yung mga oil based na remover.
4627 2018-07-11 17:08:00 WHAT NERVE!! Our idiot-in-chief went into NATO meeting like a bull in a china shop. EMBARRASSING! Yelling & criticizing Germany & their oil deal with Russia, WHILE RUSSIA GOT HIM ELECTED. Someone needs to teach him the History of NATO & the role we play.
4628 2018-07-11 17:08:00 A Storm Is Brewing For U.S. Oil Exports
 
Two geopolitical developments in recent weeks - U.S. sanctions on Iran and the escalating U.S.-Chinese trade war - are set to reshuffle the U.S. oil flows to the world’s fastest-growing oil market, Asia.

4630 2018-07-11 17:07:54 @maddow @hardball @AliVelshi @ChrisCuomo @greta So simple, the NATO thing. Follow the $$ as usual. If Europe doubles defense, where do they buy it from (USA, the largest arms manufacturer)? 2nd, beating up Germany for not buying Oil&Gas from us. It's always the money. Always.

4635 2018-07-11 17:07:37 Russia is the leading supplier of oil, gas and coal for Germany (30-40% for each energy source).  But go ahead, think what you want...  Just start doing some homework.
4636 2018-07-11 17:07:37 President Trump stands up against Russia at the NATO summit, Saying Germany shouldn't sign on a deal for a oil pipeline with Russia

4645 2018-07-11 17:06:51 How many people even knew Germany had a deal with Putin to purchase their oil?

Of course Trump had to say that in public, so everyone know the hypocrisy of the EU they claim Trump is colluding w/ Russia while Germany is giving Billions!!!
4646 2018-07-11 17:06:41 This guy lies w/o any thought!
FACT Germany is no more dependent of oil from Russia than is the
 U.S. from Saudi Arabia
4647 2018-07-11 17:06:39 That’s right, cuz Putin wants trump to tell Germany to not buy Russian oil and gas
4648 2018-07-11 17:06:33 Sure, try to blame Rachel for vacillations in the world oil market. Most Albertans know the truth.

4650 2018-07-11 17:06:32 #TrumpLies - #Germany @DFB_Team_EN  Imports 35% of their #NaturalGas from #Russia!  How much #OIL do we #Import! How much #Solar & #Wind have we deployed compared to #Germany? #FactsMatter @CNN @ABC @NPR @PBS @msnbc @AP #p2 @Telemundo @guardian @washingtonpost @NYTimes @LATimes
4651 2018-07-11 17:06:16 Trump is trying please daddy Putin on the world stage> See, Russia can’t be all that bad, Germany buys stuff from them.  

Trump: “It doesnt make sense that they pay biliions of dollars to Russia (for gas/oil) , and we have to defend them against Russia”
4652 2018-07-11 17:06:13 Kanti oil is not the same if that is the case than change the refineries so we can pay less and save money and lower our petrol price
4653 2018-07-11 17:06:13 The hell with Germany. They annex Crimea and then Germany builds a pipeline to Russia to buy their oil. That’s bullshit.
4654 2018-07-11 17:06:08 Absaultlly stop paying for Germanies Military when they went against the US. by taking in all the un-vented reffugies and immigrants.  Also paying billions to Russia for gas and oil so they want our money for the third time so they can be a socialist country run by Russia Insane.
4655 2018-07-11 17:06:08 my wrist is an oil spill????? mannnnnn FUCK this nigga
4656 2018-07-11 17:05:59 Germany needs only 25% of its entire energy consumption from Gas/oil. The rest comes from coal, renewable and nuclear energy. And for that 25%, Russia only counts for 1 in 23 nations that deliver!!! How can one speak of be captive? Ridiculous !!!!  Know your facts Mr. Trump!
4657 2018-07-11 17:05:53 WTI oil at $73.26/barreil, -$0.82.
4658 2018-07-11 17:05:51 If he’s afraid of pissing Vladdy off then, why did he call out Germany for buying Billions of dollars worth of oil and gas from Russia?

4660 2018-07-11 17:05:42 That doesn't make sense. What influence do oil producing countries have on the rest of the world for its oil supply?
You can have fundamental disagreements and still work together if you are mature...
4661 2018-07-11 17:05:29 That's right ..He asked them why we were paying to protect them from Russia while they were paying Russia for Oil and other goods,yet won't pay us the 2% we ask of them towards NATO..@NancyPelosi is a lying B itch. She is long over due for retirement.. Lets Make it happen Calif!
4662 2018-07-11 17:05:28 Bruh I’m getting my oil changed and I thought it’d be a dragggg sitting here for over an hour but yo kia has free snacks, free water, free WiFi, hella comfy chairs lol I’m living rn
4663 2018-07-11 17:05:21 tbh if you can change the oil you're already way ahead of a bunch of people and will get a lot of roi on just being able to afford that as often as the manufacturer recommends
4664 2018-07-11 17:05:15 Oil prices down down
4665 2018-07-11 17:05:14 My take - Trans Mountain is critical to Canada being able to diversify its oil and gas client base. The bargains need to end. Our oil has market value as long as we can get to market! Build the damn pipeline. @FairQuestions @lamphieryeg
4666 2018-07-11 17:05:13 dang my birchbox this month includes a purported hair growth oil are they trying to tell me something
4667 2018-07-11 17:05:07 That's a product of $100 oil.  OK wells have always produced large amt SaltWater.  Was never economical to produce, due to cost of disposal, which is injecting back into formations.  Ratio of SW to oil is 10 X 1.   But with lower cost drlg, SW disposal wells are cheap to drill
4668 2018-07-11 17:05:05 I bought this setting spray and at first it worked great, but today I used it and it came out literally as oil and RUINED my make up like literally smeared it off im so angry about it
4669 2018-07-11 17:05:02 All you dummies realize he laid out against Russia in his prebreakfast meeting? Why are the EU getting oil from them if they are the enemy?
4670 2018-07-11 17:05:02 The charts always win. Please be aware, anytime you "know" something, the big boys are always 10 steps ahead.  #Oil will head below $70 in coming weeks as per the real Pros: @GarethSoloway @ITMS

4678 2018-07-11 17:04:17 Coconut oil on my lips feels n tastes good
4679 2018-07-11 17:04:17 Is this why the US is in Syria? So that you can gain control and run a pipeline with Saudi oil to Europe?
4680 2018-07-11 17:04:10 Nooo, you need to double cleansing it,  first with oil, and 2nd with face wash,  then many steps after that /sigh. I know,  i shouldnt trust a man... Ckck

4682 2018-07-11 17:03:59 Everyone abroad now gets the impression that on the political level, the UK is a country of charlatans, shysters and snake oil merchants. We in Europe frankly are not used to this level of political amateurism.
4683 2018-07-11 17:03:58 At least it is pushing down crude prices. The rise in oil was worrying me

4685 2018-07-11 17:03:50 "The Terrible Trio": Why Goldman Thinks "Something's Gotta Give"
 
"The combination of higher rates, rising oil prices, and a stronger dollar has historically been a “terrible trio” for EMs."
4686 2018-07-11 17:03:49 I do too. There is no separation between the Russian government and oil industry. Germany and the rest of Europe should not become a willing hostage to Russia.
4687 2018-07-11 17:03:49 I work with more actual Africans, Haitians, and Jamaicans then i do with actual African Americans in the oil field  and i love it simply because it's less drama, they mind their business and work i respect that totally and they have an incredible work ethic....#BNTS

4690 2018-07-11 17:03:24 You mean like how we pay Iran for oil, you dumb fuck? Stop lying.
4691 2018-07-11 17:03:16 all we know abt nialls skincare is tea tree oil, masks and steaming and i absolutely do not sound creepy at all
4692 2018-07-11 17:03:13 Norway’s a different country with different oil reserves for fuck’s sake - you’re clearly not serious
4693 2018-07-11 17:03:13 BTW, Shell Oil hires anthropologists to help them figure out "how to strengthen the federal government while weakening tribal and clan power" I know because I was offered a job like that 20+ years ago by one of their agents.
4694 2018-07-11 17:02:50 Trump's point is valid.  It's no different than if the USA purchased 70% of its crude oil from Russia.  We would become beholden to them on such a scale that it may impact our ability to make sound diplomatic decisions.
4695 2018-07-11 17:02:49 Maybe that is not such a bad idea.  Maybe white Europeans should take over the oil rich middle eastern countries, and force the Muslims there to adapt to European culture!
4696 2018-07-11 17:02:33 Which NATO partner sells oil and natural gas? The US only recently started exporting again after a decades long ban.
4697 2018-07-11 17:02:16 And we buy the majority of our foreign produced oil from Canada, that place that you man Peter Navarro has said is governed by a person (that horrible Trudeau!) for whom there is a 'cold place in hell'. So what.
4698 2018-07-11 17:02:10 Where’s all this cannabis oil stuff suddenly come from?
4699 2018-07-11 17:01:55 @cbdoil I have chronic Lyme disease. When I take CBD OIL I get very nauseous even if I only take 1 drop. Can anyone help me?
4700 2018-07-11 17:01:51 Reason Trump is lying about Germany's oil dealings with Russia is now US big oil producer & he wants sale. Which is fine but say that - don't threaten Germany! Also,it's good Pfizer lowering prices but ridiculous the way this president threatens businesses to get what he wants.
4701 2018-07-11 17:01:47 We keep burning the midnight oil. May success light up our paths.
4702 2018-07-11 17:01:40 @YandR_CBS writers: Peanut oil doesn't affect those with a peanut allergy. All the allergens are removed in the process of making peanut oil. Do your research when writing your scripts, please. #YR
4703 2018-07-11 17:01:39 The same as the USA. When they get oil from Saudi Arabia. Maybe Germany should sell planes or bombs to Russia. Hypocrite!
4704 2018-07-11 17:01:30 Pity about the political prisoners, crackdown on independent media, and that president-for-life stuff, but oil...
4705 2018-07-11 17:01:28 NATO has kept the peace with Russia for over 70 years, without it the US would be spending much much more than it does right now... NATO is all that stops Russia taking the Middle East and its oil....  oil that the US TOTALLY DEPENDS ON remember!!!! Lose that & you are finished.
4706 2018-07-11 17:01:27 Are you under the impression that NATO exists to create markets for US oil and natural gas? If not, why on earth would the pipeline show that NATO is not good for anything?

I am baffled.
4707 2018-07-11 17:01:24 Remember when Trump said America's biggest mistake WRT invading Iraq was not taking its oil? 'Cuz I'm seeing a direct parallel between that statement and his Tweet.

4710 2018-07-11 17:01:16 See how Trump lie's? He tweets 2% here, an he told NATO he wants them to do 4%! He says Germany gets 70% from Russia Gas&oil, when they get only 20%! He taking a Wrecking Ball to NATO--Just like Putin Wanted him to! Then he'll go to Putin an Give away Everything: Like he did N.K!

4714 2018-07-11 17:01:01 #Trump 
dumbass wants rest of Europe to spend more on arms so USA can bomb & destroy more oil rich countries to loot their state Banks & museums.
Arms race using NATO against China & Russia as desired by USA
F**k Off buy your own Trident we can spend ours on civilization
4715 2018-07-11 17:01:00 Have you tried primrose evening pills ? You put the capsule in your vag, and it dissolves over night & helps soften your cervix, do not do castor oil, ever lmfao, have you tried bouncing on the edge of your bed in like sex moving positions?
4716 2018-07-11 17:00:57 Because I've used coconut oil before and it was amazing on my skin.
4717 2018-07-11 17:00:54 I mean he basically asked for an oil rig fic!  AND gave us a “western rom com” that he’d mentioned, in #BrokebackNatural. He is much, much better with all of it now that he understands it better, he’s practically a damn fan of it himself. 
4718 2018-07-11 17:00:54 whyyyyyy have i been up here for 2 hours to get a fucking oil change and new tires
4719 2018-07-11 17:00:51 Dangerous by telling Germany to stop buying Russian oil and gas? Sending billions to Russian energy companies? While we pay for their protection and they screw us on trade.  

Dangerous!
4720 2018-07-11 17:00:50 even after the US Crude Oil inventories posted the biggest weekly decline since 2016 of -12M 
Brent -3.6% 
WTI -2.56% 
Blame @realDonaldTrump  ?
4721 2018-07-11 17:00:50 Nice to see the price of oil going down, but it has about $20 more to go down.
4722 2018-07-11 17:00:49 Yes, but sadly he hasn't taken the whole "leave it in the ground" thing on board. CA oil is high on that list. Recalling his DOGGR coup early on, Jerry hasn't just been passive in supporting oil extraction. But how should concern about such a key shortcoming be expressed?
4723 2018-07-11 17:00:48 Sooo. How would you get the oil to Europe from US? It would cost waaaaay more money. But if we stay strong together Russia has no choice but to continue to benefit from the relationship NATO has with Europe. It would shut off anything if it feared retaliation from NATO. Get it?!!
4724 2018-07-11 17:00:46 Or by Saudi Arabia because that’s where the US gets oil
4725 2018-07-11 17:00:46 If there ever was a war with Russia, Germany’s dependency on gas and oil from Russia would STOP NATO in their tracks. WTF? Wake up to the Globalist BS
4726 2018-07-11 17:00:42 Also Lisa I agree with the hypocrisy that trump displayed today.  If Germany is paying billions to Russia for oil, they are buying the bullets that will be used against the. And they want America to protect them.
It’s a fair arguement.
4727 2018-07-11 17:00:42 .....and the annualised amounts? And how much did your economy pay to the Russians for the "small" amount of oil it took in the ladt twelve months? Trying to be objective?
4728 2018-07-11 17:00:38 Hi Jorge, we are disappointed to hear your oil change appointment was not completed this morning! Please send us a private message with more detail on what happened so we can look into this. Thanks!
4729 2018-07-11 17:00:37 Couldn’t agree more with this line from the latest @happensinadops podcast, “There is so a lot of bro-tech in #blockchain”. Most of it seems like snake oil.
4730 2018-07-11 17:00:29 Do you have evidence? Because I don't think this is more dangerous than shipping oil especially because much lower potential liability in case of leaks.

4733 2018-07-11 17:00:16 The policy geniuses that had no qualm with @BarackObama nixing Keystone pipeline with Canada nor sending billions to terrorist state Iran, take issue with Trump calling out Germany buying Russian oil. 

Sit down. 

#MAGA #tucker #dobbs
4734 2018-07-11 17:00:14 More loyal to Putin? How, by taking oil money out of his pipeline and putting it in ours? Loyal to Germany? By making them take on their own defense for the first time since 1945. That’s how long we have been paying. Decade after decade! POTUS has one loyalty! USA!

4735 2018-07-11 17:00:12 Not building Trans-Mountain will simply divert oil from a pipeline to railcars (like it is being trasported right now). #cdnpoli #bcpoli #ableg
4736 2018-07-11 17:00:03 May I remind u Luk oil that sells gas in the east of US.  Was a way Exxon could make further inroads in Russian oil.
4737 2018-07-11 16:59:54 That’s you’re response.  That trump will give the money to his buddies? Is this real? He literally said this morning European counties shouldn’t buy oil or gas from Russia putin makes a ton of money on that.  At what point do you sit back and actually look at what’s going on and

4741 2018-07-11 16:59:15 Maybe we should just buy it from the Iranians then? Or freeze to death in winter without Russian gas and oil, which we received even during the cold war? And who needs that much military during times of peace? The money is better spend otherwise.
4742 2018-07-11 16:59:11 NATO has nothing to do with an individual country’s energy plans.  Should we allow France to tell US where to buy our oil from?

4745 2018-07-11 16:58:57 Germany gets 31% of Russian oil, USA gets 40% of Canadian oil, guess Canada holds America captive,  right?
4746 2018-07-11 16:58:54 @NATO @jmeacham @potus
Nato:
Trump does not represent our better angels or what Americans need or want. He is a snake oil salesman that the republican party of the US and Russia elected to make it 1929 politically and 1968 socially again.  Send him to Russia and leave him there.
4747 2018-07-11 16:58:49 Germany is Russia's strongest European ally.  They are an little more than agent for Russian encroachment into the entire European economy... especially in terms of energy and oil.
4748 2018-07-11 16:58:47 Today I discovered that coconut oil can go moldy

4757 2018-07-11 16:57:44 Points well taken, but Europeans want us to pay for everything. They charge us enormous tariffs on our products, the want us to pay for NATO, They buy oil from Russia, they build underground sites in Iran....etc...talk  about a swamp!
4758 2018-07-11 16:57:44 Nord Stream 2 is natural gas pipeline not an “oil pipeline”!   Get your basic facts straight CBS!
4759 2018-07-11 16:57:44 With a history of corruption, hyperinflation and oil production collapse Maduro is giving away Venezuelan resources under conditions that the Venezuelan people, already suffering malnutrition, will not receive the benefits of this venture.
4760 2018-07-11 16:57:38 You're correct on alot of this, unfortunately. At the same time, let's not ignore Europe's warmongering history either.

Again, times change. We no longer have a globalist president interested in starting wars for corporate interests, oil etc.
4761 2018-07-11 16:57:36 I love robotic oil poffins~!
4762 2018-07-11 16:57:35 7% of Russian oil, NOT 90% like the liar claims!

How much Russian coal and steel are WE buying??

Lies, lies lies!!

4764 2018-07-11 16:57:20 Ukraine was trying to remove itself from Russia’s strong hold on oil and gas.   They had reduced (by almost half) of their Russian dependency.  Russia went in and forcefully took it back.  UN, NATO all against what Russia did.  Indeed #factsmatter.

4768 2018-07-11 16:56:55 He said it is inappropriate for Germany to make this side deal and buy oil from Russia. What did you hear? In the real world in which most of us live that doesn’t sound like Trump is more loyal to Putin
4769 2018-07-11 16:56:52 Two of the kits that are recommended to start on your oil venture,  large bottle or small bottle
4770 2018-07-11 16:56:46 Is Trump saying the USA is captive to Canada because they have oil pipelines to us?
4771 2018-07-11 16:56:39 This is great news! Nuclear is a money pit, with unsolved and horrific ecological and economic costs re the toxic waste generated, which lasts for tens of thousands of years. Take all that money and put it into true  renewables! Do it now! Although big oil stands in the way.

4775 2018-07-11 16:56:16 よく寝たと思ったらこの時間だよ！！起きよう
4776 2018-07-11 16:56:16 It’s 2018 n ppl still don’t know how to or have never put air in their tires or...... they don’t know how to checc & fill their oil.  i need a different planet to live on my nigga I’ve lost all hope in y’all.
4777 2018-07-11 16:56:15 #oott Why do oil bulls think it will always go higher. It rose from $55 simply due to iran issue.
4778 2018-07-11 16:56:14 @MSNBC so Trump is tough on Merkel for buying oil and gas from Russia our sworn enemy. So cutt my that collusion will actually hurt Russia by cutting Putin’s profits......
4779 2018-07-11 16:56:13 Exactly. If he timed it for the dead of winter, he could shut off the pipeline of oil and natural gas and freeze them all to death, while they fight with their broomsticks. Ridiculous.
4780 2018-07-11 16:56:10 Clue: Recession

Col. Mustard = tariffs
Mrs. Peacock = deficits
Prof. Plum = inflation
Mr. Green = global growth/corp debt/consumer spending
Mrs. White = gas prices/oil shock
Ms. Scarlet = emerging market financial crisis
Wadsworth = Central Bank(s) missteps

All, one or some
4781 2018-07-11 16:56:07 Because the plastic lobby is the oil lobby.
4782 2018-07-11 16:56:06 Something to do when there are no birds. But some would also work it out in tyre tread wear, oil and coolant etc etc haha
4783 2018-07-11 16:56:05 Canadian oil stocks, which missed the rally between $30 and $74, are now sinking because we went down from $74 to $72. Hilarious. #OOTT
4784 2018-07-11 16:56:03 Where's Communique today? VEGAS, baby! Adam & Lori are promoting high oleic soy oil to #schoolchefs at the @SchoolLunch national conference. Oil samples are flying out of the booth at this huge show that attracts nearly 7,000 #SchoolNutrition professionals! #ANC18 #USSoy
4785 2018-07-11 16:55:56 Would you think the World will allow Iranians to close Hormuz Strait.. Differently the answer is NO. You already mentioned 30%  of the world's oil exports is crossing by Hormuz Strait.. You made it clear "This is nothing more than a bubble"  #OPEC #IEA #EIA #OOTT #Aramco #Saudi

4791 2018-07-11 16:55:40 Why do you Americans buy goods from China and the rest of the world? Oil from middle East too...
4792 2018-07-11 16:55:39 You have no concept of how NATO works. 20% of Germany’s oil comes from Russia. That’s it. And yes, the countries should all be at 2%, but NATO, as a group, imposed a deadline to bring their contributions up to the 2%, NATO must be the ones to change it, not you alone.
4793 2018-07-11 16:55:35 I've got Boots Sun Swim & Gym conditioner and Argan Oil. I will report back next week.
4794 2018-07-11 16:55:29 yeah your statistics about how much oil Germany gets from Russia is wrong but then again not much you say is ever correct
4795 2018-07-11 16:55:28 A1) Oil
#GrundfosIndia
4796 2018-07-11 16:55:22 What good is America if we buy billions of dollars of oil from OPEC, when most of the 9/11 terrorists were from Saudi Arabia?

Seriously, what the fuck are you talking about? Is Putin’s puppet trying to deflect? #RussiaGate #MuellerTime
4797 2018-07-11 16:55:18 Can I change your oil ma'am
4798 2018-07-11 16:55:17 Thanks Monro Muffler Brake but I think its super cool to never do oil changes
4799 2018-07-11 16:55:15 Palm oil is what you've got?
Ma'am, you're fighting a losing battle here. I don't want to clog up the TL's of others. You are woefully under informed about the issue. Have a good day
4800 2018-07-11 16:54:59 They’re all either ignorant or in big oil’s pocket already.  #NIMBY
4801 2018-07-11 16:54:58 So there is uranium in DRC....and its the same that was used to build the atomic bombs that were dropped in Japan and soon there would be oil as well from Congo, l feel pity for the Congolese pple
4802 2018-07-11 16:54:47 Our Cuckoo for Coconut Oil is a great way to retain the moisture in your skin and hair when applied to the ends! Additionally, this oil based product can melt in this crazy heat too so by putting it in the fridge you can bring it back to its normal consistency for application!
4803 2018-07-11 16:54:45 It’s about time—especially if Germany continues to make side oil deals w-Putin!
4804 2018-07-11 16:54:44 @realDonaldTrump how do you have the never to tell #Germany where to buy their oil.  face facts you personally benefit from #Russian money.
4805 2018-07-11 16:54:39 It's okay to make them pay their 2%, and you can make a deal with Germany to sell them oil or gas. If you don't want Russia selling gas to them!
4806 2018-07-11 16:54:39 Quiet and Trump is like oil and water.

I guess Dan and Nate didn't get the memo.  The electoral college appointed a narcissist to be the leader of the free world.
4807 2018-07-11 16:54:35 Don't know, but I thought this was always considered a breach of contract. You are not supposed to benefit by doing the other party wrong.
4808 2018-07-11 16:54:30 

And Trump said that Germany gets their oil from Russia as his excuse. 

Also...and? You just showed that we are energy reliant on both Canada and Mexico. Good job?
4809 2018-07-11 16:54:25 Your already Caught in your lie that Germany getting 70% of their Gas/Oil from Russia! Were smart enough to look up the facts. They get 20% from Russia! Germany can buy any where at any time!Your the one control by Russia!Putin wants the end to NATO, an u brought a wrecking ball!
4810 2018-07-11 16:54:25 Absolutely true. Germany gets a majority of its oil from Russia yet our liberal #FakeNewsMedia is whining about a fake Russia Collusion story. And we have to protect Germany. #NordStream
4811 2018-07-11 16:54:25 What good is USA if they are paying Saudi, Iran, Iraq, Libia etc billions of dollars for Oil and energy? Why are europeans risking lives in these countries for an old war caused by the USA? The USA is using maffia techniques to threaten Europe, very bad partner, sad...
4812 2018-07-11 16:54:23 It's "there" not "their"

More importantly, from where Germany imports oil is irrelevant to NATO. The 2% for SELF-DEFENSE is not a commitment - it is expressed as a goal. It has not cost the US a dime.

Unable to even comprehend what our president must do you want to renegotiate
4813 2018-07-11 16:54:09 all this service team harassment news going around and i still managed to go get an oil change 

take that anxiety
4814 2018-07-11 16:54:06 It is horrifying  change but we should accept this it's going to happen and in coming days it became more faster. Another horrifying news is that countries like America , China want to exploit Arctic region by extracting oil, make polar silk route ...
4815 2018-07-11 16:53:53 For a whole pound of pasta use 1/2 cup regular olive oil, 4 cloves minced or sliced garlic, 1 tsp dried or 1 tbsp fresh parsley. Let it come to a simmer. Add salt and pepper. That's your Italian sauce base. Then add two cans chopped clams. Simmer until blended and mix with pasta.
4816 2018-07-11 16:53:52 Celebraties and picking names for their children has never mixed. Water and oil.
4817 2018-07-11 16:53:39 And when Russia has them fully dependent on their oil/energy they will cut the supply and demand anything they want and Germany will then come running to NATO/US for help.
4818 2018-07-11 16:53:36 As a Canadian who isn't impressed with my government's current stance on climate change, I also wish big oil money wouldn't dictate the care of our environment! The only planet that can currently sustain us. I can imagine how frustrating it must be to have the "leader" you have!

4822 2018-07-11 16:53:25 The President is Right, as usual. 
Why are we paying Billions of dollars to protect Germany from Russia, while Germany is paying Russia Billions of dollars for oil.
Makes
 ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE.
I smell a Rat, a Globalist Rat!
4823 2018-07-11 16:53:22 With this sticky situation, oil and gas deals & financial obligations and contracts were not properly renegotiated   and others overlooked. Bashing German energy policy adds to old problems needing complex answer. Fascism is not the answer. Remove Trump!
4824 2018-07-11 16:53:22 Uniquely identify your assets with an #RFID tag to reduce loss in the oil and gas industry.
4825 2018-07-11 16:53:22 I was a hydraulic mechanic in the Air Force deployed to Saudi Arabia. Got tasked by a high ranking supervisor to dispose of cases of unopened cans of hydraulic oil because the OUTSIDE of the cans were a little rusty. Had to explain the purpose of oil to him.
4826 2018-07-11 16:53:09 Trump wants our allies to properly fund NATO against who again? Oh yeah, Russia.

Trump is criticizing our "allies" for enriching RUSSIA with a massive oil and gas deal that makes them more dependent on RUSSIA.

Just how slow are you? Does someone else tie your shoes?
4827 2018-07-11 16:53:08 I think his attorneys didn’t help win support of fans. Seemed like he was trying to sell us all some snake oil.
4828 2018-07-11 16:53:04 STOP selling oil to them, STOP defending them, STOP talking to them, STOP trusting people who let MILLIONS of Jews die! They do nothing but LIE! #AmericaFirst #KickThemToTheCurb

4832 2018-07-11 16:52:38 Depends on the state, doesn't it?
4833 2018-07-11 16:52:33 Germany gets 9% of their oil from Russia, that hardly justifies your statement. #gaslighterinchief #pathologicalliar #putinspuppet
4834 2018-07-11 16:52:22 Should I tell my friend that she is stinking up our entire work department, to the point where my boss had to bring candles and essential oil diffusers to help the smell. She leaves in 2 weeks.
4835 2018-07-11 16:52:17 Stupid you!USA is PAYING to protect Germany from Russia, when Russia ‘owns’  70% of their oil production. They are fine having Russia supply them but ask other countries to DEFEND them against this country they are in bed with!! Trump doesn’t want Russia having this power!!

4839 2018-07-11 16:52:00 How is calling out Germany for paying for Russian oil supporting Russia? You guys are so freaking delusional.
4840 2018-07-11 16:51:54 Do you have something simple that you follow to keep your fingers on the pulse of global oil demand @crowdturtle ?
4841 2018-07-11 16:51:50 Trump just tore into them for failing to meet their NATO obligations that defend them from RUSSIA.

Trump criticized them for signing an oil & gas deal that enriches RUSSIA.

Chuck, just how stupid are you?
4842 2018-07-11 16:51:44 @Bob4Right

Just like the USA buys oil from Saudi Arabia when it was their citizens who bombed the twin towers - oh wait - there’s a muslim ban - Saudi Arabia included?  NO

4847 2018-07-11 16:51:19 Germany doesn’t want US base or protection. Why should they pay 30% higher prices for US oil while getting cheaper form Russia?
4848 2018-07-11 16:51:13 World got civilized and this benefited the Arab world or else All their oil wealth would have been looted by others like the way they had looted/destroyed the world when they were strong.
4849 2018-07-11 16:51:06 Will you’re not the pool boy are you?
4850 2018-07-11 16:51:01 Trump says Germany gets 60% of oil from Russia (closer to 35%), even so- how is the world okay with this relationship while we contribute 4% to NATO?
4851 2018-07-11 16:50:57 I can cook things drenched in oil and salt, does that count?
4852 2018-07-11 16:50:57 Hey.. 

Funny thing is Roman money is from Oil&Gas sector! The irony? 
4853 2018-07-11 16:50:49 Dumb
4854 2018-07-11 16:50:42 Palm oil is the main ingredient in the low sodium vegan vegetable bullion cubes I use mostly for making vichyssoise and gumbo. One day I decided to have a cup of plain broth so I dissolved a cube in 12 oz of boiling water in a large clear glass cup. Grease stuck to the glass bad!
4855 2018-07-11 16:50:41 This is no shock to me. This has been the goal from the start. Putin pulls all the stops to get Trump elected and in Return he would get his oil flowing and his bak accounts back. The GOP probably have money in Rosneft
4856 2018-07-11 16:50:34 That can also double as salad dressing. Add a lil oil and boom.
4857 2018-07-11 16:50:12 Didn’t .@realDonaldTrump call out NATO countries (i.e Germany) who have not been paying their fair share in membership dues?

Isn’t Germany working with Putin to secure oil and gas from Russia?

Trump called them out!

a) How is that helping Russia?
b) Why are you lying?
4858 2018-07-11 16:50:05 Oh word? My mother and father were both soldiers. Had girls I bet they disnt think well shit they are girls no. I learned how to change a tire, oil, engine, ball, fire a weapon, ruck, use tools, hike, assemble a rifle blind folded all before I was 13. My sister girlie girl.
4859 2018-07-11 16:50:04 Getting an oil change while I clock in
4860 2018-07-11 16:50:00 You forgot gas prices are up under Obama we were exporting oil now not so much, maybe it's because he's working at a Russian deal for their oil
4861 2018-07-11 16:49:59 Germany under Russia because of pipeline...than who are we suckling but big oil and coal.?
4862 2018-07-11 16:49:54 Doesn't the US give money to Venezuela? Why not stop purchasing their oil to force that authoritarian government to surrender and free the venezuelan people?
4863 2018-07-11 16:49:54 Nah the niggas at jewelry and oil kiosks
4864 2018-07-11 16:49:53 Isn't Trump the same guy that wants Russia back in the G8 and now he's giving shit to Germany for buying their oil and gas???
4865 2018-07-11 16:49:51 Kl kamu punya face oil pakein coba. Bio oil bisa juga atau minyak zaitun. Kalo gaada coba baby oil. Sama pake pelembab yg moist bgttt.
4866 2018-07-11 16:49:50 plenty of cities in tx had plastic bag bans that were super effective, but then recently, the tx sc ruled the ban as “a violation of state law” which is code for: fuck you, stan big oil! /:
4867 2018-07-11 16:49:48 From "easy to win" trade wars to the system of setting oil prices, Trump is on a mission to rip up the world order and remake it in what he sees as America’s interest. NATO is next on is agenda.

4871 2018-07-11 16:49:26 big issue here Toady Trump conveniently ignores ,he states Russia is a great threat to NATO European countries.while at home declares Russia a friend & ally. Additionally oil & gas are only available in most of Europe from either Russia or the middle east. Dotard's enemy Muslims.

4873 2018-07-11 16:49:25 Do just a tad more research sweetie
  - Canada and Mexico are our major source of IMPORTED oil

"In 2017, US net imports (imports minus exports) of petroleum from foreign countries were equal to about 19% of US petroleum consumption" - US Energy Information Administration
4874 2018-07-11 16:49:17 Try reality.  It's sometimes painful, often worrying, but ultimately much more satisfying.

Sin your roster, perfect world, where does mainland Europe get its natural gas?  Or should they use coal? Or ship more oil in tankers?

Oil/gas/coal/nuclear have all been proven globally 2 devastate the world wats more important? $$ or the world?
4878 2018-07-11 16:49:10 The world should unite, close all American bases worldwide, refuse them access the ports, airports, bases etc. Russia would then be free to take control of the Middle East & choke off oil supply... the US would collapse in less than 12 mths and then yes, we would have a world war
4879 2018-07-11 16:49:10 I'm never surprised at Dumbass Donnie anymore. When he was bitching about Germany getting gas and oil from Russia, he should have been told 'I've heard you say many times wouldn't it be great if we were friends with Russia? So what's the big deal?'

4882 2018-07-11 16:48:59 It's a double-secret reverse psychological ploy! Everybody knows that Trump saying something means all leftist world leaders will revolt, therefore Trump is causing European leaders to send billions in oil and gas purchases to Russia !!
4883 2018-07-11 16:48:51 Dear Eastern Europe:  Play stupid games. Win stupid prizes. The thing is, Europe is a lucrative market but Americans gas can’t compete there because the liquification process is expensive. But the gas lobby is powerful, and NATO is a tool of big oil.
4884 2018-07-11 16:48:50 And don't forget Russian oil. What a piece of work.

Leave for as long as you can bear it. The idea is to allow restorative oil etc to soak deeply in.Rinse, lightly condition if needed 4 tangles
4891 2018-07-11 16:47:42 All oil trades are conducted in US $.

Central banks hold US $ as the principal reserve currency.

These are things that are critically important to an economy with a fiat currency.

These are also things that are difficult to understand.

Dependence by any NATO member on Russia undermines the solidarity of the Treaty.  So Germany's dependence on Russian oil is not something to brag about!!!!!

4904 2018-07-11 16:46:12 Wild growth oil make your head itch so damn bad! I know I’m not the only person 
4905 2018-07-11 16:46:09 Baby oil. Oh no
4906 2018-07-11 16:46:01 If she's banging the pool boy she doesn't get half.
4907 2018-07-11 16:45:51 They're Republicans and have been known to 'sell out' to oil companies and the tax fraud bill. Don't count on them just because they're women. Both of them are just as corrupt as the men.

4911 2018-07-11 16:45:43 What about oil and gasoline not major for energy production but transportation and it’s still taken in from Russia
4912 2018-07-11 16:45:39 Wow amazing, Tea tree oil in half cup of milk poured into your bath natural antiseptic does not sting, in case you need it after birth, Senecot helps soften stools, pee in shower. All great tips just after birth and for a few days until you heal xx
4913 2018-07-11 16:45:37 There is no Nato fund. Every nation pays money for their own military. 
By the way, it's not about oil but gas.
Not the same thing.
4914 2018-07-11 16:45:36 Lol, don’t be a product junkie. Just one good moisturizing shampoo, conditioner, twisting/braiding cream, and a good oil is all you need. Protective styling helps the transition process go by quicker too.
4915 2018-07-11 16:45:35 Germany gets 36% of its natural gas & 39% of its oil from Russia, with completion of the pipeline that number will increase to 75%....that’s a problem for NATO
4916 2018-07-11 16:45:26 But we get oil from Saudi Arabia. That would mean we are controlled by the Saudis.

Oh, wait...

4918 2018-07-11 16:45:06 @ToyotaofOrlando just took 2 1/2 hours to change my oil because of lack of communication. It’s the first time they annoyed me but it’s funny how you can go from raving about a place to raging about it because someone forgot to tell someone something. #notmad anymore
4919 2018-07-11 16:44:55 The guys doing my oil change all watch Dragonball and we’re just chilling talking about super and the Broly movie lol this is great
4920 2018-07-11 16:44:47 Cleansing oil/milk/water + facial wash/foam + toner
4921 2018-07-11 16:44:43 It's a pretty simple concept to understand Marcia.  You realize that oil is available elsewhere and natural gas only makes up 20% of Germanys power consumption.  The US imports 60% of our oil, so by your standard are we captive to Canada and Saudi Arabia?
4922 2018-07-11 16:44:40 We need to be nice to them we may need their assistance at anytime.  They have until 2024 to make changes.  I agree on Nordstream 2 they should cancel this and seek oil from a Democratic government and work torward energy independence.

4924 2018-07-11 16:44:18 I mean I agree that our troops shouldn't be there but you can't blame Germany for buying the closest and cheapest oil they can.  As I said before, most of Europe does, and that's just because Russia has a ton of natural resources.
4925 2018-07-11 16:44:16 It’s snake oil.
4926 2018-07-11 16:44:09 and as expected...here comes Rafa #Wimbledon

Given that we’re still here, it should be okay.
4928 2018-07-11 16:43:56 No. Thin crust. Goat’s cheese and roquito peppers and rocket. Splash of chilli oil. Garlic bread and wedges on the side.
4929 2018-07-11 16:43:53 it is only idiot that will talking of money missing in NNPC when reserves are rising despite low oil price. Use your head.
4930 2018-07-11 16:43:36 Yeah but I also use way more oil than it suggests. Next time I see them I’ll probably give them a proper try instead of being shitfaced and using sandwich bread lmao
4931 2018-07-11 16:43:35 i used oil based permanent markers so it wouldn’t come off if i ever washed them or whatnot
4932 2018-07-11 16:43:34 Where have you been?  US led the 1st Iraq War after Iraq invaded Kuwait 2 protect the world's oil supply.  Everyone joined in 4 the same reason.  US started the war in Afghanistan after the Taliban refused 2 cough up Osama Bin Laden after 9/11.  US started Iraq II bc we could.

4934 2018-07-11 16:43:30 Need to go to the grocery store and secure this avocado oil and coconut oil for some healthy fats 

Trying to phase out the bad oils from my diet now
4935 2018-07-11 16:43:15 Weaning Germany from Russian oil and natural gas and strengthening Western militaries is not an effort to 'fulfill Putin's dreams.  @JoeNBC is SO out of touch with reality.

4937 2018-07-11 16:43:03 So according to his logic, if Germany is controlled by Russia because it gets its energy from there, then the US is controlled by the Middle East because we get most of our oil from them... hmm
4938 2018-07-11 16:43:02 y did I forgot to buy olive oil and tersalah beli cheese ni oh my god irdina apenak jadi skarang nk kena twist2 recipe

4940 2018-07-11 16:42:40 Well that and while they are bilking  more $$$ from US to help defend them form Russia, who has no intention of attacking or invading EU, they then make Energy/Oil pipeline 'Deals' WITH Russia behind our back.
Trump is calling them out on this!
4941 2018-07-11 16:42:27 I hope this vitamin E oil helps my lashes grow. :/
4942 2018-07-11 16:42:13 Hearing  how “The glory fell”, being “blood-bought” ,  being “anointed with oil” being surveillance’d by a “cloud of witnesses”.. “breaking bread” ,  asking for a “double anointing” like it’s a video game power-up..
4943 2018-07-11 16:42:06 The web needs more of these posts and fewer snake oil posts.
4944 2018-07-11 16:42:04 Ah, so Trump wasn't saying what he meant, he was using hyperbolic statements to insult an ally? Wow...that sounds much better...we do get a majority of our oil from Canada and Mexico. Making us dependent on that energy. 

LOL! You didn't answer the question, of course.
4945 2018-07-11 16:42:03 Going several thousand miles past the recommended oil change mark rules
4946 2018-07-11 16:42:02 @realDonaldTrump Saudi Arabia remains to be one of the greatest violators of human rights in the world. 13 of the hijackers on 9/11 were Saudi. Yet they are the 2nd largest importer of oil into the U.S. #speakaboutthat

4950 2018-07-11 16:41:33 India shouldn't bow down to USA. It is Trump tactic to adopt protectionism for USA. India Iran goes long way in strategy and oil
4951 2018-07-11 16:41:25 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Speaking as a would-be Oil & Gas social media guy who rolls is eyes at what Trump just did to HRC's efforts as SoS, the problem with Propaganda, regardless of who does it, is that you often try way too hard.

Manufacture Consent, not Support. 

It's. 

That. 

Simple.
4952 2018-07-11 16:41:19 Bintik merah terus gatel gak? Kalo iya, coba pakein olive oil
4953 2018-07-11 16:41:19 South australia and germany are in a mess becos of these renewables. The word industrialisation and renewables are like water and oil, they just dnt mix.
4954 2018-07-11 16:41:16 Okay look the only reason I commented on the first place is because I don’t like when people try to mix these two things together. It’s oil and water. If your gonna believe in god, you have to accept that homosexuality isn’t accepted. Don’t try and say that god loves you anyway
4955 2018-07-11 16:41:16 Since the US gets 40 % of its oil from Canada that is like saying  controls the US !
4956 2018-07-11 16:41:13 Concerns over global growth and the consumption of oil slowdown..
4957 2018-07-11 16:41:07 Obviously ROXXON! They’re behind Cloak&Dagger’s powers and that oil rig explosion I think. They have to be the main villains!
4958 2018-07-11 16:41:04 If you gone wear sandals “Oil that heel up” now enjoy love!

4960 2018-07-11 16:41:01 Asking NATO to pay their fair share HASN'T worked. 
More absurd is Germany paying billions to Russia for oil and gas while asking US to pay more to help defend them from - you guessed it - Russia.
Nice hasn't worked. Maybe tough will.

4961 2018-07-11 16:40:55 “Idc if a women, breaks all your car windows, burns your house down, push down your mom, poured hot grits on you while you’re asleep, covered the bathroom floor with baby oil and beat your ass like a child when you got out the shower. You NEVER put your hands on a woman”


4962 2018-07-11 16:40:49 It if you'd like but it seems like you're not understanding his strategy. He wants no tariffs at all and the same as with his criticism of Germany regarding the Russian oil he's simply saying that if it's ok for yoy then why can't the US do it as well. If you'd like I can expand
4963 2018-07-11 16:40:45 Yes please. I've got some Boots Sun Swim & Gym conditioner and some Argan Oil so far.
4964 2018-07-11 16:40:42 glad my car is running again after almost 3 years. now I just need to fix the oil leak and plan an interview and hopefully get the job so I can move.
4965 2018-07-11 16:40:40 Not good for your engine over the life of the car. It will cause sludge build up. GET THE OIL CHANGED ASAP.
4966 2018-07-11 16:40:37 @Acosta Guess it makes sense that someone who rarely reports with truth. Would call truth telling a slam ! They should stop buying Russian oil/gas like Poland. It's dangerous for all of us that any NATO member is dependent on Russia
4967 2018-07-11 16:40:35 What business of yours is it where they buy their oil, only reason you’re complaining is because the money isn’t going in your pocket!!
4968 2018-07-11 16:40:34 It was long overdue.
4969 2018-07-11 16:40:33 Weaning Germany from Russian oil/natural gas and strengthening Western militaries is not *exactly* what Putin wants.  You are out of touch with reality.
4970 2018-07-11 16:40:33 Future of US oil&gas (if indeed fracking is sustainable????) is North-South trade.

4976 2018-07-11 16:40:01 You could certainly use olive oil and you probably could use butter (I haven't tested with either), but my guess is that you won't get the same sponge/crumb/texture. Play around and LMK what you do and what you think. Have fun!
4977 2018-07-11 16:39:52 
4978 2018-07-11 16:39:44 How is he helping Russia by asking Germany not to rely on buying oil and natural gas from them?
4979 2018-07-11 16:39:42 I think he's smelling the coconut oil in my hair.
4980 2018-07-11 16:39:29 Be careful if u get them tho bc they pop a lot in oil I think that’s what I got the burn on my hand from. They aren’t bad but I’d still rather have Morningstar
4981 2018-07-11 16:39:27 Care to explain how a government or anyone for that matter can hide oil?
4982 2018-07-11 16:39:22 Oya, recommend beard oil for us.
4983 2018-07-11 16:39:09 Just need an oil change, pick up my spare tire, and wait for the maintenance guys to spray the apartment and then it’s vacation time

4991 2018-07-11 16:38:39 BEST TWEET OF THE DAY

Ana Navarro:  “Trump tells NATO, Germany is controlled by Russia because that’s from where Germany gets its oil.
Ok, well, by that logic....
Trump is controlled by Russia because that’s from where Trump got his presidency.”
4992 2018-07-11 16:38:36 Se vier CHROMATEC, SATOR AREPO, CHROMAREPO, INSANE CREATURES E EVIL OIL MAN NA ECOLOGIC 13 ANOS , EU VOU NA FESTA, pode tirar print!
4993 2018-07-11 16:38:26 It is all about money oil, real estate all over the world Putin richest man in the world by the money he has and controls
4994 2018-07-11 16:38:24 Olive oil softens it up a little but I take the stems out cause that roughage is a lot
4995 2018-07-11 16:38:20 dnt wrry those r the oil filters ur bro don’t know what he saying
4996 2018-07-11 16:38:17 Bad example; Krim is Russia; less than 5% of Krimeans dispute this. It was not "outright conquest", but an uprising by the people of Krim. Far from "take their oil".
4997 2018-07-11 16:38:09 Just imagine taking photos of a girl like you, in a bikini, covered in oil WITHOUT jerking off or at least getting a bonner... it gotta be hard, not the bonner, the situation lol. 
Can we really blame them for being a little shady?
4998 2018-07-11 16:38:05 It's a dual pronged problem. In South American countries like Brazil, if you clear a piece of forest and put cows on it, you own it, including mineral rights. So if you think there's oil, you plop cows on it for a couple years. Then you drill.
4999 2018-07-11 16:37:57 Germany has the right to buy Russian oil. America has the right not to pay for their defense. @realDonaldTrump
5000 2018-07-11 16:37:44 So the gas and oil scam continues...stories made up to justify raising oil and gas prices for what's already available not for what is not yet bought.  How in the hell did we allow these crooks to steal from us with no oversight or holding them accountable for ruin lives.
5001 2018-07-11 16:37:40 This flies in the face of reality and facts.  Germany wants Soviet oil.  Trump doesn’t want that.

5003 2018-07-11 16:37:29 Right that's why he brought up the fact that Merkle is spending billions on a pipeline that will make Germany extremely dependent on Russia for oil (80-90%). So who is Putins puppet? Not Trump!
5004 2018-07-11 16:37:28 100% correct Jack: there are approx. 36'000 US GI's in Germany and more than a dozen US military bases, mostly in the south of Germany. We have to apologize to act as a sovereign country and buy gaz/oil from Russia which is 40-50% cheaper than yours.
5005 2018-07-11 16:37:26 Olive Tree of Israel be magnified in our souls and pour golden anointing oil of favor and blessings on ALL flesh! 
5006 2018-07-11 16:37:23 Did you listen to his comments? He chastised Germany for doing that huge oil deal with Russia.  He wasn’t saying that deal was a good thing.  Far from it.  Pay attention.
5007 2018-07-11 16:37:15 Why isn’t she upset that the US taxpayer is footing this big NATO bill and the fact that Germany uses their savings to purchase oil from Russia? She needs to stop speaking and THINK for once!
5008 2018-07-11 16:37:12 Tell me...what happens if #Russia decides to cut off all their #oil and natural gas exports to EU countries one of these cold winters to come? Europe never learns...repeating the same mistakes time and time again. #trumpiscorrect #NATO
5009 2018-07-11 16:37:10 De där echinacea-dropparna funkar, men man får ta mer än föreskrivet. Tea tree oil funkar också men samma där: rejält ska det vara! Fast. Det vetenskapliga är att vila och låta tiden ha sin gång :-)

5023 2018-07-11 16:36:09 NATO? The only reason NATO is still in existence is to give the US’ constant invasions some legitimacy!! Russia is trying to rebuild her economy whilst we spend billions slaughtering civilians & stealing oil - all for the military industrial complex & petrodollar...

5026 2018-07-11 16:35:54 The #UnitedStates is in NO POSITION to #admonish Germany about its' deal for a new gas pipeline w/Russia as long as we are getting oil from #SaudiArabia.
5027 2018-07-11 16:35:52 Every damn time I get my oil changed I end up paying for $200 “you said that part was gunna explode last time too but yes please fix that”
5028 2018-07-11 16:35:48 Where's your oil from? Are you "totally controlled" by Saudi Arabia?

5035 2018-07-11 16:35:34 Not equivalent. US is a net exporter. So US is not dependent or able to influenced based on that dependency. With Canada we import their heavier oil to mix with our lighter oil primarily so we can still use older refineries. But we export to them alot of lighter oil and Nat gas

5038 2018-07-11 16:35:19 You might want to see Trump's comments today to Germany regarding Russian oil.

I am pretty Putin does not like his puppet telling Germany to stop buying Putin's oil.

But hey - I know you have an explanation for this.

5041 2018-07-11 16:35:13 Now, mr. Sh*t Trump complains about the gas duct from Russia. Does he want to sell Nat gas to Europe and crude oil? He can't be a salesman. Would you all buy something from this man? He isn't a con artist, doesn't know how to con and convince.
5042 2018-07-11 16:35:07 fuck that oil shit, call me oldhead but rolling up is way better 
5043 2018-07-11 16:35:06 I'm not even a Red Sox fan, but my dream "30 for 30" style sports documentary would be "What Oil Can Boyd Did In the Hours After He Was Told He Wasn't Pitching Game Seven." @BillSimmons
5044 2018-07-11 16:35:04 No but should there be more investigations into her past? Wasn't Schroeder the one who set up this great deal and then went on to be the chairman of the oil company.  Who are we protecting them from? I say pulse our troops from Germany save money.
5045 2018-07-11 16:34:57 Did you not listen to the video at all?  Are you deaf?They are playing oil with Russian 70% &not paying dues for years then turning around want us to protect from Russia.We have let these things go so don’t look at OBama/Clinton getting rich in Iran. Only Presidents to go in poor
5046 2018-07-11 16:34:57 Lol, they are such hypocrits.  They complain no matter what Trump does.  I mean you could not get much harder on Russia than by shutting off their cash supply by shutting off their Oil flow into Europe
5047 2018-07-11 16:34:55 He is not mad he is right NATO is there to protect against Russian expansion and Germany has a oil pipeline from Russia
5048 2018-07-11 16:34:47 Trump heard Senate protected NATO with a 97 to 2 vote: He was right down Rude/Disrespectful to those At NATO Breakfast! He lied about what % of gas/oil Germany Buys from Russia!NATO had already Agreed they would pay GPD more up to 2.% we pay 3.2% an now trump wants them to pay 4%

5055 2018-07-11 16:34:28 Really so you tell me the planet has 198 countries supposed the top 10 in quality are eurpean socialist and the first producer of oil is like that because western states ..Sorry but we have more the 100 fail socialist .

5059 2018-07-11 16:34:10 What your country does concerning economic decisions and who they trade with is not really the business of My country.  NATO is an alliance designed to support each other against determined enemies.  American buys it's oil from the middle east.
5060 2018-07-11 16:33:57 Then buy some!! I can’t have coconut oil so I don’t have many options
5061 2018-07-11 16:33:39 My dad was changing my oil and putting air in my tires after a 15 hour shift. I told him I was going to the atm to get the $$ I owe him & he handed me $20. I wonder why I have high standards
5062 2018-07-11 16:33:37 If you watch the video of President Trump it’s exactly the opposite of what she said. Germany bought $11 billion worth of natural gas and oil from Russia. He said it’s a disgrace, that they should not be buying from Russia.
5063 2018-07-11 16:33:35 At the first meeting of the Oireachtas Committee on Climate Action. Radical action will be needed on energy, transport and agriculture. That means tackling the interests of big oil and agri-business. You have to be red to be green.

5067 2018-07-11 16:33:04 Russia Watch: Yesterday Bloomberg reported that oil issues were now expected to come up at the Trump/Putin closed doors meeting. This is a change from prior U.S. comments that oil wasn't going to come up. 1/2
5068 2018-07-11 16:33:04 You're comparing apples and oranges. Germany is buying Russian oil and gas thus supporting them and their army. The US does buy from China unfortunately that's just not going to change and it's not bc of Trump that this happened. You said the debt is the problem, if anything it

5070 2018-07-11 16:32:49 Getting my oil changed and they took my keys. Pretty smart
5071 2018-07-11 16:32:46 I’d almost rather not change my oil than have the people ask me 1 million questions about cars.
5072 2018-07-11 16:32:43 I think that Cannabis oil can be used for dogs.  Cannabis oil successfully kills all types of cancer in humans.

5074 2018-07-11 16:32:34 Gmny imports 40% of their natural gas and 35% of their oil from Russia. The hypocrisy of Trump voters is astounding. Many of my family members are Trump supporters and they incessantly talked, and continue to talk, about the dishonesty of HRC and Obama.
5075 2018-07-11 16:32:31 Firefighters should be posted or have their units around oil and gas sectors. Bear this in mind when visiting these firms.
5076 2018-07-11 16:32:31 Strange, I just heard President Trump tell leaders of NATO that Germany’s dependence on Russian oil and gas is a security risk. Russia would lose billions if the purchases were to stop. How would that help Moscow?
5077 2018-07-11 16:32:30 It’s the first time I’ve gotten an oil change since trading in my Audi & I forgot how much cheaper service on American cars is. Yes lawd.
5078 2018-07-11 16:32:29 Oil Prices fell more than $2 a barrel after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to levy new tariffs on China and Libya announced the reopening of key oil export terminals.

5083 2018-07-11 16:32:02 Esa propuesta es muy lógica. Pero tiene un problema: de un litro de petroleo - digamos - se puede sacar un porcentaje de nafta y otro porcentaje de gas oil. Y se estira poco. Entonces te entra a sobrar nafta. Que se exporta , pero no es tan fácil.

5087 2018-07-11 16:31:51 Why @CNN is no longer a news organization:
Germany/NATO are asking to be protected against Russia, but then depends on Oil from their So-Called Enemy, Russia.
Where is the logic?
**Why did you feel the need to report on John Kelly drinking water??
**How is that news?
5088 2018-07-11 16:31:44 So Germany gets 40% of it's oil, 30% of it's coal AND well over 50% of all it's Natural Gas from Russia.....you are wrong and just trying to pander, Germany totally RELIES on Russia for it's Energy resources...what are you saying? lol
5089 2018-07-11 16:31:43 Just ordered a 4-pack of @gravebeforeshave beard oil. You can say things are getting pretty serious.
5090 2018-07-11 16:31:40 Trump Trade War will Directly hit"OUR"Farmers!Trump working against Security of our Country w/treating NATO like Dirt! Lie about % of Gas/Oil Germany gets from Russia!We pay NATO 3.2%&now he wants poorer countries pay 4%cause he's pissed off Senate protected NATO w/ 97 to 2 vote!
5091 2018-07-11 16:31:39 I fasho can change my oil lol my mom taught me how to do that
5092 2018-07-11 16:31:38 As I said the other day, some people want fucking oil paintings of themselves. Cuz they think they're monarchs or some shit 
5093 2018-07-11 16:31:38 Mau nanya, cleansing oil nya itu mksd nya make up yg berbahan dasar oil atau pembersih oil?

5096 2018-07-11 16:31:13 Also the EU don't take all your tax revenue as a fee, hide 45% of your oil resourses in other regions and prevent you building a $1 trillion wealth fund.
5097 2018-07-11 16:31:05 He is not buying Russian oil.  Germany is
5098 2018-07-11 16:31:04 When innovation is not encouraged and small enterprises are not given boost all the money ends in big hands. This is dangerous for Indias well being as we can see Reliance grp backing from taking Iran Oil while India govt might wants to follow another policy.

5102 2018-07-11 16:30:52 Think about it. I did my research after seeing ARC trials in Bathurst early 2004. It's a cash crop with a variety of uses (hurd, fibre, seed, oil, bud). It cleans polluted soil and needs rotating only after 14 years. Doesn't need particularly special care or products to grow it.
5103 2018-07-11 16:30:49 Combine 2 tablespoons Graham crackers with 8 oz Garlic. Mix in Olive Oil. Drain. Serve on salad
5104 2018-07-11 16:30:44 They get both. However, it’s much cheaper exporting over sea then building  a pipeline through mid Europe with ......Russia, because what happens when Russia turns that oil off? Germany’s screwed. L
5105 2018-07-11 16:30:42 Oil is dirty but the money from it ain’t too bad
5106 2018-07-11 16:30:39 The gain was on the mandate to countries Not to import oil from Iran  - tariffs are a negative factor
5107 2018-07-11 16:30:38 I almost just commented on a picture saying I have the same oil diffuser but then realized no one cares
5108 2018-07-11 16:30:38 I can't go without body oil in the summer it keeps my skin beautifully nourished and my body relaxed from therapeutic blends #Comp
5109 2018-07-11 16:30:36 It's tough for India as all the oil companies are state owned, and it is a very big pic with plenty of grey in it. The detailing of the picture shows less and hides more.
5110 2018-07-11 16:30:29 “We’re protecting...everybody” we’re also the ones going to war and asking our allies to fight too. And we’re buds with Saudi Arabia, asking them to increase oil production to make Trump look better but most of the 9/11 terrorists were Saudis.

5119 2018-07-11 16:30:07 
5120 2018-07-11 16:30:05 your statement makes no sense.  It appears to me that Trump is slamming Russia for selling oil to Germany
5121 2018-07-11 16:29:57 Nahh Oil Fields, Permian Basin
5122 2018-07-11 16:29:42 Why don’t you promote renewable energy and quit spouting ridiculous messages. Be a positive change. We are still oil and gas reliant. Change comes slowly and shouldn’t have to be at the expense of a certain group.
5123 2018-07-11 16:29:37 Drop in prices for items isn't always because of barriers/tariffs. If supply increases then prices drop. If demand goes up prices follow. Soy beans are down but you recently complained that oil prices were up. It's called supply and demand - i.e. the basis of our entire economy
5124 2018-07-11 16:29:32 Consider it this way, what happens if Russia suddenly invades in the Baltics while Germany is still getting 60% of its oil from Russia? It compromises their position and makes allies doubt their sincerity.
5125 2018-07-11 16:29:25 Dang, did you even listen. Point blank we are paying 43.2% and Germany 1% what about that confuses you? At the same time they are getting richer from oil deals with the Russians, who by the way are NOT our Allies!
5126 2018-07-11 16:29:23 And his tire completely blew out all the way around the rim. It was literally gaping open all the way around and we had to get him a tire too. But it’s the story of my life i need repairs RIGHT NOW. know anything about holes in oil pans and quick fixes?
5127 2018-07-11 16:29:21 Snake oil doesn’t work. His shit does.

5132 2018-07-11 16:28:45 I don't see it "disaster-laden". I see European leaders failing to to meet up their Nato budget, of the 29 countries only 4 spend the 2% Iceland spend 0.1 % or Canada 1%. Plus EU importing 32% of its Oil+38% of its Gas from Russia. some EU member states depend on Russian gas 100%
5133 2018-07-11 16:28:33 Trump is correct in pointing out the strategic idiocy Germany is commiting with making itself so dependent on Russian gas and oil. Germany needs to diversify suppliers and get back on the nuclear train, something the US can help with.
5134 2018-07-11 16:28:32 Terbahagia make brush yg abis dibersihin terus masih wangi olive oil....rasaknya tuuuuuhhhh ga mau dipake sampe bila bila

I juga cuci u punya brushes.... ur most welcome @Zhrfrdsy
5135 2018-07-11 16:28:28 Germany only gets 20% of their oil from Russia; US gets whopping 60% of our oil frm Canada, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, etc; are we controlled by them?? Drumpf foolish 2say Germany 'controlled' by Russia when US also relies on other countries for oil/gas; just an excuse to bash NATO
5136 2018-07-11 16:28:28 Plus, he's lying.

Germany imports natl gas.
USA imports oil.
5137 2018-07-11 16:28:18 and we have our answer...yes he can!!! What a performance and to do it from two sets down is incredible. #Wimbledon
5138 2018-07-11 16:28:14 I think he rubs a lot of people the wrong way. He’s ambitious but he’s also a bit of a snake oil salesman.
5139 2018-07-11 16:28:08 I think it's natural gas, not oil and LNG is much harder to ship and deliver. There has to be a huge investment in infrastructure both in the US and Europe for that to happen. I'm not an LNG expert but I'd be curious to know if it's feasible or reasonable

5145 2018-07-11 16:27:11 Did your Lord say he saw Russia as a competitor and not an enemy? By his reasoning, we are empowering China w/all the things we buy from them, and the people we buy oil from.

5148 2018-07-11 16:27:02 None of your business where we buy our oil!
Didn't you hear we overtaken France to become the 6th largest economy.
5149 2018-07-11 16:26:58 And by Canada because that’s where Trump gets his oil. He best be kind.
5150 2018-07-11 16:26:56 Usual two faced behavior by Germany. Attacking Russia over the Crimea on one hand while buying oil and gas with the other.
5151 2018-07-11 16:26:40 & they intend to get every drop of blood before.
Do you really think a person who own Russian oil wants it to stay under ice?
Drill it all, warm it up, get the oil you couldn't before. Shipping lanes etc. They want the arctic to be the center of the world because Russia.
5152 2018-07-11 16:26:40 “Oil and gas industry”.  I’m betting Brian loved him some Scott Pruitt.

5154 2018-07-11 16:26:32 LOL. Also, don’t forget, The USA is in thrall to Canada and Saudi Arabia as well due to buying their oil. Yes, Canadians, those bad hombres!
5155 2018-07-11 16:26:31 I use fresh aloe, & I'll treat it like a heated leave in conditioner. I don't like using too many oils because it's easy for it to oversaturate my hair cuz I have a softer texture. 

If anything jojoba,  a drop of castor, Moroccan argan oil, coconut water & fresh aloe. Blend it
5156 2018-07-11 16:26:26 IMO he was vomiting bullshit about Germany and Russian pipeline as an excuse to get out of NATO. It will be Germany does business with Russia. Therefore no need for NATO. You can’t be scared of Russia if you use their oil/gas. 
5157 2018-07-11 16:26:26 थोड़े दिनों बाद indian oil और हिंदुस्तान पेट्रोलियम भी बन्द हो कर पेट्रोल सिर्फ रिलायंस पेट्रोल पंप पर बिका करेगा ।#BikGayiGormint
5158 2018-07-11 16:26:26 What gives Putin the upper hand is Germany giving Putin billions for oil and gas and becoming dependent on Russia. Germany is literally funding Putin's aggression while failing epically in funding its own defense from Putin's aggression expecting US tax payers to foot the bill.
5159 2018-07-11 16:26:25 Do they attach the bases on those trophies nowadays????
5160 2018-07-11 16:26:16 Assuming no oil leaks, then the oil level would have to be lower than the last time it was measured. Definite way to confirm an oil leak is seeing fresh oil spots under your parked car after it’s been sitting there a while.
5161 2018-07-11 16:26:01 Trump never said that ... I heard what he said , he said , Germany  relies on Russia for oil and gas , so why should the USA  HAVE TO PROTECT GERMANY FROM Russia
5162 2018-07-11 16:25:55 Is there a reason you fail to note he’s calling out Germany for their plan to join Russia in building a pipeline for Russian oil? Kinda destroys your collusion narrative, doesn’t it?

5166 2018-07-11 16:25:33 Part of the reason the West can't take action against Russia is their dependency on Russian oil.  Where did you get the idea that we are "protecting" them from Russia?

5173 2018-07-11 16:24:54 That’s the point. It’s been delayed for so long....until now. Why are you going through with this when we can supply you with oil, he feels it’s a slap in the face
5174 2018-07-11 16:24:50 But are you sure it's the military budget that allows them to have socialized services, and not the oil wealth or human capital? I'm all for them paying for their own defense, but you don't know that Norway won't be able to do both.
5175 2018-07-11 16:24:50 Tire yes, oil no.

5179 2018-07-11 16:24:36 Our #StableGenius completely embarrassed himself once again, blathering on about Germany and Russian oil. Nearly 40 percent of all energy consumed in Germany comes from renewable sources with the rest coming from coal, nuclear, and natural gas. #TrumpIsAMoron
5180 2018-07-11 16:24:29 Hey Trumplet; Germany only gets 20% total energy frm Russia & it's privately financed. US domestically produces only 40% of oil; are we 'controlled' by Canada Saudi, Mexico, Venezuela &Nigeria bcuz we get 60% of oil from them?Trump not justified 2say Germany controlled by Russia!
5181 2018-07-11 16:24:28 Lier Chris. Are u prode of your self trying to cause chaos in America? PTrump just embarrassed Germany for buying oil gas from Russia undermining our sanctions on Russia making them richer who side you on?
5182 2018-07-11 16:24:26 After a long meeting, Mike Huckabee admits to Melania that oil executives are not really worth the time. Scottie Nell Hughes develops an addiction.
5183 2018-07-11 16:24:26 1. What’s your basis that the BBB program will enhance the economy and how does it affect inflation more than TRAIN?
2. Rising oil prices are well within the forecast of BSP. You mean BSP is incompetent? Lol
5184 2018-07-11 16:24:20 Please point out where I said that? Oh, you can't. Stop lying about what I say. I am saying that you cannot depend on oil for any significant income - not after Swinney begged Osborne to slash the tax take on oil, which Osborne obligingly did.

5186 2018-07-11 16:23:58 Here's a tidbit: Trump and his business partners want to deplete U.S. oil. Why? Because they're HEAVILY invested in Russian oil, and once U.S. oil is low/depleted, they'll be set.

It would seem that you misunderstand what the word "truth" is defined as. 

Does Canada own Washington based on oil needs? Huh.

Also, why does Trump need to run off to have a no records meeting with Putin?
5200 2018-07-11 16:23:24 American citizens are thankful that the #Nato meeting has exposed Germany is buying oil from Putin! Isn’t #Transparency what we are all due? #NATOSummit2018

5205 2018-07-11 16:23:11 @KennethPGreen, when you quote oil prices use the global currency. WCS $US53 about $Can70. Misleading to say 70$ without qualifier.
5206 2018-07-11 16:23:08 The point is, while #BarackObama was leveling sanctions on Russia Germany was filling Russia's coffers with money via the gas and oil deal. That's the facts.

 Trump was doing the right thing.  You don't get it.  He told Germany like it is Russia will control Oil coming to Germany.   It was a thing of beauty watching @realDonaldTrump   holding her feet to the fire. To bad you had to hide it from your 54 viewers.  Lol
5215 2018-07-11 16:22:34 Germany is buying oil from Russia,  yet,  U.S. taxdollars are being used to defend Germany.

5228 2018-07-11 16:21:57 Dems demand additional sanctions against Russia but are silent on Germany purchasing oil and natural gas from them. This causes the sanctions to be in affective, essentially a wash. Get on board Dems and stop resisting.

5230 2018-07-11 16:21:43 The problem is the neither side is presenting an actual solution to our problems. There are two things as a province we need to. Increase taxes and reduce spending.

5241 2018-07-11 16:20:54 The fact is Germany doubled their imports on oil from Russia while not paying their 2% to NATO who is supposed to protect European countries from Russia. America is not the World Police force. If Germany doesn't want to pay for their defense then they shouldn't get any.
5242 2018-07-11 16:20:49 So telling EU countries to reduce their dependence on Russia oil and gas is Putin’s plan?
5243 2018-07-11 16:20:42 inflation is mostly caused by 2 factors 1, his build build build projects which will enhance our economy in d future! 2, the WORLD OIL PRICE HIKE which digong has nothing to do with it.

5280 2018-07-11 16:18:31 Wait ?! How do I know if I burn oil or not 
5281 2018-07-11 16:18:29 He lied. Germany imports about 91 tonnes of crude oil a year. Only 36  million tonnes or 40% comes from Russia. Russia does not "totally own"  Germany. Germany gets 11 million tonnes from Norway & 9.1 from the  UK. Over 30 countries supply oil to Germany. That's how trade works.
5282 2018-07-11 16:18:28 Germany is captive to Russia because it buys Russian natural gas, the way the USA continues to be captive to Saudi Arabia by buying Saudi oil. Otherwise what is the US Fifth Fleet for?

5284 2018-07-11 16:18:17 Why can't Germany buy natural gas (at an enormously higher cost) from Trump's friends in the US oil & gas business? Sounds logical.

5288 2018-07-11 16:18:07 He is trying to sell American oil. Doesn’t care about the environmental damage that shipping it will do.

5302 2018-07-11 16:16:37 Cheeto is so annoying. He jumps down Germany’s throat for being controlled by Russian oil but did anyone inform you Cheeto that we are controlled by Saudi Arabia cause they give us oil?!  if you really want to make America great, let’s not be controlled for oil.
5303 2018-07-11 16:16:36 Yes Germany agreed to a new pipeline with Russia, to be completed in 2019. I think the point trump is making is we’re going to have a military alliance just so Germany could buy its oil from Russia?
5304 2018-07-11 16:16:34 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...

5308 2018-07-11 16:16:20 Trump is the ONLY one in my life time that has questioned why is trade so uneven I have been to the EU you DONT see Fords or Chevys but u see Toyota’s here in ? Why? Trade? Now the one industry we do have the snowflakes are going after it now “OIL” Never Trumpers & DNC...
5309 2018-07-11 16:16:11 387 wants an oil change *SQUAWK*
5310 2018-07-11 16:16:10 Yet, the Dems want to condemn Pres Trump or his administration if they even talk to a Russian, let alone buy oil.  Your argument has been turned on its head.

5312 2018-07-11 16:15:53 Germany helps keep Putin’s economy on life support by buying its gas and oil, while it looks to the U.S. taxpayers for protection against Russia. #pathetic

5314 2018-07-11 16:15:45 hey man as far as I'm concerned if you don't commission some oil paintings of pokemon you're wasting your life
5315 2018-07-11 16:15:42 Brilliant US pays to defend Germany against Russian in return Germany snubs US oil& gas buys from Russia a complete disgrace. Defend ur selves we’ve had enough of EU double dealing We’re no longer the asses we’ve been 4 60 yrs #MAGA
5316 2018-07-11 16:15:40 Same can be said of any/all of the alphabet soup agencies.
5317 2018-07-11 16:15:39 Baba please can you make it 2milli for just me and my babe.. if u give me I go buy one gp tank of anointing oil take pray for you. 
5318 2018-07-11 16:15:38 Heard it on MSNBC this morning. Was 20% but solar use increased in 2017 therefore dropping the % of crude oil & gas use. I can't rewind but that's where I heard it.
5319 2018-07-11 16:15:37 Pics of these oil fields have been shown on occasion but they never seem to get picked up by MSM. Mmmm...wonder why not?
5320 2018-07-11 16:15:35 what would happen to germany if russia cut off their gas and oil? So who controls who?
5321 2018-07-11 16:15:29 ก็ออยไงคะ5555555555
5322 2018-07-11 16:15:25 It’s the governor, that is the main reason for the increase in gas prices. President has asked for more oil to be produced. Let’s hope he can get it... agreed gas too high
5323 2018-07-11 16:15:19 I need to get one more wax melter and oil diffuser
5324 2018-07-11 16:15:19 2014, is when they agreed to it. It’s 2018 & only 5 are doing it, if you really think they are going to reach that mark you are misguided. We pay ~75% that is ridiculous & for GER to make a deal with RUS for a Gas/Oil Pipeline? The people we are supposed to protect them against!
5325 2018-07-11 16:15:17 What happens when we buy oil from Saudi Arabia? Those in involved with 911 were from that country. Fox News Russian state  propaganda machine is dealing out misinformation trying to divide Americans and it’s allies #InvestigateFoxNews

5330 2018-07-11 16:14:55 So @POTUS told all NATO nations to not buy Russian oil and gas trying to destroy the Russian and Germany pipeline deal.  Trump wants them buying OUR oil and gas,  but Trump is Putin's puppet.
5331 2018-07-11 16:14:55 Or protecting his boy, Vlad! Who do you people think is profiting from pulling out of the Iran Deal? Where did the oil come from, now that it is not Iran? You peywill believe anything!!!
5332 2018-07-11 16:14:54 If only Germany would purchase natural gas from the US, at a far greater expense. (Something we would never do simply to support an ally.) I wonder if Trump has any friends in the oil & gas business who would benefit from this...hmmm.
5333 2018-07-11 16:14:44 We buy oil from Saudi Arabia. The wonderful country that gave us 15 of the 19 9/11 terrorists.
5334 2018-07-11 16:14:44 I was thinking of Rex Tillerson...wasn’t he the executive of Exxon in Russia?...I believe..and wasn’t he pushing to free American sanctions so that oil productions would be more lucrative for Russia.?
5335 2018-07-11 16:14:43 I truly do wish that Trump would take his own advice about Russia.  How many years has he been trying to forge personal business ties in Russia...with Putin...who happens to be the singular person who benefits most from Russian oil revenue.
5336 2018-07-11 16:14:43 Why are we using U.S. taxdollars to defend Germany, when Germany is buying oil from Russia?   Does that make any sense?
5337 2018-07-11 16:14:37 Nazi Germany’s long term goals always involved war on the Soviet Union and taking the oil and arable land of the east. They wanted food and energy independence. Stalin, after the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, was the main provider of food and fuel to Nazi Germany.

5344 2018-07-11 16:14:05 It's a bit rich Trump attacking Germany for trading with Russia in oil.

In 2018 alone the US has imported 38,602 thousand barrels of Crude Oil and Petroleum Products.

In 2017 it was 140,296 thousand barrels.
5345 2018-07-11 16:14:02 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump  is the US beholding to Venezuela as 7% of your oil imports come from there.

5350 2018-07-11 16:13:52 Somebody lunch smell like spoiled motor oil .....
5351 2018-07-11 16:13:46 We must end this fake oil commodity market. We cannot allow the world economy to be contingent on one thing. We also must be less reliant on oil. It's not just an environmental issue, it's an economic issue and national security issue.
5352 2018-07-11 16:13:44 The American people you r talking about is the top 1% because us working stiffs think your agenda sucks Our air is dirtier our water is more contaminated our national parks are being used by big oil or shrunk gerrymandering has become the norm women are losing our rights etc etc
5353 2018-07-11 16:13:43 Isn't oil bought on the open market in US $'s? Why would Angola sell to us for less than it can get on the open market? The same applies to Sasol. SA must accept it deals with the global market. Cyril completely lies to citizens and avoids discussing the taxes and levies.

5356 2018-07-11 16:13:20 At best BoC keeps up with FED.  US growth has strengthened while Canada is slowing down.  Add the threat of tariffs, while OIL is helping Canada its offsetting consumer spending weakness.
5357 2018-07-11 16:13:11 All the pressure from the American public via their state reps on @realDonaldTrump  to increase sanctions on Russia doesn't have much of an effect when Germany continues to pump money into the Russian economy by buying oil from them while NOT paying their AGREED amount into NATO!
5358 2018-07-11 16:13:09 CHECK IT OUT:

GERMANY is crying about Trump being mean...but the former Prime Minister of Germany sits on the board of the RUSSIAN OIL COMPANY that they buy oil from...instead of us.  

RUSSIA CONTROLS GERMANY.

5360 2018-07-11 16:12:46 And russia because we get oil from there too and were controlled by Saudi too i assume
5361 2018-07-11 16:12:40 Correction: Germany imports about 91 tonnes of crude oil a year. Only 36 million tonnes or 40% comes from Russia. Russia does now "totally own" Germany. Germany gets 11 million tonnes from Norway & 9.1 from the UK. Over 30 countries supply oil to Germany. That's how trade works.
5362 2018-07-11 16:12:37 Who would you like them to get energy from?  They are #1 in solar in the world. Where exactly would you like them to get oil?
5363 2018-07-11 16:12:32 I've hared that Iran has some oil to sell.
5364 2018-07-11 16:12:22 What if Russia decides to stop sending them oil..what will they do?
5365 2018-07-11 16:12:13 Sorry we don't have oil money
5366 2018-07-11 16:12:12 The guy makes a claim that only people who were citizens could go to school there.  He fails to support his claim.  There was no requirement for kids to have citizenship to go to school there.  There are a number of international schools there going back to the 50s
5367 2018-07-11 16:12:11 Obviously, Nancy's going to increase the supply of oil by encouraging more drilling...

5375 2018-07-11 16:11:48 watching this reality trucking show on netflix and they're trying to make it dramatic, like "they need to get the truck out without dumping the oil in the small stream." Seriously I came here to watch people pull a car out of a ditch this doesn't have to be HBO.
5376 2018-07-11 16:11:47 Hydraulic fracturing, or 'fracking', has transformed oil and gas production in the US, allowing the industry to tap previously inaccessible reserves in shale rock. 
 'The natural gas boom has led to cleaner power and greater energy independence. We need to encourage that.'
5377 2018-07-11 16:11:46 I agree if POTUS doesn’t want conspiracies to evolve and to assure his base he should not meet Putin alone. 2nd it’s too coincidental that POTUS opens up summit with the Russian oil angle after Congress passes the vote of support & folks talking against meeting Putin alone.

5381 2018-07-11 16:11:40 @realDonaldTrump Agree with you 100% . We pay 4% of GDP to protect Europe from Russia, but yet these countries (Germany etc. ) have a direct pipeline to Russia purchasing their oil. Sounds like some individuals are getting rich in a way on our dime. Merkel.
5382 2018-07-11 16:11:38 President Trump says we're supposed to protect Germany but Germany is buying billions of dollars of oil and natural gas from Russia explain this to me 
5383 2018-07-11 16:11:33 We buy all our rare metals from China.  These are used in technology in military.  We import 40% oil much from our new national enemies under Trump, Canada and Mexico.
5384 2018-07-11 16:11:32 Germany imports natl gas.
USA imports oil from Arabia and others

Germany is a world leader in developing alternative energy
Trumpy hates it

5386 2018-07-11 16:11:29 If Germany is buying energy from Russia while the USA is spending money to protect Europe from Russia, then my friend,  it is Germany that is an Embarrassment. The US either needs to pull out of NATO, or Germany needs to buy oil from the USA.

Don’t you find it pathetic to talk to your allies like this? My cousin died in Afghanistan for an US war..

Germans are colliding and enriching certain politicians.
5399 2018-07-11 16:10:35 The suit failed.  So again nonsense.  There's never been proof Obama was an indonesian citizen.  Indonesian embassy denies it.  Nowhere does that back up your claim that in his book his parents "relinquished his citizenship" Parents can't do that.

5408 2018-07-11 16:10:15 Somebody on Fox just said Trump bringing up Germany and Russian oil was brilliant. I cannot cannot cannot believe the people on Fox are that stupid.

5411 2018-07-11 16:09:53 One may ask, where does Trump get HIS OIL FROM ??

5419 2018-07-11 16:09:11 So Russia and Canada are equally dangerous? wow, thats a new twist. Our existing refineries are setup for heavy oil (from mexico and canada), the US produces light oil which means refineries infrastructure just needs an update to be energy independent.
5420 2018-07-11 16:09:06 .@CNN .@DanaBashCNN curious, if #Germany is a captive of #Russia because of reliance on #Russian oil, what does that say about the nations reliant on purchasing US oil? Are those nations “captives” of the United States? Sounds like #Trump’s argument. #NATOSummit
5421 2018-07-11 16:09:06 You are disagreeing with lying Trump, your leader., First he attacks Germany for getting oil from Putin, then claims Germany is wonderful & Merkel & he r pals.

5426 2018-07-11 16:08:59 Also pressed like they're trying to make oil.
5427 2018-07-11 16:08:54 Start taking multi vitamins wwith added zinc. Use castor oil mixed with any other hair oil like mustard or olive or coconut oil
5428 2018-07-11 16:08:54 It's long coming from the EU bigweights like German. It's more like bigger and badass player in doing the public bashing of countries with "their own prismed" human rights. But go behind to do big trade deals in OIL, GAS etc. Major EU countries have same paddle in Iran's boat.

5430 2018-07-11 16:08:48 in Siria while Germany is sending billions of euros to them for oil and gas, in effect funding their military aggression, while failing to meet NATO obligations. It's ridiculous and it's time for certain countrys in Europe to step up.
5431 2018-07-11 16:08:43 He’s just trying to sell American oil. He can’t see past trade. Alliances mean nothing to him.
5432 2018-07-11 16:08:41 HOW is POTUS more loyal to Putin when telling Germany that while we pay into NATO to protect THEM from Russia THEY turn around & enrich Russia by putting in an oil pipeline to obtain oil from Russia b/c Germany
5433 2018-07-11 16:08:31 Do you use a toner prior to applying WunderBrow? Also, be sure that none of your make up or face wash/soaps are oil based!

5434 2018-07-11 16:08:22 To keep his master and all of USSR's oil all to himself.
5435 2018-07-11 16:08:17 My dad bought butter flavored coconut oil so now when I put butter and coconut oil in my coffee it mostly just tastes like butter -_-
5436 2018-07-11 16:08:13 One last bit of context: The global drug trade, like the global oil trade, is done almost exclusively in USD's.
5437 2018-07-11 16:07:56 In 2017, Russia appointed Schroeder to serve as an independent director of the board of its biggest oil producer Rosneft with a salary of $350,000 for the part-time post.

Rosneft is the third largest company in Russia and the second most valuable after Gazprom.
5438 2018-07-11 16:07:53 THE SQUIRRELS with the FULL BLESSING of my first cat seymour have been FIXING oil prices how long do they think they can hide that
5439 2018-07-11 16:07:45 Trump is trying to cut Russia off from billions while increasing our sales of oil. How can you NOT support that? It’s hysterical hate.

5441 2018-07-11 16:07:37 So Trump slags off Germany for Russian oil...yet he wants Russia back in the G group, is holding a 1 on 1 with Putin. Oh, and as for America protecting everyone else? It’s been all the other allies coming to pull America out of its war messes, and backing the US after 9/11.

5446 2018-07-11 16:07:22 Yes, I hope @realDonaldTrump draws nexus that EU countries who buy oil & gas from Putin are financing his military aggression in Eastern Europe, Mideast & South America. @WhiteHouse @VP @DeptofDefense @StateDept @seanhannity @kimguilfoyle @marklevinshow @rushlimbaugh
5447 2018-07-11 16:07:22 Venezuela under Chavez allied itself with Putin's Russia. It's woes have as much to do with autocracy and economic dependence on high oil prices as anything.

5451 2018-07-11 16:07:08 Also a 72 four door with a 402 BBC, 342 posi. Burned more oil than gas but it would lay rubber for a mile. Had WAY to much fun in that car. Lol
5452 2018-07-11 16:07:05 You talk as if Nigeria was the only country affected by the drop in oil price. Those other countries also rich in oil are they in same mess we in today?
5453 2018-07-11 16:07:04 Oh I see your original question now. Absolutely not. It is prescribed to me both THC and CBD. Basically my prescription is up to me to find what works best for my body. I'd much rather take CBD oil daily cause it's alot higher % and lasts longer. Smoking the CBD didn't help much
5454 2018-07-11 16:06:59 If Germany is owned by Russia then we are owned by Argentina. You don’t know where we get our oil from.
5455 2018-07-11 16:06:53 As long as it’s not burning the oil and the oil level is still good you be ight
5456 2018-07-11 16:06:47 TX Comptroller ups state revenue estimate through FY 2019 by more than $2.8 billion, says that's thanks to rising oil prices/overall economic expansion.
5457 2018-07-11 16:06:45 They rel6on Putin for oil and gas and give him that power over them. If he cuts it off for blackmail to get what he want they will call on us to protect them. We suppy more money to protect them then they do. They have hortible military. So they need us. They feel so superior.

5460 2018-07-11 16:06:26 I still think SA doesn’t have a strong solid trade criteria I mean I don’t know for sure but I think SA products  are placed under immense tariffs around the world and that’s not a good thing for our country. Even Sasol should be taking oil from Nigeria instead of Saudi Arabia
5461 2018-07-11 16:06:12 A lot of Dems are attacking Trump because he “attacked our allies at NATO”

Sorry, but “allies” don’t steal from you, take advantage of you, and get all their oil from Russia. Trump won’t bend over for our “allies” like Obama did.
5462 2018-07-11 16:06:07 WE DID IT! for the kids <3 Such an amazing charity, cant wait for my softball jersey and that nice coconut oil workout stream ;)
5463 2018-07-11 16:06:05 Why? Because he told Merkel that her country need to pay their fair share to NATO? Do you want The US to keep paying the bulk of money, while Germany is sending billions of dollars to Russia for oil?
5464 2018-07-11 16:05:59 HOW is he more loyal to Putin when he's telling Germany that while we pay into NATO to protect THEM from Russia THEY turn around & enrich Russia by putting in an oil pipeline to obtain oil from Russia b/c Germany stupidly shutdown their own resources ratger tgan phase out.
5465 2018-07-11 16:05:52 But at least tel (oil) to use Karo
5466 2018-07-11 16:05:42 I spent $140 on an oil change yesterday, but it’s ok since my next service isn’t due until July 2020

They rubbed this wand on me and said something came up. I wasn’t kidding about the maintenance closet and palms on me.. 
Like I said in the end they said it was probably my lotion/baby oil 
5472 2018-07-11 16:05:21 That IMO is US strategy, but requires oil only priced in USD.  If oil is $100 in USD & 30 in CNY, that implies either the creation of 2 oil markets, or a collapse of USD v. CNY thru the oil link.
5473 2018-07-11 16:05:19 So, a couple of things in that statement. Most of US oil exports are sulfur-rich and are not suitable for many European cars and other uses. The United States imports oil. It’s the largest supplier is Canada. So, I guess Canada now controls United States.

5505 2018-07-11 16:04:12 Or all the years we've bought oil from Saudi Arabia, acting like they're an ally, oh but wait so is Israel.
5506 2018-07-11 16:04:07 You can order the oil in a bottle online! (Try, hempworx) and then you just put the oil under your tongue and swallow  bottle has a dropper and everything, so you can add it to drinks too if you don't like the taste. I get mint flavor tho too!
5507 2018-07-11 16:04:06 He’s 100% correct. Why do u import gas or oil from Russia and strengthen Putin’ economy and in the same time complain about Russia making problems in Europe? Even though we are against some Trump’s policies, but one has to put an end to this European BS.
5508 2018-07-11 16:04:05 The Saudis are a client regime they are protected by the west as long as they keep the oil flowing and pay for arms the jihadist needs in syria from Nato countries to destabilize the region this is the saudis role they are strictly financers of terrorism

5517 2018-07-11 16:03:19 Because we pay WAY more than they do and have a much higher GDP. They don't meet their agreed upon GDP percentage. We protect them at our expense while they add to Russia's coffers from oil/gas. Where's your outrage?

Trump intends to use Germany as  HIS excuse to lift sanctions against Russia. Why? 

Trump will legitimize Russia using Germany. 

Prediction:

Trump will announce lifting sanctions against Russia, after securing midterm sabotage
5521 2018-07-11 16:02:41 False.  Trump is just pointing out the issues like 70% of Germany's oil and gas will be supplied by Russia who is against NATO.

5532 2018-07-11 16:02:02 @Lawrence United States has always told its citizens that Russia and China were its enemies. Today president Trump condemned Germany for Importing oil from Russia stating that it goes against NATO. Trump and family get goods from China and also does deals with Russia.
5533 2018-07-11 16:02:02 God you are fricken stupid.....we pay NATO 73%...we protect Germany from Russia but Germany buys it oil/gas from Russia...what part of that makes any sense..Russia has a pipeline hub in Germany
5534 2018-07-11 16:01:58 But it seems that Trump is actively working to fix that imbalance. I think I look at the same situation like you and it seems to me gold will be driven down in dollar terms while oil will be going up to big new highs to correct that situation.

5552 2018-07-11 16:00:33 Germany sold itself out for cheap oil. Only Trump has the guts to call it out.
5553 2018-07-11 16:00:31 & I explained 2 u they weren't. But u still don't want 2 accept it. Germany (and Europe) keep financing Russia through gas & oil purchases. The kicking from G8, had no effect in stopping Russia. So they failed. You want to keep failing? I think Trump strategy is different...

5560 2018-07-11 16:00:14 If this is the case then when the US buys oil from Saudi Arabia we’re supporting terrorism.
5561 2018-07-11 16:00:11 I just heard PRESIDENT TRUMP tell GERMANY you buy your gas and oil from RUSSIA then you want the UNITED STATES to PROTECT YOU they can't EXPLAIN IT
5562 2018-07-11 16:00:07 That is a bit of an apocalyptic scenario. US will not run out of gold because it has its own oil. It doesn't have to give gold to get oil. The only people losing their gold is China which needs energy. Oil being cheapest in gold terms is a fair point.
5563 2018-07-11 16:00:03 Nothing wrong with purchasing oil from or arming Saudi. Iran is encroaching in the region, most likely with Russian backing.

Germany got rid of it coal & nuclear power generation plants & now depends for most of its oil & gas on Russia.

5567 2018-07-11 15:59:34 Putin's puppet, that's a little harsh, even for you, Germany is in the process of buying oil from Russia while we foot the bill for their defense (of Russia), Trump's saying if we're providing security then reciprocate and buy your energy from the U.S. Just sayin'

5569 2018-07-11 15:59:21 This was inevitable.  When Russia was building its oil refinery with the h ed l of U.S. companies. Putin kicked those companies out just prior to completion. Didn't pay them. Oil will of course cause a war in the future.
5570 2018-07-11 15:59:06 Yeah, Putin will be super excited about cutting Russia's oil revenues.

5628 2018-07-11 15:55:16 Isn't it possible to acknowledge that he has a point (i.e., the Russia-Germany oil pipeline makes Germany dependent on Russia economically)? Does Trump saying it make it wrong? Were prior admins who opposed the pipeline also wrong?
5629 2018-07-11 15:55:14 How much oil does the US buy from Saudi Arabia?
5630 2018-07-11 15:55:07 Putin is trapped by his own gaz and oil. He must sell gaz and oil otherwise no money for Russia with a weak economy ....that makes him very weak with the GDP of Spain
5631 2018-07-11 15:55:00 And get energy in return. Just like the US pays billons to Saudi Arabia for the same - oil and gas

5633 2018-07-11 15:54:47 Everything to do with trade wars. Oil companies produce crude, products are irrelevant to their bottom line. Massive draw in crude and no movement means purely profit taking with investors cautiously watching for direction with an uncertain market.

5638 2018-07-11 15:54:27 We were discussing NATO and 2%, but then you went all Germany importing Russian oil. (40% of German crude imports, btw)
5639 2018-07-11 15:54:25 Yeah but you change the oil every 5k miles and it'll run for a long time not every 40k miles lol
5640 2018-07-11 15:54:23 Maybe it "helped." But, the Saudis usually do what they think is in their own interest. Enough added supply hurts @PutinRF_Eng. Also hurts Texas (and national) oil patches.  Massive development of the U.S. oil capacity is the single most important thing we can do strategically.
5641 2018-07-11 15:54:19 Tea tree oil then clear nail varnish over the top. Stops the buggers spreading.
5642 2018-07-11 15:54:17 NATO is based on solidarity against Russian aggression. We're paying much more that  than the Europe and  Germany is not even paying the 2% required. Yet Germany wants to sign a pact with Russia and get majority of their oil from Russia. See the problem? Trump acknowledged it.
5643 2018-07-11 15:54:14 We shouldn’t be using oil now you’re blocked!
5644 2018-07-11 15:54:13 Dummy we’ve been buying oil from Russia for decades.
5645 2018-07-11 15:54:11 If Germany is a captive of Russia because that's where they get all their oil from, doesn't that mean that Trump is a captive of Russia because that's where he got his Presidency from?
5646 2018-07-11 15:54:10 How much does the pipeline improve German economy? That it improves Russian oil access is U.S. concern, but isn't Germany concerned with Germany first? Aren't U.S. concerns U.S. concerns first?

5656 2018-07-11 15:53:24 Not only did he attack NATO he also attacked Germany for their own dealings with Russian oil. Which BTW we do too! We buy tons of shit from Russia! He is grandstanding for his idiotic base.

5670 2018-07-11 15:52:26 But Germany is giving millions if not billions to Russia for oil.  So that would mean Germany is buying the billets that would be used to attack them.
5671 2018-07-11 15:52:23 Merkel wants to play both ends to the middle- the Americans to run interference if Russia shuts down her oil and gas, meanwhile doing deals with her old Communist buddies. The President was right to call her out. Should have been done years ago with the UE.

ONLY HALF
the facts?

Feel free to ALSO
report Germany will
DEPEND on Russia
for 70% of it's energy
(Gas +Oil), and Germany
to Pay BILLIONS $$
(With a "B")
to Russia for it.

Still only "accusation"..??
5685 2018-07-11 15:51:23 I guess my view was that at $300/month, that is below the average rent price for the poorest American families unsubsidized while offering heating and cooling costs 1/10th that of a 40's oil heated home. (Much to the gain of helping Greenhouse pollution.)

5687 2018-07-11 15:51:14 if we get a drop in oil, they'll lower it back down
5688 2018-07-11 15:51:11 A lot of people knows Bruce Jenner and businessman Kardashian who died, that family was rich before Kim got friends with Hilton. The same with Hadids because their father is a oil company owner
5689 2018-07-11 15:51:08 Ask Dwight K Schrute how that plays out
5690 2018-07-11 15:51:08 I see people talking about Germany being dependent on Russia for energy, but no one is talking about why.  The green wave that had them closing nuclear power plants, coal plants, and oil fired plants in a search for green energy had a lot to do with it.
5691 2018-07-11 15:51:07 when there's oil on the ground n water hits it, a rainbow forms? Probably some pretty nasty vapors causing that pretty rainbow. Just saying

5694 2018-07-11 15:50:42 CNN is so full of hate for Trump they can't see the genius of Trump. I am guessing this.Trump will get Putin out of Crimea and Syria. NATO meeting just assured it.. Stop the money Germany gives Putin in oil revenue and allow us to sell our oil to Germany again will bankrupt Putin

5698 2018-07-11 15:50:27 That was NOT the reason for starting the war.  Seizing oil after the war started was a tertiary goal, especially as the British Navy had effectively cut off German overseas imports.  You are confusing cause and effect.

5705 2018-07-11 15:49:53 A couple problems with Europe.  They are far too dependent on Russian natural gas.  They are also far to quick to overlook Iran’s dangers in order to possess their oil.  These two problems make dealing with these countries more difficult.
5706 2018-07-11 15:49:52 Trump says Germany spends more in gas and oil than on tanks and planes. I'm with the Germans on that one.

5711 2018-07-11 15:49:09 We DO NOT import oil from Russia.  In fact, we are energy independent from SA and other countries now.  Due to more drilling under Pres Trump.  We EXPORT oil now.

5714 2018-07-11 15:49:04 So the oil u know doesn't undergo any form of chemical reaction abi ??? Google search to find out d  process of producing oil!!!
5715 2018-07-11 15:48:58 WTF does it matter where they buy their oil as long as it isn’t North Korea or states like that? Buying stuff from Russia does not in any way make them an ally of Russia. Did you read the link I sent? We also import oil from Russia! #BS

5719 2018-07-11 15:48:37 RT @JohnAllenPaulos: South Korea has a larger GDP than Russia. So does Italy. Russia has land, oil, nuclear weapons, and Vodka.
5720 2018-07-11 15:48:32 A pipeline vs buying oil from a tanker is not the same. A pipeline forces  reliance while oil from tankers can be bought from anyone so changes can be made. But, you obviously don’t understand logic and reason so I will leave you be with your thoughts and fairytales.
5721 2018-07-11 15:48:29 it's good as a spread on other sorts of sandwiches. If you thin it with olive oil it can be a sauce for noodles or whatever.
5722 2018-07-11 15:48:26 I called my pawpaw to ask about oil in my car and before I hung up, unprompted, he said “Love you.” And I don’t y’all, I’m just crying because

5726 2018-07-11 15:48:16 I think what the US wants is to sell their expensive shale gas. Oil prices will go up because of the blockade to Iran. But still exporting gas to Europe is ridiculous. Ukraine is already buying US gas.
5727 2018-07-11 15:48:14 Oil certainly makes things work
5728 2018-07-11 15:48:14 North also has oil and gas. It also has 20m population as compared to 5m in South.
5729 2018-07-11 15:48:14 Since they are totally dependent on Russian oil, I’d say he’s accurate!
5730 2018-07-11 15:48:13 Trump wants Germany to buy oil from the US
5731 2018-07-11 15:48:08 muy ! pero en los "negocios" entre poderosos y gobiernos siempre fue es y sera asi, lee acerca de la compra de Petrobras por Pampa, su posterior venta a Trafigura , los raros montos , la compra de acciones, despues querer licitar por Oil ... es tambien muy interesante

While discussing the % of their overall natural gas and oil Germany purchases from Russia, it would have be helpful if you had discussed how much of Germany's energy usage comes from renewable energy, petroleum and nuclear for clarity.

5738 2018-07-11 15:47:43 LOL. Just because you (or Trump) didn't know about it, doesn't mean the rest of the world didn't. When have we defended Germany (our bases are there for our benefit)? They are allowed to buy oil, from whoever they chose. Germany isn't asking for anything from us.
5739 2018-07-11 15:47:39 We need to find a energy source that is both efficient and is clean and safe for both us and the planet. Oil and coal are not either.
5740 2018-07-11 15:47:39 Yes and no. I spent 10 years in the patch. We are not world class but not worst class. Our “standards” were basically adopted from the Norwegian oil companies so I can’t agree with highest in world but they are at least equal. Be proud, but look ahead.

Hmmm, wonder how the #MSM would have covered it if @realDonaldTrump would have just said to Germany; "Hey, isn't building a massive new oil and gas pipeline across Europe bad for the environment?"
5755 2018-07-11 15:47:15 Trump thumps Merkel for buying oil from Russia after publicly begging middle eastern potentates of OPEC to produce more oil so he doesn’t have to answer to increased gas prices. Precious!

5765 2018-07-11 15:46:25 @jpmorgan It's your shinannigans that makes oil prises go up and down like it does.Loads of the stuff around
5766 2018-07-11 15:46:22 2). Why doesnt Germany buy oil from US?  We are exporting heavily now, due to energy independence from SA oil. We are a NATO partner and pay heavily to protect Germany who does not carry their own weight with NATO contributions.
5767 2018-07-11 15:46:21 Crude: Higher for longerJust a few years ago the mantra on crude oil prices was “lower for longer.” Irrational pessimism about the dynamic power of the U.S. economy as well as a misunderstanding about the potential and risks associated with shale oil production substantially ...

5773 2018-07-11 15:46:00 fair marketing practice. THe construction of the oil pipeline from Qatar should be complete to give you options.
5774 2018-07-11 15:45:59 You are either a bot just full of propaganda, or you are an idiot. I'm sure Trump will, if he gets rid of NATO, form an oil cartel with his new allies: Russia and the Saudis. This has no function but to spring a public accusation against our closest allies.

5778 2018-07-11 15:45:59 They've had oil and gas contracts for DECADES. This is nothing new. They need the oil and gas, and they have long standing international agreements and pipelines. This is an overblown talking point, meant to tear us apart for novus ordum.

5780 2018-07-11 15:45:56 I'd say his problem with the PKK is they're Russian-supported and have cut the oil and gas pipelines to Iran and Iraq. Turkey is now dependent on Russia for its energy. Our war with PKK and ISIS is based on reopening gas lines, IMHO, like WWI.

5789 2018-07-11 15:45:07 Yep.

Germany richest country in EU refusing to pull its weight while getting half its oil and gas from Russia.
5790 2018-07-11 15:45:01 1) Use Less Products
I wouldn’t suggest quitting styling products altogether, but keep in mind that product buildup only adds to greasy hair. Try sticking to powder-based products to soak up oil or look for products that are two-in-one, like a dry shampoo that's also a volumizer.

5800 2018-07-11 15:44:30 I heard it was 9% of their oil. That’s hardly being “controlled” by Russia. And while we’re on the subject, why do any of the countries (who Putin attacks) need to buy anything from him at all?

5814 2018-07-11 15:43:41 I have seen this noted more recently: “Every recession has been preceded by two things: an inverted yield curve and rising oil and gas,” Mr. LaVorgna said."
5815 2018-07-11 15:43:41 oil is the only thing going down faster than "oil inventories"
---> by now everybody knows "inventories" are manipulated

5816 2018-07-11 15:43:37 Really? I thought Putin was EVIL? Then y spend billions supporting him by buying his oil!? If u are a NATO ally then buy from a NATO ally! Just the truth. Trump didn’t print the conversation. It’s only public becuz they wanted it to be. Fight Putin with actions not condemnations!
5817 2018-07-11 15:43:33 Did it ever occur to you why Germany doesnt pay its alloted 2% of GDP into NATO defense fund? Only 1% pd. 
Germany buys oil from Russia(the very country NATO was designed to protect from)
Confict?   Pres Trump is correct to demand they increase % and stop buying oil from Russia.
5818 2018-07-11 15:43:26 Clove oil is really good for tooth and gum pain, it tastes pretty gross but works really well
5819 2018-07-11 15:43:25 Oil pipelines are safer than rail cars.
A lot of indigenous  feel it can benefit their people.
5820 2018-07-11 15:43:17 Oh I thought I was talking about illegal immigration. I'm not trying to get off topic here. That'll just be an oil painting of your emotions
5821 2018-07-11 15:43:08 It’s amazing how a down day in oil and seems like everyone turns bearish.  #OOTT #neverthateasy
5822 2018-07-11 15:43:06 That one man on Facebook who's wife is an oil executive and he doesn't work and cheats on her. I'm sure she was doing wife shit but he got her on the internet looking dumb. Can these men do husband shit?
5823 2018-07-11 15:42:57 If you don’t want to believe what he said that is your right. I tend to believe him. And Trump is right when he says to Germany...purchase your oil somewhere else.
5824 2018-07-11 15:42:54 
5825 2018-07-11 15:42:51 Wise. My tame Jag guys will fit mine for about £150ish, but I keep finding more important things that that cash needs to go on. Like, fixing oil leaks, MOT's, etc.
5826 2018-07-11 15:42:31 Don't describe olive oil's flavor as grassy, because humans don't eat grass. - Simon Field #oliveoilconference
5827 2018-07-11 15:42:28 The verb “adulting” is the worst. Be an adult. You are an adult. Getting my oil changed and refilling my birth control is part of my life, I’m an adult all the time, I am not “adulting” I’m living my life and I am HEATED about this petty thing okay bye
5828 2018-07-11 15:42:26 I find this briefing so hypocritical ... flattery after you just stabbed your ally in the back ... Would he have done it with a male leader?? I wish Angela had responded to his attack with: « Would you prefer that we buy oil from Mexico? Syria? Venezuela? »
5829 2018-07-11 15:42:25 And I think it is a correct and very charitable read of eg Trump to suggest that he thinks aggressive wars for resource exploitation or outright conquest are not necessarily wrong or bad. His openness to Crimean recognition and his "take their oil" comments make that clear.
5830 2018-07-11 15:42:09 It’s too hot to be doing oil changes outside.
5831 2018-07-11 15:41:54 Emphasis on "boys" ....no Man would actually think this is cleaning!!!
5832 2018-07-11 15:41:42 Eyebrows is a naturally sparse area in some cats, genetically, I think. Is the fur on his back patchy? Do you ever watch him clean, and he seems to spend too much time in one area vs others? Cocoa's patches are her legs, and of course her belly. CBD oil seems to help her anxiety.
5833 2018-07-11 15:41:36 I like that one. One of my faves is Theodore & The Oil Rig
5834 2018-07-11 15:41:33 So when we buy oil form Saudi Arabia, home of the 9/11 terrorist. We are supporting terrorism. And then we sell them fighter planes. Do you see the flaw with your attempt at logic.
5835 2018-07-11 15:41:29 Are you really this thick?
The president brought up the conflict of protecting Germany from a country that is also a huge oil supplier.
Never mind the relationship between Germany's ex-chancellor and Putin.
Yeah, our president is a real Putin puppet 
5836 2018-07-11 15:41:22 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Philadelphia sleeps.
5837 2018-07-11 15:41:21 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Los Angeles sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
5838 2018-07-11 15:41:21 It's true France+Germany decided if they buy Putin's oil & gas he'll stay at bay because he need's cash flow & NATO is nothing but a hedge strategy.

5842 2018-07-11 15:40:53 The Idiot accuses Germany of buying oil from Russia. Should Germany buy it from the States perhaps? No possible. Should then Germany don't buy it at all? And the States buy oil from the Arabs. Are the USA controlled by Arabic States? The morons wants to destroy Germany/EUperiod.

5845 2018-07-11 15:40:47 Nato is fighting in the American Interest. Shut it down. We don't need no more wars for oil or gaspipelines.
5846 2018-07-11 15:40:42 We have started reducing our dependence on oil but that was well underway long before Trump. That really happened in 2005 . We still import a lot tho. Canada, Saudi,  Venezuela

5848 2018-07-11 15:40:30 I wouldn't say purely scientific - knowledge of markets is important - but the key is to be able to identify promising "white spaces" and recruit top-notch program managers to try to fill them in.  Utility and oil and gas banking doesn't prepare someone for that.
5849 2018-07-11 15:40:27 And America is controlled by the Middle East? 70% of our oil.
5850 2018-07-11 15:40:26 I take a few pills (cinnamon,fish oil, Calcium/magnesiumI, and a multivitamin) each day. Today I took my last multivitamin. Debating but more multivitamin or switch to a greens add-in like Amazing Greens. Anyone have experience in this? Do I get more from multiple or greens?

5855 2018-07-11 15:40:06 AND Germany can buy energy from whoever they fucking want, it has nothing to do with NATO! We buy oil and steel and other shit from Russia
5856 2018-07-11 15:40:04 Tell you what, the next TV deal won't be this lucrative if they keep dropping around 1 million+ fans every five years. Between that and the Saudi oil money, it's a stack of cards waiting to tumble in the long term.

5867 2018-07-11 15:39:29 Bet, i heard grapeseed oil works well to
5868 2018-07-11 15:39:27 They need to buy natural gas from our oil companies if they really, really want to be free of Russia
5869 2018-07-11 15:39:26 like my hair is naturally dry so even with a bunch of oil it still gets dry but this leave in is from the curl salon and was the only one who helped bc it has a lot of oils and my hair gets very hydrated but I'm broke till tomorrow so we gonna have to wait

5885 2018-07-11 15:38:24 and, since you might be wondering, the US imports oil from Russia.
5886 2018-07-11 15:38:23 CBD oil helps me.
5887 2018-07-11 15:38:16 This is stupid semantics. Of the gas germany does import, and therefore needs, 75% of it comes from russia and that is going to increase. But so what? Canada is dependent on oil from US + ME. Thanks to globalist cheerleaders like you and @acoyne MNCs now control sovereign states

5890 2018-07-11 15:37:56 Oil (usually olive) that has been made holy by a specific prayer from a church higher up.....which is then used by priesthood holders who pour it over a person's head who wants a blessing.

5906 2018-07-11 15:36:56 The idea that Russia, whose economy would completely fail without its oil and natural gas exports, is controlling the countries it sells them to, would be laughable if it weren't being promoted by a Russian agent who has been elected President of the United States.

5914 2018-07-11 15:36:05 Except Trump is literally telling Germany that they need to be tougher on Russia, it’s a mistake for Germany to be relying on so much Russian oil. Pay attention!!!

5916 2018-07-11 15:36:03 There is a huge priority project for a gas pipeline from Russia to Germany that the US opposes because we want US Oil Gas Companies to supply that energy. My guess is US Oil Cos are behind this particular one.

5928 2018-07-11 15:35:24 NATO

Germany is cutting billion dollar deals with Russia, and is dependent on them for their oil. 

So Merkel, the darling of the left, who the libs love to call the “leader of the free world,” is joined at the hip with Putin. There you have it.
5929 2018-07-11 15:35:19 The (few) voters who turned out in 2015 overwhelmingly OKd #txlege proposal to send $2.5 billion/yr of sales tax revenue to the Highway Fund.  (Highways also get 3/4 of gasoline tax, plus some oil/gas severance taxes.)  School funding was also hurt by state franchise tax cuts.

5933 2018-07-11 15:35:02 Always has been. If Germany was buying oil and gas from Russia even before the wall fell, then yea it looks like a big show for us all.

5936 2018-07-11 15:34:51 Go and check again. No amount is pending. Clear your facts first. Be happy that we even bought your oil when whole world had put  Sanctions on u. Only India resisted US sanctions then. Now we won't bcze we know Iran is in hands of Mullahs.
5937 2018-07-11 15:34:44 Did you say wors oil ? So even if you don't feel like wors you gotta cook it up to make your cabbage fire ? 
5938 2018-07-11 15:34:42 Lol apply oil :p it works.
5939 2018-07-11 15:34:40 CNN's Ana Navarro tweeted: "Trump tells NATO, Germany is controlled by Russia because that’s from where Germany gets its oil.
Ok, well, by that logic....
Trump is controlled by Russia because that’s from where Trump got his presidency.

5941 2018-07-11 15:34:30 Who didn't know about the russian/ Israeli occupied Syrian oil pipelines???. Oil rights to the reserves have already been sold by Israel to genie oil. Russian oil and Syrian sovereignty is in their way
5942 2018-07-11 15:34:19 Oil to oil...una no even reach
5943 2018-07-11 15:34:10 Using the Presidents rationale that because Germany is buying Russian oil they are owned by the Russians I would like to take this opportunity to ask all of America to bow down to your Canadian Oil Overlords!! We will be kind benevolent rulers.
5944 2018-07-11 15:34:07 Is it too early to buy my son a car? He's only 7. My idea was to buy him something easy to work on and start showing him how to work on it now. Like changing tires, oil changes, brakes etc...
5945 2018-07-11 15:34:04 We have to ask under what circumstances and who from Iran has sold the gas and oil to them? In anyway its good to not selling our resorces so cheap or trade them to the other countries just for getting bombs or giving them as a bribes somehow to pitch the sanction!
5946 2018-07-11 15:34:03 70% of Germany's oil/energy comes directly from Russia. If Putin decided to cut it off Germany would collapse without outside help. That's not a good situation to be in.
5947 2018-07-11 15:34:02 All that oil money used for jewellery smh
5948 2018-07-11 15:34:01 Even a Trumpanzee can understand basic common sense things sometimes. No it doesn't make sense to buy oil and gas from Russia while we are at war. That is just admitting that the war is a big show.
5949 2018-07-11 15:34:01 By looking at all the unrest,division,hate one is hard pressed to not believe in order to keep power at any and all cost willing to even destroy America&it's people
5950 2018-07-11 15:33:56 Just think of the low gas prices and products that contain Petrochemicals would  be if the United States didn't export the oil it produces. We'd have money to buy other crap.

5967 2018-07-11 15:32:59 I listened, Trump thinks that he will sell more oil to a continent that is moving away from fossil fuels anyway, then there is the simple logistics, not very bright is he? No wonder he bankrupted all those businesses. Still, Putin is getting his roubles worth.

5988 2018-07-11 15:31:07 First of all, butter burns, so olive oil is better.  Secondly, after the onions have cooked until softened, sprinkling them with sugar, and adding some balsamic vinegar gives them so much more flavor.

The only country Putin is succeeding to control... is ours.

6033 2018-07-11 15:27:49 This is not difficult... Germany is getting 70% of their natural gas (& oil) from Russia, which not only gives Russia more $$, it makes Germany less likely to help their NATO allies in a conflict with Russia because Russia could turn off their gas supply.

6040 2018-07-11 15:27:25 Not true,they import LNG 35% from Russia,34% from Norway. Almost no oil is produced from German ground,but the switch to green power is ramping up and hitting its goal to lower greenhouse gases by 2030,and by 2050 . None of EU produces LNG...they all rely on imported products.

6061 2018-07-11 15:25:47 Russia is our trading partner for gas. They charge us the market price, which is linked to the oil price, which rises because Trump turns everything upside down.
Trump's the grain of sand in the gearbox of economy that's destroying the whole fine tuned machine we had before him!
6062 2018-07-11 15:25:46 Why did Trump authorize a pipeline that allows Canada to bring oil to the USA when they have been taking advantage of us for years.  And we increase defense spending while we subsidize Canada.  Totally unfair!

6076 2018-07-11 15:24:55 Bummer the oil didn't pan out, but the clipping is a great find!

...แต่ #OIL ลง
6080 2018-07-11 15:24:35 Another hard truth that must be spoken. How can Germany apply sanctions to Russia when they import 40% of their oil from there. Trump wants alliances in EU to help curb the Russia move west and than can not be done with that level of dependency !
6081 2018-07-11 15:24:30 もぅーエロい♪( ´θ｀)
6082 2018-07-11 15:24:29 The US also buys oil from countries we claim as adversaries, including Iran. It's a worldwide market. Total production determines price. We may impose sanctions and say we don't buy from hostile countries, but directly or indirectly we still buy.
6083 2018-07-11 15:24:29 Europe (the EU) Complains about Russia, wants the US to do something about them and yet buys 70% of their oil from Russia, which allows them to do their mischief. Trump calls them out on this and they look at each other and blink and make excuses.
6084 2018-07-11 15:24:28 Sorry Joe, but Trump is exactly right on that gas/oil Germany/Russia deal. Billions will be going into the Russian treasury hence bldg. a massive northern fleet to control the north pole gas/oil reserves. That, in return, will cost U.S. trillions into the future in many ways.
6085 2018-07-11 15:24:19 Talk if used oil i cn agree
6086 2018-07-11 15:24:16 ガシャ更新気になるけど無理ぽ
6087 2018-07-11 15:24:14 I HATE castor oil but the way I seeing my edges want to get on I even ready to drink it 
6088 2018-07-11 15:24:12 I’ve only traded oil for 4 years - if there’s anything I’ve learned - sell draws, buy builds. Or just ignore the data. But definitely don’t buy a 12mb draw and expect tons of blind gains. #WTI #OOTT
6089 2018-07-11 15:24:12 Guess Trump is controlled by Canada and Saudi Arabia since that is where the US gets most of its oil.
6090 2018-07-11 15:24:11 Spare me. Just who do we get our oil from nowadays?
6091 2018-07-11 15:24:08 Rudy Giuliani’s infamous client list includes Russia’s Alfa Bank, in addition to the two main participants in the Trump Russia dossier oil deal, seller Rosneft and buyer, the Gulf Arab Emirate of Qatar’s sovereign investment fund.
6092 2018-07-11 15:23:58 What the hell is this voodoo magic known as "woman's shampoo"?

I found this bottle of coconut oil shampoo and conditioner my mum left and I smell tasty af. Mens shampoo just makes you not smell I swear I could eat myself after this.

I don't even like coconut.
6093 2018-07-11 15:23:54 Big users of wind and solar! (Oil countries hate that)
6094 2018-07-11 15:23:51 How has Trump shown loyalty to Russia? Be enacting more sanctions & expelling diplomats or by working to lower oil prices & hurt their economy?
6095 2018-07-11 15:23:44 Oil traders shorted a - 12.6m barrel draw.. The messed up traders lmao
6096 2018-07-11 15:23:43 I need to take my car in for an oil change, but I really don't even feel like getting out of bed ..
6097 2018-07-11 15:23:40 Wait, Trump critiqued Germany for being controlled by Russia from buying oil and having a pipeline. You say Trump is controlled by Putin everyday, so if you do it, it’s ok, but if he does it, it’s insults and denigration? You literally can’t make this up.
6098 2018-07-11 15:23:39 I literally lather myself in coconut oil & tummy butter every night & I STILL find a new stretch mark everyday

6102 2018-07-11 15:23:22 And asking Saudi to increase oil production?  Who are we dependent on?  Hope I'll live to see Trump on an Orange jumpsuit charged with treason
6103 2018-07-11 15:23:14 It's efficient.
6104 2018-07-11 15:23:07 So it's okay that we buy oil from Saudi Arabia the same people who took over 3K Americans lives on 9-11 is ok?  The ignorance of you trumpers is unfuckingblevable. But a damn book, research do something to educate yourself.
6105 2018-07-11 15:22:56 Just bought RIG at $13.87. This is my 7th trade in hope it breaks out upward. As I declared before, I would buy RIG on weakness. RIG prices heavily depend oil. New tariff threat knocked down oil prices big time today.  

Still holding GE as my purchase #6.
6106 2018-07-11 15:22:54 Boys are so gross.
6107 2018-07-11 15:22:49 Why buy oil from your enemies?  Unless they aren't really enemies... then why are we in Germany protecting them?  Valid point.
6108 2018-07-11 15:22:44 I was in Saudi in 2011 I’ve been to Aramco. It’s huge but they never release how much oil they have left My father is in AK and has worked as a Hazmat tech up on the pipeline I do not think Trump is doing China’s bidding I think pissing off our allies isn’t a good strategy though
6109 2018-07-11 15:22:26 Collins is an easy flip for trump.
Murkawski wanted oil drilling rights expanded in Alaska.
And she got her wish from trump.
6110 2018-07-11 15:22:24 Actually the news of late says the US is an oil exporter now. However, there still is an alliance that the EU also needs to diveristy from Russian hydrocarbons. So your argument is weak
6111 2018-07-11 15:22:21 Coming up on hour 3 sitting in this waiting room. I have to keep reminding myself “at least this oil change is free” as the sound of Howie Mandel hosting a game show burrows itself into my brain

6113 2018-07-11 15:22:16 > NATO tries to expand influence into Ukraine
> Russia learns about this
> NATO still tries to get Ukraine to join
> Russia cuts off oil and natural gas lines
> European countries run out of oil
6114 2018-07-11 15:22:14 Farage would be great on an oil rig in the middle of nowhere. Maybe he could consider that career option?
6115 2018-07-11 15:22:13 Coconut oil fixes everything
6116 2018-07-11 15:21:58 Libya Oil back online, Iran Sanction Softening, China going to buy buy buy all Bearish
6117 2018-07-11 15:21:57 Voting Fayemi, means establishing ranches cum boko-haram. Ekiti people, don't be deceived by the presence of Tinubu, who is struggling against his political principles by direction less governance. Look at the Sum of oil money from Niger-Delta being wasted in sambisa forest.
6118 2018-07-11 15:21:48 President Bonespurs: If Germany is a captive of Russia because they use Russian oil and gas, then the US is a captive of Saudi Arabia. Your logic stinks.
6119 2018-07-11 15:21:46 Get your facts straight sweetie it's natural gas not oil the Germans are buying from Russia.
6120 2018-07-11 15:21:45 Trump is a fool attacking Germany on gas from Russia as we get a lot of our oil from Saudi Arabia?!    Um I think Scott Pruitt has some time on his hands to go sell some US gas to allies and also arrange a visit to Paris en route flying 1st class in his taxpayer tactical pants
6121 2018-07-11 15:21:37 Wait wait wait...WHO’s selling out to oil companies?
6122 2018-07-11 15:21:32 @MSNBC wait Saudi Arabia doesn’t have a direct pipeline coming to the US and they aren’t our sworn enemy like you all have said for two yrs now. You are contradicting yourself. Is ok for Germany to enrich our sworn enemy with oil profits or not????
6123 2018-07-11 15:21:31 This corruption has been an open secret for years. It has NEVER been sustainable palm oil. Avoid palm oil products as much as possible.

6125 2018-07-11 15:21:25 I wonder what Putin thinks about Trump encouraging less dependence on Russian oil and more European imports of US oil ? Don't be deceitful Axlerod.
6126 2018-07-11 15:21:23 The Pessismisn of Trump is Amazing  scolding Germany on Russian Gas well yes what we depent on Saudi Arabia and Canada for Oil  what you talking about Trump hypocrite  being though as you think there is a right way to look tough and a Incorect Way to look tough on your voters

6129 2018-07-11 15:21:09 Because if the US could produce its own oil cheaper it would still buy all it needs from OPEC? Oh wait...

6132 2018-07-11 15:20:54 Hey, Nancy, the price of gasoline is determined by two things: the supply/demand balance & taxes. If you are so concerned, why not introduce a bill to cut gasoline taxes? If not, why did you oppose @realDonaldTrump's efforts to expand the availability of US oil reserve access?
6133 2018-07-11 15:20:45 Nevada represented as an oil slick.
6134 2018-07-11 15:20:45 Smaller Government: Just ask Scott Pruitt how that's working out. It's all about oil dude. Think
6135 2018-07-11 15:20:43 This why I/we elected him. We can longer give these nations millions of dollars to protect them from Russia and they turn around and give it to Russia for oil. Bitch slap everyone of them Mr.. President and then get us out of NATO and the UN.
6136 2018-07-11 15:20:42 @DefenceMinIndia we need to be a 'true friend' to Iran for regional cooperation and continue oil supply from Iran. We need to stand up to bullys for our bright future.

6140 2018-07-11 15:20:28 Except for oil?
6141 2018-07-11 15:20:27 Fucking Trump not mentioning how dependent we are on oil, from Russia, but tears down on Angela Merkel....He tends to leave out all the important details...
6142 2018-07-11 15:20:27 @realDonaldTrump i agree that farmers of usa are much better development both physically and financially than india but here also arrogance comes in governments of past 50 years of usa to dominate crude oil purchasing from arabia
6143 2018-07-11 15:20:26 @HansNichols FYI not sure where u are getting ur #s GERMANY says Russia oil accounts for 9%( u claim 40%) and be clear- DJT KNOWS NOTHING HE IS DOING PUTIBS WORK TO DESTROY NATO
6144 2018-07-11 15:20:19 You're most likely getting sued by the sunflower oil brand that has been using that name for months..

6146 2018-07-11 15:20:12 Yum

I just bought a thai brand that comes with several seasonings, one of which is chili oil.

I have loads of hot stuff at my house, but curious to see what they included.
6147 2018-07-11 15:20:07 @SouthernYemen well that explains it all you're sitting on the oil. 
of economic and social development in the country. Oil contributes 30-40% of the nation's GDP, over 70% of total state revenues, and more than 90% of the value of the country's exports. WIKIPEDIA
6148 2018-07-11 15:20:06 SOML, add essential oil
6149 2018-07-11 15:20:05 I believe natural gas is still less expensive than oil and less polluting as well. Easier & faster to convert from oil to natural gas than to convert from oil to renewables. 100% Renewables are the long term goal everyone seeks but that takes time & money.
6150 2018-07-11 15:19:58 @amyewalter Trump has no tact.  What he should have mentioned was that Germany received 50% of their oil from Russia and they made the Nord Stream pipeline deal with Russia in May in a tactful way.  Not being held hostage by a single supplier is good advice for everybody.
6151 2018-07-11 15:19:56 Life task! For example how to change a tire, how to stick to a budget, how to prepare simple meals, how to sew a button on or repair a tear in clothes, how to change the oil in a car. Life lessons
6152 2018-07-11 15:19:53 Trump exposing hypocrisy again:
Liberals and MSM mad that Trump is calling out Germany for paying Russia BILLIONS for oil and gas.
So now the Left is OK with Russia? lol
6153 2018-07-11 15:19:46 I should’ve just gotten my oil changed in Fresno. At least then I could’ve ubered to my Dr appointment. But noooooo they said it would be about an hour and they haven’t even seen my car yet. 
6154 2018-07-11 15:19:46 @jackabryan Just so you know, based on Trumps theory that Germany’s biggest oil supplier controls them, Canada, being the US’s biggest supplier now controls the US. You can find me in my new office at the White House. It’s oval in shape. 
6155 2018-07-11 15:19:44 *fired from government
6156 2018-07-11 15:19:41 And Saudi Arabia for oil!

6158 2018-07-11 15:19:30 Trump is angry he didn’t close the deal on selling our oil to Germany.
6159 2018-07-11 15:19:26 Eyebrow makeup skills have been so bad lately and now I realize it’s cause the castor oil is working TOO well and now I have more eyebrow hair and a semblance of actual eyebrows and I DON’T KNOW HOW TO DEAL CAUSE I’VE NEVER HAD THEM WHAT DO I DO

6164 2018-07-11 15:19:07 Do you even understand what he said? Trump recommended that #Germany buy LESS oil from Russia, cutting Russia's oil revenue. Do you even write your own tweets b/c if not the intern doing is makes you look like a fool.

6170 2018-07-11 15:18:49 Trump sates Germany imports 70% of there oil from Russia.
Fact check: Germany only gets 20% of its oil from Reds.
6171 2018-07-11 15:18:49 The Russian guys sat next to me in the cafe I'm in smell like rose oil. Delicious
6172 2018-07-11 15:18:47 Because Putin WANTED Trump chastise Germany for buying Russian oil? This conspiracy theory is insane.
6173 2018-07-11 15:18:45 We are paying 4.2% to NATO to protect their countries. Germany is paying less than 1% for our protection, but are now buying their oil from Russia, who we protect them  from & it puts much more money into Russias military.  INSANE!

6175 2018-07-11 15:18:39 He isn't lecturing them on fiscal policy he is asking why Germany gives billions to Russia for oil and then accuses the US of working with the Russians.

6183 2018-07-11 15:18:16 Americas justification for invading  Iraq was to manipulate the flow of Middle East oil, despite the promises they made to free the iraqi people to build their own democracy, it was not for weapons of mass destruction that threatened world stability  #Iraq #WakeUp
6184 2018-07-11 15:18:14 It is clear that everyone does portfolio optimisation and no one sells gas at marginal costs. It is all covered in our models. Our analyses show that withholding volumes would lead to a similar situation that Saudiarabia has in oil, i.e. a lot of sources attracted by high prices.

6186 2018-07-11 15:18:06 It’s a valid line of thought...surprised the NATO didn’t question Trumps reliance on Saudi Oil which directly strengthens the Sunni States ability to export Islamic power to America’s shores...
6187 2018-07-11 15:18:02 Yes na cos his life and well being depends on it. You want him and his cronies to lose another oil well?
6188 2018-07-11 15:17:58 What the hell does millions of people watching trump talk to nato have to do with anything ? he wants Germany to buy oil from the USA but we don’t have enough to give to the world so since they need oil of course they would go to Russia but trump won’t tell you trump people that

6195 2018-07-11 15:17:14 Do you mean like when the UK went to war in Afghanistan for you. Or are referring to the fake oil war that you created in Iraq. NATO wouldn't need half the resources it uses if it weren't for the USA.
6196 2018-07-11 15:17:02 Sometimes people need to be shit on. We give these countries millions of dollars to protect them from Russia and they give it to Russia for oil. Libtard logic. lol
6197 2018-07-11 15:16:45 So BP predict we got 50 years of oil left, I wanna be hopeful & day that’s enough time to develop a suitable alternative
6198 2018-07-11 15:16:42 What the hell are you talking about. Trump put sanctions on Iran and so  we no longer get oil from a major source. To say Obama messed up gas prices is not an opinion question.   Was the gas cheaper under Obama or higher?  Facts just are NOT part of conservative narrative
6199 2018-07-11 15:16:32 ah masa si olip oil, biasa aja deh
6200 2018-07-11 15:16:23 And in the meantime we do not need to hide in France, since the government and Total open a big market to biofuels from palm oil, which causes deforestation. that's how we make the planet great again, selling weapons to Indonesia, who return the favor with palm oil ...
6201 2018-07-11 15:16:12 The Russian government is buying control of Europe, not with armies and guns, but with the sale of resources that are in short supply, oil, gas, steel, etc, in the EU making them dependent on the benevolence of Soviet Government.  In the end the Russian oligarchy will own the EU

6209 2018-07-11 15:15:45 The BBC forgot coal and oil. Coal makes up 40% of Germany's energy mix, of which 30%+ is imported from Russia. Oil is 35% of Germany's energy mix, of which 40% is imported from Russia.
6210 2018-07-11 15:15:42 Then why buy their oil and enrich Russia while asking us to protect them from Russia? #hypocrite

6213 2018-07-11 15:15:14 Climate change= GENOCIDE of Hebrew Biafra in Nigeria for stolen oil and gas for EU through jihadists.

6217 2018-07-11 15:14:54 bila buat kerja last min, xdk maknanya burn the midnight oil
6218 2018-07-11 15:14:48 Trump is working on it. I don’t think you can say with a straight face that Trump is doing China’s bidding. And I remember the Arab oil embargo of 1973. The US has more oil than KSA. What is China going to do to us that won’t harm their own economy far worse?
6219 2018-07-11 15:14:48 Why does Germany buy its oil from Russia. Why doesn't Germany buy it from us. Germany is making Russia rich and we're paying into NATO to protect Germany from Russia. What is wrong with this picture...
6220 2018-07-11 15:14:42 oil is hilarious today #OOTT

6222 2018-07-11 15:14:38 Has anybody asked asshat45 how much oil the US of A imports from wonderful country's such as Saudi Arabia who don't believe in human rights and to say nothing about the World Trade Center.  Oh ya, I forget all the time that dotard45 doesn't give a FUCK about human rights.
6223 2018-07-11 15:14:30 The new normal is: Cabinet office funded Nesta booking a bitcoin Nazi for futurefest and Paul Mason is on the bill with him. Far right Labour MP Kate Hoey calling Donald Tusk anti-democratic. The US President saying Germany gets its oil from Russia.
6224 2018-07-11 15:14:22 Es un juego de ajedrez.. el oil está en canal alcista
6225 2018-07-11 15:14:17 Trump said Germany is getting 60 to 70% of their energy from Russia. When he said “pipeline” I assumed it was oil. 

Getting 60-70% of your energy from one country is not smart. It does make you dependent on them.
6226 2018-07-11 15:14:15 Quello che vi è sfuggito delle accuse di #Trump non è il fatto che alluda ad accordi o che ipotizzi dipendenza della #Germania dalla #Russia, ha proprio detto e denunciato il fatto che ex membri del gabinetto tedesco siedono nel consiglio di RUS Oil Company, a voi le conclusioni
6227 2018-07-11 15:14:12 Lets give Germany millions of dollars for the right to protect them from Russia and then watch German give it to Russia for oil? I do not get it.

6235 2018-07-11 15:13:59 Our economy is suffering even after the oil price bounce back. Inflation high, gdp dropped, taxes doubled, dept skyrocketed, suicide rate through the roof, crime rate climbing. Trudeau’s economy

6238 2018-07-11 15:13:47 Another thing ! Since Trump gotten out of the Iran deal Russia promised the US it would get them as much oil as they needed ! You should try to watch the real news sometimes ! It wouldn’t make you and your President look so ignorant !!
6239 2018-07-11 15:13:45 I don’t follow. Why is NATO about to fall apart? And then to say it’s because of a friendly relationship with Putin. Did he forget that Trump is against the oil and gas deal Germany made with Russia?
6240 2018-07-11 15:13:40 Not the idea of the trip (1) NATO "partners" should pay up (2) EU needs to remove dependency on Russia imports (i.e. Germany - 40% Oil) (3) Putin needs to hear from Trump that he supports NATO and better watch it! That is what the trip is about. Not all the #fakenews propaganda !
6241 2018-07-11 15:13:34 E dey change with fluctuating oil prices

6243 2018-07-11 15:13:22 •replace razors regularly 

•using conditioner instead of shaving cream gives a closer and smoother shave

•use aloe vera gel, baby oil, etc after shaving to prevent irritations 

•after shaving, if you’re going out with your legs showing, remember sunscreen!
6244 2018-07-11 15:13:19 FALSE equivalence. In this well connected global market any country can get oil from where they negotiate without being their TOADY. However, when you acquire a Presidency by compromising the country you are considered a traitor AND remain a TOADY for ever! BAD comparison!
6245 2018-07-11 15:13:18 Germany may get oil from Russia but Angela Merkel is not under investigation conspiring with Russia to influence our election
6246 2018-07-11 15:13:18 I would not argue (yet) w/you as the 4-week avg on #crude #oil imports remains +5.9% vs year ago, even w/somewhat dramatic -1.624 million bpd drop in #imports last week. #WTI, #Brent weakness post-#EIA data indicates mkt support for your theory, though trade/tariff worry in play.
6247 2018-07-11 15:12:55 Only on fake news @CNN !! Germany is not captive to Russia!! Russia supply 60 % oil supply to Germany!!! Right on FAKE NEWS!!
6248 2018-07-11 15:12:55 How much is US spending to keep troops there and everywhere else in world. They still are not paying there 2% as required.  And who paid attention to the fact Germany gets most of oil from our "big" enemy Russia.
6249 2018-07-11 15:12:54 @JerryBrownGov is an oil loving, pro fracking, natural gas pimping egotist who doesn’t listen to the people. #outoftouch #pasthisprime #crankyoldman #bullettraintonowhere #412ppm
6250 2018-07-11 15:12:51 Yes, by putting sanctions on Russia, strengthening NATO and trying to curtail billions of € being spent on Russian oil and gas. Please explain this playbook. What comes next?
6251 2018-07-11 15:12:43 It's UNSAFE for UK citizens to go to Ambazonia but Amba oil/resources is safe to travel to UK. HYPOCRISY, Double standards
6252 2018-07-11 15:12:40 I mean if Russia stopped all energy supply to Europe they’d be pretty fucked (Gazprom supplies natural gas, and the EU imports like 30% of their oil from Russia)
6253 2018-07-11 15:12:33 Tak best pun okay bila muka kau cuma nak skincare mahal mahal je baru dia tunjuk positif feedback.   Cleanser + toner pun dah cost RM100+ :) Not included aloe vera, oil cleansing and eye balm. I think it cost almost RM200+ or so. But alhamdulillah my skin getting better. 
6254 2018-07-11 15:12:31 She looked totally embarrassed to be there. Trump doesn’t realize Germany doesn’t have vast oil reserves & has to import energy. Russia is next door and has it. We have dealt with repressive regimes to get resources so shut your pie hole Donnie.
6255 2018-07-11 15:12:22 You worked ... “in the industry”.
In Oil? Gas? Probably coal.

Pipelines burst. Wells run dry. Middle East wars destabilize oil prices.

Solar and wind is local. Clean. Zero Emissions.

Excess generation can be stored in batteries and released.

Solar and wind are true freedom.
6256 2018-07-11 15:12:18 Chuck, you must of missed the part where Trump told Germany that we spend a fortune protecting them, then they turnaround and buy their oil not from us, but from the very people we are protecting them from. Makes sense. You don’t make sense Chuck. You’re an obstructionist ass.
6257 2018-07-11 15:12:14 Put slices of white bread under the chicken in the pan. Helps soak up extra oil so it isn’t reabsorbed, however it won’t be crispy the next day. I’d go in a different direction.
6258 2018-07-11 15:12:12 Oil prices are going Down and this situation will Help Global Shipping Industry to recover
6259 2018-07-11 15:12:10 If your one single job is to answer the fucking phone, dont MUMBLE. For Christ sake I can't hear a single figure this bitch gave me so now I'm likely going to spend $50 I dont have on fucking oil, thanks jerkoff.
6260 2018-07-11 15:12:10 The refining process, during which crude oil is literally heated to boiling and gasoline and other products are distilled, requires about the same energy that will propel a @Tesla #Model3 about 40 miles.
6261 2018-07-11 15:11:59 Today’s dinner: sweet onion and that funky pepper from earlier sautéed in olive oil w/ sausage, egg, and Swiss cheese.
6262 2018-07-11 15:11:58 OMG are we suggesting that the oil is worthless & will only drag down a Independent Scotland 
6263 2018-07-11 15:11:58 This tea tree oil has been doing wonders to my skin
6264 2018-07-11 15:11:53 TRUMP: GERMANY TOTALLY CONTROLLED BY RUSSIA
The reason is that Germany gets some of their gas from Russia.
That makes a lot of sense, if you don’t think about it. A Trump specialty.
If you were to think about it, though. Doesn’t the US get a lot of oil from Saudi Arabia?
6265 2018-07-11 15:11:45 Bahahaha! Let Europe get gas and oil from USA! Exactly
6266 2018-07-11 15:11:36 Working with construction works I have come to the conclusion that all of the men with beards/mustaches need to give them a REALLY good cleaning also they should really consider using some oil daily!
6267 2018-07-11 15:11:30 เหงาพอตัวเลยจ้ะ 55555
6268 2018-07-11 15:11:25 Does the right even know how small Germany is ? It’s smaller than Texas !! So how many billions of oil could we possibly get from the Russians ? That right there should make you think twice about how dumb Trump is !! Germany gets less than 40% in oil from Russia you dummies !!
6269 2018-07-11 15:11:24 Right now the gas&oil from russia goes throught ukraine & poland and they both say 70%. I believe P & U or Germany because they put a gag order on their media not to report to the public about migrant beheading his own 1yr old daughter before stabbing mother to death

6274 2018-07-11 15:11:12 1.) Open up Federal land’s for exploration and extraction. 2.)Expand Offshore drilling. 3.) Do away with any and all #EPA regulations associated with oil, gas, and coal operations. 4.) Lay the ground work for the delivery and price of the product’s at a competitive price. DONE!

Me at the beach now: *bathes myself in sunscreen, sets timers on my phone to reapply every hour*
6278 2018-07-11 15:11:00 That doesn't even make sense ...
If Germany and Russia go at it ... the Russians are going to turn off the gas and oil valve faster than you can eat a plate of schnitzel. Let's remember the Russians will never forget what Deutschland did to them in World War II.
6279 2018-07-11 15:11:00 If Trump is 'Putin's puppet,' why is Trump telling other NATO leaders to not buy Russian oil and gas at NATO?
6280 2018-07-11 15:10:50 [Spot on] All Countries have socialist systems in place- moral code before profit corruption/racketeering - investing in bottom up (PPL) + USG backing NeoCon of extremists exploiting & funding regime change tactics destroyed Venezuela's economy not socialism to control Oil & Gas
6281 2018-07-11 15:10:45 We can’t pay back the 6 Trillion that China holds of our debt, and we get lots of oil from Saudi. So we’re a captive of China, or Saudi? See how that works? 
6282 2018-07-11 15:10:45 An attack targeted guards of oil wells last night in Dibis district northwest of Kirkuk resulting in two deaths and 4 injuries.
6283 2018-07-11 15:10:43 as long as Germany imports 40% of its OIL from Russia - then YES - Putin does win. How can Germany sanction Russia with that much OIL imported ? Trump is doing the right thing by calling out dependency on Russia. EU needs to stop it to manage Russia Properly.
6284 2018-07-11 15:10:43 @BrandonLewis @JamesCleverly 

Theresa May should consider running for the UKIP Leadership. She has done more for UKIP's membership in 5 days than Nigel Farage did in 20 years.

The Electorate aren't stupid. Snake oil is Snake oil, and this turd can't be polished.

6306 2018-07-11 15:09:02 "President Trump called out Germany for expecting the US to pay for their defense against Russia while they cut a massive oil and natural gas deal with Russia. The simplicity and elegance of his argument cannot be overstated. The duplicity of the German govt is outrageous."
6307 2018-07-11 15:08:56 Plus, all the problems in Venezuela are not result of any kind of socialism but the efforts of right wing oligarchs in the country sabotaging the economy as well as USA embargoes/interference because we want their oil privatized & profits going to the multinational oil companies.
6308 2018-07-11 15:08:54 I am blocking you for presenting false stats. Around 70% of germany engery consumption is foriegn oil. Which they recieve from many countries. Such info is easy to find. Don't spread your b.s. around here.
6309 2018-07-11 15:08:49 More loyal to Putin???
He is trying to get Germany to STOP paying Russia BILLIONS for gas and oil. That would HURT Russia, not help them.
Do you really think the American people are that stupid?

6332 2018-07-11 15:06:52 I remember the Reptile and when the elephant flinged him in the air, lol. Oh lizzy.........I know Jimboman has some love for him in the end. But it is the elephant who prevails. Not the lizard. Nor the recent "wolf in sheep's clothing" that we just encountered here :)
6333 2018-07-11 15:06:48 If she experienced Russian occupation you'd think she would know it's a bad idea to rely on Russia for over 70% of your oil?
6334 2018-07-11 15:06:45 try tea tree oil
6335 2018-07-11 15:06:42 Logikanya aja si... cleansing oil lgsg ditumpuk sm fw ga enak hehehehe
6336 2018-07-11 15:06:42 sniff snorf ah yes i love the smell of oil and machines
6337 2018-07-11 15:06:26 I find nothing wrong with your report. But the different "takes" in this are astounding. FWIW, my take is he is showing he's not Putin's puppet by demanding NATO countries reduce their oil dependency on Russia. Risky move, but that's Trump!
6338 2018-07-11 15:06:22 You have some nerve! Yelling at Germany! When Russia bought you ! Gave us a fake President! Would rather get oil from them then a fake President! Now, resign ! It’s Mueller Time! Tick Tick

6340 2018-07-11 15:06:13 Mr. PRESIDENT, who cares about Germany and Russia oil deal. America first, tell the oil companies to open the oil fields. That should begin gas prices down.  Remember America first.
6341 2018-07-11 15:06:13 いや、おそらく誰かが悪いわけでは無いんだと思うんです。

6343 2018-07-11 15:06:02 @JavierBlas How to we reconcile oil price movement to today's EIA report?

6348 2018-07-11 15:05:47 Should be noted this investment is part of a greater plan of the UAE and other gulf state’s to sure up control of oil and trade networks. While it very well can provide some benefit to Somaliland, there is also dangers it’s a neo-colonial project.

6352 2018-07-11 15:05:24 And Russia depend highly on EU oil trade. What's your point?
6353 2018-07-11 15:05:18 Oil companies seem to increase 1 or 2 cents every day by the time we get 10 cent cut we will still be paying over 1.20
6354 2018-07-11 15:05:11 Yeah and tea tree oil. And biotin. My hair doesn’t ever grow.
6355 2018-07-11 15:05:08 Wow! So did u just rub the oil on straight?
6356 2018-07-11 15:05:02 Don’t you just love this freaking ASS @realDonaldTrump Drumph.. says Germany is dependent on Russia by buying natural gas but hey ASS we’re depending on Saudi Arabia for oil and China for buying our bonds ... your a real idiot @krassenstein @funder
6357 2018-07-11 15:04:54 @Morning_Joe what Germany getting 70% of oil and natural gas from Russia. Omg Germany colluding with Russia our sworn enemy!!!!!!!! Report on this colossal Betrayal of a so called ally......
6358 2018-07-11 15:04:40 Crude oil @ 5017
6359 2018-07-11 15:04:39 I cook quite alot of food I even tweet gordon Ramsay but he never gets back to me . The fries were made with Maris piper . Cooled in ice water take of the starch . Olive oil in oven cooked . Than had duck fat on them then cooked again
6360 2018-07-11 15:04:33 Here's an idea for you: I stead of cheap palm oil being used in damn near everything, help soybean farmers regain that market. It will help farmers and deter the systemic destruction of rain forests.
6361 2018-07-11 15:04:25 No we didn’t.  Thinking about it.   Jason has tbe model S and showed it to my husband. But we probably wouldn’t have too many friends if we drove one in the heart of the oil and gas community.
6362 2018-07-11 15:04:25 Yes it’s been a very incredible year, much learned, I remember my days of ignorance before meeting the elephant, much appreciated @oilfractals !
6363 2018-07-11 15:04:22 Vitamin E oil is great for your skin. It keeps it looking young and plump!
6364 2018-07-11 15:04:22 My son works in the oilfields here in Texas. The oil business is expecting oil prices to continue hike expected to go as high as $250 a barrel. Great for oilfield workers, companies and stockholders, but the rest of the economy is going to fall, hard!
6365 2018-07-11 15:04:19 sooo we left paris climate accord while Germany sniffed at us and buys oil from Russia, who wasn't beholden to it?
seriously, F these ppl..
6366 2018-07-11 15:04:14 Would rather get my oil from Russia then my President! Ugh!
6367 2018-07-11 15:04:10 Oil = Middle East
6368 2018-07-11 15:04:10 Que bien que respondió $TS al downgrade falopa de Credit Suisse. Recuperando desde el mínimo post gap encima con oil a la baja. Bien a los que compraron con la noticia.
6369 2018-07-11 15:04:08 The USA doesn't import oil or gas from Russia, or?
6370 2018-07-11 15:04:01 Nigeria is a big joke! It pains me to see rogues as politicians. God shouldn't have given us oil in the first place; the beginning of our problem.
6371 2018-07-11 15:03:45 Just trying to figure out the puzzle recent meeting in Ksa and boycotting Iranian oil along with houdaida recent development  making me on high alert 
6372 2018-07-11 15:03:44 Noooo oil country will miss you
6373 2018-07-11 15:03:43 To make his own bromance with Putin look more palatable. You buy oil from him. So, he can’t be all that bad. It’s like killing two birds with one stone. He defends his love of Putin and drives a wedge in the NATO relationship; which is what Putin wants.
6374 2018-07-11 15:03:42 So your argument is that because the USA imports oil from SA that other NATO nations can skate on their NATO obligations?
6375 2018-07-11 15:03:35 @CannTrust why did you select this particular CBD oil to test for ALS?  thank you

i wonder how many "flood-geologists" are currently employed by oil companies....
6380 2018-07-11 15:03:14 BS Merkel made the decision to use Russian oil, not Trump.
6381 2018-07-11 15:03:08 add oil

6384 2018-07-11 15:02:52 ‘I had to try and track down a drug dealer - it was ridiculous’.
@Daniarmstrong88’s best friend Sammy died of breast cancer in May - she had bought cannabis oil to try and help ease her friend's symptoms.----------------------------------------------------------------------------
6385 2018-07-11 15:02:49 Isn’t that one of the perks of a government job, that you almost can’t be fired ?
6386 2018-07-11 15:02:47 How many average Americans (outside politics) knew Germany was purchasing energy from Russia?
Trump being very public exposes all.  
Before today I didn't know former German cabinet member sat on board of RUS oil company, enriching self.
6387 2018-07-11 15:02:46 Its a beautiful day to come for a drive to our service department and get that oil change done!! Free car wash included!
 No appointment necessary! 
6388 2018-07-11 15:02:43 9% of their energy 75% of their oil
6389 2018-07-11 15:02:38 They should make him keep his bullet in his shirt pocket like Barney Fife.
6390 2018-07-11 15:02:36 There is a a gap at 70.71 too and right beneath it the 50 day test.
6391 2018-07-11 15:02:31 "BP, bringing oil to US shores."
6392 2018-07-11 15:02:30 That doesn’t mean we have to cowtow to every whim of the oil industry. Sacrificing our public services to give them tax incentives even though they are already successful.
6393 2018-07-11 15:02:30 Nonsense, a true gentleman thanks the dinosaurs for literally dying to make oil to fuel the bus.
6394 2018-07-11 15:02:29 .@AmericaNewsroom Fearing Russian Aggression, then helping fund it by buying their oil/gas, (top 3 exports are all petroleum products) is being hypocritical.
6395 2018-07-11 15:02:21 America is under Canada's control. You get 44% of your oil from us, 3.3 million barrels a day. You get 85 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year from Canada, 73 million kilowatt hours of electricity from Canada. You are under our control, you are our captives. Submit!
6396 2018-07-11 15:02:19 Is it a concern to #Germany which is enriching #Russia with billions of dollars of gas/oil purchases???
6397 2018-07-11 15:02:12 Formula for success: rise early, work hard, strike oil.
6398 2018-07-11 15:02:11 I use my jobs coconut oil so much for my hair and skin from time to time 
6399 2018-07-11 15:02:07 Russia has an economy the size of California. The fall in oil price ( 20 doller oil price in 2016 after Iran entered the market) threatened the very fundamentals of Russia's economy so they were delighted at the time to enhance supply to a dynamic country like Germany
6400 2018-07-11 15:02:05 Which is worse? Europe buying oil from Russia or US allowing China to steal tech & use our companies to earn billions of dollars which is used to develop their military & expand their borders? The world is dirty, we can't run home. Economics can be better leverage than diplomacy.

6403 2018-07-11 15:01:56 Walmart got tealights for cheap. You can get herbs for cheap. You don’t need every crystal or healing stone you see. You don’t need every book or deck or cloth or oil or fixed candle. A LOT of shit you can do on your own.
6404 2018-07-11 15:01:55 POTUS carries a big stick just ask NATO How hypocritical Germany buys oil from Russia but we protect Germany from Russia
6405 2018-07-11 15:01:53 He does have a valid point though Max. Germany should not become dependent on Russian oil and should pay more for its defense.
6406 2018-07-11 15:01:50 Bearish crude oil and stocks

6408 2018-07-11 15:01:34 Exactly what I thought... She doesn't want to change or get better. She's only in it for the views, cash, sympathy, and attention. Like oil wife life said... She wants that TLC call for the REAL views and checks!

6410 2018-07-11 15:01:23 Fried pork chops and eggs for breakfast! The eggs were supposed to be an another attempt at an omelette but I used too much milk so it wasn't sticky at all... The pork chops were pretty much same as usual. I think it's pretty unlikely to mess up cooking meat with oil on the pan.
6411 2018-07-11 15:01:03 Deferred auto maintenance is getting news tires, brakes, and an oil change, all in one day.
6412 2018-07-11 15:01:02 "fired". Heh-heheh.
6413 2018-07-11 15:01:00 Trump talks about energy, not just gas. Does Germany import oil & coal?
6414 2018-07-11 15:00:55 Wait... so now Liberals are OK with Russia?
Because Germany is paying Russia BILLIONS for oil and gas... while asking the US to help defend Germany... from Russia.
In what universe does that make sense?
Trump is right to call them on it!
6415 2018-07-11 15:00:54 I'm from Mississippi and don't know Suffolk, but I could relate. I remember the MS Gulf Coast before casinos and sparkling water post oil spill clean up - gray waters and dilapidated buildings. Misery feeling places

6417 2018-07-11 15:00:52 Do you think NATO allies will ask @realDonaldTrump where US has bought its oil from over the past 6 decades? Or why we trade with China? He is such an ignorant buffoon. Hard to even waste time talking to him.
6418 2018-07-11 15:00:50 Aaaaaand he is talking about natural gas. Not oil. Actually.
6419 2018-07-11 15:00:44 悲しい事です。

6426 2018-07-11 15:00:17 Also pointed out the cozy oil arrangement between Germany and Russia.
6427 2018-07-11 15:00:14 The logic is that Russia has leverage over Germany economically because of oil, very much like S Arabia does with the US. Since the point of NATO is to protect places like Germany from Russian aggression, it seems strange that currently, Germany contributes so little to NATO 
6428 2018-07-11 15:00:10 HOPE OIL! @kian_mrclzn
6429 2018-07-11 15:00:01 The other day I recommended Black Pepper essential oil for menstrual cramps.  I've also hard it is helpful for reducing pain this those that have osteoarthritis.
6430 2018-07-11 14:59:58 ever try CBD oil?
6431 2018-07-11 14:59:56 Libya came out and saying oil ports back open today, KSA producing more by the minute, products storage weren't very bullish for this time of year

6433 2018-07-11 14:59:47 i love an essential oil
6434 2018-07-11 14:59:46 Only liberals could keep accusing Trump of being Putin's puppet after Trump publicly bashes a money-making deal Putin made.

CNBC said Russia is actually building an oil and gas terminal in Germany!
6435 2018-07-11 14:59:43 Oh wow! Is that it is mixed or what? Cos the Karnel Oil from Palms is dope
6436 2018-07-11 14:59:41 Gotta say, didn't see Anderson pushing Federer at all in this one, nevermind to fight back from two sets down and force a fifth. Helluva performance from the big man #Wimbledon

6438 2018-07-11 14:59:38 I scheduled my own oil change appointment and went by myself... what an adult
6439 2018-07-11 14:59:35 why do you care about this case so much? you are just lickspittle. we wait run out of oil and we will see your situation you american-lickspittle!
6440 2018-07-11 14:59:34 Honey and coconut oil face mask in the shower really make the difference in my day
6441 2018-07-11 14:59:28 Putin wears a size six  shoes with lifts in them and is in debt to China because of the 100 year oil leases that are no producing at capacity. Putin is in free fall  with the oligarchs over sanctions and frozen money. Trump is his life line literally.
6442 2018-07-11 14:59:17 Nope,  that's from produced waste from OIL wells.
6443 2018-07-11 14:59:15 วันก่อนบอกขขว่า อยากกินน้ำมะพร้าว มันเลยไล่ให้เอาน้ำมะพร้าวไปล้างหน้า คือแบบ กุพูดจิง ถ้ากุตาย ได้โปรดล้างหน้ากุด้วย three balancing cleansing oil
6444 2018-07-11 14:59:11 A) they don't get oil from Russia
B) they get about 9% of their energy as gas from Russia, hardly "dependent"
6445 2018-07-11 14:59:07 from the south park episode where the oil company like unleashes cthulu, right?

6449 2018-07-11 14:58:48 Totally....but also....I don't really think Russia has alot of expansionist territorial ideas....so I think NATO doesn't have near the necessity it once did...basically you need to stop Russia seizing land with oil reserves...I don't think Germany has lots of those tho.
6450 2018-07-11 14:58:36 More oil usage is another fun fact. Whoever still believes that 2035-2050 zero carbon is possible, is really streching it. And yes, I agree it should be done. But people do not seem to care.
6451 2018-07-11 14:58:35 Just a couple of days ago he was whining about OPEC oil prices. Does that mean they control him?

OH wait! The country that sent the most 9/11 terrorists was excluded from his Muslim ban!

6453 2018-07-11 14:58:32 We extract and refine nearly half of our own oil needs and import most of our oil from Canada. Actually.

6455 2018-07-11 14:58:12 yes keto too. i am getting my coconut oil in the mails on friday so maybe it will be more official then? super excited at the realization that carbs are the problem
6456 2018-07-11 14:58:11 If you don’t have authority over EU, you have authority over US. If you can’t change EU, you can change US. If they don’t open their Market to US  agriculture products, you can close US market to their agricultural products, cheeses, wine, olive oil etc...@EU_Commission
6457 2018-07-11 14:57:59 But then I'd towel you dry and then give you a nice warming oil massage
6458 2018-07-11 14:57:47 Take small sections & do the LOC ( liquid oil cream) or the LCO ( liquid cream oil) method. Try a leave in - Cantu works good on my hair and it smell so good 
6459 2018-07-11 14:57:40 Yes they’re smart to realize that Suncor’s shareholders will pull out if they do not embrace carbon pricing. All the oil majors Shell, Total, BP support some form of carbon pricing.
6460 2018-07-11 14:57:38 oh unrelated but that black castor oil is definitely helping, thanks for recommending it!
6461 2018-07-11 14:57:35 Yay done with 2/4 of my report by burning midnight oil yesterday . I made sure I saved it in my thumb drive HAHAHAHA

6464 2018-07-11 14:57:19 The CBD OIL I have left be no more when what’s left gone sorry just letting my customers no. The price for me to get it now as gone up as the demand for it is very popular but I won’t put price up of what I have left thanks to everyone who’s bought it & glad it’s helped so many.
6465 2018-07-11 14:57:18 85% of US crude oil imports come from Canada, Saudi Arabia, and Mexico- are we a hostage of them?
6466 2018-07-11 14:57:13 But who wants to harm the good man of god ? I hate it that they sell seed / oil for protection while they guard themselves with assault riffles & countless guards
6467 2018-07-11 14:57:05 @21BMJ you running at Lucas oil speedway this weekend?
6468 2018-07-11 14:57:04 He's making a stink about this because the Baltic pipeline is seriously messing with his vague plan, made with Poland's Duda, to ship our shale oil to a repository in Poland from which the whole of eastern Europe would be supplied.  He boasted on it in his speech in Poland.
6469 2018-07-11 14:57:04 Oil producers don't rent Drilling rigs, they Buy the skills to Buy themself a holes in the ground that will leverage up their balance sheets in the cash flow column. 
When $100 oil hits there will not be enough trained personnel. Rig rates will rise, and so will oil.
6470 2018-07-11 14:57:02 I remember last April/May we were at 47.xx and after the EIA report, oil filled a gap at 46.xx then climbed higher within a few mins, this reminds me of that moment, I remember Jimboman called it a sneaky gap fill 
6471 2018-07-11 14:57:01 Huge oil draw down according to EIA report!

6481 2018-07-11 14:56:36 Ok, go! How about this?

Trump bombed Putin's ally
Broke a bad deal with another Putin ally
Sold weapons to his enemy
Applied more sanctions than Obama
Expelled diplomats
Killed Russian oil

I can go on, but I'll let you go now, @americalastnite. Good luck!
6482 2018-07-11 14:56:29 The issue is less about oil, and more about gas. Instead of buying American shale gas, they are buying Russian gas. Trump being Trump, this is purely transactional. Since they do not buy American, they must be bad. Plus it undermines his least favourite allied head of state.

6484 2018-07-11 14:56:26 Putin's puppet as he lectures NATO about Germany building a pipeline to Russia and being dependent on them for gas/oil.

He it speaking common sense.
How can fear an adversary, the turn around and be dependent on them?

Your thinking is shallow.

6486 2018-07-11 14:56:24 It probably did. Looks like demand is ass. So much for "driving season....great demand!" and all that peddled lunacy. Don't know how there could be loons who will buy this. But this time I'm cheering for them to do it. I want a higher short!!! Let's DO THIS!!! :)
6487 2018-07-11 14:56:19 NATO primary goal is to defend Europe from Russia. It is inappropriate for NATO partner to buy billions in Russian oil.

6511 2018-07-11 14:54:54 Look, @robreiner thinks telling the truth about Germany is denigrating.

EU trade with Russia puts money in Putin's pocket.

EU depending on Russian oil and gas makes the EU vulnerable

These are facts.

6516 2018-07-11 14:54:44 that sounds gross and honestly fake to me... ofc 3tbs of coconut oil for several days will make you lose weight, but eating the same amount in calories of fruits/veggies will too, even more cause loads of fibers and water so yeah.
6517 2018-07-11 14:54:44 You make no sense. Trump is slamming Russia. Telling Germany to stop buying their oil from them. Now you defend Germany which indirectly defends Russia. I’m really confused. Thank you though. Every tweet by you sends another Democrat walking to the Republican side.

Trump is controlled by Russia because that’s from where Trump got his presidency.

6524 2018-07-11 14:54:19 Trump criticizes Germany for buying natural gas from one of the only sources of natural gas in Europe. he just doesn’t understand Trade. Let’s all go back to oil lamps yeah  I’m actually crying with laughter. I thought Putin was a great guy and we should all get along?

6530 2018-07-11 14:53:43 Sorry, but I am not sure what is implied here. Is the administration artificially depressing consumer fuel costs by tapping into the 'strategic' oil reserves?

Germany can buy energy fr other sources. China will still own our debt.

6545 2018-07-11 14:52:37 Or maybe Trump’s exposing Merkel’s hypocrisy for spending billions buying Russian oil while expecting America to fund NATO to protect Germany from scary Russia & not paying their fair share.

6559 2018-07-11 14:52:05 Put too much oil in the sting beans, taste disgusting, but don’t want to waste, don’t know what to do.
6560 2018-07-11 14:52:04 how can he be Putin's puppet and putting pressure on German and EU purchasing of oil from Russia? That doesn't make sense. Also, I believe 45 has proven he's NO ONE's puppet.
6561 2018-07-11 14:52:02 Venezuela has a particular problem of being dependent on oil prices which fell below what they could sustain.
6562 2018-07-11 14:51:58 How much coconut oil?
6563 2018-07-11 14:51:58 And their oil shipment mostly go to China while Saudi oil shipment mostly go to Japan.
6564 2018-07-11 14:51:54 Germany got rid of coal and oil because of their commitment to Paris climate agreement. They are moving to renewable energy. Roughly 27% of Germany's electricity is from renewables; the goal is at least 80% by 2050. Little Donny is mad they are not buying coal from US
6565 2018-07-11 14:51:48 Canada is the United States biggest supplier of oil. So we control you. Yay!!!!!!

6574 2018-07-11 14:51:10 We don't need or want anyone else's oil.
6575 2018-07-11 14:50:59 Since WW2 Germany has contributed zero against Russia.

6585 2018-07-11 14:50:13 Try telling that to Merkel who just signed oil deal with Russia. And Trump is calling Germany out on that

6595 2018-07-11 14:49:16 You can NOT have 40% of your oil come from Russia and then participate in sanctions.. That just doesn't work. In order to EU to become effective in managing Russia - they can not be in a trade control position with you. Trump knows it.. They know it.. people need to say it !

6606 2018-07-11 14:48:27 1/2 How much of US oil is produced by US companies versus foreign companies in USA? Top 4 of 5 exporters of US oil are foreign.

Why are we letting foreign co in USA export our nonrenewable-energy future so we’ll be dependent on them again for energy at much-higher prices?
6607 2018-07-11 14:48:24 Keep in mind that eventhough 17 of the 19 9/11 hijackers were from SA no President including Trump has criticized our dependence on SA oil.
6608 2018-07-11 14:48:16 Germany buys oil from Russia

6609 2018-07-11 14:48:13 WTI ticks down after spiking up on w/w oil inventories. Data showed oil stocks falling the most in circa 2 years by 12.633M barrels during the first week of July
6610 2018-07-11 14:48:04 If Germany is controlled by Russia because of oil does that mean US controlled by China because of debt?

6613 2018-07-11 14:47:58 Look, I despise DJT as much as the next non-psychopath, but 2 things shdn't get overlooked:

- the US shale oil industry wants to sell more to Europe
- the US natl sec community is well aware of past Kremlin acts of energy blackmail & appropriately concerned. 

Rational concerns.
6614 2018-07-11 14:47:48 The solution is to shift reliance from gas and oil asap all to sustainable electric and renewables. @mwt2008

6616 2018-07-11 14:47:46 Very interesting. And let's not forget the Russians will never forget what the Germans did to them in World War II. If problems brake out the Russians will shut off the gas and oil valve and so much for Deutschland once again ...

Is that why they're afraid to do something like that?
6629 2018-07-11 14:46:58 That's a Dry Commodity tank truck (Flour or Sugar) and a brake or axle bearing on trailer caught fire. FD has to cool it off so the oil doesn't flash again.

Big user of Oil and (even dirtier) Peat both domestically, commercially and for power generation
6643 2018-07-11 14:46:00 You would think, but scientists/inventors (esp those in US and Europe) have patented things like rice, neem oil, and turmeric. They take advantage of laws and patent office conventions to describe these things as compounds that haven't been characterized scientifically before.
6644 2018-07-11 14:45:59 and per Russia.. You keep throwing out conspiracy theory after conspiracy theory - but truth is that Germany gets 40% of its oil from Russia when US needs EU to apply sanctions.. How does that work ? I lend you $1M and then take back $10 dollars ? Again Trump speaks hard truths
6645 2018-07-11 14:45:57 The oil leases are already “dirty” water under the bridge(for now).  May as well use that money for something positive!!  Or you could just let trump/zinke & friends pocket it all? #team_grifter #donthecon
6646 2018-07-11 14:45:57 Apparently Trump forgets they BUY their oil from them. We buy oil from the Middle East. What’s their reputation again?

I stopped using coconut oil months ago on my face. 
I use Jergens Hydrating Coconut Oil. It’s a body cream so I’m a little confused.
6655 2018-07-11 14:45:42 Jesus! It is not chemical! It is edible just as coconut oil and almond oil... a lot of people ve been  using carrot seed and almond oil to fry
6656 2018-07-11 14:45:41 Many of you are blinded by hatred for President Trump. Look at what he really is saying: we are footing 25% of Europe's defense spending, while they charge us tariffs on our goods and they buy Russian oil & gas. That is just plain stupid. Get off the DEM plantation, seek truth!
6657 2018-07-11 14:45:37 Oil, you're drunk, go home
6658 2018-07-11 14:45:36 What exactly does America need from Europe? Check trade...America dominates global food production, has an  oil source that's more than the rest of the world's combined proven reserves, 3rd in steel production & fresh water, & dominates the tech industry that the world relies on
6659 2018-07-11 14:45:34 Are you senile... your statement is devoid of reality. Trump criticized Germany for being dependent on Russia for their energy and wants them to buy their oil from other sources. That’s totally anti Russia and protective of Germany. Your anti-Trump script needs revision

6662 2018-07-11 14:45:31 How good is she if Germany not paying fair share & supply Putin funds by buying oil from Russia. Oh & destroyed her own country with mass unvetted invasion!
6663 2018-07-11 14:45:29 Occam's razor would suggest that bashing this particular oil pipeline is in the interest of American oil and gas, who could make a lot of money supplying Germany those resources instead of Russia.
6664 2018-07-11 14:45:27 Time to bring Germany some american freedom , you already freed most countries that had un American oil reserves its time to free the pipes also .  You have officially freed 25 million civilians from life either directly or indirectly according to studies after ww2  go get them.
6665 2018-07-11 14:45:26 @BillHemmer @GovRichardson  Trump cutting Russian oil from Nato countries isn't being hard on Russia?  The Russian economy would collapse if Nato countries and countries wanting to do business with Nato countries stopped buying Russian oil.
6666 2018-07-11 14:45:21 I would love to take some baby oil and rub those Sexy legs and feet!!!!
6667 2018-07-11 14:45:18 Ok NATO. Yea right.  Big Bad NATO. Russia just turned off the spigot of oil/ gas to Germany. Game over.

6669 2018-07-11 14:45:11 Very much agree with you re oil. There’s a significant body of evidence that for the average adult the risk is less than that of alcohol.
6670 2018-07-11 14:45:06 He just blasted NATO countries for buying oil and gas from Russia but he cares more about Putin? How can you be so blind to facts simply to support your theories?
6671 2018-07-11 14:44:55 NATO  ountries in Europe should pay up or shut up. They should pay their fair share for defense. Free rides are over. They charge higher tariffs and buy oil from Russia. Very ungrateful.
6672 2018-07-11 14:44:54 Try peppermint essential oil mixed with a carrier oil (olive or whatever) and spray it on the things they want to ruin. A customer told me they spray this on their car wires to keep the squirrels from chewing them.

6677 2018-07-11 14:44:15 Think simply, people. If NATO is to defend against Russia, why is it ok for Germany to be getting 60% of their oil from Russia? What if Russia suddenly cut it off and decided to invade? Incredibly dumb on the part of Germnay.
6678 2018-07-11 14:44:12 If Germany is a captive of Russia for getting natural gas from them, who is the USA, the larger consumer on the planet, a captive of? Most of your goods come from Asia and over 50% your oil comes from Canada, Saudi Arabia and Mexico.
I guess the answer is: the rest of the world.
6679 2018-07-11 14:44:09 You do know Europe needs oil and gas, it gets cold there in the winter right? And that Russia just happens to have massive amounts of oil and gas, especially in the Arctic Ocean, right? So telling them by "staying warm is enabling Putin", is one of the dumbest things ever said.
6680 2018-07-11 14:43:57 Sure, he IS doing that, clownishly, but he's also working at the behest of the US oil & gas industry AND I suspect many geostrategists in govt & academia are worried abt Kremlin energy blackmail. It's not as if Moscow hasn't stooped to this in the past.

You say ur concerned with Trump giving away too much to Putin & he hasn't met with him yet????  @FoxNews
6683 2018-07-11 14:43:36 @IvankaTrump please talk to your father about selling our natural gas to Europe. We have an excess that is burned off daily. This creates jobs for Americans in the LNG shipping and oil & gas industry.
6684 2018-07-11 14:43:34 @AliVelshi pls explain to viewers: since 70s, it’s been illegal for US to export oil. Only in last few yrs has that been partially lifted. Natural GAS is a transport problem. Most effective way for “unlimited” supply is pipeline. Liquifying NG requires tankers-very few exist!
6685 2018-07-11 14:43:34 Will that include protecting public lands from corporate use, including oil and gas?
6686 2018-07-11 14:43:32 I see same people here laughing over and about, this incidence, but by evening will cry over SARS brutality, & police harassment by morning, very unfortunate that we citizens continue to oil the mechanism for tyranny and executive rascality! What a democracy?!

6703 2018-07-11 14:42:25 Russia's biggest goal is to weaken NATO, and to mislead idiots who don't know he's a puppet. Do you really think Trump cares about where Germany buys oil? He probably didn't even know these facts until Russia told him. US bought oil from country of 9/11 terrorists homeland.
6704 2018-07-11 14:42:22 Besides, the German/Russian animosity goes way back.  I wonder if there's another reason that he picked on Germany instead of any of the other European countries that get their oil from Russia.

6711 2018-07-11 14:41:58 Even if Tesla isn't making money now, they will definitely in the future. They bottom line is that they have a great product, and investors continue to invest because they see the potential in the technology and future of sustainable energy. Death of oil is inevitable.
6712 2018-07-11 14:41:56 What are the prices?  Ours has gone up recently, but that’s the price we pay for oil prices going up (live in oil country). It’s about $2.95

can turn off the natural gas to the  EU. Hungary included..in the winter?
6718 2018-07-11 14:41:29 Weak politicians like you letting Germany named you and Obama over was embarrassing. Explain this, genius, is Putin going to think Trump going after Germany for importing 30% of it’s gas and 35% of it’s oil loyal?

6730 2018-07-11 14:40:58 He is what happens during the Paris climate, Russia tells Germany, France and a few other, we'll join in if you buy Oil from us, and we don't need to clean our air for 20 years.  America, Obama, Hillary and Kerry sold us out for 8 long years.
6731 2018-07-11 14:40:57 FIRST:-
-CLEANSE YOUR SKIN WITH ANY CLEANSING FOAM/MILK AS IT REMOVES MAKEUP, DIRT, OIL AND IMPURITIES FROM THE SKIN.
-USE LUKEWARM WATER TO WASH YOUR SKIN.
-PAT DRY YOUR FACE GENTLY INSTEAD OF RUBBING.
6732 2018-07-11 14:40:52 ええっ？『物資貰って当たり前』？そんなぁ…それは悲しいですよ…

千羽鶴自体も、それこそ避難所の一世帯に一つ二つ程度なら良いのでしょうし、それで心なごむ方も居る事でしょう。

でも人の心って、荒み易いのです。悲しいかな…
衣食足りて礼節を知る＝足りぬと礼を欠き易いのです。

6739 2018-07-11 14:40:31 He just told NATO to stop buying oil from Russia.
How is this helping Russia.

Do you really think he loves appearing close to Kim?

You honestly can't see this is him trying to manipulate him.
The same with Putin.

Honesty with real friends.
Pretentiousness with enemies
6740 2018-07-11 14:40:28 If we use Trump's infantile logic, then we must be controlled by Canada (our #1 source of imported petroleum - 40% of all oil imports).

But we know Trump wants a trade war with Canada.

6747 2018-07-11 14:40:08 I’m afraid you are deeply ignorant. There is virtually no money coming in from oil at present. The only money that come to the state from oil is tax. But you didn’t know that.
6748 2018-07-11 14:40:02 Twitter just asked me if I was a robot. No idea how that came about....now, where's that can of oil and electric socket??? 
6749 2018-07-11 14:40:00 And that’s why you excel in crypto. Germany went from being energy independent, via nuclear, to now relying on Russian oil because they are closing all nuclear power plant. Wait, he must be doing Putin’s bidding.

6767 2018-07-11 14:38:49 Market inventories of crude oil declined by 12.6 million barrels (mmb) in the week ended July 6, about three times more than the market consensus estimate calling for a draw of 4.5 mmb. The weekly loss was the third largest in our database stretching back to 1995.

6769 2018-07-11 14:38:43 Gas, not oil. I know facts don't matter to CNN and its "journalists" who have a narrative to push regardless of what the facts or geopolitics have to say. I suggest you google #NordStream2 and actually inform yourself for a change.

6772 2018-07-11 14:38:10 Copper just getting killed.  Ugly run the past month in the commodity space x oil.
6773 2018-07-11 14:38:09 In other words, the strength of NATO is its ability to defend as a group. Most countries contribute mech less than 2% GDP to the collective defense, while the US spends 3.6% of GDP. Then Germany has its own oil/gas deal with Russia, making Russia stronger and more in control.

6775 2018-07-11 14:38:02 U.S. oil production is rising as Trump relaxes Obama era constraints. As to your other two assertions — how is Putin using him as a puppet?  Lethal aid to the Ukraine, additional sanctions, direct conflict with Russians in Syria — none of which Obama had the stomach for.
6776 2018-07-11 14:38:02 Yes for sure. Reciprocity must prevail. Denmark is now the only EU Member State delaying the finalization of NorthStream II oil/gazpipe RUS-EU. With US support.

6786 2018-07-11 14:36:48 See what happens you speak truth (i.e. Buying oil off Russia and yet sanctioning them) and not spending enough on NATO) - people get real!! Obama was all about FAKE relationships and fake smiles. Trump speaks hard truth and that deserves respect !
6787 2018-07-11 14:36:45 China seemed to think that it could throw Trump a bone and continue with the status quo. The bone was increased US oil and soybean imports. But it hasn't turned out that way.

6802 2018-07-11 14:36:05 It is insane for nato to be funding russian aggressions with buying oil from them ,, if there is ever a conflict, russian will cripple nato allies with turning off the oil .. there is no need for nato IF you are gonna fund the enemy it was created to defend against
6803 2018-07-11 14:36:03 Trump is exactly right and the fact that he is vocal about it is refreshing! If Germany and the EU want to embrace Russia and prop them up with oil and gas money we should pull out of Germany.

6887 2018-07-11 14:31:11 We should also inform people that this is why Germany is going green! Also, getting 40% of one sector--oil--from Russia is not exactly control, and now they are ameliorating that situation--the opposite of throwing gasoline on a fire the way Trump does.
6888 2018-07-11 14:31:11 That’s b/c @realDonaldTrump asked them to release more oil 
6889 2018-07-11 14:31:08 It was a completely ignorant remark. But Trump has no knowledge and nothing else to say. Where does he think Germany, in the past and medium term future, can get gas and oil? Apparently Trump, and you both, don’t know historic and present laws and logistics ab sale of oil/gas.
6890 2018-07-11 14:31:07 So if I heard President Trump correctly,Germany is colluding with Russia by giving them Billions in oil and gas revenue and to top that, the top government officials in Germany are heavily invested in the pipeline which enriches Russia sending their oil and gas to flow through it

6953 2018-07-11 14:28:14 Germany's position as a hub for natural gas trade might indeed be comparable to that of the US in terms of oil trading. However, US oil reserves could satisfy its domestic demand while EU natural gas production alone probably doesn't suffice to keep the domestic economy running.

6982 2018-07-11 14:25:50 momadvocate389@gmail.com #Trump Illegitimate president walking back his lying remarks against Germany at yesterday's meeting (Germany's spending on Russian oil is only 20% not 60%) What Trump is really after is to run NATO and force allies to buy American just like after WW2.
6983 2018-07-11 14:25:49 Happy International Essential Oil Day!  If it isn’t Seed to Seal, chuck it.

Today I am having a sip and sniff partayyyyy!

6985 2018-07-11 14:25:44 "Pay growers more to improve the quality of olive oil" - Pierluigi Tosato, CEO of @Deoleo_oliveoil #oliveoilconference
6986 2018-07-11 14:25:43 So says the man whose country's foreign policy on the Middle-East has been dominated by oil for the last 40 years.
6987 2018-07-11 14:25:34 ...they'd have simply put all the reserves of the EUR into UST's, tied their fortunes to the US forevermore & been done with it.  No, the EUR was a long term plan to gain the ability for German & EU mfrs to benefit from a currency that could be printed for oil.

6989 2018-07-11 14:25:29 Thank You POTUS for shedding light on the relationship between Germany & Russian oil & natural gas .Former German Chancellor is on the board of the Russian pipeline expansion in Germany.-now Russia has troops on the Polish border.Putin has a real good friend and it's not Trump.
6990 2018-07-11 14:25:26 Did you not listen to the statement he gave? He spoke against the billions of dollars Germany is giving Russia in oil permits and oil purchases.  But sure, Trump is looking out for Putin's investment...right.

6992 2018-07-11 14:25:20 Also, “we have oil and gas. Lots of oil and gas. Buy our oil and gas, not their oil and gas!” Is where his zero sum trade views and playing hardball with Russia overlap.
6993 2018-07-11 14:25:10 Trump obviously doesn’t see the other side of his claim. Russia has a very fragile faltering economy and oil sales to Germany which has a strong vibrant economy are essential to Putin and his cronies. This gives Germany power over Russia, not the other way around.
6994 2018-07-11 14:25:09 By telling other world leaders NOT to buy Russian oil and gas?

Seems like you are a little short on facts and high on propaganda.
6995 2018-07-11 14:25:08 @POTUS Giving it to Germany! Calling them out "Germany is controlled by Russia" Regarding the Pipelines and Oil. Good For You Mr.President You tell it like it is. #MAGA #tellingitlikeitis #America #Europemeetings

7009 2018-07-11 14:24:15 Germany needs to be called out, making oil deals with Putin, and then not putting money to their own defense as agreed to by all NATO partners.  Trump is making NATO stronger by asking everyone to step up!
7010 2018-07-11 14:24:14 They put themselves in that position - German’s got rid of Nukes and buying the oil and Gas from Russia>>>>Putin wins<<< isn’t it too simple to understand?? Or your brain already frozen from old age and Botox?? Give this job to smart people

Hypocrisy: US was dependent on Middle East oil for decades.
Large fraction of US mil budget still goes to protecting ME oil & sea-lanes.
ME countries (Saudi Arabia) are no better or worse than Russia vis-a-vis human rights.

7014 2018-07-11 14:23:58 RT @TimRunsHisMouth: Question for the left: If Trump is 'Putin's puppet,' why is he telling other world leaders to not buy Russian oil and gas at NATO?
7015 2018-07-11 14:23:55 Facts:

NATO was formed after WW2 to protect Western Europe from Russia/Soviet Union

Cold War is over. The Soviet Union has fallen.

U.S. pays 640 Billion per year to NATO.  Germany pays 700 Billion to year to Russia for gas/oil

If you can't see the disconnect, you're a LIB
7016 2018-07-11 14:23:51 Born against christians never buy spiritual books nor own a bible but they have 3 or 4 bottles of olive oil. They prefer tokens to knowledge. Their inability to digest spiritual knowledge becomes an obstacle to the vision. Begone born against christians.
7017 2018-07-11 14:23:47 Why should interest be influenced? Can we afford to waste 50% of the talent pool for primary school teachers?. Should we influence young girls to be interested in working on oil rigs? Find out what kids like and encourage their interest, whatever that may be.
7018 2018-07-11 14:23:46 Germany Expects our protection from Russia, at the same time enriching Russia by buying their oil, and not coming close to paying their 2% GDP to NATO! #CallThemOut #WhyShouldWeAlwaysPay StandUpForAmerica
7019 2018-07-11 14:23:45 And who told you this? First cuting regulations will not bring jobs back. I work at a sawmill in fact thermal oil plant that drys wood. And if we didnt have to follow environmental regulations nothing would change we make more lumber for demand thats it, thats all demand.

7022 2018-07-11 14:23:43 1. Its GAS, not oil. 2. Germany getting billions of $ of gas from Russia is a documented fact - not politicized conspiracy theories from a biased media. 3. Germany gives billions$ to Russia for gas and then asks NATO (to who we pay lions share) to protect from Russia? Hmmm
7023 2018-07-11 14:23:43 Getting closer and closer to my December 31st, 2017 for an inversion but still oil prices are too high
7024 2018-07-11 14:23:39 The gag is that, even if we somehow ditch Cruz, we're still stuck with John Cornyn and Greg Abbott and #GovPatrick and the rest of the slowly-moving-further-right, oil money and Empower Texans-"blessed" state GOP. Sure, it's a START, but still...

7028 2018-07-11 14:23:30 No he is setting up that Germany is in bed with Russia so why can't the USA!! He wants Russia sanctions lifted to get the oil contracts open again that Tillerson started and the move Russia into NATO and needs it done before Putin gets fed up and shoes PEE PEE tapes! @SRuhle
7029 2018-07-11 14:23:29 Actually he may have gotten more from the U.S. there is a serious concern in the U.S. about the state of the oil market & it's impact on the mid-term elections. As prices go up Trump's rural& industrial support base will be impacted more than the urban commuters.

7032 2018-07-11 14:23:22 You mean the same way we used to get most of our oil from nations that harbored terrorists?
7033 2018-07-11 14:23:17 Because facts? "Some of Mr Trump’s assertions, unsurprisingly, were incorrect. He  claimed that “Germany is getting 60 to 70 per cent of their energy from  Russia and a new pipeline” - in reality around 20 per cent of German  energy use is from oil and gas imports from Russia."

7035 2018-07-11 14:23:10 I used olive oil 7 years ago.
7036 2018-07-11 14:23:08 Most Americans have NO idea that the USA PAYS to DEFEND Germany from Russia while Germany cozies up to Russia and makes itself ENERGY DEPENDENT on Russia for oil and gas. Is the USA NUTS?! Get this OUTRAGE out of the closet!  It should be FRONT PAGE NEWS!
7037 2018-07-11 14:23:01 Before April --Nov17-Mar17, they were taking 20% of exported crude oil is the prob.
7038 2018-07-11 14:22:54 Why should they?,all these forays into the Middle east are not at the Behest of EU,American expansion in Middle east should be Paid for by them,its all about the OIL,did EU ask America to set up and maintain all these USA Bases in Middle East ?
7039 2018-07-11 14:22:50 HEEEEEY GOOD FOR YOU!!  wishing you all the best! Uhhh acrylic is the most forgiving bc you can layer the paint on raman but watercolor is also really fun to do! Oil is like pretty up there like maybe you try that later on bc it takes more time and money HAHAHAHA

Enjoy your day sir.
7041 2018-07-11 14:22:42 Why wouldnt Germany want to buy oil from US? Even if tiny bit more expensive?  They could save the difference in cost between increases in military spending. Or do they prefer funding and supporting such flagrant disregard for international law?
7042 2018-07-11 14:22:41 NATO sec talk nonsense when Germany is paying billions of dollars to Russia to by oil and gas but Germany is protected by US Army from Russia !!! It's utter stupidity of US still in NATO..it's high time as well US should leave NATO n spend the money wisely to the genuine US ally.
7043 2018-07-11 14:22:35 Unlike pantywaist Obama, Trump is a strong leader with America's best interests at heart. 29 members of NATO and the US is footing over 70% of the bill? While they pay Russia billions of dollars for oil & NG. Wake up.
7044 2018-07-11 14:22:33 Trump is stating that Germany is making Russia rich by purchasing oil from them however, he is trying to build hotels and making constant side deals with Russia to help them become RICHER! aid this a CONFLICT OF INTEREST IS THIS A BIT HYPOCRITICAL! YES IT IS TRUMP!
7045 2018-07-11 14:22:29 My car says change oil but the sticker says I have another 800 miles. One of you are lying to me..
7046 2018-07-11 14:22:29 Trump: “I think it’s very sad when Germany makes a massive oil and gas deal with Russia, where you’re supposed to be guarding against Russia"

@realDonaldTrump I think it's very sad when our Congress passes Russian sanctions & YOU REFUSE TO IMPLEMENT THEM.

You're #PutinsPuppet.

7051 2018-07-11 14:21:57 BY THE WAY GUYS AHA BHA MEET ROSEHIP SEED OIL IS A BIG NO
7052 2018-07-11 14:21:45 Simple answer. He wants them to buy US gas and oil. Doesn’t seem to know US pipelines aren’t infinite in distance or accessibility. It has zero to do with the crimes of Putin. It’s all about the money and power.
7053 2018-07-11 14:21:44 It’s about proximity. Russia is the largest oil producer near Germany. Gas is already really high in Europe how much higher will it be when they have to go further for fuel? It’s as if Trump knows nothing of European economies.
7054 2018-07-11 14:21:39 Before it was oil, steel, railroads, & pipelines led by titans of industry. Now it's blockchains, digital assets, & cryptocurrencies led by titans of technology. The blockchain revolution is upon us. How are you slotting yourself in this revolution? #blockchain #digitalassets
7055 2018-07-11 14:21:28 Angela Merkle may get oil and gas from Russia, but Donald Trump got his presidency from the same place. @realDonaldTrump

#1linewed
7060 2018-07-11 14:20:58 By calling out Germany saying they are owned by Russia because they use their oil. Then Canada owns the US because you use our oil, our pipelines, our water, our electricity, and our natural resources. Canada owns you....

Then,
7062 2018-07-11 14:20:46 Gay culture is mentally preparing yourself to call your boyfriend “friend” while using your straight voice at the oil change place so you’re not murdered.
7063 2018-07-11 14:20:42 I’m so tired why did i schedule an oil change for 10 am
7064 2018-07-11 14:20:40 Because he wants to destroy NATO for Putin.

If he really believed buying gas makes a country a puppet.... he wouldn't have begged OPEC last week on twitter to sell more oil to the US to lower prices.  

Or he's just stupid?  

You pick
7065 2018-07-11 14:20:29 Crimes with long lasting effects are kinda gray.

Say an oil rig is gonna explode from pressure or something, so they dump a shitton of oil in the ocean to relieve it. Would they be liable to clean it up or no?
7066 2018-07-11 14:20:27 By his reckoning, the US is also captive to ANYONE that supplies us with oil, making everyone a captive to Big Oil (and the war machine). Minimize, prioritize and regulate it's use and environmental impact. It's finite, and it'll only get worse. He's such a waste of time...
7067 2018-07-11 14:20:10 Hahahahaha okay, hosting American troops and following us with goodwill into two separate oil wars wasn't a good enough show of solidarity. Being the bulwark against Russian expansion isn't either. Pathetic. Dude doesn't even know why NATO exists or probably what it stands for
7068 2018-07-11 14:20:09 Wonderful watching a great businessman at work,  reminding Angela Merkel that Germany is captive to Russia, they get 75% of energy from Russia, yet we pay for their defense of Russia. Next year America will be the #1 oil producer in the world, Trump wants the world to buy from us
7069 2018-07-11 14:20:07 this from the man who allowed oil companies to pipe crude oil through ancient native american lands including burial grounds without a single thought to the the history of the country he presides over...From Mexico and Canada whom he has denegrated.
7070 2018-07-11 14:20:04 Looks like the US may have to start fighting their illegal oil wars on their own.

7072 2018-07-11 14:19:50 World moves on to renewables.... dude oil demand is 100 mil bpd and climbing. Turn your brain on.
7073 2018-07-11 14:19:43 Why?  Germany owes us alot of money for military protection (1.2% GDP less than the 2% agreed upon years ago (2011 and before that - Bush and Obama).  Russia now owns Germany with a 70% share of Germany's oil and gas pipeline.  Putin now has Germany as his puppet.
7074 2018-07-11 14:19:31 US gives money to Saudis - maybe that’s why they weren’t held accountable for 9/11.  US only accounts for 40% of their oil and gas. Maybe they should be a little nicer to their allies since Canada is their largest supplier
7075 2018-07-11 14:19:29 No...China is using the Bretton Woods template of US from 1946-1971, w/gold as "bancor" as Keynes proposed.  US must either allow gold to rise (weaken USD), run out of gold, or sanction/go to war v. CNY oil exporters.
7076 2018-07-11 14:19:28 “Trump’s brazen insults & denigration of one of America’s most steadfast allies, Germany, is an embarrassment.”

Calling out Germany for bolstering Russia by exporting high volumes of oil is an “embarrassment”...or is it killing your Putin narrative? Which is it Nancy?
7077 2018-07-11 14:19:20 Using that reasoning (if you can call it that) the US is controlled by Canada bc of its dependence on Canadian oil.
7078 2018-07-11 14:19:20 `It`s very sad when Germany makes a massive oil and gas deal with Russia and you´re supposed to be guarding against Russia and Germany pays billions and billions of dollars a year to Russia`. Donald Trump 11.7. Brussels

7090 2018-07-11 14:18:27 Oil/gas is the Russian economy. American fracking had soared in the late 00s bringing down the price of oil and natural gas. This nearly bankrupted Russia.

7092 2018-07-11 14:18:22 Not cheaper in EUR/CNY, in gold that is the cheapest in USD terms in 100+ yrs.  Watch Russian gold reserves. Russia taking down gold priced at 4% of foreign held USTs o/s; that was never <20% until 1989 & was 132% in 1980.  The gold link means US oil will be outside looking in
7093 2018-07-11 14:18:18 I’m not gonna spend close to 100$ on an oil change :) that’s a scam :)
7094 2018-07-11 14:18:15 Trump is 100% correct. Germany severely delinquent in their obligation to nato. Somehow they can’t seem to get the required amount paid or even start for years. Trumped wants it started now he’s right. Giving a Russia a pipeline to make them dependent on putin oil. Really?
7095 2018-07-11 14:18:13 `It`s very sad when Germany make a massive oil and gas deal with Russia and you´re supposed to be guarding against Russia and Germany pays billions and billions of dollars a year to Russia`. Donald Trump 11.7. Brussels
7096 2018-07-11 14:18:09 @MoElleithee You got exposed today on Fox. Trump is challenging Putin's oil deal with Germany and you continue to accuse him of being soft on Putin. You have no credibility when you choose your narratives over the hard facts.

7098 2018-07-11 14:17:57 It's not an excuse that is a monopoly of Trump's Administration. It's a reality of every administration since the moratorium and the explosion of shale oil. My point is devoid of ideology or political slant; it's reality pitted in Econ 101 of Supply and Demand.

7102 2018-07-11 14:17:32 Putin told him....if Germany wants to buy our oil and gas, why do they need NATO to defend against their energy supplier...not fair!
7103 2018-07-11 14:17:31 Ultimately my point is China is following the US petrodollar template from the 70s in an attempt to dilute the US position, but that is not going to work because the US is now playing at a new higher level because it is a substantial oil producer itself.
7104 2018-07-11 14:17:27 Lol wki isn’t what I would call reliable Norway has vast oil reserves and a sovereign wealth fund which makes returns through err capitalist projects round the world
7105 2018-07-11 14:17:24 Wait, the alleged Rosneft deal from the dossier has something to say about massive oil deals leading to Putin controlling people. @TheRickWilson @20committee
7106 2018-07-11 14:17:22 He's talking ##it ..lol
The EU is asking America to pay for its defence their GDP is $20 trillion.
@realDonaldTrump is right..
Putin finances his army with money from oil and gas sales.. EU & German money.. All Trump is asking is ..why? We need big changes.

7107 2018-07-11 14:17:22 POTUS is correct! Russia’s oil is like a form of blackmail.
7108 2018-07-11 14:17:17 if the world thinks there's a migrant problem now.
wait.. about 20y parts of the middle east will become uninhabitable, huge swaths of it in 50y.

but more coal, more oil, not like hydrogen burns and there's oceans full of it or nothing.
7109 2018-07-11 14:17:10 That is very good to know! The oil part makes sense as it would help it slide off the hair follicles.

7114 2018-07-11 14:16:23 Let's try it this way, if another country comes and tells the US where they can and can't buy oil from what is Trump's response likely to be?
7115 2018-07-11 14:16:19 Clearly you guys put out Regime talking points and the people are not going to put up with it any longer. Is Azadeh trying to protect her family wealth in the oil biz in Iran?
7116 2018-07-11 14:16:17 Petrodollars used to be backed by Saudi oil, but now it is also backed by its own oil exports which doubles the strength of the US position. Now if Russia/Iran want to sell for oil for cheaper in EUR/CNY and screw themselves, more power to them ;-)
7117 2018-07-11 14:16:07 @POTUS TRUMP HAS EFFECTIVELY CALLED THE EUROPEANS ON THE CARPET FOR THEIR DOUBLE DEALING >> They have us pay for their defense and then get an oil deal with Russia who we must defend them from. No! No! No!. This sets the case for Europeans giving in to tariff demands by our pres.
7118 2018-07-11 14:16:06 Still stuck in corporate America where they would be considered inappropriate. Still burning that midnight oil to make the exit.

7120 2018-07-11 14:16:01 Sure, Trump is Putin's puppet!!

7144 2018-07-11 14:13:57 But the questions still about the role of oil revenue in financing the terrorists groups and the militias in Tripoli or you are just care about getting oil while the Libyans starving cause of such corruption

7151 2018-07-11 14:13:26 This is banal nonsense. Why wouldn't publicly owned oil function elsewhere exactly? Regardless of how we personally feel, some things are unfortunately run better by democratic systems.

Play fairly? Really? Few capitalist institutions are really accountable. What do you mean?
7152 2018-07-11 14:13:25 Germany imports 30% of it’s natural gas and 35% of it’s oil from Russia. They are also trying to get a work around of sanctions to continue doing business in Iran. This is well documented by non fake news foreign media. Why does are media suck so bad fatty?
7153 2018-07-11 14:13:23 Yes @CNBC @smeredith19

7154 2018-07-11 14:13:21 Isn't it crazy, that this massive contradiction (where Europe pays billions of dollars to Russia for their oil & gas...but then pretend to be "afraid" of Russia) was allowed to persist all of these decades?!

7158 2018-07-11 14:12:50 Thank God for President Trump. Very honest man he just told Germany the truth to their face. The want us to protect them from Russia while they are given all their money to Russia by their oil and gas imports.
7159 2018-07-11 14:12:45 Trump tells NATO, Germany is controlled by Russia because that’s from where Germany gets its oil.
Ok, well, by that logic....

7161 2018-07-11 14:12:37 The whole World knows Germany is dependant on imported oil and gas. Russia is their life line.
7162 2018-07-11 14:12:33 Yeah, we tried telling you all this back before Nov 2016, but there was a certain rabidity to people whose party begins with "R" who should, quite frankly, have known better.  I'll take a politician I disagree with on some things over a snake oil salesman every day of the week.
7163 2018-07-11 14:12:30 Oh Please...Germany is not paying the money they owe us for protecting them against Russia..Not only that but they're taking Russia's oil..So why should we pay to keep them safe from a country they're doing trade with? Come on you crazy old loon..Answer the question..
7164 2018-07-11 14:12:26 I think we should further explore this notion that a nation is controlled by the country they import oil from. Saudi Arabia, for example...
7165 2018-07-11 14:12:25 On this model, the USA is subservient to Canada. Why?
45% of US oil comes from Canada. 
And a high % of US electricity also.

7168 2018-07-11 14:12:06 Yeah 
7169 2018-07-11 14:12:01 Are the Russians happy with the current oil price? They are not falling apart but lots of disgruntled people. Ironically, if there is rapprochment with the west, social issues will come to the fore. And very little point in bringing prices down.
7170 2018-07-11 14:12:00 I loved it when he told them you want protection from Russia,  but you are buying Russian oil. Trump is correct

7178 2018-07-11 14:11:18 Yes Sen Schumer . . How dare Pres Trump ask prosperous Germany to pay 2% for NATO &  buy Russian oil while at the same time chiding Russia?

Trump should let other countries shaft on NATO & apply tariffs. 

Looks like the democrats have no business sense & no  regard for the US.
7179 2018-07-11 14:11:11 Really, how "dovish" can the BoC's trade rhetoric be when they see it basically fully offset by the rise in oil prices?
7180 2018-07-11 14:11:09 I’m wondering why Syria is so important to all these nations? Is it Iran nukes? No, the gulf states worry about OIL. But don’t have the power so they asked Russia for help in pushing Iran out. Trump always about getting rich, needed to win for scheme to work
7181 2018-07-11 14:11:07 He's an idiot. Oil production from fracking isn't profitable when the market is flooded. As you suggested, we know this because we produced ourselves into a market glut then OPEC kept spigot wide open.
7182 2018-07-11 14:11:03 Like I said, we also have oil, natural gas etc. I have no idea what its value is, but since we are making $ selling weed we aren't spending $ & destroying lives on cops arresting people who smoke it.

7188 2018-07-11 14:10:44 If this is the case why is it that the USA buys oil from Saudi Arabia?
The hijackers in the September 11 attacks were 19 men affiliated with al-Qaeda. Fifteen of the 19 were citizens of Saudi Arabia, and the others were from the United Arab Emirates (2), Egypt, and Lebanon.

7205 2018-07-11 14:10:14 So, you think it's okay that Germany is getting 50% of their oil from Russia and adding to that country's wealth while the US pays much more into NATO then Germany is? Talk about collusion with Russia! Is Germany exempt from that in your feeble mind?

7209 2018-07-11 14:09:59 Pres. Trump is pointing out a glaring hypocrisy. They scream, "Russia, Russia, Russia! US give us money!" Then they turn around and snuggle up to Russia for oil. Its all crap.
7210 2018-07-11 14:09:57 We have higher oil prices because we have not allowed oil companies, with rare exceptions in North Dakota, to refine oil into gas here in the United States. If we lifted the Carter Administration moratorium and allowed for greater refining of oil in the US then $ will lower

Not close to 70%, might be referring to total energy reliance (oops) but with exports from Russia to Germany rising, 30%-40% reliance on our greatest geopolitical foe is worth talking about

7219 2018-07-11 14:09:29 Insert your favorite dipstick/check her oil joke here.
7220 2018-07-11 14:09:27 Oil change & laundry 
7221 2018-07-11 14:09:27 Norway is a tiny country flush with oil. You know who has a bigger GNI per capita?  Kuwait. This is apples and oranges.
7222 2018-07-11 14:09:25 And don’t think Putin won’t shut off the spigot on the oil pipeline to Germany if it suits his purpose. Then who will Germany turn to??
7223 2018-07-11 14:09:20 @realDonaldTrump is right. Diplo-speak hasn't worked in 50 years. Time 4 action. Prez offered #EU  zero reciprocal tariffs but they'd rather buy Russian oil & criticize Trump 4 telling truth. EU's has vast social welfare system & we pay 4 their defense. Put up or shut up.
7224 2018-07-11 14:09:15 Plus even if you had a interconnected  grid it's still pretty useless if you don't have anything to distribute Russia is a source of gas and oil to distribute

7226 2018-07-11 14:08:54 On this model, the USA is subservient to Canada. Why?
45% of US oil comes from Canada. 
And a high % of US electricity also.
7227 2018-07-11 14:08:53 time for new breaks, tires and an oil change 
7228 2018-07-11 14:08:52 I heard this about a month ago. Great news to not just be independent with oil, but dominant.
7229 2018-07-11 14:08:47 Ingin meningkatkan imun tubuh tapi males kebanyakan nenggak vitamin. Essential oil yg mahal2 itu ngaruh ngga si?
Penasaruuuun tapi lagi bokek 
7230 2018-07-11 14:08:47 Need a oil change bad fuck around be no oil in there smh
7231 2018-07-11 14:08:46 GM Patty and the rest of the crew.  Hope all is well.  Probably gonna be taking car in for oil change, plus need to pick up more meds from pharmacy.  Outside of that, no idea.
7232 2018-07-11 14:08:42 I guess Germany buying oil from Russia might be making Russia richer like the US selling bonds to. China makes them richer. Both kind of a necessary evil.
7233 2018-07-11 14:08:39 Ah, now imagine  fire on an oil rig....oil spewing into the sea costing $$$$ and affecting thousands also polluting the environment. Complex to solve, but how soon would the CEO sort it? Now, PA! Millions of children's lives. Billions of $£. Bigger issue. CEO quoting ten years!!!
7234 2018-07-11 14:08:34 True. Migration was common to man long before invasion. Man was looking for lands to cultivate not to conquer. And there was this God person giving his chosen people a land flowing with milk & honey & no bl**dy oil. Boy, can that guy be cruel on occasion.
7235 2018-07-11 14:08:19 Who should they buy oil from? Can't be US.
7236 2018-07-11 14:08:11 @hrw @UNHumanRights @amnesty please help these poor desperate people living under tyranny for decades..... if Kashmir had oil, picture would have been much different.

7238 2018-07-11 14:08:04 If you think this is about Nat Gas and oil, you would be greatly confused.
7239 2018-07-11 14:08:02 At all levels. It's infuriating how much snake oil is being sold
7240 2018-07-11 14:07:58 turns out if you ride trails you gotta clean and oil and tune up your bike regularly. I’ve done that....... twice?
7241 2018-07-11 14:07:57 Trump is working for Russia because he's recklessly destroying our NATO alliances that have protected our country since WW2 and destabilizing global oil prices raising the price of gas and putting money in Putie's pocket. Is Trump smart enough to know what he's doing? Who knows.
7242 2018-07-11 14:07:55 An increase in excise on petrol prices of 211.7% & 433.06% (more than double of petrol) on diesel prices since the BJP came to power in May 2014 ?

Now International oil prices contracted by 67% but in India these rates went up by 110%  ?

7245 2018-07-11 14:07:44 If Germany is controlled by Russia because G buys oil from the, cancelling sanctions against R means you are controlled by Puti. And we all know why that is happening.
7246 2018-07-11 14:07:37 I'm selling snake oil if you are interested
7247 2018-07-11 14:07:35 So just because Trump is owned by Big Oil means he can’t also be owned by Putin?  Trump campaigned on supporting the extraction industries. So what?
7248 2018-07-11 14:07:35 You don't think we should install the sanctions?
Here's what I think.
This is a maneuver to set up a defense of Nord Stream 2, which leads to.. Well then, US can buy Russia oil, too!
It's why 7 gop Senators went to Russia.
7249 2018-07-11 14:07:29 @NBCNews God would not even like the trade wars even if they work for us which they dont always do im sure God is a globalist and those hand bags are a good example of Trump also  God and Trump are like oil and water thats what you run on
7250 2018-07-11 14:07:27 Well Mexico, Canada and Venezuela supply 50% of USA oil soooooo....
7251 2018-07-11 14:07:26 Trump is literally on twitter begging OPEC to sell more oil to the USA....
7252 2018-07-11 14:07:23 You might want to request the car fax on that one to see when the oil was changed last...  #FixerUpper
7253 2018-07-11 14:07:23 You've got to love how our president is quite the salesman at the NATO meeting today like hey Germany you could have bought oil off of our pipelines but you chose Russia's, bad choice we're going to f*** you up now, you may want to reconsider that choice LOL
7254 2018-07-11 14:07:22 HAHAHA nagka'castor oil nako skl

7256 2018-07-11 14:07:14 Why does America have to protect and mostly fund 700 million people from 140 million RuSSians??? They should be paying us!!! #Merkel is a NATO traitor, since she is paying Putin a fortune for oil and gas!!!
7257 2018-07-11 14:07:08 I take CBD oil to calm the anxiety. Eat light/veggies all day. Repeat my affirmations and smoke a joint underneath the sun.

7259 2018-07-11 14:07:01 Let’s hope he keeps up with his oil treatments cuz that thin shit will not be cute 
7260 2018-07-11 14:07:01 LOL.  We used about 600 million barrels of oil in January, so that's about 2% of our oil consumption.  Almost half of Germany's total energy consumption is Russian gas.  Not even remotely comparable.
7261 2018-07-11 14:06:56 Lmaoo... I tell you
7262 2018-07-11 14:06:51 There are a lot of renewables in the mix, backed by coal base load generation. (Germany makes a lot of coal natively, but little oil or gas, which is why Prussia and the German Empire were so formidable in the 19th century and why Germany was so defeatable in the 20th.)
7263 2018-07-11 14:06:47 Are you nuts? Domestic production of oil and gas way up under Obama.
7264 2018-07-11 14:06:36 What’s wrong with the Russians. Get in there mother merkel. You get all that nice Russian gas and oil.
7265 2018-07-11 14:06:28 Accuses Trump of supporting Putin for calling out Germany wanting a direct pipeline from Russia to Germany from a Kremlin backed oil company

The logic is astounding
7266 2018-07-11 14:06:25 I use those products too! They are fantastic. I love the almond oil wood cleaner!
7267 2018-07-11 14:06:24 Now all can see that Climate change=GENOCIDE of Hebrew Biafra and Southern Cameroon to steal OIL and Gas for EU.WE now unstand why there is no comments by World Leaders, Mass media or UN. When TRUMP speaks on this, Globalist will go crazy!
7268 2018-07-11 14:06:17 My boss is paying to get my oil changed. Today. I feel blessed.
7269 2018-07-11 14:06:12 Trump is rebuilding our military, increasing our oil production, and wants NATO allies to finally commit to funding the alliance.

Merkel is buying up oil from Russia and won't commit to funding NATO.

But Trump's a Putin stooge?

#WednesdayWisdom
7270 2018-07-11 14:06:12 Negative Nancy tell Angela to pay up ! No more free rides. They want the US to protect them from Russia while they prop up Russia by buying oil from them ????
7271 2018-07-11 14:06:04 @MSNBC Disgusting hypocritical liberal pundits report that Trump was working with Russia and condemn him yet you praise Germany for buying oil from Russia while sitting on NATO?!? Ignorant corrupt lawless lying liberals!!! Russia is Russia! Report the facts LIARS! #FAKENEWS
7272 2018-07-11 14:05:52 He’s not saying don’t buy Russian oil. He’s not really saying much of anything other than attacking Germany.
7273 2018-07-11 14:05:47 And where do we get our oil?
7274 2018-07-11 14:05:34 Something doesn’t ring true about this. Not sure what it is, but I do believe the truth on Seth Rich will come out this month. THIS is not IT however. Feels like a Deep State Psyop created to confuse us. Time will tell. Oil & water always separate.
7275 2018-07-11 14:05:25 Bitter? Hardly. I’m about as happy a person as you’ll ever meet. I just don’t like seeing people taken advantage of by charlatans and snake oil salesmen.

7279 2018-07-11 14:05:14 What about America getting oil from Saudi Arabia  the country that manned and funded the 9/11 attack? Trump's statement is evil propaganda. Putin is getting a big return on his investment.
7280 2018-07-11 14:05:09 What does that have to do with paying what you promised? Paying your fair share instead of expecting US tax payers to foot the bill? And let’s not forget why NATO exists? To protect Europe from Russia. So why are they strengthening Russia by agreeing to purchase Russian oil/gas?
7281 2018-07-11 14:05:08 So Zinke has handed over the Charles Russel Refuge to cattle ranchers and Arctic Wildlife Refuge to the oil cos.

What does that say about the U.S. and the Middle East?
7297 2018-07-11 14:04:13 So @realDonaldTrump - does that mean we are controlled by Saudi Arabia since that’s where we get most of our oil?

7306 2018-07-11 14:03:49 @realDonaldTrump talking to head of NATO across table as though Merkel isn’t there is delish! He has her number and playing it hard. He’s talking too much logic for the My Cake and Yours Too crowd. Germany bonded to Russia by oil is dangerous short term game.

7323 2018-07-11 14:02:27 The USA as a country Imports 60% of its oil. Of the three top countries we import from Canada is number one and Mexico number 2. If Trump keeps up his bullshit with Mexico and Canada these markers could well be cut off.

7326 2018-07-11 14:02:17 This is great because in war this is the #1 resource required.   Now we're self-reliant in war.   Everyone else will have to purchase oil from the Saudi's & Russians. These 2 will drive the price up during a war, which will it make it more expensive for them to fight us.
7327 2018-07-11 14:02:17 @realDonaldTrump Do you have to keep lying  while you are representing the USA on the world stage? Shame on you for lying about Germany’s dependence on Russian oil. Your presidency is dependent on lies and Putin’s interference! #LiarInChief #ImpeachNow

7332 2018-07-11 14:02:05 Russia already diverted much of the oil to Eu to somewhere else

7339 2018-07-11 14:01:27 Trump is playing chess. 

He complains about #Germany getting oil from #Russia while simultaneously complaining that we are larger funders of #NATO than they are.

The unspoken reality: America gets little out of the NATO #ColdWar alliance except antagonism from Russia.
7340 2018-07-11 14:01:14 Germany used to get 60% of their energy from nuclear, but they dismantled it all and now get 50-60% of energy from oil and gas from Russia!  Nuclear has ZERO carbon emissions.  Now they are dependant on carbon sources from the evil Russia.  How does this make sense?
7341 2018-07-11 14:01:14 I'm just using gold as an example. Our money is backed by oil. If not it would be worthless paper. It's not something just created and printed.
7342 2018-07-11 14:01:12 Um its gas not oil and Germany has been freeloading for too long and helping Russia hurt the Ukraine.
7343 2018-07-11 14:01:12 Also the U.S. imports oil from Canada, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Venezuela and Nigeria. Doh! AND it’s all about renewable energy but you wouldn’t understand.. go be trolled by Tyler

7345 2018-07-11 14:00:59 Fellow Canadians, have you heard the news? Apparently we own America now because we supply them with most of their oil and we're now building a pipeline to them! According to Trump that's all it takes to own a country! I wonder when the payments start? #cdnpoli #Trump #MAGA
7346 2018-07-11 14:00:51 Um... So they buy foreign oil? That's the same problem they had in WW2.
Read a book.
We pay OPEC TRILLIONS for our oil and are 70, 80, 90%?! Dependent on foreign oil.
Wanna explain the difference?

7348 2018-07-11 14:00:48 Yes! I can't find oil where I live so it's conditioner for now - it helps a lot with mine because while my hair is wavy, my beard is curly and conditioner keeps it from getting wiry.
7349 2018-07-11 14:00:44 Sooo, is it actually this much? Or are the oil companies lying to the public again, because the truth is far more horrifying? Like the last spill in BC.
7350 2018-07-11 14:00:44 Yes until Trump decided to pull back regulations and allowed the US to produce more oil now they don’t have the upper edge #TrumpLogic
7351 2018-07-11 14:00:39 @realDonaldTrump @GOP @TheDemocrats
@ananavarro

Trump tells NATO, Germany is controlled by Russia because that’s from where Germany gets its oil.
Ok, well, by that logic....
Trump is controlled by Russia because that’s from where Trump got his presidency.
7352 2018-07-11 14:00:39 Oh and oil and gas don't? Thought you liberals are climate change anti-fossil fuel people. HYPOCRITE!

7358 2018-07-11 14:00:28 Skincare Tip:
Is your skin shiny yet you don’t produce much oil? Over-use of acid exfoliators and retinol removes the layers of skin that give it texture causing a shiny, waxy look. Go easy.
7359 2018-07-11 14:00:27 Also one big source of good fat is coconut oil.
7360 2018-07-11 14:00:27 I did a week with H&S’s and some generic beard oil, a week with normal shampoo and beard oil, then both again without beard oil. Seems the beard oil is the only factor for me personally. Others may have a different experience.
7361 2018-07-11 14:00:26 Must be disclosed that Schröeder is now chair of Russian oil company Roseneft and has been PUSHING for Germany to be more dependent on Russia for its energy. Trump's ridiculous talking points are freaking aspirational propaganda directly from Russia.

7364 2018-07-11 13:59:58 America accuses Germany as a "captive" of Russia due to Germany's dependence on Russia's oil and gas. 

German Chancellor Angela Merkel disagrees.

And all this comes before a meeting later today.
7365 2018-07-11 13:59:49 Most of EU have acquired their oil and gas supply from Russia a long time ago when it was still G8. What is this old fool blabbering about captive when he's personally doing business with Russia at an unimaginable scale ?
7366 2018-07-11 13:59:43 In joint statement, @NancyPelosi and @SenSchumer denounce Pres Trump for his "brazen insults and denigration" today of Germany. They call it "an embarrassment." In Brussels today, @POTUS called it "very sad" that Germany made a "massive oil and gas deal with Russia."

7368 2018-07-11 13:59:37 Great video. As Trump educates the NATO gang about Russia ‘s oil Pipeline  to Germany, you can see the smug globalists start to squirm in their upholstered seats. Trump is a breathe of clean fresh common sense in a land of lost toys aka Europe. Only Trump has the guts & stamina !

7371 2018-07-11 13:59:28 There are good fats and bad fats. It’s vegetable oils and bad fats that give coronary diseases. Olive oil, cheese, nuts, eggs, ghee are good fat sources. Since they are dense one doesn’t really have a lot of them to derive the percent of calories one need for the day.

7374 2018-07-11 13:59:20 Major European countries (Germany practically controls the EU) becoming highly dependent on Russia wouldn't help, either. That would be disasterous. Look at how much we excused Middle Eastern flagrancy because we were dependent on oil.
7375 2018-07-11 13:59:12 Germany gets the majority of natural gas and fuel oil from the Russian Federation. So, umm, no. Russia owns Germany. Lock, stock and weiner schnitzel

7378 2018-07-11 13:59:05 The total ignorance of @realDonaldTrump on full display this am. He doesn't know what NATO is or does. He attacks Merkle over oil and gas deal with Russia that began in 2000.
7379 2018-07-11 13:58:55 Except, that is true. Trump is controlled by Russia.
Are we controlled by Saudia Arabia because we get oil from them? That is a better example

7384 2018-07-11 13:58:43 Maybe they needed oil.
7385 2018-07-11 13:58:35 If we were to watch this confrontation between Germany & PresTrump on the Fake News they would spin this "BIGLEY !  The DEEP STATE wouldn't think there should be an issue with this NATO member receiving 50 % of their oil & gas from Russia & us protecting them  from Russia ?

7389 2018-07-11 13:58:31 Trump's claim about oil & gas Germany imports from Russia is like everything else that comes out of his mouth:  a lie that T creates to justify his opinions which have no reasonable basis.
7390 2018-07-11 13:58:31 I'm no expert, but don't we have a history of buying oil from Iran? Are we totally controlled by them?
7391 2018-07-11 13:58:24 I wonder if CBD oil is or will be legal in Texas. I'm for anything that helps pain without turning me into a zombie.

7393 2018-07-11 13:58:13 Depends.  The energy poor have both set up currencies that are pro-gold to make them attractive to oil exporters, more attractive than USD on the merits.  If Russia/Iran will sell oil in EUR/CNY, USD is odd man out.  This is at crux of geopolitics since shortly after EUR launch.
7394 2018-07-11 13:58:11 Sooooooo if 710 is National oil day or what not, is 711 like national munchies day??
7395 2018-07-11 13:58:10 If the Saudis increase oil production, and the only reason anyone knows about it is that they saw Trump demand it after the fact, did he cause it to happen?
7396 2018-07-11 13:58:09 Still no collusion, and still no discussion of hillary's russian involvement. Con man talk of snake oil
7397 2018-07-11 13:58:07 It is a Damn shame that this dumb Trump who is causing me & rest of America to pay at least 25% more for Everything including Pet Food is Lecturing against Germany's & others stupidity for paying Millions for Russia's Oil and Pipeline. Stupid they are closest to them that's why.
7398 2018-07-11 13:58:07 High up on my backside - just over from where a back pocket would be. Compared it to back of arm readings from both sides and it's about the same accuracy wise. I also use IV Prep which helps immensely. Baby oil to remove. Good luck!

7400 2018-07-11 13:58:00 That oil and gas pipeline President Trump is so angry about today was built by Black Sea Oil & Gas, controlled by private equity firm the Carlyle Group. (i.e. those unpatriotic Texans the Bush family.)

7404 2018-07-11 13:57:30 Again, you’re making no sense. Russia is an oil exporter. There biggest customer is Europe. China is a giant exporter. There biggest customer is the USA. If prices fall or we stop importing Chinese goods their screwed. Like I said, you make no sense
7405 2018-07-11 13:57:30 There are capsules called "Evion" eat them and apply one capsule in any type of hair oil ... Its above ordinary tip for the healthy hair
7406 2018-07-11 13:57:27 Absolutely. Also he is representing his oil and arms buddies. He would change his tune if Germany and other Nato allies purchase all their oil and guns from US companies. He likes Saudi Arabia b/c they are buying billions in arms. Follow the love of money.
7407 2018-07-11 13:57:25 CBC's National breaks news !! Los Angeles sits on a ton of oil, pumps it every day, often right next to homes. Some of the oil is even DIRTIER than Alberta's "tar sands" oil. Who knew? Well, kinda, EVERYONE. CBC could have reported this 10 years ago. So why didn't you ???

7416 2018-07-11 13:56:56 Germany needs oil. Simple fact. And they have to get the oil in a proximity to them that allows transport. Much like we have Canadian energy (at least for now). That does not make them "controlled" by Russia. Trump is directly controlled by Putin.
7417 2018-07-11 13:56:53 It was in the context of Germany paying 1% GDP to NATO against the US' much larger amt. Yet they buy oil from Russia.
The article gets to it, eventually, but then continues w/the anti Trump "insulting allies" narrative.
CNN insults its viewers.
7418 2018-07-11 13:56:53 @dpradhanbjp Ji, right time to negotiate oil prices with supplier as every one scared to loose business from India. Iran and USA is flexing muscles. Let two  fight.. we want cheap oil.. @arunjaitley Ji, can we use barter system formula here.
7419 2018-07-11 13:56:50 In fact, your chart shows the import share, not dependency. Dependency means lack of alternatives. In gas, oil and coal, EU has manifold alternatives to Russian resources. Russia is rather dependent on the EU (sales revenues) than vice versa.

7426 2018-07-11 13:56:18 You left out the Oil Pipeline from Russia to Germany.
7427 2018-07-11 13:56:14 hard 2 see how @POTUS telling Germany to stop buying oil from Russia & 2 buy it from USA instead is beneficial 2 Russia. Every other POTUS in the past 30 years has called on @NATO to hit 2% spending & call 4 #FairTrade. Trump is the 1st to enforce it bc he's not owned like u all

7430 2018-07-11 13:55:52 Dunno. Do we still pay R+D cost for big oil even tho they reap billions in assets?

7433 2018-07-11 13:55:34 His goal is to set the stage for lifting Russia sanctions to get the exxon oil fields in Russia producing cash to his and vlad's pocket. That's the quo. That's all his rhetoric on Germany, russia, oil is about. It's ALL about getting Putin paid off... the quo.
7434 2018-07-11 13:55:33 For sure. It’s appropriate to be skeptical of new money. A lot of snake oil being sold out there. But there’s a difference between skepticism and belittling anyone who doesn’t use quite the right terminology or seems old fashioned about it.

7448 2018-07-11 13:54:05 Germany is hoping to reduce its uses of Coal so it's increasing the need for gas. Germany currently building Gas Pipeline to Russia and it's privately funded. Just because the US depend on Asia for its Oil does not mean Asia control the US. Got it?
7449 2018-07-11 13:53:58 This, of course, is stupid.  Imagine the leader of another NATO country telling us we shouldn't purchase Middle East oil.  So no it's not "just because" you political hack.

7465 2018-07-11 13:51:46 Awesome, United States should have endeavoured to become the top oil producer ever since the OPEC oil crisis in 1970s
7466 2018-07-11 13:51:46 It's easily explainable. The less oil&gas Russia sells the more oil&gas Russia has the mightier she is
7467 2018-07-11 13:51:41 Yes, I don't trust the Rockefeller's like I do the Harkness / Flagler cause it was Dan that donated the first money made from Standard Oil.

7468 2018-07-11 13:51:33 The two things are not mutually exclusive. Trump tries to conflate the two -  international trade and multinational defence are both possible. E.g. US/China trade agreements...China Energy investment in US oil pipelines...Russian businessmen operating in Trump Tower...Slán
7469 2018-07-11 13:51:32 Their goal is to use up everybody else's, be the last one with oil so to speak.

7478 2018-07-11 13:50:52 @realDonaldTrump The oil is under the Libyan soil and no authority is given to you either by you or by your government. There are companies and agreements on oil and that does not mean interfering in how it is managed. You do not have any right, neither you nor your
7479 2018-07-11 13:50:47 Lower gas prices in the US are good. The US is not dependent on exporting oil. China is doing the US a favor. You can’t twist it as this is a bad deal.
7480 2018-07-11 13:50:45 Putin won when Germany agreed to pay it billions for oil. Germany won for many years by letting America pay for its Cold War protection. So everyone’s winning except America. That’s in the process of being fixed. Pay attention.
7481 2018-07-11 13:50:40 Captive to russia,  but just signed a huge oil deal with them....
7482 2018-07-11 13:50:34 Again, not a Trump fan, but, he's right. Why is Gemany getting it's oil from Russia? A pipe line bypass Poland and goes straight to Germany.Hmmmm.

The response will be from the people, and I am speaking on behalf of the people. Libyan oil is owned by the Libyan people, not by the US government.
7487 2018-07-11 13:50:18 “My passion isn’t oil&gas, but it helps fund my Pokemon addiction, from which I derive all my wizard powers.”
7488 2018-07-11 13:50:13 I'm not sure about that. In fact, there are rivers with oil flooding because the workers are not qualified.
7489 2018-07-11 13:50:07 I don’t think Iran ever supported India, it was only the interest of Gwadar and during earlier sanctions India imported oil , which kept them mum. But GOI has to relook at its policy of following US sanctions, when even large no. of Europeans don’t agree.
7490 2018-07-11 13:50:00 We get oil from shady countries, what's his point?
7491 2018-07-11 13:49:58 Syria needs giant desalination and arrogation plants (maybe even nuclear-bases as oil fields are occupied by the USA) to be safe in terms of food production.
7492 2018-07-11 13:49:58 Then protect our forests instead of selling them off to oil, gas and lumber industries.  Hypocrisy.
7493 2018-07-11 13:49:52 Or is he laying the ground work to drop Russia santions so USA too can get us some russian oil when, post sanctions lifting, Exxon can develop those billions of acres it owns sitting idle until scantions are killed? It always has to do with lining his pockets.
7494 2018-07-11 13:49:51 No conditioner.  Oil.

7496 2018-07-11 13:49:43 US Secretly of State Pompeo says Washington could grant some countries waivers from US sanctions on Iranian oil exports, which are set to take effect from Nov. Realisation after China UK, Germany & France rejecting  US sanctions?
7497 2018-07-11 13:49:30 All mayo is at it's core is eggs and oil, both of which are already in most pancakes. You don't taste it.
7498 2018-07-11 13:49:27 I use coconut oil.
7499 2018-07-11 13:49:18 Don’t think there’s an easy solution or answer.

Ever see the statistics on the population growth that is in direct correlation with the oil economy?

In the end, greed got us here.

7501 2018-07-11 13:49:12 Metaphorical argument? Cut the BS. Seems Germany has OIL AND GAS from Russia! VERY GREEN & RENEWABLE right? Admit that your argument makes no sense!
7502 2018-07-11 13:48:57 I’d say don’t try to control the water color too much. Relax and kinda let it do its thing. Water color is great if you don’t try to use it like acrylic or oil. Tyler and @Hilzjenkins are masters of this.
7503 2018-07-11 13:48:52 So because they get oil from Russia (we get oil from Arab countries), they are totally "controlled" by Russia? The only one controlled by Russia is Trump.
7504 2018-07-11 13:48:50 -create and stick to a skincare routine

-Put coconut oil on your eyebrows and eyelashes every morning and night to make them grow longer

-Take your makeup off with coconut oil (it takes off waterproof makeup really fast!) this is a quick and natural way to take off you makeup
7505 2018-07-11 13:48:38 Question: Could Canada place tarriffs on the oil that they sell to us?  And, if things continue to degenerate with POTUS acting like a spoiled child, how damaging would a Canadian oil 
EMBARGO be to the US?

7509 2018-07-11 13:48:11 When Putin went into Crimea then into Ukraine what did he threaten them with? The bill they owed on Oil and Gas and cutting off the pipe line.

7517 2018-07-11 13:47:30 You rip Germany for getting its energy from Russia while you get your money and the Presidency from Russia.

You rip Germany for a conflict of interest over a pipeline when you approved the Keystone XL oil pipelines that you’re heavily invested in.

You are an embarrassment.

7519 2018-07-11 13:47:17 Putin already has most of Europe under his thumb because he is supplying them with oil and natural gas.  And Germany agreed to a pipeline deal.  They gave Putin all the leverage he needs. If Putin gets frisky all he has to do is shut off the supplies.

7524 2018-07-11 13:46:37 It’s weird... he told them to stop buying oil from Russia. Doesn’t sound like he’s on their side to me.
7525 2018-07-11 13:46:27 How can anyone disagree with what Trump said about Russia/Germany?

"Germany got rid of their coal/nuclear then buys oil/gas from Russia and wants us (NATO/US) to defend them from Russia?"

Does making Putin rich while he threatens Europe make sense? #Insane

7536 2018-07-11 13:45:39 Isn't POTUS claim that Germany gets energy from Russia a little hypocritical when you consider that most nations are beholden to others for similar things?  We get most of our oil from Canada  dont we ?
7537 2018-07-11 13:45:29 I’ll take our $3 Bill in oil and nat has revenue over 1.5 Bill in weed.
7538 2018-07-11 13:45:10 Exactly. Crypto is worth nothing except any cash you can convince other rubes to give you for it. It's cyber snake oil.
7539 2018-07-11 13:44:58 What choice does Europe have though in paying Russia for energy ? The USA does not have the infrastructure in place to replace Russian oil/natural gas yet and to do without ,is not an option unless Europe goes totally nuclear .
7540 2018-07-11 13:44:49 And you wonder why you're called Fake News. 
Did you even listen and comprehend what President Trump was saying? I'm pretty sure NATO was created to defend Europe against Russia. So why would Germany give billions to Russia for an oil and gas pipeline?
7541 2018-07-11 13:44:48 actually, @POTUS telling Germany to stop buying oil from Russia and to buy it from the USA instead is definitely not at the delight of Putin. You're just too dumb to know WTF you're talking about

7543 2018-07-11 13:44:39 Germany is making Russia richer by buying their gas and oil while they use our military to protect them from...Russia? Germany is reliant on Russia for energy lining Putin’s pockets while we waste billions defending them from...Putin? Such nonsense

7545 2018-07-11 13:44:28 Dude I don’t get it too like why should we buy form Saudi Arabia instead of buying form Bigeria and other oil producing African countries it’s can cost us lower and make money stays in Africa.
7546 2018-07-11 13:44:28 You won’t label me liberal or conservative. I WILL vote. I don’t trust those who blindly follow one rigid dogma.

7547 2018-07-11 13:44:27 And that's not the moter oil folks lmao
7548 2018-07-11 13:44:16 Oil: Boom and bust, rinse and repeat. Just gotta be on the right side of the trade. Still a lot of boom left in this cycle
7549 2018-07-11 13:44:13 We'll see, but Germany isn't the only country France is also and others, they could have got oil elsewhere, but chose this route why? Because everyone high up was getting Russian paybacks.
7550 2018-07-11 13:44:08 Two things definitely provided zero contribution to this epic rescue - @pureflix Michael Scott or an imaginary friend.

7562 2018-07-11 13:42:49 TX-News 2018-07-11 09:36:25 : Saudi Arabia hiked its oil output in June to the highest level since the end of 2016, as it aims to cool the market after crude prices recently rose to 3½-year highs. -- CNBC

7564 2018-07-11 13:42:43 Too bad the Republicans went to keep s chained to middle eastern oil and coal. At least Obama tried to move us forward and IRONICALLY the Saudi’s are sinking billions into their own renewable energy research because they see the world is moving away from oil....
7565 2018-07-11 13:42:42 Wasn’t that same type of charge leveled at us when we were dependent on the Saudis for oil? When vital resources are in the control of a potential adversary, isn’t there a risk? Same thing applies to cheap Chinese electronics.

7570 2018-07-11 13:42:15 Meathead, Germany is buying a large percentage of its oil from Russia. Dependence on Russian oil is a disaster. We're paying into NATO to protect Germany from Russia. What is wrong with this picture. Rob Reiner is blinded by his bias. @realDonaldTrump @dbongino @RealJack

7590 2018-07-11 13:41:05 There's really no sabotage involved. Trump does what he does best, belittle players he doesn't agree with and/or respect and/or like. Don't know the details of the German/Russian oil project, but you can bet that a comment like that plays well to his base.

7603 2018-07-11 13:40:04 Bullshit. He's beholden to the US taxpayer and he's tired of the United States subsidizing European socialism while they sit on their asses and do nothing. He's literally telling them NOT to do business with Russia on oil and gas!
7604 2018-07-11 13:40:02 So, the US is controlled by the countries we get our oil from too then?

I got my oil changed by my local, non-chain mechanic, and then got an iced latte from our neighborhood coffee shop. I am so thrilled to live in the neighborhood we do. #prgirl #Donovans #coffeexchange
7617 2018-07-11 13:39:21 At 9:35am  I got a correlation sell signal for the Crude Oil WTI Futures (CLQ18) and USO on my software.
7618 2018-07-11 13:39:15 Why, you think it's okay for Germany to buy Russian oil while claiming they need protection from Russia?
7619 2018-07-11 13:39:13 For how long will he be talking about inherited empty treasury, how much is the present oil price? What did he do with all the recovered money?
7620 2018-07-11 13:39:13 I don't change my oil until Jamie is yelling at me
7621 2018-07-11 13:39:09 Tapos prep ug tissue ibutang sa plate daan or bond paper haha basta kanang pwede mo absorb uv oil para kuhaon niya ang mantika sa pancake. Hulata na mag brown before i flip para dili mag kalat haha.
7622 2018-07-11 13:39:07 Ok. I’m going to go to Costco and buy a pallet of vegetable oil, lighter fluid, and matches. Pick a place.

7624 2018-07-11 13:39:02 Retweeted Ana Navarro (@ananavarro):

Trump tells NATO, Germany is controlled by Russia because that’s from where Germany gets its oil.
Ok, well, by that logic....
Trump is controlled by Russia because that’s from where Trump got his presidency.
7625 2018-07-11 13:39:01 Bio oil cobaa

7632 2018-07-11 13:38:18 Oil City is small town in PA. Pretty sure they do not have professional  team. In fact 99% of the people there have likely never attended  game. You'd be hard pressed to find 1 person who knew who Mahrez is let alone name 1 player for Man City. So you posted made me chuckle.
7633 2018-07-11 13:38:10 Yes, potentially stripping Russia of a main oil export shows puppetry on behalf of Trump.

7635 2018-07-11 13:37:45 Or OPEC, where we get a log of oil.
7636 2018-07-11 13:37:33 If EU boys oil from Russia
How would NATO ever fight Russia when all Putin needs to do is turn off the tap? 

It’s time they start buying American oil or start paying their own defense bill
7637 2018-07-11 13:37:31 Dan is gonna be so excited!  Thanks Jimmy!! Now we can get our oil burner upgraded and the water boiler repaired!  That thing is always threatening to flood our basement!  ;)

7663 2018-07-11 13:35:40 So this morning was eventful.
I decided to bake muffins & I got everything ready & read the instructions, but proceeded to ignore them. Instead of 1tbsp of veggie oil and 1/3 cup of milk, I pour 1/3 cup of milk AND 1/3 cup of veggie oil
My lesson: stay OUT of the kitchen
7664 2018-07-11 13:35:39 When should you especially check the engine oil level?
7665 2018-07-11 13:35:39 Saw a video about people in Haiti ate cookies made from the dirt. They mixed it with oil and salt then baked the dirt cookies under the sun

7668 2018-07-11 13:35:35 Sorry John, a fan but, you got it backwards this time. Trumps method was vulgar but...his message was anti-Russian. How else cld u explain his advising Germany their reliance on Russian oil is dangerous?

7676 2018-07-11 13:35:12 Yes as Russia supplies the EU with gas and oil. Big threat
7677 2018-07-11 13:35:12 You overstated German reliance on Russian energy and the pipeline is a commercial venture not government. You said “60 to 70 percent of their energy from Russia” in reality about 20 percent of energy is accounted for by oil and gas imports from Russia. Why do you do this?

7695 2018-07-11 13:33:36 5% of oil revenue should go directly to the local community , county assembly shall enact policies on how the cash transfer is utilised.

7703 2018-07-11 13:33:02 The president criticized Germany, without naming Angela Merkel, for its multi-billion-dollar deal with a Russian energy company; his point being the alliance is supposed to protect countries from Russia but that gas and oil deal!?!?!?!

7705 2018-07-11 13:32:57 This is not controversial. Most recently, I read it in Peter Frankopan’s The Silk Roads. One of the Nazi goals behind the conquest of the Soviet Union and their North African campaign was to seize control of strategic oil reserves, either in Baku or the Middle East.
7706 2018-07-11 13:32:57 So Putin's puppet is telling ALL NATO not to buy Russia oil and gas.
7707 2018-07-11 13:32:35 aku pake milk cleanser aja buat gantiin oil cleansernya
7708 2018-07-11 13:32:33 I love Trump pounding Germany. Telling them they are weak for taking oil & gas from Russia when they want protection from Russia. Trump nailed it.

7711 2018-07-11 13:32:15 If it's synthetic, yea RT @AddiKted2RetAil: $80 for an oil change normal?
7712 2018-07-11 13:32:08 Trading NATO for Arctic oil with Putin.  Reduced national debt on our Millennials, more oil revenue for America, safer planet with our world-best environmental safeguards, and shift from multilateral to bilateral agreements.  More winning!
7713 2018-07-11 13:32:03 So Germany buys their oil from Russia and guess what? They should pay more into NATO. Countries in NATO need to pay their fair share. The UNITED STATES should not be paying the high freight.

7720 2018-07-11 13:31:24 If Trump is 'Putin's puppet,' why is he telling NATO to not buy Russian oil?
7721 2018-07-11 13:31:22 He is and always was on board with  Trump's Russia plan,as well as everyone else who is with him and supports him. Mega dollars involved here. Oil and real estate. Europe too poor for the GOP.

7725 2018-07-11 13:31:14 Someone show him a globe so he can see that the Russian oil is closer to Germany than the US oil, thereby making it less expensive (transport costs) and uses less energy in the transport process. Germany is on the cutting edge in renewals.

7729 2018-07-11 13:30:53 I think I grabbed some basil, English thyme, oregano (dried from my previous harvest), and rosemary. That and a bit of olive oil/salt makes for a great flavor.

7734 2018-07-11 13:30:28 It’s complicated. The point is, we are also doing more business with Russia these days. Trump sees to it. He wants his big Russian oil deal to go through.
7735 2018-07-11 13:30:26 Not much news coming out today. Just pumping oil and a yellow waste tanker. No crane movements. 
Did I mention they have been pumping oil, about 44 hours now! 
7736 2018-07-11 13:30:20 There would be no cars on the road without “foreign” electronics, no houses built without “foreign” lumber, no heat in our homes without “foreign” oil...no clean bathrooms at Mar-a- Lago without “foreign” workers...and on and on and on

7739 2018-07-11 13:30:13 Thank you for clearing this up for us. The article says Germany imported 40% of their oil, 35% of their gas and 32%of their hard coal from Russia. Not 70%

7741 2018-07-11 13:30:11 Follow the money. The oil money. Putin’s thesis on expanding Russia tondays of former glory based on oil wealth is the key fact. Brexit and their actions in Syria destabilize Europe; Trump further destabilizes the west. Where are the calls for climate change action coming from?
7742 2018-07-11 13:30:08 kl oil bisa pake minyak zaitun, kleveru, rosehip oil.

7743 2018-07-11 13:30:07 US suspends visas from Myanmar, Laos following refusal to take back deported citizens.  Trump is right. If Germany gets its gas from Russia they become vulnerable to Russian influence & aggression. Common sense.

They say Russia is an enemy and take their oil. Something is wrong.

7760 2018-07-11 13:28:48 I'm no fan of the President but he's right on this one. Her personal story notwithstanding, Russia has long used energy exports to exert control over it's customers. Increasing their dependence on Russian oil is strategically insane.
7761 2018-07-11 13:28:43 @EITMonline do you think he checked her oil before they died?

7764 2018-07-11 13:28:15 So using his logic we are beholden to Saudi Arabia for the billons of dollars of oil we buy and beholden to China for the TRILLIONS of US Treasury Bonds they buy to fund our deficits!  Nice stable genius president reasoning!
7765 2018-07-11 13:28:14 old white people love cbd oil almost as much as they love inprisoning black people for life over a few grams of marijuana and that’s the tea

They’ve made a oil and gas deal with Russia

7769 2018-07-11 13:28:02 all about the #oil actually...always is.
7770 2018-07-11 13:27:59 Then there's all the little things we've had to do for you guys. Like how the French got us stuck in Vietnam while they bailed on us with their "colonial" problems in that part of the world. Or how he greedy English got us to stop the nationalizing  of Iranian's oil in the 50s.
7771 2018-07-11 13:27:51 When they discover one full of oil, America will be all over it.
7772 2018-07-11 13:27:51 Why are Millennials saddled with debt to pay NATO countries, for them to spend it on Russian oil drilled near Alaska without our environmental safeguards?  Fighting for our Millennials.

7775 2018-07-11 13:27:46 Your argument is referring to the question whether Russia is dependent on exporting oil to Europe. The question concerning europes dependency is if Europe has enough infrastructure to replace oil imports from russia and here the answer is different.
7776 2018-07-11 13:27:46 Russia has an oil pipeline into Europe, it keeps transportation costs down versus loading it on tankers and shipping it.

You really want to get angry...they also buy from Iran!

7783 2018-07-11 13:27:09 It's called capitalism ! It's not our business to criticize countries whom get cheaper oil which contributes to their free healthcare for their citizens.
7784 2018-07-11 13:27:07 We have a huge reserve 10th in the world but we are a poor country in all indices of humanity. We must fix our population growth, education, political philosophy, economic model and the biggest boy "Corruption". Please take it from me we are an Oil rich nation blessed by God.

7789 2018-07-11 13:26:49 Before #GDPR people talked about data as gold, now its more like oil & you don’t want a spill — @AmberBaldet of @GrowClovyr #InVest2018
7790 2018-07-11 13:26:45 He wanted to kill the families of terrorists.  And steal a sovereign countries oil.  So yes.
7791 2018-07-11 13:26:36 Well thats good, why would we need any Russian oil?
7792 2018-07-11 13:26:33 Actually Germany gets 70% of their oil and gas from Russia.  Last thing Putin wants is this brought to the worlds attention.  Pay up Europe!  #NATOSummit

7794 2018-07-11 13:26:31 plucking my eyebrows using tweezers lol

and applying some castor oil to thicken it

lol whats wrong with me
i aint even face concious before  maturing? HAHAHA
7795 2018-07-11 13:26:26 I get so confused by Trumps arguments. He is saying that Germany should not expect to be defended against Russia while getting so much oil from them. BUT what about when NATO defended us in the middle east (after 9/11) despite the fact that we get so much oil from them?
7796 2018-07-11 13:26:25 ﾝﾝｯｗｗｗｗｗｗｗわかりました！！！！　あまりにも修羅の道の織さん…
7797 2018-07-11 13:26:22 So we will pay for defense against Russia while they pay Russia billions for an oil pipeline making them richer stronger and more powerful makes a lot of sense

7800 2018-07-11 13:26:18 No one besides Zogbots care if they buy oil from Russia.
7801 2018-07-11 13:26:15 i know it just makes me more anxious but i cant not know whats going on in the world. years ago my sister somehow missed the big BP oil spill and i cant let that happen to me
7802 2018-07-11 13:26:08 There’s another way?
7803 2018-07-11 13:26:08 Today Crude oil inventory matters most. If inventory down, crude will go up sharply. If inventory up ten crude will down another 1-2 %
7804 2018-07-11 13:26:07 You’re woefully ill informed. The U.S. imposed broad trade sanctions against Iran in 1979, and 1987, particularly targeting petrochemical export and production. Obama lifted these in 2015, and Trump reimposed. EU imports Iranian oil, of course.  Easy on the sexual insults.

7808 2018-07-11 13:25:54 Why should the US fund the protection of the borders with Russia while Germany buys oil from Russia? And why call out Putin for supplying that oil? Russian and American peaceful trade and cooperation, and NATO spending reduced from 2% to 1% would be a good thing... no??
7809 2018-07-11 13:25:32 Are we going to defend Trump to invade countries or support regimes to keep the oil?

7814 2018-07-11 13:25:12 Because Putin secretly doesn't have as much oil as he claims. Nobody will know his dirty little secret if they never attempt to buy more than he has.
7815 2018-07-11 13:25:12 Does that price include the land & how long is left on the contract with the current oil company?

7831 2018-07-11 13:24:00 Dear American citizens: Mr Trump obviously does not understand the difference between buying something (oil and gas from Russia) and spending money (on defense). Germany has agreed to ramp up defense spending to 2% up to 2020 and it will do as promised.

7845 2018-07-11 13:22:52 He would have taken the oil, he said.
7846 2018-07-11 13:22:46 (Nah, do it until the cows come home xD)
7847 2018-07-11 13:22:39 So, if the car industry is turning to electric vehicles, how long until the folks who have oil as their sole income can’t buy pet cheetahs anymore? 

7848 2018-07-11 13:22:37 Can i come and put more oil over you lol well lets pretent its oil lmao .you mayhave to help meshake the bottle tho

7851 2018-07-11 13:22:16 But look @ difference when FF got started - gubmint attacked Standard Oil for being the best at what it did - bringing most product to most people at lowest price.  Anti-trust brought us ... HIGHER prices! RE is opposite, gubmint helping them.
7852 2018-07-11 13:22:13 Think the oil might need checking
7853 2018-07-11 13:22:04 Stop adding anymore oil to fire. I don't want to see the two people whom I greatly admire arguing at each other like this.

7855 2018-07-11 13:21:57 He's so drunk with power, I don't think he realizes he may have upset Putin by criticising Europe's dependence on Russian oil! He's messing with Putin's economy at a time when Russian economy's not so good. So his meeting with Putin may not go so well after all. (I can only hope)
7856 2018-07-11 13:21:57 Sure, that's why he's challenging Germany and their Russian oil pipeline which is a cash cow for Russia. He's not trying to destroy NATO. He's asking for it to be a true ally. Fraud.

7868 2018-07-11 13:21:22 If Germany is controlled by Russia due to an oil pipeline, is the US controlled by China due to the trillions of dollars they owe the Chinese @realDonaldTrump ??
7869 2018-07-11 13:21:20 Every single time.
7870 2018-07-11 13:21:18 That and the OPEC agreement that all oil trades have to be made using dollars, regardless of the nation selling/buying.

7874 2018-07-11 13:21:01 Perhaps oil was driven up, because it actually has some value, unlike most tech stocks. lol

7886 2018-07-11 13:20:30 Just annouced, Germany will begin to scale back their export of oil to Russia potentially losing millions in revenue out of fear the U.S. will end their long standing NATO alliance. Also, Germany will begin to contribute 2% GDP effective immediately. Trump, later, called Putin...

7900 2018-07-11 13:19:42 Wrong, Europe buys oil from Russia, but is not more dependent as any other country in the world, since as far as I remember, oil is a globally traded commodity.
7901 2018-07-11 13:19:34 Olive Oil hasn't woken up yet. I've been trying since 7:50.. It's now 9:20

7906 2018-07-11 13:19:20 All about US nat gas glut. Big problem for US oil producers due to fracking process. Need to offshore it.
7907 2018-07-11 13:19:19 The way to free ourselves from dominance by oil is with advanced nuclear power, as in @MoltenSaltReactors. Make power, water and industrial heat.

7909 2018-07-11 13:19:09 Germany buying Russian oil doesn't give them much leverage to apply pressure when there are countless other options for getting oil.  It's not like they have a Pee Tape to hold over their head.
7910 2018-07-11 13:19:09 Why do oil changes take so long when you take your truck to an Express place.
7911 2018-07-11 13:19:06 Your source says that 40% of germany's oil imports and 32% of its coal imports comes from russia. Adding gas to that, no matter how small... doesn't it place russia in a more powerful position against Germany?
7912 2018-07-11 13:18:58 $80 for an oil change normal?
7913 2018-07-11 13:18:54 On that subject, I think it’s best to find what suits you skin best and stick with it. Been using kernel oil for months now and it’s been great.
7914 2018-07-11 13:18:53 Thank you. I put so much effort in my cooking. (*´∀`*) I try to reduce oil and stuff like that for him.

7916 2018-07-11 13:18:50 Dubai has approximately 4 billion barrels of oil in reserve and holds the second place in terms of oil reserves in the UAE. Dubai Petroleum Co (DPC) is the main operator in the emirate. #oil #oil reserves #https://lnkd.in/fxTu2uh

7919 2018-07-11 13:18:36 Sure, nothing better to do now than troll with ridiculous statements. The article is about oil and water leaking, oilfield fluids are measured/sold in oilfield barrels. The physical barrels are usually made of metal and contain 42 US gallons.

France/Sweden/Ontario should be the goal here, as low carbon as possible.

7929 2018-07-11 13:18:14 I agree in principal but this also gives NATO some economic leverage over Russia. Putin KNOWS the US can produce oil and sell it to Europe, he cannot hang that over their heads as in the past. If Russia loses that income, he's in a world of hurt.
7930 2018-07-11 13:18:09 Can you really call him a bodybuilder if he's injecting oil into his arms?
7931 2018-07-11 13:18:05 okay so i'm at my uncle's auto shop for an oil change and watching julie's vlog. my phone automatically connects to the car when it's started so he just heard "THICC BOYS IN HONG KONG BE LIKE" AND AJSJHDKDJRHRJ

7935 2018-07-11 13:17:53 Even if Trump's claim referred to "energy", German imports of oil, gas and coal from Russia accounted for about 26.7% of German primary energy consumption in 2017.

8027 2018-07-11 13:11:27 Trump making the point that Germany gets their oil & gas from Russia really shows his stupidity. They have coal but no oil fields. That’s what crippled Hitler when the allies destroyed the plant that made their fuel from coal.
8028 2018-07-11 13:11:19 Stopping Germany from buying billions in oil and natural gas from Russia would cripple Russia's economy.  Why do you support Russia?

8051 2018-07-11 13:09:41 Nigeria has oil,something we don't have, that why our petrol price is high,but with Nigeria's help we can really benefit from this.

8153 2018-07-11 13:03:02 You're missing the point. Russia not being in OPEC is exactly why the OPEC crisis of the 70s led to GOP/Russia partnership. The then-USSR was struggling economically and the US had 18% of the world's population but was consuming a majority of the oil supply.

8164 2018-07-11 13:02:24 Trump says that a pipeline from Russia controls Germany?
LOL! Canada has several pipelines feeding oil & natural gas to USA!
I guess Canada "totally controls" USA!

8167 2018-07-11 13:02:17 Oil is not unhealthy if you are following keto diet 
8168 2018-07-11 13:02:17 #TrumpNatSecRisk at #NATOSummit  He is targeting the Russian oil deal with Germany in order to set the stage for an oil deal for Russia and for lifting the sanctions.  This is the #TrumpRussia con man at work. Remember #RexTillerson ?
8169 2018-07-11 13:01:58 Strange spin by you. Trump attacks a pipeline deal, that not only enriches prior German chancellor, but also Russia. Germany wants us to protect them against Russia, yet relies on Russia for 70% of its oil. Weaken Russia’s oil industry is the way Trump and NATO destroy Russia.
8170 2018-07-11 13:01:53 It’s selfish to prevent another nation from cutting off your access to oil that you paid for and using that access to hold the oil you paid for hostage for money, policy change, kicks and giggles? Making it vulnerable to terrorists? 

Would America do the same?
8171 2018-07-11 13:01:47 What lies about nato and allies? Europe buys gas and oil from Russia, lots of it, Trump calls them out, but he's lying about it? 2002 agreement to raise defense spending to 2%GDP and they have yet to hit it? Again, what lie? That not enough time?  Nato is a joke.

8174 2018-07-11 13:01:20 Germany purchases oil and gas from Russia due to economic necessity and market affordability. I doubt Trump could argue his Election Campaign’s dealings with Mother Russia were as necessary. Or without its fine print.
8175 2018-07-11 13:01:19 The Russians in this case are not involved. They wanted Hillary and her ear on fossil fuels yo win because Russia wants no competition to their oil. Vietnam War protest activist were funded by Russia. Typically duped load mouth academics.

8198 2018-07-11 12:59:22 I’ve been watching this Norwegian series called “Occupied”. It’s about Norway turning off their oil & gas supply to go fully green and the EU are livid. So they get Russia to pretty much invade and force Norway to supply them oil and gas.

8294 2018-07-11 12:50:24 Germany wants our protection, yet they buy their oil from Russia.
You see a problem here?
8295 2018-07-11 12:50:22 So, based on oil purchases, the U.S. is beholden to Canada??
8296 2018-07-11 12:50:20 We pay to protect Germany from Russia and Germany is buying oil and natural gas from Russia instead of the US.....a good leader asks why.
8297 2018-07-11 12:50:14 Have you tried cheeses made from coconut oil. They taste great & melt really well (the cheese melts quickly so you don't warm it up for too long) 
8298 2018-07-11 12:50:11 #WTI $73.26 (-1.15%) #Brent $77.36 (-1.90%) - both #oil benchmarks in decline, its not all down to #Trump, data playing role too #OOTT #oilandgas

8300 2018-07-11 12:50:03 CEA Says: Govt To Its Credit Has Stuck To Fiscal Consolidation During High Oil Prices
8301 2018-07-11 12:50:03 Agree with everything, aside for coconut oil
8302 2018-07-11 12:50:03 @Morning_Joe Most of  Americas oil imports currently come from five countries: Canada, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Venezuela and Nigeria. So how does Trump think we are different than any European country? He has no capacity to evaluate or reflect before he open his mouth!
8303 2018-07-11 12:49:56 Wrong. He said oil and gas - he made the claim about all of Germany’s energy. Natural gas only makes up 20% of Germans energy.
8304 2018-07-11 12:49:52 It's all about oil who's buying oil from Russia and who isn't buying oil from the USA, it's that simple.
8305 2018-07-11 12:49:51 No! By CANADA! Kneel before CANADA! You buy our wonderful CANADIAN oil! #Oil #CrudeButPolite  
And of course Saudi Arabia too.

8306 2018-07-11 12:49:45 So Trump's tantrums abroad will totally dominate all market movements today. Tariffs, oil for Germany, Russia, NATO and whatever the bozo wants to spew on 

Back in my country, Canada we are waiting to see if Governor of Bank of Canada raises interest rates by 0.25. Pins&needles
8307 2018-07-11 12:49:30 . @SarahPalinUSA says Sacha Baron Cohen is disrespecting U.S. veterans. I disagree, but in any event it’s better to disrespect them than be a part of a political party that sends them into pointless and illegal wars to be maimed and killed for oil rights.

8310 2018-07-11 12:49:25 So you want Germany to depend on Russian oil
8311 2018-07-11 12:49:23 Trump is speaking truth to power with a dose of common sense and castor oil.
8312 2018-07-11 12:49:21 Russia supplies oil and gas to Europe Europe pays Russia billions for it.

To me, this explains why he's launched at breakfast about Germany's (Europe's) pipelines to Russian oil.  It sounds anti-Russia, but that line controls RF as EU goes renewable.

OPEC predict demand on their oil in Q4 18 at 33.6mbpd 
Add back Lybia, so still 1mbpd short. Saudi spare capacity only1.6mbpd, means any drop in Iran/Ven above 600kbpd means market short

8352 2018-07-11 12:45:46 Hey Trump, because your kinship has German roots, only so much that they wrote history in this area a thousand years ago, our US did not even exist in a dream. And we have been dependent for many decades on oil from Saudi Arabia, through this country.

8391 2018-07-11 12:42:54 Still waiting for someone to argue the merits of Trump's accusation. Is Germany buying oil from Russia in NATO's best interest or no?

8393 2018-07-11 12:42:44 @arnielayne @JoeNBC @stuartpstevens @RonBrownstein @SteveSchmidtSES 

Given this logic, we are controlled by Saudi Arabia from whom we buy crude oil. And by countries who buy our debt and fund our deficits.

8421 2018-07-11 12:39:56 @realDonaldTrump whatever Putin wants, Donnie does it. Not even realizing it. Good thing Merkel spends money for education, a word y oil u guys at FOX and your GOP friends don't want the American people to be able to spell. We should look into the ownership of FOX. Russian money?
8422 2018-07-11 12:39:43 Sheer nonsense. Russia doing so would simply result in a shift towards western oil. This is a question of market monopoly.
8423 2018-07-11 12:39:41 It's awesome. What do you not understand about "America First"? All the European Union are the real puppets of Putin buying their Oil and Gas from Russia. AND not paying their fair share.
8424 2018-07-11 12:39:38 I agree, but no one seems to be arguing the merits of Trump's oil charge against Germany. Just shouts of "he's projecting." Honestly, how does Germany square this with the mission of NATO?
8425 2018-07-11 12:39:29 Someone died in England.. but yes let's help Trump out by pretending he's questioning an oil pipeline..
8426 2018-07-11 12:39:27 Throw it in a cast iron pan with oil in it and let it cook in the sun
8427 2018-07-11 12:39:26 Nope, Obama sanctions hurt Putin’s economy. Trump wants them removed. Putin has been doing much better since oil prices rose following Trump’s withdrawal from Iran deal.
8428 2018-07-11 12:39:26 Snake oil is clearly addictive.
8429 2018-07-11 12:39:24 So it's because he blocked corruption that there's insecurity in the land? It's the reason it took him 6 months to have minister? It's the same reason corrupt individual are walking free under him? So what's the price of oil now and then,has that reduced the price of oil?
8430 2018-07-11 12:39:21 Lybian oil coming back online but u.s. data supportive
8431 2018-07-11 12:39:21 The US imports 40% of its oil  from Canada: its single largest supplier. @realDonaldTrump, can you be trusted if your energy supply is controlled by a foreign govt that is an openly democratic socialist state?

8433 2018-07-11 12:39:16 Good to know to avoid Lucas Oil for supporting domestic terrorists.
8434 2018-07-11 12:39:15 Trump is absolutely right!! He is protecting the interest of the United States, and of the Europeans, at the same time are finding out the treasonous ways of their hipocritical political leaders, talking bad about Russia, and at the same time, buying huge amounts of Russian oil

8439 2018-07-11 12:38:48 This is so much shortsighted ignorance, not realizing DE can purchase coal/oil/energy, winning more than enough time to restructure energy grid, assuming war in a vacuum between DE vs Russia, + not understanding how equally if not more dependent Russia is on imports from DE/EU.
8440 2018-07-11 12:38:43 Good luck to all those competing tonight in the Mr Oil County Senior Track and Field Championships Day 2 in Enniscorthy. Go out and enjoy it as its the last track meet in the County this year!
8441 2018-07-11 12:38:37 Odd question. The Europeans have plenty of shale gas and oil under their own lands.
8442 2018-07-11 12:38:32 So basically Germany should spend MANY times more $ getting off the oil. Military spending should not include one nickle to US based company's. Not as long as the gop is extorting them.
8443 2018-07-11 12:38:27 Ayy y’all get these wax/oil cartridges from me! Not for the baby lungs
8444 2018-07-11 12:38:16 Thanks for this information. I only use coconut oil in my hair anyway. I was just shocked to see it was no good because I thought surely it was popular as a lotion for others.
8445 2018-07-11 12:38:14 I’m really busting my ass in these sandals smh too much oil
8446 2018-07-11 12:37:58 More like Oil Slick.
8447 2018-07-11 12:37:55 Maybe Germany should purchase their gas/oil (
8448 2018-07-11 12:37:54 5. REFUGEES, just like he wants to stop South American Hispanic refugees. Those nations that concern you produce lots of oil, aren’t producing refugees, and they sure don’t have a Trump Hotel.
8449 2018-07-11 12:37:48 Why would ANY NATO Country buy OIL or others major items from Russia, one of the largest adversaries to the FREE WORLD! Makes no sense to me what so ever!  How much debt from WWII do some of these Counties has been forgiven, to help them get back on there feet, time to support!
8450 2018-07-11 12:37:47 Peppermint oil is a gift from God
8451 2018-07-11 12:37:16 Just how America purchases oil from Saudi and arms the regime that's blowing up the Houthi people in Yemen, perhaps if the US and to a lesser extent the UK enforced trade embargo's on Saudi, maybe that would be a strong move...#DoubleStandards #Hypocrisy

8460 2018-07-11 12:36:29 @maddow Is trump is setting the table for USA to buy our energy from #Russia? Who’s reporting oil production or recent and pending energy deals with #Russia? We need to know if this was the master plan all along? #PutinsPuppet is certainly paying off! #putinwon #wearescrewed
8461 2018-07-11 12:36:28 Buy American oil. We protect you. Trump is amping up our oil supply so we can export.
8462 2018-07-11 12:36:24 Nna I fry the onions le green peppers first then I add the carrots I normally use rajah le the chakalala flavored spice.. Then ones those are cooked I add the koo beans.. It's normally just soupy by itself mainly cause of the oil but lately started adding bit of sweet chilli
8463 2018-07-11 12:36:17 ain’t that the truth !! no oil change tune ups just same regular ones . Like come on now where someone who has everything new going for themselves !?
8464 2018-07-11 12:36:16 To add to the health updates, I pulled a muscle in my shoulder last night while crawling under the car changing the oil. Pretty sore today. I might go see my chiropractor.

8467 2018-07-11 12:36:06 the real solution is in making easy to confer cooking oil. If we still need to move to reach a storage area it will be reallly difficult to better recycle %

8474 2018-07-11 12:35:26 The reality we’ve collectively refused to admit is this;Prior to his administration our economy strived on:Oil & Corruption.Unfortunately the petrol dollar dropped globally & he blocked corruption to an extent. The consequence is hunger & anger in the land.

8483 2018-07-11 12:34:53 He blocked me when I corrected another of his ranting tweets where he used the swampy/NIMBY rubbish about someone who needed oil for the engine in their electric car!
8484 2018-07-11 12:34:51 It was @theotherlivvy who made it for my birthday on Monday - am sure she'd be happy to give you the recipe! I made the garlic butter last night: 100g unsalted butter, 4 garlic cloves, 1.5 tbsp olive oil, large pinch of good salt.
8485 2018-07-11 12:34:32 Are you serious? Tanks also run on oil which is bought from the Middle East, not Russia. Needing tanks implies war, which would be a world war and no one in EU would have Russian gas. Reserves don't need to last forever, they need to last until Germany finds an interim solution.

8494 2018-07-11 12:33:21 And expect US to provide protection against Russia at the same time. By the the time they pay Russia for their pipeline deluvery of Oil they could pay up more for DEFENSE.Trump acted like a RedNeck Ignorant. He does not know ditwah about Diplomacy and history of NATO. TG the
8495 2018-07-11 12:33:07 In addition of Russia wanted to invade E Europe all they would need is to close every pipeline and the German economy grinds to a halt within days. We could invade the middle ast and take thier oil if direly needed the Germans can do that at all.

8506 2018-07-11 12:32:16 The US has become a oil exporting nation. They probably want to sell natural gas to Germany.

8560 2018-07-11 12:26:50 Jim, what do you not understand about "America First"? All the European Union are the real puppets of Putin buying their Oil and Gas from Russia.
8561 2018-07-11 12:26:49 Donald Trump recently begged Saudi Arabia to increase its oil output in order to keep a lid on oil prices. Therefore
given who are the energy suppliers is any energy consuming country 'safe'?

#wato
8562 2018-07-11 12:26:48 Trump lie about Germany/EU getting oil from Russia,here's a fact: Most of  Americas imports currently come from five countries: Canada, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Venezuela and Nigeria. What does he say about that!!
Not only ignorant but Trump wont explore renewable energy either!
8563 2018-07-11 12:26:46 who funds malaria, aids research? Bill Gates

8570 2018-07-11 12:26:04 God is bad. Isn't it? He has given oil reserves to Muslim countries and made us, the Hindus, depend on them.
8571 2018-07-11 12:25:50 Could the Russians use gas/oil supplies as a weapon? Yes, they have done so before. 

Could they use non-military means to attempt to destabilize nations and NATO? Obviously. They did it in Ukraine, UK/Brexit, 2016 USA elections, and at least tried in French & German elections.
8572 2018-07-11 12:25:44 Oil stocks will crash in this weekend. Not exactly.　　石油株は今週末に暴落するだろう。いや、そうでもないよ。
8573 2018-07-11 12:25:43 “Germany is totally controlled by Russia.”      Trump at NATO.                 He castigates Germany for making oil/gas deal with Russia and the former Chancellor of Germany for being the head of the pipeline company supplying the gas.  @realDonaldTrump  is jealous.

8580 2018-07-11 12:24:39 i really should stop using oil paint to my sketchbook. di naman siya masama but, even i want to use and paint at the next page pagkatapos ko don sa previous, i just can't. kasi kailangan ko pang maghintay para matuyo yung oil. 

so, i messed up again. kasi di ko na kinaya.

8582 2018-07-11 12:24:05 #UKOG looking strong moving in to the afternoon. RNS expected in next day or two stating oil is being pumped / collected by tanker 
8583 2018-07-11 12:24:03 The prime objective is not to get 2 per cent funding from allies...it is to demonstrate to Putin that he is a good puppet and will drive a wedge between USA and allies. Gift to Putin will be Alaksa and artic oil. Russia is in control of Trump
8584 2018-07-11 12:23:53 Let's get that oil change taken care of today
8585 2018-07-11 12:23:49 Since Germany is dependent on Russia for its oil, the two nations have a mutual interest to mainstain PEACE not WAR. That is a GOOD thing.

NATO then is a wasteful, unnecessary project.

8597 2018-07-11 12:22:33 I’ll add that this shows you @realDonaldTrump hypocrisy while simultaneously showing you how deep into the oil industry’s pocketbook he is.
8598 2018-07-11 12:22:24 When Germany dumped nuclear power
the placed themselves in a self imposed vice.
Trump got increased oil production from Saudi Arabia
but Merkel has to do more than head in sand

8604 2018-07-11 12:21:42 Thank god we have a president who will call it as he sees it. Why we paying more than the rest of them. Why Germany will be buying oil& gas from Russia when they can buy it from us. Why are we protecting Germany from Russia then?
8605 2018-07-11 12:21:38 One way to look at the issue of Germany, the biggest economy in Europe, buying nearly all of its oil from Russia is....wait for it....wait for it....

RUSSIA IS NOT EUROPE'S ENEMY

8609 2018-07-11 12:21:31 Engaging Russia in trade is a way to prevent conflict. Nations who trade generally do not go to war.

The Russians have gas & oil. Western Europe wants gas & oil. Pipelines are cheaper than oil tankers. This is not hard.
8610 2018-07-11 12:21:29 You never did anything for free! You did it for your countrys interest. You could have retreated after WW2, but you did´nt. You did it for trade deals, for Bretton Woods, for oil, for wanting to be a Superpower. So if you want to be a big player than you have to pay for it.

8618 2018-07-11 12:21:05 Looks to me like Trump was saying “you can’t have an alliance formed against someone and then rely on them for natural gas and oil.”
Stoltenberg was making a lofty statement about NATO being stronger when unified against Russia.
Trump’s a terrible stooge for Putin.

8623 2018-07-11 12:20:31 I don't think so. Russia didn't fair well in the last recession and the #1 and #2 collapse will also collapse oil prices. But that's the price Putin is willing to pay. Not him personally - he is already the richest man in the world, albeit not officially.
8624 2018-07-11 12:20:26 Dont ever doubt POTUS.  He has given fake nato what for.  Think about what he said to nato : you make lucrative oil & gas deals with russia and then want us to protect you.  i want to add: And pay for the protection we give them.
8625 2018-07-11 12:20:22 If your face is oily don't load it up with pressed powder which will block your pores and produce oil and acne! Soak up oil with tissue.

8643 2018-07-11 12:18:39 All of Germany's oil use amounts to 34.5% of total primary energy consumption in 2017, so using your percentage from Russia that's 40% of 34.5% oil-sourced energy, or about 13.8% of energy consumption as oil from Russia.
8644 2018-07-11 12:18:39 @realDonaldTrump desperately wants to show that he’s against Russia by picking a fight with Germany over its oil purchases. After threatening to impose tariffs on German cars, Trump would like Germany to buy US fossil fuel. Germany has a decarbonization plan. The U.S. doesn’t.
8645 2018-07-11 12:18:39 Why are we protecting our allies when they are buying natural gas, oil from Russia. They need to help carry the freight and this President is saying it and following up unlike other Presidents. Love Mr Trump. Go go go make them pay

8656 2018-07-11 12:17:52 We all know they supply gas/oil to Germany. But that does not mean that 60% of Germany's energy comes from Russia - Germany's energy mix for power production is about 40% coal, more than 30% renewables, less than 20% gas and 10% nuclear, according to Marex Spectron.

8670 2018-07-11 12:17:06 I never thought I’d see the day when I totally agree with Donny Trump. Germany relying on that amount of oil and gas from Russia...madness #bbcnews
8671 2018-07-11 12:17:04 Let me get this right, Germany is getting oil from a Russian company whose top guy just so happened to be a former German Chancellor. Yet the US is supposed to protect Germany from Russia by paying more than its fair share to NATO and Germany pays hardly nothing. Heck NO!
8672 2018-07-11 12:17:03 At NATO, NATO General trieed using a Hillary Clinton line to Trump saying "We are stronger together", lol! It didn't go well as Trump responded "How are we together if Germany is purchasing oil from Russia the very country they're seeking protection from"?
8673 2018-07-11 12:17:01 You ask questions like an oblivious 5 year old, then proceed to correct a guy when it's clear you have absolutely no idea what you're even saying. Watch the video?

8686 2018-07-11 12:15:59 @POTUS tells us, the people, what is really going on... Russia so bad we can't be talking 2 them but Germany buys oil from them since 2002 & NATO is suppose 2 defend Germany from Russia??  Scam!!  #Merkel & these Globalists taking advantage of the #AmericanPeople

8697 2018-07-11 12:15:04 And as a precursor to Trump meeting with Putin, Trump attacks Germany for buying natural gas from Russia. Putin has been trying to get sanctions lifted for Exxon Mobil and Russian oil for the biggest deal ever made for oil exploration in the Polar region, Obama opposed it.
8698 2018-07-11 12:15:02 Well Done @realDonaldTrump  for calling out #NATO! The Hypocrisy of @NATO! On one hand they want to make Russia as an the enemy! On the other hand they buy their oil! Not to mention they are #deadbeats... #FUCK NATO
8699 2018-07-11 12:14:55 It's their biggest export along with oil but less than 50% comes to Europe, what damage would be done to Europe if he turned the taps off? Don't think that was DT's point. Why plow cash into protection for Europe when they plow cash into who ur protecting them from? Got a point.

8709 2018-07-11 12:14:05 Just seen Trump on the news dissing Germany. He says Germany is run by Russia because the Germans have an oil deal with them. He and Putin are out to ‘get’ Merkel who is one of the most respected politicians in Europe.
8710 2018-07-11 12:14:01 Thank you, @guardian, this reminds me of those good old days in Tamil Nadu, when rasam was an unwritten must in our daily menu. However, @AlunSperring, you would need to check about the oil used. Coconut oil is a no-brainer for Tamil dishes. It's used abundantly in Kerala though.

8713 2018-07-11 12:13:36 Trump says #Germany is controlled by Russian oil and gas; I’ll take that anyway over being controlled by a Russian pee tape.
8714 2018-07-11 12:13:36 First, I’m not against NATO. But I do believe the “all for one, one for all” should be 2 sided. How often do we hear Putin is evil? Yet it’s ok to SUPPORT him by buying oil from him? Shouldn’t NATO allies support and do business with each other? That’s kind of the point right?
8715 2018-07-11 12:13:32 And he accused Germany of depending on Russia for most of it’s energy. How is this relevant in discussions about NATO? And aren’t we somewhat dependent on middle east oil? Last week, trump asked them to pump more to keep our pump prices down. Hypocrite!

8720 2018-07-11 12:13:03 It’s the same reason the US wants Regime Change in Iran and Syria. It’s called Global Economic Domination with Saudi Arabia at its side. They want to cut Russia’s Oil Game as much as possible everywhere, here especially EU.

8722 2018-07-11 12:12:59 @CNBC Germany is reliant on Russian gas and oil.  Who denies it?  Germany reduced defense spending after fall of wall.  Apparently, feared Russia less.  So where is the disconnect?  Germany is rich.  Pay up or shut up.  Diplomats are buddies with each other.
8723 2018-07-11 12:12:50 .@realDonaldTrump So is your position is that democracies shouldn’t buy energy from dictatorships? So will you ask Congress to ban oil imports to the U. S. from Saudi Arabia, UAE, etc?

8732 2018-07-11 12:12:15 I'm guessing you just learned Russia supplies Germany with oil from Trumps word vomit this morning.

8747 2018-07-11 12:11:32 Nope! Lipids are not soluble brother. They're made up of non polar molecules and water is a polar molecule hence cannot mix. Does oil dissolve in water? Basic science.
8748 2018-07-11 12:11:23 EU "allies" having it both ways - cheap oil from Russia whilst bilking American taxpayers - NATO obviously has morphed into a globalist tryst playing both sides which we might conclude is the Euro version of the 'Art of the Deal'

8753 2018-07-11 12:11:10 I think he’s projecting. People say he’s controlled by Russia so he flips it and says Germany is. He also doesn’t like clean energy. Plus, oil companies back here have big plans for shipping liquified natural gas, though the tech isn’t there quite yet.

8823 2018-07-11 12:05:33 @ghoshworld Germany should buy oil from the US not Russia

8825 2018-07-11 12:05:29 Germany buys oil from Russia then wants the US to pay for their protection from Russia.
8826 2018-07-11 12:05:28 @_ImperatorRex_ Russia can't afford to turn off spigot, oil is the only thing keeping its economy afloat.  #POTUS did the right thing by calling out European leaders who expect US to pay for defense and then give money to Russia #NATOReform
8827 2018-07-11 12:05:23 If you control a countries energy you control their economy.  Think 1979 OPEC Oil Embargo.   OPEC HURT THE US ECONOMY BADLY!
8828 2018-07-11 12:05:20 Some early signs of flattening of the oil forward curve Dec through Feb 19. Would like to see increased selling of front end and together with seasonality, slowing global PMI and some divergences it might be a good short #OOTT
8829 2018-07-11 12:05:17 European Council Pres and NATO Sec Gen Stoltenberg: “It is always worth knowing who is your strategic friend and who is your strategic problem."  US pays 70% of NATO to defend against Russia and Europe uses $ for oil pipeline from Russia,  So Russia is Europe's strategic friend.
8830 2018-07-11 12:05:07 I wonder if they will throw roses at their feet.  Just another American war another American fuck up in the name of oil!
8831 2018-07-11 12:05:05 We’re getting less oil from ME and we have other concerns there. Germany isn’t landlocked (North Sea).
8832 2018-07-11 12:05:04 We should pay the same % as the mighty Germany. What will the Mighty Germans concede when Vladimir Flopton  closes the oil tap, or maybe tge have already conceded the NATO budget!
8833 2018-07-11 12:04:57 Defending their land? Isn’t it our land. But Native Americans don’t count. Let the oil pollute their water. Who cares?
8834 2018-07-11 12:04:56 This whole thing, with Trump and Russia.... all of it, from @GOP takeover, to cabinet posts, to all Mueller is investigating; it is all about oil interests. That is, really, how far down the rabbit hole we've gone.
8835 2018-07-11 12:04:45 Well, first you don’t change your oil regularly...
8836 2018-07-11 12:04:41 Ask the EFTA countries how they feel. Granted as a Norwegian I may be better off but we have a ton of oil and fish with a very low citizen count. The UK is much more crowded. Chances are you will become much more of a colony now then when you had a say at the table :|
8837 2018-07-11 12:04:40 Why would we consider them allies if they are in a pipeline/oil deal with RUSSIA?!? Gotta pick something and stick with it guys. Either Putin is cool or not. If not then why is Germany allied with U.S.and doing business with Putin?
8838 2018-07-11 12:04:29 The elephant in room, unfair for decades, is use of $ for oil txns.  Remove unfair trade imbalances + unfair petrodollar standard. This is  all about energy after all, replace with bitcoin ;)

8849 2018-07-11 12:03:17 von der Leyen was saying on PBS @camanpour last night that the pipeline was begun I think in 2003, pre-Putin.  He has threatened to squeeeze or over-price that oil, but Germany is ahead with renewables, and can switch on Putin, leverage it off, right?
8850 2018-07-11 12:03:15 擬似マーリン戦法なかなか使える
8851 2018-07-11 12:03:13 Why did EU sign huge oil deal with Russia and we pay higher percentage of NATO bill? And former leader of Germany owns oil company.  You should do some homework, unless you like to lie.
8852 2018-07-11 12:03:09 We get oil from the Middle East.  Do we not have to defend from attacks from some of them?   Germany is landlocked.  It’s choices are quite limited.  We were at war with Iraq and Iran for years.  Same difference
8853 2018-07-11 12:03:03 What you suggesting is socialist in nature, sir!!! If Russia charges less for oil, why shouldn’t Germany buy from them?  Why do you hate capitalism? I mean really!!!
8854 2018-07-11 12:03:02 Germany buys a ton of Russian oil to keep their economy running...

8857 2018-07-11 12:02:45 His point is that they should buy oil from US.
8858 2018-07-11 12:02:44 While asking that, ask why they never question Trillions approved by Congress for the US military complex, subsidies for oil, pharma, tax breaks for corporations, etc., "How are we gonna pay for it?" Like they question how to pay for social services that help under privledged?
8859 2018-07-11 12:02:44 I forgot how clumsy I get when I’m tired. I spent more time cleaning the oil I spilled than cooking the egg.

8878 2018-07-11 12:01:13 There is no point in it, unless the point is to destabilise Europe further. Trump has flagrantly attacked the US's closest allies.

On the plus side Trump diminishing the US's influence might create more European unity so we don't go on any more middle eastern oil crusades.
8879 2018-07-11 12:01:11 Well.... it’s about as daft as the likes of tevez or Robinho joining city when they were a nothing club then. City and Chelsea are basically the same, 2 small clubs with success funded by oil money

8886 2018-07-11 12:00:14 So words mean more to you than actions.  Trump didn’t threaten Europe, he stated facts.  Germany doesn’t pay their share of NATO. Also, they’re building an oil pipeline to Russia, which means increasing Russia’s wealth.  But yeah Trump’s the bad guy.  Hatred makes you stupid.
8887 2018-07-11 12:00:12 Education should be free, becuase we will not be able to compete with other countries. Coal, oil and a myriad of other industries are obsolete.

Importing cost of Ethanol less than Crude Oil.

8929 2018-07-11 11:55:24 Is there no way Germany can cancel this Russian gas deal? Russia has not shown positivity to freedom of consciences and these big money is inability to truth. How can Germany do such a thing? You can't pay Putin such huge money to oil it's unbalance to humanity consciences.
8930 2018-07-11 11:55:22 NATO Trump claims “Germany is getting 60 to 70 per cent of their energy  from Russia and a new pipeline”.

8934 2018-07-11 11:55:18 Funny how Trump says Russia should be an ally, but Germany buying gas/oil from them means they are "controlled by Russia".
So, is Russia good or bad?

8938 2018-07-11 11:55:08 Global stock markets, oil, gold and currency prices are falling as a result of the US President threats of imposing trade charges on China, causing mounting trade tensions between the world's two largest economies.

9108 2018-07-11 11:41:19 I'm still wonder why it's ok to you guys that EVIL RUSSIA is still supplying even 1% of oil to Germany and many European nation? Isn't that like COLLUSION or something? Doesn't that make all these E.U nations open to RUSSIAN BLACKMAIL & RUSSIAN INFLUENCE   So Trumps right?

9145 2018-07-11 11:37:18 Germany's paying Russia billions of dollars for oil/gas supplies, so they're indirectly funding Russia's military. *US then pays to protect Germany from Russian military.

9148 2018-07-11 11:36:49 okay so maybe using coconut oil to fry my egg for lunch wasn't a bright idea. it doesn't taste awful, but it's slightly odd when your savoury egg (with a bit of salt and pepper and cheese) has a subtle coconut taste to it.
9149 2018-07-11 11:36:26 Trump is spouting Putin's dictation, and said Germany is being controlled by Russia due to the oil pipeline.
9150 2018-07-11 11:36:22 American taxpayers are paying billions to defend the EU against Russia.

EU is paying billions to Russia for oil + gas.

Perhaps Germany should pay billions to America for oil + gas, and stop extorting our workers for defense they apparently don’t feel they need.
9151 2018-07-11 11:35:58 Putin's plan is to run his oil & gas through Ukraine pipelines  for free. The only way to do it is by annexing them. He already has  troops in place in Eastern Ukraine  disguised as "freedom fighters". Now he has the complete backing of the #bigorangehead. #Puppet

9166 2018-07-11 11:34:03 Speaking even before the NATO summit began here, and amid domestic political turmoil for German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Trump said it is not fair to American taxpayers that Germany buys oil and gas from Russia while enjoying the umbrella of defense provided by U.S. dollars.
9167 2018-07-11 11:34:00 FakeTRUMP:,,"Folks, nobody knows it yet, but my criticizing Germany for its dependency on Russian oil was only a distracting move to camouflage my coming exit from the NATO and starting a military pact with my friend Putin instead!"..
9168 2018-07-11 11:33:57 So it’s ruthless and hatefull to say Germany pays and helped Russia by buying their oil in this process making Russia stronger and then not paying your part for your protection against the same people you are worried might attack you.
9169 2018-07-11 11:33:44 If it improves our schools! But we should start by taxing the oil companies.
9170 2018-07-11 11:33:21 Actually, he’s right about this schizophrenic politics, although the US practice it too, a small example would be buying oil from Venezuela and slamming them with a vicious blockade and trash talk on the side.

9213 2018-07-11 11:28:48 Mr. President, tell NATO either pay up or take a hike!   We can build a pipeline from US oil & gas to Europe from Alaska!  Tell Europe to buy our Farm Goods!  Friends support friends.  Is Europe really or friend???  (Follow the money?)
9214 2018-07-11 11:28:47 Germany recieves 70 percent of their oil and gas from Russia so he is not wrong
9215 2018-07-11 11:28:45 The whole house stinks of neem oil.
Horrible!
One of our dogs has a serious grass allergy, & it's a really good safe treatment for him. 
We gave him a neem oil sponge bath, & he's much less itchy and distressed now, bless him.
9216 2018-07-11 11:28:44 It is also not in raw form. By nature is a refined product. 
Technically speaking,the only truly“unrefined”coconut oil you can consume is the oil still inside the meat from a fresh coconut just picked off the tree
The least refined type is virgin coconut oil,& even that isn’t raw
9217 2018-07-11 11:28:39 Oil? Yikes. Obviously you haven't tasted Kalimpong pork momos or Dhulikhel buffalo ones (I think the fat comes from the animal itself, not from a plastic pouch bought in the bazzar).

9219 2018-07-11 11:28:38 Interesting given Trump's push for a pipeline for the Saudi's across America and at the same time he's begging OPEC to increase oil sales cause prices in the US are climbing.

9227 2018-07-11 11:28:04 Europe has been dependent on Russia oil a long time now an that fact you are trying to deny this is not only hilarious but very exposing.  Thanks for the comedy tho.
9228 2018-07-11 11:28:02 You’re not. A country that cared about resilience in the face of disaster would already be doing it. Just as we ought to keep far higher stocks of oil and gas than we do. Successive govts have been too stupid and too mean to see that.
9229 2018-07-11 11:28:00 By Germany (and others) paying Russia billions of dollars for oil supply aren't they indirectly funding Russia's military??

9232 2018-07-11 11:27:46 Seems like Trump is trying to get Germany to buy gas & oil from someone other than Russia. Maybe some of his friends & family are the ones he has in mind?
9233 2018-07-11 11:27:44 @realDonaldTrump  right to the point. Trump said: "If you look at it, Germany is a captive of Russia. They got rid of their coal plants, they got rid of their nuclear, they're getting so much of their oil and gas from Russia. I think it is something NATO has to look at."
9234 2018-07-11 11:27:44 Good job holding our Allies to being allies @POTUS !  I thought Putin was EVIL? Then why spend billions supporting him by buying his oil!? If you are a NATO ally then buy from a NATO ally!

9249 2018-07-11 11:26:26 He's right, but it's worse than that. Germany's paying Russia billions of dollars for their oil supply so is indirectly funding Russia's military.

9254 2018-07-11 11:25:37 Trump just exposed something 80% of America never knew.
That Russia exports oil and gas to Europe. 
It's almost as if Obama wanted this and at the same time wanted Putin's presence 
In the middle East for the first time in 40 yrs.
He also let Iran loose there too.
9255 2018-07-11 11:25:35 Really? I thought Putin was EVIL? Then why spend billions supporting him by buying his oil!? If you are a NATO ally then buy from a NATO ally!

9261 2018-07-11 11:24:55 They're an oil club. If they offer the most money they'll likely get them. If they won't they'll go elsewhere. That simple. You can bet Mahrez would have gone elsewhere had a top PL club been willing to pay him more.

9265 2018-07-11 11:24:41 Independent? Yeah right. Where does Germany get its oil and gas from? Where does it’s electricity come from? They are not independent and therefore are subject to manipulation.

9274 2018-07-11 11:23:38 Cause the USA imports itself oil and gas from Russia. 
10% of Exxon's oil is from Russia.

9276 2018-07-11 11:23:05 Then why does she claim to be our ally while spending billions on Russian oil? Why do people expect self sacrifice from the US but other countries support “evil” regimes? Put up or shut up Merkel.
9277 2018-07-11 11:22:59 Germany gets their oil from Russia: we got our PRESIDENT from Russia. #TreasonWeasel

9290 2018-07-11 11:21:30 @JoeNBC Europe is using up Putin’s oil reserves and his people will revolt when it is gone. Obama developed a plan to get US LNG to Europe when Putin manipulates the oil supply in winter and to provide a more stable energy supply to our allies in the long term.

9293 2018-07-11 11:21:22 Its what we need. Independence from other countries oil. God bless America!
9294 2018-07-11 11:21:03 If Germany does not pay their fair share in defense we should pull out of Germany. Why would we defend Germany from Russia when they are buying all their gas and oil from Russia. Answer that question Angula Merkel. POTUS better stick it to them, they need us, this is BS.

9299 2018-07-11 11:20:39 DT asks common sense questions like, "Why are you buying oil from Russia and then asking US to protect you from Russia?" This highlights the level of his intelligence and how he looks at things. Makes sense to me. @realDonaldTrump

9302 2018-07-11 11:20:11 I really loathe Trump but I think he makes a perfectly valid point here about energy security. Russia weaponized gas and oil supplies and Europe *is* heavily dependent on imported energy. We consume twice what we generate. It is a gaping hole in our security.

9315 2018-07-11 11:18:57 If you want to attack Russia without using troops, stop buying their energy. Their entire economy is built on oil and gas and Germany is supporting the Russian economy. Instead, they could buy American gas, which has been offered to them.
9316 2018-07-11 11:18:57 What a dumb statement. Germany just by buying Russian oil and gas is helping Russia get stronger.

9342 2018-07-11 11:15:40 Certainly makes sense that if Germany is comfortable enough with Russia to voluntarily get the majority of its oil from there and to not fully fund its obligations to protect itself from Russia, why are 32000 US troops in Germany to keep Russia at bay?

"In 2019, EIA forecasts that the United States will average nearly 12 million barrels of crude oil production per day ...If the forecast holds, that would make the U.S. the world’s leading producer of crude," passing Saudi Arabia.

9354 2018-07-11 11:14:29 trade can be but isn't always mutually beneficial. it's a prisoner's dilemma. if we expect them to be good and they are we both benefit. if they don't we suffer. the current economy can't do without oil while they can do without our products.

9356 2018-07-11 11:14:08 There is more than gas and oil in Scotland. Where I was born still has the worlds largest bus manufacturer and the largest cast iron sink/bath/toilet manufacturer in the EU. Not 'sexy' stuff but good little earners dependent on EU! This is the case across much of the country.

9363 2018-07-11 11:13:05 POTUS made a great point: Germany chooses to get the majority of its oil/gas from Russia (vs US for example) while the US spends a fortune to have our military in Germany to protect it from Russia. Huh?
9364 2018-07-11 11:13:03 What’s your problem? Germany expected us to continually pay more than our share to protect them from Russia as they buy 60% of their oil from Russia!? Buy American oil!!
9365 2018-07-11 11:12:58 Afraid I have to, no choice. I’m not saying it’s a good thing. I have to use soap too, but Indonesia is wiping out orangutan populations to produce palm oil, a major ingredient of soap and shampoos. If I could stop that too, I would.

9391 2018-07-11 11:10:23 the issue with trade is that we are dependent on them. so if we don't  destabilise the middle east they will be able to form a block and control  us instead. Best option would be to remove the dependency on oil but who wants that? not the military-industrial complex.

9396 2018-07-11 11:10:08 Sugar scrubs w/ milk is actually very good...just mix milk & sugar into a paste. Works pretty well but shouldn't be daily.

I think coconut oil (applied directly) darkens the skin.

Raw lime/lemon is very acidic...not good at all.

Instead of body cream,apply moisturizers w/ SPF.

9477 2018-07-11 11:01:25 .@SecPompeo @statedeptspox @HeatherNauert Shocking that Germany and Europe are paying Russia billions of dollars for oil and energy supply. Why haven't you guys made this public before??

9480 2018-07-11 11:01:00 Also, no oil makes you feel like shit.
9481 2018-07-11 11:00:57 Just read comments on ABC, where idiots go for their news, about Trump's handling of NATO And Germany buying their oil and gas from Russia. Trump owned them, and all them idiots could do was be ashamed of him.

9483 2018-07-11 11:00:44 @CPC_HQ Doesn't the American oil refineries buy our oil for 1 dollar a barrel and charge Canadians a ridiculous price for fuel, Not the Liberal Party , tell the truth . Concervative oil companies are who you should blame not Liberals.

9490 2018-07-11 10:59:32 Angela Merkel could easily counterpoint Whining Baby Trump's complaining about Germany buying Russian oil while being a member of NATO because Baby Trump supports Putin about Putin's attacks on all of NATO's free elections including America's...
9491 2018-07-11 10:59:28 Mr President perfect opportunity to tell these deadbeat countries to pay up their fair share of the NATO alliance budget & while you’re at it call Germany out for their business interests w/Russia (oil pipeline) going through Germany! We’re defending these losers? Not happening!
9492 2018-07-11 10:59:14 Ask him what he thinks about the fact that Germany and Europe are paying Russia billions of dollars for oil and energy supply??
9493 2018-07-11 10:59:02 That Russia sells oil to Germany? That's the collusion I'm talking about

9495 2018-07-11 10:58:51 @Morning_Joe @JoeNBC @jmeacham
#Trump's real goal in attacking Germany's oil deal w/ #Russia is giving cover to his impending attempt to involve the U.S. in partnerships w/ Putin.

Invite @sarahkendzior on to explain kleptocratic @realDonaldTrump's true motives. #NatoSummit

9501 2018-07-11 10:58:26 You got all wrong, EU pays & send their army to protect the US interest that's what Nato is all about & not the way around, check it out before putting oil on fire with your words, the best solution would be independent without Nato but with a EU kind of Nato without the US
9502 2018-07-11 10:58:19 He built the Keystone Pipeline as well. And it burst over a lake in South Dakota. But hey....got rid of those pesky regulations. Oil is pretty tasty.
9503 2018-07-11 10:58:19 Absolutely, but let’s quit acting like God won’t have you boiled in oil and left to die before that happens. It’s almost as if Johns reward for his service is that he finally gets to die.

How do you think the Israelis keep making sure ISIS gets its oil shipments from Turkey? Its all linked back to NATO.

9523 2018-07-11 10:55:53 This is not an ‘accusation’ by PRESIDENT Trump ( they try to demean by not referring to him as President) it is FACT, Germany gets 70 percent of their oil from RUSSIA

9527 2018-07-11 10:55:27 Look at some oil paints. 
Look at the price.

Seems somewhat ominous.
9528 2018-07-11 10:55:20 So no country within NATO is allowed to do international businesses deals for Oil/gas unless it’s with the US or their business partners? Not captive to Russia - maybe they are actually breaking down the barriers of the old Europe vs USSR Cold War US fear mongering strategies.
9529 2018-07-11 10:55:01 It this is about oil, it would follow that the US is completely controlled by Saudi Arabia. Germany is also on course to be much less dependent on fossil fuels than the US.

9538 2018-07-11 10:53:51 @JohnBerman can't sleep. I think Trump was saying Germany wasn't paying their share but is willing to give millions and millions to Russia for oil. That is what ticked him off or sets him off.

Obama blocks that. Russian economy and oil prices nosedive. Putin is broke and needs Trump's help. Weaken sanctions.

9555 2018-07-11 10:51:49 But do we all agree that for the long-term health of our land, air, and people, we are aiming to reduce our use of petroleum products? I hope all those oil companies are researching alternative fuels—that is the future we need to create.

9587 2018-07-11 10:47:35 Give it up. No one said that was untrue-though 45’s point of Germany being captive appears to be untrue (acc to German official their oil gas supply is well diversified). 3 weeks ago your boy threw starbursts at Merkel, insulted Canada, said Russia should be back in G8 ETC ETC

9589 2018-07-11 10:47:22 Russia economy based on oil. Germany buys majority oil from Russia. Russia is military threat to EU/Germany. @POTUS is logical
9590 2018-07-11 10:47:09 Urh, well if you will constantly buy nation state-tier weapons systems, shady financial derivatives and crude oil, this is what you get, Ben.

PS - You don’t happen to have a Main Battle Tank kicking about that I could borrow, do you?
9591 2018-07-11 10:47:08 At least we’re paying for our own defense.  But your point is taken.  There’s no reason for us to buy oil from Russia IF they’re our enemy.  If they aren’t, there’s no reason for a huge military presence in Europe.
9592 2018-07-11 10:46:57 ... that oil and coal are global ressources which won't last forever. Someday it will be over. Nobody knows if this will be in 20 years or in 50 years. What are we going to do then? Maybe asking the Europeans for their know-how in solar technology, because we didn't ...

9600 2018-07-11 10:46:00 The thing is, US industry (including icky US steel, oil, coal, and LNG) are vital to those efforts. The US can make it on its own and on the same token, our allies can't sneer at US industry and fund our enemies they demand we protect them from- it undermines our power.

They got rid of their coal plants, they got rid of their nuclear, they're getting so much of their oil and gas from Russia. I think it is something NATO has to look at."

9622 2018-07-11 10:42:40 The oil tanker from Kirkuk exploding in Rojhelat and injuring /killing locals is an unfortunate reminder of the betrayal last year, by jash/xoforosh desperate to keep their illegal dealings with Iran safe, helped along by the UK/BP and enabled by the US.
9623 2018-07-11 10:42:34 from looking at "leaf & oil"s website, it would appear that they are just a retailer of other peoples products, like the 'balcann' moisturiser you mentioned aren't a leaf & oil product, they are from a company called 'annabis'

9641 2018-07-11 10:40:17 It could be something simple. Check your oil level and if it's fine, don't panic. Just take it in to get checked soon. Any auto parts store - like AutoZone - will run a diagnostic check for free (if the car is new enough to do that)

9646 2018-07-11 10:39:42 If @realDonaldTrump wants #Germany to stop buying gas from #Russia, he should stop buying oil from the middle east! Supporting #dictatorships is okay I take it, as long as the #oil flows? #Hypocrisy
9647 2018-07-11 10:39:39 It’s too heavy a oil. It clogs your pores, especially for your face and in its raw form.

9650 2018-07-11 10:38:35 GERMANY wants NATO to protect them from Russia.  GERMANY trades with Russia  by buying billions of dollars of oil from Russia.  Thus, GERMANY is undermining NATO’s states goal.  CLEAR ENOUGH FOR YOU?!?!

9671 2018-07-11 10:35:27 PLEASE print the transcript of Trump's breakfast meeting where he rambles incoherently about Merkel, Germany. Russian oil and allies payments to NATO. The press is interpreting what he's saying & providing backstory. If you listen to him word-for-word he's incoherent.

9730 2018-07-11 10:25:39 Germany is controlled by Russia? Because of oil deals? Does that mean we are controlled by the Saudis because of our oil deals with them? Also it looks like Kelly wishes that water was vodka and the rest of them look like they can’t believe how unbelievably stupid he sounds.
9731 2018-07-11 10:25:35 Um because he want to help his boys in the US Oil & Gas Industry by exporting US Natural Gas to Europe? This ain’t complicated dude.

In your shoes, @realDonaldTrump, I’d be a lot nicer to Canada and Mexico.
9736 2018-07-11 10:24:59 Trump is standing up for me!  When Germany doesn't live up to its commitment that means I am paying for THEIR defense.  How about Germany buy oil and gas from the US.

Libs always like weak negotiation.
9737 2018-07-11 10:24:47 Why are we even allies with Germany fuck them they were and still are the Nazis we should have taken control of them so they can never govern again it’s madness. We are also paying to protect them from Russia who supply them with oil. Yea some ally they turned out to be.

9740 2018-07-11 10:24:06 The deal allowed them to build nuclear weapons after 10 years with our blessing.  The Europeans are terrified of the Iranians and also want to have access to their oil and other commercial deals.
9741 2018-07-11 10:24:05 It’s all fun and games till the FBI shows up, 

9742 2018-07-11 10:23:41 @POTUS calling out Germany buying Russian oil and expecting US to defend them from Russia.  Plus not paying their fair share for NATO.  

Love @POTUS speaking up for our country.  No more SUCKERS!  At NATO and with Trade.  Allies do not take advantage of us!!!
9743 2018-07-11 10:23:27 oh well Germany is buying oil from Putin - ok lets scrap all treaties that keep us safer since WW2 - by bye NATO by bye alliance - by by co operation for the last 70 years #trumpmatosummit

9748 2018-07-11 10:22:43 Culture & religion get twisted,the use of Isis the goddess of creation in the ancient texts,& because of certain religions holding all the power they get 2 slander Isis with a terrorist group that they helped create with their fail attempts 2 plunder oil & disrespect of Muslims
9749 2018-07-11 10:22:39 Will still write  Labour MPs as still think1 of main problems is not understanding the difference between medicinal and recreational use

then sells it abroad!!!

9754 2018-07-11 10:21:24 Before the prophet's widow used her gifts, she told Elisha that all she had was olive oil. 

He told her to pour it out! 

She listened to him!

As she poured it out, it multiplied! 

Our gifts grow when we use them for God's purpose.

9756 2018-07-11 10:21:04 Did someone see President Trump chiding the NATO Secretary General over defense spending budget contributions  and Germany oil business deal with Russia? This is arrant display of transparent dishonesty on the part of President Trump  who is wooing Russia from all angles.

9760 2018-07-11 10:20:06 No it’s basically just rich person gas lol. Like the difference between synthetic oil and regular. It’s better for your car, but who cares 
9761 2018-07-11 10:20:02 Now you prepare that Fetzer valve with some 3-in-1 oil and some gauze pads. And I'm gonna need 'bout ten quarts of anti-freeze, preferably Prestone. No, no make that Quaker State...

9783 2018-07-11 10:17:05 Could not agree more. So, do the US moves of slapping sanctions on Iran, pullling out of 2015 Iran Nucleur deal and asking countries to reduce its dependence on Iran for oil imports put you any better position? If so, then the US is backing you in its own sweet way.
9784 2018-07-11 10:16:55 1. Modi is politically correct he has to face the world especially IOC for cheaper oil. 2. These courts will never take off or be effective in the ground. On the contrary such acts will ensure more Hindu vote consolidation for BJP.

9801 2018-07-11 10:14:42 just tried oil. big mistake.
9802 2018-07-11 10:14:35 He's unhappy they want to give Russia money for a pipe line and not buy his expensive LNG. Russia have been supplying EU with gas / oil for years, why now?
9803 2018-07-11 10:14:28 Isn't that basically what Turkey did when they bought oil from isis.
9804 2018-07-11 10:14:25 Lol. Could be a game mechanic - trying to push hard grate one way will make you sweat oil, if you then push the box the other way, because floor is slippery, it's easier.
9805 2018-07-11 10:14:23 I mean I guess it’s possible but to be fair I don’t think Russia is prepared for war or wants it. War is mostly obsolete. trade has solved most of it the reasons you would go to war. Why would trump be telling Germany not to buy oil from Russia?
9806 2018-07-11 10:14:06 Baking, packaging, and transportation are all energy intensive. Perhaps they should use local oil paid for in Cornish tin coins?

9811 2018-07-11 10:13:31 Little history reality for @POTUS. US was completely reliant on Saudi oil for decades. Saudis comprised 15 of the 19 9-11 terrorists. @IvankaTrump  completely controlled by China. Trump Org profits controlled by Russian criminals. Whose "controlled" by whom?

9813 2018-07-11 10:13:30 It is the economic system. The people there voted to nationalize their North Sea oil reserves. That's what is fueling their  education, healthcare, infrastructure, etc.

9829 2018-07-11 10:10:52 Well @realDonaldTrump  , while you complain Germany is getting 80% of its oil and gas from Russia you didn't mention you are 100% in Putin's pocket. #MARINESagainstTrump #VetsAgainstTrump
9830 2018-07-11 10:10:49 Where? I don't see any sign of it. Other than to start blaming the oil companies. He said HE would lower gas prices. Why wasn't it his first job when it was the first thing he said in every speech?

9851 2018-07-11 10:06:49 Trump is so self-centred that he'll think it's flattery. Meanwhile he'll try to get Europe to pay more into NATO which he wants to be an extension of American influence into oil producing areas.

9857 2018-07-11 10:05:22 Trump is right, Germany shouldn't be buying more oil from Russia.

But what Trump ISN'T SAYING is that when he pulled America out of the Iran Deal AND implemented tariffs against Germany, he gave Merkel NO CHOICE but to secure the German ppl lives by buying more Russian oil.
9858 2018-07-11 10:05:15 Then don't just stop eating Nutella. Stop eating EVERYTHING with palm oil- it's small and difficult, but it's something YOU have control over and can do. At the very least it gives you a clear conscience.
9859 2018-07-11 10:05:14 Pure oil not diluted with compound to make it spray able
9860 2018-07-11 10:05:08 So you don't have any figures then and you cannot compare the oil extraction model to the UK oil extraction model.
9861 2018-07-11 10:04:51 It’s similar to moon cake. Thais call it Ka-Nom-Pia ขนมเปี๊ยะ. (Pia is from 餅 means rice-cakes or biscuits.)

It’s a kind of Chinese dessert with crust and filling. Crust is made from wheat flour, vegetable oil and egg. This one filling with Durian and salted yolk. ;)

9863 2018-07-11 10:04:41 Uhm ...  Germany runs on Russian oil.  They didnt cooperate w BO on some issues bc of that.  Let’s not let Trump hate deflect from a real issue in Gemany.  It hindered them on Crimea confrontation.
9864 2018-07-11 10:04:24 Proposing the EU breaks from Russian oil. He's definitely a Russian puppet.

9883 2018-07-11 10:01:16 ofの目的格用法、苦手な人が多いね。discovery of oil「石油の発見」、love of liberty「自由を愛すること」とか。みんなlove of a mother「母の愛」とかrise of the sun「日の出」みたいな主格用法は得意かも。

9885 2018-07-11 10:00:49 I really hope you learn more about how nato works vs what Trump spews out. I will agree on one thing Trump said, never thought I would say that, Europe needs to reduce it relliance on Russia’s oil/gas. Everything else he said was BS

9892 2018-07-11 09:59:43 #PresidentTrump making news from the #NATOSummit is Brussels. Says Germany getting most of it's oil and gas from Russia through a pipeline isn't fair. Says Russia controls Germany. #9news
9893 2018-07-11 09:59:36 Or palm oil. Consumers simply have no choice in any way that matters, because the bulk of palm oil (and essentially all unsustainably produced palm oil) is used by large convenience food corporations.

Yes, we can all stop eating Nutella, but that does not change *enough*.
9894 2018-07-11 09:59:27 Red oil!!!! ROFLOL
9895 2018-07-11 09:59:18 Dear @POTUS. You are fantastic. didnt hold back by let them know what you think Merkel that she's doing oil& gas deal w/ Russia while wanting US to protect Germany & Europe from Russia. Sec Nato couldnt even respond to you except keep repeating his pathetic talking point
9896 2018-07-11 09:58:53 That's amazing news! The cold pressed Marula oil is great for after sun care. My face can't survive without it atm. Have you tried the vitamin C powder?
9897 2018-07-11 09:58:49 Good morning by the way. Come on England!!!!!!!! Looking forward to visiting @WallaseyCC for the big game tonight. A few pints of @BeavertownBeer Neck Oil should do the trick. #ENGCRO
9898 2018-07-11 09:58:48 Former German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder is chairman of the board of Nord Stream AG and of Rosneft. German policy towards Iran, which has the largest combined gas & oil reserves, is also influenced by their over-dependency on Russian gas and oil, esp after Tapline closed in 2002
9899 2018-07-11 09:58:30 Then @realDonaldTrump let’s pull them out! Save us $$$ while we’re at it! I mean after all they’re safe w/ their migrants as well as their oil reliance on Russia! STOP kissing EU ass America, let’s back out and see how $$$ we save & how long before Russia pulls another Crimea
9900 2018-07-11 09:58:29 Yg aku baca sih 3-4 tetes aturannya kalo face oil. Kalo kelebihan nanti malah krn over jd berjerawat krn bnyk sisa oil yg ga nyerap. Tp tergantung muka juga kali yaa
9901 2018-07-11 09:58:26 Of course - these are urban poor in India who subsist on white rice and little else ("participants with higher intake of refined grains consumed less legumes, fruits and vegetables, tubers, visible fats and oils, sugars, dairy products, fish and seafoods, and nuts and oil seeds")
9902 2018-07-11 09:57:53 Not enough if comparisons are to be believed. The UK sector is paying companies to take the pesky oil. Meanwhile in Norway... do some research for yourself. UK sector has been criminally mismanaged. The main difference between Norway and Scotland is that they are independent.

9908 2018-07-11 09:56:50 Bro, I think u'r right. But I suggest you get over yourself with Aliko. He like many others, 'won ti je lo'  They came at an opportune moment that they may never repeat itself. And this is always my plea to the youths. Those days of import licenses and free oil blocks are gone!
9909 2018-07-11 09:56:43 Yhee "oil-field".....while yu are on that, have yu ever asked yoslef where do yu get this cheap oil from?..... Trump is an idiot "period"

9914 2018-07-11 09:56:03 In similar fashion Carnegie built US Steel and funded the entire public library system. Henry Flagler of Standard Oil founded Miami.
9915 2018-07-11 09:55:54 Try fish oil vitamins and omega3  sometimes it helps, but everyone is different, its going to be a trail and error, keep a diary
9916 2018-07-11 09:55:51 I'm was not talking about Carnegie. I don't know much about him. I was talking about Rocafellar and standard Oil and How he got Wealthy & growth to start with.

His aggressive rise was more akin to Jeff Bezos/Amazon & retail, not selective governmentpreneur/corruption of Dangote.
9917 2018-07-11 09:55:50 Almost everything in the world would improve if that happened. I’m dependent upon oil but I hate it and oil companies.

9921 2018-07-11 09:54:36 I always assumed conditioner and leave in conditioner have different consistency , leave in is usually meant for moisturizing purposes and with any moisturizing process you have to end it with a sealant(oil of choice) in order to lock in that moisture.
9922 2018-07-11 09:54:12 Mr. President, please keep oil prices under control. Our cost of living has been increasing.
9923 2018-07-11 09:53:54 It's a 1950's third world clockwork tin can dripping oil all over the road

9925 2018-07-11 09:53:50 @SteveMartinToGo Many years passed since I dropped the oil pan to a plastic model in the blue shag carpet under the table. As we were packing to leave my childhood home, I found it.
9926 2018-07-11 09:53:49 @AnilSinghviZEE US gives waiver TO India on Iran oil purchases @latha_venkatesh
9927 2018-07-11 09:53:41 #OPEC's July Monthly Oil Market Report will be issued at 1150 GMT (1250 London time, 1350 Vienna time) on Wednesday
9928 2018-07-11 09:53:37 Is USA India's boss? Modi should clear. Iran oil ban issue.
9929 2018-07-11 09:53:15 @abc730 the move by the govt against witness K and his lawyer is an act of sheer bastardry and spineless toadying to multi national oil companies. As someone warned off by Phillips petroleum in 2001 it comes as no surprise.
9930 2018-07-11 09:52:47 y is this wrong? Surely any country can decide who it wants to buy oil & gas from?  They are sovereign nations. I have no problem with Trump and his trade deals looking for fairer trade. That's just sane business dealings but y force this 
More Russia phobia
9931 2018-07-11 09:52:46 No thanks! I love Tybee and Cumberland and all in between. Offshore oil is not worth the cost, not in dollars, not in environmental impact, not in contribution to climate change. Invest in green energy instead. Leave my beautiful GA coast alone!

9933 2018-07-11 09:52:10 shower before swim and wet hair thoroughly and use a swimming hat - that stops quite so much chlorine soaking in, then use shampoo & conditioner as usual after swim and put moroccan oil into damp hair afterwards? it helps a bit!
9934 2018-07-11 09:52:03 He told NATO ,Germany is controlled by Russia, because they buy oil from Russia. ( as every European country does) How thick do you have to be to make such statement ,knowing in what position he , himself is . He will lie and manipulate everybody to hide his criminal behaviour.

3. NASA who just gave up on going further but still need billions of $

9941 2018-07-11 09:50:37 Trump is 100% correct on #NordStream2: “I think it’s very sad when Germany makes a massive oil and gas deal with Russia, when you’re supposed to be guarding against Russia and Germany goes out and pays billions and billions of dollars a year to Russia".
9942 2018-07-11 09:50:26 What a joke u r claiming Germany is owned by Russia oil and gas. We all know u r being played  and owned byPutin’s.  Germany has a very aggressive renewable energy program. Our democracy is being destroyed by your bullying tactics. Don the con

9947 2018-07-11 09:49:48 Hey Liberal, how's this for 'Russian propaganda', Trump blasts Germany and other NATO countries for not contributing their 2% GDP share AND striking oil deals with Russia?
Yeah, that Nord Stream 2 pipeline that would double the amount of gas Russia can send directly to Germany!

9952 2018-07-11 09:49:23 From what I read there, falling of oil price in the international market and the oil sabotage in the Niger Delta and the lack of political will to save when there was boom (pre PMB) led to recession. That doesn't answer the question of which policy drove us into recession

9954 2018-07-11 09:49:14 How about exposing Modi for what he is  Why GOI under Mohd Modi looting gold from temples and calling it monetisation which Khangress couldn't do? Why you promote Mohd Modi who sold indian oil rigs to Saudi Barbaria for 55 USD billion?  The list is endless...
9955 2018-07-11 09:49:01 So China will be forced to wean itself off US oil, at which point the war on Iran begins and oil process skyrocket, dealing the killing blow.
9956 2018-07-11 09:48:56 Maybe then the US ought to stop buying oil from the middle east and set an example for us here in the EU... But no, its perfectly alright to support dictatorships as long as the oil flows! #Hypocrisy
9957 2018-07-11 09:48:09 …@MSNBC …the Europeans want the US to be tough on Russia yet they move quick to buy Russian oil which is the life blood of Russian power…
9958 2018-07-11 09:48:06 This is nonsense. Drive to the conditions. You have no idea what is in those shadows. An animal, a broken down car, an oil leak, any number of hazards. If you are controlling 2 tonnes of metal in an area where you can't reliably see, slow right down.
9959 2018-07-11 09:47:34 Completely different. These materials are not consumed, they are recyclable. Coal/oil are consumed on use.
9960 2018-07-11 09:47:26 @abc730 The Oil field, if you look is on our continent, if it was over near New Guinea share with them, but not Timor or Indonesia, who invaded West Papua, on our Continent!
9961 2018-07-11 09:47:16 Venezuela was a basket case before Chavez. They allowed all industries apart from oil to decay and die, and when oil prices fell, they ran out of money. THEN Chavez took over.
9962 2018-07-11 09:47:11 If your hair has already turned to straw then either visit a hairdresser, or use a very nourishing conditioner once or twice a week, the kind you leave in for 5 minutes before washing out. Also a little argan oil through the ends when hair is wet or dry. Very good luck!
9963 2018-07-11 09:46:58 America under Trumps leadership is producing so much oil we have outstripped the ability to move it thanks to Obama's 8 years of being Warren Buffets sock puppet and fighting pipelines
9964 2018-07-11 09:46:55 @cnnbrk must suck to get it wrong again? NATO Sec Gen just agreed with President Trump that funding not fair. Germany keeps buying oil from Russia, not helping.
9965 2018-07-11 09:46:55 All this stupidity over Gas when we've had for years RF Frequency Resonance self sufficient Generators. Its like what Gerard Morin says 'We live in the land of STUPID' - or is it 2do with the Globalist's ? Oil Fields? Power Stations? - constant money flowing from the public
