0 2019-05-13 23:59:20 Individual 1=bullshit gaslighting hard don't forget tariff wars tanking world stocks or your own stock market, billion dollar stonecold LOSER,just keep gaslighting real thinking people might not notice, no EXONERATION for you no thank you.
1 2019-05-13 23:58:48 Well street is total fraud on the people. The market declines exponentially and never recovers at a comparable rate it declines. Most smart money knows Trumps going to turn this tariff issuse into a long range net gain, but all they need is an excuse to tank the stocks .
2 2019-05-13 23:58:42 Well it would negatively impact the stock market. Finding buyers means you’re depressing the price on the debt and thus the yield will go higher. When yield on debt goes higher stocks will fall.
3 2019-05-13 23:58:06 How's the economy affecting you? Stocks are up, great. That's not helping me. Clearly you're one big talking point. Waste of time. Keep regurgitating no collusion blah blah you're embarrassing yourself.
4 2019-05-13 23:58:03 Tell me why at school in English class I was doing a survey and one of the questions said something about stocks and bonds  @ykmarkofficial
5 2019-05-13 23:57:06 @jimcramer In the past you have mentioned buying deep in the money calls on good stocks that have come down. Is now the time to do that in BA and/or FDX?

7 2019-05-13 23:55:20 Tech stocks really getting pummelled. Time to hibernate.
8 2019-05-13 23:55:05 Everything is down right now but Cronos and Aurora are stocks I’ve bought low and sold high
9 2019-05-13 23:52:26 Err the trade war means *more* people paying *more* for *more* things, and yet stocks are going DOWN?! 

Am I the only sane one here? Or does the whole world know something I don’t lol. 

Anyway if everybody *doesn’t* sell stocks will stop falling. Peasy 
10 2019-05-13 23:52:09 The girl that help me with my stocks so damn ghetto man. She fye but money can’t buy you class fr.
11 2019-05-13 23:51:45 I checked my stocks and started punching the air like Cuba Gooding Jr.
12 2019-05-13 23:50:44 The worst part about going shopping is that every place also stocks other people. That's why Amazon is so great. I don't have to worry about people getting in my way, or wait for people at the checkout to get what I need.
13 2019-05-13 23:50:43 would you for example invest them into real estate and stocks (blue chips, etf, etc)?
14 2019-05-13 23:50:26 DumptRump is losing the tariff war as stocks tumble more than 600 points today.
15 2019-05-13 23:50:07 I don’t have a college degree but I will work for free if you can teach me how to make a living out of trading stocks and using other investment vehicles.
