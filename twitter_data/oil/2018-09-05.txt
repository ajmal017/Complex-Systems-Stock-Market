6 2018-09-05 23:59:13 As for CBD oil... I have some right now from CO. Problem is though that I’ve had my Rx meds changed so often in the last two years (4 heads of 1 department at the VA will cause that ) that I never wanted to start it and then be left wondering which was helping, CBD or Rx...
7 2018-09-05 23:59:04 I always mist everything with a bit of avocado oil! it makes everything crispier that way, 10/10 would recommend!

9 2018-09-05 23:58:58 Funny how a guy goes bankrupt four times and still flies his ‘own’ plane.  If you filed they’d take everything you have.  I have read all I need about him.  He’s nothing more than a snake oil salesman.
10 2018-09-05 23:58:36 Thanks. Now I have to watch the movie again

12 2018-09-05 23:58:34 What do you call college lubricant?

Term oil
13 2018-09-05 23:58:15 #scheerio, firstly we Canadians that have the intelligences, know that the #tarsands are some of the dirtiest forms of oil there is & only lucrative while oil prices are high, which means higher prices at the pump.. 
Why are you so #dumbtruckdumb??
14 2018-09-05 23:58:04 No. It would make better sense to use less oil. The technologies are there - we need a transition plan to get us off fossil fuels that contribute to climate change. Building a pipeline is going in the wrong direction.
15 2018-09-05 23:57:58 Its like a spicy chili oil thing its bless
16 2018-09-05 23:57:56 Do you add oil at all? It literally comes out crispy white instead of golden brown.
17 2018-09-05 23:57:52 Lol, nah. Most people that live in Alberta don’t work in the oil patch. The Trans Mountain decision sucks, but Kenney is making things up again.
18 2018-09-05 23:57:52 Don't let your hair get into your face while you sleep. The oil from your hair can cause acne.

47 2018-09-05 23:56:50 Yes, so much oil, that things are slipping away from him, including his job!
48 2018-09-05 23:56:34 All those wars to get cheap oil from the terrorists and now is out of control again. What a shame.
49 2018-09-05 23:56:31 Current chicken thighs recipe in my oven right now:
In large, shallow, enameled cast iron pan, melt 3/4 stick of butter, 1 tbsp bacon fat, and a couple swirls of light olive oil (light because I don't want the flavor of olive oil, and I need to raise the smoke point).
50 2018-09-05 23:56:26 My dad laughed when i asked him to pick me up from the dealership, because i didn’t want to wait for my oil changed. But. He picked up my baby from day care without question. I won’t complain

61 2018-09-05 23:55:00 Even when economic development evens out, the US will still be the fourth largest economy on Earth, and has incredible oil reserves, while future major nations such as India, China, and Indonesia do not have large oil reserves.

63 2018-09-05 23:54:23 Modi Govt. had inherited Rs 1.4 lakh crore unpaid bills of the oil companies during 2009-14. It paid back with interest of 70000 Cr. @INCIndia won't tell you this.
64 2018-09-05 23:53:38 It's more the ice on the road. They usually get the snow cleared pretty quick in places that get lots of it. Ice is harder to deal with. And we only have guard rails where the plunge after sliding off the road is certain death. Or there's an oil pipeline.

93 2018-09-05 23:49:13 @kevinpol3 So great watching you play Indy 11 at Lucas Oil!  Bonus walking in and hearing Number 3 Kevin Politz announced!   You had fans from the Cheshire hood cheering you on!

95 2018-09-05 23:48:43 Yeah. Putin loved it when trump bombed him in syria, put more sanctions, threw out more Russians, gave $ & weapons to Russia enemies and is actively trying to ruin Russia oil industry. Use ur brain please. Msm is distorting facts to sway public opinion. Research urself

109 2018-09-05 23:46:38 The money from oil sales would pay for social programs that many Canadians love and could also pay for green programs. Without this income a large amount would come out of taxpayers pockets.

112 2018-09-05 23:45:57 Substitute olive oil or Duck fat for the butter. It’s a very healthy fat & 2 jars on @amazon cost $30.00. A little goes a long way. Sorry you have health issues & don’t know how to “swap this for that”. #Chopped is good to watch & learn-
113 2018-09-05 23:45:44 tastes like olive oil and brandy
114 2018-09-05 23:45:41 I’d tend to agree. Probably why there’s so many gov’t funded clean energy innitiatives. Referring to Canadian oil as the cleanest + eco friendly isn’t a lie. Which I think is what the OP was referring to. Claiming it to be cleaner than renewables? Now that would be misinformation
115 2018-09-05 23:45:40 coconut oil masks are your best friend when it comes to moisture. avoid shampoo as much as possible (i literally wash my hair once or twice a month). to deal with wave, i honestly just blowdry it with a bit of wax after i shower and hope for the best.

119 2018-09-05 23:44:49 My car is literally my child lol like the thought of not driving my Jeep makes me sad.. like yesterday when my mom took her for an oil change or if I take my moms car to Tennessee makes me wanna cry 
120 2018-09-05 23:44:35 Thanks for helping to wreck the future of the Pacific Northwest natural lands and waters in the service of oil companies, Mr. Trudeau. We are all so impressed by your avid environmentalism over here.
121 2018-09-05 23:44:07 Can this #clown reveal how much did the #oil industry of #Alberta benefitted from the federal government subsidies while #Harper Government was in power? Instead of investing into alternative energy production, they kept stubbornly sticking to the 19th century fuel?
122 2018-09-05 23:44:06 @choiceaustralia have you ever considered comparing butter brands for quality & additives similar to recent discussions on Honey?  Butter varies hugely from brand to brand & softness clearly a variable due to oil content.  #pleaseconsider

146 2018-09-05 23:40:21 Alberta should immediately shut off the oil to BC, immediately end equalization participation immediately opt out of carbon plan and immediately begin preparation for separation referendum and or invite other provinces to participate in new confederation/Constitution consultation

153 2018-09-05 23:39:39 We bought some cheese, bread and a beer. Aside from that everything was growing on the land. We had a salad of tomatoes, rocket, onion, cucumber. We were sitting under the olive tree which provided some of the olives for the oil.
154 2018-09-05 23:39:37 Oil is over or else we are, either way were going to “transition”

156 2018-09-05 23:39:23 @AndrewScheer Our oil the best in the world where did U get UR geological degree so why does  oil sand product need to refined a number times more just to make it FLOW than ie Saudi oil

158 2018-09-05 23:39:01 The best thing we could do is impose at 30% tariff on Oil from Western Canada.
159 2018-09-05 23:38:58 Rubio didnt stand up to him, he tried to ignore him which is actually a good method of dealing with an attention vampire like scum bag jones. The way to stand up to him would be to say that his defamation case is the reason his snake oil empire will be shut down, not the dems
160 2018-09-05 23:38:43 Aw I hope you like it i used to recommend cetaphil for acne prone dry skin my skin is like a frying pan especially with humidity but this worked  trainings just taught us that creams and stuff like that make it worse but gels control the oil

173 2018-09-05 23:36:30 It’s just hydraulic fluid right? Throw some oil dry on it and call it a day. I can’t believe this is a news story. Everyone who has ever been a mechanic is laughing at this.

212 2018-09-05 23:32:58 Unfortunately the US govt, is a terrorist regime, thanks to CNN & all MSM. It paints its self as a prosperous righteous nation.. Syria, is a war for Syrian oil control, assad wanted to control his own industry the US don't agree. Iraq, Libya the same..
213 2018-09-05 23:32:55 I order mine dry most of the time, but occasionally with an oil & herb mixture.

223 2018-09-05 23:31:40 I really find it hard to believe that very many Americans actually believe anything these snake oil salesmen have to say. One would truly need to be illiterate & unable to grasp concept of common sense! 
224 2018-09-05 23:31:19 Misses the point entirely.  ALL NATIONS must move off oil. Canadians job is to get CANADA off oil. Chinese job to get China off oil. You see how that works?
225 2018-09-05 23:30:58 Does it have a defective oil pump?
226 2018-09-05 23:30:56 I told myself like 2 months ago that I’d finally go get my oil changed... still haven’t gone yikes

Any commercial oil off Nicaragua would have been discovered way before now.
Better check with Shell (non US) and many, many others that have tried for decades to find commercial oil there. Maybe Brazil. Easier in Nebraska buddy.

276 2018-09-05 23:23:49 Of course if you divide the load you’ll have to pay another driver and possibly a helper, add another truck, pay tolls and highway use taxes, registration, insurance gas, oil, diesel fluid, etc. cost of your kale: $50/lb.

279 2018-09-05 23:23:20 masking my hair in coconut oil every once in a while helps it so so much 
280 2018-09-05 23:23:16 Personally I’d negotiate. My main point would be to get a better price for our oil. In exchange for getting rid of SM. Then go from there. Also wouldn’t bring up social justice issues. We have zero right on telling them how to run their country
281 2018-09-05 23:23:07 Lucky numbers present God bless you get that guy Kuwait to lower the prices of oil so we can get gas down on the two bucks a gallon right before the election man good political move
282 2018-09-05 23:22:53 Took my car in to get an oil change. The power went out and my car is all the way up in the lift. 

So now I have a loaner car.
283 2018-09-05 23:22:53 a beginner's tip for using essential oils: do not use peppermint oil and then rub your eyes, it is NOT relaxing.

289 2018-09-05 23:22:10 We can actually tax exports to 1) build a best in world spill response system and 2) build a fund to accelerate green energy that Canadian companies who export oil  can use to fund green enrgy leadership.Just don’t get the government too involved.

That silent Sardar you are praising just happened add ghee to burning oil by the way he taxed fuel. Never forget that private planes took off to Malaysia to fill tank for daily operations as that was cheaper than filling fuel in India.
“Silent Sikh” is unpardonable
295 2018-09-05 23:21:46 How does she get away with this snake oil bullshit
296 2018-09-05 23:21:43 Just like i will defeat Hunkuyi in direct primaries.
297 2018-09-05 23:21:42 Ramen, but you take the noodles out after they’re cooked and put them in a pan with a little bit of oil and make them into a circle (looks like a donut) and then crack and egg or 2 in the middle and scramble them into the noodles and add siracha sauce. So good. Egg fried ramen.

301 2018-09-05 23:21:13 I'd pay to see #LauraLoomer vs #LindaSarsour in a @WWE "no holds barred" match
Naked

and body glitter 
oh yeah, whipped cream too
302 2018-09-05 23:21:01  This. Though in a regular pan you can drench the broccoli in a light coat of oil and stir constantly on medium-high to high heat until whatever tenderness you want it. add the mushrooms last, those don’t need as long to cook.
303 2018-09-05 23:21:00 this reminds me of all the consternation around big oil making crazy money but so many teachers unions were invested in them. now I'm sure you have police unions pensions owning NKE. I heart irony.

306 2018-09-05 23:20:55 He's going to pursue oil, not our will,our interest but his own...tell him to remember why he was elected?! For him to do the will of GOD ABOVE and will of AMERICAN people. Most are in dark but I see clearly.  Tell him to listen. It is not his country but all of OURS under God.
307 2018-09-05 23:20:55 Roasted with olive oil and orange zest, then drizzled with honey before serving.

314 2018-09-05 23:19:53 @realDonaldTrump A well oil machine!
315 2018-09-05 23:19:46 I know. I am referring to the conservatives who attack Canada and others for criticizing pipelines and big oil. Most Albertans are nice folks.
316 2018-09-05 23:19:37 girl, you gotta make the switch to coconut oil

320 2018-09-05 23:18:51 Only if it's sprinkled with olive oil
321 2018-09-05 23:18:48 You know you live in NY when you crack your oil pan 
322 2018-09-05 23:18:48 Recall BJP days when in opposition, it was crying for each rupee fall & oil price rise. Where is your that emergency like tone??

325 2018-09-05 23:18:36 That’s where another business idea comes in. Produce a face oil that gets it off when they want it off.
326 2018-09-05 23:18:31 While all that is going on(legal bullshit, consultations and studies) the construction should continue legal issues should only apply once oil starts to flow. Preparing for that eventuality is not prohibited.

331 2018-09-05 23:17:19 Norway seems to do ok? Is it possible to have an oil industry that is a major part of a nations GNP and still prosper?...I think it is possible.
332 2018-09-05 23:17:06 I was stalled and started replacing breakfast with bulletproof coffee 2 weeks ago and hit just made me more alert, I added the MCT oil and it fired me right back up into weight loss.

347 2018-09-05 23:15:53 "Research suggests that replacing some of the saturated fats we eat with unsaturated fats like avocado and olive oil, may reduce our risk of heart disease"

Bullshit. Saturated fat does NOT cause heart disease. Replacing? Stop vomiting cognitive dissonance through your fingers

356 2018-09-05 23:14:50 Anything fat free is a waste of time imo. Best mayo is made of olive oil, eggs as the base. Can’t beat homemade and Kraft products universally suck....
357 2018-09-05 23:14:25 The place to go for all the info on CBD oil and the many uses for it! This is the most amazing company and Annie really has amazing knowledge! If you want information just ask her!!
358 2018-09-05 23:14:25 Nice , but filling an empty space without your taste buds being refined like crude oil into petrol or jet fuel  , spice it up star .
359 2018-09-05 23:14:06 That are done well by Canadians and are trying to be torn down by outside money, which country in the world if having our oil resources would not have 2 pipelines to east and west . We are so gifted & bad influences are in charge of us fight back don’t give in

362 2018-09-05 23:13:42 I also made the mistake of getting a different kind of fish oil pills.
The last one was the same size as my multi, iron, and d3.

This new one?
They are 3x the size, or roughly as large as the other three combined. bleh. They're also a little stuck together. Too hot, I guess.

365 2018-09-05 23:12:43 What's your point? Did you read articles at NIH or just titles? Are you someone who was a stoner or knew a stoner in the past? It has nothing to do with medical cannabis today. CBD oil is taken orally. Stoners get stoned. Alcohol drinkers get drunk. It's what they do.
366 2018-09-05 23:12:41 Hey let's not give CBD oil a bad rep 
367 2018-09-05 23:12:29 Marijuana if you have access to it, otherwise just CBD oil or CBD cream

369 2018-09-05 23:12:02 False. And preventing oil sands development accomplished ZERO for global warming concerns.

372 2018-09-05 23:11:51 @cbcradio @CPC_HQ is actually correct about energy jobs Canadians will be missing out on. Unfortunately @AndrewScheer believes it’s in oil just like his predecessors told me 25yrs ago. Renewable energy jobs are Canada’s future. Too bad, so sad #KinderMorgan investors. #Cndpoli

384 2018-09-05 23:09:28 Funny how no matter who the leader is in the UK or the USA they sell our deadliest enemy weapons and make them own the richest oil company on the globe, yet everyone says they are different
385 2018-09-05 23:09:09 The only example to that is Venezuela. But they are truly communist. As to why their economy is so bad had to do with the fact of never diversifying their economy, relying heavily on oil

387 2018-09-05 23:08:57 Maybe doesn't count! Hearsay doesn't count! Non vetted doesn't count! So the only path left is FICTIONAL! A realm where nothing counts! We gained nothing from invasion of Iraq but Oil collected after they blew up 87 wells. So we traded oil for food after RED Grange putm out!
388 2018-09-05 23:08:56 Does getting an oil change really take an hour and a half? What the fuck. I had an appointment and I’m still waiting  I got shit to do.

400 2018-09-05 23:07:47 Then maybe the oil industry should have been more careful with their product, and clean up their mess better! It takes a lifetime to build trust, it takes seconds to destroy it. The COURTS stopped the project, the feds are on the hook and you know it jason! Hipocrit!

Recipe: Put the broccoli, peppers, mushrooms in pan with oil cook 5-6 min until vegetables are tender.

5-6 min? What magic is this??? Broccoli takes forever to cook, doesn't it?
403 2018-09-05 23:07:23 I don't think Janet was looking for a lasting relationship with Bobby. During that time, imo,  it was probably more about the pleasure (sexual)... I'm sure Bobby was fulfilling her needs. They may be oil and water but both are super freaky/sensual

410 2018-09-05 23:06:41 Look for Trudeau, family or members of cab to become consultants to Kinder if not employed. That's the oil business

412 2018-09-05 23:06:24 Yeah, selling off America to the Pharma companies, women's rights, oil companies and such.
413 2018-09-05 23:06:19 It’s as if Canada lost interest in Alberta... Is it our dirty oil? Is it because there’s sand in our petroleum? Is it because we have the Calgary Stampede and no one else?
414 2018-09-05 23:06:13 if we have oil and if there is a market for the oil, they'll come back. this political posturing is typical for big corp to do.

441 2018-09-05 23:03:10 This is why I left the Republican Party during Reagan! They aren't really for anything for the People!

445 2018-09-05 23:02:34 I rubbed coconut oil all over my arms and legs and I’m literally so soft I want to hug myself
446 2018-09-05 23:02:28 Snake-oil-salesmen get more pleasure (wrong word) from the sale (hoodwinking the punter) rather than from the profit?
447 2018-09-05 23:02:21 I make my daughter waffle fries in mine. I didn’t care for them but tested just putting a tablespoon of oil over them and they are actually pretty good that way
448 2018-09-05 23:02:21 NO PIPELINE WILL EVER BE BUILT UNDER A LIBERAL GOVT- PERIOD - Carbon Tax was implemented to make up revenue from the dead oilsands due to no pipeline.   Stop pretending a pipeline is possible under a Liberal mandate - it is NOT- Canada has lost 90 billion oil sales to China alone

Wash the potato, dry it, prick it with a fork a few times, put a bit of oil and salt on the outside if you want. Microwave it about 8 minutes. Open up and add fillings, butter etc

452 2018-09-05 23:01:52 Yep, I knew, just got half of the oil of the month with one of these rewards! Thanks!! #iloveplanttherapy
453 2018-09-05 23:01:52 I just bought a cool new iPad Man didn’t land on the moon--reptiles did! Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil! Drones are spying on me and my dad!
454 2018-09-05 23:01:49 This is FABULOUS!! As a married woman who mows her lawn, this is just as important as teaching your girls how to change a flat tire (and check the oil). I've had great luck with electric mowers as I find the gas powered mowers are a little heavy. They're also usually smaller.
455 2018-09-05 23:01:44 ☜Amazon
#Heavy, but this a a beast of a saw. Got an #amazing deal. Dont #forget to check oil #before starting.
456 2018-09-05 23:01:41 me, an idiot, puts on baby oil 2 mousturize after a shower and then immediately goes outside and walks 20 min in the heat!!!
457 2018-09-05 23:01:36 Mr Daisley is king of the assumption. Like who cares who invented haggis? He assumes we do. Anything to wind up those awful nats. He should do some real investigative journalism on what WM did with 40 odd years of oil revenue, for example.
458 2018-09-05 23:01:35 私本体は大丈夫！心配ありがと～～！！
459 2018-09-05 23:01:26 The capitalist billionaire siphon off the world's oil into their tankers, while millions have to burn manure for heat.
460 2018-09-05 23:01:03 The government of Iceland has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Eddie Murphy in a e-textiles wig.
461 2018-09-05 23:00:54 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
462 2018-09-05 23:00:52 All that oil and it was only a sensor I had to replace. Sheesh. Thank God.
463 2018-09-05 23:00:43 @CivGame Let’s make a deal! A fair deal. I’ll trade you 1 gold per turn and you give me jade, oranges, Stone, oil, uranium, and jeans, for 30 turns. Sound good? Great! (A joke I swear)
464 2018-09-05 23:00:42 but you have to crush the frozen oil then mix it with soy sauce and seasonings
465 2018-09-05 23:00:38 Given how devistated the Alberta oil and gas industry has been over the past few years and how badly pipelines been handled over the same time period this should come as a surprise to anyone. Like most Albertans I know people that are underemployed and even out of work since 2014

468 2018-09-05 22:59:35 No big secret I still cheer for the Red Wings (grew up a Wings fan) while simultaneously being an Oilers fan. The ONE game I cheer against the Oil is when they play Detroit. 
469 2018-09-05 22:59:28 Argan Oil is packed full of repairing and nurturing antioxidants for glowing skin! It’s in our #FrankincenseIntense Eye Cream!
470 2018-09-05 22:59:28 Look into CBD oil.....it helps calm the anxiety.
471 2018-09-05 22:59:22 If it was the 1940s and you read about how FDR refused to punish Texaco for selling oil to Spain in violation of our embargo, it would be the topic of one-third of your tweets
472 2018-09-05 22:59:08 As long as you fry your okra in bacon grease, I agree. Actually, I would think Sessions sounded stupid even if the whole world would roll its okra in Panko and fry it in rapeseed oil. (For you non-Southerners, that would be gastronomic heresy.)
473 2018-09-05 22:58:59 This pic is so cute. I bet it’s after he surprises her with the fixed bike. They hug and she gets oil on her face. And he wipes her face! That’s what I stand by! #Cin #Days
474 2018-09-05 22:58:51 Lol oh! What about oil dale area? My aunt just moved to some really nice houses by Christina. A 3 bed is 1,000 there so I’m assuming a 2 & 1 is even cheaper lol Incase you want ideas haha

478 2018-09-05 22:58:07 I'd recommend that u start with Venezuela. It has oil reserves that would have made it to one of the most successful countries in the world but after Nationalisation it is now one of the most poorest countries in the world. The irony is that they're literally sitting on money
479 2018-09-05 22:58:05 The same people that made the palm oil rule when they go to the village.
480 2018-09-05 22:58:05 Spent 900 on battery and tires for truck another 600 for alternator,oil change, and breaks on suv. Grand total 1500 bucks #ReasonWhy not going to the #fsu game #Saturday
481 2018-09-05 22:57:52 Pipeline will NEVER be built under Liberal Gov't - Liberal gov't killed the oilsands willfully and imposed Carbon Tax to make up for lost oil revenue/  REPORT THE TRUTH
482 2018-09-05 22:57:48 We need to start sending them back, bringing violence, no oil money and accents 
483 2018-09-05 22:57:45 Test coconut oil on a small part of your face first depending on your skin type it can break you out worse  I speak from experience also my skin is sensitive and oily in the t-zone. So basically a mess. But  for clear skin all around 
484 2018-09-05 22:57:19 Changing your own oil is so annoying 
485 2018-09-05 22:57:15 The garlic naan is really good, I like to toast it and dip it in garlicky olive oil
486 2018-09-05 22:57:03 When I die, embalm me in garlic and olive oil so that I smell friggin’ awesome when cremated.
487 2018-09-05 22:57:00 Nanny State will now have peoples consultation to consider a ban on Breast milk. Infant formula #sugartax already enacted: Only approved government reformulated brands available containing artificial sweeteners (#maltodextrin) & coconut oil.
#obesity. Ban It
488 2018-09-05 22:56:41 The answer is NO, NO 1000X NO. Your products lead to wildfires, rising temperatures, hot rivers killing fish, melting polar ice caps, droughts, failing crops, and ultimately the end of life on the planet. The oil patch must be wound down ASAP.
489 2018-09-05 22:56:33 NEVER buy a hard working guy buckle jeans because he will end up going into nasty creeks, ponds, under vehicles, anything you could think of, and get them all dirty with mud, oil, and all kinds of things. No point in spoiling him. #lessionlearned

493 2018-09-05 22:56:00 Using Castor oil on my face has almost made up for 5 years of smoking cigarettes
494 2018-09-05 22:55:42 Remember the time we tried to make something in the oven and no one took out the pans before turning it on and Savana burned her hand bc a pan still had some oil
495 2018-09-05 22:55:32 Tell me again how many tankers have spilled oil near Vancouver in the last 50 years.  Does your grandchild have a job in the real world or does she get paid by the taxpayers?

502 2018-09-05 22:54:14 Why would they help? they deal with the worst types n buy oil off em, bomb entire countries to sap all the oil, they will only help if they can get cheap oil and sell it to your family, friends n parents at an extortionate rate, it's a fact, entire world is corrupt now, fucked.

507 2018-09-05 22:53:41 Actually Kevin, Venezuela's over-reliance on oil and gas os a large source of social and economic strife. 

Moreover, I don't understand how promoting a diverse economy is a socialist objective...but hilarious joke all the same.

514 2018-09-05 22:52:59 Thank you. Neurologist upped one of her meds (Vimpat) and we see him next week. Asked him to consider Epidiolex (newly FDA approved CBD oil) as possible add on. He said he would which is miraculous for a CHOP physician. They are maddeningly conservative.
515 2018-09-05 22:52:50 who wants to take my car to get an oil change? cus i really don’t want to.

Heat olive oil...
Throw chopped onions
Throw salt
Throw pepper
Throw garlic

Let it caramelize

Then throw literally anything next to make food.

Beef?
Chicken?
Green beans? 
Tomatos??
MORE  onions??

All acceptable

522 2018-09-05 22:50:39 If that sonofabitch puts tariffs on Canadian cars, we should kill the deal that give the US oil under market rates.

526 2018-09-05 22:50:22 I used coconut oil to make some cookies today. I giggled to myself at how dangerous they are. Packed full of coconut oil, coconut flour and monk fruit. I will take my chances on coconut oil over canola oil any day!
527 2018-09-05 22:50:15 Granted I’m doing Whole30 so I had to buy some bougie things like coconut aminos and avocado oil, but still. It definitely made the $10 pizza look better!
528 2018-09-05 22:50:14 Ain’t a Puerto Rican restaurant in #Philly that can serve proper maduros. I should know better, but I like to keep the faith in ya. They just refuse to lower the oil from tostones levels and it’s 
529 2018-09-05 22:50:08 Whatever you have on hand: any oil, dry seasonings, sugar and salt, and some acid. OR, coat it like fried chicken and fry it (with or without marinade).
530 2018-09-05 22:49:55 The did not not finish spelling the designers it is "pamu oil"
531 2018-09-05 22:49:51 Is this why Canada and it's provinces are going bankrupt over green energy initiatives and tax payers are choosing between food and heating? 

This is not even including the complete destruction of our oil industry that has cost billions in economic revenue & our energy security.
532 2018-09-05 22:49:27 How wather and oil not work
533 2018-09-05 22:49:26 Women upset me when it comes to cars .. y’all might as well walk . Like your hair and nails your car needs maintaining too .. you can’t just drive and not get oil changes, brakes, rotors, keep your fluids up.. etc

550 2018-09-05 22:46:16 @arunjaitley @askGST_GoI what is stopping this gov. To bring oil prices under GST? Even states which are not under BJP rule,finance ministers are also ready. Then why are you pressurusing citizens just by giving silly reasons and putting all the blame on others.
551 2018-09-05 22:46:09 When cost of producing a barrel of crude remains relatively same compared to sharp drop in prices, a country which has made Oil its “economic game changer” is likely to face GH’s 2015 experience. Increasing production in “our” current setup, is only making way for another ‘2015’
552 2018-09-05 22:46:08 My hair was feeling pretty dry after I dyed it and I made a hair mask that made it feel so amazing! Avocado, raw honey and olive oil. Any curly girls or girls with dry hair should do this  Best mask ever

558 2018-09-05 22:44:57 @CNNAshleigh I wonder if the bed sheet found in the field, near the oil tanks, was thrown over the camera. He couldn’t take it when he left or else he would be seen on the footage.
559 2018-09-05 22:44:51 I was there for minutes shy of two hours.

They did find a couple of things wrong but the last half hour of that was waiting while they tried to figure out how to reset my car's computer so the tire pressure and oil life percentage showed the correct numbers.
560 2018-09-05 22:44:44 Duo launched an attack at Oil Man .
561 2018-09-05 22:44:39 They go hand in hand. Saudi oil is fine with you then? Thousands of tankers importing oil is much better than our own.
562 2018-09-05 22:44:33 all the ingredients for my hair growth oil are ORGANIC! none of that chemical shit will be put into my product
563 2018-09-05 22:44:25 Yeah it’s gonna be like a raw natural/essential oil. I get migraines and it eases my mind almost instantly
564 2018-09-05 22:44:16 How people can be so ignorant over little dumb shit like tire pressure or oil or ANYTHING about their car blows my mind

574 2018-09-05 22:42:22 He also said he would not compromise on climate change, indigenous rights and the environment.

Now we own a pipeline company and he's intent on making sure that tar sands oil reaches the Pacific.

So what he says and what he does are not the same.

Watch you backs, Canada.
575 2018-09-05 22:42:21 @FredGuttenberg I am sorry for your loss but what you described is NOT what happened. I saw a rerun of the interaction. You approached the Judge from behind. You SWATTED his arm sir. He never reached his hand out to you. With protests earlier, u should not have even touched him.

578 2018-09-05 22:41:38 I live in a city of 20,000 with some reasonably large organizations in and around it, yet nothing service related is open past like, 5:30. I don't think I've gotten this frustrated with something as simple as an oil change and brake job in my life...

580 2018-09-05 22:41:29 We’re talking about $4.5 billion taken from the working people and given to a transnational oil company Kinder Morgan while @JustinTrudeau knew the whole thing would fail. Folks we’ve all been had again.

584 2018-09-05 22:40:53 Inviting an oil oligarchs into the #WH is not going to reduce the price of oil! It’s YOU who has caused oil prices to increase with your sanctions on Iran!

586 2018-09-05 22:40:42 I feel sorry for South Carolina. Something has happened to @LindseyGrahamSC. He's turned into a snake oil salesman, but the snake oil he's peddling is Trump. Why, is he suddenly bowing to Trump? Trump is dangerous and we citizens are at risk. Those closest to Trump are saying it.
587 2018-09-05 22:40:41 Every time I go to get my oil changed or tires fixed or rotated or whatever I feel very judged by the guys doing it all the time yes I have no knowledge about cars leave me alone

607 2018-09-05 22:37:47 Yes Rachel, but what can ZV do to secure the highland population?

I believe you need a palm oil type campaign on native forest logging. Encouraging people to switch to 100% recycled paper products where available #SaveLeadie #threatenedspeciesday
608 2018-09-05 22:37:46 Then I don’t know :( maybe you can go to the doctor to ask for some tips but if you’re a healthy person maybe it depends on your body type  I’d say to cut sugary food or the ones that contain palm oil (? also it can be because of your metabolism !
609 2018-09-05 22:37:41 England's biggest export to Nigeria is refined petrol and diesel, most of it originates from Nigerian crude oil.

621 2018-09-05 22:35:29 Thanks big oil for taking advantage of a tropical@storm to raise gas prices ,20 a gallon.
622 2018-09-05 22:35:27 Frankly I hope they are making money to an extent, at least I can understand that. If trying to misrepresent @tesla for fun, well that would be downright evil and probably the wet dream of rich oil magnates.

632 2018-09-05 22:32:54 From what I've looked into, it seems like the legality of CBD oil in Wisconsin is still unclear/questionable, so I don't think that's going to be an option.

I've tried Melatonin before too (because its supposed to help with acid reflux), but I didn't find it helped much, sadly

681 2018-09-05 22:25:28 Did American sanctions force Venezuela to nationalize oil production, become over reliant on oil production and at the same time reduce oil production? Did American sanctions force Venezuela to increase domestic spending on social policies in an attempt to buy votes?
682 2018-09-05 22:25:18 This created a rare bidding war, where the various oil companies paid to ensure their competitor was going to be used.

687 2018-09-05 22:24:40 Never about oil.
688 2018-09-05 22:24:32 Or unless the entire thing (as we know) is staged to permit a war based on gas and oil prices and control of Syrian raw materials. That’s the aim.
689 2018-09-05 22:24:30 Too early to tell yet, I just started using it topically (via deodorant but I just rubbed some oil on) instead of a supplement. But the idea is to see if combining it with zinc in the evenings will help with some muscle soreness I’ve been having!
690 2018-09-05 22:24:20 You are a meme my dude.
>Dubai
Rich country because of the oil, it has such a large gdp per capita because they have tons of indians working there and living in shitty conditions but they don’t count as citizens.
>Saudi Arabia 
Portugal Gdp per capita is higher than SA even
691 2018-09-05 22:24:16 Don't leave Russia out of the equation. Without them, he wouldn't come near to winning if he gets that far, but Russia wants those sanctions removed and that big oil money. Putin is evil that way.

It doesn't work again. For the past one year oil has been between 8,500 - 9,500. Even OkomuOil Plc was hit. Bros try it not
701 2018-09-05 22:23:28 The oil belong to Venezuela, but private sector  was in chargue of the straction and commercialization of the oil. The government had to out the hands of it to use as a personal bank account .

709 2018-09-05 22:22:33 you dont feel anything from CBD oil strictly for therapeutic pain relief. HIGH dose CBD oils for example 20% CBD to 0.7THC you wont feel anything.. you need to try a 20% THC extract with low CBD content

714 2018-09-05 22:22:06 The reason I enjoyed processing it myself then was because I get to sell fresh oil unlike buying from someone else who have hoarded it for many months. Most get to smell horribly while some has this whitish content that settles beneath the oil. It's a good biz all the same.
715 2018-09-05 22:22:02 I wouldnt shake his hand either, man has no honor or morality.
716 2018-09-05 22:21:48 Yes, ALL the newspapers and news organizations are lying about you, EXCEPT for Feux News.  Seriously, even a snake oil salesman like you can't peddle that crap with a straight face, although the orange does hide the LIE lines.
717 2018-09-05 22:21:48 College money hack: Save money on oil changes by not getting them.
718 2018-09-05 22:21:40 In need of relaxation... candles, music, bubble bath and a nice oil down type of relaxation
719 2018-09-05 22:21:30 424 ga sih nder? Jadi 4 menit bersihin muka pake cleansing oil/face milk. Terus 2 menit pake sabun muka. Terus 4 menit cuci muka, 2 menit air anget, 2 menit air biasa. Mantul loh nder, cuman pegel aja tangan.
720 2018-09-05 22:21:29 What is Jones talking about?! Crazy man. So trying for some relevance where there is none, none buying his snake oil. He’s homeless. Pitiful man.
721 2018-09-05 22:21:29 @franktufan I'm developing an all GF-Beef, "Alpha Prey-Model Diet" recipe (30lb batch) for my new puppy and wanted your insight/opinion for the ratios "per 16 oz". Ingredients: muscle, heart, tripe, lung, ground bone, liver, kidney, fat, herring oil, and d-alpha tocopherol?
722 2018-09-05 22:21:26 So you will fly oil out of your landlocked country through whose airspace?
723 2018-09-05 22:21:17 Just out of interest, how many Asian workers die every year in the UAE while helping to construct oil refineries? How many deaths does it take to buy a trophy? #perspective
724 2018-09-05 22:21:03 Moscow State University expert said that the U.S and Russia could discuss relevant issues on oil and LNG markets without a third party“I assume that Russia agreed to give quotas for LNG sale in the European market,and in return the U.S. will support Russia’s oil and gas projects,
725 2018-09-05 22:20:42 Anyone else grease up with oil then put sweats on to protect your sheets? Basically you just create a full body moisturizing mask body suit, and then just sleep like that. But also on your back because you have a face mask on too?
726 2018-09-05 22:20:35 本当昨日の夜に自然災害は怖いって思ってたんだよ 

雨降ってないのに雷凄かったり怖かったんだよ

本当他人事じゃない
727 2018-09-05 22:20:17 I definitely paid my friend tho! I don’t cheat nobody. Full price. It’s an oil painting
728 2018-09-05 22:20:10 Why?? Let's just get out of their back yard and pay them for their oil or use the oil we claim we have here on Government land and have the proceeds go to health care for all, infrastructure,Education and first responders instead of letting the greedy corporations take it all..
729 2018-09-05 22:20:08 I’ll remember 9/11 next week...as the day I have 5 labs, prelabs, worksheets, and homeworks due. Might tell the US that my uni got oil so maybe they could end this
730 2018-09-05 22:20:04 In sept,oil price is up and foreign reserve is down,why?
731 2018-09-05 22:19:58 So either:
A) This is an unsubstantiated LARP, thereby making the NYT fake news

or

B) This is real, thereby justifying the claims of Deep State machinations and palace coup attempts
732 2018-09-05 22:19:51 is a shot or two of olive oil the cure to everything
733 2018-09-05 22:19:48 I think you got some crap CBD oil. Long time heavy THC fan and CBD won me over with 1 edible. No stress, no anxiety and no pain.
734 2018-09-05 22:19:43 ガスじゃねえんだよなあ
735 2018-09-05 22:19:15 I was talking about Dubai you retard, if Dubai didn’t have oil , do you think they would be as developed as they are now? Fuck no, they would be just like every other arab shithole
736 2018-09-05 22:19:06 Everything Started as a social democracy.Lots of social programs.Huge deficit, forced nationalization of the private sector ( oil, steel, iron).Big government. Corruption.
737 2018-09-05 22:18:59 Wow - our 2008 Passat recently had a main engine seal oil leak. The cost to remove the transmission and replace the seal was $1000.  I thought that was a lot. Jeez...
738 2018-09-05 22:18:58 No OIL, No LIFE!!!
739 2018-09-05 22:18:46 This chart is a good example of the role of speculators in oil price. Price began to rise immediately after cuts were announced, several months before global oil inventory actually started drawing down. Inventory remains a little on the high side, and I agree there's a bubble...
740 2018-09-05 22:18:34 Democracy and human rights dont matter when oil and money is involved
741 2018-09-05 22:18:14 I know you don't like BTC ;) But days like today (see of red), it's nice to know you can short it an make money. Maybe a bit like digital oil in times of recession?! (snowflakes can short too u know).. ;)
742 2018-09-05 22:17:46 I remember not having a phone for most of my childhood, and having to boil pots of water to get a bath because we often ran out of oil. So many things that I have now I appreciate SO MUCH because I never thought I'd ever have them.
743 2018-09-05 22:17:29 i was at the store and got one of those calming teas and lavender oil lmao my life
744 2018-09-05 22:17:25 Peanut oil and sunflower is the best shit to cook food with period!
745 2018-09-05 22:17:25 Oh yes, and tRump is an sane? Lol He’s a tiny little man who is arrogant and spends our money on the golf course, to the tune of $77 million as of this second. It’s ok for him to take from all programs and give to Big Oil and Tax Scams.  Hope you don’t need Your Social Security.
746 2018-09-05 22:17:03 I have thinking/saying this for years. Here in Canada we buy oil and sell them weapons. Multi billion dollar deals. Disgraceful
747 2018-09-05 22:16:54 It was never about babies, always about oil.
748 2018-09-05 22:16:47 Privatisation of Saudi oil, and sure of course that’s what the likes of FT and the Economist consider reform like 
749 2018-09-05 22:16:45 مثلا 
750 2018-09-05 22:16:35 I’m ready. I even put on bourbon vanilla oil today so i ain’t have to get ready. I STAY READY!!!
751 2018-09-05 22:16:20 If and when they get bad, I use steel wool and elbow grease, dish soap & warm water. Good as new!  I also store them with a very thin thin layer of any type of vegetable oil that I rub on. Keeps them from rusting and also helps with keeping them nonstick. :) Happy cleaning!
752 2018-09-05 22:16:20 Another option is coconut oil and styling gel
753 2018-09-05 22:16:07 387 wants an oil change *SQUAWK*
754 2018-09-05 22:16:03  corrupt as fuck cuntzcil er got nae chance unless ye minted  wi oil capital o Europe bit still got loads o poverty Google Aberdeen City council derz 9 suspended cuntzcillers bein investigated o noo
755 2018-09-05 22:15:58 Just check your dipstick and if it’s on low or below the safe line then add a little. If your oil is still up then you’ll be fine.
756 2018-09-05 22:15:50 and says oil dripping out his hands-all sweat u get from the lies man u get all pent up into babel kingdom of all confusion state-get with it church-get with Jesus all his truth-away from false fools silly gold at u-
757 2018-09-05 22:15:42 What's your favorite oil? #yleo
758 2018-09-05 22:15:24 @Janet4OH Hi Janet, I’ve just heard that Ohio is not letting CBD oil be sold. When law was passed I, and thousands of others, tried it for pain among other things. Some of us were able to eliminate opiods completely. Now we can’t purchase. What are your thoughts, what can you do?
759 2018-09-05 22:15:15 Vive la Avolution! Make the switch to @ChosenFoods 's cooking oils, spray, and spreads. Made from non-GMO avocado oil. PLUS save 50% when you spend more than $10 with code MOTHERRUNNER
760 2018-09-05 22:15:04 Been experimenting with magnesium oil
761 2018-09-05 22:15:02 My mom's dog lived CBD oil biscuits
762 2018-09-05 22:15:02 Okay and our strategic oil reserves that were meant as a buffer for these situations? Did Jouma Peterson really piss that away, or did she just pretend to take a tinkle?
763 2018-09-05 22:15:01 Never actually seen someone buy johnsons baby oil for their baby and why would you actually need to use baby oil on a baby? so confused
764 2018-09-05 22:15:00 There is an oil in everything / 
That's how the pop gets in
765 2018-09-05 22:14:56 It's so much more delicious in olive oil. There's no comparison! I don't see it in the stores very often so I just get it from Amazon.
766 2018-09-05 22:14:55 My vape taste like tanning oil!! Too much time at the beach!!
767 2018-09-05 22:14:50 You're a liar, snake oil salesman who shamelessly rips of the public who such a poor promoter you cant even land a single decent fighter with a "£1Billion war chest" or make the biggest fight in boxing at the moment. If thats the bar you set yourself you need to do better.
768 2018-09-05 22:14:49 Takes some effort but we found what they like. Daughter eats whatev, son eats carrots (cooked only), broccoli (stems only, won’t touch the ends), green beans roasted in olive oil & salt. He still complains, but he has no choice. A deal: he bitches less, he gets to eat less.
769 2018-09-05 22:14:38 i have nothing but kimchi in my fridge. i have udon noodles? i guess i could stir fry it i mean i have soy sauce and sesame oil and gochujang
770 2018-09-05 22:14:29 Alex Jones calls Rubio a [snake]. #irony from the snake oil peddling (literally he sells diet pills on his site), conspiracy theory concocting, fear mongerer. #snakeoil
771 2018-09-05 22:14:10 Honestly? Coffee scrubs>>> ... You want soft skin? Hit your entire body with a coffee scrub, pat dry then hit that bad boy with some oil. WHOOOWEEEE Skin like a babies bottom
772 2018-09-05 22:14:06 Aha but I remember some kind of ice building there. A hotel or something because with all those oil bucks they just keep doing ridiculous stuff. Maybe I’m wrong. Maybe just a rink.
773 2018-09-05 22:14:02 My parents raised me to be independent and to think critically. I would never fall for a snake oil salesman.
774 2018-09-05 22:13:59 lmaoooo any skin cleanser tbh, then witch hazel for a toner, and then bio oil as a moisturizer
775 2018-09-05 22:13:58 Valerie I couldn’t agree with you more about this. My family has been very badly affected by Justin Trudeau’s unDemocratic Virtue Signaling Government. I’m a 55 year old Oil Patch Brat. I can’t believe the Damage Justin Trudeau’s does domestically & internationally to Canada.
776 2018-09-05 22:13:57 Have we already discussed how Kamla suggested that Trinidad be given preference to refine it’s “caricom sister” (Guyana’s) Oil?
777 2018-09-05 22:13:56 Aww bless ya my entire house smells of olbas oil because my hubby has got it  I know it's gonna get me to 
778 2018-09-05 22:13:49 throw the slave woman out america. ishmael time 2go. passover.  exodus, the slave master.  delivered, Gods ppl.  prepare.  get oil for ur lamps.  electricity is not free. sprinkle the blood of the Lamb on the doorways of ur hearts. don't wait for the bread 2rise. feast now.
779 2018-09-05 22:13:12 Argon oil in the making
780 2018-09-05 22:13:05 Nah. I use polyunsaturated motor oil. Safe for cars AND arteries!
781 2018-09-05 22:13:00 RETWEET to show your support for Texas oil and gas development and the opportunities it provides to hundreds of thousands of Americans!
782 2018-09-05 22:12:44 Tell him it’s time to impose heaven duty on foreign oil that have lower enviro  standards than Alberta.  Promote and find invesstors for Energy East.  Appeal TM pipeline decision.
783 2018-09-05 22:12:39 Kavanaugh doesn't know who you are, he never hsd a hand out to pull back and after the way he and his family were treated, I wouldn't be shaking hands with random strangers either. You are trash.
784 2018-09-05 22:12:32 Spilled like a quarter cup of oil on the hot exhaust manifold of the SHO at a busy gas station, HOO BOY that was a lot of smoke
785 2018-09-05 22:12:13 >Dubai
Lol, if my country was also full of oil it would be rich
786 2018-09-05 22:12:08 I use coconut oil & moroccan oil treatment. 
I wash my hair, I brush it then I rub coconut oil on my scalp down to the ends then I use a bit of moroccan oil on top. Also avoid any shampoo/conditioner with sulfate. Sulfate is extremely damaging to hair so look at the ingredients.
787 2018-09-05 22:12:03 Every time I take my car to get an oil change, I’m scared they’re gonna tell me I have 101 things wrong with it that need to be fixed 
788 2018-09-05 22:11:56 True love is my dad replacing my brakes, wipers, and oil without me asking.
789 2018-09-05 22:11:50 "sprouting oil"

Reeeeeee.... Pissing...
790 2018-09-05 22:11:50 The second Gulf War was an attempt for greedy oil-men to take the Iraqi oil
The rise of more evil out of the previous evil regime has continuing consequences in thw Middle East & more widely
791 2018-09-05 22:11:37 I’m sure they’ve banned coconut oil? 
I need to google this but a friend told me it’s off the shelves in England because people are using it to make healing hemp liquid or something?
792 2018-09-05 22:11:37 Ive not taken it yet, but about to shortly. Had 4 drops of CBD oil earlier to see if it done anything without other meds kicking in and me not being able to tell. The Quetiapine didnt knock me out last night as id hoped but i did sleep a wee bit better than i usually do x
793 2018-09-05 22:11:19 Melt coconut oil and mix it with vitamin E oil and leave it in your hair for half an hour or more for a hair mask! Also for day to day i use Maui oil and not your mothers sea salt spray and it keeps my hair manageable!
794 2018-09-05 22:11:19 The Saudis and OPEC were putting the screws to us over our support of Israel.  Kissinger went to SA and gave them an offer they couldn’t refuse. Only use dollars for all oil transactions in return we will protect you and keep you in power.  This created the petro dollar system.
795 2018-09-05 22:11:12 To think that this man is a rich man with Investments in oil and gas! ... Smh
If this is true, it is such a shame.
796 2018-09-05 22:11:10 Pho is the drained noodles, nuts, cornflakes, and then disregard this is usually wheat flour, palm oil, and chop and instant
797 2018-09-05 22:10:49 Never put / get tea tree oil in your eat.
798 2018-09-05 22:10:44 This complicates their plans to replace the US dollar in their oil sales.
799 2018-09-05 22:10:33 Even without servicing?
U v exceeded ur service limit, ur engine oil, oil filter,  oil seal n injector nuzzles are blocked, pls service is recommended.
Thanks
800 2018-09-05 22:10:20 エルザー　何怒ってんだよー？
801 2018-09-05 22:10:16 はあ？午後から断水ってマジで言ってんの？
802 2018-09-05 22:10:10 I'm sure it was, Mr. Kiss the Ass of the Oil People.
803 2018-09-05 22:10:10 RT @LivingSafely: Cool #Whip this September? Its first three #ingredients are water, hydrogenated oil and High Fructose Corn Syrup!
804 2018-09-05 22:10:05 え、エクストラヴァージンオリーブオイルなのに飲みすぎると体に悪いんですか？
805 2018-09-05 22:10:01 You have 20 followers. This is a bot. An oil and gas bot. Don’t feed the trolls.
806 2018-09-05 22:10:01 After a scrub , oil and lotion shower session >>>
807 2018-09-05 22:09:58 Federal reserve- go ahead & make a interest rate hike... Then be advised not to raise no more for quite awhile... We will have a correction in Market, fueled by oil prices dropping...Last one for the year.  Thinking early next year is when correction hits... Work accordingly...
808 2018-09-05 22:09:41 Actually, the oil sands have reduced their emissions to the point that they meet the NA average.
809 2018-09-05 22:09:35 I thought it was reported that oil was only 69 dollars a barrel last night. I may be mistaken there, but I thought that's what was reported on one station.
810 2018-09-05 22:09:07 The worst is when ur cooking n hot oil pops on you
811 2018-09-05 22:09:01 I need an oil change like asap, can anyone help
812 2018-09-05 22:08:47 まーた揺れてんな
813 2018-09-05 22:08:40 It stops my nieces seizures. Before she was on CBD oil she was having 5-10 seizures per day. She hasn't had one in 4 months.
814 2018-09-05 22:08:20 Bounce on a ball. Pump your boobs. Have sex/orgasms. Do lunges and stretches. Putting castor oil in root beer or something. Spicy foods. The list goes on. I didn’t try any of it cuz I knew it wouldn’t work lmao.
815 2018-09-05 22:08:05 Oil just popped in my eye & I thought I turned the heat off on the rice & it was on high & now the rice is burned. I fucking hate my life :))
816 2018-09-05 22:08:02 It is shocking to read such misinformation and falsehood here . Nigeria crude oil output over the last one year has averaged 2M barrels per day.  So I don't know from where  you contrived the 1.5-1.6m barrels per day falsehood.  Pls do some little Desk top research
817 2018-09-05 22:07:54 What gave me away? Was it my wires or the fact that I love to down a can of oil with my lunch?
818 2018-09-05 22:07:30 Snake oil saleswoman.. rile up the base!
819 2018-09-05 22:07:29 冬じゃないだけマシだとおもってるけどでもきつい はらへった 冷たい飯食いたくねえ
820 2018-09-05 22:07:15 Yeah. The CBD oil is great! You can get it dropper bottle.
821 2018-09-05 22:07:12 A bit like Scotland’s ability to self fund with oil revenue ?
822 2018-09-05 22:07:05 Come on doc. Vegetarians, Vegans, LCHF, Keto-ers and even Meat eaters know coconut oil is not bad for you- tough on different sides of the fence.
How can you get this so wrong? Unless there's perhaps  a vested interest with veggie oil producers?
823 2018-09-05 22:06:59 Yea its the oil life. I have plenty of oil. Just my first time with a car with sensors that yells at me for service. Lol
824 2018-09-05 22:06:58 これだからオール電化は……停電キッツいな
825 2018-09-05 22:06:56 The mechanic asked if I wanted "the same oil as usual?" And I just said yes like I knew what oil I usually get  fake it till you make it 
826 2018-09-05 22:06:45 Do you live in OH & use CBD Oil for Medical Reasons? You might want to stock up on your supplies. The State is playing politics again, Ordered sales stopped. The Board Of Pharmacy is claiming that it’s illegal tho it’s made from Hemp NOT Weed. Way to go OH!
827 2018-09-05 22:06:42 店死んでるしなにもできなくね？
828 2018-09-05 22:06:41 Totally winging it but I think this vinaigrette should be olive oil, dijon and lemon juice. Oooh and capers should be involved.
829 2018-09-05 22:06:41 News flash: CBD oil is bullshit
830 2018-09-05 22:06:37 You are very right. Honestly I have access to the business but didn't tap it's potential. I once did it by buying the bunches of nuts, process and sell the palm oil. But now I focused more on planting of Cocoa and Plantain. This tweet of your redirect my focus. I'll give it a try
831 2018-09-05 22:06:13 Kuwait..Bushes oil Wells..
Yeah I recall..Shame on Bush..!!
832 2018-09-05 22:06:09 I like them, especially the oil painting
833 2018-09-05 22:06:08 OK, smarties. What's the ideal flavor compliment to a chili-infused oil?
834 2018-09-05 22:06:08 EZ shares -1.3%, US shares -0.3% as EM rout continues (EM shares -1.8% and down 19.7% from Jan high) and tech stocks under pressure (Nasdaq -1.2%).
US 10 yr yld flat at 2.9%.
Oil -1.6%, gold +0.4%, iron ore +0.3%.
ASX futures -0.4%.
$A 0.7192 as $US index -0.2%.
835 2018-09-05 22:06:01 Apparently, simply by using the phrase; "In the national interest" oil barons can bomb whichever country they like.
836 2018-09-05 22:05:54 Yeah, I understand, it has helped alot of people to cut out gluten. I also understand that CBD oil has helped many. I'm not saying anyone is wrong for doing those things, it just gets frustrating to keep getting suggestions hurled at me from friends and family- who do mean well-
837 2018-09-05 22:05:51 Loooool maybe be smarter than ghost and do an oil business instead of drugs
838 2018-09-05 22:05:35 @HondaCustSvc I have a 2014 Accord with excessive oil consumption and Honda’s horrible service doesn’t want to take care of the issue.
839 2018-09-05 22:05:21 I left some coconut oil in my 97degree car. Will that be warm enough for a hot oil treatment????
840 2018-09-05 22:05:19 Thanks so much. I gave him a couple of meal worms dipped in olive oil and soaked him for about 4 minutes, and he's good and pissed off now lol. Hopefully he'll poop!
841 2018-09-05 22:04:50 I'm looking for bae

846 2018-09-05 22:04:01 Especially oil!
847 2018-09-05 22:03:46 *looks at her bottles of baby oil and lube*
I'd pour one out, but then I'd be afraid of slipping. :(
848 2018-09-05 22:03:38 Avocado (oil) and coconut oil for your fats! Garbanzo beans, lentils, hemp seeds for protein!! Since you don’t eat dairy/meat, nutritional yeast is great for supplementing vit B12
849 2018-09-05 22:03:30 Dont even try this... you will cry. There's importation of palm oil from Malay whenever scarcity is imminent. In the past one year, end of the year or not, price has generally steadied. And once the oil gets stored it usually clods together. If you save 10 kegs, you get 9 later.
850 2018-09-05 22:03:14 This hemp oil...
851 2018-09-05 22:03:02 It's good. It would be the same as using hemp oil as cooking oil, or drinking hemp milk. It has that taste in it, but it's good. You're right about Italian dishes because the taste of marijuana is herbal, like basil and would combine well with tomato sauce.
852 2018-09-05 22:03:00 Not Year over year change.  Oil was 100 in 2014. In 2018 it’s $68.  That’s deflationary.
853 2018-09-05 22:02:56 Oh right you and @JustinTrudeau had more discussions about how to shut down  Alberta oil patch. @jkenney you listening to this garbage.

863 2018-09-05 22:01:27 It's an oil or?
864 2018-09-05 22:01:25 Minus the oil.
865 2018-09-05 22:01:22 Economic, Westminster has robbed 1 Trillion from Scotland's Oil revenue. That's 200,000 from each person in Scotland.

Social, Westminster brought us foodbanks

872 2018-09-05 22:00:26 crude oil price from 2011-13 was in range of $105-110, currently it's $65-70 per barrel, you can clearly see where the subsidy was used
873 2018-09-05 22:00:21 Because it would let us murder millions of people and steal the country's oil.
874 2018-09-05 22:00:11 YES it looks like an old oil painting so AESTHETIC but also goes with my theme of them emotionally breaking down and putting the pieces of each other back together 
875 2018-09-05 22:00:04 People LOVE oil dude.

882 2018-09-05 21:59:21  at least you learned you needed oil
883 2018-09-05 21:59:06 why does almost every Asian dish need to contain mad amounts of oil ffs
884 2018-09-05 21:58:50 bio oil ja stosuje czy jakos tak?? moge ci wyslac zdj jutro ale rzeczywiscie jest lepiej
885 2018-09-05 21:58:45 My car broke down and I just wasted 35$ to get coolant and 3 quarts of oil
886 2018-09-05 21:58:38 Paris Dennard here.  The only anonymous statements rom me are the soft, subtle sexwaves emitted by my glands that waft through the wilderness, tempting the honeyhoneypots to  boil the boogie oil.  Damn.
887 2018-09-05 21:58:34 There are two types of economists. 
The first one understands what is going on and bullshits.
The other just bullshits.
They are the modern day 21stC snake oil salesmen #Newsnight
888 2018-09-05 21:58:32 No driving(no gas profits) no work 24hrs(sales slump) and sell off coal/oil/gas stocks. Could make'em listen?
889 2018-09-05 21:58:32 Oil change time.

891 2018-09-05 21:58:27 next year my fbb team name is for sure going to be Coconut Oil Salesman. 100%
892 2018-09-05 21:58:19 Other options include: giving up the 8.4% ROE; selling excess power; using some Nalcor profits. And let's not forget the goal - a renewable future. Oil may be gone someday but water fuelled Muskrat and Upper Churchill (2041) assets will be ours forever.
893 2018-09-05 21:57:44 I use organic Argan oil on the ends and Aussie leave in conditioner all over
894 2018-09-05 21:57:29 Also expose the oil bond that your govt purchased. You always want the next govt pay for the bad deeds of congress
895 2018-09-05 21:57:26 Dump NAFTA. 75% of oil sold to US. Frick  let them put ketchup in their cars. Canada needs our own oil and N. gas
896 2018-09-05 21:57:15 Dispensary CBD, yes.  Snake oil, unregulated CBD, no. I'm a huge cannabis advocate.  Without RSO I'm basically catatonic.  If it does not contain THC, it's Omega 3.
897 2018-09-05 21:57:02 Getting my oil changed and toes done tomorrow and I’m sure granny Has something for Me to do.
898 2018-09-05 21:56:52 Mechanic stuffs. Grease, oil, that sort of thing.
899 2018-09-05 21:56:35 @PepsiCo @Nestle @Pizza Hut & @TacoBell spend millions on their ‘ethical’ image & say they only use RSPO-certified #palmoil. But truth is @RSPOtweets gives the OK to destructive palm oil by brand @Indofood #savetheorangutans
900 2018-09-05 21:56:19 Not gonna happen in the people's republic of the Bay Area
901 2018-09-05 21:55:59 yung clinic niyong mamamatay ka na pero efficasent oil parin ang binigay
902 2018-09-05 21:55:57 My Niggas is mad backwards. I started off smokin wax, then oil , then a few moonrock prerolls and then joints. Smh the disrespect
903 2018-09-05 21:55:50 just oil and vinegar lol what kinda sub you get btw would make sense
904 2018-09-05 21:55:41 Just blatantly lying.
On our public FM radio.
Their website is also running an ad called “truth about prop 2” stating the same thing. Even though we’re the only state to ONLY legalize CBD oil. 
That has to be how they’re getting away with their claim. 
Thought lying was a sin? 
905 2018-09-05 21:55:37 Every so often I put coconut oil in my hair
906 2018-09-05 21:55:33 Hahaha, not until you mentioned it. 

I do think of Naked Gun every time I'm in the bathroom and someone seems like they have a never ending stream going on though lol

908 2018-09-05 21:55:18 Idk.. Apart from bridge, breakdown of an oil feeder(for air crafts), drainage system, flooded machine for example which carries luggage to the outside and flooded substation located in the basement, breakdown of airport vehicles also make airport more difficult to reopen asap.
909 2018-09-05 21:55:04 If guys my age would not call me “dear” while I get my oil changed that would be great
910 2018-09-05 21:55:00 Balance sheet was much worse 12-8 months ago and stock was close to $15...don’t just rely on financials you have to look at macros as well (Brazil politics, rates, oil prices & currency Forex)
911 2018-09-05 21:54:54 Skripal was so tied up with the Christoper Steele and the evidence is pointing to Oleg being behind him. Putin didn't care about Skripal. Putin cares about oil contracts like every other head of state. Putin cares about the oligarchs who ran off with Russia's crown jewels
912 2018-09-05 21:54:52 If it’s actually 0 oil in your car, your engine may overheat. If it shows 0oil life, you still have oil but it’s not as libricating.
913 2018-09-05 21:54:41 He’s also oil refinery and pipeline owner.
914 2018-09-05 21:54:29 Absolutely right. And also remember who aided in the election of The Shitholer. Bernie Sanders, theses two Supreme Court picks might as well have been Old Snake Oil Salesman's
915 2018-09-05 21:54:13 Go eat oil
916 2018-09-05 21:54:12 Trying to arrange for Renz to get stuck in Malta because I've finally got all the motor oil off everything he's touched here and I know when he comes home it'll all be back.
917 2018-09-05 21:54:10 Car mechanic shops are infamous for putting nails in your tire and trying to up charge you when all you go in for is a oil change
918 2018-09-05 21:54:05 Except, almost for certain, Dems will cave on this. Just as they did on DACA. Just as they did on banning money from Big Oil. They just chose to fast track more than a dozen trump judicial appointees. It’s astonishing you don’t get it.
919 2018-09-05 21:54:04 Peppermint oil can be great for working out because it opens your airways for the maximum oxygen exchange and will give you more endurance during a workout!
920 2018-09-05 21:54:04 結構シャレにならないな 連絡取れるか……？
921 2018-09-05 21:53:42 @realDonaldTrump having to say you are the REAL trump is like you’re the cheese, the #realcheese the label says cheese yet we all know it’s made with oil and other ingredients just like you. We need a #realPOTUS not this fake cheese talking head. #ResignNow

924 2018-09-05 21:53:26 About the only bias I probably have is a large leaning on preferring that the oil development is owned by Canadians (companies and people).
925 2018-09-05 21:53:18 what don't you like about this particular chancellor?
926 2018-09-05 21:53:16 يمكن غلط
927 2018-09-05 21:53:16 Companies saying one thing & doing the other sound familiar? Palm oil industry regulator @RSPOtweets claims to boost ‘ethical’ #palmoil > truth is it certifies exploitation palm oil company @Indofood, @Nestle & @PepsiCo’s business partner
928 2018-09-05 21:53:08 The Federal reserve will bump interest rates up again...so far no sign of deflation or inflation... USA is sitting sweet... This will be passed on to other countries as well.  Oil going to tank... don't get caught holding the empty bag...
929 2018-09-05 21:53:07 the way that fox engine shows wet shine makes EVERYTHING look like oil instead of water, so wet barechested V just looks like hes all oiled up and ready for his camboy show
930 2018-09-05 21:53:03 The oil cooling line was shot. But it was covered by a warranty extension (the part was recalled back in 2016).
931 2018-09-05 21:52:54 For similar reasons I am fine with oil wealth existing to help all of Alberta, and not just Fort McMurray (or Cold Lake, or Peace River, etc.) areas.
932 2018-09-05 21:52:41 If my oil life percentage hits 0, what happens? Does my car blow up? Shut off? Cant afford a service until next friday. :(
933 2018-09-05 21:52:22 Get your oil changed. Save your car now and major dollars later.
934 2018-09-05 21:52:19 Just use E85 plus 2 gallons of cooking oil. Will save you $100 a month.
935 2018-09-05 21:52:07 Venezuela is suffering because of US sanctions #oil. I'm perfectly capable of assessing situations for myself thank you. Says a lot about you if you read the times. No longer wish to engage. Enough is enough.
936 2018-09-05 21:51:59 Qatar was born by the hardwork of our great Qatari grandfathers that went to the sea pearl diving. Then to Aramco to learn the profession of petroleum refininery under English and Dutch oil companies, I don’t recall foreigners working and risking their lives in those hard times
937 2018-09-05 21:51:45 You tough guy, you.  To each their own, certainly. I would rather drink motor oil.
938 2018-09-05 21:51:43 I’m going to be at the JW Marriott Hill Country Resort in San Antonio for an oil and gas industry conference for a few days.  I can’t tweet much, but pamp up crypto.

945 2018-09-05 21:51:04 I've never used snake oil in my life and it does sound amazing. I like the idea behind it, I think! 

My magic stuff is really pretty white. I'm the basic white girl of magic (?)

948 2018-09-05 21:50:40 Toss 'em in olive oil first if you can. Shit's good. Curry powder or cumin is also good on roasted cauliflower.
949 2018-09-05 21:50:27 DARN IT....WISH I WAS AT THE RANCH. MONTANA LOVES THEM SOME TRUMP. OIL AND GAS ARE MAKING MONTANA GREAT AGAIN. @FOXNEWS @CNN @MSNBC
950 2018-09-05 21:50:19 62 million people didn't know that @realDonaldTrump had already lost his mind.  Some of us knew, but he's a snake oil salesman and he conned a lot of people.
951 2018-09-05 21:50:18 *tuna in oil
952 2018-09-05 21:50:17 ...Because they have oil?
953 2018-09-05 21:50:12 I feel like garbage today and my dumbass scheduled an oil change today
954 2018-09-05 21:50:10 Yes, I guess it's better to use oil coming from foreign countries and employ their workers.  That makes a lot of sense.
955 2018-09-05 21:50:01 Just do it pussy cats!!! No safer way to move oil??
956 2018-09-05 21:49:52 put jaebeom in a pink or black silk shirt with 2 buttons undone and a little bit of oil on his chest so it’s glistening and call it a day..

960 2018-09-05 21:48:55 Yeah that 1st Amendment that he's just going to try to ignore? and his "Team Winner" in the oil industry too - including all the jocked-up rent-a-cops seeming to believe they're acting in any roles of sheriffs, going on right now at @NoBayouBridge in fact ! s/o @telesurenglish
961 2018-09-05 21:48:45 In preparation for the GEDS/UWI Caribbean Energy Policy, Societies, and Law Conference (Oct. 4, 2018), we are posting articles about oil and gas (past and present) in the Caribbean region. Check it out!

966 2018-09-05 21:47:38 Geez, the Kochs, Murray, Craft, and the rest of the coal and oil barons must have a warehouse full of these kooks for Donnie's use.
967 2018-09-05 21:47:27 Oil pens are the future.
968 2018-09-05 21:47:20 Fear is such a bitch.

Maybe fear feels good that it wields so much power.

Enough power to shake the world.
Enough power to destroy a kingdom.
Enough power to bring giants to their knees..

& it only takes a drop.
Just a drop & it spreads like oil.
Slick & invasive.
969 2018-09-05 21:47:13 Keep in mind that Vancouver really is a coal export port.  More coal moves out of Vancouver harbor than anywhere else in North America.

Coal good, oil bad for the environmental movement.
970 2018-09-05 21:47:09 Oh dear the sophistry of the energy minister on @RNBreakfast  is appalling. More snake oil from a blatant coal apologist trying his best to fool Australians rightly demanding climate change action.

974 2018-09-05 21:46:50 Why did my economics textbook have to refer to an oil change as a "lube job"
975 2018-09-05 21:46:47 宏々さんおはありですー！
976 2018-09-05 21:46:33 Almost ALMOST spelled Bastardes wrong. It's hand painted using an oil based gold paint and then a final top coat to protect it.
977 2018-09-05 21:46:21 I wish you good luck with this, yet I think the signs are on the wall that there will be a meltdown in oil stocks.
978 2018-09-05 21:46:16 Ugh big time! She needs to stop with her holistic snake oil crap and take care of her produce child, orange or is it apple? 
979 2018-09-05 21:46:06 Bayer/MonSatan Are you kidding? Babies have thrived just fine for millennia by being breastfed by healthy Mothers. They don't need your chemicals. Go sell your snake oil New World Odor to some other planet and stop ruining ours.

980 2018-09-05 21:45:12 Actually oil prices are good right now
981 2018-09-05 21:45:08 Imagine the Middle East never having any oil.......
982 2018-09-05 21:45:04 Saudi oil money. You dont need much imagination to figure that out.
983 2018-09-05 21:44:51 You got elected because 25% of Americans are idiots who fell for the snake oil salesman con job of a narcissistic bully insulting and badgering his way through the primaries and then cheated with the help of Putin to steal the election.
And no
you have only signed 1 bill into law
984 2018-09-05 21:44:49 Use shampoo/conditioner with keratin protein, and do a monthly hair mask using coconut oil! Also using some argan oil daily on the ends helps a lot.

995 2018-09-05 21:43:55 This victory comes at the cost of 100s of jobs of fellow Canadians who have just lost their livelihood. The fact that we have to deal with NAFTA negotiations shows the importance of diversifying oil exports. But now because of this decision we are still held hostage.

1001 2018-09-05 21:43:15 Thick and dry hair here: I use any tresemme shampoo and conditioner with moroccan oil in it or moisture rich ones. My brother’s hair is pretty much just like yours and he uses Ogx oil (both the cocconut and the moroccan oil sprays) and it’s been his lifesaver!
1002 2018-09-05 21:43:12 All travelers must comply w/ federal law on transporting marijuana & cannabis infused products, such as CBD oil, on board a flight. Officers are required to notify law enforcement if they discover these items while screening your property.
1003 2018-09-05 21:43:11 Oil!!!!!????? Fucking hell
1004 2018-09-05 21:43:04 No oil but ye’ve got the gas pipeline
1005 2018-09-05 21:42:52 Motorbikes fantastic to look at maybe but those oil leaks aren't brilliant for the jeans or the monoblocked driveway.

1011 2018-09-05 21:41:49 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Los Angeles sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
1012 2018-09-05 21:41:47 Also Texas is an oil state. A car is a necessity. This isnt New York City or LA lol
1013 2018-09-05 21:41:45 Yes I agree. But the person said if we don't go ahead with the pipeline how will we drive cars without gas - that oil isn't for Canadians to use so no relation.
1014 2018-09-05 21:41:16 That was sweet of ya, Firechild. Well, it's 5:30 pm EDT and I'm back again. Drop-in cetnre's open fer a free dinner tonite. Some kinda casserole tho. Ah, beggars can't be choosers, I reckon. I've settled fer worse: once a can of mackerel in oil, fulla li'l bones & cartilage. Mmm.

1025 2018-09-05 21:39:57 You can't just stop using oil and rely on green energy the next day. That is not going to happen. Our net production of population is nothing compared to India and China. With the pipeline or not, there would not be a significant difference. All this does is hurt Canada.

1028 2018-09-05 21:39:27 Oh man ok. Why can't we try harder to make oil an unnecessary commodity, cause it doesn't have to be this way if we changed our priorites... but I I'll try to understand your information anywat. Thanks.
1029 2018-09-05 21:39:21 My roommate brought home a baby mouse in a glue trap from work to rescue it. 
We got the poor lil guy out of the trap with some oil and are cleaning him then letting him chill. When he’s doing better we’re going to release him. 
He’s so scared. My heart is breaking.

1034 2018-09-05 21:38:18 Man-made climate change isn't a cult, despite what your buddies in the oil industry would like you to believe, and despite your unnecessarily obtuse visual aid there is an overwhelming scientific consensus that supports it. Don't believe the Koch Kult.

1041 2018-09-05 21:37:20 Hydro is 60%. Renewables (solar, wind etc) are 3% (could climb more but people are too scared). I'm not saying stop oil but rather we should use oil less and smart til the rest of Canada can get more renewables as a source of electricity, heating & cooling.

1047 2018-09-05 21:36:40 The timing points to this latest Novichok story being about Syria, but Syria itself and the Trump #SpyGate and Skripal attack stories were linked to Russian oligarchs and oil/gas in the waters around Cyprus.

1060 2018-09-05 21:35:24 Alex Jones is one of the most entertaining presenters out there. And the way he ends his shows peddling his super male vitality it makes one think of a 1920's snake oil salesmen, its comedy gold.
1061 2018-09-05 21:35:17 I downloaded Robinhood. The advise given to me is, invest in things you actually purchase. I have Nike, Apple, gold, and a few gas and oil company stocks. Get the ones with high dividends, you get money back from it. I haven’t bought a stock in two years and still earned $500
1062 2018-09-05 21:35:10 They have cured traffic. It’s called ‘mass transit’ but the oil barons and car industry are way too greedy to allow a cure. They lobby to stop it at every turn.

1077 2018-09-05 21:33:09 The U.S was well on its way to where it is now in terms of the oil they actually "need" to import from other countries. Has nothing to do with Dufus Trump

1079 2018-09-05 21:32:35 Some old crock in front of me just started up and covered me with soot and I need some oil, 5w30 will do.
1080 2018-09-05 21:32:33 "BP, bringing oil to US shores."
1081 2018-09-05 21:32:27 Haha... Good one. Even if Trump confined his destruction to the U.S. it still affects the rest of the world. But if you had a single clue you'd know he's screwing up international trade. Have fun paying more for food, cars, and other manufactured goods, not to mention oil.

1088 2018-09-05 21:31:47 He uses all borrowed to make traveling only, no any democratical dividends in any form in the country and they continued borrowing money, it's better that they ate all the money from sales of crude oil than committed on squandering the money they borrowed its worst corruption.
1089 2018-09-05 21:31:28 1.) moisturizing shampoo + conditioner. make sure it’s sulfate free! a good drugstore brand is OGX- I like the orchid oil or coconut curls ones.
2.) a serum or spray to help tame frizz. I either use an argan oil serum (again, OGX has a nice one) or It’s a 10 Miracle Spray.

1140 2018-09-05 21:26:05 Running argan oil through the ends or my hair usually helps and it doesn’t weigh down the curliness of my hair. Using a hair mask a couple times a month should bring back some moisture
1141 2018-09-05 21:25:59 Actually the only way you can pour oil on troubled Brexit waters is to refer the final position back to people for their first and only consideration of the final options, including withdrawal of Article 50.
1142 2018-09-05 21:25:58 Yep the 2 companies founded by U brothers never divested. Diebold now makes ATM software for Alfa Bank. Diebold is biggest client of Jones Day. McGahn is Koch lawyer and Jones Day. Follow money banks law firms PR firms oil voting machines etc.

Me: Ah yes, the height of fine dining
1152 2018-09-05 21:24:52 you use them for cleaning and in decanters to make rooms smell nice. like if you clean w vinegar, a couple droups of essential oil will make it smell nice and keep stuff clean longer. its extremely bad for you otherwise
1153 2018-09-05 21:24:43 Ok so it's my first time wearing it and I put it on at 8:30 and my face isn't greasy yet!! Any oil coming through just looks normal. My cheeks are usually normal so it does look dry on them. I think if I spray a dewy setting spray on them though it'll look good. I'm impressed!!
1154 2018-09-05 21:24:40 Good job, we all know it’s just a meeting to keep an eye on his oil stocks.
1155 2018-09-05 21:24:30 I usually switch up conditioners. I use Aussie leave in conditioner as well and the occasional Argan Oil.

1158 2018-09-05 21:24:17 i've considered getting some but im always distrustful of things that even vaguely resemble "snake oil"
1159 2018-09-05 21:24:05 Pour two grams of olive oil and bring to a boil.
1160 2018-09-05 21:23:52 I stopped washing my hair everyday and it took a hot min but now I shampoo ever 3-4 days (unless I’m sweating a lot), deep condition every week and treat with argon oil once it’s mostly dry and my thick but bleached asian hair is much happier now haha
1161 2018-09-05 21:23:42 If someone gives me a high-quality picture of themselves, preferably high resolution, I will make it into an oil painting. Just DM me if you want one. Won't take me long and I want to try this new FX I learned.

1172 2018-09-05 21:22:28 Oh that’s good about the mat. I just wanted to make sure. If he’s eating well and what not I wouldn’t be too worried yet. Also if the moss was actual plant material that should be ok as well. Yeah you’re best best is probably just some olive oil. He’s most likely not impacted.
1173 2018-09-05 21:22:28 2/2 the second thing is that your order was packaged during a transition phase, we are now only sending top flowers for dried product, the smaller bottoms are going into oil production.

1181 2018-09-05 21:21:47 You know that your trade deals give corporations the right to wind back &/or get compensation if our commonwealth legislates or regulates restrictions that diminish corporate profit. Like plain packaging of cigarettes or health warnings on palm oil. You're trading our sovereignty
1182 2018-09-05 21:21:45 Leave in conditioner helps a ton. I also put coconut oil in overnight at least once a week, it saved my hair after bleaching the hell out of it several times.
1183 2018-09-05 21:21:39 I don’t know why tf I made an appointment for 5 when I’ve been sitting in my car for twenty fuckin minutes waiting for this nigga to do my oil change . For this I could’ve went somewhere else

1189 2018-09-05 21:20:54 And why support any oil company if you want to leave the world a better place for your kids..?
1190 2018-09-05 21:20:51 Probably just more trade talks, oil and all that.

1195 2018-09-05 21:20:27 Why ?was MMS having oil subsidies in world countries. Of course he was an expert and clean but failed co- operation kept him in low profile. Even now if he thinks about people can give solid suggestions.
1196 2018-09-05 21:20:24 Did Canada invent a magic teleporter that can export oil and gas to Asia without pipelines and ships ?
1197 2018-09-05 21:20:23 Hey. I don’t I’m afraid, but think an agreed playbook would be a great idea. I think it would encourage more best practice & a little make life harder for those knowingly over-promising during pitches (plus the Snake Oil sellers / more unscrupulous end of the industry)
1198 2018-09-05 21:20:14 @Skippy how many rts for you to stop using palm oil

1200 2018-09-05 21:20:12 Mary Magdalene f**ked with Jesus, and on a trampoline with Egyptian massage oil is what I read. There was a lot of that back then. Oil that is. Everyone had it. Jesus saves at the Bank Of Alexandria.
1201 2018-09-05 21:20:12 Oil is pretty great. Black gold and all that jazz.
1202 2018-09-05 21:20:06 Invest in refineries in Alberta; refine the bitumin ourselves into oil and gas  (create more full-time jobs) and become less dependent upon on foreign governments for our oil and gas needs. It’d make Alberta, and the rest of the country, happy.

But think many of them are for possession eg oil, strategic land, rather than from moral justification.

1280 2018-09-05 21:12:10 Nu pakaar na dai chi we pay because of them. And secondly they saying the rise is because previous administration didn't changed the prices for 04 years sending the gas and oil sectors into crisis.
To hell with crisis, previous 04 years were good compared to these 04 shit weeks.
1281 2018-09-05 21:12:09 british is only hoping in the #BIAFRA oil that's why it keep promises
1282 2018-09-05 21:11:45 Yes... fighting terrorists, war in general is mostly training and doctrine. Until Iraq has an economy that can survive an oil price collapse, it needs a highly trained, nimble army, achievable on a budget. Sad but oil $ convinces many MPs cash is endless
1283 2018-09-05 21:11:44 BITCHES NEVER GET THEY OIL CHANGED THEY JUST DRIVE

1294 2018-09-05 21:10:31 Turns out it's not that rare, esp in the agriculture, mining, oil/gas, and military sectors.  A little bit of knowledge goes a long way too!

I think the concept of "The Purge" just doesn't work once you learn about the technologies we have and how dangerous people can be!

1304 2018-09-05 21:08:22 Nope, Ontario does not have the largest per capita debt in the world.

Technology does not develop on its own. The internet is a good example - developed by public money.

No, we don't all use the same amount of energy - or oil and gas.

Three strikes you're out?
1305 2018-09-05 21:08:19 No, that's just my porn name. By day, I'm a meek program manager. Come Friday, though, I break out the baby oil and earn a little extra on the side, if you know what I mean.
1306 2018-09-05 21:08:18 Like flour, oil, and eggs, I can't remember a time without it.
1307 2018-09-05 21:08:12 Have you read it? It was an addition which was rejected by the NEC. Don't know why he couldn't just go with what was agreed by the NEC without trying to change it. He's just poured oil on troubled waters and prolonging the issue.

1322 2018-09-05 21:06:05 Canada refines oil. Do you mean we should refine more and stop importing?
1323 2018-09-05 21:05:56 Barf. I’ve been watching and going from Amy Klobuchar to this oily snake oil salesman was very jarring. I’m watching Ellen right now and hope @BetoORourke kicks @tedcruz horrible ass
1324 2018-09-05 21:05:38 @AlikayNaturals well after all searching I return to JCP for your products they pulled them all Target only carry Essential  oil  in 5 towns.
1325 2018-09-05 21:05:22 1/4 lb quartered Brussels Sprouts , 1 tsp ground Cayenne Pepper, 2 tbsp olive oil.
1326 2018-09-05 21:05:15 It's terrifing to me. Obviously this stuff is non-reactive and safe. It's olive oil and carbon - who knows if there is any Buckminster Fullerene in there!?

But Phillip was right on point here with that point. This is one study of 18 rats (in THREE groups) done once.
1327 2018-09-05 21:04:57 They say all that coconut oil is bad.  Do one cup of bulletproof a week.

; then wash the hair mask off, after its off apply some conditioner and coconut oil to the ends of your hair.

1339 2018-09-05 21:03:00 Very good point.  Trump tried to sell snake oil to the Black community in 2016.  He had a handful of Black people that never did anything in the community and he trotted them out.  We just laughed at the show.  The reason Democrats have better policy is because we ARE Democrats.
1340 2018-09-05 21:02:57 My dog has has severe arthritis. The medication made her vomit and she still couldn't climb stairs. So,  I started her on CBD oil. She is doing amazingly well! She climbs stairs, plays with her brother, runs around the yard,  does ZOOMIES! I have my dog back!
1341 2018-09-05 21:02:50 Oil is not dilbit.

1344 2018-09-05 21:02:44 Do your research and find a good THC FREE CBD oil. It DOES help my anxiety..when I can afford it. Helps pain meds work better too. 
1345 2018-09-05 21:02:42 180 million people or more, eating, sleeping and contributing nothing to the world. All we do is drill oil, sell it, bank the money and share the proceeds!
Even the oil is drilled by foreign companies. We do nothing other than share the sales proceeds @hsoselari @hsoselari
1346 2018-09-05 21:02:28 I'm proud of @HibdonTiresPlus in #Tulsa for making it right when my son brought his car in for an oil change and left with a check engine light and a lot of concerns. Good job.
1347 2018-09-05 21:02:14 Doesent oil rise above water?
1348 2018-09-05 21:02:10 Someone please explain to me how I’m supposed to get new tires and an oil change if I work everyday until 5 or later and all the shops close at 5 as well? #adultingishard #someonepleasehelp
1349 2018-09-05 21:02:06 Interesting stuff, and available on Amazon. I appreciate the recommendation, had never heard of Neem Oil. Thanks
1350 2018-09-05 21:02:00 This is true. Mine had oil central heating which worked well...but I still had to break the ice in my toilet before I could use it a few times each winter. Living afloat is not for the faint hearted.

1355 2018-09-05 21:01:31 #FuelShortage fuel companies are hoarding oil because they cannot afford to buy fuel at a high price... And then Uhuru ascents to the bill, and they are forced to sell it at a lower price... Those are losses that they cannot afford to anticipate...
1356 2018-09-05 21:01:29 To all my dry skin brothers and sisters out there. Start using vitamin E oil, you won’t regret it.
1357 2018-09-05 21:01:18 No, it's a nightmare for many, many people. Family carers are on their knees with how bad things are. Glad you're fighting back. As the old saying goes: It's the squeaky wheel that gets the oil.
1358 2018-09-05 21:01:15 Need a freaking oil change.

1360 2018-09-05 21:01:00 Paris accord, pullout was mistake. Changing B.O.'s international policies is a great thing, B.O. was a disaster, tax code helped everyone not just the rich despite how Dems want to paint it,  ACA is/was crap; World runs on oil, we should always look towards improving renewables.
1361 2018-09-05 21:00:59 Alberta will need them because they have relied on oil for so long and their failure to diversify has put their economy is in the toilet. #abpoli #cdnpoli

Vitamin D3 is good against the flu.  So is coconut oil.
1378 2018-09-05 20:59:24 What cbd products are you trying for endo? I found a really good cbd oil that helped with insomnia + anxiety (Bright Isle cbd) But it keeps going out of stock and other brands aren’t as effective. Was hoping to build up to use it for pain too 
1379 2018-09-05 20:59:03 it's from cow brand mutenka's natural line!  it's their preservative free, mineral oil free, perfume free "fluffy" foam wash.

1384 2018-09-05 20:58:40 "why is my skin always so bad???" I ask while compulsively touching & scratching at my face 50 times a day and existing solely on a diet of oil and potatoes

1386 2018-09-05 20:58:20 As for Blair ... moral reasons? Fuck me. It was always about oil. Saddam had nothing, absolutely nothing to do with it.
1387 2018-09-05 20:57:50 Y don't u do this for marine issues on the EAST Coast? There we drill for oil offshore, ship 3X to 4X more oil by tanker than out west, have orcas, humpbacks, right whales, have major fisheries and import loads of oil from such places as Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Algeria, Iran
1388 2018-09-05 20:57:49 @JustinTrudeau  Excellent radio interview. I love "No deal is better than a bad deal." Its best not to act eager or worried. Trump looks for signs. Easy on Trump criticism; he's a narcissist. Maybe you can get oil lobbyists to influence him? They gave $107M to Trump's inaugural.
1389 2018-09-05 20:57:31 You can mix the Magnolia Oil with Epimax.
1390 2018-09-05 20:57:25 I know you are capable of compartmentalizing and working from sun up to sun down, burn the midnight oil and then some. Men who do that – who have no balance, they burn out. Have heart attacks. #1linewed #wip

1393 2018-09-05 20:57:11 I just mix honey with my Clean & Clear Exfoliating daily wash, then I lotion my face with Magnolia Oil from PEP. It works wonders.

1404 2018-09-05 20:55:48 I can't tell if Gwyneth Paltrow is a genius for selling people snake oil or if she's actually brainless
1405 2018-09-05 20:55:42 If teachers were fighting a war for oil and poppy fields they'd be fully funded.

1407 2018-09-05 20:55:34 The situation in Yemen Vs Saudi Arabia as oil & regional Ally against Iran, has absolutely nothing to do with the people of Venezuela & Nicaragua who want intervention. US once also helped Europe to get rid of Hitler, remember?

1409 2018-09-05 20:55:16 No they don't. SS said there was much more soluble gas in the Kimmeridge than the Portland. This  is what propells Free Flowing oil up the well. No pump needed. Hence the name The Gatwick Gusher :) Viva UKOG!

1411 2018-09-05 20:55:15 Good fibre plus some oil content. Haven't used it myself before works well
1412 2018-09-05 20:55:09 What about oil?
1413 2018-09-05 20:55:08 TMEP will send oil to Puget sound, California and growing markets in Asia. I linked a story for you with oil shipments going to China, South Korea and Thailand. Not my fault if you are to bounded by your virtuous anti oil position to read.
1414 2018-09-05 20:55:01 A half a dropper of CBD oil would probably  relax him/her a little bit.
1415 2018-09-05 20:54:54 lol

(for the avoidance of doubt, my laughter is ridiculing the idea that an oil futures contract means your currency is gold-backed--not for the idea of gold or a gold redeemable currency, which I take very seriously)
1416 2018-09-05 20:54:54 Of course, Hurrell would have put a gardenia next to your ear and coated you with oil.
1417 2018-09-05 20:54:46 "Natural is best," I smile as I smear peppermint oil over my month-old child and give them horrendous chemical burns
1418 2018-09-05 20:54:35 Venezuela is in the shit in great part because the people who knew how to extract oil have been replaced by party cronies. Nothing to do with the US. Try again.
1419 2018-09-05 20:54:30 My car is a year old and every time I bring it to get an oil change, they try to tell me I need to spend an extra $200 on literally anything lol. I’m always like, “hold on, let me call my dad” 
1420 2018-09-05 20:54:24 Aberdeen has a pretty interesting bimodal productivity curve — possibly North Sea oil + rest of economy?
1421 2018-09-05 20:54:19 It's amazing how the majority of Millennials dont know how to change a tire or oil on a vehicle. Or how most dont understand how to use basic power tools. Most dont know how to read a tape measure or use a protractor and compass.
1422 2018-09-05 20:54:17 manafort, stone are small time crooks set-up to take the fall in the attempt to pin all the blame on Russia.

1427 2018-09-05 20:53:55 US has always been strongly aligned with Saudi Arabia who funds most terrorist organizations: Al-Qaeda, ISIS, etc.

The only answer I can think of why America must tolerate these relations is due to oil.
1428 2018-09-05 20:53:50 true..... i used to use oil but it was really messy so flour is really the best!! you should definitely try it
1429 2018-09-05 20:53:43 Palm oil body @RSPOtweets has delayed deciding whether to kick #palmoil villain Indofood out for two years now. I want them to take action sooner!

1433 2018-09-05 20:53:18 I didn't know we still had hippy pharmacists!
It's not what you've eaten, it's the traces left around you, & garlic??? Vampire wasps?? Dilute peppermint oil, suck peppermints - and DON'T flap about. Wasps are generally cool.

1440 2018-09-05 20:52:00 It's a mixed bag. On the 1 hand, natural gas will reduce the dependency on oil. On the other, there are related environmental concerns.
1441 2018-09-05 20:51:51 Esa cloaca putrefacta y lo demás que tú llamas a Colombia, le está dando abrigo, comida, educación, trabajo , y pase por su territorio a parte de los 2,500,000 que ya huyen del "paraíso maduresco", cómo estará Venezuela?, que ellos " prefieren está cloaca"!!!
1442 2018-09-05 20:51:40 All the vehicles runs on the purchase of unserious rate of petrol and diesels...now miracles is that oil itself is moving since last week without any destination...
1443 2018-09-05 20:51:36 listen to me: rosehip oil. that’s all i’ve come to twitter to say.
1444 2018-09-05 20:51:31 I started using this hair oil and it makes my hair so soft and nice. Even tho my life's falling apart at least I'll have pretty hair

1446 2018-09-05 20:51:19 I have sympathy with FN on consultation process. We had to "negotiate" with oil corp about drilling on land we owned. We had no choice about the drilling & the attitude of the Oil corps is they can do whatever they want & you have to take it. Remediation was a joke. No oil found
1447 2018-09-05 20:51:19 It does t matter how many expose stories or anonymous op/Ed’s appear, until America grows a pair and tosses the snake oil salesman out of the people’s house.  But, Americans would rather bitch and listen to scintillating news stories than dobtheir civic duty to remove him now

1456 2018-09-05 20:50:36 Na it’s just oil
1457 2018-09-05 20:50:31 I won't be signing it. I noted ONE SENTENCE which agrees with the Reformed confessions and you'd have thought I kicked a puppy. Or a whole group of puppies -- cute ones. Try CBD oil.
1458 2018-09-05 20:50:29 This figure isn't meaningful alone - the increase in traffic volumes could be driven by population increase, economic recovery after the oil crash, increased mobility due to relocations from the oil crash, etc.

1466 2018-09-05 20:49:35 Hello frands in Pittsburgh! Does anyone have ramps or a lift I can borrow to change my motor oil? :D

1471 2018-09-05 20:48:27 Just dropped $30 on olive oil #HowItalianAreYou
1472 2018-09-05 20:48:24 just keep it clean and moisturised, annnnnnd I dont comb  finger detangling one way. I shampoo, condition, slap some leave in conditioner, coconut oil and shea butter while hair is damp and twist it

1475 2018-09-05 20:47:57 Mr. Secretary... What do you actually mean to relationships? Do you want our forces to work like mercenaries as always? Do you want us to sacrifice more men, women & children for the sake of Bloody American Interest? Do you need more blood to increase your oil reserves?
1476 2018-09-05 20:47:51 Niggaz don’t even know how to change the oil in his dame whip but want 50/50 boy MOVE..

1489 2018-09-05 20:46:14 Tea tree oil and coconut oil have been such a blessing to my skin. They both have like a million uses I don’t travel anywhere without em.
1490 2018-09-05 20:46:12 i been waiting for my car’s oil to be changed. this man flirted all in my face and told me 45 mins, an hour ago. i’m fed up 
1491 2018-09-05 20:46:11 Totally looks like a OIL PAINTING! <3
1492 2018-09-05 20:46:04 Companies saying one thing & doing the other sound familiar? Palm oil industry regulator @RSPOtweets claims to boost ‘ethical’ #palmoil > truth is it certifies exploitation palm oil company @Indofood, @Nestle & @PepsiCo’s business partner
1493 2018-09-05 20:46:03 You keep staying there is not enough refinery capacity for heavy oil, something that I have shown you is wrong. There is more capacity in the Gulf Coast, California and Asia. I get that your schtick is to spew ENGO misinformation, maybe try your luck with less informed people.
1494 2018-09-05 20:45:49 Building pipeline to produce&sell oil conflicts with  goal of reducing GHG emissions. PMJT is sucking&blowing at same time.

1497 2018-09-05 20:45:18 My home is heated and cooled by hydro. Water is renewable. No oil needed. I haven't had lived in a home with an oil tank since I was a kid.
1498 2018-09-05 20:45:11 You keep confusing "energy" with "oil"; they're not synonymous and you embarrass yourself each time you forget that.
1499 2018-09-05 20:45:09 I need to go home and put some coconut oil on my hair.
1500 2018-09-05 20:44:52 You joined cause you want oil

1508 2018-09-05 20:43:56 We agree!  It's cooked in soybean oil.
1509 2018-09-05 20:43:52 Does the Au/Ag ratio even matter? It is not like the Au/oil ratio, which indicates wither oil is cheap or expensive.
1510 2018-09-05 20:43:51 * The PCB regulations stems from an enviromental issue, as it is an oil component within other components that contaminates areas when it rains and goes into the ground water and fish which we then eat, is this a bad regulation by the state?
1511 2018-09-05 20:43:49 ain't that the truth. Btw congrats on the move... have a pretty good life going, live on the coast, write about the Oil
1512 2018-09-05 20:43:44 Deadass. They made me pay $50 something dollars for an oil change claiming my car needed high mileage oil but my dad wouldn’t answer the phone so I could ask him why that price was so much higher than normal. I hadn’t ever taken that particular car for an oil change.
1513 2018-09-05 20:43:39 When a girl cooks soup and it doesn't taste good. She will say anything to defend herself. You will hear 'The palm oil isn't Original'. 
1514 2018-09-05 20:43:24 How is it tjst peiple are such sheeple.  Is it possible that you can look at a guy like durbin who is a two bit snake oil salesman and beleive even one thing he does is for anyone but himself
1515 2018-09-05 20:43:17 Just gone and burnt my forearm with cooking oil so I don't think I'll be tweeting all that much until the pain has at least subsided (and maybe until the swelling has gone down). Ouch, ouch, ouch!! 
1516 2018-09-05 20:43:16 I’ll be a two Tesla family when my Acura dies. I secretly stopped going for oil changes
1517 2018-09-05 20:43:05 Do you support the ban on offshore oil drilling? Do you support regulations to protect the environment?
1518 2018-09-05 20:43:01 Lol people figure them out long now... Why is exxon only finding oil now after being off shore since we was lil boys? Why only now since all the other major countries’ oil wealth is depleting slowly? 
1519 2018-09-05 20:42:59 Lol I absolutely do but thanks! I switch up a lot but Desert Essence Thoroughly Clean Face Wash(Whole Foods), and rosehip oil with lavender are my mainstays.
1520 2018-09-05 20:42:46 Surely it should be The Greatest Oil In.
1521 2018-09-05 20:42:40 Quejona is flipping out about this oil change 
1522 2018-09-05 20:42:39 Oh mashed plantain,red oil den some groundnuts
1523 2018-09-05 20:42:37 Yorkshire tea in a teapot, Lindt chocolate kittens, a new series of Succession, a cashmere jumper and some rose-scented bath oil.
1524 2018-09-05 20:42:20 Evidently, as that doesn't make the point you think it does. We sell at a discount to high conversion, gulf coast, refineries as that's the ONLY place we can move significant volumes of our heavy oil to. Hence why TMEP is needed, it relieves the bottle neck and opens markets.
1525 2018-09-05 20:41:53 Outside crude oil, our GDP is a light weight. No strong industrial backbone. The Services sector we tout can’t grow stronger and bigger, held by factors such as horrible infrastructure
1526 2018-09-05 20:41:49 These new loans are self liquidating meaning the pay off themselves without having to make extra budget for debt servicing. Meaning the debt is paid from the revenue generated from the infrastructure not from our oil or tax.
1527 2018-09-05 20:41:46 I need the lavender/tea tree oil/eucalyptus combo! Was googling that this week. Any advice is good advice!!
1528 2018-09-05 20:41:45 I've never seen tuna with olive oil in Iceland/Denmark/Germany. I might not have been looking. I don't find sunflower oil good with anything. I don't know what brine is.

I live in the heart of the north Texas oil field. Being able to see stress and strains across the board on oilfield equipment is huge! 
1679 2018-09-05 20:24:12 Yes oh... Lip gloss too and Anointing oil 
1680 2018-09-05 20:24:03 gotta get a cpap so i can modify it to pop in some oil every hour or so
1681 2018-09-05 20:23:58 That’s who you’re fighting for, Trumps oil. Or is it Putin oil you prefer?
1682 2018-09-05 20:23:54 My daddy came and got my tires fixed, car inspected, and an oil change 
1683 2018-09-05 20:23:48 Why would I put this body oil on 
1684 2018-09-05 20:23:43 Oil fumes whisk me away to bliss pls
1685 2018-09-05 20:23:40 Olive oil and salt on all my salads
1686 2018-09-05 20:23:27 Heid, how's Barney?x

1688 2018-09-05 20:23:13 Paper - I assume the oil, yes. But some kind of cornstarch packaging perhaps? I am sure there must be a better alternative...
1689 2018-09-05 20:23:12 Happily, when I got to HS, we all had equal chance to take Driver's Ed which included engines, oil how-to, tire changes, etc. 

Just out of curiosity, did the sewing ever come in handy?? I have a male friend who cosplays now, & WISHES he knew how to sew better!  #Irony
1690 2018-09-05 20:23:10 Everytime they do my oil I be thinking they put the wrong kind in.
1691 2018-09-05 20:23:09 You will love ! Just cut into pieces and boil.. wait till it’s warm and remove skin and mash with a little salt, pepper and butter or olive oil. And done.. you can eat it with eggs, chicken, steak or shrimp
1692 2018-09-05 20:23:03 And look nofurther than the USA ...major gas flaring associated with tight oil production.

1695 2018-09-05 20:22:41 It's a council.  They discuss.  They haven't solved the TerraWatthours needed to transform the BTUs needed for both transport and possibly replacement of oil/gas resources for heating.
1696 2018-09-05 20:22:29 People are hungry  that looks like coconut oil to me 
1697 2018-09-05 20:22:28 I need to get back on the vitamins and fish oil. I've been feeling mad drained recently
1698 2018-09-05 20:22:22 Are you similarly concerned about baby oil?
1699 2018-09-05 20:22:17 Yeah dude I'm not a naive dolt, so I'm not swayed by memes or opinion pieces with scary photos. You know what is way more frightening than climate change? The death and anarchy that would ensue w/o oil. Oil's dick is so far down your throat you don't know whether to gag or fart.
1700 2018-09-05 20:22:13 oil or acrylic??
1701 2018-09-05 20:22:10 Building a list of people with cool jobs in oil and gas and I'm surprised at how many I know just from going through my LinkedIn! Any of my followers here have interesting oil and gas jobs???
1702 2018-09-05 20:22:07 They put the salad fork on the wrong side.
1703 2018-09-05 20:22:00 If it is an infection, some antibiotics should do the trick.  There's also mineral oil that can help with the pain in the meantime.  Feel better soon.
1704 2018-09-05 20:21:55 Tell the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil to stop dragging its feet and kick @Indofood off its certifying scheme for good! @RSPOtweets #palmoil #savetheorangutans
1705 2018-09-05 20:21:40 I’m not of faith but think I’m a good egg if not perfect. Unlike you, no benefit of a private education, no large salary in oil industry, not head of an organisation with huge assets (without paying fare tax share). I’ll choose who/what I support. You are a hypocrite. Go away.
1706 2018-09-05 20:21:35 If you just let them indict him, we can go back to tax cuts for the rich, tax exemptions for sport's team owners (like me), cuts to Medicare and Social Security, and being big oil men and women with our big government only between women's legs.
1707 2018-09-05 20:21:28 @energyproj This is an irresponsible deceitful mouthpiece for Colorado Oil & Gas Industry. Yes, we NEED 2,500 ft set back to protect human lives (explosions killing ppl) & property values. While we’re at it lets increase real SEVERANCE TAXES without exemptions.
1708 2018-09-05 20:21:28 monthly surplus could have been in $Billions had Canada been willing to export oil instead of import and remain captive supplier to US, 2 largest transfer payments from Cdn taxpayers, to OPEC and to US.

1711 2018-09-05 20:20:57 Marco gets a tiny example of the bullshit we’ve been dealing with for 10 years now. Disingenuous, lying snakes just out to make a name for themselves and sell some snake oil.

1713 2018-09-05 20:20:54 Oh but, it's the lovely oil that make a good crisp. There are some things that just aren't meant to have a healthy option! :D
1714 2018-09-05 20:20:26 There was an oil production inflection in 1973 a peak of production, concurrently OPEC reduced production to support the Palestinians. Since then new technologies have been developed to extract oil, fracking etc.
1715 2018-09-05 20:20:25 Saudi Arabia - "Investments in technology companies will not transform Saudi Arabia's economy nor will they diversify the economy's sources of revenue away from oil", @EnergzdEconomy, author of the book "Saudi Inc", told AFP.
1716 2018-09-05 20:20:23 Have you looked in to making your own cbd oil? I take my home made stuff daily, easy to make and cheap
1717 2018-09-05 20:20:19 Literally every plastic pipe broke due to age/heat cycling. Breather pipes,water pipes,the lot. The amount of water pipes is unreal.first one I've done and hopefully the last.oh,and the oil strainer in the sump blocked up at the same time.
1718 2018-09-05 20:20:13 Oregano oil tastes like battery acid but it works 
1719 2018-09-05 20:20:11 We are paying for this crap?             Investigate Ross’ insider trading.
Investigate Zinke & deals with oil/coal.  LOTS of things actually worthy of an investigation.
1720 2018-09-05 20:20:07 ....when PEI is under water in 2050 will the oil billionaire s like Trudeau ,Bush, Binladen & Mulroony be sharing what they have with me ? Opposed

1722 2018-09-05 20:20:03 IMF projects it's inflation to be a million %. It also has the largest accumulation of proven oil reserves. The latter doesn't matter because if Elon Musk succeeds, the automakers will have to make a move towards electric cars which means crude prices will go down to it's nadir.
1723 2018-09-05 20:19:46 Make sure you do rest up, have freezer well stocked. Snacks for wee hours of the morning, rich tea and granola bars helped sustain me, sea salt eucalyptus, lavender and tea tree oil and get a travel mug! ( I know you didn’t ask for unsolicited advice but ....
1724 2018-09-05 20:19:27 Fish always got the most out of his team. Musselman is a snake oil salesman who couldn’t care less about his kids or their future. He’s about as elite as Steve Alford IMO.

1736 2018-09-05 20:18:01 I use “One ‘n Only Argan Oil Curl Cream” for everyday use or when i want a more messy/fun look and then “Miss Jessie multicultural curls” for special occasions bc it holds the curls longer and keeps them stiffer and cleaner
1737 2018-09-05 20:17:58 I have no idea what type of pain you are going through or your circumstances but have you looked into CBD oil? It has honestly been a life changer for me. Not only taking the majority of my pain issues away but generally making me feel healthier. @guru_cbd is a great company.
1738 2018-09-05 20:17:47 Hugs! Feel better! *rubs back with oil*
1739 2018-09-05 20:17:45 little inconvenient Trudeau Party purchased pipeline on behalf of Cdn taxpayers without waiting for results of all court cases against in pipeline for Cdn oil. @JustinTrudeau and @Bill_Morneau obviously did not use their own money, only created liability for middle class.
1740 2018-09-05 20:17:38 Almost nobody agrees with that. You are easily flattered which makes you weak. Your admin is a revolving door of cons  and snake oil salesmen. You did manage a tax cut for the rich. Not much to brag about.
1741 2018-09-05 20:17:29 try meladol. (cbd oil with melatonin. much better and to the point. Cibdol produces it. works on ur endocannabinoid system.)

1744 2018-09-05 20:17:15 Does anyone know why crisp packets can't be made from paper? Is it the oil? #Zerowasteweek #zerowastehour
1745 2018-09-05 20:17:12 Remember when the media gave live coverage to Tea Party rallies with only 7 people while ignoring #OccupyWallStreet & oil pipeline protests?
1746 2018-09-05 20:17:05 Have you had luck with fish not falling apart after sous vide? Tough for me to get a nice crisp when it is so flaky?

Also, I am skeptical that the oil in the bag does anything.

I could get into this haha
1747 2018-09-05 20:17:05 You know that knocking sound in your engine? Bet you thought it was an octane issue. Nope; non-Alberta oil.
1748 2018-09-05 20:17:01 Just like water && oil........ me && you bitches don’t mix!
1749 2018-09-05 20:16:56 We do. He and another engineer stood by me while a certain oil major supt tried to stitch me up and failed
1750 2018-09-05 20:16:54 I luv orangutans soooo much, can we stop eating palm oil plz xxxxx
1751 2018-09-05 20:16:50 A record inset the oil tanks used them....
1752 2018-09-05 20:16:50 tired of this war between all of you! How about working on medical, balanced budget, congressional integrity, school equality and better teacher pay, crime, divorce laws, child custody equality, oversee defense companies, oil dependency, better medical care for our soldiers, ect
1753 2018-09-05 20:16:45 Have you looked at alternative therapies my friend? Rick Simpson oil. Raw food diet. Bone broth. Lemon water etc? Had success our end

1757 2018-09-05 20:16:39 The Phillies have an opening tonight. Which means the folllowing:

Pivetta will give up 40 runs tonight. Gabe will throw up coconut oil which will somehow cause Nola to slip and get hit by a random satellite falling out of orbit. Hoskins will fall through the planet. Etc.
1758 2018-09-05 20:16:36 Look forward to seeing this one on the fact check. “Fact: our incinerator (sorry combined heat and power plant) runs 1.5 metres directly above a major high pressure oil pipeline and we haven’t consulted with the pipeline operator”  @LeaBankEnergy
1759 2018-09-05 20:16:31 what's everybody's favorite essential oil
1760 2018-09-05 20:16:24 my mother gave me a fish oil supplement and I broke it in half and swallowed the oil from it. don't ever do that if you like yourself.
1761 2018-09-05 20:16:15 "The bigger concern is not what the Steward has done to Gondor, but rather what we as a kingdom have allowed him to do to us. We have sunk low with him and allowed our discourse to be stripped of civility. But yes, we're still bringing the oil to Faramir's pyre."
1762 2018-09-05 20:16:09 i use coconut oil religiously
1763 2018-09-05 20:16:03 Buy what? My thinking is Saudi Arabia creates a short term price increase in oil to increase the price of share in a Saudi Aramco IPO.
1764 2018-09-05 20:16:03 Oh yeah. Crude is how much per barrel? $75? Cannabis oil for 100 ml is close to that if not more.
1765 2018-09-05 20:16:00 yup!! I need that and blessed oil. we gotta protect ourselves
1766 2018-09-05 20:15:56 Again not basing economy on oil fields we have plenty other natural resources oil fields are a bonus
1767 2018-09-05 20:15:40 my skin is always so dry lol, i can’t be without my body oil.
1768 2018-09-05 20:15:23 Yes. They are.  These supposedly 'holier than thou' hypocrites picket and protest pipelines as if they themselves do not depend on or use oil and its products.  A more delusional/dishonest bunch of self-important fools would be hard to find!  Well...probably the Liberal Party
1769 2018-09-05 20:15:21 Lovecraft Conrad's description of Oil, a pact through the water table is more necessary.
1770 2018-09-05 20:15:19 And apply eminent domain only for oil pipelines, not for railroads.
1771 2018-09-05 20:14:58 Well, with a face like a horse, you're not exactly an oil painting for straight guys
1772 2018-09-05 20:14:45 So just listened to the news: 2 things caught my attention: (1) #NAFTA dictates Cda must sell 75% of its oil to US abd (2) #Notley wants to sell oil to everyone but US.  Whose telling the truth? Basis for a new Cdn game show? #cdnpoli
1773 2018-09-05 20:14:44 it's kind of weird that when the Middle East was left to itself, it was the birthplace of civilization, and continued to innovate regardless of the prevailing religion, but as soon as Westerners decided the best way to get oil was to blow up the middle man, it's lol brown people
1774 2018-09-05 20:14:42 Oh I forgot. PPP has achieved something that no one could have in complete world... By taking out honey and olive oil from liquor bottles..
1775 2018-09-05 20:14:32 We call canning "preserving" here.I have my Ma in Laws old preserving pan.She was a master of the craft.I must start preserving again. You should have seen my pantry after the earthquake we had here...glass,fruit,sticky syrup and olive oil everywhere!
1776 2018-09-05 20:14:21 Snake oil. Very expensive snake oil but snake oil just the same
1777 2018-09-05 20:14:07 Ati naskia hakuna fuel Nairobi juu oil tanker trucks zimekwama Mtito Andei juu zimeishiwa na fuel pia #FuelShortage
1778 2018-09-05 20:13:48 Exactly. And English = superiority, doing Scotland Down, stealing the oil, the poll tax, treat Scots like 2nd class citizens etc, etc. Unfortunately very few Scots I know take an interest in reading about the truth.
1779 2018-09-05 20:13:15 If I consistently oil my scalp then no but if I don’t then it’s OVER 
1780 2018-09-05 20:13:15 That can prove beneficial, depending on the beard oil you used.
1781 2018-09-05 20:13:14 How do you put coconut oil in the food human beings are planning to eat 
1782 2018-09-05 20:13:13 I actually don’t put anything to make it grows it grows naturally. But I put diwe bopou and beard oil that makes it shiny. I hope this help.
1783 2018-09-05 20:13:12 I am a clergyman of 40 years and I know what I am talking about. Welby may have many faults but he knows his stuff when it comes to finance, as he was in the oil industry before being ordained. I don't vote Labour but I do take the Gospel seriously.
1784 2018-09-05 20:13:09 Lying snake oil salesmen like alex jones are just as essential to the ecology of the swamp as the bribe taking grifter politician.
1785 2018-09-05 20:12:56 Same here. It's something I've always advocated for. I've seen parents use CBD oil at crazy prices for their kids with sickle cell attacks. Something we can research and stabilize here.

1789 2018-09-05 20:12:50 when it is crystal clear....Alberta government, the Feds, CAPP and big oil have the intention of endless tarsand expansion...
1790 2018-09-05 20:12:49 @HeyAprill is it oil or moisturizer last??? everyone says differently so idk
1791 2018-09-05 20:12:49 Hate that company. They essentially make money selling snake oil. People actually fall for it too. Those stupid eggs are just one example.
1792 2018-09-05 20:12:45 I can't wait until I can afford olive oil
1793 2018-09-05 20:12:44 Jesus Christ. My appointment for an oil change was at 1:30. I have now been here for AN HOUR AND FORTY MINUTES. This is horseshit.
1794 2018-09-05 20:12:41 Tea tree oil pls do ur shit n clear my face

1796 2018-09-05 20:12:29 I wish my oil exploration stocks were getting only as "killed" as Nike.

1800 2018-09-05 20:11:45 the oil on that damn pillar made me smell like lube for a week
1801 2018-09-05 20:11:25 Yes! If they do get kind of crusty I used tea tree oil on them.
1802 2018-09-05 20:11:25 We should withhold Equalization payments until Pipelines are built and then pay in only half !
The Feds would soon learn to treat Alberta with respect !
Anyone remember the '50s when the Feds refused to invest in Oil  ??
We had to go to foreign investors !
1803 2018-09-05 20:11:12 Sick. The Ukrainian oil exploration loan I'm trying to sell has been such a crushing defeat. I am so caned.
1804 2018-09-05 20:11:12 indeed, your beloved Alberta premier ran heavy ad campaign here in B.C....and the rose coloured all is good spinfest advertisement said this...."TMX expansion is not for increased oil production, it's for selling oil already produced into overseas markets"
1805 2018-09-05 20:11:00 I don’t use oils in cake much, but when I do it tends to be refined coconut oil.
1806 2018-09-05 20:10:52 Yeah, it was! They had this tomato oil sauce shit. Absolutely incredible. And the Dino BBQ ribs are top notch. Pretty fun town, I was surprised
1807 2018-09-05 20:10:44 Numbers 28:12 And three tenth deals of flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, for one bullock; and two tenth deals of flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, for one ram; #Pray

1809 2018-09-05 20:10:24 A well oiled machine. Because they keep getting rid of machine parts so all that's left is a little oil here and there.

1817 2018-09-05 20:09:55 Africa Oil And Power 2018, continues at the Cape Town International Convention Centre (CTICC) until 7 September. #AOP18 #ENRAT2018
1818 2018-09-05 20:09:52 Me and grandma watching blockers 

Movie: here’s coconut oil. I heard it’s good for lube and makes blow jobs taste like almonds joys.

Grandma: shitttt anit nothing good about sucking a dick but you can’t knock it till you try it. 
1819 2018-09-05 20:09:49 One time they even vacuumed my car!!! I was like omg I’m so sorry I didn’t want to put you guys through that lol they’re like the chik fil a of oil changes
1820 2018-09-05 20:09:37 Grown man saying arab oil 
1821 2018-09-05 20:09:29 These facilities have to potential to save $$$ by upgrading for energy efficiency. I’ve been to many of them but I can’t help as they are almost exclusively oil heated. You know my name, look up my number anytime.
1822 2018-09-05 20:09:21 I’m not stating anything about England, simply that it’s a bit silly to base a national economic future on ‘two new oil fields in north Shetland’
1823 2018-09-05 20:09:19 @BraveTart Fav vegetable oil for cake baking?
1824 2018-09-05 20:09:18 Exxon Mobil has the most remaining reserves among the aforementioned 
oil and gas supermajors. 

ExxonMobil is sitting atop 28,069 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) 
exceeds Shell at 27,012 million boe in 2017. 

A barrel already discovered is one that really counts.
1825 2018-09-05 20:09:13 I thought covering my pillows and bedding in olbas oil was a good idea to help clear my never ending cold..it wasn’t, I’ve been sat in bed for 2 minutes and my eyes are burning
1826 2018-09-05 20:09:00 HAHAHA I'm getting an oil change and the mans couldn't get in bc how close I have the seat to the steering wheel 
1827 2018-09-05 20:08:58 The US has the highest median quality of life, and the only places where canada has a high quality of life is along the US border. the only thing you have better than us is the medical insurance which is only subsidized out of selling oil to the US.
1828 2018-09-05 20:08:47 Enough time to have a discussion with IK. India is going to be tough with demands for stopping Import of oil from Iran and stopping arms purchase from Russia
1829 2018-09-05 20:08:28 My friend gave me the top and oil and i got a bottom from a smoke shop
1830 2018-09-05 20:08:21 I‘m allergic to fish. Is fish oil supplementation an option for me?
1831 2018-09-05 20:08:21 If this bitch doesn’t quit with the peppermint oil bullshit I’m gonna puke on her shoes. Lady we’re in a closed office and not everyone wants to smell that.
1832 2018-09-05 20:08:15 No oil and no money in Nicaragua. Nicaraguans people are fighting civically and making protest internationally. Cameroon needs to do the same. No body is going to do for them.
1833 2018-09-05 20:08:12 Yes girl I hate it. Tbh the upcoming fall/winter thing is the main reason why I haven’t bought a new body oil yet. No one is going to see it. I may stock up before spring comes in.
1834 2018-09-05 20:08:00 had two anxiety attacks at school today but now i’ve eaten a chicken sandwich and took two doses of cbd oil and i’m gonna eat ice cream until i fall asleep because responsibilities are for losers!
1835 2018-09-05 20:07:58 Agreed, he is riding on the coatails of HOPE, previous admins and whomever he can to sell his snake oil.
1836 2018-09-05 20:07:53 big oil made a deal back in 68 with some sort of power you know? and nobody seems to care
1837 2018-09-05 20:07:38 The trick is in the burning point: olive oil is perfect for frying if it not reaches its burning point And it will not reach its burning point if there is something to pick up the heat it is transferring (to the meat, eggs, fish, whatever is in the pan)

Greece olive oil 10/10
1838 2018-09-05 20:07:21 Cinnamon to add some flavour, but seriously add some coconut oil it will help you think straight
1839 2018-09-05 20:07:20 I need a lifetime supply of jojoba oil.
1840 2018-09-05 20:07:05 If uche secondus likes let him reconcile heaven and earth, the way PDP is going down this upcoming election they will later discover oil
1841 2018-09-05 20:07:04 I've always wanted to know why they throw it into the oil?
1842 2018-09-05 20:06:52 Done my first hot oil treatment in my hair in a few months and it felt goooox 
1843 2018-09-05 20:06:36 Indeed 'if you are looking for arms (weapons of war) go to Sambisa', and it is so because Northern elites abdicated their responsibility at home in pursuit of political power and oil money in Abuja thereby leaving their youth vulnerable for easy manipulation by demented relatives
1844 2018-09-05 20:06:29 Ewan po. basta kong dumadami ang may trabaho. Dumadami din ang may pera. Dahil dito tumataas ang presyo ng bilihin. Isama mo pa oil price sa world market.
1845 2018-09-05 20:06:23 My bad. I make sure my hair is oiled up first, then take a little cantu loc gel for the roots. (I use tea trea, jojoba, and coconut oil)
1846 2018-09-05 20:06:18 Oil avoid karun??
1847 2018-09-05 20:06:16 thank you babe!!!!  im going for the ginger one cause i feel like the olive oil would make me throw up haha, i just want my voice back lmao
1848 2018-09-05 20:05:50 NYT Magazine did a great piece on her and Goop not too long ago, basically calling Goop overpriced snake oil quackery. GP is making millions off of it.
1849 2018-09-05 20:05:49 dang really? i’m a glitter hoe tbh. i just now started buying the body oil without shimmer because i know winter’s coming and no one’s gonna see it (plus i’ve been using it in my hair).
1850 2018-09-05 20:05:42 The number of refineries saying why bother is growing. Especially when they can get oil products with that waste already removed for less money and less shipping costs.
1851 2018-09-05 20:05:34 tell that to the family of the woman kept in An Iran jail longer than she should because you are like to diplomacy like oil is to water, never mix. Your lack of empathy does you no credit. your incompetence tells the world never mind the U.K., you are not fit to be an MP n/m PM
1852 2018-09-05 20:05:28 Maybe I should try oil paint now
1853 2018-09-05 20:05:05 Add a squirt of shea oil or Argan oil
1854 2018-09-05 20:05:03 i can look at you and tell if you own beard oil
1855 2018-09-05 20:04:38 Donuts, I really love donuts. But just because you use #glutenfree batter and heat the oil in your shared fryer to 400 degrees does NOT make the donut gluten-free. Again, heat does not remove gluten.
1856 2018-09-05 20:04:36 My friend gave me the half with the oil and i got a battery from a smoke shop.
1857 2018-09-05 20:04:34 Well Scott, we would like to sell oil to China, but can’t get it to Tidewater, probably thanks to people like you. But, China gets a large part of the coal through the Vancouver port, and they continue to build coal plants. So, maybe put that in your pipe and smoke it.
1858 2018-09-05 20:04:28 Squirt oil on the ledge.
1859 2018-09-05 20:04:19 Oil supply companies should not bow to intimidation. And if they are to resume operation, they should ensure all are on board. In fact at this the should intensify the boycott.
1860 2018-09-05 20:04:13 @PepsiCo @Nestle @Pizza Hut & @TacoBell spend millions on their ‘ethical’ image & say they only use RSPO-certified #palmoil. But truth is @RSPOtweets gives the OK to destructive palm oil by brand @Indofood #savetheorangutans
1861 2018-09-05 20:04:07 Somebody tell BJP,  We haven't elected the Govt to learn Economics of Oil Pricing.
1862 2018-09-05 20:04:06 To be fair, as a local mechanic, I mostly see Mercedes-Benz. Those vehicles have starters that prematurely fail, and main bearings that discolor due to lack of oil. Some customers also complain of AC performance.... Which I haven't been able to link to start/stop..But I'm close.
1863 2018-09-05 20:04:00 How can you impose tax on an already taxed item #FuelHike Yet recently oil was unearthed in Turkana @TullowOilKenya . #webeniureure #shithole
1864 2018-09-05 20:03:58 Wow, not quite. You are aware that the vehicle emission standards are higher in america, right? and your oil/coal/lumber consumption is higher as well, right? You certainly dont know much about the US. Per capa, CA produces the same metric tons of CO2 as well.
1865 2018-09-05 20:03:42 Bwana Wakili the absence of fuel is not a making of the "Big Oil Companies"......the resellers/customers have ganged up and said there will be no trucks loading and leaving the Terminals at Nanyuki Road.
Actually, the "Big Oil Companies" want to sell so much.
Just for the record
1866 2018-09-05 20:03:30 Oil or pen?
1867 2018-09-05 20:03:23 I bought chocolate w CBD oil in it and I'm living
The lady said it doesn't really have enough in it to have a huge effect but we'll see what happens after I eat a whole bar in one sitting
1868 2018-09-05 20:03:06 Join Us THURSDAY September 6, 2018 @ 7:30pm.
Thou Anointed Our Heads With Oil. Let It Run Down.

One Service Can Change Your Entire Life!
1869 2018-09-05 20:03:01 Feel your pain!! Funny thing was that when I told my mother and step-father about it, he said: "Well, everyone knows that about cashew seed oil. It's so strong they use it sometimes to discipline elephants." 

I somehow missed that class in school...
1870 2018-09-05 20:02:58 Si tengo mucho oil canadiense porque pienso que poco a poco se irá solucionando pero no me esperaba este contratiempo y también está por ver que el enbridge line 3 entre en servicio en 2019 que tengo mis dudas
1871 2018-09-05 20:02:58 My oil pen exploded and I’ve wreaked of weed all day
1872 2018-09-05 20:02:14 I rub her down in oil !
1873 2018-09-05 20:02:03 massage peppermint oil on ur scalp/do hair masks that have castor oil, coconut oil & honey in em lol u could diy tbr
1874 2018-09-05 20:01:56 Almond & grape seed oil probably the lightest oils but coconut oil smells so good so ima put on that lol
1875 2018-09-05 20:01:39 love that fashion week survival kits have evolved to cbd oil in various forms
1876 2018-09-05 20:01:25 Oil and Gas RESOURCES>>>>>Iron Ore RESOURCES>>>>>HUMAN RESOURCES>>ALL are getting exploited<<<BY Gov/Bank/Labour Hire parasites (Wage Theft) and foreign non tax paying corps< people mean nothing to beancounters who look at you like a RESOURCE and PERCENTAGES on a bit of paper!
1877 2018-09-05 20:01:25 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.
1878 2018-09-05 20:01:20 In your article on "snake oil," it would be good if you include why physics Nobel laureate Dr. Wolfgang Pauli, physicists Dr. Victor Mansfield, Dr. David Peat, Dr. David Kahn, chemist Dr. Joseph Cambray, biologist Dr. Rupert Sheldrake, all of whom extend his work, were duped.

1880 2018-09-05 20:00:33 Look how long this country took to realize that weed is not dangerous. We’re STILL on that battle while other parts of the world are light years ahead. Our country is run by major corporations who decide what is for us. Oil, tobacco, alcohol, all those corps...
1881 2018-09-05 20:00:25 You should watch Bill Nye talk about it in Netflix @IsuphJt 

It's much more economically viable than crude oil and it's such a versatile resource
1882 2018-09-05 20:00:16 Get Camphor oil, rub it on the area around your ears and your neck, apparently old folks remedy anua it dries them out, I tried it with my daughter, worked like a charm or I'd like to think it did.
1883 2018-09-05 20:00:02 what about the one that comes over and fills up the oil in your car?
1884 2018-09-05 19:59:59 Guyana is already a vassal state of the US. It doesn't need to invade. They process Cuban visas there, they train their military there, one of their largest companies discovered the oil and will be profiting massively from it. Military intervention is unnecessary.
1885 2018-09-05 19:59:43 Trying to remember the name of one shakira song that she sang in Spanish. She was covered in black paint or crude oil in the video
1886 2018-09-05 19:59:39 My Italian husband’s family consistenly fry with olive oil. They look down on frenchies cooking with sunflower oil. Frying with butter or ghee is not even heard of
1887 2018-09-05 19:59:31 I’ve been wanting to try that toner! And let me know if that oil cleanser’s any good. I’m debating between that one and the yellow banila co. one
1888 2018-09-05 19:59:27 As an Oregonian I have to interject. First off they're Filberts. Hazelnut is some industry bullshit. Like Canola Oil instead of Rapeseed Oil. Second, Filberts are delicious fresh out of the shell. But much enhanced with a short roasting.
1889 2018-09-05 19:59:15 Trump has single handedly pushed crude oil from $43/barrel to $70/barell approx. 

And he says he is trying to make America Great again !!

America was always Great till the white House got occupied by a petty commission agent. A President who sells to highest bidder
1890 2018-09-05 19:59:01 Put some wound wash or jojoba oil on it and move it around a bit. That helped me a lot skdjsjs
1891 2018-09-05 19:58:46 Candidate Canada   @JimCarrey blow two   at both ends of oil pipe lines @HillaryClinton folks trafficking trades into America Americans @Pontifex Columbia prostitute got a paycheck in codes of @JebBush Florida find prison breached©®rape case! Priest victimized.
1892 2018-09-05 19:58:42 Come on guys, Donny is a NYC real estate guy
If your not a Texas oil Baron, 
you are a Hillbilly, like the song by Hank.
You rate right next to Puerto Ricans to a NYC elite.
1893 2018-09-05 19:58:42 When oil’ dude said, “A person can not befriend you if they’re secretly jealous of you.” >
1894 2018-09-05 19:58:40 I finally got a pen for my THC oil. I’m boutta be high af. 
1895 2018-09-05 19:58:37 animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
1896 2018-09-05 19:58:30 It was a great one, but you were greatly missed! Hope all is ok.
1897 2018-09-05 19:58:29 That literally was the first thing I noticed at a glance 
1898 2018-09-05 19:58:26 So love is sweet like this,you people didn't tell me  Nyner won't kill me ...
1899 2018-09-05 19:58:22 While citing statistical data from India and other countries show curiosity on your part, we need more. While do we have square pegs in round holes in Nigeria? Isn't this democracy too expensive for Nigeria's economy to sustain? Apart from oil,  what do we produce?
1900 2018-09-05 19:58:20 Uhmmm where did I say anything about #American oil?? Where do I mention #POTUS? 

You just let everyone know you are a #Trudeau supporter & get your facts from #MSM 
1901 2018-09-05 19:58:18 Piston rings or a head gasket? Blue smoke is from oil, white would be from coolant
1902 2018-09-05 19:58:03 U must ve discusses about Honey and olive oil saga
1903 2018-09-05 19:57:52 Arguments about hybrid systems being “more secure” only work from the perspective of “security by anything that sticks”. Cryptography and cryptocurrency should be held to a higher standard. Any consensus algorithm should be sufficient by itself and hybrids are snake oil at best.
1904 2018-09-05 19:57:38 Oh they are all nice ! then it’s the new acrylic I am liking! Sorry thought you had tried oil too. I used to paint in acrylic and had lots of fun with the layers of paint 
1905 2018-09-05 19:57:34 Look at that face. That’s the face of a woman who pays her mortgage selling vagina eggs and snake oil.
1906 2018-09-05 19:57:33 Join us on Thursday September 6th for Art Hop!

We will be located in downtown Fresno at 1814 "H" St from 6pm-10pm.

We will have a full range of our personal care products available for sale. Including soap, mustache wax, beard oil and pomade.
1907 2018-09-05 19:57:30 It's 100% not her. She leaves oil and nastiness errrywhere
1908 2018-09-05 19:57:24 Yo, when Duncan Mighty said ”If I break your heart, na oil spillage”, I felt that shit in my stomach as I laughed like a bastard 
1909 2018-09-05 19:57:18 Divert all Kenyan produced oil from Turkana in to Changamwe oil refinery and supply the refined product in to our local market !! No export-period!! #FuelShortage
1910 2018-09-05 19:57:11 Like the wildlife in the path of this pipeline, Trudeau knows better than most what it’s like to be completely submerged in big oil.
1911 2018-09-05 19:57:04 It's gonna be amazing! it'll also allow you to unlock Metroid maker and it'll have a secret chubby cherub mode! and if you make enough levels, it'll change the oil in your car and do your taxes!
1912 2018-09-05 19:56:55 Hoarding was expected as the oil marketers just realised that they were duped by the gov't in the 16%VAT on fuel. 
#FuelShortage
1913 2018-09-05 19:56:55 Mix it with baby oil. It adds a double layer and helps to trap and seal the moisture
1914 2018-09-05 19:56:52 I just bought a cool new Alienware PC  No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
1915 2018-09-05 19:56:37 Some Nerd: Women don’t play video games 
Me: *completely nude covered in coconut oil playing Stardew Valley* Eat your peppers Shane, u pepper whore, I love u
1916 2018-09-05 19:56:17 Gensol 5000 could offer your refinery or oil field a multitude of benefits. Let us provide you with a high-quality solution.
1917 2018-09-05 19:56:09 35 min for oil inventories
1918 2018-09-05 19:56:07 Their plan for expansion of oil sands emissions to 100Mt in 2030 has been calling their climate cred and fairness cred into question for a couple of years now.
1919 2018-09-05 19:56:02 And I gotta get an oil change too. Son of a bitch.
1920 2018-09-05 19:55:59 The secret to happiness is to see all the marvels of the world, and never to forget the drops of oil on the spoon.
1921 2018-09-05 19:55:55 Is it a chicken bone stuck in Brian Stelter's throat? I thought I heard some whale fat and snake oil gurgling around down there a few times. Must be a quite a collection of flotsam and jetsom down in that gullet.
1922 2018-09-05 19:55:36 They will pour palm oil and pepper on some ppl sef as if they are marinating him for burnt offering
1923 2018-09-05 19:55:32 My coconut oil was starting to solidify for a couple days and I saw a glimpse of fall then BAM  95° days struck back and now I’m sweating thru my shirt and all of the L train can see my nipples.
1924 2018-09-05 19:55:25 @JustinTrudeau Oil Companies won’t invest or are fleeing Alberta because of the quashed Trans Mountain Pipeline!Trudeau and the Liberals are  causing Alberta and Canada to go into a recession!
1925 2018-09-05 19:54:35 I saturate my scalp in coconut oil before I shampoo it bc I love myself.
1926 2018-09-05 19:54:34 The tension he lacked the difference between art already in bright, thick oil paints.
1927 2018-09-05 19:54:17 Me: *completely nude covered in coconut oil*
1928 2018-09-05 19:54:09 北海道全土停電も事象としてヤバいなあこれ。
1929 2018-09-05 19:54:06 My oil change yesterday cost $77. HOW?!
1930 2018-09-05 19:54:06 Border problems formed when the European Union began. We have all of the oil we need today.  Europe must import. International Monetary Fund went into countries to set up banking & deposing gov'ts for their natural resourses that our corps. wanted.
1931 2018-09-05 19:53:37 Aniyipixi baby oil bese nithi "glow up"  Lowkey like it though....
1932 2018-09-05 19:53:36 Voted for him. Doing it again. Little state, big balls.
1933 2018-09-05 19:53:35 Oil on the road ... we’re gonna crash.
1934 2018-09-05 19:53:20 Constitutional Textual originalitists are like men sitting in a boat taking on water with a bilge pump that needs oil, they know they’ll drown if they don’t add oil, but they refuse to add oil because the original instructions didn’t tell them when and how to add it.
1935 2018-09-05 19:53:16 Borrowing money during oil boom and borrowing money during recession, which one makes sense? Just asking!
1936 2018-09-05 19:53:14 Oooo ooooo I know!!! 
1937 2018-09-05 19:53:13 hmmmm tbh i Never notice any excessive shine on other people, i guess it's something people tend to overthink... oil on skin looks very natural honestly
1938 2018-09-05 19:53:06 I put beard oil in my hair & idk what I was thinking lmfao
1939 2018-09-05 19:52:50 Manufacturing will be a mirage with such oil prices, cost of production will go high, pushing price of local product, and since we import so much from China, their cheap products will have a field day in the country.
1940 2018-09-05 19:52:48 So now an average man can't work in an oil firm again cause he don't have connect.......just look at...........wasted.......
1941 2018-09-05 19:52:34 Not enough oil lol
1942 2018-09-05 19:52:24 You don't like or support oil in Canada, so why B.S. you and Rachel are so really, really happy the Trans Mountain pipeline is DEAD, Energy East DEAD,what's next
1943 2018-09-05 19:52:21 I'm starting to think you guys don't want crude oil on everything >:I
1944 2018-09-05 19:52:21 Olive oil game changers @Twitter! Loving today’s guest chef from McEvoy Ranch. First stop: back for seconds.  Second stop: farm tour! #sheinspiresme #McEvoyRanchTakesTwitter
1945 2018-09-05 19:52:06 Yes....to d corrupt, wicked and those that don't want the country to move forward and the citizens have a quality life expectant of an oil rich country.
1946 2018-09-05 19:52:06 It's an American company (Exxon) that discovered the oil. It will be an American company drilling, pumping, and selling it. It will be an American company mostly profiting. No need to invade. Job done already.
1947 2018-09-05 19:52:05 Well oiled?

Only in the sense that oil oligarchs are ruling behind the scenes.

They can’t even get a press release out without errors!
1948 2018-09-05 19:52:02 I accidentally bought CBD oil at the dispensary.. I am so sad 
1949 2018-09-05 19:52:02 That was before discovoring oil friend ، these pic. Just to remind us of our cultural heritage, if you  want to see the real  Arabic historical architectural  you have to visit Spain (Alandalus) our previous  occupied contry.
1950 2018-09-05 19:52:00 What is all this panic mode? Goats galore,oil revenue etc?
1951 2018-09-05 19:51:59 No 1 can help check prices of #Oil, #Gold, #Dollar. Be it #UPA=@INCIndia or NDA=@BJP4India Bcoz Globalization/Liberalization. Huge population's higher aspirations are the reason. @globaltimesnews @japantimes @BBCBreaking @cnnbrk @timesofindia @ttindia @htTweets @the_hindu
1952 2018-09-05 19:51:59 I have never been afraid of Russia. The Cheviot, the Stag and the Black Black Oil illustrated this very well
1953 2018-09-05 19:51:47 CBD oil has been shown to be a non-addictive option to codiene for treatment of migraines. It has also been shown to help in management of endometriosis. We have iboga here, a psychotic being researched in the west to treat drug addiction but all we do is ban

1962 2018-09-05 19:50:51 Nah dude I had tires that were like. Less than a year old. And I went to firestone for an oil change once and they literally told me my tires were almost bald and that I needed to buy new ones.
1963 2018-09-05 19:50:49 Gotta sit while I get a oil change 
1964 2018-09-05 19:50:47 Brakes, oil, tune up, then paint before the sale
1965 2018-09-05 19:50:46 si es No. 1499838, sería reprogramar para el día de mañana, por favor
1966 2018-09-05 19:50:37 Last week, NBS reported a soft GDP growth print of 1.5% y/y weaker than most analysts myself included expected. Main drag stemmed from oil which contracted and agriculture which grew at its slowest pace since 1987 and trade which remained in recession. Telecomms rose 11.5%
1967 2018-09-05 19:50:28 Gold,oil and drugs
1968 2018-09-05 19:50:26 As a still highly paid ex oil executive, living in a palace, who works for an organisation with one of the largest property portfolios, how about you shut up, or stand for election as an MP, on your beliefs.
1969 2018-09-05 19:50:25 I vote yes.
1970 2018-09-05 19:50:00 To prep the Emperor Bulblax tongue for cooking, marinate in olive oil and chop into cubes.

1975 2018-09-05 19:49:43 but it was magic. Whisky turned to honey. vodka to oil. #HalalMagic
1976 2018-09-05 19:49:40 Artikeln är lika trovärdig som en pressrelease från cassandra oil.
1977 2018-09-05 19:49:24 Phenomenal story.. Now get yer’ ass back into the Lucas Oil one way or another now that #BigRigGrig is gone. Keep up the good work and positive in the city! #iheardB.Lameyretired 
1978 2018-09-05 19:49:23 Save the orangutans! Tell palm oil regulator @RSPOtweets to sanction @Indofood, the rogue #palmoil company that fuels destruction of rainforests & precious orangutan habitat
1979 2018-09-05 19:49:16 There’s a blockbuster of a Netflix box set in Mayo GAA. They could call it, “The Exexutive”. On and off the field woes, power struggles, greed, firings, resignations, and for the sake of drama they could create some kind of a love interest. A bit like Dallas but without the oil.
1980 2018-09-05 19:49:13 <みなさんにとっての"オイル"とは何ですか⁇
1981 2018-09-05 19:49:10 Make sure the CBD oil is derived from Marijuana, and not from hemp.  Hemp derived CBD oil is garbage. Not worth the price.
1982 2018-09-05 19:49:08 Is there State intervention for oil companies?
1983 2018-09-05 19:49:07 WRONG. Are you working for a US oil company?
1984 2018-09-05 19:48:59 #Oil prices in India. It's is easy for govts to say that taxes can't be reduced, as it may lead to a catastrophic situation @ncbn, @PMOIndia, @arunjaitley. People are disgusted with both state & central govts. Forthcoming elections will reflect govts' folly on oil issue?
1985 2018-09-05 19:48:54 Being a new ingredient to the UK, nor can we relay details to the public about CBD Oil’s relevant scientific There’s plenty of info explaining the why CBD has gained huge popularity. Please google who cbd or join our Facebook forum for further info. Thanks Louise@Healthspan
1986 2018-09-05 19:48:52 How many oil tankers do you dock on the coast now?  How many spills since they started arriving?  You and those like you only ant enough oil to keep you comfy.  BC buys Saudi oil while the rest of Canada struggles to stay in the world market? You are damn selfish.
1987 2018-09-05 19:48:49 you know it’s cold again when your coconut oil solidifies
1988 2018-09-05 19:48:35 Need my ends clipped & a hot oil treatment but these braids seem so much simpler 
1989 2018-09-05 19:48:21 The shortest route is 20km, ~8x length of Queensferry Crossing, north channel is much deeper, and this would need 100’s of km road upgrades to get to. Other option is twice as far! Widest Norwegian fjord they plan to bridge is 5km. And they have a vast oil fund to pay for it.
1990 2018-09-05 19:48:18 Duncan mighty really said “If i break you heart na oil spillage” had to delete that song mehn
1991 2018-09-05 19:47:59 hope my daddy tryna get my oil changed.
1992 2018-09-05 19:47:52 Cooking coconut oil all over my body...!
1993 2018-09-05 19:47:49 Isn't kerosene also some type of bio fuel? 
I mean at one point it was plankton then crude oil until it got refined into rp-1
So dinosaurs help you getting into space ...
1994 2018-09-05 19:47:38 Man of oil x Animal Collective
1995 2018-09-05 19:47:29 in other news, tea tree oil has been great for my skin
1996 2018-09-05 19:47:19 I won’t take any Uduaghan Slander. I chop inside the Governor largesse  But trust me Delta for an oil producing state is so backward.
1997 2018-09-05 19:47:15 My boyfriend is fixing cars today, Oil changes are $20 breaks & tune ups $40. He also knows how to do a lot of other things as well, Inbox me for any other questions.

Serious Inquires Only 
1998 2018-09-05 19:47:13 Hi Darren. Fortunately we operate in a heavily regulated industry with no room for misleading promises. Part of the legislation we firmly abide by means at present we cannot make health claims for CBD Oil.
1999 2018-09-05 19:47:05 I don't agree that Peterson's main goal is to help people. I see him as a snake oil salesman who's trying to take advantage of desperate people for fame and fortune. He's even sending them to his daughter for 80$ alternative medicine consultations. He's not a rational figure imo.
2000 2018-09-05 19:47:05 Actually that shit is mostly sugar & oil w a dusting of chocolate & the perfume of hazelnut
2001 2018-09-05 19:47:04 Canada, like Australia, will be able to service global commodity demand (Canada: oil; Australia: coal) at no-growth levels for years to come. But yeah, it won’t be a fun business to be in at all. Both countries need to find new mission statements.
2002 2018-09-05 19:46:55 OPEC & industry sources:  Saudi Arabia wants oil to stay between $70 & $80 a barrel until after U.S. congressional elections,allowing adequate profits,but keeping prices moderate.
2003 2018-09-05 19:46:54 My co worker “Bro one time this girl made me put on a leather mask, then she pulled out this rack with some toys and oil. The only thing I could do in that situation was pray” 
Me: LMFAO!!!!!! 
2004 2018-09-05 19:46:35 And the bottles found with him conatins honey and olive oil
2005 2018-09-05 19:46:23 Want a clear conscience while tucking into your @Nestle @PepsiCo & @KFC? Then first tell palm oil regulator @RSPOtweets to suspend disgraced #palmoil company @Indofood
2006 2018-09-05 19:46:20 Kämpa @svtnyheter! Inte ett ord om Schori eller transportstyrelsen före valet! Nu kämpas det för anslagen och socialismen! Lundin Oil nästa? Kanske Ådalen kan få folket på bättre tankar?
2007 2018-09-05 19:46:17 What the country that makes all it's money from Oil and VW who lied about emissions and are about to be bankrupted by $TSLA denied it?  Shocking!
2008 2018-09-05 19:46:04 Thank you sir for speaking out for the voiceless.
Those running the United nations Organization are corrupt to the core. They care about oil deals with ruthless dictators in Africa like Paul Biya of French Cameroun at the expense of human lives.
2009 2018-09-05 19:45:59 Donald having trouble selling tickets to your snake oil salesman show?
2010 2018-09-05 19:45:40 Palm oil body @RSPOtweets has delayed deciding whether to kick #palmoil villain Indofood out for two years now. I want them to take action sooner!
2011 2018-09-05 19:45:36 [getting oil changed]

Me: yeah, the works. If you see something that needs fixing, fix it.

Mechanic, looking serious: Keystone.

Me: What are you doing?

Mechanic, opening arms: Keystone.
2012 2018-09-05 19:45:31 @TheDeadSecrets J’accuse Myrtle. The oil is for polishing her dummy, and she dunnit because Dusty Fields was having an affair with the dummy
2013 2018-09-05 19:45:25 Ferdinandsen and Run Like Hell (Die Hölle)
Rudolf Benca
Oil on color
2014 2018-09-05 19:45:24 Both correct. My sister has used the oil quite a bit and it seems to work well for her fibromyalgia.
2015 2018-09-05 19:45:23 Yes!! Coconut oil too 
2016 2018-09-05 19:45:20 CUP NEEDA OIL CHANGE
2017 2018-09-05 19:45:19 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
2018 2018-09-05 19:45:13 Ok so I’m getting an oil change right and I still have a half of a tacobell burrito and BRUH if someone takes that I’m gonna be heated.
2019 2018-09-05 19:45:07 Economic diversification nake so. Is high time we rely on oil only  
2020 2018-09-05 19:45:02 Unfortunately, my Senators have oil company logos tattooed on their chests: @tedcruz and @JohnCornyn
2021 2018-09-05 19:44:56 Possible oil was on hands that could do it, rash sometimes takes longer to show up on different areas, reason people think rash spreads due to contact with other areas
2022 2018-09-05 19:44:56 Hi guys, is High Oleic Sunflower Oil on the ok list of oils? 
I believe reg sunflower oil is not, but what is "high oleic"?
2023 2018-09-05 19:44:45 they shouldn’t be doing much for an inspection bby, just making sure everything is working correctly but if you need an oil change or anything when you’re home in Wilson I work at Valvoline on Forest Hills rd and I can make sure you get good service without feeling uncomfortable
2024 2018-09-05 19:44:37 @TheDeadSecrets the dummy did it. The oil is what is used to keep her joints loosened. She has developed a hatred for Myrtle, jealous that she cannot have a life of her own so she's framed Myrtle. I think she's tired of the trunk.
2025 2018-09-05 19:44:24 Where do you get an oil pen?
2026 2018-09-05 19:44:23 1. I'm currently undergoing a background check and there are some things you just don't put on Facebook.
2. Mostly for the shirtless, oiled scenes, like in Turkish oil wrestling (see #1).
&c.
2027 2018-09-05 19:44:23 Everything you've said is doable, just requires dedication etc. Qxtn is will it ever be a priority for whoever is in power? They'll say there are other things of high importance - infrastructure, agriculture, oil.....
2028 2018-09-05 19:44:18 Raw materials, extraction, energy production, transport -- all of it.  Your expensive gadgets wouldn't exist without fossil fuels.  You wouldn't have food on your table without fossil fuels. If you think you don't use oil -- and plenty of it -- you're fooling yourself.
2029 2018-09-05 19:43:53 And his duty will be to refill the teil(oil) bottles for keyboards 
2030 2018-09-05 19:43:52 True you're right, salt and pepper goes a LONG way esp with some olive oil 
2031 2018-09-05 19:43:51 Walnut oil
2032 2018-09-05 19:43:49 if you oil it the best time is after you strain it!

2036 2018-09-05 19:43:39 I'm sure he'll have some real informed, insightful thoughts to share on the current state of play in the oil industry...
2037 2018-09-05 19:43:36 Good to know! I've been mixing my tea tree oil with mine for a minute.
2038 2018-09-05 19:43:36 Trying to b healthy and he gives me crap about getting proper measuring cups and spoons at a dollar general. Just trying to make my low carb muffins in a cup. Avacado Oil was 12 a small container butter be good muffins! #lowcarb
2039 2018-09-05 19:43:27 True absurdity, thank his lucky stars for the gas and oil boom.
2040 2018-09-05 19:43:23 Time for an oil change... oooh, lordy! ＼(＾O＾)／
2041 2018-09-05 19:42:45 I hope #CJP will take notice of @iqrarulhassan programme and order inquiry into what exactly happened with those bottles of honey and oil, astonishing revelations, Great work Iqrar Bhai.
2042 2018-09-05 19:42:44 基本的に彼女と喧嘩したときは9割りくらい僕が悪い場合が多いのですぐ謝るようにしてる．彼女おらんけど
2043 2018-09-05 19:42:33 Let's distinguish. Companies like REIT, fracking/shale oil, Netflix and FB of FANG, etc. look overvalued to me
2044 2018-09-05 19:42:30 Noooooooo!!!!!  I bought this stuff that’s supposed to have a smell they don’t like. Peppermint oil was working, it was just getting expensive.
2045 2018-09-05 19:42:14 "See my pants full, ‘cos I ball big
Always hitting the spot like an oil rig..."
2046 2018-09-05 19:42:11 Military bearing is a joke in your definition of it. Nazi Germany follower orders without question, you suggest we do the same? Bury our morals in the name of oil and money?
2047 2018-09-05 19:41:56 $SU holding off on further crude oil production expansions until there is more clarity on when new pipelines in Canada will be ready
2048 2018-09-05 19:41:55 yes that looks right to me. I have Jets, Preds, Blues and Avs in the Central. and Ducks, Kings, Knights, Sharks as top 4 in West. Battle for wildcard is really Avs, Blues, Sharks, Flames, Stars, Wild, Hawks. Oil, Nucks and Yotes have a ways to go.
2049 2018-09-05 19:41:48 Once Kavanaugh gets confirmed, you’ll have to wait and see if “handmaid” is on the approved female attire list, before making the decision.
2050 2018-09-05 19:41:33 So Warren, a country electing to have an NEP is a viable sovereign right.  The U.S. has one, famously Norway has one, as do almost all oil producing nations, how do you explain ours ours as so toxic?  
Or were we not seeing the full picture bec. of bias local punditry?
2051 2018-09-05 19:41:29 Went to one natural herb/oil place today first time buying raw black cumin seeds so potent and its for life as it survives in the desert
2052 2018-09-05 19:41:29 Hee oil is that even possible  a ID at a bank
2053 2018-09-05 19:41:27 any nigga can build a house, it take special skill for him to use the dropper to put oil in my scalp in between braids without getting the shit in my eyes tho.

2058 2018-09-05 19:40:54 they should reroute to South Soudan only...hoping SSudan will solely transport their abundant oil  through Mombasa Port
2059 2018-09-05 19:40:51 Don't provoke a man that takes fish oil supplements.
2060 2018-09-05 19:40:51 I adore oil paintings

2062 2018-09-05 19:40:47 Tropical Storm Gordon made landfall just west of the Alabama-Mississippi border,so oil prices reversed from earlier this week when dozens of U.S. oil & gas platforms were shut in anticipation of impending disruption.
2063 2018-09-05 19:40:44 Trouble in the oil patch? Halliburton's earnings warning has investors spooked. $HAL falls 6%. $OIH oil services ETF down more than 2%.

2071 2018-09-05 19:40:09 What’s Edo state’s business with developing a port, refinery, or industrial park? What’s the technical competence of the state? Who is talking to shipping lines to move their businesses to the port? Who will operate the port? What oil & gas competence do they have for a refinery?
2072 2018-09-05 19:40:06 My dads worked in car industry for majority of his life yet it’s me and mum that ends up putting oil in engine... how’s that work 
2073 2018-09-05 19:40:04 Family Nutrition: Cool #Whip this September? Its first three #ingredients are water, hydrogenated oil and High Fructose Corn Syrup!

Is an oil change supposed to take over AN HOUR!?
2079 2018-09-05 19:38:51 Ladies, if your eye lashes are short but want them to grow there are 3 tips that helped me.  
1. Castor Oil  
2. Coconut oil 
3. Vaseline 
Spend less on extensions and go Natural with the same results
2080 2018-09-05 19:38:45 I’m an Alberta Oil Patch worker and we are tested on dangerous gases and concentrations. I was thinking about your risk of cumulative effects. I had to leave a job and I was not well for quite a while from cumulative effects.
2081 2018-09-05 19:38:43 He is not changing the oil. That came later.
2082 2018-09-05 19:38:40 Tropical Storm Gordon made landfall just west of the Alabama-Mississippi border,so oil prices reversed a strong when dozens of U.S. oil & gas platforms were shut in anticipation of the impending disruption.

2091 2018-09-05 19:37:52 The escalators do not work. The aircon bust. The lifts smelled of oil and grease. Add the visible doors that are locked and obscure doors used for access. It is a nightmare.

2096 2018-09-05 19:37:34 wooooooow. I seldom make Italian food because I feel like I need to overdo the olive oil to get the right texture, and idk why I didn’t switch to butter since that’s usually my answer in every other recipe 
2097 2018-09-05 19:37:32 @PeaceNaturals how often is your stock replenished? We are trying to order specific products but doesn't seem to be in stock. #clearviewK DF & #raphael oil
2098 2018-09-05 19:37:29 That bullshit was done for the oil companies and the capitalist it had nothing to do with protecting our freedom,

how is helping the Saudis drop made-in-usa bombs on a bus for the school children in Yemen protecting our freedom

Trump: they know what they're signing up for
2099 2018-09-05 19:37:14 Your fuel pump could be bad need oil change or gas tank is dirty go to auto zone or local gas station for fuel injections

2101 2018-09-05 19:36:58 It was a long time ago. I know Molly Ivins also blamed the fact that Clayton Williams told people he hadn't paid taxes after the oil bust (because he had losses on his oil investments), and she said that put him out of touch with Texans.
2102 2018-09-05 19:36:56 My West Virginia Facebook feed has caused me to hit the CBD oil hard
2103 2018-09-05 19:36:38 "We should've taken their oil" Our idiot President will finally get his war.
2104 2018-09-05 19:36:27 Don’t stress yourself about the hair hun. It will grow. Castor oil is what I’ve used since she was born. Recently introduced @PurpulHair spray n oil(certain days). The hair is soft n manageable. I don’t wash it daily but I spray it with aloe daily then apply the oils.
2105 2018-09-05 19:36:17 You want to bankrupt this country. Why do you and people of your ilk insist on killing the golden goose! No other major energy producing country signed onto the Paris accord! Saudi Arabia? Nigeria? Russia? Or Canada… Who would you rather get your oil from ??

2107 2018-09-05 19:36:14 @Francis_Lam Remembering your super easy pasta with fresh tomatoes recipe: chopped tomatoes with salt in a bowl, let it sit, make and strain pasta, add to bowl with herbs, more salt and olive oil?
2108 2018-09-05 19:35:57 My buddy over at @cbdaily_oil making it happen in the industry, some great innovation in pain management for sure!
2109 2018-09-05 19:35:49 Ramen has lots of oil so I don't really like it.
2110 2018-09-05 19:35:45 Come out on Saturday from 1-4pm at Minto Park on the corner of Elgin and Gilmour! 

Make some art to encourage the folks fighting on the frontlines against KM & Line 3. 
Come tell @JustinTrudeau why climate leaders don’t profit off the oil industry.

2112 2018-09-05 19:35:42 Limitation is because of panic buying! You remember the cooking oil issue? We panicked and purchased excess coz of 'news of looming shortage'   My family is still using the cooking oil I panickly purchased then.

2121 2018-09-05 19:34:14 It's funny how all these politicians scream about the rule of law until it turns against them. I think it's time to re-start the consultation process. Alberta shouldn't care, the price of oil should increase in a few years if it's approved. #Alberta @JustinTrudeau @RachelNotley

2125 2018-09-05 19:34:06 Summary: we can have our cake and eat it too (ie we can build an oil pipeline and do so in a way that satisfies all the anti-oil / anti-pipeline / anti-Alberta activists). I hope, despite all the evidence to the contrary, that he's right.
2126 2018-09-05 19:33:58 Basically (@JesuisNaija ) saying we outlaw stuff and miss their other benefits. CBD oil is now sold over the counter in the UK. It's benefits have been shown even in autistic children. Understanding the components of hemp is easy esp the THC & CBD.
2127 2018-09-05 19:33:51 Fuel transporters have crippled the oil industry. What if public transport, workers and the fence-sitting balcony-watching middle class join in a nationwide protest? Will the anti-people government still chest-thump? Till then, it's wishful thinking.
2128 2018-09-05 19:33:46 My face is like an oil spill girl
2129 2018-09-05 19:33:43 Lead me to salvation pour that oil please
2130 2018-09-05 19:33:22 Oil changes are fun. Bills and staph meetings though, those have to go.
2131 2018-09-05 19:33:21 Their economy heavily relied on oil prices. When it went down in 2014, so did Venezuela's economy. The Maduro regime controlling people who demanded basic human rights led to economic sanctions. The Trump Saudi oil deal was the nail in the coffin. Learn to spell, read, etc fishy1
2132 2018-09-05 19:33:12 some oil baron probably paid him 10 million dollars to come play Ice Ice Baby at his son's birthday.

Might as well make fun of you. Not like evidence changes your mind. You are a shining example of the good an education could have done, if only.

2140 2018-09-05 19:32:05 #ArunJaitley Why doesn’t Govt give Subsidy to Oil Companies to protect consumers from rising Petro prices? Is it because  Reliance is a Pvt company and is not entitled to Subsidy? And corrupt BJP Govt is sacrificing people’s interest to serve Ambani?
2141 2018-09-05 19:31:58 She seemed to not dispute the commonly owned premise, one reason for banning them. Her position was, most people owning them do not use them. Illogical for sure

2145 2018-09-05 19:31:44 Lol! People don’t like it cause of its texture (it’s a little slimy????) but it’s soooooo good when paired with tomatoes and lightly pan cooked in olive oil. 

I eat it at work.
2146 2018-09-05 19:31:38 thanks

There is only about £3.3bn (uk oil/gas tax) collected up to tax year 79/80 which might equate to circa £20bn at todays prices? 

So that would not get up to Mackays £333bn figure, but at least its similarish ballpark.
2147 2018-09-05 19:31:22 which makes sense since the low carb levels are a therapeutic tool for treating IR which is likely caused by some combination of long term processed grain oil & processed sugar exposure.
2148 2018-09-05 19:31:19 Well normally it isn’t as extravagant as all of year new pop up restaurants are making it. It’s just raw diced tuna in oil and a few toppings. I really like it!
2149 2018-09-05 19:31:16 Not basing exonomy in oil fields at all oil is a bonus we have many other natural resources

2157 2018-09-05 19:30:33 Olive oil on the skin. 
You can garlic and herbify the oil for tasty crunchyness.
2158 2018-09-05 19:30:33 I would be very interested in having you over to Ireland to help educate people about the health benefits of Cannabis. The stigma must stop, jailing people for use of a herb is draconian. I don’t smoke, but I would use the oil if I could. I use CBD and find it great for pain

2164 2018-09-05 19:30:02 Natural hair disasters: I used a new product, mixed it with oil. When my hair dried, it left a white dandruff-like residue in my hair #YAY
2165 2018-09-05 19:30:02 Hot tip of the day: be diligent about checking and changing your car's oil. No single step will help an engine last longer than reg. oil and oil filter changes. Conversely, nothing will destroy an engine faster than neglecting to check/change the oil. #paypermile #Metromile
2166 2018-09-05 19:29:55 Eish Sne . Don’t worry. We will beautify them. . Start using Castor Oil or Purpul Hair oil together with their aloe spray. @PurpulHair @2uli
2167 2018-09-05 19:29:24 Dispersants are horrible for people and marine life. They would've been better off collecting what oil they could and letting bacteria eat the rest.
2168 2018-09-05 19:29:21 how does this prove you are being suppressed? what makes you so special that you should always be included in top for oott? and what is "conservative" about copy and pasting oil headlines?
2169 2018-09-05 19:29:20 Palm oil body @RSPOtweets has delayed deciding whether to kick #palmoil villain Indofood out for two years now. I want them to take action sooner!
2170 2018-09-05 19:29:18 I would LOVE to do oil painting because I adore the style of the old masters but you're right there's just never time!
2171 2018-09-05 19:29:02 I recently started painting in pastels (oil and soft) its been an eye opening experience and I have been loving every minute of it. been keeping it abstract lately but thinking of doing some nerdy #atc real soon.
2172 2018-09-05 19:28:49 The unstated purpose of these so-called environmental reviews is not to protect the environment per se, but to stop all future pipelines, nay, to stop all oil development.  We know what you are up to!
2173 2018-09-05 19:28:48 A cat/bottle of vodka/candy/oil diffuser/poetry and SF books
2174 2018-09-05 19:28:26 Idk why fish and shrimp is not considered as a choice of meat but i eat those two to replace the meat. Baked or grilled no butter (olive oil) I’ve been eating vegetables, fruit, smoothies etc i did it before i was pregnant... it gets easier each day! Try it!
2175 2018-09-05 19:28:25 Apparently, in order to have this Pope take the pedophile problem seriously you would have to catch a priest in the act of molesting a migrant child with a plastic straw in a gas station bathroom while on his way to celebrate mass on an oil rig in the gulf.
2176 2018-09-05 19:28:19 Question is, what motor oil does he run on?
2177 2018-09-05 19:28:15 All of those things use oil.
2178 2018-09-05 19:28:15 Now ERC has just cancelled a license to one oil marketer who was demonstrating about the fuel levy. Dictatorial regulator.
2179 2018-09-05 19:28:14 will be second only to the hysteria after Mueller report doesn't implicate Trump
2180 2018-09-05 19:28:13 my daddy found a coupon for me to get my oil changed  guess who won’t be paying $55
2181 2018-09-05 19:27:54 I agree. Lets see how the day closes but I have 82 area marked for reference...
10am we get a FOMC Williams and Oil numbers as well. Should be turbulent though...
2182 2018-09-05 19:27:40 Of course we need. How can the "poisoned mind" of a @HarvardChanSPH @HarvardHealth professor be allowed to market CONola CRISCO indirectly?. Coconut Oil bashing started with P&G's first man made TRANS FAT which all these so called experts forced everyone to eat.
2183 2018-09-05 19:27:33 Linseed oil.
2184 2018-09-05 19:27:31 Went to get an oil change and ended up spending $200 on my car
2185 2018-09-05 19:27:23 And have you seen their claims? Astonishing that people are so naive and yet spend lots of money for IV snake oil. And how sad that any doctors or nurses involved haven’t been reported to GMC or GNC for giving non evidence based treatments. @mgtmccartney
2186 2018-09-05 19:27:23 Your hair is constantly greasy or wet because you just washed it cause it was greasy. It is greasy because you wash it every day, stripping the natural oils used to keep your hair healthy. Your scalp produces twice as much oil to balance out. Yur greasy we can all tell, bruh 
2187 2018-09-05 19:27:22 My grandpa can yell and be bitchy all he wants, but I love him and I’m just gonna say hi how are you and move on. The relationship is oil and water.
2188 2018-09-05 19:27:20 I just made a turkey burger using cannabis oil
2189 2018-09-05 19:27:09 lol...it was a few million years ago these fossil fuels started cooking up from giant jungles and animal/ insect life that died and rotted into oil/natural gas... the extra co2 is allowing vegetation to thrive again...oil sands largest recovery clean up in human history
2190 2018-09-05 19:27:08 Yum! Just waiting to be roasted with some olive oil and sea salt! 
2191 2018-09-05 19:27:06 Yeah. Raises really interesting questions about power supply. Iran definitely less reliant on natural gas and especially oil product imports than earlier this decade, but... Would be argument for further increases in power costs, though timing politically difficult.
2192 2018-09-05 19:26:58 Are they slip resistant? Oil resistant? Non conductive? Steel toe?
2193 2018-09-05 19:26:49 I was in my office today at Church when I got a call I was told that our Revial in Canda has to get some more permits. Do to the fact we are importing some Bibles and Anointing oil. There lab wants to run test on the anointing oil. Ok that is no problem. WOW. GGA
2194 2018-09-05 19:26:40 Agreed! That’s why the CCTV cameras are messed up to prevent anyone from seeing who spilled the oil esp in such an obscure place.
2195 2018-09-05 19:26:34 I’m telling you. Get you one of those mask things from Walmart. With some oil from Dr.Teal and they milk bag soap. It be lit!!
2196 2018-09-05 19:26:25 Oh that didn't work what about this essential oil GO TO A DOCTOR
2197 2018-09-05 19:26:25 Plenty of Giants Stadium nostalgia to be had tonight as RB2 play on crisp, bright Indianapolis Colts football lines and logos at Lucas Oil Stadium tonight. 

And yeah, some faint yellow soccer lines in there too.
2198 2018-09-05 19:26:14 Lavender or tea tree oil and certain supplements such as Dong Quai and Tribulus terrestris have also been associated with #gynecomastia.
2199 2018-09-05 19:26:09 Keep your face clean. Whether or not you have acne, it's important to wash your face twice daily to remove impurities, dead skin cells, and extra oil from your skin's surface. #acne #pimples #blemish #Zits
2200 2018-09-05 19:25:58 not a great question at all. sometimes you have to grow up and act in the face of ignorance. we don't know what will replace fossil fuels. but we don't have a choice. we have to start putting oil companies out of business, now.
2201 2018-09-05 19:25:43 What does “sustainable” palm oil certifier @RSPOtweets have to do with worker exploitation? It still hasn’t condemned shameless #palmoil company @Indofood. It’s time to force @Nestle & @PepsiCo’s business partner out of the market!
2202 2018-09-05 19:25:29 Dr. Patrick should we adults also supplement with fish oil (omega 3 tablets)?
2203 2018-09-05 19:25:29 oil slick upper, gum sole?
2204 2018-09-05 19:25:27 What Trudeau really means is Let’s Build that Trans Mountain Pipeline so we can send MORE oil to Asia!
2205 2018-09-05 19:25:20 A very long time ago.. I uploaded two versions of a mountain valley on my DA account. One version is an oil painting while the other is a mosaic. Would you be willing to buy them as photo prints, postcards, coasters, or magnets? (Use the poll to answer)
2206 2018-09-05 19:25:16 When you pour it in the oil and hear "gbasssssss"
2207 2018-09-05 19:25:07 Yes, the EV category I use—and which has become more common—is PHEV+EV, but it excludes non-plug-in hybrids. In the Oil Fall series, this is the category I use now.

2210 2018-09-05 19:24:47 Also good with black bean salsa: black beans, coriander, onion, lime, olive oil, tomato. The salsa goes good with Mexican breakfast burrito, or some grilled salmon.
2211 2018-09-05 19:24:44 Butts and Trudeau are cheering this. Less oil and less  power for Albertans.
2212 2018-09-05 19:24:40 Ïndustrially Partially and or Fully Hydrogenated or Both, Oil fed Rats tends to be rather frot tasting and a dire Health issue.

2213 2018-09-05 19:24:38 And for the record folks, my father was a driller. Started working in the west Texas oil patch when he was 14 years old. My late husband was a pulling unit Operator for years before he got into sales and service. Fuck clutching my pearls over a few well placed swear words.
2214 2018-09-05 19:24:27 The State Department is brazenly saying that it would give exemptions to the oil sanctions, the answer was all that was hard and hard to do, remember that I had a serious illness, and yet I helped you, why do I have to tell these words among the people.

2216 2018-09-05 19:24:20 Ridiculing gold? Every week I write that gold is money, and ridicule the idea that money can be measured in falling/failing paper credit notes.

Also, the assertion that an oil futures contract makes the yuan gold backed. The same could be said for the USD--since 1970s.
2217 2018-09-05 19:24:12 literally?!? a lot of them be like “the moment” then bitch get the morning after oil or smth
2218 2018-09-05 19:24:12 Of course a simple oil change turns into brake work and realignment costing nearly $600 ... Oh Toyota ...
2219 2018-09-05 19:24:05 Non-regulated electricity income. Not oil (which won't be part of Nalcor in the near future anyway).
2220 2018-09-05 19:24:00 The USA has offered Prof. Dr Sharjeel Memon the chairmanship of U.S National Research Council after witnessing a successful experiment of converting Brandy into Honey and Vodka into Olive oil. He has also been shortlisted for Nobel Prize in Chemistry.

2221 2018-09-05 19:23:52 So apparently they’ll have my her another week. When they went to drain the fluid there was metal in my oil. Who did my last oil change oh the dealer. 

Guess who gets a brand new transmission FOR FREE AND they’re paying for the car I drowned. LOOK AT GAWD!!!!
2222 2018-09-05 19:23:39 that could also mean power exports etc. But most likely it is oil/gas cash.

2229 2018-09-05 19:22:56 I've recently become quite curious about the use of cannabinoids (CBD oil in particular, preferably without any THC) to alleviate period pain, a.k.a. dysmenorrhea.
2230 2018-09-05 19:22:51 Venezuelans, in a country with huge oil reserves, are queuing to buy fuel. I'm always shocked when government’s want to turn economics on its head.

2247 2018-09-05 19:21:36 Their economy heavily relied on oil prices. When it went down in 2014, so did Venezuela's economy. The Maduro regime controlling people who demanded basic human rights led to economic sanctions. The Trump Saudi oil deal was the final nail in the coffin. Sorry  @thedaltonmonkey

Now finding any good projects online is very difficult for companies and individuals.

Elance's owners invested in Oil & Gas.

So actually the main business was from US.

2285 2018-09-05 19:17:49 And if domestic Canadian oil price was artificially low the arbitrage opportunity would vanish it. Even if there was a slight increase in domestic oil price the stronger CAD would work too offset any food price increases. 2/2

2306 2018-09-05 19:16:00 #Nicaragua doesn’t have oil. We don’t have oil. US interest is a matter of national security, our government is head of drug dealers and terrorists and an ally of Cuba. That’s not good for US to have a government like that so near their interests.
2307 2018-09-05 19:15:57 RBS? Is that yon bank thats 78% owned by UK treasury? Considering most of our fish and whisky goes abroad I dont see that being a problem. Big problem comes when England realise they need our oil, electricity and water.
2308 2018-09-05 19:15:48 I wonder if the feeling of needing to call my dad to tell him I got an oil change will ever go away. Like am I gonna be 40 and call him to brag about how I had the general maintenance done on my car so he’s proud?

2320 2018-09-05 19:14:45 Don't think that's how it works. Canada imports 50% of its oil consumption meaning we're paying the market price already. Canadian oil production is priced on WTI a continental benchmark so maybe there's a slight discount but it would be small 1/2
2321 2018-09-05 19:14:41 Its only a democracy as much as it has voting. Its only a republic as much as they rape children and star wars for oil. I country is what it does, not what it says.

2326 2018-09-05 19:14:10 What about when "society' (ie the government) sells the property or leases it to an individual.  The oil has no value in the ground and the socialists need the capitalists to extract it in order to produce wealth for them to hand out.

2338 2018-09-05 19:13:31 I came to get my oil change not to be harassed and no I promise you don’t know me so LEAVE ME ALONE. 
2339 2018-09-05 19:13:14 We’ll still need oil in the near future! Isn’t just cars that need oil. Where do you think plastic is made from, just a small example!
2340 2018-09-05 19:13:04 Coal is still heavily used in non-nuclear thermal power plants and steel mills b/c it is abundant and is also relatively cheaper than oil.
In addition, coal liquefaction process allows to get liquid fuel from coal.
The only problem is, someone has to go down and carry them out.

2347 2018-09-05 19:12:37 Why is the chick on the right wearing a 45 record adapter?
2348 2018-09-05 19:12:34 The pipeline isn't for Canadian to use oil. It's to send it overseas.
2349 2018-09-05 19:12:32 We’re bringing in a lot of new products this Fall!  We’ve had a few requests so here they are.  We are now offering Ear Candles (regular, beeswax and herbal) along with Mullein Ear Oil.  Offered in pairs or in bulk.
2350 2018-09-05 19:12:24 Shouldn’t you have some oil derricks in the background for Zinke?
2351 2018-09-05 19:12:21 Gotcha. How about slice in half, drizzle olive oil and roast on a cookie sheet for 10 minutes. You could then toss them in a frittata with cheese or smash them on bread for bruschetta.
2352 2018-09-05 19:12:10 So I tried the wet & wild photo focus foundation for the first time today and it lasted ALL day! No oil coming through, still looked beautiful, and its £6!! My Kat Von D foundation is £28 and you could cook an egg on my face by the end of the day #wigsnatched

2355 2018-09-05 19:11:49 Once a pipeline gets built by its own travelling pipebuilding crews, & scant local labour, there's sweet F.A. for jobs after the oil starts flowing. 
 Maybe as much as a Safeway.
Not making many good paying jobs in Canada, sending a raw product to foreign soil to be refined.

2359 2018-09-05 19:11:07 There is some confusion that environmentalists have co-opted the first Nations in their idealistic fight against carbon. Hurting them with Western supporters of the oil sands. Is that what nathan is? If so a big gap needs closing.
2360 2018-09-05 19:11:05 Even better, get a countertop convection oven. Will time toast your bagels and so much more! Makes delish roasted carrots in a cast iron pot, 400 for 1 hour, salt and olive oil, try to remember to stir once around the middle.

Trudeau- "I will still import their oil and sell them military hardware to commit human rights abuses"

2367 2018-09-05 19:10:26 #Venezuela's reserves are down to $8.3 billion and its only source of dollars, oil production, has fallen to the 1947 level. In this context, the White House should resist any reckless intervention to topple Maduro, despite presidential impatience and Sen. Rubio's goading.

2397 2018-09-05 19:07:39 America's actual involvement in WW1 was mostly rearguard support allowing UK & French troops to face German soldiers 'fresh' from the Eastern Front.

And supplying oil - as Churchill had modernised much of the Navy to oil-powered ships at the outset of war.
2398 2018-09-05 19:07:36 You need Eucalyptus oil as well.

2405 2018-09-05 19:06:30 Russia is setting up on Ukraine's border (again). You said it was Obama's fault that Putin took Crimea. Are you going to do anything about it this time, or has Putin told you to stay the hell out of his way. Perhaps he's promised you a share of his oil money.

2407 2018-09-05 19:06:22 You know #firstnations deal with Ottawa on a nation to nation basis, not a fake 'majority' basis, right? You know that using LESS oil is better and attacking people for having limited choices is garbage zero-sum logic, right? You know there's no market in Asia for bitumen, right?
2408 2018-09-05 19:06:22 that's over 150 years in the future so you won't need to worry....we have the 3rd largest reserve of untapped oil in the world... go back to hugging the trees that are growing 4x faster than normal with the added carbon in the air
2409 2018-09-05 19:06:20 Making those illegal oil deals that benefit Russia

2415 2018-09-05 19:05:51 They have been saying that for forty years. The truth is rather the reverse:- as oil becomes more scarce, the value rises. 
Please go ahead indy Scotland; it would be the crowning misfortune for alt-right Leavers who thought Brexit would divide the EU and unite the UK.
2416 2018-09-05 19:05:50 Sure. Let’s tariff Canadian oil! 
We can always buy oil imports from our dear Saudi friends instead.
Any why do we need Canadian parts for our cars? We can just stop making cars.
And who cares about the fact that US products comprise 65% of Canadian imports? Who needs customers?

2427 2018-09-05 19:03:53 The pipeline is for exporting oil not for Canadians to use it. The main reason to support the pipeline is for economic growth through sales. Using oil has nothing to do with it.

2628 2018-09-05 18:43:37 BC their agenda is being passed, conservative judges, EPA regulations gone, corporate tax cuts which affects them & big oil rules once again.  Doesn't matter that all of those will cause death of innocent Americans. Greed rules.
2629 2018-09-05 18:43:33 Repulsive I wish more than repulsed when I saw them hog hunting human beings into the oil wells in Kuwait and Iraq someone needs to stop the Arab Emirates Saddam Hussein is a member

2633 2018-09-05 18:43:17 I'm still trying to work out why socialists want to make coal miners  oil % gas workers unemployed.

Class war seems war seems to be more complicated these days.
2634 2018-09-05 18:43:17 What a perfekt Bike!
This XJR has run 222.925 km allready and Detlef want's to reach the 300.000. I'm sure he will reach it, because his bike is in a perfekt used condition. The engine has never been opened and does take just 125ml of oil/1000 km. Well done!!!
2635 2018-09-05 18:43:16 Get an oil change bitch ! You got off work early use your time efficiently 
2636 2018-09-05 18:43:15 DAT oil must touch u even before u run self
2637 2018-09-05 18:43:11 Mmmm the smell of the ocean  & oil refineries 
2638 2018-09-05 18:43:00 Lunch at #Arbys while getting an oil change... it's suddenly weird to be running errands without the kiddo in tow. #Stepmom #SchoolDaze #FreeTime
2639 2018-09-05 18:42:57 Some good customers came in last month, they ordered oil with hungry they know how to ingest. How authentic is that?
2640 2018-09-05 18:42:53 Probably because as a generation we don’t take care of our cars and there is always something needing maintenance when we go in for “just a quick oil change”
2641 2018-09-05 18:42:49 Crazy how I went from San Antonio to New Braunfels to Dilley and now I’m headed back to Cibolo. I just need to get my CDL and haul oil already.
2642 2018-09-05 18:42:44 Govt always pays for decommissioning costs for nuclear but I hadn't realised that after Thatcher had sold North Sea oil assets at bargain basement fire sale prices we'd be left with the clean up costs too.
Funny coincidence wasn't Dennis in oil too?
2643 2018-09-05 18:42:36 No I totally get it! Kinda like "Fry-Daddy" oil done vs oven.
2644 2018-09-05 18:42:33 Chale you no know ...boys hit the oil for the subsurface o... we blow finish.... 5 million barrels per day killer ..money don drop Chairman
2645 2018-09-05 18:42:23 Does it occur to these people we buy oil from Islamic countries? Like that oil is turned into the gas in our cars and the plastic straws in their McDonalds cafe coffee?
2646 2018-09-05 18:42:16 Brought my babe in for an oil change AND now I need a new battery
2647 2018-09-05 18:42:02 Ahh that might be what I’m after. I was worried the green would be too bright even after washing it down with nuln oil. Cheers I’ll give it a go

2650 2018-09-05 18:41:46 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Los Angeles sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
2651 2018-09-05 18:41:39 It is an actual circus there.
2652 2018-09-05 18:41:16 I love my car but I’m really tired of taking it in for an oil change and the mechanics finding other things that need fixed 
2653 2018-09-05 18:41:16 Oil natural gas, and coal are slow and expensive ways to create jobs. Renewables and efficiency are less capital intensive and therefore more efficient job creators.
2654 2018-09-05 18:41:10 Domestic oil and gas investments provide wonderful tax incentives

2662 2018-09-05 18:40:15 I think they just genuinely think that the pipeline is to give oil to Canadians... lmaooo
2663 2018-09-05 18:40:07 これはおっぱいじゃなくて油の貯蔵庫だよ。最悪の事態の時はここから、ね。
2664 2018-09-05 18:40:07 Frank, how can u say that? Anna is cold & heartless. Finn is warm. Like oil & water they do not mix, have zero chemistry 2gether.
2665 2018-09-05 18:40:01 That has been proven before I was born. 
Oil has never been BIAFRA's selling point, but the ability in her people. 

The Human Capital as we know is much more valuable than oil (can dry up), which won't last forever.

This is what scares the lot.
2666 2018-09-05 18:39:55 Alex Jones to Marco Rubio before their epic Greco-Roman wrestling match:

2667 2018-09-05 18:39:52 My 'Mai gulu' (moms elder sister) traveled decent kilometers to bring me anointing oil. "We live in a world filled with bad people, you need God's protection"

Mahn, these people are gonna get heart attacks when I tell them I'm now an atheist.
2668 2018-09-05 18:39:48 35,000 miles / 18mpg = 1,945 gallons x $3.20/gallon = $6224
Had she drove at the speed of light (670mil mph)  had free tires gas oil changes it would have taken her .0031min or .1881sec and it still would have been a tremendous waste of time and money
2669 2018-09-05 18:39:35 Oh they tried scamming me because it took 5 hours to do my oil change hahah they weren’t trying to charge me with anything else. But it backfired on me because they did mad damage under my hood

2674 2018-09-05 18:39:18 for really easy dinners if you don’t have time to cook, there’s a lot of ways to prepare cheap fish like tilapia with butter (or oil) and such, bake in parchment paper for a few minutes, and you can add a vegetable of the day like broccoli (also baked!)
2675 2018-09-05 18:39:13 The senators sucking up to their donors was nauseating! Trump is going to have to break up these monopolies!  They are no different than a monopoly like standard oil from the last century! Senators are complicit in this censorship !  The censorship of speech is the issue
2676 2018-09-05 18:39:10 ...okay, only Indian coconut oil is toxic!

2683 2018-09-05 18:38:22 Lol same, but it’s better than most foundations bc the clay absorbs some of the oil
2684 2018-09-05 18:38:20 I need all of that. All I could smell last night was olbas oil.
2685 2018-09-05 18:38:04 Do you have a copy of the original bill before it was broken down ?
2686 2018-09-05 18:38:00 That's good but first of all we need to complete the trans mountain pipeline and expand our oil markets outside North America.
2687 2018-09-05 18:38:00 There is an essential oil for every skin type from oily skin to dry skin find out what essential oil is best for your skin type in today's blog post.
2688 2018-09-05 18:37:59 Found an olive oil bottle in our kitchen. I’m gonna get it tested. Fingers crossed.
2689 2018-09-05 18:37:54 Solution for Europe is ground or air source heating. We used 5500 litres oil/ year. Today a 200 m deep borehole circulating coolant. Result no oil, no gas, £1electric provides £4 heat 24/7. Central heating and domestic water C65. Efficiency 400%. No yearly maintainence necessary.
2690 2018-09-05 18:37:45 Name one developing country that don't borrow, every country run on debts to grow and develop. Are you aware that USA the almighty developed country is owing China?

2693 2018-09-05 18:37:25 Things can get a little goofy when working on the car. Don't know if it's breathing years of accumulated dirt, oil, and rust, or trying to put on a bolt by feel for half an hour, but I ended up with "Lock Washer" stuck in my head, my rendition of "Rock Lobster"

2697 2018-09-05 18:37:06 Hi there! Since you're not consuming the hemp seed oil, the hemp oil should be fine if left out of the fridge for a few days. We don’t recommend consuming it once it has been left out of the fridge. Please let us know if you have any more questions. Safe travels! 
2698 2018-09-05 18:37:00 One of Trump’s best political points was he was against the Iraq war, I’d rather vote for someone opposed to war than one who fights phony wars for oil, Israel and opium.

2700 2018-09-05 18:36:44 Yes coconut oil only works for very specific skin types or conditions but people like to use it as a fix all for everything when it is probably making their other problems worse

2711 2018-09-05 18:35:21 Y-E-S, this! I haven't notice it help much with my hair, either. As far as oils go, I'm a much bigger fan of tea tree oil.
2712 2018-09-05 18:35:05 Yeah, that's what my mechanic does. It's either in need or an oil change or the gas cap, but right now, just getting fender and lights fixed. Then that. Then need to tackle suspension. One thing at a time.

2723 2018-09-05 18:34:04 Also coconut oil clogs your pores I’m so sick of people telling me to use that when it does not work with my skin type... like I swear people read one skin article and think they know all the tricks

2725 2018-09-05 18:33:55 I just think (in terms of environmental/human rights concerns), 's oil industry is *comparatively* better than most (if not all) oil producing nations.

One might not consider oil sands "good", but in an oil dependent economy - would be fair to say it's *preferable*, no?

2760 2018-09-05 18:30:24 Most natural hair products leave my hair dry, brittle and heavy. A benefit of using tresseme is it removes all of the dirt and oil build up in my hair leaving my follicles clean and open for fresh moisture
2761 2018-09-05 18:30:17 I would see how far away he was when he was on his way home in the oil field. Easier/safer than calling or texting him while he’s driving a big truck and half the time he didn’t know where the heck he was. It’s not a trust thing. Check on me, I’m at Target or Taco Bell

2763 2018-09-05 18:29:59 As Jones gets more desperate to hold on to his withering snake oil business I expect more of these attempts at relevancy. Enjoy the dustbin of history @RealAlexJones.
2764 2018-09-05 18:29:51 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.

2766 2018-09-05 18:29:32 If this Govt comes back. Economy will surely Jump provided they hv over come the mess  left by UPA. They hv done remarkable job specially Oil. Ministry under @dpradhanbjp
2767 2018-09-05 18:29:15 It’d be more conceivable that the US conditions the economic punishment if they weren’t to export that oil to them. How would this hurt Nicaragua’s relationship with Venezuela however?  would Ortega risk that? There are a lot of implications to that claim.

2775 2018-09-05 18:28:41 What are your thoughts on Palm oil?  Seems to be a bit higher in poly’s than coconut but similar in sat, mono, poly comp.  Highly processed like poison oils?
2776 2018-09-05 18:28:37 I've been advising my Italian housemate the benefits of the Rooster Potato. I offered him half a boiled one (recently boiled, still hot); he took out some Olive Oil, dribbled a little on the now plated potato and proceeded to eat. He says, 'It's a, very nice. Good flavour.'
2777 2018-09-05 18:28:14 This is what I am thinking as well. Everyone should be buying oil in the US now. What a widening. This was closer to 6 just a few weeks ago.

2780 2018-09-05 18:27:58 nah, I think he's as much a villain as jones is a snake oil salesman

2788 2018-09-05 18:27:31 That the US is sniffing in the Nic. situation because they want the oil. Nic. already has a good relationship with them (no matter the government)—
2789 2018-09-05 18:27:30 Why is fuel price going up yet we have oil in Turkana
2790 2018-09-05 18:27:28 By raising the cost of oil here.

2794 2018-09-05 18:27:01 Govt. Coffer swells with excise duty and poor burst to tears. Oh! PSU executive getting Profit sharing to the tune of 5 to 6 lacs.

2805 2018-09-05 18:26:10 @IndianOilcl .This is a complaint to Indian oil petrol pump station.

2807 2018-09-05 18:25:58 Nope. But fully half the plantations would dissappear tomorrow, if there were no OECD fuel mandates. Maybe more, as northern oil seeds would then be used for food instead of fuel.
2808 2018-09-05 18:25:58 I used coconut oil when I got a blister which broke and hot a blister on top of that blister.
2809 2018-09-05 18:25:55 This is violet leaf which is £14 for 5ml,it has the same properties but cheaper. I saw a bottle of pure violet at £3k once. Rose geranium has the same properties but is only a couple of pounds. Violet doesn’t release much oil. Do you use them in your therapies?

We should worry about becoming a polluted oil field mess like Texas and Oklahoma.(ground water matters)

2817 2018-09-05 18:24:43 Communism is indeed a joke, a particularly cruel one for those suffering under communist regimes. Communism is the state controlling the means of production, like Venezuela's oil

2822 2018-09-05 18:24:20 Hi Sam, actually Pennzoil Synthetics are unsurpassed in their ability to prevent sludge. Using low quality motor oil, neglecting to change your oil, and other maintenance issues can also lead to sludge forming in your engine. DM us if you have any questions!

2825 2018-09-05 18:24:11 We r going through the same pain. But just 4 the record, Nicaragua has no oil & no oil means no $ & this is how the prob started-govt tried to cut down social security. Nica students & farmworkers have led the struggle & sadly have the body count to prove it. Keep up the fight!

Can any one share views on oil stocks please
2863 2018-09-05 18:20:42 But we only make a fraction off our Oil & Gas...Still coming up short plus how much did we pay for that stake, more costs. Plus that's money which could have been used elsewhere like Health or Education. Its huge opportunity cost when you rob Peter to pay Paul.
2864 2018-09-05 18:20:35 I can't even drive my crush crazy i don't have enough oil 
2865 2018-09-05 18:20:18 Nope. Ingredients in this one are arrowroot, baking soda, coconut oil, Shea butter, candelillia, jojoba, magnesium hydroxide, activated charcoal & tocopherol.
Have tried 4 different ones and only the Spanish one works & doesn't cause problems
2866 2018-09-05 18:20:13 Taught to make pasta with an amazing marinara, and to eat pizza with a knife, fork and by hand, by a family friend from Sicily. In NYC, at home, pizza is eaten with a knife and fork, but outside, with witnesses, slightly folded to allow the oil to drip out.

2869 2018-09-05 18:19:40 Is the 'marketplace of ideas' akin to a bazaar? Everyone knows that besides hardworking vendors, there are also cheats, swindlers, snake oil salesmen, even the odd bookseller who peddles Mein Kampf. Every vendor is not to be equally respected. Every idea is not worth platforming.

2872 2018-09-05 18:19:07 You, most probably, have oily hair. That's why you can do it and should it. You should clean the excess oil. Unfortunately, not everyone has the same hair type or skin type and people need to take care of their own hair and skin type properly.

2878 2018-09-05 18:18:35 You vastly overstate the strength of the economy for the middle class. Tax cuts and stock market fueled by record corporate buybacks benefit the very few and real wages are flat. Rising oil prices, interest rates and unwinding QE doesn't help the middle class. Integrity matters.

2893 2018-09-05 18:16:49 But that solves one problem to create another. 100% of the oil revenue right now is used to pay the bills and NL still runs deficits. How do you replace any oil revenues you divert to rate mitigation?

2899 2018-09-05 18:16:08 Also unfair to criticize those who are already doing a lot to do even more. If you want to stop oil imports from countries like Saudi Arabia, please help by organizing or helping to fund protests. 2/2
2900 2018-09-05 18:16:07 @PepsiCo @Nestle @Pizza Hut & @TacoBell spend millions on their ‘ethical’ image & say they only use RSPO-certified #palmoil. But truth is @RSPOtweets gives the OK to destructive palm oil by brand @Indofood #savetheorangutans
2901 2018-09-05 18:16:06  good one,
2902 2018-09-05 18:16:06 Even if it's "Okay, here is how you: Check oil level, air pressure in tires and their tread", you've solved most *basic* OHSHIT issues.
2903 2018-09-05 18:15:59 So, the country can't spend much from the revenue it receives from the sale of crude oil. Hence, the loans.

2907 2018-09-05 18:15:15 French fries (potatoes fried in oil in France) & potato chips are actually potato crisps because when they are fried the potatoes go crispy, hence the name "crisps". English is called English because it's from England. Anyway who actually cares as long as your happy lol.

2909 2018-09-05 18:15:15 Ce n est pas la leterature write sytems of  politics of tomorrow hide faults and wrong decisions take it only for things else run from justice until now (fast earn oil...) and not the people and better life.
2910 2018-09-05 18:15:14 My father also works in the oilfield industry, and I’m not some imbecile that thinks that oil is the only energy sector, but having lived in Alberta and seeing their attitudes of entitlement I don’t feel one bit sorry for them. My parents live in Alberta P.S.
2911 2018-09-05 18:15:11 Well, for some countries, yes. But for others, no. Tho Nigeria has major stakes in the oil sector and there4 receives income from the sale of crude oil in addition to taxes, it needs to shore up its foreign reserves in order to defend the Naira (exchnge rate)
2912 2018-09-05 18:15:08 The only reason Britain stood with Nigeria during the 1967 Civil War, is oil.

Shell BP were cheque ready.

2914 2018-09-05 18:14:57 I'm not so sure it's about oil.The oil reserves have been known for decades. Oil isn't as important to the USA as it used to be. Fracking is making a big difference. Nowadays the USA also exports oil.
Yes the USA sees the current government of Nicaragua as confrontational at best
2915 2018-09-05 18:14:50 Argan oil covers a multitude of sins amiright ladies
2916 2018-09-05 18:14:46 So we swab it in the last while using the cleansing oil for 2nd time? Okeydokey
2917 2018-09-05 18:14:37 “...and have often followed the model of Big Tobacco and Big Oil—fighting regulation with lobbyists and funding their own studies that suggest their products are harmless.”

Guess these companies don’t realize their businesses will die along with the human race.

We are so fucked

2920 2018-09-05 18:14:15 Justin and his liberal govt have willfully destroyed the oil-sands - Canada has lost 90 billion in oil sales because of the Liberal govt - It is the intention of this Liberal Govt to never build a pipeline and to supplement lost income via carbon tax which will increase yearly.
2921 2018-09-05 18:14:11 Lots of people are working hard to help people reduce oil consumption by providing choices that are more efficient and use Clean energy. That is the real solution. Doing all this takes time and money. You can’t expect a few people to do everything. 1/2
2922 2018-09-05 18:14:06 Not to mention that all Oman’s pipeline is natural gas, not oil 
2923 2018-09-05 18:13:45 I thought the oil found in Kenya would ease the cost of living in Kenya but it has become an ironic!! Jubilee wamekuwa serikali ingine hatujawahi shuhudia!!! Cost of living is now becoming worse than before!!
2924 2018-09-05 18:13:42 I usually run a warm bath and put three drops of lavender oil and three drops of rosemary then bath and drink water then sleep, I do this everyday or second day. Try it and see if it helps otherwise see a specialist

2926 2018-09-05 18:13:17 Yes. The climate changes we know that. Hence vast oil reserves in the desert that was once lush primordial forest. Climate change induced by man? Doubtful.

2937 2018-09-05 18:11:31 The mid-August lows for gold bullion at US$1,184, for copper at US$2.56 and for crude oil at US$64 may have signaled the multi-year capitulation lows for most commodities. A test of these bottoms may be necessary but it looks to me that the lows have been set.

2942 2018-09-05 18:10:44 They have been talking about those mythical oil reserves since 1978 and nothing!!
2943 2018-09-05 18:10:41 They also wreck starters, and in heavy traffic, reduce oil flow to bearings that need it most.
2944 2018-09-05 18:10:40 There would have been no court ruling had Harper been in power. Why does Justin constantly scapegoat on the back of Harper?Liberals willfully killed the Oil Sands - 100% their agenda to KILL Canadian oil - this has been proven over and over again.  WON'T EVERY BE A LIB PIPELINE

2960 2018-09-05 18:09:12 The region of Aberdeen relies on the rest of Scotland to exist, the fact that it is populated by large numbers of immigrant workers who follow the oil has led to a disproportionate imbalance in the unionist numbers. They will benefit as we all will with independence
2961 2018-09-05 18:09:10 In 2014 UPA

Diesel price.              ₹. 48
Gas cylinder.             ₹400
Now 
Crude Oil Price is ₹ 70
If UPA was in control
Then Petrol will be ₹ 35
And Diesel will be. ₹ 26
And Gas cylinder.  ₹ 225

2968 2018-09-05 18:08:19 It's been a disaster but not because it was socialist. An over reliance oil revenue and external interference, particularly by the US, have played a large part.

2973 2018-09-05 18:08:11 Rightfully,  everyone has an agenda. We have the oil but no way to find it, extract it and commercialise it so we must get a good beating in the contract. But this usually brings political involvement, corruption and other strong suggestions on how to run the country.Hands tied.

2999 2018-09-05 18:05:31 Why not use the oil revenue to subsidize oil prices?
3000 2018-09-05 18:05:29 And almost none of that benefits Canada. The hardware is made in China and the technology comes from centers in the US and Europe. Canada has oil and gas, timber, minerals and lots of land for farming and ranching. If we don't do that, we can't pay your welfare benefits.
3001 2018-09-05 18:05:27 and further down the low pressure distillation tower is fuel and furnace oil, paraffin wax and then bitumen (the substance you say is for making roads and the cheapest of the entire production chain)

3003 2018-09-05 18:05:07 Sheldon Whitehouse is newest member of DB club.  Should Rhode Island even be allowed two senators when one is such a tool?  This doesn't speak highly of RI population to put this guy in office.

3010 2018-09-05 18:04:32 The USA has offered Prof. Dr Sharjeel Memon the chairmanship of U.S National Research Council after witnessing a successful experiment of converting Brandy into Honey and Vodka into Olive oil. He has also been shortlisted for Nobel Prize in Chemistry.
3011 2018-09-05 18:04:31 Well keep in mind WHAT you guys were using to smoke. Probably some type of tobacco wrap! I think for younger children with epilepsy, they should have some type of oil cannabis rather than smoking. And smoking should still be 18 so then they choose what to smoke out of!
3012 2018-09-05 18:04:28 I guess we wouldn't be sending Saudia Arabia weapons or dealing with their oil. Human rights? Especially, after our government indicted the Saudi government for planning and financing 9/11. Nine hi-jackers as well. 2799 dead.
3013 2018-09-05 18:04:21 If what you say is true, then sure, it's mental. Meanwhile, why is palm oil in almost every processed food in almost every supermarket?

3018 2018-09-05 18:03:52 Coconut oil is THE oil used for cooking in vast majority of #Malayali households, including mine. The truth is that we really don't know whether it is good or bad. 
But to call it 'pure poison' is clearly taking it a bit too far and bound to create panic among lay public.
3019 2018-09-05 18:03:49 There are lots of places in the ocean around the world believed to have oil in them. This happens to be in area claimed by Nicaragua. I guess I don't understand the question.

3028 2018-09-05 18:02:44 it's simple to reverse the rupee fall. Just reverse your fuel policy to UPAs, sell petrol for 45 ₹/ litre. Everything become OK.
Take my challenge
In UPA
Crude Oil price was ₹145
Petrol price.              ₹  63
Diesel price.              ₹. 48

3029 2018-09-05 18:02:39 @JoeVargas Just recently came across your Twitter.  I have 4 year old son who has epilepsy, his seizures have gotten bad.. He is on the max dose of his seizure medication.. Any suggestions on a CBD oil that would be Beneficial for him.? Any advice is greatly appreciated.
3030 2018-09-05 18:02:31 You seem to be discharging a slick fluid between your thighs. Do you require an oil change? I would be happy to assist.

3032 2018-09-05 18:02:00 Sur Rio Deseado Este was Patagonia Oil, then PMI Resources, then #PentaNova and now in hands of #Cruzsur The Sur Rio is a Heavy Oil belt w/ proven reserves, roughly $89 Million in value control by $8.5 Million startup company called Cruzsur Energy. Kick-off is soon. 10X potential

3035 2018-09-05 18:01:38 1. Crude oil is unlike vegetable oil that it goes stale. 
2. Petrol/ gasoline evaporates at 150°C in the distillation tower and there's nowhere on earth where the temperatures are that high incl. the Kalahari desert

3038 2018-09-05 18:01:16 I had heard that Trudeau was for transmountain because he thought it was going to be an inclusive amusement park ride. The thought of "laying pipe" and "oil" excited him... Then he found out what it was ...
3039 2018-09-05 18:01:12 Now, as I watch the sunrise.
Ah, the smell of oil, the morning light.

3040 2018-09-05 18:01:07 Crude oil is what they are. Yet to be refined.
3041 2018-09-05 18:01:00 If you cleanse, exfoliate, and or tone your skin. Absolutely! You want to always moisturize your skin after doing the things mentioned above because exfoliating leaves your skin parched so the grapeseed oil in our formula enhances the moisture and helps protects your skin.

Yep. After Obama sent all those cruise missiles to Lybia Russia got the oil contracts at discount.

Syria?  Increased arms sales and discounted rate on the warm sea port rent!  Good deal for Russia.

3061 2018-09-05 17:59:12 Funny how the oil became a blessing and a curse

3065 2018-09-05 17:58:55 #PentaNova could benefit from Agricultural issues in Argentina. The Incentive to find its own supply of Diesel for Agri is now very important. The finding of low sulphur oil at $10 in the ground cost, could enable the stability of Ag Exports only if capital is raised to drill.
3066 2018-09-05 17:58:50 Congrats on all of your delicious new #vegan products and also for your stance on Palm oil. Absolutely fantastic!! 
3067 2018-09-05 17:58:41 Salads are the biggest scam. Just made a big salad: romaine, spinach, avocado, carrots, lemon juice, craisins, hemp and chia seeds, with a sprinkle of olive oil and feta. 800 fucking calories and I’m not even full! Some bullshit
3068 2018-09-05 17:58:35 Try bio oil for the stretch marks if you haven’t already! They helped lightened mine after giving birth. Should’ve applied it during pregnancy 
3069 2018-09-05 17:58:34 i hate how i make a meal for myself and its ramen, and i eat it, and then i ate too much some how and here i am bloated and i dont ever want to eat again hate my stomach
3070 2018-09-05 17:58:31 I don’t understand what my skin wants from me. It’s been dry for years, and I found a routine that cleared me up and moisturized enough, and now I’m an oil slick and I don’t remember what to do with oily skin
3071 2018-09-05 17:58:20 I might be misunderstanding your question but...there are not literal barrels. It's a unit of measurement used to explain an amount of oil, whether tapped or untapped.
3072 2018-09-05 17:58:20 Two things, 1.the cost of life in Kenya for Wanjiku depends on Rain/drought cycles not oil prices. 2. Govt would raise more revenue by charging more levies on betting and data bundles..which Wanjiku cares little about.
3073 2018-09-05 17:58:18 Multi vitamins, Omega 6 (&Primrose oil for acne), Alpha Brain, Probiotics, Turmeric+Pepper supplement (for inflammation), spearmint (for hormonal acne), Ghee (separate from what's used in cooking)
3074 2018-09-05 17:58:05 Kind of hard to take modern "journalists" seriously.  They've completely abandoned all pretense of the "objective person who stands aside and records" role.
3075 2018-09-05 17:58:02 And then a bit of olive oil and put it on bread and yes.
3076 2018-09-05 17:57:57 Sandino is the main oil harbor. Again, where do you think these barrels are from?
3077 2018-09-05 17:57:43 I feel sorry for them they don't get to feast on food just oil.
3078 2018-09-05 17:57:26 I see now, misunderstood. I dont think thats true though about only caring about YTD. Im sure BP shareholders werent citing YTD after the oil spill. Not comparing Kaep to an oil spill. Just saying this has an impact on shareholders
3079 2018-09-05 17:57:23 The logic goes like if we don't have to use or buy oil/gas from the Middle East, then we don't have to bomb the Middle East in the first place.
44,000 bombs/year while NOT at war is not anything to be proud of.
Try logic.  It works.

3084 2018-09-05 17:56:27 I got a feeling the oil cartels are fighting back... liie they alws did for all other electric cars b4 tesla. Still, a technological advancement has the same shove like nature does, when makes its most inevitable move.
3085 2018-09-05 17:56:24 100% pure vitamin E oil works wonders. Also, don’t worry too much about it! It will fade
3086 2018-09-05 17:56:19 The mayo made with avocado oil is the best.  Thank me later.
3087 2018-09-05 17:56:15 Not really but your lack of understanding has finally shot your credibility. 'Oil rich' is a relative term, a commodity is only worth the profit it can be sold at and that  recoverable reserve is diminishing. Scotland needs diversification & change of government.

3091 2018-09-05 17:56:05 Your federal gov't used even weaker legal language when strongarming NEB Oil project decisions while quickening the pace, which may have got N.Gatew. further b4 being slammed hard by the courts.
Indignant self assuming priority, & cheerleading isn't an acknowledgement of impact.
3092 2018-09-05 17:55:57 Yes. Because of the biofuel mandates. If they don't, they face heavy fines; in the US and EU. Biofuels account for half of palm oil acreage.
3093 2018-09-05 17:55:53 And I’ll never forget the time we coconut oil and wrapped our hair and went to sleep like that 
3094 2018-09-05 17:55:43 Watercolour is probably the type of paint I've used the most, as it's so close to ink, and so easy to use together with ink. And while I have no mastery of it, I feel that I know enough about it to know more or less what I can do. With oil I'm starting at scratch.
3095 2018-09-05 17:55:39 Have you tried cbd oil, for starters? Xx
3096 2018-09-05 17:55:38 @LBC @Nigel_Farage 

We need to hit them hard without demeaning our selves. 

Russia is taking very seriously the oil in the Artic. No other country that has a claim to the region is making little effort. Let's take the Artic!
3097 2018-09-05 17:55:36 I wouldn’t describe Dundee and Glasgowshire as oil rich. (Scotnatland)
3098 2018-09-05 17:55:30 It was demolished a long time ago. There’s an oil tanker transshipment facility based there now. I’m actually from Point Tupper originally.

3107 2018-09-05 17:53:52 It shows your level of exposure.. Many successful countries does it and it works for them.. Oil can't the the nation's source of income for ever
3108 2018-09-05 17:53:37 Oil, yes, perhaps, but there is another reason they are being bombed. Can you guess?
3109 2018-09-05 17:53:36 The Russian economy is based on oil price. To hit them where it hurts, work with American to make more shale gas and flood the market with it and bring the oil price down to £32 a barrel @lbc #nigelfarage
3110 2018-09-05 17:53:30 We do refine Elizabeth.  Why does BC use the existing pipeline to export oil to refine and buy it back if they can buy refined oil from Alberta?

3134 2018-09-05 17:50:47 Marijuana is an active component in a lot of drugs and cosmetics.
It is the new oil, and pharmaceutical companies are rushing the product.

The state of California alone has made 3 billion$

3141 2018-09-05 17:49:41 Nice idea but that was similar to what we had in the 19th and early 20th centuries. It lead to all our environmental problems of the time and corporations using thugs to break unions and snake oil for medicine. The Fed is unfortunately necessary to stem rampant greed.

3154 2018-09-05 17:48:27 Thanks to @AlaskaAir I had to practically disrobe for TSA inspection, and now I’m stuck between two massive north slope oil workers. Sad!
3155 2018-09-05 17:48:22 Honestly I’d suggest (in my hippie way) evening primrose, starflower oil and or kalms tablets. Frustration is like a can of fizzy soda, keep shaking it adding to it, the pressure has to go somewhere. Also loud raucous music helps me ;)

3157 2018-09-05 17:48:15 Eastern roads are bad, who will build them? The sea requires dredging, who is suppose to dredge them. Militant attacks can be a reason for the ports not working but will not stop oil exploration in the region. Your statements does not hold water.
3158 2018-09-05 17:48:04 If researchers get Billions in federal funding (not Millions like “big oil” pays) , how can we trust them? They are gorging on the trough known as the federal government and have every incentive to make sure their findings will be the type that guarantees more fed funding
3159 2018-09-05 17:47:59 I melt the resin off of seed crops but I'm an odd cod.  Most producers aim for seedless smoking flowers, consumers hate burning even one immature bean.  Seed weight cuts into resin weight for extraction operations.
Any cannabis crop can be used for seed oil, meds, and hempcrete.

3198 2018-09-05 17:44:15 I agree that we should be supplying Western crude to Eastern Canada. My point is the  protesters are against  building pipelines here which would prosper our country but I don't see them protesting dirty tanker oil coming  from foreign countries. Guess they think that that's ok.

3225 2018-09-05 17:40:59 It doesn't surprise me. This just proves that there is a pattern with the oil companies and the provincial/municipal governments. They are in collusion with one and other.

3284 2018-09-05 17:34:13 Reality is in an economy like ours where hoarding of products(sugar&unga) is always  used to skyrocket demand hence prices but no one seems to see the hoarding...Oil is a billions business controlled by few who seem to be flexing their muscles with GoK anyway kenya ina wenyewe ..
3285 2018-09-05 17:34:12 @DonaldJTrumpJr TO PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP I JUST CHECKED WITH THE VETERANS HOSPITAL IN HOUSTON THEY SAID THEY COULD NOT ISSUE PURE HEMP OIL
WOULD YOU TAKE CARE OF THAT MATTER PLEASE.THANKS WOULD YOU PLEASE SHOW THIS TO THE .PRESIDENT THANKS
3286 2018-09-05 17:34:06 Bio oil, para mi, el mejor
3287 2018-09-05 17:33:59 Even XLE can climb all the way back with oil still down 150bps. Stocks just find a way to climb again.
3288 2018-09-05 17:33:57 Good Afternoon partriots.
A bitch-fight with Marco and Alex, I never thought I would see that, amusing to say the least.  Alex Jones, is nothing more than a snake oil saleman.  Marco a punk.  I say put them in a ring together.
3289 2018-09-05 17:33:55 oil cleansing after clay mask? ah i thought it's the other way around (oil cleansing before clay mask) can try lah after this :)
3290 2018-09-05 17:33:51 I know this feeling lol
Add oil Nakajin and team
3291 2018-09-05 17:33:48 Oil is often found in unpleasant places so they just have to model anyhowness and be ready for it.
3292 2018-09-05 17:33:42 Needs to sell more snake oil.
3293 2018-09-05 17:33:39 @Kmarkobarstool I’m in oil and gas, but also do a few other things. We’ve got a distillery opening up. Any interest in creating a KMarko branded bourbon? You can pick the mash on it
3294 2018-09-05 17:33:32 Not screw in. Just like when you check the oil
3295 2018-09-05 17:33:18 In particular, run a rail line to Burnaby for rail transport of oil to K-M's existing oil terminal.
3296 2018-09-05 17:33:14 My car battery died in the middle of an oil change

3299 2018-09-05 17:32:45 It’s so sad that #Islam, once the leader in religious toleration, mathematics, science, and Art, fell to Kowtowing to the British & Americans to get access to oil wealth, producing this vile #Wahhabist brew that oppresses women and speech with obscene zeal.
3300 2018-09-05 17:32:40 Of course, and when BP spilled oil all over the gulf, employees privy to their negligence should have blown the whistle to the executives *eyerolls*
3301 2018-09-05 17:32:38 Electric cars are fun to drive, are less expensive and more convenient to fuel than gasoline vehicles, are better for the environment, promote local jobs, and reduce our dependence on foreign oil.
3302 2018-09-05 17:32:30 No problems. Eu comecei a ouvir o Midnight Oil assiduamente em 2011 com a música In The Valley, do álbum Earth and Sun and Moon, de 1993 que teve como hit a música Truganini que era uma dura crítica a monarquia britânica e foi usada durante o referendo de 1999 sobre a república
3303 2018-09-05 17:32:21 @ChrisFixed how do I diagnose where an oil leak is coming from?
3304 2018-09-05 17:32:20 Do not cook oils (palm oil, vegetable oil etc) on high heat. Low-heat cooking or baking (less than 240 degrees) prevents oils or fats from turning carcinogenic.
3305 2018-09-05 17:32:14 Coal and oil... what would they do?
3306 2018-09-05 17:32:08 “to grant those who mourn in Zion - to give them a beautiful headdress instead of ashes, the oil of gladness instead of mourning, the garment of praise instead of a faint spirit; that they may be called oaks of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he may be glorified.”
3307 2018-09-05 17:32:06 @FLOTUS TO PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP I JUST CHECKED WITH THE VETERANS HOSPITAL IN HOUSTON THEY SAID THEY COULD NOT ISSUE PURE HEMP OIL

3308 2018-09-05 17:32:03 please keep your cows away as these trees are too young. Otherwise I have a full recipe written for the Chappal Kebabs so we need more beef here.

3309 2018-09-05 17:31:52 The Bearish Case For Oil
 
A relatively new development in global oil markets has unfolded in recent months, one that has replaced another new development that also has the ability to also roil oil markets...

3314 2018-09-05 17:30:42 And these guys imagine as if "science" is "static". We have seen "coconut oil"-wisdom recently anyway. Even re' "global warming" the "scientists" were warning of "ice age" in 60s or some time around that.

What more can one expect from Judeo-brAhmins?

Have you ever tried to see the transmission sight glass, GOOD LUCK. On top of that, the oil is clear. Even with a bright light and glasses, no way.
3318 2018-09-05 17:30:08 Argan oil is good for moisturizing your lips.
3319 2018-09-05 17:30:08 We also have a new CBD massage oil coming out, made specifically for our company 
3320 2018-09-05 17:30:08 Buy a Subaru and you have a 1970 Vega's reliability. It is an oil burner and disaster at 53000 miles. Subaru will not help but they did loose a class action  for their oil burners. Buy a ford or chevy. My 2003 5.4 Ford burns ZERO oil at 127000 miles
3321 2018-09-05 17:30:04 Uninformed statements, same as what they used to say in 79. Oil money is minuscule , it’s not a lucrative GPD for a large country. Mcdonald corp, Amazon, Apple, have gross revenues 100 folds the gross revenue of Iran’s oil. Iran needs mangement & proper international relations.
3322 2018-09-05 17:30:00 Thanks to shale development in the Permian and Eagle Ford, the Lone Star State is one of the top producers of oil and gas in the world! #WednesdayWisdom #WednesdayWisdom

3329 2018-09-05 17:29:23 Oil is the foreign policy of some nations. Oil men have access to western intel agencies who help them force regime change if your president’s head is not correct. But they dread populism. SA govt can’t make them decline Abba Kyari’s card at Phillipe Patek, so?

3336 2018-09-05 17:28:44 yes but seems like a much bigger short-term problem for conventional automakers than oil and gas, right?
3337 2018-09-05 17:28:41 Also aboard the Chinese ships in July 1975 were 200 tons of machine oil, 2,600 tons of ploughshares, 237,000 shovels, 148,000 hoes, 9,000 railway sleepers, 1,000 cases of railway equipment, 3 diesel engines, 2,200 tons of cloth, 200 tons of cotton, and 1,400 tons of jute. #PolPot

3339 2018-09-05 17:28:28 The only product they export is oil and the production us state owned, so socialist. Free market capitalism allows all to create and enjoy the results of wealth. Socialism means being forced to eat all the animals in the zoo

3348 2018-09-05 17:27:18 I love it when my professors throw shade to other scholars. Deadass, he said, “I do not agree with any of his objections to this argument and next class I’ll throw him in boiling oil.”
3349 2018-09-05 17:27:12 So if I introduce myself to you it is okay to talk to you however I please? Fuck outta here #catlady #makessense
3350 2018-09-05 17:26:55 War costs trillions. Corporate money earmarked to lobbying government is significantly less than the cost of oil wars, renewable wars, etc. They get that money back in subsidies anyway. Without government, they'd have to bear that entire cost themselves. It's cost prohibitive.
3351 2018-09-05 17:26:53 @MLPguy  Something's gone wrong ....

Oil price declines,  MLP share prices decline.
Oil price increases,  MLP share prices decline.

3359 2018-09-05 17:25:55 Avoid at all costs ... CBD oil is the way to go.
3360 2018-09-05 17:25:49 About time. Have they taken the palm oil out of their cookies yet?
3361 2018-09-05 17:25:46 Little offers similar review of Amnd. 11, to ban offshore oil drilling & vaping in public. "I can't have it both ways. I've got to take the package, and there's no compelling state interest. ... I'd like to address the others, but I know the Supreme Court is addressing those."
3362 2018-09-05 17:25:37 Nigeria is enriched in Coco, Rubber & Oil yet we keep taking Loans..... Where does all the Revenue from our Crude Oil Goes To........
3363 2018-09-05 17:25:36 @LindaFoods shopping in @sainsburys and astonished to find palm oil listed in you ingredients for sausages. #rainforestdestroyed
3364 2018-09-05 17:25:34 Isn't this more "one in the bag vs 2 in the bush"?  Oul has a definite value, even more useful than gold, but underground oil 8n an unstable country, not so much.
3365 2018-09-05 17:25:16 Yeah but socialism didn’t do that.... they borrowed billions of dollars against their sole export - oil - and then OPEC drove down the price so much that they can not afford their debt. Then they printed money causing hyper inflation. Almost nothing to do with socialism.

3368 2018-09-05 17:25:09 Almost every dollar earned from our our oil production goes to payroll of salaries and wages. HM @FinMinNigeria had acknowledged the weight of the Federal monthly wage bill.
3369 2018-09-05 17:25:07 It's the same thing. Tell us what PDP did to revive railway transport in 16 years..or wht GEJ did in 5 years with high oil revenue. We all know what Buhari is doing today.

3371 2018-09-05 17:24:46 China's aid to Cambodia during 1975 included 61,000 tons of rice, 30,000 tons of fuel, 3,000 tons of kerosene, 200 tons of machine oil, 250 tons of pesticides, 3,300 tons of cloth, 60 tons of medicines, 1.8 million hoes, 200,000 shovels, 5000 pesticide sprays and 20,000 bicycles.

3373 2018-09-05 17:24:28 Iran problem is not America or Trump  you people are the problem, what is happen to over $ 2 trillium of ravenous in past 40 years? Iran had only 120 billion $ from day of discovery of oil up to 1979 and did a lot and people had reasonable life and $ was worth 70 Rials.
3374 2018-09-05 17:24:17 How much was the loan and credit taken from Iran for oil by upa,  any idea,  who will repay those loans , who created npas,

3378 2018-09-05 17:23:46 If Gold Falls. Credit gets more expensive. Trade slows down because credit is hard to obtain at lower costs. Oil is priced in Dollars, but Dollars are priced in Debt and Rate of Exchange Risk. This is all about to change. Everywhere.

3385 2018-09-05 17:22:33 A view of California's fossil fuel past. Oil rigs on the Southern California coast in the 1940s. And our energy future.
3386 2018-09-05 17:22:32 I really wish I could take a nap before I go get my oil changed :(
3387 2018-09-05 17:22:30 There's a lot of snake oil in the legal weed industry. Possibly more snake oil than CBD oil, amirite? Snake oil has for eons thrived anywhere there's cash.
3388 2018-09-05 17:22:28 So I’ve got home from work in such a bad mood and mum has given me a cannabis oil lollipop so I can “chill out without breaking the law”, wow this woman
3389 2018-09-05 17:22:27 Holy shit. Getting my oil changed and listening to @MyFavMurder in my headphones when the volume cuts out. What happened? The Bluetooth in my car kicked on and the podcast started playing FROM THE CAR while all the guys were out there. Any chance they’re Murderinos? #byeee

3395 2018-09-05 17:21:31 Wiro Sableng, the Frozen Chicken Nugget you fried too quickly in boiling oil that was too hot.

It's crispy and appetizing on the outside, but still frozen on the inside. 

Unpleasant to consume, but what pisses you off the most is the unfulfilled potential it has.

Miniseries it
3396 2018-09-05 17:21:30 Do you own a car? Don't be a hypocrite! Petroleum products are used every single day in products you can't begin to imagine, oil is going no where anytime soon! #wakeup

3400 2018-09-05 17:21:21 @MelissaLeeCNBC what would a break up of say Facebook look like? Remember when Standard Oil was broken up Rockefeller was still majority share holder in all companies. He just got richer. I could be wrong

3402 2018-09-05 17:20:59 I don't mean this in a bad derogatory way, but once all the oil dries up the US won't  have anything to do with Middle East, aside from israel, and our policy will change. To coin a phrase " it isn't in strategic interest in USA to stay in region "
3403 2018-09-05 17:20:55 The democrats are raping infowars -alex Jones.

3415 2018-09-05 17:19:48 The law is unconstitutional and needs to be challenged. Tribal and Sacred land How can the LAND/OIL POISONERS be allowed to do this and get away with it.
3416 2018-09-05 17:19:42 Here’s the paradox. Europe is heavily dependent on Russia for gas, but is rich in shale for fracking. The U.K. found N.Sea gas & oil and the then EEC wouldn’t let us join until after that was found & have systematically asset stripped us of it ever since.
3417 2018-09-05 17:19:38 They use some type of veg oil mixed with thymol crystals.  The oil gets in the honey and dose not work at treating mites.  Formic acid MAQ's work better.
3418 2018-09-05 17:19:30 They need a pass to get into chambers? 
So what is the connection?

3420 2018-09-05 17:19:22 How many Barrel of Crude Oil do we produce in a year, Who & what country do we sell to, How Much Do We Sell Per Barrel, Where Does The Revenue Goes To........
3421 2018-09-05 17:19:16 Oil multi-billionaire buys Gillingham, spends a £billion to win EPL and UCL, does that make them a big club? Successful yes...but not big.

3424 2018-09-05 17:18:55 Modi Govt. had inherited Rs 1.4 lakh crore unpaid bills of the oil companies during 2009-14. It paid back with interest of 70000 Cr. This is the way congress hurt the country from past 60 years with no dedication for country development.
3425 2018-09-05 17:18:49 I used to spray the outside of the spuds with that light cooking oil shite then crack a load of black pepper and rock salt before they go in the oven, very nice!
3426 2018-09-05 17:18:48 I don’t trust doctors. If I feel unwell, I just go for dry brushing, and put some chai essential oil in my diffuser.

3430 2018-09-05 17:18:02 @traderpetem do you have any thoughts on the shanghai crude oil exchange. some are saying its killing WTI and Brent.  I suspect differently and am wondering what your experience thinks of it? Thanks.
3431 2018-09-05 17:17:49 Pakistan has never had a Nobel Peace Prize in Chemistry. 

I NOMINATE #SharjeelMemon FOR THIS SLOT FOR 2018. 

For converting Whisky into Honey and Vodka into Olive Oil.
3432 2018-09-05 17:17:46 I just want to clarify... So you feel it's better to support Countries and buy oil from places that have huge human rights abuses rather than supporting your own country? #supportlocal #supportthecountryyoulivein
3433 2018-09-05 17:17:40 When UK politicians have said something along the lines of 'if we pull our belts in there, will be benefits in the future' I've been waiting for that to happen following the Oil Crisis of the 1970's.
3434 2018-09-05 17:17:39 Dear Twitter, 

No my wife hasn’t left me. In fact we just celebrated our 7th anniversary. 

I’m not interested in snake oil pills for desperate, middle aged, divorced men. 

Your algorithm is really fucking broken.
3435 2018-09-05 17:17:39 From my very limited understanding one thing one shouldn't do is drive too fast right after starting the engine. And this has more to do with lubrication. Before the engine reaches "optimum" temp the oil won't be as viscous which in the long run won't be good for the engine
3436 2018-09-05 17:17:30 And around what Nigeria presently generates in few months from oil revenue. It's not the end of world my friend! Stop trying to make it look like one. Nigeria has been borrowing long before China came into the picture. Atleast Chinese loans are tangible, you see them on ground...
3437 2018-09-05 17:17:07 Wow & he was actually wrong about the reason the other nations united to defeat Germany, it was because of the coal in Poland.  Thus the European coal & steel community formed after WWI & WWII to try & stop these wars over resources.  But then... oil.
3438 2018-09-05 17:16:58 Bros I just want the oil to be sucked off
3439 2018-09-05 17:16:57 इस वीडियो में ना तो इसने किसी सरकार की तारीफ़ की है ना ही बुराई । बल्कि इसने ये बताया है कि मोदी और केजरी चाहे तो दिल्ली में पेट्रोल और डीज़ल सस्ता हो सकता है । मोदी अगर बेकार है तो केजरी oil सस्ता करके अच्छा होने का सबूत क्यूँ नहीं देता ? या वो भी उतना ही बेकार है ?

We need their oil, they need our weapons.

We are... they.
3448 2018-09-05 17:15:59 Well they pay their debt to China in oil as I understand it, millions of barrels.
3449 2018-09-05 17:15:58 "Why does this Larabar smell like a candy cane?" I wondered as I realized everything in my purse was covered in peppermint essential oil.

3456 2018-09-05 17:15:19 It would be nice not to have a bipolar diseased govt running our affairs. We would not be here at all. Let the oil companies be for contending with the ERC shenanigans for so long.

3458 2018-09-05 17:15:13 Almond butter is so tasty, but can be messy when you open it. The trick? Store it upside down. All of the oil will go to the top so when you flip it back over the oil will be at the bottom and it won't splash everywhere when stirring it.

3465 2018-09-05 17:14:26 I swear this was lip oil
3466 2018-09-05 17:14:25 Because oil and coal companies buy our politicians. People will do anything for money and power.
3467 2018-09-05 17:14:22 because he provides an amazing product that people want.. we all benefit. john d Rockefeller became the richest man in history not by raising the price of oil lol but by lowering it from 1 dollar a barrel to 5 cents, everyone could afford to buy it then.
3468 2018-09-05 17:14:20 The US also trained Saudi terrorists how to fly the commercial planes they flew into the Twin Towers. @SaudiEmbassyUSA has never been held accountable for 9/11 despite the majority of terrorists being Saudi citizens. It’s all about oil.

3477 2018-09-05 17:13:30 Hey we do not have oil in our country, Venezuela has but Nicaragua don't, where did you get that information? Be careful about the kind of info you talk because can confuse others people with wrong data.
3478 2018-09-05 17:13:24 Hundreds of thousands daily fleeing Venezuela to Colombia in search of food! And the World just standing idly by! And one of biggest oil reserves on the plant!!
3479 2018-09-05 17:13:24 I need to read my fish oil more carefully. I bought weird stuff from Target that said "Wild Alaskan Fish Oil" and it tastes like some herb concoction added to it because people can't handle their fish. I used to buy wild SALMON oil & bite into them just to feel something.
3480 2018-09-05 17:13:09 101? Spoiled by oil 
3481 2018-09-05 17:13:09 You need me to rub oil over you
3482 2018-09-05 17:13:08 The problem is not about what countries are helping them, but what countries are messing with them to destabilize politically and economically, did you know Venezuela is the country with more oil in LatAm? You know who loves oil?
3483 2018-09-05 17:12:59 #ArunJaitley ji or Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh ji or the oil companies are not going to win elections for BJP but surely they are playing spoilsport for the party, making PM @narendramodi ji's & party president @AmitShah ji's task more difficult with each passing day.

3489 2018-09-05 17:12:30 Palm oil body @RSPOtweets has delayed deciding whether to kick #palmoil villain Indofood out for two years now. I want them to take action sooner!
3490 2018-09-05 17:12:22 This. If academics don't take ownership of disseminating their research to the general public, it will be claimed by the latest snake oil salesperson and Goopified, and you'll have the next vaccines=autism online disease.

3492 2018-09-05 17:12:02 What a complete clown you are. 1. If Scotland is such a disaster, WHY is Westminster desperate to hang on to it. 2. Oil will be Scotland's, but also Scotland will entitled to have of all UK assets. BoE eg. 3. Those 2 questions should tell you we subsidise you.
3493 2018-09-05 17:12:01 Big mistake from Modi govt: yielding to US pressure to cut down oil imports from Iran. The recent fuel price rise could have  been avoided with a greater supply of oil from Iran. Iran trade was particularly beneficial as it was happening in INR rather than $ 
#iran #Modi #oil
3494 2018-09-05 17:11:58 Largest debt per capita in the world.
Oil and gas is used everyday and you use it as much as anyone. 
Let the technology develop on its own if it is any good then subsidize it. It is not economically feasible to subsidize projects that may or may not work out.
Pay the debt.
3495 2018-09-05 17:11:58 I don't miss eating taco bell for lunch four days a week for 3 years

Sometimes I crossed the road to go to Wendy's for a change of pace, but then they started using the oil I'm allergic to @.@
3496 2018-09-05 17:11:56 We haven't cut off imports completely. We have alerted the oil companies to be ready for any eventuality. Geopolitics will dictate how things go.
3497 2018-09-05 17:11:55 the optimist in me would like to think we'll come out of this a little more wary and wise. the realist in me is preparing for the rise of the next silicon valley snake oil salesman.
3498 2018-09-05 17:11:54 How US intelligence assisted the British Oil interests in overthrowing Mohamed Mossadegh in the 1953 coup lead by Kermit Roosevelt the similarities of what's taking place with Trump are stunning
3499 2018-09-05 17:11:48 Check the oil price in 2014, next time.  Maybe that made a bit of a difference? Once again the Fraser Institute mines statistics and spins them like Trump.
3500 2018-09-05 17:11:40 Had oats for dinner.. yummy! Recipe  courtesy @saffrontrail . Thanks, it was very tasty. No toppings reqd. Just added tomato and carrot. I guess coconut oil added a new dimension to the dish.
3501 2018-09-05 17:11:37 Why pay attention to this snake oil salesman? In my life people lie this gentleman are left on the fringes of acceptable society as a lunatic.
 The man espouses vitriol. Lies. Then in a divorce suit told the public it was all lies, but individuals seek his brand of madness. Sad.
3502 2018-09-05 17:11:30 LAPSSET is a white elephant if the other infrastructure isn't developed with the oil pipeline as the flagship project. Too ambitious of a project through the middle of nowhere.

Demographics determine demand and supply. It's more like the  Chinese silk road <•••• white smoke
3503 2018-09-05 17:11:30 No need to pick your own mushrooms. BC's "oil" hits the open market in six weeks. With all that revenue flowing in they can hire people to pick the mushrooms.

3507 2018-09-05 17:10:10 Sir its fake news. Oil prices are even not discussed as per naeem ul haq.

3510 2018-09-05 17:10:03 The Nigerian government can’t treat Mobil, Shell or Chevron or any of the big oil companies the way they’ve treated MTN. One thing I learnt from The Quest is that oil men know how to handle countries like Nigeria very very well. It’s part of their job
3511 2018-09-05 17:09:59 I love oil, exactly because I fail so miserably with it. With acrylics I can still «draw with colour», and get pretty good results. Oil, however, forces me to truly paint, and that does not come naturally to me. So that's where the fun is.
3512 2018-09-05 17:09:58 £1.30 a litre or £5.85 a gallon?
Why is it so expensive when Oil is $20 a barrel cheaper than back in 2014, the last time it hit this price?
£1.30 will buy $1.67 at todays rates, yet Petrol in US is only $4 a gallon or £3.10?
3513 2018-09-05 17:09:56 Purchased oil paints on a whim and now I'm down a color mixing rabbit hole trying to find the right oxblood. I haven't painted in 15 years. Relearning.
3514 2018-09-05 17:09:55 You already do. Your money is going to Banks being bailed out, Oil Company Subsidies, Taxes not being paid by Amazon, etc.

Question is where would you rather that money go? Huge corporations that don't need it or people, which includes you.
3515 2018-09-05 17:09:52 Yikes, this happens with Omega 369 and Fish Oil. Only solution I've found is to eat before and take them with a whole glass of water to make sure they're not still in the esophagus

3523 2018-09-05 17:08:55 Went to the grocery after a tough WOD to pick up some dinner and repair my torn hands. Bought a kielbasa, vitamin E oil, latex gloves, and wine. Apparently  when the cashier asks “Did you find everything? answering “You’re out of duct tape.” is not a proper response...

3531 2018-09-05 17:08:17 We export oil?
3532 2018-09-05 17:08:11 False. There is not profitable amounts of oil in our coasts.
3533 2018-09-05 17:08:09 Yes we do have so much progressive sind govt. that after continuing 11th year of governance the performance is landmark as we saw that whisky and vodka converted into honey and olive oil just within half an hour

3537 2018-09-05 17:07:46 Both.
When you spend every reserve you have (on giveaway populism), reduce every bit of capital incentive to nil (from oil rights, property,pvt businesses) & turn 96% of export production (90% GDP) to “state efficiency” the oil price dip causes 96% collapse.

3539 2018-09-05 17:07:16 That's just plain fucking stupid. Save them by finding a renewable resource that doesnt involve oil so you arent having spills and poisoning their ecosystem. Save them by properly disposing of plastic items and cutting plastic rings.
3540 2018-09-05 17:07:15 With My best knowledge the oil transporters at the industrial area depot & konza depot...have gone on a go slow to demonstrate against  the immoral/inhuman 16% VAT..tax..

3545 2018-09-05 17:06:42 Maybe tell patients to use less harmful drugs that can do the same exact thing, like I dont know cannabis, for the ones saying what if they have lung problems you can eat edibles or vape cbd oil. CBD oil wont get you high either but big pharma would lose money so thats a no go

No control over our defence 
No control over tax laws
I could go on....
3549 2018-09-05 17:06:25 I'd imagine you're gonna get an oil change and have your tire looked at. Probably pay off some of the loan, give a necklace back to your dad and then sniff my farts

3557 2018-09-05 17:05:31 I remember when Levi’s were dirt cheap because no one but farmers wore them. Guess they want to go back to those days. Sweat suits, leggings, and PJs are already quickly replacing jeans. Just like oil & water, business & politics don’t mix.

3682 2018-09-05 16:50:35 Headline: "Coconut Oil May Be Contributing to Your Acne"

Who knew that rubbing oil on your face clogged pores? Oh, everyone, for a long time? Okay then.
3683 2018-09-05 16:50:32 Well said! Investing in big oil and coal is investing in the past. Meanwhile, the first nation  to crack the technology behind clean energy sustainability will have every other nation on a string as a customer. Neglecting the energy race is economic folly!
3684 2018-09-05 16:50:30 One day we will realize we can’t drink oil nor can we eat money.
3685 2018-09-05 16:50:26 I love when companies blame a price increase on fuel costs.  Where was the price decrease for customers when oil prices were declining in 2015 and 2016?  @ridetheferry
3686 2018-09-05 16:50:25 Of course I’m a partisan, just like Guttenberg who announced a week ago that he was going to the hearing specifically to stop Kavanagh from being confirmed. It was a staged ambush designed to harm Kavanagh, not a benign greeting and it backfired.

3688 2018-09-05 16:50:13 @arunjaitley 
I agree that prices of crude aren't stable, they goes up/down. When they goes up, prices of oil also increases but when crude was at record low last year, why prices of oil was not decreased significantly.
We know well which corporate house got benefitted

3691 2018-09-05 16:49:47 All of that being true bt the fuel produced by Sasol and exported to Zambia iz not exactly the same as the 1 that is sold in SA.
 Sasol produces fuel from coal & fuel sold in SA iz produced from crude oil. “ I think am right”.  I stand to be corrected tho,
3692 2018-09-05 16:49:42 These fine ass fees w/ these short cuts ...... make me wanna give you a Hot oil treatment!
3693 2018-09-05 16:49:37 Kenyan Government raising oil. Prices to raise money to repay debts, how are you to settle debts when you killing the economy.
@UKenyatta you need to. Review your government strategies to generate income.
Otherwise to all Kenyans as usual Goodluck with life.

And why would Germany buy gas & oil from them? Because capitalism. 
No one said ‘afraid’ of Russia, nor that people shouldn’t do business with them. 
Doesn’t mean Russia is our or EU’s ‘friend’
3697 2018-09-05 16:49:11 Had the West, esp the UK, not exploited that country for its oil, while its citizens lived in poverty to prop up the immense profits of a few, or endorsed their corrupt, authoritarian leader at the time, the revolution may not have happened. Stop rewriting history ffs

3699 2018-09-05 16:49:07 One of my guesses is that it seriously threatens the bottom lines of the oil giants and generator suppliers/manufacturers. But that's because I can't think of anything else. Hence baffled. I had high hopes when Fashola became Minister but alas.

3718 2018-09-05 16:46:42 And what about all the land in South America where you gather oil sands that you could use to have solar farms but you don’t? Why not just convert into an electric car charge station instead of continuing to use gasoline? Just wondering/:

3724 2018-09-05 16:45:51 Johnny, those same people had strategic oil reserves & developed Sasol specifically to reduce our vulnerability to oil price changes.

Any idea yet who exactly authorised the sale of SA's reserves? At what prices? And where did the money go???

3823 2018-09-05 16:35:51 Old people are some of the most judgemental nasty people about, sat on the bus home from work and almost every person we’ve drove past they have made a comment on something about them, sorry Margret you’re not an oil painting yourself love
3824 2018-09-05 16:35:51 They have a very small footprint there. Admit it, their Caliphate is gone, and it is because Trump allowed us to do what we needed to do in order to crush them underfoot. We buried them with a MOAB in Afghanistan. They no longer make $30M a month in oil revenue, they are now JV.
3825 2018-09-05 16:35:43 "Winter is an etching, 
spring a watercolor, 
summer an oil painting and autumn a mosaic of them all."

3826 2018-09-05 16:35:41 I also use a little bit of oil in a filament filter thing.  It helps tremendously.
3827 2018-09-05 16:35:40 It’s not. US invaded, killed it’s President, stole their oil and left only chaos - and a terror Organisation called ISIS. 

Hoch lebe Russland, ihr Hater!!!
3828 2018-09-05 16:35:37 Companies saying one thing & doing the other sound familiar? Palm oil industry regulator @RSPOtweets claims to boost ‘ethical’ #palmoil > truth is it certifies exploitation palm oil company @Indofood, @Nestle & @PepsiCo’s business partner
3829 2018-09-05 16:35:34 So I might get a credit car specifically for car maintenance. Things like tire rotations, oil, new tires, stuff to actually keep my car alive.
3830 2018-09-05 16:35:33 If those politicians and other Canadians who believe Canada’s oil is somehow the “dirty oil” (those (like @ElizabethMay) hoodwinked by Greenpeace et al) take their foot off our energy industry’s neck, billions of  $ more will be available for new schools and other social benefits
3831 2018-09-05 16:35:33 As a kid I remember sitting at Tenean Beach and seeing the old cage oil tank that used to sit there before Boston Gas put up that tank. It was a few years before it got this paint job.

3834 2018-09-05 16:35:25 @PervGriffin   I went to see a Doc about anxiety today. I could tell him more!!!!! I've researched so much! I taught him. He didn't tell me anything I didn't know ! I'm out of that cbd oil and feeing it!

3836 2018-09-05 16:35:11 Bija lotion coba cek de, dia oil free
3837 2018-09-05 16:35:07 Leave it in the ground. Burning more tar sands faster is not good for any human on Earth. Let #TMX die. Stop subsidizing oil companies with incorrect prices on carbon. Carbon taxes are necessary market corrections
3838 2018-09-05 16:35:06 We need a handy new catchall term for a certain group of ultra capitalist polluters and I think we should call them Carbon Criminals. Whether it's peat, bitumen, coal, oil, gas, wood, biomass, or anything else. Burning stuff is bad.
3839 2018-09-05 16:35:05 Oil $100 nice

3843 2018-09-05 16:34:45 Libyans are right to be suspicious of outside intervention, let's not forget Trump's comment 'We Should've Taken Libya's Oil'!!!!
Never mind the people or the country hey?

3845 2018-09-05 16:34:26 My second favorite most ignored topic is Genie Energy, which has Woolsey, Dick Cheney, and Bill Richardson, Larry Sumner's, and Mary Landrieu invested with...Rupert Murdoch, to drill for oil in the Golan Heights, Syria.
3846 2018-09-05 16:34:20 Oil! Moron
3847 2018-09-05 16:34:19 they probably replying w coconut oil all over their fingers
3848 2018-09-05 16:34:13 I would like to put one question to the west.  
After Gaddafi was ousted, from 2011, how much and to whom have they paid for Libyan oil?.
3849 2018-09-05 16:34:11 any hint on s400 & iran oil?
3850 2018-09-05 16:34:01 omg i almost set a kitchen on fire i was making pancakes, spilled oil on the hot stove and created a fire

3852 2018-09-05 16:33:52 If only Iran had oil fields nearby, or a pipeline to this supposedly new port. What they’ll have to do is shuttle tankers from deep in the gulf through the Straight of Hormuz to this new “safe“ port. Not the stupidest thing I’ve heard this week, but close. #geographysabitch
3853 2018-09-05 16:33:52 These muthafuckaz talking about 2 fucking hours for an oil change. What the fuck is the point of my appointment 
3854 2018-09-05 16:33:46 不安定になってきた
3855 2018-09-05 16:33:42 It is what they left out&didn't disclose in tweets&pressers really matters.Chinese army camp already footed in Afghanistan&Pakistan (CPEC) corridor means Iranian oil would have access to China, Pakistan, India and beyond.
3856 2018-09-05 16:33:32 Not upset about the rule change. In this poisonous partisan environment it was going to happen. Was never my point.
3857 2018-09-05 16:33:32 （*＾ ワ ＾*）.... Did you eat my chili oil?
3858 2018-09-05 16:33:22 Ingredients:

- 1/2 aloe vera jel
-1/2 tp of castor oil( if you don’t have castor oil you can use coconut oil)
- 1 vitamin E capsule
-a garlic clove
3859 2018-09-05 16:33:14 Fill me up with the oil, Noelle
3860 2018-09-05 16:33:12 I was wondering why Wendy wanted to take my car to Maine until I realized that she’s 22,000 miles OVERDUE for an oil change.
3861 2018-09-05 16:33:10 New CBD Oil Softgel Becomes Sales Leader as Hemp Sourced CBD Market Grows - Press Release
3862 2018-09-05 16:33:05 So 81,000 CR is deposited into the newly opened accounts. I guess government can use this money on reducing the fuel price. Government has to play their part in this until the crude oil prices are not lower down.
3863 2018-09-05 16:33:04 More oil! More oil!
3864 2018-09-05 16:32:52 *whines, shaking head* But, Daddy, I won't sparkle this much if the oil's gone!
3865 2018-09-05 16:32:51 Nope don't use oil at all. Just use salt and stir it every so often. Oil stays above water so I have no idea how it would stop anything from sticking. I use like a decent amount of salt before putting the pasta in. Later I just ringe my pasta and it's not salty.
3866 2018-09-05 16:32:44 Tell me why at my gym there are like a squad of dudes that look like they inject oil
3867 2018-09-05 16:32:23 İf u want to show your friendship lets start again berlin-Basra fast railroad u can use for oil gas and goods transportation are you ready?
3868 2018-09-05 16:32:16 While I agree the current Venezuelan PM seems a bit of a nutter. The demise of Venezuelan economy can be laid at the Americans door. Extracting revenge for the nationalisation of the oil industry I believe. Punitive sanctions.
3869 2018-09-05 16:32:12 That’s a concern. As oil is still the big player (and I guess coal is coming on line again in the US), I look at exploration of alternatives as harm reduction. Globally there is a lot of interest in tidal power..if the net change is “better than status quo” I have patience.
3870 2018-09-05 16:32:02 There is no confusion this is a carefully crafted plan by @gmbutts and @JustinTrudeau to keep oil sands oil in the ground as the two have previously stated.
3871 2018-09-05 16:31:46 Thanks! We used: jelly, vegetable oil, vinegar, baking powder, washing up liquid, water, food colouring and glitter. The children also brought in some of their own ingredients too.
3872 2018-09-05 16:31:44 @BizNasty2point0 just used your code for @UrbalActiv ! Thanks man! I'm loving cbd oil it's a game changer
3873 2018-09-05 16:31:44 Modiji has cleard huge loans to oil suppling countries,not taken any loans from world bank, tax collection has improved, so many new schemes for common man strengthened army ,no corruption cases against his ministry what more u want.Either ur blind r  suffering from heart burn
3874 2018-09-05 16:31:41 You cannot control rupee value, crude oil price and many other things, but you can definitely control yourselves and benefit from Mr. Market's mis-pricings of wonderful businesses.
3875 2018-09-05 16:31:38 Sending good vibes your way! Have you tried CBD oil? Might be worth a try 
3876 2018-09-05 16:31:38 Only in professional wrestling can you see a parade of penis people resurrect a baby oil covered Joey Ryan and he then comes back and destroys Adam Page with only his dick and a lollipop. #AllIn #BulletClub
3877 2018-09-05 16:31:37 I can’t believe people oil pull for 20 minutes +, my jaw is so sore after 5 minutes every time 
3878 2018-09-05 16:31:34 I gotta get an oil change moe
3879 2018-09-05 16:31:30 Recs needed! Those of you who've used CBD oil for your dog, what brand do you use? What should I avoid?

The vet's office suggested I should look into it for my Little Dog, who's suffering terribly from anxiety or neurological issues.
3880 2018-09-05 16:31:24 Case: tenants have pot of boiling oil on stovetop. Catches fire. Tenant uses extinguisher to put out fire. Entire unit filled with powder requiring clean-up at their cost. No tenant insurance. Had they burnt the apartment down they’d be in a very sorry position right now.
3881 2018-09-05 16:31:05 BTW Oil certs are very high up the list!
3882 2018-09-05 16:31:01 Do you know what Scotland's contribution to UK taxes is? Listen to Dennis Healey, look at the tricks Brown and Blair got up to, and find out how much oil is diverted to a fictitious 5th region of the UK
3883 2018-09-05 16:30:59 Plz see and examine that ground net oil be pure and available at a lower price..
3884 2018-09-05 16:30:48 No one has ever heard of anyone in the middle East getting rich off oil.
3885 2018-09-05 16:30:40 Unfortunately Hawaii (the state) has a large military base that is a constant consumer of fossil fuels.

Oil from Oahu is the backup provided for the grid on Hawaii (the island).

3894 2018-09-05 16:29:52 Issue them out some Metamucil or castor oil.
3895 2018-09-05 16:29:40 It was wonderful thank you. The chilli/garlic oil was excellent tasting too!
3896 2018-09-05 16:29:40 Want a clear conscience while tucking into your @Nestle @PepsiCo & @KFC? Then first tell palm oil regulator @RSPOtweets to suspend disgraced #palmoil company @Indofood
3897 2018-09-05 16:29:37 Lightly sauteeing, with a splash of organic olive oil? 
Microwaving at 20% power?
Placed on the double boiler, at a slow boil?
3898 2018-09-05 16:29:24 I think people greatly underestimate the US reach beyond the $USD. Oil is just one of the interests that they represent. Tech is another big one, and the West isn't comfortable with China's approach to dealing with it.
3899 2018-09-05 16:29:21 No you got elected by pandering to the masses, fear mongering, lying and being a snake oil salesman. Admit it.

3905 2018-09-05 16:29:03 Congress issued Oil Bonds to meet the subsidy burden.
3906 2018-09-05 16:28:54 The issue here the country which supports world terrorism Saudi Arabia, the country which supports IsIs not touchable by anyone due to the most oil-exporting country in the world.

Saudi Arabia the name of terror.
3907 2018-09-05 16:28:49 It may depend upon how the oil or gas is extracted. If fracking is causing serious problems we must act. Oil and gas are the only alternatives for oil and gas companies!
3908 2018-09-05 16:28:39 Sorry, meant 3rd primary wave not intermediate wave from 107 to 26 on oil..
3909 2018-09-05 16:28:38 Perhaps @Anna_Soubry and her fellow EU loving clown MP's should go out with some British Fisherman and experience being rammed ,having oil fired over their catch and even petrol bombs  thrown at them to experience how much the French love us #Brexit
3910 2018-09-05 16:28:30 The Bayou Bridge Pipeline is a 162.5-mile crude oil pipeline planned from Lake Charles, Louisiana to St. James, Louisiana by Bayou Bridge, LLC, a subsidiary of Energy Transfer Partners.   

ETP is the same group that brought you the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL).
3911 2018-09-05 16:28:27 "We did this for normal people," says @sveckert.  "You have these legit universities, and then you have these studies from snake oil sellers, and these studies are standing next to each other in one journal."
3912 2018-09-05 16:28:22 It was also to stop Saddam trading oil in Euros which would have threatened dollar/oil matrix. Either way you slice it oil was the lubricant for its assimilation by US military industrial complex. UK & pound led to bLIAR picking Bush over EU. The rest is, as they say, propaganda
3913 2018-09-05 16:28:15 dude looks like he spent a bag on some high grade cosplay and that hair? nah pimp. lookin like oil slick
3914 2018-09-05 16:28:13 GERS is about authorative as a copy of the beano. It's full of guesstimations and of course ignores little tricks like the 5th region of the UK where oil sold direct from the fields is allocated to 'made up region'

3920 2018-09-05 16:27:34 He worked with the CPC for a year and got shut out. Publicly humiliated for his beliefs and silenced. As for standing up for oil the Harper government couldn’t get the pipelines built with a majority. How is Scheer going to do it as official opposition?
3921 2018-09-05 16:27:24 time to dowse myself in peppermint oil and try not to flip out
3922 2018-09-05 16:27:19 $SLCA making a new low below $20 and closing green on the day would indicate a significant bottom.  At 4x ebitda it looks like a huge buy down here.  Pricing and supply will firm up at $70 oil.  Buy it here in low $20’s
3923 2018-09-05 16:27:14 in the coming months shale plays will go bankrupt causing the next american Crisis in between oil will spike to 100 for the last time ..... before we switch to an electric powered future .....

3928 2018-09-05 16:26:25 This is crazy. And to think that solar is supposed to be able to "stand on its own two feet" - imagine if the oil industry had to do that!
3929 2018-09-05 16:26:22 @POTUS Humanity needs to declare war on it's own extinction! STOP extraction of coal, oil, metals, water table for industry! Stop Space Program! Stop Nuclear! Go self-sustaining Green industry an economy of Protectors of All Life On Earth! Recycle all pollution into new products!
3930 2018-09-05 16:26:19 Get US the hell out of the middle east. War is not winnable and the only reason the US involves itself is to protect the flow of oil for cooperating regimes. Make higher education affordable so the military service for college carrot loses its appeal. Protect & cherish our own!
3931 2018-09-05 16:26:18 Discovery KCM, jamaa amebuy 5M, akaenda kuweka oil, ikawekwa excess. No dipstick, they have a gauge that reflects on the dashboard & it showed the oil was low. The car is smoking like hell as the engine dies a slow death. Life

3936 2018-09-05 16:25:36 Tweet clarification: Smelling the oil petrochemical; but the CO also in the oil by itself has no smell. Bottom line: all petrochemicals no matter what they are paired with chemically CAUSE health problems that conventional medicine chooses to ignore!

3946 2018-09-05 16:24:34 Long-term, we can't just keep literally selling the province out from under our feet, it... Just doesn't work. So many short-sited "BUT THE JERBS" arguments about our oil (And other extractive) industries here
3947 2018-09-05 16:24:27 A denial from a proven serial liar, fraud, and snake oil peddler.

Considering every book printed about the cesspool that is the Trump WH presents the same basic theme, your denials and those of your surrogates carry very little weight.
3948 2018-09-05 16:24:11 And there is oil under it and we are on 10% of sales.

3950 2018-09-05 16:23:57 @nikkihaley Iran is drawing its strength from Iraq as it steals the Iraqi oil money and this requires immediate action to confront Iran's influence in Iraq and prevent Iran's clients from controlling oil and the Iraqi Central Bank

3953 2018-09-05 16:23:48 I’ve been taking black seed oil with apple cider vinegar & honey for a few days & I already feel a difference in my energy level throughout the day.
3954 2018-09-05 16:23:46 It is amazing that instead of putting liquor in honey and oil bottles,  we should rather put oil and honey in liquor bottles to properly  camouflage the contents.

It is the same excuse for voting GEJ right?
Let's do the same to mr lifeless too.

Simple as ABC.
3958 2018-09-05 16:23:32 We in Alberta would be happy to pursue other trading partners.  We just need to be able to get the oil moving out of our province.  It would be nice if we had some assistance from the provinces which have previously benefited from Alberta oil.  LIKE ALL OF THEM!
3959 2018-09-05 16:23:24 @TimesNow SHEHZAD POONAWALA WHY U R NOT SHOWING YOUR MOBILE SCREEN indicating crude OIL & petrol diesel prices of last 14yrs? Have u courage? Why not showing papers on crude oil SUPPLY price & relatively petrol diesel prices of last 14yrs? Have u courage?Whom u represent?WHO pay?

3961 2018-09-05 16:23:13 Good. I hope he does derail it. That moment revealed a lot about Kavanaugh.
3962 2018-09-05 16:23:11 Sorry for U.S. Your legislators are about to add a 'Snake Oil Salesman' to your supreme court : effusive in the questions that benefit, squirming,  evasive, fudging and positively amnesiac over those that don't: One code for self - Judges others differently.
3963 2018-09-05 16:23:09 I need to get an oil change! maybe I’ll try to Saturday.
3964 2018-09-05 16:23:02 I'm bringing my boiling oil
3965 2018-09-05 16:22:41 They say at first people hated it when they struck black goo in the desert while they dug for water. Now they call that black goo crude oil
3966 2018-09-05 16:22:27 Trump hates oil over 70 because Trump loves winning in November.
3967 2018-09-05 16:22:19 Mam plz tell me how to use carrot seed oil for lips??

3969 2018-09-05 16:22:11 they were pointing out that the nigeria 20/20 vision requires 14% growth. Not that it was ideal. Many of their assessments are not relevant today as this was examined through the prism of oil which shale as made almost irrelevant

3971 2018-09-05 16:22:07 @SecPompeo China's economic rise requires America to secure Iraqi oil, raise Iraqi oil production to secure America's share of oil and raise oil prices to curb China's economic rise.
3972 2018-09-05 16:22:04 Najd isn't "usurped" as that's the land which spawned the al-Sauds in the first place! The Gulf lands full of oil on the other hand...
3973 2018-09-05 16:21:59 @AmbJohnBolton China's economic rise requires America to secure Iraqi oil, raise Iraqi oil production to secure America's share of oil and raise oil prices to curb China's economic rise.

3976 2018-09-05 16:21:46 I think u r not awared that we import oil
3977 2018-09-05 16:21:38 We are trying to push the globalist coalition into defending Turkey's Al Qaeda allies. Not as simple as country vs country. We might be backing Turkey. We might be backing a Russian oligarchs like Oleg Deripaska or trying to get oil/gas contracts from Cyprus. It's complicated
3978 2018-09-05 16:21:28 The mockery was based on predictions of -Gold to skyrocket, dollar to fall  on the launch of a gold backed yuan, no we mean gold convertible on the SGE, no we mean will create gold demand as oil producers will swap their yuan for gold and drain the LBMA
3979 2018-09-05 16:21:26 Fantastic and well deserved
3980 2018-09-05 16:21:19 LOL The little cups were the answer to men cooking - we didn't need to know about things like coating the pan with oil or lard! JK, it is the modern way of cooking. More waste, but less work :) I love them! (I'm always looking for the easy way!!!) 
3981 2018-09-05 16:21:07 @narendermodiPMO, Sir, ask the oil, gas and petroleum companies to reduce their administrative unproductive expenditures to minimum level to reduce burden on common man.
3982 2018-09-05 16:21:04 Drought, Climate Change, Crude Oil,  Currency Fluctuations, Water Shortage,  El-Nino, Gaming Tourism,.....but like all right wingers and Trump brigade let's blame #EWC.
3983 2018-09-05 16:21:02 Loans again? Is Nigeria not making any money at all from Agriculture, oil or other sectors of the economy?  How much is our debt profile now, who would settle these debts? How much was inherited as debts and how much do you intend to leave as debts?
3984 2018-09-05 16:20:49 Today I have mostly been getting high on an olbas oil inhaler. #ILoveHavingACold
3985 2018-09-05 16:20:39 Had a pretty bad reaction to sunflower butter this morning, so if anyone knows some popular foods with any type of sunflower seeds/oil/butter in them let a girl know because epi pens are back ordered for 3 months and I’m not trying to have my throat close 
3986 2018-09-05 16:20:35 お眠
3987 2018-09-05 16:20:32 I’m hanging out in bed like if I don’t have to go get an oil change and drive 2 hours to school. Let me get my ass up.
3988 2018-09-05 16:20:27 Taking my #Chevyvolt to get an oil change for the first time at @jiffylube and being told they never done an oil change on a volt before worries me. Gave them the car manual and specifically pointed out the oil specs. Now I sit praying they do it right.

3990 2018-09-05 16:20:10 Breakfast hash:

Diced potatoes, carrots, onion, and minced garlic. Add to bag with half a stick of butter and some olive oil.

190° for 1 hour.

Dump entire contents of bag into a cast iron pan. Fry until starting to brown. Add pulled pork, brown more, serve.
3991 2018-09-05 16:20:06 What's bad with train law, the combo of two inflationary policy: lowering of income tax, and the imposition of excise tax on oil.
3992 2018-09-05 16:19:47 They revamped animal testing for human products again. It’s crazy what Moroccan oil can do for these animals.
3993 2018-09-05 16:19:37 Kenapa kok harus pake cuka apel? Pengen nyobaa tp jarang jual cuka apel disini. Oh iya itu kalo pake milk cleaser bisa ga? Apa harus cleansing oil?

3995 2018-09-05 16:19:28 The axis of resistance will remain strong and steadfast no matter what foreign powers seeks to cut the life line of their struggle against western aggression in weak arab nations where their leaders will their souls for cheap oil money and betray their people
3996 2018-09-05 16:19:26 Soo...fuel shortage is caused by oil firms because the VAT laws interferes with their cut.

Can either be solved by doing away with VAT law or increasing prices at the pump. Which seems more likely to happen to you?
3997 2018-09-05 16:19:22 We won't be a big Club till we have an Oil field we was getting there with Fair Play rules now the loop holes have turned it back into who spend more Cups we big Club for running a Club right but in till we join Hall of Shame cash drugs we win nout
3998 2018-09-05 16:19:13 So what happens to the price of oil after the midterm elections when Iran won't be able to ship?
3999 2018-09-05 16:19:09 Should I continue to put on tanning oil or stop while in ahead?

4002 2018-09-05 16:18:54 Now, Govt have no point to defend on fall of Rupee and rise in oil price. Statements r given just to cover Govt loop holes & policy failure.

4006 2018-09-05 16:18:35 #IndiaAsksCongress why does Rahul Gandhi run down India & Indians whenever he goes overseas? why does the Congress party support the brains behind the Naxalites who pose as activists? y did Congress party bankrupt Indian Oil HPCL BPCL by 2014 & leave a petro debt of 2L crs?
4007 2018-09-05 16:18:32 @PepsiCo @Nestle @Pizza Hut & @TacoBell spend millions on their ‘ethical’ image & say they only use RSPO-certified #palmoil. But truth is @RSPOtweets gives the OK to destructive palm oil by brand @Indofood #savetheorangutans
4008 2018-09-05 16:18:25 At the moment nothing can replace oil for transportation. Also gas for hydro and industry is very cheap. Good news the USA has plenty of oil and gas, making it a very intersting place to invest in manufacturing. And the more the USA takes manufacturing from China, the better

4010 2018-09-05 16:18:16 That was for Sean, not you. The NFL is actively silencing peaceful protest and he claims there is hypocrisy because Alex Jones can’t spew his hateful propaganda and sell his snake oil, so ridiculous! And The Dude as your profile pic has my respect. Another great movie!
4011 2018-09-05 16:18:14 Do you have any idea how much the oil and gas industry is subsidized? 

The investment in emerging technology/clean energy did not almost bankrupt us. It's a pittance with regard to provincial spend, and while we have a high debt to gdp ratio, we are nowhere near bankrupt.

4015 2018-09-05 16:17:55 Yep, that sounds plausible, we can either trust Donald Trump, known casino bankrupter and failed snake oil diploma salesman, or Bob Woodward *checks notes* pulitzer prize winning journalist.
4016 2018-09-05 16:17:47 Blaz, 269x may or may not be excessive but in principle I'd say weird NOT to mention other fuels. Just checked IEA "Coal 2017". Mentions renewables, wind, oil etc each 20-odd times.
Re David's points, other than the Japan thing the differences were small (still maybe intriguing).
4017 2018-09-05 16:17:42 Put coconut oil first !
4018 2018-09-05 16:17:39 @SecPompeo Iraqi oil should be operated by the US intelligence and the American Embassy in Iraq to secure it and prevent Iran from taking it, America and Iraq are the ones who have the right to Iraqi oil
4019 2018-09-05 16:17:38 I can thoroughly recommend cherry juice (though it gives you some pretty wacky dreams). Natural source of melatonin, apparently. Otherwise lavender (or olbus oil) aromatherapy working for me right now.  He says.  Awake a 4am...  #Insomnia
4020 2018-09-05 16:17:38 Have you changed your oil recently?
4021 2018-09-05 16:17:38 I wonder why we are exporting all the raw materials that come with crude oil.  This oil should have been refined here.
4022 2018-09-05 16:17:37 Trump oil is poison!
4023 2018-09-05 16:17:28 @AmbJohnBolton Iraqi oil should be operated by the US intelligence and the American Embassy in Iraq to secure it and prevent Iran from taking it, America and Iraq are the ones who have the right to Iraqi oil
4024 2018-09-05 16:17:24 Go to a chicken shop in the UK. Some places cook the fries in the same oil as the chicken. Winning combo.
4025 2018-09-05 16:17:21 ยิ้มสดใสแล้วอ่ะ ดีใจ
4026 2018-09-05 16:16:59 Perhaps Congress should start considering to demand the removal of the president's economic team, also they should amend train law to add automatic suspension of oil excise tax when inflation breach 5 percent

4028 2018-09-05 16:16:42 I have to find the pic but it's a French oil paste that's called like A13? It's not concentrate d enough to give me a retinol purge but I've noticed the difference already
4029 2018-09-05 16:16:41 Sane people will understand why price of petrol was lower during NDA regime as excess was paid to repay to oil marketing companies and also use it for road building but are they any ?
4030 2018-09-05 16:16:38 How many times have we heard the oil industry tell us that their equipment is well regulated and frequently inspected, yet every year another ecological disaster happens somewhere in our country.  It’s time to stop pretending our planet is a renewable resource.
4031 2018-09-05 16:16:31 Coconut oil really the truth
4032 2018-09-05 16:16:16 It is true sir, no development despite a whooping oil booms

4034 2018-09-05 16:16:01 I feel like I’m ne of my recent posts tagging @TTSAcademy in regards to snake oil salesmen definitially got some attention - and I feel like I got the feedback on Elizondo’s recent Medium Post - either that or a pure coincidence occurred - either way thanks guys!
4035 2018-09-05 16:15:59 Good point.  Everyone always says Bs the problem, but Ramona’s doing crap like this but getting away with it.  I’m allergic to seafood and it’s so bad if other food is cooked in the same oil as fish, I get a reaction.
4036 2018-09-05 16:15:55 I don’t know what God is doing in this season, but I do know that the oil is produced after the pressure has been applied.
4037 2018-09-05 16:15:52 Finally found some pure CBD oil for my vapor.

4041 2018-09-05 16:14:59 Increase in National Debt, millions no longer health ensured,  children taken away from their parents, increase in domestic terrorism, plans to put oil rigs off South Carolina coast,  Putin elevated on world stage, Putin directed WH policy, lack of protecting elections. 
4042 2018-09-05 16:14:59 Glad the storm gone now I can get a OIL CHANGE!!
4043 2018-09-05 16:14:58 My CBD oil shipped today and I’m so beyond ready for it that I keep tracking it every 5 minutes.. Like it’s gonna make it come any faster. 
4044 2018-09-05 16:14:54 Increasing oil prices are directly proportional to increased transportation cost and eventually inflation.
4045 2018-09-05 16:14:51 It’s killing me to sit here and wait for a oil change to be done
4046 2018-09-05 16:14:36 भाई बुरा मत माने, ये बताए जब इंटरनेशनल मार्किट में oil सस्ता था और आधे दामो में बिक रहा था, तब अपनी इंडिया में कितना oil सस्ता हुआ??

4049 2018-09-05 16:14:22 JFK rigged elections via Chicago, Nixon surrounded by thugs, George W. Bush lied us into war for oil, contacts to Halliburton, death and destruction followed, he is now lauded by media, while #Mueller works to unhinge election of an establishment outsider which is Trump.

4065 2018-09-05 16:12:46 Try coconut oil!
4066 2018-09-05 16:12:43 “Con on the public.” YOU are the con man, sir. Thank God there are many of us who recognized your sleazy snake oil salesman tactics right from the beginning and refuse to succumb to your brainwashing. Sadly (see, I can use that word too), I actually enjoyed The Apprentice.
4067 2018-09-05 16:12:37 In 2013 mr.akshay kumar responded oil price is high so let's use bycycle now i confidend he is not riding his car he started bycycle becayse petrol price is very very high

4069 2018-09-05 16:12:26 as a former emo who damaged her hair in her teens who is now a blonde, i reccomend once a month soaking it in coconut oil. i also use spf spray, deep moisture conditioners and i brush my hair with the conditioner in and my hair isn’t dry at all! also dry your hair w a tshirt!
4070 2018-09-05 16:12:18 I know someone's more successful than me when what they put in their hair is better than my actual diet. Avocado, apple cider vinegar & coconut oil.
4071 2018-09-05 16:12:10 Whatever explanation you give but reality is that the government has completely failed to control oil prices.

4086 2018-09-05 16:10:46 For what? Iraq wasn't even a threat to America or the world or the region.... It was only about oil and control. Precious lives lost for greed and not freedom.
4087 2018-09-05 16:10:34 Still no reply to my question about vapor ware. These train cars don’t exist and neither do the ships. Solid bitumen left to cool becomes a solid like a road. If your calling this a solution I call fantasy. Then do we move oil or food and other commodities by rail
4088 2018-09-05 16:10:21 Unbelievable coming from a party which still sells Bhutto to gain sympathy vote. Look at the shambles around you and sort Sindh out. You can't distract the public from the honey and oil (and bhung in your dad's case) by issuing silly statements.

That requires us to leave oil reserves uncombusted and only used to process into necessary plastics. Same with LNG it has to stay in the ground.
4093 2018-09-05 16:09:47 #Palmoil giant @Indofood’s illegal abuse is well documented. @Nestle & @PepsiCo’s business partner uses child labour & has intimidated communities from their homes to make way for palm oil plantations. RT to pressure @RSPOtweets to stop certifying exploitation Indofood

4100 2018-09-05 16:08:55 NFLX puts were almost 10 baggers this morning....afraid to look what AMZN was.  Banks seem to be weighing on the bounce too, trading banks lately has been like trying to buy the dip in oil last year.
4101 2018-09-05 16:08:44 Mostly people here defending PMB excessive borrowing are northerners...cos 85% of the money borrowed was been channeled to them and later the oil producing states go they service the debts ......
4102 2018-09-05 16:08:43 Coming in early October, finally, I'll have 3 scent oil roll ons added to Etsy. :) Let me talk about them for a few.

4111 2018-09-05 16:07:37 And in today's episode of The Controversialist, I've started working on an article that sets out to refute the snake oil of Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell. I must be starting to feel better. But will probably never, ever be invited to any local poetry event again. :P

4115 2018-09-05 16:07:19 I know very little about Cameroon and didn't know you had oil. Is your government friendly to US business interests? Here's the thing... the US has a history of staging fake protests/revolutions as an excuse to overthrow govts they don't like. Iran, Chile, Ukraine, Syria...
4116 2018-09-05 16:07:18 Yes I work in a steel plant with heat traps everywhere and no AC.  Three welding depts, CNC machinery, hydraulic oil, a plasma burn table.  Plus I work 10 hr days.  It’s a good job but summers like this one you pay for it.  Hope you are enjoying retirement!  You’ve earned it
4117 2018-09-05 16:07:15 @PMOIndia @narendramodi @gssjodhpur @RadhamohanBJP @FinMinIndia please increase custom duty on edible oils before new Kharif crop arrival in MP and Rajasthan to benefit farmers on time or else it will happen like Gujarat last year international price of oil is lowest of 5 years
4118 2018-09-05 16:07:05 De acuerdo. Cruzó la frontera muy seguido y es una gran verdad los de oil están casi regalados y los planes para comprarlos no se diga. Y México quiere hacer refinerías. Me río de Janeiro. Ni modo es la transformación para atrás. Bendiciones.

4120 2018-09-05 16:06:52 We can't even compare the two. Their situation was more than crazy stupid.
A net oil exporter, subsidized fuel, etc...
4121 2018-09-05 16:06:52 Np And then still just put a little oil or something after you wash it to keep it moisturized
4122 2018-09-05 16:06:44 We need both - we need to get off Saudi oil - your survey needed another option - both
We also need another refinery.
To all the purists who think we can live without oil products try living for even a month without them.
4123 2018-09-05 16:06:37 If only a country was sitting on top of a bunch of oil?

4132 2018-09-05 16:05:16 will someone go to the oil change with me  :/
4133 2018-09-05 16:05:10 you can sure as F smell burning oil which contains CO

if you are smelling it you’re breathing it
4134 2018-09-05 16:05:05 Most of the reasons are in the studies of economic freedom.

Norway is oil rich.

4138 2018-09-05 16:04:38 But for real we have cbd oil for my dog because he’s a grumpy old bastard who will fight anyone for food no matter whether he’s hungry or not.

4157 2018-09-05 16:02:00 An air fryer produces crisp, moist food without the need for a deep fryer or large amounts of oil. If avoiding saturated fats and heavily fried foods is on your list of dietary priorities, then using an air fryer instead of a deep oil fryer is clearly the way to go!

4160 2018-09-05 16:01:35 You are climbing up your own bum here.

You are living in a bizarre entrenched Yoon  cloud cuckoo land of superiority and power
4161 2018-09-05 16:01:34 You not a business man I can see. Trust me most business person will prefer to share the business risk. Apart from that the loan is going to be along term payment plan.

4165 2018-09-05 16:01:08 I'm super confused because I read up all about the best oils to use for cooking and they all seemed to say coconut oil - this overturns it all!

4185 2018-09-05 15:59:58 When I tell people that Buhari is worse than Abacha. He is criminally minded using family/friends as proxies to steal, they always don't believe me. At the PTF he used his, his wife's senior to siphon #25b. At the NNPC 1977 it was £2.8m at that time. Buhari came for oil money.
4186 2018-09-05 15:59:58 Michael Mania, Turkana oil has not been exploited to levels to significantly contribute to national economy. So, our oil from Turkana has not come into the distribution lines. That's why negotiations on sharing of proceeds is still being done. The twit from DP, is about revenue

4197 2018-09-05 15:58:24 It's about money. They've discovered oil reserves off the coast of Nicaragua so now they're overthrowing the govt and installing a puppet who will be friendly to US oil interests. It's happened many times before. Cameroon has nothing the US wants so they don't give a damn.

4220 2018-09-05 15:56:34 For glossy hair:

- 2 bananas
- 2 tp of honey
-1/2 tp of coconut oil

Blend the bananas and mix well 
with the other ingredients after that apply hair mask and wait  about 15 minutes with it before washing it out can be used 3 times a week
4221 2018-09-05 15:56:21 You can roast it in the oven at about 425 for about 15 -20 minutes on a sheet pan with olive oil and salt and pepper
4222 2018-09-05 15:56:05 Wow. We can really see how well those supplements and snake oil is working.
4223 2018-09-05 15:56:04 My father was a painter, so I love all the names of colors used in oil paints! My favorite was alizarin crimson. I always pictured that small, wiggly red lizard crawling around on the canvas. Cerulean has beautiful sounds, good name for a character in a fantasy story.
4224 2018-09-05 15:55:56 2/2 But anyone who thinks studying crash retrieval materials is going to get anti-gravity or the key to zero point is vaping some heavy 420 oil. It will be FUNDAMENTAL principles we need to learn. It's not unlike how my lab dissects molecular biology. Tiny steps of understanding.
4225 2018-09-05 15:55:33 Yo I hate when mechanics bring out parts of your car and are like “This is what a new one looks like, and this is your gross dirty broken piece of shit. Wanna pay 120 extra dollars??” And I’m like nahhhh bitch just change my oil
4226 2018-09-05 15:55:29 Besides focusing on plantation, I strongly believe that we can do something to increase #PalmOil milling efficiency and improve its bottom line. As such, we can improve oil yield per hectare as a whole.
4227 2018-09-05 15:55:22 Teachers in Oklahoma have not had a raise in 10 years.  Oil magnates get tax breaks every year.  So, yeah.  Parents are sick of it.  There’s a reason Gov. Fallon is so unpopular.

4230 2018-09-05 15:55:07 bcuz honest 2 god I think a double-baked potato skin is one of the most yummiest things in all of creation. Maybe some olive oil and pepper, but only a light brushing to give it lift

4236 2018-09-05 15:54:19 @PukkaPies mono sodium glutamate really! Full of flavour really? You don’t need #flavour enhancer if you use #ingredients with flavour. Palm oil is immoral also. You’ve lost a customer big time. Shame on you. #poison #food #health #PalmOil #artificial #gourmet #Guardian

4238 2018-09-05 15:54:12 Someone like KimaniEk, the oil we have has not even been exploited. From your facial appearance, if the picture is yours indeed, I expect better advice from you, not what you have posted here, unless you were a just a manual worker there.

4241 2018-09-05 15:53:46 How about you start moving the military back to USA? And leave Pakistan to its people? since the demand of oil is less now. These people need to eat start eating three meals
4242 2018-09-05 15:53:32 I AM SO TIRED OF SEEING THESE WOMEN SUGGEST ESSENTIAL OILS TO PEOPLE WITH SICK CHILDREN. IF YOU HAVE A SICK INFANT, TAKE THEM TO THE DOCTOR AND DO NOT LATHER THEM UP IN SOME OIL THAT ISNT EVEN APPROVED BY THE FDA. 

Thanks for coming to my ted talk.
4243 2018-09-05 15:53:32 That's the thing. People can't use a glitch if they don't know about it. One person doing it sucks but wouldn't warrant an immediate fix. 1000000 people doing it ruins the entire game. But a good glitch can make a lot of money. Digital gold. It's like striking oil.

4246 2018-09-05 15:53:29 I eat it all the time. It's highly refine and the oil is heated to such a high temp that it breaks down any residual protein
4247 2018-09-05 15:53:24 I just roast them w/ olive oil and different seasonings. I recently used everything but the bagel from Trader Joe’s and some Parmesan cheese
4248 2018-09-05 15:53:24 Yes girl! Nizoral. 
On Amazon, Walmart & Walgreens. 

For a stronger dose, have to go to a dermatologist. 

If she's natural or like me (virgin hair, never had a perm but I use heat- blow drying & hard press every 2 weeks), shampoo every 2 weeks & hot oil treatment every 4 weeks
4249 2018-09-05 15:53:23 Also you may want to do some research all oil companies are in the middle East and will stay there it is about profit and that line of bullshit is just that bullshit it is how they get dummies side
4250 2018-09-05 15:53:11 No hard basis to say this, but if anything oil demand elasticity has gone down. It is an increasingly lower share of wallet. 

Compare to relative prices in 70's
4251 2018-09-05 15:53:10 @mobrosgrooming 

Guys, talk to me. Your latest blog post days I can use both beard balm & oil multiple times each day!?

Should I alternate or use both at the same time?

4254 2018-09-05 15:52:50 Mr. President, there is not going to be nuclear war in the Mid-East because the oil will become contaminated. Putin wants to steal the oil by use of conventional forces piecemeal until he rules. We need to react to this extreme threat, before it is too late.

4275 2018-09-05 15:51:14 If you think "China has colonized Africa/Nigeria" - go and read Wikileaks.

After reading Wikileaks, you'd wonder whether Nigeria is a colony of Western Oil and Gas companies - who have the ear of US diplomats (who act as agony uncle/aunt to our major politicians).
4276 2018-09-05 15:51:12 The moni jona borrowed was used for wat. While enough moni was left 4him in the treasury. oil price was at its highest price wit 2.2million barrels.

4277 2018-09-05 15:51:12 I'm not comforted by a SCOTUS nominee who sits there and quotes from his Bible but can't tell us if he thinks a president can pardon himself or be subpoenaed.

4285 2018-09-05 15:50:58 I knew he would sell off our environment for $$ oil, gas and mining. Had no idea he would steel children away from their mothers and put them in cages.

4289 2018-09-05 15:50:27 So, running around saying everything will be great, we'll have 0 debt, we'll have all the oil... Until we sit down to discuss it all, it's all bullshit and wishful thinking.

4293 2018-09-05 15:49:56 Check oil too.
4294 2018-09-05 15:49:47 I take it in oil form during the day.  I do vape CBD too with a small thc content in the evening and 2 puffs before yoga, my life has been transformed.  It's all trial and error, we are all different.  Depression is the shitters, so whatever works.
4295 2018-09-05 15:49:47 She brought down democratically elected government because wife of Conservative politician Karamarko, earned 60 000 kunas (less than 10 000euros) 3-4 years before in businesses dealings with lobbyist of Hungarian oil company that owns Croatian oil company. Big deal!?!?

4297 2018-09-05 15:49:32 And Canada does refine its own oil, however it's easier to buy petroleum from the US for certain region (East Coast) than it is to get it from Western Canada

4299 2018-09-05 15:49:11 You're reporting it as if this govt can stop the rains and typhoons that hit the country during the recent months causing food products hit its price to the ceiling not to mention the rising world price of crude oil.
4300 2018-09-05 15:49:03 Thank you @mpob_tweets for the great effort and initiative. Perhaps, we can also encourage palm oil mills to produce their own #biodiesel using palm sludge oil as feedstock. Biodiesel produced can be fed into diesel generator set or heavy vehicles.

4305 2018-09-05 15:48:20 India will compromise on trade as it enjoys $25 billion surplus but on other issues like buying oil from Iran and A400 surface to air missiles from Russia any strategic considerations India will not budge as article correctly points out.Thats always been India & Modi nationalism.
4306 2018-09-05 15:48:10 @WhitePlainsCJD came in at 7:30 am oil change & inspection.  12 noon and still waiting.   Say service sucks.   Doubtful next lease will come from here
4307 2018-09-05 15:48:04 What? Mineral oil? I'd be inclined to talk to trading standards.. surely that's being misrepresented? 
4308 2018-09-05 15:48:02 How could congress kept the price of petrol and diesel below 80rs and 70rs when the rate of crude is above 100$?

4311 2018-09-05 15:47:56 Most upsetting thing about this too many still can't see there isn't a big difference between Rubio and Jones, both believe in the same things and both are snake oil con artists.
4312 2018-09-05 15:47:51 Wow...coconut oil?!? I use coconut  milk all the time in my coffee but never tried oil?? Interesting 
4313 2018-09-05 15:47:49 If that is the case then you better build the trans mountain pipeline instead of shipping the oil to the states.
4314 2018-09-05 15:47:39 Yes I agree, it could get more messy, I have prepared myself for that possibility and although it would be very uncomfortable I am confident in oil strikes in the long run so would have to just wait it out if it got worse in the short term.

That 6.4% inflation rate has triggered me.

Oil price has spiked worldwide but why is PH is the only country is SEA that has that inflation rate? Like twice the rate from the 2nd rank in SEA.

4326 2018-09-05 15:46:33 Instead of going to war I think we should play sports against each other to work it out. Imagine a war ship pulling up to the middle east and out jumps Lebron saying " bring out your best players, we're about to ball for your oil".

4343 2018-09-05 15:44:32 Forget the oil. A sensible Government would leave it where it is. Our planet is already dying, thanks to an overabundance of fossil fuel use. I don't think you can count on it bringing Scotland billions.
4344 2018-09-05 15:44:31 In this day and age of economic turmoil and uncertainty every little bit counts. So please help Canada get a better deal on oil and natural gas prices.
4345 2018-09-05 15:44:28 Oil spill?? We produce CNG and LNG, viable exports. Do you know what they are?You are way out of your depth, you should stop while you’re behind. Tariffs?

That said, CBD oil based products are super easy to get here now that our state legalized them. I might have to swing by a store one weekend.

4437 2018-09-05 15:36:58 Simple maths. Most of the UK used to be forest. The UK is now 70% farmland. Ergo, deforestation for farmland caused mass habitat loss. If palm oil isn't vegan because it destroys habitats, agricultural products aren't vegan either.

4497 2018-09-05 15:31:00 Yep. Had a partner that Legacy meant anything built prior to 1990 and didn’t have a network connection on it. Oil and gas don’t move as fast as some other industries. Around here legacy means 5 years in some cases.

I work 60 plus hours a week in my normal job and if I am going to focus just on oil I need to not try and get cute and trade at work. So I need to learn the 5-11 time frame flow
4511 2018-09-05 15:30:00 So, I was tired and grumpy and mean and my skin is just dry n sh** 

1) I slept in yesterday, no bath, no book, no coffee (!) and I'm OK now 

2) starting a new regime for skin, cleanse with aloe, tone with rose water & steam in castor oil ... 

The rest we'll tackle slowly

4513 2018-09-05 15:29:52 Norway has oil. That's why they're rich. Everything of value to the UK, successive governments (Tory AND Labour) handed away free to enrich themselves. Time for change. BIG change.

4519 2018-09-05 15:29:15 If she’s interested in engineering Kelly, ensure she’s exposed to it. In the 1990s I needed 2 graduate engineers; we interviewed quite a few and I selected the best two. Both were female. Unfortunately, one left after 18 months to go on the oil rigs; the other had baby. /2
4520 2018-09-05 15:29:04 One person littering barely has a detectable effect on the environment, so I guess everyone should just throw all their trash on the ground. Canada exports a lot of oil and our citizens pollute a lot. A climate plan requires initiative on these fronts for the greater good.

4540 2018-09-05 15:26:50 "oil paint" and "quick dry" are outdated comparisons when news, information, opinions, and advertisements all move at the speed of light. The internet never forgets and is always watching.

4542 2018-09-05 15:26:34 Absolutely true! Oil constitutes majority of our import bills and the incumbent govt. had to repay dues to Iran, of 2013-'14. If every policy created by the UPA ruptured during the NDA's tenure, it isn't wrong to apply the same logic to every tragedy that took place. Isn't it?

4632 2018-09-05 15:17:17 Eti ERC  calculated the oil price wrongly! In essence,  you're enjoying a lower fuel tariff. #Tukofarmorenjaa?
4633 2018-09-05 15:17:09 おめでとう（ビンタ
4634 2018-09-05 15:16:48 Congrats Robby, you are great racer, ambassador of our sport and a good person. God speed in your recovery and looking forward to seeing you back in a car soon.
4635 2018-09-05 15:16:47 Oil marketers and dealers margins were not factored in by ERC prices after VAT, speculation is rife in the industry as Uhuru might reverse treasury's action. Why buy fuel to sell at a higher price when chances are they might drop again? Will you sell at a loss? @albert_mwamburi
4636 2018-09-05 15:16:45 Yes! Progress. But it's so slow. My best friend works in the oil and gas field, and when she interviewed for her job, she was asked if she could handle doing night shifts with men.

My friend had already held a supervisor position. Often over men twice her age.
4637 2018-09-05 15:16:35 In Kenya,we produce oil, export it to be refined then import it again to use it...when did the rain start beating us?
What happened to our local companies?
The likes of Kikomi?
What we have are an excuse of leaders.If you don't like it, go shove it up where the sun doesn't shine.
4638 2018-09-05 15:16:31 Went in for a oil change, left with two new tires. Pobre de mí.
4639 2018-09-05 15:16:29 Scott, these" Party of Trump Puppets" all need to be Replaced.
They're "Blind Support " for such a Mindless,  Narcistic Snake Oil Salesman,  is F ing Pathetic and UN-AMERICAN.

4645 2018-09-05 15:16:14 I've been trying to wrap my head around how to disentangle recently high GDP growth due to asset value expansion and expected future asset value expansion from GDP growth due to "fundamentals" (everything else).
I mean, I know how to pull apart oil price effects and GDP/GNP...
4646 2018-09-05 15:16:11 skskdjjsk fry rice, chopped kimchi, the liquid thats with the kimchi, soy sauce, spam or ham maybe, in oil; and after frying all that together- add sesame oil, and if you want fried egg on top // yeah not the best directions but lol thats how i make it and it tastes good so

4652 2018-09-05 15:15:40 Off line, this is a common attribute of comms media. For example oil paint stays malleable for long enough to mix and apply it, but after a few days it dries locking in the decisions you made and perserving them so the work can be transported (and shared).
4653 2018-09-05 15:15:37 Best way for product manager to work with sales is to not be like President Trump and sell snake oil to well meaning customers.
4654 2018-09-05 15:15:29 And what better way to preserve England, than by selling off her national treasures, so they can be hidden away in some oil sheiks private collection, never to be seen by the English public again?!

I feel so biased but so many GOP make me ill. Cant help it. I do kinda like john Kasich. He doesnt have that snake oil salesman aura.
4658 2018-09-05 15:15:06 Can sniffing #rosemary increase your memory? The study by Northumbria Univ concluded that exposure to it can boost memory. They found that students working in a room containing the aroma of it -in the form of essential oil - achieved between 5 to 7% better results in memory tests

4665 2018-09-05 15:14:30 Our CBD oil has turmeric in it, and I think it tastes good. Maybe if you add some of that it will taste better? Or maybe some peppermint oil?

4680 2018-09-05 15:12:56 You mean the mixed economies like Denmark & Sweden that favor more market or capitalist views or do you mean Venezuela to the Soviet union where socialism failed.or Marxist like Cuba.let me guess Norway?one word, oil! And state capitalism. Norway #23, US #18, heritage foundation
4681 2018-09-05 15:12:53 Indeed. The idea of tying the $ and oil was a good idea specially with the petro$ recycling when OPEP countries  agreed to reinvest their surplus in US treasury bills, allowing the US to have debt at virtually no cost. But this has been abused as the current debt proved.
4682 2018-09-05 15:12:46 Sex robot porn movie now being filmed is touted as the next big thing. Yeah, nothing like watching a robot get an oil job.

4699 2018-09-05 15:10:31 Turn down the tap on oil exports to the US!  Canada is the biggest source of imported oil to the US.  Create a shortage at the gas pumps!  Consumer anger may get better results at the NAFTA table!

4730 2018-09-05 15:07:36 1/2 Um, no and NO. The reason 2018 RINs prices are low is low BOHO spread: soyBean Oil is getting kiled by tarrifs and Heating Oil (diesel) has gone up slowly . Therefore, blend cost of Biodiesel has been down, therefore low D4. 2018 D6 is off D4, playing the 50% spread it does

4744 2018-09-05 15:05:49 This one weak me..lmao
4745 2018-09-05 15:05:28 Are you saying the carbon tax is the cause for leading the country in growth? Can you substantiate that? Also, that doesn’t say much for the rest of Canada. Alberta’s growth is due to stronger oil prices and that’s it. Given the oil prices, the province is doing quite poorly.
4746 2018-09-05 15:05:23 There is a promo with the oil kings. Lots of fun and fairly well run. There are just timing issues with operating kids hockey around big league games.
4747 2018-09-05 15:05:14 This conspiracy plan done by RG 2 years back itself. Oil companies will reduce production so that it will hit Modi govt. We defeated Atalji for onion, which was again plotted conspiracy by Cong. Let's not repeat. Keep calm, considering major developments.

4764 2018-09-05 15:03:13 A good read - thank you!  But profit is not always evil.  The chance to make a better mousetrap and be rewarded for it drives innovation.  There will still be snake oil/homeopathy salesmen, but don't kill the goose that lays the golden egg (if I may mix metaphors!)

4772 2018-09-05 15:02:09 Every season demands another level of grace, every level of oil demands another crushing..if hes crushing you hes preparing you for something new!
4773 2018-09-05 15:02:04 In my socialist utopia there would be a major cut down on things such as commodity production that harms the environment, lower dependency on oil and an increase in renewable energy. Oh, and there’d be no government either. Read my bio next time you assume something about me.

4775 2018-09-05 15:01:51 The reason behind the devastation of Oranguttans is deforestation and for palm oil production we let them homeless. But its the best time to repent for what we have done to this poor creatures, therefore we have to try for creating a new habitat for Orangtns do you agree?

4778 2018-09-05 15:01:37 I would use at least an 8 oz, possibly 16 oz bottle for this as that is a lot of oil and a little bit goes a long way.  I would add a pinch of sea salt too, helps keep the oil emulsified, but still shake well before spraying!
4779 2018-09-05 15:01:31 It will be built in sensitive coastal environments,.and it will require expensive maintenance. It's a perfect example of the impractical nonsense that attracts funding. 
Don't compare it to oil. Compare it to solar, wind, and nuclear.

4796 2018-09-05 15:00:05 No it’s probably real. In your socialist utopia are there going to be no more fossil fuels? Or would the government controlling who burns the oil affect the environment the exact same way?

4817 2018-09-05 14:58:09 The value of "green energy" is far less than you think. Domestic coal and oil prevents the U.S. from being dependent on OPEC countries, which were able to crash our economy once upon a time.
4818 2018-09-05 14:58:09 You're very good at deflection. You have made exactly ZERO points about anything in the original tweet. You went straight to the President, meaning you have nothing of true value to offer beyond being a slightly entertaining distraction.

4856 2018-09-05 14:54:45 Oil drops below $78 as supply concern eases, demand worries mount: Oil fell below $78 a barrel on Wednesday as a U.S. Gulf tropical storm weakened and moved away from oil-producing areas and concern about weakening global demand added downward pressure.

4913 2018-09-05 14:49:56 Sadly, that’s true
Very true 
And our thoughtful leaders of time past did a lovely job of saving the excess money we got from crude oil after benchmarking... 

But let’s keep it up, we just might get it right
4914 2018-09-05 14:49:53 If oil is going to be used then why not oil that supports Canadian jobs and pays for Canadian medicare and Canadian social services?
4915 2018-09-05 14:49:45 $OKTA $NFLX $NTNX - all getting pummeled right now.   Time to get an oil change.  Hope it all rallies when I get back
4916 2018-09-05 14:49:43 The technology to end oil dependency is here now, today. What is lacking is the political will. Kudos to Jagmeet and the NDP for their courage in standing up to the Lib-Con big oil, alt-reality, anti-science, anti-innovation hucksters.
4917 2018-09-05 14:49:40 I did. But I’ve been an Oil fan for long enough to know that only time will tell how a season will go  hopefully there’s a couple of Canadian teams in the playoffs this season tho, it would be a nice change!
4918 2018-09-05 14:49:36 Trump's plan to sanction Iranian oil exports in Nov. will create a significant global oil-supply decline.

4933 2018-09-05 14:48:16 I have no idea. Never seen anything like this, especially considering how strong oil has been rallying as of late. At this point it's undervalued and oversild, but unfortunately it doesn't mean it's done its sell off.
4934 2018-09-05 14:47:55 And I keep a bottle of Dawn dish soap (the stuff used to clean rescued waterfowl after oil spills) handy.  Diluted with water, in a spray bottle, it's a great degreaser.  Also useful for cleaning the garage floor after gas/oil spills.

We can't accommodate the VLCCs due to our water being too shallow. So for the same quantity of product it costs about 4x as much to ship. Not counting for extra time cost.

The Coconut Oil industry did not donate millions to the American Heart Association as did so many of the other oil producers. It is purely retaliatory. Coconut oil is VERY healthy and beneficial.

The crack spread is favourable to heavy oil refineries making them more profitable, in addition to making more valuable products with less waste. $80 break even, 4x shipping costs?

4999 2018-09-05 14:42:35 It turns out that only a small portion of the world's oil is from fossils. The majority of oil is abiotic. Oil is continually being replenished as a natural process. That's why oil fields, when left 2 recover, yield fresh new oil. U have been seriously handicapped by their scam.

And if you're going for a soft yolk, just put a lid on the pan. The trapped heat will cook the egg whites without flipping it.
5020 2018-09-05 14:40:57 Well, perjorative "tar sands" aside, that article agrees with our point. Diluted bitumen is processed at refineries designed for heavy oil (because that's what diluted bitumen is). High conversion refineries are better with heavy oil. More of the valuable products, less waste.

5041 2018-09-05 14:38:15 U.S. heading for an oil crisis by year's end. $4 a gallon. Thank you Donald Trump.
5042 2018-09-05 14:38:15 Remember to also tell us how much your boss met in foreign reserve and the balance he left. We will like know how  much a  Nigerian worth during the oil boom.
5043 2018-09-05 14:38:09 You are right, Train law just accelerate this. This law has been passed too early. For market, they are announcing very bad things since a moment... So wouldn't be surprised to have again a 2008 year. For oil, price was very low, it was a matter of time before increase.

5045 2018-09-05 14:38:07 Had discussion with Palm Oil campaigner recently - surprisingly they said better to use certified sustainable palm oil than replacing with other. Alternative oil creates new problem. Would love to see fact-led partisan discussion about best option
Clearly consuming less is best

5051 2018-09-05 14:37:25 Please. It’s far from any kind of poison. While it shouldn’t be eaten like candy, it is far healthier than all the corn the US pushes. Corn, Canola and vegetable oil are MUCH worse culprits for poor health than coconut oil.
5052 2018-09-05 14:37:11 Me: I WILL NOT BUY THAT BRAND OF PEANUT BUTTER, IT HAS HYDRODGENATED OIL IN IT

5060 2018-09-05 14:36:34 Louisiana has laws outlawing protest, specifically protesting against oil pipelines. They CALL it "vital infrastructure," but it's meant to protect Energy Transfer Partners and make protesting them a felony! Seems like a job for the 9th Circuit Court!

5065 2018-09-05 14:36:09 Precisely, Mr. Maguire.These two are not yet charged, Nadine. Do not go off the handle at 600 million people, over 11 time zones with all the resources of uranium,oil, gas etc. we cannot sanction.LET WISDOM PREVAIL in Mrs. May's version of the Weimar Republic.( That was good!)
5066 2018-09-05 14:36:03 Are you sure thats really the problem? How about all the oil companies paying off car manufacturers to not make more efficient cars? Maybe if the CEOs were sleeping on the floors they would actually make something innovative. I want a $35k electric car from every manufacturer.

5090 2018-09-05 14:32:40 lol 'entourage oil' all good extracts should contain the full cannbinoid spectrum or entourage, adding the word entourage is just a gimmick to entice people in thinking they have a superior product. All our products are full spectrum oils.
5091 2018-09-05 14:32:29 Can someone who owns 10 yachts enter the kingdom of God? No, of course not. It would be easier for an oil tanker to pass through the eye of a needle.

5136 2018-09-05 14:28:25 I recon this is coming to light now because the oil execs know the period of cheap oil is coming to an end and they're diversifying their portfolios; I have no doubt Exxon, Shell, BP ect. already have a thousand patents filed for these technologies.

5158 2018-09-05 14:27:18 #aaog don't know what I'm doing with this. I hold still, I agree the rns is vague and unsettling but I will hold and see what comes. The oil is certainly there and good long term so hope what ever the issue is  it is not serious. 50/50 I'd say, I'm holding and will find out
5159 2018-09-05 14:27:02 The middle class does not see why they should call out the IOCs; they would rather go after MTN, DSTV, Krispy Kreme etc; they don't worry about Oil Marketers/NNPC/Discos/Private Schools costs; they love to focus on the things that matter less to their daily existence and pockets

5173 2018-09-05 14:25:35 Did exactly that with my son and mates a few years back! Stayed in railway carriage Crowne-Plaza, visited Lucas Oil football stadium, watched local baseball game, ate at fun Slippery Noodle Inn, watched Fri evening race at half mile Lucas Oil Raceway 10 miles west #epictrip

5207 2018-09-05 14:22:38 Yes, we use 'fracking' as shorthand for all extreme energy techniques and it's very effective. Unconventional oil and gas development is a bit of a mouthful as I'm sure you will agree.

5221 2018-09-05 14:21:12 2/ Mr Singh.  Maybe it would be useful for you to focus on practical detailed solutions from CDN Oil profits:  $ for CHG sequestration tech, $ for salmon habitat (whales need food)  $ for renewable's tech.   All these things can be done from moving CDN oil to the market.
5222 2018-09-05 14:21:06 Yes, better to bring them to a mixed martial arts match. Ranting is like pissing into a hurricane at this point. We need Red Adair to blow out this oil fire.

5225 2018-09-05 14:20:49 Consumer demand is interesting. I question whether the market been sufficiently open/free of vested interests in order to allow reduction in demand? There is mass movement for divestment but not carbon tax perhaps because latter allows oil companies to defer/delay responsibility.

5246 2018-09-05 14:18:49 Dilibit is a simple heavy oil, it can be refined in any heavy oil refineries with cokers (that would be every one). you appear to think dilbit is not a typical heavy, in that you are wrong.
5247 2018-09-05 14:18:49 There are lots of regional variations but the one to which I belong is just chickpeas, garlic, lemon juice, tahini, with olive oil more as a garnish than an ingredient, & paprika & parsley for decoration.
5248 2018-09-05 14:18:43 World oil consumption will reach 100 million barrels/day by the end of this year - "much sooner than we all earlier projected", says OPEC  Secretary-General Mohammad. What weakening demand?
5249 2018-09-05 14:18:39 I don’t wash it every day but I do condition every day. I will also “style” (twist out my curls) with a little leave in conditioner and mist with a coconut oil spray.
5250 2018-09-05 14:18:32 Just to clarify, instant oil change places are the best option and idk why more places don’t do it this way. Staying in your car is the best. No dirty waiting area, no greasy dudes adjusting your seat and smudging your interior, etc

5263 2018-09-05 14:16:37 It was an opportunity to prove him wrong and I don’t know maybe show respect to a father of a dead child given how we now know more a about his car pool dad and coach life than his legal work but whatever.

5265 2018-09-05 14:16:32 Thankfully we have oil, natural resources, whisky exports etc to bring in some revenue to the country and pay for nice things like education. You have failed holiday resorts like Blackpool. I think it’s nice we still give the English handouts, supporting our neighbours.
5266 2018-09-05 14:16:23 Every point in that Thread is debatable.
Low Oil prices, good monsoons for last 4 years helped Govt in controling inflation and maintaining CAD. 
Nothing much happened on Liberalisation , economic administrative reforms, Corporate Tax rates,

5277 2018-09-05 14:15:32 You have to differentiate between ‘fracking’ and oil/gas exploration. There is a difference. Generally people call all land based exploration fracking when it actually isn’t.

5280 2018-09-05 14:15:16 Yes we have cashflow to repay. 
Is it sustainable? It depends on oil exports for now till we effectively diversify our economy.

5323 2018-09-05 14:11:23 Well, with their sovereign wealth fund from North Sea oil, I guess they figure it's money well spent if it keeps the Russians from contaminating everything.
5324 2018-09-05 14:11:21 What’s up? Has Canada said they don’t want their doommonger-in-chief smoke and miiror snake oil salesman back on its side pf the pond? They have enough problems without him devaluing the Canadian$ and his total miserable negativity.
5325 2018-09-05 14:11:15 A few headchoppers are not important to them if in play is a threat to their 17yr old mercenary business. I wonder when they'll be reassigned from oil to "liberating" lithium mines.

This move would in theory allow Iran to continue exporting oil even if the Strait was closed. Prepping military ops? @vtchakarova
5353 2018-09-05 14:09:40 We should have taken Iran's oil. We could lower the gas prices and help save money for our crunchy roll subscriptions.

5392 2018-09-05 14:05:07 Peter Drucker famously said “What gets measured, gets managed”.

Oil is the is the big story, pulling back due to stronger USD and easing of weather threat in the Gulf. @amazon hits trillion$ market cap a month after @apple. @theranos is to be wound up, with investors losing  $1B
5443 2018-09-05 13:59:04 Vegan meat substitutes have gotten very good in the past 5 years, so taste-wise it's not a big deal. The problem is getting enough fat and protein, which means tofu, peanut butter, coconut oil, and avocado make up a huge part of my diet.

5449 2018-09-05 13:58:29 227 gallons heating oil, $573.
5450 2018-09-05 13:58:24 Beautiful! It looks like oil 
5451 2018-09-05 13:58:21 The stupidity came from big oil. Pressured Libs for short FN consultation. Captured the NEB, who then excluded maritime shipping. 

Couple of BIG mistakes by the oil industry there...

5458 2018-09-05 13:57:15 Shitload of avocado and coconut and food cooked in olive oil. Also I'm eating more tofu than I thought possible, but I have to if I want to get enough protein without drowning in eggs.
5459 2018-09-05 13:56:59 I mean that sounds great .... but you are only thinking of the worker not what happens to the business, costs, taxes, gas, oil.

5462 2018-09-05 13:56:41 you really are a backward,deluded brit, still banking on the oil wells 
5463 2018-09-05 13:56:38 Your reluctance to engage in an OBJECTIVE scientific discussion and muting speaks volumes.  No snake oil here, only FDA 510K cleared devices and know how in an EVIDENCE based platform w DOCUMENTED RESULTS < MTBI rates-faster recoveries. Watch your “snake oil” comments-counsel is.
5464 2018-09-05 13:56:35 This isn’t about politics. He’s a pathological liar, a snake oil salesman, a conspiracy theorist. And he’s the leader of the free world...I fear the worst is yet to come
5465 2018-09-05 13:56:31 well, that would also depend on the training wouldn't it? Social or clinical psychologist -- but either way people with various backgrds share stages to exchange info - no all high level thinking - kinda like a PM trashing the oil sands project with a pseudo scientist

5473 2018-09-05 13:55:50 Who I whip the baby oil out on then wtf
5474 2018-09-05 13:55:44 The longer we allow big oil and other dirty energy sources to destroy what we have left all for profit, we can't undo pollution economically. And Oil companies have a dirty history of pollute and abandon their wells uncapped or poorly capped that leak 24 hrs a day in the Gulf.

5496 2018-09-05 13:53:46 Well, That’s because of their Oil money 
5497 2018-09-05 13:53:40 As long as we keep ploughing the oil revenue in to WM to keep the UK afloat.
5498 2018-09-05 13:53:24 Having a hearty laugh at all the gung-ho types who think protecting corporate oil interests overseas has anything to do with freedom.
5499 2018-09-05 13:53:20 I do agree that without oil and byproducts it would of taken a lot longer for us to enjoy life today as we know of it. But we have all treated oil byproducts recklessly to our disadvantage, ruining our oceans, our fresh water resources, our rivers, lakes, our air quality.

5549 2018-09-05 13:47:56 Oil packs an energy density per cubic inch greater than anything for its cost which is why we use it. 

Work done is when a "force moves something over a distance"

Using oil, we have work done for us daily like having 20 employees per person in hours of labor done for us.
5550 2018-09-05 13:47:50 Or check out Greece, Zimbabwe, Italy to see what happens when government spends money it doesn’t have.  We are not Norway with publicly held oil reserves.  Need to balance spending and revenue.

5574 2018-09-05 13:44:37 What's even more funny about Jeff is he's using a parallel to what the Venezuelan government actually did to all the US/UK companies with oil operations there. He's a nut!
5575 2018-09-05 13:44:37 Governments leasing land & resources to corporations is the worst thing for the environment imaginable. Denuding of forests, depletion of fish/wildlife, & oil spills are due to lack of private ownership, not the cause of it. Change my mind.
5576 2018-09-05 13:44:34 I'm not sure about all that. To get to the point you're talking about, China needs to be a very dominant price-setter in *both gold and oil*. We seem very, very far from that.

5578 2018-09-05 13:44:20 And you haven't got me right yet. Your assumption on Thika road ignores natural growth. On Geothermal it ignores the counter productive rise in taxes and the fact that without geothermal, price will be double. On oil, ignores that not a single barrel has been exported.

I realise the differences between oil and gas construction etc but this  enquiry seems to be taking too long and I am suspicious as to why.
5619 2018-09-05 13:38:51 It also means that the PBOC can print CNY to move oil markets against CNY gold mkts.  And if PBOC can control CNY gold/oil ratio, PBOC can control USD gold/oil ratio.  And if PBOC can control USD gold/oil ratio, PBOC can ctrl USD....which means CNY can't have EM currency crisis.

5714 2018-09-05 13:29:10 I'm late to this thread but I fail to see why @anddelaparra is a troll for stating his view. Or is he not allowed to?? The electric car will not come of age until there are sufficient renewables to make the generation of electricity from oil or gas unnecessary
5715 2018-09-05 13:29:09 China is eff. offering phys gold to settle offshore CNH surpluses left at oil exporters.

5718 2018-09-05 13:28:52 Decades ago, in the back of some magazine, was an ad for a World War II M3 Stuart "Honey." It would come in crates, packed in crankcase oil. Assembly required. Something like $4,500. As a kid, I dreamed of getting one and building it in my backyard. I still dream of it.

5754 2018-09-05 13:25:37 Not  true.
I was a safety engineer employed  to work with design and construction engineers on new oil and gas facilities both onshore and offshore. Fire or explosion was our No 1. Risk?
My first question would be why was sub-standard  cladding installed in the first place.
5755 2018-09-05 13:25:33 Meanwhile in Russia, OFZ auction cancelled because of global volatility - or in other words "we didn't feel like selling into a buyer's market". Good thing they don't really need the money with oil near $80
5756 2018-09-05 13:25:31 One palm oil company has destroyed an area of forest half the size of Paris. 

PepsiCo, Mars, Nestle, Unilever - companies that have promised not to buy palm oil from forest destroyers - are all supporting the destruction.

5773 2018-09-05 13:23:39 Yes, around £47. But the energy usage ratios for what's used for heating/cooking etc. can be quite different. Many places are oil heated rather than electrically, so there's a separate utility bill for that.

It is merely symptomatic of a deeper underlying problem, and that is the fact that we run a Unitarist political-economy that is dependent on the oil fields of the Niger-Delta.

5841 2018-09-05 13:17:44 Rupee weakened by 0.3% against the US Dollar today. Weakness in Rupee is largely attributed to the excessive speculative demand that is causing volatility amid crisis in the emerging market currencies and consistent rise in oil prices is also adding to the pressure.

5965 2018-09-05 13:05:41 Very true, unfortunately. South-South leaders are cut from the same cloth of corruption, greed, incompetence & ignorance. They think oil revenues will last forever.  They are comfortable always blaming the FG for problems they can tackle locally while excusing their laziness.
5966 2018-09-05 13:05:31 LOL they let people sell cigarettes and they kill people. You think this snake oil works. Oh I forgot if you fall for what he says you will fall for anything. Like Sandy hook was staged and you voted for the POS in the WH. So yes I can believe you think it works.

5981 2018-09-05 13:03:51 a political system OWNED by the NRA? I don't think you know who actually owns the political system. The NRA is way down the list of donations to politicians. Their lobbying is a drop in the bucket compared to unions, big oil and even Planned Parenthood. You're a hypocrite
5982 2018-09-05 13:03:45 Happy days at #RBD and all that took the opportunity to top up. The Company intends to acquire further interests in low-risk, high-impact upstream oil and gas projects. The Company believes such projects offer compelling economics as commodity prices are robust and project values
5983 2018-09-05 13:03:44 How will he invest in the future if he cuts our major industry that has fueled Canada to this point? Without oil we don’t eat! Every tractor runs on diesel & will continue into the future... We have too many politicians with no real thought processing
5984 2018-09-05 13:03:31 I feel your pain. 9 has adhd and we've tried everything to get her to sleep. We currently do: story, lavender oil, quiet reading, sleep meditation/music. Sometimes it works. She gave up naps at 20 months  Do you have a blackout curtain? We find that helps on light evenings.
5985 2018-09-05 13:03:31 Have ever seen any innovation by Saudis or Arabs, except buying a foreign tech company with oil  money? Just check around yourself, then you will see nothing!
5986 2018-09-05 13:03:30 So. much. oil.
5987 2018-09-05 13:03:28 Helps get smooth and oil free skin: Beat one egg-white until stiff w/ lemon juice. Apply on your skin for 20 mins. Rinse w/ lukewarm water.
5988 2018-09-05 13:03:27 Plant it in a bigger pot and put it in a sunny spot. Then a cook a couple of chopped garlic cloves in olive oil, add 2 chopped tomatoes and 20 leaves off of your plant, let it simmer while you cook some angel hair pasta. Add the pasta to the tomato mixture, toss in parmesan, eat.

5991 2018-09-05 13:03:16 No comment on Chris Oil (I do not follow him) but AAOG now a bargain.

5993 2018-09-05 13:03:09 The last remaining oil leak on the Primera is a gasket on the oil cooler. A gasket I can't find on the parts system. Where is it?
5994 2018-09-05 13:03:07 Just checking to see if you can uncover those getting bribery funds from military corporations, NRA, big pharma or the oil industry.

Your corrupted government comes from those sectors. Other nations are simply piggybacking on that greed.

Expose the greed from death companies.

5996 2018-09-05 13:02:51 Radical thought, how about we depend on, ohhh randomly picks, CANADA? We could actually use our own resources, refine our own oil and become independent?
5997 2018-09-05 13:02:51 Helps get smooth and oil free skin: Beat one egg-white until stiff w/ lemon juice. Apply on your skin for 20 mins. Rinse w/ lukewarm water.
5998 2018-09-05 13:02:49 Yes, but it's American built, so the doors won't quite fit, the plastic will smell of oil and the gauges will be vague.
5999 2018-09-05 13:02:47 That's not how it worked- Trump undermined the global agreement and sabotaged public protections so friends and supporters in the coal, oil and gas industry could make more money, grooming political patrons w/ $. He increased pollution and demonstrated bad faith to our partners.
6000 2018-09-05 13:02:44 It isn't heart healthy if you use oil of any sort.
6001 2018-09-05 13:02:38 Sayur bening/sayur air isnt sup sayur. Sup normally kena tumiskan guna myk. But my husband's fam recipe (their nenek moyang are from tanah jawa) not need to use oil. Just didihkan air, masukkan hirisan bwg merah+putih, ikn bilis. Bila da mendidih, masukkan garam. Just to taste..

6005 2018-09-05 13:01:53 It’s quite nice as a dip if you swirl some olive oil, salt and pepper through it. @gisgigi taught me that.
6006 2018-09-05 13:01:33 The squeaky wheel gets the oil.

Time to go and annoy some people to get some stuff done.
6007 2018-09-05 13:01:33 "Most toddler drinks are primarily composed of powdered milk, corn syrup or other added sweeteners, and vegetable oil, and contain more sodium and less protein than cow's milk."

Sheesh. Just go get a Fribble. At least it'd be enjoyable.

6009 2018-09-05 13:01:27 He is a glorified snake oil salesman who like trannies. None of that stuff is regulated that why they are called supplements. I would like to see the scientific research on that stuff. LOL he has conned you 3 ways.

6018 2018-09-05 13:00:22 Ken Copeland has a mental issue that has never been addressed. I have watched and listened to his broadcasts redefining the true messages of Holy Scripture to his liking and his snake oil sales pitches for products. He is a disturbed individual centered on self, reflecting TRUMP

I had received communication fr @ICICIBank  that acquiring banks are not processing cashback from there end
6022 2018-09-05 13:00:01 This is just sad.  It seems to further the narrative that the left really does want to take away our 2nd Amendment rights.
6023 2018-09-05 12:59:43 Alta., Sask.,Man. must look to alternate routes to move oil! Churchill or northern pipelines! We can wait no longer for BC or The east to support Canadian interests! Equalization payments must cease,western market stagnation must end as quickly as possible! Our future is at risk!
6024 2018-09-05 12:59:43 Dear @RSPO tweets, I am outraged to hear that you continue to credit #palmoil villain, @Nestle & @PepsiCo’s business partner, @Indofood by certifying them. That’s not sustainable palm oil, suspend them now.
6025 2018-09-05 12:59:31 It may stop working.  But it won’t contaminate a coastline, ruin a lake, or incinerate a town.  The costs of the oil industry are offloaded to the environment and ordinary people.  No perfect energy source yet, but in terms of risk, this seems a cleaner model.

6028 2018-09-05 12:59:24 Apapa is a nightmare, you need to understand that businesses are shutting down daily due to the problem in Apapa and exporters are the most affected. It's not just oil tankers that have blocked the road, trucks carrying export 
Goods going to the port are also part of the problem

Just ask the Yemeni & the relatives of their dead
6031 2018-09-05 12:59:09 So apparently the oil marketers are refusing to replenish their stock coz rumour has it once Uhuru lands he will scrap the VAT. You can imagine holding stock which is VAT inclusive while other market players have VAT exempt. Kitaeleweka!

6040 2018-09-05 12:57:55 My mom made muffins without sugar, oil, etc to try and wow I think I've never had a muffin so dry, it's like we left it there for a week before eating it haha The taste is good tho, so I guess the recipe could use some improvement!
6041 2018-09-05 12:57:40 Why are we importing oil and exporting oil at the same time? Sounds like Gov at work.
6042 2018-09-05 12:57:38 Diplomacy does not always need to revolve around money. Sometimes morality trumps greed. Invading Iraq was for oil. Morally bankrupt. Defending Bosnians was the right thing to do in Europe's most recent civil war.

6057 2018-09-05 12:56:05 No, you are probably correct. And I am disgusted by it, actually. I am old school and believe you are truly not profitable until you are out of debt. I have stood on my own financial feet for 55 years; short of $100 plus oil, forever, the LTO industry can't. It will require help.

He will strip Colorado of jobs with our booming gas and oil industries. And his priority is the Front Range. There is more to Colorado than the Front Range.
6064 2018-09-05 12:55:32 @noida_authority @noidatraffic @sspnoida Padestrians are finding difficult to move near Indian oil bldg sector 1 due to police post built on footpath and heavy traffic in rush hours, which is prone to accident. Request to do needful so that people can walk comfortably.
6065 2018-09-05 12:55:26 It was for the Oil pipeline deal which Taliban refused to sign, but surprisingly after the war and the new leader was chosen by US, the pipeline deal was promptly signed off.

6069 2018-09-05 12:55:10 While the US gnashes its teeth over Russian interference in their elections, US grps provide up to $40M to CDN anti-pipeline grps & politicians to keep our oil ltd to domestic markets!

6085 2018-09-05 12:53:09 @1025_MD Mayo = egg yolks + oil. Nothing else. Add garlic to get aioli (yum!!!) Sour cream = cream + bacteria to sour it. They are not even closely related.
6086 2018-09-05 12:53:08 It’s hot oil. I almost burned my hand
6087 2018-09-05 12:53:07 Sure, the conservatives had their share of screws up on the file. That said, they were NEVER  as hostile to business like the CURRENT NDP, and throw in the salient fact of billions going to the rest of the country via transfer payments, and alas, we aren’t oil sheik rich.

6093 2018-09-05 12:52:45 I'm being told Saudi will do whatever they must to keep their biggest customer happy.  Once oil is settled in a 2nd currency, things get interesting in FX, rates, commodities, etc.
6094 2018-09-05 12:52:41 Yeah I loved their packaging. Very considerate  bread was squishy yet crispy on the exterior

My bet is that these days, all journalists everywhere have been threatened  with boiling in oil if they even admit to the existence of Common Purpose.

6105 2018-09-05 12:51:27 Tony, where's selling SA's strategic oil reserves?

With all the hullabaloo about petrol prices, I would have expected more State Capture questions about how our reserves were sold, to whom, at what price, & where the money went?

Sure would have come in handy now

PRT ICO produces small-capacity oil refining units to process black oil fuel and produce liquid fuel by using the transonic combustion technology.
6110 2018-09-05 12:51:07 Dude, oil is a 5 trillion bussines, fracking, oil spills , pipes, refinig, transporting ect. You either have no sense of scale or you deliberately trying to talk shit. Battrey production is insignificant compared to Oil.

6202 2018-09-05 12:40:58 35% of its grid. Not 35% of its energy. 

The electric grid is typically 25% of the total energy.

75% is gas, for industry, cooking and heating. Oil for cars, trucks, buses, ships, trains and planes. 

So 35% renewables is no more than 9% of the energy.

6273 2018-09-05 12:33:41 Goverment should've kept some funds aside from what they earned in those years of oil price prosperity, and later pump into system to maintain prices. But  all they have done is spendings on social schemes for pure political advantages at the cost of economy.

6351 2018-09-05 12:25:30 What do you expect? It’s low risk for the media industry and no one gets offended. The oil fields mean nothing to those huddled in urban areas and they can happily swallow any propaganda that is handed to them. They’re not confused with the facts.

6357 2018-09-05 12:24:53 Also last time I checked, oil companies are on the hook to clean up those spills. And typically once they complete the cleanup it's hard to tell there was even an occurrence. How have oil spills affected you personally?

6374 2018-09-05 12:23:21 So because there are negative incidents involving the transportation of oil, we should not use it? Unfortunately the alternatives (wind/solar) CANNOT keep up with modern demand. Nuclear is the only viable option to provide baseload power besides natgas/coal

6376 2018-09-05 12:23:04 I don't think you quite get it do you? Take the haggis if you want, I'd even give you half the oil - cause it would be more than worth it - just please fuck off and let us do it differently. We're sick of the UK's constant warring with the world.

6381 2018-09-05 12:22:53 PDP that made $381B oil revenue in 4 yrs and looted all to create this mess are not brain dead. D Past creates present.
6382 2018-09-05 12:22:48 What’s your idea of an appropriate place some corrupt bankers secret room or oil mogul’s living room wall? Maybe just maybe the corrupt government should have taken care of its crown jewel instead of lining their pockets
6383 2018-09-05 12:22:40 Buy the dip!!! And discover oil

6393 2018-09-05 12:21:38 I change the oil every 25-30 thousand miles, or when I think about it. It gets better mpg now than it did when I got it.

Still can't sleep. :/
6407 2018-09-05 12:20:31 I’m sorry mate but getting the ideal mix of olive oil and balsamic vinegar on your bread is a myth?
6408 2018-09-05 12:20:23 @marklevinshow I wonder how many dems burned the midnight oil reading some of the Kavanaugh documents that they didn't have a chance to read before the hearing. Probably, none of them

6416 2018-09-05 12:19:16 It’s...sickening.  Orrin’s from Utah.  They’ve probably never heard of garlic & olive oil, pepper & salt.  That’s what you use if you don’t have red sauce.  And for kids:  butter.
6417 2018-09-05 12:19:11 Hey @Aryanwarlord @Narayan24179712 @SAW21107 @YusufDFI  check out this genius. He can block Indian oil supply through port of Gwadar into the open ocean. 
6418 2018-09-05 12:19:10 今日は何オイルがいいかい?アロマオイルで香りたい?オリーブオイルでイタリアンたい?ふふふ…僕は君のためならどんなオイルにもなってやるさ…
6419 2018-09-05 12:19:04 Social media managers are snake oil merchants. I can't stand 'Social media influencers'  

Social media is meant to be social. So be that. Post honestly and positively and people will follow.
6420 2018-09-05 12:19:04 Bingo! And they are such a small amount of our Country! Most of us are normal humans, but we have big mouth squeaky wheels trying to get the oil! We need to shut their kind of crazy down! @charliekirk11  we’re done letting a few mess up USA! @POTUS 
6421 2018-09-05 12:18:47 Get our oil & balm for that extra push

6429 2018-09-05 12:17:28 Might as well change the oil while the vehicle is in the air!
6430 2018-09-05 12:17:26 SOEs can produce product. A fine example is the Norwegian State Run oil company which is behind the growth of the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund to $1 trillion currently.
Energy is a product so Eskom is not really a service industry.
6431 2018-09-05 12:17:03 my car won’t stop telling me i need an oil change like bitch i know i’m just broke

6435 2018-09-05 12:16:41 Had a Nurburgring one when I was younger. On an old, decrepit 320i that the guy at ring hotel forbid me to take on the circuit because it had dropped so much oil on his car park. So I bought a sticker and put it on. It went with the car and I will never do it again
6436 2018-09-05 12:16:38 Yes. Love both the honey and olive oil.

6444 2018-09-05 12:16:15 I regret to inform you that due to its reliance on oil production, its racism, and a recent breakup of mine, all discussions of scandinavia are forthwith banned
6445 2018-09-05 12:16:09 Together, we can save American lives, American jobs, or don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.
6446 2018-09-05 12:16:05 If the science says it, it probably is. Here's a clue - the dude selling snake oil might be a grifter. If you distrust 'MSM' don't just jump to believing the first fucking moron you come across on youtube.

6451 2018-09-05 12:15:45 This week's schadenfreude (OMG I did that without spell check!) for me is definitely the rise of Guyana's and the fall of Trinidad's oil sector. Guyana's imminent (this I spelt wrong) glow up after years of ill-treatment pleases me.

6455 2018-09-05 12:15:20 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil:for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointestb my head with oil; my cup runneth over.(Psalm 23:4-5 KJV)
6456 2018-09-05 12:15:16 @Cynthiastruth I wonder how many democrats on the judiciary committee burned the midnight oil last night reading the Kavsnaugh documents, so they can make an educated vote. My guess...none

6461 2018-09-05 12:14:25 "The phoniest and whitest things in the world cannot be fondled or even pursued - they must be washed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
6462 2018-09-05 12:14:16 @JeannieLee88  Jeannie, I know you are just reporting the facts. Buy oil at $69.70 at midnight on the Aug 3rd. Sell at approx. $72 at 7AM on on Aug 4th. Make $2.30 profit. This is ridiculous. What did these buyers/sellers do to merit this profit or improve society. Nothing!
6463 2018-09-05 12:14:10 So. Why did nobody tell me that the argan oil eco styler is the goat?
6464 2018-09-05 12:13:54 Big American Oil cartels collude and conpire with OPEC terrorist to raise the price of oil and gasoline for all of us.  Not @elonmusk

6472 2018-09-05 12:13:16 The #lithium "majors" have their hands full with their own & upcoming proj. This creates the need for new investors. Likely candidates - OEM's, battery / cathode manuf, or oil co's...or traditional mining co's. Issues faced by OEM's ~ $GM suggests they're most likely candidates
6473 2018-09-05 12:13:12 You said oil corps do not pay people to speak out against Tides etc.
That is totally untrue.
They do not pay YOU because you are a gullible fool but they do fund the likes of @friendsofscience 

You got caught in yet another lie. Sucker!
6474 2018-09-05 12:13:07 Are we only doing TCs or are their Twitter spouses too? Asking because I need my oil changed and the trash taken out

6480 2018-09-05 12:12:22 Do you have a source from the Canadian Government saying they will not purchase Saudi oil?
6481 2018-09-05 12:12:13 Terrorists will be in London very soon plus there is no Oil for your government to steal in Syria. Troll, you lost the fight already. Go and fight the Russians and see what happens.
6482 2018-09-05 12:12:09 I’ve started a serendipity painting with oil painting some times ago but it was harder than I thought and i didn’t finish it...
Should I finish it and post it there ?
6483 2018-09-05 12:11:34 Just drive by the rail siding beside Rothesay Avenue in Saint John New Brunswick and you will see several tracks filled with tanker cars from Alberta & I believe the Bakkens. People think because there is no pipeline that oil isn't being transported...they'd be wrong.
6484 2018-09-05 12:11:31 What resources? Oil?
There will always be corrupt governments all over the world, even if jezza crawls his way into Downing Street.
6485 2018-09-05 12:11:09 As long as we have lots of planes at home. Charity begins at home. With the billion dollar oil bailout Trudeau gave I don't think we can afford a major peace keeping role.

6506 2018-09-05 12:09:24 1. Capital outflow from EMs to guaranteed US (with raised rates)  2. Oil Revenue is Price * Volume. While Price is high for Nigeria Volume is low.  In summary 1. Capital outflow 2. Low Oil production to match the outflow
6507 2018-09-05 12:09:22 no, my mother is dead... they have no human rights over there, other than oil, which we can produce ourselves in my country, we do not do business anymore with them so they can kiss my a$$...
6508 2018-09-05 12:08:52 ビール追加したい。
6509 2018-09-05 12:08:47 You think companies being able to dump left over of coal in ditches is good?  You think setting you oil wells all over the coast is good? You think deleting of many years are climate data is good?
6510 2018-09-05 12:08:46 For 2 years now I've started my school day drinking "Bulletproof Coffee."  Coffee with butter (Kerrygold is best), coconut oil, heavy whipping cream, and Stevia.  Great stuff!
6511 2018-09-05 12:08:44 State is getting a good amount from each liter of oil sell. BJD is donating exchequer to poor.If it really hurt to poor, give a discount.
6512 2018-09-05 12:08:38 It’s easier to do in countries that have stringent labelling laws on processed food (+) but yeah if your country doesn’t it would be nearly impossible to avoid palm oil.
6513 2018-09-05 12:08:25 por cierto eeuu es el unico que paga oil de contado a vnzla, hahaha para que sigas creyendo en bloqueos, debes leer mas, no estas preparado

6518 2018-09-05 12:08:00 Did you see the long hair on those guys? They needed some serious hot oil treatments.

6523 2018-09-05 12:07:18 Like Kiyosaki said, there are good, bad and dumb debts.
These kinds of debt are dumb, and annoyingly they are foreign debts denominated in dollars and so we must pay back with oil receipts.
Also, parts of the funds are being stolen, and that is too painful for words.

6525 2018-09-05 12:06:51 Instead, this government chose to increase central excise taxes (by over 200% on petrol and over 400% on diesel) to make oil costlier than it has ever been, and collected over Rs 10 lakh crore by way of this cruel exercise in unjust enrichment.
6526 2018-09-05 12:06:38 Ladies what do we mix the Magnolia Tissue oil with to get rid of those stretch marks or dark marks??

6527 2018-09-05 12:06:28 'the winter of discontent'? Look in to reasons why economy was in such a state. Look in to role of Heath government; OPEC oil crisis; IMF... Look at history as it occurred not soundbites churned out by propagandists.
6528 2018-09-05 12:06:26 Since 2014, international oil prices have been at a historic low. Any other government, with the barest of concern for its people, would have passed on the benefit to the public
6529 2018-09-05 12:06:23 Let's not forget the fumes. You just know those idiot drivers aren't going to stop their motors and the staff will eventually stop enforcing it. Even with primo ventilation, one jalopy burning oil will ruin whatever greenery is on top.
6530 2018-09-05 12:06:19 Meanwhile, Varunga is being quietly sold off to mining (oil, global mob), so cousins nearby if not also in Rawanda will be slaughtered or at minimum, suffer more habitat loss.

6555 2018-09-05 12:03:28 Why fuel prices increase?  Commodities are sold in dollars in the global markets and we have to buy dollars first with N$ to get a barrel of oil which is used to refine biofuels like petrol, diesel etc.

6595 2018-09-05 11:57:07 First of all this 1.4 lakh crore is a bogus figure. The due in 2014 was $4 billion which is 25,200 crores. It was not paid to Iran because of US sanctions, not because Dr. MMS forgot to bring his wallet. US sanctions were lifted in 2016. 

Essar oil had a due of $2.5b with Iran.

6601 2018-09-05 11:56:44 Shell is probably a big oil company on the precipice of being something else. I would guess fair critics who understand both its successes and failures will have an influence on what that something else is, and unfair ones will not.
6602 2018-09-05 11:56:39 @PepsiCo @Nestle @Pizza Hut & @TacoBell spend millions on their ‘ethical’ image & say they only use RSPO-certified #palmoil. But truth is @RSPOtweets gives the OK to destructive palm oil by brand @Indofood #savetheorangutans
6603 2018-09-05 11:56:36 Hey bro you got any snake oil you can sell me please. I will pay anything
6604 2018-09-05 11:56:29 Though if you think about it, consumers have known about climate change for awhile, too, and our demand for fossil fuels has only expanded. And there's no mass movement begging politicians for a carbon tax (which oil companies mostly support).
6605 2018-09-05 11:56:23 Spend time and money with people who make me happy!! 
6606 2018-09-05 11:56:13 A lot of Shell shareholders don't want it to pivot to renewables at all, but it's doing it anyway. I think it's tempting to put all the climate blame on Big Oil, or just assume out of reflex everything out of their mouths is a cynical lie.

6611 2018-09-05 11:55:57 It's committed to being an energy company, not an oil company. That's why it's spending up to $2b yearly on "new energies" and tied CEO pay to emissions reductions. It's small but big bets on renewables in the past failed.

6615 2018-09-05 11:55:46 They have as well here (there is a ancient recipe with fish fried in olive oil, you wouldnt use lard, It seems it was il forno, or over a fire/bbq), the skew was towards lard or the dish itself produced the oil. e.g carbonara was w/guanciale dopo pancetta. Butter 4 cakes/biscuits

6659 2018-09-05 11:50:08 This is a pipleline that transports about 150,000 barrels per day. Working with an estimated oil price of $75 per day, the downtime has resulted to an estimated loss of about $1.01 billion in 3 months (June to August). This must have significantly impacted the foreign reserves.

6664 2018-09-05 11:49:43 It’s simple, the consultation process was flawed, rotten and a mascarade. The national energy board is controlled by the oil majors, it will always approve leaking pipelines anywhere. Thanks to the justice system that pipeline won’t leak.
6665 2018-09-05 11:49:42 (When rail cars carrying oil derail they can explode and kill people — a famous example is Lac Mégantic. Pipelines can leak, which is bad, but they don’t pose the same direct risk to human life)

However, if you want to know who is really behind events, you look at the highest in command, lead organizer.

6682 2018-09-05 11:47:50 That seems like a lot of oil, 75 drops total...
What size spray bottle would you recommend for that recipe?
6683 2018-09-05 11:47:39 Yikes, #palmoil regulator @RSPOtweets is greenwashing @Nestle & @PepsiCo’s business partner @Indofood. RT to tell the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil to punish Indofood for dealing in exploitation palm oil!
6684 2018-09-05 11:47:39 Capitalism is the cause of climate change. Oil companies have known that burning oil raises the CO2 level in the atmosphere heating up the planet. Drilling for more and burning more oil to make more money is more important to them than keeping the planet's temperature stable.
6685 2018-09-05 11:47:27 @WholeFoodsUK Hi there, I purchased a fish oil product at your store and when I opened the box, the bottle itself was not sealed and not quite full.  Can I return this?
6686 2018-09-05 11:47:22 That's great news, expensive oil will speed up development on green energies

6691 2018-09-05 11:47:07 Perhaps we need TV that links what people buy explicitly to wildlife impact & solutions e.g. Palm oil prod'n, 'bargain' solid oak furniture, soya products, beef etc. What about it @MartinHGames? Good business is looking at supply chains could it be done for the ave UK home.

6693 2018-09-05 11:47:04 Yes, and aren't these all pretty much places that we're fighting with, because of their extremist governments? Except for Saudi Arabia. They give us oil, so they're our friend.
6694 2018-09-05 11:46:49 The Saudis are not our allies. They are Gun runners with oil. Among our Allies, we are despised, because the orange Game Show host has made a fool of himself in front of the whole world. And now with his Russia kiss up summit, it will take a long time to get that respect back.
6695 2018-09-05 11:46:33 all those people who go to these holy, ghost, fire churches then get sold water and oil deserve mampara of the century and actually dont deserve to be South Africans

6698 2018-09-05 11:46:23 If you checked canada moves oil just fine what the problem is people dont want 3 new pipelines  And government is working to fix whatever problem that may rise from this .and Saudi Arabia tried to get us to get their oil but we stand strong over human rights issues

6702 2018-09-05 11:45:41 Manmohan Singh issued Oil Bonds to Oil Marketing Companies worth 1.4 lakh crore and kept prices artificially under control. It was left to Modi Sarkar to pay that bill including interest totalling to 2 lakh crore. Plus Iran had to be paid 3 billion dollars, another UPA handover.
6703 2018-09-05 11:45:38 That would be wonderful! I often listen to @SoundCloud recordings from @JackiDailyShow and believe she is doing a great job to educate people about the oil & gas industry.

6707 2018-09-05 11:45:01 More proof is Russia was allowed on EU oil pipeline straight to Germany, supposedly our great ally. Look at all that US did for Russia when she was secretary of state. Not to mention China had free access to Hillary's server and probably others.
6708 2018-09-05 11:44:56 Okay what type of highlighter oil (or whatever) are you using all over because your bod looks amazingly glowy and lit from within (or are you just that fabulous )

6710 2018-09-05 11:44:51 Because the oil was the factor that made all the differences. 

The chunk of it.

Had it been same price then, you were not looking at 190 figure.

Low oil prices and high trade deficit is something to write home about, when it comes to Modi's inefficiency.

6721 2018-09-05 11:43:50 This should actually translate to a steady growth in our foreign reserves. However, oil production in Nigeria has slowed down since May, following the downtime at the Nembe Creek Trunk Line due reported cases of theft along the piepline.
6722 2018-09-05 11:43:50 Modi Govt. had inherited Rs 1.4 lakh crore unpaid bills of the oil companies during 2009-14. It paid back with interest of 70000 Cr. @INCIndia won't tell you this.

6728 2018-09-05 11:42:55 It must break. Question is when? My target since 2015 is for 2018. Trump delayed it by having Saudi princes arrested in lieu of higher oil. Now Saudi/UAE are close to bankruptcy. Hopefully, within max of 12 months peg should break plus Saudi/UAE will start accepting Yuan for oil.

6739 2018-09-05 11:41:46 Problem - there’s peace and we need war to create jobs at home and occupy the public perception. Reaction create Islamic terrorism on our doorstep.

Why did they invest so much in Gwadar port? Oil and gas supply, easy to buy from middle east/Iran then supplied to China via road as compared to navigate around the whole Asia.

Why are the other ports in Nigeria besides the one in Apapa working when refrienery in Kaduna and (a new one is currently being built on Kastina)is working?

6761 2018-09-05 11:39:25 It's true that crude has been trading at decent levels for some time now. And I think the bulls will retain their grip in oil market in the coming months, given that the second round of the US sanctions on Iran will take effect in November.

6769 2018-09-05 11:38:22 The Right has been surprisingly slow to wake up to the threat, IMO, perhaps because they believed that a virtually unlimited supply of cheap, pliable labour would oil the wheels of big business.
6770 2018-09-05 11:37:50 Well, the argument from that perspective is that there isn’t enough existing pipeline capacity which means oil needs to be shipped by rail, which is more dangerous.

6795 2018-09-05 11:33:46 Yes but Canada doesn't have the infrastructure to move it's oil and can't even build a pipeline.  Also it would violate Canada's Paris Climate Accord agreement to increase production.  Making Canada permanently dependent on Saudi Arabia.

6799 2018-09-05 11:33:08 Companies saying one thing and doing the other sound familiar? Palm oil industry regulator @RSPOtweets claims to boost ‘ethical’ #palmoil ► The truth is it certifies exploitation palm oil company @Indofood, @Nestle and @PepsiCo’s business partner
6800 2018-09-05 11:32:46 So the plan is to stream on Friday and Saturday. Reason for this is I start raiding tonight on WoW and continues the next night. I'd be down to stream my progression but I want to make my first stream as Affiliate extra special. Been farming up oil like mad on Azur Lane.

After that retweet I am kind of having a melt down, and I'm trying my best to keep it contained. But my brain is sinking into oil right now.
6804 2018-09-05 11:32:17 Extremely Accurate.

To be fair, I did stop once one of my books became stained with garlic oil.
6805 2018-09-05 11:32:03 Spirituality is 1 with God. Your lost. In a maze trapped. Mixing beautiful things with evil. Good and evil dont mix like water and oil dont mix.

6807 2018-09-05 11:31:21 Simply offer a UK pension plus a 20% top up guarantee from "other region" revenue from tankers and licences which currently disappears into the GERS vortex. Put it on banners. SNP in an indy govt controlling oil gets you 20% above the UK pension. Job done.

6815 2018-09-05 11:30:53 Yes B/S is exactly what we thought as well. You're living the 'oil fund'. You can have whatever size of resource you like but it's only worth what you can sell it for at a profit, it's called a market. You'll need to pay off debt and remove deficit before any oil fund.
6816 2018-09-05 11:30:44 What does it smell like? Deadline sharks? Chain saw engine oil? Asking um.... for a friend
6817 2018-09-05 11:30:44 Be proud . . . I used to live in Oak Park, Illinois and we had protesters for 2 years against the Iraq war!  Some days only 3-4 people showed up - sometimes 30 - but it reminded people about our guys dying for an "oil war". To protest is a right - like voting!

America is more important to us than the S400, Russia, oil, Iran & wet dreams about what we'll do in Afghanistan. I think @potus tweets & unpredictability is queering the pitch. India must embrace the inevitable.

6840 2018-09-05 11:25:57 I think that's a good idea when trying to be consistent. You can really tune into it. Oil is a good instrument focus on also b/c it usually moves in a rather consistent manner, providing good opportunities without volatility changing too dramatically more than not.
6841 2018-09-05 11:25:46 Hes not wrong about yhe Liberals and CPC but he offers nothing in a solution to buying foriegn oil.
6842 2018-09-05 11:25:22 What r your prices on a gram of oil? Also how is the GG 4 for someone who is a very light smoker who is seeking something to combat their panic attacks & anxiety? They don't want to use crappy pills (benzo's)

Don't under-estimate him - he's a snake oil  salesman,  and cunning as a fox.   And shameless,  like Trump.
6846 2018-09-05 11:24:55 We may just revisit again in about 2 weeks and see how the tides change. The global stock market is in volatility.  Oil prices shot from $50 per barrel in 2016 to $83 per barrel nowadays.  There’s a lot of other factors sliding the inflation bar and it is not just TRAIN.
6847 2018-09-05 11:24:50 @RhodaGrant For you to say that the scots parliament was set up to mitigate your london government policies is rather distasteful and sums up why your voter base is dying along with your tawdy branch office. Keeping folk poor at the height of an oil boom for votes is despicable.

6929 2018-09-05 11:14:15 Absolutely the currency falling is a big part of their problem but why hasn’t the oil exporting countries like in the Middle East or Scandinavia have Venezuela’s level of dysfunction? Private property is what leads to the possibility of diverse economy.
6930 2018-09-05 11:14:13 the job oil marketers and transporters is to supply, we customers create the demand...we have not stopped buying....this is the point, the cost of living in Kenya is affected more by drought than market forces taxes included..

6932 2018-09-05 11:14:00 Facts of Life or Death? In my opinion the West has a lot to answer for invading countries and backing terrorists & terror Regimes all for oil & power in the Middle East. Talking always the better route than bombing!

6935 2018-09-05 11:13:45 Solution: Each property sale contract should have full disclosure on properties near or conjoining that may want to exercise their gas, oil, mineral, feedlot, flight pattern, irrigation ditches etc. rights. When buyer signs contract, they waive right to protest, sue. etc.

6942 2018-09-05 11:13:00 when the Government pushes the Paris agreement- curb pollution to fight climate change - then they are building pipelines and the PM is quoted as saying ' only a fool would leave the oil in the ground '  empty the oil sands as fast as possible -  you wonder how credible any are

6960 2018-09-05 11:09:57 People are getting what they asked for. Britain has a large reserve of standard oil. If it was used to power Britain would they need to frack at all. By the time those reserves were used, Green Energy would be affordable by all.

6970 2018-09-05 11:07:59 Crude oil prices: Oil prices fell on Wednesday. US WTI crude futures were at $69.34 per barrel at 0036 GMT, down 53 cents, or 0.8 percent, from their last settlement. Brent crude futures fell 34 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $77.83 a barrel.
6971 2018-09-05 11:07:58 Diversifying oil exports away from the US is a good thing.
6972 2018-09-05 11:07:48 i’ve run into the same thing. I think it’s because the vegetables get cooked in a lot of fat and oil, more so than would go into mashed potatoes. makes for fantastic roasted veg, but the heavy leaden mash

6975 2018-09-05 11:07:31 Looks good only on a loaded crude oil tanker. Imagine passing through this on a chemical tanker in ballast. I did it several times across Atlantic and trust me the word ‘wow’ was never used..

7057 2018-09-05 10:56:42 Most likely it's fine if eaten with decent food, like most fat. If part of junk foods - then probs will occur but not from the coconut oil.

7063 2018-09-05 10:55:07 Today, I am calling on the government to turn it's back on Alberta and destroying as many jobs as possible and importing more oil into the country.  Singh should resign.  He and the NDP are no friends of Alberta workers.

7065 2018-09-05 10:54:46 What Tullow Oil is transporting to Mombasa is stale oil and some officials related to NOCK MD is making a kill from transporting this stale oil.

Me: Stay well hydrated, get 5-8 hours of sleep, exercise at least 3 times a week, drink (insert herbal tea) this, have you tried (insert essential oil) yet? Do you meditate? Etc 
7067 2018-09-05 10:54:28 The PTI supporters who will continue to use natural gas for cooking after the price hike will still insist that its too early to criticize PTI. Those considering to switch from gas to wood/oil might not agree. #Tabdeeli

7070 2018-09-05 10:53:35 And we had an international EXPERT coordinating our economy at that point in time....Still trying to imagine what went wrong between 2010-2014 that we had record high crude oil sales...
Did we have people we could call CAPABLE hands with international exposure? YES

7071 2018-09-05 10:53:33 Coconut is my favorite.  Using palm oil is the equivalent of clubbing baby harbor seals.   Avoid it.
7072 2018-09-05 10:53:11 @realDonaldTrump won’t mind India buying Russian missiles , he has natural affection for Russia and its interests since it was responsible for his election. India buying oil from Iran , he won’t mind that either
7073 2018-09-05 10:52:56 Yikes, #palmoil regulator @RSPOtweets is greenwashing @Nestle & @PepsiCo’s business partner @Indofood. RT to tell the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil to punish Indofood for dealing in exploitation palm oil!

7086 2018-09-05 10:50:43 I showed the OPEC figures from oil revenues since 1990. In four years from 2010 to 2014, the PDP government earned the highest oil revenues in Nigeria’s history, USD381.9billion. By contrast, the Buhari Administration has earned USD121 billion from May 2015 to June 2018, less

7191 2018-09-05 10:37:09 Hey genius, please enlighten me why Syrians are pouring back into Syria since SAA secured the country? You need to start thinking for yourself. Syria & Russia could allow the US to take these rebels back to USA? That should make you happy... Syrian oil belongs to Syria!!!
7192 2018-09-05 10:37:06 Did you ever hear about unequal ecological exchange? Of course, we stole and steal the natural resources of the world. Did the oligarchs make the gold and the oil? Who does it belong to? What is the 'right' price? See the work of Alf Hornborg.
7193 2018-09-05 10:37:05 ...system cause it to idle a little funny. You can test this by undoing the oil filler with the engine running - it'll get noticably rougher idle. I had the engine in my E36 so I know a little if you had specific questions 
7194 2018-09-05 10:37:04 #palmoil company @Indofood exploits workers. I want @RSPOtweets to kick the rogue company - and @Nestle & @PepsiCo’s business partner - off its certification scheme & stop supporting exploitation palm oil now! #workersrights
7195 2018-09-05 10:36:51 Well I’m guessing I’m older than you are. Wrong we were the ‘poor man of Europe’. We actually had coal, North Sea oil and made things. We didn’t have the internet, mobile phones or JiT trade. Read Saving Britain by @Andrew_Adonis and @williamnhutton you might learn something!
7196 2018-09-05 10:36:33 @PepsiCo @Nestle @Pizza Hut & @TacoBell spend millions on their ‘ethical’ image & say they only use RSPO-certified #palmoil. But truth is @RSPOtweets gives the OK to destructive palm oil by brand @Indofood #savetheorangutans
7197 2018-09-05 10:36:25 Jason Gableman in Cowen’s Oil & Water Monthly: #OPEC export data into November could be volatile as producers adjust to Iran sanction impacts. Continues to expect OPEC to offset at least the low end of estimated sanctions-related supply disruptions #oil
7198 2018-09-05 10:36:04 うんうん、家も通信費をどうやって削るかが課題だよ。
削れる物は削って、プランも見直したけど、これ以上は削りよう無いらしい。もう格安スマホとかしか無いのだろうか？面倒でキャリア変えたく無いんだよねぇ。
7199 2018-09-05 10:36:04 See? Major oil companies pulled out and left SA operations to management buyouts. Think Mobil.
If you want to debate ,up your game on the issue.
7200 2018-09-05 10:35:58 More so how source are left which would be able to supply the rest of the need electrical requirement not hydro produce source cause of environmental concerns so what's left coal, natural gas & oil source quiet problem we have how to produce the electrical power we need

7220 2018-09-05 10:32:52 As ever, America goes all crazy. Consumes it in excess (I mean who has a spoon of pure coconut oil every morning?!) and then next comes research about the poor health effects. 

Everything in moderation folks.

7231 2018-09-05 10:30:55 also oil trade with iran can stabilize rupee as payments r made in home currency/gold..tht will weaken petro $ too...why depend on u.s dirty oil & strengthen weaponized Dollar

7240 2018-09-05 10:29:55 ....but I'm not advocating for a system that has been implemented in the past

And again, Venezuela isn't an argument against socialism that is a very insane situation mostly focused on weird monetary policy and overreliance on oil wealth

7246 2018-09-05 10:29:08 Data isn't oil. It can be valuable but it isn't a transient resource and unlike oil we can make more of it at will and with limited costs. If we approach data with a prospecting frame of mind we will completely miss the point of it.
7247 2018-09-05 10:28:57 Dear @RSPO tweets, I am outraged to hear that you continue to credit #palmoil villain, @Nestle & @PepsiCo’s business partner, @Indofood by certifying them. That’s not sustainable palm oil, suspend them now.

7296 2018-09-05 10:20:05 Duterte's economic managers think imported rice, meat and fish will solve the inflation problem. Those imported goods will make the high inflation higher. With currency depreciation and high oil price, those goods won't be cheap. They're bought in dollars and delivered using oil.

7462 2018-09-05 09:52:53 You mentioned crude oil prices as a reason for trade deficit being at $190 Billions in 2012-13 but you didn't mention rate of US dollar at that time which was far less compared to now. Crude oil prices and it's purchases is in US dollars, not INR.

7502 2018-09-05 09:46:24 You're not business minded then? We haven't got oil tycoon owners and need revenue. Although I don't agree with the u21 squads, it's a revenue path. It's costs money to open the stadium and rather than spitting your dummy out at the fa, Support your club when they need it.
7503 2018-09-05 09:46:06 Key thing is @narendramodi govt has completely failed in spurring growth and revenue from other sectors, so falling back on earnings from high fuel prices. Plus, it's open secret that @BJP4India govt is coercing oil PSUs to bankroll its political campaign.
7504 2018-09-05 09:46:05 Modi Govt. had inherited Rs 1.30 lakh crore unpaid bills of the oil companies during 2009-14. It paid back with interest. Congress won't tell you this.

7512 2018-09-05 09:45:12 Britain imports crude oil from Nigeria, and exports refined petrol and diesel to Nigeria.

7529 2018-09-05 09:41:51 Makes perfect sense to me! Iran exports its crude oil to UAE and Saudi and it's exporting more and more as the middle east crude oil reserves are diminishing. @georgegalloway do you think its all about the oil.

7531 2018-09-05 09:41:14 I think 10 years ago the US needed Canada for oil with an unstable middle East.  Now the US is the 1/2 largest producer and Canada can't even build a pipeline.  The US has no imports from Canada that are not easy substituted.  Trade deal with Canadian barrier's is pointless.

In fact I use SO MUCH vegetable oil in my fry-ups that it's probably at least TWO of my five a day!


7593 2018-09-05 09:31:14 Girly you have to try fish oil. My skin is much softer and more balanced out since taking them. I think they've also helped with mild acne, but that could be other things. Try them!!
7594 2018-09-05 09:31:03 kahapon first time ko natikman ang 555 spanish sardines ang sarap gusto ko talaga sya (pero yung oil jeske haha)

7602 2018-09-05 09:29:25 for pores boleh buat exfoliate sbb i buat chemical exfoliate my pores dah okay. also lepas make up make sure buang make up and buat double cleansing. which is first pakai oil cleanser dulu such as biore, simple ,hada labo. but im using simple then facial cleanser. donee

7605 2018-09-05 09:28:23 Agree to the fact that petrol/Diesel price is really disturbing. But if you see this in other way, this is the only way Govt can take money from rich and tax evaders, So they should actually think of abolishing or reducing the income tax and increase the tax on oil

7614 2018-09-05 09:26:00 However if you change the oil on your car more often than having a basic blood test then you probably have your priorities wrong. A GP doesn’t need to get involved, you can have this test at a pharmacy (which I do every year).

7618 2018-09-05 09:25:47 @realDonaldTrump An institution, or a bank, should not trade with Iran, and Iran's oil exports should reach zero by November, and there should not be any exemptions, yes it is true that the superpower of the United States will completely cut off Iranian oil exports by November.
7619 2018-09-05 09:25:39 If their oil is that much, and oil is very expensive, why the 25Tri debt?
7620 2018-09-05 09:25:19 `bbcnews Are electric bikes restricted so as to protect the oil industry.E.g. pedal powered bikes are permitted to travel faster than e_bikes which are limited to 20mph and power is limited INSTEAD of having speed limiters fitted.Yet again the uk fails to fight global warming!
7621 2018-09-05 09:25:18 @realDonaldTrump All sanctions must be fully implemented without any exemptions, in particular sanctions on oil and petrochemicals. Some banks that violated the sanctions have been penalized, we welcome this decision.
7622 2018-09-05 09:25:08 On a 'Point of Principle'!
As opposed to having ulterior motives for entering/not entering conflicts! Gulf (Oil) War etc. Or being aware we have reduced our country's forces to vulnerable levels thro cutbacks + ignoring such Foreign agents killing people here in UK!
?Principles?
7623 2018-09-05 09:24:45 Nest step is a fabricated scandal involving forged documents.

If there's any risk, it must show strong benefits local, not just rape & pillage! I guess it's a no for me!

7681 2018-09-05 09:12:12 I understand all this. I'm simply stating that to many (some of who I know) they thought leave meant simply leave. They have held that view for a long time. Long before the snake oil guys got involved. The undermining of the EU has been a long term project.

7718 2018-09-05 09:08:09 That’s all very fair. The issue Remainers have is that the EU is not actually to blame for a lot of that. The problems this country faces are due to the failure of successive governments, immigration was here long before the EU & chaos in the Middle East Bush/Blair oil wars

7728 2018-09-05 09:05:43 The lye reacts with the oil to make soap. There's nothing else in it, just an alkali and an oil. Superfatting (adding excess oil) ensures all the alkali is reacted, resulting in a more moisturising soap.

7738 2018-09-05 09:04:22 any way ya want to twist it, the lawyer is correct, because laws are made by government, for government, regardless if the law is justifiable or not. Thats also why a SINGLE APPOINTED judge can effectively close Alberta oil pipeline.  ZERO SENSE. EVEN LESS ACCOUNTABILITY.
7739 2018-09-05 09:04:12 Petrol prices too high. Don’t know why state taxes are not capped. It’s almost like the states make more money when crude oil goes higher. Shouldn’t it be the opposite?
Instead of cursing centre, we must pressurise states to reduce taxes on petrol and congress must take a lead.

7829 2018-09-05 08:48:16 Yes, VAT increase may be having some Impact. Yet, food inflation, for example,  has been at around 3% since May, even after the  VAT increase. Transport inflation seem to be the major driver, on the back of high oil prices and volatile ZAR-USD X-rate, of course.

7858 2018-09-05 08:44:07 Lots of people who don't have a clue about Venezuelan history like to tell us all it's an example of failed socialism.

Venezuela is a whole lot more complex than that reductive sound-bite. It's much more a story about rampant corruption, over-reliance on oil and poor vs. rich.

7863 2018-09-05 08:41:40 No permanent friends...just permanent interests. For example we have good relations with both Iran and Israel, while thay keep threatening war with each other. Iran supplies us oil for cheap and Israel gives us access to latest tech. Same can be applied to US & Russia.

7873 2018-09-05 08:40:16 Facial Scrub for Dry Skin

-1/4 cup uncooked oats
-1/8 cup honey
-1/8 cup olive oil

Oats, honey and olive oil make this a little different spin from the honey and oatmeal facial scrub. But it’s incredibly simple and great for skin that is aching for moisture.

7893 2018-09-05 08:37:50 Not quite. Britain renounced the Mandate because it was too difficult to manage. Attlee and Bevin opposed a Jewish state because it would jeopardize UK oil interests and abstained on the partition vote at the UN.

7903 2018-09-05 08:35:59 For sure the market will refocus on Peak Oil. The question is when and from what price. If this is going to be years away it is not a help to anyone. Specially when electric vehicles start sapping the demand for oil.

But undr UPA, oil was at its lowest price, then how did #ChorCongress increase oil price from rs48 to rs81 in 4 years??

7960 2018-09-05 08:28:38 Yeah all other cases, delays, proceedings, trials should be criticised just because of the audacity of the CJP to call "honey" as alcohol and how dare he suggests that a whiskey decanter will have alcohol in it! It was olive oil!!!
7961 2018-09-05 08:28:19 I am sure he is not so corrupt as Fazlur Rehman, who is a firm follower of Islam and steals diesel. Remember when crude oil prices go up then the prices of basic necessities increase too, as oil being one of the basic raw material for production.

7995 2018-09-05 08:23:13 Britain imports crude oil from Nigeria, and exports refined petrol and diesel to Nigeria. France imports sugarcane from Nigeria, and exports sugarcubes to them mostly in the form of St Louis Sugar. Switzerland imports cocoa from Cote d'Ivoire & Ghana, & exports chocolate to them.
7996 2018-09-05 08:22:52 Lots of my pals round here work on the oil refinery or linked to it. I fancy something like that as it pays well and is a career. Going to see someone at the council who deals with veterans and employment, might as well make the most of the vet bit. Employers like us apparently!
7997 2018-09-05 08:22:45 Can I have a jar of snake oil please.
7998 2018-09-05 08:22:42 While back I copped a $1319 bill for a new speed sensor. Still didn’t work. Turned out oil leak was causing it which was fixed by a bit of silicon sealant. 6 weeks pay for nothing, Jako 
7999 2018-09-05 08:22:25 So did China actually begin to trade Iran oil in Yuan? Or is it still a threat? I’m thinking wag the dog with North Korea is a threat to @Southkorea_agen if they release disruptive technology in electric vehicle 750 km range 20 minute recharge. #petroldollar

8004 2018-09-05 08:21:30 As per the 5th of September 2018, the Oil Archetype Index does not indicate a BUY signal for the oil price.
8005 2018-09-05 08:21:26 See balance sheets of oil cos, all in public
8006 2018-09-05 08:21:25 This strapped all oil cos of cash, forcing them to borrow and get into a debt trap,, they borrowed in foreign currency for lower rates, exposing them to forex risk, all max during 2008 to 2012,when INR nosedived from 40 odd to 60 odd
8007 2018-09-05 08:21:22 We are still bogged down by seeing 'diversity' in tribal, cognitive or biological terms. Our primary global asset is not gold, oil, or ‘data’, but a collective readiness to cultivate a ‘diversity-of-diversities’. This is a serious starting point for a viable post-carbon economy.
8008 2018-09-05 08:21:15 5. Don't put lemonade bottles in the cupboard so when you open it they fall out and  potentially cause shin injury

8013 2018-09-05 08:20:17 Yes, I know, and now I see you are a science denier. Super! The whole thing is a mess. Oil over endangered species. An hour off shipping time over the life of a sentient creature.  Have you people never heard of shipping lanes? Electricity?

Time for an election, me thinks.

8022 2018-09-05 08:17:56 Yes, this is one of the totally tragic features of climate change. It will be the poor that is worst hit. Oil is a dirty thing and generates lots of money. The changes ahead will grow and show and we are all in the know.

The fries are mushy because they’re absorbing the oil, starch will absorb the oils and give it that crunchy exterior.

8127 2018-09-05 08:00:22 Yes, mining is a filthy game and Chinese health and safety is appalling. It doesn't have to be that way - look at the improvements made in coal mining and oil production in the West. Btw, do you have a source of the 70% figure?
8128 2018-09-05 07:59:43 Old people not realizing that selfies are way less vain than having oil paintings made of themselves... I didn't have to commission anyone and I got way more likes.

8158 2018-09-05 07:53:59 Well he mentioned IGR in Lagos during Tinubu tenure; and about oil revenue $75 is better than what we use to have and even with that is the government owing contractors or workers or has projects stopped?
8159 2018-09-05 07:53:43 There was no probable cause for the arrest and was released on $0 bail w/ no travel restrictions.Most of what you see on twitter/media is fake news. Everyone needs to do their fucking research before believing this shit.Tension between China and US are high and theyre adding oil
8160 2018-09-05 07:53:42 RBI can't do anything to check the price of dollar against rupees like our govt. who fails on every count to check the oil prices.
8161 2018-09-05 07:53:28 During UPA price control resided with govt. All the more they subsidised rates . All that amt used to go to oil companies. Subsidies were paid from tax payer pockets.
Yet the prices were high.

2day scenario is different. show complete perspective rather than being prejudiced.

8163 2018-09-05 07:53:05 I used coconut oil .. gallons of it !! A few nights a week: shampoo hair and use comb to take out the flakes .. also she is 
8164 2018-09-05 07:53:04 No wonder you no longer work in oil exploration since you think 0.5% global production that generate just over 3 bil in revenue for Syria, pre-war, is  a consideration a global conspiracy to waste money & time on.

Guess that explains why Russia is taking all the oil now right?

8166 2018-09-05 07:52:53 Here's my favourite recipe: Liver "sleeps" overnight in olive oil, red wine, herbs (oregano, peppermint, ground bay leaves, cinnamon, red paprika powder, parsley), sea salt, garlic, lemon zest/juice. Tomorrow I grill it in a grilling pan and serve with goat butter ;)
8167 2018-09-05 07:52:50 Even grants are  debts. There are conditions tied to them. Once you borrow against an unsustainable cash flow, we are doomed!  Let's just imagine A sharp drop in the price of oil to a base price of $20 per barrel.
8168 2018-09-05 07:52:50 Crude oil in 2013- $108.76 a barrel. 
Petrol price in India- Rs 69.73 a litre

Crude oil in 2018- $78.12 a barrel 
Petrol- Rs 86.25 per litre, highest ever. 
 Kept fuel prices low despite high global prices. Will this arrogant Modi govt think about the people of India?

8186 2018-09-05 07:50:09 We kill Middle Easterners to control fossil fuel resources there so we can burn all the oil & kill the world instead of building solar, wind, & geothermal energy here at home. That is the insanity of capitalism. I hate being part of this, but I know I am & I wanna stop somehow.
8187 2018-09-05 07:49:59 The Vitamin E oil made my breakouts even worse. It didn't help whatsoever. That's what I meant in my previous reply

8192 2018-09-05 07:49:25 She just wants to destroy Trump's Presidency before the first term is done. No chemical weapons have been shown to come from Syria...If any fell they came from rebels....They want Assad out for oil and money even if it costs American lives ...as usual.

8238 2018-09-05 07:41:03 The end of field life is due to economics. A field gets decommissioned when the value of the oil produced no longer covers the cost of production.  

Would you propose operating these field in public ownership at a loss? What would be the point?

8298 2018-09-05 07:30:42 Mind my words Venu, the Oil deals are fast underway. US is eyeing all of Venezuela's Oil, where India is eyeing Iran's.

The implication is that oil price shocks should  have little impact on Ghana.However,the oil price fall in 2015 led to the request for an IMF facility,and a cut to the capital budget by an estimated 52.4%
8320 2018-09-05 07:26:26 Modi govt is simply cheating the people. Despite a fall in the price of crude oil in the international market, the fuel prices were going up in the country.

8326 2018-09-05 07:25:51 If the Leader submits extra info surely it is sullying it. If he hadn't tried to do this things would have been able to move on. Instead he has poured oil on troubled waters!

8329 2018-09-05 07:25:20 Try this: Rub extra-virgin olive oil or a combination of olive oil and honey a few times daily until it heals.
Also add a pinch of turmeric powder to olive oil and apply it 2/3 x's//day for a few days. It's rich in antibacterial/ anti-inflammatory properties & relieves itching.

8417 2018-09-05 07:12:22 Silent Sardar had created oil pool deficit of 200000 crores.  This govt can  also do that if they want to play real politics. They can easily reduce excise since we have ample Forex and moreover why care about fiscal deficit.  Let we have situation like Pakistan.

8426 2018-09-05 07:11:35 UPA govt was know for its based marketing politics.. Oil prices were mostly under control because they used bank debt money, public tax funds to pay oil bills and bear "losses"

Neither BJP nor UPA ever dared to touch taxes levied on fuel.. Reduction in taxes is likely under Modi

8449 2018-09-05 07:08:52 Even the US still borrow to shore up thier deficit,why didn't we stop borrowing when oil price was over $100 for number of years and by the way when did oil price rise to $70 that you expect the proceed will be enough to meet our demand.
8450 2018-09-05 07:08:32 But this is the problem with snake oil salesmen such as yourself. You bluff and offer up stupid narratives nonchalantly and naive people with even less proper understanding than you ignorantly believe you. That's why we're in such a mess as a country.

8506 2018-09-05 06:58:43 Congress took loans through oil bonds to the tune of Rs 1.44 lakh crore. This amount along with an interest of Rs 70,000 crore was paid by the Modi government. This is again an example of how Congress ruins while BJP repairs yet all the abuse is hurled at the BJP.
8507 2018-09-05 06:58:36 Modiji and BJP leaders  you will be definitely looser in 2019 due to wrong policy. You are overthrow SC ruling in SC/ST Act, you are fail to control oil price and collect huge tax from it ,indirectly destroy life of common people, playing castism fr vote. BJP will be looser.

8631 2018-09-05 06:33:06 The "pipeline" that you speak of is to ship raw tar oil sludge and toxic dilbit directly to China who owns the tar, not clean natural gas that may supplement renewables and benefit Canadians. Nice try. #cdnpoli

8633 2018-09-05 06:32:40 Sorry but oil is still needed to manufacture plastics, polymers & a ton of other stuff. Plus everything the moves machinery needs lubricants. It's going to be around for a long long time.

8652 2018-09-05 06:29:28 Canadian tar sands?! Firstly Canada employs one of the most destructive firm of oil production imaginable. Secondly, all oil producers are providing the feedstock of the plastic industry. Trudeau has even nationalised the piplines to facilitate.

8671 2018-09-05 06:26:45 I mean, any kind of oily substance works for that purpose. Coconut oil for example if we are sticking with food, or regular tool grease and motor oil. Granted, those last ones are kinda rough on skin.

8675 2018-09-05 06:26:28 I agree that social programs are opposed to free market/privatisation but they're still useful. But they sometimes go too far like Obamacare.

I think Socialist policy is Govt. trying to gain access to means of production - as Venezuela did with oil.
8676 2018-09-05 06:26:03 Some other states of the federation, let's not forget that the FG led by this doctorate degree holder had started borrowing to pay salaries despite the oil boom then; I'm not an economist but we know a govt that's borrow to finance recurrent expenses is already in trouble

“For example, under the system agreed yesterday, airlines burning kerosene could be rewarded with reduced obligations to buy carbon offsets because the refinery producing the oil was running on renewable electricity.”

& ‘offset’ is denial

8720 2018-09-05 06:18:40 High fuel prices should be a strategic decision.  Will help keep demand in check n encourage shift to public transport and in time to electric vehicles.

Global supply of oil may not increase n over time will come down.

India should have a clear target to reduce consumption.

Does the court case force the stop of all pipeline work or can some construction continue, sans oil? Helluva rollercoaster, stress and frustration for workers.

8811 2018-09-05 06:04:10 What happened is oil prices dipped and the house of cards came crumbling down.
8812 2018-09-05 06:04:02 Until then oil will remain the quickest easiest biggest bang for a given amount of effort. Unless partical physicists come up with something. Wind and solar isnt gonna cut it at our current growth rate.

8891 2018-09-05 05:46:52 Yeah when oil was 150-200 dollars a barrel.  Then it dropped to 40.  You can't fund a socialist government, AND fund a corrupt government that's looting all the wealth on a single export economy when that export suddenly drops 75% in value.

8895 2018-09-05 05:45:45 Bhaji in UPA govt crude oil was on 120 to 130 dollar per barrel and indian currency was also very low but they maintained the system.but this govt they just looting nd fooling the common man.look at the center govt tax on petrol nd diesel i think they r charging about 40₹..
8896 2018-09-05 05:45:40 Is any among you sick?Let him call for the elders of the assembly,and let them pray over him,anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord,and the prayer of faith will heal him who is sick,and the Lord will raise him up.If he has committed sins,he will be forgiven.

8941 2018-09-05 05:39:51 That is largely because the economy there is heavily dependent on oil and oil prices have been historically low. Civil disorder is pretty common when the economy is not doing well, this isn’t really unique to hereditary governments, this has happened across the Middle East

8978 2018-09-05 05:35:47 Oil is finite and global oil production plateaued years ago. In the near future demand will rise yet production will not only decline but start to decline rapidly and there won't be anything we can do about it. Civilization's dependence on cheap accessible oil is critical.

9020 2018-09-05 05:29:20 It will be tough for #Paris to cough up that money, though needed for these solders who guard the theft of oil revenues, Uranium & ++ minerals  from #CAR by #French Oligarchs. #IMF is playing with fire if it gives US #taxpayers $$ again to one of these #French neocolonial regimes

9022 2018-09-05 05:29:16 If the neocon warmongers continue getting their way, and we end up in this long-threatened War with Iran, the resulting spike in oil prices will push BILLIONS of people to move to solar/wind/tidal power.
9023 2018-09-05 05:29:00 Put a little black Jamaican castor oil on it daily and they will grow back faster
9024 2018-09-05 05:28:58 GDP 10.2 tha aur fir bhi udhar lekar govt chal rahi thi..Oil Bonds ka payment ho nahi raha tha.Oil companies were all in loss Wah. Udhar lekar mauj kar rahe they sab.

9026 2018-09-05 05:28:26 Should I feed obd2 from our car info into our home automation? I could turn my lights red when I need an oil change... but then my lights would be red.
9027 2018-09-05 05:28:08 "At this point, I'll just lay my hands on you and you go back to your seats with faith"
That's what those with nothing get from the oil
9028 2018-09-05 05:28:02 え。何ですかこれ(☆∀☆)

9030 2018-09-05 05:27:45 Modi Govt. had inherited Rs 1.4 lakh crore unpaid bills of the oil companies during 2009-14. It paid back with interest of 70000 Cr. @INCIndia won't tell you this.
9031 2018-09-05 05:27:43 Pan fry fish & chicken. Rarely a stir fry.  Use extra virgin olive oil far more. As I said, I never knew it represented a danger.

9034 2018-09-05 05:26:59 But it’s not frying if it’s not being cooked in oil. That’s the very definition of frying. Sounds like an air toaster..
9035 2018-09-05 05:26:27 Australia needs to seriously consider Nuclear energy.
France went to near 100% Nuclear energy for electricity in the 1970's after the oil shock and did it in 11 years. Billions of tons of black stuff not burned over the last 40 years...

とても親切に話聞いて頂けて大満足です
9037 2018-09-05 05:26:22 But Sir, time has come to do something different for few months as elections are looming. Common people don't care and understand this. Something must afffect them directly like reducing oil price. Remeber, there is no politics without power.
9038 2018-09-05 05:26:17 Ok, sure. Alternatives would be any of the forementioned oils in this image - such as ghee/butter and also extra virg olive oil for shallow fry up to 200c (the av. temp for shallow stir fry)
9039 2018-09-05 05:26:16 Meanwhile, those with little to give do not get the oil on their head and all they get is "God bless you"
9040 2018-09-05 05:26:14 I changed oil & filters at Walmart..  meh..
9041 2018-09-05 05:25:35 I need an all body massage

9042 2018-09-05 05:25:12 Wat about indian oil deal with iran??
9043 2018-09-05 05:24:59 4 years ago NPA was 2.4 lakh crores Now in 2018 NPA is 10 lakh crores!

4 years ago petrol 71.4 when crude oil at $105 per barrel. Now 80+ when crude is $78

Demonitisation that crushed the economy and ruined SME sector.

Helping loot and Scoot, Mallya, Modi, Choksi.
Rafale scam!

9046 2018-09-05 05:24:55 should tell us where cartels are selling Turkana Oil instead of underwear

9050 2018-09-05 05:23:59 When deregulation means cutting workers rights, removing environmental protection and removing the oil industries obligation to report donations to foreign governments, I don't see it as a strength. But why do you care? You got a tax cut and is dead in 20years so not your problem
9051 2018-09-05 05:23:45 a wee drops of machine oil?
9052 2018-09-05 05:23:38 but you are now anti mining and oil & gas to the detriment of SA-why ?? how sad
9053 2018-09-05 05:23:25 kinda lame but lavender essential oil behind my ears and on my wrists and 10 minutes of meditating/focuses breathing works well
9054 2018-09-05 05:23:14 She’s moisture’s Jamaican Black Castor oil is definitely a good one
9055 2018-09-05 05:23:12 Congress took loans through oil bonds to the tune of Rs 1.44 lakh crore. This amount along with an interest of Rs 70,000 crore was paid by the Modi government. This is again an example of how Congress ruins while BJP repairs yet all the abuse is hurled at the BJP.
9056 2018-09-05 05:23:08 I think you can if it looks like it needs it. Many recipes automatically oil the wood (like pesto), so it’s only if it appears in need, I’d say.
9057 2018-09-05 05:23:07 David, why is EV Olive Oil on the caution list? I can see to be wary of cheaper versions etc but overall use is cautioned?
9058 2018-09-05 05:23:03 Better roads will push vehicle sales. There will be more import of crude oil and air pollution. These are challenges, Nitin Gadkari @dipakdashTOI
9059 2018-09-05 05:23:01 Is it clear to everyone that France is financing the violence? It's a matter of oil and human trafficking.
Very sad that Libyans cannot walk peacefully towards democratic elections, their autonomous destiny...

9061 2018-09-05 05:22:39 Steak fries are straight garbage, not worth the oil they're fried in
9062 2018-09-05 05:22:32 The real play, for oil, is Argentina. The OPs guy, is competent, if the Finance wizards come up with the Money, the track record of Operations is why and how they got Gov't of Argentina to let them do a deal. Warren Levy is President, Argentinean Operations. #Cruzsur
9063 2018-09-05 05:22:28 He probably wish he made the goal to 700+ since he found his oil baron
9064 2018-09-05 05:21:54 Now i beli skincare dh tengok ingredients haha. Dulu main bedal yang ada mineral oil mmg sis tak pandang terus i buat cleansing oil yg biore tu just utk wipe makeup mata aje
9065 2018-09-05 05:21:50 Hey Pete, what draws you to using Canola? Less $? Its not a good oil - the money saved with grocery will eventually be tripled with healthcare costs.
9066 2018-09-05 05:21:49 CHANGE THE OIL YOURSELF THEY SAID.
9067 2018-09-05 05:21:47 Hey Kuntmala, you better burn the midnight oil and start reading!
9068 2018-09-05 05:21:34 Aye (again, downstream choice matters because of where you get upstream oil from, no?). Good they are going to get more revenue. They can use it to fix their flood prone state. I used to donate. No more. I can just stop my tourist ringgit to said state, can’t control everything
9069 2018-09-05 05:21:34 So i need to take my body apart piece by piece and individually massage each one. Oil my joints, wax my eyeballs.
9070 2018-09-05 05:21:33 Looks good! Try bashing rosemary leaves (six inch sprig), 1 big garlic clove, kosher salt (1/2 tsp), cracked pepper, olive oil (2 tbsp), 1 Knorr beef stock cube in a mortar and pestle into a paste. Rub it down all sides and sear. Suggestion only. Looks like you know how to cook.
9071 2018-09-05 05:21:30 I cook a lot and the dropping things into water/oil thing still scares me too! If you can, I'd strongly suggest getting tongs to do that
9072 2018-09-05 05:20:59 Everybody in the world pays the same price for oil so, its not the oil price thats the problem, its the weak Rand and you dont need to be a rocket scientist to see why
9073 2018-09-05 05:20:57 I def need to look into the oil. I have other cbds for chronic pain. Tbh I smoked a couple bowls and accepted reality lol. I haven’t been prescribed any meds yet but thanks for that info and for responding to my random tweet
9074 2018-09-05 05:20:51 Can you control international oil price.

9086 2018-09-05 05:19:14 Saudis have oil storage in Japan. They use it as a means of getting oil quickly to the market when needed. Just because they build it in China does not mean they will take part in the contract. They don’t hedge or do anything with WTI, Brent or Dubai now because they are too big
9087 2018-09-05 05:19:00 I beg to differ sir.  By issuing oil bonds mm singh just postponed the problem which eventually fell into Modi's lap  when discussing high fuel prices this should also be remembered

9090 2018-09-05 05:18:45 Half of you truly hate dark skinned women because you’ve been socialised to see our bodies as less than. We’re not “aesthetic” unless we’re half naked and dripping baby oil. It’s pathetic

9127 2018-09-05 05:13:08 Crude oil prices are going higher #86TooMuch . Why didn't central & state govt merging the crude oil to GST. I think it should be done initially, somehow it wasn't done but it should be done as sooner as Modi regime could do .

9136 2018-09-05 05:12:11 It will vary depending on the product. Do you mean honey or oil specifically?

9138 2018-09-05 05:11:35 At least @BJP4India should tell us this. They are failing in proper messaging. Meanwhile Congress with Left ecosystem are spreading half truths to properly benefit from oil and rupee crisis.

9146 2018-09-05 05:10:19 Sir why Govt not telling same to Public on various media forum. They shd bring white paper on Oil Economy else public assuming that these all are election time aligation.
9147 2018-09-05 05:10:17 The reason why Venezuela’s economy is shit is because the country is overdependent on oil. And after oil prices fell it went to shit. Uruguay has literally the same economic system as Venezuela and it’s not going shit for them
9148 2018-09-05 05:09:35 Dear @narendramodi , either you resign or ask @arunjaitley to resign - we can’t put up with this petrol diesel burden and fraud inflicted on us when crude oil was at lowest, we didn’t get any respite then . Rupee dollar is big ticket item. We are the sufferers, not cabinet.
9149 2018-09-05 05:09:26 So isn’t that what the cyclists are doing? They are observing the road conditions? They are avoiding the pothole, the manhole cover, the oil on the roads.
9150 2018-09-05 05:09:15 Some died for oil prices, thousands died because the government was scared to say they couldn’t win Vietnam. Not sure about Iraq resoning, but after we “won” thousands died fighting terrorist in the failed state we formed. Nobody disrespects the Military like the US government.
9151 2018-09-05 05:09:10 Who paid during UPA regime.. How come they could control petrol price...When crude oil price was hovering around 140$. How come suddenly it has become unmanageable.. Disel  price is lifeline of any economy... It affect 90percent of population.. Bring petrol ND Disel under GST.

9155 2018-09-05 05:08:24 Congress took loans through oil bonds to the tune of Rs 1.44 lakh crore. This amount along with an interest of Rs 70,000 crore was paid by the Modi government. This is again an example of how Congress ruins while BJP repairs yet all the abuse is hurled at the BJP.
9156 2018-09-05 05:08:16 Most of these emergency physicians in Nigeria work in the oil and gas industry. Ideally this case should have been handled by an emergency medicine specialist, thus it was the right thing to search the internet on how to improvise

We worked our asses off and burnt the midnight oil and finally made it to NIT Rourkela so we can enjoy blackouts and power cuts as proud NITians. Totally worth the effort.

Now that Indian citizens are reeling under high fuel prices,
9231 2018-09-05 04:56:16 In the oil fields there is a sense of reflection. After action reviews, improvement plans, ..etc so those years are made to count as you improve the next year taking in lessons learned from previous jobs

9246 2018-09-05 04:54:24 Some African countries r nearby. They produce a lot of crude oil. Our refineries r  designed to refine only overseas crude. So we have no way to mitigate the effects of fuel hikes.

9254 2018-09-05 04:52:51 The same people were so vocal against the rising oil prices and now they wanted the people understand why there has been a steep rise in prices of crude oil. Opposition must oppose what ever is the ground reality
9255 2018-09-05 04:52:44 The Rupee rose in early trade tracking recovery in Asian currencies led by the Chinese Yuan, while global crude oil prices also came off highs. However, emerging market currencies like the Argentinean peso, South African rand and Turkish lira continued to remain under pressure.

9376 2018-09-05 04:31:14 definitely do not use extra virgin for cooking, but light olive oil is better than canola with a higher smoke point. I started using it with my cast iron and it imparts better flavor with no apparent ill effects.

9386 2018-09-05 04:28:54 2+2 is important but India must point out its priorities. India imports 83% of energy out of which 25%comes from Iran. Few Indian refineries use Iranian oil. S-400 anti-aircraft missiles are important for our defence.

The over-reliance of high oil prices was the reason for the economic downfall in the first place

9475 2018-09-05 04:18:51 No, because actions taken on ground would justify the outrage. 
1) BJP has diversified oil portfolio  by signing agreements with US, &other countries, and it has invested in bio-fuels big time
2) Swamy just tweeted that the rising dollar is due to fleeing Participatory Notes.

9539 2018-09-05 04:09:13 further D profit with high taxes wud be equating with loss suffered by less  and diverted sale to other sates. The curbs on maximum limit of importing oil from other states are minimal effective.And officials get bribes for not showing the right picture to governments.GST =MUST!
9540 2018-09-05 04:09:10 I am agnostic to man-made global warming, don't think we should "go it alone" in emissions reduction but I suggest we should not be using coal, oil and gas which have finite resources. Higher power prices are ok - with means-tested rebates.  Think of it as small increase in GST
9541 2018-09-05 04:09:02 Sure, let's do the math.
The bulk of the new supply being shipped will be dilbit. 
New barrels of oil that can be refined in BC is 0. Scarcity remains, and the tolls go up. What do you have? Higher prices and/or slimmer profit margins. Most likely just the former.

What we are witnessing now is #Zuma's chickens coming home to roost. Little that @CyrilRamaphosa could do is 6 months to turn the oil tanker that is an economy.

9563 2018-09-05 04:05:35 I can't even begin to tell you the weirdness that is my current apartment. Oil smells, smoke smells, random cooking smells, none of it ours, some of it days old from our neighbours because the temperature changed in the basement. It's like a haunted house of smells here.
9564 2018-09-05 04:05:29 Yeah.  The auto red eye thing makes people look creepy. Like the oil eyeball thing in XFiles. (Tremors).

9571 2018-09-05 04:05:03 Extra Virgin olive oil has a low smoke point and if you try to cook with it, it will burn and everything will taste bad (and also burned oil is extremely unhealthy).

9575 2018-09-05 04:04:25 Environmental consulting (in Alberta) is big, especially if you have soils, plant or ecology skills. But wildlife too. And there are good jobs.
It's also volatile and subject to swings, depending on the price of oil (environment is the first thing they cut from budgets).
9576 2018-09-05 04:03:46 Write any first draft knowing you will toss it. But it must be written before the better draft can emerge. Like drilling for oil—you have to release the garage before the good stuff can be free to flow.

9579 2018-09-05 04:03:41 The idea is to create chaos. Thereby maintaining the need. If they helped restore peace in the region, the reason to be there would go away. No more military profit. And they couldn't justify keeping the military bases close to all that oil.

9628 2018-09-05 03:57:39 Now, if it holds true what you are assuming,  that would mean All Bands will need to be consulted for oil and gas activities in NEBC. .... Hmmmm. .... so benifit agreements in place now would be null and void until All Bands in Treaty 8 are consulted?

9679 2018-09-05 03:49:14 I presume most of their oil goes to Petronas? But I haven’t found a good answer as to where the oil goes to. (I personally only fuel up at Petron or Shell)
9680 2018-09-05 03:49:06 1. Say you don't mind inflation as long as there is growth.
2. Lay the blame on previous admin; mention dependence on oil.
3. Reassure that we're still on track.
4. Don't mention widening budget deficit.
9681 2018-09-05 03:49:05 I need to chug 23 grams of olive oil to get perfect macros for the day. Why is being this pretty so hard?
9682 2018-09-05 03:48:53 Quoting Newt is like drinking motor oil.  It’s not a very good idea!
9683 2018-09-05 03:48:44 Do you get the vapours often? Have you heard of CBD oil? It may be the only way for you to cope with 8 years of Ford. He’ll show you how it’s done.
9684 2018-09-05 03:48:25 Or line your pockets with oil money!
TRAITOR!

9730 2018-09-05 03:41:07 Time to oil yourself up and start streaming again
9731 2018-09-05 03:40:54 It's high time central govt does something on the rising petrol prices although rupee is falling down with dollars and rise of crude oil prices. Paying over 80rs for a litre of petrol is way too much. #86TooMuch
9732 2018-09-05 03:40:51 Ikr. Those can't be the two little girls he brutally murdered and stuffed in oil barrels could it?
9733 2018-09-05 03:40:51 I put coconut oil on my legs just so I can triple crossed  them #creavtiveartist over here  #almondjoyflow........

9735 2018-09-05 03:40:43 The Green party and environmentalists in general are vocal about supporting indigenous rights as long as it aligns with their agenda. Have you ever heard them support the right of any aboriginal groups actively involved in the oil sands industry?

9740 2018-09-05 03:40:19 Yesterday I threw a bunch of spices in some olive oil to sit overnight for a marinade.  
Used it on chicken today and it was delicious but I no longer remember what spices I put in it.
I will either A) solve this mystery or B) drive myself insane trying to.  (Likely B)

9743 2018-09-05 03:40:00 Nope I'd rather have Manitoba,Saskatchewan & Alberta for our own Country. Churchill would be the best option to get our oil to market. The meme just illustrates we r landlocked & if Trump decides he doesn't want our oil anymore we r screwed.
9744 2018-09-05 03:39:53 California can make those plans & transition so long as they extort cheap electricity & oil out of Canada. Go figure. Keeps their inflation rates low & gas prices so they can each buy a Hemi Hellcat or 1500 pickup. Muscle cars for everyone!  Yay!
9745 2018-09-05 03:39:44 Which floral oil do you vibe with the most?
9746 2018-09-05 03:39:43 Oil me bhi reservation chaie
9747 2018-09-05 03:39:37 The price of oil is muddied by speculators and current events. A better measure of industry health is demand, and it's up 2Mmbpd already this year. We also hit the 100 Mmbpd consumption milestone, almost a year ahead of predictions. Rumors of oil's demise are greatly exaggerated.
9748 2018-09-05 03:39:27 @Robert_Brescia I wish @JackiDailyShow  and @EnergzdEconomy  were sitting on the stage @wagnernoel_pac  and you were moderating - hopefully soon!  The recording on @SoundCloud teaches listeners in each syllable about global oil history!  This one goes into our favorite top ten!

9754 2018-09-05 03:39:12 Done with humans. More butthurt about a flag than oppression of other humans.   Ask your grandfather what he fought for. What are we fighting for now? Oil? Money? Terrorism?
9755 2018-09-05 03:39:10 Now, the reverse course had been charted, and there should be overall growth, with the business and personal tax cuts and deregulation to spur economic investment and creation of even more jobs. Promoting American steel, aluminum, oil, gas and coal have an overall effect.

9760 2018-09-05 03:38:16 I don't doubt that ... But the burning issue is ... Why are oil prices sky high? And will INR stabilize ever? Or is it going to score a century? 
Fin Ministry never have a clue and petroleum ministry I suppose is busy digging holes to locate oil

9764 2018-09-05 03:37:51 Yes. Oil dependent tayo eh. Plus not discounting the fact that some businesses are profiteering from this. 

Mas mahirap to para sa mahihirap. But sadly, govt cant just give more and more subsidies while taxing at the same time.
9765 2018-09-05 03:37:37 The steep hike in the prices of fuel will have a cascading effect on the common people.The govt should have subsidized the sale of fuel and let not the general public  bear the brunt of the all time high of fuel prices.The Modi govt should bail out the oil industries.
9766 2018-09-05 03:37:28 Crude oil was 77 ish on 23rd aug and climbing to 79 plus per barrel as of yesterday.
9767 2018-09-05 03:37:27 It turns out that the "Do Not Fill Above" line on my essential oil diffuser is not really too serious

and that's how i ended up eating dish soap tonight
9820 2018-09-05 03:30:11 How does olive oil lose its virginity 
9821 2018-09-05 03:30:05 5.   Proverbs 5:3.  For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil:
9822 2018-09-05 03:29:55 @realevanross my pops met your mom in Vegas when she was just starting to break out. He rubbed suntan oil on her. Lol yes my pops a flirt
9823 2018-09-05 03:29:38 Gee ... I wonder how much the Nike stock holders believe??? ...
9824 2018-09-05 03:29:37 Tip: Dishwasher rinse aid- fill container with white vinegar & 3 drops of organic lemon essential oil.
9825 2018-09-05 03:29:26 Basil is tasty but testy.  I figure it's cheaper to buy a plant, use it up, repeat as needed.  You can chop it finely and freeze it in olive oil, I do that most years.
9826 2018-09-05 03:29:16 Dear Kenyans,
Remember when we were told "investments" in geothermal would bring down electricity bills? Or that Thika "Superhighway" would end traffic jams? Or, as Kimani Ichung'wa asserts, crude oil exports would drop the cost of imported fuel? How did that work out for you?

9828 2018-09-05 03:29:04 I wonder what that would do for our dollar. They pay for oil in yuan, we pay for Chinese goods in $CDN, or yuan? Would it matter?
9829 2018-09-05 03:28:55 Absorbent material surrounds the boat, like a ring... since the oil was on top of the water, it keeps the oil from going beyond the boom and also soaks up oil due to its absorbent material.

9831 2018-09-05 03:28:16 Putting the fingers together like that is “a natural resting position” if you have carpal tunnel or other joint injuries. It’s taught in physical therapy. If I was someone notable or cared, I might stop doing it. But it relieves the pain and I don’t care, so I guess I’m a nazi.
9832 2018-09-05 03:28:12 Drowning is a type of suffocating. 

I bet you can't swim in coconut oil, because, being mostly water, you'd sink to the bottom. 
9833 2018-09-05 03:27:49 You can get the pen at the gas station. It’s the brand ooze it’s $20 and the THC oil I’m not sure. any plug might have them
9834 2018-09-05 03:27:48 Add a little perfume to oil to flavor your cigarettes
9835 2018-09-05 03:27:39 How many hockey league convenors, admin, coaches, and/or evaluators are still up burning the midnight oil tonight? #askingforafriend #buyyourconvenoracoffee
9836 2018-09-05 03:27:37 The thing about coconut oil is that the taste is too strong.  It dominates.  I hear ghee is like butter so should work better...
9837 2018-09-05 03:27:34 เพิ่งเจอคนใกล้ตัวกี้ดแมคเคนด้วย กี้ดดดด
9838 2018-09-05 03:27:34 Please qualify 'a minority of oil & gas CEO's' or 'some CEO's of large oil & gas companies' or even 'the gang of four' if you prefer more colorful. As you imply it was not an industry association position though some companies did support it.
9839 2018-09-05 03:27:23 take ur makeup off with coconut oil, face mask once a week, wash your face frequently (less ingredients that you cant even read=less harsh on your face), drink hella water, eliminate unnecessary stress
9840 2018-09-05 03:27:21 Y I haven't heard nothing more about Jamaica's oil?
9841 2018-09-05 03:27:06 Tea tree oil is one thing I wish I had tried sooner I was just a lazy bitch.
9842 2018-09-05 03:27:02 I'm the queen of googling natural home remedies lol. Just took an oatmeal bath to soothe my itchy eczema. Lathered myself down with coconut oil and now I'm ready for bed. Not sure if it's a placebo effect, but I feel less itchy already!
9843 2018-09-05 03:26:43 後ろ向きに全力前進DA！！！！！！
9844 2018-09-05 03:26:07 I screwed up by not steeping any herbs or garlic in the olive oil first. So next time, gonna try some Rosemary, dried chili and garlic in it's skin.
9845 2018-09-05 03:25:57 coconut oil has been my best friend lately

9848 2018-09-05 03:25:33 I love working out & I’m actually headed that way too. Hope it gets you the help you need 
Also if you are feel anxious on the meds, or in general, they work pretty well with CBD oil.
9849 2018-09-05 03:25:25 Would Quebec give two hoots was n hell about the oil issues in the west? No, so I don’t give two hoots in hell about their industries

9855 2018-09-05 03:24:41 Your periodic reminder that at almost $70/bbl the price of oil today (WTI) is some 7X HIGHER than when Hugo Chavez took power in #Venezuela. Yet, strangely, poverty today is also higher. So conventional wisdom that #Vzla collapse is due to oil price fall is, in a word, misplaced.
9856 2018-09-05 03:24:15 Would you have chips or fries without the oil that came from another crop, like maybe High Oleic soy, corn oil, sun, canola to cook them in?  Lots of crops have multiple food uses or contribute to the food chain is all I was trying to point out.  Food chain is complex.
9857 2018-09-05 03:24:00 @lucybeecoconut can you please remove reference of coconut oil from your Twitter name? @Harvard has just declared it poison.

9866 2018-09-05 03:22:24 Yes & No.

Yes:  Because Oil Lobbyists are the only group to surpass the NRA in their control over politicians.

No:  Because w/ renewal energy being on the rise, I don't get why politicians are still too afraid to balk at big Oil.

9885 2018-09-05 03:20:27 It was the sum total of the manufacturing and energy cutbacks. His war on coal and gas and oil production hurt the energy sector and, regardless of what you say, Obama stated most of those wouldn't come back (after the recession) because of his policies. Some did come back...

9899 2018-09-05 03:18:45 Moreover the big inflation of the 70s was not due to the Fed, it immediately followed Nixon abrogating Bretton Woods & the dollar's last link to gold. Foreign banks dumped dollars, Saudis tripled oil. Sowell should know better.

9974 2018-09-05 03:09:14 Alberta is still producing and exporting oil profitably, last time I checked. This sky is falling routine is based in greed and sounds positively childish. The resource is still there, the rush to exploit it reeks of an acknowledgment that the age of oil is almost over.
