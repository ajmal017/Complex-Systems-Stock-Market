1 2018-01-31 23:59:52 Remember Puty wants to sell his oil. Country broke cause like here (our #TaxScamBill) they stole it all the money and distributed to buds. 

He’s heading into elections and wants to toss trinkets to the crowd.  He really wants to cash in on his oil.  The sanctions piss
2 2018-01-31 23:59:43 Can you be essential if you’re not an oil ? 
3 2018-01-31 23:59:33 Have you forgotten people are still there? We'll see what history has to say because America's record with clean drinking water and oil pipelines have never been good. America's pipelines especially those that involve oil are more then 50 years old and are known to rupture/spill.
4 2018-01-31 23:59:06 Whoa! You done messed those up. Use butter instead of oil. That will change things dramatically. Looks like not enough flour as well.
5 2018-01-31 23:58:56 Oil give it a go
6 2018-01-31 23:58:54 Finally scheduled an oil change while i was sitting at the car wash today then realized they wash your car when you get the oil changed  #adultingfail

8 2018-01-31 23:58:40 my favorite hair oil leaked all over my locker 
9 2018-01-31 23:58:40 Just buying the oil and manually adding it in, it may be a little time consuming but I feel it's worth it and you can select the amount
10 2018-01-31 23:58:19 Sliding to your dms like a pickle soaked in olive oil
11 2018-01-31 23:58:11 Retired 7 months ago. ANYONE....ANYONE ( !!!!!) that depreciates the JOB a wife does in the house EVERYDAY has to be delusional!! OMG!! My oil field job of 35 years was a vacation compared to this.

16 2018-01-31 23:57:11 Your # one donor has always been Gas, Oil and Mining Companies you want to open public lands to drilling/mining. You are a fox watching the hen house.
17 2018-01-31 23:57:08 Today I learned a bunch of awesome Wild West slang for whiskey. For example;

- Kansas Sheep Dip
- Neck Oil
- Jack of Diamonds
- Nose Paint
- Pair of Overalls (two drinks)
- Pop Skull
- Prairie Dew
- Scamper Juice

Neat.

40 2018-01-31 23:56:56 @andy_matuschak have you ever made a flavored salt by soaking some fleur/etc in an infused oil? i thought i had seen this somewhere, but can't find it in any book i own
41 2018-01-31 23:56:55 LOL my dad is irritated bc whenever I go to get an oil change, I always get other stuff replaced when he could do it himself for cheaper... Whoops...
42 2018-01-31 23:56:51 My truck takes a lot of oil bro. Sheesh. Full synthetic at that.
43 2018-01-31 23:56:49 6 years old - just use it up! Nothing beats good old "Oil of Vitriol" and mine was 18M!!!!
44 2018-01-31 23:56:47 You're right, just a wrong footed start. No love lost... but just think... all the coconut oil handjobs we could have shared. Dah well. Next time maybe
45 2018-01-31 23:56:44 Show me your stuffed chicken and make sure it has some juicy olive oil.
46 2018-01-31 23:56:31 Thoughts on implementing a naval blockade to prevent the kind of ship-to-ship transfers of oil/goods that have been observed?

Seems like a more focused increase of pressure that puts NK in more of a bind than a 'bloody nose attack' (which has already been spoiled by pre-talk).
47 2018-01-31 23:56:26 It's the bloody palm oil. They kill orangutans & destroy their homes to get that nasty stuff.
48 2018-01-31 23:56:26  No thats my favorite oil

64 2018-01-31 23:55:32 Politics being paid to keep Canadian oil out of market
65 2018-01-31 23:55:18 Just saw a cooking video where someone referred olive oil as "pan lotion" lmao idk why but that's fuckin awesome I wish I thought of that
66 2018-01-31 23:55:16 Third, unless a club has an oil rich baron, who can play around with money more often than he does with his dick, then the fact is clubs will run like a business. Even Abrahmovic was unwilling to fork out for VVD as confirmed by Conte.
67 2018-01-31 23:55:13 Actually the Muslims did attack Russia's border Oil Fields.  Russians thought they would have millions of Muslims invading them and choose to attack Afganisistan.  All because of your precious DemocRats.
68 2018-01-31 23:54:47 Damn shorty I jus needed a oil change
69 2018-01-31 23:54:43 Van city gas prices highest in N.A. "But a combination of oil prices moving up several dollars a barrel, shortages in the U.S. West Coast where we draw in a lot of our gasoline supply ... all of these things are contributing to the much higher prices," McTeague said.
70 2018-01-31 23:54:42 When the revolution started there weren't jihadists,they came when Assad released Aq militants from jails in exchange of deals who aren't still clear,since January 2013 he even finance Is by buying its oil,he gave priority to the fight vs Fsa,shia jihadists have kept him in power
71 2018-01-31 23:54:30 Let me see...that's where the oil is. Must be a coincidence.
72 2018-01-31 23:54:26 since i’ve quit Thornhill I haven’t been back. well tomorrow i have to get my oil changed. i’m dreading it. i hate that place and everyone there 
73 2018-01-31 23:54:24 someone leave a gram of oil under my door mat please
74 2018-01-31 23:54:15 Researching it further, I'm worried that it's a recipe for distress; hemp oil's low smoke-point recommends it for warming, but not frying at high heat. But scrambled eggs taste better when cooked slowly - so maybe… Rice bran oil works *very* well, though.
75 2018-01-31 23:54:14 Allow me to install an oil refinery.  Oil is organic and the CO2 emitted won’t hurt her or her neighbors.

80 2018-01-31 23:53:18 So chimichurri hummus is just olive oil and garlic hummus with parsley and cilantro… so not crazy.
81 2018-01-31 23:53:10 : What do you get when you mix holy water with castor oil?A: A religious movement. #crackmeup
82 2018-01-31 23:53:02 You deep fry the skin in oil?
83 2018-01-31 23:52:54 n i even feel like not using moisturizer sometimes cos it does all the job, but u still should use it to keep the oil locked. i kinda went off sowwy 
84 2018-01-31 23:52:50 35+ years ago, working in IT, was asked to recover data on a *floppy disk* (!) by a major oil company's receptionist- turned out it included the firm's 10 year strategy paper including competition analysis, etc - THE works!!  and yes, they do collude...
85 2018-01-31 23:52:48 Trying all the things. Heat pad, YL cypress oil, ginger tea and more.
86 2018-01-31 23:52:36 Ok so you’re not gonna believe me but... sudocrem. I take my make up off with coconut oil, make sure it’s super washed off (not too oily) then towel dry face and then I put sudocrem on problem areas (spots/dry skin) and it’s incredible!!! #skincare
87 2018-01-31 23:52:10 In a sense, yes. There is a ‘blowback’ against globalization and the PC that perhaps comes with it. By ‘PC’ I mean the ‘respect’ we should show our fellow people from wherever. Trouble is, big oil and big military make profits from war and mass murder. We can’t have it both ways.
88 2018-01-31 23:52:03 ใกล้วันล้ะม่ะะะะะ
89 2018-01-31 23:51:49 Idk if I should spend more & go to dealership or just go with jiffy lube for my oil change..
90 2018-01-31 23:51:45 あおさの味噌汁美味しい！
91 2018-01-31 23:51:43 Thank you sir! Can I slide in your DM?
92 2018-01-31 23:51:28 To add to this thread, I feel like those shampoos and conditioner labeled with tea tree oil don't really have organic tea tree oil
93 2018-01-31 23:51:26 Tea tree oil is spicy. Idk how else to describe it
94 2018-01-31 23:51:22 Make my own coffee scrub. Whatever coffee you buy at the store, mix with grapeseed oil (or oil of choice), brown and white sugar. Very moisturizing especially in winter. Also can use for other parts of the body.
95 2018-01-31 23:51:19 Tea tree oil in my eye again, 100% going blind
96 2018-01-31 23:51:18 Will bring trucks and suvs to U.S. - shift small cars to China/Mex.  Oil spikes and it will destroy U.S. Auto Industry like 70's and 80's - people flocked to fuel efficient cars.  Short sighted strategy.  Chrysler falls into same trap as 70's - many their cars are guzzlers.
97 2018-01-31 23:51:16 Everyone agrees that it is safer to pipe oil than it is to ship it by rail. Than why on earth would we cancel the energy east pipeline?
98 2018-01-31 23:51:13 See whose talking about investments and big signings
Oil money changed chelshit..Chelsea be your childhood club ?? NO.

20-6

Mind the gap
99 2018-01-31 23:51:13 Many people from BC are absolute hypocrites! Willing to use oil and gas, and all their many by-products. All for pipelines if they carry oil or gas from within BC’s. Eg. the LNG terminal was supposed, because the gas was from within BC’s borders. Again, ABSOLUTE HYPOCRITES RIGHT?
100 2018-01-31 23:51:07 Ugh yeah.. lotta oil money
101 2018-01-31 23:51:03 for combo n oil skin types it's best the light type of oils, there's a lot but right now i can only think of rosehip n grapeseed oil shsjjdjs. i use grapeseed n i swear on everything it change my skin, im not as shiny anymore
102 2018-01-31 23:50:51 Oil towards USD 70 bbl #2018
103 2018-01-31 23:50:49 The new preoccupations track has amazing midnight oil tones and I'm having a fucking ball on it
104 2018-01-31 23:50:45 Condition condition condition 
Coconut oil.. avocado oil.. egg... 

Or apogee Under the dryer
105 2018-01-31 23:50:29 More texture, I think. I prefer cooking in olive oil, and have been known to add a little butter at the end.
106 2018-01-31 23:50:29 mmm. I don’t even know. I say try Almond Oil
107 2018-01-31 23:50:26 Hmm. I wonder if that decision has anything to do with the vast new BP oil fields.
108 2018-01-31 23:50:14 every skincare thread on twitter

- witch hazel/tea tree oil
- drink water!! 
109 2018-01-31 23:50:03 Why do you never mention your union leaders commerce banks miners oil Murdock do more damage to Australia then any union could do
110 2018-01-31 23:49:59 Oil change done. Tires rotated. Steering wheel fluid in the process.  was too lazy to put gas tho haha
111 2018-01-31 23:49:56 1) has BC stolen enough of a march to buy it's way into better tech, broader markets, 2) does BC simply aspire to be 1 of 3 or 4 global currencies (e.g. Dollar, GBP, Euro, Yen, Yuan), 3) replace oil, which, IMHO is gold
112 2018-01-31 23:49:47 As I recall, prez said we produce surplus.    Why risk the damage and deplete a resource we'll need in the future?  Why the risk to benefit a few at a cost to all?  It's America's oil.
113 2018-01-31 23:49:44 Hope the cbd oil helps. Friends mom uses it and says it works wonders...
114 2018-01-31 23:49:33 Swap to coconut oil. Not sticky, half the price of bepanthen. Only down side is it makes you crave Bounty bars like a motherfucker.
115 2018-01-31 23:49:26 Triple whammy (at least) -
1. Terrible week for Brexiteer nutjobs
2. Scottish Government budget passes stage 1
3. POLL RESULTS!

116 2018-01-31 23:49:08 อีนี้ก็เวอร์
117 2018-01-31 23:49:07 I’ll ask hubby tonight but I am pretty sure you do. He has one for the medicinal variety you smoke (which is higher in cbd than thc, not like a street drug) as well as the oil. He orders online through a special portal.
118 2018-01-31 23:49:06 the @CaseMate waterfall cases are so cute until you drop it once and theres oil everywhere . im so upset this is my second case - ruined .
119 2018-01-31 23:49:06 500+ is like for a pizza, French, or flatbread that will puff up and look rustic. White loaves with butter or milk are going to overbrown. Learn the burning points of the fats you use. Avoid extra virgin olive oil because the solids burn and turn bitter at those temperatures.
120 2018-01-31 23:49:05 <みなさんにとっての"オイル"とは何ですか⁇
121 2018-01-31 23:49:02 Lobster and crab fishermen do not give him money.  Oil barons do.
122 2018-01-31 23:48:47 :Its troubling 2 see the United States Cheer on more oil production when the world is awash in it .Save it for a rainy day
123 2018-01-31 23:48:46 people act like stopping this pipe will stop the oil from being produced. wrong, it just travels somewhere else via far more dangerous means through communities that aren't in your backyard via rail while transferring $ to corporations rather then the government.
124 2018-01-31 23:48:45 I ordered checks today, got an oil change, and didn't even get to see my paycheck for more than 5 hours.. why is adulting so fun
125 2018-01-31 23:48:40 But my ears  get crusty cuz they’re like. 60 year olds!  I have good hearing but yeah you can use baby  oil and petrochemical products cuz it’s just skin and sluffs off!
126 2018-01-31 23:48:33 SOS VENEZUELA  TAKE ALL THE OIL AND EVERYTHING AND GIVE US FREEEEDOOOOM!!! ASAP PLS
127 2018-01-31 23:48:32 Where is #SouthSudan in the #Nile discourse it seems like they are not even successful in exploiting it oil fields, for now.The Nile doesn’t seem to be their priority at this moment.Juba leaders are busy consolidating their grip on power and controlling the economy of the country
128 2018-01-31 23:48:31 People sing the praises of rosehip oil all the time, has it broke anyone else out? My skin is horrid rn.
129 2018-01-31 23:48:17 id say try an oil instead. not coconut oil like we already know that's a scam, but there's a lot of oils out here that are actually good cos they penetrate the skin barrier unlike most mosturizers and also help balance the oiliness so u dont produce the extra sebum
130 2018-01-31 23:47:57 I've never scrambled eggs in olive oil before; does it effect the taste at all?
131 2018-01-31 23:47:17 I made my own salad dressing with literally just avocado oil, garlic, sea salt and pepper...and it tastes so good
132 2018-01-31 23:47:11 With the tarriffs on solar products from China POS already hurt the industry. He won't stop until it's dead. Gotta keep the price of oil as high as possible & the USA totally dependent on petroleum products.
133 2018-01-31 23:47:00 Stands for Danish Oil And Gas. But yes also reminiscent of character from Sixteen Candles. And the company has now divested itself of fossil fuels and is the world's largest offshore wind company. And they are ready to start putting steel in the water off AC
134 2018-01-31 23:46:58 Bazzi you need that Habibi oil my man!!
135 2018-01-31 23:46:43 Been saying this for weeks (since Dec), it’s been a “solid” trade both on the petro-commodity #FX side & on the pure commodities side like #Gold $GC_F & #Oil $CL_F. In addition to playing $CAD & AUD, I also like $NZD & $MXN for same reasons.
136 2018-01-31 23:46:35 I would LOVE to know how the hemp oil goes.
137 2018-01-31 23:46:21 I've bought the Italian oil in the photo before and it tasted really good. My favourite from Lidl is their Greek EVOO. They also do one made with kalamata olives which tastes great. Their labeling definitely needs to improve, but I like the oil they sell.
138 2018-01-31 23:46:17 Haha I just got my oil changed today and went through this.
139 2018-01-31 23:45:47 โตล่ะยังมาให้เลี้ยงอีก
140 2018-01-31 23:45:47 Oil of Oregano. Tastes like shit but it works.
141 2018-01-31 23:45:38 Interestingly, I discovered the olive oil trick by accident just a week ago - I was clean out of butter and, in my own exhaustion, allowed the oil to warm to a near-sizzle. Unsure if it was the splash of soy milk, but they were exquisitly creamy and light. Next stop, hemp oil.
142 2018-01-31 23:45:37 I just started using castor oil to help my hair grow and I think it’s already working it’s littttt
143 2018-01-31 23:45:25 It’s A Ten spray when your hair is wet out of the shower, and Herbal Essences Wild naturals oil while it’s drying. And sometimes S factor Flat Iron shine spray if it’s dry and still frizzy. 
144 2018-01-31 23:45:24 As if my life couldn’t get any worse right now, I got my first cystic breakout. I haven’t gotten one in over a year. Thx rosehip oil 
145 2018-01-31 23:45:02 thinking more of a substitute for soya meal + oil in poultry rations. sting might be the price of the seed. Rapeseed has a higher field and oil ratio for biofuels.

147 2018-01-31 23:44:52 And the tories should thank Scotland for the 400 billion oil tax revenue over the past 40 years!
148 2018-01-31 23:44:51 Everything Trump says/does is designed to be emotional testosterone for impotent white people, otherwise known as the Trump base. Everything.

152 2018-01-31 23:44:32 I'm convinced white suburban moms all plan on getting their oil changed an hour before we close every single weekday
153 2018-01-31 23:44:26 Oil and gas industry still seeing lay offs. Example Chesapeake Energy lays off almost 400 employees. So, how can this be. 
154 2018-01-31 23:44:16 Why this one? There are so many oil stocks that have been crushed and that may be a safer play.

166 2018-01-31 23:43:31 Half truth.  They sending small car production to Mexico, bringing the profitable trucks and SUV's here.  Short sighted. Soon as oil prices spike again all those people hired will get laid off when people flock back to fuel efficient vehicles.  You better keep energy prices low.
167 2018-01-31 23:43:30 What time does Shawn knock off kanti. If he is burning the mudnight oil why aren't we seeing results.
168 2018-01-31 23:43:29 Most depressing state trivia so far. There are a trillion barrels of shale oil in Colorado.

173 2018-01-31 23:43:11 Think about it. This goes back to the $500 Billion oil deal with Russia that is on hold because of Obama's sanctions. Trump's entire energy agenda is oil and coal. Ask yourself why Tillerson is Sec of State. It's because Putin wanted him to be. Drop sanctions and the deal is a go
174 2018-01-31 23:43:11 one time my oil filter was so old it like, crumbled when the guy took it out and they just looked at me and shook their heads and that said a lot
175 2018-01-31 23:43:10 Really? Your window to social media is a product of oil.
176 2018-01-31 23:43:10 A sweet chocoholic ESTP oil heiress, tearing the seams of a gingham kimono, whispers secret confidences into the big soft ear of a frisky but sweet Basque mountain horse.
177 2018-01-31 23:43:10 That's a terrible one, but at least it stood for something. TM61 sounds like a type of motor oil.
178 2018-01-31 23:42:48 So my lovely father just decided to invade my room, look through all my drawers, threw away my candles, and all my food, my dishes( the tableware I had bought to eat kosher),  1 mango, 3 bananas, 2 packets of granola, my cereals,  1 bottle of unopened olive oil, milk,...brand new
179 2018-01-31 23:42:24 It may look like I got fenty gloss on my eyelids but it’s just oil cuz I’m an oily faced bitch. lol
180 2018-01-31 23:42:17 They're treating oil as if it were beer or wine! :)
181 2018-01-31 23:42:06 They could sign oil can Boyd and you sing his praises. Jesus dude, show a little objectivity. There's no law against criticizing your team when they stink.
182 2018-01-31 23:41:59 You sonny were two young to remember Peter Lougheed settled for a made in Canada price for oil...sold oil to eastern Canada for about half the international market price this was fostered by #PC’s for years even today Alta oil fetches only about half the mkt price! infrastructure
183 2018-01-31 23:41:40 NO VISION ON NEW PIPE LINES!!! Dumb regulations stopping companies to build. And Alberta oil is best!!!
184 2018-01-31 23:41:36 Coconut oil!
185 2018-01-31 23:41:23 I don’t know if I should be worried because my check engine light came on and I remembered that I don’t remember the last time I got an oil change.

190 2018-01-31 23:40:50 The Iraq invasion was only about Oil and the Heroin trade. Do some reading and maybe you will finally figure it out. After we went to Afganisysn Heroin production increased 500% FACT.
191 2018-01-31 23:40:36 When our beaches are covered in tar, who will want to visit San Diego? A few oil companies make a profit and leave a mess for us to clean up. No way!
192 2018-01-31 23:40:30 This is ETHNIC CLEANSING of Yezidis and Kurds in AFRIN Syria by TURKEY

193 2018-01-31 23:40:17 Many skin care specialists use Neostrata Chemical peels to treat acne and blemishes. It has the ability to balance the oil secretion and remove hyperpigmented patches and scars that resulted from acne. Higher strengths of Neostrata Chemical peels can reduce the appearance of new
194 2018-01-31 23:40:10 I probably wouldn’t go that far! Alberta is boom and bust! That’s oil! Unfortunately we are a little beyond bust! Maybe educated will actually vote next time!!!

198 2018-01-31 23:40:02 Omg girl I WISH. Shea butter works for me on my skin like magic but coconut oil in hair after I wash it and put my products in works wonders. Have you tried rose oil on your skin? That shit is good too lol
199 2018-01-31 23:39:59 Biafrans are christains, they support America and Isreal knowing that they have something in common but why are they abbandoned in the hands of terrorist group of Buhari, herdsmen and their creator British government for their oil business gain

201 2018-01-31 23:39:42 I find that essential oils are really great! Tbh, I'm not entirely sure if they actually "work" (like if it's the oil itself that's making me feel better), but I DO know that when I'm anxious or I have a stomach/headache, having one specific smell to focus on is really helpful!
202 2018-01-31 23:39:11 got my oil changed and now i’m at the gym, we love being masc
203 2018-01-31 23:39:07 So to confirm, your all for pipelines and oil tankers, have them lining up in English bay !!! It’s just Alberta oil you don’t like?
204 2018-01-31 23:39:02 Still cheaper than having an unsaleable oil burner....
205 2018-01-31 23:39:01 *Put more oil on the kart* Heh HEH heh #Dingobot
206 2018-01-31 23:38:59 "She's like olive oil, extra virgin" 
207 2018-01-31 23:38:56 Em... i have used all the baby oil for other purposes... (draw a discreet vale). Luckily the ceiling is far out of my reach even in my rage.
208 2018-01-31 23:38:50 One time I told someone that I wanted to "make my anime art look like oil paintings" and I'm p sure the same person will never let me live it down
209 2018-01-31 23:38:49 Well, after changing my oil 3 days ago, my check engine and check oil lights FINALLY turned off
210 2018-01-31 23:38:48 you guys realize that all that oil just travels via train track instead? thats far more dangerous then pipeline. just ask the town in Quebec that got blown up by one.  stopping this pipe keeps tankers off the coast yes, but you're just shifting that oil to different locations.
211 2018-01-31 23:38:23 for a healthier option, substitute your bong water with oil of oregano
212 2018-01-31 23:38:08 Don't care gotta buy oil from his backers

219 2018-01-31 23:36:58 If a nickel of my taxes goes to feed the hungry in a disaster ravaged US TERRITORY instead of an oil subsidy or a defense contractor’s account, I’M GOOD WITH IT. Why, sir, aren’t you?

226 2018-01-31 23:35:54 #TYTLive How interesting how Republicans have been changing the English language. Infrastructure used to mean roads and bridges, not oil and gas pipes with environmental spill. This party needs to die before they kill all of us.
227 2018-01-31 23:35:50 i tried the coconut oil but not the salmon diet...!!!! ive only tried switching up his proteins but not salmon yet. i will defintely look into that thanks so much!
228 2018-01-31 23:35:48 The best rain is when I'm a businessman  in 1898 and a deep well has been dug on the new plot of drilling land I stole from a poor farmer and it sprays oil that rains upon my head, the smell of labor, of success, of fortune, I am finally the man my family thought I would never be
229 2018-01-31 23:35:46 My old supervisor from the oil field got me on snap chat today and said “when you coming back” Ughhhh the temptation is so real because that money is so good to my bank account!!! 
230 2018-01-31 23:35:24 The American people are dumb any how so the snake oil salesman Trump can say anything
231 2018-01-31 23:35:19 See i don’t know how i feel about this, we used tea tree oil on pepper and Ava and they never reacted, even with my diffuser at home I’ve. Used it a few times but nothing.
232 2018-01-31 23:35:11 Kim, I just ordered for the 1st time & had a question about the toning oil - does it help with psoriasis or eczema ?
233 2018-01-31 23:35:11 Pruitt the man who doesn’t know his job! He’s just a Trumps lap fog. Coal bad water good. Oil & gas bad solar good. Clean streams good. Fish in the ocean good. 3 headed frogs bad.  Regulations good Pruitt bad

238 2018-01-31 23:34:37 Only reason to keep pushing pipelines is oil companies have offered some type of personal reward to politician who achieves pipeline construction.I'm not receiving any pipeline money neither is any Albertan ideal situation  no pipeline money for anyone  great doing fine without
239 2018-01-31 23:34:31 Went to get an oil change today and they told me I needed two new tires.

In other words they like being losers.
242 2018-01-31 23:34:14 NDP doesn't have the support to be Fed gov't leader. 
But I am amazed at the amount of abuse Notley is taking, for fighting FOR AB oil. It is never the right thing, right time, right amount, right anything, for Cons. You want to see this pipeline fail, b/c of your hate of her.
243 2018-01-31 23:34:08 A drop or 2 of olive oil then stir.
244 2018-01-31 23:34:04 .@PGE4Me crews working to support clean up efforts in the #BearRiver after this mornings tanker truck accident on #Highway20. There is no indication that any fuel or oil entered the Drum Canal.
245 2018-01-31 23:34:02 that can’t be fixed, that’s past the point of just needing oil

258 2018-01-31 23:32:26 babysitting chronicles: they have "all natural" peanut butter which has like an inordinate amount of oil at the top. I put some on crackers for the LO and he know has peanut butter all over his pants.
259 2018-01-31 23:31:53 Dat's the best stuff. 
I use it on pretty much everything, Nuln Oil not so much, but is a "good to have"

Be aware....they are SO EASY to knock over and will stain EVERYTHING.

275 2018-01-31 23:30:33 Never worked for oil live in Alberta my whole life.Pipeline not a priority1000's of other non oil jobs.more full time jobs created by wind solar geothermal and cross over from oil than a few Tempory pipeline jobs lost to defending the environment I'm moving to a clean BC someday
276 2018-01-31 23:30:30 Stopped using coconut oil on my face a few days ago and I already see a difference.
277 2018-01-31 23:30:21 If your skin isn’t sensitive you should try the exfoliation pad and see if it werks! Mine was like a combination of oily/dry skin and stress and scrubbing the shit out of my face helped unclog my pores from the dead skin and oil!
278 2018-01-31 23:30:19 yasss! i speak to people who have a 2 step routine and i’m always like “that’s not enough ” i love paulas choice for my cleanser, toner, & exfoliant (i switch between AHA & BHA)! bio-oil is a face oil i enjoy! & i switch between moisturizers depending on my skin that day!
279 2018-01-31 23:30:19 And the olive oil with the rendered fat of Barbary ducks
280 2018-01-31 23:30:09 So if you want the best Tabouli in the Chicago Area (with suburbs) - KababQ  in willow brook is AMAZING. The lemon + olive oil ratio is on point. It’s NOT dry, which is a miracle.
281 2018-01-31 23:30:00 Pipelines are at capacity, and the US is producing 10 million barrels of oil per day, so demand is down.
282 2018-01-31 23:29:56 Faye; 55 percent of vancouver’s petroleum products come from edmonton refineries (oil sands).  The rest us supplied from washington state (california oil - some of which has a higher GHG intensity than oil sands).  You may want to fact check champ...
283 2018-01-31 23:29:47 I wouldn't mess with their Oil, because they need Heat for the Winter.
284 2018-01-31 23:29:42 THANK GOD WE HAVENT BURNED ANY OIL!!!!
285 2018-01-31 23:29:38 Nobody go to Fast Eddies in Mount Pleasant to get your oil changed!!!! That’s where I went last weekend, and my car completely shut down today and wouldn’t even start bc there was no oil in it. What a great way to spend $80 
286 2018-01-31 23:29:29 Maybe they need some CBD oil.
287 2018-01-31 23:29:02 The world's most valuable resource is no longer oil  but data - economist

288 2018-01-31 23:28:46 OK, that explains the oil companies. What about "average joe" people? Everyone has their personal fortunes tied up in oil company stocks? What's in it for them to buy into the oil company denialism?
289 2018-01-31 23:28:38 I love that oil too......almost as much as the pro collagen marine cream....this tsv is a good'un....
290 2018-01-31 23:28:30 Especially now that we've tariffed solar panels out of the market.  Or... oh, wait. When you say "energy independce", do you mean "just oil"?
291 2018-01-31 23:28:25 I took my car for oil change and they asked for my number so they can call when its ready. The guy that checked me out kept my number and added me on snapchat. CANT TRUST THESE NIGGAS creepin’!
292 2018-01-31 23:28:14 I s2g chamomile oil has some sort of spiritual feeling to it when you fucking diffuse that shit. The herb shop is so cute though.
293 2018-01-31 23:27:59 What's wrong with a sweet potato? Slice thick or thin, coat with olive oil and salt, roast, and eat!

296 2018-01-31 23:27:46 Also the US is helping Venezuela by buying their oil. Vzla boomed in 70s due to high oil prices but now relies virtually solely on oil exports for revenue. Low oil prices = low govt revenue plus no sovereign wealth fund = crazy bonds and brink of default.
297 2018-01-31 23:27:41 Coconut oil gave me the most horrifying cystic acne oh man I still have nightmares
298 2018-01-31 23:27:34 We could have energy independence if we put more into renewables and less on oil and gas.  Guess you don’t have grandkids who will need fresh air and water.  We already have water problems.  Read the science!

301 2018-01-31 23:27:24 sicko scotty you lodt you’re credibility years ago!so stop the charade will u! bringing back coal, oil pipeline’s?? ur archaic thinking positively ridiculous! SOLAR& RENEWALABLE ENERGY is the future, get onboard or get out of the way #BOUGHT&SOLDSNOT
302 2018-01-31 23:27:17 How horrible that this mayor has traveled to such exotic locations like Franklin and Fort Campbell! And the nerve to take her security with her! Boil her in oil! Next she will be taking 3 million dollar weekends to golf in Florida. Wake up people, she's just doing her job.
303 2018-01-31 23:27:09 Me: omg did you know the tree oil is toxic to cats and dogs??!

Naomi: omg is that the stuff at the bottom of the Christmas tree? 

Me: .....no.

305 2018-01-31 23:27:02 Could we make you and Alberta responsible for the cost of any and all oil spills?
306 2018-01-31 23:26:53 My house smells of these two scents all the time  just randomly butting in to share how happy I am about this fact lol! Vanilla (and slightly coconut-ish) scent from the laundry, and I use pure jasmine oil as a perfume. I think we have similar tastes 
307 2018-01-31 23:26:52 I wouldn’t even be able to count the number of people on two hands who come into GNC DAILY and ask if we have CBD oil or gummies. With how popular it would be, I wish we would be able to sell it
308 2018-01-31 23:26:50 @basssque only way they say something is if someone asks them a direct question about it. Only thing their investors care about is more oil.
309 2018-01-31 23:26:36 El mediano y pequeño productor tuvo respuestas concretas y rápidas del Gobierno. Los que hoy están en la #vigilia son aquellos que piden quitar los planes del mides para que a ellos les bajen costo del gas oil, ratas inmundas apestosas.
310 2018-01-31 23:26:29 hoping dis tea tree oil works !!!!!! :(
311 2018-01-31 23:26:17 Are you kidding me? 
The markets are on the same growth trend that they have been on since 2009. 
Unemployment has been dropping since 2009. 
This is NOT due to Trump! 
Job growth in the US has slowed. Major companies are laying off staff. 
Look at the big picture, not just oil.
312 2018-01-31 23:26:09 Tea tree oil is life
313 2018-01-31 23:25:54 Tea tree oil is really strong and is used for things like poison ivy idk why this person would diffuse it in the first place like it’s not for that purpose....

315 2018-01-31 23:25:45 Yes.  But it is important to note the difference in production, too.  Different oil mix, and different production dynamics, with faster depletion, and higher EUR costs.  It is impressive, but it is important to not compare the two, just on production #'s alone.

319 2018-01-31 23:25:15 Green energy is cheaper than oil and gas.   Cheaper than nuclear, too
320 2018-01-31 23:25:15 When you're making a double batch of brownies but are short 2/3 of oil 
321 2018-01-31 23:25:10 Had it ever been cleaned? Was it just yellowed varnish or was there environmental issues (e.g., smoke/oil lamps/grime) as well?
322 2018-01-31 23:25:07 We could have been building these pipelines, and developing other markets years ago - we didn't. Cons thought that the oil industry would last forever. For some reason, no one ever thinks the next crash will come - and it always does.
323 2018-01-31 23:25:04 Lol obv you know nothing about current affairs and geopolitics. Knowing how to shill a crypto doesn’t make you smart. I worked in oil & gas there. I know how it works. > 95% export industry = oil, and no govt revenue since oil price tanked. You have a duty to warn your followers.
324 2018-01-31 23:25:03 HAHAHA brainwasher. Sell your snake oil somewhere else... Tick Tock
325 2018-01-31 23:25:00 To think there is a statue to Donald Dewar in Glasgow. The man who. with Tony Blair. was responsible for secretly transferring some of Scotland's oil and gas rich sea to England on the eve of devolution.

327 2018-01-31 23:24:49 Most trains for sure, whether mixed freight or unit train. The only ones that don’t have oil tankers are unit trains with shipping containers and mixed freight trains with boxcars containing auto vehicles usually don’t have any- sometimes just a few.
328 2018-01-31 23:24:48 Democrats seem satisfied. Heroin is killing people, according to them border is secure and everything is fine. Not a problem to them.
329 2018-01-31 23:24:42 Let’s just hope our vehicles last till the next oil change 
330 2018-01-31 23:24:27 For the record, the recipe is:

Put cornmeal in a bowl with enough salt; add water until it looks right.

Put some oil in a skillet & heat to right temp.

Add spoonfuls of mix, appropriately spaced, and fry until it's time to turn.

Turn.

Pull & drain on paper towels.

331 2018-01-31 23:24:24 Once cooked add a bit of cold Extra Virgin Olive Oil and a bit of Rock or Sea Salt. 
332 2018-01-31 23:24:08 Oh, you mean the Conservatives that spent 10 years not planning for any other markets than sending our oil to the US.  OK.  
I know - you want to blame everything on Trudeau. No go. They are ALL to blame.

337 2018-01-31 23:23:45 You are dreaming!!  .....up a scheme to buy oil from russssssia!!
338 2018-01-31 23:23:44 Why have a fund specifically for the oil industry, why not the coal industry, financial sector, steel industry, engineering sector etc etc etc, all made and making money for the UK.

341 2018-01-31 23:23:29 Q6: support adoption of carbon tax? K: climate change demonstrates how broken our political system is. Have to look at how to fix it... remove subsidies for oil and gas (not a word about a carbon tax...)
342 2018-01-31 23:23:00 The Justin Trudeau Liberals talk about supporting energy jobs but why are they not taking BC NDP govt to task on blocking Alberta’s oil exports west? This is a national project and we need the national govt to stand up to BC.
343 2018-01-31 23:22:58 OMG I don't like it either, but for the opposite reason. I'm super oily and when I used it, it collected in creases and lines when my oil started peeking through and seemed to cake up into the oils. It was gross. Returned it and never bought again.
344 2018-01-31 23:22:44 Oh we are already ontop of the ginger, soup and raw honey. Even Manuka honey and oil of oregano!

356 2018-01-31 23:21:18 If we are to believe the Yoons we'll have to share just 5 of them between everyone in Scotland & they'll be horse drawn because there's no oil to make petrol or diesel.

369 2018-01-31 23:19:09 Hi, our ambition remains to end deforestation. In 2013 we adjusted our strategy to focus on improving traceability. We can now trace over 90% of the palm oil we source back to the mill of origin and almost half back to the plantation level.

373 2018-01-31 23:18:38 No. Resources belong to the provinces. We subsidize Quebec and Ontario heavily with our oil despite a crashing economy. Time to put Alberta first. We’re tired of being raped.

376 2018-01-31 23:18:32 Our countries engine has totally failed as we have mixed oil ( politics) and water (religion) together. political parties are a making mockery of all religions with a media show and clergy is also enjoying a moment of glory standing besides those corrupted

380 2018-01-31 23:18:08 okay but have tou have them cooked really well bc I stan. Steamed brussels sprouts? Disgusting. But like... roasted in garlic and olive oil? Oh yeah
381 2018-01-31 23:18:05 Didn't we learn during #StandingRock that you can build an oil pipeline without an environmental review?  But I guess that's not as potentially impactful as a bike trail on an already paved road.

387 2018-01-31 23:17:08 I love how you quote stats in 2027 and 2030.    These probably emanate from the same people who predicted we would run out of oil by the year 2000.
388 2018-01-31 23:17:06 You mean like the regulations where our air is clean, our water is clean, our coastlines are not polluted with oil spills, pesticides aren't sprayed and kill bees...thats just the beginning of the list of incompetence you've shown, these regulations were in place to protect us...
389 2018-01-31 23:16:53 Dude! I wish you had that listed on your page (along with a real name, linked to a real person)!!! I wouldn't have wasted our time. I mean, you have every reason to lick Trump's ball. Big oil is better than "coal", right? Hope God forgives your greed fueled blinders.

394 2018-01-31 23:16:24 Yes! You are right! If... you happen to be an oil co. executive or a member of the 1% Congrats! You have an administration that works for your narrow interests!  The rest of America and the world is getting a crap deal.

419 2018-01-31 23:14:01 It's because of the assaults. But it does highlight the fact that America is very inward focused -- which is how they've got away with their proxy wars on behalf of oil for so long.
420 2018-01-31 23:13:57 The CEOs of the oil industry still take in millions per year and resist environmental regulations. Find me a single Silicon Valley CEO who doesn’t vehemently support environmental regulations. Both are rich and powerful, but only one group denies science in favor of profit
421 2018-01-31 23:13:49 .@BOEM_DOI Stop sacrificing nature for the benefit of oil & gas companies! Stop the expansion of offshore drilling in the U.S. Don’t place our coastal communities, beaches, surf breaks, and marine ecosystems at risk of a catastrophic oil spill! #surfrider #DrillingIsKilling

431 2018-01-31 23:13:02 You are right Bella, sunlight on Starlings brings out the “oil slick” colour that they have instead of the more ordinary black with white flecks.                You are just sooooo smart Bella
432 2018-01-31 23:12:57 Your tweet is ignorance personified.  The rest of the world understands that we need to get away from relying on polluting oil and coal and towards greener energy for the sake of the planet and our health.  Wake up.
433 2018-01-31 23:12:53 ooh I had a whole skincare journey in 2016 when I was poor af and moved to a place with contaminated water. bioré charcoal face wash, thayers witch hazel w/ rose petal (***no alcohol) and sweet almond oil - each is $10 or less and lasts for months as long as you don’t abuse it

443 2018-01-31 23:11:32 In Luke 12:38, Jesus says, “If He should come in the second watch, or in the third watch, and find them so [watching, i.e., abiding], blessed are those servants.” (The second watch is 9 pm - 12 am, and the third is 12 am - 3 am. The lamps of the foolish run out of oil around 12.)
444 2018-01-31 23:11:22 LFC Twitter, you have the nerve. 

We moved to 3rd in the table today and all everyone is complaining about are the lack of signings. 

Get behind the current squad or support another team that has oil money.
445 2018-01-31 23:11:09 How is it "giving to the Palestinians" when Israel continues to seal Palestinians land, oil, gas, water etc

453 2018-01-31 23:10:14 Are you kidding me Dick.  If this is the case why does trip want to dramatically increase military spending and drill and produce more oil.  Also if you read @SaraCarterDC or listened to her you would know that there is NO TRUMP RUSSIAN COLLUSION
454 2018-01-31 23:10:10 おはぽんぽん！
455 2018-01-31 23:10:03 Castor Oil!!
456 2018-01-31 23:09:59 It produces bio-kerosene which is both jet fuel and heating oil.  Given the amount of oil heating used in Scotland I'd go for that.
457 2018-01-31 23:09:56 Gotta start thinking globally.  He is putting this country in a position to mainly export oil and gas. Greatbut our world is dying because we use these resources instead of renewables.  What happens to our children and grandchildren?  What selfishness.
458 2018-01-31 23:09:54 Don’t bullshit me. And how’s Trump’s non existent war on that opioid crisis going?
459 2018-01-31 23:09:15 Much like the whole oil industry. Notley, Wall: what do they not get?

462 2018-01-31 23:08:58 Few drops of lavender oil in the bath but as you know, take care.
463 2018-01-31 23:08:53 They aren't worried, there's oooooodles of Scottish oil & gas. More new fields coming online all the time. It kep the uk afloat through the Thatcher years, it'll do the same through Brexit.  .......unless ....... we decide not to put up with this mince anymore....
464 2018-01-31 23:08:52 You are correct. In Mexico the government owns and runs every thing. Oil, gas, utilities, everything. The people are poor, politicians are rich. That is exactly what the radical Democratic socialist want for the USA. Absolute control.

467 2018-01-31 23:08:33 By that I mean EVERYONE has a trilogy, a decent cover, and a catalog of 5-star reviews.  Not that we want to limit publishing in any way; it's not like authors are selling snake oil, just $4 ebooks.  But it must be impossible to know what to read.

484 2018-01-31 23:05:56 I believe the government is planning to build loads of modular refineries in the Niger Delta region.

487 2018-01-31 23:05:33 Is this like re-enacting In The Kitchen? By some butter rolls? Or like a kinky thing where instead of wax you get off on the popping oil in a skillet hitting you? Stirring the macaroni in roux while making eye contact?

494 2018-01-31 23:04:36 I think the error of the foolish virgins is assuming the bridegroom is coming earlier. I think they would have brought extra flasks of oil like the wise if they were at all prepared that he could take longer.
495 2018-01-31 23:04:33 Gee, I wonder why Canada doesn't export more oil. Hmmmm.  It couldn't have anything to do with lack of adequate pipelines to tidewater.

500 2018-01-31 23:03:44 I’ve lived there. The country is nearly bankrupt as their only export is oil. The government is corrupt, parliament silenced, courts complicit. Inflation out of control. People starving. This is fact. Read the news over the last 3 years. You DO NOT want to touch this crypto.
501 2018-01-31 23:03:41 Obama sold off our oil surplus what he do with the money because he did not pay China the whole time he was in office
502 2018-01-31 23:03:31 Sarah, much as I love you, we do not *yet* have the means to live without fossil fuels. We could be moving that way much faster but for the Oil Barons' obstructionism. Check out Vaclav Smil on energy transitions, and how long they take.
503 2018-01-31 23:03:29 We're all responsible for dependence on oil. It's no good trying to absolve us from responsibility & blame someone else

516 2018-01-31 23:01:49 This is nothing but economic treason. The #RenewableEnergy industry is the future. Trump and his oil cartel billionaires are enemies of humanity with their climate change denials, anti-science mentality as well as autocratic attacks on capitalism.  We must remove them from power.

543 2018-01-31 22:57:52 1) I lived in Venezuela in 2012. The economy is a shambles and the government is corrupt. Inflation is out of control. >95% of export industry is oil and government revenue is collapsed since oil price crashed.

550 2018-01-31 22:57:04 Perhaps there should be a ban on oil/non-biodegradable plastics and industry forced to create/use #Hemp (for eg) based plastics or fully biodegradable products.

Governments need to step up and force change, that's what leaders do.

Can't just bury everything.

564 2018-01-31 22:55:21 How exactly is requiring oil companies to demonstrate the ability to clean up oil spills (for which they have abysmal track records) undermining the environmental pillar?
565 2018-01-31 22:55:19 Yeah - Roman baths! There’s a clue. Romans used oil to clean and Gauls used animal fat soap.  #wiki

567 2018-01-31 22:55:08 I’m reading that Trump’s infrastructure plan is to privatize our water systems. Of course it is. Water is the New Oil. We pay more for less. The new American way.

573 2018-01-31 22:54:32 #World Is Russia Worried About North Korea? Kim Jong Un Would Consider 'War' If UN Cut His Oil, Ambassador Says - Newsweek
574 2018-01-31 22:54:23 *my car sobbing* please get an oil change
575 2018-01-31 22:54:06 I mean, if you’re using fresh oil.
576 2018-01-31 22:54:04 Remember in 1980 when experts predicted oil would peak, and run out in 1990's, in facts in the preceding decades those predictions of peak production were repeated on a regular basis, again, and again.
577 2018-01-31 22:53:55 Utah you voted for Trump and this is your reward. Beautiful state. I need to see it before oil derricks dot the landscape.
578 2018-01-31 22:53:50 How dumb can people get? 
Ronaldo's transfer is worth £99.6m taking inflation rates into consideration and before Arabs started to splash in oil cash. Pogba and Bale are still at £92m and £94m respectively. 

And you think Neymar's cost was excluding his brand value? Delusion SMH
579 2018-01-31 22:53:45 Ans some adrak like zakir some chilli powder like aleena and oil like maryam and some koilay like imam
580 2018-01-31 22:53:43 Yea, when the oil runs out will solar panels and windmills generate the required electricity for these data servers to continue running? I think not. #peakoil #googlesucks #solarpanels #economist #microsoftsucks

582 2018-01-31 22:52:57 Once or twice a year I forget why I don't take Omega 3 (fish oil) supplements, so I pop a couple from the long neglected bottle in my cabinet along with my daily multi and various other supplements. 

Those days are bad days... Fishy burp days.
583 2018-01-31 22:52:48 Since Trump wants to make US world’s #1 oil producer, when that happens, US homeowners should be paying 50 cents a gallon for heating oil & gasoline If and when, we become #1 oil producing country, REMEMBER this tweet.
584 2018-01-31 22:52:18 We've ended the war on beautiful clean oil
585 2018-01-31 22:52:18 Very disappointed with @MiltonRuben they charged me double what I have paid at any dodge dealership to change my oil and didn't even reset my engine computer. What else didn't they do right? Scared to drive across country now.  #Pricegouging #badbusiness #takingadvantageofawoman
586 2018-01-31 22:52:15 Free oil change came in clutch
587 2018-01-31 22:52:13 I never wanted yanks at the club or some oil rich sheikhs with dodgy human rights records either. Or the Chinese..or a ropey English millionaire businessman.

I wanted a billionaire scouser, lifelong red to take ownership.

But we live in the real world not fantasy.
588 2018-01-31 22:52:08 Its a pretty hard pitch for new investment into oil and gas in alberta at the moment. unless you have existing infrastructure - go south and make money
589 2018-01-31 22:52:04 word is Mathieu Flamini is on his way back too. part of the Oil deal.. ha
590 2018-01-31 22:51:55 Gently warmed up pure olive oil also does the trick :))))
591 2018-01-31 22:51:47 @gtrim @morphnad cyclical companies do not follow the price of oil on the dot. Big projects require sustained prices for longer periods

596 2018-01-31 22:51:20 it's not oil money tho is it? it's a National Airway money.

598 2018-01-31 22:51:15 not sure who said but my favourite oil related quote "it will be obsolete before we run out of it" 
599 2018-01-31 22:51:10 Looking for a job in oil country will be the death of me... #plzhireme
600 2018-01-31 22:50:50 I read that it’s toxic for them to ingest, or if rubbed on their skin as an ointment. the problem arises if it isn’t diluted properly so maybe your oil contains a high percentage (close to 100%) and you use it very often?
601 2018-01-31 22:50:43 So Happy for you Bud !! #BigTimeFullTime
602 2018-01-31 22:50:41 You're right, non vegan/vege products like egg whites, gelatin, fish oil & casein are added during filtration process however, vegan alternatives are available producing the same result, such as clay based agents, activated charcoal. Not advertising on bottle is also a problem.
603 2018-01-31 22:50:35 Did Tillerson tell him to hook up his buddys in the oil biz? Kill other energy sources
604 2018-01-31 22:50:33 uhmmm what happened to the castor oil? 
605 2018-01-31 22:50:23 My natural followers , what kind of oil do you put in your hair ?
606 2018-01-31 22:50:16 This doesn't negate the point you make because oil price was high at indyref, but it's worth understanding that 'reserves' means 'commercially viable reserves' - so a higher oil price will mean reserves increase.
607 2018-01-31 22:50:16 Not enough coal in the US. We need better alternatives.
Also does not help shipping oil through our country for other to use.
608 2018-01-31 22:49:59 We don't have unlimited oil money funds bro. It's not that hard to comprehend.
609 2018-01-31 22:49:45 Right.. do they all use coconut oil?
610 2018-01-31 22:49:43 True they bought Isis oil with the approval of USA and EU who were in cahoots with them , it was Russia who exposed this and did something about it
611 2018-01-31 22:49:43 I'm waiting for my oil to be changed and for my car to be cleaned, I am so lonely
612 2018-01-31 22:49:42 As a geologist I do tire a bit of seeing this one over and over again.  It's always been data, from the first spear that worked well for cavemen, to the first oil well.  The technology for data changes and the ability to invest in it changes, but data has always been king.
613 2018-01-31 22:49:41 Come on...can't you see he is multi tasking...rebuttal and oil change all in one fell swoop!
614 2018-01-31 22:49:34 Explain Burdensome regulations? Obama kinda put them in place so our kids and grandkids  wouldn't be breathing in polluted air or swimming through oil and garbage  in our oceans, rivers, and lakes. Why would anyone in their right mind take us backwards? RU kidding me?
615 2018-01-31 22:49:34 @Ford I need some explaining! I have a Ford Fusion 2013. I go into the dealer to get a oil change. They say there is a recall on your car. We might have to replace the engine? They did get me a rental for free. But it's been a week still I haven't had my car back. No parts in.
616 2018-01-31 22:49:32 Solar. Done. You subsidize oil companies drilling dry holes. Everyone heard "solar" and thinks "liberal" without realizing the extent to which fossil fuels are subsidized. Those lobbyists are very, very effective.
617 2018-01-31 22:49:30 It is a problem, and the Oil thing doesn’t make it any better than any other ICO, it is more like a scam ICO, specially when all its Oil production it’s already being used to pay debt for years to come
618 2018-01-31 22:49:21 Iran guards the Caspian Sea and it's major resources.  Half of which is Russia's main Oil and LNG fields with the Volga region transport system.  There is nothing you can give Russia for that.  No promise.  No piece of land.  No ports.  Nada.
619 2018-01-31 22:49:04 @ChunkyLover @morphnad this is an opportunity of a lifetime .. the stock just got de-risked with the debt refinance + oil sustaining $60+..
620 2018-01-31 22:49:01 Despite not liking the product hat I used to substitute for olive oil , this stuffed chicken came out bomb 
621 2018-01-31 22:49:00 ああオイル、どうして君はオイルなんだ…
622 2018-01-31 22:48:58 The world’s most valuable resource is no longer oil, but data
623 2018-01-31 22:48:29 Oil for data
624 2018-01-31 22:48:28 Not sure how we can have “fair” online races, I’ve just ranked up to level 2 and got oil slick, it’ll take quite a while to rank up and get everything - still think you should have settings or at least a DD1 Preset so an online race is played with all the same power ups
625 2018-01-31 22:48:21 More Scottish oil discovered for Westmidden to drain to pay for Brexit. Wake up Scotland!
626 2018-01-31 22:48:14 Venezuela to launch their own cryptocurrency "Petro" backed by their oil reserves. Smart move given the current crises. Will be interesting how this will play out in terms of trading with other countries.
627 2018-01-31 22:48:10 Please, you first.  Go ahead & live without oil & NatGas as well.  Recall your childhood?  Before LA? In NY?  Where you had winter?  Can anybody live without oil & NatGas also?  Kudos to @FirstSolar for latest thin-film innovation solar, but not gonna work everywhere.
628 2018-01-31 22:48:03 Reminds me of the old "even if we start drilling today, we won't get a drop of oil for 5 years" that I've been hearing since the 70's
629 2018-01-31 22:47:57 Peak Oil?
630 2018-01-31 22:47:56 Ridiculous. Imagine if the oil ran dry tonight... Why don't you Economists think on that, then write a story on it. Forget Peak Oil theory... The last drop of oil pumped tonight... Then the world collapses into chaos... The middle East goes first because no jobs for millions...
631 2018-01-31 22:47:47 4/ Venezuela demonstrates why Canada should NOT increase oil and gas as a % of our GDP and exports.
632 2018-01-31 22:47:33 So that's only the coconut oil one?

637 2018-01-31 22:47:07 Lmfaoooooooooo when your leaving after the oil change tho lm crying
638 2018-01-31 22:47:05 Only makes sense if you're determined to continue promoting oil and coal at any cost. And we know he is.
639 2018-01-31 22:47:01 @WMUR9 just saw news article showing oil deliveries but discussion was all about propane??
640 2018-01-31 22:46:59 Dating a married man is fun untill you discover he saved your number as engine oil
641 2018-01-31 22:46:59 Has the turning circle of an oil tanker and always seems half asleep. Need Bailly back asap. Jones and Smalling are limited. Ahead of them Matic moved like a wardrobe.
642 2018-01-31 22:46:36 3/ capitalism in countries with better infrastructure. Canada had a mild recession because our % of risk was so much less. Albertans know what oil price means. Imagine being 6x more dependent on it.
643 2018-01-31 22:46:25 Ahhh, interesting. I have an oil like that from the Body Shop that I like. Never thought to use it that way though...
644 2018-01-31 22:46:07 I ate no choice food; no meat or wine came to my lips, nor did I anoint myself with oil until the end of those three weeks.  Daniel 10:3
645 2018-01-31 22:46:03 But you did hear the words "honestly", "coal", and "oil".
646 2018-01-31 22:45:59 Not an opinion he helped write the bloody thing, anyway care to tell me how much tax is raised from oil in Scotland and remember the UK budget this financial year was over £710bn.
647 2018-01-31 22:45:57 That’s a really nice photo; love the flowers. I also used to be in pretty bad pain, but I have healed Completely from that ever since I started on this oil. Let me know if you’re interested I’d be happy to share it with you
648 2018-01-31 22:45:40 Oh  I can give you anointing oil to add to your prayers
649 2018-01-31 22:45:40 Then you’re not paying attention!!! He’s told us and shown us for decades who he is! He’s a grifter, a snake oil salesman, a con man. SMDH...

it's SO DISGUSTING I HATE IT
like why tf are people PROMOTING this and going "MMMMM" like
do you have a stomach of STEEL.... YOGHURT is sometimes too much for my arse
651 2018-01-31 22:45:34 This is not just about oil.  What if someday we wanted to establish exports of low carbon bioliquids, ammonia or methanol as energy carriers?  The same challenges would apply.  Canada has a track record of "extraction now, deal with consequences later". This has to change.
652 2018-01-31 22:45:34 Iraq defended itself from a illegal attack from USA & UK . 

Any country can defend itself . 

All those British soldiers would be alive if Blair had not lied with the help of your media to trick the public into believing in WMD ... 

Blood for oil .
653 2018-01-31 22:45:20 Today's internet reminds me of the wild west- a rocky landscape of pioneers and trailblazers railroaded by tycoons, bandits, charlatans and snake oil salesman.
654 2018-01-31 22:45:18 what Oil wells? Pep never spends anyway & i'm glad you mentioned Mahrez,City don't have enough money to get him over the line, If that was Piano FC, you would have got all your "notes" out  (quite literally)  - #PianoFC ,& yes still LFC, but no harm in stating facts to u 
655 2018-01-31 22:45:13 Where else in the world would a massive oil field be discovered and it would only merit 10 seconds on their National News Channel?
656 2018-01-31 22:45:09 It's just oil basically, like rose hip or argan oil are common, lots of moisturizers have oils in them tho. I've started using it because my combo skin is getting so dry this winter! Found it moisturizers better for me
657 2018-01-31 22:44:59 Because he is beholden to big oil.
658 2018-01-31 22:44:49 What goes around will definitely..... I will pour oil not salt to your wound. Glory glory....
659 2018-01-31 22:44:42 Oh yes, Argan oil, right? Good stuff! Yeah, I think not overdoing it with products is wise.
660 2018-01-31 22:44:28 * check the brakes squeeze the tyres oil the chain
661 2018-01-31 22:44:20 Oil money making the most competitive league in the world a joke
662 2018-01-31 22:43:52 Boxing has become a gimmick in the past few years. We’ve got away from the “teachers” and went towards the snake oil salesmen. The “pad guy”, the S&C coaches. Flashy mitt routines and cross fit type exercises are appealing to those that don’t know any better. #preservetheteacher

667 2018-01-31 22:43:29 It’s a miracle, the oil was finished in 2014 and now Scotland has more than it knows what do with it. Surely the yoons didn’t lie did they.

672 2018-01-31 22:42:52 Oil is used globally, not just in USA, because we cannot live without it. Ask Soros, his flying brothel consumes a boatload.
673 2018-01-31 22:42:49 Bout to change my oil and do my taxes cuz I don't trust people doing simple shit. 

*Stares into mirror*

674 2018-01-31 22:42:47 Got the humidifier going with eucalyptus oil 
675 2018-01-31 22:42:47 So there is no oil in Akwa Ibom. No oil in Bayelsa. No oil in Ondo. No oil in Edo. Wake up man and hear the sound of Fulani nationalism
676 2018-01-31 22:42:46 It’s all about the money. Specifically: Arctic oil money, Kushner and Trump real estate money, Russian oligarch laundering of money. #sanctions #TrumpRussiaConspiracy #TrumpRussiaTreason

679 2018-01-31 22:42:16 That investment money is already fleeing this Province.  Just look at Nat Gas. Every other jurisdiction is moving ahead and we're moving backwards.  This is also true of oil fracking.  The US will soon export oil and break production records.  Why invest in Canada?

685 2018-01-31 22:41:44 I tried cinnamon oil once, but it didn’t last. I’ve got cinnamon everywhere because I think I live on top of a giant ant hill.

687 2018-01-31 22:41:36 What are we going to put in our cars in lieu of oil? Anxiously awaiting your response.  #NotABot
688 2018-01-31 22:41:35 What's really crazy is we are burning all the oil now which we will need in the future to make pesticides and fertilizers for food production.  Hundreds of millions of people are going to starve in the future because we won't be able to grow enough food.
689 2018-01-31 22:41:34 I heard the bio essence oil is good but that thing is like $30 fr a few MLs :')
690 2018-01-31 22:41:15 Only if other benefits are disregarded. Solar energy will outlast humanity. It won't flood the atmosphere with greenhouse gases. And if it spills, we just get a nice warm day. One more. You can put solar panels on your own roof. Can't do that with oil.
691 2018-01-31 22:41:13 just put coconut oil on my eyelashes, now i see blury... time to sleep!...
692 2018-01-31 22:41:09 There are roughly 7 billion people on this planet.  We need all the energy we can get our hands on.  Overpopulation is the problem, not oil.
693 2018-01-31 22:40:55 U all take $$$ from lobbyists gimme a break....the 2nd Gulf war was over oil& opiates. No disrespect but I welcome your debate
694 2018-01-31 22:40:48 "Bitchy Resting Face," 1984, oil on canvas.
695 2018-01-31 22:40:41 Oil and coal and natural gas  will run out.   Wind and solar is the way to go.  If we wait we fall behind in something else.   That's all Trump has been doing.  Putting us last.  Other countries are moving forward and we're going backwards.  SAD!!
696 2018-01-31 22:40:32 Hi John, I'll enter this year if you ensure the olive oils are tasted in blue glasses so that tasters aren't overly influenced by colour, as professional olive oil tasters do it. Deal?

701 2018-01-31 22:40:17 Today I realized why my mom didn’t want me getting a 2door car, that’s not great on gas, and oil change is expensive

705 2018-01-31 22:40:05 The article is everything but the truth. 
He needs to learn more about the distinction between liquids coming from natural gas wells vs liquids coming from oil wells. 
I posted enough charts to make the point. 
@HFI_Research
706 2018-01-31 22:40:00 So you would prefer to buy oil from nations that oppress people, virtually enslave women, repress dissent amongst it's people just to make a point?? Wow, I hope the rest of citizens of BC aren't as shallow and petty as you appear to be #bcpoli #cdnpoli
707 2018-01-31 22:40:00 I think I'm gonna get some orange oil or something and rub it all over the vents. My house might be a little spicy for a while but that's okay
708 2018-01-31 22:39:53 Live without oil? That's just obviously untrue.
709 2018-01-31 22:39:49 Now Google what can still have, without being derived oil, and get back to her.
710 2018-01-31 22:39:44 There's lots of oil, not all with this steep discount. But WCS is relevant to know what pressures oil sands producers face, so it's very important. Also, these are the two prices reported in the govt budget to guide their royalty forecasts.
711 2018-01-31 22:39:37 They feel confident that the oil will pay for it!!
712 2018-01-31 22:39:28 Am I the only one who remember's the starting "coal and oil revolution" on day one of the presidency? Literally the term that was used.

715 2018-01-31 22:39:15 Former trainee of mine runs a hedge fund betting on oil going up short term
716 2018-01-31 22:39:13 Just a spoonful, if you don't use a bit of oil you get dry ass shit
717 2018-01-31 22:39:12 Waw hot oil ansaya HAHA
718 2018-01-31 22:39:03 PSA: when your daughter is 7 don’t complain to her about rent, oil, work, money. Don’t make her feel like she’s spoiled bc she asks for a toy. Cause then she’s gonna end up like her brother, depressed and always feeling like a burden. Let kids be happy and free from reality!
719 2018-01-31 22:39:02 well my tea tree oil is going in the trash
720 2018-01-31 22:39:00 I apply my beard oil/balm at about 6 am every single day.. my shit is still SOFT and LUSCIOUS when i get off of work 
721 2018-01-31 22:38:59 Mitrovic has been frozen out and not given a chance? What's that all about and how come Darlo has came back from nowhere? Slimani is good buisness he's Gna get goals. We would all love to be owned by Oil rich people but that's not reality.
722 2018-01-31 22:38:58 Time for an oil change my brother. Im retired
723 2018-01-31 22:38:45 Coconut oil out of it -- mistake.
724 2018-01-31 22:38:39 But if we live without oil those who have all the money and power will lose it. Putin learned how to keep his people dependent, allowing him to keep power for decades. Our neophyte oligarchs are chomping at the bit.
Pass the vodka, please
725 2018-01-31 22:38:38 I'm moving there!! Hopefully it'll say forever! I love it, the smell of an old truck diesel or gas engine with shot oil retainers gets fired up, seeing that smoke out of the straight pipe.. it's awesome 
726 2018-01-31 22:38:32 Focussing on the bad for a second, Dave, how does your cheering help us UNDO ethanol, the growing Gulf dead zone and the stripping of SE Asian tropical forests to grow palm oil biofuels?
727 2018-01-31 22:38:26 im trying out a different essential oil that i thought smelled terrible but turns out when heavily diluted in water it smells alright
728 2018-01-31 22:38:16 Fun-Fact 2: Plastic is derived from oil produced by the self-same individuals and corporations. Why else are plastic bags not illegal, but still offered at a cost The the consumer. I mean, they used to let you have the empty boxes. Don’t get me started...
729 2018-01-31 22:38:00 Your a terrible administrator and your connections to oil proves it

732 2018-01-31 22:37:43 The Governor of Indissippi, Inc, Holcomb, has indicated he will extend the moratorium on CBD oil until problems with the new law banning it are fixed. Don't trust the government.  As of 2/1/2018. it will be law in Indissippi, Inc that CBD oil is illegal. You could still be jailed
733 2018-01-31 22:37:35 So @alyssaclopton I’m only 500 miles away from my car having to make a trip to madisonville for an oil change............ 
734 2018-01-31 22:37:33 It's a bloody oil tanker, no fags no booze! Fuck that.
735 2018-01-31 22:37:26 We need to transition from coal to wind/solar/nuclear sooner than later but we're a long LONG way from replacing oil.
736 2018-01-31 22:37:23 Has anybody taken Black Seed Oil before? If so, how were the results?
737 2018-01-31 22:37:20 I tried coconut before but I don’t like putting that on my face  I gotta look into olive oil
738 2018-01-31 22:37:16 The oil wells must have run dry, for a week. Laporte no issue and Mahrez, 60mil to play for 6weeks while Sane is injured. Pep has now spent practically the same on his defence as Jose on all buys.
Just checking, you are still a Liverpool fan, not Citeh?
739 2018-01-31 22:37:13 "Big Oil"…  2 word that are tell of how much you are understanding…  you are get your philosophy from bumper sticker, yes?
740 2018-01-31 22:36:54 Loads of oil everywhere it's the cost of recovery is problem, shale oil creates roof on price currently and when doesn't price will drive move away in record time
741 2018-01-31 22:36:52 if you’re feeling a bit oily grab those paper toilet seat covers. works just as well as oil absorbing sheets @julia_malasig
742 2018-01-31 22:36:51 Hehehe not me  get the baby oil in them they’ll soon slide up
743 2018-01-31 22:36:50 This Admin does not care one bit about future of planet.  Nor do they care that we are falling behind in global efforts to combat climate change.  While other nations are working to develop clean energy, the US is moving backwards, investing in coal and oil.  Such stupidity.
744 2018-01-31 22:36:46 sniff snorf ah yes i love the smell of oil and machines
745 2018-01-31 22:36:43 Also anything in Superdrug Vitamin E range, especially the hot cloth cleanser, Ths Body Shop camomile cleansing balm, Lush Ultrabland and their toner waters or good old coconut oil!
746 2018-01-31 22:36:42 We will be done with oil eventually (~100 years) but if you think we can stop producing it tomorrow you are naive.

757 2018-01-31 22:35:44 i shed a thug tear for my bank account every time i get a synthetic oil change
758 2018-01-31 22:35:33 I don't disagree, but the history is not good. The coast guard was barely able to contain a small leak of fuel oil recently. There is no evidence of a plan, the equipment or the capacity to handle a major spill.  Why is it incumbent on Vancouver to fight for this?
759 2018-01-31 22:35:24 I oppose starting illegal wars after lying about WMD and all the deaths the war caused for oil . Is all about oil and resources . Plenty of uk politicians got their picture taken with Gadaffi and Saddam . Believe me it is all about resources. .
760 2018-01-31 22:35:23 It’s being used to sell snake oil like almost every other so-called invention since about 1997.

778 2018-01-31 22:33:30 Colin perhaps you'd like to forgo all the social programs like health care that oil revenues help to fund, payments to first nations and the like. You're a fool if you think green energy is anything more than a warm and fuzzy for all the welfare bums like you.

820 2018-01-31 22:28:32 It's a human problem (#HiAP #SDoH #primarycare) more than a tech or finance problem. It's a price problem more than a volume problem. There is a lot of useless or harmful snake oil people get stuck paying for. Other than that, they're on the right track.
821 2018-01-31 22:28:23 I don’t blame you! I think it really depends on your skin type. A good cleanser is important for me, preferably oil or a balm (I have quite dry skin). Then an acid a few times a week, to gently peel the skin. Followed by some nice oil for hydration.
822 2018-01-31 22:28:21 I have incredibly dry skin and I use miceller water and cotton to cleanse, and mix Simple moisturizer with a bit of Bio Oil or coconut oil for at night

827 2018-01-31 22:27:53 bottom line tho is that two trade in crude and refined product is quite significant.    Adjusting exports not just imports for oil is increasingly important.
828 2018-01-31 22:27:48 They use the disability formula instead of cumulative earnings, so a 25 year old would likely get less than what they'd expect at retirement. That's separate from the PV=FV issue. But also not obvious, since a 25 y.o who just spend a year making bank in an oil field would max out
829 2018-01-31 22:27:46 Its a shit hole in the middle of nowhere, Thatcher was close to walking away and relocating the 1800 islanders. It was about oil and greed.....

854 2018-01-31 22:25:20 equally odd for the US to export to Canada when Canada is a net exporter --

three things going on here I think:

Suspect Alaska "exports" Alaskan oil to pacific rim, Canadian oil is on the other side of the rockies and flows south (need to confirm)
US imports heavy oil ....
855 2018-01-31 22:25:14 @NancyPelosi I say the Senate should have term limits, that way the old and crusty cam move on with their pockets full of oil and cigarettes.. and the younger generation cam come in and think new mot old

858 2018-01-31 22:25:09 he is not a statesman, but a lying snake oil salesman- unfortunately, there is his base who seem to worship him (always a bad sign), and his party who only want to stay in power, no matter what trump says or does..the worst sign..
859 2018-01-31 22:25:08 Pretty sure the person that slaps baby oil onto Kim K's ass during photo shoots makes more than me. I could be her ass handler.

861 2018-01-31 22:24:36 We have to have something to do after fish and oil :) Do not think Norway will join EU in the near future. My guess is that there will be a ref in 7-10 years and depending economy we might go in or status quo. Do not think we will leave current agreement though....
862 2018-01-31 22:24:35 But Dan wind power is just a lot of hot air and the sun will set on solar power. But big oil and clean coal will never run out. It says so in the bible somewhere. #MAGA

864 2018-01-31 22:24:18 Sounds like a good idea to me Can the lawyers also call for it to be banned (+ visas) from London & purchase of unoccupied property which puts homeless on streets Wait till oil runs out & reason why conversion from oil assets into property & equities #bansaud #BanIslam
865 2018-01-31 22:24:10 Unless you are City, Utd or an oil rich club, you must operate within your means. That said, Ashley has spent 200M in last 3 seasons, inc 55M to assemble a Championship squad. Rafa should be open to criticism as much as he was lauded for winning the Championship!
866 2018-01-31 22:24:10 In this very dry winter weather, I like to coat every sentence of a rough draft in a very thin layer of coconut oil.
867 2018-01-31 22:23:36 Pony up that oil .

870 2018-01-31 22:23:31 there’s no way Trump or anyone close to him did anything that hasn’t been leaked and there’s nothing relevant in these leaks, it’s snake oil nonsense.
871 2018-01-31 22:23:28 Again, oil IS a bonus because other countries don’t have it. It’s great that we do have it. And therefore it’s logical to count it as an essential part of the budget/economy.
872 2018-01-31 22:23:07 Me: Damn I forgot to take my pills this morning

Friend: oh, what pills?

Me: you know, vitamin D, fish oil, cyanide. The necessities.
873 2018-01-31 22:22:55 You go girl! And grab that oil!
874 2018-01-31 22:22:41 Like, sure if it’s cut with other stuff, that could potentially be another toxin or irritant but the problem is the volatile compounds present in the oil itself.
875 2018-01-31 22:22:40 With their piggy, corn oil lubed hands held out for more money.
876 2018-01-31 22:22:25 Why is big bad Man City begging, they have the money for such luxuries, you want our best player mid-season, pony up that oil 
877 2018-01-31 22:22:09 Got it! I sell drugs and move on, I do crap building repairs and move on, I sell snake oil and move on, I do crap gardening and move on, I tell you I am anything and move on. It's called power without responsibility, because we moved on. Can't find us..Aha-aha-ahahahaha. Got it?
878 2018-01-31 22:22:09 Make sure to Do oil change on time lol
879 2018-01-31 22:21:59 When will something be done about petrojam and their pricing mechanism? Can't catch a break even when world oil prices are going down
880 2018-01-31 22:21:54 It's hard to have a single shred of sympathy when
A) your players also make poor challenges even when they're playing so much better than everyone else  and,
B) you're going to spunk £65m more oil money on another flighty winger.
881 2018-01-31 22:21:48 Yup, I thought he should boss this as with all due respect to Niko it’s his  fitness level . However, he was still poor against  a team of oil rig workers.  He’s finished, not that he really started with us anyway , just a few glimpses of quality  here and there.
882 2018-01-31 22:21:46 Well, scottish oil no doubt? Besides not the way forward, it is investing in green energy. Fossil fuels behind climate change, and world pollution.  Biggest killer out there. Stop UK of wanting to kill the world. BP is satans spawn.
883 2018-01-31 22:21:39 Haha I just got rid of my Bimmer. Oil changes were $100+ and everything slowly started breaking and I spent like $3000 on repairs in the last 2 years :(

895 2018-01-31 22:20:12 My biggest takeaway after using Hello Fresh for 3 months, the insane amount of olive oil I’ve gone thru.
896 2018-01-31 22:20:11 @RepJoeKennedy Also it is inane merit less and ridiculous  argument to say non investors do not reap countless benefits from Wall Street investors.  Commuter that drives 12 k a years saves 9 thousands in fuel costs do to oil and gas investment there's 1000s of other examples

913 2018-01-31 22:17:38 Worse than that, it also contains palmitine. This is often derived from palm oil for which rainforests are cut down. Please ask the manufacturer if it is from a verifiable good source.

919 2018-01-31 22:16:56 Thanks for the link, will read. Oil is a bonus, and it also is an essential part of funding. It’s an essential part because it’s already there. It’s a bonus because many countries don’t have any and do far better than the UK. I’ve always thought it so, long before 2014.

927 2018-01-31 22:16:07 Thank you for posting this. I've never really understand what kind of oil we have in Alberta and I've never known whether be happy when the price of WTI goes up or if there's another "blend" I should be watching. Looks like it was the latter.

948 2018-01-31 22:13:50 Have you ever even seen the Canadian Pacific Ocean?  Do you understand how delicate this eco system is? Do you understand how permanent an oil spill is? Go look at Exxon Valdez site almost 30 years later. Raw Oil is still on the beach and void of life just like it was left.

989 2018-01-31 22:09:07 Trouble with all these places - and just read the food descriptions in the article - is that the food is rather unhealthy. Deep fried or cooked in a lot of oil or smothered in cheeses (3).  Us "healthy" vegans want the good stuff to.

You can divest from oil (or anything else) without much consequence, says Jeremy Grantham at #InvestorSummit2018
993 2018-01-31 22:08:43 Tea tree CAN have topical applications but only if extremely diluted. At my practice we generally advise against it because of the margin of error, and potential for ingestion. Some essential oils are safe for pets but it is not due to their purity, it is due to WHICH oil it is.
994 2018-01-31 22:08:40 What does energy independence mean to you? Just oil related? No imports at all or just net exports exceeding imports? Energy ind. should include a lot more than oil so cite your sources and show your math.
995 2018-01-31 22:08:24 Just had me my last tuna and avocado on sourdough bread foot long with mayo, mustard, lettuce tomato, spinach, onions, peppers cheddar cheese, salt, pepper, and vinegar and oil at this Subway that's closing down.
996 2018-01-31 22:08:17 Avon skin so soft body oil. Best repellent ever. And no-I am not joking!
997 2018-01-31 22:08:17 like a day and a half i just scrubbed it with baby oil
998 2018-01-31 22:08:16 I love BC with all my heart, but their constant objections and political roadblocks to Alberta's oil industry are infuriating. I wonder if they're prepared for Alberta to play dirty politics in the same manner? It feels like a showdown is unnecessarily imminent.
999 2018-01-31 22:08:03 Tradition and they are supposed to spray her, with what exactly? Palm wine or red oil?
1000 2018-01-31 22:07:56 So the beautiful part about oil is that it works with literally any skin type. So if your skin is oily already, it reduces the amount of oil your skin produces, which is why it makes for the perfect moisturizer.
1001 2018-01-31 22:07:56 What on an oil tanker?
1002 2018-01-31 22:07:49 I don't get it, it's January and Man City come begging with hat in hand hoping for a good deal while there player is hurt, And I can see how mahrez would be depressed it's nice to go to the top team in the league.
Man City should man up that oil .
1003 2018-01-31 22:07:45 I'm the oil guy. I'm borderline obsessive about fluid/filter changes.
1004 2018-01-31 22:07:40 Tea tree oil has always been bad , even for adults if u excessively use it . Can also cause dried skin so why wouldn't it be bad on animals
1005 2018-01-31 22:07:37 Well, the Norwegian oil and gas fields which have been yielding the main profits the last 30 years are mostly farther north.
1006 2018-01-31 22:07:36 What are you using to bind it  oil?
1007 2018-01-31 22:07:25 Okay take them but crush them up and put them in your conditioner as well. And take prenatal vitamins too. Also use the same products and even add tea tree and or hemp oil to your routine
1008 2018-01-31 22:07:19 Waiting for my oil change to get done, I’ve probably every facial expression possible 
1009 2018-01-31 22:07:13 Shit box Toyota.
1010 2018-01-31 22:07:09 Awesome to verify moneylaundering  #Cult45 @GOP   are now 100% facing #ObstructionOfJustice w/their coverup  There is no doubt. Lol using the  criminal Putin playbook  ...  all the way. #Sanctions #oil $$$  #WorseThanWatergate @DevinNunes @SpeakerRyan ~ @FBI :) #Titanic
1011 2018-01-31 22:07:03 you can never go wrong with chips. go for the kettle cooked in avocado oil. pretty sure they're healthier than actual salad. 
1012 2018-01-31 22:07:03 lrt gotta be more careful where i use  ylang ylang oil at my house :/
1013 2018-01-31 22:06:48 It is incredible how many American "progressives" are fawning all over Joe Kennedy today completely unaware that when it comes to pot prohibition he is lockstep with Jeff Sessions and wants to lock up kids using CBD oil to treat their illnesses.
1014 2018-01-31 22:06:45 It’s not just tea tree that is a problem; eucalyptus oil, cinnamon oil, citrus oils and more are toxic to animals. The greater the purity, the more toxic it is. It doesn’t matter if the poison is cheap or expensive, it is still poison.
1015 2018-01-31 22:06:40 This steamed fish with chili oil, chili sauce and soy sauce is bomb
1016 2018-01-31 22:06:16 He's got high hopes of sanction free Russian oil,and Exxon to bring it over,right Rex?
1017 2018-01-31 22:06:09 The way Man U and Chelsea are going down they'll soon discover oil and bits and pieces of Arsenal, oh wait they've found bits of Arsenal in Giroud and Sanchez
1018 2018-01-31 22:05:58 I grew up in a military family. I support the military. But we are in danger of becoming a mercenary nation. Have missiles; will travel....if you have oil.
1019 2018-01-31 22:05:53 Pres Trump is expanding offshore drilling to support the petro dollar in the world. All the middle east is a fight over the oil fields. Also provides more USA revenue and jobs.
1020 2018-01-31 22:05:49 うーん、そういうわけでもないような……
どういう状態かはなんとなくわかってるし、人にその状態を話そうと思えば簡単にまとめられるはずなのに、今も頭の中がごちゃごちゃしちゃって上手く説明できない。
1021 2018-01-31 22:05:46 I always feel so adult when I go to get my oil changed 
1022 2018-01-31 22:05:45 When I started realizing how many jobs and money in general would be lost if we started using alternative power to replace oils and gas, I started rooting for oil/gas.
1023 2018-01-31 22:05:33 It’s time for the Democrats to get proactive. They should hold daily meetings and talk about why the sanction Bill cannot get past. The money from that oil will be used for missiles to be pointed at the US or something as ominous
1024 2018-01-31 22:05:33 Mmm, must be trolling as there is no internationally recognised way how the majority of N Sea oil could belong to England. UK yip, Scotland on indy yip.
1025 2018-01-31 22:05:29 United fans yesterday:

"Pep's buying the league !11!!, Oil Money"

United fans today:

"Young OUT, Valencia OUT, Mourinho should've bought someone !!11! "
1026 2018-01-31 22:05:23 To think I Stil used this lightening oil tonight 
1027 2018-01-31 22:05:20 Various people have debunked GERS, others think it accurate. I actually don’t know. What I do know is an independent country can set its own rules, its own taxes on things like oil (whether raising or lowering them) to best suit its economy. That’s what Scotland deserves.
1028 2018-01-31 22:05:08 Got ma nails done, breathalyzer recalibrated, car wash/oil changed. Hopefully put my first month and deposit down on a place later. And after all that still stacked, Miley wus good
1029 2018-01-31 22:05:06 The way Man U and Chelsea are going down they'll soon discover oil and bits and pieces of Arsenal, oh wait they've found bits of Arsenal in Giroud and Sanchez.
1030 2018-01-31 22:04:52 Obama deported more immigrants than trump... 

Oil will eventually die because you see it runs out...

And obama took steps in the right direction for healthcare but still incorrect.

But what you did there is called whataboutism because you cannot answer my question.
1031 2018-01-31 22:04:52 erdogan's regime was buying isis stolen oil, giving free transit to fighters and weapons... many credible sources to back this up... At the same time, The Kurds were heroically fighting isis... It's erdogan's regime that is the terrorists here, not the Kurds...
1032 2018-01-31 22:04:32 Because the crude oil is not from the Niger delta but from Niger republic.
1033 2018-01-31 22:04:32 Much like all the coal and oil between China and North Korea. For something not so important to us others badly want
1034 2018-01-31 22:04:14 After forgetting for 5+ weeks I’m finally stopping by Kroger to get vegetable oil.  There’re a couple other things I know I need but i haven’t a clue at this moment

1042 2018-01-31 22:03:44 The world wil still need materials made from oil though such as plastics.
1043 2018-01-31 22:03:38 What of oil roads?
1044 2018-01-31 22:03:34 $20 on oil money!
1045 2018-01-31 22:03:26 Fellani just came into the match to share anointing oil then went back to the dressing room   
1046 2018-01-31 22:03:23 Well not in mood to debate!
Oil money ain’t going anywhere 
We are getting back where we belong sooner than you think

1051 2018-01-31 22:02:46 Trump and Tillerson still trying to salvage that $500billion Russian oil deal. Create a demand by shutting down alternative sources.
1052 2018-01-31 22:02:39 Exfoliating and vitamin E oil really helps me.
1053 2018-01-31 22:02:38 cuz coconut oil is LIFE KAYLA
1054 2018-01-31 22:02:31 man whats so bad about avacado toast? my HDL is low on account of being sober with no hormones. I eat it like 4 times a week. Got this kimchi furikake I throw on there with some sesame oil it's delicious

1056 2018-01-31 22:02:28 VICKS Vaporub, VICKS Nasal stock and Olbas oil are a nursery nurses best friend! #vicks #olbasoil #nurserynurselife #fluprevention
1057 2018-01-31 22:02:22 I can tell you what Obama did for me. He cut off the oil field from drilling and I lost my job, my mom was in chemo and he signed a bill that out my mom in the grave to stop funding research. He allowed 100’s of thousands of immigrants to cross our border and killed people I knew
1058 2018-01-31 22:02:21 Better than that team searching for oil..
1059 2018-01-31 22:01:56 Electric or autonomous ? Surely q1 has to be about the immediacy if moving away from reliance on oil - then we can move on from there
1060 2018-01-31 22:01:55 In November, Citgo used lowest amount of Venezuelan oil in at least 15 yrs. @lkassai does the math from @EIAgov data. More on @TheTerminal
1061 2018-01-31 22:01:51 Okay babes hmu with every vegetarian recipe you have. Also what oil ratio does ur mum use I’m gonna make the coconut oil/ghee a permanent thing for me
1062 2018-01-31 22:01:36 In no particular order:

1.  Coal.  "Beautiful clean coal".  

2.  Oil.  Specifically Rosneft.  Russia's biggest export and source of trade $.

3.  Obama encouraged clean energy.
1063 2018-01-31 22:01:29 Well because you ran out of oil money. 
Wait for a season more and you will return to sound like Chelsea from the 90s.
1064 2018-01-31 22:01:27 Your kids kids will surely enjoy the national parks when oil rigs and pipes are running through them and you can only see 15% of the land compared to now.
1065 2018-01-31 22:01:21 They aren't "burdensome". They are there to ensure we have clean air/water now and in the future. The only thing you care about is the $$$ the coal and oil people are paying you.

1068 2018-01-31 22:01:15 いい流れが来てるかもしれないですね…
1069 2018-01-31 22:01:14 Which is more cleaner...  Running coal/oil/gas power plants 100% of the time.  Or Running gas plants (which can be fired up faster then coal/oil plants) some of the time?  You also subsidize coal mines, oil industry, gas industry.  The subsidies to renewable power is much smaller
1070 2018-01-31 22:01:13 To heal a pimple quickly, apply tea tree oil on pimple every few hours, and apply vitamin E oil on the spot, about 1 hour before bedtime.
1071 2018-01-31 22:01:12 Es urgente una rebaja del gas oil. No se aguanta más ir a cargar combustible.
1072 2018-01-31 22:01:12 Gap may expand again in time as all of the regulations pertaining to safety and the environment, not to mention where companies can drill, are being removed in the US. Making it cheaper (and more hazardous) to produce oil at home. $WTIC should dip in price mid-LT unless $ falls.
1073 2018-01-31 22:01:06 イケメン…
1074 2018-01-31 22:01:01 RT @LivingSafely: Ritz Original Crackers this February? Its top four ingredients are flour, soybean oil, sugar and cottonseed oil.
1075 2018-01-31 22:00:56 Stop with this goofy idea that stopping new pipelines means no oil. We want to move away from oil. Use the infrastructure in place and Only invest in new clean energy to facilitate a 10-20 yr shift. Why invest in a dying industry?! No more pipelines! Use what we have and convert.
1076 2018-01-31 22:00:44 Coconut oil really is the  to pretty much everything
1077 2018-01-31 22:00:38 January 31, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
1078 2018-01-31 22:00:37 Worst case scenario is that BTC is used by countries to purchase oil and buy individuals to purchase boats, houses, expensive clothes, plane tickets, etc. Movie tix you would buy with another currency. BTC would have an AmEx black reputation. Thus I believe BTC is here to stay
1079 2018-01-31 22:00:36 OIL DIFF: 4.39 -> 4.42
1080 2018-01-31 22:00:27 They contain palm oil - it’s use causes deforestation, habitat degradation, climate change, animal cruelty and indigenous rights abuses in the countries where it is produced, as the land and forests must be cleared for the development of the oil palm plantations. Great cake FFS

1085 2018-01-31 22:00:10 ...spend a day in my house and watch my son have 30-50 seizures A DAY. Tell me that he has to stop using a natural oil that reduces his seizures to ZERO a day. Tell me that he has to keep taking the expensive shit that his body can’t break down...
1086 2018-01-31 22:00:05 GOOD FATS: Avocado, Fish, Almonds, Walnuts, Peanuts, Cashews, Olive Oil, Coconut Oil, Seeds, Coconut, Olives, Peanut Butter, Low-Fat Dairy
1087 2018-01-31 21:59:59 It was a cake mix  I can usually make cakes but it's been years. Wanted to make it vegan so used some fizzy flavoured water as an egg replacement and i think that made it too sweet but I put too much in and way too much oil which fucked the texture.
1088 2018-01-31 21:59:35 Dear Art, looking forward to listening your upcoming interview on macro vision this weekend.Just a quick question: what is the  most overwhelming factor this time around which you identify to support the view this oil rally is a long term bull trend not a short head rally?Thanks.
1089 2018-01-31 21:59:06 Coconut oil is my favorite to cook with 
1090 2018-01-31 21:58:54 Our oil is more expensive because it is harder to extract. Low oil prices is the problem - not taxes, or the NDP

1093 2018-01-31 21:58:22 Every week on here I see new vehicles, commercial and private that are electric or fuel cell powered. Yet here we are with oil or fracking. All yesterday's tech.

1094 2018-01-31 21:58:16 Lmao oh no ma’am. Just use it as your moisturizer and you should see some fading in about a month. Marula oil is also great too. That’s what I’m about to switch to for my moisturizer.

1101 2018-01-31 21:57:35 I regret that this salad was restaurant-borne and I'm not exactly up to cooking my own. But I do keep thinking of doing a basic "cut up some sprouts, dust w/ some oil & spices & throw in toaster oven" attempt sometime…
1102 2018-01-31 21:57:07 The left wing idealists took to the streets, but it was Prague that was overthrown. Bound to make a person a tad cynical. No wonder Schröder sold out to Russian oil.

1108 2018-01-31 21:56:44 Then why has gas gone up 10 cents in a day? Oil Co's trying to make up bonuses in a hurry?

1124 2018-01-31 21:55:34 So what’s happened to Nigeria’s oil! Has it run dry? Oh don’t we have a need to “build” one refinery inside Nigeria instead of its borders! Is there something I’m missing here?
1125 2018-01-31 21:55:30 Can't wait till this oil outta me I'm pissin like a race horse 
1126 2018-01-31 21:55:28 i had to use olive oil to get my mascara off it was weird
1127 2018-01-31 21:55:27 Psssh, You know he uses Whale Oil. Makes him more aerodynamic xD
1128 2018-01-31 21:55:18 Oh okay I got you, everyone's saying oil first. Defo going to do this thanks Hun xx
1129 2018-01-31 21:55:11 Se va estabilizando la tasa, el oil reconoció la ema(20) como soporte luego del gran built que hubo de inventarios recuperando los 64, vix en descenso, futuros en usa van positivo, creo que sigue up el $merval para mañana. Como siempre la súper dovish Yellen nos dio la mano.
1130 2018-01-31 21:55:03 MY MRS'S FIRST TIME ON EVER SHOWN PHIL JONES FACE ? SHE SAID IF SHE HAD TO WAKE UP EVERY MORNING WITH THAT FACE ? SHE WOULD HOPE SHE'D ONLY GET P.T.S.T ?

1131 2018-01-31 21:54:55 Gun Oil is best.  FWIW.
1132 2018-01-31 21:54:54 peppermint oil helps a lot, if you have any
1133 2018-01-31 21:54:54 I bought mine from Walmart, i did research on which oil benefits for your health. I got lavender & rose, to help sleep and with anxiety. But thank you for letting me know!
1134 2018-01-31 21:54:50 I see the big @Lucas_Oil decal!!!!
#awesome

1136 2018-01-31 21:54:33 Extra virgin #olive #oil provides deep moisture in your #face and works as a shield to protect face skin.  Massage olive oil gently into your face, to promote elasticity!
1137 2018-01-31 21:54:23 Joe Marushack of @COP_Alaska echoes same sentiment from his presentation at #MeetAlaska18 - keep tax structure the same in order for #oil companies to continue contributing to Alaska’s economy.
1138 2018-01-31 21:54:14 Such a burden, this oil. Thank God we have the broad shoulders of the Union to cope with it.
1139 2018-01-31 21:54:06 no he didn't he said oil barrell to start with because some do call it that.
1140 2018-01-31 21:54:00 What BC should  do is ensure all the resources are in place to minimize the risk of any spill and most effectively contain and clean up should a spill occur; what it shouldn't do is prevent Alta from maximizing the value of its oil and diversifying its markets @bcpoli @ableg
1141 2018-01-31 21:53:57 Nunes fabricated a memo based on invented claims, no evidence.

But FISA relates to Carter Page caught on SIGINT negotiating a quid pro quo to deliver Trump support to Russia in exchange for 19.5% of a subsidiary of an oil & Gas co in Russia.

That is treason. Nunes would hide it
1142 2018-01-31 21:53:51 I have learnt to never change my oil at Walmart again because those guys told me my battery was okay. Wow.
1143 2018-01-31 21:53:47 Peak me is looking up essential oil recipes for concentration while procrastinating on a story.
1144 2018-01-31 21:53:37 sometimes i feel that the greatest exporter of american oil is my greasy-ass face
1145 2018-01-31 21:53:37 She should back off.. because Mr. Premier of BC is protecting BC-ers. We have a right to being protected from your dirty industry. Find a new way to make $, oil isnt going to run forever. Get out of our province.
1146 2018-01-31 21:53:29 Anyone surprised snake oil salesmen O'Leary is scheming on coin offerings?
1147 2018-01-31 21:53:28 I need my oil changed. I need my car washed. I need new tires. & I’ve just been turning up the music & ignoring all these issues 
1148 2018-01-31 21:53:08 I know he does. I have been to his IG but I go nuts when I see all his fans saying what a wonderful dad he is. They defend him to the end. I think they blame our girl for the divorce. Not sure why I dislike him so much but he is like a slimy guy smelling snake oil medicine lol.
1149 2018-01-31 21:52:35 Anti-progress Republicans want the US to return to the 1980s. Living dinosaurs, unable to adapt. #RenewableEnergy

Lets increase pollution, oil spills and ashma rates, yay!

1151 2018-01-31 21:52:29 Why would @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP @HOuseGOP even be thinking about this? Ar they all stock holders & campaign beneficiaries of fossil fuels? There are 10s of thousands of high paying long term jobs in sustainable clean energy sector- many more than coal, gas and oil.
1152 2018-01-31 21:52:05 why am I having this feel where arthur has a connection with the oil rig in man of steel? #Aquaman

1155 2018-01-31 21:51:42 At 8? Holy crap. I read Jules Verne & Arthur Conan Doyle & Narnia around that age, but "Dune" would have been too convoluted and strange. I saw the Lynch film adaptation at 12 and I loved it, even though parts freaked me out (heart-plug, oil bath). Finally read the book at 18. —B
1156 2018-01-31 21:51:36 Bringing back whale oil for heat? #TrumpSucks

1159 2018-01-31 21:51:19 THANK YOU BC GOVERNMENT for protecting Canadians FROM DIRTY NOTLEY. This country isnt ALL about Alberta Oil. Some of us prefer long term solutions and industries. GET OUT OF BC.

1163 2018-01-31 21:51:08 If by "ping-pong" you mean dioramas and oil paintings, game on!
1164 2018-01-31 21:50:58 Send him to us then  I'll tak that russian oil money
1165 2018-01-31 21:50:57 So-called president Trump has sold the environment to the oil companies and the polluters of this country and you are assisting in this sell out. I hope you don’t have any children because you will be leaving them a dirty or more polluted more toxic world.
1166 2018-01-31 21:50:52 Got an oil change and cut off 4 inches of hair 
1167 2018-01-31 21:50:51 So you're giving an example of a country with oil wealth that is letting people die of hunger... and you say that's an example of socialism because...? And is this to imply that people in the US don't die of hunger? As for why I don't move there: because I'm not Venezuelan.
1168 2018-01-31 21:50:48 Y’all hoes be puttin oil on ya face then be like I’m glowin  knowin danm well y’all face dry dry any other time

1171 2018-01-31 21:50:28 A man isn't paying attention crossing the street and is hit by a delivery truck carrying boxes of Omega 3 pills. He's taken to hospital where his family shows up frantic. They confront the doctor who tells them "Don't worry it's only a super fish oil injury"
1172 2018-01-31 21:50:22 1. Quote: "Scotland’s economic output per head, even without oil and gas, is virtually the same as the UK as a whole. So oil and gas is a bonus".
There's a whole chapter on the economy, an annexe, and numerous references to spending throughout the 670 pages.
1173 2018-01-31 21:50:21 The coconut oil on my hands will repair the cracks in my screen, right?
1174 2018-01-31 21:50:19 Because oil stocks will only go up... and selling now makes less money for the fund.
1175 2018-01-31 21:50:02 #PassOnPlastic #skypapers everybody had burnt is match #oil used as much #plastic as #princercharles the world would have ended 20 years ago
1176 2018-01-31 21:50:00 I've been hearing so much stuff about essential oils in oil diffusers being toxic to animals. If you have pets and use a diffuser please check that the kinds you have are safe!
1177 2018-01-31 21:49:49 Brought my truck in to Scottsdale to get an oil change. I’ve never really spent any time here, but is a very pretty town. Of course, it’s 81 here now & not 140, so that helps.
1178 2018-01-31 21:49:41 The open door policy also doesn't fly for: vehicle, oil and gas, or really any other industrial scale production facility- but you don't complain there? 
The industry is inherently humane. Grandin also followed that statement up with "animals are immediately re-stunned"
1179 2018-01-31 21:49:34 Oil from the oil sands runs Vancouver, hopefully Notley will get a spine and we can show you how much you need Alberta oil.
1180 2018-01-31 21:49:33 ion think britney got the oil all ove rmy scalp cause my shit thumping
1181 2018-01-31 21:49:20 That’s actually a good idea! I’m just really used to the consistency of the clinique balm, so I’m bias  It’s exactly like coconut oil’s which I LOVE but coconut oil’s soooo bad for your skin

Should be great news if you like higher oil and gas prices...!

(In what way is conserving energy not conservative, again??!)
1186 2018-01-31 21:48:38 Oh man thank you for sharing this info. Used to use an oil diffuser with tea tree oil. My pupper and I don't live in that house anymore but this is good info for any pet parent to have!
1187 2018-01-31 21:48:37 Largest proven oil reserves in the world. Wonder what the market cap will be.

1190 2018-01-31 21:48:32 This should be mentioned more often in the context of America losing global influence. With increasing LNG and crude oil exports there will be at least one more lever for US soft power.
1191 2018-01-31 21:47:59 @AEDCweb Conoco reporting that the shale revolution in the lower 48 is a big competitor and threat to AK oil production.
1192 2018-01-31 21:47:57 @MSNBC @NicolleDWallace @maddow 
Why Trump and Russia? Money and oil.
No sanctions means Exxon oil deal goes through. Explains Tillerson. I bet Putin told Trump he would get a cut if sanctions were removed. Trump makes BILLIONS.

1194 2018-01-31 21:47:45 But Venezuelan’s dictador Maduro is coming out with a Crypto currency LMAO... He can’t handle the economy of a very small country with the largest reserve of oil in the world but he expects the World to invest in his scam....

1205 2018-01-31 21:46:52 Yes sir
1206 2018-01-31 21:46:45 Pretty sure my blood type is frying oil.
1207 2018-01-31 21:46:44 Except, they're not, Because Destiny 2 has kept the oil fire burning. If EA think they're gonna get an easier time now, they are sorely mistaken.
1208 2018-01-31 21:46:41 Excited to incorporate jojoba and organic rose hip oil into my beauty regime 
1209 2018-01-31 21:46:40 So much for the oil industry creating new jobs. Time to acknowledge it’s a slowly dying industry, no more new pipelines.
1210 2018-01-31 21:46:29 No, the toxicity has nothing to do with the purity of the oil. The oil itself is the problem; cats and dogs lack the necessary enzymes to break down certain oils when inhaled, so they build up in the body, to detrimental effect.
1211 2018-01-31 21:46:19 fuck I didn’t buy vegetable oil 
1212 2018-01-31 21:46:11 I love the waitrose pure facial oil, hot cloth cleanser and moisturiser. All 3 for less than £12 and just as good as eve lom.
1213 2018-01-31 21:46:04 XLE/OIL RSI back oversold. Certainly alot of excitement today over nothing. Essentially a flat day all around
1214 2018-01-31 21:46:01 Well reactions are variable to the individual. You can't really say that MCT oil would suppress appetite in all people. I would try it though. The effects of MCT oil are so strong it rises the amount of carbohydrates you can eat while remaining in Ketosis. Plus it's exothermic.
1215 2018-01-31 21:46:00 Bush started a war over oil, ran us into a recession and couldnt barely read off a propter, but Obama was on a crime spree.
1216 2018-01-31 21:45:56 Oil based lubricants friend or foe? You be the judge
1217 2018-01-31 21:45:53 They look lovely, but knowing M&S their dressing is likely to be white wine vinegar and a little bit of oil. Maybe a little soy sauce, if you're lucky.

1219 2018-01-31 21:45:26 body wanted to know that Tahini sauce is not the same as sesame oil based hummus designs on chickpeas from Bellacheck.
1220 2018-01-31 21:45:21 Such a change would go along way in explaining the US' sudden desire to export so much oil, no?
1221 2018-01-31 21:45:21 Walmart if you talmbout oil lol
1222 2018-01-31 21:45:18 Son that is funny af!! Like I'm imagining walking in to pick up one of the kids and they throwing holy oil at each other

1224 2018-01-31 21:45:07 Seven-minute Silva. Sounds like an oil change service.
1225 2018-01-31 21:44:55 Only on an oil rig you get 30 ft joints, buckets of dope and trip all day
1226 2018-01-31 21:44:49 Got a beautiful planet. But we are just fucking it up with fuel oil poison pills money badmusic no respect for true* women no love for the ocean the trees the food the water!!!!!
1227 2018-01-31 21:44:41 The ocean is a viable source of uranium, but breeder reactors turn any rock into a source of nuclear fuel. A cubic meter of common granite contains 80 times the energy of a cubic meter of oil.
1228 2018-01-31 21:44:34 El tea tree oil es excelente para limpiar las impurezas de la cara
1229 2018-01-31 21:44:30 @AEDCweb Conoco reporting four major oil projects in the pipeline. No pun intended. There are also 5 exploration well projects scheduled.
1230 2018-01-31 21:44:24 The refinery will use Niger's oil
1231 2018-01-31 21:44:17 Why does it take dealerships an hour to do oil changes?? #BellLetsTalk
1232 2018-01-31 21:44:03 U can cook bacon without oil but certainly cant do it without gas fuck
1233 2018-01-31 21:43:52 Can someone please give me a site to buy not shitty factory made African Black Soap and Jamaican Castor Oil 
1234 2018-01-31 21:43:52 Niger already drills oil in commercial quantity.
1235 2018-01-31 21:43:45 At what cost, should we expect another  Love Cannel or BP oil spill on anyone of our coasts
1236 2018-01-31 21:43:36 Crude oil inventory build up and weaker USD hence the price drop. Maybe #trumps SOU speech will trigger markets higher after investors take some profits of the table.

1239 2018-01-31 21:43:15 I worked at @pizzahut for a month and all I got was an eighth, an oil change and a half-tank of gas. Burn in hell, you dirty fucks.
1240 2018-01-31 21:43:15 If the people were truly in charge you, asshole, wouldn't be selling our national parks and public lands to oil companies. You also wouldn't allow @DowChemical to continue spraying nerve gas on our food but ya know it's cool. Keep pushing your farce, I can't wait to see in orange
1241 2018-01-31 21:42:57 The Palm Beach Post reports that Trump Realty is expanding its operations in southern Florida. (h/t @jonathanchait ). Hmm...makes one wonder whether that had anything to do with Trump's decision to drop Florida from his offshore oil drilling plan
1242 2018-01-31 21:42:50 The scar should become far less visible over time: moroccan argan oil is great for reducing swelling and promoting recovery.  It works on us, as well!
1243 2018-01-31 21:42:46 I just have the actual oil not a diffuser
1244 2018-01-31 21:42:39 I go back and fourth all the time lol it's like a 4 month gap for each for me lol sometimes oil just don't do the trick when I have been dabbing a lot
1245 2018-01-31 21:42:34 YES I love the tingle, I dilute it with coconut oil
1246 2018-01-31 21:42:25 Opened boot of my car today and found garage had left the bottle of remaining oil from service.  Never had that before
1247 2018-01-31 21:42:19 dude bro i swear bro dude inhaling that toxic manufactured hot oil is bad for you man who would have thought?????
1248 2018-01-31 21:42:18 @AEDCweb Joe Marushack/Conoco kicking it off saying that ALL Alaskans are in the oil industry. For every oil job, 22 other jobs are created.

1250 2018-01-31 21:42:10 When my cousin and her husband argue, they start throwing holy oil all over the house. Remotes, cell phones, the kids, everything lol
1251 2018-01-31 21:42:07 when i first saw a cel of rugged rodent i thought filmation was actually trying to make a villain that wasnt oil can harry

1252 2018-01-31 21:42:07 Anyways i failed at adulting today. i was supposed to get an oil change but instead i got jersey mikes and a pedicure. I have 1% engine oil life...
1253 2018-01-31 21:42:05 Why did your car need a oil change
1254 2018-01-31 21:41:48 If you don’t mind me asking did you just have to take the oils away and your animals got better. This seems exactly like what’s going on with my dog. Didn’t even think about the tea tree oil ive been using and i think she might have licked some off of the ground are i used it.
1255 2018-01-31 21:41:18 @Dean Heller

1259 2018-01-31 21:40:59 Bc they actually make little to no money on the oil change and use it as the first step in their value ladder to sell you services that have extremely high margins.

1266 2018-01-31 21:40:05 Yeah might be possible, probably not worth the effort.

1290 2018-01-31 21:37:08 why is a cartel or price fixing bad for bread but ok for oil?
1291 2018-01-31 21:36:50 most oil comes from one-celled plants and animals, eg plankton.
1292 2018-01-31 21:36:42 Maybe since you get acne from stress I would just look into products with soothing ingredients like lavender, oatmeal, grapeseed oil, etc. Although it may be in Japanese, usually products with soothing ingredients will have sort of design in purple or, well, a soothing look to it
1293 2018-01-31 21:36:39 I cleanse with coconut oil, then wash with Clinique foaming cleanser before using a night serum. I also exfoliate twice a week and forget to take my make up off when drunk.
1294 2018-01-31 21:36:38 The simple range is good. Plus I alway use baby oil to take off eye make up even water proof. It means you don’t drag the eye area. I still don’t have wrinkles around my eyes and I’m in my late 40’s. Very cheap too.
1295 2018-01-31 21:36:36 Baby oil!
1296 2018-01-31 21:36:35 Obviously oil and gas is not eco, it's extraction, process and distribution is decimating the planet. Wood fuel is a low carbon locally sourced renewable alternative that promotes planting trees. Look at the evolution of fireplaces in the UK over 500 years, we've come a long way!
1297 2018-01-31 21:36:30 This girl was using linseed oil to paint with oils instead of paint thinner or mineral spirits. Its fun to watch oil amateurs
1298 2018-01-31 21:36:29 I spent 7 hours at work on my day off reading a book and drinking free coffee while waiting for an oil change.

1300 2018-01-31 21:36:23 If that is the case, you need to tell Trump. They are subsidizing nuclear energy, oil, gas and coal. Until THOSE subsidies stop, clean energy subsidies should not only surpass them but continue.
1301 2018-01-31 21:36:07 Every time I get my oil changed O boy be flirting. I need @Beard_KW to start dropping me off at work and taking my car.
1302 2018-01-31 21:36:06 All this fuckery so we can build a big soulless concrete bowl full of tourists. It’ll be worth it in 2030 when all the oil runs dry.

1307 2018-01-31 21:35:31 Use patchouli oil to rid acne. Mix ten drops of that with ten ounces of almond oil as a nightly moisturizer and anti-wrinkle treatment.
1308 2018-01-31 21:35:18 Yes, essential oils can trigger disabling symptoms for some people, but lemon oil and vinegar for instance is a step up from windex. EOs are a very broad category.

Check and change the oil. No single step will help an engine last more than regular oil and filter changes will. Conversely, nothing will destroy an engine faster than neglecting oil-level checks or fresh-oil changes.

1391 2018-01-31 21:27:05 I admit to being a rank amateur Charlie regarding these things. A quick follow up. How about pumping more oil that leads 2 lowering the gas prices, & then put a .25 or .50 Federal Debt tax on a gallon?  That coupled with the end of Baseline Budgeting has 2 B trillions of dollars.

1412 2018-01-31 21:25:06 Oil and water are immiscible.
1413 2018-01-31 21:24:59 One of the problems is the remittances sent to Mexico from the US is larger than revenues generated by the state run oil business.  Maybe the multiple billions of dollars should stay in this country?

1429 2018-01-31 21:23:03 Corsi believes there’s a vast conspiracy to keep us from a limitless supply of cheap oil being created by bacteria at the bottom of the ocean. A Facebook friend credulously sent me a link to his claim back in 2010. That’s when I realized how bad the US electorate is.

1439 2018-01-31 21:20:45 Unfortunately, according to Quebec's #SankeyDiagram, crude oil and natural gas are still accounting for over 90% of fuel used for transportation. As the professor mentioned, coal is on the decrease even as we use more power overall. #EnergyEarth #Lesson4 #NonRenewableEnergy

1449 2018-01-31 21:19:17 Florida House adopts HB 319 resolution. It would extend the current moratorium on oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico east of the Military Mission Line.

The resolution is not enforceable, just expresses the will of the Legislature.

1451 2018-01-31 21:19:10 On the narrow issue of Scotland’s oil, the point is that WM has consistently demonstrated that it catastrophically fails to manage the resource properly for the benefit of all. The only way to change that is for those who are closest to the issue to manage it - e.g. in Scotland.
1452 2018-01-31 21:18:48 And his approval rating went up.  Why.  Because he is a snake oil salesman and his base and other gullible people buy his lies.  #LiarinChief #DunceTrump #TraitorTrump #ImposeRussianSanctions #TrumpCrimeFamily

1453 2018-01-31 21:18:45 You have tolls because R governors won't tax oil company's that tear up the roads.

1455 2018-01-31 21:18:18 @ChrisGPackham Hi Chris, as someone who has visited Indonesia over 20 times and most likely the first to raise awareness of the oil palm plantations effect on wildlife and people, I want to congratulate you on an excellent film. Told and shown with emotion, integrity and honesty
1456 2018-01-31 21:18:18 What do you think the cashier asked when I went to the check out with a plastic shower curtain, a bottle of olive oil and several bottles of wine? "When's the party? And can I come?"
1457 2018-01-31 21:18:18 Coal is a dying industry. The cost of wind and solar has dramatically dropped and as accessible as roof tiles for anyone. I know the Oil/Gas/Coal lobby is lining your pockets, but your blatant disregard for facts will be your disgraceful legacy.

1462 2018-01-31 21:18:06 You mean like moving the goalposts on energy east by creating new downstream regulation on oil. US just overtook Saudis and Russians on oil production and you people think more regulations will help. Newsflash the word wants oil they will just get it somewherelse.
1463 2018-01-31 21:17:54 If the oil were worth getting someone would be drilling. Unless the price goes through the roof and someone finds a way to drill that far out in the S. Atlantic winter I don't see it being relevant. Access to Antarctica no doubt very important but with the Anzac's so nearby 1/
1464 2018-01-31 21:17:49 Got access to clove oil? Usu in health area or nutrition or mebbe essential oils. It'll numb ur nerve very well, it's a topical. Just try not to get it on ur tongue, will also numb that! It's a lifesaver tho
1465 2018-01-31 21:17:47 I'm telling you. The oils they use in frying those stuffs is like condemned motor oil. I bought some one day too,nobody tell me the hunger vanish after one hit my taste buds.
1466 2018-01-31 21:17:39 Hi Paul, all the underpainting is in acrylic which I leave to dry thoroughly for a day/2 in front of a radiator or in a window facing the sun,before applying any oil, Means that the first layer of oil paint can be applied quite thinly but the strength of colour is always striking

1473 2018-01-31 21:16:16 Dollar immediately fell post FOMC statement, Gold and Silver popped, then they reversed and dollar tried to rally and failed (PPT?). Gold and Silver ended at HOD. Meanwhile, Oil just went up throughout. 5 min charts tell the entire story.

1479 2018-01-31 21:15:53 Stop allowing close relations with Saudi Arabia that end up in the hands of extremist groups that terrorize countries for their oil.  Stop pushing the deep state narrative on MSM by corporate leaders that even Eisenhower warned us about.

1483 2018-01-31 21:14:51 Disturbing , is how readily the GOP joined forces with snake oil salesman T.  Independents must come together and moderate Dems and reps you can find common ground...somewhere else.  It's not them it's us. We need some space.

1489 2018-01-31 21:14:27 Since Trump only eats cheeseburgers I doubt he cares about people’s livelihoods involving lobsters and crabs. And Big Oil has much more donor money than fishermen.

1503 2018-01-31 21:12:51 Trump has given our country to the oil companies to pollute the oceans & land. Very sad day for america. Trump is destroying America as gop fill their pickets.

1505 2018-01-31 21:12:44 I I totally disagree. The Malvinas Islands have enormous fish and oil resources. In addition, that puts NATO one step away from the continent and, more importantly, very close to Antarctica.
1506 2018-01-31 21:12:25 Is olive oil good for you? Yes. . . . .But drowning 50 kcal of salad, with 400 kcal of oil (even EVOO) is not the way to go. Think moderation!
1507 2018-01-31 21:12:24 Sure they will. Let's not forget people who she appointed are anti oil activists.
1508 2018-01-31 21:12:21 Clean energy is, perhaps, the fastest growing global industry ... Trump is killing job opportunities for Americans (mostly in red states where solar is hot) & killing investment opportunities for his precious 1 percenters. But hey that’s okay as long as Putin & Exxon can sell oil
1509 2018-01-31 21:12:14 Ooph. Sugar addiction at it's finest: I brought a super healthy lunch today: shrimp & avocado salad, homemade dressing with lime juice and olive oil, and midway through, I can feel the sugar craving kick in.

1544 2018-01-31 21:09:08 Rick Simpson's oil is supposed to be nothing short of a miracle.
1545 2018-01-31 21:09:07 La compra de crudo al exterior se incrementó un 300 % en relación con 2015. Las beneficiarias directas fueron Shell, Axion (Esso), Oil Combustibles y Petrobras, a las que les conviene refinar el petróleo importado antes que producirlo localmente... preparando el saqueo de YPF
1546 2018-01-31 21:09:04 I can tell you that Trump has rolled back all but 7 of the 200+ regulations put on the oil industry. And I personally think that is indirectly responsible for ground breaking this fall on 1st new Oil Refinery in the US in 40 years.
1547 2018-01-31 21:08:43 It’s okay to call it tar. It always was tar until Capp campaigned to change it. Just thick oil. There is an actual community in the middle of the mines called tar island. Huge a bouts of “tar” is actually used at alcan. It comes from Alberta also.

1551 2018-01-31 21:08:19 Yeah..script is uncomplicated - undiluted influence peddling & leveraging.Time was when firms used to go lobbying influential retired generals to serve on their boards. Guess what a durable operator like Gen Gusau can do as chairman of a construction or oil firm
1552 2018-01-31 21:08:17 A boy would say that.  Oil & gas & coal, for that matter, have been digital for a very long time.  Satellites & supercomputers & the like are no stranger to the aforementioned natural resources.  Thank you.  Note, I like GE, & you have a nice smile.
1553 2018-01-31 21:08:14 Steal their oil and make sure they use our money
1554 2018-01-31 21:08:06 Other hand getting my tire fixed and oil change on Friday. Road trip next Friday to Grand Rapids to see Luke Combs and hopefully I can find someone who wants to go with
1555 2018-01-31 21:07:59 Don’t undercook the noodles and run cold water over them before touching them or you’ll burn your fingers.  Oil will keep them from sticking together while you’re assembling the lasagna. Have fun, and post pics, or it didn’t happen!

1558 2018-01-31 21:07:44 Given the amount of work coming my way from the oil & gas industry at the moment, I would definitely say there is a lot of work and oil left in the North Sea. Probably even more off the West coast of Scotland, although large areas might be unworkable due to UK Gov munitions dump.
1559 2018-01-31 21:07:21 Oil and commodities telling real story here
1560 2018-01-31 21:07:15 I don’t really like oil paints that much
1561 2018-01-31 21:07:12 You missed the boat Krugman, see what is there to be seen. Nanny state of entitlement dependency is systematically destroying the work ethic. Venezuela- why bust your buns on a farm when you can sit on your ass and get an oil royalty stipend from nanny government=food shortage.
1562 2018-01-31 21:06:59 I've watched people go down the MLM rabbit hole, but the essential oil people are a special breed.

1566 2018-01-31 21:06:07 Lol oil is a bonus. That doesn’t mean it’s not an existing potential source of revenue (currently the oil money is all funnelled into subsidizing London). That statement and that action are consistent with each other, and indeed any other course of action would be dishonest

1572 2018-01-31 21:05:29 In that case she should drink a quart of oil and breath in coal dust every day.  What harm could a little more carbon do?
1573 2018-01-31 21:04:27 @ChrisGPackham just watched Lost Girl - 11yo son has already banned palm oil in the house and written to Cadburys, 12yo daughter has chosen it as topic for debate competition #inspiring

1576 2018-01-31 21:04:16 y’all stay on folks for putting coconut oil on their faces. what works for some may not work for others
1577 2018-01-31 21:04:05 Seems like more rapid growth started a little before start of oil production
1578 2018-01-31 21:04:04 Balsamic, Olive Oil, Strawberries, Baby Kale.  

Folks, it was good.
1579 2018-01-31 21:04:01 Oil changes are only the beginning of proper car care. Tune ups, checking your tires' air pressure and other tasks are musts to keep your vehicle in tip-top shape.
1580 2018-01-31 21:04:00 London
1581 2018-01-31 21:04:00 We would obviously be ok, oil price is linked to the price of Scotch mist and Brig O Doon! We will survive and prosper on50% down on predicted oil revenue!
1582 2018-01-31 21:03:55 If I am going to get targeted ads for beard oil, they should at least be @rhettmc's beard oil.
1583 2018-01-31 21:03:54 You DO understand that private companies own the oil? We are raping our country for the benefit for big corporations. How is the little guy helped? I'm all ears.
1584 2018-01-31 21:03:50 I have olive oil. Will it work alone? Ha.
1585 2018-01-31 21:03:36 These people always want to give you a list of things to do to your car...i just need an oil change
1586 2018-01-31 21:03:32 Overheard conversation: “you know Amy my hands are always sweaty I just naturally produce a lot of oil”
1587 2018-01-31 21:03:18 More like world-shapers
1588 2018-01-31 21:03:12 Trump seeks to cut research on renewable energies budget by 72 percent. Wonder why, couldn't possibly have anything to do with his connections to big oil. Lol. Keep em sick ignorant and poor right?
1589 2018-01-31 21:03:09 All I want is Oli Oli Oli with a dab of oil. I already have a red and white kit with his name on it. I jus wanna keep a handsome French model striker in my squad, have you jealous fantasizing mind in awe...Thank you for the memories @_OlivierGiroud_ #AFC #AlwaysAGunner
1590 2018-01-31 21:03:04 All controlled by private corporations. Notice how even when oil went way down to $20 that gasoline never went below $3. Hello. Government has not control and is not putting away oil in the reserve.
1591 2018-01-31 21:02:58 FYI a barrel of maple syrup is 30x the cost of a barrel of oil #staywoke
1592 2018-01-31 21:02:55 Trump didn't need to read his speechwriters' State of the Union address to prove he cares about NOBODY but Donald Trump. But he's failing at convincing America that he's anything but a snake oil salesman.
1593 2018-01-31 21:02:54 Interesting. Well I would just make sure the carbohydrates you do decide to include in your diet to be stuff like sweet potatoes. Cauliflower/coconut flour crust pizza is dope af.

Have you tried MCT oil?
1594 2018-01-31 21:02:51 Siri, does @TGowdySC bathe in peanut oil?
1595 2018-01-31 21:02:50 Mix clove and olive oil and apply to the spot. Instant relief.
1596 2018-01-31 21:02:46 Damn straight! We have supported BC oil and gas workers in the oil sands for years! Shut down the oil and gas to BC and see how they like it! If BC wants to go green, let’s give it to them......
1597 2018-01-31 21:02:43 This reminds my mum of when she used to go to sea with my dad on his 1/4 mile long oil tanker! She said the wave would hit the bridge (at the back of ship) at almost exactly the same time as it hit the bow!!

1601 2018-01-31 21:02:24 Drilling for crude is a whole lot easier than from the oil sands, that's just how it works.
1602 2018-01-31 21:02:09 NIOTICE not a songlüe mention of the fact that these LNG shipments are coming from a US Treasury sanctioned oil company
1603 2018-01-31 21:02:00 I'm not aware of any crisis in #America BUT the two largest oil producers, #Texas & #Nebraska, in the WORLD, keep inching UP the price of gasoline. Can't think of ant reasons except #GREED & #THIEVES.
1604 2018-01-31 21:01:55 There isn’t enough oil you can pull out of the ground to fill that gap. Economic inequality is the theft of someone’s tomorrow and I live for today.
1605 2018-01-31 21:01:51 We shouldn't mention ISIS, opioid problem, gangs or terrorists? Ridiculas argument. Address is report on issues, report on actions taken
1606 2018-01-31 21:01:50 But if you're saying cryptocurrency promotes oil consumption - possibly true but kind of beside the point, oil market is in terminal decline.
1607 2018-01-31 21:01:34 No heating. Boiler broke. literally freezing no amount of layers will solve this... I need a hotel and remember to order oil next time  #freezing
1608 2018-01-31 21:01:05 Offshore oil & gas drilling does not belong on our coast. Welcomed @oceana to ED&IR Committee today to present proposed resolution opposing Trump Admin decision to open our waters to drilling & exploration. Thanks to those who spoke and to my colleagues for unanimous support.
1609 2018-01-31 21:01:03 ahswear the oil inside some condoms can fry two eggs
1610 2018-01-31 21:01:02 Agreed ST... BUT I think we can also agree that unless the dollar can find some way to rally and soon, which it may, metals can go higher from here. For me, seeing is believing with the dollar. Oil called fake on the $ bounce today. Tomorrow is another day.
1611 2018-01-31 21:00:58 I’m a native West Virginian and I know you are selling us snake oil, but thanks for the memories.

1618 2018-01-31 21:00:29 Apply jojoba oil for 20 minutes before going to the shower. This promotes fast hair growth!
1619 2018-01-31 21:00:26 That's the worst! As a massage therapist, there are sessions I want to end before they start for that very reason, but since I'm employed, I can't avoid them. 
I can't smudge at work either, so I have to use Reiki and chakra pendants. Sometimes bergamot oil helps.
1620 2018-01-31 21:00:17 a maligned #vegetable findin its way to hipness.  broiled #brussellsprouts with some olive oil. now that's the way to celebrate #nationalbrussellsproutsday y'all.  #WednesdayWisdom
1621 2018-01-31 21:00:16 @HEMI_Astiddy Here’s a good one for you, I changed the oil in my neon and the bottom of the filter had three hefty dents in it but the paint wasn’t chipped or scratched. The way it’s tucked behind the oil pan I don’t know how anything could get to it.
1622 2018-01-31 21:00:14 Exactly!  Trump is actually doing what he said he will do.  The kid looked like he was forced to speak for Democrats after their desperate attempt to find a Hillary replacement
1623 2018-01-31 21:00:10 good meat tho

what you cooking it in? i wanna try cooking in butter (i usually just do olive oil) but i havent been to a good butchers in 7 motnhs
1624 2018-01-31 21:00:03 I too have problems this year with dry lips. I started using organic coconut oil and it helps but your mouth looks greasy.

1629 2018-01-31 20:59:32 Lamb shank for lunch today: I heated it, added 2 tsp peanut oil, browned the shank, then added 1/8 c of water, a cut up onion, some garlic, rosemary, salt, parsley, lowered heat after full pressure, and came back 40 min later. With chinese broccoli: lunch. Luv my p/c.
1630 2018-01-31 20:59:29 Every TV chef says, "Makes sure you use some GOOD olive oil..." in a  recipe. Is there bad olive oil? Are there foods that call for BAD olive  oil? #sickathome #watchingtoomuchTV

1634 2018-01-31 20:59:13 It don’t take long for a car to get done from a oil change wtf
1635 2018-01-31 20:59:09 I'll never the jaw droppingly stupid responses to healthcare questions from Gary Johnson. At one point, he  said we could bargain shop for surgeons. Sounds legit 

Libertarianism is another snake oil sold w/ legalized marijuana the same way the GOP sell their BS pro-life lies.
1636 2018-01-31 20:59:08 No problem.  There are many other countries willing to take the lead on this.  Sure, the decision will look ridiculous when we hit peak oil, but by then they'll have made as much money as they can and screw everyone else.
1637 2018-01-31 20:59:07 What government could be against the idea of clean energy?  It is ridiculous but companies who make their money from oil, etc. do not want alternatives.  No preparation for the future when those energy sources run out.  We are living in a country tied to 1950 beliefs.
1638 2018-01-31 20:59:04 Sorry all suppose to be has not had
1639 2018-01-31 20:59:01 Finally made the oil change appointment for my car that I’ve been putting off four three weeks  just have to make an eye appointment next.
1640 2018-01-31 20:58:55 What similar scenario? Driving drunk compared to CBD oil?
1641 2018-01-31 20:58:49 My oil needs a car change
1642 2018-01-31 20:58:43 Seer run off is a bigger issue than oil. Water and oil don t mix and it can be cleaned up. Shit and water mix and is very deadly.. just the facts folks.
1643 2018-01-31 20:58:41 True, but just about everything we have these days contains oil products.
1644 2018-01-31 20:58:35 Registration, state inspection and changing my oil, I’d say today was a very productive day.
1645 2018-01-31 20:58:35 Lol I can’t, I gotta take the car for a oil change , then go to the bank and then home
1646 2018-01-31 20:58:28 The fact that Trump associates with this snake oil salesman is insane.
1647 2018-01-31 20:58:27 I’m no oil painting but f**kin hell
1648 2018-01-31 20:58:23 As you guys were celebrating exceeding your target for the 2nd year in a row in December & the fuel scarcity was biting hard, all I could think of was "these oil marketers need Hameed Ali in their lives"
1649 2018-01-31 20:58:22 We know thousands of people die each yr from smoking related illnesses but it continues to be a legal poison that people are addicted to. So many people could benefit from CBD oil but it continues to be demonized as a gateway drug @Jeremy_Hunt #Epilepsy #epilepsyawareness
1650 2018-01-31 20:58:21 That's why they put oil in them... 

Goddammit, just let me do it. This is the last time though. OK?
1651 2018-01-31 20:58:05 Or that the only jobs are oil jobs? Does that mean that fish forever take second place to oil for now and that being foreign oil. Gawd. Worse than trump in the brazen brass to presume to speak from Constitution applying to only AB.
1652 2018-01-31 20:57:49 "10 ways to reduce pain", they missed 1, should be "11 ways to reduce pain. But then the NHS would not make money from CBD Oil. #cbd #cbdoils #NHS

1657 2018-01-31 20:57:12 This fool put water on a fire that started with oil 
1658 2018-01-31 20:57:02 @ONUS_Agronomy I’ve been trying to get in crop rate of firepower/verdict + 2L gly+ amsul+ oil and then using 3 months of no rain to finish the job (or para DK). As you know, just be careful with plantback, verdict 100ml is about 1 mth to cereals, 800 ml is at least 3mths.
1659 2018-01-31 20:56:56 Yes because you absolutely have to smoke the cannabis. Not like you can get it an oil, or anything . Still, nice to see it being discussed. #truthaboutgettingfit #LegalizeIt
People are waking up.
1660 2018-01-31 20:56:46 Shame on you a country that have been producing oil since time immemorial can't boast of a functional refinery. Until thunder start striking those that has looted away our future Nigeria will not work.

1664 2018-01-31 20:56:29 I will get the olive oil.
1665 2018-01-31 20:56:24 good morning i hope KSA's oil run out soon
1666 2018-01-31 20:56:21 4 - Also, Morgane, you know *nothing* about the places where oil & gas are "workplaces". Have you worked at a refinery? I can say No. Have you been in a refinery for more than a "tour". I can say No.
1667 2018-01-31 20:56:12 Or actually taking action against them without giving them free promotion in front of millions of people.
1668 2018-01-31 20:56:05 Glad you agree! I try to avoid grapeseed oil as it's so unstable.

1674 2018-01-31 20:55:20 But British looting of Biafra oil and other mineral resources in fraud name Nigeria will continue even if it takes insurgency, internal displacement, terrorism of Fulani herdsmen and bokoharam. British is evil
1675 2018-01-31 20:55:20 Yea crime by illegal aliens or gang members is not a problem anywhere in the country. No mention should be made. Pure stupidity

1677 2018-01-31 20:55:16 Ben Ghazi=Been Had .Regime. change, stole gold and other resources, displaced 100s 0f thousands, OIL,destabilize,kill.more innocent people.Fd up.

1680 2018-01-31 20:55:02 Double-header Crude Oil Special coming up on tomorrow night's @MacroVoices podcast. Petroleum geologist @aeberman12 headlines, then veteran commercial broker @phemsworth joins us in 'post game'. Should be live by 8pm ET Thursday. #OOTT $CL_F $RB_F #Brent
1681 2018-01-31 20:55:01 Babies seem boring but when you oil them up they can reach incredible speeds on a slip n slide #BellLetsTalk
1682 2018-01-31 20:54:43 Finding a shit load of oil a hundred years ago and using it to build a state designed to eventually buy a football club with the aim of getting Pep - serious long term thinking!
1683 2018-01-31 20:54:42 Burn the midnight oil with Mr.Rosli 
#feelsgoodman
1684 2018-01-31 20:54:40 Did you see xvo expert @adollarmore’s tweet? Damage done to Spanish oil industry. She never believed the oil theory. Thank heavens for independent minds!
1685 2018-01-31 20:54:36 Could you elaborate on them? The Panama canal ended any strategic importance of the islands and as lovely as I'm sure they are, not exactly an economic powerhouse. I know there's oil but I doubt it'll do anyone any good unless the world changes dramatically
1686 2018-01-31 20:54:29 will Cj take notice of oil prices??
1687 2018-01-31 20:54:11 Holy shit. Highway 285 between nm and just over the Texas border is literally the most terrifying road I've ever been on. I feel like I'm in a mad max movie. I've nearly flipped in potholes, been smooshed by giant trucks, driven thru dust storms. Oil fields look post apocalyptic
1688 2018-01-31 20:54:09 I don't love their voices together sadly... oil and water to my ears.
1689 2018-01-31 20:53:42 This type of equivocation is intellectual stupidity. Because any other individual comitts a crime does not lessen the nature of this problem
1690 2018-01-31 20:53:38 Not sure about resin, tbh, but I had this exchange with Pete re: sap:

Pete: I have sap on my hands, h*ck!
Me: Try olive oil.
[five minutes later]
Pete: Wow, that worked
Me: I ... know.
1691 2018-01-31 20:53:35 Can someone explain to me why all feminists have green fucking hair?? Like these bitches just dropped by asking for an oil change and 8 of these green haired bitches came crawling out of this hyundai
1692 2018-01-31 20:53:28 Apparently you can’t have it both ways, Rachel. Your stupid Climate leadership & carbon tax is wrecking the Alberta economy, & now the alt. Left (environmental activists,NDP, etc.) don’t like our oil & pipelines.....Big surprise!!
1693 2018-01-31 20:53:22 How does depending on unethical and corrupt foriegn energy or condeming people to poverty help the planet exactly?  They (opec, usa, russia) won't stop selling oil just because we do. Good for @RachelNotley
1694 2018-01-31 20:53:19 ive been telling you all that coconut oil is bad for your skin and you didnt listen.... now u will pay
1695 2018-01-31 20:53:18 Small numbers  (i.e. much less than 100K) of wildfowl die from various causes regularly. Pollution, oil slicks, disease, etc. Dead and dying birds are found and the source of the problem is identified. Why does this not happen with 100K lead-poisoned birds?
1696 2018-01-31 20:53:11 World Peace  and UN  , can send  a thingy, for a soulution,   all Nations,  at any hour, can accept Jesus as Savior, Redeemer,  then  just add  pictures of  Father GOD, & Jesus,  in Mosques,  then anoint with Holy Oil. Holy Oil's on the web. or use  Olive oil.
1697 2018-01-31 20:53:10 Lol you hittin that oil burner now ?? The fuck away from me you nasty ass pig
1698 2018-01-31 20:53:06 Its the closest oil to our natural oils that the body produces
1699 2018-01-31 20:52:24 Charge some coconut oil under this super blue blood moon get ur skin and ur energy right 
1700 2018-01-31 20:52:11 Sarah Smith is on speed dial so she can pop up with "The fall in oil prices drives a coach and horses through the case for independence, doesn't it....?" She's been awfully quiet with that mantra lately. 
1701 2018-01-31 20:52:02 What was the point of booking an appointment if it’s taking 2 hours to change the oil of my car and do a tire rotation?
1702 2018-01-31 20:52:01 See, I was substituting serum for an oil but now looks like if oil goes after night cream, I still need a serum. I miss the old days of cleanse, tone and moisturise with whatever your mum bought you from Superdrug!
1703 2018-01-31 20:52:00 Mam........dont get me fucking started about those demonic pills!!!!!!!!! I loath pills!!!!! ...... unless they r filled with simpson oil that is
1704 2018-01-31 20:51:53 I am a supporter Notley and have worked Alberta oil since the 80s, I am from BC and question this pipeline only because it lands right into the most populated area of B.C. following rivers and ending at the ocean. Why not get Northern Gateway back on the table as a compromise?
1705 2018-01-31 20:51:39 Unfortunately it's BC dippers and Quebec who want to tear country apart by putting a tourniquet on our oil business.  KM should be able to sue Burnaby and now prov NDP for damages.
1706 2018-01-31 20:51:37 Ooh I do like a food photo. They always make me think of things I want to eat. The puff pastry thing reminds me of a thing I really like - circles of puff pastry with cherry tomatoes on rolled in olive oil, roasted 'til done, served with creme fraiche and pesto. MMM.
1707 2018-01-31 20:51:32 Its not as good as my last car. I ran it on 50% vegetable oil. It smelled like a fish and chip shop.
1708 2018-01-31 20:51:22 I think elderberry is the new coconut oil. It apparently cures what ails you. You know, if you're not into the whole modern medicine thing. 

I joined FB mom groups thinking they'd be helpful. They're actually a weird blend of hilarious and terrifying.

1711 2018-01-31 20:50:31 *celebrates with a chug of MCT oil*
1712 2018-01-31 20:50:31 Even if there was the remotest chance of it actually being trustworthy, creating a cryptocurrency pegged to the price of a barrel of oil, in 2018, is clearly the brainchild of a man who has been kicked in the head by a horse.
1713 2018-01-31 20:50:30 All the best Oil. Next time we play Chelsea, if you are presented with a sitter, stick it wide would you.....? #NaNaNaNaa Girooouuud...
1714 2018-01-31 20:50:12 Our dependence on foreign oil has been cut by more than half and our production of renewable energy has more than doubled. HS graduation level at it's highest level ever. He's more responsible for this economy (though far from perfect) than trump is. And the stock market tripled
1715 2018-01-31 20:50:10 I came to get an oil change and so far, I’ve been offered beer, wine and lunch hahahahah i should do this more often
1716 2018-01-31 20:50:02 They are saving the oil for prince whallah-hallah-gang-bang
1717 2018-01-31 20:50:01 I was born with autoimmune disorders & can’t process high animal or bad vegetable fat or most grains but I use wild fish, take 3200mg wild fish oil with 1000mg D and DHA Omega 3, super collagen, high multi vitamins with iron, use egg white protein, cold pressed olive oil, cheeses
1718 2018-01-31 20:50:01 70$ price is more or less break even point for shale producers.
Oil react to us data which is released every week.
OECD members release data only once 2 or 3 month i guess.
At 70$ dollars even canada, Brazil n north Arctic supply will resume.

OPEC is doomed
1719 2018-01-31 20:49:55 Folatil Oil Dlm Jahe Sudah Sejak Dulu Tbukti Bisa Mngatasi Problem Penyumbatan Hidung Dan Sesak Nafas
1720 2018-01-31 20:49:51 Huh. Maybe olive oil then? Something oil based?
1721 2018-01-31 20:49:49 @FoEE_Antoine did cite original report (Nature Communications). Abstract of that paper clearly states 50-75% of recent methane increase is from fossil fuels (NOT land use/agriculture). Paper does not address what about fossil fuels drove change, but shale gas & oil likely culprit
1722 2018-01-31 20:49:45 Oh! Coconut oil for oil pulling!  I thought you meant the tea.
1723 2018-01-31 20:49:08 Presido you studied Civil Engineering right?
1724 2018-01-31 20:49:02 みんながそうやって炒められて揚げられて…ねぇ、誰のおかげ?誰のおかげかな?

＼It's OIL!!!／
1725 2018-01-31 20:49:01 Washed Lex, did her oil change, flushed every fluid and topped it all off with new fluids, vacuumed and detailed from the inside! My cars are always clean
1726 2018-01-31 20:48:48 So much oil on that face. It's like an older Squeaky Voiced Teen from The Simpsons. Must be residual runoff from his hair.
1727 2018-01-31 20:48:39 Would at least be nice to see (a) some recognition that the oil sands contribute significantly to the lifestyle Cdns have come to enjoy, and (b) that expanding a pipeline that has already existed for over half a century is the bare minimum, not an environmental catastrophe
1728 2018-01-31 20:48:38 are they going to allow there oil to be audited?
1729 2018-01-31 20:48:36 You know him personally?
1730 2018-01-31 20:48:36 Didn't help they privatised everything to do with oil to buggery (as usual). Norway showed how it shouldve been done
1731 2018-01-31 20:48:31 RT @XX_MORENA: Need to go on baecation and play "Why You Wanna?" By T.I. while my man rubs my ass with baby oil.
1732 2018-01-31 20:48:14 My thoughts:

1) Saying it is "backed" by oil is meaningless, it is fiat currency
2) If the government issues, it is centralized just like fiat currency
3) It will be traceable by the government so no privacy like cash

It is debt, but many may be forced to use it
1733 2018-01-31 20:48:09 W.e. a.r.e. o.n.l.y.  g.e.t.t.i.n.g.  50 j.o.b.s.  vs.  ~100,000 lost in the inevitable oil spill.
1734 2018-01-31 20:47:59 Sitting in quick lane getting my car oil changed and I happened to sneeze and literally all 6 people also sitting in here "blessed" me  

These are the kind of friends that I need man, my heart 
1735 2018-01-31 20:47:49 America has so many good People.Sell your Oil to the your own. Rub the Belly and back and a little in each one's Slithering  Crack!
1736 2018-01-31 20:47:45 Just like anything else, if you add enough butter, oil, and salt, it suddenly becomes edible. Unhealthy, but edible.
1737 2018-01-31 20:47:45 You slice the aubergine really thin and then you literally only need to mix smoked paprika, salt, garlic powder, liquid smoke and oil n then bake for like 18 minutes
1738 2018-01-31 20:47:44 Oil pulling is great for dental hygiene. Google for benefits.
1739 2018-01-31 20:47:41 @dupagedodge. #deceptive  Just because you "discount " labor you can't call listed oil change price a promo rate.  No disclaimer on coupon!
1740 2018-01-31 20:47:32 on your chart Brann ... is that London time or Chicago central time?
1741 2018-01-31 20:47:20 Being silent on any issue is the best way to solve the problem.
1742 2018-01-31 20:47:20 "Pregabalin" that's a nice kidney killer! We know many people that take CBD Oil for fibromyalgia, with results.
1743 2018-01-31 20:47:04 folks!! if you want decent skin detox your liver and lymphatic system !! and stop putting coconut oil on your face that shit is eviL
1744 2018-01-31 20:46:56 I didn't work all those weekends and claim the OIL just to get allowance deducted yo
1745 2018-01-31 20:46:49 yep, you were all over Oil, not the February seasonality.  Unless this time's different, should keep going in February.
1746 2018-01-31 20:46:33 I have an 07 HD, never leaked a drop of oil, that’s old school HD, not the new ones. Funny, when people describe other motorcycles they always say “looks like it sounds like HD..wonder why?
1747 2018-01-31 20:46:26 I was there!  Midnight Oil blew them away
1748 2018-01-31 20:46:11 Good luck got your hands full with this administration. Just seems like we or at least some of us wants to destroy our treasures and in turn our wildlife. I just cannot understand. Most of the time over a barrel of oil or some gas. It's a shame! Again good luck
1749 2018-01-31 20:46:09 Why is offshore oil and gas better than onshore not sure they have have vastly different safety record.
1750 2018-01-31 20:46:04 Good thing I didn’t use the tea tree oil one yesterday
1751 2018-01-31 20:46:02 awwww.  cute.  make sure to use some oil so it doesn't cause rash.
1752 2018-01-31 20:45:53 BC argues against the pipeline because it will increase tanker traffic and your solution is to import oil via tankers. Did you think this through?
1753 2018-01-31 20:45:47 Combine 11 lbs elderberry with 1 pound beer. Add generous amounts of Olive Oil. Bake for 30 minutes at 200 degrees. Serve with a nice chianti.
1754 2018-01-31 20:45:47 Mourinho is off to oil the bamboo stick.
1755 2018-01-31 20:45:44 Lol now nobody wanna use coconut oil. Y’all a trip. Everybody skin different. Relax
1756 2018-01-31 20:45:42 Such a perfect day! Frankincense oil in my new Aromatherapy Oil Diffuser, making some lunch while watching #TheQueensCourt After Show in my onesie! 
1757 2018-01-31 20:45:30 just like the strategic oil reserve is a stupid business move, but important for the rear window.
1758 2018-01-31 20:45:24 $CL_F / #oil continues higher & confirms bounce off 20MA in bulliish channel on daily chart. $UWT ? in 30.74
1759 2018-01-31 20:45:19 100% preventable.
1760 2018-01-31 20:45:19 I hate having a bmw..... $240 for a battery, $60 for coding the battery in, $160 for spark plugs, $150 for oil fuck you
1761 2018-01-31 20:45:12 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
1762 2018-01-31 20:45:12 @LushLtd Yuge hot hair oil is aaaaaaamazing! Smells delicious!!
1763 2018-01-31 20:45:07 Thank you for posting this picture. It reminded me that my car is overdue for an oil change.
1764 2018-01-31 20:44:57 I want to be Rich why.... so I can have my personal chef and hair stylist.. someone to wash my hair every week put some oil and braid them
1765 2018-01-31 20:44:51 Vitamin E oil!!
1766 2018-01-31 20:44:49 There was always plenty of oil, even during the spike prices.
1767 2018-01-31 20:44:49 What's more amazing is that oil was a lot lower per barrel in the past and yet this is the worst result in last 50 years. Between 1985 and 2004 it was significantly lower than it has been recently.
1768 2018-01-31 20:44:49 someone get grayson some coconut oil for hair masks
1769 2018-01-31 20:44:49 You are in error. When climate disasters bankrupt our society there will be no jobs at all. Pipelines cost money, pump fossil fuel, and create minimal numbers of jobs. The oil must not be unearthed or shipped anywhere. Time to change the plan.
1770 2018-01-31 20:44:40 That's where the Oil money goes.
1771 2018-01-31 20:44:39 “You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows” (Psalm 23:5).
1772 2018-01-31 20:44:35 Coffee is the second most traded commodity on Earth after oil.
1773 2018-01-31 20:44:34 This Car Wash and Oil Change was much needed
1774 2018-01-31 20:44:27 Put some coconut oil on ya balddaughter head and let's pray she never have to wear wigs that start at her eyebrows like you 
1775 2018-01-31 20:44:23 This oil burner in my room smells good.
1776 2018-01-31 20:44:07 Don’t worry guys! It’s on the listJust waiting on a new rocker cover gasket. The rocker & the oil cap were in black enamel from the factory from what I can tell. So will get them done in shiny black. Can’t wait!
1777 2018-01-31 20:44:06 But it does make one wonder where all the oil futures open interest is coming from.
1778 2018-01-31 20:44:00 I can’t believe people fall for this snake oil!
1779 2018-01-31 20:43:52 Yall dumb as hell if yall moisturizing your face with coconut oil. Who are yall taking advice from ???
1780 2018-01-31 20:43:50 You’re never ready for change but it’s often the best thing to happen! Good luck!
And, If you need me to affect my 1900s oil barron accent and be a reference as to how you ran my derrick fields with capital efficiency, just ask 
1781 2018-01-31 20:43:45 2 part Olive oil (or coconut oil) and 1 part brown sugar. Use to shave with. It’ll trash your razor but you won’t have as much prickly
1782 2018-01-31 20:43:42 Point is, not everyone in every family is worthy or meets criteria in a merit based system. 
Point system is the most fair and equal method
1783 2018-01-31 20:43:33 Rapeseed oil production leaves a by product of rapeseed meal. What do vegans plan to do with this and all other human food by products? Animal ag currently solves that little dilemma for us.
1784 2018-01-31 20:43:25 Fun fact: the more oil you use the quicker your stir fry fries and the less likely you are to burn your wok!

1785 2018-01-31 20:43:12 Cbd oil only probably
1786 2018-01-31 20:43:10 A sweet chocoholic INTJ oil heiress, undoing an aquamarine skirt, runs the tips of her fingers delicately along the spine of a placid Canadian Pacer horse.
1787 2018-01-31 20:42:57 He was getting his oil changed and had to stop what he was doing? 
1788 2018-01-31 20:42:56 Agreed. Fed risks causing the very thing they are trying to prepare for, but they are preparing for it by trying to raise rates and need inflation to do that. Only way to get there is weaker dollar, higher oil, higher stocks imho.
1789 2018-01-31 20:42:51 تآكسي 
1790 2018-01-31 20:42:50 If y'all never took anything from anything I've said about skin care please PLEASE please don't use bars of soap on your face. It strips your lipid bilayer. Also don't put fuckin coconut oil on your face geez.
1791 2018-01-31 20:42:48 Then I just filled up my F150 for $56 bucks which prolly went to some foreign oil company and I'm bought to go get a 12 pack of Natty. Pretty pissed bout it. Still hate trump tho.
1792 2018-01-31 20:42:16 so who got to rub the baby oil on her? Just wanna ask them some questions
1793 2018-01-31 20:42:13 Maybe besides drinking water, you could try moisturizers to battle the acne. It could be that your skin is overcompensating with oils and helping it out by moisturizing could lessen that effect. It sounds weird to use oil to fight oil, but you could give jojoba/rosehip oil a shot
1794 2018-01-31 20:42:04 Tea tree oil! Dilute it down in a little water and apply & leave on overnight!
1795 2018-01-31 20:42:01 That @RustOleum oil base is some good stuff!I use it on my wooden box deer stands!They last a lot longer!
1796 2018-01-31 20:41:56 Hopefully consistent games from here on in will help the oil.  It has been a horrendous schedual this season so far with tje breals between oil games. Consistency is what tjey need and less  afternoon games less time to think of bad game
1797 2018-01-31 20:41:46 @WengerOut_Bot @Arsenal @piersmorgan #WengerOut  What Wenger & Kroenke need to understand that they cannot keep fibbing that they cannot compete & have a cash rich balance sheet without even putting an effort. Someone is bound to say sell and we will do it. We need oil money
1798 2018-01-31 20:41:04 Kem Lux Beauty’s bestselling Body Glow oil is coming back on the first week of British summer (March 25th) new, improved and sleeker 
1799 2018-01-31 20:41:02 Essential oil, yes. The actual flower, nope
1800 2018-01-31 20:40:58 Other suggestions include elderberry (always popular) and lime essential oil.

1805 2018-01-31 20:40:17 I asked my grandma if she was checking a bag for Hawaii and she responds “Ive narrowed it down to 9 pairs of shoes Taylor Noel and my tanning oil doesn’t come in a 3oz”.... I shouldn’t have even asked.

1812 2018-01-31 20:39:41 Gawd, there goes Brett Wilson on BNN. Why can't Alberta find spokespersons who don't exude arrogance, entitlement, exceptionalism and who don't ignore global realities (the oil industry created its own supply glut). #cdnpoli
1813 2018-01-31 20:39:21 Gone were those regimes when oil money decided and determined the economic strength of the most populous black nation.  Kudos to the African king of corruption crusaders. I salute PMB.
1814 2018-01-31 20:39:14 Why doesn't someone do a piece on the price fixing of oil companies? If bread was 400, how much are the oil companies stealing?
1815 2018-01-31 20:39:11 @bracketdan @SportsSturm I could listen to David Attenborough explain how to change the oil in a car
1816 2018-01-31 20:39:04 I’ve turned into one of those weird essential oil, chakra stone, healing crystal hippie freaks that I used to talk smack about

1819 2018-01-31 20:38:14 If memory serves, it's been a priority in every budget and every mid-biennium review since he got those Big Oil dollar signs in his eyes
1820 2018-01-31 20:38:09 Could we get this itemised special UK deal! How much of Scotland products go to EU after that rebranded UK products? Let get Scotland sale its fish/ oil... itself and see it that is with UK we are dealing! Indyref2

1822 2018-01-31 20:37:38 He wasn't also the Nigerian Oil Minister by chance, was he?
1823 2018-01-31 20:37:32 Especially when they already owe most of that oil to Wall Street, China, and Russia. Selling debt on debt.
1824 2018-01-31 20:37:17 seems like oil is saving the day here for stocks
1825 2018-01-31 20:37:09 Squalane is the "oil" everyone should be using!! its not technically an oil, but it feels like one. its good for oily & dry skin(i mix mine w my moisturizer), and its non-comedogenic!! you can also put it in your hair like.. hello??? coconut oil wishes it were this good

1829 2018-01-31 20:36:15 Olive oil fried rausins with onions and mushrooms. And some wine. It’s an orange, herbed tomato, thyme
1830 2018-01-31 20:36:14 If it’s going to be backed by barrel of oil then what’s the point of also mining it? This should have been a token on another Blockchain.
If I can mine it on my rig, he will still have to back it with his oil..

1833 2018-01-31 20:35:13 I believed in Lance Armstrong for years, too.  Does anyone else view Quin with rose colored glasses?  He claims to be a conservative and an activist.  Oil & water IMHO.

1836 2018-01-31 20:34:32 Wegmans got the signature oil for subs... that shit cant be bought
1837 2018-01-31 20:34:32 I ate a salad with miso sesame dressing and my face is a fucking oil rig pumping 24/7 off the coast of Alaska.
1838 2018-01-31 20:34:13 The biggest economic surprise you could go back and tell someone in 2008 is that 10 years hence we'd have plenty of oil but a housing shortage.
1839 2018-01-31 20:34:10 Is it only cbd oil or is there gonna be bud
1840 2018-01-31 20:34:06 Every time my GI bill gets deposited I feel like I should pamper my car. I’ll get gas, my oil changed, a car wash. Then later I buy tons of food and then wonder where all my money went
1841 2018-01-31 20:34:01 @TGowdySC ain’t fooling me! “Retiring from Politics”.

Naw. You’re gunning for that Attorney general or Supreme Court spot. 

Can’t say nothing slick to a can of oil rowdy Gowdy. The art of the finesse is strong with you.
1842 2018-01-31 20:34:01 I like you a lot better than your husband Melania. I think you REALLY care about the American People. I think Donald is just a Politician selling snake oil. However, I'm probably not telling you anything you don't already know.
1843 2018-01-31 20:33:58 You are most welcome. Add some of your favorite essential oil if you have any and it'll be a spa treat. Lavender would be good if doing before bed.

1847 2018-01-31 20:33:43 People sarcastically making fun of peak oil hysteria aren’t taking into consideration shale production which truly revolutionized where we could extract it from.
1848 2018-01-31 20:33:35 You folks are forgetting that dt &putin &some gop own BILLIONS in Russian oil & want more. THAT’S what his presidency is about. Dt is not blackmailed, he’s a straight-up TRAITOR. Plan to deep drill (totally pillage) ArcticOcean for billions$$$ hence no EPA. Check the facts!!!
1849 2018-01-31 20:32:55 @AURIcomm’s Harold Stanislawski is such a big fan of @goodyear’s soybean oil-based Assurance Weather Ready tires, he bought a set for each of his Buicks. “When I found out these were made from soy oil, I had to get them,” he said. “I hope to have them on my Harley one day.”
1850 2018-01-31 20:32:35 fools can't get enough of that snake oil.
1851 2018-01-31 20:32:34 Why do it now? Oil is cheap. Wait until a war. Geez, we don't need to wrap up everything.
1852 2018-01-31 20:32:31 A pea-sized amount of baby oil can act as a shine hair serum before dashing out the door.

1857 2018-01-31 20:31:57 real estate and oil are good industry, invest in Capt. Crunch All Berries, its never going to get old. I want an Ice Cream truck. I saw one on Rodeo. I thought to myself "he's loaded". It's the guilty pleasure industry
1858 2018-01-31 20:31:55 Doesn't that require quite significant production-lines though? Bio-waste and vegetable oil would otherwise just go to waste

1860 2018-01-31 20:31:33 Deadass bro lemme know if y’all go it was delicious. On the Bee Sting they put a honey chili oil drizzle on it. Omgosh so good.

1863 2018-01-31 20:31:04 I just feel like coconut oil too heavy for anything I could possibly use it for especially my hair don’t want it all greasy
1864 2018-01-31 20:30:57 BP has made two significant oil finds, one west of Shetland and another in the central North Sea that could extend production by more than *three decades* with output doubling to 200,000 barrels a day within two years. 

Cheers to Sinky for the good news. 
1865 2018-01-31 20:30:56 I’m about to do a hot Pilates kettlebell thing class and I accidentally rubbed my legs forgetting I put coconut oil not too long ago and now my hands are slippery. RIP the girl in front of my cuz these kettlebells r about to fly

1868 2018-01-31 20:30:43 I said it was disastrous pairing Jones and smalling
1869 2018-01-31 20:30:38 Even that makes more sense to me! At least it's something people can be forgiven for not realizing--the analogous phenomenon would be horrors at learning there was OIL IN MAYONNAISE.
1870 2018-01-31 20:30:33 This sounds like a great idea! I used lotion but they’re so dry it just soaked it right up! I have honey and olive oil, going to try this tonight before bed! Thank you!

1873 2018-01-31 20:30:12 I prefer inducing a bone-crushing migraine with massive amounts of caffeine, strychnine, and castor oil.

1878 2018-01-31 20:29:39 Definitely not burnt. I suspect it’s the filter’s shine of the oil the chef has used. Tasty.
1879 2018-01-31 20:29:27 Pennzoil pancakes anyone? 
Most food stylists use motor oil to darken color and create a thicker consistency to the syrup, which makes it look even more delicious when photographed.

1880 2018-01-31 20:29:21 If you are doing the work, you get bitch credit. Mix some honey and olive oil together. 2 parts honey to 1 part olive oil. Rub over your hands and cover with some old, clean socks. Let sit for 15 minutes. That'll heal them up.
1881 2018-01-31 20:29:19 We should all electric cars, and heat our houses with electricity and tax the oil companies out of existence. We can put up wind mills and solar panels on everyone’s houses. And then maybe the eco-terrorist can focus on the next Canadian industry we need to drive out of business.
1882 2018-01-31 20:29:04 Why do it now? Oil is cheap. Wait for a war.
1883 2018-01-31 20:28:52 Sweden and Norway are somewhat socialist in that they control and retain the proceeds of their natural resources which are considerable. Instead of universal healthcare and equitable education system we have an oil and coal billionaire surplus in the US, basically.
1884 2018-01-31 20:28:45 Coconut oil is meh to me. Grapeseed oil has completely replaced it for me.
1885 2018-01-31 20:28:34 Is there even oil to be drilled off the shore of Maine? Did you even look into that question? It’s not like oil exists everywhere under the ocean.
1886 2018-01-31 20:28:27 Neither is wind turbines.  You need oil to run them
1887 2018-01-31 20:28:27 The next scalp scrub I’m making is gonna be aloe vera gel, pink hamalayan salt, apple cider vinegar, and Jamaican black castor oil.

1893 2018-01-31 20:27:45 Brilliant. that's like saying "Oil spills can't be bad for the environment because oil comes from nature."
1894 2018-01-31 20:27:34 Warm the oil first :)
1895 2018-01-31 20:27:32 Bio oil! it helps lots and although it doesn’t completely get rid of them it helps to make them fade to make it slightly more bareable. DM me if you need to speak to anyone or talk about it more xx
1896 2018-01-31 20:27:31 Make them into chips little bit of olive oil sea salt or cinnamon. (Healthy)
1897 2018-01-31 20:27:28 Well oil and pipelines are surely in their portfolios

1912 2018-01-31 20:26:17 I am struggling to see how this province is going to make any money to fund the numerous social programs by kicking oil and gas investment out of the province? Raise taxes and borrow more money because apparently it never ends
1913 2018-01-31 20:26:14 For a start any oil sold to wherever would have zero to do with any iScotland Scotgov, gas is being imported from the US, the water thing is a myth, seafood hmm the whole of the UK is surrounded by seafood, whisky I'm sure rUK can do without it for a year or so. 1/2
1914 2018-01-31 20:26:12 2. The stooge for oil companies claim is just a generic one you’re throwing at him cause he’s a Republican, and I’m gonna need some proof regarding him lobbying and allowing legislation that would benefit oil companies.

1917 2018-01-31 20:26:01 Its much more than that but thats a fabulous start. Stop heating any liquid oil because that leads to oxidation + free radical formation. the only way to rid diseases is to cook instead with tropical oil ie. Coconut oil they contain #mcfa and that's a must.

1931 2018-01-31 20:24:25 Actually, most ICOs are backed by nothing. This one is allegedly backed by oil. The only problem is that the Venezuelan government is not credible. China will buy some of the tokens, but they'll do it essentially as a hedging contract and they'll likely pay in goods, not money.
1932 2018-01-31 20:24:12 Peppermint oil is actually very helpful for dogs. I use peppermint oil almost daily for my pups in homemade coconut oil treats with peppermint oil and blueberries. It is very important that it is 100% thereputic grade oil but otherwise it is completely healthy for your animal.
1933 2018-01-31 20:24:06 I disagree. Release the intel on how erodes family and cronies benefited from oil trade with daesh. Of course, that might not dissuade turks with how they are these days.

1951 2018-01-31 20:22:14 Why would anyone trust a government with "oil backed tokens" after they expropriated the assets of oil companies? Literally anything else would be more trustworthy.

1956 2018-01-31 20:21:41 The oil in Generac pressure washer should be changed after every 20 hours of usage. RT to spread this #MaintenanceTip
1957 2018-01-31 20:21:40 You forgot the oil part bro... 
1958 2018-01-31 20:21:36 should i get baby oil or olive oil?

1960 2018-01-31 20:21:21 I don't understand how they are taking this serious, I'm 100% sure they will let you cash out in bolivares only , a freaking bottle of water is more expensive than 1 oil barrel ffs.
1961 2018-01-31 20:21:12 Hahaha that's actually a really good point I didn't think of--though I think the way they make Nutella is adding palm oil to dried, processed hazelnuts, so it's not the nut oil that's present.
1962 2018-01-31 20:21:07 My friends down in Hawaii have some marijuana oil business thing going and he told me to come join . I’m seriously considering it
1963 2018-01-31 20:21:02 I use african black soap daily and coconut oil on my face occasionally and im fine
1964 2018-01-31 20:21:02 Thank you love  I recommend black castor oil and water! Drink water!!
1965 2018-01-31 20:20:53 Why so surprising? The US economy is 20 times as large as it was in 1968, at the time of the previous peak. Would be good to see this chart with oil production as a percentage of GDP.

1967 2018-01-31 20:20:45 I’m so happy my argan oil drops is for skin & hair 
1968 2018-01-31 20:20:41 What is the shelf life? Because what if you legalized it, resulting in the price is going way down, then the government buys up a lot of it, and just holds it?

The idea would be to bankrupt it due to low prices, just like we're doing with oil which precipitated Russia's crisis.
1969 2018-01-31 20:20:29 With all the natural hair revolution in Zed it would be awesome for someone to start an all Zambian hair care line. Not just some oil or butter. A whole line. Maybe me. 
1970 2018-01-31 20:20:25 Putting lavender oil here and there so I can sleep
1971 2018-01-31 20:20:22 Nah.  Boiled potato, hard boiled eggs, oil, lemon, vinegar, salt and black pepper.  Burp.
1972 2018-01-31 20:20:22 Boyce Watkins was denied tenure. Which resulted in him having to sell snake oil.

1974 2018-01-31 20:20:16 I can appreciate that one tweet. But the tag at the end of each of their tweets getting RTs simply for being a tweet would do so much more.

1975 2018-01-31 20:20:11 And it sucks that our stunning wildlife is at risk because of human greed. Any chance you could have a chat to your lady friend about putting the kibosh on oil drilling permits? #EndOil
1976 2018-01-31 20:20:11 Alberta should have actively and rigorously diversified its economy, starting years ago. The decline in oil prices and demand is not a sudden new change. I recognize that previous PC governments in AB grimly stuck to extractive industries.
1977 2018-01-31 20:20:01 Done smoking for awhile time to get this job in the oil fields and really stack these checks!!! Time for a change!!!
1978 2018-01-31 20:19:56 What do y’all honestly use coconut oil for? I’m sure the one jar I bought two years go somewhere under my bathroom sink
1979 2018-01-31 20:19:52 A classic! I have one mixed w/ peppermint oil and its amazing
1980 2018-01-31 20:19:44 Note my wording of *other* or additional substances in the “pure” oil, meaning to *further prevent* any harm to you or your animals. Have a good day
1981 2018-01-31 20:19:24 Yes. They are.

Not to mention it's not as if they shouldn't know that nuts are FULL OF OIL.

1993 2018-01-31 20:17:34 Read the article, the researchers were Spanish looking to improve sales of Spanish olive oil. Fake news
1994 2018-01-31 20:17:33 It feels good being all fancy and caring what you look like even though you’ll be covered in oil and grease by the end of the night.

1998 2018-01-31 20:17:23 If the #Fed wants to raise rates, it needs "official" inflation to rise to provide the excuse. How best to do that? Weaker dollar - check. Higher oil prices - check. Higher S&P - check. But that's just more conspiracy talk.

2004 2018-01-31 20:16:57 I assume that Corsi person gets paid real money for writing things like that and for being in the employ of a fake news organization. It's a shame. But then this country does have a long history of snake oil salesmen and suckers that will buy anything.

2006 2018-01-31 20:16:39 It’s no surprise Dr. D plans to continue his OM3. This is a meta-analysis showing dietary supplement fish oil and doses of RX OM3 that achieve sub-optimal plasma levels show no benefit for use.  He states he knows the dose he uses achieves a perfect OM3 index.

2009 2018-01-31 20:16:05 They been using Fracking water out west on crops because it was cheaper than water. The sickness of our food industry and political hacks undermining the FDA not to mention the gas and oil industry.
2010 2018-01-31 20:16:04 Apparently I missed it, but people are outraged that Nutella has so much oil in it? Has no one ever made frosting? It's just fat (often butter or cream cheese) and sugar. This is like being surprised that your chicken nuggets are MADE OF BIRDS!!!

2019 2018-01-31 20:14:37 Just follow the dollar. Oil will do the opposite. A hard asset like Gold. Just mho. Fundamental data just the catalyst for moves, not the direction.
2020 2018-01-31 20:14:37 Face wash for oily skin, a toner (prefer for oily skin as well, but honestly any toner will do), and a good sunscreen for daily skin. 

If you need some extra help with acne get something with salicylic acid (I use a liquid oil control before my toner... but there are creams -
2021 2018-01-31 20:14:30 Girl who changed my oil gave me $7 off even though it was a coupon for the more expensive oil that I didn’t get I will die for her 
2022 2018-01-31 20:14:23 They weren't poisoned by other chemicals. They were poisoned *by the tea tree oil* and you can't substitute quality of oil for knowledge of what's toxic, which is what your response implied.
2023 2018-01-31 20:14:21 @JillKassidyy is it wrong to be jealous of coconut oil on your snaps?
2024 2018-01-31 20:14:16 Let take example, do her children  go to better school than his brothers? Do they eat better meals than the large family? Let's assume she has only one kid, wonder why some people can't reason with their brains. So sad..
2025 2018-01-31 20:14:08 The White Paper quoted a wide range of projections, optimistic and pessimistic, and acknowledged volatility. 
But whichever was used, the oil was a bonus, not a foundation for the entire economy.
2026 2018-01-31 20:13:55 You’re welcome! If you have any coconut oil is also really good and a lot cheaper than body creams..xo
2027 2018-01-31 20:13:38 Don't worry, oil has a ways to go up in price before offshore drilling is viable again.
2028 2018-01-31 20:13:34 and if (when?) the commissioner tries to suggest doing this in the regular season, I'll oil up the torches and grab a pitchfork with everyone else. Right now, though, we aren't there yet.

2043 2018-01-31 20:12:20 But the nation's "green leader" definitely has the "greenest" worst air quality, just like its fracked oil is some of the "greenest" dirty crude in the U.S. It's great to live in such a "progressive" state, where #BigOil rules  under the helm of "climate leader" #JerryBrown.

2048 2018-01-31 20:11:30 I kinda think the cultural strip-mining of our times is inevitable in a system outfitted with Internet technology and driven by capitalist consumption. Always more profitable to extract the cultural product of the past like the oil of dead dinos than create something new.

2053 2018-01-31 20:11:04 I use soap with no sodium tallowate on my skin, oil my skin with tea tree oil.

2074 2018-01-31 20:07:34 This thread all started because of using tea tree oil *in a diffuser* & your claim that the problem is the purity of the oil is therefore both wrong & dangerous, right? No dilution will help & yes, I trust an actual poison control center over people selling a book.
2075 2018-01-31 20:07:26 .@EIAgov: Crude oil production hit 10 million barrels per day in November 2017; Texas was at just under 3.9 million barrels per day. #PermianBasin #OOTT
2076 2018-01-31 20:07:25 It can be the biggest oil field in the world; not worth a penny if it costs more to extract a barrel than the price you can sell it for. With shale oil now the swing producer, once it goes above $70 a barrel US production ramps up as it’s profitable (and prices stabilise)
2077 2018-01-31 20:07:15 Those statements are just a photo op for your fregging family. When peddling snake oil its good to remember it only works ONCE!!!
2078 2018-01-31 20:07:12 Major negative impacts on tax revenue from oil and gas come from end of field abandonment costs, reducing field production rate and much of the new discoveries being in harsher waters. There will still be revenue but how much is difficult to assess.

2091 2018-01-31 20:05:20 ....and maybe continue a commitment to maintain and clean air and water - you know environmental PROTECTION as stated in the name of the agency?  Hint - some of it has to do with eliminating our reliance on oil.

2096 2018-01-31 20:04:59 You CPC have a nerve talking about losing OIL jobs when you GAVE AWAY our farming and food production jobs. O_O
2097 2018-01-31 20:04:48 dont you know nipples leak oil when aroused
2098 2018-01-31 20:04:47 who wants to oil my scalp
2099 2018-01-31 20:04:42 I noticed matchday revenue was way down across all the clubs. I supported moving because FFP means unless you are bankrolled by a Gulf state or Oil gangster it was the best way to compete. What a mug.
2100 2018-01-31 20:04:28 #BellLetsTalk because three years ago bio oil was my bestfriend
2101 2018-01-31 20:04:23 # jet oil
2102 2018-01-31 20:04:10 The price of the oil has fallen and  the North Sea is a mature high cost region which is unlikely to provide substantial revenue in the future.

There is no oil so Scotland's financial future tied to the UK
2103 2018-01-31 20:04:10 It was the oil that greased the Aubameyang deal. Leaves us short in the EL though and I hate selling to the Chavs.
2104 2018-01-31 20:04:09 Don’t be silly. They’re best flash fried in coconut oil in a cast iron pan, with a dijon and honey mix sauce.
2105 2018-01-31 20:04:04 Stocks are falling quickly yet oil now rising after pit close. This tells me that money could be flowing from stocks to oil. The dumb dumbs are running wild. Nothing makes sense. No wonder Warren Buffett decided to expose MMs (as he did). They're dumb.
2106 2018-01-31 20:04:03 Low oil price

2107 2018-01-31 20:03:47 He saw the bigger picture; Catalan as an AfroEuropean vehicle for other oil ventures in Africa and was ready to follow his instincts but his management team didn't quite get that picture.
2108 2018-01-31 20:03:43 Yeah and Chavez  his political father used to  say he made oil barrel prices rise above 100 .
2109 2018-01-31 20:03:41 My brother had my car today to do my breaks, he checked the water & oil etc for me & my water was below minimum
2110 2018-01-31 20:03:40 I slipped on oil by the dish put and crash and burned 
2111 2018-01-31 20:03:38 Can't understand why oil is acting strong so far. Would have expected to dive today especially after the build.
2112 2018-01-31 20:03:22 Came back on Twitter to let you all know I rolled up to the gym in my hair oil mask thinking I’m some next don and I ran straight into the ladies section because I felt self conscious about the nourishing greasy expensive stuff in my hair that makes me look like I don’t wash :(
2113 2018-01-31 20:03:20 During my lunch, I run errands, take naps, get my oil changed, shop, etc 
2114 2018-01-31 20:03:06 I pray we dont loose this match
2115 2018-01-31 20:03:02 Russia - Putin reporting real GDP growth in 2017 of just 1.4% YOY. Disappointing given low base and recovering oil prices. Reflects impact of Western sanctions and Russian response which has been to keep fiscal and monetary policy very tight.
2116 2018-01-31 20:02:38 As a BC'er, it appalls me that eastern canada can drill for oil offshore, transport 5X more oil than the west coast, import 700K BPD of oil to eastern refineries .... while Alberta gets screwed.
2117 2018-01-31 20:02:29 Today, the auction for Round 2.4 #R2L4 for #mexico offshore Oil &  Gas fields was held. 29 Areas on Perdido, Mountain Range and Saline Basin areas participated.
2118 2018-01-31 20:02:28 I need to get up cause I needa go get my oil changed in my car
2119 2018-01-31 20:02:26 Another oil to be aware of is Lavender oil.  It is toxic for cats, but not dogs.  I use it to calm my dog, but can't anymore because it could harm my kitties.
2120 2018-01-31 20:02:24 I've also been using thyme & Eucalyptus oil in warm water. Listerine has both in its ingredients. It has been amazing.
2121 2018-01-31 20:02:17 We screamed bloody murder when Trump hired Tillerson to run the State Dept. But being so deeply invested in an oil company could certainly comprise one's decision making on environmental issues. We should hold our leaders to the same standard.

2126 2018-01-31 20:01:50 what are you talking about? america wouldn't be where it is today if ti wasn't "globalist" how do you think we became a world economic force? Trading amongst ourselves? The ignorance is painful. What do you think the oil and gas industry is? A local five and ten?you don't live in

2128 2018-01-31 20:01:34 ISIS wee created after Bush and Blair went in to Iraq and smashed the place up. Many founder members were Saddam's own personal guard who ransacked the palaces, got the gold then took over the oil fields, sold oil to Turkey etc. That's how they got funded.

2135 2018-01-31 20:01:06 They’ll try and get it in before the SBs come I bet to brag. Wouldn’t be shocked at U of PHX and Lucas Oil get one within 6 or 7 years.
2136 2018-01-31 20:00:58 I thought it was synthol oil haha
2137 2018-01-31 20:00:45 Oil prices settle higher as strong demand pull U.S. product-stocks lower

2144 2018-01-31 20:00:04 Failure to apply science in regulation of oil & gas production within BC is hypocrisy. Would it support fracking in each and every region? Can fugitive GHG emissions be measured honestly or fresh water protected from private diversions and other unregulated uses? #bcpoli #ableg

2152 2018-01-31 19:59:27 The Trump/Putin regime "takeover" is happening right in front of our eyes... First our justice system, nexts our FBI, our educational systems, our oil, our water, our land, our democracy and the literally the air we breath... This is what a dictatorship looks and feels like...
2153 2018-01-31 19:58:55 Like they used to do by buying the worst Crudes in the market or fuel oil from the state owned refineries like they used to do
2154 2018-01-31 19:58:36 It’s a 10 leave in conditioner & then Macadamia smoothing cream!! They’re life saviors, biosilk silk therapy oil is also one of my favorites

2164 2018-01-31 19:57:40 Changing oil is for peasant farmers
2165 2018-01-31 19:57:39 Nothing hurts worse than having oil being popped on you while you’re frying something 
2166 2018-01-31 19:57:38 Nothing in this house is safe I’m putting syrup on my waffles this morning an my roommate looks at me weird and goes “that’s hash oil syrup” WHY DONT WE LABLE THESE THINGS, now it’s noon and can’t get up off the couch and work.
2167 2018-01-31 19:57:37 Part 3 trillions of dollars a year in welfare to corporate welfare queens - banks, oil, coal, Comcast, electricity, Apple, Facebook, Google, prescription drugs, etc.  Over $100 billion probably been spent by federal government on prescription drug research since 1980.

2170 2018-01-31 19:56:53 So I finally took my car for an oil change today and while I’m waiting this old lady asks the guy to check and see if they found any spy listening devices attached under her car. They didn’t even try to hide how crazy they thought she was  she went on and on
2171 2018-01-31 19:56:50 Oh? I was thinking the other day that when Brexit finally happens, we can return to white oil paints that actually stays white.
2172 2018-01-31 19:56:44 Black xxs.... Arab oil perfume
2173 2018-01-31 19:56:41 so wtf is a “bria myles got somebody rubbing oil on her booty on ig type beat”??
2174 2018-01-31 19:56:39 They said that to me too I said nope oil only man
2175 2018-01-31 19:56:29 Also, if anyone told me when I was 25 that the NDP would be vigorously defending Alberta oil and gas and fighting with BC to put a pipeline IN:

Well, I'd have laughed my ass off.

We're in bizarro world now. Up is down, left is right, wheels are square...
2176 2018-01-31 19:56:00 What she loves is our oil. Stay classy @AmberRuddHR
2177 2018-01-31 19:55:34 In this photo I used @LoveLottabody Curl and Style Milk with Eco Styler Coconut Oil Gel

2181 2018-01-31 19:55:20 We only use peppermint and lavender because they are safe to use on pets. And I’m not sure why she’s freaking out about tea tree oil... vets recommend mixing it with coconut oil to use on dogs’ noses and paws when they get chapped in the winter... FAKE NEWS
2182 2018-01-31 19:55:12 Interesting that a tarif was slapped on solar maybe a deal with big oil?
2183 2018-01-31 19:55:00 Yes, & they leak oil & break down.  But there’s nothing like hearing your loud pipes roar “potato, potato,potato”
2184 2018-01-31 19:54:57 That's exactly what I mean the loss in oil relatively small amounts in comparison to the larger UK budget.
2185 2018-01-31 19:54:57 Deleted original post & posting corrected figures
At current oil price of $69 per barrel, from this single oil field BP will be taking $13.8 million out of Scottish waters every single day - over $5 billion per year.  - And that's just one oil field.
2186 2018-01-31 19:54:55 I wanna be at landmark already but instead I’m changing my oil and doing final interviews 
2187 2018-01-31 19:54:53 Moroccan oil dry shampoo is awesome! It’s a little expensive but so worth it! I use it everyday & only wash my hair like once a week.
2188 2018-01-31 19:54:45 Oil major Royal Dutch Shell said its U.S. unit had made one of its biggest oil discoveries in the past decade in the Whale deepwater well in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. The Whale is operated by Shell and co-owned by U.S. oil giant Chevron Corp.
2189 2018-01-31 19:54:36 Shut down science lab

Did they Put flour on squid?
2190 2018-01-31 19:54:31 I only have one question. Was he changing the oil on the Mustang and eating nachos with sour cream and then decided to give his speech?. That would explain the car and the white residue.
2191 2018-01-31 19:54:29 We used to travel down from Lancaster every other Saturday to the bridge to watch the #Chelsea and still put money in the oil drums #cfc #KTBFFH

2194 2018-01-31 19:54:00 One of my fucking biggest art pet peeves is when people draw characters with shiny nipples. Like.... have yall seen a nipple before? Theyre not shiny!!! Not unless the character in question is covered in oil or something.
2195 2018-01-31 19:53:45 So, not peak oil?

2197 2018-01-31 19:53:36 Opened my CBC news feed. Alberta to sue BC (over oil), RCMP faces 4,000 harassment claims and religious leaders to sue fed govt (over summer job funding). A society that spends the bulk of its time and money on legal action is becoming very dysfunctional IMO.
2198 2018-01-31 19:53:26 Well... there is the issue of Sask oil needing to flow somewhere... so... 
2199 2018-01-31 19:53:09 We could replace oil with hemp.....a biodegradable plastic, cheap fuel, many products such as paper& material like silk etc.... wood-like products ..the list goes on and on and it wont harm the planet.....
2200 2018-01-31 19:52:59 You bought it just like you bought Trump's con so you keep the dry beach and the snake oil.

2222 2018-01-31 19:49:43 USO right on the support line, people  on Twitter are shorting WTI. I’m still thinking it is not done yet although CL data shows production is increasing. Let’s give another 1-2weeks before it REALLY change the trend. $CL$Oil #crudeoil
2223 2018-01-31 19:49:39 I think it really depends on your skin. I put my oil on first or add it in with my moisturizer. I'm not an expert tho. Sometimes I add it after if I have set patches I want to address.
2224 2018-01-31 19:49:39 Coconut oil for the face??? People use that oil for cooking.

2228 2018-01-31 19:49:06 RIGHT? It's why pretty much every dreadnought by 1916 was switching over to oil power
Less manpower to work the burners, more efficient burn, and less toxic black smoke that would put a lot of sailors out of commission
2229 2018-01-31 19:49:01 @jaimebayly o quería dejar mal a poleo, o quería callar algunas verdades geopolíticas, lo cierto es que demostró una ignorancia supina sobre materia energética y su influencia en la geopolítica, quien crea que la era del petroleo ha terminado y que usa USA el oil esquisto es

2234 2018-01-31 19:48:08 I need to get a oil change my brakes done n a tune up .. I might as well go get a new car  that ride to aurora everyday is killin my baby 
2235 2018-01-31 19:48:05 That's because coal fired power plants kill a bunch of people every year. Renewables will be the cheapest form of energy in a few years. Whale oil will make a comeback before coal.
2236 2018-01-31 19:48:03 Compare it to olive oil!
2237 2018-01-31 19:48:02 Okay yeah that makes sense. I have tea tree oil body wash, I was worried for a second 
2238 2018-01-31 19:47:53 It's a 30 minute job. Any place can do it. Even oil change places (Speedy, Jiffy). 
Heck, even Ernie's car body and AC repair on the corner of anystreet. 

Do NOT wait. Get it done.
2239 2018-01-31 19:47:50 dude so easy. chick peas and olive oil - homemade you can add your own twist and what not.
2240 2018-01-31 19:47:48 Even though my oil seems to take hours before it sinks in?
2241 2018-01-31 19:47:43 Given that Canada seems intent on allowing others to take the market at least it’s in NA
We need all the oil we can get. 
Just look around you
2242 2018-01-31 19:47:42 Then you have Junior and his liberals regulations Canadian oil and gas out of business with their climate change religion downstream emissions new rules. Honorable mention goes to BC trying to move the goalposts on an already approved pipeline. Let's vote NDP and liberals out.

2244 2018-01-31 19:47:34 We can grow but can we export our oil is another question.  Maybe if the US sends their army corps to help build pipelines, that might help!
2245 2018-01-31 19:47:32 Okay.. you ready..

2246 2018-01-31 19:47:29 #WTI reflating against the $DXY rise.  Underlying fundamentals in the oil market are proving the key driver over COT and over-production fears.  No idea if it can hold up for the seasonal build period, but so far very determined longs are in control.  #OOTT
2247 2018-01-31 19:47:27 Let the US surge to 20 million barrels. Canada should concentrate on the development of green and sustainable energy sources.
As an after thought, I ask myself why so many barrels? How much oil does it take to fuel an army? Just saying.
2248 2018-01-31 19:47:11 That sounds like exactly what I want, thanks! I didn’t know they existed. Have any oil recommendations ?
2249 2018-01-31 19:47:10 Yes!  Full season!  Good luck in 2018 Jordan   Beautiful truck as well.  @Lucas_Oil and @BommaritoAuto have picked a really good driver who is great for the sport to get behind
2250 2018-01-31 19:46:49 I would love to help rub the oil all over ur breast, and give them a suck, 
2251 2018-01-31 19:46:33 Yessss and tj Maxx has vitamin c oil for like $6!!
2252 2018-01-31 19:46:33 Not that interesting, Wall would be doing the same. We are at war with the left coast which is holding us and Alberta ransom. We need our products to get to tide water! Oil is $66 a barrel but we have to sell for $37 because our options are limited by lefties and Liberal courts
2253 2018-01-31 19:46:32 I use pureology shampoo&conditioner. It’s wonderful. You really need to train your hair not to be washed everyday so it won’t produce as much oil. Batiste is the best dry shampoo and I use pureology dry conditioner
2254 2018-01-31 19:46:28 Not forgetting Tony Blair had boundaries moved in secret to deprive. Scotland from some of the oil fields.
2255 2018-01-31 19:46:25 Half the country already doesn't vote. That is how America got Drumpf, the candidate with the fewer popular votes, and a red tsunami in legislation whose mess will take generations to clean, IF it can be cleaned.

The solution to a house on fire isn't to shrug and add more oil.

2260 2018-01-31 19:45:36 Green DX is apparently fantastic for oil now. Looks like it may be trying to put in a H&S top.
2261 2018-01-31 19:45:34 I just wonder how much further along on climate change we would be if a decade hadn’t been spent saying “well we need to change as oil is running out, in fact it peaked a while ago and oil companies are lying”
2262 2018-01-31 19:45:27 I forgot that I get free oil changes for the first three years on the jeep and was a little to happy when the guy at Rouen reminded me 
2263 2018-01-31 19:44:58 I had 3 fish oil pills today and 2 after work yesterday.
2264 2018-01-31 19:44:51 what about the Kennedy who was making TV commercials for Hugo Chavez and commending him for his cheap heating oil?

2274 2018-01-31 19:43:42 I came here yesterday for an oil change and leaving. And now this.
2275 2018-01-31 19:43:42 Like, from what I've been told by an elected official who spoke to a rep from trans mountain is that oil by a twinned pipeline is an additional way to transport it from AB, not an "instead of by rail," issue. So we'll still have carloads of oil along the Fraser.

2300 2018-01-31 19:41:17 The most two factors which have highly impacted in dropping the oil price within last two days: increasing US inventories and some exporting countries didn’t respect OPEC’s agreement
2301 2018-01-31 19:41:14 I'd rather not explore a blog. I'd like to see a correlation of the more oil sent by pipeline to the decrease in oil by rail. Something from an oil producer. Because I think you're coming from a place of "truthiness," instead of fact.

2307 2018-01-31 19:40:44 Being vegan means constant worrying if your fries were fried in a different oil than meat.
2308 2018-01-31 19:40:42 I have done much work on the economics of energy production. When oil price fell oil revenues became almost zero because many fields shut down as mo longer viable. Of course technology will be developed over time to over come the difficulties of north sea but will need high price
2309 2018-01-31 19:40:36 So if this coin gets pumped the oil price goes up ?

2325 2018-01-31 19:39:16 And I think you're speaking from a point of "truthiness," or what feels true, instead of like a statement from oil producers that the increase in oil transported by pipeline will correlate in a decrease of oil transported by rail..which isn't true.

2368 2018-01-31 19:34:54 It may have under the sea but as he knows getting oil from under north sea is the most expensive field on the world and that viability of many oil fields are on a knife edge. Small falls in oil price can make it unviable. North sea needs high oil price - experts suggest unlikely

2381 2018-01-31 19:33:48 The ogx argan oil is the most moisturizing oil I've ever used on my low porosity hair. It's $6 and a little goes a long way. Smells great too 
2382 2018-01-31 19:33:46 except for oil coming into the east coast.
2383 2018-01-31 19:33:35 If oil based car companies and oil companies can sabotage the electric car, then who's to say it doesn't happen in other industries?
2384 2018-01-31 19:33:33 Only good entertainment can come from this project.

2390 2018-01-31 19:32:49 @leolithuania , this is the topic I qas referring to on the definition of what constitutes crude oil.
2391 2018-01-31 19:32:43 In Texas they stole black folks land using eminent domain laws knowing oil was underneath it in the ground.
2392 2018-01-31 19:32:42 So, ricin couldn't possibly be bad for you since castor plants are fine and castir oil is good fer what ails you!
2393 2018-01-31 19:32:40 Sadly it was well fettered by the USA and interference in their oil market.

2400 2018-01-31 19:31:39 A long time ago, I got an oil change. The guy tried telling me my oil pan was really rusted and I should get it replaced. I respectfully declined. Fast forward to today, and the same dealership tells me my oil pan has "a little rust, but it's nothing to worry about." #Racket
2401 2018-01-31 19:31:32 Also my stepmom makes a really yummy quinoa salad w cucumber, red onion, avo, tomatoes, and then lemon juice + vinegar + olive oil!

2410 2018-01-31 19:30:09 Just some random thoughts.  In my home, I have several interesting objects, from the oil lamp turned electric by my Great Grandmother to the electric lamp in a very interesting shade of glass grapes on copper wire hanging down...To a fountain pen holder of my Grandmothers.

2413 2018-01-31 19:29:59 Energy dominance: The US just topped 10 MBD for the first time since 1970... Jimmy Carter and liberals infamously called that peak in 1970 "peak oil".  It took 40 years, but Jimmy is wrong again.  Jimmy also predicted the world would be out of oil by 2012.
2414 2018-01-31 19:29:39 @AishaYesufu make your point and stop dragging his family into it,yes brandishing such weapons is utterly irresponsible, but dragging his family into it is utterly stupid of you,since you didnt see them begging on the streets.
2415 2018-01-31 19:29:34 2/ The oil industry itself caused the supply glut. It has responded by reducing labour costs (killing jobs) and seeking faster/cheaper ways to generate supply to sell. Hence, shale. The industry invented fracking and horizontal drilling and is now exploiting the techniques.
2416 2018-01-31 19:29:31 The lamp oil knows whats going on
2417 2018-01-31 19:29:23 Meanwhile, you pick Venezuela, which is a completely different scenario, as it relies almost entirely on oil for it's economic survival.
2418 2018-01-31 19:29:18 Why is everyone turning against coconut oil now
2419 2018-01-31 19:29:18 Matte foundations don’t even have me looking dry because I have oily skin and I also use a face oil which always makes me look glowy.

2421 2018-01-31 19:29:12 Homeopathy is a fraud. Snake oil. It should be made illegal as it only harms people by delaying care.
2422 2018-01-31 19:29:10 Oil prices are high now 68.7$ , one of the reason ...

2428 2018-01-31 19:28:32 It also sets the precedent to allow roads to be built through Native lands to transport oil and other natural resources. @SecretaryZinke you’re scum
2429 2018-01-31 19:28:31 Mahrez will probably leave for less money in the summer, but fair bloody play to the owners for not buckling to Oil City. Purposely bid low to unsettle the player, hoping we'll cave #lcfc

2435 2018-01-31 19:27:54 Dilute it with a few drops of olive oil or water - less burning :) I like to steam with two drops in a pot of water for congestion!
2436 2018-01-31 19:27:54 Hey @svenbiggs - Tar Sands isn't the correct term. That is a term used to generate misinformation and hate. It's Oil Sands. How can we take you seriously when you don't know the facts? Pipeline through Stanley Park? C'mon man!
2437 2018-01-31 19:27:38 We were an exporter of energy for years now.  Due to the tracking and new oil discoveries. We still do NOT export more than we import. And Trump opened a new avenue for foreign oil with the release if the Keystone Pipeline. More lies from our president.
2438 2018-01-31 19:27:33 Our houses and rents are still fairly high because of the oil fields and aren't looking to drop any time soon.
2439 2018-01-31 19:27:26 So, what will Brian’s contribution to village life (aka outrageous bribe) be? A tombola in the (contaminated) oil drum? Or a spot the (nuclear active) boil competition? #thearchers

2441 2018-01-31 19:27:13 The exodus is from the oil sands, which projects are long-term and mega-buck. The exodus is TO shale, which is why Duvernay and Montney are investment magnets, including by the majors that exited the oil sands. /2
2442 2018-01-31 19:26:42 PLOT TWIST, I got lazy and didn’t go for my oil change 
2443 2018-01-31 19:26:27 And if oil sands reserves are not burned out, then some other reserves will, maybe in Nigeria, or Saudi Arabia, or USA.

2448 2018-01-31 19:26:06 What the hell? These people are insane. “Vegetable oil is the worst!”
“Ewwwww wtf not sugar!”
“SKIM MILK POWDER?! Might as well be tar!!!!”
2449 2018-01-31 19:26:02 Relatives should be tarred and feathered and then virgin oil. Then they should be tortured.
2450 2018-01-31 19:25:49 LOL Just put the hot oil treatment in a mug, and pour hot water in while stirring (slowly, in increments, so you don’t end up making the treatment too watery).  When it turns into a pasty substance and cools down enough to touch, throw it in your hair for 20-30 min.
2451 2018-01-31 19:25:48 We know production is well over 10 million by now :)
2452 2018-01-31 19:25:48 walking around walmart looking sketchy af with my bookbag bcuz i didn’t wanna leave it in there while they change my oil

2454 2018-01-31 19:25:11 .@MikeSmythNews Please don't allow him to use the 'Tar Sands' BS. If he can't accurately name the Oil Sands how can we take him seriously?

2457 2018-01-31 19:25:06 I guess you never noticed the crash in oil prices hey Drew? Gee, for a sitting MLA you aren’t very observant! What you are saying then, it the crash in oil was the fault of an NDP govt that hadn’t even been elected? Albertans won’t be bs’d by your propaganda. Raise the bar? HAH!
2458 2018-01-31 19:25:02 Hopefully we can get that legislation Trump wants that allows for the patient to experiment with options. Cannabis oil will rock American healthcare.

2461 2018-01-31 19:24:50 Talking about how Kim Kardashian hired someone to oil her butt today made @lizz_mariee_ laugh so hard water came out of her nose. Keep it up Kim
2462 2018-01-31 19:24:50 Amazing what a difference 4 years make.
Remember now, If the next indyref is held within the next year or so.
We won't expect headlines from your organisation stating that Oil is to Run out in the next few years.
Just Saying!
2463 2018-01-31 19:24:42 Wow, how painful to watch. Garth I am available to do your presentations. You stumble way too much. You talk about BBI like its your own. Your not a used car dealer! You confuse everyone by going back and forth with between Oil and Gas and your love of your town! Crazy Wierd!
2464 2018-01-31 19:24:39 That's OK as long as it prevents Iran from exporting too much crude to make the Dakota and Arctic pipelines unprofitable.  Without those project$ there would be no kickbacks to the Trump cronies. The cold war was always about resources.
2465 2018-01-31 19:24:30 Idc what anyone says. Coconut oil DOES fix all my problems.
2466 2018-01-31 19:24:20 Brands have nothing to do with the oil itself being toxic to animals.
2467 2018-01-31 19:24:09 Rama, with two kidos in the house, I hope you got Seven Seas Cod syrup liver oil for the kids. The school going one will always come with something she may pick from school and share to the FAM. You adults will also need the same, and that garlic ginger mix. Best immunity boost
2468 2018-01-31 19:23:58 One of the shiftiest snake oil salesmen on feet. Good riddance.
2469 2018-01-31 19:23:54 however as a lot of intel gathered is for economic gain ( see USA intel gathering around the oil negotiations) they could choose not to share that
2470 2018-01-31 19:23:54 cc @LuParry Die "coconut oil hair mask"-deel het my dadelik aan jou laat dink.
2471 2018-01-31 19:23:53 @RachelNotley Where does #climatechange and the fact that Canada is totally failing in meeting #climate targets fit with expanding oil production via more pipelines? How will you justify your role to your kids when the planet is fried?
2472 2018-01-31 19:23:39 Fracking is no good from what data shows. Oil is not the future, it is just helping us get there

2480 2018-01-31 19:23:12 How much oil goes into making one of those electric vehicles? Not just the material and energy to built but mining of the rare elements.. unless bobcat has a solar panel division.   And 300 miles won't get much to van from Edmonton.
2481 2018-01-31 19:23:10 My mistake but Kinder Morgan has competition now so may have extra oil they can ship anyway

2483 2018-01-31 19:22:58 I’m about to fall out in this car I got the air on but this sun not playing man ....this dude need to hurry up and get done changing this oil
2484 2018-01-31 19:22:50 Do you know the name of that oil truck company?
2485 2018-01-31 19:22:45 Such childishness by the 20,000 will not change the fact the UK will never have an oil fund it would reveal the wealth that has been and continues to be squandered
2486 2018-01-31 19:22:42 Now that we are swimming in oil, why has the price of gas gone up 15% in three weeks..??
2487 2018-01-31 19:22:41 They gambled and lost.
Oil business is full of risks for everyone.
2488 2018-01-31 19:22:40 Does it make sense? Production increased by 1.0 in 2017...but now they project 1.0 mbd but in 2 years? Nah... It will be ok to hit 11mbd by 12/31/18.. we need this oil otherwise the draws will be twice the drop of 2017.
2489 2018-01-31 19:22:18 Though today I read about a type of aerogel (graphene-based?) which will return to its original shape, so you could use it for mopping up oil spills like a sponge.
2490 2018-01-31 19:22:09 It definitely could. With $64 oil, the sector should be ripping up, but it isn't. But maybe it is just lagging. Would definitely be easier to trade if we knew which one was not in gear. Grabbed some JAG and PE so far, you pulled the trigger and bought anything yet?
2491 2018-01-31 19:22:08 The Canadians sure know how to shoot themselves in the face.   Oh well let the other oil producing countries benefit from their silliness. $kmi
2492 2018-01-31 19:21:45 I had a horrible experience w my 100 lb dog coming in contact with a small dab of tea tree oil one evening. Next morning he was unable to walk. TERRIFYING. A trip to the vet, massive amounts of IV fluid & a good scrubbing later, he thankfully recovered. THIS IS A REAL THING.

2510 2018-01-31 19:20:02 I don’t get it? Speaking of jiffy lube, you need to get your oil changed.
2511 2018-01-31 19:20:01 Im never cooking plantain indecent again. I've caught one too many oil bullets to the chest
2512 2018-01-31 19:19:59 I used so much clove oil, I smell like a baked good.
2513 2018-01-31 19:19:55 It's still better than castor oil 
2514 2018-01-31 19:19:47 yo I found a coupon for a $50 oil change omg I’m so pressed I can’t wait until I get off
2515 2018-01-31 19:19:47 John West tuna , Brine, Sunflower oil  and Spring water
2516 2018-01-31 19:19:43 Not deep enough for steri strips. Coconut oil will help as will lavender essential oil. The cuts are just enough to relieve emotional pain. X
2517 2018-01-31 19:19:38 It would be better to have universal healthcare, intact Social Security & Medicare, lower gas & oil prices, less hungry children and better funding of our schools & education system, to be quite honest. I didn't feel taxes were too high
 But ins premiums & deductibles are.
2518 2018-01-31 19:19:37 Slicker than a can of oil
2519 2018-01-31 19:19:37 Albertans moving back home. Not gonna be like prior cycles though. Growth constrained and most oil sands projects are built with few plans to build more.
2520 2018-01-31 19:19:32 Ever sit back and think about the idea that entertainment is actually a major industry? We have the tech industry, the oil industry, and somehow folks making stuff up out of thin air made the list. Pretty cool when you think about it.
2521 2018-01-31 19:19:22 Here is my big questions at moment. With
1. US production increasing
2 Mexico refineries doubling runs in Q2
3. Venezuela falling
4 OPEC cut

Will there be enough heavy crude to mix with shale oil?
Will Canada grow enough?
Can US import enough heavy during driving season?

2523 2018-01-31 19:18:42 I support him not imposing sanctions, but they are not a threat. Maybe they are a threat to the USD by not wanting to trade oil for dollars, but they should have the right to trade as they please. Thats the price you pay for a fiat currency backed by empty promises. /1
2524 2018-01-31 19:18:38 Loool some of you guys’ beards have grown too long to suit your face’s shape. Like we get it. The castor oil worked. You’re in beard gang. It’s enough. 

Trimming your beard won’t lower your attractiveness.
2525 2018-01-31 19:18:35 Their temptation wand dabbed in oil paint twisted into their bat cave
2526 2018-01-31 19:18:31 They were funded by oil money obviously but these days the club is run off their own money that they've earned themselves, just deal with it
2527 2018-01-31 19:18:25 Here’s an idea. How about all the provinces that support the oil industry gets to divide the revenue from it. They (BC & QC)sure like the revenue, but hate it when it collides with their moral high ground!
2528 2018-01-31 19:18:25 Who owns oil in Norway?Statoil was formed by the 2007 merger of Statoil with the oil and gas division of Norsk Hydro.
2529 2018-01-31 19:18:24 It never fails everytime i come in here these people always tryna get me to get extra shit done to my car ... bitch just change my oil and give me my keys so I can go 
2530 2018-01-31 19:18:24 @AlbertaatNoon Rachel Notley speaks like @JustinTrudeau she has no care for the oil industry. Explain then why more rigs are going south?

2533 2018-01-31 19:18:22 Very thick! I just make sure I use mousse or oil before I left anything touch my edges now.  I now use gummy styling wax & it’s great. Thanks Hun 
2534 2018-01-31 19:18:20 Electronic Logs, President Trump has opened oil field production, we have waited a long time for this. The department of transportation is about to shut down this industry. Oil field trucking is different than UPS or Fedx

2536 2018-01-31 19:18:15 Coconut oil has done nothing but work wonders for me. Almost immediately moinsturizes my dry skin - ESPECIALLY on my face, conditions my hair & removes my makeup. I never break out either. 
2537 2018-01-31 19:18:11 I thought the oil was piped to the USA and piped back as jet fuel. Will check it out k
2538 2018-01-31 19:18:04 We are not dumb.Why do you think he blocked me as well? Let him burn the midnight oil for the enemy while...

2541 2018-01-31 19:17:56 Cracks need to go up before oil goes up I think

2546 2018-01-31 19:17:28 my brother's girlfriend got me roll on essential oils for Taiwan and I am obsessed. I am showering in this dreamy oil. #CalmandCollected
2547 2018-01-31 19:17:25 THERE'S A HOT OIL TREATMENT NOW!? MAN, MY STORE DOESN'T HAVE SHIT!
2548 2018-01-31 19:17:20 Meanwhile oil is gushing. One of the richest countries it makes me sick.
2549 2018-01-31 19:17:14 Jalepeno seeds and oil in a paper cut is, like, very painful, man.
2550 2018-01-31 19:17:12 "Try a bit of rice. It will help take some of the oil that carries the heat." She motioned, gently pushing forward a bowl of white rice, steamed and ready in a bowl.
2551 2018-01-31 19:16:45 So much for drain the swamp.  Wall street bankers and oil executives and ex lobbyists in charge.  Foxes in the hen house comes to mind.
2552 2018-01-31 19:16:44 I mean I only use coconut oil on my face to remove makeup. But everywhere else is lit. My fave is very temperamental
2553 2018-01-31 19:16:37 Laurent: fuck me dry
Damen: no *breaks lamp to use oil as lube*
Laurent’s heart: CODE RED CODE RED  HE CARES  HE IS GENTLE  I LOVE HIM 
2554 2018-01-31 19:16:27 Now you’re talking! I’ve got red skinny jeans with turn ups, no socks, a tweed blazer paired with full beard and horn rimmed specs.  I am going to smash the gala dinner at the annual cannabis and mental health summit in May.

2557 2018-01-31 19:15:59 To think someone is employed to oil Kim Ks buttocks! Where do I sign up 
2558 2018-01-31 19:15:58 Great interview.
It's not really the focus of the interview, so I'm not sure what makes Putin so weak here.  Not disagreeing but just would like to hear more.  I think oil and commodities at these levels have been a bailout for Putin.  Not to mention low interest rates.
2559 2018-01-31 19:15:57 This Puritanical policy happening in darts and now F1? Besides punishing the women involved by firing them for something that is about male attitudes, seems more aligned with satisfying certain Oil Rich sponsors than "political correctmess". #gridgirls
2560 2018-01-31 19:15:56 Yea I spent about 5 hours on the oil and 1 hour on the gouache
2561 2018-01-31 19:15:55 You make it sound like B.C. has no oil or TAR SANDS. Not said too be nasty k
2562 2018-01-31 19:15:50 i ordered the oil aayeeee

2568 2018-01-31 19:14:59 @AlbertaatNoon Why does no one ever point out the blatant hypocrisy of BC. Logging, mining, shipping, tourism, all their industry requires fossil fuels. They receive 100's of millions in oil royalties and maintain 10's of 1000's of km's of pipelines from their own oilfield
2569 2018-01-31 19:14:53 I miss your oil concoctions

2573 2018-01-31 19:14:36 Specifically, oil sands mines. It's a relatively high-cost form of oil production, and automation will improve the economics a bit. Probably not enough to make new investments in oil sands mines worthwhile, though
2574 2018-01-31 19:14:23 the squeaky wheel gets the oil
2575 2018-01-31 19:14:15 Trying to get my life together by chugging apple cider vinegar and smearing coconut oil on everything. Everything is still a dumpster fire, but my skin has never looked better. #HealthyLiving #Health #

2580 2018-01-31 19:13:15 #foodtip Sauté vegetables in oil before putting them into a soup. This will help seal in the flavor & keep the veggies firm.

2584 2018-01-31 19:13:00 The left should consider how much oil is integrated into our daily lives. It's not just fuel, all plastic like toothbrushes and lawn chairs
2585 2018-01-31 19:12:58 No, because Congress makes the laws that prevents people from doing things that can harm those without power.  Enron was a result of a lack of regulations on Corporate Finance.  The oil explosion from 2010 was a result of lack of regulations on drilling.
2586 2018-01-31 19:12:53 Oil first, corn second.
2587 2018-01-31 19:12:20 Forgiven. I was only pissing about.

2589 2018-01-31 19:12:07 What do people who believed peak oil conspiracies in the early 2000s believe now?
2590 2018-01-31 19:12:06 75% is the least!? @thehill is looking more and more like a snake oil salesman. Next you're going to try to sell us on the idea that McCabe wasn't forced out of the FBI due to his malfeasance. It was because he wanted to get a jump on his retirement.
2591 2018-01-31 19:12:05 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
2592 2018-01-31 19:11:59 so i just found out that english/american people actually fry their eggs in butter and not in oil and i just feel very confused
2593 2018-01-31 19:11:59 For the first time, Armies of India and Vietnam hold 6 day-long military exercise in MP. Vietnam is cooperating us in Maritime domain. They want to buy our Missiles. They invites us to invest in oil & natural gas sector in S China Sea. Vietnam is becoming India's next best friend
2594 2018-01-31 19:11:58 Dont hate on the sex work, hate on the economy.

There was a boom in that line of work after the recession.

Putting a moron coke head oil baby who couldnt even manage a baseball team in charge of the economy was a mistake
2595 2018-01-31 19:11:49 So much idiocy but liberalism is a mental disorder.
2596 2018-01-31 19:11:46 Yea. The only thing the usd has to really give it value is the OPEC oil purchasing.. We all know there's no gold backing, our debt to China, etc.. US gov will do whatever it takes to stop it and retain some value
2597 2018-01-31 19:11:43 F*CK YOU!! I HAD HIM IN MY FANTASY!! BLOODY HELL. SLIPPED ON OIL?!

2602 2018-01-31 19:11:10 Still find it difficult to believe you're a human with a family based on your sycophantic devotion to such a shabby human.

But, do tell how your beautiful clean man in the White House created those jobs for you.

Have you ever tried to steer an oil tanker? The economy is bigger.

2611 2018-01-31 19:10:04 The only thing is that fundamentals don’t support a large pullback in oil and  even less in a couple of month. Oil is now in a multi year bull market in my opinion. XOP should play catch up for most of the difference

If Permian shale not as economic as thought, won't prod'n ultimately underperform and shale oil prod'n miss forecasts? In which case, oil should be rallying?

2666 2018-01-31 19:04:22 Loved Steve Forbes comments on Apple retroactively slowing their phones. It was like a car dealer intentionally damaging your car, when you brought it in for an oil change. As Click n Clack used to say, "You want repeat business? Loosen da bolts."

Every time we force regimes change it never works out . Time to give up. .( they won’t cause they want oil)

2683 2018-01-31 19:02:19 So true but the U.S. needs to invest in the future not the past! We have to focus on innovation different ways to use power be it solar wind water hydrogen whatever... not to do so will hurt our progress! Remember the oil embargo need independence...

2689 2018-01-31 19:01:53 What the complete buffoon can’t grasp is that it’s not Scotland’s oil - that would have been the case, for most of it, if we had voted to separate- but we voted to remain as the UK

2697 2018-01-31 19:01:19 Maybe the phrase "big beautiful coal" is aimed at the Saudis. A signal that our dependency is going to continue to diminish. Makes me think back to the 70/80s when it seemed like oil would "run out".
2698 2018-01-31 19:01:08 When was your last oil change? Do you do them seasonally or by mileage?

2728 2018-01-31 18:58:26 While doing the research to protect its coast line and potential oil spill, BC should also do research when Cnd$ drops from 1.25 to .70 to US$, how much purchase power and oversea investment power its people & Canadian have lost.

2731 2018-01-31 18:58:21 Perhaps a joint conference in 2019? They could do a boutique lignin essential oil as conference swag.
2732 2018-01-31 18:58:14 It just depends. Everyone’s skin is different and different things work for everyone!! Coconut oil is the only thing that keeps my skin clear!
2733 2018-01-31 18:57:59 Not kidding, y'all. Put 3 drops of oil of oregano under your tongue and knock out your headache, or pre-cold and flu symptoms. It may burn the shit out of your mouth and make your tongue go numb for a moment but it's really worth it 
2734 2018-01-31 18:57:53 Man, that's clever. Doubling production in an industry that's running out of oil? Wonder if @RuthDavidsonMSP, @LabourRichard  or @willie_rennie can enlighten us how they do that. No? Maybe @BBCScotlandNews then?
2735 2018-01-31 18:57:42 It is all about parental choice and we choose that parents should choose an education that focuses on the glory of White Jesus (TM) and his greatest gift to mankind oil and coal.

2746 2018-01-31 18:57:00 I do and I can say that Alberta seems to swing from arrogance when oil prices are high and whinging entitlement when oil prices are low.

2753 2018-01-31 18:56:16 didn't oil production increase because of fracking technology? And wasn't it W and the GOP congress that spurred increased production, not Obama?
2754 2018-01-31 18:56:04 Still unknown who bought that 19% of Russian oil.  If Trump could get sanctions off,  Putin, Tillerson and Trump could make billions, if they are the anon. owners.

Both governments need to move beyond rhetoric and seize the opportunities #shqip
2803 2018-01-31 18:51:56 what was that about the oil sands creating jobs?
2804 2018-01-31 18:51:38 The other thing is the urea that is in our skin. If you'r asian or have a darker skin tone you have more urea and any oil works amazing with it! But not if you'r from Poland, Russia or other... :(

2813 2018-01-31 18:50:34 A Cooper (2015) Trump: “I’d bomb the hell out of the oil fields. I’d then get Exxon, I’d then get these great oil companies to go in, they would rebuild them so fast your head will spin.” A “ring” of U.S. troops would then surround the wells, protecting the oil companies." SICK!.

2821 2018-01-31 18:49:49 I exfoliate gently every day with the Frank Creamy Face Scrub. I'm wondering if maybe your toner is very astringent, could be leading to excess oil? I use a peel-off mask as well from time to time.
2822 2018-01-31 18:49:45 Last night we were in Comal County for the Republican Candidate Forum to inform voters of all the work @ChristiCraddick is doing for the state, and to ensure the oil and gas industry continues to grow! #KeepTexasRed

2832 2018-01-31 18:49:08 Economics 100 teaches us that oil is a global commodity that is traded therefore at market rates.  If Alberta “doubles or triples” the rate we will simply turn around and buy the oil at market rates from someone else. Such brinkmanship will do neither side any good...

2839 2018-01-31 18:48:46 As a matter of fact nearly 5 mill bbl per day do not qualify as WTI crude. Therefore just a little bit of more than 4 mill bbl per day of production can be used for transportation fuels, hence the soaring imports of real crude oil.

2848 2018-01-31 18:47:30 Absolutely. Black's premise was that it was transporting dilbit that  was the political poison pill here on the coast, but of course most people don't even realize how much refined oil gets shipped through the Salish Sea already.

2871 2018-01-31 18:44:52 Hedging is a 2-way street. Drilling services cost increase with higher oil prices. E&P has higher exposure to cost inflation but no appreciation from higher oil pricing.

2922 2018-01-31 18:38:34 So oil reached more than 10 million in November and then went on an 11 week binge draw while Cushing is still falling. And this is only January. So which sports curse should I bet on being broken this year, because everything is nuts? #OOTT

2925 2018-01-31 18:38:24 They are. My cousins had one when I was young and he was the sweetest thing. My friend's husband rescued one that someone dumped way out in the middle of nowhere on some oil leases. He was pretty bad off but he's a sweetie too. I've never heard anything bad about Boxers.
2926 2018-01-31 18:38:20 Oh, and while you are here, wanna remind me why you are fighting against a premier who is trying to get pipelines approved & built? Or do you only want pipelines if a Con approves them? You would rather shoot AB in the foot, than admit she is fighting for the oil industry.
2927 2018-01-31 18:38:19 Oh girl I learn my lesson about 100% tea tree oil when half of my face was swollen and itchy. A nightmare.
2928 2018-01-31 18:38:18 This was known to be going on at election time, yet nothing was done about it. Millions of foreign dollars are used to protest pipelines, oil sands,
and forestry designed to damage the Canadian economy.  Left wing groups want to end the energy industry and have us live in tents.
2929 2018-01-31 18:38:07 Wait. November got us to 10 million? How are we not crashing by now? Wow. Market is in dumb dumb mode.
2930 2018-01-31 18:37:54 Canadian market sinking while US market going to the moon. Oil rigs leaving Canada for Texas. Soup companies folding in Canada in preference to expanding USA production. Move fast or loose your ass.

2934 2018-01-31 18:37:34 Omfg oregano oil literally solves everything and I also learned that from you
2935 2018-01-31 18:37:30 Oil McBurnie
2936 2018-01-31 18:37:27 Unbelievable that British and their business partners could be so inhuman and heartless for such genocide going on in Biafra land and oil is their concern@radiobiafralive
2937 2018-01-31 18:37:19 For oily skinned people, moisturizing helps you stay LESS oily. 

Not moisturizing in a bid to make it less oily actually makes your skin produce more oil. This is because when the surface of the skin is dry, the brain signals the skin to secret more sebrum (oil)
2938 2018-01-31 18:37:16 Aw naw mair oil.
2939 2018-01-31 18:37:13 You know when you’re at the pool laying out and you put oil and sunscreen on. You’re out there for hours and when you finally come in your skin smells great and it’s nice and pink. Ya hurry up please.

2941 2018-01-31 18:37:08 Instead of taxing oil companies, the #akleg would rather pass the burden onto the elderly, disabled, and low income families in Alaska. That's our #SOTS
2942 2018-01-31 18:37:08 Coming from the mouth of a philandering, money-laundering snake oil salesman. Interesting. I know; why not #releasetheputintapes
2943 2018-01-31 18:36:54 #BellLetsTalk People peaceful Canadian To keep a lamp burning we have to keep putting oil in it!!!!!
2944 2018-01-31 18:36:42 The majority of us province wide aren't. It's the people in the lower mainland that are. Here in NEBC, where our oil and gas industry is, I feel comfadent that saying we are pissed off about this stunt too.
2945 2018-01-31 18:36:40 @Mahrez22 I think you need a new agent Habibi. We can do incredible things together. Call me  #AgentTalk #DeadlineDay
2946 2018-01-31 18:36:34 Soaking in epsom salt with some drops of lemongrass oil my sore muscles better start to feel better
2947 2018-01-31 18:36:31 Well deserved a lot of hard work you have came along way from the start
2948 2018-01-31 18:36:22 Trey Gowdy is going back to South Carolina where he will continue to style his hair like a cartoon baby and look like he just washed his face with olive oil. Congrats Trey. Big news.
2949 2018-01-31 18:36:17 No one wants to read your opinion in your blog . Anyone can google the evidence . You are saying no one died from USA and uk bombs when they bombed cities ? That’s silly . Everyone would be alive if Uk had not invaded . Full stop . Needless deaths in all sides for oil and power
2950 2018-01-31 18:36:17 @carlahall Ok I thought you at the Chew would be using Coconut Oil.

2952 2018-01-31 18:35:59 Anybody know any good beard oil/cream? I’m tired of my beard being patchy
2953 2018-01-31 18:35:58 My skin semi looks like yours atm. Mainly from scaring. My esthetician said drench the face in an oil & use a derma-roller. I got a $6 serum I love from Marshalls.
2954 2018-01-31 18:35:47 He’s a sleezebag selling snake oil
2955 2018-01-31 18:35:35 I just got online. EIA seems neutral kind off. So you're telling me that the markets care about products all of the sudden? The lunacy continues.
2956 2018-01-31 18:35:25 Oil and gas looks promising this year, so that means long nights and weekends for me. 
2957 2018-01-31 18:35:23 BMD, without a doubt. His affiliation with Chris Oil alone guarantees amoebic level IQ
2958 2018-01-31 18:35:20 Sky News: BP issued a statement saying the oil they've just discovered has suddenly gone missing and they fear it may be time to leave the North Sea forever. Very very soon. Could be as early as next weekend, depending on how soon they can get a hold of a van that's big enough.
2959 2018-01-31 18:35:14 I know, I know. For some reason, you think that the US will always want all our oil, and there is no need to look anywhere else for markets.
2960 2018-01-31 18:34:57 I've seen North sea oil tankers turn quicker than Kranjcar
2961 2018-01-31 18:34:40 oil > acrylic
2962 2018-01-31 18:34:24 I need like 10 cars to come get oil changes today by 6. Every customer you send me you’ll get 10$
2963 2018-01-31 18:34:23 Epsom salt & baby oil baths are divine 
2964 2018-01-31 18:34:04 @Ford @chevrolet y’all need to create a car/truck that never needed a oil change, because I’m tired of waiting hours in line at the dealer to get a oil change .
2965 2018-01-31 18:33:52 No the point is Norway's oil wealth goes to all the people. Here it just goes to multinational corps & the few they pay to rig to make them richer. Good thing the #swampcreatures just gave those corps a massive tax cut.
2966 2018-01-31 18:33:50 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
2967 2018-01-31 18:33:49 Good luck Rico and hammer down elbows up
2968 2018-01-31 18:33:49 We don't need ya dirty oil money! Our Thais have their own dirty cash. Run along now simmosleftpeg
2969 2018-01-31 18:33:44 Successful ELL circumlocution of the day: lard = "pork oil"
2970 2018-01-31 18:33:44 My grandmother told me there was oil of the coast of Cuba but it had too much sulfur which would make big expensive to refine.
2971 2018-01-31 18:33:36 Unfortunately, the oil and gas industry doesn’t give a damn about climate change. 

They care about quarterly returns.
2972 2018-01-31 18:33:28 Don?t fear saturated fat. High quality sources like coconut oil and grass fed beef are essential for good health.
2973 2018-01-31 18:33:21 Hey way to go!  You completely missed the point!
How many of those pipelines were built so Alberta could expand markets? 
If you would notice, those all go to existing US markets, which hasn't helped us with the downturn in oil prices, and doesn't help access other markets.
2974 2018-01-31 18:33:14 Look at that. Says right there, TransCanada KXL would carry crude oil from Alberta BC to Texas
2975 2018-01-31 18:33:07 I appreciate the oil spill on "see the ocean".
2976 2018-01-31 18:33:06 Possibly for Olive oil Giroud. Look at the brightside Coutinho is cup tied and Las Ramblas is nice this time of year. Couple days in Spain never hurt anyone
2977 2018-01-31 18:33:04 Paks are expensive AF! My almond oil I buy for £1 in burnt oak is £2.99 in Paks. Are they ok?
2978 2018-01-31 18:32:55 The oil price affects everyone. What's your point? Inflation is up higher than wages, so we get poorer. Those are facts.
2979 2018-01-31 18:32:52 Confusion over legalities of CBD oil continues as more & more bills pop up. It's currently on the shelves under an extension from Holcomb. But it's not permanently legal. A lot to keep up with. Hear from local people hoping to get some final resolutions at 5&6 on @wane15
2980 2018-01-31 18:32:52 I don’t rock with sesame oil
2981 2018-01-31 18:32:51 Show me a pic of the castor oil
2982 2018-01-31 18:32:40 lower income people (vote banks ) worries about increases in oil prices and Gas prices.
2983 2018-01-31 18:32:40 For the first time, Armies of India & Vietnam hold 6 day-long military exercise in MP. Vietnam is cooperating us in Maritime domain. They want to buy our Missiles. They invites us to invest in oil & natural gas sector in S.China Sea. Vietnam's becoming India's next best friend.!?
2984 2018-01-31 18:32:35 Exactly, he is nothing more than a snake oil salesmen, conman, grifter propped up by social media, Putin, and GOP greed.

2992 2018-01-31 18:31:55 Hey guise here’s a tip tea tree oil is an essential oil meaning it’s very strong and potent don’t slather your skin with it dilute it with a carrier oil (coconut Shea butter avocado or sweet almond oil) or just use it as a spot treatment
2993 2018-01-31 18:31:53 came to get a oil change and these dudes start cleaning my car, tf goin on
2994 2018-01-31 18:31:48 Believing climate change is a conspiracy being perpetrated by scientists & the oil companies are telling the truth  is fucking moronic
2995 2018-01-31 18:31:48 If you use vehicles you need fuel, oil, gas wells, refineries & pipelines.
2996 2018-01-31 18:31:44 That seriously looks like a black oil drum on his head.
2997 2018-01-31 18:31:41 Brynne, US basis weakening and WTI/CO tightening looks like the reverse of the beginning of the oil rally in July-Sep.  You seeing any reason for this?
2998 2018-01-31 18:31:41 Like most antivaxxers, @RealAlexJones is a shill for snake oil pseudo health products
2999 2018-01-31 18:31:36 No no no. Edges only. Moisturise edges with oil mixed with water. Ecostyler gel for life.
3000 2018-01-31 18:31:21 Here we have a very illustrative example of how ‘snake oil’ sales men operated a century ago, but set in a modern setting. No, people were not more stupid back then but fraudulent scum were just as convincing.
3001 2018-01-31 18:31:20 There’s only so much you can do while waiting for an oil change before you go crazy
3002 2018-01-31 18:31:19 Yes. I will never agree that the pipeline is not 4 Canadian crude oil. I will never agree that it would b scrapped if Trump didn’t sign EO.
3003 2018-01-31 18:31:16 Calolea's organic olive oil has been certified "extra virgin" by the COOC and has an acidity level of 0.13%.
3004 2018-01-31 18:31:08 Right! And they had a problem with asiago cheese bagels or rosemary and olive oil. I'd say my taste is pretty damn decent.
3005 2018-01-31 18:31:06 Government to built what again? If you need $6million to open the Legon health facility, why do you even fathom the building of a new Oil refinery facility? It seems there is something in just building facilities whether facility will be use or not. #CitiNewsroom @UmaruSanda
3006 2018-01-31 18:31:05 I recommend you olive oil and vitamin b12 supplements!

3008 2018-01-31 18:31:04 I purchased an oil diffuser and I love life 
3009 2018-01-31 18:31:01 Might as well say not to engage in the activity at all! But the tea tree oil tip could come in handy :)
3010 2018-01-31 18:30:40 OIL DIFF: 4.42 -> 4.49
3011 2018-01-31 18:30:34 Good advice because it would probably look like "mum oil pen ut Mitchell" instead of "LOL I'll own it Michael." HA!
3012 2018-01-31 18:30:20 I changed airliner at Dusseldorf airport to fly to London in early January 2018. The damn, mad German security check staff took my toothpaste, haircolour in tube and coconut oil in a jar. I am not a Muslim from south Asia or the ME. Comrades, boycott German airlines and products.
3013 2018-01-31 18:30:20 Instead of doing my bio reading I’m laughing at the word oil #college
3014 2018-01-31 18:30:06 HB 430 provides a necessary update to legislation that defines “production equipment” for the oil and gas regulation law. Vote YES on HB 430. #allforohio
3015 2018-01-31 18:30:06 If Jaitly could not clean up the mess when the Oil prices were 3rd of what the UPA had, I wonder if he would be able to clean up the so-called mess in his lifetime.

3017 2018-01-31 18:29:54 Dating a Married man is Fun untill you find out he saved your Number as "Engine Oil"s
3018 2018-01-31 18:29:53 2) crayon-y, faintly sweet, grassy or musty, or sawdust. If you get any of those, the oil is bad and should be thrown out. Good, fresh olive oil should be consumed within a year of the pressing and should smell/taste like fresh fruit or freshly cut grass.
3019 2018-01-31 18:29:49 US #oil output was growing at an amazing 1.2m b/d y-on-y rate in November. Even if December output stayed stable m-on-m, growth rate goes to 1.3m b/d #OOTT
3020 2018-01-31 18:29:47 Oh those almonds! And palm oil. Those Nutella riots in France: greatest ever oil grab in an urban setting. 30-40% of that chocolate spread is palm oil. Imagine giving that up! It's stupid and insane what we've come to like, in the name of habit and culture.
3021 2018-01-31 18:29:36 Totally agree
3022 2018-01-31 18:29:34 Castor Oil you bitch so strong 
3023 2018-01-31 18:29:27 That's fine. The fishing industry can't outspend the oil lobbyists. Case closed. That's how you #DrainTheSwamp
3024 2018-01-31 18:29:24 For the first time, Armies of India and Vietnam hold 6 day-long military exercise in MP. Vietnam is cooperating us in Maritime domain. They want to buy our Missiles. They invites us to invest in oil & natural gas sector in S China Sea. Vietnam is becoming India's next best friend
3025 2018-01-31 18:29:11 Yeah I do a lot of salads and supplement pretty much everything with olive oil... my usually go to for snacking is hard boiled eggs, tho. Super easy to find even on road trips bc truckers live off the things.
3026 2018-01-31 18:29:08 People need to understand that Trump is 100% willing to burn intel sources and methods and torch national security to cover up for his own crimes and treason. He is Saddam, burning the oil fields.
3027 2018-01-31 18:28:59 Two things that are good on their own don’t mix well... we are like oil & water ..
3028 2018-01-31 18:28:58 Final conclusion: I dislike anything that involves coconut oil 
3029 2018-01-31 18:28:49 RIP Joe Kennedy. Crushed underneath a Mustang while changing the oil.
3030 2018-01-31 18:28:27 I have a tiny bottle of tea tree oil I use on my face that I always keep in a high cabinet and throw anything I use with it (cotton balls) in the toilet. 
3031 2018-01-31 18:28:24 What to use in Lieu of Pesticides? Neem Oil, Garlic & Clove Oil, Azatrol, StrawFlower Extract... the list goes on!
3032 2018-01-31 18:28:07 He'll resurface as a lobbiest for big pharmacy, HC or oil company...just watch and see...
3033 2018-01-31 18:28:06 Do their best. Right you are. And the SNP and facts are like oil and water
3034 2018-01-31 18:27:42 Perfect! The ice caps are melting so let's take this opportunity to dig for more oil so we can help expedite the process! #greatidea
3035 2018-01-31 18:27:04 @CTVpolitics offshore oil belongs to the state, the Supreme Court decided it.they are trying to steal it through this scam.whataboutsolidmin
3036 2018-01-31 18:27:00 Oil changes last a few months. Tattoos last a life time.
3037 2018-01-31 18:26:47 So does anyone know how much money #bc would get in compensation for moving and taking all the enviro risks of 100"s of millions of barrels of "oil" a year?
 #bcpoli #abpoli
3038 2018-01-31 18:26:34 I need to get rid of an Ams Oil bypass kit for a 6.6 Duramax
3039 2018-01-31 18:26:32 If anything, I'm reading that fracking & shale processing has undermined the economy of physical deep coal mining. Fracking was initially a technique designed for the coal market, but was adapted by big oil. Hmmm where is Dick Cheney now?
3040 2018-01-31 18:26:30 Uncomfortability and growth don’t mix. They are like oil and water
3041 2018-01-31 18:26:22 Not a single gram of CO2, really? You realize that it is a energy intensive process to get from oil in the ground to plastic? Just like any other industrial process. Oil rigs, trucking, refineries, factories all produce CO2. You need to give this a bit more thought.
3042 2018-01-31 18:26:09 This energy is needed anyway, would you rather it be supplied by another nation at a higher price, the way it was from first oil crisis in the 70's?
3043 2018-01-31 18:25:55 Economic models aren't supposed to be impacted by political dismay. This wreaks of a snake oil economist.
3044 2018-01-31 18:25:48 I dumped my fish oil supps in favor of a pound of wild caught salmon per week plus sardines 2-3X per week.
3045 2018-01-31 18:25:46 Man city have oil money..they can buy any player for any amount why put out of Mahrez deal...they should paid the £95m
3046 2018-01-31 18:25:42 No, my wife was a hairstylist. Moroccan oil is tops.
3047 2018-01-31 18:25:40 เรื่องอย่ามองคนแค่ภายนอกนี่เป็นเรื่องเบสิคมาก ทุกคนก็รู้ แต่คนหลายในสังคนก็ยังไปตัดสินคนที่ภายนอกอยู่ดี
3048 2018-01-31 18:25:31 Yeah I read about this awhile back. I don’t use tea tree oil in the diffuser, only on my face so she should be good
3049 2018-01-31 18:25:29 For us from the Niger delta, offshore oil and gas to the federal govt. is a no no. We won't accept it.
3050 2018-01-31 18:25:26 I was going for speed in my search rather than quality of the chips.. oil must have been fresh
3051 2018-01-31 18:25:19 Darin Barney's article on "Who We Are and What We Do: Canada as a Pipeline Nation" in PETROCULTURES: OIL, POLITICS, CULTURE is very useful for seeing through some of the #abpoli claims re: coastal waters, BC jurisdiction, pipelines, "national interest," and jobsjobsjobs.
3052 2018-01-31 18:25:18 CBD oil definitely does help. Exercise is important also, but getting up for it is hard to do.
3053 2018-01-31 18:25:15 The NRA, Big Pharma, and oil.
3054 2018-01-31 18:25:14 Ahh, i dont know what you can do now other than applying drops of oil time to get them some moisture but if you get them cut, try to trim small parts every now and then while your hair grows. I used to have such bad ends but after trimming them regularly they stopped splitting
3055 2018-01-31 18:25:11 Took my baby to get a oil change
3056 2018-01-31 18:25:07 The KRG @PMBarzani has denied rumors that they agreed to give the oil to the SOMO.
3057 2018-01-31 18:25:02 IMPORTANT: any and every essential oil can be toxic to cats. It is VERY important to dilute oils (such as lavender) HEAVILY for them, just as you would for babies.
3058 2018-01-31 18:24:45 Are you scum not embarrassed after all the lies you told leading up the independence referendum, by saying the oil was running out. Westmonster Mouthpieces.
3059 2018-01-31 18:24:32 Use olive oil to masturbate.
3060 2018-01-31 18:24:25 I oil cleansed my face last night and between that and liquid exfoliation, I'm convinced that's the way to go.
3061 2018-01-31 18:24:23 okay. burping vitamin d and krill oil all morning is less fun than anticipated.
3062 2018-01-31 18:24:22 It’s frightening the siege mentality that Alberta and the multinational oil corporations are displaying.
3063 2018-01-31 18:23:44 Ev cost the same as a new car only with ev you don’t ever need tune up, oil change or frequent trips to the pump. It is soooo worth it.
3064 2018-01-31 18:23:42 “You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows” (Psalm 23:5 NIV).
3065 2018-01-31 18:23:41 @Rainbow6Game You guys should make a map in the middle of the ocean on a ship or a abandoned oil rig
3066 2018-01-31 18:23:37 The summary of it was he attempted to take the almost obsolete oil field of Chevron Netherland for 50 million dollars not for the oil but to use the name for business. Deal didn't go through though.

3069 2018-01-31 18:23:33 #oil reminding everyone (after those poor EIA numbers) that the only thing that matters right now is the #USD
3070 2018-01-31 18:23:33 Good! The quicker Canada and Alberta get out of the oil business the better.
3071 2018-01-31 18:23:32 @CTVpolitics #therestructuringdebate, the APC Recommendation is a scam regarding onshore/offshore oil, the Supreme Court decided this

3077 2018-01-31 18:23:04 What’s wrong with coconut oil?
3078 2018-01-31 18:22:59 Ahora los cubanoides importara "oil" de Argelia con dinero de Venezuela que robaron. Malditos asesinos pagarán por la destrucción que han hecho. Los personeros del régimen ahora planeando ir a disfrutar del latrocinio a Cuba pero los traicionaron igual y pagarán sus crímenes.
3079 2018-01-31 18:22:53 I would suggest you look at actions not words. In the coming days , your air and water are less protected , our National parks are going to be oil fields while the oceans now that safeguards have been lifted will be black with oil!

3086 2018-01-31 18:22:12 So, it doesn’t transport crude oil from Canada? I bet u think they r using US steel. I also bet u think the EO was the last word on it. Lol
3087 2018-01-31 18:22:04 Honestly, I hate oil. It feels like a curse. We see no benefit, watch as they piss it up against a wall & ensures that they will never let us go.
3088 2018-01-31 18:21:57 When oil prices go up, users have to pay. Unfortunately There in no shrines for government to raise revenues to run this country.

3091 2018-01-31 18:21:50 Coconut oil isn't supposed to be used as a cleanser dummies it's just supposed to be something natural to take off your makeup.
3092 2018-01-31 18:21:46 Fair! I've never really figured out a way to prevent or fix it other than "give tidier blowjobs" and "treat acne with tea tree oil" and one of those definitely ain't gonna happen.

I made you in the color of oil,
the black gold which keeps people warm.
3117 2018-01-31 18:19:06 It does sound bonkers to risk such a facility on the edge of a city. Like building a potentially explosive oil upgrader on the outskirts of a neighbourhood. Oh, wait...

3137 2018-01-31 18:16:54 Somehow my Twitter didn't informed me about your message... the reason I am interested in the balm is, that I also want to use it for my dry skin. Already got old money oil from a store in Germany and ordered some things in your website this weekend. Still waiting for the balm...
3138 2018-01-31 18:16:49 How much did Norway make last year from oil , when the UK government said they earned nothing? There's a black hole because Westminster is mismanaged vital industries for decades, not allowing scot gov to nationalise oil and gas for example or railways.
3139 2018-01-31 18:16:46 You must try this to reduce the effects and duration of a cold. 5 drops of oil of oregano under the tongue-hold for 1 or 2 minutes, then swallow with water, twice / day

3142 2018-01-31 18:16:24 Well. The NDP didn’t take blame when the price of oil dropped substantially 3 yrs ago (as they shouldn’t ) so We shouldn’t praise them and give them the credit when the price of oil rebounds and companies react to market.  This start up has nothing to do with political parties.
3143 2018-01-31 18:16:09 If I knew the answer to that one I'd be really rich LOL. Historically, they have run at a certain ratio against each other, but now that ratio is really stretched beyond the norm. One of them is mispriced, but I wish I knew which one. My guess is oil is priced to high.

3153 2018-01-31 18:14:45 & what % of Americans get those oil rig jobs?
3154 2018-01-31 18:14:42 We realize, of course, that very few in the U.S. government are contemplating this step. It would be a difficult and costly one on both sides. Citgo—the Houston-based subsidiary of PDVSA, Venezuela’s national oil company—would in effect be shut down, costing thousands of jobs.
3155 2018-01-31 18:14:40 only because the price went from 16 bucks to 60 bucks. they own 60% of the oil company. Not possible or going to happen in Scotland. So forget oil and look at scotland without oil and without barnet formula. Can we as a country make what we need? When we can I'll vote for it.

3164 2018-01-31 18:13:31 Changing leaders doesn't change the fact that B.C. doesn't want anything to do with oil/pipelines. I just don't see how a change in gov't. will change that but you never know I guess.

3190 2018-01-31 18:11:05 Yup. But it’s all about risk vs reward. I worked resource sector for 20 years. Pipelines fail, Equipment fails and the environment suffers.

3205 2018-01-31 18:10:01 Impose the right gas flare penalty, thereby making gas flaring as not an alternative nd companies will comply

Companies know which side their bread is buttered
3206 2018-01-31 18:09:51 Raro que #México produzca #petróleo #oil, lo venda al exterior, después lo compre como gasolinas y otros combustibles, y nuestras refinerías estén subutilizadas, con la historia de que no están hechas para el tipo de crudo que se extrae en el país. ¿Raro, no?

3316 2018-01-31 18:00:44 It only makes logical sense as oil isn't an infinite resource. I'd wager that, eventually, something like Forumla E will take Formula 1's place as oil gets far too expensive to use or the market demands more eco-friendly vehicles.

3320 2018-01-31 18:00:32 In 2015 Norway and Scotland's waters produced roughly the same amount of crude oil, and Norway received £9.7bn in revenue whilst Scotland received £60m. 

Norway makes use of its surplus and allows it to be reinvested into the country to be spent on infrastructure etc.

3360 2018-01-31 17:55:46 $XOP about a month ago I did a XOP/WTI ratio for the last 2.5 years. That ratio avg about 1.25 over that time ranging from 1.08 to about 1.62. Today with oil at 64.30 and the XOP at 36.63, that ratio now stands at the highest since 2015 at 1.76. At 1.25, the XOP should be ~51

3362 2018-01-31 17:55:42 They declare sections of the same oil field every so often as new finds so they pay less in tax

3366 2018-01-31 17:54:58 Tissue oil body scrub from Justine I love it works wonders plus it moistures your skin.
3367 2018-01-31 17:54:56 Russia does not have enough leverage to solve this issue. They are waisting resources on wrong priorities. They may concentrate on solving massive internal issues esp economy and less oil dependence.

Or it could be a film of gun oil due to her Armageddon mental illness thoughts...

3369 2018-01-31 17:54:42 @love_prezzo Ordered your low calorie spicy pesto penne pasta with prawns today and it had about 2 TBS of oil underneath! When I pointed this out to  a staff member she just gave me a blank look. Very disappointing! #PrezzoNottingham
3370 2018-01-31 17:54:42 I believe the oil they are in search/need of has everything to do with Putin as I did in the beginning. Still why I believe Tillerson got his position.
3371 2018-01-31 17:54:28 When I use coconut oil my skin feels extra dry 
3372 2018-01-31 17:54:20 Working at the Wadena gas bar, working the pumps and a customer comes up. He looks over to his wife and says “I guess they do have women working here.” Then he asked me if I could check his oil and if I knew what a dipstick was..... as 90% of my coworkers are female 
3373 2018-01-31 17:54:04 Having a car is fun and all that but emissions tests and oil changes and just overall maintenance is ANNOYING
3374 2018-01-31 17:54:00 The key to my EXCESSIVE HAIR GROWTH IS OLIVE OIL AND CUTTING A Centimeter every 3 wks/1Mth!

3377 2018-01-31 17:53:36 Weeping for all life on Earth. Don't know her background, but let me just guess, campaign donations for whatever she did before came from Big Oil, coal or other known polluters.
3378 2018-01-31 17:53:35 Alaskans own 1,205,532 shares of STATOIL ASA, worth $20,590,709. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in NORWAY.
3379 2018-01-31 17:53:24 He said "a good omelette doesn't need oil to come out well"
I was like, okay, show me then, ended up trying to scratch the omlette out of the pan and ruining it completely, NO FOOD NO PAN T_T
3380 2018-01-31 17:53:15 should this include roads, oil delivery, gasoline stations, no septic systems, petroleum usage by others etc??   Just asking?  that would be watershed management and part of source water protection -
3381 2018-01-31 17:53:10 Still can buy the oil at pep boys for less than $20 and spend 19.99 on an oil change when you bring the oil
3382 2018-01-31 17:53:07 My Personality is 1/2 Snake Oil Medicine Show and 1/2 Lube Royale.
3383 2018-01-31 17:53:04 SNP = Snake oil salesmen - No Politics
3384 2018-01-31 17:52:58 Certainly looks more interesting than oil.
3385 2018-01-31 17:52:57 No I never heard of that! I read to put a small amount vaseline on their paw but that weirded me out but I can try the coconut oil cause at least that’s all natural
3386 2018-01-31 17:52:43 For those “praying for us” trying the oil cleansing method saying “invest in skincare”.. don’t think for 1 second i haven’t already been to a dermatologist and tried every face wash on the earth. This is the one thing actually improving my skin unless it’s all your prayers
3387 2018-01-31 17:52:38 I just ran all hot water , then I put a handful of coconut oil in the water. Stir it until it dissolves.
3388 2018-01-31 17:52:37 Is it not smarter for oil companies to invest in renewables? But I'm sure their greedy shortsightedness is stopping that.
3389 2018-01-31 17:52:22 I have sling shot.....British Columbians need to stop being so apathetic and speak up for industry. They NEED our Oil & Gas for shipping, Ports,boats, Airplanes, trucking transports of goods? Ashphalt for roads and roofing is basically bitumen so remove all of that?#hippiecrites
3390 2018-01-31 17:52:21 So far, international oil giants seem not to worry about the possible outcome of Mexican Presidential elections this year. A good sign, certainly. #R2L4 #EnergyMexico #EnergyMexico2018

3393 2018-01-31 17:51:41 i’ve been making my “gold oil” for over a year now. I derived it from homemade baby oil & added natural oils that promote elasticity and healthy skin for aging
 anytime i try to use something from the store-my face hates me

natural is the way to go
3394 2018-01-31 17:51:39 Y’all don’t use coconut oil??? 
3395 2018-01-31 17:51:16 A bong! Am goin on CBD Oil, bong the fkk out it! Or get a pipe? No sure lmbo

3397 2018-01-31 17:51:11 Marinade your chicken in olive oil, orange juice, lemon juice &amp; pepper. Healthy can be delicious.
3398 2018-01-31 17:51:11 1/ Meanwhile the USSR is gone. China is a a fascist state and all there is left is a coconut laden tourist destination south of Miami and a oil rich country in S.America where the citizens are about to delve into cannibalism.
3399 2018-01-31 17:51:10 Told my boyfriends ex she probably would've still had him if she used oil moisturizer on her hair. Ever since that day her hair been shining in the day and night

3402 2018-01-31 17:50:33 Getting an oil change is such a hasssslleeeee. 
3403 2018-01-31 17:50:27 The oil industry is booming again as nigeria awaits the biggest FPSO on Nigerian water
3404 2018-01-31 17:50:23 The Yes campaign predictions, especially about oil, were farcical, the thing is the KNEW and lied to you. If I was you, I'd be pissed at them.
3405 2018-01-31 17:50:20 Es increíble justificar darle el poder a AMLO por lo malo que han hecho los demás partidos. No sólo enfoca las campañas en lo negativo (y todos, hasta los peores, han hecho algo de bueno) sino que lo libera de dar alguna propuesta concreta/realista.
3406 2018-01-31 17:50:16 Logic the type of dude that bathes in crude oil
3407 2018-01-31 17:50:07 My garden is not spacious enough.. for barrels of oil :-)
3408 2018-01-31 17:50:04 But but what about fully electric by 2030. We don't need dirty oil.
3409 2018-01-31 17:50:03 well I’d try raw unrefined shea butter if you don’t mess w/ oils but Vitamin E oil is also very good, and I’d try bahi cosmetics they shit is fire fr..
3410 2018-01-31 17:49:58 I’m excited for my 2 weeks off. I’m going to try oil pulling
3411 2018-01-31 17:49:46 @VinnieTortorich @AnnaVocino If it comes to choosing where to put my money (olive oil or rib eyes) im going to choose rib-eyes. Is there a store bought olive oil that you would recommend that you can get from Sprouts or even Thrive Market?
3412 2018-01-31 17:49:40 Sad for you but after Obama sold off all our oil stockade and pocketed the money .And laid off all oil Industyso he can make money  Iranians
3413 2018-01-31 17:49:31 "There's a whole ocean of oil under our feet, and no one can get at it but me"
3414 2018-01-31 17:49:29 Getting my oil changed and I hear the guy ask “have any suggestions?” I have one, hurry the fuck up.

3418 2018-01-31 17:49:00 オイルだからってオイルツイートばかりな訳じゃないぞ。油ツイートもするよ。
3419 2018-01-31 17:48:59 You're right, oil and water do not mix (well they do but we won't go in to that now). We've already established that you're the one who finds things complicated; such as spelling.
3420 2018-01-31 17:48:51 shits no joke I don’t fuck w oil diffusers for this very reason
3421 2018-01-31 17:48:44 Gonna adult so hard after work y’all. Bank, oil change, fill up my tank, and grocery store

3425 2018-01-31 17:48:22 It's not all about the Oil, it's about Scotland's future in general.
What happens when the next excess resource is pillaged/wasted e.g. renewable energy generation(massive potential), carbon capture and reuse etc.
There's also the environment...
Scotland should have control.
3426 2018-01-31 17:48:21 I love coconut oil so much. It just does wonders to my skin! 
3427 2018-01-31 17:48:18 I only use tea tree oil topically, I don't diffuse it! But I know there's a LOT of conflicting research and opinions from vets on oils and pets I never let my pets near my oils and I diffuse in LARGE amounts of water so it's diluted

3446 2018-01-31 17:45:51 My skin is so dry I need to sit in a tub filled with coconut oil
3447 2018-01-31 17:45:46 Mix 3 pints buritto with 1 cup cereal. Add Olive Oil. Drain through cheesecloth Serve over kale.
3448 2018-01-31 17:45:42 Tillerson positioning himself to be the oil oligarch in the US.
3449 2018-01-31 17:45:28 Yup. That would do it. I do pay more for olive oil than most, but I can buy fresh pressed. Soooo, amazing.
3450 2018-01-31 17:45:04 I personally hate coconut oil... Don't get the appeal at all
3451 2018-01-31 17:44:56 Still,,remain bearish crude oil.

3454 2018-01-31 17:44:47 Extra fund from the sales of crude oil should be used in funding the constructions of homes. 
Removal of taxes on building materials for specific years to allow for low cost housing.
3455 2018-01-31 17:44:45 Note to self  never pop popcorn with Olive Oil 
3456 2018-01-31 17:44:40 2 cup fills of chicken, 2 cup fills of kale, 1 celery, 1 sweet potato, tablespoon garlic olive oil, oregano, cumin and knorr chicken stock cube all cooked in my new soup maker

3461 2018-01-31 17:44:21 If you have an oil diffuser, I highly suggest sandalwood 
3462 2018-01-31 17:44:08 ...to bestow on them a crown of beauty instead of ashes, the oil of joy instead of mourning, and a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair. They will be called oaks of righteousness, a planting of the Lord for the display of his splendor.

3472 2018-01-31 17:43:06 Go for it. It makes a mockery of "pooling and sharing" which is the most ridiculous and oft repeated baws in Scottish politics.
Anl invention of the unionists. Our oil & gas was pooled and shared in the same way as my last mobile was pooled and shared by some radge

3476 2018-01-31 17:42:46 You obviously don’t do finance. Separation from the uk would be incredibly harmful at the moment. Why the insult Kim? Lied to re Oil? Are u kiddin? Vow, that was something the daily record came up with and the Smith comm had SNP involved. U obviously don’t understand the figures.
3477 2018-01-31 17:42:38 We have British rape seed oil and through the summer actions many farms in the UK we see rape seed all the time so I suppose this is why as well as supermarket Aldi who undercut everyone

3493 2018-01-31 17:41:09 So many things Trump took credit for in the #SOTU were well underway during the Obama years. Rise in US natural gas and oil production, less unemployment, etc. But his supporters won't fact check this. They've been conditioned to trust Trump. Everything else is fake news. 
3494 2018-01-31 17:41:03 People pray  for cake ... but when the almighty gives them eggs , oil , butter , batter , a pan & an oven they get frustrated and walk out the kitchen
3495 2018-01-31 17:41:02 “The dose makes the poison” right? concentrated tea tree oil kills us too, but dilutions are beneficial topically. May be true for the eggs too, but what’s the min dose to impact fungus? That I don’t know. So many active compounds in the oil, hard to quantify between batches :/

3503 2018-01-31 17:40:21 You can be sure it will be somewhere with oil & resources, but no nuclear arms. Probably the middle East again. Iran looks ripe for the picking on.

3505 2018-01-31 17:40:02 Can you even call someone perfect without sounding ironic?
3506 2018-01-31 17:39:59 Natural: lemon juice, salt or sugar scrubs, rose hip oil, honey. These work but take a looong time (I use Lush Ocean Salt and Full of Grace). Wear sunscreen on your spots even in Winter so they don't get darker

3519 2018-01-31 17:38:10 As a food inquisitor, I'll be curious to see why this is switched here. Is rape seed oil produced near you? This would be £5.49 here, slightly larger bottle, IF I can get it. Huh.

3522 2018-01-31 17:37:56 The Democratic party has basically become Neo-conservatives: beholden to corporate interests like pharmaceutical, oil and energy, defense, etc. Many top recipients from these industries are now "democrats". HRC openly supported fracking, the Keystone pipeline, banking dereg.. .

3529 2018-01-31 17:36:42 If Trump wasn't as divisive as he is I'd support him, but he's a very negative person, by listening to him no one is greater or smarter than he is, that's not how a president speaks that's how a snake oil salesman speaks
3530 2018-01-31 17:36:33 This oil pen and coffee burp mix smells like cup noodles 
3531 2018-01-31 17:36:31 Look at that! It's gorgeous! Now it needs you holding a checkered flag out the window.

3538 2018-01-31 17:35:57 Hopefully the club will brief you that we told him not to come in to training and that he wouldn’t be considered for tonight whilst this was ongoing. That his transfer request was just him voiding his loyalty bonus to oil the wheels of any deal ..........  not !
3539 2018-01-31 17:35:55 I JUST started using castor oil on my brows. I used to use coconut oil but it didn’t do much but make but make them shine lol. But I moisturize my hair and put the coconut oil on last to seal in the moisture

3545 2018-01-31 17:34:37 If you’re having trouble with trying to eat right start the “Crowding Out Process”. 

Eat what ever you want but do this first...

1. Eat 2 cups of green veggies with every meal. 
2. Eat a small slice of bread with a table spoon of olive oil. 
3. Drink 8oz glass of water.

3547 2018-01-31 17:34:17 2: Trump State of Union address:
Never called upon oil companies to help pay for Harvey;
never mentioned poverty despite Americans averaging $300 in the bank, living from hand to mouth;
never mentioned how Opioid addiction pushed by drug companies is treated vs. other addictions
3548 2018-01-31 17:34:12 why backed by #OIL ? just tokenize OIL directly
3549 2018-01-31 17:34:08 So the energy and environment implications of oil extraction and refinement, and then of the manufacture process for these products is ok? I thought this was about reducing our dependency on fossil fuels.
3550 2018-01-31 17:34:05 It’s Oil. Better off gambling in the ST. Buy this the fuck up for the LT
3551 2018-01-31 17:34:04 Make your unbelievably shiny tresses? Hair oil!
3552 2018-01-31 17:33:58 Whenever I see, "thank you for your service", I see a shadowy figure with oil stains on his hands, a dollar bag and a GOP lapel pin cackling in the background.
3553 2018-01-31 17:33:57 Tee tree oil is made by the eucalyptus to poison insects (et al), so without knowing the permeability of the eggs, sounds scary. We use athletes foot powder on python eggs with no ill effects; targets fungi at least

3555 2018-01-31 17:33:40 Lucas Oil Stadium seats 70k, so it seems ludicrous on its face that hosting the Super Bowl could generate 3x that number of *additional* hotel bookings over baseline for that time of year

3557 2018-01-31 17:33:18 so i started drinking olive oil in the mornings, and my hair is growing like crazy 
3558 2018-01-31 17:33:14 from what I've read, the mafias of Greece, Italy and Spain skim so much real olive oil off the top and add canola oil instead, that no one has had "real" olive oil in a while >_>
3559 2018-01-31 17:33:07 Just got off the phone to president Maduro of Venezuela. 

He’s happy for us to participate in the $PETRO Pre sale this Feb 20!

3560 2018-01-31 17:32:45 Hmm! That ermine-gland oil in my six brothers, yeah, yeah.
3561 2018-01-31 17:32:45 I’m allergic to tea tree oil so my body must just be smart and know it’s true evil
3562 2018-01-31 17:32:40 Leaders have been selling us out 4 years. Campaign finance reform, gerrymandering reform, accountability, and ethics are what most Americans need in DC. Sadly this has left people ripe for buying snake oil peddled by a con man. Understand the desperation but this was predictable.
3563 2018-01-31 17:32:08 At least the Thatcher government understood not to start  a military conflict in a nuclear hot spot zone - they were more interested in potential oil reserves.
3564 2018-01-31 17:32:05 lmaoooooo, my cousin just tried avoiding school tomorrow & Friday by saying his stomach hurts and his mom said "i'll give u castor oil, you'll be fine by Friday" 
3565 2018-01-31 17:31:58 I read about advances in energy tech, then look out my window & see heating oil delivery trucks. They're pumping oil into basement tanks. In another month, they'll be back to refill. #reallife #notsoadvanced
3566 2018-01-31 17:31:53 US wage increases will rise as the USD falls.  If what I'm describing is even close to true, the USD is not priced in the correct ZIP code to where it must eventually fall.  When USD collapsed v. oil 04-08, it was good for US, US wages (shale).  Same will happen more broadly
3567 2018-01-31 17:31:40 Today only we had a news report showing test use of ethanol based autorickshaws with Mr Gadkari and Nitish Kumar riding it. Govt looks serious in using ethanol as alternate fuel till solar takes over. #India #Oil 

And what that means in long run for #USDINR ... well... guess 
3568 2018-01-31 17:31:30 Let me be clear on this: oil companies willing to succeed in Mexico, ought to develop their own operational/political risk intelligence systems. #R2L4 #Ronda2 #EnergyMexico #EnergyMexico2018

3571 2018-01-31 17:31:06 King Agadja (1708–1740) attempted to end the slave trade by keeping the slaves on plantations producing palm oil, but the European profits on slaves and Dahomey's dependency on firearms were too great
-Shillington, 2005, pg191
3572 2018-01-31 17:31:05 I put coconut oil on my face and it doesn’t break out.

3574 2018-01-31 17:30:50 oil prices are up, Russia isn't exposed to the same vulnerabilities; secondly, FVEY has the wrong mental model; and...I have my reasons.
3575 2018-01-31 17:30:47 You guys are too slow as the news of this project has been so long ago.
3576 2018-01-31 17:30:31 @704nascarheat will you guys please finally add @j66anderson to the game...
3577 2018-01-31 17:30:30 I can tell you mine in two words: coconut oil.
3578 2018-01-31 17:30:13 Oh no, you've been misinformed. It was after UK colonised this area (like many others) created disputed lands. This is to ensure that the area never rests, whenever one side gets too strong, they support the other to ensure the fight continues and the oil keeps on coming.
3579 2018-01-31 17:30:01 Ya a joke. I actually go 2 few games but it's hard when United have one of the biggest fan bases in the world. An your small oil club has 2 advertise tickets in the local paper an radio station. Just embarrassing!

"No oil, no straws, no genders, no jobs!"
3584 2018-01-31 17:29:41 Okay. He counted Obama’s jobs as growth. He’s barely lowered black unemployment  from Obama’s huge lowering btw. Lied about exporting oil. Obama rescinded the ban. He just lies.

3598 2018-01-31 17:27:57 yeah i've noticed that but why not just use a different oil like sunflower or something? surely the carbon footprint is lower because it can't be produced in the UK

3602 2018-01-31 17:27:33 As long as there is no oil, chimical or prostitution company in that list he won’t even bother to look at it …
3603 2018-01-31 17:27:31 I appreciate the political games you need to play in an oil province. Doesn't make it right to put #oilindustry above the life of the planet. Carbon tax is only part of the solution. The end game is LESS carbon dioxide and #methane or we are toast. No Canadian government gets it.

3613 2018-01-31 17:26:30 I don't agree with it, but one approach to health insurance is to cover major costs but have the individual pay ongoing expenses the same way car insurance covers collisions but not oil changes. I think we should encourage prevention to lower costs, so we should cover flu shots.

3624 2018-01-31 17:25:41 It was difficult to watch Paul Ryan and Trump it was a refreshing reminder that Kennedy unleashed on the GOP who would have us bow to the one percent whom worship oil and monopolies over progress for the planet.
3625 2018-01-31 17:25:38 The stage is also set for 100s of investments in the oil and gas sector. The legal framework is done and while the physical infrastructure and human resource is being built to develop this nascent sector. Many of us look forward fingers crossed
3626 2018-01-31 17:25:34 For a living, He’s going to sell the oil from his face.
3627 2018-01-31 17:25:30 I want one of them jobs where people just rub oil on womens butts. I would do that for the rest of my life
3628 2018-01-31 17:25:23 ME right now, is just a toy for superpowers to abuse and create trouble in to ensure oil prices fall. I have lived and seen the manipulation of superpowers on the ground. If it is fair, just, welcoming and accommodating united ME, then it is good for humanity not just ME.

3641 2018-01-31 17:24:15 By all means, implement this cleaning/recycling project. But if you really care about the planet, you need to stop destroying rainforests to produce palm oil for Frito-Lay products. Don't grandstand! I will return to my Diet Pepsi when you discontinue palm oil use.
3642 2018-01-31 17:24:13 RT geoffreyamoore: Everyone gets that #data is the new oil in the #DigitalEconomy, but not everyone gets that there is a critical difference between data as records­­—data in databases—and data as signals—data from log files, sensors, social media posts, and the like. …
3643 2018-01-31 17:24:11 Yeah or it could be the 40+ years of  PC government focusing Alberta's economy solely on oil instead of diversifying. I mean Alberta went down when Oil crashed.. but youre probably right it was the 2 years of somewhat left leaning policy alone that did Alberta in. Haha

canned tuna + mayo + 1 tsp sesame oil + pinch of salt & pepper + tiny bit of siracha = perfect filling for rice balls  i also like to roll them in crumbled roasted laver instead of wrapping, it's much crunchier and tastier that way

3784 2018-01-31 17:11:03 I like how all of the corporate oil/coal/big money interest super PACs have names like "Small Town American Citizens for New Farming Tools" or "Grassroots Friends for Very Small and Cute Community Gardens"
3785 2018-01-31 17:11:03 that show is one of the best created. Wait till the oil change episode

3792 2018-01-31 17:10:14 have you tried mixing oil into them? Wayne Goss does it and I think it makes a big difference. Just a couple drops of beauty oil works great for me.

3794 2018-01-31 17:10:08 US oil production averaged 10.038 million b/d in November, the first time since November 1970 that US output surpassed 10 million b/d: @EIAgov #OOTT
3795 2018-01-31 17:10:05 $200 to get my engine flushed, full synthetic oil and all my fluids changed
3796 2018-01-31 17:09:48 Dude, Pep has fucking oil reserves to use for player purchases once the money dries up. & he has a board that pisses money away. Unlike the Chelsea board, who penny pinch their lives away
3797 2018-01-31 17:09:42 Pretty proud of myself...got an oil change before I had to for once lol

3801 2018-01-31 17:09:27 US oil output hit 10 million barrels per day in November

3803 2018-01-31 17:09:16 Loss in oil revenue easy to manage for UK so no oil fund required.
3804 2018-01-31 17:09:00 I usually grill them so I don't know, but as I learned it's a good rule of thumb to always do a light coat of oil along the bottom of the pan. Grease/fat can always be drained, but if the meat burns that's that

3809 2018-01-31 17:08:41 If you can have telemetry on electric meters, then why not on oil production? How is storage measured? Is it in real-time? That’s the metric EIA is reverse-calculating from in order to arrive to that Adjustment.
3810 2018-01-31 17:08:39 BIO OIL WILL SAVE YOU. Put it on after moisturizer and before your make up
3811 2018-01-31 17:08:31 I agree!! Drilling in the ocean would be devastating!! Imagine a accident.. Exxon oil spills will be the new norm!! Our oceans need our help not drilling!!
3812 2018-01-31 17:08:28 Main products are ethanol, made mainly from starches and sugars. and, biodiesel, which is derived from oil seeds.
3813 2018-01-31 17:08:26 Halifax Fire HAZMAT crews are responding to Lower Prospect Rd in Lower Prospect for an overturned oil truck that is leaking fuel at this time. Expect delays in the 1800 block.
3814 2018-01-31 17:08:24 It's already helped cushion the blow of losing all the oil revenue last year.

Nationlists can't have it both ways complaining about cuts a deficit.

What great economic ideas do the local managers have ?
3815 2018-01-31 17:08:09 I came in for a oil change two hours later I’m still waiting.
3816 2018-01-31 17:07:58 Fair play to the king power lads. Telling the oil lads to pay up or foad.
3817 2018-01-31 17:07:57 Aku pake face oil  sebelum moist
3818 2018-01-31 17:07:45 Take some rapeseed oil, some verjuice, some Himalayan salt and half a banana and blend.

3821 2018-01-31 17:07:31 @LarryBermanETF       Larry, do u know of a good CDN ETF that holds significant positions in US based oil refining companies? I've done well with $US MPC but hold a lot of $CDN right now.  your insights r always appreciated, thx much
3822 2018-01-31 17:07:24 I always have break outs when i use coconut oil on my face or hair. it's a 5 on their comedogenic scale. Now I'm side eying everyone who blamed it on the quality of my coconut oil (which was trader joes cold pressed and unrefined) Some people have different skincare needs

3824 2018-01-31 17:07:19 Jennyfer,during his campaign, I could see right through him.I looked around & people were supporting him like they were in a trance like state. I said then: “now I know how the anti-Christ will deceive the masses.” If Obama can so easily snake oil people, imagine the anti-Christ.

3830 2018-01-31 17:06:29 I see these girls on IG trying to do skincare tutorials and the biggest giveaway that they don’t know what they’re doing: they apply their oil before moisturizer. Oil is always the last step ladies! It’s the heaviest so it’s gonna sink right into your moisturizer
3831 2018-01-31 17:06:25 Petro = Oil. Coin backed by oil

3837 2018-01-31 17:05:53 #Uzbekistan intends to produce 63 bcm natural gas and 3M tons of oil in 2018. Multiple companies, the biggest one being #Uzbekneftegaz, will invest to reach the target.

3839 2018-01-31 17:05:39 Prospect Bay Rd: situation here is an overturned oil truck that has a confirmed fuel leak, HAZMAT team from the city is now responding with 54 Engine.
3840 2018-01-31 17:05:31 I wouldn't say that it was historically. The tax cut could have done more for small businesses and middle class people. Corporations like the oil companies got a better tax deal and now are raising gas prices. So there goes the middle-class tax break in someone else's pockets.
3841 2018-01-31 17:05:28 Oil moider der pair of youse!!!!
3842 2018-01-31 17:05:24 The Democratic party leaving the Clinton's for the Kennedy's is equivalent to jumping out of one dumpster fire, dousing yourself with diesel and used motor oil, then jumping gleefully into the next burning dumpster
3843 2018-01-31 17:05:23 Gonna get my oil changed, car washed & tanked up before I spend money on stupid shit 
3844 2018-01-31 17:05:13 Even if it could be cleaned up. There is no undoing the damage of an oil spill. It’s just the industry’s way of appeasing the public. But it’s a lie. Like saying the old growth trees will come back. The future is scary with our gov’t the way it is now.

3849 2018-01-31 17:04:46 Just keep it away from your pets. Tea Tree Oil is good for other things
3850 2018-01-31 17:04:22 Good for some things, just not good for all lol. Sunflower and hemp seed oil are very low on the comedogenic scale and good as alternative.
3851 2018-01-31 17:04:19 Agreed, but depends on the type of work being done. This goes without saying. High skilled labour jobs , handling of large equipment, oil fields etc shouldn’t be even considered.
3852 2018-01-31 17:04:19 They have incentives for oil and there were incentives for renewable energy as well.
3853 2018-01-31 17:04:15 @BakhtawarBZ please stand up for human and labor rights you and your brother represent. Provide contractual cleaners at SZABIST min wage.
3854 2018-01-31 17:04:11 Dont think it was Mangala was it. We stood firm and wanted £95 million. FUCK THE OIL
3855 2018-01-31 17:04:09 Even if it’s of an oil type that isn’t that useful. And at the same time as the ev car/battery/renewables/smart grid combination looks be the increasingly dominant energy form for at least the next 30 years.
3856 2018-01-31 17:04:08 U.S. CRUDE OIL PRODUCTION ROSE 384,000 BPD IN NOV TO 10.038 MLN BPD (VS REVISED 9.654 MLN BPD IN OCT)-EIA

3857 2018-01-31 17:04:07 Beating motherfuckers with a bike chain, getting oil on fancy skirts, very good writing imagery please continue.
3858 2018-01-31 17:03:44 Quality of quantity. If that was bear market those were not billion dollar trades. Let alone 2009 crash low and oil low which were trilllion dollar trades. No point in comparing because we all know the truth.

2 tsp dried oregano
1 tsp dried chilli flakes

Mix together, cover the chicken and leave to marinate for a couple hours. Goes great with peppers and lettuce

3883 2018-01-31 17:01:19 Time we boycott @twitter and seek a new platform. Let the Saudi investors lose their money big time. As it is they are in deep trouble with their big spending habits and low oil prices.
3884 2018-01-31 17:01:18 To me, this is why he is so dangerous. He doesn’t even know what that guy just said. Trump is just snooping and spreading bs.  Problem is he is the President and everything he says matter. We have a snake oil seller as President.

3. Cayenne pepper can be used to quickly clot blood in deep cuts

3918 2018-01-31 16:58:31 I’m about to invest in some baby oil. In another month or so when my abs are popping without flexing, act like I’m not going to be oiled up 90% of the time. Might have to go tan too.

3922 2018-01-31 16:58:10 Possible. Could have bought Bill saying "We made news", but can you really buy Bill highfiving someone over "news". Alex has been selling snake oil for the better part of his life, so I wouldn't buy his story and be very skeptical.
3923 2018-01-31 16:58:07 Y’all rub a lil coconut oil on y’all face and start thinking y’all Evelyn Champagne King or some shit.
3924 2018-01-31 16:57:55 Lol huge find - I know straight from the horses mouth there are (and I quote) “tons more oil out there we’ve found but not yet announced as we’re not finished with the older wells”. Straight from a britnat geologist who’s job is exploration in the North Sea no less.
3925 2018-01-31 16:57:49 That's fine. However, that does not change the fact that what he said is not true!! Such a snake oil salesman!
3926 2018-01-31 16:57:44 Just dropped $107 bucks for an oil change. That’s what happens when you go 3,000 miles over your oil change.
3927 2018-01-31 16:57:32 Maybe I don't need gloves in oil painting today [remembers the cut on my index finger] oh yeah
3928 2018-01-31 16:57:13 Il Calcio is past tense. No longer top 3 in Europe. No one is arguing which is most entertaining league in Europe but the point is what has entertainment done for these leagues internationally? Nothing. Stats prove it. TV/Sponsorship deals & oil make it possible 4 EPL & La Liga
3929 2018-01-31 16:57:12 It might be broke down tho. It was leaking oil. We don’t know what’s going to happen. I don’t have the money to get it. It’s literally not worth the money to pay to get it out.
3930 2018-01-31 16:57:11 Why couldn’t @JohnKasich get a tax hike in oil/gas drilling through? “it’s all politics.” says if he had the money, he’d put it on ballot and it would pass overwhelmingly. #APforum2018

3937 2018-01-31 16:56:16 Dear Jacinda, well that may be the case, we would all be better served if you would please rethink your policy statement regarding oil mining applications. The last thing our fragile biodiversity needs is more oil and gas mining.

3942 2018-01-31 16:55:45 If you pour oil on water, does that make the water oily? Or the oil wet?

3970 2018-01-31 16:53:47 I’m so glad I got into the oil and gas industry  I’ve been here almost 3 months and I love my job and my coworkers 
3971 2018-01-31 16:53:41 Day 3: Everything is drowned in olive oil, no one can drive, and even the kids dress better than me.
3972 2018-01-31 16:53:25 The latest RTRS survey suggests that OPEC's oil output rose by 100K bpd MM in January to 32.4mln bpd, with the rise led by Nigeria & Saudi Arabia #OOTT
3973 2018-01-31 16:53:17 They have some wind energy here and a few solar projects coming. Refining oil at home is expensive and no one has stepped up to begin doing it here on a large scale.
3974 2018-01-31 16:53:15 See there's the conspiracy again. We didn't want to take over the Mid East we want the dang oil secure to ensure our economic strength. Always been about oil money from day one. Syria is a whole new ball game. Last week Assad used chlorine barrel bombs on shelters.

3976 2018-01-31 16:53:01 I'm seeing it!

Companies are increasing their capital expenditures especially oil companies. Bonuses are being handed out and many companies are increasing their minimum wage.
3977 2018-01-31 16:53:01 As Saudi Arabia attempts to diversify its economy, remember what happened after the modernization efforts following the '73 oil embargo: a counter neo-Wahhabi movement which forced King Khalid to empower the ulama.

3985 2018-01-31 16:52:20 @NEBCanada Canada needs to get oil to tide water.  You should know this.  Fed Gov't has OK'd pipeline so now you need to DO YOUR JOB and get the BC piple line done.

3987 2018-01-31 16:52:14 Chinese consortium?  Who buys oil from UAE? You are just missing the point i am trying to make. There is nothing wrong that your owner invested but to claim that you didn't receive and everything was built from scratch isnt correct

3989 2018-01-31 16:52:03 I'm not a patch worker, don't work in the oil industry, never have. 

And BC's stance is clearly unconstitutional and contrary to the concept of confederation - even your NDP buddies realize that.

4005 2018-01-31 16:50:38 Independent countries like Norway, Sweden & Denmark have invested to develop ability to profit from decommissioning oil fields and the new renewable industries. ScotGov has done what it can but energy remains reserved and UKGov have done little but commit to Hinkley C.

4016 2018-01-31 16:49:22 Oh so you didn't live here between 2000 and 2008? I remember specifically tons of small businesses closing, gas prices spiking, unemployment at it's highest levels ever, tons of military personnel dying in a war for oil. Being selective is getting so played out.
4017 2018-01-31 16:49:21 It's the same in any field. When you get your first job out of mechanic school you're going to change oil and tires for a year at minimum wage until you prove yourself worthy of getting under the hood.

4021 2018-01-31 16:48:55 It’s mostly CTA’s so it just takes a nudge to set off the dominoes. You only need a small catalyst w/extended positioning. The Fed could boost the dollar, weaken oil & accelerate the sell off. It’s already below the14d moving average. China manufacturing data was weak today too.

4036 2018-01-31 16:47:38 As the top Democrat on Appropriations, I know we have a big job to do to fund the government. Last night's series of unctuous platitudes from a snake oil salesman doesn’t get the job done. #sotu
4037 2018-01-31 16:47:16 Would this be the same CDC you are praising from the rooftops each time they say something you agree with, or is this a different CDC that none of us know about? The gate doesn't need any more oil, it's swinging both ways with ease!
4038 2018-01-31 16:46:56 you cant compare with Norway they have totally different set up and by the way Norways income from oil has dropped dramatically too which is why they are now diversifying their funds elsewhere. If oil co's can get the oil out the ground cheaper they will they just sit on assets.
4039 2018-01-31 16:46:49 Welcome to the LIGHT - about time folk were shying away from the vile rags and their 'elite' friends in Westminster. Us Scottish folk woke up before the last referendum - every dirty trick was used - then they got oil bosses to downgrade their estimates on what's offshore

4045 2018-01-31 16:45:50 Important to know you have quality oils. Also, i learned through research a couple years ago how dangerous tea tree oil is to animals. I used to use it as a natural flea repellent. No more.

4050 2018-01-31 16:45:36 Disappointed to discover that the sump oil had left the @saatchi_gallery. It was the exhibit I most enjoyed, nay, understood. Now art lovers Down Under may marvel at it.
4051 2018-01-31 16:45:27 My friends told me about oregano oil drops  supposed to be fantastic
4052 2018-01-31 16:45:10 ExxonMobil, the largest US energy group, plans to increase its shale oil production in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico fivefold to 500,000 barrels a day in 2025, the company said on Tuesday.
4053 2018-01-31 16:45:06 Whenever pipelines are opposed, oil patch workers in Alberta suddenly become constitutional scholars concerned with the National Interest...
4054 2018-01-31 16:45:03 100% pure tea tree oil is toxic to animals either way, also any oils being used around animals should be diffused anyways since animals smell and react differently than humans do.
4055 2018-01-31 16:44:51 ah fab, its looking like that is the leading flavour in popularity so far, we are thinking of adding a natural choc brownie flavoured oil to one of our coffees, so it infuses to create a mocha flavoured coffee for brewing without all the added calories of coffee shop drinks
4056 2018-01-31 16:44:46 VA is please, will you how i get castor oil for this EP with a space  you wanna feel cool bot tweet thanks shaw where can

4059 2018-01-31 16:44:26 A love story of oil and water
4060 2018-01-31 16:44:09 ถึงกับต้องซูมภาพกันเลยแหละ #เกรทพอร์ช
4061 2018-01-31 16:44:02 Also LIGHT/DRY Argan oil hair mist is one of my favs :-)
4062 2018-01-31 16:43:55 Not as odd as " where would the SNP get the money to set up an oil fund ?".
4063 2018-01-31 16:43:50 I swear I don’t wanna wait at wal mart to get a oil change and some tires 
4064 2018-01-31 16:43:50 Congratulations!! Nice looking ride . I look forward to the start of the season . Good luck
4065 2018-01-31 16:43:43 Truck looks badass congrats
4066 2018-01-31 16:43:42 They want that oil and trade routes
4067 2018-01-31 16:43:38 QUEBEC have to rid of LIBERALS and exploit their oil ====ANTICOSTI!!!
4068 2018-01-31 16:43:25 thank-you so much for this! i recently used tee tree oil in a diffuser and didn't think about the possibility it was harmful to my cats 
i hope your cat and dog are doing better!! 
4069 2018-01-31 16:43:23 I put Jamaican black castor oil on my eyelashes before bed. Helps them grow longer and stronger and prevent damage from mascara
4070 2018-01-31 16:43:15 And the reason for all those things hasn’t changed either. Religion and oil. Tell me I’m wrong. Everything else is smoke and mirrors...just a distraction...hey look a shiny thing.
4071 2018-01-31 16:43:14 Check your Transmission oil this weekend.
4072 2018-01-31 16:43:04 In BJP rule ...companies owned by Ambani become Government companies...and BSNL ..ONGC become Step child

BJP PM Modi himself come forward for its advertisement

In atal bihari vajpayee rule..BJP gave full support to Reliance..kar loo duniya Muthi mein and now jio and oil price
4073 2018-01-31 16:43:02 an animated movie a la finding nemo  that follows two baby sea turtles trying to find their way home after being hatched. except it's specifically about ocean conservation so none of their siblings survived and they swim past a dying great barrier reef and oil spills
4074 2018-01-31 16:43:02 I know. Some people like to believe there are 24 lb largemouth bass in West Point Lake. They'd like to believe my uncle once caught one, and it would have been the state record, but that gosh-darn boat motor started eating oil.

The reality is that my uncle doesn't own a boat.
4075 2018-01-31 16:43:00 Keep filling oil
4076 2018-01-31 16:42:57 i bought 3 qt of oil for my car to find out i didn’t even need to buy it and my oil is fine. so now i need my $ back wtf am i gonna do with oil

4080 2018-01-31 16:42:20 Malem ini ngga mau muluk-muluk. Mau diffuse oil yg bikin nggak gila aja.
4081 2018-01-31 16:42:09 Inka shoot undi Rangasthalam ...thala ki oil pettukunnadu anthe ...diff look kaadhu
4082 2018-01-31 16:42:03 Sam, I would also love it, but we should not forget that the US is one of the few countries providing weekly oil statistics...
4083 2018-01-31 16:41:53 That is a sweet looking truck! Love it!
4084 2018-01-31 16:41:49 Ooo yes. And use some of the bath oil stuff to help me relax some more. Ty 
4085 2018-01-31 16:41:49 I got good ass hair I used only water for years but then it remind me bitch you definitely still black you better lay some type of oil , paste , or gel in this bitch k
4086 2018-01-31 16:41:45 Good luck this year man; wishing you the best!!! #trueunderdog
4087 2018-01-31 16:41:41 the fact #oil is only down 30 cents after that bearish EIA datapoint today is very bullish. Oil chart needs to consolidate anyway. Still...very bullish IMHO
4088 2018-01-31 16:41:40 ขนาดสัญญากับตัวเองยังทำไม่ได้แล้วจะไปสัญญากับใครได้
4089 2018-01-31 16:41:39 why, yes, public surveillance will go over GREAT with the American people and the oil business.
4090 2018-01-31 16:41:39 I literally have to got to have the most expensive oil change known to man 
4091 2018-01-31 16:41:27 設定上であれ現実の土地であれ現地語にしたいのわかる
4092 2018-01-31 16:41:25 The problem is not expertise, but rather fools and charlatans claiming to have it. The anti-animal fat craze started in the 50s based on a flawed study done in Russia of all places. Food oil industry was happy to offer trans-fats as a replacement. Millions died of heart disease.

4094 2018-01-31 16:41:05 Pretty sure everyone answered yes or no to all four options. They didn’t just pick one answer.
4095 2018-01-31 16:41:02 Oil of oregano comes back and haunts you all day after taking it
4096 2018-01-31 16:40:55 No offense intended, but who cares?

After Cheney invited oil/energy executives to the white house shielded from disclosure, and after the Plame incident (just to cite 2 examples), and after the ho-hum of Watergate, why wouldn't Americans be inured to Republican treachery?
4097 2018-01-31 16:40:44 Looks good brother!
4098 2018-01-31 16:40:41 Here at a Midas in southwest Ohio, An African-American woman came in for an oil change and was told a 2 hour wait. She scheduled for tomorrow morning. White guy rolls in, 20 minutes.
4099 2018-01-31 16:40:41 Cost have been cut substantially in the North Sea with new fields profitable at 20% of the current price. Norway made circa £18B in 2017 from oil/gas, we made practically nothing due to UKGov policies. We need to take control of our own assets if we ever want Scotland to prosper.
4100 2018-01-31 16:40:39 workout. breakfast. podcast. water. coconut oil. write. deep breath. this is the last day of January. Ready for a new month.
4101 2018-01-31 16:40:37 My friend uses it with oil and its fine, she said its too strong and can break your hair on its own
4102 2018-01-31 16:40:37 Catch it while you can before @EPAScottPruitt and @SecretaryZinke look the other way and allow oil right in that beautiful horizon.  Really sad.
4103 2018-01-31 16:40:31 Man City are the footballing equivalent of a lottery winner saying how well they’re doing. Before their Middle Eastern oil money windfall they were trophy less. Besides the league cup in 1976 of course
4104 2018-01-31 16:40:29 นี่คือเหตุผลที่ชั้นรักเขา
4105 2018-01-31 16:40:26 Congrats Jordan!!  Good luck this season!

4110 2018-01-31 16:40:09 世界一サラダ油だと言ってくれ。
4111 2018-01-31 16:40:02 Pensaba que la Stadandard Oil habia "desaparecido" en 1911 por la ley antimonopolio y de ahí salieron varias empresas, entre ellas Exxon, Mobil, Chevron, Conoco, y muchas otras (aunque con nombre distinto en sus comienzos)
4112 2018-01-31 16:40:00 My aesthetic: writing poetry out of the moon with edible rose on my tea, my skin drenched in jasmine oil and my hair stroked by a beast
4113 2018-01-31 16:39:54 Sir diesel crossed rs 65.25 in Gurgaon today. What amount will your goverment sell when oil touches 120$. 100 rupees per litre? @narendramodi  your time is up. 2019 congress is coming back. @OfficeOfRG you are an arrogant leader who has pushed this economy into hell.
4114 2018-01-31 16:39:42 The red oil on Morata's head never do Chelsea, them come add groundnut oil from Giroud own. This draw soup go purge person finally 
4115 2018-01-31 16:39:42 Shinny is a hair style I think they oil their heasa daily..Right?
4116 2018-01-31 16:39:37 Camden Hols (can) very good. @frameworkbrews Stenson 's Beard Oil (cask) & a few new pubs...
4117 2018-01-31 16:39:37 The use of solar energy has not been opened up because the oil industry does not own the sun. - Ralph Nader
4118 2018-01-31 16:39:37 Right! Lmao talmbout “it seems like your tires are starting to bald” ummmm I’ll worry bout my life... change my oil please
4119 2018-01-31 16:39:36 Been fan, now it has a great number and sponsor too. Let's get some wins this year.
4120 2018-01-31 16:39:34 The global oil market is primed for a ‘violent’ plunge back to $60 a barrel as hedge funds continue to place record bets that oil prices will march higher.
4121 2018-01-31 16:39:33 Jasmine oil
4122 2018-01-31 16:39:31 The main problem with the 'K' Class is that they were steam powered submarines complete with oil fired high pressure steam boilers and funnels - this meant that the submarines were very large by the standard of their day and hence difficult to control
4123 2018-01-31 16:39:23 My uncle got me addicted to eggs on toast with olive oil

He always kno the good food
4124 2018-01-31 16:39:16 Of course! Oilfest celebrates ALL oil!
4125 2018-01-31 16:39:15 If the legislative arm that created the NOSDRA Act cannot impose fines and sanctions on oil companies, is it NOSDRA that will now have the power to?
4126 2018-01-31 16:39:07 For some reason the entire train smells of Olbas Oil and it is WONDERFUL
4127 2018-01-31 16:38:56 Gas and oil prices will never recover how can there be any return in investment? It's like starting 'civilization' game on contaminated land
4128 2018-01-31 16:38:53 Congratulations! Sharp looking truck!
4129 2018-01-31 16:38:45 Don't know bout creams but vitamin E oil is cool

4133 2018-01-31 16:38:26 Canadians never wanted #NAFTA i the first place.  Mulroney burned us and left us with a legacy of inequality and de-industrialization replaced by debt condos oil and FIRE as a substitute and @cafreeland knows that - trade is important - fair trade
4134 2018-01-31 16:38:10 All I taste is oil on oil on oil . Euuw
4135 2018-01-31 16:38:03 Yes, not enough anti-nausea meds in the country to tempt me to even listen...cannot stand the sound of his snake-oil-salesman voice.
4136 2018-01-31 16:37:55 2) Lot of preservatives, dyes and chemical agents in food, oil and other eatables need to detected by portable kits which can tell instanty what is fit for consumption. But the department entrusted with food safety has none of these kits.
4137 2018-01-31 16:37:53 Damn i use too much oil for my skincare. Kena beli moisturizer cream jugak ni takleh depend pakai argan oil & bio oil je, takut clogged pores je dahlah pore mmg beso dah

4139 2018-01-31 16:37:47 Olive oil?
4140 2018-01-31 16:37:27 I forgot how the smell of slide oil and brass stains your hands after practice. It's a big ole rip. And my lips hurt. Relearning trombone is a bit of pain.
4141 2018-01-31 16:37:16 I used to take glucosamine/chondroitin, and fish oil for perceived benefits, but the more I hear, the less I'm convinced of benefit. The only supplement I now take is calcium, recommended by a physician.
4142 2018-01-31 16:37:15 I’ve noticed when someone opposes a pipeline, oil patch workers suddenly become constitutional experts concerned with the National Interest.

4144 2018-01-31 16:37:01 Iran vs saudia Arabia r fighting over Golan heights oil
4145 2018-01-31 16:36:57 So the slick, slimy salesman-in-chief tries another snake oil scam...sad...just more drivel from this rectalineus flambosis maximus-in-chief

4150 2018-01-31 16:36:22 Like oil and water, me and metaphors don't mix... As for me and similes... Another story...
4151 2018-01-31 16:36:18 And in news tomorrow, oil prices jump for no reason and the loonie drops.
4152 2018-01-31 16:36:18 Jordan's a good one to add to the fam, for sure, Isaka. 
4153 2018-01-31 16:36:17 น่ารั๊กกกกก
4154 2018-01-31 16:36:15 Russia grew only because oil bubble. How can this be a good generalizing example? Actually US market is key to China but yeah it can do without US market sacrifing 1-2% gdp growth. However my point was that US debt market doesnt depend on China buying UST
4155 2018-01-31 16:36:10 Hoooly beautiful
4156 2018-01-31 16:36:08 My oil diffuser pendant broke in my hands. #tears
4157 2018-01-31 16:36:07 Do you know some food stuff including edible oil, unpackaged spices or street snacks that you consume can be carcinogenic because food safety inspectors are not doing their job professionally. Perhaps chemical agents/reagents explain epidemic in cancer in Kashmir. 
READ ON.
4158 2018-01-31 16:35:57 Or you can do a simple lemon butter sauce. More olive oil based rather. Olive oil, little butter, basil, oregano, lemon. Add veggies, finish with parm
4159 2018-01-31 16:35:45 That’s why we adore you Seth!! Your real every day people you know what it’s like. Too damn sad that 45 didn’t mean a word of what he said. Big snake oil salesman
4160 2018-01-31 16:35:42 RM35.80 at Watsons! Not sure kalau Guardian murah sikit  What oil cleanser are you using now?
4161 2018-01-31 16:35:41 This lady in class went from talking about walking on campus to oil spills in about two seconds
4162 2018-01-31 16:35:38 Do what? 500 less for fuel oil? gain 12 cents? I've posted the actual tax rates. Show me where poor people only save 12 cents & where people in Puerto Rico still pay higher rates. And then explain who had $500 taken from them as you claim.
4163 2018-01-31 16:35:19 I’ve been seeing such a rise in essential oil diffuser usage and how it’s toxic to animals. About 1-2 articles a day and people’s stories. I will never use my diffuser again just Incase these findings are true. My dog’s life is more important.
4164 2018-01-31 16:35:13 Congrats @j66anderson !
4165 2018-01-31 16:35:09 Sir diesel crossed rs 65.25 in Gurgaon today. What amount will your goverment sell when oil touches 120$. 100 rupees per litre? @narendramodi  your time is up. 2019 congress is coming back. @OfficeOfRG
4166 2018-01-31 16:35:05 I need to find & buy a huge jar of coconut oil
4167 2018-01-31 16:35:03 Congrats! Excited for 2018!

4169 2018-01-31 16:34:44 I forgot to use my beard oil this morning, and I just know it’s gonna throw my whole day off...smfh
4170 2018-01-31 16:34:35 I am more surprised that crude is rallying after report. I didnt think oil traders could be so rationale and could apply analytical thought to such precise details...def a positive for crude pricing if holds up imo.
4171 2018-01-31 16:34:23 Kumpletong kulay lang ng oil pastel sa bday ko masaya na ako hehe
4172 2018-01-31 16:33:54 Taking my baby to get a oil change !
4173 2018-01-31 16:33:53 Welcome to our family @j66anderson !!!!!!!! 
4174 2018-01-31 16:33:50 You forgot Jeb's son, who is ex CIA like his grandfather & who got elected in Texas to regulate OIL.
4175 2018-01-31 16:33:47 Summary: Man City is self financed.

They're not funded by another Nation or its "oil money"; they spend what they generate.
4176 2018-01-31 16:33:18 Awesome looking truck let’s get this season started
4177 2018-01-31 16:33:18 Randomly applying coconut oil to hair your hair in class

4180 2018-01-31 16:33:06 Head gasket, oil pan, tires, wipers, and two bolts apparently are missing
4181 2018-01-31 16:33:05 oil pulling is so disgusting omg
4182 2018-01-31 16:33:04 You for got pollution.. reduce, reuse, recycle, and repollution.. there's no green way around it.. I recycle my plastic and oil to make gasoline..
4183 2018-01-31 16:32:52 Cannabis legalization represents a new dawn for treating anxiety, pain, and other common ailments. CBD Oil will change the RX game. #BellLetsTalk #CannabisOil #Cannabis

4185 2018-01-31 16:32:28 and he was a Sr. VP of a major US oil company and many of his friends at his work had the same thoughts as well during that period
4186 2018-01-31 16:32:24 Do the leaves naturally taste tangy and delicious like this or did they add some sort of oil..?
4187 2018-01-31 16:32:20 If skincare is such bullshit, how did I know that my husband needed to switch from a moisturizer to a face oil to treat his chronically dry skin hmmmm?
4188 2018-01-31 16:32:04 Low income people will pay less because of the personal exemption. To balance that, the fuel assistance program gets deep cuts and the 12 cents the low income person gained as a tax benefit is 500 less in help for fuel oil.
4189 2018-01-31 16:31:57 まあ1回で何時間やるのかわからないんですけどね
4190 2018-01-31 16:31:45 @ChrisGPackham Hi Chris.
Watched your documentary - In search of the lost girl. Fantastic & so sad! Totally inspired by this very emotional story.
Have been to Borneo twice & seen the devastation & uprising of the awful Palm Oil plantations - so your story hit the heart for sure!
4191 2018-01-31 16:31:44 Just spilled industrial oil solution on my Nike tech hoodie so it’s definitely SMD until my new shit get here
4192 2018-01-31 16:31:32 Vitamin E oil and baby lotion mix!!!!
4193 2018-01-31 16:31:31 The centre of Edinburgh is so not Edinburgh. Chi chi cafes, restaurants and pubs ain’t it. That’s the domain of the flaneur, the BoHo day tripping Weedgie, we’ll upholstered Morningside matrons. An easy, common mistake by visitors to my toun. oil fuelled lawnmowers btw 
4194 2018-01-31 16:31:30 Please don’t post a pic of your eggs if they are sticking to the pan and burning  1. Your heat is waaaayy to high 2. Please use some butter oil or something. Your welcome
4195 2018-01-31 16:31:27 se disparan inventarios de petroleo 

U.S. commercial crude oil inventories increased by 6.8 million barrels from the previous week
4196 2018-01-31 16:31:26 バイトだいたい15時から入れてるからいけそうだな…

4198 2018-01-31 16:31:21 Isn’t it funny that in 2014 we told couldn’t afford to be independent because of the price of oil & it was running out. But low & behold BP reports finding two large new oil fields off Aberdeen don’t you just hate bad oil it’s a curse

4201 2018-01-31 16:30:48 Follow Whole Food, Plant based, (no meat, dairy, oil) diet.  Fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts and seeds.. you will get everything except SUNSHINE (Vit D) and Bacteria from streams (B12) ..  The B12 is the only supplement I take, when I remember.  B12 is common.  I don't worry.

4203 2018-01-31 16:30:44 i remember i used to use coconut oil to wash my face and my skin was breaking out in little tiny bumps that werent pop-able and i had no idea what was the cause now i realise it was clogging my pores IT KEPT MY SKIN SMOOTH but my poor pores

4207 2018-01-31 16:30:21 Trump attempts to make America a subsidy of Russia monopolizing oil and steel and other entities.. Clean energy rids us of oil and dinosaurs.
4208 2018-01-31 16:30:20 Like a vampire, he drinks oil out of robots.
4209 2018-01-31 16:30:11 With Trump’s bankruptcy history - why do you believe you and all of us will proper? He’s like a snake oil salesman. You must look at his history and the big picture. Not just the lies he spews and has you believe.
4210 2018-01-31 16:30:10 They get around financial fair play by asking Etihad Airways, again owned by the same oil money, for a bigger sponsorship deal.
4211 2018-01-31 16:30:02 BBC releases a documentary called &quot;White Fright: Divided Britain&quot;Shows how Muslim immigration/integration is an orange Cheeto clown who is literally the epitome of snake oil salesman.
4212 2018-01-31 16:30:02 Govt has raised the price of petrol & diesel again on the pretext of increase in price of crude oil in international market. Point to consider that when price of crude oil was going down, why Govt was not providing complete relief in POL prices. Ishaq Dollar ko maut kun parti thi
4213 2018-01-31 16:29:57 Ran outra oil... Got oil ... Went to take a shower ... No hot water ..  Grand
4214 2018-01-31 16:29:47 Unnecessary offshore drilling to appease big oil isn't a good look. Generally I voted against his policies and I'm glad that he actually hasn't been more successful enacting them. Not to say I don't want America to be successful, I just don't agree with his way of going about it.
4215 2018-01-31 16:29:33 Through the powerful mechanism of the Standard Oil Trust, Rockefeller was able to completely crush all competition, unlawfully now defined as a monopoly (AS2 66-74, 86-87).
4216 2018-01-31 16:29:28 160 bucks for snake oil? SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!!!!
4217 2018-01-31 16:29:17 Coconut oil for my hair issa no. Next.
4218 2018-01-31 16:28:54 Agreed, but it's funny what oil money can do isnt it.
4219 2018-01-31 16:28:45 $MNGA Is not a fossil fuel company so stop comparing it to Oil and NG! Total renewable energy company with proprietary products. Its the deference between Coal and Solar. Huge expansions, Huge gains on the horizon. Buy And Hold!!
4220 2018-01-31 16:28:31 Would love to rub baby oil on you
4221 2018-01-31 16:28:10 朝って何時からやってんだｲ
4222 2018-01-31 16:27:57 Congrats and not surprised, it such good oil.
4223 2018-01-31 16:27:41 It is a conspiracy to make America a subsidy of Russia monopolizing oil and steel among other entities at a time when the world is stepping away from oil to clean energy.
4224 2018-01-31 16:27:38 As if she could look more perfect then she gets covered in oil 
4225 2018-01-31 16:27:31 One of the girls I work with blew her car up by not putting oil in it.

I've heard of that happening too many females...

Ladies. Your car will not run & blow up if you don't put oil in it..

4226 2018-01-31 16:27:11 I’m about to get an oil change I can’t wait for them to charge me $600 because I don’t know any better they’ll be like “your left scoreboard carburetor is broken” and I’ll be like dammmmn
4227 2018-01-31 16:26:53 If I recall the explanation I correctly got last time there was an oil spill, energy/resources and economy oversee these projects once operational. Environment is concerned mostly with the approval process here.
4228 2018-01-31 16:26:52 He's working for billionaires, Putin, white supremacists, oil companies.
Just try to be a little more skeptical.
It's not just CNN...it's pretty much the entire world that has figured this guy out.
Look around outside the alt-right bubble. Good luck, Lana!

4238 2018-01-31 16:26:04 Unlike gas & oil, electric subsidies are peanuts ... if you REALLY want to hate on subsidies look at the ones given to the oil and gas industries, & I don't mean just the usual ones, look deeper for all the costs we absorb relating to spills & pollution cleanup ... $$ TRILLIONS

4243 2018-01-31 16:25:49 Paying $5 for a logo? Now *that's* some quality branding-- plucked straight from clip art.  If you're paying less than an oil change for a logo/mark, it's not a logo. #GetWhatYouPayFor
4244 2018-01-31 16:25:46 Tbh just use coconut oil. Cheap and effective. 
 Got rid of all the eczema on my face. 
Also lightly exfoliate to get rid of all the already dried out skin
4245 2018-01-31 16:25:44 why does the price of oil keep going up I thought we were going to be self-sufficient and have all kinds of oil
4246 2018-01-31 16:25:40 i'm doing oil pulling and a foot bath and it will be followed by a pedicure, a bomb ass shower and a face and hair mask
i'm so ready to pamper myself
4247 2018-01-31 16:25:39 People don't buy their opposition. Democrats are just not a trustworthy party as long as leading figures are still funded by Wall Street, big Oil and big Pharma and free university and healthcare are considered "too radical".
4248 2018-01-31 16:25:36 I started using Shea Moistures skin care line this week and it has tea tree oil which is so good for your skin
4249 2018-01-31 16:25:31 Anti-aging hand treatment - soak your hands in milk for 15 mins. Rinse then apply a bit of olive oil on them.
4250 2018-01-31 16:25:28 .@CBCStephenQuinn @CBCEarlyEdition figures as of 2015, 'production of crude oil represents just 3% of Canada's GDP' (The Economist) ... it is an industry that has always been good at glamorizing itself; the 'boom' phenomenon

4255 2018-01-31 16:25:02 Is Joseph Kennedy III still at that auto shop. I need an oil change down. 
4256 2018-01-31 16:25:01 If Cameroon wants inward investment it should be prepared to pay its bills to companies that have invested heavily and are not being paid via Government owned
Companies.Victoria Oil and Gas who supplied ENEOS with Gas for their generators Cameroon now not able to. Bad for GDP.I
4257 2018-01-31 16:25:00 The UK myth of diminishing oil wealth busted.
4258 2018-01-31 16:24:57 It's not how much oil there is it's what we get out of it. Lack of investment in the Scottish supply chain means we get less industrial/economic benefit than Norway, USA & shipyards in Singapore & elsewhere!
4259 2018-01-31 16:24:52 Day of discoveries by Big Oil: @BP_plc in the North Sea, @Chevron and @Total in the U.S GoM earlier, and now @Shell as well. Is something lurking out there @exxonmobil?

4263 2018-01-31 16:24:11 That’s me
I walk in saying “i know everything wrong with my car, but I’m not here for that..I’m here for an oil change”
4264 2018-01-31 16:24:07 As a natural remedy;Mix 1/3 proportion of glycerin oil with 2/3 rose water in a spraying bottle.
4265 2018-01-31 16:24:06 getting my oil & filter changed this Saturday at 8:00 AM. This tweet is on point. hah
4266 2018-01-31 16:24:02 The price of oil and gas goes up and down every day.  How many times do we complain when we fill up our vehicles.
4267 2018-01-31 16:24:00 (3)The boom over the last several years in American energy production has turned the country into a significant exporter of oil and natural gas, which has bolstered the economy. Trump got that right in his State of the Union on Tuesday night.
4268 2018-01-31 16:23:59 first you were all tweeting about putting nut on your face now coconut oil... are locals ok
4269 2018-01-31 16:23:40 I’ve been seeing a lot of coconut oil slander on my TL lately...where all this coming from?
4270 2018-01-31 16:23:18 The NDP have hidden behind a booming ecconony and substainal job growth long enough. It is time for a true conservative approach.  Mass subsudies to foreign oil, sell off and demolish schools/hospitals,  environment phased out in favor if clean ethical coal.
4271 2018-01-31 16:23:17 It looks like some pour soul was hit in the head by a 55-gallon oil drum that had been launched via trebuchet
4272 2018-01-31 16:23:16 Yes, no reason to be paying for a basic oil change and filter hangs
4273 2018-01-31 16:23:12 What an idiot but then again his whole FB site is about selling Trump trinkets like the snake oil salesman he is.  And it looks like he will be needing addition funds to make Stormy just stop talking.

4279 2018-01-31 16:22:58 There’s something about getting an oil change, car wash, and tire rotation, and then chilling in the wait room with free coffee that makes me feel like a king
4280 2018-01-31 16:22:56 Bitch coconut oil don’t work !
4281 2018-01-31 16:22:54 Notley says all the usual things - blah, blah, blah - but in her NDP heart she wants to stomp Alberta oil and gas industry - if she gets an assist or own goal from BC - bonus.
4282 2018-01-31 16:22:54 Dont use PJ. Regular Oil of Olay works naman.  PJ feels heavy on one's face.

4290 2018-01-31 16:22:05 It is so much more than just energy which is created through Oil and Natural Gas. Energy Security is National Security.
4291 2018-01-31 16:22:00 and ripping up the Geneva Conventions and waging war for Oil and Empire.
4292 2018-01-31 16:21:57 This is for GUYS only cause I want to understand. Do you have a seperate cream/oil/lotion  for your face and body or do you use the same thing for your body and face
4293 2018-01-31 16:21:54 Shasya mah paripurna fotonya ga mungkin kaya gitu... Kalau ada bekas nyeplakan jemur juga artistik dibentuk tanning oil pastik 
4294 2018-01-31 16:21:53 This was reported by USA Today. (1)The boom over the last several years in American energy production has turned the country into a significant exporter of oil and natural gas, which has bolstered the economy. Trump got that right in his State of the Union on Tuesday night.
4295 2018-01-31 16:21:48 I remember being in my early twenties and my mom told me to oil my feet when I wear sandals cause lotion don’t last. I slipped and slid in oily sandals for almost 5 years before I got shit right lololol
4296 2018-01-31 16:21:28 My mom says it doesn't get better than Teddy singing "rub me down with some hot oils baby, & I'll do the same for you". I wouldn't want oil on my body-- in my food, well, yeppers, that's good.
4297 2018-01-31 16:21:25 so so so thankful for coconut oil
4298 2018-01-31 16:21:21 I know the full story!
The US government alone owes Haiti close to a $1 trillion in gold. The US is drilling oil off Haitian coast right now! Similar story with France!
4299 2018-01-31 16:21:16 It's more of an issue how the stats are framed elsewhere, rather than the stats themselves - "Oil production is up/down/flat!!!1" rather than "The EIA estimates..."

I know journos often write "according to the EIA", but the avg punter reads that as authoritative, not as a caveat
4300 2018-01-31 16:21:01 This vitamin E and witch hazel oil has been woooorking
4301 2018-01-31 16:20:58 How much is this babe? Thinking of changing my oil cleanser rn but dunno which one to buy hmm
4302 2018-01-31 16:20:38 I continue to ask what is being done abut it. Let me answer nothing. This #shitholepresident is like oil everything slips off him. He’s untouchable. Our country the democracy as we know it is gone.
4303 2018-01-31 16:20:25 i shower earlier in the evening and dont go to bed till its dry and put a lil coconut oil in when its still wet but it only looks decent like 50% of the time
4304 2018-01-31 16:20:23 5k can go a long way for me and my family to get rice,beans,gari palm oil and Maggie.

4308 2018-01-31 16:19:30 Side note, I have no idea what's holding up oil right now. After that report, I expect to see $63 fast and $61 by EOW.
4309 2018-01-31 16:19:16 Yes, that ones okay, I just feel like all the texture on my face is amplified when I wear that foundation :(( I just bought Josie Maran w Argan oil because I have dry skin but it makes me look like a greaseball

4315 2018-01-31 16:18:43 Just tell people is it realistic keeping in global oil prices or not

4319 2018-01-31 16:18:19 I am getting my oil changed and all they have on is Fox News... HELP ME!! They are bitching about Hillary.  I'm so shocked..
4320 2018-01-31 16:18:15 I do like a bath bomb but my fave is about 10 drops of frankincense oil. I've been told in Middle East this is called 'little hug'. #bliss
4321 2018-01-31 16:18:09 So I have really dry skin and use coconut oil to help moisture my face and body because I find that it consistently works better than moisturizers. Anyway, I also feed my cat coconut oil for his teeth and fur. He goes nuts () for the stuff.
4322 2018-01-31 16:18:07 Maybe his jaw needed oil. #RussianBot
4323 2018-01-31 16:18:07 I’m a product junkie so always have loads of stuff on the go that I alternate. I use a retinoid and lactic acid from the ordinary about once a week each, an spf cream even in winter, niacinamide & zinc if I’m getting spotty and I love a heavy oil or moisturiser

4326 2018-01-31 16:17:58 finally got the stomach to crack it open and it quickly turned on the notion of "If only BIG OIL stuck around to save L.A.!!"

4338 2018-01-31 16:16:27 Beard oil and pills have been bought.
4339 2018-01-31 16:16:12 @KayandKosh put me on to this coconut oil and shea butter mix moisturizer. My skin thanks you lol
4340 2018-01-31 16:16:05 HAHAHAAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAA laa la it's olive oil
4341 2018-01-31 16:16:04 Its not running out but it is too expensive to extract. Thats why theres a massive downturn in the oil industry.
4342 2018-01-31 16:15:55 Democrats have socialism and terrorism- but who wants the snake oil?
4343 2018-01-31 16:15:52 Sorry sir your 2006 vehicle doesnt have free oil changes
4344 2018-01-31 16:15:46 Whip together 4 tsps chew with 2 tablespoons barbecue. Blend with Olive Oil. Drain through cheesecloth Serve over kale.
4345 2018-01-31 16:15:45 What is the problem with wood fires? 
I rely totally on burning wood for heat, on the basis that it is renewable: not coal or oil.
No CO2 comes out that doesn't go back in to grow more wood.
4346 2018-01-31 16:15:36 'Obsessesed' and 'oil' are now the most used words amongst City fans.
4347 2018-01-31 16:15:31 If you dump a band. In you will be straight. In cryto but anything less than that it's hard to see a major profit
4348 2018-01-31 16:15:11 USD stronger, oil weaker
4349 2018-01-31 16:15:06 With the help of your prayer warriors that did oil to $70pb, just maybe! 

But they would need to triple down on those prayers and vigils this time around. Nigeria's exchange rate is like the rock of Gibraltar.

4351 2018-01-31 16:15:02 From past few years,people from oil and gas sector are facing Job problem and that is  very serious issue but unfortunately no one is addressing this issue. No permanent jobs are available. Though there are vacancies in  EPC firm, we Have to go through third party consultancy.
4352 2018-01-31 16:14:57 Sprinkle a little salt in your pan if you're frying. This will prevent the oil from splattering.
4353 2018-01-31 16:14:55 OMG those crazy vancouverites dont want their city to turn into an oil port they must not want any oil products at all! Look at how faux edgy I am! /sarcasm

4361 2018-01-31 16:14:12 Just wait for the oil to run out...
4362 2018-01-31 16:14:06 Congrats on the truck man! Good luck in 2018, we’re counting on you!
4363 2018-01-31 16:14:04 Do you ever fart and then, as a full grown up, consider caster oil?
4364 2018-01-31 16:13:58 I think it's a case of "don't bring a cigarette lighter into an oil refinery." Everyone unfortunately had the choice not to use the app and used it anyway.

4370 2018-01-31 16:13:27 Also they don’t spend near a billion pounds on a gas plant for the short term also I was at a meeting showing us the operations like they pump oil to the plant take the gas out of it and put the spent oil back to the reservoir multimillion pound investment

4377 2018-01-31 16:12:59 Destruction of environmental protections will lead to losses in the trillions.  Our tourism economy is tanking.  Focus on Dinosaur Fossil fuels will only help Big Oil.  Demoralization of the nation globally will help destroy us.  #Stopyourlying
4378 2018-01-31 16:12:52 Same with me. Had more discomfort than pain. I went to the ER and they gave me toradol and sent me home. I take Chanca Piedra, apple cider vinegar, lemons, and olive oil now, too.

4381 2018-01-31 16:12:17 We need a better system to distribute the wealth of our country; the oil underneath our earth and seas belongs to everyone in our borders. Norway nationalized its oil industry and used the profits for healthcare and education for everyone in Norway!!
4382 2018-01-31 16:12:12 Cannabis oil is usually made from single-bladed "sugar leaves," which are high in THC and grow in the buds of a marijuana plant.

4385 2018-01-31 16:11:59 I'd put my money on Trump releasing it soon .... but if he waits six months to delay dropping conspiracy snake oil while absurdly saying FBI is somehow overruling him, then it comes out in some mashed form and they blame Deep State for contorting it, I really won't be surprised
4386 2018-01-31 16:11:55 regarding lrt - be careful abt ur essential oil use around pets (esp cats, the oil builds up in their system and can’t leave the way it leaves a human’s body) in general - especially citrus oils (orange, lemon, neroli) and spicy oils (cinnamon, etc)
4387 2018-01-31 16:11:46 Oil na na nibuild up tungod sa pressure sa removal HAHAHAH
4388 2018-01-31 16:11:35 EVerything for OIL.   Scott’s killing our environment for profit. Greed is the root of all evil. You are an evil man. Hope you pay for your sins.
4389 2018-01-31 16:11:30 Get the kind with coconut oil. It's really good for your skin. ;)
4390 2018-01-31 16:11:23 This snake oil sales man has you all fooled.... 
4391 2018-01-31 16:11:20 This is so offensive to anyone who's ever lived in L.A. but also "no old-line families," too few rich/oil CEOs filling "civic roles" as problems lol *falls over laughing*
4392 2018-01-31 16:11:11 hahah i use oil and vinegar or lemon juice
4393 2018-01-31 16:11:06 Oil or acrylic? Looking good.

Not to talk of physical and environmental development...

"I pledge to Nigeria......" my black ass...

Lemme see opportunity first. .. I'll just betray this country...
4400 2018-01-31 16:10:35 No, it was an attempt to join 1st world nations again.

But healthcare services are the biggest industry in the country. For-profit healthcare spends more on lobbying than coal and oil combined.

So stupid people will think it's better to make healthcare for the wealthy alone.

4402 2018-01-31 16:10:21 I am a HUGE fan of crock pot food, so I have several. My favorites are:

Caramelized Onions

Fill the crock pot to the brim with sliced onions, add a few tablespoons of oil and a bit of salt and sugar as desired. Cook a minimum of 12 hours and freeze any leftovers.
4403 2018-01-31 16:10:18 What was the the unemployment rate when Obama started?  The DOW jones at?  The housing market at?  Price of oil at?  And what were they when he ended his term?
4404 2018-01-31 16:10:16 Well, I almost put baby oil on my toothbrush this morning, luckily as I was squeezing the bottle I noticed my toothpaste still on the counter... phew... that would have been interesting
4405 2018-01-31 16:10:16 I would appreciate information on getting Nigeria oil sector data for 2017. Data sets which include Daily, monthly,weekly and yearly overall information on Nigeria crude oil production (including specific petroleum products such as PMS, AGO, HHK). Please Retweet. Thanks @BudgITng
4406 2018-01-31 16:10:14 エクストラバージンオイルってなんか卑猥だよね。
4407 2018-01-31 16:10:11 its more complex . SAA Iran and Russia are rushing to break siege on 2 government enclaves in idlib, if they get their they basically have idlib cut into pieces and their oil pipeline cut, then they will impose a no fly zone in #afrin in a weeks time #YPG can hold till then
4408 2018-01-31 16:10:11 Been on for a few months now. I’m tired of it tho
4409 2018-01-31 16:10:05 Easy way to get fat in diet & be satisfied. I just like the way it tastes. Unsalted  Butter + MCT oil + coffee— BLENDED IN BLENDER or don’t bother drinking it.
4410 2018-01-31 16:09:54 Very interesting. Do you think the momentum has shifted for oil supplies and prices with US producer adding more rigs as reported in news?
4411 2018-01-31 16:09:49 What in Venezuela is in anyway applicable to the UK? Since you mentioned it, you must have some insight as to what exactly is happening there? 
OPEC doing to Venezuela as they did USSR
Suppressing oil market
Apparently, the likes of BRICS aren't feeling it like US & UAE

4416 2018-01-31 16:09:32 That oil money is something in manchester boy
4417 2018-01-31 16:09:20 Nowww you on that cryto wave
4418 2018-01-31 16:09:19 tldr though; it's a mushroom dish with tofu (and pork mince normally) with an oyster sauce and this.... cabbage root, I think? You fry it in oil, first it'd be the pork but mushrooms/root in this case. Tofu late, in chunks, be gentle or it'll fall apart.
4419 2018-01-31 16:09:07 No. You're wrong. If you actually do some research you will know this is more US propaganda a la Iraq to get us into yet another war for oil & gas. Same shit different day.
4420 2018-01-31 16:09:01 Surely they realize that the SDF’s grip on power in Deir Ezzor, where the most valuable oil fields are, isn’t that strong? It wouldn’t be that hard for Damascus to get the tribes in Deir Ezzor to side with them over the SDF.
4421 2018-01-31 16:08:57 Haha what have I said about the oil money running out?
4422 2018-01-31 16:08:55 I strongly believe that I just made salad and used frying oil for dressing but I ate it all anyways.
4423 2018-01-31 16:08:45 CBD oil for all? House just passed bill that, in effect, legalizes CBD oil for all. Goes to the Senate now.
4424 2018-01-31 16:08:42 Steam. But I'm going to disagree w/everyone. Most fries have enough oil on them that you usually don't need extra if you oven re-heat at 425

4426 2018-01-31 16:08:27 Not if tRump has anything to say about it. He wants cars to go back to 18 mpg so they use more oil so him and his rich buddies make more money.
4427 2018-01-31 16:08:07 Good build quality, amazing engine and brakes, shitty gearbox, weird diff, wooden suspension. Eats pads and rear tires, thirsty for gas and oil. Makes u smile a lot. If only that gearbox...
4428 2018-01-31 16:08:03 He's right $55 WTI oil is the sweet spot for consumers/producers.

4430 2018-01-31 16:07:51 At the peak  of the housing bubble "smart investors" were paying too much. Oil at one point was $150 a barrel. NFL has saturated the market, a poor overall on the field  product, plus millennials don't seem to care. Tough sledding ahead.

4433 2018-01-31 16:07:40 If this is the story of the son of Globacom owner, Adenuga, throwing away Nigeria's stolen money in order to dupe Nigeria with his Trojan oil company, there is really nothing to learn.
4434 2018-01-31 16:07:38 A real Italian pizza doesn't even have ketchup, just nan with oil! Maybe some garlic if being fancy.
4435 2018-01-31 16:07:24 Does anyone know of an oil that’s good for taking off makeup and isn’t coconut oil?? I’m almost out of my Clinique take the day off balm and I don’t have the money to buy more rn.

4440 2018-01-31 16:07:07 My voice professor in college is 89 now, and still has the most beautiful skin I have ever seen. Her secret? Drink water... a lot of it. She uses one skincare product to clean, remove makeup, and moisturize... olive oil (and a very warm washcloth).
4441 2018-01-31 16:06:52 I guess we do have oil. It would happen.
4442 2018-01-31 16:06:28 I'm pretty sure the only time he's ever been in an auto shop was when he was waiting for an oil change on his Bentley.
4443 2018-01-31 16:06:24 Can’t oil a soul food restaurant in upscale majority white neighborhood. Also can’t put it in Atlanta where market is super over saturated.
4444 2018-01-31 16:06:21 When oil can be distributed rather than water.
4445 2018-01-31 16:06:18 Seeing how he campaigned on marijuana of course he will focus on it, that's base that got him in not the oil base.
4446 2018-01-31 16:06:05 maybe add like oil next time? not like i constantly commented that on your live xxxxx
4447 2018-01-31 16:05:41 So when the dollar gets weak since the US stock market trades in dollars, the market should go up if the economy is doing ok. but Oil which trades in dollars should go up with commodity prices

4452 2018-01-31 16:05:13 Efficascent oil is the shit
4453 2018-01-31 16:05:11 I spilled half a bottle of @TOMFORD perfume on me today which is actually more expensive than the BP oil spill of 2010. Can confirm I’m the best smelling person in London right now though
4454 2018-01-31 16:05:04 These are all actually . I stumbled upon these in the hair store one day. I cannot do coconut oil alone. My hair feels like trash afterwards.

Pay within 10 days and get 5 cents off per gallon!
4458 2018-01-31 16:04:23 if you get it organic where the oil is separated at the top, like the type where you have to mix it yourself, you have to keep it in the fridge cause there’s not enough preservatives..... but if it’s skippy’s or some shit then he wack
4459 2018-01-31 16:04:17 Oh bugger!  Thermals on and duvets around you all tonight or at least until the oil company decides to deliver.
4460 2018-01-31 16:04:15 They new about it at least 5 years ago thats when the started building the new oil terminal in Shetland for that particular field they spent many hundreds of millions on it also I worked on the field 3 years ago on a rig called the Clair and Clair ridge

4474 2018-01-31 16:02:32 because they're reliant on texture as part of its ultimate flavor profile meaning the best way to get mileage out of your fries is to put 'em in the oven with some oil on top to re-crisp 'em

4479 2018-01-31 16:02:10 need to go get the oil changed on my car, then pay $300 for the tags 
4480 2018-01-31 16:02:10 #PremierOil #PMO recent weakness seems to have stalled at the 50 day moving average finding support. Momentum downwards has stalled too. I topped up on support. I believe the trend is up & fundamentals due to recent #Brent strength if sustained all year undervalue PMO #oil

4485 2018-01-31 16:01:25 #Oil insiders plan on between 50-70 years of high profit production. Many inside OIl itself are pushing their companies toward diversification. The fact that Scotland plans to use exports of high profit oil whilst preparing for a non-carbon future is good govt.
4486 2018-01-31 16:01:15 They’ve all been told that ‘data is the new oil’ so they just hoard data with no idea what it actually is and what to even do with it

4496 2018-01-31 16:00:37 I checked today's oil price, BB. It was at $69.18 this morning. They'll tell us because of fluctuating prices it's too volatile for us to benefit from - Better if all our "useless" wealth is left with them. I'd rather  Scotland had 100% at any fluctuating price than 0% we get now
4497 2018-01-31 16:00:27 a lot of that weakness is coming from oil and energy sector
4498 2018-01-31 16:00:25 Add all oil and gas that comes via pipeline from ne bc.  30% royalty. Why is the ndp so useless they do nothing to fight for alberta
4499 2018-01-31 16:00:19 My body and hair loves coconut oil but I know it ain’t for everybody.
4500 2018-01-31 16:00:18 Thank you for serving. Like my WWII father said about the ME wars, " These are Not our wars". Why do people think our soldiers are committing suicide at such a high rate? We should never put our soldiers in harms way over Big Oil, Big Banks and Corp's.

4502 2018-01-31 16:00:04 The can't get OIL into their country. Their economy is totally wrecked by sanctions. That leads to a poor quality of life and people dying. I'm not in the PSL lol I'm not an ML. But that doesn't mean that I think sanctions on DPRK are good U.S. should leave them the fuck alone

4506 2018-01-31 15:59:54 Trump only cares about Venezuela cause of the oil
4507 2018-01-31 15:59:52 But the sticking issue is not oil, its Palestine/Israel/Zionism/ Evangelical Christians. This issue must be reconsidered not through the eyes of the mentioned groups but through wiser  independent political thinking in order to make most people like rather than hate the USA. 3
4508 2018-01-31 15:59:49 rosehip seed oil is perfect for oily skin, it can help regulate oil production & it's a source of vitamin a to help heal hyperpigmentation & increase cell turnover
4509 2018-01-31 15:59:49 Oh yeah. Before WW2, the Nazis stockpiled coal and converted key military infrastructure to run on “clean coal”, anticipating gas and oil shortage because Germany has lots of coal. But the process requires HUGE amounts of coal and couldn’t get it out of the ground fast enough.

4523 2018-01-31 15:57:30 we can only admire their big works made with materials like oil on canvas, hard precision work drawn on the walls and ceilings of the churches. Notice in every single work, there is the angelic fugure rendered in human likeness.
4524 2018-01-31 15:57:24 OH NO... BP have found even more of that horrible black sticky oil stuff below the north sea. That will be  another big drain on the hard pressed Scottish tax payers.... as long as Westminster controls our affairs.
4525 2018-01-31 15:57:22 It is less easy to recyle than other solutions as shown by the fact it is not recyclable in many local authorities. It is only 100% recyclable once as the plastic comes out of cycle to be used in single use building materials and it is non-renewable using oil derived plastics.

4537 2018-01-31 15:56:17 Essential oils have so many benefits if you use them correctly. There are some oils that you should not diffuse at all. Make sure you check before you diffuse or ingest any oil. It can be very harmful to you and others
4538 2018-01-31 15:56:10 Did you know that if you spray a little peanut oil on asparagus before you cook it, it makes it easier to slide it in the trash.

4540 2018-01-31 15:55:56 I had watched a very interesting video clip a good few months ago and there was a geologist on it talking along a similar vein, he said as the oil comes/produced at the earths core, which means it is very unlikely that it will run out anytime soon! Blue/red tories pedlars of lies
4541 2018-01-31 15:55:53 I hate it in all forms except tossed in olive oil, lightly garlic salted, and roasted on a baking pan in the oven. Those kale chips are addictive SO GOOD.
4542 2018-01-31 15:55:51 My apologies to use car salesman! I should’ve said he’s a snake oil salesman!
4543 2018-01-31 15:55:50 Chamomile or peppermint tea is great for a subtle soothing effect! Also, adding a few drops of lavender essential oil into the shower (or bath) for an aromatherapy soak. Aaannd the Headspace app (better than Calm imo) always helps a lot. <3
4544 2018-01-31 15:55:47 same but bio oil is helping
4545 2018-01-31 15:55:46 Alberta and BC will get their shit together and never have another NDP government. New carbon tax, sell oil at 50% discount, economy killer and anti environmental only to name a few. Let's all get out and vote next election.

4556 2018-01-31 15:54:34 My gran was a perfectly healthy smoker until she wasn't ;)

Try peanut oil - it's quite a fatty oil but damned good on homemade baked chips.
4557 2018-01-31 15:54:28 As oil only USA is producing 10m barrel a day, add other sources of petroleum they say USA needs only 3m more barrels a day, that USA imports from Canada and Mexico. So hopefully USA will not fight another war in the middle East for oil. 2
4558 2018-01-31 15:54:17 it depends on the sanctions. For example, look at the DPRK. They aren't even allowed to get oil into their country. They aren't allowed to export many minerals, including iron and coal. They can't export seafood. Any ship that enters a N. Korean port cannot enter us for 180 days
4559 2018-01-31 15:54:17 Need an oil change

4567 2018-01-31 15:52:40 Daughter-in-law was geologist/geo-scientist that did North Sea core sampling & told me years ago that oil would go on for YEARS & YEARS & was RECOVERABLE.

4591 2018-01-31 15:49:41 That is why they did in mid-2014 ahead of the 2015 election, but the oil price was collapsing then, and when 90%+ of exports and over 50% of budget revenues comes from oil .. that made sense.

4593 2018-01-31 15:49:37 @FrankLuntz it would be a bit  disingenuous for one to believe that Trump is a snake oil salesman who would destroy the pillars of democracy if he could and yet cheer when he touts his snake oil on TV (while using the speech for campaign donations BTW).
4594 2018-01-31 15:49:35 lol #US didnt train guys in #Afrin afrin was overseen by #Russia  you guys have about 5 days before #HTS show how unreliable mercenary's become when their home is under threat and they head back south to stop #SAA taking roads into #Idlib city and generally cutting oil sales
4595 2018-01-31 15:49:31 Do you grease them or just use oil for racing since they are overhauled often?
4596 2018-01-31 15:49:22 When Scotland eventually runs out of oil (still a long way off), will WM and the MSM still clamber over themselves to keep Scotland in this supposed 'Family of Nations' Union?
4597 2018-01-31 15:49:18 Okay mom can we not tell the guy who’s giving me an oil change how drunk I got last night. Let me live.
4598 2018-01-31 15:49:17 This is probably the reason they built the new oil terminal on Shetland. You don't build a new terminal if the oil is running out

4608 2018-01-31 15:48:19 I tried to find a straight GIF showing a real order -- that was the least awful one. 
My point was that Trump can take action if he wants to. He chooses his priorities. Like oil drilling off our beaches vs. funding CHIP, or building wall vs building roads/bridges.
4609 2018-01-31 15:47:50 Of course they did.
High time @scotgov were more astute.

4614 2018-01-31 15:47:14 Never even heard of this. Does it surprise me? No. Why is this not talked about/taught? I guess it is not in the interest of the English/Tories/Scot Tories to do so. Keep the Scots in the dark (but let's keep them in the 'union' - we need their oil, whiskey, fishing (salmon) etc.
4615 2018-01-31 15:47:12 But buying oil from a corrupt government doesn’t help the people, our humanitarian aid will
4616 2018-01-31 15:47:07 Tea tree oil is not a moisturizer, it’s an anti fungal.. so do not expect it to moisturize your skin it can dry it out

4620 2018-01-31 15:46:38 Please help the people of Kansas, they are trying to make CBD oil illegal in Kansas.  It has helped so many people, don't let them take this away from us. I'm begging you!!!!
4621 2018-01-31 15:46:36 He has too much invested in oil and putin...
4622 2018-01-31 15:46:32 Use some oil off the motor dip stick to get gloss going lol.
4623 2018-01-31 15:46:09 And let’s get unemployed Americans off of welfare, yet don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.
4624 2018-01-31 15:46:09 @KSAGOffice AG Derek Schmidt: equating CBD oil to Marijuana is like banning poppy seed muffins as Opioids. Do some research other than Big Pharma or watching 'Reefer Madness', and stop making our state the butt of everyone's jokes!
4625 2018-01-31 15:46:02 Yeah! I use my home made chilli oil for that.

4627 2018-01-31 15:45:55 More oil to your head sir, the same thing I have been telling people. They only rotate the abundance to create an impression that light has improved generally, it hasn't....bottom line.
4628 2018-01-31 15:45:41 How’ve you lumped united in with those two oil clubs? Why would we need creative accounting to spend what we do, when we out earn every team in the world?

4630 2018-01-31 15:45:35 Wow. I can't help laughing at this show of people who truly aren't about their job. EPA invested in oil, coal, and drilling. DOE about privatizing education and harming public schools.  FEMA not providing emergency aid. HUD not helping the housing crisis. On and on.
4631 2018-01-31 15:45:33 항상 응원할께요
4632 2018-01-31 15:45:13 I'll have a couple of oil filters and sump washers please.
4633 2018-01-31 15:45:07 Most essential oil diffusers and those glade plug ins stuff and wax burners are really not good for your animals especially if they’re plugged in the outlets that are at their level of breathing
4634 2018-01-31 15:45:03 Humans have relied on limited, high-labor fossil fuels (coal, oil, etc.) for centuries. The world's economy is based on it.

With the impending domination of free solar power, all fossil fuel wealth (top 10% of humans) will be worthless. They know that, and they're panicking.
4635 2018-01-31 15:45:02 Today in 2009 in Kenya, at least 113 people are killed and over 200 injured following an oil spillage ignition in Molo, days after a massive fire at a Nakumatt supermarket in Nairobi killed at least 25 people
4636 2018-01-31 15:44:48 This is not reflecting in the prices of food in the market Groundnut Oil, Garri, Beans, Rice, Palm Oil, Yam, Irish Potato, nobody can afford it
4637 2018-01-31 15:44:45 Seen there that oil mcburnie linked might just be rumours, just have to wait and see
4638 2018-01-31 15:44:44 Libertarian-ism != greed. It's more a case of individual freedom, as opposed to collectivism (e.g license permit raj). Libertarians can act for the larger good, out of charitable instincts, or because of fear.
Think Elon Musk, rather than Oil baron.

4644 2018-01-31 15:44:27 We'll see more drops in gasoline inventories as turnarounds start and refiners move high RVP out of the chain, leading to #oil builds
4645 2018-01-31 15:44:21 Oil me are still arguing that they won’t break their wage structure whilst spending half a billion in 18 months... 
4646 2018-01-31 15:44:20 @X929 @seannajefferson @Andrew_Beckler If the popcorn kettle is cast-iron then it shouldn't see a drop of dish soap. Just a quick wipe down with a hot wet cloth is good. The 18 years of oil will season the pot and enhance the flavour.

4659 2018-01-31 15:43:25 You are good at spewing ad hominem, but that gets you nowhere. Come now...Nigeria is the sixth largest producer of oil in the world, but what do you have to show for it? It's not the U.S. Government who has stolen from you,
4660 2018-01-31 15:43:20 I’m a use castor oil instead of biotin for my hair growth bc when I used to take biotin, my hair grew fast everywhere

4666 2018-01-31 15:43:09 The Democrats just aren't buying the snake oil Trump's selling. He even took credit for the low unemployment rates for blacks. What on earth did he do to accomplish that? Absolutely nothing.
4667 2018-01-31 15:43:09 That $27.70 is the discount to WTI, not the price per barrel. (The price would then be ~$37 per barrel) Also, taxes have increased. There's no magical "oil was this gas should be this"
4668 2018-01-31 15:43:05 I need to go get a oil change soon as I get out this class
4669 2018-01-31 15:42:55 I remember the oil crisis in the 1970s, when the Saudis flexed their muscles and put in place an oil embargo. It wasn't a fun time. 

It's nice to be idealistic about Middle East politics & trade, but when the fuel supplies dry up, so will voter idealism.

4721 2018-01-31 15:38:19 EIA inventory report not terribly bearish however it might be the end of the road for Oil’s ascent for a while. The net long speculation overloaded may become problematic in the coming weeks if we see more builds and higher production.

4885 2018-01-31 15:27:56 @BJP4India Control petrol, Diesel and LPG prices. Common man is suffering. If oil prices reduces means other general commodities price will reduce.
4886 2018-01-31 15:27:56 My one full day off all month (except I still have a meeting) is going to be spent getting an oil change. Adulting is wild
4887 2018-01-31 15:27:52 1)Pathetic commentary on once great Canada: eastern Canada imports of Saudi oil skyrocketing???  Why do eastern Cdns prefer to send $billions to terrorist supporting countries while those same >99% Muslim countries refuse to accept any refugees fleeing Muslim countries!!
4888 2018-01-31 15:27:52 i tried making a roasted veggie salad today for the first time and it was so good.  roasted brussel sprouts, broccoli and red pepper with a dressing of balsamic vinegar and olive oil

4894 2018-01-31 15:27:27 Other Harold ?'s: have you seen regulations that Trump has reduced in the oil/gas field and has it helped? What about the environmental impact?

4898 2018-01-31 15:26:55 Today, an important grade of Canadian oil (#WCS), is selling for $28.40 USD less than the main North American benchmark (WTI) at $64.14 USD.

Canadian natural gas (#AECO) is selling for $1.29 CAD, compared to US natural gas (NYMEX) at $3.05 USD. @AndrewScheer #Cdnpoli
4899 2018-01-31 15:26:52 I know Tom, the Russia investigation is absurd.  Couldn't agree more.  And the whole George Bush Cheney oil grab rumors and Halliburton it just all seems a bit far fetched.  Because it's not conspiracy if it comes from the left I guess?
4900 2018-01-31 15:26:36 lrt i use an oil mix: coconut, jojoba, sweet almond, castor, & tea tree oils. no exact measurements. my fav oils to use alone on my hair are either sweet almond or avocado.
4901 2018-01-31 15:26:31 Your “double/triple” the price is one of the stupidest comments I have read on Twitter (and that’s says a lot.). The free market would supply as a better price option then forcing us to buy oil at “double/triple” the price from Alberta... again BC isn’t landlocked!
4902 2018-01-31 15:26:26 Needs to be applied to highly environmentally damaging imported almond, soya & palm oil products too.
4903 2018-01-31 15:26:24 it helped a bit! i still have to use a couple of oil sheets, pero much less compared to my old toner (the human nature ones). it closed my pores and lightened most of my hyperpigmentation tho, so feel ko it's worth it talaga for its price.
4904 2018-01-31 15:26:22 @DonaldTrump A GREAT PRESIDENT KNOWS WHAT IS RIGHT FOR THE COUNTRY AND MAKES IT HAPPEN. LINCOLN WAS NOT MASSIVELY POPULAR....TRUMAN HAD SIMILAR CHALLENGES.  TODAY, YOU NEED TO CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE "OIL STATES" SUPREME COURT DECISION.  THEY WANT TO MAKE MY IDEA THE PUBLIC'S..NO!
4905 2018-01-31 15:26:11 Ok, what's the thing that sticks up on the right side, opposite the distributor?  It looks like it has a valve cover on top and another one on the right side.  It looks like it joins the crank case and it's part of the oil volume.  But I'm totally mystified.
4906 2018-01-31 15:25:48 Yea and she has this dope ass oil that she makes .. A1!
4907 2018-01-31 15:25:36 Wow I guess republicans will believe anything. The great white hope comes to mind when I see this type of reality show. When you abandon all you have fought for just to feed this egomaniac you have reached a new low.What's next snake oil? Oh yea he allready sold you that.  #SOTU
4908 2018-01-31 15:25:30 So the truth comes out, BC entire argument is...I got enough oil for my car, fuck off.... thank you for admitting the truth!
‘And the truth shall set you free!’ Don’t you feel better now?
4909 2018-01-31 15:25:16 The situation at Chelsea FC is hilarious and ungodly aggravating. Multi-billionaire owner and successful oil tycoon. Head coach in Conte who you could comepare to Belichick but a board (GM) the equivalent of fucking Matt Millen. And of course Conte will be the one fired.

4918 2018-01-31 15:24:28 I’ve participated in many professional discussions abt hydraulic fracturing. Oil/gas companies don’t have to disclose to regulators the “proprietary” chemical injected. 

They estimate if they’ve “recovered” the water & chemical by how much is pumped back out. 

Regs are WEAK.
4919 2018-01-31 15:24:28 Obama was idealistic--wanted everyone to have healthcare. Trump's in it for himself. Cheney was too, W. was just the lazy C student with no moral or political vision. Nice guy, but nothing, & pushed into war for a pipeline for Afghan oil. Clinton lied abt BJ. No equivalencies!2/2
4920 2018-01-31 15:24:20 I usually have super oily skin and I read somewhere to fight oil with oil and someone on the blog post or whatever said to use it  (maybe don’t trust random blog posts ???)

He didn’t fire everyone that got close to seeing any wrongdoing. They tried to find wrongdoing.

4995 2018-01-31 15:16:41 Ahahahaha ... yes, removing regulations is mysteriously going to make it cheaper and easier to upgrade Alberta oil to light, sweet crude levels. You have no idea what you're talking about Gary.

5022 2018-01-31 15:13:15 Have you tried diluting it with a little bit of olive oil or grape juice? Could be the concentration of the oil that’s causing them to be sick. But thanks for the advice, will keep them away from that diffuser when it’s running.

5027 2018-01-31 15:12:43 The senior city manager also noted that #KinderMorgan 's risk assessment is "flawed" and does not provide the full extent of the potential dangers of an oil spill "by excluding high consequence events (such as a tanker spill in Burrard Inlet)". #transmountain
5028 2018-01-31 15:12:40 So we should stay with Empire, backed by ther petro-dollar? So Venezuela cannot sell oil under their own land using a currency not dictated by Empire? No, we the free people are behind the $Petro. Not for riches but for it stands for.

5044 2018-01-31 15:09:47 Thank you Mr. president, but we need more sanctions against the dictator Nicolas Maduro and their families that are living like kings and queens in USA, like Maria Gabriela Chavez. Also, the USA should stop buying oil from Venezuela @realDonaldTrump

5054 2018-01-31 15:08:39 You need a close to competition oil derivatives market in order to have a pass-through of oil prices to the trucking business. This would provide clear market signals that responds the economy and not to market power.

5078 2018-01-31 15:05:59 Personally I am not a big fans of brinksmanship - everyone loses.  But if refining the oil before transport is off the table because #bigoil causes all the shots, well then increased bitumen transport to BC is also off the table.  Refining the oil is a reasonable request...

5083 2018-01-31 15:05:38 EIA reports US #oil inventories at 10:30am on Wednesdays. If Mon. is holiday in US, #EIA reports on Thurs. at 11. This is the most important weekly moment for #oilprice. Based on the expectation built into the price (by #API Tuesday 4:30 report), EIA report can change oil price.
5084 2018-01-31 15:05:31 If something changes.. try a drop of peppermint oil on each temple and the back of your neck. Works wonders & ya smell nice lol
5085 2018-01-31 15:05:24 Chapstick could be making them worse. Use a sugar scrub on your lips and apply plain Vaseline or coconut oil. Sugar scrub will exfoliate the dead skin off and will moisturize your lips and not the dead skin lol

5091 2018-01-31 15:04:49 Not surprising. The quantity of industrial marijuana kitchens in AK doesn’t have the capacity to produce the extracts & oils for the quantity of shops/edibles sold in Alaska. No one on the board/regulation side has done this math. I’d consider all edible & oil products suspect.

I say, how could that be?  In today's global economy, it can be sold or traded for other commodities.

How this trade is conducted is left to the  political administration in power to handle.

Because it is a state entity.
5101 2018-01-31 15:03:05 Carnival Con selling snake oil and empty promises!
5102 2018-01-31 15:03:04 Off shore drilling is inherently expensive, oil prices will need to go up for it to expand at any meaningful pace. We have been an exporter of energy for a while, with nearly 1.7 million barrels of oil in Oct 2017 and will become a net exporter by 2026
5103 2018-01-31 15:03:04 The Russians want to break up the EU and negotiate oil separately, so they can charge more.

In exchange for not going to war over there, he's given up 2 million acres of American national parks for the oil boys to play with, instead.
I hope you get what I'm saying, here.

5167 2018-01-31 14:55:26 This looks like a dish I make.  Coleslaw from a bag, with random amounts of olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  Yum.  No  though might add it #vegan #learningcurve

5170 2018-01-31 14:55:12 Yes. Preferably coconut oil.
5171 2018-01-31 14:55:11 I use lavender essential oil every morning and night for "perfume".  I love it!
5172 2018-01-31 14:55:06 Well that's a new one for me. I just bought an Olive Oil subscription 

I am a proud supporter of @fatgoldoliveoil and anything else that @robinsloan produces. 

@robinsloan Still waiting for that Annabel Scheme followup or screenplay though

5177 2018-01-31 14:54:54 Feb. 14... while I still live in a land of dead things, in the southern part of the US, the cobwebs are getting shaken off, and the smell of oil on fresh leather mitts fills clubhouses. Pine tar, long hidden away for the winter finds its way to new Ashen Baseball bats.

5182 2018-01-31 14:54:33 It’s fucking 29 degrees outside and the oil heat that I paid $297 for isn’t fucking working. 

I’m running god damn space heaters. 

Pissed is an understatement for what I feel right now.
5183 2018-01-31 14:54:09 I'm not sure babe. I tak familiar dgn Shu Uemera punya products. Sorry 

Other oils pun boleh jadi punca. Tak semestinya mineral oil sahaja.

If takde product yg sesuai, u boleh do manually jugak guna your own oil blend.
5184 2018-01-31 14:54:09 Honestly same, tea tree oil is my shiiit
5185 2018-01-31 14:53:58 None of them, that’s the point. My friend Eduardo made $300,000 betting oil futures one summer and Eduardo won’t come close to getting in. The ability to make money doesn’t impress anybody around here.
5186 2018-01-31 14:53:54 And the oil hidden under the Clyde!

5205 2018-01-31 14:52:08 Don’t forget that Israel and USA created ISIS.
ISIS was pumping out Syrian oil and selling it with the help of Americans and the Israelis. Russia, Iran and Syria had a pipeline deal which USA and Israel didn’t like. Hence the war. Russia has every right to protect its interests.

5209 2018-01-31 14:51:36 You know doterra or even young living aren’t the only brands that have lab reports available for each and every oil showing their sources and purity. You don’t gotta do the pyramid deal if you don’t want to.

5215 2018-01-31 14:51:09 I think his point is: 

piping enough oil/gas so he has gas for his car = an acceptable risk

Piping more oil than he needs for his own car = too dangerous must be stopped!!!

How convenient ...
5216 2018-01-31 14:51:00 I took a new type of fish oil pill this morning and I think it’s ruined fish in general for me forever

5218 2018-01-31 14:50:47 I hate getting oil changes because I have to waste 30 minutes to an hour of my time walking around Walmart for no reason

5221 2018-01-31 14:50:29 Why do they have tea tree oil in sprays for dogs then?
5222 2018-01-31 14:50:24 holy you old hag, get a frigging clue the days of the dinosaurs is over roll over and turn to oil at least then you would be useful
5223 2018-01-31 14:50:06 I mix coconut oil with my body lotion. Been doing it for a while & my skin is softer than a baby’s

5228 2018-01-31 14:49:24 More money for big oil companies. That means gas prices go up so we can pay for it.
5229 2018-01-31 14:49:20 I think it's a panic buy for Manchester city and Leicester should hold out for atleast 70 million 
Most likely it will happen but I can't understand that they never had money for Sanchez..maybe they made a profit by selling couple of oil barrels they have

5233 2018-01-31 14:48:48 On @LagosTalks913 at 4.15pm as usual with @Ore_Onile - probably discussing the Oil price, @followlasg 2018 Budget and why rich people are leaving Lagos.
5234 2018-01-31 14:48:34 When you’re under attack, just relax. 

“You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows” (Psalm 23:5 NIV).
5235 2018-01-31 14:48:27 not only thatour oil was running out but it was worthless as well! 
5236 2018-01-31 14:48:27 Err, Independence does not = not trading with rUK. Where will England get it’s oil, gas, whisky, electricity, seafood, water, nuclear dumps?

5237 2018-01-31 14:48:08 Take an oil safety class! Doterra is not a trustworthy brand either because 1)they don’t tell you how to use them unless you go to a class
2)they don’t warn you about the risks oils have
5238 2018-01-31 14:48:06 So I haven’t tried coconut oil before, but how did it get so popular if everybody saying it is trash now ? 
5239 2018-01-31 14:47:45 EVERY SINGLE VOTER can "see quite clearly" that "by voting GOP," it is a VOTE AGAINST the ENVIRONMENT, a vote TOWARDS more Climate Change and the "superstorms" created by the GOP Fracking agenda. Just to "export oil to Asia?" 

*That is what the GOP stands for. 

"Selling out."
5240 2018-01-31 14:47:40 Then stop spending money on oil exploration in the north and fight insurgency completely, must North have oil, b comfortable with agriculture
5241 2018-01-31 14:47:29 Historically, there have been more accidents transporting oil by rail. Congratulations Trevor! You finally got something right.
5242 2018-01-31 14:47:28 It’s pretty much a basic stir fry. I seared the pork loin in a chili sesame oil and then added the veg and some garlic. The sauce is just 1 part honey to 1 part sriracha. Add soy sauce to taste. For an extra kick add a little ginger.
5243 2018-01-31 14:47:06 Modi government's advantage was low oil prices but now oil prices climbing. Disadvantage OROP,7th pay commission

That’s what I use and it’s so good
5247 2018-01-31 14:46:57 Not everywhere wars are about resources. Oil, water, or gold were not always a motive for war. 
Sometimes just religion and sometimes nationalism

5253 2018-01-31 14:46:30 People still falling for the coconut oil I’m screaming
5254 2018-01-31 14:46:23 In oil, or "just" stockbroking?
5255 2018-01-31 14:46:20 Yeah as long as you mix the oil with an agent such as alcohol, jojoba, sweet almond, etc. it’s much safer/less astringent. People should always err on the side of caution when exposing their pets to any pure substances though. Not all bad info, but a little misleading  
5256 2018-01-31 14:46:09 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, yet beaten to death with a hammer.
5257 2018-01-31 14:45:56 Currently using face oil from marzea shop. Feels my skin so good even it takes time to make my scar gone but love it. Plus its homemade.
5258 2018-01-31 14:45:50 There are eatables and you can vapor the oil so no smell. So If it can be used without bothering you why do you care?

5269 2018-01-31 14:43:45 Because it's a trade-off in favor of the benefits the "poison" creates. Like coal to electricity or oil to fuel vehicles.
5270 2018-01-31 14:43:44 It's cuz of fucking oil,  dude... 
5271 2018-01-31 14:43:34 2T coconut oil 
1/2T shea butter
1t baking soda(aluminum free)
Optionally add a fee drops of essential oil (thats meant for skin)
Lavender, cedarwood and patchouli are great 

Best natural and inexpensive deodorant 

Double boil coconut oil&shea before mixing
Whip if desired
5272 2018-01-31 14:43:26 That's not surprising. Even w/o that, the simple facts are enough to at least bring criminal charges in some form. Such as the fact that the Bushes are in bed w/ the Bin Ladens & have major foreign oil investments points to their collusion.

5276 2018-01-31 14:43:11 That's a lot of barells of oil 
5277 2018-01-31 14:43:03 Quotas set by the U.N. allow for around 540,000 tonnes of crude oil a year to be delivered to North Korea from China & over 60,000 tonnes of oil products from Russia, China & other countries #Oil #NorthKorea #UnitedNations
5278 2018-01-31 14:42:57 One of my family's favorite meals is Penne with olive oil, garlic plus fresh tomatoes and fresh basil from our garden. We serve it with fresh fish and a salad.
5279 2018-01-31 14:42:52 Oh boy... That didn't take long, did it? Rational thinking takes a left turn and it's a capitalist conspiracy. The oil market is a global market. Global money goes wherever global leaders decide. No doubt some goes where we'd prefer it not. How do you fix that?

5289 2018-01-31 14:41:46 Delivery of oil to North Korea should not be reduced, Moscow’s ambassador to Pyongyang was cited as saying, adding that a total end to deliveries would be interpreted by North Korea as an act of war #Oil #NorthKorea #Russia #politics
5290 2018-01-31 14:41:26 Same as BC is fixing the oil & gas industry.
5291 2018-01-31 14:41:20 The recent decline in the U.S. dollar and upswing in oil prices should boost inflation in coming months.
5292 2018-01-31 14:41:18 TRUMP CLAIM: "We are now an exporter of energy to the world."

OUR TAKE: Mostly spin

WHY: The U.S. has exported energy -- from crude oil to natural gas to coal -- for a long time.
5293 2018-01-31 14:41:01 If you can stand the mess, we love playing in cous cous and lentils and I found a lovely recipe for coconut sand. I invested in a tuff tray and oil cloths which make messy play a lot easier to contain! If you google ‘the imagination tree’ there are some fab ideas on there!

5304 2018-01-31 14:39:52 Hahaha oil foul.
5305 2018-01-31 14:39:47 Basra would have got a generous per-capita share under Oil for Food perhaps.  Basra Regional Government under Chalabi and SCIRI. Saddam-stan in the middle with Sadrists plotting an uprising. Gulf States and Turkey would have been freaking out.
5306 2018-01-31 14:39:39 Well, I got up just past 5 b/c I'd knocked my ass out w/ 2 tranqs. But since I have no work today & am still only doing shitty oil paintings, I think other than exercising I'll spend the day in bed reading.

Tea Tree oil is good for the hair bc it usually combats hair and scalp problems from antibacteria, like dandruff.

5318 2018-01-31 14:38:17 At some point, when the cookies crumbles beyond rescue, they will be forced to make and enforce laws that aren't favorable to them.  This was why I wished oil prices never rose. If it remained at $30 pbl, govt will be forced to do the inevitable.

5339 2018-01-31 14:35:15 Ok so we don't like coconut oil anymore? Is that what I'm seeing?
5340 2018-01-31 14:35:14 This is a poorly constructed tweet imo. Tea tree oil (along with other essential oils such as peppermint, lavender, citronella, and more) can be used on animals in a completely safe and healthy manner.
5341 2018-01-31 14:35:07 Wow! I'm absolutely astonished! I knew olive oil has a lot of uses... And everyday I learn about more and more uses of this liquid gold! #Amazing

5352 2018-01-31 14:34:02 @MSNBC This lady that's on now, is s full of it it's unbelievable. First she shows shots from the Obama shutdown an tries to relate them to Trump. Then tries to refute the Presidents statement about the U.S. exporting oil, talk about fake news.

5357 2018-01-31 14:33:26 Just look at what Norway has done with its oil revenue. I read the fund it set up for future generations tops £1trillion !
5358 2018-01-31 14:33:26 This will flood the market with snake oil expensive treatments that don’t work, bilking families of their last dollar with false hopes of a cure. I don’t think an open ended right to try bill will pass.
5359 2018-01-31 14:33:14 People assume if Canada exports more than 1 oil tanker / wk will be spills, but importing oil by tanker is not a risk.

5362 2018-01-31 14:32:33 The relevance is built in years, nowadays it takes money, as a football fan i disagree with it, but when PSG and Barca howl hundreds of millions on a individual.. you can’t judge.. at the end of the day, oil money or not, you need to spend to win.
5363 2018-01-31 14:32:32 The very point I made later in that thread. WM pools the oil and gas and shares out the toxic shite.
A map showing both would be a good idea.. maybe @zarkwan could help?
5364 2018-01-31 14:32:27 Flu shots, like a lot of medical, is just about the money. Kind of like oil changes at the dealer, every 3000 miles. Modern medical is way over rated.

5434 2018-01-31 14:26:09 No shit!  More important, we need the young to vote.  If they want to save their future from climate chaos they better step up and vote out these old white oil funded candidates.  Kennedy is a perfect selection for them.
5435 2018-01-31 14:25:51 Now that ISIS has been defeated on the battlefield, any word yet when President Trump plans to seize the oil in the area, as promised in the campaign?
5436 2018-01-31 14:25:49 #TRUMP: "We have ended the war on American energy"
#FACT: One of Trump's consequential actions as president on this front was to approve the Keystone XL pipeline - a source of #FOREIGN oil, from Canada.

Well either my shitty drawings are being noticed or this was random coincidence, I'm inclined to believe the latter-

Still, pretty cool.

5441 2018-01-31 14:25:11 I wish you would go back to the window sticker with miles and Date. I should be changing every 3 months but can’t remember date and default to miles. It takes me forever to drive 3000 miles so I get fewer oil changes (& you less Business) simply because you changed this sticker!

5447 2018-01-31 14:24:08 Note on MLP's that I've been posting about for weeks..."record results of $EPD can be taken as an indication that most midstream oil & gas MLPs are currently seeing strong earnings growth, could send this sector much higher as other Midstream MLPs start reporting their earnings."
5448 2018-01-31 14:24:07 We should definitely trust the 2018 forecasts of an entity that had wildly incorrect forecasts for the price of oil in 2017 and the demand growth in 2017.
5449 2018-01-31 14:24:04 Chastity is the way bro . The oil no go spoil .
5450 2018-01-31 14:24:03 Lord help us, you can sell snake oil to anyone. I give Trump less than 48hrs and he’ll be back to name calling. You can Take that to the Bank.
5451 2018-01-31 14:23:21 Yes she says there's no infection even tho it's really sore and to use warm olive oil as it's blocked with wax surely 3 days in I should be seeing some improvement Xx
5452 2018-01-31 14:23:18 My wife drives the Lexus IS250, it is small and has a surprisingly weak V6.  We like it but needed a bigger car, so I have the C300.  Annual no-charge maintenance/oil/tires, I had one stuck valve that needed a warranty repair, otherwise it’s been fine, though 2 years old.
5453 2018-01-31 14:23:14 Mr. Khan I am waiting to see tweets from you on Economy, Trade Deficit, Debt, IMF, Consumer-driven growth, SBP role. Please, Pakistan faces a crisis. Oil prices are going up & Debt pressure increasing.

5488 2018-01-31 14:19:35 The thing that matters is whether exploiting an oilfield is actually worth doing so - not the mere existence of one. Oil is not bring in tax revenues currently. That is what counts.
5489 2018-01-31 14:19:34 The place I got my oil change at literally put in the wrong oil AND didn't put the cap back on right which caused my car to light up saying to turn it off immediately...INSTANT PANIC ATTACK

5495 2018-01-31 14:18:51 The Dems are sore losers and no matter what the President does they want him out. OBama was a “snake oil salesman” who missed his comedic calling and sold them a bill of goods and twice they voted for him. He practically destroyed this Country but the Left is still oblivious.
5496 2018-01-31 14:18:39 I’m curious about a couple things. Please forgive my ignorance. 1. Are oil & gas still exempt from clean air & water act? 2. Is the EPA going to create regs or Industry taxes that make make them pay for their own superfund clean up sites instead of tax payers?
5497 2018-01-31 14:18:36 Big #oil companies are resuming ambitious offshore projects, but this time they are keeping spending in check, as investors urge them to avoid a repeat of their overspending in the last #oil rally.
5498 2018-01-31 14:18:34 I had a dream last night I won a trip to Disney and I drove there on a moped that runs on olive oil.... by myself bc none of my friends wanted to go..... what
5499 2018-01-31 14:18:33 My car has actually been doing good for this past week but now it wants to hit me with “oil low turn off engine immediately” alert.
5500 2018-01-31 14:18:32 Both masks are amazing for that! The moon mask is good for the dry spots and the green one is great for combo. Also the super bounce serum is good for hydration on dry spots. I recommend the cleanser to everyone bc it's good for all skin types! Also a big fan of body wash/ oil
5501 2018-01-31 14:18:28 North African sweet crude is so much cleaner than heavy filthy VZ oil.  Much easier to refine also.
5502 2018-01-31 14:18:26 As we have seen with other forms of energy colonialism (like coal mining or oil extraction), the people closest to the affected areas don’t get the money out of this stuff. They just pay a lot of the externalized costs.
5503 2018-01-31 14:18:16 So I have this juice called that is unsweetened orange juice, lemon juice, cayenne pepper and oil or oregano...let me get near a bathroom and camp out.
5504 2018-01-31 14:18:13 I use to use coconut oil on my hair but it started to make my hair feel heavy so I switch to grape seed or avocado oil.

5510 2018-01-31 14:17:46 Thanks for the reply, but I was asking if it is ok to use the essential oils in an electric aromatherapy diffuser which requires 100% pure essential oil? The eucalyptus essential oil in particular contains caprylic/capric triglyceride.

5580 2018-01-31 14:12:07 The question is if '' abandonex'' clauses are included in oil contracts that are drawn in nigeria? Like someone noted, we are too smart not to know this, but someone somewhere has been feeding fat to the detriment of the communities in oil producing regions.

5777 2018-01-31 13:54:47 i know recently it went up around the snow storms thats when its harder to get the oil so the companies raise gas prices to keep same profit ... like when sandy happened thats when it was like $6 a gallon.. i doubt its always the reason tho

5795 2018-01-31 13:52:58 Coconut oil is great for hair. Olive oil is good but I find castor oil to be the most effective. Leave it in, soak it well, then shampoo twice to rinse it out. No conditioner needed.
5796 2018-01-31 13:52:51 BC isn’t landlocked, thus we can get the refined oil from someone (although a premium would have to be paid if not from the US.  Again another argument to extend our refinining capacity).
Not sure landlocked Alberta can afford to start a trade war with us, they have more to lose.

5845 2018-01-31 13:47:21 JJ Organics were selling Organic castor oil w/ aloe vera extracts, coconut oil, and vitamin E essentials.

5848 2018-01-31 13:46:58 People just need to do their own research. My sister uses essential oil and she makes sure that her dog isn’t in her room at night when diffusing. Also, if you put essential oils on animals, let them choose the oil because they will go to the ones that they like/aren’t toxic.
5849 2018-01-31 13:46:43 Soon AB will retaliate against BC’s trade war. What will happen when AB shuts off Oil to the Lower Mainland?   When AB separates and joins the , BC can buy its oil in USD.
5850 2018-01-31 13:46:13 Most libs can decipher truth from BS, sadly trumpers not so much. Still buying the snake oil. 
5851 2018-01-31 13:46:11 I was ready to shave my head this morning. I washed it last night because it looked like someone had submerged me headfirst into a tankard of olive oil. And when I woke up this morning, it still looked that way.

5864 2018-01-31 13:44:16 That’s because of US and private embargos and flaws within the venezuelan economic planning that relied too much on oil and suffered when prices crashed, plus true socialism is classless there are no rich or poor wealth is divided equally among the working class that produced it
5865 2018-01-31 13:44:10 Yeah, HIS trade plan. Isn't that part of his goal - make sustainable energy so expensive/unattainable that the U.S. must rely on coal & oil?

5939 2018-01-31 13:34:51 Shale oil is not WTI grade.  Oil is not homogeneous.  Excess of one gr does not 1:1 degrade the pricing of entire global crude complex. People missing facts about oil, focusing on prod only.  Copper and gold are metals, glut in one doesn't 1:1 impact the price of the other. #OOTT
5940 2018-01-31 13:34:34 My simple theory on why the #MediterraneanDiet is so good for you is that it keeps you well oiled. What with the ex virgin Olive oil, greens ,fruits and a touch of red wine #Pioppidiet Its the difference between being like a Ferrari to a rusty old banger
5941 2018-01-31 13:34:22 Scotland should simply add the figure Norway gets for oil each year & pro rata amend it up or down dependent on volumes produced. If 20% more then Scot would get 20% more than Norway with same tax regime. GERS plus real oil value if indy should be a known figure and unquestioned.

5957 2018-01-31 13:32:54 Coconut oil is a great moisturiser! Tbh though to anyone reading this, if youre getting dandruff that bad you actually DO need medication better than head and shoulders. Normal dandruff is tiny like ash but bad dandruff is huge pastry flakes of oily gross.
5958 2018-01-31 13:32:50 To the extent that TMX diverts oil that would otherwise have gone to IL (albeit AB-originated oil), thereby reducing the oversupply, the price discount will decrease for other oil going to that market.

6050 2018-01-31 13:23:35 I saw that this cooking really likes using duck oil for cooking.  Never tried it.  I do recommend using coconut oil.  It's very shelf life stable, if the temp is lower than 75F it is solid.  Also can be used for more than cooking.  Great flavor too.

6128 2018-01-31 13:14:49 Well sure...  It should (and I stress "should") provide a foundation on which to build a bigger/broader/higher value economy.  Remember tho the UK Govt has no meaningful stake in oil/gas. It's invested sod all unlike Norway.

6141 2018-01-31 13:14:02 So now you got all your stuff you're ready to shave. Do it *after* a hot shower. After you get out (or even if you're in the shower, but logistically it's a little harder), wet your face again with the hottest water you can. That'll open up your pores. Then apply the oil.

6153 2018-01-31 13:13:08 Got it. But I would argue that shale-players hedging logic slightly different. Vast majority of their oil is locally dispatched via pipes, only a tiny % exported. Hedging much more tied to balancesheet risk management/ROE enhancement IMO. Thanks for your thoughts.

6163 2018-01-31 13:12:39 The fact that we are going to run out of oil before the end of this century should really be alarming

6177 2018-01-31 13:11:14 He promised that whatever police do, "it will be safe ... but it will be effective." He says climbing poles on Sunday "will be far more difficult" than when police used a vegetable oil product, which weather can affect.

6266 2018-01-31 12:59:49 I would suggest just using castor oil for your lashes as you can also use it on your brows and in your hair. It’s a really thick oil though so it can take some getting used to but I’ve been using it for years and it’s a lifesaver!

6288 2018-01-31 12:57:35 pls moisturise your face even if it's the oily type. The reason ur face is oily is bcs it's not moisturise enough so in return in produce more oil.

6382 2018-01-31 12:45:46 Just a bunch of words written by someone else, thrown in front of him and told to READ! No comprehension of what he actually was reading. Just more BS. Just a typical snake oil salesman. This has to end soon right?
6383 2018-01-31 12:45:33 Something like that. New low score though: car needs an oil change and is 32 miles away from an empty gas tank 
6384 2018-01-31 12:45:32 Soldiers follow orders. Moral choices and the direction they march in is determined by politicians and special interest groups, like, just as a completely wild example, the oil and gas sector. 

If Scotland's links to the union is an onion then military is the very core.
6385 2018-01-31 12:45:25 @AudiUK TTS MK2 differential oil - manual says it's 'lifetime'. How long is lifetime? 10 years? 200k miles? If the vehicle has an ultra long life, when should it be changed?

The most cruel spending in India is OIL companies spending on advertising...oil is an essential good and normally customers don't insist on any brand....who will listen to a feeble voice!

6418 2018-01-31 12:42:28 You didn't. But there's a pretty solid chance you think it's not true. And I'm pointing at the irony of thinking that Planned Parenthood is some nefarious money-making scheme while ignoring the huge influx of cash from the oil industry.

You're probably doing your best, though.

6456 2018-01-31 12:37:20 It's January and #gas has risen .15 cents in a week. You would think #BigOil companies made enough profit a decade ago to last a lifetime. I've never understood why the price of gas is directly dependent on how much a barrel of oil is. #ripoff
6457 2018-01-31 12:37:19 True to a point. To the extent that TMX reduces the differential between oil from AB (eg, WCS) and WTI, SK would also benefit from the general increase in prices realized.

6462 2018-01-31 12:36:35 Janet oil and gas are two different things... Our gas reserves are at capacity and have been since the fracking boom...I suggest you educate yourself on the subject before calling out someone who is.

6545 2018-01-31 12:26:36 BJP carried out tremendous opposition to rise in oil prices. You're party hasn't done anything even as prices reach sky high.

6547 2018-01-31 12:26:09 For a player to actually reject you whilst your 12 pts clear and possibly on for a quad, the best team you have even had in your shit history is quite clearly embarrassing and even more embarrassing to put it down to wages as an oil rich club.

6550 2018-01-31 12:25:57 In the 80's the redoubtable G.Foulkes MP was hammering on about the oil and gas finds off the Ayrshire coast and demanding the fields be developed. After a whiff of ermine he lost his voice. He has since recovered and can be seen gently snoozing in the H.O.L. of an afternoon.

6552 2018-01-31 12:25:51 @CNN Obama got some off-handed economic gains from the oil glut. When gas prices drop, money saved @ the pump goes straight into the economy. Trump will feel a drag as we ship our surplus off shore 2 appease rich buds.
6553 2018-01-31 12:25:34 CBD Oil is awesome and is so helpful but the fact that I legit almost puke every time I take it is really rough. It's like drinking funky tasting olive oil straight out of the bottle.

6566 2018-01-31 12:24:10 I almost used my mineral oil as mouthwash. I need to wake up.
6567 2018-01-31 12:23:49 I was aware of the large field West of Shetland before 2014, so we're most in the oil industry.

6581 2018-01-31 12:21:42 It's not a very good one but there is an argument to let them have a population % share of the oil, and stop all the fannying around with defence.
6582 2018-01-31 12:21:38 Facts: trump is Russia supporting, he is targeting brown immigrants which makes him racist and if you vote for it you’re racist too, military/LEO strength = push for police state, oil/coal over solar and renewable = climate change problems

6584 2018-01-31 12:21:32 You’re assuming oil is only used for fuels , remember over 6000 household items are made using oil , you won’t get that from renewables
6585 2018-01-31 12:21:22 Lönsam produktionstillväxt
Tethys Oil har på fem år ökat produktionen från noll till 12.000 fat per dag genom en verksamhet med ovanligt låga kostnader. Verksamhet inom prospektering innebär ytterligare potential.

6617 2018-01-31 12:15:01 1 - Morgane, you don't even know the "workplace" of oil & gas nor of sawmills. Have you been in these "workplaces"? AND not only for a tour? So you can't invoke those "workplaces" & their "safety policies" to confound their "industry policies" with your very personal beliefs.
6618 2018-01-31 12:15:00 Because it “won’t help” (claim without proof), we need to keep it illegal - making those desperate to try subject to criminal penalties in their final moments?
Are you going to enforce those prohibitions? Barge into hospice care, pointing guns at old people with snake oil?

6626 2018-01-31 12:13:53 But not this time. I noticed the change a few days ago and concluded brexit outlook  must be REALLY bad to change a narrative so long established: ie when price rising oil is running out: when it is falling Scotland will starve with indy. Buzzfeed leak seems to confirm
6627 2018-01-31 12:13:52 Unbelievable UK must be up against the buffers to release this information about Scottish Oil #Normally keep this sort of news well hidden so proceeds can be directed goodness knows where!!

6645 2018-01-31 12:10:45 Oh for fuck’s sake. That is palm oil. The article about the flight mentions a crop (NOT palm oil) and a company. Their website tell you where they operate. It doesn’t give all the answers, but gives some. Come on, life is too short for buffoonery

6678 2018-01-31 12:06:46 It is not only #climatechange that mandates getting away from oil + coal and develop sustainable energy sources, it is also the nightmares that the governing demons of #USA impose on the world about controlling the oil market + Middle East.

6680 2018-01-31 12:06:38 CO2 emission reduction and technical research are not mutually exclusive, our offshore wind auction prices are cheaper than new wind auction prices per kWh! This murderers big oil and coal’s future to only raw chemical supply!

6682 2018-01-31 12:06:23 Except most of that oil is being exported to foreign countries anyway. You'll just be screwing your own economy that is based solely on oil meanwhile BC starts buying more gas from its biggest trading partner the USA and gas prices soon go back to normal

6685 2018-01-31 12:06:07 If it wasn’t for oil they would stil be living in the 7th century, and when their oil runs out they will go right back. Because they have done absolutely nothing for advancement with their money.

6824 2018-01-31 11:46:21 Counter arguments:  1) with widespread right to try clinical trials will slow substantially thereby removing our ability to determine the 90% of drugs that don't work. 2) who pays? 3) companies will spring up quickly to exploit the ability to sell snake oil.

6829 2018-01-31 11:45:16 This isn't just an issue of an oil pipeline it's an issue that could finally lead to BC becoming an independent nation.

6904 2018-01-31 11:31:29 Just raw coconut oil did absolute wonders for my skin! I put it on like 3 times a day at first on dry skin and then once they’d gone down a bit I just did it a couple of times a week in the shower! But it took the redness out of them straight away!
6905 2018-01-31 11:30:56 tea tree oil helped get rid of the redness around mine and then helped them not look as obvious x

Thank you, @BarackObama for ending the forty year ban on American oil exports

7289 2018-01-31 10:23:23 Because you don’t give two fucks about the environment. It’s all about the money and sucking each other off, Because you are too greedy. Btw, I hear tide pods pair great with crude oil. Why don’t you have a “dinner party” and enjoy some?

7315 2018-01-31 10:18:51 Oh I agree the N. Sea will continue to provide jobs but in terms of Thatcher funding the dole queues directly with oil taxes that is not going to happen again. The Brexit black hole will not be filled with oil revenue.
7316 2018-01-31 10:18:33 Please can we have a plan to close all UK oil and gas wells by 2030? If you like, by all means convert some to produce geothermal electricity.
7317 2018-01-31 10:18:31 Well don’t let animals drink oil
7318 2018-01-31 10:18:31 Maybe it wasn't the oil, maybe it was how spicy it was. Spicy things = fire, right?
7319 2018-01-31 10:17:56 Hemp seed oil is a bomb ass alternative for coconut oil, and it doesn't clog pores. It's great for acne prone skin. I get it on Amazon for like $10 for 8oz and I mix it with 100% tea tree oil

1. Oil Spill cases should be put in a fast track category in court.

2. NOSDRA should be given the power of an arbitrator between oil companies and communities on cases of spill. #StrengtheningNOSDRA
7325 2018-01-31 10:16:55 I thought we had no oil left?
7326 2018-01-31 10:16:52 Palm oil is not ethical, it deforests tropical rainforests, endangering tigers, Sun bears, Bornean elephants, Rhinos & Bornean orangutan. To save endangered species it should be banned all together, not just in the EU @BBCEarth @AnimalPlanet @savetherhino 
7327 2018-01-31 10:16:51 Furthermore, UK did bombard Iraq to oblivion in the name of “democracy”. The soon as Kurds practiced this democracy and did a referendum for independence several months ago, UK was the first to officially say it won’t recognise it. It is all about the free Oil.
7328 2018-01-31 10:16:47 Euro zone inflation estimated to have fallen to 1.3% in January, core inflation up to 1.2%. 

Inflation pressures remain benign, despite the economic boom and jump in oil prices. Euro at a 3-year high complicates ECB's attempts to get inflation up towards target.

7330 2018-01-31 10:16:41 Every market is a gamble, & everything with any intrinsic value is only worth what we pay for it. Gold, Oil, FIAT is only worth what we pay for it, so what is the difference? None! Major countries are looking into blockchain centralized currency, like $XRP  sign of the future.

7347 2018-01-31 10:14:18 Then that's good survey you did and Maize farming is also one of the good farming crops in the three Northern regions.
There are so many natural resources there to explore if the gov't turn to it.
groundnut farming could save the nation through exporting it raw and the oil in it.

7351 2018-01-31 10:14:07 You are right I do live in the UK and I am British as you are. That being said it was the UK that divided Kurdistan as it was one of it’s colonies and realised it had oil. To ensure trouble in the region forever, it made it a disputed land so the Free oil comes in.

7358 2018-01-31 10:13:22 Assad buying ISIS oil counts as support. And Hezbollah negotiated for a convoy to escape coordinates with ISIS. Oddly this shows PKK not attacking ISIS. It's FSA & civilians who are primary target for nearly all factions, not ISIS.

7384 2018-01-31 10:08:39 What did you do to stop the disintegration of the lands the refugees came from? Your tanks were lined up in a row looking into Syria doing nothing while ISIS set up shop. You bought their oil and allowed them safe passage through Turkey. You are a major part of the problem.
7385 2018-01-31 10:07:54 I just had this amazing chocolate cake from a mix. But you put in butter and not oil. Maybe that's why it is so amazing.
7386 2018-01-31 10:07:46 which is great but there is not a scintila of proff that butter and coconut oil cause CVD.
You made a copuple of assertions but have failed to present conclusive proof that supports your case.

I'm happy for you to believe what you want to believe but you dont have proof.
7387 2018-01-31 10:07:24 One wee look from him would tell him over 6000 household items are produced from oil . That market will never go away .

7389 2018-01-31 10:07:15 It's running oot mate. It's not real oil, like in Saudi and that.
7390 2018-01-31 10:07:10 Except it wont. The Saudis know that renewables have put an absolute cap on the price of oil and its falling all the time. Whilst N. Sea production will continue the amount of tax the govt. can extract will seriously diminish.
7391 2018-01-31 10:06:49 Woah. That’s a lot of oil. #RHOMelbourne
7392 2018-01-31 10:06:46 Oil. Unlike your credibility, it hasn't run out.
7393 2018-01-31 10:06:45 Thank you very much for reporting it, I have informed Highways. Ref.: 1621676
7394 2018-01-31 10:06:44 Can’t wait for the headline, “BP expects oil production to double, unless there’s an independence referendum, then it won’t”
7395 2018-01-31 10:06:34 Strange how all this oil is now suddenly being 'discovered '!! Or did they always know that it was there but didn't say anything for political reasons.Whurs Sir Ian Wood??
7396 2018-01-31 10:06:27 Det vidste de godt og i særdeleshed APM, som skulle bruge skatterabatten for at maksimere salgsprisen på Maersk Oil. APM spiller Folketinget som en violin og klapper og tramper hele vejen op i deres nye corporate jet.
7397 2018-01-31 10:06:24 no change today, their changes are communicated via the oil market reports
7398 2018-01-31 10:06:10 Fine if the basil was torn and the melon kept firm and not juiced. Maybe with some crumbled feta, black pepper and a little olive oil.

7402 2018-01-31 10:05:32 They've been shopping this deal to oil traders (for 100% offtake) for a hot minute. <$50 oil didn't help at the time as hedging costs were expensive.

7974 2018-01-31 08:23:20 Hi THC/CBD/RSO Cannabis Oil thanks for the follow! Keep your positive vibes and together there is much we can accomplish :-)
7975 2018-01-31 08:22:59 Before frying, sprinkle a little salt in your pan which will help keep the oil from splattering.
7976 2018-01-31 08:22:37 However you will do whatever it takes to fail others. Especially innocent civillians if there is oil in their land. Actions for this: training terrorists and pay them sallary. Arm them with whatever they need. Help them build strategic fortresses. Help them escape warzone...

7982 2018-01-31 08:21:37 Who out the oil in.? And was it the right oil..???. Can’t just chuck any oil in. Oil filters will also need changing as they probly clogged up if you’ve not serviced it. Might wanna check tyres aswell if you haven’t yet. Best thing, phone fiat for a bit of advice on what to do.x

7990 2018-01-31 08:20:34 Rosehip seed oil for sure!!! Works wonders for dry skin, is high in linoleic fatty acids to actually help reduce sebum production and potentially help with breakouts
7991 2018-01-31 08:20:33 I know you all aren't fond of this at all, but I am well armed both spiritually and mechanically. My favorite is my .380. Once I find the holy water and anointed oil, that will be by my bedside as well 
7992 2018-01-31 08:20:30 Refrigerate Puris: Keeping puris in the fridge for sometime (approximately 10-15 minutes) before frying will ensure they bloat up when put in hot oil without consuming too much grease.

8112 2018-01-31 07:58:47 BC...and saying this as someone who wants to combat climate change and hates pollution, pipelines are the way to go. Oil companies run the show. And it ain’t going anywhere. It’s the safest way to transport.
8113 2018-01-31 07:58:15 @benarsen1886 recently we gave @exxonmobil  80% of an oil field here in Ghana. The way we make deals erh, I don't know whether it's a problem of mental slavery or shallow thinking. #CitiCBS

8116 2018-01-31 07:58:07 El tema con los combustibles es la carga fiscal, si el gas oil cuesta 20 pesos 8 son impuestos es una barbaridad lo mismo con las tarifas pagas 45% por los impuestos, ahora lo que quiero sabes es cuál es el valor real del kw acá en gran buenos aires sin subsidios.?
8117 2018-01-31 07:58:06 Too bad so sad. Majority of BC Voted to stop the pipelines. Start diversifying Alberta so it's not so one trick pony dependent on oil boom and bust

8121 2018-01-31 07:56:43 There was an effort from within the oil industrys Conservative Party voting types, to lie their faces off when they knew a Yes vote would see Scotland inherit a vast amount of wealth from the North Sea. They just hate the idea of Scotland succeeding on its own.

8131 2018-01-31 07:53:42 Propping up coal is likely a losing proposition. But era of fossil fuels is hardly “over”. Look at current global energy mix and projections forward. Coal, oil and especially gas will be with us for a long time to come, irrespective of political pronouncements.

8250 2018-01-31 07:29:22 Of course England has committed regicide twice. Charles 1 and Harold who had been crowned and anointed with oil before his death and mutilation at Hastings. Then came genocide - the harrying of the North.

8280 2018-01-31 07:22:13 No.

Shell D'Arcy spent their private cash to find oil in the South. 

Remember Nigeria was not a Republic back then....Lagos State for instance retained Excise duties on imports via Lagos Ports

8282 2018-01-31 07:21:59 Ohh no its impossible what a curse more than doubling production in oil n gas. You said it was running out.
8283 2018-01-31 07:21:44 It may also be worth explaining that North Sea oil and gas at its best accounts for less than 10% of the Scottish economy.

8287 2018-01-31 07:21:24 Pharma industry puts twice as much $ towards lobbyists as oil+gas industries and 4x as much as military+aerospace industries. There are twice as many pharma lobbyists in D.C. than there are Congress members.

8289 2018-01-31 07:21:19 the only one i have right now is tea tree oil that i got for spot treatment. but grapeseed oil and rosehip seed oil are probably the most inexpensive ones and both work well for hyperpigmentation!
8290 2018-01-31 07:21:11 The PIG bill seeks to introduce reforms that would engender transparency, while at the same time making the oil and gas sector more business-oriented and profit-drive but it took 17 years after the first bill was passed

8430 2018-01-31 06:54:00 The Canadian Government says fruits and vegetables can be sold as "fresh" as much as a year after being harvested. It says aspartame is a natural sweetener. It says Bitumen is oil.  Bitumen wouldn't need to be mixed with diluent (Dilbit) to go in a pipeline if it was oil.

8546 2018-01-31 06:34:45 Remember, Carter Page is in the Steele dossier brokering the Rosneft oil deal of which 19% of the 500 Billion company was to go to Trump to kill the Russian sanctions once in office.

Which Trump did, apparently yesterday for good.  Whose to stop them?
8547 2018-01-31 06:34:43 Great! We use to do a similar work with data metaphors (oil, gold, diamond or wheat): as an ice breaker, we ask our attendees to choose one and explain. We think that oil, gold and diamond are not so wrong but an archaic vision.

8569 2018-01-31 06:30:44 India has reached 20 GW of solar power capacity. In CY 17  9.6 GW solar capacity was added or 45 % of power capacity addition in CY 17. 
Can we achieve 100 GW by 2022 ? Can it impact oil prices ? 
Will there be motivated campaign against solar power?
8570 2018-01-31 06:30:44 Well, sort of. All the oil profits belong to us (the people) but we try to be frugal and not spend too much (at least that was the plan, until the oil prices dropped in 2016).

8572 2018-01-31 06:30:12 Watching the DVR of trump sotus with my kid for extra points (hers) - and I think the president just claimed the church is the center of our country. If this guy actually believed in God that would be troubling. His use of god to sell his snake oil is disgusting.

8589 2018-01-31 06:26:13 You said if Heavy oils can be transported, which they currently are.  Increase in volume will be handled by a new pipeline.   The tanker traffic is after it's been through the refinery so not a heavy oil product in there.

My 2 cents: remind people to eat the fresh, fertile seeds they don't plant, juice the leaves (dilute with carrot juice, etc.) and make and use holy anointing oil from the Bible recipe.

8656 2018-01-31 06:11:30 Suspended particulate matter is very common in B.C.’s coastal waters, meaning that any dilbit spill will likely lead to submerged oil. Currently we have no ability to clean up oil that sinks below the surface, making dilbit a particularly risky substance to transport.

8667 2018-01-31 06:08:18 Bitumen is the raw product extracted from the Alberta oil sands. It is thicker and heavier than crude oil and must be diluted with chemicals in order for it to flow through pipelines. This combination of bitumen and diluent is referred to as diluted bitumen, or dilbit.

8699 2018-01-31 06:02:26 KM currently transports 300,000 barrels of oil each day, the new parallel pipeline would transport up to 890,000 barrels of oil, tripling current capacity. The increase in oil would lead to an increase in tanker traffic along the BC coast from 5 tankers per month to 34.

8708 2018-01-31 06:01:11 The original pipeline was constructed in 1953 and purchased by Kinder Morgan Canada in 2005. It was designed to carry conventional crude oil but recently has been carrying the heavy oil, diluted bitumen (dilbit), from the Alberta tar sands to tankers in Vancouver harbour.

8713 2018-01-31 05:59:43 the sound of bread and oil sizzling in a hot pan is just 
so top notch
8714 2018-01-31 05:59:39 Perhaps if we were not subsiding Scotland we might have more money. You going to start going on about the oil? If Scotland is so great why do we have loads of Scots down here working? Is it because this is where the money is?
8715 2018-01-31 05:59:35 I'd gladly drop ALL these synthetic concoctions, if that oil (without that mindless stupor feeling) would do the trick!
8716 2018-01-31 05:59:34 As global environmental stewards, Canadians must be cognizant of who we sell our oil products to, and what they will use it for that will either benefit or harm the global environment.If we don’t, then keep it in the ground!

8721 2018-01-31 05:58:02 Many people forget its raw bitumen and not refined oil that we are having transported to BC.  Very big difference and we need science  to weigh in on his safe or unsafe raw bitumen is to ship.
(Perhaps major concession to BC should be to refine the oil before transporting.)
8722 2018-01-31 05:57:55 Nigga cook it on medium and stop using  oil. All you need is butter.
8723 2018-01-31 05:57:49 Man I don't even remember if I put oil in the car I was working on today

8758 2018-01-31 05:51:48 I always want rub downs with oil tho
8759 2018-01-31 05:51:48 People really out here hating on coconut oil now. Idk what it did to y’all, but my skin still loves it. 
8760 2018-01-31 05:51:38 Well I believe in supply and demand, so $100 is less than 2 years away. Demand is nearing 100,000,000 bbls/ day and supply is once again declining and unable to keep up. The world’s appetite for oil is insatiable.
8761 2018-01-31 05:51:34 I switched a few years ago to oil cleansing and using an oil balm at night. I realized any soap product on my skin makes it crack. #dryandsensitiveskin
8762 2018-01-31 05:51:26 i use a retinol oil (along with a few other products/steps) and it made my skin nice as fuck. i love my skincare regime. taking the time every night before bed to my routine has made me more comfortable in my own skin

8785 2018-01-31 05:47:43 Depends on what's being researched, right? More efficient agricultural practices can lessen the environmental impact of feeding large populations. On the other hand, a new application of crude oil products, if it increases demand, could be disastrous (ex. plastics)
8786 2018-01-31 05:47:14 Like you wingnuts, the old NEB was simply a rubber stamp for oil companies and our alt right destructionists.

8829 2018-01-31 05:41:36 From what I recall, clean with a deruster if there’s rust on it with a softer scrub brush, wash it again, dry it in the oven
I don’t recall how to properly reseason them but once you do rub some oil on it once in a while to keep it good for longer
8830 2018-01-31 05:41:20 By your logic we should only ship lumber, grain, and other products via the cheapest route.

8843 2018-01-31 05:38:50 Russia is a failed state near collapse. Its economy is almost completely based on oil, leaving it unprepared for the 21st Century. For years, Putin’s been trying to tame the budget with austerity measures. We’re a hysterical people.

8916 2018-01-31 05:29:13 then take some thawed phyllo sheets, melt some vegan butter and oil together, lay a sheet of dough down and butter it. do like 5-6 layers. then add the “meat” mix. then some more dough layers. go hard on the butter especially on top. try to get the filling tucked in.

8941 2018-01-31 05:26:01 I use sqaulane oil at night and during the day under my spf moisturizer. It really locks in moisture. Castor oil is great for eyelashes and eyebrows. I'm all about the oils.

8951 2018-01-31 05:24:47 Who cares.  Obama went around apologizing and pretending we owe the world some penance.  GTFO.  Trump is setting the record straight.  When we do well the world does well.  Trump believes in oil independence, making things in America again and doing all he can to do that..MAGA!!!
8952 2018-01-31 05:24:35 I’m glad to see you changed your tie and combed your hair, great response speech! Go easy on the lip balm/coconut oil though, a little dripped down the corner of your mouth and caused some glare.

8958 2018-01-31 05:23:39 Think about all the jobs that are created, by producing our own oil. Also, we are less dependent on other countries for our demand.
8959 2018-01-31 05:23:39 Jojoba is the closest to skin's natural sebum but I personally love rosehip oil. 

Also they're expensive but have you tried any of the Sunday Riley oils?

8975 2018-01-31 05:21:24 I’ve been using the kate somerville dilo oil for a few months now, it’s expensive but it hydrated my skin soooo much

9078 2018-01-31 05:05:28 I read about essential oils and animal safety and some are toxic but from my knowledge it's if the animal gets skin to skin contact with the oil. Frightening though 
9079 2018-01-31 05:05:05 He just scarfed down a Hoagie with salad oil?
9080 2018-01-31 05:05:03 Yeah I stopped going to Sprouts cause that’s on the rich ppl’s side of my town lmao I go to Kroger and buy that off brand $7 jar of vegan virgin coconut oil and I use it everywhere but my face except for taking my makeup off. For face you gotta use that Sonia K stuff at Target.
9081 2018-01-31 05:04:54 For corporations who don't need tax cuts. And for middle class who also don't need tax cuts. Poor people, large families: people who actually need tax cuts, aren't benefiting. And the tax cuts open up Arctic Wilderness for oil drilling. Fuck anyone who thinks this is good.
9082 2018-01-31 05:04:53 You fry in oil that is really bad for your customers hearts !! Creamy oil (hydrogenated oil) is sooo bad!! Let me guide you to a better oil ! Please!
9083 2018-01-31 05:04:53 "value is a phenomenon of capitalism"

it's a phenomenon of human nature. Humans have desires, those desires are ordered according to the severity of which they are felt. The ordering of these desires is what we call value, and it has existed as long as humans have.
9084 2018-01-31 05:04:48 Yes. Lavender oil is also  for spot treating pimples
9085 2018-01-31 05:04:42 Not in the name of ALLHA  
But in the name of oil and wealth. Or for politics. ..
9086 2018-01-31 05:04:30 I sure didn’t want George Bush daugthersin Iraq? That was no more for any reason but oil! How many crippled, killed? That is where ISIS came from! Isis is a idea, evil! Wouldn’t want children to pay for parents stupidity!
9087 2018-01-31 05:04:13 Get organic coconut oil,organic sugar, juice a lemon or two in a bowl. I recommend glad container or some sort. The acid from the lemon lightens dark spots. Sugar help exfoliate. Coconut oil leaves you moisturize.
9088 2018-01-31 05:03:57 coconut oil for your skin is a scam.
9089 2018-01-31 05:03:45 A snake oil salesman is good at public speaking and that is exactly what Trump is
9090 2018-01-31 05:03:37 I bought an oil cleanser + oil sleeping mask yesterday because they were on clearance for $3 each and holy shit. My skin is SO soft. My pillowcase is ruined though rip

9110 2018-01-31 05:00:27 I'll never take politicians talking about using less oil and going green serious until they stop flying in private jets every other day
9111 2018-01-31 05:00:24 I do not like Trump. If he shat me a golden egg he would claim it was the biggest, best, and most beautiful egg ever shat. I would initially look at it with great skepticism but would reserve judgement.

I view him as a braggart, snake oil salesman, and completely untrustworthy.
9112 2018-01-31 05:00:14 Yup high porosity. You might need to try a different method to seal in the moisture. Like the L.O.C method or L.C.O. Sealing is key so get a good oil.
9113 2018-01-31 05:00:13 It's official, my skin hates coconut oil
9114 2018-01-31 05:00:01 What’s wrong with coconut oil??

9119 2018-01-31 04:59:32 MSM ANTI-LABOR OUTBURSTS lately:  The States & Federal elections on the horizon have really had them burning the midnight oil at the secretive LNP/IPA survival meetings. Even they can see the end is near. The thought of a Labor National Integrity Commission is horrifying to them

9121 2018-01-31 04:59:09 Isn’t it sad to cook longanissa that’s just all meat and no fat. You’re supposed to cook it in its own oil!

9126 2018-01-31 04:58:45 I think we’ve completed our Portugal/Spain/Morocco itinerary. Had to cut a few things but we can’t do it all. We have an awesome 2 weeks planned. 5 cities. Wine/olive oil tour, kayak/snorkel tour, beaches, hiking in the Andalucian Mountains, and so much food.
9127 2018-01-31 04:58:33 “100%” is one of his verbal tics, like “believe me” and “I can tell you.” The same snake oil salesman he’s always been.
9128 2018-01-31 04:58:32 Perfect But that would ruin the plan #Putin has for the US to trap us into buying his oil and fighting his wars
9129 2018-01-31 04:58:26 So I was kind enough to sign for my moms new tires on my credit & when I hadn't got my oil changed & asked to borrow her car to go to Debbie's she said no bc her car is messed up... but she's out here driving to Houston like every two weeks

9168 2018-01-31 04:53:16 Coconut oil. Since I was a baby. No soap on face. Amma would rub in the cream from the vessel milk was boiled in. Occasionally, scrub with besan. Once I moved here I scrub with st. Ives apricot about once a week (basically when I notice it in the shower!)
9169 2018-01-31 04:53:12 K, I kinda feel like we're in a Twilight Zone episode here. Washington state is standing its ground while Canada debates - still - routing oil to the west coast.

9171 2018-01-31 04:52:55 Oil paint dries differently from watercolor and acrylic (which dry from water evaporation), the oil molecules in the paint join together with oxygen molecules and eventually they all attach to each other and become unified in one big knot of molecules.

9176 2018-01-31 04:52:47 The oil industry is just going to become a new holocaust where the poor operate oil wells as slave labor and after they become too weak are ground up and feed to the other poors.
9177 2018-01-31 04:52:42 "Another skillet, filled with enough oil to cook half the chicken, fried it on one side, flipped it, fried the second side."

9178 2018-01-31 04:52:37 Hypocrisy personified...I do hope Kenney shuts off the taps to your province. Taking the money from oil and gas with one hand and stabbing Alberta with the other.
9179 2018-01-31 04:52:20 James, consumption is rising whether we like it or not.  If BC doesn’t want the oil then they don’t deserve the products made from oil.  Alberta is taking all the risk making those products for BC.  But, we are a nation and for one province to hold up another is wrong.
9180 2018-01-31 04:52:12 Now I know! It’s his dad that makes $1 million per year and mom makes $500k per year working at a non profit giving Venezuela oil to the poor and helping an oppressive socialist regime at the same time. An consensual affair w a porn star? Child’s play compared to Camelot!!

9183 2018-01-31 04:51:59 I think CN is a good bet regardless. FRO is being hurt by there being a lot of Oil available from Fracking and there is still a very large surplus of Oil stored in the large tank farms. No need, right now, to use as many tankers.

9219 2018-01-31 04:46:29 Exxon investing 50 billion dollars

Again, over the course of five years, but accurate. This investment mostly focuses on West Texas and New Mexico oil field projects.

This is when all those other teams come back to reality and the oil kick it up a shit ton.
9230 2018-01-31 04:45:24 You don't need that, but you will probably need coal, oil or natural gas to power your electric plants that power your electric vehicles...
9231 2018-01-31 04:45:21 Guess a banker, an oil exec or a lobbyist were busy
9232 2018-01-31 04:44:48 My dogs use a tea tree oil extract shampoo and they’re fine. It’s all in moderation. Of course excessive exposure even to humans can be toxic.

9238 2018-01-31 04:44:25 Can we pour some of Marco Rubio’s water onto Chia Ginger Kennedy? Or have him change the oil in his muscle car while instructing the process in Espanol? #WhatILearnedToday #BlazeSotu @DocThompsonShow @realKrisCruz @JeffyMRA

9248 2018-01-31 04:43:16 Yes unless it is oil. When Venezuela will peg their crypto to oil then they will be mad. Even though it is their oil and their crypto and has nothing to do with us dollar. Almost time to kiss goodbye to Us dollar as global reserve.
9249 2018-01-31 04:43:14 A Kennedy in a school auto shop... wonder if he promised the crowd Free oil changes?

9254 2018-01-31 04:42:37 And there is plenty of more oil at sea. Supply is ample. The world is swimming in oil. Have a fun 2018 troll.
9255 2018-01-31 04:42:35 I’ve used this oil for YEARS! Now all of a sudden I’m allergic to it.
9256 2018-01-31 04:42:25 Wish I had some oil or an edible 
9257 2018-01-31 04:42:24 "I have to finish for now, I'm out of... oil"
9258 2018-01-31 04:42:13 Does it irq any lefty that you are buying oil from Trump, helping him make America great again? Money that would stay in Canada, provide jobs to Canadians?

9263 2018-01-31 04:41:43 I don't think Alberta wants to get into that scenario. Alberta already is exporting oil from BC.

9268 2018-01-31 04:40:54 The only parallel I have seen is a lot of Texas influence in Calgary and the oil patch. The prairies have much more in common with Montana and North Dakota than the deep south.
9269 2018-01-31 04:40:47 I got argan oil in my eye
9270 2018-01-31 04:40:43 I think you guys need to recheck your position on being able to export oil and natural gas.

9276 2018-01-31 04:40:12 That’s what I thought at first too (oil on oil sounds counterproductive right?!). But it works some magic! It makes your body produces less oil because it doesn’t have the harshness of soap, which can actually encourage oil production. I use it every night!
9277 2018-01-31 04:40:05 I was letting the oil and low pressure light shine for a few weeks.  But I took care of them today.  Dang.  I kinda miss them.
9278 2018-01-31 04:39:57 Coconut oil never broke my face out
9279 2018-01-31 04:39:37 @SenatorWong Which oil fields in the United Arab Emirates would Australia have to have protected from Iranian hostilities in July 2012?

9288 2018-01-31 04:38:31 I'm not sure what planet Markham Hislop comes from, but here on Earth, specifically in Canada, we do not roll out the military to do Big Oil's bidding.  If he likes living under that kind of regime I'm sure Putin would welcome him with open arms.
9289 2018-01-31 04:38:31 I'm currently trying to figure out how hard I really be slapping on this coconut oil on my skin when I get out the shower lol I looked on my wall and seen several spots with solid not liquid coconut oil on it 
9290 2018-01-31 04:38:14 Ya that's why we've got India showing up with full tankers of heavy oil to exchange for light oil.  You do not know what you're doin.

9293 2018-01-31 04:37:34 I’m a redhead, so I’m oddly sensitive to pain. I also require an oil drum of sunscreen to enjoy a summer day. I have both Irish curses.
9294 2018-01-31 04:37:31 I find it remarkable that other provinces slam oil and gas, but don't seem concerned about taking the funds these industries generate for our country. A bit hypocritical.#bcpoli
9295 2018-01-31 04:37:29 Now let’s stop the shipments of tar sands dilbit that CURRENTLY threaten our Salish Sea. Unescorted articulated tug barges filled with tar sands oil head from Burnaby to Tacoma WA about once per week.
9296 2018-01-31 04:37:17 Same as anyone who says “there’s an oil for that”

9310 2018-01-31 04:35:50 The American Dream does not remotely resemble what trump is trying to sell us on now. He is taking us back to some of the ugliest, worst times in the history of our country. No thanks I don't think I will purchase the snake oil he is selling.
9311 2018-01-31 04:35:48 I never use oil...butter....grease...nothing...
9312 2018-01-31 04:35:46 Trust in the collective . What if Gareth Hughes decided today that Oil drilling in his opinion was now good for the environment. and he would act in his capacity to fight in the house to that end ... Should he stay as a green list MP against the others?

They are for Big oil, Big Bankers, and Big corp.'s. I wish he would just support our vets on our borders. We have the technology.
9320 2018-01-31 04:34:37 We started for oil solely based on greed, not only that but we generalize an entire races as “terrorists” yet only the radicals are the ones causing the damage. You know who created ISIS right? Basically the U.S by supplying hem arms to rebel against an parliament that

9331 2018-01-31 04:33:15 To work with what we have we need to use taxes on natural gas and oil.  To use what we have we cannot get rid of equipment and inventory taxes.

9360 2018-01-31 04:30:38 Tea tree oil contains various types of chemicals called terpenes. These are the chemicals that make the oil effective against bacteria and fungi. They are also the toxic agent. Terpenes are rapidly absorbed into the body whether taken orally or on the skin. This means topical app

9362 2018-01-31 04:30:31 The blue-collar Trump voters know BS when they hear.  Trustng Dems with economy means: 1)You didn’t build it; 2)Those Jobs are gone and not coming back, and 3)You c/nt drill your way out of “oil shortage”.  Trump knows what Amer can do and gets gov out of the way so we can do it.
9363 2018-01-31 04:30:27 Koch industries will hire felons. They are putting money behind justice reform. You don't mention that.
9364 2018-01-31 04:30:21 Up in arms about @panerabread’s “clean chicken wing” sauce. Normally, I hate the “paleo police,” but when you are a big company, labeling your food as “clean” comes with responsibility. Don’t put freaking soybean oil and canola oil in your “clean” food.

9371 2018-01-31 04:29:23 It's probly hopeless to argue this w BK but oil-by-rail has lots of advantages over pipelining as well as downsides but both have merits and uses in existing mkts, eg existing rail in #bcpoli cld avoid building costly new energy-sucking pipeline and reduce % of diluent in bitumen
9372 2018-01-31 04:29:21 You use your wealth to buy tools that make people's labor more productive, then you make agreements with other people for the use of these tools in exchange for some of the excess of what they produce with them compared to what they otherwise would have. Tada capitalism.
9373 2018-01-31 04:29:16 Kiki started at the oil refinery today. I'm happy for my bitch!
9374 2018-01-31 04:29:13 Once again - tell us about the fuel oil your family sold to nazi Germany during WWII.

9382 2018-01-31 04:28:42 You aren’t listening to your constituents. Removing regulations isn’t a goal. Stripping the EPA of its authority, opening our entire coastline to oil and gas drilling, polluting our streams, reducing our National Parks, removing net neutrality; these aren’t in our interests.
9383 2018-01-31 04:28:39 Why did every children’s tv show portray brussels sprouts as the enemy? What kind of propaganda was that? Bc here in adulthood roasted sprouts drizzled w olive oil and a dash of salt/pepper is the only thing I’m living for day to day
9384 2018-01-31 04:28:32 So bloody true...billions of dollars to invade a country, fund the other side too , both buys shit loads of weapons and a whole pile of utter bullshit  is sold to the brainless.
Oooo look they have a huge pile of Oil and a  Bank we dont own but we do now..

9387 2018-01-31 04:28:09 Wait you mean you have 0% oil life. Or 0 oil in your engine? As in bone dry?
9388 2018-01-31 04:28:07 For dinner tonight I baked my chicken breasts in a coating of mustard,  italian dressing, pesto, a little extra parmesan, and salt and pepper.  9/10 will do again, and next time I'll surround the chicken with  potatoes or sweet potatoes to cook in the excess oil.

Dems care to much about the environment and the individual,  and not enough about business. For example  Bush 43 sold the country to big oil.
9394 2018-01-31 04:27:29 yep, no oil company on earth is so crazy to actually use Flood Geology to find resources (one start up who tried did a Trump Casino fast) ... all oil companies rely wisely on real geology
9395 2018-01-31 04:27:19 Face the truth. You and fellow libs have no intention of addressing it in any way except to amnesty every illegal in the country/ bring more

9398 2018-01-31 04:26:56 Meanwhile, coal companies and energy companies continue to make billions and pollute the air unchecked. More terminal illnesses and rising cost of gas and oil. Demand pushes up price so, increase in healthcare cost for terminal illness.
9399 2018-01-31 04:26:55 Not yet - their oil sands not yet developed, still in the ground.
9400 2018-01-31 04:26:49 You want to talk about oil at sea troll? That actually increased! Of all things, the narrative pushers were able to hide the fact that recent oil inventory decreases actually was just oil going to sea. Again, tell your programmer to better his/her programming skills.
9401 2018-01-31 04:26:37 Looks just like the guy who changed my oil at Jiffy Lube
9402 2018-01-31 04:26:37 It's the same call of hypocrisy the left has when a conservative accepts big oil money and then shames drilling or cheers for alternative energy.  I do applaud not compromising values, but to be up in arms about an aggressive military stance doesn't seem to add up...

9407 2018-01-31 04:25:56 It looks like your friend has some food you want, he says he will give it to you for some of your food. You agree to the trade, both give up what the other wants, and are both happier for it. You start trading with others in the same way and become wealthy.
9408 2018-01-31 04:25:49 But he won’t.  Go sell your snake oil BS somewhere else.  You excuse him all too frequently.
9409 2018-01-31 04:25:46 Hey Joe, ask ypur dad how his Venezuelan oil's doing.
9410 2018-01-31 04:25:43 Same.. that and hot oil treatments
9411 2018-01-31 04:25:32 Irony is that the Russians who got that ball rolling to begin with. Obama refused to bomb #Daesh oil productions, allowed Daesh to grow fat and bold, then Putin came to show how it should be done, & Dasehbags lost their cashcows...then things finally gone south for #Daeshbags.

9417 2018-01-31 04:25:00 Actually the falling dollar since Trump was elected caused commodities to climb, good for Trump/Putin regime OIL$$$, but that & more expensive imports are hurting consumers/real economy. Where's the cheaper, better healthcare he promised? The temporary tax cuts won't make a dent.

Answer: There is no money to be made off Global Warming!!!!
9423 2018-01-31 04:24:28 Had a really heated bar conversation tonight in Columbus w/someone who works in oil & gas about fracking. It was rough w/a lot of push back. At the end he volunteered that he would never recommend fracking on a property his family lived on. I think that sums it up

9453 2018-01-31 04:21:39 Just being honest, I used coconut oil ever so lightly on my face today (because it was all I had) knowing it would fuck me up and now my face is lowkey stinging and I’m ashamed to be doing this with y’all right now.  #MeTooDammit
9454 2018-01-31 04:21:27 After the shower I love putting coconut oil... bitchhh best feeling
9455 2018-01-31 04:21:16 definitely fluoride. and for those of us with easily-cavitied enamel, extra fluoride toothpaste from the dentist. and, weirdly, before-bed oil rinse for receding gums/gingivitis-few studies, but it's worked for so many of my older patients (and me) like moisturizer for your gums
9456 2018-01-31 04:21:07 Regardless, the thing was started for the same reason Gaddafi was taken out, with a dose of finishing what Bush 41 should have done. There were WMDs before there weren't, as evidenced by the genocide of Saddam's own people, just as in Libya. Don't be naive about the oil.

9459 2018-01-31 04:20:41 you are selling a lie. Energy east was killed politically. Quebec pays for Saudi oil with Alta equalization.
9460 2018-01-31 04:20:32 I bet he spells oil - M O N E Y.
9461 2018-01-31 04:20:03 No thanks. I've had enough infomercial, boner pill, big pharma propaganda, super loud volume blasting, big oil feel good bullshit to last me a lifetime. Most people I know mute and/or change the channel immediately. I'm not about to stop doing that.

9464 2018-01-31 04:19:49 I was going to make a snarky reply about your bs.   However,  Joe Kennedy just gave the Democratic response.  You should take notes.  But We The People have no interest in your snake oil words.

9466 2018-01-31 04:19:23 They use 2008, the nadar of economic collapse, as the baseline.  The MSM spin is mind boggling.  In 2008 shale oil came on line so there was a natural uptick there but never exploited.  Markets rose but rates were so low money was practically free
9467 2018-01-31 04:19:13 Wow mineral oil is my new best friend
9468 2018-01-31 04:19:10 Putin wants to flood the world with Russian oil. Disgracing Clinton, disparaging climate issues, getting America to fight itself erase safety / environmental protections trump is helping him for a legacy for his company.
9469 2018-01-31 04:19:04 “Sir , we found some other things that need to be replaced .   Your total is $298 “

Me: “ I just came in for an oil change you were promoting for $29.99 with the promotional trick poster dude on the corner “
9470 2018-01-31 04:19:04 Which is why it's a really bad idea to DOUBLE DOWN on oil, which is what building a pipeline is.

How are we supposed to combat climate change then? Do we just do nothing so that Alberta can keep making money on it?
9471 2018-01-31 04:19:03 Wood and his mates would pay far less tax in UK than in an indy Scot using a Norwegian tax model.  But the blatant lies about oil running out was never true and prices go up and down cyclically.

9476 2018-01-31 04:18:38 The only pipeline discussion is being originated in AB - by Notley.  BC, AB and Sask will all benefit getting oil to waterside. BC intervention unconstitutional, Sask is silent. #ableg
9477 2018-01-31 04:18:23 Surprised?  Not me!  Hopefully, he'll devise a way for his great- grandchildren to be able to eat dollar bills with crude oil dressing. Yum!
9478 2018-01-31 04:18:23 This is how Obama arrived. Made one rehearsed speech and got labeled Dem rising star. Next thing you know, that snake oil salesman is president.
9479 2018-01-31 04:18:18 Coal is coal.  There is no such thing as clean coal.  Miners need to find new employment.  Don't listen to the snake oil salesman.  Work on new skills and find a new occupation.  Whatever Trump does for coal is short term. Natural gas is cheaper, cleaner and easy to transport.
9480 2018-01-31 04:18:08 Thanks Jimboman :) My mom is now documented. We live in Queens, NY. We are a LARGE Latin population here. I see plenty of people that would be effected if these racist loons get their way. If there are enough people like you in the country, then I can say we'll all be ok :)
9481 2018-01-31 04:17:57 Point is Kim, A good portion of the oil profits go to the people right? Here, not so much.
9482 2018-01-31 04:17:57 Yes the squeaky wheel gets the oil

9486 2018-01-31 04:17:36 Lots of good data analysis as we head into the budget session. I recommend the series by my colleague @avani_kapur in @livemint on sanitation, health, and education & @Roshanjnu's series on rural distress and tax take/oil prices in @htTweets.
9487 2018-01-31 04:17:31 รอไหวมั้ยบอกมาาาาาาาาาาาาาาาาาาาา 555555555555
9488 2018-01-31 04:17:10 I mean, the price of oil and gas is insanely cheap when you think about the ultimate cost of filling the air with CO2.
9489 2018-01-31 04:17:00 Oh, okay. I googled BP Trump and all I could find was about oil. Didn't know how that fit in the conversation. I still do not like all things about Trump, but think he's doing a great job as President!
9490 2018-01-31 04:16:40 What was with the corners of hos mouth...kfc oil?
9491 2018-01-31 04:16:37 its cool guys weed witch here with ya thc oil so we can just drop some oil in and heat the brownie back up a bit for our seperate brownies
9492 2018-01-31 04:16:33 Did he just change the oil,  with his lips?
9493 2018-01-31 04:16:24 Unless you stated that wrong, who purchased the oil in the end is the wrong side of that equation. That US oil companies and construction firms had more pull in the region compared to Russian and French firms was the point. If China was the fields developer, though, it’s news2me.

9522 2018-01-31 04:13:43 The only solution is price the original inputs properly, taking into account future scarcity and planetary impact. Plastic is made of oil, which is a carbon contributor and is increasingly hard to find. Plastic bags should probably be something like $10 a bag.

And yes, I have close family in the steel industry and oil sands business if you are going to continue to be redundant about "manufacturing". Your assumptions are humorous as well as telling

9546 2018-01-31 04:11:08 It was your promise , not the American people. 
You and they have a deal before you.
My advice is take it.

9553 2018-01-31 04:10:38 Venezuela is a dictatorship in the sense that Venezuelans chose their leader through Carter Center-monitored elections, and without American support/interference. The worst kind of dictatorship.

Also they got a lotta oil.
9554 2018-01-31 04:10:38 What is his thing for coal?  Coal is history, but he just can’t admit it’s not going to employ people.  He wants to drill for oil on our coastlines, and that’s not what we want.  Our ecosystems are too fragile for Exxon  to come in and drill baby drill!

9566 2018-01-31 04:09:19 Instead of the couple drops recommended, I definitely just poured oil onto my face. My face is so dry, it's ridiculous.

9601 2018-01-31 04:04:39 Similarly, The OGRA recommended Rs12.74 and Rs11.72 hike in the prices of kerosene oil and light diesel respectively. The price of high speed diesel is likely to exceed Rs 100 per litre,  while petrol price will go up to Rs84.51 per litre from the current Rs 81.53.

Barack Obama used to take credit for this too. In fact, the U.S. has been exporting oil and gas years before Trump took office, largely thanks to industry technological advances outside the control of any president.
9613 2018-01-31 04:03:51 As per details,  The Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (OGRA) has  sent a summary  to Ministry of Petroleum for approval, proposing   an increase  in prices of petrol and diesel by Rs2.98 and Rs10.25 per litre respectively.

9638 2018-01-31 04:01:26 I think she needs the same oil can that they used on the Wizard of Oz Tin Man...
9639 2018-01-31 04:01:14 iS Clinical Cream Cleanser is a creamy formulation that deeply cleanses skin and pores without causing dryness. The rich texture penetrate to leave a silky smooth finish on the skin. Coconut oil and safflower seed oil hydrate and protect. Gentle for use as an eye makeup remover.
9640 2018-01-31 04:01:08 Did Maxine Waters call for seizing the oil companies during her #SOTUResponse, or just impeachment? #SOTU
9641 2018-01-31 04:01:02 I am in favor of developing electric vehicles, that will greatly diminish our reliance on oil, but we still need to power the country and coal is by far the cheapest way to do that.
9642 2018-01-31 04:00:56 Tea tree essential oil is like magic! I have oily skin, and break out a lot and i can put tea tree oil on at night and wake up much better looking skin! Definitely would recommend, and it is not super expensive for a big bottle as you don’t need very much and it lasts a while.
9643 2018-01-31 04:00:47 where to get rosehip seed oil ? and brand life-flo okay tak ?

9647 2018-01-31 04:00:43 lets play the game called how long can we drive my car with 0% oil left til I ruin this piece of shit
9648 2018-01-31 04:00:39 Many live a drive-thru life. We're not talking McDs or other fast food (not our fitness fans!), but express oil changes, microwave meals, Buy Now button on Amazon ... While that approach works with some things, not so to build muscle or lose weight. Patience is your friend.
9649 2018-01-31 04:00:38 The spirit truly is plenteous, but the end thereof as the light; and that which was ordained to offer the blind gropeth in darkness, the LORD to gaze, and many bodies of the log of oil.

9654 2018-01-31 04:00:24 Remember..., she could run the big oil companies better than they do..

9656 2018-01-31 04:00:19 Ethiopia Oil Refinery Planned as Blackstone Pipeline Shelved -
9657 2018-01-31 04:00:19 I've been frustrated with using oil paints because I know I'm good at painting and but oil is a different medium for me It it's a bit complicated
9658 2018-01-31 04:00:09 Figured it out, mine used 5w-30 i don’t understand why bimmers leak oil
9659 2018-01-31 04:00:06 Like deregulations of clean air and water, the food industry, big oil and coal, and much, much more.  Our environment is at risk with 45.

9661 2018-01-31 03:59:57 Damn bro my pubes smell like oil
9662 2018-01-31 03:59:57 The russia sanctions are not aimed oil and gas by the way only selling of advanced oil and gas equipment which is mostly harmless to regime

9668 2018-01-31 03:59:28 I'm not sure what the specific sanctions entail re: who does what. - state dept, Pentagon, who knows. They involve Russian business, oil, etc.
9669 2018-01-31 03:59:28 That’s what I thought! He didn’t want to get the Rubio dry mouth. All that mineral oil obviously can have the crap coming out of both ends!
9670 2018-01-31 03:59:24 Did this guy stop in the middle of changing the oil to give a speech?
9671 2018-01-31 03:59:20 That coconut oil ain’t all that

9674 2018-01-31 03:59:15 I want my car to be fully fixed, its not technically mine yet, needs to be signed over to me but its a 1971 dodge coronet. It needs to be swapped to a diesel or a normal gas engine and ill need to replace all the brakes and tires and oil and spark plugs and a bunch of other stuff
9675 2018-01-31 03:59:07 I have come to believe it merely mutual greed. And God forbid we implement sanctions against Russia when they want Rexxon's Russian oil deal, Flynn's ME nuclear plants, and now the Saudi-Russia oil deal Donnie and Prince Jared are part of. Greed.
9676 2018-01-31 03:59:00 ふたりでひとつ、なるほど
9677 2018-01-31 03:58:59 Still taking the Kennedy stand of supporting Venezuelan oil (by products.)
9678 2018-01-31 03:58:59 A couple tablespoons each of MCT oil should do the trick.

9681 2018-01-31 03:58:32 I use to won't to dig for oil and diamonds ...
9682 2018-01-31 03:58:26 Major problem with his "We choose both!" line. The entire Democrat platform is about taking from one to give to another, its why they want to take from the rich, hurt oil/gas/coal to pump up solar, force cake baking for gay weddings. #demresponse #SOTU
9683 2018-01-31 03:58:22 Some people actually do well with coconut oil, it used to work wonders for my skin in my late teens. Now...a different story.
9684 2018-01-31 03:58:21 I think we should manage our resources.  If we balanced our current oil, natural gas and coal reserves, this country could be completely independent from the rest of the world when it comes to energy, giving us at least a couple hundred years to find suitable
9685 2018-01-31 03:58:19 I do, but it's cause I'm poor  also I have the tea tree oil kind so I guess it's better
9686 2018-01-31 03:58:15 are coconut oil benefits a scam

9688 2018-01-31 03:58:10 The biggest oil related issue of the #SOTU response was the Vaseline issue on Joe Kennedy’s face

9690 2018-01-31 03:58:07 @JimStoppani would taking alpha jym with a bulletproof coffee/tea with coconut oil in it work as “take with food?” and be absorbed properly?
9691 2018-01-31 03:58:05 it seems he put oil/vaseline on his lips and its melting...
9692 2018-01-31 03:58:02 Yes better to ship oil overseas in diesel tankers!
9693 2018-01-31 03:58:01 I know lavender oil can give you moobs, what about syrup?
9694 2018-01-31 03:57:59 It also depends if your skin is oily, normal, or dry. Some people can tolerate oil at different times. I have oily skin so oils go on at night so I can wash them off in the morning! If you have dry skin you can do more. Also Reddit’s Skincare Addiction sub is amazing.

9703 2018-01-31 03:57:23 But, the govt paid Economist, Andrew Leach said Canada does not need Energy East to get a world price for AB oil.
9704 2018-01-31 03:57:22 I love Joe Kennedy, but what is with the car? Did he just take a break from changing his oil?
9705 2018-01-31 03:57:20 pho & tea tree oil
9706 2018-01-31 03:57:18 I can’t believe the kennedys are back

9710 2018-01-31 03:57:06 Time for Joe!! I was watching @RepJoeKennedy #SOTUResponse on FB live, but hard on a smartphone. Handy getting his oil changed & offering rebuttal. #Multitasking
9711 2018-01-31 03:56:59 というか、ほぼ共有状態にある

9713 2018-01-31 03:56:59 J Kennedy got an oil change on his face just like that Stang!! #demlipstho #stateoftheunion
9714 2018-01-31 03:56:54 Goo gone smells like the valve oil I used to use on my tuba. No one else on the internet seems to think so, so I needed to share it with y'all. You're welcome.
9715 2018-01-31 03:56:46 I mean he didn't even change the oil in that car
9716 2018-01-31 03:56:36 and NO MENTION of global warming or oil and gas industries are poisoning everyone #sotu
9717 2018-01-31 03:56:36 Who left the hood up on said car? Did someone not have time to finish the oil change before the speech?

9720 2018-01-31 03:56:24 そういや彼とどっちのがもんはん進んでるの？
9721 2018-01-31 03:56:23 I love their oil free moisturizer with sunscreen!!
9722 2018-01-31 03:56:14 Working in oil&gas is risky. As u know, oil price is very volatile. Back in 2014-2015 when the price dropped to below $50 lots of o&g workers got laid off (including me) So yeah..
9723 2018-01-31 03:55:49 ガンナーどうした。。。

9724 2018-01-31 03:55:46 Roll. Up to the lubetomorrow night if you need a oil change hit me up.
9725 2018-01-31 03:55:46 Joe Kennedy just before the rebuttal, “Oil can. Oil can.”

9727 2018-01-31 03:55:43 Ahhh disagree #Potus44 was a snake oil saslesman..#Potus45 loves America 
9728 2018-01-31 03:55:34 Joe Kennedy III is too rehearsed and insincere. But he is crafty in touting Communism/Socialism. He is a snake oil salesman with promises of #Utopia. But reality of his plan is #Venezuela or #NorthKorea. Don't be fooled.
9729 2018-01-31 03:55:30 We just had the best state of the union in 24 years.
9730 2018-01-31 03:55:25 Foreign oil is equally happy
9731 2018-01-31 03:55:24 Anybody else keep seeing the Snake Oil salesman from Josey Wales when watching Kennedy speak?
9732 2018-01-31 03:55:22 Oh if thats the case then better turn it down, eh? Maybe get a phd & you can be a teaching assistant for the mean time? Step by step heheh. Hmm tbh oil&gas is my passion. Thats my first love lol. But at this age, i actually want a stability in career rather than just a big salary
9733 2018-01-31 03:55:20 Well I don't add oil just distilled water. winter nights are dry in LA.

9740 2018-01-31 03:55:00 so is coconut oil even good for anything ......
9741 2018-01-31 03:55:00 It isn't lies. Besides, oil indirectly funds ISIL and other terrorists in the Middle East.
9742 2018-01-31 03:54:44 I’m pretty sure lavender oil is toxic to cats too
9743 2018-01-31 03:54:39 So what's the plan: nuke Russia and China or invade and take the oil? Or both?
9744 2018-01-31 03:54:37 Your view of the floor is totally obscured by a thick, black oil.
9745 2018-01-31 03:54:34 Terrific news for foreign oil

9753 2018-01-31 03:54:04 What's hurting AB's economy is low oil prices + US shale being far cheaper than anything being produced in AB. Extraction costs are too high, and fuel prices too low. Not any govs fault. Shale may be ABs future more than oil sands
9754 2018-01-31 03:53:57 @russo_raquel OMG!! Thank goodness mom doesn’t use tea tree oil

9760 2018-01-31 03:53:30 Oil prices fall for third day on inventory build.
9761 2018-01-31 03:53:30 Lmfao! When ish and I were talking buddies were trying to be all in the convo like buddie take about 8 steps back from me. No I don’t need your help. I used to run this place. I was in my heels coming from work but I could pour my own quart of oil

9771 2018-01-31 03:52:53 They want to keep the oil barons happy.
9772 2018-01-31 03:52:51 So, did Joe Kennedy swing by the Jiffy Lube and give a speech while having the oil changed?
9773 2018-01-31 03:52:48 I like that Joe is giving his speech while his car gets an oil change.
9774 2018-01-31 03:52:45 It looks to me that Patrick Kennedy III used too much of a by product of the evil oil and gas companies on his lip.  Must be Venezuelan vaseline.
9775 2018-01-31 03:52:44 Why does it seem like there's more focus on oil pipelines than water lines, though?

9779 2018-01-31 03:52:24 Chávez gave away Venezuelan oil riches to Russia, Cuba, China, and Iran years ago. Obama did nothing to stop it. You need to do some research, objectively putting your democ rat bias aside

9789 2018-01-31 03:51:58 Wind energy is much more efficient and a completely free/renewable resource. It's stupid not to take advantage of it. The Republicans only support coal and oil because they're paid to do it. They dont care about you, just their donors.

9793 2018-01-31 03:51:51 Been lubed by good old “oil can henery”
9794 2018-01-31 03:51:50 As far as I’m concerned, as long as I get my oil changes when the sticker tells me to and no lights are on my dash, my car is just fine

9801 2018-01-31 03:51:32 Fight the fight, Jeff.
You should look into CBD oil. Insurance almost certainly wont pay for it, but it's a more holistic approach that's shown allot of promise.
Good luck.
9802 2018-01-31 03:51:31 Stir fry with vegetables and a little bit of soy sauce and sesame oil  just veggies
9803 2018-01-31 03:51:30 The capitalists rob the planet, rip it open for oil and gold, and leave us with nothing but labor.
9804 2018-01-31 03:51:26 What's that oil on Joe Kennedy's whole mouth and lips shining like Crisco in a skillet?
9805 2018-01-31 03:51:25 The Kennedys have never changed their own oil, so I’ll say no.
9806 2018-01-31 03:51:25 He need to choose a napkin and wipe the oil off his lips and chin
9807 2018-01-31 03:51:21 America needs an oil change
9808 2018-01-31 03:51:17 Mostly people want to decrease to Oil rate in this budget
9809 2018-01-31 03:51:15 You ain’t saying nothing slick to a can of oil
9810 2018-01-31 03:51:10 That would be the oil industry.
9811 2018-01-31 03:51:10 Whoa, I did not expect at the Democratic response would be Joe Kennedy giving a car a complete oil and filter change on live TV
9812 2018-01-31 03:51:09 Listen to Democratic response to #SOTU, get a free oil change.

9831 2018-01-31 03:49:21 Name one. If you could make 6 figures by doing something that is supposedly easy, the only reason you wouldn't is if you prefer a job that either pays even more or a job that is even easier.

9837 2018-01-31 03:49:07 No OIL, No LIFE!!!
9838 2018-01-31 03:49:01 I just assumed he's speaking to kill time waiting for his oil change and tire rotation at Jiffy Lube.
9839 2018-01-31 03:49:01 Either that or he just drank a bottle of cooking oil....
9840 2018-01-31 03:49:01 Who defected in the 90's, during the "Arduous March" when terrible famines hit North Korea.  This was during the time of the Agreed Framework, when our promises of aid and heating oil could have made life bearable for North Koreans.  But our political gamesmanship nixed that aid.

9843 2018-01-31 03:48:58 I’m telling you, try chiffonading your collard greens and throw them into some garlic and oil and salt for 2 minutes - you can probably make the whole thing less time than a garnish and it’s delicious and healthy
9844 2018-01-31 03:48:57 Who’s everyone? Only oil clubs do this
9845 2018-01-31 03:48:55 #Lipgloss Joe Kennedy. He has too much lip gloss or he drank too much oil..

9848 2018-01-31 03:48:39 Coconut oil is a demon. NOPE.

(people with good skin due to genetics should really shut the fuck up with the skincare advice)
9849 2018-01-31 03:48:30 Will Kennedy change my oil when he is done?  #SOTU

9857 2018-01-31 03:48:06 Try telling that to coal miners in Montana. Or mill workers . Or oil workers these are my family  my neighbors  the unemployed  during Obama. You try going from $47,000 to $17,000 tell me Obama  did this. This is reality we lived. Now we are getting our jobs back.
9858 2018-01-31 03:48:05 Looks like he gets a free oil change with each speech he makes.
9859 2018-01-31 03:47:51 i don’t use tea tree oil dumdum
9860 2018-01-31 03:47:43 It was nice of JK III to take a break from his oil change to deliver the Dem response.
9861 2018-01-31 03:47:24 Из комментариев на двд к фильму “Армагеддон”: «I asked Michael why it’s was easier to train oil drillers to become astronauts than it was to train astronauts to become oil drillers and he told me to shut the fuck up»
9862 2018-01-31 03:47:20 But if/when there IS adequate response measures for a dilbit spill will you then find other pretexts to oppose them?? I support increased dilbit oil exports by rail and/or pipeline PROVIDED there are adequate safety measures in place and proper FN UNDRIP deals and enviro protexns
9863 2018-01-31 03:47:08 what doeos this mean. my half virgin oil ears dont know.
9864 2018-01-31 03:46:54 Did Joe Kennedy have a slice of pizza before getting on the podium.  thAt oil dripping on the sides of his mouth is not letting me concentrate #SOTU

9867 2018-01-31 03:46:40 SOTU.Americans are Dreamers too (all lives matter). All immigrants are criminals. We need a wall. We will reform our prisons. Guantanamo will stay open-just signed the bill.

9871 2018-01-31 03:46:25 First time making empanadas on my own: Only lost one in the making. Oil popped into my eye. I would say I was pretty successful.

9874 2018-01-31 03:46:18 What’s going on with the oil around his mouth
9875 2018-01-31 03:46:14 by the looks of the oil industry I would say Yes .

9895 2018-01-31 03:44:44 I suppose you blame NDP for the fall in oil prices and result and drop in revenues that year! No new agri taxes. Increased job growth, decrease in oil corp susidies, approved pipelines, safety for AB farm workers, etc... AB benefiting from demise of PC in AB
9896 2018-01-31 03:44:41 what happened with the link where castor oil was exposed

9902 2018-01-31 03:44:17 people wouldn’t need vicodin or oxys if they had cannabis cbd oil which isn’t even psychoactive. it’s not addictive and doesn’t fuck w your liver
9903 2018-01-31 03:44:09 Chants of “USA, USA”. This snake oil salesman has turned the #SOTU into nothing more than a pep rally. All style, zero substance. Do not blindly follow people!!! #sotu2018
9904 2018-01-31 03:43:59 My friend noted: no ban/moratorium on current oil shipments, which provide feedstock for current refining/gas in BC, or ban/moratorium on refined products (ie gas) so BC position is Alberta can ship just enough so they can fill their gas tanks, now fuck off, how neighbourly!
9905 2018-01-31 03:43:55 Crazy how adamantly some people try to make a stand against marijuana. I don't smoke the crap myself but using CBD oil has basically added years to my life due to not chucking naproxen and worse down my throat. Alcohol is abominable by comparison. TF it good for? Wrecks&fights?
9906 2018-01-31 03:43:55 Lol yeah... I use shea butter and it has done wonders. Coconut oil is wayyy too oily and it breaks me out smh 
9907 2018-01-31 03:43:37 I read her books in the 80s and tried to follow her advice, but the food tasted so awful  I went  back to butter and olive oil.
9908 2018-01-31 03:43:37 *Lemme just drop this right here*

Coconut oil is amazing lol
9909 2018-01-31 03:43:33 When I change my oil, I buy a new filter. it's the same make, model, color, shape and size as the old filter, but it's new. New ideas and policies from the GOP are like that. It's always "cut taxes, raise defense spending, slash social programs", presented afresh every year.

9911 2018-01-31 03:43:27 In my defense, I had gotten the suburban and they SAID they fixed the oil leaks, so my guess was that the oil was low to begin with... I just never bothered to check it. #Dumb
9912 2018-01-31 03:43:23 today has made me feel really good. I made a really tough decision, payed all my bills, filed my taxes, changed the oil in my car, filled up my gas tank, washed and folded clothes, cleaned the kitchen, and now i’m ready to meditate and fall asleep. 
9913 2018-01-31 03:43:22 ある意味、インフルより深刻な気もしますが・・・・。
まずは休んで下さい(´・ω・｀)

9915 2018-01-31 03:43:18 My rosehip oil came in and I can’t wait to use it.
9916 2018-01-31 03:43:12 Think of a constant enormous GDP numbers during UPA I & II despite crude oil at all time high.

Modi inherited healthy FOREX of 300 billion, got lucky with good Monsoon and lowest crude prices.

Despite above, blame Congress?
9917 2018-01-31 03:43:10 You welcome I hope you have some oil

9924 2018-01-31 03:42:32 7 x as many. Solar employs 2x oil and gas. It’s the future. And it’s manufacturing and it’s jobs all the way down the line from sales, office and installation. And it saves our planet and clears our air.
9925 2018-01-31 03:42:21 Thanks for the heads up!!! I had plenty of time to do a hot oil treatment and blow dry my hair! Looks good! Lol
9926 2018-01-31 03:42:07 There is so much musk and beard oil on this show, Greenpeace is rescuing birds and washing the slick off with detergent.... @TalksMachina
9927 2018-01-31 03:42:01 Nissan how could you go from having the oil filter on the 240sx KA24DE on the side of the engine block right under the intake manifold inside the engine bay easy access to placing it under the car under the exhaust manifold / downpipe?? Backwards engineering
9928 2018-01-31 03:42:00 hot oil treatment tonight, straight hair tomorrow 
9929 2018-01-31 03:41:41 Looks like Alberta can only ship oil & gas, south to the US.
9930 2018-01-31 03:41:32 … would we not burn (nyuk nyuk) through that coal all the sooner as we try to supplant our use of oil and gas?
3- Even of the short term economic benefit of coal is longer than what I assume: is there not an opportunity cost in falling behind on the emerging sectors?
9931 2018-01-31 03:41:27 Y'all, my mom friend just came over and started putting holy oil on my head and all over my room and saying how my gayness shall be cured...smh
9932 2018-01-31 03:41:24 Try Vitamin E Oil
9933 2018-01-31 03:41:16 I’m watching Moonlight, not that snake oil salesman.
9934 2018-01-31 03:41:10 Yea I left the oil on for 15 min then washed it , it's only a tiny bit starting to come out so I hope it don't start coming out in clumps . I know they said it can take up to 6-12 months for it to go away 
9935 2018-01-31 03:41:05 #StateofOurUnionnthis guy is talking like he’s going to spend billions of dollars on all these programs gets promising,  it’s just snake oil.
9936 2018-01-31 03:41:03 ทุกอย่างพังเพราะเราทำมันพังเอง ใจอ่อนแอเพราะเราสร้างเอง ทำมันเองต้องรักษาเอง.
9937 2018-01-31 03:41:03 If it's for acne means okay la that's the job for it but otherwise means no. Check out body shop: super mild and not stinging and non drying. Argan oil/ rosehip/ grape seed is fine. They're milder oils.
9938 2018-01-31 03:40:59 Don't be naar like that. If your team didn't stop winning trophies in what was it the 90's or early 2000's you could also have had an oil boss. Yoh!! And the number of managers.......
9939 2018-01-31 03:40:53 いろいろかきまわしてこ
9940 2018-01-31 03:40:52 Will give them Saudi Arabia and any demonstrations are all lies forgot the Iraqi resistance, where the Norman from Iraq and imagine the migration is useful only owners of killing in the Gulf and oil and Qatar and all of the lie is a puff
9941 2018-01-31 03:40:51 Boleh ke gunakan cleansing oil if tak pakai make up? Just to clean our face.
9942 2018-01-31 03:40:40 Idk, is it a thing to oil up for a photoshoot?
9943 2018-01-31 03:40:36 Looks great!! I need to use an oil nightly, I'm sooo dry. Cali weather 
9944 2018-01-31 03:40:28 I swear my oil diffuser is running on over drive lately
9945 2018-01-31 03:40:27 I had 6 puffs of my new hash oil pen and I passed out dead  when you think you a G, but you’re narcoleptic
9946 2018-01-31 03:40:24 Try baby oil
9947 2018-01-31 03:40:19 Then you have the government in BC trying to regulate the pipeline with new setbacks to make it harder for Canada to get their oil out to market. No biggie the US are more than happy to be an energy superpower.
9948 2018-01-31 03:40:19 Godrej agrovet, look there good managment Company related to the agricultural business where diversified in 5 category as below with revenue contribution
1)animal feed :- 47%

9949 2018-01-31 03:40:19 Heempseed oil nya cara carrier, tp hempseed oil apapun jg bagus sih
9950 2018-01-31 03:40:13 いつもよりストーリーすごくしっかりしてたけど確かに王道主人公って感じだったもんね
フィールドの草花を取り尽くすツアーですね任せてください
9951 2018-01-31 03:40:12 それそれ！一式嫌いだったなぁ。同じモンスターばっかり狩る羽目になるんだもん
素晴らしいと思います
9952 2018-01-31 03:40:10 これ？ドレッシングっていうか廃油。
9953 2018-01-31 03:40:05 What are you referring to here?
If you mean that monetary trade is not the only form of trade, you'd be correct. People can trade goods and services in barter but this requires that you find someone that has what you want and will take for it what you will give up to get it.
9954 2018-01-31 03:40:04 /rlt/ kalo aku adain GA body scrub+essence oil+bath salt tp ongkir tanggung sendiri ada yg minat kah?
9955 2018-01-31 03:40:02 No. I wasn't. You're just morally blind and as much a snake oil salesman as the orange god whom you worship. That's why you either don't see the obvious, or pretend not to see it.

I'd offer you my sympathies, but I'm not that kind to enablers of enemies of my country.
9956 2018-01-31 03:40:01 เราจะผ่านช่วงนี้ไปได้ยังไง ทำไมเราอ่อนแออยู่แบบนี้

9958 2018-01-31 03:39:26 Hmm Iran, isn’t that the country whose democratic goverment we helped to overthrow because they were going to nationalize their oil production
9959 2018-01-31 03:39:21 Coconut oil is for ur body or hair not your damn face. Smh.
9960 2018-01-31 03:39:14 And now that I’m on my plane from #IAD to #DEN I’m convinced half the people on this flight work for the oil and gas industry. Thanks for keeping our country running, guys! @Siemens
9961 2018-01-31 03:39:12 What about that one where they're smuggling gold plates but they crash land in upstate New York, burry it somewhere, then get rescued by golden DC-8 planes w/no turbines but forgot the plates. Then some years later, a snake oil salesman trips over the burial site in his backyard.
9962 2018-01-31 03:39:12 剛チケww

9967 2018-01-31 03:38:38 same  I always have to use oil absorbing sheets throughout the day. it sucks!!
9968 2018-01-31 03:38:31 剛チケあたりやばかったイメージ(´ω｀)
ドスやって無いやwトライは…すいちゅう…うん
9969 2018-01-31 03:38:24 I heard that this lady used the oil named breathe for her kid that was choking & didn’t get why they didn’t stop choking. Luckily the kid didn’t die
9970 2018-01-31 03:38:16 I’ve got a pillow top mattress pad, lavender essential oil humidifier, Himalayan salt lamp and a machine playing ocean sounds. Why do I ever leave my room????
9971 2018-01-31 03:38:04 ハーレー 警告灯『オイルプレッシャー』赤いオイル給油缶のマーク解説 Harley Davidson Street Bob Oil pressure
9972 2018-01-31 03:38:02 I get it. There are a lot of charlatans out there selling snake oil and quackery. these 3 individuals are not part of that category.
9973 2018-01-31 03:37:35 Compared to this time last year, the overall US rig count is up by 329, with oil rigs up by 279, gas rigs up by 52, and miscellaneous rigs down by two.

Podemos Traducirlo si es Necesario !!!
9974 2018-01-31 03:37:35 Coal is a dangerous dying industry instead of looking to the future and truly making USA energy independent GOP stick with polluting fuels instead of promoting and supporting clean green energy! Notice Chinese doing it while we continue to subsidize big oil & coal!
9975 2018-01-31 03:37:31 Would be nice to get the oil field going again so many people are out of work in the south and being a single father raising a wonderful girl is stressful enough with not knowing if there will even be work next week.much respect fir the hob you are doing  @realDonaldTrump
9976 2018-01-31 03:37:29 "ADD OIL"  take all the naps you can
9977 2018-01-31 03:37:24 This speech was as unifying as oil and water
9978 2018-01-31 03:37:14 Have you tried castor oil?
9979 2018-01-31 03:36:55 I use it on my hair and body, but it’s a kind that’s made for moisturizing, I’d never use the just straight up cooking oil version, my ass would be slipping and sliding
9980 2018-01-31 03:36:48 Its 2018 and people are still putting coconut oil on their faces
9981 2018-01-31 03:36:43 I get over loaded on Pinterest looking at the healing properties of natural herbs...basically consume everything...every herb and oil!lol #givemethatgoodherb
9982 2018-01-31 03:36:38 Look to the dems and what they forced banks to loan. And to whom. That was what caused the bubble and crash. It’s quite thoroughly documented. But, hey, liberals and facts are like oil and water.
9983 2018-01-31 03:36:35 今までのシステムだと脳みそで考えるのは限界があったからなぁ
今回のスキルはなんとなくでそれっぽい装備ができるのでめっちゃ評価したい
9984 2018-01-31 03:36:34 i usually wash my face, tone it w with hazel or rose water and put tea tree oil on the problem spots + then use vitamin E oil
9985 2018-01-31 03:36:28 This nigga darker than 3am talking about he mixed. Mixed with what? Dirt & Oil  he was mad asf
9986 2018-01-31 03:36:28 That 1%  look is so damn irritating! Lol!  

Interesting the judges looked so stern and no applause. Also,  no mention of big oil just Corporations. Oh well its Trump! Too many props on cue untrusting demeanor like a snake in the grass!
9987 2018-01-31 03:36:27 どこ？
9988 2018-01-31 03:36:19 Want to measure the temprature in a room? Don't have a thermometer? Coconut oil is a great alternative.
9989 2018-01-31 03:36:17 He is the modern day equivalent of the the old timey medicine show men, peddling his snake oil.
9990 2018-01-31 03:36:05 Excedrin Migraine works for me. Also, lavender oil on forehead, temples and behind neck.
9991 2018-01-31 03:36:00 Good to know.  I’ve many questions.

1- I’d seen a similar number once upon a time on the @EIAgov website. What assumptions does that make for our energy usage?
2- Our use of fossil fuels would shift to coal over time anyway (time frames for oil and gas are shorter, yes?), so…
9992 2018-01-31 03:35:59 @realDonaldTrump Great job Mr President  #SOTU
9993 2018-01-31 03:35:54 People with no fucking acne or pores or blackheads to begin with: I just use coconut oil skincare ain’t that deep 
9994 2018-01-31 03:35:51 Id notice when I had hair and Id do twist outs and it used to cause build up on my scalp instead of soaking in like lets say olive oil would. Used to be gross so I read about it and never used again. Unless mixing with lotion after shaving.
9995 2018-01-31 03:35:43 They may need some olive oil, there was a lot of facts there that was hard to swallow
9996 2018-01-31 03:35:42 i love coconut water , coconut milk , coconut oil , coconut scented anything , shit ... i love coconut everything.
9997 2018-01-31 03:35:35 Tequila with a couple drops of peppermint oil works pretty good for that I hear.
9998 2018-01-31 03:35:30 世界観は超好き。
ただ私は一般MOBハンターになりたいので、ストーリーは不必要でした。仕方のないことだけど。
一緒に薬草摘みしようね
9999 2018-01-31 03:35:12 Your really are a clown.  You stand with dreamers!!! What about real Americans.   What about immigrants that have done things by the law.   Best example for u is a snake oil salesmen
10000 2018-01-31 03:35:10 Because Putin LOVES coal & oil.
10001 2018-01-31 03:35:04 Yeah, but functionally, "clean coal" is still dirty than every alternative, it's just polluting marginally less. The only reason it hasn't gone the way of whale oil is jobs in swing states. In that way, it's not all that different from ethanol.
10002 2018-01-31 03:35:03 I hope not, it certainly shouldn't be released. I think you are going to be disappointed though. The US does a bunch of business with Russia in the oil and gas industry. Russia was only made to be the devil in the past year or so.
10003 2018-01-31 03:35:03 スキルポイント足らない〜ってのが無くなった代わりに、風圧や咆哮無効とかはガチで一式いくレベルで揃えないと出来ない
10004 2018-01-31 03:34:59 Yes, he knows how to sell: snake oil
10005 2018-01-31 03:34:13 Use olive oil
10006 2018-01-31 03:33:59 Its actually one of the worst oils for you because its comedogenic oil meaning it doesnt really dissipate or absorb, it sits and it clogs your pores. Look it up.
10007 2018-01-31 03:33:53 Practice tomorrow will start at 3:30 instead of 4:00. Colonial has a Saginaw Valley Conference Match at 6:00 and they have to oil.
