1 2018-11-15 23:59:44 Baking is cited as a healthy alternative to frying, but let me tell you, douse everything in enough oil and it doesn’t have to be!

40 2018-11-15 23:55:17 Time to cut some output in KSA and sell oil in RMB with @LukeGromen as the middleman
41 2018-11-15 23:55:12 When a country thinks that can change the world on its own... fossil fuels will be dominant for the next decades and a lower oil price will only reduce the motivation to keep the development of alternative sources of energy

54 2018-11-15 23:53:43 Is one person responsible for a hockey team not doing well? The PM is one person in our entire parliament & not solely responsible for any province’s issues.  Why have we increased oil production when demand is lower? Why don’t we have more refineries, and less tax on Cdn gas?

73 2018-11-15 23:52:10 Check the maritime territory of Orkney, Shetland and western Isles. You will find a large portion of that oil is withint their territory. Ergo, technically belongs to them. (If we are playing the who does it belong to game)

88 2018-11-15 23:50:24 You know why: Charles Koch. That *****le is almost single-handedly destroying our planet just so he can keep raking in cash from coal and tar sands oil. He's a disgusting pig.

93 2018-11-15 23:49:54 Neat! Oil sands mining and sagd are well suited for automation due to their large scale and closed environments. The shale side requires highly mobile equipment and hands-on labour to assemble it on site. Machines are à long way off from having the dexterity required.
94 2018-11-15 23:49:53 He shares ALBERTA'S frustration at the billions of dollars being lost the the CANADIAN economy. 
Does that make any fuckin' sense at all? Liberals love to squander money, so why don't they want to squander these oil billions.? The scope of their stupidity is intergalactic.
95 2018-11-15 23:49:32 Here’s a thought. What are the chances of US special interest groups interfering with Canadian oil in order for AB to get fed up and join the US, thereby getting access to our oil AND water?

107 2018-11-15 23:47:33 Something like jojoba or almond oil. Something to dilute the peppermint oil so it doesn’t irritate your skin. 

I use peppermint oil/ice when I max out on abortive meds to avoid rebound headaches
108 2018-11-15 23:46:55 Well done @IcelandFoods for highlighting the plight of the #RangTan. It would be even better if you did not sell other companies’ palm oil-containing products such as @GreggsOfficial pasties either - nowhere on their packaging does it say ‘sustainable palm oil’

110 2018-11-15 23:46:45 Everyone’s outraged over palm oil and want it banned because of an animated orangutan... Now we just gotta make another 927492749295 animated videos on the other ways we’re fucking up this planet and we might be okay 
111 2018-11-15 23:46:41 @armstrongcbc I just listened to your 6 PM news story on the dropping cost of oil due to the surplus. Very interesting but I do have one complaint. Why do you use the American pronunciation of IRAN? Set a good example for Canadians please.

118 2018-11-15 23:45:40 It seems that cars and trucks use the oil to get folks around. Perhaps we should wean Ontario off the auto industry, then there would be no problem.  Shut down the fishing boats, the trains, the planes, the buses and the subways, no problem. Wean people off of food, heat, light.
119 2018-11-15 23:45:34 Canada's oil and gas industry is privatized.     Any rise in oil prices goes directly to the American-owned oil companies.    70% of tarsands is foreign-owned.

All this talk of scaling back production (to increase price), only benefits the American oil cos.   #pnpcbc #cdnpoli

123 2018-11-15 23:44:57 Especially when certain coastal regions near Norway have stopped seismic testing and oil drilling due to environmental risks and damage. Why is our goofy , sausage sizzle, pie man govt letting it happen in an area that should be declared a World  Heritage site?
124 2018-11-15 23:44:53 Blue collar jobs growing at the fastest pace in 30 yrs makes me proud. 100k new jobs in oil/gas production makes me proud. 3.9 million people lifted off food stamps makes me proud. Median Hispanic income rising above $50k/yr for the first time in history makes me proud.
125 2018-11-15 23:44:51 Also if you consider that many plastics are made from oil & that most oil is from fossils, there's almost nothing vegan in the world.

142 2018-11-15 23:42:27 Producing oil is only 20% of the GHG as opposed to when it is BURNED IN THE CARS YOU PRODUCE which produces 80% of the GHG. Shut your factories and quit producing those GHG spewing, environment destroying AUTOS. Do that and we'll talk. What's that? You won't? Thought so

148 2018-11-15 23:41:16 I was talking to my guy manager about it, he said he went to school for it it’s an easy job that involves replacing the filter and draining the old oil & adding the new one. Ask your dad if he’d be down to teach me I’ll pay for lessons 
149 2018-11-15 23:41:06 What gives my skin the glow that it has?

151 2018-11-15 23:40:48 ...that’s cash from oil that the US (and Washington think tanks especially) can’t survive without. He’s just carrying on a fine,  longstanding (quite sensible) tradition of not biting the hand that feeds you. But you knew all that already.
152 2018-11-15 23:40:43 @SYSKPodcast Darn you both!!  Olive Oil has environmental hazards as as a bi-product of production!!!!  I could have gone my whole life with out knowing that.  I'm an environmental protection freak but I need the Oil of the Gods to live.  Damn you.  This is a very sad day indeed.
153 2018-11-15 23:40:32 They use Viking sails. Damn you oil company for providing me with a product not only used to run my boat but to build it and my nets. It’s all your fault I want to drive to work and heat my house. If you didn’t provide that product I could just catch fish all day easy.

155 2018-11-15 23:40:27 @PnPCBC Listening to the interview with the oil industry representative, lamenting that more pipelines aren't being built, reminds me of what Noam Chomsky said: "These people want to stuff their pockets with as much cash as possible before the planet becomes uninhabitable."
156 2018-11-15 23:40:25 I’ve been reading your tweets and I really hope you find something for your migraines. I have chronic migraines & I know the struggle. 

Not to be one of those people but in a crunch, I massage a bit of peppermint oil (with a carrier oil) into my temples/nape and use ice packs.
157 2018-11-15 23:40:25 Oh yes. We are all happy wen politicians say "Tax the rich!". However, most all rich people, pay themselves $1 A year, & have the bulk of assets in "trust", they live off an "expense account". Just like taxing BIG OIL! They simply pass that tax increase to we "little people".

159 2018-11-15 23:39:59 I feed my dog what I eat. If I make chicken baked in cocoanut oil, that's what she gets.
160 2018-11-15 23:39:59 Why do you like Europeans to the regime of the Islamic Republic of Iran? For oil?
161 2018-11-15 23:39:53 @POTUS why don't we spray oil on the boarder wall that illegals are able to climb. That should hold them for awhile!

"Calories in-calories out" is totally defunct as nutritional advice. 

Seed oils -- not butter and olive oil -- are what are killing (and emasculating) you. 

The low-fat/high-carb USDA food pyramid of 1979 has destroyed 10's of millions
165 2018-11-15 23:39:18 Pity you’re using cheap inferior chocolate in most of your products and destroying the environment and causing the deaths of orangutans, for palm oil!
166 2018-11-15 23:39:16 I always put in a serum on damp hair on the ends of my hair and whatever is left on my palms I run through my scalp but I make sure it’s little to no oil on them when I do the scalp part.
167 2018-11-15 23:39:06 Just roll with it. Buy other random things: plunger, pliers, magnum condoms and a quart of oil.
168 2018-11-15 23:39:03 I’m out of lavender oil and I’m sobbing because I use it every day
169 2018-11-15 23:38:58 *Put more oil on the kart* Heh HEH heh #Dingobot
170 2018-11-15 23:38:50 Is everyone frying a turkey this year or was there just a huge discount on vats of peanut oil this year?
171 2018-11-15 23:38:49 Is he aware how many died on the convoys? I would love to meet this man and tell him about the realities of being torpedoed and seeing your crew mates being burnt alive after the oil caught fire. Jesus are these the people directing the way of the country?
172 2018-11-15 23:38:48 Haven't seen any illegal camp outs in quebec protesting oil tankers from saudi arabia lately .
173 2018-11-15 23:38:45 i had to get our oil changed and tires replaced snd i didnt bring any school work so now i have to read 2 history chapters and research everything that affects visual perception:)))
174 2018-11-15 23:38:41 Plus I will never have to change oil and deal with other maintenance issues. And I can choose to charge at non-peak hours at 12 cents/kwh to help balance the grid load! :)

みてくださーい
177 2018-11-15 23:38:20 I thought there was a line showing how much oil to use. Anything over that amount has consequences.
178 2018-11-15 23:38:18 Don’t believe this nonsense. Vitamin D and fish oil are crucial to your health. Please do your own research.
179 2018-11-15 23:38:17 In Alberta yes we do, in Canada i am not so sure   Sell oil for a nickle to the USA, buy it back for a dime , sell it to the people for a quarter.  Just made a profit
180 2018-11-15 23:37:59 there's clouds on the horizon and oil at our feet

long walk ahead of us and a long walk behind
181 2018-11-15 23:37:35 Scheer the Moron doesnt have a plan other than ignore climate change. Even the big oil companies support a cap approach.
182 2018-11-15 23:37:28 Means nothing. Depends how long it takes to extract. Depends how kuch oil is there and the cost to extract and the oil prices at Thames time of extraction. And the profit made. We could get 100m. In total over several years.

 We get 10000m per year from UK union.

185 2018-11-15 23:37:13 just found out that peppermint oil is flammable. all is okay but I’m having trouble relocating where my heart went when it just jumped out of my body. don’t add peppermint oil to your candles. don’t do it
186 2018-11-15 23:36:55 I could oil some gears with the mafia :P
187 2018-11-15 23:36:53 Fix it the bolts are lose it needs an oil change @DrPhil before we change that bitch
188 2018-11-15 23:36:35 my housemate’s been sleeping really badly recently because of anxiety so tonight i wrote him a little positivity note with instructions for the chamomile tea i left him and my eucalyptus oil and i really need them to work for him as well as they do for me 
189 2018-11-15 23:36:33 However he's also claimed that the Syrians don't hold any oil fields.

Managing to forget about the entire middle of the country in the process.

194 2018-11-15 23:35:23 Think the sold bottom in oil is in?
195 2018-11-15 23:35:18 Check it out, right on the back. Ingredients are listed according to amount, so first ingredient is the most, youll likely see corn syrup 2nd, its sweeter than sugar & cheaper. I think the "oil" is 3rd or 4th.
196 2018-11-15 23:35:16 All Iceland’s own brand products are palm oil free 
197 2018-11-15 23:35:06 @CBCAlerts @PMcanadien @CanadianPM @JustinTrudeau TELL the Whining Oil Companies to GROW UP- they are a dying industry- DON’T THREATEN to cut your Production to Raise Prices- Move with the Times (bet the owner of horses didn’t like evolving to cars- now we are evolving again)

Point of correction, that request is dead on arrival,

If I ask you to put your hand in a burning oil, will you do it?

Or you want make somebody loose the litle ground wey remain?

202 2018-11-15 23:34:44 Never knew there was an oil free fryer big enough for a turkey.

206 2018-11-15 23:34:05 Haha, once it dips below 70 here for our 2 weeks of winter, people start building fires in oil drums to survive the night.
207 2018-11-15 23:34:02 1 employs thousands of canadians and pumps billions of revenue the other just pumps shit and pollutes . Why you never hear anybody harping about oil tankers on the east coast ?
208 2018-11-15 23:33:54 Thank you @wildforcongress for joining @marygayscanlon in pledging not to accept money from oil and gas producers or their lobby. #NoFossilFuelMoney
209 2018-11-15 23:33:38 Aww...hemp oil helped our old dog, Rufus, with his arthritic joints in his last years.  Shadow is a handsome guy. 
210 2018-11-15 23:33:36 Might be too risky, but there are proven benefits to low and high amounts vertical integration.
Like I said, steel and oil pulled it off, many others failed miserably.
211 2018-11-15 23:33:35 The oil price has recovered and demand is increasing by a lot. But we’re land locked and over regulated by phoney protesters and a horribly inept gov’t. We could be decreasing the burden on the entire country
(And ourselves).
212 2018-11-15 23:33:34 Toppers leaking oil in the backstretch. Have let Valpo back in with a porous man to man defense. Toppers lead for now, 62:56. 11:23
213 2018-11-15 23:33:17 People think that taxing us more or getting rid of oil products altogether will change the climate. This is beyond absurd. Nothing we do will change anything. Canada absorbs more CO2 than we emit.  People are brainwashed.
214 2018-11-15 23:33:11 Oil and Coal companies have done the same for 100 years.
215 2018-11-15 23:32:51 I'm looking for investors .. I need to get some projects off the ground ..one is a castor oil manufacturing plant in Jamaica to help develop the industry. Also need investors for a real estate crowdfunfing platform .. jamaicans roll out and start support ..I'm ready to present.
216 2018-11-15 23:32:39 Some women really be clueless about their cars. One chick I used to work with bought a brand new Kia Optima and the engine locked up on her 3 months later cause she didn’t know you had to get an oil change. She 30+ smh.
217 2018-11-15 23:32:35 Man Tip: Beard oil works.
218 2018-11-15 23:32:31 Hindi ba inamin na ni hinDut na wala na syang magagawa sa inflation dahil wala daw tayong oil. Wala din syang magagawa sa talamak na corruption at hindi na rin nya masusugpo ang drug problem sa buong termino na? Kaya ano pang gagawin nya kundi matulog at mamasyal!

221 2018-11-15 23:32:18 Amen sister!!! How it should be! No one even glance at my mum the wrong way before I rip their head off, run them over with a truck, cut them to pieces, dip them in oil, set them in fire. Well you get my point  Mum is sacred!!! No one messes with my mum OMG she’s so amazing!
222 2018-11-15 23:32:18 Heavy oil sells at prices competitive with Maya in Gulf Coast so it is not suffering from the discount. Producers explain this in their analyst calls. How many barrels of heavy oil do you believe are exposed to the discount as major producers say they are not.
223 2018-11-15 23:32:14 Put something slippery on the fence.. Like grease or oil.. So they can't climb up
224 2018-11-15 23:31:56 I work for a heating oil company and people are calling in like there is a missile heading towards nyc 
225 2018-11-15 23:31:51 PSA: tea tree oil is extremely poisonous to dogs.
226 2018-11-15 23:31:46 Too right my man.  We was covered by the witch and broomstick.  The beautiful sun shone all the time there.  It was beautiful. Meeting of minds music and dance. Oil can you turn your music down!!!
227 2018-11-15 23:31:44 yelling Lehman Brothers kiss the ring part II and then spitting in the face of the "oil" traders who are part Jewish by training and still nobody could remember the directions to the dais lined by Burt's ladders and yet Nancy Pelosi would second the nomination of Sarbanes for ...
228 2018-11-15 23:31:42 Oh i know, so do I  Oil can do terrible things. I hope it isn't true
229 2018-11-15 23:31:42 Because they are taking money from the f’ing oil and gas industry and sending this to committee when the science they need is indisputable and more than  two decades old.
230 2018-11-15 23:31:22 Formula for success: rise early, work hard, strike oil.

232 2018-11-15 23:30:54 Really tough topic at the moment, unfortunately small businesses won't be able to compete with big traders if this happened all at once! I know some outlets charging literally double for "sustainably farmed" palm oil. I don't even believe it costs twice as much to make it!!!
233 2018-11-15 23:30:48 Tell him to use cold pressed castor oil

235 2018-11-15 23:30:37 Current economic orthodoxy is the modern day snake oil. The Government tax us to spend the money on us. It’s an insurance against an uncivil society.

240 2018-11-15 23:29:26 Will #palmoil standards body @RSPOtweets ever champion real sustainability? This week its members vote on whether to clamp down on labour abusers like @Indofood who go on selling palm oil marked with its logo #RT16 #RSPO
241 2018-11-15 23:29:25 I needed an oil change! Nothing good ever happens when you get your oil changed! Now I have over $1200 of repairs that need to be made!
242 2018-11-15 23:29:20 Do we wonder why no one is picketing this? No one has chained themselves to valve openings? Why no camps have been set up to express their disgust at what can only be described as polluting waterways. Do you think its because they are only being paid to frustrate oil and gas.
243 2018-11-15 23:29:11 Do they sell coconut oil?
244 2018-11-15 23:29:09 It would be great if we had more of her story. I see bottles of oil but there is no information on whether she refines the oil or has bought wholesale oil and decanted into recycled bottles.
245 2018-11-15 23:29:00 That's like me askin you to put your hand in a burning oil,

Will you do it?

As it is now, "OshoBribe" and "GanDollar" are untouchable,

You want somebody to loose the litle ground left for him? 

Naija we hail thee o
246 2018-11-15 23:28:56 anndddd it doesn’t contain palm oil!
247 2018-11-15 23:28:43 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.
248 2018-11-15 23:28:38 This is so dreadful and moblike. I don’t want our government involved in this. I don’t want our government to sell these sadists weapons or make any deals with them at all. We need to end our dependence on foreign oil; the price is TOO HIGH. Ugh. Ugh. Ugh.
249 2018-11-15 23:28:27 "plenty of oil " you should know not all is all the same

252 2018-11-15 23:27:50 If you’re buying “lip plumping” lipglosses: Cinnamon oil, is what plumps your lips. It is in the majority of “lip plumper” lipglosses and you’re better off to do it yourself. Plain cinnamon oil is too strong! Dilute it with lip oil/scrub. Using a brush & chapstick does wonders!
253 2018-11-15 23:27:50 Even without retouching or body oil, much better than a certain possibly more famous Slovenian currently residing on Pennsylvania Ave.

258 2018-11-15 23:27:10 CBD oil. Some ppl who nothing else works for pull throw on that because it disrupts malignant DNA 2 age quickly allowing the body  2 fight.
259 2018-11-15 23:27:08 もちもちしてますね
260 2018-11-15 23:27:08 I don't understand,, Sai dai Idan Kannan Kane ko en uwan ka shine you'll understand what's at stake
261 2018-11-15 23:27:02 Not including the oil subsidies btw
262 2018-11-15 23:26:55 Yes I understand that pipelines are safer. The thing is that we need to spend more on clean energy more than oil and gas. What the pipeline does is it makes it simpler to move oil and gas which makes us more addicted to oil. Burning oil and gas causes Climate Change.
263 2018-11-15 23:26:49 how hard is changing your oil supposed to be
264 2018-11-15 23:26:41 I want to make fun of you but it was an option i was considering. I have CBD oil but its not strong enough on its own. Plus vaping hurts less than smoking so hit me up with that "rig"
265 2018-11-15 23:26:36 Any of my #TwitterPeeps Kratom users? Trying something other than CBD oil to help my Anxiety, Depression, and Chronic Pain.
266 2018-11-15 23:26:19 Trump how do you feel about Lazy Lucic with 1 goal and 4 assists in 18 games, making 6 + million ??
267 2018-11-15 23:26:06 Oven fried chicken here, coconut oil, almond flour. Sides to be determined. Going to have to try your recipe.
268 2018-11-15 23:26:01 It’s like selling your oil rights circa 1920 for a flat fee.

273 2018-11-15 23:25:25 If you’re reading this don’t forget your car needs an oil change
274 2018-11-15 23:25:08 Thank you, Trump, for the good work on opening our oil markets.
275 2018-11-15 23:25:06 Trumps tough policies on the countries in the middle east are comming home to roost. Turkey have him by the balls. The isolation of Iran means if they isolates the saudis the oil prices will be anything. Trump has check mated himself. A total fool!
276 2018-11-15 23:25:05 Hi Craig. Please consider this. More and more electricity is being produced by renewable, Oregon is only 32% electric. from coal. Ethanol is a great source that is slowly progressing. All cars will hurt the environment. Can we agree that soon both will be better than drawing oil?
277 2018-11-15 23:25:04 just sniffed olbas oil so hard I think I’ve burnt a hole through my septum
278 2018-11-15 23:24:56 Are you taking CBD oil or have tried it?
279 2018-11-15 23:24:36 I know someone who was on the convoys. Torpedoed twice. 1st time irreparable heart damage 2nd time I of 7 survivors the others covered in oil burnt around them. He never left the Mental Hospital. In Wales, Whitchurch nor Cardiff if the man would like to see the facts.
280 2018-11-15 23:24:33 Yeah, there was nothing in the way of poppyseed oil so I’m just roughing it with liquin
281 2018-11-15 23:24:33 Getting people to realise that eating animals is killing our planet is the hardest issue. They are willing to cut out palm oil, shop for cruelty free cosmetics, but ask them to give up meat.....
282 2018-11-15 23:24:31 Stop considering that. Do a Cajun rub with a creole butter injection and fry that bird in OIL
283 2018-11-15 23:24:23 But that oil & gas caucus, no establishment Dems pushing back on that one!  Climate change will kill them, too.
284 2018-11-15 23:24:19 Our first car  (honeymoon car as well ) was a 1948 Plymouth. Cost 75 quid and sold 3 months later for 65. Saudis opened a new oil field to keep it suppled.
285 2018-11-15 23:24:07 “Maaaaybeee.” He turns his attention back to the eggs, scooping them out of the pan into a serving dish. Coating the pan with a drop of oil, he swirls the pan. Starts making pancakes. He adores that she said ‘we’. He smiles wistfully. They’ll make it work.
286 2018-11-15 23:24:05 They foolishly stopped paying into it years ago. Norway has $1trillion sovereign wealth fund from oil. More concerned with not paying sales tax.

289 2018-11-15 23:23:47 CBD oil isn’t legal in the UK, but we were prescribed Sileo Gel which works wonders for her! It has a short use by date once open, and it’s £30 a syringe so I wait until she hears one before dosing her. It settles her within 5/10 minutes so it’s really helped this year.
290 2018-11-15 23:23:46 Been acting odd lately da momma says, and hooman aunt Stacy den today I had a seizure. Da momma gib me hemp oil and I'm feeling better.
291 2018-11-15 23:23:44 But these same folks don’t concern themselves with tax subsidies for Amazon, oil companies, Walmart,
292 2018-11-15 23:23:41 Good quality leather shoes last me years unlike plastic ones that seem to last a short time & get thrown out & use oil resources. However, leather is a byproduct of some of the food I eat & I think it would be unwise not to use that.
293 2018-11-15 23:23:39 Someday soon Universities will do psychological studies on how almost half our citizens were brainwashed by a criminal snake oil salesman.
294 2018-11-15 23:23:36 Tea tree oil. Rub a few drops under your arms.
295 2018-11-15 23:23:32 How many people are Oil Companies paying to be skeptics?
How many people are being paid to study and report on the EFFECTS of Climate change?
No comparison.
296 2018-11-15 23:23:16 Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add garlic and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 1-2 minutes.Stir in chicken broth, milk, butter and fettuccine; season with salt and pepper, to taste. Cook the pasta, stir in Parmesan then add more milk
297 2018-11-15 23:23:00 CBD Oil Dabs... Or as I like to call them - Salad Dressing.
298 2018-11-15 23:22:57 1. Spending hours in the hairdressers
2. Wearing new socks
3. Being alone in the house with the music blaring
4. The smell of Bio Oil
5. Looking into the fridge just after you've cleaned it
299 2018-11-15 23:22:49 How do men on Twitter allow themselves to Clown Women for not getting oil changes and they don’t even know how to change oil 
300 2018-11-15 23:22:16 You’re such a snake oil salesman. You pick one thing that isn’t an actual democrat policy as evidence of voter fraud. If you look at actual democratic policies and you’ll see polling has them heavily favored.
301 2018-11-15 23:22:13 Guaranteed no oil spills.
302 2018-11-15 23:22:11 Apparently the carousel was out of oil or gas or something. Need better maintenance procedures looks like!
303 2018-11-15 23:21:59 So I figured out what’s causing me to break out and have random rashes and it’s my body wash that has soybean oil in it. Fml
304 2018-11-15 23:21:55 If you must have the text book example I suppose I can take the time to dig it up later.
However the two best examples I can think of from history are of the steel and oil industries. For steel this was accomplished by Andrew Carnegie, and for oil it was John D. Rockefeller
305 2018-11-15 23:21:52 I am suffocated and lost when I work, I get why it’s called ‘King of the olive oil baths.
306 2018-11-15 23:21:46 I tweeted to somebody who was sharing the #iceland advert. She bought her meat there... I politely pointed out animal agriculture destroys more rainforest that palm oil. She blocked me instantly! However, yesterday I did the same, and the person asked for more info!  Yes!!!!
307 2018-11-15 23:21:45 ขอบคุณมากค่าาาา 
308 2018-11-15 23:21:44 Let's think #Alberta.  What is important for AB and the #future of AB? Can we sustain an #oil based economy? What #rights matter?  Share your #opinion #futuregenerations hope we can make a difference...#climateaction #humanrights #education.  Want my #child to have a #future!
309 2018-11-15 23:21:44 Are there biscuits like Oreos which don’t contain palm oil? I need to find a replacement for my addiction... #vegan #PalmOilFree
310 2018-11-15 23:21:40 Oil who
311 2018-11-15 23:21:24 ถามจริง ถามจ
312 2018-11-15 23:21:16 He said ships were blown up. I knew someone who was torpedoed twice. 1st time caused irreparable heart damage. 2nd time 1 of seven survivors. The others burnt around him covered in oil. He died in a Mental Health Institution. Never recovered.
313 2018-11-15 23:21:16 Ok for the price point I really like Lush’s celestial. BUT- i will say that the oil cleansing method was the best and I wish I had kept it up
314 2018-11-15 23:21:11 I have a stye!!!  Trying to remember what I used to do, whenever either of my daughters had a stye.  I used to bathe their infected eye,  in hot,  salty water. It certainly helped.

What is a stye?  A stye, also known as a hordeolum, is a bacterial infection of an oil gland.
315 2018-11-15 23:21:11 Hate how the US can fuck up the CAD oil market that easy
316 2018-11-15 23:21:09 Lol, 100s of Billions have already been spent on Climate Research and MESSAGING. 10s of 1000s of people pay their mortgages and some are getting filthy rich @algore through Govt Grant's, subsidies, and ongoing funding.
Big Oil has spent maybe 1% of that.
317 2018-11-15 23:20:48 Good advice Old Snake Oil Salesman, why didn't you take it yourself ?
318 2018-11-15 23:20:44 Can't sleep? Use lavender essential oil in your bath. You will sleep like a baby.
319 2018-11-15 23:20:43 Wow hot oil just shot at my face, I think this is the universe tearing me down lmfaoooooo
320 2018-11-15 23:20:36 I had an oil leak in my car and I was really just driving that bitch like nothing was wrong lol I gotta do better
321 2018-11-15 23:20:32 Do you have oil?
322 2018-11-15 23:20:31 I came to my dads to get my rims changed and an oil change. But before coming I filled up my tank and now he’s using it to run his errands. 
323 2018-11-15 23:20:16 来ていいよ
324 2018-11-15 23:20:12 .. I hope someone's not depending on oil for heat ???
325 2018-11-15 23:19:59 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
326 2018-11-15 23:19:48 So my car started making noise out of nowhere and I call my step dad and he goes “When’s the last time you put oil in the car” and my dumb ass says “Like cooking oil?” That man hung up on me LMAO so I went to google and I see why he hung up 
327 2018-11-15 23:19:42 Did @JanaSenaParty leader ever questioned about money demonitisation benefit and gst taxes and oil taxes and necessary taxes that's heavy on common person with central? Did he know AP govt keep more taxes on oil prices? He came to ask questions? He is not able to ask govt? WHY??
328 2018-11-15 23:19:35 The LORD said to Moses,
"You shall command the
people of Israel that they
bring to you pure beaten
olive oil for the light,
that a lamp may regularly
be set up to burn.
In the tent of meeting,
outside the veil that's
before the testimony,
Aaron&his sons
shall tend it..."

Ex27:21
329 2018-11-15 23:19:30 After oppressing people of color for oil. We need to help find homes for everyone #NoBorders
330 2018-11-15 23:19:29 I felt that a lot of evidence suggested it wouldn't be achievable and that as a nation we were in a strong position within the EU and could have brought about change. But that's the thing about snake oil salesmen and women, they're very convincing
331 2018-11-15 23:19:26 You act like that's a bad thing. Would you rather destroy the economy, or the only planet we are able to live on? Would you rather be poor, or dead?

Besides, there are other ways to generate energy that don't require coal or oil.

333 2018-11-15 23:19:05 henlo miss "is that kris' face in a bottle of oil" taro
334 2018-11-15 23:19:03 @ipsyCare Can you filter your company/product preferences by whether they are vegan or contain palm oil or paraffin?
335 2018-11-15 23:18:28 Guess we better cancel all the oil etfs for when opec cuts production or the prez tweets about the SPR.
336 2018-11-15 23:18:22 Sorry bud, Africans have been way more advanced than what you're fed to believe. 

We have plenty resources and wonders. We actually don't need much from the other parts of the world.

We have gold, oil, diamonds, trees, wildlife labour and land(amongst a host of other minerals)
337 2018-11-15 23:18:21 ok this woman offered me her spare quart of 5W-30 even though my car takes 5W-20 and told me it doesn’t matter if you use 20 or 30. 

sure let me go ahead and fuck up my car when i haven’t even had it lifted to take a look at the oil pan that might be leaking
338 2018-11-15 23:18:18 you cannot drink or eat oil
339 2018-11-15 23:18:17 You need a spoonful of olive oil, lime, and salt.

342 2018-11-15 23:18:07 I hate that guy cause it’s so real! Snake oil sellers abound.
343 2018-11-15 23:18:03 Parboil potatoes before roasting & coat with olive oil to get them nice, tasty & crisp
344 2018-11-15 23:17:58 So I was told once that Ferrero uses "sustainable" palm oil for their products but doesn't advertise it cause it doesn't fit the line. They don't want to be perceived as "alternative". If it's true, then you'll have a good come back at him!
345 2018-11-15 23:17:41 Don't kid yourself, our oil isn't American enough for 'murica... They turn around and sell our oil with a 400% markup. :)
346 2018-11-15 23:17:29 Sitting in a chair at @JohnsHopkins surrounded by college students and I realize I am closer in age to the old guys in the oil paintings in the fancy little conference room in front of me than I am to them. #GetOffMyLawn #OldManThoughts
347 2018-11-15 23:17:19 Ako lang ba nakakapansin ng laging walang Chicken oil sa inasal nowadays 
348 2018-11-15 23:17:19 I never realised how many products have palm oil in it :(((((
349 2018-11-15 23:17:16 BRINE BRINE BRINE!!!!!! Then oil free fry it!!!
350 2018-11-15 23:16:56 True; but they're still the big kid on the block when it comes to Eastern and Northern Europe, and they've got the Germans and others enthralled for oil and gas, too.
351 2018-11-15 23:16:54 Did sweet you know what for me. Except give me a massive headache. Snake oil.
352 2018-11-15 23:16:53 oil pastels are the satan of art supplies
353 2018-11-15 23:16:29 Lol
How that side na 
Trust just dey paint everywhere red as you dey use red oil for the stew
354 2018-11-15 23:16:22 What matter is trade deficit. We had $17 Billion trade deficit while china had $35 trade surplus last month.
We are importing 83% oil and bankruptting ourself but other are trying hard for alternative???
355 2018-11-15 23:16:16 
356 2018-11-15 23:15:54 After they replaced the famous "cup and a half" of milk with palm oil ... and ruined the chocolate ... and the planet.   ...
All whilst enslaving children in Africa for the cocoa (along with most other big choc producers)
Buy #whitakerschocolate or other fair trade!!!!
357 2018-11-15 23:15:43 NSSJKSRHKEKAJSKWKW I HATE THIS
358 2018-11-15 23:15:21 That's a really funny way of saying that Trump's sanctions against Iran have completely failed such that Iran now:
1) Gets to build nukes with no restrictions;
2) Gets to sell their oil on world markets; and
3) Gets to keep the money we returned to secure the nuke deal.

Ugh.

360 2018-11-15 23:15:19 Yeah I want free oil subsidies, free bank bailouts, and free wars that never end. These people are beyond radical with their  crazy "spend it on education & healthcare instead" nonsense
361 2018-11-15 23:15:12 Ara sona Beds Are Burning - Midnight Oil
362 2018-11-15 23:15:00 Yessssss! Matt thinks I’m crazy haha I’m always bragging about how much I save. I got a glade oil plug-in for .25 a month ago!
363 2018-11-15 23:14:59 CBD oil is holistic bullshit, I took it for months and felt nothing except lighter in my wallet.
364 2018-11-15 23:14:49 In combination with this, inflation artificially increased stock prices, oil artificially withheld, too much tax money diverted to environ studies instead of infrastructure, corporations were allowed to purchase slave labor from foreign socialist markets, and bailouts.
365 2018-11-15 23:14:46 Lmao why are you trying to cook a 25 pound turkey in the microwave Kevin.....burn it to a crisp in hot oil while also setting your backyard on fire like the rest of us.
366 2018-11-15 23:14:33 Insha Allah
367 2018-11-15 23:14:32 Just heard a panicky story on @CBCWorldatSix about how we can't get oil to market fast enough and our economy is in trouble if we can't fix that.

Not a single mention of #climateChange and that we can't afford to burn that oil.

We've had decades to diversify and done nothing
368 2018-11-15 23:14:23 me: i don’t need to change my oil again i did it like 2 months ago in july
also me: commutes 300 miles a week, has no concept of time 
me: a dumbass
369 2018-11-15 23:14:23 I think a large supply of Ontario refined oil/gasoline is supplied from the US, so WCS price doesn't have much of an impact. WTI would likely have more of an impact (along with the exchange rate because the gas is imported).
370 2018-11-15 23:14:17 Gaussの法則から電荷求めても良かったかもな。表面積分してr→\infでも同じ答えでそう
371 2018-11-15 23:14:08 The irony is a paradigm shift would occur by switching to green energy and ending the need for oil.....the petro dollar would brake, FED quantitive easement would no longer be possible, hyper inflation would occur, and the world economy based on US dollar would collapse
372 2018-11-15 23:14:00 It took 2 hours to do a oil change  slow ass
373 2018-11-15 23:13:50 6 episodes isnt enough to continue my HBO subscription. You lost lifelong subscribers. I will buy on DVD. Way less profit then you had. Your greed terrible. The modern day Standard Oil. No supporting a monopoly here. Bye bye.

375 2018-11-15 23:13:44 Lord Lugard said "The North and the South of Nigeria are like oil and water, they will never mix". He amalgamated both regions in 1914.
376 2018-11-15 23:13:42 so your question above was just rhetorical - okay
Do you know what the Oil & gas industry gives to the govs in the form of inc, prop, royalties, pay taxes etc etc. - major $$ for govs-
It prob helps them fund green initiatives or social programs 
377 2018-11-15 23:13:39 Imma learn how to do oil changes so all the homegirls & girl cousins can come to me so they don’t get played for their money. Real tea.
378 2018-11-15 23:13:30 Finally made it to get my oil changed.  Can’t wait until my husband can do this for me! Lol. 
379 2018-11-15 23:13:29 You don't have to be very bright or even very Catholic to realise it's all a load of cobblers though. Cheap snake oil salesman!
380 2018-11-15 23:13:27 ... You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.
Surely goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the LORD forever. Psalm 23
381 2018-11-15 23:13:24 Wish I had a oil pen rn

384 2018-11-15 23:13:01 CBA: downgrade Brent oil prices by 14% to US$73/bbl in CY19 and by 2% to US$67/bbl in CY20. Stronger US production should keep WTI oil at a steep discount to Brent until later next year when infrastructure constraints ease #ausbiz #XJO #investing #crudeoil #energy #stocks
385 2018-11-15 23:13:01 standard oil and AT&T had less control and we broke them up- why not Amazon and Google
386 2018-11-15 23:13:01 Just to check, you can offer Christmas dinner, all the trimmings, cheese, crackers, booze, all the excess we have at that time of year, palm oil free? You have that now in your stores?
387 2018-11-15 23:12:34 A meal in 20 minutes! Ciabatta toasted with olive oil and pancetta mince. Serve with grilled fried eggs.
388 2018-11-15 23:12:23 It's reassuring that people are starting to care about responsible palm oil. It's just saddening that it's taken 10 years for it to seep into the public consciousness. I'd like to hope that one day, we eill be ahead of the curve.
389 2018-11-15 23:12:14 The legal oil shit they sell online
390 2018-11-15 23:12:08 Poor baby! Have you checked out CBD oil? It's supposed to be wonderful for dogs upset by fireworks and thunder.
391 2018-11-15 23:12:08 Oh it's there! Balsamic, olive oil, bit o' salt/pepper/sugar, and shallots.
392 2018-11-15 23:12:08 Argan oil is the only thing saving my skin rn! I’m an ashy mess
393 2018-11-15 23:12:07 The son of the vicar in our village went to Christ's Hospital School. His Mum was a portrait-painter & did an oil of him in uniform. White shirt & stock, dark-blue frock coat with leather belt outside, moleskin knee-breeches, yellow knee-length stockings and black buckle shoes.
394 2018-11-15 23:12:05 You’re a complete and utter shyster @RoryStewartUK you lied! Thank you @EmmaBarnett for picking that up and not letting him get away with more lies. Can’t we bring back public stocks for dealing with snake oil salesmen like this?
395 2018-11-15 23:11:55 @CIA I'm hearing good things, it pays to fight! We should NOT pay barbarians for oil, we take it!

These Arabs are institutionalized ISIS !
396 2018-11-15 23:11:43 Plus thousands of tons of detergent, mining tailings, motor oil, etc. draining every minute. We have turned our seas into toxic and garbage deposits... What are WE doing about it??
397 2018-11-15 23:11:41 I used to use jojoba oil.. it def worked for Me
398 2018-11-15 23:11:30 Interesting, I’m very unfamiliar with Oil painting. love that painting!
399 2018-11-15 23:11:26 You gonna buy the actual oil or bud type?

401 2018-11-15 23:10:52 #NorthDakota you REALLY are going to put an oil refinery 3 miles outside of Theodore Roosevelt National Park? ND’s top tourist destination? *Trying to wrap head around the foolishness of this decision* Is this stewardship?     @BrentSanfordND @DougBurgum #TRNP @betweenstories
402 2018-11-15 23:10:51 Our two faced government in Canada. Oil - bad $hit- good
403 2018-11-15 23:10:48 So now everybody hates palm oil. What did I miss?
404 2018-11-15 23:10:35 ねまぽや
405 2018-11-15 23:10:35 Then the organic certification bodies found out they're still mostly oil based plastic, polluting soils with micro plastics. They then removed them from "organic approved production" materials lists. Many farmers still have lots of that plastic in their soils from that period
406 2018-11-15 23:10:31 子猫なら…あっやっぱ無理っ(逃
407 2018-11-15 23:10:31 Should put something on the carpet! Hope that oil comes out. Good rescue!
408 2018-11-15 23:10:25 I can assure you there will be plans for intervening in selected areas and strategic resources, the first will be the usual 1) Ports 2) Oil rigs 3) Airports 4) Train stations/Depots all under the name of the civil contingency plan with willing assistance from local social clubs.

410 2018-11-15 23:10:19 High gloss varnish for oil paint :) !!
411 2018-11-15 23:10:18 Ya, unfortunately under NAFTA article 605 - we are REQUIRED to sell 74% of our oil to the US even if it leaves us short. In that case we then have to buy foreign oil to make up the shortfall. That's probably why you think the US is self sufficient. They get our Canadian oil cheap

414 2018-11-15 23:09:58 butter is better and it's not annoying to spread if you keep it in a butter dish at room temp
plus the "spreadable butter" you're referring to is butter mixed with canola oil, not margarine, which tastes awful
415 2018-11-15 23:09:45 Same garage that did the oil change?
416 2018-11-15 23:09:44 We hear you. This is a really important issue and we’ve been driving industry-wide change for more than 15 years.  We’re on track to meet our goal of sourcing 100% physically certified palm oil by the end of 2019.
417 2018-11-15 23:09:41 問題の作りと細かい設定がないせいで大学の教授ならこう考えて解いて欲しいんだろうなと予測して解かないといけないあたり物理は国語
418 2018-11-15 23:09:39 So where are the environmentalists?  Oh sorry it’s not oil so it’s not a problem
419 2018-11-15 23:09:20 Clean car, new battery, and an oil change.. what a productive day
420 2018-11-15 23:09:17 OK Ed - but if you want the progressives on board on this: Pelosi should STOP supporting the INSANE defense budget & STOP taking $ from big oil + support Medicare for All !!!! THIS IS ESSENTIAL !!!

423 2018-11-15 23:09:08 Hmmmm, what are your computer keys made of, Elvis? Or are you borrowing one? 50% of the volume of cars is plastic. So I assume you don't drive, or never use any oil based product in your life. Do you live in a cave?

425 2018-11-15 23:09:00 Intersting, especially since the major food industries in most countries tend to drive nutrition policy. (And of course we all know the pretend Med Diet is sponsored big time by the Italian olive oil industry).
426 2018-11-15 23:08:45 Listened to @SYSKPodcast ep on Pompeii as I walked through the ruins this week for the first time, then they released vomitiriums, then the pizza select, now olive oil?! HOW DID THEY KNOW I’M IN ITALY 
427 2018-11-15 23:08:45 You believe the Snake oil salesmen and other guff you deserve to be disappointed. Farage Gove Johnson and Mogg all full of rainbows and dreams ... but the reality is shit, risky and unsure #bbcqt
428 2018-11-15 23:08:31 Exactly. Prepare The Tower for guests and oil up the rack. Please tell me I didn't say that out loud?
429 2018-11-15 23:08:27 Bullish for oil as Saudis will set up Iran to spark war perhaps
430 2018-11-15 23:08:23 .@npr the voice of oil and gas

Zero investigative reporting, ever

Just switch that sh*t off
431 2018-11-15 23:08:19 Drugs mai jtna pesa hai utna oil mai b nahi, iraq ka oil or afghanistan k drugs chahye thy basically gooron ko.
432 2018-11-15 23:08:13 If only we'd given the entire region to Jordan like we were supposed to.
Though I guess that would complicate things now, having a massive unified oil superpower.
Saudi was our second biggest mistake after Pakistan.

This is a joke and a waste of time and money

438 2018-11-15 23:07:16 My husband and I have been married umpteen years. We have weathered several economic situations while running a small business for many years in Houston We are grateful at this time there is no recession, jobs are a plenty & oil prices are down. It makes for an excellent economy!
439 2018-11-15 23:06:58 I didn’t know you had to “season” a cast iron skillet with salt and then pour oil on it and bake it upside down like?? I didn’t ask for this
440 2018-11-15 23:06:54 I think all us English would agree that if Wales wants to go solo . Scotland is only of interest because of North sea oil. We're shooting ourselves in the foot, but you lot wouldn't even be able to afford a gun to do so.
441 2018-11-15 23:06:31 How's it inspiring? I'd like to think the @IcelandFoods one about palm oil that won't get aired is far more inspiring than this 
442 2018-11-15 23:06:26 Of course it wouldn't have anything to do with overfishing, would it? Seems like they're jumping on the anti oil bandwagon in hopes of cashing in. Wonder if they forgot how their boats get out to sea?
443 2018-11-15 23:06:13 If you have an eye dropper or an old nasal decongestant spray dispenser fill it with warm olive oil, put in ear leave for a couple of minutes or plug it up then empty your ear over the sink or into a towel then clean out with a tissue or cotton bud you can even use some warm h2o
444 2018-11-15 23:06:04 If it's scratchy, the thing to do is find a beard oil he likes. Then use it as an excuse to touch his face. 
445 2018-11-15 23:06:01 I would like to know who the majority of fleetcard holders including Govt are for re petrol  @acccgovau @pmc_gov_au . 
Yesterday @Coles petrol at Cammeray E10 was $1.64 yet @woolworths was Narrabeen was $1.28 . & BP express was $1.27 
What a ripoff #coles  #Auspol #oil
446 2018-11-15 23:06:01 Does it say "extra evil" on the label just like extra virgin olive oil? All extra evil is cold-pressed, which should go without saying.
447 2018-11-15 23:05:55 Cdn oil corps wants government to ensure prices? WT why not resurrect PetroCan?! So much for #market wisdom & #freedom ! Why didn’t the market build refining capacity ages ago? Now want big bad Gov to fix it huh
448 2018-11-15 23:05:54 Half these kids gonna be smoking blunts rolled in wax dipped in oil w THC levels to 50.+ by the time they graduate HS. Ya today’s is unhealthy af yo
449 2018-11-15 23:05:52 Palm oil is the worst!!
450 2018-11-15 23:05:52 Several Years ago, A oil refinery exploded about 30 or 40 miles from West London and it stunk over here for weeks.

452 2018-11-15 23:05:39 Hey the outerwear looks free of obvious oil/grease stains. That’s a win in my book.

455 2018-11-15 23:05:30 I don't have enough lubricant for the latter and I don't have enough olive oil for the former.
456 2018-11-15 23:05:21 講義ではそうなってましたのでそれでお願いします…＞＜
457 2018-11-15 23:05:16 My co workers think I'm a witch because I talk about making omega3 vitamins from mermaid oil and merjelly moisturizer. I also aspire to write a recipe book on the usage of ingredients from poached mythical creatures. That last bit will confirm me being a witch but an asshole one.
458 2018-11-15 23:04:58 TMPL will make a difference, but nowhere near what people are claiming the shortfall to be.  The US has increased its production, the mindset towards oil is changing, we have manufacturing plants in FM that cannot easily be throttled back and everyone knows it!
459 2018-11-15 23:04:56 If sauces correctly olive oil is not needed.
460 2018-11-15 23:04:42 Pembrokeshire. There was a famous oil spill there. And my accountant lives there. And Henry Tudor landed there on his way to Bosworth. That's mostly it.
461 2018-11-15 23:04:39 Covered in olive oil?
462 2018-11-15 23:04:33 Somebody I barely know: mentions any kind of skin problem

464 2018-11-15 23:04:25 UK department store...part of the "tradition" of Christmas commercials by big retailers. The one about the orangutan & palm oil which went around last week is another, except that it was banned for being "too political"...so it's viral now!
465 2018-11-15 23:04:25 Yeah you should! Maybe we should get someone to do an oil painting of us

470 2018-11-15 23:03:46 A thing about biodegradable plastics. In many there's only just enough corn based plastic in it to allow that component to break down "fast", leaving behind oil based plastics in micro fragments that take 1000s of years to break down
471 2018-11-15 23:03:36 White women throw those big ol bows on their baby head bc they don't what to do with that mixed hair..TAKE THE BOWS OFF and put some good oil & water on that hair!
472 2018-11-15 23:03:34 悪材料ばかり目がfocusされてますし、ここのところの全体の下げの恐怖も併せて売られ過ぎ感が否めないですが、MAX150$当たりまでの下げを織り込みつつ様子見しようとおもいます。先日はOilで痛めつけられまして頭冷やしに一人ディズニー(CA)してしまいました。
473 2018-11-15 23:03:20 Must be the oil stain
474 2018-11-15 23:03:08 No it is not. Soon or later Albertans will wake up and see how crooked your hiding taxes under those so call deals. #buildthedamnpipeline let Albertans go back to work.. stop importing Saudi Arabia’s oil. #solarenergy is not ready to replace #OilGadandCoal energies yet.

476 2018-11-15 23:03:00 If oil and natural gas are the lifeblood of the Texas economy, the almost 440,000 miles of pipelines are the critical veins and arteries that keep the Lone Star State's economy pumping. RETWEET if you support Texas pipelines!

478 2018-11-15 23:02:53 i’ve been waiting for my cars oil to be changed for 2 hours (they told me it’d be 45 minutes), they haven’t even started on it yet, and my back is killing me. 
479 2018-11-15 23:02:52 I used to have a Royal Enfield crusader. which was always leaking oil, at least it was getting a constant oil change.

486 2018-11-15 23:02:17 Me personally i dont like trump as a president he says stupid shit yes but he did save the oil and steel business in America and saved me from losing my job. All im saying is he was tweeting something for people who lost there life’s and thats still something to target him for
487 2018-11-15 23:02:07 Stupid question... the answer is obvious, protecting MBS at all costs is paramount.  KSA is a banana republic with oil... why would anyone really expect truth or justice?
488 2018-11-15 23:02:01 Ha ha , no oil painting
489 2018-11-15 23:01:49 the snake oil salesman SAID Aple should unplug the Internet but actually meant all Vulcans should all scream for ice cream!
490 2018-11-15 23:01:31 Don’t go to @jiffylube they’ll rip you off. They charged me for a full synthetic oil change when my car takes conventional oil. It’s a shame that places target women based on their belief that we know nothing about our cars. Go to #Merchants honest, straightforward business.
491 2018-11-15 23:01:00 Best meal plan -if anyone doesn't know where to start: Big bowl of Green Salads with 1 piece of grass fed meat and some coconut oil or ghee.

493 2018-11-15 23:00:57 Brilliantly stated & something @realDonaldTrump should respect but as everyone knows a Snake Oil Salesman selling their wares respects no one & his Snake Oil is full of Hatred, Racism & Division which has NEVER been something the UK has ever seen in USA. He has to go #JustSaying
494 2018-11-15 23:00:55 Yo my brother wants to be a mechanic and won’t change my oil. What kind of shit is that?
495 2018-11-15 23:00:52 I can’t dye my hair and I like it like this so I need someone to dye their hair like an oil spill. Send me pics after. I’ll be your biggest hype woman
496 2018-11-15 23:00:48 Olive oil and other cold-compressed organic oils, such as #hemp oil, are really good for the #liver. They help in providing a lipid base to the  liver that can suck up all the toxins and wastes from the body. This  takes some burden off the liver. #toronto #oakville

501 2018-11-15 23:00:32 Better use of our tax dollars than being in 7 or 8 wars for oil.

503 2018-11-15 23:00:21 @PnPCBC Canada's oil economy is in it's death throes . @cathmckenna can say she is ahead of herself!
504 2018-11-15 23:00:20 not only that but would big oil be on the hook for wrecking multiple states economies?
505 2018-11-15 23:00:19 I've been here waiting on my oil change for an hour and a half. Please free me.
506 2018-11-15 22:59:57 I can do with some Oil Down & Roti
507 2018-11-15 22:59:51 The #orangutans could be extinct within a generation >> destructive #palmoil companies like @Indofood are to blame. RT to tell members of palm oil certification org @RSPOtweets to commit to ‘No #Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation’ #RT16 #RSPO
508 2018-11-15 22:59:38 My beer is the same price it was before the election and gas prices are down because crude oil prices are down some 25%. All is not right in Ontario.
509 2018-11-15 22:59:31 Anybody else remove the sticker before getting their oil changed so that the mechanic doesn’t judge you for going over the mileage? #dontjudgeme
510 2018-11-15 22:59:30 Skinfood Black Sugar Perfect Cleansing Oil, & SNP Triple Water Deep Clean Facial Foam, or COSRX Low Ph Good Morning Gel Cleanser...(for now).
511 2018-11-15 22:59:14 Not true. The point was made that oil revenues are volatile. And straight after indyref1 the oil revenues dried up. And they are still very low. And they will never recover to previous highs.
512 2018-11-15 22:59:13 Oil would have to have ok to negotiate extension w Krieder beforehand.  Is in his prime and can skate and score.
513 2018-11-15 22:59:05 i can confirm linseed oil yellows but i can't get poppyseed oil here for some reason :/
514 2018-11-15 22:58:51 Today, I have been rewarded for my procrastination in vacuuming my car- this perk was included in my oil change and apparently it’s the little things that make the biggest difference.
515 2018-11-15 22:58:48 No kidding.
The Saudi oil keeps coming in on ships own by Liberal supporters, families, all tracing back to the PE Trudeau days....would be nice to see an expose on those shipping companies....
516 2018-11-15 22:58:36 And there it will sit collecting dust because as you quickly found out.  You need both the Senate and the President to pass legislation.  We deplorable love coal and love oil...so good luck on that one rookie
517 2018-11-15 22:58:28 If ECU was really interested in selling tickets this weekend......each fan or student should get a free turkey, some Cajun spice rub, some peanut oil and a flask of George Dickel............stock pot, burner and propane not included........that or a dunking booth with Cecil in it
518 2018-11-15 22:58:11 I just got new tires idk what he’s talking about  my car has been telling me I need an oil change for a month though 
519 2018-11-15 22:58:07 I put more olive oil on pasta than that just to loosen it up!

522 2018-11-15 22:58:00 I thin kthey more than got us back for that single vote that meant the difference by now , what with stealing oil and 6000 miles of sea , installing tories into westminster in 2016 and fucking up Holyrood with D'Hondt and introducing STV in councils.

Then theres brexit.
523 2018-11-15 22:57:43 When he prefers his asparagus with oil and salt but you've prepared it with butter...
524 2018-11-15 22:57:35 Since you made $122,850,000 in your career... Say half of that goes to Uncle Sam. That leaves you $61,425,000 left. At $25 per oil plus inflation, you can afford to live approximately another 2.1 million Thanksgiving’s. I think you should just go for it. Take a chance.
525 2018-11-15 22:57:26 According to a 2018 report by Gordon Laxter published by the Council of Canadians, NAFTA’s Article 605, energy proportionality rule ensures that Americans have "virtually unlimited first access to most of Canada’s oil and natural gas" and Canada cannot reduce oil, natural gas...
526 2018-11-15 22:57:08 I found an oil painting artist named Daria Callie and now I feel in my chest the need to start painting again.
527 2018-11-15 22:57:07 Palm Oil in general.   Don’t leave out all the large make-up companies!
528 2018-11-15 22:57:05 Rick Scott also looks like that guy from Midnight Oil.
529 2018-11-15 22:56:51 nah man there’s an oil stain on my ceiling from the last time i tried to use the stove i literally CANNOT do it
530 2018-11-15 22:56:41 Yeah....it's like cooking it without the oil. You're welcome.

536 2018-11-15 22:55:53 Depends on your skin type as to which is better. And if you’re wearing makeup you should be using both in your routine, an oil cleanser to remove makeup & your normal cleanser after.

538 2018-11-15 22:55:39 You are confusing club money v owners money. Not all clubs ruin by oil barons and Saudi prince's.

540 2018-11-15 22:55:26 山口達也いなくても超くさいですね
541 2018-11-15 22:55:25 Doesn’t this mean the market doesn’t value Canadian oil? Shouldn’t this mean Canadians ought to focus on a product with market value?
542 2018-11-15 22:55:22 For gods sake man, don't tell em we've got oil! I like having this roof over my head!!!
543 2018-11-15 22:55:15 @kaldrenon made me do this so I get to pretend I don’t enjoy this stuff

548 2018-11-15 22:54:33 If you wanted to stay with deep frying you can let the oil cool and then siphon it back into the jug
549 2018-11-15 22:54:31 Will there be Soap for men? Fresh cut Sawdust, pine tar, or any beard oil scent are good too.
550 2018-11-15 22:54:29 Yes I have a butterball electric fryer oil free. It works great and makes great gravy from the drippings. Much safer than oil frying and easier clean up. Home Depot for $100
551 2018-11-15 22:54:17 How many of your products don't have palm oil?
552 2018-11-15 22:54:14 buy @neutrogena over clean and clear, clearisil and cetaphil, they have a no deforestation/sustainable palm oil policy!!! Simple switches can make a big difference!
553 2018-11-15 22:54:08 Reminds me of a day on a Cretan farm, tasting their olive oils.  Only to hear the American ask where did the farm get the olives to make the oil.  Our Greek host and I shared a look as we stood in the olive grove.
554 2018-11-15 22:54:02 did you just tell that dude to rub oil on his cars windows?
555 2018-11-15 22:53:58 Confession: It has been 17 years since I last tasted Argan oil.
556 2018-11-15 22:53:47 A&M’s Trustees and Boosters are a Bunch Of Oil Barrons! They paid Sumlin’s exit fee without smirk, scowl or frown. $$ ain’t a problem in College Station Texas, believe Dat!
557 2018-11-15 22:53:41 Who in their right mind still pays any attention to this duplicitous conniving snake oil salesman ???!! You must be barking mad to still give your ear to any of this gaggle of extremist blowhards with no plan, useless and ultimately to blame for this brexshit shambles.
558 2018-11-15 22:53:41 Sad part is, it is going to take 3 to 5 years for that to happen. Alberta will still be paying on the potential of it's oil industry for years to come instead of on today's situation. Alberta separation is looking like a more possible option.

560 2018-11-15 22:53:23 If you squeeze a hash brown, would that make hash oil?
561 2018-11-15 22:53:21 Cool thing is, Nikola Motor will not only revolutionise Trucking, they will also grab a huge chunk of refuelling and #hydrogen infrastructure. Pushing big oil and big combustion. #OOTT
562 2018-11-15 22:53:10 The US Refiners have it in their best interest to keep these prices low ..  imagine if the next recession hits and oil $ can’t save the Canadian economy !!

565 2018-11-15 22:53:04 The National Sleep Foundation tells us to plan on replacing pillows every year or two. Why so often? Apparently they “absorb body oil, dead skin cells, and hair,” which can “create the perfect environment for dust mites (common allergens).”
566 2018-11-15 22:52:49 @DemolitionRanch use flex seal as oil in the Buick!!!!
567 2018-11-15 22:52:32 Me too just olive oil and anchovies.

570 2018-11-15 22:52:06 Palm oil certification body @RSPOtweets will only be credible if its #palmoil growers like @Indofood eradicate exploitation, deforestation & destruction of ecologically precious peatland from plantations. They must use this weeks’ P&C vote well! #RT16 #RSPO
571 2018-11-15 22:51:56 One guy said NG+10% oil -7% was just one "fund" getting out of position............ who are these people????? NG +20% then DOWN 20% since. Oil flat- wanting another 7%drop [my opinion]. But its all one fund moving the markets---
572 2018-11-15 22:51:55 No cars no oil..Think about Ontario...Great comments Michelle..I guess better oil in Saudi Arabia,Iran,Iraq
573 2018-11-15 22:51:44 To plump up lips, apply peppermint oil.
574 2018-11-15 22:51:42 Forget global warming. It’s the political corruption of the oil economy that should be driving us away from fossil fuels.

576 2018-11-15 22:51:32 To my friends on the oil rigs and ships around Newfoundland today, I wish you safe. This storm is crazy and has brought 80 foot waves to the shores.
577 2018-11-15 22:51:32 Bitcoin is a racket; not a market. Apple is over valued. Oil is in dramatic over supply. Next.
578 2018-11-15 22:51:29 WAY OVERRATED. I know a oil change coming next
579 2018-11-15 22:51:15 I have been hearing that oil is falling in ppb again because of Trumps exemptions..? And Saudi raised production on a “ promised” Iran sanction and now the market is glutted again Don’t know if all that jives or not

584 2018-11-15 22:50:47 Billions in oil and weapons deals.. You think they give a deep fried damn about morale? Fear of bone saw dismemberment while alive would keep me grinning from ear to ear.
585 2018-11-15 22:50:46 @penbo great analysis in today’s Advertiser, politics is so so fond Midnight Oil.... short memory must have a..... shoooort memory. Distracts from the real issues and we all suffer for it.

592 2018-11-15 22:49:31 It is pity that you don't know d meaning of decades. Decade means 10 years, so few decades is a minimum of 20 years & maximum of 60 years, since oil was discovered in 1956. But your post said $300b between 1999 and 2003. Guess u know the real Oponu and Eru. Stupidity personified

601 2018-11-15 22:48:27 do i know anyone who's used TransTape? do i really need their Removal Oil whatever or can i just use soap and water/coconut oil/other oil based something? and are the different tape sizes just depending on how big my tiddies are?
602 2018-11-15 22:48:23 Dejar de usar palm oil puede ser peor a la larga, es el aceite comestible más eficiente en el mercado ahorita. Si quisieramos usar otra X planta en su lugar habría que utilizar incluso más tierra. Sin embargo, no perdono la tala furtiva de tantas casitas de changos >:(
603 2018-11-15 22:48:23 Unlikely that will ever happen since you're not a doctor but a practitioner of "alternative medicine" that emphasizes manual readjustments, myofascial release, and other physical manipulation of muscle tissue and bones. So thankfully you don't sell your snake oil in ERs

609 2018-11-15 22:47:27 I hate when medication stops working. You build up that tolerance. Sometimes smoking is the only thing that helps me, but sometimes it can make me paranoid, too. I’ve been trying CBD oil lately and I can see a difference.

612 2018-11-15 22:47:11 This is pathetic but expected. They have no intention of letting us go until our resources, oil, fish and minerals are depleted.
So of course we are a Colonial region.
613 2018-11-15 22:47:09 So I woke up yesterday with a fever, put some thieves oil on my feet yesterday, diffused it while I slept, and then slathered some more on this morning before work and I don't have a fever anymore and I feel so much better. I'm so thankful for oils!

625 2018-11-15 22:46:03 I think you should direct this to the Useless Governor instead.... because he’s more closer to the people than Buhari is.. Buhari has too much on his plate and I won’t be surprised if he doesn’t know about the girls sef... Allah ya fito dasu.. it’s so sad

632 2018-11-15 22:44:51 I had a dream where I went to subway to order a pastrami melt on herbs & cheese, with spinach, olive oil, salt pepper parmesan, and provolone, toasted. Can someone interpret this for me?
633 2018-11-15 22:44:42 Koller Automotive in Bensalem is terrific. Left car there today for inspection and oil change and they gave us a discount coupon we didn't even know about. And with the snow and traffic issues, they said don't worry about paying til tomorrow.
634 2018-11-15 22:44:35 Oh no, I just learned most of what I know about oil paints from this older dutch guy who teaches oil painting classes to all of the old ladies who live here, and me. So his techiques were of the Old Masters whos main rule was to wait atleast 6-12 months before varnishing else it
635 2018-11-15 22:44:34 But...but...but...

It's all run out..England told us so in referendum.. and we have no more oil

Why would they say such fibs ?
636 2018-11-15 22:44:30 i rly bought oil paint without paint thinner huh lmao end me
637 2018-11-15 22:44:25 Unfortunately price will go up due to increase in cost of acrylic (oil). To offset price increase will offer discount for multiple stand purchase and a flat rate shipping option to US customers. Preorders will be listed soon.
638 2018-11-15 22:44:20 There are so many more problems than the color of our skin. There is a threat of mass starvation, massive floods, firestorms, genocides...all of it caused by fossil fuel usage. Fishermen are suing oil conglomerates for ruining their living. Their living is what goes on our table.

641 2018-11-15 22:44:08 People, slow down a bit, soon or later we will run out of oil, going green is not a bad idea it makes sense, but we won’t get there any time soon. We need to start transitioning at a slow and smart way. I would think we have about 30-40 years to go, maybe 
642 2018-11-15 22:43:58 Nails are my thing... not a guys smile or eyes. His hands and cuticles. Hubby is killing me!! I can't use my nail oil on him!! Bloody cuticles gross me out to the core.
643 2018-11-15 22:43:55 Gender bias maybe. Or maybe a dislike for old centrists holding the Democratic Party back by kneeling to big banks, dirty oil and other corporate interests?

647 2018-11-15 22:43:29 When deep frying oils, trans fats can be produced from the unsaturated fatty acids present in the oil. This effect can be reduced with the use of antioxidants, but will increase at higher temperatures of frying, and with longer times in that heat. #Tyagi #Food2150
648 2018-11-15 22:43:24 Your right, if not for Oil & Gas we would be like Kansas, Republicans don't want to deal with reality, they had nothing to do with price of Oil & the jobs related to it when it's above the 50 to 60 $ a barrel figure that make is profitable to drill. Renewables? They hold us back.

666 2018-11-15 22:41:44 @peter_levy fracking its a nimbies paradise ...do people think oil can be replaced to make things such as spectacles,cars,disability aids, clothes, kitchen compliments and everything we use everyday ....and if peeps want to reduce plastic look at powerhouse energy

673 2018-11-15 22:41:10 Which balm you using Robbie? I’ve started using the oil but suffer terribly my shoulder and elbow
674 2018-11-15 22:40:59 Yeah.... D-O-N-T!!  I have a $150 oil free flyer and does not work well. If it doesn’t work well on wings, chicken or fries even don’t attempt a big turkey. The regular turkey friers  work well as long as you don’t blow it up
675 2018-11-15 22:40:56 They’re really good! I sometimes just cut them up and bake them in the oven with a little olive oil. 
676 2018-11-15 22:40:50 Gaskia kam God will be the final for that man, and once again Allah ya isa for what he turned zamfara into. As for Buhari i hope he intervene and do something quickly aside the military base he built in the forest

679 2018-11-15 22:40:33 I hate when people try to sell me extra shit. Theres no way I need all this stuff done to my car when I bought it brand new a year ago. Just change my oil please.
680 2018-11-15 22:40:26 Why should Colorado adopt Low Emission Vehicle (LEV) standards? Because even according to @EPA the federal fuel efficiency rollback will:

> have Americans using 500,000 more oil barrels/day
> cost auto industry thousands of jobs

682 2018-11-15 22:40:18 Shetland want a UK with Scot in it. Nobody in Shetland has said they want to leave Scotland & be ruled directly from WM no matter how much PR since Crosland days has been attempted by WM to somehow suggest oil can be English. Seriously! The lines drawn on maps were fascinating
683 2018-11-15 22:40:15 Wrong wrong wrong.  Only specialty growers like corn chips, or soy oil.  The farmers get a premium and enter into a contract with companies like Frito lay.  Frito lay has a list of corn hybrids they want the farmer to plant
684 2018-11-15 22:40:14 Good for her! The USG is criminal in how it is approaching climate chaos and all the ecosystems and peoples affected by the oil barons greed. Dems have to change the game and kick the corrupters out of the legislative hallways. That's why she was elected. Pallone needs to listen.
685 2018-11-15 22:40:13 My dad is such a blessing. He took my car & got the oil changed, rotated my tires, cleaned it inside & out & filled my tank.  i feel loved.

692 2018-11-15 22:39:58 Then is this a reason to let these two die because they are Hausas?

695 2018-11-15 22:39:44 I hope you settle back ok after being off a while. Bet you will find it tiring at first..you have done very well.
696 2018-11-15 22:39:43 Someone once told me that under NAFTA rules, Canada must sell 75% of the oil it produces to the US at reduced prices. Even if we need to buy foreign oil to make up the shortfall if any in our own country. Can anybody confirm that is true? Stop buying foreign oil.

707 2018-11-15 22:38:32 Hhahahaa okay now. It's oil and gas sector shaa. I will tell her to let me know when there's an opening
708 2018-11-15 22:38:28 Red oil
709 2018-11-15 22:38:17 Yes. I highly recommend studded tires over non studded. Also try to size up tire if rim will handle it (eg 700x28 to 700x32) oil/grease everything liberally and frequently. Be prepared for inevitable cable/derailleur seizure.
710 2018-11-15 22:38:05 I don't even have words to describe Yari. But understand that a president can pressure a governor to do the right thing.
Yari God will be the final judge that's the only thing I can say him.
711 2018-11-15 22:38:02 Norway saved their oil revenues and have a massive fund, we spent ours
712 2018-11-15 22:37:56 anyone have the answers to my homework Engine oil (Cp = 2100 J/kgK) is to be heated from 20◦C to 60◦C at a rate of 30kg/s in a 2-cm-diameter thin-walled copper tube by condensing steam on the outside of the tube at a temperature of 130◦C (hf g = 2174 kJ/kg).

717 2018-11-15 22:37:15 LOVED this! great helpful tips forsure! im going to try the lipstick and castor oil tip 
718 2018-11-15 22:37:10 Fake. Phony. Disingenuous. Get the idea? We pump oil by millions of barrels down St. Lawrence. Saudis laughing their guts out at Canada. Same power wimped out of political and economic necessity for Energy East. And you posture on this? Take THAT to CDN doors on campaign 2019.
719 2018-11-15 22:37:08 I make my own with coconut oil and baking soda & I add lavender, frankincense & bergamont oil for a pretty smell.

722 2018-11-15 22:36:51 Do y'all still clean your stomachs kaCastor oil just for control?
723 2018-11-15 22:36:46 I’m a Pipefitter, mainly spent my career in the oil and gas industry on sites such as LOR and ConocoPhillips but recently I’ve been working in food factories and small biogas sites.
724 2018-11-15 22:36:33 Good lord you're willfully ignorant. A normal wood-burning stove can hit ~1110 F, and Aluminum melts at ~1220 F. A forest fire with the addition of burning gas, oil and rubber can easily reach such temperatures. The Great Fire in London hit over 3000 F, for example. 1/
725 2018-11-15 22:36:32 Thing is, you guys were so dependent on heating oil, and still are. Last year those dopes in Mass. had to import Russian gas due to their stopping pipelines being built to pipe in super cheap Marcellus gas not 300 miles away.
726 2018-11-15 22:36:29 And whose this fire fighter who says this?
I've seen concrete damaged by intense fire,.. damaging asphalt, which is made with HEAT, and can BURN, since it's made of OIL  is nothing to a high heat forest fire
727 2018-11-15 22:36:23 Just saved $15 on my oil change and I’m so grateful for it because I dont get the cheap ones 
728 2018-11-15 22:36:20 We did oooo by the way back to work next week after my lower back procedure and my right knee replacement atb to temple towers

730 2018-11-15 22:36:12 Do you just use like jojoba, sunflower, etc oils or are there like special oil cleansers you buy??
731 2018-11-15 22:36:06 When hauwa was killed did you see any stupid activist or can member say something? Because they're Sentimental about the whole issue religiously.
732 2018-11-15 22:36:05 And then his grandfather made mega bucks in the gas station business. He's happy to live off that money while destroying everyones life who might also want to make money off oil and gas.
733 2018-11-15 22:36:02 Co-worker: be careful while cleaning this, cuz all the edges are serrated, hot, and covered in oil and grease.
Me: oh, are there gloves I should wear so I don't cut myself?
Co-worker: nope, we all just grab it with our bare hands and quickly throw it in the sink.
Me: ...ok then.
734 2018-11-15 22:36:00 @elonmusk spotted a Tesla Model X in Maine today with the license plate “LOL OIL”

Then four new tires nex week 
741 2018-11-15 22:35:19 I've watched the #IcelandChristmasAdvert so many times now and it breaks my heart everytime. I'm starting the habit of checking labels and I'm shocked to see so many products we use day in day out containing Palm Oil!!
742 2018-11-15 22:35:16 I loved it when they brought it up because my roommate was insistent on the quality of their olive oil despite being oldddd
743 2018-11-15 22:35:11 water, not stove or drier yet. have a line from road so don't have to ever worry about refilling the tank, which is nice. alot quieter than oil furnace too. heat more consistent, not the cycle of gong off until it gets cold then furnace fires.
744 2018-11-15 22:35:09 Brazy that it’s the blacks in this oil industry that hate on each other, while every other race look out and show love for their own.... we gotta do bettter !

751 2018-11-15 22:34:07 I began by giving you the benefit of doubt. However, that was wrong just as I was wrong to be discussing the oncoming ice age in the early 70s.
Now that you've betrayed yourself by resorting to the alarmist claims of oil funding & other nonsense, you obviously have nothing.
752 2018-11-15 22:34:06 Right. Cause oil from countries that won't let their women be educated, drive cars, etc., is so much better.
753 2018-11-15 22:34:05 I picked up new polish, mink oil, + a little cleaning brush today + boy I can't tell you how excited I am to polish my boots tonight.
754 2018-11-15 22:34:04 That’s a shame. A steak cooked right is awesome. Everyone try this and come back and like my comment.

3. Cook
755 2018-11-15 22:33:54 Mustapha what happened to Leah Sharibu made pple saying all sort of words towards Buhari saying if she was a Hausa girl he would have saved her and then from no where Hauwa Liman was killed
756 2018-11-15 22:33:32 You know better ai.... And you know when senator marafa came out and talk about the situation. Hypothetically zamfara people are not politically educated
757 2018-11-15 22:33:31 This is great Alecia! I've been working on my pine cones - making my own scented ones, instead of buying them. But its' been challenging, I think I need the essential oil to spray on them. Great blog!!
758 2018-11-15 22:33:29 It is not all about this shity Oil...outside...too short term thinking...
759 2018-11-15 22:33:21 Always remember to take off make up before bed. Try and wash your face after taking it off and putting on a night serum. Argan oil night serum seems to be one the best I've used so far.

761 2018-11-15 22:33:16 Maybe @RachelNotley needs to stop transfer payments until we get a reasonable price for our oil, the only way this will change is if Quebec feels the pain.
762 2018-11-15 22:33:11 how much palm oil is in this product?
763 2018-11-15 22:33:07 Gonna need more of an oil tanker terminal than a port to be honest.
764 2018-11-15 22:32:51 Et ? Tu connais l'impact du carburant sur une charge de taxi? Ce que représente le gas oil pour un agricuteur? Et la manière dont ils défiscalisent   ?  On reconnait les cons à ce qu'ils s'expriment sur tout ce qu'ils ignorent , blaireau  !
765 2018-11-15 22:32:48 @cvpayne Interesting cnbc article saying Trump 'hoodwinked' Saudis to oversupply oil market and cause 25% drop in prices. Uri Geller watch out!  There's a new sheriff in town.
766 2018-11-15 22:32:47 Took my car to get an oil change and they even washed it for me

770 2018-11-15 22:32:33 Don't Dodge my first question. About El-rufa'i he did great but in a situation whereby a governor dodge his responsibility will the president just fold his hands and let the masses to their fate?
771 2018-11-15 22:32:33 looks good and now I'm gonna try makin' it this year, but personally my favorite way of cooking mushrooms is sauteed or oven roasted with olive oil and red skin potatoes

Oil change 
Gonna pick up @BunnieMAR from work and have a sit down , yaaass

773 2018-11-15 22:32:20 Answers the door in a three-piece suit, tie and pocket handkerchief, looking as if he stepped out of an oil painting. "You came. I'm a little surprised."
774 2018-11-15 22:32:19 Just a guy wearing his Aus Music Tshirt to work - nothing to see here. This must have been during the Midnight Oil/Reg Mombassa collaboration era?

The bad news: IT TAKES FOR-FRIGGEN-EVER TO USE THESE PROPERLY. AAAAA.
780 2018-11-15 22:31:59 So, to be clear, this is the price Eastern Canadians are happy to pay as long as they don’t have to have anything to do with AB’s icky $12.00 oil? Gotcha. We may actually be the stupidest, most self-loathing nation on the planet.

789 2018-11-15 22:31:39 That doesn’t mean you can sell the oil rites
790 2018-11-15 22:31:39 No, understand the point saving them is imminent. Should have been a priority for the president to layoff, but the duty of the governor is not bestowed on the president likewise all other elected politicians. They all have one or two things mandatorily.
791 2018-11-15 22:31:37 False news from POTUS again. Just to divide and put oil on fire. @realDonaldTrump, is this caps-lock of fear? Check your facts before post anything from your sh*thole!
792 2018-11-15 22:31:27 Why is my man teaching me how to change the oil on a car, I’m almost 7 months pregnant lol this isn’t necessary right now 
793 2018-11-15 22:31:26 The fact that this isn’t the primary home jersey is a tragedy. The Oil blue is *maybe* the nicest in the NHL, and the orange is ... well let’s just say it’s a third jersey.
794 2018-11-15 22:31:25 Oh but I do. It is my belief that my opponent has absolutely 0 research on the subject and simply asserts that it is because they have oil.
795 2018-11-15 22:31:24 @IcelandFoods How many own brand products contain palm oil & what is the % of this for your entire own brand range? Think the ad & cause is fab. Just curious.

799 2018-11-15 22:30:58 Hmm! Bali, and the Maldives will probably be underwater before long, it’s too fricking cold in Iceland (Palm Oil free own products though) and there are things in Africa that could/would kill/eat you.... I’m thinking New Zealand

815 2018-11-15 22:30:21 time to go away
816 2018-11-15 22:30:21 You should stop using palm oil altogether.
817 2018-11-15 22:30:16 Huh?  Last month the puts on oil went from $0.01 to $5.  That’s more return than anyone made long oil from $26 drop to $75 in two years.....  one month drop ....

829 2018-11-15 22:27:57 Besides let me ask you, why did we all applaud governor el-rufai for standing firm for the people of kaduna state? Why didn't we call for the president's intervention?
830 2018-11-15 22:27:41 Celery and cheese spread!!! Or super easy fave: baguette slices lightly toasted with olive oil and with a slice of pear, crumble of Gorgonzola, touch of honey. Also still delicious if you skip the pear.
831 2018-11-15 22:27:40 Tbh I don’t think pushing to lower the demand of palm oil is gonna be affective at all. I think we need some good ol’ Government Regulation
832 2018-11-15 22:27:39 Is the wild growth oil worth buying?

848 2018-11-15 22:25:57 Listening to this oil furnace chugging away. I seriously have to upgrade to an efficient wall-mounted electric heater for this room.
849 2018-11-15 22:25:48 Well it is a matter of time people will develop the crave to know what exactly is happening around them...then they might have a clear picture and that is when politicians will be answerable to the masses

Electrify or spray heavy oil on the fence to prevent illegals from fence climbing and charge Velenzela for the labor/cost of doing it!
851 2018-11-15 22:25:42 Attention Rex Manning fans, to your left you will notice a shoplifter being chased by night manager, Lucas. This young man will be caught, deep fried in a vat of hot oil and served to our first hundred customers. Just another tasty treat from the gang at Empire Records.
852 2018-11-15 22:25:37 They also refuse to believe they are contributing to deforestation.  Where do all these folks think the land is coming from from to grow their food and vegan shampoo?  CLEARED FORESTS.  Palm oil from Indonesia is killing thousands of orangutans every year.

857 2018-11-15 22:24:50 How they managed to get into this situation.. yikes. Going to be interesting to see how they restructure that club especially with two stars signed long-term while they potentially go through a rebuild. When LA turns it around, those guys might be at the end of their primes.
858 2018-11-15 22:24:49 I want the oil 
859 2018-11-15 22:24:48 It is but where is the first contact?
860 2018-11-15 22:24:47 Ive been oil cleansing and doing the 60 second cleansing method for a while now and my skin feels sooooo softtt.

864 2018-11-15 22:24:38 I can’t wait to bath oil ,stand in the sun so i take a picture with hashtag sunkissed
865 2018-11-15 22:24:37 I'm on a palm oil diet. It's hard as most foods have it in. I am going to be writing to Carburys etc and ask why on earth they need to put this poison in their products!!
866 2018-11-15 22:24:26 When they killed Buharin Daji (the villian that started all this) inlaw to the incumbent governor, why didn't you cry out loud for intervention? I think you people should start reasoning beyond politics

869 2018-11-15 22:24:18 Yea! Actually if you look on their website they have something crazy like 40 different ways you can use it! I use it as an oil moisturizer so to speak at the end of my routine and under my eyes to soften my bags

873 2018-11-15 22:23:59 Help put an end to #palmoil rainforest destruction > RT to tell @RSPOtweets to vote to strengthen palm oil industry standards #RSPO #RT16
874 2018-11-15 22:23:57 so if trump hadn't pulled out of the iran deal, he wouldnt lean on saudi's for oil shock protection, and wouldn't be in this mess.  also, after moving embassy to jerusalem, why still cling to middle east peace hope?
875 2018-11-15 22:23:56 Perhaps if you supported Canadian oil producers clean oil, you could save enough from paying for dirty oil to fix your systems and not pollute the environment with your sewage.

878 2018-11-15 22:23:21 Make sure your beard oil is organic, artisanal and from so@e tree no one has ever heard of but it’s harvested sustainably
879 2018-11-15 22:23:19 It doesn't appear that you are getting the job done. Not one single pipeline is proceeding and it won't be starting for a very long time. Just because you are arguing that you are working hard doesn't equate to pipe in the ground, jobs in the field and oil flowing to new markets.
880 2018-11-15 22:23:04 There's honestly no excuse for Trump. 
He's an oil spill in the ocean. 
His hatefulness and negativity is toxic for the American soul.
He doesn't nearly love our country as much as he mistakenly loves himself. 
Mirror him at your own risk.

883 2018-11-15 22:22:50 People need to know, no palm oil, we don’t need it
884 2018-11-15 22:22:41 good luck with that...
885 2018-11-15 22:22:39 Agreed on all, but would add that it is not just government that has been played - Canadian business have as well. Blocking Canadian oil from markets - domestic and international - is making others rich at our expense.
886 2018-11-15 22:22:31 @7007matt commented on what a barrel of oil costs. 
@7007matt predicted the future price of what a barrel of oil costs and was wrong. 
@7007matt doesnt know what gasoline is made of! LOL

That Boy @7007matt sure is stupid.
887 2018-11-15 22:22:11 I needed to put transmission fluid in there & my dumb ass dad said he “ Knew how to do it “ so i let him & the retard put it in my fucking oil

893 2018-11-15 22:21:58 Good day today, I was waiting for an oil change and decided to circle the #Abbotsford Automall today to get contact information from all the dealerships. I think it would be interesting to see how business is doing and see if there are ways to improve. I will follow up and see.

895 2018-11-15 22:21:46 Or fan them. With oil
896 2018-11-15 22:21:44 Are you saying this is not a national issue?
897 2018-11-15 22:21:38 Politics aside, when Boko haram started the police and the Governor where massively blamed later on the then Yaradua admin. But in the case of kidnapping chain of command from local to the central government who is closest to intervene? When will Nigerians stop blaming the centr?
898 2018-11-15 22:21:32 Correct. So when the pound crashes, oil to us is more expensive. The pound has crashed because of the uncertainty caused by this chaotic Brexit process.
899 2018-11-15 22:21:29 If you really cared that much surely you would stop stocking other products that contain palm oil? Feel this advert is just a virtue signalling money making tactic before Christmas. Palm oil if regulated and ethically sourced is one of the least detrimental options for the planet
900 2018-11-15 22:21:09 I think it is a positive decision made by Calgary! They asked for the opinions of the locals so it is only fair to respect those wishes. 
It has also been an economically tough few years for Calgary due to the low oil prices so hosting such a large event would only cost them more
901 2018-11-15 22:21:08 It would be genius on his part to pull this off.  Of course nothing would make me happier than to watch this sleezebag crash and burn if he did hit the woman.

903 2018-11-15 22:20:56 Hey, how about you stop cutting down rain forests, and cut down on your use of palm oil instead??? That's a much better Christmas present for everyone.
904 2018-11-15 22:20:46 Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it upon his head, and kissed him, and said, Is it not because the LORD hath anointed thee to be captain over his inheritance?
905 2018-11-15 22:20:42 At this damn tire place waiting for them to Change my tire .. come with me to get a oil change
906 2018-11-15 22:20:40 Great message, no palm oil, we don’t need it...
907 2018-11-15 22:20:37 What does oil do? fuels cars, trucks, trains, ships & aircraft, which transport us and everything we use to make life better, including food.
It's used to make medicine, medical equipment/devices, toiletries, electronics, clothing, sun/glasses, fertilizer, paint, soap, houses...
908 2018-11-15 22:20:35 Bring some oil over here

After my massage all slathered in oil, I looked so sexy in the steam room 

Dripping wet
913 2018-11-15 22:19:39 Don't be surprised if Avenatti set this up. Think of it. All of a sudden the whole world is against him, then miraculously he is exonerated and continues to be hailed as a champion for women.  His popularity would skyrocket.  He needs it to jump ahead of politicians in Prez race.
914 2018-11-15 22:19:37 I think most of the money is made on tail risk derivatives. Think back to $75 oil last month....We can go to $26 again. We can also go to $150 next year. All depends on what Saudis and their friend in China want. Don’t think for a second Saudis have Trumps back.
915 2018-11-15 22:19:25 palm oil way
916 2018-11-15 22:19:25 Did you people give excuses to the previous administrations the way you are excusing Buhari? If these girls died wlh Allah will ask Buhari and he will be accountable for the amanah that Allah bestowed upon him. If the security chiefs are incompetent who brought them?
917 2018-11-15 22:19:20 Most of the prepared dressings in the stores around here contain soya bean oil which my body does not react well to so I tend to stick with oil & vinegar or lemon these days.

925 2018-11-15 22:18:58 The year is 2938, the world has been ravaged by global warming and people have been forced underground to hide from the oil raiders. The static of a radio begins to become clear as a radio announcer declares 'Veronica Mars' is coming back to TV

930 2018-11-15 22:18:20 Pollution rises from smoke stacks that are directly related to the oil and gas industries, not at the end of shit filled pipelines.
931 2018-11-15 22:18:04 What Trump does that I disagree with, is far outweighed by what I agree with.
History will remember him as a carnival barker who was a great & effective POTUS.
Unlike his smooth talking,  snake oil salesman predecessor.
932 2018-11-15 22:18:03 採用してから厳選だと余計なコストがかかるんだよなあ
933 2018-11-15 22:17:49 Oh dear...that's not good Arthur! Ukip ! Brexit is ridiculous! We are a tiny country in a world of superpowers. To stay with Europe as peak oil collides with climate breakdown & environmental collapse is far better than being alone. In Europe we have Allies & good regulations!
934 2018-11-15 22:17:33 Silence is golden with no palm oil
935 2018-11-15 22:17:28 Tony (Ottawa Punter ) does one every year! It’s amazing! Get a Big Easy oil less fryer! THE BEST! 
936 2018-11-15 22:17:25 This was predicted. In absolute desperation, Cenovus and other energy producers are asking for the Canadian taps to be closed while China and Quebec are buying millions of Barrels of oil daily at world prices. The Canadian Government is the laughing stock of the world.
937 2018-11-15 22:17:14 Coconut oil smells so good mmmmhhhhmmmm awe yissss
938 2018-11-15 22:17:10 @RosieBarton #question4@issuepanel #Thenational i am watch huge oil trains go by from my kitchen window, didn’t the PM buy us pipeline?
939 2018-11-15 22:17:09 We don’t need their oil. We not only have enough here but we have enough to export in large quantities.  This has to do with DJT’s & Kushy’s personal finances. They’re both in their pockets.

947 2018-11-15 22:16:17 So do nothing then? We need to save what rain forest is left. People don't need to eat Palm oil.
948 2018-11-15 22:15:55 What does central Canadian arrogance exactly means Michelle?
The good doctor's argument is on developing  green economy & not have Calgary not depend on oil sector so greatly. Such divisive rhetoric is unproductive.

BTW you & @jkenney were lamenting the stagnating oil economy
949 2018-11-15 22:15:55 дааа
и охранники такие в мыслях типа бляя да когда ты уже уйдешь и я смогу тогда
но вообще я ещё боюсь что меня закроют в зале если я одна в зале
950 2018-11-15 22:15:42 Als je werkt bij de EU Palm Oil Alliance kan je ook moeilijk anders zeggen,... 
951 2018-11-15 22:15:39 Ive never had CBD oil ever work for me, but these seem to help a bit.
952 2018-11-15 22:15:31 I just dropped a bottle of gardenia perfume oil... It did not survive
953 2018-11-15 22:15:29 I don't care what you look like or what you do (I'm no oil painting and I'm a Civil Servant after all...) but don't lie before we've even met.....
954 2018-11-15 22:15:25 Dear Iceland - do you support Brexit? Asking as someone who has campaigned against palm oil for many years.
955 2018-11-15 22:15:18 Not one word. Didn't check back to see if I got the oil, didn't even say anything when he DIED! Please know you don't exist in my world anymore.
956 2018-11-15 22:15:07 न none, अमृष्ट: unclean (cleansed without applying oil before bath), न none, नानुलिप्ताङ्ग: without having his limbs anointed,
957 2018-11-15 22:14:58 I agree with @DavisReaLtd, Canada needs a Strategic Petroleum Reserve.  Government should buy oil from Canadian firms at $45bbl.  Do if for national security.  Take millions of barrels out of the market. @WBrettWilson @levinepmc @DavidBaskinBWM
958 2018-11-15 22:14:56 So you are saying he cleaned every object in garage and put the dirt and dust back and old oil stains back. Threw some shell casings around for good measure. Popped to IKEA and got a nice new bed. Cleaned his bedroom better than any professional then just left a key laying about
959 2018-11-15 22:14:54 I did it for a good 2 months before I fell off cus we were moving, but I def seen a difference with my brows & lashes! I Mix it with aloe so the black caster oil isn’t to harsh on my skin 
960 2018-11-15 22:14:49 Cook some salmon in avocado oil. That usually helps me
961 2018-11-15 22:14:40 i love that one, or if 'you all want to protest big oil so much, how did you get here? did you DRIVE?
962 2018-11-15 22:14:37 Oil just popped an hit me in the eye, pimp in distress, man down. All is lost
963 2018-11-15 22:14:33 Is fuel really mixing with oil, in the 1.5 litre turbocharged engine?
964 2018-11-15 22:14:19 Islam di sluruh dunia sama bro. Di timur tengan bnyk negara2 islam di provokoasi dgn teroris untuk tujuan kekuasaan & oil. Isis buatan amerika & negara2 sekutu untuk mengivasi suria, irak & negara2 islam yg tdk mau berkompromi dgn kekuasan . Siapa korban isis? Umat islam
965 2018-11-15 22:14:16 Translation: you oil cheap now, we buy all.  bring own workers you move shit out..chop chop?
966 2018-11-15 22:14:06 Capacity utilization benchmarks in industry rarely go up into 95th percentile. KinderMorgan cap utiliz goal is around 95%. Children are not crude oil. Classrooms are not pipelines. Oil does not have special needs, bullies, joy to dance out, bad day to release, family to support.
967 2018-11-15 22:13:58 Hi Tommy, our header has rear wheel assist with chaff cart, what is the nightmare with hydraulics? Hydraulic oil does overheat on warm days like yesterday. Is that what your referring to?
968 2018-11-15 22:13:51 @IbeKachikwu is the best Nigeria have ever had as a minister.... no matter what he made d difference in oil sector in d past three year no matter who face is there........ He is a Nigerian #Kachukwu2019. Crucify me.@FMPRng @NNPCgroup @MBuhari please let applaud him he gas tried.
969 2018-11-15 22:13:39 This girl literally just put olive oil on her legs like it’s lotion.
970 2018-11-15 22:13:23 I used to always see my family checking the oil in their car & putting water in it. Idek how to open the hood of my car so hopefully I’m straight
971 2018-11-15 22:13:13 I read that Conservatives do not have a lot of PUBIC relations. It is hard for them to date and such because they are shady con artists, snake oil salesmen that use religion and patriotism to hustle their wares.
972 2018-11-15 22:13:09 Got you..but like full details coz m in
973 2018-11-15 22:13:04 Also can I remind her that under Heath ration cards was issued for fuel bus to the 70s oil crisis
974 2018-11-15 22:13:04 HAHAHA basically you just get garlic, shallots and bombay, dried chillies and udang kering, add small amt of water and blend all of these  then in a pot just add plenty of oil and wait until the oil is hot enough and pour the mixture in. then add salt, sugar and ajinamoto hehe
975 2018-11-15 22:13:00 If the State governor failed in his duties it is an excuse for the president to let them die without doing anything about the matter? Or the presidency isn't aware of the situation?
976 2018-11-15 22:12:59 quick poll: should people who still haven't sussed that Tony Blair is a lying amoral gobshite who started the Iraq oil massacre to make a shedload of money still be allowed to wear long trousers/the female adult equivalent?
977 2018-11-15 22:12:59 Bro, aku bolak bakek ke US, kerja di US oil & gas company terbesar dunia. Sering meeting dg orang2 GOI; bhs Inggris mereka dg logat Jawa dan grammar mungkin gak lulus TOEFL, tapi mereka smart dan mampu bernegosiasi (tdk hanya komunikasi) dg orang2 US. Trus apa masalahnya?
978 2018-11-15 22:12:57 リクエストは受け付けないぜ！
979 2018-11-15 22:12:55 Huh? 
Define “low grade” oil.
980 2018-11-15 22:12:40 Where’s the oil and salt
981 2018-11-15 22:12:40 The problem with that deep "analysis" is that Boris Johnson is a screamingly obvious grifter; liar; snake oil sales person; three card monte dealer; scoundrel and venal bandit who'd have the pennies from a dead man's eyes.
982 2018-11-15 22:12:28 

People think because Rick Perry is from an oil producing state that he was a good pick for Department of energy, they don't realize the department of Energy's main job is overseeing all of the United States nuclear Arsenal

FRIGHTENING!!!
983 2018-11-15 22:12:26 Glad to accommodate Heidi ;)
984 2018-11-15 22:12:16 うろむさんゆゆゆゆ！！
985 2018-11-15 22:12:05 It’s sickening that Trump and so many others in the USA government consider Saudi Arabia to be a critically important ally.   Why?  Right, oil.
986 2018-11-15 22:11:51 Russia and America should cut off oil supplies immediately
987 2018-11-15 22:11:43 D’you know who his followers are ?
988 2018-11-15 22:11:43 idk why people are so quick to say that there are more efficient ways of helping the earth than by not not buying products with palm oil in. surely if you truly want to help the earth, you’d be happy with even small changes in people’s thought processes
989 2018-11-15 22:11:38 #Oil #OOTT #WTI
The cold spell has brought outdoor temperature below freezing point. I was surprised to see the first snowfall this afternoon when taking a break from trading. Cold weather boosts the prices of #naturalgas and heating oil as well.
990 2018-11-15 22:11:38 Odd this never came up under Nats despite. Collins, Bennett, Brownlee Finlayson breaking laws, Bridges not knowing he was signing over a doc park to oil drillinf and Woodhouse
991 2018-11-15 22:11:33 I've used peppermint oil before
992 2018-11-15 22:11:28 8 hrs power off, heat off. In Lawrence MA many after 8 weeks without house warming! MA dependence on gas is insane insecure indefinitely-forestalling action to replace combustion boilers for electricity - heating. Tiny progress on #sunwindwater because lifestyle needs gas&oil....
993 2018-11-15 22:11:26 I would recommend my Shea Butter or my Coconut Oil.
994 2018-11-15 22:11:12 You can't oil her??? I wouldn't know, I'm not far enough in that game!
995 2018-11-15 22:11:09 Browsing through catalogues & came across this little gem: 'Duncan Grant, lover of Rogered  Bell, father to Vanessa, oil on canvas, Trees in a Desert' I suspect a rogue employee or someone with a healthy sense of humour
996 2018-11-15 22:11:08 Well after a long and successful career in oil or nuclear you can probably afford to be! 
997 2018-11-15 22:10:55 Watching The Lorax makes me think... is Palm Oil our Thneed?
998 2018-11-15 22:10:51 The tub of @Benecol spread in my fridge lists Palm Oil as one of its ingredients. Can you tell me if this comes from a sustainable source?
999 2018-11-15 22:10:47 It’s @JODYHiGHROLLER with the motor oil
1000 2018-11-15 22:10:32 The price of oil probably got hit harder than it should have but remember the 4th quarter demand is seasonally weak unless we have a warm winter. Heating is not a big demand for oil. The main use for oil is to produce gasoline and diesel for transportation. #oil #crude #petroleum

1004 2018-11-15 22:10:11 Oh you guys and gals love to tease us about Coda. A cheeky little reference in the FAQ right there. Do you think you might be sneaking us an early Xmas present or a 2019 release? (We have pitchforks ready for the invasion and hope you don’t have the vats of boiling oil)
1005 2018-11-15 22:10:03 君を笑わせるためなら、僕は尻から油を出すよ。
1006 2018-11-15 22:09:55 Try the big easy and you’ll never go back to peanut oil. It’s just so much easier and cheaper and the finished product is better we think. Do brine though.
1007 2018-11-15 22:09:53 Hey don't knock "red meat, oil and heterosexual sex".
Mind you it's bloody painful if you get them mixed up.
1008 2018-11-15 22:09:48 Save the #orangutans! For its NEW set of principles & criteria, I want global #palmoil body @RSPOtweets to vote for ‘No #Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation’ in palm oil, and to hold members like @Indofood to account #RT16 #RSPO

1010 2018-11-15 22:09:32 @AsimSupreme  Do you have something for us to regularly oil our whole bodies?
1011 2018-11-15 22:09:26 Recipe of borsch:
1. Boil the broth with bay leaf.
2. Cook the beets with the peel, cool, peel and grate.
3. Peel carrots and onions. Grate carrots, chop onions. Vegetables (carrots, onions and beets) fry in sunflower oil with the addition of tomato paste.
1012 2018-11-15 22:09:09 Crunchy tofu is my favorite, who knew that olive oil, soy sauce and balsamic vinegar would make it so tasty 
1013 2018-11-15 22:09:05 Heavens won’t be smiling for long if we don’t invest in electric cars and charging infrastructure. We can’t keep buying oil for ever
1014 2018-11-15 22:08:48 Beto really took my car changed my oil, filled my tires with air, washed my whole car, put gas in it, and left me a lil cute ass note... I don’t like to brag but man I really got blessed with this man 
1015 2018-11-15 22:08:43 Yet you’re subscribing to an alternative that mainly benefits a minimum population of oil, gas & coal magnates. That’s how they get you: they project what they’re doing onto the leaders of the alternatives. We’re eating most of the costs while they can afford to move and recover.
1016 2018-11-15 22:08:40 This is a matter of national security CinC is expected to intervene.
State of emergency wasn't declared when Chibok girls were abducted and the presidency intervene in the matter. It's the same case with Liah Sharibu. I stand to be corrected.
1017 2018-11-15 22:08:39 Dame ya boys gettin thick, now I look like an oil field asshole when I’m in my boots smh
1018 2018-11-15 22:08:30 Did you kind of put a lot more oil in that then was needed to make a point?
1019 2018-11-15 22:08:18 @robotviking just finished the olive oil podcast. Nice work!
1020 2018-11-15 22:08:11 I can see it. Franzen's just so ... oil company villain instead of Dr. Seuss villain, though. Like, his very existence is so overwhelmingly frustrating, I can't enjoy my fury.
1021 2018-11-15 22:08:11 Does Buhari taking the oath to safeguard the lives of Nigerians has to do with him Personally watching over us in the name of protecting our lives and properties?he channels his authority downwards to the officials under him whom together they run the affairs of the state
1022 2018-11-15 22:08:08 And I'm using peanut oil
1023 2018-11-15 22:08:03 Yes it was the olive oil one and the one that comes in the clear tub eco styler is the worst
1024 2018-11-15 22:08:03 Bodi in oil down oui

1026 2018-11-15 22:07:59 Ive never disappointed my dad as  much as when he checked my oil
1027 2018-11-15 22:07:54 Really wish I knew anything about cars so I wouldn’t get completely finessed when getting my oil changed
1028 2018-11-15 22:07:43 Climate-fueled #CaliforniaFires are a symptom of a fossil fuel industry that is destructive to our health, our climate, our political system & our way of life in CA. We have protected the oil industry for too long; it's time we held them accountable. @GavinNewsom @MaryNicholsCA
1029 2018-11-15 22:07:29 No, ban gas and oil we need clean energy, solar, wind, electric, wave power. Dont shoot the messanger!

1035 2018-11-15 22:06:29 so where do I fill my lawnmower up with geothermal hotness.. You know oil and natural gas is also RIGHT BELOW OUR FEET.
1036 2018-11-15 22:06:24 Thank you, PG&E.

They have been burning the midnight oil with Gov. Jerry Brown to get him to sign a limit of their liability in two of the state’s worst fires, one lat year that wiped out Napa, Sonoma, and Mendocino wine-growing, and this year’s Camp Fire.

1044 2018-11-15 22:05:36 RT to pressure @RSPOtweets, the #palmoil industry's self-proclaimed regulator to protect the #planet, #animals and #workers from destructive palm oil companies. It’s time it updated its rules to make palm oil truly sustainable #RSPO #RT16
1045 2018-11-15 22:05:33 *caveat* the crust must have that garlicky oil on it, then it's exceptional
1046 2018-11-15 22:05:33 Is it hard to stay in the saddle with that much oil?
1047 2018-11-15 22:05:24 You know you can freeze the oil and reuse it, right?
1048 2018-11-15 22:05:22 Tell her to use Tea tree oil every night and wash her face with bar soap

1053 2018-11-15 22:05:03 Miracles only worked 2000 years ago...and I don't belive them. Perhaps a concatenation of circumstances involving a little spilt oil resulting in a change of direction...
1054 2018-11-15 22:04:55 is it just me or do y’all love it whenever you just got a fresh set and they put the oil around your cuticles and rub it on your whole hand

1058 2018-11-15 22:04:29 Oil prices selling lower
1059 2018-11-15 22:04:22 These can be the days now. Speak out about the government's insane plans to look for more oil and gas. Use your platform to speak truth to power.
1060 2018-11-15 22:04:17 XRT, XHB,SMH,crude oil, all blowing up at same time, market internals saying Fed is clueless on strength of economy looking forward.
1061 2018-11-15 22:04:10 Big Oil worked for years to prevent us from learning their findings about climate change. 

Big Data will work for years to ensure we do not regulate how they handle and use that data. They'll put on a nice show, but they aren't good guys.
1062 2018-11-15 22:03:48 There’s a beer called Neck Oil perhaps we should get some of that!
1063 2018-11-15 22:03:17 The issue of boko haram is a national issue which later even became a transnational disaster and at such the overall high ranking officer has to take the lead....blame Buhari if u want to but blame him in a reasonable way
1064 2018-11-15 22:03:03 How many orangutans die from the deforestation to create the palm oil plantations for your cappuccino?
1065 2018-11-15 22:03:01 That’s a lot of fancy stuff. Buy some oil and make some brownies. Smoking it is terrible.

1069 2018-11-15 22:02:44 Makes sense. Seems like a business opportunity, Joe. UBER but for huge jugs of oil to deep fry stuff.
1070 2018-11-15 22:02:40 Actually, oil companies "face some of the biggest challenges to reach the goals of the #ParisAgreement."

1074 2018-11-15 22:02:14 Deep fried. Keep the oil for use during bowl season. Large batches of chicken wings and blooming onions. It is usually cool enough for the oil to last a month after first use (in the colder climates).
1075 2018-11-15 22:02:09 I don't doubt it. Lots of local conservation volunteers I worked with were previously employed in the Purbeck oil and nuclear industries. But would you pet a leprous squirrel?

1081 2018-11-15 22:01:36 the palm oil campaign has achieved nothing Band Aid has achieved nothing so if they come up with something that they don't want to be achieved it might work

1085 2018-11-15 22:01:21 And I say that knowing full well I'm no oil painting
1086 2018-11-15 22:01:09 24 wallet-years worth of oil.
1087 2018-11-15 22:01:01 I live 2.5 hours away and am real close to doing the same.  Not sure if I want to make that drive 8 sundays of the year, but damn I love being in Lucas Oil.

1095 2018-11-15 22:00:10 Cooking oil dissolves the glue.  I know from experience
1096 2018-11-15 22:00:09 I don't eat half them things in that pot but every time I see that oil down I get real hungry
1097 2018-11-15 22:00:07 November 15, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.

1099 2018-11-15 21:59:56 Come on out to Arizona. I’ll hide you in an oil drum in a ditch in my backyard. I’ll dump in a box of scorpions and a couple of rattlers to keep you company.
1100 2018-11-15 21:59:53 Oh yeah I could do with one of those too...though I would prefer black please.
1101 2018-11-15 21:59:52 I’ll bring the wine. And the massage oil.
1102 2018-11-15 21:59:48 Try some tea tree oil  it’s about $2 at target

1104 2018-11-15 21:59:41 The moment you substantiate your claim that 'cause oil' is the legal justification for sanctions, or the real reason. That's how this works.
1105 2018-11-15 21:59:40 When you go to Philly, do you order a cheesesteak with no bun? When you go to NY, do you order gluten free pizza? Of course not, get you some oil and fry the bird...it’s thanksgiving for gods sake
1106 2018-11-15 21:59:33 Let them sell their expensive cars, wine, cheeses, olive oil etc.  somewhere else then - while we enjoy eating our own, or world food.
1107 2018-11-15 21:59:29 They simply have to move off oil. There is no alternative.
1108 2018-11-15 21:59:17 A 2016 study estimated that Canada spends $3.3 billion a year on fossil fuel subsidies, including $1.2 billion in favourable federal tax treatment of oil and gas extraction and development projects.

1116 2018-11-15 21:58:21 Oil and gas is thriving all over, with the exception of failed states and war zones. And Alberta. That's the company or world class industry is in these days because of the total mess this government's made of the energy file.
1117 2018-11-15 21:58:06 Dear President Trump.  Let the media file all the motions they want.  Simply don't allow them to ask questions. These news firms profit by making you look bad. Have Sarah Sanders simply read the briefing without questions. You can tweet straight to the people. @realDonaldTrump
1118 2018-11-15 21:57:53 If nothing else, I am on this planet to send strongly worded emails to NPR like today's, where I refer to Jim Jordan and Steve King's ideas as little more than "praying to the Constitution that God refills the world's oil reserves and anoints the world with a golden handgun."
1119 2018-11-15 21:57:45 Which one? I had used the one with olive oil and it works decently( my hair gets flaky on my edges/baby hair and it broke my forehead out ). Eco styler does flake 
1120 2018-11-15 21:57:43 I'm not paying for oil. I buy some gasoline for my car and it comes from a refinery near Edmonton most likely. No new pipeline will help my prices but a new refinery would.

1123 2018-11-15 21:57:28 It was a solid tweet and I enjoyed it however much a little voice within me protests against its use of the trope that the oil we pump is from dinosaurs instead of older vegetable matter. After all, It's not like the obnoxious narrator character would be expected to get it right!
1124 2018-11-15 21:57:12 Agriculture is the coolest thing you can think about. Nobody drinks oil but everybody eats food...In agriculture,I believe that Africa can industrialize...

1126 2018-11-15 21:56:54 hmmm...money as a commodity. I don't see that. At least I don't see it in terms of a commodity like soy, oil, cocoa, coffee, etc. I'm a reasonably bright guy but how is money like a commodity the market can provide w/o a manager (eg, Fed) or tying it TO A COMMODITY (eg Gold)?
1127 2018-11-15 21:56:22 $GE is the domino. Then oil debt. Then high yield $HYG. On top of that you got algos trading against algos all with massive tail risk.  
1128 2018-11-15 21:56:19 And I didn’t push it cause I thought well if I can barely handle taking a tablespoon or two of liquid iron what would that big amount all do at once lol. And it’s like that with caffeine, cbd oil, And some other stuff I’ve become so intolerant to it’s so bizarre. Even Novocain!
1129 2018-11-15 21:56:16 Chris’s dads truck had an oil leak. He ignored it for about two years. You good bro. Send it
1130 2018-11-15 21:56:08 Told mom I was getting an oil change, brakes checked, and tires checked before I come down so dad has nothing to say about my car

1132 2018-11-15 21:55:44 Why the fuck can’t I steal the oil wagons on read dead 
1133 2018-11-15 21:55:40 CBD oil is what I use. It’s helped me so much!
1134 2018-11-15 21:55:37 I betcha, the use of anointing oil, and funerary rites, was the colour of the Myrrh made things look fresh.
Pinked up, the blue, cold, pale, hand of death.
1135 2018-11-15 21:55:31 Anyone have any experience cooking turkeys with the oil free fryers? I’m doing the turkeys this year and was considering that method after years of deep frying.
1136 2018-11-15 21:55:30 Unprofitable mining gigs. Could get squeezed. Check out what happened with oil between 2014 and 2016. The big boys stayed. The rest were either liquidated or forced to adapt. Survival of the fittest. Without a positive demand shock (e.g. institutional money) the supply side is F.
1137 2018-11-15 21:55:23 ! More like it!
1138 2018-11-15 21:55:19 Fatty though , I’d have to reduce the oil
1139 2018-11-15 21:55:18 Alright I need to stop procrastinating and get some oil brush cleaner
1140 2018-11-15 21:55:15 Try CBC oil. It’s available at health food stores. The best one I know isSource. It’s expensive but has worked well relieving injury caused depression in two people I know. Really effective. Good luck.
1141 2018-11-15 21:55:06 Man if I pull into auto zone I can get my oil changed w out an appointment shit I think

1146 2018-11-15 21:54:51 Hopefully this pie does not contain PALM OIL like a lot of your other ready made pies do. Disgusting that you use this product. When do you plan to remove this from all your products ??
1147 2018-11-15 21:54:44 Santos, hello. I want to honor you with love. You are a genius to the science. I have come from a family of doctors. I was not indoctrinated, that allowed my medical wired mind to see openly. I know scientifically on how we achieve Christ consciousness. The chrism oil.
1148 2018-11-15 21:54:32 Why does the gov try so hard to find oil when it’s all on my face 
1149 2018-11-15 21:54:21 I don't think I can eat Chinese food anymore because gutter oil is a thing. Thanks @andymilonakis 
1150 2018-11-15 21:54:16 The first thing I do when I meet a woman is agrue.

So far I have about two who come back for more.

Next?

Convince me that men aren't less disposable than women! Why else would we send them to war, the sewers, the mines, and the oil rigs?

Lol.
1151 2018-11-15 21:53:59 可愛そうじゃないぃ……
1152 2018-11-15 21:53:52 Your doing a great job Bill. We bring in a big carbon tax and they don't. We can export 18$ oil and a bunch of jobs and make enough off carbon tax we don't need to work. Win/win
1153 2018-11-15 21:53:46 I’d really like @AldiUK to use sustainable palm oil.
1154 2018-11-15 21:53:43 girl try some jojoba oil at night! Works wonder for dry skin
1155 2018-11-15 21:53:20 Hi guys. Any British short track oval racers taking part this year?
1156 2018-11-15 21:53:13 4) Stay hydrated! Be sure to drink plenty of water to avoid dehydration
5) Gently exfoliate! Apply a gentle exfoliator like a sugar scrub.
6) Moisturizer! Coconut oil, coca butter can help
1157 2018-11-15 21:53:12 Do you know that many substances from Nutella to many hair conditioner contain palm oil taken from creatures homes. Please try and look for daily products that don’t contain these things to support the stop of this disgusting plague taken on by the world 
1158 2018-11-15 21:53:04 I'm not a businessman or an accountant. Just cant believe that similar sized countries such as Norway or Ireland are doing just fine with nowhere near the resources we have. We won't need London's pocket money if we can sell our own oil, gas, whisky, gin, farming, fishing etc!
1159 2018-11-15 21:52:48 Now now people. Innocent until proven guilty. Kavanaugh. The oil will come to the surface w this scumsucker. Just b cool

1161 2018-11-15 21:52:45 So he should be the first to mention when something happened in an autonomous state with a sitting governor, pls state of emergency is not declared yet in that state
1162 2018-11-15 21:52:41 I'm confused. Greenpeace's business model is based on burning more oil?
1163 2018-11-15 21:52:36 Weiss with @BP_Alaska: "Volatile" is the word of the day as it relates to oil prices. We still see opportunities in Alaska at a variety of oil prices. Competition is key, goal is #40more years at Prudhoe Bay. #akrdc2018
1164 2018-11-15 21:52:21 My partner had a huge one when we just met. She had to stop eating chicken (because of the hormones), junk food and other things. Also, she did what we all the 'castor oil' treatment. Even though she had to do a surgery...diet adjustment is essential.
1165 2018-11-15 21:52:10 look at her tummy 
1166 2018-11-15 21:52:08 Get an air fryer. Uses way less oil, fries plantain evenly, and doesn't leave your whole kitchen smelling of the stuff so you can fry in stealth mode.
1167 2018-11-15 21:52:08 最低よwwwwwwwww
1168 2018-11-15 21:52:02 Our oil is a national commodity or perhaps you didn’t notice the transfer payments that you receive.
1169 2018-11-15 21:51:59 North America’s dirtiest oil comes from the Placerita oil fields outside Los Angeles. The “dirtiest” oil comes fro Africa.
1170 2018-11-15 21:51:57 The 90 dollar facial oil I got from Sephora just came in the mail... this shit better make my face look flawless
1171 2018-11-15 21:51:48 Sometimes I think my life sucks, but then I remember people in the south still pay $25 for an 8th & $20 for a gram of oil
1172 2018-11-15 21:51:39 You in SF? Go to 'FlowertothePeople and ask for oil that is 50%CBD 50%THC. Won't make you high if properly dosed. But if you drink a decent amount, go a couple weeks without alchohol and see what it does. Often that is a cause. Wrecks havoc on sleep neurology but can heal.
1173 2018-11-15 21:51:39 Im sad I recently checked @Target brand of peanut butter (which I always get) and they use palm oil :( time to switch brands!
1174 2018-11-15 21:51:29 They know that Nigeria is about to collapse so they are looting the treasury dry to leave the country broke as she dies slowly. All the fund they borrowed from China they used oil blocs in the Niger-Delta as collateral exempting the North from the debt.
1175 2018-11-15 21:51:24 When pouring the alcohol it's important to do it carefully, otherwise it can cross the oil and mix with water
1176 2018-11-15 21:51:22 the canada strike workers really don't give up, its snowing and they're still on the picket line huddled around a makeshift oil drum fire.....
1177 2018-11-15 21:51:07 So two things to try

First is salt water nasal rinse - kits at any drug store Walmart

Second heat a large bowl of water in microwave then add 3-4 drops of a quality Eucalyptus oil CVS etc

Then with a towel over your head lean over bowl and breathe deep

Hope u feel better
1178 2018-11-15 21:51:04 Kevin’s log: shirt on while cooking with oil.
1179 2018-11-15 21:50:55 Osteopath worked for me but of course it doesn’t for everyone- it’s very personal. Hope pain management can help, although they haven’t helped Suzie with her pain. She’s had lidocaine and ketamine injections. She’s been referred again to see if cannabis oil works xxxx
1180 2018-11-15 21:50:50 Not from oil production.
Leprosy has an unwarranted fear factor associated same as many of the 200 types of cancer.
Conifers were the preferred choice, same as colour of the plant. I did calculations of fence/plant to trees for fire radiation spacing - both ways. Trees worse fire
1181 2018-11-15 21:50:43 Automated rigs are prohibitively expensive and purpose built for oil sands pad work. There is no replacement for the mobile service rig, but new tech is mostly rigless. The surplus workers in the rig fleet have followed the technology to frac crews, wireline and well testing.
1182 2018-11-15 21:50:21 It’s fuckin pathetic man. For that reason I take them the oil I use. I took them two 5 quart jugs and they put both in and over filled the shit out of engine that could’ve fucked it up on the drive down to TX. Plus spilled oil all over my engine filling it...smfh.
1183 2018-11-15 21:50:18 Gold. Oil. Soy. Corn. Commodities all provided by the market. You may want to regulated the market more than me, but I assume you don't think gov't should provide these things?
1184 2018-11-15 21:50:17 Rain Man had a much better grip on reality. Rainmaker was the snake oil salesman .
1185 2018-11-15 21:50:14 Washed the dishes, cleaned a toilet, stressed about rent, held his child (male), peeled garlic, exercised, listened, changed the oil in his automobile, tipped the server accordingly, changed a soiled nappy, commute to work during rush hour
1186 2018-11-15 21:50:13 So djt went to France to honor American troops who died defending freedom, but decided not to show up. Are there any veterans who find this outrageous? Some of you voted for this snake oil salesman, but it's not too late. You'll have another swing at it, get it right this time.
1187 2018-11-15 21:50:09 There seems to be contradictory info on which companies use the sustainable palm oil - it’s really hard to know what to believe - thank you for trying to help me.
1188 2018-11-15 21:50:07 I hope the ad person behind the Iceland Palm Oil campaign got a promotion. Feels like Kony 2012 all over again.
1189 2018-11-15 21:50:05 If they were so concerned about spills you think they would want to replace that aging line that is in the ground moving oil through the community’s and Forests to something more advanced and modern. Just sayin

1191 2018-11-15 21:49:58 Here is another one that was quite good for 5-6 years old, the three levels of unmixable liquids: add food colour to alcohol and water. Then fill a cup with water, then oil and then alcohol

1197 2018-11-15 21:49:39 @LFRS_Central @LeicsFireRescue it's nice to see how not to handle hot oil fires #student tour demo never try it at home always leave to professional firefighters seeing that shows it can be dangerous #not just fires @LFRSWestern

1199 2018-11-15 21:49:07 This year I started tracking my calories and exercising. At first, I just changed my eating habits. Not eating much fast food, cooking with olive oil instead of butter, wheat or whole grain pasta. I switched to diet soda until I was able to only drink water without headaches.
1200 2018-11-15 21:49:04 I still have a Midnight Oil shirt from a show in 1985. They opened for UB40 & were the better act that night

1210 2018-11-15 21:47:17 Which is exactly why she should step aside and stop going to oil and gas fundraising events.
1211 2018-11-15 21:47:03 53.50 next level down if current bear flag not denied. In coming weeks refiners will snap up oil after their maintenance shutdowns over and start winter blends. Above 58.35ish I'm more constructive long, nothing is settled yet. More to it but this is one tweet. Grizz will inform
1212 2018-11-15 21:46:54 "You know what this toast needs?"
"What?"
"Cow juice oil, mixed with an unsprouted plant."

And this is how garlic bread was invented.

1225 2018-11-15 21:45:48 #Tyagi found that when frying soybean oil and frying time and temperature increases, the amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids increases in direct proportion.

1228 2018-11-15 21:45:39 When you lather up in lotion/oil and then later for the cold winter, you basically broil yourself and your layers is the oven lol
1229 2018-11-15 21:45:35 Seriously???  You need to get your facts straight. Saudi oil is being imported into Ontario and Quebec everyday. The oil that you get via the us is discounted from Alberta so you may get Alberta oil but it’s discounted to the US then resold back to Canada at a premium.
1230 2018-11-15 21:45:34 I agree. Kemboy further boosted the JLT form when winning the Clonmel Oil Chase today.

1233 2018-11-15 21:45:16 Got high before my oil change. 
1234 2018-11-15 21:45:15 It is because Onne port is for only oil and gas import/export terminal, there is a monopoly on the ports.
1235 2018-11-15 21:45:12 Why is @Chevron the last Big Oil company still funding anti-climate ALEC to do its dirty work peddling disinformation? It’s time to drop ALEC [link to graphic]

1237 2018-11-15 21:45:06 As an industry we promote the positives we do, but at the same time we don’t feel it’s right to discredit others. 30% of rainforests are destroyed for Palm Oil,yet it seems acceptable another 60% is used for soya! #vegansdestroyingtheplanet

1242 2018-11-15 21:44:34 That policy has an origin. In one man's head. That he introduced to an organization. That introduced it to the right people that would incorporate the policy so they could use it to strike (OIL) Operation Iraqi Liberation. It was an executive order war not voted on by Congress.

1249 2018-11-15 21:43:58 I'm not talking about current levels, more about how in the 80s the Tories spent the oil & gas windfall on tax cuts vs the Norwegians setting up the (soon to be) biggest sovereign wealth fund in the world. Risk & reward cuts both ways!

1252 2018-11-15 21:43:43 Oil check came back clean..
1253 2018-11-15 21:43:36 Lobbying for a cap-and-trade system with a very low price in carbon would allow Big Oil to present itself as properly regulated when it’s really anything but.  

You fell for corporate propaganda.

1255 2018-11-15 21:43:17 Yes, the Left want our oil left in the ground and import our needs from Saudi Arabia and other Mid East countries to be delivered by tankers. What a bunch of arrogant elitist hypocritical bozos.

1257 2018-11-15 21:43:01 The huge problem is that regulations are used to protect businesses -- from upstart (and in this case cleaner) companies and from extreme liability. Example - without the federal government, no insurance company in the world would underwrite a policy for an offshore oil platform

1265 2018-11-15 21:42:18 Senator, instead of complaining & twitting, tell us what you recommend and the pros/cons of your recommendations. Keep in mind SA controls much of the oil market, something we & the rest of the world depend on, so we don’t want to bankrupt economies around the globe.
1266 2018-11-15 21:42:13 Why do you think oil can’t go lower?  The OVIX went much higher from the Iran deal....100 year crisis events  occur a lot more often than market prices them in.
1267 2018-11-15 21:42:05 Did you even read the remaining convo we had with person who tweeted it? Dont come with your little wa’azi here.
1268 2018-11-15 21:42:00 Honestly it's because they have the largest proven oil reserves in the world. It's sad but true. Just think what the oil market would be live if an Iranian type government had the oil.

1272 2018-11-15 21:41:25 Yep. An accident without multiple safety systems. Just imagine if any other industry dumped pollutants into a river because a pipe cracked. 

Environmentalists get up in arms when oil leaks at a valve where the leak is contained within the containment system in place.

1274 2018-11-15 21:41:24 Norwegian here and Joshua hit the nail on head as we say here. But we have some money for our defens (even if half of it is wasted on stuff that don't work properly). High taxes, OIL, low pop and intergating immigrants means better coperation and high income for state and people.
1275 2018-11-15 21:40:55 The pipeline and oil transport vessels are high risk for environmental disasters.   Say no for the pipeline.

1317 2018-11-15 21:37:13 If your argument is true why are the BC government, natives and so many others concerned about spills. They really need to talk to you so we can get oil to the BC coast and get a fair price for Alberta oil. We are currently selling oil at a ridiculous discount
1318 2018-11-15 21:37:07 my point was that conflating everything as "fish oil" is bringing in everyone's biases + other data, when the fact of a different mixture of molecules in a different formulation at a different dose is a *very* reasonable explanation for why a drug would work or not
1319 2018-11-15 21:36:51 The guy who’s doing my oil change saw me grab the caguama in my car and put it in my trunk

1329 2018-11-15 21:36:03 Economy going down the pan (I remember it well). Never mind, we'll soon be back to those good old days. Eg: you could only buy olive oil from the chemists in tiny bottles in my town in 1971. A very great deal has been taken for granted nowadays.

1340 2018-11-15 21:34:27 We can aspire to walk & chew gum. Shifting our energy supplies to renewables will also do a lot to weaken major oil exporter Russia
1341 2018-11-15 21:34:24 The pipeline issue for Canada has now cost our economy $13 billion dollars. Canadian oil is now less than $14 a barrel. We are approaching a record low. Very tough time for the Canadian energy sector right now.
1342 2018-11-15 21:34:20 It's not for the UK though is it? It's for the oil companies. Minus costs of development and extraction and then we get a percentage of the profits as tax. So in reality it's fuck all.

1367 2018-11-15 21:32:07 The greed of man knows no bounds. How they rape the earth to harvest this oil is astounding. And the fires they start are putting massive amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. We all lose.

1.体積積分の積分範囲が0→Rとなります。また面積積分の方はgaussの発散定理を適用した段階で半径Rの球面上の面積分になるので、r^2+2→R^2+2と書き換えてください。

2.この置き換えによって計算結果及び計算コストに変化があるわけではありません。(理由は後述)
1396 2018-11-15 21:28:55 Infact, I think the Irish still owe us billions from the bank crash but that doesn't affect them. We have just discovered huge oil reserves in the north. Even Iceland has half the population and much less of a GDP. Anyway, just finished my chicken Kiev, coffee and TV for a bit.
1397 2018-11-15 21:28:32 Yo, fuck palm oil 
1398 2018-11-15 21:28:30 Put baby oil on your feet and then socks. Thank me later. 
1399 2018-11-15 21:28:27 OMG do you think renewable energy suppliers are in it to - make money?!

Thank god we have coal and oil companies doing it from the good of their hearts
1400 2018-11-15 21:28:27 But we still import their oil!!!!!! I just don't get it.... Such a joke
1401 2018-11-15 21:28:21 Drilling for oil helped save the whales. It replaced whale oil
1402 2018-11-15 21:28:17 Kangin get confused about what to teach Kyu,
because once Kyu incorrectly entered oil when
cooking a simple ham.
1403 2018-11-15 21:28:09 わかったっ！じゃあそうするっ！
1404 2018-11-15 21:28:07 Mark, I wish you’re from Ghana. The Onne Port is designated oil and gas port. Traders can’t go there for rice and motor spare parts. Intels developed and built the facility. You can start from there.
1405 2018-11-15 21:27:51 Lol you went for an oil changed and they told you something else was wrong
1406 2018-11-15 21:27:51 I don't know how old your bro is and pls feel free to share on DM if personal.. But basically my mom boosted my self esteem by signing up to activities she knew I was good at (swimming, oil painting). And a very loving home environment when my mood was lowest
1407 2018-11-15 21:27:50 Oof, not backing them- Lekhomissedem killed my TTO2.5 v Oil
1408 2018-11-15 21:27:50 Not only stocks, but bonds too, real estate, and most assets....Commodities (Gold, Silver, Oil, and emerging markets are going to take off, IMHO.
1409 2018-11-15 21:27:36 Wow the oil market gave up 

I haven't been watching the last few months.. complete shocker..I guess my so many Christmas cards this time
#BrentCrude #WTI #OilShock #oilprice
1410 2018-11-15 21:27:35 I love robotic oil poffins~!
1411 2018-11-15 21:27:30 #RT @Greenpeace: @phonixandflame @Oreo We all love chocolate and we don't want it to go away either  But there are sustainable ways of producing palm oil and that's what we need companies to commit to. The planet cannot afford more deforestation. 
1412 2018-11-15 21:27:25 May has done a terrific job in impossible circumstances the real truth is Brexit is an impossible dream sold to a bunch if suckers by snake oil salesmen.  Now its falling apart at the seams and it has nothing to do with Mrs May she is absolutely right it’s Deal or No deal.
1413 2018-11-15 21:27:17 Two major composition issues in chocolate can cause chocolate bloom. Firstly, the usage of "incompatible fats" in chocolate or coating, and the second issue is found in filled chocolate that has a center rich in oil, and incompatible fats separate from each other after mixing.
1414 2018-11-15 21:27:16 Sounds great! Natural is not equivalent to environmental friendly. Oil & coal are created by nature. Their emissions are huge and a huge danger to humans & everything alive.
1415 2018-11-15 21:27:00 I usually do my own oil changes cause I’ve worked on the business and know the p.o.s out there. But I had no time to do it before I leave for Texas. But ppl act like I don’t look over ever inch touched on my truck and pick them the fuck apart. Smh.
1416 2018-11-15 21:26:58 Feels like the bottom sellers locking in losses gave some good opportunities to the new buyers. Whole market repriced & it could linger but 2690-95 is the level. Oil crashed as expected. Correctly rode $TVIX into the storm w/no shorts. Bought a lot of assets the last 3-4 weeks.
1417 2018-11-15 21:26:49 Actually bad, Russia is one of the few major oil exporters that isn't apart of OPEC
1418 2018-11-15 21:26:48 Yes & everyone in Edmonton saw he could potentially take a one-timer & automatically felt they had a triggerman for 97. That's not who Puljujarvi is. To be fair, he hasn't done enough but he's been given next to no rope. Understood it to a degree last year but not this year.
1419 2018-11-15 21:26:42 Me too,...8 years Navy, then on the Oil road since 2006. I'll be 40 in January, finally can settle down.
1420 2018-11-15 21:26:41 Literally just made a love tincture filled with rose petals, hyacinth, dragons blood oil, and it’s been charging with a rose quartz in the sun all day
1421 2018-11-15 21:26:41 Have you tried CBD oil?  Also Vetiver oil seems to really help my husband sleep.
1422 2018-11-15 21:26:38 Lol even if your primary concern is the economy, it takes an idiot to not realize that the effects of either climate change would be much harder to manage economically than working to completely divest from oil and aggressively pursuing renewable alternatives so like ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
1423 2018-11-15 21:26:35 What body did that 60% come from?
Yeah we need to use less of the stuff, but pretty much nowhere is palm oil free.
1424 2018-11-15 21:26:35 I’d rather drink a quart of used motor oil filled with broken glass.
1425 2018-11-15 21:26:33 No. We have been there, done that! Right in the midst of an oil price crash between Notley and Trudeau they have decided its time for a royalty review, increase taxes, increase regulations, add a carbon tax & cancel pipelines! So $40 billion leaves Ab. & goes to Texas!
1426 2018-11-15 21:26:31 I like the fact that @IcelandFoods are publicly announcing the fact that they don't use palm oil because they are so "eco friendly" yet they are one of the biggest supermarket chains that use the most plastic packaging. I guess we all have a big front we hide behind 
1427 2018-11-15 21:26:24 @CadburyUK no please tell me@you don’t use unsustainable palm oil! I eat Cadbury chocolate every day and you need to fix this before I have to find a replacement
1428 2018-11-15 21:26:23 I have a very close friend who has had amazing results from CBD oil...
1429 2018-11-15 21:26:22 Because people no longer use love to win souls, hence the superstition such as anointing water, handkerchief, anointed oil etc so much so that one could hardly notice any significant difference between some 'pastors''  & traditional healers. These things ought not to be so.
1430 2018-11-15 21:26:19 I need an oil change 
1431 2018-11-15 21:25:58 I just saw an ad for car oil that said "The Earth fights dirty. Fight back"

Who Thought That Was A Good Idea For A Marketing Tagline
1432 2018-11-15 21:25:55 Let Canadas energy CEO's stick it? What an ignorant response. So we can keep importing oil to Canada from Venezuela, Saudi, etc?
1433 2018-11-15 21:25:42 I got my oil change on my truck 2.5 weeks ago @jiffylube where I scheduled a reminder at 5k miles. Since that oil change I have put 400 miles on that truck. The fuck do I need an oil change for now?
1434 2018-11-15 21:25:27 Smoked fish with red oil spag. Dinner was lit!
1435 2018-11-15 21:25:20 You could've been like me and slipped the trainer a 2 litre cooking oil as hush money
1436 2018-11-15 21:24:59 敬語使わんでええやで〜僕のおはよぉいる！と同じ感覚笑
1437 2018-11-15 21:24:57 When oil prices go up the price at the pumps go up within hours . when the oil prices go down the pump prices stay the same.
1438 2018-11-15 21:24:53 Thanks for this.  Keep reading conflicting reports on fish oil.

1440 2018-11-15 21:24:39 You should have stayed on a more popular subject, now your sidelined.
So PFD only from Oil? Dumb idea to suggest all Alaskand reap the windfall prices they get for Salmon? And mining a bad idea Gotcha
1441 2018-11-15 21:24:32 I am focusing on energy stocks. Today $XOM turned around nicely.
Oil has to stabilize before this market can shoot up. IMHO!
1442 2018-11-15 21:24:30 It's amazing that two snake oil salesmen dweebs (CSW & Ver) can capture the attention span of the entire crypto space from both market volume & a media standpoint. 

Meanwhile in *real* cryptoland, there's incredible innovation happening everywhere you turn, and no one notices.
1443 2018-11-15 21:24:20 It's going to be real tough to get red state buy-in on things like more expensive gas and coal/oil extraction shutdowns when everyone can see the Berkeleys of the world won't accept something as trivial as a few apartment buildings amongst their twee craftsman bungalows
1444 2018-11-15 21:24:17 knowing this molasses cookie dough is basically all eggs and sugar and oil doesn’t do much to keep me from wanting to eat it, raw or otherwise.
1445 2018-11-15 21:24:05 cerave has a great daily moisturizer and spf  with hyaluronic acid in it. hyaluronic acid hold like 1000x it’s weight in water ! I also love jojoba oil at night!
1446 2018-11-15 21:24:04 Your head get oil
1447 2018-11-15 21:24:01 I diluted some tea-tree oil into the dogs’ shampoo before giving them baths but I’m not good at math, so they may be having mad tingling rn.
1448 2018-11-15 21:23:46 Especially the meat specials with a bit of chilli oil. Delightful stuff
1449 2018-11-15 21:23:45 NORTH AMERICANS CONSUME MORE OIL PER CAPITA THAN ANY OTHER CONTINENT
1450 2018-11-15 21:23:35 Jeez, the Oil lose another borderline AHL player....  what are they going to do now???
1451 2018-11-15 21:23:26 IEA has worked out the carbon price path required to stabilize CO2 at 450 ppm: US$20/t by 2020, $100/t by 2030, $140/t by 2040. In this scenario, oil demand only drops slowly (unlike coal, which phases out rapidly), and additional sources of oil are needed to meet demand.
1452 2018-11-15 21:23:26 The reality is who cares what Indonesia thinks. Exports Gas, palm oil, rice, rubber & some shitty clothing.  Imports beef, mutton etc.  worse case beef will stop being $36 a kilo in Australia.
1453 2018-11-15 21:23:16 Now to wait approximately 72 years for this oil paint to dry
1454 2018-11-15 21:23:15 Goose bumps goose bumps goose bumps, just heard the @ThePresets covering Midnight Oil’s Power and the Passion on @triplej #likeaversion they absolutely hammered it ~ probs up on the site later today - best like a version I’ve ever heard.
1455 2018-11-15 21:23:14 I agree - Patrik has very unique talent and it is his shot. His all around play is still raw. Jesse's style is different. I think he has more similarities with Mikko, more of a play maker. And it has not yet emerged at NHL level.
1456 2018-11-15 21:23:04 Surely it would be better if we got what we voted for? The political system in the UK is over, we can;t break the country up, we are joined at the hip but, we can make sure our children have a better life. 20 Billion barrels of oil have went south and the UK's bankrupt,
1457 2018-11-15 21:23:01 CBD oil is a great stress reliever. Three drops under the tongue usually does it. You may want to start with six.
1458 2018-11-15 21:22:58 I know
1459 2018-11-15 21:22:46 can u imagine driving w a fuckin oil tank 8 ft long attached to u. Tht shit is crazy.
1460 2018-11-15 21:22:42 もちろんですよお～おはふわっていいなぁ〜使わせてもらお
1461 2018-11-15 21:22:32 #EV don’t need oil. 
1462 2018-11-15 21:22:23 I understand people's concerns about increased risk of an oil spill, but I don't think *economic* arguments hold up - shippers have already booked 650,000 bpd on TMX for the next 20 years (out of 890,000 bpd).
1463 2018-11-15 21:22:15 According to the International Energy Agency, between 2008 and 2020 there has been a 50% decline in oil production due to lack of availability,
1464 2018-11-15 21:22:14 (By the way, the history of snake oil is really quite interesting. High in Omega3 EPA. IIRC, rubbed into aching joints of California railroad builders. Chinese brought it. It became popular and expensive. Increasingly diluted down to nothing at same time as increasingly hyped.)
1465 2018-11-15 21:22:05 Anything for oil donny, or anyone ... how about booting mel out too ... with those snake eyes she certainly looks like a terrorist
1466 2018-11-15 21:21:43 @pneighmond - RE article "Should You Keep Taking Those Fish Oil And Vitamin D Pills?" - am I correct that this study did not look at people with osteoporosis, Paget's disease, or mood disorders? If so, this damn well should be done. Please pass along.
1467 2018-11-15 21:21:29 How about Alberta oil? Could it replace Saudi oil?
1468 2018-11-15 21:21:29 Full of palm oil?
1469 2018-11-15 21:21:13 Rubbish.

They could have mustered the rest of their little cabal and 6 months into the project, hijack proceedings and deliver the snake oil they promised. They had no spine and no backbone else Davies would have resigned earlier
1470 2018-11-15 21:20:46 It's ironic that the fact the Iceland advert was banned, means it got more controversy and resulted in more people paying attention to the underlying message...worked out better for the palm oil movement in a way

(問題文見ると体積領域は原点中心半径Rの球となってますが、①積分する時に0からRとなるのか、その時8πになるのか、②この要素で計算が容易になったりするのかどうか、の2点について疑問に思いました。)
1472 2018-11-15 21:20:41 I will help her look for it
1473 2018-11-15 21:20:36 Seems to me that the auto sector needs the oil sector to power the factories.  Or does Ontario have some zero carbon emitting power plant hidden somewhere
1474 2018-11-15 21:20:27 Cheaper at the dealer than buying the oil lmao
1475 2018-11-15 21:20:24 This is another step to Canada being a 3rd world shithole. Brought to you by the same ppl who celebrated Energy East being cancelled. No protestors? Just for Canadian oil? Ok.
1476 2018-11-15 21:20:23 Are they palm oil free?
1477 2018-11-15 21:20:23 I just know my hair grew so much with these braids lol! Especially with this castor oil
1478 2018-11-15 21:20:23 嬉しい？？なら僕も嬉しい
1479 2018-11-15 21:20:17 Many items in grocery stores and supermarkets contain palm oil and/or other awful things like GMOs, chemical dyes and preservatives. Read the ingredient lists on packages. If you're unsure about an ingredient, look it up or just don't consume it. Be a conscientious shopper.
1480 2018-11-15 21:19:51 It’s actually your flat earth science that was once embraced by Exxon Mobil back in the 70’s when through their own research team, they saw that global warming was caused by CO2 emissions.  They have now as well as other oil corps admitted and adjusted their fuel formulas
1481 2018-11-15 21:19:29 Also a large amount of the still existing large oil reserves are located in unstable middle eastern and African regions, which makes them a lot more difficult to gain access to
1482 2018-11-15 21:19:12 GIVE ME OIL IN MY LAMP I PRAYYY
1483 2018-11-15 21:19:07 Given the oil supply #s this morning, maybe you'll get your wish.

1488 2018-11-15 21:18:42 not to mention the amount electricity used by US auto branch plants in ON or the number times these US branch plants in ON have been bailed out by both federal and ON gov't taxpayers. Left obviously also unaware these cars run on fuel, not exclusively from OPEC oil.
1489 2018-11-15 21:18:42 Yep, their research is invaluable. Didn't mean to dismiss. And we agree that strengthening vehicle standards is critical. I just wanted to note that--given this info re: CA's dirty oil--we also need to intentionally focus on reducing extraction at the same time.
1490 2018-11-15 21:18:28 If I can change the oil in my car and my nigga guess what I am ???
1491 2018-11-15 21:18:25 #SpokesMtg hearing there’s 600 bike shops in Copenhagen. There are 30 in Edinburgh. Similar population. 
There shouldn’t be an expectation every cyclist should be able to maintain their own bike. We don’t require car drivers to prove they can change their oil.

1495 2018-11-15 21:18:16 All for the ad being shown...not all for Iceland’s hypocrisy, essentially telling people that the use of palm oil is causing deforestation, whilst stocking over 200 products that contain said palm oil

1501 2018-11-15 21:17:40 Are you crazy? Trump has done more for working class people than any POTUS since Reagan. His policies are solid. He tells you the truth without typical political snake oil focus group garbage. He has done just what he campaigned on.
1502 2018-11-15 21:17:39 Unemployment at 60 yr low, taxes cut, new businesses at all time high, GDP at 3.8, the Dow was hitting new highs, consumer confidence at record highs, oil& natural gas at record highs, pease between N&S Korea, I could keep going but I'll take the orange guy 100%
1503 2018-11-15 21:17:27 Ooooh, okay this is my area. So I used shea oil when I'm super dry. I add it to my moisturizer at night. But its $10, I get Shea Moisture brand. Also Mad Hippie antioxidant oil is amazing. Just add a few drops to your moisturizer. Clinique super hydration is good imo.

1517 2018-11-15 21:16:34 There’s no true competition. News, oil, mobile phones, coffee shops, and many more markets are controlled by 2-3 corporations. Thinking there is free market competition is rudimentary level capitalism.

1521 2018-11-15 21:16:15 If you’re going to put serious question at the start of a question at least ask a fucking serious question! Told us wouldn’t last 20 years when it was discovered and oh wait massive oil field found November

1529 2018-11-15 21:15:39 Without the US, I suppose anyone who wants your oil reserves could attack and conquer Canada. Isn't China negotiating with you for oil rights? They could just take it. The history of the world is littered with wars to take geography and resources.
1530 2018-11-15 21:15:39 Still expect Puljujarvi to be the better all around player. The problem with Jesse, in the minds of most fans, they look at where he was drafted, his success at the World Juniors & automatically think he should be Patrik Laine but they are nothing alike & never have been.
1531 2018-11-15 21:15:38 I come early to get my oil change because I thought it was gonna be quick. But everybody and they mama is here 
1532 2018-11-15 21:15:37 Good thing for these oil pens

1534 2018-11-15 21:15:36 Noooooo D: you tried olive oil?
1535 2018-11-15 21:15:33 Apparently there’s a similar argument with Nutella and even the sustainable palm oil is causing destruction. I signed the Greenpeace petition and they say they aren’t against all palm oil. It’s a minefield. I’ve just sent you a link
1536 2018-11-15 21:15:31 First of all oil will never finish in saudi arabia the studies that tells u 30 years is bullshit. Second saudi arabia will be the last country in the world to run out of oil due to the Geographical location. So we will other countries will be poor and we still rich 
1537 2018-11-15 21:15:09 Go to Kano and look for it.
1538 2018-11-15 21:15:07 As oil prices fall, $APC adds $ BILLION to its #StockBuybacks plan! (Job cuts and more debt to follow. Exactly what the economy needs, more general Electrics!
1539 2018-11-15 21:14:59 He threw her dead grandchildren and their dead, pregnant mother into an oil tank. What is this woman's damage? Sick!
1540 2018-11-15 21:14:49 don't have to but should if you like your car and especially if has turbos only for like a min or two for oil to warm and lube
1541 2018-11-15 21:14:41 The current year for end of oil is 2050

it will happen when you are alive
1542 2018-11-15 21:14:34 Boys will always be boys 

She'll be alright!
1543 2018-11-15 21:14:24 It has to be all palm oil. Sustainable palm oil is an oxymoron. This is at best a distraction.
1544 2018-11-15 21:14:22 Canadian oil is dirt trading under false pretense.  Same for German coal.
1545 2018-11-15 21:14:22 Energy crisis? Have you seen the massive profits that energy (oil) companies have been making in recent years?
1546 2018-11-15 21:14:21 In other words, as we ramp up renewables WHILE AT THE SAME TIME intentionally reducing extraction, we won't increase our imports from other states. B/c t2/3 of CA oil is so carbon-intensive, reining in the state’s oil production would help decrease global carbon emissions.
1547 2018-11-15 21:14:13 All right twitter people Michigan needs your help again. The Canadian gas & oil Enbridge and Gov. Snyder are secretly planning a move in the Straits of Mackinac where fresh water Lake Michigan and Huron Lake meet. An environmental and economic disaster for for all.
1548 2018-11-15 21:14:12 Oil Prices Are Confirming Global Reflation Is Over
 
The markets, oil, copper, and the Baltic dry index are all suggesting that economic growth has peaked...
1549 2018-11-15 21:14:10 They use Palm oil in these products which is directly linked to deforestation and the killing of great apes and orangutans.  Awful.
1550 2018-11-15 21:14:10 Sizce yasal olan ve önereceğiniz cbd oil hangisi ve nasıl yasal olarak alınabiliniyor
1551 2018-11-15 21:14:03 Just had a look at a list of brands with responsible #PalmOil content. Where possible I will try to not buy from companies that don't use Palm Oil from sustainable sources.
1552 2018-11-15 21:13:59 4. yall freak out over 4 people dead, but Bush starts an oil war with Afghanistan that spans 10+ years and kills thousands of soldiers and he gets reelected

1554 2018-11-15 21:13:47 Does anyone else use castor oil on their lashes?! How you seen good results?! After how long? Please share 
1555 2018-11-15 21:13:42 Then can you care to explain to me the oath that Buhari took that he will safeguard and protect the lives of Nigerians. Malam remember the way we used to abused and cursed GEJ about the matter of BH. We must blame Buhari as long as he is the president.
1556 2018-11-15 21:13:41 Northern Oil Producing Entente has a nice ring to it.
1557 2018-11-15 21:13:38 Don't forget. #palm oil. Re peanut  butter!! It's in 'almost' everything....
1558 2018-11-15 21:13:26 @Justins why are you using Palm Oil in your products???? You're killing Apes and Orangutans!  Please stop!

1564 2018-11-15 21:13:03 Hang them with the charges take them to court and make the case didn't mean hang literally they probably stopped that 1800.

What's the latest news on the American journalist citizen that was killed in Saudi Arabia don't like torture stories GOP Big Oil human rights violation yet
1565 2018-11-15 21:13:02 Reminder: Check your oil levels daily – For compressors that use oil, check oil before every use. Operating with insufficient oil is a quick way to seriously damage your compressor.
1566 2018-11-15 21:12:54 This dude dead ass called me bougie and rolled his eyes bc I said I can only use Dove. Okaaaaaay sorry I can’t change my oil with my body wash lmfao, bye ashy.
1567 2018-11-15 21:12:52 Climate change melts the arctic ice just for countries to go MINING FOR MORE OIL THAT WAS UNDER THE ICE

we may be seeing more of this with #oil at these levels
1570 2018-11-15 21:12:31 Government does not supply health care. Doctors, hospitals, drug companies provide health care. If you don't know the difference between care and insurance, ask your auto insurance agent to change your oil and see what she says.
1571 2018-11-15 21:12:26 "yeah i make my own beard oil"
1572 2018-11-15 21:12:16 DO not think you have anything to worry about, just found new well 50mll barrels same about 3mth back & plenty plenty more to come. But you know when we do for Independence the trolls will come out with "oil running out" They don't want us leaving as OUR oil keeping them solvent.
1573 2018-11-15 21:12:08 Mine too. My mom always says I’m so smart because of all the fish I ate. 

Fish oil for life. 
1574 2018-11-15 21:12:05 ok, no proof, but fairly good evidence from a large and seemingly well-done study.  Could have also been just that they studied higher-risk patients, but most of the alternative hypotheses (eg mineral oil) seem weak
1575 2018-11-15 21:11:59 Are they fighting an oil fire with water?
1576 2018-11-15 21:11:56 oil isn't the only natural resource 

Also you doubt think that as soon as global reserves start to dry up your oil reserves aren't going to be sold to the highest bidder?
1577 2018-11-15 21:11:53 When u go to mr.lube for an oil change and all they do is tell u how shitty your car is... yea thanks I know. Smh
1578 2018-11-15 21:11:39 @CNN @maddow @FOX The White House is a well oiled machine the way your car would be a well oiled machine if you pored oil on the closed sunroof and expected that oil to reach the crank shaft and lifters. #BlueMob
1579 2018-11-15 21:11:38 Thinking about changing up my personal style lately. Gonna start dressing like a detective in a Michael Mann picture and see where that takes me. Unrelated, Shriekback's Oil & Gold is a top 10 album.
1580 2018-11-15 21:11:31 Palm oil certification body @RSPOtweets will only be credible if its #palmoil growers like @Indofood eradicate exploitation, deforestation & destruction of ecologically precious peatland from plantations. They must use this weeks’ P&C vote well! #RT16 #RSPO
1581 2018-11-15 21:11:29 for the better oil since I go from maryland to pa a lot
1582 2018-11-15 21:11:21 Don’t forget oh cleanse, tone then oil. Or cleanse, tone, mask then oil.

1585 2018-11-15 21:11:14 They’re polluting because of the emissions from the gasoline they burn, which is produced from oil, so welcome back to where this thread started.
1586 2018-11-15 21:11:05 @Benecol See you’re not tweeting much. I have a question. As a Benecol user I’m wondering what you’re planning to do about replacing palm oil? Until you offer a palm oil free alternative I’m off the @Benecol bandwagon.
1587 2018-11-15 21:10:50 Bought and paid for. The Saudis and oil interests bought him, so fossil fuels it is until a higher bidder pays for U.S. policies...
1588 2018-11-15 21:10:47 Doug any thoughts on oil? Thanks
1589 2018-11-15 21:10:38 Salaries are useless. .We can't even afford cooking oil. Those who sell what we  want ask for US dollars. Ungazibona usukhumbula UMugabe kumele wazi ukuthi sekunzima..
1590 2018-11-15 21:10:31 i loved it so much now its just oil? like wtf
1591 2018-11-15 21:10:20 Avs fans were also complaining that Mikko was mispositioned, like Oil fans say now with Jesse. At the age of 17 Mikko in SM-liiga 37GP 5G + 4A and Jesse same age 50GP 13G + 15A. Only time tells, but before I always thought Jesse's ceiling could be higher.
1592 2018-11-15 21:10:20 In 30 years time max, when oil is finished, Saoudi Arabia will return to its default tribal desert setting that  has been briefly interrupted by black gold.
1593 2018-11-15 21:10:19 …ｽﾔｽﾔ
1594 2018-11-15 21:10:19 And Canadian oil is now fetching 13.00 US /barrel because we have no where else to sell it, and Quebec can pay world prices for foreign oil. I'm sick of this.
1595 2018-11-15 21:10:18 The DUP think you are a bunch of liars .......... How is that going down ? Tory Manifesto has been torn up ..  and Now May is trying to sell snake Oil to the electorate disguised as brexit when really its REMAIN ..with a Pity Vote
1596 2018-11-15 21:10:07 Haven't had the opportunity yet. I am assuming the acoustic demos and session takes are well-worth it? It's at times like these I so miss running my music store 
1597 2018-11-15 21:10:03 ん、これ油変えた？あーなるほど、ごま油をひまわり油で割ったのか。
1598 2018-11-15 21:09:54 . . Because World demand for Fossil Fuel is FALLING.
Our 21st Century EARTH doesn't need more oil.
Toxic #PollutionForProfit is 19th Century greed & Corruption.
#ClimateChange is Here Right Now.
#CleanEnergy is the ONLY Answer. We still have time.
Our Opportunity is NOW.

1604 2018-11-15 21:09:19 Are You saying that Buhari has nothing to do with the safety and safeguarding the lives and the property of these innocent Nigerians? Pls let's put politics aside and face the reality. Idan kabi goyon bayan karya da zalunci wlh zaka shaida a gaban Allah.
1605 2018-11-15 21:09:13 Exactly, but it's ok to pump millions of sewage in the St.Lawrence and still import millions of barrels of blood oil from the Middle East.

Pierre Andurand, who earlier in 2018 predicted oil could hit $100 a barrel and even predicted that $300 oil is "not impossible", suffered the largest-ever monthly loss of his flagship fund in Oct
1610 2018-11-15 21:08:51 It’s the Irvings we have to estop.  They sell in Atlantic Canada and U.S. northeast markets (and advertise @fenwaypark). Pssst: There are expanding quantities of oil being produced on the Grand Banks that could facilitate removal of @irvingoil from the mBS oil teat.
1611 2018-11-15 21:08:51 silenced and shamed her husbands accusers, thus facilitating his continued sexual assaults

Took millions from oil & gas, facilitated their continued destruction of our planet

Took $$ from Wall Street & bankers who skated despite ruining the lives of millions of people
1612 2018-11-15 21:08:48 Sir, your assessment is misleading. Investors confidence & security for the bond is due to our crude oil. As long as we continue to pull crude oil out of the ground, there will always be a buyer. Those investors don't care if we have something left to take care of people at home.
1613 2018-11-15 21:08:48 Manhattan. Where are on my lost shaker of those tourists covered with oil.

1616 2018-11-15 21:08:12 .@CNRLCareers, we know the truth about your decaying oil and gas wells. When will you create jobs in clean up and reclamation instead of mining and drilling? #abpoli #CleanItUp #polluterpays
1617 2018-11-15 21:07:59 My husb is one of v few experts in eu in the mngmt & treatmt of waste oil -processes, eu envrnmtl law & how laws r applied across eu.

1618 2018-11-15 21:07:56 
1619 2018-11-15 21:07:55 oil is still running out. it's like saying we R all dying, which we R. eventually there will b  no oil as it is slowly being drained.
1620 2018-11-15 21:07:41 And where does your money come from please explain how your going to pay for it all. Now remember that oil gives the UK 495 billion a year. That’s money that will go to Scotland. Now how are you going to pay for it ?????

1625 2018-11-15 21:06:58 I love pretty perks :)))) got a $50 oil change down to $23 by literally just smiling lol
1626 2018-11-15 21:06:51 Pretty feeble oil rally today considering: US petroleum demand was measured by EIA at a record 22.387-million b/d  and net product exports add 2.764-million b/d to that total. We've never produced 25-million b/d of petroleum products. Oil is a supply story - - not a demand story.
1627 2018-11-15 21:06:48 Your dollars are only worth something because of an agreement in the 70s that made the dollar the only currency able to buy oil. It’s worth nothing otherwise.
1628 2018-11-15 21:06:42 As I recall, to the worlds relief, in Hitler's obsession he wrongly chose to fight into bitter Russian winter land instead of going south to oil rich Caucasus that could fuel his military. His obsession became his downfall. So, many lives lost to this man.
1629 2018-11-15 21:06:39 Meanwhile, the same oil sector pays <5% in taxes, receives 3 billion is subsidies a year, and has left us with unpaid liabilities in the hundreds of billions of dollars.

Just because they're effective corporate welfare queens, doesn't mean their great.

When parents who puke over the thought of untested treatments for children inhaled this essential oil three times a day for 30 days, they had improved brain wave patterns and chakral alignments. We have a Black Friday deal for these EOs. Get them now.

Unethical to take bets on who can shimmy up to the top?


K, good. I'll stop by Costco and get a few things of cooking oil if someone can get the spray guns

1637 2018-11-15 21:06:02 You're talking a load of old BALONEY!!  You DON'T know Scotland. We will be happy to pay for independence (NOTE SPELLING!). Currency? Whatever WM wants to pay for OUR OIL, OUR ENERGY, OUR WATER! You know, all those things you can't live without. We DON'T WANT trident. Keep it
1638 2018-11-15 21:05:44 The oil has had a rolling ‘only 10 years left’ for several decades. They are telling fibs

1640 2018-11-15 21:05:36 I hate taking my car to get a oil change they really be selling me stuff I don’t need  I need to learn to say no lol
1641 2018-11-15 21:05:25 no position in nat gas, believe $4bid is real, past jan feb, i believe oil oil falls through 55 and 52, long NQ from below overnight- Gap up risk?
1642 2018-11-15 21:05:23 is anyone keeping track of the new oil field discoveries? We;re up to about 5 new ones since 2014 now, right?
1643 2018-11-15 21:05:18 that what you think ? Don’t compare a galaxy to a planet 
1644 2018-11-15 21:05:05 Accidentally just put cooking oil in my hair thinking it was coconut oil 
1645 2018-11-15 21:05:05 Go lighter on the oil. Don't put it in the pan, put it on the steak itself and rub it into the salt and pepper.
1646 2018-11-15 21:05:05 Oil is economically volatile, but is substantially stable.
1647 2018-11-15 21:05:04 I’ll just mention that the obligatory sex scene includes the “hero” fetching a partly spent six pack of Schlitz from his bedstand … using his toes. Baby oil next to the beer, natch; that’s how you know it’s quality cinema.
1648 2018-11-15 21:04:55 BBC News: The battle of the Christmas adverts: what's the magic formula?

1649 2018-11-15 21:04:55 Scotland is cash positive WITHOUT the oil. 

Then add new business, development and investment. 
The world is queuing up to invest in Indy Scotland.
Scottish Currency will also be the world's newest hard currency and will see phenomenal support and use.

1651 2018-11-15 21:04:37 It's all a game! Until we realise that politics influences the price of bread in the shop, the price of oil, the Standard of living, whether or not we get Healthcare. It's all "games" until we realise politics is in everything we do and we cannot afford to be passive.
1652 2018-11-15 21:04:30 Prayer and coconut oil
1653 2018-11-15 21:04:29 Or are they scared UAE will buy oil from #Barqah #Cyrenaica when the separation comes? And invest in Barqah building their economy?
1654 2018-11-15 21:04:27 You can see what tearing land and Orangutan environment is doing to the place. Another thing, we get palm oil spillages here on the beach in UK and there are warnings for dog walkers - palm oil is poisons for dogs, not good for us either. Peanut oil, coconut oil...choice there..
1655 2018-11-15 21:04:21 This weather has been so terrible for my skin. It’s like no matter how much water I drink, or how much I moisturize, or how much oil I put, it’s still SO DRY!!!
1656 2018-11-15 21:04:19 Except for the very fact most NDP including the current elected group were against oil sands development and pipelines....until they realized to try and stay in power they have to pretend to like it.
1657 2018-11-15 21:04:00 Soalnya dia pakai palm oil yang diproduksi di Indonesia 
1658 2018-11-15 21:03:53 I don't understand how that is even possible. If you're Labour  you're Labour you can't ever be Tory unless you were never truly Labour in the first place. 
It's like oil and water
1659 2018-11-15 21:03:51 Stingray 1x03: 'Sea Of Oil'. That blasted seal!
1660 2018-11-15 21:03:43 Our economy is far more diverse than oil and the oil has another 30,40 years.
1661 2018-11-15 21:03:40 I hate peppercorns. I think I would go with balsamic vinegar, olive oil and sage.
1662 2018-11-15 21:03:38 No excuses needed. Only praise for the economy, border security, foreign policies and oil prices, unemployment numbers down welfare numbers down and optimism up!! What have the libtard done for ya—- excuses?
1663 2018-11-15 21:03:35 How well does this really work for anxiety? I was recently hospitalized for severe anxiety attacks. Thought I was going to have a heart attack if my heart rate didn't come down. I've been considering ordering some CBD vape oil, but don't know much about it's effectiveness.
1664 2018-11-15 21:03:32 Cbd products are now able to process via standard merchant service providers. You no longer will have to process with a high risk provider. This will save your cbd business hundreds of dollars a month. #cbd #oil #creditcardprocessing if you own this type of biz I can help you.
1665 2018-11-15 21:03:26 how do the numbers look with  increasing pollution taxes and a declining oil price as oil is forced to take back its externalized costs and is competitively undercut as a vehicle fuel?
1666 2018-11-15 21:03:23 @chigrl Talk about Clown Shows, how about the land locked Canadian oil! Fed. Gov't won't build pipelines so Alberta gets like $20US/Barrel & then the Maritime provinces buy Oil from the Middle East? 

How stupid is that scenerio?

#Stupid #Crazy #PoorDecisions #Canada #Alberta $$
1667 2018-11-15 21:03:13 #@realDonaldTrump gas prices are going down due to we are not using as much gas, and Trump wants to take off the EPA mileage for new cars, his main concern oil companies keep making huge amounts of money that go into his campaign! Really concerned on lists prices or middle class
1668 2018-11-15 21:03:10 Political statement. Their entire business model is based on burning more oil.
1669 2018-11-15 21:03:00 Tunisia will continue to import oil in exchange for certain goods (Tripolitania?)
1670 2018-11-15 21:02:59 I still think Puljujarvi will be fine & if it were up to me, the goal would be a 25G/50PT player who is a main cog on both special teams and helps anchor the PK.

1673 2018-11-15 21:02:45 I'm all for aggressive protests.  I support their aims.  But I think street protests have little effect.  You need to target high ranking corporate officers.

BTW, I suspect them dropping their plans has more to do with oil prices than street protests.
1674 2018-11-15 21:02:39 Whoa! Says the oil painting himself ?  I’m just saying a little self awareness goes a long way.
1675 2018-11-15 21:02:35 Grenadians when exactly do you eat oil down? That looks like a Sunday evening only food cuz there's no way I'm accomplishing anything after eating that. #heavy

1677 2018-11-15 21:02:21 I am old enough to remember Roger Staubach as the QB for the Cowboys. What a sellout. What a shame. I hope and pray the RAWlings-Staubach snake oil gameplan crashes and burns. Dallas deserves so much more than these cons.
1678 2018-11-15 21:02:15 The real irony is how such a wealthy man could sell himself as Bernie Lite.  It boggles my mind.  But he's a master snake oil salesman.
1679 2018-11-15 21:02:13 I’ve always been sceptical of the MSM and or the agenda they are pushing. Beware of these snake oil salesmen, always question the agenda.
1680 2018-11-15 21:01:56 Just cleaned and sprayed lavender and peppermint oil. Now I want to take a nap 
1681 2018-11-15 21:01:48 If you could provide us with some documentation as to how you are applying the oil we could all get a 'feel' as to what is actually transpiring in the Bahamas. 

Sorry, they told me to say that ;-)

1685 2018-11-15 21:01:37 Whr is their state governor n senators let's not forget abt their local government chairman, house of representatives member n also their state assembly members stop blaming buhari for every single thing.
1686 2018-11-15 21:01:31 Oil oversupply is temporary and market corrections are always possible with time, but loss of human lives from famine is a permanent holocaustic loss for the Human Family.

1690 2018-11-15 21:01:21 You know that, do you? Your smugness gave you the ability to read minds, you hypocrite? Why don't you and your troll buddy (whom you seem to call when things aren't going your way) bust out the Wesson oil for a bit of tug and tussle on the church floormats. How SMALL you are.

1694 2018-11-15 21:00:31 To you kerosene is lamp oil used in slums and villages, but it's also jet fuel powering powerful turbine jet engines like the Boeing Rolls Royce engines through its Jet A1 variant.

1697 2018-11-15 21:00:25 whattttt? I thought oil came before moisturiser!
1698 2018-11-15 21:00:15 Do you use Palm Oil in it like your do in your mince pies?  Thinking of where I do my Xmas food shopping. #PalmOilFree
1699 2018-11-15 21:00:14 I’m just saying they went there because oil related decently paying jobs aren’t there. Nobody goes to Calgary because it has great natural beauty or well designed roadways
1700 2018-11-15 21:00:13 It’s a tactile experience...my wife loves to take a book on holiday, bends corners as page markers and spills sun oil and iced drinks all over it. She says it makes it more readable

1708 2018-11-15 20:59:54 @PresChoice I buy many of your products but am very disappointed to learn that you use palm oil in your protein bars, and many of your other products. I would like to see better from a Canadian company; please will you make changes and stop destroying the rainforests? #orangutans
1709 2018-11-15 20:59:40 Your MCM amboiswa s-curl and the oil sheen made it extra shiny
1710 2018-11-15 20:59:31 But what is the cost of oil for mining an ounce of gold. There are more costs like finding Gold, Capital costs, Land, Regulation. Mixed with high risks beside the price of oil. When the fed admitts that its not going to rise rates any more, then Gold will hit the bit.
1711 2018-11-15 20:59:06 Why can’t those who send out these stupid and intrusive robocalls ( and phishing emails) just be tracked down and vivisected or boiled in oil?

1737 2018-11-15 20:55:46 Where do you buy your #CBD oil online? Recommendations?
1738 2018-11-15 20:55:45 Even your article says "Both VITAL and REDUCE-IT involve fish oil" - which is misleading because it is now clear that there is a very important difference in the effects of a low dose mixed DHA/EPA vs. high dose pure EPA
1739 2018-11-15 20:55:44 Any chance we will stop buying their oil.     NOT LIKELY
1740 2018-11-15 20:55:41 A vat of boiling oil sprinkled on that fence would sure discourage them?
1741 2018-11-15 20:55:40 They do now.. But that’s kinda like vowing to stop playing with matches after you’ve already burnt the house down. Call me cynical but it all seems too little too late. How about instead of using “sustainable” palm oil, just don’t use palm oil 
1742 2018-11-15 20:55:37 IMO, his offensive instincts were & still are better than Jesse's but I also expected Puljujarvi to be a solid two-way player w/ 50-ish point potential and more playing with a guy like McDavid.

1754 2018-11-15 20:54:36 No sorry you are wrong oil was always a bonus, tweed lol is owned by an Englishman, and it is WHISKY, which WM steals the duty off. You grossly underestimate the wealth of Scotland bud, proving you know shit all about it.

1759 2018-11-15 20:53:38 That's great. I really love the CBD oil. I like the gummies, and I also vape it. But the tinctures under the tongue works best. It helps all of these things that likely would trigger a seizure. Take Care. Good Luck.

1763 2018-11-15 20:52:49 Did any one teach you about THC OIL.? THAT Will cure cancer
1764 2018-11-15 20:52:44 Thanks for the tip. This is canned tune btw, so I am not sure if frying is a good idea. 
I made it passable by sprinkling some red pepper and basil and a bit of olive oil on it.
1765 2018-11-15 20:52:29 Recent turmoil in the two commodities was likely due to a massive bearish positions in gas offset by longs in crude oil and "the unwinding of positions in one of these two commodities could potentially have triggered the opposite effect on the other commodity," Citigroup
1766 2018-11-15 20:52:26 At current rates of extraction we have about 40 years left. More if technology improves (and it will). 

More than enough time to make the transition to renewables and save up a Norway style oil fund that generates its own revenue.
1767 2018-11-15 20:52:23 I'm in that age category. Been in oil for 10 years, but at least i have my military pension, if I lose everything else.
1768 2018-11-15 20:52:15 Probably haven't changed the oil in 30,000 miles either...
1769 2018-11-15 20:52:14 Tell her to get rosehip seed oil, organic and unpressed. I get mine from amazing not only does it moisturize but it helps with acne scars too and clears my face. I’m SUPER dryyy btw

1772 2018-11-15 20:52:05 $PCG reminds me of $BP circa 2009 during the oil spill. Fear of the unknown largely drove that market, and once sanity took hold, the shares rebounded. Watching for an entry to short put options and collect the ~300% IV
1773 2018-11-15 20:52:04 For me, Rantanen has slightly exceeded his pts ceiling but not by a ton. In the right spot, saw him as a 70 to point a game player. Now, didn't expect it to happen this quick but he's elevated his play & made the most of skating alongside a superstar & another real good player.
1774 2018-11-15 20:52:00 Chinese hoax, Marxist plot.... what about MAN MADE? everything but curbing the profits of giant oil producers et. al
1775 2018-11-15 20:51:48 Many articles are lumping everything together as "fish oil" and reporting that findings were mixed.  eg. the NYT article in question only mentions VITAL, while by the WaPo article (and headline) makes VITAL sound better than it partly b/c it talks about REDUCE-IT results

1778 2018-11-15 20:51:38 keep throwing oil on the fire gimr
1779 2018-11-15 20:51:28 Aye that's right. There's only 14.75 lites left in the entire North Sea. Wrong type of oil, worthless. Your 3 followers will love that.
1780 2018-11-15 20:51:21 I'm so oily rn,  castor oil on my hair. Coconut oil on my face
1781 2018-11-15 20:51:18 Incredibly dumb.  If so, that would allow reduction of differentials on oil prices. Still a good result.
1782 2018-11-15 20:51:17 What some don't understand is that today's results are in line with 2016 flows.....
But if SS proves this to be a single column of oil from KL3 to KL4 then the OIP and recoverable resources could be double the 2016 estimates... Tick  follows Tock......

1785 2018-11-15 20:51:13 It sounds kinda wrong when you say it out loud, but online retailers should probably cordon off any unsavory wares into ghettos. You wanna search for hate literature? You'll have to enter the specialty store and find it between the donkey porn and snake oil.

1788 2018-11-15 20:50:42 @SenCoryGardner please do not approve Bernard McNamee as FERC Commissioner. He is a climate change denier who states “America is blessed with an abundant supply of affordable natural gas, oil and coal". He has spent years representing the oil and gas industry.

1792 2018-11-15 20:50:14 @jeffflake please do not approve Bernard McNamee as FERC Commissioner. He is a climate change denier who states “America is blessed with an abundant supply of affordable natural gas, oil and coal". He has spent years representing the oil and gas industry.
1793 2018-11-15 20:50:06 Oil
Brent crude rose by US50 cents or 0.8% to US$66.62 a barrel and the US Nymex price rose by US21 cents or 0.4% to US$56.46 a barrel.

1794 2018-11-15 20:50:02 This is inline with my view that oil is important, but not critical.

1799 2018-11-15 20:49:38 Easy. The UK can survive without NI. Those new payments aren't bribes, they're severance pay and Arlene knows it. That's why she's raging. Scotland is indispensable. What will England do for energy, oil, gas, food, and somewhere to park the nukes without us? #DissolveTheUnion

1801 2018-11-15 20:49:34 If you were so concerned for the American People. Like you claimed in 2016. You wouldn't be trying, to reduce oil production. Via Saudi Arabia. Granted Saudi Arabia owns you, it looks as if they call the shots. @realDonaldTrump
1802 2018-11-15 20:49:33 Proper struggle with people that will aggressively support the banning of palm oil whilst simultaneously mocking anything vegan
1803 2018-11-15 20:49:30 Why is @Chevron the last Big Oil company still funding anti-climate ALEC to do its dirty work peddling disinformation? It’s time to drop ALEC [link to graphic]
1804 2018-11-15 20:49:29 How about doing something that actually affects like boycotting Saudi oil.  This is nothing, an empty gesture.
1805 2018-11-15 20:49:25 Murt like mom do you have all the proper ingredients to make cupcakes? We need flour, eggs, oil etc. I'm like nah baby we got funfetti mix... I ain't got time for that home made shit. She said thatll do 
1806 2018-11-15 20:49:15 Soak jar first to remove label, then use cotton wool pad soaked in eucalyptus oil to remove the sticky bits
1807 2018-11-15 20:49:09 See if I see one more windbag, self-righteous MP/MSP rattle on about a 'Precious Union' I'll fucking scream.

Scottish Tories call it precious because they're on the gravy train. English Tories call it precious because the oil is in our water.

Self serving wankers.

1810 2018-11-15 20:48:56 I was doing a classroom observation, and the teacher told the students that OPEC stood for "Oil Producing Economic Countries" and then wrote it on the board so they could put it in their notes.
1811 2018-11-15 20:48:54 He was like oil and water with the older players. Guys on their way out anyway. The guys playing now are the exact types he wanted and could have likely worked well with.
1812 2018-11-15 20:48:50 Not if they have oil rigs on them.
1813 2018-11-15 20:48:48 China's building an artificial sun and launching an artificial moon. Here in the States, we like to continue digging for oil for some reason. And coal wants to be popular again for some other reason.
1814 2018-11-15 20:48:46 Oh yeah my friend gave me this expensive cbd oil I’ve been taking for 3 weeks now! So far no results! It was $150 for a 1 month supply! I love all suggestions   I think I may try Kratom
1815 2018-11-15 20:48:23 Alright Weldon sir but the oil wells in Bayelsa can be shared among the Hausas and Yorubas right? Continue time will tell…
1816 2018-11-15 20:48:21 I think we both agree we should just be out of it.  It’s a religious war that we got involved in for oil
1817 2018-11-15 20:48:20 I love getting my oil changed and getting the chance to listen to every reason why my car could possibly explode at any moment... which they can fix for just $300 more! #nothanks #220kandstillgoingstrong
1818 2018-11-15 20:48:19 Sugar and processed grains and vegetable oil IMHO. Writing “carbs” is too generic. Who is against broccoli and spinach?
1819 2018-11-15 20:48:09 Yo mama's so black every time she gets in a car the oil light comes on" sorry bye 
1820 2018-11-15 20:48:07 If a paddling pool and baby oil isn't involved at some point I'll be highly disappointed
1821 2018-11-15 20:48:06 But we will gladly buy oil from Saudi Arabia and other Muslim nations that murder and abuse women and gays.  You are ALL talk Denmark.
1822 2018-11-15 20:48:03 Thank you I thought about CBD Oil but this is working right now my anxiety and depression and headaches is down tremendously and I am sleeping a lot better without sleep paralysis and that was a nightmare also but things are looking up!
1823 2018-11-15 20:47:59 Yea i love the baby oil with shea butter in it lol
1824 2018-11-15 20:47:39 I'm watching Ag feeds, you guys (oil/energy) and equities feeds. It's like watching three completely different stories unfold on the China front. Add to that the inconsistency coming from executive and admin... So, I'm agreeing with you completely.
1825 2018-11-15 20:47:30 It's time to regulate again(and enforce): Banks, Stock Traders, Oil Companies, Housing, Payday Loans, Guns, Pharma, and Lobbyists. THEN we can think about social media, maybe.
1826 2018-11-15 20:47:25 1771 ~ Industrial Revolution

1990- Internet
2008 - Bitcoin 

Internet and Bitcoin are like Railway and Automobile, and the word Blockchain is completly unnecessary
1827 2018-11-15 20:47:17 Pierce the corporate veil for obfuscating this real danger to public health. Then use the same technique for Exxon & Big Oil for their climate change coverup 
1828 2018-11-15 20:47:13 Which came first, the sucker or the snake oil? Caveat emptor.
1829 2018-11-15 20:47:08 you’ve obviously never tried motor oil
1830 2018-11-15 20:46:56 England has been lead down a path by a group of snake oil salesman pushing a heap of easy answers and slogans for their own egos with no real idea or interest in how to implement them.
You shit in the bed, lie in it.
1831 2018-11-15 20:46:50 That is a bold faced lie and anyone who breathes knows it. Every gosh darn thing that uses fuel or oil in the making. transportation of will increase in price. food. clothing, medications, transportation, public transportation, property taxes, EVERYTHING! dispicable liar.
1832 2018-11-15 20:46:46 i use bawang merah, bawang putih, bawant besar, lada kering and udang kering + air then kisar everything  then arah pot i add oil then tunggu panas add the mixture, then gula, garam and ajinamoto hehe

1835 2018-11-15 20:46:30 One thing we know of the oil industry is the high moral standard they hold themselves to...
1836 2018-11-15 20:46:20 Try rubbing peppermint oil on your lower abdomen if you have some.
1837 2018-11-15 20:46:19 Serious question if Scotland does get independence with IndyRef2 haw can Scotland survive the oil only has until about 2025 or something will Scotland survive with independence, have your say.
1838 2018-11-15 20:46:14 I smell like oil and gas trying to get my gosh darn snow blower workin!
1839 2018-11-15 20:46:13 and adding to that how hardliners spat w/ Canada's leadership over treatment of women jailed f9r politics of change.  But the worst famine resulting from Yemen war is also a sense of solidarity for war victims US that deter US sanctions on Middle East oil nations.
1840 2018-11-15 20:46:04 I have a few of the oil and balm here and it's awesome
1841 2018-11-15 20:46:01 “Growth” in demand. We are not producing 80% of the world’s oil.
1842 2018-11-15 20:45:58 @TheEllenShow You advertise and accept sponsorship from @ProcterGamble Hundreds of their products use palm oil which destroy the natural habitats of orangutans. 25 of these great apes die each day because of companies like P&G. Don't just love gorillas, love orangutans too.

1846 2018-11-15 20:45:41 Bush set records for homeownership

Only when Harry Pelosi prevented oil drilling, and drove prices to $150/barrel did the economy tank

0bama set records for food stamps and suicides
1847 2018-11-15 20:45:32 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
1848 2018-11-15 20:45:29 We all love chocolate and we don't want it to go away either  But there are sustainable ways of producing palm oil and that's what we need companies to commit to. The planet cannot afford more deforestation. 
1849 2018-11-15 20:45:25 Oil prices are falling oo. I hope the diversification has taken hold?
1850 2018-11-15 20:45:13 I need an oil change
1851 2018-11-15 20:45:00 The Shetlands that have been part of Scotland long before the UK even existed, you mean? And according to UNCLOS would be deemed an enclave if it ever became independent and as a result only entitled to oil within 12 miles of its coast...pesky facts eh, son
1852 2018-11-15 20:44:46 That’s fair! I used it for moisturizer for a while but found it to be comedogenic and doesn’t moisturize deep. A good alternative is avocado oil :)
1853 2018-11-15 20:44:29 1984 Big Brother @realDonaldTrump values oil > people.  #1984isnow

1859 2018-11-15 20:43:59 Thanks for your reply. 
I'm sorry, but there are waay too many companies saying they use "sustainable" palm oil that don't know what this means that I won't trust it. 
No more malteasers for me then 
1860 2018-11-15 20:43:59 @tartecosmetics maracuja oil, Hulu subscription, and my Apple Watch 100%
1861 2018-11-15 20:43:55 it would require a lot of analysis. Which is tough. and it is so easy to show a dumpster that is on fire. It doesnt require any analysis. 

Plus you can be sure that big oil, big gas and big coal (and big cars) wouldnt like it one bit and would withdraw their money.
1862 2018-11-15 20:43:51 Something that everyone can do to help is to not purchase products made with palm oil. We haven't in several years. At first it's difficult since it's crazy how many products (food and non) use it, but with label reading and whole food eating it's become relatively easy.

1864 2018-11-15 20:43:49 I never got that oil. Sometimes the way an oil looks is not predictive of its value to your face.
1865 2018-11-15 20:43:38 Atikulooter throws another desperate bait
The oil producing states NEVER said they wanted 100% ownership
That will be unfair
As PMB has repeatedly said, it's the mgt of resources that matters
Those of us that didn't wire millions of $s to US still need some of this oil revenues!
1866 2018-11-15 20:43:29 Checked the ingredients of your @ArnottsBikkies lately peeps?? Most likely they have vegetable oil aka palm oil. Another brand on the ‘do not buy’ list @SquizMakesNoise. Like @POIUK_PalmOil, I refuse to knowingly support deforestation & destruction of threatened wildlife habitat!
1867 2018-11-15 20:43:26 Magnesium salt time to keep the snow away naturally. Plus cooking oil spray keeps the ice off the car doors. Ice is a lot of work. It's why I live down south.
1868 2018-11-15 20:43:25 Olives are pressed to release oil...
1869 2018-11-15 20:43:15 How in any way do  you think the NDP controls the price?  Its the US dumbing cheap shale oil.  This is literally the free market acting like a free market.
1870 2018-11-15 20:43:13 Holy cats that rose hip oil is only ten bucks!

1874 2018-11-15 20:43:02 Its been so volatile that it gets hard to chart ( I did post an NG/OIL ratio chart yesterday though that did reverse nicely). Right now its actually back-testing the white channel in my chart from above so wouldnt be surprised to get a bounce again in the 3.85-90 area
1875 2018-11-15 20:43:00 Are you a brother to Dr Engr Adinoyi Murana?
1876 2018-11-15 20:42:57 I think where you're going wrong starts with putting the words 'oil industry' & 'moral' in the same sentence...
1877 2018-11-15 20:42:52 Je comprends que vous soyez mécontent. Mais c'est un mauvais combat. Qui peut croire qu'on va continuer impunément à brûler des millions de litres de gaz oil, comme on l'a fait dans les 50 dernières années ? Jusqu'à quand ?
1878 2018-11-15 20:42:44 Oil spots can be removed from clothing with Talcum Powder.
1879 2018-11-15 20:42:43 Perhaps I should get separate brushes for oil vs acrylics
1880 2018-11-15 20:42:37 They are boycotting products that have hydrogenated palmoil. Super unhealthy. Red palmoil however is on the super food list. Much healthier than the bleached stuff we call vegetable oil.
1881 2018-11-15 20:42:35 Thieves Oil by Youngliving is like legit the cure for the common cold lol! I used to get bronchitis and end up in urgent care like twice a year but since I started using it I haven’t been there once!
1882 2018-11-15 20:42:28 “actively considering “. That will scare the crap out of them. How about stopping 80,000 barrels of oil per day

Pero a seguir practicando :D

1886 2018-11-15 20:42:13 It’s because they don’t have the land to grow crops for biofuels, and must import it. They either choose not to grow, or can’t because of climate. There’s a billion acres of idle farmland around the world that can be utilized, however. Lots of room to grow and displace oil.
1887 2018-11-15 20:42:11 The way some ladies love cars you will think they were breast feeded with engine oil..
1888 2018-11-15 20:42:11 This day went from meh to outright shit when I found out (at 9.40pm) that I don't have any canned veggies, even thought I was pretty sure I do.
Today's dinner from hell is plain cooked rice with plain tuna (preserved in salty water, not oil!). 
As if eating didn't suck already.

1892 2018-11-15 20:41:53 Is Extra Virgin Olive Oil like 1% milk?
1893 2018-11-15 20:41:45 I have gotten good results with the niacinamide+zinc for my acne + scars. And I like the rose hip oil at night. my face = so soft
1894 2018-11-15 20:41:43 Ahh somebody son will lick oil 
1895 2018-11-15 20:41:42 (4) Who has taken PDVSA's lost market share? In the US, logically, Canadian heavy oil suppliers combined with Brazilian crude exported by private producers. In India, Mexico's Maya is displacing Venezuelan grades while Iran, Iraq and, especially, the US continue boosting exports

1911 2018-11-15 20:39:40 To make cellphones, you need oil, chips that are not made in SA, you need industrial chemicals and gases which are not made in SA, you need technology for which SA has no patents.

But you’re welcome to try, I’ll have left a long time before that happens.

1913 2018-11-15 20:39:37 Thought I was Reading an article on The Onion and not CNBC.  Trump "Duped" OPEC?  I find that really hard to believe. Thank god that I have no investments in Oil.
1914 2018-11-15 20:39:19 No I don't. I think it is a legitimate criticism of the actions of the govts of Saudi and Iran for instance and not an indictment of the individual people of those regions.

I strongly oppose the corporations that buy their oil and our selling them weapons and I love their people
1915 2018-11-15 20:39:14 1) Trump tries to destroy the European Nordstream 2 project. Just to sell his stupid fracking oil + gas that's 30-40% more expensive to Europe. #MERKEL HATES BULLIES!
2) Politicians need to think at least 50 yrs. ahead = where do we stand when supply get's scarce?
1916 2018-11-15 20:39:11 I’ve been using cbd oil for about 6 months and it has made a noticeable difference to me, whereas I was visiting the Osteopath one a month to sort my back out, I’ve not visited them since may.
Definitely worth my money!

1918 2018-11-15 20:38:56 Agree. Average car is on the road for 20 years. ICE cars will loose their coolness though, so resale value will hurt. Big oil is in trouble, but will indeed result in lower gas price. Oil will balance at 25$/bbl once demand starts sliding and be sourced from Saudi Arabia.
1919 2018-11-15 20:38:51 Ship? Lol. This is a bunch of old growth national forest lumber nailed together on top of some 55 gallon toxic waste drums tied together with Chinese made Trump ties propelled by lies mixed with KFC fry oil.

1929 2018-11-15 20:37:51 The targets in Zarrab are Iranians and Turks. The sanctions were Saudi. So they are all in the ME but I'm not sure how connected. Erdogan is a Saudi adversary working with Qatar. He wasn't to size the Kingdom. Steal the oil.  IMO.
1930 2018-11-15 20:37:40 Bit bizarre - how much palm oil is in polyester cardies?! Looks more like freeloading on viral marketing to me!
1931 2018-11-15 20:37:39 what is the perfect record to listen to on a snow day? i want play through all of them at work tonight.
1932 2018-11-15 20:37:35 That right ?

Sooo, how much did oil bring in last year ? 

I’ll wait here. #deluded
1933 2018-11-15 20:37:31 Saudis - I’m tired of calls for Trudeau to cancel the Saudi defence contract. It does squat to affect SA only putting Cdns out of work. That’s inconsiderate and only hurts Canada. Really want to actually help? Stop listening to the BS. Support pipelines and stop buying Saudi oil!
1934 2018-11-15 20:37:19 Irrational anxiety 748388: getting an oil change and being TERRIFIED that you’re going to drive into the pit.

1936 2018-11-15 20:36:45 Brexit sounds stressful and all but let me tell you, I just saw an Italian chef realize he's out of olive oil
1937 2018-11-15 20:36:43 My hair been braided for 3 weeks and I’m ready to take them down.  Atleast try to last two more weeks. they don’t look bad it’s just my scalp be super dry. Even though I oil and moisture my hair every other day

Nice.
1939 2018-11-15 20:36:40 You know its getting bad with #Brexit when you start to wish the USA would invade...I mean liberate us for the oil.  Democracy for oil isn't such a bad deal
1940 2018-11-15 20:36:21 Health tip, do not use canola oil it is made from rapeseeds which are bad for your organs & cause your blood to clot. Also look for benzyl derivatives in your food, lotions ,shampoos and everything . Do not use it Benzene equals gasoline equals carcinogen
1941 2018-11-15 20:36:10 Yea. And unless ur driving a monster truck it's like $1.50 per full tank more than it would have been if we voted to lower it. And it's not like it was increased lol it stayed the same. People should be mad at oil corporations not voters
1942 2018-11-15 20:36:04 I need a Toyota or some shit cause why am I paying 70 dollars for an oil change.
1943 2018-11-15 20:36:01 Now this is human nature and my psychological approach has gotten to you, so how did you feel exactly? Then you see the need to call the president out as time is no longer on our side.
1944 2018-11-15 20:35:50 It’s very misleading. Basically just their new own brand Christmas range doesn’t have palm oil
1945 2018-11-15 20:35:42 Russia supplies gas to Ukraine despite being virtually at war.

1948 2018-11-15 20:35:25 Stripping the regulations allows oil and coal companies to plunder and pollute the planet unchecked for profit. The US can be a global leader in renewable energy. But Trump appoints coal and oil lobbyists and ceos the US will continue to fall behind the rest of the world.

1955 2018-11-15 20:34:46 Baby oil... old school.  Need help?
1956 2018-11-15 20:34:46 What I keep in the back of my mind is that in 1933 (the last time when gold mining was an excellent business) the Gold Oil Ratio stood above 50 (35 USD per oz Gold / 0.67 USD Barrel). The miners soared in February 2016 when this ratio breached 40. The miners need an Oil collapse.

1960 2018-11-15 20:34:30 Ohhhhhh there's oil in a bag for the feets now. Oh they upgraded for real
1961 2018-11-15 20:34:27 This is simply due to your manner of approach and tone, then latest reply to me like yesterday.
1962 2018-11-15 20:34:23 All of our products have a full ingredients list on the packaging, Molly and we're committed to using only the most sustainable sources of palm oil in our products. 1/2
1963 2018-11-15 20:34:20 Yup cos all oil producing nations went bankrupt when oil prices fell, some even rushed to join ultra rich UK to help save them..
1964 2018-11-15 20:34:16 I'm not trying to minimize the problems Alberta is facing, what with the FCA decision in August, plus the Enbridge natural gas pipeline rupture (reducing demand for Alberta oil), plus the US court decision on KXL. I'm just saying that Ottawa is pushing pretty hard for TMX.
1965 2018-11-15 20:34:13 Guess who owned and controlled 95% of the oil production in America in 1900
1966 2018-11-15 20:34:11 And the AMA has decided to establish just what we need ... another standard, or data model (IHMI). Madara called #digitalhealth "snake oil" before the AMA set up its own digital health shop. I like to think their heart's in the right place but some of this looks territorial.
1967 2018-11-15 20:34:03 So let’s have a bet. Who gets control over their oil after the regime change ?
1968 2018-11-15 20:34:03 No in that order is a cake decorating thing so I can make some kick ass cakes... And my kids special toothbrushes.. I mean Jesus why do they torture me.. Oh and my oil dispenser like the one @altonbrown uses.. They are torturing me!!!

1970 2018-11-15 20:33:50 A person that will rise inflation that will never fall back in other to attract investors is not fit to run a country like Nigeria because that's thesame tactics Venezuela with more oil reserved than Nigeria play which dip them into financial mess ever.

1972 2018-11-15 20:33:33 It's hard to believe people are so uneducated to not see how many things require oil! We are blessed to have natural resources in this country. Yet we want to be dependent on communist countries. We even need the states if war breaks out. We have become so dependant on everything
1973 2018-11-15 20:33:31 i mean it when i say that nothing makes me cry quite as much as the commercial where the ducks from the oil spill are being cleaned by dawn dish soap

1976 2018-11-15 20:33:11 When you press puff-puff, e go shrink before e bounce back- in other words, like we say in economics, puff-puff is elastic & absorbs oil. On the other hand, when you press buns, e no dry shrink- it is inelastic & absorbs less oil. I hope you find this useful.

1985 2018-11-15 20:32:18 I know in n out uses sunflower oil!
1986 2018-11-15 20:32:05 It's only on their own brand products but its a start.  With a bit of research we can all change some of our shopping habits to boycott those companies who source palm oil in a destructive way wherever we shop.  It's so complicated though, it is I'm everything!
1987 2018-11-15 20:31:47 That looks like oil pastel. I love the chunkiness of the edges. What is it?
1988 2018-11-15 20:31:45 Morocan oil work wonders for me as well coconut oil? Give them a shot... that should do the job...
1989 2018-11-15 20:31:40 Yes that’s exactly the Globalist plan, break us all, take ownership of the oil and get pipelines built for the Chinese and their buddies
1990 2018-11-15 20:31:36 Tom is cooking dinner. Apparently the potatoes have been anointed with olive oil and salt. I’m looking forward to this  I love cooking but it’s such a treat to be cooked for too.

2006 2018-11-15 20:30:04 The banned @IcelandFoods advert has really opened my eyes to the palm oil issue. It wasn't really on my radar before and it's definitely having an impact on my decision making #covhour

2009 2018-11-15 20:29:55 It's because WCS is  a very low grade oil.
2010 2018-11-15 20:29:48 Thanks ma. I'm at home in Tz, so I have access to both. I've stopped bleeding, but my nose is dry, I worry that it'll bleed again in my sleep. Tried putting some coconut oil but inakauka fast  I'm ok though. Kisses
2011 2018-11-15 20:29:43 @BorderBiscuits I didn't buy a packet of Border dark chocolate gingers today as the ingredients list didn't tell me that the palm oil in them was from sustainable sources. When are you going to start using palm oil from sustainable sources and stop killing Orang Utans.
2012 2018-11-15 20:29:39 This should read Ont & Qc dairy farmers since you've hogged all the quota for decades.  Didn't see you "stand together" with us over the pipeline.  You don't want us to buy U.S. milk but its all good that you buy their oil?

The 2.5% Royalty is in place now (since Oct 1)

Believed to be worth $1MM /year.

If Tamarind gets cardiff working that # will rise. Or if oil rises to $100

The Royalty can fetch 5-7X fwd cash flow - it could be sold for 1 special div to tag oil

2045 2018-11-15 20:26:30 I'm still OK with clinging to my long held opinion that the oil industry needs less subsidy and not more. If the economics improve enough to support their expansion plans, they'll negotiate with what they have and get it done. Right now nobody wants the turd they put on the table
2046 2018-11-15 20:26:19 You do realize that so-called "renewables" depend on rare earth metals, and that over 90% of the world's rare earth metals are controlled by China? That even Germany went back to using coal? That many European countries lower emissions by depending on fuel & oil from Russia?

2060 2018-11-15 20:24:50 No surprise, Gabriel & Germany’s true feelings! 

Trump to Merkle, “you are buying oil from Russia making Putin rich and want is to protect you from him too.” Makes soo much sense! 

Germany swapped Brown shirts for Mullahs & Burkas in 75yrs W/rising anti-semitism!  
Nein danke!
2061 2018-11-15 20:24:49 The 'everything bubble' didn't burst yet because the price of oil is going down. The Fed is taking their chances by artificially inflating the US Dollar Index and raising interest rates. The EM can't deal with all these stresses.
2062 2018-11-15 20:24:34 WTI Crude Oil +0.5% at 56.44 bbl $USO
Gold+0.4% at 1215.10 oz $GLD
Copper +1.5% at 2.75 lb $CU
2063 2018-11-15 20:24:30 I’m sorry :( I’m about to try some cbd oil
2064 2018-11-15 20:24:17 @DrOz has been selling snake oil as medicine to people for years. PLEASE do not sign on with this grifter to get our message out.
2065 2018-11-15 20:24:10 As a baby boomer, it will be our lasting legacy of shame to future generations.  We let the powerful oil and gas money machines dupe America.
2066 2018-11-15 20:24:09 I get it all every day. People coming from a dealership or express saying they needed this or that and it actually doesn't. Also people who come in for a tire repair or oil change and desperately needs tires or brakes but don't believe me.
2067 2018-11-15 20:24:01 Going well since starting on the CBD oil balm & capsules,waking up fresh and the morning walk with the dog is great,feel it a bit after but I'm doing more things now,massive thanks to @CBD_Support  for all the help with my recovery 
2068 2018-11-15 20:24:01 yes and no..I know we need the oil fields .I just wish they did better with the runoff and tailing ponds.    they need to take better care of HOW They do things..
2069 2018-11-15 20:24:00 Oil trumps all
2070 2018-11-15 20:24:00 Question on CBD oil: should be safe, no THC. However, not sure what you’re getting as there are no standards. #ABM18
2071 2018-11-15 20:23:45 In fact the Trump administration granted extensions that allow those countries to continue to buy Iranian oil. Saudi Arabia and Russia now have a surplus of oil that they can’t sell at the moment thus driving oil prices down. 2/2
2072 2018-11-15 20:23:38 A guy at the gas station just tried to help me check my oil. Like my dad is a mechanic, I think I know how to fix my own car 
2073 2018-11-15 20:23:20 Tudo bem que foi depois do tombe de 5% da sangria do preço do oil
2074 2018-11-15 20:23:07 coconut oil? Lol
2075 2018-11-15 20:23:01 That it has been successfully employed. Standard Oil notwithstanding.
2076 2018-11-15 20:23:00 People think that the Lord wants them to be a good Samaritan. But only He has the wine and the oil. 
So who is your neighbor whom you should love?
Love the Lord Jesus!

2077 2018-11-15 20:22:58 Totally agree on Oil and gas subsidies, movie moguls, using the police against the people, Tiwai Point, Saudis, finance company bailouts and similar but some spending is for everyone's future eg climate change, rail, r&d
2078 2018-11-15 20:22:57 I have to be in a relationship to do basic shit like get my oil change lol that’s weird
2079 2018-11-15 20:22:49 Russian econ disengaged from oil above $40 bc budget rule: excess money is sterilised and can’t be spent. Hence no growth effect from $80 oil. 

But. New budget increase cut off to $70 so next year will make a diff. If oil stays high that is...
2080 2018-11-15 20:22:37 The oil less fryer works pretty nice too.
2081 2018-11-15 20:22:35 for example: 2008 oil market. artificially created by rampant speculation in the futures market, london ICE exchange
2082 2018-11-15 20:22:10 Honestly im positive people only put sugar, oil and butter in food because they can't cook ew
2083 2018-11-15 20:22:06 Has Chilwell swum to #Wembley though an oil slick tonight? Good god, his hair is going to be invited to join OPEC! #EngvUSA #EngUSA #rooney
2084 2018-11-15 20:22:03 So much for the anti-Brexit protest vote. Lib Dems are slippier than an eel in baby oil, as trustworthy as a fox in a chicken coop and as useful as a chocolate fireguard
2085 2018-11-15 20:21:48 As long as corporations own our government, nothing will change.

Nothing.

Oil and natural gas companies ensure our planet will burn. Healthcare companies ensure we will never have universal healthcare.
2086 2018-11-15 20:21:35 I fully agree. The capitalists have developed many instruments to tie the people to the market, which gives them direct tools to disincentivize "wrong" behaviors. Threaten oil profits? Say goodbye to retiring before you're 75.
2087 2018-11-15 20:21:34 also your opinion on his plan to sell nnpc and deregulating oil downstream while his party is preaching fuel price reduction
2088 2018-11-15 20:21:30 Confined animal feeding operations (CAFOs)are terrible for the environment, so is palm oil and soy bean production. Animals can be raised on marginal lands that can not support crop production and ruminants turn grass into something digestible and nutrient dense
2089 2018-11-15 20:21:26 The reason oil prices have gone down recently is because Trump promised Saudi Arabia and Russia that the US would halt Iran from exporting oil to countries that are dependent on Iranian oil by Nov 4th. That didn’t happen. 1/2
2090 2018-11-15 20:21:22 Lalela ntombazane I've got cooking oil and mazoe crush so wasup

2093 2018-11-15 20:21:04 Why not just pour some vegetable oil on it?
2094 2018-11-15 20:21:00 Here are Diane Greene's, CEO of @googlecloud, key takeaways from the #LetsTalkAI conference:
1. Have a #data #strategy, it’s the new oil
2. Have an #AI integration strategy built around a long term vision
3. Think big, start small
2095 2018-11-15 20:20:57 Facts or the deodorant smh I use plant base soap shampoo and oil for my skin 
2096 2018-11-15 20:20:54 I can really recommend Jaimie's CBD oil. Great quality and very effective. I am pain free!! Thanks millions
2097 2018-11-15 20:20:52 どこの話だろう。コリアまいったなぁ(棒

2100 2018-11-15 20:20:27 #tagoil conf call today; takeaways;

Tamarind deal was done on Oct 1. Meaning at $22 higher oil prices before the price fell out of bed. This is good for Tag shareholders. 

takeover Vote likely Jan 1st week.

2101 2018-11-15 20:20:20 A2: By being authentic and tapping into consumer emotions with a poignant message. Look at the Iceland/Palm Oil situation. Banned from tv but huge engagement on social. #HootChat
2102 2018-11-15 20:20:14 We say the solution is government, then we say the solution is us the people, then we say it's civil servants... the truth is we don't know. But until we know, we will continue to haemorrhage everything good - doctors, engineers, our crude oil.. Everything. In return for nothing.
2103 2018-11-15 20:20:00 Allah protect dem
2104 2018-11-15 20:19:52 I hope so cuz babu time,they really need to act fast dai.

2107 2018-11-15 20:19:39 Man i drunk some castor oil, i feel so fucking sick to my stomach
2108 2018-11-15 20:19:29 And then Saudi pushes for more oil production which plummets the price of oil and at the same buys up a shit load of US treasury debt off the Asian & Russian dumping of the same toxic asset. Mission accomplished.
2109 2018-11-15 20:19:23 Like a strike? A live picket line. Oh please dress that stage with a burning oil drum.
2110 2018-11-15 20:19:21 Are you dilated at all? If you are do the castor oil in some oj
2111 2018-11-15 20:19:13 Y’all “males” need to start walking in the spirit of husband... pay her bills, buy a house, get her oil changed, fix some shit, shovel snow, take out the trash, tell her be ready at 7, wipe yo whole ass, mend yo childhood trauma, stay out of Dm’s, wear chapstick & lotion
2112 2018-11-15 20:19:11 Cheap oil. Market is slow to figuring things out. No wonder I can outperform the market. Duh

2118 2018-11-15 20:18:44 Both do, no doubts here. But Ukrainian growth in 2018 has been double the rates of Russian growth.

And remember high oil prices were in the past several months. It did not translate in higher growth for Russia.
2119 2018-11-15 20:18:37 I cleaned out my car and we got the oil refilled and I'm

Tired
2120 2018-11-15 20:18:23 Who would like to try CBD oil?
2121 2018-11-15 20:18:19 Peel Ports want to decom oil rigs in the Clyde in SSSI. @ScottishEPA @TerryAHearn a project this dangerous and complex needs an EIA!@FairlieCoastal @foeglasgow @clydemarineplan @SNHbiodiversity
2122 2018-11-15 20:18:15 That has bn done, he said he's informed the president and something will be done soon
2123 2018-11-15 20:18:14 Great but let's just keep our oil fund in the ground, rather than hacking it out of the ground of a warming planet. Win. Win.
2124 2018-11-15 20:17:59 How low does oil production need to go before government is unable to maintain loyalty/stability? asks @DiegoMoyaOcampo (@IHSMarkit) > If economy does badly, it weakens the gov but also society: question of relative power, says @ricardo_hausman.
#LSEVenezuela
2125 2018-11-15 20:17:57 I agree with this wholeheartedly except for the facts > opinions but.
It shouldn’t even be a greater than/less than system. They should be oil and water, no relationship whatsoever.
2126 2018-11-15 20:17:47 I'm sure you're speaking from experience I certainly am I live in Houston Texas been in and around the oil business and the cattle business there are plenty people who want to work in these jobs but there is a continual flow of low-wage workers coming across our border
2127 2018-11-15 20:17:34 Kubica nie dostał od rządu te 40 mln tylko od ORLENU!!!
2128 2018-11-15 20:17:25 Best-case scenario, we end up with something like the class-action lawsuits against cigarette companies that provoked industry-wide change. More likely, the oil companies drag out the lawsuits for 30+ years and the world burns down while the crabbers are waiting for hearings.
2129 2018-11-15 20:17:23 Oh, I saw that. I meant the politicians won’t publicly confirm their intent until they get elected. Except in like minded company of course. Subversive tactics.

That’s Kenney’s plan. Been trying to tell people, but not having much success. Notice he focuses on oil, not social.
2130 2018-11-15 20:17:22 Cup need a oil change, activist I let her pour
2131 2018-11-15 20:17:11 Join us tomorrow for Regions Unbound at #AmAnth2018 San Jose 2:00 pm. Hear about oil, placeknots, cattle smuggling and fugitives - Middle East to South Asia @westsyduics
2132 2018-11-15 20:17:03 Patriotic Americans that live near our borders. Let me simply say. I'm not saying to do this. Although, if someone would take their used oil and pour it over the metal fences the invaders are climbing....... Humpy dumpy might fall off the wall again
2133 2018-11-15 20:17:01 Just take that bitch to a shop and get the oil change. What the hell?
2134 2018-11-15 20:16:58 Spent too much time deep in the trenches on LRT. Designs are extremely flawed. Co-locate of heavy rail hauling oil within the same 100 foot right of way with LRT passengers Disaster in the making just a matter of time.
2135 2018-11-15 20:16:52 Nymex Settles 11/15/18 - CL Dec18: 56.46 (+0.21) (-6.9% vs Last Week) #nymex #wti #oil
2136 2018-11-15 20:16:52 You're dreaming. KochBros are the architects of taking down US democracy, oligarchs who are int'l big oil & industry who got their money the old fashioned way--they were born with it. They consider working classes peasants who need to work for crackers & then die.
2137 2018-11-15 20:16:52 I brought my wife's van in for an oil change and they can't find it now.
2138 2018-11-15 20:16:37 And global warming is going to flood New York by 2005 and all the oil will be drilled and used up by 1988 and leaving forests in their natural state is best and lettin a forest fire burn in Yellowstone is the environmentally right thing and banning plastic straws will save the...
2139 2018-11-15 20:16:33 Veggie straws are so oil 
2140 2018-11-15 20:16:33 Not a preachy vegan at all. But please don’t rant on social media about Palm Oil if you still eat meat on a regular basis. Same goes for you Iceland.
2141 2018-11-15 20:16:25 *hits oil pen discreetly in courthouse and stands up from the jury* “This whole court’ssss out of orddderrrrr.”
2142 2018-11-15 20:16:17 Check your Engine oil this weekend.
2143 2018-11-15 20:16:16 Remeember Khashoggi? Well just breaking, Trump wants to turn over a cleric to Turkey that has sanction here to get Erdogon to stop releasing the truth about what happened to appease the Saudis. What will that do to oil prices?
2144 2018-11-15 20:16:14 There are no “regimes”. There are greedy people with personal interests in Oil and Gas. They will kill anyone that gets in their way and they will stop at nothing to get what they want. Including the toppling of entire countries, including the United States.
2145 2018-11-15 20:16:11 Day after day, you tweet about the failures of the Conservatives, while dodging the issue of your own government's hypocrisy in throwing billions of dollars at a failed oil pipeline project that would obliterate any hope for Canada to meet our Paris commitment.
2146 2018-11-15 20:16:10 Oil is expensive  ::
2147 2018-11-15 20:16:09 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, and the media to begin asking questions on their behalf.
2148 2018-11-15 20:16:07 In this week's Commodity Market Update, we look at the impact of current geo-economic tensions on falling crude oil prices, which have dropped below $58.00/barrel. Conversely, natural gas prices have 1/2
2149 2018-11-15 20:16:02 Need to oil my scalp today
2150 2018-11-15 20:15:53 What that Quora article does not mention is that 
1.Dardanelles is free international waters till 2023 after which Turkey will own it and can charge for using the water way
2. Turkey is not allowed to explore for Gas & Oil & it will be free to explore its Gas& oil
2151 2018-11-15 20:15:39 The US Govt clearly hasn’t learned anything from the #Khashoggi murder, either. Speaking for myself, I’d much rather we cut off military aid and oil purchases and force ourselves onto a path of peace and renewable energy than lie in bed with a tyrannical regime.
2152 2018-11-15 20:15:37 I love it when I randomly catch a whiff of my oil diffuser :) #normallynoseblind #ismellgreat
2153 2018-11-15 20:15:30 Sry for asking but I didn't know drinks like Monster Energy use palm oil, I wouln't really expect oil in a drink 
I just wonder how they use it?
2154 2018-11-15 20:15:28 Put an oil supplement in his grain , hay cubes , black oil sunflower seeds, also try to keep his blanket on as much as possible (obviously if it’s warm don’t) the more he has his blanket off when it’s cold , the more calories will burn
2155 2018-11-15 20:15:21 Fyn! Abba ze samo

2157 2018-11-15 20:15:15 that palm oil advert for iceland was used as a greenpeace advert months ago so why only now is it getting recognition?
2158 2018-11-15 20:15:10 I do wish I could oil them up
2159 2018-11-15 20:15:04 The brexit MEGAWANK!

Wall to wall coverage of BoJo, JRM and Farage, in their pants, rubbing each other with hot oil and wiping away the time to no deal orgasm.

2162 2018-11-15 20:14:39 Last year the Coast Guard Commandant told me they were not prepared for an oil spill in the #GreatLakes & that more research must be done. That’s incredibly alarming—40 million people rely on the Great Lakes for safe drinking water.
2163 2018-11-15 20:14:38 The Hemp Oil I bought does seem to be working with my anxiety. Maybe I need to take more? I'm not happy tonight.... I dont feel ready for anything mentally, but I'm going to work out in a minute and see what happens.
2164 2018-11-15 20:14:38 I know a shop
2165 2018-11-15 20:14:38 Ok i now i understand,maybe we can mention @MBuhari SSA so they can help inform the president cuz most of them read tweets and replies. The person handling @MBuhari  handle is as good as the governor.
2166 2018-11-15 20:14:31 I’m pretty certain #Scotland was told in 2014 that the oil was about to dry up before the #indyref 
2167 2018-11-15 20:14:23 I agree completely on state using revenue but you're on a slippery slope when YOU define MY vices i don't consider using cbd oil for my seizures a vice. I spent 40 years working, raising a family paying taxes and eating stress for lunch daily. I earned my right to use legal weed
2168 2018-11-15 20:14:19 So all this while, you've been feeding your home girl engine oil....SHEME!
2169 2018-11-15 20:14:17 Amazing intelligence gathering. They cant even tell when Jadran down the street from oil fascilities will attack again.
2170 2018-11-15 20:14:14 Imagine pple that don't know our sacrifice and support fr Buhari even when we weren't eligible to vote, we were foot soldiers, I hv bn With Buhari all the time he's contested, even now,  but the love won't make me not call him out when need be.

2171 2018-11-15 20:14:12 Well played Google search. The Groupon $39.99 Winter Tire and oil change special at Jiffy Lube. Ya it was only in Ohio. #Fail
2172 2018-11-15 20:14:08 why not promote tax breaks for purchasing electric vehicles. 
then our own province can power these vehicles with our own electricity.
we can get off foreign oil with more EVs. 
once EVs go mainstream, prices come down and we WIN.
2173 2018-11-15 20:13:48 Trzeba najpierw wprowadzić jakiś podatek dla zdobycia pieniędzy dla siatkarzy, a przy okazji będzie na nagrody dla swoich, BO IM SIĘ NALEŻĄ!!!!
2174 2018-11-15 20:13:46 Used oil paints for the first time in a couple weeks and now my head is throbbing
2175 2018-11-15 20:13:44 the coconut curling cream, i use the argan oil leave in, jojoba oil for shine and moisture
2176 2018-11-15 20:13:39 What about the govt employees who send our soldiers to die for oil, central banks and Israel’s holy wars?   They’re promoted  #bringTheTroopsHome
2177 2018-11-15 20:13:30 Thankfully, the oil and gas industry is getting in shape. Next year will be better, hopefully.
2178 2018-11-15 20:13:13 how long you out there trigga i think i need an oil change
2179 2018-11-15 20:13:11 THere's no oil me up option for Kassandra? WHAAAAT? Poor girl's gonna get dry skin. Then again neither Kassandra or Alexios need MORE help bursting into flames.
Right now my boss fight tactic is jsut to go FLAME ON and hug them.
2180 2018-11-15 20:13:01 Someone recommended beard oil. Going to try it, I just dislike having oil on me haha
2181 2018-11-15 20:12:53 หนูเพิ่งเห็นทักไปแล้วนะ
2182 2018-11-15 20:12:50 Who knew that getting an oil change and all new breaks would feel like my heart was ripped from my chest
2183 2018-11-15 20:12:50 You know timing has never been my thing. Years ago I bought part share in a 2-stroke oil business just as everyone was going 4-stroke, & recently I bought a lorry load of razors, just as beards made a comeback 
2184 2018-11-15 20:12:34 Batteries. The system depends on every home having a large battery (about the size of a fridge) that has 3-5 days capacity. Up to 15-30 days as capacity increases. Only thing standing in the way is big oil & complicit government. 

EV cars can be considered storage well.
2185 2018-11-15 20:12:29 Yes, definitely had to burn the midnight oil  for many nights I would want to cry but I soldiered on
2186 2018-11-15 20:12:25 Yeah the environment on palm oil was good advert, will check out Aldi one lol
2187 2018-11-15 20:12:24 Yup, Euro area is biggest importer of energy. Note how it is now more stable vis-a-vis commodities, gold, oil... For Oils a huge incentive to switch would there be way how they could park their surplus in Euros.
China does it via investment now.
2188 2018-11-15 20:12:21 Someone asked me, as I was walking down the street in suburban Maryland, ‘You got any spare change, or any spare oil?’
2189 2018-11-15 20:12:10 Mandatory service would put the sons and daughters of the rich on the front lines. Maybe that way we'll have fewer oil wars.
2190 2018-11-15 20:12:02 It  is indeed a silly game, but if you don't expect more than what it actually is, it can be a blast to play.  Now if I can just get some of that Chemo Synthesized Oil.....
2191 2018-11-15 20:11:50 Magnesium glycinate, malate or citrate. Works to relax muscles w/o narcotic effect. CBD oil AND rub. Epsom salt bath followed by 10 min ice pack. You want to reduce the inflammation & trauma before you start stretching. Then yoga when you’re feeling better. 
2192 2018-11-15 20:11:45 This is the same guy who gloms $Thousands in dues from Alberta oil patch workers and then funds pipeline protesters.

2198 2018-11-15 20:11:09 It has been proven that both internal combustion motors fueled by Hydrogen or Methonol can run so pollution free that the exhaust emissions can be cleaner than the air taken in through the engines air cleaner! Neither one requires oil so it never was utilized!
2199 2018-11-15 20:10:59 By that logic all the conservatives in Canada protesting Middle East oil are bigoted against the people from the Middle East
2200 2018-11-15 20:10:59 I shed tears
D thought was bitter
I imagined my sisters in that situation
2201 2018-11-15 20:10:42 Don’t mind not paying the oil man and cutting and splitting five cords of wood to stay warm every winter . I could also grow more produce if summer was extended.

2204 2018-11-15 20:10:38 Maybe you need a change. I’m using sunny isle shampoo, conditioner and hair masque and it’s really good. Then I use chebe butter and growth oil. Hair mayonnaise and dark and lovely leave in conditioner too.
2205 2018-11-15 20:10:35 A 5 year study? Not long enough. Smokers or non? 
What were the quality of the fish oil capsules & vitamin D? High quality low quality? If you stop taking vitamin D you will be so affected by chemtrails that are sprayed on us daily in the United States you'll be very sick. IMO
2206 2018-11-15 20:10:28 @AvonRepDeals @AvonInsider @Avon_UK do any of your products contain palm oil. If they do. What are you doing to replace it? Some of your reps don't seem to know... #conciousconsumer #rangtan #nopalmoilchristmas #checktheingredients #2020toolate
2207 2018-11-15 20:10:27 Hi Carrie. We are currently actively working with suppliers to purchase through a certification program for Palm Oil called the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). We hope this answers your question.
2208 2018-11-15 20:10:22 The resulting mass unemployment was unnecessary and paid-for by what were supposed to be windfall North Sea oil revenues, which were consequentially squandered. And she had the cheek to sanction that "Labour isn't working" poster.

2215 2018-11-15 20:09:47 See the only reason people live there is because oil is there so they have to be whereas these other industries can be set up pretty much anywhere. Without oil who the hell wants to live in Calgary?
2216 2018-11-15 20:09:46 It's one of many stories: palm oil, incinerators, flies, misfeasance, malfeasance and corruption at the highest levels of politics. Unfortunately these stories do not seem to fit the narrative or interests of the individuals sworn into office under oath to regulate such matters.

2219 2018-11-15 20:09:09 But it did. And winter did. And even if it did not stop Wehrmacht at Moscow, do you think the rest of Russia is smaller r more logistics friendly? Top industry always was and is in Ural which is father from Moscow then Moscow is from Berlin. Agriculture - Altay, oil&gas-Siberia.

2221 2018-11-15 20:09:06 The matter tired me
2222 2018-11-15 20:09:04 Oh yeah I should have been more clear in my tweet, sorry! I'm only talking about soybean, canola, corn, and cottonseed oil. All of above oils you mentioned are awesome imo (i'm just not too sure about sunflower oil though, I think the unrefined kind is ok)
2223 2018-11-15 20:09:00 I'm not disputing d fact. In this case of zamfara there is no an @elrufai there the governor seem to be useless. So we're crying out
2224 2018-11-15 20:08:56 Definitely wasn't #3 but I would have definitely fell into group #4. I had plenty of MCT Oil and Butter in my Coffee. And more MCT Oil mixed with my BCAAs.

2246 2018-11-15 20:06:17 Science hasn't failed to prove anthropogenic global warming. The OVERWHELMING consensus among scientists is that global warming is real and contributed to by human carbon emissions.

2260 2018-11-15 20:04:42 With Iceland's Palm Oil stance people seem really hung up on #Nutella containing Palm Oil. My research ie googling suggests that Gu, Waitrose and Hotel Chocolat are your only options for chocolate spread.... #palmoil
2261 2018-11-15 20:04:42 Zamfara has a chief security officer,commissioner of police and even a minister representing d state. Same thing happened in Lagos but it was school children they kidnapped,the governor and the commissioner of police were the ones who made sure those kids were released.

2272 2018-11-15 20:03:22 CBD doesn't just need to be ~legal~ it needs to be available on prescription for everyone. My codeine prescription costs me about £15 a month. CBD oil is more effective for me, but would cost me about £20 a week, which as a disabled person is money i just don't have.

2274 2018-11-15 20:03:06 Wayfair ads claiming free shipments push those costs onto shipper's other customers. Those other customers of the shippers are small businesses (SM) and individuals. It means every other shipper customer's costs goes up. How can startup SB compete? Ckout Standard Oil Trust case
2275 2018-11-15 20:03:03 Stand your ground. 
We need renewable energy jobs, clean water, fertile soil to grow food, clean air, not oil wars or leaky pipelines. 
Unfortunately, there are Dems & Repubs who are lobby owned. 
Get the big oil lobby, oligarch, superpac, foreign agents & foreign lobby money out

2283 2018-11-15 20:01:59 U.S. oil prices end higher, but off session high
2284 2018-11-15 20:01:46 Cdn oil sands make a great fund-raising target. The graphics are big winners (like a forest version of a seal pup) & when it comes to donations, how many in US/EU will donate to a cause against THEIR economy? The targets that are selected for fund raising are not without thought.
2285 2018-11-15 20:01:42 I am curious, you all science folks. Is there a reason we don't do a pipeline not for oil but water. Run east coasts floods to the west. keep things green, less fires. I notice every year one side gets more than the other.
2286 2018-11-15 20:01:37 Gee! Maybe Ontario could wean off its dependance on transfer payments, the auto pact & Saudi oil (all oil related) with a movement to a greener economy. Someone’s been mentioning something about that....
2287 2018-11-15 20:01:35 We have removed it wherever possible and 100% of the palm oil used in M&S products is RSPO certified. Thanks, Donna.
2288 2018-11-15 20:01:27 Hi Tejinder, I've double checked and they do contain palm oil. We're committed to using only the most sustainable sources of palm oil in our products.
2289 2018-11-15 20:01:23 Ejo, I also don't know how these things work. Thought it was because Saudi Arabia signed a deal with Russia to increase output of crude oil, but maybe EFF controls the OPEC countries
2290 2018-11-15 20:01:23 I am sorry to have to buy massive amounts of Oil all over Asia.

2295 2018-11-15 20:00:36 Nonsensical! Inflation is in-check, debt to GDP is in a better spot than most EM's, the oil crash will ease cost pressure and not even to mention really killing the economy by lifting rates. However, US lifts rates so ZAR will suffer...so is someone trying to protect the ZAR?

2300 2018-11-15 20:00:27 People still using coconut oil on their face
2301 2018-11-15 20:00:24 It’s because the saudis have oil. Do you people hear yourselves?

2314 2018-11-15 19:58:37 I like how my phone shoots. I like how your phone shoots. I like that so many people have an easy way to express themselves creatively. I don’t know any other art medium where people fight over their tools. "My charcoal kicks your oil paint’s ass"
2315 2018-11-15 19:58:21 The summer driving season is over, oil prices continue to drop, the U.S. is pushing OPEC not to drop production levels. Exactly what do you have to do with any of these factors? Dam I need a beer.
2316 2018-11-15 19:58:21 So coconut oil doesn't work in the summer because it melts and it freezes in winter. Here on the wet coast any product melts or washes away. Umbrellas are the solution
2317 2018-11-15 19:58:19 Check your dashboard gauges and lights for low oil pressure or maybr its over heating. If anything tighten your gas cap
2318 2018-11-15 19:58:17 The fact that big brands add palm oil to peanut butter is ridiculous. Like we’re chopping down rain forests to add oil to a product that NATURALLY PRODUCES OIL
2319 2018-11-15 19:58:15 wehh i was going to...but my photographer forgot the baby oil.  and the lighting was off. you know how it go! but truee..hella slackinn hahaha

Just because Venezuela has the LARGEST OIL RESERVE in the ENTIRE PLANET and the US wants it. It is CRIMINAL to continue to allow it with IMPUNITY.

2331 2018-11-15 19:56:56 You don't need to compare with @ogundamisi with @MaziNnamdiKanu. Confirm from your boss @GovAyoFayose while in kuje prison kanu was offered oil well, house in Dubai and any choiced place but he refused. So Kanu and Ogundamisi is like heaven n earth.
2332 2018-11-15 19:56:51 Should be the most expensive oil in the world!
2333 2018-11-15 19:56:28 it's all well and good posting about how bad palm oil is but how about actually reading packaging and choosing the products without it
2334 2018-11-15 19:56:24 GIVE ME OIL IN MY LAMP I PRAY..... I PRAY!!!!!
2335 2018-11-15 19:56:23 Find a Walmart auto center. They never tell me anything is wrong with my car. One time I went and got an oil change and my overheated. I tried to blame them but it was a hose that needed replacing  they certainly only do their job 
2336 2018-11-15 19:55:56 One of my ligand preps involves a compound described as a pale yellow oil. Well of course I tried to distill it, and that just turned into a sublimation and now I have the crystal structure of it...
2337 2018-11-15 19:55:49 water for sure.... I can’t do the oil
2338 2018-11-15 19:55:48 Pierre Andurand, one of the #oil market’s most prominent hedge fund managers, suffered his biggest loss last month amid a bloodbath for global crude prices: down 20.9% in October -- full story on @TheTerminal #oott
2339 2018-11-15 19:55:40 Hey there! The certified organic & fair trade palm oil we use in our bar soaps comes from small-holder farms in western Ghana (through our own sister company, Serendipalm)—where oil palms have been grown for centuries; (1)
2340 2018-11-15 19:55:36 おー！ほんとですか(*´▽｀*)やったぜうれしい！！
2341 2018-11-15 19:55:28 Lmao i BEEN on this wave. Do you do the oil or water canned tuna?
2342 2018-11-15 19:55:21 Anyone try CBD oil for their anxiety? I wanna eventually be able to live without the pharmaceutical meds but nervous to try :/
2343 2018-11-15 19:55:18 metric?
and that looks like an oil symbol
2344 2018-11-15 19:55:13 time to get an oil diffuser
2345 2018-11-15 19:54:43 هذا شيعي خبيث مو من اهل جيزان
2346 2018-11-15 19:54:26 U would then need to admit that nuanced comment abt how a community is perceiving ICE, is not the same as saying it's true. If some1 said the U.S. troops in Iraq were being perceived by many as being imperialist there2steal their oil, is NOT accusing our troops of doing that. /3
2347 2018-11-15 19:54:24 You could roast brussel sprouts, carrots, broccoli, and cauliflower and season them with olive oil, basil, pepper, etc. Super easy! I do it with frozen veggies.
2348 2018-11-15 19:54:19 CBD cannabis oil.. Take it! 
2349 2018-11-15 19:54:10 The U.S by every economic metric is booming, Canada should be as well, we need to get Alberta oil to market.
2350 2018-11-15 19:54:04 Whale oil Futures!
2351 2018-11-15 19:54:02 i'm currently defusing my flight of passage oil, blasting killing me softly, and doing homework and I feel so productive. Thought I'd share
2352 2018-11-15 19:53:57 You must be the type of person who feels brave only behind a computer screen but drives a giant ass truck.
2353 2018-11-15 19:53:54 As many of us can only pray and feel pity in these situation, less we forget zamfara has a governor, what has he done or what is he doing to salvage these continued kidnapping, would also advice us to take politics out of this issue of voting or not. We pray for their release
2354 2018-11-15 19:53:49 my car is getting her first oil change and i’ve had 4 diff porters or salesman try to get me in a NEW car?? i just got her in JULY
2355 2018-11-15 19:53:45 We are now carrying this product: Brush Set with Oil
2356 2018-11-15 19:53:37 Maybe so however they are extremely addictive being on these myself as well as other medications I know that any issue you have they just give you a tablet instead of trying to help the issue. My reply wasn’t about wether I think it should be legal or not it was about the CBD oil
2357 2018-11-15 19:53:21 Who is chief security of that state? Don't allow emotion to push to state of stupidity. Vote or you don't vote,Buhari will win.
2358 2018-11-15 19:53:19 We are now carrying this brand of products: Brush Set with Oil
2359 2018-11-15 19:53:12 Ingredients: Organic almond oil, RS palm oil, coconut oil, virgin olive oil, Moroccan argan oil, castor oil, Macadamia nut oil, stearic acid, sea salt, bay laurel oil, kaolin clay, aloe vera, watercress extract, essential oils
2360 2018-11-15 19:53:07 I loved Graze boxes until I realised they contain palm oil. So, not anymore. Just like that.
2361 2018-11-15 19:53:03 No doubt that China is pursuing natural resources everywhere - including in the backyard of the US!  Makes me sick that the phucking Democrats and their enviro-wacko sycophants have stymied oil and gas exploitation in the US for decades now. TNX
2362 2018-11-15 19:52:51 You’d have taken a 1/3rd of the debt with you and the magic North Sea oil price fell like stone
2363 2018-11-15 19:52:45 $75 to register...a bit much!...$30 more i can have park admission, do my own running Lol just no medal 
2364 2018-11-15 19:52:44 Maybe.
Maybe because Yari is the CSO of Zamfara
2365 2018-11-15 19:52:35 Morning-

1 tablespoon Coconut Oil - to break fast

my standard Veggie Drink

Supplements: Milk Thistle, Potassium Citrate, Colostrum

Almond Butter & Peanut Butter with Roasted Matcha, Cinnamon, Nutmeg and Coconut oil

1 glass my Enhanced Energy Water
2366 2018-11-15 19:52:22 The palm oil....
2367 2018-11-15 19:52:21 "Oh, a Stand, that's cool."
"What does it look l-"

"What?!"
"They took all the doujinshi?"

"You might need only mine for that bait."
"People really like blue and white stripes."

"I hope you can fix Japan."
'Has it really got that bad..?'

"...What about the oil and cream?"
2368 2018-11-15 19:52:05 Snake  oil salesman on the White House. Never again evangelicals!
2369 2018-11-15 19:52:03 So proud of ma self today! I'm a big choc and junk food fan. Especially @CadburyUK caramel and flake yogurts...always buy them...not since finding out they don't use sustainable palm oil. I didn't buy anything!
2370 2018-11-15 19:51:53 Morals and Oil companies?
2371 2018-11-15 19:51:46 Follow on.... 
has caused, i believe as chefs and stockists or retailers of products containing palm oil we should be just as aware of where the palm oil is coming from and if it is RSPO certified or not. Just as we would if we were sourcing  meat and fish from local suppliers
2372 2018-11-15 19:51:40 I do actually check labels ALL.THE.TIME and don't buy products with palm oil. And yes, that means we make most things from scratch - but that's better for us and the planet ANYWAY. Peace & love to all!
2373 2018-11-15 19:51:38 • mixing lemon juice and baking soda and brush your teeth with it, will be white af 
• coconut oil, apple cinder vinegar, strawberries or a banana peel wil naturally whiten your teeth 
• mix strawberries with salt and baking soda then brush your teeth for whitening
2374 2018-11-15 19:51:38 I'm definitely teyi g this. I love chickpeas. Got a great tip last week for hummus. If using canned peas boil them for 15 mins first then cool and use as you normally would. Makes it ultra smooth and letting down with ice cold water rather than oil keeps it light.
2375 2018-11-15 19:51:23 What about Russia Oil?
Greenpeace: Canadian Oil will destroy the planet!
What about Iranian Oil?
Greenpeace: We owe it to our children to lock in the oil in Canada!
What about Venezuelan Oil?
Greenpeace: Science denier!
What about oil from Africa?
Greenpeace: You hate the planet!
2376 2018-11-15 19:51:19 I’m oil slick fym
2377 2018-11-15 19:51:17 And what is really annoying with silicone oil, dust and dirt sticks to it and you’ll make your cloths then dirty. Never happens to be with those rubber care sticks.
2378 2018-11-15 19:51:15 3 days since i last washed my hair n its not an oil pit....maybe miracles exist
2379 2018-11-15 19:51:04 Is it? Last time I checked loads of consumers are boycotting products that palm oil in it as it's farming contributes to global warming but please give me..links on this super food gist.
2380 2018-11-15 19:50:49 Based on first hand experience: a blanket that is easy to wash
Second hand: coconut oil
2381 2018-11-15 19:50:45 plenty of marbling so eat them Medium to Well and use cooking oil sparingly.
2382 2018-11-15 19:50:42 Your target of late has certainly been met.  Do you maintain your earlier forecasts of oil below $50.00, or have those projections no longer valid.  Thanks!
2383 2018-11-15 19:50:35 Babe try egg and coconut oil.
2384 2018-11-15 19:50:27 two additional piece of a puzzle. Saudi's are upset at the Iran oil waivers by the Trump admin and want deep cuts to oil production.  Plus the Trump admin added sanctions to the Saudi's over Khashoggi's murder. MBS was not included in sanctions. Is Trump trying to help MBS?
2385 2018-11-15 19:50:26 Down on the road the world is floating by. The poor and undefended left behind. Well, you were somewhere trading lives for oil as if the whole world were blind.
2386 2018-11-15 19:50:25 Yet @JerryPDias says little about other sectors like Automotive or Oil or Metal Fabrication or Forestry that have been impacted by bad Liberal policy, right?
2387 2018-11-15 19:50:23 Mario Badescu, jojoba oil and Hydroboost bought my skin back from the brink of death.
2388 2018-11-15 19:50:01 Yes I know how to put air in my tire, change my oil and not get bamboozled if I have to take my car to the shop.  but no I’m not Fucking doing it. That’s what you crusty lip niggas are for.
2389 2018-11-15 19:49:43 i’m waiting to get my oil changed and i’m bumping music and dancing and everyone is looking at me like i’m an idiot  i’m not an idiot, just having a good time 
2390 2018-11-15 19:49:43 With our current technology.....I totally agree. I think this may not be the case in the future, let's hope so. Otherwise we will all need CBD oil big time! 
2391 2018-11-15 19:49:42 Not to worry. In April of this year, I thought it might be time for my car to have an oil change. I checked the sticker in the car to see when my 90 days were up. They were up in 2016! I lost it after the 2016 election, lost the entire year of 2017, it was just a blur.
2392 2018-11-15 19:49:38 People telling me the issue of #ZamfaraTwins should be addressed to Yari have their phones and data, they can do so, as for me I have addressed it to the CinC if you're bitter come n beat me.
When villages where sacked in Zamfara did Yari do anything? He was in ABJ chilling.
2393 2018-11-15 19:49:37 Better stock up on burt's bees and baby oil gel (for the skin) I about died when I moved to WY last year.
2394 2018-11-15 19:49:30 Only CNBC would run a story about how the President snookered Saudi Arabia to drop oil prices. Your hatred and bias is unreal you actually want people to interpet saving money on gas. and benefiting Americans as bad why & who watches or listens to your twisted version of facts.
2395 2018-11-15 19:49:22 Beef, wheat, milk feed us, lumber houses us. What does oil do? When it spills from pipelines or trains, it destroys the ecosystem. Why does Jason Kenney insist on pursuing fossil fuels to the destruction of the planet when alternatives should be pursued?
2396 2018-11-15 19:49:15 Beard tip (general):
• Coconut oil.

Beard tip (winter):
• When you go outside in the cold, the coconut oil returns to its solid state. I forgot about this. I can't move anything below my eyes. Help me.
2397 2018-11-15 19:49:11 Yes you can, just watch the boil burn when making your roux. Start with room temp pot and veggie oil, mix with flour, then put on stove
2398 2018-11-15 19:49:10 <油botとは永遠のライバルであり、良い友達です
2399 2018-11-15 19:48:59 it'll be interesting to see if they can 100 percent prove the culpability of the oil companies, not to mention how will they handle that, even assuming everything we believe about climate change is true, oil companies are not singularly responsible.
2400 2018-11-15 19:48:54 When it’s nobody at the place... oil change is about to QUICK
2401 2018-11-15 19:48:47 us women are coming for everybody’s neck. by 2020 we ain’t gon be paying nobody for shit! we do our own oil changes, our own nails, our own weaves, our own eyebrows, bitch WE ON!
2402 2018-11-15 19:48:36 lol I traded it a decade ago when oil was going to $200
2403 2018-11-15 19:48:20 I wonder if it’s time for Alberta to think diversification, BC had to do that back in the 80’s and 90’s, it was tough but had to be done and now a single industry won’t shut down our economy.  Imagine what Alberta could be like if oil was the gravy to a robust diverse economy.
2404 2018-11-15 19:48:17 I don’t think any supermarket is palm oil free
2405 2018-11-15 19:48:06 Now we need the same for is.The Oil Refinery Workers.

"YES"???...
     "Please Respond".
2406 2018-11-15 19:48:02 Wow..................................
You do know there are other kinds of oils and plastics, right? I'm not saying completely stop using oil or plastics, but you, of all people, should know that in the long term, the cons outweigh the pros of oil and plastic.
2407 2018-11-15 19:47:47 Where would Norway be without it's huge oil profits? You have to wonder don't ya.
2408 2018-11-15 19:47:46 We need and we need it badly but, they don't let us until we use up to the last drop of oil that  they investing on. I think if we change our lif style,  they will  fallow us.
2409 2018-11-15 19:47:43 Listen. Okay.

I like naked oiled Alexios as much as the next guy. But how is that oil not coagulating on that glorious chest at that temperature?
2410 2018-11-15 19:47:29 I think our resources like oil would get us a vip pass back in.
2411 2018-11-15 19:47:28 Tommi we will use the currency that England will buy the oil , whisky, water , gin , power , fish ect ect off us with ! If it's smackaroonies so fucking be it

2413 2018-11-15 19:46:47 Listen closely, you can almost hear the crackling sound of the vegetable oil from his fries sizzling under his skin
2414 2018-11-15 19:46:43 Spices.

Along with oil, and cream.

"The underwear is for... That too. We're using it to lure a rival group out before we do our final mission."
2415 2018-11-15 19:46:40 Mathew Im not field geologist I work from office finding oil & its possible for geologist with my skill set to work in one location for long time. My mentor worked in Alberta all her life for over 30years. The foreign $ will be spent in another country if things don't improve 
2416 2018-11-15 19:46:36 (Silicon-)oil based lubricants can wash out plasticizers. The rubber elements will be fine, but you might get a negative effect on plastics.
2417 2018-11-15 19:46:26 BRO PUT SOME COCONUT OIL ON YA FACE. IT'LL FEEL LIKE A DREAM.
2418 2018-11-15 19:46:25 O and O meaning Ocean and Oil
2419 2018-11-15 19:46:03 Full spectrum CBD? Or snake oil 
2420 2018-11-15 19:46:02 Our oil price crisis has not recovered as yet. This is the longest we have sugared thru all this job loss. Reminds me of the '80s. Seems like we are doomed.
2421 2018-11-15 19:45:51 I was supposed to get my oil changed today  yup I think not
2422 2018-11-15 19:45:50 Polish will stop the dubbin penetrating. Polish on its own is good for caring for leather but will need doing regularly, daily if raining. I too use ledergris. The other excellent option is neatsfoot oil, available from country stores.
2423 2018-11-15 19:45:43 Nah. Dudes trying to cook biodiesel or power their cars with heated veggie oil were stealing the grease.
2424 2018-11-15 19:45:43 Interesting observations but I think you are confusing/conflating various concepts. Sovereignty is not omnipotence. A state that has no need to borrow is relatively free to default. A state that is self-sufficient in oil is relative detached from oil price swings.
2425 2018-11-15 19:45:38 I have been taking @USANAinc products for almost 14 years and notice a difference in how I feel each day.  Are you looking for a multi vitamin?  fish oil?
2426 2018-11-15 19:45:32 While true. Gotta give the engine a chance to circulate the oil. That's the warm up he referring to. Like 90 seconds type shit.
2427 2018-11-15 19:45:31 Most houses have a vent system in basement or garage so noise isnt a big concern for them. 

In an apt. unit it is a bit more tricky but you can still do with undervolting, oil, etc.
2428 2018-11-15 19:45:25 ten rules for making scrambled eggs perfectly: 
1. medium to low heat
2. i like to use olive oil but butter is also ok
3. scramble the eggs in the pan, better mixture of texture/color
4-10. eat the eggs and also there's no perfect way to do anything in life except Make Eggs.
2429 2018-11-15 19:45:18 So far in 2018, U.S. motorists have spent somewhere in the ballpark of $49 billion more on gasoline versus last year. Today's bill will be $35m higher than a year ago today. #gasprices #oil
2430 2018-11-15 19:45:17 tied to glut of VC money tied to influx of LPs w funds tied to recent gains fr oil drilling, real estate, mining...?
2431 2018-11-15 19:45:10 Koskinen fooled me as an islanders fan a few years back but seems better able to sustain success now. I still think the Oil have a better chance with Talbot long term. But I'm am an Islanders fan so what do I know
2432 2018-11-15 19:45:06 @chemicalbrodar 
May your oil never run dry!
Keep retweeting those beautiful babes to my TL. 

A king. 
2433 2018-11-15 19:44:59 Dashing through the snow, in an all wheel drive a6, oil light is on, but it can suck a dick
2434 2018-11-15 19:44:50 @realDonaldTrump Try this put sanction on Saudi Arabia and Make peace with Canada and Latin America and Form OIL AMERICAS 
FROM THE NORTH OF CANADA TO TIP OF BRAZIL THERE MORE OIL THAN BOTH RUSSIA AND MID EAST  .
2435 2018-11-15 19:44:49 Unbelievable. Yeah I know the Saudis have oil and we want to sell them weapons, right? #YemenGenocide
2436 2018-11-15 19:44:43 it smells like canola oil and rancid hamburger meat.
2437 2018-11-15 19:44:39 Magnesium spray. Look up a magnesium oil recipe.
2438 2018-11-15 19:44:37 A boy needs his oil changed Jackie
2439 2018-11-15 19:44:36 The Best & Honest CBD Oil (CANNABIDIOL) has finally arrived on Cap Cod. A safe, natural compound from Hemp. Not psychoactive, not illegal, but very healthful. Extracted with no chemical-based gasses such as butane. #Provincetown #Truro #Wellfleet #Eastham #Orleans
2440 2018-11-15 19:44:18 Kerosene is an oil that floats on water.. hence water should not be used in these type of fires

Still disappointed in CVS.. how could they miss such a basic thing
2441 2018-11-15 19:44:13 New year new me. I think I'll be starting the esstential oil life so if anyone wants to start getting new doTERRA oils or a diffuser you'd help a ton lol
2442 2018-11-15 19:44:10 EPIC grape juice olive oil victorias secret perfume i want henry will i want henry to die uhnf he y guys its me moan i want
2443 2018-11-15 19:44:08 Y’a pas que les entreprises misent en faute, les voitures électriques sont une mauvaises choses, les voitures à oil sont mauvaises
2444 2018-11-15 19:43:58 Which plant oils were you ranting about? Genuinely curious as I mostly use plant oils. Coconut oil? Black seed oil? Sunflower oil? Almond oil? OK I've just named all the oils in my flat (along with olive)
2445 2018-11-15 19:43:55 snake oil buy with bitch cash .  ohh its bitcoin cash

2449 2018-11-15 19:43:36 The cure for cancer has existed since the 1920's. But Scott its about the $$$$. Healthy ppl DON'T generate $$$, sick ppl do! 10 viles of marijuana oil would cost normal consumer roughly $60k per vile under Big PHARMA and your hands! NOT acceptable! 
2450 2018-11-15 19:43:35 yep and no one guessed.
I had a brother then..I now have an Uncle.
2451 2018-11-15 19:43:32 FYI—ask Iowa how respected this snake oil salesman iscame in 4th (!) in a state treasurers race which a well trained dog could have won
2452 2018-11-15 19:43:31 Don't bother about last years Govt surplus. That is trailer of previous Govt. Look ahead to likely consequences of foolish, ideology driven actions. Banning oil and gas exploration is the biggie.
2453 2018-11-15 19:43:30 Scotland certainly not mentioned once in this article either!
Funny how oil is supposedly a burden for Scotland but a benefit to UK! #ScottishOil
2454 2018-11-15 19:43:22 Yesterday someone hit me with their horse. After 300 corpses, a 2 hour hijacked train ride, 4 angry crocs slain and enough snake oil to drown a child ... I actually started a mission.
2455 2018-11-15 19:43:21 Limp uptick for #oil benchmarks but over-correction doesn't appear on cards at the moment - #WTI at $56.60/bbl (+0.62%), #Brent at $66.76/bbl (+0.97%) #OOTT #oilandgas
2456 2018-11-15 19:43:16 They are dismantling the oil pump on property next to us!!!  We are next...... yeah!!!
2457 2018-11-15 19:43:15 Only thing I hate about Bluetooth connecting my phone to my car is when I get an oil change they hear whatever music I was jammin hardddddd to.
2458 2018-11-15 19:43:15 broccoli and carrots can be roasted ~400F ~45min with just olive oil, garlic, and lemon juice, and they're pretty damn nice. i like oyster sauce on sauteed veggies, but idk if oyster sauce is like...an ok ingredient to use?
2459 2018-11-15 19:43:01 Most of frying oil we use here is palm oil, what's the best substitute for that?
2460 2018-11-15 19:42:47 To be completely honest, I'm super-concerned about Burlingame in particular.  They're wetter than most, but it only takes one flame in the right spot to light the literally explosive, filled with flammable oil eucalyptus trees on fire

2461 2018-11-15 19:42:47 Do better research, oil is used a lot of other ways.
2462 2018-11-15 19:42:42 England will be wanting oil and all that fish and whisky and beef and water and electricity as they don’t have enough - remember the brexit argument about Germany and BMW
2463 2018-11-15 19:42:35 Too bad Big Oil and their paid-off puppets in the US government have fought renewable energy to the point of extinction (ours)
2464 2018-11-15 19:42:34 Have you checked these 7 fluids lately?  Oil, radiator fluid, transmission fluid, power steering fluid, brake fluid, air conditioning coolant, and your washer fluid?  #atomicauto #vehiclemaintenance #yxe

2466 2018-11-15 19:42:21 I hope that bag on your head is made from oil and gas by-products, and it fits real tight.
2467 2018-11-15 19:42:17 Why? When Palm Oil is starting to gain a reputation as a superfood?

2497 2018-11-15 19:39:27 Silly Melly. Don’t you understand that it’s the weapons and oil Trump is concerned about. Not ridiculous human rights and illegal acts being brought to justice. Been 2 years with this clown, same shit different day.
2498 2018-11-15 19:39:25 Yes and I was Newchurch.
2499 2018-11-15 19:39:03 It's typically not higher oil prices themselves that cause a recession...but energy consumption/inflation rises toward the end of economic cycles, when the central bank is raising interest rates. Higher inflation leads to higher interest rates, which eventually ends the cycle.

2505 2018-11-15 19:38:49 Hydrogen is clean and hydrogen can be made cleanly although trust me they're going to make it from oil because they have a lot of oil and oil is ultimately mostly hydrogen which is why it's called hydrocarbons :-) the problem is it's not good for the consumer because it's high

2507 2018-11-15 19:38:41 CBD oil is absolutely life changing and I would recommend it to anyone dealing with any level of anxiety/stresses. Can't believe this stuff isn't more talked about.
2508 2018-11-15 19:38:31 Leave the oil, gas, coal in the ground. Shut down the fossil fuel industry.
2509 2018-11-15 19:38:24 @HSBC I see you have major investments in palm oil. Are you taking any steps to end this?

2520 2018-11-15 19:37:46 When there is no rational explanation for adopting a course of action. 'Because it is the right thing to do' How many times have we heard that recently. Pike River. Oil and Gas. Will we hear it about refugees?

2522 2018-11-15 19:37:40 Sure I have been through 3 of the down cycles in my carrier this is the worst one with no end in sight if government doesn't do something soon we will have no oil industry left. That will hurt entire Canada, not just Alberta.

2526 2018-11-15 19:37:10 Men are idiots. But they probably think we are too  like you may think he’s dumb for not getting the right milk at the store but he thinks you’re dumb for not keeping up with your oil change. Balance. We need each other

2529 2018-11-15 19:36:52 That's absolutely true. Artificial banana flavor (as well as things that use banana oil) are awful.

2532 2018-11-15 19:36:39 A long time ago, Honda built a Civic with a Hydrogen powered internal combustion motor that was totally pollution free! It only emitted water vapor from its exhaust! Of course that never got off the ground because there's too much money being made in oil!
2533 2018-11-15 19:36:36 I made a sort of stuffing with whizzed up shallot, parsley and olive oil, then wrapped in pancetta and cooked on tato slices and skinned cherry tomatoes, thyme and olive oil.

2537 2018-11-15 19:36:01 So, since most chocolate/lemon/french silk pies are made with cool whip (coconut oil), my pie choices boils down to pumpkin, blueberry, or sweet potato, but let's be honest- no one is making blueberry pies.

2544 2018-11-15 19:35:16 How is the draining of the swamp coming @realDonaldTrFan - seems like your filled the swamp to the limits and now the swamp is overflowing with pollution, oil, and disasters
2545 2018-11-15 19:35:02 These are good points but my overarching issue is the Pod Save guys (speaking of white men) portray themselves as an antithesis to the corruption of Washington. Hiring a guy who does oppo for oil and pharma cos (let alone antisemitic hit pieces) is bad!
2546 2018-11-15 19:34:56 Can't be any sadder than all the greed & mind control, when I can walk to a local dispensary without this online confusion. Grocery store is full of canola oil & don't buy it from greedy or online using the flip app.
2547 2018-11-15 19:34:48 It will never be 100% because they can't handle that much heavy oil.

2553 2018-11-15 19:34:23 Obama said “SS will end soon”
obama was shutting down industries around the country, in Wyoming thousands were fired from oil & energy industries after obama/hillary attacked.

SS and Medicare for seniors will never end IF all young people have a job.
Pres. Trump is working on it

2556 2018-11-15 19:34:11 , or that provides energy subsidies to their people. As Sullivan underlined, US tight oil cannot be antidote to oil price volatility because changes in tight oil production emerges only as a result of change in price.

2561 2018-11-15 19:33:59 I don’t disagree about oil companies’ motivation. But I’m sure LNG is not all three - better, as bad as, and worse than coal. It’s only one of the three. And knowing which one is the starting point to a rational position.
2562 2018-11-15 19:33:59 @Tesco I don’t make a habit of complaining but we brought some of your fish cakes this morning and have gone to cook them this evening.

2563 2018-11-15 19:33:57 by then the oil will run out
2564 2018-11-15 19:33:49 International law dictates Shetland would be an enclave within Scottish waters. The oil will fall to Scotland, not Shetland. But it's academic, Shetland doesn't want Indy from Scotland.

2571 2018-11-15 19:33:06 @CadburyUK  I never ever ate any brands of chocolate apart fro cyber dairymilk chocolate, it is very upsetting to discover that you have palm oil in your products. How could such a huge company do that a minimum of 25 orangutans due to the growth of Palm oil. #PalmOilFree
2572 2018-11-15 19:33:05 What a joke. How much oil have they used keeping the cars on the lot. They built a bunch of service centers and didn’t think to build chargers into the lots. Plus when they need a reliable care they go to ford. You can’t make it up.

2597 2018-11-15 19:30:14 Today's lunch slice is The Cabrini: Thin crust, Olive Oil, a bit of Tomato Sauce, Smoked Mozzarella, Fresh Italian Sausage, Red Peppers! #DinosForLunch #pizza
2598 2018-11-15 19:30:13 Good. Pipelines are a form of job killing automation. Oil workers who support them are unwittingly selling out their own jobs to a bunch of tubes, making sure their American investor employers can keep even more profit for themselves #cdnpoli
2599 2018-11-15 19:30:07 Since when is exporting oil a bad thing can you say social services

2601 2018-11-15 19:30:00 Stanley Druckenmiller graduated in 1975 and opened a hot dog stand with his friend. He joined as an oil analyst at Pittsburgh National Bank in 1977 as management trainee. In 1978, he became Head of Equity Research.

What the hell did I just read?!
2602 2018-11-15 19:29:59 Heavy rains have cancelled the Joe Lee Johnson Memorial / Gobbler race scheduled for this Saturday Nov. 17th at Boyd's Speedway which was scheduled to Feature the Iron-Man Open Wheel Modifieds and SNBS Late Models. This ends the 2018 Schaeffer's Oil SNBS season.
2603 2018-11-15 19:29:51 What a day in world economy and politics. #Brexit stealing the show causing exchange rate market commotion. Oil continues its drop. There is no feeling of ease at all. I just hope sanity prevails in UK and people of that country feel protected and secure again
2604 2018-11-15 19:29:42 Baby oil, just pure flesh and baby oil 
2605 2018-11-15 19:29:23 Being an adult means getting extra excited about buying a humidifier that ALSO has an essential oil feature 
2606 2018-11-15 19:29:16 Do you supply any products with wheat or potatoes in where there used to be forest (I.e. all of
Europe)? Going overboard on this palm oil hipster thing ain’t you? Wonder why? 
2607 2018-11-15 19:29:10 The only reason you guys are writing negative articles about Tesla is your Sponsors are all fossil fuel friends. Tesla Will Survive. How can the big oil/big corporations kill a vision??? Go write about Ford and Saudi Arabia hegemony on western countries reliance on fossil energy.
2608 2018-11-15 19:29:07 don't feel like driving to cypress for this damn oil change 
2609 2018-11-15 19:28:54 Wow I made it home and my tires aren’t as bad as I thought they were... my baby done earned herself an oil change. 
2610 2018-11-15 19:28:54 What a stupid comment - Oil and Gas allows all of Canada to have one of the highest standards of living in the world and funds healthcare #drdumbdumb
2611 2018-11-15 19:28:41 I love this chart.  I have been saying this for years.  People were relating them to oil prices, but they could not provide a theory that explains their view.
2612 2018-11-15 19:28:40 Dear Joanna, I use this opportunity to appreciate your work in the food sector. Please, I am Martin and I am into groundnut oil processing in Nigeria. I have a serious challenge of how to remove the taste and the odour. I need your guidance on to handle these issues  @JoannaKP

2615 2018-11-15 19:28:33 Oil cunts 
2616 2018-11-15 19:28:32 I would assume that given a choice between stable oilöprices at $65 a barrel vs. a constantly fluctuating price between $65 and $100, many oil producers would opt for the first. As stated by @OSullivanMeghan in her recent book “Windfall”,  volatility complicates decision-making +
2617 2018-11-15 19:28:31 Cooking in a big kitchen today! Beet noodles with feta and garbanzo beans, cranberry juice glazed carrots with toasted sesame and sautéed green apple in coconut oil with cinnamon nutmeg lemon and pinch of brown sugar.
2618 2018-11-15 19:28:22 It’s common in general, at least as a guest you’re not going to instinctively reach for the olive oil, like soap or a hand towel.
2619 2018-11-15 19:28:19 I am reminded of @JeffRubin 's fine writings on the subject of triple-digit oil prices and why they will never come to be.
2620 2018-11-15 19:28:14 It really doesn’t matter if they say it’s running out or not the important thing is that the licences for the sectors are out of our hands, only the other week Equinor the Norwegian state oil company purchased 40% of a field in Shetlands
2621 2018-11-15 19:28:00 Because of the total lack of similarity to any of the Standard Oil cartoons, and the remarkable abundance of similarity to the multitude of Jewish conspiracy cartoons with an octopus sitting atop the globe.
2622 2018-11-15 19:27:56 He did not say that, during 04-10 capital goods import was more than that of Oil
2623 2018-11-15 19:27:44 Cz it ain't happening, has too much oil to drain

2626 2018-11-15 19:27:35 Can't wait for Congress ask Zinke what he's up to with FEDERAL LANDS and OIL & GAS companies?
2627 2018-11-15 19:27:34 Went for Turkey,just googled it and It's right.Oil is not everything!!!
2628 2018-11-15 19:27:31 @TEENASkincare is there palm oil in the product??
2629 2018-11-15 19:27:29 Do your robots take bribes to ship mine first? Are they more we want oil or we want booze like Bender? 
2630 2018-11-15 19:27:15 Yes, there are occasional spills (every industry has negative & positive impact) but pipeline is still the safest way to transport oil. We are using it and will continue to do so for forseable future so why not do it safely with economic upside?
2631 2018-11-15 19:26:48 For the same price as a Starbucks latte, you can purchase a barrel of Western Select oil.

That's a deal if I've ever heard one!

2632 2018-11-15 19:26:40 Omg..the people here at jiffy lube waiting to get their oil changed ar efucking impatient..like its busy here and they automatically start bitching about the wait
2633 2018-11-15 19:26:33 You can't afford it unless you have a high paying oilfield job. But with that comes higher crime too.Oil and Gas is a roller coaster business. Every time the oil goes below $40 barrel, they start slowing down and laying off people. Always worse in the years Dems are in charge.
2634 2018-11-15 19:26:31 sound's interesting-U.S. 1970's-you could still buy a 1962 Dodge for $100 and get a couple year's out of it--An oil seal here--a valve job there--and you were all set-

2637 2018-11-15 19:26:09 Completely agree, Jackie. He should work on an oil rig. A sunken one.
2638 2018-11-15 19:26:07 How much oil does $tsla purchase per year? I’ve been seeing a lot of none ev cars and trucks used in their logistics. Shout out to shorty Air and Ground. The cars are recharged by fossil at some lots. Given the stated mission Tesla should disclose their fossil consumption. $tslaq
2639 2018-11-15 19:26:05 So i Can take my car for the oil sensor?
2640 2018-11-15 19:25:59 My idea of heaven Lee, is a winery that also makes olive oil and I can do 2 tastings! #ukwinehour
2641 2018-11-15 19:25:47 At a car shop trying to get my oil changed and the guy in front of me and the guy behind the desk are making innuendos about wildsheild wiper lengths and I dont know how to even process life
2642 2018-11-15 19:25:44 I told Taylor to go get olive oil, while I’ll go get eggs, he comes back and says “babe they don’t have olive oil, all they have is extra Virgin Olive oil”  lmao

2646 2018-11-15 19:25:21 For every right-wing, racist, conspiracy theorist, there is a left-wing, shamanic healer, essential oil, MLM salesperson.

Anti-intellectualism is a disease that doesn't stick to one ideology.
2647 2018-11-15 19:25:07 In one week from right now my turkey will be loaded with creole butter and dropped into hot peanut oil … I can’t wait.
2648 2018-11-15 19:24:58 Yes again how many bailouts is that? Tax payer money paying to bailout this company.... Meanwhile they let good companies like Nortel sink.... and the oil companies suffer..
2649 2018-11-15 19:24:57 I see $55 oil by December
2650 2018-11-15 19:24:54 you cannot beat Dickies for work ware am in the oil industry
2651 2018-11-15 19:24:47 No, it's counter-intuitive to raise that money from corporations, who always have strings attached to those fuckin donations.

Nancy isn't raising money from the ppl, she's getting it from oil and banking execs, pharma companies and military contractors. She's a sellout.
2652 2018-11-15 19:24:43 Chamomile tea and some lavender essential oil under your pillow might help.
2653 2018-11-15 19:24:34 Some girls cannot wait for 3 years for a fresh graduate to get a job, but they can wait 12 years for a guy in America to come back. Sister, your deliverance needs 7 bottles of anointing oil
2654 2018-11-15 19:24:30 Trump, this week,  tweeted to Saudi Arabia and OPEC to produce more oil because prices in the USA are too high.   If we are independent, why aren't our prices dropping?
2655 2018-11-15 19:24:27 @AccidentalP According to Popbitch, Noel Edmonds has had a 20,000 gallon tank of oil fitted at his home in anticipation of the world's supply running dry. He tells people he'll have "two years of clear motoring ahead of him" when it happens.  Textbook Partridge!
2656 2018-11-15 19:24:23 CBD oil, peppermint oil and lavender put it in your show and take a hot shower, also ice packs help.
2657 2018-11-15 19:24:20 You’re telling me thousands of scientists are a part of a huge conspiracy to overthrow “big oil” and the small faction that denies climate change is right? Come on. Use some common sense. Scientists have nothing to gain from this. Open your eyes.
2658 2018-11-15 19:24:17 Need a fake bf to come with me to get my oil changes cause they be tryna finaggle & finesse me

2663 2018-11-15 19:23:45 Really? 
The day I fried banana. It soaked  the oil and was very soft. 
I could not even eat i because it felt like I was eating hot oil
2664 2018-11-15 19:23:42 I did my research. In this instance they're not wrong but they're also not right if that makes sense. It's an issue with their engine and pistons that causes over consumption of oil. The cause of it is aggressive driving and *not letting the car sit idle before driving*
2665 2018-11-15 19:23:41 If they started from 1955 when USA fist used a energy panel and worked then to renewable energy.  We would not be in the mess we are in now. But no they prefered the Oil. Shameful to all that did nothing then and still do nothing and we are paying the price.
2666 2018-11-15 19:23:34 How not? He wanted all of Saudi Arabia’s oil, go to war with them take their oil. Only thing missing was a reason.

2668 2018-11-15 19:23:24 @KatyTurNBC 4) is hampered by our increased oil industry which had encroached into our public lands. Liz does not care about the future: she cares about getting as much for her while she inhabits space on this planet. She is a climate denier despite all scientific evidence.
2669 2018-11-15 19:23:22 As soon as we recognize Hebrew Biafra the origin of most Black Americans, the British Edomite Govt and their jihadists  terrorists activities will stop. There will be no more oil and gas to steal. REFERENDUM. TRUTH is SUPREME.
2670 2018-11-15 19:23:20 6. The drive of agriculture, of steam power, of coal, of oil, of mercantile steam ships, and of nuclear was always:
Power
Control
Mobility
Political
Military
Territorial
 and weren't economically, ecologically or otherwise efficient/sustainable.
2671 2018-11-15 19:23:19 The next oil bust will coincide with a boom in renewable, long term they simply won't need as much crude so they won't need oil allies
2672 2018-11-15 19:22:53 UK used to be covered in forests with boar, wolf, lynx, bear, beaver etc. Then came wheat, barley and potatoes. What’s difference between that and chopping down trees to grow palm oil.
2673 2018-11-15 19:22:52 I need to get an oil change before my light come on. I hate shitting for that tho
2674 2018-11-15 19:22:47 I did a varietal olive oil tasting with Zuccardi in Argentina...it was nearly as much fun as the wine tasting... #ukwinehour
2675 2018-11-15 19:22:43 You should sell model 3 futures hahahahaha that’ll give oil a kick in the butt
2676 2018-11-15 19:22:40 I don’t have a problem with straw wrappers, only because I always save them to blow at my littlest dog Olive Oil. She like to chase/catch the wrappers and then eat them

2678 2018-11-15 19:22:29 Coconut oil or hit up the Body Shop for some moisturizer
2679 2018-11-15 19:22:27 Also, oil is a trillion dollar industry with everything to lose by us switching to cheap & renewable energy. They’re the ones feeding you bullshit. All the research denying climate change are paid for by big oil. You’re the blind one.
2680 2018-11-15 19:22:21 sorry to hear that! Try a small drop of oil behind the metal rivet. Should quiet it right up!
2681 2018-11-15 19:22:19 obama sent feds to confiscate lands to close MEAT indus. Abbott/Cruz sent sheriffs to defend ranchers

obama tried to close TX OIL Bus. Abbott/Cruz defended Texas

Abbott/Cruz fought 60 counries & WON,  countries didn’t want America to punish men that raped/killed 2 Texas girls

2685 2018-11-15 19:22:10 5. The adoption of agriculture, as well as the adoption of steam power, coal, oil & nuclear were, at their beginnings, all net losses. All of them led to declines in efficiency, both relative & absolute, and sometimes for millennia (as with agriculture)
2686 2018-11-15 19:22:04 Believe your own BS.  Facts speak for themselves.  What good is a government that destroys hospitals, minimizes Heath care, builds no infrastructure, gave little to education..... but oil companies got rich on Albertans backs - peanuts in Heritage Fund.
2687 2018-11-15 19:22:02 Beard oil
2688 2018-11-15 19:22:01 Its funny how our Justins gang can virtue signal Saudis yet still buy their oil, and simultaneously destroy canadas own oil resources! Its so ridiculous the only answer is that there are other motives behind this that are far more sinister than virtue signalling.
2689 2018-11-15 19:22:00 There are soo many antisemitic tropes, I personally didn't know the octopus one but knew Standard Oil bc I had to take US History SATs. Your experience might be different, I guess those protestors didn't know it either. They state that they thought of Standard Oil.
2690 2018-11-15 19:21:50 the guy telling me things that he did to my car : “i did this and i put this on that and i did this other thing to the oil pan “ & sum other shit probably

2691 2018-11-15 19:21:44 I have frankincense oil on my wrist and my cat won’t stop smelling it and trying to lick it ergo my cat is clearly the second coming of Christ. We will accept gifts on December 25th in the form of PayPal deposits thank you.
2692 2018-11-15 19:21:37 - Agree 100%. MbS' role must be exposed.
- US doesn't need Saudi oil. 
In US hand, however, control of ME oil has been like a non-lethal WMD, that can be used, if/when needed, against big oil importing rivals (China, India, Japan, EU...).

2693 2018-11-15 19:21:36 just a reminder that essential oils and the oil diffusers can be toxic to animals!! even if they’re not directly near them!!

2704 2018-11-15 19:20:29 The AMMODOGS’ (0-10) opponents have averaged 164.61 points per game, which would be an OIL record. To set the record, his final three opponents must average 151.42 ppg, but those teams are only averaging 136.8 ppg.

2708 2018-11-15 19:20:00 You’re right. It’s not like there are entire generations that will have to deal with the stuff we’ve caused. Let’s just keep raping the planet. The stuff we’re using now will never run out because there’s an infinite amount of oil. Fuck it.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2709 2018-11-15 19:19:57 These 2 video are 2 different cooling thing one is using close enclosure with novec 7000 and the other is using mineral oil with pump system in open environnement, thing to ba careful is that some component don’t support pressure like capacitor in the first case.
2710 2018-11-15 19:19:54 I love how people are shocked by this.  I just assume this happens all the time there.  I mean this is a country that regularly executes people for imagined slights.  Oh but they have oil money so everyone looks the other way ...
2711 2018-11-15 19:19:36 green energy is a fantasy, not ready just like Trudeau, oil will be the primary for many years to come, Canada one of the lowest emitters and 3rd largest oil reserves in the world, currently selling oil at a large discount, get busy and build some pipelines
2712 2018-11-15 19:19:36 Olive oil + Rosemary Oil = Blessings to your skin  Vitamin E helps with collagen in your skin, and rosemary oil is WONDERFUL to acne.
2713 2018-11-15 19:19:27 If we would have taken the oil, you wouldn't have ISIS.

2720 2018-11-15 19:18:56 Absolutely loving how many people are talking about palm oil, how bad it is for the planet and animals etc... now imagine that on a much larger scale, and you have animal agriculture. You alone can make a huge difference when it comes to what's on your plate.

2722 2018-11-15 19:18:44 Except that narrative is bullshit. There's a fundamental difference between depicting a non-human company as an octopus and depicting persons as such. The Standard Oil octopus is also not "very widely known", especially when compared with the trope associated with antisemitism.
2723 2018-11-15 19:18:31 I don't understand please. Somebody should pour olive oil inside my brain
2724 2018-11-15 19:18:14 I would rather alberta separate and work closer with the usa.  
We could sell a fraction of the oil and be better off financially.

2729 2018-11-15 19:17:30 To be fair to iceland, it should put more pressure on companies to source more sustainable palm oil so it's not all awful
2730 2018-11-15 19:17:28 When I search Pam on google, the first images that come up are Olive Oil and @jennafischer 
2731 2018-11-15 19:17:27 Just randomly put on lip oil cz it makes me feel good . Uni shall not come and kill me

2734 2018-11-15 19:16:58 I was told to do oil last as a kind of seal for ur moisturizer
2735 2018-11-15 19:16:46 Next verse: thou anointest my head with oil (not water)....
2736 2018-11-15 19:16:35 I would like to see progress yeah. Be nice to have sources of energy for the long-term that don’t poison the air when used, or poison the land and the water when acquired. I doubt that the oil corps will actually innovate in any meaningful way with just free market pressure.
2737 2018-11-15 19:16:32 Why can we take used cooking oil and spray the fence?
2738 2018-11-15 19:16:25 No palm oil good.  Plastic films bad.

2741 2018-11-15 19:15:49 Is there any palm oil in it? Or palm oil by another name? #PalmOil
2742 2018-11-15 19:15:44 Thank u very much. Greatly appreciated.
2743 2018-11-15 19:15:39 Interesting to hear former “Big Oil” execs talk about energy sustainability. Our global energy system is a multi-variate system with politics as a major influencer - for better or worse. @geography2050
2744 2018-11-15 19:15:39 That’s the worse!!! I buy Oil of Oregano. Put a drop under yr tongue a few times a day!! Drink it if u can!! I really works esp for colds!!!
2745 2018-11-15 19:15:37 I worked in Yemen for months for 2 different Oil and Gas companies for Y2K SCADA upgrades.  The Yemeni are beautiful people whom I worked with, shared meals with, and laughed with. They just want the same as us - love, family, friends, kids do better. This is a crime we abet.
2746 2018-11-15 19:15:35 Love it, only when I drain all the oil
2747 2018-11-15 19:15:18 Proof again that you understand very little about how politics works, both Brexit secretaries we're clearly kept out of the snake oil meetings hence the resignation of both but don't worry traitor May is still aiming to kill off Brexit.
2748 2018-11-15 19:15:16 there's no such thing as a gas shortage man, its all set up by the government, everything's controlled by the oil companies like I heard about this guy who invented a car that runs on water man, its fiberglass, air cooled and it runs on water!
2749 2018-11-15 19:15:15 Ok sir, let me make the correction, nevertheless I will keep my promise.
2750 2018-11-15 19:15:08 Whatever or governments do,we should insist on accountability for Khashoggi’s murder.

It is worth noting that we are less dependent on Saudi oil than we were.
2751 2018-11-15 19:15:07 Palm oil in oreos!!!!
2752 2018-11-15 19:15:07 I do it weekly. I’d sometimes do it Saturday night and then let it sit most of Sunday then wash it out. I then put Moroccan oil in my clean wet hair and then blow dry it
2753 2018-11-15 19:15:00 Hakan ma may Allah reward u abundantly
2754 2018-11-15 19:15:00 What do you do for a living? 
   
It’s always fun to see what all my friends do. 
I work from my cell phone selling Pure Full Spectrum C.B.D. Oil 
2755 2018-11-15 19:14:53 And before someone goes OOOOOOH BUT YOU NUKE YOUR ENEMY IN FALLOUT 1 AND 2, the nukes in those games were contextualized and their placement wasn't out of context. Seeing a *secured* nuke lying in both the LA vault and Poseidon Oil rig made you feel uneasy and endangered.

2757 2018-11-15 19:14:27 I am very PRO CBD oil - a full spectrum CBD oil has so many benefits. On the other hand smoking marijuana can lead to poor lung health. Any type of inhaling smoke whether cigarettes, vaping or marijuana is NOT good for lung health. Make the transition go a full spectrum CBD oil.
2758 2018-11-15 19:14:23 Lada ameen
2759 2018-11-15 19:14:22 You should try Young Living's Stress Away essential oil blend - it's amazing!
2760 2018-11-15 19:14:20 If this were a right wing group I'd totally agree! But firms like Tim's do a lot of work for major corps too. Oil cos, big pharma, and tech cos ask for this kind of research all the time, and make terrible misleading press, but they don't go full on racist garbage...
2761 2018-11-15 19:14:11 Son I just got an oil change for $8

2764 2018-11-15 19:13:43 @AldiUK palm oil is in your frozen duck fat roast potatoes & your frozen honey roast parsnips. #disappointed I won’t buy them again or any other products that contain palm oil. Please replace palm oil with alternative sustainable oil. #bemoreiceland @IcelandFoods #PalmOilfree
2765 2018-11-15 19:13:40 Dang are those high heels or are you prospecting for oil?
2766 2018-11-15 19:13:39 Climate change is caused by burning fossil fuels, deforestation & industrial agriculture. Humans are adding CO2 & CH4 to the atmosphere from the use of oil, coal & gas, raising cattle, cutting down primary forests, & ag practices that degrade the soil, it's not a conspiracy.
2767 2018-11-15 19:13:29 Oil of Oregano, or: what I imagine licking an Italian man’s balls that are strapped to a car battery must be like

2771 2018-11-15 19:13:12 Frankie and bennys cook their ‘vegan’ nuggets in the same oil as their chicken ones heads up vegan ppl

2775 2018-11-15 19:12:40 I'm now almost certain that Montreal's traffic flow has been designed by big oil companies. It's driving me mad.
2776 2018-11-15 19:12:40 Infrastructure.  It’s the no 1 issue facing the oil and gas sector. We really need to solve the infrastructure deficit to make US energy more competitive on the global market. @USEnergyAssn @CanaryConnects
2777 2018-11-15 19:12:39 Lol. I pledged N100,000(one hundred thousand naija only) not N10,000,000(ten million Naira). If I could I swear by Allah, I would pay the entire ransom without a second’s hesitation.

2779 2018-11-15 19:12:28 I've had an oil down with like 3-4 different meats. I can still taste it
2780 2018-11-15 19:12:24 not water, is mineral oil
2781 2018-11-15 19:12:18 For what? I'm not the one trying to fix oil and water. A GE is only forum to fix the immigration issue for non-European union citizens.
2782 2018-11-15 19:12:16 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output

2785 2018-11-15 19:12:04 They did...I sold loads of Micras. Datsun/Nissan were light years ahead of BL. Quality was incredible. No sqeaks, rattles, oil leaks. Every car perfect. Went great too.
2786 2018-11-15 19:12:03 Ask Husky what the price is for dumping oil in the North Saskatchewan River. #skpoli
2787 2018-11-15 19:11:57 holy fackkkk nobody mentions how expensive maintaining a car is.  winter tires, alignment, oil change, gas, insurance & registration payments, motha fucking windshield wash! Fuck man. #backtowalking #jk #butfuckman
2788 2018-11-15 19:11:52 If 9/11 couldn't punish SaudiA, the assassination of JK will not.
The secret? Oil.
When is US protection of al-Sauds likely to end?
2030/2040: Most big oil importing countries will stop selling petrol cars.
~2/3 rd. of global oil is burned in combustion engines.
2789 2018-11-15 19:11:46 Maybe because OPEC us talking about tightening oil supplies?
2790 2018-11-15 19:11:35 They have what is called Qabila/Tribe not country  in real sense of the term and their existence is as firm as shifting sand. Syria is just a trailer, once oil finishes, Karma is with big smirk on face is waiting to seize them by the neck.
2791 2018-11-15 19:11:31 is that oil brand oil? i can't believe you're springing for that
2792 2018-11-15 19:11:22 إللى تريد ... نصل اليك
2793 2018-11-15 19:11:17 High in essential fatty acids, Omega 6 and Omega 3, hemp oil can be used to increase immunity, counteract aging skin, and improve cardiovascular health.
2794 2018-11-15 19:11:16 The irony, Theo, is that China would love to be able to buy Canadian oil.
2795 2018-11-15 19:11:16 We do anything and oil prices will be used to damage us all... they will get arms from us for the foreseeable future regardless of our gov party or their human rights violations... arms is one of our biggest industries, we aren’t going to stop
2796 2018-11-15 19:11:12 Ev’a are kind of ridiculous. Why would anyone actually “own” oil? Isn’t it underground? You don’t value yourself very much do you?
2797 2018-11-15 19:11:08 The Cafe Mac Pizza for lunch today will be: burning crust with fresh motor oil and mushroom.
2798 2018-11-15 19:11:04 Idk Slimm i heard that seasoned puss be hitting different. Like driving a car with a bunch of miles on it but it just had an oil change
2799 2018-11-15 19:11:03 Best move out of the EU as allegedly Malaysia’s governments want palm oil exports to continue or they won’t buy EU made Weapons
2800 2018-11-15 19:10:54 @jimrome @TylerInEdmonton is right, Ketchup is Vile, ketchup IS the most disgusting substance on the face of the planet,

2807 2018-11-15 19:10:23 (it was probably not safe to consume, bottles stuffed with layers of crap in oil was definitely a kitchen decor trend)
2808 2018-11-15 19:10:23 They put cooling oil in it? Wow. That can’t be good.
2809 2018-11-15 19:10:21 Awwww  thanks...maybe an elderly Snow White 

But the birds truly do love me...that is, when I have a dish of black oil sunflower seeds on top of my head

2812 2018-11-15 19:10:14 UH HUH. my overworked car covered in snow and i don’t fix anything but regular oil changes
2813 2018-11-15 19:10:14 bullshitt, sarah, you LIVE in a pristine state and  they're tearing it to pieces w/oil which causes global warming, your animals are dying fast,   the planet is burning up and you make excuses. many mentally challenged people are that way from bad environment thro their mother.

2818 2018-11-15 19:09:33 The shower of grifters, liars,  conmen, snake oil selling charlatans have shown themselves to be cowardly arseholes. 

They have all run away from the very thing that they sought. 

Whether you like the PM  or not, you have to admire her fortitude.
2819 2018-11-15 19:09:30 Is it time to short the stock market? I haven't played with stocks for years but when I did, I bought and sold oil, twitter, and square. I can't remember the tickers $USO, $twtr, and $sqr?
2820 2018-11-15 19:09:29 Ameen ya Allah
2821 2018-11-15 19:09:24 When I wear makeup I double cleanse with the @MAKEUPFOREVERUS oil cleanser and the @SimpleSkincare moisturising cleanser . Plus I wash my face for 60 seconds, a tip I got from @LaBeautyologist. She’s honestly saved my skin
2822 2018-11-15 19:09:17 Replace the coconut oil with rosehip oil. 
2823 2018-11-15 19:09:16 Super!  Thank you Ben - oil price decline may be a nice boost to them as well the Q but I don't know how fast price moves translate to lower OpEx.  Its been a nice play so far
2824 2018-11-15 19:09:15 You don’t like oil? Stop eating. Oil delivers the food you eat. Turn off your heat. Oil delivers the natural gas to heat your home. You can burn the useless car for that heat. You think electric is safe? Guess what runs the equipment to maintain the grid.
2825 2018-11-15 19:09:12 DoFo  announced that the ON gov't will allow any pipeline to come through the province (cancelling their veto) to get oil to the east. He may not block the pipelines - but we, the people, who care if the planet is actually liveable in 2050, fucking WILL. #DoFoMustGoIn2022 #onpoli
2826 2018-11-15 19:08:56 Some balsamic and olive oil with that?
2827 2018-11-15 19:08:52 Because oil from Saudi and gas from Qatar. It's geopolitical
2828 2018-11-15 19:08:45 How yo bath water look like you poured car oil in tht mug
2829 2018-11-15 19:08:40 Not olive oil then?
2830 2018-11-15 19:08:39 They still putting "cooking oil" in the ingredients? I know it makes it "smooth tasting" but it also makes it impossible to make it really cold
2831 2018-11-15 19:08:34 All. Every single one of you even those Oroville types and my father. Pain and patience are like mixing oil with fire sometimes. Really. You think you're gonna cook something good but if you're not careful you're gonna at least set off the smoke alarm.
2832 2018-11-15 19:08:32 Gee, well maybe, just maybe, you are dishonest. You told the Saudi king to ramp up production of oil because you made Iran stop selling oil November 1. However, you allowed 8 countries to buy Iranian oil. So you just screwed Saudi Arabia. You don't think they will screw us now?
2833 2018-11-15 19:08:27 Ameeeen ya Allah.
2834 2018-11-15 19:08:23 I will have no energy after a not-good oil change yesterday. Went home early from work but I'll hang for a few

2836 2018-11-15 19:07:54 If you’ve posted the Iceland advert, actually go and find out the companies using dangerous palm oil sources. Otherwise it’s just free advertising for a brand and nothing else.
2837 2018-11-15 19:07:48 I’m yeen talking bout grease lmao nose look like you dipped it in motor oil
2838 2018-11-15 19:07:05 He claimed that he experienced the effects of the oil patch first hand because of the weird warm wind he felt.... Well he's an idiot and that was a Chinook wind. Has been happening for millions of years haha.

2843 2018-11-15 19:06:18 نعم كل أنحاء المملكة
2844 2018-11-15 19:06:11 EVs or no EVs, it doesn’t matter...

We need a replacement for coal, oil, and natural gas...

Wind and solar are nice, but are supplemental in nature.  Nuclear as it stands is a political mess.

Fusion is the end game, but we might have waited too long.
2845 2018-11-15 19:06:06 What a weird series of tweets... fuel price changes in any particular location can be explained pretty clearly by: crude oil price, FX rate and, If they change, taxes.
2846 2018-11-15 19:05:59 نعم تفضل .... يصلك الزيت ان شاء الله
2847 2018-11-15 19:05:56 I want my hair to grow longer, I’m gone get me some braids and use the right oil.

2855 2018-11-15 19:05:08 Italy and Spain are the two countries where I make it a point to go to the grocery store and buy the most amazing olive oil. The green stuff.  First press.  Swoon.
2856 2018-11-15 19:05:04 Heard today everyone got caught with their pants down and having to cover short positions at the expense of oil
2857 2018-11-15 19:04:52 I love to fry my avocado in coconut oil, seasoned with salt, pepper, cumin, onion powder, and garlic powder, and spritzed with lemon juice once it's on my plate. Delish!! No need to batter your 'cado, just slice it up and fry it.
2858 2018-11-15 19:04:46 Annnnd the truck has an oil leak 
2859 2018-11-15 19:04:43 It's still all about the oil, isn't it? Which explains everything about Texas.
2860 2018-11-15 19:04:34 This guy ehn oil full your head
2861 2018-11-15 19:04:34 My Endocrinologist (former Chief at Johns Hopkins) put me on wild salmon oil & sublingual B12/6 years ago for diabetic neuropathy pain. It is preferable to aspirin & helps with inflammation, heart, nerve & brain health. I buy both at Trader Joe's.

2864 2018-11-15 19:04:20 I have a near-perfect candidate for you, one whom I know the entirety of British government and academia will love getting rid of. But he does have a lot of beliefs - a philosophy; an -ism, if you will - that renders him prone to dousing unusual victims in boiling oil at random.
2865 2018-11-15 19:03:53 Got a fresh box of beard wash, balm, and oil that just came in the mail. 

So, somebody's daughter is gonna smell this beard this weekend.
2866 2018-11-15 19:03:51 Oddly, I eat more red meat, have more heterosexual sex, and consume more oil by driving in bad traffic, when I'm visiting Brazil, than probably anywhere else in the world! :)
2867 2018-11-15 19:03:44 Add rose water and coconut oil to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes, then rinse. Beautifies and softens your skin.
2868 2018-11-15 19:03:43 My eyebrow tech told me about crushing aspirin and using it as a blemish remedy! It definitely worked now I use tea tree + coconut oil as a night mask! Love it and my skin glows!
2869 2018-11-15 19:03:41 Why is it everytime you go in for an oil change, the end result is them telling you 7,000 other issues going on with your car that you damn well knew wasn’t an issue before?!?
2870 2018-11-15 19:03:36 HAHAHA! Allberta never stops whining. Wait until US oil production and exports outpaces Russia and Saudi Arabia. Keep that Canadian tar in the ground. No body wants it.

2877 2018-11-15 19:02:55 Hemp Seed oil contains a desirable 3:1 ratio of Omega 6 to Omega 3 essential fatty acids which is the recommended balance ratio for humans. Hemp seed oil also has other minerals such as potassium, magnesium, iron, zinc, and calcium.
2878 2018-11-15 19:02:46 Good to hear. 
Most of what I hear are feast vs famine stories depending upon the oil price.
2879 2018-11-15 19:02:37 I really don’t either anymore lol I went without buying oil for the longest. Just olive oil for the bottom of the pan

2913 2018-11-15 18:59:57 Holiday mate. Visiting niece who lives in Abu Dhabi and spending few days in Dubai. Amazing what a spare few quid from selling oil to the world can do......!!
2914 2018-11-15 18:59:51 Same problem here everything because of the damn oil sad really 
2915 2018-11-15 18:59:47 Whilst we wait for an update on the 4 block lead please help me think about what's going on with Ghana's oil market.  Don't even know what affetcs it nowadays. Major global correction but nothing.
2916 2018-11-15 18:59:47 You’ve obviously never researched it then if you think battery power is ultimately cleaner over the life-cycle than an engine running on biofuels like ethanol. The more we can displace oil with clean, renewable ethanol the less our carbon footprint will be.
2917 2018-11-15 18:59:41 Without revenue from the collective wealth-oil-Adamawa and 34 other States cannot pay salaries, I wander what explanation will Waziri give them
2918 2018-11-15 18:59:34 But even that is way off in some nebulous abstract. There's no denying that the oil sector AS IT EXISTS TODAY is getting killed.
2919 2018-11-15 18:59:30 They've used our oil water & power. Scotland is self sufficient in foodstuffs producing 8.5 days worth per week. So we have heat & power food & water. Check out England - not so much. Who will want to trade

2921 2018-11-15 18:59:25 Oh. I don’t eat real butter. No oil. No meat. I didn’t even add the fake butter. Season it to your taste but I suggest dried butter beans instead of canned limas
2922 2018-11-15 18:59:15 The environmental movement has nothing to do with protecting the environment. It’s about USA having control of CDN oil. Fight fire with fire
2923 2018-11-15 18:58:59 Got Oil?
2924 2018-11-15 18:58:50 A diversified economy would not only benefit the environment but provide stability against the boom/bust cycles of the volatile oil markets.

2927 2018-11-15 18:58:44 Totally get that. I’m talking about the long term. I’m dubious as to whether we see as many six-figure salaries in the patch as we did during the boom /when/ we are able to move forward on TMX, KXL, etc. Not saying oil shouldn’t be a thing, but it can’t be the only thing.

2933 2018-11-15 18:57:55 For diesel and bunker oil. Carbon emissions is one thing. Nox, sox, sooth etc is another. Eg sooth laid on snow increases snow melt speed tremendously. A diesel truck is much better non carbon emission wise than a ship.

2936 2018-11-15 18:57:43 @LindaFoods I absolutely love your vegetarian sausages, especially since trying to eat more vegan food, but was gutted today when I realised that they contain palm oil! Are you reviewing the recipe so that it doesn’t contain this ingredient which is so harmful to our environment?
2937 2018-11-15 18:57:38 Mobil oil.

2945 2018-11-15 18:56:33 The most important part of a bodega sandwich is its inconsistency. Got the same sandwich from the same store made by the same guy today and yesterday and today the guy was like: fuck it, no tomato or onion but you do get oil and vinegar.
2946 2018-11-15 18:56:27 Apparently the last person to use our cooking oil decided to (instead of close the bottle like a normal person) put the cap on top of it. So when I reached for salt on my chaotic spice rack I got oil all over. I'm basically a pan fried chicken. Put a fork in me I'm done.

2957 2018-11-15 18:55:15 And what you're failing to consider is that the discount for a barrel of oil from Alberta is at record highs right now, which is hurting the workers (and families and government revenues) that are still part of the oil economy there.
2958 2018-11-15 18:55:00 Gee, sounds like these people actually believed the propaganda the NRA sold them. Tone has changed bigly in Washington, as the legal machine moves forward.

We don’t need the oil.
Another country that uses us.
Did you possibly mean throwing Jared and Ivanka’s relationship with Saudi Arabia?

2968 2018-11-15 18:53:49 Worth noting, vehicle diesel is 35 second fuel, a measurement of viscosity,  jet fuel kerosene is 28 second fuel, same stuff just a bit thinner.
Appogies if you are already aware. 
Ships use heavy oil, again same stuff much thicker less refined than the other 2

Increased immigration for increased productivity and larger tax base!

2989 2018-11-15 18:52:06 But what @MichelleRempel fails to consider is oil’s never coming back for the people on the ground in the same way it was before. All sectors have found ways to do the same or more with fewer people. AI, robotics, the workforce has changed. Oil will be no unicorn in this regard.
2990 2018-11-15 18:52:00 Week three of using cbd oil and I feel like my neck has been replaced.

3004 2018-11-15 18:50:19 She also tried to force me to use lard, because apparently 4% animal fat 'doesn't count' and using olive oil AS PER THE INGREDIENT LIST would set my pan on fire. Then yelled at me for making pancakes without starting a fire?
3005 2018-11-15 18:50:13 Don’t forget they get rid of their critics in vats of acid too, real cheery bunch. If only Canada had oil and the technology to ship and refine it, we would be energy independent, oh well, just a dream.

3007 2018-11-15 18:50:06 #FunnyFacts : No more talks on #RUPEE valuations & #crude oil prices. All of a sudden people changed their profession from being Economists to Defence Analyst due to #RafaleDeal .

3010 2018-11-15 18:49:50 年上のおねーさん、僕からの好きのコールに「いぇーい♡ばんざい！」とかいうクソ適当なスルーレスポンスでkillしてくるし私はどうすればいいの…

3012 2018-11-15 18:49:38 try oil! butter will make them burn faster i learned that on youtube
3013 2018-11-15 18:49:27 Me: *in assembly in primary school*

My brain:

Dont sing it
Dont sing it
Dont sing it
Dont sing it

GIVE ME OIL IN MY LAMP KEEP ME BURNING
3014 2018-11-15 18:49:27 Oilers twitter and math go together like oil and water
3015 2018-11-15 18:49:19 You dangerous . You reckon cooking oil is in short supply hee?
3016 2018-11-15 18:49:17 bc mondelez (their parent company) is a major buyer of palm oil and i’d do anything to save the orangutans 
3017 2018-11-15 18:49:14 the physicians formula butter bronzer smells like banana boat tanning oil and i’m obsessed
3018 2018-11-15 18:49:14 Getting this oil changed!!!!!
3019 2018-11-15 18:49:10 I Been getting my oil changed and car wash since 10:30.. tf
3020 2018-11-15 18:49:03 今日は何オイルがいいかい?アロマオイルで香りたい?オリーブオイルでイタリアンたい?ふふふ…僕は君のためならどんなオイルにもなってやるさ…
3021 2018-11-15 18:48:57 So I am curious. Why don't the oil companies just stop production? No one is forcing them to do this. Why does @YourAlberta have to interfere in their private business model? So odd.
3022 2018-11-15 18:48:52 Gonna take my wig off, wash it , add clips, oil my braids and try and sew it back onto my head myself tonight lol wish me fucking luck cause i duck at hair
3023 2018-11-15 18:48:51 nut air around her or oil nut there?
3024 2018-11-15 18:48:48 I believe @JustinTrudeau is trying to do what his father couldn’t do in the 80’s. 
It’s far easier to manipulate a nationalized oil industry & control what each province should receive.
3025 2018-11-15 18:48:33 You're welcome for our oil.
3026 2018-11-15 18:48:31 put tea tree oil on it! You can find it at Wal-Mart!!
3027 2018-11-15 18:48:30 Sosai ba kadan ba
3028 2018-11-15 18:48:22 Tea tree + coconut oil combo for the hair is undefeated
3029 2018-11-15 18:48:21 i txted my friend to say that whenever i put this new oil on i think of her cuz it reminds me of her natural scent & now i miss her & this bitch gon respond “thank you”.

see why im not sweet to y’all?!?
3030 2018-11-15 18:48:15 Let’s get to Lucas Oil. #ButtPat
3031 2018-11-15 18:48:12 No. Oil prices are heading now to $0. And soon they will start paying you at the pump when you pull up.
3032 2018-11-15 18:48:07 Only I would put a pan of boiling hot oil under the tap and make it go everywhere and burn my finger :)
3033 2018-11-15 18:48:03 I'm with you on that always read everything I buy to make sure it doesn't have palm oil but it's in loads of stuff
3034 2018-11-15 18:47:56 I know for sure there is research on the public relations strategy for the BP oil spill. I would love to learn more about this case study.
3035 2018-11-15 18:47:50 Enabled by establishment Dem elected in CO. Several CO Dem legislators have accepted oil and gas campaign donations and Polis himself is invested in fracking, check the Congressional filings - Bow River Capital (mngr is chair of CO Concern) for one and the investment in Cirque.
3036 2018-11-15 18:47:46 If only Eastern Canada could ween itself off of Saudi oil. If only we could all ween ourselves off of technology like you. Curious, how does your medical practice work without oil by-products today? Please share this amazing feat!
3037 2018-11-15 18:47:32 Sterlingisation would be an issue I agree but disentagling from uk would take yrs, providing time to set up a central Bank & currency (& oil fund) on top of investment bank under discussion already. It would be unexplored territory with lots of unknowns but not insurmountable imo
3038 2018-11-15 18:47:31 Yesterday I went to get my oil changed and the dude was like "Yeah itll take like an hour to get to you plus like 30 to get it done"

Today I just pulled up and they got me in and out in like 20 minutes.

Lucky me!
3039 2018-11-15 18:47:21 Nothing like being told we don't want your oil, and we don't want anyone else to have it either. Like psychotic lovers - I DONT WANT YOU AND NO ONE ELSE CAN HAVE YOU!
3040 2018-11-15 18:47:18 Just have some olive oil with it Ed!
3041 2018-11-15 18:47:18 No, like you said it’s a pissed in poisoned chalice. Who wants to try to deliver the undeliverable! The snake oil salesmen are all waiting in the wings though...
3042 2018-11-15 18:47:15 yeah once you put weed oil in it
3043 2018-11-15 18:47:08 Whats the key ingredient in asphalt? Oil.
Granted, somehow it doesn't burn like an oil but will smolder if conditions are right
3044 2018-11-15 18:47:04 In Jasper, Alabama the best sushi you will find is at a gas station. They order fish daily from the gulf. And an oil change/service station offers the best breakfast in the state!
3045 2018-11-15 18:46:58 After a long time of procrastinating I finally got that oil change
3046 2018-11-15 18:46:58 would that qualify Matt the Snake Oil Attorney for federal charges of his own?
3047 2018-11-15 18:46:56 Under Trump we have not seen any significant movement in our relations, yes we got waiver for Iran oil,  S400 but still there is plenty of opportunity for both countries to collaborate. 

No one can doubt we are peace loving country & Indians have always embraced local culture.
3048 2018-11-15 18:46:46 Thanks Darci for the testimonial!

"I used the #PinPoint App at Valvoline Instant Oil Change for an oil change and saved big with my Welcome Reward - love all the great deals I get, thank you!" Darci P.
3049 2018-11-15 18:46:42 The government’s in shambles, palm oil production is killing organutans and I’m about to download TikTok... basically armageddon
3050 2018-11-15 18:46:42 @LindaFoods I absolutely love your vegetarian sausages, they’ve been a god send since tying to eat vegan, but I was gutted today when I realised they contain palm oil! Are you reviewing the recipe so that it doesn’t use this ingredient which is so harmful to our environment?
3051 2018-11-15 18:46:42 So a barrel of Brent Crude Oil has reached £65 a barrel today with the #brexitchaos. No idea where you buy one though? 
3052 2018-11-15 18:46:40 @ITVChase' advertised as burpless' was fish oil -as most of them repeat on u when u swallow them!! (Fish burps) lol
3053 2018-11-15 18:46:37 Oil onde? Sobe 0.7%...
BR puxa EEM, não o contrário.
3054 2018-11-15 18:46:35 Would rather support foreign oil and terror regimes then!! Good for you 
3055 2018-11-15 18:46:23 Cruz has been around a long time, unfortunately. And rural TX is full of hillbillies, oil barons, gun nuts and religious nutters.
3056 2018-11-15 18:46:21 Jubrin approves renewal of three oil licences... Note: These licences are being extended as continuation of the supposed '16 years of @OfficialPDPNig mismanagement'...
3057 2018-11-15 18:46:19 Nigeria needs new money to survive.

Oil can't sustain us any second longer.

 The new money would come inform of tax.

Tax can only come if businesses re thriving.

Businesses can thrive if there is Investment.

For Investment to come, sound policies need to be in place.
3058 2018-11-15 18:46:18 omega-3, fish oil capsules?

3060 2018-11-15 18:46:13 The lack of oil in Germany could push it closer to Russia. Also likely why they've wanted to keep the Iran deal
3061 2018-11-15 18:46:05 Put t’ wood in t’oil lass
3062 2018-11-15 18:45:56 finally gets my car checked and oil change a month after i was supposed to
3063 2018-11-15 18:45:46 So why wouldn’t you think trump has connections to this? We know putin is all about the oil. And it doesn’t take a genius to see who Fox News is playing up to.
3064 2018-11-15 18:45:43 Went to the doctor with Jerrilynn Brian Gomez. She introduced me as her mom and he said we looked like sisters, and that I have no wrinkles. Lol. Oil of Olay.
3065 2018-11-15 18:45:41 Everywhere Perfume Oil sellers
3066 2018-11-15 18:45:40 @CanadianTire got an oil change last Saturday and now my car is leaking oil. Am I going to have to pay for the fix?
3067 2018-11-15 18:45:40 if you strip your hair of its natural oils by washing it too often it will produce more oil! Your hair has to adjust to not washing it everyday and then you’ll be good 
3068 2018-11-15 18:45:38 true journo's follow the truth. what you probably see as journalism on tv is actually deemed "infotainment" and is supported by Big Oil, Big Pharma and Defense contractors- so journos are forbidden from reporting any truth that will hurt said industries. hope that helps

3071 2018-11-15 18:44:56 Flipping snake oil salesman.
3072 2018-11-15 18:44:47 What will be getting built in London with the money's from  this oil ?
3073 2018-11-15 18:44:47 Well since women want to be equals...where are the Mrs.Dads out there...women fixing things, changing oil, climbing under the house to fix plumbing and such.  That is what I did last week, 3 hrs under the house in the crawl space to fix plumbing!!!
3074 2018-11-15 18:44:42 Bond market is driving #banknifty inr appreciation is not good for tech and export stock and crude is impacting crude oil cos as they would face MTM losses expecting market to correct tomorrow as crude will surge to 59 and USDINR will reach to 72.5 and banknifty @ 25800 close

3076 2018-11-15 18:44:36 True. However Turkey transforming itself into an oil & gas pipeline from Egypt & Israel into Europe has made itself indispensable to the EU.
3077 2018-11-15 18:44:24 Wow I really gotta spend $60 on an oil change 
3078 2018-11-15 18:44:17 โบกมือทักทายไปคะะะ
3079 2018-11-15 18:44:16 Market manipulation for sure...just like in oil. Worked in one place so keep it rolling
3080 2018-11-15 18:44:14 Hi Arthur, we send everything you need to make an incredible meal except for salt, pepper, and oil. This way, you can use the olive oil or oil you prefer depending on the recipe! DM us with any other questions.

3086 2018-11-15 18:43:43 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.
3087 2018-11-15 18:43:41 I’m not sure how advocating for economic diversity, whether it be from oil or autos or tourism or whatever is arrogant. It seems to be that Albertans are the ones who think it’s an either/or proposition. It can be both.
3088 2018-11-15 18:43:38 Can't believe allu still tripping on this oil down topic
3089 2018-11-15 18:43:36 No they won't, there's no $ in sewage!  Foreign funded protests clearly target O&G. Solely for the economic purpose of keeping our oil in the ground & that which gets to market is heavily discount. Those countries reap the benefit of higher prices & more sales of their own oil.
3090 2018-11-15 18:43:34 What happens if you pour cooking oil all over someone’s car??
3091 2018-11-15 18:43:31 Of course he didnt... Hes a fast talking snake oil salesman... When he started floundering did hos caucus clap for him to simulate a victory and keep him calm?
3092 2018-11-15 18:43:30 but to be fair, it's not like we can expect the anti-climate, coal, oil and gas lobbies to do some soul-searching.... that would be predicated on them having a soul. 
3093 2018-11-15 18:43:28 I think Scotland has a big advantage. It would soon get rid of the debt burden foisted on us by Westminster. The point I was making about Norway was they managed to make a profit on their oil at a time UK was giving oil companies tax breaks, boosting shareholders dividends.
3094 2018-11-15 18:43:23 You're first reply to me was about Scotland's oil thicko. Read what you wrote.
3095 2018-11-15 18:43:22 Oil never sleeps
3096 2018-11-15 18:43:21 Yes I will. We have some traditional Eccles cakes in the kitchen that hubby bought. Am just gonna go check them now......
OMG peeled off covering price label and they include Palm oil!!!!!
Grrrrrr am so cross. I never thought. Thanks for the warning.

3099 2018-11-15 18:43:05 Repeating the same mistakes politically over and over is not going to change the status quo. Power will not relinquish power by people voting for the same system over and over. It's not just the prison system. It's the wars for profit killing sending our families to fight for oil
3100 2018-11-15 18:43:01 We should see if we can respond by buying even more oil from Saudi and reduce our dependence on Canadian resources. @JustinTrudeau
3101 2018-11-15 18:42:59 Yeah coconut oil and some serious brushing should get you right lol
3102 2018-11-15 18:42:59 This is ballony, if it wasn't for Trudeau and the liberals the oil could come from Alberta and get put back into our country not the middle east. Use your head glen.
3103 2018-11-15 18:42:48 Canadians have turned their backs on themselves, we shouldn’t be buying anything from other countries if we have our own supply. Only common sense, but  @MikeHudema @Greenpeace and others seem to think oil from other countries is better for the environment. Ignorance is bliss
3104 2018-11-15 18:42:44 my cbd oil arrives today and excited to try it cause my anxiety is shit
3105 2018-11-15 18:42:39 An oil producing state owing workers' salaries! I'm sure Okowa will still owe the @NGSuperEagles too. Looks like owing is in his DNA
3106 2018-11-15 18:42:16 lol, that is why I said the quality of your "bad decisions"

Some life lessons, need to be "experiential" 

Ask formerly "nerdy" engineers who ended up in Oil & Gas, mummy's boys delivered to the wilds of Warri, PH & Eket.

Most learnt quickly.

;-)

Some did not
3107 2018-11-15 18:42:02 That is a weird shift, your not getting the same sunlight that gives us that energy to work. Besides the snacks and  midday movements I suggested, try having peppermint oil or Citrus type lotions on you. They say they can keep you simulated if they are constantly around you
3108 2018-11-15 18:41:46 I love me some Albertans oil. Had 2 cups this morning and even put some homemade Baileys in it.  
Sending much love from the Ontario Manufacturing sector.  You do the pumping and I'll make the plastics.
3109 2018-11-15 18:41:28 How much of the rate drop is attributable to the recent oil price collapse?
3110 2018-11-15 18:41:19 Oil change real quick
3111 2018-11-15 18:41:15 SICK of these GLOBALIST sect members masquerading as constitutional conservatives.

Even more nauseating are the folks who believe Flake, Romney, etc. are some fulfillment of prophecy.Those who vote these snake  oil salesmen into office have endowed them w/a Messianic Syndrome.
3112 2018-11-15 18:41:13 In 2010 Murdoch said Genie would create a "global, geopolitical paradigm shift". Then in 2011, with Genie affiliate AFEK drilling for oil in occupied Golan heights - suddenly there's a civil war in Syria. What a coincidence!
3113 2018-11-15 18:41:10 Serious mind cleansing and mentality reorientation is needed in this part of twitter.
3114 2018-11-15 18:41:04 You're brakes won't work too well with oil on them!
3115 2018-11-15 18:40:59 Don’t quote Greek at me! One difference is oil is expensive and at the end of a bull-run whereas I would stay sterling is on the cheap side now. I see it at 1.25 at end 2019 (going lower meantime) and oscillating around 1.40 over the longer term. Closer to bottom than top, though
3116 2018-11-15 18:40:56 @KingTomas I'm happy with how CC went.. good ?s and answers. If oil plays nice this free money. If/when fear leaves oil price this booms!

3122 2018-11-15 18:40:19 Got my oil and spark plugs changed on my car and now she be running like brand new with dents. 
3123 2018-11-15 18:40:07 Should I keep going? Is that enough? And sorry I was "rude" to you, but those of us that do care about freedom, democracy, truth, and everything else America was founded on can see through this snake oil salesman and want to stop him before he destroys the country.

3129 2018-11-15 18:39:42 if your latkes are lacking a bit in the FAT department, sour cream adds some more of that ( = luxurious, creamy ACID)

if your latkes are still dripping oil, any extra FAT is unappealing, stick with the FAT-less applesauce (straight ACID no chaser)

Or if you're like me, add both

3131 2018-11-15 18:39:36 Can’t believe it cost $21,000 to get a oil change for a Bugatti 
3132 2018-11-15 18:39:29 What was 'bad'? Proles lied in saying that Stalin "did nothing wrong" in Spain. So you appear to disagree with them there. Or are you talking about Article 121 as being bad?
Are you really trying to say that trade in oil/weapons & exchange of political prisoners was "necessary"?

3135 2018-11-15 18:39:12 It’s normally to use olive oil to make eggs but Donia uses vegetable oil or butter to make them 
3136 2018-11-15 18:39:08 From my ex Reuters colleague:

Oversupply is coming - U.S. #crude futures curve for 2019 now firmly in #contango. Most notably, after the steep selloff on Tuesday, WTI Dec 2019 vs Dec 2020, a popular trade in #oil markets, flipped to a discount for the first time since Oct 201
3137 2018-11-15 18:39:02 @NotDeadGlomar look at Lake Travis, it's near-ish Austin, or Cedar Park. LT has a giant new high school, as does Cedar Park. Near oil and politics, but not in the middle of the crazy left Cali that Austin has become.
3138 2018-11-15 18:38:49 His game plan mirrors what the Arian army out of ohio wanted to accomplish. To Reestablish white male dominance in today's society. The moves this administration are making are gonna be harder to clean up than a BP oil spill. #bigfacts
3139 2018-11-15 18:38:47 Oil is on your head as flesh and blood did not reveal this to you 
3140 2018-11-15 18:38:45 Hope to get out of our #Yemen quagmire is by #USA sanctions that might bend #Iran

But Iran just started to sell oil cheaper and expects help from some countries

A distant but greater hope is if we stop Switch On/Off fronts and take our fight into our hands
3141 2018-11-15 18:38:44 Aye. I would choose brine over sunflower oil too.
3142 2018-11-15 18:38:42 So we're aiming to have it both ways: use a steadily rising carbon price to cut our demand for fossil fuels and emissions, while continuing to ship oil and expand pipeline capacity (especially TMX) instead of leaving money on the table.
3143 2018-11-15 18:38:36 Up here getting my oil changed . They up here lit in the work area  
3144 2018-11-15 18:38:25 ADAM's the ultimate score, kid. No more grifts. No more scams. A monopoly on ADAM makes Standard Oil look like the Piggly Wiggly.
3145 2018-11-15 18:38:20 97 naira per,  1000 staff strength,  now 100 %  oil earnings ... see goofing  .... go and learn economics .... Sai baba the true reformer
3146 2018-11-15 18:38:20 There is oil on every continent 
Let’s just put it in the oceans
3147 2018-11-15 18:38:09 I CANNOT FATHOM SPENDING A WORK PAYCHECK OR SAVED MONEY TO GET MY CAR REPAIRED. IN ADDITION, INFINITI OIL CHANGE COST ME $40.00 AT THE INFINITI DEALER. I AM A BIG CONGRATULATOR THAT WHAT YOU HAVE IS GOOD FOR YOU. I AM AN INFINITI GIRL. IT IS CHIC LIKE, CLASSY AND SEXY TO ME!
3148 2018-11-15 18:37:47 USA is in rat race to be the biggest oil producer, in fact they are. While making money, they are fucking with the environment a big time, that's why they should stop.
3149 2018-11-15 18:37:44 梅〜覚えてるか？俺だよ俺！ひさびさに梅と会いたいし成人式楽しみにしてるぞぉ〜
3150 2018-11-15 18:37:43 That's a little like asking what my favourite essential oil is ….I can't give you a specific one........love clear quartz, amethyst, mango calcite and selenite, fluorite....see what I mean lol?! ….I guess I am more drawn to the semi precious ones.... :) xx
3151 2018-11-15 18:37:36 I wouldn't associate Venezuela with capitalism tbh. Fact is no country that has oil will ever be free of machinations of the greatest empire in history. Cut em some slack!
3152 2018-11-15 18:37:32 Unless the oil was decarbed you’re just gonna get sick
3153 2018-11-15 18:37:24 Oil City Sleet Rabbits. Your turn @ZBraves31 and @ETNreisenweber
3154 2018-11-15 18:37:22 There you go folks @Poundland reply me about addressing selling cheap chocolate no doubt full of planet destroying unsustainable palm oil #NoPalmOilChristmas #boycott #IcelandAdvert #RangTan they can't be bothered to check.
3155 2018-11-15 18:37:22 When water protectors put their bodies on the line to stop climate change, Hillary was a no-show. She never approved anything. P.S. Ever heard of Jill Stein? She would have made oil irrelevant by now had you elected her in 2012. You live in a world where fossil fuel donors rule!
3156 2018-11-15 18:37:16 Is there a list of products that contain palm oil from a NON sustainable source?? My workplace are fully backing the Iceland advert x
3157 2018-11-15 18:37:13 Because most oil companies are licensed in some US state that does not have corporate taxes, the sons of the founding mothers feared democracy, oil companies ran out of markets to grow into, the Birch society set in motion Citizens United. So now we need sudden economic change.
3158 2018-11-15 18:37:10 I’m really hoping I didn’t crack my oil pan 
3159 2018-11-15 18:37:05 Unfortunately people have lost their touch with the reality. So, it’s all ponies and rainbows when we pay other provinces billions of dollars in equalization pay, but how dare we work in oil and gas!
3160 2018-11-15 18:37:04 I have to pull an oil pan because a little tiny plastic piece broke off of the dip stick and fell in it. We tried telling the trucker not to worry about it. He insisted that it needs to be removed. I’m reusing the oil. Fuck em
3161 2018-11-15 18:37:03 Hey beautiful people I sell original undiluted designer oil perfumes, will have you smelling like a billionaire without breaking the bank

3165 2018-11-15 18:36:28 Tbh I'd sorta really love it, if a heap of us said FU to Kraft Foods and boycotted @CadburyIreland #Roses this winter festival season. They have palm oil, are not fair trade, are smaller, & I hate the new wrappers.
3166 2018-11-15 18:36:28 Oil up and get that shot.

3169 2018-11-15 18:36:11 Blimey if you didn’t cry there’s no hope  watch the Iceland palm oil one that had me choked up, real life , real issues not Let’s bum John Elton advert 
3170 2018-11-15 18:36:08 Came to get an oil change and I honestly think I just got rigged into all this extra stuff
3171 2018-11-15 18:36:07 Deal! Oil for autos seems like a fair trade off, fart in the room.
3172 2018-11-15 18:36:06 What does xle/oil ratio look like to you?
3173 2018-11-15 18:36:03 first thing i do when i stay in an airbnb is drink all of their olive oil
3174 2018-11-15 18:35:55 I find Carmex drying, personally. Beeswax is probably good. I’ll try anything. Olive oil, coconut oil, WD-40...whatever it takes.
3175 2018-11-15 18:35:45 @ddailyreport The El Rufai report on Restructuring does not support Resource Control. Page 30 of that report says that oil in the waters of Nigeria belong to the Federal government.That introduces the Offshore/Onshore dichotomy which is against the ruling of the Supreme Court.
3176 2018-11-15 18:35:22 I would love to oil them everyday for you and suck them as long as you want
3177 2018-11-15 18:35:18 Mix vitamin E baby lotion and coconut oil in a jar
3178 2018-11-15 18:35:15 Oh no the gun nut snake oil salesman disapproves! 
3179 2018-11-15 18:35:04 I've been loving my new silveries but it may be time for a peek-a-boo oil slick again.....
3180 2018-11-15 18:34:59 - the possessed and have them literally drive the demon off of the ship. There isn't a fancy ritual or anything, but we will need a lot of prayer and potentially a little olive oil.
3181 2018-11-15 18:34:35 The Midas down the street has a sign that says "Pumpkin Spice Oil Changes are Back!".
3182 2018-11-15 18:34:25 It’s so annoying how mechanics try to take advantage of girls bc they don’t know much about cars, my fiancé went to get a oil change and told her there was like 10 things wrong, smh our car better run like a champ now
3183 2018-11-15 18:34:23 I am now reluctantly and with frustration out of canadian oil investments 
3184 2018-11-15 18:34:21 @Edsall Outstanding column today, Mr. Edsall!  Born in Ft. Worth to an oilman father and Mississippi mother, both voting Republican, I was reared in Oklahoma, a Democratic dominated state like Texas growing up.  But LBJ's Civil Rights laws and oil exploration figured prominently.
3185 2018-11-15 18:34:13 have you seen Alberta oil fields?? the waters are so polluted people are getting cancer all the time.. there has to be a better way
3186 2018-11-15 18:33:53 Oh yes girl. It’s s light oil so it’s not like dipping yourself in olive oil. Just pay dry with a towel and boom! Feeling like siiiillkkkk
3187 2018-11-15 18:33:50 U.S. Oil, Gas Permitting Still Rising, Pointing to Stronger Activity in 2019, Says Evercore
3188 2018-11-15 18:33:44 Hi John! Trying to cut global emissions by withholding supply is both expensive ($15B/year) and ineffective. Why? Because oil-importing countries will just buy their oil elsewhere. So there's no contradiction between cutting our own demand *and* continuing supply.
3189 2018-11-15 18:33:28 Go for the stuff in olive oil if you can get it. I even drink the oil when I'm finished lol.
3190 2018-11-15 18:33:26 Michelle
 Im from Ontario remember. TO thinks their centre of the universe. Thanks to the west we have a power. To influance the world. Oil. If all the shitheads. Would see that. Thanks to the wesy
3191 2018-11-15 18:33:18 You are a shameless chancer. A snake oil merchant. A creeping racist. A subversive influence. An enemy of the people. You are a fraud. If the country had an MRI you would be identified as a malignant tumour. It is time for you to go. You never had a seat in Parliament. Just go.
3192 2018-11-15 18:33:02 We will never be the same. Like oil and water.
3193 2018-11-15 18:32:46 feet to the fire; they just decided to take money from the oil industry. She'll get to the other side when the Dems realize how vital it is to change their platform on climate.
3194 2018-11-15 18:32:41 Osha go get castor oil and soap.
3195 2018-11-15 18:32:31 Heb al gehoord dat tea tree oil goed werk bij sommigen, kost 2€ in de Kruidvat!

3199 2018-11-15 18:32:02 Rye bread tastes like I’m standing too close to an essential oil diffuser. 

Don’t @ me.
3200 2018-11-15 18:31:54 Which turned first, oil or the market.  It’s all oil
3201 2018-11-15 18:31:43 @redkenuk can you tell me if your products contain palm oil.  If so, where is it sourced from?
3202 2018-11-15 18:31:41 How many oil byproducts are used in this doctor's hospital I wonder? 
3203 2018-11-15 18:31:35 have you tried argan oil?
3204 2018-11-15 18:31:24 Coz in consultancy time is money and waste a time that’s money down the drain... it took me 3 months and my Report OCD was thrown out of the window if I’m obsessed with certain project reports I have to burn midnight oil and keep it moving...
3205 2018-11-15 18:31:21 I sell original undiluted designer oil perfumes, check my page,let's help you smell nice at a budget
3206 2018-11-15 18:31:19 @JareerElass explains how higher oil prices is helping Riyadh’s budget. Putin singing same tune today about Russian budget surplus. But emerging markets economic health is also critical to oil price trends. US treasury thinks prices need to be lower to stave off downturn
3207 2018-11-15 18:30:48 Trump is not smart enough to plan this. 

I am sure he was a willing partner in the scheme. These moves will drive higher profits to American oil industry executives since there is no longer a gate-keeper in the WH. 

NO savings will be passed to the consumer. We lose, they win.
3208 2018-11-15 18:30:48 ok ok, am all for stop the dirty palm oil.. but for fuck sake don,t take away chocolate...just saying...xx
3209 2018-11-15 18:30:47 How about giving us a baloney reading on comparing the gun homicide rate to 2013, when it was at its lowest level in decades?

That's the kind of tactic Big Oil uses to pretend global warming has stopped.  It's baloney when they do it, and it's baloney when you do it.
3210 2018-11-15 18:30:44 We don’t intentionally dump oil into our waterways. WTF
3211 2018-11-15 18:30:35 I thought my day couldn’t get any worse till I found out Nutella had palm oil in it. Disastrous

3217 2018-11-15 18:30:01 Remember that time I took a day off, went to change the oil in my car and spent nearly the whole day at the dealership because new brake pads, filters, something else? Yeah, adulting sucks today.
3218 2018-11-15 18:29:54 Got a question for you @Carpedaryn ,

Whats the best way you could describe how the cbd oil made you feel? Cause ik when i smoke i sometimes get paranoid & feel like im dying lol. Looking to try cbd tho!!
3219 2018-11-15 18:29:53 Seriously tho i don’t understand the number of people running around SF without facemasks on like they’re 2 tuff and immune to 171 ppm of smoke.  Friendly reminder that the oil in poison oak goes airborne in a fire.
3220 2018-11-15 18:29:47 @tdichristopher  "Oil Analysis Say" REALLY????  Is that what they say... well your readers say you are STUPID.. We care about results not what FAKE NEWS says...GET A CLUE.......
3221 2018-11-15 18:29:43 She put you on the spot bruh... normally people start you with a dessert or some shit. May the spirits of your ancestors bless your hands & the oil that day

3223 2018-11-15 18:29:27 Skip Katy, right next to Woodlands. Crazy teacher stories every other year. Like, they sound like from Cali, not Texas.

Oil, gas, leasing, refineries, shipping, maritime law. Pick a specialty, they all seem to be pretty lucrative.
3224 2018-11-15 18:29:23 I heard a boy making fun of girls getting their oil changed bc they always fall for getting a new air filter & windshield wiper fluid & I had the audacity to laugh knowing that’s me every time
3225 2018-11-15 18:29:12 I'M HAPPY FOR YOU "OIL TOT"! IT'S TIME TO SHOW THE WORLD HOW A DISNEY PRINCE TRULY SEEKS OUT FAME!
3226 2018-11-15 18:29:12 
3227 2018-11-15 18:29:09 I would give them our answer right now “we don’t want your oil” there should be huge sanctions on Saudi Arabia the only thing there ever going to understand is $$
3228 2018-11-15 18:29:02 That’s good to know  I was suggesting that stores could assist the consumer as they do with other “free from” products...although Palm Oil doesn’t necessarily affect human health doesn’t make it less important! #wecanalldoourbit #PalmOil
3229 2018-11-15 18:28:44 Только сейчас осознала, что целые залы наполнены только арми и все они смотрят на бантан 
А я сижу дома и пытаюсь не плакать#BurnTheStageTheMovie
3230 2018-11-15 18:28:44 Ethical oil is a farce as CPCs use it. But if we don’t want to sell our military equipment to Saudis, then we shouldn’t be buying their oil either. Funding human rights abuses on top of climate change is reprehensible.
3231 2018-11-15 18:28:37 Crude oil also went up 50% that year so it makes sense that gas started to go up
3232 2018-11-15 18:28:37 animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
3233 2018-11-15 18:28:26 I find it very interesting that Rupert Murdock is on this genie oil board
3234 2018-11-15 18:28:26 CBD oil? (Catastrophic Brexit Deal).
3235 2018-11-15 18:28:22 Oil money makes you exempt
3236 2018-11-15 18:28:17 Ask Iran, Venezuela, North Korea or Zimbabwe how it worked for them.

No plane parts so no planes, no mining machinery, no car parts, no chemicals so no industry, overpay oil...

You know how to manufacture enough cellphones, steel, nitrogen?
3237 2018-11-15 18:28:17 That's a huge drop man. Apparently the oil nations dropped the price, is it true?
3238 2018-11-15 18:28:16 I prefer products that say virgin on it, like extra virgin olive oil, cause i don't want to buy a slutty oil made from slut olives.
3239 2018-11-15 18:28:09 Well Fusion energy is coming the Germans are almost there and will have large capacity laser weapons soon after that Fusion energy endless energy oil companies are like dinosaurs and it’s a national security issue to cut Putin’s throat let him drowned in oilcut off all$2Putin
3240 2018-11-15 18:28:02 That question is irrelevant. It’s not intended to. It’s intended to make money. That’s it. Some scientists say it’s no better than coal. Some say it’s worse. Some a little better. Oil and gas corporations have zero interest in the environment.
3241 2018-11-15 18:28:01 Fort Worth is trying to pick up tech. It has gov't offices. 
San Antonio has military, heavy Hispanics.
Around Austin is great and expensive. Building out into farm communities.
Woodlands are gorgeous. Planned community for an oil company, built on plan from 70s- so human-scale!
3242 2018-11-15 18:27:46 We don’t have to burn this oil - which is the basis of the pharmaceutical industry of of different kinds of plastic that underpin.modern life .

Me: Oh look at the big bullet!!! 

Hubby: Lesley, that’s a drill bit for drilling oil

Me: It got fired from being a bullet then. *giggles

Hubby:  *walks away
3249 2018-11-15 18:27:04 Wait.. you're an anti-palm oil, pro-menstrual health, anti-Islam, pro-Katie Hopkins fan that HASN'T heard of Jack Monroe? I can't even begin to unpick that.

3255 2018-11-15 18:26:23 Cows pollute the air more than cars. God created this earth to work with us in mind. Dinosaurs were created and died out before we where put here for our oil resource, it's our choice on how we deal with it/He did not put us here without first giving us resources to live
3256 2018-11-15 18:26:23 Coconut oil kills! (According to AHA)
3257 2018-11-15 18:26:10 I'm gonna try mustard oil for my back. I've tried everything else.
3258 2018-11-15 18:26:08 The study is consistent with my guidance. Exercise, eat whole foods, mostly plant-based e.g. fruits & vegies, whole grains, fiber, legumes, nuts, healthy fats (e.g. olive oil), fish, use herbs & spices, & limit red meat, sweets, sugar-added items. I do recommend portion control.

3260 2018-11-15 18:26:02 I suggest, govt should stop immediately trading of Agri  commodities like rice, sugar, oil, ghee, grains etc. And all other basic items like cotton, chilli, chana, pulses etc.
As trading these items brings more volatility and manipulation in their prices.
3261 2018-11-15 18:25:55 We bought the mighty S 400 from Russia, we continue to import crude oil from Iran, and we are still a favoured nation to US without them sanctioning us under CAATSA. Thats Modi’s foreign policy to our beloved India....

3266 2018-11-15 18:25:16 It couldn’t be because Texas has oil derricks and refineries in their back yard. Do I want Oregon to be more like Texas? Hell no.
3267 2018-11-15 18:25:15 If you are looking at oil I think #AMER offers exceptional value.

3269 2018-11-15 18:24:58 i love mine now but i’m sick of buying tea tree oil (:
3270 2018-11-15 18:24:58 What about the oil companies who stand to gain obscene profits by ignoring it? If you want to use a bullshit excuse at least think it through a little bit.
3271 2018-11-15 18:24:51 I went long on oil on tuesday and shorted nat gas yesterday. Cashed out for the week cause i feel smarter than i am and that's when you lose $$
3272 2018-11-15 18:24:49 By supporting a Canadian carbon tax while other countries don’t impose, this is exactly what the current government is saying.  Foreign oil ok, Canadian oil bad.  This is terrible.
3273 2018-11-15 18:24:46 When a oil pipeline needs repair we don’t just start dumping into the river or land. There are shut down and repair procedures to follow it’s not the Wild West like everyone thinks. Strict rules for every task we do.
3274 2018-11-15 18:24:45 We should not but it is a valuable commodity and although I like the idea of a green future the need for oil will be there for generations to come

3277 2018-11-15 18:24:21 The team was gutted so there wasn’t much way to improve this team other than prospect depth. The Reinhart trade still erks me but I’ve a feeling that move was pushed by the old boys club considering the Oil kings affiliation.

3282 2018-11-15 18:23:48 Yep, that’s true. We have crested 100 million barrels/day world wide. That number will only continue to grow. Sad that Canadian oil sector has been strangled by Ottawa and Left Coast. Sad for Canada to lose so much while Trudeau continues to pick our pockets, for non Canadians.
3283 2018-11-15 18:23:35 Today's #Morning Mojo Q&A:
Q: 59% of Americans say they couldn't do this if they had to.
A: Check the oil in their vehicle.
Congrats to listener Marco! He picks up a Subway Gift Card and tickets to see the new movie "Instant Family" at Metropolitan Theatres.
3284 2018-11-15 18:23:26 I saw it lol
3285 2018-11-15 18:23:26 But you’re pushing oil prices down, which kills our independent oil companies and jobs, and any chance of energy independence, also critical for national security. Makes our Saudi “allies” happy.
3286 2018-11-15 18:23:11 The way this Mallam was dipping my suya in oil, will I still be alive by tomorrow?
3287 2018-11-15 18:23:10 Such a hypocritical province. Don’t want Canadian oil but will dump shit in their Rivers. @TourismQuebec remind me never to visit
3288 2018-11-15 18:22:53 “Selling snake oil and expensive feelings to bored rich women” is the best description of GOOP ever, and highly accurate.
3289 2018-11-15 18:22:34 If only Calgary could wean off its dependence on the oil sector with a movement to a greener economy. Someone’s been mentioning something about that...

3291 2018-11-15 18:22:11 The ppl on my fb who are sharing these palm oil posts are the same ppl who say veganism is “extreme” and probably won’t even avoid buying palm oil 
3292 2018-11-15 18:22:11 You can tell if someone is racist or not by how they pronounce “oil”
3293 2018-11-15 18:22:05 no expensive oil rig needed a support ship and a tanker could do this.
3294 2018-11-15 18:21:58 Try cbd oil!
3295 2018-11-15 18:21:55 That’s why oil prices are down?
Haven’t seen any cheap prices here still around 2,98
3296 2018-11-15 18:21:46 WTI oil at $56.36/barrel, +$0.15.

3299 2018-11-15 18:21:40 Agreed. The strongest argument against my solution of starting by destroying one arbitrary oil company is that it is unfair to that one company. But regulation works no better than taxes. The IPCC graph of fossil fuel energy should be a step function.
3300 2018-11-15 18:21:39 Layer your serum and moisturizer a couple times, seal in with an oil or an occlusive. I also like the rich moisturizer from Glossier for the winter, sealed with squalene or jojoba.

3307 2018-11-15 18:20:32 SNP has never run either island and they would have claim to a lot of oil. Not a bit.

See how you're not so keen when the boots on the other foot
3308 2018-11-15 18:20:27 I would like to pick two of these flavours but have just discovered they contain palm oil 
3309 2018-11-15 18:20:26 That what?
3310 2018-11-15 18:20:24 #AmericaRecyclesDay How much hamburger grease and spray tan oil could get out of Trump?
3311 2018-11-15 18:20:24 so as the tanker sized bathyscaphe because full of oil, or gas.  The weights release and it floats to the surface of the ocean where the oil and gas can be transferred.  Billion dollar idea and the ocean is yours. Vacuum tubes can follow the weights down and suck up minerals etc
3312 2018-11-15 18:20:23 Hair tips for 4C hair:

Shear butter and oil mixture

3313 2018-11-15 18:20:21 How's that now? How else can you say the US started it, without citing that the US started it? "America stated the war in Iraq, but Europe started it"? You make no sense. You started that war so you could steal their oil, that's a fact. That was the only piece put into place.
3314 2018-11-15 18:20:19 Enough with political leaders talking about what oil prices should be.  You know what should determine oil price?  The cost to drill the f'n hole, then the most efficient assets will supply the market.
3315 2018-11-15 18:20:17 So. Everybody in the triangle goes to get their oil changed on cold rainy days? When did that become a thing? #flattirehell
3316 2018-11-15 18:20:17 *Just" oil dependence? The US economy needs oil the way we need air 2 breathe. So there's no "just" about it in any sense of the word until we achieve energy Independence. 

On average we consume + 17 billion barrels a day. Cost: one trillion two hundred forty-one billion.

3323 2018-11-15 18:19:57 After decades of vast subsidies, including from the rest of the UK, transfers from oil & gas revenues, massive price supports, and with a huge gas-back up capacity in place, on top of larger grid inter-links, for a region with tiny own population. Not a ground breaking reality…

3325 2018-11-15 18:19:37 The problem with the oil patch is that it is not in southern Ontario or Quebec.
3326 2018-11-15 18:19:34 It has something to do with the oil secretions from your genitalia. And there’s usually moisture there, especially for women so i believe that makes a difference.
3327 2018-11-15 18:19:30 We're committed to using only the most sustainable sources of palm oil in our products. We have removed it wherever possible and 100% of the palm oil used in M&S products is RSPO certified.
3328 2018-11-15 18:19:20 True, and  @JebBush would have equaled the bland choice offered in 08, 12.

3352 2018-11-15 18:16:44 As an American veteran this absolutely fucking disgusts me that they would even entertain the idea to trade an innocent man for money and oil.

3356 2018-11-15 18:16:27 Climate Change money? The only ones paying climate change money is big oil. And their "scientists" couldn't make it in the field and left tobecome paid hacks for right wing print media. Real scientists are not paid well and survive on grants. Being a shill for oil is lucrative.

3359 2018-11-15 18:16:17 Saudi Arabia gone kill 5 assasins for following the prince's orders. Possibly just picked fall guys even. America can put the press on the Saudis and they're letting them slide. No more weapons sales without oil negotiations. Do it quietly tho...

3377 2018-11-15 18:15:01 Trump doesn't know a lot about many things...He is a good snake oil salesman...He is good at not paying his bills...He is good at using the civil court system to screw others.
3378 2018-11-15 18:14:45 The thing that I love most about what I do is I can work from anywhere that I have an internet connection! Even in a lineup to get an oil and tire change. #entrepreneurlife
3379 2018-11-15 18:14:45 "You could always just have someone rub your butt will oil first. It looks jiggly enough that you should be able to just slip them right inside!"
3380 2018-11-15 18:14:43 The SNP Scotgov has done more for Shetland & Orkney than any prior administration. Support for independence for those isles is miniscule, there is no movement for it. If they want it, they can have it, SNP wouldn't stand in their way (Oil is Scotland's by the way)
3381 2018-11-15 18:14:40 I need to learn how to do my own damn oil change.
3382 2018-11-15 18:14:35 Can you do a quick Google search and show me the line in the budget where the Canadian government buys Saudi oil. I'll wait...
3383 2018-11-15 18:14:34 I have Argan oil shipped from Morocco so unless you tryna sail the seas to get me more, keep out.
3384 2018-11-15 18:14:29 Things like appointing another oil minister so as to increase the price of crude per barrel. Oil price and production is rising now so expect our economic growth to strengthen, there ain't no rocket science to quickly fix our economy once oil price is down n no cash in reserve

Irving Oil is privately owned.
3399 2018-11-15 18:12:53 The sebaceous glands in your scalp naturally make the oils your hair needs but they get rinsed away every time you wash. When you over wash it makes your scalp dry causing the glands to work over time producing MORE oil than necessary

3402 2018-11-15 18:12:24 in @BiggBossTamil2 one hm got brown eggs, olive oil, separate bathroom, buffalo milk etc & @BiggBoss would say it is exclusively for her. This was sent week on week until she got evicted. So if @sreesanth36 gets eggs that he doesnt have to share it is nothing.
3403 2018-11-15 18:12:20 There is no such thing as exactly fair trade. It's a much bigger system contingent on other factors. Also, it fluctuates all the time.  Tariffs fall in and out of favor, countries make deals with each other. Saudi Arabia sells us oil, they buy our weapons. Stuff like that

3407 2018-11-15 18:12:03 While your helping with my pity party, maybe you can console me about having to put nasty gas and changing the oil in my past cars too.  I’m going to have to say those were more frustrating ‘maintenance items’ than rubbing a little grease on my seals. Huge design flaws!
3408 2018-11-15 18:11:57 Whatever wealth is owned by the Vatican belongs to the faithful people of God, not to you or your cronies. The traitor Judas Iscariot wanted to sell the holy oil poured onto Jesus’ feet too. Of course he was a thief too, and wanted the money for himself.
3409 2018-11-15 18:11:50 I super recommend getting an essential oil diffuser necklace. They are like $12 on Amazon and come with interchangeable felt pads. You could spritz them with other scents too.
3410 2018-11-15 18:11:44 I take CBD oil orally (my state is wierd). It helps SO MUCH. OMFG.
3411 2018-11-15 18:11:37 Hmm interesting, maybe just another fad oil? Think I’ll give it a miss.

By the way Trump didn't help that candidate...
Something about the need for checks and balances as GOP Congress doesn't do its job,
Oh and Trump's threats of oil drilling on our coastline, the threats to our healthcare, the tax bill which hurts CA,
3433 2018-11-15 18:09:01 Definitely with the olives, quite a few people are doing it, you get a bottle of oil and the chance to visit your tree!

3444 2018-11-15 18:07:41 Did you know that unused oil tanks are more likely to leak? When a tank is left empty, it’s much more prone to the condensation and corrosion that will lead to leaks. Even if they’re empty, odds are good that there’s toxic sludge leftover at the bottom.
3445 2018-11-15 18:07:33 Build a refinery! Better plan! Cheap oil will support costs!!!

3448 2018-11-15 18:07:22 @oasimmons told me that to check oil you look at the mileage

3452 2018-11-15 18:06:39 @CNBC You are quick to criticize our @POTUS but never emphasize how much it costs to produce a barrel of oil! Who is tricking who? Perhaps you should read @POTUS's books instead of the communist script your bosses give you? #IdiotsOnParade
3453 2018-11-15 18:06:32 Dude hasn’t changed his oil in 4 years lmao
3454 2018-11-15 18:06:31 Dogs can be trained to smell gunpowder, oil and gunpowder residue. Same principle as the bomb detection dogs at the o2 arena that walk past me with a bag fulla loud but would clart a terrorist instantly.
3455 2018-11-15 18:06:26 They gave Harper a pass on pretty much everything because oil was selling at above $100/barrel but did nothing to prepare Alberta for global market fluctuations even though he ran on a platform of diversifying Calgary’s economy but never followed through on anything.
3456 2018-11-15 18:06:15 Fasted growing indeed. With all the looting a d borrowing going on then to pay workers monthly abi? Or abi with the oil boom money that was squandered by all @OfficialPDPNig and it cohorts? Where is madueke?

3458 2018-11-15 18:06:02 What about palm oil???
3459 2018-11-15 18:06:00 Of course not! I mean only oils that are produced through several processes in a technologically advanced factory. Olive oil is ancient
3460 2018-11-15 18:05:58 This country needs to put its foot down and ban palm oil, we don't need it!

3472 2018-11-15 18:04:52 We hear you. This is a really important issue and we’ve been driving industry-wide change for more than 15 years.  We’re on track to meet our goal of sourcing 100% physically certified palm oil by the end of 2019.
3473 2018-11-15 18:04:52 In today’s Manitoba NDP alternative throne speech I announced we would end subsidies for the oil and gas industry, starting with eliminating the tax credit for oil and gas drill bits

3487 2018-11-15 18:03:14 One of the biggest gripes I have is that the brand of butter I usually buy is expensive compared to other brands. But the reason why I buy it is because other brands of butter (and margarine) can be too soft and includes palm oil (probably why they're cheap).
3488 2018-11-15 18:03:09 and oilbus oil too
3489 2018-11-15 18:03:02 I see how easy They climb it !!!! Put oil and or lots of grease  so they will slide and stay on the other side !!!
3490 2018-11-15 18:03:02 Do they? We buy Pip n Nuts and Meridian. Both say ‘No Palm Oil’ Good spot on whole earth. Although @Greenpeace supports sustainable Palm Oil bec. They know if we stop buying Palm Oil some other crop will be planted & the cycle will start again. The problem is too many humans.
3491 2018-11-15 18:02:47 Or just not buying palm oil...

3494 2018-11-15 18:02:35 Probably Araujo has deep connections to the oil industry under the “diplomat” cover. These types of Latin American politicians work not because of true personal convictions but for the grabs, most times repaying old favors (consulting services). Time will only tell.
3495 2018-11-15 18:02:22 Tj, you have no idea what my situation is...my husband works in the oil patch and has not been working. A yes was perhaps an opportunity to actually change that with the influx of construction jobs. So before you QUESTION MY EMPATHY....maybe YOU should think!
3496 2018-11-15 18:02:13 You know her, like her and that's it, without any analysis of her efficacy, which is atrocious under every objective metric.

3498 2018-11-15 18:02:07 Watching 'the chaser'& there was a question " Which health supplement is sold as 'burp-less'" The contestant chose Vit C tablets the other choices protein powder or Omega 3 fish oil (correct answer) the chaser got it right & said as a Doc he didn't know why,Really Doc? D'oh
3499 2018-11-15 18:02:02 My oil changes haven't been anywhere that expensive! In fact, for the first 50,000 miles I had a bumper-to-bumper warranty and never pulled out my wallet!

I really don't know where to begin with how wrong you are. I'm almost speechless.
3543 2018-11-15 17:58:54 Russia wants to sell oil. Alternative energy is scaring them.
3544 2018-11-15 17:58:42 The app is called “Oil Price Live”
3545 2018-11-15 17:58:42 It sounds like some dumb shit but I have an essential oil blend that works sooo good and drinking a caffeinated cup of tea
3546 2018-11-15 17:58:40 Just asking for curiousity, were You able to predict Mikko's ceiling? I knew he was good, but I didn't see this coming... Also the Avs fans were qriticizing Mikko with rather similar failings as Jesse is now by the Oilers fans (clumsiness on skates etc.)...
3547 2018-11-15 17:58:26 Nope! That’s one of the only oils you should avoid at all costs. Mineral oil is resistant to polymerization, meaning it will remain liquid over time and when exposed to high temps, so you will not develop good seasoning with it. Once applied to a pan, it will also…
3548 2018-11-15 17:58:26 reminds me of $BP oil Spill. Soon a nice buying oppty might emerge
3549 2018-11-15 17:58:22 just chopped up with oil or butter on low to medium heat. I also used the wrong word kind of. I meant sweat. by which I mean to slowly cook the onion and vegetables at a gentle temperature so before adding the protein and other stuff for the stew/soup/sauce.
3550 2018-11-15 17:58:19 Oh no!!! #Twiglets have got #palmoil in them. @McVities please reformulate... I don't want to buy ANYTHING with palm oil in.
#PalmOilFree
3551 2018-11-15 17:58:04 I love the look down not up approach of this.

Not greedy oil & coal companies.

Greedy scientists and nonprofits.
3552 2018-11-15 17:58:03 Snake Oil
3553 2018-11-15 17:57:27 Spare a thought for your Alberta brothers and sisters whose oil is selling for $12 a barrel while the Saudis are getting $65 from your Ont and Que brothers and sisters.
3554 2018-11-15 17:57:17 ดีนะ พน. หยุด สติไม่ค่อยมี
3555 2018-11-15 17:57:11 
3556 2018-11-15 17:57:08 Oh, please. Chavez nationalized the oil industry, foreign businesses and almost everything else.
3557 2018-11-15 17:57:07 Were only people water soluble like Elmers Glue and Fudd.  
But those pesky oil based elements fuck that all up too. 
:)
3558 2018-11-15 17:57:06 I just got my last oil change for the year.. 2018 went by real fast.
3559 2018-11-15 17:57:06 Has anyone ever used CBD oil for anxiety?
3560 2018-11-15 17:57:04 "Peter Boghassian encourages children to drink motor oil " - buzzfeed headline
3561 2018-11-15 17:57:03 especially if you're thinking of deep frying it!  frozen turkey in gallons of hot oil do not mix well
3562 2018-11-15 17:57:01 Especially Vitamin C and Cloves!!! There really is no excuse, especially because even many of their “products “ include these ingredients.  Like oraJel.  Contains the extremely effective clove oil.

3564 2018-11-15 17:56:59 All a bih needs is some coconut oil 
3565 2018-11-15 17:56:44 Oil prices have also dropped steeply in the last 2 weeks which should help the country further.
3566 2018-11-15 17:56:42 Deriving some comfort from the fact that at least JRM will be annoyed as all hell after that press conference. Get out the castor oil, nanny, moggy didn’t get his 48 letters. ... but then, I remember Brexit is still happening and weep.
3567 2018-11-15 17:56:36 It's not Cda's oil; just like Que hydro is not Cda's

3569 2018-11-15 17:56:05 So many people accuse scientists of making money off of climate change - the same people who would never think of accusing oil companies of doing the same.
3570 2018-11-15 17:55:54 2038! Who owns Seplat oil?
3571 2018-11-15 17:55:46 @petreleaf  I have 3/4 of my bottle of hemp oil 1700 remaining and I cannot get the bottle to open despite 10 min of pressing down and turning- almost broke my wrist!  Use it to calm my  support dog down when flying but I could open the bottle.  can I get a replacement ?
3572 2018-11-15 17:55:45 The unwanted oil oh 
3573 2018-11-15 17:55:34 I would love this as an oil painting...”A Study in Motion: Futbol”

3576 2018-11-15 17:55:24 haha!  It's all BIG RENEWABLE money.  Those massive solar power energy utilities that rake in trillions of dollars and have a vested interest in keeping those small, plucky, upstart Oil and Gas companies down.
3577 2018-11-15 17:55:19 Next year nothing but black castor oil is going on my eyelashes and I’m done pulling them out
3578 2018-11-15 17:55:16 Licensed esthetician, here! Exfoliate with a gentle exfoliant like sugar, which is a humectant (locks in moisture.) Then steam ur face & finish w jojoba oil (which sinks in to your skin bc it's closest to our skin's natural oils!) If you need more than that, I suggest plain shea!
3579 2018-11-15 17:55:06 WTI will converge to Alberta oil price

3581 2018-11-15 17:54:57 Liberal attempts to phase out out oil and gas industry by over-regulation and failure to approve pipelines amounts to unwarranted invasion of provincial jurisdiction over resources. Meanwhile feds spend billions subsidizing eastern Cdn co.'s like Bombardier, Via rail, carmakers

3584 2018-11-15 17:54:33 I've always been skeptical of essential oils, but I'm taking an essential oil called Sudafed and it has knocked this cold right out.
3585 2018-11-15 17:54:31 I am actually a good cook, the oil betrayed me
3586 2018-11-15 17:54:30 But at least they'd still have the Saudi's and the Venezuelan's to get their oil from.
3587 2018-11-15 17:54:28 So Russia reports that Trump snuck in at least one secret meeting with Putin in Russia to fix price of oil. His Paris trip was slways for Putin not American War dead. #TrumpTraitor #PutinsPuppet
3588 2018-11-15 17:54:14 I lived most of my life in San Benito County, Hollister, CA.  A small group of anti fracking individuals were able to get a county initiative passed to ban fracking.  Oil/gas spent 2 million to defeat it and we won!  It can be done.
3589 2018-11-15 17:54:13 Try jojoba oil. I rub it in every night & am joyously flake free, back in navy blue polo shirts, & absolute catnip to the ladies.
3590 2018-11-15 17:54:11 I understand your perspective, and I value this conversation. Honestly it was mature-ish & I'm glad we kept it that way but it sucks to see all the arrogance from both parties.. Both dishes are oil down & idk the history of Grenadian OR Trinidad one & it's interesting lmao

The answer was No, CZK is simply too small ccy to trade in/use 4 trade

3599 2018-11-15 17:53:40 Bringing awareness to Palm Oil agricultural deforestation is immensely important. Also, this proves that with good practical effects you could make a movie 100 times better than the oversaturation  of CGI we see nowadays. At least a blend of the two.

3607 2018-11-15 17:52:50 Imagine the tax revenues that could be collected from oil produced in Canada if there was a pipeline built that allowed our oil to be exported to somewhere other than the US. Being captive to the US results in our oil being sold to the US for $12/bl while they sell theirs for $65
3608 2018-11-15 17:52:45 Lol girl go get some blessedt oil right TF now  have you seen insidious? Them shits be jumping into folks bodies  lemme find out you bout to be possessed.

3611 2018-11-15 17:52:32 Same way Amazon gets free property taxes and big oil gets free land to drill on. 
Taxpayers subsidize job creation all the time.
3612 2018-11-15 17:52:27 2. Early in life I learned of how many Americans benefited from electricity- living longer and much recreation plus much more because of electricity. As a kid I helped in the oil fields here in California, mainly in safety. I had a wonderful mind and I used it!!!
3613 2018-11-15 17:52:26 Feel yer pain. In 1991 following the offensive I spent two weeks in southern Iraq breathing crude oil smoke from burning oil fields. At high noon you couldn’t see 50 feet. Back in Germany a month later I was still spitting phlegm with streaks of soot, lungs were never the same.

3616 2018-11-15 17:52:09 Birchcliff Energy (BIR) Record multi-year decline in oil. Strategy would be to go with larger integrated companies. It's not a sector that we would strongly endorse.  Debt, transportation issues, no new money. Stick with the larger companies, start looking at the US.

3618 2018-11-15 17:51:34 Cannabis works for a lot of different pains. I have an Aunt that used to take 10 oxy’s a day for fibromyalgia. Now she uses CBD oil instead and it has worked amazingly. Of course she is under care of a Dr to get the doses right. I work in healthcare and see a lot of people using.

3623 2018-11-15 17:51:05 Here’s to hoping @Valvoline Instant Oil Change does the right thing. For whatever unknown reason when they were trying to replace a tail light they used a crowbar to pry off the tail light enclosure and shattered the enclosure on our nice highlander (1/3).

3630 2018-11-15 17:50:32 "no relevance beyond military necessity"? Tell that to the thousands of Polish officers murdered by Stalin, or the political prisoners exchanged between the NKVD and the Gestapo. Or the Jews murdered at Babi Yar.
You also missed the trade in grain, oil, and weapons.

3632 2018-11-15 17:50:16 All mayo is it oil whipped into a tiny amount of water (often egg white) with an emulsifier (often egg yolk). Now I’m going to really fuck up your day: Cool Whip is essentially sweet fluffy mayonnaise.

3637 2018-11-15 17:49:51 I think it's just a matter of preference. I use coconut oil for other basic skin and body care, so it's just become my homeopathic catch-all. Winter is the WORST for a hand-washer like me! If Eucerin works for you, go for it!

3644 2018-11-15 17:49:14 Don’t listen to anyone saying buy palmers. Palmers contains virtually no actual cocoa butter, but mineral oil which is TERRIBLE for your skin. You need an exfoliant and moisturizer. If it’s really bad, a moisture mask once a week following exfoliation is helpful.

3650 2018-11-15 17:48:42 How Trump-Modi orchestrated a crash in crude

3. Modi called Trump & convinced him to Exempt India from Iran sanction

4. Trump Agreed

3658 2018-11-15 17:47:50 @paulsinha normal fish oil tablets can result in revolving fishy burps. They’re literally fish oil inside a soluble capsule.  I’m assuming burp less have the active ingredient distilled without all the other fishy bits.

3661 2018-11-15 17:47:36 No, the big White House macro concern as Watergate dragged on was the 1973 Yom Kippur War, and the first oil embargo that followed it.
3662 2018-11-15 17:47:34 
The idiots are yet to come to terms with the fact that oil price has been decontrolled for a very long time now.
Riding and falling prices are not a concern when it’s pegged against actual market prices. 
The insane taxation on it by states though is still not newsworthy.
3663 2018-11-15 17:47:31 It’s not fealty, it’s money. We aren’t dependent on their oil, but we do like their money.
3664 2018-11-15 17:47:31 How poetic that a man who spends his "snake oil" career representing questionable accusers...gets falsely accused (according to him) for domestic violence. Karma's a bitch isn't it?

3676 2018-11-15 17:46:29 Because they have little regard for human life.  Also check out Aramco presence in oil refineries. Look deeper..follow fossil fuel $$$$$$$. Cheap energy is not always sustainable energy

3678 2018-11-15 17:46:28 From selling PMS at N87 to restructuring, then to 100% control of oil income by the oil producing states and then floating the Naira so that it can fly high in the sky...chai!! What next?
3679 2018-11-15 17:46:26 You know, any Trinidadian who say they don’t like oil down they lie.  Is basically curry and dumpling. Wam?
3680 2018-11-15 17:46:22 it's a more technical way of telling big oil lobbyist and other special interests to gtfo

but i will admit i was a little confused by it for a moment as well.
3681 2018-11-15 17:46:15 Another discovery? I thought oil was running out but here we are, one discovery after another.
3682 2018-11-15 17:46:14 Tea with coconut oil isn't bad at all.
3683 2018-11-15 17:46:12 Its too bad big oil has small minds at the top. What is big oil gonna do, when the world economy is destroyed by global atmospheric catastrophes?  The end, of world economys. Immense, global destruction! Grow an intelligent mind, or see the end! Your choice Scrooge!
3684 2018-11-15 17:45:59 #HockeyFightsCancer I fight for my aunt who is a survivor. I fight for my friend who runs each year in run for cure for the many people in his life affected by Cancer.  He is inspirational and loves Oilers and proudly would wear the toque.
3685 2018-11-15 17:45:49 An undiplomatic fellow who almost halted oil production in the Niger delta with his unguarded rhetorics of 97-5%.
A president without economic blueprint.
So where do u think the funds will come from...
I think u have amnesia or u chose to defend the obvious.
3686 2018-11-15 17:45:49 Thank goodness. Gillum is a snake oil salesman.
3687 2018-11-15 17:45:48 Could be it! I would cut it out for a week or two and see! Could be gluten or something else. I give her a tiny bit of cbd oil (sublingually) for her eczema. And I take it for anxiety, depression, irritability, and joint pain. Omg it has changed my life so much!

3689 2018-11-15 17:45:35 Don’t listen to me I got bald tires and 5000 miles past my oil change
3690 2018-11-15 17:45:26 Yo @jonnycraig4L coconut oil, stay hydrated, and theres also a lotion called egyptian magic. Check it out.
3691 2018-11-15 17:45:16 I kept thinking Bradley was saying “Omega 3 for sure” and thought he was rubbing it in how wrong she was, until I looked up and read it said Omega 3 fish oil!  #TheChase
3692 2018-11-15 17:45:05 And, as for the physical side, I second the suggestion of lavender oil and counting backward from 100 to help focus the mind and provide the body with rest. I also suggest Epsom salt baths. I found the bath helpful after a couple of days dealing with anxiety about a situation.
3693 2018-11-15 17:45:00 Yes Eric we are there are many other countries we can buy oil from
3694 2018-11-15 17:44:58 I would assume nobody wants to be burping fish oil all day ewww #TheChase
3695 2018-11-15 17:44:58 Because if you burp having taken fish oil it repeats on you, obv @paulsinha. Garlic capsules are marketed the same. #TheChase
3696 2018-11-15 17:44:57 The female mindset or the guido who’s all oil’d up? How much time u got?
3697 2018-11-15 17:44:52 I don’t feel like it should take this long to get my oil changed :/
3698 2018-11-15 17:44:42 Why are oil changes so expensive lol?
3699 2018-11-15 17:44:39 Fish oil tablets are notorious for making you burp.  No one wantsa repeat of fish oil again and again

3707 2018-11-15 17:44:22 @ITVChase I thought that was an obvious answer...who wants to be burping fish oil all day?!? #TheChase
3708 2018-11-15 17:44:21 The man at pepboys was like your tires are completely bald, you're in need of alignment, you need a new air filter and you need new windshield wipers, on top of the oil change I came in for he said the total was 413 I said yeah I'll take the wipers and oil change 
3709 2018-11-15 17:43:58 Hidden in this is that Trump's sanctions on Iran have nothing to do with Iran breaking agreement and everything to do with raising price of oil to help Putin. Last paragraph.
3710 2018-11-15 17:43:48 African Black Soap can be great for acne but it also can dry out the skin big time, that’s why it’s recommended to use Shea Butter or Jojoba Oil with it
3711 2018-11-15 17:43:45 As soon as I get a haircut, my inner lightskin kick in. I start exfoliating my skin, putting on lip balm, using beard oil, putting coconut oil in my hair, brushing my eyebrows and shit.... But as soon as I start looking rough, that whole regimen go out the window 
3712 2018-11-15 17:43:29 And also welcome back. May Allah accept your Umrah
3713 2018-11-15 17:43:27 What changed was a carbon pricing proposal meant to engage ALL Canadians in a common purpose to earn export revenues from oil by shipping to China from tidewater, so we can invest in infrastructure to get to a low-carbon economy. Reds, Blues and Greens together. #cdnpoli
3714 2018-11-15 17:43:25 this reminds me of those biryanis where there's more oil than rice

3719 2018-11-15 17:43:04 Anyone is more qualified then that, big oil, big pharma pimp.  She's made so much off of us and war.  I'm silly enough to think putting the people & country before your bank account makes one qualified.
3720 2018-11-15 17:42:59 Burts Bees facial oil!
3721 2018-11-15 17:42:58 So when your @OfficialPDPNig had an all time 120$/barrel of crude oil,where were those funds?Now that we had less that 40$/barrel at some point&now at 70$/barrel yet Pmb grew foreign reserves, pdp imported everything thus killing our local industries,SMEs,wont go low on the forex
3722 2018-11-15 17:42:54 I miss my old car because I didn’t have to spend a billion dollars on a synthetic oil change
3723 2018-11-15 17:42:48 Just for your info...
In the article it says: "China needs Alberta oil..." 
Did anyone do any research on who owns Alberta Oil? To assume that Canadians do would be a big mistake. How about the Chinese etc

3727 2018-11-15 17:42:00 Next stop, oil fields
3728 2018-11-15 17:41:54 Just be careful with terminology. Red palm oil (from the pulp) is an essential ingredient in many tropical cuisines, is healthy, and can be produced sustainably.
3729 2018-11-15 17:41:40 I mean, Libya was a pretty clear regional powerplay, as was the calculus of how they chose to go about it. Syria was, as well, just bafflingly half-assed. Iraq, there really doesn't seem much logic to it, at all. And the oil argument  is bogus.
3730 2018-11-15 17:41:33 Hahaha coconut oil haha when last did I hear that one
3731 2018-11-15 17:41:33 It’s castor oil sis
3732 2018-11-15 17:41:21 I love @kroger click list, but it also offers it's own surprises when I get home...

I got how many ice creams? 

I guess I got the tiny bottle of olive oil. 

I thought I was ordering one clump of tomatoes.. not one lonely tomato?

3751 2018-11-15 17:39:30 We'll find out soon enough, perhaps. I think China is already buying oil with the yuan and I'm sure a lot of other countries would like to follow suit.

3771 2018-11-15 17:36:50 Things have changed now and most minimum wage jobs are not done by teenagers. There are a certain amount of safety hazards working around hot oil and how quickly people are expected to work. Also if they are paid substandard wages then they have to get welfare and food stamps 1

3773 2018-11-15 17:36:41 The US has fracked themselves & the world oil industry. Too much cheap oil is available lots of it is nearly ready to be classed as gasoline. Like in the Megantic disaster.
3774 2018-11-15 17:36:36 gotcha - i let rise overnight, folded this am, proofed, then folded again, now in for second proofing before final fold, rise and bake 60% white, 40% whole wheat - yeast, salt, a little oil for fat (my loaves have been kind of meh lately) and some honey
3775 2018-11-15 17:36:35 Imagine what it would be like if we actually had pipelines to sell our oil at market value.

3779 2018-11-15 17:36:03 Serious Q though for @DiMartinoBooth , if the US is more self-reliant (produces the oil it uses, mfgs rather than imports), do we have an idea of the impact of such a mandated $ deval vs. gold?
3780 2018-11-15 17:36:03 OPEC raised the price of oil and has continued to raise the price since the 1970s because we support Israel.

3783 2018-11-15 17:35:43 Then someone please tell me why we even bother with the Middle East? Since we don't need their oil?

3795 2018-11-15 17:34:24 Hey Natalie :) We're committed to using only the most sustainable sources of palm oil in our products. We have removed it wherever possible and 100% of the palm oil used in M&S products is RSPO certified. 1/2
3796 2018-11-15 17:34:21 Do they mean they don’t want to buy our oil, water, electricity, whisky after we decide to run our own affairs. Sounds a bit surly. Oh well if they feel they must

3803 2018-11-15 17:33:26 The vast majority of palm oil is sold as palm kernels for animal feed & as biofuels. Giving up meat would reduce palm oil production by around 36%. Human food uses about 25% of world supply.  Very little of that food is #vegan. Google palm kernel animal feed statistics.

3807 2018-11-15 17:32:58 Grow up. The al-Saud rule because of support by the US. When their rule becomes so brutal & stupid as to destabilize their country, they threaten the global oil supply and are no longer an asset. MBS needs to go, if the Ahl al-Saud wants to remain an absolute Monarchy.
3808 2018-11-15 17:32:58 I AM USING OIL
3809 2018-11-15 17:32:56 Which kind? Sativa makes me anxious but strong strains of indica Help me so much! I wanna get a Vape for oil.
3810 2018-11-15 17:32:47 No! You keep basting while grilling and have leftover sauce to cover it. I’m not allowed to give away the recipe of the sauce but it involves apple sauce vinegar, cracked red pepper, mustard, extra virgin olive oil, and mesquite salt. All I can say
3811 2018-11-15 17:32:40 my hands are shivering and i just put hot oil on my currently discolored ankle - the aftermath of the euphoria that is #BurnTheStageTheMovie but i feel.. happy. i think content could even be the perfect word to describe this feeling, thank you for making this possible @BTS_twt

3813 2018-11-15 17:32:28 Kasih castrol oil aja kalo gitu, biar ga seret
3814 2018-11-15 17:32:22 Due to family's cooking style (no oil except little olive oil, no sugar, nearly no salt), having meals outside appears to be a kind of 'torture' to me: too salty, too fat, too sweet...
3815 2018-11-15 17:32:19 Canadian gov bailed out $bbd.b But is watching the oil CO’s just bleed what a joke lol
3816 2018-11-15 17:32:14 For example I just got and oil change and a full tank lol
3817 2018-11-15 17:31:59 I not saying you need to know how to change your own oil but you need to know how to at least check it.....

3824 2018-11-15 17:31:21 I am liberal and Trump is a disaster. But Jesus Fucking Christ some of you people make me want to vote for him out of spite. Like I'm not going to because that's like shooting off your dick when someone calls you ugly, but I can totally see why someone otherwise indifferent would
3825 2018-11-15 17:31:05 As violent and unevolved as tribal Saudi Arabia was , is now and may ever be...add the power of oil $$$ and the groveling of Trump.
3826 2018-11-15 17:31:05 The government of Uzbekistan has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Gerard Butler in a fustian wig.
3827 2018-11-15 17:31:05 The point is that harming pigs because you enjoy eating them is no different from harming dogs because you enjoy beating them. If a person who beats dogs was going on about palm oil, you WOULD point out the senselessness in that.
3828 2018-11-15 17:31:04 Its also full of Palm Oil and should be boycotted
3829 2018-11-15 17:30:58 Without oil royalties, how do you plan on paying for health care and all the other perks Canadians get?

3831 2018-11-15 17:30:44 Was quite a solid mixture. But had to be handled carefully. Looked like ordinary sossies. Had to be fried in a splash of olive oil. 2 mins either side. Revolting.
3832 2018-11-15 17:30:42 we don't need tarsands to continue using or transition from fossil fuels. subsidizing tarsands and infrastructure to move bitumen works against that transition and against our future. we must stop subsidizing the dirtiest and least efficient form of oil extraction

3834 2018-11-15 17:30:34 @wwf_uk to urge companies to use sustainable palm oil (or preferably none at all), maybe a universal script would be useful to put on your website to assure we’re using the right words for better results. just an idea 
3835 2018-11-15 17:30:32 with the Kashoggi murder and the arms deal... people need to remember 15 out of 19 911 hijackers were Saudis, the US and the world still NEED their oil to function, they can get away with anything.

3838 2018-11-15 17:30:18 Hi Heather, We are pleased to say Hotel Chocolat is on track to be palm oil free across all chocolate manufacturing by the end of 2019. We’ve never used palm oil in our chocolate, yet small amounts come indirectly from added ingredients, such as biscuits. Part 1/2
3839 2018-11-15 17:30:11 I doubt oil prices will go up again coz Democrats r in charge of the House in the US n keeping Trump on check.

3841 2018-11-15 17:30:01 Obviously you don’t take much interest in the oil and gas sector!
3842 2018-11-15 17:29:55 Drove to three different places just to get my oil changed  I’m starving
3843 2018-11-15 17:29:50 How about Australia selling seeds of a tree that excretes a flammable oil to California?
3844 2018-11-15 17:29:40 But if that’s what we call it what you want me to call it. That’s what it is to trinis.... I have tried your oil down. I still call it oil down. Two different dishes same fucking name

3846 2018-11-15 17:29:24 Crude oil should be going down on this news but is being held up by short covering and the cold weather in the eastern part of the US causing increasing winter demand. Today WTI is up for the second day after 12 days going down. It is at up US$0.63/b to US$56.88/b.
3847 2018-11-15 17:29:18 If only we had an oil fund.
3848 2018-11-15 17:29:13 I agree Christian but I'll have to suck it up because I like where I live

We lived off the coat tails of the oil and gas industry for too many years and that is why the city and province are in a pickle
3849 2018-11-15 17:29:10 Mostly undifferentiated commodities (like meat or oil) compete mostly on price, and slightly on quality. The only way lab meat "takes over" is if it becomes cheaper while offering the same or better quality, and thus making factory farms obsolete. Economics.
3850 2018-11-15 17:29:05 *guy at the car shop pulls out the oil stick in my car*
Guy: does it look good?

3853 2018-11-15 17:28:18 So all my life I’ve struggled with acne. Nothing ever worked, & even the dermatologist couldn’t get it under control.
Since I’ve started using tea tree oil & witch hazel my skin has improved drastically! I’m finally comfortable in my own skin & don’t coat on makeup.
3854 2018-11-15 17:28:17 I’ve done that too! I’ve also shaved my legs with baby oil!
3855 2018-11-15 17:28:11 "My thanks goes specifically to Gov. Mohammad Badaru for sending me N100.000 & Dutse council chairman for the gift of N15.000 & two bags of rice,one carton of Spaghetti,& a gallon of cooking oil,”-What they gave the father of the guy who was electrocuted hoisting Gov & PMB's flag
3856 2018-11-15 17:28:10 The fries at my work cafe are AMAZING! So today I asked the chef what they do differently to make them so good, because they aren't seasoned. His response? "We use clean oil. It's changed twice a day."

Welp. That'll do it, I guess.

3862 2018-11-15 17:27:46 better ways would be use a clean energy tax to facilitate building wind -solar and tidal energy farms....offer incentives to oil companies to help develop clean energy farms..

3866 2018-11-15 17:27:23 And no one will care about your province when it is doing poor. Keep your Saudi oil.

3870 2018-11-15 17:26:48 India: Trade deficit reached $17.1bn in Oct, vs $14bn in Sep. Oct exports rose 17.9% yoy to $27bn. Imports rose 17.6% to $44.1bn. Oil imports were valued at $14.2bn versus $10.9bn in Sep
INR (-/=), Sensex Nifty (v/=) *But suspected seasonality, tactically timed oil imports
3871 2018-11-15 17:26:42 Scary that @Clearcast will not let us use media to talk about the ways that us consumers are spurring the expansion of #PalmOil and how these palm oil plantations kill orangutans, not to mention tens of thousands of more species of life.
3872 2018-11-15 17:26:25 At least oil hayichina nyaya these days. We are going green y'all

3874 2018-11-15 17:26:07 Lemmi tell you what these our friends in Lakeside are doing; they take a CD, wipe all the oil then put in the phone and tie the top tightly. That way, even when drowning the phone will still work. Perfectly water resistant. Hii mambo ya iPhone in porojo tu.

3881 2018-11-15 17:25:27 I am talking about the oil prices and the fact Canada gets $40 less a barrel. Oil recession.
3882 2018-11-15 17:25:19 BC had we not bought the KM pipeline there would NO oil at all going to the west coast. KM backed out and no other private company made an offer
3883 2018-11-15 17:25:08 Not content with the #SugarTax @juanwatterson wants to tax Palm Oil. He must be really worried about his public service pension with its £3.5bn shortfall #CostOfLiving #iomstory

3894 2018-11-15 17:23:30 Want to get the oil out?  My engine is the only thing that will do it.  How?  Read the tweets and lets discuss.  80-95% of the oil gone, leading to Nat Gas and then H2 at $1/gal.  Try 200 mpg cars, roadable airplanes at 200 mph at 3 cents/mile fuel.  Not electric.  No bat needed.
3895 2018-11-15 17:23:17 @Cadbury_SA please advise on whether Cadbury South Africa uses sustainably sourced palm oil or otherwise?
3896 2018-11-15 17:23:15 You know.. a garage. A place. Cause if we change our oil in the parking spot in our apt we actually get fined. .

3898 2018-11-15 17:23:06 the iceland advert is cute and good and everything but even though they say they’re eliminating palm oil from their own brand products, they’ve not said they’re going to stop selling branded products that contain palm oil so??? performative nonsense yet again

3904 2018-11-15 17:22:44 We bought the mighty S 400 from Russia, we continue to import crude oil from Iran, and we are still a favoured nation to US without them sanctioning us under CAATSA. Thats Modi’s foreign policy to our beloved India....

3910 2018-11-15 17:22:25 Not only are you wrong when you say health issues prevent many people from going vegan, but you're also being dishonest: you KNOW that most people talking about palm oil choose to consume animal products for palate pleasure.

Stop being such an apologist.

3922 2018-11-15 17:21:23 Being tough on crime means trying to eliminate the things that cause crime, not cutting the programs that do so and wasting billions on "reforms" that actually increase crime and cost more money in the long run taking care of all those extra prisoners.
3923 2018-11-15 17:21:23 Any palm oil?
3924 2018-11-15 17:21:21 Also, there are probably more small-scale producers in your area than you realize. I can’t get (or afford) all local stuff, but I can get a lot. Soap, lotion, meats, yarn, eggs, canned goods, stationery, beer, wine, cheese, olive oil, all from within 100 miles of my house.
3925 2018-11-15 17:21:21 You’re an embarrassment!  You’re government protects regimes and works arms deals, imports dirty oil and has the audacity to call out those that oppose you!  Sickening! #Handtalker #hypocrite

3934 2018-11-15 17:20:11 Great post, as always. That level of service would make me feel better spending over $100 for an oil change. That hasn’t been my experience.

I’d be curious what really motivated these enhancements. Those of us in less competitive markets are lucky to get a water fountain.
3935 2018-11-15 17:20:10 After seeing that Jill Scott demonstration...I can see why @JoeBudden heats up the oil in the microwave & lights the candles. You wasn’t buggin my G.
3936 2018-11-15 17:19:57 ... at least the palm oil is used to make "carbon neutral" bio-diesel, so no need for the forests. Ironic?
3937 2018-11-15 17:19:53 Again, they are just the workers, Ryan Zeke is head of the Interior. He is the one who controls what the forest service can do and he is to busy spending money on trips home and working for the oil companies. Plus again trump reduced the forest service budget.

3940 2018-11-15 17:19:38 I planted more seeds this week in the #Cannasector #Cannavestor #Cannafolio w/oil short proceeds (all out $DWT today). Those seeds in addition to already planted ones will produce a beautiful garden in the future. We're eyes on the US. We're going to do 10-20 baggers like Canada
3941 2018-11-15 17:19:31 Editors and owners lean strongly right. Talking heads do as they are told for pay, just as workers who want to protect the environment in private lives still do what oil executives say if they work at BP. 

There is no documentation of a slogan driving voters away from voting D.

3946 2018-11-15 17:19:00 I dont use it anymore no, it was fun and I did bring in a nuru bed once .. but I use coconut oil now mostly for the massage (unscented). I can’t believe I met you that soon after I started working at muse ! That’s amazing you remember #sosweet #loveulongtime

3952 2018-11-15 17:18:25 First time I have ever seen two big oil tankers jogging outside off Tors Cove 3-4 miles. Sheet of water are picking up off the surface by the wharf in W Bay. What is your position?

3954 2018-11-15 17:18:18 heh you know what just occurred to me? I got my oil changed the day Sessions got confirmed as AG, and got it changed 2 weeks before he was fired. Jeff Sessions: lasts longer than motor oil, but not much

"Mmm~
Garlic~"

He hums as he places the onions in the pan, than the peppers, followed by the garlic. 
He also adds a bit of vegetable oil, so it'll cook a little easier and not stick to the pan.
3958 2018-11-15 17:17:58 Come oil my scalp pls
3959 2018-11-15 17:17:56 Yes it is. Its a fracking disaster from Ft Stockton West to Balmorhea. Just waiting for the next storage units to burst into flames like the still smoldering ruins on the side of I10 from over a month ago... oil company greed only getting worse.

3965 2018-11-15 17:16:40 This is my experience. I have shingles. It’s so serious, that I am in constant pain. No pain killer or morphing my doctors prescribed could ease my pain. And I decide to try CBD oil. The pain is gone immediately.

3968 2018-11-15 17:16:28 Things like butter and coconut oil clog arteries, oils and fats like vegetable oil neither make it worse or better, and olive oil removes the clogs hope this helps you make better meal choices and eat healthier

America will be healed from this time of division, for Heaven will see to it that she will be healed and come into a deeper greatness. Will you be president when it happens?
3974 2018-11-15 17:15:52 Africans need to start with screaming "imperialism" at Britain, France, Spain and Portugal instead of the USA. They also need to take a look at the billions of dollars in oil revenue missing in Nigerian thanks to their own corrupt leaders.
3975 2018-11-15 17:15:51 @alexjonesshows You’re a bloated, deranged old idiot too busy selling your “miracle potions” and snake oil to ever read a book. And I wanted to know: I walked by MIT once, does that make me an alum? You suck tubby
3976 2018-11-15 17:15:46 Your scalp is probably currently used to being washed everyday and that's why it may be getting greasy so quickly. Eventually your scalp will get used to not being washed everyday, and not produce as much oil stuff. You can try using dry shampoo for a bit to control the grease :)

3979 2018-11-15 17:15:30 Well, and if you stop using Palm Oil, what will take its place? Something more destructive or something less destructive?

This said, it doesn’t have to be an either/or thing. You can be worried about both.
3980 2018-11-15 17:15:26 y la policía? Siguen con el verso de "no tenemos gas oil"?

3997 2018-11-15 17:13:57 What does 'well made' mean? I think there is a huge difference between ice cream made with cream, sugar, egg and a touch of vanilla compared to a product made with palm oil, high fructose corn syrup, some skimmed milk powder and a raft of artificial additives.

3999 2018-11-15 17:13:53 With the rest of the Government unconvinced over May’s divorce deal, Sterling dropped by over 1.5%. This caused UK-focused sectors such a banking stocks and housebuilders to fall, whilst the globally exposed, dollar earners such as mining, and oil & gas stocks rallied
4000 2018-11-15 17:13:50 What? War is big business. Controlled by Globalist. Oil, armory, politics etc. it has nothing to do with Nationalism. Globalist/Socialist are after one thing and one thing only. One world government with no independent governments left on the face of the earth.
4001 2018-11-15 17:13:49 It was a nightmare my brother...
4002 2018-11-15 17:13:48 Maybe grease, oil runs off.
4003 2018-11-15 17:13:37 Because excess power is the cheapest power. (such as remote dams not running at full capacity, or uncapped oil wells). You can't get a LOT of excess power, you can only get a little in sparsely spaced geolocations.
4004 2018-11-15 17:13:26 Oil price has trended higher due to secular increase of energy intensity of production & decline of EROEI. 1973 Oil Shock was about resilience: US needed high prices to fund high cost oil (Alaska, US Gulf, North Sea) to regain energy independence. 2009/2014 bubble same rationale

4009 2018-11-15 17:12:59 Texas growth is due to other sectors besides oil. It saw growth in technology, manufacturing, and service sectors. And pulling oil out of the ground is creating value. 

Kansas is an agriculture state. It's economy is much less varied. It has nothing to do with red/blue politics.

4037 2018-11-15 17:10:31 I’m all for nuclear. The environmentalists rejected that. Solar and wind fall far short and subsidizing them is throwing away money. If we can drink the water at the end of a sewage treatment plant, we can filter out real pollutants from using coal and oil. CO2 isn’t a pollutant.
4038 2018-11-15 17:10:20 Columbia Threadneedle Global Co-Head on Bloomberg TV just blamed oil price fall on White House telling Iran oil buyers that “there are waivers for pretty much anyone who wants it.” LOL crazy talk. US Sanctions will cut 1.1M b/d in Iran exports this month.

4075 2018-11-15 17:07:53 Exactly, Nancy. I am once again disappointed in the members of the gluten-free community who are finding it funny and dismissing our concerns. I have yet to have anyone tell me that replacing "gluten" with "peanut oil" would be funny though ...

4080 2018-11-15 17:07:37 LDN Daily Wrap

Missed most of morning  but;

- Pound huge drop on multiple resignations
- Theresa May about to speak
- Oil elevated despite big Build in DoE inventories 

Much could change in the upcoming moments
4081 2018-11-15 17:07:17 Really because of the mixture? I often put tea tee oil on my face but it’s never burned but I imagine how strong the clay is at pulling@it would
4082 2018-11-15 17:07:16 I just love working at #Gartner to help our clients with their #IoT and #DigitalTwin challenges / opportunities. These range from oil infrastructure DT development to monitoring chicken feces to architectural opportunities.
4083 2018-11-15 17:06:56 The harshness of your statement is baffling. Somebody is keeping our oil, and BTW, Canadian oil, from world markets, for their own benefit. Maybe madame, you could advise us on the function, and cause of that scheme?
4084 2018-11-15 17:06:49 So if a person who beats dogs told you they don't consume palm oil because they care about animals, you wouldn't tell them: "hey, if you care about animals, it makes no sense for you to abuse dogs"?

And you're the one who needs to understand that speciesism is wrong.

4092 2018-11-15 17:06:02 We're one, but we're not the same
Well, we go out to eat or maybe a movie, or rotate the tires & change the oil in the car, perhaps get a Slurpee at 7-11, milk the cows, then we do it again (but only on Tuesdays) 
4093 2018-11-15 17:05:56 A pot shot at supposedly pure veg BJP govt in MP & Oil Gas Eng fell for it. 
4094 2018-11-15 17:05:48 I’m trying (imperfectly, perhaps) to imply that we need to actively create a world where fewer are needed. An end to foreign wars for oil would be a great place to start.
4095 2018-11-15 17:05:47 Compte parodique... oil n’en reste pas moins qu’elle a dit avoir augmenté de 10 à 15% la rémunération de ses collaborateurs...en poste depuis 18 mois!!!!car ils travaillent bcp!
4096 2018-11-15 17:05:46 We must keep highlighting this terrible situation. Palm Oil is bad for US too. It's in the cheap peanut butter!
4097 2018-11-15 17:05:44 The capitalists rob the planet, rip it open for oil and gold, and leave us with nothing but labor.

It’s my Christmas present to myself.
4100 2018-11-15 17:05:07 The main contributing factor to the drop include a decline in the international oil price and the Rands relative strength against the US dollar.

4101 2018-11-15 17:05:05 Why is it so hard to find shampoo and conditioner without palm oil in it????????

4103 2018-11-15 17:05:02 Nvmd get your oil change and goooo
4104 2018-11-15 17:04:57 Are they cooked in oil or dry rubbed?
4105 2018-11-15 17:04:54 Indeed.

4107 2018-11-15 17:04:47 I don't get it. Why does the United States of America routinely bend over backward for the Saudis - both Democrats and Republicans - despite everything they've done to us?? Makes no sense. Can't just be about oil anymore. We owe them nothing.
4108 2018-11-15 17:04:44 The response from clearcast around the petition for the palm oil advert is complete bollocks, yes the advert is aligned to green peace, but the advert itself is showing truth, the only political thing about this is oppressing that truth. For what? What gain?

4118 2018-11-15 17:04:01 For most, November is punctuated with holiday cooking. Once the table has been cleared, we remind you to avoid disposing of used cooking oils down the drain. By disposing your oil this way, you can cause clogs & backups to your sewer system, which can result in costly repairs.
4119 2018-11-15 17:03:54 homemade- i mix sugar, vaseline & a tiny tiny drop of some type of oil. rub it on dry lips (works better with a toothbrush) wipe off with a washcloth & then put on chap stick.

or you can buy a scrub in any makeup store or drug store, Walmart, Target.. etc in the bath/cosmetics

However, the said money upon return had been agreed to be used for social investment programs... so what's your cry... at least your MCMs regime couldn't move to get it at all

4171 2018-11-15 16:58:30 We all know that is a lie.: If Niger Delta gets 100% of Oil money, a state like Lagos will want 100% of the CIT that Banks and Oil Companies pay to FG. and It will be so loop-sided that some states will not even have any money. The flip side is that Others will will sit up!

4190 2018-11-15 16:57:10 Her leadership strengths lie around fund raising, not around policy. She is beholden to Big Oil/pharma/ and her agenda reflects this. Her ability to control caucus is predicated upon the presence of DINOs in the house. These are not strengths the party needs right now, IMO.

so indirectly its murder.. ?

My middle sister went into a dark storage area & stepped into an open bucket of oil paint.

The more we tried 2 clean things
the messier it got. Parents
came home 2 disaster
4205 2018-11-15 16:56:22 Democrats are free to stop using oil ANYTIME!
4206 2018-11-15 16:56:18 Boiled pancakes and engine oil.
4207 2018-11-15 16:56:17 I did.  Just got an oil change and everything swapped last week.  With my commute, car care is more important than self care.
4208 2018-11-15 16:56:06 Oil pumping in systems and reprocessing across the statistical range of stocks and construction of accreditation Operating through operating systems and management Definition and presentation of special systems in the channel for the commitment of aspects of  wall and penetration
4209 2018-11-15 16:55:50 Start by defending why they report our oil will get us through Brexit but for an independent Scotland it’s worthless?
What successful small country infrastructure will we emulate & invest in innovation etc & exploit our greater resources, tech skills & inventiveness?
Visionless?
4210 2018-11-15 16:55:49 lmaoo yes when I make mine i mix sugar, vaseline & a tiny tiny drop of some type of oil. rub it on dry lips (works better with a toothbrush) wipe off with a washcloth & then put on chap stick.
4211 2018-11-15 16:55:42 If U have problem run to God don't run away from God for it's written in the book of James 5:14  is any sick among you? Let him call for the elders of the church and let them pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord
And the prayer of faith shall save the sick
4212 2018-11-15 16:55:41 I am super long oil...The only think that I just have too much and I will need to sell OTM calls every week....Let's talk tomorrow and see what levels are good to sell OTM calls for the following week..
4213 2018-11-15 16:55:39 Also i want to do a hot oil treatment todaj
4214 2018-11-15 16:55:32 Loooooooool Muslim market incoming oil moneys
4215 2018-11-15 16:55:24 I am suspicious of Exxon Mobile. It was proven that big oil KNEW about the effect of climate change and their own contribution since the early and mid 80s at least .. and they lobbied HARD not to get change. And till today they never took responsibility for this!
4216 2018-11-15 16:55:18 What year is that? 72 ish by the frame / oil tank
4217 2018-11-15 16:55:04 I just left Nigeria few days ago, I have 2 companies over there.I spend at least 4 weeks per trip. I just told you the price of crude oil crashed or you not listening?If the USA cannot make money through oil you think they won’t make it through dollars?This things are controlled
4218 2018-11-15 16:54:57 What about refineries on the prairies and ship product seasonally thru Churchill? Hopefully sheer would legislate pipelines thru to the coast but we need backup plans, multiple choices and stop buying middle eastern oil.
4219 2018-11-15 16:54:43 I got enough oil to make 3 cakes 
4220 2018-11-15 16:54:43 I just wanna clean my car & change my oil but it’s keep fucking raining
4221 2018-11-15 16:54:42 Rain & college is like water & oil.. Shit don’t mix at all 
4222 2018-11-15 16:54:37 You are wrong.. Oil price crashed in 2014 during Jonathan's era that was when the biggest buyer(USA) stopped buying.. You can google it.. He was able to salvage the economy with effort of Okonjo Iweala
4223 2018-11-15 16:54:35 Oil won’t be running out. The Middle East is sitting on an ocean of oil. The world will stop depending on oil long before it “runs out”
4224 2018-11-15 16:54:07 80$ oil change. Quality Over Quantity.
4225 2018-11-15 16:53:58 Damn right!
I only drive in roads I’ve built myself... and use gas for which not one cent of US taxpayer money has made available through war (I have an oil well in my backyard and refine it into gas in my kitchen)
4226 2018-11-15 16:53:56 Barely, but I also have an Herbal Oil that I switch it out w/. I always just apply a thin layer to my scalp and ends
4227 2018-11-15 16:53:50 That why there still isn't a motorway from the oil capital of Britain to Edinburgh?
4228 2018-11-15 16:53:50 Its allergy of cold air/AC on nose on wake up...

Do not breath by nose in morning 
Cover nose on wake up time 

Also smoke of breakfast cooking/oil

4229 2018-11-15 16:53:48 Oil turns back down as inventories rise
4230 2018-11-15 16:53:47 Franzen's personality is "unsmiling oil portrait of Jonathan Franzen"
4231 2018-11-15 16:53:42 How’s my day off progressing? Well I’ve got oil in my hair and a cinnamon and honey scrub all over my face and I’m sitting half naked on the couch with the cat so it’s pretty good
4232 2018-11-15 16:53:33 Oil gains and NQ offset stopping out NG. Will try long NG again if it sets up 60min parabolic line. Zero care
4233 2018-11-15 16:53:25 I’m not arguing with you. We don’t make what that picture was ...we make oil down. You could have what ever opinions you want. I could care less. Y’all dish nasty and y’all mad cause we don’t like it? Okay 
4234 2018-11-15 16:53:24 Do you know what oil reserves are? Do you know what the ANC did with our oil reserves? Do you know that DA would protect us from that?
4235 2018-11-15 16:53:12 ดีใจมากค่าพี่ฟ่าง รักน้าาาาา
4236 2018-11-15 16:53:11 HAHAHAHAHA gym na tayo. Naglaro kami kanina ping pong, lumabas lahat ng oil ng samgyup eh. HAHA
4237 2018-11-15 16:53:11 The argan oil ecostyler is the only one that can actually lay my hair down
4238 2018-11-15 16:52:53 I could legit make a meal out of some fresh Italian or semolina bread, some extra virgin olive oil (Spanish or Italian), some aged balsamic, some choice herbs (oregano and basil) and cheese.
4239 2018-11-15 16:52:49 It's not a time to get weak-kneed or full of fear. This day and age calls for women who have lamps full of oil, prepared and ready . . .  ready to serve, pray and reach the lost and hurting.

Matthew 25:1-14
4240 2018-11-15 16:52:47 Closing prices: #Ftse100 0.06% #DAX -0.52% #CAC -0.70% #Estoxx50 -0.48% #GBPUSD 1.2756 #EURGBP 0.8873 #GILTBUND 101.3 #Gold 0.26% #Oil 1.69%
4241 2018-11-15 16:52:45 I really wish the Ralphs by my house would stop frying their tortilla chips in the same oil as their chicken. I shouldnt be getting hints of fried chicken with my guacamole and chips.
4242 2018-11-15 16:52:41 soak scallops in moonshine, blackberry or peach is my go to, for an hour
drizzle em in olive oil and sprinkle seasoned salt
throw em on the smoker at 225 for 25-30 minutes
enjoy
4243 2018-11-15 16:52:28 My current conversation with my cats is not to drink the oil that’s on the stove. 
4244 2018-11-15 16:52:25 Meanwhile cooling oil left group
4245 2018-11-15 16:52:24 They dry your oil production up, I used noxema to clean my face when I had acne it didn't dry out my face, just don't use a wash cloth on your face use your hands, they irritate the skin, Vaseline works best on my lips
4246 2018-11-15 16:52:22 How many playoff games have the Canucks LOST since 1970?
The Oil will win their 6th Cup before the Canucks get their 1st. 
#markmyword
4247 2018-11-15 16:52:16 OKAY got my prescription and I'm getting my tires rotated!! Next is oil change and then I can go home
4248 2018-11-15 16:52:14 555555555
4249 2018-11-15 16:52:13 Indeed - that's the whole pt.  When US mvd oil fr commodity to "ccy bkg" in '73, it required mvg oil fr ~$2 to $11 nearly overnight, & to $40 by end of the decade.  I'd guess doing so again would prob require $500-1000 oil this time.  Econ would collapse, billions would starve
4250 2018-11-15 16:52:11 I’ve been liking jojoba oil for a moisturizer lately! :)
4251 2018-11-15 16:51:56 While all of AB did suffer with the oil crash recession, #yyc has been particularly hard hit with large layoffs that occured in head offices, especially in the middle to high income groups.  Those people and businesses used to pay a lot of property taxes.
4252 2018-11-15 16:51:49 Oil change & new tire 
4253 2018-11-15 16:51:46 What is going to make us money is that apparently the Saudis are furious that they were conned by Trump into crashing the market and then he gives waivers to everyone for Iranian oil. Now they are reducing exports to the US and will make OPEC cut production.
4254 2018-11-15 16:51:33 The interest shown in the inline oil sensor displayed at the Machinery Lubrication show in Houston means just one thing- Industry is ready for oil analysis to be part of IIoT. Are you? Let's discuss.
4255 2018-11-15 16:51:29 Coconut oil isn’t good for the face :’(
4256 2018-11-15 16:51:27 No problem! Hope the oil starts helping you out!
4257 2018-11-15 16:51:21 I' curious if you know the amount of subsidies given to the oil and gas industry each year?
4258 2018-11-15 16:51:16 What the heck does he reinvest in? He’s a treasure hunter lol has he bought out a treasure hunting company, started up a couple mining companies, and slowly made his way into the oil industry?
4259 2018-11-15 16:51:07 Gun Oil is supreme. I need to stop playing and get me another travel container and just use that.
4260 2018-11-15 16:51:04 Ladies don't wait until January to get your oil changed. You needed that shit 2 months ago.
4261 2018-11-15 16:50:53 Can the MSM PLEASE stop giving snake oil salesman  #Farage a voice! 
4262 2018-11-15 16:50:43 จะเทกันจริงๆแล้วใช่มั้ย กูลบแอปนะ รังเกียจ !!! #AAACheat
4263 2018-11-15 16:50:38 But then the farmers no longer have any way to make money and would starve. Purchasing sustainable palm oil, and rallying to support the introduction of the carbon market, where forest not cut down can be traded in for credits would be beneficial.
4264 2018-11-15 16:50:27 Price per barrel of oil today at $66
- Oct 3 barrel high mark of the year at $84
- $84 is highest since free fall began in late 2014, bottoming out at $29 in early 2016, climbing steadily over 2nd half 2017 & 2018
So why has oil price fallen so rapidly in the last 1.5 month?
4265 2018-11-15 16:50:25 I bet the oil on the dipstick.  Looks like Chocolate Milk...
4266 2018-11-15 16:50:05 I guess he knows indictments are imminent.
Mueller might pick up Traitor Tot Don Jr soon
Trump is calling his rabid base to the barricades!
Crazy times ahead in USA & UK, all self inflicted by angry voters who were conned by snake oil politicians.
4267 2018-11-15 16:50:03 —nor lower oil prices
4268 2018-11-15 16:49:58 As a female I really don’t know why it’s so hard for us to get an oil change.
4269 2018-11-15 16:49:57 This calls for celebration. Mahindra is one such Indian company which has invested its soul into electric mobility. It will reap its dividend sooner than later. Hoping, it is also paying attention towards material like lithium cobalt sourcing. It shouldn't become next oil
4270 2018-11-15 16:49:46 Boleh suggest tak cleansing oil for oily and acne prone skin? #TanyaTK @twt_kecantikann @kanda_aziz @chizubunny
4271 2018-11-15 16:49:37 Am i the only one that keeps their car maintenance up to date? My best friend hasn’t had her oil change in over a year lmao
4272 2018-11-15 16:49:35 You mean the country with the world's largest proven reserves of crude oil? That Venezuela?
4273 2018-11-15 16:49:30 Makes me want to run out a buy some oil
4274 2018-11-15 16:49:29 I came in for an oil change not for you to fuck up my car! 
4275 2018-11-15 16:49:14 Well let's see....oil is teetering on bear territory, apple is in bear territory, valuations are stretched, the S&P saw a 10% Sept. correction which may be more than a pull back. The DOW will be hit harder by tariffs. The value of the dollar continues to rise. Who's going to buy?
4276 2018-11-15 16:49:11 If oil was drilled from the north Nigeria would have long been restructured
4277 2018-11-15 16:49:08 Wat? He is talking about the market price of Alberta oil it has nothing to do with the cost.
4278 2018-11-15 16:49:05  this wasn’t meant for nobody, i was bored at work and was doing it for the retweets..... even tho i did have to change that bitch oil onetime lmao
4279 2018-11-15 16:49:04 馬油を英訳すると…うーむ(中の人の英語力の限界)
4280 2018-11-15 16:49:01 40 ans qu'on vous dit que le gaz oil c'est de la merde! Alors les cigales qui viennent pleurer aujourd'hui ne vont pas me sortir une larme. C'est comme les paysans qui pleurent contre la sécheresse alors qu'ils en sont les premiers responsables!
4281 2018-11-15 16:48:58 So in 1945 when the Japanese navy doesn’t have enough oil to leave port, doesn’t have enough surviving airmen to man its planes and its last intact field army is being rolled over by the soviets they still had a chance to win the war?

4284 2018-11-15 16:48:35 Oil Price RSI Holds in Oversold Territory Even as UAE Vows to Cut Output | #Forex
4285 2018-11-15 16:48:34 now you are just lying. Tesla makes excellent cars & owners love them and have repeatedly said they will drive nothing else. Elon has a mission & he is true to that mission. Subsidies are for ALL EV makers not just Tesla & subsidies for oil and gas DWARF any EV subsidy out there!
4286 2018-11-15 16:48:27 Arab Oil aren’t a big club.
4287 2018-11-15 16:48:25 @Flipkart @HUL_News i ordered 400ml indulekha bringha oil thru flipkart during big billion day offer. The product delivered by flipkart is duplicate and quality of delivered product is worst. After using delivered product i am facing hair fall problem again.
4288 2018-11-15 16:48:15 @JustinTrudeau 
Defence contracts with Saudi
East Coast Saudi oil imports while  sits on massive supply

Do the right thing please
4289 2018-11-15 16:48:15 “When did Palestinians start selling olive oil? About 3,000 years ago. The Romans took it over to their ports, but it was in Palestine where olive groves grew indigenously.” @AtifChoudhury @Zaytoun_CIC #MeaningConf

4291 2018-11-15 16:48:08 Yes all the major oil areas of Scotland hate the snp.

4293 2018-11-15 16:48:00 Where would be the crude oil moving after the drastic plunge to 55? I think correction will pull it back to 60
4294 2018-11-15 16:47:52 Yes. Oil price is included.
4295 2018-11-15 16:47:50 Beard oil
4296 2018-11-15 16:47:47 To be fair cbd oil is legal which is the medicinal property of marijuana and products like charlottes web which seems to be the best medicine for seizures cannabis wise is allowed in the UK now. Still, needs to be legalised recreationally
4297 2018-11-15 16:47:40 People pray for cake... but when the almighty gives them eggs, oil, butter, batter, a pan & an oven they get frustrated and leave the kitchen.
4298 2018-11-15 16:47:39 Nigeria is not a producing nation, without oil we are finished. That’s one of the main reason  patriotic Jonathan stepped down, May God bless him for that. Most people don’t know this. The focast was Nigeria was plunging into financial recession 2017
4299 2018-11-15 16:47:24 Ternyata tea tree oil sepanas ini kalo kena jerawat hiyahhhh
4300 2018-11-15 16:47:21 The scope to take our minds off this clear reality is already failed. We clearly see the helicopter belonging to the @PoliceNG... Tell us something else... Did it come to drop oil?
4301 2018-11-15 16:47:21 1 box of yellow cake mix
2 small boxes of instant vanilla pudding
1/2 cup of veggie oil
1 1/4 cups of water
4 eggs
1 cup Heath toffee pieces (right on the chocolate chip aisle)
4302 2018-11-15 16:47:14 y’all i went to go get my oil changed this morning and when i went up to pay i noticed i didn’t have my wallet first person that came to mind was cels and she came through guys 
4303 2018-11-15 16:47:03 Palm oil probably doesn't do us a lot of good either! Trouble is, it appears to be in almost everything we eat!
4304 2018-11-15 16:46:54 I don't know what jogged my memory, but I must remember to pop into #JohnLewis and pick up a paddling pool and some olive oil.
4305 2018-11-15 16:46:47 They don’t, they’re just a statement now to make you sit up and notice them.  In fact the only one that beats any relevance is the Iceland one as it outlines their own policy on palm oil
4306 2018-11-15 16:46:05 I did a bit of cross-conversion and found out that between their last update and this, Botswana are increasing petrol price by ~N10. In one month. Even though they've not fully deregulated, they're being realistic about fuel prices based on crude oil price movement.
4307 2018-11-15 16:45:54 That is because they have no oil to refine into gasoline. 

Oh, wait..........
4308 2018-11-15 16:45:51 Non SERVIAM! SERVIAM not I! The water was very cold and damp and very damp and cold...the oil sheet smell like my Mother Gertrude O THY INCESTUOUS SHEETS!
4309 2018-11-15 16:45:43 Feeling bad know, went to the kitchen to make some potatoes, but cut them way too thin and they melted with the oil
4310 2018-11-15 16:45:40 Olive oil  #ded
4311 2018-11-15 16:45:40 Why the FUCK are oil changes so god damn expensive
4312 2018-11-15 16:45:38 ผ่านไปสักทีเถอะ
4313 2018-11-15 16:45:37 Only reason I’m getting this oil change today is because I’m ready for this road trip

4315 2018-11-15 16:45:26 And Iraq that was all about oil not weapons of mass destruction
4316 2018-11-15 16:45:23 Other than being a neat freak with your hands, I'd say try exfoliating creams that aren't too rough. My skin is hella prone to break outs cuz I have enough oil on my skin to start a car. So I just use exfoliating wipes whenever I need them and pat dry my skin.
4317 2018-11-15 16:45:20 feynman, 1918, forrester, 1918, fuller, 1895, had ideas about education. bucky's synergetics was most certainly not science, but inspired a heck of a lot of science. accdng to godel, even math does not exist in a vaccum. i don't need science to know oil executives lie and deny.
4318 2018-11-15 16:45:19 about to play a prank on Ashton involving oil. wonder how it'll go.
4319 2018-11-15 16:45:03 Congressperson refers to someone in the house specifically.  Replacing oil rigs will be done with solar, hydro and nukes, not burning trees.  You sound like you work for the company trying to sell this dumb gadget.
4320 2018-11-15 16:44:54 1.  Sauté ~pound of shucked mussels in pan with olive oil, minced garlic & crushed red pepper
2.  Add frozen cauliflower rice & ~cup of canned fire roasted crushed tomatos
3. Mix in & melt shredded pepper jack cheese
4. Eat
5. Smile a lot
4321 2018-11-15 16:44:24 Man that can't fry the oil first before putting stew.. (foreplay)
4322 2018-11-15 16:44:09 i need an oil change, anyone wanna do that for me?
4323 2018-11-15 16:44:03 The threat of snow here in the northeast reminds me of the time Oil Can Boyd, Willie McGee, Keith Hernandez and I mistook a snowman for a mountain of cocaine. Chaos ensued. Someone punched a bear. That snowman? Dusty Pedroia 1977. This is Peter Gammons. #MLB #FirstSnow #snowday
4324 2018-11-15 16:43:59 Seems like there's an oil spill around the DM gate, apply spike speed breaker.....
4325 2018-11-15 16:43:58 Guy.. to be fit, you dont need to starve yourself oo!! You can still eat your amala but have vegetable soup instead and pack it with meat and no oil!
4326 2018-11-15 16:43:58 We must go green.@Smaczni thread gives details of yet another lobby driven corrupt #Trump hack #BernardMcNamee who would set back #climatechange legislation by handing the reigns back to oil,coal, &nuclear industries. People want green jobs for another reason: they don’t kill you
4327 2018-11-15 16:43:51 Just made an appointment for my winter tires/oil change ONLINE. I love when I don’t have to deal with people. 
4328 2018-11-15 16:43:37 I need to get my oil changed today 
4329 2018-11-15 16:43:32 Let's burn the midnight oil.

4332 2018-11-15 16:43:21 And now Chamchas can drink oil
4333 2018-11-15 16:43:13 I hate going to get an oil change

4336 2018-11-15 16:42:54 My headlight went out yesterday and so Tyler was changing it and decided to check my oil and it turns out I had ZERO, I’m talking to the point where smoke was coming out of it..
4337 2018-11-15 16:42:54 Farage has just admitted on live TV that he _still_ hasn't read the draft agreement, so whatever he says about it is, as usual for him, ill-informed bluster and soundbites, with no offer of feasible alternatives. The man is a snake oil salesman, nothing more.
4338 2018-11-15 16:42:53 UMBC is in as much denial about this snow as oil barons are in denial about global warming and women’s rights
4339 2018-11-15 16:42:47 This is such an awesome idea. Doing the thing on Thursdays I mean. (Although getting an oil change and winter tires is pretty darn special too.) This could change my life. #GoodSlogansForProcrastinators
4340 2018-11-15 16:42:39 Unfortunately, it's almost better, if these Cabinet members are overtly corrupt. Their self-serving greed, alerts us to the damages they inflict upon the environment, our #publiclands #wildlife #wilderness while selling off Nat Monuments to Mining & Oil corps. We're Watching 
4341 2018-11-15 16:42:38 Oil gone 67. How? 
Play? =)
4342 2018-11-15 16:42:26 It was great not been able to use it much this year even though we live only a 10min walk we've been plagued with palm oil and jelly fish both poisonous to the dogs
4343 2018-11-15 16:42:21 Because nigeria was the top 3 highest producers of crude oil those years you taking about, it crashed. That’s the main reason not because of Buhari, forget sentiments. Greece suffered same they had to borrow to survive they couldn’t even pay workers
4344 2018-11-15 16:42:16 Jaaannn main to kesi my sath use nahi karti but you can use it with coconut oil

4348 2018-11-15 16:42:01 I HEARD OIL! INVADE!!!!!!!!! *DEPLOYS THE TROOPS*
4349 2018-11-15 16:42:01 Unless anyone who's advocating for "banning abortion" is also advocating to stop wars for money, drugs & oil & to put in #UniversalBasicIncome with regional cost of living supplements- they're not really "prolife" just Probirth !
4350 2018-11-15 16:41:59 not on your side that's for sure
4351 2018-11-15 16:41:58 Omg I just want to get a fucking oil change why does something always get in the way ahhhh
4352 2018-11-15 16:41:49 Haha asking to be rescued by Gove is like sending an oil tanker to an inferno instead of a fire engine!
4353 2018-11-15 16:41:47 Mehengai Aur Oil tax se ko gareeb Janta trasit hoo raha hai, Bhagawan hi janta hai. Baki sacchai kardwi hoti hai, magar yeh sach hai ..
4354 2018-11-15 16:41:41 Betul, kalau tukar kepada soyoil lagila banyak tanah kena hapus. Sebab crop/yield sawit adalah yg paling tinggi. 

Apa yang kita perlu buat ialah sokong sustainable palm oil.

4357 2018-11-15 16:41:29 I may be ill informed but this is cbd oil. Not tobacco or marijuana and she’s using it for anxiety. I don’t think it will cause any harm.
4358 2018-11-15 16:41:20 Thanks slot friend. You still haven't delivered that green oil you got from nyege 
4359 2018-11-15 16:41:17 About to douse my car in peppermint oil ... haVE FUN LIVING IN CANDY LAND SPIDERS
4360 2018-11-15 16:41:11 So, short oil?
4361 2018-11-15 16:41:10 Lamps was the one with the better players around him that made him look better than he was. Scholes was the heart of United and the oil in that engine. He was a truly unique player. 
Gerrard was practically a one man team at times. He did so much because he has to!
4362 2018-11-15 16:41:01 My mom finally quit because the menthol oil actually pooled in her lungs after years of smoking them, but I have no idea how often that happens, but I do know they're implying the regulars one are safer by targeting like this.
4363 2018-11-15 16:40:56 Geesch...imagine if some of that oil money be poured back into real climate change incentives!
4364 2018-11-15 16:40:54 わあ、ありがとです！！
4365 2018-11-15 16:40:49 Time for me to get an oil change
4366 2018-11-15 16:40:49 The senate is part of congress.  Yes wood has particles that are captured by filters.  Replacing fracking wells and oil rigs with forests doesn't sound like its going to do anything for air quality?  We should just keep fracking because burning wood isn't perfect, just better.
4367 2018-11-15 16:40:25 おつかれさまです…！
おやすみなさい！
4368 2018-11-15 16:40:17 Plumiting my ass! Our gas has stayed the same $2.97 since June no change in gas price but crude oil has dropped over 30%

4373 2018-11-15 16:40:02 The oil
4374 2018-11-15 16:39:59 Have you tried baking it? I usually get about a lb or so of Grass Fed Beef Liver from @WholeFoods (it's fairly cheap, like $5-6/lb), then I slice up two onions, drizzle in some @terradelyssa  Olive Oil (a tbsp or 2), and bake it in the oven, 375 for about 30 or so minutes #tasty
4375 2018-11-15 16:39:58 ICYMI: Pagkukumahog ng mga negosyante bago suspendihin ang oil tax, binanatan  #TomorrowsNewsTonight #DZRHNationwide @doe_ph
4376 2018-11-15 16:39:49 It's an old oil dispenser! That's why the funnel is so narrow, it's meant to hold oil or dressing :D
4377 2018-11-15 16:39:38 Good. You don’t know. But both you & Nick are gullible enough to think they’ll let the oil go through without any tarrifs or costs. Bit like you think our EU trade will travel freely through England. Only the properly gullible believe that.
4378 2018-11-15 16:39:29 When mights the Dems start holding the Oil and Natural Gas Industry accountable for ANYTHING? Asking for the planet.

4382 2018-11-15 16:39:22 I was away for three weeks & apparently now everyone is dripping cbd oil into their coffee in East London, I’m so behind the times
4383 2018-11-15 16:39:08 That one always makes me laugh.
A rock was a weapon of war at one time, so were pointy sticks, hot oil, bows and arrows, and pretty much anything else you can use to subdue someone.
4384 2018-11-15 16:39:04 Oil, up. Copper, up. Yen head faked, backing down. And all the big names starting to talk up there recent purchases as the RSI breakdown starts to reverse.  I smell a monster rally in the next few trading sessions!

4387 2018-11-15 16:38:50 How Trump-Modi orchestrated a crash in crude

1.Trump forced Saudi to pump up the supply ahead of Iran sanction

2. Saudi boosted oil supply to highest level

3. Modi called Trump & convinced him to Exempt India from Iran sanction

4. Trump Agreed

5. Oil glut

6. Price crashed
4388 2018-11-15 16:38:48 No credit due to Doug Ford.  He’s not in control of world oil prices. Please.
4389 2018-11-15 16:38:34 @TheRealPieComp @qvcuk  Have to ask again as had no reply, Do you use Palm Oil in your products!
4390 2018-11-15 16:38:30 OC Spray is nothing like pepper spray, mace. Whatever y’all wanna call the shit.  that shit is like oil & it sticksssss. Water don’t help. Nothing helps. Whyyyyyyyy me

4396 2018-11-15 16:38:05 The lower the price for a barrel of oil the more incentive for Dems to raise gas tax revenue.  Oregon's gas price is still $3.29
4397 2018-11-15 16:37:38 I’m getting my first oil change on my truck and I didn’t know how to pop the hood, pinche vergüenza 
4398 2018-11-15 16:37:36 Social security is not welfare and is a pay-in take-out system. Congress has robbed it making it insolvent.

Basic care is almost a pragmatic necessity but government has regulated and allowed monopolies making it expensive and wants to sell us the snake oil cure of universal HC.
4399 2018-11-15 16:37:16 Palm oil actually can’t be banned because it’s the most effective oil to use, we get the most from it from taking not a great deal, SUSTAINABLE use needs to be pushed but banning it is DUMB
4400 2018-11-15 16:37:12 Do you see this move as Ghadhban wanting to retain his influence as Oil Minister, or a genuine concern about the structure of INOC?
4401 2018-11-15 16:37:12 I use mine (mine is Jade tho) every night. I love it. I keep it in the fridge & use after applying my night oil. Refreshing too!

4409 2018-11-15 16:36:46 *flop* I just got an oil change too. I hate cars

4412 2018-11-15 16:36:29 But he continues to open public lands to oil and gas extraction after seeing the devastation of climate change. Talk about science denial.

4413 2018-11-15 16:36:26 I swear im at the Honda Dealership and these service advisors keep coming back to tell people bere bad news about their vehicles i swear its like im in an episode of Grey's mi a wait on my fuckery news although i only came for an oil change
4414 2018-11-15 16:36:25 I can definitely vouch for the mango & lime, that’s been a life saver for those itchy days. I got olive/coconut oil in my rotation.
4415 2018-11-15 16:36:24 Me, too... Some have this idea that Pelosi is in cahoots with Big Oil, proving that her detractors haven't bothered to look at her actual pro-regulation/anti-subsidies/anti-drilling voting record.
4416 2018-11-15 16:36:24 Ahhh your head has oil
4417 2018-11-15 16:36:18 Maybe… Just maybe we are chilled out this year because of heavy Chemtrail activities… Does anybody know what I’m talking about?… Nobody cares about the price of oil… As long as it is cheap at the gas pump…For those who have a moral compass… Time to do some soul searching!
4418 2018-11-15 16:36:10 Whale oil gave off the best light :)

4420 2018-11-15 16:36:10 I bet there's an essential oil for that ....
4421 2018-11-15 16:36:10 Memang smell mcm fish oil pun. 
4422 2018-11-15 16:36:04 Reducing oil imports is good for the economy. Producing more power within the UK is good for the economy. 

Not having properties flooded is good for the economy.

Preparing for Climate change is good for the economy.
4423 2018-11-15 16:35:54 The 70’s predicted Oil Wars. Today we’re predicting Water Wars. Tomorrow we predict Protein Wars.
4424 2018-11-15 16:35:53 Avacado oil is helping my eczema very nicely 
4425 2018-11-15 16:35:52 Maybe be the city has some leftover cooking oil from the Superbowl lampost manuever. 

You know, a little oil, 
less scraping sound!

No? Too soon? I’ll stop now.
4426 2018-11-15 16:35:51 Amnesia shouldn't have shown the sanity/oil in the inventory. Sanity level should be hidden completely & the oil should have been displayed on a meter on the lantern or by making it dim or something. It kind of breaks the horror atmosphere when you have to look at a menu imo

Where red oil dey? 
4430 2018-11-15 16:35:36 We need to change oil's color to green. Then 
Ocasio-Cortez will think it's part of the 100% green BS she's pushing and she'll be on our side.
4431 2018-11-15 16:35:26 Very misleading headline @MSNBC manif it is quiet because the counting machines are overheating. You enjoy throwing oil on a fire?
4432 2018-11-15 16:35:22 Ain't it amazing the influence a little palm oil usage in a cosmetics business, and a Portuguese familial connection in a wildlife NGO can make. 

That's why you don't let them in, fuckheads.
4433 2018-11-15 16:35:22 France sets out plan to end 'imported deforestation' - France set out plans on Wednesday to tackle deforestation around the world, saying it would look to curb imports of products such as palm oil, soy and beef that contribute to the destruction of forest areas.: …
4434 2018-11-15 16:35:21 Shut up ur mouth dia!!! Which rainy day did he fight for? It was only okonjo-nweala that said dey suld save, al d other governors said no that oil was booming. Don't follow blindly and argue without fact. Ask him ursef on his Twitter handle, he won't reply.
4435 2018-11-15 16:35:15 Not...a...fukn....clue.
Will it change the fact it’s not their oil? 
4436 2018-11-15 16:35:10 

That one na anointing Oil
4437 2018-11-15 16:34:42 Hope crude oil remains low for long. However we need to expediate use of alternative fuel.
4438 2018-11-15 16:34:28 Why ruin a good piece of meat with anything but some salt or something to bring out the good flavors. Steak sauce or ketchup. Why not put 10w oil on it then.
4439 2018-11-15 16:34:28 When persecution hits, Focus. Focus upon the LORD. 
Psalm 141:5-8   
"5 Let the righteous strike me; It shall be a kindness. And let him rebuke me; It shall be as excellent oil; Let my head not refuse it. For still my prayer is against the deeds of the wicked..."
4440 2018-11-15 16:34:24 Indeed as a reserve asset gold could back an oil/trade clearing system (as I have said for years) & the more real-time the clearing system, the less trust backing it needs. But gold is (literally) useless either as a reserve currency or unit of account.
4441 2018-11-15 16:34:03 Yes, @HeidOil certainly is childish...blissfully she blocked me when she first joined Twitter...couldn't keep up lolol...Still spouting utter rubbish on #LSE I see...clogging up the board wherever she goes....tut tut.  #UKOG
4442 2018-11-15 16:33:59 When will the Young Living essential oil packages start coming ?
4443 2018-11-15 16:33:56 If you just want to keep burning oil, have at it.  you deserve this world.
4444 2018-11-15 16:33:54 Once a month at a minimum, oil, lube and functions check.  Test fire (Train) as well if you got the ammo. Definitely test fire your everyday carry once a week or a minimum of once every two weeks. Firearms are like cars you cant let them sit you got to run them every so often.
4445 2018-11-15 16:33:47 Don't forget that there was a oil executives meeting in Delhi with PM
4446 2018-11-15 16:33:39 Can't happen: there is a greater supply of US 10 Year Notes than there is of either oil or copper  
4447 2018-11-15 16:33:31 Come in to change the oil. Come out having the air and fuel filters changed too. >.< Good grief.
4448 2018-11-15 16:33:28 One is used for oil related imports. That’s the concession INTELS(Tinubu’s company) PAID for.

Tinubu’s INTELS didn’t stop ‘Aba traders’ from using the other Eastern ports; PH, Calabar & Warri.

Depth, Insecurity, inefficiency & other considerations(centralisation) re the reasons
4449 2018-11-15 16:33:10 You’re good at just saying. Maybe you know, because Nick doesn’t, how much oil goes through Shetland?
4450 2018-11-15 16:33:02 @UnionParkHonda literally has the rudest service associates and that’s why even tho i live in wilmington i always go out my way to go to Martin Honda. im only here cus it’s snowing and im desperate for an oil change #neveragain 
4451 2018-11-15 16:32:33 Lol idc how rich I am I wouldn’t pay that much for a damn oil change . Ridiculous
4452 2018-11-15 16:32:29 *My liquids spill all over the TL* That was motor oil that came out of me you dirty people. eue
4453 2018-11-15 16:32:26 Neither. Feet first, slowly, into a wood chipper. Or boiling oil, if we need to keep it medieval.
4454 2018-11-15 16:32:25 Maritime boundaries say Scotland has claim of over 90 percent of the oil but go off.
4455 2018-11-15 16:32:15 I thought about you this morning I walked out of the oil change place and it was snowing 
4456 2018-11-15 16:32:09 & want some mafe, ima find that oil today
4457 2018-11-15 16:32:02 Does this come as a Surprise to anyone? This was the Start of Canada’s Energy Sector going downhill and a clear Indicator for PMJT’s action ( or lack of) on the Pipeline Issue. Foreign Money is keeping our Oil to go to Market and the Liberals are making sure of it.

4468 2018-11-15 16:31:24 Only 19% of the worlds palm oil is certified as sustainable. This amounts to 11.61 million tonnes! 
Which means 49.51 million tonnes is not sustainable! 
#Sustainability #palmoil
4469 2018-11-15 16:31:22 The "inner workings" are screaming and shouting at people? Am I reading this correctly? Has Donnie finally started to leak oil from his last working gasket?
4470 2018-11-15 16:31:19 Is the last couple of days of turmoil /fighting ( $BTC / $BCH ) a case of manipulation in the #Crypto space, similar to:

#Oil trying to control #Renewable
#Petrol trying to control #Electric
4471 2018-11-15 16:31:09 Add oil, I will keep my finger crossed and wish the team will get the 3 points.
4472 2018-11-15 16:31:09 yea but lots of stuff not moving... $HD $BA oil stks suck considering first day wti holding... by days end we see.  Not sure though they will close them on the lows
4473 2018-11-15 16:31:07 If you wanna try the natural route: rinse often with warm salt water and either brush with or swig organic coconut oil ~ both should calm the pain
4474 2018-11-15 16:31:06 I used to write my problems down but found it no longer has the same effect. So I did a much needed clean and bought some berry oil to make the house smell nice then had a nap. I feel I can actually 'breathe' now. I do feel better after that rest. My head actually quieted.
4475 2018-11-15 16:31:04 he sactioned ppl not a country - that's how you avoid getting whole country mad and not creating a spike in oil
4476 2018-11-15 16:30:54 the CO2 in "the ground" in oil ultimately came from the atmosphere as well, oil is just old biological material.  Ergo, same closed loop. The Earth's Biosphere.  Bottom line, burning wood to power a Tesla is not much different than burning any other hydrocarbon. Go solar instead.
4477 2018-11-15 16:30:54 It's a different sort of year... we will be seeing a lot of this!  Thinking about how to change the oil on my snow blower... heh...

4504 2018-11-15 16:28:22 Very awesome experience! Kuya Bhong did my oil changed and filter changed:) and diagnosed my heater problem:)
4505 2018-11-15 16:28:06 so the carbon you put out gets totally reabsorbed by the trees in nature.  Yes they absorb CO2 from oil, but that c02 didn't come from the atmosphere.  It came from the ground and we can't put it back.  We can grow more trees and undo that process, not oil
4506 2018-11-15 16:28:06 Beyond unacceptable & disgusting.....yet western Canada can’t get it’s oil to market ....where are the framing protestors now?   How does this “shit” impact the ecosystems?    Ugh!   Dump Trudeau in with this where he belongs.   This is totally outrageous

4519 2018-11-15 16:26:46 How Trump-Modi orchestrated a crash in crude

1.Trump forced Saudi to pump up the supply ahead of Iran sanction

2. Saudi boosted oil supply to highest level

3. Modi called Trump & convinced him to Exempt India from Iran sanction

4. Trump Agreed

5. Oil glut

6. Price crashed

4543 2018-11-15 16:25:02 Sorry I was making tea. It’s a process you need to do at a dealership or service center to properly adjust your vehicle for winter weather. I work for a car dealership. The oil, fluids and other stuff have to be totally swapped out. /1

4550 2018-11-15 16:24:17 Cant fill it too high is my point. People always put too much oil in and thats why you always get these big fires. If you do it right, you dont really get much overflow. Some due to boiling, but not like that.
4551 2018-11-15 16:24:12 WTI is price of oil in America. Canada could be getting that full price but because it costs so much to export, we are essentially selling our oil at a discount. That discount comes off the oil price Canadian companies get for the same product.
4552 2018-11-15 16:24:12 Now then, let's be reasonable and talk optimum oil temperatures before we go off and grab the pitchforks. Little balsa wood pitchforks.

4569 2018-11-15 16:21:43 N. American is a net consumer of oil. Canada is not getting full price for oil because we cannot get it out of the country. While it seems counter intuitive that increasing supply will increase price, the price increase refers to Canada getting full price for their oil.

4606 2018-11-15 16:18:56 One pro tip (if you don’t have time to let your bread get stale) is you can toss the cubes French bread with olive oil and the same spices and bake it for about 10 min at 400°F to make crispy bread croutons.

4618 2018-11-15 16:17:48 @suefew I always wondered what "moderate" fighters were in Syria and the Middle East. If I were to guess I would say that it was any of them that were prepared to do oil business with "the West".
4619 2018-11-15 16:17:48 If palm oil is continually driving into pristine land for its needs, how the fuck does that translate to " land efficient". Its a damage targeted at a core. Like a bomb strike on an ammo dump. 

Focus on reclaiming, renourishing, and reusing spoiled land or shut the fuck up.

4638 2018-11-15 16:15:29 Market cap is irrelevant. Look at Oil. Its market cap is many many times more than all the money in the world.

More volume is not needed for the price to increase. Market cap is effectively a rankings system in crypto and nothing more.
4639 2018-11-15 16:15:23 I seem to recall a time the entire Alberta debt was paid down, infrastructure spending went way up, sales tax eas completeky eliminated and the province was in a surplus position year after year. I thought that was largely due to the oil industry and greatly benefitted Albertans.

4642 2018-11-15 16:15:12 @waitrose why do you feel the need to use palm oil, the production of which destroys rain forests, in products such as Waitrose Love Life Seeded Tortilla Wraps 8 per pack?

4649 2018-11-15 16:14:45 If palm oil producers are effectively choosing vulnerable sites so that they are doing the equivalent of putting a bomb on a fault line, what the fuck does it matter if it uses less land?  Pristine forest matters, mangroves matter. 

There's lots of dead green sites.

4773 2018-11-15 16:04:15 So I didn't actually read this as peaches until I got to the comments and let me just say it is something to read about a feminist icon preaching about massage oil and not be surprised
4774 2018-11-15 16:04:11 Nah. Just try and avoid palm oil products. Very difficult but I reckon we’ve cut our consumption by more than half in the last year. I looked at the Responsible PO Protocol and it looked pretty flaky.
4775 2018-11-15 16:04:10 I’m seeing so many comments like “my hair gets oily if I don’t wash it”  well when ya wash ya damn hair you strip the oils out, so it has to start over. And it’s making more oil than usual. So you have to train your hair basically. It really don’t happen over night.
4776 2018-11-15 16:03:56 Ay the smell of efficacent oil >>> any perfume
4777 2018-11-15 16:03:37 Sorry to hear this bro. My company too downsized a lot in 2016. That wasn't actually a good year in this country.

But one of the reasons I praise this govt esp their efforts to take us away from mono-economy solely reliant on oil.

2016 was caused mainly by pipeline blow ups...

4870 2018-11-15 15:57:30 Nice to know that you don't care for other parts of the country and prefer your Saudi oil over Canadian oil. That you are using Saudi oil is why your gas is more expensive today. 

With your thinking, we should not care about your region because your contribution is small.

Попугай часто грызся постоянно щебетал, и не любил сидеть в руках, но я его почти уже приучила. Но потом он умер((((

А про крысу до сих пор больно вспоминать. Я её очень любила...
4872 2018-11-15 15:57:29 arrived at 9:15 for my 9:30 oil change appointment... STILL waiting here at 10:57am
4873 2018-11-15 15:57:28 OH but it does, you don't know "dirty" until you see China, they are number# 1 on the list of "dirty". We need to feed our families, therefore we must slaughter animals. I am huge on animal rights but there must be a BALANCE.  CANADA NEEDS OIL! DO WHAT WE MUST!

4876 2018-11-15 15:56:59 If England puts tariffs on Scottish oil, energy, food etc, that harms England massively more. As it does with tariffs on most imports from other countries too. No idea why Brexiteers think "tariffs" are great and free trade deals with the US are great.

4880 2018-11-15 15:56:40 If cutting back on oil production is anti-competition then why has it been OK for gas prices per L. to be the same across a whole city? Why don't we refine our own oil in our own country re: Energy East? Why are milk quotas OK? Helllloooo anybody out there except  blind Liberals?
4881 2018-11-15 15:56:30 Yeah - no taking credit for this price drop either buddy - it’s an oil glut causing it. I don’t know why you feel tbe need to tell us something Gas Buddy tells us every day. You are redundant. Now fix hospitals or go away.

4886 2018-11-15 15:55:32 Typical Alt-Left response. Never any credit.  Ford promised fuel cost would lower by 10 cents.  He met his promise and then some regardless of global economics and Oil prices.  He came through or he is psychic...

4916 2018-11-15 15:53:10 Indeed they might. They may also have the view that there are less damaging and more sustainable ways for their forests to be used than producing palm oil at a pittance for the benefit of multiocorpiratiibd who contribute nothing to their economy?

4925 2018-11-15 15:52:27 Anyone else concerned that with Alberta basically giving their oil away for free, projected royalties are likely to be a fraction of projected. Highlights the high risk strategy of spending money before its earned.

4929 2018-11-15 15:51:43 As far as this Brexit deal goes... It looks to me like the Tories are intending to cut Northern Ireland free (eventually). They don’t care about Northern Ireland. As long as they have Scotland and our oil, that’s all that matters. Ireland can unify.

A shared responsibility is a key pillar of the RSPO Theory of Change, to continue driving momentum forward all  RSPO members must now share the responsibility for making sustainable palm oil the norm,
4957 2018-11-15 15:48:55 Probably due to an oil re-closer switch. When something falls across a power line, the switch typically cycles three times in an effort to burn through the object. After the third attempt, it’s lights out if the object remains. That’s how it works in North America anyway.
4958 2018-11-15 15:48:55 What are they doing with the funds? Well, let me shock you first. Despite cleaning up ghost workers from the federal civil service,all the money generated from oil last year wasn't enough to pay salaries & pension. Stew with that a bit.
In 2 budgets, N1.7t spent on infrastructure
4959 2018-11-15 15:48:53 If they can build environmentally unsound oil pipelines, why can’t they build a countrywide web of water distribution pipelines? We have the science to do this. They would help to put out the fires from ruptured oil pipelines. $$$$$$? Look at the cost of not doing it.

4961 2018-11-15 15:48:51 The cost to clean up Alberta’s oil & gas sites is $260 billion. There were 14.1 million private households in Canada in 2016. The clean up will cost every Canadian household $18,439.72. If just Albertans are liable, they'll pay $157,182.42 per household. WAKE UP! #cdnpoli #abpoli

4998 2018-11-15 15:45:36 You know you’re in a different stage of life when friends visit & you offer fish oil & vitaminD supplements (no that’s not a euphemism)....and they ACCEPT.

5003 2018-11-15 15:45:22 I would not consider a tax break a subsidy. As mentioned, if government disappeared, oil, gas and coal would still be produced. Solar and wind would not.
5004 2018-11-15 15:45:18 just put crayons in Bee's oil. now we wait.

Never had a car service that went as easily as this. It was cheaper than any other place I've gone, and the people were nice. Good stuff!
5026 2018-11-15 15:43:44 #ethanol plants receive ZERO subsidies. There used to be a blender credit that went to the oil refineries that were blending ethanol. I'm hoping the good people from the @iowafuel will chime in here.
5027 2018-11-15 15:43:38 It was an oil fire and they put water on it
5028 2018-11-15 15:43:29 Why did they not impose sanctions on the sale of weapons to Saudi Arabia and the purchase of oil from it?

5060 2018-11-15 15:39:50 @RachelNotley re oil production cut, yes markets are not functioning properly. Look how Canadian gas prices are disconnected from oil (thank the integrated companies for abusing us to fill in other holes of their business).
5061 2018-11-15 15:39:49 A thorough and well researched article, thank you.

Since you do deep dives into Byzantine regulation, would like to read how much $ they save via the convoluted regs on Oil which technically aren’t rebates. Eg how much they save drilling on land they don’t pay to lease, etc
5062 2018-11-15 15:39:46 @armstrongcbc. Peter. Are American billionaires funding all the protests against Alberta oil? Landlocking us out of the market?

5067 2018-11-15 15:39:37 Yesterday I overheard a supposedly educated investor in oil patch use that line. We're fighting both ends millenials and boomers. The line is "I don't want to talk about BTC I don't like what it does to the environment". Like new NPC line. Close conversation don't engage. Rubbish
5068 2018-11-15 15:39:33 I like coconut oil for like, a once a week deep condition, but it could be a little much for her hair, if it is on the finer side- avocado, sunflower, jojoba, grapeseed all work well. It's really just trying a bunch of different ones!

5091 2018-11-15 15:38:00 Fascinating to see that the measure of ensuing publicity exactly mirrors oil spills-not in proportion to the destruction caused, and politically motivated.
5092 2018-11-15 15:38:00 Not for me. If I want to eat less, I use butter to bake/roast my vegetables. If I need to eat more, I use olive oil. The more saturated fat used, the quicker you feel full.

I do eat a lot of vegetables, but I use fats to controll how much I eat. Always works.

5173 2018-11-15 15:31:57 I know...This is totally crazy...For 15.75 the co. should just leave the oil underground.
5174 2018-11-15 15:31:51 Oh I see. Yeah, on itself it probably has more salt than ideal. 

Try this if you like: Olives with Brie Cheese (curated in high fat goat milk), french bread and olive oil. None of it is healthy by itself but the combination makes for a very balanced, delicious health meal.
5175 2018-11-15 15:31:50 Avocado oil was my favorite to use, but I haven’t been back to buy any so I’ve been using coconut oil. Jojoba oil works well for me too! (I also have really dry skin though )

5181 2018-11-15 15:31:15 Do your research. In the same piece organizers state that the octopus is a reference to the Standard Oil octopus from 1900s, symbolizing monopolies. Rockefellers weren't Jewish and it wasn't until 1930s Nazis started using the octopus imagery to depict Jewish conspiracy.
5182 2018-11-15 15:31:11 The moment Trump negotiated a deal to defend the Saudi Royal family after the murder the price of a barrel of oil began dropping, as did gas prices. Coincidence? Don't think so.  Trump is a really good negotiator

5221 2018-11-15 15:28:35 Plus, they use the fact that they send doctors abroad for influence. They don’t have money to throw around like China & they can’t sell weapons like the U.S. so they use this instead. For example, with Chavez, Cuba sends doctors and Chavez would give them free oil.

5278 2018-11-15 15:24:11 Sense and 45 are like water and oil.
5279 2018-11-15 15:24:11 Honest question as I am a lover of olive oil.
How do you not burn the oil if you are frying chicken?  The flash point is too low for olive oil I have always found.
5280 2018-11-15 15:24:10 The land of Oil that made Ikwere boys lazy
5281 2018-11-15 15:24:09 One of my mom’s favorite stories is when she got a super early 7 am oil change appointment, and the waiting room TV was just blasting Cinemax soft core. You just need a Toyota.
5282 2018-11-15 15:24:09 It’s embarrassing you don’t even care to be factual. Universities will study how a “snake oil con artist” became POTUS.  It will be called ,”The Psychology of Lying Trumpisim” ....
5283 2018-11-15 15:24:04 @Gastropodcast Oh, in a pinch, the 39¢ mac n cheese can be made with a bit of vegetable oil and water when one is out of dairy products. #voiceofexperience
5284 2018-11-15 15:23:47 Thanks a lot Saudi Arabia; Americans were just getting used to prices that don't make us choose between medicine and gas. If Saudis cut output, it will put more Iranian oil on the black market.
5285 2018-11-15 15:23:43 No one since they stopped using gas and oil lights and moved to electricity!
5286 2018-11-15 15:23:32 ขอให้พรุ่งนี้เป็นวันที่ดี

5288 2018-11-15 15:23:20 Marie Harf one thing over the years America should look back at . Democrats they tell people in America do as We say not as We do .You people think more about other Countries then your own because of Stocks.So does other people! The only reason why stocks are up now OIL! Why?
5289 2018-11-15 15:23:18 I would love to try B!  I have been vaping your CBD oil and it works like a charm
5290 2018-11-15 15:23:16 Your books are sustained by the owner of a state  literally, you'll arent self sustainable. Its a win win for both. He can launder his black money & oil wealth & youll stay afloat as a club. Its artificial, inorganic + in bed with FIFA. Hence the issue- less fan support globally
5291 2018-11-15 15:23:14 America has; invaded multiple nations to steal oil, interfered in elections, financed revolutions, supported oppressive regimes, murdered civilians & assassinated heads of state! Who will sanction America? #SaudiArabia #Turkey #Iran #Iraq #Afghanistan #Pakistan #Africa #Venezuela
5292 2018-11-15 15:23:00 اول شي الله يرحمه ويدخله في واسع مغفرته، لكن ان تطالب أن يكون هناك شارع رئيسي في وطن خانه بقلمه فأنت اسمحلي زودتها وزودتها جدا..... نأسف على مقتله بهكذا جريمة بشعه، ولكن لانبرر الخيانه وشكرا
5293 2018-11-15 15:22:58 From inside.  Nice not being homeless this year...  and being able to afford heating oil and food 

Tone deaf, much?
5294 2018-11-15 15:22:57 I think that's when two liquids don't easily combine and you have a clear separated layer of a different fluid on top, like how olive oil just floats on water in a pot
5295 2018-11-15 15:22:48 You women want us to get ya oil change that’s $60. While y’all go on Wednesday and it’s $20. Doesn’t make sense lol

GOLD 1H moves higher, volatility begins to unwind, kick is higher. 
OIL 1H indicators now shift bullish. Dare I say WHALES pushed price action up first, indicators follow. UWT ?
5298 2018-11-15 15:22:24 They pity our outdated electoral college. They pity how little vacation Americans have. They pity how many obese people we have and the low quality of our food. They pity how weak our public schools are. They pity our dependence on cars & oil.
5299 2018-11-15 15:22:23 I have a few questions about CBD oil, vaping in particular...is there any research that shows it harmful to your lungs?
5300 2018-11-15 15:22:17 Bros!
Atiku, Obasonjo, IBB, Buhari, Gowon, Dangote (via contracts, tax waivers business etc) Otedola & Alakija (crude oil), Tinubu etc all became RICH via Nigeria Resources or & with govt portfolios. 
The Capital inflow into our nations & those generated via trade makes us RICH
5301 2018-11-15 15:22:13 Remain cautious on crude oil here, but think the consolidation process has begun as seasonal weakness comes to an end. USD, Gold, and Yen all getting a bid today while the market are still in  the red. Good to see gold and the yen join the USD in the safe haven bid.

5304 2018-11-15 15:22:03 Such tragedy in California.Lost of lives and once God given Glory. Seems I remember from History a corrupt Roman Empire was Burned to the ground. Seems I also remember an Iraq Leader setting all the oil wells on fire. What makes people think that this isn't a tactic today.
5305 2018-11-15 15:21:48 @MontyBojangles I love you but please stop using palm oil #SavetheOrangutan
5306 2018-11-15 15:21:46 So in case I ever need vocal chords first aid, does olive oil actually work?
5307 2018-11-15 15:21:37 @naomirwolf @YouTube its like banking system,GMO,Oil,Pharmaceutical same sh.t
5308 2018-11-15 15:21:28 I now understand..... the people who 'can't sign their name right the first time - they're the ones with red Xs in their Twitter names. The same ones who can't spell.

5315 2018-11-15 15:20:38 England needs to hug Scotland's oil very, very close cos it knows without it it's financially fucked. Now if NI had the same oil reserves.....
5316 2018-11-15 15:20:30 Man United will have to inject the Oil Money to spur success once again. Saudi takeover is on the cards. It is just a matter of time. #MUFC
5317 2018-11-15 15:20:27 There's a funny idea emerging from a large oil and gas conference this week;
'Data is the new oil' they say.
Funnily, the more data people have, the less oil they want.

5320 2018-11-15 15:20:20 Minyak kelapa? Castor oil?
5321 2018-11-15 15:20:18 Lots. Soy sauce, sesame oil, rice vinegar, sugar, garlic, gochujang, green onion, red pepper flake, and ginger.
5322 2018-11-15 15:20:08 What do you call a black man working on an oil rig?

A rigger.
5323 2018-11-15 15:19:59 It’s cold. Start sealing in your face moisturizer with a light oil. You’re welcome.

5328 2018-11-15 15:19:36 Well I do love the smell of china oil but I only take cough medicine when I really need it. Always looking forward to it. So yeah, I was serious. 
Even now I put a bowl of water in my room with a few drops of china oil in it. It kinda always smells like that in my room.
5329 2018-11-15 15:19:36 Nigeria made $26bn in crude oil revenue in the first 7 months of 2018. Just for reference, the country made $34bn in the year 2017. We take out loans from the world bank and accept loans from China YET nothing to show for it. Politicians are lining their pockets while people die!
5330 2018-11-15 15:19:33 Look, You Can Do As You Wish. You Replied To Me. *I* Think Soda Is A Useless Waste Of Money. Period. BTW: "FriedChicken", Made At Home With Olive Oil, Is Good... FastFood, Just Stinks Up Bathrooms
5331 2018-11-15 15:19:27 I'm thinking perhaps the straw lobby isn't quite as well established as Big Oil or the NRA but truuuuuu
5332 2018-11-15 15:19:22 Remember when he was caught on mike (credulously, gleefully) saying he thought trump would work with them?
That should have been the beginning of the end.
5333 2018-11-15 15:19:20 I remember very well how ko almost killed us by pouring water into flaming oil LMAOOO

5335 2018-11-15 15:19:14 More popcorn? But you'd need someone to supply the oil.
5336 2018-11-15 15:19:07 The rantings of a guilty lunatic way over his head. Why are YOU protecting Putin? What do you have to hide? Your oil debt? If there’s nothing thing there, let the investigation show it!
5337 2018-11-15 15:19:07 That’s because The Antarctic still has oil
5338 2018-11-15 15:19:02 Dropped off the car for tire and oil change and decided to walk back home 30 mins...this cold is real 
5339 2018-11-15 15:19:02 Kathy, we are happy you enjoyed this wonderful information! We hope you get the chance to try out that Worry Free! It is an incredible oil!
5340 2018-11-15 15:19:01 The same poor people probably are struggling for oil beside those ones in the cobalt mine. DWO was just an example within a lot. Never seen an ICE virt. worried for the same people in 1 century...surely not trying something new is a choice. Stay peacefully ICE.
5341 2018-11-15 15:18:58 Exactly... same as those not blaming their governor for unpaid salary but keep blaming buhari for it.

5346 2018-11-15 15:18:41 Its usually those Saudi Arabians who have so much of that oil money that they don’t know what to do with it.
5347 2018-11-15 15:18:39 Lev7:10  And every meat offering, mingled with oil, and dry, shall all the sons of Aaron have, one as much as another.  #BibleVerse
5348 2018-11-15 15:18:36 Also true, and some money is, but as long as oil is profitable it will always come first for these companies. Even at the expense of the environment and humanity.
5349 2018-11-15 15:18:20 「即死」だと思います。
5350 2018-11-15 15:18:16 #economy Import prices rose 0.5% in October, following a 0.2% advance in September. Crude oil prices rose 2.6%. Import prices are up 3.5% y/y. The report will not change Fed policy.
5351 2018-11-15 15:17:54 Kind of lol. So I blend onions, ginger, garlic, scotch bonnet (A LOT), long tail chillies, a bit of soy sauce, thyme, a dash of curry, Maggi cubes/stock powder. Blend with a bit of olive oil and small water.
5352 2018-11-15 15:17:50 Woke up with no oil, thanks Cogans I’m fucking FREEZING

5355 2018-11-15 15:17:24 Oil output cut so the price can go up..... that's what master Putin wants!
5356 2018-11-15 15:17:18 Also in terms of ransom, do well to join hands with the parents of these girls and collaborate in making sure their release is successful. Rather than calling on the President or politicizing the kidnap issue....
5357 2018-11-15 15:17:08 Who’s it costing? I can’t say it enough... the price of gas and diesel remains the same as when oil was $100/bbl. Someone is raking in a shit load of cash.
5358 2018-11-15 15:17:06 Maybe

5362 2018-11-15 15:16:52 $70 per bbl is a fair market price. Keeps production and service companies in business and the consumer still willing and able to buy the products. Canadian oil is trading at $15 a bbl right now after reaching a high of $60 right before the dispute between Trump and Trudeau

5365 2018-11-15 15:16:49 Every time I get my oil changed I feel like I'm in a doctor's office waiting on  a lecture.
5366 2018-11-15 15:16:47 ‘Cause it’s ethical oil ....
5367 2018-11-15 15:16:34 Currently, tweets about Clonmel Oil Chase are 26% positive, 74% neutral, and 0% negative.
5368 2018-11-15 15:16:26 True, but at the rate we are extracting oil currently, we will run out within 50 years. As for other things, like fossil fuels, I don’t think pressure should be put on halting their extraction, I think more money and research should be put into finding sustainable means to do so
5369 2018-11-15 15:16:21 I thought he entered the country disguised as an oil slick.
5370 2018-11-15 15:16:15 Well been in and out of the ES today, currently short... Long oil, short natty gas.. alot reaction to speculation and news...
5371 2018-11-15 15:16:10 How can we have 80% of the oil demand when OPEC has a monopoly on oil? This makes no sense. Also, if it could pissibly be true, oil is a finite resource. Why would we use up ours when we could use theirs first. #badnationalsecurity
5372 2018-11-15 15:16:04 You don't see voter counting problems in #Venezuela. The #UnitedStates is trying to disrupt their #Government.  That proves they only want the oil.  #greedy on #USA part, to tear a government apart for money.  Lift the #sanctions so they can get the commodities they need

5375 2018-11-15 15:15:43 Ameen
5376 2018-11-15 15:15:34 The only way how the oil price is going to come down is when the demand for oil go down. 
I've designed an engine which uses a quarter of the fuel of a normal motor.  I tried to get investors for my project. 

They are not interested. 

Why

It uses to little fuel.
5377 2018-11-15 15:15:34 Just cut into chunks, drizzle with olive oil, handful of fresh thyme (rosemary also good), couple crushed unpeeled garlic cloves. Salt & pepper. Toss & bake in low oven - GM 3 until crisp & golden. If REALLY stale, sprinkle with water first.
5378 2018-11-15 15:15:24 ROCKWOOD-Chicken and Prosciutto Carbonara $16
Chicken, Italian prosciutto, garlic, linguine, Parmigiana Reggiano, olive oil and cherry tomatoes.
5379 2018-11-15 15:15:23 It's the excess from those olives we serve at the pub, sometimes we end up with excess oil, and the staff bag that for cooking
5380 2018-11-15 15:15:17 Jiffy lube hires some dumb bitches gone there twice and my oil change light is still on.
5381 2018-11-15 15:15:17 That’s crazy though, when I went without an oil change it just burned my gas quicker but never did I think the mf would just fall through
5382 2018-11-15 15:15:16 One thing I've learned over the years is that the energy complex should move in tandem. When we see divergences, one needs to be very careful or get your face ripped off.  Heating Oil and Crude down, Natty up.
5383 2018-11-15 15:15:14 it was not promised by the football federation but by the governor of the oil rich delta state.this is not the first time Nigeria r using this method,remember they were promised $100.000 a goal against Cameroon and the money was given to d team after d game
5384 2018-11-15 15:15:14 As much as you can call on the president, do try to go a bit step down and call on the state governor that stand as the cheif security officer of the state where these two girls were kidnapped. Also the local Govt chairman and then the CP. Thanks
5385 2018-11-15 15:15:09 Bought my first bottle of truffle oil today #balling
5386 2018-11-15 15:15:04 Arms and oil. Oil and arms.

5389 2018-11-15 15:14:51 1) get a travel humidifier for your desk. Will help a lot.   2) Leonor Greyl oil is great.   3) Honeylab skin moisturizer is great.   4) Neutrogena Norwegian Formula or O’Keefes cream for hands.
5390 2018-11-15 15:14:46 Finally he contacted her and gave the most silly excuse.
5391 2018-11-15 15:14:45 Я себя балую тем, что иногда позволяю себе делать ровно ничего.

Потом правда жалею об этом, но на самом деле, иногда очень сильно задалбываюсь. И когда что-то заканчиваю, делаю себе день отдыха.

5394 2018-11-15 15:14:38 not much to do with Ford. Oil prices are crashing globally.
5395 2018-11-15 15:14:34 $50 says dems say that repubs cheated here
5396 2018-11-15 15:14:32 North sea oil is owned by the UK, not Scotland.

Trouble is the Scots really believe the English are ripping them off
5397 2018-11-15 15:14:25 It will, but unless more pressure is put on halting the extraction and production of oil/gas/etc at the source, it's only tackling the low hanging fruit. People are willing to make small changes (straws, plastic bags) but seem hesitant to make more drastic but needed changes

5401 2018-11-15 15:14:12 agreed. And why does Bigfoot have such a captivating hold on the right wingers? I mean look at the 5th race with Denver?  I thought it was a total lark, but it's totally bizarre. Whitaker is a traitorous toadie & snake oil salesman- He's going to get pinched.I have faith & hope.
5402 2018-11-15 15:14:03 You better join the moving train..oil will become useless in 2030.
Just like palm oil...
Wake up! Most economically viable countries don't have oil...
Oil has become a curse to Nigeria!
5403 2018-11-15 15:13:56 When you come in for an oil change and end up having to spend on fixing other issues...I’ve never been lucky enough to just need an oil change. That or them a con mi.
5404 2018-11-15 15:13:55 Bagus gak bila bukak twitter nampak tweet pasal skimcare.  Terus gigih tepek ke muka.  Malas camne pn. Gigihkn gak. At least. Just HL hydating toner, n mosturiser with rosehip oil.
5405 2018-11-15 15:13:47 Oil companies are very creative in finding opportunities in unoptimized situations. Getting cheap Canadian oil to Midwest refineries. Taking advantage of light shale molecules as Chemicals feedstock.
5406 2018-11-15 15:13:34 No boundaries, reckon. In between sonar jamming of surface vessels, deep sea cable destruction, illegal fishing, building infrastructure on fake islands... and arctic oil drilling #tipoftheiceberg

5409 2018-11-15 15:13:18 So we sell oil at $12 and buy it back from of all places saudi arabia and our governments are ok with that?  No wonder our country is so deep in shit that we cant get out. Trudeau needs to get out. Notley too.

5418 2018-11-15 15:12:43 Palm oil is everywhere in lots of our food products, but palm oil is the cause of massive rain forest destruction and contributes to loss of habitat for orangutans, threatening the species.
5419 2018-11-15 15:12:40 1) The Tories made the arms agreement, not the Liberals.
2) The arms sold include armoured cars, not bullets
2) Saudi oil imports are already lower than ever thanks to booming US production.
3) Govt doesn't decide where private corps buy oil from.
Do some homework before starting
5420 2018-11-15 15:12:37 Online interview booked for 10AM, candidate calls at 9:30AM and asks if we can push it to 11AM because he is getting his oil changed.  I offered to reschedule because I am booked all day, he says no, he will make it.  No shows.  Is it fair that I now refuse to reschedule?
5421 2018-11-15 15:12:36 And my tires need air and i need a oil change what is life 
5422 2018-11-15 15:12:33 What more sad is the oil companies complain there not making money... but the price of gas and diesel keeps goin up. Don’t matter if their producing water.. gas and diesel remains the same and / or goes up

5427 2018-11-15 15:11:57 This country could be everything everyone wants it to be except for the power hungry warmongering few. Stop wasting money on these pointless wars and make us independent on oil and a healthier, more educated society.

5429 2018-11-15 15:11:52 Fires like this can reach over 1200 degrees and can melt aluminum and steel, as far as the asphalt it can catch on fire because it's basically made from oil and diesel. There is nothing in these photos that make me think this was DEW.
5430 2018-11-15 15:11:40 I went to start oil painting only to realize I'm TOTALLY UNPREPARED to oil paint and need MUCH smaller brushes than what I have. This is why artists are always broke. You can't use ONE TYPE of brush for ALL MEDIUMS. You gotta use the OIL brushes with the OIL paints.
5431 2018-11-15 15:11:40 Some thoughts on the oil slump: Seems like Déjà Vu.

It's not 2015 all over again, when oil went from $100/barrel to $42, but the roughly 25% fall in oil price from $86 per barrel to $67 since the beginning of Oct has eventually caught credit investors’ attention. 1/n
5432 2018-11-15 15:11:36 All my chocolate people please oil up today , this wind about to break my ankle 
5433 2018-11-15 15:11:36 I think so. Yebba got soul, some good oil! Most artists with that are popular but not to the overall masses (I.e. J. Sullivan, Ledisi, etc). Yebba would still survive, but Adele prolly would still surpass her in regards to overall popularity.

5435 2018-11-15 15:11:31 This is a huge step for a country of Saudia Arabia. For years, they have relied so much on oil and changes happen slowly. However, with these reforms in economic policy, there is room for huge growth as SA could become more attractive for forgeign investment. #squatMBS
5436 2018-11-15 15:11:21 Yeah, thanks. So you think that banning straws/other single use plastic products won’t affect oil companies at all?

5460 2018-11-15 15:09:09 Very interesting. All agriculture has an impact and I would agree there is a place for Palm Oil. However, it's impact is concentrated to one area, home to one of our closest and most vulnerable relatives - orangutans. Strict control of the industry is needed, not shutting it down
5461 2018-11-15 15:09:07 Kemboy wins the Grade 2 Clonmel Oil Chase for Willie Mullins!

The Ladbrokes Trophy at Newbury could be next on his agenda.
5462 2018-11-15 15:09:06 1 1/3 cups (5 1/2 ounces) unbleached all-purpose flour
2/3 cup (2 3/4 ounces) yellow cornmeal

1/2 teaspoon salt

mix flour, cornmeal and oil, then add salt and water slowly til soft
5463 2018-11-15 15:09:03 Tobe safe, I bought a plain cheese sandwich. It also contains palm oil! A plain cheese sandwich! Why? When I make bread or plain cheese sandwiches I do not use palm oil with. Sustainability is also about being sparing - neither bread nor sandwiches need palm oil @NickyAACampbell

5465 2018-11-15 15:08:51 Compare that to the consumption of animal fats? I don’t think there IS a comparison. Plant fats and animal fats are very different. But you’re right, coconut oil isn’t that great in high consumption. Moderation is key in anything. I don’t think you could eat this every day

5488 2018-11-15 15:07:04 ^^THIS. The New York Time piece includes a statement by one of the protestors saying that their octopus is a clear reference to Standard Oil octopus from 1900s. Rockefellers weren't Jewish either. Protestors picking an ideal image to symbolize a monopoly makes them antisemitic??
5489 2018-11-15 15:07:01 Actually we cannot rely on "Government" and "Science" to save us.  Most of them lie for "Big Oil" and "Big Money".

Lots of vendors are starting to provide mappings against it, and it can lead to a false sense of security for organizations. It's already being distilled, packaged, and sold. Don't turn it into a snake oil ingredient or another blinky box

5511 2018-11-15 15:05:02 You are so uninformed, you should be embarrassed. Cruz was born in a civilian hospital. There is no US military base in Calgary. They were in the oil biz, in Calgary on business. But then how would you know? No one asked for his details. That was saved for the black guy.

@POTUS

...
1- Excruciating oil prices which were unblocked by Bush- actually invited by Bush.
2- A massive drain of the money from our economy by mortgage banks.
3- Fed Reserve rates ramped up.
5514 2018-11-15 15:04:54 After 80.4% increase in oil production due to the investments under @JDMahama led to an 8.1% GDP growth rate in 2017, the economy has contracted to 5.6% in 2018 based on the #2019Budget hence an indication that the NPP government has not been able to sustain the growth rate.

5548 2018-11-15 15:02:52 Once again, May's work is/was to screw the negotiations so badly that a second referendum on #Brexit would become a clear possibility. She is doing well! And she is helped quite successfully by the likes of #Bojo who is to courage what oil is to water...
5549 2018-11-15 15:02:41 I thought that's when you wanted the babe oil!
5550 2018-11-15 15:02:31 I told him he needs to get a skin oil and then he bought tapers. The tapers came in American gauges (we don’t usually go by the mm) so he said he’s in the 4g which is only like 3 sizes away from where he was at
5551 2018-11-15 15:02:29 なんじゃ？
5552 2018-11-15 15:02:26 working on this new oil on canvas piece and it's so... weird
5553 2018-11-15 15:02:25 FEEL GOOD! SHORT THE OIL.
5554 2018-11-15 15:02:24 Это было очень сложно, но невероятно интересно. 

Но только это профильная физика. И очень жаль, что подобные интересные задачи не делают для обычного курса((

5556 2018-11-15 15:02:09 That’s ironic since Putin just stated he & Trump discussed the price of oil when they were in Paris. Wonder why Trump’s team would promote fossil fuels so soon afterward.

5563 2018-11-15 15:01:44 The oil people. Cos the way you just exposed INTELS. I just got new information about their dealings from you.
5564 2018-11-15 15:01:33 There's no better indicator for transitioning into the cold season than one's coconut oil going from liquid to solid.
5565 2018-11-15 15:01:32 Agreed! Maybe Silva isn’t a snake oil salesman after all...

1) Anyone who says they know a perfect, guaranteed path to success is a snake oil salesman.

2) Consistency, positivity, and longevity are the only common factors in successful streams.

3) Do what YOU feel is best for YOUR stream.

5581 2018-11-15 14:59:53 Growing mine out too, use castor oil. It helps build the natural proteins in your hair to make them thicker and hydration is key. It will be worth it in the end!

5588 2018-11-15 14:59:26 @doughboyspod Italian sandwiches were invented in Maine by Giovanni Amato in 1903. The original (still served at Amato's takeouts and every ME convenience store) had ham, amer. cheese, onions, pickles, tomaters, green pep, olives, s, p, and oil on a soft roll. #dontyouknowimlocal
5589 2018-11-15 14:59:23 Assuming you're not kidding - What significant and large industries depend on fish? OK the cod liver oil people will be worried, but apart from them?
5590 2018-11-15 14:59:23 There's a clear problem with assuming intent. Protestors clearly say their posters referenced the Standard Oil octopus from 1900s. That's a very widely known cartoon and as far as I know Rockefellers aren't Jewish. So, no ADL hasn't done a good job. They twisted the narrative.
5591 2018-11-15 14:59:16 Hain acchha, aur aapko lagta hai saste ka fayda aapko hota hai? We are still paying the intrest to oil producers. Us intrest ka paisa kaan ghuma ke har sirkaar nikalti hai. So it doesn't matter ki kam hua yaa jyada. You may save 500 one side but will be taxed somewhere else.
5592 2018-11-15 14:59:10 I know your companies need to make money to fund their research but how about a really good exchange price on people oil based cars for a Tesla then recycle and destroy those old cars.

5598 2018-11-15 14:58:38 I rly like the glossier moisturizer but tbh I also use an oil cream from the body shop for overnight that I love and it doesnt really make my skin overly oily. But then soap I use with it helps balance out sebum production so that's helping.
5599 2018-11-15 14:58:35 My mom praying & signing the cross with anointing oil on my forehead every time I leave her house to drive to my house is highkey very therapeutic & comforting

5607 2018-11-15 14:57:28 People are looking to the Saudis to cut oil production/supply to help balance the market. If the Kingdom "cut from 10.7Mpbpd to 9, it would be producing one-half of the level of the US" according to RR.
5608 2018-11-15 14:57:25 Ikr? The oil messed up their heads. They only care about their country and do not give two shits about the future of the Ummah nationalism at its finest. News flash: KSA is not the center of the Islamic world nor does it represent it. Good luck with the Dajjalic revolution.

5622 2018-11-15 14:56:29 It's so good! I have replaced "chorizo oil" with "actual chorizo," which makes it even yummier (in our opinion, anyway).
5623 2018-11-15 14:56:14 truthfully, hygiene and cleanliness has a lot to do with it. it they stink and their hands are covered in mud or oil, I'd rather not be touched. please wash up!

5625 2018-11-15 14:56:14 I agree with Max. The industry is moving to responsible palm oil namely because of the work of engaged NGOs working with retailers and manufacturers to demand sustainability.
5626 2018-11-15 14:56:12 Please don’t tell the market you find more OIL the price will go to zeeeero

As an Asian I find it crazy that people think it's a healthy alternative.

5652 2018-11-15 14:53:44 Really Derek, that's what your thinking. Just another example of drinking way to much @cathmckenna koolaid.
I'm not against renewables, but they won't ever make Canada the $$$$ oil does.
5653 2018-11-15 14:53:39 I like avocado oil as well.
5654 2018-11-15 14:53:33 Minister Sohi tells us “the review system is flawed” hence the reason we continue to lose billions of dollars to the Canadian economy. I would suggest the lack of pipelines to move our oil is because our government (ie: Trudeau) is flawed.
5655 2018-11-15 14:53:29 Only thing I miss about my ex is when he used to do my oil changes /:
5656 2018-11-15 14:53:21 I don’t know if oil market collapse alone can support the current bull market, but I think its one of the factors that can alter long term outlook a little (delay bear market) if other factors are changed as well.
5657 2018-11-15 14:53:20 Gotta a good ass sleep in waiting for my oil change lol

5667 2018-11-15 14:52:08 No, we're too busy bankrupting the eastern half of the country to fuel our Prarie destroying oil sands project.
5668 2018-11-15 14:52:03 How about stopping oil production and changing over to renewable sources. Even if you somehow don’t believe in global warming, you have to believe oil is limited.

5685 2018-11-15 14:50:18 Decliners with a 18:9 edge this morning... fairly strong for 10 points to the downside. Oil trying to rally. Small caps in line with large caps, the Nasdaq leading the way right now. $VIX up 2.4% but below its opening print.
5686 2018-11-15 14:50:04 the death blow to oil and petroleum based economics will come in the form of highly efficient batteries.

5692 2018-11-15 14:49:30 In Denmark fried  slices are French. The only thing American  that we have is Am. oil referring to ricinus oil. Good laxative, when one happens to be full of shit. Actually I don't know why ricinus is called American - has been since before my time (start at 1951) - 
5693 2018-11-15 14:49:27 Doug - why are you passing on this delusion that you seem to have to the public. Let's say it slowly - YOU DON'T HAVE CONTROL ON WORLD CRUDE OIL PRICES! That's why the price at the pumps is down.  Don't lie. Don't mislead. Tell the truth! Thank you. #Onpoli

5699 2018-11-15 14:49:13 The thing is it’s not like supporting KSA is even politically popular. These people are just earning their oil and blood-soaked paychecks.

5720 2018-11-15 14:48:10 New oil may be hard to see on the dipstick. You can lay the dipstick onto a paper towel to show where the oil level is, or you can shine a light onto the dipstick. Please let us know if you have any other questions!

5740 2018-11-15 14:46:26 Ask Mr. Iriving how much he pays for Saudi oil - because that's who buys it (well, him and other refineries). As for oil sands discount, that's what happens in gluts.

5742 2018-11-15 14:46:23 We lived in saudi before they discover the oil its our land. If god blessed us with oil of course u will see many haters and jealously.if u think saudi is devil then who is the angel ? Who do u support iran? Or turkey ?so i can know what is your politic vision

5751 2018-11-15 14:45:33 But Westminster has just proved itself to be moronically stupid & useless.

5755 2018-11-15 14:44:51 If oil prices rise, they might be able to bootstrap their oil industry. Maybe.

Why does US have 19 military bases in Syria?  Uninvited!

5777 2018-11-15 14:42:57 Hat? Why would I need a hat in falling snow and freezing rain when coconut oil naturally freezes with hair to offer helmet-like protection.
5778 2018-11-15 14:42:32 Thanks for the question, Dan. On certain Ariens Sno-Thro models, the oil fill port is near the base of the engine. If you're having trouble finding it, tell us the model number and serial number of your unit, and we'll show you where it is.
5779 2018-11-15 14:42:18 What are we actually looking at? It looks like perhaps oil paint drops on a water surface or so?

5786 2018-11-15 14:41:43 Here's chance number one for you AOC. Why didn't they attack a cause like abortion or immigration?... Because they make all their money from Green energy. Like the Reps do on oil. So they tricked you like a kid, into helping then regain money control on their first issue.

5789 2018-11-15 14:41:26 I've always believed Puljujarvi would be a player at this level and continue to but comparing him to Rantanen is truly an apples to oranges thing. Have never viewed Jesse with that kind of ceiling. That said, he does ned to play w/ skill. No question.
5790 2018-11-15 14:41:24 Just like any engine from that era, if you maintained it, had the carburetor adjusted properly so you did not pollute the oil they went forever. Most breaker points would last much longer than 10K miles as long a you put the proper grease on the distributor cam.
5791 2018-11-15 14:41:21 I’ve been going to the same oil change place for the last 10 years because it’s the only place that doesn’t try to swindle me into buying stuff I don’t need

This itself, should give you pause. WHY is nobody funding studies that counter the scientific consensus?

Why don't they?
5887 2018-11-15 14:34:05 Nuclear’s ability to be independent makes it a threat to the oil industry. Nuclear’s complexity makes it appear threatening to Greens. Ergo, the obvious move for oil is to encourage technologies that cannot stand alone, hence wind and solar advocacy. Their unreliability is key.

5959 2018-11-15 14:26:56 He says things. Naughty stuff. Like, you're getting a tax cut. More jobs. Better economy.  Fewer regulations. Pay increases. Stronger military. Oil independence.  You never heard Obama say bad things like these.
5960 2018-11-15 14:26:54 @Chitown33 US oil refiners shut in for maintenance should be back online in two weeks. So US have been storing oil for 8 weeks.

5963 2018-11-15 14:26:51 Oh ok. Are you aware of their oil reserves? Do you know the kind of political systems they run in those countries? Are you aware of the human rights issues in those states?
5964 2018-11-15 14:26:46 You might be right, but if you declare it for internal affairs, what the hell are you doing in Yemen and ohter Countries and financing Terrorism?? Without Oil this State wouldn't play any Case. Absolutely nothing to say! I call them Bananarepublic.
5965 2018-11-15 14:26:40 I’ve done oil change but on American cars and Japanese vehicles. Never on a German car.

5984 2018-11-15 14:24:56 I agree we can’t be hand cuffed to the . But how much of this pricing difference is because of our much higher processing costs to mine the sands & extract the oil?

5988 2018-11-15 14:24:22 It's getting cold. Family, go ahead and get that preventative maintenance done on your whip. Maintain good oil levels. Get your brakes done. All of what you can while you can.

It's also horribly broken.

You can make mostly everything out of JUST energy eventually, INCLUDING Rocket Parts.

Early-game, you make ores/water/wood/oil
5990 2018-11-15 14:24:12 Fracking is causing additional problems to climate change so IMO is even worse than tar sands. We can’t shut down oil until alternatives are in place for areas like health care. As for fuel, accelerating energy sources and electric cars would at least obviate their effect.
5991 2018-11-15 14:24:05 Profitable, not yet affordable. We will always need oil to produce green energy. Why not invest in it, make a profit from it while we can, use that profit to build the infrastructure that will make green energy affordable. It’s a transition, it takes time.
5992 2018-11-15 14:24:02 I  blend the CBD oil with coconut oil. Taking Turmeric, magnesium, b2. Along with cutting everything white out of my diet.

Small amounts of oil is no big thing. Bacteria will eat it eventually. I had a field once that had some oil in it. I just didn't like to see it when it rained.

6003 2018-11-15 14:23:07 Here in America we can decide if we want to do business with murderous regimes.  We don’t have to sell them weapons, and we don’t have to buy their oil.  That’s why it matters, but I’m sure you already knew that.

6005 2018-11-15 14:22:59 Yup, the lil guys take the hit. The big boys have the rest swept under the rug. Saudi has 226 billion barrels of proven oil reserve, the U.S. has 36 billion for an oil-based economy.. Who do ya' think is gonna' win this one?

6012 2018-11-15 14:22:08 Internal combustion engines, well oiled, are a wonder. Until your PCV valve gums up. That's positive crankcase ventilation for your base. If it can't vent the oil comes out, generally onto an overheated exhaust. Only one option: shut 'er down and run like hell." She's gonna Blow"
6013 2018-11-15 14:21:56 We have chosen to make our rich oil resources more accessible to credible investors through competitive bidding and we aim to hit, God willing, a million barrels of crude oil production within a matter of a decade

6014 2018-11-15 14:21:53 Oil is needed for plastics not just fuels. Your pacemaker probably is dependent on oil. You can’t shut oil down sans having a huge, deleterious effect. Oil from countries other than Norway and Canada is involved in wholesale slaughter in places like Yemen, Crimea, Venezuela.
6015 2018-11-15 14:21:44 @Chitown33 Saudi’s dumped a bunch of oil because Trump wanted lower oil prices. Iran suctions a joke. So too much oil at one time.

6033 2018-11-15 14:20:05 The reason we're trying to raise money is that money is extremely tight this season. With being in fall and winter fast approaching money is too tight right now for us to get heating oil to warm our home for the season. So we're humbly asking for help.
6034 2018-11-15 14:19:57 Then tell the French government to stop interfering in African and Arab affairs, there is no reason they should have over 50 military bases in Africa, hidden payments to ruthless dictators and collecting revenue from mines & oil rigs in Africa. Just look at the Congo for example

6036 2018-11-15 14:19:50 Buying an ageing pipeline to pump tar sands into the Pacific Ocean is not a climate plan. Subsidizing transnational oil companies to the tune of $3B+ is not a climate plan. Stop lying and start moving into the 21st Century.

6048 2018-11-15 14:19:12 But so is the Sahara desert, also, in relative scale. What matters most is being focussed on finding the precise location of commercial oil/gas fields, to minimise capex, long-lived reserves, nearby infrastructure, and a hospitable tax regime.

6096 2018-11-15 14:14:57 Of course they are not. If governments did not exist, companies would take oil and coal out of the ground economically and sell it for a profit. Not so with wind and solar.
6097 2018-11-15 14:14:48 I'll only agree for the sole reason that I just started using cocunut oil for my beard and it's absolute magic...how I didn't know about this earlier is beyond me

6102 2018-11-15 14:14:29 Iceland's advert sent a clear important message warning of deforestation and destroying animal habitats due to the exploration of palm oil. IT WAS BANNED!!  John Lewis you choose to have self promoting Elton John on your advert - shame on you - it is totally disappointing.

6123 2018-11-15 14:12:43 I dont know if that is true but if it is as you suggest, you're right. 80% of venezuelas economy is based on oil. I doubt scandanavian countries are. Venezuela sits on the largest oil reserve in the world. Why wouldnt the U.S. try to invade...why are we still in Afghanistan?

6231 2018-11-15 14:04:46 While we tweet the War of Terror has already killed millions of Muslims & is still happening as the U$ bombs 8 Muslim nations, all for oil. I learned that killing 6 million Jews was called a Holocaust & a genocide.

If you are against violence, are you not also against genocide?

6247 2018-11-15 14:03:22 Go back and review our tweets. I asked for evidence that the US ENGOs were deliberately not targeting American pipeline projects. News stories about US celebrities hating on the oil sands is not that. Also, you ignored my Texas question.
6248 2018-11-15 14:03:20 The world is looking at electric cars in developed countries. Very soon the world will have no use for crude oil if we don't Niger Delta immediately.

6251 2018-11-15 14:03:15 Got the vehicle I wanted in the payment range I wanted. Excellent customer service. And what more could you ask for when they throw in free oil changes for 60 months?  Very happy and will be coming back for my next vehicle!

6266 2018-11-15 14:01:38 Actually it seems to me that given the aim of these American investors, environmentalists aren’t helping their cause either because the oil is still being taken out of the ground. It’s just going to be out of American soil rather than Canadian if investors have their way.

6325 2018-11-15 13:57:13 Easy, Canada has the 3rd largest proven oil reserves in the world. To stop us from competing on the world market the pipelines that would bring the product to tidewater can't be built. For a measly $7mill/year that has been achieved in spades!

6342 2018-11-15 13:56:09 Basically govt treats climate breakdown as security threat. As if going to war, govt wd mobilise resources, inc fin'al resources in defence of US citizens.Rationing (e.g.oil/carbon) probably. Everything necessary to secure the futures of Americans.

6344 2018-11-15 13:55:52 Markets, oil headed low is a sign of worse to come. High dollar is also a sign of a slow down. @realDonaldTrump policies hitting hard. Need @BarackObama back to clean up and get the market back in shape.

6365 2018-11-15 13:54:19 Do you use essential oils at all? Peppermint oil helps ease my migraines when they just start coming on. It doesn’t take it fully away but it does help if you like a more natural approach.  Headaches are not fun and I totally feel you
6366 2018-11-15 13:54:15 Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it upon his head, and kissed him, and said, Is it not because the LORD hath anointed thee to be captain over his inheritance?

It's actually best to use an engine sensibly from cold, rather than leaving it to warm up. A little load helps the warming process.

Don't thrash it from cold. The oil will not be flowing properly and some of the additives in...

6395 2018-11-15 13:52:23 So what is your position on climate change again? That it’s not happening? That it’s happening but it’s caused by the sun? That you “scientists” don’t know the difference between weather and climate? Doesn’t matter, as long as your big oil sponsors are happy right?

6491 2018-11-15 13:42:19 As for nutella, they say that they are sustainable with where they get the palm oil. I also saw an exhibit on our zoo that said the same thing.

6499 2018-11-15 13:41:43 The economists talking of oil prices are idiots. Whenever the Royal Family needs money or have to pay off something, or manage their princelings, they will cut production & buy oil futures. Make billions & then do drama of increasing output.

6505 2018-11-15 13:40:41 The basic of it is that a lot of the companies are not using sustainable ways to get the palm oil aka they’re destroying the trees when it’s not even needed. so the orangutans are losing their homes bc the forests that they live in are being turned into palm tree plantations

6518 2018-11-15 13:39:22 Very good explanation. But this is not a prediction. Nor even a market expectation. It is too naive to predict oil price by supply and demand only. The geoplolitics is a big player.

6603 2018-11-15 13:31:02 No catch. The price of crude oil has just dropped significantly. I'm not quite sure why, but I know that it's to do with an excess reserve or something in the states.
6604 2018-11-15 13:31:02 #OOTT So whats next for OPEC in perspective: 
Not only to adjust crude oil production, but Middle distillate/Heavy distillate/Light distillate export. That way they can regulate market more precisely

We purchase 100% of our palm oil from RSPO-certified sources.

6628 2018-11-15 13:29:12 BITD, my first barracks roommate and I couldn’t stand each other. Water and oil. We went to the Gunny for room changes. The Gunny confirmed that we were going to be roommates for at least the next three years. We got over it and he’s probably reading this now.
6629 2018-11-15 13:29:10 People voted in good faith on an incredibly complex issue and were deliberately misled by snake oil merchants like Farage and Johnson, with a little help from the Kremlin.

6667 2018-11-15 13:25:00 I guess you meant infrastructure! The issue is not about just financing the infrastructural needs, its all about accepting a financing model that shall not stress our calculated oil related benefits. This is a finite resource - how smart we play our cards now matters a lot.
6668 2018-11-15 13:24:51 That’s a win for Texas. You avoided another batch of tens of thousands of progressive voters moving in ready to vote for the next Beto.
6669 2018-11-15 13:24:43 Norway is independent because of it's well developed natural resources, oil and fish.
If you want independence push for the rights of your fishermen and become independent of other countries for your energy needs. Perhaps May's hands are tied.

6759 2018-11-15 13:15:02 @RizzShow the biggest mistake on frying a turkey is the lowering of the turkey into the oil. If you go to fast the oil will boil over. Lower slowly. It could take a good couple minutes to completely submerge.
6760 2018-11-15 13:15:01 Amazed to see #RegalPetroleum back in the low 50s given the strength and resilience of NAT GAS (not the US!).  Those reacting to the oil price are following the wrong commodity.  Will be worth keeping tabs on it - I expect the price to base here before swiftly building again

6777 2018-11-15 13:13:36 Been so distracted today with Brexit that I'd forgotten to tweet. Here's something for the #OOTT community: Russia says it's cool with current oil price ... “Where it is now, where it was recently, anything around $70 suits us completely.” He wouldn't commit to cutting output
6778 2018-11-15 13:13:27 I’m love the smell of tea tree oil so much and it’s so beneficial for skin but I’m allergic to it

6807 2018-11-15 13:10:02 Some good sleep will help.  I don’t mean for this to sound trite or minimize what you’re feeling at all but this is ‘my day job’.  Try lavender oil on the tip of your nose, lie down and count backwards from 100 as many times as you need- it quiets the brain so you can sleep.

6812 2018-11-15 13:09:31 We exported over $2.8 billion worth of crude oil in 2017, but still imported $1.7 billion of refined petroleum products such as petrol. Government will in 2019 begin the groundwork for the establishment of a petrochemicals hub. - Ken Ofri-Atta

They’ll work as floorhands for $15/hr when $20-25/hr was standard pay for a roughneck 10 years ago.

6853 2018-11-15 13:04:07 Hi Suzanne, we've worked hard throughout the year to remove palm oil as an ingredient in all own label products. There are a number of products in our tertiary ranges which still include the ingredients, however our stance has always been to offer consumers choice (1/2)
6854 2018-11-15 13:04:01 some might be made with honey or milk or palm oil or gelatin

6858 2018-11-15 13:03:34 1. Preheat oil (in a fryer or medium pot filled about 3 inches) to 350°.
2. Place cream cheese, mushrooms and black pepper in a small mixing bowl and mix together until completely combined. Scoop mixture into a Ziploc bag and snip one corner off.

6884 2018-11-15 13:01:20 I expect oil to ultimately to plunge to new lows below the 2016 lows in the coming bust. We could see WTI fall to as low as $10 for a short while. The bust will hit global demand hard. Near-term, oil has fallen 28% in 6 wks so a bounce is likely.

7011 2018-11-15 12:48:26 Totally agree. Let them bring that to us when they stop chopping down the rainforest for soya and palm oil. Or when container ships stop bring billions of tonnes of future landfill from China. It’s only because they darent tackle the air industry.

7019 2018-11-15 12:48:09 It isn't.
It's BS from an oil company for profit.
It takes huge energy to create hydrogen.
Its many many times more efficient to collect solar, wind,tidal energy & distribute by grid.

7063 2018-11-15 12:43:27 There were rumours of Obama administration being behind the price drop, but yes, probably just wishful thinking. Just an observation that drop in oil prices appears to be much more effective than any of the sanctions so far.

7317 2018-11-15 12:17:42 I was label reading yesterday and palm oil is everywhere, very worrying.
7318 2018-11-15 12:17:25 We’re in the mess we are because having a sensible discussion of facts doesn’t make for good viewing/listening figures or newspaper sales. So the grandstanding charlatans of Brexit keep being allowed to offer snake oil unchallenged. 
7319 2018-11-15 12:17:13 There's nary a candle nor a drop of whale oil in this desolate abode.

7324 2018-11-15 12:16:45 Yeah some of that oil sank and is sitting in the gulf at a depth almost impossible get at.  People on average dont care until it happens in their neighborhood, then it's a catastrophe.
7325 2018-11-15 12:16:41 because it's just a marketing ploy. People are so concerned about Palm Oil. But it's the lowest cause of destruction. if people really cared about animals they would adopt a more plant based diet. I'm not vegan, but I have cut my meat and dairy consumption way down.

7336 2018-11-15 12:15:38 I'm still confused why we even have any dealings with the Saudi's. They have been a problem before and after 9-11. We can drill our own oil until we replace it with another energy source.

7609 2018-11-15 11:44:19 No such a thing like sustainable palm oil. RSPO standards forbid deforestation only in “high conservation value areas,” a term that has no legal definition. And a trader who earns an RSPO certificate can go on to mix “clean” and uncertified oil.

Coconut oil based lotions or creams work really well too.

7944 2018-11-15 11:00:16 Nobody blocks a pipeline and then goes "since we are going to get less Alberta oil I will get an electric car", people protest pipelines and then go back to normal life, which is why pipelines are a choice between foreign oil and Canadian oil, nothing to do with renewables.

7975 2018-11-15 10:54:36 you literally just keep assuming things from what i am saying. palm oil is vegan. PERSONALLY, i try and avoid it when possible

7980 2018-11-15 10:53:05 @iamjohnoliver  Research the 2008 movie 'W.' , go to watch Richard Dreyfuss playing Dick Cheney when he says "Drain the Swamp" on his overtaking of Iraq & Afghanistan for oil resources.  Chilling irony if that phrase wasn't stolen for Trump's 2016 campaign market.
7981 2018-11-15 10:52:48 Due to OIL reserves comfortable oil prices my be  slashed
7982 2018-11-15 10:52:42 You'd take a dictatorship for lower oil prices? This captures very well the Rajapaksa bandwagon. All supporters driven purely by self interests. Thanks for showing this to the world.

7997 2018-11-15 10:49:15 @Exxon Mobil has invested 9billion USD in developing clean energy technology since 2000, partnering with more than 80 universities. 2 examples: storing the CO2 exhausts of industries to produce, using algae that absorb CO2 , clean water and produce oil that can be used as fuel!!
7998 2018-11-15 10:49:15 No surprised, it wasn’t that long ago when she was threatening to nationalize the oil industry in the US... people have very short memories

palm oil is vegan.

8015 2018-11-15 10:46:25 Well who pushed down the oil price was USA.... via SPR and coercive policy with KSA

8019 2018-11-15 10:45:02 It takes many tugs to stop an oil tanker and I think we should celebrate each fig leaf  while pushing for many more. Algal research has been messy but could still be worthwhile. Mind you, the ability to deliver 10,000 barrels a day by 2025 isn't that impressive. We are so.. /2
8020 2018-11-15 10:44:53 I have a sneaking suspicion the rUK would happily trade with iScotland, 
they want, in fact NEED, our gas, oil, electricity, water & food.
8021 2018-11-15 10:44:28 @CMOTamilNadu Kudos to your people centric governance and your team of Ministers are bent upon burning midnight oil to offer best of services. Awareness is exemplary
8022 2018-11-15 10:44:25 Like an engine without oil, #TheresaMay's govt is grinding to an abrupt halt through ministerial resignations. Election now.
8023 2018-11-15 10:44:19 I gave you a list of palm oil free cosmetics, you stated they didn’t test on animals, you claimed that palm oil free products are a luxury. And I’m assuming in order to be vegan now one must only buy palm oil free because a vegan must not damage the sacred earth in any way

8032 2018-11-15 10:42:56 Hi Madeline, As there is no requirement to include on our packaging that we use sustainable palm oil and due to lack of space on pack, this is not currently declared. Our RSPO member number is 4-0022-07-000-00. More info can be found on the RSPO website. Thanks!
8033 2018-11-15 10:42:49 Considering Benjamin Graham's differentiation between an "investment" and "speculation," can anyone ever "invest" in any commodity (such as oil or gold) that is well known to have a manipulated markets? Or can we ever only really "speculate" on such markets?

8057 2018-11-15 10:39:44 does anyone know if when palm oil is listed in products it's just called palm oil or will it have other names or is there anything it's in that will be listed that's misleading
8058 2018-11-15 10:39:43 @BGSenquiries your press office don't answer calls or return emails so I hope you can answer a question. There is news of intention to hydraulically frack in Cornwall for geothermal energy, do they face the same regulations as oil and gas industry on fracking?

8070 2018-11-15 10:37:22 @MichaelRosenYes glad to find you on Twitter. I have a question to ask you. In my mind I remember a programme on Channel 4 in the 80's where furniture was made from pallets and oil drums and old carpet reels, were you the host and what was it called?
8071 2018-11-15 10:37:08 Idk where he change or what type of oil he use lar but he knows a lot about cars because he's a car freak that's why he knows how to cut down the whole cost while maintaining his mercedes at a top notch performance

8176 2018-11-15 10:20:48 Yes, definitely uneven. Also crucial: the oil palm issue can't be understood in isolation (as so often happens) but as part of a wider set of political, economic, social, etc. devts and power dynamics. It's also about dreams of modernity, nat'l identity, local politics, etc.

8190 2018-11-15 10:18:35 Did you misread Peter? Greenpeace said that they are against a ban and I similarly think that might not be a good idea. Before any major palm oil policy decisions are made we need to understand how that affects environments and people elsewhere. Maybe also including Finnish peat

8195 2018-11-15 10:18:01 do you not think i know how much it costs to live on a plant based diet? 
plus palm oil is basically in everything, i’d be surprised if working class single parents can afford the luxury of choosing specifically palm oil free products
8196 2018-11-15 10:17:55 But in South-East Asia it kills rainforests, whereas UK based oils compete with much less ecologically valuable pastures. It's a difficult issue where consumption reduction looks best, but until ecological damage per kg of oil is so high with palm oil, its boycott is defensible.

8210 2018-11-15 10:16:23 Well, except the UK will be a rule-taker like Norway, but without the massive oil dividends.
8211 2018-11-15 10:16:09 Try castor oil, hair oil, or benefits magnet.
8212 2018-11-15 10:16:07 And to make it more interesting, there were 2 years where oil hit USD120 according to that graph.

1980 & 2008 - both years wherein Mahathir was not running the administration.

1980 - He was Minister of Trade & Industry
2008 - He retired in 2003.
8213 2018-11-15 10:16:05 I’m on an Oil Rig on the Grand Banks right now. We haven’t seen the numbers you are reporting. The highest we’ve seen are approx 12.5 m significant and 27m max. Makes for an interesting day at work none the less.
8214 2018-11-15 10:16:00 If you read the history of Saudi, you can see that most Muslims didn't want to be like them, until the Saudi got oil and used oil money to bribe the imam around the world to preach their version of culture and religion. We muslim malaysian used to have our own way
8215 2018-11-15 10:15:58 Check your Engine oil this Sunday.
8216 2018-11-15 10:15:54 What the Saudis had been supplying the market with, were not from Riyadh’s spare capacity but from tapping oil stocks.Iran is expecting addition of 3 billion cubic feet of natural gas added to its daily production capacity by launching new South Pars phases by early 2019
8217 2018-11-15 10:15:46 Good news this morning for @Azinor_Catalyst with Agar-Plantain discovery. 15-50mmboe of oil which could be tied back to Beryl fairly easily, so potentially good news for Apache too!
8218 2018-11-15 10:15:38 Yes... what’s your point? The difference between you and me is you’re a deluded ramping twat (aka a liar) and I’ll say it as it is. The fact that you repeatedly stated that there was no oil at HH is rather shameful.
8219 2018-11-15 10:15:30 Oriental Cafe, Cowley Road, northern Chinese food. Think potato noodles, trotter broth, home made chilli oil. Proper proper proper. Magdalen only ok. Olis thai Good. Oxford kitchen very good. Spiced roots for West Indian. Kasbah cheap and cheerful tapas in a cool building.
8220 2018-11-15 10:15:25 You obviously didn't see the Telegraph article telling the English that we'll be fine. Scottish oil will bale us out again! Watched a film comparing Norway's policies to ours that would make you weep.Trillions in their oil fund
8221 2018-11-15 10:15:19 Attorney General @Geoffrey_Cox compared Brexit agreement to a life raft made up of oil drums and a plastic sail. How long before it sinks?

8225 2018-11-15 10:14:30 "The whitest and nastiest things in the world cannot be pursued or even pursued - they must be washed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
8226 2018-11-15 10:14:23 We're 12 years away from losing the planet, we should not be fighting to get oil anywhere. Yes time to raise corp tax rate, it's incredibly low. Idc about pipeline rev if it's killing our planet. Free trade kills jobs + cedes power to corporations through ISDS. Wages are stagnant
8227 2018-11-15 10:14:15 What has been accomplished by GOP is nothing in comparison to the vile provocation, hatred n racism. Oil/copper may undo progress in 2019,
8228 2018-11-15 10:13:58 @LBC seriously how many times does O’Brien say snake oil...
8229 2018-11-15 10:13:56 Snake Oil salesmen.
8230 2018-11-15 10:13:39 US grants sanctions waivers to some buyers Iran’s oil due to lack of supply-demand balance.
In the run-up to midterm elections, Trump artificially cuts oil and gasoline provinces, but they will naturally keep rising in coming months.
8231 2018-11-15 10:13:35 The rate bitcoin is going down today, I hope it won’t discover crude oil #ThursdayThoughts
8232 2018-11-15 10:13:25 Did the $s on my dinner tonight. Excluding basics like oil, salt, soy, pepper.

Bok choi, gai lan, chili, garlic, noodles. Enough for 2 meals. $1.80ish. And yes. I have the freedom to choose my vendors and be selective. And my meal was amazing. All local. All pretty damn decent.

8248 2018-11-15 10:11:15 do you use dirty palm oil though?
8249 2018-11-15 10:11:09 Please RT.
So, which is the more worthwhile Christmas advert. John Lewis giving Elton's life story, or Iceland highlighting the loss of rain forest to grow palm oil, killing the Orang-utans in the process?
8250 2018-11-15 10:11:00 Its a pleasure for me being present at Orchid Hotels Lekki where Agbami STEM Programme 2018 was organised by partnership with @Chevron @NNPCgroup, famfa oil, LBS sustainability Centre and Stat Oil.

8253 2018-11-15 10:10:54 Are you seriously suggesting that England won’t trade with an independent Scotland?

We sell them water, gas, oil and electricity.

They will be sitting -  in the dark, with no heating and possibly no showers! 

However Putin might give them a quote!

8254 2018-11-15 10:10:48 Iceland's palm oil advert was a Christmas ad that mattered
8255 2018-11-15 10:10:48 Been saying leaving was shit for three years.
For the past two I've been eating my words to Commissioner Moedas a week before the vote that 'Brits won't fall for Nigel's xenophobic snake oil'
It 'ain't over yet.

8264 2018-11-15 10:09:42 Because veganism is an elitist diet. Barely any working class, especially single parents can afford the diet however everyone can afford to stop using palm oil
8265 2018-11-15 10:09:40 My morning mocha coffee with 1 tablespoon Virgin Coconut oil will last me not hungry till dinner time on my 23/1 Fasting day.
8266 2018-11-15 10:09:38 Rune Nielsen tells #liveablecity big bonus of district heating is ease of changing fuel type. Danes have used biomass, waste incineration, natural gas, oil & heat storage. Surprisingly still using coal till 2030. Easier to switch one central system to new eco sources
8267 2018-11-15 10:08:53 Went on your website last night, all your palm free foods that are alternatives to my normal shop, gone on my list. Great idea to have a section just for the palm oil range. Could do with a chocolate alternative, as don't buy Cadbury anymore.

8269 2018-11-15 10:08:32 If Pelosi sets up a committee of non-scientists we get nowhere. The power of gas and oil is too powerful in DC. Someone better would not be beholden to campaign contributions. She is a money grabber.

8279 2018-11-15 10:06:20 Big thanks to Iceland for their Xmas advert. Palm oil production and the rainforest destruction allied with it is not a political issue. It's an issue that affects us all, and it's a total disgrace that the ad isn't being shown. Your bad, Come on Clearcast, do the decent thing.

8292 2018-11-15 10:04:56 The 71% stated in the article cannot be reduced without major consumer changes either. Who do you think consumes fossil fuels produced/mined by these oil and gas conpanies?  

You’re being asked to change either way. It’s just far easier to make huge changes via food choices.

8301 2018-11-15 10:03:18 Coconut oil is perfect 4 cooking, has high smoke point, doesn't go rancid. more importantly, it doesn't change molecular structure under heat like industrial seed oils & canola. Some foods, seeds were never meant to be made into oil. have 2 go thru denaturing processes to be made

8340 2018-11-15 09:56:50 5k mg of fish oil, 400mgs of magnesium and 16oz of coffee was a terrible idea xD
8341 2018-11-15 09:56:48 Oil went up obviously
8342 2018-11-15 09:56:47 وزارة الداخلية تجدد المناشدة للمواطنين والمقيمين بعدم الخروج من منازلهم إلا للضرورة .. نظراً لعدم استقرار الطقس حسب توقعات إدارة الأرصاد الجوية
8343 2018-11-15 09:55:45 I mean there are more Muslims than anyone in the world, and the world is reliant on oil which is vast in the majority Muslim countries. Maybe they secretly bought our CIA and are using weirdo secret lasers to bomb us from space 
8344 2018-11-15 09:55:41 I think it was quite a common model of post-col devt and nation-building. N.B. it wasn't just oil palm - rubber and cocoa, among other crops, were also part of this larger process. We need to look at the whole picture - rural devt, indigenous-state power dynamics, pop'n control.
8345 2018-11-15 09:54:54 @zee_balz pls do u knw ha personally, there is potential candidates who has prblm with his proposed, sabida she needs the opposite of the said sister's request.

8347 2018-11-15 09:54:40 Full Marks to Iceland Foods for actually taking the orangutan by the scruff of its neck and showing the world how they have suffered because of palm oil
For the video to be banned shows the extent of insincerity in the marketing of foods
8348 2018-11-15 09:54:28 I don't suppose it has anything to do with ConocoPhilips' plans to start selling off its remaining North Sea assets by the end of this year....? UK crude oil loads at Teesport and the industry probably employs a fair few people..

8350 2018-11-15 09:54:00 oh THAT AHA recommendation. That archaic thinking still doing the rounds. they're in cahoots with veg oil producers.  Ppl's health is at stake. Be more responsible.
8351 2018-11-15 09:53:55 Don't you love how the algos are now set to selling stocks when oil goes down or when Brexit has hiccups? Where are the real buyers or the real sellers. I will take anything real.
8352 2018-11-15 09:53:54 Hey, just want to ask and make sure. A lot of people think pot is pot. For Crohn's gut spasms definately stick with an Indica. Sativas will stimulate hunger, but it won't do anything for spasms or pain. And if you REALLY want pain relief from MMJ I suggest Rick Simpson Oil (RSO).
8353 2018-11-15 09:53:31 Baaaaaaaaaare stiff. Need some cod liver oil.
8354 2018-11-15 09:53:21 Also made some fresh lemonade. Tried out a new technique. Muddled the whole sliced lemons with the sugar. That way you get that lemon oil in there to lend extra flavor besides the sour flavor. Next time I'll add some raspberries or mint to enhance the lemon syrup.

8361 2018-11-15 09:51:57 Hello Mr “there is no oil”.... hope you’ve read today’s RNS stating that we’ve had 10,000 barrels of the black stuff so far during the EWT!  I see #ffwd are still doing well! 
8362 2018-11-15 09:51:56 Isn’t falling oil prices good for manufacturing, distribution, inflation etc.? Yet, when running with the pack, media analysts add this to the story of economic woe

8374 2018-11-15 09:49:37 Completely agree. The industry is subsidized in numerous ways already. Oil production must be phased-out carefully in coming years to address climate change. Nice to know industry supports using provincial powers to do so.
8375 2018-11-15 09:49:14 US stock futures are up, yes up, 0.2% with Europe higher and Asia mixed.  Oil is $56.23 with gold at $1,215.  Thursday is feeling like Friday.  Find a reason to smile on a cold day. May the day be a hot one in the markets!

8380 2018-11-15 09:48:50 Why are you bothered about the name?
8381 2018-11-15 09:48:48 The price has to drop. Oil has fallen by close to $10 over the past month and a half.

8384 2018-11-15 09:48:27 Obviously there are exceptions - that prove the rule - but a falling £ is not good for a country that has to import raw materials, oil and gas, and half its food.

8386 2018-11-15 09:48:21 Xmas adverts: Iceland isn’t a Xmas advert and they have a cheek when 1000s of the products they sell still have palm tree oil in it. And John Lewis is basically just a trailer for Elton’s Film. So calm the F down Facebook. (Heathrow’s one is decent though)
8387 2018-11-15 09:48:20 “Lead them from temptation, make them royalty. All the things we’re facing make us question it. Lead us to salvation, pour that oil, please. That’s how we become kings and queens.”
8388 2018-11-15 09:47:35 first time way off the mark.
1. saturated fat dies NOT cause heart disease. Sugar, hi insulin does
2. the body's preferred energy source is fat
3. coconut oil is anti inflammatory, antimicrobial, antibacterial.
4. look up medium chain triglycerides. MCTs
5. also lauric acid
8389 2018-11-15 09:47:24 past that now, need to let the Brexiteer hard line snake oil salespeople take over & fail. Only then will some sanity come of this

8403 2018-11-15 09:45:24 IMF: Qatar’s economic performance continues to strengthen. Non-hydrocarbon output grew by about 6 percent during the first half of 2018, as the economy recovered from the impact of the diplomatic rift and oil prices surged.#QNA

8406 2018-11-15 09:44:58 And if prices in 2019 or 2020 reversed above that upper trendline that keeps falling since 2008, you would call that the most bullish breakout since the oil embargo?  With USA as a net exporter of crude now and China net importer we're on the brink of a supply shock coming.
8407 2018-11-15 09:44:53 Who'd have thought that these snake oil salesmen would fail so spectacularly when given the power to actually deliver on their hyperbole. When people are allowed to dismiss the input of experts as "scaremongering" then this is what happens #BrexitChaos
8408 2018-11-15 09:44:51 Apparently John Lewis don't even sell pianos, but they do sell lots of flowers and olive oil, which are also popular gifts for some.
8409 2018-11-15 09:44:46 This morning's big drop in #UKOG SP after reporting ever more oil allegedly flowing from the Horse Hill well test is eerily similar to the way $LG.V's SP keeps falling as the deal announcements - and equity fundraisings - proliferate. It's the familiar #Lenigas Death Spiral.

8411 2018-11-15 09:44:31 Very interesting! I wonder how the Sarawak govt at the time came to the conclusion that oil palm was a means of rural devt...? Do you think the govt at the time anticipated a massive interest from the private sector?
8412 2018-11-15 09:44:26 IMF : QCB’s foreign exchange reserves are expected to reach about US$36 billion in 2019 , significant fiscal and external buffers have enabled Qatar to successfully absorb the adverse shocks from the 2014-16 decline in oil prices and the diplomatic rift.#QNA

8443 2018-11-15 09:39:47 I think that question should be directed to Tinubu & the northern elites.

8459 2018-11-15 09:36:49 We could take areas where the natural environment has already been destroyed (Western Europe, USA and large parts of India and China) and grow oil crops here.  Lower yielding oil crops in these areas are better than destroying ecologically important areas elsewhere.

8473 2018-11-15 09:35:03 Assad committed other crimes. One is that he didn't accept to privatize oil. Syrian Petroleum Company still controls most of Syrian oil production, including a 50% stake in Al Furat (and in Amrit, Awda, Dujla, Hayyan, Kawkab, Deir Ezzor). The rest is owned by China and NL not US.

8536 2018-11-15 09:27:02 [You must ask WHY Venezuela ended up with foreign debt.]
Simple.  Chavez told US and Bush Vn could supply oil for 100 years @ min $55.
That $55 clears cost.  Oil was $100 and hit $140 under Bush.
What's it been last decade? $25-35.
You do math.

8538 2018-11-15 09:26:34 Thanks! Short answer: it varies. E.g. in Sarawak, oil palm was introduced by the state in the 60s as a means of rural devt; private sector got increasingly involved from the 80s. But it's always been tied up with qs about native customary land rights and rural devt.

Keep a ABC Portable Fire Extinguisher in the car or trunk (especially if doing your own repairs or wiring).
If overheating turn heater on high.

8587 2018-11-15 09:18:44 DSI,
for Venezuela to be solvent, they must "import" foreign currency from oil exports, to pay foreign oil tech debts.
But tar-oil production costs are HIGHER than today's global price, so they can't break even. Not unless OPEC hikes.
Bolivars converted to $$ can't cover it.

8619 2018-11-15 09:15:03 A-lot of brands are getting called out about this Palm Oil thing

I think it's important but gosh it seems a bit too aggressive, some of the imagery is going way past "proving a point" and some of it's old posts as-well just shared now because the user is now on that train x

USA doesn't owe debts in Rubles nor Yuan nor Euros nor Bolivar nor Francs nor gold nor platinum. 
USA owes US Dollars *back* to acct holders that moved their $$ from Reserves to Securities accts.
Venezuela has unpaid debts (oil related) in FOREIGN money.  TOTALLY different.

8639 2018-11-15 09:13:01 ...its horrid stuff. Pour the NaOH into water, not the other way round, and stir it patiently to dissolve before adding it to the oil and cooking. And be damn sure to keep the oil stirring until the batch traces. If you want to wave a stick blender in it periodically, thats great
8640 2018-11-15 09:12:57 Shiz I would honestly have to go get the manual like it's a whole routine hahaha but cleanser and moisturiser, eye serum, vit c serum, vit b serum, Marula oil and glycolic acid (mixed with a few other acids) off the top of my head. I just like it bc no silicones!!!

8652 2018-11-15 09:11:03 Sorry, I realize this is old, but I feel compelled to assert this: the cartoon that depicted Standard Oil as an octopus with many subsidiary tentacles grasping the world predates and is much more well known than some obscure anti-semitic reference Hitler once made.

8676 2018-11-15 09:07:35 Hi, great piece. Question: How did rural villagers first learn about oil palm cultivation? I tried to access the full report by Bissonnette, but it's got paywall, rightfully so. Was wondering if I could get the answer from your replies? Cheers!

8743 2018-11-15 08:58:00 The U.S. oil market is scrambling to adjust to a deep selloff over the  last several weeks, with forward prices signaling a supply glut which  could upend plans for producers and traders through 2019.

8745 2018-11-15 08:57:36 I understand. But you didn't get me. Why would someone invest in asteroid mining when he knows his efforts would devalue his own end product. We have seen this problem with Shale oil.

8748 2018-11-15 08:57:06 And a crocodile pit, and makcaulin calkin home alone traps, and hot oil, and archers, no seriously, they walk through a thounsand miles of México but dont want to stop there? México is that bad? The USA should "Panama" México, the comunist mexican government is a total failure.
8749 2018-11-15 08:56:53 Or black and sticky oil...
8750 2018-11-15 08:56:23 In fairness, TW & many others have not been suggesting that at all. Oil is clearly there, but at these flow rates the market cap is simply ridiculous.
8751 2018-11-15 08:56:15 The reason why Scotland can't have a tailored deal is twofold.
1. England wants out.
2. Scotland has oil.

8754 2018-11-15 08:55:12 Where can a "Debt Problem" exist?  When any country owes debts based in FOREIGN currency.  Venezuela's export biz needs imported oil equip and chemicals, so debts owed in US Dollars, Euros, Yuan.  THAT is huge problem.
USA does not face that problem ... AT ALL.
8755 2018-11-15 08:55:07 Oil and gas price changes don't make any sense anymore. Despite the current metrics of supply being greater than demand,  prices dip and rise as if God is playing with our conscience.  Maybe conspiracy theorists maybe right.
8756 2018-11-15 08:54:57 I understand, but in football, 90% of the time, you don't worry about what comes next, you do something about the things that are wrong now. In a perfect world we'd go from MA to an oil state, but the world isn't perfect. Though ours will be without MA in it, that much we know.
8757 2018-11-15 08:54:06 Love the intention of no palm oil advert, but what we need is *sustainable* palm oil production. If other oils start getting used more, it just moves the problem elsewhere. (Unrealistic to ban all oils too, we’ve come too far!)
8758 2018-11-15 08:53:57 Gave up Nutella because of palm oil and now Tesco's own brand peanut butter. The bloody stuff is in so many products.

8780 2018-11-15 08:50:15 Well I disagree, because it's conceivable that even under Ashley we could compete in a system that's better structured, however unless we get the backing of an oil rich state we will never compete within the current structure. (Just to be clear I despise Ashley too).

8790 2018-11-15 08:48:07 @MarsGlobal @CadburyUK @NutellaGlobal you use palm oil to create your products. Can you confirm that your ingredients are sourced ethically? Will you be displaying the certification on your labels to give consumers confidence? #PalmOilFree #orangutans #deforestation
8791 2018-11-15 08:47:47 I make Molagapodi as its called in Kerala using only urud dal, hing, chilies, salt and garlic (optional). Just roast the ingredients and powder. I pour til oil over it all for enhancing the red color. I love using it over bread and butter. Idlis, dosas, Puriस and parathas...
8792 2018-11-15 08:47:40 I am sure some of the investments by the Norwegian Oil fund were unexpected and unpopular. Don’t they own property Paris and other places?

8794 2018-11-15 08:47:16 Is there an element of disciplining in this move; Irak announces production increases, US drillers pour in oil. Still the Saudi-russo pact holds the key to production volumes. How long will this exercise last after the OPEC meeting in December ?

8800 2018-11-15 08:46:05 Blur masking videos is a fine art and skill. It requires a lot of attention to detail. I was burning the midnight oil last night and it took a little over an hour for a single video. It was somewhat therapeutic though.

8816 2018-11-15 08:43:59 Well, I dunno. I just attended a forum on the topic at UWF. Indonesian Borneo & Sumatra are regarded as lost causes; Papua (a quasi-military state) and Sulawesi have the remaining forests. I can't see any likelihood of 'green' palm oil production in Papua - the ones I saw weren't

8818 2018-11-15 08:43:44 Hi, we ensure the palm oil we buy is produced on legally held land, does not lead to deforestation or loss of peat land, respects human rights and does not use forced or child labor. We continue to implement our Palm Oil Action Plan.  We achieved RSPO certification 3 years early.

8823 2018-11-15 08:43:02 Honest speech by the finance minister. 

Good measures - SSB tax, human resource development fund, health screening programmes

Less good measures - subsidies for processed sugar, palm oil and diesel fuel 

Finance / health policy coherence still critical.

8830 2018-11-15 08:41:57 Russia Cut Oil Output In First 2 Weeks Of Nov To 11.38M B/D: IFX
8831 2018-11-15 08:41:46 99.3 million barrels of oil a day are produced. Last year it was 97.3,99.2. the year before. New Zealand’s is 150k. If we sank into the ocean it wouldn’t drop below 99. It would be right back up within months if not weeks.
8832 2018-11-15 08:41:45 Sana oil!
8833 2018-11-15 08:41:26 Iceland use their Christmas advert to inform people of the devastation that Palm Oil production is having on the rain forest. John Lewis on the other hand telling us that if we don’t buy our kids a piano they’ll never equate to anything. Marvellous 
8834 2018-11-15 08:41:19 For fluffy roasties, par boil until the outside is starting to soften, drain and leave to steam for 5 minutes then shake gently with the lid on before adding to preheated oil. Cook for at least 45 minutes
8835 2018-11-15 08:41:17 Natgas has a much stiffer supply and demand curve than oil  and does not depend on the USD. Decline rates have here a much bigger impact.
8836 2018-11-15 08:41:15 I don’t know why you need a boycott to achieve that though? Greenpeace’s ad doesn’t call for one.  Other enviro groups don’t either. But Iceland’s campaign to spruke palm oil free Xmas tarts has half the UK jumping on the bandwagon which is silly and possibly harmful

& besides, our son & family live in Aberdeen ….
8858 2018-11-15 08:37:32 Again, I read this piece which was mostly good. In terms of oil palm though I’d rather take the word of veteran conservationists who’ve worked in Borneo for decades like @emeijaard over that of a Guardian columnist who’s probably never been to Asia.
8859 2018-11-15 08:37:26 Was thinking of the same Q... Also, it's helped many people to learn about the environmental damages from "dirty palm oil" and likely encourage them to choose  for "sustainable palm oil."  That's a good enough achievement, isn't it?

Industry was estimated to grow by 17.7% at the end of 2017, making it the best performing sector in terms of growth. This is largely due to an

8889 2018-11-15 08:33:55 Why do companies have to be so extra to use palm oil............ it’s just sum oil
8890 2018-11-15 08:33:54 What is the status on NZ's shift from carbon? Imagine pretty good? Though there's some oil off New Plymouth I seem to remember.

8900 2018-11-15 08:32:10 Well charge you more for oil  and gas you’ll need  not to mention we’ll return all the nuclear weapons you dumped in the Clyde yes we’ll miss being used as a dumping ground or test centre for immoral taxes
8901 2018-11-15 08:32:09 One of the transmission filters on the RT came apart at the seams. The placement of said filter is a masterpiece of modern engineering and required me to be a trainee contortionist to get at it.  New filter ,many litres of oil and back under way.

8908 2018-11-15 08:31:12 Ruble been rallying hard this week, despite weaker oil, after BB story suggested Congress go slow on more sanctions bills till next yr. Mkt wanting to price out sanctions risks. Perhaps that’s jumping gun. Big debate about whether sovereign sanctions next.

8912 2018-11-15 08:30:39 Certain plastics like PET can be very profitably recycled. There are already companies who can make sustainable PET plastic from used PET of similar quality and cheaper than PET made from crude oil. The tide is turning. We can already do it now. The technology and demand exist

8916 2018-11-15 08:30:02 My predictions on Pg&e 1) the government will bail them out. 2) they will divide it up n sell it off. 3) one of the big Texas oil companies will buy it for cents on the dollars as the stocks fall. This one is a Hail Mary.. @elonmusk buys the company
8917 2018-11-15 08:29:37 wash rinse and dry. toss in the oil of your choice, add salt and too much pepper. roast on 375 for a lot of minutes. (this isn't a recipe, but it works)
8918 2018-11-15 08:29:37 #JohnLewisChristmasAd It's ok. But just ok. No winners in the Xmas adverts this year. With hopefully one exception and that's the Orangutan population with the awareness raised on use of palm oil. #xmasads #IcelandAdvert
8919 2018-11-15 08:29:26 What a wank, Subaru’s are known shitboxes that consume so much oil there’s a class action against them in the US, and you’ve recommended them as good.
8920 2018-11-15 08:29:24 That’s good sentiment but the reality is the politicians who catalysed this mess (for party over country) have a case to answer. Analysts & business people have been consistently ignored by career politicians & snake oil salespeople. And we are now up a smelly creek sans paddles.
8921 2018-11-15 08:29:06 I am for anything that promotes the wide spread use of electric vehicles. Big Oil needs competition. We need to move to clean renewable energy economy ASAP!
8922 2018-11-15 08:28:58 “Our”?? You’re a political hanger-on, an electoral fraudstee and a professional sycophant, not a miner. A comfortable majority of the 17.4m would happily see you chained to an oil rig xx

8930 2018-11-15 08:27:53 Someone who studies how people slept in medieval times told me that we could really benefit from their approach- dim light before bed, time to wind down, little parcels made from dried rose petals etc. Modern equivalent: lavender oil, reading (not on phone). Proper darkness too!x
8931 2018-11-15 08:27:45 Details please... cooking is diamonds, gold and silver... natural gas and crude oil..... it's priceless
8932 2018-11-15 08:27:39 Do not fear. I have heard very good things about Stelara from other patients. There are loads of patients over on Instagram talking about their #stelara experiences. I also use CBD oil capsules by HempBombs; they have helped pain/inflammation a great deal.
8933 2018-11-15 08:27:38 come to think of it, Nigeria found oil 4 years before Dubai did, and look how far Dubai has left Nigeria behind.singapore,malaysia,started their economic reform less than 3 decades ago, the result is there for us to see.thats the benefit of choosing the right set of leader.
8934 2018-11-15 08:27:17 Hope Oil
8935 2018-11-15 08:27:11 Honesty in all dealings with all countries, a square deal for every American, break up the banks, Amazon & all the trusts, nationalize oil/pharma. Inherited wealth is dangerous and must be capped. Objective truth is back and we are gonna solve this shit.

8943 2018-11-15 08:25:12 Genuine question though: isn't the reason palm oil producers are looking at sustainable palm oil because people are boycotting?
8944 2018-11-15 08:25:08 More seriously though, what is the “blast” that you are enjoying. EVs have faster torque, responsive handling, smooth, no oil patches on drive, no smell, no scraping ICE in winter when late for work, erm enjoy the blast??!

8947 2018-11-15 08:24:35 I mean my understanding of the law around this at the moment is that TO's don't have any veto right over oil & gas development at all? But white farmers do? Is that something you think should be changed? Because I do.

8966 2018-11-15 08:20:33 The truth that somebody here is "dumn"? You still think I'm "dumn"? You don't seem very well informed. Or did you know what the writer of Trump's most famous book said about Trump and just didn't care? You seem like the type who loves snake oil salesmen.
8967 2018-11-15 08:20:26 you know how sometimes you use lotion instead of oil so your pants don’t stick to your skin? this decision is that but for my tongue.

The 2019 Budget should address the following;

1. How much have we paid with the 15 years payment levy?

2. What is the status of our oil refinery?
8985 2018-11-15 08:18:39 How about the one billion US dollars that was earlier mobilized by oil firms,particularly shell in readiness for the clean up. We pray the actual clean up starts and that due process has been followed in appointing the Contractors.

9010 2018-11-15 08:14:47 We see ads for so many things that have a negative effect on society yet ban an ad that informs on a real problems with palm oil/deforestation. It seems more like money is the driving force behind this ban and it's unacceptable.

9048 2018-11-15 08:09:52 We're in the position we're in because the old names of the Democratic party are just as in bed with banks, oil, and other interests as the Republican party.  Our only hope to make any meaningful change happen is to embrace new faces and eschew ones that can't let those funds go.
9049 2018-11-15 08:09:51 This is absolutely an important issue for us. Maintaining the RSPO guidelines and our Palm Oil Action Plan remains an utmost priority.
9050 2018-11-15 08:09:46 That's as inept as anything l have ever seen. When you generalise you end up looking stupid. Sanctions against Iran by the West will not stop  China buying Iran oil. Iran will always be in stronger position.  To dev quickly Zim needs FDI. FDI is affected by sanctions.

9074 2018-11-15 08:06:26 its not fish oil. It is a purified form of EPA. Fish oil contains EPA and DHA. Tell that to your momma or poppa or family member that goes to the cardiologist and gets prescribed vascepa :)
9075 2018-11-15 08:06:21 I think that the issue that has been addressed in that advert is too important to ignore now as palm oil has a bad effect on not only the environment but also on health.

9123 2018-11-15 07:59:02 This is good to see, and hopefully will increase demand for RSPO. However, Indian and Chinese consumers need to also be brought along otherwise (non-RSPO) palm oil will continue to expand into rainforest. UK & EU actors need to work with others (which many are) to solve problems.

d. All of the above

9232 2018-11-15 07:41:18 The North Sea oil so called "scandal" is debatable and has many sides of politics still arguing. There are numerous other tangible achievements accomplished by Thatcher. Her policies brought the UK out of a crippling recession. She also had many wins on the world stage.

9414 2018-11-15 07:12:22 People do not cure themselves with cannabis oil and special diets. Medicine can delay the inevitable but beating cancer is as much a matter of good luck than anything else. I’m alive today because I had a skilled surgeon and a resilient body, pure and simple.
9415 2018-11-15 07:12:19 Before the Norton wars, Chris had been trying hard to get the oil guys in but the cartel was manipulating all executive moves on the matter. So he was livid on that and then Norton funding of Temba made him blow over.

9426 2018-11-15 07:10:16 I recently learned a trick to add a drop of hydrating face oil to my foundation to make it more hydrating. It's been working really well for my combo, mostly dry, skin. I use Kat Von D which is pretty matte with great coverage. :)

9435 2018-11-15 07:08:26 also, early review: I tried the beauty bakerie wake & bake face oil today and even with my combo-oily prone skin it left me SO supple and radiant even hours later

will update after more prolonged use/with base products!
9436 2018-11-15 07:07:17 yeah, Israel gives the world technology that is used in the device from where ur typing ur message, and just because u have oil does not make u any less of a terrorist state
9437 2018-11-15 07:06:40 Nice to see Cadbury and Nestlé  called out over the Palm oil plantations. Won't hear about HSBC huge investment portfolio in Palm Oil though.
9438 2018-11-15 07:06:10 Hearing winter came early for Hy mkt... Esp US Hy where oil names are decent chunk of the space... Also hearing u can pick up crude in Canada for close to $16...

9440 2018-11-15 07:06:04 I am & also aware more people here are from areas that understand my usage. If you realised it too, you'd be aware that, shorn of your oil, the rest of the world would view you, your murdering prince, his demented family & your so called country as the biggest joke on earth.
9441 2018-11-15 07:05:52 Once the onions are a bit translucent, add your chopped chillies and stir until they are coated with the oil. Add the peri peri sachet into the mix and then stir again.

9444 2018-11-15 07:05:19 I’m gutted to discover that my go to hair product @AussieHair is NOT cruelty-free or Palm oil free. I’m disgusted that they disguise the use of Palm oil by using words such as Glyceryl Stearate.

9445 2018-11-15 07:05:17 It’s very clear . USA or GBR, are not after the Saudi government for what happened in Turky - Saudi embassy, while oil prices are coming down !??  The deal is place and what Mr Trum promised Americans - chip gas is happening - all other things - moral, not important
9446 2018-11-15 07:05:05 possibly a thing where older Priuses start burning through oil like whoa. I guess we'll find out.
9447 2018-11-15 07:05:04 Do you sell oil
9448 2018-11-15 07:04:44 縁故？
9449 2018-11-15 07:04:03 Put some oil in a small saucepan enough to cover the base and then add the sliced onions first. The key to the chilli is to keep the heat low and slow so I usually just put the stove plate on 2.
9450 2018-11-15 07:03:55 First defrost the turkey, second dont fill the pot with oil before putting the turkey in. No idea how people can screw this up...

9452 2018-11-15 07:03:43 Honestly, there's nothing bad about it.

9455 2018-11-15 07:03:08 Classic recipe, but I can't say as I approve of marinara as the only side. Consider adding some roughage to balance all those savory flavors, like olive oil on a bed of lightly tossed pubes, ripped out by the root. Presentation-wise, any leftover body parts make great garnishes!

9458 2018-11-15 07:02:38 Who does your oil economics, your oil company crones? Americans will be paying much higher prices for oil thanks to your Netanyahu guided policy on Iran.
9459 2018-11-15 07:02:25 You will need:

One small onion (sliced), 
One packet of green chillies (chopped seeds and all), 
One sachet of peri peri powder, 
Some Xtra hot Nandos peri peri sauce
And some vegetable oil
9460 2018-11-15 07:02:07 Eucalyptus trees burn like Roman candles.  The oil is very flammable.
9461 2018-11-15 07:01:33 /3 I sympathize with the fishermen but oil companies are only part of the problem. We all Have to recognize our own contribution to the problem. Rather than spending their money on a lawsuit they surely can not win.../4

9477 2018-11-15 06:58:22 @patriotact Great job Hasan. The oil episode was scary - we are killing the planet while looking the other way. Talk about getting away with murder.

9483 2018-11-15 06:57:47 At least cooking it in oven will take out the oil. But don’t leave it too long. It will get rubbery.

9831 2018-11-15 05:56:20 Try?  Try? . There is no Try....  Asian mama knows everything!  Good enough for Asian mama’s face, good enough for u!  Both baby wipes and olive oil. Lol. I’d try the olive oil first if u have it. Removes makeup and moisturizes yo face!
9832 2018-11-15 05:56:18 It is not always reasonable in USD. For instance, oil which we used to buy or USD 15 dollars. One would need 30$ USD how do you justify that.!
9833 2018-11-15 05:56:15 อะไรอ่ะ
9834 2018-11-15 05:56:07 Just don't use a super mattifying primer with the Fenty cause you don't wanna make your skin over produce on oil cause it'll feel dry. Rih Rih was serious when she said matte lmao

9843 2018-11-15 05:55:37 Many corps, including oil & gas, are aggressively developing and experimenting with alternative energies. None are practical on a large scale at the moment but hopefully soon they will be. In the meantime natural gas is a cleaner option and America has in abundance
9844 2018-11-15 05:55:33 BART-CalTrain expansion is the only realistic & practical solution to this, but good luck getting McConnell to pass an infrastructure bill, He's too busy bribing farmers in the midwest to ignore DTs trade war and giving billions in subsidies to the oil industry.

9859 2018-11-15 05:54:09 Maybe this will become the same argument used for the war in Iraq. That the oil there would pay for the cost of the war. I can imagine Prince using this same argument. That minerals will help fund private security forces. American taxpayers ended up footing the bill in Iraq.

9861 2018-11-15 05:53:47 Dear Sir,
Most of the premium products like veslim shake & capsule, flax oil, Detox Foot Patch, Aloevera, Noni, Glucosamine etc are being sold online at 35-40% discount.  And it is going for a long time, every time we ask our upline raining this issue, but no reply we got.
9862 2018-11-15 05:53:42 Was reading a cookbook. Unsure about this, but did you known that originally, olives were banned from being planted in New Spain to protect farmers in Spain from competition? It wasn’t until the Church got involved - olive oil needed for sacraments - that Spain relented.
9863 2018-11-15 05:53:21 Hilarious
9864 2018-11-15 05:53:09 You think climate change is unrelated to oil and gas industry propaganda?
9865 2018-11-15 05:52:29 Rojava  is the creation of the US ,Saudis Gulf States And Israel. Regime Change using ISIS & Al Qaeda. Before Civil War only 2 million out of 35 million Syrians were Kurdish . Rojave is half the country & Oil resources. Very disappointed in Ken Loach .
9866 2018-11-15 05:52:26 They are either bailing out states,  paying Biafran soldiers pension, buying grass, doing oil exploration in sambisa, releasing and paying terrorists, tradermoni, feeding zakzaky and everything that the citizens dont care about.

9873 2018-11-15 05:51:30 Also people saying marijuana need to do their research. THC increases anxiety. However, CBD oil does not have physcoactive properties so it can help. Use the oil!

9899 2018-11-15 05:47:21 Never buy HEB’s olive oil that says “intense fruity flavor” because it’s actually quickly pressed bitterness instead of the light, subtle, and majestic flavor of properly cold pressed olive oil. That was truly one of the worst things I ever put in my mouth.

9971 2018-11-15 05:35:55 put tea tree oil on your face at night& day. it got my skin to clear up so much and I started seeing results instantly
after use. idk why but it WORKS
9972 2018-11-15 05:35:54 @realDonaldTrump I've come to change my mind. Let's welcome the caravan/invasion at the border, intercept them. Then move them into western Texas and have them settle on BLm lands. Give them help(the army)resources to build. Give food beans, rice oil, greens. 1/2
9973 2018-11-15 05:35:50 Pag mabawi ng Pinas ang Sabah, angbkita sa oil ay sapat na to fund entire PHGovt.
9974 2018-11-15 05:35:19 Yes. I don't disagree. But the equities, the oil companies can do very well at 50 bl. It's tricky.
9975 2018-11-15 05:35:17 You haven’t tried it baked with oil....it’s great actually
9976 2018-11-15 05:35:12 @soniaossorio How about Senator Gillibrand handing over her campaign contributions she took in the past from fracking, oil, nuclear, Wall Street Banks and Sallie Mae PAC....you'll likely never respond Sonia because it's 'complicated' politically isn't it?
9977 2018-11-15 05:34:56 We dont have enough of them yet to change to all renewable. Once we do that, we can stop using oil altogether.
9978 2018-11-15 05:34:34 Thanks to price formula which reflects oil price
9979 2018-11-15 05:34:27 Stop drilling for oil! I’m sure you as a company must be top bidders for the Amazonian contracts now from Brazil’s new dictator ? Have some shame!
9980 2018-11-15 05:34:03 CBD oil is good. You should try it
9981 2018-11-15 05:33:59 And stop with that nonsense of our dependence on Oil, you realize that the OPEC controls the oil market and it’s not because of Drumpf right? Why is he allowing the Saudis to go famous with destroying Yemen and Qatar?
9982 2018-11-15 05:33:57 Let's see:
* Save our democracy from the GOP
* Save our planet for our kids
* Keep the air breathable
* Keep our energy industry moving forward instead of keeping it stuck in the past to benefit Big Oil

I'd say that's not nothing.

9985 2018-11-15 05:33:18 Homie would put on the Boyz II Men, light some candles and break out the sensual oil like “baby you’ve had a hard day, let me take care of you now”
9986 2018-11-15 05:32:58 @POTUS Hopefully crude oil will be avg.$55.00 a barrel within weeks & until Spring 2019 #OPEC
9987 2018-11-15 05:32:42 The digital space of most #HRDS reporting the violation of human  right on the oil and gas activities in Albertine grabben is expected to be narrowed down due to fear of  threat, hackers, intimidation, attack, arrest etc. @Ngethamedia1

9993 2018-11-15 05:31:47 It's the oil industry ending or having a livable planet. You're choosing the former, our PM is showing leadership and cares more about that latter. Thanks.
9994 2018-11-15 05:31:43 I just smelled oil paint for the first time in 5 years. If you know the smell, you know I'm gonna be in a nostalgic creative hole for like 48 hours.

9996 2018-11-15 05:30:57 @NancyPelosi Break the stranglehold that Big Oil, Coal, and Gas have over our democracy by saying no to fossil fuel money, and make big polluters pay for their climate deception and inaction.
9997 2018-11-15 05:30:46 How can ANY oil company make money with oil at 15.75 ?? This guy needs to shut production today.
9998 2018-11-15 05:30:45 Oil
9999 2018-11-15 05:30:37 I saw that. It does look like the front lost grip momentarily. Maybe oil or stones. I came off on some tiny stones once. His line was different from the others.  Maybe dirty side of the road. Hope hd makes a full recovery
10000 2018-11-15 05:30:37 We need to get jobs for Canadians and the best way to do that is by using our resources.  We’re not that stupid to take loans for research when we’ve got black gold.  Our debt is what, $2T with one of the biggest oil reserves and pop of only ~36mil

10003 2018-11-15 05:30:16 When we have both Houses absolutely, but we cant just jerk the wheel to the Left and expect the country to roll with us.

We turn this thing like an oil tanker, slowly.
10004 2018-11-15 05:29:46 Who is this supposed firefighter? The heat expands the metal, which causes the bridge to buckle in it's mounts. Basic science. Asphalt is just oil soaked sand in essence, so it's flammable.
