43 2018-10-02 21:38:42 True. We are also in a more vulnerable position when it comes to perishability and lack of processors to market to. Which is why different systems work for different commodities.
44 2018-10-02 21:35:33 But but Gibbs, this was forthcoming, as early as dec. 2017. Maduro and Víctor Cano stated then Petro certificates would be issued backed by other commodities, which would also help curb illegal mining of those. The gov has already paid some imports using petros, i.e. for CLAPs.

a general increase in prices and fall in the purchasing value of money.

82 2018-10-02 19:07:44 As a response to intellectual property theft, this could have been a much more targeted approach than commodities tariffs.  It wouldn't have negatively impacted such a large swath of the economy and would have hindered their Made in China policy that IP theft supports.
83 2018-10-02 18:56:49 I’m a huge fan of the film (wasn’t especially aware of the posters before now). An amazing piece of work on relations between gender, commodities (that silver cup) and pleasure (‘wouldst thou like to live deliciously?’). I love it.

120 2018-10-02 17:36:20 But that gets a much more difficult discussion on how their industry subsidization works - and where we need to go to get anywhere closer to Lighthizer getting on board

It's easy to fudge the deficit figure by shifting to buy us commodities, but Lighthizer rejects that
121 2018-10-02 17:36:02 I think this is one more step in a cringeworthy direction, which is to turn babies and children into commodities.

So no, I do not think manipulating genetic characteristics to suit parents' aesthetics or even prejudiced requirements is the ethical way forward.

125 2018-10-02 17:29:06 Its placing animals into boxes and compartmentalising. We learn from an early age that the cat & dog are pets to care for, yet farm animals are to be managed for our use. We treat them as commodities, instead of sentient beings. We need to change mentality and human psyche.
126 2018-10-02 17:26:19 Wouldnt be surprised to see it fade the entire move.. This market is not real..  Just look at how many banks, traders have been caught spoofing commodities.. They pay a small fine and do it all over again.. Its just absurd.. and @CFTC is complicit in all of it..
127 2018-10-02 17:20:44 You're absolutely wrong. It's the patriarchal, misogynistic, oppressive rape culture of men, who objectify us women as sexual commodities and who exploit our (house and children) work to allow them to grow their wealth.

133 2018-10-02 17:00:49 @CBCOntarioToday Michael your last caller had it correct. I remember in @YourAlberta when the meat industry put up their prices 25% overnight... These farmers have it so tough...having to pay feed prices and market shares drop on commodities and cost is passed on to you and I
134 2018-10-02 17:00:31 Nations should have the right to determine cost of commodities based on the nation its being sent to.
135 2018-10-02 16:56:45 Sim, mas entre outros fatores. O Real tornou a moeda estável, o que é essencial. Mas depois tivemos a venda dos commodities pra China, e a venda dos royalties do petróleo.

141 2018-10-02 16:22:44 Volume of commodities marketed by ag co-ops was almost $120 billion in 2017, farm supplies sold was $82 billion, both up from 2016. Net income was down from 2016, but still a strong $6.2 billion in 2017.
142 2018-10-02 16:15:37 A very good piece of information. As you rightly pointed out, we are in a bearish phase wrt the small and mid caps, and bullish correction wrt the Nifty. And some resemblance of 2011-13 is seen. IT, Pharma, Metal, Energy and Commodities look good for short to mid term.
143 2018-10-02 16:15:03 While it was going to be good had it only been introduced to mines it's a terrible idea for the average citizen because all other businesses will not get a refund from ZRA so to cover up that cost prices of commodities will have to go up
144 2018-10-02 16:11:39 My confidence is not unfounded. It’s the people at the top letting me know. October and November are going to be interesting. Remember, they can’t let the inflation hit the commodities. What has happened to the oil price last 2 weeks? Remember, crypto=sponge 4 dollar inflation
145 2018-10-02 16:10:04 For all those complaining, this is only the beginning. Just in case you didn’t know, Govt abolished VAT which was at 16% & introduced Sales Tax which stands at 20%. This means the price of ALL commodities is about to go through the roof as well. We’re doomed if we remain silent.
146 2018-10-02 16:09:21 People, they are going to rig it until investors loose confidence. NO ONE knows what level that will be, but, as so many legendary investors have said, this will continue until it doesn't. Investors will loose confidence in the mkts and pile into hard assets/commodities. Patience

229 2018-10-02 11:44:50 My major pain is this is an increase over and above other increases on basic commodities.  I also am forced to process several RTGS transactions because there is a shortage of cash.  I would have been holding my cash and not incur these tax charges.
230 2018-10-02 11:39:57 Si nos basamos en el optimismo rampante del gobierno de que el valor de las commodities no va a caer , pero hay información de que si, yo me pregunto, ¿ Si cae y la entrada de dólares es menor, que excusa van a decir ?

233 2018-10-02 11:07:43 I think they’ve changed the formula to now have it pegged to a basket of commodities (not solely oil) including Gold & Iron Ore. Perhaps the Petro is more of a 1923 Rentenmark as opposed to a Helfferich rye currency (that wasn’t pursued) which was actually redeemable in Marks.
234 2018-10-02 11:06:02 Your tax money is paying for those title deeds,RDP housing,cANCer officials houses,parties,land & aunties & cousins wedding gifts.Why would the most easy of taxable commodities that will be paid for regardless of how high the price is,be lowered JUST to suit someones pocket?

237 2018-10-02 10:52:51 While I agree that prices of commodities should be reduced to be affordable, both national & county governments shouldn't dictate prices without fixing factors that determine prices. Its hypocrisy to add taxes and electricity and dictate to traders to reduce prices. This is PR.

239 2018-10-02 10:49:50 Yes! An insult to all Filipino consumers that are being affected by that 6.8 high inflation rate on basic commodities! No empathy, sir.

276 2018-10-02 08:35:25 Thanks. As an Iranian, I should say this is correct. But don't forget that prices are always underreported in Iran. So if u come here, u ll see that the actual inflation is much higher for certain commodities.
277 2018-10-02 08:30:25 But even e.g. the commodities markets have strict specifications. You are going to get standardisation one way or another, it's just who sets the standards.
278 2018-10-02 08:24:59 On 3, it's not a bad idea to give pple real value. It is the responsibility of institutions to ensure that they also get the equivalent in work output. Humans are commodities whch must b valued fairly. Remember we're in a #Multicurrency regime.

285 2018-10-02 07:25:16 agree, more of a punt. 
the counter-trend argument is a combo of NAFTA (done), RBA vs BoC futures and Oil vs Commodities. Ambiguity on the last is probably the trap
v. difficult to structure a spot trade, a 1% OTMF 3m call (38D), for example, would cost <1% (~6.4% vol)

345 2018-10-02 01:56:57 A beta versus largecap US equity (what the S&P 500 is) of less than one could reflect the rest of the portfolio being invested in any one of a number of ways. Nothing daft in principle about investing in Treasury bills, notes, or bonds, or investing in commodities.
346 2018-10-02 01:56:12 If BJP wants to win 2019. Bring all commodities including Petrol/ Diesel in GST.
SC & ST Act is required to be reviewed and it should be only for poor people i.e. on economic background. 
Else I am sure you will loose 2019 elections.

352 2018-10-02 01:38:49 Worker welfare is becoming part of the equation when farms get audited, it is going to force higher prices to be paid for commodities, this will raise food prices some.  This is where things get sticky with consumers...a lot of wants but they still talk with their wallet
353 2018-10-02 01:32:33 @BJP4India if you do not do any thing to stop fuel price raise it is not maha gathbandhan which will deafeat you it is common man who is boiling against your apathy to attend fuel price raise. Price raise of all commodities are high due to high fuel prices.jago BJP, Amitshaw
354 2018-10-02 01:32:26 @DesdeElLlanoJMS ya hartan con el modelo de país. Que más hay que decir a parte  de querer vivir en democracia, insertados en el mundo, un mercado global que permite producir más allá de los simples  commodities, vivir en paz, un estado fuerte en educación, justicia y salud.
355 2018-10-02 01:31:15 El precio del Petro resultará del valor de venta en los mercados internacionales de la canasta de Commodities que lo respaldará: Precio de la cesta venezolana de Petróleo (50%), la onza de oro (20%), la tonelada métrica de hierro (20%) y el quilate de diamante (10%) todos en USD.
356 2018-10-02 01:31:13 as far as i can tell its saying that capitals alienation of labor to a commodity results in a refined commodity for the capitalist that they can then sell for more money and buy more commodities which further alienates labor to refine more and start the process again
357 2018-10-02 01:28:39 It’s just I feel the Native Americans pain. I see what they’ve been through since anglos have come to the America’s. I’m aware of the genocides and diseases, and the way they are treated like disposable commodities. I genuinely feel for them. Yes, and I’m a bit too passionate.
358 2018-10-02 01:09:59 I'm not even a strict constructionist, but I do believe in jurisdiction. Jurisdiction is kinda like pregnancy, you cannot be half pregnant. You also cannot tell the world what your jurisdiction is once it's defined by statute. If @CFTC jurisdiction over commodities is statutory.
359 2018-10-02 01:08:25 Beats are like commodities, when you dont have any you miss them
360 2018-10-02 01:06:20 The more you consume, the less you live. Commodities are the opium of the people.

362 2018-10-02 00:58:05 While we out here doing the #KupeDance, a quick reminder that just as it's not okay to take a picture of ladies and ask men to pick one.

It's still the same belittling humans to commodities when you hashtag #LadiesPickOne

364 2018-10-02 00:54:34 Zim economy and politics is literally like playing monopoly game, fake money, fake president, fake assets and commodities
365 2018-10-02 00:51:50 "Disse que vota em quem o Lyla mandar, porque tinha anos que não passava fome"

Cara, como você vai argumentar com isso? Racionalmente? Falar de mercado internacional? De crise de commodities? De tretas partidárias? Não tem como.
366 2018-10-02 00:45:28 Peace could never be overrated. It's one of the dearest commodities in life.
367 2018-10-02 00:43:07 Could it be due to the types of biz in EM - e.g. manufacturing and commodities? Higher manufacturing = more employment and growing GDP per capita, but doesn't necessarily mean the businesses themselves earn an attractive return on capital in the long run?
368 2018-10-02 00:42:40 Not by Denmark. For 45 yrs their organising principle has essentially been 'least carbon fuel cost'. ie for any given use of energy as a service (heat/cooling, power, mobility etc) they have minimised their consumption of oil & gas as commodities

371 2018-10-02 00:34:49 .@POLITICOPro’s @liz_crampton reported “@US_FDA testing of glyphosate residues in food found no detectable amounts of the herbicide in over half of commodities tested and minimal amounts in corn and soybean samples.”
372 2018-10-02 00:28:29 #Petro | ¿Novedades?
- Será respaldado en petróleo (50%), oro (20%), hierro (20%), diamantes (10%)
- El costo de su 1era emisión estará referenciado en el valor de estos commodities en el mercado internacional
- Posee un nuevo sistema de ahorro denominado "Stakin"
373 2018-10-02 00:26:52 Not sure how renaming NAFTA and changing it a bit blows tariffs argument out - tariffs are taxes under another name - commodities are up because of speculation China PMI was under 50 - unexpected consequences are the concern
374 2018-10-02 00:21:31 Prices for agriculture commodities rallied today following news of the trade deal between the U.S., Canada and Mexico, providing a brief distraction from expectations for a bumper harvest that recently sent prices lower.
375 2018-10-02 00:20:35 I'm just long oil...oh & soft commodities :(
376 2018-10-02 00:15:47 Toda atitude honesta é uma expressão da arte. Não existe arte sem emanação, concentração e projeção. Tudo longe disso é commodities - não tem valor.

377 2018-10-02 00:11:49 Depende de la política de cada país, x ej en USA si hay petróleo en tu propiedad sos el dueño, de ahí los millonarios texanos, en Arg solo te pagan un canon. El precio de los commodities es el USD, al igual q la soja o te pensas que cuando compras gas a Rusia se lo pagas en AR$?
378 2018-10-02 00:10:07 @pgker Hi Peter good article today on commodities  check out AJM at Pilgangoora,
also ready to ship Lithium.
379 2018-10-02 00:04:03 “Una moneda no deja de ser fiduciaria por obedecer un commodity basket price rule. Si no puedes redimir la moneda por los commodities que componen la cesta, su valor sigue dependiendo de la confianza."

Y nadie confía en el chavismo.
....and period!!
