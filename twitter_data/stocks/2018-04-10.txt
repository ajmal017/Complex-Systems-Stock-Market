111 2018-04-10 22:41:51 Oil is going higher for multiple reasons imho, incl #Syria. 70s, 80s until crash later this year takes it down. Precious Metals and the Dollar likely to benefit too - safe havens. But stocks are the risk asset that will likely get hit imo.

117 2018-04-10 22:36:30 My guess is that you're rebalancing back towards "the market" portfolio. Eg, if the global market portfolio is 45/55 stocks/bonds on avg then rebalancing will usually bring you back into some equilibrium that reduces your exposure to the outsized risk in equities.

123 2018-04-10 22:31:43 I wandered into a discussion accidentally today and commented that I’d watched the ex UK Ambassador to Syria being interviewed, saying that HE thought it might have been the rebels, there were stocks of chemicals found in Aleppo.

141 2018-04-10 22:18:36 Speaking for myself, I’m trying to pick the best stocks (according to my plan) as much today as I was 12 months ago. If in doubt, remember that it’s always a good idea to always be looking for the best stocks... ALWAYS.
142 2018-04-10 22:18:10 Never if you invest in gold stocks.
143 2018-04-10 22:17:08 If you’re smart, you’ll invest in baby wipe stocks. #tipsfromanAKdogowner #breakupseason #alltheslush
144 2018-04-10 22:17:04 Lol I can be short or long and am not day trader.I like Faris a ton and respect him, here’s what I know: when boat loaded in 1 direction be wary.Currently, rightly or wrongly boat loaded long $VIX  it’s been the right call BUT the VIX gains will b captured=stocks will RIp. #Facts
145 2018-04-10 22:16:51 #Facebook #Zuckerberg hearing is an interesting watch indeed. As I mentioned earlier, $FB is too hot to touch. Long time longs are dissatisfied & short time shorts are quite squeezed. #stocks #trading #markets $DJI $SPX $AAPL $MU $BA $GM $NFLX $GOOGL $AMZN $C $MS $BAC
146 2018-04-10 22:16:07 It's very David Fincher, very Aaron Sorkin, very Jesse Eisenberg, and very Trent Reznor, and none of those stocks have risen since 2010.
147 2018-04-10 22:15:27 Nobody cares about gold stocks. Almost zero institutional interest. Everyone hooked on FANG et al.  Trends change.  Just like 2000.
148 2018-04-10 22:15:11 this matches stocks:asia eu tend to stay flat to up, while most negativity came from the US (quiet frequent occurrence last 3 weeks)

150 2018-04-10 22:14:02 There was a girl behind me today in the pharmacy with at least 20 bags of mini eggs. I'm so glad I'm not the only one that stocks up on them!
151 2018-04-10 22:13:42 Good observations Tony. We always take FTDs seriously. Not all FTDs work but no bull market has ever started without a FTD. If this rally is going to work, then over the next month we will see more leading stocks break out of bases.
152 2018-04-10 22:13:33 God says that He will send Sharks to buy up stocks for Murdock and Sons LLC and Fox News Conglomerates!  They will be chopped up. So will Facebook if they don't stop helping GOP getting voted for thru Subliminal messaging Ads and commercials.Wall Street will crashing alot.

155 2018-04-10 22:10:04 Using congressional currency  greased & lubed, vasoline stocks jumped!
156 2018-04-10 22:09:56 Comrades, I only do bull: April 11 2017 $1,220  April 11 2018 $6,860  = 5.6x  That's yearly bullish in my book. How did your stocks go?
157 2018-04-10 22:09:46 I do not know. Probably while stocks last.
158 2018-04-10 22:09:24 Bump stocks ban also passes judiciary committee 12-0 with 2 not voting. Republican Reps Filippi and Price didn’t vote because they wanted more time to review changes to bills
159 2018-04-10 22:08:33 Oh how about the 600+ rounds fired due to bump stocks only one pull of trigger but many many shots, but let’s leave that alone and do what?
160 2018-04-10 22:08:28 If that’s not your goal, don’t worry about what type of market it is because you shouldn’t be trading stocks, just stick with a major index ETF or buy gold. 
161 2018-04-10 22:07:54 Whether the market is trending up, down, or sideways, isn’t it ALWAYS a traders goal to buy stocks that will outperform?
162 2018-04-10 22:07:31 I am not a promoter I am not a professional writer as u can tell . I am not trying to be someone who I am not . I just type and send . I study stocks and always post when I am buying.  Even though at most times I get front ran . . But it's who I am . So I get what u read 
163 2018-04-10 22:06:31 "Nothing happened after Parliament voted not to strike Assad's CW capability" says Lord Falconer. We did exactly the right thing - we found some non-kinetic levers that persuaded #Putin to force #Assad to give up his declared CW stocks.

164 2018-04-10 22:06:22 Why do you think he cashed out all those stocks in his own company?
... because he needs to give a lot of congressmen and women hush money.
165 2018-04-10 22:06:15 The “red flag” bill passed the judiciary committee 12-0 with 2 members not voting. Bump stocks ban up next.

167 2018-04-10 22:05:39 I hear a lot of chatter about the type of market we’re in. If you trade stocks, I would argue that any type of market is a “stock pickers” market.

169 2018-04-10 22:02:40 Awesome video! I had no idea NASDAQ® led 4 major indices higher by rallying over 2%, much of it likely due to the big price move higher by Facebook. Energy stocks led the market from a sector perspective today! Love your trade idea to Buy an In-The-Money diagonal spread on $HAL

175 2018-04-10 21:59:22 They will outlaw bump stocks bc they are ignorant and stupid.  I can use my belt, maybe they should outlaw belts?
176 2018-04-10 21:59:18 general storage area, a dining hall, sleeping quarters, a place for your quartermaster(a table) so he can tally your stocks, farms, workshops for wood and stone. That might be the bear minimum besides maybe a trading post.
177 2018-04-10 21:58:21 Brent Oil Spot looks pretty good - the key Resistance is $71.285 - if breaks out that's very bullish and obviously positive for Oil Stocks.
178 2018-04-10 21:58:13 That’s really not saying much considering that SPX DJI and COMPX have been making 1% moves every day like its the norm. That China news should’ve sent stocks like this soaring not staggering.
179 2018-04-10 21:57:30 By those metrics stocks and dollars don't produce value since their job is purely to store and transfer value. I'm with you, bitcoin isn't valuable it's valueless lol
180 2018-04-10 21:56:47 10/04/18: As Mark Zuckerberg confidently face U.S lawmakers and provide answers to their questions, Facebook stocks closed high at 4%. Investors are obviously happy with the answers the Facebook Founder/CEO gave Senate!
181 2018-04-10 21:55:23 Win May canola down A$4.21/t & EU rape us down A$4.89. A$ stronger against both C$ & euro. Futures weaker with follow through selling from Monday & stronger C$ vs US$. Global soybn stocks down with smaller Argentine crop.
182 2018-04-10 21:53:57 It’s a bottom. How and why? Because I sold some of my stocks today and yesterday.  Have 30% cash and feel I’m under invested. I always sell too soon banking on another flush down
183 2018-04-10 21:51:08 Also, with a voting age at 18, you’re probably losing some young voters on this issue. I think there are lot more important issues with guns than moving from 18-21. Background checks, bump stocks, assault weapons, etc.
184 2018-04-10 21:50:35 Win May canola down A$4.21/t & EU rape us down A$4.89. A$ stronger against both C$ & euro. Futures weaker with follow through selling from Monday & stronger C$ vs US$. Global soybn stocks down with smaller Argentine crop.

186 2018-04-10 21:50:00 The 49.5 point (+1.9%) rally seen in S&P Futures so far this week marks the strongest start to a week in the 74 weeks since Tuesday 8 November 2016 #stocks
187 2018-04-10 21:49:37 Well.. it looks like his stocks just rebounded 
188 2018-04-10 21:49:02 Hi Gill - hope you're well. We think the fact that fish farms are still spreading disease and infecting wild salmon stocks is getting old. Time to make some changes.
189 2018-04-10 21:48:16 What other factors?

I'm just commenting that the sentiment surrounding BTC is speculative. Whether or not it may be a store of value someday, at present most of those who hold it are speculators. When a recession comes around, I can't see $ rushing out of stocks into BTC.
190 2018-04-10 21:47:39 I think he is just upset that everyone uses his words of wisdom / advice when they talk about holding garbage stocks and having patience and all of that..

194 2018-04-10 21:45:41 I guess only time will tell who’s predicting the truth but I’m telling you that gun control and the ban of AK47’s, AR15’s and Bump Stocks will be put into law because it’s what the MAJORITY of Americans want. We’re not giving up until it’s done.

205 2018-04-10 21:39:24 I'd have to argue that. They're being bludgeoned for their meat. The skins are just a by product of the hunt. Nothing is wasted. Btw, what is the viewpoint PETA has on the cod and caplin stocks being destroyed by an overabundance of seals? Seals don't order out for pizza!!
206 2018-04-10 21:38:06 Stocks in support of #Zuckerberg today. It is not uhuru yet for Zuck though. He lives to fight another day but one thing is clear world wide regulation of online content and use is imminent. It is not if but when.

212 2018-04-10 21:35:08 Should have invested more yesterday. Because the few stocks I have now hit an all-time high

214 2018-04-10 21:34:47 because we don't offer stock levels as a service, I don't have automated data publishing.
But i can manually produce them . The levels on stocks are useful only if they are trending. But if they do trend, Level H. H2 and Low Low 2 are extremely useful
215 2018-04-10 21:34:11 If not...buy guns stocks...sales are going up cause of @davidhogg111

239 2018-04-10 21:19:10 Don't want a gun ban.  Wouldn't mind bump stocks being banned and some additional requirements on AR 15s.  The shooting problem isn't all about guns.  We need to look at the research and find numerous ways to mitigate the risks of mass shootings. It's a society problem.

251 2018-04-10 21:12:16 Sadly it is. Plenty of dead bodies from the bombing. Plenty of human shield hostages for that matter. Bit of acting. Maybe kill a few hostages with your own stocks of Chlorine gas. This isn't the first accusation. Most of them get ignored by the West.

253 2018-04-10 21:11:44 Since stocks will need to get liquidated if bonds are ever in trouble, seems reasonable that stocks are hypersensitive to news.

255 2018-04-10 21:10:02 these types of setups almost always lead to a sell off. product reveals, conference calls, interviews etc.
256 2018-04-10 21:09:54 You are definitely welcome. These kids aren't trying to take your guns. They're trying to get universal background checks, ban bump stocks. I'm sure we can all agree on at least those two things. Or if not we can talk about were we disagree and how to come to a consensus.

Hungrybox always manages to get a grab and rest them or jab reset into rest

301 2018-04-10 20:53:45 The corps using the Tax Cut to buy back stocks to inflate their stock option prices and the Treasury buying massive amounts of stock are the only reason the Stock Market hasn't crashed. Eventually the money is going to run out.

405 2018-04-10 20:06:38 Stocks rose & did not fall. The Dow closed at 24,408.00, up 428.90 (+1.79%). Nasdaq +2.07%. S&P +1.67%.
406 2018-04-10 20:06:08 I failed at buying stocks. How have I managed to fail at every career ever made?

410 2018-04-10 20:05:20 We need to ban knife bump stocks. No one needs to be able to do faster stabbings.
411 2018-04-10 20:05:02 @Desdemona4U where do you see junior mining stocks on ASX going in 2018?
412 2018-04-10 20:04:49 1st Amendment allows for freedom of speech. It's not illegal to voice an opinion on a stock. Upgrades & downgrades by GS, JPM, or hedge funds could be construed as attempts to 'pump or deflate' stocks. All stocks carry unforeseen risks. Position size & stops help mitigated risk.
413 2018-04-10 20:04:47 I'll have you know that, as a freelancer, I always bring a mug with me to every job I go to. I'm just doing my bit. I also bring in my own tea (usually PG Tips, Barry's, or Lyons). What the hell is going on that EVERY company in NYC stocks Lipton "tea" in their office kitchens?
414 2018-04-10 20:04:45 Stocks are temporal. Pay little attention to that for now.
415 2018-04-10 20:04:11 Nasdaq, S&P record O'Neil follow-through days, though volume < average volume #stocks
416 2018-04-10 20:03:37 Yes they do! And thank you! Every time you libs talk about gun control my stocks go up! Keep up the good work
417 2018-04-10 20:03:26 Are you sure, #Zuckerberg's #Facebook #stocks are still worth $62Billion by now? #Facebookgate #CambridgeAnalytica #TrumpRussia
418 2018-04-10 20:03:09 $POLA nice close today...watching it over 5.40s area imo.
419 2018-04-10 20:02:59 If my stocks are making money for me I'm happy.
Your a dip shit.
420 2018-04-10 20:02:33 Tbh it seems the #powerhour is turning to the sell off hour.. in most stocks... things should be changing but damn day by day it’s what going to be like...
421 2018-04-10 20:01:32 So Facebook stocks up after Zuckerberg sidesteps the “who’s your biggest competitor” question.
422 2018-04-10 20:01:25 $IDXG 0.94s nice coming off the bottom. Watching for 1.10s break imo . Real b/o imo
423 2018-04-10 20:01:02 S&P should be done chopping.  Plenty of consolidation past 2 months.  It will need to start new upward trajectory and break declining trend line over next 2-4 weeks.  Otherwise we can begin considering a summer bear market.   $Spy $QQQ #stocks
424 2018-04-10 20:00:27 Well, you’ve been a great salesman for guns and the NRA. Looks like you’re helping out gun stocks now. Bravo young man.
425 2018-04-10 19:59:27 Thta's the same concern many have over Syria. When Dems and Republicans alike are eager to go to war, the citizenry should be VERY worried. (But @BillKristol is counting on his war stocks paying big dividends...)
426 2018-04-10 19:59:20 He was pretty confident, even the stocks went up
427 2018-04-10 19:59:15 Post-USDA report, #Soybeans closed higher. Corn & Wheat lower.  Livestock mixed. US stocks, Crude, #copper & cotton all higher after positive speech from #China President. US Dollar lower today.
428 2018-04-10 19:58:40 If it weren’t for dopes like me who would sell you the stocks you’ll make money on bro?
429 2018-04-10 19:58:36 buy baby stocks
430 2018-04-10 19:58:25 At Franklin Regional High, 20 plus students were stabbed by a student. No bump stock for that knife you talk about. 2nd, bump stocks are inaccurate & useless, but u wouldnt know that because guns are jargon to you. You believe everything u hear on tell-lie-vision dont ya?
431 2018-04-10 19:57:24 Real question: What is a solid way to do that? Is buying etfs/stocks the best way?
432 2018-04-10 19:57:06 It would make sense that him getting in the HOF is part of a sross promotion, I don't know if Jerrett still has stocks though.
433 2018-04-10 19:56:25 Yet you’re silent on “defense contractor” stocks (actually offense but another topic).

Your FBI daddy wouldn’t like that would he.

Companies sell guns to citizens for defense and that’s bad... sell guns to tyrannical governments murdering civilians and I only hear crickets...
434 2018-04-10 19:56:13 Russian stocks hit hard by US sanctions. Absolute brilliant work Resident trump. Americans should thank you for your business commonsense and strong will. None of this would have been done under incompetent and uncaring Democrats.
435 2018-04-10 19:56:09 Thanks for sharing this tool, David. I'll be re-investing my entire retirement portfolio to divest from all gun/ammo stocks. #NeverAgain
436 2018-04-10 19:55:45 Doesn't making bump stocks legal defeat the purpose of making fully automatic rifles illegal...?
437 2018-04-10 19:55:14 You haven't packed your crap and left yet huh hurry up your planes leaving buddy I just bought a crap load of stock in the gun stocks I'm making millions off of it it's awesome thanks to you thank you thank you
438 2018-04-10 19:54:57 The goal is to manipulate the stocks but it rarely succeeds. Kind of like my dog chasing squirrels. The goal is to eat it. He has only succeeded once. Market is too big to be easily manipulated.
439 2018-04-10 19:54:34 Why are they showing Facebook stocks - having Zuckerberg's heart rate would be far more interesting.
440 2018-04-10 19:54:31 Senate Hearing on facebook: “If we let you off, will you censor people more?”
“Deal!” 
P.S. senators with investments, stocks and money from facebook is fine
441 2018-04-10 19:54:28 i ran out of stocks nak. mamaya pa mag buy :--( thank u though 
442 2018-04-10 19:54:21 1st day in a while that I see a good list of stocks with increase above avg volume n moving up.
443 2018-04-10 19:54:20 Normally when they say so means boring stocks with low PE underperformed stocks with high PE. When somebody thinks FB may be trading below intrinsec value and they buy it, regardless of the trend, in which bucket do they fall?
444 2018-04-10 19:53:30 Great idea! Hold'em by the stocks - and crush.

446 2018-04-10 19:53:06 Yeah idk if sharebuilder exists anymore, I feel like I read something recently that it got acquired but it was cool because it allowed you to buy pieces of stock (s), $1/month, whatever, build up to entire shares of major stocks and sell. Penny stocks can be crazy like that tho
447 2018-04-10 19:53:04 FTSE 100 follows global stocks higher after China signals open economy. Don't, for God's sake, let up on China until they keep their word. Keep the good work up President trump, not one ignorant Democrat had the guts to do what was needed to be done and you did it.
448 2018-04-10 19:52:41 IS THIS THE GREATEST BULL MARKET IN HISTORY ? #Stocks #Dow #Trump
449 2018-04-10 19:52:34 -They cut taxes for the rich and big companies
-Big companies use the tax savings to buy back their stock
-Stock prices go up
-The richest 10% own 80% of all stocks
-Meanwhile they pit regular Americans against immigrants and minorities for whatever’s left
450 2018-04-10 19:52:15 A noble effort but folks will still buy stocks that provide returns. Ethical investing has shown to have a small  impact.
451 2018-04-10 19:51:54 Have you checked out the other Canadian MJ stocks? See any breakout volume? Bounced off a low RSI this morning
452 2018-04-10 19:51:31 Any senate hearing is extra boost for the stocks cue $EFX
453 2018-04-10 19:51:12 Not particularly. The shot may pan out, it may not. Doesn’t really pile up stocks (not a red flag, more like yellow), and doesn’t really create opportunities for teammates. Not sure he impacts the game in enough ways to have him higher

457 2018-04-10 19:48:54 All asset classes; stocks (mining, tech, financial), pensions, property, mining and cryptos are on a slow recovery path and many won't.
458 2018-04-10 19:48:49 15 minutes to go and tightening up the stops (overnite headline/bs risk per usual). A lot of stocks flying today (ironically not airlines). $TMQ on #Copper picked up 8% - taking 2/3 off. If $1.30 holds will replay tomorrow

464 2018-04-10 19:46:38 Are you still using degiro? So many stocks are not available and you can't short anything...what's your favorite broker?
465 2018-04-10 19:46:37 Capital is used to buy stock increasing stock value benefiting the top of 10% of Americans who own 80% of all stocks. There is little investment in capital endeavours or notable impact on salaries. Trickle down has never worked
466 2018-04-10 19:46:34 Hmmm...that's not my experience. Sorry. My stocks are up; one of my black friends has a job BECAUSE of Trump policies; he put a constitution-loving man in the Supreme Court. Think what you want--but my experience is different.
467 2018-04-10 19:46:20 It's suspicious when gold only rallies $4-$5 after seeing $10--plus days.  A 3.67% jump in crude in one session implies inflation ahead.  Bonds relatively calm, stocks not worried at all.  Russia warns intervention will have dire consequences.  Does Trump want to take a chance?
468 2018-04-10 19:46:05 If I read right before you're investing in penny stocks? In a past life I worked customer service at an investment firm sharebuilder, learned penny stocks fluctuate like that a lot, gotta watch em every second open bell to close to win
469 2018-04-10 19:46:01 What do ya mean
Do i google best exercise for beer belly or the best stocks to invest in???????
470 2018-04-10 19:45:11 They are blind to price. If enough money blindly buys “good stocks” without regard to price, you have a bubble
471 2018-04-10 19:45:02 The only reason he is being questioned is because you all lost money when the stocks fell

474 2018-04-10 19:42:00 very true. I find everyone flips too quickly though, as soon as these stocks go down for a few days in a row, everyone is a Bear and predicting MUCH lower prices - thats my signal to add more :P
475 2018-04-10 19:41:59 Today is buy tech stocks because we all know Congress is a joke.

481 2018-04-10 19:39:57 No way!!!! Are you for real?  Mind blown!  My parents are already going, so it would be just me.  Thank you so much, this is amazing!  My name is Eamon Stocks. 
482 2018-04-10 19:39:39 Exactly. All the stocks the top level players sold off is an obvious sign of their #corruption. And they're going after them for Trump's ties to their collecting data? As usual, the swamp is avoiding the real issue.

486 2018-04-10 19:38:32 @TMFJMo @MarketFoolery $TWTR also up about the same. Would love to hear y’all discuss the good/bad ripple effect some stocks have on their peers and why that seems to happen in some cases but not others.
487 2018-04-10 19:38:30 Was wondering the same thing except I was thinking stocks.
488 2018-04-10 19:38:10 If you’re in with trump you can buy up shares from targeted entities who’s stocks are plummeting. Tomorrow they may bounce back at the flick of a tweet.
489 2018-04-10 19:37:54 Damn picking good stocks is almost more rewarding than working hard
490 2018-04-10 19:37:47 Are MJ stocks at their bottom? I'm not sure, but I sold my non-registered MJ stocks today, and then repurchased them, to crystalize my capital losses, to offset my capital gains from earlier in the year, and anticipated gains from later this year. 2018 tax planning in effect.

499 2018-04-10 19:31:24 It is the unique combination of your finding stocks with big increases in sales, earnings and return on equity plus strong chart patterns revealing institutional buying that together will materially improve your stock selection and timing.

525 2018-04-10 19:20:08 Custody is part of an ancient law. In old days where traditional stocks were on paper there is a rule that a trusted 3rd party should hold the stocks:custody.

526 2018-04-10 19:19:57 What the Headlines Today SHOULD BE: China Blinks. Stocks Rally. President Trump’s strategy may just be working! Instead the headlines are about quotes from Stormy Daniels’ lawyer. The Press is the Enemy. Never forget it.

Sit out the first 15 minutes of trading at the opening bell. Let the market/stocks settle down first. More important not to start off the day with a big loss due to early swings.

805 2018-04-10 17:18:59 I wouldn't post any pictures like that on the day of a very tricky CL away match which we are more then capable of losing 4/5-0 & becoming laughing stocks, again.

806 2018-04-10 17:18:07 I’m pretty much out on Facebook these days. This is what happens when success goes to ones head the hard downward spiral has begun. Sell the stocks.

823 2018-04-10 17:10:38 10% of the population owns 84% of US stocks.  Coincidentally, that's roughly the same percent that the 9% of white South Africans own on the Joburg exchange.  I don't know if "economic apartheid" is the right way to put it here, but it's an interesting analogy.
824 2018-04-10 17:10:25 I have been around a while as well, and I fully admit I know nothing, and Anything can and will happen.  All I can conclude is there is a massive agenda to keep stocks bid by TPTB.   Stability/debt levels, all kinds of things....     Could be wrong, of course

826 2018-04-10 17:08:51 A Reuters’ poll found that US crude oil stocks likely increased by 220,000 bbl, following an increase week before. The build, if confirmed would further support the upward trend started in mid-January.

834 2018-04-10 17:07:06 $SPY  My 2 cents.  If you're positioning in stocks, wait for a pullback and start small. The last thing you want is to be potentially chasing stocks in this market. Be selective and with reasonable stops, being content with the risk.
835 2018-04-10 17:06:57 The Department of Justice on March 23, 2018 announced a change to the regulatory status of bump stocks, classifying stocks as "machine guns" and effectively banning the devices in the United States under existing federal law. Oct. 2018.

847 2018-04-10 17:03:33 I don"t know about that. This move now is based on future earnings. I did see that their stock price was down 10% but most pension plans and shareholders are more diversified than just Kinder Morgan stocks.

929 2018-04-10 16:32:50 Hard to say who won my bet with @DarinNewsom. USDA raised stocks of wht bly and oats by cutting feed/residual but not by a lot. I guess they'll do it by 1000 cuts. Otherwise, they'll look bad.

Basically, there are no stocks/sectors without risk. And I get paid because of suitably taking the risk.

940 2018-04-10 16:30:24 Before you enjoy your procceds of the tax cut, consider this. Economists state that our national debt is bound for dangerous proportions. This could mean, devaluation of the dollar, sharp cut in value of your stocks and an increase in interest rates. The Americans are gullible.
941 2018-04-10 16:30:05 Daily Factoid via @WSJMoneyBeat: On this day in 1822, merchant ship Cambria docked in NY harbor carrying news that Bank of England lowered its discount rate from 5% to 4%. Bank stocks fell 14% in two hours as Wall Street digested the news, which took two weeks to cross the ocean.

1002 2018-04-10 16:11:05 USDA only cut corn feed usage by 50 million bushels, which is on the light side considering the larger-than-expected stocks seen on March 29. That's the biggest difference I have with USDA on domestick ending stocks. #OATT

Making it illegal to sell bump stocks and high-capacity magazines is a top priority of mine as well. Almost every ammendment has restrictions, the 2nd shouldnt be immune.

1057 2018-04-10 15:59:14 @VelshiRuhle I do not object if a person's retirement fund buys multi stocks. But I believe personal stock should be grounds to RESIGN from a committee that INFLUENCES stock.
THAT is DIAMETRICALLY  opposed  to influence peddling STATUS QUO of today's REAL CORPORATE GOVERNANCE.

#VelshiRuhle
1072 2018-04-10 15:54:03 @VelshiRuhle it is a conflict of interest & mucking things up but as you said. It's stocks, not illegal to own stocks.

I guess you're going to have to trust them to do the right thing for the country & democracy.
1073 2018-04-10 15:54:02 So it is a Xi Jinping Rally day in stocks. $DJIA up more than 400 points. swing swing on trade war risk remains the game.

1078 2018-04-10 15:52:58 That's quite common. Especially with these dirtball OTC stocks. MJTK in particular actually has little potential of running anywhere though. This level of dilution has gone well beyond what's needed to keep things going month to month. This is a garbage stock.
1079 2018-04-10 15:52:32 I agrees they should not be allowed to vote on regulations that affect stocks they own.
1080 2018-04-10 15:52:24 Depends on the timing ... i trade stocks also ...won some € last year ... if bitcoin drop to 500$ i could say it s over but for the moment for me it still rising in autumn was 5000  .... i have bought riple at 1/2/3 dollars ... i m strong i m holding i believe in this shit
1081 2018-04-10 15:52:15 Of course congressmen should divest of any related stocks or turn it over to a blind trust. It is akin to insider trading, otherwise.
1082 2018-04-10 15:51:44 @VelshiRuhle I don’t have a problem with them owning stock. As long as it’s trans parent. As long as there’s no insider trading. And should be limited and legislation on Stocks they own. And the actions they can take on the Stocks they own. monitored by the public.

.then ok by me @JoyAnnReid
1087 2018-04-10 15:50:28 .@VelshiRuhle the problem w/ making them sell the stocks before taking action could appear as if they knew which way they would vote and sold shares to avoid losing money. Same goes if they don't sell and take favorable action for FB.

No matter what they can't win.
1088 2018-04-10 15:50:27 #VelshiRuhle lawmakers with direct investment in stocks should recuse themselves, if part of mutual fund, eft general holdings then it's ok
1089 2018-04-10 15:50:23 I'm not saying striking Syria is wrong, we should, however plan accordingly and strike stocks only to the best of our ability.  If this doesn't start WW3, then when he eventually strikes North Korea, that will.  Wait until the GOP loses Congress in November...

1105 2018-04-10 15:47:16 Agreed, leveling weapons was a pain in the ass. I would rather a system where we expand on the case we currently have and introduce scopes, grips, stocks, selectable enemy damage mods and selectable sub class benefit perks. Leave what's already there. Add revamped weapons on top
1106 2018-04-10 15:47:01 Stocks are soaring. Only 47 companies in the S&P 500 are lower today. American Airlines and Hershey are the biggest losers. Go figure. I'll discuss the rally -- and whether it can continue -- with @maggielake on @cnni just after noon ET.

1112 2018-04-10 15:46:04 Agreed! After some research, @SenBillNelson voted in favor of the assault weapons ban and raising the buying age for rifles like the AR-15 to 21, as well as for banning bump stocks. His @NRA rating is an F and he’s taken $0 from them. He’s the one to vote for in my book!

1117 2018-04-10 15:44:35 True. But they are used to hedge and trade in stocks. And they could be used to hedge risks in other things like adverse weather. Speculation is going to be a part of any market where risk can be transferred.
1118 2018-04-10 15:44:21 Xi utters a few words and drives stocks up 500 points?  I'd say that's some powerful gun powder given that US stocks are 150% of US GDP...

1122 2018-04-10 15:43:08 So 6.1 innings in 11 games is more valuable than a let’s say 6IP per start? You metrics guys crack me up.  Put him as your #3 Starter. That is more valuable than what you analytics call high leverage outs.

1141 2018-04-10 15:33:53 Challenging your beliefs is prudent. Some try to be different or sensationalize which is not the answer. Financially speaking, there is still much persuasion to avoid stocks with no credible stats over the long run. Fear sells much more than rational optimism.

1432 2018-04-10 13:53:51 Case in point, current downturn in marijuana sector and bitcoin/block chain stocks. I believe I've taken profits enough, losses enough, that those stocks I own are that expensive therefore, if earnings do come in or positive progression in biz plan occurs, sps should recover....

1436 2018-04-10 13:53:31 I love to buy stocks at time when
- They are not discussed in any whatsupp group
- No hashtags in social media
- Ignored by mass.

And SELL
-When mass is euphoric about it.
-When It is everywhere on social media/whatsupp.

Its a min 5 year journey
How many of us are lone hunters?
1437 2018-04-10 13:52:48 Just wondering....
With all this Trump and China back and fourth..driving the stocks up and down...
Are the 1%ers investing making a killing
Or was It orchestrated that way

1444 2018-04-10 13:49:50 Yeah...definately stocks will react to political happening. But my point here is that this particular reaction wasn't due to buhari's 2nd term bid. It was due to the recent sell offs in the stock market
1445 2018-04-10 13:49:21 I wouldn't be surprised if Xi takes advantage of the pathetic and panicky investors and signals trade war moves again to drive stock prices down so he can buy some more bargain stocks and then talk nice again to make the markets, and his new purchases, rise in value.

1459 2018-04-10 13:45:20 Stuck with some of it. Overall have a bearish view on stocks in Q2 so looking for up days to enter some shorts. Yesterday was a good one since it was a no-volume melt up.

1468 2018-04-10 13:42:21 I’ve watched inside reports & consistently CEOs, upper corporate management dump stocks prior to major drops. It’s NOT a fair playing field.
1469 2018-04-10 13:42:16 I don't disagree with the point but even at market peaks, lots of stocks are off 52wk highs ("high" implies that). On 1/26/18, 117 stocks (23% of S&P 500) were already off 10% from highs and the index was at 2,872 (i.e., dropped 9% since).
1470 2018-04-10 13:40:49 $AGN $CELG I am long both stock in long portfolio but selling calls and put speaking short term selling put into earnings is a good way to get into these stocks at lower multiples and prices.

1472 2018-04-10 13:39:57 What is your guidance of operation,  other than the Belief that POT stocks will go up in values over time? Just curious - Our technical folks don't dare try to out-smart the markets - we just follow the markets...

1480 2018-04-10 13:36:20 I agree with you, especially about banking. just saying that there are mixed views (I for one think that productivity will decline, but cookie maker stocks will rise), and there will be dodgy players. But you get the dodgy shit in any fast-rising market. Just look at ICOs

1496 2018-04-10 13:31:03 I know this is a serious issue but the headline reminds me of a children’s book Madeline goes to Paris or whatever. I would say Mr Smith Goes to Washington, but I don’t think Mark is up to any good. Just praying his stocks go back up.
1497 2018-04-10 13:31:00 Invest in real estate, invest in 2-family homes, invest in stocks, invest in a friends business. Before you buy your kicks and clothes invest in something with some equity. Life is a marathon stop running through it like you’re sprinting through life. #HussleAndMotivate

1500 2018-04-10 13:29:29 Sure, in many ways, indian markets, specifically stocks, seem to behave in a totally different arc, in comparison with backtests on S&P
1501 2018-04-10 13:29:19 Today in 1822, the merchant ship Cambria docks in NY harbor with news that the @bankofengland lowered interest rates from 5% to 4%.  Bank stocks lose 14% of their value in 2 hours.  It only took 2 weeks for news to travel across the ocean.

1510 2018-04-10 13:26:10 Most people simply don't understand stocks and the F.mkt.The stocks fell for obvious and expected reasons. Nothing new here. Criticise based on what he's responsible for, not the other way.
1511 2018-04-10 13:25:53 Worthless prediction: stocks open near the highs of the day, as markets process that Cohen news probably worse than thought, Xi news likely less positive than headlines.
1512 2018-04-10 13:25:27 There is nothing wrong if another stock which you do not hold is going up. All stocks don't move together. Maybe your stock is preparing for a mega move and the other one which is running currently is on the verge of mega fall. 

Do your homework on what u hold and have patience?

1517 2018-04-10 13:23:49 Note to self...Some stocks on my current list have earnings only a week away. Be mindful of those dates on every trade.
1518 2018-04-10 13:23:39 Yes by market cap. This is a tech index so it will be heavily loaded with big cap tech. You may prefer the STX500 which has a much lower weighting of tech stocks and more finance, oil etc.

1520 2018-04-10 13:23:14 Given that it has been EU bank stocks which are tanking and they never really deleveraged or recapitalized like the big US banks, and with China’s banking system a train wreck of leverage, why so focused on US as cycle catalyst? When was last time back 2 back cycles were similar?
1521 2018-04-10 13:23:06 All stocks.
1522 2018-04-10 13:23:01 Spring Sale Now On, Many amazing deals with up to 50% off selected ranges. These deals are only while stocks last so be quick to grab a bargain.

All these stunning tiles are now at reduced prices.
1523 2018-04-10 13:22:51 Agree, but Short is not a ft bowler and not sure Gopal can be sole spinner. Between Short/Buttler/Stocks/Samson/Rahane/Tripathi, batting is covered. Loughlin's spot needs to rotate between good spinner/Archer depending on the pitch. If spinner can bi pinch hitter, even better!
1524 2018-04-10 13:21:20 Many stocks already in no-man's-land are even more so with today's gap. Most on my list will likely gap 1-2%. $spy

- Allocate peanuts to 100s of stocks
1551 2018-04-10 13:11:39 If chemical attack was made, authors should respond to International Court.

1576 2018-04-10 13:05:12 @SquawkStreet @jimcramer You're not a lawyer, or a stock expert, you seem to play both on TV. It was a legal search signed off by a Trump appointed federal  judge and the DOJ, also Trump appointed. Stocks dropped because @realDonaldTrump opened his big mouth.
1577 2018-04-10 13:05:07 If you’re a long-term investor, the biggest risk to reaching your goals likely isn’t a bear market. Stocks’ long-term annualized return of 10% includes bear markets! Bigger risk? Missing bull returns. #TuesdayThoughts

1582 2018-04-10 13:02:46 So the value of Aluminum is dropping, just like stocks, which means people are selling off their shares (interest in the value of the product) and loosing money but you are patting yourself on the back for this? Makes for a great tweet I guess.
1583 2018-04-10 13:02:37 I expect a spike to somewhere around 100k followed by a crash to the high double digits.

But in 65yrs, yes, stocks will end up right here around $SPX 2600. Zero return, not including a 1% yield.

1620 2018-04-10 12:38:53 I would love to see the list.  Both companies I work for cut benefits, raised deductibles, and cut back hours.  Our son’s tuition and board are 20,000+ at U of A.  Stocks are starting to nosedive.  But let’s spend money on a wall and never ending useless wars that we started.
1621 2018-04-10 12:38:37 It also depends on how much a person starts with in retirement and how elastic their spending is during retirement. It’s part of the reason why tiny homes and an RV lifestyles are becoming more popularity. I think a 4% withdrawal is still doable with straight stocks and bonds.

1628 2018-04-10 12:35:19 Public stocks aren't needed to run a company either. Fundraisers shouldn't mutilate software protocols though, but if a token implies governance votes for instance, that's already more than regular stocks tend to offer.
1629 2018-04-10 12:35:06 May crude oil and gasoline on Monday closed higher on a weaker dollar and the rally in stocks, which shows confidence in the economic outlook that is positive for energy demand.

1631 2018-04-10 12:34:38 Yes, patently clear. It's perfectly fair to point out obvious errors though, hardly antisemitic to say that she had stopped supporting Labour in 2014. They could try to spin it I suppose, but frankly, they would end up as laughing stocks.

1635 2018-04-10 12:33:00 You don’t need to be a Cassandra about current market prospects to seek out alternative risk premia with the chance to earn slightly higher returns net of taxes and fees, while also offering some protection against a sustained economic environment unfavourable to stocks or bonds.
1636 2018-04-10 12:32:51 Monday's closes: TYM8 -3.5, FVM8 -2.5. Jun 10-year T-notes on Monday closed lower on reduced safe-haven demand after stocks moved higher and on supply pressures as the Treasury auctions $64 billion of T-notes and T-bonds this week.
1637 2018-04-10 12:32:30 There was also carry-over support from a rally in European stocks on upbeat comments from ECB President Draghi who said the ECB "expects the pace of economic expansion in the Eurozone to remain strong in 2018." 

Energy stocks saw support as crude oil prices rallied +2.19%.

1655 2018-04-10 12:25:55 Hmm...how might you expect bonds and stocks to behave during a sustained period of lower than expected growth, more extreme inflation, and/or less abundant liquidity conditions. Say like the 1970s, or Japan since 1990? Or do these scenarios seem completely implausible?
1656 2018-04-10 12:25:07 My learnings: when your stock is not moving up with Nifty, it needs serious FA+TA to understand why it's not moving up. Need to understand the problem.

So periodically cut the underperformers, And buy the stocks which are breaking out.

1667 2018-04-10 12:22:10 Loaded question! My opinion, at the core, all a portfolio really needs is one or two stock funds and one or two bond funds. Stocks should capture the global markets and bonds should be mainly US investment grade. All else is the flavor of the icing on the cake.

1686 2018-04-10 12:15:14 Many of us realize that owning a few of the top holding of the etf's we like can be done without incurring fees.  I like them because they are a great place to look for individual stocks and bonds.  I do use an etf for emerging market bonds though-fees are still too high.

1806 2018-04-10 11:04:26 Europe Markets: Europe stocks hit multiweek highs after China dials back on trade rhetoric
1807 2018-04-10 11:04:21 Bump stocks allow faster trigger pulls at the expense of accuracy. No military is the world uses them. The Las Vegas shooter allegedly used one or more because he was indiscriminately firing into a crowd, where accuracy was moot. This is significant. This is not pedantry.

1832 2018-04-10 10:40:46 I have been playing as a long term investor with quality stocks.

2026 2018-04-10 08:10:05 The stocks are outperforming the commodity.  That's a good sign. Also stocks tend to go on their own schedule.  More leverage in the miners vs. The commodity unless you own futures or options in commodity.
2027 2018-04-10 08:09:28 The Russian market panic (and subsequent ruble dip) is reminiscent of Dec 14, 2014. Lots of obsessive coverage of Russian stock prices being 'destroyed', yet (and this is a stock market spoiler alert), all the stocks rebounded, over time.

2091 2018-04-10 07:10:38 Markets are efficient enough so that one day stocks will approach their approximate 'fair' value. The challenge is in working out what that approximate 'fair' value is and when the market is likely to agree with you.

2104 2018-04-10 07:05:11 Always worth taking the longer view with frontier stocks, but investors have some tempting alternatives to Russia at the moment and there’s additional uncertainty over the structure and conduct of privatisation.

2194 2018-04-10 06:12:25 The options were shit. Volume in them was shit. Everything was based around spot. 
Nowadays the leveraged options lead the market.

2245 2018-04-10 05:35:42 Mansion? Yacht? Amazon stocks? Lol
2246 2018-04-10 05:34:22 Holding is only good advice vs trading in and out and generating taxes and trading fees. For that reason it’s somewhat good advice (same with stocks). I don’t like it with respect to being a true believer.
2247 2018-04-10 05:34:16 It's amazing what a single press release can do in terms of stocks. President Xi (China) promises lower tariffs and stocks via after-market trading have already gone up, and I've gained almost $700 already...
2248 2018-04-10 05:34:13 Stock brokers always wants(infact provokes) you to buy and sell the stocks frequently:
They can generate business turnover only when u buy and sell.
1.Long term holding for compounding=Gain to Investor
2.Frequent buy/sell=Gain to Brokers.
What's your Choice?
2249 2018-04-10 05:34:06 Can you imagine what would happen if we demanded a random political candidate drawing.  The corporate lobbyists would freak, the stocks would fall.  We the people could call it a hostile takeover of Corporate America.

2282 2018-04-10 05:07:09 You misunderstood my argument. Bump stocks are perfectly legal, but the conversion from semi to fully automatic is not...unless you go through the paperwork and procedures of owning a fully automatic weapon, which Paddock did not do.

2334 2018-04-10 04:20:19 Nope, “well regulated” is all I’m after. Universal background checks, no bump stocks. 10 round clips. 21yrs old to buy. You can even keep the AR15 and similar models.
2335 2018-04-10 04:20:09 It’s the same principle. Your portfolio’s valuation on paper is only as real as your ability to sell the stocks at the quoted price. The higher the volume of transactions, the more real.

2351 2018-04-10 04:08:34 #AxisBank has next resistance around 528-530. That level will imply open interest addition would not be strong, if crossed, then sharp run up and addition will happen. I believe that has lower chance.

2586 2018-04-10 01:25:24 Thanks for the really good Q. RS Rating is best used for selecting, buying #stocks, not when to sell. Why? IBD's Relative Price Strength Rating covers 12 months' worth of price action. In $MU, the 12-day sell-off is sharp but RS won't change drastically

2592 2018-04-10 01:21:02 Totally, neither are scenarios where hoards of zombies assault your house and you need bump stocks and 100rnd drums to fend them off.  Doesn't change that whole "reasonable restrictions" part I was talking about.

2594 2018-04-10 01:20:51 I'll give you Kudlow. Stockman has some knowledge of economics, but he's mostly a manager type guy (nothing wrong with that). Cramer may know stocks, but that does NOT make him an economist.
2595 2018-04-10 01:19:36 With Japan bailing out Russia's oil markets, Russia attempting to profit off past trade/investments made with Turkey, trading with Japan or Turkey is no longer beneficial and could have unintended consequences. It would also shock energy stocks.

chemical weapon attacks: stocks go up
totally normal economy
2659 2018-04-10 00:25:46 You want investigations into something that has no plausible alternative scenario? (Except the racist and idiotic assumption that Syrians keep stocks of sarin only to periodically gas their own children). 

Yes, that's apologia.
2660 2018-04-10 00:23:35 Gas Prices 
Stocks 
Number of bankrupting companies 
Size of the national debt 
Yup, @realDonaldTrump the economy really is doing great. 
Really love paying more for gas, losing money in the stocks, watching stores close, and worrying about the debt.
2661 2018-04-10 00:21:33 My retirement was moved put of stocks on 11/10/2016.
2662 2018-04-10 00:21:26 I will be a pro golfer one day. After I lost all my money on stocks because I think charts are everything. Inshallah
2663 2018-04-10 00:20:16 But long-term: bullish stocks bearish bonds.. bullish crypto ($BTC)
2664 2018-04-10 00:17:56 The economy is a lot more "managed" now than it was pre-08. Mortgage market nationalized, BOJ openly buying stocks... stuff that was unthinkable before. I think the next crisis will come from the geopolitical or technical horizons (AI, weaponized biotech), etc.
2665 2018-04-10 00:17:49 The politicians need to sell their stocks.
2666 2018-04-10 00:17:30 Borrowing Yen to buy stocks is great as long stocks rise and Yen weakens..
2667 2018-04-10 00:17:29 Keep in mind that if stocks go south, I will be seeing that as an opportunity to buy. I'm not a Chicken Little investor. And I'd like to think I have time on my side to wait.

I hope.
2668 2018-04-10 00:17:06 Why? Because he's doing what he campaigned on? I know America isn't use to a politician actually doing what he says!! Stocks are up- taxes are down- law and order is being enforced- Isis is dead-military is getting back #lifeisgood
2669 2018-04-10 00:16:18 Not when US stocks dump..
2670 2018-04-10 00:16:11 Me looking at bowl of fries: I could not possibly eat all of these. 
Me licking the bowl clean: I should invest in potato stocks.
2671 2018-04-10 00:15:58 Trade tensions not hurting #cotton and tighter US ending stocks coming tomorrow

2673 2018-04-10 00:14:44 I wonder if Bolton has stocks in any weapon manufacturing companies

2675 2018-04-10 00:13:46 @larry_kudlow Do you have no shame? We're you lying in 2009 or now? It appears that your integrity goes to the highest bidder! Another old rich man profiting at the expense of our country. I bet you have shorted a lot of stocks over the last few days. Mmmm?
2676 2018-04-10 00:13:38 " Many investors are finding investing difficult while the market lacks direction" - DB

the moment 25-year-old hedge funders discover stocks can also go down.
2677 2018-04-10 00:13:16 We can DO something about guns, about availability of AR15s, high capacity magazines, bump stocks, background checks.  Mental services for people, for potential shooters, - fine, but DO something about guns.
2678 2018-04-10 00:13:04 Those are some great stocks for the long haul. I'm always watching Berkshire and Markel.

2683 2018-04-10 00:07:16 forex or stocks?
2684 2018-04-10 00:07:04 I have been looking for you they stopped me from selling my stocks with fidelity I wanted your bank and you all referred me to Fidelity they are so racist in Greensboro North Carolina that's the Johnson I need your support I need your help call me
2685 2018-04-10 00:05:48 Actually she is correct coming from an invidual, who has a masters degree in economics. The wealthy are not invested in companies like normal practices. What i am refering too is that they are investing in buy backs in stocks to raised the stock so they can make a profit.
2686 2018-04-10 00:05:37 Dude be respectful of analysts who are cautious on stocks because they don’t get paid there to be cautious... too easy to be bullish and at 9bn for a P1 asset so far no evidence pharma ceos make good investors
2687 2018-04-10 00:05:28 I’m hearing if/ when the stock market crash (seeing that it’s over due) it will be HUGE for crypto as people pull out their stocks and deposit into crypto.
2688 2018-04-10 00:02:17 Hey @pfizer didn’t you stop researching cures for Parkinson’s Disease & Alzheimer’s Disease so you could use the money, coupled with the tax credit Trup so generously handed you, to buy back stocks? 
The rich get richer & the rest get screwed. 

2689 2018-04-10 00:01:24 Usually a good sign when finish line stocks
2690 2018-04-10 00:00:00 Good for all the Marijuana stocks ( I hope )
