I hate to tell her this but socialism by itself will not even run.  It needs the money generated by a capitalist system. Look at Russia & China.  They use the capitalist money to oil their whole system.
64 2018-07-19 23:51:57 How about producing our oil?  Build a large plant, create jobs instead and lower our overall gas prices by not depending on the USA to refine our oil!!!
65 2018-07-19 23:51:50 I've steamed a lot of broccoli, but damn...toss it with olive oil, garlic & salt before roasting @ 450F for 20 minute...so good!!

His career shows no interest in agriculture, but give him oil, gas or coal & lhe will do back flips to help them! Who got him to run for Senate .. an oil Barron fro out of state.
67 2018-07-19 23:51:46 I think you meant Trillions added to the debt. NK is busy building up  NUKES.  NATO is spending  same amount  agreed to  in 2014.   Farmers are loosing their shirts .  ISIS is not gone yet.  He wants to sell oil to Germany himself.   US manfctres starting to leave due to tariffs.

150 2018-07-19 23:38:50 I’m super confused did CBD oil become legal in Utah because all of the sudden there is a store advertising it near me

152 2018-07-19 23:38:44 My favorite part of Keto is getting to drink pretty much as much iced coffee as I want (as long as I blend it with coconut oil butter or use heavy whipping cream only)

Kid (6): “daddy, can we go to (spells) T-O-Y-S-R-U-S”
Dad: “well, son... there’s something I have to tell you..”
Kid: “is it closed still?”
Dad: “it’s gonna be closed for a long time.”
Kid and I start tearing up together.

155 2018-07-19 23:38:13 I got an oil stain on my fave shirt... I'm so saddd
156 2018-07-19 23:38:04 What kind of oil are you using?
157 2018-07-19 23:37:59 People will buy some nasty oil cuz iff cheap. Like why would you put that in your body 
158 2018-07-19 23:37:54 I'm so good at digging my own grave, oil companies sometimes use me.
159 2018-07-19 23:37:48 Isn’t it obvious that Turkey has supported ISIS all along? It’s let them get oil, artifacts and everything else out through their border to fund their fight. Why the world has allowed this is beyond my understanding
160 2018-07-19 23:37:45 My favourite bit of the current Treasury Model of the economy is the part that models North Sea oil. Why is that there? Well, oil was discovered. Before that, no prediction of the TM would have included it. Computer models have their limitations.
161 2018-07-19 23:37:34 And to lift sanctions to get a deal from opening Russia’s  oil fields
162 2018-07-19 23:37:21 Black castor oil doesn’t work for beard growth, only woman juice.
163 2018-07-19 23:37:20 yikes time to add oil to my list
164 2018-07-19 23:36:41 I mean if we're gonna have this New World Order.. w/ Putin at the helm .. shouldn't we be focused on getting them out of gas/oil bomb & screw every1 expansionism .& into renewables. . just holding out hope. bcus tbh. don't think voting's gonna to work unless election integrity
165 2018-07-19 23:36:35 (but... but... but... broiled brussel sprouts with olive oil, salt and pepper is a favorite of mine!)  =p  
Yeah, it's gonna being redoing my gear sets.
166 2018-07-19 23:36:35 Putin Puppet would be doing:

- Limit fracking
- Block oil & gas pipelines
- Cut US Military Spending
- Reduce Tensions with Iran

1. WHICH CANDIDATE Campaigned on that?  
2. WHOSE WH Administration DID JUST THAT?

ANSWERS:
1.  HILLARY
2.  President Barack OBAMA
167 2018-07-19 23:36:21 If Coconut Oil Made Out Of Coconuts, What’s Baby Oil made out of ? Abortions?
168 2018-07-19 23:36:02 蒸し焼きにやれるな、これw
169 2018-07-19 23:35:54 @jonlovett You’re not alone: I also think that truffle oil smells like Actual Poison and I cannot imagine how anyone would want to be in the same room as that unholy putridity, much less put it inside their fragile human body.
170 2018-07-19 23:35:54 Germany just signed a multi-billion-dollar contract with Russia to buy Russian oil. All countries should be adversarial to each other in regards to their economies and what is good for their people. This is called competition, and competition breeds strength in those who compete
171 2018-07-19 23:35:29 If its latex paint water and soap. If its oil based use a paint thinner and scrubbing pad or wire brush
172 2018-07-19 23:35:10 The next hump could be the last of this cycle. I hope it gets low. We are near a big resistance so.....
173 2018-07-19 23:35:02 Man, this air fryer needa come in ASAP because my mom keeps demanding I make her curly fries. This oil is a death trap. 
174 2018-07-19 23:34:44 I also have a hard time respecting protestors who are standing there holding plastic signs, sitting in plastic lawn chairs and complaining about the dangers of oil spills.  Then they get into cars with plastic body panels. and drive hundreds of miles back home.
175 2018-07-19 23:34:31 there’s a context link between dating and finding a new oil change place that wont fuck you over

177 2018-07-19 23:34:12 randy took my car to get the cabin filter changed, tire pressure fixed, oil changed,car washed, & even brought me a coconut milk (,: i’ve finally been blessed w a man & i couldn’t be more thankful for him
178 2018-07-19 23:33:59 Exactly. That’s why I change my oil and fuel filters way before they’re recommended too
179 2018-07-19 23:33:52 The greatest irony being that the Gulf States began an alleged "war of liberation" in Syria because they wanted a pipeline to Europe through there, which would of course complete with Putin's Russian oil & gas.  Obama was too smart to be drawn in the way the Saudis & GOP wanted
180 2018-07-19 23:33:13 Yeah it was a nice manga, did you read the one about oil? That was disturbing
181 2018-07-19 23:33:09 I just wanna give somebody’s daughter a warm coconut oil massage.
182 2018-07-19 23:33:08 CCI Canadian Crude Index close for Jul 19th $41.17 US/bbl +$0.25 +0.60% #CCI #CanadianCrudeOil #CDNCRUDE #Oil #CCXETF $USO $DBO $OIL $UCCO
183 2018-07-19 23:32:59 Our CO2 footprint is high, in part, cuz we produce 3 million barrels/day of oil for the USA.  We don't consume it, they do.  Punishing CDN's for the USA consuming our oil is daft. Also, Canada could reduce CO2 to ZERO and it will make no impact, at all, on world climate.  None.
184 2018-07-19 23:32:49 Hope those kids pass on what they learn cause changing that corriculum for better or worse will be high on the to do list after.right after the conservatives realize it's not so easy without a booming oil patch.
185 2018-07-19 23:32:49 as I walk through the valley where I harvest my oil
I take a look at my life n realize theres zero toil
cuz I been sellin n tradin so much
aint not a tool in my life what I ever had to touch
but I aint never made a dollar n fair deserved it
perform my own labor u no thats unhrdof
186 2018-07-19 23:32:44 Landline should do a story on what effect the end of oil will have on food production. Ie cheap energy allows us to produce food cheaply....
187 2018-07-19 23:32:43 Manually inspecting an oil rig is time-consuming, expensive for oil companies, and can even be dangerous for workers. Now, #drones can be deployed to collect the right data in a fraction of the time.
188 2018-07-19 23:32:42 The language he used needs to be different, it needs to be respectful. If that is the case we need to stop buying stuff from China it just gives them U.S dollars to spend. The same goes for oil for the middle East and Russia. A very large portion of the food produce come from
189 2018-07-19 23:32:33 Hot oil treatments are remedying my fro

194 2018-07-19 23:31:51 You left out the millions of $$ in savings for Colorado consumers at the pump. Higher mpg = Lower gas bills. Money that stays in Colorado communities instead of going to global oil companies. No wonder they don’t like this 
195 2018-07-19 23:31:46 Bihh needa oil change 
196 2018-07-19 23:31:38 Obama beat the fuck out Russia. He let the dollar rally and oil plunged under $40 bankrupting Russia with the ruble hitting a 30 year low. Dude was a genius. He crushed their economy.
197 2018-07-19 23:31:37 I'm certainly not going to stop taking them from one article. And we do know that omega3 fish oil has benefits. But it's still a little disheartening to read. But, so what else is new, right?! We'll keep on keeping on. LoL
198 2018-07-19 23:31:29 Not really. In my great state of Wyoming, the coal mines are back producing clean burning coal. And you can tell by the many trains passing thru. The oil fields have dramatically picked up.

201 2018-07-19 23:31:14 Look up John Rockefeller and Standard oil. The reason The US has anti-monopoly laws in place. The man was ruthless, yet he was a philanthropist and a devout Christian. 
 So keep  going on about the Rothschilds. Just proving your DOUBLE Standards.

204 2018-07-19 23:30:56 I use calendula oil when I start getting psoriasis flare ups. There is also lotion. It’s so good with skin dryness. So is vitamin e oil and sweet almond oil (which are way easier to find).

210 2018-07-19 23:30:20 Oh!!! So it’s OUR FAULT that they Squabble over the Oil and kill each other over religious BS?!!!!! Ok!!!!:/ There has to be sum accountability for people’s own actions!!!!! And I’m tired of hearing all that CRAP from the Mid-East!!!!! Im FAR from PERFECT!!!!! WHATS YIURE RXCUSE?
211 2018-07-19 23:30:16 Well if the feds didn't step in and take over the pipeline Canada would be limited on options with the ongoing trade war with the USA. It would be cost prohibitive to sell more oil to China and India if it had to go by rail to the coast.
212 2018-07-19 23:30:13 Other than the fact he killed tens of thousands of innocent people in search of oil... oops I mean weapons of mass destruction. #SCUMBAG
213 2018-07-19 23:30:13 Trump is pulling out all stops. He knows after Mueller Report and mid-terms he will be forced from the WH so he wants to get the Russian sanctions removed before that time so the Roseneft/Exxonmoble Oil merger takes place and he and Putin can get paid. @WalshFreedom
214 2018-07-19 23:30:10 I’m not saying he was a good person, but gdp was good, unemployment low and the country was performing quite well... then he died and oil prices crashed, which the country relied upon so unrelated? Tough to blame a dead person on events that happen after they die...
215 2018-07-19 23:29:50 Obama's  2014 Fracking bill flooded the market with oil and lowered prices. That  along with sanctions decimated the Russian economy
216 2018-07-19 23:29:44 All that oil and gas money which soared from 1980-2000 and nothing to show for it. Until a way is found for low taxation not being used to buy votes problems will get worse and it's effecting public services & NHS too. Statute needed for compulsory funding of NIF & NHS.
217 2018-07-19 23:29:35 So an interesting thing happened as I pulled up to my apartment this evening - the power steering went out and when I looked at the dashboard the oil, battery, maintenance, etc lights were all lit up. Just had my alternator and battery replaced two months ago...thoughts?
218 2018-07-19 23:29:29 Your ex is a convicted felon and you were complicit, just as you are now. Did you write about how you spent over 4K on an oil painting of your kids, using hubby’s corporate credit card? You’re just as crooked as this president!
219 2018-07-19 23:29:27 Exactly.  If I’m payin for the oil change I’m doing it myself.

221 2018-07-19 23:29:17 Shops/pubs/restaurants are in melt-down. Consumer credit has been rising dangerously and now ‘maxed out’. Car sales  having been sustained by easy credit have now turned down.Britain  just one global recession, one world financial crisis or one oil price spike away from disaster.

230 2018-07-19 23:28:14 Oh you change your own oil? Sorry no warranty
231 2018-07-19 23:28:04 Have my mom $40 this morning for an oil change for my car and she just came back and said she spent $800 on my car....wut
232 2018-07-19 23:27:48 Apparently though Scotland gives away over 92% of its oil though , well when I say gives....

Thank goodness it wasn't major 
253 2018-07-19 23:24:03 Obama added strong protections for consumers & the environment while adding jobs & improving economy. Trump removes all protections, adds just a few jobs in coal and oil,  and says  I'm the greatest ever. He has built a house of cards!
254 2018-07-19 23:23:58 I buy cars that arnt perfect so I can learn something new. 3 years ago I didnt know how to change oil and now I can do so much more.
255 2018-07-19 23:23:58 The oil field doesn’t sound so bad right now
256 2018-07-19 23:23:49 its like these people who go around saying their magical oils can heal all problems because "it was in the bible" i wouldnt use a hairbrush to heal a cracked skull, so i aint using your 2k year old oil to do what we can do with tools meant to fix the issue

289 2018-07-19 23:18:51 Exactly. These people are slaves to them basically. What goes around comes around. The oil money won't last forever.
290 2018-07-19 23:18:51 Coal, oil & gas, deep sea harvesting, mining, etc. Not likely to see women in those fields. White collar isn’t different.

296 2018-07-19 23:17:34 I know how business works. Doesn't make it right & doesn't mean that's a group of people who care about nothing but appearances. Oil is a business, what they do & what they hide & lie about is also wrong. Are you going to defend them as well.
297 2018-07-19 23:17:33 Sorry for your family. My Grandfather ran away from Germany when he was 13 years old.....  Illegally immigrated to USA. Worked for Standard Oil and did well, but those were the good old days when corporations were owned by people, not the stock market.

305 2018-07-19 23:16:32 Oil is not cheap if you add the cost of what it is going to take to repair the damage (if we ever can).

351 2018-07-19 23:10:46 Liquid Fence. Alternatively, blend some egg in water and garlic oil and spray that on your plants. (Unless you plan to harvest them in the next few days.) It’s non-toxic and the animals don’t like the smell or taste. Just wash your stuff well, ‘cause you won’t either. Lol.
352 2018-07-19 23:10:35 That`s why they`re fuming so much. Cos we`ve done it the proper way. Through hard work and investment and development. And they can`t fucking stand knowing they`ve cheated their way to the top with hand outs from rich oil barons bailing them out. I love it right now.
353 2018-07-19 23:10:34 I just seen an article on a couple of studies that show the problem maybe at the end of a pipe that does not carry oil. Might want to look into the mortality rates due to human sewage in the Fraser and Victoria harbour.

446 2018-07-19 22:59:00 So are you planning a pogram to get rid of the “oil sands educated students “.    And you do realize that plastics come from petroleum - how do you propose we ship it even if the end goal is to continue to feed the crucial demand for plastic ....

454 2018-07-19 22:58:10 Ohh, I'm very glad that that brush was useful. 
By the way, Saitama looks amazing. It looks like I'm looking at an oil painting. 
I like the boots and the green you used looks great!
455 2018-07-19 22:58:00 apaqah aku berjodoh dengan essential oil?
456 2018-07-19 22:57:48 Oil is causing the biggest threat to human life and you’re behind that. Even if you don’t believe in climate change oil still causes cancer, asthma cardiac problems and so much more. Wake up you’re killing yourselves and us all with you
457 2018-07-19 22:57:48 Have you been having insomnia? 
My anxiety used to keep me up all night but I started taking CBD oil and it's helped tremendously
458 2018-07-19 22:57:47 Well, This all still seems like diplomacy, but the Executive sanctions are financially punitive plus a reduction in their diplomatic presence, and a public equation of the stature of Putin and Kim Jung Un. Unofficially, we keep bouncing the price of oil between $40 and 120.
459 2018-07-19 22:57:45 I just parboil it and throw it into a pan with oil, garlic, and red pepper, but I like it breaded and fried if someone else is making them.

462 2018-07-19 22:57:08 true points - but as an @ogcnice fan as well, I'm really not loving any more of my beloved Juve lads joining the dark side ....err I mean PSG. hell, even if I wasnt a Nice fan, I'd still not be thrilled ... but that oil  sure buying some talent. damn
463 2018-07-19 22:57:06 Yes, I used to go to the old time hardware stores for parts for antique locks, crystal knobs, and even parts for my oil lamps...now all gone
464 2018-07-19 22:57:05 It’s a bunch of vegetables covered in sugar and oil dressing that we eat to feel like we’re eating better when in reality they aren’t much healthier in his state. 
465 2018-07-19 22:57:01 They only come around when they can benefit from the chaos. If their was a oil reserve or a strategic military base that can be built there they will be all over it.
466 2018-07-19 22:57:00 Really great event and a superb opportunity to meet organisers, company execs and fellow investors...and to get the odd tip from Chris Oil!!
467 2018-07-19 22:56:55 Note: trade deficit financing needs will vary depending on oil prices.

USA, Saudi Arabia, China, World Bank, IMF and Asian Development Bank will bail them out (as always). No worries. 

Worst case scenario: PRINT RUPEES !!!!

469 2018-07-19 22:56:28 I was thinking about just eating it cold. It's way to hot down here to grill
anything. They're talking 108 my Monday! 
Cold tomato, core it, insert pitted olive and push in some feta in between the
tomato and olive. Drizzle of garlic infused olive oil maybe on top. ?

479 2018-07-19 22:54:15 Why are your oil pastels so expensive? Why do you hate me @sennelier1887 ? Can you please send me some? They’re my favorite thing.
480 2018-07-19 22:54:06 They were once with us, but the divisionary politics of NCNC in the south east made them breakaway from Nigeria, there is so much at stake here if they join the oil fields that was ceded to Cameroon during Obj tenure would return to us and am sure Biya wont like that
481 2018-07-19 22:53:58 I like to put it on the grill after tossing the asparagus with garlic, olive oil, lemon zest, and red pepper flakes.
482 2018-07-19 22:53:47 I’ve only been using coconut oil myself and extra virgin olive oil when I’m out or at a friend house
483 2018-07-19 22:53:45 Saudi Arabia is rich, but once the oil goes away and the laborers brought in from wherever leave, they are gonna be in trouble. In the South when slavery wasn’t available anymore and they had no industrial infrastructure... well.

489 2018-07-19 22:53:04 Crazy to think about the current EM pain and reflect on how tame food inflation is - if food inflation takes off during this strong dollar period EM will be in a lot of trouble 

Recent oil weakness is very helpful to EM - they desperately need oil to stay weaker for a while
490 2018-07-19 22:52:57 I'll be impressed when it's coconut oil.
491 2018-07-19 22:52:53 Cypress oil in a little almond oil. Rub in nightly. Smells like you’re in a deep dark forest. Which I wouldn’t advise at night. But still, works a treat.
492 2018-07-19 22:52:48 If you think the typical climate scientist is getting rich while the oil industry is impartial and unmotivated by money, I've got a Bridge in Brooklyn you should jump off of.
493 2018-07-19 22:52:46 Anyone who says Liverpool are buying the league are missing the point. It’s being done in a sustainable business-savvy way. Look at the sales, look at the purchases. We are not talking drunken sheik/Russian oil Barron spending, we are talking sustainable long term business

496 2018-07-19 22:52:20 Twenty thousand years ago, my part of the world was under ice reported to be about a mile thick. There just was not a lot of oil, coal and gas being used so what may I ask caused that ice to melt. Politicians ignore me when I ask that question.
497 2018-07-19 22:52:04 Hey @McDonalds my family all got a case of the McShits. What did you change? Oil gotta be dif. Quality continues going down. No more

501 2018-07-19 22:51:24 A little kosher or sea salt on the inside of the tomato before you stuff. The to should be real cold and cheese should be room to backyard temp so it softens before the tomato turns to  mush. Just char the outside to warm/melt basically. Drizzle in some garlic infused olive oil.

513 2018-07-19 22:50:18 Multicultualism only works when there is a shared "civilization" ...i.e. Western Civilization.  There has to be commonality re: democracy, women/children rights, tolerance, etc.  When you try to interject civilization that are antithesis to W. Civ. you will be mixing oil & water
514 2018-07-19 22:50:13 (KJV) Psalms 45:7 Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.

534 2018-07-19 22:47:25 Remember this only covers 1.3% off world emissions = little impact unfortunately. 
Most of it is EOR, which in effect only has 50% removal efficiency due to mixing with produced oil. 

Do we want this? 

#CCS should only be used for negative #CO2 emissions and no- option industry
535 2018-07-19 22:47:08 Nope, we gotta spend our money on giving tax cuts to the millionaires, corporations, oil companies.

We should spend the rest on destroying the environment, starting wars, putting kids in cages, bombing Muslims....

That's how we make America great again!

541 2018-07-19 22:46:32 It's an issue that he can raise, but has no chance of changing. Obviously, it's a better deal for Germany to get natural gas via pipeline from Russia than oil via tablet from us.
542 2018-07-19 22:46:11 Europe has taken for granted for some time as evident by its lack of commitment to minimum military spending within the treaty.  At the same time, Europe has become increasingly dependent on Russia for oil- the same Russia that NATO is supposed to provide defense against.
543 2018-07-19 22:46:11 I didn't know they were pushing that snake oil. I'll make sure I don't shop at #CVS
544 2018-07-19 22:46:08 We could charge them market price for oil.
545 2018-07-19 22:46:08 You came up with this conclusion based off of the fact that trump is a traitor? I can’t help that you bought the snake oil

569 2018-07-19 22:42:53 Oh do shut up Ann. The Falklands was defense of a British overseas territory, defending British persons. Iraq was premeditated war against a non-aggressor, a war crime that resulted in the death of over half a million people, and the destruction of a country for its resource; oil
570 2018-07-19 22:42:51 Thank God for my dad, I apparently had little to no oil in my car 
571 2018-07-19 22:42:48 #healthy goodness = 100% coconut oil (great sunblock base), parsley, cilantro, avocado, alkaline #water, green tea - go get em!

573 2018-07-19 22:42:40 We did! Though the name 'The Cartel' rather gives the game away about what they were up to. The oil industry regulators should have been on to them !
574 2018-07-19 22:42:39 Because we’re not at record high oil prices we’re struggling. No not true we are doing great and have recovered from a recession the Tories LED US IN TO!!!
575 2018-07-19 22:42:38 Ya hoe cooks with canola oil, that’s why she’s overweight and don’t even know it.

577 2018-07-19 22:42:22 You could've had all this oil
578 2018-07-19 22:42:20 There might be OIL in them there habitats gall durn it!
579 2018-07-19 22:42:19 If we must have a socialist/capitalist hybrid govt, I’d much rather have the kind with single payer, minimum income, environment protections and good public schools than the kind with Wall Street bailouts, oil and farm subsidies and the TSA.

582 2018-07-19 22:42:04 Just please for the sake of you not looking like a total asshat provide links to your assumptions about nati, and oil.
583 2018-07-19 22:42:04 Dan Coats suggested that with Trump and Putin on the same page, they can cause mass destruction, killing masses of people, from either side. Well, that is one way to reduce population down to 144,000 so they have enough oil forever. Doesn't bode well for the rest of us though.

586 2018-07-19 22:42:02 I wonder where Scotland gets its oil...
587 2018-07-19 22:42:01 Really ? Really ? Hang your head in shame ! 
You pushed through the sneaky add on clause (to the tax bill )that : 
SELLS Oil Drilling Rights to parcel 1002 of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. 
Use your brain & solve Alaska's job problem with innovation. 
You are shameful
588 2018-07-19 22:42:00 Texas oil and gas production aims to make America more energy secure and provide Texans with jobs!
589 2018-07-19 22:41:59 You missed your calling as a huckster, Indie! Or a Snack Oil Salesman, maybe... ;-)
590 2018-07-19 22:41:57 The only way for change is Independence then we can be like Norway. Roll on @LesleyRiddoch and @PhantomPower14 in their next production on Norway. Infractsructure envy of Scotland built on Oil revenue.
591 2018-07-19 22:41:56 Already have news, talking about Tesla 1/4 losses, pure evil. No worries, moats, and dinosaurs will transform in oil again, and nobody will care.
592 2018-07-19 22:41:45 African politicians are prohibiting the progression of their own countries. Africa is rich in resources, but terribly impoverished. Compare this to Qatar, Saudi Arabia, & Dubai -countries who also have oil resources, but claim their own profit.
593 2018-07-19 22:41:37 Oh word, let me manscape this here body and get my oil ready 
594 2018-07-19 22:41:35 Texas has the number one economy in the US... We have more oil than all of the Middle East, if we broke off the majority of America would be fucked! California is BROKE! So you have no idea what you’re talking about!
595 2018-07-19 22:41:28 Day 3 of no smoke still good I'm not going to smoke another black or cigg while on this break but I'm probably gonna invest in some cbd oil.
596 2018-07-19 22:41:24 I'm more worried about what "hardened receptacle oil" might be.
597 2018-07-19 22:41:19 feverfew and fine liquid silver? claims it work as well as cinnamon and coconut oil tea...but that might twerk your stomahce. It did mine.
598 2018-07-19 22:40:58 What type of oil do we have more of and what type of oil do we import from Russia?
599 2018-07-19 22:40:46 why’s everyone think post malone stinks, he probably smells like beard oil and money
600 2018-07-19 22:40:40 They’re talking about fish oil pills but what about When Drs were dishing out vit. D pills to all and sundry for depression?
601 2018-07-19 22:40:37 Also don't cook with avocado oil. That has killed birds. Probably should avoid cosmetics with avocado oil also.

616 2018-07-19 22:38:17 America sounds great but the culture is alien to even Brits. Russians would be far more comfortable here or in France. A rowing mate works for an oil company. This week 4 beautiful Russian  joined his office. Speak good English. They have a great complexion. Cold weather.
617 2018-07-19 22:38:15 Just gave it a good cleaning, wonder what kind of lube they lube it with at the Colt factory, Nasty Tacky? I think Uberti has been using Cosmoline. Been using Lucas gun oil lately on all mine.
618 2018-07-19 22:38:07 I wondered the same thing. It would give Putin useful naval access, close to Europe. It would also be a good place for his oil pipeline he wants to build to supply Europe.

"Did".

Convince us that your time spent as a lawyer for a Russian oil company was just a coincidence.

Convince us with words AND deeds.

Putin: Ivanka

Trump: No. She is mine. Take Alaska.

What say you?
633 2018-07-19 22:35:52 Let's say we've kicked out how many of the Russians close down how many of their offices And indictment or 12 Russians were screwing with their oil prices by producing more. And yet have an American is a bad thing maybe just maybe senator he's going to poke at putting some more
634 2018-07-19 22:35:48 More like leaking oil with other people's money
635 2018-07-19 22:35:40 I recently started taking CBD oil for anxiety- it was decently manageable until I started studying for The Thing, but then it became slightly untenable. I can't recommend CBD oil enough- an absolute miracle. I'm calm, focused and feel even-keeled. Anyone else taking it?
636 2018-07-19 22:35:05 RT @LS_Nutrition: #Safflower Oil this July? It can interact with #Anticoagulant, #Antiplatelet and other drugs. Check with your #MD!
637 2018-07-19 22:35:02 CBD Oil can really help. I always try to remember that there has ALWAYS been a light at the end of the tunnel and this does not last forever. I know that it’s hard but it has really helped me stay somewhat stable.

You can't put your economy as a whole into a rainy day fund and you CAN make a rainy day fund even if your economy is tied to oil, so there's no interpretation of this statement which makes sense.

709 2018-07-19 22:25:13 There’s too many kinds of external hard drives I feel like I’m like those people that call their dad when they’re getting their oil changed and the dude says they need like 40 other things jdhshshshhs
710 2018-07-19 22:25:06 For whatever reason?  Read my lips (as oil magnet George Bush Sr once said);  MONEY.  There is money being made...and the rest is just window dressing.

715 2018-07-19 22:24:36 We are better than South America, we are way too better than Asia.

The hole world depends on us, we supply you with Oil, we supply you with Gold
716 2018-07-19 22:24:34 It is really strange, there is Odessa, TX & Odessa, Ukraine. Both are oil rich. Ukraine's Odessa is much larger. US oil & gas families helped install Ukraine gov't in 2014 after CIA coup. They installed Texas gov't long ago.
717 2018-07-19 22:24:31 I wonder if Putin is using Trump to finesse some energy deals to bail Russia  out their oil linked recession.  Isn't that why Orange Menace started whining about OPEC, to help his oligarch buddy?
718 2018-07-19 22:24:19 And the cost would be a drop in the bucket compared to coal/oil/gas , maybe that’s why we’ve been programmed to fear it? 
719 2018-07-19 22:24:09 You wouldn’t bring your car to a dentist for an oil change. Garoppolo knows what he’s looking for decided to go to an expert.

721 2018-07-19 22:23:49 I think it’s easier going from watercolor to oil than the other way round.    You need a lot of discipline with edges and values in watercolor which translates well to oil.
722 2018-07-19 22:23:27 I think the best option surely would be a visit to site and cake, I mean come on,combine the two and make it an occasion!

725 2018-07-19 22:22:58 Actually, ISIS grew because Saddam Huisein was executed.  I won't get into the oil debate with you.  The company I work is a major player in the oil/energy sector and the info I have won't make sense to you and others not in the know. #ProudCanadian
726 2018-07-19 22:22:38 I am curious what impact this study will have on the amount of fish oil that is prescribed and recommended by doctors to reduce heart disease.

730 2018-07-19 22:21:39 Putin wants to arm Ukrainian Nazis to attack Putin? Putin wants to sabotage Russian oil interests in Europe? Putin wants to arm ISIS in Syria to take down Putin's key Middle Eastern ally? I'm not sure this is a coherent narrative. #tytlive

733 2018-07-19 22:21:07 Putin put Trump in office to have hi remove  Russian embargoes, weaken EU, USA  and NATO. Plus to have private oil business  that required  Exxon's CEO  Tillerson to handle  oil deal.  This is why Trump nixed  
Paris Climate accord. Trump - Putin are monetizing their offices

It doesn't involve a negligible amount of soap. :|

More or less sums it up.
772 2018-07-19 22:17:20 but if you link the role of  world military leader to the ability to influence or get cheap oil, i am sure you will get thru to those thick headed isolationists who love big trucks . Tell them the choice is between driving a sedan or be a world leader, they'll get it really

778 2018-07-19 22:16:46 The problem is not whether you are Keto or Vegan. The real problem is Plant Oils. Soybean, Canola, Corn, hydrogenated, partially hydrogenated. In my experience Coconut Oil and Olive Oil are handled well by our bodies. Those other Oils are the real killers.
779 2018-07-19 22:16:45 El marble soap te ayuda con las manchas pero creo que necesitas un topical treatment mas “targeted” para el hyper pigmentation. El cleansing oil es chévere, especialmente para hacer double cleaning con el jabón después. Ambos tiene buenos ratings y reviews.
780 2018-07-19 22:16:45 Oil and gas is not rapidly disappearing. That is a bold faced lie.
781 2018-07-19 22:16:44 Penny auctions are hysterical... Just having some fun bidding on ugly oil paintings priced in thousands, jewelry that aint real but high priced, and handmade goods priced in the thousands, like handbags, leather pet beds and stools..

783 2018-07-19 22:16:15 Is such a unique oil!! We love  
784 2018-07-19 22:16:11 I think it was NDTV, among others, who ridiculed decades back the Ganesha drinking milk story....probably olive oil is 'secular'?
785 2018-07-19 22:16:02 baby oil works great.
786 2018-07-19 22:15:58 Largest consumer of oil?  Compared to US consumption, it's 1.1%.  We don't have 800 bases. We have far less than you think. The count is based on government ownership of 10 acres or more even if no soldier is situated there.  Most of them are in Italy, Germany, Japan, SK, and UK.
787 2018-07-19 22:15:55 Yeah.

Besides, like, nearly everything I cook is *intensely* seasoned. No reason to use anything better than plain old decent oil.

831 2018-07-19 22:09:37 Think U'll find it=Russia who got rid of ISIS.

832 2018-07-19 22:09:32 Look, I'm not saying oil companies aren't sleazy. But it's the same as any industry. You put a tax on a product, and companies will 100% of the time pass the increased costs onto their consumers so that their bottom line isn't affected.

847 2018-07-19 22:06:32 Let me make it simple for you. Malama amina ki fito takara mu zabe ki so you can bring about the change you desire
848 2018-07-19 22:06:28 The Democrats weren’t just supporting but expanding NATO! And the US was keeping oil prices down! It’s production was up! Trade barriers were down but not with Russia! And wouldn’t you know it, Putin figured out that Russians are white and Christian! Natural allies of US bigots.
849 2018-07-19 22:06:04 Shit molly had 140 and ate oil like a bitch lol

852 2018-07-19 22:05:44 #WellIfIWereYou..I would give me money to go on vacation, tell me what a wonderful person I am & join me on my essential oil bandwagon!
853 2018-07-19 22:05:40 Absolutely..I just can't smoke it. But I wish I could get the oil for nerve pain.

1) For this oil slick.

Thank-you lord,
4) For the loaded gun.
5) For the bad aim.
6) For I'm lonesome.
858 2018-07-19 22:05:15 did u know that when u eat greasy food the oil separates from the food in your stomach and just sits in a layer on top of everything
859 2018-07-19 22:05:02 4 hour wait to get uh oil change...HA!

862 2018-07-19 22:04:20 Took my @Toyota Corolla into the dealership to be serviced for my free 25K mile tire rotation, and @LakeShoreToyota went ahead and included the free 20K mile oil change which I had forgotten about. Their staff is always extremely friendly! #thankyou #customerservice #toyota
863 2018-07-19 22:04:05 Did that secondary sanctions relief free up millions if not billions of dollars of revenue for Iran? Yes.  They were able to ship our far more barrels of oil after the sanctions were lifted.
864 2018-07-19 22:03:47 Who is everyone? Oil companies that want to destroy the land? Mining companies that permently destroy habitat? Or whoever is tasked with building the ridulous wall that crosses protected lands? Because it’s not the average American
865 2018-07-19 22:03:33 Wow - I guess everyone in the world is lying except for Trump. If you can’t see that he’s the biggest shyster and snake oil salesman in the world you haven’t been watching the show. The greatest steaks in the mail? And that combover that isn’t one? #wakeup Take your blinders off

869 2018-07-19 22:02:54 She has been in the system starting from the time of Obj down to Gej and buhari. So she can tell us better if it will be a failed project or not. The only time we can get thing right is when oil money stops coming, I bet you we will reason even better than the white guys.

871 2018-07-19 22:02:26 Funny thing is that it's not the color of olive oil but apparently, upon testing, is olive oil nonetheless with perfume. This being the Catholic Church, they'd eat it solemnly with flavorless wafers.

877 2018-07-19 22:01:45 Why are those assumed to be separable things? They both trace back to and revolve around oil and gas in a fundamental way. At least post-cold war. And maybe even before.
878 2018-07-19 22:01:44 Too lazy to drive, didn’t do my oil change, and When I said day I wanted to be over there by 1230-1 PM .

882 2018-07-19 22:01:11 Epicentre is at russ hill, a stones throw away from horsehill oil exploration site where they claim to their investors they resumed activity on 27 July. @eagleradio new monitoring units now installed at horsehill and russ hill.

884 2018-07-19 22:01:00 Tracy Ford hired some dumb ass mother fuckers. I made an appointment at 1 fucking 30 and told them I'd be back because I went to the gym. Came back at 3 and they still haven't done my oil change.
885 2018-07-19 22:00:50 There are ladies and losers, ladies should steer clear from this show. Oil and water doesn't mix.

887 2018-07-19 22:00:33 To be quite honest Shooter many ppl who actual bet real money have absolutely no idea the concept of $$$ MANAGEMENT.  Even smart oil businessmen have no damn clue which is why guys are still going BANKRUPT.

892 2018-07-19 21:59:56 おきてー
893 2018-07-19 21:59:52 I've heard that it often is olive oil as a base, and balsam is at least one if the things that makes it smell.
894 2018-07-19 21:59:28 I don't like being able to detect any sugar in a marinara sauce. 

I should taste garlic, olive oil, a possible range of fresh herbs and black pepper.
895 2018-07-19 21:59:20 Damn, CBD oil is amazing
896 2018-07-19 21:59:19 I just had to pay $250 for two new tires and an oil change. I’m suppose to be saving money. 
897 2018-07-19 21:59:16 there r a lot of essential oil oriented pyramid schemes basically but i also have to take in consideration the fact that i love when i associate ppl with a certain smell and would like to also be associated w certain smells
898 2018-07-19 21:59:16 use it for Oil stains in your Driveway, use it for other things and donate it
899 2018-07-19 21:59:05 First of all, I don’t live in Denver or Boulder so get your facts straight. I’m not against oil and gas workers. I’m against the industry placing Industrial Megapads next to our schools, playgrounds and thousands of homes. Do you live next to one?
900 2018-07-19 21:58:56 Yes, I read The Emperor Wears No Clothes by Jack Herer. The cannabis and hemp history is an education. An education in the usefulness of cannabis and hemp, and in the criminal lengths corporations will go to to eliminate competition.  Especially when oil is involved.
901 2018-07-19 21:58:54 Use any oil, or something based on oil.
902 2018-07-19 21:58:54 Hmm. So, real " Fake" News.

  Olive oil isn't cheap. Anyone bring pasta?
903 2018-07-19 21:58:27 We're honored to work with our partners, @IntBirdRescue and @TMMC to help save wildlife affected by oil. Thanks for your kind words and for joining us today! #DawnWildlife40

906 2018-07-19 21:58:11 There is & always has been one feasible solution to CO2 emissions, and that is nuclear power. Anybody who believes otherwise is a naive idealist fool. Environmentalists' anti-science fear campaign against it for decades has been worse for the planet than the oil companies.
907 2018-07-19 21:58:02 Oil seal goes engine race's out of control. If in gear it over powers brakes. 
Driver keeps trying to stop it.

If this happens to anyone get it out of gear into nutural. The engine will blow even with ignition off. It's running on engine oil.
908 2018-07-19 21:58:01 next time try oil like corn or olive
909 2018-07-19 21:57:59 My anxiety spikes to almost peak levels whenever I get an oil change and drive over those open pits... mainly because I have an irrational fear of falling in and embarrassing myself in front of all the good-looking mechanics.
910 2018-07-19 21:57:52 Can someone take my car to get an oil change and gas?
911 2018-07-19 21:57:39 Buh seriously we sud be putting red oil on your head every morning

- carnivore
- high oil (mct/coconut)
- high dairy
- meat + veggies (high fiber)
- meat + berries
- vegan keto

I am sure there would be huge differences in satiety and ad lib intake.

920 2018-07-19 21:56:01 Blair was all character and very little substance, and quite a few political leaders of late have emulated him. I don’t think a snake oil sales rep will unseat Trump - very clear political goals and how to achieve it will 
921 2018-07-19 21:56:00 Now our economy is the best it’s been in decades and still they badmouth him. They are starting to talk about recession—not going to happen when the economy is growing in all areas of employment, wages, oil and sales. That might mean inflation, but not recession.

927 2018-07-19 21:54:22 Thank you! But... it does matter. We’re investing the money we won from football, not oil money, and we’re not breaking the Financial Fair Play. 
928 2018-07-19 21:54:08 If the UK stop interfering and stops supporting Muslimbrotherhood maybe Libya will be stable ! But know this is that Benghazi will never be ruled by Tripoli these days are gone ! Most of the oil is in the east that fought  by sides the Uk in ww2 ! No central gov !
929 2018-07-19 21:53:59 Hello. I'm a wrench noob. I recently changed the spark plugs on my wife's 2010 Focus and there was some oil or something pooled up around the old ones that spilled into the combustion chamber when I pulled them out. When I went to start it up, I got some white smoke. Is that bad?
930 2018-07-19 21:53:40 What is she being fraudulent about exactly? The tone & bent to her post aside is she saying anything that is untrue? The DOD is the largest consumer of oil & we do have more foreign bases than the rest of the world. I need to math D1 & I'll give you D3 b/c it's conjecture
931 2018-07-19 21:53:35 There must be coal, oil, or some natural resource that trump wants to exploit within their habitat ... trump doesn’t have the depth to understand the repercussions of this action.

936 2018-07-19 21:52:29 I'm proud Russell & Sara had the guts to get out & actually take extreme measures to raise awareness over oil and it's destruction of the planet. 
So many critics, who've never done anything but type a few tweets from the safety of their armchairs - big men - small dicks

939 2018-07-19 21:52:06 A power engineer friend of mine claims proudly that he once unintentionally nearly shut down one of Australia's oil refineries. The shutdown sequence was caught but apparently a lot of alarms sounded.

941 2018-07-19 21:52:04 It is different when you are geographically part of the same small island where there is no significant cultural, political or philosophical differences between its people. As for North Sea oil, it's operating at a loss and all we'd get now is 100% of a minus figure. No sell.
942 2018-07-19 21:52:03 Dear Lord, how does anyone take drops of cbd oil without retching???
943 2018-07-19 21:52:02 The pressure is not there we could be losing the coast lines right now and the car manufactures and oil companies simply would not give a fuck. It's not costing them anything but million dollar houses  meanwhile they're banking billions.

953 2018-07-19 21:50:29 I don't understand this country. We have millions of cows, 90% of our milk is imported, we all agree we should be exporting processed meat & dairy.
We should be refining and exporting our oil

We are the most travelled in Africa; why is having an International airline a bad idea?
954 2018-07-19 21:50:17 The love oil sounds fascinating

958 2018-07-19 21:50:04 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.

975 2018-07-19 21:48:54 cbd oil is an absolute life saver, I swear - the amount of pain and discomfort that it takes away from me with one wee drop is absolutely incredible.
976 2018-07-19 21:48:45 There is the "good" part the Don is banking on. Common enemy of Muslim. (It's really about the oil)

978 2018-07-19 21:48:43 Peppermint tea or oil is amazing. Hope it gets better.
979 2018-07-19 21:48:41 We're not going to get economy of scale is long as people see the coal and oil reserves as money in the bank with no associated costs that effect the bottom line.
980 2018-07-19 21:48:36 I'm proud of the B Mobile. It got me to and from work the last few days. It scared when it randomly shut off on Tuesday, but he did the job. Now to get him over for an oil change and check up tomorrow

987 2018-07-19 21:47:39 I hope not! One of the best things about driving an EV initially, was a sort of pleasure in not having to pay money to large oil companies who’ve profited on years of environmental exploitation (I wasn’t too chuffed at the BP / Polar acquisition!).
988 2018-07-19 21:46:53 So...why have you never blocked any of the 4000+ foreign oil tankers bringing oil into Canada on the East coast each year?
989 2018-07-19 21:46:51 My GP has 2 nurses with fibromyalgia.  They both take the  cbd oil for the pain. He said it works great for them both. Before that they could only work 3 hrs a day. Now it's all day. But they pay around $400 for one month supply and it isn't covered by any insurance.
990 2018-07-19 21:46:35 This black castor oil & flax seed eco gel really laid my edges  like I’m shook
991 2018-07-19 21:46:31 Oil industry employs far more than that, but certainly doesn’t make the east any more accepting of Alberta crude. Even though it would make it far cheaper for them. Which is the complete opposite of the propped up dairy cartel. So .... there’s that.
992 2018-07-19 21:46:31 Everyone is always talking about recession..yield curve just makes an easy talking point ..it’s a rotation between late cycle, the yield curve and oil
993 2018-07-19 21:46:23 That was her 1st session as Governor, but a bad economy (hangover from oil/gas crash, S&L crisis), the Lt Gov (Bullock), and the courts (school & prison lawsuits; also mental health) deserve more of the credit for the legislature doing anything on the revenue side.
994 2018-07-19 21:46:16 If olive oil is from olives and peanut oil is from peanuts where does baby oil come from
995 2018-07-19 21:46:14 weed makes it worse for me because i use to smoke a lot but now ... nope i do want to try cbd oil tho because i heard it helps anxiety.
996 2018-07-19 21:46:09 So...why have you never blocked any of the 4000+ foreign oil tankers bringing oil into Canada on the East coast each year?
997 2018-07-19 21:46:08 Yes a listed financial market lacking high tech firms and dominated by oil and mining. 
Pro Brexit and not investing in FTSE not incompatible
998 2018-07-19 21:45:55 I tired everything on here but castor oil.
999 2018-07-19 21:45:45 I want to say so badly “they’re vegan!” To convince.. but they’re sugar and oil all the same LOL
Happy pride, stranger!!! 
1000 2018-07-19 21:45:43 Got so much baby oil & Vaseline on my good sheets  (while shooting)
1001 2018-07-19 21:45:37 You showed me a bottle of your favorite oil there. I asked how much it was. It was roughly $50. I said holy shit and walked away. Love you.
1002 2018-07-19 21:45:36 Some dude complaining to an automobile company which are still building cars that use gasoline.  I am working in an oil and gas company and I want the world to depend on them as many years as they can so that I can still be at work. Please.
1003 2018-07-19 21:45:34 Because the leaders make money off stock investments in oil companies... they don't care about Utah!

1007 2018-07-19 21:44:57 The Husky at Hwy 5 / Halston is down to 135.9 - the big oil companies are taking time passing along the savings... #Kamloops
1008 2018-07-19 21:44:56 explain to me how using Greek yogurt vs. sour cream is anything other than pure branding 

(I love them both from the bottom of my Eastern European heart - THEY ARE VERY SIMILAR) 

or point me to the essay on rebranded food (butter vs coconut oil, and on and on)
1009 2018-07-19 21:44:41 Liverpool have spent £172M this summer & £125M of that is the Coutinho money , do they have oil money , certainly no imao ..

1012 2018-07-19 21:44:15 Today I had work at 8 am and then went to the gym and made myself a healthy dinner and I’m honestly thriving! But I also got olive oil on my work shirt so you win some you lose some I guess
1013 2018-07-19 21:44:06 Using peppermint oil to help a headache is really cool until you accidentally get some in your eye and go blind for the next 15 minutes
1014 2018-07-19 21:43:58 Demonizing "radicals" like @SierraClub isn't helping energy workers find jobs or new training & the warmth of your hate isn't a solution either.

BTW -you're attacking a group that predates the wide use of oil or gas. Perhaps your energies would be better directed else where?
1015 2018-07-19 21:43:48 I cannot read this essay oo
1016 2018-07-19 21:43:43 I grew up in Rye, and loved the Marsh. My Dad was an oil painter, and he used to seek out all the tiny chapels and churches and paint them.

1021 2018-07-19 21:43:27 Literally anywhere that says oil change, unless you have a luxury car you wanna be careful on where you go. look up the nearest jiffy lube, they’re usually really good and quick. Prices aren’t bad either
1022 2018-07-19 21:43:04 According to this article, more oil and gas exploration.
1023 2018-07-19 21:43:04 Is there actually a supplement out there that helps with weight loss when combined with exercise? Or are they all snake oil?
1024 2018-07-19 21:42:43 Except just a few years later oil prices are rising & went above $70 a barrel. But no one I know bases their desire for Scotland to be a normal independent nation, on the existence of oil in Scottish waters.
1025 2018-07-19 21:42:19 I want to know what Gary is taking.
Is it by any chance cannabis oil, I hear it does many great things to help. Especially in the head.

1045 2018-07-19 21:39:45 Carbon tax is a smaller percentage in the cost of gas than what the oil companies make though. This is quickly boiling down to "taxes are expensive" - one could easily counteract any gas tax by lowering income taxes, or make income taxes less onerous for those with lower income.
1046 2018-07-19 21:39:44 God Will NOT Hold You Accountable For Oil He Did Not Give you... Stop Trying To Compete 
1047 2018-07-19 21:39:39 @MSNBC We ignored a US President consorting with the largest axis of evil. Making deals with a Nation that never fufilled UN demands. When Russia pledged to provide the US with all of it's oil needs in support in retaliating for 9/11 & a shared space program.

1056 2018-07-19 21:37:37 Hope they are good at shooting around oil jacks. And strip mines
1057 2018-07-19 21:37:36 On a budget? If you aren't buying meat and cheese substitutes for every meal, all the essentials are cheap. 15+ dollars on a steak? you can get more protein, less unhealthy shit, and more iron from a 40 cent can of beans. And with some oil, starch, and seasoning, beans taste lit
1058 2018-07-19 21:37:26 Both pieces of bread was PERFECTLY toasted. And the olive oil makes the bread have a light crunch to it, whereas regular fattening butter adds that harsh crunch!
1059 2018-07-19 21:37:25 How is this suddenly about oil companies? I don't care if they make money or not. I'm talking about people. Individuals. I'm not saying "Cut the carbon tax so that oil companies make record profits again"

I'm saying "Cut the carbon tax so gas is fucking affordable again"
1060 2018-07-19 21:37:18 Haven't had anything quite like it, but a french fry cutter, sichuan peppercorn oil, Asian cumin, and dried red chiles would be a good place to start.

1070 2018-07-19 21:36:05 They put on 11K MW new ones for the same reason , LNG and Coal Based , unit price was approx. 5 rs PU , furnace oil would have been very bad idea , about 6K MW is hydro , and 5K MW you are right about that . Solar , issue is per MW Installation cost is high. We r a poor Cntry .

One of their former DJ outed it
1086 2018-07-19 21:34:10 How come gas prices are so high? Do the laws of supply and demand not translate to oil?  I'm a little confused about this?

1103 2018-07-19 21:31:58 Either punish adult individuals monetarily now or punish children physically later - climate change is a very real and serious danger. The oil companies just slurp up profits and then...??? What are they doing to make life better?
1104 2018-07-19 21:31:52 George Bush Jr or his advisors were smart enough to know the American people would cut ties with all of the Middle East and call for his death which is why we needed him out. We keep Bin Laden we lose fuck tons of oil, the United States Econ runs on Oil.

1115 2018-07-19 21:30:06 I think the terms #Trump and #intellectual mix as well as oil and water.
1116 2018-07-19 21:30:05 Sorry for the potential 2x tweet. There are still billions of $ exchanged between America & Russia for oil. That matters as we continue to increase the trade war and push tariffs on our allies such as Mexico and Canada, who as you point out are critical oil importers
1117 2018-07-19 21:29:37 Says the snake oil salesman who continuously tries to fear people into consuming his bullshit!
1118 2018-07-19 21:29:29 $1,190 will be the low for AU. Take out the stops at $1.200 and then the banksters will let commodities run. Strong AU, AG, CU and ZN rally. Oil and gas will likely rally, too. Agree w/ Tord, two to three month rally.
1119 2018-07-19 21:29:22 Drugs mixed with oil being sold via a TV evangelist?

2: STOP DIGGING YOU STRUCK OIL!!!
1122 2018-07-19 21:29:12 After you and the #UsefulIdiot gut the Endangered Species Act for the oil and logging industries, you can sell hunting tags for say bald eagles, spotted owls. You guys are truly taking us back 100 years. Can't wait till your gone. Hope Earth can wait that long. Mother is crying!
1123 2018-07-19 21:29:00 I understand.  Abe is now changing things for the better in this regard.
Like with most raw materials, Japan requires massive oil imports --- Recall WWII casus belli, even --- and no doubt Iran has been offering them a very attractive price.
1124 2018-07-19 21:28:51 No one calls them beacons of democracy and funds them to the tune of billions despite their transgressions of international law. And yet despite trumps Muslim ban the US still embraces Saudi Arabia despit it being a sponsor of global terror and, erm, a huge exporter of oil,

1128 2018-07-19 21:28:34 Must be a nightmare!! Pretty sure those mean check engine, battery, and oil (and obviously seatbelts), but might be worth checking your car’s manual. Hopefully it’s nothing serious
1129 2018-07-19 21:28:30 Sorry but the natural supplement/natural medicine craze is mostly just scams. They're legally allowed to be deceptive in their advertising that is designed to look like legitimate scientific studies. THEY ALSO HAVE NO LEGAL REASON TO PROVIDE YOU WITH ANYTHING BUT SNAKE OIL.

1132 2018-07-19 21:28:18 Not sure our MSP's are that great either. Indyref #1 finances were based on oil revenues going up. Not 6 months after, they plummeted. Had we been indy, we'd have been in the myre.

1138 2018-07-19 21:27:39 A) they did not run out of money. Oil markets tanked and they hadn’t calibrated their revenue streams to handle a downturn

B) it wasn’t simply the presence of social programs that tanked the economy/gov. Social programs are inexpensive. Corruption was largely to blame.

1157 2018-07-19 21:25:31 Still there are billions spent on Russian oil. Not as much a s other countries agreed. But consider this ... the trade war and tariffs we are pushing on Mexico, Canada etc. pushes us towards more dependency on Russia.  

And that's the point...

1273 2018-07-19 21:07:35 in ancient times, it wouldve taken a lot of scarce labor to produce a little bit of crude petroleum. However, petroleum would not necessarily have been a scarce resource at the time because there was virtually no demand for that type of oil.
1274 2018-07-19 21:07:34 My favourite oil has to be the peace as it just takes the edge off anxiety and stress for me or cheer to uplift my mood if it is in the morning.

1366 2018-07-19 20:52:41 Yeah, I did a little googling and discovered that chrism is essentially a perfumed oil.

1369 2018-07-19 20:52:26 I hope he is. We would have an economic boom. no dopey climate schemes, no carbon taxes, a chance to get the oil industry moving that Trudeau has pretty much buried. And a hope that our open borders would quickly close to illegals.

1389 2018-07-19 20:49:47 It's not to do about animals. It's all to do about raping are national forest and parks from any oil. mining.lumber and grazing. If they have those pesky endangered animals in their way they won't be able to strip the land bare.
1390 2018-07-19 20:49:47 you know what? fuck publix. their prices are high as fuck and i can’t get an oil change, a haircut, a mani pedi, mcdonald’s/subway all in the SAME PLACE
1391 2018-07-19 20:49:39 If you're gonna put coconut oil or butter in your coffee you may want to emulsify it in a blender 1st. More palatable that way.

1397 2018-07-19 20:49:05 A nympho like @Chief_Obasanjo who slept with women before giving them contracts and oil wells that belong to the people of Niger delta is talking and calling a President with integrity 'Incompetent'? Adaka!
1398 2018-07-19 20:49:00 He only "challenged" that energy deal because he wants to sell oil to Germany himself. 
1399 2018-07-19 20:48:58 When we keep the prophets. We see Zechariah chapter 6:13 tells us BOTH share the peace as in 2 Messiah's. Both High Priest and the king of Israel received Mashach being the oil poured on the head. Therefore both Jews and Christians are right.1 was crucified and 1 is in N. America

1408 2018-07-19 20:48:11 Rich people Can afford good lawyers. That is the root of the problem in that our legal system has these snake oil salesman lawyers running around and twisting the laws to benefit the criminals. Been happening for years.
1409 2018-07-19 20:48:08 Well, I’ve now cut these on the advice of my specialist ...cumincure, turmeric, b12, cq10, gsa and fish oil. Now I just take lactobacillus, streptococcus, vit d, oregano oil, Cbd oil, monoLauren  black cohosh and matcha
1410 2018-07-19 20:48:06 Dont forget BHO's Russian appeasment when invading Ukrain too.  Gave them all the gas and oil they needed at a critical time (why they actually attacked).
1411 2018-07-19 20:48:01 I’d make courgette noodles and stir fry them in a wok with olive oil, garlic & lemon. Then I’d make rocket and walnut pesto in my Nutribullet & mix this into the courgette pasta. I’d serve it with some fresh homemade Nutribullet hummus & serve with a glass of rosé! @sniven1 
1412 2018-07-19 20:47:59 True it has caused a great deal of the outrage. However many of us were outraged at his presser, offering up Americans to be questioned, agreeing with Putin on price fixing Oil/Gas, equating morally American actions with Russia on an equal basis. Dismal performance

1419 2018-07-19 20:46:47 I haven't tried many different oils for skin. A few years ago I was so desperate that I used olive oil but that wasn't a great look for me.
1420 2018-07-19 20:46:30 People think big oil, big banks and big pharma are bad. But when’s the last time you heard someone say big tech or big unions were bad if not worse?

1422 2018-07-19 20:46:17 Russia has infiltrated America so bad and these guys can’t even see beyond their nose .

1423 2018-07-19 20:46:15 Sounds like you and I have the same problem! 
Plus it brings to light how many calories and fat are in a lot of the things I eat... Even something like just vinegar on my sandwich instead of oil AND vinegar saves about 200 calories..

Can you guys comment on NJ State Senator Rice's comments that there will be sex toys and oil in New Jersey dispensaries?  I think you have a secret fan there.
1432 2018-07-19 20:44:48 Really, it should be a felony for these trash astroturf orgs to fraudulently represent themselves as grassroots when they're all corporate. Fkn coal and oil companies afraid to shift to solar and wind, so they figure "I'll be dead before the planet is dead, f**k my descendants."
1433 2018-07-19 20:44:43 - Didn't Osinbajo say the purpose of removing subsidy was to restart our own refineries so oil products would be cheaper? Two years later, any signs? @ProfOsinbajo how're you even a pastor? Your lie na A1.
1434 2018-07-19 20:44:23 What have we got that is more important than oil to England _ WATER.
1435 2018-07-19 20:44:07 My advice:

1) Simple is still delicious (you can saute anything up with some olive oil, butter, garlic, salt & pepper)

2) added salt and butter and oil in cooking is better for you than prepared food.

3) don't worry too much about calories from fresh fruits and veggies.
1436 2018-07-19 20:44:05 What you're seeing is actually a mixture of oil and crumbs that can sometimes form during packaging and it is not peanut based. Please DM us the UPC, expiration date with the letters & numbers that follow.
1437 2018-07-19 20:43:56 This administration has been leaking oil since day one.  That is assuming the transition went well LOL

1439 2018-07-19 20:43:42 I left in 1994. As much as I recollect there were more reasons than just reforms (which coincided with lowest oil prices).  Extraordinary Criminal Revolution was one of them. "Amnesty" of the Soviet atrocities (Yeltsin let it go) rehabilitated the idea of Iron Fist ruling.

1451 2018-07-19 20:42:16 Likely institute a high tariff per barrel of oil sold down south while at the same time offering even more energy sales to China. Which is already happening. So again insulting and threatening your allies may work well within a narrow vision of domestic politics .../3

1455 2018-07-19 20:41:24 You can use a good face moisturiser add 6 to 8 drops of tea tree essential oil.
1456 2018-07-19 20:41:15 No, relative risk or playing the odds doesn’t apply when your hauling an incredible amount of flammable oil through Metro Vancouver, one of North America’s most densely populated cities. Rolling the dice isn’t appropriate for our incredibly sensitive ecosystem below all this oil.
1457 2018-07-19 20:41:03 It essentially locks in the moisture in your skin and helps build up/restores your natural collagen so it helps reduce wrinkles/lines like anti aging products. It’s good for oily skin bc your skin won’t continue to produce as much oil if your skin stays moisturized.
1458 2018-07-19 20:41:02 I need an oil change soon ima need all the fools I drive around to pitch in. I’ll send u my Venmo, thanks

1468 2018-07-19 20:39:35 Actually Spain was one of the places that I found it really hard to find anything green --- but lots of yummy seafood, ham, patatas bravas, and olive oil + bell peppers
1469 2018-07-19 20:39:33 What oils do you like? In the winter I put straight sesame oil on my skin. Depending on what you can internally handle- cuts out all those “extra” ingredients & will also work externally.
1470 2018-07-19 20:39:27 she was literally more reliable than all my phones have been if i actually changed the oil she’d probably have ran forever

1485 2018-07-19 20:37:14 well, it will stimulate that only if there are incentives, e.g. with a tax on greenhouse gases. Otherwise there are no incentives. Same with R&D on clean alternatives. It's not like we could bring down oil, coal+gas just by naming+shaming, right?
1486 2018-07-19 20:37:11 My face is producing like 4 times as much oil as it usually does and why just why @ the universe WHATS HAVE YOU GAINED

1489 2018-07-19 20:36:29 This is a good and reasonable question to ask. Additionally Venezuela was a net importer of food before socialist policies were put in place. With the fall of oil prices and the resulting failure of their economy they can't bring in those imports. These aren't simple situations.
1490 2018-07-19 20:36:21 I tell people this all the time. I will not eat at their prepared foods bar because most of it has canola oil in it, it's overpriced and most of it's not even organic. Just because it's at Whole Foods doesn't mean it's healthy. Canola is not a health food or even a food!
1491 2018-07-19 20:36:14 Exactly it's like combining water and oil. Some comparisons don't match at all.
1492 2018-07-19 20:36:13 11,000/Barrels/Day—USA Production. US workers & technology is the BEST in the business. Combine oil with gas output & one can see how far we have come in my 40 years. DIRECT well ownership available.

1500 2018-07-19 20:35:13 See, Obamas policy actually involved flying Iran a pallet of cash.  That sounds a bit more treasonous than saying weak sauce things about putin.  On top of cash, Obama also freed up Iran's economy so that they could make more money from oil shipments.
1501 2018-07-19 20:35:10 People in their 20s love whatever newest snake oil comes out every 2 weeks thinking it will fix their problems lol
1502 2018-07-19 20:35:08 The distinctive smell comes from balsam, which is mixed into the olive oil
1503 2018-07-19 20:34:51 What is confusing me is why is it that why crude oil was around $136 a barrow  we paid around R11.36 for petrol and now its $86 a barrow we are paying R15.58 and next month its going up by 17c. What is happening here. 

I think I should stop reading or I will expose people.

1511 2018-07-19 20:33:16 The real fraud is when people who used to be hired by the tobacco industry to fight regulations are then hired by oil companies to lie about climate change.  The real shame is that you believe the lies because of your tribal identity.

1517 2018-07-19 20:32:51  people should keep to their lanes. Royalty hates peasantry and the two are like water and oil. He could be rich cowwise but lacks status. Girl is at an ivy league University and already dates a tycoon's son. Maasai apambane na hali yake tu
1518 2018-07-19 20:32:46 y’all I put way too much peppermint essential oil on my chest and now my nipples are ON FIRE
1519 2018-07-19 20:32:43 @maddow revisite the oil (Putin/Trump) possible corruption connection again! Another reason for a private meeting! At a worldwide news conference #PINO the President in Name Only, goes into #TumpRally mode! #ManChild behavior #Incompetent #MrObvious
1520 2018-07-19 20:32:43 The immediate purpose of new road schemes (and other infrastructure) is to create lucrative contracts for construction companies. The longer term objective is to ensure growth in car sales and oil revenues.
1521 2018-07-19 20:32:20 I spray mine with diesel and used oil.  Keeps the mice away from wiring I think also. By the time spring comes it’s not oily
1522 2018-07-19 20:32:03 Alright all you cool homeopathic, natural remedy folks- I'm a believer of tea tree oil, CBD oil, salmon oil, blah blah blah. 
My anxiety and panic isn't fun. What's natural that I could take for help?
1523 2018-07-19 20:32:02 Selling oil to Asia @BlairKing_ca ! Don’t deflect the topic away from the reasons to support the #TMX expansion. You’re lobbying for oil tankers loaded with oil passing through Metro Vancouver and the Burrard Inlet. You’re lobbying for Big Oil, I’m protecting my City & our Coast!
1524 2018-07-19 20:31:48 No oil either 
1525 2018-07-19 20:31:47 Not as fast. 

This is, of course, all academic. Politicians will continue to subsidize oil as long as oil continues to subsidize politicians. Having a chief executive who thinks the whole thing is a Chinese hoax is an aggressive staph infection within the species.
1526 2018-07-19 20:31:45 I’ve told you countless times now I’m tired of not believe me that they did what they did to stop Africans economic prosperity and sovereignty and to control oil of Libya than do research yourself if want I’m done :)
1527 2018-07-19 20:31:22 Omg i feel that.We have people here that are doing the same thing but i love bringing up the option and when told "oh im not putting mary jane in me to get better" i love educating the fact that the oil isnt weed!Some people refuse to change with the times.
1528 2018-07-19 20:31:16 @TeawithTolkien could you ask all your priest friends what exactly is in chrism oil? Melina broke out in hives at her baptism 5 yrs ago. I was never able to find out what is in it.
1529 2018-07-19 20:31:08 Try castor oil, hair oil, and removal.

1533 2018-07-19 20:30:11 Wrap and 3 bites filed: Democrats trash Governor Rick Scott for holding a fundraiser in Oklahoma with oil and gas executives. Saint Petersburg Mayor Rick Kriseman says the governor is no friend of the environment and is still in denial over climate change. #fnnnews
1534 2018-07-19 20:30:10 Update: Oil beats unreliables every time. #CdnPoli
1535 2018-07-19 20:29:59 Need someone to oil my scalp.
1536 2018-07-19 20:29:57 I know some people say it’s snake oil but I really think Arnica creams/gels also help a bit. I use either one from Boiron and I think think they work. Also a good old hot water bottle is never a bad idea.
1537 2018-07-19 20:29:45 Did you know that historically Greek and Roman bathers would coat eachother in olive oil and then scrape eachother clean to exfoliate?
1538 2018-07-19 20:29:42 "...a seismic blasting oil ship that was trying to harm my kids and all of us by destroying the stable climate we all depend on..."

Russel mate, if you are on medication, double it, it isn't working. 
If not, see a specialist.
1539 2018-07-19 20:29:36 @FoxNews Everyone is the enemy but Putin? The same man whose moving closer to us on the Northern polar cap? The same man who wants more oil so he can ramp us his military? To go after who? Us?!! Trump needs to go!
1540 2018-07-19 20:29:34 How is Trump a puppet? You mean Putin wants someone to call fowl about the pipelines? That Russia wants NATO defense spending to increase? US to produce so much oil the Russian econ crash since it's oil based? 

The only thing keeping Russia afloat is that Venezuela oil crashed
1541 2018-07-19 20:29:25 Fact: if you cry olive oil god can get you pregnant
1542 2018-07-19 20:29:25 Sounds like cod liver oil
1543 2018-07-19 20:28:58 How do you remove oil stains from a concrete floor? Products from SA please
1544 2018-07-19 20:28:53 I’m just offering oil here let me do my business !
1545 2018-07-19 20:28:33 Good. While they're at it, somebody throw some oil dry on his face
1546 2018-07-19 20:28:24 So chemical rocket manufacturers, dark matter funded professors and oil companies r suppressing #quantisedinertia on wikipedia because it offers electric launch, gets rid of dark matter and may explain #LENR? That makes me feel better. At least it's not that they don't like me :)
1547 2018-07-19 20:28:14 Oil sands .... and if you don’t want it , don’t use it !!
1548 2018-07-19 20:28:10 Riddle me this... So vegans fight for a world that is free of animals being used for human consumption. When we stop using cows for meat and milk, chickens for meat and eggs, sheep for wool, meat, and oil, what becomes their meaning of life on the basis of biology and need?
1549 2018-07-19 20:28:07 You will see the real WM fight to keep scots resources when we vote to leave UK.
WM went to war for oil,they wont let scots walk away with thiers.
What will you be claiming then Fox?,,that oil was thiers all along?
1550 2018-07-19 20:28:06 can’t stop thinking about how much we’re like oil and water
1551 2018-07-19 20:28:06 Been trying out ways to naturally induce myself and let me tell you, your girl has tried so much shit LOL 
•raspberry leaf tea
•prenatal/acupressure massage 
•pineapples
•peppermint oil 
•dancing/walking 
•sex 
 And Nathan still has only dropped but nothing else 
1552 2018-07-19 20:28:00 Ah. It’s been a while since I cooked with it. Didn’t strike me as much worse than soy oil, just a bit weird when hot.
1553 2018-07-19 20:27:53 We could just let the oil flow back into the rivers and lakes like it did in the pre-extraction ages.
1554 2018-07-19 20:27:52 No oil so no country cares
1555 2018-07-19 20:27:50 No one defends what she has said and done, but calls for her to be boiled in oil are excessive.  A quick, painless execution should be enough.

1560 2018-07-19 20:27:30 Im getting my oil chnaged & there’s this couple literally walking around eating all the snacks they have sitting out like they are at home & idk if I envy them for being so comfortable or if I’m annoyed lol
1561 2018-07-19 20:27:28 so not at all then? Lead paint manufacturers were held responsible but big oil? Nah.
1562 2018-07-19 20:27:15 i’m like 400 miles over due for my oil change. i will not hear the end of this 
1563 2018-07-19 20:27:13 I found an oil that works wonders for my hair, and I’m gonna go buy all of them at Walmart right now. Brb.
1564 2018-07-19 20:27:12 I have my quality filter on and I still see your stuff.
1565 2018-07-19 20:26:07 Leaving it alone and keeping it moisturized has been the best for me! Olive oil is my fave oil to use
1566 2018-07-19 20:26:00 You have to basically really dry them out, use a towel and just dry them to fuck. Then toss them in cornstarch and salt and then a thin layer of oil and they’ll be crispy as fuck true
1567 2018-07-19 20:26:00 I put on "Glass Jar" after vaping an absurd amount of cannabis oil and the experience of listening to that song became so intense that I panicked and ripped off my headphones—I couldn't finish it. That's an endorsement btw.
1568 2018-07-19 20:25:52 Agreed, 600K investment didnt work out on 1981 soviet cementation.
Side track using same methods for the three oil wells to date. However much has been learned for the next Gas drill, in H1 2019.
1569 2018-07-19 20:25:52 If I remember corectly from one of her videos it’s for oil control — when I use powder before foundation it deff controls oil production

1576 2018-07-19 20:24:58 Alexandria is so incredibly beautiful? Like. I want to bring her coconuts and oil her hair.
1577 2018-07-19 20:24:57 He knows that the FED and the dollar are going lead to his undoing. The Federal government is deep in debt and higher interest rates are adding onto the enormous red ink. A weak dollar also leads to higher oil prices. Crisis ahead.

1582 2018-07-19 20:24:45 More insults @BlairKing_ca ? You’ve completely run out of any good reasons to support all this lobbying you are doing here on Twitter in support of the #TMX expansion. Lobbying for Big Oil? 

Selling oil to Asia @BlairKing_ca ! You’ve never provided any good reason for it!
1583 2018-07-19 20:24:39 And while I was cleaning up I got my oil changed, tires rotated so it’s really a GO!

it has been said that  ban on women driving might be restored (except for women of ruling family )
1585 2018-07-19 20:24:19 No I mean I still was the one to say it, I’ll own up to that and it was completely wrong. but I just didn’t realize my tweet about hair oil would really upset people so much tbh hahaha
1586 2018-07-19 20:23:53 No money means no petrol, no vaseline, no transport .......because we can't buy the oil to make these. How will we plough the plough with no diesel for tractors, no trucks or trains for delivery of goods....?And thats just the start of what we need to buy internationally
1587 2018-07-19 20:23:35 Yeh but it was snake oil

1593 2018-07-19 20:22:59 Oh his oil tycoon buddies are getting greedy. We have our own fuel reserves why don't we use it  Solar panels and wind turbines creating jobs, clean energy sources for generations to come. Keep the filth in the ground. Electric Cars are the future Powered by the Sun.
1594 2018-07-19 20:22:58 I'd visit @DonnaX_xxx  anywhere in Scotland! Aberdeen's not what it used to be since about 2015 and the downturn in oil. PS, Dundee's on the up, and I live near Glasgow

1604 2018-07-19 20:21:52 I do what I love and I love what I do... watching cars or trucks pull off that I just put new tires on or changed oil in makes me happy at the end of the day knowing I helped someone

1613 2018-07-19 20:20:45 So if the Indian Oil companies do procure more Ethanol, then expect ISMA numbers to be way off. These are based on current way of maximum sugar and less ethanol. And UP and Bihar are currently rain stressed, so who knows ? ISMA numbers have been way off for the last two years
1614 2018-07-19 20:20:41 ... How does one wash away blood + oil stains asay permanently .
1615 2018-07-19 20:20:38 Okay, so you are opposed to the oil and gas deductions then?

1617 2018-07-19 20:20:35 Rep John Boozman (R-AR) accepted $18,200 from Murphy Oil. He votes with his party 98.34% of the time.
1618 2018-07-19 20:19:59 It would be a less valid argument had not many people on the left praised Chavez so much (Podemos in Spain, Corbyn in the UK, Sanders and others in the US). Many of us saw very clearly that it was only sustainable with an ever increasing oil price.
1619 2018-07-19 20:19:52 grapeseed oil is so fire i use it for almost everything

1623 2018-07-19 20:19:16 #TeaTreeOil tip: Use it to ward off household ants and other pests! Wipe outdoor surfaces with an oil and water solution at various points of entry to make them go...anywhere else but indoors.
1624 2018-07-19 20:19:15 All I use is shampoo and conditioner and coconut oil if I can get it but that very rarely because it's got a tendency to become greasy.

1626 2018-07-19 20:18:55 True... I really would love an air fryer though. I heard they're amazing and you use little to no oil.
1627 2018-07-19 20:18:47 Week 3: youth largely ignored me in the water, perhaps out of fear of my creaking bones? Though I cherry-picked often, the ball did not often come my way and I left with no fruit to show for my labours. Sad. Will oil my joints for next week.

1629 2018-07-19 20:18:28 They acted as if oil prices would stay high forever. Chavez was criminally incompetent.

1631 2018-07-19 20:18:15 Aye, it's a great place. I plan on going into flight school and after I grad and get my licence I want to move to Oslo and do flights to oil rigs and such.

1651 2018-07-19 20:16:10 Why doesn’t he say anything to the oil companies. Gas is gotten crazy expensive!
1652 2018-07-19 20:16:01 I will say this, I am all in for oil drilling. I see fracking as our demise. I absolutely think it has to do with all the midwest earthquakes that happen more often these days. No Democrats, they are not from “global warming.”
1653 2018-07-19 20:15:53 Check your Transmission oil this Sunday.
1654 2018-07-19 20:15:49 I take fish oil for mood reasons, though I know it's good for heart health and smooth elbows and whatnot.
1655 2018-07-19 20:15:48 Sadly, to the determinant of owners, many manufacturers have and continue to publish misleading claims in their manual. Claims such as “Lifetime coolant” , “Sealed transmission, with lifetime transmission fluid” or “10,000 mile oil change interval.”
1656 2018-07-19 20:15:40 The ancient Romans used ammonia (derived from urine) and fuller's earth (a clay that can absorb grease and oil) to clean their togas. 
1657 2018-07-19 20:15:38 I am so thankful I own a company that makes lubrcating oil.robots need that why own a coffee shop,so 2017 s
1658 2018-07-19 20:15:19 So does that mean we're back to 'hidden oil fields of near-infinite size'? Or how much do you think is disappearing, unaccounted for?
1659 2018-07-19 20:15:15 #NBSFrontline #NBSUpdates this argument applies to all indirect taxes. It would be wise to reduce or eliminate these taxes given that they affect the poorest the most (like the tax on cooking oil). If we let Ugandans keep their money, their spending will drive the economy forward

1663 2018-07-19 20:14:53 Being able to have fats is a major plus, and I also find ways to satisfy my sweet tooth. My favorite is making a chocolate pudding with an avocado base, cocoa powder, coconut oil and/or heavy cream, and stevia as a sweetener..
1664 2018-07-19 20:14:27 Oil money 
1665 2018-07-19 20:14:22 Good weekend Oil&Gas customers of mine.  Crude Oil (25/06/2016): USD47.19. FF to July/18 and Word translated is still at just 12 US cents. US ph: +1(713)3703385
1666 2018-07-19 20:14:20 Ooof - I think I even had room for the ‘massage oil’ bit. Good add. I was trying to add ‘leaving a spare golden key to Trump’s chambers in the bathrobe pocket’, but not enough space.
1667 2018-07-19 20:14:20 This is water and engine oil. It doesn't correlate  at all

1671 2018-07-19 20:13:54 Finally getting my oil change and tire rotation after putting It off week after week after week after week. This one is for you baby  You deserve It.
1672 2018-07-19 20:13:48 I have to admit it made me kind of chuckle. Never ever let the government have control of anything. They will make it out of reach for most people. Taxes,taxes,taxes. I don't think this is what pot legalization advocates had in mind. I use CBD oil for pain so am concerned as well
1673 2018-07-19 20:13:48 Vegetables sautéed in coconut oil and spices are my new faves. 

It's remaining to eat them with garri.
1674 2018-07-19 20:13:42 Driveline and all its acolytes, sell hope, similar to snake oil salesman and quack doctors who prey on the gravely ill, Morally bankrupt and not a shred of good science, this exposes them, forewarned is forearmed @codball @ChoochCast

1677 2018-07-19 20:13:33 These are all verifiable lies. But look at the source...another @GOP snake oil salesman making money off the rubes that will believe him.

1680 2018-07-19 20:12:50 Anything you'd use oil for. I cook all my food in it. Tonight I'll sautee chicken, broccoli, mushrooms, and onions. And then add some chinese brown sauce for a yummy dish :3
1681 2018-07-19 20:12:37 We've tried pretty much ever method out there. We agree with a lot of her seasoning techniques, but when it comes to seasoning, we believe it's more about how/what you cook with the skillet than what oil you choose.

1688 2018-07-19 20:11:22 LOL. All depend on OIL.

1692 2018-07-19 20:11:05 You can get it with significantly higher taxes or you can get it with cost-sharing and heavy rationing. Anyone telling you you can get it for slightly higher taxes is selling you snake oil because they know you're all too eager to buy it.
1693 2018-07-19 20:11:01 JUST THE OIL CHANGE and they got it done in 15 min :-)
1694 2018-07-19 20:10:42 avocado oil is great also
1695 2018-07-19 20:10:42 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
1696 2018-07-19 20:10:42 Oil is politics. $ much less. No chance he will make it happen. And anyway the moral suasion and power of CB's is much bigger than a political man's (even if potus) desires.
1697 2018-07-19 20:10:34 Ohhhhh like Olive oil.
1698 2018-07-19 20:10:31 1 time I went to get an oil change and I was like “seriously guys that’s ALL please do nothing else I KNOW” and then I waited an hr and a half and the guy there started hitting on me and they were like hey!! Look at all the stuff you need done! And I was like NO

1701 2018-07-19 20:10:02 I'd LOVE to see research on why income inequality FELL in oil/ mineral rich Latin American countries post 2003.

There was pressure to redistribute the commodity boom.

But inequality ROSE in oil/mineral rich countries in SSA

Why wasn't there sufficient pressure to redistribute?

Guacamole on top of the scrambled eggs.....lawdy
1704 2018-07-19 20:09:29 The trick to kale consumption is dowsing it in good olive oil and salt, then sautéeing until it's bright green and has wilted away to barely nothing. Then, for good measure, hide it in a big bowl of pasta.
1705 2018-07-19 20:09:28 Yaga. Well, the girl was as I've served you, you've never poured oil on our hinges; but she was near, she gave me bacon."

1707 2018-07-19 20:09:15 Do you know why the British never made TV sets?   They couldn't figure out how to make them leak oil! :-)
1708 2018-07-19 20:09:11 Correct Number7. Amazing how these oil rich states are in need of 'liberation'.
1709 2018-07-19 20:08:55 I’m just here for the half-nekked selfies tbh.
1710 2018-07-19 20:08:50 This will keep it from rolling but it’s not a “fix”. The car is still unable to be shifted because the car is stuck in a particular gear.  This fixes nothing. It just prevents the car from rolling. It’s still undrivable when the cable bushing slips.
1711 2018-07-19 20:08:50 Love it when you go to get an oil change and leave knowing you need to throw $1000 bucks into your car 
1712 2018-07-19 20:08:45 screw the pipeline...use those 20 buses you overpaid for to transport the oil....
1713 2018-07-19 20:08:39 Yep I understand that, but is olive oil not meant to be used for cooking? There goes my bolognese recipe of 30 years so.
1714 2018-07-19 20:08:29 Who's going to buy it when there are no contracts for sales, and the cost of the product is higher than the cheap oil in the US.
1715 2018-07-19 20:08:15 The fresh oil is the daily increase of God through you. Fresh oil from heaven has always been the covenant people's ever increasing prosperity.
1716 2018-07-19 20:08:02 It's French for the cracks that appear on an oil painting as it drys and becomes rigid with age.
1717 2018-07-19 20:07:53 I wanna go to Sicily and eat bread and oil with balsamic vinegar by the sea
1718 2018-07-19 20:07:35 We ran out of oil and the oil man couldn't get through because they didn't plow our street for about a week. Thank God for the gas oven. My mother switched from oil to gas heat that summer. Funny thing is you would think people would have looted the stores, never happened
1719 2018-07-19 20:07:27 I saw one spider in my apartment two nights ago and yes I am GASSING THIS BITCH UP with peppermint oil. Spides hate mint. If you’re gonna crash my space ur gonna be UNCOMFORTABLE
1720 2018-07-19 20:07:24 It is if you fry with it! Something to do with the temperature and best time off frying with veg oil and keep the olive oil for your salad
1721 2018-07-19 20:07:22 Scotland could be a very successful prosperous wee Country. Westminster is a Stone around our necks. We are the only Country on Earth who discovered oil and got Poorer. They Stole the oil revenue and gave us a pittance.

1732 2018-07-19 20:06:20 Hope he didn't mention all the hidden oil fields scattered around Broughshane and Buckna.
1733 2018-07-19 20:06:00 The Trump Administration proposed rolling back a rule that set minimum standards for the oil & gas industry to meet when conducting drilling operations. This endangers oil workers, threatens the environment & imposes enormous potential liability on taxpayers by ignoring safety.
1734 2018-07-19 20:05:53 Use castor oil or helps them grow
1735 2018-07-19 20:05:42 Disagree. @barclaysuk please continue to fund sensible resource use, which includes oil. Don’t let the bullies manipulate you. The same bullies who used oil to arrive at your office.

1739 2018-07-19 20:05:22 #OnThisDay, 1979, 2 Greek oil tankers collide in heavy rain and fog in the #Caribbean Sea. Fires break out aboard both ships, killing 27. One, the SS Atlantic Empress, burns for a week before sinking, causing the 5th largest oil spill on record: 287K metric tonnes. #DisasterADay
1740 2018-07-19 20:05:16 At some point oil will slowly start to creep higher...Almost no spare capacity, demand continues to grow (slower or faster but it grows), supply problems everywhere, reservoir depletion and so on...
1741 2018-07-19 20:05:13 Which oil is better for cooking, grapeseed or avocado?! #healthyeating #oils #foodie
1742 2018-07-19 20:05:10 From @AccountingToday : 
"Republican Representative Carlos Curbelo from Florida, the co-chairman of the House Climate Solutions Caucus, is preparing to introduce legislation as soon as Monday that would impose a carbon tax on oil refiners, gas processors and coal miners"
1743 2018-07-19 20:05:08 Okay, good. Now stop selling oil to the US just to buy it back. Ship product to new markets. Stop IMPORTING oil from foreign countries.
1744 2018-07-19 20:04:45 If our oil finishes we'll get ahead bcos we'll start thinking.

We'd stop being complacent!
1745 2018-07-19 20:04:19 Weird to see advertisement of company that bombs middle east for oil on esports jersey :)

1747 2018-07-19 20:03:57 Folks. It is all about oil. Making an alliance to get all the oil out from under the artic. He is systematically alienating and gaslighting so that the white oil producing countries can bully OPEC.   That has to be the end game he is seeking.  Think about the strategic moves.

1754 2018-07-19 20:03:00 Look at the pan na. There's little or no oil left in it after frying
1755 2018-07-19 20:02:59 not nearly enough, reminds me! Stirfry time Anjo, ginger going on the list. Avocado oil running low, time to make a big list. Onion, red bells, need to search some ideas. U got a good stirfy formula Ms Z?
1756 2018-07-19 20:02:54 LoL, Trump simultaneously wants lower dollar & oil
1757 2018-07-19 20:02:43 And do nothing between now and then? Uncontrolled oil rig gas burn off is said to produce as much pollution as all the vehicles in France, Germany and the UK. Control these now (they are not mobile).
1758 2018-07-19 20:02:40 Oil and gas corporations have been a controlling force in government for decades. Electric cars and environmental friendly modes of transportation have been around for decades. We need control of congress for real progressive change. Tired of running the hamster wheel. Vote blue
1759 2018-07-19 20:02:39 And still US order India to stop the oil import from Iran. We can't deport illegal Bangladeshi from indian soil. We cant bring the who stole money from national bank, we can't bring the terrorists from Pakistan, we can't bring the terrorists from Malaysia. We can't deport rohogia

1762 2018-07-19 20:02:06 I think in Venezuela had actually tied their economy to oil revenue, it wouldn't be in the dumps.

Alaska relies heavily on oil revenue for our state budget.  That revenue is down right now but we're not eating our zoo animals
1763 2018-07-19 20:02:01 Jojoba oil has a long shelf life and is safe for those with sensitive skin, including babies and breastfeeding mothers. It’s noncomedogenic, so it won’t clog pores. Once refined, it has a barely perceptible scent.
1764 2018-07-19 20:02:00 thought we agreed we will only start using ration cards if the oil poured in front of the southern border doesn't catch a lit....
1765 2018-07-19 20:01:48 Sara and I have our sentencing hearing this morning in Napier court. We swam in front of a seismic blasting oil ship that was trying to harm my kids and all of us by destroying the stable climate we all depend on. Gotta fight to protect our kids from oil cos.
1766 2018-07-19 20:01:31 Rice trick. Drop a grain of rice in oil it should float began to cook if so then its hot enough. You can also do the nigga way and hide behind an obstruction while you drop your target food in the grease
1767 2018-07-19 20:01:24 whenever i see someone bald i wanna lather their head in baby oil
1768 2018-07-19 20:01:16 No, I do. My determination to work for a better world is all empty rhetoric. Fossil fuels are here to stay. And they will lead us to a Paradise just around the corner, we just haven’t burned enough oil/coal to get us there yet. Lead the way, hook up your exhaust and live forever.
1769 2018-07-19 20:01:15 Make a long term plan to decarbonize the energy sector by phasing out coal, gas and oil. Ensure compatibility of your policies and infrastructure with that long term plan, and prepare a just transition. Start taking the decarbonization of buildings, transport, industry seriously.
1770 2018-07-19 20:01:11 Get real! What do you call increased NATO funding, heavy sanctions, killing Russian mercenaries in Syria, increased oil production etc.
1771 2018-07-19 20:01:06 I have literally no idea. All started with that statue of me exuding olive oil and it’s all went to pot 
1772 2018-07-19 20:01:00 #FED works independently of  #POTUS wants & needs. #Trump knows absolutely zero about economics & even less about government. Sticking his nose into business deals, interest rates, Saudi oil flow will do damage to economic tailwinds that he was solidly “gifted” by predecessor.
1773 2018-07-19 20:01:00 Doesn’t oil need a pipeline?
1774 2018-07-19 20:00:56 Have you tried asking the olive oil people
1775 2018-07-19 20:00:52 It is worth getting an idea of scale - we now seem to be down at 4% for WTO from the original 10.3 govt and then around 5% for IMF. The rise in the oil price between 2003-7 was calculated to have lowered UK gdp by a similar amount. Negative but maybe less significant than claimed
1776 2018-07-19 20:00:46 my aunt dropped oil on the floor and apparently that means somebody is gonna die i love italian superstitions

1791 2018-07-19 19:58:59 Oh and always moisturize your hair. Mix water with a natural oil in a spray bottle and spray your hair DAILY!! Seal with a thicker oil or butter like castor oil or shea butter and wrap it up in a SATIN scarf. Thank me later
1792 2018-07-19 19:58:48 This at least makes sense... whether one agrees with it or not. #oil
1793 2018-07-19 19:58:41 O ganne go dira ka oil yela ya meriri mo
1794 2018-07-19 19:58:40 Actually he has been if you look at what he's done. Supplied increased arms to the Ukraine. Beefed up NATO's military spending. Opened up vast Federal lands to increase our oil production. Told Angela Merkal to buy American National Gas instead of Russian gas. I could go on
1795 2018-07-19 19:58:39 This is perfect 
1796 2018-07-19 19:58:36 Someone smells like a dead goat marinated in oil & vinegar in here.
I hope it's not me. . .
1797 2018-07-19 19:58:26 we make enough oil to sustain our country thanks to Trump. no worries here.....we have enought oil forever. go to hell china and russia
1798 2018-07-19 19:58:22 So what is the GOP afraid of?????????
1799 2018-07-19 19:58:19 Trump's comments on Montenegro further creates questions about what he promised. I think he expects Putin to release more oil.  He is woefully out of his element in the diplomatic world. And his NATO rhetoric is dangerous. Anyone who thinks Ukraine was endgame is naive
1800 2018-07-19 19:58:15 @elonmusk is a real life super hero kinda like Batman, concocting ways to defeat the evil oil lords and take us all to Mars.
1801 2018-07-19 19:58:10 "They want to do to Libya what they did to Iraq and what they are itching to do to Iran. They want to take the oil." - Gaddafi, 1942 - 2011.
1802 2018-07-19 19:58:05 *slaps roof of my Subaru* 

“This baby can burn so much fuckin oil”
1803 2018-07-19 19:58:04 @Veet_UK have tried Facebook messaging you, which you have read and ignored. I used your wax strips and have asked for help in removing the heap of wax left on my legs that no amount of oil will remove.... shan't be using again and won't be recommending. ta!
1804 2018-07-19 19:58:01 Clear Castor oil or Jamaican oil
1805 2018-07-19 19:57:57 For me it's an oil in water kind of situation 
1806 2018-07-19 19:57:45 Spray da boy head like oil sheen 
1807 2018-07-19 19:57:44 Oil & gas, my friend, oil & gas.
1808 2018-07-19 19:57:40 No there are EVs fuelled purely home solar right now. No coal, gas or oil at all. You can’t fuel your #FCEV at home that way.
1809 2018-07-19 19:57:39 Went for an oil change and in a surprising twist also had to spend over $400 replacing my front brakes and rotors! HOWS YOUR DAY GOING?? 
1810 2018-07-19 19:57:36 Sir, I'm sorry your car takes 0w20 oil.  I'm sorry I cannot change our prices for you.  I'm sorry, but if I put any other kind of oil it'll void your warranty on your engine.  I'm just doing my job....  and sir! Thank you for shopping at Walmart.
1811 2018-07-19 19:57:33 Fracking causes earthquakes & pollution is causing extreme natural disasters around the . Ayanna Pressley will fight Big Oil to make fossil fuels a thing of the past. We have the technology to power America with wind & water. Why do we keep choosing oil?
1812 2018-07-19 19:57:28 Does anyone oil pull?
1813 2018-07-19 19:57:27 My husband massages his toe cuticles with jojoba oil (pronounced ho-ho-ba, apparently) and essential oil of himalayan yak’s testes, twice a week. Seems very froo-froo to me and he’s spending my money on it, but I guess a man with scaly feet IS a turnoff.
1814 2018-07-19 19:57:24 @rachaelray made macaroni and cheese on her show today. The only difference is that she added bacon, truffle/truffle oil, garlic, parsley and chives.

1816 2018-07-19 19:56:58 When I say maintenance, I mean like fuel pump, carbon buildup, turbos, injectors, one time replacement shit that they need when they get older, I don't mean oil and shit.

1818 2018-07-19 19:56:56 Olive oil or animal fat only
1819 2018-07-19 19:56:21 Oil change all bills paid 
1820 2018-07-19 19:55:52 ok all had a oil change today a little kid changed my oil in on my car this sounds gay but you all know am in raj and jhon gasy died
1821 2018-07-19 19:55:50 Looks like he got that Wonder bread bag and olive oil treatment.
1822 2018-07-19 19:55:48 I’m saying resale from a private owner with aged battery, not refurbished. Also, your synthetic motor oil figures seem to be consistently high. An oil change is $30-60, 2-4 times a year.
1823 2018-07-19 19:55:45 He wants lower rates, a lower dollar and lower oil. i know he's used to getting what he wants but this is probably not going to happen. just one chimps opinion.......... #fantasyland 
1824 2018-07-19 19:55:37 Dude stopped me and said, “Man look my girl sent me out here lookin for some peppermint oil ..” Like Wtf are you a witch or somethin??!”
1825 2018-07-19 19:55:34 The only thing Russia has is gas and oil. Trump told Germany to stop buying gas from Russia. Told Europe to fund NATO. Nato to protect Europe from Russia. Germany is giving Putin billions of dollars.
1826 2018-07-19 19:55:30 If you're a guy and don't know how to do an oil change on ur own car u a bitch
1827 2018-07-19 19:55:27 anybody on my timeline love cooking?

question: what method, in your opinion, works best when testing oil to make sure it's hot enough to fry with?
1828 2018-07-19 19:55:10 Ok, do you have eggs or milk? To wet the meat, ? If no, just pound the meat and cover the meat in the dry ingredients. Get a pan of oil, make sure it's hot as fuck b4 U put meat in.. when it looks like it's golden brown,, turn and put on a plate to drain oils.
1829 2018-07-19 19:55:04 congratulations!
1830 2018-07-19 19:54:52 Browder explained in book deputy prime minister of Russia offered chunk of Sidanco oil at prices “cheap beyond belief.” He described deal as “a home run.” other players in Sidanco tried to squeeze Browder out, Russian Securities and Exchange Commission stepped in to save him.
1831 2018-07-19 19:54:46 I don't berate those with zero choice, far from it. I berate the oil industry & car makers for foisting dirty diesels on people and I agree regarding price, although they're much cheaper to run. I still argue that oil extraction, burnt once, is worse than Li-ion, recyclable

1833 2018-07-19 19:54:38 Oh, misguided @seanspicer your buddy, #TraitorTrump looked like a spanked by #Putin puppy, ashamedly trotting out before t/press after their private meeting. This so called president & t/rest of you have been selling snake oil & real patriots in America aren't buying it n e more.
1834 2018-07-19 19:54:34 I apply it to brows and lashes before going to bed and it helped me to grow them thicker and stronger, I've been using it for about 5 months now. I mixed castor oil and olive oil because castor oil is very thick
1835 2018-07-19 19:54:24 Tip: substitute 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce for 1/2 cup oil while baking
1836 2018-07-19 19:54:23 "sorry i can't eat there, they use peanut oil"
1837 2018-07-19 19:54:23 I've found that the Field Roast sausages arent too dry if you cook them on the stove top in a pan with a little bit of olive oil. I love the tofurky ones, but I will admit they are a bit on the dry side.
1838 2018-07-19 19:54:18 In order to keep OPEC in check, the Fed. Introduced Iraq dollar which was to facilitate oil trade. This was after killing SADDAM.
1839 2018-07-19 19:53:59 Me and older churchy black women are like oil and water. Chile you can’t pray everything away.
1840 2018-07-19 19:53:41 That castor oil bruh
1841 2018-07-19 19:53:31 No more oil spots on the floor

1843 2018-07-19 19:53:23 haha, no drinking this one, it's an oil infusion - it will make a good massage oil for pain though! It is a beautiful colour, isn't it?! 
1844 2018-07-19 19:53:10 Whale Oil Beef Hooked #GIVEAWAYTIME
1845 2018-07-19 19:53:10 Knowing this, do you believe we actually get more money than you basing our entire economy on oil?
1846 2018-07-19 19:53:10 Bringing oil in from Venezuela and Saudi Arabia... sooo much safer AND for bonus points you know the people of those countries are treated with respect from their leaders 
1847 2018-07-19 19:52:53 Gotta agree with Mr. Shapiro, it is unusual that after a summit with Russia (especially) that US officials do not come out and tout what was accomplished at the summit. Its clear why they are not doing it, Trump's presser; Oil/Gas price fixing, IC, interview swap, all absurd
1848 2018-07-19 19:52:44 stick some olive oil works a treat
1849 2018-07-19 19:52:43 Do very large #oil derivatives trades typically reference barrels or notional value?
1850 2018-07-19 19:52:42 What you fail to understand, is that none of that matters. What matters is the fact that we have oil tankers sailing through Metro Vancouver and the Burrard Inket, loaded with toxic and flammable sludge. You’re lobbying for this, including 7X’s more tankers with the #TMX. Why?
1851 2018-07-19 19:52:41 I’m your elder, simply try to stop you buying snake oil.
1852 2018-07-19 19:52:32 Do you keep your peanuts and olive oil in the fridge as well?
1853 2018-07-19 19:52:11 Renewable energy produced in southern Europe can move Europe from oil and gas.  Electric cars and phase out of gas with induction cooking and heat pumps.  Reducing reliance on the nice man in the Kremlin.  Win for Sth Europe and North EU.
1854 2018-07-19 19:51:39 Only you even though i said the same thing in my head like who uses baby oil gel for hair
1855 2018-07-19 19:51:37 Le tenian que poner un motor revolucionario y ahora dicen que de Gas Oil.

1857 2018-07-19 19:51:14 Olive oil. Sounds stupid but rub that in and it'll soften them up and make your skin like a baby's
1858 2018-07-19 19:51:06 You must be sick, figthing corruption by the dp is like oil and water
1859 2018-07-19 19:50:50 Well, I'm sorry to inform you, but a dollar is worth 5000000 BsF. That's a little more than our minimum wage (if I'm not mistaken). How much do you actually think a barrel of oil is worth here in Venezuela? Let me answer it for you: it's worth a big pile of nothing 
1860 2018-07-19 19:50:50 Rapeseed oil.
1861 2018-07-19 19:50:45 You have to expect Trump to be coordinating his tweets tom with the CNBC interview viewing Trump wants the $$$ lower and will try his best to make it happen tom morning don't forget what happened with oil...

1867 2018-07-19 19:49:39 Neither is "true friend" so India can't buckle under US pressure

Far more terror money comes from Saudi vs from Iran yet US never criticize Saudi due to petrodollar. Shia in India  usually less radical as well. 

Best if no ME oil at all but that's not reality.
1868 2018-07-19 19:49:30 tea tree oil and aloe are the best things to ever happen to my skin. Holy cannoli

1877 2018-07-19 19:48:28 A couple mother fuckers are putting drops of olive oil on a statue's face in New Mexico and telling people it's statue tears. Just once I'd like to hear that a militia group formed as an angry response to shit like this.

1879 2018-07-19 19:48:18 Personally love this. It's someone's choice to spend money on cigarettes, not my choice to inhale said smoke while walking down the sidewalk.
Arguing because it's taxed is garbage, it's taxed because it hinders healthcare.
As for weed...I mean CBD oil is where it's at.
1880 2018-07-19 19:48:07 My guy you said rich? skshjkjkjhh ok I have an oil feild at my back yard just come and get it.

1889 2018-07-19 19:47:17 8% of the U.S. GDP comes from oil and natural gas while that’s not insignificant it’s not nearly as high as Venezuela was.
1890 2018-07-19 19:47:01 Capobia essential oil on the gums is supposed to help!
1891 2018-07-19 19:46:52 Also. Archdiocese of Las Cruces is investigating.  Found no tampering with the statue itself or building. Says weeping statues before have wept olive oil. This one supposedly has a rose scent. Can t wait to go!!!
1892 2018-07-19 19:46:49 $60 for an oil change life is unfair
1893 2018-07-19 19:46:37 HMRC says they don't attribute rig to tanker oil to Scotland so how are the taxes attributed correctly?
1894 2018-07-19 19:46:25 Do you have any Epson Salts? Baking Soda? Clary Sage Essential Oil?
if so, take a soak for as long as 40 -60 min. (1 cups ea. 17 drops EO)
1895 2018-07-19 19:46:24 I want to make this, but what is considered good olive oil?
1896 2018-07-19 19:46:23 I couldn’t figure out when the lid of the oil bottle wasn’t fitting onto the saucepan!
1897 2018-07-19 19:46:08 Would you recommend olive oil then?

1902 2018-07-19 19:45:50 Yes, yes, that’s quite correct I was on the sidecar of my mate Phil’s, eh motorcycle, we hit an oil patch and, boof that was it, it came away, and a shat maself
1903 2018-07-19 19:45:42 I know this lazy as hell not changing my own oil right now but I haven’t bought the 3 ton home jack yet
1904 2018-07-19 19:45:36 Lol, I dont want to know the current crude oil price and I'm not ready to start any statistical arguement with you because head dey pain me. What I know is that kerosene at 250naira is very very expensive. period
1905 2018-07-19 19:45:25 U be snorting lavender oil 
1906 2018-07-19 19:45:24 I do what i can in my own backyard, I think we need to reduce our dependency on oil and invest in less polluting forms of energy, I know it will not happen overnight and understand that we still need oil and gas as we reduce our use of it
1907 2018-07-19 19:45:22 I totally agree, and how many people buy cosmetics and soaps containing palm oil which causes such damage. Calling it sustainable palm oil is rubbish. We all must try harder. Basically ppl make a noise about it all but do not follow through.
1908 2018-07-19 19:45:21 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!

1915 2018-07-19 19:44:35 Perhaps because the west needs Israel to control the oil in the mid east. Except Iran, Israel has all Arab countries of mid east under their boots.

Do women in America still get genitally mutalated at birth?

1926 2018-07-19 19:42:52 Fran Sinclair, over it. (Also did they name the Sinclair family after Sinclair oil... woof)
1927 2018-07-19 19:42:48 The meat industry has surpassed the oil industry as the #1 cause of pollution so theres that. But nobody wanna stop eating their hamburgers do they. Fuck humanity man. We have the power to change we just dont.
1928 2018-07-19 19:42:48 Their looking for the witch doctors that can call lightning from the sky and oil from a stone obviously
1929 2018-07-19 19:42:48 F4i to do list.

- adjust clip-ons

Bout to be a busy week ahead for the bike. 
1930 2018-07-19 19:42:42 Oil is the energy of the 20th Century. Renewables are the energy of the 21st.  We have enough plastic pollution to deal with. We don’t need to deal with oil spills too.
1931 2018-07-19 19:42:29 im telling you putting coconut oil in your hair will change your life & ruin all ur clothes (but for real my hair is so soft)
1932 2018-07-19 19:42:21 your mans making bank he either in the drug game or in the oil industry
1933 2018-07-19 19:42:19 Where do you get all of these charts?! 

Do you subscribe to "Charts R Us" !?!
1934 2018-07-19 19:42:15 Fried chicken but with almond flour and coconut oil
1935 2018-07-19 19:42:00 Let's see if it needs an oil change every six months, that's 42K a year.

42K / 365 is $115 a day.  

What is could you sell for $115 a day to afford the oil changes?

Oh wait, there's gas too?
1936 2018-07-19 19:41:52 No. Only countries that are based on socialist and communist economies. The USA also bases lots of their revenue on the oil industry, and yet you people don't have to work a whole month to earn a minimum wage and STILL NOT BEING ABLE TO BUY GROCERIES.
1937 2018-07-19 19:41:47 Take it out of the trillions in oil revenue that have trickled down to Westminster over the last 50 years.
1938 2018-07-19 19:41:36 I got coconut oil stains on the booty part of my dress 
1939 2018-07-19 19:41:27 Apparently my car had zero (0) oil in it so my timing belt broke so I need yet ANOTHER engine.
1940 2018-07-19 19:41:24 Have you ever lived on an oil field? My parents left me on one for a few months and it was quite pleasant!
1941 2018-07-19 19:40:43 But it's ok that #oil and #natgas are funding you
1942 2018-07-19 19:40:37 This one falls under money. If he unprotects land then his big oil business friends can start drilling there.
1943 2018-07-19 19:40:27 All the oil and mining companies who want to rape and pillage those protected areas!!
1944 2018-07-19 19:40:23 A 38 year old just told me she retired from the oil and gas industry to hit the pole again cause she wants to come and go as she pleases?
1945 2018-07-19 19:40:20 Also the reason Zim ran out of petrol/ oil
1946 2018-07-19 19:40:10 ブレーキランプ5回点滅、ごま油のサイン。
1947 2018-07-19 19:40:04 Family Nutrition: #Pringles Cheddar Cheese this July? With less than 2% actual Cheddar Cheese, it has more salt, oil or MSG!
1948 2018-07-19 19:39:52 Oatmeal bath. Cbd oil. Hydrocortisone. Sleep and snacks 
1949 2018-07-19 19:39:48 As we old bikers say .... if it ain't leaking oil, it ain't a real bike.
1950 2018-07-19 19:39:37 do you think he’s sweating from all that yelling or does he oil up before the video? 
1951 2018-07-19 19:39:34 *bans straws but is chill with crude oil pipelines and drift netting*

*can't figure out why earth is still trying to burn off humankind like a nasty wart*
1952 2018-07-19 19:39:23 Even Wray knows China is a real threat but let's waste time complaining about Russia, if military is strong and US is pumping oil and gas we do not have to be openly aggressive towards Russia
1953 2018-07-19 19:39:08 Cheers for the oil! 
1954 2018-07-19 19:39:05 So a lady dropped her car off for an oil change and went to work so I took one of the rental cars to go pick her up and after we get back she says, "it's so nice being able to talk to a person as young as you, most of the kids now seem so bashful."  Stop being dicks yall.
1955 2018-07-19 19:39:04 Took the family to my parents’ for a few weeks to escape the heat. Now I say things like suntan oil, gin ricky, and dutchman
1956 2018-07-19 19:39:02 My jeep is gonna get some tires 

3 yeas later 60k miles later
Needs it

Get my feet and eyebrows done 
Pray I can fit in an oil change
1957 2018-07-19 19:38:53 Damnnnnn your brakes bad ? Sucks for you $500 sprinkle a lil $180 oil change too for more flavor when your electronic key goes bad and you gotta pay $680
1958 2018-07-19 19:38:34 Will this be the usual Conservative level of economic planning? 1) Cut taxes. 2) Wait until government finances almost recover. 3) Repeat. I'm 51 and I've not yet seen a conservative government of any stripe genuinely balance a year-over-year budget.
1959 2018-07-19 19:38:26 Russian developed plasma- pulse fracking and gas/oil pipelines were probably high on the list. Russian oligarchs own the US/Canadian large pipeline factories, through Roman Abramovich's, EVRAZ NA. Roman also has the US/Canadian plasma-pulse patents. There's billions in play here.
1960 2018-07-19 19:38:25 Try CBD oil it's very good for anxiety
1961 2018-07-19 19:38:25 Only 900 billion, that's it?
1962 2018-07-19 19:38:24 Kind of sad that only major party alternative is demonstrably worse in this regard.
1963 2018-07-19 19:38:21 #ISaveMoneyBy using cooking oil instead of lube
1964 2018-07-19 19:38:15 nah dude he thinks bc I’m a girl I won’t know at least when my car needs an oil change
1965 2018-07-19 19:37:59 I’ll sort you out if you give me 20 mins and some baby oil
1966 2018-07-19 19:37:58 It's called Buycott.  I think you then have to put 'palm oil' in somehow (my son did it for me!)
1967 2018-07-19 19:37:55 But by the looks of things I will have to say that things right now remain steady. It will be interesting to see if oil reserves have changed in North America.
1968 2018-07-19 19:37:46 some guy I used to know worked on an oil rig and said the guys on the rig would eat their bananas sideways because eating them from the end was ‘gay’
1969 2018-07-19 19:37:15 Castor oil works like magic! I pulled my lashes out with an eyelash curler would use castor oil overnight my lashes grew back longer and thicker
1970 2018-07-19 19:37:12 #WhatIThoughtWhenIWas18 having my shoe upside brings bad luck. Sneezing meant someone was thinking about me. Being cold outside makes you sick. Cooking oil on the stove cooled down while cooking if I entered the kitchen bc I was the oldest son 
1971 2018-07-19 19:37:11 a hot oil treatment is muuuch needed tbh. also thinking I might cornrow the front to minimise the weight!
1972 2018-07-19 19:36:48 I understand but when talking about Venezuela look at all the other countries that their economies are based off of oil revenue lots of them end up like that
1973 2018-07-19 19:36:41 Will you change the oil on it for the winner, Doug? LOL!
1974 2018-07-19 19:36:35 Probably a dumbass question but Do I need a broker to invest in MJ and/or CBD Oil?! @MarijuanaStock_ @Best_MJStock
1975 2018-07-19 19:36:32 Yes,I test drove one but turned off by the real price and the backlog,honestly aside from oil changes my Honda/Toyota need near zero maintenance
1976 2018-07-19 19:36:26 I think, like with everything else involving the Trump family, it comes down to money. Either Trump is “owned” by the oligarchs or Russian organized crime because of his debts, and/or he stands to make a fortune from them (remember the $500B oil deal still in stasis).
1977 2018-07-19 19:36:18 Sweet,

1980 2018-07-19 19:35:41 Hey, look, it's not leaking oil all over the ground! Amazing!
1981 2018-07-19 19:35:39 Sure, they had their reasons to work with the Pentagon, namely attack by ISIS flush with Gulf/American $, weapons and even training.

They turned from defending their home to conquering oil fields with US air support.
1982 2018-07-19 19:35:29 I’m a Colorado Native. I don’t want our federal lands like Rocky Mountain National Park sold to private oil and gas drilling operations. I don’t want @GOP throwing kids in cages, I don’t want fracking everywhere. I’m not a liberal, but NO to you! #GOP has gone toooooo far.
1983 2018-07-19 19:35:28 Safety Specialists with the refinery and oil field
1984 2018-07-19 19:35:26 The chocolate olive oil cake? That’s another fantastic recipe 
1985 2018-07-19 19:35:17 @CBCNews why doesn't the federal government buildva refinery to refine the oil and help lower the cost of gas ?
1986 2018-07-19 19:35:15 They need to use technology that can sniff out gunpowder and gun oil residue at borders. Most guns are coming in through containers, truckers, native reserves that are on the border and personal vehicles. CBS cannot check every vehicle or container. $500 gun in US is $4000 here.
1987 2018-07-19 19:35:00 Yay oil companies !
1988 2018-07-19 19:34:56 Some dab oil will take that right off. hehe good luck Lee
1989 2018-07-19 19:34:35 Where do you get the vitamin e oil???
1990 2018-07-19 19:34:19 So it goes faster but leaks oil and the head gasket is made of porcelain? 
1991 2018-07-19 19:34:15 Haha. Trying to flush the black stuff out with soap now so I can put water filter back on and go. Still not sure what caused it. Not oil cooler, doesn’t seem to be exhaust manifold.  
1992 2018-07-19 19:34:13 Only if oil is involved.
1993 2018-07-19 19:33:52 Wow! I can’t wait for my millions to come in from the Nigerian Oil Minister.
1994 2018-07-19 19:33:52 Yes I have! You have to rinse the yolk with water to get the whites off, and take the “sack” off the yolk. I like to mix mine with some honey and a few drops of rosemary essential oil with it. And no I don’t wash or condition before or after. I use it to literally wash my hair
1995 2018-07-19 19:33:35 Yes buddy cause pulling your big bad pocket knife on me will surely accelerate time and make the cars in front go faster and make your oil change less than 30 mins.
1996 2018-07-19 19:33:12 There is no substitute for meeting the team (who happen to be ex Tullow Oil) who are managing your investment. Met Brian and co twice now and thats why im heavily invested here.  Each time i meet them there are new assets to discuss. #UOG delivery to date exceptional
1997 2018-07-19 19:33:08 @Barclays #StopPipelinesTar sands are a climate disaster! The oil from tar sands is twice as carbon intensive as most crude oil, doing twice as much damage to our climate #StopPipelines @Barclays

2002 2018-07-19 19:32:24 she overtight (not a virgin). After 2hr of laborious digging without penetration  and man can't carry over after 8months of seeking. So I used engine oil. Formed it was a lubricant my sister (who is a nurse) gave me. She still doesn't know till date.
2003 2018-07-19 19:32:20 But I put entirely too much Jamaican castor oil on my scalp and I just don’t have the energy to deal with this right now 
2004 2018-07-19 19:32:16 Did you know that the only maintenance you will need on a Tesla is changing tires and battery coolant?  Gas car makers sells you car cheap and gets you on 30K, 60K, 90K, oil/fluid change ... etc. over life of the car.  Real reason why gas car makers and dealers dislke Tesla.
2005 2018-07-19 19:31:41 Kicked off in the Coseley Tavern tonight when fans of 14th century artist Donatello  clashed with supporters of Jan Van Eyck over who was the first to popularise oil paint. Coseley, Capital of Black Country Culture aye it.
2006 2018-07-19 19:31:41 “I didn’t know it started raining already!”
My hair isn’t wet... that’s just coconut oil. 

2007 2018-07-19 19:31:41 Hey @Wendys your ronkonkoma NY store is a shit show got a chicken sandwich and looked like a hockey puck fried up in some 10w30 motor oil..get your shit together cause you sure charge enough for your food
2008 2018-07-19 19:31:24 Funny that it is called "vegetable" oil when it is really seed oil. Maybe the creators thought, "vegetables are healthy so people using vegetable oil will think they are being healthy."
2009 2018-07-19 19:31:18 My bet is some sort of pump with hidden faucets in the eyes and an olive oil reservoir.... The church will do anything to convince it's sheep of miracles.
2010 2018-07-19 19:31:08 My oil fin heater triggers so many people in my house - and for various reasons. I always look at it and wonder what I could have done different for it to not be in the shape it’s in.
2011 2018-07-19 19:31:07 coconut oil saves lives
2012 2018-07-19 19:31:02 Gotta get my oil changed tomorrow morning and get my car washed.... this adult shit is way too much
2013 2018-07-19 19:30:52 Mechanic just told me "your car is in excellent shape" after paying oil change + tire rotation bare minimum. Is this real life?

2016 2018-07-19 19:30:09 If your face is oily don't load it up with pressed powder which will block your pores and produce oil and acne! Soak up oil with tissue.
2017 2018-07-19 19:30:05 proud girl moment hehe just took my car to get an oil change and tires rotated all by mi self

2029 2018-07-19 19:28:56 Dirty oil? Guess you don’t care about moral ethics?
2030 2018-07-19 19:28:55 You are criminals. You shouldn’t get any money for  any of your hotels. Treasonous family you all are. Move to Russia with your oil deal. But wait. They would just send you to Siberia.
2031 2018-07-19 19:28:50 @TorontoStar   Most news media in the US are worried what Don Trump gave to Putin,  I'm just as worried about what Putin gave Trump. Maybe he'll team up with  Trump to look for oil in the arctic for example.  For sure he agreed to help him win the next election.

2036 2018-07-19 19:28:07 Olive oil is the best!!!
2037 2018-07-19 19:28:06 Your warm soapy water isn't going to sterilze your wound. If you insist on homeopathic remedies, honey forms a natural bandaid when it dries out. It has antimicrobial properties, it inhibits growth. You could use real medicine and not get sepsis. Liquor works too, tree oil no
2038 2018-07-19 19:28:03 Brb let me go pick up my oil pan
2039 2018-07-19 19:27:20 Why would a Russian agent tell Germany not to buy Russian oil via the pipeline?
2040 2018-07-19 19:27:02 Simple ...

CBD Oil good

THC  very very bad
2041 2018-07-19 19:26:58 Using Jamaican Black Castor Oil. I’m trying to be consistent with it 
2042 2018-07-19 19:26:54 "Don't judge BANANA FISH anime becaue it has the yaoi tag."

NO. IT'S NEVER TAGGED AS YAOI. WHEN WILL YOU ALL LEARN?! IT MAKES ME WANT TO STUFF YOU ALL ON AN OIL DRUM AND THROW YOU DEEP ON A RIVER.
2043 2018-07-19 19:26:51 Looks like almost all of it is from cellulosic heating oil. Surprised the EV isn't higher, but I'm not super familiar w/ the technology from either of the companies registered.
2044 2018-07-19 19:26:37 It doesn’t mention that the price California pays for oil on the pacific is a lot higher than what America pays for oil that is trapped on land. China drives up the price of all pacific crude. Does that make sense?
2045 2018-07-19 19:26:26 BREAKING: New York City's Climate Suit Against Big Oil Thrown Out

2046 2018-07-19 19:26:22 just pot some oil on it ;) it will be gone soon enough
2047 2018-07-19 19:26:13 How so? By demolishing Isis, protecting R borders,creating jobs,lowest unemployment for blacks, Latinos,giving us tax cuts, exposing corrupt politicians?Working for no salary,wanting countries to stop ripping us off,building up military,opening up oil?wake up
2048 2018-07-19 19:26:11 Russia is now a dog who can bark ,that’s about all,all they have is oil!
2049 2018-07-19 19:26:00 So what? They will just keep getting bigger and bigger til they don’t. Doesn’t mean it makes sense on a business basis.Has happened many times before with oil , tech, etc.
2050 2018-07-19 19:25:47 Wow I always get bamboozled getting oil changes too cause they think I don’t know shit and they’re right
2051 2018-07-19 19:25:41 New battery, new alternator, new brakes front and back, and a oil change.. she road ready now! 
2052 2018-07-19 19:25:25 Again, health insurance isn't insurance, so good riddance. Do you not have insurance on your car? Do you get reimbursed for oil changes and have a co-pay when you go see a mechanic? It's comical how stupid it is.
2053 2018-07-19 19:25:20 Oil change done now time to go spend more money
2054 2018-07-19 19:25:16 fucking value yourself do stuff for yourself FUCKING GIVE YOURSELF A GIFT EVERYDAY BECAUSE THE ENERGY YOU MANIFEST IN YOURSELF WILL ATTRACT THAT SIMILAR ENERGY SO REMEMBER DON'T ACT LIKE A DICK
2055 2018-07-19 19:25:05 Already happening: Oil, Natural Gas, Water, Power, and numerous other resources. Harper f’d us and Trudeau is too damn busy with the opposition to thwart consequences. Canadian Sovereignty is in peril....
2056 2018-07-19 19:24:59 Get rid of them so that the oil and mining companies can trash the land and make more money.  I keep saying this over and over, that is all he cares about, the sooner his cult realise he couldn't give a crap about them, unless he can make money from them, the better!
2057 2018-07-19 19:24:50 The hard core Trumpers are like the desperately sick who buy from snake oil salesmen.They believe this joker will turn the clock back to 1954 when uneducated unskilled white guys could get decent jobs in factories & coal mines, when people of color & women knew their place.
2058 2018-07-19 19:24:43 OSR has to be a minimum of 9% moisture for it to be collected without incurring any penalty charges. Below 6% and it gives the crushers problems extracting the oil, so most processors will not accept it. A difficult requirement to meet this year with crops being so very dry
2059 2018-07-19 19:24:37 Wow at that cheap price. It could relocate to the new La la Land in Greeley Colorado, where nothing is real but OIL AND GRASS..
2060 2018-07-19 19:24:16 He was chest deep into the oil and gas industry, which Putin and a lot of his cronies are getting most of their income. They liked having an inside guy in that office. Problem being that @realDonaldTrump ‘s guys are so crooked they don’t last long in office.
2061 2018-07-19 19:24:05 Not to be rude, but I would love to your body shiny from coconut oil or something. Whew...

2066 2018-07-19 19:23:21 Fascinating and eye opening radio feature on @bbcworldservice just now how the British government interfered in the Iran to have access to the oil and to control the country. @crimesofbrits
2067 2018-07-19 19:22:52 Why do you need cream and cheese on pasta when we have olive oil, mushrooms, garlic, parsley and spinach? Yum!
2068 2018-07-19 19:22:50 Na. You can find wood-fired wings at a place like Brixx. Most pizza is probably fine (I avoid the big chains tho, but for different reasons).

A good Mediterranean place will usually use EVOO, just make sure they don't use vegetable oil in hummus. You just need to be careful.
2069 2018-07-19 19:22:34 @Q101hitmusic. #StevenNissan. Definitely need a oil change. Single mother struggling
2070 2018-07-19 19:22:10 Alltid när jag lyssnar på program om Historia inser jag hur lite jag vet. Skäms lite då. Nu BBC History om turerna mellan England-Iran och oljan. Som vanligt alltså: Follow the oil.

2073 2018-07-19 19:22:00 Loving the commentary Gav! Stuck here on a oil rig with shit internet so can’t stream the game!
2074 2018-07-19 19:21:57 I came for an oil change at 1:50.... I’m still here
2075 2018-07-19 19:21:55 Of course it’s more than oil. It’s natural gas, again this admin hasn’t been very amicable to it. They aren’t promoting renewables. Of course we can blame Obama for Crimea, but that doesn’t change fact that Russia sent missiles there. And were is your counter point to RU IN Syria
2076 2018-07-19 19:21:54 Why then do you import oil from Saudi?
2077 2018-07-19 19:21:53 I’m sure plastic straws is the reason why the Earth is failing. Just forget about the whole oil dependency let’s just make sure we use the paper straws
2078 2018-07-19 19:21:53 A Bugatti oil change cost $21,000

2080 2018-07-19 19:21:46 will she eat wet cat food?  beebs refuses to eat anything but kibbles EXCEPT the lickable treats puree.  wet food should help!  a bit of olive oil in her food could work too.  or stick some vaseline on her paw so she licks it off (this is fine as long as it's not a regular thing)
2081 2018-07-19 19:21:40 But they are busy stealing oil from Arab states
2082 2018-07-19 19:21:36 Bro like imagine getting the news of me passing over some dumb shit like that lol. “Yea he was doing an oil change didn’t use jack stands and well here we are may he RIP” 
2083 2018-07-19 19:21:33 Prayers and love sent. I hope someone's helping him with alternative med pain relief.. Tumeric, cbd oil, copaiba oil, etc..kratom, medical marijuana, many things can help that aren't yet illegal or over regulated.
2084 2018-07-19 19:21:29 VistaLife CBD oil Testimony 
My testimony for psoriasis.  After 10-12 days with CBD Oil from Vistalife.  3 times a day rubbed in topically and 2-3 drops orally.  Pic 1 is start pic 2 is...well...AWESOME!
2085 2018-07-19 19:21:25 Your graphic shows it doubled under Obama, dropped when Trump took office and just increased again to 2015 levels and some. Nothing to do with Trump or Republicans, just oil price increase and technology. Stop the BS, Trump is still crazy and destroying our country
2086 2018-07-19 19:21:19 it's a lie because well, you may have one million cows pooping organic stuff but one spilled oil gallon will pollute a million gallons of water, the real environment damage is not from organic but human processed sources... and that cow poo goes to fertilize vegan farms anyway
2087 2018-07-19 19:21:07 Are you sure he wasn’t talking about cooking oil? Chip fat? Recycling it or something? 
2088 2018-07-19 19:20:51 Wow. Massive investment to save the planet as well as reduce spending on Oil
2089 2018-07-19 19:20:27 Jo kerosene oil py chalti hn

2091 2018-07-19 19:20:22 I love the way coconut oil makes my hair feel
2092 2018-07-19 19:20:14 yes!  so I had my aunt take my car cause I can’t go on the property and they still have her waiting for a baby ass oil change.

2096 2018-07-19 19:19:55 Me and my mom keep forgetting to buy cooking oil 

We’re on day four of going to the store and forgetting to buy it
2097 2018-07-19 19:19:42 olive oil or sun tan oil?
2098 2018-07-19 19:19:14 Big E is for the kids? That’s the guy all up in the camera rubbing baby oil in his titties during promos for no reason whatsoever right?
2099 2018-07-19 19:19:10 General Mills, who own Betty Crocker, global commitment for the top 10 sourcing is to be sustainably sourced by 2020 on our 10 main ingredients category. The first category that has achieved this commitment is palm oil with 100% responsible sourcing reached in 2015.
2100 2018-07-19 19:19:09 Oh please  I am talking about the parts of the Ukraine that Obama didn't allow to fall into Russian hands. And you obviously don't know anything about US energy production. As I said it is much more than oil
2101 2018-07-19 19:19:08 Dulu aku kena cacar dibalurin parutan jagung biar cepet kering, kalo bekasnya karena kulitku termasuk lama buat ilangin bekas ya agak lama :"

2106 2018-07-19 19:18:45 I mean, BC has $.47/litre gas taxes (depending on the pump cost, certainly this has exceeded 40%) and I don’t think anyone is concerned about the oil and gas industry making money...
2107 2018-07-19 19:18:34 Not weird at all. I saute broccoli in olive oil, usually with garlic, over a high heat just so I can get those little, charred, crunchy bits at the flower end. Yum.
2108 2018-07-19 19:18:30 9 years ago an acquaintance diagnosed with stage3 heptocellular liver cancer.

Of cohort of 20, he the only one still alive, in remission, and his liver repairing the scars from cancer
2109 2018-07-19 19:18:21 Losing a few people for the good of big oil is ok.
2110 2018-07-19 19:18:16 Yeah but how do you explain "we rigged a statue to cry olive oil with the flip of a switch so we can simulate a miracle"
2111 2018-07-19 19:18:13 Thanks. Not *too* virtuous with all the cheese and oil, but tastier for it!
2112 2018-07-19 19:17:59 I didn't, but I was tempted - snagged some Jason + the Argan Oil and Jungle bars for my hair and my ol' go to Sandstone, but I think next time that blue wonder is coming back for a good scrubbin'. thanks for making rad (less-package heavy) products, and for employing rockstars!
2113 2018-07-19 19:17:55 1) If you're not one of the 1%, why is that a concern?

2) You say that like only rich people pay taxes.

3) Venezuela's issues weren't "socialism":  It was "Put all their eggs in the 'Oil Money' basket".
2114 2018-07-19 19:17:51 Boil until very slowly to serve, place the substitute cheap enough more economical method renders tough ends, head of oil.

2116 2018-07-19 19:17:39 oil is going to 20 dollars in the next 2 years
2117 2018-07-19 19:17:31 Americans have fought hard not to allow oil to be the trading currency instead they want the dollar.
The fear of loosing value and world dominance
2118 2018-07-19 19:17:29 How much money does Crying Chucky have in Russian oil?

So much dirt to dig up on these leftists.

That’s why Trump is such a threat.
2119 2018-07-19 19:17:28 So oil will continue to suck our blood ?
2120 2018-07-19 19:17:19 "Oh i can't afford this oil change can you give it for freeeeeeeeeee"
2121 2018-07-19 19:16:51 Thing is we have no need to ally ourselves with Russia.  Their economy is a wreck as usual.  They mainly have gas/oil. Trump has a personal financial need to make Putin and his Russian backers allies. Sanctions were working to destabilize Putin hold on power.
2122 2018-07-19 19:16:47 No leaves is the key  All crunch, feta & oil. Had a bit of a problem with Greek salads at one point. Moved on to Caesar.

2135 2018-07-19 19:15:49 When it comes to providing high quality and specialist healthcare to  remote communities or industries such as mining or oil extraction mobile  units can be the answer.

2140 2018-07-19 19:15:28 @POTUS I'm afraid HRC meant a "strong Russia with NATO puppets" — not Putin. Clinton/Bush/Obama and Hillary were REALLY GOOD at overthrowing leaders (except Assad!) and killing countless innocents. To get oil. Using terrorism. Against even American citizens. #PutinStoodUpToAll 
2141 2018-07-19 19:15:18 Why don’t the use desalination plants like they do in most other oil rich countries
2142 2018-07-19 19:15:15 because it is oil money dude.. u must not be reading up on where Abramovich earned his money... ages as in since the league cup? yeah sure. boils down to the spend on the team. now with Jurgen we have spent well. so not too long. Cheers mate.. 
2143 2018-07-19 19:15:11 I'm old enough to remember "Bush lied, people died", "War for oil", and the 9-11 truth movement from the left and libertarian right. I won't criticise being skeptical towards intel agencies, but I will criticize the left, who now thinks that intel agencies MUST be believed.
2144 2018-07-19 19:15:01 I just heard we, Texas will become the largest oil producer in the world.
2145 2018-07-19 19:14:57 Bringing up Venezuela to fear monger about socialism only shows that you haven't spent any time actually researching the issues you use to try to ridicule others. It only takes a cursory look at Venezuela's economy (90% dependent on oil) and US's gratuitous economic sanctions.

2149 2018-07-19 19:14:40 So Ivanka #Trump is introducing a government program to help retrain Americans for new trades. This sounds suspiciously like #Hillary's claim that people in employment of crumbling job markets (coal, oil, etc.) need to learn new skills during the campaign. More plagiarism?

2152 2018-07-19 19:14:21 Bro yeah, fucked my bumper and now I’m leaking oil. Called the company. The GM said “we don’t carry shovels on our trailers.” THEY’RE A LANDSCAPING COMPANY!
2153 2018-07-19 19:14:18 You think a former KGB Agent who is the leader of Russia who can't be arrested or tried is afraid of a Special Prosecutor in US? That is the definition of crazy. The Magnitsky Act is an irritation, but Russia will every barrel of oil every bit of natural gas they can produce.
2154 2018-07-19 19:14:14 Will post it. Missed a bid on $OIL however I think it still comes back down to clip it. Will post it shortly. Had a busy day trading today.
2155 2018-07-19 19:14:09 I recommend leaving mashed avocado and coconut oil to soak into your beard for a couple of hours. It means I see people two evenings a week, but it wouldn't be fair on my wife for her friends to think she married a man who doesn't take care of his appearance for her.

2158 2018-07-19 19:13:54 Tried a new recipe last night!!! Essentially I took my fav veggies, tossed them in olive oil, sprinkled them with with sea salt, baked them at 425, forgot to use an oven mit, dropped the entire pan, iced my hand, and ate oatmeal instead 
2159 2018-07-19 19:13:41 I mix like ten drops of the almond with one or two drops of lavender/clary sage and apply it like that. Almond is quite a good carrier oil for applying straight to your skin and you end up feeling all moisturised too haha  silver linings and all!
2160 2018-07-19 19:13:38 How about grapeseed oil?
2161 2018-07-19 19:13:21 Emily is a  truck mechanic that likes Olive oil on their mushroom pizza with white wine
2162 2018-07-19 19:13:15 The Baghdad Restaurant and Bakery on Evers and Wurtzbach is really really great. Their Turkish coffee, flatbread with Zaatar spiced olive oil, and kebobs are awesome. They are still a too well-kept secret and should be so much busier.
2163 2018-07-19 19:12:51 The financial press drives me batty. Instead of saying OPEC "eased back on output cuts" why not say OPEC 'will not pump more oil.' Saying they will ease back on a promised cut for planned output is a lot more confusing. Just say they aren't increasing oil supply. #simple
2164 2018-07-19 19:12:50 Everytime I get an oil change somebody's Grandma shooting her shot..Bless they heart but i want your Granddaughter
2165 2018-07-19 19:12:42 Yes, we need very high oil prices.
I'd prefer a vary high carbon tax, who would allow to finance an efficient energy transition.
Not the inefficient one we are in.
2166 2018-07-19 19:12:39 Yeah I am you gotta get on that peanut butter and coconut oil grind

2171 2018-07-19 19:12:17 Nigeria like Ghana are British brothers in crime. Suffering same fate.Those ruling them are never for the good of the citizens.Only there to protect their colonial masters interest in the oil and minerals resources they invested in the country.The messiahs are never as they say.
2172 2018-07-19 19:12:04 tip: use coconut oil to make popcorn- it’s an absolute game changer, but don’t use too much!

2176 2018-07-19 19:11:44 @JaneMayerNYer With all this Russian connection to Republicans in the news of late (especially with Wisconsin Rs where Kochs have done well), don't your bios of the Kochs indicate the initial origin of their wealth: oil drilling for the Soviets? Another article/book to write?
2177 2018-07-19 19:11:39 don’t buy products w palm oil!!!!
2178 2018-07-19 19:11:36 Tilray does not produce "candies, cookies, and other edibles," but they are permitted to produce cooking oil. They have several ways of "ensuring their products are safe," and are  required to do that by the Canadian government.

2182 2018-07-19 19:11:13 Think about why an oil executive would be named Secretary of State. Think about the Rosneft info in the Steele dossier. Think about why there is an announcement today that (again) Trump is trying to sell of part of the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve. He's in up to his eyeballs.
2183 2018-07-19 19:10:40 The black outline needs to bleed more like a proper oil leak 
2184 2018-07-19 19:10:40 been trying (read deep nutrition), but basically you can never eat out if you want 100% avoidance. say goodbye to all your favorite chips too (even the "healthy" ones). coconut oil based snacks are quite subpar.

2186 2018-07-19 19:10:30 Milk in jalapeño flavored potato chips. I thought it was gross when I was a meat eater & I definitely find it gross now. They'll stick whatever in whatever to avoid losing $. Granted, potato chips aren't healthy, but take #Fritos for example. 3 ingredients: corn, corn oil & salt.

2190 2018-07-19 19:10:03 Hot oil spat in my eye. So glad the bar manager was to my rescue with the saline solution x
2191 2018-07-19 19:09:53 VE or hybrid sales do not increase! Governments and multinationals prefer to finance the war in Yemen to keep the oil price below the level where batteries are competitive.
We need a barrel at 120$ minimum..
2192 2018-07-19 19:09:23 Dave's a paid oil co. shill. His job is to sit on Twitter and fill other people's timelines with absolute nonsense. It's also the only way he get's any human attn. We mute the Dave's of the world at this point. Buh bye.
2193 2018-07-19 19:09:19 The struggle of needing an oil change but having no time to go do it 
2194 2018-07-19 19:09:16 Evening #somersethour ... hope you are well!!   I actually used @TheChillees garlic and chilli oil tonight #nomnom #taunton #somerset 
2195 2018-07-19 19:09:05 I need to do an oil change n I got no jack stands 
2196 2018-07-19 19:08:53 Chad, yes. Angola (over 1000 miles between Angola and Nigeria), highly unlikely. The question remains "Why?". Under what foreseeable circumstances would Chad Mig29s attack Nigeria? Chad is vulnerable in so many ways to counterstrikes, including oil exports out of Cameroon.
2197 2018-07-19 19:08:53 That’s really promising, just today someone was telling me their friend with a brain tumour  has been using cannabis oil and has seen an improvement after being told there was nothing left to do. I hope this continues for you and Cornishman too 
2198 2018-07-19 19:08:42 This. Is. Sparta! Lol...seriously though, the rabbit hole goes so much deeper. Retiring SCOTUS Kennedy’s kid is Trump’s banker at Deutsche Bank, known for laundering Russian money, he probably got a piece of the Russian oil co in the Rosneft deal, it’s all starting to come out.
2199 2018-07-19 19:08:39 Why not just put  oil  or lard , which ever you prefer , into a saucepan, heat the oil up then put your chips in  and cut your chips accordingly.. Simole as a pimple if you haven’t a chip pan 
2200 2018-07-19 19:08:30 Bukan intern tapi start kerja  semeta belajar sero. Susah sikit area tu tapi ganu bukei banyak company oil and gas?
2201 2018-07-19 19:08:24 Standard Oil was also seen to be increasing the prices that people paid, so it was easier to get political support against it. A lot of the giants now are seen to be lowering prices or to provide useful services for free via ads.
2202 2018-07-19 19:08:09 Wonder do any of his DUP mates have special envoy links to oil producing despot countries...
2203 2018-07-19 19:08:05 and do the sheets i'm pretty sure i'm sleeping in oil by now but i can't be bothered to do anything.
2204 2018-07-19 19:07:52 Good grief is this the kinda weirdo who collects £300 a day off taxpayer 2 tell us what we’re supposed 2 do.Think he’s bloody lucky 2have 1 female after him let alone 2.

2206 2018-07-19 19:07:46 I need to do a oil change already 
2207 2018-07-19 19:07:46 Why do oil changes have to be so expensive?????
2208 2018-07-19 19:07:41 Isaiah 61:3...
"To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that he might be glorified."
2209 2018-07-19 19:07:35 Is  the oil Tuscan estate-origin, first cold press? Or that crappy mafioso blend from Spanish and North African olive pulp?   I hear God is partial to the quality stuff.
2210 2018-07-19 19:07:26 No olive oil then?
2211 2018-07-19 19:07:26 Just woke up to @midnightoilband - "The Dead Heart". 

How have I missed this!? @pgarrett is a genius. The lyrics. Powerful.

2217 2018-07-19 19:06:15 This was between 2002 and 2006 and you’re making it sound like it happened yesterday. What’s @GovRaimondo taken this year from oil companies and why hasn’t she signed the pledge for this election cycle like Matt has?
2218 2018-07-19 19:06:12 The Safeguards or World Class Spill Response that was supposed to precede the loading of oil tankers for China and shipping this toxic, flammable sludge through Metro Vancouver and the Burrard Inlet. Without this promised safeguard, do you still think this pipeline is necessary?

2222 2018-07-19 19:05:20 Doesn't this study help to explain Republican fondness for Vladimir Putin--the fact that principle GOP donors share his economic need for continued oil energy dependence?
2223 2018-07-19 19:05:20 One has to be certified insane to believe that diesel, a byproduct of crude oil, can come out of a rock in Chinhoyi. You have to be confined to an asylum if you believe such people can lead a country out of a deep economic mess to prosperity. Insanity at its worst

2226 2018-07-19 19:05:15 For some reason, getting my oil changed is one of those incredibly socially awkward experiences for me. Probably because I have reoccurring cringe from the time I accidentally turned on my car during it and nearly electrocuted my mechanic 
2227 2018-07-19 19:05:10 They said the president has little control over oil prices.  They are not blaming him.  Reading comprehension?

2229 2018-07-19 19:05:09 Vegetable oil is atrocious for your health and you should never cook with it or consumer it
2230 2018-07-19 19:05:08 Just saw Judge Jeanine on the view and she kicked ass to the point Whoopi kicked her off the set. On another note, I bet whoopi's dreads smell like a mix of pachuli oil and urine.

2234 2018-07-19 19:04:59 “Plantain meets oil” type beat
2235 2018-07-19 19:04:54 "A rich country blessed with oil", that's precisely what makes it difficult.
2236 2018-07-19 19:04:49 Really?Where the ceude oil from?
2237 2018-07-19 19:04:42 If you take fish oil and drink 3+ cups of water a day, you will never die.
2238 2018-07-19 19:04:38 A fair point, yet deductions, such as the depletion allowance deduction, are like indirect subsidies to oil and gas producers. Allowing subsidies for certain sectors is essentially rigging the market. Also, opportunity costs don't always reflect the welfare of consumers.
2239 2018-07-19 19:04:31 I thought a law was passed years ago the oil companies had to put netting over the pools?
2240 2018-07-19 19:04:24 I’m sitting in the car getting my oil changed & this nigga all in the car shooting his shot.

2246 2018-07-19 19:03:49 Yes oil and other natural resources for both as well as territorial expansion for Russia. 

They also want to strengthen this alliance of autocrats because it makes prosecution of the criminal activity of themselves and their associates (for money-laundering, etc) less likely.
2247 2018-07-19 19:03:32 The capitalist billionaire siphon off the world's oil into their tankers, while millions have to burn manure for heat.
2248 2018-07-19 19:03:30 if the lorry drivers of the country were so inclined they bring this situation to an end very quickly. blockade the oil refinerys. we'd go from state of emergency to martial law overnight. government would fall
2249 2018-07-19 19:03:29 interesting.  Casual element of Aberdeen support in 80s would be a different case - city was booming due to oil when this group got its notoriety.
2250 2018-07-19 19:03:28 I may be a little over myself when I say this, but after corruption in oil, another area where’s there’s massive corruption is in the NGO sector. Someone with links in the government starts an NGO for the sole reason of attracting grants with nothing to show for it.
2251 2018-07-19 19:03:16 Cashing oil industry checks and probably dying of old age before it matters to him personally.
2252 2018-07-19 19:03:03 I only recently learned that "dinosaurs turned into crude oil" is an incorrect myth.

Maybe it was actually these people who turned into crude oil.
2253 2018-07-19 19:03:01 How rude! I absolutely cannot abide people who tell me I should have given my 8yo cannabis oil. As if you’d take a chance on a YouTube video when an expert is telling you this is your best chance. Take no notice! You’re ace!

2260 2018-07-19 19:02:18 Barely. But I heard people pre treat with oil over night before wash day and I might start doing that.
2261 2018-07-19 19:02:08 you joke but there is literally an oil baron here named HAROLD HAMM who holds tremendous influence over this university and state
2262 2018-07-19 19:02:05 I am ok with dairy but soy messes me up bad and sometimes nuts make me break out. The good thing is, grapeseed and olive oil carry THC really well too and taste good. Am half French, born in the USA. Life without cheese, bread and butter is NEVER happening!
2263 2018-07-19 19:02:01 Looks like some goose poop to me. The one that always gets me is raccoon poo on the fairways. I will never fault a guy for calling if they think it is grease or oil tho better safe than sorry.
2264 2018-07-19 19:01:52 Bye Chris, the only thing you've added to the convo is denials, diversions, standard oil shill talking points & no back up to a single statement. That's what got you the most upset. You're so angry you could spit at your lack of proper refutations. Have a better day elsewhere...

2268 2018-07-19 19:01:30 As far as Crimea still being a part of the Ukraine then yes. As it being annexed by Russia isn’t really recognized by the international community. US oil production is sustainable at this rate for 10 years tops Then it drops. So not sustainable for energy Cause research.
2269 2018-07-19 19:01:29 Gonna go get my oil change alone for the first time, I’m scared
2270 2018-07-19 19:01:13 Tar sands are a climate disaster! The oil from tar sands is twice as carbon intensive as most crude oil, doing twice as much damage to our climate #StopPipelines @Barclays
2271 2018-07-19 19:01:09 Big money donors make politicians beholden to the kill-care bigwigs, to the oil industry (including fracking), to the food industry (GMOs), to the NRA, the list goes on. It all leads to corrupt elections.
2272 2018-07-19 19:01:08 Big oil's interest precludes a non-adversarial relationship for now.

2275 2018-07-19 19:00:53 Bills paid, car oil changed, it’s a wonderful feeling.

2277 2018-07-19 19:00:48 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.

2286 2018-07-19 19:00:01 Working on that #fanfic - not really #fanfiction. It's taking characters that exist, and putting them in my own world. A magical world, of course. 

What happens when you use too much "Come To Me" oil in a love spell? Let's find out together. #roughdraft #amwriting
2287 2018-07-19 18:59:56 Because it still cannot produce when cloudy or night! And trade off studies still, usually show a net Cost to system, not a gain from alt energy sources. (Maybe someday, but oil will need to be Much more expensive, or solar/wind prices come down drastically)
2288 2018-07-19 18:59:55 The province has been a one-trick pony for too long. The PC's had ample opportunity to invest in new technology and business and never did. Lazy and -- to a degree -- corrupt. It will take big investment to move forward. Oil is quickly becoming a dinosaur.
2289 2018-07-19 18:59:46 They live in a rich country blessed with oil, yet widespread smuggling from Iraq’s northern Kurdistan siphons off money that could go to the central government.
2290 2018-07-19 18:59:46 The oil creates a fat layer trapping heat in?
2291 2018-07-19 18:59:43 Probably just got the bill for the oil change.
2292 2018-07-19 18:59:43 4% of Russian oil company Rosneft.  
2293 2018-07-19 18:59:42 It sure is when your government is in the pocket of oil companies. Business over everything else.
2294 2018-07-19 18:59:39 Na e85 is cheap pretty much veggie oil

2298 2018-07-19 18:58:58 I respectfully disagree. I think parliament stands to generate more money from ignoring the best interest of the people/humans and incentivising big oil/manufacturing/carbon producers free reign of their lands in exchange for export/import taxes and more short term jobs.
2299 2018-07-19 18:58:49 @SBakerMD What are your thoughts on canned sardines in extra virgin olive oil?
2300 2018-07-19 18:58:44 Lemme get this oil change rq
2301 2018-07-19 18:58:31 Do you do hot oil treatments?
2302 2018-07-19 18:58:04 Level 2 tomorrow, and then I can work on my personal to-do list. Oil change, doctors appt, etc you know, the stuff that can always wait 
2303 2018-07-19 18:57:42 The statue says, oil me once and awhile would ya
2304 2018-07-19 18:57:37 yeah i just use the plant and keep it wrapped up in the fridge.
i cut a little bit at a time and put it on at night before my moisturizer.
it keeps my skin hydrated (so i don't overproduce oil) and tightens my big ass pores. 

2305 2018-07-19 18:57:28 I’m getting my oil changed and the girl next to me has her dog in here and I’ve never been happier to be waiting

2307 2018-07-19 18:57:26 Hahahahaha  most likely ppl would start consuming it thinking it has got holy powers. Next thing we know it wouldn’t even be olive oil, but some form of metallic grease

2312 2018-07-19 18:56:15 It'll be a 5-star book for sure. The second part is about how to cure rabies by pouring oil in a dog bite. And then there are some songs at the end. 
2313 2018-07-19 18:56:12 This phony is ca$hing in on all of you knaves. From speaking fees and his waste of wood-pulp publications - snake oil business has never been better.   What a thing it is to be a self made man-who has made himself a symbol of lies and unashamed vitriol.  Get thee to a nunnery.
2314 2018-07-19 18:56:03 They weren't telling lies. The price of oil dropped worldwide and every country suffered from the volatility in the market. Like other countries it would have altered to the situation and acted accordingly until the price re-established itself, as it has done.

2320 2018-07-19 18:55:14 Ahhaha example of competent union leadership .. is he aware Canadian oil is already traded at heavy discount and US produces 3x more than Canada ?
2321 2018-07-19 18:55:09 The cynical person could be forgiven to think this is to aid Trump in the American mid term elections, particularly when he virtually begged Saudi to increase production to lower the cost of oil.
2322 2018-07-19 18:55:08 They wanted Tillerson because of his connection to oil. Sanctions on Russian oil hurt their economy. The hope was for Tillerson to nudge towards removing sanctions, even if for his own interests. They'd probably hope to cut a deal with him to get their oil in thru his company.
2323 2018-07-19 18:54:56 My Italian Duolingo lesson had me translating sentences about a woman drinking oil.

Mum calls you to come wash the dishes and you've been enjoying it. All of a sudden, she brings the biggest pot that contains lots of red oil for you to wash. #MoraleTiDown
2325 2018-07-19 18:54:48 Or... We could just focus on non-carbon-emitting sources like hydro, wind, and solar. Also, make the necessary investments in battery storage to cut out oil, gas, and coal as they would no longer be needed for base energy production. We could be 100% green by 2040.
2326 2018-07-19 18:54:41 why did @ShashiTharoor buy oil from saddam husain?
2327 2018-07-19 18:54:37 @Budget the first car I was given this morning reeked of smoke and the change oil light was on. I was given a different car that was dirty but I was in a hurry. I have almost reached my destination and this car needs an oil change. What is going on??!!

2332 2018-07-19 18:53:41 Baby oil is THE worst
2333 2018-07-19 18:53:40 The last time I was in UEA Dubai, the surprising thing I found out was that oil is ranked 5th in the order of important sectors of the economy. In fact services in Transport and logistics rank first, followed by entroport trade, tourism and sports. They are hedging against oil.
2334 2018-07-19 18:53:39 Take bread, dice the bread, get some olive oil and garlic on that bread, bake that bread

2339 2018-07-19 18:53:16 Yes yes yes it's amazing you just have to go to the right place bc truffle oil can be an unbearable taste if there's too much
2340 2018-07-19 18:53:08 Uhhhh what? Are you claiming Russia is arming the Ukraine  Also Texas is set to be in the top 3 of oil production next to SA and Iran. You think we are simply selling coal? Not oil, not setting up to be the world leader of natural gas? Stop waiting and go do some research

2355 2018-07-19 18:51:18 None of that stuff was going to happen.Hillary is realistic. She’s not a snake oil salesperson like Bernie is,selling miracle cures to the naive.Obama couldn’t get free community college through,& Saint Bernard was promising free college,even private ones.He was playing to idiots
2356 2018-07-19 18:51:09 I am sure of that, like how NS oil that is transferred to tanker at source is not attributed to Scotland.

2366 2018-07-19 18:50:17 Carbon tax does reduce carbon emissions very effectively. That’s not an opinion but a well documented fact. I get my electricity from hydro and I’m buying an electric car so I could care less how much oil costs.

2380 2018-07-19 18:48:58 A combo of a hormonal IUD, spironolactone, using argan oil at night with a topical salicylic acid cream, a vegan diet, and lots of sunscreen!
2381 2018-07-19 18:48:52 To be honest I can’t answer that with any hard fact because we don’t have access to E85 at very many places near us . But I’m burning a product I raise myself that is plentiful and reduces foreign oil usage

2394 2018-07-19 18:46:33 It's a losing strategy at best, even if the races that ARE spent on are won more than they're lost, because it is simply numerically impossible to spend that much everywhere without crazed oil billionaires backing things up.
2395 2018-07-19 18:46:20 Olive oil?  Is it supposed to be tears or blood, not olive oil.
2396 2018-07-19 18:46:17 He would never call her a scumbag but she was stamped with bank money & wouldn't release her transcripts, approved of fracking, had a foundation pulling in Saudi oil money in the millions, the DNC in her pocket...  And she thought she could beat tRump?

2399 2018-07-19 18:46:11 I'm doing the same thing here. I make Justin Marshall oil. It is similar to Rick Simpson's oil just not activated with heat. I take one a day and it killed my cancer. I'm still in remission. Now I help others heal to
2400 2018-07-19 18:46:08 I just need to lay out on the altar and drench myself in praying oil.

2402 2018-07-19 18:45:45 actual evil person and people in charge of our country. Save money there and probably promise to some sort of oil interest group.

2466 2018-07-19 18:39:12 Crude oil

2485 2018-07-19 18:37:15 I wouldn't be 1/2 as healthy as I am without lavender oil tbh that shit has got me lookin and feelin like a flower queen
2486 2018-07-19 18:37:08 Is one Charlie Gard? There was no medical reason to continue his treatment and it would have been unnecessarily painful and cruel. I’m with the doctors on that one.  Was the other the cannabis oil one? I agree that’s stupid but so did the doctors. That wasn’t the NHS’s fault

2490 2018-07-19 18:36:42 This is all about Oil bloc licence.
2491 2018-07-19 18:36:40 We can be compassionate without making excuses and validating poor, homeless, addicted. Tough love policies characterized by left as mean spirited and cruel. The real cruelty is perpetuating condition of these groups locking them into a miserable lifestyle.
2492 2018-07-19 18:36:36 here's a weird thing I discovered while at the lake: if you forget to bring makeup remover on vacation but wherever you're staying has olive oil, it makes a great makeup remover and makes your skin feel super soft
2493 2018-07-19 18:36:35 Hate to burst you bubble but, although better for you you than some oils, coconut oil is still a fat.
2494 2018-07-19 18:36:10 Had to take my car to Honda for an oil change and omw there I thought man instead of popcorn they should offer massages... and today they did wow wtf awesome!
2495 2018-07-19 18:36:05 If you drive slow on oil and chips you’re a lil bitch

2509 2018-07-19 18:33:57 My bets on others baptized ... We invaded entire countries who tried to trade oil in other currencies. US GOV & FED not going to roll over.  They will light EM on fire if they have to in order to preserve the status quo
2510 2018-07-19 18:33:56 So my mom went to get her oil changed, and the mechanic goes "Ma'am your transmission fluid needs to be flushed." Then my mom proceeds to go, "Well I can go ahead and tell you that's not going to happen BC my husband doesn't believe in it."

2514 2018-07-19 18:33:46 After oil spills, why would anyone eat oysters from that area?
2515 2018-07-19 18:33:39 And we don't really know who those paymasters are...some Republicans..maybe oil, drugs companies. To get charitable status, companies should have to be transparent.
2516 2018-07-19 18:33:37 Surely this should be illegal. The fashion industry’s environmental impact is second only to oil. There is an urgent need for regulating it, if we’re ever to meet our emission targets.
2517 2018-07-19 18:33:36 They only take foreign oil in que. So who gives a shit
2518 2018-07-19 18:33:27 Typo 
2519 2018-07-19 18:33:14 Some on this thread have already expressed this.  We have time to deal with this habitat issue, it's not life or death, not on this day, or tomorrow.  Do NOT fall for Trump snake oil, smoke, mirrors, dogs and small horses.  This day,we choose to drill down and focus on Helsinki.
2520 2018-07-19 18:33:04 kanada, emptied of its minerals and dirty oil. emptied of its trees and water. a crippled thing, drowning in a puddle, covered in ants. the ocean doesn’t give a shit because it knows it’s dying too.
2521 2018-07-19 18:32:59 BARBARIC
make a fine sauce that just need plain pasta, no salt, no oil. 

Get yourselve lubricated, not your pasta
2522 2018-07-19 18:32:59 I'd say she'd be leaking extra virgin olive oil not ordinary olive oil if it's legit
2523 2018-07-19 18:32:57 It also says “It will also be free from palm oil, the controversial vegetable oil found in a number of supermarket products that has been linked to deforestation.

Purezza claims the product will also be environmentally-friendly and ethically-sourced.”
2524 2018-07-19 18:32:57 So work employed a Muslim driver. He fasts during Ramadan, so he's driving 44 tonnes without eating or drinking for 15 hours a day. Yep that's safe.
He put water in the oil, ruined the engine, got sacked for it, then his Muslim lawyer wrote a letter threatening court action.

2526 2018-07-19 18:32:51 Those Arabs with their oil wealth can guzzle as much Chinese loans as possible to undertake mega infrastructure programmes. Such welcome is befitting but for a poor nation it would be catastrophic!
2527 2018-07-19 18:32:12 I’m guessing oil and gas.

2529 2018-07-19 18:32:08 I've got an old fashioned deep fryer, but if I do chunky chips, I do them in the oven sprayed with olive oil. Same with wedges.
2530 2018-07-19 18:31:59 Yesterday NPR had a really depressing piece on how many birds are dying from landing in and drinking out of toxic pools at oil rig sites. The Trump admin removed the fines for these sites, so now  companies don’t bother to clean them up. WHY we have legal regulations.
2531 2018-07-19 18:31:55 Are you freakin kidding?

2536 2018-07-19 18:30:33 They also don’t have a dynamic economy...heavily dependent on oil. It’s more complicated than just saying socialism sucks...you’re better than this
2537 2018-07-19 18:30:32 There is nothing good about them, I got them done and you can’t wear eyeliner, use any makeup remover with oil in it and when they fall out it’s so disgusting

2539 2018-07-19 18:30:29 This would be a gift for oil/gas/mining/ranching interests in the western US. Without habitat protections, there is no conservation of threatened or endangered species. No need to kill them, they'll go extinct "naturally".

2542 2018-07-19 18:30:07 Actually, you reluctantly opposed oil drilling off the Maine coast after anguishing over it. It is time to move beyond climate change studies. The EPA has been greatly harmed by your president. A #CarbonTax and dividend would be an efficient way to spur clean energy. #mepolitics
2543 2018-07-19 18:29:53 $100 oil change  
My haircuts $50 now lol
2544 2018-07-19 18:29:48 Oil = changed

2545 2018-07-19 18:29:42 Don’t wash your hair everyday, like if you have a down day just run water through it, it’ll help it grow a lot. Natural oils help sooo much, my hair went from my shoulders down to my butt in about a year. Also coconut oil treatments are amazing!

2548 2018-07-19 18:29:32 The key is to start with oil at the bottom with curry seasoning. Basically like making a roux . Ill dm u my recipe
2549 2018-07-19 18:29:26 I remember that oil scarcities in the 70s and can only say this 'leave it in the ground' is insanity and absolutely not Socialist !!! How can Brid Smith justify this nonsense !
2550 2018-07-19 18:29:18 Didn't know Seymour Sweeney was an oil dealer!
2551 2018-07-19 18:29:17 I imagine liquid cooled subwoofers would be excellent for competitions. If done properly, you could probably liquid cool the voice coil/s with mineral oil, effectively making them impossible to blow lol
2552 2018-07-19 18:29:15 Work kook, cuma kalo menurut gue lebih difokusin pas make oil cleanser/milk cleanser sama pas ngusepin/? fw sih. Itu sebenernya yg bikin bener2 ngangkat kotoran di muka kita
2553 2018-07-19 18:28:53 Wigs are good too. Just gotta know how to style them and keep oil on them. Get a stylish scarf to wrap around it and you can’t even tell issa wig

2556 2018-07-19 18:28:35 Yeah bro and changing oil is wild easy. Once you get the hang of it it takes 5 min

2564 2018-07-19 18:27:40 Had a week long, maybe two weeks of conversation with a guy that turned creepy. He asked me if I loved him, told him I didn’t even know him!! Then he asked me to send $$ to his son (16 yrs old) because he couldn’t access his bank account—he was an engineer out on an oil rig
2565 2018-07-19 18:27:26 Hair fertilizer, vitamins it’s some one a day vitamins that are gummies and so good they have 333% biotin in them. I’ve been taking them for a month now and my hair is growing fast asl. Do protective style like a pulled back bun/ball and just keep lots of oil on your hair
2566 2018-07-19 18:27:20 Let me guess.  Were they cooked in soybean oil?  Very unstable and very unhealthy oil.
2567 2018-07-19 18:27:16 Can I please be your sidekick and warn ppl about mineral oil, how it is NOT moisturizing yet included in like every moisturizer? We can be the cracked skin crusaders (working title)
2568 2018-07-19 18:27:07 Only nations that matter
2569 2018-07-19 18:27:07 OH i think that oil should be poured out. dont give it  back. that will really freak her out after he stays!

2615 2018-07-19 18:22:37 Venezuela... “because the government didn’t save enough money”. No, because the government was corrupt the got greedy and eventually ran out of others peoples money. The oil revenues didn’t keep up with corruption

2617 2018-07-19 18:22:07 Obama sat on his hands during the election... because hrc was supposed to win.

His expulsion and sanctions AFTER the election were 1) too little and 2) too late.  Didn't sanction Russian oil and gas..... which means the sanctions were for show and to drive public opinion.
2618 2018-07-19 18:22:06 The struggle is real. I stand in the olive oil aisle at the grocery store for 20 minutes, googling every option until I find the one that is legit.
2619 2018-07-19 18:22:06 ありがとうございます
2620 2018-07-19 18:22:01 you boil the rice like normal, and then once it’s done you heat up some olive oil in a skillet and fry the rice like that! i fried the vegetables the same way and then mixed it all together and fried an egg to put on it
2621 2018-07-19 18:21:34 Yeah 
2622 2018-07-19 18:21:14 Plastic comes from either oil or from corn (arable land). For every use of plastic we need to ask ourselves, "Is there a better use of this oil or arable land than to make this [plastic straw]?"

2626 2018-07-19 18:20:58 Alex Pierson is sub human. Maybe she should become a food taster, serve her some oil of ipecac, she could hurl her guts out, maybe think about her ugly words. Shame!

2628 2018-07-19 18:20:49 There’s no answer, you’ve just come full circle arguing that an allocation of a shipment of oil through the Burrard Inlet to China justifies it ahead of the twinning of the #TMX. The discussion is political now @BlairKing_ca , you’re value is insignificant as a simple chemist.

2634 2018-07-19 18:19:42 #Iraq: Days after protests erupted in #Basra, dozens of demonstrators stormed the offices of the South Oil Company before security forces regained control.The next day, counterterrorism units were deployed to protect oil fields in the province--not #Iraqi citizens. #IraqProtests
2635 2018-07-19 18:19:40 Didn’t need Steele to figure that one out. Was obvious from day 1. CEO of the largest oil company ExxonMobile who received a ‘Russian Order of Friendship’ medal directly from Putin in years past. Don’t know if that appointment went as well as they hoped it would.

2642 2018-07-19 18:18:23 The bakassi peninsula is rich of gold,oil and diamond.kilimanjaro has signed a contract with a group of people for about 300 million usd to explore that area.This is where everything started.they are funding war to exploit and steal natural resources in that area.very sad
2643 2018-07-19 18:18:04 You lucky lmao, I’ve caught mad flats . Next up changing oil bro.
2644 2018-07-19 18:17:53 I’m waiting to get my oil changed & an elderly man walks up to hand me a teddy bear & says “this is your present for the day”  the Lord knew i needed a pick me up today
2645 2018-07-19 18:17:47 Remember when teachers, public employees, Planned Parenthood, NPR and PBS crashed the stock market, wiped out half of our 401Ks, took trillions in TARP money, spilled oil in the Gulf of Mexico, gave themselves billions in bonuses, and paid no taxes? 

Yeah, me neither.

2649 2018-07-19 18:17:40 Actual research? Bro, the research suggests clearly that Obama pushed the sanctions, that Obama worked to weaken Russian oil prices, and Obama communicated to incoming 45 that he would need to continue to address the problem. He didn’t. He won’t. He can’t.

2654 2018-07-19 18:16:30 Your assumption that non Trump supporters are more interested in war than peace is nonsense. You know the hawks are usually far right people. 
You know I'm in a nation that pushes peace. Trump is not helpful...at all. 
It's not peace they want...it's arctic oil
2655 2018-07-19 18:16:29 When did oil changes get so damn expensive? Geezus.
2656 2018-07-19 18:16:11 Putin has the control of Trump/majority US lawmakers.  Putin is ready to get Russian/US military together.  Trump does not read so Putin likely has all the US secret intelligence information.  Oh and 9-11 was about oil & invading Iraq.
2657 2018-07-19 18:16:10 The only thing Donald Trump is doing is pissing off his allies like Canada and Europe, driving global oil prices up by threatening Iran, and making everything cost more to produce when he targets China. Remember he went bankrupt three times he does not know what he’s doing
2658 2018-07-19 18:15:59 You can have a weaker dollar or lower oil prices but probably not both.
2659 2018-07-19 18:15:51 The philosophy of the Dems as is demonstrated by BO this week w/ his newly found love of a universal wage, ie socialism, is best described as "Poverty plus one". They dont argue mobility out of poverty, just to add a little more padding around the poor, to keep them stuck there
2660 2018-07-19 18:15:47 And what have you done to transition yourself away from oil....nothing...exactly 
2661 2018-07-19 18:15:45 As said, Trump wants to cease opposition to Russia in Syria and the Ukraine to help Putin establish control of oil, natural gas, pipelines and a med port.
2662 2018-07-19 18:15:44 @realDonaldTrump i've been trying to figure out why you side w/putin. here are my theories so far:
1. he taped you having sex w/ivanka
2. he promised you full funding for a trump tower moscow
3. you are the anonymous entity holding 29% control of the russian arctic oil project
2663 2018-07-19 18:15:43 Oil and gas exploration probably.

2665 2018-07-19 18:15:41 I want to go home and snuggle my dog. Delay getting to work due to long ass oil change, new rock chip in window, low coffee consumption. Someone send maple dip or sprinkly donuts. 
2666 2018-07-19 18:15:39 So, are you saying you like #EssentialOils, but you need an #AirFilter?  I mean -- you're removing what you're intentionally putting into the air.  (myself, I can't do oil scent stuff at all!)  Preaching to myself, 'cause I love #cats, but I'm totally #allergic!
2667 2018-07-19 18:15:38 The truth will set us free. Cheap Transloaded oil from abroad and from local refineries are paid for with subsidy-twice what it used to be amidst keeping price of PMS higher than what it was. We occupied Nigeria for this in the past but are silent now so congrats.
2668 2018-07-19 18:15:35 It's a good market for snake oil salemen like Dinesh

People are much, much smarter than this, but some are addicted to the malice that overflows from Dinesh's pen.

2686 2018-07-19 18:13:14 MLAs could never do anything to mitigate Brexit. What snake oil has the SDLP sold you? Ask the SNP. The Tories ignored them completely, ignored legislation and have legislated to take back devolved powers and return them eventually with strings. Are you aware of this?
2687 2018-07-19 18:13:00 Danielle, we're so sorry to hear about the oil burning issue with your Honda vehicle. Has your Honda dealer had a chance to evaluate this concern? Has an oil consumption test been started at your dealer? ^FC

2689 2018-07-19 18:12:57 This is another one of those things he does that serves absolutely no purpose. He pulled out of the Paris Agreement (shortsighted and horrible) but he did it to protect the coal/oil industries (also shortsighted and horrible) so at least you could see his purpose. This has none.
2690 2018-07-19 18:12:48 Venezuela's main economic fail was basing their nation on oil income. When oil prices dropped, Venezuelan economy took a nose dive. Didn't invest in long-term gain (education, infrastructure, diverse economy), now oil is cheap and their money is gone.
2691 2018-07-19 18:12:20 HOW ABOUT LOWER PROPERTY TAXES IN NEW JERSEY, I AM FROM TEXAS AND I KNOW THAT IT WORKS TO GET MORE PEOPLE AND TEXAS DOESN'T HAVE A STATE TAX EITHER.  I AM IN NEW JERSEY BECAUSE OBAMA DESTROYED THE OIL INDUSTRY AND MANUFACTURING.  OIL IS BOOMING UNDER TRUMP.
2692 2018-07-19 18:12:15 Barclays, please don't fund the tar sands pipelines in Canada. Tar sands are dirty oil and have a risk of spillage, including onto sacred indigenous land. Fund eco friendly projects instead? I've included a poll of what people think (please do vote) ...
@Barclays #StopPipelines
2693 2018-07-19 18:12:04 That is a relief. I am worried that many people are failing to follow the technicalities of this case due to the headline of the story which has made the whole thing to be about Christo Wiese. When it should in actual fact be about Tullow Oil and ENS Africa.

2696 2018-07-19 18:11:35 The coupling is that the Homeless deserve compassion & opportunities. It is a sad notion that Liberal govt which, as James Woods points out, constantly misfires, can educate them how to be better at being homeless & its not compassionate to them or illegals to be sanctuary cities
2697 2018-07-19 18:11:30 But have you ever wondered why the US bombing campaign was so incredibly ineffective? Prior to the Russian intervention ISIS was advancing and its oil convoys untouched. The Russians managed to achieve in 2 months what the US failed to achieve in over a year. Odd eh?

2699 2018-07-19 18:11:18 It goes in trends. For a while they put rosemary on everything - then it was truffle oil - then basil. What you really need is a brioche bun with rosemary basil truffle oil!
2700 2018-07-19 18:11:14 I want to know how they tested the oil.
2701 2018-07-19 18:11:13 Totally fabricted news all oil companies in Pakistan are in private sector only PSO is owned by the govt Mr Shami has only one shell petrol pump wich is on lease since 1963 so don't misslead the people by distorting the facts

2705 2018-07-19 18:10:40 No amount of rubbing coconut oil or black castor oil is going 2 help U grow a nonexistent beard - It only helps strengthen, moisturise, N soften EXISTING hair follicles. It doesn’t create new hair follicles, otherwise U would see bald people rubbing their heads with D quickness.
2706 2018-07-19 18:10:38 Question is did the oil contract take place and does it need investigating?
2707 2018-07-19 18:10:35 Remember the South are environmentally conscious, moving past oil to solar power very quickly (admittedly built on the revenues from exciting oil and gas). No flirting with nuclear energy either.

Maybe more about the dragon-pantheons later...

2734 2018-07-19 18:08:14 Got a question why I would say Engineered Explosives is low downside if reprinted. What is the “finance” phenomenon? Real life scenario: if barrels of oil go up in price, people make a decision to drive less or pay up, but many depend on gas, so demand does not change much. (1/4)
2735 2018-07-19 18:08:13 Lot of talk regarding Alberta history today and the only two things I’m concerned about being included in the curriculum. 

1) the date 4500 years ago when JESUS put oil under the province 

2) the day in 1994 when Ralph Klein discovered and pulled that oil out of the ground

2754 2018-07-19 18:06:39 Maybe the University of Minnesota  shouldn't use the words gas & coolant nor oil for their vehicles...instead just mix them altogether and have a neutral pronoun for them and pour into their vehicle and see how that works out for them... of course I'm just being sarcastic..
2755 2018-07-19 18:06:23 In a few months ;) making chili oil
2756 2018-07-19 18:06:21 "SNAKE OIL! GET YOUR SNAKE OIL HERE!"
2757 2018-07-19 18:06:18 It should. He ran on building pipelines from Canada that would provide "thousands of jobs and end our dependence on foreign oil." Problem is, his base will whine and cry at the pumps and when they pay for health insurance but say the economy is doing great and we got a tax break.
2758 2018-07-19 18:06:12 Nice... When are you taking me out for a spin on it? x

2760 2018-07-19 18:05:53 IT COST $21,000 FOR A BUGATTI OIL CHANGE ???? WTF
2761 2018-07-19 18:05:48 Nobel Laureate, Wole Soyinka has Challenged Obasanjo to search his soul very deeply, and swear to this nation that he never awarded oil blocks in return for sexual gratification.
2762 2018-07-19 18:05:46 •Try brushing your teeth with olive oil!! 
•Dip your damp tooth brush in baking soda then brush your teeth!! 
•Rub a mint leaf, orange peel,coffee,whitener on your teeth for about 5•10 minutes. 
•Use toothpaste with extra Florida. 

2763 2018-07-19 18:05:38 OMG I'M MISSING THE ORANGUTAN CONSERVATION AND THE PALM OIL CRISIS EVENT AT THE ZOO.
2764 2018-07-19 18:05:34 out of interest are you thinking of divine things while breathing in the fumes from burning bleached congealed sludge from an oil barrel, or are they beeswax candles? =)
2765 2018-07-19 18:05:24 Had an attempt at the Broad Bean Hummus and black garlic oil tonight, not a bad effort but I’m no @_LisaAllen  luckily I’m back at Northcote to celebrate my eldest graduating on Saturday, can’t wait!
2766 2018-07-19 18:05:22 Nelson Mandela was a good friend of Gaddafi and they created an idea for a comman African customs union based on Libya's large oil and gold reserves and South Africa's diamonds and mineral resources! What a blatant FRAUD! A shameful man. I'll go catch the movie on Netflix!
2767 2018-07-19 18:05:12 No oil or whiskey money in sight
2768 2018-07-19 18:05:03 Just because you think we are too tiny to make a measurable difference doesn't mean we should do nothing. We don't need to be breathing in those toxic fumes. We don't need to waste tax payers money on oil spill clean ups. We don't need another pipeline.
2769 2018-07-19 18:05:00 Someone going to have the audacity to come into the store, pickup the same exact fish oil softgels that she had previously, shake the bottle and due to the sound she says, are these softgels? ... bottle literally says “120 softgels” ... yes. She says “there’s no way” and leaves..
2770 2018-07-19 18:05:00 The Trump Administration’s proposed rule rollback would erode key safety and #environmental protections, which I fear would put our $150 billion dollar American coastal economy at great risk to oil spills. #ProtectOurCoast

2774 2018-07-19 18:04:46 Races like Jon Ossoff's or Conor Lamb's are utterly unsustainable. Jon spent 50 million dollars, and had a 50% spending advantage, and STILL lost. Even professional class corporate coffers can't sustain that, when the bigger oil and gas money is funding the other side.
2775 2018-07-19 18:04:42 You fool! 3-in-1 oil is for arthritis.
2776 2018-07-19 18:04:38 It’s 2018, shouldn’t my oil change guys know to stop making me feel less than.

Women's body wash: Made with augave oil for refreshing moisture, rock salt to smooth wrinkles, lavender essential oil for grace, and kissed by a butterfly for ageless beauty.

Men's body wash: It will clean your balls and smells like wood.
2778 2018-07-19 18:04:21 I need to know now, if it's Extra Virgin olive oil or not.
2779 2018-07-19 18:04:14 You can’t extract oil without a precise plan either for that matter :)

2782 2018-07-19 18:04:02 I make a microwave mug/bowl bread thing with almond meal, flax, an egg, coconut oil, and baking powder for a breakfast sandwich every morning. Want the recipe? Might resolve that sandwich jonesing ...
2783 2018-07-19 18:04:01 I spoiled the hell out of Haze today. Oil change, car wash, tires rotated, new brake lights and full tank of gas. Now we about to go fuck someone’s bitch!
2784 2018-07-19 18:04:01 Remember, gas goes in the gas tank, water in the water tank, and oil in the engine.  These are not interchangeable, unless you want to watch your car burn from having gas in the engine oil...
2785 2018-07-19 18:03:59 True test to "how hot is it": how liquid is your coconut oil sitting on the counter? #heatwave
2786 2018-07-19 18:03:58 Of course they do. There must be oil or some other sort of mineral industry involved

2791 2018-07-19 18:03:29 Follow the money, this is what corporations have wanted so they can drill for oil, mine, develop, wherever they want without endangered species, wildlife preserves, fish habitat getting in their way. These are the same people that gave us Trump with their dark money donations.

2799 2018-07-19 18:02:54 lol get over yourself. country is so full of thirsty pervs that any girl can wear that and get attention. So it's nothing special just saying. I'd lick them though. Give u a coconut oil titty massage too. See what I mean?

2806 2018-07-19 18:02:06 I feel GDP is fuzzy & not precise measures of Economy. It's fixation on MORE & not BETTER. Ex PM MMS handling Economy was remarkable considering 2008-09 recession, global oil price etc. This Govt ruined Economy as jobs , private investment , agriculture etc are biggest concern.
2807 2018-07-19 18:01:52 This just in....

2809 2018-07-19 18:01:47 Govt counts on cdns to forget about these tentacles called Councils after established. For years this one has been under the radar causing problems with our oil/gas industry. Good on P Foster. Now it’s time this Council is shut down @lamphieryeg @rally4resources @SuitsAndBootsCA
2810 2018-07-19 18:01:40 first on the list of mods for the WRX is an air oil seperator, getting rid of the carbon fiber trim pieces on the dash, and a cobb access port so I can enrich the fuel mixture a bit. Then that's gonna be it until it's out of warranty.

2813 2018-07-19 18:01:30 @kerrinpr #flyover I feel every time the oil and gas companies were mentioned you changed the subject. They play a MAJOR role in land loss and hold our politicians in thrall. More needs to be said, especially after the devastation of the BP and other oil spills.
2814 2018-07-19 18:01:27 How about we just agree to buy Russian oil if Putin gives up every dirty american politician on his payroll and or kompromat.
2815 2018-07-19 18:01:21 Well the USA has imported about 65million barrels of oil from Venezuela Jan to April 2018), so using your daddy's logic ( Germany imports natural gas from Russia) you all are controlled by Venezuela. Better change your flag.
2816 2018-07-19 18:01:19 Its great for certain ailments, but not all of them.  CBD is not THC, nor is oil always the best choice for a patient.
2817 2018-07-19 18:01:19 Pretty sure all the radiation from the Japanese power plant and BP spilling oil into the ocean is a bigger threat...But that’s not the hip cool thing so no one is talking about that. But whatever makes you feel better about yourself...cause that’s what it’s really about...
2818 2018-07-19 18:01:18 Avocado toast Two egg whites fried (with light butter or zero calorie spray oil) some fresh black pepper and salt  with 2 slices of turkey bacon (or nornal bacon) and a nice hot cup of green tea. (Fruit flavored green tea is fun) it is an acquired taste with out sugar. So try it
2819 2018-07-19 18:01:18 Our favorite oil in beard oils is Jojoba. Jojoba most closely matches human sebum which means it is immediately and completely absorbed into the beard and skin for ultimate nourishment.
2820 2018-07-19 18:01:14 This is why your side will never win...Virtue signalling is soooooo 2015. Gas and Oil has been and still is a great part of your state...grow up...if you don’t like it..DONT BUY IT
2821 2018-07-19 18:01:08 Read @MarieFrRenaud s timeline.....her job is simply to attack attack attack @jkenney ....truth be damned..an alternate reality permeates many of her postings....kinda Shameful..this Prov is hurting from anti oil Socialist policy that sadly it seems you adore
2822 2018-07-19 18:00:36 It would not occur to couple drug rehab/address the homeless prob with work programs even in the so called jobs Americans won't do. Would get them off streets and on first rung of job ladder. Instead of importing more illegals
2823 2018-07-19 18:00:34 I like courgette rice too! Grate a courgette, stir it into freshly cooked rice with a bit of oil or butter, mix it up, pop the lid back on and off let the heat from the rice warm the courgette through before serving
2824 2018-07-19 18:00:31 Yes the Haitian castor oil they sell it at Whole Foods. (I got the peppermint one) it’s amazing- skin hair. Eyebrows. Glow and growth

2828 2018-07-19 18:00:21 I believe, the Irish Government sold (gave) their Gas and Oil fields to StatOil - Equinor.
2829 2018-07-19 18:00:19 yes,  CBD oil doesnt work for everybody..especially those with nerve degenerative issues.  THC has been shown to be more promenant there.   

Oral oils also take a while to feel relief.  Sometimes that relief needs to be instant.

2833 2018-07-19 17:59:59 Would’ve kept my G if it wasn’t plagued with the oil consumption problem that all 05’-07’ stick shift G35’s have. I had to add a quart of oil every 500 miles and I just had to get rid of it before the engine would’ve blown up on me. They quoted me $10,500 to rebuild the motor...

Do not let this go thru. @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @GOP @DNC  Leave their habitat alone. You don't need that much oil, gas, or coal. We need our wildlife.

2851 2018-07-19 17:58:16 I went to my favorite place to get an oil change because it’s always quiet and they have free coffee and HGTV and someone is trying to talk to me. SIR. THIS IS MY OASIS!
2852 2018-07-19 17:58:10 The fact that Oil King is rocking the galaxy deep V with the booty shorts should make Capcom buff Rashid back to his old self.
2853 2018-07-19 17:58:00 So many Oil & Gas Offices had to close down on the island ( Lekki Phase 1) after PMB took charge because, to some extent the leakages has been blocked.

2861 2018-07-19 17:57:23 I think the quick mini-pops are dollar plays. The dollar looks ripe for a little fall. EURUSD popped today. Maybe the idiots who think "OMG the dollar is falling.....BUY OIL NOW!!!!" are trying to come back. No matter. Those fools got destroyed in early February remember? :)
2862 2018-07-19 17:56:57 “Extracting" data without a plan for use of metadata that describes it, including provenance, policy etc is an invitation to chaotic, error-prone usage. Data is NOT oil.
2863 2018-07-19 17:56:52 Prior to our attempt at overthrowing Assad, Syria was a modern nation with low poverty, low government corruption, high rankings on the freedom index, a sustainable system, peaceful relations with Israel, no Sunni-Shia violence, and on.

What they did do was allow an oil pipeline
2864 2018-07-19 17:56:33 You're always welcome to use my ramps to carry out an oil change or any other bits & bobs over at my Essex pad. Saves a few quid.

2868 2018-07-19 17:56:07 peppermint oil has to be one of the best oils I have. a lifesaver.
2869 2018-07-19 17:56:00 "Burning The  Midnight Oil" was such an interesting choice for William Price dream sequences. Death, dying, loss and grief are major themes in country & country-western music- they had lots of choices- but this song's not about that. Avoiding cliche, maybe?
2870 2018-07-19 17:55:40 3- NO SNACKS
  Cutting on snacks will decrease the acne on your face which will help clear your skin.

4- USE VINEGAR
  Apple cider vinegar is really good for your skin so just use it with your daily moisturizer.

5- COCONUT OIL
  Use coconut oil everyday for a efficient result
2871 2018-07-19 17:55:35 pls, where do they tap palm oil? i hope it's not from a coconut tree.
2872 2018-07-19 17:55:25 If Edinson had listened to the likes of @obyezeks , there won't be candescent bulb today. Maybe we would still have been using palm oil lamp. Enemy of progress and prophetess of doom
2873 2018-07-19 17:55:13 Liberals don’t want public land sold to oil & natural gas companies? Liberals want recourse against polluters? Where you going here?
2874 2018-07-19 17:54:56 I also have a complaint-

I have been a paying sub for many years and yet you still haven't taken your shirt off and rubbed oil on yourself. Very disappointing
2875 2018-07-19 17:54:54 mate not to be that have you tried yoga dick head but have you tried evening primrose oil? mimics estrogen so can make periods loads easier. agnus castus is good too x
2876 2018-07-19 17:54:50 -REMOVE YOUR MAKEUP
-cleanse
-exfoliate (2 to 3 days a week)
-moisturise
-add castor oil to your eyebrows and eyelashes
-add jojoba oil to nails (if you don't have it you can use coconut oil)
-I use body lotion on your legs and arms
-drink 2 to 4 cups of water before you sleep
2877 2018-07-19 17:54:47 when to Green Nissan to get an oil change & they were kind enough to wash the puke off the side of my car from one of my drunk ass friends 
2878 2018-07-19 17:54:46 Invests in more oil am not worried
2879 2018-07-19 17:54:46 Every time I get an oil change, they show me the oil on the stick when they are finished for my approval. I always say, “Looks GREAT!” as if I know exactly what I am supposed to be looking for.

I have absolutely no idea what I’m supposed to be looking for.

2882 2018-07-19 17:54:30 Probably so they can develop the land & drill for oil. Their mantra: Who needs clean water, fresh air, or a strong ecosystem when there's money to be made
2883 2018-07-19 17:54:21 I get oil for mine cos mitzie needs as much sunflower oil & cod liver oil as possible because she has bad joints.. mine love it they have sardines twice a week, then raw chicken the rest of the week.. 
2884 2018-07-19 17:54:21 How on earth do you even know that? It’s not used enough to even know- sound like propaganda from the oil industry and on top of that- plastic causes cancer- I’d rather get hives
2885 2018-07-19 17:54:12 The oil used with the freon in the refrigerant system is highly flammable. If ignighted, it produces POISONOUS GASES. 

DO NOT get close or attempt to extinguish on your own!

Plus, water & electricity don't mix

2886 2018-07-19 17:53:55 Sleep with Vaseline as your moisturizer. Also vitamin e oil/ vitamin e cream during the day!
2887 2018-07-19 17:53:53 Lower dollar higher oil price
2888 2018-07-19 17:53:27 try to find the "bounce bounce" vine, it's been censored by the israeli government for exclusive enjoyment of saudi "r-oil-tea"
2889 2018-07-19 17:53:24 Plastic is cheap because it is a byproduct of oil. They figured out how to make use of their leftover oil - who cares if it causes cancer and kills 100,000,000 animals a year right? Also, Starbucks can afford it.
2890 2018-07-19 17:53:19 かっけー！
2891 2018-07-19 17:53:15 ฝันดีนะคะ @iam_Oil
2892 2018-07-19 17:53:07 Sign for which team ko EPL ? Man City? They're an oil money team just like PSG. They can afford his ridiculous salary
2893 2018-07-19 17:52:58 Minus out the onions n oregano n ur there!!! Olive oil, garlic (fresh n never chopped from a jar), hand crushed tomatoes (never a blender EVER) fresh basil, tiny bit of salt! That’s it really. I’ll put up a recipe with instructions but those r ingredients 
2894 2018-07-19 17:52:51 There’s an essential oil that I’ve been using for my knee and it’s actually helped a lot
2895 2018-07-19 17:52:26 Rafael Cruz is deep deep deep deep deep down in the Russian Asset @NRA’s pockets, along with the Oil & Gas Greedy Mercers’ pockets. The Republicans want to be Fascists & Oligarchs. IMHO.
2896 2018-07-19 17:52:22 He’s placed sanctions on Russia, strengthened NATO (bad for Russia), tried to squash the oil pipeline deal Germany has with Russia, made our economy, borders and military stronger, also not good for Russia. He has done NOTHING for Russia, but be diplomatic in a public setting.
2897 2018-07-19 17:52:11 Ive been vegan 9 months and i try to eat as healthy as possible but those sea salt vinegar chips are my thing too!! Eat the whole bag if its around! Just watched your video with Joe Rogan on cbd oil! Very interesting learning from you sir!
2898 2018-07-19 17:51:49 He’s placed sanctions on Russia, strengthened NATO (bad for Russia), tried to squash the oil pipeline deal Germany has with Russia, made our economy, borders and military stronger, also not good for Russia. He has done NOTHING for Russia, but be diplomatic in a public setting.
2899 2018-07-19 17:51:43 Tar sands are a climate disaster! The oil from tar sands is twice as carbon intensive as most crude oil, doing twice as much damage to our climate #StopPipelines @Barclays
2900 2018-07-19 17:51:41 I’m right there with them. My apartment in Montrose just went up this month, and I was evicted from my last apartment after only living there 3 months bc they decided to sell without notice. It’s now an oil change shop. It won’t be long until I can’t afford to live here anymore
2901 2018-07-19 17:51:40 There's no will because the likes of Saudi don't have the spare capacity to replace Russian oil on the world market. So that is on the "impractical" end, unless we want to trash the world economy.
2902 2018-07-19 17:51:33 Jamaican black castor oil worked pretty well for me
2903 2018-07-19 17:51:32 He’s placed sanctions on Russia, strengthened NATO (bad for Russia), tried to squash the oil pipeline deal Germany has with Russia, made our economy, borders and military stronger, also not good for Russia. He has done NOTHING for Russia, but be diplomatic in a public setting.
2904 2018-07-19 17:51:28 Why doesn't the continent of Africa become the solar power centre of the world?  Or would that upset the oil producing countries of the world?
2905 2018-07-19 17:51:27 I always get the fresh/spring water ones, but I’m sure oil would be fine too!
2906 2018-07-19 17:51:26 reminds me of the iraq retreaters torching the oil derreks, trumps on his heels.
2907 2018-07-19 17:51:23 Rejoined the $oil short but. If it gets bull happy we are out.

2909 2018-07-19 17:51:13 Oil Can delay is probably rare in japan, its electro-mechanical, I imagine the companies didn't want to change to 100v/50hz for the motor
2910 2018-07-19 17:50:57 Funny! I do the same thing! Mostly on my arms, legs and feet, and toes. I guess i should try it on my face too. Right now on my face i “ borrow “ my wife’s “ Regenerist” by Oil of Olay. 
2911 2018-07-19 17:50:55 But...that’s the oil
2912 2018-07-19 17:50:48 @TheeRicktness @Blakemcloughlin @ShaunInce123 series delayed managed to lose my oil cap for my car gotta go get one .
2913 2018-07-19 17:50:47 I’m absolutely obsessed with that oil!!
2914 2018-07-19 17:50:39 This is just a thick coating of boiled linseed oil. I’ll wax in a few days when it’s dried hard.
2915 2018-07-19 17:50:38 I read that you can but can’t use oil based makeup remover! And have to be really gentle removing eye makeup. (Which is the only makeup I wear so I’m def worried about that aspect of them )
2916 2018-07-19 17:50:34 Kiel brothers oil company look it up ,criminal family

2921 2018-07-19 17:50:11 Remember there were two: Clarke and Wynne.  Clarke sadly lost to the socialist whom is preventing Alberta oil from reaching tide water and Wynne sunk Ontario into deeper debt.
2922 2018-07-19 17:50:08 Illegal aliens now have a voting constituency. 
How long before board is 100% illegal alien?
2923 2018-07-19 17:50:08 Had my piece of shit car for 4 months and it’s only 3 years old but the clutch had gone, new brake pads TWICE, smashed window screen, oil leak AND a squished petrol tank ?????? ANYTHING ELSE WANT TO HAPPEN TO IT. :)
2924 2018-07-19 17:50:06 tillerson was supposed to get them a big oil deal if I remember correctly

2932 2018-07-19 17:49:20 That's why under Obama coal, oil and most energy Industries shut down causing me to be laid off. And under Trump I've gotten my job back a raise and a bonus thank you @realDonaldTrump #MAGA #2020TRUMP
2933 2018-07-19 17:49:08 僕を酸化させたらダメだよ。オイルにとって酸化は命取り。…僕を見守っててね⁇
2934 2018-07-19 17:48:59 I got an oil change without asking my dad for help. So basically I’m a grown ass woman.
2935 2018-07-19 17:48:43 Rinse your measuring cup in hot water before using it to measure syrup or oil. The liquid will pour out cleanly instead of sticking to the cup. #CookingwithPappardelles
2936 2018-07-19 17:48:38 God I would not be surprised if fish oil is a giant scam
2937 2018-07-19 17:48:22 July 19 1979 – 2 supertankers collide off the island of Little Tobago, Caribbean Sea, killing 26 and spilling 280000 tons of crude oil
2938 2018-07-19 17:48:21 Yea its gross. For a while they convinced the public they were different than other billionaires (like oil or finance billionaires) and that they actually cared about anything other than profit but man has Zuckerberg disappointed/been exposed over the past year.
2939 2018-07-19 17:48:10 [getting oil changed]

Mechanic: *showing me the dipstick*

Me: *nervously* haha wow it looks, uhh, nice and greasy. my car is gonna be so slippery after that thank you so much 

Mechanic, visibly impressed: when did you graduate car school bc you seem really intelligent
2940 2018-07-19 17:48:05 Reading comprehension. How does it work? Leftists need education. Clearly, free public schools didn't yeah them anything.
2941 2018-07-19 17:47:46 Subaru’s have so much up keep:
Oil change every 5,000 miles and of course it has to be the expensive one. Can’t change just one tire you have to change all 4 bc it’s awd 
2942 2018-07-19 17:47:45 No kidding, I downloaded it after you told me about it. Nothing last night. Did get the Lucas Oil LM race from Jackson, Minn 
2943 2018-07-19 17:47:44 About to have one of those good spa showers. Body scrub, shaving my legs, body oil, the works.
2944 2018-07-19 17:47:43 Genuine virgin olive oil may be the answer to a gourmet prayer
2945 2018-07-19 17:47:43 There is not a magic spell in existence that my 7 blazing torches of holy anointing oil won’t utterly incinerate. Heaven on earth is the only permanent reality.
2946 2018-07-19 17:47:40 Mexico elected hair oil as president
2947 2018-07-19 17:47:30 1.5 -2 million illegals in CA. Presence hasn't made housing more available or affordable, being concentrated in areas it's most needed for AMERICANS.
2948 2018-07-19 17:47:24 Quite possibly. Now in part it is his machine, which is leaking oil... which might make the UK embarrasment complete, or will put the UK deep state machine in a position where they have (figuratively) have to let their trouser down.
2949 2018-07-19 17:47:23 He won't be running again--bet on it! I hated Hillary, and I blame the Rep party for giving us the worst candidate ever. He's a money-laundering snake oil salesman who's in debt to Putin.
2950 2018-07-19 17:47:21 Just like oil exploitation in the niger/chad basin. I believe we must have forgotten.
2951 2018-07-19 17:47:09 Brilliant prize, Id love to try this as Ive been reading a lot about the application of CBD oil in helping with joint pain.
2952 2018-07-19 17:47:03 Big oil, mining, others want to explore without needing to file environmental impact statements.  Money funnels into the GOP, pieces of shit.

2954 2018-07-19 17:46:54 At least, she think's it's oil. It's slippery for some reason.
2955 2018-07-19 17:46:33 Just makes me think of Wolz in The Godfather.  “Then Johnny Fontane comes along with his olive oil voice and guinea charm.”
2956 2018-07-19 17:46:32 WHO WHY WHATis this that OIL THING AGAINWe must go to the source & FIGHT THIS

2960 2018-07-19 17:46:15 Don’t like going to get an oil change alone
2961 2018-07-19 17:46:04 Check your Transmission oil today.
2962 2018-07-19 17:45:58 Sure @RepCohen  ....We'll get right on that coup thing.  After I take the trash out, mow the lawn,  change the oil in the car &...oh wait my AR-15 is in the shop getting cleaned.   YAWWWWN!  Maybe have your secretary call my secretary & we'll do lunch next month sometime...
2963 2018-07-19 17:45:57 Doesn't anyone have to work today? I'm getting  an oil change, what's everybody else's excuse?
2964 2018-07-19 17:45:57 ....In the world of Midnight Oil cover bands.
2965 2018-07-19 17:45:43 Kale be good as fuck with lemon juice and olive oil
2966 2018-07-19 17:45:42 Question is is she still a virgin even though she's had a child and does that mean the price of olive oil is going to go down because it's EXPENSIVE!!!
2967 2018-07-19 17:45:39 Will have to try that out ... are they in water or olive oil??  x
2968 2018-07-19 17:45:33 These are the same people who claim that they are for the People. They are realizing that they are not fit to govern. Sadly, Ontarians voted blindly and fell for a snake oil salesman instead last month!
2969 2018-07-19 17:45:27 Does castor oil really help with hair growth? Not trying to put that stinky oil on my hair for nothing
2970 2018-07-19 17:45:20 no oil is the foundation of the modern society, name one item that isn't make and shipped to you or a store with out the use of oil. Even industrial pesticides are oil based and the trucks that are used to harvest crops and ship them use oil.
2971 2018-07-19 17:45:15 GRAPESEED OIL AND AVOCADO OIL IS THE BEST PERIOD
2972 2018-07-19 17:44:56 I have to get an oil change tomorrow
2973 2018-07-19 17:44:54 If it wasn't for these guys god knows how low the trolls would have driven the price down by, they have been a major reason most have held on and kept the faith! Without question they should at least get a tour of HH and one of those Mini UKOG oil barrels 
2974 2018-07-19 17:44:38 Doterra diffuser!! With eucalyptus and peppermint oil!! Love mine
2975 2018-07-19 17:44:33 I didn't develop a single stretch mark. Organic coconut oil and Vitamin E.
2976 2018-07-19 17:44:16 It’s no secret that this administration would try to get at protected lands for oil
2977 2018-07-19 17:44:14 "The whitest and grooviest things in the world cannot be cuddled or even fondled - they must be kissed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
2978 2018-07-19 17:44:06 No because it's less people that's the wealth is distributed too. Venezuela is a situation America needs to study. What u saw in Venezuela was a leader ..Chavez..openly criticizing the press...embraced Putin...mismanagement of resources (oil) and a loss of confidence in democracy
2979 2018-07-19 17:43:55 the dude changing my oil just looked me dead in the face & goes “hey, you know there’s a lot more wrong with your car than the oil, right?” 
2980 2018-07-19 17:43:41 ive started to do a combination of tea tree & jojoba oil after washing with cetaphil and toning with witch hazel
2981 2018-07-19 17:43:41 Funny, using the oil sublingually seems to be seriously *helping* with my tendency to nausea and vertigo.
2982 2018-07-19 17:43:31 If Pak military succeeds in anointing a Khomeini lookalike ( could be Hafiz), then we will see a totally fascist Pakistan, where one cant breath without being hounded by the state. Pakistan must however understand this.

2994 2018-07-19 17:42:09 I truly hope the rest of the prairies follow suit considering we have the cleanest oil production in the world! #2019Elections  cannot come soon enough for #Alberta and the rest of #Canada to clean up the NDP & Liberal Garbage!
2995 2018-07-19 17:42:06 Ask her why she voted to keep giving subsidies for oil and gas exploration. Pro tip from an old head: she's going to lie to you.
2996 2018-07-19 17:42:05 Never sit on a sofa, always the bouncing ball...eat pineapple maybe? I drank castor oil but wouldn’t recommend it 
2997 2018-07-19 17:42:04 After waiting ONE complete hour for puff-puff to enter hot oil someone comes up and tries to chance me by using "I have an Uber waiting" as an excuse.

I just kept looking at my phone as the lady frying promptly said there were people waiting already.
2998 2018-07-19 17:42:01 Conservatives.

Wrong on civil rights.
Wrong on economics.
Wrong on big tobacco.
Wrong on big oil.
Wrong on climate change.
Wrong on military action.
Wrong on healthcare policy.
Wrong on moral standing.
The only thing good at is bloating extreme wealth and ruining the country.
2999 2018-07-19 17:41:57 Real estate developers, commercial developers, oil and gas, fracking. All his buddies and donors. 

The most precious, scenic places will be subdivided and restricted. But this isn't trump, this has been the GOP for decades.
3000 2018-07-19 17:41:55 “Nyaah!!”

She gave him a punch but it didn’t hurt at all because she had small arms.

“Oh hey Kazuichi.”
3001 2018-07-19 17:41:33 I agree.. I have tried several and the last was only a few and turned out great...tomatoes, olive oil, basil, oregano, onions, garlic
3002 2018-07-19 17:41:24 Russian economy doing OK - current World Bank forecast is 1.7% growth this  year (more than UK) despite sanctions, in part thanks to Trump's attitude to Iran boosting oil prices. Unlikely that Saudi in a position to win a Cold War again.
3003 2018-07-19 17:41:15 That is the truth. Prez Trump did state at least 4 times since Jan 2017 that Russia meddled and obama told him to stop whining cuz russia wasnt interfering.  Facts. Dont know why msm not reporting truth! Msm causing hysteria in our country. Prez oil is back up can u look into it?
3004 2018-07-19 17:41:11 Ottawa’s review is deeply flawed: It omits the role of @CoastGuardCAN in marine oil spill response and the respective roles of the public and private sectors (as well as their interrelationship), in spill response. It’s as if Coast Guard will no longer have a response capability.

3018 2018-07-19 17:39:43 I think your promotion here is a definite step in the right direction having converted 3 vehicles to run on recycled veggie oil with Neoterics systems. I'll mention Dr. Bill Wattenberg has statistics indicating a HUGE decrease in greenhouse gasses could be achieved by (1)
3019 2018-07-19 17:39:27 The conservative movement has become a cult (deeply held beliefs take precedence over facts). That makes them more vulnerable to being taken for a ride by snake oil salesmen.
3020 2018-07-19 17:39:23 I don't know about universe, but humans does have the power to fuck with climate.

Fuck the arse who thought of burning oil in the first place.
3021 2018-07-19 17:39:22 Anyone notice that when tv chefs say "Just add a little olive oil, about 2 tablespoons" you can clearly see about 5 tablespoons being hoiked in to their salsa dressing
3022 2018-07-19 17:39:07 Thanks #wnukrt #womaninbiz its a combination of translucents, gold leaf, oil paints and glitter 
3023 2018-07-19 17:39:06 In the USA, more people work in #cleanenergy - some 3.2 mil - than in real estate, agriculture & investment banking. There're now as many clean energy workers as schoolteachers & there're 2x more Americans working in clean energy than in coal, oil & other fossil fuel industries.
3024 2018-07-19 17:39:05 Just add the cbd oil to the mix.
3025 2018-07-19 17:38:38 baby oil > shaving cream.
3026 2018-07-19 17:38:33 expect the SARB to hike rates in line with Fed policy. 

Inflation will certainly breach higher end of target band with a weaker ZAR, higher oil prices, rising electricity costs & geopolitical concerns.

Cost push (rather than demand pull) inflation does worry me...

3027 2018-07-19 17:38:26 Of course a US citizen would be in favour of stopping the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project. That's because it keeps Canada's oil resources landlocked and forces us to sell it to you Yankees at a $20/barrel discount.  See? This is my shocked-face. 
3028 2018-07-19 17:38:23 I gave up trying to remove them. At some point I used break oil and it just burnt me.
3029 2018-07-19 17:38:23 Hah yeah dude, I’ve been busy afk! Had real life stuff to take care of :) Nothing bad, just meant burning some midnight oil!
3030 2018-07-19 17:38:15 It's crazy on how hard it is to find people to hire to do oil changes for $14 per hour... still looking for two experienced individuals...
3031 2018-07-19 17:38:08 The Republicans are constantly trashing America.
3032 2018-07-19 17:38:02 Labour kept hoping that the oil would run out, negating a need for a by pass.
3033 2018-07-19 17:37:56 Used motor oil makes your grass greener.
3034 2018-07-19 17:37:27 2) if you want to make your lips bigger, then you can exfoliate them using a toothbrush. then, apply cinnamon oil and vaseline sugar and honey mixture. remember, this is only for those who want bigger lips!
3035 2018-07-19 17:37:06 And mosquito bites!  Of course I'll spray lavender oil all over to prevent getting mosquito attacks.
3036 2018-07-19 17:36:43 We should buy only western oil and connect our technology transfers with our targets. Well, America and parts of the EU didn´t make many friends down there during the last decades. On the other hand, the chasing of Coptic Christians could be a NATO case.
3037 2018-07-19 17:36:30 Those oil barrels are blocking your path!
3038 2018-07-19 17:36:29 Put peppermint oil in the diffuser and it opened tf out my nose lawd

3046 2018-07-19 17:35:53 Sales at its core is simply rapport building, educating and problem solving. If you're not comfortable enough to bring your full deck to the prospect you're either full of shit or selling snake oil. #closeit

What’s the BEST at-home teeth whitening product? Preferably one I can buy at like Walmart or CVS or whatever.

(I already use “natural” ones like charcoal, coconut oil, baking soda etc. but I want something more intense.)

3052 2018-07-19 17:35:32 Or a snake oil salesman!
3053 2018-07-19 17:35:29 If its products oil or energy governments will fight each other to solve it but they dont care or not serious 
3054 2018-07-19 17:35:00 Vet recommended CBD oil for my pup.  Transformational.  Wasn't a believer before, but now.  Stuff is miraculous.
3055 2018-07-19 17:34:57 Really?  If you knocked over the milk and it all dumped into the sink you don’t consider it spilled.  Come on Rob this is pathetic.  How about when an oil company is fined in ND and they only pay about ten cents on the dollar, we don’t call that a fine
3056 2018-07-19 17:34:50 @Barclays #StopPipelines
So, why not be positive and non-toxic for a change and invest in hemp oil production?
3057 2018-07-19 17:34:43 Correct but luckily I have investments in actual commodities like gold, silver, and oil.
3058 2018-07-19 17:34:38 Heavy military and police deployments to Basra oil fields have broken up protests there along with negotiations promising to meet demands
3059 2018-07-19 17:34:35 Cheers Jason! Yes mate crushed and coated in Cap oil then covered in Pure Krill liquid. Halves, quarters and bits.
3060 2018-07-19 17:34:19 Pour some oil on them joints and wheel up the bloodclart. We go again!!!
3061 2018-07-19 17:34:13 It is but we just have to hope that Hillary Clinton’s progressivism will prevail.
3062 2018-07-19 17:34:03 i hate getting oil changes because every time i do they find something else wrong with my damn car
3063 2018-07-19 17:34:03 This morning’s breakfast was 2 slices of gluten free avocado toast w/4 whole eggs & coffee w/ a spoon of MCT oil.. Simple right? Stop over thinking your diet. Eat real food. #ThursdayMotivation
3064 2018-07-19 17:33:56 I say we cut a bit from spending as well as take from pfd. Then I’d say we get more into agriculture and leave the oil be.

3067 2018-07-19 17:33:23 Ok so call me a soft little boy but I don't understand how people actually enjoy black coffee it tastes like how I imagine motor oil tastes I mean I can barely drink coffee with milk
3068 2018-07-19 17:33:07 Think 'climate change', which Big Oil would like you to say instead of 'global warming'. Why is that, you think?
3069 2018-07-19 17:33:04 @EnergyInDepth this account is nothing but a mouthpiece for the oil industry.  They do not provide honest, unbiased opinions about, or answers to our energy needs.  The process of burning Fossil Fuels for energy is an old, outdated technology.
3070 2018-07-19 17:33:01 #wipworldbuilders D19: Yes.The South are adept fossil hunters but for the micro-fossils they used to usr for oil prospecting.

In other areas ancient reptile fossils have driven dragon-like pantheons quite different (and more violent) than Apophia's animal / natural world 'gods'.
3071 2018-07-19 17:32:49 good enough to break oil pump gears ?
3072 2018-07-19 17:32:26 I can't even be mad that Bio Oil is so expensive coz it really works
3073 2018-07-19 17:32:18 Is this a setup, to when he's out of office in 2 years, but maybe 6, and oil prices and interest rates rise, he can claim that he kept them low?
3074 2018-07-19 17:32:14 So they can lay that oil pipeline!
3075 2018-07-19 17:32:12 i was already planning to keep oil on them to make them look shiny too :(
3076 2018-07-19 17:32:07 As trade tensions & export tariffs to the US increase we need to increase multi-national export of our top export products and build new markets.  Oil is by far our largest export, but, our regulatory process & protest community limit what we can actually achieve.
3077 2018-07-19 17:32:00 Give us the oil money

3081 2018-07-19 17:31:47 Exactly...when we or city do it everyone is like ohhh its the oil money or dirty money... what financial management are you talking about lol. Liverpool hasn't won a trophy for ages.... Its only in the past couple of years they have been doing well....
3082 2018-07-19 17:31:47 Job killing...higher gas and oil prices...why would Pennsylvania be the only state with this problem. Knock it off. That's a GOP party line..
Apparently all the other states have lost jobs and have soaring fuel costs.
May I interest you in buying a nice bridge in Brooklyn ?
3083 2018-07-19 17:31:14 Surviving on paid media and earlier fall of crude oil prices.
3084 2018-07-19 17:31:04 Not that it matters but Dubai and its “Princes”spent that on a Race Track!  While America was stopped from digging its own pipeline by Obama, they cashed in on our hunger for oil!  And then along came Trump...the Promise Keeper!

3091 2018-07-19 17:30:06 The guys where I get my car’s oil changed know that I’m leaving to Colombia so they keep congratulating me and saying they’re proud of me. I’ve been coming here since I was 8ish so it means a lot. I almost cried lolol.
3092 2018-07-19 17:29:55 how much is an Oil service?
3093 2018-07-19 17:29:54 I can’t use peppermint oil, makes it hard for me to breathe (I know, I’m weird. I also hate lasagna, wearing jeans, and get horrible muscle pains from too much cold or too much heat even if I just breathe it in).

I read tea tree is supposed to also help. But you can’t drink it
3094 2018-07-19 17:29:49 Not my point of course. Even if we take as given that the only goal of DevOps is effective implementation of CD, dismissing everything not directly addressing that as “snake oil” is wildly counterproductive.

3102 2018-07-19 17:29:12 You are a fear monger. I am sure your base will buy it, but the rest of the country will not. Putin is a thug. Diplomacy is fine. Kissing up to him is certainly not. You are a fraud; a snake oil salesman. Worst president ever.
3103 2018-07-19 17:28:58 I’m surprised how confident you are in Oil making it. Ease of schedule and rebound in special teams will be huge, but who is dropping out for them to make it? Blues will be better, Flames too. 
You think losing Perron and Neal will be that detrimental to VGK?

3115 2018-07-19 17:27:00 @RepAdamSchiff @amyklobuchar @SRuhle @RepSwalwell Every move Trump has made as candidate and as “President” is based on greed. They all want their share from billion dollar oil deals, tax cuts, etc. At the end we will learn that this statement is true & names of everyone tainted.

3142 2018-07-19 17:24:00 unfortunately it seems the right engine of the Deuce has developed an oil leak - Aldy noticed the tarmac stain on walkaround and firing up the engine confirmed low oil pressure. It will have to be repaired and made ready to fly again on Monday

3162 2018-07-19 17:20:41 Has anyone ever used MCT oil?
3163 2018-07-19 17:20:37 Heidi LOVES COAL! And she loves oil and she's for STRONG BORDERS and against ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. 
 
At least during election years . . .
3164 2018-07-19 17:20:37 Money is what fortifies a person in the flesh, in the tree of knowledge, but the anointing will consume all the wealth of the earth for the King’s House of Wine and Oil.
3165 2018-07-19 17:20:32 Just saw a suv smashed into a oil tanker, fuel all over the road. pray to god the occupants survived the collision!
3166 2018-07-19 17:20:17 @ntvkenya @KTNNews @K24Tv @citizentvkenya @KBCChannel1 @radiomaisha . Media is buyers to turkana community people, wen turkana are killed in isiolo you cant capture news there, continue asuming our problems. One day at time you wil respect our opinion.@no oil transpotation.
3167 2018-07-19 17:20:08 Pop2 and OIL OF EVERY PEARL'S UN-INSIDES wants a word.
3168 2018-07-19 17:20:00 And yet the filthy peasants are still allowed to vote and express their opinion! HORRIBLE ISN'T IT.
3169 2018-07-19 17:19:56 You did not look at the link did you?
Where does Russia exports oil? Europe!
Look at the link.
Even if there were no common market for American coal and Russian oil, it would still be valid to say that one impacts the other, it's called globalization.
3170 2018-07-19 17:19:49 Love and attraction oil being prepared (started on waxing moon). Will be available after the next full moon. $10 each. Can ship within the US for nominal fee. Message me to place an order!
3171 2018-07-19 17:19:47 @dpradhanbjp oil reference must be mandated to buy ethanol n blend, also make oil pricing mechanism public
3172 2018-07-19 17:19:46 Post 1993, it mainly happened in former Soviet republics. Putin got more and more aggressive with it as he felt his control slipping and oil prices crashed. Russia's economy has shrunk to the size of Australia's. Their life expectancy is dropping.....
3173 2018-07-19 17:19:42 It's almost inevitable for weaker FX, higher oil prices, rising input production costs & uncertain geopolitics to contribute toward higher inflation (medium term).

The Fed will likely tighten monetary policy in the next few months & I expect the SARB to follow with a hike.

3176 2018-07-19 17:19:33 I guess the world has to once again blame zionist leadership for that current oil crisis and the diminution of the global buying power.
3177 2018-07-19 17:19:29 we don't really have much to do with Russia...I mean...trade wise...or really anything....what does the us have to do with Russia these days..what does anyone in us have to gain through ruissia..they are oil and gas that's about it?
3178 2018-07-19 17:19:28 Same with me and United. Not even like we're oil clubs like City or PSG, we're both clubs who have earnt the money we spend so no one really has the right to complain
3179 2018-07-19 17:19:27 Dairy Ice Cream or that other Plant/Veg Oil etc based concoction edible ice aka  "Ice Cream"?
3180 2018-07-19 17:19:19 Rub your hands together with salt and olive oil, rock salt for extreme cases and wear gloves at the gym.
3181 2018-07-19 17:19:18 diy water + olive oil spray then go in with some jamaican black castor oil n you're set. I use that on my scalp and any moisturiser hela for the rest of my hair.

3185 2018-07-19 17:19:05 Our #ThursdayThoughts? Drug corporations spent $280M on lobbyists in the past year alone -- that’s more than tobacco, oil, and defense contractors COMBINED.
3186 2018-07-19 17:19:04 dodgy maintenance no way Drysdale love changing the oil and charging 200 plus, had valve clearances done regular and oil changed more than my socks they're bangers Alan. The original fuel issue has blew oil out somewhere to cause this next calamity  Keep Throwing Money #ktm

3189 2018-07-19 17:18:58 Because at the end of the day,  the conspiracies that he pitches are only to peddle lead tainted snake oil.  His performance art is to generate wealth off of the fearful and easily duped. He is no different than a televangelist or a lower rent Billy Mays.

3191 2018-07-19 17:18:28 Truth is I don't think it was ever an option. They just threw it there as bait, so we don't really ask the big questions. Like how global production of oil is responsible for industrial growth as well as GDP growth and not government policies. So what happens if production drops.
3192 2018-07-19 17:18:25 just get a better oil pump

3198 2018-07-19 17:17:00 @PhilipDaviesUK The UK electorate has lost confidence in PM AND HMG to fight its way out of a paper bag.... 2nd Ref, to determine true will of people, no snake oil on sides of buses - to include Remain, please.  We now know what a catastrophe any form of Brexit will be #stopArt50
3199 2018-07-19 17:16:35 leo keeps screaming every time he touches oil... isn't he a mechanic?

3201 2018-07-19 17:16:30 I just remembered, with the judicial rebuke of American offshore oil drilling, Obama gave something like 500 Million to a Brazilian driller,
Petrobras, in which George Sorros had a large stake in.
3202 2018-07-19 17:16:18 lol does it come off with olive oil? I heard that helps remove makeup but that sounds like it has vibranium in it so idk
3203 2018-07-19 17:15:58 Don't knock a VW Golf. My greatest sadness was writing mine off on the M5 after hitting an oil slick which had already claimed two other vehicles. earlier in the day. The rozzers told me they call it "Dead Man's Bend".
3204 2018-07-19 17:15:49 if you can stomach coffee black then keep doing it. but have you heard of bulletproof coffee? coffee + kerrygold butter + mct oil. with a hand blender the butter emulsifies and makes a nice foam. it's delicious.
3205 2018-07-19 17:15:46 ขอบคุณจ้าาาาา
3206 2018-07-19 17:15:44 Axe is the smell of a BOY. Busch light, motor oil, and dirt is the smell of a MAN.
3207 2018-07-19 17:15:43 Got a free oil change. Guy lost the ticket and he said your good to go. Don't worry about it #myluckyday
3208 2018-07-19 17:15:38 I also don’t believe in fairy tales. But there is a reason why NGOs and ZOOs are supporting sustainable #palmoil. Instead of boycotting palm oil in general, we should support sustainability efforts and empower those that work hard to stop deforestation and preserve biodiversity
3209 2018-07-19 17:15:27 The man who is slimmer than an oil spill, he says she won’t but bets she will, timber

3211 2018-07-19 17:15:10 You know Trump is arming Ukrainians right? Obama just gave them blankets and socks. 

Does Russia want america to be energy independent too, when their main export is oil? Does Russia want increased NATO spending? Does Russia want us killing their soldiers in Syria?
3212 2018-07-19 17:15:08 Try some clove oil on the mouth pain. Less is more, clove oil is extremely potent but very affective. It's what you taste in both orajel and anbesol, but without the added medication.

3215 2018-07-19 17:14:56 lmao when u do chores for your dad and he pays you in weed and oil>>
3216 2018-07-19 17:14:46 A simple way to fix that crisis and to low Oil Price would be to end sanctions on Iran, but I suppose that's an option you don't want people to hear.
3217 2018-07-19 17:14:44 Oil Man was heckin' bamboozled by Hornet Man and went stargazing
3218 2018-07-19 17:14:42 I did, as it removed some surface stains, my teeth felt clean, and the oil was soothing. But the dentist knew from examining my teeth, he asked me, and I had to admit it. My teeth and gums are fine with Lavera though.
3219 2018-07-19 17:14:34 Even the old oil can!

3224 2018-07-19 17:14:15 and I always try to deep condition with coconut oil and a reparative condition mix once a month, sleep in it and then wash in the morning! Sometimes I get fancy and use a shine spray to give my a glow. Most curl stuff weighs down my hair and makes the pattern form weird
3225 2018-07-19 17:14:04 @mrjamesob see that dave fella you had on today? I know many of them. I fly under the radar though because I'm an 'alright' one.
Actual interaction with other humans is a fantastic way of dispelling the myths of the snake oil salesman
3226 2018-07-19 17:14:01 You miss the point. Oil helped accelerate alot, especially through individual propulsion units(diesel/gasoline/etc), but much industrial growth occurred through steam as highlighted by @1234Looper which used various combustibles & non throughout and still does.
3227 2018-07-19 17:13:54 @washingtonpost you say it's not treason, but let's address a few things. 1) Setting up an "Empire" like VP Aaron Burr. Trump's admin consist of Sessions who met with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak; Tillerson, swindeling oil tycoon, good friends with two Russian energy giants.
3228 2018-07-19 17:13:50 I always feel bad for the guys who change my oil because I always wait until my car is about to blow up to go get it changed...
3229 2018-07-19 17:13:43 Go Frack in another State.. Water is a resource we don’t have enough of and Oil & Gas uses a ton of water to Frack.. Get out of Colorado

3231 2018-07-19 17:13:34 Nice one Tek, would you compare this speaker with a Snake oil salesman?
3232 2018-07-19 17:13:24 i think aside from actually purchasing a car, the most adult thing i’ve done is going to goodyear for an oil change but only because my dad told me to

and he’s paying for it
3233 2018-07-19 17:13:23 I need to get a beard kit myself. I just got this beard wash n oil n comb. I need one of those good ass pomades or sumn
3234 2018-07-19 17:13:17 Just for reference, I have not and do not plan on utilizing launch control on the skyline as I’ve heard it has a tendency to break oil pump gears. Not worth it for something that’s not unnecessary!
3235 2018-07-19 17:13:09 @NicolaCaporasok hey there, I'd like to find out more about olive oil!
3236 2018-07-19 17:13:04 Much of Venezuela’s issue arose from inflation when the value of oil and other goods decreased smart ass. Don’t come at me with the anti-socialist argument if you don’t look at all the underlying problems first. And a wannabe dictator messed with their elections, sounds familiar.

3239 2018-07-19 17:12:30 Just made it.... Smells fab!!!! Used lavender oil
3240 2018-07-19 17:12:27 Current best friend: #lavender oil 
Did you know that it not only calms your nervous system, but it improves brain function, is antibacterial, an antioxidant, AND improves your skin’s complexion? 
3241 2018-07-19 17:12:17 To Moe and Dougy, listen byes, I’ll try and explain it to ya.The carbon tax goes directly to the province to help lower your heating costs or anything else to help not waste money using oil or coal. Join the world byes, clean up the mess.
3242 2018-07-19 17:12:14 Normal person: hmm, i got a taste for garlic bread. I think I'll make some Italian

Me: what recipe would allow me to consume 50ml of olive oil to see if that boosts my HDL levels?
3243 2018-07-19 17:12:08 I would be interested to see data on where that oil is going. I would be shocked if much if any stays in the U.S.
3244 2018-07-19 17:12:02 What isn't weird is that I want one
Imagine a thing you could comfort 
by dabbing its cheeks with your bread
If no one's using that bust of Renaldo
can I have it for filling with oil
3245 2018-07-19 17:11:54 i remember them using a bowl. maybe go bigger.  FYI is you have peppermint oil dab some on a cotton ball and place it where you dont want them. I put it in a spray bottle with water and 2 drops of dish soap. shake and mist away!
3246 2018-07-19 17:11:53 Get you a girl that will pack your lunchbox at 4 am but will check your oil if you bend over in front of her.
3247 2018-07-19 17:11:51 1. If you want to overturn a duly elected president you either need proof or guns
2. For the definition of treason, yes
3. It was Trump, not Obama who opened US oil production
4. When confronted by Russian aggression US forces were not ordered to stand down, unlike Obama in Libya
3248 2018-07-19 17:11:50 Do you guys have any of that Pre-98 crude oil, from Iran, no wait, Yemen, yeah, I'll take a glass of that. #complicit

No freedom for citizens.

President Trump did a great job. Two majors nuclear oil powers and following Christian values should work together.

3261 2018-07-19 17:10:29 If you live in a weed legal state it’s easy to find at dispensary’s. If not, you can easily order online. Just do your research because not all oil’s are the same and you want to make sure it contains the best and purest ingredients.

3265 2018-07-19 17:10:08 Have you tried CBD Oil? It hasn’t eliminated my anxiety completely but it has helped tremendously.
3266 2018-07-19 17:10:08 ぼくに言わせればワセリンすら食用だよ。

3274 2018-07-19 17:09:32 Actually There website is very bad it seem been created by elementary school student. I believe oil and gas companies should back to there own website
3275 2018-07-19 17:09:14 OMG you need more oil? It's my birthday tomorrow, can I have a treat?
3276 2018-07-19 17:09:02 Soon as it's legal , you won't be able to afford the pot either. Look at CBD oil. It's already unaffordable where it's legal. Soooooo,  it really doesn't matter what ends up legal. CBD works for pain on a lot of people. But they'll get the price up to where you can't afford it.
3277 2018-07-19 17:08:51 Wouldnt there be some cool pictures if the spotters were allowed in one day.
3278 2018-07-19 17:08:46 There's no explaining away ripping health care away from millions and giving a trillion dollar handout to the top 1%. Missourians aren't buying the snake oil @VP is selling today, and we aren't buying his hand-picked corporate candidate either.

Jus met my neighbour
His daughter was diagnosed with inoperable brain cancer
So he's been microdosing her with cannabis oil

She's in her 20's and has a wee baby
Hurrah
3281 2018-07-19 17:08:35 All that oil and water beneath their feet for millennia & they did nothing?
They could have dug a well for the water.
As for the oil, the Brits/Americans/Chinese (or whoever first started drilling) figured out how to do it. They didn’t wait around for Tullow/Total to show up!

3287 2018-07-19 17:08:11 I want to try that CBD oil that they use for seizures but it's like 150 bucks a bottle if you get the stuff that actually works. Just haven't had the money for it, buying flower is expensive but not that expensive lol

3290 2018-07-19 17:07:45 Do they? Maybe we feel entitled because we have oil but do we deserve it, with our current behavior and mindset? I dont see we do. We reap what we sow. We sow corruption we reap death and misery.

3293 2018-07-19 17:07:20 I'll answer that for you, when the Venezuelan government depends solely on oil, doesn't diversify, nationalizes industries and companies big and small, over inflates their currency, enacts wage and price controls. Not very difficult to figure out.
3294 2018-07-19 17:07:18 Okay could we see the non oil values of GDP then then things some

3300 2018-07-19 17:06:23 Cynical me: Its not a liquidation. Rather its a transfer to #Putin & his pals private accounts. #Russia gas station economy stinks and was looted. Russia buying #gold for that day when oil goes down and they can no longer hide.

3305 2018-07-19 17:05:33 Blame regulations. The fact that the state regulated oil drillers to drill far shore rather in shallow areas.

3319 2018-07-19 17:04:13 Ach, there’s a very grim irony to living in one of the world’s most advanced economies, with one of the largest oil and gas producing sectors, yet still having to consider stockpiling tinned food. 
It’s almost as if we’re about to lose a war, have already lost a war

3321 2018-07-19 17:04:02 Two questions for you if you are brave and honest enough to answer
1) Would scots be better off with 100% of oil revenues or 8%?
2) Do you think scots are wrong to want to run their own country?
I look forward to your replies

3343 2018-07-19 17:02:04 Trouble is many dentists promote brands full of sweeteners, and think that mouthwashes etc are great. Did you think your paste did a good job Lesley? And did it include coconut oil for emollience?

3345 2018-07-19 17:01:55 its not secondary, if oil was removed from Earth out right tomorrow billions would starve to death.  Almost everything would stop functioning / being made.

3367 2018-07-19 16:59:53 yes we were,,then when oil came WM showed its true self by taking 92% of scots oil revenues,leaving scots with 8% of their own resource.

3379 2018-07-19 16:59:24 My daughter's car was leaking fluid like crazy. Took it to mechanic. Turns out when she got her oil changed at @pepboysauto  they did not tighten the new oil filter. Oil sprayed all over the engine. What a mess.
3380 2018-07-19 16:59:15 Data has shown that Nigeria hasn't made any meaningful impact in the oil sector since 1980.

We have been stuck inbtwn 1-2mbd since the 80s.

Meanwhile the US have been recording systemic growth I'm the oil sector since 2008. Today they are doing 11mbd, closely behind Russia 11.2

3393 2018-07-19 16:57:57 @sabre666 Dude, I am long oil I think it will be higher at the end of the year but we are going lower first. 65 possibly lower before 80.
3394 2018-07-19 16:57:51 Actually Russia's economy is largely dependent on oil and gas exports.  The higher the prices and the more they export, the more cash they have.  This is part of the reason why the President called out Germany for getting their gas from Russia plus being able to shut the valve.

3403 2018-07-19 16:57:02 Coconut oil can be really heavy, so it doesn't agree with everyone. I tried various oils and whatnot and the BEST thing that seems to make the most potent edibles, is good old-fashioned butter. I use Challenge Unsalted butter.

3416 2018-07-19 16:55:11 The Canadian government still makes money from it. I know that oil companies won't unless forced to, but that doesn't mean Canada itself won't make money from the pipeline that will in turn pay for other things.
3417 2018-07-19 16:55:06 Yeah, the army tests it’s oil—civilian and military vehicles—and has basically arrived at the same conclusion.... car companies suggest oil changes at intervals that are completely unnecessary and a way to make extra money on a car sale.
3418 2018-07-19 16:55:05 Tory neoliberal policies resulted in
•A widening of the gap between the very rich and the poor ;failure of its  ‘trickle down’ economic theories.
•A squandering of the assets from North Sea Oil.
•The creation of Tax Havens and Tax Avoidance.
•The Banking collapse of 2007-8

3559 2018-07-19 16:41:41 Always for you Sexy I might get the oil out again tonight 
3560 2018-07-19 16:41:32 Just like oil.

パーマ大佐サインステッカーおめでとうございます
3564 2018-07-19 16:41:07 Have you seen good results? I was looking into purchasing a new oil.
3565 2018-07-19 16:41:00 Spot prices are up, yet futures from October  on are down significantly. This indicates that longer term oil is going sideways and it is bearish for stocks.
3566 2018-07-19 16:40:53 Cleansing oil boleh buat muka breakout tak? How to find a suitable one kalau mcm tu. hehe
3567 2018-07-19 16:40:40 You should store your CBD oil in a different drawer then and stop letting them bogart it. Give your socks a turn!

3571 2018-07-19 16:40:38 I rather pay that then a gas or an oil bill

3575 2018-07-19 16:40:23 He must mean she’s naive for her to talk so openly about corruption affecting the policy positions of our elected officials who are supposed to represent the people and not big oil or corporations.
3576 2018-07-19 16:40:18 I agree, but not sure those that have interests in car sales, oil etc care much for savings for the NHS. Savings for a largely public owned organisation have little influence on capital investors. I'm sure it is common and can well believe has little impact as article suggests

3587 2018-07-19 16:39:45 Oh yeah forgot about that artifact I mostly been upgrading my looting artifacts I got oil loot at a strong 19%. Like this guy flew over a level 5 bomber and took all the available oil to loot(4000) so I attacked back and took his oil (5000) lol got a 1000 oil profit yep he's mad
3588 2018-07-19 16:39:42 How old was the pipe in the ground and when did Predator Oil Ltd last pig the line. Was it originally someone else's line?
3589 2018-07-19 16:39:39 I got scammed to buying a R89.90 bath ball because it has chamomile & lavender oil 
3590 2018-07-19 16:39:35 Think the Oil would do that?
3591 2018-07-19 16:39:25 put on body oil after u shave i s2g the softness is unparalleled

3594 2018-07-19 16:38:26 Mom really is telling me I’m not allowed to use insurance to go to the doctor when I can’t hear on my right side until I put every cooking oil under the sun in my ear because the internet told her that’ll cure me
3595 2018-07-19 16:38:21 He thinks Ppl listens to his advice. Oil parties are not saints.. All play their own game to win over others. 
Its different from a ldrless Crowd..
3596 2018-07-19 16:38:20 Here's a home remedy I like to use for sun blisters:
Add six drops of tea tree essential oil to 3 tsp of coconut oil. Put it on the blistered areas and let it dry. You should reapply it 2 to 3 times a day. It should help heal the blisters and keep your skin cool and hydrated. 
3597 2018-07-19 16:38:14 WTI oil at $68.36, -$0.40.
3598 2018-07-19 16:38:01 i do boxing, or running, even long walks -- anything that tires me out that I can't think too deeply. But it's super temp. Full proof for me is taking CBD oil, it always helps calm me down when the mind runs rampant. 
good luck!
3599 2018-07-19 16:37:57 Well, they're wrong. We're a social democracy. Currently on our 5th consecutive year with a conservative government. We made the right choice in taxing our oil industry heavily for using national resources. That's why we're rich.
3600 2018-07-19 16:37:35 Bitumen has more uses and byproducts than sweet oil. Potential markets are large.
3601 2018-07-19 16:37:24 I cry olive oil tears 
3602 2018-07-19 16:37:19 Corn, wine, and oil; and, from the herd or flock,
3603 2018-07-19 16:37:18 These people are so tedious. "Seems like we're due," as if we're talking about an oil change.
3604 2018-07-19 16:37:13 Seems clear to me. I can't understand why they don't see this.
Strong confirmation bias at work for some. I suspect others are tied to oil or legacy auto makers and are afraid to lose income.
3605 2018-07-19 16:37:01 Sir we not promoting companies enough to beat Google microft boeing or amazon. We need big moves. Merger of banks to create only 5 world class banks. Merger of oil companies into 1 mega oil gas and marketing company. One mega listed telecom. 1 Airlines Co. Is must. @PMOIndia
3606 2018-07-19 16:36:59 You know what that black/carbon beer reminds me of? When my car started to have knocks and bangs, and I went to change the oil and it was black with shimmering metal bits in it, and I knew my engine was completely toast.
3607 2018-07-19 16:36:54 I continually have vetting calls with up and coming DevOps companies, and... yeah, a lot of it is snake oil.  Worse, it's the exact same snake oil over and over again, but they don't seem to notice.
3608 2018-07-19 16:36:47 Guess the pedophile fathers must have sprayed the oil by mistake while using it!
3609 2018-07-19 16:36:47 I don’t follow any specific recipes. Usually celery, cabbage, ginger, turmeric, lemon, apple, kale, Oregano oil, cayenne. Amounts vary. 
3610 2018-07-19 16:36:40 This new lip oil from @ultabeauty got me poppin rn

3612 2018-07-19 16:36:23 Nothing like working in oil and gas for the first time to make a person feel completely inept. No idea what anyone is talking about 
3613 2018-07-19 16:36:23 Oh my love just think of the cancer patients that have no hair and be thankful for dry hair  Plus a hair oil treatment 
3614 2018-07-19 16:36:17 Fun fact; it’s the washingit everyday that makes it so greasy, the hair speeds up oil production to make up for all the oil being washed off
3615 2018-07-19 16:36:05 Should Santa Barbara County allow ExxonMobil to truck crude oil from its offshore platforms through the county?
3616 2018-07-19 16:36:00 Happy mistake cross cause I lost the mom she made more oil than any other including our glue
3617 2018-07-19 16:35:57 WRONG! My Cambrian countertop Chipped in several area. Also oil penetrated. I am very disappointed on my choice.
3618 2018-07-19 16:35:36 On the issue of trucks transporting oil, Mr. Mbote, the OML boss has, mutually agreed to give the community some trucks. The East side, Nakukulas are sorted but the issue is with the South, Lokichar brokers. Some want all the trucks alone. But it should be evenly distributed.
3619 2018-07-19 16:35:18 Where are his tax returns? He is conspiring with Russia. Ended agreement with Iran to help Russia by increasing price of oil. Trying to dissolve NATO. Just be honest. You want the US to be a dictatorship tied to Russia. It's ok if you hate the US and want a fascist state instead.
3620 2018-07-19 16:35:05 obviously... "extra-virgin" olive oil
3621 2018-07-19 16:35:03 Very positive!! America doesn't need oil from other terrorist countries.
3622 2018-07-19 16:34:51 Oil is neutral no? 
3623 2018-07-19 16:34:48 olive oil is not bad, maybe we could export "virgin oil" to Italy.
3624 2018-07-19 16:34:47 Omg my ipsy bag this month is fire i got a full size smashbox concelear, lipgloss, and a nice face all natural oil  omg my day is gonna be great

3626 2018-07-19 16:34:42 A3: I think the future is flex models, not remote models. Collaboration, teamwork - those are still vital. But ppl need to be able to bring their kid to the dr, get an oil change, recharge at home. Workplaces that accommodate that will be more successful.  #idgtechtalk

3632 2018-07-19 16:33:35 Tea tree oil is BAE.
3633 2018-07-19 16:33:33 Absolutely Agreed.
Oil exploration was never done initially

But given innumerable technologies available, using local resources will create local jobs and employment
3634 2018-07-19 16:33:29 The delayed reaction is typical.  It takes the oil awhile to penetrate the skin. Cortizone 10 helps with the itching.
3635 2018-07-19 16:33:20 Kalau lidah buaya yg dari pohonnya langsung harus dibilas nanti gatel dan gaboleh lama2 didieminnya cukup sejam. Kalau olive oil sebenernya jg gt karena kadang kalau bilasnya gabersih jadi ketombean dan cepet bgt lepek rambutnya.

Anyways, I wish Nigeria air success.
3639 2018-07-19 16:33:02 U.S. THE Super Power is risking war with a Nuclear country, only sells gas/oil which will become obsolete as soon as those who r forward looking make renewable energies available. W/all due respect,since u've been in Senate,Reps. have done little 2 protect U.S. SHAME
3640 2018-07-19 16:32:59 I’m originally from India. Cutting out sugar and potatoes, eating lower-carb veggies like cabbage and cauliflower, and using only ghee or coconut oil (no Dalda, for example) will help. If it can’t be ideal, it can be better.
3641 2018-07-19 16:32:53 this woman spews the same garbage talking points every time. Energy East will build the Canadian economy not virtue signaling taxes used to bankroll you supporters. she is either very stupid or corrupt. Canadian oil Canadian jobs.

Facts: approved arms deal to Ukraine (obama wouldn’t), ended Iran deal (Russia liked deal), increasing NATO spending (Russia hates that), pushing Germany to stop buying Russian oil (backbone of economy).

3646 2018-07-19 16:32:27 In my view none off what the oil company is doing is legal. The people of Bismarck didn't want the pipeline so Standing Rock Reservation was next door.
If Bismarck has the right to turn it down why hasn't SR surely this is discrimination. I believe Trump is a shareholder.
3647 2018-07-19 16:32:25 Nobody told me that most Peanut butters contain Palm oil

3650 2018-07-19 16:32:04 Carbon tax probably does not reduce carbon emissions.That's my opinion. Do you care about how much oil costs for your car? company? probably not!

3655 2018-07-19 16:31:29 Oil is back down to $68, and it might go lower as Trump pushes the Arabs and threatens to open the reserve. 

Pump prices will fall, inflation will remain in line around 2%. Voters will feel better about gas prices as the summer progresses. #MAGA
3656 2018-07-19 16:31:23 I’m 2,000 miles over an oil change. I feel like I just changed it 
3657 2018-07-19 16:31:18 The February one is usually more busy but you just never know. Last time I was stuck on the fryer for 8 hours straight and I seriously thought about dunking my head in the oil

3660 2018-07-19 16:30:49 Really annoying when dudes in auto parts stores talk to me like I have no clue what I’m doing. It’s pretty consistent and I’m done with it.

Today I went to pick up oil for an oil change. I’ve periodically tested the oil in this Jeep since I bought it in 2006, which includes...
3661 2018-07-19 16:30:47 well first that my friend Leslie and second she’s rubbing in tanning oil sir
3662 2018-07-19 16:30:43  I've used " the oil is not good oil " as if I know how to tap palm oil . 
3663 2018-07-19 16:30:40 Hey girl! That happened to me a couple years ago and every once in a which I get a flare up. What helped me was to completely stop wearing makeup for at least 2 weeks and to use coconut oil to moisturize my eyelids. I hope that somewhat helps! I know how devastating it is

3666 2018-07-19 16:30:10 CBD oil for pets?
3667 2018-07-19 16:30:01 I have asked myself that question, the answer I came up with was , in 2014 if Scotland had voted for independence the Tory government would have been happy. When the crude oil price fell they would have been elated . 1/2
3668 2018-07-19 16:29:58 So your still supporting tories,,right wing tories at that,,over the people of Scotland running their own country?

3678 2018-07-19 16:28:29 I made an appointment. There’s no way it should take an hour to change my oil.
3679 2018-07-19 16:28:06 Yam and tomatoes and onions are sold with a higher prize like oil , we should ask ourselves where did we go wrong
3680 2018-07-19 16:27:58 Belief never hurt anyone.

3696 2018-07-19 16:26:51 1 thing that is absolutely epic about being part of transformational projects is that u embed yourself in & gain so much knowledge about the context.

Some of the red sauce (presumably straight Frank's with no soybean oil) was consumed.
None of the white sauce (presumably ranch or blue cheese "dressing" made from soybean oil) was consumed.
3752 2018-07-19 16:21:16 Didn't work for me either. I tried everything from face wash, toner, skin oil and creams. Just wasn't cut for me and it's sad to see people enjoying the benefits
3753 2018-07-19 16:21:12 I used to use baking soda and coconut oil, but my dentist was horrified so I haven’t used it since. Check with your dentist- it was the baking soda that caused him to be horrified.

3755 2018-07-19 16:21:06 The amount of gas flared by these oil companies is getting too much, i thought there was a law that prohibited this.

3772 2018-07-19 16:19:05 We can build a oil pipeline in months but can't build a water pipline in a year? Just build a filtered, process pipeline for clean water to middle of town. Then branch it off. People can come for water, good Samaritan neighbors can get for others #FlintWaterCrisis #LargeWaterhose
3773 2018-07-19 16:18:58 Russia is not a pressing threat to the US. Its network of alliances is nowhere near as robust. Its economy is heavily dependent on oil at a time when green energy is becoming more prevalent by the day. 

Know what is a threat? Climate change, inequality, $ in politics, fascism.

3777 2018-07-19 16:18:37 It's actually not hard to do.  They can still use the same herbs and spices but instead of chicken they can use soya.  They could use panko breading.  Panko is lighter and flakier than regular breadcrumbs, it's perfect for fried foods, as it absorbs less oil and grease.

3788 2018-07-19 16:17:21 It's all amazing. Think Levant food, but with less olive oil and WAY more lemon.

There's plenty of good food near the event, but it's all stuff you could find a better version of in NY. Babani's is unique.
3789 2018-07-19 16:17:16 Having water full of oil spills and coal plant waste is something you like to brag about? Making the world worse for YOUR children is the hill you want to defend? You're simply an evil, greedy, terrible person.
3790 2018-07-19 16:16:44 I feel oil will breakout on the downside and mid-small caps on the upside simultaneously.
3791 2018-07-19 16:16:44 Oil well
3792 2018-07-19 16:16:33 In other words this men are going to salvage Nigeria and Nigerians from over dependent on oil as major revenue earner...congratulations and GOD'S speed.
3793 2018-07-19 16:16:26 The Irish, and indeed the Japanese might have something to say about the whisky. And the way things are going, Scotland won't be part of the UK for much longer anyway, which rules that out, along with most of the oil.
3794 2018-07-19 16:16:24 #dharmendrapradhan why do CNG outlets in Mumbai seek higher side of the bill even though consumers pay by Bank Credit or Debit card which is illegal and huge windfall of profit to the Oil companies

3797 2018-07-19 16:16:04 Debating personalities is a cover-up distraction from examining the efficacy of policies of the SYSTEM itself. Check into $4 Bil. oil co. deals made with Biden's son during Ukraine kerfuffle, & of what neo-nazi stripes the so-called rebels were...makes quite a different picture!
3798 2018-07-19 16:15:58 I can answer. 1) Putin gets a west-wing office 2) US leaves NATO 3) We'll only buy Russian oil.  4) US won't interfere with Russian aggression in Europe or Asia.

3825 2018-07-19 16:12:58 @SKODAUK it would appear my Skoda dealership has filled my 2017 Fabia 1.2 TSI (on fixed servicing) with 504 00 (long life) oil at service despite my handbook stating it should have 502 00 oil. Could you please clarify the requirements.
3826 2018-07-19 16:12:48 Worked with a woman who picked up an new pre-owned car from a dealer. It seized up on her as she was getting on the expressway. Turns out they put the oil in the cooling system & the coolant in the oil pan.

3831 2018-07-19 16:12:13 What’s more puzzling is how you thought it would stay as ice even though the oil is hot enough to fry in, fried water?

3835 2018-07-19 16:11:35 I think it was transmission oil. There was lots of overlapping talk. I think Sam said she has her transmission fixed.
3836 2018-07-19 16:11:24 Yup. 
Speculators, however, have had this oil pumped, shipped and stored, many times over.

3864 2018-07-19 16:07:36 Although oil prices fell, other consumer goods did not follow suit, driving inflation up. That along with a weak ringgit tightened the public's disposable income, which made the introduction of the GST regime incredibly unpopular at the time.

3867 2018-07-19 16:07:10 Timing: GST in Malaysia was introduced on 1 April 2015, about a year after oil prices started decreasing. Falling oil prices meant less gov spending on subsidies and controlled prices, since the gov's rev was so dependant on PETRONAS at the time.

3885 2018-07-19 16:05:39 Just a joke. The left bottle is the hottest sauce on earth, leading to pain/fear, so the bottle in the middle is cannabis oil, to calm me; then, when fire  comes out my butt, the CBD cream can numb me.

3900 2018-07-19 16:03:42 It's bribe in form of purchase, so that USA doesn't interfere in general election and not to obstruct s400 missile deal and Iran's oil supply.
3901 2018-07-19 16:03:37 Didn't entice me at all either, but since she bought it and it was cheap, I bought one too. Thought it wouldn't hurt me coz it's just OIL. How wrong I was 
3902 2018-07-19 16:03:17 I think we'll be okay, they're made here. We can use rapeseed oil and local flour and eggs for the batter.

Probably an EU Directive against it then...
3903 2018-07-19 16:03:07 I picked up my pre-fast food today. Before every 25 hour fast I have an avocado with olive oil, lots of Gatorade and a tablespoon of honey. Maybe I am wrong, but I feel it makes the fast easier.

3917 2018-07-19 16:01:23 And this, despite having similar European background and traditions. The melting pot of today seems to be more of an oil/water "self segregating" concoction.

3971 2018-07-19 15:55:19 Dead easy. Stuffing mix B40 from Tesco. Not too bad. Made balls with left over and sprayed with a bit of oil to airfry.
3972 2018-07-19 15:55:14 And if somebody says they got it for the low, then it ain’t real oil.
3973 2018-07-19 15:55:12 I always suggest putting pepper oil on plants that bugs mess with. Like pepper / peppermint extract is very strong and often deters pests without hurting your produce. And it's all natural! Just be extremely careful if you have pets. Oil extracts can be poisonous to them.

3977 2018-07-19 15:54:52 Republicans are very comfortable with other forms of death: eating meat, driving cars, oil wars, death penalty, police shootings. They just decide that this form of death is unacceptable because they want to control women.

Is Nigeria "oil rich"?

3984 2018-07-19 15:54:02 Espresso Balsamic Vinegar is in!  The Espresso Balsamic Vinegar so rich and chocolate-y with flavors of dark roast coffee and the sweet tartness of an aged dark balsamic vinegar. Great paired with our Rosemary Olive Oil!
3985 2018-07-19 15:54:01 Do you have a chat room  jk
3986 2018-07-19 15:53:56 Putin needs higher oil/gas prices to keep Russian economy afloat.  This conflicts with Trump’s need to keep domestic prices low.
3987 2018-07-19 15:53:49 Well should National Security outweigh their oil, money, and influence since they were actually involved in 9/11.
3988 2018-07-19 15:53:35 And when it comes to spending we cannot compare ourselves to city. We make transfers with money that the club makes. City have oil rich owners that are able to pump their money into the club. We cannot keep up with their spending, we just have to match them on the pitch.
3989 2018-07-19 15:53:31 Someone has to be the punster - was it extra virgin olive oil?
3990 2018-07-19 15:53:25 Anybody who claims people should not buy an electric vehicle until the electricity grid is cleaned up, please hold internal combustion engines to the same standard - don’t buy them until oil or other fossil fuel production and processing is cleaned up.
3991 2018-07-19 15:53:09 If your skin is feeling extra dry use a body oil instead of a lotion.

3993 2018-07-19 15:52:44 My understanding is that, after surveys of the waters around the Falkland Islands, completed in the 1950's, it was thought then and now proved correct, the seabed is rich in minerals and oil deposits, that's what the war was all about.

They’re both unregulated, unlicensed knockoffs!

Is that why nothing is done about the rickshaws?
3997 2018-07-19 15:52:12 IEA says refinery run rate will be up 2 MBD in third quarter. OPEC is not interested to supply more oil. So who will supply this?
3998 2018-07-19 15:52:05 I want to learn how to cook and bake with it. The leaves, seeds, and make the oil homemade. (My husband has MS.) I hope all of NJ will follow suit. It's a natural solution (*and possible cure even), for so many diseases.

4005 2018-07-19 15:51:37 Fracking poisons the land. We need to wean off fossil fuels and Republicans are too closely associated with oil & gas to move forward on this. All those pipelines being placed under freshwater bodies will leak. We know that. But peeps still see a good side to this.

4011 2018-07-19 15:50:46 2. How many laws are really "made in Brussels"? Not the majority of UK law, by any sensible count. And many of those laws enact things which actually don't affect us (like rules on olive oil production) but which need passing as part of the single market.

4053 2018-07-19 15:45:09 This is why govt should have stopped signing 10/15% oil contracts and Gnpc be actively involved after the second contract to benefit more from the funds.

4054 2018-07-19 15:45:01 Under OBJ & GEJ NGR earned billions of $$$ from oil, sold most of state assets to cronies under questionable privatization, awash in cash they couldn't even build our roads let alone railways or ports because they were busy buying Hilton, building libraries etc

4059 2018-07-19 15:44:54 It will never happen because the Republicans and the President are in the pockets of big oil and coal.   They do not want their business to go away.

4106 2018-07-19 15:41:02 The Exfoliating Brown Sugar Scrub Mask
2 tsp of brown sugar
2 tsp of virgin coconut oil
Use equal parts brown sugar and coconut oil to form an easy scrub, apply it on your face in gentle circular motions, let it sink in for a few minutes and wash it off with warm water.
4107 2018-07-19 15:40:56 Fish Oil Pills
To nourish the skin thoroughly, taking healthy necessary foods and supplements is important. Some oils also work best when taken internally.  Studies show fish oils such as Cod liver oil can help in soothing the dry skin, mainly owing to its omega 3 acids.

4109 2018-07-19 15:40:47 Cbd oil for physical pain, headaches, anxiety.  Thoughts? Has anyone tried it?

4112 2018-07-19 15:40:40 While I don’t doubt, and even suspected in the beginning, that Tillerson was Putin’s choice because of the sanction/oil issues, this article and source is less than ideal and I’ve grown knee jerk leery of sources that contain misspellings and sensational advertisements.1/

4130 2018-07-19 15:39:08 my mom thought the highlighter on my face was OIL and she out here recommending stuff to get rid of it smh
4131 2018-07-19 15:38:58 But keep the oil. Right?
4132 2018-07-19 15:38:53 I’ve been dunking on oil companies a lot lately and here’s some more:
4133 2018-07-19 15:38:53 @khoslaventures Oil "The Tear of the Buddha" is the most significant discovery in the field of healthy nutrition. The oil is always fresh, has antibacterial, anti-inflammatory properties. Stimulates the healing processes of damaged tissues. Consumers - 40 million elderly people.
4134 2018-07-19 15:38:51 Many conservatives are absolutely on board with carbon pricing. Oil companies too. Lead the way .@MA_Senate .@SpeakerDeLeo #https://loe.org/shows/segments.html?programID=18-P13-00027&segmentID=#WhyWeWontRest
4135 2018-07-19 15:38:37 I'm not saying 11B is acceptable... I'm saying it's the cost of doing business.  Alberta's population whines about taxes, then whines about services when they're not funded due to lack of money.

We rode too high, too long on oil money... Can't have it both ways.
4136 2018-07-19 15:38:36 @globalnews #edmontonmorningshow. The oil workers of Alberta enjoyed your little blurb about the injured workers who were affected by the H2S release at the Edmonton refinery the other day. The interesting part of the story was how you mentioned that production was not affected.
4137 2018-07-19 15:38:34 With help from the sold puppet Tsipras and his fascist government they are selling out Greece to the banksters , they gave away the name Macedonia  , oil deposits found in the Mediterranean
,  taxes and more taxes , it is a terrible situation .
4138 2018-07-19 15:38:30 My dumb ass mixed tanning oil and baby oil together,  and now I have to stay home for 3 days bc my skin is covered in a rash !

4140 2018-07-19 15:38:17 RenCap fair value estimate of the local currency is N322 to $1 versus its current spot price of N361 to $1. They think Naira will rally towards the end of the year. I hope DT behave sha...all is riding on the price of oil.
4141 2018-07-19 15:38:14 @BrandiKruse maybe have the mayor explain how she plans on enforcing this? Another non common sense gun infringement.  Stealing, murder, and assault are all against the law, how is this going to stop criminals? What if they get into my quick safe and steal my gun and use it?
4142 2018-07-19 15:38:14 olive oil? God the Father, God the Son, God the holy Hummus?
4143 2018-07-19 15:38:09 No makeup remover? No worries! Grab extra virgin olive oil out of your kitchen! Olive oil is natural, moisturizing &amp; will remove makeup.
4144 2018-07-19 15:38:07 Mr President don't forget the mess in Venezuela. They are mixed in there and can do A LOT to get rid of that problem, right here in our hemisphere. Don't let the Russians take the largest oil reserves in the world 2 hours plane ride from Miami...it would be a costly mistake.

4147 2018-07-19 15:37:45 Self-Help tips are like coconut oil. If it works for you, great! BUT if you know your body isn’t going to work well with it...why would you still slather yourself in coconut oil hoping for the results someone on Twitter told you would happen?
4148 2018-07-19 15:37:38 Make salad dressing! Mix 3 parts grape seed oil with 1 part white wine vinegar and 1 part avocado. Add paprika and coconut sugar to taste.
4149 2018-07-19 15:37:33 Yes. All true. Russia got access to Exxon Oil field. Time for Tillerson to go...his job was done.
4150 2018-07-19 15:37:28  Tell that to the children who have to practice oil and gas evacuation drills in case of explosions, fires or spills. No. Mega pads concentrated in residential areas is the industrialization of CO. When you go bust, we’ll have a wasteland. #orphanwells #frachits
4151 2018-07-19 15:37:18 And as he's shown that he stands with Putin, and not with us, guess who else you're standing with?
Oil up those gears...you have much back pedaling to do.

Yeah, we knew. The signs were there to all who didn't willfully turn blind eyes.

Alberta has had the best economy in Canada under the NDP, and the price of oil has had VERY little to do with it.

4215 2018-07-19 15:31:34 Honestly delicious. 12 grain bread, smashed avocado, drizzle of olive oil, red pepper flakes, kosher salt, and squeeze of lemon.

Tapi kalau kamu mau agak cerahan, sy rekomendasi nivea extra white yang radiant & smooth/yg lain dari series ini, yg oil hanya bikin lembab di sy.[]

4236 2018-07-19 15:28:59 Hai, Tania.

Bisa dong.

Syaratnya gini aja. Jenis kulit kamu kan dry, artinya harus pakai cleansing oil/milk cleanser yang ditujukan khusus untuk kulit dry. Face washnya juga untuk yang dry.

Insya Allah nggak akan bikin wajah kamu kering kalau pilih produknya tepat.
4237 2018-07-19 15:28:58 Before crude oil we were feeding on oil palm, farming, fishing and after oil our environment have been destroyed by exploration and production.

Resources control would turn us into paradise like Houston Texas, Aberdeen, Dubai, Muscat, Bahrain etc. FG do the needful
4238 2018-07-19 15:28:57 In that case, just replace it with organic coconut oil, avocado oil, and almond milk! Toooooooottally works. My grandma on my dad's mom's side said so.

4240 2018-07-19 15:28:37 Market update: price increase.

Today the underlying price for Gas Oil has risen over 0.7PPL so far today. This is due to a decrease in production of Natural Gas and Saudi Arabia saying they won’t oversupply the market.
4241 2018-07-19 15:28:27 seriously, i’m done with it y’all. pinterest is not a university. you should only be taking your skincare advice from a dermatologist, esthetician/skincare specialist. it will take years and $ for me to undo the damage coconut oil & ACV is doing to your face.
4242 2018-07-19 15:28:27 Why not simply ban plastic products or would that upset the oil industries?

4249 2018-07-19 15:28:01 There's nothing too much or too high for city as they have loads of oil money
4250 2018-07-19 15:27:58 So abolishing private property would've solved all the problems the country is facing? The government siezed Venezuela's oil production, their biggest export, and then ruined it. I'd say they went pretty far with abolishing private property and it failed.

4263 2018-07-19 15:26:39 Speaking of infrastructure problems, I was on the phone with my mentor a few weeks ago and he said, “Dan, ever since the beginning of the oil industry we’ve had issues getting oil out,” when I asked him about the Permian bottleneck & how it’s affecting him.
4264 2018-07-19 15:26:23 Sorry to tell you libs but Colorado's history includes an oil boom and you know what else there is a giant swatch of land east of I-25 that is also Colorado its not just Denver and ski slopes

4266 2018-07-19 15:26:20 We have a engine that doesn't consume gasoline. But that Re-generating electric design has purposely been sitting on a shelf. Only so that foreign big oil can still finance it's own covert terror operations designed to control a consumer.. (along those lines)

4278 2018-07-19 15:25:00 yes and no. I have been on low carbs too and I agree that it works. However, I can attest this works too! What has changed from this to now is my perception of what is fatty food. Not oil or butter but roasted carbs where the fibre has been destroyed. Will add that bit in. Thanks

4283 2018-07-19 15:24:23 I seriously love coconut oil!!!
4284 2018-07-19 15:24:20 Yes but you should always add a little olive oil or the pasta will get sticky.

4288 2018-07-19 15:24:05 It'd probably even be profitable and would help reduce CO2 emissions for the country, but no, no we aren't getting it. On the plus side we got an oil pipeline.

¯\_(ツ)_/¯
4289 2018-07-19 15:24:00 Where is Tillerson these days anyway? Over in Russia trying to figure out how to move Roseneft oil since Trump failed to get approval to sell half the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve and failed to get Saudi Arabia to break OPEC rules by doubling production? Follow the money.
4290 2018-07-19 15:23:58 It's not like the US destablizing/attacking entire countries either because they dislike the current government (a sliver to the left of the US Democrats = too left wing -> RAMPANT COMMUNISM!!!) or because oil or because subversion on behalf of Russia is anything new.

4292 2018-07-19 15:23:37 The only surprise surrounding the US Dollar’s upward surge over the last few months is how strong oil has remained in the face of it!

4294 2018-07-19 15:23:23 As an Italian: salt the water when it starts boiling, and once the pasta it’s done add olive oil.
4295 2018-07-19 15:23:10 Opposing carbon tax is a national security threat , look at the the deaths from the Montreal heat wave , corp oil terrorism is real and among the Sask Government, your primary objective is fostering Hemp industry applied to hemp carbon capacitor tech, this is grand architecture .
4296 2018-07-19 15:23:09 Another challenge: presentation by RSPO that their process and membership is appropriately meaningful regarding the production of palm oil in truly ecologically sensitive and sustainable fashion. Not currently adequately presented/claimed/marketable.
4297 2018-07-19 15:23:08 My husband works in the oil and gas industry so yes, 100%, those in the industry knew the minute he was elected it would turn it around and they called the very next day.  Huge huge huge for everyone in this industry, coal, manufacturing. Hence the massive red swath across the US

4305 2018-07-19 15:22:23 Look Henderson, we are Albertans and that means we are white, have an oversized black pick up and are primary concern is the profitability of giant oil companies based out of Texas. Also some of us have confederate flags for some reason that totally isn’t racist.

4310 2018-07-19 15:21:54 Sounds interesting! What are the rules? Are you allowed to add any spices you want? And can you add other things afar from those 5 ingredients? (Like water, oil,...)
4311 2018-07-19 15:21:52 Ninguna, el tarifazo es porque se dejó de invertir en energía, y hoy se importa gas y fuel oil, por subsidiar muchas veces a quien no lo merecía

4320 2018-07-19 15:21:10 Of course they did. As soon as they did I said he was Putin’s pick - follow the oil (money). What I’d like to know is why Putin wanted Pence.

4324 2018-07-19 15:20:39 I’m glad you limit this to the UK experience. Nationalized assets in the oil producing countries is a different experience in the main. Norway being a prime example.

4327 2018-07-19 15:20:25 Oil and gas companies pass taxes on to consumers in the form of higher prices. Just compare the price of gas in PA to any other state.

You aren't making companies pay their fair share. You're hiding the fact that you're really taxing consumers.

4345 2018-07-19 15:18:06 Russia is definitely not a big guy.  Russia has nothing to offer to offer the world except oil.

4348 2018-07-19 15:18:00 Which I agree with you, but the issue with Iraq wasn't that it was a bold face like, it's that it turned out to be a lie, something we all fell for. Hence the issues we have now today, but it's more complicated than oil.

4353 2018-07-19 15:17:27 Right.. The high rollers in America today are members of Islamic oligarchy. Funny how all the Arab oil profits since the early 70s have been utilized to 'buy out' USA. We paid for our own demise. And now, islam is never mentioned. That's a big Mistake for common freedom.

4360 2018-07-19 15:16:35 About time, really... There's enough of us to cater for and we always try to avoid palm oil as well, so this is welcome news! 
4361 2018-07-19 15:16:32 We should ban plastics, and replace it with rubber. And we should have oil drums full of petrol instead of public waste bins. Then we could burn all of our rubbish, sending huge billowing smoke clouds into the sky like some post apocalyptical scene from Mad Max. I like Mad Max

Expanding NATO coffers
Scolding NATO countries for buying Russian oil

- Alternating lifting with yoga

4390 2018-07-19 15:12:39 I’ve had several conversations on here where people are mad at companies like BP and Shell for getting involved in green energy. I can’t stop thinking, what do you want them to do, carry on with oil alone?

4393 2018-07-19 15:12:19 So I’m sitting at the car dealership while my oil is being changed, and this older gentleman’s phone starts to ring. 
And his ringtone is JINGLE BELLS. 
And he DIDNT ANSWER. 
And the person CALLED BACK. TWICE. 
So I’ve listened to Jingle Bells three times today Merry Christmas

4399 2018-07-19 15:11:20 Why do they schedule me for an oil change when they know that FIVE lifts are blocked off for painting of the garage floor?  Like I don’t mind waiting two hours for something that should take 20-minutes.

4405 2018-07-19 15:10:58 In part, yes the rebound in oil prices has definately helped get people back to work- thank goodness! But Fed/Prov Gov programs and initiatives have also contributed significantly. Also, we need to stop the boom/bust cycle and diversify.
4406 2018-07-19 15:10:57 You on some other shit you the oil tho ?
4407 2018-07-19 15:10:54 My advice, just attend A school that teaches supply/demand candle formations- Problem Solved - oil, technically easiest to trade
4408 2018-07-19 15:10:52 Don't add olive oil while boiling your pasta, I beg you, please don't do this ;-;
4409 2018-07-19 15:10:47 Ah the typical #CON condescension in place of a source...big surprise there. Many oil companies have gone bankrupt during the past 40yrs. So try again, bankruptcies are not unique to the #NDP or #ableg ffs. Those companies you mentioned left ABn’s w/$millions in clean up.

4416 2018-07-19 15:09:38 #oilandgasisnotcolorado BS that oil is not Colorado. Either you people are not from here or you don't know the history of this state. CO 3 booms gold silver and oil all 3 along with ranching/farming made this state. Oil is used for pretty much eveything you cherish
4417 2018-07-19 15:09:35 What happens when their Dictator makes a deal with one of our little lefty dictators to give all of their oil to the American 'needy'!!
Thank a Kennedy senor!
Joe-for-oil.. sure..
4418 2018-07-19 15:09:30 @hickforco Gov. Hickenlooper, I absolutely agree with you on orphaned drill sites. We need to require the Oil Companies to have committed money to clean up if they get to drill in Colorado. It’s a must. If you drill you will clean up and insure safety. They can not leave evidence

4421 2018-07-19 15:09:24 It's the small details that keep a lie alive. There were no planes. But stories like these get into people's heads and keep the official narrative breathing. 

Then you've got their other story, lowkey brainwashing "Bush did it for the oil!"

But no one talks about central banks.

4433 2018-07-19 15:08:44 So Bitcoin is digital gold. And like actual gold, it has interesting properties, but next to no utility relative to an asset like oil. And while scarce, it drowns in a sea of equally scarce clones. So the 'hardness' of its supply is somewhat debatable.

4437 2018-07-19 15:08:13 I immediately regretted coming here for an oil change when I pulled up and that was 40 mins ago. I should have come back later when they had enough people working

4444 2018-07-19 15:07:30 Killing innocents and saying oops later isn't good offense. Its oil robbing and regime changing for your own economic benefit.

-We nuetralized the threat in Afghanistan and are still there.

4450 2018-07-19 15:06:56 hi @mishfong! so sorry, just seeing this - you could sub some neutral oil (like canola) for the applesauce, or half oil and half mashed banana. hope you enjoy!!

4456 2018-07-19 15:06:25 no I did it like 3 years ago don’t get oil changes at the dealership let somebody in the hood do it
4457 2018-07-19 15:06:24 No, it’s what you get when your corrupt government fails to reinvest your nationalized oil profits back into the state.
4458 2018-07-19 15:06:16 To clarify, they get UBI because of all the oil being pumped, so there's tons of excess money. So its an awful comparison when arguing for UBI in somewhere like Chicago.

4492 2018-07-19 15:03:10 If DT looked at me the way he looks at Putin, I'd be embarrassed by his fawning. Germany is allowed to buy oil/gas from anyone.

4506 2018-07-19 15:01:44 Actually not a Bad Idea ...the Methane Gas which comes out from Dung can run cars ...

Brilliant Idea @sambitswaraj let us start venture in Cow Dung to Methane Gas production plant so no need to import crude oil

4509 2018-07-19 15:01:04 Not even after the spills, the increase and harm comes with business as usual, because that oil is going to be burned, not turned into plastics or something that might provide a net good during its lifespan.

4512 2018-07-19 15:00:58 That isn't how the #ICJ interpreted the "essential security interests" provision in Oil Platforms, and it won't do so here. But whether a measure is "necessary" to protect essential security interests is also "not purely a question for the subjective judgment of the party".

4515 2018-07-19 15:00:48 Es razonable, deben renunciar. Podrida también estaba la presidencia con PPK al frente, por sus negociados con Odebrecht (se olvidaron de Hunt Oil?), y renunció. Lastima que no sacaron audios de Toledo, Humala, Nadine y Villarán, porque también hubiesen tenido que renunciar.

4517 2018-07-19 15:00:44 Andy come lately yet again. Jim Car has spent the last 32 months as Resources Minister promoting the need to diversify oil and other resources exports to overseas markets. Wake up Andrew, and stop pandering. Our Party needs leadership not petty BS
4518 2018-07-19 15:00:41 This morning's spike was led by headlines from Saudi OPEC Governor that they wont pump more oil than demand requires.

4519 2018-07-19 15:00:36 The issue is that they tied too much of their economy into oil prices, which then had too much volatility when the market plunged and cost per barrel when down (thanks to Obama, I might add). Not recognizing the volatility and saving money exasperated the dictatorial problem.

4538 2018-07-19 14:58:57 This is the moisture content of the rapeseed. Needs to be under 9% to store safely but over 6% to be able to extract oil  effectively. With the hot dry weather many are having to stop harvesting as it's too dry, unusual in this country!

4545 2018-07-19 14:57:13 China and oil just beat Japan's currency crush.  This is 3D chess now.  Importers of raw goods do not fare well when crushing their currency. Especially if your end customer will raise tariffs to block that advantage.  China plays Go, The U.S. plays Stop.
4546 2018-07-19 14:57:11 The government out money to people in exchange for their political support isn't capitalism, even if that money comes from oil revenue. How can you not understand this?

4570 2018-07-19 14:55:18 I agree with you 100%. Problem in my two ridings (home, work) is that NDP supporters show nice colourful graphs why tax boosts economy. To trades & oil workers unemployed for past year, those graphs mean bollocks. UCP exploits that. We need a viable middle ground party in Alberta

4582 2018-07-19 14:53:36 The rising US$ falling commodity prices narrative is now in full effect. Copper down. Oil down. Gold down. Dollar up and continuing to go up as interest rates track up. It’s not a neat straight line but market finds a way over time to get there.

Its a green bottle. Made by Dabur.
4586 2018-07-19 14:53:15 I didn't know that and really don't give a rat's ass about Texas or oil. We need clean energy, not dirty stinking oil produced by dirty stinking companies. Saluting a dictator's soldier is far worse than anything. Obama NEVER attend Farrakhan rallies, so stop making shit up.
4587 2018-07-19 14:53:09 I'm sure glad you like losing then. Keep in mind that all of the ports, agriculture, oil and water are nestled snugly in RED controlled counties...oh and they also have all the guns.
4588 2018-07-19 14:52:56 And even that assumption that 'standardised' cannabis products will be moved to schedule 2 may not survive the MHRA/DHSC definition of what a 'cannabis-derived medicinal product' is. See, for example, MHRA refusal to recognise standardised CBD oil as a medicine.

4597 2018-07-19 14:51:41 Is the article valid? I mean 2Y old article!!!. I've been following keto diet. This article says avoid oil in general. Good saturated fat is good for health. Cooking and consuming  coconut oil, olive oil is good for health. High fat low carbs leads to better lifestyle
4598 2018-07-19 14:51:37 A woman dressed in short-shorts, bikini top, and bunny ears vandalized our dealership yesterday. She drenched 5 cars in oil, wrote cryptic messages in oil, and also bathed in the oil. She also lit a small fire.

You should not be washing your hair every day! “But Samie my hair gets so oily.” By washing your hair everyday you’re over stimulating your oil glands and drying them out causing them to over produce. *Your hair needs natural oils to grow*

4624 2018-07-19 14:49:23 LMAO!! Yes. it has a certain ambiguity unless you are privy! It was very much a platform that had been submerged in snake oil, e.g., look how that frumpy fraud HoHo has gravitated to the pit in which she belongs...

4638 2018-07-19 14:48:43 Many views on the subject, but the fact of the matter is we're better-off talking & negotiating w/ Putin, (ie, keeping an adversary, nuclear power, & energy competitor among us than against us. Note, Russian/German Oil & Gas Pipeline is major threat to US economy & western world
4639 2018-07-19 14:48:37 I like your quote about there not being space but why push the myth about bike helmets? Helmets are promoted by oil giants to keep people from riding because they don't want to wear one. If cyclists need helmets so do scooter riders and drivers. 1/2 of head injuries occur in cars

4642 2018-07-19 14:48:03 Every time I come to get my oil changed, these dudes always find something else wrong 
4643 2018-07-19 14:47:56 It was the tea tree oil that made me try it! I never thought about pure tea tree oil actually. Thanks 
4644 2018-07-19 14:47:51 That moment I wasn’t expecting them to open my trunk to do an oil change only to come to my tail light is out. They had to open my trunk to see my big box of alcohol from this past weekend. #ilooklikeanalcoholic
4645 2018-07-19 14:47:47 Also, clearly my point is, we wouldn’t have the carbon tax implemented on us if he just left things alone. Nothing to do with banning fuel or the production of oil.
4646 2018-07-19 14:47:44 ここはね笑うとこだよー
4647 2018-07-19 14:47:32 I hate Islamist fanatics. But US and UK did the biggest massacre in modern history by invading three anti-jihadi muslim countries of Iraq, Syria and Libya for oil (and golan heights), all the while partying with Saudi Salafi Jihadi regime, whom they use as useful idiots for oil.

4656 2018-07-19 14:46:58 E4L, you forgot the most important parts of the plan . . . expel Russians diplomats by the score, close Russian embassies, increase financial sanctions against Russia, scold NATO countries for buying Russian oil and send missiles to Syria (TWICE)!!! 
4657 2018-07-19 14:46:49 If your face is oily don't load it up with pressed powder which will block your pores and produce oil and acne! Soak up oil with tissue.

You want to work with Russia on cyber attacks? That’s idiotic at best.

4709 2018-07-19 14:42:11 If it’s “crying” olive oil that means someone is putting olive oil in it. Even if they can’t “explain” it doesn’t mean it’s not being rigged. Olive oil doesn’t materialize out of thin air. Sorry, not sorry.

4791 2018-07-19 14:34:23 Germany is involved in building a PIPELINE— when it is finished the majority of their oil will be coming from Russia. Trump is trying to stop it and wants Germany and EU to biy oil from the US.

4793 2018-07-19 14:34:16 In next downturn, either Fed will have to monetize USTs/entitlements/US DoD or the US will nominally default on one or all 3 of those line items.  Gold unlikely to do poorly in such an environment, esp for a major oil exporter who can dictate gold's price whenever they see fit.

4820 2018-07-19 14:31:10 It’s important to remember that oil is a resource we primarily import from overseas. If you’d rather support American workers and industries, using a natural gas HVAC system can help you do it.

4829 2018-07-19 14:30:08 Page 1 of the report it implies investment for these jobs is annually..meaning that most of this money would go to employees, not to build anything "sustainable". If the "investment" stops so do the jobs with nothing to show. (Not in favour of subsidies to Oil & Gas either BTW).
4830 2018-07-19 14:30:01 Putin will make a move to take control of the Middle East . That has been his goal to cut off  Europe from oil control the Suez Canal . Trump is a completely incompetent fool that has no idea how ruthless Putin is . NATO needs to be strong not torn apart by this MORON !
4831 2018-07-19 14:30:01 It’s not about the oil (although revenues have risen consistently for the last 5 years, with new fields discovered). I’d rather we pursued renewable options.

4842 2018-07-19 14:28:46 Any idea why India imports so much petcoke? As it is, the crude oil consumption in India has gone up exponentially and you would expect refineries to produce more petcoke?  From the graph, the domestic production is nearly constant and the demand is being met by more import.

Eh, I’m no expert on these things but it sounds very much like a miracle, no?
4854 2018-07-19 14:28:03 It was because Assad thought it had a bigger problem with jihadists (and he was right) and wanted to act coordinated with YPG against them. Then the US gave up with jihadists and invest in YPG. Now YPG fighting against Assad around oil fields...
4855 2018-07-19 14:27:48 Trump is no patriot and selling out America to putin. U are late, we already knew this about the snake oil salesman but u ppl were buying the snake oil and drinking the kool-aid. #CULT45 led by #DonTheCon
4856 2018-07-19 14:27:35 Get over it. Trump is much tougher on Russia than feckless Obama. He has put sanctions on, opened US oil production which cripples Russia, armed Ukraine. Pretty tough. Obama had a plastic reset button. Pathetic. “Tell Vlad I’ll have more flexibility after the election.”
4857 2018-07-19 14:27:34 With demand topping 100m barrels per day next year, natural depletion of reservoirs, major under investment for the 14-16 period, very low spare capacity this may end up in a scenario of a total bidding war for oil available for export.

4862 2018-07-19 14:27:23 I wonder if carbon emissions would still be a problem if the gas, coal, and oil industries were owned by corporations who favored Democrats? Somewhere in the answer to that question lies understanding.
4863 2018-07-19 14:27:22 Of course, Norway doesn't have a large military force that patrols the world in peace; gives countries billions for assistance and stabilization and Norway is powered by North Sea oil.  I guess socialist don't care about oil unless it is the US producing it.

4874 2018-07-19 14:26:48 It’s not about the oil. It’s about self determination. Scotland is a very resourceful country.
4875 2018-07-19 14:26:46 Of course!  Tillerson’s stock and connections to oil leases in Russia are the reason.  It was clearly pointed out at the time of his nomination as Secretary of State.  Truth struggles against the gaggle of the incompetent.

4877 2018-07-19 14:26:39 Interesting. I did not inherit my used car bias and came to it after not driving for 6 years in NYC. I simply could not stomach a purchase that would instantly drop 10%-20% in value. 9 years later, my Accord has needed nothing but oil changes and new tires.

4887 2018-07-19 14:25:45 That's the shadow government.  Deep state, government which doesn't change politically, works for them.  Great early example of the whole mess working together is the UK-US MI6-CIA Anglo-Persian (later BP) Oil coup in Iran in 1953.

4890 2018-07-19 14:25:26 I think this is not true, as we are waiting for tankers to load OR ship oil from Ras lanuf's storage tanks in order to have space  there to be able to start pumping from  Nafora, Amal  and wintershall oil fields. Then we can start production operations and pump again Ras lanuf.

4906 2018-07-19 14:24:31 From Seeking Alpha - According to HSBC, The Permian Basin and Eagle Ford oilfields are expected to produce 5.6M barrels per day by 2019, topping the 4.8M bpd of Iraq and 3M bpd of Iran. That would make Texas the world's No. 3 oil producer, behind only Russia and Saudi Arabia.

4922 2018-07-19 14:23:28 Thanks! It confirms that the US will flood the market with LTO (useless for distillates) and whose worldwide demand is only around 17 million bar./day while heavy oil with be more and more scarced. Cushing will be the first proof of this oil market segmentation to come...
4923 2018-07-19 14:23:17 Just another friendly reminder, the American people are sick of your ridiculous snake oil salesman tactics. They’re tired of your endless, devious lies. They’re tired of the endless drama.

4952 2018-07-19 14:20:12 Most German cars like bmw or Benz only require an oil change either once a year or every 12000 miles. I’m pretty sure it would be the same with the Bugatti
4953 2018-07-19 14:20:06 Can't you guys seriously see that Rojava stuff is for securing oil reserves for the US and disconnecting Iran with the Syria and Lebanon, right? You cant seriously support this for leftist/revolutionary motivation?
4954 2018-07-19 14:20:01 Randomly chose a jiffy loob for an oil change and a butch black woman is working and I feel like so lucky I’m gonna have to buy a lottery ticket. Was expecting the usual Trumpster white guy heterosexism. WHEW!
4955 2018-07-19 14:19:52 Omfg this is amazing. If the wall comes w/ a #TrumpBot I predict a landslide in 2020. Also quick question, how does having a violent, cursing, unlawful, and entitled person mocking our laws (and POTUS) get ppl to support their cause? Seems like the wrong way to go about it.

4959 2018-07-19 14:19:34 Oh I saw something on This Morning the other day (It was shared on their fb page) about using oil and water then adding food colouring and a dissolvable aspirin. It makes a lava lamp!!

4963 2018-07-19 14:19:25 Well...With multiple countries having supply issues, global demand growing at 1mbd+ per year, prices still way below the highs of years ago and very low spare capacity one does not need to be an expert that oil will squeeze far higher than most imagine.
4964 2018-07-19 14:19:20 This is the best Science Fiction movie I have seen lately. Trupinator gets 2 thumbs up.
4965 2018-07-19 14:19:19 wow that is definitely the key takeaway CB - in my personal case I 100% inherited the used-car bias from my dad, and still change the oil & swap out brake pads/rotors & thermostats just like he does. 

I feel like Dolores in season 1 of Westworld

4968 2018-07-19 14:18:54 It would make more sense to refine the carbon tax then to eliminate it, the same with cap & trade. Sweeping things under the rug does not resolve any issues. Ford tries to make everything about money. He is a snake oil salesman. Talk to people who grew up with the Fords.

4974 2018-07-19 14:18:05 Rebates are ok when transparency and choice available to *all* stakeholders. Rebates become about monopoly profits when parties obscure details. That tactic is right out of standard oil + railroad playbook for how to be anti-competitive.

4987 2018-07-19 14:17:09 @RodPhillips01 Its unfortunate that you won't be around to explain to your grandchildren or great grandchildren how you favoured oil and gas over safer sustainable energy. When their lakes and rivers are polluted and climate change effects them daily. You are a Ford puppet.
4988 2018-07-19 14:17:07 I don’t trust doctors. If I feel unwell, I just go for an alkaline diet, and put some milk and honey essential oil in my diffuser.

4991 2018-07-19 14:16:56 The stream of your tears would never be allowed to reach The presidency. We need a subtle revolution like citizens uprising to shut down the government for months. That way they would feel the pinch when money to steal stops coming in. Niger Delta oil needs to stop flowing now!

4993 2018-07-19 14:16:51 We’ve had the #1 economy in the world for decades. Deregulation allows for further multinational acquisition of American resources. Our enormous military largely defends assets of oil co.s and we remain prostrate to opec nations that fund radicals with our energy $s.
4994 2018-07-19 14:16:48 I’d agree with you there, although I’m not sure you can claim the high road while championing big oil.
Anyway, have a good day man ttyl.

5001 2018-07-19 14:15:56 Why would he want NATO to spend more on defense? Why would he not want Germany to buy oil from Russia ? Why would he close Russian embassies? Why would he fire and kill Russians in Syria? What you are saying doesn't make sense.

5019 2018-07-19 14:14:44 Whilst sustainable palm oil does bring many benefits, including the protection of primary forest and local communities, we recognise that the implementation of RSPO certification standards remains a challenge and efforts need to be continually improved to further the fight 1/2

5023 2018-07-19 14:14:17 This is completely true. Oil is barely at a level where it is worth for the majors to invest in new production. Talk about a wrong way to manage a problem. The truth is that Trump does not want high gasoline prices before the mid-term elections.
5024 2018-07-19 14:14:16 no, they don't. at least not the ones running the oil ministry.

5035 2018-07-19 14:13:33 Things Putin hates:

2. Increased Defense spending
3. Increased NATO spending

5. Calling out Nordstream 2
6. Killing Russians in Syria
7. Strong US economy

Things Putin loves:

5041 2018-07-19 14:12:35 Salad is just an olive oil delivery system.
5042 2018-07-19 14:12:32 That's why he told Merkel to not by oil from Russia. Why he reduced your taxes,  getting everyone jobs, wants our borders secure, getting corrupt high-ranking officials fired and prosecuted, getting prisoners sent home... and on and on.

5053 2018-07-19 14:11:27 I mean the man killed Russians in Syria. He is trying to make NATO pony up more money for defense. He closed embassies. He increased sanctions on Russia. He tried to talk Germany into not buying oil from Russia. Doesn't sound like be is in bed with them to me.

5061 2018-07-19 14:10:29 I think it was actually boiling oil instead of water. Either way it's insanely retarded.
5062 2018-07-19 14:10:25 It's not olive oil. It is some oil and it smells like roses. Not everyone is meant to believe. This has been happening all over the world, more and more frequently.

No doubt they will struggle, maybe they will be finished.
I don't know how that would help anyone who holds western values.
Russia might take Montenegro, then Finland, and Norway for its oil, what next.
But britain will be britain. lol

5094 2018-07-19 14:06:38 A bit lite on substance and fairness here.  Palm oil trees need to be planted only once every 25 years of production whereas all other oilseed crop are 90 day cycles!
5095 2018-07-19 14:06:25 You’d think they’d only take that drastic a measure when oil was in the triple digits. I’m amazed at all the hoopla with oil only in the 60’s and 70’s. They’re going to shoot their ammo before the real oil crisis starts.
5096 2018-07-19 14:06:16 E15 isn't good for farmers or the economy.
It's a corporate welfare scam that costs everyday Americans billions is gasoline engine damage and added auto prices.

Another example of a govt program, meant to reduce foreign oil dependence, turning into a never ending slush fund.

5114 2018-07-19 14:03:50 @Atomicrod  The very name "ATF" has a poor connotation for nuclear fuel. Not surprisingly LNG doesn't have an accident tolerant fuel -nor wind, solar, oil. Revoking/renaming nuclear fuel to NextGen or FuturFuel would go a long way. HOW could this simple rebranding take place??

5200 2018-07-19 13:54:21 Right, I wonder how many barriers there would be, but also what cultural biases happen. Does everyone start out as fishers? Do more remote oil fields create new power dynamics?
5201 2018-07-19 13:54:17 Yup, I try to limit my carbon footprint. But it’s not a matter of cutting out all oil products, it’s a matter reducing our burning of hydrocarbons and carbon emissions. Canada doesn’t need to emit 3 times the world average per capita.

5234 2018-07-19 13:50:50 Yea...I was really skeptical because about six years ago I tried a CBD oil cream and got a very bad allergic reaction, but I was hoping this time would be different. Back to finding a seizure medicine which is always fun and impossible!

To say otherwise would be stubborn denial.

5269 2018-07-19 13:47:30 IMHO none of this matters if you’re long.  It’s a shell game.  Oil moves from one storage facility to another.  Prices swing.  It changes nothing.  We’re still in structural supply deficit... And the tide is going out.  Who’s naked?

5295 2018-07-19 13:45:15 According to the USEPA, almost 300 million gallons of used oil are improperly disposed of each year. When this occurs, not only do we lose the value of this scarce resource, but the contaminants in the used oil can harm our environment.
5296 2018-07-19 13:45:12 2014 - Crude Oil Price -$100
            Exchange Rate -$1=N165
1,000,000 Barrels x 100 x 165 =16,500,000,000

2018 - Crude Oil Price -$70

5306 2018-07-19 13:44:35 Can't help but laugh at how the media changes tune so quickly depending on daily price moves. One day we have an oil shortage and $100 incoming, the next we are oversupplied again and demand is slipping...

5348 2018-07-19 13:39:25 Are we not deviating from the real picture? The real reson behind Tullow closing down the water wells is because residents are realising their rights to security and fighting for them to the point where they blocked crude oil from being shipped out.

5389 2018-07-19 13:35:12 We pay for it. Ask your Arab daddies to stop supplying oil to India. BTW your UAE daddies are demanding Brahmos technology from India.

5391 2018-07-19 13:34:41 So why didn't they dig the wells themselves? The maji (& oil) has been there for millennia/eons. Way before the Portuguese showed up in Mombasa. Heck, let's just go back a few decades. Walikosa jembe?

5413 2018-07-19 13:32:00 That’s possible. It really comes down to a mathematical exercise and assumptions they used. Gas should have a higher recoverable than oil in tighter rock, all thinks equal. Lifting liquids in years 5+ gets tough and will affect their end of life cutoffs

5448 2018-07-19 13:29:18 Obama all he could he could to shutter Canada's oil and gas industry. He simultaneously built  over 10,000 miles of pipeline, expanded USA LNG industry, ramped up US oil exports offshore and quadrupled US Methane flaring.  He did manage to hoodwink Trudeau, yes, he did that.
5449 2018-07-19 13:29:06 But replacing fossile fueled cars with electric ones when you’re producing electricity by burning coal, oil and gas - that is just plain insanity, isn’t it? It is just an excuse to get more fiscal taxes. Nuclear fusion is the future.

5502 2018-07-19 13:24:33 Showers and baths add moisture to your skin, but they can also dry it out by removing the skin's natural oils. Hot water washes away oil faster than warm water. So use warm water when you cleanse your face and limit yourself to one short (five minutes) warm shower or bath a day.

5607 2018-07-19 13:16:26 With all the chaos in the Middle East extracting Somali oil should be a global priority to bypass Iranian threats of closing Straits of Hormuz. Expect to see increasing global interest in Somalia & HOA region in general. US/Turkey/EU/Qatar are the major players in Somalia.
5608 2018-07-19 13:16:20 Must be virgin olive oil. Or maybe even extra virgin
5609 2018-07-19 13:16:16 It killed investment in start-up oil companies, not to forget screwing people who held these trusts out of millions, if not billions, of dollars.
5610 2018-07-19 13:16:00 Without the USA where & what would they do, rely on Russia for oil and China for goods hmm
5611 2018-07-19 13:16:00 Yeah right..I'll bet the hydrologist and geologist are people hired directly by MVP and not by the state of Virginia.
And..I'd bet they'll clear MVP to continue work...just watch!
Tired of the oil/gas companies pulling sneaky shit! We need unbiased analysis.

She simply shouts that the leader of the LP who has fought all forms of racism all through his political life is a "fucking" racist and antisemite. Go on, I dare you to repeat those claims if there's no problem with them. Be a man not a snake.
5641 2018-07-19 13:12:45 By 2019 Texas will be producing roughly 5.6M barrels of oil PER DAY. Making it the 3rd largest oil producer, behind Russia and Saudi Arabia.

5658 2018-07-19 13:10:20 You are most certainly not supposed to add olive oil to any boiling pasta. Just salt, then stir it from time to time. If a real italian catches you puthing olive oil in they'll smack you back to 18th century italy

5678 2018-07-19 13:08:00 5) How will people know what/how much to make?

5679 2018-07-19 13:07:59 So, if a priest/nun rides in my car and the very next day starts leaking motor oil, does that make it sacred? Asking for someone else...
5680 2018-07-19 13:07:58 Now we need to see also the big fish being fried in the oil especially those who were behind of the killing of Kenyans patriotic people.
5681 2018-07-19 13:07:43 You think dry shampoo is a sham (it absorbs excess oil giving new life to hair) but use Lysol to clean your hands?  Listen to @MissShinkle & @jendalton12 they know what they’re talking about.

5726 2018-07-19 13:02:44 Showers and baths add moisture to your skin, but they can also dry it out by removing the skin's natural oils. Hot water washes away oil faster than warm water.

5738 2018-07-19 13:01:20 Carrot seed oil. Jamaican black castor oil, I like the one with peppermint. Spirulina  and omega-3 supplements help. Also always keep it moisturised to help with length retention and prevent it from breaking.

5749 2018-07-19 12:59:50 Wait what's with the olive oil? I know I could Google it but this seems like more fun.
5750 2018-07-19 12:59:42 I think we are seeing a lot more in the 'big pool', unfortunately lots of snake oil at the moment but as you say, maybe in 10 years time...

5752 2018-07-19 12:59:38 Or maybe we could be saying that had we listened to Pierre Elliot we would have a program that would have Canadians treated like consumers of oil as well as producers. We would likely have pipelines to both coasts and wouldn’t be robbed at the pumps. We could call it a NEP

5756 2018-07-19 12:59:13 Nah we're good, just turn off CNN and you will start to feel better. Btw you sound a bit like all the doomsday soothsayers 40 years ago who thought that overpopulation would kill us or that oil would run out etc...perhaps a little perspective is all you need?

5772 2018-07-19 12:56:54 What do they mean by 'oil production'? It's not oil use by definition, it's the process of getting it out of the ground. Looking at it that way, it's energy efficient to drill and then extract the oil, and transport it. If it weren't they wouldn't bother. #nomoneyinit #getagrip
5773 2018-07-19 12:56:50 Now management sends a crew to clean the floors every morning. All because they don’t want to take the time to fix the problems that are leading to oil leaking on the floor.

5823 2018-07-19 12:51:22 It’s not socialism that’s the problem in Venezuela. It’s the fact that oil is 95% of the countries export, and crude oil prices fluctuates.  These top socialist countries aren’t complaining.         Denmark

5866 2018-07-19 12:46:50 Jus met my neighbour
His daughter was diagnosed with inoperable brain cancer
So he's been microdosing her with cannabis oil
I've just seen the original scan and the latest brain scan
No tumour
She's in her 20's and has a wee baby
Hurrah

5870 2018-07-19 12:46:19 If you can't see that Trump is currently selling out US interests to anyone who will pay him then you aren't as smart as you think you are. Trump is a 2nd rate car salesman, a snake oil con man.

5881 2018-07-19 12:45:01 Yeah, my mum is half West Indian too, but hers is almost definitely dragondom or virgin sacrifice rather than coconut oil. However, I’m going to buy some coconut oil!

5907 2018-07-19 12:42:19 #TIL Texas is expected to produce 5.6M barrels of oil per day by 2019, topping the 4.8M bpd output of #Iraq and 3M bpd of #Iran . That would make #Texas the world's No.3 oil producer, behind only #Russia and #SaudiArabia . Just wondering what happens to the money made by Iraq!
5908 2018-07-19 12:42:10 Costco launches grocery delivery in Canada. Good news for people who can't fit a barrel of olive oil on their bike.
5909 2018-07-19 12:41:37 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Raleigh sleeps.
5910 2018-07-19 12:41:36 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Oakland sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
5911 2018-07-19 12:41:32 Still no crane in site says no  striping taking place. If it's free flowing like it was alluded to in the last RNS mind boggles what number of Barrels of Oil a day it could be producing.

5921 2018-07-19 12:40:36 A lot of people in the oil & gas industry set up their own small businesses when they were laid off. As the industry is recovering, a lot of those businesses are closing as staff return to their old jobs. The choice of a regular fixed salary vs a risky small business is now easy.
5922 2018-07-19 12:40:28 And we buy their oil to support this. Unreal.

6137 2018-07-19 12:17:27 Africa has enough talent. But, why  is it that Africa is neck deep in violence, sectarian conflicts, genocide, war over oil, diamonds etc, and could not deliver in world stage ? If French have turned raw talent into winners, they deserve as much credit as the talent itself.
6138 2018-07-19 12:17:22 I know. In the 90s ran a start-up with UK branch. Had diverse base of industrial customers. Maybe not all leading edge, but competent enough. With competitive pricing, they muddled through. A rapacious oil & gas export policy fueled a high GBP, paid for imports, killed industry.

6148 2018-07-19 12:16:37 2/ Total global primary energy consumption 2017 (BP Statistical Survey of World Energy): Oil 4621.9 million tonnes of oil equivalent, Coal 3731.5, Gas 3156, Nuke 596.4, hydro 918.6, other renewables 486.8. So coal is 2nd, total non-carbon = 2001.8.
6149 2018-07-19 12:16:34 To @Barclays @Greenpeace the #tarsands ?

Are you completely oblivious to #climatechange ?

You are removing the forests that remove CO2 rrom the atmosphere, to dig up oil to burn to make more CO2.

Which bit don’t you get ?

6164 2018-07-19 12:15:07 I see pictures of the tar sands and weep at the large scale destruction.  This is what the race for the last of the oil looks like.  Our children will not thank us for it.@Barclays #StopPipelines

6276 2018-07-19 12:03:43 Looking at the article that seems like 7kbbl diesel saved per day. Scaled up to the rest of Chinese public urban transport (*100+), will soon make a difference in oil consumption.
It is (sadly) for now replaced by coal for power (but is more efficient).

6361 2018-07-19 11:54:26 This should be a law. Voting yes on a war declaration or authorizing military action will automatically draft the persons children into the service. This would give them pause before shipping us off to war for oil or other corporate interests.

6369 2018-07-19 11:53:27 Early in the day, but I think today's prize for "oddest therapeutic agent" goes to "Oil of Bricks". 

Honestly struggling to think of anything less oily than a brick. Brick dust in oil perhaps? How does one get oil out of a brick, and is it harder than getting blood from a stone?
6370 2018-07-19 11:53:18 It's just an oil deal. There is so much emotional poo-flinging but it's simple. It's a deal to reduce dependency on M.E. oil, and dial in Russia more. Also they have an agreement to drill the Arctic before China gets in there and takes it all. That's what ALL of this is about.

6392 2018-07-19 11:50:10 Statues don’t weep olive oil. Someone or people are putting there it to make it look a “miracle,” but it’s not. In the past other weeping have been scientifically explained, that is why they are using olive oil instead of water, little harder to explain.

6418 2018-07-19 11:47:51 Good job virtue signalling your plastic straws, but

Straws only account for 0.02% of the plastic in the oceans

6420 2018-07-19 11:47:16 Looks like a foreign HAND is involved in this.  Why only Olive Oil? why not Sunflower Oil or Palm Oil or more specifically the desi  sesame oil, Coconut Oil or Groundnut Oil?  Even in miracles looks like Mary does not care about  the unwashed AAM aadmi.

6425 2018-07-19 11:46:46 Turkey cheated in the past, (ex: #RezaZarrab & #HalkBank cases). Yet, Trump administration might be willing to grant some important waivers to Turkey because 1) Turkey's dependence on Iran's oil and gas has increased 2) Relations between Ankara-Washington have already been tense.

6431 2018-07-19 11:46:07 this mini one turbocharger was sent in minus the turbine manifold.on inspection, the bearings were scored meaning dirty oil was circulating the engine and turbo.a new core assembly was fitted and given a 2 year warranty.

6455 2018-07-19 11:42:02 Sometimes some dipshit foreign catfisher follows me. They hijack a handsome dude's pic, say they're in Syria, an oil rig, or some other far off place. Often they pose as doctors or Special Ops. And then dm "How are you today?" Bad grammer and spelling follow. Creeps.
6456 2018-07-19 11:41:58 I think she sailed to Samaria, got some oil out of Jacob's Well and talked to Jesus. He told her she had 5 husbands, but the guy she was sharing the cabin with on the cruise ship was not her husband. Sounds legit!
6457 2018-07-19 11:41:56 The remedy for a tax is to vote out the tax-implementing party.

6484 2018-07-19 11:38:16 why olive oil - something readily available today?  why not something unusual to lend more credence to the assertions
6485 2018-07-19 11:38:00 I’m pretty sure plants don’t like being cooked in a pan with coconut oil... that’s just me though.  They were just chillin’ making us fresh air and all; then there y’all go killing them and eat’em.  #savages #vegans
6486 2018-07-19 11:37:35 Well, yes...$3 billion of projects planned in Basra in 2011...and oil revenues *went up* even after that. Worrying
6487 2018-07-19 11:37:34 This is such a lie, Donald. NO one wants war.  What we want is a clean green economy, which you and Vladimir are blind to. I am sure a large part of your meeting was to talk about how to rape, pillage and plunge the earth for the last remaining drops of oil and gas.

6550 2018-07-19 11:29:31 IMF cuts India’s growth projection: IMC agrees to  IMFs downward  projections  for 2018, 2019 due to high oil prices, faster than expected tightening of monetary policy on fears of higher inflation. Lower growth rates in Euro Zone, Japan and UK are due to this reason.

6560 2018-07-19 11:28:05 I saw it and totally believe it. I actually thought the same thing a while ago. Partly because I think part of Putin’s plan is oil and so I thought he handpicked an oil guy by putting Tillerson in

6600 2018-07-19 11:21:36 They're obviously not aware of Shetlands £252million oil trust fund, which is growing by the day. Shetland will only get richer now. 
I don't understand why @scotgoveconomy didn't copy their model. We don't need independence to be negotiating regional oil trust funds.
6601 2018-07-19 11:21:33 The nordic countries arnt even considered socialist.  They are predominantly white, made money selling oil, and have some nationalized social programs.  By that criteria, progressives should also love Russia.

6685 2018-07-19 11:08:12 They have been using oil price as their campaign all these years (too high) so forgive me if I expect more from them. My bar is quite high, remember this is not a BN govt, this is supposed to be well prepared govt. At this rate lagi 5 tahun will be close to 17k lah if its true
6686 2018-07-19 11:07:35 It's a failed state and we about to fuel it with the turkana oil

6692 2018-07-19 11:07:01 I thought investors were pouring money into US shale production. Is that no longer true?
6693 2018-07-19 11:06:55 Yes it happens. While pregnant hair stops falling out and then post partum hair starts to fall out again  I guess it’s like your body getting back to the way it was. I know taking prenatal vitamins helped me a lot and fish oil and biotin

6699 2018-07-19 11:04:52 So I bought my car a little over a year ago and around the same time my job gave me a car so I haven’t used my car as much. I haven’t got a oil change yet since I haven’t got to 3k miles. Should I take it in still? via /r/car No text found
6700 2018-07-19 11:04:50 They don't give the dosage of fish oil they tested, and as I understand it, that is critical. I know from experience it's true that biotin at lower dosages does not give new hair growth, but at 10,000 units daily it does, and that's what oncologists recommend to those on chemo.
6701 2018-07-19 11:04:44 This is how extra virgin olive oil is made.

Seriously though, someone is sneaking in and putting the oil on the statue. There is no mystery here. Set up cameras, you’ll soon have your answer.

6703 2018-07-19 11:04:33 Angolan production growth q3 should take some of the pressure off, but we will see. US situation is becoming stranger with tight middle distilate and fuel oil stocks due to shales impact on refinery yield. Think in reality they are tighter than mere top numbers suggest
6704 2018-07-19 11:04:14 Yes, yes let’s worry about uranium when we are raping our national parks, defunded VA benefits, removing protections for men and women on the deep water oil rigs, taking away the incentives for clean air and water, keeping children from their parents at the border...yes, let’s

6722 2018-07-19 11:01:02 Oh, and he is urging Germany to stop buying oil from Russia and buy from us instead, which would DESTROY Russia and Putin. Did BO suggest that? Frankly, the evidence ckearly points to Obama being Putin's great appeaser. Looks like he took Hillary's "Russian Reset" very seriously.

6732 2018-07-19 11:00:22 However , high oil production triggered high depletion rates, which soared from 30% three years ago to 79% currently in the Permian. The soaring depletion is highly disruptive for the bond market and shale companies, which have taken more that they can swallow.
6733 2018-07-19 11:00:21 マジ？
6734 2018-07-19 11:00:13 Firstly you have to transport oil both to refineries and then huge deisel trucks have to carry it daily to forecourts. Electrical power goes direct almost instantly from where it is made and into car. Point 1!
6735 2018-07-19 11:00:13 I don’t know where you’re getting your extra virgin olive oil because Costco sells it cheap

6958 2018-07-19 10:31:07 Hence the essential oil modification
6959 2018-07-19 10:31:02 Anyone know anything about nrf2 activation & reducing oxidative stress to help MS? I'm being told someone's client reduced lesions by doing whatever this is... (waiting for more details) snake oil? @MSCureFund @shiftms @MSUK6 @mssocietyuk @mssociety @MSTrust @msresearch

6961 2018-07-19 10:30:50 My face can provide oil for this entire country
6962 2018-07-19 10:30:48 Always playing the victim and the blame game, it’s hip and kl to respect all faiths and religions, whiles your happy using Muslim oil think about how our cultural need for oil is oppressing the same women kids and men you claim Islam does, your a fascist and a hypocrite
6963 2018-07-19 10:30:36 Ceasing oil sales isn't nearly as offensive as imposing sanctions on noon compliant states. it's not very nice, but it's heardly tantamount to invading. Or staging a coup.
6964 2018-07-19 10:30:15 I cook in olive oil and coconut oil, depending on what it is I’m cooking. I also cook in grass fed butter, not everyone in the #paleodiet community agrees with me on that, but many do.

Imo The DOR RNS on the asx market will drop and will be regarding Oil and test at #Horsehill. That all. Same as UKOG had yesterday.Dont panic Mr Mannering :) The rest is BS
6970 2018-07-19 10:29:07 Okay, but it depends on the context.  Russia has a right to choose to sell oil to whomever it wants, as does any nation Just as Poland or Latvia can choose to buy oil from the US or Saudi Arabia or start Fracking. (which the US Department of State has heavily promoted).

6972 2018-07-19 10:28:53 NK an Iran is NOT in place. I dont know where you get your news from but here in Europe we have news sources that reports without political bias. NK is increasing its nuclear programme and Iran makes oil deals with other countries to avoid being affected by US sanctions.

6974 2018-07-19 10:28:26 The US had declared before then that it had a strategic interesting the Persian Gulf and would not tolerate any threat to the flow of oil, but Amb. Glaspie refused to back that up in a meeting with Saddam Hussein, and so he saw that as US weakness and decided to invade Kuwait.

6977 2018-07-19 10:27:44 I ride a old soviet bike. No need for regular check up. Slap some oil from time to time and check tire pressure. Only problem is crankset with wedges, but for that i carry a hammer and wrench set in back pack.

Vote carefully. Old and poor need care. We need infrastructure and no Racism.
6981 2018-07-19 10:27:19 There's no part of my body off limits to coconut oil!!  I would explain further but this is a public forum!
6982 2018-07-19 10:27:10 Sorry naman. Pasensya na po at tamad ako at di makakain ng may olive oil. Edible oil sa supot lang kasi afford ko. Sige po at magluluto lang po ako ng highland legumes with anchovies  and shrimp paste sauteed in garlic and sibuyas Adios.
6983 2018-07-19 10:27:04 Oil, gas, whisky & gin? I can’t think of anything services-wise (finance, tech brainpower, etc.) that aren’t already positioning themselves to be delivered from elsewhere.

6985 2018-07-19 10:26:35 @Barclays have been ignoring the voices of people resisting the damage their funding decisions are doing to people’s communities.

7002 2018-07-19 10:23:20 Before you defend the CIA, I suggest you read up on Project MK Ultra, and also the botched illegal covert op signed off by Obama in 2011 with Saudi, to overthrow the democratically elected gov in Syria (causing ISIS) because Assad refused to give them control of oil pipelines.

7009 2018-07-19 10:21:14 "We need to diversify our economy away from oil" is like saying "we need to fight the roots of poverty," "we need to tackle the causes of terrorism..." That's great, but the gap between the statement and a detailed, actionable plan and political will to do it is a yawning chasm

7031 2018-07-19 10:17:00 This calls for me to make some epic gesture. Like throw pebbles at your glass. You, eschewing self-preservation, check who it is, jug of hot oil at the ready.

- Limit fracking
- Block oil & gas pipelines
- Cut US Military Spending
- Reduce Tensions with Iran

2.  President Barack OBAMA

7054 2018-07-19 10:12:52 Oil. No seriously. The oil must flow and be kept at a reasonable price and all countries must use the hegemonic United States almighty Petro Dollar. Just look what happened to Libya when they tried to use something else....

7060 2018-07-19 10:11:10 2/2. Will that not force down Mr 'Y' to bring down his rate knowing fully well that they both buy their tyres, engine oil, petrol & or diesel from the same market? Does this means folding down the business? Is it not one of the benefits of having a robust & very good competition?
7061 2018-07-19 10:10:58 The epicentre of petro-corruption is the state oil company—the Nigerian

7075 2018-07-19 10:09:08 The difference is, now we don’t have to sell players to balance the books, extra revenue sees to that. City don’t have to do that because they’ve got an oil sugar daddy. That’s the truth.
7076 2018-07-19 10:08:56 Well done Rach. Wipes are also bad for your skin apparently because they just smear the dirt around! I converted to coconut oil and a hot flannel a while ago and have never looked back. Hopefully the body shop's next step will to be to get rid of all that plastic packaging.

7085 2018-07-19 10:08:11 Injustice to one is injustice to all am insupport of the Ogboni people not to allow any further oil drilling in their land until their problems is solve or attended. #environmentreport
7086 2018-07-19 10:07:54 My guess is oil. Putin deals in oil. Trump agrees 2 lift sanctions & installs Tillerson as SoS. Tillerson w/Exxon had been brokering a 500B deal with Putin 2 drill in the Artic & Gulf of Mexico. Sanctions prohibited the deal from moving forward. Trump gets prez & cut of oil deal.
7087 2018-07-19 10:07:41 People: Wow I care so much about the environment. Ban plastic! Buy electric cars! Save the turtles and the forest!!

Me: The biggest impact you can have on the environment is to go vegan and stop eating palm oil!

People: Omg stop shoving your beliefs down our throats crazy hippy
7088 2018-07-19 10:07:28 I wouldn't waste your time with this Manc moron... they will never be a big club and when the oil runs out they will be screwed.
7089 2018-07-19 10:07:22 Trump does not defend Montenegro (NATO member) in case of a war. He says the country is too small. 
I think the real reason is: they don't have oil!!!

7094 2018-07-19 10:06:55 We don't have a healthcare insurance system, but a healthcare financing system. Insurance is just a small part. Imagine how much car insurance would be if it had to cover gas, oil changes and routine maintenance. That's a lot of the administrative costs along w/regulatory burden.

In a classic case of The Streisand Effect it then became apparent about his lobbying on behalf of Sri Lanka and email offering to help assist an oil deal.

7233 2018-07-19 09:42:47 With D clear and legible handwriting on d walls of the oil-dependent economies, PMB is still bent on wasting enormous resources on oil exploration in the North, with the hope of discovering crude oil. WHY NOT SPEND SAME ON OTHER SECTORS?

7245 2018-07-19 09:41:14 It is to allow a comparison to be made between land GDP and GDP when oil is included. 

It is a hint to it's volatility - very unwise for a state to rely structurally on its income to fund services (schools, nhs, defense etc).

See Venezuela for instance.
7246 2018-07-19 09:41:10 This is usually wheat flour, palm oil, and cheese.

Since after the 2015 elections,I can't recall seeing PMB/Tambuwwal together. PMB is yet to be invited to commission any project in Sokoto.

They are oil and water;can't mix.

Does he think business as usual, with declining oil production, rising population, loss making SOEs was great alternative? Probably still has a Che poster above his bed...
7283 2018-07-19 09:36:31 Good eye, @jendalton12, and the recipes look good. My wife will “stir fry” collards in a little oil with red pepper flake sometimes.  I like it, but it’s not as tender as the more traditional recipes.

7808 2018-07-19 08:13:43 Would you say that the spike in the oil price (from $48 to $78 in last year) is a reflection of global growth, or rather due to fears over supply side shortages ie Venezuela, and US sanctions on Iranian oil? I’d suggest more the latter, than the former.

7823 2018-07-19 08:11:05 Yes, weak sterling (in part due to uncertainty over Brexit) has led to import inflation, but, joking apart, it is good of you to acknowledge that other factors are at play, such as the spike in the oil price, from $48 to $78 in the space of 12 months.

7842 2018-07-19 08:06:32 I just can't see how seemingly educated middle class people support labour policies. I also can't see how anyone could think borrowing more money on the behalf of another nation, or stopping local oil exploration has any logic.
7843 2018-07-19 08:06:29 #AAOG : £19m market cap and targeting more than £600m worth of oil. Rest do the maths.

On @maddow now Steele (author of the dossier) told Mueller that the Kremlin blocked Mitt Romney as SOS and we're delighted when Tillerson was chosen. Allegations that other Cabinet members were "picked" as well.
7845 2018-07-19 08:05:50 The ones at Carluccio's were cold raw tomatos on cold toasted bruschetta, but if you lightly fry your tomatoes in a little olive oil first, they are warm.  The juices soak into the bread, its lovely.  Most things seem improved by a tiny bit of olive oil....
7846 2018-07-19 08:05:40 Exactly. More recently Jason Kenney et al fussed because foreign multis left the oil sands thus paving the way for the sands to become more of a consolidated Canadian/regional play.

7855 2018-07-19 08:04:18 yeah the dishwasher safe thing is huge but i remember too the worst was the oil would pop out onto the plastic and then you could never get it all off and it would mix w/ dust and just form this nasty black gunk, also you gotta make deep fried twinkies now its the law

8116 2018-07-19 07:22:12 Petrol prices are nowhere near an all time high mate, pretty sure oil has been lower too.

If we drop the duty on fuel the revenue will need to come from somewhere else or a public service cut. 

It is eye-watering though - can't deny that.

8177 2018-07-19 07:10:12 Did you know in Texas it's legal to coat the flag in oil but not to burn it
8178 2018-07-19 07:10:06 I give great hot oil massages
8179 2018-07-19 07:10:00 potatoes are so good baked in great amounts of oil, salt, and pepper
8180 2018-07-19 07:09:57 Which was a smaller choke than the one used in 2016.
Big choke will obviously mean more oil 
8181 2018-07-19 07:09:50 Mientras tanto, el jefe del National Oil Corporation pide a los habitantes de la zona q ayuden a liberar a los ingenieros secuestrados en Sharara, a la vez q asegura q NO pagarán rescate.

Coconut grows easily in Kerala. Coconut oil will not harm health in Kerala

8186 2018-07-19 07:09:07 The rumours that did the round were the oil companies offered to fund 90% of the costs of this in the 80s but the Labour council refused to fund the other 10%.
Don’t really know if true but I do remember the 10pm curfew set by them at the airport so nothing would surprise me.
8187 2018-07-19 07:08:28 Oil prices at an all time low but diesel and petrol and an all time high, how does that work? Does there no come a point where the Government thinks were ripping the utter pish out folk?
8188 2018-07-19 07:08:19 #DidYouKnow that in "In seventy-five years the human heart pumps 3,122,000,000 gallons of blood, enough to fill in oil tanker over 46 times."

8191 2018-07-19 07:07:30 Didn't know him and PUTIN ordered Trump to take him.  Manafort, Pence, Mnuchin, Ross, Flynn, Bolton, etc., etc.  All PUTIN ordered.  All to lift sanctions to Trillion $ oil fields and so much other corruption.

8196 2018-07-19 07:07:13 depend on them for oil and so we fund their military. Our military industrial complex likes selling to anyone and seems to not much care of the military equipment and weapons it sells get used against us. All they care about, it seems, is $$$.
8197 2018-07-19 07:07:13 Hi,

We don’t own any tankers. We just track them, especially if they contain crude oil.

Thanks

8201 2018-07-19 07:06:41 Today's supermarket additions to the soap making stuff. With bonus image of us learning that the cute little plastic disposable shot glasses we bought back from America are NOT essential oil safe.
8202 2018-07-19 07:06:38 Baby girl! Too cute - even chose somewhere I can climb bike take I even have your sleep essential oil - I remember I promised you one for your birthday

8208 2018-07-19 07:05:34 In my Oil&Gas career I travelled the world business class all the way. Unlike most of my colleagues I saw the reality of the environment. Not just the poverty but the conditions our employees and supply chain lived in. Change the world? You betcha!

8231 2018-07-19 07:01:25 Who is everybody? The industry has seen a lot of consolidation which has driven the recent return to profitability, also aided by low oil prices. You need size to make money, size and being in a favorable location.
8232 2018-07-19 07:01:20 Health tip : If you can , use only natural oil ( Castor,Olive,Coconut,Avocado,Aloe Vera etc ) on your skin and hair

8260 2018-07-19 06:55:33 Lavender candles, oil, and incense for the home is a must during the summer and spring. I can't forget those wax cubes either.

8264 2018-07-19 06:54:57 I read an op-ed on Al Jazeera tonight where the guy was arguing Trump isn't Putin's puppet *solely* because Trump is trying to get EU off Russian oil.

Never addressed the far more weighty issue of Trump choosing Putin over US IC. So fucking infuriating.
8265 2018-07-19 06:54:56 Teringin nak pakai essential oil ni. Tapo Young Living punya mahal nakkkkk.
8266 2018-07-19 06:54:52 My diffuser was the best purchase I’ve made...in a bit. I swear. Every oil smells so dang good too

8268 2018-07-19 06:54:49 They're an oil company, hardly surprising - still slight tinge of greenwash as they're dragged into the future by public demand not personal interest
8269 2018-07-19 06:54:44 Si chaque personne réalise une petite production alimentaire, l'autonomie est énorme.

8270 2018-07-19 06:54:43 Flour/eggs work together to 'hold shape'. Don't need much flour to do it. Also add a couple of spoons of warm oil to the batter too. That helps with the stickiness.

8274 2018-07-19 06:53:48 Hahaha see I still believe we can deal with that bump o! Do a heat compress and use the oil after.
8275 2018-07-19 06:53:40 You are spinning snake oil. People can’t forecast well a few weeks away let alone 30Y. Predictions of the apocalypse don’t match with actual economic results (growing sales tax, nominal gdp). Just dumb. PR had a debt rollover problem not a solvency one. Debt to gdp is low.
8276 2018-07-19 06:53:35 It goes some way to contextualize the antisemitism of the Northeastern elite. Especially Henry Ford the car monopolist got in on that act. Competition for the oil market would hit home.

8307 2018-07-19 06:48:49 The "Hipster antitrust" in corporate America is starting to get a little seem like a product of cynical paranoia.

8309 2018-07-19 06:48:31 For #dry and #dull #skin
Use coconut oil every night before going to bed.  Coconut oil locks the moisture in the skin and also nourishes it with essential fatty acids.

8317 2018-07-19 06:47:31 Saudi Arabia has always been a special case due to oil. We have propped up that government. And have long armed and defended it.  One of their princes, a guy who doesn't like Americans much, indirectly funds Fox News. They funded the schools in Pakistan where the Taliban got

8351 2018-07-19 06:40:30 Also, Trump is not borrowing from any intellectual theory other than that snake-oil-selling business. Are their people who voted for Trump due to the radical left? Probably.  But Trump's approach, style, and philosophy are on opposite ends of the political spectrum.

8359 2018-07-19 06:39:48 You know the markets are bad when the only systematic swings are in crude oil..
8360 2018-07-19 06:39:45 But Putin gain much from high oil price ，he is winner
8361 2018-07-19 06:39:38 Oil? I added some cream onto it so hopefully it’ll help
8362 2018-07-19 06:39:37 Not just the airlines, but carter did oil/gas as well. That enabled oil/gas prices to originally rise, but then fall rather quickly as oil wells were turned up (we had the oil wells already drilled. they were ran slow).
Basically, carter set-up a BOOMING economy to come.
8363 2018-07-19 06:39:15 Read an article somewhere saying the world's most needed resource will be technology,  codes and all. It was talking about why people should shift a little from oil.

Get a grip FFS.

8418 2018-07-19 06:29:58 In my opinion two teaspoons of castor oil would sort the whole lot out!
8419 2018-07-19 06:29:50 There are no free markets.  Trump is currently trying to manipulate oil prices, which will distort prices throughout world economies.  As far as private property and borders, they have probably resulted in more wars and violence than you can imagine!!!
8420 2018-07-19 06:29:48 Unlike global coal price which tends to mimic oil price rise, domestic coal price is regulated.
8421 2018-07-19 06:29:28 Vaseline melts and gums up the receiver. If you use motor oil, use Mobil One Synthetic 0W-10, it can take the heat and won't freeze. You should be able to buy LSA online from a surplus dealer or Army/Navy store.  Less lube is better.
8422 2018-07-19 06:29:17 Saudi Arabia has 265 billion barrels as reserve ; 265 * 80 $ (oil nowadays) = 21200 billion $  = 21.2 trillion  $

8424 2018-07-19 06:29:03 For those wondering why 'olive' oil and not some other oil - Olive oil has got strong 'anti-inflammatory' properties.  That should 'soothe' a lot of nerves - worried about the 'baby sale' and 'nun-to-mother' conversion by 'fathers'.

8582 2018-07-19 06:01:42 Further to your question: why did companies based outside of BC remove refineries from Taylor and Kamloops that refined BC produced oil? What interests were served? Is the refined market more or less competitive than before?

8604 2018-07-19 05:57:53 everybody go and collect 'Extra virgin Olive oil'
8605 2018-07-19 05:57:43 silly to acknowledge their own actions in destroying this planet. Meanwhile, the companies growing/using palm oil are laughing all the way to the bank, buying more rainforest land and planting more palm oil groves :/
8606 2018-07-19 05:57:37 Etymology of 'Virgin olive oil'
8607 2018-07-19 05:57:15 I kept telling people this in my family amd they thought i was just talking. It made my skin burn! I mixed tea tree, coconut oil and and vitamin e oil and it helped me!

8611 2018-07-19 05:56:54 Number one problem with making fried food: splashing hot oil right on ur tit
8612 2018-07-19 05:56:03 CRUDE OIL bounced off 66.50 USD and moved higher again, WTI is now at 67.50 USD per barrel again. 68.00 USD is STRONG level here, the MARKET likes it.
8613 2018-07-19 05:55:55 This was a terrible tragedy  but many Australians never think of many whose children r bombed&maimed by our weapons in wars they Never asked 4, their homes, communities& countries devastated needlessly because USA,UK& allies wanted Cheap oil&control of sales only in Petro$'s?
8614 2018-07-19 05:55:53 I would add that the emissions from the oil displacing Canadian oil, are far, far worse than CDN oil.  Russia has a tremendous amount of spillage, est. at 1% to 4% of their oil production.  This means they spill ~90,000 to 360,000 barrels per DAY.  Per DAY.
8615 2018-07-19 05:55:53 Leviticus 7:11-15

8619 2018-07-19 05:55:08 I had it and it was one of the best things I ever have done. The pain is gone and I feel better about how clothes fit. The scarring has faded for the most part after using vitamin e oil on the scars.
8620 2018-07-19 05:55:03 1)To put it in clear perspective, which if you're indeed objective and devoid of bias, I expect that you'd understand:

International oil prices averaged $100-150/barrel during GEJ's time, compared to $30-50 when Buhari took over. 

By default, a drop in earning capacity already.
8621 2018-07-19 05:55:02 Add moisturizers, water and  cantu leave in conditioner. Then seal in the  moisture  with some shea butter. My daily hair spray  has drops of vanilla oil, jojoba oil, avacado oil with water... its all about keeping my hair quenched. Lots of deep conditioning.

8628 2018-07-19 05:51:58 Parsing the definition of treason is like splitting the hairs of duplicity: the simple truth is a bunch of pissed off (read “disenfranchised”) American Idiots voted for a snake oil salesman with fewer scruples than a snake.

8630 2018-07-19 05:51:23 Oil may have risen sharply over the past 12 months, but many oil companies have not given up on preparing for "lower for longer" prices. Chevron's new CEO says he wants the company to "thrive at $50"
8631 2018-07-19 05:51:20 i woke up from a dead sleep because i stunk of coconut oil. i had to scrub my skin until it felt like i would bleed, and i still fucking stink of it.
8632 2018-07-19 05:50:53 GEJ opened our Foreign Reserves for his goons to use for their personal whims, with not a single developmental plan executed.

So tell me how that won't affect the country's economy that was already import-based on a single product (oil)?

8674 2018-07-19 05:44:08 We'll likely be the last country to get on board with this. It sickens me. There could be more jobs available in the sustainable energy than in oil and gas, if we went there... but my fear is that at this rate, we'll likely become a third world country if we don't smarten up!

8725 2018-07-19 05:34:30 Russia started investing heavily in this operation around the same time the oil prices plummeted so it shouldnt come as too much of a surprise. Id say Putins motives are this + control of the middle east.

8794 2018-07-19 05:23:21 In any movement there will be what gets called "snake oil".  The real question is does the person or organization provide value to the community and what is the community willing to pay for that value.. Oh wait.. isn't that called capitalism...

8796 2018-07-19 05:23:09 cheers! the key advice with those kinds of machines is to use beans with zero oil on them. dry, light roasts work best and help them last. dark, oily beans will mess them up quick.
8797 2018-07-19 05:23:02 I do use oil but my dad insists she make it with lard.

8820 2018-07-19 05:19:07 You add it to the boiling water to keep it from boiling over as quickly, because it interferes with the bubbles that happen when water boils.

Has nothing to do with the oil you should add when you've taken the pasta out uwu

Also salt makes water boil faster.

8849 2018-07-19 05:14:23 How much do you think higher energy costs are playing into the currency account deficit? Do you think China will begin to draw down on its stockpiles of oil to offset the higher average price of energy? Tough spot if currency is falling and energy is holding up or rising.

8862 2018-07-19 05:12:03 Again with the antisemitic comparison. 

Israel is a pluralistic country. It only took the land because of a direct threat to its security. In a defensive war it is entitled to keep land. 

In fact it gave back the Sinai including oil wells to Egypt for peace. No peace elsewhere.
8863 2018-07-19 05:11:54 The estimation of our reserves were done years ago when oil was discovered. So I doubt am not certain, if Anambra basin was observed. Recent studies shows that the basin seating on natural gas.
8864 2018-07-19 05:11:52 I gotta look into that. Is this like MCT oil?

8875 2018-07-19 05:09:06 Thank God we didn’t have a major oil spill or off shore drilling disaster during the last days of the Obama admin. Trumps people would have just said Obama’s fault and let the oil keep gushing. And Fox would parade around saying this shows dems don’t care about environment.

8877 2018-07-19 05:08:33 Witch hazel is an astringent, which means it removes every bit of dirt/oil from your skin. That makes you prone to drying out, so if you don’t moisturize enough, it could cause your skin to flake. Make sure you use an extra hydrating moisturizer once a day to compensate!

8879 2018-07-19 05:08:12 @realDonaldTrump Since the squeaky wheel gets the oil:  Please look into the outsourcing of medical language specialist (MLS) jobs to India.  I began in this field over 40 years ago, and I loved it.  But MTSs (medical transcription services) took over and we are suffering!

8891 2018-07-19 05:06:01 She did though. She's always handing out moisturizing tips too. Like anytime a friend or family member gets pregnant she starts preaching baby oil and cocoa butter, bc she had five kids but not a single stretch mark.
8892 2018-07-19 05:05:45 Putin is desperate to get to the oil in the Arctic but doesn't have the technology. EXXON does. That was why he gave Tillerson a medal and wanted him to be Secty of State.
8893 2018-07-19 05:05:29 yeah it's CRAZY how close it is! 8-6 makes Mania just BARELY surpass 3&K.. like I could've preferred Oil Ocean in Mania to Sandpolis.. but I HATE Oil Ocean and the original lvl is more aggravating lol.
8894 2018-07-19 05:05:13 i got tea tree oil in my eye and my sister had to basically hold me down and waterboard me with a spray bottle to get it out. 

needless to say, she is my hero and i owe my life to her.
8895 2018-07-19 05:05:12 exactly... for the furor over his EU trip, he did correctly call out Germany for being dependent on russian oil.

it's ironic that HE would be the one to point out someone else's conflict of interests.... but he's not wrong.

he should be pushing for #RE100 but it's all ab oil

8903 2018-07-19 05:04:10 I’m the friend lol. Use lavender oil it will speed up the healing process so the excess scar tissue will shed quicker, I have several piercings and I use lavender oil or tea tree oil (depending on the issue)
8904 2018-07-19 05:04:08 Better than lying about WMD’s and invading a country based on lies. Better than running the CIA, murdering people and overthrowing governments for control of the oil trade. Not to mention selling cocaine in the 80’s. Your entire family are criminals. Go away.

8975 2018-07-19 04:50:35 You don't GM for 35 years without killing plenty of PCs. I've dropped oil barrels from the sky, I've used fleshcrafted ghouls, I've charred characters with lightning bolts & fire, I've crushed skulls with golems and sucked souls with demiliches & torn apart PCs with giant crabs
8976 2018-07-19 04:50:31 You know I will test the shit out of it. Olive olive oil ...... I’ll show myself out
8977 2018-07-19 04:50:18 Take the #oil outages in southern #Iraq into consideration, which might eliminate any remuneration of the additional supply, depending on the amounts of reduction in such situation. Would it really cover the deficit and rebalance the market? I assume it’s merely a political issue
8978 2018-07-19 04:49:55 That's one of the problems. I did indeed read this in 1984. Somewhere between then and now, the Russians got fuzzy. Oil? Murder? Money laundering? Crazy.
8979 2018-07-19 04:49:55 I do if we get rid of the party of hate, the obstructionist and resistors then replace them with people who will actually do the work of the people we can make great progress, We just became the #1 producer of Oil thats a big start to improving all our lives

8991 2018-07-19 04:48:15 I would not worry about the price of oil right now.  Profits are up of oil, oil products and natural gas.  We will be exporting oil and liquid natural gas and these contracts will drive profits higher and dividends higher too.  Loer cost out of the ground does not drive prices DN
8992 2018-07-19 04:48:01 Yes!  I have really paid attention to mayo ingredients lately, and WOW!  Are they horrible!  Most/some have EDTA, and are made with oils that cause inflammation!  We like Chosen foods coconut oil mayo- it is so good on a BLT salad!

9011 2018-07-19 04:44:19 Sir, if you are in online please ensure what Kutamba Rao has  said regarding the ESSAR oil project scandal before the house
9012 2018-07-19 04:44:06 Who of my friends has not tried CBD OIL?
9013 2018-07-19 04:44:04 Good to know the crazies are not just at Disney: ran across one lady, when I asked to pet her puppy got freaky as her puppy is not vaccinated yet and at ten weeks old was already putting it on CBD oil for separation anxiety. Another lady brought in her unfriendly dog. Only me 
9014 2018-07-19 04:44:04 I used to mix what ever leave in I used, a little conditioner, the cream I used and water in a spray bottle and that honestly held my curls lol. I topped it off with a little EVOO, organic coconut oil, or Africa’s Best Ultimate Herbal Oil. To lock in the moisture lol.
9015 2018-07-19 04:44:03 You do realise that BP is a global oil company don't you...
It doesn't just produce oil in Scotland.

9018 2018-07-19 04:43:26 Hard to mass that kind of fortune w/renewable. But the future is renewable energy.
One of Trump’s reoccurring successes is removing barriers to taking out every bit of oil/gas/coal while profits still to be made.
It is the intersection of greed and hate that has brought us here.
9019 2018-07-19 04:43:25 Good stuff MBIE understand the value of jobs, the advantages of gas & oil for NZ. You on your he other hand have no allegiance to NZ being simply a mouth piece for the globalist mega corporation the is McGreenpeace. An organisation answerable to no one !

9032 2018-07-19 04:41:47 I think the demographic shift is one force. A major one in some issues: immigration for ex. & for some like Sessions.
But another one is energy. The vast fortunes of the oligarchy is based on oil. Smaller fortunes on coal.

9049 2018-07-19 04:38:58 Trade wars, oil price hikes short term are not created by Indian govt, how will they fix it? Better infra, solar power and electrification are long term fixes the govt. has done very well at, so what was your point again?

9059 2018-07-19 04:36:14 Ogx kukui oil shampoo and conditioner
9060 2018-07-19 04:36:11 usually dish detergent will get anything oil based out, as long as the fabric isn’t protein based (i.e. not silk, wool, etc. - but even in some cases it’s fine on those as well) or hand wash or bar soap can work - just hand wash the spot using it with warm water

9063 2018-07-19 04:35:54 ohhh, but keep supporting this psycopathic, genocidal government by buying up its oil and gas...  bravo! bravo!!
9064 2018-07-19 04:35:47 This time, the oil is dropped by Bowser, and Mario has two buckets to catch oil with.

9068 2018-07-19 04:34:43 I'm still trying to understand why data costs so much. Data is a virtual item. We can't hold it in our hands. At this rate. Data is gonna be more expensive than oil.

9075 2018-07-19 04:32:34 If you rub lavenders oil on your temples it’s supposed to help. Also a cold press on your eyes. Also- @ Wally World they have this stuff called headache powered it works wonders. Ya girl gets alotta headaches 
9076 2018-07-19 04:32:34 "BP, bringing oil to US shores."
9077 2018-07-19 04:32:32 Hard boiled is probably best, you'll probably need to use butter/oil to make scrambled eggs (unless you do the whole scramble it inside the egg thing) and while it won't kill them it's not really that good for them to eat.
9078 2018-07-19 04:32:16 Mr. @POTUS Why do you keep calling yourself a nobody (via process of elimination)?
'Nobody knew healthcare was so hard'
' " " Lincoln was Republican'
' " " war is very expensive'
' " " what "value-added tax" means'
' " " Iraq has a lot of oil'
' " " being POTUS isn't an easy job'
9079 2018-07-19 04:32:07 Oh that’s about the worst thing you can ever accuse someone of being; I know from experience.

9101 2018-07-19 04:29:02 oil them and they last longer!
9102 2018-07-19 04:27:40 They need @excuse_me_WTF to test if it's quality olive oil
9103 2018-07-19 04:27:37 Both oil and water missing is worrisome. It can be a cracked block, at worst. The high heat and difficult cranking might have done some damage or was an indicator that damage was done. I'll hope for the best!
9104 2018-07-19 04:27:22 If @realDonaldTrump were smart once #OPEC is pumping at the maximum capacity lift the #Iran sanctions or give waivers and you will sink the #oil price. Just a dream. #OOTT

9118 2018-07-19 04:25:22 Three things:
1. Tried "protein pancakes". They're gross.
2. Set my smoke alarm off more than 3 times.
3. In what can only be described as a freak accident, I sent my coconut oil flying over my bar and into my living area where the lid busted off and it splattered everywhere.
9119 2018-07-19 04:25:13 Not to be a thot but I think my future house is going to have brown and white paper towels easily accessible because brown picks up oil and white picks up stuff like water and juice
9120 2018-07-19 04:25:11 i think it’s gonna be so cute! just make sure to get good af hair products (e.g. leave-on argan oil) cause bleach rly killed my hair
9121 2018-07-19 04:24:57 Spare capacity was also kept by traders using QE to do contango trades when oil prices are low and contango unwinds when oil prices increase and curve moves into backwardation - need cheap credit.. who is paying for QE ?

Maybe some century that will change.

9128 2018-07-19 04:24:10 The Chinese dragon is my guess.  But also look at what obama and Saudi’s did to putin with the price of oil.   Maybe another “ruin obama legacy” 
9129 2018-07-19 04:24:00 Dont worry oil off from the highs his assumption is thrown to garbage.

9141 2018-07-19 04:21:28 Seriously. “God” making statues cry olive oil (or in other cases blood) has been seen before and shown to be the works of people. A true act of a deity would be making every nuclear warhead disappear forever.
9142 2018-07-19 04:20:53 Turn your depression into a HOPE celebration.
9143 2018-07-19 04:20:37 You know when you cook and oil pops and you fear for your life
9144 2018-07-19 04:20:35 Oil slick
9145 2018-07-19 04:20:21 We are not meant alone.
9146 2018-07-19 04:20:21 Cam sensor could be 3 things. Not enough engine oil (best and cheapest), dead sensor (2nd cheapest), or timing is off (expensive af, write off pretty much since it's 99 lol)

9148 2018-07-19 04:19:46 That’s an easy one. The statue is hollow, and someone has been filling it up with olive oil, which is now seeping through the statue’s slightly porous surface. Glug, glug, glug...
9149 2018-07-19 04:19:42 fuck oil and gas
9150 2018-07-19 04:19:31 I’m out here trying to cook and the minute I said “am I doing this right” I spilt hot oil all over my arm 
9151 2018-07-19 04:19:12 食用だけじゃない。みんなの生活はオイルによって成り立つ。オイルあっての人間だろ? オイルライフを満喫しようじゃないか。
9152 2018-07-19 04:19:09 Mayonnaise is like someone looking at a jar of vegetable oil and wondering how they could make it even less pleasant to ingest.
9153 2018-07-19 04:18:47 90% percent chance that someone is feeding olive oil into a tube in the statue and using air pressure to force it out near where the tear ducts would be.
9154 2018-07-19 04:18:45 we need to take omega 6 to omega 3 in 4: 1 ratio. Both must be in unadulterated hexane free cold press form. I take 3 tsp of sunflower oil and 1 tsp of flax seed oil daily.
9155 2018-07-19 04:18:44 Why do you think "energy workers" only includes coalminers, oil rig workers, & natural gas workers?

You DO realize that energy workers also include those who make or install solar panels, wind turbines, hydroelectric dams & turbines, geo-thermal energy, & nuclear power, right?

9158 2018-07-19 04:18:24 I love essential oils! Tonight I felt super nauseous. So I put on some of doTERRA’s DigestZen on my feet and got under a warm blanket. I feel fine now! I love the holistic way!!

9171 2018-07-19 04:15:35 No, Russia is one of Germany's energy sources. Only in natural gas is it a MAJOR source (about same level as Germany imports from Norway). But all of Europe of course buys energy where it is available, close by - natural gas deposits are biggest in Russia, Oil in Middle East..

9175 2018-07-19 04:15:14 Ezekiel 38 is about Russia, Iran, Turkey, Libya, and some other nations coming to attack Israel for a spoil (oil , natural gas, booming economy)
9176 2018-07-19 04:15:10 Again

Germany, for example 

9% of its energy usage of from oil and gas

So Russia “shutting it off” will only hurt Russia

9240 2018-07-19 04:05:10 Interesting.. Are MCT oil and olive oil whole foods though?  I understand a little here and there, but you're over 1,000 calories per day of the two.  Probably pretty hard to hit 80% fat without though.
9241 2018-07-19 04:04:50 ....ehh?!//;; Where did all the chili oil go?!
9242 2018-07-19 04:04:24 CASTOR OIL 
Try rubbing a small amount of castor oil on your scalp every night before you go to bed. Castor oil is known to have a positive effect on thinning hair and is known for thickening eyebrows.
9243 2018-07-19 04:04:12 This is no different than when big oil tried to destroy its competition.
9244 2018-07-19 04:04:09 Of course. Nobody, including Trump, knew anything about Tillerson until he was suddenly the SOS. All we knew was that he was close to Putin and was big oil.

9253 2018-07-19 04:02:21 @Bethenny DID NOT eat the soup, smarty pants. She ASKED Ramona what the wrap was and Ramona said, “chicken.” However, the fish could have been cooked using the same oil or utensils, which is why Bethenny didn’t know if the soup had fish in it. Get your facts right. #RHONY

9289 2018-07-19 03:56:40 My dad's first 4wd tractor was that same orange coop implements bearcat. Traded it on a stieger colored ST225 Bearcat in 1981. Might still have it if it had more oil flow to run that air seeder.

9357 2018-07-19 03:47:24 $CEI ive watched this lose for months. Oil is higher whats stopping this from moving up really moving? 38m volume didn't break a measly. 70
9358 2018-07-19 03:47:21 Lavender + coconut oil, people. That is all.
9359 2018-07-19 03:47:15 I have oily skin and I have used Mary Kay’s oil Mattifier and that works really well. Especially in the summer my skin tends to be more oily. I think it $16 a bottle but a little goes a long way.

9361 2018-07-19 03:46:53 Try some CBD oil. It was put together way back for a 9yr old with siezues, he would have like 40 a month. When starting the oil. His siezires subside. I don't think it was the cannabis that caused your siezures. Peace
9362 2018-07-19 03:46:52 Another attempt at a false narrative to try to get others to support the treason accusation.  They will keep attempting the death by a thousand cuts approach.

9389 2018-07-19 03:43:32 I thought that the new noises my truck has been making would all stop when I got the oil changed... I thought wrong. The noises are louder so I guess I’ll have to turn my music up a little loud

9410 2018-07-19 03:40:52 ah, interesting! does this mean that it would be better mixed with an oil moisturizer than something like a water cream? i know it's supposed to be refrigerated to help with the light/air sensitivity

9426 2018-07-19 03:39:20 There are 7 refineries in all of Asia who can handle our bitumen. None of them want it. And nobody else is going to build the facility required to handle it. Not when there are abundant supplies of better quality oil.
9427 2018-07-19 03:39:18 everybody knows that when the orange man opens his mouth, his staff prays for help #resist
9428 2018-07-19 03:39:18 This bitch had the audacity to report me to HR, I can’t believe it... saying I always spray hand sanitizer after talking to her.... umm bitch you look like a walking disease, you should be glad I don’t cover you in bless oil. Smh
9429 2018-07-19 03:38:59 I couldn’t have gotten through this stressful day without help of others. It’s something I struggle with but today I broke a barrier of vulnerability and I feel grateful. Let’s work together more and just get shit done. Also couldn’t have done it w/o my beloved CBD oil.

9443 2018-07-19 03:38:06 Now what asshole is waking up and pouring olive oil on this statue??
9444 2018-07-19 03:38:05 (Bonus points for playing second fiddle to Dick Cheney and the oil industry in the case of Bush whilst murdering 1.3 MILLION innocent Iraqis according to a recent report.)
9445 2018-07-19 03:38:04 He is corrupt, evil, none professional. Load on earth.
He should go and do Italian olive oil massage to his congi boss.

9449 2018-07-19 03:37:24 what, you don't want five dollars off a case of motor oil and a giant pink thermos? You trippin. 
9450 2018-07-19 03:37:23 you’re so curious & I love it!
- I’m pro w milk, biggest thing is just not dry eggs!
- simple (tomatoes onions garlic jalapeño! I also love doña salsa aka jalapeños blended w olive oil), v hot but not overwhelming
- flour is norm but for GF fresh corn are amazing
- no hot sauce!
9451 2018-07-19 03:37:21 Once the sliced bread hits the olive oil and salt proportionally distributed on a flat plate it’s a game changer.

9459 2018-07-19 03:36:34 NSA - Naval intelligence was created to stop deep state after the 911 attack on America, we launched the attack on the Pentagon to shut it down...

CIA Drugrunning, Bush's drug Cartel and oil Cartels helped fund deep state.

Trump cut Afghanistan $1.6 Trillion a year in opium...
9460 2018-07-19 03:36:34 I'm not sure we can attribute that to Trump because he hasn't been around long enough to make an impact-- the way things are going, I fear he may make the U.S. a pariah state and crash the economy and take oil with him.  He is a NY Suit.  Doesn't love or like oil.  #OOTT
9461 2018-07-19 03:36:26 That’s what I had to do! I moved to Nevada and it messed up my skin. The oil is great
9462 2018-07-19 03:36:08 You can think all you want man. That private corporation that's pulling it out of the ground isn't doing so as a feature of charity to benefit texans

Anyway the conversation is dumb and moot. Our #1 oil trading partner is Canada. Presumably we start there
9463 2018-07-19 03:36:02 They are all soaked in Russian oil deals

If people started taking pride in dem surroundings & depend on govt helper
9467 2018-07-19 03:35:01 3/5 Some economists have suggested that Venezuela’s economy floundered due to its nearly complete reliance on oil. When oil was near record highs per barrel, their economy boomed. But with the current glut, they’re starving in the streets. #H1182
9468 2018-07-19 03:34:56 I love cabbage, cooked in a little butter and peanut oil, seasoned well with salt and pepper and sprinkled with Worcestershire sauce.  Tight fitting lid on large skillet.

9476 2018-07-19 03:33:22 Interesting fact for our #oil #trader friends: 300k barrels of oil & refined fuels a day the Trans Mountain line ships from Alberta to Canada’s Pacific coast make their way to Asia @canuck2usa @GlobalProTrader @Saburgs @jimcramer @jonnajarian #investors #investing #markets
9477 2018-07-19 03:33:18 it is clear by you repeating GIFs that you can't accept the facts. Whether is tar sands pollution, threats of oil spills on the coast, or the fact that protesters have the right of #FreedomOfSpeech and BC govt has the right to stand up to big oil. #bcpoli #cdnpoli #StopKM
9478 2018-07-19 03:33:00 Is it.... is it.... hen.... HENNESY?! Or... an oil change for your car?  is henny!
9479 2018-07-19 03:32:58  Tell that to the children who have to practice oil and gas evacuation drills in case of explosions, fires or spills. No. Mega pads concentrated in residential areas is the industrialization of CO. When you go bust, we’ll have a wasteland. #orphanwells
9480 2018-07-19 03:32:57 Great mug and YES there are oil wells in Colorado! The mug is a winner
9481 2018-07-19 03:32:37 As in bed as they are with big oil, they are pro America and pro democracy. Makes for some strange bedfellows! #Impeach45 #FamiliesBelongTogether #BlueWave2018
9482 2018-07-19 03:32:23 Made a big bowl of Caesar, and then made my own sauce. 
3 table spoons of mayo, 1 table spoon of soy sauce, 1 table spoon of olive oil, mix together until it's one whole mass, then pour it into the salad. 
Place the salad in the fridge for 15 minutes and then enjoy.
9483 2018-07-19 03:32:22 Anyone else willing to help Mike get across the country to protest oil ships carrying imported crude to the East coast? If #Greenpeace  actually cares about making the world a better place they'd be focusing more there

9487 2018-07-19 03:31:41 Numbnuts: when oil comes out od the ground in Texas, the company that did so sells it off to the world market. There is no state controlled Texas ministry of oil that prevents this from happening. It does not stay in your state. Get a damn clue
9488 2018-07-19 03:31:39  Tell that to the children who have to practice oil and gas evacuation drills in case of explosions, fires or spills. No. Mega pads concentrated in residential areas is the industrialization of CO. When you go bust, we’ll have a wasteland. #orphanwells

9492 2018-07-19 03:30:41 My understanding is Putin installed Tillerson. He won a special Medal of Honor in Russia. He had the oil background and the original plan was remove sanctions and Trump and Tillerson, maybe others, would get a % share of Rosneft. It was all about oil and a pipeline at first.

9496 2018-07-19 03:30:13 This oil is taking forever to get hot, is God telling me not to eat plantains? Cause I can’t hear it.
9497 2018-07-19 03:30:11 Needless to say, lemon essential oil is pretty amazing and can be used to help kill off the bacteria and microbes that cause sore throat. You can use lemon essential oil in a gargle, throat spray, steam, and even topically on the jawline and throat.
9498 2018-07-19 03:30:08 Where’s Oil Can Boyd?
9499 2018-07-19 03:30:07 That's not interesting, and it's not misleading. That's a cheap, slimy, bastard of a snake lying to sell snake oil.
9500 2018-07-19 03:29:59 Setakat ni la kan. Kebanyakan geng2 oil n gas ni aku tanya semua produk daripada politeknik

9502 2018-07-19 03:29:25 He’s still selling that snake oil?
9503 2018-07-19 03:29:23 I have not been there, done that, but I did once get habanero oil in my eyes after washing my hands improperly
9504 2018-07-19 03:29:20 Tadi mau nyobain 424 yang lagi rame

So far keren sih 4 menit oil cleansingnya, deadskin nya pada keangkat masa
9505 2018-07-19 03:29:09 Is it extra virgin olive oil though?
9506 2018-07-19 03:28:59 Life long conservative until the last election.  I won't go back to the UCP. We don't need a backward looking government who will keep us in the past. Cons had 40 years to prepare for a transition away from oil and did squat.
9507 2018-07-19 03:28:51 Yes because it those not any other resource to hang by while oil prices go up
9508 2018-07-19 03:28:36 animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
9509 2018-07-19 03:28:25 It’s interesting cause you actually just fry each side in oil, no steaming/adding water

9512 2018-07-19 03:28:06 my essential oil diffuser is turning on and off by itself. there might be a ghost in my new house
9513 2018-07-19 03:28:04 I doubt seriously that olive oil has ever been anywhere near a Papa John's pizza.
9514 2018-07-19 03:27:59 Does not help Autism at all!!
Snake oil!
9515 2018-07-19 03:27:56 You don't have your own oil dude you have oil that goes out on the world market and then is bought back and sold to gas stations etc. Damn man get a clue how the world works
9516 2018-07-19 03:27:53 I love the Luna Sleeping oil! Mixed with good genes of course. You gotta have the acid too. It makes my face like baby butt.

9522 2018-07-19 03:26:52 Thank you so much. I was thinking that with Maggi seasoning and some oil (delicious with grilled onions!!!), but did not think of Worcestershire, which I like.
I will give it a try.
Thank you so much...

9525 2018-07-19 03:26:39 Someone broke a weather thermometer in the store today, so another person and I had to clean the oil and glass up.
After I inhaled it, I found out it might be toxic.

9526 2018-07-19 03:26:38 Not to mention the Pres bombing Syria after chemicals despite threats from putin 
Putting missiles in Ukraine 
Added sanctions to Russia 
Asked Merkel why not buy oil from USA instead of Russia 
Put sanctions back on Iran Russia’s buddy

9529 2018-07-19 03:26:16 My brother is 28 years old and has the nerve to tell me that he forgets to get oil changes on his 1998 civic. And now there’s smoking coming out of his vents. Im fucking weak.
9530 2018-07-19 03:26:12 Omg.. I am happy you take something to help you!! I have recently learned of that CDB oil... Why don't the doctors tell me about this?! Grr.. Thank you again and God bless.
9531 2018-07-19 03:25:41 Like a oil pen homie?
9532 2018-07-19 03:25:18 They sell the same oil at Logos bookstore for like $7.
9533 2018-07-19 03:25:17 Can they change oil? Or not be a fuck boy?
9534 2018-07-19 03:24:58 Hub oil always makes a bigger mess than what you've really lost right? 

Right?

9536 2018-07-19 03:24:44 Is it VIRGIN olive oil? If not, she has some explaining to do...
9537 2018-07-19 03:24:42 After the baby oil and peanut butter
9538 2018-07-19 03:24:38 そうして夕方にはスリットから塩を吹いてしまうのね
その辺イヤがる連中は下半身のガードはしそう
胸は知らん
9539 2018-07-19 03:24:31 oil spills...
9540 2018-07-19 03:24:30 try baby oil lol
9541 2018-07-19 03:24:25 We plan to be profitable by year three - the key assumption is that an armored car crashes through our office wall and spills its contents... and don't stand where the comet is assumed to strike oil.
9542 2018-07-19 03:24:13 Remember when he said that oil would not rise above 50usd in his lifetime... Wtf does he keep getting airtime?
9543 2018-07-19 03:24:02 you can use walnut oil, olive oil,coconut oil, flaxseed oil just to name a few. You have variety of options
9544 2018-07-19 03:23:56 Maybe expensive but for severe Anxiety would highly recommend trying a higher dose. Personally for me I am taking CBDPure 600 oil and vaping 1500mg vape. And it worked wonders for my Anxiety to the point of no more pills from the docs. My health was well worth the costs.
9545 2018-07-19 03:23:55 The A πeam!
9546 2018-07-19 03:23:53 I really don’t know if there’s anything more depressing than going to a vape store. I just want a battery so I can smoke reefer oil cartridges in public. I don’t need one that’s the size of a smart car battery. I smoke herb but I still like to get laid.
9547 2018-07-19 03:23:47 Made with oil squeezed from 21 virgin VW Bugs

9551 2018-07-19 03:23:33 you know the answer. because the devil USA is overall there to bringing peace freedom and DEMOCRACY.  and why?  thats only for oil.
9552 2018-07-19 03:23:27 They constantly fight with the laws & all the GR dispensers get gutted pretty much annually. It’s far more logical to just grow your own in a broom closet and hope for the best at this point. Shit they even went for CBD oil recently. Shame. I actually use that.
9553 2018-07-19 03:23:19 If this was real I'd be a bit disappointed in God. 
Yay, there's oil on a statue now. Good job. 

Meanwhile everything's on fire.
9554 2018-07-19 03:23:14 I’m making steak with truffle oil  prepping for my dinner date tomorrow lol
9555 2018-07-19 03:23:11 Don’t allow regulations to be lifted that allow oil co’s to mine with open pits. Don’t allow bears to be shot while hibernating. Pass laws that reward and encourage public, not private ed. Want me to go on?
9556 2018-07-19 03:23:05 First go at oil, looks good to me. There is always room for improvement. Keep going! Enjoy yourself.
9557 2018-07-19 03:22:59 休出お疲れ様。時間は了解なんだが店は何処になったん？
9558 2018-07-19 03:22:51 Where do you get the weed juice/oil?
9559 2018-07-19 03:22:28 And needs oil change
9560 2018-07-19 03:22:19 I think it's very important that we all understand macro economics, 
Linking few defaulters with the government is not correct..
 India is oil dependant country and setting up refinery is not a joke..

9563 2018-07-19 03:22:09 Did you tell her not to pump so much Russian Oil???
Unless her name is Malarki
9564 2018-07-19 03:22:03 Someone put it there. No inanimate object can produce oil derived from an olive. Why is this a thing? It’s like saying ‘where did this graffiti on this train car come from?’
9565 2018-07-19 03:22:00 no it wasn't discovered? thats bullshit. Weed calms down people with anger problems. and has no negative effects on you. and cannabis oil cures cancer.
9566 2018-07-19 03:21:58 You're very welcome. I'm the research queen and loathe western medicine. I've tried many many things. I also have Lupus, Rheumatoid Arthritis & Ovarian Cancer.  The DMSO REALLY WORKS. Also the CBD oil. Good luck sweetie. Sending you healing energy!

9570 2018-07-19 03:21:30 If you're so overburdened by regulations and the carbon tax NOW, why is it that Alberta is on the hook for tens of billions in clean up liabilities from decades ago and could barely keep a balanced budget with oil over $100? Wtf were you doing then?
9571 2018-07-19 03:21:06 “DONT get it twisted, I wake up every morning to a head scarf and coconut oil, I am married to a black QUEEN” where is my Randall Pearson?
9572 2018-07-19 03:21:03 Then same to apply for oil companiees to hav free market.. why do we all blame when petrol price goes up. And when farmers decides his farm product price, then everyone jumps on inflation gun

9574 2018-07-19 03:20:52 Fed Powell commented that economy on steady growth with risk to escalating trade conflict. Trump said separate trade talk with Mexico and later with Canada. Brent oil@ 72.80, DXY @ 95.05. Rupee exp to open@ 68.66
9575 2018-07-19 03:20:38 I need an oil change 
9576 2018-07-19 03:20:23 She’s been spending like $500 a year and my dad douses bottles of oil to “help” him sleep and I almost suffocate every few days. Mums obsessed with convention too and tickets are pricy.
9577 2018-07-19 03:20:23 I can explain it. An a**hole w olive oil is pouring it down the statue. Duh.
9578 2018-07-19 03:20:15 The statue is weeping chrism, the perfumed oil used in the sacraments. As St Thomas Aquinas said (and quoted in "The Song of Bernadette") "For those with faith, no explanation is necessary; for those without faith, no explanation is possible." James Martin, SJ

9580 2018-07-19 03:19:50 Sekera Larsson nuge. All huge parts of the lineup in my opinion. All have 3 seasons left with the oil until they can either resign for more money or walk....that's your number 1 right d. You're number 1 lw or number 2 center and a top 4 dman( when healthy). These guys deserve 1/2
9581 2018-07-19 03:19:50 the only good oil production is leaving it in the fucking ground

9584 2018-07-19 03:19:31 I can’t wait to see what the ultimate explanation is!  Surely it’s real olive oil. Surely it’s not a hoax.  Surely the investigators aren’t idiots and the reporters trying to build up a story!

9600 2018-07-19 03:17:27 i give my 11 yr great white pyrenees with hip dysplasia cbd oil & he has gone from whimpering on the floor to jumping on the bed and playing outside :,-) if that doesn’t say something about the plant idk what does 
9601 2018-07-19 03:17:25 @FrontRowBrian Have you got the oil on this Jeremy Botter / Loretta hunt situation? Lots of negative stuff flying Botters way in the last few weeks.
9602 2018-07-19 03:17:12 But drink a litre of olive oil and see how high it goes.
9603 2018-07-19 03:17:11 He is raising the issue so he can pull out of NATO.  He said he doesn’t want to pay for Montenegro.  Like he pulled that country his brain? Not likely Putin wants to overtake Montenegro for access to the ports for his oil.  Think People Think
9604 2018-07-19 03:16:44 Olive oil, lime with salt & pepper.
9605 2018-07-19 03:16:31 Add a small (read: teaspoon) amount of olive or canola oil and your pot won’t boil over!
9606 2018-07-19 03:16:25 Actually Canadians do care about the enviroment and there is wide concern of a oil spill on the cost which would be more devastating if it was toxic bitumen. Tankers and pipelines leak, and it would be a disaster. #bcpoli #cdnpoli #StopKM #protecttheinlet #KeepItInTheGround
9607 2018-07-19 03:16:22 Our trick is to drink fish oil, it helps and citrusfruit. I haven't had a cold or flu the last 3 years since I started using fish oil. You get used to the winters and metal sounds much better in the brutal darkness 
9608 2018-07-19 03:16:18 Not really a lot of gold and oil there.
9609 2018-07-19 03:16:05 Your Whataboutism is amusing, assuming that we don't care about those issues . BTW, Trump couldn't wait to destabilize the ME further by moving the Embassy to Jerusalem and doubling their US aid to around 60 billion. SA is ignored for oil and buying US arms but tick tock 
9610 2018-07-19 03:15:58 Greenspan was correct it was a war for oil. The 911 pilots were ALL Saudi Arabians. So we went to Iraq?Our pipelines and ARAMCO interests  were more important than our soldiers lives. Our new embassy in Baghdad is larger than Vatican City. We are occupiers,.
9611 2018-07-19 03:15:58 Evening primrose oil is good for women health
9612 2018-07-19 03:15:45 So, why do we still buy oil from other countries?
9613 2018-07-19 03:15:39 Of late I've wondered if all the hoopla about Russia is to distract from the real threat of the PRC. Russia's economy is about the size of Italy (on a good day when oil is high).
9614 2018-07-19 03:15:27 hmm.. a regular job or a job in the oil field?

9617 2018-07-19 03:15:08 coconut oil; rub it on your lashes and they will fall out/ come out
9618 2018-07-19 03:15:08 I'm assuming that dying in the countries you listed is much more important that Montenegro because of (a) oil, and (b) they're great places to sell American weapons to in order to prop up the local tyrants and/or the new govts the US installed after knocking off the previous ones
9619 2018-07-19 03:15:06 Maxwell's Double Large Cup O' Columbine, now with Dijon ketchup 'n' Mustard oil
9620 2018-07-19 03:15:00 We Indians buy oils based on price of oil available nearby. Oil market is extremely volatile. Price regulations is needed by govt intervention. Nutritional values desirable and actual must be displayed on the pack

9637 2018-07-19 03:11:46 
9638 2018-07-19 03:11:44 @realDonaldTrump . It's obvious trump discussed personal business e.g. hotels and oil and gas.
9639 2018-07-19 03:11:35 Gotta have that peppermint oil on standby.

9647 2018-07-19 03:10:24 The best part about giving my dog some hemp oil is him relaxedly rolling around in bed taking up all my space. This dog is high.
9648 2018-07-19 03:10:23 Oh, dear. Does anyone know what they weather outlook is? I only have two hickory handled iron knives & they rust if they get wet! Maybe I better oil them after I sharpen them.

9669 2018-07-19 03:08:25 Man the mental gymnastics a lot of fans go to justify every move the #oilers make. It is absolutely crazy to watch.

9674 2018-07-19 03:07:30 Maybe there's olive oil inside the statue.
9675 2018-07-19 03:06:54 Eh to act like there was “no capitalism” before 1800 is kind of stupid.

Or to act like capitalism is the main reason for growth. Oil/electricity was probably more important to GDP growth than capitalism
9676 2018-07-19 03:06:51 Who is talking about oil?you are missing the point!

9683 2018-07-19 03:05:22 I am old enough to remember Reagan and Gorbachev, and that is the ONLY time we were on the brink of a war with Russia--Clinton as SoS didn't ever come close! Putin is desperate for funds because oil isn't cutting it. Only Putin's minions are concerned about kool-aid about Russia.

9688 2018-07-19 03:04:18 Sorry, but, . 

Perchance a wily priest is pouring oil in the statue?
9689 2018-07-19 03:04:14 Right, that's why all the workers are walking off the job, stealing what they can from the government owned oil company.
9690 2018-07-19 03:04:10 You seem to be a bit vague in your knowledge. Are you being paid by the oil companies?
9691 2018-07-19 03:03:58 goodnight everyone remember to put coconut/olive/castor oil on ur brows and lids before u sleep so ur brows and lashes grow thicc and strong <3
9692 2018-07-19 03:03:52 so how was the car ride home with all that oil in your crack?????
9693 2018-07-19 03:03:36 Do you have any essential oils? I recommend tea tree oil, maybe peppermint or lavender. They’re real bad this year.
9694 2018-07-19 03:03:29 Is it extra-virgin olive oil? 
9695 2018-07-19 03:03:28 Tumeric and Cayenne pepper cocktail (1 tbs of tumeric and teaspoon of Cayenne mix in 1/2 tsp olive oil and two ounces of water) .  Swish it in your mouth 5xs daily and swallow
9696 2018-07-19 03:03:26 #AspenSecurity - If hacking into the DNC servers was an attack on our country, then shouldn’t NATO invoke Article 5?

9700 2018-07-19 03:02:36 no, but I have tried Vaseline and olive oil and they both work pretty well! The vaseline really helps with separation of the lashes
9701 2018-07-19 03:02:35 @realDonaldTrump I can’t believe you actually thought you could keep deceiving your supporters and thinking you was going to get your little oil deal with Putin and just ride off into the sunset!

9715 2018-07-19 03:00:11 Dude you clearly have no idea how the oil/gas markets work. You think they just pocket it and keep it here at home? Jfc what a buffoon
9716 2018-07-19 03:00:08 It is reduced for all the countries in the world because of high rates of oil

9721 2018-07-19 02:59:11 Why do you think Obama allowed rape of native American land by oil companies, the actual doing is irrelevant, just bow, Obama knows how much Native Americans have lost, the little they have left he says screw you, water is still contaminated in Flint Michigan
9722 2018-07-19 02:59:05 @RealKidPoker Hey man. Love the vlogs! I was just wondering what your opinion on supplements while working out is? I’m doing Creatine, Weigh Protein, fish oil and multivitamins with occasional pre-workout for #myultimatesweat

9727 2018-07-19 02:57:53 It is NOT olive juice. Olives do not have juice. Press an olive you get oil. The stuff they put in your “dirty martini” (vodkatini) is brine, it’s the liquid that olives sit in to gain their flavor. It’s olive brine, not juice. Carry on...
9728 2018-07-19 02:57:51 That’s olive oil that’s never even thought about sex

9758 2018-07-19 02:53:38 Peppermint oil mixed with lavender lotion massaged into my hamstrings and lower back/tailbone. Oh man. Bliss. 

Sweet dreams to me.
9759 2018-07-19 02:53:18 An excellent asymmetric pressure point. I would just buy the oil for the hell of it, regardless of demand, to undermine the US.
9760 2018-07-19 02:53:00 That isn't where oil comes from.
9761 2018-07-19 02:52:50 I love being tan but when you’re as pale as me fake tanning is SO time consuming! Spray, St. Tropez, oil....doesn’t matter. UGH
9762 2018-07-19 02:52:48 Not to mention that even if you didn't intentionally cover baby ducks in oil you still took "footage" of a man made disaster that took the lives of countless animals and used it in the name of exploitation to sell more @ProcterGamble products. Thus, perpetuating #animaltesting
9763 2018-07-19 02:52:47 It’s crystal clear @BlairKing_ca and you know it!

9766 2018-07-19 02:52:38 He pushes NATO to increase defense spending, which is not in Russia's interest, he criticizes EU & Germany for spending billions on Russian oil, which props up Putin, and he increases our own defenses while now exporting oil & gas to challenge Russia. Yet he is weak on Russia?
9767 2018-07-19 02:52:33 Oily skin
Clays: are highly absorbent helps draw out impurities from the skin and clear pores.
Charcoal: Contains a variety of minerals and works to absorb oil and impurities from the skin. 
Sulfur: It will absorb excess oil on the skin and it also has antibacterial properties

9770 2018-07-19 02:52:22 Miga, mas acho que pra técnica de oil cleansing não tem problema, até porque você vai retirar todo o óleo com o seu sabonete facial. Agora, realmente acho que para hidratar, não sei se é recomendado pra pele acneica, é bom perguntar pra uma dermato. Pra mim tá rolando!
9771 2018-07-19 02:52:19 The olive oil lubes my throat up so I can suck more burgers down
9772 2018-07-19 02:52:07 Tillerson is no surprise. Exxon and Rosneft was on hold since 2014. The expectation was Tillerson would work to get sanctions lifted and oil would flow. When it didn’t happen, Tillerson was no longer needed.
9773 2018-07-19 02:51:57 Someone paint an oil portrait of me. Thanks!
9774 2018-07-19 02:51:48 I love to put olive oil on my hamburgers
9775 2018-07-19 02:51:38 And don't forget getting President Trump to attack Germany for buying Russian oil! Man that just proves to those loopy libs that Trump is Putin's "puppet"! LOL!

9784 2018-07-19 02:50:20 A LITTLE TOO LATE. @realDonaldTrump doesn’t give a crap about the lives of the horses or any animals. They want to make money for ranchers, probably create more game reserves for hunting and get at the minerals  and any oil they can on these public lands. SMH

9795 2018-07-19 02:49:31 There's an alternative with straws: pasta straws. Also there are compressed cornstarch utensils. We have alternatives, just that plastic is "cheaper" and the oil companies have their grubby mitts in everything.

9831 2018-07-19 02:46:23 Sure you work for Big Oil and I am the Earl of Sandwich. Germany could have bought energy from another NATO member, but I guess not caring Germany is funding Russia unless somehow Trump is benefitting illustrates a higher reasoning that escapes most sane people.

9843 2018-07-19 02:44:48 My exact thoughts tonight as I’m putting coconut oil in my hair
9844 2018-07-19 02:44:46 Such an odd report. Isn’t it pretty likely the sculptor filled it with perfume olive oil.
9845 2018-07-19 02:44:44 I have to go into work late tomorrow because my mom won't let me borrow her car while mine is getting an oil change and inspected. Classy.
9846 2018-07-19 02:44:33 sweet almond oil.
9847 2018-07-19 02:44:20 It's a hoax. A piece of metal cannot "weep" olive oil unless there is a human behind it. Bullshit!
9848 2018-07-19 02:44:13 Well she's not indearing herself with the Democratic party by campaigning with the Snake Oil Salesman against a solid loyal Democrat in Kansas.
9849 2018-07-19 02:43:58 Tasha Cobbs got the oil you hear me
9850 2018-07-19 02:43:51 取ったこと無い科目が多いから何とも言えない所はあるけど、多分祭祀関係は深いし意味分からないとこ有ると思う。勉強したいなら小林先生の神道史学は良いと思う。もふたろにはおすすめ。
9851 2018-07-19 02:43:48 #peaceistheprize the was no collusion. #NorthKorea is moving toward #denuclearization Russia is helping create an oil glut to hopefully collapse the price of oil to break #Iran and #Venezuela. #Syrians are returning to #Syria. #peacebuilding
9852 2018-07-19 02:43:19 Oh so it’s sunflower oil. I love that one. A nice delicate flavor vs the heaviness of olive or coconut.
9853 2018-07-19 02:42:53 Cause it's cheap and the fragrance wears off fast. Boil vinegar to remove odors. Use pine sol or Murphy's oil soap for cleaning fragrance. Use potpourri if youmust have the fabulouso fragrance.
9854 2018-07-19 02:42:48 A large cup of coffee with lots of MCT oil - perfect way to start the day. Going to kill it today. Lots of work to be done, lots of asses to be kicked. #carpediem PAR ASPERA AD ASTRA

9865 2018-07-19 02:41:12 Concurrently, you ignore Trump's policies of selling missiles to Poland, ousting of ‘diplomats’ & closing Consulates & EU Oil & Gas from Russia, enriching Russia w/ capital, when this could be purchased from the US. And denounce Trump for stating NATO can pay more for its defense

Any other big drills on the horizon?

9878 2018-07-19 02:39:31 Who tasted it to figure out that it was indeed olive oil??
9879 2018-07-19 02:39:29 Avocado oil, sunflower mixed oils too!
9880 2018-07-19 02:39:25 Lmao I love that this one girl at school was told to buy castor oil for her eyebrows/lashes and she went out and bought a whole ass bottle of canola oil
9881 2018-07-19 02:39:19 @realDonaldTrump Praise God for him choosing you as America's Pres & returning us to prosperity & helping Israel! God's prophets said He will bless America & Israel with the world's oil, while the world's oil drying up. Also the money from oil will clean up our nation's debt.
9882 2018-07-19 02:38:55 Xantl, long path of evidence that I should summarize some day.  But, you can start by looking at who was funding Ann Dunham's work in Indonesia.  Then note the wars, oil pipelines and overthrown goverments
9883 2018-07-19 02:38:44 Just spray some anti-stick chemicals or olive oil in a mug n ur good
9884 2018-07-19 02:38:36 I tried when I gave you all my stuff and you left all pissy bc I forced olive oil on you!
9885 2018-07-19 02:38:33 I wonder how Putin became one of the richest billionaires on the planet on a measles salary of 112k annually. Maybe the state oil company shares profits with the Pres & maybe enough left over for trump as payment. Duh!
9886 2018-07-19 02:38:31 So Trump said he was going to give Putin a little gift - hampering Venezuelan oil so thoughtful of DT. #traitor
9887 2018-07-19 02:38:16 Yep, but that flashing oil light scares me so planning to change the oil and filter before attacking that check engine light.
9888 2018-07-19 02:38:03 Try using peppermint oil, rub it on your temples and relax for a while. It sounds odd but it really works. Just remember to mix it with a carrier oil or water and not to use to much. I hope that helps, and I hope you feel better.
9889 2018-07-19 02:38:01 This beard oil got my face lookin like it got squirted on

9898 2018-07-19 02:37:17  Does that make it "extra - extra virgin" olive oil?
9899 2018-07-19 02:37:17 Palm oil!

Please contact other sources beside the oil industry for  your stories.

9913 2018-07-19 02:34:42 if you heat up coconut oil and chocolate chips in a microwave and mix them together you make a mix that is a liquid at room temperature (generally) but freezes solid on ice cream. home made ice cream shell. it's the only knowledge i have worth spreading.

9915 2018-07-19 02:34:11 Twinning the #TMX is about selling oil to Asia according to the real experts on this topic, the Gov’t of Canada. We were promised a Spill Response to protect our coast from this activity that, by the Serene Sea has begun already. You’re not the expert on this BlairKing_ca !
9916 2018-07-19 02:34:04 The author of that article from Salemnews is not very knowledgeable about oil pipelines, what’s in them, why the oil doesn’t just head west from where it comes out of the ground, and TransCanada’s reputation as corporate steward. However, carry on doing your excellent work. :)

9919 2018-07-19 02:33:33 One thing I have noticed with the high quality fish oil, my skin looked better.  Much better...If you give someone evening primrose oil, fish oil, and sea buckthorn oil, they skin looks fantastic.
9920 2018-07-19 02:33:31 Indeed.  The next logical step for Russia was to undo the Magnitsky Act, to turn over the whistleblowers so they can be killed, and undo post-Sochi sanctions.  Also continuing cyber-warfare and convincing 7 Senators to work to ship oil through the US.  The enemy is in the walls.

9925 2018-07-19 02:32:39 Vs. waiting until they are old enough to consent... they will choose to not have to go though weeks of recovery. As for the scar, bio oil won’t remove a hole in your ear, which is why i was confused on why they would be using oil to remove a scar.

9975 2018-07-19 02:26:32 @QuadrantEnergy & Carnarvon Petroleum made a significant oil discovery. Dorado-1 was in @WM_UpstreamAPAC top 10 APAC wells to watch in 2018. Alone or combined with nearby undeveloped fields/prospects could lead to the first commercial development in the offshore Canning Basin
9976 2018-07-19 02:26:19 I agree with Rand Paul and Tucker Carlson about NATO. If Germany is contracting with Russia for its gas and oil then for the Germans, Russia isn't an enemy to be feared.  NATO countries should not have strategic trade relations with supposed adversaries. What's the point of NATO?
9977 2018-07-19 02:26:17 He didn't need to do that in person. This meeting was darker. I/E giving up 12 Americans to him for interrogation. And remove oil drilling sanctions.
9978 2018-07-19 02:26:16 What types of oil/oil blends do you use to help relax, unwind, sleep, focus, stay positive, etc.? I’m currently using Chill Pill from @AuraCacia in my diffuser and I’m a novice itching to try more #selfcare #essentialoils #aromatherapy
9979 2018-07-19 02:26:15 That '72-'74 time frame has often seemed to me to be right about the time that nuclear power's momentum got halted.......ironically, right when it should have taken off with the oil embargo (of course, I was born in '84, so my knowledge of that period is limited)

9981 2018-07-19 02:26:12 We're un-church people called in to take a look?  Any doctors called in to examine the tear ducts?  Anybody open the back of the hinged skull to see if she needs an oil change and lube?
9982 2018-07-19 02:26:03 All true of course! Isn’t China very vulnerable regarding its oil supplies? History does have a habit of alliances against the strongest foes but a Russia USA one is a better fit! Overthrow the mullahs in Iran and voila! Hell Russia could even take it! We keep Saudi Arabia! Lol!

9986 2018-07-19 02:25:39 Thank you Michael!! My theory is that Donald wants the oil rigs in the Black Sea... in order to get them, he has to be buddies with puttin and reverse sanctions... the 2 hour meeting was probably about reducing sanctions, getting rid of NATO, creating tariffs on

10001 2018-07-19 02:23:38 If you want @RT_Erdogan to do sth, just tell him about airing his dirty laundry, it will definitely help. That's what Putin and Merkel does. E.g.:15 July aotocoup, Swiss bank accounts, Oil sales to ISIS etc.
10002 2018-07-19 02:23:20 Don’t use any styling products unless absolutely necessary, don’t use cheap shower products(shampoo+conditioner), if you have to style your hair use thermal protectant and use some sort of smoothing cream/oil in your hair every time you get out of the shower

10007 2018-07-19 02:22:30 What has happened to the rosemary & olive oil flavor of Triscuits? Did you stop making them?! These were the best Triscuits by far. Milwaukee appears to have suffered a shortage. @TheRealTriscuit 
10008 2018-07-19 02:22:13 So how do you know it’s olive oil and not something else
10009 2018-07-19 02:22:12 So angry over this.  I’m literally shaking that this complete & total snake oil salesmen has taken a sledgehammer to the United States and NO ONE stops him or puts him in check.  

Our Congress is complicit and it’s a disgrace.  How did we ever get here.
