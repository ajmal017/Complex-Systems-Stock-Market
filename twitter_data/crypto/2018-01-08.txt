69 2018-01-08 23:56:36 Watch the interview edgar did with Jay Crypto on Youtube. Edgar explains perfect why hes not fully committed to Bitcoin Cash. He makes perfect sense
70 2018-01-08 23:56:33 Will look at Tomorrow, sleepy time now :)
71 2018-01-08 23:56:32 Trading fees?
72 2018-01-08 23:56:24 That’s the only way I trade. Charts and nothing else
73 2018-01-08 23:56:23 Finally moved initial investment + 20% profits into cash today. Feels good to secure some profits and still have more money in crypto than I started with :O
74 2018-01-08 23:56:23 its bizzare more people didnt get into crypto who already spend so much of their time online.. pretty counterintuitive. here’s an opportunity to pretty easily 10x your money and you just mock it like anything else instead of take advantage? .. i mean, you knew about it! .. idgiii

77 2018-01-08 23:56:02 the probs is when crypto went hot this didnt recently, and now that crypto is down. who knows....
78 2018-01-08 23:55:55 @dc151 Let me know if you want me to present my HiTag2 crypto talk at your meetings. I’ve just done @dc441452 and it went down quite well.
79 2018-01-08 23:55:52 Transaction throughput (Tx/s) is a meaningless crypto metric, just like Market Cap. 

Far more relevant is purchasing power. How much purchasing power is transferred? How much is sacrificed (Tx fees) to transact? This is one way to measure #SkinInTheGame
80 2018-01-08 23:55:46 Crypto can be used for both of us to transact money and settle into fiat without paying fees. How can you say there is no value in that? Looking at the bigger picture, fiat is in a bubble - look at the bond market and debt? Lets print more money
81 2018-01-08 23:55:41 These days sometimes when I go on the front page of @BittrexExchange I just have to laugh. Some of those top volume coins I find disturbing yet funny. Anyone else who feels like that?

92 2018-01-08 23:54:35 overhyped with 170 sats? Kidding me??
93 2018-01-08 23:54:28 No exchange closure. The devs supply locked in smart contract & can't touch them for four years. This is way longer than alot of these ICO's and dev teams (alot of them 6 months then they can sell or move) from other exchanges. It means the dev team is in it for the long run. 
94 2018-01-08 23:54:16 Thank you World Crypto Economic Conference for sponsoring conference Jan 15-16, 2018. Speaker list looks fantastic. Looking forward to learning a lot.  #WCEF

100 2018-01-08 23:53:52 @rabois question - what do you think is a good % of net worth that people who work in tech should have in crypto?
101 2018-01-08 23:53:48 When % of your net worth is in #cryptocurrency?  #bitcoin $crypto #altcoins
102 2018-01-08 23:53:40 Saying X is ‘cancer’ is both stupid and insensitive. 

I don’t care if you’re talking about a crypto-currency or Logan Paul.

One of the biggest problems in the world today is when people think they’re so ‘right’ that they have a free-pass to say anything.

108 2018-01-08 23:53:08 HitBTC is one of the worst exchanges for crypto currencies. This is not a professional start for Envion tokens. This lack of professionalism will damage the image of Envion significantly. So hurry up and make contracts with other exchanges, i.e. Bitfinex
109 2018-01-08 23:53:04 That's not what's being discussed. Maybe try joining a conversation, when you know what the topic is to start.

120 2018-01-08 23:51:57 any recommendations on other crypto exchanges for new users?
121 2018-01-08 23:51:57 Basically if you just combined tradingview and coin market cap you'd have the most used crypto resource on the internet. Could also expand to a forum.

138 2018-01-08 23:50:29 t's always easy to exit on the way up. It's the downside that will bankrupt you.  You have to admit you made a mistake and act on it.  The secret to staying in the game is having money.  Most people hope, and hope is a lousy strategy.
139 2018-01-08 23:50:16 Let's be honest, some people are chasing profit while some are chasing financial sovereignty. And if we're really honest, both groups are chasing profit. Whether through a revolutionized monetary system driven by crypto currency or whether it remains status quo/bank controlled.

154 2018-01-08 23:49:08 Like now?! 
155 2018-01-08 23:49:02 I think crypto currency mania is merely the precursor to the failure of poorly managed country economies and fiat money and the beginning of a new era where veteran shitposters and technology begin affecting the future of the new global economy
156 2018-01-08 23:49:02 $XVG CRUISE!!!!!

Caribbean cruise for 7 days would be AWESOME! I'd fly from Sydney, however there are also cruises from our port in Sydney to the South Pacific.. Vanuatu, new caledonia and Fiji! 10-12 nights all food and accommodation included in the price, just pay for alcohol!
157 2018-01-08 23:49:01 credit where credit's due 
158 2018-01-08 23:49:00 The crypto community needs to be nicer to new investors. 

Where do you think your gains are coming from? 

Stop calling the people who make you money noobs.

159 2018-01-08 23:48:56 You guys must be running out of tissues soon.
160 2018-01-08 23:48:51 I was thinking of taking a look at Banana coin today actually, it sounds ridiculous, but it will probably end up being huge LMAO
161 2018-01-08 23:48:42 Congratulations i am pleased for you
162 2018-01-08 23:48:41 I’m still trying to learn about all this, but won’t they just keep making/releasing new coins/crypto’s forever?
163 2018-01-08 23:48:39 Some people are very friendly and glad to help. Some people are so inundated with replies that they can't respond. But that's ok. Just find a friendly voice who is willing to help and you'll go far. And do your own research. DYOR
164 2018-01-08 23:48:38 I would add $MCO Monaco, they are developing their Crypto-based visa card and expand in 2018 (card distribution and such). Great team behind it.
165 2018-01-08 23:48:19 I would love to see $8K BTC. What an opportunity of a lifetime!
166 2018-01-08 23:48:13 $ZRX $FUN take a bow!
167 2018-01-08 23:48:12 first off banks are already in a partnership with ripple, they would shutdown any anti establishment crypto (bitcoin) before they take down anyone that is already with the establishment. have you been up to date with the news (china). $xrp isnt going away any time soon.
168 2018-01-08 23:48:11 @AlecTorelli  What are your qualifications to run/form a crypto channel?
169 2018-01-08 23:48:08 Awww, hahah, I'd be up for it tho ^^
170 2018-01-08 23:48:07 You should already know as an investor and you should already knlw how crypto works if you invest.  When they update code on their Github account it's shows the update on their twitter. It means they're working on improving code... duh...  it's not news it's an update.
171 2018-01-08 23:48:02 Trading volume on #PascalCoin looks promising. Worth taking note. #Crypto #altcoins #Bitcoin
172 2018-01-08 23:48:00 てかDOGEコイン1ヶ月前より6,7倍になっとるんか…
173 2018-01-08 23:47:57 Well if you want cold weather and a tattoo, come to Michigan. Grand Rapids is Beer City, USA. Also have long road distillery which won best gin in the world 2 years in a row. Weather is shit right now, just a heads up
174 2018-01-08 23:47:50 Water cooler talk has shifted from how was your weekend to holy shit what are potstocks and crypto currencies?
175 2018-01-08 23:47:48 public sale begins the 29th january and you will need an account for that
176 2018-01-08 23:47:45 Ahhhh $ZRX feels good. Feeling pretty good after that $BNB and $ZRX recently. 

Btw I have not sold and do not plan to sell a single coin of ZRX. Still got quite the opportunity ahead of it.
177 2018-01-08 23:47:37 Search the thread, answered that question with a chart already
178 2018-01-08 23:47:34 Would love to see some good programming on crypto currencies.... And the property bubble (less Kirsty Phill pls)
179 2018-01-08 23:47:34 #btc #bitcoin #altcoin #crypto #cryptocurrency #utilitycoin #blockchain #PAC #paccoin Not worth the waiting time for a quicky - most the people that own it don't even know about the March deadline, - it's a trade off of bagholders  - STAY AWAY until after March.  -
180 2018-01-08 23:47:33 But common sense would also say that, why would a bank pay Ripple for their premined coins, when they can just create their own crypto coins using the same technology? My thing is, banks are stupid. They're smart and selfish. Why pay someone for something they can figure out.
181 2018-01-08 23:47:24 @binance_2017 are you having problems with trades??  Mine hasn’t been corrected in 10hrs now n no correspondence through email either. Not a happy crypto guy at the moment
182 2018-01-08 23:47:18 I read about $UFR on ethtrader reddit and @crypt0snews spoke about it in one of his videos $RPX was Ian's recommendation. $POWR $DBC I found on a crypto facebook group, and got in both during the presale. Research is key, and that doesn't mean you need to be reading whitepapers.
183 2018-01-08 23:47:17 As a crypto investor, I find it amusing when I see a correction in crypto markets followed by a rapid rebound.. and then 4 hours later read about cryptos demise in mainstream media. Stop writing about stuff you don’t understand! #toolate #Crypto #bitcoin #ripple #btc #altcoins
184 2018-01-08 23:47:15 That's a good question. I would ask when to hold $BTC, when to enter $alts, when to sell back to $BTC, when to jump into $alts, what $alts to buy. Pleb-level stuff. Also got help on seeing the future possibilities of certain coins on a functional analysis (FA) level.
185 2018-01-08 23:47:08 #funfair #cryptocurrency #Crypto .... and here we go again funfair is off  love money
186 2018-01-08 23:46:53 Yeah exactly 1 coin is worth $0.5 at that weird stock exchange so that make no sense to sell them when we purchased them for $2. I have 500 as well. $20 that would be sick price :)
187 2018-01-08 23:46:45 You did it and I follow a time ago !!
188 2018-01-08 23:46:40 Now, its freaking cold and stuff but you should definitely look into Canada as well. We have most of the good stuff, almost none of the bad stuff.
189 2018-01-08 23:46:35 DO NOT go to E St Louis
190 2018-01-08 23:46:31 Plus tron is brand new... and I mean his road map is pretty much a 10 year + project, trx has had astronomical gains since a penny so he can tweet and stream away it's working, and 50% is nothing in crypto, it just screams buy
191 2018-01-08 23:46:14 Could you tell us when to cashout is well  I'm very new to crypto I leave everything on binance

208 2018-01-08 23:44:54 coinmarket cap isn't updated to relfect the real supply of 3m, @HeyRhett officially confirmed it
209 2018-01-08 23:44:48 MTL still a good entry point?
210 2018-01-08 23:44:47 #FunFair crypto looks promising. Works on online gaming with no transaction fees. Could increase to $2-3 within a few months. Just listed on #bitfinex and has a supply of 4billion. Already increased 500% in 2 weeks
211 2018-01-08 23:44:42 Why invest time into girls when I could invest in crypto
212 2018-01-08 23:44:39 U know what he's referring to right?
213 2018-01-08 23:44:38 What coins ya feel might hit coinbase
214 2018-01-08 23:44:36 Isn’t the point of crypto that you don’t need banks anymore? You’ve got to let go of fiat, bro.
215 2018-01-08 23:44:35 Texas has it all, nature and city and business and weirdos and everything in between. Also we are the most American Americans there are.
216 2018-01-08 23:44:33 Doesn't look good.
217 2018-01-08 23:44:31 My $WABI bags are getting bigger and bigger. People are starting to see the value in it. Still a long way to go until this coin is worth what it's supposed to. Up up up we go!

224 2018-01-08 23:43:51 the list goes on, please care to go against my comment. i'm somewhat well informed. i bet you're only saying bitcoin because of its price, not because of the software (blockchain) nowadays all these crypto are based off of blockchain. (2/2)
225 2018-01-08 23:43:47 yeah I  got myself some MTL too, can't ignore the low circ supply and low price with a good project. just don't like to hear stuff getting delisted just like that
226 2018-01-08 23:43:42 me
227 2018-01-08 23:43:40 If you hold $DRGN and have severely weak hands, please report to either me or @PowersCrypto. You can sell the dip to us.
228 2018-01-08 23:43:31 İt is not dead project. İt is dead to me because of big market cap. Did u try smaller cap dex ? Try first , comment later. Radarrelay for example. Wavesdex ( it is big too but so better)
229 2018-01-08 23:43:28 Yes, this is definitely a good start as all the casinos say to their customers
230 2018-01-08 23:43:25 Oh ok so I'll believe your screenshot that don't really make any sense. Nice try but the stability and price of this coin speaks for itself.

243 2018-01-08 23:42:20 No it's not. It's all about bitcoin/crypto, but within the crypto space the biggest ponzi since bernie madoff is brewing and not one big media outlet is noticing it. It's a hell of a story to write about.
244 2018-01-08 23:42:19 #SouthKorea language on #cryptocurrency seems to be lightening up. This comes after news of bank probes in coming days. Is there a future in South Korea for #Crypto
245 2018-01-08 23:42:17 Need. More. Principle. The good news is this as reignited my motivation to do even mundane things in life like working a terrible job. Anything to get more $ to dump into crypto.
246 2018-01-08 23:42:08 450$ de beneficio neto en 3 horas. Las crypto y su magia. ¡A por más! 
247 2018-01-08 23:41:53 I was told that adding "blockchain" to my handle would increase my mentions and views by a large margin but clearly I was lied to. I want my crypto back.

252 2018-01-08 23:41:35 What is the good news expected for today for Trx?
253 2018-01-08 23:41:34 Ik ben het helemaal eens met @AGrunbergAgency Het charme offensief vanuit Rusland neemt enge vormen aan. Er wordt aan de EU getrokken. In een spel met Amerika. @JinekLive
254 2018-01-08 23:41:33 coin market cap took out korean prices. hence the revaluation. korean crypto skewing everything up
255 2018-01-08 23:41:32 Maybe I should have phrased it; there's no obvious reason for this change in price, except the CMC/Ripple correction and subsequent panic reaction,  so as with any dip, now is a good time to accumulate.

But, hey this is crypto, so any predictions are to be taken with salt  
256 2018-01-08 23:41:27 Where do we sign
257 2018-01-08 23:41:24 @photofyapp Any Bitcoin / Crypto Currency quotes or images coming soon??

260 2018-01-08 23:41:14 Or you can just keep tweeting about each one you invest in complaining. Either one
261 2018-01-08 23:41:04 Awesome! $FUN was listed on @bitfinex. Still a massively undervalued coin with a working product. You can go ahead and try it yourself! After that you'll for sure wanna join the party

263 2018-01-08 23:41:02 Keep in mind when making investment decisions to DYOR. The #crypto game is one of probability. Look at all variables. Use math to determine how many people could use it. Look at #marketcaps and trends to find the price probability and potential. Play smart. Not with your heart.
264 2018-01-08 23:40:48 Do you want nature or city/party?
265 2018-01-08 23:40:43 oh boi, really want to see more red candles on the #XRP, it really needs a good correction.

268 2018-01-08 23:40:14 B3 on yobit is on the wrong chain. B3 forked a couple months ago but Yobit never updated their wallet. Coinechange sells the correct B3 but the coins will not be compatible with Yobit.
269 2018-01-08 23:40:07 You need to invest in the stock market if you can't handle the swings.
270 2018-01-08 23:40:06 Oof looks like you cost yourself >70% swing in the wrong direction...

278 2018-01-08 23:39:23 Bittrex never gives the details. At this point it doesn't really matter, I treat this as an opportunity to get one of the very few legit coins at the bottom
279 2018-01-08 23:39:15 That’s the kind of answer I like . I’m also here for the long run, I truly believe in this project. I am holding minimum 2-4 years on $KIN. Thanks for the advice !
280 2018-01-08 23:39:13 Nice try 
281 2018-01-08 23:39:07 Ha I'm going to hold bc I believe in trx. You are in the crypto market. There are going to be ups and downs all the time. I think most people jumping in this don't understand the swings and think this market is a get rich quick thing.
282 2018-01-08 23:38:58 I didn’t wanna annoy my friends so I made a new profile dedicated to crypto.

295 2018-01-08 23:37:52 i know little to nothing about crypto - can i still be an expert?

300 2018-01-08 23:37:28 Thoughts on Airtoken @crypto_rand ? Team looks good and the market cap is still very low. Seems like an under the radar gem in the making.
301 2018-01-08 23:37:23 @crypto_sarah9 are you really Justin sun pushing that trx crap> so far I am loosing on that junk lol
302 2018-01-08 23:37:19 Good chance to to get in on  #bitbean / #beancash.  Price under 200 satoshi / 0.03 $USD. This won't last long!

304 2018-01-08 23:37:18 I'm from Korea and the volume is real. If you walk down the street or go to a cafe you hear at least 4~5 people talking about crypto. Why are we excluded for being the biggest supporter of crypto?
305 2018-01-08 23:37:12 There is accounts for sale ... I’ve got one unused
306 2018-01-08 23:37:10 There are going to be so many ICOs this year. Jump on one you think will be powerful and get on board. I'm pumped.
307 2018-01-08 23:37:06 Are you guy going to update that website? Where I can read news about you?
308 2018-01-08 23:37:02 Use $lend you can get a lend there
309 2018-01-08 23:37:00 The adage goes that: 'A rising tide lifts all boats,' and the same goes  for a falling one. With Bitcoin still being the biggest boat in the bay,  it makes sense that should an issur affect it and its price, other  coins in the crypto market will also feel the effect. #Bitcoin

313 2018-01-08 23:36:48 Addendum

Diluted among crypto I mean. 

Interesting there happened to be "that thing" with coin market cap around same time so things are even less clear.

315 2018-01-08 23:36:35 He is also pointing in a penetrative manner which serves as a crypto-patriarchal signal of male supremacy, whilst simultaneously mansplaining, implying that women are directionless without men. Being made of plastic (a polluting male invention) it is toxic masculinity in toy form

319 2018-01-08 23:36:05 Hi, is there a language option in the application? It is not in English. How can we use it ?
320 2018-01-08 23:36:05 Bare man think they're some crypto currency guru. Bud you brought 1/1800th of some breddahs bit coin. My pal made his own currency and I'm waiting for the coins that are currently worth 0.0001p to grow. Let's say when they go to 0.1p I'll be rich 
321 2018-01-08 23:36:02 I was thinking of a month or something

325 2018-01-08 23:35:36 A very very wealthy/rich client of mine told me #Ripple is the only crypto company worth something becuz they aren't trying to compete with fiat,  theyre trying to solve a specific problem with cross border transfers.  What do you think?
326 2018-01-08 23:35:20 Good news for 2018... most respected crypto heads know this is a top 10
327 2018-01-08 23:35:19 This problem exists in any market , not just #crypto
328 2018-01-08 23:35:12 Isn't it amazing #XWIN cryptobet project has raised over $1,500,000 already in its ongoing #ico #cryptobet  for a project that provides investors the opportunity to be co-owners of the first crypto-bookmaker and receive 100% net income #XWIN #CryptoBet #tokensale #cryptocurrency
329 2018-01-08 23:34:46 So no retort? Seems about right.
330 2018-01-08 23:34:41 What’s going on with the crypto market? All of them seem to be down

337 2018-01-08 23:34:12 Put $10 into every crypto on #CoinMarketCap, that's roughly $13,750.  If only two coins made 1000x, then you'd be up 45%...
338 2018-01-08 23:34:11 If Bitcoin soft fork actually gave us the 2MB upgrade which had consensus. We wouldn't have to call segwit 1MB coin Bitcoin.
339 2018-01-08 23:34:07 I believe you
340 2018-01-08 23:34:06 Telegram's muti-billion dollar ICO is stupendous. Add to that Facebook's consideration of crypto coins. A techtonic rethink on crypto currencies for every entrepreneur (and VC).
341 2018-01-08 23:33:59 A friend of mine did a wraith protocol transaction, on exchange they had a message that he simply has received crypto - no address, no IP attached, transaction under 3 mins - take in notice its to a small Exch. with longer confirmal times
342 2018-01-08 23:33:59 How many stories have we read where a #crypto investor made 1000x on their money?
343 2018-01-08 23:33:57 Btw crypto isnt a currency. Its just a messenger where ppl can send funds to each other. Anonymously. Wo banks states and swift! Without fees like at western union. Thats what is screwing the establishment and their bullshit ponzi scheme not bcuz they worrz bout your invests
344 2018-01-08 23:33:55 I filled my bags the other day, hope you're right @crypto_bobby  but you know, got to think dumb to get rich these days

352 2018-01-08 23:33:26 Bcash is the most disruptive force in the crypto space. Roger Ver is a snake oil salesman and we all want to see Litecoin over taking that shit coin this year. Do your best Satoshilite

355 2018-01-08 23:33:17 Ok cool man!! I’ll check it out :-) very good insight! Have you used binance yet? Is the process of transferring coins from Coinbase to kucoin the same process? Also is there a iOS app for kucoin

363 2018-01-08 23:32:55 Crypto isn’t yet a tool for people because it has no adoption. It’s a speculative asset currently that people get into for gains, not utility. That’s what market cap currently measures, for eth as well as ripple as well as anything else. My 50c.

368 2018-01-08 23:32:38 They had just released the news that there will be no public sale. The coins will be obtainable in a kind of reward system.

No info so far as to what other "reward events" they are planning.

370 2018-01-08 23:32:30 At the moment Crypto 'currency' are an excellent way to hide your transactions and bypass normal channels, avoid the law & taxes. Period. They are not money in any sense of the word and yes closer to bartering. Yes not controlled yet...that will change.
371 2018-01-08 23:32:15 *$1 million is NOT what it used to be. $2 to 3 Trillion Dollars worth of Global Currency Sitting Idle in Banks, Lost, Directionless & Inflated in Value Makes All Be Wonder About Crypto Currencies. #WhatIsTheValueOfTraditonalCurrencies #WhatDoesIcelandProve?

380 2018-01-08 23:31:47 Is the crypto community at large a bunch of push overs? Is this why #TrumpTaxScam  and @CoinMarketCap can literally attack the viability of our industry with no answer?

387 2018-01-08 23:31:10 But seriously, what crypto do I all-in so I never have to work again and can just spend all my time racing
388 2018-01-08 23:31:09 for whom have you made complaints ??? and the price is still high - just like everyone already knows that btc is not anonymous
389 2018-01-08 23:31:09 it's all just lemming effect.. spook, wait for all the little guys to jump then buy in when the heard scatters. It's always interesting to watch, this one even more so. Based on NewsLTD reporting I wonder how much crypto Emperor Murdoch has at the moment ?
390 2018-01-08 23:31:08 I'll play, I'll even donate .5 to a friend who isn't on crypto to get them started.

419 2018-01-08 23:29:12 You're right, it's not the same as Ripple. Because Ripple locks their supply up in Escrow & can't physically sell it. The supply they sell, they sell to market makers or institutions who sign agreements to only be able to sell a small % of daily volume. Much more protection IMO
420 2018-01-08 23:29:09 I'm a sophomore in college and I first learned about bitcoin my freshman year of high school. People think crypto currency is new??

432 2018-01-08 23:28:06 If you call a half finished wallet, with no official download link on their site or announcement as, 'already out'. Then sure it's out. Though downloading it from github is hardly appealing to the masses and the QT 4.0 wallet, was 'released', missing a lot of key features.

437 2018-01-08 23:27:19 In the world of crypto people tend to underestimate downside risks routinely. That to me is unfortunate as many will lose money on a one-time event. When it comes to Sweetbridge asset diversification and physical asset collateral are long-term strategies for risk mitigation.
438 2018-01-08 23:27:18 En fait c'est visiblement du au déréférencement de tous les marchés coréen (KRW) par coinmarketcap, ce qui à fait instantanément distraire pas mal de milliards de market cap et ça a suivi par un panic sell sûrement. C'était juste un bon moment pour racheter de la crypto en fait.

454 2018-01-08 23:26:13 if you look at @taviso's original tweet, you'll see crypto people asking if he'll glance at their projects too, which is the right answer :-) that silly thread was the only really terrible response
455 2018-01-08 23:26:13 Brave is a browser that blocks ads and trackers by default. It also prevents attempts to digitally fingerprint users, and stops nasty web-based crypto-miners from stealing your CPU power. It also integrates the $BAT as a means to support content creators via an attention ledger.

492 2018-01-08 23:23:11 Exchanges buy up coins/tokens before they get listed to add to the sell side to make a market. As for pumps, it could be insiders of the coin/token pumping it
493 2018-01-08 23:23:10 良かったです。　取引所再開は公式で12時間前にアナウンスされるとの事なので、フォローされると確実かと思います

494 2018-01-08 23:23:08 This guy have no insight. He's using our likeness of him which eventually made him popular. 
Although he pump coins to an extent no doubt. But we should not discourage other investors money they invested in crypto by blindly following the coin he mention here. It disrupt system.
495 2018-01-08 23:23:08 #Bitcoin prices drop as China is trying to shut down Bitcoin mining. For people new to #Crypto news like this happens all the time. I can't tell you how many times I've seen China say they are banning Bitcoin. This might be a good time for miners to switch to other coins. $BTC
496 2018-01-08 23:23:06 Moderators always earn more than others. They buy before everyone (10 sec enough) and they sell before everyone. It is just a shit trap. Dont enter any pump groups.
497 2018-01-08 23:23:05 I hope you’re right. I need to find myself a crypto babe

503 2018-01-08 23:22:45 Have fun thinking some grand change is right around the corner. It's not. When people and businesses see they can lose money b/c crypto is so volatile they will back out and it will all come crashing down.

509 2018-01-08 23:22:16 Been doing research into new Alt-Coins and came across Rimbit $RBT. It’s backed by solid tech and I definitely see some good upside to it. It’s a 4 year old coin that is the only coin that has been fully distributed...the only coin that is owned solely by the crypto community...

520 2018-01-08 23:21:26 not sure about the numbers. satoshis address holds one million btc which is 6%. We can assume he's dead, if not he could dump on his invention I suppose. rogerv just tried a dump not too long ago. It failed. But there is an issue of concentration, yes. Its not the same as ripple
521 2018-01-08 23:21:21 Looks good, need to read into this!
522 2018-01-08 23:21:19 The good news about newbies investing in #shitcoins and scams who delusionaly believe it will be the next #Bitcoin:

1) They will learn about the technology and decentralization (though the hard way)

2) Money invested in crypto stays in crypto (eventually #BTC)
523 2018-01-08 23:21:19 Remember crypto principles:
Borderless
Trustless
Censor resistant
Without government interference. Governments CAN over regulate, shutdown, and, seize Coinbase at will.
524 2018-01-08 23:21:17 There is no way to win. And after all they won't tell you who is winner. So where is the prize? :))

528 2018-01-08 23:21:03 So it has been a terrible day for crypto 

And from what I can gather for no real reason 

Does this show the power of speculation in the crypto world and why some coins are massively overpriced 

Speculation is the reason for the pumps and the reason it's such fun to trade on
529 2018-01-08 23:20:56 While I can't disagree about banks crypto is a lost cause. The majority of people will never adopt it until some major paradigm change occurs and by then you and I will be dead and normal investments will still be the most secure and stable.
530 2018-01-08 23:20:48 Bought it up towards end of last year. After some research I felt it had a lot going for it in 2018 with the low price and fundamentals...
531 2018-01-08 23:20:44 The money went into crypto
532 2018-01-08 23:20:33 If you're in doubt Google Brendan Eich (the founder). Not some kid coding in his basement, but the creator of JAVASCRIPT no less (among other things). Few other crypto projects have such high-profile figures behind them.

542 2018-01-08 23:19:41 Oh, we get it. The gold rush of late 1840's led to the nickname for those fortune-seekers "miner 49ers," and you expect the GPU manufacturers, who make the equipment crypto currency miners use, to capitalize on this by supporting the team named after the more historic versions.

546 2018-01-08 23:19:31 qlc i bought at crowdsale but also presale with 1 month lock , those wil lbe unlocked later. Many presale you can get a lock of 1 month or longer. Thats why presale is longer locked but for example more discount, can differs for each ico.

563 2018-01-08 23:18:02 I really think this would stand out. You could even put this as a paid feature: everyone trading crypto needs this. Cashtags are useless without being able to filter the spambots. Example: $xrb
564 2018-01-08 23:18:01 Many crypto pundits have stated AChain can reach $2B within two months. As things are so crazy right now, this probably means $2B within 3 weeks.

572 2018-01-08 23:17:29 Not 100% sure about AI but yes by tethering a load of computers together does give you more computing power and should give you enough power to mine crypto coin depending on which coin you want to mine.  But still requires a lot of power to produce one coin.

581 2018-01-08 23:16:56 Crypto market is down around $1b today so tbh not a bad time to get in.
582 2018-01-08 23:16:54 Crypto people are weird and cringey
583 2018-01-08 23:16:52 They released coin in 2014, but it never took off, then in May suddenly there’s hype about crypto and they decide to do their website, it’s a pump and dump coin, you can tell that by the massive sell wall...not even John Snow could climb that thing
584 2018-01-08 23:16:51 Gotcha. I'll be in the crypto stuff by eow. all profits from equity market this week are going to be used for crypto.
585 2018-01-08 23:16:50 @CNBCFastMoney Gimme a break Brian Kelly and Crypto ETFs? NOW, where was he 10,000 points ago on $BTC. Not to mention he cannot trade stock profitably to save his life. So now that he's on the OSTK board he'll probably load up his ETF with worthless $OSTK coins
586 2018-01-08 23:16:43 ahhhh!!!! do not have enough of this!!!!
587 2018-01-08 23:16:33 Let’s hope the one I’m talking to is the legit one lol

589 2018-01-08 23:16:21 You can pay whatever fees you think are fair for your transactions...
590 2018-01-08 23:16:21 If you have anything crypto related in your username or profile/header picture and need to ask where to buy a coin please delete yourself. @CoinMarketCap under markets, it's not that hard!
591 2018-01-08 23:16:20 Apparently you already found them bra they on your arm
592 2018-01-08 23:16:17 Either invest or look for something else to look at why don't you look into the coin that everyone is talking about $Ripple look at there whitepaper . $TRX #Tron will be a great product give it time like all other crypto.

594 2018-01-08 23:16:11 韓国ではないけど、bitbankも他取引所と比較して全体的に仮想通貨の値段が高くなってます。これは裁定取引による価格是正よりも資金流入の方が上回り、仮想通貨の数(特に基軸通貨となるBTC)が足りてないことによると思われます。

I have a little recommendation. Learn how to read charts, don't follow blindly, and set your stops.

690 2018-01-08 23:09:00 HEY YOU, SAYING YOUR GONNA INVEST IN CRYPTO WHEN YOUR PAYCHECK COMES THRU THIS WEEK, GO BUY SOME RIPPLE NIGGA
691 2018-01-08 23:08:59 I just can't stop. If Ripple is better than any block-chain, then so is #Nginx, they can process 10,000 transactions per second on one instance ;) For that matter, so is any centralized web server. #backtoreality

714 2018-01-08 23:07:49 Nope...money is an institution that has certain attributes that fwd contract+ underlying lack: consensus as a unit of measure (cryptos lack it too), redeemability (still to be tested in a future crypto crisis), fungibility (cryptos lack it too).

721 2018-01-08 23:07:40 Well a lot of poeple in crypto are more the " the big bang theory" -guys so having a lot of money would eventually help them get the last point of your list  see the problem?
722 2018-01-08 23:07:39 This guy is last person you should ask. Your cat has better insight into crypto
723 2018-01-08 23:07:38 $DBIX
724 2018-01-08 23:07:33 Be nice if it was actually #decentralized, too. Not complaining. I like #Ripple It is, however, complete bullshit when they say "better than any blockchain" but aren't even decentralized, tricking users into thinking their tech is better, when it's really just a #tradeoff.
725 2018-01-08 23:07:23 No one from the official verge group said there was gonna be an announcement
726 2018-01-08 23:07:22 
727 2018-01-08 23:07:14 That would be cool but then thousands of people will lose their money and I think it's not something that would be like Satoshi
728 2018-01-08 23:06:51 I'm willing to bet, that given the monetary value of investment, there's no greater return to one's happiness than with the $0.99 one can spend on a box of Mac and Cheese. #MarketSpeculation #Bitcoin #Crypto
729 2018-01-08 23:06:51 I agree with @KIN_KING_CRYPTO
730 2018-01-08 23:06:50 i'd say so
731 2018-01-08 23:06:38 I am, I always stock up on more crypto when it's low. I just don't like it when the crypto noobs think they know everything. I see it everywhere.
732 2018-01-08 23:06:35 the disciplines of Crypto
733 2018-01-08 23:06:33 So basically we are going to see Blockchain, crypto currency,  and foldable used about 6M times. #CES

736 2018-01-08 23:06:18 Yeah, but I have patience. Maybe I'll give them few more days. Looks like they have backlog with this and proceed it slowly. I can understand, so many new customers. Not going to spread FUD, not yet at least :)
737 2018-01-08 23:06:16 Thats it, turning on notifications! #teamrand
738 2018-01-08 23:06:15 Long ZRX...
739 2018-01-08 23:06:14 HODL your $ZRX bags, ATH incoming. 
740 2018-01-08 23:06:12 Yes! Always do your OWN research as much as possible before venturing to the unknown. Double Check, Triple Check!! Feel comfortable before you make any move with cryptocurrency. But yes, your good!
741 2018-01-08 23:06:11 I like your new profile picture by the way ... it kind of changed the voice i hear when i read your tweets now haha $ZRX 
742 2018-01-08 23:06:10 What do you expect for $TRST mainnet will be launch on january 18th
743 2018-01-08 23:06:09 Me: Crypto coin is so stupid. Based off nothing. They all do the same thing.. It's all going to crash. 

Also me: which coin is the move though??
744 2018-01-08 23:06:08 Did you just dump on Binance? ...lol
745 2018-01-08 23:06:02 absolutely ridiculous, there is no way this delayed announcement isn’t don’t on purpose, see it far too often in the crypto space
746 2018-01-08 23:06:02 What gets me excited: "Interest is rightfully high in Ethereum regarding the potential use of zk-SNARKs within zapps, and there is likely some crossover of ideas and development which will benefit both ecosystems."
747 2018-01-08 23:06:02 USDT_ETH price DECREASED to $1097.000000 on #poloniex. New alerts (+/- 4.000 pct) set at: UP: $1140.880000 - DOWN: $1053.120000 $eth #eth #ethereum #crypto $crypto $btc

753 2018-01-08 23:05:52 All I want is to get ONE SINGLE 1080 ti Graphics Card... Could all the Crypto miners ease up on buying all possible cards out? Every site is "Sold Out" and getting a notification of "In stock" only for it to be gone within the hour just isn't cool...
754 2018-01-08 23:05:52 Attending the @CoinAgenda Summit in Las Vegas. Lots of talk about improved governance and the value of experience in #crypto – bij Caesars Palace Hotel & Casino
755 2018-01-08 23:05:52 It should. Shouldn't it?
756 2018-01-08 23:05:47 The level of ignorance with regard to world history and the financial systems that have Enslaved the masses for thousands of years is abundantly clear with comments such as yours. Please study your history.  You should listen to the creature from Jekyll Island, but I know u won't
757 2018-01-08 23:05:44 I am - unpaid! Its the most exciting crypto for me, which is why I decided to dedicate my Twitter account to it 
758 2018-01-08 23:05:33 What book or othet resource would you recommend to learn more about this subject? Thank you in advance
759 2018-01-08 23:05:26 Why's @CoinMarketCap, which focuses on global aggregate pricing of #crypto, excluding markets with outlier pricing like #Ripple /KRW? Especially when they make up a HUGE volume of the currency.
760 2018-01-08 23:05:19 Wow.  They made it like buying drugs.  Drugs are bad for you,  but crypto is a choice.  We must get decentralized internet....
761 2018-01-08 23:05:19 Crypto - the stakes of Rail Heaven with 200NL villains from 2007. This is for sure gonna end well.
762 2018-01-08 23:05:18 @GabbbarSingh can you suggest good crypto exchange in/for India? @coindelta_ has stopped registrations. So many negative reviews abt @koinexindia and @zebpay
763 2018-01-08 23:05:18 Also interesting to see PacCoin has the buy wall back at 1 sat and is now testing the 2 sat sell wall (all on cryptopia). It will break it, just a matter of time. Be patient and you'll be greatly rewarded $PAC #crypto #cryptocurrency

769 2018-01-08 23:04:50 I like this "4th Age of Man" idea. Makes crypto into a Elvish Middle Earth religion instead of a mad cash grab. 

Elvish cash grab.
770 2018-01-08 23:04:43 A massive slowdown in prices would slow trading volume. Crypto ETFs will give market access to the masses removing the need for direct trades.

778 2018-01-08 23:04:04 Yeah I jumped on that trade with you. Thanks matey. When it goes 2x, dm me and ill send you a tip.
779 2018-01-08 23:03:57 It is absolutely mania. When holiday dinner conversations are centered around "crypto" you know we've hit the black ice. I'd rather see these two respected exchanges lead the way than some unknown, less reliable entities. I really think you will see viability of it all near term.

787 2018-01-08 23:03:35 I assumed that a Satoshi could be a useful unit of currency that people can use when 1 BTC is worth 100,000,000 dollars. 1 Sat being a handy replacement for 1 cent. 
788 2018-01-08 23:03:34 It’s a mess. Unacceptable way of doing business if you ask me.
789 2018-01-08 23:03:33 Appreciate it man!
790 2018-01-08 23:03:32 I'll try to catch the next one... all my cryptomoney curently tied up in #ZCL
791 2018-01-08 23:03:31 well you should contact support then.
792 2018-01-08 23:03:29 That's why it will fall. Or, worst case scenario, BTC crashes BCC crashes and the whole crypto community goes to shit. At which point it's no longer profitable to operate and they pull out. All of that is business. Not ponzi/scam/pyramid schemes. Business
793 2018-01-08 23:03:29 How can CB add them. When they're goal is to kill CB
794 2018-01-08 23:03:23 Back up your hard drive and crypto information and bury the backup in a led container.
795 2018-01-08 23:03:21 Plenty of time for buyers to accumulate too. This was inevitable

797 2018-01-08 23:03:15 Goodluck everyone! 5000 $XVG could be life changing!
798 2018-01-08 23:03:09 Xrp was the best performing digital asset of 2017. Btc gains = 1,600% ....XRP gains = 37,000 %.  News flash this isnt a healthy pullback for BTC its the beggining of the end.
799 2018-01-08 23:03:05 Balls deep, I tell you! Still in Thailand? 
800 2018-01-08 23:03:00 She was against trx. I can remember the posts. Now trx is hyped and "she" is promoting trx.
801 2018-01-08 23:02:58 Why is crypto so much more expensive in Korea?  
is it true there are currency controls that prevent arbitrage? 

If there was a Nigerian prince scam that claimed to do a Korea crypto arbitrage, i bet it would make $$$ 
[not legal advice]

803 2018-01-08 23:02:56 Awesome, man. Had a simillar idea once but never made it true. Maybe even start a donation wallet for your class so that we (the crypto community) can donate some coins for paper wallets. Stuff like that.. Wish you all the best.
804 2018-01-08 23:02:52 I like it when you say "bang bang". Please shill us more gems so we can haz more bang bang.

816 2018-01-08 23:02:22 1/ I remember being in $crypto 6 months and being ecstatic with x3 in $usd. Found out I was -3x in $btc. Then I followed these people and now I'm at a $btc ATH and up x16.8 in $usd in 2 months. Thanks

835 2018-01-08 23:01:05 Because nothing lasts forever. This whole crypto realm is the wild wild west. Due to a lack of regulation, things like Bitconnect can thrive. But it challenges the base institutional financing mechanisms. Governments won't allow that for long.

869 2018-01-08 22:59:04 OK, this cryptonoob has finally decided, after two weeks of wavering and research - If you want to put everything on a crypto-horse that might pull through NOW, but ride on even if she fails... For me it's $AMB, $REQ, and $BNB, at least till spring.

877 2018-01-08 22:58:25 Shitcoin is a loose term at this stage of the game... I like to just ride all the waves I can, don’t really discriminate (much).  I was just saying if you question anyone drinking from the fountain of Tron-Koolaide be prepared.  Like jumping in a shark tank with a fresh wound.

885 2018-01-08 22:58:01 I'll never be rich from crypto currencies.. I'll always have to keep my job..

Verge will go up, and fast

The best explanation I’ve ever heard and one of the most fascinating 1A episodes I’ve heard. Thanks SO much for this conversation and to your guests today!
895 2018-01-08 22:56:57 on iPhone, put voice memos on your control panel. So just swipe up and it’s there. Eliminates one step at least.
896 2018-01-08 22:56:51 I bought at $0.01, $0.02, and $0.03 and not even thinking twice about it :) Reddcoin is a great coin with a great future in font of it!

898 2018-01-08 22:56:50 The fuckas who are crying over the legality of crypto are mad they didn’t get in a year ago and now try to ruin the party for everyone else :) good luck sucka im HODLING until ya momma comes home

900 2018-01-08 22:56:43 Unconfirmed Intel report suggests that deep state operatives disguised as UN soldiers may detonate EMP devices in key locations to destroy crypto currencies, and false flag it as an enemy attack.
901 2018-01-08 22:56:38 No joke, they just apparently have a different definition for it.

908 2018-01-08 22:56:31 I had a friend put 5$ on litecoin and is happy with his returns! You can't lead a horse sometimes lol
909 2018-01-08 22:56:30 UKG IS NEXT CRYPTO TO BLOW UP! WATCH FOR A PUMP TONIGHT AFTER THE KOREAN MARKET IS AWAKE! #markcuban where ya at??? UKG to the moon
910 2018-01-08 22:56:25 Korean exchanges account for c45% of #XRP volume and 30% price premium compared to 5% for #eth or #<1% for #btc and they said this skewed the numbers so took them out. they didn’t tell anyone and the whole market dumped  thinking the crypto market cap had dumped by over 100bn.
911 2018-01-08 22:56:24 @jaltucher you going to the crypto meetup tonite at the 40/40 club?

917 2018-01-08 22:55:54 2 announcements ????
918 2018-01-08 22:55:52 Fiat poor, crypto rich.
919 2018-01-08 22:55:45 New account, fresh starts. Why? To have an account dedicated to crypto entirely. 2018 = no excuses, get it done and reward yourself later. 
920 2018-01-08 22:55:43 Got some WABI Ethos and XRp. Market is down a bit today but we shall see. Worried about some of these SEC things though.
921 2018-01-08 22:55:38 I personally don't think you are doing it wrong as long as you buy decent alts. This accumulating of btc is something all the big crypto accounts tell you to do, but if you are going up in dollars by buying decent alts, it's fine.
922 2018-01-08 22:55:29 not pumpin is a normal up , if it a pump you see stratis in 150$ but is a normal up and target 2 is 200k=32$
923 2018-01-08 22:55:24 #ripple #xrp was created to destroy CRYPTO CURRENCY
924 2018-01-08 22:55:23 It’s okay you will get there my crypto friend.
925 2018-01-08 22:55:22 Quit my 9-5 job and never look back and trading Crypto full time. @DiaryofaMadeMan 
926 2018-01-08 22:55:05 Impressive!!! Bold/smart move! Just out curiosity. Did you diversify? Its because I started with only BTC a couple of months and I'm a big fan of TRX now so moved half but the big question is of course how long would it take to go to $1. Congrats in advance!
927 2018-01-08 22:55:03 With addition of private transactions* what is the future? Auto correct..
928 2018-01-08 22:54:56 Goddamnit I didn't mean Physicist and shit should like the tweet. Fucking literal ass motherfuckers

931 2018-01-08 22:54:40 LOL ... good luck buddy! ... f$%k it, it's only a car ... besides, it depreciates in value, drinks petrol AND bad for the environment :) ... CAR -> FIAT -> CRYPTO -> #TeslaModel3 $xvg
932 2018-01-08 22:54:35 Great learning to go back over your charting history of this thanks
933 2018-01-08 22:54:32 A
934 2018-01-08 22:54:27 I believe futures volum are very low and therefore have little impact on the price. + valuation on total crypto is so high, I can only see money from alts going to BTC. What do you think? Thanks for sharing your opinion
935 2018-01-08 22:54:25 LOL "Go all in every time balls deep, just get 20% per trade"
936 2018-01-08 22:54:24 Can't believe people actually think this is red whale. With broken English and knowing how passionate he is about reddcoin.
937 2018-01-08 22:54:19 I subscribed to James Altucher Crypto advice, everything seem outdated, what's the story here James ?? Where is my professional advice u promised ???

957 2018-01-08 22:53:07 Fair but if you get time, check out crypto. There’ll be a crash at some point but before then the returns are A1

961 2018-01-08 22:52:50 Hi John, can I come over from London to be your apprentice in learning about crypto currency. I promise to spend any profit I make on hookers, porn and drugs. I mean, I do all that now, except I have no profit at the moment and it’s killing me financially. And probably STD wise.
962 2018-01-08 22:52:49 Here comes that Tuesday Crypto revival

965 2018-01-08 22:52:37 2018 is the year of #crypto and #ico crazy to think we are involved in a revolution on all fronts
966 2018-01-08 22:52:37 This is not the stock market, this is crypto. The blockchain. A new technology. And man, we are not even close to a bubble. Don’t get scared when people claim it to be one. Be proud to be an early adopter!

969 2018-01-08 22:52:29 Me thinks $ETC and $ZEC should be pumping much harder, in comparison to the crap that's risen. But they're not the flashy "next Bitcoin/Ethereum" that noobs love... accumulation time?
970 2018-01-08 22:52:28 Ooh wee when that crypto kick in tho

974 2018-01-08 22:52:10 You forget that tron is an application and xrp has an own blockchain
975 2018-01-08 22:52:09 They have strong partnerships. I plan on doing more research as they near exchanges. I have heard good things but haven't done enough due diligence to recommend it.

979 2018-01-08 22:51:56 Good time to buy Tron right now, down nearly 50% from its all time high. I think it still has lots of room to grow. Loads of FUD about it at the moment, white paper criticism etc, that's irrelevant if they get Crypto puppies & Alibaba partnership. Price could be $0.50 by year end
980 2018-01-08 22:51:55 "Doesn't necessarily need to be physical to be backed up" crypto isn't physical... with seamless transactions eventually crypto will have an actual value not just a USD value, that's what it was created for in the first place...

1) Google settles
2) I write books that MRAs and the alt-right eats up
3) I invest in crypto and cash out
4) Profit!
983 2018-01-08 22:51:51 $ZRX still on of my most bullish positions. One of the most positive and exciting projects in the #crypto space.
984 2018-01-08 22:51:49 1) make a crypto coin where reputation correlates to holdings
2) ?????????
2.a) tweet "HODL $SOCoin" every 1 to 15 mins

989 2018-01-08 22:51:24 This is a game of speculation. The news with #xrp is there is news coming. And my reason for interest in #FunFair is due to the business they are in. The gaming community is huge! Just look at the crypto world, it's not too much different than a game of roulette!
990 2018-01-08 22:51:23 Why not? 90% of the people in crypto do it... seems that way at least lol
991 2018-01-08 22:51:20 Thank you for the insight. I will definitely check them out.
992 2018-01-08 22:51:17 Didn't say what you wanted to hear so you put on your earmuffs huh? This is why it's so easy to win big on crypto right now. I'll be sad when the institutional investors get in and we can't profit off these irrational investors.
993 2018-01-08 22:51:12 The first thing I did in $alts was ask a lot of questions. Some people with very generous souls helped me navigate the seas - and still do. (You know who you are.) This is an amazing adventure.

Take strong positions. Strong AF. Then Hold.

1020 2018-01-08 22:49:33 Lovin it
1021 2018-01-08 22:49:27 + I'm over here minding my business getting paid a few racks to do UI for some Ethereum app. I DONT EVEN REALLY KNOW WHAT IT IS but whatever. lmfao. bitcoin. crypto. blah blah blah.
1022 2018-01-08 22:49:25 I’ve lost so much money on crypto, just going to sell my verified binance account to break 0 profit ( .09 btc ) DM ME
1023 2018-01-08 22:49:24 Ripple is a bubble. Centralization exact opposite. Crypto does not need banks.
1024 2018-01-08 22:49:23 @noamlevenson have you looked at @Zilliqa yet? I’d love to hear your thoughts.
1025 2018-01-08 22:49:19 Anyone wanna explain to me how crypto currency works cause I’m jobless for another month or so

1027 2018-01-08 22:49:18 500 would be beautiful <3
1028 2018-01-08 22:49:16 Crypto people: We are building a world where there is no central authority.
CoinMarketCap: We are moving some numbers around.
Crypto people: Omg everything is red on CoinMarketCap! Sell!
1029 2018-01-08 22:49:12 I agree.  I think we are at bottom after pump though.
1030 2018-01-08 22:49:01 Bro tbh the more I learn crypto the less I like investing in anything that's known. Like honestly I've made more money off trading shitcoins than anything else. Anything top 100 in market cap is a no no for me now
1031 2018-01-08 22:48:58 CMC #marketmanipulation at work.
1032 2018-01-08 22:48:57 Check out @gems. That's the purpose of the evolution. Crypto is not about making money in usd or just become richer. Look for the projects that actually have a use for the good.. Contribute to make us better.
1033 2018-01-08 22:48:54 Tip: If you owe tax on crypto trades (or mining, or forks, or airdrops...) for 2017, cash out some $BTC (or anything, really) to pay for it. The government will not give you a refund on your 2017 capital gains or income taxes if crypto has a meltdown in 2018.

1045 2018-01-08 22:48:06 Five days in #Crypto is a long time, you can double or even triple your profits in the same time and then go all in with $TRX if you want, I've learned to be nimble with my moving of coins...
1046 2018-01-08 22:48:06 That sounds really cool. hahah Will do :)
1047 2018-01-08 22:47:57 Is it not a good idea crypto CEO’s to hire educated spokespeople to represent there brands to relay the messages in a way that will communicate more universal on the live streams & social media. I’ve noticed many of the CEO’s are bad public speakers and pretty socially awkward
1048 2018-01-08 22:47:55 Yeah buddy send Some sweet #XVG this way!
1049 2018-01-08 22:47:51 Biggest Mistake I made in Crypto was buying many Gems for Cheap and Sold them at a loss due to $BTC Run in Nov. Here are the 1st Gems I held and Sold :( $SMART $MOD $ARDR $ZEC $ZEN.  Look at em now! But humbled to remain up. Lesson Learned.

1053 2018-01-08 22:47:33 Good Luck

1055 2018-01-08 22:47:26 We are truly witnessing large changes in our traditional world. Anyone who thinks crypto is a fad is asleep. Further, anyone who doesn't see Ripple's role in bridging the traditional world with the future world is blind (or in denial).
1056 2018-01-08 22:47:18 Just wondering: how many crypto hodlers never heard of Mt Gox? Found 2 so far.
1057 2018-01-08 22:47:14 Yeah, I'll be hodling! The account is back up as well. Will be keeping an eye on this just in case.
1058 2018-01-08 22:47:14 Look at xvg twitter page thats where u should only get info from. They said news monday but didnt set a time

1083 2018-01-08 22:45:19 Well Google backed Ripple a couple years back, but nothing ever cane of it.  Amazon isn't getting into crypto at all in the foreseeable future due to the volatility, but rumors abound nonetheless.  Regardless, XRP has more upside ahead.
1084 2018-01-08 22:45:15 TAXES! Seriously, there was a big change to US tax laws that just went into effect that pretty much targets crypto traders. A video on how to properly manage crypto earnings under the new laws would be really helpful for a lot of people.
1085 2018-01-08 22:45:15 And That's just me having messed with it for awhile and having been around crypto for about 5 years now.

1142 2018-01-08 22:41:11 It depends on the coin the problem is that if the coin pumps they do t adjust it so your left with a huge fee. As a crypto influencer, I have directed my peeps to steer clear of this exchange.

1148 2018-01-08 22:40:37 okay break it down further:  Top 4% own 96.5% of all Bitcoins - and this doesn't account for single wealthy individuals having multiple addresses (which is likely for security reasons) 

said another way, 96% of people only own 3.5% of Bitcoins

you trust the top 4% not to dump?

1156 2018-01-08 22:39:34 Just my speculation! Coinburn and mainnet are pretty big in crypto. $trx seems to be always partnering up with big companies as well, I can see #tron at $2+ by 31st March. That’s 15x from today’s price! Overall $trx is  a great long term coin 

This is not financial advice!

1158 2018-01-08 22:39:26 I’m not sure what Bitcoin can do that no other crypto could do...?  Does it hold a patent or is there a barrier to entry to compete with it?  Outside of “familiarity” what does it posses that conquers other cryptos?

1162 2018-01-08 22:39:16 It's no surprise this guy supports bcash...you already have the worst people in the crypto community pushing BCH (Ver/Jihan/FakeSatoshi) lol
1163 2018-01-08 22:39:10 The underlying instruments traded change, human behavioral patterns don't.

It's not crypto that is of concern, it's that some crypto providers cater for people who want to get rich quick w/out possessing skill, mindset, risk mgmt required to make it sustainable for the long haul
1164 2018-01-08 22:39:05 こんなに急激にbitcoinが暴騰すると，売り買いしないでじっと持っておくのが無難。

1199 2018-01-08 22:36:46 Crypto is an ever evolving field and cardano looks to be well suited to the coming technological evolutions in the field.
1200 2018-01-08 22:36:42 SHIT!!!! I forgot to take a screenshot but I picked up more $VIA. When everything was up 30%+ $VIA was -0.8%, obvious accumulation. Now its starting to run.
1201 2018-01-08 22:36:34 Yes im sure. Just look at the recent tweets and the communication he does with the followers. And all of a sudden this without proof and or explanation. Come on guys we know better.
1202 2018-01-08 22:36:30 Days like today, in the crypto world, really suck. 
1203 2018-01-08 22:36:24 doesnt change the fact that it is out though
1204 2018-01-08 22:36:17 If I made my own crypto-coin it would be called “ bubble bubble” for the “bubble bubble bubble scare”, “housing” or “dot-com” “tulip mania”
1205 2018-01-08 22:35:58 LOL
1206 2018-01-08 22:35:52 I just went on his twitter and those tweets where now deleted so he must of saw someone hacked him and removed those tweets :)
1207 2018-01-08 22:35:49 Crypto currency is literally the future y all better catch up fr
1208 2018-01-08 22:35:47 Seems the account is gone. Not sure what to think of it.
1209 2018-01-08 22:35:47 .@YankeeFx I love crypto, I love P2P distributed ledger tech. I love fast & efficient transactions / reward system, most of all I love to take a profit. #Ripple has taken strides this past period Big money flows I guess $XRP is here to stay & I'll just have to start to love it ;)
1210 2018-01-08 22:35:47 The fact of the matter is that all coins are probably not worth their current market cap. That being said the valuations could continue to rise due to the irrational market. Just back to school today, and Im beginning to really appreciate cardano’s academic approach.
1211 2018-01-08 22:35:42 Crypto Vs. multi-day settlement time for international transactions and a $44.00 average fee for one international wire transfer.
1212 2018-01-08 22:35:41 i did, and they've never responded lol thats why im lost
1213 2018-01-08 22:35:41 #Ethereum (sounds like a land in Game of Thrones) & #Ripple (sounds like Fred G. Sanford’s drink of choice) are gaining share in the Crypto currency space. I’m betting on the Block Chain technology.

1221 2018-01-08 22:35:11 IMO, best to buy stocks for what they are, and not get caught up in the Crypto space....
1222 2018-01-08 22:35:09 Only in crypto can you realize you were hustled, that you bought into a meme and that a real product doesn’t exist and still wonder “should I get more?”

1229 2018-01-08 22:34:24 2018 will be the last year to earn very easy with crypto. 2019 I think there will be difficulties. In 2018 there will also be many dips but we will survive them all
1230 2018-01-08 22:34:21 It seems you switched from rooting from XVG to TRX.. going to switch back as soon as Verge goes up faster then TRX?
1231 2018-01-08 22:34:19 you can short crypto?!?

1235 2018-01-08 22:34:01 Well he hasn't replied to anyone and tell us where he got that information. I'm still going to HODL my coins and watch for a reply.
1236 2018-01-08 22:33:57 DOGE to topple bitcoin soon????
1237 2018-01-08 22:33:55 Bunch of armchair quarterbacks who seem to have the "right" answer for EVERYTHING that happens.  Never have I seen a more irresponsible group of individuals than the current crop of crypto reporters.  Absolute garbage.
1238 2018-01-08 22:33:54 Comme pour 2017, j'aurais tendance à dire que beaucoup de crypto ont de bonnes chances de se multiplier sur le long terme :)

1245 2018-01-08 22:33:33 It’s safe. They switch developer names often. Apple shuts down accounts of people who publish unverified apps like Binance is doing
1246 2018-01-08 22:33:24 INFINITE SUPPLY for $PART and you call $XVG a pump&dump? SMH
1247 2018-01-08 22:33:15 Really like the concept of @4newcoin , they are trying to address the energy demands of crypto-currencies head on. I hope they succeed.

1257 2018-01-08 22:32:30 TRX is a long term prospect, Crypto puppies will pump the price again, you might see $0.25. FLASH has gone up over 30x since I bought, still has room, maybe 2x -3x, RDD depends on whether they get partnered, price is high right now. XVG not sure, XP probably has another 2x 3x
1258 2018-01-08 22:32:25 Your MCM doesnt diversify his crypto portfolio
1259 2018-01-08 22:32:23 Ripple is the only company in the crypto space which adheres to regulations and laws. Please, let’s stop with the Fight Club attitude. Banks aren’t going away.
1260 2018-01-08 22:32:22 Mientras la gente no comprenda la importancia de la decentralizacion monetaria, la gente solo vendra a crypto solo por ganancias no por preserva de valor, por eso cualquier moneda con tendencia alcista ganara momentum sin importar sus fundamentales. #cryptomx

1281 2018-01-08 22:30:49 Use binance exchange. Send ETH or BTC to binance and trade for XRP. Binance is a crypto only exchange so thats why you need to trade USD for ETH  or BTC somewhere else like coinbase
1282 2018-01-08 22:30:39 25% of about 25 million addresses, so potentially 6 million(granted an individual can hold more than 1 address) people own 99% of BTC? That kind of trumps 2 people owning 62% of XRP.
1283 2018-01-08 22:30:37 Thanks, yeah whenever their official announcement is not even in proper English I think it's time to bail before the news

1286 2018-01-08 22:30:31 You're quite right.. I absolutely agree there are some good ppl in #fintech.

1317 2018-01-08 22:28:26 Does Arrington XRP buy OTC or on exchanges? Does Arrington XRP manage custody of its crypto holdings or have banks or corporations started to offer crypto custody?

1321 2018-01-08 22:28:08 If you’re going to invest in crypto currency you better be willing to lose it all. It’s not for the faint-hearted. I just bought some Ripple and Ark on that sale it’s having right now. #hodl #XRP #ARK #TRX
1322 2018-01-08 22:28:07 There was nothing said yet about trx.

1344 2018-01-08 22:27:01 Toujours aussi affligeant d’entendre les commentaires “financiers”! Même si les cours montent en flèche,pourquoi faut-il,dès qu’une correction arrive,parler de crash et de capital perdu?! Expliquer les crypto-monnaies par autre chose que leur cours serait certainement plus utile

1353 2018-01-08 22:26:13 【クロスチェーン】
異なるブロックチェーン同士をつなぐ技術。

現状、主要通貨のブロックチェーンはそれぞれ異なっており、互換性がないが、クロスチェーンを活用することで、異なるブロックチェーン同士の互換性が高まりやすくなる。

主要通貨同士の交換が手軽になることが期待される。

1370 2018-01-08 22:24:53 You must work for them then cause the whole crypto world is struggling but you seem to be having a ball 
1371 2018-01-08 22:24:49 Well done mate! Good start!
The founder and team of TRON are part of the reason I invested so much, they are fantastic! Check their credentials. 
Look into ICX and ZRX, I believe they will be amazing over this year but dyor
1372 2018-01-08 22:24:46 
1373 2018-01-08 22:24:42 OK guys, sorry. I won't speak again in the internet.
1374 2018-01-08 22:24:38 Anonymity is the key to the real big data. Maybe it shouldn’t come from the companies but from earlier in the chain... having just a phone number and a self-chosen username, paying with crypto......
1375 2018-01-08 22:24:35 Wow this will be my first crypto coin.

1388 2018-01-08 22:23:43 The article is about the tech and the team. Not about FUD created on the Internet by people who have nothing else to do. The Dev & team just continue with the project. Let FUDDERS be. No point acknowledging their fake news for XVG

1391 2018-01-08 22:23:30 I can't understand people who cash out their crypto (specially alt coins) and take losses just because the market has a couple of red days after a huge run, stop letting your emotions get the best of you and #HODL $xvg $mana $BRD $TRX $ADA
1392 2018-01-08 22:23:28 HODL! Jaja
1393 2018-01-08 22:23:26 “Life will find a way” is my response to US regulation slowing innovation. Crypto came from the frustration of the current banking systems, thus more innovation will come from the inevitable future regulations.
1394 2018-01-08 22:23:24 @BarstoolBigCat @PFTcommenter @hen_ease heard about PMT using the LATX alpha and even earned a little crypto for subscribing!!!! #LATX

1399 2018-01-08 22:23:09 @officialmcafee what are the chances my partner and I could get you on our Crypto Podcast being that you are influential in the crypto space? Would love to get you on and talk security and where you see the space heading!

1408 2018-01-08 22:22:11 Crypto currency is scary bc the sanctions we slap on countries is a big deal and if Russia were for example to state sponsor a crypto currency our sanctions would effectively do nothing because all the transactions will be hidden behind crypto currency.
1409 2018-01-08 22:22:05 Awesome ;)
1410 2018-01-08 22:22:05 Is there a whitelist for this ico?

1412 2018-01-08 22:21:55 I have a feeling we are all going to miss these $cryptotwitter days. Enjoy them why we can & maxout your profits. Nothing last forever & once crypto starts its mass adoption, these volatile swings will be no more.
1413 2018-01-08 22:21:51 Didn't help that China & Russia want their own crypto-currency to evade sanctions and detection.
1414 2018-01-08 22:21:47 U went from pretending u don’t own crypto to only tweeting crypto

1417 2018-01-08 22:21:30 All of this. It had nothing to do with language barrier... the whole thing lacked legitimacy and vision. There was no clear path, he bounced around all over the place, and wasn't prepared. I sold 90% of my position in TRON during the first 5 minutes of the stream.
1418 2018-01-08 22:21:22 Sounds all to familiar ($RPX )
1419 2018-01-08 22:21:21 Hey they tried. @CNBC. It just dawned on me how different of a world the Cryptoverse really is in comparison to Main Street, when a Major news network has only a vague idea of the goingz zon in the Crypto space.

1430 2018-01-08 22:20:40 It seems like you just need to put either "Blockchain" or "crypto currency" in your company's press release and watch your stock just shoot up.....
1431 2018-01-08 22:20:36 As long as it's not yet the end
1432 2018-01-08 22:20:29 Major altcoin bleed taking place atm. Make sure no matter what you do, never sell your #coins for a loss. Always be strong and #HODL during these periods as downturns in the #crypto world will always happen. HODL through this bleed and watch your coins come out even stronger .
1433 2018-01-08 22:20:23 $music seeing nice amounts of buy volume...I like. Fans of music, musicians, and equality should def look into the @musicoins project.

1434 2018-01-08 22:20:22 What a guy he is  loving that pink suit 
1435 2018-01-08 22:20:20 XRP is decentralized, open and permissionless. There is no counter-party risk. It can never be frozen and txs can never be reversed. It is unmatched in the crypto world in terms of speed, price and scalability...yes def a shitcoin 
1436 2018-01-08 22:20:12 Awesome
1437 2018-01-08 22:20:00 That last tweet was instantly fav’d by a bot that seems to like startups.

1448 2018-01-08 22:18:48 I have 0 issue with mean words and negativity, ignorance is what i have an issue with. You support a coin and hate on others, people like you are the biggest issue crypto will have in the future, all this bashing crap is what makes the whole community seem childish and toxic.

1460 2018-01-08 22:18:22 I criticised XVG performance. Got blocked by vergecurrency and their developer. So that is how they deal with dissent. Clearly running scared.

1470 2018-01-08 22:17:41 The lady at chase actually told me that “technically she should close my account for being involved and asking about cryptocurrency”... she said the CEO hates crpyto

1481 2018-01-08 22:16:57 The point of crypto was anonymity. Not building BTC. But I guess the name Cryptocurrency didn't give it away.

1554 2018-01-08 22:12:26 @SatoshiLite  Do you feel any concern as the market seems to focus on other smaller/“cheaper” altcoins right now?
1555 2018-01-08 22:12:21 This is only the start. I saw someone streaming their crypto transactions the other day, with no steps taken to protect private info. Mind boggling

1559 2018-01-08 22:12:01 @awilkinson so what % of net worth do you think is healthy to keep in crypto?
1560 2018-01-08 22:12:00 Crypto like every other currency can be used in illegal way and that does not mean we should think any less of it.

1598 2018-01-08 22:09:33 Perhaps they should include a small percentage to give to charity or development. Without a percentage of some sort it will only benefit the big players while others doing small transactions are left holding the bag. #XRP #dumporpump ? #Crypto

1606 2018-01-08 22:09:10 Could be @blockchain they've got a London office too. I might just keep tagging crypto / blockchain companies randomly haha!
1607 2018-01-08 22:09:03 I have a feeling that in a few months we'll also be using this other line from that movie as it relates to some crypto dramatis personae: "He's not the messiah, he's a very naughty boy"
1608 2018-01-08 22:08:58 If so.. how ?
1609 2018-01-08 22:08:53 bitcoin FXはロング(先に買い後で売る)で行う方が安全。多少高く買ってしまっても，待っていればもっと高く売れるのだから。逆に先に売ると，安く買い戻そうとしても相場がもうそのレベルに戻ってこない。大損する前に買い戻すこと。コインは減ったままだが，円での価値は取り戻せる。

1624 2018-01-08 22:08:15 Ja lap! Ik had keiveel geld kunnen verdienen met crypto’s. Nu niks anders dan verlies dankzij de Proximus panne. Ik weet niet of Proximus nog een provider voor de moderne mens is. .
1625 2018-01-08 22:08:09 Today, I've been in two palo alto coffee shops and overhead 4 conversations about crypto currencies
1626 2018-01-08 22:08:07 Just realized that link has probably nothing to do with US *facepam* but still. ESTA is enough for you.
1627 2018-01-08 22:08:07 Wait, I just found out it's all been stolen a week ago. Welp. My crypto career is over. It was only worth like $40.
1628 2018-01-08 22:08:05 @wissmarketing what are advantages of joining your premium group? and how many spots are open?

1632 2018-01-08 22:07:58 Yes... but the crypto industry always goes up and down. So minus well invest a decent amount haha. One kid invested a thousand dollars when he was like 13 and now he’s one of the youngest millionaires at age 18 I think.
1633 2018-01-08 22:07:57 you mean the coin that has a massive sell wall sitting there? just waiting for the price to hit a certain point so everyone holding can dump all at once?  are you talking about the coin that's been out since 2014, but has only had a website since the hype of crypto went global?
1634 2018-01-08 22:07:52 you only like to buy em if they're already 10x right?
1635 2018-01-08 22:07:50 Really.. Whats your price prediction?? #TRX
1636 2018-01-08 22:07:49 Bloody Monday #crypto
1637 2018-01-08 22:07:48 It was a FUD news that caused a partial crash on the price after an awesome rally. The fact that you and all the people on this thread know about it means that the news got enough reach. It is an obvious question to ask. I don't know why hodlers are so salty.
1638 2018-01-08 22:07:47 @BithumbOfficial how come my crypto transfers/withdrawals are being delayed? They used to go through in mins...now days?
1639 2018-01-08 22:07:45 I will buy 10k for that price

1652 2018-01-08 22:06:39 And to be fair, crypto scams are still relatively unsophisticated compared to real world scams. Looking forward to the 2nd generation of crypto scams.
1653 2018-01-08 22:06:33 I need more followers to help get the word out on some great Crypto currency. Ones to follow, buy, trade, etc... As well as opinions on exchange sites and more. If u missed out on the BTC, there are a few real hot ones out there to get in now before they take off.

1664 2018-01-08 22:05:56 Extremely coherent response.

1667 2018-01-08 22:05:47 Thanks a lot man, I am already a member of the Goon squad and following @NodeInvestor closely too. I rediscovered crypto 7 months ago and want to make it full time now!
1668 2018-01-08 22:05:43 Lmao ran into the same problem. Managed to get a little at $0.30 but would’ve had WAY more had I spent more on gas. Classic noobie mistake.

1673 2018-01-08 22:05:28 Some crypto folk assume attacker can see every pc value, every data address, every branch and order/timing. Then show that none of those ever depend on the secret key or plaintext.
They don’t worry about how those could leak, just assume they can.
1674 2018-01-08 22:05:24 @officialmcafee Whats your opinion on coins/tokens that grow quickly ? Like @Tronfoundation for example? There is a new one now @LIFEtoken_ that's up almost 500% Crypto world is crazy.

1677 2018-01-08 22:05:09 @Haydaaaal Hello, tu me conseille d'investir dans quel crypto ? ( genre de la crypto safe où tu peux faire un * 10 et après tu revend)

1679 2018-01-08 22:05:08 AWESOME!
1680 2018-01-08 22:05:00 Its always good to take profit. If you are looking for other coins to invest in, I would look at $ICX $VEN and $FUEL on Binance. $QTUM $STRAT and $ETC are looking prime right now. Also keep an eye on $OMG she is headed to $40 soon. Thats about 53% ROI just to that point.

1690 2018-01-08 22:04:25 Meh. I kinda like following @_Kevin_Pham; his whole Duncan MacLeod/Highlander approach to crypto is fun to watch.
1691 2018-01-08 22:04:22 I folded some laundry between the crypto world chaos...I'll call that productive.
1692 2018-01-08 22:04:19 Why would the question need to be asked when ip addresses are not being leaked. Addresses are remaining anonymous. 
I have a question for you. How comes you do not use the power of the Internet to learn the truths & only go on fake news?
1693 2018-01-08 22:04:14 That is what I like about the crypto space-new game with no logic and huge gains
1694 2018-01-08 22:04:14 How does it work? Do vendors have to take $XVG or does the card convert your crypto to fiat upon use?

1762 2018-01-08 21:59:07 That's exactly how I see it, which makes me wonder -- is it better to found / work in a crypto startup now, or after the crash? Aren't most web startups post-2000 the successful ones?

1771 2018-01-08 21:57:57 How may of you made money out of the #BTC dip today, if you guys knkw TA then you would of been able to make a pretty penny out of it. If you dont already understand any technical analysis then learn, maximize your profits, #TRX #XVG #Crypto
1772 2018-01-08 21:57:56 oh how I have been drawn in by the $. with all the sales happening in #LindaCoin don't hold on to it, it is still in the beginning stages and the expnention growth to come will be well worth the reward. #goLinda the crypto currency world has captivated me. #teamlinda #Cryptopia
1773 2018-01-08 21:57:55 Thanks for the follow @Crypto_Brahma, @DMORG_82, @MyBoostSite, @StateOfTheDeep, @dev_listings & @krystenthorpe1!
1774 2018-01-08 21:57:50 Balonun bir kapasitesi vardır
Daha fazla havayı içine alamaz ve patlar
Crypto para üretimi için çalışan her insan, o balona bir parça daha hava ilave etmiş oluyor
Sonuç malum, balon patlayacak ve her patlayan balonun yerine yeni balonlar gelerek sömürü sürecini devam ettirecekler
1775 2018-01-08 21:57:44 Is anyone really buying above 100 sats?
1776 2018-01-08 21:57:42 100 JPY(BTC): 1333.902 ~ 1334.673 KRW(BTC)
1777 2018-01-08 21:57:42 Thats what I'm doing, then to hopefully send it to a reliable exchange, not hitbtc.

1781 2018-01-08 21:57:19 People who are deep into anonymous, anarchic crypto are not competent to talk about Onecoin cause it is something different and not for you guys. So before stating scam be sure to educate from proper sources. Unfortunately many mlm people promoted it wrongly
1782 2018-01-08 21:57:16 Hm? I'm from Brazil =s
1783 2018-01-08 21:57:13 筋肉…
1784 2018-01-08 21:57:13 Can you please look at Myriad? There is some buzz about it right now.
1785 2018-01-08 21:57:12 Lol. Bought at 0.20 selling at 0.20  
How is that a fail?
1786 2018-01-08 21:57:11 im going to shove the nerd who was trying to shill his crypto in tylers game into a locker i think
1787 2018-01-08 21:57:07 Crypto is in a fun new pattern of rising and falling, and dumping into ETH
1788 2018-01-08 21:57:06 Are u sure that u contact the real ethconnect? When I messaged them, I never get auto reply. But it seems like u get auto reply
1789 2018-01-08 21:57:03 I want some XVG
1790 2018-01-08 21:57:00 For once, i'm really excited by a crypto. If you guys are into cryptos at all I would suggest looking into ICONOMI $ICN. 

Basically it lets noobs buy into a diversified crypto portfolio without managing anything themselves.

I put $500 on and I'll update how it goes!
1791 2018-01-08 21:56:57 I would start with all the free videos on Youtube first. There are hundreds. Then some of my favorites are @ChartGuys @Goonalerts @NodeInvestor these are the absolute best value for the content they provide. A+ Traders too. They are true day traders.
1792 2018-01-08 21:56:50 $MUSIC up to 760 sats after this afternoon's dip to 500. Still time to get in and out before the "huge announcement" and make some quick btc. Keep your eye in this one and be ready to get out before the news !

1793 2018-01-08 21:56:46 Quel crypto vous choisissez pour 2018
1794 2018-01-08 21:56:45 I got some lit footage of them going for it but that’s one of my fav songs right now so I put it up instead
1795 2018-01-08 21:56:35 Can you take a look KIN?  Thanks Haejin!
1796 2018-01-08 21:56:29 Came so cose to selling 10 mins ago for $smart... phew
1797 2018-01-08 21:56:27 It won't happen IMO. Companies that large have every incentive to create their own coin if they choose to go crypto. The Alibaba crap has nothing to do with the current price- TRX is still poised for greatness.
1798 2018-01-08 21:56:23 I have many EMB coin in cryptopia and yobit . 

In yobit exchange the trade enable but deposit off . 
What we can do ??
1799 2018-01-08 21:56:20 Well, this was clearly an untruth.
1800 2018-01-08 21:56:17 I think this one is obvious: whitepaper is conception, genesis block birthday 
1801 2018-01-08 21:56:15 Sorry but i think youre beter at crypto:) join the uspsa for ultimate Shootingfun.
1802 2018-01-08 21:56:15 I forgot EU is privileged. Good luck.
1803 2018-01-08 21:56:15 Think your still be waiting a few hours for it
1804 2018-01-08 21:56:15 now they will never leave crypto space...just waiting for ref link for binance and shilling some shitcoins
1805 2018-01-08 21:56:11 Thanks! Haven't decided yet, but a bunch of places for sure :)
1806 2018-01-08 21:56:10 Makes sense because Venezuela is kind of a crypto-country.
1807 2018-01-08 21:56:02 No worries the recent @Ripple drops were not because people were pulling their investments but because @CoinMarketCap decision to removeXRP prices from Korean exchange desks from the total average. #xrp #ripple #xrpthestandard #cryptocurrency
1808 2018-01-08 21:55:51 and fees on Binance are 0.05% only! The lowest on the trading of crypto
1809 2018-01-08 21:55:50 Did any of you or your staff buy any crypto currency during the inevitable dip today, also do you think you should have disclosed what was clearly price sensitive information earlier, also would you welcome some sort of regulation to make you do such announcements.
1810 2018-01-08 21:55:46 It's a non-immigrant, just to visit, ain't that hard ^^

1817 2018-01-08 21:55:31 Hey Vincent how do we turn our profits from crypto into fiat? Every bank and credit union says they will close my account for investing into crypto
1818 2018-01-08 21:55:20 I like $MGN because it checked all the boxes for me up front. The node cost is relatively low in comparison to other similar projects, plus it has a low market cap and it’s not on many exchanges or even CoinMarketCap yet.
1819 2018-01-08 21:55:15 I just want to visit, calm down xD
1820 2018-01-08 21:55:12 How is crypto better than google pay or apple pay? Transactions, fees, technology? Decentralized i understand but do uou thing cryptocurreny will surpass large corporations like Apple and google?
1821 2018-01-08 21:55:07 What about verge??  Update please soon!!
1822 2018-01-08 21:55:07 I find it funny how the make news reports on the bad things that happen but when a crypto goes up like 500% it’s barley on the news
1823 2018-01-08 21:55:06 Binance SUCKS. Why didn’t you tell us everywhere it can be purchased?
1824 2018-01-08 21:55:01 ill buy your Soul for 12btc Dm if interested
1825 2018-01-08 21:54:56 "Giving someone crypto" sounds like transmitting a venereal disease
1826 2018-01-08 21:54:50 I'm not going to live there yet, just applying for a visit
1827 2018-01-08 21:54:50 I disagree, can't ever get the crypto back out of it once it is there. Don't try to send bitcoin, ether or others from gatehub, it will disappear like magic.
1828 2018-01-08 21:54:50 It's stupid and confusing to new people. I'm not salty but I can point out when the crypto community is not doing itself any favors.

1839 2018-01-08 21:54:36 That has been my point the whole time. When crypto starts to affect prices, in a perceivable way, govs will act at light speed
1840 2018-01-08 21:54:19 Y’all crypto pros tell me this, when i ask my friend who is into crypto why he wasn’t in TRON or that other alt coin all y’all were talking about his answer was “they are a scam” and that “other coins have far better intrinsic value”- in short, why are some a scam and others not?
1841 2018-01-08 21:54:07 I don't set stop losses.

1855 2018-01-08 21:53:09 I always make it a point to diversify my portfolio with different coins AND exchanges to mitigate losses. Remember that #cryptocurrency is a risky investment and you should take precautions.

1873 2018-01-08 21:51:59 What about verge?
1874 2018-01-08 21:51:56 Then before you know it, crypto is the new USD, but at a huge sacrifice. I think their mindset is if you can't beat them, fool them. They aren't laying down like it appears to most.
1875 2018-01-08 21:51:41 I remember when Bitcoin was a mysterious and untraceable crypto currency only used by pedophiles and goons using the silk road. Now it's part of your dad's investment portfolio.

1880 2018-01-08 21:51:35 Haven’t looked into $CRAVE or $DSR yet. I can only speak for $MGN at the moment. It’s a young project, but so far I like it. It’s an early play with good potential upside. Community is growing. Roadmap looks strong. Masternode runs smoothly.

1906 2018-01-08 21:49:43 Not that I can recall.. I did remove everyone from my twitteraccount when I left crypto in ‘15 but I cant remember having an arguement with him. We used to DM ict stuff sometimes but other than that? 
1907 2018-01-08 21:49:42 If you can’t afford a few bucks a month you’re doing crypto all wrong. Take up fishing or something else. Whenever polling on a free platform the answer is likely to be no.

1931 2018-01-08 21:48:33 guess i am in the mid 30 bracket which is: max bitcoin to buy some gold, silver and realestate and hodl the rest of crypto.
1932 2018-01-08 21:48:32 I see you wanna be a bag holder in 2018 #TRX
1933 2018-01-08 21:48:24 So? Many people support crypto for the idealism that it sticks it to the IMF/Fed Reserve not realizing they have their hands in projects like Ripple. It will do exactly what the USD did, watch. Price will shoot up, become valuable, over inflate, blow up... yadda yadda.
1934 2018-01-08 21:48:21 "The first time you hold a crypto private key you are probably experiencing sound money for the very first time."

Poor dude has caught the "crypto" fever inanity big time.

1937 2018-01-08 21:48:12 We are in a BULL MARKET guys. If your not making money EVERY SINGLE DAY your doing something wrong. Find out what that is and fix it. This is just the beginning too. There are trillions of dollars coming into the market this year.  People cant even sign up right now!!
1938 2018-01-08 21:48:12 you buy at Coinbase with your credit card, then you transfert it to Binance to buy and sell currencies from your Bitcoins wallet And if you register to Binance with my referral URL, I give you cash back on your fees !

1942 2018-01-08 21:48:00 What is this for?
1943 2018-01-08 21:47:59 Binance down but i had enough time to get in and out of $newl today and sell all my crypto and went long $btc at 13100 and my acct keeps going up today thanks binance.

1947 2018-01-08 21:47:51 Unfortunately you will not get your money back.  OneCoin @OneCoinCrypto @OneCoinInsider is a blatant fraud, preying on those with little to no knowledge of crypto-currencies & taking full advantage of their eagerness to get in the game.
1948 2018-01-08 21:47:49 MOOOOOOONNNNNNNNN?
1949 2018-01-08 21:47:44 Simple reminder to invest responsibly folks. Being a "paper millionaire" in crypto is very high risk. It's never a bad idea to take some profits and work towards a debt free life. Pay off your mortgages and credit and your investments will be satisfying and stress free #crypto

1973 2018-01-08 21:45:41 The fact that you have to trust the government that is backing the fiat, is a major flaw. The good crypto's are all trustless and have a fixed rate of supply. You may prefer to have the value of your capital's purchasing power diluted but that doesn't make it superior to crypto.

1979 2018-01-08 21:45:11 To everyone thinking we're in a Crypto Crash.

Remember Bitcoin was $6400 at the start of November. Corrections are becoming shorter and smaller. Volume and awareness rapidly rises to ATHs.

In my opinion #BTC will be $25,000 before we know it and soon rise to $50,000 from there.

2084 2018-01-08 21:37:52 BNB only provides a 50% off the trading fee by paying with BNB. The commission is directly from referrals. You could hold no BNB do no trading and still get commission on your referred accounts trading. Yes they burn BNB which should act as a type of revenue generation.
2085 2018-01-08 21:37:51 funny how that works
2086 2018-01-08 21:37:46 $pac buyers have almost completely eaten thru the 1 sats sell wall @Cryptopia_NZ ... Sellers, pull your 1 sat offers and let a 1 sat bid build. This isn't rocket science. You're the noobs allowing ppl to buy at 50% discount @PaccoinDEVs @PacCoinArmy
2087 2018-01-08 21:37:38 Any one in crypto should watch this guy hea an og hacker who knows his stuff and know how all the tech works and he has alot of tron toohttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ7BxVh03JM8w6nRW89QXSw

2093 2018-01-08 21:37:18 The crypto market is being affected by China intention to clamp down miners as people think that would make the market crash. However miners is one thing, mining pools are another. The biggest mining pools where the coins are mined are in China but not the hardware itself.

2097 2018-01-08 21:36:51 Yeah I don’t fully understand the crypto currency yet but I know that at $.17 a piece is worth since they are going up and bitcoin  is coming down it went from 17k a BTC to 15k
2098 2018-01-08 21:36:48 Anyone have a good resource for stats on crypto exchange outages + downtime? Looking for something more specific than "abysmal." Some of you day traders must track this.
2099 2018-01-08 21:36:47 This was a quite hard rolling coaster day on crypto marketcap !

2103 2018-01-08 21:36:36 I want to invest into a masternode and I am thinking between $MGN vs $CRAVE vs $DSR. Which one do you recommend as first?
2104 2018-01-08 21:36:33 $FUN under 1000 sats is a good buy.  

If they are first to market with decentralized online casino gambling hold on to your bits.  We are gonna rocket!

2107 2018-01-08 21:36:27 Please edit this page on the article as we all know you are not accepting LTC for PAC via Cryptopia. Tons of people will read this page and start trying to set up and account via @Cryptopia_NZ . People should know the truth that the exchange is Lagging big time in accommodations.

2121 2018-01-08 21:35:19 Not sure I understand the risk part? How does attracting more people make it risky? Also how will they compete? Look at how binance has out competed bittrex, it's not because of customer service, server speed, and beautiful layouts...
2122 2018-01-08 21:35:10 this crypto currency is crazy. good time to buy ripple if you haven't yet.

2128 2018-01-08 21:35:02 Tron is doing something the others arent- acquiring customers.  Crypto is here to stay...the ones that have usage will prevail.  Its just too early to be even close to 10b
2129 2018-01-08 21:35:01 trx did rise more than 500% in just a week, a little dip after is totally normal and even good if it does.  people panic when a coin dips 40% after a rise of 500% in a week? I dont think crypto is something for u then, sorry. Just telling you this to prevent you for losing money.
2130 2018-01-08 21:34:58 The roadmap will break us up.

2132 2018-01-08 21:34:56 Yeah, there is FOMO for everything on Binance
I think relatively $zrx is better project than a lot of other shitcoins sitting over $1bn cap. Raiden is another one out there not FOMOed but great potential.
2133 2018-01-08 21:34:52 :O I thought you dont want to discuss it. 
Im willing to use their tech once its out, fully working as promised. No bias. 
Until that point - pass.
2134 2018-01-08 21:34:42 Don't fall for those MLM companies that are venturing into the crypto currency space! They offer to trade for you, but really you can do it yourself. Without the need to "recruit" others for commissioned seed money.
2135 2018-01-08 21:34:38 + time to buy
2136 2018-01-08 21:34:38 No
2137 2018-01-08 21:34:34 This is the scariest part about crypto...you can make a ton of money, but can you actually cash out to fiat? If not, then what have you really won?
2138 2018-01-08 21:34:31 Part of the ignis lunch was based on a snapshot on 28th dec n a ratio 1:0.5 nxt to ignis was suppose 2 b distributed... well long story short... it has been a disappointing story laced with multiple failed promises... Theres so much good alts out there. My advice= buy sumt else
2139 2018-01-08 21:34:30 Start zooming out already. #NEBL will definitely go up even more in the upcoming week.
2140 2018-01-08 21:34:25 This idiot doesn't even mention mt gox. Mt. gox caused the first rise and fall, it's not real
2141 2018-01-08 21:34:20 I'll start announcing what crypto I'm buying so you can sell. As soon as I jump in that wave crashes. #crypto

2143 2018-01-08 21:34:18 Herkesi bir şekilde crypto para işine çekmek için bankalar batırılacak. Bitcoin ve diğer kripto/crypto/şifreli paralar bu sene çok değer artacak :) Bu yoldan dönüş yok gibi.

2151 2018-01-08 21:33:53 I don’t think the common purchaser of crypto thinks of it as VC or buying into a company. Instead they see it as a ‘get rich quick’ scheme, investing without understanding that they are essentially gambling. Education and regulation will help people from losing their life savings
2152 2018-01-08 21:33:42 Considering this was an interview with the "team". Some questions are answered in first person format. It would have been helpful if you identified who was that.  Also you could have hinted about the big announcement.

2168 2018-01-08 21:32:59 Kucoin was working fine for me earlier. Cryptopia too.
2169 2018-01-08 21:32:58 that's great and all but I think most of your clients use your service to cash out their crypto's into fiat. Since the card fiasco your service is basically rendered useless.
2170 2018-01-08 21:32:49 Big exchange listing is imminent, you're stupid if you bail out of VeChain but I'm guessing that you don't hold any VEN anyway.

2172 2018-01-08 21:32:36 CNBC. You got it all wrong. Hire someone that actually knows WTF is going on in the crypto community so you can actually have an informed community. Oh wait-- you don't want people to be informed. You'd rather have sheeple.
2173 2018-01-08 21:32:34 That's got to be a factor
2174 2018-01-08 21:32:31 Not sure why Korean exchanges would not be included regardless of the substantial price differences. Either way, the Korean market accounts for a large percentage of the entire crypto space... so #WTF
2175 2018-01-08 21:32:26 Crypto investors are just looking for that next hot crypto with an 'X' in the ticker. The first person to put out a coin with ticker XXX is going to be rich.
2176 2018-01-08 21:32:25 @justinsuntron TRX is one of the strongest crypto-coins I've ever seen. Even with the impact caused by Korea, it remains strong. Congratulations TRX !!!!
2177 2018-01-08 21:32:24 Look into DBIX, Georg.

2189 2018-01-08 21:31:34 this conversation clearly going nowhere... just a thought for you.. to transfer 100mln$ using XRP cost less than 1$ in fees - clearly no purpose... but to buy $5 game online and pay with bitcoin cost $15 in fees - future
2190 2018-01-08 21:31:32 Dont believe everything @RDDWhale says hes more often wrong then not.
Try to argue with him in a mature and normal way and you instantly get blocked doubt a real invester like @Haejin_Crypto would do the same.

Just keep your head in the game and dont blindely follow whales

2191 2018-01-08 21:31:28 This week I picked 4 mini cap coins that have strong chart fundamentals. $Snov, $Tks, $Cred, and $Prl. Bought small positions in each and will see what they do this month, Tks is my favorite and Cred is a pick by my best crypto advisor. These are all good bets.
2192 2018-01-08 21:31:27 This may be pedantic, but there are language/grammatical errors which might not seem a big deal, but given whom you’re competing against on the global crypto scale, it is a big deal and off-putting to big investors.
2193 2018-01-08 21:31:25 1. Sell shoe for retail
2. Spend all my money for crypto
3. Sell for less than pay 
2194 2018-01-08 21:31:25 That last RT reminded me of the Spy Museum in Berlin, parts of which were a bit off (friend us on Facebook for a 2€ discount!!1!) but it had a nice section on crypto machines from WW2 and the post-war era. Got some ok pics I'll share them here.

2228 2018-01-08 21:29:11 Haha just buy a few more Tron and you can cover that loss easily
2229 2018-01-08 21:29:04 Can’t wait Bags of both here and Masternodes
2230 2018-01-08 21:29:03 My body is ready.
2231 2018-01-08 21:29:02 strange guys sarah buddy , dont worry about it  . thanks for the good info .
2232 2018-01-08 21:28:56 have a look at LINDA.. I’m getting educated and interested so Watching some stuff lately.
2233 2018-01-08 21:28:55 Crypto için bu güzel bende kullanıyorum
2234 2018-01-08 21:28:47 Seems a little unclear to me, have you tried adding steam coming out of it to make sure people understand that this is a fresh chart?
2235 2018-01-08 21:28:47 But hey, your the boss.
2236 2018-01-08 21:28:46 Exactly...
2237 2018-01-08 21:28:45 @ZackShapiro you know who runs Raigames?
2238 2018-01-08 21:28:32 booooo
2239 2018-01-08 21:28:30 Such a naive comment @demirag, he would buy them with the crypto that was sent to him for it. If he wanted to sell, he would just sell on the exchange.
2240 2018-01-08 21:28:28 Hi Alexander. Klopt 't dat jij een crypto telegram groep hebt?
2241 2018-01-08 21:28:13 Cobinhood no fee crypto
2242 2018-01-08 21:28:02 DeepOnion is good, very low marketcap, PoW/PoS, privacy-oriented, private messenger, smart contracts (already a feature allowing to register documents) and democratice governance. All this at 50M marketcap.
2243 2018-01-08 21:28:00 After checking your profile...Lol.. more like you welcoming me
2244 2018-01-08 21:27:58 And it's almost all the way back again. You don't need to report on crypto, you don't know enough about it.
2245 2018-01-08 21:27:52 $DGB here we go!
2246 2018-01-08 21:27:52 Kucoin is one of the best crypto exchanger site. Hoping and wishing of more and more success of this crypto currency exchanger site.
2247 2018-01-08 21:27:49 Looks like $kucoin can't handle all the traffic
2248 2018-01-08 21:27:48 Que raro que tengas la 1080 y no la uses para jugar jajajaja

Por lo que veo va bien esa crypto
De 2018 he leido en fc XRX Y PAC o algo asi
2249 2018-01-08 21:27:43 Crypto “killed” the start-up seed round: people who wrote $10-25K checks to startups are rapidly putting that money into ICOs instead.
2250 2018-01-08 21:27:40 In crypto you have to be ruthless and not get attached to coins. I always look for ways of reinvesting the profits into ICO’s I like.
2251 2018-01-08 21:27:37 I never participated any ICO. Is there any good one on pre-sale or sth? Is there any minimum amount to invest? I prefer the ones I can put really little money $btc $eth $ico $crypto
2252 2018-01-08 21:27:29 agreed. no point selling them off. I have 500 coins. Holding them.
Who knows, may get to $20 each like KCS did a few days ago.
2253 2018-01-08 21:27:23 Please come to my #CES2018 keynote: "Crypto-HERency: The Role of Bitcoin in the 'Me Too' Moment"
2254 2018-01-08 21:27:19 All this is happening so fast. I started in Feb-March 2017 with $7k and I will be a millionaire soon. Fucking hell. No sanity in crypto.
2255 2018-01-08 21:27:12 I look forward to seeing this tomorrow morning 
2256 2018-01-08 21:27:12 How about instead of buying a fucking Lambo with your crypto earnings, instead you work towards making an impact on the future for the better
2257 2018-01-08 21:27:10 $STRAT is like the terminator, it just keeps going
2258 2018-01-08 21:27:08 Crypto currency is not a Bubble!!!
It is just a lot of people putting real fiat on a coin !!!
2259 2018-01-08 21:27:04 I dont want to keep polluting everyones twitter feeds with Crypto and im starting to take some strides so I will be marketing a bit. if you want to keep seeing stuff i share, have a common interest, or are an investor looking to get into crypto follow @RobinsonCrypto
2260 2018-01-08 21:27:04 @social77media Have you taken a look at some of the interviews from the UFO Disclosure? I'd love to see your analysis on the pilot.

2262 2018-01-08 21:26:59 @monte_crypto_ , straight from the horse’s mouth
2263 2018-01-08 21:26:59 It does. I just don’t think RE are going to be a part of that future, the demands for crypto infrastructure are going to be too high. Where I think we will see growth is in areas with less regulation, on both financial and energy sides.
2264 2018-01-08 21:26:46 I received your tip. Thanks and I'll talk to you ;-)
2265 2018-01-08 21:26:41 Mostly spambots tweeting about $GAME $Crypto. Time to start a bag.

2267 2018-01-08 21:26:38 If I have time this week I will have to do a post about fiat crypto debunking all this. Fiat crypto is just account balance sheet expansion to everyday joe. It is not innovative in any shape or form. There’s a reason why banks don’t do this at the moment.

2276 2018-01-08 21:26:17 Best thing that happend in crypto? Crypto Twitter, aight! $moon $mybizeps $etc
2277 2018-01-08 21:26:16 @ummjackson Really enjoying yr vids. I'm working on a story about crypto for @nymag & wd love to include yr perspective, perhaps we cd chat?
2278 2018-01-08 21:26:09 The pound is a synergistic all incompassing crypto space. Like a university for life thats not encumbered by the old paradigm. Thats where i found the augmentors.
2279 2018-01-08 21:25:59 its a really good coin,10 seconds do transfer to my computer wallet.I see a bright future on this coin!
2280 2018-01-08 21:25:54 Só Crypto currency has a lot to improve at this moment we not seeing the real power of the coins and companies!!!
2281 2018-01-08 21:25:43 $BLITZ the next coin to 100$+ (insert talk of some no name hard fork, roadmap updates, masternodes, etc). just buy it. It's like the last coin on trex that hasn't blown up. Time will come.

2282 2018-01-08 21:25:41 Bitcoin is often gets up to 20% of my portfolio, while I never put more than 2% in any alt coin. It’d make no sense I would want the reserve currency of crypto to die.
2283 2018-01-08 21:25:40 The #PacCoin Community has helped answer so many basic questions about crypto trading that makes me wonder why none of these other bigger companies even make an attempt to educate people on trading? Thanks @PaccoinDEVs @paccoin_net @PacCoinArmy @RTRamdath nd everyone else
2284 2018-01-08 21:25:39 9) use separate offline computer when you create your backups like memory cards, usb keys etc.
10) never trust your printer and don't use paper wallets
11) when storing large amounts of crypto consider using multi-sig wallets
2285 2018-01-08 21:25:35 In the general public and mass media, the term “Bitcoin” to describe all crypto has become what “Kleenex” is to describe all facial tissue...it’s irksome. #CryptoCurrencies #Education #bubble #tulips #pleasestop
2286 2018-01-08 21:25:25 Omg you really dont get it... Hold this coin and it will reward. Its up and down and you bought just before a dip, it happens. But dont panic, it will be up and up and up in time :)
2287 2018-01-08 21:25:17 your arguments are FUD headlines... clearly no research
2288 2018-01-08 21:25:15 Ahh şunu ben de söylüyorum ama bir türlü yapamıyorum. %50 alt-%50 btc ile güzel güzel giderken analize takılan coine, oooo bu çok güzel yerde diyip dalıyorum. Sonra %85 altcoin %15 btc oluveriyor portföy :)
2289 2018-01-08 21:25:08 I guarantee I paid for more hookers and drugs using crypto than mcafee
2290 2018-01-08 21:25:00 What??? Why on earth then you confirm withdrawals and send confirmation links to email addresses and then emptying to zero crypto wallet balances??? Why don't you prevent users from accidentally dumping their wallets??? Is a NY holidays vacation for a whole month Russian style???
2291 2018-01-08 21:24:59 Nooooo! They are taking your cryptocurrency and banking off you. Think MORE. SALT YOU KEEP YOUR CRYPTO .
2292 2018-01-08 21:24:56 What coins are you invested in on that site
2293 2018-01-08 21:24:55 Maybe #Binance can use all that crypto dust they make us leave to buy some more servers...

2305 2018-01-08 21:24:03 you`ve said it... 15th richest man in the world on the worthless XRP... you contradict yourself a bit here... back to "centralized" - 3 main holders of XRP vs 3 bitcoin mining cartels... what is the difference? in both cases they can dump and crash the market if they choose so
2306 2018-01-08 21:23:50 you going for crypto attacks?
2307 2018-01-08 21:23:49 Lots of #altcoins are bleeding red today in #Crypto. Yet, don't buy into the fear, instead buy into the FOMO (Fear of Missing Out). #XRP #XLM #TRX #FUN #MANA #POE are just some of the notable names I'm investing in. A lot working against the market right now, but it pass.

2318 2018-01-08 21:23:19 im gonna be putting all my dollars in crypto before i spend a dime on garbage marvel, 2018 not looking promising, after phoenix resurrection i think that will be the end of 2018. Because they threw SJ into x-men red, im not buying it.

2329 2018-01-08 21:22:34 This was hilarious, if people would've calmed down and checked around they would've seen that CMC dropped the Korean prices. But no, of course not, it's crypto! Panic sell time!
2330 2018-01-08 21:22:33 What site/app do you use to buy your crypto currency?
2331 2018-01-08 21:22:16 They may not be your world.  But to them, you are theirs.

2337 2018-01-08 21:21:51 Stop looking at getting rich out of thin air. This train has left the station a long time ago. Be grateful that you can make some cash out of crypto, an opportunity that was not available some time ago.
2338 2018-01-08 21:21:47 I like technical analysis. Ty
2339 2018-01-08 21:21:44 Would be most helpful
2340 2018-01-08 21:21:39 See a lot of people complaining about being down a ton on crypto today, it’s so weird it’s almost like you got swindled into putting all your money into pump and dump coins so other people can make a profit off you. DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH. SPLIT YOUR PORTFOLIO INTO MULTIPKE COINS.
2341 2018-01-08 21:21:36 Invested in #TRX about a week ago. NOTHING BUT LOSSES!!!!! Waiting for it to hit 0.20 so I can dip and invest in another coin. #TRON #cryptocurrency #crypto #xrp #bitcoin #ethereum

2351 2018-01-08 21:20:53 Hey, terrible posts lately from this account. $BTC is the original and will always have a place in crypto. Why are you even motivated to attempt a 'hostile takeover' ? Let's share our technologies so in the end everyone will win. I just can't relate to this PR tactic.@bitcoingold

2356 2018-01-08 21:20:41 I do. But I disagree on that $XRP is just to steal our crypto. It has a purpose.

2366 2018-01-08 21:19:59 Call me crazy that $v and $ma aren’t best shorts ever if crypto really becomes mainstream.  I wouldn’t make that bet today
2367 2018-01-08 21:19:53 
2368 2018-01-08 21:19:52 hiç söylemiyosun :D
2369 2018-01-08 21:19:43 That doesn't make too much sense either. $BTC, $LTC, and $BCC are all ones and zeros. Just as $XRP to a really basic level. The value is what people are willing to pay for it with fiat. That it doesn't have any value to you, doesn't mean $XRP is worth $0.00
2370 2018-01-08 21:19:43 Rejection? How about well channeled rumor that got out of control since the second wave of stupid money entered in crypto world? All that over useless crypto, a shitcoin that has 0 value. Yes 0.

2377 2018-01-08 21:19:19 I haven't made it public, although I'm seriously considering it now! I see the monetary benefits by linking to a few of my crypto wallets for donations. I'm a very adept low-level coder with over 20 years experience on various platforms. Maybe you have some ideas? THANKS!

2382 2018-01-08 21:19:02 Isn't it only ~$3.7B tether in circulation?  That is not much in comparison to entire crypto space?

2384 2018-01-08 21:18:48 55 billion XRP is are in a crypto locked escrow for 55 months. The CEO who created MT GOX is the CEO of XLM .. do YOUR research.
2385 2018-01-08 21:18:47 Good read!  This is the most informative update the crypto community has gotten on XVG in sometime.  This is more of what we need.  @crypto_rand isn't hyping the coin and @vergecurrency isn't hard selling.  Thanks guys!  Nice work!
2386 2018-01-08 21:18:44 I do not believe Bitcoin is going to rule crypto forever. That’s not an attack. That doesn’t mean it’s going to die. That doesn’t mean it won’t keep going up and make everyone a lot of money. Bitcoin remains a core position in my portfolio.

2388 2018-01-08 21:18:36 With the fall in value of crypto assets, i see a rise in the return of bonds, cash reserves and stocks.
2389 2018-01-08 21:18:35 if you refresh the page you'll see theres still about 2500 btc sell wall at 2. it dissapears shortly after that. Page can't handle it or something
2390 2018-01-08 21:18:33 $LIZI is about to pump.
2391 2018-01-08 21:18:31 Also of note, I have been watching my other coin #Verge. It seems supported around 1000 sats which should signify the end of wave 2. Wave 3 should take us to 6000. Yes 6x.

2395 2018-01-08 21:18:22 You do know that TRON is just a simple $ETH token right? No real software to back the whole thing up.
$XVG on the other hand has a vision that's get backed up by the code the devs write... I really hope you didn't sold your #VergeCurrency, else you're a moron. No offense...

2421 2018-01-08 21:17:17 A change in the way CMC reports Korean value of XRP was one and induced a small panic sell but other than that just the normal volatility of crypto. I have been waiting for a 10% drop as it’s been surging so much lately. 24-48 hours more and we won’t even notice it happened

2433 2018-01-08 21:16:33 To be honest the entire @Bitcoin family is a cheat and a scam. While other coins are working hard to bring a better crypto currency experience to the world #ADA, #XLM,  etc. All #bitcoin + #BitcoinCash does is to cheat to maintain dominance. Shame on you guys.
2434 2018-01-08 21:16:33 I buy all those things too I just don't know anyone that takes crypto for sex

2453 2018-01-08 21:15:09 Nice, great timing as I believe Crypto/Blockchain stocks will soon get a nice boost (my guess is February) & you want to be invested in solid plays before then
2454 2018-01-08 21:15:07 @mcuban I'm seeing a lot of people saying you started a crypto currency called mercury protocol. Is it true?

2461 2018-01-08 21:14:52 I love crypto because no one knows anything. The very few people that think they know something mostly don't know anything, these are the same people that say I told you so when you fail at an investment, but never take a risk in their lives.
2462 2018-01-08 21:14:48 Hey. I am interested in getting some #nxt but I am confused with this ignis launch. Do you think is a good buy? Trying to get some more info from people that know this project?
2463 2018-01-08 21:14:44 
2464 2018-01-08 21:14:26 And the total crypto market cap just keeps growing in general.  Would not surprise me if it ended up being a lot less than .05% when $DBIX reaches 200 USD
2465 2018-01-08 21:14:26 Been trying for 2 weeks and followed all instructions and having syncing problems
2466 2018-01-08 21:14:14 Sounds like important work. My point is that rising crypto prices will incentivize even more rapid advances in generation, storage and distribution networks, whether in solar, nuclear, or fossil fuels. That counters the simplistic bitcoin-will-destroy-the-planet narrative.

2474 2018-01-08 21:13:57 Today was an interesting one in the #Crypto community. A lot of panic selling. Stick to your plans and do not invest more than you are willing to lose.

2478 2018-01-08 21:13:52 My thoughts for 2018.

Money alone makes no one happy. 
Share the love and help others.
Set goals and focus on reaching them.
Don't judge, do good to other people, give back.
Spend time with the loved ones.
Life is short, but it's worth living.

Have a blessed year 2018! #crypto

2497 2018-01-08 21:12:44 Lol wut. And why would I support a shit coin like #bitcoin? Here we go: How can a crypto based on proof of work be more centralized than a crypto run on servers? Not to mention 70% of #xrp I'd held by one group. I think we have a dumbass on our hands

2501 2018-01-08 21:12:38 You're right I shouldn't sit on this. But it has been like this since I ever started there when RPX was listed. Also that shit was rekt.
2502 2018-01-08 21:12:37 @ummjackson you seem to be straight forward at dumbing down crypto currency. If I understand it correctly is it kinda like crowd sourcing  ? How do they gain  money and influence so fast? I kinda feel like an asshat. I bought like 300 shares of dogecoin only to see it means nothi

2509 2018-01-08 21:12:12 @NickDunnCNBC You understand "crypto" = cryptography/cruptology, right? That Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, right? And that you ignorantly hosting something 3rd-grade named like "CryptoDesk" simply proves what total amateurs both you & CNBC are, right?
2510 2018-01-08 21:12:10 slow transaction, enormous fees... did i miss anything? Big companies stop using bitcoin... its nothing more than store of value.. like a gold.. but you don`t pay with gold bars in the shop when you buy milk do you?
2511 2018-01-08 21:11:58 The irony that virtual mining of bitcoins is causing a severe enough non-virtual environmental impact that the Chinese government is pulling the plug on crypto.
2512 2018-01-08 21:11:55 Crypto-cards that perform SSL offload?  But those require software driven policy.  I'd say the author is speculating in futures, current state = most things "security" are software.
2513 2018-01-08 21:11:50 How are their $ETH deposit speeds right now? A lot exchanges are experiencing difficulties. Took 3 hours for my last tx to show up on Cryptopia.

2516 2018-01-08 21:11:40 Yuppppp...again!!!
2517 2018-01-08 21:11:40 Crypto Currency being embraced by people who love to vote other people’s taxes up is a strange dichotomy.

2526 2018-01-08 21:11:09 Binance Crashed. 

Interesting to see how most people are on that exchange and is having issues. Can be a big problem for crypto as a WHOLE!
2527 2018-01-08 21:11:07 That’s nice to hear man!!! Keep going and never rush. Take profits along the way :)
2528 2018-01-08 21:10:49 Whaaaaat?

2530 2018-01-08 21:10:42 This is what made dogecoin great. Strangers immediately becoming friends via crypto.

2532 2018-01-08 21:10:37 the binance logo involved here... hmmmm... guessing something with crypto?
2533 2018-01-08 21:10:35 @CryptoMessiah I just listened to you on Crypto Street podcast. I only started at the beginning of March 2017. I've learned quickly, been very successful, and it seems that I have developed the same strategy as you.
2534 2018-01-08 21:10:35 Tezos is the most anticipated Crypto project to launch this year. Unfortunately it has an incompetent and careless person running the foundation. Johann Gevers is stalling one of the best projects and should be replaced by people like Olaf Carlson Wee who are truly interested.
2535 2018-01-08 21:10:34 Proof that Justin sold his 6 billion tron?

2613 2018-01-08 21:06:03 Right, not disagreeing, but that first major decline was clearly linked to Justin's live stream. It was a train wreck, and trx went in free-fall for a bit.

5) Encrypt all drives / flash disks where u store your keys / recovery words - you can use Ledger's/Trezor's GPG functionality.
6) Don't store much crypto on your phone, ever

2673 2018-01-08 21:02:05 Your talking points are out of date. Go back to headquarters and freshen up.
2674 2018-01-08 21:01:45 Just found this. Very interesting. First thought was unless you tie a note to it such as the dollar etc. But then the notes would have to be secured and guarded by honest people. $ started great but guards let warmongers devalue. Crypto seems way more truthful, kind and saner!
2675 2018-01-08 21:01:45 Lol keep investing in your centralized shit coin. #XRB Master race
2676 2018-01-08 21:01:40 If your going to write about crypto you might want to get educated. This isn’t the STOCK MARKET there are NO bull runs LOL! Research the charts and do some analysis! Ripple is a joke just like the bank coins will be.
2677 2018-01-08 21:01:29 On desktop app it seems, World on Android
2678 2018-01-08 21:01:26 Bitcoin & Litecoin. Je pense qu'à part être aguerri en crypto, altcoins et/ou trading en général, il est un peu tard pour investir après la flambée de novembre. Le pire dans l'histoire étant d'essayer de devenir trader alors qu'au fond de nous on déteste les traders.
2679 2018-01-08 21:01:21 They started letting new users signup again today (limited). The site hasn’t let me do anything for an hour or so.
2680 2018-01-08 21:01:12 Adding a bag, yolo
2681 2018-01-08 21:01:06 Bitfinex has closed new user registrations. Guys get your accounts open on these exchanges if you want to day trade Crypto.
2682 2018-01-08 21:01:02 Don't you go checking that crypto market on your  now....
2683 2018-01-08 21:00:58 Lambos on the moon? Of course not! That would not work due to the cost to transfer them there.  I will settle for another beach house.
2684 2018-01-08 21:00:54 Good sign? Bad sign? Kinda both? Lol
2685 2018-01-08 21:00:52 @VibeMotivation love the tweets you are sharing about crypto world. Keep on tweeting and thank you:)
2686 2018-01-08 21:00:52 People ditching #litecoin now. Pretty much a complete shit coin compared to say #XRB and #pascal coin. Hell even #XRP is better than it.
2687 2018-01-08 21:00:51 So #Bitcoin may have a ceiling in numbers. How about all other cryptocurrencies? Whenever somebody wants a new one, they create it. So, we may end up with hundreds if not thousands of cryptocurrencies. Many with no ceilings, whatsoever. And who sez Bitcoin is the ultimate crypto?
2688 2018-01-08 21:00:47 After a discussion on how AI/software companies can mine crypto & transact: Daughter - Can cats  bitcoin? Me - well if you mine and legally leave the setup to the cat & connect it to apps that will use it to pay for electricity/ caretakers/cat food/rent, I guess so...
2689 2018-01-08 21:00:44 とりあえず１００万枚集めます。

2690 2018-01-08 21:00:42 So ICX, NEO, OST, OMG, WABI.... what else do I need to fill my bag with before the big money starts pouring into crypto?
2691 2018-01-08 21:00:41 I agree 100%
2692 2018-01-08 21:00:40 Make it happen  im all hodl
2693 2018-01-08 21:00:37 Yes
2694 2018-01-08 21:00:34 Tron at this stage can inflate and deflate in a matter of minutes as well. I purchased at .04, and it inflated to double digits, and then the next days to 31 cents. Just know that it’s up to where it is now from .03 last week. Can’t just look at the decline.

2697 2018-01-08 21:00:17 did binance crash again?
2698 2018-01-08 21:00:17 Both Binance and Bittrex (two of the bigger crypto exchanges) have paused new registrations because they can't handle the volume of new users...it's crazy how many people are realizing the value of cryptocurrencies!

2711 2018-01-08 20:59:32 I wonder who bought up 17 mil of #xrp during a (manipulated) crash which you @CoinMarketCap only chose to notify everyone you were excluding one of the biggest markets (Korea) in your calculations, until hours after you caused a huge panic sell across the entire #Crypto

2815 2018-01-08 20:51:28 Look at $ELIX #Elixir. In my opinion one of the best project for 2018
2816 2018-01-08 20:51:27 If you payed in crypto to have someone murdered, hit that follow.
2817 2018-01-08 20:51:27 Maybe these crypto-geniuses can help us some day figure out how to donate other forms of investment, like stock and securities. But only if we could totally micromanage how the beneficiaries manage them, of course.

2831 2018-01-08 20:50:17 In which case, 25% of the money you owe me, which is what I probably would've invested in crypto currency, needs to be valued as if I bought it for $40, but then sold it for the $1,100 price today
2832 2018-01-08 20:50:17 Not much buzz about $PLR, but it broke 1$ today and is hovering at $1.30 today.
Id like to know twitters thoughts on it. #crypto
2833 2018-01-08 20:50:09 Self-serious crypto investors are, ironically enough, pretty funny. Like come on man, people are clicking their mouses a few times to gain and lose insane amounts of money, you gotta have an appreciation for the sheer absurdity of these things.
2834 2018-01-08 20:50:04 @Crypto_Katana what are you views and expections on the next successful AltCoins for 2018 ? Which have you invested in ?
2835 2018-01-08 20:49:58 @Scrubings Thoughts on Bytecoin? I know you are into crypto, and wanted to hear some opinions while I am doing research on it.

So can you please do a mass diversification, vertical integration vid. Not just investing in crypto diversely, but a whole strategy, owning hardaware, contracts, master nodes, and how to invest the profits in short, mid and long term holds ? Love the show

2850 2018-01-08 20:48:59 Rule of Crypto-Acquisition No. 3.:

3. Never pay more for an acquisition than you have to.
2851 2018-01-08 20:48:57 Only if you have a South Korean bank account (good luck getting one without citizenship or business there).  Crypto to crypto isn't profitable and they require you to have a bank account now anyway.
2852 2018-01-08 20:48:52 Another clueless person on crypto.
2853 2018-01-08 20:48:51 Great advice.  Too bad the crypto world is filled with immature impatient whiny little bitches.

2: Make $250k off of crypto investments. 

3: Escape the rat race of society.
2868 2018-01-08 20:48:13 This baby boomer also laughs at such headlines. I have spent quite a lot of time discussing crypto with my contemporaries. It frightens many of them because they don't understand. Then I ask them to explain fractional reserve banking, and they can suddenly see how crazy it is.

2872 2018-01-08 20:48:06 I updated my crypto currency blog post with a new lesson I made learned. Bitcoin has stupid transfer fees, whereas Ethereum charges much smaller fees and it does the same job acting as a transfer currency between coinbase and binance - so that ought to save you a tenner a pop.

2890 2018-01-08 20:47:07 and who is the "team" you spoke to?
2891 2018-01-08 20:47:04 Me
2892 2018-01-08 20:47:04 Basically, put 25% of every dollar you owe me in crypto currency, right now, then don't touch it. The value of those when you pay me what you owe me is based on the price right now. So if they go up or down you still owe me the other 75% in money.
2893 2018-01-08 20:47:00 0.06% controls 60.6% of bitcoin.... Just saying...
2894 2018-01-08 20:46:59 This answers none of the BS that's been flying around. seems like a shilling of a white paper.

2924 2018-01-08 20:44:40 For example, if you owe me $1,000,000, and you put $250,000 of that in crypto currency, then when it comes time to pay me if the coins are worth $300,000 you still owe me the other $750,000 in cash.

2975 2018-01-08 20:41:49 In conclusion, yeah. But I think it‘s hard to proof they did this harm on purpose. I know, the law in the USA states that the accused party has to proof its innocence. In Switzerland we‘re used to the opposite thinking. Also there‘s no regulation in crypto…

2978 2018-01-08 20:41:47 I didn't get the point of Bitcoin until I understood the importance of decentralization. We need to emphasize this when we introduce our friends to crypto. Otherwise they'll just think crypto is a bubble/fad.
2979 2018-01-08 20:41:47 I brought up #enigma #eng multiple times and as low as $4.50. During today's minor #bitcoin meltdown, #eng was able to stay stable and ride the wave. It's team is strong and their goal is clear with a lot of room to grow.

I want 25% of every dollar you owe me to go to that.

3017 2018-01-08 20:38:51 you have a question?
3018 2018-01-08 20:38:49 TBF the bubbles you & I witnessed occurred on regulated exchanges.  With crypto trading on unregulated private platforms with no transparency, no capital requirements, self dealing etc, one should expect a different life cycle. Not all crypto is corrupt, but much is fraudulent.

3044 2018-01-08 20:36:58 Biggest concern is salient hallmark is ‘limited supply’. But now there’s over 1,500 different coins with numbers increasing everyday. We often reference Tulip mania but nothing compares to the Dutch experience like this. Crypto, like tulips, won’t disappear, but valuations will.

3115 2018-01-08 20:31:04 Crypto is the new Cyber.
3116 2018-01-08 20:30:58 And perhaps you missed the point that Bitcoin is electronic Cash and not just a store of value.  BTC has gone astray.
3117 2018-01-08 20:30:51 I'm new to this cryptogame but if you all haven't, invest a little, even $10 you will see how amazing this world is! At this moment in time, you have a 99.9% chance to earn a profit with crypto with a minimum of holding it for one week. HODL $TRX $HTML $WABI $APPC $AMB

3121 2018-01-08 20:30:08 hi ppls
3122 2018-01-08 20:30:08 You're not wrong and I hope that if they can find the correct equation to make it happen that it can remain stable. Crypto currency is still a very plausible substance. It's not guaranteed which makes creating stable chains cumbersome at best.
3123 2018-01-08 20:30:06 It is. Announcement or not. Thus would've happened anyway. The pattern says it all. It's clear to anyone involved in crypto reading charts. There will be a"BOOOM" 
3124 2018-01-08 20:30:06 Stop checking crypto prices so often 
3125 2018-01-08 20:30:03 That 39% steak tax tho

3130 2018-01-08 20:29:35 I recommend contacting the @CFPB, and warning others on Reddit. The crypto community doesn't need more Mt.Gox type of activity, whether it comes from Coins-E or @vigsun or @Coinbase or from whoever.

3155 2018-01-08 20:26:49 Two things worth sharing/noting today regarding crypto:
A) Current global adoption is still at or below 1%.
B) Mainstream adoption will not happen until these coins and platforms become usable, relevant PRODUCTS.
3156 2018-01-08 20:26:45 Another misleading post that leaves xvg out of the spotlight. Makes you think, with everyone trying to hold verge down it is keeping it's value better than anything else. Strong coin. About to explode. Remind me in 1 week what the price is.
3157 2018-01-08 20:26:38 the thing is, i havent even given a reason imop. I actually really like $Safex and i hold quite a lot. Maybe this was a misunderstanding.  I tweeted this to the safex Team, maybe i get unbanned. nonetheless i am exited for the future and what is to come at $safex.
3158 2018-01-08 20:26:38 lol
3159 2018-01-08 20:26:37 Not exactly sure, I see the next wall is at 5 sat so after this is cleared up it will go up quickly and that would be a big gain considering g it's a 1 sat now. Just a matter of getting these other exchanges going to match the volume so the market isn't stuck.

3171 2018-01-08 20:25:36 $NYC making me a believer. It’s front running the entire #crypto and #alt #coin market with practical everyday use. Retail stores, restaurants & even a fitness club have adopted $NYC as a pymnt option. It’s up over 7x in 4 days & was 15x. It’s still cheap at 1428 per $1. Buy in!
3172 2018-01-08 20:25:35 the answer is in the question.

3197 2018-01-08 20:23:01 Stabilize actually means that they have accumulated a level of wealth which they then want to keep. The way they try to keep this is usually by lobbying for regulations which make it difficult for competitors to get a fair chance. Remove regulatory element, and you have crypto.

3209 2018-01-08 20:22:18 My hindsight would endorse the same view. Further evidence the best crypto is not always the best investment.
3210 2018-01-08 20:22:17 $DBIX  to 10x from here  (from $20 to $200)
There are 1,829,926 DBIX available. If 1 DBIX is $200.00, it's market cap would be $365,985,200, which represents 0.05% of the global crypto market cap.

3227 2018-01-08 20:21:09 As @ProfFaustus points out, capitalism drives constant innovation. What we have seen in the West with the emergence of monopolies, is actually a desire to stabilize instead of grow. Push regulations which prohibit/ rising competition. Crypto is unique in that sense, no regulation
3228 2018-01-08 20:21:04 How do you define a professional trader? I know plenty of professional traders including myself with over 10 years experience trading crypto’s. The volatility is there to be taken advantage of. There is no volatility in futures markets these days.

3234 2018-01-08 20:20:44 Crypto is obvi in a bubble. Ripple is one of the largest companies in the world. I think it's similar to the .com bubble. One day it'll "pop" but legit crypto projects will still be around as the internet was after the .com pop

I think the crypto killer app will be whatever Facebook makes. (Mark is currently “studying crypto”)

3256 2018-01-08 20:19:23 Me and my team @yourcryptoguide will be at the North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami next week, excited to hear from @telcoin_team, other crypto enthusiasts and network crypto style
3257 2018-01-08 20:19:22 Atleast it has utility unlike 99% of other crypto.
3258 2018-01-08 20:19:16 Still trying to accumulate dips on $ZEC and $DCR

Also threw some chikun into cold storage because fuck it if $LTC can into $300 than it can into $1000 (eventually)
3259 2018-01-08 20:19:08 We are in the same boat dude. How do you feel these days ?
3260 2018-01-08 20:19:05 So that means that only the price is down on coinmarket but not on the exchanges ?
3261 2018-01-08 20:18:55 How long have you been in crypto. You know nothing!!
3262 2018-01-08 20:18:54 You sound jealous because you can't shut down the greatest redistribution of wealth in modern history 
3263 2018-01-08 20:18:51 So I have to do the swap by myself? 
3264 2018-01-08 20:18:49 Crypto.. failing? Oh, you don't say.
3265 2018-01-08 20:18:49 The Fact that you idiots are tryna defend him is mind boggling, in any circumstance it’s not right to put your hands on anyone unless they put hands on you that’s when you start trading off but just to go and attack someone not right at all no matter who you are

3270 2018-01-08 20:18:37 @maxekaplan How are you planning to get possession of EOS coins once the EOS product releases in June? Aren't US citizens and people in the US banned from possession of EOS?

3274 2018-01-08 20:18:19 I never thought I'd see the day CNBC 'Closing Bell' talks about getting crypto traders to enter the stock market. Every other headline is about crypto! Exchanges not meeting user demand! This is just getting started! Welcome to the ground floor of the financial revolution.

Ask him what "information" he's researching lol. He should be reviewing charts. Information? So obvious he's clueless. He's the joke of the crypto world
3282 2018-01-08 20:17:42 This is a real threat to .@facebook. #Zuck has to speed up his #crypto strategy execution. It’s also a kinda of a race between the western world & the ROW. Let’s see who gonna crack it. #messenger vs #telegram vs #Wechat

3285 2018-01-08 20:17:26 Don’t sell pac if at lost. I think music will still pump until 10th. But pac can’t pump in sats, until Crytopia sort it out.
3286 2018-01-08 20:17:25 @reddcoin is upon a potential pump SOLELY considering the interest of @MarkZukerberg introducing crypto into Facebook. In no way am I implying that Facebook has sights on @reddcoin but The crypto space has already build rumours and potential hype.
3287 2018-01-08 20:17:24 @RichieAllenShow crypto currency is bollocks and max keiser is a total fraud, no one in their right mind would invest in bit coin

3291 2018-01-08 20:17:13 But sir I studied crypto for 2 and a half dayz.
3292 2018-01-08 20:17:13  @FT has embarrassingly bad coverage of #bitcoin and often times completely misinformed...on a global scale it is symbolic of how slow to evolve the London financial culture is. Compare this to the coverage out of Tokyo and NYC it’s crypto years behind

3298 2018-01-08 20:16:43 Ty. Appreciate it. I hope everyone can make it out with bank. Or any type of decent profit. Once in a lifetime opportunity we here have here with crypto, and I want us all to prosper. No time for hate

3302 2018-01-08 20:16:32 Well indirectly I guess I did pay it off with crypto haha. Yeah I know my score will rebound, just annoying on the timing because I'm on the market for a house as well.

3323 2018-01-08 20:15:00 Binanceで取引しても残高に反映されない現象に遭遇。
多発してるらしい。

・3ZEC売却 → 0.13BTC という取引をする
・取引完了してるのに残高には反映されず。
・仕方ないから残ったZECを板上に売却注文（成立しないような価格）
・その注文をキャンセル
・すると残高正常化

という感じでした。
3324 2018-01-08 20:14:55 I suppose i should have used the word "suggestion" instead.
3325 2018-01-08 20:14:54 Bitcoin has flatlined just like all Crypto. A few pumps here and there but the entire Crypto space has been sleeping, paralyzed since early December. The Crypto market needs to wake up, its too slow and getting boring with no gains for over a month. What the heck is going? Smh..
3326 2018-01-08 20:14:53 On Wednesday we are planning to go to Tel Aviv. I'm new in crypto currencies. Can someone in the embassy guide me? For example where to buy external wallet like nano in Israel? Thanks!

3328 2018-01-08 20:14:51 This has to be a piss take. I am fond of your Work and appreciate the quality of your content but this makes a mockery of crypto and what its all about. This will be one of the shit coins that eventually sinks to the depths taking with it a lot of your credibility.  Shocked in u!
3329 2018-01-08 20:14:50 So sell off PAC and try to buy back in 3 weeks...yeah...either way its just matter of being sensible lol school first. Wish i can pay them is cryptocurrency come to think of it but they are so backwards. Maybe my kids will 
3330 2018-01-08 20:14:45 I think you can expand that idea to all of Twitter. 

Politics (news), sports betting, crypto etc. sifting through the garbage and finding talent is incredibly important and can really be useful.

3332 2018-01-08 20:14:43 I got some FUD today. It was a video on CNBC about Ripple dropping 30%. Worst possible source to get your investing decisions from.
3333 2018-01-08 20:14:37 Will go back up in this stratosphere! I bought xvg and Trx after the massive surge when the prices were low.

3338 2018-01-08 20:13:51 @CryptoChoe If you had to make a wild guess, when do you perceive a major crypto market crash and or bubble burst? I'm fearful there's quite a few overvalued coins out here currently.
3339 2018-01-08 20:13:48 I have a small position on twitter but I've spent the last couple months working for another ICO. As that wraps up I just received an offer to fly out to Cali over the weekend to meet with a CEO who wants me to be his community manager. Crypto has changed my life! #Cryptocurrency
3340 2018-01-08 20:13:45 oui puisque cetait la premiere fois que j'utilisais une plateforme pour acheter une autre crypto J'AI JUSTE 0.00285 BTC je voulais echanger ca en etn

3342 2018-01-08 20:13:41 The ridiculous barrage of crypto attacks from elite BANKSTERS tells the tale. They are terrified! Easy, accessible, no middle man currency IS A BIG PROBLEM FOR THEM.

3361 2018-01-08 20:12:24 I am very confident about these tokenised assets. I think they will survive and continue to behave as investments in the future. However for Bitcoin to survive, it must become a currency. I think. There are no cryptocurrencies, only crypto assets, right now.
3362 2018-01-08 20:12:21 Coinmarketcap is toch een beetje de Dow Jones van de crypto-indexen dacht ik.
3363 2018-01-08 20:12:18  @ume_ada follow back ma, I want to talk to you about crypto currencies and single motherhood.
3364 2018-01-08 20:12:10 if I am mistaking it, then so will many others, so its good to clear it up. Pre-mined also indicates that people dipped their hands in the cookie jar before they were allowed, Its clear that this is not the case.

3374 2018-01-08 20:11:24 Smart investor  hell nah. If you were smart you’d buy into Quality coins. Says the guy who’s weekly allowance is all in ripple  Bruh you prob just joined Crypto this month  don’t act like you know shit. Learn the foundation and basics bitch

3394 2018-01-08 20:09:45 The interest in crypto right now is insane. 

Everyone is making money. Everyone is an expert. Scary and awesome at the same time.
3395 2018-01-08 20:09:38 Corrections are the way of a free market, that’s why we must observe support patterns... hopefully government attempts at regulation with help stifle scammers and legitimize the space... but if the stock market can survive, crypto surely can as well 
3396 2018-01-08 20:09:37 Please dont invest in the crypto market if: 
1. You dont have a clue
2. Trying to make quick money
3. Dont have money your willing to lose
4. You are willing to stay in it long term

3402 2018-01-08 20:09:08 This is a greatest gift / reward to be distributed  in any  crypto currency  history.  Wish i could  have  part in this.

3404 2018-01-08 20:08:55 ビットクラブのシミュレーション：
1シェアー当たりの採掘量は，これまで一定値で近似できましたが，9月15日から減って来ています。2018-01現在は以前の1/6ぐらいに。採掘量の変動を考慮した形に改良してみてその減少ぶりにびっくり。
3405 2018-01-08 20:08:55 crypto breakthrough is far less likely than time travel. but the "other" option does allow for sneaky things, which other comments have already mentioned

3408 2018-01-08 20:08:37 Wow, despite mostly buying #btc, #eth has climbed enough to be the most valuable holding in my crypto portfolio. To the moon!!

3410 2018-01-08 20:08:33 One hundred millionth*

3415 2018-01-08 20:08:20 you may be right but to me all of these still seems 10X in 2018
3416 2018-01-08 20:08:16 ありがとうございます！
3417 2018-01-08 20:08:11 What's strange is that my invisible friend Col. Schvatz told me that exact same thing the other day... ;)
3418 2018-01-08 20:08:09 hello, comme indiqué précédemment avec mes screens, nous sommes dans le vert tandis que le reste est rouge. nous avons plus d'ether que de btc depuis plus de 24heures, et sommes sur, entre autres, les coins cités dans mes posts précédents.
3419 2018-01-08 20:08:07 @crypto_sarah9 hey there was just looking through your profile truly some quality material there. Would you care to take a look at mine and kindly follow back. Thank You!
3420 2018-01-08 20:08:05 COME ON @Cryptopia_NZ ... How long can it take  to get LTC and DOGE up and running !! ? You are killing us.
3421 2018-01-08 20:08:02 I started on crypto years ago just using faucets. The pay out was tiny but I learned how they worked. Now they're worth thousands. Every little bit helps. #Crypto #CryptoFaucets #bitcoin #BTC #LTC #Dogecoin
3422 2018-01-08 20:07:53 Thanks :-) 0x4095e8bb3e6d242a55bc15a29dc79a7518efd3dd
3423 2018-01-08 20:07:48 Im two weeks in and been earning some good crypto with. @Viberate_com
3424 2018-01-08 20:07:46 $Ost simple token! Great company with low supply check them out!
3425 2018-01-08 20:07:42 An exchange like "The Rock Trading" @TheRockTrading lists XRP at 2.17 (current price according to CMC) yet accounts for less than .01% of volume. Meanwhile, the three Korean exchange are price outliers even though they account for >40% 0f XRP volume. They cant be equally weighted
3426 2018-01-08 20:07:42 @xOchoa ¿sigues minando, cuál crypto moneda?
3427 2018-01-08 20:07:35 The moon mate, given it's Porsche trading competition on KuCoin and then adding to Huobi tomorrow. Huge potential. Might end up holding small bag long.
3428 2018-01-08 20:07:33 Hell nah! Let’s find out how that works for you ;) the whole fucking point of crypto is to get away from big banks and the govt. obviously you don’t have any principals. So your telling me it’s okay to be spies on and to know my every fucking move ?
3429 2018-01-08 20:07:31 See my pinned tweet. It just launched in December
3430 2018-01-08 20:07:25 Allright. Thanks.
3431 2018-01-08 20:07:25 Retweet this if you want bro to make crypto calls...
3432 2018-01-08 20:07:20 But it's not like an extra millions of coins were mined and put into Dev/creator pockets before the fork. Which is generally what most pre mine coins have. Creators hold the most and get it before the public. This is not the same thing with a chain split.
3433 2018-01-08 20:07:20 I actually wanted to ask your advice about investing in crypto currency, then some overly emotional Scottish midget deleted the discord.
3434 2018-01-08 20:07:18 Absolutely. I think $ARK and $XRB are the best coins poised for mass adoption in everyday transactions.
3435 2018-01-08 20:07:04 Whatever floats your boat, lol... I really don't get these "Crypto Clans" and how they back some currencies like they're political candidates or whatever.. I just like Verge's technology and their vision... I own both so I got skin in the game for #trx too lol.
3436 2018-01-08 20:06:56 @Poloniex it wont let me sign on every time i try to log in. why?! I created an account, and would like to start my crypto exchange...
3437 2018-01-08 20:06:52 The front 9 of this crypto life tells me I better have my driver primed for an Eagle or better  .
3438 2018-01-08 20:06:49 Great info for all ya newbies to crypto... what’s your take on ‘deep onion ‘ it be appreciated, thanks
3439 2018-01-08 20:06:47 So that live stream caused my ADA, XLM, XRP to also go down significantly over the last few days? All top coins have been down except a select few. Anytime BTC starts picking up speed, alt coins tend to decline in value.
3440 2018-01-08 20:06:44 Just when I thought I could keep keep dancing to the $MUSIC this school bill cant be broken into a payment plan...they dont want me to be great  so which goes first... $PAC or $MUSIC?
3441 2018-01-08 20:06:29 Which crypto will have the best year?? #cryptocurrency #bitcoin #ethereum #litecoin #ripple #xrp #iota #vergecoin #nagacoin #hitbtc #coinbase #bitfinex #bittrex #gdax #coindesk #cointelegraph $btc $ltc $eth $xrp $xrb $dash $ada $trx $rhoc $xp $eca $poe

3443 2018-01-08 20:06:16 Previoys years till the 3rd quarter 2017 are those believers of doge... Last dec a massive buying of volume those are new investors and traders who bekueve the potential of this very undervalued crypto.. Its 1.7B market capital not even 1% of btc

3445 2018-01-08 20:06:06 Great to see #usitech bring out such a great whitepaper for the new #techcoin. I am very impressed as a serial investor. Given the bad press from recent US events it definitely puts them on the map with this amazing new #crypto

3453 2018-01-08 20:05:28 I really think this is the case
3454 2018-01-08 20:05:28 Do you keep your crypto in the exchange or the wallet? Could just write a script which does the trading for you
3455 2018-01-08 20:05:27 The best? The Verge-Community...it was my first crypto and I believe in this nice story  in my opinion it‘s the one and only private coin 
We‘ll all see us at the 
3456 2018-01-08 20:05:23 Ripple is not a crypto currency it’s like an sql database
3457 2018-01-08 20:05:19 I personally love that. It's awesome.
3458 2018-01-08 20:05:19 Becoming more and more difficult to differentiate genuine calls for coins with real value from mere shills on #cryptotwitter #crypto #DYOR
3459 2018-01-08 20:05:15 Tons of upside, if someone is looking to get a couple thousand coins that can 5X or 10X then IDK why people haven't considered $SC and $DGB that are int he top 25 and 50 already with practically no marketing...
3460 2018-01-08 20:05:14 Sebebi basit. Bu adamlarda cok para var. Direk almaya çalışsa fiyat zıplar alamıyor. Mecbur korkutup sattirip aliyo. Çok paran olursa anlarsın . Bende de yok yanlış anlama ama olanlari biliyorum

3464 2018-01-08 20:05:04 Brilliant idea to scam people to buy the top. Kek.

3470 2018-01-08 20:04:46 Be careful out there people. This trend of coins pumping 500% over night with no news, no product, no nothing will not last and is bad for #crypto. Lots of youtubers like @TeamJRBusiness are pumping shitcoins for their own gain. Find good projects and do your due diligence.

3483 2018-01-08 20:03:59 Welcome to the joy of crypto. It's never an exact science. You take your best educated guess and be patient.
3484 2018-01-08 20:03:53 ABSOLUTELY. Truth is objective. People thinking that just because they have an opinion it's 100% truth. 
3485 2018-01-08 20:03:48 crypto could shit on that
3486 2018-01-08 20:03:47 Eh, fuck Ripple it's not a crypto, just buy Paypal or Bank stocks if you want that.  Crypto was created because of the Bank bailouts and now the sellouts are supporting it, you should change your username.
3487 2018-01-08 20:03:41 So was your crypto portfolio affected? Mine went up today.
3488 2018-01-08 20:03:38 Who's investing in crypto and what coins are you putting money in? #CryptoCurrencies
3489 2018-01-08 20:03:34 The #crypto community tends to group different ends of the spectrum. An investor sees the inherent value in something... A trader sees the potential for value in anything
3490 2018-01-08 20:03:30 No, a premine is done before a coin is released to the public. This means people hold X amount before it's live. This was a block chain copy to new network. Whoever wanted to could carry on on the new network with same amount of coins. No one had mined any extra coins.pre fork

3500 2018-01-08 20:02:35 Crypto is the perfect example of "if you say something long enough, it eventually becomes reality".
3501 2018-01-08 20:02:30 What makes you so bullish on TRX?  Its been going under a lot of FUD, some of which seems deserved.

3504 2018-01-08 20:02:09 November buy looking good about now :)
3505 2018-01-08 20:02:07 ik eet mijn tong ;)
3506 2018-01-08 20:02:04 True - however for trading... every crypto coin has periods of consolidation (90% of the time) where it basically doesn't make any real gains... I'd rather move my money into the coins that are *moving up* so i'm not sitting on the side lines 90% of the time.
3507 2018-01-08 20:02:03 Stock brokers that call and discourage people from investing in crypto sound bitter asf.
3508 2018-01-08 20:02:01 Look for #dips to #buy and for #highs to #sell! Long way to go before start panicking! Don't fall in the #crypto #crash trap!
3509 2018-01-08 20:02:00 ok we get it you rap about making 100 stacks but is that before or after taxes and are you putting some of that money into crypto?

3514 2018-01-08 20:01:42 Hodl seems to be the only strategy for me

3544 2018-01-08 20:00:08 Crypto almost certainly gets arbitraged in Korea all the time.    Korean-Americans can mail a hardware wallet full of goodies to their relatives in Korea, who can then sell it on the open market.
3545 2018-01-08 20:00:08 These bets have to have a time frame or its cheating
3546 2018-01-08 20:00:08 @CNBC @CNBCFastMoney please have people on your show that actually know what they are talking about on crypto such as @aantonop .  I'm starting to believe @realDonaldTrump tweets about fake news.  I never thought I would say that. #FacePalm $BTC $LTC

3553 2018-01-08 19:59:39 Also, looks like $XRP had its fun... Called it from the beginning. Over Hyped, no use cases for the currency, no customers. Choose the better more useful token $XLM instead. #cryptocurrency #Crypto #CryptoNews #cryptotrading #cryptocurrencies #blockchain #altcoins #altcoin #IBM
3554 2018-01-08 19:59:31 Correct.
3555 2018-01-08 19:59:26 what does it mean ?
3556 2018-01-08 19:59:23 A fuckin great team with fuckin great ideas ! #xrp #xrpthestandard
3557 2018-01-08 19:59:21 CB wants to appease the mainstream & adding zcash for ex will never resonate to majority of new customers who have no allegiance to crypto. There will eventually be CB competitors who won’t hestitate to add xrp. Adding on CB could give liquidity which is XRP biggest flaw
3558 2018-01-08 19:59:14 You get it? (Yeah just opened my purely crypto account. Now 3- personal, professional, and crypto!... getting deep)

3561 2018-01-08 19:59:11 You are changing words to suit your doublespeak.  A premine is when someone has an opportunity to *mine* before anyone else does.  It was a chain split that resulted in BTC owners having the same coins they own on both the chains. It was mineable right from the start of BCH
3562 2018-01-08 19:59:07 Living in their parents’ basement. Just like they still are.  RT @Jcenky: Where were all these “twitter crypto currency experts” just a year ago?
3563 2018-01-08 19:59:00 Dow and S&P rising, my hypothesis is that institutional money dumped their positions in $crypto to pump stocks
3564 2018-01-08 19:58:48 Because Korea is taxing crypto, crypto isn’t meant to be taxed

3574 2018-01-08 19:58:15 Does anyone know how @CoinMarketCap goes about averaging the prices for each crypto. It can't just be the price on each exchange divided by the number of exchanges for that token right?? @haydentiff @XRPTrump @TBCrypto
3575 2018-01-08 19:57:57 #xrp Again what I see when I read these 'Source' tweets is 'Boy I really HOPE this goes to $150 by year end' #FOMO #FUD @two_wandering do you realise that your tweet means nothing. $10-$20 is realistic by simple maths. #1 however is a gamechanger in crypto.
3576 2018-01-08 19:57:56 Crypto may end up being -- among many other things -- a huge experiment on how much active investment management matters in new tech/business value creation.
3577 2018-01-08 19:57:54 Beginning to realise that crypto trading is 50% research 50% timing/patience.

3585 2018-01-08 19:57:25 I see no reason $STRAT can't hit market cap of similar protocol tokens ( $ETH, $ADA, $NEM) based on FA (upcoming ICOs, smart contracts, privacy and bitcoin core developer) and TA (price suppressed in $BTC terms from ATH) . Also ramped up marketing efforts and "secret project".
3586 2018-01-08 19:57:25 Seriously... Fuck Doge... What a joke

3600 2018-01-08 19:56:32 I used to be a lurker just like you. I assumed I wasn't smart enough so I kept my mouth shut & observed.

But reality is crypto is brand new & we're all learning at the same time. You're just experienced as I am, so if there's something that needs to be said that isn't, say it.
3601 2018-01-08 19:56:27 don't have to look at terrible Bitconnect ads every day anymore 
3602 2018-01-08 19:56:25 Every company wants to be a part of the crypto currency/block chain world. East coat freezing over, Trump still needs a diaper change.

3605 2018-01-08 19:56:10 Another great podcast. Now that I’ve binge-listened to every one of them I’m gonna need y’all to start pumping these things out daily so I stay having something to listen to on my way to work. IMO it’s definitely the best crypto podcast out there rn. Keep up the great work!
3606 2018-01-08 19:56:03 Exactly. A lot of #bitcoins just gonna be stored on some hardware wallets and sleep on them. The moment new Exchanges receive licenses for FIAT <> Crypto is the biggest risk for Bitcoins as BTC can lose value quickly that moment. In 2018 we see many movements in #blockchain.
3607 2018-01-08 19:55:58 Weird, looks like crypto currency is up today. Great prediction. Lmao
3608 2018-01-08 19:55:56 Any chance of a MAJOR exchange??
3609 2018-01-08 19:55:49 An interesting theory on today’s #correction (via Reddit):
#Coinmarketcap began excluding the always-40%-higher Korean exchanges from some price calculations, leading to artificial decline in some prices on their site, leading to real life panic selling.

Contact me, I can bring a lot to the table.
Best regards
3631 2018-01-08 19:54:02 With the crack cryptos been smoking lately we have to let these winners run no telling where she's off to
3632 2018-01-08 19:54:00 Got some $IFT $SMART $DBIX and $RNS that I'll be holding for a long time, or might just sell a bit of smart actually
3633 2018-01-08 19:53:48 me? I've been following and investing in $XVG since May... enough that I've networked with some inside marketers. but I am not on the dev team. I am a repeater of sorts... I follow and retweet the official channels and I read updates and share. and share what I'm given.
3634 2018-01-08 19:53:31 @shingolavine my family & I are hoping to change our lives financially in the next 2-3 years by investing in crypto. Would you say ethos is one of the best to invest in? We have less than $1000 to work with. How do we add 3 or more zeros to that by 2020?
3635 2018-01-08 19:53:16 @_CB01 Once every blue moon I'll go on Twitter and stumble upon your tweets and my day just gets so much better. And now you're even tweeting about crypto which is beautiful.
3636 2018-01-08 19:53:14 Listened to multiple analyst talk about the stock market being overpriced and due a correction. Not one commentator has claimed "they don't get it" or "they're just haters".

The #Crypto world could learn a thing or two.
3637 2018-01-08 19:53:02 This is more like it!  You guys all need to work together to make crypto the mainstream entity it deserves to be.  Lets see more of this from all the devs/teams out there 
3638 2018-01-08 19:52:58 Not sure why, but @CoinMarketCap Excludes South Korean Prices and as a result the Crypto Market Cap Drops by $50B.
3639 2018-01-08 19:52:57 Güzel soru. Örnekler üzerinden anlatıcam . Çok parametre si var. Önce hangi mecrada rakipleri kim onu bilmek lazım. O anki değerinden x20 - x100 olurmu buna ışık tutar.

3642 2018-01-08 19:52:41 There’s a lot of misinformation out there about #XRP. No it’s not going to hit $1000, its doubtful it’ll ever hit $100. #XRP is not the next #Bitcoin, it has a much different use. Ripple seems to be the new go-to for newcomers to crypto. If you’re new, please do your research.
3643 2018-01-08 19:52:33 God job? Meant Good job...but yeah...

3653 2018-01-08 19:51:57 This is no different than any crypto. You own STORJ? Do you own that company no. You own BAT do you own the company, no, you own BTS do you own the company no.  Still all of these have some inherit value because they represent the company.
3654 2018-01-08 19:51:53 @mike_maloney someone’s should make a crypto backed by Gold... *hint*hint* 
3655 2018-01-08 19:51:53 Did you really see tweet by the disgruntled former verge marketing team member?
3656 2018-01-08 19:51:31 Sure, if Ripple isn’t the #1 Crypto by December 31, 2018....i’ll send you 100 XRP. If it is, you have to send me 100 XRP...deal? 
3657 2018-01-08 19:51:29 Now we just need Trump to come out and state that he's starting TrumpCOIN. The market will rally....... bigly because all crypto does is win and all trump does is win so it's a win win scenario #CRYPTO
3658 2018-01-08 19:51:24 I bet they start accepting #LTC soon. Faster and cheaper then BTC.  #charlielee was looking long term when he built LTC. He created the future of crypto currency. #BTC will be known as the crypto grandfather and Charlie Lee/LTC will be the father of global crypto uses.
3659 2018-01-08 19:51:21 #btc had the choice to take over the world. Instead they just argued about how to solve fees and TX times
3660 2018-01-08 19:51:21 I only retweet myself

3663 2018-01-08 19:51:11 Everyday of 2018 has been green so far. Are we ever going to get 2 sided markets again? I’m scared that crypto being down today means people are withdrawing money to buy #FAANG stocks. Yikes. #wheredidvolatilitygo?
3664 2018-01-08 19:51:03 Is crypto currency a video game for the masses? This past weekend we experienced huge increases in most coins. This micro inflation is typical of video games that have larger userbase on weekend compared to workweek. Buy during the week lows to sell to the weekend crowd?
3665 2018-01-08 19:50:57 Anyone recommend any good sites to invest in shares/crypto currencies with low commissions? Similar to eToro etc. Cheers 
3666 2018-01-08 19:50:51 For people who invest in crypto. Look into the B3coin. Do your own research but take a very good look at it. It’s very cheap right now.

3675 2018-01-08 19:50:03 Pareto Principle applied to Crypto: 80% of the value of crypto will reside in 20% of the coins.

Now is the time to answer the question: What are the coins that will be in that 20%?

Buy those coins now and wait for the value to be redistributed.

3684 2018-01-08 19:49:14 I’m still waiting to be approved on a number of exchanges but this approach is my plan. Take out the initial investment, let the free money run and slice off it as and when the time seems right. If the worst happens the mindset is then I’ve lost nothing.

3716 2018-01-08 19:46:10 Maar... geldt dit niet voor alle crypto currencies met een beetje lage fee? Of heeft HTMLcoin iets speciaals waardoor het nog makkelijker is om (bv personeel) te betalen. Ik zie de meerwaarde niet tov andere crypto's in dit geval?
3717 2018-01-08 19:46:05 Hi, I purchased AirTokens (AIR) on Hitbtc. I am quite new in crypto. Confusion about tokens that was 1/100 of af token :-)  
3 questions;  
1 This is an ERC20 token, right?  
2 Will it forever remain as such?  
3 Since it is ERC20, I can store it om my Ledger Nano S, correct?

3826 2018-01-08 19:38:37 @ec_valouzz Tu penses que ça vaut le coup de s'amuser avec la crypto avec des sommes plus faible ? ( genre 20€ ) pour quelqu'un qui aime juste l'effet de "risque" et qui ne veut pas se mettre sur la paille x)

3833 2018-01-08 19:37:47 Agree with Btc Eth xrp and xlm but not sure about Trx even though I have some TRX.
3834 2018-01-08 19:37:38 @JoelKatz  be prepaired. Other companies will see their value rise if they partnering @Ripple 
I bet these days more companies going to ask to partner @Ripple because the added value of @Ripple 
Does @bgarlinghouse not talk about the Ripple effect? Here.... you have it! 
3835 2018-01-08 19:37:35 Managing the order size on entry and exit without pushing the market from step 20 onwards very challenging. Risk is also compouding progressively

3853 2018-01-08 19:36:46 The opportunity cost of not holding 4% or less crypto in your portfolio is tremendous. BTC's could triple it quadruple in days. However, you must also realize that 4% can go to 0.
3854 2018-01-08 19:36:43 is it to late to invest $NEBL?
3855 2018-01-08 19:36:40 your article is surfacing and is being talked about across the various crypto ppl I follow :P you officially made it! 
3856 2018-01-08 19:36:38 How high can this one go? Powder clearing tomorrow AM. This he beginning, middle or end of the run? Anything crypto could be gold
3857 2018-01-08 19:36:31 Probably, but that is why FREEDOM is great you don't have some government officials telling us how to think.  We get to think for ourselves. Overall a majority of all users are using the green logos. most wallets and exchanges will probably conform eventually.
3858 2018-01-08 19:36:17 Very true
3859 2018-01-08 19:36:17 @officialmcafee I think the crypto community has had more then enough of u buddy. Take a hint.. go away before u ruin the wronge persons life n get urself into some real trouble.
3860 2018-01-08 19:36:16 I do love Verge but $8.25 is impossible and i will tell you why, the next correction is going to happen at about $1, and you think the last one took along time, it will be at least 3weeks. The lambo kids will be cashing out as well as everyone else.
3861 2018-01-08 19:36:13 There’s no reason to sell at a high price. There’s an unlimited supply of fiat and a limited supply of bitcoin. Theres no doubt in my mind crypto is an alternative that’s purely beneficial to all but a few people at the top of the fiat pyramid.
3862 2018-01-08 19:36:08 Je t'ai posé une question sur la fermeture pour la crypto mais tu ne dois pas avoir de motivation' aussi 
3863 2018-01-08 19:36:07 OK bud, fair enough. Will check your portfolio again, maybe it's expanded since the last time I had a look. I just think we should be embracing all new alts (that are actually good), we don't want to get into the same infighting as PS4 and Xbox fanboys.

3875 2018-01-08 19:34:52 what about weeks/months? I’ve seen a few posted charts that are over months for the patterns as well as the exit being over a further few months. is it generally a more reliable pattern if it’s over months vs weeks/days or not necessarily? thanks
3876 2018-01-08 19:34:50 Folks, the only Crypto Currency I am going to invest in is our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
3877 2018-01-08 19:34:49 Wondering where SONM and APPC are 
3878 2018-01-08 19:34:28 And he can also print his own currency. Or go crypto!
3879 2018-01-08 19:34:22 I check twitter after a 6 hour break & there is panic doom & gloom in the #crypto streets. Check trading view, everything similar to where it was. $btc around $15k, $xrp $2.50 or so. Why so much panic over a little dip?
3880 2018-01-08 19:34:20 you are a fan of a "rapper with a hood image" the songs he makes are about a lot of gang shit. You should understand the culture before you try anything with him. You don't know this guys life he may have people after him who actually want to hurt him.
3881 2018-01-08 19:34:14 I'm with you. but you have to factor in 3 years were spent arguing over the blocksize... it divided the community and that was time not spent building infrastructure nor increasing the utility of crypto.

Things look much better in that regard for BCH. Merchant adoption is key.

After that it hasn’t even touched my buy price

3891 2018-01-08 19:33:35 We all make mistakes
3892 2018-01-08 19:33:33 The CMC FUD created today only adds fuel to the alt fire. $BTC dumped to 14k which means it needs to consolidate longer.

Meaning... alts are gonna fucking blow soon.

3896 2018-01-08 19:33:25 Once again, the entire crypto market will have a 10-12 trillion dollar market cap by the end of the year. Ripple will encompass about 4-5 trillion of it and be the #1 Crypto.

3904 2018-01-08 19:33:10 seems like the only crypto that actually has product backing. Everything else in crypto is an incomplete product or hopes and dreams sprinkled with fairy dust.
3905 2018-01-08 19:33:06 I have been researching crypto a little. Don't have exposure to any currencies but have bought a few stocks leveraging the block chain "technology". Got a feeling this is a huge bubble but when's it gonna burst? Fun stuff.

3907 2018-01-08 19:32:59 Xrp, fuc k u and get out. You are either with crypto or your with xrp. Don't choose the dark side.
3908 2018-01-08 19:32:54 You need to reevaluate your emotional connection to crypto.

3936 2018-01-08 19:31:02 It literally JUST got released and was in ICO phase beforehand, of course investors will take profits, will be well above that price soon enough
3937 2018-01-08 19:30:56 Mr Buffet. Do you agree that crypto currency when it’s peer to peer, open source, block chain tech that is not centralized has the power to fix some of the economic problems in this country?

3941 2018-01-08 19:30:34 Honest answer. Fair. If your looking at crypto. Keep an eye on one called raiblocks. It's about to be launched on binance so will go up 
3942 2018-01-08 19:30:27 I would be too.   Not saying it’s not possible or that no research was done but everyone seems to be a professional price prediction expert these days.  Only a few crypto analysts actually break down their numbers.  Whether right or wrong, at least it was based on numbers
3943 2018-01-08 19:30:25 Do not advise people you didn’t suffer their pain.

3967 2018-01-08 19:28:56 Its interesting that this happen in same time as South Korea drama is going on with the regulatory inspections etc. I personally thought that this idrop is caused by bad news coming from Korea and same scene will happen as happen in September (panic selling)
3968 2018-01-08 19:28:55 Hopefully after hearing todays meeting in the knesset, the banks Will Change their attitude towards crypto currency. I think that the overall message was more about legitimizing rather than forbiding.

3971 2018-01-08 19:28:41 The crypto-fest is certainly serving up some bargains among other asset classes - that's for sure.
3972 2018-01-08 19:28:38 250K SATs is the next target for sure
3973 2018-01-08 19:28:35 Wow, you're really salty about all these new alt coins aren't you. Change the record mate, it's getting boring. We should be embracing new innovative coins, not slagging them off.

3981 2018-01-08 19:28:13 Ne bu kavga jargonunu, ne de nefretten beslenen bu insanlar ile muhattap olmayi kendime yakistiriyorum. Fakat isini hakkiyla yapan bu insanlarin, herseyin yukseldigi zaman kendini uzman sanan 3-5 fenomencik tarafindan yaftalanmasina sessiz kalamiyorum.
3982 2018-01-08 19:28:13 It is quite expensive to do that on the picture, #crypto world needs to do much more on that!
3983 2018-01-08 19:28:08 Don’t buy high and sell low! Like most people chasing gains
3984 2018-01-08 19:28:06 Tinfoil dude also said 3 days ago that TRX will hit 3000 satoshi in 2 days. he's a real tin foil

3989 2018-01-08 19:27:41 In the last week or two it was falling back so easily. Very frustrating. But today it was strong. Definitely a break out coming.

3991 2018-01-08 19:27:34 I’m not sure you will find a list like that. There’s different YouTube channels. But most go on speculation. Some are very knowledgeable. Haven’t seen a list like that. Google best crypto investments and choose wisely.

3995 2018-01-08 19:27:21 You have failed to realise a fundamental importance to crypto and that’s who holds private keys. In this world you are your own bank.
3996 2018-01-08 19:27:13 For how long though?
3997 2018-01-08 19:27:12 I started investing 2 weeks ago so going to build up a portfolio.  Thanks for your posts and help.

3999 2018-01-08 19:26:53 Should I get into this whole crypto currency thing. Like is it a legit way to make money

4003 2018-01-08 19:26:41 First @tdbank and @RBC invest. platforms experienced technical difficulties last week,now I cant log into my @cibc banking.Yet people stay steady wondering why were placing investments in alternative houses such as crypto. My fellow #canadians , change is coming. #Cryptocurrency
4004 2018-01-08 19:26:31 @bensemchee 

What will be the impact on crypto when we are in another financiele crisis ??
4005 2018-01-08 19:26:24 My low-bleed 5-set portfolio at the moment: $xlm + $xrp + $appc + $???+ $btc ....the "???" slot is for whatever position you find to be one you just love and want to see win. I think that's best set up for the market right now. Spread em out! #crypto
4006 2018-01-08 19:26:18 @AirToken Hi, I purchased AirTokens (AIR) on Hitbtc. Am quite new in crypto. Confusion about tokens that was 1/100 of af token :-) 
3 questions; 
1 This is an ERC20 token, right? 
2 Will it forever remain as such? 
3 Since it is ERC20, I can store it om my Ledger Nano S, correct?
4007 2018-01-08 19:26:06 Like the look of @thebeetoken and @WePowerN but not keen on the others!
4008 2018-01-08 19:26:04 ew...
4009 2018-01-08 19:26:02 @cryptocoinewstr crazy manipulation of XDN going on at HITBTC. Not placing buys and sells to keep the price down.  Just compare the prices between exchanges then check HitBTC order books. Also locking up people’s wallets so they can’t withdraw.  Crypto will never go mainstream
4010 2018-01-08 19:25:58 Seems like market manipulation ...

4012 2018-01-08 19:25:57 First day in International Economics and already had three Wolf of Wall Street bro’s circle jerking about crypto currencies
4013 2018-01-08 19:25:52 Today has been truly awesome..  Buy, buy, buy.  Certainly need to update my portfolio now, see where things are at but it can only be good news once its all calmed down.
4014 2018-01-08 19:25:49 That's why it is very important to preserve capital.
4015 2018-01-08 19:25:41 I added some TRX to my portfolio lst night, but most of my holdings are from $0.03 and below
4016 2018-01-08 19:25:41 People can have interests but just cause im interested in something doesn’t make me an expert, Doug thinks he is because he got in at a good time he can spread information as valid. Its just so obvious how out of touch crypto investors are with the luck factor
4017 2018-01-08 19:25:37 Thanks! If you haven’t already, then consider grabbing this month’s @sciam with special focus on crypto.

4024 2018-01-08 19:25:24 Drives me crazy seeing people throwing everything at crypto, doing barely any research, without any kind of equity portfolio on the side
4025 2018-01-08 19:25:22 Is there where we, as investors, get #screwed because there is no #oversight on #crypto ?
4026 2018-01-08 19:25:19 I've re-thought this and think for newbies and people with alot invested, this is bad and we need to stick together in this crypto world. So yes CMC you need to think before you act. Ripple Holders, do consider it crashing and if you believe in it enough to keep when it does.
4027 2018-01-08 19:25:12 If I could pick a phrase to ban today, I’d pick crypto currency. Just call it anything else.

4029 2018-01-08 19:25:09 #2018Predictions
March
Might happen: #MarkZuckerberg and @ElonMusk get involved in some serious Twitter beef.
Might not happen: trust in #cryptocurrencies falls super low. A startup invents something it calls physical crypto which is literally indistinguishable from real money
4030 2018-01-08 19:25:04 @Cointelegraph crazy manipulation of XDN going on at HITBTC. Not placing buys and sells to keep the price down.

4035 2018-01-08 19:24:42 Most accountants will say don’t invest in crypto. Main reason is. They don’t know anything about it. Which is a smart answer.
4036 2018-01-08 19:24:35 That's hilarious. I sent you a tweet earlier asking where you recommend storing coins that I can't put on my Nano. Seen bad experiences with apps like coinomi. So paperwallet? For stuff like XVG...PIVX...CARDANO
4037 2018-01-08 19:24:29 I’ve decided to stop updating my portfolio, Crypto trading (as long as it lasts  ) is way more fun and lucrative. Wish you all good luck with “old school” trading.
4038 2018-01-08 19:24:16 Thanks Crypto_Toad for the follow! I´m very happy about it.

4059 2018-01-08 19:23:28 There is real value in both stocks and crypto. The market caps prove the value.

4061 2018-01-08 19:23:24 CMC is not responsible for this insane market. Anything can shake this fragile space off kilter right now

4069 2018-01-08 19:22:52 $XVG havingbtheir own debit card would be HUGE!! That being said Didn’t visa just yank all crypto cards and not tell customers leaving them high and dry????  I hope that if $xvg partners with visa they don’t pull that shit on us! $XVG

4079 2018-01-08 19:22:20 I'm very glad you are still allowing people to view the true global prices. People seem to often forget that Korea is what got Bitcoin and crypto to the level they are now - we aren't as disconnected from the Korean market as we like to think.

4081 2018-01-08 19:22:10 I'm only gonna invest in Crypto's that actually have potential to solve real world problems. What problems does Refereum solve?

4083 2018-01-08 19:22:07 According to @BenedictEvans, within a year crypto mining will use about 10 times as much energy as today, rivaling Italy's consumption and overshadowing growth of renewables. How is that sustainable?
4084 2018-01-08 19:22:06 could you tell me where to find charts that includes everything now?
4085 2018-01-08 19:22:02 why not UBQ?
4086 2018-01-08 19:22:00 You know you’ve been spoilt with crypto currencies when your profit margin dips below 100% and you get pissed off
4087 2018-01-08 19:21:57 Right! This is the mentality people should have. No ties or emotions to crypto, just chase the money.
4088 2018-01-08 19:21:49 Very confident.  Take for example stocks.  Perception of growth is driving price, but in reality growth doesn't exist.  Just p/e expansion led by leverage.    Same applies to the entire spectrum of crypto.  Perception of value although zero exists.

4095 2018-01-08 19:21:18 Stop whining, the day isn't even half over! I tweeted about how so many people in crypto are immature and impatient and you're proving to be one of them.
4096 2018-01-08 19:21:15 Hopefully I’m in ripple but lumen stellar tech is better just need better marketing team
4097 2018-01-08 19:21:15 But have a different crypto project on the horizon right now. Has been a higher priority.

0.2枚だと逆方向に大きな成行が入っただけでかなりのダメージですし。
遅れ対策として特殊注文を使わずに、注文の時点で利確指値を同時にもしくは約定と同時に入れてるのかなと勝手に想像してます
4105 2018-01-08 19:20:40 Anyone invested in Crypto?
4106 2018-01-08 19:20:39 You must appreciate your position in the crypto trading market. There are many people and applications rely on your pricing, and this unannounced change has triggered many stop losses and have caused a #flashcrash.
4107 2018-01-08 19:20:28 A government shutdown is highly unlikely. We must not forget the amount of negative attention that #bitcoin received in it's early years... drug dealers, Hitman, weapons, etc... To this day #BTC continues to be the #crypto leader. Regulations are another story in regards to #XVG

4120 2018-01-08 19:19:34 2018 is "put up or shut up" for #crypto:
$ETH needs to scale
$BTC needs a roadmap or acceptance of what it is/isn't
$IOTA needs to kill coordinator and prove secure
$XRP needs banks to use its token
Other protocols need main-nets and dev mindshare not marketing
Dapps need users

4127 2018-01-08 19:18:52 When we look back at this current mania we'll be shocked at the amount of speculation that took place towards the end of the cycle. Crypto market is worth $800B and people find ways to justify it. CBs have really pushed speculation to its maximum, whereas productivity is dying

4129 2018-01-08 19:18:45 How is a 4 year old project with no whitepaper, no roadmap, and no published development team going to be a VERY SERIOUS player in crypto trading? Have you looked at their website?

4135 2018-01-08 19:18:13 Thats the beauty of it, the FIAT black market can not be truly valued. At least crypto is transparent. 
4136 2018-01-08 19:18:11 Most people in the crypto world are immature and impatient and buy and sell coins based on rumors and FUD rather than DD #trx #verge #xvg
4137 2018-01-08 19:18:09 Anyone heard of these guys and the team ? Project makes alot of sense but looks a little suspect on the team front  #rupee #rup #crypto
4138 2018-01-08 19:18:08 Yes
4139 2018-01-08 19:18:06 This was an intentional "mistake" they knew this will happen and if people can't HODL, this is what they deserve. Crypto is at very early stages, it is the future and if new investors didn't understand this yet  they take the loss every time a dog barks.
4140 2018-01-08 19:17:53 If the crypto bubble bursts, this would be the coin standing strong like rock because its product's users are more than a million everyday. $BAT #BAT #Brave #basicattentiontoken #crypto #batcrypto #batcoin #battoken #altcoin #bitcoin #btc
4141 2018-01-08 19:17:52 It's been 9 years.  The Internet of today didn't exist 9 years ago.  Things change and grow.  I think you should define what you mean by 'application's, because they are out there.  This is still early days as far as Crypto goes.
4142 2018-01-08 19:17:46 if someone tells you to unironically invest large amounts of your savings in a crypto coin, run
4143 2018-01-08 19:17:39 Crypto News thanx for following and I wish a good discussion on #digitaltransformation #Bigdata #ehealth and #management
4144 2018-01-08 19:17:26 @CNBC  confirmed it
4145 2018-01-08 19:17:26 Is that a guess or based on TA like @nasirjones007 does?
4146 2018-01-08 19:17:21 How to be successful in $crypto

1) Learn about market cycles & trader psychology

2) Learn how to judge a project based off fundamentals before learning TA

3) When you do start TA, wait for the trend confirmation and always have a game plan

4) Find a crypto mentor  

5) 
4147 2018-01-08 19:17:19 Now its the waiting game for me. Traded all morning, just waiting for the proper dip to get back in. A lot of techs are overbought or crossing over.

4157 2018-01-08 19:16:53 Now picture people at these firms: "now what if we started to use @Ripple and #xrp for our payments ...savings ánd a higher valuation....oh and let's get a .com thingy while we're at it as well"
4158 2018-01-08 19:16:46 Thank you. Yeah gotta constantly question. Nothing is 100% safe in crypto, always gotta be on guard 
4159 2018-01-08 19:16:44 2 haftadır tatildeydim yarın kısmet olursa kapanıp araştırmalar a basliyorum. Kafamda birkaç coin var öncesinde derin bi analiz yapmam lazım. Tavsiyem benim profil in alarmını aktive edin ki anında haberiniz olsun. Etherdelta yi kullanmayı öğrenin. Metamask falan hazır olsun.
4160 2018-01-08 19:16:37 Well, it’s probably smart to classify what 90% of the people in crypto are doing as gambling. I, seeing as I know very little about it, knew it was a gamble. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ But I wouldn’t say I’m addicted. It’s just the only exciting thing I’ve done lately. Haha
4161 2018-01-08 19:16:35 wtf.. why.. who.. hae...?  
4162 2018-01-08 19:16:31 That’s not Coinbase’s job. If enough people/institutions adopt $XRP, it candidly does not matter if it’s not a true crypto

4205 2018-01-08 19:13:47 apparently no one will sell ardr
4206 2018-01-08 19:13:45 Are people really selling exchanges for bokoo bucks?  I loaded up quite a few over the last months.

4212 2018-01-08 19:13:18 Exactly. I have more than 7m Pac coins and I am not half worried as these people who are hating on it. Worst comes to worse, I lose £40. But the coin comes back up, I have thousands. Isn’t that what Crypto is about? Look at XRP bouncing back like a pro lol

4217 2018-01-08 19:12:57 So while a coin like xrp that has a real use case and real customers needs real news for it to go up, coins like iota and verge just need speculation and crypto kitties to rise.

4221 2018-01-08 19:12:48 My point exactly. When did all those people who trade crypto end up being so dependent on completely centralized services for their signals? It's so ironic.

4230 2018-01-08 19:12:30 anything from open resourcing e.g FSW, open crowdsourcing, etc that offers free tools, and unrestrained knowledge, to rebellion e.g activism, cryptocurrency, crypto, etc would definitely contribute to the collapse of capitalistic modernity.

4259 2018-01-08 19:10:25 That is literally what crypto was intended to do. Why would you slight the very technology you're supporting? Product for product, service for service, product for service with little oversight. There are still tech funds you can purchase on the NYSE if you prefer...

4271 2018-01-08 19:09:34 I’m only in $mint and $DGB at the minute ... I think they’re both strong projects.  I’m interested in Tron as you mentioned but I’m not sold on the founder. 
4272 2018-01-08 19:09:33 Sia splits apart, encrypts, and distributes your files across a  decentralized network. Since you hold the keys, you own your data. No  outside company can access or control your files, unlike traditional  cloud storage providers. #SC #Siacoin #crypto
4273 2018-01-08 19:09:28 the only crypto with a plan, we cant lose
4274 2018-01-08 19:09:28 That’s accurate, but you can’t discount today’s drop being due to the flipside of that coin. CMC pulling out Korean exchanges lost a lot of week hands. Anyway, if you’re using CMC to track crypto and not the actual exchange on TradingView you don’t belong in the space anyway
4275 2018-01-08 19:09:28 wtf is happening here lmao

4279 2018-01-08 19:09:16 The Internet of Money is a great book to learn about blockchain technology and the power of crypto!
4280 2018-01-08 19:09:15 So i tweeted earlier about the gopro call 12 jan 2019. Bought at 31 cents, now 46 cents. Hedge ur #crypto!!!
4281 2018-01-08 19:09:14 Are there any existing etf's or similar vehicle available for crypto investing?
4282 2018-01-08 19:09:09 All #Crypto is on sale today... if you aren't in yet, now is your chance. 

I first got into crypto in the early summer of 2017 when ETH dropped from ~ $320 to ~ $175.

Also noticed #LTC was cheap at ~ $18 and got into #Litecoin too.

And you all see the prices today..

I have to say; @cburniske you have been an inspiration & I appreciate your work -- Keep inspiring & never get tired!
4288 2018-01-08 19:08:51 What about $appc? Is that a good one?
4289 2018-01-08 19:08:38 Damn I never win. I have tried so hard to get crypto somehow because I can't buy with fiat in my country but to no avail.
4290 2018-01-08 19:08:36 b) competition will get working product, scaling solutions and network effect going for it
c) the same ETH that is frozen in this EUR denominated ico could not just be a hold, but a profitable bet into more liquid stuff

4296 2018-01-08 19:08:15 This is not just a cryptocurrency or digital asset, and network and Protocol. In comparison of speed and efficiency, crypto allows you to conduct transactions much faster and with less cost #VICoin #ICO #Virtonomics
4297 2018-01-08 19:08:14 #cryptocurrency #Crypto #ICOs  - question for the experts. Can an original white paper be changed even though an investor took part in the ICO on the original whitepaper issued?  Surely it is offer and acceptance?
4298 2018-01-08 19:08:12 @SatoshiLite 
Charlie, I need your help with something, I know my question might sound silly as I am just a noob in crypto industry. I tried to google the info I am looking for. Do you know if there is a way to trace original sender of the LTC from receiving address ?

4302 2018-01-08 19:08:02 I’m going to start trading crypto currency and play Candy Crush until a two sided market comes back.
4303 2018-01-08 19:07:58 Hey, do you think its okay to buy now or should i wait a bit when BTC goes up a bit near 16-17k ? 
Thank you for your work in the game love it,  but i dont master TA so i rather gather a lot of bags rather than placing more on whats gonna pump soon
4304 2018-01-08 19:07:54 You seem to forget this is crypto. We don’t want your BS Gov regulation. I wanna be in control of my own money. If you wanna be regulated go to a normal bank instead of trying to FUD stuff you obviously don’t understand!
4305 2018-01-08 19:07:52 Also soon. Be able to dump my #onion tor coin thing. Now also at like .5 btc+. All free from bitcointalk forums. Ppl can make so much money just doing signups for airdrops. #crypto is insane

4313 2018-01-08 19:07:24 Lol they family can't be family . Family doesn't ask for upfront payment . You know who sells them self before the deal ? If they have good knowledge of crypto they should make money by themselves , should not sell themselves .

4319 2018-01-08 19:07:14 I'm a XRP holder myself, and I can tell you, I'm having perfect nights. There are only a few coins out there I'd put my money in, and XRP is definitely one of them. 2018 is gonna be the year of crypto with use cases.
4320 2018-01-08 19:07:08 Ethos should be there
4321 2018-01-08 19:07:06 This year is showing us a new trend, low cap coins can catch fire at any time. Just look at #rdd,#doge,#pac. Don’t be afraid to take a flyer on something some small. There will be a lot of new investors coming the next few quarter.

4322 2018-01-08 19:07:04 The @kevinrose Show. - he's just started doing podcasts specifically about crypto and it works as a good gateway. @tferriss also interviewed @NickSzabo4 a couple of months back. Also worth listening to.
4323 2018-01-08 19:07:03 Can you pay in crypto 
4324 2018-01-08 19:06:54 Is that mill not on the 38th trade? 
4325 2018-01-08 19:06:53 Timed to perfection, while #btc was falling all these rumors just magically appeared. And after a month @coinbase finally mention that their not adding it - then - selloff. 

Open your eyes everyone banks have been upto this sort of stuff for years
4326 2018-01-08 19:06:52 Yeah he jumped in my mentions totally misinformed ... that’s scary considering his title as a crypto expert.

4329 2018-01-08 19:06:45 Day like any other in #crypto. I already forgot it. 
4330 2018-01-08 19:06:44 Imagine a $1,000+ restaurant bill, paid in crypto. I want that for my friends and I
4331 2018-01-08 19:06:43 Its truly painful watching people sell at 1 sat on @Cryptopia_NZ.. They clearly have no idea. Only positive is that I bought a ton more from the noobs.
4332 2018-01-08 19:06:34 do you have a youtube channel? Would be very interested to here a female perspective on crypto.
4333 2018-01-08 19:06:30 Hm, if you actually invest ETH (i.e. have ETH ico bankroll), there is a point to be made against it at this point. This will be illiquid for quite some time (ico late feb, tradable april?). By the time of the ico and the time the token becomes liquid a) ETH price will likely rise
4334 2018-01-08 19:06:29 Remember, my fellow Americans: any time you buy or sell crypto kitties, hash puppies, or tron dogs, that's a taxable event.

4345 2018-01-08 19:05:31 The answer of your support is not satisfying! I was told that the reason for the difference is just that you use the numbers of  #CryptoCompare.

4387 2018-01-08 19:02:41 Yeah that's the one saving grace - it's too much work for them too so hopefully they change the rules. I anticipate there will be an internal battle within gov. There will be politicians and lobbyists who are pro and anti crypto. The legacy banks will be anti crypto & silicon

4391 2018-01-08 19:02:33 All currency is just a representation of value although there is no government backing of crypto currency. The real problem will is transaction costs associated with transfer, potentially more than the $ of the gelato. That and whether it’s risen or fallen in val in last 5 mins

4395 2018-01-08 19:02:22 Not really buying this excuse. I think the sell off is because ppl have realized that the price rise over the past month was a perfectly timed pump and dump cleverly orchestrated with deceptive news and rumors. - $700m investment, coinbase, amazon, uber - meh

4400 2018-01-08 19:02:02 It will be so nice towards the $GBYTE airdrop in March... 
Only 10 $GBYTE (currently ~ .47 BTC) but 16 $BTC to get 1 $GBYTE airdropped. Go figure.
Only 1 million total supply and 600k distributed so far.
'nuff said.

4404 2018-01-08 19:01:36 For all the new #crypto traders:

Charts don't lie. Accept the fact we are in the middle of an altcoin season and the best has yet to come 

Stop dumping $ALTS everytime $BTC moves and start buying the dips instead.

It's not that hard.
4405 2018-01-08 19:01:29 God dammit
4406 2018-01-08 19:01:25 Tencent would be huuuuge!!!! Largest gaming. Ompany in the world... they own like 18% of Snapchat...  An rumor had it a while ago. They were helping them monetize more efficiently and effectively... that's the kinda big Tencent is!!

4423 2018-01-08 19:00:33 answer is simple... through full implementation of Ripple products and services, they capture value/savings/market edge that equates to more dollar signs for shareholders.

4426 2018-01-08 19:00:21 Very pleased with $ARK today. It showed real strength and stability. Didn’t fall back too much when BTC dropped. Definitely looks like the upward move is coming.
4427 2018-01-08 19:00:17 So many #cryptocurrency exchanges closed for a new users. Imagine how much money would be in crypto if they were allowed to buy some coins.

4434 2018-01-08 18:59:58 "Please don't breed" 
4435 2018-01-08 18:59:56 Theres 3.4 trillion max supply. 2.5trillion supply. Thats more than any crypto ive ever seen. Good luck.
4436 2018-01-08 18:59:50 Energy consumption on mined assets is misleading. Fiat still exponentially more demanding to maintain with electricity. Plus blockchain/crypto space is built on constant innovation. It is a problem which has been and will continue to be addressed.
4437 2018-01-08 18:59:33 I made another trade and it pushed it through.  Hope you get yours resolved.
4438 2018-01-08 18:59:31 That must be why lol or you're just overly emotional towards crypto.

4445 2018-01-08 18:58:50 For everybody who is believing in new technologies, such situations can happen from time to time. Nearly every current/new Crypto Currencies are dealing with situations like this. For me it is not a real problem, as long the developers are responding.
4446 2018-01-08 18:58:48 However those prices are only available to Korean citizens. You can only sign up for a Korean exchange if you are a Korean citizen. So literally nobody else could buy or sell crypto at those prices. Why throw off everyone else's prices?

4461 2018-01-08 18:57:12 I’ve slept so much on Crypto man...my friends are part of the Bitcoin Club at the University of Florida..told me to buy Etheirium at $17 and I didn’t buy my first
Crypto until late November...now I have 13 various coins and Up 100% on my entire portfolio 
4462 2018-01-08 18:57:08 Yes that is true.  I'm of the opinion though if secure decentralized networks fail, which is all crypto really ought to be about, then we go headlong into some sort of network empowered authoritarian mode of governance.
4463 2018-01-08 18:57:02 ive always said crypto is extremely similar to fantasy football. honestly hardly any difference, only that crypto is 24/7/365
4464 2018-01-08 18:56:57 わかりました...
4465 2018-01-08 18:56:54 Idk either but it just sent me down a crypto wormhole
4466 2018-01-08 18:56:50 The visa thing was from a singal issuer, not aimed a crypto itself.
4467 2018-01-08 18:56:47 While a lot of ppl just observe and then later call it luck... but that's another topic really.
4468 2018-01-08 18:56:46 Congratulations! Thanks for all your passion about crypto
4469 2018-01-08 18:56:42 @Noisia_nl One of the first who claimed their profile on @Viberate_com! Kudos to you guys. Hopefully this year you'll get booked over a smart contract and get paid in crypto!!
4470 2018-01-08 18:56:42 What about crypto for advanced? and btw, do you know $DENT? Their vision and idea are just amazing! I bought a lot of tokens.
4471 2018-01-08 18:56:40 It's all about crypto's hahaha
4472 2018-01-08 18:56:38 Not saying they didn't do anything (they did), but has less to do with being 'smart enough' and more to do with luck.

4484 2018-01-08 18:55:50 Same here. Picked up some DGB. They have a strong adoption strategy, and with iOS wallet on its way, this is a solid investment.

4487 2018-01-08 18:55:32 As a new trader as well, I've read everywhere not to short or use margin to trade.

All I've got is 4k USDT, and if that busts I don't have another continue to play the game.
4488 2018-01-08 18:55:31 Coinmarketcap messed up big time. Lots of people -mostly newbies- panic sold and lost money. I don’t believe that it was just to hurt #xrp #ripple $xrp though. This will be forgotten until Wednesday, as most crypto dramas are. Remember September, everyone forgot China in a week..

4501 2018-01-08 18:54:37 if you dont get it you miss the whole point of crypto. And yes, it's a shame because there are enough people in the space that would cover their project if it would be valuable. If they need to pay for it, they simply dont deserve the spotlight.

4510 2018-01-08 18:54:09 José sabes si será minada o pre minada?
4511 2018-01-08 18:54:09 Some people/orgs do accept certain crypto currency, but the main issue is that eventually you find a situation where your vendor/beneficiary doesn’t. That’s true of any currency.

This idea that crypto-currency is an inviolate panacea is one of my major mental blocks on it.
4512 2018-01-08 18:54:07 If crypto is to become a serious asset class, we will need to improve and do serious work on valuation. I think the ''granularity'' will need to be there soon, or else we fail.
4513 2018-01-08 18:53:54 I’ve given up Vegas vacations for crypto currencies

4516 2018-01-08 18:53:40 $TSLA gains like this looked great until crypto came around. It’s hard to sell tsla shares and transfer though. Need balance.
4517 2018-01-08 18:53:40 ビットコインを保有するということは、ブロックチェーンに固有のビットコインアドレスと自分の保有率を記録するということ。

4521 2018-01-08 18:53:18 Considering the demographics of crypto it makes no sense
4522 2018-01-08 18:53:12 Yeah I'm not worried about tracking gains and losses from trading. That's normal. What I'm worried about is that people will get crypto debit cards and spend crypto not thinking about capital gains and losses then get burnt by tax audits and get turned off to crypto.
4523 2018-01-08 18:52:54 You wanted a micro-dip in crypto to buy,  now's your chance.  lol
4524 2018-01-08 18:52:54 Have known this for years...and not just about crypto.
4525 2018-01-08 18:52:47 What about $Poe
4526 2018-01-08 18:52:46 In my first month and a bit in crypto, I have learned a lot and seem to be under if I had simply held. But with skin in the game I continue to improve.

Stand on the shoulders of giants gentlemen.
4527 2018-01-08 18:52:30 I get it. I kknow how it works aand I understand the crypto behind it.

It's experimental and it has a lot of problems to solve. It's still only version 0.15.1

It's also not a replacement for my credit card card or cheque account.
4528 2018-01-08 18:52:28 Spread the word of crypto! Great idea!

12th Jan@12:00am CET
11th Jan@11:00pm GMT
11th Jan@3:00pm PST
11th Jan@6:00pm EST
Full details available soon!
4538 2018-01-08 18:51:46 Right... too stupid to trade crypto but just smart enough to be a billionaire...
4539 2018-01-08 18:51:35 To be honest, its a great day for crypto, shake out was needed and this might cause the xrp herds to do a little research.
4540 2018-01-08 18:51:32 Whatever it is, it's downright sad.
4541 2018-01-08 18:51:32 With the rise of crypto I can't help but think the usual banks are polishing the brass on the titanic
4542 2018-01-08 18:51:25 Will you YouTube videos cover those strategies as well? Or just crypto hodl?
4543 2018-01-08 18:51:22 If only I knew, would have put more money into $NEBL bullish as fuck!
4544 2018-01-08 18:51:19 its dumb money coming into crypto right now. people think when they buy a cheap coin that is under 1c it has the better potential to grow much more. look at $KIN or $DCN - out of nowhere into the top on cmc.
4545 2018-01-08 18:51:17 As a contrast to what... The dearth of white males in crypto? "Old" was a useful enough qualifier for his point. White male? What metaphor does that imply?
4546 2018-01-08 18:51:03 I tried to use ether delta and it was slow + nightmare. @metamask_io is also falling apart joke. Used plenty of gas and such....still couldn't get it to move in ether delta wallet. Peaced out immediately. I'll make gains thru other means then potentially losing money b4 investing
4547 2018-01-08 18:51:03 You can go ahead keep focusing on million and billion dollar markets, XRP is targeting trillion dollar markets like banks and governments. Keep holding and forking your bitcoin tho, I can see why you don't like XRP
4548 2018-01-08 18:50:59 @Sambrooks90
4549 2018-01-08 18:50:58 #indiangoverment #CBI #POLICESTATE Dear sir crypto currency is Ben in india but many many company’s doing work in india and launch the fake currency (Indian company’s) please do something. Otherwise many poor people lost money. Bcoz these all r fake.
4550 2018-01-08 18:50:31 Also, regarding the trades, I'll be more clear about the timeframe for coins. 
Daytrading (DT) - max few days.
Shortterm (ST) - 1-2 weeks
Midterm (MT) - 1-4 months (approx)
Longterm (LT) - longer than 6 months mostly. 

$BTC #bitcoin $BTCUSD #crypto #cryptotrading
4551 2018-01-08 18:50:22 Yes, but the entire point of coinmarketcap is to provide the global average. Korea represents a large part of the crypto market, which coinmarketcap is now ignoring.
4552 2018-01-08 18:50:06 Im sure he did, but Nick is the last one that should call out anyone a disgrace for crypto....
4553 2018-01-08 18:50:04  a crypto bank potentially turning the financial industry upside down is doing exactly as you would expect... upsetting the rich and powerful. Wise up you fool
4554 2018-01-08 18:50:02 「Bitcoin-Qt(ビットコインクライアント)」と呼ばれるソフトウェアをインストールする世界中の人たちのコンピュータ・リソースによってビットコインネットワークは維持されている。
4555 2018-01-08 18:49:55 What about PRS deposits? Still not fixed?
4556 2018-01-08 18:49:46 The companies with less clear fundamentals (usually the ones aiming for far, unreachable objectives and with unrealistic expectations) are the ones that succeed in filling their pockets with gullible money.

The noise doesn't come from the solid proyects like $BAT
4557 2018-01-08 18:49:39 really hope so. Thanks for the help.
4558 2018-01-08 18:49:37 Netherlands are lucky mate  Gulden was Netherlands crypto i fink. Nice
4559 2018-01-08 18:49:37 What about $storm transactions?
4560 2018-01-08 18:49:29 Funfair
4561 2018-01-08 18:49:22 word is that yet again, a certain PAID group out of florida recommended one of our earlier picks- $SALT -based on the arbitrage play, hence the spike today. the crypto world is sometimes slow to catch on..but at least they eventually get there. better late than never! $RCN $LEND
4562 2018-01-08 18:49:20 but didn't you just pull entirely out of XRP? just my opinion but I'm surprised many crypto traders are so onboard with xrp with it being centralized control, billions of coins created out of thin air, and the team kept 60%. What's your thoughts on SUB and FUN? say thru April 18
4563 2018-01-08 18:49:16 Says the guy tying metaphorical PC knots around himself. Considering the dominance of white males in crypto I think your metaphors need work
4564 2018-01-08 18:49:13 I’d suggest a virtual conference where experts Skype in and locals watch as a group and can engage in live Q and A. I’d be happy to do a talk on crypto currency security trade offs.
4565 2018-01-08 18:49:04 Sorry for that impression we've left! That was a reply, handcrafted with love and caring. Your deposit will be processed manually very soon, and we'll report to you once it happens. Coins are safe.
4566 2018-01-08 18:49:00 lol reading all the comments. Yes it was bad comms by CMC. But if you don't like dips don't buy crypto's. If you panicked about ripple dropping then you don't really believe in it so get rid of it when\if it goes back up. I suggest not buying it at all.
4567 2018-01-08 18:48:56 @justinvendetta agree with you,  since I am a developer for 18 yrs I understand your point of view.  However if I am an investor I would take Marketing and how popular it is.  $TRX is more popular than any coin but $XVG is more technology that will change crypto in coming months.
4568 2018-01-08 18:48:55 Under the weather, trying to recoup. Will be back on Twitter with full awoken Force in the very near future, love and respect to the crypto community! Thank you
4569 2018-01-08 18:48:53 @1a I am loving this crypto show!
4570 2018-01-08 18:48:49 No need to panic..all cryptocoins are down today as a result of coin market cap removed south korean crypto prices and its adjusting now.
4571 2018-01-08 18:48:46 Crypto will be the solution to the Middle East
4572 2018-01-08 18:48:45 This  tweet would’ve been nice 24 hours ago. #foreheadslap
4573 2018-01-08 18:48:39 Quem ai se interessa por crypto?
4574 2018-01-08 18:48:36 @tanishafazal - I understand Ukrainian issue completely because I was a Russian crypto linguist in the United States Air Force. Russian language program had an 80% attrition rate - the few of us remaining at the end passed spy school during the Cold War. 206-280-4120

4577 2018-01-08 18:48:13 Avoid @hitbtc At All Costs! Crypto Funds Either Take Several Days or Never Show Up When You Transfer to The Exchange. Why People Use Them is Beyond Me.
4578 2018-01-08 18:48:05 @jimmy_crypto @UnsungOrg
4579 2018-01-08 18:47:59 I could definitely tackle the website. No problem.
4580 2018-01-08 18:47:53 Bro this is getting ridiculous. Please don’t stop this
4581 2018-01-08 18:47:52 This crypto market is just a baby just getting started so just like a baby if you bump it it can fall but gets right back up and keeps it moving wait until it becomes a teenager there’s not anyone or anything that will stop it
4582 2018-01-08 18:47:50 I've realized I'm a much as a hodler than i am as a trader.  I'm willing to give advice on when I would buy/sell, but your best bet is to do the exact opposite, and you'll likely make millions. #crypto
4583 2018-01-08 18:47:43 When #crypto prices drop all the #fud prone individuals are like "i told you so." But when prices are going up or remain somewhat steady,then it's a "gamble". At the end of the day, IT'S MY MONEY, ill do whatever the hell i want with it. #smh #cryptostrong
4584 2018-01-08 18:47:40 Thanks bud
4585 2018-01-08 18:47:35 People don't understand the difference I think...
4586 2018-01-08 18:47:30 Haven’t been able to register for a week :(
4587 2018-01-08 18:47:26 a possible scenario which is still possible?
yeah that sounds fair enough, else it would be an impossible scenario init Ed?
gotta agree on you, im likely to say this is whats going to happen
4588 2018-01-08 18:47:20 @fold_app  What She's replayin' : Tried to use your anon feature today : Sent #Bitcoin : Confirmed on Blockchain : Never showed up on Starbucks QR Code : How can I get a refund until you get this working? Thanks : #crypto
4589 2018-01-08 18:47:16 Very exciting . I bought the dip

4602 2018-01-08 18:46:09 Everyone needs to chill out on  @CoinMarketCap yes they messed up, but I have a hard time believing it was intentional and that they could have predicted it would do what it did. #crypto is still young and working out the kinks @coindesk @Cointelegraph #XRP #tron #trx $trx
4603 2018-01-08 18:46:05 @CoinMarketCap  the crypto community need an apology #CoinMarketCapSaySorry

4609 2018-01-08 18:45:27 You seem to be knowledgeable about crypto currency. Can you please tell me how to dump and ICO when it launches? I have purchased a few by ICO and I have never done this before. Thank you
4610 2018-01-08 18:45:25 Never, never would have thought that could happen with a CRYPTO
4611 2018-01-08 18:45:22 Lol, this guy. FUDing $XVG with his $100,- worth of coins. Don't even listen to him. #newbie
4612 2018-01-08 18:45:17 Yeah get fucked Ver........
4613 2018-01-08 18:44:59 I can't take you and this crypto thing seriously.
4614 2018-01-08 18:44:58 Crypto is going to gain MA, regardless. It's at a point of no return, unless the world flat out rejects it. And I don't see that happening. 3/
4615 2018-01-08 18:44:51 So why'd you ask how?
4616 2018-01-08 18:44:51 Thoughts on Sia coin?
4617 2018-01-08 18:44:39 Bleutrade is fine. Also, #htmlcoin  has it's own wallet. You can always transfer it to your own wallet.
4618 2018-01-08 18:44:37 what about $ICX?
4619 2018-01-08 18:44:33 We aren't inventing any new crypto. There is no PFS standard for e-mail messages. However, the transport layer can and should use TLS which supports PFS with the appropriate ciphers.
4620 2018-01-08 18:44:29 what about $mtl , kinda flopped
4621 2018-01-08 18:44:25 That does it... Not coming to ottawa to work Crypto things I had planned.
4622 2018-01-08 18:44:25 #betterbetting
Introducing BETR - the betting crypto-currency that will establish truly decentralized sports betting on the internet. Providing a Global Betting Liquidity Pool, BETR is being built by gaming industry veterans, for the industry. #betterbetting #ICO
4623 2018-01-08 18:44:14 Over the last two years my twitter feed has been consumed by #Crypto people. These people are sharp, but disagree and argue constantly. So when they ALL line up like its the Care Bear Stare to shout down $XRP in unison...pay some f'n attention.
4624 2018-01-08 18:44:14 The only sure thing about crypto headlines is that they are out of date ... lol
4625 2018-01-08 18:44:09 So Crypto Burst is pumping on Binance today! Pump in 17 min!
4626 2018-01-08 18:44:04 Nearly there already, thanks for the advise
4627 2018-01-08 18:43:59 You must be slow ! They feel sorry for you cause of your lack of intelligence and research . Good luck to you !
4628 2018-01-08 18:43:51 At the same time, there are those that don't want to legitimize crypto. And you have to elevate it to certain levels of that legitimacy to be able to expect a certain value to be extracted as taxation. 2/
4629 2018-01-08 18:43:48 Ripple has no value. Even the CEO Bradley knows it. This coin is inflated. Most of the money behind is based on dumb asses who don’t even understand the concept of crypto. Coins are valuable if they are mined, not printed infinitely like paper money. Ride the rumor waves...
4630 2018-01-08 18:43:42 まじやで
4631 2018-01-08 18:43:40 I don't know why I didn't bought $STRAT earlier. This coin have so much news in January! Thanks @coinmarketcal for the hints !
4632 2018-01-08 18:43:38 I just got my car egged overnight lmao, I guess the Crypto Revolution makes people go crazy?!!!  LMAO!
4633 2018-01-08 18:43:35 "let them eat crypto"
4634 2018-01-08 18:43:29 Buy reddcoin $rdd #rdd invest now. Dont ignore the new market or you will be left behind. Also i like the Ymca and a good crypto portfolio could keep it running eternally.
4635 2018-01-08 18:43:27 Holding in the stock market = Easy

Hodling in crypto = Holly shit
4636 2018-01-08 18:43:26 maybe the tell is when a college bowl game/NFL stadium is named after a crypto

4639 2018-01-08 18:43:14 How is BNB (Binance Coin) not there?
Binance r doing a ~$9 billion per day trading with default fee in Binance coin for 0.05%

This is approx. $4million profit per day! Surely BNB gonna rocket once financials are out!
4640 2018-01-08 18:43:13 This is not a sell-off wait for the demise - no explanation needed. Then wake me up when Crypto 2.0 is establish in the post distress era.
4641 2018-01-08 18:43:12 Guys keep calm on his last Live stream. Was great,no bullshit selling- has even proven some nice humor  if you are able to read between the lines. Justin is currently the most authentic Crypto Guy on the planet. The same authentic as his Live Stream was. Big respect ! Great Dude
4642 2018-01-08 18:43:11 Thats why good for short term;)
4643 2018-01-08 18:43:11 looks like my crypto 
4644 2018-01-08 18:43:10 It want his day
4645 2018-01-08 18:43:09 Well, there are currently a lot of people regreting today that they did not bought shitloads of bitcoin or ethereum when it cost a handful of dollar cents, me included :D but we should look forward my friend

4648 2018-01-08 18:43:08 no OST??
4649 2018-01-08 18:43:08 More I think about it more I believe CB will add $xrp in near future. CB is not adding coins with ideology of crypto community. They are a for profit business that wants volume/fees & xrp with all the media attention is the #1 coin consumers want.
4650 2018-01-08 18:43:08 I’d like to see a chart of any other crypto that took a 10x jump and held there. Other than that, the pullback off a moment in 2000 sats should be expected. 1000 is really a great place to be a week later.
4651 2018-01-08 18:43:02 Yoooo actually been thinking about that too
4652 2018-01-08 18:43:00 Scared money is selling today.

4653 2018-01-08 18:42:49 Big whale crypto traders are like: Crypto is the goose with the olden eggs! Can't cut the goose open. But goose  is very sick. Goose might die anyway. And the eggs are not gold at all,  they are being sold as if they where gold but that is something  completely different.
4654 2018-01-08 18:42:44 how is this not arbitraged away by now? Is it that major banks don't have worldwide crypto desks yet?
4655 2018-01-08 18:42:43 I thought it was with me or when not happens, and then that's that and  immediately ask what do do with it all what I learned today, I will use  and recommend to all! #ICO #P2PSF #Crypto #Altcoin #Blockchain

4658 2018-01-08 18:42:29 No idea if its related, but I sent them a long DM yesterday complaining about korean markets messing with every android crypto portfolio app, since the prices in my app dont match what I could actually sell my coins for in USD.

4663 2018-01-08 18:42:14 This crypto business is crazy
4664 2018-01-08 18:42:13 With upcoming #Olympics and #WorldCup in 2018 targeting a massive global market it sure would be nice to see some crypto sponsored ads help promote synergy  @SatoshiLite $LTC $BTC $ETH $TRX $ETN $PIVX $NEO $DRGN $DGB $ADA $MSP $XRP $QTUM
4665 2018-01-08 18:42:10 Ripple is garbage. NAV Coin is the hidden King of Crypto
4666 2018-01-08 18:42:09 $SUB is a must have on your portfolio on an era of censorship.

Filled my pockets with it at 15900 sat with it.

Wait until the Koreans and Japanese start hearing about it and jump on it.

4668 2018-01-08 18:41:52 I think we need a crypto currency lending mechanism so people can borrow and bet against the more egregious plays and provide some structure to the markets. Short sellers do have a purpose!

4672 2018-01-08 18:41:39 @RevolutApp Hi, when will I be able to transfer crypto out of the revolut ecosystem?
4673 2018-01-08 18:41:34 @RyanRossFL is a crypto-friendly politician that thinks you know the best way to spend your money. 

I don't know his whole platform. But check him out. Especially if you're in Florida.
4674 2018-01-08 18:41:30 @naval Heard your podcast with Nick for the 2nd time today and it goes a lot along the lines of discussions I’ve had with friends.

Do you have any recommendations for something similar with the disruptive economic/political/cultural/psychological aspect of a future with crypto?
4675 2018-01-08 18:41:21 even cimb bank are joining in crypto. 2018 will be the year malaysia finally join.
4676 2018-01-08 18:41:20 I would say I'm charitable in nature, been teaching my friends and family through presentations about bitcoin. Before crypto I spent time mentoring younger girls in the inner city
4677 2018-01-08 18:41:14 Hey guys. Can you do a review/video on initial thoughts of APPCoin . New to coin market cap. Looks promising. Thx !

4680 2018-01-08 18:40:56 A scenario to consider is a rogue state wanting to destabilise finance. Would an attack have lasting effects, e.g by creating side effects that avalanche, or would it be very temporary? If the latter then it is probably not worth doing.
4681 2018-01-08 18:40:55 I’ll give you a free piece of advice. Follow all big crypto youtubers and tweeters...100k subs+ turn on notifications and when they predict a coin to moonshot buy that within 10minutes and watch your money skyrocket. To be safe cash out half once you’ve 10x’d. Easy money.
4682 2018-01-08 18:40:54 Good coin.. keep it the next 2/2.5 weeks and than profit

4685 2018-01-08 18:40:45 Lmao, $xvg is rebrandet dogecoin dark. It's only feature is tor integration and the removed radio, but setting up tor yourself separately is safer, because it can be updated faster. $xmr is the only real privacycoin that you need!
4686 2018-01-08 18:40:40 True. I think these guys are too big.
4687 2018-01-08 18:40:40 I recommend taking a look at @gems

A very promising project in the crypto space 


4688 2018-01-08 18:40:31 Most of Sneaker Twitter too poor to buy crypto. What makes you think you can buy 1 BTC and hold it when you can’t even hold a $200 shoe?
4689 2018-01-08 18:40:27 If you’re into crypto, and want a good return within a year, buy $BAT, Basic attention token. You won’t regret it.

4691 2018-01-08 18:40:24 Is the Committee planning any hearings on crypto currencies?
4692 2018-01-08 18:40:23 This is one of the at least twenty reasons why the kids are running crypto, or guys who know very little about financial stuff. They may be savant coders but underneath the shiny code the market is a joke. More OTC pink sheets than Nasdaq.
4693 2018-01-08 18:40:20 「ブロックチェーン」はあくまで「分散台帳を実現する技術」であり、それをビットコインが使用しているに過ぎない。

4735 2018-01-08 18:38:17 I think his worldview is caught up in “crypto-currency is an investment,” (and charities can and do invest) and he just misses the fact that it would directly benefit him. Or he willfully ignores it.
4736 2018-01-08 18:38:13 Most of the time its not hard work. Some of the time its not even smart work. A lot of the time, its being at the right place at the right time.

4748 2018-01-08 18:37:30 Hill I will die on: "cryptocurrencies" should not be abbreviated as "crypto" or "cryptos".  Either it will remain funny money, or it will just become "currency".  And saying "crypto" confuses all the other important uses of cryptography
4749 2018-01-08 18:37:24 I'm not disagreeing with you.  Its tough.  I travel often to speak at conferences.  But anytime I am speaking to an audience it is very thoughtfully planned out.  I don't shoot from the hip.  That is what the live announcement/update was.

4760 2018-01-08 18:36:52 It's hard to invest in some #cryptocurrency and don't loose. Let's look at coinmarketcap. I don't even recognize most of today's hit cryptos. I don't think most people who mined #bitcoin on 2010 have hodl them for previous 2017 year. Maybe it time for rely on old giants like #eth

4765 2018-01-08 18:36:37 Not just Ripple, they tanked the whole crypto space by 10%+ overnight without warning and caused the whole market to panic sell by removing Korean exchanges.

4772 2018-01-08 18:36:19 to assume that anymore than 5% of the people currently in #crypto actually use currencies in a poor assumption. all people are doing is trading "tokens" on exchanges and waiting for the next coin to "moon". i think either fork dying off would not be beneficial for the space

4789 2018-01-08 18:34:55 I think it might have been because the prices they showed in USD were sometimes over 20% higher than any actual coin/USD market price.

4800 2018-01-08 18:34:28 Haha self awareness is good in crypto
4801 2018-01-08 18:34:27 If anyone was wishing for a time machine to get on crypto currency you need to buy NOW!
4802 2018-01-08 18:34:25 A sure sign crypto prices will fall like a weak king.  Down big today.
4803 2018-01-08 18:34:24 I’m pretty sure a 3rd party advisor/expert isn’t what decentralized crypto was solving for. I fail to see how, say, a CPA you hire for help violate any sort of principles if the underlying system doesn’t require them but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
4804 2018-01-08 18:34:22 u think its the good time to go in?
4805 2018-01-08 18:34:11 It's gonna be the new thing, cyber was replaced by spider, we gotta do the same thing for crypto

4809 2018-01-08 18:34:07 Today is one of those days in #crypto #cryptocurrency where it will take a while to recover. The market conditions along with some recent FUD plus the Coinbase news, and Coinmarket Cap removing coin exchanges from their price calculations is what has caused these huge drops.
4810 2018-01-08 18:34:07 Do some research man. XVG is one of the only alt coins that’s different. Take another look.
4811 2018-01-08 18:34:03 That’s the problem with a crypto. They are so volitile. Definitely not a long term thing, for me it’s more of a fun extra thing to do.
4812 2018-01-08 18:34:03 Sold half of some then held - up on the day 
4813 2018-01-08 18:34:02 You have some time left. I'm up only about 40% and expecting at least 1000
4814 2018-01-08 18:34:00 Were would you rank them compared to other coins, i see you guys pushing hard for Zclassic fork/BTCPrivate....were does PART stand in all this?  Have you guys added to your position since videos PART for investors or still waiting and see approach?

4829 2018-01-08 18:32:59 Imagine spending 40 years working at a company, 9-5, you feel proud to save a few mil. Then some kids in his basement put a few thousand dollars in crypto and 6 months later, they are worth a few hundred million.

4831 2018-01-08 18:32:54 Seeing how every other #crypto has a ticker symbol with an X in it, I'm mildly surprised that none of our fine pornographic or extreme sports coins claimed $XXX yet.
4832 2018-01-08 18:32:51 @hitbtc Hi, Can you please look into Ticket ID #165392? I have deposited XRP into my account but my tag change after I sent it there. Can you please let me know what can I do now? This is almost all my money in crypto world (Sad but true)
4833 2018-01-08 18:32:51 Man I wish...
4834 2018-01-08 18:32:50 either way, this seems silly to argue over.  we can all hopefully agree that it's ridiculous the way stock markets have been reacting to crypto hype.  GLTUA
4835 2018-01-08 18:32:49 @argoexp from a chatroom - Reloaded some Ethereum this morning on a crypto bounce.  we shall see how it all plays

4840 2018-01-08 18:32:36 Lite coin is dope. TRX with its ambition and execution of plans has a very promising future.    1 “coin”    ##(none of these are coins coins are gold and silver wtf) is about $300  and the other token  $.20- If you believe in crypto future overall, then in TRX we trust 
4841 2018-01-08 18:32:35 Precies
4842 2018-01-08 18:32:26 Na
4843 2018-01-08 18:32:24 You should really reach out to the crypto communities if you haven't. I agree it is still pretty speculative but I'm optimistic about it.
4844 2018-01-08 18:32:23 I know, unfortunately true. Bitcoin and crypto currencies are complex and pump and dumpers can take advantage of that by spreading misinformation that will be accepted relatively easily
4845 2018-01-08 18:32:22 @MoneyGirl24 give crypto time to roll out. You can pay in crypto today. Just not everywhere. If not btc it will be other cryptos

4855 2018-01-08 18:31:55 CMC dropped Korean exchanges from it's weighted ave price calc. Pricing in Korea for crypto is roughly +30% hence the panic selloff.

4862 2018-01-08 18:31:36 We all should play safe here as we cannot predict the future mate. To diversify it is a way to reduce risk

4878 2018-01-08 18:30:51 He is too stupid to trade crypto
4879 2018-01-08 18:30:50 So instead of developing their projects - devs are now forking it and giving "free coins" to holders.  Basically a pump and dump scheme that crypto community embrace happily / mostly leaving newcomers wondering why NXT or ZCL and other SPREAD lost 80% of their value overnight.
4880 2018-01-08 18:30:46 It appears #Ethereum wallet is down due to #Maintenance, this could be due to a #fork in the #Blockchain, or other factor(s).
#Crypto
#CryptoCurrencies
#IoT
4881 2018-01-08 18:30:41 Very true. Case in point the orchestrated sophisticated pump and dump that occurred during the last couple of weeks  of 2017. Dumb money was excited upon the news that #xrp was to be added to #coinbase, only to be told 'weeks' later by @coinbase 'btw the rumors are wrong.
4882 2018-01-08 18:30:40 nice picks !!
4883 2018-01-08 18:30:40 $TNB too
4884 2018-01-08 18:30:38 #xrp is now the most boring debate in crypto jeezus get over your selves. If you didnt expect existing financial institutions and payment protocols to implement blockchain youre dreamin. If youre against #xrp from your high and mighty ethical soapbox then wow: don't buy it
4885 2018-01-08 18:30:35 If it just would be that easy xD
4886 2018-01-08 18:30:27 #hitbtc announced that the price of #Ethereum transfer has increased a lot. Forget about ETH, use #bch to transfer in and out Hitbtc. It s very fast and not expensive. #cryptocurrency #crypto #BTC #Bitcoin #altcoin #cointransfer #cryptocurrencynews #cryptocrash

4892 2018-01-08 18:30:09 Ponzi (a centralized entity) paid out large and guaranteed interests to ensure everybody feels like a winner.

In crypto, prices are determined by markets and there are winners and losers. Uninformed people just see the current gains and ignore the risk.

4898 2018-01-08 18:29:54 I'm so thankful I'm not new to crypto because this would be pretty confusing lol. Thanks to all the noobs for their donations.
4899 2018-01-08 18:29:45 You know your crypto company is legit when you dont jam a token/ coin into your business model... @coinbase, @LedgerHQ, @infura_io, etc are a few examples.
4900 2018-01-08 18:29:44 Blockchain will live on and be used . Bill Gates spoke about Blockchain. Bitcoin and all the other crypto currencies are a crap shoot
4901 2018-01-08 18:29:37 Lets see who updates CasinoCoin, $CSC, first. @BitScreener or at @CoinMarketCap. That's where I'll send new investors when they enter the market. We need up to date information, it's not fair to people who are new to Crypto. Lets educate everyone with the proper information!
4902 2018-01-08 18:29:34 Haha...amature hour @CNN . Who do you have working there as your crypto "expert"?

4917 2018-01-08 18:28:44 This is not okay, crypto is not national, it is international and should be treated as such. You can’t just change the rules and have millions of people effected by it and think everything is going to be okay, you lost alit of people’s faith and will never gain it back.

4924 2018-01-08 18:28:09 if ppl understood this concept, that exponential growth is better than making $ over night , then the idea of getting rich overnight from shitcoins would die and ppl would invest in real tech (btc) for long term earnings growth. thats how you become a millionaire

4932 2018-01-08 18:27:17 Love that these bitcoin crypto guys simultaneously argue that BTC is both money and not money.
4933 2018-01-08 18:27:10 No Ada?
4934 2018-01-08 18:27:07 I use something called the RSI indicator which measures the buying and selling volumes of a crypto. It's a chart that ranges from 0-100. Key levels are as follows: 30 means it is oversold, 70 means its overbought. 50 is when buying/selling cancels each other out. PM for more info
4935 2018-01-08 18:27:07 in the grim darkness of the far future, there is only crypto.
4936 2018-01-08 18:26:59 All the same my friends

4938 2018-01-08 18:26:45 I'm not dumping it.  I still believe in the project but believe professionalism and being prepared is important when speaking to your investors and supporters.  Is that wrong?
4939 2018-01-08 18:26:45 Crypto will create the most millionaires the fastest in any other industry. This is something we have never seen before. Embrace the opportunity and take full advantage of it. It can set up for retirement very early.
4940 2018-01-08 18:26:40 So how is the "xrp smear campaign" anything at all like what u said? Also I don't smear campaign, & I own some, but I also think xrp is ultimately not a good thing for crypto.
4941 2018-01-08 18:26:34 Thanks for giving me the low-down on crypto currency. Now get the fuck away from me you creep.

4965 2018-01-08 18:25:18 If you’re somehow unaware of what dogeCoin is it’s the equivalent of a joke candidate in the crypto currency space, it’s commentary on the concept of a crypto currency in general
4966 2018-01-08 18:25:15 Here, here I completely agree..when Ripple started to REALLY shine mainstream and it had went over half the market cap of bitcoin the first week of the year..look what happens the 2nd week...i personally am PISSED Ripple was the reason I got into crypto..
4967 2018-01-08 18:25:06 Yeah true. Trx and xrp have to moon so i can pay of my loan for my crypto investments!! Really important!!! xD
4968 2018-01-08 18:25:06 @SatoshiLite
Hi, 
A fan here. In my crypto portfolio diversification, one repetitive issue comes to mind, converting LTC to BTC/Eth to then trade. When will we have more coins paired with LTC? Is there a specific road map put forth or highlighted efforts by your team? 
Thank you
4969 2018-01-08 18:25:06 The biggest risk in the short term are all these fools thinking that the partnership announcement this week is going to be Alibaba. In all reality, best case it’s someone like Zynga or Bizzard Activision.

4980 2018-01-08 18:24:23 I got what your saying ... crazy to see your “baby” a former dream , actually affect such large companies
4981 2018-01-08 18:24:21 I don't think it's about the calls, It's about the altcoins market exploding... right after they got quoted, or soon after..., like Warren Buffet says, everybody is a genius on a bull market.
4982 2018-01-08 18:24:19 
4983 2018-01-08 18:24:18 Once I get settled on my first base later this year I can't wait to learn all things crypto from you my man
4984 2018-01-08 18:24:17 Makes me wish I had taken on much more risk in this recent bull run in alts... every single trade has been 60% plus, all but one have been at least 100% gains. I played it safe and diversified when I should have gone all in
4985 2018-01-08 18:24:11 also because etc does exactly the same thing as eth and it is 30 times cheaper
4986 2018-01-08 18:24:10 So start w $1,000 go all in and never sell for under a 20% gain 40 times for million

4994 2018-01-08 18:23:35 I have a relatively small investment... I've learned that #hodl is by far the best course of action
4995 2018-01-08 18:23:35 Indeed. How many grifters do you know that show their work in juried art shows & festivals? The real grifters are the crews that litter the interwebs harassing & doxxing for dollars & crypto-coins.

5000 2018-01-08 18:23:17 Ok because i checked etherscan and i saw that it was still sitting in the Cryptopia wallet thanks ill make a ticket
5001 2018-01-08 18:23:14 My suggestion; a non-profit website where users donate crypto, somebody who knows what they're doing can diversity in a few coins, send the profits onto the chosen charities (like dividends) and everyone is a winner. If that exists, great. If not, someone should make it.
5002 2018-01-08 18:23:12 LIFE coin up over 200% today, with it's total supply and future I still see this coin is heavily undervalued. Watch this space. #HODL #Cryptocurrency #LIFEcoin #MOONRIDE

5005 2018-01-08 18:22:40 Or crypto-fighter. Crypto-kitties but for a Street Fighter type video game. You can breed and sell different fighters and import them into the game.
5006 2018-01-08 18:22:37 You thought gamers were nerds with 3 monitors. What about stock/crypto traders with 5 or 6?
5007 2018-01-08 18:22:37 lol shut up by his own ignorance
5008 2018-01-08 18:22:34 If you’re looking for some future coins to cover, I would suggest doing one on Substratum. They’re trying to make hosting websites decentralized! It’s just pretty cool imo and I would love to hear ur opinion on the project.
5009 2018-01-08 18:22:32 Not a risk, it’s done amazing without coinbase. But keep hating 
5010 2018-01-08 18:22:29 $eng huge buy wall !!! next wave again
5011 2018-01-08 18:22:29 LOL  , Ripple $XRP is massively undervalued as a long term investment. The transaction speed alone will make it dominant.  At least until the economic elites panic and try to sink crypto (other than their own) with endless laws, taxes, etc
5012 2018-01-08 18:22:27 uncomfortable questions can't be asked?
5013 2018-01-08 18:22:26 @techinsider_sv Hi Sam, wanting to sign up to your Crypto extreme thing but concerned that Bittrex is not taking new registrations and Poloniex will apparently take weeks to verify. What exchange to use prior to signing up with you?
5014 2018-01-08 18:22:21 The $crypto market lost 100 Billion USD overnight due to what is best described as a typo on a webpage. 

To recent joiners: Welcome to the party folks.
5015 2018-01-08 18:22:19 Geez defensive much?  I never said someone from eth like u was a btc maximalist.  Im saying on crypto twitter btc maximalists (not you) tagged xrp as trying to have a use case that it never presented itself, and everyone (like you) ran with it.
5016 2018-01-08 18:22:18 Turns out coin market cap webpage is a centralized force in crypto

Made the whole market bleed just by excluding korean exchanges out of the price equation

Funny
5017 2018-01-08 18:22:17 On a day like today when almost all my bags are in the red, my portfolio is still up because of a few bags & great buys! #Crypto #Altcoins #Bitcoin #DNA #ST #STRAT #UBQ
5018 2018-01-08 18:22:16 It’s missing taxes. Government wants their cut for letting you take risks with money you previously earned and paid taxes on already
5019 2018-01-08 18:22:12 I see #btc #bitcoin finding support somewhere just below 13K, zoomed out it's really quite healthy and natural looking, but don't tell someone that wants to hold for longer than a week that #crypto

5022 2018-01-08 18:21:49 tbh idc much about coinbase, still im pretty sure it's going in there
5023 2018-01-08 18:21:44 I must admit, the cryptomarket is crazy. 99.9% of the people buy coins they don t even know. But who cares? They are pushing the prices up Play with the market, not against it!  #crypto #CryptoNews #cryptocurrencies #insane #crazy #cryptocurrency #CryptoNews #BTC

5031 2018-01-08 18:21:14 Nice post. Not sure why trx and vrg are fighting each other. They are 2 different types of coins that dont comoete with each other. I Hodl both. The 2 communities should actually work together to topple Ripple. :D
5032 2018-01-08 18:21:11 Banks have a role but no longer as gatekeepers, #CRDZ disintermediating a #Banks regulatory tenure. #Unregulated business #nodes coming soon and paradoxically with jurisdictional #compliance, while remaining true to #Crypto tenets #decentralisedgovernance, and transaction privacy

5035 2018-01-08 18:20:59 The crypto market needs to mature and establish itself before big banks and gov. start slapping down heavy regulations... same with hemp CBD vs. big pharma.

5043 2018-01-08 18:20:26 So, lots of FUD on $TRX the last few days. That's fine, it's making it really easy to pick up some cheap coins in the dip to grow my bag a bit more. ;) Where's that FOMO, folks? #TRON is going to be a player in 2018, get in now before we see the swing! #cryptocurrency #Crypto
5044 2018-01-08 18:20:21 Crypto, yes. But I think bitcoin itself is gonna tank and something else will rise to replace it
5045 2018-01-08 18:20:20 @patric_swiss Are you okay with this?
5046 2018-01-08 18:20:15 Yea. It dipped today and dumbbell low market cap.

5057 2018-01-08 18:19:43 Indeed. A day like today is a great one to reposition yourself in a coin. Trading today has seen around 25% more XVG with buy/sell on small percentages as I start to build it for the monster push it’ll make very soon .
5058 2018-01-08 18:19:39 I don’t know why you would. Crypto is still in its infancy.

5067 2018-01-08 18:19:20 A month ago I still thought "trading crypto" meant buying and selling the big 3 vs USD.

5073 2018-01-08 18:19:11 Their only answer is "centralized", my answer is the market obviously doesn't care and neither does coinbase. But stupidity persists and purists will pound on the table long after the tables been sold

In crypto world there is a lot of pump n dump and whales and just manipulation of the markets. Does this make the TA less reliable?

5108 2018-01-08 18:16:49 People will sell you that as store of value and foundation of crypto driving the whole capitalization, but the more you look closely and the more BTC dominance falls, the more you will realize it's just price following volume following global marketcap that gives BTC movements.

ripple just wants to move money across borders for banks and namely asian banks to start.  Thats it.

5121 2018-01-08 18:16:21 @Changelly_team I traded litecoin for bitcoin yesterday and it's still not come through. How long roughly will it be? Crypto should never take this long!!
5122 2018-01-08 18:16:12 Will probably list as BKC (BetKit Coin). In 2018, media will pivot to crypto.
5123 2018-01-08 18:16:08 Who doesn't want to keep their crypto and get cash?! Investors are finally starting to wake up! 
5124 2018-01-08 18:15:55 Although, if you are cashing out...  USD is good for some people.  I know I have had to tell friends who were, "We are way ahead with their crypto vs. USD..." then to explain, well if you left it as BTC you would be better off.
5125 2018-01-08 18:15:55 100 JPY(BTC): 1316.593 ~ 1318.593 KRW(BTC)
5126 2018-01-08 18:15:47 Thank God many of you have insane gains in followers. It certainly looks like it's just the beginning for crypto. I'm day trading less and tweeting less cuz my alt bags are mooning left and right, sorry.
5127 2018-01-08 18:15:37 世知辛いのじゃ
5128 2018-01-08 18:15:31 the market all crypto currency will explode this week. I believe, why? because the bitcoin will touch the 10000 ~ 9000 !! good luck to everyone

5134 2018-01-08 18:15:05 BTC is just, as long as crypto alts are traded mostly in BTC pairs, just a function of the global coin market cap curve. Think about it... There's no more any intrinsic dynamic driving BTC except Bitcoin cash fud and take over attempts.
5135 2018-01-08 18:14:50 40 trades in a row with 20% of gain on each, it is almost sci-fi
5136 2018-01-08 18:14:44 The biggest problem in crypto is market manipulation / greed. It will hurt the market if these things aren’t addressed by the community.

5152 2018-01-08 18:13:37 HODL’d but didn’t BTFD, because completely in alts. No btc left to buy the dips.
5153 2018-01-08 18:13:35 Come on man, buying crypto currency with other crypto is not what I was talking about and you know it.
5154 2018-01-08 18:13:31 I guess it's because something that was just and idea and two or three guys working on it five years ago is now affecting the valuations of corporations like Western Union and Seagate.

5159 2018-01-08 18:13:07 Coin Market Cap dropped the whole market place by excluding the Korean exchanges from their calculations. Coins there are more expensive hence a steep drop in the average price causing a sell panic. #crypto #cryptocurrency #coin $xrb $BTC #doge #ETH

5166 2018-01-08 18:12:20 You are an amazing contributor to the crypto community!!!  Thanks so much for all you do.
5167 2018-01-08 18:12:19 Salut khey et jolie pour tes calls. Que pense-tu de la situation envers le btc ? Retour au 13K ou tu pense qu'il va redemarrer ? Car pas facile de trade sur les alt avec un btc aussi instable en ce moment.
5168 2018-01-08 18:12:17 Already sold and got out of crypto.  It had it's time and now I suspect there will be a prolonged period where ltc goes between 230 and 295 bouncing around doing nothing.

5176 2018-01-08 18:11:34 Thanks for shaking out the weak hands from the crypto tree.  But still, the handling was dubious at best.
5177 2018-01-08 18:11:33 This project seems to be fruitful and promising with a lot of potential. The use of blockchain technology is not only good for facilitating and maintaining records of conversations, but also for allowing easy flow of fiat and crypto money between people.
5178 2018-01-08 18:11:30 Just don’t bring any type of wallet and card holder and just pay in crypto
5179 2018-01-08 18:11:28 It looks easy on paper but once someone turns that 1000$ into something life changing for them say 100,000 or 500,000 , they most likely won’t be willing to reinvest in all again.  Emotions play a big role, but if they can avoid that then millions they will make
5180 2018-01-08 18:11:16 That's just stupid lol... people making millions from thousands it's a beautiful day for crypto lol
5181 2018-01-08 18:11:07 $POT been sitting between $.30-$.40 range. On next move we see $0.80-$1.20. I see this price move over the next thirty days. By year end this will be a $3+ coin easy! #Crypto #Cannabis

5188 2018-01-08 18:10:49 It's amazing the way that institutions have to try to cut #BTC from growing. Maybe it's time to stop giving money to huge energy companies and start to invest on 100% clean energy. But nah! Business is business

5236 2018-01-08 18:07:38 A thought: Why try to balance risk from within crypto, instead of allocating N% of your portfolio to bonds, and then investing in the riskiest crypto you can find? Seems like this would have higher sharpe/sortino ratio due to lower correlation between bonds and crypto as a whole?

5263 2018-01-08 18:05:54 I have some people who are very confident in crypto funding my ventures (giving them 50% profit atm). My personal money is still primarily in USD.
5264 2018-01-08 18:05:52 You do realise dogecoin is one of the biggest fail in Crypto. Sounds more DODGY coin if you ask me.
I have noticed a trend. Something starts flying and then its automatically coin of the week. So im guessing next might be #digibyte or #OMG ? Both were flying this week somehow..
5265 2018-01-08 18:05:51 What is this mean ?
5266 2018-01-08 18:05:51 Easily the best investment I've made in crypto.

5268 2018-01-08 18:05:48 John McAfee is a horrible representation of the imbalance within crypto. He has openly admitted that all of his "coin of the week" segments are paid advertising from the Company's. These aren't even his true beliefs. #Smh
5269 2018-01-08 18:05:47 Perhaps some shop owner invested heavily into DGB and put this sign up, hoping for a pump. I try not to be cynical, but unfortunately, it is a requirement in the crypto market.

5280 2018-01-08 18:04:59 And you also read that they can add ANY coin outside of their criteria at their discretion right? Or did you just stop reading after the first paragraph?

5301 2018-01-08 18:03:25 ...throwing out the baby with the bathwater.  Everyone (almost?) wants BTC to work out.  But saying everything is fine isn't helping.
5302 2018-01-08 18:03:24 Crypto escort girls, wtf is that
5303 2018-01-08 18:03:17 I don’t understand the thinking behind not including Korean exchanges. Seems to me you’d want a full scope of the landscape. Crypto will be much better when we’re not running decentralized lifestyles on centralized networks. 
5304 2018-01-08 18:03:16 I'm buying a ton of $KIN on #etherdelta for the F*ck of it. Why not? It's probably a #shitcoin but I like the project and it's 1/10th of a cent still. I'll let the noobs do the dirty work once it hits bigger exchanges.

5316 2018-01-08 18:02:19 The only thing that scares me is the volume.  It's trading almost 3x higher than any other alt on binance.  Any negativity (i.e. FUD) causes panic sell-offs with alot of new crypto owners -- which I assume is a large % of owners.

5325 2018-01-08 18:01:46 Use of the word “FUD” has become associated with defensiveness and partisanship.  Simple facts that make your favorite thing look bad are not FUD.  Critical thinking is not FUD.  Crypto investing doesn’t demand religious adherence. by #ValaAfshar
5326 2018-01-08 18:01:43 They are NO way inferior to their PAID competitors like MAC OS, WINDOWS, MS OFFICE etc. 
So why these opensource & free projects DIDN'T make it big?
In order to make anything successful, there needs to be a great TEAM and in crypto its MAYBE called as "Centralization"
5327 2018-01-08 18:01:42 Can we talk about how 'noobs' (which IMHO is a very degrading term) aren't the ONLY ones that make mistakes in the #crypto market. And for God's sake don't EVER forget that YOU were considered a 'noob' at one point in time #xrp #trx #xlm #ada #xvg #appc #btc #eth #ltc

5333 2018-01-08 18:01:25 We have to also understand that the a meaningful percentage of recent entrants into crypto investing space are very new to the idea of investing - and are taking risks they might not be prepared to lose money on.
5334 2018-01-08 18:01:11 Let’s not kid our selves, there is clearly a crypto-currency bubble happening. Lots of money has and probably still can be made, yet people forget that the true value of an investment only materialize once liquidated (or spent). Someone will end with the queen of spades.

5362 2018-01-08 17:59:00 The FUD is always shady. It inky comes when a coin starts doing good. I got in on Tron at about 3 cents, and I literally saw zero fud the whole time. Only when it went on its run did I see. The crypto community has shown me how pathetic it.. sling FUD if you missed gains
5363 2018-01-08 17:58:52 Evening @crypto_butlers! Can't seem to find them? I'm guessing they're yet to be listed? Also, any thoughts on $QASH?

5371 2018-01-08 17:57:29 telegram's rumor for ico shows the importance of network, any crypto wanting to stay relevant needs to leverage this aspect.
5372 2018-01-08 17:57:19 Otro problema con las Crypto es que no podés recrear la misma, pero nada te impide crear otra similar. Ahora hay mil tipos (pierde valor de escasez) y hay gente comprando Dogecoin o Cryptokittens porque $500 es más barato que $15.000 (basados en qué? Ni idea)
5373 2018-01-08 17:57:06 Daytraderlar altlarıni satar. Büyük ve saçma altları. $xrp $strat $ada falan. Ben küçük ve sağlam altlardayim $prl ve $bnty gibi. Bunların $btc pair i de kapalı. Düşse de diplerden toplarlar. Bugün totalde portfoliom düşse de geri dunki fiyata döndü. Sıfır kayıp

5390 2018-01-08 17:55:29 Is it legit?  I've talked to one person on there with high reviews and they didn't want to receive money from a business account (I was going to buy some bch) because he claimed that the bank was going to start asking questions.  Is this sorta grey market?
5391 2018-01-08 17:55:29 How do you view this #crypto dip :
5392 2018-01-08 17:55:13 great news 
5393 2018-01-08 17:55:12 not to the point its going to be. watch when gold starts sinking bc of crypto.
5394 2018-01-08 17:55:12 Actually, bc alot of the exchanges are not accepting registrations, people are indeed FLIPPING their accounts.
5395 2018-01-08 17:55:07 How do you know a crypto currency will go up or down in value? What information do you have or is it just a wild guess

5398 2018-01-08 17:54:54 @CrypterraMining for a company that says right on their site “ We do not hide, and our business is transparent” I find it odd that you would have a private domain.

5405 2018-01-08 17:54:19 It took a hit over Night, just a small hipcup. Os crypto we can't complain it could up 1 million tomorrow
5406 2018-01-08 17:54:18 cuanto crees que falte para que las crypto sean económicamente viables? (no como negocio sino como moneda)

5409 2018-01-08 17:54:15 It is nice to see #XRP come up a bit to $2.75 on @cex_io after a day of falling hard. Hoping that the week won't end as weird as it started. However, as I plan to buy a few more coins in the next days, wouldn't be so bad idea that it fell a little more before jumping up back.
5410 2018-01-08 17:54:09 Just think of the crypto market as having a HUGE sale today! BUY all you want! It’ll go back up and you’ll make big gains! I like days like this! 
5411 2018-01-08 17:54:07 Entire crypto slaughter today was caused by CoinMarketCap changing a parameter without telling anyone.  #ripple
5412 2018-01-08 17:54:00 It will work itself out eventually. Crypto is just so hot right now and with ETH on the move its prob getting a lot of attention atm
5413 2018-01-08 17:53:58 although if that's really the channel it will trade in to 1.25, it might take a whole week, that's a long time for crypto!
5414 2018-01-08 17:53:55 @BittrexExchange Hey @BittrexExchange any idea on when you might open up again for people who want to join?  I read that you are super overwhelmed from everyone who wants to join but I am really wanting to delve into crypto currency as we become a crypto nation.
5415 2018-01-08 17:53:48 @Crowd_indicator  Been utilising the Cindicator Bot data feeds and they are quite remarkable. It is impossible to scavenge and process all data in a world as diverse and ever changing as Crypto. But I get excellent curated signals from them, helped me get 2x twice. Keep growing.
5416 2018-01-08 17:53:42 The crypto world is funny.  200% gain followed by 50% correction= CRASH!  Do people not understand That the market can't just go straight up?  Expect some dips, folks.
5417 2018-01-08 17:53:36 El PETRO, no es crypto por que no es minado, es una emisión en los margenes de la ilegalidad por no ser aprobada por AN, es un activo que se menciona “respaldado” en 'commodities' que tendrá colateral en divisa ($) por lo tanto entrará a regulación por el Tesoro de EEUU
5418 2018-01-08 17:53:22 A lot of cryptocurrency on sale today! Who’s buying the dip?                  #trading #exchange #cryptocurrency #crypto #money #invest #stock #bitcoin #ripple #xrp #ETN #eth #ltc #litecoin #STELLAR #ethereum #twitter #polls #buy

5422 2018-01-08 17:53:15 But sir I have been staking bitcoin for 2 months and no stake rewards yet?
5423 2018-01-08 17:53:05 #crypto twitter, help. Big chunk of portfolio is $TRX. Do I pull out and scoop some of this $XRP and $BCPT while prices are still low? Or just #HODL the $TRX to the ?

5428 2018-01-08 17:52:50 It's nothing against Verge cult. However cult coins pump best, screw fundaments or not working tech. If such crypto is future of financial system there is no reason to switch from banks.
5429 2018-01-08 17:52:50 I mean, it was inevitable, but maan who would have expected this crazy pump during last two days lol
5430 2018-01-08 17:52:47 because u were FUDding... if you are a developer you need to understand d builds throws error which doesn't show much info on Travis for a viewer like us. Just because its a open source u are able to track whats going on with #verge. not all the coins outthere does that for you.
5431 2018-01-08 17:52:44 Lol I’m dying here 
5432 2018-01-08 17:52:33 I can see Company's making their own Crypto on a Block Chains and selling it thru a Block Chain back by assets. This could get crazy.
5433 2018-01-08 17:52:30 absolutely... we believe in privacy...
5434 2018-01-08 17:52:23 Commenting or giving views on cryptocurrencies is getting similar to giving views on political parties.

You will face severe heat from the crypto lovers, if they find your view not matching with theirs. No comments on bitcoin or any crypto thing henceforth..............

5445 2018-01-08 17:51:35 That’s cool and all but this is the crypto market you’re talking about.. in a month all those coins will be forgotten and replaced by even more bullish coins.
5446 2018-01-08 17:51:27 95% of twitter is 2 weeks old in crypto and has no idea what they're talking about. They all want to get rich quick and be Bitcoin millionaires, but don't realize the peaks and valleys btc had to go through etc. this is normal for a coin.
5447 2018-01-08 17:51:26 But in the video you don’t see you with your phone deleting it ?
5448 2018-01-08 17:51:25 #XRP and every #crypto is down because Coin Market Cap decided to exclude Korean prices from their calculations, bringing the average price down. This may have caused temporary panic selling, just #HODL and if i were you it's great time buy. I'm stacking more $$$

5484 2018-01-08 17:49:25 I’d rather see your calls on twitter like the good old days.  Many of us are not full time day traders and don’t sit in front of the computer 24/7.  Twitter send tweets straight to the cell :)

5486 2018-01-08 17:49:19 @Ripple #XRP #xrpthestandard #btc People spreading FUD are doing more damage to crypto as whole than just Ripple.

5510 2018-01-08 17:47:25 $ZEC is great to buy right now because only 21 mil. coin supply, great team (but open source), and ZERO marketing and advertising (i.e., no good or bad hype yet).

5554 2018-01-08 17:44:20 you're a scam
5555 2018-01-08 17:44:09 MARKET UPDATE :-

Panic #Sellers Dumped #BITCOIN, Whereas #Whales Accumulated from Those Panic Sellers at a Cheap Price and Now BITCOIN Pump 
#BTC #Bitcoin #blockchain #Crypto #XRP #XVG #SC #HardFork #DOGE
5556 2018-01-08 17:44:04 Your portfolio is down to $500k. All I need is $700 and I'll be out of this crypto game.
5557 2018-01-08 17:44:04 Go back to making sandwhiches
5558 2018-01-08 17:44:01 Bon la crypto c’est la folie en fait, 2 semaines déjà gagner 1000€
5559 2018-01-08 17:43:52 Decentralization is a scam. No one wants that. The Bitcoin civil war proved this. Andreas, though useful for bootstraping, was wrong.
5560 2018-01-08 17:43:49 So you have about a 500x larger portfolio, than me, good to know :)
5561 2018-01-08 17:43:48 I trade pre race then in running. I do both. On most races (when doing racing) but I don’t do them all the time now. Many other plates spinning now #crypto
5562 2018-01-08 17:43:43 I like your optimism, but I don't think $100 by the end of year is likely.
5563 2018-01-08 17:43:38 @bcn_crypto  vivement qu'ils arrivent
5564 2018-01-08 17:43:36 Model x - then set new crypto goals 
5565 2018-01-08 17:43:26 If you ain’t up on this crypto currency  yougone regret it Years from now
5566 2018-01-08 17:43:25 For when you think $poe will take off
5567 2018-01-08 17:43:22 I want to invest in crypto currency but it seems so erratic. What are your thoughts on it?
5568 2018-01-08 17:43:20 So guys, nearly all ICO/crypto related issuers gapped down at the open. Fairly certain the primary catalyst was $UBIA suspension by the SEC.

Chill out a little. If you comment on hourly/daily pps performance the haters will say you are actively trading versus being LT investors.
5569 2018-01-08 17:43:16 The announcement will be released when it is ready to be released. #Verge team is not here to appease profit grabs, money flippers, or those superficially obsessed with shallow achievements such as lambos on the moon. This is real world changing technology being developed. $XVG
5570 2018-01-08 17:43:14 @Punksolid como vez el #dogecoin? la crypto del futuro? xD
5571 2018-01-08 17:43:13 Get Well Soon. Thanks for all of your research for the crypto community! 
5572 2018-01-08 17:43:11 officially 50/50 $trx and $xvg #cryptocurrency #Crypto
5573 2018-01-08 17:43:07 That's a graph. With candle sticks. Near the red arrow there's a moment where the price dropped briefly...  #dunno $ada #dropped
5574 2018-01-08 17:43:05 No please. Let them sell so we can load up on trx at discounted price.
5575 2018-01-08 17:42:54 If I read his tweet well, $Credo has just "invented" crypto stamp for email to avoid spam?
Email is used because it is free to send/receive, adding a stamp = very bad idea. Another shitty PnD coin IMHO.
Also, just read the intro of the whitepaper "email is broken", no it is not.
5576 2018-01-08 17:42:51 Independent currencies are still related. If USD goes down, it would probably mean another currencies or Store of Value (gold, silver, art, crypto) go up.
5577 2018-01-08 17:42:47 how to trade crypto: change settings and scale until you talk yourself into buying something and sell half on a double
5578 2018-01-08 17:42:47 i stand behind EVERYTHING i wrote, even that luxury mis-spellings :-).
5579 2018-01-08 17:42:46 You could pay me crypto
5580 2018-01-08 17:42:39 bought more Crypto
5581 2018-01-08 17:42:38 @CryptoCoinNewz Hey! You reckon this is a new support level before next rise (ie I should buy more)... or is it going to pull back a bit further first...?
5582 2018-01-08 17:42:30 XRP and a healthier crypto market? What?
5583 2018-01-08 17:42:29 Grande
5584 2018-01-08 17:42:28 Reminds me of raiblocks
5585 2018-01-08 17:42:28 Bitcoin, like US Treasuries, are the ‘Flight to Quality’ asset.  When the sh1t is hitting the fan in crypto, there is only one asset to own if you like to stay invested to participate in the bounce because only Gods and Liars pick the tops and bottoms....Bitcoin!
5586 2018-01-08 17:42:27 Trx $1 by end of month!
5587 2018-01-08 17:42:26 sure, they are welcome :)  #BTC
5588 2018-01-08 17:42:25 you need to correct that prediction. NEBL already hit 51 today and hovering over 40 right now :D
5589 2018-01-08 17:42:25 Looks like some big time MarketCap came out of Crypto last night... Hopefully this BTC gets into my @binance acct before the dip becomes a rip.

5597 2018-01-08 17:41:46 $RPX Ooh la la, what a day     Hope you joined the journey. Been tweeting about this gem for a long time :) $RPX $NEO #Crypto
5598 2018-01-08 17:41:46 What I meant is that it will be way too much overhead for people to count the gain (or loss) every time they spend crypto on a day to day purchase. Staying in compliance of capital gains taxes will be grueling. We need tax reform for crypto or it will be hard for it to take off.
5599 2018-01-08 17:41:40 Long term I see it as an incredibly exciting movement. Fingers crossed that is mirrored in the continued price hike!
5600 2018-01-08 17:41:40 Yep, we got in. Was a good presentation, he’s a great presenter. Not much on Volta in this event, but huge advancements in AI and Deep learning processing. nVidia focusing on that 10 Trillion Market of transportation while their gaming/crypto GPU tech sitting at 100 billion.
5601 2018-01-08 17:41:38 What does everyone use to invest or buy Crypto?
5602 2018-01-08 17:41:33 why no one watching cnbc first its just nbc liberal blah second no avg Joe even knows what crypto currency is much less track it
5603 2018-01-08 17:41:23 Done sir!

5611 2018-01-08 17:40:42 most probably YES!!!.
5612 2018-01-08 17:40:39 I've ignored crypto currencies until Telegram announced theirs. I predict it'll be more useful than Bitcoin.

5619 2018-01-08 17:39:56 Ragstocrypto...prove it with your own evidence and research....not the FUD going around
5620 2018-01-08 17:39:56 Keep in mind ETH is not built to be a Bitcoin replacement but instead is the platform that the future of crypto and payments will be built on. Makes it a very long term investment and this could be the beginning of it having its own investment track instead of riding BTC
5621 2018-01-08 17:39:53 Similar to the original pre-bitcoin "crypto", would be cool to see this idea re-vamped for the 21st cent
5622 2018-01-08 17:39:53 This is a good sneaky buy that a lot of people are going to miss. This project is needed in crypto. We'll all benefit from it once it's up and running. 

Also... little reminder to anyone holding $MTL... move that shit to a wallet before it's delisted from trex.

5640 2018-01-08 17:39:02 It's *bear
5641 2018-01-08 17:39:02 Even if Ripple does become a global payment system for banks short term, surely it's just a last gasp for centralised financial institutions before the real power of decentralisation manifests and all the money flows into cryptoassets. $crypto #bitcoin #xrp

5644 2018-01-08 17:38:51 That makes sense. I guess I just don't see it having long-term value when/if crypto becomes a mainstream form of payment.
5645 2018-01-08 17:38:45 40-60 cents
5646 2018-01-08 17:38:45 Just found out Bitwise Investments doesn't accept bitcoin or any other crypto as a source of funds. Kinda annoying since I was hoping to use them to diversify existing BTC holdings. @kyletorpey: you posted about them recently and I'm curious if you ever moved forward with them?
5647 2018-01-08 17:38:43 But...But...then people on Twitter can't claim you're a Crypto shill.

5653 2018-01-08 17:38:18 1/ One fascinating thing about crypto is how attached you can become to your coins. Irrationally, so, perhaps. I know this is true because it's how I feel, and I'm definitely not the only one. I don't really enumerate their value in fiat, either.
5654 2018-01-08 17:38:17 For them, a blockchain is a database with virtue. virtuous databases are great for investors, but offer users no efficiency.

5656 2018-01-08 17:38:12 There are multiple levels of centralization. Mining(if exists), Development, Marketing, Funding, Strategy to name a few. Each level require consensus amongst some set of parties to determine path forward. I can point to any reputable crypto and identify some centralization.
5657 2018-01-08 17:38:11 Have you heard of The Legends Room? Look it up they accept crypto currency and even have a membership club that you can only be in if you have a certain amount of crypto. It’s in Vegas lol
5658 2018-01-08 17:38:11 People in crypto treat bags like an extension themselves, and they treat an attack on those bags like a physical attack.

stop it.

5661 2018-01-08 17:38:06 I think @VitalikButerin is the most sincere guy in crypto. He is very humble and openly admits the flaws in Ethereum. In my opinion, truly wants to make a change and use blockchain for the better.

5678 2018-01-08 17:36:58 Sweetbridge will not be restricted to crypto assets. Very quickly, the platform will ramp up to collateralize physical assets and supply chain assets, property, etc. This will de-risk the system.

Hi Haejin. Just want to say thank you for all the help you offer. I would have been lost without your guidance. I have been doing all your tutorials and am getting  there slowly. The only thing I am struggling on the charts and graphs is the time frames.
5683 2018-01-08 17:36:42 Online wallet for exrn? and what’s the contract adress?

5688 2018-01-08 17:36:18 It's probably more to do with the crypto tech  than the dollar value of the currency adding value.

just wondering if i still stand a chance?

5694 2018-01-08 17:35:51 1% of the American population has any real idea what #crypto is
50% of them have any money to put into it
50% of them have the mindset to HODL and not get fucked on dips
25% of them bother to do the damn research

Only about 200k people in this country that can do well on #crypto
5695 2018-01-08 17:35:51 Easy prediction for 2018:

Bitcoin will not be the crypto currency with the highest "capitalization" by year's end.

5711 2018-01-08 17:34:43 ひさびさにICOに強気の投資をしてみた。

かなり早い段階なので、本当に直感のみ。

拘束期間・取引所・ICO状況等々で変わってくると思いますが、3,4月を楽しみに待ちたいと思います。
5712 2018-01-08 17:34:42 my question its because all crypto cards are suspended last 5 jan... centra don't will be suspended?

Didn't touch anything haha.
5716 2018-01-08 17:34:36 this demonstrates the kind of people who are invested in crypto-- weak hands. I saw the drop as a buying opportunity.

5720 2018-01-08 17:34:12 Australian Banks are also closing accounts that invested in crypto exchanges. I think all other govts will have something to say about these. Regulatory risks are just getting bigger with the size now... #bitcoin

5733 2018-01-08 17:33:18 LoL on a serious note,  Dont get into crypto trading if your scared to lose bread.  These days i like to go huge so when things are in the "Green" im coming up with great gains and margins.  But when its in the red its the same way but in reverse.
5734 2018-01-08 17:33:10 I have some Korean won when I was in South Korea 2015-16. It's cool to show people
5735 2018-01-08 17:33:09 yea, sell those tokens to me please.
5736 2018-01-08 17:33:08 Everything changes. They might come up saying “For a healthier and more efficient Crypto market, we are pleased to announce #XRP listing on Coinbase starting Saturday 1100 GMT. Happy trading”
5737 2018-01-08 17:33:08 I think It's time for #Cryptocurrency market to be big enough not to be affected by each and every move of media. #Crypto #btc #eth #xrp #ltc #bch #xlm #xcg #trx #CryptocurrencyNews
5738 2018-01-08 17:33:06 News coming out of china regarding the ban of btc mining hurting the price of BTC? Or just a fake news?
5739 2018-01-08 17:33:00 I see.
The problem I’m seeing is CNBC trying to explain cryptos on live TV sending noobie crypto dweebs onto twitter and all these exchanges trying to buy things lik $XRP and people like Mcafee are abusing their status by pumping shitcoins onto unsuspecting newcomers!!
5740 2018-01-08 17:32:58 Happened so many times, across so many cryptos
5741 2018-01-08 17:32:47 うーん、情報が早すぎる・・・ (全然追いつけないです～ ^^;)

5748 2018-01-08 17:32:23 Chinese govt says it is exiting cryptos as it figured out that it’s the new method of capital flight abroad. Chinese are —or were— not only the biggest miners, but also one of the biggest speculators in the crypto coins. #cryptocurrency #bitcoin

5752 2018-01-08 17:32:07 Ok everybody, get back to normal, this dip was just a drill. If you hodld like you always say you do, you did right. If you panicked - think about it, and the expectations you have, and maybe rethink your portfolio. Volatility has two sides. #Crypto
5753 2018-01-08 17:32:01 Ross, can you tell us how your Crypto index is doing today, and remind the serious investors investing in crypto that they should call you for strategy advise?

5758 2018-01-08 17:31:41 #xrp and crypto-holders please be aware of how heartless and difficult this field is. There is no place for emotions, play hard, study hard, research hard and you’ll be on the winning side. #xrpthestandard

5814 2018-01-08 17:27:53 I understand where you are coming from, but I look for coins that hit all the check marks from a fundamental (crypto-wise) perspective in addition to current and past progress on roadmaps. 3000% gains on coins without a working product mean little to me.

5830 2018-01-08 17:26:18 Corey is such a douche that even when he isn't around he doesn't let his friends have adequate time to talk about their latest crypto schemes

5832 2018-01-08 17:26:13 I tend to disagree here. If invested sensibly by doing your research properly, crypto is a great thing. But you must only invest some part of your savings and not blindly go for it.

5857 2018-01-08 17:24:27 Yok burda satış verip baskiliyo. Bu eleman ya ucuza btc alma derdinde ya da margin trading de kaldiracli btc açığa satışı yapmış. Bu spoofa destek bı de sosyal medyada FUD yayar. ( Tanıyorum yapanları ). Al sana kemiksiz x10 .

5859 2018-01-08 17:24:14 this can mean good and bad. This can be scary too.

5862 2018-01-08 17:24:02 So I had a patient tell me that his occupation is 1. An Artbroker. So I of course am thinking OK...so you hustle Unicorns. Coool and then he goes; and I am a Crypto dealer. OK Mario Brother. #WhatHappenedSoFar

5867 2018-01-08 17:23:49 I didn't even get to finish watching that video 

This is why it pays to put that little bit of extra time into crypto research
5868 2018-01-08 17:23:40 Note to self: don't get into arguments about crypto on twitter
5869 2018-01-08 17:23:39 Everything drop, good time for buy tho. I'm Portuguese investor in London. Nice to follow u
5870 2018-01-08 17:23:31 I'm more excited to have Alvin Kamara as a 14th round keeper this year than I am for almost every single crypto project at these prices.

5871 2018-01-08 17:23:29 Students should use their Loans to Invest in Crypto
5872 2018-01-08 17:23:24 Yesterday everybody was expecting a Bitcoin bull run. The opposite usually happens.
5873 2018-01-08 17:23:23 Today. The new people that came to crypto with greed in their eyes we're tough a hard lesson. "Smart money dumped on dumb money".
5874 2018-01-08 17:23:21 I got an email from rude awakening investment. Says Amazon will start using a crypto coin by end of Feb. 2018. No mention without buying his repor. Could that be #xrp????!!!
5875 2018-01-08 17:23:20 1600 sats
5876 2018-01-08 17:23:12 Does it matter that $BUZZ has higher volume in Coin Exchange than in YoBit
5877 2018-01-08 17:23:11 100k TRX at 5 figures damn you bought wayyyyyy too high.
Lol the $$ price means nothing with BTC price fluctuations it's never constant that's why in the crypto world we use fractions of a Bitcoin called Satoshis because that's always a constant welcome to crypto my friend
5878 2018-01-08 17:23:09 Güzel grafik, olmuş mu?....Olmuş be! Aynen devam. Yengeden azarı yedin dikkat et ;)

5880 2018-01-08 17:23:05 Right my point is let’s see gov try and fine any other crypto network. The day they got fined was the day they turned into one of them.
5881 2018-01-08 17:23:05 Là est la question.
5882 2018-01-08 17:22:57 hayırlı olsun hocam yüzde yüz yada beşyüz.. bin kazanmaya hazırız hocam bist çok belalı tahta sahipleri falan bıkkınlık
5883 2018-01-08 17:22:56 Don’t forget about the tax benefits and making your donation go further. By giving crypto to an org instead of cashing out -then- donating, you bypass being taxed (on donation) and the non-profit gets MORE of your donation! #win
5884 2018-01-08 17:22:43 Hello Sir, could you help the Crypto community and inform your followers that HitBtc one of the major exchanges is abusive and should not be trusted. All our ETH or ERC20 Token are pending for days and weeks @VitalikButerin
5885 2018-01-08 17:22:36 That’s what a slacker with no work ethic would say 
5886 2018-01-08 17:22:34 Invest in your brain, invest in equity don't expect you will put small amount in crypto and it will give you multiple returns. Virtual things are virtual only. Investment in crypto is best example of herd mentality.
5887 2018-01-08 17:22:32 Bonne stratégie
5888 2018-01-08 17:22:27 Ouais j'ai vu l'autre jour pour le XLM, au final j'ai quand même pu vendre ce matin à 4383
Merci en tout cas
5889 2018-01-08 17:22:24 I got an email from rude awakening investment. Says Amazon will start using a crypto coin by end of Feb. 2018. No mention without buying his repor. Could that be #xrp????!!!

5891 2018-01-08 17:22:17 DM for details 
5892 2018-01-08 17:22:16 So now probably isn’t a good time to tell u I invested 13 dollars into crypto currency. I’ll be adding Entrepreneur/Bitcoin Miner to my twitter bio within the hour
5893 2018-01-08 17:22:10 @elonmusk you can literally launch ICO (initial coin offering) with blockchain technology with Mars project and all people who are in crypto world would send billions to finance that project, on top of that all investors (coin) holders would benefit from it. That would be huge :)
5894 2018-01-08 17:22:00 Nonsense TBH. You can see what addresses control most of the Bitcoin/BitcoinBCH - tough to see who owns those addresses though. Pretty sure Roger has a lot of Bitcoincash but he and a few others do not control the wealth. Litecoin is much more controled in this aspect.
5895 2018-01-08 17:21:59 念のためもう一発に備えて200万指しとくか
5896 2018-01-08 17:21:57 Yeah I don't even touch BTC anymore, just too expensive to do anything with.  If I trade I go through BCC, much better value proposition.
5897 2018-01-08 17:21:56 Het is niet zo moeilijk .. adviseer je wel een hardware wallet aan te schaffen .. blijf weg van handelsplatformen als plus500 etc (risico) .. aanschaffen in een dip .. naar je wallet, houden en rustig wachten .. verder spreiding, nooit meer dan 10% van je portefeuille in crypto's
5898 2018-01-08 17:21:54 They also have given away and spent more #Bitcoin Than you can even fathom. This is what makes them special, being rich and greedy would make you the Ahole that @bitcoincoreorg Supporters paint @rogerkver but he is a giver not a taker...like @Blockstream
5899 2018-01-08 17:21:41 If anybody doesn't want their Cardano, you can just give it to me  Vaporware wouldn't have a CEO presenting at Oxford today and a working wallet with a good UX. Also it is not just a token but a new generation of crypto. Patience friends.
5900 2018-01-08 17:21:36 Everyone needs to start using livecoinwatch n not use @CoinMarketCap. LiveCoinWatch automatically updates prices live!Market manipulators like @CoinMarketCap and #Bitcoincash need to feel the sting of the people! #crypto #bitcoin #shady

5933 2018-01-08 17:19:20 Since they already held a majority of the bitcoin supply they too received the same amount in BCH. A majority of #bitcoincash supporters where founding members of #Bitcoin thus the reason they have much more #BTC and #bch than others.
5934 2018-01-08 17:19:02 Most people have negative balances in their crypto wallet. We call that debt in the real world more dangerous because of wild fluctuations in valuation.
5935 2018-01-08 17:18:57 All of the exchanges are struggling to keep up with the exponential increase in demand for crypto right now. As we stand on the brink of mainstream adoption, the infrastructure is creaking under the strain. Some delays are going to be inevitable.
5936 2018-01-08 17:18:55 wow, #crypto got hid hard last night, even the ripply stuff. coinmarketcap is below $750B again. not to worry, it'll bounce back.

5941 2018-01-08 17:18:32 Many coins in the red today. If you’ve been in crypto long enough, you’re not panicking but rather riding the wave and figuring out a good time to re-enter. Are you a holder or do you sell at the top and re-buy when the market goes down?

5945 2018-01-08 17:18:29 I hope that my experiences could be anyhow inspirative for you. How I keep having profit with an investment of a little more than $100. My goal is to not add a cent more from my pocket but turn my initial investment in a big profit using the Crypto Tsunami in the right direction.
5946 2018-01-08 17:18:22 I get most of the people
On this thread are 2 weeks old into crypto. But go back and look at btc, ltc, xrp, all of these peaks and valleys happen for every successful coin. Many times over. You should see how many times xrp hit 25 cents for me then dipped back down
5947 2018-01-08 17:18:21 C'est du Fake. Ya aucune loi encore sur les bénéfices émanent des crypto en Belgique

5949 2018-01-08 17:18:19 None of this really... Just think Justin and Tron are still figuring out the crypto game and made a mistake. With proper guidance, Tron can be huge.

5954 2018-01-08 17:18:00 @CEO worth it starting with crypto trading? 
5955 2018-01-08 17:17:55 I don’t tweet about it much but my handle says it all. #XLM is one of the most promising projects in #crypto. The fact that there are so many countries that do not have bank type transfers.. but many countries there’s access to a cell phone. @StellarOrg will empower so many. #btc

5989 2018-01-08 17:15:37 Crypto twitter and discord / telegram discussions will be on crypto nostalgia youtube videos
5990 2018-01-08 17:15:31 Yes i personally believe there will be an adjustment on the crypto-market with most of this useless token taken off the market, bubble companies will disappear and a better regulated market on upcoming ICOs with more securities for the investors!
5991 2018-01-08 17:15:31 Someone is investing in crypto it seems.
5992 2018-01-08 17:15:29 Hope you're right!!!

Hello chapo et merci pour tes tweets !! J'ai beaucoup appris grâce à eux !!
Est-ce que tu sais comment ça se passe (en france) niveau impôts pour les gains faits avec les crypto monnaies ?
5997 2018-01-08 17:15:10 J'ai 16 ans et je me suis fait 1500€ grâce au ripple  pendant les 2 semaines de vacances :) 
Au passage la chute la chute des crypto est du à @CoinMarketCap . Rien de grave, c'est le moment d'investir avant que les valeurs remontent plus vite qu'elles ne sont descendu.
5998 2018-01-08 17:14:57 Buna ziua dragii mei! Va doresc un an nou cat mai fericit si multe multe victorii in Crypto! Impreuna vom REUSI! #Firea #Crypto #PSD
5999 2018-01-08 17:14:18 Wasn’t EOS meant to explode days ago? Maybe you’d be better off saying EOS is about to “gently increase over the next few weeks” ? Might be more accurate than saying it’s about to “EXPLODE”

6002 2018-01-08 17:14:14 @realDonaldTrump If you took the entire military budget and put that $$ into the crypto currency Ripple (XRP) in November, you would have completely paid off our national debt.  Embrace the Crypto Revolution and make a serious difference.
6003 2018-01-08 17:14:01 No one thought it possible At first it was close, then with the help of many true #crypto enthusiasts & great @DeepOnionx #Anonymous #Tor #Altcoin members DeepOnion raced ahead & many also wanted to see DogecoinDark crushed for the first time ever on a twitter poll #DeepOnionWins
6004 2018-01-08 17:13:56 Idk that the vol is there yet, still great time to accumulate as it could take till end of week to finally break. $XVG will def pay off. Can we get another 1700 sat break out?

6014 2018-01-08 17:13:19 The whole point of crypto is no regulation and doing just the opposite doesn't make it any different then regular banks. Anyhow the amount you transact is always under the lens of taxmen. The only amendment I suggest is strict regulations of crypto exchanges.
6015 2018-01-08 17:13:17 when every other crypto is trying to be listed on many exchanges we believe you are doing something more different, something exceptional.. Good Luck!!
6016 2018-01-08 17:13:16 My life revolves around Crypto. I’m getting close to the retirement point. But it probably won’t ever happen, I enjoy this to much.. Sit back and make grands everyday. Can’t ask GOD for a better life..
6017 2018-01-08 17:13:14 One thing I am trying to wrap my head around equities vs. crypto currency is that there is benefit of owning 100% of available equity for a company, the company is still worth its inflows-outflows, but if someone acquired all $BTC I think it would no longer have value.

6070 2018-01-08 17:10:14 Der Grund ist einfach, CMC hat die kroansischen Märkte rausgenommen und damit den Durchschnitsspreis deutlich gesenkt.

6117 2018-01-08 17:07:30 I feel bad for anyone not getting involved in the Crypto Revolution. In 2-3 years these ICOs and new coins will definitely not be nearly as profitable. It’s important to get in early, learn, and invest now before it’s too late.

Is there anyway for us to load our own crypto coin on to the card and start using it. Because going through an exchange and so many step involve is just pain in the ass. I just don't understand what different is it make compare to a normal debit card.

6241 2018-01-08 17:00:53 It's possible that in the near term, state crypto's could prove more attractive if they offer better liquidity. It'll be a trade off of sorts, but given the security issues with #BTC and issues with cashing out, I wouldn't bet against state crypto's taking a bite out of #BTC.

6299 2018-01-08 16:57:48 As I understand it, Segwit enables you to pack more transactions in one block, so theoretically there would be a reduction in fees as miners are able to take less fees for more transactions.

6301 2018-01-08 16:57:35 All the people I respect in #crypto are of a negative sentiment about the market right now...
6302 2018-01-08 16:57:35 Regarding #Ripple I have purchased on @cex_io 15.21 units for $2.22. As well I will be revieving this investment beside the rest.
6303 2018-01-08 16:57:28 Meh rather typical of the community to be fair. Use to it. Let me ask you Nik, why do most grass roots crypto heads dislike it so much?
6304 2018-01-08 16:57:27 FWIW, a lot of people in the crypto community see/have-seen this coming. The talk about it a lot - the loss of control of crypto to states, especially via banning #BTC and other crypto currencies outright, which is already happening. [2/n]
6305 2018-01-08 16:57:26 @RealAlexJones New tax law criminalizes crypto trading. It's impossible to track all required. Crypto trading is funding New tech and start up companies directly without investors or creators being fleeced by banks, brokers or hedge fund hustlers.
6306 2018-01-08 16:57:24 That is the fuckery in crypto space. Nobudy beats an eye before SHTF. And than users are reading this messages. I just hope that they are solvent for the coins that are parked there - outpoor will be massive...

6320 2018-01-08 16:56:25 well mostly because crypto became a significant funding method for gambling/sports betting sites -- so naturally people who used that as method then became crypto people or the other way as well have crypto then found that you could use it to bet on sports

But control is paramount to every nation state's desire to set up their own crypto, right? Backing or not. [1/n]

1. Know your limits.
2. If you're going into a trade in hurry You are gonna loose.
3. No panic selling. HODL
4. Always have stop loss.
5. Never short $BTC.
5. Never Ever buy $XRP and $MCO cuntcoins.

6366 2018-01-08 16:54:04 Dicks, if you don't know or understand what a correction is or the correlation between BTC and Altcoins, you should not be writing, informing, advising or blogging of any sort about crypto.

6367 2018-01-08 16:53:45 Hi there,I invested a decent amount of money into a coin and now i'm pretty stuck with it.

6385 2018-01-08 16:52:51 @realDonaldTrump New tax law turns crypto traders into criminals to be harassed and persecuted by the IRS. Crypto trading allows main street to finance start ups directly without both being fleeced by banks, brokers and hedge fund hucksters. Please look into this.

6394 2018-01-08 16:52:25 in my experience "bias" is what a crypto advocate says when they haven't evidence

6406 2018-01-08 16:52:05 Seems to me that most people entering crypto are too lazy to do this steps. But once XRP will be more easy to acquire for them.. I truly believe that it will push the price to a new ATH
6407 2018-01-08 16:51:49 Have you come to a conclusion?
6408 2018-01-08 16:51:49 So what amazes me is this guy built his fortune infecting computers so they would need his services... Yet even if you didn't know he was tied to that and are new to crypto its obvious how unreliable and bad for the market he really is.
6409 2018-01-08 16:51:41 Crypto: think of it as a coin backed by the full protection of a bunch of hackers who want to steal from you either way...working in a bucket shop steam room in some foreign land....now you are getting the picture. oh it's up! one bought from his friend...what do you know!

6419 2018-01-08 16:51:14 No coins were pre-mined - Every single person that had Bitcoin in a wallet that they controlled on Aug 1st 2017 before the Hard Fork , got automatically given the same amount of #Bitcoincash. This is due to the blockchain being a snapshot and the same addresses used.
6420 2018-01-08 16:51:13 I still have not got an REVD. This is a real team of scammers. They sold the tokens of BTCRED, deceived the people that in 2018 the crypto currency would be made, they collected the money of investors, and then they closed the token and robbed the people. We must punish them.

6423 2018-01-08 16:51:00 Based on the research I have been doing, $1 seems to be on the conservative side of things. Now, there are some insane figures being thrown around out there, but the outlook is extremely positive regardless.
6424 2018-01-08 16:50:54 I know we are mostly anti-political but some of you who have made silly amounts of money in crypto need to think about using those gains to run for office. We need more free market capitalists who understand technology out there.
6425 2018-01-08 16:50:51 @officialmcafee I'm working on a way to value crypto startups using standard accepted metrics...by creating those metrics.  Can I talk to you some time about this?  No one seems to be taking this approach.

If you are new to JouleCoin / Crypto World and just wish to mine few coins but don’t own a miner?@miningrigrental is a great place to rent few TH/s. Rental prices are “market” reasonable and you can rent from few hours to days.
6453 2018-01-08 16:48:36 We have been hearing during whole weekend that the reason why #Ripple price has been falling so much is to adjust it for the launch on #Coinbase in the near future. Do you think it may be just an strategy to reach a bigger population?

6477 2018-01-08 16:46:21 Bit of a dip in #Electroneum today, down to 14c. Keeping mine on lock down and scooping up more tomorrow with this lull. Have a good feeling about this coin in 2018! What are your predictions? #Crypto #AltCoins #BlockChain #ETN #Cryptocurrency

6479 2018-01-08 16:46:18 Drawing the charts of promising ALT's retracing from their low's, this scenario could be one of the explanations of their potential recovery (fib-retrace). Or BTC and ALT's go UpUp&Away together with increase marktcap. Ride the Orca ;-)

6506 2018-01-08 16:44:30 The trick with Crypto is to start getting drunk in the morning so you're nicely hammered ready to celebrate the recovery in the evening. #btc
6507 2018-01-08 16:44:28 #TRX is the only crypto that has jumped to the top 10 promoting worldwide free content entertainment. I feel as if this hate and fud stems from #trx getting to this first? Apps, movies, games, music, bought with a currency you can earn by using the apps and games. It's Genius.
6508 2018-01-08 16:44:22 I have a hard time believing you would've come to that conclusion had you done your own research. If you were to come back on air and relay why BTC still holds its place as the most secure network and crypto reserve currency, you would be a hero in this space

6512 2018-01-08 16:44:17 It's dropping b/c BTC dropped. When BTC bounces or when BTC dips altcoins bleed. They only go up when BTC stabilizes and goes sideways.

6513 2018-01-08 16:44:16 Wouldn't Putin prefer Clinton in the WH?  She brokered the uranium one deal and established the Russian Reset policy even giving Russia an actual Reset Button lol.  You make no sense at all and are historically in the wrong without any evidence to support that claim.

6516 2018-01-08 16:44:14 incorrect, thats money you can only use for transferring coins. So you can’t cash it out
6517 2018-01-08 16:44:13 I only trade against USD, it’s the only real indicator of how much crypto you own, take profits in USD because it’s actually stable and can buy you a lambo today and tomorrow with it

6571 2018-01-08 16:41:13 Yep - but then you see valuations jump cause they added crypto to their value prop.
6572 2018-01-08 16:41:09 Rise of Crytocurrencies are linked to the model that we will update soon. Crypto is currency a speculative trading tool and is too volatile to become a mainstream currency. As soon as it is benchmarked to gold/basket of currencies, it will be here to stay.
6573 2018-01-08 16:41:02 Let this be a lesson for all us, a large part of crypto owners respond to bad news instantly! @Ripple need to have strong communication structures, at all times.
6574 2018-01-08 16:41:02 Woke up to big $BTC crash and blood across the entire #alt market. Another day in crypto. I sold my $PKB bag, which was conveniently pumped at the same time, so at least I bought a little bit of the BTC dip. Could sell my $DGB too, but I think it's got more upward potential.
6575 2018-01-08 16:41:01 Clairement d’accord avec toi, je pensais davantage court terme sur une période de 2-3 jours, en visant un 20% max en stop sell, et partir sur d’autres cryptos.

6587 2018-01-08 16:40:43 Anyone want to come with me and drive around Australia in Jan 2021 after I cash out my crypto.. I am looking to cash out $500k and leave $500k in there to live off.... so that means I will be living out of a VR for 20 years.. doing what I want to do... who wants to come..?
6588 2018-01-08 16:40:37 If it breaks 1200 sats we should hit 1500 easy. Trx still the highest volume in binance.
6589 2018-01-08 16:40:36 @crypto_bobby I have a ledger Nano s to store my coins that its compatible with but I was wondering how do you recommend storing the coins that the Nano is not compatible with like XVG and PIVX? Seen bad experiences on apps like coinami. People loose coins. Is a paperwallet good?
6590 2018-01-08 16:40:33 It looks like there's a lot of "children" trying to get rich quick in crypto. Don't get mad at the world if you didn't buy the right coin. Do your designated research before buying.
6591 2018-01-08 16:40:33 it looks like @binance_2017  is allowing registrations off and on - keep trying and refreshing as you are able. Some are reporting that they have been able to get through. Get your $XVG!

Good luck everyone

6637 2018-01-08 16:37:04 The problem w crypto currencies is that people have joined in not based on the Blockchain concept and only for the Bullish/upward trend sell all their positions when they see a dip; shotout to those of us buying because we believe in decentralization. #changingfinance

6654 2018-01-08 16:35:35 My son talked me into this. I purchased 500.00 of bitcoin then put just over 200 in ripple and just over 200 in dogecoin a month ago. It has just a little more than doubled. I’m impressed.

6727 2018-01-08 16:31:21 You’d be surprised just how many ppl know absolutely nothing about investing or trading and get into crypto with thousands and no plan. This was me not even a month ago, yet due to the community you can learn! Just stay hungry for knowledge and #Patient
6728 2018-01-08 16:31:15 Bitcoin is a digital currency (also called crypto-currency) that is not backed by any country's central bank or government.

6767 2018-01-08 16:28:10 #crypto is so very interesting! #Coinmarketcap automatically removes outliers like BTCKRW to USD conversion but people believe CMC providing different average prices actually has this much impact? Individual exchange rates did not change... something is going on.
6768 2018-01-08 16:28:09 Remember to preface every #crypto debate with the fact that you have been involved in the space since 2013 and have seen it all.

6891 2018-01-08 16:19:14 We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run. Let this be your mantra when #investing in #Crypto. Think constructively about what #cryptocurrency will mean 5-10-20 years from now, not tomorrow.

6896 2018-01-08 16:18:40 A friend suspects that #crypto is attempt to create systemic risk and financial havoc so that capitalism can be blamed again. Many crypto investors who will lose everything and even property will blame free markets and join the communist camp propaganda.

6935 2018-01-08 16:16:10 So those that followed hype to buy are following it to dump. Hyper inflated #shtcoins weeded out, strong #cryptos bounce back and continue to rise and rise. Long game strategy all the way. #Buy #HODL $btc $xrp $eth $hst $ltc

6969 2018-01-08 16:14:18 I'm what to call it of not a security. It isn't a currency without an exchange rate. It isn't necessarily a commodity bc it has basically no true intrinsic value. It definitely isn't big enough to upend USD. The US isn't regulating crypto near as much as it could also imo
6970 2018-01-08 16:14:16 #verge let me give everyone a tiny bit of advice.
1: Do not invest any money you cannot afford to lose.
2: Believe in your choice's before investing, not after.
3: You only lose money if you sell low.
4:Find and research a few crypto and Diversify.

6978 2018-01-08 16:13:49 This is sad. How can you really defend Electroneum? Yes that stuff is open source, that doesn’t mean that them taking it and starting their own project, should give it any value. If I fork Monero today, is it worth anything? Cause if so I’ll fork right now and take my millions.

7025 2018-01-08 16:10:24 #crypto "crash" today is thanks to CMC excluding a bunch of prices from their exchange and people panicking...

7029 2018-01-08 16:10:05 It is bullshit to have DOGE pumped. It is a utter joke for the  whole crypto community. It is not even developed touched by any developer the last two years. (Except the vital edit 2 hours before :) ) #doge #dogecoin #Scamcoin

Just hold your #xrp and do not sell in all these panic attacks. It will make the coin less stable and accepted, plus will keep away  others to join. Keep them, never offer the first 1-2 years, support the xrp and you will be rewarded for it!
7057 2018-01-08 16:08:34 If you were to invest 5 thousand pounds today in crypto, with the vision of keeping it in for 1 year, what would you invest in? And how much would you invest in per coin?
7058 2018-01-08 16:08:34 Great Read!
7059 2018-01-08 16:08:32 Yes the coin that cloned Monero definitely deserves to be even near the same market cap. No, it doesn’t, fuck eletroneum

7070 2018-01-08 16:08:01 Crypto Investors really need to wise up and read between the lines. When the tide ebbs, there’d be so much fraud it’d be unbelievable.
7071 2018-01-08 16:07:58 Here’s what we Know about today’s going red.
Market pullback, typical crypto. Like the Six Million Dollar Man. To quote Oscar Goldman “ We have the technology. We have the capability.” Crypto will be “Better than he was before. Better... stronger... faster.”

7077 2018-01-08 16:07:47 Honestly the best way to find good crypto is invest in something you believe in and something that serves a purpose. There are lot of shit coins out there that are basically for novelty. XRP, Verge have real world tech and backing. Even if you think you're too late, you're not.

7167 2018-01-08 16:03:57 Well a lot of money and computerised trading models does. Also btc is always going to be the real daddy here, so shit like this will influence everything. TBH come back to me in 1 week and we will chat about your thoughts on crypto market tanking!
7168 2018-01-08 16:03:53 Hi Man , I bought a new LTCs , what do you suggest keep them to change them for which coins?
7169 2018-01-08 16:03:52 How long does it usually take #Kucoin to deposit transfers? Been 24 hours since #Coinbase transferred my ethereum over but still no sign....#Crypto Thanks
7170 2018-01-08 16:03:52 bro i told chat im in on etc till it blows up
7171 2018-01-08 16:03:46 スキャム扱いされても握り続けて、応援し続けて、行き着いた先がこれじゃ怒りたくもなるだろうなぁと思うのです。
7172 2018-01-08 16:03:44 Given how stupid normies are, $XRP will definitely recover one day haha. But I wouldn't invest now, since the upside is way smaller than the downside. (Given that it doesn't overtake $BTC in marketcap)
7173 2018-01-08 16:03:37 This should be a big week for Tron.
7174 2018-01-08 16:03:37 In some of my friends groups I'm also the calm guy, when everything goes mental, so just felt the need to share some things.
7175 2018-01-08 16:03:35 no. I just saw it on there and I am sharing.
7176 2018-01-08 16:03:31 Where can you get CryptoCurrency Master Degree? The University of Nicosia, leading university in Cyprus and one of the largest English language universities in the Mediterranean region #credits #blockchain #crypto , offers the first Master of Science degree in Digital Currency
7177 2018-01-08 16:03:26 $crypto market update pt 4 bought some $PAC $TRIG $QTUM and $LINDA for recovery. Proceed with caution and set stop loss in case recovery fakes out and bleeds deeper. This could trigger a correctional phase but odds on our side, huge upside potential for biggest losers. #Crypto
7178 2018-01-08 16:03:25 Sorry but I don't believe that's the future of Bitcoin. Sure it's price may rise and fall drastically, but then again so does the value of share market, that doesn't mean people stop investing in shares. Crypto currency is the future, even #RaghuramRajan himself couldn't deny it.
7179 2018-01-08 16:03:21 Ok so we sour a 180 billion taken out of the market of crypto today in less then 3 hours... it made everything drop and i bet a lot of people panic sold what they had in crypto... i fell sorry for them... for me if i had money i would have bought..  but i am holding .. i

7182 2018-01-08 16:03:14 Crypto currency is application of blockchain nothing significant it has no intrinsic value as a thing blockchain will prevail crypto currency see the fall into hell soon

7186 2018-01-08 16:03:08 Saw a headline last week that Venezuela will release an oil backed crypto currency.  Modern twist on Euro dollar method?  Interesting times, now your headline, very interesting after hearing the 5 part USD hegemony series on @MacroVoices
7187 2018-01-08 16:02:57 It was actually something to do with chair of South Korean CB trash talking crypto. Usual stuff. When 1st regulation on crypto trading actually goes through the crash will be >50%.
7188 2018-01-08 16:02:50 @OVPN_official Any plans for other cryptocurrency support? Looking to renew my yearly plan but BTC is a little too pricey fee-wise. How about ETH/LTC/DASH/BCH/any other 3-year plus developed crypto like ZEC/ZMR?

7190 2018-01-08 16:02:44 I grok what Phil is saying: extreme value fluctuations of crypto (namely bitcoin) make actually _utilizing_ it difficult. Does charity liquidate and purchase goods & services now (either via BTC or USD it doesn't matter) or HODL? What is most the most "bang for btc" option?

7193 2018-01-08 16:02:25 Too bad they didn't just switch to Ethereum. bitcoin blockchain currently only does 3-5 transactions per second. Ethereum is doing double that. We can atleast move our 12 hour and 30 dollar transactions to 6 hours and 15 dollars by switching crypto :p
7194 2018-01-08 16:02:23 Looking like #Tron gonna come out that top ten soon. My pick either #RDD or #DOGE might make a jump soon.

7215 2018-01-08 16:01:18 It's interesting to see how one can profit so much while doing jack shit. Crypto still remains volatile and the moment you invest in it, Think of it as your money has vanished into thin air.People expect a lot from this and don't fully understand what they're throwing money at.

7311 2018-01-08 15:55:30 The reason people panic sell in #crypto is coz they’re betting money they don’t actually have. We call them “weak hands” and they make us rich 
7312 2018-01-08 15:55:27 @1a Fools scared about Bitcoin/Crypto while having no understanding of Fiat, Federal Reserve Notes, and Economics.
7313 2018-01-08 15:55:25 3. What if crypto bubble is going to be taller (i.e. worse) and going to hit us sooner?
7314 2018-01-08 15:55:25 生きます…！生きます…
7315 2018-01-08 15:55:23 If there is no announcement it will end in another disaster..!! Really hoping to hear good announcement..!!
7316 2018-01-08 15:55:20 The news better be really, really good, lol.

Oh, crypto market, what a shitshow
7317 2018-01-08 15:55:17 すき
7318 2018-01-08 15:55:15 Mr Cramer, I heard your comments on CNBC this morning. I would be happy to have a conversation about crypto if you like.  I have a balanced perspective ranging from the trading markets to the technical aspects of the space. Regards.
7319 2018-01-08 15:55:14 So, hodl, right?
7320 2018-01-08 15:55:12 It is not, but this crash is not organic or natural correction. It can set market to correctional phase but most likely to bounce up and higher due to it being triggered by something small and weighed down by ignorance and panic. Should continue on dissipation of delusions.
7321 2018-01-08 15:55:09 $BOS : "BOScoin listing on Kucoin is imminent and will happen in a few days"

7324 2018-01-08 15:55:03 Yeah he keeps on trying to debate me on fucking crypto currency because I told him to chill out on blocking and shit talking
7325 2018-01-08 15:54:54 Thanks to Coinmarketcap excluding korean exchanges. All alts showed red and there was a selling frenzy by noobs and the bots. Now for the intelligent investor its like a golden time coz as they say Buy the dip sell the high ride the crypto wave #BuyBitcoin and #BuyMoreAltDips
7326 2018-01-08 15:54:53 Reason #713 that trading crypto is better than traditional stock trading is there’s no opening/closing bell!!  #bitcoin #NYSE #futures #forex #gold #ETF #NASDAQ #mining #Masternodes #247初詣 #cryptocurrency #blockchain
7327 2018-01-08 15:54:50 I bought 3 books on crypto.  Stay educated peeps!

7332 2018-01-08 15:54:24 who cares about the website? are we investing in web design or crypto technology? i dont need another bitcoin iota or ripple. stop scamming people with your bs coin

7336 2018-01-08 15:54:06 @1a is the limit of 21 million units limited to bitcoin or to the entire crypto currency. Does each new crypto currency have the 21 M limit

7338 2018-01-08 15:53:57 Once the Central Banks get involved and they will, Good Luck. When, not if, the IRS officially recognizes crypto, it will be taxed and not anonymous.
7339 2018-01-08 15:53:54 crypto got me rubbing hands like birdman but the anticipation is killing me.

7341 2018-01-08 15:53:53 @1a crypto will change the world.  Money is power and that is why governments and banks, control money and you have power over people.
7342 2018-01-08 15:53:49 Shorting BTC or any crypto is a death wish.  Going to $20k+ soon! 
7343 2018-01-08 15:53:47 Hey Ronnie, 
Happy New year , Subscriber here. Take 20% profits and flight to what ? Crypto (BTC) , stocks, cash , metals? If not can u put out note for us privately?
TY
7344 2018-01-08 15:53:46 Everybody needs to chill about the crypto prices today... it’s called market correction, you can’t have billions and billions of new dollars being pumped into this thing daily without experiencing a dip every now and then
7345 2018-01-08 15:53:45 It all depends on So called Monday News..if not it will be another disaster..
7346 2018-01-08 15:53:39 Not sure I agree with coinmarketcaps decision to not list Korean exchanges towards overall market cap.  Causing a lot of FUD and instability in the markets. #Coinmarketcap #binance #bittrex #cryptocurrency #crypto #cryptocurrencies #altcoins #altcoin #btc #bitcoin #marketcap #dgb
7347 2018-01-08 15:53:35 People are waking up and panic selling. So I’m buying more. #Crypto #High6Mission
7348 2018-01-08 15:53:30 You bet. Just Hodl. People over reacted as it looks like market cap decreased tremendously (as they decide to remove on if the biggest crypto countries).

7350 2018-01-08 15:53:23 Thanks Crypto Currency Guy... to the moon. for the follow! Feel free to ask anything from my expertise! If I can be of any help feel free to ask. Best Regards, Tom
7351 2018-01-08 15:53:20 Circular reasoning. There’s no other use until ... someone develops an effective one. Frictionless payments still make a lot more sense than store of value. Store of value doesn’t require taking on crypto risk. Treasury bonds store value & yield income. Munis do it tax free.
7352 2018-01-08 15:53:20 Haha I fairly doubt there will be a "top" for crypto.. not even 1% of people have invested in crypto yet, I wouldn't be worried about that.
7353 2018-01-08 15:53:18 Seeing some cappers starting crypto accounts and selling advice on those accounts. Please don’t get sucker bombed into that
7354 2018-01-08 15:53:15 I only pay for hookers, blow and weed with crypto. What kind of heathen uses fake promises made of paper from a corrupt treasury soiled with germs and other peoples Levimsole filled coke to pay their ladies of the night or for their bizness powder? doucebags.
7355 2018-01-08 15:53:12 xrp is not interfering with any of our other currencies available, if anything the publicity they are receiving is helping crypto and block chain tech get more mainstream... also it's mainly for cross-border transactions it's not taking over any other currency.
7356 2018-01-08 15:53:08 $IXT 持っておきたいけどhitbtcなのが二の足を踏ませる。

7357 2018-01-08 15:53:06 I think the biggest thing (for me) is, I don’t know any rich stock guys but I do know 4-5 guys who have become wealthy or rich off of crypto and they are just average guys. Bettors are in it for the money in the long run, they see the opportunity right in front of them
7358 2018-01-08 15:53:04 They are scammers

7366 2018-01-08 15:52:34 Bloody Monday in crypto. Nothing new. Hope you didn't sell. Hope you buy dips. Hodl on. Nothing to see here.
7367 2018-01-08 15:52:34 Is that the line someone has drawn?  Greenbacks ok to pay a hooker, but that line is crossed if paying with crypto?  Bwahaha...
7368 2018-01-08 15:52:32 All the good crypto not falling as fast!
7369 2018-01-08 15:52:32 Bro, koren exchanges makes up for 30% of all the crypto market. You don’t see flash sell off in other big coin. Accept the fact that people know it’s over valued and they see little hit of volatility and they wanna get out of the market to lock in profits.

7377 2018-01-08 15:52:10 $crypto Market Update pt 3 if BTC goes down 12% but you enter coins like $QTUM down 48%, you're getting a good deal for the exchange rate. Bought some $QTUM for market recovery "trade". Buy the blood / bottom and sell the euphoria / top.
7378 2018-01-08 15:52:10 Nothing much, just the majority of the crypto market following BTC downward. Don't worry though, USDT will be printed soon to revitalize the market.

7381 2018-01-08 15:51:55 Crypto ETFs . This will not end well as a mess of digital currencies enter the market. In the end there will be a handful left standing. Tech boom and bust all over again but with a new generation of investors with no memory of the event because they were babies or not even born.

7387 2018-01-08 15:51:37 and with talks of yuen-centered oil contracts shedding light sometime this year, crypto only opens up more avenues to grow more distant from the USD
7388 2018-01-08 15:51:37 everywhere it says this issue is causing crypto market to tumble
7389 2018-01-08 15:51:29 If you take a closer look at tron project and people behind it and their connections, definetly yes. But my guess is, TRX needs to be tested on smaller platforms so "big fish" do not spoil ther reputation if something "fails untested". Probably will partner up in next 2-5 years.

7414 2018-01-08 15:50:16 #Coinmarketcap.com should have notified everyone that they were going to remove the Korean Markets from the calculations.  The crypto market is still over 700 billion so don't fret!  Buy what is on sale!  #cryptocurrency
7415 2018-01-08 15:50:09 That’s fair. All the fly by night junk should fail. But if crypto is like the internet, if decentralization is a core value, then let a 1000 different alternatives grow. One decentralized network is not enough. Is not true decentralization. So lumping all alternatives is wrong!
7416 2018-01-08 15:50:03 It does make sense slightly given the fact that everything was overpriced in Korea.

“What is happening now: correction dip + newbies panic selling = bloodbath. Always remember that what goes up, has to correct so it can go even higher next time.
If you could handle 500% profits, than you sure can handle 30% dips too”
7433 2018-01-08 15:49:28 Correct sir. One thing I’ve learned in my short time (9mo) in crypto #HODL #HODL #HODL and never short $BTC. Lost a lot of money doing that.

7501 2018-01-08 15:45:12 My clients are currently earning their yearly maximum picking coffee (~$7 a day). The idea that they should speculate on crypto, rather than investing in fertilizer for their fields is so insulting to how hard they work for each dollar.

nacl/secretbox states in the doc:"to convert a passphrase to a (32)key, use a suitable package like bcrypt"
But
crypto/bcrypt uses a rand number to generate hashes.
So, you can use bcrypt, get 32 bytes as key, but will never be able to decrypt between program restarts

7520 2018-01-08 15:43:56 Annnnd that's crypto for ya
7521 2018-01-08 15:43:56 Thought you switched to Crypto trades only?  What platform do you use?  I tried Poloniex and it won't let me log in at all.
7522 2018-01-08 15:43:53 
7523 2018-01-08 15:43:52 CMC definitely needs to be more transparent if they’re going to just remove every Korean Exchange from their website and cause hysteria because it seems like the market is crashing. Very deceitful, especially when much of the crypto community relies on the site.

7527 2018-01-08 15:43:43 CFI. I like the fact they're trying to create a secure ICO investment environment, which could easily attract new money if it works. Investors are not too secure about crypto and especially ICO's which are the fuel of the crypto economy, since everything starts there.

7544 2018-01-08 15:42:49 I am noticing a trend that most of these major crypto dumps seems to happen before lunch time. Are people hungry? Is that the problem? :P
7545 2018-01-08 15:42:45 Ive yet to understand why many #crypto and $btc youtubers post vids about the fluctuations of the marketcap and how billions are being poured in and out. I can panic buy a cheap alt, and move its cap by millions even though i only put in $100.
7546 2018-01-08 15:42:41 Some crypto as securities is right IMO. And until there is a useable product, I think calling it a security is fine.
7547 2018-01-08 15:42:32 電車降りる時だったからリバった時XRP-FXできなくて残念でしかないのよ…

Not because you hit big, but because crypto trading is sustainable enough with weekly profits?

7576 2018-01-08 15:41:18 @1a isn’t the bitcoin market dependent on its use in the form of dollars? if crypto currency relies on being converted into dollars before being used then it’s not as stable as some people make it to seem, right?
7577 2018-01-08 15:41:15 After this red day in #crypto there will be a hell of a green day! Brace yourself, buy some alts, next days will be yugeee

7614 2018-01-08 15:39:21 One of the biggest things I learned with crypto is definitely don’t invest more than your means. If you set aside $500 don’t go for the most expensive coins or over-diversity. Hold onto a couple you have researched and see potential in.
7615 2018-01-08 15:39:19 I feel like me becoming your friend before all this crypto was like me investing in bitcoin before it blew up
You’re a good friend to HODL

7620 2018-01-08 15:39:06 But $XRP, Tiffany IS conformity. It is the old using the new to conform back to the old. Its very existence is to stop or retain control over cryptocurrency, when you promote it you ARE Obeying, you ARE Following, you ARE Conforming and you will Fit In! 
Shame.

7621 2018-01-08 15:39:06 Everyone should know by now.. those weak hands in bitcoin are selling at this moment, and like @justinsuntron said, TRX is the top mentioned crypto on Twitter AND @SatoshiLite Just gave #Trx some major respect. Should be common sense for what's to come..
7622 2018-01-08 15:39:04 It’s true..he is the most undervalued gem  in crypto.

7630 2018-01-08 15:38:51 Almost ironically, #crypto can’t be treated like a typical “investment” but “investors are behaving just like any other financial market.

7635 2018-01-08 15:38:35 % agree but this will take time. For the average person they trust there banks so if it has Visa stamped on it they are more likely to buy crypto. Once they are into the ecosystem then they will realize the long benefits.

7639 2018-01-08 15:38:22 Definitely a wild day in crypto land. 2018 is a good #HODL if you missed out on the sell. Things will rebound, as we are still in wave 3 action (just started).

7642 2018-01-08 15:37:54 Doesn’t really make sense to not allow wealth clients to buy crypto on an unsolicited, non-discretionary basis. This would free the advisor of all liability and would be a attractive revenue stream.
7643 2018-01-08 15:37:54 韓国のbtcがガラッたっぽいんですけどねぇ〜
7644 2018-01-08 15:37:50 You don't need to buy a whole coin. You can buy $10 dollars worth BUT

because bitcoin is worth so much the transaction fees are creeping close to $10

ETH or XRP are less expensive and "safer" bets 

Crypto is volatile to say the least
7645 2018-01-08 15:37:47 Everyone should check out @FlashCoins as a huge upcoming player in the #cryptocurrency world. This coin has so much going for it. If anyone actually spent the time to research it instead of being a #shill they would see the #holding value of thie crypto,

Please tweet responsibly.
7750 2018-01-08 15:32:08 yes it is, people look at coinmarketcap and see everything falling and sell, it has already started recovering, people are absolute idiots when it comes to crypto, they expect 100% gains with zero drops

7752 2018-01-08 15:32:07 A quick update on what's going on!!

CMC (Coin Market Cap) excluded Korean exchange from the total currency circulation. With this reason crypto market crashed, it was strenghten by weak hands with massive sale outs

7762 2018-01-08 15:31:51 Nobody fucks with Ethereum! ETH deserves 2nd place rmore than XRP being just a token and it is not a crypto currency!!! So in fact it should not even be listed.
7763 2018-01-08 15:31:47 Crypto dropping like a rock, I'm at the dentist. Today cannot get any worse LOL. 

I hate the dentist. Being a drug addict for ~12 years really left its mark on my mouth. I hate this fucking dentist dude.

7766 2018-01-08 15:31:39 Sure, but their crypto-currency doesn't have to follow all the decentralization rules, does it?

Maybe they could tie it to centrally controlled servers for txn verification and bill it as “faster and more secure” that way?

7774 2018-01-08 15:31:08 @CoinMarketCap care to comment on your poorly executed decision which has brought down the crypto world today?
7775 2018-01-08 15:31:03 同じくです。
分かっていたのになぜ用意しなかったのか
「まさか今このタイミングで落ちるとは思っていなかった」ですね。
リップルは何回か暴落に近い落ちをみせているのでそのたびに同じ失敗をしてます。
次はもう失敗しないよう準備しておこうと思いますが、結局その準備金で草コイン買いそう・・・
7776 2018-01-08 15:31:03 @OracleOfCrypto what’s your feeling on the crypto market and BTC today?

7794 2018-01-08 15:30:24 @Valkyrae happy bday to my favorite crypto streamer
7795 2018-01-08 15:30:16 I still own some XVG - you will see that i also state numerous times that I believe XVG has great tech and poor marketing. Not all marketing is good marketing in crypto. Why you think TRX is falling right now? Same reason why I don’t see XVG going up in the coming days.
7796 2018-01-08 15:30:12 Crypto / USD market correction today is a prime example of why I won't be day trading: BTC loses 10% and I'm stuck in school.
7797 2018-01-08 15:30:12 Hang on a sec . . . 'a crypto wannabe Pan European party' - ooft!  Had no idea @NicolaSturgeon was hellbent on conquering western europe by tomorrow lunchtime.  Must have missed seeing that through the tears of laughter streaming down my leg.

7800 2018-01-08 15:30:08 really? so you are saying DOGE has a good future? Many  crypto investors saying that this coin was only made for fun. Im an not sure though
7801 2018-01-08 15:30:07 @BlockfolioApp you have to sort those servers out your app is becoming borderline unusable.
7802 2018-01-08 15:30:05 Crypto flash crash. r^2 is like .98.
7803 2018-01-08 15:30:05 Mate, this is what about crypto, high risk high gain. Sometimes you need to leap before you learn to walk. But of course be cautious.
7804 2018-01-08 15:30:01 $SRAX nice run this morning, Crypto flash crash affected it badly since, remember no PR yet on ICO rollout, so could still have life till then

7806 2018-01-08 15:29:50 Crypto market is blown away

Now the real investors will stay on,and the traders will retreat

There are rumors that CMC has caused these tantrum's,after removing SK exchanges... 

Traders will incur losses due to panic...!

7854 2018-01-08 15:26:57 I'm sure all crypto exchanges are making lots of money...so why is Kraken's front end still so crappy?
7855 2018-01-08 15:26:57 Please. Didn't mean to appear rude

7858 2018-01-08 15:26:48 The ENTIRE silly Crypto CRASH today is the result of a mistake by Coinmarketcap. No better time to BUY at cheap prices!

7870 2018-01-08 15:26:24 And this from LinkedIn. Bitcoin is losing crypto market share to other digital currencies.

7884 2018-01-08 15:25:44 Depends on the coin. Bitcoiner, ethereum holders are more accustomed to these drops. Ripple, not so sure. weak hands. Expect we will see a decent surge over the next few days however, ripple isnt looking too hot. Especially since its essentially not a crypto currency
7885 2018-01-08 15:25:37 @CryptoChoe if you have $1000. In which crypto will you invest? For short term. Same for long term as well. Thanks

7889 2018-01-08 15:25:30 For crypto geeks..... 1/3
Few hours ago Coin Market Cap removed Korean exchanges from their coin price calculations and being that all coins are about 30% pricier over there, it instantly tanked the price on CMC graphs.

7902 2018-01-08 15:25:02 Few hours ago Coin Market Cap removed Korean exchanges from their coin price calculations and being that all coins are about 30% pricier over there, it instantly tanked the price on CMC graphs #BTC #TRX #Xrp #ETH #Crypto #LTC #cryptocurrency

7922 2018-01-08 15:24:05 Will you finally sort this problem out? What a coincidence that this always happens when there is a significant market movement like crypto today.

7929 2018-01-08 15:23:56 So what do you think that How much this actually disturb the whole crypto market? I guess It will take some extra time to recover
7930 2018-01-08 15:23:55 But why do you make your entries now? If you are in BTC and both, the alt and BTC , are going down you doing get much of an advantage since sat value stays the same, or am I getting it wrong?
7931 2018-01-08 15:23:51 It very much is a hobby for them, and that's not wrong-- lines between work and hobby barely exist in new frontiers. Adoption rates for a small crypto like $SMC don't influence its value as much as speculation on its project value. Smaller projects build 1st and find users later.
7932 2018-01-08 15:23:46 Is this the January correction everyone is talking about? Crypto market is down today! Might be a good buying opportunity for those trying to get in. #Crypto #altcoin #ripple #xrp #StellarLumens #XLM

7953 2018-01-08 15:22:50 What's going on is a lack of relationship between investors and Tron Foundation. No legitimate information sharing = no trust in project = no new money.
7954 2018-01-08 15:22:50 Message for all new crypto traders/investors from a veteran. DO NOT PANIC. We have seen this type of volatility many many many times. DO NOT PANIC SELL AT LOSS. the market will recover. Wait, go away from the screen if you're too anxious. All will be OK.

8013 2018-01-08 15:20:49 Crypto-, from κρυπτός (kryptós) meaning “hidden” or “secret”. Not “digital asset used as medium of exchange”. I know we like abbreviations, but when people say “I’m into crypto” I think they mean cryptology and get excited for a second.

8063 2018-01-08 15:18:45 Sitting back watching these lows.. My estimated BT value is down a LOT today, not the least bit worried.. Today is a sit back and don't worry about it day. :)
8064 2018-01-08 15:18:39 All these crypto experts remind me of Tokyo Joe during the late 90s.  I used to go to his taco spot in midtown and watch him pump and dump internet stocks ... until he got pimp slapped.  The players, faces and products are new, the strategy, not so much.

8069 2018-01-08 15:18:32 there's not even a pause between them at this point; just one thing after another spins up; even the MSM jumped on the crypto bandwagon now.

8072 2018-01-08 15:18:24 South Korea, seriously? By trying to curb crypto trading, you will in the long run inadvertently create scarcity and eventually a higher demand and ultimately increase the price of crypto. The people will find a way to buy and trade. Your efforts are counterintuitive.....
8073 2018-01-08 15:18:23 I just think crypto owners need to be realistic here, not just XVG owners. Everyday all I see are charts about TRX, XVG, XRP, etc. charts only work occasionally - we are in a business where we deal with people and “bullish” charts only tell a small part of what will happen.

8112 2018-01-08 15:16:48 Probably the reasons:
- 1: Southern Korea checking the banks  related to crypto
- 2: Coinmarketcap adjusting prices
- 3: China about to shut down Bitcoin Mining farms (potentially)

And we’re potentially correcting (ABC) leads to this chain reaction. Just sit right and relax $BTC

8143 2018-01-08 15:15:24 I used to freak out when i first started crypto trading. But as time goes by u learn that this is all part of the game. Get the panic out of your system and itll be much easier seeing your coins drop and then gracefully shoot back up  $trx $xvg $btc $ltc
8144 2018-01-08 15:15:18 I think it's sick and sadistic that some in the #crypto world are happy when a certain coin goes down bc of their own detest for it and they are even more pleased that people who invested in these coins are suffering financially. It's sad to see people Tweet & act like this.
8145 2018-01-08 15:15:16 There is long term and short term profit to take into account. Poisoning the crypto ecosystem would not bode well for the longer term.

8150 2018-01-08 15:15:09 The moment you, a supposed mining/exploration company, started pushing crypto just now, is the moment you became uninvestable to me. Bad move, if you were hoping to secure real financing from real, intelligent investors. What a shame.
8151 2018-01-08 15:15:07 Leave crypto, if you can‘t deal with dumps. Or try to get used to that, and make your profits.. even in bad situations :)
8152 2018-01-08 15:15:02 Now is a VERY good time to buy Crypto. Thanks CoinMarketCap. Price rigging on a grand scale for whales lol...?

8200 2018-01-08 15:12:27 In my opinion, the risk/reward wouldn't make sense. Super high risk, lots of capital for low probability of making a difference. Who knows though, high stakes leads to major irrationality

8229 2018-01-08 15:11:44 Gday and thanks for this heads up. Please keep us updated for any more ICO's you interested in and we can do the followup research. BTW: humour in your vids are a ripper, have been forwarding to all mates.

8242 2018-01-08 15:11:13 Any medium/long term investments with 100$ a month to work with? I was thinking bonds or just an IRA account but if anyone has a sound idea hmu with your thoughts. DM or reply please (Trying NOT to buy bitcoin or any crypto currency)
8243 2018-01-08 15:11:10 I used to be a fan of James Altucher's writings on Quora but dude has lost his mind with the crypto market and trading that I am beginning to hate him.  So many lessons to be learned here.
8244 2018-01-08 15:11:07 Alternative crypto opinion:

- Definitely I would start it in Estonia
- US regulation... I have my own conspiracy theory about it, 280 characters not enough
- I don't understand what the hell people learned at college
- Many already gone
- Is a fact
- Not Blind, theory part 2

8257 2018-01-08 15:10:39 Jim, the amount of energy used by China and North Korea alone to mine bitcoin exceeds the entire energy production of the nation of Denmark. Crypto currency is championed disproportionately by bandits, sleezephiliacs and fascist dictators. It’s an unnecessary scourge to our plant
8258 2018-01-08 15:10:38 Keep going down... Bloodbath for the crypto today. 
In My opinion is a manipulation. DMM Soon , Coinsquare and BitOasis adding ripple . AND THEN Coinbase says no to ripple and CoinMarket Quit the KoreanValue , ( Asian Market , moves a lot of XRP ). Maybe im wrong.. #XRP #bitcoin
8259 2018-01-08 15:10:37 $DFS is the biggest gainer for today. Finally this coin is getting the attention that it needs from the Crypto world. @dfscoin team, your hard work finally paid off.

8294 2018-01-08 15:08:53 My new theory is that cryptocurrencies are closer to the opposite of what crypto people say they want. Less efficiency, less governance, and more chance for corruption. It is cognitive dissonance on a massive scale.

8361 2018-01-08 15:06:09 One thing I’ve noticed, and started hating about #crypto is the bullshit tweets by nobodies claiming inside info.

“BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR #LTC THIS WEEK!!!! IT’S GOING TO MOOOOON”.

Then comments by ppl gullible enough to buy based on some bot’s tweet. Reliable accounts anywhere?

8411 2018-01-08 15:03:31 Most people who criticize @officialmcafee  for buying hookers with crypto are either hypocrites or self righteous wankers (or both).
8412 2018-01-08 15:03:30 That’s a pretty spot on reason as to why some of the other coins don’t move
8413 2018-01-08 15:03:20 Appcoin!
8414 2018-01-08 15:03:18 Even if LN is EVER ready, it will require 'actions' from 'users'. They'll have to open channels, know whom/how much to allocate to each channel. Try explaining Bitcoin addresses to your parents, then add LN on top of that... impossible. #toocomplex

8462 2018-01-08 15:01:18 Bitcoin's fall is going to coincide with a market wide market drop. Those of you new to crypto (I know a lot of my XRP followers are) the key here is not to panic, if you're already down just hold and ride it out. It may take you time to recover, but you will recover.

8477 2018-01-08 15:00:39 So is the entire market dropping due to BTC loosing percentage in value?
8478 2018-01-08 15:00:38 exactly. XRB would be so much higher but everybody on kucoin wonders why mercatox price is so low and they are scared to buy. when the reality is we dont wanna sell below market price
8479 2018-01-08 15:00:36 @DiaryofaMadeMan now i need a mentor. Having made so many errors and lost in crypto... I just discovered testimonies about you. Now I am signing in on you. I NEED A MENTOR TO FOLLOW. I NEED TO BE PART OF THIS WEALTH TRANSFER
8480 2018-01-08 15:00:36 What to keep in mind at all times: cryptos are way more affected by speculation than other, conservative forms of investments. Hence, to see prices go up and down in extreme fashion shouldnt really worry you. Instead, use the time to do research on interesting investments.
8481 2018-01-08 15:00:35 All of a sudden everyone is poor and hates crypto. Happy bloody Monday!
8482 2018-01-08 15:00:34 Which one ?
8483 2018-01-08 15:00:33 Because it isn't fundamentally different than any other general purpose crypto. Facetious value or serious value, it's still value.

8505 2018-01-08 14:59:49 A lot of people just need to do more research. I read white papers and sometimes I still get pulled in under false pretenses. But I feel like a lot of the new people to crypto, that have no help from whales, buy these hyped coins and end up getting screwed.

8595 2018-01-08 14:56:49 I hate looking at market cap in crypto. With "just" 100 million USD worth of BTC you can literally flash crash the price below 4k on GDAX. It would not stay there, but that is definitely enough to cause a mass panic.

- Focus on crypto as securities is wrong
- Talent will begin moving abroad
- Belief in USD leads to slow currency adoption
- Nationalism blinds US to magnitude of the shift

Thoughts?
8640 2018-01-08 14:54:52 Days like today are great for checking out new #ICOs when hedge pot low.  Got to admit I probably love a pre-sale too much. But very drawn to #tradove #bbcoin. Lead gen such an enduring biz & top team. Have a look. #altcoin #Altcoins $btc $trx #crypto
8641 2018-01-08 14:54:49 How much were they?
8642 2018-01-08 14:54:49 正月休み楽しみました
8643 2018-01-08 14:54:48 When do you think there will no longer be a shitcoin market? btc 100k?
8644 2018-01-08 14:54:44 Dear God don't panic sell the only time i ever lost money on crypto's was when BTC tanked from 27k (AUD) and brought the whole market down with it, against better judgement i sold most of my portfolio hoping to buy in cheaper. this time its tanking and i'm playing skyrim #xvg
8645 2018-01-08 14:54:44 これはしばらく解決しなさそう…ううぅ、何で連休最後の日にこんなことに(T_T)
そうこうしているうちに資産も目減りしています…Binanceにあったのは100万円強程だったので、これは半分諦めておきましょう。
取引所を分散するのも大事かもしれませんね。
8646 2018-01-08 14:54:38 Gotcha. Yeah, I don't know. I'm not smart enough to deal with the garbage process that exists, I'm actually just paying someone to go through the hassle for me, to get a crypto in my wallet. Wish there was a service that did it for me though.
8647 2018-01-08 14:54:36 504じゃねえか
8648 2018-01-08 14:54:35 今日からまた取引開始
8649 2018-01-08 14:54:28 Crypto used in money laundering? Who knew?
8650 2018-01-08 14:54:20 I'm way not stacked enough to enjoy this 100% gain this week... dude nice at $1.90
Starting a high paying job this week, time to go shopping for crypto soon ...
8651 2018-01-08 14:54:19 飲み会前に握ってた通貨がXRPでよかった。これなら握り続けられる。
8652 2018-01-08 14:54:17 आप से crypto का advice मांगा और आपने life advice दे डाली,,,
8653 2018-01-08 14:54:17 Just remember in life, specially in crypto everyone has their own agenda, its not a bad thing but that is the truth.
8654 2018-01-08 14:54:16 急落時にインフルエンサーが下げ止まったとかいうのは多くがポジトークだと感じます。

超短期でロングを入れて売ればこれほど儲かるものはありません。このようなSNS上で相場を動かしてしまう発言はそのうち規制される気がしています。
8655 2018-01-08 14:54:15 I guess the right thing to do after the fork should be selling my ZCL, right?
8656 2018-01-08 14:54:15 Nearly $150 billion wiped off the value of crypto currencies in less than 24 hours
8657 2018-01-08 14:54:14 I wouldnt recommend to compare cryptos with each other to legitimize future growth. Instead, look at what the crypto brings to the table, where its strengths lie, whose backing them and how professional the entire setup looks to you and others.
8658 2018-01-08 14:54:09 Just love how the main stream media keeps shilling the most centralized crypto in existence $ripple 
8659 2018-01-08 14:54:08 so true
8660 2018-01-08 14:54:00 Power Ledger. Love love love it and would appreciate your analysis of it.
8661 2018-01-08 14:53:52 I don’t have a lot to invest in crypto but I’m glad I listened to you on this one and was able to get what I could when it was at $9.80
8662 2018-01-08 14:53:51 Ahhh good ole @CoinMarketCap manipulating the #crypto markets by removing Korean exchanges from their calculations.
8663 2018-01-08 14:53:50 $35 billion pulled from crypto market cap within 5 minutes from 04:52 UTC today. Started the current downtrend. Anyone know who has this kind of money...?
8664 2018-01-08 14:53:38 If that happens, I assume they will summon enough legal brain power to distinguish between a centrally issued crypto-NIS and your average decentralised assets/currencies/crypto-chips for tax and regulatory purposes
8665 2018-01-08 14:53:35 Doesn’t matter which crypto you are the #CMCredplague is going to infect you today.    #btc #eth #xrp #dash #ltc #ada #trx #bch #nem #xlm   Etc. Hopefully just a 24hour gestation before it burns out.
8666 2018-01-08 14:53:32 I think these giveaways are so cool. Its awesome to see people giving back and helping others get started in crypto.
Hopefully one day, I can win one of these or finally save up enough to get going on my own.
Either way, this is awesome.

8667 2018-01-08 14:53:23 Nice bag there my friend
8668 2018-01-08 14:53:21 Big battle in the crypto war today. wounded but holding ripple xrp
8669 2018-01-08 14:53:18 What are your preferred coins?
8670 2018-01-08 14:53:17 as far as I can tell, cryptocurrency is basically the only useful application for the full blockchain experience, and that's not a useful application in the first place. Look at the Ripple thing - it's a "crypto" therefore NUMBER GO UP even as it doesn't work anything like that
8671 2018-01-08 14:53:16 If u r ripple believer u will never be real crypto believer
8672 2018-01-08 14:53:16 When the bottom falls out there will be no bids and most will go to zero. The infrastructure of these shitty exchanges will crumble and we'll have a crypto winter. Not calling this yet, but soon enough. GLTA who keep their funds on any centralized exchange, fiat or crypto.
8673 2018-01-08 14:53:10 8000*

8674 2018-01-08 14:53:10 Enjoy man, as long as y don´t traffic humans ;-)
8675 2018-01-08 14:53:09 Just saying, that it might be a good idea to safe some pumping profits over time, cause we will always face market corrections. #crypto is emotional and curses can crash just in hours. That also means that they can recover in hours. #hodl
8676 2018-01-08 14:53:06 @jimcramer I can set you up with several bitcoin (and all crypto) experts!
8677 2018-01-08 14:53:05 Just the usual cycle of things in crypto, however I've noticed that the cycle seems to have sped up recently though. Why is this and what could that mean, anyone?
8678 2018-01-08 14:53:02 Hocam btc yorumu bekliyoruz
8679 2018-01-08 14:53:01 man $btcp can be a great coin my proble is with the zcl price atm

8699 2018-01-08 14:52:02 Every single top 10 crypto currency is in red today. Great opportunity to buy them cheap
8700 2018-01-08 14:51:55 Total slaughter house in #cryptomarkets today. People panic selling at record rates, putting crypto in hodlers hands. Supply of $btc after today getting ever smaller, cause once you sell you will never be able to buy it back at that price again later.
8701 2018-01-08 14:51:51 Does this work via referrals or you simple receive these dividends when owning the shares
8702 2018-01-08 14:51:47 It's WAY too early into the life of this coin. It's going to fluctuate just like everything else. It's only just getting started. I'm not worried at all. Dips and moons are all part of the crypto game :)

8707 2018-01-08 14:51:17 #monacoin  It’s very old coin since 2014 this coin is straggling at last it’s able to make his own value in crypto world but its real value is not this much when it’s real value will come to world then they will know what they missed in the pass
8708 2018-01-08 14:51:16 Seriously, where the fuck are you reading that from!? I never said anything like you just said! Do you skim-read? I suggest you get better at it cus you seem to be reading words that aren’t even there!
8709 2018-01-08 14:51:10 Bitcoin miners now have 13,000 times more combined number-crunching power than the world’s 500 biggest supercomputers. What happens when the crypto currency bubble pops?
8710 2018-01-08 14:51:09 Guess RSI too hit for all the crypto, out and waiting for bottom
8711 2018-01-08 14:51:04 I love red days. When your weak hands are panic selling my strong hands are scooping up your coins at discount and strengthening my position. Keep selling. I'll buy $XRP and $TRX all day long.  #xrp #xrpthestandard #trx #HODL #Crypto

8716 2018-01-08 14:50:54 Works if it's $BTC. For other #altcoins can't hedge and exchanges are nightmares. Would like to hear of an experience in withdrawing meaningful amount (say >$100K USD of crypto gains). My suspicion is cryptos more often exchanged into other cryptos than fiat. Far more often.
8717 2018-01-08 14:50:54 今日は暗号通貨市場の10%(8兆円程度)が市場から資金が流出していることになります。一度Fiatに逃げているだけなので、そのほぼ全てが短期で市場へ戻ります。

底で突っ込めば下落幅の1日で資産が約5%増、2週間以内には約10%増加するボーナスタイミングであります。
8718 2018-01-08 14:50:49 Корпорация Microsoft с сегодняшнего дня больше не принимает Bitcoin в качестве оплаты. Основными причинами называют  высокую стоимость транзакций и очень большое время совершения операций. #btc #microsoft #crypto

8757 2018-01-08 14:48:42 Blockchain will very likely change all industries, and create new ones. Crypto? Probably will transform finance, and much else too! We have only one certainty, that millions will lose bigly if they get their Entry & Exit timing wrong.

8841 2018-01-08 14:43:21 its a substantial investment. the coin is backed by a huge userbase, a very legit whitepaper and overall obviously underrated as it is not listed on coinmarketcap as of now. This leads to some panic sells ppl will regret later on, remember: the product has a userbase of 200m ppl

8851 2018-01-08 14:42:38 To new people in crypto#: do not panic, there is some profit booking in the #crypto #market.
Yesterday day was 820 Billion and today we are at 770 right now. So 50 billion has been pulled out as profit booking. Which is about 8% of total #market value.

8937 2018-01-08 14:36:25 一言で言うならば、仮想通貨のヘッジファンドを計画しています。リスクを鑑みずに単にリターンを最大化するというより（そのような手法は個人でレバレッジを大きくかければ可能）、コイン間の割安割高判断を取り入れリスクリターンを最大化していく「賢い」投資手法を取ります。
8938 2018-01-08 14:36:22 Good to hear from you. I finished at Warwick. Crypto is good so far but my favourite coin XRP is taking a hammering. Patience is the key ingredient for big rewards

8943 2018-01-08 14:36:10 You really need to already know how to buy crypto like BTC and ETH and then move it between wallets safely. If you can manage that, then you should be okay.
8944 2018-01-08 14:36:07 @officialmcafee what about #PAC @PaccoinDEVs

8948 2018-01-08 14:35:50 What chart is that? I use Binance and they don't have $doge. I can't find a good to-the-minute chart on the coin.
8949 2018-01-08 14:35:49 Crypto is really interesting to me, but the thing that scares me about it is the possibility of a vulnerability being discovered and massive security breaches.  I mean, what happens if the entire blockchain gets compromised?
8950 2018-01-08 14:35:49 The Crypto currency Cordano ADA. I have been nerding out on this stuff. Keeps me up late. How you doing? I was just at Dusts place for a couple days.

8952 2018-01-08 14:35:35 Interesting to see conservatives/libertarians/whathaveyou’s preach against globalization in the traditional sense, and yet foam at the mouths over the idea of globalization of crypto.
8953 2018-01-08 14:35:35 Sell walls are bullish. Means the whales want to keep the price low for longer and accumulate more before letting it rip.

8956 2018-01-08 14:35:05 Investors often feel urged to buy a certain coin when the price is being pumped up and end up allocating a lot of over-hyped and often, illiquid assets. Tip for new investors: avoid overtrading and FOMO! (fear of missing out)

9023 2018-01-08 14:28:37 In support to my view that #Bitcoin is significant as a network, not a harbour: 
Gain Capital re-announces OTC Bitcoin trading rollout: shares rise 15%

#BTC may be a bubble but crypto-infrastructure has a meaningful impact on expected future cost of capital. That's here to stay

9029 2018-01-08 14:28:25 Great! Just trying to find out something about the crypto correction. Not a peep so far anywhere. Just a Coindesk article about BTC going bearing after not holding 17K over the weekend.

9032 2018-01-08 14:28:19 If we wanted *just* speed, many of us wouldn't be in #crypto, I assume. Meanwhile, what we want is a true innovation of many different systems that prevailed for far too long. Humanity, one step *further.*
9033 2018-01-08 14:28:13 I got one for sale too

9035 2018-01-08 14:27:59 If you want to invest in crypto, invest in blockchain plateform like ethereum , EOS, Zilliqa(ICO - it can be new ethereum) not in app which use blockchain plateform like bitcoin, because app can fail, but blockchain technology is gona last for sure,

9046 2018-01-08 14:27:03 Funny you post this cause just the other day I had a friend who isn't into crypto yet tell me he wants to invest in doge cause it's only 0.01$. "If it goes to $0.50 ill have made 50x my investment. Plus it can't go below $0.01right?". Tried to talk some sense into him...

仮想通貨取引はFXやってた人なら楽勝だろ！チャートの動きからその後がある程度予想出来るから数年FXやってた人は余裕だと思うんだよね！

9091 2018-01-08 14:24:02 @BMBernstein Brilliant article on crypto market cycles! as someone who has been in this space for less than a year it helped me understand the unease I’ve felt watching some of these shitcoins go up, BTC will have another turn soon I think.
9092 2018-01-08 14:23:59 I never joke, you know that
9093 2018-01-08 14:23:58 I wonder how many millions of coins are being thrown away at a loss to jump on the coin of the week right now #silly #crypto #sigh

9095 2018-01-08 14:23:37 This guy @officialmcafee is to crypto what T-Bag was to GATE as Cole Pfeiffer in Prison Break.
9096 2018-01-08 14:23:31 Sorry, but no. Exchanges are not liable for your losses. You trade at your own risk. By using exchanges you accept the risks of their servers going down, their software failing, their charts/price not being accurate, their staff stealing your coins...
9097 2018-01-08 14:23:23 Golden rule of crypto investment. You don't loose if you don't sell.

9113 2018-01-08 14:21:58 This is the year Cryptocurrencies blow up. It's unstoppable. Crypto is taking over the world. You either dive in early or wait for the tides that will never come back. No second guessing here.

9116 2018-01-08 14:21:43 I generally refuse to call crashes because There is little upside to calling some crashes because the majority of the time you are wrong and when you are right everyone says how obvious it was in the rearview... but Crypto looks to be setting up for a big crash #Timestamp

9137 2018-01-08 14:20:25 Crypto is modern day Weimar. Everyday billions of new crypto is created out of digits (thin air)! It doesn't even need cartel to pop this bubble of idiocy. It will happen on it's own. Lolololol
9138 2018-01-08 14:20:14 @bitmaintech We are extremely disappointed by this business as they gave no support at all to their customers hit by the ban of crypto-currencies and mining in their country.
All they gave is"we can ship back to another address. But you have to pay for shipment and 50% China Tax.
9139 2018-01-08 14:20:13 Fuck a crypto hit a lick on discord 
9140 2018-01-08 14:20:12 @CryptoEddie_SA interested in sharing your passion and knowledge of crypto? We have a youth business forum we’d like you to speak at in DBN. Please DM if interested.
9141 2018-01-08 14:20:06 I just wanna know why I can’t find these cool things to use my little bit of Crypto for
9142 2018-01-08 14:20:06 lol
9143 2018-01-08 14:20:00 Cannot agree more. When it was in the mid 180s few weeks ago I made a conscious decision to invest in the options rather than any Crypto currency and man am I glad.
9144 2018-01-08 14:19:56 そうなんですね。見ましたが今は上がりそうな雰囲気ですね↗︎
9145 2018-01-08 14:19:45 Looks like all Crypto-currencies are in big trouble.... 
Big correction in offing...
I may be wrong...
9146 2018-01-08 14:19:34 I love watching stock market people try to force some sort of 1:1 analogies on the crypto world and do it with some sort of made up analogy. These are also the same people who have been saying forever that crypto isn’t real and that it’s all “made up” and won’t be anything
9147 2018-01-08 14:19:31 Congrats ;)

9151 2018-01-08 14:18:56 Crypto market down over 100 mill from its ath, you know what that means right...discounts on crypto today!
9152 2018-01-08 14:18:56 ~20% $BTC dominance = $alt top? hmmm
9153 2018-01-08 14:18:51 I completely agree the institutions/ Governments have an agenda that is to discrediet BTC bring it to its knees and they have unlimited resources you just have to look at what's happened since they have got involved ... clear as day to me... I ment TA no clue
9154 2018-01-08 14:18:49 I am a trader I do not use cryptocurrency for paying, so most of the balance is kept in exchange ( bittrex, binanace, poloniex, HitBTC & GDAX) so even if anyone confirms the fork for a coin I used to transfer my balance to that exchange.
Hope you find your answer. :)
9155 2018-01-08 14:18:48 Thanks for the Info. I am waiting for a rebounce, than i'll Cash out. Btc is going to 8k before it hits new ATH 's.
9156 2018-01-08 14:18:43 What is @BETRBetting? BETR is the betting crypto-currency that will establish truly decentralised sports betting on the internet.
9157 2018-01-08 14:18:42 Great question today: Is #crypto a bubble and sooner or later will crash?

What do you think?

My view is: Nature works in waves. Dinosaurs came & went, Rome came & went, Nokia came & went. Crypto just came & will go.

The important thing is to ride the wave and profit now! #btc
9158 2018-01-08 14:18:40 Friggen frustrating POS exchange. Can't deposit, can't sell, can't buy, can't withdraw, can't transfer. Yes can eat all my ether through fees. Thoroughly recommend buying into ICO
9159 2018-01-08 14:18:35 99% in #crypto is shit , we trade shit in #cryptos & u can't analysis/differentiate one shit from other . 
it's all same with little tweaks .
9160 2018-01-08 14:18:35 Are you dumb? I said violence is wrong. But he did to a person who has shown aggressiveness and had “goons” with him.  Its almost like me going to Mike Tyson and record him at the mall. And he knocks me out. So tell me where I defended tha rapper?
9161 2018-01-08 14:18:18 to all the new crypto rich, donate some of your wealth to charities.  give to TAC

9162 2018-01-08 14:18:18 @GeminiDotCom I’m trying to deposit money into the exchange but it says im over the 500 daily limit yet I’ve made no deposits in the last 3 days
9163 2018-01-08 14:18:15 I have. I've been following Ripple and crypto in general since as early as 2013. XRP is little more than a white collar scam from my observations.
9164 2018-01-08 14:18:04 Nothing like waking up to your portfolio down 15%. Good morning to you too crypto!

9172 2018-01-08 14:17:50 If we can find ways to handle either fare payment, tolling or transportation finance through crypto dollars, this will be on!
9173 2018-01-08 14:17:35 @officialmcafee it's funny how fast the #crypto community went from believing you were some kind of guru, wanting you to name _insert coins their holding_. To short on all your calls and having no faith in any of your calls
9174 2018-01-08 14:17:32 have you gotten the DTs yet from the crypto addiction ?
9175 2018-01-08 14:17:29 Buy more crypto
9176 2018-01-08 14:17:15 Never one from Binance!!!!
9177 2018-01-08 14:17:04 LOL you gotta love it though!
9178 2018-01-08 14:17:03 As for server crashes, that's one of the issues crypto tokens are trying to solve - decentralization means removing central points of failure. So long as the network is run on nodes spread around the world, if a group of them goes down, the network can still function
9179 2018-01-08 14:17:03 Yikes. Sorry, dude. I mean, I wouldn't lump crypto in with the alt-right, but yeah. The Dice man, no good.
9180 2018-01-08 14:17:02 That was quick
9181 2018-01-08 14:17:00 How newbies start in crypto! Buy the cheapest coins: $XRP, $ADA, $TRX, $XVG. Hope they follow $BTC price. Follow @officialmcafee, buy the tops and become a bagholder.
9182 2018-01-08 14:16:54 I cry

9185 2018-01-08 14:16:44 Instead buy a 5k stove, invest 35k in crypto currencies, buy 100 40k stoves later.
9186 2018-01-08 14:16:41 In the world of crypto, a soft touch gets ignored.

9188 2018-01-08 14:16:37 That’s what I expected 
9189 2018-01-08 14:16:36 What crypto did you use to make payments ? BTC/LTC/XMR ? May I suggest paying hookers with DeepOnion ? 
9190 2018-01-08 14:16:35 This is a fair point.. it's just the lack of consistency, which leads to market manipulation that bothers me
9191 2018-01-08 14:16:20 Oh shit. Crypto sale this morning
9192 2018-01-08 14:16:07 Would be nice if you could credit my (big) STORM deposit from 2 days ago? Ticket #150024 . Its sitting inside your wallet but not credited to my account.

9195 2018-01-08 14:15:49 This does make a lot of sense. It feels like most people are not reacting to this part though, but are just pissed off that they price suddenly dropped on CMC.
9196 2018-01-08 14:15:43 Why not just release it ratherthan telling us you will today?  What time will you release and on what medium? Why are people so cryptic around hear?
9197 2018-01-08 14:15:37 I have something set for every milestone. The first thing I'm doing is quitting my job to teach bitcoin/blockchain and work consulting crypto marketing teams.
9198 2018-01-08 14:15:33 S.Korea is very liberal so not much negative should come from this. Their president wants them all to trade as long as its not during a lecture at school.

9213 2018-01-08 14:13:54 The thing that would surprise most people is algorithms do a lot of the trading today - so when it looks like $4 billion in trading volume + $30 billion in market cap disappeared over night - it triggers these algorithms to start selling off. Issue is it's market manipulation

9217 2018-01-08 14:13:45 Switzerland ain't bad - we pay no taxes on Crypto gains ;)
9218 2018-01-08 14:13:43 Nothing's stopping you from doing any of those things. The idea behind a crypto token is to align incentives of all network participants, though. Sites like crunchyroll and the pirate community have different incentives, so they frequently clash

9232 2018-01-08 14:13:08 Thank you for saying it precisely. Hopefully the designers here make sure that repurchase is only at some revenue-based price, as tying liability to speculative price of crypto is not going to be fun. :)

9257 2018-01-08 14:11:21 Great news for #crypto!  China is about to ban cheap produced coins thus forcing prices to rise.  People are about to get destroyed when prices start going back up when the market realizes what the news means.  #Bitcoin #ethereum #litecoin #coinbase #gdax #bitcoincash

9259 2018-01-08 14:11:17 It’s funny you bring up crypto because 80% of the value flowing into Bitcoin comes from the Japanese yen. Due to the fact that market isn’t regulated at all there’s a bunch of large traders bidding up/ spoofing and dictating the pricing. It’s crazy bro lol

9281 2018-01-08 14:09:09 Much coin. So hate.
9282 2018-01-08 14:09:02 @officialmcafee the evolution of @dogecoin is the inverse to you as a crypto advisor. Started out credible, ended up being a joke.
9283 2018-01-08 14:08:55 @swissborg Hi, you seem like a really nice ICO to me, tho - I dont like that you attached your name to John McAfee on the trailer, he has a huge negative effect on the crypto world, i advice you to consider removing it. Any different exchange coming? HitBTC is a mess too.

9380 2018-01-08 14:02:44 The recent bump in crypto trading is probably the doing of people, for the most part, who don’t understand blockchain. They’ve just been told by people who kinda do that it’s a “great” way to get rich quick.
9381 2018-01-08 14:02:40 Why is #litecoin and other crypto's all down? Did I miss something?

9454 2018-01-08 13:57:31 Crypto bloodbath this morning... except for #ethereum
9455 2018-01-08 13:57:31 Appreciate your input Chris. As of now despite the slight drawback at #ETH, it's still at $107B vs #XRPs $95B. The numbers change due to the volatility as you mention. Any guess/thoughts on why we expect #ETH to rally further this year? What are your expectations? #crypto
9456 2018-01-08 13:57:30 Most lotto winners are from the working poor. Crypto investors are mostly geeks. Believe or not, the exchanges and storage scare most people away.

9459 2018-01-08 13:57:21 しかも仮想通貨は24時間毎日動きます。この中で調査し、リスクリターンを最適化した戦略を考え、執行することは本業が他にある個人投資家にとって難しくなってきていると思われます。更に今後マーケットが上がり一本調子じゃ無くなってきたときの対策が練られていない人がほとんどだと思います。

9537 2018-01-08 13:50:02 No, its not even a crypto.... it lost 30bn in market cap while I slept.
9538 2018-01-08 13:50:00 欧米では既に175本の仮想通貨関連の投資ファンドが設立されていると聞きます。世界の中でも早くから関心が高く、投資額が大きい日本でまだちゃんとしたものが無いのはおかしいという問題意識の下、ファンド設立を計画しています。
9539 2018-01-08 13:49:55 I’m impartial on location. Would you please DM me.  I’m a successful entrepreneur that specializes in sales. A bonus is I’ve lived and travelled all over the world. @xvgwhalereal

9546 2018-01-08 13:49:18 BTC and ETH down 8% and 3% respectively, LTC is down 10%.
9547 2018-01-08 13:49:15 USDT_ETH price DECREASED to $1055.340000 on #poloniex. New alerts (+/- 4.000 pct) set at: UP: $1097.553600 - DOWN: $1013.126400 $eth #eth #ethereum #crypto $crypto $btc
9548 2018-01-08 13:48:59 Isn't flash that crypto owned by your buddy marshal?
9549 2018-01-08 13:48:55 I think you need a few more indicators 
9550 2018-01-08 13:48:54 Negative, crypto will show to be uncontainable.
9551 2018-01-08 13:48:35 BTG、一切買う気にならないんだけど仮にbF上場したらどうなるかなー。おそらく同じか前後に対象者には付与されるんだろうし、売られるだけじゃね？と思うんだけどイナゴその他が寄って来たりするんだろうか？
9552 2018-01-08 13:48:29 BTCのドミナンスが低くてアルトに資金が流れてたからなかなかアルトは踏ん張ってて悪くない印象
9553 2018-01-08 13:48:29 You list yourself as an Independent Journalist as I see, so why not write about the coin? There's enough superficial "shit coin"-BS on twitter, it could be helpful to see some actual journalistic work about it. Would also be more productive than twitter-arguments.
9554 2018-01-08 13:48:16 Seems a strange way to run a crypto. Not for me
9555 2018-01-08 13:48:10 Just silence yourself. We can tell you’re a crypto noob who saw one shill of bcash and thinks its “the real bitcoin”
9556 2018-01-08 13:48:05 Respect John - as a British you are about the only real American I know, you really promote freedom and I respect you a lot for it. Why they so shocked about crypto, look at the wars they made.
9557 2018-01-08 13:47:53 @alex_bomber94
9558 2018-01-08 13:47:49 If he is so confident then why can't he buy all these coins with $10k and wait to become multi millionaire in 3 yrs? Why is he charging 2000 dollars to give some recommendations on crypto?
9559 2018-01-08 13:47:46 Not the best day for crypto markets. Should we see a turnaround soon? Maybe not that soon but sure we will.      $XRP $LTC $BCH

9561 2018-01-08 13:47:34 Hallo Roel, 
Doel je op blockchain/crypto? Bij banken onderling doet het overboeken van van geld één werkdag. Instant is helaas nog niet mogelijk.

9562 2018-01-08 13:47:33 Crypto shows how cults exist some of these coins have followers like scientology its amazing to observe the herd mentality is scary lots of people do not think for themselves these days... so many zombies.. alts will fall soon long live ltc!!!
9563 2018-01-08 13:47:30 Stu it’s not letting me follow you
9564 2018-01-08 13:47:23 I’m a bit jaded with crypto at the moment.  The value of bitcoin has just run up so hard. 

Still love the technology though.....
9565 2018-01-08 13:47:14 Look at $SMART (#smartcash). Will add masternodes on thursday.

9580 2018-01-08 13:46:23 In a couple weeks @cloverhound will release a PoC / mobile app for paying merchants with #crypto.  The experience is very smooth.  #Paypal4Crypto
9581 2018-01-08 13:46:21 もう一段下げてくれれば拾っていきたくはなるかな。173くらいまではナンピン覚悟で拾っていこうかなって感じ
9582 2018-01-08 13:46:21 The best #cryptocurrency @youtube s right now @crypto_bobby and @DougPolkPoker these guys are good!!! Go give them a sub
9583 2018-01-08 13:46:10 Mmm...not really. Gold has never fluctuated as wildly as crypto, and to find phenomena like this in the dollar you'd have to go back to the great hyperinflations.
9584 2018-01-08 13:46:03 So today, if you have $usd buy if you have #crypto in the red #HOLD .
9585 2018-01-08 13:46:03 わー！ふぁぶさんにフォローして貰えてる(((o(*ﾟ▽ﾟ*)o)))
9586 2018-01-08 13:45:51 Who are we to judge how you spend - at least you’re transacting in crypto!
9587 2018-01-08 13:45:42 What use is a #crypto #currency if it takes on the shape of a #collectable.

If crypto currency is to survive it needs to reshape into a power that can purchase the hearts of the people and empower them.

9588 2018-01-08 13:45:41 @krakenfx please allow access to the market in Korea. We would like to sell #xrp there for much betrer prices!! #crypto #btc #stopmanupilating

9594 2018-01-08 13:45:33 No problem. Just show your appreciation by buying a pair of crypto socks. Support the #soxchain or just retweet the main post. :-)
9595 2018-01-08 13:45:28 They're akin to the Antifa or Wahabbists of crypto 
9596 2018-01-08 13:45:12 Learning is earning #crypto
9597 2018-01-08 13:45:10 @CoinbaseSupport yo why can't I buy or sell any crypto on My account?
9598 2018-01-08 13:45:04 1ヶ月くらい待つのが普通みたいですね、、気長に待っておきます(´ω`)
9599 2018-01-08 13:45:02 Congrats for new investor.. #btc now is yours.. #DYOR and you are not the noobs actually.. Sometimes amateur is better then expert.. And expert sometimes is totally #noobs #crypto for all
9600 2018-01-08 13:44:57 Should be a caveat here, all TA is subject to the movement of $btc and whether or not #bitcoin will ruin the party
9601 2018-01-08 13:44:56 Sounds like jealousy to me ! Sounds like awesome documentary... forget surviving on crypto for  lets make partying on crypto.I volunteer
9602 2018-01-08 13:44:53 America had one of the most broken and unfair tax code in the world...I feel someone who has no idea what is going on wrote it... especially when it comes to crypto. If the tax code was fair in general, less people would try to find was not to pay.
9603 2018-01-08 13:44:38 Closed.
9604 2018-01-08 13:44:28 Wow, I have literally never used Reddit as a source of information for $crypto. The bitcointalk thread and project chatrooms (slack, discord, telegram) are where most discussion takes place. Developer announcements are usually on a bitcointalk or project forum.
9605 2018-01-08 13:44:27 Wrong Crypto- #madetough a better option 
9606 2018-01-08 13:44:22 I think there's still space for #bitcoin to grow in the following months and even years. That being said not sure if by the end of 2018 will it still be the #1 #crypto. We'll see..
9607 2018-01-08 13:44:13 Crypto Moon hasn’t even begun! All of these exchanges trying to get ready for the onslaught!
9608 2018-01-08 13:44:07 Mainstream is horrible...
9609 2018-01-08 13:44:05 Several comments on $OSTK perma haters:

Loss of credibility in that:

1. $OSTK is the only crypto related issuer they bash. 

2. Bashing is primarily predicated on personal issues which go back a decade +.

3. One actually engaged in short-distort in terms of facts being off.
9610 2018-01-08 13:43:46 Wirklich mega coole Aktion deinen Zuschauern einfach zu ermöglichen in die Crypto-Szene einzusteigen! :)

9612 2018-01-08 13:43:25 Same happened with me also...
9613 2018-01-08 13:43:19 Do you think it really matters which Crypto Currency I invest in? Are some really much better than others?
9614 2018-01-08 13:43:16 that's it!
9615 2018-01-08 13:43:08 Where to follow the losting dates?
9616 2018-01-08 13:43:08 Hard to invest in @raiblocks when they pRtner with scam exchanges like @MercatoxCom completely robbed 1/3 of the initial investors. Buyer beware
9617 2018-01-08 13:43:06 ・アルトコイン→ビットコイン→フィアットによる下落：全部似たような割合で下落
・ビットコイン→フィアットによる下落：ビットコインの下落だけ大きい（アルトコインは上がる場合もありうる）

との理解で良いのでしたでしょうか
9618 2018-01-08 13:43:06 主戦場はコインチェックとBinance なので…ホクホクしておきます笑
9619 2018-01-08 13:43:00 goodmorning #cryptolovers - een wat somber begin van deze nieuwe crypto week. Laat ook zien dat koersen zo maar 50% kunnen dalen in korte tijd. Kijk bv naar #Qtum van $106,- naar $58,- in 36 uur. Goed om dat te blijven realiseren en op tijd ook wat winst te nemen.
9620 2018-01-08 13:42:59 You from india or nigeria? Which scammer are you promoting con coin bin coin #Xvg? Obviously a fake profile like @crypto_sarah9
9621 2018-01-08 13:42:56 Crypto Fight Club: @PeterLBrandt vs. @parabolictrav . Let's make this happen.
9622 2018-01-08 13:42:55 Wonder what peeps are hedging into lol. Was talking about the the other day. Dollar strength could throw a cat amongst the pidgeons for all crypto
9623 2018-01-08 13:42:47 and cancelling all european crypto debit cards furthers this how...
9624 2018-01-08 13:42:47 Everybody: Yay we're having so much fun trading and investing. Crypto is so nice.

Bitcoin: Nice bed, let me shit in it.
9625 2018-01-08 13:42:30 Time for the give away?
Better fix my Telegram app as its broken.. 
9626 2018-01-08 13:42:28 bought $XLM DIPP !!!
9627 2018-01-08 13:42:23 The bears of the Street are pushing their corrections down this morning across all major coins.  Expected, but getting to be a pattern that crypto has to break out of in order to see real long term growth.The revolution won’t be stewarded by weak hands.  #HODL #Litecoin #LTC
9628 2018-01-08 13:42:20 I sure bittrex will support the fork to avoid people jumping exchanges but keep an eye out for news
9629 2018-01-08 13:42:04 #exrn cheap coin

9637 2018-01-08 13:40:55 Lots of smoke and mirrors in crypto land
9638 2018-01-08 13:40:48 I think it’s time to take them to Reddit and Facebook. To get shit on. So everyone can realize how much of a scam this exchange is. @xrb @raiblocks @MercatoxCom @SatoshiLite
9639 2018-01-08 13:40:42 Loops, thoughts on $PPC & $TRC? I'm sure you've checked them out already.
9640 2018-01-08 13:40:42 新規参入者はここで狼狽売するよね。こんな下げはもう何度も見てきたよ。だけど、これ以上の上げも何度も見てきた。もっと市場が大きくなれば今よりは安定しそうだけどね。2018年はまだまだ上がると思ってます。ただ、ビットコインはわからない。 #仮想通貨 #暗号通貨

9657 2018-01-08 13:38:57 You can now instantly tip any @telegram user and generate a Waves wallet for them! And they dont need to do a thing. All they need is an active Telegram Alias. Like MAGIC!  #wavesplatform #WavesNG #crypto #InstantPayment #WavesLove #BlackTurtle #WavesGo #WAXEX #WavesTipping
9658 2018-01-08 13:38:42 This whole crypto currency revolution - either we are all in this together or we are not - support each other - change the system!
9659 2018-01-08 13:38:38 You are honest and doing lot of good things as well. Not many people can admit it on public domain, just keep doing good for the crypto world and if you can forgive xvg for there mistakes as well.
9660 2018-01-08 13:38:36 Soon a public company will create a tradeable crypto token.
9661 2018-01-08 13:38:35 What does it mean in simple English though ?
9662 2018-01-08 13:38:16 no way haha DO YOUR RESEARCH and BELIEVE!!

9665 2018-01-08 13:38:05 Also my advice to everyone is, follow @Poloniex and @binance_2017 and turn on their notifications so as soon as a new currency is added, jump on 100%+ wave
9666 2018-01-08 13:37:59 $GCAP #Bitcoin offering available in Australia and Singapore following launch in U.K./Europe and Bitcoin futures in United States, sees completing global $BTC rollout in coming months, will expand crypto offerings to include #Ethereum and others in 2018.
9667 2018-01-08 13:37:52 2018. Forget bitcoin or crypto, just bet on Dustin Johnson or Jon Rahm  every week. @Bamfordgolf
9668 2018-01-08 13:37:48 #myaddress was posted only for fun purpose, if she decides to Give away some #Tron for real then i would love to see one of my follower winning these....!
9669 2018-01-08 13:37:45 No its not open at. Or might be problem with the link.
9670 2018-01-08 13:37:35 Doesn’t matter. $XRP was never intended to be a currency. Isn’t exactly a #crypto. Both statements made by the CEO. It was overbought. Should have never reached this price.
9671 2018-01-08 13:37:31 We want #rdd listed on @binance_2017 .
9672 2018-01-08 13:37:31 #bitcoins is Crypto Currency 
9673 2018-01-08 13:37:30 It should have never been listed on shit exchanges such as Mercatox. If kucoin & BitGrail comply great. @Mercatox is Robbery. It is NEVER ok to scam people or take people’s money. Can’t believe Raiblocks would be Ok. Shows what they stand for. No communication #shitcoins
9674 2018-01-08 13:37:27 Manmanman.... Laat je niet opnaaien Ed!
9675 2018-01-08 13:37:23 Is #Facebook gearing up to makes its own #cryptocurrency ? Should they integrate with existing #blockchains ?

News flash . Either scenario is bullish for #Crypto & #Facebook.  

More Legitimacy to the market, more firms will follow, more #Blockchain mergers. 

Thoughts? 
9676 2018-01-08 13:37:19 That’s depending on if bittrex supports the fork. No news yet. It would be wiser to purchase zcl through fork vs btc though as btcp is 1:1 for btc and zcl. Zcl is much cheaper than btc.

9678 2018-01-08 13:36:52 I'm tired of all these family members, friends, and random people asking me to teach them about crypto. I have been harping on it for five years and now you want to listen??? This is NOT a get rich quick scheme. This is a fundamental change for the better of humanity.
9679 2018-01-08 13:36:51 lol you really think businesses are switching to BCH.... wake up

9685 2018-01-08 13:36:04 Im specifically talking about the people who entered the crypto market three months ago when bitcoin was booming. You’re the late bloomers. You’re the people me and my friends reck when instruments are pumped. HUMBLE your ass down before you truly get rekt
9686 2018-01-08 13:36:00 Anything can happen, many will be lining up to buy up those magical dips 
9687 2018-01-08 13:35:59 $SNC 4x TODAY ! If you still think " I was too late to buy ", you foolish as it will place new exchanges in early february.

9698 2018-01-08 13:34:38 its because coinmarketcap removed korean markets from cmc and everybody panic sold
9699 2018-01-08 13:34:33 下げるねぇ〜（笑）でもまだまだガチホですね。まだ何も始まっていない。これからはリップル主導で牽引されていくと思ってます。ただ、今後はより性能や実績が重要になってくるはずです。本当、開発されていないコインは危ないと思う。 #仮想通貨 #暗号通貨

9704 2018-01-08 13:34:14 What happened to this f.ckin market again.. Everything is going down.. #Cardano #ADA dropped almost 20% in 2 days. Bitcoin is going further down.. What the hell??? #Crypto #cryptocurrency #altcoin #altcoins
9705 2018-01-08 13:34:06 looking up a #crypto that was up 75% on the day. i checked out the website cool. valuation cheap. then i did 10 mins of research founder refers to him self as expert in publishing. looked up his linked in. owns an autobody shop. Didnt even bother to change his LINKEDIN. #ROFL
9706 2018-01-08 13:34:03 Crash is scheduled undoubtedly... But in crypto commodities, not in Equities...in stock mkts it'll only be healthy corrections

9709 2018-01-08 13:33:38 What is a realistic valuation of #XRP and #TRX in say 12/18 months. Both seem well backed. New to #crypto so still learning/seeking advice finding. BTW put into both #holding

9713 2018-01-08 13:33:26 I swear I hate crypto traders. I’ve been doing this shit for over 3 years in multiple markets, you and your little bitfinex account can come suck this dick. Talk to me when you’re able to trade private debt and derivatives LIL BITCH #fuck #crypto #traders

9716 2018-01-08 13:33:21 I could not buy any crypto. it keeps saying "Insufficient Funds"
9717 2018-01-08 13:33:13 That's really bad. Even a "normal" bank has an emergency hotline or can be reached during business hours.
I think that would be even more important to something like crypto currency traders?!?
9718 2018-01-08 13:33:05 @parabolictrav at least your followers count is going parabolic  just have to wait for $BTC to catch up
9719 2018-01-08 13:33:03 I could not buy any crypto. it keeps saying "Insufficient Funds"

9728 2018-01-08 13:32:18 I'm gonna need #Litecoin and these other #altcoins to BOSS UP and get their weight up.

9740 2018-01-08 13:31:14 That’s a decision you will have to make. I have my strategy, and it may change before hand. News coming out almost daily with a peak in interest of btcp. Entry looks a lot better here vs yesterday.
9741 2018-01-08 13:31:11 I guess as soon as all the major exchanges get their capacity upgrades done and open new user registrations and/or full speed service, the $crypto alts market will see at least one more SUPER PUMP. 

Do you agree?

9757 2018-01-08 13:29:17 Agreed. More likely to create their own. Exposing 2 + Billion people to crypto could actually be something positive. We ll just have to make sure they dump FB for something else ;)

9764 2018-01-08 13:28:28 As more capital flows into the crypto space and approaches fever pitch bubble territory, we must not lose sight of the poor, the under educated, the malinformed, and the people who aren’t afforded the opportunity to participate, that this space can deeply assist.
9765 2018-01-08 13:28:23 Preach man. I’m tired of people coming to me for help then questioning the 3+ years I’ve been doing this for over 2 months trading a bullshit 300 dollar crypto account

9776 2018-01-08 13:27:09 There are several other sports betting operations that operate in the crypto space but we differ in one significant respect – we take no percentage of wagers and no margin. We purely facilitate a peer-to-peer bet. #BetterBettingICO
9777 2018-01-08 13:27:08 You know that the point to crypto is to make BTC not USD, right?

9825 2018-01-08 13:23:03 Haha Nabilla en promo d’un site de crypto monnaie !! Allez zouu là bas .. L’univers est sérieux et risqué, c’est pas des produits détox ou du maquillage !
9826 2018-01-08 13:23:01 ブログのつかいかたをべんきょうしたので今日は寝ます
9827 2018-01-08 13:22:47 The thought isn't all too far-fetched. The recent news showed the interest of FB in #crypto and looking at their track-record, they try to do everything themselves. I could actually see a FBCoin or something in the future. Either that or buying out another and re-branding it.

9830 2018-01-08 13:22:07 Verge is one to keep an eye on Also, its not for a short term investment more for the long run..i want to invest in to a fairly new crypto currency which is about to fly up in value. Got a few on my mind already, whats everyone else thinking?

9832 2018-01-08 13:21:59 ねこーーー
すごく悲しいです。
日本中で、野良猫が人間から石ぶつけられるとかふざけて叩かれるとか
そういうことが今もあるのはわかっているし悔しいけどゼロにはならなくて

でもこの子は飼い主からやられたんだ、と思うとあまりにも悲しすぎます。飼い主がそんな事……

9847 2018-01-08 13:20:26 @btcfork Bitcoin is the best store of value and will keep being that. It’s really great at being digital gold and that’s not changing any time soon, especially since it’s the standard to trade any other crypto. BCH sucks as currency too

9852 2018-01-08 13:19:56 unlikely to happen but still the price will go down a little more further before rising up maybe 14500
9853 2018-01-08 13:19:56 One of the first questions I get about crypto from newbies to the space is"How do i buy ripple".  With the massive influx of new buyers to the market, I see XRP continuing to pump well into 2018..

1- محفظة ورقية

9881 2018-01-08 13:16:51 You are right! Lisk and Strat are the 2 best plays this year as their tech will get implemented with companies. The question is which one will get to $100 first.

9884 2018-01-08 13:16:18 Bitcoin and crypto might actually accelerate the implosion of the dominant economic paradigm. Civilizations seeking to rival the hegemony, should make use them and grow strong while liberal modernity destroys itself.

If you bought after my tweet, you can sell it and book your profits. :)

9905 2018-01-08 13:14:44 The protection I talk about is not from loss as a result of trading activity. Why can't we replicate the powers of company shares  through tokens? Coin holders should be much more than bag holders, who are hoping for new bag holders to offload tokens to at a later time.

9963 2018-01-08 13:10:38 In crypto probably few, once it becomes a more stable sector it will become a much better indicator like it is in commodities and shares. One has to try pretty hard to lose money in crypto just now.
9964 2018-01-08 13:10:34 Alex but what is the point of investing in DCN when i have to exchange it with ETH? If I want ETH i buy ETH, but i want DCN and keep it in my private wallet.

9973 2018-01-08 13:09:48 @officialmcafee you legend, Dont see why prozzies should be excluded from crypto. Don’t be shy to follow back.
9974 2018-01-08 13:09:42 I am a bitcoiner. I started this organisation because I want to free myself and others from the oppression and quite frankly the slavery of fiat. This WILL NOT happen with digital gold

I don't care about this crypto brand or that. I care about achieving the goal of emancipation

9981 2018-01-08 13:09:02 past few weeks I started to play les PUBG and focus more on researching crypto. 
Results: I trippled my portfolio. But I gotta step it up another notch if I want to hit a million this year
9982 2018-01-08 13:08:56 All crypto currency are down! That means time to buy! #cryptocurrency #Bitcoin #Ripple #XRP
9983 2018-01-08 13:08:51 Peu importe la tendance, la hype ou le projet se lancer dans une coin sans recherche c'est débile et dangereux. Surtout que Romain n'a pas non plus des années d’expériences en crypto donc plus d’éléments pour appuyer son avis c'est pas de refus
9984 2018-01-08 13:08:47 Düşüş trendinin sonuna geldiği kanısına vardım ben hocam. Kendi içinde dibin dibinde gibi. Periyot seçimim 10 bu arada tabi onu da diyeyim
9985 2018-01-08 13:08:47 As far as I'm aware @binance_2017 is closed for new traders.
