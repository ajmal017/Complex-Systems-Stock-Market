181 2018-11-25 18:24:05 Removing the 1:1 will lead to inflation that is way worse than what we saw in October. It will lead to people losing money in their bank accounts and leave us with no currency at all to trade in (we are dominated by rtgs and ecocash). We don't have enough forex circulating
182 2018-11-25 18:23:58 But the buck starts with govt, tobacco farmers and gold dealers get foreign currency but govt quickly converts it to Rtgs though at 1:1, but it is still an increase in rtgs, those with access to forex  converts it to Rtgs on black market

311 2018-11-25 13:25:22 Okay, again I do respect a "theory" :) . But "the Financial world" is not an entity. Besides that, for a lot of big players in Forex (especially Citi, Deutsche), XRP is a nightmare. The fact that Ripple is targeting the smaller players is for a reason, to move from the outside.

374 2018-11-25 11:41:30 For once reply this one: what guarantee do we have that the efforts we make to bring back forex into the country is not the land it into some individual's pockets? 
375 2018-11-25 11:41:21 Will there be a Govt Bank to provide USD those who would like to clear their goods at the respective borders; i.e. at 1:1 rate, because it doesnt make any sense to pay in forex when coming into Zimbabwe and when I can use the local Bond or RTGS. Please can you explain?
376 2018-11-25 11:40:34 I didn’t dispute their travelling to SA & it’s not the point. They get forex allocation from Reserve bank why charge in usd then ?
377 2018-11-25 11:39:33 That's a weak-ass argument. What about those who bought cars last month or before, what forex ar you going to use for their fuel? This is what happens when a government addresses symptoms instead of root cause

385 2018-11-25 11:25:36 ForEx — di kita maintindihan :(
386 2018-11-25 11:22:44 So is it ok then for them to get forex allocation at rtgs 1:1 and then hard currency
387 2018-11-25 11:17:35 What is being suggested is that the RBZ is the address where importers access forex presumably at 1:1, in which it is argued there is reason2charge in forex becoz the only source is RBZ. The logic then goes that bond notes are acceptable tender becoz RBZ pays exporters in them.

389 2018-11-25 11:14:21 Can I use my bond as the forex it represents so I can pay duty at 1:1?
390 2018-11-25 11:12:12 Correct where I went wrong 
391 2018-11-25 11:11:24 You tried
392 2018-11-25 11:08:29 But I Thot everything we used foe tender in zim was forex. Is there another type of forex out there? Or that's acceptance of the bond as the official Zim currency?

431 2018-11-25 09:43:51 No means gvt won't rely upon on exporters retained forex to fund some critical imports. Stop issuing TBs, try fund deficit in forex bonds, limit banks ability to borrow ( impose reserve ratios). I don't see money supply increasing worse with increased taxes.

437 2018-11-25 09:27:43 The bottom line is you are dollarising the economy through the back door. If I pay duty in Forex I sell in Forex. Now where do the majority of the people including the civil servants paid in RTGS get the elusive Forex from? Add to that threats of a ten year jail sentence.

726 2018-11-24 18:21:08 Only makes good sense cos the reason he gave for that measure was allocation of forex to productive sectors and concerns. If l did not get that forex allocation from RBZ how then should l be charged duty in forex.?

740 2018-11-24 17:30:56 Do you think by gvt demanding tax payments in Forex 1:1 has not been removed?
741 2018-11-24 17:28:00 USD leakages can only be called leakages when the USDs originate from Zimbabwe. RBZ shouldnt ring fence diaspora remittances from friends and relatives and pretend they are preventing leakages. People should spend those remittances as they wish. Gvt can opt for duty to be forex.
742 2018-11-24 17:27:24 Problem it's isn't the duty of government to import anything for us. They moment they introduced controls on Nostros and started "allocating forex" that doesn't belong to them things went south.
743 2018-11-24 17:26:56 We only heard about him, but rumors said that its someone powerful and influential and he is trying to cause division in the presidium and also causing suffering of the general populace by holding huge sums of forex and directing it n black market
744 2018-11-24 17:17:09 Is there any logic in this or any parallel universe that dictates that if one has got enough forex to import something,they automatically also have enough of it to pay duty in forex??

750 2018-11-24 17:03:47 Well 4 starts some of the vehicles that were bought in bought abt employment.

890 2018-11-24 11:31:54 When I saw the list of goods whose duty and vat has to be paid in forex my mind told me that the government has thrown the bond note under the bus without saying it. So if I import and my duty is in forex I am forced sell in forex or close down. Think on that.

896 2018-11-24 11:18:12 I totally agree there. Same thing with the law of jailing illegal forex dealers for 10 years. Parliament was bypassed and did not even get anyone reacting from the legislators yet they are busy singing slogans and all sorts instead of addressing serious issues like these.

926 2018-11-24 10:10:43 our economy is depressed and does not have enough forex reserves to maintain it at 1:1. A floating exchange rate is best fit for a depressed economy like ours. It reduces the burden of frequent intervention and improves mkt efficiency by making it easier for capital to flow.

984 2018-11-24 08:35:20 My view also on the forex duty on motorists . It’s the customers people who have an opportunity to take in millions from back hands . When you make things tough for citizens , it’s those at control points who smile all the way to the bank

988 2018-11-24 08:33:07 In other words why have a cheap car which u can't afford fuel for, u can't afford to feed your family or any medicine. Before the US era vehicles were paying duty in forex. People did it then, so what's so special now
989 2018-11-24 08:30:17 And how do u propose to fund that? Remember we only have bond note & rtgs. All forex that is raised will be used to pay debts by @MthuliNcube
990 2018-11-24 08:29:29 The problem is u don't consider the fact that fuel is what drives the economy. Expensive fuel means expensive everything.
The point was just the payment of duty in forex also benefits the car owners in the long run. He wl also buy cheap bread, mealie meal etc

1014 2018-11-24 07:39:30 When did my money in the bank cease to be forex? I have never deposited RTGS into my account but the bond note was forced onto and now somehow my money has mutated into a local currency that does not exist in statutes
1015 2018-11-24 07:38:17 Kkk depending on your source of income fuel in Zimbabwe is either the cheapest or the most expensive in the region.
If you get paid or receive forex of some sort it will be way way cheaper.If you get an RTGS  it’s expensive as long as its 1:1
It just shows kuti nyika yaora

1032 2018-11-24 07:10:56 It's not illegal to trade in forex or get remuneration in forex. Isolate issues, the trading of forex has been  made illegal because of the impediments it creates especially to those who have no access to forex
1033 2018-11-24 07:10:49 Even if we tried to have a 100% US economy it's not feasible because the dollars just aren't there. Let those that have the capacity to trade in forex do so in all aspects of their business. We are earning as a country that much forex but using most of it an retaining so little.
1034 2018-11-24 07:07:14 Iwe we are in a multi currency regime. USD is not forex here . It is one of the currencies in the basket. It’s legal tender at par with bond . The bond is a government creation, they must accept it unconditionally. Why do you support theft by the government from the people?

1041 2018-11-24 06:53:17 Spar OK, TM will import prawns in forex, pay duty in forex but cant sell in forex instead Rtgs. They go back to RBZ and they are told prawns are not on priority list meaning they have to get forex on black market yet it's illegal to do so.

1045 2018-11-24 06:47:59 At some point you mean these car importers are buying those vehicles on bonds or RTGS ? Those vehicles are bought on forex my friend, so wat ever source they use to get the forex is the very source they have to use for paying duty
1046 2018-11-24 06:46:00 Its rather absurd to do so under a multiple currency system. Exchanging currencies can be informal but definately not illegal. A large percentage of forex inflows are informal. In a fee market system the government should rather incentivise inflow of forex.
1047 2018-11-24 06:44:44 ZIMRA is taking advantage of the budget announcement which is wrong & illegal. Their demand overnight for people to pay in forex who had already imported their cars is a violation of not only common sense but the law. Such institutions must be fixed corruption in them is rampant.

1057 2018-11-24 06:19:37 If forex is the issue, make it easier to open bussiness. Convince your own  citizens to invest their skills and produce. They want FDI because it's easier to loot, and they know they can't motivate people.
1058 2018-11-24 06:18:42 If i get paid in Bonds / RTGs where do i get the forex to pay for the duty ?
1059 2018-11-24 06:16:20 Economics 101 says forex is generated from exports or foreigners coming into your country (tourism). 
Zim Economics (2019 Budget) says forex is generated from nationals' import duty & local companies' VAT returns.

Your issue appears to be the cumbersome process of which needs to be done if you want to clear your car in rtgs/bond before the forex requirement takes in place 6 weeks.

1094 2018-11-24 05:26:57 It's because of the haphazard & evil policies by @MthuliNcube

1096 2018-11-24 05:23:51 Where did you get the forex to import the vehicle? 

I think the same place you got forex to import the vehicle should be the same place you get forex for duty is it not? 

If you can’t then you have no business buying a car. You can’t afford it. 

Adjust your life accordingly.

1132 2018-11-24 04:14:45 Forex & Stocks are cousins
1133 2018-11-24 04:14:24 @RModiByoSouth How will people channel their forex to the productive sector when GoZ is busy looking outside for investors whilst it's failing to recognise it's own investors. A good example of a neglected investor was Maxwell Chikumbutso of Saith Technologies.
1134 2018-11-24 04:14:15 That's all good but since buying/selling forex on the road will get u in jail for ten years wre are we meant to get the forex ,ku bank hakuna and our salaries are in RTGS bond
1135 2018-11-24 04:14:12 Am baffled hear this: When one claims he has enough stock of a product yet he hasn't paid for it whether RTGs or forex and customers are waiting for the product means there is nothing. Delays in forex allocation means mmmmmmm. Watch out!!!

1140 2018-11-24 04:08:55 The only silver lining amidst this doom & gloom is that oil is at a one year low of under US$60 per barrel No #SLGovernment can control this factor. Exchange rate can also be defended only based on forex reserves/FDI and willingness to hike #LKR interest rates
1141 2018-11-24 04:03:54 Don't get u mate, so if govt collects tax n duty in forex how does it th urn 2 rtgs for salaries? Unless they burn the forex
1142 2018-11-24 04:03:36 Asik amat. Gua embat ajah 2m 2 taun mainin forex.
1143 2018-11-24 04:00:05 Simple example would be - if tomorrow forex derivative trade is stopped fiat currencies wouldn't lose their value. There may be fluctuations but the currency still retains its value as a mode of consideration. However, bitcoin would most likely immediately turn useless to most

1146 2018-11-24 03:55:28 There are only two solutions to the Economic Crisis in ZW ,that is ZW should join a Common Monetary Area or print its own currency(Zim dollar). This will ease the forex shortages since the ZW dollar would be internationally competitive.

The amount of discount varies by region & varies due to customs, forex, taxes, etc. Given our COGS on an EEG, it’s amazing it’s $159!

1250 2018-11-23 22:51:12 Hi! My mistake. In US Muse reg $199 sale $159, $40 off. That’s literally as low as we can go. In Canada its reg $249, sale $179 Canadian, $70 off. The amount of discount varies by region & varies due to customs, forex, taxes, etc. Given our COGS on an EEG, it’s amazing it’s $159!
1251 2018-11-23 22:50:44 Does trading so many pairs against JPY not give you anxiety (not literally, of course)? I only trade 5 forex pairs with no overlap, so 10 separate currencies

1437 2018-11-23 18:49:04 Is thst supposed to make me weep or what? You actually think that even matters at all? We are simply telling u that if it's from outside for non-productive purposes u pay duty in forex! Period! Didn't u see we lower duty for buses? Doesnt that communicate something to you?
1438 2018-11-23 18:46:48 Coz u exported our forex for non-productive purpose. We all know that u are not importing the car for business purposes n thus the forex u exported has basically gone to waste. Not gonna be earned back in any way. So u hv to pay back a bit of that intp the formal system via duty

1442 2018-11-23 18:40:57 I don't think paying in forex is the problem. The problem is, the same government that's paying you in rtgs & bond notes charging you in forex.
1443 2018-11-23 18:40:54 1/2 We have a law which says bond and USD are equal,then we have another one which says duty on imported vehicles to be paid in forex!

1499 2018-11-23 17:41:41 OH (2 workers at Smoothie King): “I already lost most of my money in the stock market; I can’t lose the rest”
“Nah - trading Forex is different - just watch the video - you can start trading Monday”

1500 2018-11-23 17:41:36 Our economy is very confusing .    Kant do we have a currency our own? They say we are in a multi currency economy. How come does the USD become forex? What motivated the introduction of bond notes? What purpose are they saving?
Economists please help.
1501 2018-11-23 17:41:05 It the government wants forex payments in their official transactions then they must let it be available in legal sources like the bank. Bcoz they tacitly acknowledge that the bond and $US are not at par they should at least allow the banks to trade in forex, that way it's legit

1503 2018-11-23 17:40:35 That’s true, and it’s wrong. They do need to be honest about how different the rates actually are. But I do see it as a way for them to fill up reserves with forex without dishing more out. It’s an unconventional way of fixing the irregularity we currently have.
1504 2018-11-23 17:40:27 At the end of the day the top 3 are likely to go up in value. Else why would these institutions be investing into Eth, xrp and BTC. They know more than you and I. 
You believe in BTC I guess from your comments. And I respect that.
I'm xrp, I hope we both make money long term.

1507 2018-11-23 17:38:43 It's because they have their own currency that they can manipulate with the aid of other fiscal instruments. Bcoz we do not have our own currency that is difficult.  But having contradictory positions just makes the situation worse. My take is if the government wants forex paymen
1508 2018-11-23 17:38:33 "All those people making money before, thank God for MB o, they were just gaming the system. Now that he has mopped up excess Forex and sanitised the system..."
1509 2018-11-23 17:38:19 You are the biggest joke, so unrestrained by your unimaginative brain. A lot of people in the UK send second hand cars to their relatives in Zimbabwe and beyond on the deal that you pay duty yourself. How are we supposed to source the forex then?

It does not come back. You find something else to export, in the hope that you end up with more exports than imports. Forex should be earned through exports, not through duty, fees, and taxation.

1707 2018-11-23 14:55:29 TD Securities 1/2: For the #G10, the bigger rub stems from the fact that both #EUR and #USD score poorly on our short-term growth signals. This dynamic keeps $EURUSD contained but reinforces trading macro on the crosses.
1708 2018-11-23 14:54:11 TD Securities: $GBPUSD, for  its part, still remains a buy on dip even though Brexit headlines  increase two-ways risks.
1709 2018-11-23 14:53:56 TD Securities: A mix of data and political headlines have dinged the European currency complex. The #EUR has taken the brunt of the drubbing, reflecting a poor set of PMI data. It made another push below 1.14 as a consequence and HFFV points to buying interest around 1.13.
1710 2018-11-23 14:52:49 Rabobank: In 2018, the USD established itself as the favoured safe haven  currency.  While the greenback is likely to remain well supported  against a number of currencies in an environment of low risk appetite,  we see good reason for the #JPY and the #CHF to outperform in 2019.

1713 2018-11-23 14:49:38 Accordingly these people are sourcing their own forex, l dont see how their consumption preferences affect forex reserves held by the government. One has to bring cash to the bank to do a foreign tt payment or pay cash to import a car.
1714 2018-11-23 14:49:25 On free market forces Bond/RTGS will depreciate against USD to its real value (market determined). This will create money shortages since we dont have enough to back bond printing or forex  to use instead
1715 2018-11-23 14:47:37 With all due respect , it’s the double standards of this government  that makes people furious. Is the bond 1:1 with the USD is the root cause of the confusion . So Whether l can afford to pay the duty in forex is not the point and quite frankly none of your business .
1716 2018-11-23 14:46:58 I stand corrected but these people dont get their forex from RBZ which collects forex for Tobacco exports and diaspora remittances. As such your argument becomes incorrect. People are getting forex on the parallel market to buy cars.

1845 2018-11-23 13:21:24 I doubt that. Speculators by nature are short term players. All that has to be done is to enforce exchange control and do all currency trades thru bank. You won’t be able to buy forex to hold short term so no real room for speculators

1847 2018-11-23 13:18:05 You have multiple currencies. The outside supplier deserves their demand to their specified currency. The govt on the other shud b paid from any one of the official currencies, especially their own creation RTGS and Bond @ 1:1 with USD. There technically is no forex in Zim
1848 2018-11-23 13:16:46 TRUE THIS IS A CRUEL GOVERNMENT IT PAYS TOBACCO FARMERS WITH RTGS STEALING REAL US$ THEN SAYS RTGS IS THE SAME AGAINST US$ BUT YOU ARE PAID BOND NOTES FROM THE BANK.THEN IF YOU IMPORT A CAR THEY WANT DUTY IN FOREX  FROM WHERE NOW?YOU ARE CORRECT THEY ARE DAY LIGHT THIEVES.

1850 2018-11-23 13:16:08 Kana bond ne $US zviri gedye-gedye like they tell us,there should be no problem paying duty in bonds.Simple.
When buying the car,buyer has no option but to pay in forex.But here in Zimbabwe there is an option to use the bond which is 1:1 with the greenback.
So they must take it!
1851 2018-11-23 13:16:06 The problem is when gvt protects wealth by maintaining 1:1 but denies the same value when we pay taxes. Why do we fool ourselves? Let the current balances be ringfenced for gvt to pay later. Float the bond if you need it. No use gvt forming a Committee to allocate forex!
1852 2018-11-23 13:14:29 $EURUSD broke below 11/20 low which exposes 1.1316 - 1.1288 area next in the pair. 1.618 ext. is at 1.1243 #Elliottwave#Forex $EUR

1901 2018-11-23 12:28:41 Bannockburn: A break of 20d moving average (~$0.7220) would likely signal a retest on the month's low seen near $0.7165.

1904 2018-11-23 12:26:43 There is no consensus as to when the forex duty on imported vehicles is supposed to start..is it immediate or there is a transitional period.I think its only fair to give those whose vehicles were on the way a grace period...
1905 2018-11-23 12:24:54 Bannockburn: dollar is little changed on the week against the yen.  It finished last week near #JPY 112.85, where a roughly $765 mln expiring option is struck. Technical indicators are still heavy, warning of near-term risk to return to the week's low set on Tue near 112.30.

1950 2018-11-23 11:39:52 The problem is not paying in forex but a gvt refusing its own creation.
1951 2018-11-23 11:39:45 Maybe the point she's trying to make is that the duty payments are not foreign payments where the only option is to pay in forex.
They are a local payment done here in Zimbabwe where there is the option to pay in bond notes which are 1:1 with the  $US as the authorities insist.

2070 2018-11-23 10:24:42 Which would be ideal if the ordinary Zimbabwean is paid in forex, but they are not!! 

He's moves to strategically eliminate the bond note has an painful bearing on ordinary Zimbabweans
2071 2018-11-23 10:24:13 cde never law is law whether just or unjust. @lwa u can not criminalise forex trade were @law a multi currency regime is in place. ts just as good as arresting a person giving sm1 change. juntarisim doesnt apply @law.
2072 2018-11-23 10:22:39 Fuel prices set 2 hike, which will have a bearing on all sectors. Excise duty 2 b paid in forex when salaries are paid in RTGS and bond. Not to mention a gvt which is already taxing it's citizens for electronic transactions as if they choose not to use cash. Like really?

2075 2018-11-23 10:17:36 I assure local costs are at least 40% of production and any imports too will need duties in the end 50% will be liquidated. The problem with setting a % is forex requirement differ per operation. All this is being caused by the 1:1 problem.
2076 2018-11-23 10:16:54 Give us a break Musuri Ncube...your bond notes are illegal instruments why are you demanding forex for payment of duty yet Zimra is a government institution....
2077 2018-11-23 10:16:50 Of you can source forex to purchase a vehicle, perhaps source for the duty too
2078 2018-11-23 10:15:49 They use the scarce forex to import cars, thereafter they want to import parts and accessories,  and fuel. They say they are lowly paid civil servants, but they afford cars. Forex should stay home. If it takes flight, it should be for productive purposes. Thanks Mthuli Ncube.

2089 2018-11-23 10:07:36 Yes austerity measures can be a way forward. Critically asses the budget and what austerity means.its not government expenditure they are arming to reduce rather its individual's. You can't pay workers with bonds etc and expect them to pay with forex

2338 2018-11-23 07:51:36 You are importing in forex pay duty in forex period. Don't be lazy thinkers arguing for the sake of arguing.
2339 2018-11-23 07:51:17 They are just a bunch of fools ruining the country and economy even more, i mean where are civilians going to get forex when the banks don't give you forex and dealing forex is a crime. This country really needs prayers
2340 2018-11-23 07:50:57 With all d money generated .from d car park to point of departure..d airport is smelling,Ac are not working ... and many foreign airlines smiling away with forex made in Nigeria ...what a shame ...how will take Efcc to arrest the AirNigeria people that Abandon that project
2341 2018-11-23 07:50:56 So if you are buying outside the country with forex, what stops you from paying duty of the same good in forex?
2342 2018-11-23 07:50:11 The brokers @ GSI Markets whould like to inform you that: As of November 22, 2018 at 07:50AM, 1 EUR equals 1.1416 USD. #gsimarkets ##forex #fxtrading #currency #eur #usd
2343 2018-11-23 07:49:28 Some budget highlights:
✓ Private vehicles import duty to be paid in forex.
✓ Civil servants 13th cheque to be paid before year-end but based on basic salaries only.
✓ 'Boarder Gezi' 2,917 youths to be retired by year-end.
✓ 5% salary cut for government senior officers.
2344 2018-11-23 07:48:50 You can't buy in a foreign country without forex and you can pay duty with bond notes in Zimbabwe. It's ok because bond is said to be equivalent to usd. This is the sign of bond notes failure
2345 2018-11-23 07:46:56 So according to this figure, a handful of people looted more than half of a nations GDP and are walking free? 

Then a civil servant is at risk of spending 10 years in jail trying to buy forex off the street to buy medicine?

This witchcraft is POTENT!!!!!!

2412 2018-11-23 07:11:37 Where do you even get the forex if they pay you in bond/RTGS and ngapha it's a 12 year sentence to be seen buying USD.. lol
2413 2018-11-23 07:11:31 Why not totally phase out bond if they believe that people have that forex ? Since their theme is 'austerity for prosperity' we are ready to face that austerity as long we have clarity and vision of where we going...
2414 2018-11-23 07:10:53 Hon. Minister of Finance it's best to accept reality. Bond note is not equivalent to USD. Be on the ground and stop confusing people. Just give bond note a reasonable exchange rate against other currencies. Duty in forex explains it all. If you refuse to accept bond then who shd.

2430 2018-11-23 07:01:04 If RTGs and USD is 1:1 so why paying duty with forex 
2431 2018-11-23 07:00:45 The pay cuts, duty in forex, increase in fines all have questionable legality.
2432 2018-11-23 06:57:55 My point is if you are importing it means you have access to forex ka, so sematengero awaita zvinhu neforex you should be able to pay duty as well. This simply meana businesses importing goods have to start charging forex pakutengesa otherwise unonyura

2436 2018-11-23 06:55:24 This makes sense. Plus 80-110% duty is just too much! Why not reduce the % duty 

If one earn Bond $$$ or RTGs, and there is no RBZ forex no Parallel/ Black market, it's illegal, then what is one supposed to do to buy even the smallest basic import ??

2508 2018-11-23 06:03:24 No, if you can afford to ruse forex to py for an import then you may as well pay its duty in forex. you cannot demand USD only payment for products that you are getting from local suppliers and paying them in RTGS like what pharmacies are doing.
2509 2018-11-23 06:02:41 Why demand duty in forex if its 1:1
2510 2018-11-23 06:00:03 Whats the idea in charging duty in forex???
2511 2018-11-23 06:00:03 Of course there is a shortage which needs to be addressed one way or the other. One gvt needs to raise revenue in forex and also limit imports especially on non-essentials. That reduces pressure on the RBZ and the miners who are subsidising everyone.

2513 2018-11-23 05:59:13 Any way if you have you FCA you simply withdrew, however the grand plan is to reduce the imports of vehicles , that may increase forex supply which seen exchanged on black market its jailable, #ngazviende mberi,

2526 2018-11-23 05:51:59 So civil servants and all those who are paid in Bond and RTGS will never own motor vehicles? If they look for forex on the black market to pay duty, the government will slap them with 10years imprisonment... Poor people will remain poor
2527 2018-11-23 05:51:49 The Forex & Crypto markets can offer outstanding returns for minimal investment
Start your account from just US$100. Leave it grow until you have enough to draw down monthly. 10% per month returns
2528 2018-11-23 05:51:26 They are equivalent but usd can be used externally while the bond can  not. So if you buy internal stuff use bond. Imports use forex. Simple
2529 2018-11-23 05:51:09 Zimbabweans might make you think they are victims.
1 a business charges in forex but cries when asked to pay taxes in forex, they want to use rtgs and bond notes this are refusing to accept from customers
2530 2018-11-23 05:50:53 It was bound to rain, are u not aware of the heatwave. Heaven is not smiling it's crying on our behalf. A country that demands $US and Bond are equal by ginya and wants forex for duty. Haizi corruption hre, yozoti maroad fines up to $700 which grade of weed is circulating
2531 2018-11-23 05:50:35 Minister rocks up in a brand new taxpayer-funded Toyota V8 and tells a teacher or nurse who saved the little they could to buy themselves a humble car from Japan that when their vehicle gets off the ship, they will pay duty in forex - not even a grace period. The cruelty of it!
2532 2018-11-23 05:50:24 We will have to pay duty on caviar in forex,  sigh.

2535 2018-11-23 05:47:44 So basically in Zimbabwe we can be jailed for 10 years for importing anything from a car to a box of matches.
Duty to be paid in forex yet the banks don't have forex and buying forex on the blackmarket gets you 10years in prison.....ma funnies chaiwo!
2536 2018-11-23 05:46:34 Since we now have separate RTGS FCA & RTGS FCA Nostro , I anticipate the banks to start offering loan facilities to RTGs FCA Nostro account holders in forex. That would be helpful
2537 2018-11-23 05:46:32 I think sometimes its good to comment when you are informed. Let's not just cry for the US dollar as if we produce US dollars here in Zim. If people have the forex to buy motor vehicles outside why can they not have the forex to pay duty on the same vehicles?

2583 2018-11-23 05:20:56 They say the US & Bond are gedye , gedye . Yet you prescribe a payment currency. Address the root causes. Open Willowvale industries and manufacture cheaper vehicles for all citizens including the cabinet  and parliament who waste lots of forex on imported luxury vehicles
2584 2018-11-23 05:20:17 What is shared nhai boss. The.poor struggle on their own, no forex to pay duty for their vehicles and no vehicle plants in Zim to make local purchases. A car which ceased to be a luxury a long time ago has now become one.
2585 2018-11-23 05:19:30 Your personal car is very productive and essential part of your life. Let's stop this issue of taking a car ad a luxury. The luxury cars for MPs and Ministers don't pay in forex. They should say instead any car above us$20k pays in forex then I agree.
2586 2018-11-23 05:19:22 "Perfumes and toilet waters"
That is cruel. This is an attack to basic humanity. It impinges on personal and household hygiene. They themselves hire private jets and unnecessarily fly out on heavy forex allowances and buy luxurious goods and exempt from tax and duty.
2587 2018-11-23 05:19:15 And you want to give the forex to Bfoward Japan instead of your country.
2588 2018-11-23 05:19:10 Where did you get the forex to import the vehicle? 

I think the same place you got forex to import the vehicle should be the same place you get forex for duty is it not? 

If you can’t then you have no business buying a car. You can’t afford it. 

Adjust your life accordingly.
2589 2018-11-23 05:17:45 And our only source of forex is those illegal money changers and sadly they are arresting them hameno vakuda kuti tiwanepi forex yacho
2590 2018-11-23 05:16:56 If one has forex to import a vehicle in USD surely they have forex to pay duty.

2599 2018-11-23 05:11:35 I think the gvt position on forex is that it shud b legal to adopt 3 tier pricing bcz they have done just that. That's the only way to get the forex to pay the duty, no?
2600 2018-11-23 05:10:47 Fatal ommision in my view. For instance, we need to know what happened to the much published list of companies & individuals who externalised forex. Was the money returned or not? One prays it just wasnt political grandstanding.

2602 2018-11-23 05:10:39 i understand but i thought that meant its a way to divert forex "Honourable Members will be aware that Government has,

to productive industries."
2603 2018-11-23 05:10:30 How many of us are about to import cars??? Why then are we worried about duty in FOREX? Why are we taking panadol for other people’s headaches...
2604 2018-11-23 05:10:25 @MthuliNcube Now that u want your duty for vehicles in forex,can u at least reduce it to around 30-40% right now its as good as 100%
2605 2018-11-23 05:10:19 The only consolation is that even those supporters of Zpf will pay duty in forex for their cars and also pay traffic fines of 700..

Where would one have found forex to buy that car?
Most civil servants want to be paid in forex but are complaining, do they think forex is miracle money?
Government has to earn forex for it to have it
2629 2018-11-23 04:56:53 The budget presented by Mthuli is inconflict and self defeating. Mthuli maintains that 1US$ is equivalent to 1Bond note. He then goes on to say anyone importing a car must pay duty in forex. This is clearly evil and in conflict with the narrative that bond note is equal to US$.
2630 2018-11-23 04:55:09 Same place you get the forex to buy a foreign vehicle
2631 2018-11-23 04:55:00 So if your salary is in RTGS where did you get the US$? It means you're ready to risk jail by buying US$ on black market so to discourage you gvt makes you pay in forex all the way so you risk arrest twice instead of promoting your dabbling information illegality

2645 2018-11-23 04:45:02 My question remains the same why penalise people who are using FREE FUNDS to import their own cars? There should be a difference there duty wise cos that forex did not originate from RBZ.
2646 2018-11-23 04:44:12 He can’t do much just yet me thinks. You need forex to what we all know he would like to do. Let him tackle the arrears through the multilateral financial institutions and the Paris Club and then I remain confident that @MthuliNcube will enter history by floating a Zim EuroBond
2647 2018-11-23 04:43:52 The people who are asking tax payers to pay duty in forex are driving brand new cars payed for by the taxpayer and they do not pay any duty, not even in bond notes.  They want to raise money to charter private jets
2648 2018-11-23 04:43:05 When citizens are told to pay duties in forex when they are paid in bonds, in actual fact the gvt is saying to citizens go and look for forex to give the gvt.

2651 2018-11-23 04:41:39 Inflation is going to escalate out of control and feed the parallel market like never before. What was his thinking.. oh yeah I forgot.. to mop up every single bit of forex for themselves again.
2652 2018-11-23 04:41:30 How do you direct someone's money  to so called production what if one decides to  keep that forex under the pillow now that you have set those condition?
2653 2018-11-23 04:41:19 Tobacco is exported. The exports could be handled directly. There is a middleman, who brings forex. The farmers are paid in bond notes through a transfer into their accounts. This has all the characteristics of a Ponzi scheme. Farmers lose all the time. Same fate met cereals
2654 2018-11-23 04:40:59 go long on major pairs in forex when they drop below usual rates. ex eurusd 1.13 to 1.15. buy when eurusd hits below 1.13

2655 2018-11-23 04:40:24 Like what Jesus said, 'the one who haven't sinned must throw the first stone.' To all those crying about paying duty in forex who know that that they haven't sold US$ using a rate which is not 1:1 can honestly come forward and complain.

2657 2018-11-23 04:39:25 The benefits of forex, namely reduced liquidity risk, 24-hour trading and facility to trade in rising and falling markets makes forex one of the most lucrative markets for MSMEs.

2658 2018-11-23 04:39:18 Exactly. I remember Guvamatanga telling teachers et al that they can't insist on pmt in forex because they don't generate any. Guys, not everyone is meant to in an economy. Povo can not afford the required usd for many critical things and they have no access to it either

2669 2018-11-23 04:34:39 Sir I just feel pity for poor tobacco farmers who imported these cars from Japan. They were given RTGS while the Gvt retained their forex claiming the two are 1:1. Now the same Gvt got very very short memory, if @ all. What is the procedure of challenging this in courts?
2670 2018-11-23 04:33:24 Cluessless gvt instead of serving its people its actually milking them. Hw cn they charge forex  duty on motor vehicles when they ddnt contribute anything to the acquiring of tht forex. *Its like kutenga nyama nemari yemwana yaanenge anhonga*

2672 2018-11-23 04:32:35 How are you defining "forex" in a country operating a multi currency system?

According to the president @edmnangagwa our bank balances are guaranteed at 1:1, its plain criminal to demand otherwise or maybe someone needs to redefine our so called bank balances

Sebelum menentukan posisi trading hari ini, mari simak beberapa faktor penggerak pasar forex & gold hari ini (Jumat, 23 November 2018).
2706 2018-11-23 03:55:50 You want the gvt to accept what you don't accept on the parallel market?!  Let them charge duty on vehicles in forex. You guys have also been terrorising the poor.
2707 2018-11-23 03:51:27 #EURUSD +12 pips moving most of the risk majors to #USD in quieter Asian session trade. 
#GOLD 1.37 higher - #ASX200 has bounced back +29 pts. 
#trading #forex
2708 2018-11-23 03:50:25 Logically the idea is to curtail imports and restrict them to those earning forex or with legitimate forex allocations. I can see the political points you're scoring or at least trying to score but in a market with no forex, it's logical
2709 2018-11-23 03:50:16 #Forex Exchange Rate: $USD equals 112.949 $JPY.
2710 2018-11-23 03:49:43 You sound more into cheerleading - he failed to deal with the three tier currency challenges, imposing duty in Forex on certain commodities yet the bond is a legal tender t 1:1 with USD, and there was nothing new in that #BudgetZW. What did you like the most in that budget?

2713 2018-11-23 03:46:15 When rumour started a month ago abt duty in forex  sm guy from Hre bought 100 cars in Musina
2714 2018-11-23 03:45:00 We getting paid in RTGS/Bond and now pay duty with forex how is feasible/progressive for my small business
2715 2018-11-23 03:44:15 We have a law which says bond and USD are equal,then we have another one which says duty on imported vehicles to be paid in forex??then we have another law which says 10years in jail for changing your bond to USD..this is absolutely nonsense Prof
2716 2018-11-23 03:43:35 US$700 for a road traffic offence in Zim, duty in forex #AusterityForProsperity #ZwBudget
2717 2018-11-23 03:42:58 Govt expenditure must come down, agri sectors need subsidy to reduce forex pressure on food imports. The bond remains a thorn in the preverbal its equal to $ but no one wants it not even the ones dishing it out revenue collection must be increased. Investor luring with relief
2718 2018-11-23 03:41:11 Yes everyone should pay tax..no free supper...we must b productive so duty free raw materials is a positive...allows for job creation and import substitution...plenty opportunities for entreprenuers...jus look at the list of goods tht need duty to be paid in forex
2719 2018-11-23 03:40:34 Basically they just do not want those unnecessary expenses for now to save forex but if you want to then use the balance of what you imported with period
2720 2018-11-23 03:40:28 Let it be immediate we cannot be a car importing country or a buy/ sell country we need production. We already have $5 billion in cars parked in garages around the country. We need public transport and a good railway system. Those that import let them pay in forex
2721 2018-11-23 03:40:27 2 We need to produce not buying and selling we have productive land / industries let’s use technology to create jobs like Kenya not just selling either forex, fons, tomatoes or drugs, go to Xinex mall that is all they do. Done of those guys cannot even remember what they studied
2722 2018-11-23 03:40:27 I think as Zimbos we must stop this consumptive behavior where right now garages a full of cars. Let them pay in forex.If we a to calculate the forex in these car sales on average $5k per we a talking of $5 billion what can we do with that money. We cannot live on selling alone

2763 2018-11-23 02:53:37 I think Mangudya created such a complex spiderweb to unravel & mess on further inspection. As such his budget is more defensive than growth led.
