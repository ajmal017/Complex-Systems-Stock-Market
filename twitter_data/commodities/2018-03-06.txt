41 2018-03-06 21:49:32 $DXY dropped in five down in A here meaning that it may bounce up hard in B up. That would push down all the commodities, including $GC $SI, $CL and $NG

45 2018-03-06 21:22:15 It's kind of what you see with s&p and ftse moving together since they're mostly multinationals - except bitcoins are more like commodities/currencies but not differentiated by use or geographic/national constraints.
46 2018-03-06 21:21:47 It’s not exaggeration, it’s militant atheist behaviour influencing society to become more money orientated & less compassionate, turning human beings into commodities.
47 2018-03-06 21:20:52 No one can really focus on a country that made 440 billion in oil commodities between 50-100 years and still has nothing to show for.
48 2018-03-06 21:14:16 The same party who nominated Hillary Clinton who touted Gramm-Leach-Billy, Commodities Futures modernization act, telecommunications act of 96, NAFTA, CTPA, TPP, TiSA and the  welfare reform bill.
49 2018-03-06 21:10:20 I could say prevent disasters like fires etc. but that doesn’t scale. 
You’d need some power multiplier.
Maybe a smell based stock ticker or any other real-time data ofactification device eg commodities, currency, breaking news, traffic etc.
50 2018-03-06 21:09:15 cuz it seems to me that the worship of commodities and greed is far more satanic than fighting for each human beings right to enjoy the products of their own labor
51 2018-03-06 21:02:19 Not surprised.  Icahn and other Trump promoter Jon Paulsen made bad investments -- commodities etc after the recession and I think they recruited Trump as a vehicle to make their money back.  Icahn was talking up Trump a couple yrs before the election

53 2018-03-06 20:58:15 2 doa who thnk we are wailers,tell me 1 dff btw the state of the Nation during APC government & b4,during,and after the so called recession we experienced? D answer you get is nothing but abject poverty,scarcity,increase in prices of commodities and untold hardship among others.
54 2018-03-06 20:56:44 There is a world commodities market, you cannot just up your price because you’re the second largest producer. What is happening to oil is different because there’s a cartel involved and they manipulate supply to get the price they want.
55 2018-03-06 20:55:00 Not sure why that should be true in all circs (true commodities like energy categories benefit) but I generally agree. Central teams just aren’t close enough to the users and one size cannot fit all.
56 2018-03-06 20:47:32 I think a lot of that is just posturing, can’t disregard a trade war completely and look like an idiot. Cash and commodities are always safe but the US Government Aint gonna let our manufacturing sector fail
57 2018-03-06 20:31:22 TIPs market is pricing in greater inflation. Raw commodities, led by $WEAT, $USO, $NIB, $GLD paving the way for painful inflation readings. The deflationary powers of cheap imports will be negated by Trump tariffs.

62 2018-03-06 19:55:17 I just don’t value day 3 prospects when compared to known commodities. Moreover, Bennett provides both production and leadership to Beasley, Takk, and Jarrett. We’ve had recent success with late draft picks, but historically that just isn’t the case.
63 2018-03-06 19:53:34 Unless you're a 20 something with a 40 to 50 year time horizon there is no good reason for you to be in the stock market. Build a diversified asset allocation model of dividend producing blue chips, EM debt, short-term Treasuries, and the Deutschebank commodities index

80 2018-03-06 18:23:40 OK, let's see what Germany does when we put a 25% duty on Audi, MB, and BMW.  I don't think they want to go down that rabbit hole.  The U.S. duties on basic commodities (steel and aluminum) is correct and will enhance war making ability.

237 2018-03-06 05:55:57 I've read maybe one intelligent comment about tariffs. The purpose is to protect strategic industries (aerospace, metals, pharma, oil, weapons, scarce commodities, communications etc) that we can't live w/o in the event of an interruption (screwing enemies is just a perk)  $$=War
238 2018-03-06 05:54:48 Indian MLAs should be listed as tradable commodities on NSE and BSE. Don't you think?
239 2018-03-06 05:53:51 “#Malaysia does not want a trade war with Europe but if one is foisted on us, we will respond with might and tact,” Plantation Industries and Commodities Minister Mah Siew Keong said at an industry conference. #KualaLumpur #news #trade

247 2018-03-06 04:47:26 Mira con no robar y desaprovechar la mejor década que tuvimos con los commodities como hicieron los K, ya hizo muchísimo por la gente, el problema de los argentinos es que tenemos memoria corta y exigimos que todo se arregle en un día, así es muy difícil.
248 2018-03-06 04:33:50 Should I add walrus penal bone to my commodities futures?
249 2018-03-06 04:20:42 Should Indian MLAs be listed as tradable commodities on NSE and BSE ?
250 2018-03-06 04:20:07 @NancyCNBC Goodmorning it is interesting to me all of sudden the focus of market shifted from stocks earning to commodities , steel , aluminium, oil etc! it shows how news dynamic is and so volatility!
251 2018-03-06 04:17:40 I doubt any of us who believe this is abusive are "phobic" of homosexuals. That's just absurd. I don't fear anyone, but I do call BS on using children as commodities. Children deserve a mother and a father. What is so difficult to understand about that?
252 2018-03-06 04:13:06 Boring and flat day in the market, positions are holding steady. 
So again it appears to be consolodating. Currencies flat, commodities generally flat, stocks flat. DXY losing a little ground under 90 again. My excitement in volitility may have been premature. Shares up a little.
253 2018-03-06 04:06:30 And tell those idiots that China dumping low priced commodities and goods is the best thing that could happen to Americans. It offsets the parasitic inflationary currency policy of our rat bastard leaders.
254 2018-03-06 03:58:33 Forced to do it... all commodities rates are higher .. salary's are not increased.. this bound to happen... She is waiting for Achee Din!! Which will never come.. very sad..
255 2018-03-06 03:57:06 Why only ULIP vs MF? Why not FDs, Commodities? Why not same treatment for equity and debt funds? Why do we crib only when it hurts us?
256 2018-03-06 03:50:32 Trump did not specify China...he targeted the commodities of steel and aluminum.
257 2018-03-06 03:44:07 The US has been swamped with low quality Chinese steel, while our factories, workers and safety have been compromised.  Steel & Aluminum are commodities of state security. And China has high tariffs against US products, including steel. #MAGA
258 2018-03-06 03:14:59 Why we still treating women like commodities.
259 2018-03-06 03:06:06 Also, I guess *if* a coin is structured 100% in the manner of an OTC commodities forward, then the coin can't be traded on unregistered derivatives exchanges.
260 2018-03-06 03:03:29 With the BRICS Bank, the Bitcoin, you most be feeling mediocre, you can take advantage of poor under develop countries, they don't know, it will take a long  time get the money back. but you can like always take their commodities. you are corrupted greedy and did I say mediocre.
261 2018-03-06 02:58:20 @AzmiShabana One time I agree with u. Have been shouting from the roof since ages to stop portraying women as commodities but women themselves want to b portrayed as items !! Why ? People whistling on such songs are called indecent!! Why? Is this FoE & FoS??
262 2018-03-06 02:54:02 I don't know. You thought about commodities? When stocks are up, commodities like gold and silver go down. It's all about diversification. 

No to Sufjan. Late-period Fiona Apple.
263 2018-03-06 02:52:55 I thought he represents the pain from the gnawing alienation wage work leaves us with and our futile attempts to fill this hole with commodities. Or hunger.
264 2018-03-06 02:50:07 The war on drugs is a decrepit facade, the capitalist state wants you to get high on commodities.
265 2018-03-06 02:48:41 Companies that drive the trends are often the unicorns but the repeatable billion dollar businesses come from delivering access to those trends. Creating products or funds to "bet on crypto" or "bet on the emerging mrkt commodities" 

i.e. bet on other ppl betting on crypto
266 2018-03-06 02:42:08 Empower yourself by being stronger than the capitalist urge to consume addictive commodities.
267 2018-03-06 02:38:02 Agreed. Rare Earths listed as one of 35 commodities critical to US National Security - $ARU also worth a watch, RE: Approval. Political and Economic play.
268 2018-03-06 02:37:29 That's one of the thorniest issues in this space. A lot of the coins are promoted as if they're 1920s-era securities, but have no real value. So the seller can (try to) claim they're just commodities.
269 2018-03-06 02:33:14 You did an amazing job: you were clear thinking, calm, focused, truthful but fair and kind.  Pretty rare commodities these days. Hat's off to you, Sir.

277 2018-03-06 02:06:20 China has high tariffs & poor quality goods and commodities for countries they want to triumph over. These same countries borrow billions if not trillions from them, making them vulnerable for hostile takeovers. Their allies get low tariffs/ goods and commodities.
278 2018-03-06 02:06:20 I think that's right. The "new asset" is the token. This argument is unsettled even though some major law firms have asserted it complies with securities laws. I had not heard anyone call these tokens commodities, yet.
279 2018-03-06 01:57:08 Hence why commodities are the victims of extreme greed and fear moves - classic herd spec vehicles

281 2018-03-06 01:54:09 BiG assumption is earning growth will revert to past mean . No consideration is given to shift in Consumer shifts , global supply chain ( brand vs commodities ) , new royalty rules etc which makes developed countries esp. US to enjoy higher earning growth vs developing countries
282 2018-03-06 01:53:59 Once the price of commodities fall, which they do from time to time. Recessions happen. For China, a recession is malnutrition and starvation. A billion people in poverty is a disaster.
283 2018-03-06 01:52:37 Those are all commodities yes. Plus, beef, corn, ect...but everyone trades those. Including the USA. But only we have a Apple, Google, Microsoft, Walmart, Tesla, GM’s ....ect. That’s where our economic strength comes from.
284 2018-03-06 01:50:01 #BitNautic acts as a marketplace for goods and commodities where  importers, exporters, end-consumer and producers are available to trade  their products and ease their trading practices all over the globe.
285 2018-03-06 01:49:32 What commodities does China export? Soy beans, pork belly's, gold, silver, iron ore, lumber?
286 2018-03-06 01:49:29 yeah. under labor theory of value, the thing's real worth is how much work went into it, but because we fetishize commodities as inherently valuable, the price of the thing and the actual labor value are going to be different.
287 2018-03-06 01:45:07 Didn't cheat on his wife

289 2018-03-06 01:43:55 Tourists from Singapore, China & Indonesia is the biggest contributors to Malaysian tourism. Tourism is the 3rd highest contributor in term of foreign exchange receipts after manufacturing & commodities.
290 2018-03-06 01:42:40 Cars probably part of this but I still think commodities continue to rally for the next year or 2 narrowing the CAD.
291 2018-03-06 01:42:39 There are so many what ifs in energy and commodities that people forget the possible outcomes - shale was one for example
292 2018-03-06 01:41:46 Let me see China exports more commodities then they do consumer products? What planet do you live on?
293 2018-03-06 01:40:47 Almost all walmart jobs are service labor (retail, stocking and maintenance) , not productive labor like the production of commodities like cotton. The "exploitation of surplus labor" equation only makes sense in the context of commodity production. (NOTE: I am not a Marxist)
294 2018-03-06 01:38:29 Our economic strength comes from our innovation and diversity. Not exporting commodities. China is doing the same thing japan did in the 1980’s.
295 2018-03-06 01:36:03 Founding fathers didn’t live in a world economy with income taxes. Plus all they exported was commodities. Different world today
296 2018-03-06 01:33:47 Not because it exports commodities like steel or coal.
297 2018-03-06 01:25:29 Mind my ignorance but what does this mean for securities and commodities?
298 2018-03-06 01:22:34 I’m so happy you people don’t make decisions on trade because you’re unbelievably stupid. Steel and aluminum, (commodities) are integrated in thousands of products. This will increase prices/costs while simultaneously lowering demand. It will make unemployment rise as a result
299 2018-03-06 01:21:58 By way of illustration, NY has a very broad statute called the Martin Act that could be used for purposes of enforcement and covers both securities and commodities.
300 2018-03-06 01:17:01 Beats are like commodities, when you dont have any you miss them
301 2018-03-06 01:15:45 Treat our farmers better by not creating a volatile commodities market.

303 2018-03-06 01:11:58 As the demand decreases, so will the number of animals being bred. Supply and demand are concepts that operate over time. No one except the livestock industry wants them dead. We see animals as sentient beings, not commodities or $$$.

305 2018-03-06 00:54:38 Not to mention that there will have to be exemptions or imports of higher end commodities (tires,strands, and ropes) will be forced as the steel for their domestic production is eliminated.  Volume of the  exemptions eliminates the basis of the argument

312 2018-03-06 00:27:09 But I do not think tariffs are way to do it. Tariffs will only punish the steel and aluminum US commodities and consumers who purchase them.  Please consider an alternative strategy.
313 2018-03-06 00:22:19 ... the point being that ALL commodities are subject to this sort of thing.
314 2018-03-06 00:18:52 Shhhh...... Don't say that too loud.... This hauling commodities keeps the trucks rolling. All depends on who has what bought where. Can haul product 700km 1 way, reload same product nearby and haul it back to almost the same spot
