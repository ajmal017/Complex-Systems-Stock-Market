2) most are staying put for 10+ years

By simply doing nothing, homeowners are in a sense automating their investment. 

Most don’t have the understanding or the temperament to research and own stocks for 10+ years

39 2018-10-17 23:48:00 NOTE:

The ONLY thing that causes the stock market to bounce back is the buying of the fallen stocks at the lower price BECAUSE one thinks it will bounce back

THAT is of limited utility and when IT fails the TRUMP REVERSAL may be rushing past the point of no return

63 2018-10-17 23:22:18 Uber valued at $120B now, but only $76B two months ago. Yeap, Wall Street is so rational.  Investment banks never pump the stocks which they underwrite.
64 2018-10-17 23:22:10 I like how the woman didn't stop the fight when it was 2 v 1....but stopped it when it was one left with 300% and no stocks left.
65 2018-10-17 23:21:19 It's simple. No one benefits more from the infrastructure than the corporations. No one profits more from the corporations than the wealthy who either own, run or own stocks in the corporations. They should pay ALL taxes or furnish retirement and health insurance.
66 2018-10-17 23:20:51 And that is precisely how NOT to invest in stocks
67 2018-10-17 23:19:10 Don't play the penny stocks.

70 2018-10-17 23:15:46 Stocks are "inflation protection". Sure they are. 

1973
Inflation: +8.5%
$SPX return: -17.4%

1974
Inflation: +12.5%
$SPX return: -29.7%

When inflation obliterates your savings and stock market accounts then you will understand why the FED raises rates.

80 2018-10-17 23:09:44 Have read most of them.  My advice: pick one of them, & then study it until you could write it. And make sure that it can actually be applied to making money. For my money, it’s #1. “How to make money in stocks”. I’m still studying it, which is why I have not yet written a book.

83 2018-10-17 23:07:14 Is it because I call tall people “beans stocks” 
84 2018-10-17 23:05:53 Also when I screen stocks after 4pm eastern time I always check post market. One trade I spent 15 mins preparing the trade and then checked post market after. It had gone up 20% on some after market news.

88 2018-10-17 23:04:48 EW works because BMs are positively skewed so EW increases probability of picking high performing stocks. EW with a concentrated portfolio offers the best chance of winning but then you have to know which stocks to concentrate which leads you back to indexing.
89 2018-10-17 23:03:57 I’m surprised Canadian marijuana stocks are legally tradeable in US stock exchanges. I could have easily forseen a Sessions DOJ somehow trying to stop that on the grounds that it’s trading finance for a schedule I narcotic (which it is, even if I support legalization of pot)

94 2018-10-17 23:02:01 Print money, inflate stocks/stock market. Inflate everything by design. Then raise interest rates, crash the economy, then they take everything from the people and gain more control...  #bitcoin is the new economy.

96 2018-10-17 22:59:04 @realDonaldTrump Those who only own stocks, bonds, etc (house and car) can easily put things in a blind trust.  A sole proprietor can do the same.  To ask a real estate magnate to do that seems a bit far fetched.   Income from your various properties are up since you became..

100 2018-10-17 22:57:01 US stocks slid overnight as the corporate earnings season continues. The mixed results from these reports could be partly to blame but the content of the US Fed minutes might be the key element that undermined investor confidence last night @JonoChan_CMC

105 2018-10-17 22:54:18 idk if you're dumb or what, but if the demand was low, you don't need many stocks and when people buy that low demand album, it may seem like it's selling good because of few stocks left but it is not. did you even study economics?

111 2018-10-17 22:50:49 Volatility remains in the market. Last night, the US Fed's September meeting was viewed as hawkish, seeing stocks lower, USD up and 10yr yields to 3.2%. A unanimous decision to raise rates was revealed as well as the sentiment further ones are to come.
112 2018-10-17 22:50:48 But i would argue that if you define market by # of stocks and not value, any deviation from equal-weight is akin to picking stocks

However, I treat stocks the same as crypto. 1% in stocks is also 1% in crypto. So why treat them differently.

121 2018-10-17 22:44:54 Well a crappy reality is that the bubble has to pop. If you invested in those healthcare stocks I feel sorry for you. This was clearly not sustainable. Either way it’s fairly obvious that prices have to plummet

125 2018-10-17 22:43:41 stocks rise by 1%.
126 2018-10-17 22:41:18 That would make sense with the prevailing assumption that “they” like to ramp stocks into opex

128 2018-10-17 22:40:13 I agree. The only change I’m hoping to notice is my stocks to go up 
129 2018-10-17 22:39:52 I admit Tony Abbott had a moment if stupidity by saying he'd shirt front Putin but Tony wasn't a bad PM , Kevin Rudd & Juliar Gillard are the worst Leaders Australia has ever had , both laughing stocks & made Australia a laughing stock on the world stage
130 2018-10-17 22:39:03 All the TV’s in FL are tuned to Faux....unless their stocks decline they will say and do anything to keep him in power...
131 2018-10-17 22:39:00 The three innocent fracking protesters should also be compensated from the pocket of the judge who jailed them.
AND that judge should be put in stocks so we can pelt him with rancid fruit.
132 2018-10-17 22:38:54 Jam-makers and web-designers and hairdressers and butchers and bakers and so on, not big business, not stocks and shares, not doing anything wrong or underhand, just making a living and employing people and paying tax.

134 2018-10-17 22:37:08 When your parent company is 1115.69 dollars per stock but you still decide to push something on production without doing tests and your stocks fall by 5.59 dollars.
135 2018-10-17 22:37:00 I hate when I have to give people the real take on cannabis stocks, everyone always texts me asking about pot stocks thinking I’ll say it’s a homerun. Research!!
136 2018-10-17 22:36:49 My dad because he has multiple financial portfolios and keeps amazing track of all the stocks and other investment options out there
137 2018-10-17 22:36:40 @djvlad haha stocks went suicide u still saying stay away from bitcoin?
138 2018-10-17 22:36:29 I agree. Any suggestions on individual stocks.
139 2018-10-17 22:35:33 magkano kaya stocks ng jype?  ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
140 2018-10-17 22:35:33 why would they do that lol like we know BTS albums are on demand and always get stocks thx for checking for us ig
141 2018-10-17 22:34:55 Buy stocks or Silver/Gold
142 2018-10-17 22:33:22 Correction it does have limit orders for both stocks and options, but does not have stop losses for options. It does have stop loss orders for Stocks
143 2018-10-17 22:32:24 No. 65mm is closer to 12k under ideal conditions. 35mm is 5-6K. But the actual amount of detail captured depends on film stocks, lenses, lighting, and many other factors. Important thing is the QUALITY of pixels captured, not an arbitrary K number.
144 2018-10-17 22:31:24 It does have limit buy orders for Stocks but not for options, It has limit sell orders for options
145 2018-10-17 22:30:08 Haha seriously! You’re right. Nobody really knows what could happen to these stocks
146 2018-10-17 22:29:33 2. Because Robinhood will go ahead to buy high for you. As I ordered to buy while it was too high on 60 minutes chart then dropped 2 dollars that I lose too much, ha. I hope you will learn better to order to buy your stocks while it is nice bottom on 60 minutes chart.
147 2018-10-17 22:29:20 One argument made by indexing zealots is that it's next to impossible  to beat the market routinely by picking winners.  However, sufficient evidence exists to argue that it's not picking the stocks that matters, but how you weight them as components in a portfolio.
148 2018-10-17 22:28:57 With the deluge of US debt being auctioned in coming months, the continued Bull market in stocks seems kind of funny.
149 2018-10-17 22:28:19 I was gonna read the article about which weed stocks to buy then I remembered I don’t have any $$$

151 2018-10-17 22:25:49 Yea, once the companies actually start reporting high earnings their stocks will take off. Some will go bust, but there is definitely money to be made in this market.
152 2018-10-17 22:25:49 Watched the markets with big hopes3 of our stocks were in the GREEN!
153 2018-10-17 22:25:36 HE IS THE MOST STUPDID ASS HATDBNDNDMD no wonder bighit surpassed their stocks ughhhh
154 2018-10-17 22:25:27 Only think that sucks about Canada legalizing cannabis is I can’t buy cannabis stocks on Robinhood.
155 2018-10-17 22:23:52 Stocks are risky business
156 2018-10-17 22:23:50 @karenhunter Just received my BombAss stocks...oh may Lord sooo huggy and soft...love them!
157 2018-10-17 22:23:37 Great.  She needs to vote to ban bump stocks and high capacity magazine assault rifle look a likes that have been instrumental in school shootings and mass assaults.  I have no problem with it.  Why would any  person be for them?

BTW, I know they're not assault rifles.
158 2018-10-17 22:22:56 Which stocks do you invest in
159 2018-10-17 22:22:15 O!  This is serious, but 3D guns are ok,  bump stocks are ok, purchasing a firearm without a mental health background check is okay,  every American having the same health care as congressmen is not okay.  #LostPriorities Stop supporting #Crazytown
160 2018-10-17 22:20:20 You invested in any stocks ?
161 2018-10-17 22:20:06 Cramer warns against buying volatile Canadian pot stocks until things settle down after legalization
162 2018-10-17 22:19:58 No it wouldn't.  It would be less than 21 trillion, more likely 14 trillion due to all those lost BTC.  The US market cap of all stocks is way more than that, more like 40-50 trillion.  And by then, more like 200-300 trillion.
163 2018-10-17 22:19:33 no clue why it was the only winner of the big stocks
164 2018-10-17 22:19:18 Just like to add, this Austrian school experiment failed epically.  As one might expect the wealthy didn't increase their overhead with that cheap cash, instead they bought back their own stocks, creating as massive pump and dump.
165 2018-10-17 22:18:28 i dont know about robotics but many proofs how CEO sold company stocks and earn on it #TRXC
166 2018-10-17 22:17:45 Billionaire investor Leon Cooperman says bonds, not stocks, are in a bubble."The economy, if anything, is too strong," Cooperman says. "The economy is on fire. … The conditions that normally lead to a big decline just aren't present." #3500EDGEAUSTIN
167 2018-10-17 22:17:11 No. This won't be anything like last January. Stocks will be quiet and the same as they are now
168 2018-10-17 22:16:28 Not sure what you're asking. I'm saying look at $YECO, $CADC, and $CCCL today compared to the pot stocks.
169 2018-10-17 22:16:01 my ideal crypto would replace traditional currency. id want it to be able to be used, not just stockpiled like stocks. imagine trying to buy a pizza with shares of a company, and then the processing fee is worth more than 4 pizzas even if they accept it.
170 2018-10-17 22:14:50 @PatForanCTVNews hi! Just curious, how can a person buy stocks?
171 2018-10-17 22:14:48 @NBCNews @HarvardBiz Leon's bubble sends the stocks down, business investment down, jobs creation down, and long term expansion down, as well as create an unstable economy in the DOD. The best plan is to invest long term with a few companies you have passions for. And pay taxes.

173 2018-10-17 22:14:13 Why ban bump stocks?
174 2018-10-17 22:13:54 Ha, thanks. My parents have someone do their taxes for them, so I usually use her. My HR is useless and I don't think they do stocks advice, but something I can look into. The last one is mostly anxiety, so that's all me. :P
175 2018-10-17 22:13:02 There are at least 43 stocks with a combined market value of $36 billion on two major Canadian exchanges — five years ago, there were none..
176 2018-10-17 22:12:35 Your in a saturated industry... Your bad decision making isn't the countries fault its your fault for not moving with the times.  Your forcing your stocks to work well that won't happen now make better decisions.
177 2018-10-17 22:12:27 @DSjuggerud I have been a true wealth member for 2 years and invested in your stock recommendations.  Like you recommended I put all my cash to work expecting great returns on your China stocks. Lost money with the stops especially tencent and China internet.  Future better?
178 2018-10-17 22:11:31 No you've got it wrong. He's claiming active managers bought illiquid stocks that have been battered and causing sub par performance. He clearly states that alpha is over and asks how long will investors wait on the basis not of two years but a month long sell off. Perhaps read
179 2018-10-17 22:11:22 Yo digo que hay que darle par de semanas/meses porque como dije yo creo que los stocks estaban ya sobrevaloradas para take into account esto mismo. Yo estoy pensando vender canopy que le saque cc ya y aguantar cronos que estoy perdiendo jajajaja
180 2018-10-17 22:11:03 I will never buy Netflix stock. I own VT the Vanguard Total World Market ETF. It has 8000 stocks in it. It must also have Netflix. I think VT a better investment than Netflix! How long Netflix song & dance last? It may not be different from song & dance Trump! How long he lasts?

183 2018-10-17 22:09:30 US Dollar Rallies, Stocks Pullback Ahead of FOMC Minutes
184 2018-10-17 22:09:28 This just in Dorito stocks have skyrocketed !!! LMFAO!!
 #TopicalHumor #firstpersontomakethisjoke
185 2018-10-17 22:09:03 Market Close:  MBS -27bps; DOW -91.74; NASDAQ -2.79; S&P 500 -0.71; 10yr Treasury 3.21%; Stocks Close in red, but off of earlier lows; MBS tanks after FOMC Minutes released, while Yields jump up 5bps (from 3.16% to 3.21%), raising more concerns to investors.
186 2018-10-17 22:08:01 Yeah. We have a World Market here and a private liquor store that stocks beers from around the world. I'm fortunate in that regard. I don't drink much these days, but that's because it stopped agreeing with me once I turned 32
187 2018-10-17 22:07:39 @jimcramer thank you for all the help picking stocks that make us money . You taught me a ton on how to do homework and make smart choices . Starting investing only 2 years ago because I had to raise 3 kids & didn’t have extra $. So glad I watch everyday ! TY
188 2018-10-17 22:07:26 Probably because this isn’t important or newsworthy to the more than half of Americans own no stocks. Out of touch much?
189 2018-10-17 22:05:40 But they did when stocks fell last week. Why didn't you mention that?
190 2018-10-17 22:04:57 **needs to buy EDC Orlando tickets so @spunbob808 doesn’t tackle me**

**invests more money into stocks**
191 2018-10-17 22:04:13 Great news? After stocks plummeted over a cliff last week this is an improvement? #WeDontBelieveYou. Everything you say is an outright lie or some attempt to spin the Truth.
192 2018-10-17 22:03:42 Toujours je repousse pour acheter des fringues au final ils sont en rupture de stocks
193 2018-10-17 22:03:37 After hours Chinese stocks are up:  $CADC 73%, $YECO 56%, and $CCCL 34%
194 2018-10-17 22:03:22 U.S. stocks lower at close of trade; Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.36%. Canada stocks lower at close of trade; S&P/TSX Composite down 0.56%
195 2018-10-17 22:02:21 Yeah & where are all the dead stags heads...I bet you don’t even have to walk that far to go to the toilet?! Not happening #fallenbanjossticktogether
196 2018-10-17 22:02:07 Since when does he attack the weed biz ? He had Canopy On at least 2/3 times , among other like constellation brands , maybe you should pick stocks and give us your track record ! He help everyday people make better choices and teaches it in a fun way .

205 2018-10-17 21:57:07 You can make $$$ on mj stocks if you pay attention and but smartly. Do the research. Read the financials#becareful
206 2018-10-17 21:56:31 My two pot stocks, CANN down 10% and TNY down 9% today and both were down a similar amount yesterday. Not a pleasant couple of days for sure! Better days to come hopefully :)
207 2018-10-17 21:53:09 its logical, yet some people still don't understand that
I worked in a shop and the best sellers products were what composed 80% of our stocks because we know clients ask for it a lot.
208 2018-10-17 21:52:43 Nope, I generally agree with his policies, but his stance on bump stocks and lack of due process when it comes to gun owners' rights disgust me.
209 2018-10-17 21:52:28 I feel like the pump would last longer if it was done that way? In stocks P&D can last several hours. It rips 50% in like 1 second and retraces instantly.
210 2018-10-17 21:51:34 Sorry to hear this Emma, we increased stocks for our BOGOF offer today across our stores and cabinets, but as you can imagine, we never know how many people are going to visit us for sure. Apologies for the inconvenience and hope you get to enjoy a treat before 31st Oct 
211 2018-10-17 21:51:30 I almost want to see this just out of curiosity. Like to they just unironically day “stocks and bonds” and laugh?
212 2018-10-17 21:50:56 Why do they embarrass themselves like this when they'll deadass be lucky if the store even stocks their faves albums

220 2018-10-17 21:46:07 Buy the rumour sell the news? Now it seems cannabis stocks are all around the place....even my classifier has asked me about this.
221 2018-10-17 21:45:08 I think it is telling one has to go back to the early 1990’s to make a point. In case you haven’t kept up, it is 2018. Trump dissolved all his business interest in SA. The Saudi King from that era is now dead. If you have a 401k, I’m sure there are Saudi stocks in there.
222 2018-10-17 21:44:59 #LegalizationInCanada The three primary reasons to invest in cannabis stocks before they're oversold:

1) Dude,

2) weed

3) lmao
223 2018-10-17 21:44:51 The stock market still out performs other investments long-term. If I were in my 20s, I'd have 100% in stocks until I was 45. Then 75% until 50-55 or 5-6 years before I retired. Then I'd go 50% like I have now.  The other in bonds.
224 2018-10-17 21:43:41 I don't blame them either. Provides opportunities for others to sell into . That's the risk with stocks that continue to rise on momentum not fundamentals.
225 2018-10-17 21:43:22 Yup my stocks should be on the rise now 
226 2018-10-17 21:41:58 The management shift announced after hours in $STZ is going to be a huge positive there. Rob Sands, in his role as Executive Chairman at Constellation plans to oversee the $4B $CGC Canopy Growth investment directly. Should give both stocks a boost IMO.
227 2018-10-17 21:41:52 People, in general, are not.  But never underestimate the stupidity of the #MAGATS that believe (and I kid you not) the deficit has nothing to do with them; that their 401(k) is doing well, and that because the market crashes, since they don't own stocks, they will be OK!

233 2018-10-17 21:39:19 It doesn't make much sense to me either. It's just getting hammered along with all Chinese Internet stocks, which have all fallen out of favor for the time being.

245 2018-10-17 21:31:04 What policies has the #GOPCrimeSyndicate instituted that have led to jobs? The only thing happening in reality is a cocaine boost to the stock markets as corporations buy back records amount of stocks to inflate their prices and redistribute money upward to the 1%.
246 2018-10-17 21:28:55 low float China names often run as a group.  Now saying that, others are not likely to do 700% like YECO did, but traders always look for sympathy plays.  Kind of like solar names ran all at once back in their days, or weed stocks are doing, shippers..  etc

261 2018-10-17 21:19:22 Nebraska's politics and general lack of progressive policies (as big as no legal weed, as local as Fremont passing some of the most hateful anti-immigration laws in the nation plus the laughing stocks that are Sasse, Ricketts, Fischer) are the biggest deterrents.

264 2018-10-17 21:17:21 I think u can say that about most stocks now Guys. We already have a RSI extreme as the warning sign, now all we need is a MACD monthly rolling over the signal line that will likely be the end of this bull. For now, just a yellow flag party on!
265 2018-10-17 21:17:14 WHAT A RIDE!!!!!!!
266 2018-10-17 21:15:09 Doing my research on it now. I hear tomorrow could be a HUGE day for Bio rather than pot stocks.
267 2018-10-17 21:14:57 @DrewOnTheRadio Just catching the show, by weed investment are you talking stocks? Waiting for one company to take off now that Canada has opened up to help boost my 401k.
268 2018-10-17 21:13:37 @RiskReversal @petenajarian @timseymour @GuyAdami Not bashing just the facts. Dan Nathan has been bearish most of this run for 10 years. I’m sure he’s made money too but wow the guy is a half empty dude no matter if stocks cheap or expensive!

276 2018-10-17 21:08:12 to be honest, I don't even want to try to attempt to game the crypto trade. I have my own personal opinion on the whole thing, hence why I stick to what I know: stocks and options. IMHO, if/when central banks start their own crypto, Bitcoin et al go to 0 right quick
277 2018-10-17 21:07:12 2 weeks and im obessed with stocks thanks to all the Arab guys in my class  my friend made $450 off cannabis stock today

280 2018-10-17 21:04:17 The Boeing Company (BA) price at close, 2018-10-17, is 365.5. #boeing #stocks #NYSE #space

284 2018-10-17 21:02:34 Again, millions of middle class taxpayers have 401k plans or pensions invested in corporate stocks that will benefit long term too. And it is not likely Congress will allow the rate cuts to expire anyway.
285 2018-10-17 21:02:04 95% of my profits comes from stocks with 4 or 5 letters in its symbol. Only 5% comes in stocks with 3 letters or less. Goes to show my preference for micro and small caps. I love OTC and Nasdaq small "crap" stocks. I hate NYSE big cap names
286 2018-10-17 21:01:55 Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) price at close, 2018-10-17, is 271.4531. #teslamotors #tesla #stocks #NASDAQ #elonmusk
287 2018-10-17 21:01:53 That means the extra ¥ for the 2nd & 3rd stocks would also add to the income track as well, correct?

290 2018-10-17 21:01:12 Stocks erase most of early losses after huge gain; IBM sinks
291 2018-10-17 21:00:46 Come election time Soros backed corporations will intentionally dump stocks manipulate the market to hurt Republicans and conservatives. Dems & socialists are going to try and hurt the economy through the markets in order to gain power power back.  This will happen!
292 2018-10-17 21:00:14 In the equation where people get paid less, robots take jobs, and corporations and investors profit—a necessary inversion will allow individuals to capture direct value previously siphoned by corporations; stocks will tank but prosperity will thrive in a way we’ve never measured.

294 2018-10-17 20:59:44 Oh for sure. Unless somebody was issuing these orders to manipulate stocks in media companies, there's very little here that's criminal. But I'm speaking about how this looks as somebody going into the field and picking their way through the wreckage.

300 2018-10-17 20:54:41 Breathtaking. Real economy stocks in free fall left and right, but the Fed will be shocked when they hike us into next recession. Warnings everywhere
301 2018-10-17 20:53:55 Thanks. Just be careful, only play with money you can afford to lose. I don't day trade. Used to in the dot com days and when everything went bad (it always does) a lot of people lost a lot of money they couldnt afford to. I got lucky roll your profits so you are using free money
302 2018-10-17 20:52:58 Yo Phil hope you enjoying your vacation bro, meanwhile back here in Canada pot going crazy, pot stocks are rolling like crypto was at Christmas last year, any chance you want in on some of those?
303 2018-10-17 20:52:24 Marijuana stocks were so uneventful today despite the legalization. This gives us a good sense of what to expect in the future of this industry. It is overhyped and overvalued, IMO. The industry won't disappear, but I'm doubtful it'll sky rocket to the moon. $tsx #Marijuanastocks

305 2018-10-17 20:49:58 @jack did say that Twitter was the "Public Square". What's a Public Square without stocks. Next will be Salem Witch Trials and burning people at the electronic stake to see if they are a conservative.
306 2018-10-17 20:49:52 Maybe someday she’ll meet that special someone and not have to bump stocks alone.
307 2018-10-17 20:49:07 well I try to listen to as many opinions. So I do entertain some of their ideas. 

My biggest gripe is just the blanket desire to keep fees as low as possible. I would like to think I am open minded enough to not have a single reason for picking stocks.
308 2018-10-17 20:48:59 What bad news?

Unemployment? 
Stocks?
USMCA?
Smashed ISIS?
GDP?
309 2018-10-17 20:48:38 Trump criticizes Fed raising interest rates too quickly, but he isn't concerned about millions of Americans that don't invest in stocks. The interest rate should go back to 5%.  It was 6% when Reagan was President,  Senior Citizens would benefit with an interest increase.
310 2018-10-17 20:48:36 Yesterday smokes advise about hot stocks ?
311 2018-10-17 20:47:52 And yess I think politics is playing a huge roll and not in the best interest of the stocks either.
312 2018-10-17 20:47:14 Adjust the GDP deflator to account for under reported inflation. Then adjust stock valuations for normalized interest rates. You come up with overvalued stocks and a stagnant debt saturated economy that cannot sustain higher interest rates.
313 2018-10-17 20:46:59 The top five stocks that closed lower today were $IBM, $AZO, $CPB, $AAP, and $NTRS.
314 2018-10-17 20:46:39 Question I asked you earlier however is your calendar different for Canadian versus American MJ stocks?
315 2018-10-17 20:46:13 Yes. Record stocks, Record low unemployment for women and minorities, Fair trade deals that benefit Americans seems out of control. Especially when Barack Hussain Obama said none of it was possible and we need to get used to it. #magicwand
316 2018-10-17 20:46:04 The top five stocks that closed higher today were $UAL, $NFLX, $USB, $GS, and $MS.

323 2018-10-17 20:41:16 so: in a group of expensive stocks (most expensive 20 or 25%) does the shareholder yield factor show a return spread?
324 2018-10-17 20:40:46 Doing sketch cards got me back to collecting, but since retiring from it, it became an alternative to stocks. I think it’s time for a reckoning, sell off everything, and see if I can comeback later on.

Wall Street picks the fairly random winners/losers, not performance
360 2018-10-17 20:17:55 What's worse is the implication that you could be banned from travel for investing in weed stocks.

390 2018-10-17 20:02:53 Except that isn't what happened.  What happened is exactly what everyone outside the GOP bubble said would happen. Companies used the money to buy stocks back inflating the market artificially and creating wealth for the richest among us and bonuses for the CEOS.

393 2018-10-17 20:02:25 Hmmm. Is that why wages are rising, stocks are going up, jobs are being created???? Democrats are terrible!
394 2018-10-17 20:02:16 I hope everyone who is taking profits from Canadian pot stocks are heading to the store to buy legal cannabis  #CanadaLegalization #canadacannabis #cannabis
395 2018-10-17 20:02:11 Thanks to the Fed. trashing the markets this year by jacking up interest rates when the markets should have been very healthy, IRAs/investments performance has been dismal, only a few select stocks doing well. Wall Street picks the fairly random winners/losers, not performance
396 2018-10-17 20:01:30 En tant que militante bien éloignée de la Bretagne, j’ai apprécié cette tribune sans vérifier si son auteur ne buvait pas dans des gobelets en plastique...

405 2018-10-17 19:54:55 I'm pretty sure if anyone ever followed pot stocks today of all days they would follow it. But agree, it will take some time for the news to set in
406 2018-10-17 19:54:10 Tip take the time to READJUST your ALERTS as some stocks might have gone down from this morning HIGH
407 2018-10-17 19:53:30 IF I were ever going to buy $IBM, it would be on a day like today- that said, they've had plenty of time to turn the battleship and the engine that was supposed to power the thrusters needs some tuning up- "cheap" tech stocks don't tend to work too well w/o visible growth path
408 2018-10-17 19:53:24 After taxes ya shit looking crazy. No better time then to own something land, business, stocks.
409 2018-10-17 19:53:09 Just do it....my stocks will appreciate it.....also buy breathalyzer  stocks
410 2018-10-17 19:52:42 Places where stocks gap usually are resistance and support levels. Places where people don't usually buy because the price could jump up or down strongly there. This seems to be riding that line. I think on the top side where it has support rather than resistance.
411 2018-10-17 19:52:13 So short selling is bad because of the Tesla situation? That's quite the argument. 

Stocks often get over bought due to exuberance and smart people should be able to take advantage of that. 

Sure there are downsides, but there's also downsides to overpriced goods in a market.
412 2018-10-17 19:51:34 Good prospects for the #semiconductor industry: @Soitec_EN increases sales by 30% first half of this year. 12" revenue grows 78% after pumping hundreds of thousands of SOI 300 wafers to the market. #FDSOI #stocks #technology
413 2018-10-17 19:50:34 $CGC started breaking out on big volume, then two days of big volume selling.  Might be a warning sign that cannabis stocks aren't ready to breakout yet.  There's still room to correct back down to the 30 week EMA.

423 2018-10-17 19:47:33 Reuters: POLL-US #natgas stocks seen rising 82 bcf in week ended Oct. 12. This compared to 55 bcf build same week last year; 5-year ave of 79 bcf build. This est. build would take stockpiles to 3.038 tcf, lowest for this week since 2003.
424 2018-10-17 19:47:14 And buying Dow stocks aren’t bad, when money is spent that means money is also being earned somewhere else, in that case industrial companies are getting revenue so they can invest more into their company.

427 2018-10-17 19:46:47 No way.. everyone will slowly hear about it days and weeks to follow. You think everyone out there follows pot stocks everyday? Nahh. Aurora is still undervalued right now. USA institutions about to join the party.. and I would bet a lot of them have been waiting for Aurora.
428 2018-10-17 19:46:40 Ummm someone needs to tell the Canadian marijuana stock market that it is #legalizationday and it’s time for those stocks to go UP!  #StockMarket
429 2018-10-17 19:46:04 And stock buybacks aren’t a bad thing either, companies pay their investors a killing to sell their stocks back to them, which means investors make tons, and most times that’s so a company can have majority say in the way things are run so they can expand at quicker rates.
430 2018-10-17 19:45:47 So... Pot stocks it is.

440 2018-10-17 19:41:19 He recently changed the buyback criteria after stocks went up 350% and coincidentally, 
he underperformed the index for 15 years.  

He’s had a really bad 15 years IMO

461 2018-10-17 19:31:15 So, this company is only going to have this one asset (worth $60-90M) and it issued 25M shares for it (at $2)?
So it will have a $250M+ market cap, no debt, assets of $60-90M, and likely a negative cash flow to cover a handful of post-spinoff employees.

532 2018-10-17 18:59:20 bonjour, @La_SQDC 

où trouver les noms des fournisseurs des stocks qui sont proposés sur votre site ?

je veux éviter de donner de l'argent à des gens qui pourraient avoir commis un délit d'initié.

certains membres du parti libéral fédéral, par exemple.

merci !

541 2018-10-17 18:57:28 To reiterate, lithium stocks are down 40%, so it’s fine if we’re down 90% from our highs

543 2018-10-17 18:56:28 No sólo serían los 100mmdp, sería a la larga mantener dos aeropuertos, dos equipos de todo, dos stocks, dos maquinarías, dos Torres. El duplicar cada gasto porque serían satelitales, lejos una de otra en vez de uno solo. , de eso nadie habla.

547 2018-10-17 18:53:02 Busy day but great to finally sit down and see #koov has really made a move today . Hopefully will see some more bounces in stocks that fell last week for no real reason .
548 2018-10-17 18:52:40 The right has a political platform to stand on. Increasing job opportunities, increasing stocks, mutual funds, voting in conservative judges, North Korea negotiations, eliminating NAFTA, etc.The list goes on and on. Unlike the Democrats, their hands are empty
549 2018-10-17 18:52:10 $mmj was one of the first pot stocks I bought. Road it up and got out. Don’t see how it will  survive long term though. I know @stockpigeon is just day trading it and was just poking some fun.
550 2018-10-17 18:51:59 @jungle_2019 @commonking Since you asked, normally, I sell puts on high volatility stocks but I'm passing on this ticker.
551 2018-10-17 18:51:44 Big move higher in the US dollar $UUP today hurting stocks.. No follow through in the market at all after yesterday's big move.
552 2018-10-17 18:50:59 Hi there, thanks for getting back to me. I've had a look and the nearest store that stocks this is the Salford Extra M6 5JG. However, I can't confirm how many will be in stock when you visit the store. 1/2

556 2018-10-17 18:50:20 Thanks Rotimi. The remittances also include investments (real estates, bonds, stocks etc) that they make in Nigeria while abroad. In fact, remittances to Africa as a continent make 6% of Africa’s GDP. It’s a huge contributor.
557 2018-10-17 18:50:11 I remember how much shit I got for saying this while on vacay. Lol. Cult stocks never end up pretty. Ever.
558 2018-10-17 18:49:49 There aren't any "reputable" media anymore? If there are stocks and shares they can't be independent. How come those independent news guys are so wealthy and living well? Does pay that much? If you tell me yes, I'll LITERALLY consider it
559 2018-10-17 18:49:48 Just bought some WEED stocks. Come a long way from buying dime bags in highschool

Man to man. You telling me a guy as smart as you who built your company from scratch and talks stocks and investments, you are saying unequivocally that Kanye was talking about Chattel Slavery and not mental slavery in the TMZ interview? 

Man to man. Tell me
569 2018-10-17 18:47:28 Stocks at anemic 2% growth since #GOPTaxScam passed,
Real wages are down.
Inflation is up.
Interest rates are up and eating away at our income.

But ya, really thrilled about the competitive economy, love seeing real wages fall.
570 2018-10-17 18:47:24 China Doc, what stocks do you like?

574 2018-10-17 18:44:50 I did, I hope I do not do it again, if spot price in the coming years going up to 60-70 I probably sell off a large chunk of my U stocks.
575 2018-10-17 18:44:17 With as many GOP as well as Dem MsofC with literally millions of dollars in their personal bank accounts, stocks, bonds, etc., they don’t need the $140-170k/yr that our taxes pay for their salaries.  #VoteThemOut

578 2018-10-17 18:43:10 I worked at Dr. Jay’s in 2007. Crazy 8’s were $30 in every colorway. When I saw they were going for $180...I was like how? But this sneaker market, Hell fashion market, is so up and down. Somebody should treat fashion likes stocks.

585 2018-10-17 18:41:47 Highest deficit in 6 yrs and largest inflation in 12 yrs!  Wow....on top!  Really?  Ford losing a $billion because of tariffs, Harley moving manufacturing out, real wage growth negative, stocks down 6% last week!  Need more?
586 2018-10-17 18:41:44 You get to hedge on the price by receiving your payment now, and speculators get to gamble and hoard...without affecting stocks I'm shops. In 2 months time you produce 15% more cooking oil.

Could be done for so many commodities.
587 2018-10-17 18:41:34 100 percent agree. I want to hear more about what President Trump’s plan are to control this situation before it even gets here! Not about how the stocks are going up. We are all capable of looking at the stock market. Tell me more about what your plans are about this situation!

590 2018-10-17 18:39:21 What’s going short in stocks @all
591 2018-10-17 18:39:21 You are an idiot.  Stocks go up and down daily.  Look at them now!  They are down.  Overall, no gain for the year.  But that is only one measure of the economy;  most Americans do not even participate.  Did you attend any classes in college or just wast daddy's money sleeping?
592 2018-10-17 18:38:42 Given that the short term fluctuations of the stock market tells us very little about the actual state of the economy for those outside the small percentage that actually own stocks, I am not sure either story is all that important to the average person.

599 2018-10-17 18:35:59 The 2 pot stocks I like right now are $CARA and $CRON.  They are both very different companies, but I like the risk/reward on both, and have highlighted both in the past. CRON is especially attractive heading into earnings on 11/13.
600 2018-10-17 18:35:21 @AklTransport A suggestion for your transport stations/centres: a vending machine that stocks economy umbrellas, hats, beanies, gloves, sunglasses, jandals, ponchos & raincoats, earphones, sunscreen and bike/scooter helmets.

609 2018-10-17 18:32:59 Because she's a f_ing hypocrite. The economy is booming, stocks are up, ties with our friends are strong, trades are strengthening, however the left is crumbling. They are drawing at straws to muster up to be the most pathetic showing at the polls for Democrats.
610 2018-10-17 18:32:44 Hello, you think the stocks will drop?! 
611 2018-10-17 18:32:36 #HimToo  Can we put those girls in the stocks to be pummeled by rotten food or...I don’t know...put on their criminal record “libel, slander, pathological sociopathic liar”?
612 2018-10-17 18:32:03 The gap down, short-squeeze and then reverse pattern is clean. @StocksToTrade
613 2018-10-17 18:31:19 its better than just pumping stocks everytime SPUs are down 2%
614 2018-10-17 18:30:59 Not live because I wanted to record the mega halt resume play, these were all mainly small trades that added up
615 2018-10-17 18:30:42 Weed stocks fixin' for a dirty gap down tomorrow, methinks.
616 2018-10-17 18:30:36 You do know the wealthy basically don't pay taxes. You do know large corporations have effective negative tax rates. You do know that almost all the money large corporations got from the tax breaks went to buying back their own stocks at inflated prices.
617 2018-10-17 18:30:11 The idea is to invest in places where you don’t have to know how much you don’t know to make a decent returns.
The idea is to get enough stocks right so that the ones that didn’t work out can be easily churned out.
And pray to God you live as long as Buffet to make as much as him
618 2018-10-17 18:30:08 sometimes i just don't understand things - $XBI goes up +5%, stocks all bounce and go +XYZ%. ok i understand. next day $XBI drops -1%, stocks give back ALL gains...
619 2018-10-17 18:30:06 He also stocks up on chunky soup so probably not someone who should be taken seriously
620 2018-10-17 18:29:50 I mean it's different if it leads to that but just coming out the gate like "I make 7 figures, no kids, invest in stocks" RELAX.
621 2018-10-17 18:28:44 bad rumors about $FB….
Shit, one of my favorite stocks.

#strictlyvc
622 2018-10-17 18:28:24 Sir do not share Swing trading list. He just tells about the stocks which will blast on that particular day.
623 2018-10-17 18:27:32 This is exactly what was happening with gambling stocks. Smart money was going into long term contracts on weakness and started to creep into short term bets. CZR popping now. Do we see the same pattern with these home builders, thats the question....
624 2018-10-17 18:26:44 You spurred me into gear. Been doing stuff all morning. Taking 20 minute break to check stocks and back to it
625 2018-10-17 18:26:40 And just how many fox and friends viewers actually own stocks?
626 2018-10-17 18:26:10 these books cover the philosophy, methodology, mentality and discipline of trading. If you take the time to understand, study, practice and apply what the authors are saying, their knowledge can be applied to any market: crypto, F/X, stocks, options etc...
627 2018-10-17 18:25:55 US commercial crude stocks are now only 40Mb below last year. With 4-6 weeks more time for seasonal build it is likely that this difference will be closed and we may see inventories above the prior year before winter.
628 2018-10-17 18:25:48 We’ve owned pot stocks since the Constellation deal
629 2018-10-17 18:25:08 403b can be sold off in parts in ways stocks can, but this is at least a small step in the right direction to understand how housing 'assets' really aren't as easy to access as your original claims tried to say.
630 2018-10-17 18:24:37 Holding these China stocks: $HGSH $SEII $DELT for huge moves. We'll see what happens
631 2018-10-17 18:24:17 Someone in my timeline said ,the way stocks behaving in the morning trade doesn't look like bulls gonna handle it well.
632 2018-10-17 18:23:33 Weed stocks aren't going to pump if these fuckers don't have any weed to sell
633 2018-10-17 18:23:20 Manche Übersetzungen sind ja auch gut, bis sie es nicht mehr sind. In dem Roman, den ich gerade aufgeblättert habe, spricht einer stolz davon, dass er im BDSM-Bereich Stöcke aufgestellt hat.

Er meint die englischen "stocks"... das sind Pranger, du Nudel!
634 2018-10-17 18:23:11 Hopefully no one chased any stocks prior to the Fed minutes...
635 2018-10-17 18:22:46 Buy $DPZ if you can’t buy the weed stocks!
636 2018-10-17 18:21:47 I worked with both as well as my friend this past weekend we took a shitload of big-oil stocks!
637 2018-10-17 18:21:26 Va falloir que les stocks tiennent le coup

639 2018-10-17 18:20:38 Tell me how companies not raising wages and buying back their own stocks helps their workers? Please.
640 2018-10-17 18:20:27 Stocks slide after Fed minutes point to more rate hikes 7/us-futures-point-to-a-muted-open-after-the-dow-soars-by-over-500-points.html
641 2018-10-17 18:19:45 fed wants to hike above neutral to put stocks in their place, make no mistake
642 2018-10-17 18:19:27 Are you buying $APH.to today if you don’t have any pot stocks?
643 2018-10-17 18:19:24 Many stocks in the sector have had a tough year. Flows into lower cost products hitting margins. Believe that was cited in BLK results this week. 

For me the "something bigger" is to ask what happens to the stocks if risk assets have an extended correction?
644 2018-10-17 18:19:06 ".In general, companies never cut their dividends unless they are really suffering. That said, the yield, as compared to other Dow stocks, can show which companies' shares have fallen behind and are due for a rebound." Daniel Myers, "Investopedia"
645 2018-10-17 18:18:54 You fools! Reforest. Terrestrial and undersea. Replenish fish stocks. The Journal #Nature made the case fish (and their poop) sequester an enormous amount of #carbon, where it is stored at pressure and low temperatures in our oceans and water bodies. Stop the piss take! #FakeNews
646 2018-10-17 18:18:49 I want to be long of energy names too, but I am a bit surprised the amount of rope longs give the names in light of what might be repeated rejection in crude and tough tape in stocks. In #PRM it is a sell the bounce, sell the bottom, sell strategy regardless.
647 2018-10-17 18:18:33 That was the key with #Cannabis and #gold #stocks last week. But now they change their behavior. That's why I sold my positions and move into an observer mode.
648 2018-10-17 18:17:49 Stocks fall back into negative territory after fed minutes.
649 2018-10-17 18:17:48 I don’t know what weed stocks you’re following but the ones I follow are not crashing $TLRY is up $15 since last week even being down $10 today; $CGC is up $4 sine last week down $2 today; $MMNFF is down .03 today almost $7 and was $4 a week $CWEB is up $.63 to $18.16
650 2018-10-17 18:17:24 If I start #trading in a volatile #market or correction, I want to see a lot of #stocks in a special sector and/or on my watchlists showing great setups. Than I pick the best technical setup and start a small position.
651 2018-10-17 18:16:26 Took a small position in $GPG, $RLTY, and $EAST today, liking the look of these stocks today.
652 2018-10-17 18:16:08 On other hand people buying and selling stocks or going into hedge funds or corporations buying back stock that is a problem.   Corporations do not hire or innovate and wealthy who play stock market do not put money in the economy.
653 2018-10-17 18:16:03 Have brought businesses back and even the left has to admit your 401k and stocks are doing much better. I’m a teamster and even I can see the boom for workers. He has kept and delivered on most of his campaign promises also. More than Obama and Bush.
654 2018-10-17 18:15:38 Good for my weed stocks
655 2018-10-17 18:15:25 Ya there are hundreds of examples like these... And still people are more interested in these types of stocks.. I don't know why...
656 2018-10-17 18:15:18 @tedcruz Honestly, the votes you'll be losing to Beto will be from a lot of millenials who are tired of Texas' outdated laws on marijuana. Pot stocks are booming, meanwhile it's illegal to smoke a joint for ptsd in Texas.
657 2018-10-17 18:15:12 I hate it when there are ads for "this stock could be like buying Amazon for $2.99".  First of all if you have your trade rules in place, you really should not be messing with stocks under $5 a share.  Secondly, well The Motley Fool has people all over the board writing for it.

679 2018-10-17 18:05:52 Perhaps the numbers weren’t sufficiently good to prompt further upgrades to forecasts so it’s a ‘sell the good news’ scenario. Growth/momentum stocks not so in favour as they were a few weeks ago
680 2018-10-17 18:05:07 $SA is another example. I had the expectation that #gold #stocks will move quickly. $SA did, but I expected a much stronger move. Especially the Monday candle signalized "danger". Today I sold the whole position  for a small gain. If the stock will move again, I will buy back.

700 2018-10-17 17:59:25 Could it be the result of propping up the highly weighted stocks in the index while the unweighted & broader stock market is tanking?

Do we see that in DJ30 in US?

712 2018-10-17 17:55:58 I’ll probably start shorting the Canadian weed stocks next week or so.
713 2018-10-17 17:55:30 A fundamental analyst in stocks would not talk about the R&D department for amazon (developer activity) or how the market feels about Amazon, or noteworthy news events for amazon. That would be called a speculative trader. 

On chain data and tokenomics make sense though
714 2018-10-17 17:55:11 Man. I'm weary of owning an entire portfolio of shit "deep value" microcap stocks that only move lower. What do you do when the strategy you've embraced for 30 years quits working? Liquidation followed by a long market sabbatical is feeling more and more like the proper course.
715 2018-10-17 17:54:46 TIL I scammed the economy six years ago by buying stocks at a lower price than they’re worth today. I didn’t realize that’s how economics worked, thanks.

722 2018-10-17 17:53:16 So, what would be in the minutes of the the last Fed meeting? Will it be a bit dovish by acceptening that they probably went a bit too fast on the hiking? I guess so. 
Expect stocks to rally, and with it $/¥ to pass the 112.5 mark. good that there is no a follow up presser by Jay
723 2018-10-17 17:53:07 Personally I think houses should not be a investment like stocks first.
724 2018-10-17 17:52:55 $CADC and $CCCL running. Chinese stocks are in fire today.
725 2018-10-17 17:52:11 FOMC minutes - only surprise would be a dovish one imho. #Fed has made it clear that recent dip in equities and rise in yields is of little concern at this point. Non-event will likely lead to resumption of the downtrend in stocks imho.
726 2018-10-17 17:51:51 And out... :) Double ups are always a great thing. Am watching for a re-entry point at .006. Man I wish I woulda got in GEVI at 60% up today. Watched it come and go...
727 2018-10-17 17:51:45 Revisit the pot stocks a few weeks from now after the bubble in pot stocks has burst.

5. Fed tightening and 10 year rate increase, engineered soft landing
6. Financial crisis from derivatives

738 2018-10-17 17:46:18 You have literally no idea what you’re talking about. The economy is between 1 & 1.5% smaller already- some estimates  say 2.5%. Inflation is up. Real wage growth down. Business Investment down 11% since vote. UK stocks devalued.
739 2018-10-17 17:46:18 I think after the first rush to be there at the head of the line up there wont be much interest in buying pot.
Company stocks will crash..it’s hype and i am not investing in this bubble.
740 2018-10-17 17:46:16 I sold them on Monday for nice gains. They recouped 1/2 of my drawn downs. $IWM is the weakest one, so I still want to get a short position to hedge my positions in case this is a dead cat bounce.

746 2018-10-17 17:44:00 Looks like the pot stock money may have moved over to the Chinese stocks.
747 2018-10-17 17:43:58 Instead of selling at the bottom try moving stops up as your stocks go up then get stopped out and buy back lower or at same price on the way up. Works for me when I can’t watch the market every second
748 2018-10-17 17:42:58 I am trying Trend Following so I have long positions with wider stops and trying to ride stocks for long term but 2018 is not a good year for me. Anyway, I had TVIX and VXX last week. When I saw VIX closed above 200sma, I opened $TVIX and $VXX to protect my longs. 1/2
749 2018-10-17 17:42:56 Lots of attention on pot stocks with Canada joining Uruguay as the only countries with fully legalized weed.

760 2018-10-17 17:39:05 Canada is officially pot friendly. 7-11 stocks have shot through the roof and narrowly missed a small group of star gazers that were stoned. Nobody knows how they got onto the roof.
761 2018-10-17 17:38:04 BTW Mr. President, did you know 40-50% of stocks are owned by non US residents? I’m sure your Saudi, Chinese, Russian pals have been in touch to thank you and reapply lube. Or perhaps you don’t even need lube anymore?

763 2018-10-17 17:37:08 Sounds rather like that $20 the economist won't pick up because if it was real it would already be gone. :) Most of the math these days is computing indices of some kind so one won't need to analyze individual stocks. Sort of an inversion if not perversion of the process.
764 2018-10-17 17:36:56 I'm actually quite reluctant to highlight any of them, as I've near zero tolerance of the mentality of most of those involved in such stocks. This morning was just another example, where ANY bearish talk, and the haterz appear. Its very similar to the gold bug mindset.
765 2018-10-17 17:36:41 So Netflix down 5% since the open today. Bulls on momentum stocks will surely insist on closing prices only (still up 3.7% from y'days close).

787 2018-10-17 17:28:03 Yes he’s very serious about advertisement of AMCs. Damn cute. He believes all those ads where they say we will ensure your tarakki, fulfill your dreams, continue traditions of trust, blah blah. If someone says we buy and hold growth stocks he gets mightily pissed.
788 2018-10-17 17:27:35 Treasuries selling off and Stocks rallying - wonder if the market knows something about the comments coming out in 30 mins.
789 2018-10-17 17:27:26 In fact, ownership of the stock tokens themselves is secured by laws and contracts that govern  stock exchanges and brokers.  A hacker cannot steal your stocks by just guessing a password.  If he does hack the NYSE database, law enforcement will ensure that the hack be reversed.
790 2018-10-17 17:26:49 #Stocks,#Indexes Tops today improbable.  SPX evidently has at least two days before any chance of a top, NDX maybe half that.  Emphatically, these are minima.  The rallies may run much longer.
791 2018-10-17 17:26:23 My $WEED stocks aren’t has high as I thought they would be today
792 2018-10-17 17:26:04 $HSGX if you're in with me on this swing, hold; you will likely be selling this over $1 next week

793 2018-10-17 17:25:59 Personally I’m sick of hearing about stocks from President Trump right now. I want to hear he has massive amounts of national guard Troops in place at our border ....turning these 2000 illegals around!!!

796 2018-10-17 17:24:37 #Cannabis stocks opened lower today & have recovered some of the losses, but the point is they aren't up. This is a lesson to anyone following markets. The rule of thumb is buy on rumour, sell on facts. Investing in a market where the money has already been made is not smart.
797 2018-10-17 17:24:29 $MGM $CZR $WYNN

798 2018-10-17 17:24:24 BEWARE: Breaking News! Mitch McConnell is blaming the Deficit on Social Security & Medicare and is looking to cut BOTH! The Deficit problem is the Billions in the Rich Man's Tax Cut's they gave to them self & Company's they have Stocks & Bonds or Interest! VOTE DEMOCRAT!
799 2018-10-17 17:24:21 Looks like energy stocks all collapsing
800 2018-10-17 17:23:47 Tell that to the dope (pun intended) who bought $TLRY at $300 in late September.  Current price is below $150.  I have bought and sold many cannabis stocks, but the space is getting very frothy.  Going to wait for a big break before I start buying again.
801 2018-10-17 17:23:30 Up or down, buy or sell, trading Canadian marijuana stocks purely because 17 October has come is ridiculous

1. We all knew the day was coming
2. Give it a minute, people

Investing > trading

Read the companies' financial reports.

Buy or sell based on your financial picture.
802 2018-10-17 17:23:02 don’t fucking @ me , but all these little guys that’s are constantly posting about stocks and trading like STFUUUUUUUU your so fucking annoying. No one cares or watches your shit. Go loose your money and Stfuuuuuuu.

809 2018-10-17 17:19:47 Buy back stocks have inflated the stock market, I expect a readjustment that will bring a dramatic loss for unready investors. Trump will be ready , he planned for this along with the rest of the gop.

813 2018-10-17 17:16:50 It means our company will become a public company that anyone can invest and buy stock from. That’s good for us because it drives up the value in a company when it goes public meaning stocks we were given when hired go up in value.  I think. lol

817 2018-10-17 17:16:18 Americans aren't allowed to participate in buying and selling of stocks in pot commodities because it is federally illegal. We are not intelligent enough to understand the amount of revenue we are losing out on. Not only in Investments but in taxes if we federally legalized.
818 2018-10-17 17:15:58 European markets have turned lower amid disappointing car sales, with auto stocks falling as much as 1.3%.
819 2018-10-17 17:15:50 US Stocks have drifted lower as the week’s second big serving of corporate earnings did much less to reassure bulls than the previously seen strong reports had done
820 2018-10-17 17:15:25 I honestly don’t see how stocks will ever stay lower.  The most incredible thing I’ve ever seen

830 2018-10-17 17:13:19 Stocks cut a big chunk of losses. Dow was down 300 points, now -50.
831 2018-10-17 17:13:18 Exactly what I was thinking! I have seen stocks move 20 to 50 cents get halted 20 times.
832 2018-10-17 17:13:04 I'm talking about the big boys. You invested you after tax money into some stocks. Small potatoes.

837 2018-10-17 17:10:23 yes, but I see activity and if you had experience with trading stocks it is really good sign. I hope #btc will get its place once again, other way #hashflare should use altcoins, but they are connected with btc too.. sadly
838 2018-10-17 17:09:29 @DayTradeWarrior do you know of any broker that accepts European customers, and that trades penny stocks ? I can’t use Interactive Brokers because of the pattern of daytrading rules. Please help me
839 2018-10-17 17:09:16 But some people totally got their $0.50/hr pay raise. Not @SenateGOP fault if people decide to spend it all on food and rent instead of buy stocks. Except that 50-cents is taxed 7.65% for SSN & Medicare, almost like we are contributing to a fund that will help us in the future...
840 2018-10-17 17:08:40 I check its price everyday, and I see know that #bitcoin really can go up - because the same situation happens at #forex sometimes, when stocks will grop - they can go down for a little. hope @hashflare will use the chance
841 2018-10-17 17:08:14 Same here, the cannabis stocks have skyrocketed & it is expected that the economy will benefit from new tax revenues

875 2018-10-17 16:57:42 Trading in stocks is dominated by computer programs.  Most investment strategies are trend following.  When an index falls below its 200 day moving average, the uptrend is often deemed to have ended.  Beware of computer sell signals around the 200 day moving average.

885 2018-10-17 16:53:30 Barry, bonds serve a different purpose. And they aren't going to 5%. A US treasury is a risk free asset. If you want a premium to match stocks, then accept risk. The 10 year is going to return below 3%. There is no necessity for the Government and its people to pay a welfare rate

901 2018-10-17 16:48:27 $AZO, $AAP, $IBM, $NTRS, and $ORLY are the top five stocks lower at noon today.
902 2018-10-17 16:47:25 Since both are abstract tokens, literally ANYTHING you believe regarding their value is literally "pretending."

You only are more comfortable pretending about the value of stocks because more people are comfortable joining you in pretending since stocks have been around longer.

905 2018-10-17 16:47:02 What if the youth is the reason for the bull market? Stocks rise from business growth which rises from consumer spending which apparently Millennials spend a lot.

910 2018-10-17 16:44:53 I would wait for the right entry but out of all the Canadian marijuana stocks if I was forced to go long I would go long on $pyx. It is legit. That’s why I shorted it. No manipulation to deal with.

917 2018-10-17 16:42:35 Interest rates are rising, which is bad for stocks. 
But rates are rising because the economy is growing, which is good for stocks. 
High growth could cause inflation, which is bad for stocks. 
But inflation could boost earnings, which is good for stocks.

923 2018-10-17 16:40:58 Canada's not only decriminalizing weed, but also taxing, regulating, and monitoring the industry's growth, distribution, and sale. That means Canadian pot firms can use traditional banks, trade stocks, and even sponsor medical studies.

964 2018-10-17 16:28:19 Thats bizarre that they did itthat way. In the US ( where its legal) they have to be completely seperate stocks because of the ammounts of THC in Medical stuff.  and you need different liscenses for the two kinds

971 2018-10-17 16:26:37 How is it that most people...

* Are in debt
* Have almost nothing in savings
* Don't know the difference between stocks / bonds

Yet suddenly, when it comes to buying a house, they're "investments" for their retirement 30 years from now?

Hint: This is the power of propaganda

1067 2018-10-17 15:56:18 Bro it’s called regaining losses?? Do you know how stocks work? Sometimes when they go down for a few days they then go back up. So it’s like they’re where they were originally. Everyone around you must feel so stupid.

1077 2018-10-17 15:48:02 Watching stocks like $F is it really necessary to offer Rebates (and Charge fees) for resting limits, hitting and taking? @nanexllc We don't need an incentive for people to trade stocks, all this does is add pointless volume & fees.

1080 2018-10-17 15:47:44 A helpful way to think about banks is that, at their core, they are just highly leveraged funds -- they borrow money (deposits) then invest in assets (loans). As such, a bank making lots of loans right now, is akin to an investment fund buying stocks at the height of the market.

1082 2018-10-17 15:47:12 confidence doesn't "fade" over night. Stocks had their biggest surge in 6 months yesterday, therefore it is cyclical for the them to retreat slightly!

1118 2018-10-17 15:37:03 Stocks rallied overnight, erasing some of the recent losses, with technology stocks leading Wall Street to its biggest one-day gain since March.
1119 2018-10-17 15:37:00 You can’t compare $PYX to other stocks, this is the only undervalued one out there that is associated to Canadian Cannabis. Should be at $100+
1120 2018-10-17 15:36:37 You have to remember pot stocks are just like any other asset bubble. After everyone buys only selling can occur. These evaluations are just insane. You can't have billion dollar valuations and no profits yet.

1161 2018-10-17 15:25:07 Let me give you a simple version of how this works.  When the stock market falls dramatically, two things should happen.
1) There will be some bargain stocks around because of overreaction in selling.  Buyers will create a mini recovery.
2)The president should resign

1181 2018-10-17 15:20:53 yes prudent capital management much like longing certain stocks before they appear on certain US tv shows which certainly isn't dart throwing and can be filed in the category of "prudent capital mgmt" :) :)

1185 2018-10-17 15:19:55 The ZSE equity market rebounding is a sign that demand for shares is slowly resurfacing after dropping last Friday.

1208 2018-10-17 15:14:39 Hi Helene. I've been wondering about the downside of the "ETF effect" ( people selling ETFs which then sell the underlying stocks). And I just thought that it would take at least a week, maybe longer, for that effect to be absorbed.

1212 2018-10-17 15:13:02 Wasn’t that exactly when they were a great buy? I wish I had bought a 13+% 30-yr at auction in 1981 or so. Not as good as stocks over that time but sure beat the historical avg.

1214 2018-10-17 15:12:31 Larry is right. Stocks go up and stocks go down and for now Netflix is much more likely to go down than up. As for all that content all it takes is one shot in the foot to take it apart. What content company has always succeeded and never failed? Never happened.

1218 2018-10-17 15:11:43 I answered <50%, assuming BTC keeps the purchasing power and not the nominal Dollar value. Most of the net worth would go into stocks, probably.
1219 2018-10-17 15:11:20 I just wasn't convinced that the pot stocks were staying up because of upcoming legalization when the market was getting crushed.  Felt like institutional investors accumulating - when they reversed to green when dow down over 500
1220 2018-10-17 15:11:14 Pot stocks?

1333 2018-10-17 14:44:24 Stocks are near the lows of the day as the DJIA drops 1.09%, 281 basis points. Participation in the sell-off is broad with declining issues outpacing advancing issues by 2,114 to 668 on the New York Stock Exchange.
1334 2018-10-17 14:44:20 I've come to realize that entire days in the Dow seem to trade like OTC stocks. Once they have people offsides, they push and push until the close where the leveraged ETFs buy everything from them. It's as if the days are not connected the way they used to be.
1335 2018-10-17 14:43:56 BREAKING. China denies trade talks "in the works" with the US. (Remember a "fake" story was floated out that there was when stocks were tanking last week). Stocks FALL...DJIA down 290.

1476 2018-10-17 14:16:07 I think what a lot of people overlook (especially those who are uber bullish weed stocks) is that there is still a pretty big stigma associated with mj use.

1523 2018-10-17 14:05:14 On #sentiment: the II data seems to be an outlier in that it shows little uptick in pessimism. Other indicators show more of shift from optimism to pessimism.

1583 2018-10-17 13:50:44 My stocks name
1584 2018-10-17 13:50:32 Cnd legalization is here, Pot stocks like $APH.TO, $ACB.TO, $WEED.TO look like they're selling on the news.
1585 2018-10-17 13:50:26 Tilray and MedMen stocks
1586 2018-10-17 13:50:08 Why? If stocks drops, you say none. If the stocks rebounds and make great, you want the credit Yours? Are you stupid or something Mr president?
1587 2018-10-17 13:49:48 Getting in on these marijuana stocks well in advance was a no-brainer.
1588 2018-10-17 13:48:32 In penny stocks Short Sellers always win, Some loose whole accounts because they don't set or follow a R/R plan.
1589 2018-10-17 13:48:29 No.The blame for ‘devastation’ of the U.K. fishing industry does not lie exclusively or even largely with the EU -that’s been a failure of U.K. govt.  And decline of global fish stocks might also be a factor worth being honest about.Brexit will hurt UK fishermen @CornishSkipper
1590 2018-10-17 13:48:05 Every time we have one of these big news days for marijuana stocks the whole industry drops. Every single time
1591 2018-10-17 13:47:18 When we were busy passing notes back and forth I said the pot stocks will selloff today.
1592 2018-10-17 13:47:16 Cannabis stocks are getting dumped, big-time.
1593 2018-10-17 13:47:01 Happy recreational legalization day for Canada  also lets hope my stocks in the cannabis go to the moon 
1594 2018-10-17 13:46:56 Buy the rumour, sell the news.   Pot stocks plunge in early trading on weed legalization day.  (most were lower Tuesday as well)  Aurora Cannabis opens down by 14%, Aphria down 10%, Canopy Growth down 8%.
1595 2018-10-17 13:46:55 News reports #CannabisLegalization stocks down 14% on first day! Not a high but a low! #Weed not offering a high! #marijuana #Canada is it another bad decision by @JustinTrudeau
1596 2018-10-17 13:46:50 Weed stocks - I guess the money was in anticipation of approval.  After is too obvious
1597 2018-10-17 13:46:38 Never invest in stocks with borrowed money or a faint heart. Both are fatal
1598 2018-10-17 13:45:59 Ugly out there no doubt, in Jan/Feb we recommended sitting on the sidelines for #potstocks -the absolute right call. Then in Aug $STZ $5B investment triggered the M&A boom, we went full bull when that hit the tape. Stocks are in play, stay in the sandbox. $aph.to $acb.to $trst.to
1599 2018-10-17 13:45:57 MJ stocks taking a beating. Who knew?
1600 2018-10-17 13:45:43 And why should they? At least 80% of Americans don't own stocks and don't care about the (soon to crash) stock market. Those who care can watch the business channels.
1601 2018-10-17 13:45:33 stock knowledge kahit walang stocks.
1602 2018-10-17 13:45:31 A lot of talk about fundamentals of low priced stocks and bitching about pump and dumps...who cares!? Trade the ticker and the price action, not the company.

We'll refund your money starting tomorrow since busy pa kami sa acads ngayon. Sorry po talaga 
1606 2018-10-17 13:44:59 Invest in REALLY long term stocks.
1607 2018-10-17 13:44:59 Called it before market open to sell the news - weed stocks huge dump. Thanks @TDAmeritrade for still not letting me short on paper. Since you clearly don't want to enable this feature I just write my entries now for shorts. Is it that hard to enable a bigger short list?
1608 2018-10-17 13:44:53 You said the president should resign if stocks fell 1000 in two days. It fell 1300. You need to resign.

1619 2018-10-17 13:41:32 There are "non-voting stocks" which are not fully shares of the company because they don't give voting rights.  But those are not the rule.  

How many votes do you have on the board of "your" company?  Does your company hold shareholder meetings?
1620 2018-10-17 13:40:37 Hello my friend I don’t trade commons or options  I just trade stocks long not short you know why because I found out it’s the only way to make money

1629 2018-10-17 13:38:41 Same here. Most of my money is super boring dividend growth stocks. Occasionally I'll sell call spreads or buy puts if I get bearish on the market as a whole.

1632 2018-10-17 13:37:42 The NASDAQ managed to regain its 200-day moving average, but still only 37% of NASDAQ stocks are above their own 200-day lines and the Russell 2000 as well as the Value Line indexes are below their 200-day moving average lines.

1634 2018-10-17 13:37:12 Those who trade stocks of companies that they know nothing about are just as dumb as those who trade cryptos.  Day-trading is not investing: it is a form of gambling, where one gambler's gains can only come from some other gambler's loss.
1635 2018-10-17 13:37:03 How limited are the stocks?
1636 2018-10-17 13:36:39 Dow futures were lower this morning after U.S. stocks saw their best day in nearly seven months. The rally Tuesday trimmed the Dow's October loss to about 2.5 percent, with the S&P 500 off 3.6 percent for the month and the Nasdaq still down about 5 percent.
1637 2018-10-17 13:36:13 California legalization provided an obvious sell the news, yet cannabis stocks continued to rally for a few more weeks. Maybe the second time around is different, because awareness has increased enough that the sell the news will work this time.

1642 2018-10-17 13:35:29 People act like this is cash that they have sitting around...it’s all tied up in investments and stocks that literally control other things in the world.  Huge impact if they sold it all immediately

1644 2018-10-17 13:34:39 At this point, people use stocks like NFLX as a store of value, hoping they will outperform just holding dollars. It's probably not gonna end well...

There should be better background checks. When the amendment was written. There were no AR 15s, AK 47s or bum stocks
1674 2018-10-17 13:27:32 The difference is brought about by the fact that allegedly 1 bond is not equal to 1usd?

Firstly compared to other stocks which are listed on both markets. Old Mutual is the most stable thus ideal for the comparison.
1675 2018-10-17 13:27:09 Everyone wants to believe *their* pick is the next Paladin.  The reason Sprott/Rule reference Paladin is because this was an unusual exception, not the norm.

1678 2018-10-17 13:26:24 Pot Stocks are getting some "sell the news" follow-on after y'day reversal. $NFLX had $400 sellers & needs to get back over & hold $385 for still higher. Below can chop & pullback. $IBM is down another $5 after it was down $3 in after hours & I said there is more to go.
1679 2018-10-17 13:26:03 If you're worried about a sentiment shift towards growth stocks (as recent price action may have suggested), then $NFLX is a sell up here

1684 2018-10-17 13:24:30 @GuayakiMateBar I need to stop telling people about Yerba Mate because the only store in town that stocks it literally can’t keep it on the shelf for more than a day. They stocked yesterday morning and when I went last night there was 1 left. I drink at least 7-8 a week. What now
1685 2018-10-17 13:24:18 My stocks still have not recovered.
1686 2018-10-17 13:24:09 I for one am excited bc the pot stocks have done very well on this run up 
1687 2018-10-17 13:23:55 $spx #stocks rates down because of flight to quality didn’t remove risk! FOMC minutes could spark selloff. It’s tough to find a trading range for near term given big 3Q rise then last week’s dip. 2800 area may be support and resistance until midterms but I see 2900+ by mid-Nov.
1688 2018-10-17 13:23:10 Given that you only watch Faux, how would you know? I heard about the stocks yesterday but I also heard about the drop last week. Why didn’t you mention last week’s losses?

I would advise to keep checking our website for any future re stocks.

1692 2018-10-17 13:22:49 Don't know where #cannabis stocks end today but as a #cannabis bull, I prefer red opens vs. green opens.  That said, we'll use deeper pullbacks to reload some of the overage we sold into the recent run.  Process is independent of price.
1693 2018-10-17 13:22:38 Look at cannabis stocks go....down 
1694 2018-10-17 13:22:16 Do you believe they are overvalued considering the valuation of other cannabis stocks with larger facilities and potential output? Such as Canopy?
1695 2018-10-17 13:22:16 Don't want ur open sale,please keep it urself. When we want? tht time u showing ur demands and keeping hold out of stock. We bought other mobiles Realme, Honor. I much awaited for mi mobiles but no stocks.

1698 2018-10-17 13:22:01 Hi Erik, it really depends on whether real yields also rise as 10yrs hits 6%. In the late 1960's nominal bond yields went from 4 to 8% but real yields fell 250bps as CPI accelerated to 6%. Stocks did far better than fixed income.
1699 2018-10-17 13:21:45 Thanks Tom - it's a really difficult prediction - could perhaps be that weak £ helps FTSE100 but hurts smaller Stocks. I think it's an extremely low possibility but I'm staying cautious as could cause Recession in UK and Europe.
1700 2018-10-17 13:21:27 As a shareholder of #MMJ stocks, I wish they ran up uncontrollably, but it is nice to see a true market forming around the companies. Actual value being put on good or bad news.

1715 2018-10-17 13:17:54 You called our stocks crap.. we didn't call @ShopMedMen crap.
1716 2018-10-17 13:17:50 Not all bond selloffs are equal. Bonds sell either for (1) rising inflation, or (2) a default risk. Rising inflation doesn’t mean the govt will default. In (1), bonds and stocks correct, but currency rallies. In (2), currency collapses, bonds and stocks crash.

1720 2018-10-17 13:15:03 $TLRY $NBEV $PYX $CGC $CRON this isn’t a drill these stocks could fall 50% today been warning you greedy bastards all week.
1721 2018-10-17 13:15:01 He owns 50% OF ALL THE CONCRETE THINGS THAT ARE INSIDE OF THAT ABSTRACT BOX.

Sorry, but it seems that you don't know the very first thing about how stocks work.
1722 2018-10-17 13:14:28 It became legal and stocks went down a little.i know it’s about to rise again sha
1723 2018-10-17 13:13:58 All you people buying marijuana company stocks because of legalization.... I'm buying Frito Lay stock.
1724 2018-10-17 13:13:22 I have gathered that stocks primarily rise bc debt money it’s bot in.

I’ve heard the most salient case for why stocks otherwise move is bc “they” buy/sell by earnings to keep up a consistent narrative that the stock market is an aggregately economic smart agreement.
1725 2018-10-17 13:13:18 Did I miss the train for investing in pizza stocks? #CannabisLegalization #canadacannabis
1726 2018-10-17 13:13:15 Omg I have fake stocks in my finance class but they’re not doing so well HAHA
1727 2018-10-17 13:12:59 @smartertrader @dumbertrader @smarter411 Stocks go up stocks go down. Pay me 500 a month but i wont show you my losses. Come join everything goes to 0. I beat on GS cos they wouldn't hire me but they make 10B ,  No one likes SaM.

1731 2018-10-17 13:11:48 A recovery is not a "strong day". People lost a lot of money last week and yesterday was a mere correction, as the market does from time to time. Your dumb ass has clearly no idea how stocks work, just pointing out your own fortune @nytimes story and validating it.
1732 2018-10-17 13:11:37 Does not affect most of us who do not have stocks. Going to comment tho on those big losses the other day?
1733 2018-10-17 13:11:24 Not liking premarket $TLRY & $CGC wishing both of them well as these are two torchbearer stocks and face of #CAMJ #Potstocks at a global scale - whether hate brigades likes it or not.
1734 2018-10-17 13:11:05 But you don’t want credit for stocks when they nose dive?!?!
1735 2018-10-17 13:11:00 Time to buy stocks! Do exactly the opposite of what @LandM_Marius recommends! He's full of shit and has no idea what he's talking about.
1736 2018-10-17 13:10:47 Stocks to Watch: Netflix, IBM, United Continental, Facebook, Tesla
1737 2018-10-17 13:10:35 I feel like buying stocks in #Lays or #Doritos is a missed opportunity in #Canada today. 
#legalizationday
1738 2018-10-17 13:09:49 Maybe you are watching the wrong networks. They have entire shows dedicated to the stock market. People that are affected by stocks don't go to CNN or Fox and Friends for market news.
1739 2018-10-17 13:09:43 MSNBC has a ticker on all day showing the market. So many of us need to watch the market because we are so heavily invested in stocks!   I checked 401K on the 2 day's it declined, not back up there yet.
1740 2018-10-17 13:09:41 pot stocks will go up in smoke
1741 2018-10-17 13:09:21 Lots of PSU stocks, explains low PE !
1742 2018-10-17 13:08:43 The latest “this time is different” fallacy:  small stocks are defensive. Weaker balance sheets and greater economic sensitivity have never been defensive characteristics.
1743 2018-10-17 13:08:18 I think most of the suggestions being made to you are how the businesses will perform whereas your question seems to ask how the stocks will do. On the latter, no one knows despite what they say. If we could know what stocks would outperform when, we’d have eradicated poverty!
1744 2018-10-17 13:08:14 When the tariffs unravel and my stocks go down even more, I’m going to be even more pissed than I am now.
1745 2018-10-17 13:07:50 MJ/CBD stocks may be "hot" again today...these are the ones I'm holding:  RLBD...KYNC...IGXT...EHVVF...GGTTF...and ICNAF...SODE...TGIFF.....Best all...
1746 2018-10-17 13:07:35 Can you invest in stocks or something?

1752 2018-10-17 13:05:41 #yesbank #yesbankdevelopments why ??? It was loud and clear from RBI earlier ..Why to poke again and again to further dent stocks and investor sentiments?? Is Mr Rana Kapoor irreplaceable???
1753 2018-10-17 13:05:41 Taking a directional position on most stocks (i.e. tech which is mainly priced on expectations $NFLX) just before earnings release is gambling IMHO. However, you might want to short vol in some highly anticipated releases. I don't do it, but might be worth looking into. Anyone?
1754 2018-10-17 13:05:37 Dear, RNGeezus
Either give me a good drop in runescape or make my stocks go up... I can’t be broke in two realities... it’s not fair...
1755 2018-10-17 13:05:35 Canada is decriminalizing weed, and also taxing, regulating, and monitoring the industry's growth, distribution, and sale. That means Canadian pot firms can use traditional banks, trade stocks, and even sponsor medical studies.
1756 2018-10-17 13:04:53 Yeah thousands dead in earthquake and tsunami, peope killed in hurricane Michael, but yeah it’s more important than money in stocks. Idiot in chief! Shameless tiny man!!
1757 2018-10-17 13:04:44 Everyone is jumping for joy that marijuana is now legal in Canada meanwhile I'm jumping on the idea of investing stocks in 7 elevens, Macs convenience stores, Circle K's, Hasty market, Couché Tard's and some debunked Beckers. #legalizationday #CannabisLegalization #WeedWednesday
1758 2018-10-17 13:04:32 Don’t sell mnga stocks this morning folks
1759 2018-10-17 13:04:25 Long game is right @renegadestyle as I hold only long term positions that will become more in demand.  Maybe it is not the best plan or the flashy stocks that make the news but I truly believe that in 3-10 years these positions will be at levels that will even surprise us.
1760 2018-10-17 13:03:58 Morning Market Update: stocks trade lower as volatility returns to the market.
1761 2018-10-17 13:03:08 Oh but really happy for you and all your rich friends.  
How about the majority of the country who don’t own stocks?  Sorry man I will keep fighting for them while you keep trying to pull the wool over their eyes. #SAD
1762 2018-10-17 13:02:23 Bogle says to put all your stocks in the US market because the risk/returns have been better than diversifying globally (not true). Then he counsels to just buy large cap (the index) stocks when the returns on small/value have been much higher. 

Hero worship can get confusing?
1763 2018-10-17 13:02:21 Anyone with an IRA or company retirement plan “has stocks” that’s LOTS of Americans!!!
1764 2018-10-17 13:02:06 Canada legalizó y los stocks por el piso lol
1765 2018-10-17 13:01:06 I wonder how the old, white men who so strongly support the "president" will react when their Social Security income is cut off, or reduced next year?  Maybe those red-necks rely for income on their stocks and bonds, like Trump's buddies at Mar-a-Lago....
1766 2018-10-17 13:00:57 It’s a good trading setup for different types of strategies. Momentum traders would short the stock or cover profits on longs. The mean-reversion traders would buy it because stocks historically go up more than down.
1767 2018-10-17 13:00:52 This lady who stocks the skills lab THREW AWAY MY RED BULL you better bet I was about to throw hands that was $3
1768 2018-10-17 13:00:28 Perhaps the bigger story is why YOU didn't address when stocks dipped drastically the past few weeks?

If you can take credit for their rise, does it not stand to reason you are to blame for their fall?
1769 2018-10-17 13:00:23 would you like equal news about the bigger drop from oct 10th? because stocks are not as high as they were then.  stop being a jackass.
1770 2018-10-17 13:00:15 MJ stocks pointed lower on the inevitable sell-the-news the day is here strategy.
Still never understood the psychology around that one other than it clearly exists.
Guess it falls under the what have you done for me lately approach (forward looking markets)
1771 2018-10-17 13:00:06 OptionHacker alerted traders to bullish unusual option activity in 16 stocks Tuesday including $GRPN, $DE and  $ALLY.   Top performer was a same-day gain of 26% in $DE where November 165.0 calls bought for $0.25 closed at $0.32.

1776 2018-10-17 12:59:32 With pot being legalized here in Canada today.. Doritos and Mountain Dew stocks might be a smart investment #legalizationday
1777 2018-10-17 12:59:31 You stupid son-of-a-bitch, if you’re  as wealthy as you claim to be, you’d know that the stock market fluctuates constantly. That’s why nobody got excited when it jumped up, it goes up and down DOTARD, in case nobody told you that. Which stocks did you invest Putin’s money in?
1778 2018-10-17 12:59:29 This would also hurt the economy, let’s face it unlike the money given to corporations in the tax cuts, often used to buy back thier own stocks, or build cash reserves, seniors actually have to spend most of this money to live on.
1779 2018-10-17 12:59:26 You forgot inflation up while wages are down, huge deficit scaring markets (stocks tanking), big layoffs coming due to trade wars and rising materials costs (Harley, auto makers), none of our allies trust us, kids in cages, & massive corruption. Let's talk in 12 months.
1780 2018-10-17 12:59:19 You said  ZERO when the stocks had that big drop the other day. WOMP WOMP, big baby!  You didn't tweet nothing about it. #STFU
1781 2018-10-17 12:59:16 That is mega cool hey are you doing stocks for tots again this year?
1782 2018-10-17 12:58:51 if you own the stocks, then the drugs just got cheaper ?! #BTFD
1783 2018-10-17 12:58:44 This just reminded me to check my stocks that I suck at keeping up with 
1784 2018-10-17 12:58:18 80 stocks is actually what several 5* mid-cap funds hold. Dont be surprised to see some of them matching this list.
1785 2018-10-17 12:58:12 I should have bought stocks in Visene when they were cheap.
1786 2018-10-17 12:57:44 Wtf? They have laws that ban Tesla? Do they also have town criers and put people in stocks?
1787 2018-10-17 12:57:33 I KNOW! My stocks haven’t come back up to where they were.
1788 2018-10-17 12:56:58 I dont block people. I calmly discuss many topics with people all across the internet while trading stocks and options in the morning and playing poker at night.
1789 2018-10-17 12:56:56 And whoever stocks the fridge with Diet Coke and steak is probably getting a bonus.

1803 2018-10-17 12:51:36 It’s usually the person who hasn’t lost a fortune on Canadian stocks.
1804 2018-10-17 12:51:30 It is also time BJP starts talking about what it stands for, vs. why others are not worth standing with. In any case, just like low interest rates = stocks are better, bad other alternatives = bjp is the only option we have.

1807 2018-10-17 12:50:15 One learning people get by experience: Penny stocks never become multi-baggers. Usually a big hope stock [dream multibagger] that becomes a penny stock.
1808 2018-10-17 12:50:10 While I agree a blockchain like bitcoin can make sense for true bearer stocks. I just don't see any good reason to put a non-bearer assets on it. A blockchain main property is immutability, if you don't want that property at all, why use it? Go for a DLT instead.
1809 2018-10-17 12:48:38 Since sub-prime bust, low interest rate makes undisciplined market.Due to the fact that the banks are still have no clue or really are crooks.
Consumer buy Amazon goods on debt, while investors buy Amazon stocks on debt. This bubble bust will be worse anything than we ever seen.
1810 2018-10-17 12:48:35 @SagarRV1 Hi Sagar !! How do you see the PE of all the nifty indices?? they are at all time high ... Individual stocks may have a different status but these indices are olaying with the mood of overall market ... what are your thoughts ???
1811 2018-10-17 12:48:24 It was mentioned with the message that it wasn't 45s fault the stocks were down
1812 2018-10-17 12:48:17 European markets turned lower, dragged down by auto stocks after news that European #carsales dropped sharply in September.
1813 2018-10-17 12:47:30 1/ Specifically, the round disc was first approved on 21 August 1914 and was intended to replace the older pattern, though aluminium discs continued to be issued until stocks were exhausted - 1915 to 1917 dependant upon stores (and nationality!)  ...
1814 2018-10-17 12:47:15 The big companies are not putting the money back to the employees they reinvesting in their stocks and giving crumbs $2 raises and they are getting millions.  You like scraps.  When a rich person/ comp says they dont need another tax break  then it's to much.
1815 2018-10-17 12:46:29 I’m investing bourbon distilleries.  I’m thinking alcohol stocks are going to soar starting mid-2019 thru the next presidential election.  I might be able to retire off the dividends.
1816 2018-10-17 12:46:24 Repito las econ no tienen knee jerk reactions como los stocks hay q verlas a largo plazo. Las deciciones de Hoy, no se ven a corto plazo.
1817 2018-10-17 12:46:21 No. That’s again not logical. You are an equal shareholder/stakeholder in U.K. We have a democratic system that elected MPs who made a law for the vote. The majority (on a huge turnout) went to leave. That’s exactly how public stocks would work. Majority at an AGM. That’s it.
1818 2018-10-17 12:46:17 I heard more about the stocks from Networks yesterday than I did from you on the collapses the previous days.
1819 2018-10-17 12:46:14 Big congrats to my Canadians and #legalizationday  Shout out to all my homies up in Canada, smoke it up and enjoy, I’ll be enjoying my rise in stocks today while y’all enjoy the high
1820 2018-10-17 12:46:05 Just because your interested, doesn’t mean everyone else is. Instead of worrying about the stocks, how about you worry about the missing journalists everyone seems to brush to the side. Im sure his family wants answers.
1821 2018-10-17 12:45:17 I agree, my stocks increased! I'm glad to see this tweet
1822 2018-10-17 12:45:15 All your points are speculation. How about N Korea, Iran, new NAFTA agreement, Stocks up, jobs up, consumer confidence up, black employment up, Hispanic employment up, hostages home, POWS home... I can keep going.
1823 2018-10-17 12:45:15 The world stock markets are going to have a few good days and then it’s going to crash all the way into mid to end November. Hold on to your seat Mr Buffett & Kie & Banks (bank stocks will be nailed to the wall)  - this is Divine Judgement!

1826 2018-10-17 12:45:06 You take credit for all the good with the stocks. Do you take credit for the stocks falling too?
1827 2018-10-17 12:45:06 Because it was the market bouncing back after a massive drop in Tech stocks and DOW #doyourhomework
1828 2018-10-17 12:43:44 Parallels with the Q1 correction in stocks have been drawn and I find them  apt given underlying motivations appear the same – i.e. higher % have triggered concerns about equity valuations @TDANetwork @OJRenick

1843 2018-10-17 12:37:31 Wages stagnant, stocks plummeting, tariffs hurting small businesses and farmers and you are still an arrogant, narcacistic despot wanna be.

Large Value = +12.5%
Small Cap = +13.1%
Small Value = +15.1%

Country “B”
Market Index = +10.4%

Small Value = +16.8%
1846 2018-10-17 12:35:34 Congratulations, Dolt 45, on increasing the gap between wealthy and poor Americans, keeping wages stagnant, & record level deficits. Once corporations stop buying their stocks back, the GDP will drop, recession will set in, & it will all be rightfully blamed on the GOP and YOU.

1849 2018-10-17 12:33:55 People should pay attention to things like housing starts, mortgage applications, mortgage rates, downgrades of home stocks like Lowe’s & Home Depot. This are good economic indicators. We should also pay attention to rural #America. They are struggling & #Trump economy not there.
1850 2018-10-17 12:33:42 What a joke @BarrySchwartzBW on @BNNBloomberg is regarding pot stocks. 2007 interview he says "you're going to lose all your money if you invest in these companies". Oh ok.....so the 800%+ return people have made is considered a loss?

1857 2018-10-17 12:31:37 Pot stocks are all priced as if they’re generating billions now. All Canadian co’s selling off into legalization? Maybe the top is in for now..

1863 2018-10-17 12:29:52 I like this. Current justice/prison system is stupid, but the comfy prison option that is loved by the Left is stupid.  It’s just section 8 housing with room service.

Public flogging and the stocks should make a comeback for petty offenses.

1890 2018-10-17 12:23:11 I believe stocks like $wgo and $thor are important for the markets health.  $wgo beats income and revenue this morning.  These stocks are down 50% from highs and display discretionary income trends.  We’ll see if the gains hold!

1898 2018-10-17 12:20:33 There’re all sorts of problems with stocks:
1. Expenses can be manipulated in either direction
2. Insiders know way more
3. Accounting statements are time-consuming to make (esp for startups) and hard/long to analyse for regular investors.

Now go on and build security shittokens

1902 2018-10-17 12:18:45 Oct 17th is upon us. Will PR and news start dropping left and right, or will the pot industry begin to bleed back down to obscurity? These stocks have been distracting lol! (Though lucrative)...

2333 2018-10-17 07:56:51 Stock futures dancing around positive and negative b4 European open. One would expect a 3digit gain after one of the bubble stocks crushed the earning and should help lifting rest of the group as traders alluded to prior to the report especially after a HUGE bounce yesterday
2334 2018-10-17 07:56:50 In the results section of the IC they try to cover all or most major stocks.  Yes given the number they cover it is not hard to find their mistakes.  But a lot of the stocks they got wrong seemed to have flashing red warnings signs on them.  But they just believe the hype IMO!

FYI in case you've got money in them. It could continue, but typically w/o a catalyst, traders take profit.

2575 2018-10-17 04:55:19 Wow. Guess I won’t be using FedEx to ship my guitars from England. That’s messed up. Head stocks don’t just break off by themselves
2576 2018-10-17 04:53:56 S&P 500 12month forward P/E is 15,7 Below 5Y average of 16,3 but above 10Y average of 14,5. Tech sector valuation is not in a bear market -especially FAANG stocks :-)
2577 2018-10-17 04:53:35 Or Pot stocks (Tilray for one). Market cap of a single company >$22B in an industry estimated to be $20B in 2020. And that Company isn’t allowed to sell in the US, the single largest country. Classic case of investors testing the product before buying
2578 2018-10-17 04:53:31 Hope NBFC stocks are not even in your watchlist

2584 2018-10-17 04:46:48 never invest in junk stocks. buy mutual funds or index funds. or companies with high roce
2585 2018-10-17 04:46:44 I'm probably the millionth person to suggest this, but invest in penny stocks to cure your bipolar disorder
2586 2018-10-17 04:46:02 I knew buying all those Doritos stocks would pay off one day. #legalizationday
2587 2018-10-17 04:45:57 Yup its about managing the stocks. Nagarkoti has been injured for a while. We need to make sure these guys get enough games and don't lose their hope of playing for the country. Having so many talented bowlers also lets us rotate and rest them regularly.

2590 2018-10-17 04:40:38 Yes our fast bowling stocks look excellent. This is a luxury we haven’t had for years . It’s all about making use of it now.  Siraj looks the most likely candidate to graduate to intl cricket . Others needs a bit more refining I guess.
2591 2018-10-17 04:40:36 As you move to end social security and Medicare to the people that need it the most; they don’t own stocks you bozo.@realDonaldTrump

Maybe you misread what i wrote, was referring to crypto related stocks IB made unshortable last yr ( $GBTC $RIOT $MARA) $TLRY was added few weeks ago, can still use options to create & hold though. This is universal to ALL accounts at IB
2598 2018-10-17 04:36:25 Well,
Other side of the coin:
If some1 stocks leaves, (who does not consume) such ratio would become high n becomes pile, 
It would turn into lucrative business, 
Moreover, it may cause the increase in habituals and 1 day it would be difficult to control the manic.
2599 2018-10-17 04:34:48 Job opening for prison guards for you junior mint. Gas at 4 year high stocks tanking and prices rising in all goods while wages are stagnant. We can’t take much more winning
2600 2018-10-17 04:33:23 Weed finally legal in Canada. Now let the stocks go up!!
2601 2018-10-17 04:32:14 Stocks definitely, maybe like marijuana since it’s becoming so big (but that’s in the moment)
2602 2018-10-17 04:31:24 you need buyers to dump your stocks.
2603 2018-10-17 04:30:58 Canada got the weed legal tomorrow and my stocks been jumping
2604 2018-10-17 04:30:32 How is tZERO a “con job”? Can you explain it or just spouting drivel?

OSTK rode a hype cycle. It wasn’t some big scam or pump job. At the time, people in stocks looked for exposure into cryptos — the market clearly wasn’t rational.
2605 2018-10-17 04:28:41 Really should have started investing in stocks a lot earlier but better late than never
2606 2018-10-17 04:28:25 announce oil reserves inflate stocks, announce coal reserves inflate stock, secure bank loans, announce npa's. it was a reckless full blown cronyism, the sad part is people still believe MMS is saint and sonia is evil, he is the biggest culprit.

2624 2018-10-17 04:17:29 Since I’ve started looking into stocks, Ive discovered things such as Canada is legalizing marijuana tomorrow, and Nike is releasing some pretty dope shoes this Thursday. Also Thursday and more importantly, I’ll see Waka Flocka. S’go
2625 2018-10-17 04:15:43 It’s actually really good time to be getting off into stocks
2626 2018-10-17 04:13:49 So am I @TheTweetOfGod . US politics is just one big SNL script. Watching from up North. Oh btw God, thanks for pot and pot laws up here. Stocks are doing great
2627 2018-10-17 04:13:41 stocks rise by 1%.
2628 2018-10-17 04:13:10 Throw your money in some stocks before it’s too late
2629 2018-10-17 04:12:55 Tell that to all of the people that voted for you living at or below poverty, working 3 jobs just to make ends meet that can't afford to buy stocks.
2630 2018-10-17 04:11:37 Don’t feel left out in the rally.  From now to elections markets will be very volatile as always in election year 

Time to build great portfolios. 

Also my request.  Please don’t mail and ask me name of stocks and funds. Hope you understand. 
2631 2018-10-17 04:10:36 Are you kidding? Stocks have been bouncing around like rubber balls! You can't claim that! Job numbers? Where do you pull these numbers out of???????

2636 2018-10-17 04:08:24 Yo this past month I’ve super gotten into stocks and I’m making some money . Can’t wait to see my dividends pan out
2637 2018-10-17 04:07:57 Of course people with more money will have more stocks. In other words. The top 10% have the highest credit limit and pay the most taxes
2638 2018-10-17 04:06:35 You forgot to tweet about the stocks taking a nosedive the last two days.
2639 2018-10-17 04:06:29 I don’t subscribe but don’t they have recommendations for most listed stocks (at least the major ones)? If so, not surprising you will find their mistakes if you search for the ones that have crashed. It would be very impressive if they were able to preempt many of them...
2640 2018-10-17 04:04:38 Same get camped and timed out one game the next 2 stocked and take both stocks below 70
2641 2018-10-17 04:04:15 May increases our sexy tough guys stocks. He'd throw you up against the wall and have his way with you I reckon.
2642 2018-10-17 04:04:05 The only ones that care about stock are the rich, and jobs wow you still need more than one job to be able to survive to put food on table and pay all the bills, I did not see you tweet when stocks went down last week.
2643 2018-10-17 04:03:14 uh-oh, Vanguard is transitioning to an all-brokerage platform, which means it'll be super easy to pull money out of my index fund to mess around with individual stocks. @deerang quick remind me I'm not allowed to play in the sandbox until I've paid off my student loans

2646 2018-10-17 04:02:27 So disregard what my stocks, mutual funds investments, employment status has been doing for the last two years? Is that how it works?
2647 2018-10-17 04:02:03 Im anti-trump, but the reason why Americans don't like to save money and invest in stocks is not his fault... its 100% because of the spending habits of the average American citizens.
2648 2018-10-17 04:01:50 Considering Ken’s shoryu was always stronger than Ryu’s I’m ready to take stocks at 40

2654 2018-10-17 03:58:19 Crypto, measured in percentage against time. No bubble in stocks atm. Don't use the word bubble lightly. Cannabis is getting into bubble territory now.

2666 2018-10-17 03:47:16 Market looks strong today! Nifty above 10600 and sensex above 35500. 1% up! Go for fundamentally strong stocks... stay away from microcaps for now. #StockMarketToday #StockMarketNews #nifty #sensex

2701 2018-10-17 03:23:41 Law of supply and demand, kiddo. These are regular items, the store is profiting from it. The more regularly priced items and stocks, means the demand for that is huge. Stores only mark it down if its not saleable and would not restock for it. Hence, sale items and low stocks.
2702 2018-10-17 03:22:42 In the long run you did them a favor. Although I can see how appealing it can be, I made more % this last 2Q than the previous 2 years trading just stocks.

Advice on stocks.
2704 2018-10-17 03:21:08 When are you going to realize that pretty much no one in your base (those deplorables that show up to your lie fests) own stocks. So that message falls on deaf ears.  Also, it fell 1500 pts then rose 500 so bfd.
2705 2018-10-17 03:20:01 LOL

Since you're in Silly Valley, I figured those folks are insane enough to have a store that stocks it.
2706 2018-10-17 03:19:17 Do you have a 401K plan that has mutual funds?  If so, it's nice to meet someone besides me who own stocks.
2707 2018-10-17 03:18:16 I am up early today and feeling the same. Think we both hold a few stocks with massive news due... 
2708 2018-10-17 03:18:02 "cube stocks drop" gurliz if you're not a cube stan and only know how to butt in if there's an issue, shut up.

2711 2018-10-17 03:15:36 You know how to start buying stocks ? I want to try buying one with apple
2712 2018-10-17 03:15:17 Totally random and weird, but totally true:

one of the reasons I place GTC sell orders is in case something happens to me at least I know my stocks will still sell at their targets when/if they hit. 

anybody else? no? okay, see ya tomorrow.
2713 2018-10-17 03:15:16 at least for stocks. if earnings growth prospects are 4% and bonds are 3.5%, people will pay the premium up to 4%.
2714 2018-10-17 03:14:19 Stocks down a 1000 points last week!
2715 2018-10-17 03:14:18 @megasafemoney I would like to invest in marijuana stocks
2716 2018-10-17 03:13:56 I finally took over 20 stocks in cruel smash. My ledge planking is on another level now 
2717 2018-10-17 03:13:26 As I said, broaden your view. The reality of the JSE doesn't match. Yes there have been low liquidity stocks, but there have been many other options and many other stories, not all (or even majority) "buy high, sell low suckers".
2718 2018-10-17 03:12:52 Who won the modifieds and the last 2 races?? We had a 2 1/2 drive home we had to leave.. it was the modifieds hornets street stocks we missed
2719 2018-10-17 03:12:47 Stocks plunged as The Charles Schwab Corporation unveiled a unpleasant mirror today.
2720 2018-10-17 03:12:21 I missed $BIT but am in at the bottom of $SUDOC with a decent position
ASX query on volume/price I suspect should be dealt with soon
Seems like these #biotech stocks don't have an upper limit of logic so I'll just ride it out on the long expiry options
Any deal could be huge!

2727 2018-10-17 03:06:55 It seems incorrect to me on the basis the same time frame he followed with a contradictory post that this was not a Compound Fulcrum.

I’ve observed numerous people seek clarification on his declaration over several weeks, yet forthcoming.

New factor. Stocks affecting prices.
2728 2018-10-17 03:05:17 Currently in training and all their talking about is foreign exchange, trades, etc etc.

Hey a girl can dream!
2729 2018-10-17 03:04:51 Will there be stocks that go up?  Of course there will be. But we don’t play indv equities. And it’s likely prudent to remain % in equities
2730 2018-10-17 03:04:30 Yea. But numbers way up in stocks. Check your portfolio!
2731 2018-10-17 03:03:44 Why bother with some stocks that have lousy corporate governance, bad promoter history, and keep coming on TV to pacify investors. Look at companies that have always been winners in their sector. Super Management is rare and only few know and appreciate shareholders.
2732 2018-10-17 03:03:13 As of 11:00 a.m., PSEi 7,120.05 up 133.03 points or 1.90 percent.  #PSEiupdate #PSEi #stocks
2733 2018-10-17 03:03:02 The statement wasn't abt the number of ppl who own stock, but the NUMBER of stocks owned by super wealthy, vs. everyone else. I believe about 1/2 the people in the US own stock, just not a lot relative to the rich.

2735 2018-10-17 03:01:58 Lots of money has been made in the market on ipo by very few people.  With only about 20% of stocks being sold and with half of that reserved most investors  get about 10k. Price shoots up, giving larger investor a huge windfall. While suckers buy high, then sell low
2736 2018-10-17 03:01:17 I-T  may probe tax evasion through F&O trades. I-T officials suspected tax evasion through the capital market. In 2014-15, the DG of Income Tax, Kolkata prepared a report detailing how penny stocks were used for over Rs 80,000 crore in evasion of long-term capital gains.

2745 2018-10-17 02:58:41 Many asset allocation models have performed because of the negative correlation between bonds and stocks.

2753 2018-10-17 02:53:12 It dropped the other day I guess all you greedy friends have made money with their profit taking..As soon as the little guy gets into the market it drops so the 1% can buy up stocks. I wonder if anyone had insider trading info..Mueller might want to look into that.
2754 2018-10-17 02:53:00 If you ever feel bad about your trading or investments. Just remember there are still people out there tweeting about their #DRC exposed EV stocks!

2762 2018-10-17 02:49:00 I'm sure they are not buying Tech stocks on this rebound. Tech is going to continue its selloff.
2763 2018-10-17 02:48:54 I’ve been trading pot stocks for 4 years. Mostly sub .10 range.  — And I’m not an investor.  MJ market heating up.
2764 2018-10-17 02:48:20 Truth is ,people who bought crap have shorted quality stocks now
2765 2018-10-17 02:47:32 Here’s the quote from the article:
“There is little upside to play for with Aurora as the stock already spiked 15% when the listing was announced and now trades at the same premium as the US stocks. Better values can be found elsewhere.”
2766 2018-10-17 02:47:08 .@SenateDems @NancyPelosi @SenSchumer 
Here’s a solution to bring down the deficit:
REVERSE the.@SenateGOP  tax cuts, maybe reverse some MORE?

The 1% doesn’t really need it, corps. are just buying back stocks..
2767 2018-10-17 02:45:06 Only 47% of the American population own stocks. Inflation is outpacing wage growth. The deficit will rob the middle class of social services while you continue to cut taxes on the wealthy. We are awake. Our eyes are open. We are losing not winning.
2768 2018-10-17 02:44:16 MSM only reports went stocks go down. So obvious they want you to fail!  MAGA sir!

2776 2018-10-17 02:42:07 84% of all stocks owned by Americans belong to the wealthiest 10% of households.   

“For the vast majority of Americans, fluctuations in the stock market have relatively little effect on their wealth, or well-being, for that matter,” said Edward N. Wolff, an economist at NYU.
2777 2018-10-17 02:42:00 Analysis: Stocks are still down 700 points for the week, and jobs are being added at a slower rate than they were under your predecessor, meatbag.
2778 2018-10-17 02:41:48 Looking back at our capitalist past, really shows how cool capitalism was.  I mean, only stocks that were providing real value would rally. And money was scarce.
2779 2018-10-17 02:41:42 Too bad I was stuck in garbage oil stocks today and missed the rally. Let oil prices soar. You owe me.

2790 2018-10-17 02:36:17 That’s not true but if you cut them they showed what they do, they pocket them and buy their own stocks back to profit more. Also the Koch brothers did a study on what Beto supports, it showed less cost than current system. The Koch brothers lol. We spend trillions on endless war

2814 2018-10-17 02:23:14 Good question! In non-economics life, yes. In Macroeconomics GDP, Investment focuses on business investment (capital, inventories) & new construction (household and business). That’s why stocks + bonds aren’t considered investment in GDP, even though ppl view them as investment

2825 2018-10-17 02:16:25 Tax Cut benefits all Americans, it doesn't. But the 1 Trillion dollars used by corporations to buy back their stocks has helped the very rich add substantial  $$ to their coffers. And pay for #LyinTed ''s campaign.
2826 2018-10-17 02:16:18 #youtubetvdown @twitter usage up stocks of youtube down the tubed lol
2827 2018-10-17 02:16:17 You hit on it. Stocks a proxy for putting cash in play. Exchanges are nothing but casinos today.
2828 2018-10-17 02:15:57 Not here to argue Canadian stocks are way over bought right now. Get ready for the HUGE sell off.
2829 2018-10-17 02:15:43 Every time I try to trade bio stocks I have a hot, barbed poker inserted into my anus and then it is torn out and I am bashed over the head with it for good measure.
2830 2018-10-17 02:15:18 tomorrow weed is legal in Canada I better make some bank off the stocks 
2831 2018-10-17 02:15:06 @realDonaldTrump ppl in china do not care about stocks   even if your 267b is added.
2832 2018-10-17 02:14:54 sure.. but when California news dropped I took it as a negative and so did stocks because their lawmakers can’t bring it fruition. They were the first to vote it through but those in charge still can’t agree on how it’s all going to work. Nonetheless...
2833 2018-10-17 02:14:29 LOLOLOLOLOL u guys totally deserve this. Like, YouTube has acted like absolute shit the last year and a half with no content management, and this is karma. Enjoy your plummeting stocks!

2837 2018-10-17 02:09:08 #BetoORourke ...Drunk driving...allegations of “hit and run...”  O'Rourke had purchased seven stocks, including stock in Twitter, at IPO prices, seeing a 39 percent increase on shares that he sold either the same day or within days of IPOs. Illegal.
2838 2018-10-17 02:08:15 Let me get this straight 
You’re calling @binance a fraud and supporting #tether ? 
If you’re bearish on crypto long term just leave, go back to stocks
2839 2018-10-17 02:07:53 There's not really sufficient data, on overall debt flows and stocks, nor on the outcomes of the lending to really know conclusively what's going on. Added to which, the circumstances are probably different across projects/countries too.
2840 2018-10-17 02:07:26 Vimeo stocks rising
2841 2018-10-17 02:07:23 Very rarely will the E&Ps move before the new contract. 

Low monthly is most likely in. the big down day on no short interest stocks like MRO usually is the low day of the drive.
2842 2018-10-17 02:06:42 I need to buy some more weed stocks honestly. I sold everything I had knowing I should’ve kept em smh.
2843 2018-10-17 02:06:24 China offshore listed stocks are also pledged and margined which usually do not appear in official figures.
Most IPO proceeds are used to buy Reg S High Yield bonds on leverage to generate a stable double-digit (Net yield) income stream
2844 2018-10-17 02:06:18 So vimeo stocks
2845 2018-10-17 02:06:06 Looks like you only bought PSUs..normally people with even little head don't invest in PSUs. Bcoz largely in India PSUs don't create wealth..
Like coal India, NTPC,PSUs are only meant for trading
If u are long term investor, most of the stocks are still up 200 percent in 4 years.
2846 2018-10-17 02:05:59 Earnings rule the day as stocks soar led by NFLX.  Dow up 547. NASDAQ up 214.

2848 2018-10-17 02:05:34 $tlry $cgc $cron $pyx $nbev the day California became legal most California pot stocks prices dropped 50% within two days. I sure hope people get out safe tomorrow going to be ugly

2851 2018-10-17 02:05:02 What if the "assets" aren't traditional stocks, bonds or real estate, but instead are claims on future delivery of actual goods and services. Think vouchers, tickets, & commodity tokens. So instead of a share of appl stock, you can buy a token that grants delivery of a new iPhone

2853 2018-10-17 02:01:43 Do penny stocks until you get the hang of it. Basically you pay whatever a stock is worth at the time(really an equity into the company). Then, whenever you feel like it, you can cash out for whatever the stock is worth at any given time.

2856 2018-10-17 02:00:00 In my opinion I would tend to believe the doctors who co-authored the journal article, Dr. Liau,  the patients who survive using DCVAX-L, the exceptional work by Senti & Flipper on i-hub, Smith on Stocks, Branko and the long tail we are observing over Adam Feuerstein. $NWBO

2859 2018-10-17 01:58:50 Legal weed in Canada coming in the next few hours, albeit the infrastructure is not nearly ready for the coming demand. Anyone else keeping a close eye on what happens with the stocks involved tomorrow?
2860 2018-10-17 01:57:52 Stocks going up!
2861 2018-10-17 01:56:46 U weren’t around in 2014 w these stocks were you!?
2862 2018-10-17 01:56:40 Did their stocks hit bottom ?
2863 2018-10-17 01:55:13 Perfect time to buy the stocks then
2864 2018-10-17 01:55:13 $SPY As I have in every correction, I'm not waiting for new all time highs to buy stocks. My risk is considerably lower, here.
2865 2018-10-17 01:54:43 Short selling is a term in investing, not sure what it would mean with selling cars. It would not benefit them by not bringing revenue, production problems with Tesla have done zero good for them as a company and their stocks have taken hits because of it
2866 2018-10-17 01:54:20 Todd, I've been in meetings since 2PM then on the road, what happened to the MJ Stocks across the board today..? thanks

2872 2018-10-17 01:51:54 TBH, definitely not an expert (in stocks or Alibaba). However:

1) Chinese government in general adds risk to any Chinese company
2) Jack is leaving

Additionally, not risk, but I think Chinese protectionist policy has a huge part in their domestic success.
2873 2018-10-17 01:51:22 Ah cool Maryland and D.C > 
2874 2018-10-17 01:51:12 Tech stocks are using earnings like a drunk using a lamppost; for price level support rather than illumination.
-Twain, kind of.

2875 2018-10-17 01:50:16 No selling medical stocks! No capitalizing on medical cannabis. We want low prices, not to satisfy stock holders! #cannabis #norml
2876 2018-10-17 01:49:56 What exactly do you trade? Precious metals, stocks and bonds, gems, furs and pelts, or lastly... Pokemon cards?
2877 2018-10-17 01:49:32 You are right about US except those arecthe wrong stocks and are crap.
2878 2018-10-17 01:49:30 @wkalunji @CA3532 I would dare say that most are bearish on the markets and watching stocks go higher while on the sidelines.
2879 2018-10-17 01:49:18 I hate to tell you but the entire "crypto currency market is 72bps relative to US stocks, and about 25 bps relative to global stocks, Barely the pimple on the @ss of an elephant.
2880 2018-10-17 01:48:22 yep!! maybe sell my tech stocks for junk food stocks!

2882 2018-10-17 01:47:29 Im not ok with people who were never even fans to begin with saying cube is over etc and that you won’t support cube. As a universe that is really hurtful, think about the other artists before you rejoice abt the stocks falling etc. I’ll always support Hyudawn AND Pentagon

2891 2018-10-17 01:42:50 It's a fallacy to think of #Buffett's cash pile as trying to TIME the market. 

There's not enough deals in the $30-40 billion range. 

If you are struggling to find stocks to deploy your "tiny" 1L or 1cr, and sitting on cash, it's LAZINESS!

2893 2018-10-17 01:42:06 In this instance, t 1% screwed t GOP. GOP gives big tax brk to corps assuming wage incr & infrastr invest wld increase t tax base. Corps raised divs & bought back stocks instead. Since GOP has no tax base increase, debt rises. They blame excess spend on soc serv? They got played
2894 2018-10-17 01:41:27 the day they truly fix the site is the day google stocks hit an all time high
2895 2018-10-17 01:41:09 @DragonGuyAndGal do your cats also pick your stocks? Is this how Mrs. DG was able to retire!???!
2896 2018-10-17 01:40:40 The original statement by cube last month said they were both fired, then their stocks dropped so they were “discussing it” and hyuna was pissed they weren’t even told in the first place about the firing and terminated her contract. Edawn is part of a group so wdk what he will do
2897 2018-10-17 01:40:31 Might just be me but based on volumes so far there doesn’t seem to be any real interest in any but a couple of stocks. It’s up cause Wall Street is up. Kind of has a bull trap/dead cat bounce feel to it so I’m not buying. Idk.
2898 2018-10-17 01:40:08 Hmm, if the top ten percent of Americans own 80 percent of the stocks then how do foreigners own 40 to 50 percent of them. That doesn’t add up one bit.
2899 2018-10-17 01:40:05 US stocks closed higher with the DJIA up by more than 500pts as earnings season kicks off with better than expected corporate earnings.
2900 2018-10-17 01:37:43 Invest in stocks and shares! But remember donyour research first before investing any money. Good luck
2901 2018-10-17 01:37:28 Talking about personal stocks in Twitter is no way helping, rather self promotion and sometimes pump and dump game by artificially pumping up stock price.
2902 2018-10-17 01:37:07 Need to make 10k on this $NFLX tomorrow. #stocks #money #America
2903 2018-10-17 01:36:52 -50% is insta fire. The bubble was obvious. And did not hedge because supposed to follow the herd? Why would anyone pay 2-20/30% for that? Just buy the top 10 cryptos and HODL.
 
Stocks and fixed income PMs hedge. All the time.
2904 2018-10-17 01:35:01 Need a list of your stocks @realDonaldTrump.  Average American’s like me are seeing a dive.
2905 2018-10-17 01:34:55 Yes.

I was referring to stocks, dunce caps, scarlet letters and the like.
2906 2018-10-17 01:34:32 The Prices of Canadian legal weed is cheaper off the street so just remember that when you all ask what happen with this pot of gold Marijuana hype & the STOCKS.  Who in the right mind gives money away when its cheaper down the road from shadow Sammy & his bag of tricks
2907 2018-10-17 01:33:52 I believe all Brokers (stocks & futures) having the same margin calls at around 2:30 PM

I never had a margin call in my trading life, so I am not sure about the timing

But I do know: short squeeze or long squeeze margin calls would extend the daily trend by a lot after 2:30 PM
2908 2018-10-17 01:33:30 Yeah I was wondering if it’s time to buy pizza stocks.
 
2909 2018-10-17 01:31:35 Clearly it’s worked ... tech stocks dropped after trump threatened additional tariffs on China. (Sarcasm intended)

2917 2018-10-17 01:25:24 Cramer isn't responsible for you actions. I love his insight but never blindly buy stocks he likes (except CRM last week). And he was weary of the pot stocks before the open today, on Twitter & on the air. Sold TLRY @ open & CGC yesterday @ close.  @cryptoniclion80
2918 2018-10-17 01:25:05 Shorting stocks just feels dirty.

Shorting crypto?  Pfft.  Click bam.
2919 2018-10-17 01:25:00 It really does not matter to a great extent which stocks or coins you follow and trade, as long as your follow them closely. The ones you study the most will yield the best results since you will have a good feel for the ebb and flow. @BigCheds
2920 2018-10-17 01:24:56 Ah, now I get it. Is this primarily for mutual funds/ETFs or individual stocks? Would seem to make sense more for funds/ETFs eg. sell Vanguard small-cap fund, buy Fidelity small-cap fund.
2921 2018-10-17 01:24:26 You should pay more attention to the cigarette volume declines.  Accelerating to the downside in each weekly report.   Every time you attack juul you send the cigarette stocks up.  Market is sending you a very clear message.
2922 2018-10-17 01:23:39 I don't need his core values. I don't like him as a friend or drinking buddy. I need him to not be another crack-pot lifetime politician that wants to selectively ignore laws to their, or their friend's benefit.

I've had enough of the lies. I love how my check/stocks are doing.

2943 2018-10-17 01:10:11 Hardworking Americans are screwed when the rich dont pay their taxes.

Yeah the stocks are doing well but wages are stagnant, benefits and pensions are being cut and Trump blew up the deficit by another 17%. Facts dont lie. You've bought the narrative like a good little #sucker
2944 2018-10-17 01:09:45 I'm sorry but that's not true I'm in Wall Street all the time I also buy and trade stocks and last week for 3 days the market drop really big time so don't use Wall Street to bring people to the voting polls for you it will not work be honest for once in your lifetime
2945 2018-10-17 01:09:07 Tim is a scammer, his followers (the “successful ones” are affiliates, full of shit, who take a cut by being his shills. He lost a huge amount of money when he ran a hedge fund. If tim was really making a fortune trading penny stocks then he wouldn’t be teaching his “secrets”
2946 2018-10-17 01:08:28 Fishkeeping is serious business.

2947 2018-10-17 01:08:27 I totally agree. It drives me crazy that we (eNGOs) are automatically assumed to be radical. It’s such a pain. Some of us have huge campaigns that simply want to end overfishing and rebuild stocks. We often carry industry positions. Demonizing us is just convenient.
2948 2018-10-17 01:06:50 I've got to adjust to buy the dip on stocks like BLNK. I thought it was fluffy news because EVSEs being on Google Maps was natural progression and they aren't the only ones on Gmaps and it was dipping on the 1st wave but continuation happened despite slow day
2949 2018-10-17 01:03:45 There was also a lot of shorting of airline stocks from Saudi Arabia right before 9/11

2951 2018-10-17 01:02:08 In other news, weed becomes legal in Canada tomorrow. Pump on the stocks or dump tomorrow morning? 

TA says dump (dark cloud covers on most weed stocks today), but news says pump on legalization day. I try to stay away from gambles like this.

2954 2018-10-17 01:00:35 In a surprise twist, the US stocks overnight have gone up by 2 to 3 per cent.
2955 2018-10-17 01:00:30 I can relate to this 100 percent I feel like I have to tools now for success.. being in this market is like being in the hyperbolic time chamber of stocks.
2956 2018-10-17 01:00:15 I think everyone waiting for some more big moves... Most of what I hear lately is how the stocks have rebounded and may be done it's correction. Crypto is eriely quiet on the TA side of things (relatively speaking). Something is brewing.
2957 2018-10-17 00:59:00 I am working on changing some of my trading habits. I would be lying if I said I wasn’t scared of change but after many hours of research on top of the hours I spend studying stocks and trying to understand stock patterns, I do believe that this coming change will be good.
2958 2018-10-17 00:58:19 We should meet up sometime. Bolan's and Looney's are my regular spots...
2959 2018-10-17 00:57:55 That's what I've been saying for months now - unfortunately I can't afford to buy any snack company stocks right now. Besides, there will always be people buying snacks, pot or no pot.
2960 2018-10-17 00:57:29 FUCK YOU TWITTER. setting behind the screen being judge jury and hangmanwe the American people are going to Fucking Destroy You. Your stocks are dropping and yiur going under. Your scared shitless you commy sons of a bitch FUVK YOU!!!
2961 2018-10-17 00:55:36 After the Oct 1 massacre, republicans promised to ban bump stocks. They lied. Heller voted to end healthcare for people with pre existing conditions. But republicans want us to believe MS 13 is the REAL problem. Lmfao Early voting begins Oct 20, vote @RosenforNevada
2962 2018-10-17 00:55:35 They're both good stocks Jai.

But you can't make things happen before the time is due which is later this year/2019.

$DXB is stupid cheap and has been for some time
2963 2018-10-17 00:54:19 How to be better:
1. Work out so hard you either come close to throwing up or passing out
2. Put your phone away and spend some quality time in nature
3. Buy land and stocks
4. Cut soy out of your diet completely
5. Listen to Beethoven

2966 2018-10-17 00:51:00 Ban on bump stocks? That’s what she said.
2967 2018-10-17 00:49:08 And I guess biggy Biggs doesn’t care that a huge number of Americans don’t have 401(k)s and that these largely depend upon a robust stocks/bonds market, which is increasingly a dodgey bet.
2968 2018-10-17 00:48:52 I need more sources of income, who’s educated on day-trading, stocks, investments. Hit my DM’s there’s too much money to be made.
2969 2018-10-17 00:47:15 The uniqueness of cryptogame is not "game will be investment instead of just entertainment" but "user can raise the value of own asset by himself". Once you buy stocks or cryptocurrency, you can not do anything. But in cryptogames, you can raise your asset value by playing games.

2974 2018-10-17 00:42:21 naive and clearly you dont trade stocks, these institutions knows how to trade and margin
2975 2018-10-17 00:42:06 Stocks going up next month 
2976 2018-10-17 00:41:49 Westpac reports: Despite a lift back above trend this month, the Index growth rate continues to point to slowing momentum heading into year end (Leading Index for Australia) #ausbiz #ausecon #XJO #investing #stocks
2977 2018-10-17 00:41:36 I don't think she deflected at all. She flat said she supports the 2nd amendment, universal background checks, and banning bump stocks.
2978 2018-10-17 00:41:20 Brian I am a total newbie working my butt off in stocks & now in options. No one advised it before. Do you have a youtube channel or something where you can teach about forex? You are a learned man and know more than these furus out there. Would be great to have your lessons.
2979 2018-10-17 00:40:52 are you going to ESGS to pick them up? I'm on a trial run for these scath items so my stocks are very limited, I only asked 10 for standees and 5 for tapestry x_x
2980 2018-10-17 00:40:08 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
2981 2018-10-17 00:39:55 é que os stocks subiram mesmo por causa dos BTOB and some folks are all happy abt this quando na realidade these sweet boys are just being used, julgo que um deles ate esta no exercito...

Meanwhile CLC is still in the good ole cave
2982 2018-10-17 00:38:56 on the flip side... my dad wanted to buy weed stocks for the legalization in canada lol
2983 2018-10-17 00:38:33 Gary probably got in like 5 years ago lol. Like how he bought FB stocks from Zuck’s parents before they went public
2984 2018-10-17 00:37:56 President Trump interest rates are not problem but tech stocks are  , getting inflated too much with little inherent value. Also doing harm to society and future generation. It’ll be good if you act on tech companies after election .
2985 2018-10-17 00:37:32 That is why we got tax breaks, increased jobs, highest stocks ever and better trade deal. It’s okay keep drinking the cool aide
2986 2018-10-17 00:37:09 Not only does your math on who owns stocks not add up, but wages aren't stagnant. There are more open jobs than the official number of unemployed. So, wages are going up faster than they have in years and government data shows this.

2988 2018-10-17 00:34:29 I believe stocks and face to face facts. Not something a biased news media will shove down the throat of incompetent America
2989 2018-10-17 00:33:57 Watch Cannabis Stocks get Super Inflated & then collapses on y’all 
2990 2018-10-17 00:33:37 Dougie like it better when you talk about market and stocks and not how you can’t watch something on tv. Love me some volatility
2991 2018-10-17 00:33:12 with all these bio stocks popping..when is $IMC turn? lool
2992 2018-10-17 00:33:06 Seems to be something between a phone and a smart watch. The inconvenience of a phone combined with the worst a watch has to offer ... I don’t get it either, maybe this means I should buy stocks.
2993 2018-10-17 00:32:45 But bump stocks do increase rate of fire, which would make sense to either ban or heavily regulate them even though they can’t turn a a semi automatic weapon to a full auto.
2994 2018-10-17 00:32:45 2/  tracks allowing “pure stocks” to look like late models with similar technology= insanity.   Must have street stock class with strict low cost rules.   Bonus: crate engines do not sound like race cars.
2995 2018-10-17 00:32:09 I definitely agree that they are all over the place. You also need to file a form to get a suppressor and I’m genuinely unsure about the legal process to obtain bump stocks because it’s not something I am interested in purchasing, neither is my boyfriend for his rifle.
2996 2018-10-17 00:31:48 Numbers do not include the 35% of stocks owned by Soros 
2997 2018-10-17 00:31:32 Q2 I don't order online unless its a rare item that no one stocks because I need 1. Delivery to work site and a person to call whose name I know if an issue arises. 2. consistent Refunds policy. 3. Warranty drop off point for tools. 4. Customer Service #Tradestalk
2998 2018-10-17 00:30:31 Explain to me why stocks with a div yield like $f are generally risky buys?

3000 2018-10-17 00:30:10 ...I have a problem with growth-stock investing. Companies tend not to grow at high rates forever. Businesses change... Markets mature. Competition can increase. Good managements can retire... the market is littered with once highly profitable growth stocks... -- Ed Wachenheim
3001 2018-10-17 00:29:38 This is a great tribute but I am curious about the @60Minutes interview where Paul mentioned that he overheard @BillGates and Steve Balmer talking about diluting his stocks ... need to know what that’s about before taking this seriously.  RIP Paul Allen.
3002 2018-10-17 00:28:50 Watching some matches of ultimate one area was doing a tournament with 3 stock and 5 mins and they still finished at a decent time. Like I really hope we get 3 stocks for ultimate in tournaments.
3003 2018-10-17 00:28:07 @thunderlipstv looks like from your past charts you got caught up in the sykes scam!! how you like trick trades? I was a member for 1 month but seems like he goes over the same stocks every day
3004 2018-10-17 00:26:14 At that point I'm left wondering why anyone would bother to play college football at all. Bowl games have made (and - yes - broken) draft stocks for an eternity.

I'm not saying I think the players are necessarily making a mistake. I just don't like it.
3005 2018-10-17 00:25:19 Social security is a dumb and failed program. No single nation has a successful program like it. It should be abolished or made voluntary so people can opt out. Forcing people into buying failed stocks is coercion. It is theft.
3006 2018-10-17 00:23:50 Sana all may stocks. Ay.
3007 2018-10-17 00:23:17 Secondly if the remaining assets lose 40-50% of their value aka bonds and stocks just imagine the carnage. How will those payouts be funded? Answer they won’t be. hence my previously posted comment that anyone under 50 years old will never see their payouts.
3008 2018-10-17 00:22:47 I recently got into investing in stocks so let’s see how this little test goes.
3009 2018-10-17 00:22:40 Everything crash with Obummer people has to file bankruptcy etc stocks crash or did you forget that your just a Trump Hater
3010 2018-10-17 00:22:35 @rihanna is there anyway I can buy #FENTY beauty stocks? And/or can you slide me one of your shares? Thank you in advance for everything.
3011 2018-10-17 00:21:53 why aren’t more people shorting pot stocks. most have less cash then accounts payable with billion dollar valuations and low revenue. Financing more debt for expansion in a rising rate environment rarely works #PotStocks #ValueInvesting #investsmart @DougKass @jimcramer
3012 2018-10-17 00:21:00 So if your LT pension assumptions require an 8% ROI in perpetuity to fund payouts. And 60% of your investments are at 2% or 3% aka bonds you need to make north of 10% maybe 12% on the remaining 40% to remain funded. So stocks cannnot grow 12% forever.
3013 2018-10-17 00:20:20 Cant beat market short term. Go long term 5 to 10 to 20 yrs. And choose basket of various stocks. China still have over 500 to 600 millions potential pop to become middle class long term
3014 2018-10-17 00:17:08 Curious if the "sell the news" will apply to #cannabis stocks tmrw
3015 2018-10-17 00:16:37 ADBE turned out fine, but I think it’s based on fundamentals. It’s one of the tech stocks that are solid top and bottom line growth
3016 2018-10-17 00:16:07 I'm glad you enjoyed yourself! Thank you so much for coming out.
3017 2018-10-17 00:15:40 how does it play? ... do i need to preorder now before you give a rave review and trigger stocks runnning out

3022 2018-10-17 00:11:46 Drives me mad when I hear the lazy line 'High growth stocks at risk if they disappoint...' 

Reality is no one is safe from disappointment in the late Bull Cycle. 'Value' play $TRS today case in point. 

Please Mr Market stop with the generalisations. Thanks #investing
3023 2018-10-17 00:10:15 Sanger: "It means the release and cultivation of the better racial elements in  our society, and the gradual suppression, elimination and eventual  extirpation of defective stocks - those human weeds which threaten the  blooming of the finest flowers of American civilization."
3024 2018-10-17 00:09:27 Plus a long long time ago I didn’t buy $MO (when all the tobacco lawsuits killed that stock). I’ve always regretted it (because I’d be retired now if I had). So maybe $MU can make up for it! They both start with an M and are two letter stocks!?!  Ha! That is heavy duty analysis!
3025 2018-10-17 00:09:16 netflix, +19% in after-hours trading.
it helps to turn around high tech stocks shrink?
3026 2018-10-17 00:06:20 Anyone invest in stocks too?
