7 2018-09-18 23:21:35 Cuando suben la tasa, se aprecia el dólar y los commodities se deprecian. A fin de año hay legislativas en EEUU. Eso nos puede ayudar.
8 2018-09-18 23:18:31 I get self-improvement and learning new things. Lately I've been expanding my plumbing skills and eating more greens. But I will never regard people as commodities on some kind of sexual market, bc that's bullshit, my darling. It doesn't even make sense.
9 2018-09-18 23:05:53 True.  Also, remember in late Spring when the commodities “experts” said gas prices were going to skyrocket this summer and it would cost the avg American an additional $200 to fill their tank?  That was all about Trump and the Iran/Kerry deal. #CNBC

39 2018-09-18 22:12:01 The way to make a small fortune in the commodities market is to start with a large fortune. ��
40 2018-09-18 22:11:05 State antitrust laws applicable to corporations but not to individuals, or to vendors of commodities but not to vendors of labor, have been upheld.
41 2018-09-18 22:01:12 Eleição tem pouca influencia no longo prazo da bolsa em minha opinião. Mas influencia STF, STJ, TSE, aparelhamento, universidades, etc. A postagem sobre eleições sou eu na física como cidadão. Como gestor, ciclo econômico e commodities é de longe muito mais importante.
42 2018-09-18 21:52:27 No nos cagan. Nosotros nos cagamos solos al tener una economia que depende principalmente de los commodities.

Estamos en el siglo 21 y seguimos produciendo como en el 19....
43 2018-09-18 21:49:54 Spine and dignity are scarce commodities these days.
44 2018-09-18 21:26:56 I dont think anybody really realizes the actual significance of #bitcoin as an invention. Civilization was born out of city-states centered around temples that taxed and stored commodities in exchange for receipts. Bitcoin marks the end of Statism, and the beginning of a new era.
45 2018-09-18 21:23:43 Your time and energy are your most valuable resources and commodities. Use them wisely.
46 2018-09-18 21:11:48 Gold can’t be destroyed by fire, water, or even time. And unlike other commodities, gold doesn’t need feeding, fertilizer, or maintenance.
47 2018-09-18 21:09:49 YESTERDAY WE SAW THE COMMODITIES CURRENCIES CAD, AUD AND NZD ALL HIGHER AS MARKET TOOK PROFIT ON SOME SHORT POSITIONS WITH AUD TOUCHING A HIGH OF 0.7224. TODAY WE SEE THE RANGE OF 0.7190/0.7240 AS WE HAVE RBA'S KENT SPEAKING AND BOJ POLICY ANNOUNCEMENTS EXPECTING NO CHANGE.

49 2018-09-18 21:05:51 Foh, both BM and WM fetish each other to be honest, white women want 2 have the black experience through them, BM treat white women as commodities that they achieve to show they made it. It's just that the white womens fetish may be seen as racism bcos of the history
50 2018-09-18 20:56:05 No es "cambio" onda "Cambiemita", binaria mononeuronal. Voy mas allá, trascendiendo décadas. Venimos pifiando hace ratazo y demostramos andar bien solo cuando el mundo tira favorablemente (tasas bajas, demanda externa, precios de commodities, etc ) sin lograr estructuralizarlo.
51 2018-09-18 20:55:05 Nada disso, a questão é: O PT efetivou a mesma politica economia, cambial e orçamentária do PSDB e arruinou o Brasil ( talvez para sempre). Com o agravante que o PT teve ao seu dispor o maior ciclo de valorização de commodities da história do capitalismo e não reformou nada
52 2018-09-18 20:54:56 The problem is too few owners own and train the vast majority of the good horses . Horses like Nelson are used as commodities when they would be stars of a small stable . Kew Gardens was pacemaker in Derby and won the leger. little attention is given to legacy and spectacle!
53 2018-09-18 20:48:02 just talking about commodities in economics.
54 2018-09-18 20:42:07 Day three: The humans have bought a multitude of commodities. They have locked me in one of them.
55 2018-09-18 20:41:44 said the wildly successful commodities trader
56 2018-09-18 20:37:47 By the look of the grain lines in Owensboro, we have not started in earnest, on farm storage has yet to reach capacity, or we discovered bagging commodities.
57 2018-09-18 20:36:35 I would like for politicians to stop talking about jobs like they are commodities
58 2018-09-18 20:34:00 Predators:
Target the less experienced (often younger) & physically weaker.
Lower status/power position.
Count on societal grooming for cooperation & silence.
Do not differentiate sex from assault.
View others as commodities to use rather than people with which to share.
59 2018-09-18 20:32:39 El argumento es que parece muy complicado y te pide que estudies más para que digas como hacerlo, porque solo sabe que existe el intercambio de commodities pero no de conocimiento.
Tres meses para alguien bien entrenado aprende y mucho.
60 2018-09-18 20:31:03 I’m sick of buying everything made in China. Time to spread their commodities around the poor countries of the world.
61 2018-09-18 20:23:15 yeah probably because he is the 3rd option or more on most plays and diggs/theilen are proven commodities that they know they can trust. Need to give it more than 2 games (with a legit QB) before jumping off the ledge.
62 2018-09-18 20:20:00 Es que el problema es siempre estar dependiendo del azar y del clima para obtener una buena cosecha. Acá lo que hay que hacer es ordenar las cuentas de modo de que sin importar el precio de los commodities, la economía camine igual
63 2018-09-18 20:06:32 Hillary para mi era una continuidad que al menos no son perjudica como esto, habia una complementariedad. Trump te corta exportaciones, deprime commodities y después a lo sumo te presta guita
64 2018-09-18 20:01:28 If we aim at recovering looted public money, we'll even lower the current 16% VAT on other commodities. We'll have surplus.
65 2018-09-18 19:53:24 Owners of Nigeria are the business moguls in oil & gas, commodities, banking & finance. They have cozy relationship with whichever Govt is in power
66 2018-09-18 19:50:08 Imagine how much good could be done with the billions spent on election campaigns. Why does a campaign have to go on for years? Politicians are the worst value for money commodities out there.
67 2018-09-18 19:40:33 That particular celeb is just another cabal minion: "She is a great-great-granddaughter of Léopold Louis-Dreyfus, who in 1851 founded the Louis Dreyfus Group, a French commodities and shipping conglomerate, which members of her family control into the 21st century."
68 2018-09-18 19:36:05 The patriach runs the whole circuit, from oil and gas to commodities to telcoms all via proxies and shell companies; Yet he maintains a large followership in the military! Nobody gets near the corridors of power without his endorsement ( fully or partially).
69 2018-09-18 19:34:05 I agree with you, the way humans treat most animals is horrifying...everyone is posting about the seven dogs left to drown locked in their kennels, but the pigs and chickens  are considered commodities...
70 2018-09-18 19:32:21 Ese es el rasgo más característico de los psicópatas neoliberales, y del neoliberalismo como doctrina: la consideración de ‘los demás’ (los que no son de tu cuerda) como simples commodities.

Darwinismo social elevado a la enésima potencia.

Son psicópatas. Son criminales.
71 2018-09-18 19:29:34 I miss the commodities of the USA. Someone send Ben & Jerry’s half-baked and crunch Cheetos NOW.
72 2018-09-18 19:27:20 Beta! Ek baat yaad rakhlo aap, jo Government ko chala raha hai usne konsa economy me phd ki hain! Congress k time pe petrol price was less and increased at certain time and even the other commodities but during BJP term this price was always high! And I am suffering with it!
73 2018-09-18 19:23:07 But you support free trade deals if they're done with the EU. You don't seem to understand that it is unfettered capitalism, the fetishisation of markets and unregulated production of commodities, that is driving the collapse of the liveable planet.
74 2018-09-18 19:22:34 Prices of all basic commodities doubled since u took over . Trillions of debt and corruption. Your presidency is nothing but a pain to kenyans.
75 2018-09-18 19:21:04 5.5 seconds? Plenty quick for most people. Plus it's backed by VW. They already have a dealer / distribution network. They are also putting a charging network together with Ford.   It's Mac vs PC all over again. Both EV and autonomous driving will be commodities.
76 2018-09-18 19:20:20 Olusegun Obasanjo. From the Telecom (pan Africa policy), to commodities- Dangote et all.
77 2018-09-18 19:16:25 In your @Medium post, you're on point: people > technology. @msexcel didn't put accountants out of business. Today, spreadsheets are free; technologies become commodities. Human value continues to grow as we learn more about ourselves. #empathy
78 2018-09-18 19:09:46 I hope post rev it’s less about “superfluous” commodities and more “you can have this specific BHA and it’s free and a dermatologist is helping you pick it out” or “there are 100 shades of this sparkly lipstick bc we have no profit motive so who cares how popular each shade is”
79 2018-09-18 19:05:05 the page itself is heavy with ads for other commodities, based on readers' past web searches; and every tweet of it is an ad for twitter! whose revenues are from advertising! IT'S AN INFINITE AD LOOP. But but but 21st-century canon, why aren't the writers I like on the list? LOL

81 2018-09-18 18:59:08 As NASA supporter and voter i support taxes on all basic commodities including fuel. In fact govt shld tax more and more.
82 2018-09-18 18:55:42 Salt and matches are the cheapest commodities in the world.
83 2018-09-18 18:53:05 Soybean prices, like most commodities, fluctuate a lot but haven't risen much in decades. Imagine being paid the same price for your product as you were 40 years ago.
84 2018-09-18 18:50:48 Nai iss mn Past, presnt ki baat nai. Citizens pay several kinds of taxes on commodities and goods. But, that eaten up by corruption. FBR to contractors.

90 2018-09-18 18:26:20 Bcoz the rise in price increases the rise in transportation which then increases the price of essential as well as other commodities there by pinching the common man..
91 2018-09-18 18:21:23 Porque las mismas razones que BHP, Rio Tinto, Teck, Gleencore se mantienen enfocados en la explotación de commodities.
Crear productos con valor agregado es un rubro totalmente diferente, y seguro no serían competitivos. 
Es más fácil que surjan otras empresas dedicadas a eso
92 2018-09-18 18:20:45 Masha ALLAH good going and you forgot to mention Gas , electricity and CNG these are also commodities used by elite.....
93 2018-09-18 18:17:53 When that happens, commodities & PMs will b a target for portfolio rebalancing, as will be EM's (which currently show, even now, show projected 4%+ annual real return over a 7 year horizon....while US stocks and corporate bonds have negative annual projected returns now).

95 2018-09-18 18:10:16 @ryankalt Hi Ryan, I am an investor in Clean Commodities. I own 140,000 shares. I read about you having controlling share of the organization. What are your targets for the share price in a year from now?
96 2018-09-18 18:09:01 I heard someone say 

"I support Uhuru's 8% VAT proposal, we are ready to pay but I also ask him to lower cost of basic commodities"

I simply walked away.
97 2018-09-18 18:08:29 Drugs do not relax you, they reinforce your violent addiction to capitalist commodities.
98 2018-09-18 18:07:02 The new tax proposals are a polite way of implementing double taxation . we are going to more on all basic services and commodities. This is unacceptable @MarkMasai @ntvkenya
99 2018-09-18 18:03:17 It has less to do with their weight, and more to do with their knowledge that commodities can't go to zero.  The lower a commodity goes, the more you want to own.
100 2018-09-18 18:00:02 Commodities: Lean Hogs +4.69%, Lumber -4.13%
101 2018-09-18 17:56:47 I understand them. Whenever I see prices of commodities up I feel a hatred for Zanu. I could do the same if it was me
102 2018-09-18 17:56:04 How do you decide when to start building up a long position? Not talking specifically on btc. If you were to trade regular commodities like Uranium for example
103 2018-09-18 17:48:00 Todo país desenvolvido é industrializado. O que será feito pela "falida" indústria brasileira? Não podemos viver só de commodities #pergunteaojoão
104 2018-09-18 17:42:51 Don't make stupid calculation. Petrol/ Deisel are the factors of price hike of all commodities. Not just like petrol alone hiked. And remember you make this foolish calculation and donkey becomes pm. Now it's time to make the lion back to the seat.
105 2018-09-18 17:42:24 Prices of commodities must go up !  VAT is a consumption tax and must be passed in to the consumer ! Prosecute and recover looted cash especially from men closest to you !
106 2018-09-18 17:39:40 Business is booming along the Ethio#Eritrean border.

No tariff or taxes are currently  being imposed. 
@hawelti
107 2018-09-18 17:35:11 No..other commodities like steel and aluminium goes for years(3,4,5,6,etc) once the bull tun started..
108 2018-09-18 17:28:46 Are you beginning to control prices for commodities and services? Kenyans would be anxious to know that the principle of free market forces apply  online more. Start with recommendations on fares and come to issue recommended retail prices for basic goods and services
109 2018-09-18 17:25:06 Mr....wbu other commodities only u see petrol ka price 
110 2018-09-18 17:23:30 I suspect if they don't take action in next few months it can be big negative to Modi in 2019. People don't understand economics they want someone who can control fuel prices & other commodities prices.
Interesting to see how Modi will respond to this.

114 2018-09-18 17:16:29 You talk about migrants like they are commodities, to choose to have when it suits and dispose when they are inconvenient. We have always had control but didn’t use the laws to send home people not contributing. Long term I am more concerned about immigration from outside the EU.
115 2018-09-18 17:14:13 Imagine being that engrossed in violence that you are willing to watch your precious commodities die to satisfy your blood lust. Slave masters used to breed male bucks to fight eachother to the death the same way people now do with dogs and chickens.
116 2018-09-18 17:10:06 If you have not figured out the US Treasury, Federal Reserve, BIS game of pumping up stocks & bonds by buying them w counterfeited money & holding down commodities by selling them short using counterfeited money & HFT then you ARE NOT A VERY STABLE GENIUS. @EconguyRosie @nntaleb

119 2018-09-18 17:04:11 true commodities rally late in economic cycles .. just wondering if this cycle's end is being accelerated by tariff wars and its effects on emerging markets ..
120 2018-09-18 17:02:17 Crescimento de curto prazo se terá com corte de gastos e bloqueio da Corrupção. A médio e longo prazo, tornar nossas empresas e commodities mais competitivas para o Mercado Externo. #Bolsonaro #EleSim
121 2018-09-18 17:00:56 Right, so I get what you’re saying

You’re saying it’s not like the players don’t get anything from the relationship & I agree the players do

That doesn’t mean that the club don’t see them as commodities
122 2018-09-18 16:58:10 I know you dont think they are commodities, but you made it sound like the club only treats them like securities in a portfolio.
123 2018-09-18 16:57:03 makes me curious 

1. You still need the cash to exercise those warrants there not free

2.  You invest in commodities yet see no upside?

125 2018-09-18 16:51:53 "Singapore is wealthy — 
yet it is a small nation with little in the sense of raw materials.

Japan has few commodities and minerals and yet, 
they are richer now through trade
than they are when they tried to take by force."

126 2018-09-18 16:48:31 @eenadulivenews @ennadu_english andhra paradesh govt reduce or cancel GST on export commodities for state Vikash ?
127 2018-09-18 16:45:46 Fed holding special seminar on how to prop up stocks & bonds while crushing commodities with HFT, collusion, deep capture. You should go, it's kind of a financial #WolfowitzDoctrine for the USD & Banks.
128 2018-09-18 16:43:16 For the human commodities, you are your record, like an entry in a slave inventory or a machine’s maintenance history. Your next buyer needs to see your defect history. You need to accept that you are your Carfax and work on upgrades to raise your marketable value
129 2018-09-18 16:41:53 Support means ensuring nostro payments are guaranteed for certain exports on sector. It's how fuel & power is currently paid for under the Afrexim export incentive. Being the UK it's likely to be horticulture and commodities. Zim will have to use UK supply chain as a condition.
130 2018-09-18 16:39:50 Do you feel like what I said feels like I think they're commodities
131 2018-09-18 16:38:47 Facts:

BTC is a commodity.

Most commodities have traded below cost of production at one point.

Therefore, the argument that BTC's price will never fall below mining cost is completely absurd.

It's a false narrative that has infected crypto and will lead people off a cliff.
132 2018-09-18 16:36:12 Sometimes this makes the players seem like commodities. They are humans who have to agree with every step of the process as well. 

It benefits them, the small clubs, and if the player is good enough, benefits us too.

Maybe bringing back B teams would help.
133 2018-09-18 16:31:48 YOU are the one targeting farmers. You bail them out and impose yet another round of tariffs. You and Xi seem like two schoolyard bullies. Which bully will prevail? Meantime, commodities are higher for consumers here. Example of WINNING? Nah. Just your blustering and bullying.
134 2018-09-18 16:28:53 Its extremely simple. Assert that "trust" has value by the consumers of that "trust". Value comes from commodities that consumers consumes. Commodities are produced entrepreneurs by allocating resources, thus accruing risk. Risk has a cost.
135 2018-09-18 16:23:29 Yeah, it’s tragic and unfair. Westeros is essentially a hellscape for women. 

Which brings me back to the original point: Hoster Tully wasn’t so great. He used his daughters as commodities and fucked with Lysa’s bodily autonomy. Fuck that guy.
136 2018-09-18 16:22:45 @narendramodi 
Day by day fuel prices are increasing, due to this increasing the prices of essential commodities are gone up.
Hence I request our honourable prime minister to look this matter and do the needful.

With regards,
M.Kalyana Sundaram
137 2018-09-18 16:19:26 Money is still money. US and KSA are tied together by the ball-sack. More about assets in a broader sense, rather than just commodities, and one commodity in particular.
138 2018-09-18 16:13:03 Uday ji I beg to  differ
The single grtst attrib about ecnmy is its ability to maintain a strng curr & pricing power for the commodities it exports
We HAVE FAILED MISERABLY ON THIS FRONT
COMP FOR A MOMENT WITH  SMALL Countries like THAILAND or UAE  and u will see the light I hope
139 2018-09-18 16:12:35 The American entertainment industry is rarely recognized for its contribution to the idea of the 'American dream.' That dream is in great part mirage, created by the film and music industries. They're commodities. They've done untold amounts of positive PR for this nation.
140 2018-09-18 16:10:40 Basic Income allows citizens to purchase health promoting commodities not provided by the state, importantly reduces stigma associated with poverty #GCPHSem15
141 2018-09-18 16:09:52 Just 1 of 100s (1000s) ways that we directly or indirectly pillage the world economically and militarily. If our "leaders" held the values that we preach, fair prices would be paid for these commodities and there'd be better conditions. Flooding 3rd world markets with...
142 2018-09-18 16:02:57 Walking around Stratford Shopping Centre

which I get to see unsold in stores all over the World 

truly is a wonderful reflection of Capitalism at its most perverse.
143 2018-09-18 15:58:08 If the CON gress wins,your salary will have to grow , as Inflation will skyrocket again and go back to the double digit inflation of the UPA-1, UPA-2 and the pre-Janata Party CON gress governments . All Commodities will cost more - and Consumer price index will soar.......
144 2018-09-18 15:57:44 Canada has two advantages. Commodities and talent. Commodities, we need to ensure capacity to export.  Talent, create environment to stay and reasons to come back. Lower income/corp taxes, raise VAT. Allow talent to free flow as if no boarders.
145 2018-09-18 15:52:25 Why dont you tell you followers that In 2025 China plans to export but take in no commodities . I guess you'll just stick with the Trump is bad narrative.
146 2018-09-18 15:51:22 4 of the top 5 all seem to have something in common. Maybe building budgets off of highly volatile commodities aren’t the best idea!
147 2018-09-18 15:50:30 Buy real things hopefully with a return, like property, businesses, durable commodities at or below cost of production.
148 2018-09-18 15:47:46 Don't you think, Dustin, that warning signs, such as his alleged mistreatment of and attitudes towards women can be overlooked by an individual who has treated women as commodities all of his life?
149 2018-09-18 15:44:40 That’s exactly it. It’s easy to say “Commute further”, but completely ignores the realities of the effect it has. A perfect example of people being treated as commodities by a broken system.

152 2018-09-18 15:37:56 The articles list  practical ways why currency pair down and commodities price up. It's got nothing to do with theories. Your generic swipe 'Oh, EVERYTHING is bad' rhetoric is as good as a 5th grader's point of view. Can you be a little more specific?

154 2018-09-18 15:33:43 This is bullshit. we want 0% VAT on basic commodities. If you take the proceeds of corruption from individuals like Rutto u use the money on several productive areas of the economy without increasing taxes.
155 2018-09-18 15:33:10 Namely, a negative aspect of urbanity produces scarcity as it serves as a focus of commodities. This seem contradictory until one realizes that commodity entering the city is often matched by people coming as well for many reasons beyond that required for urban function. ...
156 2018-09-18 15:32:04 Agreed. 
Just had my stock algorithm writing son take a look at cash soybeans monthly (long-term) chart & ask him his opinion. 
He doesn't follow commodities much yet so his opinion was unbiased by my bearishness. He took one look at the chart and saw next support in the $5 area.

In Nigeria, we need a  government that can control the prices of our commodities, price control will do a lot in stabilizing the livelihood of Nigerian people.
162 2018-09-18 15:14:25 I don’t think it’s a great excuse considering what Asad Umer used to say about hikes in gas and fuel prices. It’s in the air that prices of several commodities are being raised. Is it Tabdeeli?

164 2018-09-18 15:12:00 The more I think about it the more I'm not bothered by it. Why dump an asset at what was possibly a low price when the commodities it represents are only going higher and is a potential near term producer.

177 2018-09-18 14:29:17 US vs China tradewar seems weird 'cause US doesn't really have anything that China needs but China has commodities that US wants. Feels like the pressure Trump is trying to lay on China is going to backfire.

Tho this is my simplistic view of the whole deal.
178 2018-09-18 14:25:05 Commodities have value. An ear of corn is worth one ear of corn, one liter of water is worth one liter of water. Currency allows us to create the ability to create comparative values between unlike objects, nothing more and nothing less. Bitcoin is the most efficient at this

181 2018-09-18 14:18:23 Bayer said on Tuesday it would be difficult to predict 2019 earnings at its agriculture business, which now includes Monsanto, because a U.S.-Chinese trade dispute could reroute global trade flows in farming commodities.
182 2018-09-18 14:13:50 Where it is isn't, miners will turn off their servers and fewer coins will be produced - providing support to the price. Bitcoin should behave like other commodities in that respect (though unlike the others it has little value in use)
183 2018-09-18 14:12:40 Bayer said on Tuesday it would be difficult to predict 2019 earnings at its agriculture business, which now includes Monsanto, because a U.S.-Chinese trade dispute could reroute global trade flows in farming commodities.

If you are, best you check grain/ commodities prices and compare them to before the village idiot's #TradeWars.  If you're good with that then you've named yourself well.
186 2018-09-18 14:05:38 “Mining costs” will have absolutely nothing to do with where BTC will bottom. 

There are many many commodities that have traded below cost at one point or another.
187 2018-09-18 14:05:30 If you know so much why do you just keep saying it's good rather than offering specifics? Why ignore where I agree that global trade of ideas is beneficial. Why pretend that the carbon balance of global trade of goods and commodities is not dangerous?
188 2018-09-18 14:04:28 "Economics has a useful past (...). Many useful commodities and services are not produced in a society because they are worth less than they cost: it
remains the unfulfilled task of the historians of economics to show
that their subject is worth its cost." George Stigler (1969)

191 2018-09-18 13:54:41 I really do not know where our Prices of Essential Commodities are going.. With lot of fan fare Modi got Elected. He has let down Indians.
192 2018-09-18 13:51:56 @HonAdenDuale you are so stupid but i don't blame rather i blame your godfather @UKenyatta and @WilliamsRuto who have made you their mouthpiece in the looting spree of kenyans and that's why you think VAT on fuel will not affect other commodities.
193 2018-09-18 13:51:24 God is working 24/7 too. I truly believe prosperity is eminent. I deal in commodities and I can empathize but I believe in removing tariffs equilaterally - I truly believe China will destroy USA otherwise. They force us to make adjustments to their benefit
194 2018-09-18 13:48:03 Good that I don't need to transfer..  u trade in commodities as well ??
195 2018-09-18 13:46:50 El problema tenemos una estructura económica igual a la de Venezuela que depende de las fluctuaciones del precio del petróleo y otros commodities. Los programas sociales han empobrecido al país necesitamos  política de estado en materia de desarrollo y crecimiento hasta el 2050.
196 2018-09-18 13:46:35 #TrumpIsAMoron His ego-driven trade war with China has been crippling family farmers. The commodities markets have tanked since Trump started pretending he knew anything about global trade. Remember, Trump is a failed businessman, his companies have gone bankrupt multiple times.
197 2018-09-18 13:41:59 Simple. Celebrities are viewed as commodities. In the view of some, they don't own their sexuality. We do. Some truly gross people genuinely believe that celebrities don't even have a right to privacy. The very existence of the paparazzi shows that.

203 2018-09-18 13:32:17 Im now mainly worried about the inflation of the basic commodities & devaluation of our surrogate currency. Looks like we headed back to 2008 situation . However this is in line with the prophesies & i hope our time comes quickly .

205 2018-09-18 13:26:40 sad and so infuriating to watch this... farmers see them as commodities and not the living sentient beings they are... 
206 2018-09-18 13:18:28 When will the dolt economists at @ThePrintIndia would write an article as to how Modi Govt is able to hold the prices of commodities in spite of rise in oil prices @ShekharGupta ?
207 2018-09-18 13:11:17 And an easier option for China too. Can force firms -something US can’t do- to buy more commodities, oil etc. They could even re-sell it and bilateral deficit would decline. It doesn’t, however, tackle any of the core issues. But neither a trade war
208 2018-09-18 13:10:29 Modiji bewkoof ministers says that government has no control of petrol and diesel prices. It is international market. The bjp ministers says that government is helpless in dollar price. BJP minister say that government has no control on high price of essential commodities.
209 2018-09-18 13:09:35 The tariffs are a tax on my primary commodities. When steel companies have to pay a tariff they have to pass it on to their customers. As a customer I have to cover that tax. Yes, I can pass it on, but these increases cause delays and lulls. Those impact small companies hard.

228 2018-09-18 12:17:34 There are no "Holy Grails" when you factor in the human element. You will make mistakes in judgment. However, if you're toying with several trading ideas...my advice is for you to pick one out of the several and perfect it. #Commodities #Trader Don't be a jack of all trades...
229 2018-09-18 12:10:01 Yeah. Why don’t we swing you around next year. I lighten up when people like you stop justifying treating living creatures like commodities.
230 2018-09-18 12:08:08 Spot on Emma. These two groups should never be grouped as a commodities “for profit” Its the downfall of our society.
231 2018-09-18 12:06:21 The cages were Obama solution. The border facilities are run by real people doing a good job with children who are commodities in human traffic.
232 2018-09-18 11:55:14 It's wrong to make 1000% profit on one commodity or item which is what u are insinuating , no business runs that way. You can distribute your profit amongst various commodities but to have, 1000% profit mark up on one item or per item? Who ever does that should go back to school
233 2018-09-18 11:52:34 The common mwananchi has never woken up looking for a housing solution from the govt. I wonder in who's benefit this is being done. What people need are better services like Universal Health Care, affordable commodities, safe and secure environments. Not housing.

237 2018-09-18 11:43:08 The opportunity cost of me dating this girl A, is that I give up the opportunity to date that girl B. If I spend my afternoon at the cinema, I lose the opportunity to spend that time painting art. If I buy this big ass TV, I can’t use that money to trade commodities.
238 2018-09-18 11:39:33 Our Economy* isn’t dependent on China, but the inflated equity markets are. 
Autos, Semis, Commodities, oil & gas, the whole thing will be down when they roll hard. 
IMO we are going to collapse either way but don’t be stupid and think we can knock them down and not our markets.
239 2018-09-18 11:33:19 El progreso se dio más que nada por los commodities, estamos supeditados a la variación de los precios de los metales. La bicameralidad propuesta está enmarcado dentro del bicameralismo imperfecto con diferencia de funciones en cada cámara que es diferente al simétrico de los 80s
240 2018-09-18 11:29:16 Mar even inserted "Repeal TRAIN as it pertains to fuel and other basic commodities" in his suggestions to solve the rice crises. What does that have to do with it? How does removing the TRAIN fix the problem? Will it stop the rice traders from hoarding and jacking up rice prices?
241 2018-09-18 11:17:38 Que las empresas que exportan commodities, destinen un Diezmo de lo exportado a invertir, en sociedad con emprendedores, en empresas que agreguen valor al commodities que exportan.

245 2018-09-18 11:03:07 It's ODM and not NASA who are supporting @UKenyatta's  Memorandum to have fuel increased by 8% that will cause other basic commodities to escalate .The same group of people are the ones who traded with our lives in the name of DEMONSTRATIONS. #ISupportUhuruCuts

249 2018-09-18 10:44:36 In Kenya, once the prices of commodities go up, they never come down coz the businessman will be exhausting "old stock" and also factor inflation. NASA and jubilee politicians are in bed together. Kenyans are on their own.
250 2018-09-18 10:41:28 The current FX subsidies on basic commodities are depleting fast. Its wiser for the gvt to gradually withdraw them to allow prices to creep up. We did it b4. It never works! Even in Venezuela!

And it's not wise either to borrow $250mil offshore to subsidise  consumer goods.

257 2018-09-18 10:20:57 PM Modi has proved that the rise in prices of essential commodities have nothing to do with rise in oil prices. Lootyens media used to teach us this nonsense during UPA time.
258 2018-09-18 10:14:23 So soon the price increase will cause critical shortages of most basic commodities
259 2018-09-18 10:13:55 It used to be a norm for media to suggest rise in prices of essential commodities as and when oil prices are increased during UPA time. But one doesn't hear such fear nowadays. Even the home makers are not complaining about rising prices.

263 2018-09-18 10:07:27 Isn’t it surprising that all opposition members who are making hue and cry over fuel price rise same want price rise for essential commodities like vegetables and milk. Are opposition members living on petrol and diesel?
264 2018-09-18 10:06:19 Commodities are the opium of the people.

283 2018-09-18 08:54:40 Politicians want to make economic decisions,meanwhile Economists want to tell us the fact that th price of commodities is rising means we're running out of natural resources. Y can't yall make judgements in yo field of expertise?

287 2018-09-18 08:26:49 já pensei em estudar agricultura na Holanda aka o país onde o setor primário é mais produtivo e viver de commodities que vão aumentar de preço com o aquecimento global + crescimento populacional + explosão da classe média asiática
288 2018-09-18 08:21:43 That’s it sorted then. Maybe the key is in your use of the term “commodity” in reference to housing & rents. Think you should have said “commodities” but what’s a detail when you’re setting the world to rights while sponging off the taxpayers you’re so concerned about. #CBLive
289 2018-09-18 08:19:25 Hi, like many other companies, we have taken this step because of rising costs including commodities. However, we still believe that our tubs represent excellent value for money.The reduction in size means that we can avoid raising the price despite rising production costs
290 2018-09-18 08:15:51 It's always hard when one part of your season is a challenge, but when the whole season works against you it makes you realise. Sadly it's us that carry the risk and consumers are so oblivious to the fickle nature of such necessary commodities to life. Well explained!

295 2018-09-18 07:33:00 Por 10 anos tivemos a faca e o queijo na mão e nenhuma reforma estrutural foi feita. O boom das commodities deu imensa margem de manobra ao governo Lula para mediar os conflitos de interesse da nossa elite predatória e torramos tudo com ganhos de consumo que o Temer reverteu.
296 2018-09-18 07:24:51 Dedé, o PT governou durante o maior superciclo de commodities da história moderna e entregou pouco. Foi só o boom cessar que nós vimos o governo Dilma entegar a pior recessão da história brasileira, isso tudo num biênio em que a LATAM terminou com PIB positivo.
297 2018-09-18 07:22:14 yea I know.. but it was because of that that we have higher prices on basic commodities

305 2018-09-18 06:14:44 I don't support this #ISupportUhuruCuts campaigns. Charging 8% VAT on petroleum products in essence increases the cost of every other commodity whose production and/or supply is affected by petroleum products. I would rather they tax us highly on other commodities.

341 2018-09-18 03:32:16 The sale of secondary commodities have a history of turbulence that to resolve needs a fully integrated set of policies & market interventions (minimum recycled content for one) These are essential to deliver the required balance of push & pull policies to support markets & sales

346 2018-09-18 03:07:04 Oil markets dropped as the latest escalation in the Sino-U.S. trade war clouded the outlook for demand, although concerns over tightening supply offered prices some support.

347 2018-09-18 02:57:00 Transparency,trust and honesty are interesting commodities,everyone expects and demands it yet few people are appreciative when they receive it and then become upset to find they’ve lost it.
348 2018-09-18 02:55:02 its not work if they are not producing commodities for a wage
349 2018-09-18 02:53:41 i use those as synonyms unless u think bakunin wasnt anarchist and anything short of the kropotkin-style big-pile-of-commodities-everyone-takes-from is not anarchism
350 2018-09-18 02:51:25 All their grants in the world won’t make up for this. I’m guessing it’s probably not the first. Animals are NOT commodities. Our species has done enough. My city only allows rescue groups to do adoptions. No breed of any sort is sold. It’s catching on. This didn’t have to happen!
351 2018-09-18 02:51:25 Dollar strengthens with dollar index 94.60. Commodities decline in USD terms means nothing for the world. 
JPY nearing 112 a USD....#Nikkei up 1%
352 2018-09-18 02:50:17 Sugar is the last among the commodities, to come to life. It will roar for another four years! Ethanol price hike has given strength to keep sugar price profitable to producers. Sugar is in consumption sector. Except diabetes, nothing wrong!
353 2018-09-18 02:47:21 E nenhum deles falou sobre as commodities de minério, tão importantes para a balança comercial brasileira. Assim fica difícil. 
354 2018-09-18 02:46:42 I'm not sure women & girls are much more than commodities (or accusatory inconveniences) in Kavanaugh's world-view..!
355 2018-09-18 02:43:55 Commodities can trade below production costs for extended periods. The lowest cost BTC producers may be key, near $3,000. Lower prices reduce mining competition, thus reducing costs.
356 2018-09-18 02:39:53 That is not a new idea. It was a project, a dream before oil explotation when our principal commodities, coffee and cocoa were exported through Maracaibo port.
357 2018-09-18 02:38:39 Dear Mr. President, 
As a farmer, I’m asking you to open a dialog of constructive negotiations with China.  You are killing our export markets.  Food commodities should not be used as leverage in foreign trade policies. Our continued support for your politics is in jeopardy.  -GN
358 2018-09-18 02:36:31 Everything and everybody are merely commodities.
359 2018-09-18 02:36:03 Just the other day it was due to low global demand for commodities. #strarcom hatchet job. *yawn*

 será que alguém dos economistas falará sobre as commodities minerais que detém acentuado peso na balança comercial?
361 2018-09-18 01:58:39 No problem man. All about trading psychology based off a CME commodities futures bull run trader story
362 2018-09-18 01:58:34 I normally don't affirm the corporate tradition of putting out festive commodities over a month in advance of their respective holidays, but my grocery store was already selling Count Chocula. What was a gamer to do?
363 2018-09-18 01:51:23 @narendramodi the trading of commodities below low price on NCDEX should be banned.this will effectively work in clearing the stock of government
364 2018-09-18 01:46:33 ...extremely distressing sight...great disparity in legal provisions so called 'farm animals', compared to companion animals...speciesism, of course...they are property, 'commodities', dispensable in the greater scheme of preserving 'life'...@EstherThePig @HSIGlobal @peta

366 2018-09-18 01:38:32 Ciro Gomes, há muito tempo é dito que o Brasil é um país que se sustenta por commodities. Como transformar o Brasil em um produtor de tecnologia e qual a importância disso para um país como o nosso? #PergunteaoCiro12 #VamoCiro
367 2018-09-18 01:37:10 @AmitShah all commodities banned in NCDEX which are trading on below MSP.Then market should be stable and the stock of govt. Is also clearled
368 2018-09-18 01:35:41 So just how cheap do our commodities need to get for countries to buy our stuff
369 2018-09-18 01:35:22 Perhaps not forgotten but rather prioritising other commodities that are the current “flavours of the month”.

371 2018-09-18 01:30:02 #Gold and #silver, like other #commodities, have an intrinsic value, which is not arbitrary, but is dependent on their scarcity.
372 2018-09-18 01:27:02 How low did your taxes go ? When prices for commodities went up what did you win?
373 2018-09-18 01:18:53 I just hope you are able to sit back and chuckle at the American Jack Ass in power. I believe Canada could benefit greatly for technology replacing fossil fuel thinking. His tariff threats means,(to me) less people invest in commodities like cars. CARS his own people manufacture.
374 2018-09-18 01:17:52 Farmers, production/processing and coffee board to be blame.. 

Coffee is traded like oil and other commodities. With a futures trading.. alot of contracts expiring throughout 2018/2019 seems many betted on a lower price .

376 2018-09-18 01:03:42 (2) China mostly mfgs commodity prod that are price sensitive with low profit margins. Volume is key to mfg commodities. A coffee maker made in China is priced at $100 US. Tariff of 100% may stim a US mfg to make them here at a price of $200. But tariff will need to be indefinate

378 2018-09-18 00:57:44 @Super_Crypto I don't think price suppression will happen without them owning the majority of $btc. It works in commodities & various financial instruments bc the demand doesn't exceed the supply.
379 2018-09-18 00:54:58 Last night's participants in @4corners - nursing home staff and families - were so brave and articulate in exposing a flawed system that ignores the fact its commodities are actual vulnerable humans #AgedCareRC #4corners
380 2018-09-18 00:51:22 You piqued my interest, so I took a look at coffee's charts. 
Forward curve shows a strong carry through July 2021. 
Dec contract posted a new 12-year low this month .
"Coffee will never go up." 
(Knowing full well there is no such thing as always or never in commodities.)

388 2018-09-18 00:05:59 Healthcare needs to separate into two separate areas: what are commodities and what is highly quality specific

The concept of personalized medicine has put a ton of focus on the latter. But to get better costs, we should figure out how to standardize and scale the former
