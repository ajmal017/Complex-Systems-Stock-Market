7 2018-08-21 22:33:34 @Coles @acccgovau you have made the news this morning for your massively high PETROL prices. Down down. Spare me. The Middle East is having fuel envy watching you juggle people’s wallets with essential commodities. Thank your mates @CaltexAustralia and Woolworths as well.

9 2018-08-21 22:27:32 The heavily subsidized rural states largely produce commodities, and most blue states have ports (not to mention can afford to fund transportation for their own food producers). We'd be happy to stop subsidies for y'all to use our ports to export your soybeans.

50 2018-08-21 20:02:45 The best attack against commodities used to be that they're too expensive.  But that's pretty much dead considering IAU costs 0.25% and commodities baskets like BCI go for 0.29%.
51 2018-08-21 20:01:32 The divergence right now between Tech and FAANGs vs emerging markets and  commodities is enormous. You have probably 10% max upside left in Tech and FAANGS vs 50% to 100% upside for EM's and Commodities. Not a hard choice if your investing for the next 3 to 5 years.

56 2018-08-21 19:41:30 Eso lo veremos cuando sepamos cómo van a utilizar realmente esos commodities, por lo pronto, no lo conocemos. El gobierno debe garantizar un mínimo establecido independiente a las bajas, no necesariamente (como fue hasta ahora) sustentado en las commodities.

67 2018-08-21 18:59:10 An abiding contradiction of our moment: capital wants to impose as much as work as possible because work is its form of social control, and capital wants to reduce work to increase productivity, devalue commodities, devalue labor-power, reduce costs and increase profit.
68 2018-08-21 18:49:42 on the other hand, commodities as a group is rather cheap (maybe apart from oil), I mean, look at silver, soybean, gold, sugar etc....

it is not paying dividend, generating cash flows etc. but still I would take a bet that silver will go up by at least 10% within 12 months...

76 2018-08-21 18:27:00 one of the key points in Debord's Society of the Spectacle is that the Spectacle(mechanism through which capitalism culturally retains its hold) acts as a mediator in the exchange of commodities. It becomes the medium through which all items of value are compared.

83 2018-08-21 18:08:47 Agreed — in part, the gold China seeks to accumulate and has been accumulating for years is to peg the Yuan to gold and undermine the U.S. dollar/petrodollar as the #1 reserve currency in the world. In some cases, happening as we speak in commodities trade deals i.e. oil

107 2018-08-21 17:01:49 Rehypothecation isn't inherently bad. If you borrow, you either sell to get short or are paying interest. There is a mechanical limit to it. 

Also I think naked shorting commodities is very difficult when basis risk is intractable, such as with a globally traded arb'ed asset.

117 2018-08-21 16:26:54 @Walker_Albert pointed out that all the lot worker supply of untaxed commodities intended for Curve will all be dumped at Lockn at buyers' prices, they should be advertising that
118 2018-08-21 16:25:24 I certainly hope they do! Maybe some macro guys can give their input. What I am observing is that commodities are falling in response to a stronger dollar but u308 is not... Imo its because u308 is at rock bottom prices and s/d pushing price up...1/x

126 2018-08-21 16:04:05 Sadly, many animal breeders look at their animals as commodities rather than individual life forms. They only see the cash to be made, not the harm they're inflicting on the animals. They're a heartless lot, really.

128 2018-08-21 15:57:05 Fora que para o país a conta não fecha. O Brasil só exporta commodities, e importa mercadoria de valor agregado. O volume que exportamos é grande mas o valor é pequeno considerando o montante que importamos.
129 2018-08-21 15:57:00 Jajajaja. Gracioso. No fue el peronismo fumándose los ingresos de los commodities? Mira qué raro. Ahora le aviso a todos los historiadores y economistas. 3 de Perón 2 de Menem y 3 de los K pero nos jodió la derecha?

131 2018-08-21 15:51:11 That's whether they are *classified* as a security by regulatory bodies, not whether people are *treating* them as de facto securities; but it seems like maybe it would be more accurate to say that they are *commodities* and commodities lost the battle to be currency long ago.
132 2018-08-21 15:50:43 Papo furado! Ficaram 13 anos mamando nas tetas, só fizeram politicagem e se beneficiaram com a valorização das commodities.

136 2018-08-21 15:35:41 We are talking about "increase in cost" not pounds and naira. Prices of commodities usually increases in an economy with a high inflation. How is this difficult to understand?

170 2018-08-21 13:38:18 Exatamente! O Lula surfou no fenomenal crescimento chines, e por consequência das commodities, durante seu primeiro mandato. Com a popularidade que tinha, poderia ter feito reformas estruturantes, que até hoje precisamos. Mas não fez nada! Sofremos hoje pelo que ele plantou.
171 2018-08-21 13:36:01 Commodities and commodity countries like Brazil super weak - but how long before that changes. China also getting cheap.
172 2018-08-21 13:34:56 No it's 10billion jobs, i may not be a super fan of PDP but the difference is not comparable Shiite Muslim massacred, IPOB massacred, Benue and platue state massacred prices of essential commodities sky rocketed! Lies and lies upon lies so much promises unkept!
173 2018-08-21 13:32:28 Yes, this should’ve have been the approach. But, unfortunately there was no transparency and this led to protests, riots and deaths. Rationalism and common-sense are the two most uncommon commodities in today world. Again, unfortunate but sadly the reality!
174 2018-08-21 13:22:46 Joe said this morning on MorningJoe how well economy is doing for Joes friends back in his home state of Florida.
Joe, for MANY of US in the Midwest states that rely on selling commodities like Soy Bean, Pork, Beef, Chicken etc etc etc it is not going so well.
And we blame Trump!

178 2018-08-21 13:08:45 They should be. They’re not commodities. You need to earn them and maintain credibility to hold them.
179 2018-08-21 13:00:13 How did this all get so vile? 
Does it trace back to greed? 
Or the lust for power & the
capitalistic commodities that
props up a frail wall street? 
Why is it all so ugly & hidden? 
At our (the peoples) expense. 
We need to keep money and
religion out of our politics.
180 2018-08-21 12:54:37 What you think about extreme efficiency in allocating resources? Which seems (to me) to be a feasible feature of AI driven capitalism. Extreme efficiency should drive down costs and through competition lower margins at a point where most important goods became commodities

188 2018-08-21 12:06:30 This kid is extremely obnoxious and his remarks seem to have a theme regarding the uselessness of the older generation.  Funny thing is I think that wisdom and common sense in the younger generation are scares commodities. Life experience often teaches us life lessons.
189 2018-08-21 12:03:12 Record exports as an EU member.

Even greater record imports as the costs of materials and commodities to make those exports shot up in value due to the weak pound.

192 2018-08-21 11:29:39 Yep. Agree. Companies which r mostly in commodities gain & suffer from this earnings leverage most! Companies with strong brands fair relatively better, but you never know really, whether the earning momentum will ever return to them even again. Sometimes even they just die out!
193 2018-08-21 11:27:08 O latino-americano médio vota em pessoas, e não em propostas. A ligação é invariavelmente sentimental e irracional. Lula tem a história do nordestino lutador e remete à bonança das commodities dos anos 2000, sem que se pense nas razões ou se isso agora é passível de repetição.
194 2018-08-21 11:26:10 Agree, however the big issue is that a re-evaluation of anything requires time, foresight, and strategy - commodities in very short supply at the moment.
195 2018-08-21 11:22:43 AUD is a proxy for commodities...if metals are strong AUD will be strong.
196 2018-08-21 11:20:55 Yes, women are finding their way 2 being indipendent (free from men) cultural actors & it takes time & produces overreactions 2 change a culture which has dominated them & used them as commodities for 3-5 millenia. Culture is a complex matter, so let's not be too judgemental
197 2018-08-21 11:14:00 The interesting thing is that most commodities, and even money itself, seems absurd when you book it down to base elements.

224 2018-08-21 07:56:44 Saya jelaskan ya kpd anda yg bukan pelaku pasar dan ga ngerti ekonomi. Situasi ekonomi Indonesia sangat dipengaruhi kondisi global. Waktu SBY jabat kondisi ekonomi global bullish. Apa aja jd duit dan dia menikmati commodities boom. Di jaman jokowi genjot infrastruktur,
225 2018-08-21 07:44:04 European shares steadied in early trading on Tuesday as caution settled in before trade talks between the United States and China later in the week, though a weaker dollar boosted shares in international earners and commodities sectors.

229 2018-08-21 07:22:05 There are capital projects remember the gvt has quite a broad mandate. Funding and financing all public institutes subsidising other commodities infrastructure and paying back the borrowed monies
230 2018-08-21 07:21:55 A gucci-clad pimp who sees players as commodities is defining the term Leader. 

Exhausted the millions United paid you for Pogba? Why try to sell him to City / Barca / Juve.

Please take away your client who wants to increase his salary without contributing anything to the club
231 2018-08-21 07:19:35 Hmm..tarrifs affect the price globally traded commodities for example iron ore. It's a demand supply question on the open market that sets the price. That's why unilateral tarrifs make little sense.
232 2018-08-21 07:17:18 BHP Billiton underlying profits rise 33% on commodities price growth. But the FY earnings came up short vs. analyst expectations.

234 2018-08-21 07:10:46 I bloody love #crypto been trading this 1 low cap for months and consistently banking profits 20% 50% 100% every few weeks (see earlier tweets). Just don't get these opportunities in commodities or property

236 2018-08-21 06:58:58 Factory-workers demand for a pay rise is justified, given the rise in the price of commodities - food, transport, accommodation, etc But his has to be within the confines of the law and respect others' rights. For them to stone innocent people's vehicles leaves much to be desired
237 2018-08-21 06:57:10 Try being a business that imports commodities. The cost has rocketed since the day after the vote.
238 2018-08-21 06:49:46 Why are we exporting all our assets and not being able to use them ourselves. We export gas and coal for nothing and have the most expensive commodities.
239 2018-08-21 06:45:36 "He said he now felt that he had wasted 10 months of his life trying to play the markets."

Kinda same as with trying to play forex markets, commodities or anything else where also big market makers roam.

Many people would be better off buying and playing a market sim game.

241 2018-08-21 06:29:06 You should look up PUAs of the world. Pussy is easy to come by. Sex is easy. Are you inferring that the women attached to it are all commodities and blessings?

243 2018-08-21 06:16:50 I played this for hours. It also taught you about the commodities Canada produces. I don’t know how else I’d know that Canada was a leading producer of tungsten which is used in lightbulb filaments.

247 2018-08-21 05:53:20 No matter how much you advocate for mental health, it will always end in futility. Long as we live in a capitalist society where people are treated as commodities, long as we have an education system that is commercialized,  mental health issues will always be prevalent.
248 2018-08-21 05:52:34 A China comunista cresce 6,9% esse ano. O Vietnã comunista também cresce 7%. E o Brasil liberal? 1%. Qual o plano econômico do Jair Bolsonaro? Pelo que eu li no plano de governo dele é aumentar ainda mais a nossa dependência das commodities. Sem desenvolver a indústria local.

250 2018-08-21 05:48:25 I mean, I LOVE boobs, but not as much as I hate using women’s bodies as functioning commodities.
251 2018-08-21 05:37:20 Or, when you do the right thing and treat people like people instead of commodities, attention comes. Which is kinda sad because that should be the standard of a consumer based business anyway lol
252 2018-08-21 05:30:16 @realDonaldTrump The cost of producing rural commodities is fast outpacing the return seen for our goods. This leads to reduced food security in the US. Agriculture is the back bone of America, our productivity affects ALL Americans 3 times a day, this cause is great PR!!!!!!
253 2018-08-21 05:26:42 Talk, why don’t we?Commodities tried to turn the corner on reports of low-level talks about a framework to end the trade war and this made everyone realize that perhaps some of the fears of the backlash from a trade war were overblown. China is feeling the pain of the tr...
254 2018-08-21 05:21:22 then starts the race to turn signaling goods into commodities
255 2018-08-21 05:20:12 And the deficit is exploding, commodities prices down due to tariffs, and inflation is up.
256 2018-08-21 05:12:22 Ol'Bob sez...Actors & Actresses are disposable commodities in Hollywood where they build you up and when your no longer a moneymaker they dump you, just ask Jim Carrey or Alyssa Milano, Celebrity has been and no one really cares what they have to say or think anymore!!!!

258 2018-08-21 05:02:56 Lisa go ahead and fuck yourself. Why should a minimum wage NOT be a livable wage. Why should someone work full time and STILL not be able to afford basic commodities and services? Or is it that they just aren’t yanking on those bootstrap hard enough?

260 2018-08-21 04:49:47 #Commodities  During the past few years, the Commitment of Traders (COT) data has become increasingly unreliable.  Why?  Because everyone now follows the COT data.  Therefore, it no longer works as a contrarian indicator. #Contrarian
261 2018-08-21 04:14:10 Apart from the oil price surge and the on-going trade war between China and the US is the factor of having selfish businessmen manipulate the prices of commodities in times of crisis.

Hoarders and Speculators, not the farmers, are to blame in the series of food price increases.
262 2018-08-21 04:09:12 @CyrilRamaphosa with all due respect.. From R11.50 against the dollar to R15.42, thats almost R4, +-30% of R11.50..everything is rising except income, its declining,commodities (Gold) market down by almost $200,won't mining company cut jobs to keep profits stable?
263 2018-08-21 04:05:48 Our government doesn't set our commodities prices for what we contract and sell overseas. A main point of the program is to have access to say barley, malt and then brew it and create a report so that malt barley buyers in say Japan know what to expect from this years crop
264 2018-08-21 04:04:12 mmay3r Turn luxuries into commodities, and commodities into signaling goods.
265 2018-08-21 04:03:00 Turn luxuries into commodities, and commodities into signaling goods.
266 2018-08-21 03:30:48 The use of liquid manure close to harvest of organic produce increases the risk of e coli and salmonella contamination. Bulk commodities, like wheat, wouldn't have a difference.
267 2018-08-21 03:24:59 Agree. Genuine difference maker wherever he is on the field. That trait is the rarest of commodities in the league.
268 2018-08-21 03:15:34 whosoever thinks that  Eco cash is plastic money is fooling himself. This soft money irikuuraya economy as it causes different commodity prices, it does not expressly buy all commodities, isn't accepted anywhere in the world and is limited to areas where Econet network reach

276 2018-08-21 02:32:24 Good morning!
Some breakfast for thought: Breakfast commodities showing divergent moves!
Coffee futures have fallen about 13-14% but orange juice futures have gained about 12-13% so far this year!
277 2018-08-21 02:32:23 Empower yourself by being stronger than the capitalist urge to consume addictive commodities.
278 2018-08-21 02:29:48 Free market capitalism is a great way of efficiently distributing commodities.  But there's just one little problem "Doctor": human health is not a commodity. What's the price elasticity on a life-saving treatment?
279 2018-08-21 02:27:37 Maybe time to change commodities. I burn a lot more fuel to make that.
280 2018-08-21 02:27:14 May as well trade Mookie and JD while they're hot commodities. Scuttle the organization, move it to Florida. Start fresh. Burn any trace of the Boston Red Sox.
281 2018-08-21 02:08:32 Vamos falar sobre esses gráficos? Analise nesse mesmo período (2002 a 2011) a guerra no Iraque, expansao da economia chinesa, valorização das commodities e queda do dólar. O que temos? Um Brasil em expansão devido a disponibilidade em excesso d crédito. Claro, o final já sabemos

285 2018-08-21 01:50:33 Plus commodities, competition etc.
286 2018-08-21 01:34:33 I don't think you're actually smart enough to comprehend this, but in a neoliberal capitalist society & economy... The economics of scale come into play, eg: the more purchasing power one has, the better deal on commodities one can get. Econ 101 dude.
287 2018-08-21 01:34:01 The Winklevoss brothers' Gemini and three other exchanges on Monday announced the creation of the Virtual Commodity Association Working Group, which could be a precursor to the formation of a self-regulatory organization for digital commodities like bitcoin and Ethereum.
288 2018-08-21 01:31:12 Exportar valor agregado, supongo que aclaras en el libro, porque exportar commodities solo es negocio para el selecto grupo de productores. 
Debemos mirar a Japón y su tecnología, no a Colombia y su café o a Sierra Leona y sus diamantes.
289 2018-08-21 01:20:22 Children are not commodities, but they don’t have full agency (aka self-ownership) until they can self-regulate and manage their own lives, so they do “belong” to another. I’d rather it be a gay couple than trailer trash, but ideally a husband and wife
290 2018-08-21 01:11:18 Explícame cómo controlas el precio cuando el producto es un commodities y donde en Argentina sigue siendo el precio más bajo de la region con todos los aumentos que hubo.
291 2018-08-21 01:09:18 kkkk parceiro comercial é boa. É a geração de "economistas" formada pela glo. Eles aprenderam um glossário de palavras q ñ sabem bem o q, significam: parceiro econômico , dívida interna, commodities, etc. Antigamente todo brasileiro era técnico de futebol, agora são economistas
292 2018-08-21 00:54:45 Can wait? The people working 60+ hours a week who can’t afford basic commodities can wait? So your argument went from it will not help those who need it to it can wait. There is no reason not to push for now along with whatever you think is priority.
293 2018-08-21 00:36:12 So sad 2 see black folks project their internalized anti-blackness towards Boots Riley. Apparently 2 some of u, black artists are commodities meant to inspire us only collect checks—be upwardly mobile niggas. y’all so indoctrinated that u hear him fight for us & get angry
294 2018-08-21 00:34:06 If you truly have faith in God you will respect what he gives you everyday, whether people or commodities. And very dearly he brought together some of his precious men to u by rejecting them you are actually rejecting God's will.
295 2018-08-21 00:33:48 Really sad that price of essential commodities like vibrators and sex toys have increased so much. All #Randuas n #Bhanduas in this govt haven't any use of them so they don't know their value. Only Sonia Mata knew that how priceless they were. #ModiHataoDeshBachao
296 2018-08-21 00:12:19 if one more person has the nerve to tell me i won’t make any money as a teacher i’m gonna loose my mind. maybe i want to actually inspire kids to learn and follow their dreams and not to be motivated by money and unhappy??? maybe idgaf if i can afford unnecessary commodities????
297 2018-08-21 00:08:58 So will it allow decent living standarts for slaves? For all arguments made back in the day, Andrew Ryan said that a slave lacks a choice, not commodities. Having medical help and decent housing but no say on any matters because GREATER GOOD would make a good totalitarian utopia.
