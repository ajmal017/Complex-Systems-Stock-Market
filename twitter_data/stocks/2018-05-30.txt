11 2018-05-30 23:55:21 Trump himself said he would raise the minimum age to purchase a gun to 21 and ban bump stocks.  Since then he, of course, has done neither.  #BeBest
12 2018-05-30 23:54:40 Why would you want the President to CONTROL everything. The bumb-stocks have been banned and the age raise was left to each state officials to decide what's best for them. Call your state officials and asked them why. What are we paying them 100s of THOUSANDS for?
13 2018-05-30 23:54:22 Aren't stocks pretty much supposed to be the individual rounds in a game? I know like dark stalkers has health advantage between rounds too

16 2018-05-30 23:53:58 You have no clue! Guns don’t kill people!!  It’s the medicated deranged non disciplined people with no clue of rite or wrong that kill people. Why are we not banning doctors for mow practice? They kill 100x more people then fire arms. Banning bump stocks will solve nothing!!!

41 2018-05-30 23:52:52 You're ignorant when it comes to guns, David. Banning bump stocks changes nothing. Restricting the ability to keep and bear arms violates the part about not infringing. How can you be almost done with school and know little to nothing about what is coming out of your mouth?

68 2018-05-30 23:40:06 Educate yourself. Bump stocks are not that accurate. They serve a purpose and it's not actually killing as many as possible. Anybody who knows guns, knows that the Vegas shooting would have been far worse if the gunman had learned how to use his weapon properly.
69 2018-05-30 23:40:03 Or that the money saved by corporations is going to buy back stocks to make more money for them? Not to higher wages or more jobs?  1 time bonuses are tax write offs for employers but raise taxes for employees?

81 2018-05-30 23:38:01 Actually you are not informed at all. You are believing fake claims from a fake American biologist , Read my bio. I was a commercial salmon fisher for years. Wild stocks were endangered long before fish farms were even thought of. Familiarize yourself with history of wild salmon.
82 2018-05-30 23:37:41 After you and the boys get rid of Medicaid and Medicare, your stocks will be sitting pretty. Quit pretending you give a shit. You don't, and we know it.
83 2018-05-30 23:37:15 Get em’ tiger! Don’t stop! Trump lied to all of the Parkland kids. He has no intention of banning bump stocks. The @NRA laundered too much Russian money for him!
84 2018-05-30 23:37:01 Investors buy stocks for returns and public companies should make it a priority to produce those returns.

96 2018-05-30 23:31:22 I own guns. Several including AR15s with bump stocks w/ bells and whistles  This being said this is my right. If you want to end school shootings.... You need to get to the core of the problem. I'm not the threat. The kids thinking it's ok to kill people they don't like is.

Thanks for making an accessible game about stocks and money management
108 2018-05-30 23:29:21 It's simple. Banning bump stocks and raising the age to 21 won't stop mass shootings. How many party's have you been to that had drunk teenager's?

111 2018-05-30 23:28:39 Diversity is key. A good investor will always spread their investments into bricks, cash, stocks, and so on. When the last market crash hit many stock holders lost a fortune. Those that had property still retained it. Slow and steady wins the race. Always!

116 2018-05-30 23:26:21 Trump has effectively banned bump stocks. But without Congress there's on so much a president can do.
   Now stop lying.
117 2018-05-30 23:26:03 Because bump stocks can be 3D printed and the other is unconstitutional.

135 2018-05-30 23:18:33 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
136 2018-05-30 23:18:23 @PressSec tRump sold out the students, saying he was in favor of comprhnsve backgrnd checks and no bump stocks, then bowing to the NRA, sending the issue into commission oblivion. Sarah Sanders lied to the boy's face w/ crocodile tears, then straight to -commission oblivion-again
137 2018-05-30 23:16:25 It's ok @realDonaldTrump abc stocks went down.

142 2018-05-30 23:13:25 unfortunately, due to the size of our database we're not able to generate a complete list of every store that stocks this item. We're sorry for the disappointment.
143 2018-05-30 23:13:24 TBH a credible way to bring down 45 would be to offer up a parade of celebrities who pay attention to him but also encourage him to make pronouncements about ending cash bail and banning bump stocks.
144 2018-05-30 23:13:05 Talk is cheap. Are you going to do something? We’re still waiting for a stricter enforcement of background checking for all weapons sales, ban on bum stocks and increasing the age to buy large capacity magazines weapons to 18. #AllTalkNoAction
145 2018-05-30 23:13:00 Ban bump stocks. No civilized human being not in the military needs access to these.
146 2018-05-30 23:12:06 Bitcoin is probably still the number one entry point for new users and it is also the best support crypto in mainstream exchanges (stocks exchanges).

153 2018-05-30 23:09:14 I have done at lot of research on this, and the Saudi assassination attempt is one possibility. From what I have heard it was more likely about shorted MGM stocks, government defense contracts, and 2A erosion. Our pal Soros was probably involved.
154 2018-05-30 23:09:05 Stop got hit at 17.00 on $hear. Still, was an excellent short play from 18.30. I'm tempted to short again at 17.50 but I think it's best to move on and find another opportunity in order to not get emotional #stocks
155 2018-05-30 23:08:47 @POTUS has actually done MORE productive things then Obama ever did. @POTUS is endorsed by the @NRA and he STILL wants to regulate bump stocks.....Obama would never go against his backers and never once did. Plus, no two schools are the same, the SCHOOLS need to take charge.
156 2018-05-30 23:08:28 Yeah. I am all up in that crypto. Not too keen on regular stocks.

I know he's a bit late for the party but that's the worst news I've had in a while
159 2018-05-30 23:06:33 This appears to be sort of a knee-jerk reaction for the corporation at this moment but see very few of their products accessories are considered consumable because of ammunition then you continuously have to buy ammunition and accessories, eventually stocks drop
160 2018-05-30 23:05:24 Why didn't @realDonaldTrump ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?

172 2018-05-30 22:58:31 Ever heard of an executive order? Trump has and loves to use them. In fact, he said he would use them to ban bump stocks.
173 2018-05-30 22:56:39 I took the time to let them know your page lies, and they should NOT ban bump stocks!  Thanks for the easy access link!

184 2018-05-30 22:49:10 When stocks crash ahead, shareholders will demand to know why these corporations used $$$ needed to survive the crisis to speculate in their own stock
185 2018-05-30 22:47:38 True. I 2add just responding to the idiot who thinks the are a lot of people who own bump stocks.  It's a very small niche market.
186 2018-05-30 22:46:58 Setiap negara punya hutang, it's not a one off payment. hutang dibayar progressively seiring dgn income/ revenue from that country in the long run..usually dibayar melalui hasil negara (cukai) & other govt revenue like stocks, bonds, assets disposal, govt investments & more.

194 2018-05-30 22:42:25 @sainsburys do you have a store checker to find my nearest store that stocks them?
195 2018-05-30 22:42:17 Yep and all they care about is screwing people that buy a sec reporting delinquent stocks it’s pathetic
196 2018-05-30 22:41:53 He did something no one else in the room will do (except @Acosta ). She still provided nothing of substance because they have done nothing of substance, not even their own recommendations. Per trump, bump stocks were going to be banned because it was “easy” to get done.
197 2018-05-30 22:41:36 no one ever discusses that baby boomers retirement forced sell of stocks kicking in now ,,,buybacks counter this as well
198 2018-05-30 22:41:16 Are you mentally challenged?? Not to be rude but the bill clearly says ALL IN POSSESSION BEFORE THE BAN HAVE BEEN GRANDFATHERED IN! You posted the damn bill and it clarified how the bump stocks/alterations are the ban. Good lord, READ WHAT YOU POSTED!!!
199 2018-05-30 22:40:57 Back to the question though. @realDonaldTrump hasn't even banned bump stocks like he said he would neither did he up the age to 21 to buy guns. He said he wasn't afraid of the @NRA, but once again that is a flat out lie.

216 2018-05-30 22:34:45 Everyone in their right mind knows that there is any pills out there that make you racist. I wonder how their stocks are doing today.
217 2018-05-30 22:34:43 Fly is a great and very versatile kill move, there's many instances you can hit it out of and learning when you can hit it can allow you to steal stocks under 100%. Just can't get too Fly happy as a whiff is a free charged smash or worse for your opponent.

225 2018-05-30 22:30:18 Have you apologized to Senator McCain for all the repugnant remarks you made about him? And... Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA ?

227 2018-05-30 22:28:41 @CNBC @jimcramer I agree with you that U.S. stocks trade are the best practice because it is a 100% trade to a 100% trade. Not a 94.84% trade from the Europeans! and sub-par from the Asian markets!
228 2018-05-30 22:28:34 Have you apologized to your family for having an affair with a porn star? And... Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA ?

240 2018-05-30 22:22:22 If you read the bill in it’s entirety, your question can be answered in very specific detail in long winded sentences. And the bill hones in on bump stocks/rounds of ammunition that alter the gun with specific features.

249 2018-05-30 22:18:52 Bump stocks are not banned yet. And are probably not even enforceable. Town halls are not a new policy. If she answered his question by saying nothing b/c they’ve done nothing, then I guess you’re correct. She answered him. 
But why lie abt it. It’s ok to say the truth. Geez

252 2018-05-30 22:17:08 Agreed. But no matter what stocks do, unless they crash, it doesn't effect the average American. The crash only effects them negatively, but a booming stock market only really jails those with the most stocks. Of which 83% were owned by top 10% of earners.

255 2018-05-30 22:16:11 I don’t know of anyone saying he hasn’t profited form his position. Anyone with stocks profited from his position... anyone who was unemployed who is now employed benefited from his position... no, he said he’s not taking the presidential salary. He’s donating it.

259 2018-05-30 22:11:47 What about focusing on your promise to ban bump stocks? Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
260 2018-05-30 22:11:39 would u mind clearing up for me exactly how raising age limits and banning magizines and bump stocks will stop killing
261 2018-05-30 22:11:20 I was and still am longterm bullish on gene editing stocks, but these companies are still in their infancy. Still a new technology. Better, safer investment entries will come later down the road.
262 2018-05-30 22:10:22 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
263 2018-05-30 22:10:08 Called penny stocks
264 2018-05-30 22:10:05 They are dishonest? Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
265 2018-05-30 22:09:49 I do currently stocks trade US dollar for Pesos and Yang never ever EU currency the value never moves
266 2018-05-30 22:09:11 Also just a head up Obama did more for the 2a then trump ever could in fact trump is the one who is taking away bump stocks and most likely ARs at some point
267 2018-05-30 22:08:14 This CRISPR news is totally normal in the context of new technologies, biotech, stops and starts, background volatility, etc.

I just wonder if generalists who have been piling into the stocks know that it's still preclinical and are prepared for all of the above ups and downs.
268 2018-05-30 22:07:29 So what is a better way to invest in small cap stocks? For most, do regular LT Indexing. Forget the active fund hype. They lag the index and charge you fees. Also, they don’t adjust returns for risk. Ask them, can you beat not only the index, but the “spread” index.
269 2018-05-30 22:06:20 What vote are we discussing? Did Congress vote for sale of bump stocks?
270 2018-05-30 22:06:17 Yes recessions always are bare, but I disagree with the notion that regulation and policy keeps companies from thriving. Right now companies are taking their tax cuts buying back their stocks and using the money to close plants & move manufacturing overseas just like Harley D.
271 2018-05-30 22:05:06 And it doesn't help that the default time period to evaluate stocks (e.g. any headline or Google search) is one day. Talk about forest for the trees. Life is a journey and very rarely does anything you do on one day alone matter in a vacuum.
272 2018-05-30 22:05:06 One thing I know for certain: We are all capable of great success; but we are only as good as the stocks we trade.

276 2018-05-30 22:03:18 Ban bump stocks! Ban bump stocks!
Thank you David. Very impressed by your and your peers’ determination to stop this madness and for inspiring my teenage child to expand awareness and live with the conviction to always do the right thing. Proud of all of you, don’t give up!
277 2018-05-30 22:03:15 the challenge will be holding the capitalistic law firms "accountable".  Who knows, they could be double dipping with personal investments/stocks in drug companies AND leading the lawsuits, genuine quandary.
278 2018-05-30 22:03:09 This military retired family, 43 year federal police officer support common sense gun REGULATIONS FOR: Military AR weapons (designed to destroy from joint to joint), bump stocks, silencers, minimum age requirements, and unstable individuals
279 2018-05-30 22:03:02 Lol! All your tax cuts did was give corporations money to buy back their stocks trickle-down economics does not work #GOPTaxScam
280 2018-05-30 22:01:53 There is no reason why bump stocks or automatic weapons should be available outside of military and law  enforcement. Ban them.

282 2018-05-30 22:01:17 I was actually first starting an Etrade account and it told me to enter a correct city. Haha well I think I know what city I live in. I called TD and they said I could purchase caveat emptor penny stocks. So I ended up going with them. My main account is Fidelity.

285 2018-05-30 21:59:10 Could have picked 1900 and Gold has stilled outperformed stocks. Hilarious if not a completely moronic argument. Understand the concern with biased analysts but obviously doesn't know who he is dealing with nor has ever been taught basic manners or common courtesy.
286 2018-05-30 21:58:55 Hopefully it's for all drugs and not the ones his friends and families have stocks on.

Still waiting on that Apple stock @RobinhoodApp
292 2018-05-30 21:54:07 Now I'm wondering how many decades of penny stock trading I'd have to do before trading big boy stocks and making triple digit earnings per week? Care to stake me for 20% when the money starts rolling in?
293 2018-05-30 21:54:00 so you have confidence that EW cannot be overridden by Central Bank shenanigans?  Bank of Japan is buying stocks outright!  With money created out of thin air!!  Same with Swiss CB.
294 2018-05-30 21:51:27 Oh my god, stocks will go down!!! Fuck the guys on the top, they’re the problem.

299 2018-05-30 21:48:43 No idea who this author is but there’s a whole lot written about shorting/institutional ownership that makes no sense & is just wrong.

Stocks have . . . Stockholders . . . Don’t bet against them!  Heavily shorted stocks historically underperform and whole premise is nonsense.

302 2018-05-30 21:48:05 What a load of rubbish !

Good stocks can remain fundamentally cheap indefinitely if they are in downtrend

Good investors use FA to pick their stocks and TA to confirm their entry

You think TA is comparing resource size lol, so charts and big terms might be lost on you 
303 2018-05-30 21:47:59 Of course no one uses #bitcoin for purchases, it's obscenely time-consuming to trade it back to Fiat via an #exchange, #exchange fees can be high and are not always consistent, and the price of the #Bitcoin itself fluctuates. The same reason no one buys things with stocks!
304 2018-05-30 21:47:58 History shows that, on average, just two stocks from the global market-cap top 10 list remain on the list a decade later.

307 2018-05-30 21:45:54 Hogg is directly quoting Trump’s statement that he would “ban bump stocks and raise the firearm purchase age to 21.” Whatever Trump meant by “ban” (whether it be through exec order or by proposing legislation to Congress), Trump hasn’t done either so I don’t see what’s wrong...
308 2018-05-30 21:45:38 45 also promised to ban bump stocks.  Guess what?  That never happened.  His base is solidly AGAINST gun control and his $$$ backers are, too.
309 2018-05-30 21:45:14 Good case for holding a substantial amount of stocks, not just bonds, throughout retirement.

311 2018-05-30 21:43:57 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
312 2018-05-30 21:43:56 Unfortunately, there are no more supplies left. It appeared in July last year. The purchase was while stocks last. Currently, you can search for used on American eBay.

315 2018-05-30 21:43:34 You had 1 word right..bliss. Couldn’t be happier with DT. These politicians basically did everything they wanted for yrs. Now they actually work. Unemployment at all time low, Isis gone, N Korea caving, Bonus/raise, lower taxes, 401k/stocks exploding, and liberals crying=bliss!

322 2018-05-30 21:40:07 If anything were to have sent $DIS down specifically (and it wasn’t, like you said, a general downturn for media stocks), I’d say it would have been Comcast trying to snag Fox out from under them (like one of those jerk last-second bidders on eBay), not this Roseanne business.
323 2018-05-30 21:36:47 Trump said he'd release his tax returns. He promised universal healthcare. He said he'd fight to ban bump stocks and raise gun buying age to 21. He said he'd be a champion for LGBT rights (then tried to ban them from military service). He says a lot of shit and does 1/10th of it.
324 2018-05-30 21:36:37 Nice! All steel stocks are ripping higher after hours 
325 2018-05-30 21:34:52 That’s the only reason why the stocks surged! 
326 2018-05-30 21:34:44 No more meetings, thoughts and prayers. These kids need ‘specific’ actions! How abt banning the AR15, close loop holes in background cks, ban bump stocks. Kids deserve to feel safe

336 2018-05-30 21:27:58 How big are these stocks?
337 2018-05-30 21:27:15 agreed completely
338 2018-05-30 21:26:46 Also a function of relative opportunity. I’d be more inclined to question the relative potential if stocks or bonds weren’t so expensive.

346 2018-05-30 21:21:00 I believe it would likely take an extensive sell-off in tech stocks (ie., when the overall stock bubble bursts).
347 2018-05-30 21:20:51 Nope. Just bump stocks, double triggers or any weapon convertible into rapid fire.  Handguns are ok.  Shotguns are ok.  Both suitable for home defense.  I have both.  I don't think any ar style rifle should be sold.  Not confiscated, but not made it sold on the market.

No one needs an ar-15 to hunt. If you need one to hunt, you suck at hunting.

You don't need bump stocks either.
359 2018-05-30 21:17:04 I’d rather have my stocks make me money

Puerto Rican’s and students are still dying thanks to your inaction.Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
363 2018-05-30 21:15:04 If you find out, let me know. I don't even know how to buy stocks, let alone ones from overseas T_T
364 2018-05-30 21:14:57 Veto, luego stocks buyback.
365 2018-05-30 21:14:40 Sad.i saw that there were many fishermen on the lake than the fish stocks.
366 2018-05-30 21:13:08 After Las Vegas he said he would work on banning bump stocks. At the Parkland Town Hall he told those kids he thought the NRA would have no problem raising age to 21. He's done nothing. He's owned by the NRA.
367 2018-05-30 21:12:49 @PressSec you’re lying! The administration didn’t ban bum stocks, didn’t raise the age to purchase weapons, so you’re lying 
368 2018-05-30 21:12:48 what kinda pisses me off is that its anime gfx so doesnt matter, but you did use most of those stocks in like 75% of the header lol
369 2018-05-30 21:12:29 We don’t need studies and commissions while children are being killed. We need action! Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
370 2018-05-30 21:11:43 The value has decreased drastically and that's a shame #politics going to look for some other #stocks
371 2018-05-30 21:10:48 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21? You said you would. Are you afraid of the @NRA? Are you? Are you actually scared of them?
372 2018-05-30 21:10:46 Why didn't you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 ehen uou said you would? Are you afraid of the @nra?

382 2018-05-30 21:06:49 Who cares? Trade the price action and the Momo, not the ticker.
383 2018-05-30 21:05:42 If a you actually believes bump stocks enabled this massacre, you need to analyze the logic used to arrive at your final decision. It's flawed.....big time. Your emotions are driving your rationalization, not logic.
384 2018-05-30 21:05:27 completely and utterly disappointing on so many levels!

390 2018-05-30 21:03:19 the only way you’re going to get us to stop complaining is by passing laws that were promised (banning bump stocks and raising the buying age to 21) as well as other gun reform laws. until then, we have every right to complain

406 2018-05-30 21:00:28 I owned it too, but sold too early 4-5 months ago. I need to remember that stocks often shoot too much to the upside before falling and vice-versa. Thus, it may have more room to run from a technical perspective.

408 2018-05-30 20:59:25 Yeah, they were pretty interesting. The issue is just the limited time period. I want to look at Fench industry/sector data and see if the pseudo spot commodity exposure is there out of sample. I also thought the avoiding the worst stocks was insightful.

410 2018-05-30 20:58:58 Ban bump stocks now!
411 2018-05-30 20:58:55 The Las Vegas Shooting, as bad as it was, should have been so much worse had Paddock been a competent shooter and didn’t use bump stocks. It’s likely Paddock’s only aimed shots from 10:05 to 10:07 resulted in controlled hits; the rest from 10:08-10:15 were random saving lives.
412 2018-05-30 20:58:44 I’d separate the legal definition of securities (which describe barious asset classes like bonds, stocks, etc) from the asset itself. Commodities vary quite a bit - real estate vs gold vs corn, etc.

420 2018-05-30 20:52:35 Cryptocurrencies are not securities.

@bgarlinghouse CEO of #Ripple, pointed out a few differences between #XRP and classic #securities, like #stocks.

"If you own XRP, you don't own rights to the #profits or any #dividends to the company," he said. "XRP has real utility."
421 2018-05-30 20:51:33 Pretty confident they don't invest in individual stocks.
422 2018-05-30 20:50:28 Yes. I think this pause is shirt lived. Just because one buys stocks the underlying risk is not absolved.
423 2018-05-30 20:50:21 No.  The retiree in the mid 60s just gets crushed no matter what they owned (stocks/bonds). I really want to look at adding EW energy (for commodity exposure), gold, etc. at some % of the portfolio as in inflation hedge...and maybe TF that too.
424 2018-05-30 20:50:05 The lowest competent shooter should score a lethal hit rate of 70% at optimum range, which Paddock was, or 770 lethal kills. Paddock managed to kill only 58, or 0.3%. His use of bump stocks likely saved hundreds of lives.

That’s no consolation to those killed, wounded or hurt.

431 2018-05-30 20:45:57 To be fair, bump stocks have only been used in one shooting. The most devastating shooting of recent years, but still just one out of many.

440 2018-05-30 20:42:16 1) @PressSec you have crossed a line, lying to American children right in their face. If this admin was actually taking gun violence and school shootings seriously, then why has it lied about banning bump stocks?! Why did you all lie about raising the minimum age
441 2018-05-30 20:41:26 By my numbers that’s partially why it helped... if trend following you may not hold bonds (when stocks up). No need to inflation adjust % of AUM withdrawals.
442 2018-05-30 20:41:23 No Dick face. 82% of all Americans want a ban on bump stocks. 82% of all people in this country. Be the minority on an easy issue, it’s dumb but go ahead. I thought you guys hated minorities though.

516 2018-05-30 20:12:03 You could ban bump stocks, but it won’t change for those using bump stocks for illegal use. You can make a bump stock. You don’t need to go and buy one. Do you think law abiding citizens are making nefarious plans for a bump stock?

520 2018-05-30 20:11:12 What about the ban on bump-stocks and raising the purchasing age to 21 on firearms like your husband said he would.
521 2018-05-30 20:11:05 @GiffordsCourage Ignorance is not courage...bump stocks were NOT the issue, ISIS was...wake up you fools! PS Blocked
522 2018-05-30 20:10:45 Ask your husband, “Why didn’t he ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when he said he would? Is he afraid of the @NRA?

532 2018-05-30 20:08:48 How has this admin taken school gun violence seriously? Why hasn’t Trump banned bump stocks and raised the minimum age to 21 like he said he would?
533 2018-05-30 20:07:36 Really?  Republicans care?  Ok, where's the legislation?  They have both the Senate, House, and the presidency...  So what's stopping them?  What's stopping a EO on bump stocks?

539 2018-05-30 20:05:59 It was you & the rest of the Obama Klan that allowed bump stocks to start with, so all of those killed by use of bump stocks, their blood is on your hands & I hope people start holding you accountable!
540 2018-05-30 20:05:57 What a difference a day makes! All green today after yesterday's mess.  Everything was up: stocks, rates, crude, etc. Breadth very solid - in fact much stronger than yesterday's weakness: 4.3 to 1 and 6.9 to 1. Guess you just have to buy the dips and move on.

546 2018-05-30 20:05:19 I’m cool with that as long as we raise the age to vote, drive, join the military etc also. Bump stocks are stupid and make you way less accurate so ban them I don’t care. I would also like to ban people under 21 from being on social media and tv interviews!

550 2018-05-30 20:04:25 Agreed. Like how does banning bump stocks help? He acts on emotion not on logic.
551 2018-05-30 20:04:14 Executive orders on constitutional law. Brilliant idea! That’s in no way going to create a tyrannical precedent. Second, you didn’t say he had a hand, you said he just didn’t do it. But he has called for congress to create bills banning bump stocks and expanding mental health
552 2018-05-30 20:04:08 Could've done it without bump stocks. Needed a hotel room. Ban hotel rooms.

562 2018-05-30 19:59:16 For not keeping his promise to ban bump stocks for one. “After the Florida high school massacre last month, Mr. Trump explicitly called on live television for raising the age limit to purchase rifles and backed 2013 legislation for near-universal background checks. “
563 2018-05-30 19:58:10 (2/2) What we have is a 1) Failed breakout above LT resistance days ago 2) Massive gap down through an uptrend line + the 50-day MA & 3) Relatively feeble bounce despite stocks ripping higher. Maybe it's nothing. But it sure looks like bonds "ain't buyin' what stocks are sellin'"

577 2018-05-30 19:52:49 This administration has sided w/ NRA. Trump spoke at NRA Convention to make certain they KNEW he was STILL in their pocket, even AFTER telling David Hogg he'd ban bump stocks. THIS story does NOT reflect the ACTIONS of this administration. Don't peddle b.s. Truth matters Tapper!
578 2018-05-30 19:52:39 So I used a limit stop loss with @etrade and it indicated that it executed. So I went back to check on my portfolio I noticed that all of my gains were wiped out. Checked under my orders it stated that the limit stop was still open... explain to us what happened? #trader #stocks
579 2018-05-30 19:52:35 Used proceeds to open a small position in $ATBPF $ATE.V at 0.385. It's been on the watchlist ever since it jumped back in March, and it's been trading REAL tight lately. Impressive drug pipeline for such a small cap company. Also much more liquid than most stocks at that price.
580 2018-05-30 19:52:22 The Russell 3000 hit an all-time intra-day high today, do you have small cap stocks in your portfolio?  If you don't, you are missing out.  By the way, they very rarely talk about small cap stocks on CNBC...  #smallcapstocks #markets

583 2018-05-30 19:51:23 That's right - stocks are going up b/c cos. are buying back their stocks to benefit the shareholders rather than saving jobs & enriching employees. And they're still leaving the country - close to 100,000 jobs have been outsourced since Trump took office and it's still happening.
584 2018-05-30 19:50:43 Stocks should be rising if that was true. More than pennies.

618 2018-05-30 19:38:12 Need to think like Axelrod. Shorting Italian govvies isn’t enough. There’s more liquid markers like bunds, treasuries and European stocks to play in. Chfeur, swaps spreads, Ultimate trade was German debt vs Italian debt...but gotta assess liquidity getting in and out

For people who stockpile their canned goods (or other long life dry foods) I recommend rotating your stocks (oldest to front) & consuming your oldest products before their end of use dates. Even if good, nutritional value goes down as they age.

622 2018-05-30 19:37:34 Okay....sooo... it's better to be private? and not go public with stocks?
623 2018-05-30 19:37:29 they sold out to DISNEY who now have a leveraging hold of their stocks that is why suddenly they have all these left wing people on the network even the five were attacking ROSEANN saying she deserved to be fired She was wrong and disgusting ok but give me a breakno lib is fired
624 2018-05-30 19:36:16 I am a little confused though. So keeping private in stocks will help them going through a fate like Fantiago's or going public might save them from such situations?

632 2018-05-30 19:33:28 What unites us is the anger over lack of action by this admin.

643 2018-05-30 19:29:38 We all feel so sad about this horrendous epidemic . That said, we need real gun law reform. Ban assault weapons!  Ban bump stocks!  Ban high capacity magazines!  Impose universal background checks! This is what must be done!  Lastly, politicians stop taking blood soaked NRA $$!

775 2018-05-30 18:37:10 Yesterday, Italy scared all the lemmings, US stocks down 1.6%. Today, fear has subsided, stocks up 1.4%. Maybe investors should relax and look at the horizon, not at the day-to-day news.
776 2018-05-30 18:37:01 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?

Y’all too broke to worry about something that doesn’t benefit your pockets 
781 2018-05-30 18:33:41 "The plumbing of..." to describe finance, healthcare, etc used to drive me crazy. What about the plumbing of plumbing??

This description by Dana Meadows made me more amenable to its use: "The plumbing structure: the stocks and flows and their physical arrangements"

All press including @DuncanLindsay
Released his name as ryan stocks
Same surname as the midwife
I honestly dont get how ppl r shocked lol #payattention #vanity
783 2018-05-30 18:32:16 Nope. You dont get it. You are trying to paper over the cracks.  You ban bump stocks and nothing changes.
784 2018-05-30 18:31:55 I'm not exactly understanding Disney's "disappointment" with Solo. It wasn't Star Wars, but was their own fault for using such a high budget. Otherwise, I thought it was a fun, easy movie to watch with a couple surprises. Disney has other things to worry about for tanking stocks.
785 2018-05-30 18:31:24 Look at the bond market and 10yr30yr spread....crashing back to trend in spite of the dollar...and despite stocks up, gold flat.....maybe time to buy some SPY puts.

@tomemmer refuses to answer these questions.
789 2018-05-30 18:30:43 I guess the irony of such comments coming on the heels of the Obama "I, I, I, Me, Me, Me, I I...We are the ones we've been waiting for" Presidency are completely lost on you, eh? Stick to stocks my friend... Trump is only the 2nd most narcissistic of the last 2 Presidents.

804 2018-05-30 18:26:27 I dont know any bagholders.  Maybe you can reference some bagholders here? You are only bag holders on trashy stocks.  This is by far one of those.  Flippers become bag holders when they dont have the money to hold.

Just ask his ex-wives.  Just ask the kids he told he would get rid of bump-stocks and raise legal limit of long guns to 21.  Just as the people that got no tax cuts, or a tax cut so small that the cost of gasoline costs more than the tax cut.

835 2018-05-30 18:12:23 Hogg's friends said why at the "March for Lives" rally. "Give us an inch, and we will take a mile", or in other words "Give us bump stocks&21, our foot will be in the door to take all guns". "We are not against the 2nd" is they lie. If true they would not be demonizing the NRA.

846 2018-05-30 18:09:28 Not sure there is a correlation between the two actions, so not convinced there will be any change to prices.  Just the same, to blanketly assume that phara stocks will "surge" is ludicrous.  It is the answer I would predict from academia (enourmous endowments, obscene tuitions).

849 2018-05-30 18:07:34 Ban bump stock and raise the age to buy firearms to 21 and there will still be just as many shootings. Bump stocks and age requirement for firearms isn't the problem here folks.
850 2018-05-30 18:07:30 During my first couple of years trading, I charted stocks by hand on graph paper. We didn't have charts, indicators, the internet, nothing but the price in the paper each day. Stock trading is not just in my head, it's in my soul. I'm still here 35 years later.  Excuses???
851 2018-05-30 18:07:20 If you hear nothing about the stock market, stocks are probably up.

If you hear bad news occasionally, stocks are probably flat.

You’ll know stocks are actually down when the news says the sky is falling.

872 2018-05-30 18:00:23 When I started trading in early 1980's, I couldn't afford quotes, so I stood outside (with an umbrella on raining days) a brokerage firm that had a Quotron for customers to use. I would go in every 10-15 minutes and check my stocks. I did it every day for two years. True story!
873 2018-05-30 18:00:06 Yea your right, if you actually have captial and can afford to hold them like stocks. Not unload pairs at rock bottom prices. But I guess that’s what re sellers have to do when they have no captial
874 2018-05-30 17:59:00 I don’t want to hear their arguments anymore. I don’t want to hear that they’re paranoid that sought off shotgun’s and bump stocks will ultimately result in the abolition of the Second Amendment.

908 2018-05-30 17:48:16 The announcement happened after the stocks had dropped, but the cancellation was pre announcement. So since sources say cancellation was almost immediate; it was hours between decision, and cancellation this is most likely true.

910 2018-05-30 17:47:41 Liberal logic 101:  Don’t ban abortion or drugs.  It only produces more undesirable outcomes and black markets.  Do ban certain mean looking guns and bump stocks because that’ll stop the bad guys !  Learn basic economics.

963 2018-05-30 17:37:01 There is no evidence that there are systematic distortions such increased mispricing or even increased correlations among stocks because of ETFs. However, we don’t have enough observations for crash periods to make any claims.

971 2018-05-30 17:34:07 So then why not ban bump stocks and raise the age to 21
972 2018-05-30 17:34:06 ...USDA had reported an 8.9 bb Q2 stox figure on us. Using average 2nd-half demand resulted in an ending stocks projection of 2.9 bb (11-yr average) to 3.8 bb (4-yr avg). Low prices were only going lower because the U.S. overproduced again. Then it got dry in SAm, things changed.

995 2018-05-30 17:27:12 "...least bearish they'be in 2-3 years" is well stated. That is correct. But low prices didn't cure low prices. The U.S. got damn lucky there was a SAm drought. Otherwise demand wouldn't be up, '17 production was still 2nd largest on record, and stocks would be astronomical.

Are you afraid of the @NRA?
1046 2018-05-30 17:17:32 Of course you'd jump to that conclusion. It seems everyone automatically assumes anybody with an opposing view is without common sense. However like most automatic weapons bump stocks are basically only good for support/cover fire.

1075 2018-05-30 17:11:24 Here’s his question again in case you forgot- How exactly do bump stocks relate to the ability of gun owners to defend themselves, family, and country?
1076 2018-05-30 17:11:08 well there's been enough fraud in the past 6th months a 1st graded would catch on. 1st lesson, if it's from @GlobeNewswire and seems too good to be true, it probably is.

1088 2018-05-30 17:08:11 The tax scam is an atrocity visited on Americans. Gas prices rising, national debt out of control that our grandchildren will be paying for, health costs rising, and Walmart gives a token bonus on paychecks while buying back stocks. We’ll undo this in 1919. And raise Corp. taxes
1089 2018-05-30 17:07:17 @narendramodi sir, Thank you for reducing "1" Paisa on petrol after a hike of 16 days. Where to invest these savings. I want your suggestions sir, where can I  invest mutual funds or stocks??
1090 2018-05-30 17:07:02 As a rule of thumb, I never play options on stocks under $10 since the price of the stock is so low it's like a perpetual call option with no expiry date. Just my two cents.
1091 2018-05-30 17:06:53 I shorted it at 63.83 and got out too early. 
Not the type of stock that i trade, i find those stocks harder to trade so there's a high level of fear.

1097 2018-05-30 17:05:11 Wall Street Down?  Nah....that was so...yesterday. Stocks sharply higher as financial shares rebounded from steep losses in the prior session and Italian credit fears eased. Feeling better now?
1098 2018-05-30 17:04:45 Agreed... Altho summer volume as every year.. I think markets will stay and go higher into the July 4th Holliday, thus taking strong stocks with it.. $ISRG been consolidating on declining volume.. Bodes well, still holding July 500 calls. Thanks for the charts as always

1142 2018-05-30 16:51:57 Good point, as even a quant like me who is not using earnings forecasts is still making an implicit forecast that the portfolio of stocks he/she has bought will do well. I'm thinking more of the "This is the market top, get out now" type of forecast.
1143 2018-05-30 16:51:13 I think most people feel that’s OK.  It’s more the opinion “If the team stocks the infield to one side, you NEED to bunt against the shift.  Your a MLB player, learn to bunt.”

1218 2018-05-30 16:26:46 Stocks rebounding after yesterday's huge drop (DOW currently sitting at +296).  MBS has dropped 25bps and Yields have risen up to 2.85%.  OPEC decided to remain status quo and not release more oil to compensate Venezuela and Iran, so prices rise.
1219 2018-05-30 16:26:36 Actually I think he did ban bump stocks because the NRA doesn't really care about those. But he did cave in on everything else that he said he was going to do
1220 2018-05-30 16:26:22 Sobre todo las empresas chinas . Han pasado en un mes de ser los patitos feos a despuntar . Aunque hay que tener cuidado porque son súper volátiles .

1222 2018-05-30 16:25:29 Hey sycophants - gas prices are the highest they have been since 2014. Your boy Trump is still buying and selling stocks so he's manipulating the market. I got a $12 raise from your tax cut - following week were all fired. Good thing - can't afford to drive to work.

1311 2018-05-30 16:01:28 That is a question that you've ignored too long. While I don't think the NRA deserves the blame for what's going on, bump stocks, semi auto guns, and BG checks really should be no brainers to implement.

1333 2018-05-30 15:56:44 Thanks for the kind words. My opinion isn't quite as cut and dried as I make it out to be. Clearly there are times when it makes sense to invest in bonds vs. stocks. I also sometimes look at distressed debt as a form of mispricing of downside risk.
1334 2018-05-30 15:56:42 @realDonaldTrump "you won't have to worry about bump stocks---that will be gone". The young people are waiting, we all are for you to prove you are not afraid of the @NRA.

1390 2018-05-30 15:44:07 Why did Obama approve Bump Stocks in the first place? Why Obama did not do anything to help Chicago become less violent in his 8 years? Is he compromised? Why did he sell uranium to Russia and give billions in cash to Iran. Obama is a traitor.

But besides that, it was 1 shooting, yes it killed alot of people, but it's nowhere near other statics on other firearm homicides. The number of people to die by bump stocks ever (accidental and on purpose) is probably below 100, definitely below 200. That's not many.

Honestly it's probably both. The continuation of the pummeling is likely due to the secondary.

1718 2018-05-30 14:36:41 Ok my side of that. Bump stocks are pointless, all you need is a belt loop to create the same effect. 2.) The age is already 21 to buy pistols, and most guns used in school shooting are taken from the parents. So neither law would change anything, that's why he hasn't done them.

1739 2018-05-30 14:33:29 Vista outdoor stock is down ($16 from $40) as are all of the gun stocks. The real money was when Obama was in office. Gun sales were out of this world.
1740 2018-05-30 14:33:08 You should have paid attention in Civics.  The Legislature makes the laws not the Executive Branch.   President signs it into law or vetoes it. Bump stocks were not banned in last Obama vote on same topic.

1743 2018-05-30 14:32:24 I repeat, "sale" of bump stocks was approved during the Obama admin. Did not say it was invented during the Obama admin.

1748 2018-05-30 14:31:38 Because banning bump stocks and raising the age limit is your idea. Not the NRA’s. So I’m guessing the president is allowing you to share your opinion, but he doesn’t have to follow or agree on any of it. Being afraid has nothing to do with the issue.

1750 2018-05-30 14:31:24 It would be more effective if you weren’t stuck on repeat on a more important issue. Name one crime other than the Vegas shooting where bump stocks were used?  Yes, it was awful and bump stocks may have made it worse but it’s a tiny %. You should go after illegal guns instead.

Next month to buy same set you may need more or less depending. So it's not exactly 10K each month.less or more.adjust periodically

1766 2018-05-30 14:28:17 Because FANG stocks are fickle and go up and down with the whims of Jim Cramer or whoever’s on CNBC now. It’s not about the core business. MS on the other hand isn’t new and trendy so that valuation is based on things the company actually does.

1789 2018-05-30 14:23:19 I’m not in favor of bump stocks, but to be fair can we get some numbers to backup the request? How many times have bump stocks been used in attacks with firearms? How many times have bump stocks been used illegally at all in the US?

1936 2018-05-30 13:57:31 If the past 10 years taught us anything, it's that its much better for US stocks to have lower rates and a weaker European economy than higher rates and same mediocre European economy.

1961 2018-05-30 13:52:50 Most hedge funds and big traders do not use stops and yesterday is the perfect example. Retail traders were all stopped out sitting in cash with a loss at the open while everyone else is ringing the cash register with huge gap up holding stocks and calls.

2010 2018-05-30 13:44:29 Bonds will not save you this time. 
I would rather be in overvalued stocks than bonds in a recession if inflation is running hot. The data supports this view as well. With real rates being the new focus of the Fed in the future, I expect gold to perform very well too of course.

2034 2018-05-30 13:39:30 Absolutely! If you'd do something responsible like that, maybe your presidency might have a legacy. You know, "45's Executive Order banning bump stocks and enacting gun control measures resulted in an amazing reduction in mass shootings. The best ever reduction."

Short term borrowing rates are up. Lots of stock but backs
2049 2018-05-30 13:35:28 Yep because bump stocks and semi-automatic rifles give me that sense of peace I've so been missing. I'm all for the right to bear arms AND being sensible about distinguishing weapons of war from firearms for gaming/self-protection.  Whatever happened to common sense?

2052 2018-05-30 13:35:07 The ONLY Sino-American trade policies that make sense to the U. S. are to (1) confiscate ALL the U.

2053 2018-05-30 13:34:58 The willy nilly effort to ban different guns and bump stocks  in cities across the nation is the attempt to slowly erode the Second Amendment. Stand up America to the Liberal Democratic Socialist Communist Party who is trying to destroy AMERICA.

2059 2018-05-30 13:34:29 By definition, bonds will always be larger than stocks because of the product design...institutional equity desks are just as “plugged in” as any other desk
2060 2018-05-30 13:33:18 You should actually look around and pay attention to the world rather than believing what Trump tells you. The economy is not doing well at all. Gas prices and inflation are on the rise. Stocks are down. Tariffs are causing American companies to close and people are losing jobs.
2061 2018-05-30 13:33:10 Really? Again. Ok, maybe you really don't know how our system of government works if you think the President, any President, can snap his fingers to magically  ban bump stocks and raise the age to 21. The separation of powers prevents it for very good reason.

2197 2018-05-30 13:10:36 We've long been saying that if stocks just stop rising, it will quickly translate into weaker US consumption bc [US Net Cap Gains + US Taxable IRA Distribs = 200% of annual PCE (Personal Consumption Exp) growth].  Stocks stopped rising in 1q18
2198 2018-05-30 13:10:30 It just doesn't make any sense to me, even from a business perspective. It has to hurt their stocks or what have you whenever bad shit like this gets picked up by mainstream media.

2238 2018-05-30 13:05:08 Slide Fire Systems, the manufacturer of 'bump-stocks' has ceased operations. There are no more in production to ban. In prohibition states, few bump-stocks have been surrendered. We can still bump-fire with a 2x4 and wooden dowel, rubber band, or from our belt loop.

2241 2018-05-30 13:04:49 It’s his congress! If he told them to ban the bump stocks, they’d do it. But he, nor they, have any intention of protecting school children.

2246 2018-05-30 13:04:04 Most probable causes, concentrated portfolio, not hugely diversified, and AIM  stocks that tend to be volitile. Not junk stock just volitile. This happened last Mat also. All time high then almost all gains dribbed away until end of year.
2247 2018-05-30 13:04:03 Lol. The Constitution does not guarantee you a right to own any gun you want. Sawed off shotguns for example, have been banned for years. We can ban bump stocks and tactical rifles and high capacity magazines.

2380 2018-05-30 12:54:26 The saying that bonds are smarter than stocks is the essence of behavioral finance biases...all markets are a function of people ..I’d agree that there is an edge for some folks doing research on individual companies, but indices and asset classes are a level playing field..

2551 2018-05-30 12:07:51 And paying off the mortgage seems pretty extreme - better to be able to service the debt whilst not working, in terms of the premium for the insurance.

2579 2018-05-30 11:57:18 I highly doubt your statistics. But even if "Dick's Sporting Goods" Stocks did jump, it's not uncommon for the company to buy back shares from those who are selling off.

2581 2018-05-30 11:56:45 Ban bump-stocks !!!
2582 2018-05-30 11:56:16 Hi, when going short on Stocks IG would actually need to borrow the stocks in the market and then sell them at the price you are viewing online, in order for this to happen IG would need to gain borrow in the market. Unfortunately a borrow cannot always be found on all stocks. GM

2587 2018-05-30 11:54:01 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would?
2588 2018-05-30 11:53:25 NHS Blood and Transplant needs donors with O negative and B negative blood to donate now as stocks are low due to a drop in donations over the Bank holiday.

2591 2018-05-30 11:52:26 European stocks are bouncing back Wednesday, having taken a big hit earlier in the week as news of #Italy's growing political crisis spread. Having fallen almost 3% on Tuesday, Italy's benchmark share index, the FTSE MIB is up more than 2% in early afternoon trading. @i24NEWS_EN
2592 2018-05-30 11:51:17 Nifty will remain range bound but small and mid cap stocks will go down

2597 2018-05-30 11:47:04 banning bump stocks would be a first step in the effort to eliminate mass shootings.
2598 2018-05-30 11:46:38 If bump stocks get banned are you and your friends going to stop demanding something? That's how a negotiation or compromise works. Or it's just a list of ever increasing demands to a thinly veiled goal. Bumpstocks to magazines to pistol grips to semiautos to handguns to no guns!

2601 2018-05-30 11:44:25 Liberal mental illness huh? We don’t put guns before our children lives. I know for a fact if you had a handgun it would protect your family. Citizens do not need an AR-15, bump stocks, or automatic weapons of any sorts. Sure it is our second amendment rights-
2602 2018-05-30 11:44:21 if they played the way they did during some of their losers matches I could see them taking it easily over Kels and Elegant. Mistake kept the opponent to himself too much so they survived for way too long. Leo could've finished their stocks more consistently and early than Bayo.

2616 2018-05-30 11:39:14 Ban bump-stocks NOW!
2617 2018-05-30 11:38:24 Banning bump stocks is a first small step, but a necessary step. There is zero value in allowing them beyond creating revenue for an industry which has zero regard for human life. 

I’ve left my comment.
2618 2018-05-30 11:38:23 Ban bump-stocks!
2619 2018-05-30 11:37:32 BAN BUMP STOCKS!
2620 2018-05-30 11:37:15 I already did.  Like health care and education I want free bump stocks for every American.   lol

Number actually turned in NJ: 0

Imagine now trying to take people’s guns away
2622 2018-05-30 11:35:51 Tx fee will be extremely important for security once block rewards reduce. Also, people earning less than 2 USD will never invest in BTC (just like they probably don’t own any land/bond/stocks). They will however have the opportunity to earn BTC on L2 or L3 
2623 2018-05-30 11:35:16 get a ban on bump stocks is what he means given the context of the retweet being for #BanBumpStocks

2627 2018-05-30 11:33:34 There's no legitimate purpose for bump stocks. They should be banned.

2635 2018-05-30 11:32:15 If you get a good company cheap enough, then you are paying a lot less for the growth. But I get it that growth stocks have been so hot, why not own them? It's a sure thing. They only go up.

2647 2018-05-30 11:20:19 I've had property spruikers accuse me of "gambling" and "speculating" by investing in stocks. I point out to them that financing companies with my capital makes jobs, skills upgrades, profits and tax income for the country FAR more than investing in a concrete slab.

2652 2018-05-30 11:18:01 Thank you. If my reading is correct therefore, stocks are starting to say "risk on" again. BTc should be rallying in due course....otherwise bad divergence / negative price implication
2653 2018-05-30 11:17:00 Steinhoff taught me the importance of never telling anyone which stocks i believe to be good investments..even if its just small talk.

2659 2018-05-30 11:14:53 One of the things I learned in life from reading newspapers is that INVESTING IN STOCKS COULD BE YOUR GREATEST ACHIEVEMENT, OR YOUR WORST FLOP.

2693 2018-05-30 10:47:27 Well if you like that one, maybe you should consider how the banks allowed a failing trump casino to stay open as long as the Trump name stayed with it. And what does Trump do? He pays him self a hefty wage, sold his stocks publicly, and investors made zero money.

2709 2018-05-30 10:38:26 It does bcoz stocks of Banknifty have highest wieghts in Nifty Index. So you are basically hedging most of your exposure by pair trading them.
2710 2018-05-30 10:37:29 Ridiculous.
And reading stocks is more then line graphs and news letters from firms. It’s reading into the people who back businesses and there companies chooses and movements.

What I see is a man trying to cover up bad coverage at every turn rather then look past it and push.

Most of my stocks are not directly/indirectly related to anything in Italy, yet they dropped. Great buying opportunity indeed!

I get the end game. Just saying the game encourages the players to take advantage of the volatility+quick profit/gamble which in turn drives down the likelihood of currency adoption.

2841 2018-05-30 08:27:48 @SEBI_India so you really exist. Investors are vanishing their hard earn money in the hell stocks like "Manpasand Beverage". 50% value eroded in 3 days. @FinMinIndia please taek some action in such kind of financial "scams". I m sure something unprofessional is going on there.
2842 2018-05-30 08:27:14 If you can't use it to aim at a target, it is not an "arm." It is a toy.

Bump stocks are not allowed in shooting ranges because  the gun cannot be aimed.

It is ONLY useful for two ppl: who don't respect their weapons and think they are toys. And mass killers.

Ban bump stocks.

3207 2018-05-30 03:58:24 I don’t want to take away anyone’s civil rights. I’m a gun owner. I just don’t need an AR-15 to feed my ego, or a zillion bullets or bump stocks. I think it’s a civil right not to get slaughtered at school or church or the movies. Somehow I don’t think crazy ppl should own guns.

3319 2018-05-30 03:04:54 You need to examine your history more closely! The big reason you may recall in 29' was the market crash! The reason for that was that too many people were buying stocks on margin and when it came time for there margin call no one could pay and the market crashed.

3336 2018-05-30 02:57:14 No ones trying to oppress u, we don't want ALL YOUR GUNS, we want sensible gun laws that prohibit the sale of weapons to those who might be mentally unstable, back ground checks and ban military style weapons, bump stocks & high capacity rounds.  Not oppression, it's sensible!

3338 2018-05-30 02:56:58 Global Cues

U.S. stocks tumbled the most in more than a month, joining a global equity selloff sparked by concern Italy’s political woes will destabilise Europe.

The yield on 10-year Treasuries declined 15 basis points to 2.78 percent, reaching the lowest since April 2.

3342 2018-05-30 02:51:43 Very well! You are now invested in the “Chinese equivalent of things” stocks.
3343 2018-05-30 02:49:28 Thank you for the heads up I'm going to order seven one for every day of the week set em up with red dots and bump stocks
3344 2018-05-30 02:49:05 LOL I could not give a crap what you think and I trade in Biotech Stocks, so I answer to nobody. However, it is instructive how the left will attack someones job immediately for an innocuous twitter post. The left is becoming a hate group.
3345 2018-05-30 02:47:04 Nothing to do with Elliot Wave. Stocks down sharply, bonds up. Run to safety as usual. Also the sell off in the Italian bond market resulted in a further bid to Treasuries.

Temporary run in $TLT, lucky timing of the call debit spread.
3346 2018-05-30 02:46:52 Ya he should have sold GM stocks at a loss like you and Harper did.

3348 2018-05-30 02:46:20 Stocks have been stagnant since December. Which means if there isn't growth by end of June it is officially a recession.

3351 2018-05-30 02:44:59 It's why i responded to this thread. 99% of ERC20 tokens are garbage built on hype and false promises like dotcom stocks in 90's. 1st wave were alt-coins. 2nd wave was even-easier-to-create ERC20 tokens followed by ICO craze. Plus, ETH does have major flaws in and of itself.

Most super stocks come from leading groups. 
Most super stocks have great charts BEFORE they break out.
Most super stocks are within 15% of 52 week highs.

3374 2018-05-30 02:31:05 Actually, Disney's stock slid today prior to the Roseanne cancellation. Star Wars fatigue is hurting the stock far more than cancelling Racist Roseanne's show. In addition, Italy's governing crisis and uncertainty over China pushed most stocks lower. That's how markets work, son.
3375 2018-05-30 02:30:26 About 10 years ago a very senior exec at a growth conference spoke about how underwriters trying to win business had pushed IPO pricing to the max and basically made it impossible for investors to make money buying stocks.

3432 2018-05-30 01:58:44 P.S. More of us should have protested that one and we didn’t. So the media companies weren’t worried about their stocks. If we had, she wouldn’t have gotten that Netflix deal, I’m sure of it.

3482 2018-05-30 01:26:32 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA? @realDonaldTrump
3483 2018-05-30 01:25:55 I don’t know anyone who has a problem with banning bump stocks. The issue is that it starts with bump stock ban and ends in confiscation full stop.
3484 2018-05-30 01:25:49 Healthcare companies stocks have quadrupled under the ACA and they still receive billions in subsidies. 
Premiums have passed 140% in some locations. ACA did not prevent insurers from dropping low performing markets. ACA was and is a scam.
3485 2018-05-30 01:25:04 Vlad Jr’s free agency has already been delayed by a year. The only way to push it back further would be to leave him in the minors all of 2018 plus at least two weeks of 2019. That would be deleterious to his development as a hitter.

3543 2018-05-30 00:55:43 Disney stock has been pretty steady & fine for the last decade.  It's had normal fluctuations this year, as it has in the last 5 years. So, not sure where you're getting "not so good".  That's inaccurate as far as stocks go.

3562 2018-05-30 00:47:33 Exactly. Unless you're advocating keeping him in the minors until late April 2019, at which point you are hindering his development as a hitter (and probably getting a grievance from the agent).

3576 2018-05-30 00:43:49 Racial bigotry go straight to the top of ABC starting with Channing Dungey everyone will watch your stocks fall as people contact the companies that will pull their commercials from your network.
3577 2018-05-30 00:43:40 Ban Bump Stocks Now
3578 2018-05-30 00:43:05 @timseymour  Schultz bathroom statement a joke. He & Iger ESPN ruining stocks with liberal bent. Only leftist can stand this approach. Many boycotting these 2 CEOs.
3579 2018-05-30 00:42:57 So you guys are saying dont call him up at all this year or early next year, is that right?
3580 2018-05-30 00:42:34 @realDonaldTrump   Why didn’t you ban bump stocks and raise the gun purchasing age to 21 when you said you were? Are you afraid of the NRA?
3581 2018-05-30 00:42:27 I think you may be confused by Super 2. Only way Jays get him for one more year is if they keep him down until around April 15, 2019.

3583 2018-05-30 00:42:04 David Hogg, you are young and inexperienced. If Donald Trump were a dictator, I'm certain he would ban bump stocks and raise the age to 21.
3584 2018-05-30 00:41:50 yeah. the stocks are looking really nice
3585 2018-05-30 00:41:42 I assume they're referring to Romney saying he supports banning bump stocks? Something the NRA and Pres. Trump supported if memory serves?
3586 2018-05-30 00:41:10 @ABC_Publicity you made a mistake this time that will bury your stocks as more and more people will boycott you because of Channing Dungey own racial bigotry agenda... Have fun!
3587 2018-05-30 00:40:58 I agree. no team that isn't a World Series contender should ever bring up prospects. I think mike trout be in triple a still. what chance have the angels really had in his career? Why are they wasting him for our viewing pleasure?

3593 2018-05-30 00:39:09 Retweeted David Hogg (@davidhogg111):

We should all tweet ”Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?” on every @realDonaldTrump tweet from now on
3594 2018-05-30 00:38:54 Kelly Criterion is optimal when you can calculate your exact edge. Applying it to Stocks or Sports betting where you are estimating your edge on each play is extremly dangerous.

3611 2018-05-30 00:28:36 A total joke. But we love our war stocks in this country.
3612 2018-05-30 00:27:36 This is bullshit. Look at the stock, all media stocks and the time of the announcement in relation to the stock price.
3613 2018-05-30 00:27:30 And if you think his "opinion" doesn't hold the weight of his government position, just remember how his tweet alone have affected stocks.

As President, it's no longer just an "opinion". He doesn't get that luxury. He represents America, the American people, and the government.
3614 2018-05-30 00:27:24 While neither of the Republican candidates think much should be done with regards to gun control at least Romney believes bump stocks should be banned. Kennedy is okay with bump stocks, but he's not okay with me medical marijuana.

I thought he stepped down from commission so he could focus on getting his ass kicked.

3633 2018-05-30 00:20:40 Q about gun violence/gun control. On gun legislation, Romney wants expanded background checks, banning bump stocks, nothing else. Also wants more school security. #utpol

3641 2018-05-30 00:16:23 I have experience trading Stocks & Futures but not Crypto.
My approach would be:

2. To open an Account to trade in DEMO the most liquid one.
3. Practice until profitabe in DEMO.
4. Fund your account.

3654 2018-05-30 00:11:57 Most of the market leading stocks I follow, ie, those that have made strong gains over the last twelve months, actually posted gains today.
3655 2018-05-30 00:10:43 The point that a lot of brokers had the stock to short kind of makes it contrary to our bias. I may be wrong cos I just started studying penny stocks. If something is selling and need to be borrowed, we will probably have a hard time locating the shares.
