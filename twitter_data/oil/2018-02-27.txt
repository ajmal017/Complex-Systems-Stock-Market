1 2018-02-27 23:59:39 今日は午後から天気が荒れるらしいのですが、私の心は朝からムカムカとすでに荒れ狂っております。おはようございます。
2 2018-02-27 23:59:32 I just changed my oil, ima mechanic now
3 2018-02-27 23:59:23 Peanut Oil!
4 2018-02-27 23:59:21 He's a hero in both. On the left, he saved oil workers from a drilling site explosion. On the right, he saved Smallville. My man could be wearing a plastic bread wrap and look just as heroic.
5 2018-02-27 23:59:06 OMG I CAN'T WAIT FOR IT
6 2018-02-27 23:58:45 True! I’ve burned myself worse working in coffee It’s the oil stains I’m worried about Currently soaking the jeans in Oxi Clean
7 2018-02-27 23:58:42 We see it and here it all the time.  Unfortunately many have been fooled by this snake oil salesman DJT and friends.
8 2018-02-27 23:58:28 Sitting next to some guy at Jiffy Lube waiting for my oil change and this dude just keeps making random noises. 
9 2018-02-27 23:58:27 BS. *Speculative* demand is high in Toronto and Vancouver. In Toronto in particular, there were more homes delivered than household formed for the past 5 years. 

Calgary and Regina are oil economies. Credit capacity requires healthy employment.
10 2018-02-27 23:58:08 I'm hoping it's because they have larger fish to dredge in flour and cook in hot oil.
11 2018-02-27 23:57:55 Trust me fam think about it this way. America was in a fuel crisis at the time, they had no oil what. Where’s the oil? The Middle East? Where have they been fighting for years since 9/11? The Middle East. Money it’s all for money don’t be distracted by the terrorist organisations
12 2018-02-27 23:57:49 love me some digital snake oil
13 2018-02-27 23:57:25 I heard you say now you're gonna take a bunch of prescription meds? Cannabis oil and plant based nutrition will reverse all the damage. You should know this. Drs got you scared and in their pocket now. #NoMeds

34 2018-02-27 23:56:46 I wish i could give ahneeka some blacksoap with neem,tea tree oil and activated charcoal. That face is a mess 
#BBNaija
35 2018-02-27 23:56:33 Exactly.  Very sad that we put big oil before the lives of precious Middle Eastern little ones.  #U.S.Terrorism
36 2018-02-27 23:56:31 Of course you don’t. Please put a trump sign on your door so snake oil salespeople know an east mark.
37 2018-02-27 23:56:04 Totally can take those vape oil pens in there . I was hitting mine on pirates of the Caribbean!
38 2018-02-27 23:55:57 そうだね～　TOHOでレイトショーが大半です！　まぁ年に２回程度なんですが…
39 2018-02-27 23:55:45 Super easy: arugula or other greens, bell pepper, cherry tomatoes, beets (roasted or pickled), goat cheese, slice almonds, oil and vinegar. 
Our beets were smoked and curries. Used #harissa olive oil and #Serrano balsamic vinegar.
40 2018-02-27 23:55:41 Oil, Potatoes, Heat?
41 2018-02-27 23:55:33 My dad was shocked I could change my own tire properly  can’t check my oil but I can change my damn tire
42 2018-02-27 23:55:31 I am not a fucking uber! Wanna ride to the store??? That'll be 350 dollars (car note). Oh! You wanna go down the street to your cousin house..that'll be 200 dollars (car insurance). Aaww you wanna go see your sick grandma..that'll be 50 dollars (Oil change, tire rotation, & gas)
43 2018-02-27 23:55:24 Bike is leaking oil . Made my shitty day extra shitty.
44 2018-02-27 23:55:01 skeptics and white "supremacy," are like oil and water
45 2018-02-27 23:54:53 Got out of each of my classes an hour early, changed my oil, got my dirtbike running again for the first time since October, AND got my first win in Fortnite. What a great ass day.
46 2018-02-27 23:54:49 They beat both revenue and earnings estimates. One of the shale producers who can weather the storm in case we go through another low oil price environment.
47 2018-02-27 23:54:47 Tell him there's oil going through the loophole, he will close it yesterday
48 2018-02-27 23:54:42 Osage Indians in Oklahoma we’re murdered for their Oil rights! Fossil fuels are derived from murder and pollutio, scum bags do what scum bags do. Quit using oil & gas ASAP. Crush their existence
49 2018-02-27 23:54:35 Oil
50 2018-02-27 23:54:26 Btw, the tar sands are considered ' dirty oil.' Worse than most other kinds of oil extraction.
51 2018-02-27 23:54:19 *GLOBAL*

*Dow Jones* : 299.24

52 2018-02-27 23:54:12 It's not. But until disintegration of civil society, morality is addressed it is the most effective means of Immediant meaningful action.
53 2018-02-27 23:53:47 And still no funding solution 2 fix PEIA - he just wants national attention taken off low WV severance tax (practically giving our oil & gas away) at 5% while Alaska is 23%. Even Texas is at least 7.5%.
PEIA already had a committee for 14 months with 0 results. #WVStrong
54 2018-02-27 23:53:41 Someone come oil between my cornrows
55 2018-02-27 23:53:41 We just got some new *Rick Simpson Oil 1:1 CBD-THC Ratio*
56 2018-02-27 23:53:32 So I'm excited about getting new tires and an oil change. Does that scream adult life or what?
57 2018-02-27 23:53:31 I think he has allowed all these Russian investigations to go on. He has armed Ukraine. Had military actions in Syria. But most important has allowed oil production to make US # one passing Russia. What kind of sanction is that once exports start. Duh
58 2018-02-27 23:53:15 of course this means lots less $$ spent dealing with incarceration, drug addiction, yada  yada
taking care of people in a society is like changing oil in your car
59 2018-02-27 23:53:11 All this over water, oil, sugar, corn starch, corn vinegar, apple cider vinegar, ginger, wheat and soy

61 2018-02-27 23:53:05 The five virgins without oil in their lamps and the unprofitable servant in Matthew 25, when the Midnight Hour suddenly, unexpectedly hits, and the Great Tribulation begins, shall have to face Satan’s wrath without Divine Protection. -Richard
62 2018-02-27 23:52:54 Assuming he wasn't sent to the Sea, what is SEA? BTW I think you need to be taking more fish sauce and sesame oil in to work.
63 2018-02-27 23:52:29 @Saccone4PA18 So PACman, where is the money flowing from this week? The Oklahoma oil barons? The Russian oligarchs? Inquiring minds want to know!
64 2018-02-27 23:52:10 Early night with eucalyptus oil in the diffuser 
65 2018-02-27 23:52:07 Ha ha ha cleansing oil dia pun  nak jimat punya pasal guna minyak yg dah ada kat muka jelah
66 2018-02-27 23:51:43 China can buy anything here. It has already acquired the Hambantota Port & thousands of acres of land adjacent thereto. The Mattala Airport is also up for sale. The same goes for the Trincomalee oil tank farm #lka
67 2018-02-27 23:51:21 @davidhogg111 Plz don't let huckster @RealAlexJones sucker you. He's naught but snake oil & most of us know that. Debate isn't what he wants. He wants to shout you down. Not that I wouldn't love to see you kick his ass in a debate- it wouldn't be debate.  He can't handle debate
68 2018-02-27 23:51:17 If you aren’t on the coconut oil hype yet, it’s time 
69 2018-02-27 23:51:15 him whining about accurately being called a shit journalist and a snake oil salesman lmaoooo
70 2018-02-27 23:50:58 Also tho, I did blow my first cars motor from not changing the oil cause I wasn't 17 & didn't know any better so I think he's still mad 
71 2018-02-27 23:50:57 i understand w/oil has called for an emergency meeting of the coven..
72 2018-02-27 23:50:52 She’s said she’s exploring raising taxes on the oil corporations. Would you prefer the tax shortfall caused by the  be paid by you?
73 2018-02-27 23:50:50 Where there is Oil and Gas industry, earthquakes are common. As for PNG’s case, this killer earthquake was caused by humans.
74 2018-02-27 23:50:40 Cruz has Big Oil behind himGrassley endorsed Trump along with the farmers —-now they’re all pissed off
75 2018-02-27 23:50:27 Given the structure of the state legislature and how little power it and the state constitution impart to the gov, and given how important oil and gas are to the state I’ll go with governor being less important, but that’s a personal opinion.  Like i said, it’s arguable.
76 2018-02-27 23:50:21 One of the best drivers of the trump “miracle” is the energy industry - oil, natural gas, LNG, refineries, energy infrastructure, and alternative resources - all are driving the current increase in economic activity - private industry at its best !!!
77 2018-02-27 23:50:10 Of course. Always Editing the Nes, those Cazy Propagandists !!!
78 2018-02-27 23:49:55 Yeah I agree, California should make the oil companies pay for their legal fees.
79 2018-02-27 23:49:39 I know you have to be diplomatic but as a Brit I'd just like to ask that 1st we must stop aiding #Saudi's crazed bombing of poor #Yemen & 2nd we shouldn't trade what's left of our integrity for their snake oil. Seriously humanitarian forum? They shld be at   #ICC

82 2018-02-27 23:49:16 I didn’t realize this clay cleanser I’ve been using gets rid of oil.. my skin already dry 
83 2018-02-27 23:49:12 Apparently charcoal is the new oil.
84 2018-02-27 23:49:03 oil is a helluva drug
85 2018-02-27 23:48:55 Did they mention those pesky 3 months off?
86 2018-02-27 23:48:53 You're forgetting all the folks working hard in the Canadian energy sector with alternative energies and the opportunities for all Canadians...not just those sitting on top of an oil patch, in all areas of our economy. #EnoughIsEnough #ActOnClimate #cdnpoli #bcpoli #StopKM
87 2018-02-27 23:48:53 All the sudden lives matter? Baltimore, Chicago have lost THOUSANDS more just in a couple of years. They didn't matter? We see the hypocrisy
88 2018-02-27 23:48:48 First if all weirdo,  I did my eight years for the US so I have no need to pretend. Second common sense to shorten petrol to cover gas and oil on twitter. Third,  you are a moron for thinking clean energy exist. For every 20 miles a Tesla runs = 1 gal of gas in waste.
89 2018-02-27 23:48:33 My biggest regret is putting my face in the sun all the time, I used to put olive oil on it on holiday  Trying to reverse the damage now 
90 2018-02-27 23:48:23 Dawn of a new day and yet burning the mid nite oil 
91 2018-02-27 23:48:07 Has anyone read the absolute nonsense from jacinda when questioned by the bbc when after the usual baby stuff, she was asked some serious questions.  It’s on whale oil
92 2018-02-27 23:47:54 小屋、既にエモい
93 2018-02-27 23:47:48 @GovCanHealth Didn't pay taxes to a bunch of bullies who've sunk me so deep into debt because I won't do their Morphine leaving me with a Jelly Brain. You're an insult to my intelligence, try googling Cannabis oil Extract Bottles from 1850!!! #Genocide #cdnpoli #bcpoli #abpoli
94 2018-02-27 23:47:45 If I had a dollar for every time my dad lectured me about oil changes..
95 2018-02-27 23:47:22 talking to me is like performing a roadside alternator swap with an oil soaked serpentine belt at 2am
96 2018-02-27 23:47:21 Maybe you should do some research on how that actually works before opening your mouth on shit you know nothing about.  Btw, oil bubbles up naturally in the ocean
97 2018-02-27 23:47:19 Don’t think olbas oil is supposed to go in ur ears but here I am
98 2018-02-27 23:47:09 Tony Pennington has given me the opportunity to check graces oil while we are stuck in Spartanburg
99 2018-02-27 23:47:03 Waiting for a conservative. ANY conservative to step up and say what they plan to do about our oil and gas industry and the U.S. (and any other foreign) $$ funding the protest movement in our country.
100 2018-02-27 23:46:59 But you aren't choosing the environment if you let all this other commercial traffic continue, including existing oil tankers. You just want to feel good when your decision to let any traffic of this nature ruins the ocean anyway.
101 2018-02-27 23:46:44 Pure badness. The remaining oil leaked into his garden and it all has to be dug up. Insurance company has to sort it out now
102 2018-02-27 23:46:41 Sure he sounded like a ‘snake oil salesman’.... disappointing, even from this distance! But the level of vitriol? Time for everyone to take a deep breath and, for now at least, just get on with doing what they believe the science tells them.
103 2018-02-27 23:46:36 
104 2018-02-27 23:46:32 SOMEBODY FIX CUSTOMER SERVICE IN TRINIDAD....MAN CANNOT SURVIVE ON OIL AND GAS ALONE!!!
105 2018-02-27 23:46:20 I OIL THIS BAD BOY UP ALL DAY EVERYDAY AND I STILL AM LIKE SHREDDED  I’m def gonna try bio oil tho bc so many ppl have suggested it!! I use lots of lush massage bars, but I’m still open to other things to see if they’ll prevent more
106 2018-02-27 23:46:18 I am guessing if we had a way to get Alberta oil to international markets that some of these shortages would be eased.  Alas, this government is determined to keep oil and gas in the ground - insanity.
107 2018-02-27 23:46:08 i had to mix oil with my foundation today bc my face was a little too dry for it to go on right i cannot imagine what people with dry skin go through god fuckin bless yall
108 2018-02-27 23:45:45 why why why why why why why why why why why. Why. Why. Let's take dynamically compressed spoken word recorded in a booth (good source material that sounds good on any format, even AM radio) and then record it onto an incredibly inconvenient disc made out of OIL
109 2018-02-27 23:45:44 I be trying man, I be so busy I literally stay on the go. I keep my oil changed tho
110 2018-02-27 23:45:43 Use coconut oil or make up wipes. 
111 2018-02-27 23:45:28 Discovered the reason I don't need to stir this natural "peanut butter spread": the miracle of palm oil. I'd rather not contribute to the death of more orangutans. I can stir my own natural peanut butter. #PalmOil
112 2018-02-27 23:45:23 What you did for Toronto to clean chemical pollution ( plastic,air,oil, clothes,food
113 2018-02-27 23:45:12 @DramaFollower All this food talk reminds me, I meant to ask you have you ever tried butter-flavored olive oil? Your husband can't have butter anymore right?
114 2018-02-27 23:45:12 Check your Transmission oil this weekend.
115 2018-02-27 23:45:08 Bears gather in numbers after crude oil once again glides down the slippery slope.

119 2018-02-27 23:44:33 .@FLGovScott might want to reconsider off coast oil production if he wants to pay for his school safty plan

Raw emotion doesn’t pay the tab as we dance into the #lefts party
120 2018-02-27 23:44:30 LMAO!!!!.. No everything Dem dry use committee look ...how much is allocated to the committee to facilitate their proper operation.....or better yet "oil their wheels"
121 2018-02-27 23:44:17 I thought he’d make an announcement. Going back later to pour out some olive oil out front. #Respect

125 2018-02-27 23:43:51 It's about saying NO to oil tankers and oil spills in our waters, that's it! Explore other avenues for your oil, we're not going to allow an increase to port for this oil from here! #EnoughIsEnough #ActOnClimate #cdnpoli #bcpoli #StopKM #WaterIsLife
126 2018-02-27 23:43:43 If only India had loaned $1billion to Mongolia to build the an oil refinery in country along with oil pipelines & associated infrastructure & if state owned Engineers India Ltd had been planning feasibility with construction to start in Q2.. no wait, that's all happening! #MATD

134 2018-02-27 23:41:57 I deal with PTSD which causes intense anxiety. Most people don't realize, but I sure do. I highly recommend sage. You can do smudging, candles, essential oil etc. Focus on your breathing. (May sound ridiculous, but it significantly helps me!) Best of luck 
135 2018-02-27 23:41:35 Y’all pay $50 for an oil change but I just did my own
136 2018-02-27 23:41:30 Tell her I got my oil and windshield wipers changed as well as a tire check for $85 today
137 2018-02-27 23:41:23 He had tuberculosis, had been dying for a while. Could be US cottonseed oil as US had big influence there at that time.
138 2018-02-27 23:41:22 Good questions, @harrier26. I've already committed to not taking money from corporations and their PACs. The healthcare giants and defense industry didn't come up in this tweet because @NoFossilMoney is specifically focused on oil, gas, and coal.
139 2018-02-27 23:41:22 Try switching your washer from "Hot" to "Warm." If everyone in the US did this, it could save ~100,000 barrels of oil a day!

144 2018-02-27 23:40:17 油を固めて捨てるの面倒でしょう？僕に渡してくれたらいいよ。あ、固めて渡してくれてもいいよ。
145 2018-02-27 23:40:16 We don't need oil silly .... do try better next time 
146 2018-02-27 23:40:08 Yes, but also rigid adherence to low and stable inflation. Short run effect of positive demand shock will be to raise inflation, but you have to accommodate that to get to the longer term effect of supply adjustment. Kinda of like oil market.
147 2018-02-27 23:40:03 That's NOT what we want! Raise the oil and gas severance tax and fund PEIA!
148 2018-02-27 23:39:51 Far, far better to give it away to gas, oil and mining interests, ala Ryan Zinke.
149 2018-02-27 23:39:35 The unpaid cost of oil continues to rise, along with the tide, when will we learn.
150 2018-02-27 23:39:28 What is 'sustainable' palm oil? We did without it for years. Four crops a year of palm oil = cheap. One crop of rapeseed/olive etc more expensive. Cut down rain forests because we want cheap biscuits. We don't live there. Why care? Pure economics. Don't buy anything with palm oil
151 2018-02-27 23:39:27 Now I can’t pick up this motherfucking car until tomorrow. ooooooooh I’m either getting free oil changes and car washes for a year or I will cut a bitch tomorrow 
152 2018-02-27 23:39:27 You may remember Midnight Oil's 'Beds Are Burning'. I always understood 'Birds are borning'. Also you can see birds in the video clip, but not a single bed.
153 2018-02-27 23:39:21 He won’t bite the hand that feeds him!  There’s more than just simple election collusion going on here. Drug and oil cartel involvement seems more likely.
154 2018-02-27 23:39:17 @TonightShowTV3 Sammy Wilson says why pay money into EU well what about their farming subsidy’s and 2 what about Scotland who with their oil and gas propped up the UK Government should Scotland also leave The UK with the same argument that UK leaves EU
155 2018-02-27 23:39:15 No - no - I hate olives on their own, only as olive oil - how on earth do yo include limes, no one just *eats* a lime - and yes I am just eating a tomato. Stepyogameup.
156 2018-02-27 23:39:04 *Put more oil on the kart* Heh HEH heh #Dingobot
157 2018-02-27 23:38:38 Getting my oil changed and just remembered I left my debit cards at home 
158 2018-02-27 23:38:20 William Landers, a money manager who oversees $2.2 billion at BlackRock, told Bloomberg that he entered the year with a 'pretty big overweight' in Brazil." He sees potential in the mining, oil and financial industries.  Brazil materials stocks have been by far the biggest gainers
159 2018-02-27 23:38:18 Again dream on, "Hold the sanctions, give us back that Connecticut property, change the law so we can drill on the Artic for oil and do not forget to knee in front of me tonight after the Summit" that is more like it, naïve.
160 2018-02-27 23:38:13 Sometimes a coconut oil bath really can change your bad mood into a good mood
161 2018-02-27 23:38:10 Qq Adam, how can you be long DXY, short oil, and long GLD?
162 2018-02-27 23:37:54 Guy it has passed
163 2018-02-27 23:37:50 Which to cut off first. Electricity, oil or gas? Might just stick to the Whisky, Gin or water. Salmon, Oysters or sea trout. Lamb, Beef or Venison? Beano, Dandy comics or video games? Jet engines, buses or ships? Micro satellites, avionics or microelectronics? Should I go on?
164 2018-02-27 23:37:49 Ironic that you would call @infowars vitamins and herbs snake oil when most of the the school shooters in the past have been on Big Pharma anti-depressants.
165 2018-02-27 23:37:16 my mom is cooking w like coconut oil(?) and it doesn't smell good lol
166 2018-02-27 23:37:07 @WCCO that extra long “Bags Under the Eyes” commercial you run only during the news is appalling! You’re trying to pass off snake oil as a news piece! Taking advantage of the elderly is sickening. #fakingthenews #YoureTheWorst
167 2018-02-27 23:37:04 And, finally this: sanctions against Russia don't amount to anything. With their control over the oil spigot in Europe, sanctions have little impact. They're not isolated enough for sanctions to cause them pain.
168 2018-02-27 23:37:02 Long bow to blame seed oils for his death. Might have been olive oil ....... but whatever oil you might have used in those days (bar coconut), given it was Samoa and with sea travel prevailing, it may well have been rancid.
169 2018-02-27 23:36:31 In Alberta, you people only concern yourselves with OIL. Dirty oil, at all costs. Today, more and more jobs are in green energy. Peak oil *is* a reality. Soon it'll all be gone. Then you'll be burning dead trees to keep warm in your cave.
170 2018-02-27 23:36:26 Handmade on site.  All natural ingredients.  No additives, preservatives, palm oil, colourings.  Come and sample for yourselves!!
171 2018-02-27 23:36:22 Someone needs to teach me not to use olbas oil like its magic and gonna do anything but make my nose and ears hurt when I use too much
172 2018-02-27 23:36:21 Thank you! It has pepers, mushrooms and rice (: with a little bit of oil (nothing special but yeah)
173 2018-02-27 23:36:19 Sometimes I get those spur of the moment feelings of sadness which sucks :/ 
I have too much going on in my head
174 2018-02-27 23:36:11 Oh man there's balsamic here too. I already do jimmy johns day olds with balsamic and the really good tj olive oil and parmesan. Unsweetened dark chocolate is barely an adjustment to that winning formula
175 2018-02-27 23:35:34 inject coconut oil into your heart. fucking. jam it in there. fuck. fucking. bathe in it. stick your face in it. fucking. coconut oil RAW
176 2018-02-27 23:35:27 LOL ! " We are illegally in Syria, but it's o.k
because we don't like Iran"
War profiteers invading a country with jihadists to help
Israel, & their oil investors to steal land & oil from Syria,
& trying to remove Assad! @POTUS @realDonaldTrump 
AMERICA FIRST NOT MORE INVASIONS!
177 2018-02-27 23:35:11 I hate radioactive fracking pipelines.  Most of the contaminated radioactive oil is being sold to other countries to make PLASTICS, which end up in our oceans!
178 2018-02-27 23:35:06 NEW ACDelco Advantage Oil Filters - built to support routine maintenance - EVEN Pleating!
179 2018-02-27 23:35:00 Oh, but you do sell snake oil.
180 2018-02-27 23:34:42 I really gotta get outta being such a girl when it comes to my car. I don't do nothing but get oil changes
181 2018-02-27 23:34:32 I have any Italian friends living in Montreal. Pizza available in supermarkets or at their house is essentially flatbread with tomato sauce and olive oil. It is an appetizer or side dish. USA transforms many things.
182 2018-02-27 23:34:15 For those who may not know, the Railroad Commission is a hugely powerful post, regulates oil and gas.
183 2018-02-27 23:34:14 CAPP's Ben Brunnen says federal budget commits to explore implications of US tax reforms on energy sector and recognises some of the risks of widening differentials. But he says there’s "no real direct commitment to strengthening the oil and gas sector in Canada.” #yyc #yeg
184 2018-02-27 23:34:10 Brought my car to the Subaru Dealer for an oil change AND BOY OH BOY DO I HATE BRINGING MY CAR IN FOR ANYTHING.
185 2018-02-27 23:34:09 Yet another oil find in Guyana!

188 2018-02-27 23:33:55 Haven’t done my brows in like a week because I want them to get thicker and darker with a special oil and that shit is working! #yas
189 2018-02-27 23:33:33 KAI always cooks really spicy curry with a lot of chili oil to it... It BURNS!;;
190 2018-02-27 23:33:23 My girls y’all want a confidence booster just go get your oil changed
191 2018-02-27 23:33:02 Lol its a banter season
192 2018-02-27 23:33:00 Does our government only pretend to care about genocide in countries with oil?  Or is it a skin tone thing?
193 2018-02-27 23:32:43 That hair oil got my pillow smelling like a fresh breath mint lol
194 2018-02-27 23:32:32 I can appreciate the novelty of the “What’s Your TRUE Hogwarts House” bath bomb. But I don’t need a clump of coconut oil and Epsom salts to tell me I’m a Slytherin. Hiss hiss, bitch 
195 2018-02-27 23:32:31 85% of America's global economy is powered by oil & gas & coal. Our #RFID tags are made to tolerate the harsh conditions of these fields.
196 2018-02-27 23:32:05 I wear coconut perfume because it reminds me of tanning oil, which reminds me of summer, which makes the heart a little happier
197 2018-02-27 23:32:01 Then how they can get oil? All are equally killer of syria its war of Oil.
198 2018-02-27 23:31:56 Guy you dey use glo? Something that happened last year, na now you dey post, Wheldon

200 2018-02-27 23:31:46 And thanks to Thatcher and all the selloffs of national assets, there's little chance that England will revert to their commonwealth "glory days" anytime soon. Oil has been propping up the pound for decades.
201 2018-02-27 23:31:22 Jose has a club that needs to run like a business not a toy like city oil money... to loaned money 2 buy a club who spreads losses through other sister clubs jose is better than moyes van gaal  hhhmmm 2 thropies 1st yr did pep no but he tops his squad up gets an injury buys 1more
202 2018-02-27 23:31:13 Think they just wear them.
203 2018-02-27 23:31:09 I hope you don’t lose followers. Media should be instrumental in leading the way to uncover&solve the suffering caused by immoral for-money practices.Flint,guns, & the mining,oil,&chemical disasters drop out of media drama,though the immoral practices& the suffering&deaths go on.
204 2018-02-27 23:31:04 Imagine joining the US army and risking your life and killing people just to get some oil and stop communism lmao as if
205 2018-02-27 23:30:48 india text me earlier about getting food the bitch ain’t hit me back, corey ass still getting a oil change, my stomach touching my back boy fuck.

208 2018-02-27 23:30:36 My way to make Chicken #Vindaloo
1. Buy Chicken Tikka Masala from Indian restaurant
2. Heat coconut oil in large saucepan
3. Add onion, skallion, garlic and 4 habaneros (with seeds) all finely chopped
4. Add paprika to darken 
et voilà   Chicken Vindaloo!
209 2018-02-27 23:30:30 He's also the ONLY U.S. Senator to vote against an amendment declaring that climate change is real. Might have something to do with the $200,000+ he's received from big oil! No wonder you support him.
210 2018-02-27 23:30:17 Moral of today: always look presentable even if you’re just going grocery shopping after getting an oil change on an already emotional bc you might run into your ex’s mom and start crying so you might as well look ~hot~ while she watches you do that in the bread aisle
211 2018-02-27 23:30:15 oil free?
212 2018-02-27 23:29:22 I got some of that Rick and Marty Szechuan sauce. It’s like all their other sauces but with sesame oil. It’s okay?
213 2018-02-27 23:29:16 Your choice, so congrats. P
214 2018-02-27 23:29:11 So you’re saying taking an SUV is bad but... oil is good? What is your logic here? We all absolutely know that your industry is responsible for global warming. Exxon-Mobil knew about it in the 1970s and said nothing. Please go fuck yourself.
215 2018-02-27 23:28:57   

But I gotta get an oil change next week & the dealership is down the street from Rosako’s
216 2018-02-27 23:28:50 How much oil do we use? Trucking, Rail, Transit, Personal Cars and Trucks, Diesel Generators, and misc. Produce that for ourselves. Crazy right?
217 2018-02-27 23:28:50 #NATO #UN colluded & created/funded/armed ISIS to destroy Syria/Iraq/Libya & usurp its oil assets. @PutinRF_Eng called bluff & caught #NATO with its pants down!

218 2018-02-27 23:28:43 حتى انا اضحك عليهم
219 2018-02-27 23:28:31 it’s cool being a girl cause sometimes i’ll get my food for free or a random discount on an oil change or something but then it’s not cool cause i’m scared to walk anywhere alone or smile too big at a stranger or even look over when i feel a guy looking at me at a red light
220 2018-02-27 23:28:27 It's "organic" and made in coconut oil but the sodium is 330? GFTO. That's horrible.
221 2018-02-27 23:28:16 Coconut oil better for you #facts
222 2018-02-27 23:28:13 My back and shoulders are still killing as much as they were this morning. I kind of want to try my new CBD oil, but past experiences tell me not to try new things before going to bed. So I'm just going to take a diazepam instead.
223 2018-02-27 23:28:12 I am all for seeing Alex Jones getting wrecked by a teenager on Twitter with no time for his snake oil bullshit.
224 2018-02-27 23:28:10 Bit of premature oil explosion 
225 2018-02-27 23:28:04 Goldman Sachs commodities index sucks.  Take a look at the composition- you might as well just buy oil.

Check out Rogers International Commodity Index (Created by Jim Rogers)
226 2018-02-27 23:27:54 Ha'an. You guys can't take a simple banter again?
227 2018-02-27 23:27:43 Yea dream on, "Hold the sanctions, give us back that Connecticut property, change the law so we can drill on the Artic for oil and do not forget to knee in front of me tonight after the Summit" that is more like it, naïve.
228 2018-02-27 23:27:33 See how it works is this,PO in Scotland is SLABber,(SLABber hate #themessennpee), SLABber take their orders from UK Labour, UK Labour loves the Union, (as we've tons o Oil), so anything to scupper themessennpee is a goer.
Whilst Welsh PO is a human being protecting her country.
229 2018-02-27 23:27:13 Sad but true. Tbf they were not the only american company to do this: IBM and Standard Oil were both involved in business with Nazi Germany.
230 2018-02-27 23:26:55 Maoist Kurds are against Assad. The ones who actually get help from the U.S. The ones who effectively control Northeast of Syria with its oil and nat. gas fields. The good guys.
231 2018-02-27 23:26:27 USA has perpetrated a genocide against native indians, killed, tortured, abused millions during slave trade; and how many killed during wars for oil and power in Indochine, Vietnam, Irak, Afghanistan; how about supplying means in war in Angola and South-America? Shut up!
232 2018-02-27 23:26:26 I'm gonna give u a fact. Scotland doesn't need England. But England NEEDS Scottish oil. England cannot afford Brexit and then losing Scotland. Its GDP wouldn't be able to cope. Not opinion, fact.
233 2018-02-27 23:25:50 Remember: Global oil flows are not just necessities of technicality...they are political alliances as well ..firmly rooted since 1930's, again in the 1970's ...good luck on changing that
234 2018-02-27 23:25:46 Dude! MCT Oil
235 2018-02-27 23:25:33 I can't understand people who just put themselves out there without establishing emotional connections. Like wouldn't you feel like shit afterwards? Might just be me but oof I could never do that.
236 2018-02-27 23:25:20 2. Trump sanctioned PDVSA for corruption and yet do not prohibit the purchase of oil from Vzla. We actually buy significant amounts of WTI crude oil and naphthas to be used as diluents in the processing of extra-heavy crude from the Orinoco belt (to pay off debts to China)

249 2018-02-27 23:23:39 @chigrl I could be wrong, but I don't see fracking oil as a panacea to "independence." The depletion rates on those wells are quite steep on the downside.
250 2018-02-27 23:23:38 The world isn't decoupling.  The world is increasingly saying "Dear US, we love you, but we don't want to fund your weapons or entitlements anymore.  BA aircraft, oil, F-35's, prize real estate, gold...we love all that stuff.  We'll trade for that stuff.  But no more IOUs."
251 2018-02-27 23:23:29 Sure pal no problem, and not just trucks, how about oil, gas, power, fish? Oh, and whisky.We have other markets within the EU. Get a life.

285 2018-02-27 23:18:45 I did ‘adulting’ today. Post Office, bank and an oil change and tube up. That’s my ‘adulting’ quota for the month.
286 2018-02-27 23:18:44 I can’t wait to try the new GOLD ECO styler gel. It comes with olive oil, shea butter, black castor oil + flaxseed. YES! A natural haired girl’s dream!
287 2018-02-27 23:18:34 Thanks so much! I start everything with microscopic crumbs. You ingested this oil, right? It wasn't topical. I'm in Washington State and have access to a lot.
288 2018-02-27 23:18:31 And, Big Oil already has access to more than enough fossil fuels to destroy the planet.   :-(

With Petro Matad they can produce the Oil & feed into their petroleum business.. so thats offtake sorted & satisfies Mongolian energy independence goal

What were you saying about being dependent?
306 2018-02-27 23:15:41 Trump is clued in about the Saudi Arabia plan to move off of oil.  It's why his administration is currently discussing the sell of nuclear reactors. SA will go off of oil and onto nuclear power.

308 2018-02-27 23:15:13 1/ It's a complex scent. I'd rather not go into it. I do like the smell of gun oil. Also, herbs, but that's more to do with the more hands-on thing I do with craft. Also, cinnamon.

311 2018-02-27 23:14:41 I find it problematic how indifferent you are to the thought of 2000 tonnes of heavy oil or diesel fuel being dumped into the ocean. What the heck man; I thought you cared about the coastal waters?

It never pays to meet your heroes, especially the environmental ones. :(

319 2018-02-27 23:13:20 We have our own oil and gas... harder to reach but much of it not explored.., Also, with scotland off our backs... we can actually think about ourselves as a free nation and our place in the world.

Scottish yoons are a burden on both.
Also, it wont be that easy... believe that
320 2018-02-27 23:13:02 Nothing like it. Red Pilling the masses.
321 2018-02-27 23:12:47 I have to go upstairs to my flat. But I legitimately thinks it’s warmer in my car than my living room, which has nothing but an oil filled heater.. 
322 2018-02-27 23:12:45 Scotland has the oil and gas resources
England does not
Scots will be far better off
England will not
323 2018-02-27 23:12:39 The majority (70%) of KSA imports into PADD3 is Arab Light, with the balance predominantly AM.  The average API of KSA imports has been 31.4 over the past 3 years.  Motiva imports AL for its lube base stock, since its former partner, Shell, has a massive share of US motor oil mkt
324 2018-02-27 23:12:27 Now i got CBD oil with 8-10% THC, for strong pains like Cancer.. You can still have CBD without more than 0,1% THC, for psycological problems. 
Come to Denmark Copenhagen Christania, Since it's illegal with THC here still, but a webpage is under construction..
325 2018-02-27 23:12:19 You actually want the Scottish people to trust U.K. gov with our wealth any longer, the same UK Government that “discovered” an extra £15 billion or so had been missing from Scotland’s oil revenue over the past few years.
326 2018-02-27 23:12:18 So you will charge dirty oil for destroying ANWAR?  More #GOPHypocrisy from a Sen w a big ZERO for keeping our air & water clean for our kids.
327 2018-02-27 23:12:11 Sorry but what does this mean? That Scotland isn't running out of oil & is in fact producing more than whole of uk needs? Or is there more to it than that? Sorry if I'm being thick 
328 2018-02-27 23:12:05 If a soft shell taco is a sandwich then a hard shell is too. You wouldn’t say toasted bread (which also alters texture) doesn’t make a sandwich. Applying a little extra heat by oil is hardly different than adding a little more heat by grill, griddle or air.
329 2018-02-27 23:12:03 I like Noodle Bowl inno. But u see that oil??? Yeah that kinda messes it up for me. 6/10

339 2018-02-27 23:10:27 some people, myself included, view the NRA a business lobby like oil and pharmaceuticals. They lobby to make money + raise profit for the people at the top like gun makers. So businesses are making a political statement by hitting them in the money.

342 2018-02-27 23:10:09 All while the largest mosque in North America is built in Fort Mac.

I can only suppose that different people have different visions for Alberta oil, and that there is much play behind the curtains. 

It is clear, that monkey business, possible crime & treason are involved.

345 2018-02-27 23:10:04 Oh yeah i overfilled the oil once....yup............. ....
346 2018-02-27 23:09:42 It's about delivering oil to refineries on the coast for refining. Anything else is a distraction.
347 2018-02-27 23:09:40 Haven’t tried much of their products but I’m p sure the cold-pressed rose hip seed oil saved my skin and helped with scarring and stuff + I use it overnight (after moisturiser) and it makes my skin super soft the next day

419 2018-02-27 23:00:53 Broke a fingernail while changing my own oil and headlight bulbs. So I went ahead and broke the 9 others.

All they do is get in the way, anyway. 
420 2018-02-27 23:00:49 global oil flows..hold on will post a chart...everyone has "deals" with everyone...it isn't just purely technically motivated...most oil alliance are politically motivated as well.. so you have to factor that in
421 2018-02-27 23:00:46 Finally got an oil change for my car. Gonna drop the Envoy off next, then they’re both getting a car wash. 
422 2018-02-27 23:00:46 Ooooh I HAVE roasted carrots in my slow cooker but it takes a considerable amount of oil. Heat oil on high til sizzly. Pop carrot in. Lid. Cook. Turn occasionally. Reduce heat when brown on the outside. Cook on low. Done. Not tried spuds, they'd need a parboil and a shake...
423 2018-02-27 23:00:44 OIL DIFF: 3.64 -> 3.78
424 2018-02-27 23:00:35 Saudis must have financial problems. I guess that cheap oil price wasn't such a good idea after all.
425 2018-02-27 23:00:12 I've tried every oil and I haven't overplucked since 1997. I have a perfect shape but sooo thin

429 2018-02-27 22:59:44 So you're fine with traffic, but at a reduced volume? Weird.

Basically, it seems like you think it's ok for boats to crash and dump oil or other pollutants into the water, you just want it seven times less often.
430 2018-02-27 22:59:37 Houma, LA. Where all the dopey ass, “oil field trash”, morons don’t understand the concept at all of why people protest pipelines. I hope y’all all choke.
431 2018-02-27 22:59:24 I swear I’ve tried it all minus castor oil lmao 
432 2018-02-27 22:59:07 As I explain in Oil Fall, climate folks will care most about the big numbers on the right side of the chart after 2030. But auto and oil industries need to care now, right now, about those seemingly small numbers dead ahead.

435 2018-02-27 22:58:57 In this case, I'd suggest oil cleansing or micellar water. I've heard great things about the Simple brand and Garnier MWs for cleansing. And if your skin tolerates clays, I'd do a mild clay every few days to exfoliate.

440 2018-02-27 22:58:21 What is "the real issue" Jezza?  And when will you explain how Theresa 'n' Jeremy's Glorious New Brexit Britain is going to be funded, what's going to replace the EU subsidies, etc - obviously they don't need Scottish oil coz that''s worthless.  So where's the money coming from?
441 2018-02-27 22:58:21 Young man IS. NOT. PLAYING.  These old snake oil salesmen better watch it...he will roast that A$$.

443 2018-02-27 22:58:11 Ok, so you guys know I recently tried Digestzen Essential Oil for trying new foods. It worked so well I just started using it today, along with Cleary Sage Essential Oil, for PMS. Now I don't know about you, but these two oils have kept the witch in check today
444 2018-02-27 22:57:58 You will all sail through sisters,its d climax,Allah will see you through, can't wait to address you as Docs.

446 2018-02-27 22:57:31 I felt like such an adult today. 
Got my oil done, wheels aligned & my registration sticker. Gave Pepper some TLC.
447 2018-02-27 22:57:28 First the oil company hates us and wants to run us off, then they love us, and now they’re gonna pay us drive time on top of our hourly and per diem. I think we’re gonna get along just fine

451 2018-02-27 22:57:13 And whicg facts, I must ask? Do you even have clue how much Nigeria earned from Crude Oil sales from 1999 - 2015? How much of it was saved and how much went to Federal, State & Local.Govts? You simpletons just believe any thrash you are fed. Do your research. Okay?
452 2018-02-27 22:57:11 My dad wouldn't let any of us, including my 2 sisters, get our Driver's licenses unless we could check the oil in the engine, add a quart if necessary, and change a tire.

468 2018-02-27 22:54:41 El nake oil no hace nada, pero lo promocionaban antes como la cura de todo. Alex Jones vende cosas en Infowars que prometen pero no hacen nada.
469 2018-02-27 22:54:38 I appreciate all you do for our environment, but does this mean you will work to protect Colorado from oil/gas/fracking if you become governor even if it costs you $$?  It's time to move on to sustainable energy, really.
470 2018-02-27 22:54:37 But the picture in the meme is not an oil sands site.

474 2018-02-27 22:53:59 I'm so happy we have a Potus that uses common sense plus business acuity to reverse America's fortunes to the better & so quickly! Texas is exporting oil to Saudi!
475 2018-02-27 22:53:56 Shows how easily-conned they are.
Remind me: where did the original snake oil salesmen appear? A dishonorable tradition well-maintained by the current  president.
476 2018-02-27 22:53:48 Apparently the creator of Vero is a horrible person who destroyed an oil company in the Philippines and stranded thousand of their people. I gotta do some research into it

“IM OLIVE OIL”~Neon
484 2018-02-27 22:53:09 Some people started naming me "油田希夢" (yudenkimu) which the first 2 kanjis means "oil field" while the other one runs around.
485 2018-02-27 22:52:58 Find a nice planet, the kind that would be attractive to the rich. Build an Orion nuclear pulse rocket, send all the oil tycoons, oligarchs, bankers and corrupt leaders there and we get rid of all the nuclear weapons and the parasitic elite in one go!
486 2018-02-27 22:52:50 My SIL has fibro and gets relief with hemp oil, but during the pain mgmt. drug testing, it shows as positive, which is assinine. So, she lives in pain. It's horrible.
487 2018-02-27 22:52:31 To be fair, they do offer a list of possible lower sugar substitutions - although we opted for coconut oil and golden syrup this time 
488 2018-02-27 22:52:11 Put too much baby oil gel on my feet, now my slides sliding 
489 2018-02-27 22:52:11 Sources: No exit or entrance wound, robots leak oil, not blood. Dress unstained almost as if the pool was there and she willingly laid down in it. Facial wound not mentionedin this "death report". She even using a stunt double Actor in 3rd photo isn't even her (overweight)
490 2018-02-27 22:52:10 If they find a way to take tylenol so they can make money on whatever snake oil they are peddling then yes, they would probably try.  I mean they are going after Immodium for god's sake!  Who the heck wants to purposefully get constipated?  For a high?  Puuullllleeeeezzzzzeee
491 2018-02-27 22:51:59 We have enough oil to last 100 years in America. Finally we have a leader willing to allow America to prosper and not be at mercy of Saudi/Russian oil. Great Job Mr. President.
492 2018-02-27 22:51:48 Traders, a fair momentum shift last night, one day event or short term change? 
#USD surged knocking majors lower, #Oil saw solid selling, #Stocks buckled, the #ASX200 has a strong negative lead this morning.

493 2018-02-27 22:51:33 I’m so sorry Tyler! You should try lemon essential oil.
494 2018-02-27 22:51:28 Green Groups don’t protest Quebec & Ontario buying Tanker Oil from Countries with terrible Enviro records. Yet they buy from Saudi Sheiks who treat women poorly & Venezuela’s killer Dictator. How bout free condoms to all Green Groups. No more hypocrites.
495 2018-02-27 22:51:14 What are you suggesting to your conspiracy theory? The proposal is for 7 times the extra oil tankers...you can make it to be about anything you want but when the protests start the stand will be about oil spills and our environment.  #EnoughIsEnough #ActOnClimate #bcpoli
496 2018-02-27 22:50:55 Coconut oil changed my life.
497 2018-02-27 22:50:36 Really heavily hunted (they were popular whaling targets due to high oil content - they were the "right" whales to catch), lots of human conflict in their range. Takes a long time for pops to recover for any large mammal. Still not back to prewhaling numbers for most species.
498 2018-02-27 22:50:34 Oh the smells of weed and Patchouli oil must be pungent. 
499 2018-02-27 22:50:26 Perhaps Exxon Valdez. They're still dealing with that but Exxon is OK. Yes. Oil spills happen. It's a fact of life as long as we have a fossil fuel based economy.
500 2018-02-27 22:50:13 Oil, gas, and coal industries produce 3.5 billion tons of carbon dioxide each year. We must switch to clean energy. A Richards presidency would ensure that no oil, gas, and coal workers are left jobless. Dedicated to creating jobs, especially in clean energy. #malcolmgov
501 2018-02-27 22:50:13 I am starting to branch off into forex as well. Have been keeping up with charts on TV besides all my crypto watch lists. Oil, and gold, do you have any tips of tricks or am I buying something that’s completely fucking useless
502 2018-02-27 22:50:13 Very. I use Pure spread but when I want buttery butter I mix it vigorously with good oil, about 4:1 butter/oil ratio, and generous with the salt.
503 2018-02-27 22:50:03 Does that mean you were intending on taking a child's life?

521 2018-02-27 22:45:45 Any pro pipeline lobbying is at least done with their own money and there arguments based on factual science. The 'environmental' movement is using US protectionist oil money and base their arguments on fear.

523 2018-02-27 22:45:18 Did you know?: Australian Aborigines used emu oil for their skin in oder to moisturize back in history, which they made from a pad of fat from the emu's back.
524 2018-02-27 22:45:15 Check your Engine oil this Sunday.
525 2018-02-27 22:45:05 Don't be misled Canada. Their actions speak differently than their words. They subsidize the oil industry, promote the tarsands and approve #KinderMorgan. #climatechange action is deferred until some far off time in the future.

526 2018-02-27 22:44:59 He is a snake oil salesman though ^^
527 2018-02-27 22:44:53 Some still do not understand the difference between making money from oil instead of making oil from money. Most of these E&P's could double their profits by holding production steady. Instead, they spend more, to earn less. Like marathoners trying to run 26 4 minute miles.

546 2018-02-27 22:42:43 So it's okay for Hogg to sell CNN's "snake oil" and defame and insult another because poor little boy Hogg doesn't like him? It's the kind of thing that gets you sued

548 2018-02-27 22:42:28 Answer 1. If your foundation contains oil, and your foundation goes patchy, this is because your natural skin oil is mixing with the foundation oil and it’s slipping off. You need oil free foundation in this case #womensinspire #asktheexpert #EthicalMakeup

565 2018-02-27 22:38:36 And is a really bad dude. I hope you feel better Colton have you tried aloe gel? Coconut oil may also help? Sorry to hear this.
566 2018-02-27 22:38:18 You never built the wall the romans did. Another item that wasnt yoursnyou claim was. All that aside. Opac have just declared the uk as the next oil reserves provider.
567 2018-02-27 22:38:16 I rotate where I get my car’s oil changed so that I can get the cheapest price and the longer you wait with certain places, the more coupons you get. I’m cheap and I know it.
568 2018-02-27 22:38:11 Still no comment on the dams eh? Well, let's play... you are in Quebec, you brag about hydro power and cut down Alberta for its dirty oil. Didn't Quebec borrow from Alberta's heritage fund to build said dam? Money generated by Suncor, Syncrude among others. You Sir are Special
569 2018-02-27 22:38:06 Jeez- will she sauté with olive oil or just eat it like sushi?
570 2018-02-27 22:37:53 Mis matched leave out is a heinous crime and no moisturiser with this oily skin for my skin to produce more oil. Not on my watch! We will do scarves and turtle necks
571 2018-02-27 22:37:32 Hot oil treatment & chill tonight.
572 2018-02-27 22:37:30 If you were located near me I’d donate free CBD oil
573 2018-02-27 22:37:10 If you want to burn fat, eat more healthy fat (vegetable sources) and less protein and even less carbohydrates (no refined sugars). Coconut oil is very healthy but butter is not bad, just leave off the bread.
574 2018-02-27 22:36:36 #Pisces &amp #Aquarius are like oil &amp water but you two could make money together
575 2018-02-27 22:36:36 then pot a stop to the AB pipe line into to BC , as that is land that should not be spoled  by AB & US OIL company from TX  !!
576 2018-02-27 22:36:32 What cleaner do you use on a maple fretboard?  Other than a clean towel I'm hesitant to get anything on the fretboard or neck.  Rosewood (oil) is a different story, of course.

584 2018-02-27 22:35:43 Hi @khadeejah_ms
585 2018-02-27 22:35:36 We import Oil from Venezuela (very heavy crude) as the US had/has (depending on what China is doing) the only refineries to refine it. Not all oil is the same.
586 2018-02-27 22:35:34 none. its not in the name of God, but oil. none shouts "khvala bogu!"
587 2018-02-27 22:35:33 Excellent!
588 2018-02-27 22:35:23 Yup, #PalmOil which is the PRIMARY ingredient in Nutella, comes at the expense of Sun Bears, Orangutans, Tigers and Rhinos habitats where palm oil is legally and illegally harvested
589 2018-02-27 22:35:22 Lucas oil Speedway has chicken fried steak sandwich that’s awesome
590 2018-02-27 22:35:17 Donald Trump u will destroy America aswell is the world unless u go eco friendly instead of coal and oil be at peace with the world and build a wall to stop oil
591 2018-02-27 22:35:15 he hates cucks, except when he is one for a sweaty guy selling bootleg snake oil
592 2018-02-27 22:35:15 At the moment I got no idea. There's someone pointing at API numbers not credible so better wait for EIA. Since I'm not so competent in Crude Oil trading I'm waiting.
593 2018-02-27 22:35:12 *creeeeeeeeeeak* I need me some oil
594 2018-02-27 22:35:09 Find out what it is I keep hearing about this bio oil shit 
595 2018-02-27 22:35:03 Allowing Canadian oil & natural gas into the Chinese & Indian energy markets will reduce their CO2 emissions by ~2500Gt.
596 2018-02-27 22:34:54 Time that was halted. Replant the rain forest & go back to rape seed oil!
597 2018-02-27 22:34:50 Hey.  So don't get your oil changed at the York Walmart.  Not only did they lie about things in the car, they put in the wrong oil and replaced things I didn't consent to.
598 2018-02-27 22:34:36 How about oil?
599 2018-02-27 22:34:31 Damn guy at the oil change place just convinced me to do this and replace that, he’s lucky I just that tax refund. 
600 2018-02-27 22:34:30 Would be a good idea if DEMs stopped running pro-frackers & big oil  takers for office too.
601 2018-02-27 22:34:23 @lushcosmetics “damaged” hot oil treatment and their “R&B leave in conditioner” are my new favorites. My hair is soooo soft + my curls are super moisturized & defined 
602 2018-02-27 22:34:22 直接受け取る方向で考えますね。
603 2018-02-27 22:34:19 ...just for the record, I support @mayorethananc. Under the circumstances, he's done a good job as #Anchorage Mayor.  I don't know Rebecca Logan...don't know where she came from but just the fact that she's GM of an oil,gas mining industry Assoc turns me off.
604 2018-02-27 22:34:14 I make fries usually, as a side. Peel. Slice into 1/4" wedges. Drizzle w salt, pepper, oil. Bake 1hr @ 400. Flip halfway, then as needed to desired crisp. Dip in ranch!
605 2018-02-27 22:34:13 Gender pay gap is a myth, men make more because they have harder and more dangerous jobs..don't see many women out in the oil patch or working construction, they are all working low paying secretary and other easy jobs
606 2018-02-27 22:33:56 It is good, if oil price is not enough, Gas also can take the right place as Asia is the most promising market for both of oil and gas
607 2018-02-27 22:33:54 people who smoke cigarettes in the Megabus bathroom deserve to drink castor oil
608 2018-02-27 22:33:52 i wanted to kill myself 3weeksago because i had been unemployed for 6+ months then I got this badass job i fell in love with and they terminated my employment because of a poss of hash oil charge i got when I was 17 hahahahaha full circle!
609 2018-02-27 22:33:44 Go BEN go! Get our oil to shoreline!

612 2018-02-27 22:33:27 Bibi cares not for your norms, laws, & clearances. And Israel & oil producers are all TrumpCo care about. S'all good.
613 2018-02-27 22:33:22 @nailogical says to just use a regular polish and a nice top coat and then use the jojoba oil near your cuticles to revive them 
614 2018-02-27 22:33:05 Why coconut oil over something neutral like say... canola oil? Is it just better for you?
615 2018-02-27 22:32:59 Micellar water -> makeup remover/cold cream -> coconut oil + baby wipes (wash your face w cleanser after!)
616 2018-02-27 22:32:54 He shines like a defrosted chicken breast. I offer my delicate sausage fingers as tribute for the next body oil application.
617 2018-02-27 22:32:48 ..even accounting for corruption in neighbouring countries, e.g oil and gas pipelines.
618 2018-02-27 22:32:39 I’m very aware of palm oil in products.. I do not need Richard Branson to tell me what is ethical he should be looking at himself...non dom hypocrite suing the NHS !!!

625 2018-02-27 22:30:48 @JeffreeStar heyyyy!! I have a question: how do you touch up your makeup through the day? Just blotting excess oil or using powder? Or both?? Or something else all together!
626 2018-02-27 22:30:48 The war in Iraq can but argued that it was and is an oil war and I won’t debate that, I too criticize our government for implementing that war. But Afghanistan is not an oil war.
627 2018-02-27 22:30:35 Oh the oil man is angry! Never good
628 2018-02-27 22:30:22 Hope the dopey NO voters feel pleased with their stupid selves. Fooled by the *oil running out* unionist scam in2014.

639 2018-02-27 22:29:04 @preacherr_mann preacher I don’t need you trying to throw oil on me nahhhh 
640 2018-02-27 22:29:00 If we wouldn’t try taking oil that isn’t ours we wouldn’t need to worry about people going to war with us in certain countries. Our freedom was already fought for. Our freedom is not fought for today. Clones of American society believe that.
641 2018-02-27 22:28:55 Have you @shermansnotes been to a former mining or oil drilling location? There is nothing "take care" about those places.
642 2018-02-27 22:28:42 Why do you have oil painting grey-green coloured jeans?!
643 2018-02-27 22:28:31 You can do the talking but we remain who we are,ABUSITES and Naturally ahead,and if e don reach to throw blows,we'll send our students from your family n home to do it fr us,we r just interwoven in you, Ba yadda aka iya damu
644 2018-02-27 22:28:24 No, it’s not. Oil was the main issue in the gulf war, honey. The Afghanistan war is completely different.

647 2018-02-27 22:28:03 this 26 yo really tryna get to know the kid. then he work in the oil field 
648 2018-02-27 22:28:00 Coming to the dealership for that free oil change reminds you to never go to the dealership for that free oil change.
649 2018-02-27 22:27:59 Jared Kushner looks like he lactates oil.
650 2018-02-27 22:27:53 what do u use the oil on? im over taking these pills just to get out of bed.
651 2018-02-27 22:27:40 Apparently Putin had no clue that the mercenaries attacked the oil field...which is a statement that is hard to believe ;)
652 2018-02-27 22:27:40 We already have what we call “freedom” from wars YEARS AGO but the major war currently going on now is literally because we want to steal other countries’ oil.

660 2018-02-27 22:25:57 You're such a lame joke. You don't sell 'snake oil"? Boy, that's all you're doing. How much is CNN paying you to sell their brand of snake oil?
661 2018-02-27 22:25:55 That makes sense. I've always been curious to know why we still import oil.
662 2018-02-27 22:25:47 Haha . You need the oil more dimwit.  Your head need cum,  fuck u bitch
663 2018-02-27 22:25:39 I love that wild growth oil , that shit really magical or something bc my shit been growing hella fast .
664 2018-02-27 22:25:37 Nigeria: The price of gasoline is 0.48 U.S. Dollar per liter. Nigeria is a oil producer and Zimbabwe is not. So please let's not compare oranges and lemons here. Get the facts and reasons behind facts instead of just blasting out nonsense here.

683 2018-02-27 22:23:43 got my oil changed, saw my mom for a couple of hours, ran around for a couple of more hours, she is being discharged to the rehab center today or tomorrow, thankful for that.
684 2018-02-27 22:23:42 So you are for pipelines? If so I agree that's it's much safer than transporting oil,by rail.
685 2018-02-27 22:23:41 While we understand that petrol prices can appear high at times, the price of fuel is determined by a number of factors including global oil prices and movements in the Australian dollar. 2/3

691 2018-02-27 22:22:49 My fried rice skills are improving  I’m so happy~~ my mom would be so proud (or criticize the amount of oil I used)
692 2018-02-27 22:22:49 Yes, just saw that. We wathced them being build in 2009 when we arrived here. First thing to appear was a support rig; at a distance it looked like an oil platform, which is what I assumed it was. I was wrong, sadly.

694 2018-02-27 22:22:11 Would assume that the overseas and US interests whose only goal is to keep our oil landlocked don't care about coal. This is why you never hear of all of the oil tankers feeding the eastern provinces, it's because they are importing, not exporting.

702 2018-02-27 22:21:05 What does Saudi Arabia do to reduce the price on oil barrels? They flood the market. They do the reverse in order to elevate the value. How do gun manufacturers increase their sales? Wait for hysterical rhetoric to take them away. It’s not really rocket science.

714 2018-02-27 22:18:22 You are incredible. You pretend you care about these groups & what they support after gutting all social programs and backing your prez’s push to force food instead of food stamps. Maybe you could take of your oil and gas profits from selling out in ANWR to help them. Hypocrite!
715 2018-02-27 22:18:10 What is rude? The fact that Pierre Trudeau’s nationalizing oil shutting down Alberta where people lost homes? Pierre giving a town in BC the finger from a train?
He was snowboarding in a off limits zone and got what happens when ignore rules. Truth does hurt.
716 2018-02-27 22:18:02 This kid is saving whales, climate, manipulating consumer habits and every other SJW cause imaginable. He's drunk with power. Pull plug.
717 2018-02-27 22:17:58 Calgary mayor Nenshi was just in South Korea and they openly expressed that they have the refineries and want our oil. Global demand is going up and for the most part is driven by Asain countries. More lies from the Green Party
718 2018-02-27 22:17:54 I just looked at my bank account and thought I had $50 from my mom’s bi-weekly deposit she gives me but hen I remembered that I used that money to pay for an oil change and now here I am, crying at my wallet pls I am a hungry child
719 2018-02-27 22:17:50 Because such promises by governments are all solemnly kept and binding. Kyoto, Paris, right? Not the ostentatious, green-servile virtue-signalling they obviously are? They’re lofty promises because they’re airheaded. Oil is here to stay.
720 2018-02-27 22:17:47 A soft ball for @Singlemaltfiend
721 2018-02-27 22:17:28 And now Russia, China, and Iran are selling oil in other currencies without any consequences except for the indictment of 13 Russian trolls for tweeting mean things about Hillary. It ain't 2003 no more.
722 2018-02-27 22:17:14 ❧  Scaldyng Gruyau  ❧

Offer to an annoying person. Use it up quicke.

● pinch of onyx
● 6 chopped cloves
● some oil of vitriol
● a few webs
● 8 holly sprigges

The smell is obscene.

Single use.
723 2018-02-27 22:17:05 Sometimes things aren’t pulling through because YOU are not coming through. Fast, pray, bathe yourself in oil.... but YOU DIDNT COME THROUGH! #obedience #yousaidyouweregonnadoit #butyoudidnt
724 2018-02-27 22:16:55 434 miles until my next oil change.  Good day to all y’all.
725 2018-02-27 22:16:50 Dark chocolate espresso pancakes with coconut flour, cooked in coconut oil.
726 2018-02-27 22:16:46 they charged me $2 for chili oil wtf
727 2018-02-27 22:16:43 He's a snake oil salesman. Peddling misinformation and "miracle cures"
728 2018-02-27 22:16:41 throwback to my 16 year old self in my high school parking lot with handfuls of paper towels i got from the girl's bathroom trying to watch youtube tutorials on how to check your oil. why didn't our fathers teach us things
729 2018-02-27 22:16:37 this hemp oil is literally my last hope.. 
730 2018-02-27 22:16:30 but you still want to flog oil and gas at a multiple of years gone by and still pretend we will meet Paris -  better lay that plan out for all to see - Global Warming not just Canada warming
731 2018-02-27 22:16:27 im gonna have to visit my boyfriend omer deserres bc i have like 2 canvases and not enough paint and no linseed oil or oil brushes... im in the $ danger zone
732 2018-02-27 22:16:07 Can hardly wait for politicians like Brenden to start working for the people instead of big lobbying groups like the oil industry, Wall Street bankers and the NRA! Good luck!
733 2018-02-27 22:15:43 When I went to get my oil changed. Honda told me it was time for my 1 year check up that’s gonna cost $400. If they aren’t a lie

736 2018-02-27 22:15:28 Or could possibly the euro become strong enof & hold NATO together. Remember Saddam got in trouble trying to sell oil for euros
737 2018-02-27 22:15:25 I did some air frying in my @june oven and I’m impressed with this new feature. However, I’m not impressed with the taste. Once you’ve had vegetable oil fried foods, it’s hard to leave that behind, but I’ll try.
738 2018-02-27 22:15:25 Check your Engine oil this afternoon.
739 2018-02-27 22:15:22 Pffff.  Forget about technological progress.  Amerika is all about the important stuff: oil drilling, fossil fuel, climate change denial, guns 4 everyone, Jesus, and America first.
740 2018-02-27 22:15:09 then stop investing in oil...stop letting pipelines be built...invest in renewable energy....protect our threatened species....do more
741 2018-02-27 22:15:09 Epp ya boy, so I can be popping also which accoint u deh talk that time. My AccessBank no go work
742 2018-02-27 22:15:01 Please come to my house.  I have brooms, mops, vacuums, Bona, Murphy's Oil Soap, Barkeeper's Friend, Mr. Clean Magic Erasers, and absolutely no urge to use any of the above.
743 2018-02-27 22:14:50 Wow...I wonder if Federal Donuts are just greasier than others, or maybe I never keep a donut around long enough to see how much oil seeps out? 
744 2018-02-27 22:14:40 Never seen him defend positions in debate. Presented as defacto moral authority above question. Unfocused, incoherent  rambling nonesense.
745 2018-02-27 22:14:38 The express always is a expert at hype. Remember the headline. Toxic death. Only find out it was smoke from a oil depot.
746 2018-02-27 22:14:34 Drop out and become a professional fly fisher / oil rig DJ
747 2018-02-27 22:14:18 @Jenna_Marbles you should also try a drop or two of peppermint essential oil for upset stomach and nausea!!! It works wonders 
748 2018-02-27 22:14:08 Thank you @RepJerryNadler and all the other excellent members who have served their constituents instead of Big Oil or business! 
749 2018-02-27 22:13:57 Try #oilpulling with tincture. oil based, not alcohol. #cannabis #THC #CBD #wellness
750 2018-02-27 22:13:55 Just got bio oil in my eye, do not recommend
751 2018-02-27 22:13:51 Hey Duff, you can huff and puff, but you lack the stuff.  Libel is publishing a falsehood about another.  Hog WROTE that Jones sells snake oil to the masses.  That is untrue, AKA a falsehood.  Educate yourself.

753 2018-02-27 22:13:42 Climate hawk local elected official @Murillo4Aurora tells how she beat oil and gas' big money with organized people power. #avsummit18
754 2018-02-27 22:13:30 Also the viscosity of the oil/grease in gears and chains change. I remember that as a problem when biking in -30C on rare occasions in Northern Finland.
755 2018-02-27 22:13:26 Oil sheikh chic.
756 2018-02-27 22:13:24 Season well w sesame oil. Then toss in meats and veggies and noodles. Quick and simple!
757 2018-02-27 22:13:05 "Show don't tell" is often useful to keep in mind, but it is also the reason Melville tortured the English-speaking world with thousands and thousands of words about the process of making whale oil. Let this be a lesson.
758 2018-02-27 22:13:01 So I can finish my 60k salary 
759 2018-02-27 22:12:53 Trade deficit relatively ignored this morning but it was horrific. Subtract US oil exports and it would have been even worse. This is deflationary. Plus, combined with the rising budget deficit, it is negative for the dollar MT, engineered dead-cat-bounces aside.
760 2018-02-27 22:12:39 If you be playing in my primrose #fields...best you be watching all your golden yields...I do not seek your soil but just look to your oil.
761 2018-02-27 22:12:38 @BuyMyWeedOnline Have tried a couple of tinctures and oils for chronic pain. So far not so good, nausea mostly. Straight CBD oil no effect at all, so just ordered a 1:1 THC CBD tincture, and hoping for the best. Will let you know :)
762 2018-02-27 22:12:29 Use that squirrel syndrome oil blend I gave you on your solar plexus. It has frankincense in it and is super immune boosting.
763 2018-02-27 22:12:23 Agreed!
764 2018-02-27 22:12:23 You obviously know nothing about shopping.These prices are way out.I can buy 500g of butter for under 2 quid.I can also get a tin of Tuna for around 70p.More tory lies.
PS.Scottish oil is not running out.
765 2018-02-27 22:12:22 Finally, Norway always had the view that near future oil and gas production would be lower. Alberta has almost always forecast more in future than present. Hard to tell my students to save now for when they have a high salary in the future.
766 2018-02-27 22:12:13 who said it “omg i think this coconut oil just fell from the sky!!”
767 2018-02-27 22:12:13 getting burned by an oil splash while frying something.
768 2018-02-27 22:11:58 Dr.Phil is having a frank and graphic discussion with a woman and her history of molestation at the hands of her father, and I'm in jiffy lube just wanting my oil changed and it's fucking disturbing.
769 2018-02-27 22:11:55 Valid point. You can end fast with fish oil. That helps you feel full for longer

777 2018-02-27 22:10:58 1. Tea tree oil
2. Cinnamon
3. Vitamin E oil
778 2018-02-27 22:10:46 don't  forget to drizzle it with some good olive oil at he end! Hope you like it. xo
779 2018-02-27 22:10:43 Well if that’s the case call me Oil
780 2018-02-27 22:10:35 Always tricky when "elected" chiefs' interests collide with hereditary chiefs (who often have popular support in environmental issues). Oil concerns often "contribute" funds to elected chiefs and councils to get "support", and this Chiefs Council is a company construct. #bcpoli

783 2018-02-27 22:10:18 Yeah had a few oil heaters 
784 2018-02-27 22:10:16 Coconut oil is not my friend... It’s greasy and does absolutely nothing for my skin or hair.

787 2018-02-27 22:10:00 Leaving to Disneyland on Friday. Need to get an oil change, hit the mall, get nails and toes done, and pack by Thursday

789 2018-02-27 22:09:40 I need to take my car to the mechanic to get something fixed and I need to get my oil changed before Friday 
790 2018-02-27 22:09:40 Please do... then we can stop letting you steal OUR oil. Yes that's the same oil successive Westminster governments have used to finance their own tawdry plans. Why don't you let us go ?
What could it be  ?
791 2018-02-27 22:09:37 The country with the largest oil reserves and a 31.5% poverty rate was nice before the hundreds of people were killed in food riots with the economy collapsing under the Corrupt Perez Government.
To bad it didn't work out for you.
792 2018-02-27 22:09:25 Guys at warped tour we need to get a monster energy drink and pass it around among us again as we all collectively gag at how disgusting it tastes like.......shocking electric motor oil with a hint of fruit
793 2018-02-27 22:09:01 Perfect
794 2018-02-27 22:08:56 I was complaining ab having to sit and wait for them to get done with my oil change, but some girls beside me are watching fixer upper so I’m fine now
795 2018-02-27 22:08:51 That's what you're going with? What other brand of snake oil do you sell?
796 2018-02-27 22:08:41 Parkland's David Hogg agrees to debate 'sh*t journalist' Alex Jones over unhinged conspiracy theory https. I am tired of victims being victimize again when sleezy People hide behind the 1 amendment to sell their snake oil!, Jones is one of them!
797 2018-02-27 22:08:25 Vichy is essentially a snake oil, any of their products. They use very low quality ingredients and lots of fillers. It's a French brand that even the French won't touch.
798 2018-02-27 22:08:14 I find it ironic that there's a huge oil field in the middle where there's nothing. Like "stay away from me you renewable kids!"
799 2018-02-27 22:07:59 You can troll ABU due to your ignorance of its influence, but your Lecturers will pounce on you like how a lion pounces on its prey for dragging ABU cos they expect you to look up to ABU

804 2018-02-27 22:07:37 I honestly thought it wasn't possible for you to sink lower than peddling your snake oil to the desperate and gullible. But THIS is sickening, even by your lack of standards

808 2018-02-27 22:06:58 It's never been in dispute that "every barrel of oil in the ground would be produced". Basic economics of oil extraction says it would get far too expensive before that happened. But oil corps will... [1]

819 2018-02-27 22:05:00 daily face wash + tea tree oil. I’ll forever stand by this for the rest of my life
820 2018-02-27 22:04:58 Coconut oil is from the Gods...it benefits every single system in the human body, from a molecular level down to the skin, hair, and nails.
821 2018-02-27 22:04:46 I needed to replace the back rotors and shave down the front though and the oil change wasn’t too much more than doing it myself, we can still get a chipotle burrito though 
822 2018-02-27 22:04:45 What I've realized about natural hair is that it becomes very dry and using oil only doesn't really moisturize it, it just makes it shine . So I mix coconut oil with water and spray on my scalp at night, when I remove my braids my fro is super soft and moisturized
823 2018-02-27 22:04:41 Our investments in electric and fuel cell vehicles are reducing harmful pollution that contributes to #climatechange, providing economic opportunities here at home and reducing our dependence on foreign oil -- a win-win-win!

845 2018-02-27 22:02:35 I think it's TOO natural--like fresh ingredients decay faster than chemicals/processed food products? You won't see an Entenmann's peeing oil onto a desk by the end of the day.

857 2018-02-27 22:00:34 1. olives. unless you hate olive oil or all Italians? 2. limes/lemons compliment 1000's of dishes and drinks. but maybe you hate drinking too? 3. tomatoes. perhaps you hate pizza.  4. how about clementines? 5. mangos. nothing needs to be said about mangos.

862 2018-02-27 22:00:22 How much difference does an oil rig make? Where does the price difference become marketing factors instead of a functional improvement?
863 2018-02-27 22:00:12  Where can I buy this olive oil ?

878 2018-02-27 21:58:22 NEWS: Just met w/ @SecretaryZinke re: proposed offshore drilling.

883 2018-02-27 21:57:43 ||I get you. I get annoyed because, supposedly, I get ready for the Events, but I can’t do more than 2 Maps and that it. I ran out of resources. Oil and Bauxite, specially...Not getting Taihō has been a killer as well.
884 2018-02-27 21:57:40 I’ve never really taken the time to research or learn about essential oils .. or tbh really even believed in them ... but honestly the only reason my allergic reaction to my tattoo isn’t flaring up today is because I smothered it in peppermint and copaiba oil.

886 2018-02-27 21:57:34 Can’t even remember the last time i made stew with ground nut oil or with more than 100 naira tomatoes , Na pepper full everywhere
887 2018-02-27 21:57:21 Global implementation would require all the above processing to be performed on quantities three times the total production of coal, gas and oil - for zero return, since CO2 has no value. To my mind adequate injection sites for all this inconceivable.
888 2018-02-27 21:57:19 getting my oil changed and i realize i left my wallet at home so now i have to take a lyft home to get my wallet and lyft back to get my car

891 2018-02-27 21:57:04 i put castor oil on my eyelashes to make them longer and it works which is cool, but also makes wearing my glasses surprisingly hard

893 2018-02-27 21:57:00 Best laugh I’ve had in ages. My 70 year old cousin telling me the story of the last 3 days and nights after 2 drops of cannabis oil.
894 2018-02-27 21:56:55 Great. Only purchased house last week which is oil heated (never had this before) and have delivery coming on thursday but not sure if I'll have enough until then. Also have no drums so struggled to pick up any oil today. Will call over tomorrow afternoon :) Thanks!
895 2018-02-27 21:56:38 Ah...OIL!  Well of course they wanted THAT land. Sagebrush property would never cut it. No doubt the courts have been used for many "personal" endeavor's. Check's and Balance's only go so far, unfortunately.

920 2018-02-27 21:54:11 Not sure how critical he is to Oil success next year, if this is his current benchmark. As for getting lighter and faster, not sure that will help. He needs more work on his skills, like taking/making a pass. How is continued playing making that better?

924 2018-02-27 21:53:41 Lol. You're definitely not from TX. Most Texans have no prob figuring out what the RR commission manages - natural resources, aka oil and gas. It does make sense if you know the industry. Htown is an oil and gas town. The only ppl who complain abt the RR Commission are outsiders.
925 2018-02-27 21:53:35 Oil import sanctions would appear redundant because Venezuela's oil exports to the USA are vanishing anyway. @PattyLaya @fmonaldi

932 2018-02-27 21:52:16 We did a D.I.Y mask. It’s 1/4 cup of coffee grounds, 2 tbsp of honey, & 2 tbsp of coconut oil. I don’t use it religiously since I just made it. I use it like 2 times a week maybe and I love it.
933 2018-02-27 21:52:00 How dumb are Ak legislators to want to barrow money to pay oil credits we have the money in the long run it will cost us less just to pay the bill @AkGovBillWalker @SpeakerChenault @aklegislature
934 2018-02-27 21:52:00 Yeah the first time in my for service department, they tried to sell or should I say force me to use the Synthetic oil for my legacy 3.6 R, those of you who are not value with his vehicle you don’t have to use synthetic oil for the engine.

948 2018-02-27 21:49:15 And again, where did any of those men say we were there to steal their oil.

Wanting to get Iraq's oil fields operational again is a far cry from want to steal their oil, which is what your ilk claimed.

So again, where's all this oil Bush supposedly stole?
949 2018-02-27 21:49:08 When your father asks "Do you have oil" am starting to think there might be something to #TheBeastFromTheEast  not that he would pay for it for me

952 2018-02-27 21:49:00 Venezuela has been under attack by imperialist powers for a very long time, and the recent issues with food, medicine, etc have more to do with economic sanctions and declining price of oil then socialism as a system
953 2018-02-27 21:48:55 Not truffle oil?
954 2018-02-27 21:48:47 It was on 28X just leaving from CMU. Looked kind of like burning oil, but a lot of it.

956 2018-02-27 21:48:37 You know what...I’m not surprised lmao. I’m picturing all that oil money in Dallas and the entitlement dropping from those white folks. Listen, white women in luxury cars are the WORST on the road. Oooooweee 
957 2018-02-27 21:48:36 You would think so. This sort of move will be an economical disaster. Will cost companies billions and put a massive dent in the oil industry. I'm very much against it
958 2018-02-27 21:48:33 Also, I put tea tree oil my ear and that’s all I can smell now 
959 2018-02-27 21:48:29 I bet you tried the coconut oil experiment and it worked.

965 2018-02-27 21:48:02 This world-wide outburst of white supremacists, comes after decades of right-wing governments, including America, using racially-coded rhetoric; the war on terror was just a war against Arabs for oil.

980 2018-02-27 21:45:42 I did try this! I liked it, but it was a bit too salty for me. Have you tried their olive oil popcorn? That and their kettle popcorn are bombbbbb
981 2018-02-27 21:45:39 I can only relate to my expertise in Texas when the IRS was used to confiscate land and Property from the cattleman to drive them out of the United States to Canada. They wanted the oil under their land ! The judges were able to purchase it up for 10¢ in the dollar, like always !
982 2018-02-27 21:45:28 People rave about CBD oil for pain over THC oil, I’ve used low mg stuff but I bet the high mg stuff should help.  Also look into all the essential oils people are recommending.  Also look up holistic joint pain relief for some possibly helpful foods and what not.
983 2018-02-27 21:45:27 I wouldn't really say "Crimea became a part of Russia"... It is Ukrainian, and occupied. 
Anyhow, I think this news about greater US oil production is a bit "embarrassing" for Putin now before the presidential election. Energy politics and prices are still important for his image

992 2018-02-27 21:43:44 @BroadcasterMick Phoenix is like Las Vegas with rain. The roads get slick due to the oil on the roads coming up. Not enough rain to wash it off on a regular basis.
993 2018-02-27 21:43:43 Pointless Oil Wars. The fact they are oil wars means they are anything but pointless. Oil is literally black gold. The reason for the ‘WMD’ cover up is because wet pansies like the MPs you support would suffer meltdowns at the thought.
994 2018-02-27 21:43:25 Not sure yet. Been busy all day getting my cars oil changed and I still have to do some things around the house. What is your twitch name?

Given the climate is already changing and impacts are hitting worse and worse, its been clear to this scientist that the election was all about oil

1011 2018-02-27 21:41:25 Right. He was just the right snake oil salesman. 

Or alternatively infowars is what propelled him to the lead in the republican primaries and the history follows from there.
1012 2018-02-27 21:41:22 Electric utilities need to go after the oil companies business, transportation. The transition to electric vehicles is a tremendous growth opportunity for utilities and will cause electricity demand to go up.

1016 2018-02-27 21:40:48 Keep in mind that one gov't perspective could be a preference for tax revenue from drugs, and not from oil & gas...I can see that from NDPers from everywhere except AB. They need to get their tax fix from somewhere.

1039 2018-02-27 21:38:15 Putin had high popularity when prices were down and Crimea became a part of Russia, I think oil money played a big part to help putin establish his “regime” to last past the bad times that Russia is currently facing
1040 2018-02-27 21:38:03 And then they wonder why women are annoyed by the tweet. It’s weird. Like we can both drive to get a $30 oil change . That’s not even comparable.

1123 2018-02-27 21:27:10 You mean selling snake oil and vitamins isn't funding the 4th Reich?
1124 2018-02-27 21:27:09 Bruh!! Heard they pay better than most oil companies too... But trash still dey everywhere sha...highkey
1125 2018-02-27 21:26:54 Sigh, I actually witnessed someone using the darkness of an oil as a selling point. She states darker oils are better for you than lighter oils. That’s how you can tell a good oil from a bad oil. She was selling a hair growth oil.

1127 2018-02-27 21:26:14 Okay, so once again I’m using butter as oil, and still stealing my roommates tea bags, and the occasional drop of milk.

1131 2018-02-27 21:25:27 Well yeah, it's probably not going to magically work overnight. Instead we should invest in snake oil acting classes so we can be THICC crisis actors overnight!

1147 2018-02-27 21:23:49 It has happened, my people, god has given us a great gift. This huge amount of oil we've found off the coast of mother Russia can only be the work of god.

Why the hell would anyone do this? America produces too much corn due to government subsidies, so we turn corn into HFCS, vegetable oil, artificial coffee creamer, etc.

Leave it to the market and some of them would just plant something else.

1188 2018-02-27 21:18:26 Second, we've been dumping billions of dollars into offense and letting our defenses rot because corporate elites have more interest in foreign oil than they do our actual National Security. (Which should lead us to asking if the real reason they don't want to secure elections is

It seems that way cos most of the money made comes from oil, which govt controls the sale of.

1233 2018-02-27 21:11:42 It`s hard to find someone to do a good job of chroming engines, forks, exhausts etc because they don`t want to contaminate the bath with oil. Plenty of shit places doing though.

1242 2018-02-27 21:10:43 No, government spending should push the economy, during a crisis. The crisis does not come from government budget problems, it’s a collapse of the GDP and oil export. The rest is just the everyday opposition obsession

1246 2018-02-27 21:10:28 The bigger problem is that we don’t produce much. The mainstay of our economy is from crude oil sale.

That’s not really production. Just tier 1 extractive industry.

This basic lack of value creation is our problem.

1263 2018-02-27 21:09:01 I hope he talks about how he told hurricane sandy victims 5 and half years out of their homes to live on an oil spill. So happy he has the money for his trip but no $$ for hurricance victims in NYC.
1264 2018-02-27 21:08:58 M, I go in-between Calgary and Victoria.  Hang out with oil patch guys and farmers.  Our values and views are mostly intact with a seasoning of modern thought. however that the greens think they are void of reality.

1267 2018-02-27 21:08:22 And @realDonaldTrump believes what he says as gospel. He is a literal snake oil salesman
1268 2018-02-27 21:08:18 even if price on oil get down?
1269 2018-02-27 21:08:07 What sacrifices? Getting free oil for the government? 
1270 2018-02-27 21:08:00 - Isco's quality dropped so much, you'd think his contribution was determined by the price of oil.
1271 2018-02-27 21:07:53 my boss just rescheduled my meeting with him and i cant be more grateful...at lunch i kept dropping the veggies on my shirt and now it has oil spots all over the front.

1283 2018-02-27 21:06:27 for the castor and coconut oil, do you just buy a disposable applicator and dip it??
1284 2018-02-27 21:06:10 I asked for a blast of oil, not castor oil!
1285 2018-02-27 21:06:05 Even now with my own car the only thing I do is get an oil change. My dad does everything else. It’s sad really. He actually just finished work on my car like 2 days ago cause yet AGAIN I ruined it 
1286 2018-02-27 21:05:58 I would say that they are tools of Big Money, Big Oil, in reality an oligarchic mini-minority of Americans who want a hypersensitized anti-government base to vote against any and all regulations, like...carbon emissions, for example.

1299 2018-02-27 21:04:09 It could be that the Republicans blocked pretty much anything he tried to do. I mean EVERYTHING. That's one. But yeah, when he had the majority, he could have done more, and didn't. Talked about no tax breaks for big oil during run, but silence after winning.

1311 2018-02-27 21:02:46 But almost immediately, people started arguing with me about things I hadn’t said:

Whether antitrust is good or bad.

Whether it was justified to use it against Standard Oil.

Whether Standard Oil was good or bad.

And so on, and so on.

1321 2018-02-27 21:02:02 In my defense my dad handled everything with the cars. Negotiated prices, oil changes, services etc. whenever I’d take even the slightest interest in learning about them he would say “no go back in the kitchen and cook with your mom, that’s your job”
1322 2018-02-27 21:01:45 No. he is not worthy of such an honor this Snake Oil salesman made million from talking elderly retirees out of their small pay checks. Preached hate of others that were different from him. Never mind the separation of Church and State. Evangelicals are a hate filled cult.

1324 2018-02-27 21:01:40 Buy a round roast, cook and cut it into strips. Drizzle a little olive  oil (so they don’t stick together)on the strips. Freeze in a baggie. You will have good healthy treats for dog for a long time.  Most packaged treats are from China
1325 2018-02-27 21:01:38 All of us (countries and people) could end our dependency on foreign oil overnight if we decided to work with nature.
Use plants to replace all plastics, use for building material and as a food source.
No more shipping oil long distance.
Just have local oil engineering facilities
1326 2018-02-27 21:01:36 wow... so you're hoping the foreign pipeline corp will pony up sufficient cash for the Squamish ppl so they can switch their livelihoods  from fishing and  10,000 years of cultural  linked to the land and sea - to oil spill recovery? 

you hope for this?

1339 2018-02-27 21:00:58 Do they NOT know how to REAaD? Grrrrr! How many times does this FACT need to be drilled ( if oil they'd get it) home?
1340 2018-02-27 21:00:44 I made only two points:

1) Anti-trust law is intended to keep players operating within a competitive market.

2) Monopolies can and do form absent government regulation or collusion.

The example I gave of #2 was Standard Oil. That’s all.

1348 2018-02-27 21:00:02 Years of resistance to natural gas caused an avoidable crisis during the polar vortex of 2014-15. New England was forced to rely on coal and oil for more than 20% of its energy — the equivalent of adding 650,000 cars to the road.

1353 2018-02-27 20:59:16 Lol I tried straight up coconut oil. It wasn’t awful, I think I just used too much of it.
1354 2018-02-27 20:59:06 I came for an oil change & this dude really put me down for tire rotation at “customers” request. Just cus I’m a women you think I’d pay for whatever and not consult my spouse stupid fuck. Then when I told him to not do the tire rotation he made a stupid face.

1368 2018-02-27 20:57:17 basically what you do is take a g of wax and put it in the oven at 200 for 20 min. put it in the freezer so it hardens. put that on a fork and very gently light it with a lighter so it drips into ur butter( i’d use coconut oil if u can) n that’s it

1392 2018-02-27 20:55:05 I'm going to keep calling you out because if you really cared about kids you would say something about Planned Parenthood and the hundreds of thousands of kids they kill every year but you don't because that wouldn't fit the MSM narrative. You are the true snake oil salesman..smh
1393 2018-02-27 20:54:57 Such as bathing appears to you - oil, sweat, dirt, filthy water, all disgusting - so is every part of life and everything.  Marcus Aurelius
1394 2018-02-27 20:54:53 Cathartic process:  a rough crazy sketch made with finger dragging a red-oil-paint-dipped rag on a Masonite board prepped with titanium white acrylic over sludge.
1395 2018-02-27 20:54:50 HIPSTER ALERT @mcauz56 talking about orange wine. And Matt at one time called me a hipster for liking Tempranillo & Grüner Veltliner. Somebody buy Matt beard oil, commemorative pins and an expos cap.
1396 2018-02-27 20:54:44 Can't wait to see Teddy go. He will live comfortably with all that money he has pocketed from the NRA and the oil industry and all the tax cuts he got from you. Good riddance Ted.
1397 2018-02-27 20:54:39 With oil? You put veggie oil in ur tea?
1398 2018-02-27 20:54:37 Asian bites/ ginger/ garlic/ sesame oil/ soya sauce/ honey.   Marinate and grill of cook in frying pan
1399 2018-02-27 20:54:26 Im getting an oil change rn and im the only person in the office and ive been listening to the worker breath heavy for the past 45 minutes im ready to blow my head out
1400 2018-02-27 20:54:04 "I dunno if this is even karaage" karaage recipe:
- chicken thighs cup up into small chunks to your liking doesn't matter if there is skin or not on 
- in a bowl place a nice amount to cover soy sauce
- bit of sesame seed oil
- bit of mirin 
- splash of salt
1401 2018-02-27 20:54:04 Omg, i gotta go there for the olive oil ice cream.
1402 2018-02-27 20:53:55 Snake oil salesmen in Lululemon pants are all I see on Instagram these days 
1403 2018-02-27 20:53:51 Chia admitted in his interview that he wasn’t... Camalari has been one of our best point producers over the last 10 games… Veteran presence, and a hot hand at this time of year should’ve been able to dump him for a late pick...speaks to overall competence.. just my 2 cents
1404 2018-02-27 20:53:26 A Snake Oil salesman in honor at the Nations Capitol, can we tell we are in the Trump era yet?
1405 2018-02-27 20:52:59 Guyhhhs castor oil is amaaazing. Accentuated the hair curls!
1406 2018-02-27 20:52:54 Jamaican black castor oil every night on the edges
1407 2018-02-27 20:52:36 Anytime my car needs an oil change or inspection I just assume it’s going to have something terribly wrong. My anxiety is through the roof in the waiting room.
1408 2018-02-27 20:52:08 Why not the same federal help that both states of Texas and Florida received? Houston 2.2mil residents South Fl w/6 millions both are getting over $20B in the “aid package”  Texas a booming oil state and FL a tourisms magnet v. PR deflated and depressed economy only $2B.

1410 2018-02-27 20:51:26 #Russia's economy is very dependent on energy export (gas, oil etc). The high energy prices during #Putin's first 8 years as president (00-08) really boosted his popularity. International Energy Agency predicts: Next year, #USA will pass Russia as the world's largest oil producer
1411 2018-02-27 20:51:15 Good luck!!
Have you seen any reports online of other people having the same problem with the same car? My mom had a car that guzzled oil, turned out there was a known issue with that make/model.
1412 2018-02-27 20:51:13 1. Who knows if we went Iraq for their oil (though Trump says “we should have taken their oil”)
2. However, this is very much like if Blackwater owned an oil company and signed a deal with the Iraq govt to get a cut of the profits of any oil fields they liberated from ISIS.
1413 2018-02-27 20:51:09 You've licked your own oil?
1414 2018-02-27 20:51:06 She's not. She was recently fired from her UK media jobs and had to move out of her house.

She's clearly posturing for a job in the States. She'll be there, sat next to Paul Watson and M*lo, hawking snake oil pills.
1415 2018-02-27 20:51:03 Snake oil ! your so original
1416 2018-02-27 20:50:59 I was trying to hide in the back of my car so I could get up on the lift while my car was getting the oil changed and I got caught. V disappointed
1417 2018-02-27 20:50:54 he has amotive. this is his way of buying time get oil, food etc. i don't trust him. let president trump know. this is his history dating back to pres. clinton. i can't figure out the china leader is he afraid of him i know mr. putin doesn;t want us to attack he said it.
1418 2018-02-27 20:50:47 Meant to say neem oil lol. Try health alternatives for the clay as well, or Notwane pharmacy in main mall
1419 2018-02-27 20:50:26 It makes no sense that my oil changes be like $90 
1420 2018-02-27 20:50:20 Please block this person on my behalf. What? Palm oil jollof rice underated? You are a learner
1421 2018-02-27 20:50:11 Just stole your fish oil
Now you need2buy more
1422 2018-02-27 20:49:57 The economic crisis in Venezuela is not a “normal” recession crisis: it is fabricated in the sense that oil prices were manipulated in 2014 and sanctions and media blockade helped the isolation of Venezuela. You can add gov mistakes but that wouldn’t have changed much
1423 2018-02-27 20:49:51 Well, that shifty-eyed snake oil salesman of a sexting minister.
1424 2018-02-27 20:49:48 If you Google "Stacy Dash Congress" the headlines all emphasize "clueless" actress.

1426 2018-02-27 20:49:35 I can barely breathe this water thanks to YOUR oil spill.  Humans are heartless.
1427 2018-02-27 20:49:24 Saudi-led coalition and international community should help #Yemen government to bring development back at least in regions liberated from Houthi militants. Aid is not enough. Reopen oil and gas prjects. Reopen and operate Yemen ports. #UAE_Must_Leave_Yemen.

1428 2018-02-27 20:49:17 Baby!!! moisturize your belly every day, get bio oil and coco butter... Bio Oil cleared the stretch marks that I had on my titties before prom, within a month
1429 2018-02-27 20:49:16 I use an oil cleanser, and I have to agree. Only problem is trying to clean the face cloth after! #fblchat

1431 2018-02-27 20:49:08 I had to check my oil in my car and now I can’t figure out how to close the hood all the way. Nice.
1432 2018-02-27 20:49:07 why are the literal two most 'is it vegan?' question items turkey and olive oil like. i just have no idea what to say to either and yet again and again i hear it
1433 2018-02-27 20:48:26 I’m way funnier in real life g, you should see me off that oil!
1434 2018-02-27 20:48:23 #castroledge How long should I go before I have to change the oil if my car is not driven more than about 500 miles a year?  When does time become a factor?
1435 2018-02-27 20:48:20 Deciem proucts, I love them! And oil rather than cream #deciem @deciemchatroom #fblchat
1436 2018-02-27 20:48:13 oil smuggler is more suiting for US , as they are stealing mid east oil and also US must be top terrorist supporter @UN @BBCWorld @cnni @AP @Europarl_EN @EU_Commission
1437 2018-02-27 20:48:10 Did you know? Not only did @Interior propose to open up the largest amount of U.S. coastline to #oil and gas drilling in history but they also are working to rollback the vital protections put in place after the Deepwater Horizon disaster. This is bad for business and Americans.
1438 2018-02-27 20:48:08 If only there were some other way to get oil to market besides rail... #bcpoli #cdnpoli
1439 2018-02-27 20:48:02 Olive oil can be massaged into the skin. Over time it makes your skin appear very toned.
1440 2018-02-27 20:47:47 Blue states & tax breaks are oil & water
1441 2018-02-27 20:47:25 pele. I have oil, I can make the sauce and send it down
1442 2018-02-27 20:47:14 We missed out on the oil crisis and the 3 day week. My dads job took us abroad to Thailand. Lovely. #BackInTimefortea
1443 2018-02-27 20:47:09 I’m a different person when I’m off the thieves oil 
1444 2018-02-27 20:47:03 Most of the time with me it sounds like slowly opening an old, heavy oak door that hasn't seen a drop of oil in its hinges since it was hung.
1445 2018-02-27 20:47:03 Apparently the snake oil inhibits one’s ability to feel shame. Seriously, he needs to put his shirt back on.
1446 2018-02-27 20:46:59 Baby oil is a blessing
1447 2018-02-27 20:46:58 I use mainly avocado oil tbh  but for your masks you can use castor oil mixed with shea butter oil
1448 2018-02-27 20:46:53 @SecretaryZinke your proposal to open American coastal waters to speculative oil drilling is a death sentence for Massachusetts lobstermen and the New England fishing fleet. #NoDrillingMA
1449 2018-02-27 20:46:47 Chef Ramses cut up some tinsel, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was some  human flesh, along with Silly Putty.

1451 2018-02-27 20:46:32 Oil

1452 2018-02-27 20:46:18 @NitishKumar will take the consigned oil, return to the polls, and the children will be crushed? But the crushing will be save because he is the leader of the BJP, when there no difference in the death of thousands of children in Gorakhpur, then there are now 9 children in Bihar.
1453 2018-02-27 20:46:16 My fingers are itchy for painting.. *lies in bed, exhausted and not feeling well, bunch of commissions awaiting tomorrow* 

Oil colors... Hmmm...
1454 2018-02-27 20:46:11 I was confused why this thread would induce anger from ANYONE but then you said tankies. I thought you were talking about oil vessels which would be weird
1455 2018-02-27 20:46:01 This problem has been around for quite a few years I noticed it 6yrs ago when researching for my own beauty products, Dr said I had scabies! Wasn't it was chemicals, back then it was really hard trying NOT 2 use / buy palm oil. These firms sell it by the bucketld in variety
1456 2018-02-27 20:45:37 Like oil, whisky and salmon?

1459 2018-02-27 20:45:34 Guys now a days don’t know how to check the oil in their car or even worse, how to change a fucking tire!

1462 2018-02-27 20:45:23 It's amazing the money I'm saving on gas/oil changes now that I live in Ann Arbor
1463 2018-02-27 20:45:22 I’ve been working with Parks and Rec in the background all week! Also, I have a bunch of data for you about oil mills in Cumberland County. Don’t give up!
1464 2018-02-27 20:45:19 Student culture is having your oil run our mere days before the beast from the east, I can see the steam from my pee

1468 2018-02-27 20:44:58 The brand “The Ordinary” has a very cheap rosehip oil I’d recommend. Can find it on their website or at Sephora
1469 2018-02-27 20:44:46 Lavender oil is great for pain and tension headache/migraine relief.
1470 2018-02-27 20:44:26 @ChickfilA I have been eating your sauce thinking it was safe and am now noticing that soybean oil is listed as an ingredient! How do you not count that as having soy in your product?!
1471 2018-02-27 20:44:26 is that a type of motor oil??  sounds like a hair product!!
1472 2018-02-27 20:44:23 — ✣ oil ✣ —
1473 2018-02-27 20:44:20 Pizza grease is my primary essential oil. Steak on the grill would be an awesome second!
1474 2018-02-27 20:44:17 We are fairly like-minded, but in regards to chia, I’m not nearly as high on him as you are… Explain to me how he wasn’t even shopping Camalari (at this point in this lost season)??
1475 2018-02-27 20:44:08 I find that on the days I don’t use the lavender and peppermint oils, I have much harder time falling asleep. I spray peppermint oil on my bed and rub a coconut and lavender oil mixture on the bottoms of my feet and on my chest
1476 2018-02-27 20:43:50 punong puno lage yung kamay ko ng oil paint
1477 2018-02-27 20:43:37 @ChickfilA I can’t have dairy or soy because my baby is intolerant to both these things. I have been using your allergen chart to safely eat at your establishment. Your site says chick fi la sauce is safe. But the first ingredient is soybean oil. Please update your allergen list!

1487 2018-02-27 20:42:29 I object to the implication that good, strong coffee tastes like used motor oil.
1488 2018-02-27 20:42:21 Wow, now I’m trying to picture what it smells like, people walking around drenched in olive oil. 

Mmmm...

1493 2018-02-27 20:41:51 They spend >half < there time selling snake oil suppliments. They spend the other half distributing bullshit information. Info-wars is a news network the same way playdough could be a food. Except playdough's non-toxic.
1494 2018-02-27 20:41:45 Ironically, the front of the bottle says "Excellent source of Omega 3 ALA" but the first ingredient listed on the same bottle  is soybean oil.

1527 2018-02-27 20:37:33 We should get rid of guns and bombs. Go back to swords and arrows, fire balls with oil flung from miles away. Maybe people I would be less likely to want war when it turned so personal

1532 2018-02-27 20:36:51 I'm reasonably sure the Bible recommends coconut oil or hot oil treatments. I think it's in Acts.
1533 2018-02-27 20:36:39 I miiiiight just take you up on that! It’s bound to be better than my experience with coconut oil
1534 2018-02-27 20:36:29 Western societies no longer need to capture or use slaves by force because they benefit from slavery in the mid e, Africa, and Asia as I said before. Western powers prefer oppressive and fascist regimes who will give them oil and mineral concessions in exchange for wpn deals lol
1535 2018-02-27 20:36:27 You don’t really want me to go there 
In the 60’ and 70’s they produced some great innovative prog rock and rock bands. Some great B&B’s in seaside towns
Lots of weed, speed and lsd too. 
And a huge superiority complex, using our oil.
1536 2018-02-27 20:36:23 Russia would not be there, only reason they are is bc Assad choose an oil pipeline, that was NOT supported/funded by USA. another illegal war for oil.
1537 2018-02-27 20:36:22 You know when you’re just busy living your life, whipping up wicked shea butter & coconut oil mixes, trying to drink enough water, and just being in tune with your God.

Yeah, that.

1539 2018-02-27 20:36:08 Legally, a monopoly is when a company has ENOUGH of the market to be able to directly influence prices.

That’s all. It doesn’t have to be 100%.

Standard Oil, at one point, had more than 90% of the market.

He claimed that’s "not a monopoly" because it wasn’t 100%.

BS.
1540 2018-02-27 20:35:44 I didn’t bring my oil pen and I’m pissedddd I have to go have emissions testing done on my car tf is this shit
1541 2018-02-27 20:35:41 Snake oil is palatable. Morbid opportunism goes down harshly and leaves me nauseated.

1582 2018-02-27 20:30:17 Senator Cruz does not have a genuine ‘win-win’ solution to put on the table.  Let’s cut to the chase.  These antics from Senator Cruz aren’t about RIN prices, Cruz is trying to limit ethanol’s market share on behalf of Big Oil. #RFSworks
1583 2018-02-27 20:30:10 So that’s £149 for an oil change and a load of guff then. I’ll wash my own car thanks.

1585 2018-02-27 20:29:19 2002 Bush & Blair tore Iraq apart looking for weapons of mass destruction. Why is Kim Jong-un now allowed to wave his Nukes around with zero response other than inane comments on Twitter about button size?

Could it be that North Korea has no oil?

Discuss Twitter.
1586 2018-02-27 20:29:15 I take pride in my rolling, I only like hitting oil if I’m in a rush
1587 2018-02-27 20:29:07 I’m watching a special about a family of evangelical Christians who produce cannabis oil for people who suffer with epilepsy.  There’s nothing unchristian about helping people with a plant.  Powerful.
1588 2018-02-27 20:29:02 Check your #roses for powdery mildew and spray with mineral oil (white oil), if necessary cut off leaves showing #blackspot, then spray the plant with triforine or mancozeb
1589 2018-02-27 20:28:54 Why not form an English parliament and stand on your own two feet. I see you don't mention turning the oil and electricity off in your trade embargo. Let's start with those and pick up her nukes on your way home!

1592 2018-02-27 20:28:44 Common sense approach. Nervous parents - Avoid meat, stick to bread and noodles. Anything deep fried is fine, anything fried in oil is good. When in Asia I realise just how gorgeous vegetarian food can be. Best place in Asia for food: Penang. #FamilyTravelHour

1595 2018-02-27 20:28:24 Does that include oil with it
1596 2018-02-27 20:28:12 I loved power cuts in 80s Northern Ireland around the strikes. Didn’t understand the politics but adored the cosiness of oil lamps and candles and coal fires #BackInTimeForTea
1597 2018-02-27 20:28:08 This table was telling me about an oil that would be beneficial to take 2 teaspoons of a day. He said “drink that shit and it’ll taste like a school eraser!” Ummmmm idk about that mister... an easer?

1600 2018-02-27 20:27:51 I haven’t used any of their new stuff, but all of the older stuff has been buttery soft. It may just need a lot of oil and conditioning :/
1601 2018-02-27 20:27:48 I say this meaning zero disrespect, but you fell for the lies and went to Iraq when I was out in the streets screaming at the top of my lungs on 2/15/03. I was out there on behalf of you and your brothers to not be used as cannon fodder for big oil.
1602 2018-02-27 20:27:38 I forget where now and it will frustrate me for a bit, but I remember reading a report/study in last 9mos about impact off oil boom on young NB men, esp those returning now out east to a job marking req'ing qualifications they don't necessarily have.

1604 2018-02-27 20:27:23 Just used it to pan fry chicken breasts in olive oil. It heated the oil without any burning, and I didn’t even need to turn on the exhaust fan.
1605 2018-02-27 20:27:10 But Obama's legacy will be BP Gulf Oil spill, and he was OK strip mining extremely toxic Uranium from our public grazing land. The same land our beef cattle graze on. Give us a break already! Your all fools...
1606 2018-02-27 20:26:39 were also Democrats. If we found out who represents the oil companies at Capitol and w reg agencies, I'm sure you'll find aides to Democratic Gov.s and leg leadership, etc.

1621 2018-02-27 20:23:52 Actually none of those. I would like to get them from a regular pharmacy that doesn't sell motor oil, tires ect. We owned a pharmacy yrs ago. The customer was called by name and got personal service, Not a recorded message that said your pills are ready.

1653 2018-02-27 20:21:07 I live in Saskatchewan. When oil was at it's peak it was easy, especially for guys, to drop out of school get a very well paying job in the oilfield. It's good at the time but when the boom goes away a lot of guys are left with no grade 12 and a rough looking job market.
1654 2018-02-27 20:21:03 Ive been changing things up to raw and fresh food and when I study raw organic peanut butter, it says maybe: Peanuts, Oil, etc" when I pick up some jar of peanut butter anywhere else theres like 13 ingredients so small you can barely read it. Its SCARY man

1667 2018-02-27 20:19:23 I wanna get an oil pen
1668 2018-02-27 20:19:21 I love the Boxum glosses. They stay put, tint and shine real cute. I’ve also been using a lip oil gloss and it’s realll shiny and really conditioning
1669 2018-02-27 20:19:19 The oil from the sausage I was frying popped in my face and I asked my mom to take over for a second so I could recover from my injuries and she basically told me not to be a weak bitch and keep frying
1670 2018-02-27 20:19:06 Magic!!! @KettlewellFuels have been and delivered much needed heating oil whilst at work. No need for 2 jumpers tonight. Thank you!!
1671 2018-02-27 20:19:06 And one Proffessor somewhere recently stated that Nigeria has no data on oil.
1672 2018-02-27 20:19:04 I put my water bottle and paint thinner for oil paint in the same bag and sometimes i just want to drink my paint thinner and end it all

1678 2018-02-27 20:18:27 Canada has the third largest reserves of oil in the World, compare Canada to Norway.  I think we will all see too few in this confederation have benefited from this resource.
1679 2018-02-27 20:18:18 I wouldn't recommend starting a new oil company in California, but that's not a reason to pass up on owning this one at a good price.
1680 2018-02-27 20:18:17 CBD Oil. I use it for my period cramps which can be severe. Sometimes I use them in connection with tylenol and ibuprofen. CBD Oil works better than tramadol, trust I’ve tried them. It may not last as long and taste horrible but it works for me and doesn’t get me addicted.
1681 2018-02-27 20:18:14 Our PM does not want the KM line expanded and he’s just ragging  the puck and hoping KM cancels. I just can’t believe that Notley wants it either. It’s in her DNA to oppose Oil/gas/pipelines.
1682 2018-02-27 20:17:59 my dad had my car to put some oil in it & filled up my tank

1684 2018-02-27 20:17:56 What after the mandatory health insurance laws have been implemented and all expats and labor forces have been covered?  Analysts expect premium growth in UAE and KSA the two largest insurance Arab markets to slow down with oil prices remaining low
1685 2018-02-27 20:17:41 Yes ma’am. I also add activated charcoal and a few drops of tea tree oil. Do you have dry skin or oily skin?
1686 2018-02-27 20:17:17 I blame it on the oil companies
1687 2018-02-27 20:16:56 i dont even know explicitly; but the second i heard trump and russia; i said he wants to make a trump tower moscow; also tillerson former head of exxon is in position to make oil deals? thats what putin wants? to drill with abandon?
1688 2018-02-27 20:16:55 all we REALLY need is to eliminate gun free zones. all we REALLY need to do is stop telling the bad guys that NO ONE is there who can stop them. leave the numbers and possibilities in the heads of the bad guys
1689 2018-02-27 20:16:53 The ruled will revolt and get friends to help out like Libya and Iraq; unfortunately friends come when u have minerals or oil/; Kenya has both
1690 2018-02-27 20:16:50 Another thing about the politics is that Cal imports like 80 pct of it's oil [which is the reason CRC gets Brent pricing - not WTI] and California enviros are kind of on to the fact that it would be better to burn more of "their" oil produced w some regulations than to import.
1691 2018-02-27 20:16:50 but it doesn't contain palm oil, which is good news for the orangutans!
1692 2018-02-27 20:16:33 Aztec clay mask on the skin and face. Washed with African black soap (not the Shea Moisture bullshit) and Dr. Bronner’s Peppermint soap, and moisturizing with African raw shea butter + almond oil. New skin, who is this?

1695 2018-02-27 20:16:07 meanwhile, who needs to spend money on arming teachers (or janitors)? jsut ALLOW those who already own firearms and wish to carry to do so. no requirements, no extra funding, no anything. but if you have received NRA training and wish to carry do so
1696 2018-02-27 20:15:38 True true. This is really scary and it comes with Trudeau's aim to regulate free speech online. Why does he feel the need to regulate just for the sake of regulation. same with the econ industry (oil, asbestos, gold) wtf...?

1703 2018-02-27 20:14:52 Hi @nestle. The issues are quite serious. Now seems like a good time to stop sourcing palm oil from REPSA. Why wait until September? (1/3)
1704 2018-02-27 20:14:29 Abeg if u get bois join me make ibdey pick fr them
1705 2018-02-27 20:13:46 Useful tips that anyone can take advantage of and implement right away. When I go to the store later today, I know what type of oil to look for. And that I need more dark green leafs in my life.

1710 2018-02-27 20:13:27 I had the exact same issue! If you get it, use it 2-3 times a day and most of the oil should clear up! 
1711 2018-02-27 20:13:27 Sure, pretend there is equality between the parties. The GOP sells snake oil.  Now, we're still waiting for your article to match Dr. Krugman's. Let's see yours.

1716 2018-02-27 20:12:45 You seem confused, Ron. Confused by the WORDS of politicians - esp Trudeau - as opposed to their ACTIONS. Trudeau has thus far done ZERO to get a pipeline built. On the other hand, his ACTIONS consistently show hostility and obstruction toward the oil indy.

1721 2018-02-27 20:12:31 Sorry if you don't know anything of natural medicine you should be bashing it. His supps do work. Hell half of them are sold at Whole Foods yet no one says they sell snake oil. Some of his are just rebranded and sometimes cheaper.
1722 2018-02-27 20:12:26 Bet he looks rough now, he was no oil painting then 
1723 2018-02-27 20:12:24 More time I don't put anything in it. I think I neglect it actually. Odd time I put Cantu argan oil or this olive oil cream thing. Whatever I can get my hands on really, like once a week maybe lool

1726 2018-02-27 20:12:12 The Prize by Daniel Yergin, Hacks Donna Brazile, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions by Thomas Kuhn are really good. The Prize is really long history of the oil business and has a documentary.
1727 2018-02-27 20:12:09 Is it worse than Fenty's oil results?
1728 2018-02-27 20:11:53 I asked my dad to teach me how to change my own oil & he looked at me and laughed  so I need to know if he willing to pay for my oil changes once my warranty expires
1729 2018-02-27 20:11:47 Is this dude really hitting on me while I’m getting my oil change ?
1730 2018-02-27 20:11:35 you should see if an oil company wants the mineral rights to your forehead
1731 2018-02-27 20:11:26 My direct flight from LGA to DFW is now stopping in Indiana 'to refuel'. @Delta what fresh hell of oil arbitrage is this? Please update your GasBuddy.
1732 2018-02-27 20:11:19 ..like oil in the water

1737 2018-02-27 20:10:40 Already following all 3 survivors listed in this Tweet.  The corrupt garbage in big gun, oil and coal want to suppress and silence everyone.

We'll vote you @GOP garbage out.  And we won't be intimidated.
1738 2018-02-27 20:10:35 Another happy ending, would have preferred to see the person in the window pour boiling hot oil out of the window 
1739 2018-02-27 20:10:33 Yes, and they would certainly play into Maduro’s rhetoric during the campaign. I imagine Trump might think it will turn people out for the opposition so that the oil sanctions stop.
1740 2018-02-27 20:10:33 "World Leading Standards" for cleanup of an open ocean #OILSpill is 10-15% of the oil spilled - in perfect conditions with no wind & a flat ocean.  #bcpoli #abpoli #cdnpoli #StopKM @justintrudeau

1748 2018-02-27 20:08:58 . Yes, the oil industry is a mooch on the Govt dole. It's one of the things it has in common ethanol. Now go Fuck yourelf.
1749 2018-02-27 20:08:35 Would you agree that US oil sanctions *after* the Venezuelan sham election would look a tad better, diplomatically speaking?
1750 2018-02-27 20:08:33 Alex Jones is a liar and a fraud, peddling snake oil to easily swayed idiots.
Just because you buy into Alex Jones’ bullshit doesn’t mean David has to entertain the blubbering moron.

1754 2018-02-27 20:07:56 Imagine if you had a transverse V6 or one of those F-bodies with the last spark plugs somewhere under the dashboard.

The Polo was at 80k km when I did the plugs on it and they didn't put up a meaningful fight. Some people use penetrating oil.

1757 2018-02-27 20:07:44 Potentially wicked developer dandruff. Tea tree oil can sort that out. And showering, like.
1758 2018-02-27 20:07:40 Thanks for the update/quasi fact check. Worth thinking about whether it’s worth putting on someone if the net effect is to mislead. Being open to others’ views is important but not the proverbial snake oil salesman.
1759 2018-02-27 20:07:28 nesaudzīgi turpināsim anulēt OIL atļaujas...kaut kā Ziemeļkorejas Kima "mercilessly" ienāca prātā..:D
1760 2018-02-27 20:07:23 I be feeling the same way. Like if i was a car, i wouldnt have no tires, gas would be in the engine, oil in the gas tank, water for transmission fluid, dirty ass windshield, no steering wheel, and 1 door different color then the rest of the car, one head light doin 120 
1761 2018-02-27 20:06:59 Very great perspective. Majority of what most States plan to spend will come from money earned from Oil.

Economic productivity that depends on human activities have very little to with that. Hence, more of why investment in anything that empower individuals to earn is key.
1762 2018-02-27 20:06:59 Is that so they can sit in a warm car once the home heating oil runs out!! 
1763 2018-02-27 20:06:48 You sir, are a buffoon. People out there in non-net-neutrality world, hear me, according to the snake oil salesman, you can no longer get busy with a significant other because net neutrality “allegedly” will slow down your #netflix .. kids, this person is what we call a clown 
1764 2018-02-27 20:06:42 @RyanZinke your proposed 5 yr drilling plan offers NO protection to coastal communities. We need protection & a good mgmt plan for our national forests, not more drilling! Clean up existing oil/gas drilling & invest in new tech like wind, solar, batteries & electronic vehicles.
1765 2018-02-27 20:06:39 Ohhh oil mcburnie
1766 2018-02-27 20:06:27 Totally agree about the stress thing, the question is something many people say to me when I question them about drinking alcohol as stress buster. So I just wanted to know your point of view as you mentioned that in one of your answers

Btw thanks for mentioning olive oil fact

1768 2018-02-27 20:06:03 In light of the #HMCSCalgary fuel spill incident, perhaps marine oil spills should be added to the list of immediate threats requiring emergency measures.

Tho I'm curious how that interacts with a cooking medium like vegetable oil. I'm never sure if the oil in my pan just progressively getting hotter and hotter, and I'm not a fan of setting off my smoke detector.

1777 2018-02-27 20:04:40 It was an opinion. Anyway, I think governments get too much credit when things good and to much flak when things bad. ND's. ND's very little to do with bad economy. ND's Started with 35$ oil. I think u will c things pick up. Objectivity is not preaching. It's wisdom

1793 2018-02-27 20:02:20 You'll want to oil up for that.
1794 2018-02-27 20:02:17 Perhaps after the #HMCSCalgary fuel spill incident, marine oil spills should be added to your list of immediate threats requiring emergency measures.

1796 2018-02-27 20:01:44 Income taxes have zero impact on gas prices.  Oil is a commodity that is traded on a Global Market.  It is supply and demand that impacts gas prices.  If you explained to someone that gas prices went up because of a tax bill, you did them a huge disservice.

1975 2018-02-27 19:40:43 we probably have  different definitions: for me dreams induced by fiction are just that, where hope has to be based on a real ongoing process, not fiction. For me saying that a random uplifting story gives hope is not different from listening to a snake oil salesman. delusion.

2076 2018-02-27 19:30:40 I am sure it has a great culture and the people are wonderful..but I would be more interested in meeting the authentic shamans in the Amazon when I get down there. But I wonder if there are any left with the invasion/pollution of western culture:)
2077 2018-02-27 19:30:28 Yep.  I get a real kick out of fans that think he is lying or creating "smoke screens" to be crafty.  Sorry, he is not that smart and it is certainly not in his nature to play mind games.  He is going to pitch the snake oil and tell you what is made out of it too.

M: Okay, I will. *drives to a full-service gas station*

2080 2018-02-27 19:29:56 Gimme that oil for my life
2081 2018-02-27 19:29:53 Everyone’s melanin is just popping in the sun today. But me I just look like friend plantain fresh out the oil. 
2082 2018-02-27 19:29:43 Mine was like that too!! After I cut it I’ve ben doing coconut oil & ill leave it over night & wash it in the morning & it does wonders
2083 2018-02-27 19:29:29 Spill deplorable, but at least it gets experts other than myself to highlight the threat marine oil spills represent to local orcas. One of many threats, admittedly, but a significant one nonetheless.
2084 2018-02-27 19:29:21 Apparently now Jamaica has two "oil seeps" - so I hope we are watching carefully...

2086 2018-02-27 19:29:09 Considering the tax cuts started in the Harper years you'll have to ask the CPC. Then the over reliance on resource pricing (read: oil) in my opinion was gov speculation gone WRONG. Somehow Canada fared well during the recession but we actually did WORSE when it was over in 2010.
2087 2018-02-27 19:28:58 Great Thread, thank you for sharing SFFH 

And I concur, when I saw Tillerson, Mnuchin, Ross, Haley installed, it had Big Oil written all over it 
2088 2018-02-27 19:28:56 Boiling oil or lump of heavy masonry should prevent reoccurrence
2089 2018-02-27 19:28:53 Thanks. Was talking about the gowon era not 1958 though. Felt like they would have let the 'biafrans' go if it wasn't also a tussle for resources. Oil to be precise.
2090 2018-02-27 19:28:47 So u think they don't need engineers on an oil rig?  #smugmuch
2091 2018-02-27 19:28:42 How is our PM so anti business?? I see it with so many of his proposed regulations (oil, lithium, asbestos...) Trudeau needs to understand that the Canadian economy needs a boost not a short
2092 2018-02-27 19:28:40 He regrets how he handled the interview or he regrets his intransigent position on oil & gas drilling?

2109 2018-02-27 19:26:41 If it's a National STATE Park, then wouldn't the state have a right to say no to Trump's expansion on drilling oil in their parks?? And because all parks are public, wouldn't the people have a right to fight against this and win?
2110 2018-02-27 19:26:41 I just put a cup or two of vinegar and about 10 - 20 drops of essential oil. On a hot cycle!

2117 2018-02-27 19:24:39 Today I got to love on my favorite Golden Retrievers as my car's oil was getting changed and that's the story of how I've had the absolute best Tuesday ever.

2124 2018-02-27 19:23:54 Agree  but unlike the mythical cure-alls of yore, the snake oil Trump sold was composed of racism, misogyny, and nostalgia for the time when the primacy of the white male was unchallenged.  Powerful stuff, unfortunately.
2125 2018-02-27 19:23:45 I could stand to see us conserve our natural resources. Producing? Great for the oil and gas companies. Conserving? Good for us all. 

Remember: You can't say "conservative" without saying "conserve."
2126 2018-02-27 19:23:44 I'd loveto go product-free eventually. For now I just use @DrBronner hemp soap for everything and coconut oil as moisturizer.
2127 2018-02-27 19:23:38 Thank goodness! Artificial colours and flavours are both petroleum based - made from oil!!

2142 2018-02-27 19:21:50 Look at fisheries catches in Hawaii, they didn't decline by a single pound since the expansion of Papahanaumokuakea. Fishers are catching the exact same fish further out (burning more oil). Now tell me how the expansion is helping fish or humans.
2143 2018-02-27 19:21:30 Edmonton is short on dealable assets. Their 1st is too valuable this year (and next year is an unknown). Tough spot for them to be in. Need to fill in the team but no easy way to do it. Continuing fun times in Oil Country.

2152 2018-02-27 19:20:04 i would say its because of security problems in Kirkuk. Theyve recently atopped trucking oil to Iran because of Security. Maybe this is a way for Baghdad to retain some funds.
2153 2018-02-27 19:19:58 It’s not long till more groups as this one starts to challenge it. It’s clear the GOG have no idea what they’re walking into. Everyone’s basically fascinated by the “oil” and the “Money” it will bring to Guyana.

OF course one has to use common sense, but people (poor or rich) are very educated there. Great culture.

2210 2018-02-27 19:13:48 Many FTSE 500 chief executives and business leaders around the world recount a new mantra: “data is the new oil”.  The fact is, oil is a finite fossil fuel, while data is infinite.
2211 2018-02-27 19:13:20 Dad give me oil for my back from like a Chinese medication shop. Backs been so sore for days (cause of an old accident) no amount of painkillers or baths would help. This oil is the best thing ever backs so tingly and free of pain 
2212 2018-02-27 19:13:12 Good for him bt I fear da oil cee-c is boiling for him
2213 2018-02-27 19:13:09 Watching new Queer Eye over lunch & they seem to be using a lot of beard oil. I still have to use zit cream though so I may not be a good judge.
2214 2018-02-27 19:13:06 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
2215 2018-02-27 19:13:05 Cars should not be allowed to tweet. Go get your oil changed.

2218 2018-02-27 19:12:48 mom told me, rip.

if u wanna take them off at home, just file/buff off the top layer first, soak in hundo p acetone for 15 mins, and then oil your cuticles after, cause the acetone dries erryting out
2219 2018-02-27 19:12:47 i rhink its generally the oil that ends up being the issue..   so most schools just got rid of it
2220 2018-02-27 19:12:46 Good. Let Jones roast in his own snake oil. You own him

2222 2018-02-27 19:12:37 No.  To use your analogy, the point is that cars will continue to be rear ended, regardless of who is at fault.  In this case, the "car' is a pipeline full of oil at high pressure.
2223 2018-02-27 19:12:35 Why does it always take forever to get your oil changed
2224 2018-02-27 19:12:31 Glad you had a good trip..beer looks cool..one of these days I want to get down there or Peru for a nice Ayahuasca drink.:)
2225 2018-02-27 19:12:29 Good. Alex Jones made his fortune spreading lies, stoking fears, and selling snake oil. He's an evil man if ever there was one, and the sooner America turns its back on him, the better off we'll all be for it.

2229 2018-02-27 19:11:49 Ask any questions if you wish. Now.....back to oil. I made a little bit off the rise from last week, as I left a small long when Big Blue came up. I just sold it for a small profit. I see the notebook doesn't work anymore. Is there a problem or anything? Where are we at now?
2230 2018-02-27 19:11:38 Slow one in the group here...so, other than oil companies, who?
2231 2018-02-27 19:11:35 Too bad about the spill, but at least it is drawing attention to the threat marine oil spills pose to local orcas. Just one of many threats these endangered creatures face, of course, but not to be under-emphasized.

2243 2018-02-27 19:09:37 Yeah my sister uses Vaseline and castor oil and her eyelashes are perfect 
2244 2018-02-27 19:09:37 Pres. @MBuhari's govt has done well in the area of economy. It has raised external reserve to $42bn from $29bn within almost 3 years with falling oil prices.
Nigeria's economic growth rate also rose from 1.4% to 1.9%. FG should ensure that citizens feel the impact of the economy.

2267 2018-02-27 19:07:18 Nor would you buy his snake oil, like so many of the haters who are responding to you. Jones and his ilk are beneath you - focus on healing, supporting your friends and family, and whatever else you need to do for yourself. Be well.
2268 2018-02-27 19:06:58 Rail is a private company out to make money. How would you feel if the government told you, that you had to grow 30% of your acres to winter wheat and you could only sell it for X number of dollars??? That's what they do for rail. Oil pays more,  it's all about money
2269 2018-02-27 19:06:56 True,, though there is more commonality with Israel due to Jews having lived with and functioning with the West while Arab culture is radically different than Western culture. Arabs until recently were relied on for oil but that is becoming less of a necessity

2291 2018-02-27 19:04:28 You are stereotyping. That marketing is no different than the ladies holding up a can of motor oil or oil filters in an auto parts ad. And I'm willing to bet it is not as commonplace today. Open eyes will see more ads targeting women.
2292 2018-02-27 19:04:15 Stay away from leave-in conditioners (water's in them), use oil, and wrap it at night.
2293 2018-02-27 19:04:13 @Benwardle1 I'll just grab popcorn and let you two fight over it. I've prepared the body oil and mud pit!
2294 2018-02-27 19:04:00 Heating oil was meant to be delivered today. It wasn’t. Yet. I expect they are busy. Tank is very low…
2295 2018-02-27 19:03:34 I’ve gotten them twice and they ruined my eyelashes so bad. They took out most of them and now my eyelashes aren’t cute so I have to wear fake eyelashes. But I used castor oil and it helped.
2296 2018-02-27 19:03:23 Classic pot roast. Brown the meat first in a little olive oil than take it out and put in the vegetables. Onions, shallots, garlic, carrots and whatever else you fancy. Fry that all up then add water, a little flour, salt pepper, thyme, parsley and any other herbs you like......
2297 2018-02-27 19:03:19 There was no oil in 1958. There was groundnut pyramids and cocoa and coal
2298 2018-02-27 19:03:17 One of the more glorious memories of 2014 was the sight of Patrick Harvie trashing his own party's USP by having to support the *$113 ooor oil& we'll be loaded, man* lines handed to him by the SNP...

2300 2018-02-27 19:02:43 I am agreeing that more research has to be done is that we are not ready to transition in the meantime oil is still our main income and source as alternatives are no where near able to sustain the demand.

2398 2018-02-27 18:51:40 It's a metaphor, you enormous cyst. To call someone a snake oil salesman is to imply they are a con artist, promising solutions when what they're selling you is piss in a bottle.

2402 2018-02-27 18:51:30 The reason for that probably lies somewhere with the fact that while the Regime Change Wars have indeed been catastrophic for the countries on which they were inflicted, they’ve been an absolute boon for the careers of their pundit promoters & profits of Arms & Oil companies.

2633 2018-02-27 18:21:39 Dairy products all went up 50c to $1. Propane went up a buck a gallon.....and healthcare premiums just doubled. There is no extra in the bank acct. Trump is killing our Dairy farmers and Big Oil is price gouging us.
2634 2018-02-27 18:21:37 They are in favour of a carbon tax for an obvious reason. They operate globally, and globally carbon taxes are in effect or being put in effect everywhere because people want them. Which affects share prices and revenues. Oil Co's want to be on the right side of public sentiment.
2635 2018-02-27 18:21:32 To console those who mourn in Zion, To give them beauty for ashes, The oil of joy for mourning, The garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; That they may be called trees of #righteousness, The planting of the Lord, that He may be glorified.”

2636 2018-02-27 18:21:21 I can't wait until the Democrats lose the 2020 elections because aliens filled our heads with ridiculous anti-capitalist ideas, that's going to be a fun period on twitter. "Everybody loved oil pipelines until The Greys got to the left"
2637 2018-02-27 18:21:12 how long does a gram of oil last y’all
2638 2018-02-27 18:21:08 I thought isofix was optional on those? Unfortunately the last time I was car hunting it was on rather short notice, and shorter search radius (I had a suspicion my extant car was going to, in the words of a mechanic... "piss oil everywhere" fairly soon) so I got a Mazda 6

2640 2018-02-27 18:21:07 I swear you can't trust mechanics. You go in for a simple oil change. And come out with a recommended services bill of $1000. Like wtf. 
2641 2018-02-27 18:21:07 Fire paper, bombs, and oil are your friends my dude.

2643 2018-02-27 18:20:58 Of course. But the system can work. The balance between enterprise and socialism is emergent - the system is as socialist as the system can handle. Norway will be less socialist once the oil is gone but they are not likely to go full anarcho-capitalist, either.

2657 2018-02-27 18:19:12 That's not even close to accurate. It doesn't include the destroyed land/forests, footprint to construct. Coal is the worst by far.

2660 2018-02-27 18:18:55 Can't use the bolívar to buy Petros. Can't redeem Petros for cash. The price of the Petro is tied to the price of domestic oil in Venezuela. Does anybody own these? Can anybody own these? Why would anybody own these?

2676 2018-02-27 18:16:09 Interesting sale in light of the ongoing issues the oil and gas and pipeline industry perceive they may have in dealing with an increasingly erratic set of regulatory hurdles and regulators in the Canadian federal and provincial governments. #cdnpoli
2677 2018-02-27 18:15:53 We ate whale meat in the UK after WW2. It was good. There was rationing & not much else, so it had to be. Edison's electric light was a major factor in saving the whale. Whale oil replaced dim tallow candles & hugely improved reading at night, electric light simply replaced that.

2714 2018-02-27 18:10:46 It's 100% true. McMillan knew that EEC meant end of UK sovereignty way back in 1961. Original plan agreed by Heath was monetary & economic union by end of 70's - oil crisis killed that off.

2733 2018-02-27 18:09:20 Yea, and I had to agree when I heard this yesterday as a lot of tools that the industries are using right now are fed by oil. If industries have to give up the oil, it also means that they have to give up their tools and update them with even higher cost. #ENVIR491

2770 2018-02-27 18:04:47 …I realize you're from Iowa but you have to realize ethanol is a bust as a fuel…it ultimately drives up costs & is rough on equipment…artificially inflates corn prices, beef prices, shipping costs…ethanol can be made from oil too…

2775 2018-02-27 18:03:57 It's from Grounded seeds, dry fruits and nuts also you can add an Olive oil or Haney, Similar to Granola
2776 2018-02-27 18:03:45 Seen this before, people rev the crap out of them until the clutch catches fire, or the engine blows and you get an oil or much rarer a fuel fire.

Easy for me to say, but winter tyres are the way forward. I only put them on my front (driven) axle, cost just £64 for the pair.

2779 2018-02-27 18:03:01 So I use baby oil for skin care, obviously. And today at work one of my old folks told me not only did I look like a baby, I smelled liked one. 

I think that was a compliment. Still mulling it over.

2800 2018-02-27 18:01:22 It's a lot more likely that the country slashing its education budgets and selling itself right-wing snake oil for the last 30+ years produced millions of morons. Reap what ye sow and all that.

2802 2018-02-27 18:01:16 Fair enough point from @KateHoeyMP on the explosion of interest from her fellow MPs in Northern Ireland. We would have to be a troubled region in the middle east with fucking stacks of oil to beat this rat flying up the drainpipe.

2810 2018-02-27 18:00:11 Should not be on the back of citizens. WV charges lowest severance tax than any other oil/gas state because big oil pays off WV politician$, (who are highest paid in nation to WV lowest paid in nation). Raise the severance tax and the state can afford to fund PEIA.
2811 2018-02-27 18:00:05 This is evident.... I was impressed with the lavender oil selection..

2813 2018-02-27 18:00:01 When Wan Li's first daughter Duo Duo was born six years ago, the oil painter was unprepared to be a father. But his two daughters are now his inspiration and he now sees himself as "a painter for daughters".
2814 2018-02-27 17:59:59 Well, not that scary if you've been around in 2008, just multiply the effects by the number you feel appropriate. Last time the market truly doubted the dollar's purchasing power we saw oil spike to $150. $300 sounds outlandish today but is it possible? You betcha.
2815 2018-02-27 17:59:58 So people can get their oil changed.

2819 2018-02-27 17:59:31 Seems like a great opportunity for David to come out with a  brand new product. Just hit the market and boy is it moving fast. It's a new oil that you can rub all over your Youtube account to immediately defrost it. Order now before end times.

2826 2018-02-27 17:58:56 People's opinions are allowed to change over time. Fela Durotoye will not lose my support (which he really doesn't have) simply because of his opinion in 2014 on oil subsidy removal. I'll need to hear him defend his new position.

2828 2018-02-27 17:58:54 What?  No snake oil?  What else is gun control?  Snake oil for disarming the people.  Keep it up.  Your motivating thousands more, like me, to join the NRA.  Stop fooling yourself. #Jonesbrandsnakeoil

2837 2018-02-27 17:57:58 Yep. I just substitute the butter for coconut oil. The best part is that apart from decarbing and straining, there's really no work to do. I'm going to get a machine to compare results, but this works for me for now. There are lots of tips online. I'll go look.

2842 2018-02-27 17:57:34 Some swear by astragalus...I'm yet to try it (@owharvest has it organic). I do the usual 833% C + 175% DV Zinc daily regimen. However, I do think Antarctic krill oil (from @Onnit) helps. I take half-dosage due to so many other Omega 3 sources.
2843 2018-02-27 17:57:20 Someone else claimed that monopolies do not form without government regulation or collusion.

I said that wasn’t true and gave Standard Oil as a counterexample. Because it is.

(90% monopoly or 99% monopoly hardly matters in this context. There has seldom if ever been 100%.)

2848 2018-02-27 17:56:56 So interest rates, low inflation, weak earnings, low industrial output, China, oil prices and worries about brexit. Rather varied picture so why didn't you say so in the first place?

2854 2018-02-27 17:56:34 I wish I knew what to say to this. It leaves me wanting to talk about bio oil. But to be honest, I don't know anything about it, so I'll struggle to do that.

2857 2018-02-27 17:55:59 Very true! One of the most flagrant incongruencies of the ‘Bolivarian Revolution’: increasing citizen insecurity notwithstanding record state oil revenues.
2858 2018-02-27 17:55:49 Nope, saw it coming a mile away.  These politicians can retire on the money they get from the NRA, Oil, and Koch Bros alone.  Plus, we still pay them a pension for all the work they've done for their donors.  It's  an f*n racket!
2859 2018-02-27 17:55:44 I may have to put expand my research. Control VS  Oil Submersion VS water cooling. Ill provide the documentation on setup, investment, change in energy consumption and ultimately ROI. Send me some specs you would recommend for the water cooling ;)

... countries did with an exception of having oil to sell and more money to buy new technologies faster.

A kingdom fall cost trillions of dollars. A Republic system refreshes every 4 years and costs less blood and money to fall.
...
2865 2018-02-27 17:54:52 Few are paying attention. It's odd b/c everyone is focused on inflation. Whenever inflation arises, oil price increases & then, interest rate increases preceded it. Not hard to connect those dots since oil price affects all costs of doing business. Economists see it in reverse.
2866 2018-02-27 17:54:49 lol teacher “smell your fingers, does it smell like oil or pussy?”
2867 2018-02-27 17:54:43 Look to oil for clues. Indexes seem to be tracking it
2868 2018-02-27 17:54:41 They don't tell you that she totaled 8 cars, forgot to change the oil in 4 more cars and caused the engines to seize and got rid of 3 of them because she just didn't like the color. So the car she finished in was #16.

I just eat my oil with a spoon or put it in my coffee now.
Glad that you have someone looking out for you.
The lp oil was crap for me. I think they use low quality cannabis.
2879 2018-02-27 17:53:33 America should be working hard to use sustainable and clean energies such as wind, water and sun. Gas and oil only continue to damage our planet.
2880 2018-02-27 17:53:26 Because it's legal in Alaska, I'm able to purchase cannabis, boil it down with 120 proof alcohol and make Rick Simpson oil. My mom is off of 90% of her meds!! Praise God!! #Parkinsons
2881 2018-02-27 17:53:25 Bio oil Franka?
2882 2018-02-27 17:53:20 There are signs of movement by some utilities to target oil/promote EVs. Having said that, utilities that get a return on rate base are not incented to be aggressive. If sales are flat, return is about same. If sales fall, leading to under-earning, then file yearly rate cases.
2883 2018-02-27 17:53:17 Budget? Y do LIBS hate West CAN energy?   1) E. Canada transports, 3X to 4X more oil on ocean than W. Canada  and 2) E. Canada drills for oil offshore, West NOT  +  3) E. Canada still IMPORTS 700,000 bbl/day  foreign oil  ... NOW $10B for NS LNG... We all lose $Billions/yr  SAD
2884 2018-02-27 17:53:17 I won't profit from the pipeline at All, so that point is mute. Why wouldn't you want Canadian oil shipped to new markets overseas? Instead of corrupt countries blood oil. If we leave it in the ground, where will the money come from to fund new technologies?
2885 2018-02-27 17:53:14 Nooooo!!!!! We will miss you @patmaroon. Best of luck in Jersey. I mean this but let's be real, I'm still gonna cheer for the Oil. Maybe one day you'll be back to grace us with your smile again

2900 2018-02-27 17:51:50 None of the above in my opinion,it’s lack of communication by the directors,lies about placings,missed timelines, rubbish PR,dodgy Nomad, Slovenian politics, Carvers conflict of interest with PB and having an accountant running an Oil & Gas Company instead of an industry expert.

WV has fallen (over 150 years) further into poverty - we can’t afford teachers, public employees or affordable PEIA since big oil/gas bought our WV politician$.  Increase the severance tax to 7.5 WITH NO FAVORS, NOW! #WVStrong #55strong
2902 2018-02-27 17:51:34 Heating  ice caps... where should we start?
A. Changes in tectonics --ver by NASA (also in Midwest)
B. Underground Russian bases --ver by DOD
C. Geoengineering to reduce ice depth to make easier access to largest ever oil
D. GeoEng to create NW Passage

2914 2018-02-27 17:51:08 You Narco Rubio, bribed corrupt NarcoSenator, tell your bribers bosses of the oil industry that the Venezuelan oil belongs to Venezuelans, not to them and for more that they are trying to destroy the Venezuelan economy, they will never put their dirty hands on our oil @marcorubio
2915 2018-02-27 17:50:39 Yes you are selling snake oil to the masses. Your entire ‘platform’ based on anti-American rhetoric is snake oil.

2919 2018-02-27 17:50:28 How many solar-powered boats do you know?

If a cargo ship spills its fuel, let alone any cargo, that's thousands of metric tons of heavy oil or diesel into the water. Unacceptable, no? Or is diesel better for the fish than what's in the tanker?

Can't risk it. Close all ports.

2937 2018-02-27 17:48:20 We've had pipelines and tankers for years. It's time Canada stood up for it's natural resources and refined them on our land. Oil, lumber etc., we need to stop being sold out by our politicians and foreign corporate profits.

2966 2018-02-27 17:45:10 We can already achieve <0.1$/kwh including battery storage with current technology. As you probably know, the cost of solar, wind and batteries not about to stop dropping.

2967 2018-02-27 17:45:08 Health Tip Of The Day: Stop consuming coconut oil. Most people aren’t aware that coconut oil is a saturated fat...it also contains 125 calories per tablespoon. Much better of sticking to mono & polyunsaturated fats!

2974 2018-02-27 17:44:53 It all comes down to Russia in the end. A force for chaos in the world - in Syria, Iran, Brexit and with Trump.

The sooner Europe gets off Putinocrat oil & gas, the sooner we can help the Russian people democratically change their Government.

Maybe just sell snake oil. It's where your profit is.
3018 2018-02-27 17:39:35 Boots or no boots, I still have issues with the elusive Ted Cruz. First, If you want to talk about Big Milk or Big Perfume you’re on the wrong feed. A simple glance at the article clearly shows Ted Cruz talking about Oil Companies; I looked again no mention of milk or perfume.
3019 2018-02-27 17:39:34 Your pipelines are not for domestic use. Communities around the leaky pipelines pay the risk so Suncor can make a profit. It's ridiculous. BTW, I could live with the obligation of using Canadian oil during the phase out of fossils. For this, we don't need extra pipelines.

3040 2018-02-27 17:37:04 And in terms of risk, as I mention in the piece, a central bank is far less likely to be procyclical under NGDPLT. Even though they're not supposed to look at it, the price of oil in June 2008 became a much more serious macro issue when the Fed overreacted to it.
3041 2018-02-27 17:37:03 Yes your selling snake oil
3042 2018-02-27 17:37:02 Shit you not I've 8k miles on this oil and my jeep hasn't used a bit and is still light colored so I'm like fuck why change it
3043 2018-02-27 17:36:51 Someone remind me what the"normal" routine is for a "typical" person on oil changes & tire rotation for a car. Every 3-4 weeks here we are again.   #circuitriderlife

3047 2018-02-27 17:36:31 I've called Gov and state road on this road in WV they all told me to drive carefuland that they didn't have any money to fix the roads.I told them the big oil bonds the roads out to fix damaged roads not raising taxes to fix roads big oil tore up
3048 2018-02-27 17:36:22 Ecuador Oil Minister says the country is in talks with OPEC to add new crude production this year, despite current supply cut agreement #OOTT
3049 2018-02-27 17:36:16 It's amazing how being on hold and hearing a business' advertisement while on hold for someone instantly makes me feel like i'm back in the suburbs waiting to get my oil changed.
3050 2018-02-27 17:36:11 @WVGovernor The roads and the teachers can be taken care of by the oil and gas companies. We are sitting on billions of dollars in WV and everything we need is a drop in the bucket to what the profits of the oil and gas industry makes!
3051 2018-02-27 17:36:08 Like it or not, Alberta tar sand oil ranks among the most polluting in the world. Like it or not, only the cheapest oil will survive during the fossil fuel weaning phase. Meaning: Not Canadian.
3052 2018-02-27 17:36:04 Waiting for an oil change is so borning lmao

3055 2018-02-27 17:35:54 To be very fair this is not the fault of the car repair place.  I just assumed it would be an oil change and tire rotation and I could get over to our lovely, gourmet @SASsoftware cafeteria.  
Darned alignment.  Darned fuel injector.

3059 2018-02-27 17:35:22 When the S&P (AMZN) has more influence on the price of crude, than OPEC+, API, EIA, IEA, you know reason has left the building.  The tray-derzzz control the price of oil now, until something shinier comes along. #oott
3060 2018-02-27 17:35:08 With one of the key drivers being the dollar, oil prices had their strongest January in 5 years.

You've spread bullshit, poisoned the minds of the vulnerable to sell quack products, and hurt the lives of shooting victims.

You deserve this.

3066 2018-02-27 17:34:19 My god if I had known that i woulda brought my jeep to do an oil change since I haven't changed it since the last time I brought it there in February of 17
3067 2018-02-27 17:34:08 Yes. That's horrible. We must get ethical Alberta oil to market ASAP so the world can make immediate use of alternatives to backing these horrible regimes with their energy dollars.

3070 2018-02-27 17:34:02 This shows again the necessity of more Canadian refineries. We ship crude oil and have no capacity to refine. The dependability of US refineries is huge, we are in their hands.

3075 2018-02-27 17:33:27 The thing which causes irritation for some people is primarily related to  fragrance oil. Stick with essential oils, and bombs made from corn starch, bicarbonate and salts, and you should be fine. (Cite: Cosmetics Formulator=Me.)
3076 2018-02-27 17:33:16 3. Let fry basket hang on the fryer for 15-30 seconds to let some of the oil drain back in the fryer from the eggplant.
4. Transfer to a 1/6 pan.
3077 2018-02-27 17:33:12 One of most freq asked questions on #FrontierMarkets: “What is FM’s exposure to oil?”

My answer is 100%.

I think there’s too much focus on oil exporters. Investors miss a simple point: ALL are exposed to oil; some export, some import - and one can always position accordingly.

3097 2018-02-27 17:30:30 An aside, on tax paying, it's unfortunate Nigeria does not rely on taxes from the populace as highly as countries without oil wealth. That may explain some of the apathy towards poor governance. If the burden on oil was felt in our pockets we would be out in the streets more.

What should I grab for lunch?
3113 2018-02-27 17:27:58 I'm taking two painting classes, so my room reeks of this heavy oil paint vapor constantly and there's wet canvases strewn throughout the place (since oils take forever to dry). I don't think my room has ever been this much of a mess.

Honestly, I love it and hate it.

3118 2018-02-27 17:27:32 Having seen cowspiracy i would consider my self very knowledgable on the subject. Cattle ranchers should shut their mouthes and stop causing global warming. Cows are literally worse than the entire oil and gas industry.
3119 2018-02-27 17:27:27 Venezuela's foreign minister said on Tuesday that U.S. sanctions against the ailing oil nation are making foreign debt renegotiation more difficult and causing "panic" at global banks.
3120 2018-02-27 17:27:24 You ever wonder why years ago they made diesel more expensive then gas when it’s cheaper to make. Maybe to have all the diesel owners change to gas engines over the last 8 years to Create the we need to import sweet oil cause we need more instead of utilizing the cheaper diesel

3132 2018-02-27 17:26:15 We should see more national news stories about the dramatic failure of Trump-style policies at the state level.

Oklahoma, for example, cut down school weeks to just 4 days because they can't fund a full week. 

Why? Because their gov't refuses to cut handouts to the oil industry
3133 2018-02-27 17:26:12 Whoa! This one's quite a surprise. I never knew that #MustardOil is used in dental treatment. But now that I know, it actually makes a lot of sense given the powerful antibacterial properties of #Mustard Oil. Quite a germ-fighter, this!

3137 2018-02-27 17:26:09 I’d love to poll docs on what they define “low fat diet” as....Because the funny thing is, very few people are compliant w a low fat diet. They may be on a high carb, high calorie diet, but they’re mostly getting plenty of fat. Albeit not in the form of avocados and olive oil.
3138 2018-02-27 17:25:59 life at the moment is so stressful n weird. i am in a strange cycle. all i do is go to uni, read & write uni work, do uni research or occasionally drink rum n put coconut oil on various parts of my body for procrastination purposes.
3139 2018-02-27 17:25:54 Do people not realize that coconut oil is amazing for certain things but clogs pores?!

3142 2018-02-27 17:25:36 Must have something to do with the oil in the nut being compressed and the byproduct of oxygen and co2 mixing ...or something like that. Sort of like oily rags in a container going poof with the proper atmospheric conditions.

@davidhogg111
3144 2018-02-27 17:25:22 Not in the near future. The IEA doesn’t expect global demand for oil to peak before 2040, and Middle East oil is still abundant and very cheap to produce.

3156 2018-02-27 17:23:44 It's leverage. Only U.S. allies can have nuclear weapons, i.e.United Kingdom, France, India, Pakistan &  Israel. Saudi Arabia has long been an ally and like the U.S.opposes Iran which ironically sits in a geographic position to hinder nearly 40% of the worlds oil flow if provoked

3162 2018-02-27 17:23:19 An excellent summation. With the breakdown of the post 2nd WW 'Social Democratic consensus' following the first oil price shock in the early 1970's, neo liberal ideology has been used to make each of us responsible for 'risks' which had previously been considered 'collective'.
3163 2018-02-27 17:23:19 They have been for the last year plus and are presently without the tax credit but here's the thing ethanol got a tax credit for 25 yrs before it went away, oil still has one for over 100 years & biodiesel about 10 yrs so we need more time
3164 2018-02-27 17:23:09 In the grand scheme of things, it's not a huge deal but it's all about giving the organization the best pallet of assets to work from. Hence the problem w/ focusing on getting a player in return instead of taking the best possible return (draft pick).

3171 2018-02-27 17:22:21 During the first half of the 20th century #asbestos was used in factories, oil / chemical refineries, on railroad cars and in shipyards. Most notably the carcinogenic materials were used to insulate pipes and boilers in steam locomotives and to line tanks and ovens in refineries.
3172 2018-02-27 17:22:17 what are they risking their lives for? money? oil? right now we're not involved in some big international conflict so it's not like they're really "serving" anything but the interests of the gov't. I respect army vets more than some flag does
3173 2018-02-27 17:22:13 Holland & Barrett can't be the only place in the UK selling CBD oil. Anyone know anywhere else selling it
3174 2018-02-27 17:22:06 I bought an oil diffuser and salt lamp yesterday... my sleeping experience was next level.
3175 2018-02-27 17:22:02 They are giving £6.9 Billion year of taxpayers money  to the mega wealthy Oil & Gas industry as subsidies too and the uk film industry. all in all its an £85 Billion give away to their crony mates.
3176 2018-02-27 17:21:56 Wasn't "hundreds" killed.  US estimated total 100 dead, and many of those were Syrian. ISIS Hunters militia say in statement posted on their twitter feed, that they lost 25 (and that US attacked w/o warning while they were pursuing retreating ISIS fighters toward oil field)
3177 2018-02-27 17:21:55 I agree 100% but...why buy foreign oil products when we can utilize our own! As for Solar; it will be the future 4 sure! There is 1,100 watts of Solar power per sq. Meter from the sun, but current technology only harnesses 10% of it at this point! For now, we need Canadian oil!

3189 2018-02-27 17:20:50 @LinusTech Regarding the mineral oil parts, would something like isopropyl alcohol have been able to clean the mineral oil from MB, GPU, and other components. Is there any risk to just dunking that stuff in alcohol bath? Or can doing this damage other components?
3190 2018-02-27 17:20:49 Dude just told the class he puts coconut oil and butter in his coffee every morning
3191 2018-02-27 17:20:48 We'll keep our oil and water and fish and whiskey and you can take these nuclear bombs and shove them.
3192 2018-02-27 17:20:39 As if it's not the same oil we are selling. 
Nigeria.
Mtscheeeewww.
3193 2018-02-27 17:20:36 Maybe, but it would be harder to sell. Currently there is a consilience of interests between the Saudi connections and the Israeli ones. Far fewer will care about Iran v. Saudi, Iran's relationship with Syria etc. if there is no reason to secure the oil fields.

3200 2018-02-27 17:19:48 I love it. There's a "fried rice" blend bird's eye makes that is so so so good. It has bits of broccoli, carrot and green onion in it. Salt & pepper with a tiny bit of olive oil in a pan until tender and I don't even miss Chinese food.
3201 2018-02-27 17:19:44 This bio oil has my makeup flawless. My goodness
3202 2018-02-27 17:19:43 I need to get my oil changed
3203 2018-02-27 17:19:36 No, we need alternative energy to replace fossil fuels and we need to start that transition away from oil by investing today in what's going to replace it...not more oil infrastructure that's going to prolong the dependency. As Tesla becomes the #1 car manufacturer in the world..
3204 2018-02-27 17:19:22 Currently having a truffle oil sirloin with mustard mash, leeks, sautéed mushrooms, basil pesto and salad….and I can’t explain to you how incredibly delicious this is

3206 2018-02-27 17:19:16 Well, oil and gas, of course. And there are some complex political relationships btw them and utilities. But nothing that should stop utilities from aggressively advocating for what everyone agrees is the most impt opportunity for their entire biz model. It's very strange.
3207 2018-02-27 17:19:15 Cbd oil here too. I can't even take a paracetamol let alone anything stronger
3208 2018-02-27 17:19:12 Told peanut I needed an oil change. Woke up to oil change money. It’s simple.

3213 2018-02-27 17:18:56 Attempting to restrict supply of an-demand product benefits only the unscrupulous. Remember prohibition? Would you rather the world used OPEC oil?

Okey Doke.
3215 2018-02-27 17:18:45 Isn't it strange that OIL Companies want permission to drill wells and jeopardize our environment. What do we Americans get from their profit? Why not garantee a reasonable lower price for our fuel!!!
3216 2018-02-27 17:18:42 tapos papa tune up at change oil na din ako :3

3218 2018-02-27 17:18:20 Or in the case of middle eastern countries you'd actually be a bit closer to say "terrorist organizations". Though drug cartel is still an apt term, considering the main product to come out of countries like Afghanistan, outside of oil, is poppies, used to make Heroin.
3219 2018-02-27 17:18:15 most blacks already VOTED FOUR TIMES for OBAMA (twice each in 2008 & 2012 = #VoterFraud) based on that same hope and change snake oil ... and besides letting #BlackLivesMatter BURN DOWN some black communities &  inspire some #CopKillers ... what did they get for their votes?
3220 2018-02-27 17:18:05 Appreciate it oil spill love you too dawg
3221 2018-02-27 17:17:51 With the already bloated global oil market, advancing sales of hybrids, and expanding US production, isn't the future looking dim for Middle East oil exports?
3222 2018-02-27 17:17:35 Wait has anybody read the part of lesions bio where he drank chemicals, like oil. When he was 14? Doesn’t that make people a little worried about him having a heart attack mid game?
3223 2018-02-27 17:17:29 Like I can’t even schedule an oil change or go to the freaking dentist because I literally have NO TIME because I’m dealing with everybody else’s problems.
3224 2018-02-27 17:17:26 Algae isn't snake oil, it's like very tiny salad :) (It's not a miracle pill, cure, etc. but can make a nice run fuel.)
3225 2018-02-27 17:17:16 We're on it....oil has had a 100yr head start.
3226 2018-02-27 17:16:41 There's the potential for explosions and spills with oil. I think immediate impact for nuclear, in the rare event that there is a meltdown, is worse for us but oil and coal will trash the earth more and more, the longer we use them.
3227 2018-02-27 17:16:31 Mr. Pickens:What is the future of energy in general? Materials Sciences in terms of solar, wind, batteries, oil/gas extraction methods. Will the election of Donald T. help open up tech. which have been suppressed? Allowing us to be free from foreign oil? 0 imports from S.A.?

3246 2018-02-27 17:14:25 I also read somewhere on CBC that BC is more dependent on real estate than Alberta is on oil. Which speaks volumes. (But probably still not as dependent as NB is on Irving)
3247 2018-02-27 17:14:24 "Oil" is Norway, in Sweden we have the forest and hydroelectric. If you earn a certain amount of money you pay tax to your community AND to the State, we lucky bastards...
3248 2018-02-27 17:14:17 How about the oil refinery?
3249 2018-02-27 17:14:00 Isn't that kind of like telling you not to change the oil in your car ?
3250 2018-02-27 17:13:57 So stop buying Iraqi and Syrian oil. Build the pipeline expansion and use ethical Alberta oil.

You don't need to stop the pipeline to keep BC waters pristine. You need to ban commercial vessels in BC waters. Focus your energy on closing BC ports.
3251 2018-02-27 17:13:52 The chips provide a natural oil to the bread lmaoooo
3252 2018-02-27 17:13:52 In resource poor countries like Jordan and Morocco - definitely. In the Gulf States, renewables also help release more oil for export rather than domestic consumption. So hit and miss in environmental terms.
3253 2018-02-27 17:13:50 As #Germany starts a ban on diesel cars, we on the other side are still bragging while figuring out how to mine 'OUR' oil.

3267 2018-02-27 17:12:16 But it had scandal that is still embarrassing Nigeria today. Nigerians have had to suffer a Govt that is from HELL simply bcos you helped destroy our budding economy. An economy that was doing VERY WELL with oil patronage from the US
3268 2018-02-27 17:11:46 I asked you for examples of successful countries that expropriated land in masses. You give me one example of an oil reef that has nothing to do with land even.

Think of it like Alaska's annual dividend for oil reserves if you don't get that it's a reimbursement of bank theft. Or you could view it as your cut on patent royalties for expired patents since time began.

3276 2018-02-27 17:10:21 First of all, Alex Jones is no journalist.  He's just a "snake oil salesman", a conspiracy lunatic, and a very bad actor.  He's playing to those people in the "bubble" where no facts survive.  He just wants you to "spar" with him so he'll be relevant for awhile. Don't do it!
3277 2018-02-27 17:10:20 Coconut oil contains saturated fats and has had bad press because of this. In fact, 90 per cent of it is saturated fat! But this isn’t nearly as unhealthy as it may sound. Coconut oil is now considered to be something of a superfood due to its benefits for health.

3400 2018-02-27 16:58:23 Hm. Not sure about that. U.S. support for KSA is materially motivated, but support for Israel is partly ideological.

If the U.S. had no material reason to back the Saudis and co., they might still back Israel.

In short, absent oil, Israel becomes Greater Israel in a week.

3408 2018-02-27 16:57:26 My understanding is that the logistics of the oil field operation determine when CO2 is needed to "flood" the field. I don't know how readily CO2 can be stored until needed.

3410 2018-02-27 16:56:51 We have a little jug of oil we got from vendor at Alexandria farmer's market. It was expensive as hell, but they own their olive trees & it's ridiculously tasty. We don't use it to cook with but for things like bread dip, etc. so it lasts forever.

3451 2018-02-27 16:52:14 Why bother? Their ability to export oil is dropping every month, and us doing anything just gives them a tangible argument they can use to blame us for their troubles.

3455 2018-02-27 16:51:56 I'm don't Alex is even a journalist he is just an entertainer. Just a pathetic snake oil selling clown.
3456 2018-02-27 16:51:38 It's so hard to do. My mum is good at them but no matter how hard I try I can't. You have to get the right batter consistency and the oil/pan hot enough.
3457 2018-02-27 16:51:23 Got pulled over and the cop comes up to my window and tells me it smells like my car is leaking oil. Totally thought this was going in a different direction.

3459 2018-02-27 16:51:06 What helped me after I stopped was a good hair, skin and nail multivitamin and fish oil. They were brittle and peeling in layers prior to that. I like the OPI clear coat nail strengthener too or getting gel nail polish
3460 2018-02-27 16:51:04 Of course, but the adoption of fossil fuels did not stop the whaling fleets as oil was only one of the products obtained. Meat, bone meal, and high quality lubrication oil (spermaceti) where also produced.
3461 2018-02-27 16:51:03 Yeah I can't take opiates because they make me not able to urinate so I have to get cathed. No thanks! Also makes me scratch at my face in my sleep and itch. Cannabis oil is my go-to hehe (1:1 THC:CBD)

3468 2018-02-27 16:50:26 You are not a defender of the First Amendment, you are sick man with a big mouth and a small mind who makes his living selling snake oil and destroying lives. You deserve to be removed entirely from the view of civilization. YOU are a seditious traitor and a force of evil.
3469 2018-02-27 16:50:25 That’s nice, I swear by coconut oil once or twice a month overnight, works well 
3470 2018-02-27 16:50:23 Maybe we should build pipelines for Grain !   Since the oil takes up most railcars !

3475 2018-02-27 16:49:55 huy omg is that the oil spill :(
3476 2018-02-27 16:49:46 i TOTALLY agree.  USA and Saudi creating havoc in gulf region. But once Oil runs out, Saudi needs friends.

3487 2018-02-27 16:48:33 I think you could do something like this would keep you in mild ketosis:
All the leafy green vegetables you want to eat, starchy veg and fruits when they’re in season 
A ton of coconut and olive oil
Low to moderate amounts of whatever protein you want

3489 2018-02-27 16:48:22 Elect officials with zero ties to defense contractors, politicians who take zero corporate PAC money. Because the ones profiting out of death and suffering are defense contractors and in the aftermath oil companies that’ll privatize Syrian oil.
3490 2018-02-27 16:48:21 Following you isn't the only way to reduce dependence on foreign oil.

It's the lousy way to do it.
3491 2018-02-27 16:48:16 why d question on oil license? And why d response why not?
3492 2018-02-27 16:48:14 How mean!!! TMI!!! Get some coconut oil! Cook with it, swill your mouth first thing in the morning, use on your hair & skin!

3493 2018-02-27 16:48:13 Its a fact. If you have a problem with that its no my fault. The US bombing in Syria achieved absolutely nothing as it was designed to do. Not one ISIS oil convoy was bombed until the Russian intervention, not one.

3510 2018-02-27 16:46:30 Haha true.  IF costs nothing. Coconut and olive oil aren’t too expensive. But MCTs do work.
3511 2018-02-27 16:46:30 It achieves only one thing, giving the US soul control of North America oil market share! Enriching our neighbours as our health care, infrastructure all crumble under crippling debt that won't become noticeable to the public's til its to late!

3549 2018-02-27 16:42:27 It’s interesting to me that so many have no issues believing that there is a lot of $ behind the enviro movement financing an agenda, but we are sure that the billions spent by the Koch’s and big oil to deny climate change is just to educate us to the “truth” that it’s a scam.

3590 2018-02-27 16:38:05 i want some good olive oil to dip bread in

3592 2018-02-27 16:38:00 Found a really nice activity my toddler girl and I could do together regularly. Filled a bowl with coconut oil, olive oil, and sea salt. She dips her giant paintbrush in it and draws on me and herself while I exfoliate at the same time.Moms have to be creative.
3593 2018-02-27 16:37:44 Clove oil helped me with that
3594 2018-02-27 16:37:41 If H.746 passes three important and disastrous things WILL be stopped: 1) extension of Addison county pipeline; 2) gas fired power plant in Vernon; 3) Canadian co. Cannot send their dirty oil through NEK
3595 2018-02-27 16:37:36 More like you want he's oil money, why are you so much interested in creating a more inclusive and diverse Saudi Arabia? Is London not enough?

3598 2018-02-27 16:37:21 I'm sitting here in bed thinking about spicy fish in chili oil, knowing that I can't have it until Saturday. Nothing I eat until Saturday will make me happy.

3600 2018-02-27 16:37:20 but this can be managed if you've got multiple wells to play with and far field (i.e. away from injection well) much less impacted by short duration rate changes. Will all depend how critical field pressure is wrt oil:co2 miscibility etc.
3601 2018-02-27 16:37:19 I need to buy coconut oil for my face

3605 2018-02-27 16:37:04 Did a somewhat second big chop last January, now my hair is about a third of the way down my back. All I do is wear sew ins & braids for 4-6 weeks at a time and deep condition and do hot oil treatments in between.

3613 2018-02-27 16:35:26 @TheIndyBest Love a good face oil. Can't beat the relaxing feeling B4 bed massaging face oil (esp with lavender or bergamot). Anti aging..let me think about that..it's a natural process so can we help women learn 2 accept 'imperfection' & instead focus on healthiest look 4 them?
3614 2018-02-27 16:35:09 All of the above are anti science, anti environment, pro big oil, gas and mining $$$$$. Selling out wethepeople once again.
3615 2018-02-27 16:35:05 okay, it's over. I did not die but it was like drinking castor oil.

3626 2018-02-27 16:34:27 Agh so tired of hearing people telling me carbs are unhealthy, oil is fattening and snacks are bad for you 
3627 2018-02-27 16:34:21 But they are running out of oil ! Isnt that what its all about? So point one not valid.
Extra drivers is hardly an issue as long as they can import cheap labor, Indians who can drive still have drivers... so that aint going away.
3628 2018-02-27 16:34:15 Could you use some baby oil too.

3630 2018-02-27 16:34:01 Moaning about AB oil, pipes etc is pathetic  ... 1) E. Canada transports, 3X to 4 X more oil on ocean than W. Canada  and 2) E. Canada drills for oil offshore, ships it by tanker +  3) still IMPORTS 700,000 bbl/day  foreign oil  ...   PM should STOP kissing whiners asses
3631 2018-02-27 16:33:59 Mr. President with respect, this is not true. From 1999 through 2015, this country was not built with saliva, salaries were not paid with water, the election that brought you in was not conducted with speeches even drilling of more oil was not by policy statements but with money.
3632 2018-02-27 16:33:58 baby oil na quantidade "você está de sacanagem" acho que fica brilhando iUASBNRUIASBIRASBRu se nao for testa oleo de peroba igual o rex
3633 2018-02-27 16:33:57 That sucks. The last time I had Olive Garden, all of the oil separated out of the pasta and the cheese.

3646 2018-02-27 16:32:25 It was awesome. Olive oil drizzled on before serving and fresh cut basil too...it was fantastic. The reason it takes so long is because the owner (who is like 80) still makes every pizza by hand.

3653 2018-02-27 16:31:29 Oil pulling time. I must say after doing it yesterday, the tiny bit of discomfort that remained in my wisdom tooth only in the mornings, I did not experience at all this morning. So its zoing somethin

Wheres your line in the sand?

Are you yes yet , while you still can be?
3662 2018-02-27 16:30:23 remember that time i got CBD oil for my anxiety &then i lost it for months &my anxiety has been going wild &then i finally found it &never even used it again but it's IN MY BAG &I'M USING IT NOW
3663 2018-02-27 16:30:18 Boiling oil would be much better.
3664 2018-02-27 16:30:12 Corruption scandals in current and former administrations have exhausted people's patience. AMLO is the only one with a nationalism vision that can boost Mexico's economy. No country should give their oil for free especially if it represents a high % of their GDP
3665 2018-02-27 16:30:09 He approved it but didn't assume leadership over Alberta-Brutish Columbia clash.
So now wine & oil war. I support AB kicking stupid

3668 2018-02-27 16:29:28 And a good bit of that money goes back to the students becuz this state doesn’t give the schools much to begin with. The question you need to be asking is where is all the money from oil/gas going. Cuz it’s not going to supporting citizens of WV.
3669 2018-02-27 16:29:13 While world economists and Big Oil are dumping the tar sands, the renewable energy sector is booming...no pipeline/tanker busts there!

3678 2018-02-27 16:27:24 I can see England finding energy elsewhere, oil too. Agriculture, Manufacturing, Whisky Exports, water, meat etc are all available elsewhere. rUK has no trade deals though. Are you suggesting they would just starve, be cold, not drive cars etc? No single market, just one treasury
3679 2018-02-27 16:27:14 Why does the maintenance man always manage to show up when I have no bra on and a head full of coconut oil?
3680 2018-02-27 16:27:03 This president has degraded the WH! There needs to be blessed oil placed everywhere, all night intercessory prayer before another President is sworn in, before spending their first night!! He needs to go!

Clear position against the DIRTY ENERGY GOP.  You're from CA-fires & drought!! I don't get it. Pledge to refuse oil$
3693 2018-02-27 16:25:21 Time to hit them abs.
3694 2018-02-27 16:25:16 Our current Governor, Jerry, is pro oil. Wonder if @RL_Miller can get any of the candidates running for Brown’s job to commit to passing out oil production.
3695 2018-02-27 16:25:11 To describe you as a “shit journalist” is deeply offense to both journalists and shit. Snake oil salesman is just a factual statement.
3696 2018-02-27 16:25:10 Can you pass a drug test if you’re using pure CBD oil?
3697 2018-02-27 16:25:08 It is an abuse on the Grace of God and the Holy Spirit when a tongue speaking Christian goes around anointing things with Goya oil.

3703 2018-02-27 16:24:21 Pretty sure we aren't seeing any of that oil here
3704 2018-02-27 16:24:20 Out of oil so now I have to start rollin 
3705 2018-02-27 16:23:57 I would like to see the power to charge it come from American energy.  Much of our nation’s power grid has been sold to foreign entities. We need to power our own homes, businesses and transportation. It does us no good to get off of foreign oil, but onto foreign electricity.

3709 2018-02-27 16:22:48 You put oil in an oil lamp to be oil, functionally. 

You put gas in a car to be gas, functionally.

3714 2018-02-27 16:21:50 For years the government has been talking about diversification but NO they all want to dry oil first. Dubai is making money from Tourism.

3719 2018-02-27 16:21:25 unfortunately this isn't so easy. As long as we (politics) stick to central power plants (gas, coal, oil, nuclear, wind, water) the overall efficiency is poor - environmental damage high. Cleaner is decentralized (democratic?) renewable power generation.

3733 2018-02-27 16:20:05 Sure it won't be long now. Remember the ROC get a nice handout from this too. And with 89% GDP from oil / gas this will be a welcome relief to them. Thought we'd have more activity today though. #ZIOC chop chop  shake that booty

3738 2018-02-27 16:19:36 If UK gov had set up a sovereign wealth fund (even as late as 2010), its proceeds could have offset the declining tax income due to the oil price crash.

Besides, these companies are NOT making losses; they're busy handing out huge dividends to shareholders AT OUR EXPENSE.

3749 2018-02-27 16:18:40 So you are claiming that it is snake oil, and yet you are claiming it makes you THICC. You have literally contradicted yourself in the same sentence... 
3750 2018-02-27 16:18:28 Water is to oil like customer service is to a sore throat. They. Do. Not. Mix 
3751 2018-02-27 16:18:26 5. Vitamin E oil (or other antioxidant-rich facial oil) and do a facial massage around the bone to help the circulation.  I mean, I do it for my inuses to get the gunk moving, but it gets the blood moving too, and the darkness is pooling blood (eww, I know)
3752 2018-02-27 16:18:22 My god I just smashed a tube of oil literally everywhere. In public. Had to shamefully clean it all up 
3753 2018-02-27 16:18:15 Not much more annoying than pulling into @Ford Quicklane for an oil change and being behind a diesel. And so I wait.

3759 2018-02-27 16:17:17 Unfortunately at the time we were experiencing our 2nd recession from Harper government and oil did not hit its rock bottom price yet. It's nice to meet promises, but they are imaginary and arbitrary, more importantly is to run the country when new situations arise.
3760 2018-02-27 16:17:16 After it being 7 months past due I finally got an oil change. Happy adulting.

3806 2018-02-27 16:11:13 Don't be happy Kasthuri, Arabs badly want women to drive due to 2 reason: 1)The KSA economy is nose-diving due to oil fluctuations, more cars need to be sold. 2) Need women housekeepers who can drive as well as do household chores, in that way they don't need to hire extra driver

3827 2018-02-27 16:09:16 No haha.  That would mean 50% assuming soybean meal is husk only so the rest is used for oil or something.    Trying to account for the 98% figure and if it's really 98% of the entire crop production or only a large share of that 98%.

3831 2018-02-27 16:09:04 Again--IMO much more important to focus on the overconsumption of snack foods. Otherwise we will see sugar-free foods that are highly palatable, filled with veggie oil (or whatever), and nothing will change.
3832 2018-02-27 16:08:57 Wish I'd been the one to put the oil on lol xxxxxx

3835 2018-02-27 16:08:43 However, it is economic madness to *pay* oil companies to take away a finite natural resource. This is how the UK has squandered billions while every other oil producing nation in the world has a sovereign wealth fund.

3845 2018-02-27 16:08:04 I think they “work” as smell-good aromatherapy, but I’ve had so many snake oil salesman suggest I stop using “TOXIC” INSULIN for my daughter’s Type 1 Diabetes and use essential oils instead that I checked out. That is SO dangerous to say to people with legit medical needs.

3847 2018-02-27 16:07:44 let me think now, would Scotland be better off with complete control of all its oil and gas-fields & renewables, water, whisky, tourism & other massive resources servicing a pop of only 5 million, 
or tied to England,  spending money on Trident, HS2, WM, foreign wars, etc etc?
3848 2018-02-27 16:07:23 Sounds OK.  I may very well try a pair, although I'm currently trying out CBD oil and I should give that a fair evaluation before adding any extra variables in.

3895 2018-02-27 16:02:29 I was told too much natty gas in the mix. As well as they had a "conflict" that caused them not to be able to do a breakout session at the Dallas oil conference a friend attended. And that was disappointing b/c they didn't get to detail the story for investors.
3896 2018-02-27 16:02:26 It's for the filthy nations who does these things for oil, remember that the price you are paying today will make you suffer one day. If there is any God, this is to him to save Syria.

3906 2018-02-27 16:01:20 This should really make people stop and think why is there such a big push to move away from oil and gas. Lithium is not in huge supply, harder to extract and refine. Who is going to profit the most?

3923 2018-02-27 15:59:23 Article forgets to mention the pitential rebound effect of lower oil demand (and price) due to plastic reduction. Would be interesting to know if targets would mean an undesired overall increase in oil consumption
3924 2018-02-27 15:59:19 I am fkn loving these ideas. I use lavander oil for migraines / anxiety btw, and it does make a huge difference when I need to come down from a migraine episode. I can't get over the mix of honey and lavender in tea tho, it does sound like something I'd love

3927 2018-02-27 15:58:28 Trivia question. The meaning of this oil company's name is literally its logo. As in, the word for that particular shape, often seen on military uniforms, is what the company's name is.
3928 2018-02-27 15:58:27 Friend Lefty, as unemployment skyrockets downwards and as GDP continues to plummet upwards we can only look on at oil rich socialist Venezuela and think that could be us if the benevolent brother Corbyn only had a chance. Onward!

3930 2018-02-27 15:58:19 There were plenty of Progressives like English Labor leader Jeremy Corbin, Bernie Saunders, authors Naomi Klein and Noam Chomsky who held oil rich Venezuela a modern model for socialism and redistribution. They run and hide when Venezuela turned into a third world shithole.

3934 2018-02-27 15:58:12  True. And Westmonster wouldn't consult anyone on the flavour, they'd buy the cheapo roast beef (with Scots oil money) then gie us the crumbs from the bottom of the pack  - & then expect thanks. "What d'you mean you're not grateful?"

3943 2018-02-27 15:55:33 Of course I did. Twitter limits my characters. I sent a following Tweet that describes my take on orgs such as NRA or AARP and others that represent individuals (as opposed to a org that represents businesses- like oil companies). The orgs do what their individual mbrs want.

3946 2018-02-27 15:55:10 Mexican state-owned oil company Pemex reports a nearly $18 billion 4th-quarter loss after both crude output & processing slid, though the company says refining levels should rebound as major maintenance plans are completed #Oil #Mexico #Pemex #business

3953 2018-02-27 15:54:08 Those countries are morons because it's guaranteed that Venezuela will cheat them too. Venezuela's annual oil production has already been halved since before Hugo Chavez took over. It will probably collapse further
3954 2018-02-27 15:53:58 You can read the weather you can predict the price of heating oil. I think you asked me that because you think the final club that’s easiest to get into is the one where I’ll have the best chance.

4000 2018-02-27 15:48:02 I used to salt them and pat them down to draw out the moisture but that made them suck up even more oil when you fry them, so I chopped them and soaked them in cold water for 10 minutes instead. Then you pat down the excess on the outside so they don’t splutter in oil
4001 2018-02-27 15:47:54 Talking about digg’s article not yours.

4011 2018-02-27 15:46:44 You and your husband are on the right track, but remember we all turn to coal and oil. Realizing you just filled your tank with your loved one's remains really hurts.
4012 2018-02-27 15:46:37 Though he does deserve credit for challenging the foreign oil companies who were taking advantage of Libyan oil. He had some policies that benefitted most Libyans people early on. But Libyans and infrastructure remained poor, and he and his familly paraded his wealth.

4067 2018-02-27 15:41:25 Mainly gov't corruption. Crony privatization during the Jeltsin era. Doing Putin's bidding and getting juicy contracts in return. An upper class creaming off the rest of society, like in all corrupt dictatorships. Oil/gas revenue. Ordinary Russians get nothing.
4068 2018-02-27 15:41:17 It was for weeks before the indy ref but miraculously they found even more just a few weeks after. Sometimes it's even the wrong type of oil 
4069 2018-02-27 15:41:13 @JoeStGeorge @KDVR hello Joe, your Problem Solvers video was informative last night but I would like to see a correction in the title. It is not “oil companies” it was just one. Should be “tudex leaves oil sites without cleaning up”. Don’t blame the whole industry.
4070 2018-02-27 15:40:52 What we are seeing in the United States is pretty much what you'd expect if the government were taken over by an oil cartel.

4084 2018-02-27 15:39:15 alex jones is a snake selling snake oil. So, don't let that oily, greasy snake get under your skin. He's mindless; no intellect. There's no challenge there. So, stay the course.

Norway made a good decision on oil. But most decisions based on choices bet favorable outcomes. Different story when unfavorable outcomes added to the decision process.

4167 2018-02-27 15:30:30 A look back in time...in 1929, the company acquired riverfront land in Saugatuck which provided deep-water docking for larger coal and sand barges and, later, oil tankers. This building still stands today with an antique shop on the first floor and an apartment on the second.

I did see where they pointed out that spending close to 2 billion a year subsidizing a tens of billions of dollars a year industry is not necessary, and something the liberals campaigned against.

4276 2018-02-27 15:18:18 Norway is now gold-plated green which they afford due to excellent post-70s fiscal/market strategy. Norway kept ownership of oil & engaged IOCs as servants not masters.

4282 2018-02-27 15:17:51 Bill O'Reilly talking about press bias is like Jeffrey Dahmer promoting the art of cooking! There is an underlying narrative to the snake oil salesman that is appealing to the easily, willingly, eagerly misled target audience. Today only, two bottles for the price of one!
4283 2018-02-27 15:17:48 My movement towards the centre also played a part, at the time of IndyRef I was a naive left-wing idiot who though Venezuela was a good model for an oil rich nation to follow. 2/2
4284 2018-02-27 15:17:47 It's borderline criminal to spend all of the US oil reserves at a time when there's no need to do so - aside from the notion that the GOP wants to buy the presidency in selling off our security.
4285 2018-02-27 15:17:47 The 24k gold oil. It looks so amazing honestly. #honeyrosecollection
4286 2018-02-27 15:17:32 True! I i remember I went to Pep Boys for some oil, on the way home i heard a weird grinding noise. Turns out I had a metal,  something that looked like a nail file, sticking out of my tire

4288 2018-02-27 15:17:17 It’s not, because he’s selling you snake oil

4293 2018-02-27 15:16:10 do you believe it's because this administration wants the land cheap to drill for oil? That's the word on the street. Disgusting!
4294 2018-02-27 15:16:07 Oil changes, tire rotations, buying tires, alignments..

FUUUUUUUUUCK MAN..
4295 2018-02-27 15:15:47 Even if #nafta died, it is nearly impossible for me to imagine energy being effected, other then sentiment of less-informed crowd, also known as the majority.  Canadian oil imports to US greatly benefit Americans.  Any new costs would hurt US refiners/consumers.

4298 2018-02-27 15:15:25 @MeanwhileinCana - Your posts likely came from tides, right? The oil sector is not perfect, but is is also no devil. People like need to read beyond the radical groups as they know nothing either on the environment or economics. 

I bet your whole life is carbon footprint!

4305 2018-02-27 15:14:22 Fossil fuels are here to stay for at least the next 5 decades. There’s no reason why Canada’s oil, produced with higher safety and environmental standards than everywhere else, should be sacrificed for exactly zero benefit.
4306 2018-02-27 15:14:15 Someone told me that @MayorPugh50 plans to veto the CC vote against crude oil storage in Baltimore. Is that true?
4307 2018-02-27 15:14:12 I have only just seen. And now I can’t unsee. All you needed was some baby oil for the complete look! And that wasn’t an offer!
4308 2018-02-27 15:14:10 And then you've got to navigate the logistics of when the oil field needs the CO2 and when the facility is generating it.
4309 2018-02-27 15:14:10 I’m deeply disappointed in myself for being so overwhelmed by American politics that I’ve completely missed the Alberta pipeline expansion bullshit that’s going on in BC, and this wine ban that I thought was a joke is just big oil vs small business owners.
4310 2018-02-27 15:14:02 @realDonaldTrump Good day Mr Trump. I live in Alberta Canada. Our oil industry is being held hostage by our own provinces. Many of us are talking about separation. The Trudeau government has divided our country. We would sell the USA our oil .

4327 2018-02-27 15:12:37 Don’t get me started on the carve out on boiling oil. Once the food court vendors learned they could sell waste product to the crown as part of the defense budget the dietary guidelines mysteriously changed and most of the fruit / veggie whole food mongers went bankrupt.

4337 2018-02-27 15:11:44 Lol. One time I entered this bus going to Abuja from the east. As usual people packed rubbish. Gallons of palm oil were under my seat. Sat next to this old woman that kept throwing up. Then one gallon of oil burst and was all over. Throw up and palm oil mix is not nice to smell.

4359 2018-02-27 15:09:52 @maxfawcett The was an article years ago in Alberta Oil that explained why big refineries on the Gulf coast and in the Midwest could extract more $$ out of a barrel of crude than Canadian refineries. Had to do with all the other petrochemical products

4362 2018-02-27 15:09:29 Dear @RachelNotley :
we have known for decades that Alberta needs to diversify its economy. Adding $$$ to the energy industry to do more things is not in fact diversifying the economy as it keeps us on our oil $$ addiction.  Please fund diversification out of extraction industry
4363 2018-02-27 15:09:28 Thanks for the info yet can not disagree much more to you... Even technology needs standarts to compare one to another, in this case BTC might not be used due to its transaction speed but it definitely will be used as a currency over commodities such as brent, oil, gold, silver..

4. Bought Girl Scout cookies. 
5. Watched his kid play little league. 

This list could go on forever.

4402 2018-02-27 15:03:46 That took a huge scale. How many facilities where C capture is affordable (eg, ethanol, NG, fertilizer) would build a pipeline & negotiate a long-term equity deal with a nearby old oil field?
4403 2018-02-27 15:03:41 What do the Norwegians have that we don't? Not the oil. 

But every man, woman and child in Norway now has $200,000 each in an oil fund.
4404 2018-02-27 15:03:37 Too bad for most who won't get all the health benefits of coconut oil. Good for the rest of us, with less people buying, coconut oil prices should go down 
4405 2018-02-27 15:03:23 Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are the source guarantee for banks housing loans.

4417 2018-02-27 15:02:32 Hey @Take5_OilChange: I got my oil changed at the new Shreveport location yesterday, and now my brake light won't go off and my cruise control doesn't work. I went back, and no one there had any idea how to fix it. I certainly won't be using Take5 again.
4418 2018-02-27 15:01:52 Is olive oil hard on your stomach? They also have c-8 powder now which may be easier on the stomach but idk

4421 2018-02-27 15:01:40 So I used the old coffee grounds as a body scrub, pero walang oil. As is. Tengene medj matigas, natanggal yata epidermis ko bez. 
4422 2018-02-27 15:01:34 Whisk egg yolk with a tablespoon of olive oil and leave on hair for a few minutes before your shampoo. It makes a great hair conditioner.
4423 2018-02-27 15:01:34 Because it's Tex A@M lol. They can spend a billion as a tax write off with oil money but no one wants to pay there lol

4429 2018-02-27 15:01:00 Be careful with the stihl chainsaws! Mine was gripped with 10 hours of use and does not cover the warranty, for "poor lubrication", although I followed the instructions, with brand oil.

4431 2018-02-27 15:00:52 Our governments should invest in sending bahamian men and women off to train for jobs in the oil industry. So we can own all oil that’s barreled here. Train for the jobs of the future not the jobs of now
4432 2018-02-27 15:00:47 UK took NS oil income and cut taxes. Norway invested in financial assets for future generations. Norway by doing so transferred income between generations.

4443 2018-02-27 14:59:21 I liked the changes in cabinet but with a few reservations. I've kept a keen eye on the oil and the rand/dollar exchange rate. If the trend continues or even improves, I doubt that we will see the full fuel price hike in April for obvious reasons.

4448 2018-02-27 14:58:10 The GOP  never tax the rich & famous.  The hard work'n worker bees get taxed the most.  In Oklahoma, big oil get all the tax breaks & now they want to tax $1.50 a pack on cigs!
4449 2018-02-27 14:58:05 I'd go for a fragrance-free moisturizer (I just use Neutrogena) mixed with some rosehip oil (2-5 drops depending on the weather, dryness, etc)? I sometimes just pat some rosehip oil straight on my undereye then put moisturizer over it.

4485 2018-02-27 14:53:30 The oil from the tar sands is inherently pathetic. We are so addicted to fossil fuels we have to suck it out of the mud. It’s like an alcoholic sucking booze out of the carpet after he drunkenly dropped his glass.

4563 2018-02-27 14:45:25 In my analysis US #EnergyDominance strategy involves literally monetising shale oil reserves via Enron-style tripartite prepay. Saudi left BWAVE pricing 1 July 2017 & now USD has moved to #OilStandard Saudi Petro$ capital support oil price (as producers always do if they can)
4564 2018-02-27 14:45:22 Seven years after its creation, the Oil and Gas Leasing Commission (for extraction on state lands) is finally set to meet soon, on March 15. Kasich declined to name members until lawmakers came close this summer to taking away his appointment power.
4565 2018-02-27 14:45:21 Yes. Alberta sells the oil to the US, then BC buys it back from the US at an increased cost then BC wonders why they are paying higher prices than other provinces.

4570 2018-02-27 14:45:06 In the absence of a Wirecutter rec, I just bought a 4l T-Fal model with 3 baskets.  1800W is pretty powerful; it only took 15 min or so to heat 4l of oil. Much easier to manage temp and clean than stovetop.

4579 2018-02-27 14:43:38 @BruceHinkleyNDP just a quick note that the best upgrade your government could do for the oil is be voted out and have a responsible government voted in.  Look forward to seeing you on UI!
4580 2018-02-27 14:43:37 I wonder how you can be so far off in your undertanding of my comment. I support United Alberta and their stance, HATE ndp. JK is simply making the point that alberta IS diversified, no need to kill oil to increase diversification. Period.  Get it?

4596 2018-02-27 14:41:44 Not a big fan of protein shakes. I'd rather mow down 10 chicken wings+shake w/whole fat yogurt w/some fruits or 5 whole eggs w/cheese and veggies fried in olive oil.

I get angry w/o fatty foods. If I need to cut, I limit my carbs. IMO fats are more important than protein.
4597 2018-02-27 14:41:32 Is not marketers, is d corruption behind the FG govt and marketers that is holding Nigeria to ramsom. Think of it. Why is it that no govt agency is willing to either fix or build a new refinery 40yrs after the existing ones were built? Yet we are 6th largest crude oil producer

4599 2018-02-27 14:41:12 US will be world's biggest crude oil producer (11 mil bbl/day) in 2018. Bigger than Saudi Arabia/bigger than Russia. Creates lots of new high paying jobs in US/Keeps lid on oil prices (gasoline prices) as OPEC tries to cut production to force prices higher/Dem policies harm econ.

4605 2018-02-27 14:40:23 Twenty years ago Venezuela was called the Jewel of South America. Today the currency is worthless, they are importing crude oil, the people are starving. Gangs and the government are terrorizing the people that haven't fled. Don't say it can't happen here.

4607 2018-02-27 14:40:14 SNP said we could use the Uk pound and we would be rich with all our oil until of course the price plummeted anyway SNP are now committed to green energy not carbon based fuels. So a nod and a wink from low ranking EU civil servants about Scotland walking into EU is debatable

4609 2018-02-27 14:40:03 But it *would* be interesting to see what that hair looks like wet. Not to mention the spray tan oil slick shimmering on the surface, dancing orangely upon the waves.
4610 2018-02-27 14:40:02 Salmon and tuna are great

Salmon is especially great because when grilled, it produces its own oil, which has a unique delicious and tangy taste and texture in your mouth

I always have my grilled salmon medium, so it's crispy but not dry at all, maintaning tha juicy oily flavor
4611 2018-02-27 14:39:58 We just need to mine more coal, especially if we can destroy national parks and other public lands to drain the last drop for this current generation of oil & gas tycoons.

4700 2018-02-27 14:27:34 my mom knew that i was stressed so she came and pulled me out of class to rub peppermint oil on my wrists and the back of my neck

4704 2018-02-27 14:26:56 Kuwait already has universal income ( because of it’s oil $$$). Every male citizen (females are excluded of course-it is Kuwait) receives $100K annually.  Of course a large pool of labor force are immigrants and therefore not citizens & don’t get the income.

4714 2018-02-27 14:25:22 8 drops of lavender essential oil and pepperiment put in a spray bottle with 2cups of water. Spray all around windows and all doorways. All natural they will stay away.
4715 2018-02-27 14:25:10 The US is not "producing" oil, we are depleting our oil reserves. Producing implies an unlimited manufacturing process, but no new oil will ever be made. We should deplete everyone else's oil reserves before we start using our own.
4716 2018-02-27 14:25:04 OK, Republicans can pay for all email investigations, & for the US soldiers attacked by Russian mercenaries in Syria. Also pay for ALL cleanups of ALL oil spills and pay the medical & funeral bills of shooting victims.

4719 2018-02-27 14:24:26 US to replace Russia as world's biggest oil producer: By 2019 & possibly sooner, USA will become world's top oil producer, taking the place of Russia, the International Energy Agency said. US oil production isn't likely to reach its peak until 2020.—IEA Executive Director Birol.
4720 2018-02-27 14:24:21 Always been lots more oil. Peak oil never about running out of oil; it's about running out of cheap oil. Shift to producers as price-takers vs vertically integrated value-adders is key factor. 

Don't agree that price is capped. That's part of the silly infinite-cheap narrative.

4745 2018-02-27 14:20:36 But with oil you can compare prices with previous years. When was the last time someone gave you free oil and free money to buy more oil?
4746 2018-02-27 14:20:31 Since I turned 25, I have been hot on massaging Egyptian oil into my face daily (I try twice), I do not want any type of cosmetic surgery but Botox is nearly an option I swear 
4747 2018-02-27 14:20:17 I literally just use coconut oil or something as a moisturiser I don't buy products lol haha what aloe Vera is supposedly good too.
4748 2018-02-27 14:20:08 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
4749 2018-02-27 14:20:02 sage essential in the oil diffuser
4750 2018-02-27 14:19:55 "Why are the oil companies out looking for oil"

Holy fuck. You're a paragon of ineptitude.
4751 2018-02-27 14:19:54 All I needed was some coconut oil, don't worry bout the small things, I know I can do all things
4752 2018-02-27 14:19:44 as long as they oil companies make more money thats all that matters

4755 2018-02-27 14:19:16 ああオイル、どうして君はオイルなんだ…
4756 2018-02-27 14:19:00 Bottom line fromArtem Abramov from @RystadEnergy : even with constraints US tight oil can maintain 1 mbd of oil production growth year over year. Let’s see what RT Dukes from @WoodMackenzie days. #CSISLive

4758 2018-02-27 14:18:47 Well why are the oil company’s their then, wait a minute WM give them concessions to develope & produce the oil with no chance of any income from taxes, makes sense to WM

A yes vote would leave England looking after with no help from other countries resources for the first time in decades
4761 2018-02-27 14:18:12 And what about heating oil? It's gone up over £20.00 in two days which is blatant profiteering
4762 2018-02-27 14:18:11 Late to the party because a Conservative government that held power for more than 40 years lollygagged on ways (ie pipelines) to get our oil out the door. This isn't the NDP's fault, it's the Cons, 100%.
4763 2018-02-27 14:18:11 And then what happened? Oh yeah, the oil price crashed and SNP's White Paper was shown up for the utter toilet paper it is unworthy of being called such.
4764 2018-02-27 14:18:06 Trick #2: basic foods. My groceries are: tons of raw fruits/veggies, lots of dairy (milk, kefir, yoghurt, cottage cheese), raw fish/chicken, eggs, oatmeal, peanut butter, raw nuts (unsalted!), dark chocolate, dates, prunes, raisins. Olive oil. Goat cheese. And some wine 
4765 2018-02-27 14:18:01 Someone should please suggest something for my toothache , APART FROM CLOVE OIL! I'm done with that shit
4766 2018-02-27 14:17:57 On @BloombergTV this morning, Binky Chadha of @DeutscheBank made a key point: U.S. inflation has been low and relatively stable since at least 1995, yet key prices such as oil and the USD exchange rate have been wildly unstable.
4767 2018-02-27 14:17:50 Idk if this works for pigs or not, but putting corn oil in cow feed helps them eat. Why not give it a shot?
4768 2018-02-27 14:17:37 The natural oil your skin produces to keep your face from drying and aging quickly  haha
4769 2018-02-27 14:17:32 It’s like oil, when supply is low prices are high. When opec decides to flood market with reserves then prices plummet
4770 2018-02-27 14:17:22 Another anti oil fanatic, who will do everything possible to hinder anything to do with Canada’s oil production. Great job @jimcarr_wpg 
4771 2018-02-27 14:17:19 this used to happen to me EVERY SINGLE NIGHT!!! it was THE MOST annoying ever but what i found  helps is using an essential oil diffuser and putting lavender oil in it when you go go sleep

1 part vinegar (apple cider, red wine, rice)
+ 3 parts oil (EVOO, grapeseed, canola, vegetable)
+ salt & black pepper to taste
+ optional add-ins like fresh chopped (or dried) basil or thyme; minced onion, garlic or ginger; crushed red pepper flakes, etc.
4777 2018-02-27 14:16:54 Well right now I’m living in Hungary so I use this vegan Argain oil mask, this pomegranate and rose water toner and then if you’ve heard of the body shop I use their essential face oils and moisturizer

4787 2018-02-27 14:16:03 He an idiot. Successful eco-terrorist campaigns funded by US refiners have blocked pipeline projects to tide water and resulted in CND oil being severely discounted. We MUST buid pipelines to the coast and sell our oil to another markets at market prices!

4790 2018-02-27 14:15:46 Still lots of oil, but rising energy cost of extraction -> secular decline in EROEI. More expensive oil becomes more $ profit in saving it via energy as a service. So oil price now capped, while costs rise. Why else would Aramco etc divest & IOCs flip to gas/alternatives ?

4793 2018-02-27 14:15:31 Is this why we went to Iraq?,they were not using their oil properly so we step in and take it from them?
Any comment on UK giving tax breaks to oil companies,,actuall paying them to take the oil?,,meanwhile Norway makes 9BN
4794 2018-02-27 14:15:28 Why are we letting other countries surpass Canada with their energy diversification? We have one trading partner and import oil from other countries (no pipeline east for self-sufficiency), with zero ability to export natural gas, as other countries gas exports compound yearly.

4950 2018-02-27 13:56:22 Its the most difficult place on earth to extract oil hence the low profits and tax breaks to firms willing to try and get it. Its not like the middle east where it comes straight out the ground
4951 2018-02-27 13:56:22 Same in eastern coal fields. Company scrip, company store, company housing. Look at a map of eastern KY & southern WVa. Towns have crazy names. It was the name of the mine originally.

4954 2018-02-27 13:56:17 @GhettoRadio895 tell Bonoko we don't say "oiro" it's oil.....  Rhotacism (sound change), the sound change converting a consonant into an r-sound
Rhotacism (speech impediment), the inability or difficulty in pronouncing the sound r
4955 2018-02-27 13:56:05 Oil change today as well 
4956 2018-02-27 13:55:54 Denmark 2be independent of oil, coal & gas by 2050. Norway just froze it's 1tr$ fund for oil&gas. Kudos Madamouselle NoRdIC. XOXO.

4977 2018-02-27 13:53:00 @jaketapper  At the root of the Russian investigation is #oil from Ukraine oil fields. Ask Paul Manafort why the former CEO of Exon is Secretary of State and why Flynn and others were indirectly on Putin’s payroll prior to election. So Putin can be the richest man in the world
4978 2018-02-27 13:52:54 Weaver prefers killing of foreign Gays. Canada’s Gay friendly Oil at tidewater displaces dictator oil from regimes that throw  off Buildings. Protesting #KMX = killing #LGBT @kennedystewart
4979 2018-02-27 13:52:53 Lol funny how there’s a ‘significant reservoir’ of oil found in the North Sea. Mind in the build up to the referendum there was none. Well the new reserve could generate over £5b. The no vote was a good idea .
4980 2018-02-27 13:52:52 That’s right. Teens are too young to form educated opinions. But they’re not too young to be shipped to other countries to fight and die for oil, to sign up for tens of thousands of dollars in student loan debt, and not too young to purchase weapons of mass destruction. 
4981 2018-02-27 13:52:36 patchouli oil might be the answer then!:)

4983 2018-02-27 13:51:30 There are no lies here. Missed out on an invite for a job test in an Oil & Gas company (everyone’s dream job innit? )  in those early days because I didn’t check my spam folder.
4984 2018-02-27 13:51:19 Because oil, gas, repair are consumer industries with transparent prices and competition. They are relatively affordable for the consumer. None of us can afford the self-pay rates for even a primary care visit on a normal budget. Health should take notes from auto IMO
4985 2018-02-27 13:51:01 For shiny and healthy hair, mash an avocado, and a tablespoon of olive oil, and rub it through your hair. Wash your hair after 15 minutes
4986 2018-02-27 13:50:57 By taxing oil and gas, where do you think the raise would be going for most? To pay for these taxes, aka down the drain.
4987 2018-02-27 13:50:47 I'm saying it wasn't them alone that got captain Cheeto into office. Trump had been eyeing a move to politics for years and the voters were ready for a snake oil salesmen to make all their dreams come true.

5021 2018-02-27 13:47:02 It is terribly out of fashion to mention this in our end-of-history epoch of endless, cheap oil BUT:

Peak oil is not a theory; it is a scientific observation. A finite resource becomes more expensive as more is consumed & new supply requires more expensive technology to extract.
5022 2018-02-27 13:46:53 I still have you beat.

5086 2018-02-27 13:39:12 I can’t believe I have to put on my own lotion and oil. Blows my mind every day.

5088 2018-02-27 13:38:47 I think the Hada Labo punya is famous for non mineral oil. The blue bottle I think the cleansing oil ada mineral oil. Yg brand lain xpasti  tapi Yg non mineral oil slalunya mahal...

5090 2018-02-27 13:38:19 We get so little rain (under 2" I think for this rainy season) that the motor oil on the roads make for an extra slippery ride. Easy to forget to allow for that!

5099 2018-02-27 13:36:29 I'd like Tzeporah to explain why of all the oil/gas producing jurisdictions in the world, Alberta has to be the first and only one to fall on its sword? Why doesn't she ask that of countries with lax environmental regs? There are far more of those than there are Albertas.
5100 2018-02-27 13:36:18 Norwegian state oil fund, the largest public fund of the world, did well in 2017. Up 19% profit to a value of almost 880 billion euro. It has interest in 9000 companies worldwide and manages Norway's gas and oil income. It serves as saving pot for Norway's future.
5101 2018-02-27 13:36:13 For some, it would be.  The glossy covers are the best for Goo Gone because they can just be wiped off.  If the covers are matte, the Goo Gone oil will most likely seep into the cover and stain.

5118 2018-02-27 13:34:21 endorse. this is how I cook steaks too. relevant addenda:

- cast iron pan is ideal for this technique, use it if you have one
- high heat requires high smoke point oil. neutral vegetable, canola, or peanut oil is a good choice
- get the steak up to room temp before cooking

Just...ugh. 
5167 2018-02-27 13:26:33 Remain, bullish crude oil prices. Further drop of inventories could continue ( demand increase as US economy gets stronger and new businesses open), going into summer driving season & travel, and success of OPEC keep prices higher.

5180 2018-02-27 13:25:09 No it is not about persuade to spend. It is about what the seismic shows regarding prospectivity and if there is oil bearing reservoir under your block. If Texaco had seen nothing in their seismic, they would not have spent nada on OPL 216.

5232 2018-02-27 13:18:08 Crude oil prices were boosted by weaker dollar, stronger Chinese demand for crude after China Jan crude oil imports jumped +21% m/m to a record 9.61 million bpd, & increase in the crack spread to 3-1/4 mo high, which gives refiners incentive to purchase crude - refine to gasoline

5306 2018-02-27 13:07:35 You had better as you will lose all OUR oil money, and then you will sweat.
5307 2018-02-27 13:07:29 They have some kind of oil inside. You break them into 1/4 then pour hot water such that it mixes in the water then you drink. 

Only drink it once a day at night before bed. Not more than a quarter of a nut per day.

5310 2018-02-27 13:07:04 @Putin, you are trading the lives of innocent God Loving women & Children for the promise of Oil from Iran & Palestine...please STOP
5311 2018-02-27 13:07:03 In other words most of US production cannot meet the specifications for WTI(37-42 API). The US is therefore a condensate producer, which competes with Qatar and Iran and not in the worldwide crude oil market.

5320 2018-02-27 13:05:36 Yes, kind-of, but only utility-scale solar (photovoltaic) and with storage capability. Capital costs for solar are still substantially higher than most conventional energy (especially natural gas). Interesting view on the overcapacity of solar->boost to oil exports.

5413 2018-02-27 12:52:04 Historically, there has been a reasonably good correlation between speculative positions and the oil price. Debate is whether speculators cause price rises or follow them. Personally, I believe the latter - speculators don't take delivery so can't cause shortages (in theory)

5420 2018-02-27 12:51:17 There's a big problem with the narrative your ilk spun and that is there is no proof of it except for the fact that we were in Iraq, and any money made off Iraq's oil went to Iraq not the United States.

5424 2018-02-27 12:51:03 Part 2: of the Clinton Foundation money that was stolen from the Haitians. 976 million stolen so far that we know about. Plus the Clinton's control all Haiti's resources. Haiti has oil, gold and many natural resources but they can't sell a thing without the Clinton's handling it.
5425 2018-02-27 12:50:53 Instead of the majority being forced to send our children to Christian pvt schools or home school, let the trans libtards have pvt schools. I am tired of the squeaky wheels getting all the oil. As soon as we get the liberal unions out of the schools the better.

5528 2018-02-27 12:39:33 Famfa was simply lucky to have got that particular block OPL 216. It was a prospective block with huge oil reservoir in it & they got Texaco to maximise it. Noreast got OPL 215 same time as Agbami & got Mobil & Total involved but no discovery, because …not prospective.
5529 2018-02-27 12:39:23 And a sprinkle of some anointing oil. Never forget that one

5533 2018-02-27 12:38:56 Fracking is already happening in the UK. It is a fairly well kept secret. Do we buy Norwegian oil now? Or is it too expensive? Climate change legislation his the poorest hardest. They cannot afford to pay the unreasonable bills. All that money goes to pay nonsense industries
5534 2018-02-27 12:38:19 Texaco itself was not flying blind in Agbami. In fact Texaco entered 3 deepwater partnerships in 1995 with Famfa, Statoil & Mobil. Statoil’s OPL 217 was adjacent to Famfa’s OPL 216. Statoil also discovered oil in Ekoli which was an extension of the Agbami field.

5800 2018-02-27 12:02:14 seems nicely correlated with oil price

5803 2018-02-27 12:01:57 Rajiv I so thoroughly enjoyed facilitating the session ..so many quotable quotes learning is new oil or new soil..why do you want to measure social learning..duration and experience begins and ends with data..you were and are superb!
5804 2018-02-27 12:01:53 Russian Federal Antimonopoly Agency (FAS) approved British oil giant BP's bid to buy a 49% stake in governmentally-owned Rosneft's subsidiary Kharampurneftegaz
5805 2018-02-27 12:01:46 Another friend overseas was trying to convince his international oil & gas company to invest in Pakistan & they started to work on it. Unfortunately we had IK & TUQ Dharna & they dropped the idea: saying it is too unstable country. Our establishment is damaging us in this way too

5807 2018-02-27 12:01:23 This area is being restored to native forest (orangutan habitat) - the ‘trees’ being cut are actually non-native oil Palms, responsible for large scale deforestation in the area
5808 2018-02-27 12:01:19 #Oil edged lower ahead of weekly data that is forecast to show a rise in #US #crude inventories, although investor faith in #OPEC's ability to curtail production helped stem a larger price slide.

5810 2018-02-27 12:01:16 I figured out, if you put coconut oil in the pan. Before you cook kale. It makes it a lot easier to scrape it in the trash when it's done.

5820 2018-02-27 12:00:30 court made it clear: Trump is not above the law—Interior Secretary Zinke cannot yank away common sense rule that was product of years of careful deliberation simply to appease friends in the oil & gas industry.

5844 2018-02-27 11:57:07 Big OIL will make sure this never takes off the ground. .. just saying
5845 2018-02-27 11:56:58 Remember when oil was over $120 a barrel and certain politicians told us “We can’t drill our way out of this problem”? Well, we did it.
5846 2018-02-27 11:56:21 RT @KhayAmoore: I will sell the oil for your hair that I make for $10 a bottle for now. The bottles that I use cost $4 so I would be starting small and working my way up or using cheaper bottles. #natural #naturalhair #hair #haircare #ALLNATURAL

5854 2018-02-27 11:54:03 Very good that your palm oil is sustainable btw!
Should be mandatory/added-value to get your palm oil from such a source so more plantations become sustainable. 

But again: does not exclude possibility to further deforestation if demand increases.
5855 2018-02-27 11:53:58 And I had washed my hands, too! I now understand that rubbing fingertips with oil prior to handling the Pepper helps avoid the problem in the first place.

5859 2018-02-27 11:53:21 I am going to start throwing Bicyle magazines and Truffle oil down the waste disposal if this gets any worse.
5860 2018-02-27 11:53:10 That's right just like North Sea oil revenue which was squandered by Thatcher on tax cuts unlike the oil revenue in Norway which was invested.
5861 2018-02-27 11:53:08 OMG. I could just imagine the whole trip na amoy efficacent oil HAHAHA  sa uv pa talaga

5863 2018-02-27 11:52:35 US stock futures are down 0.25% with Asia mixed and Europe lower. Oil is $63.68 with gold at $1,334. A day that needs a little help. We will see.

5868 2018-02-27 11:51:47 The way the oil is out on the lane is basically the equivalent of going from your local par 3 corse to playing Augusta. Best way I can explain it.
5869 2018-02-27 11:51:39 Imagine what it must be like to have so much self loathing you die in gunfire trying to help an Oil & Gas company get more oil & gas.
5870 2018-02-27 11:51:38 Sorry but demand for palm oil is worldwide.

So if demand increases by X, an area able to produce X will be found somewhere: deforestation.

Unless you have global agreements to exclude this possibility (in effect forcing current users of palm oil to look for other products).
5871 2018-02-27 11:51:23 オリーブ油は、毎朝やっているテレビ番組のコーナーでも使っていたりするよね♪
5872 2018-02-27 11:51:10 Well I’m a guy and my hair isn’t thick but it won’t lay for shit, I usually have to blow it out first, then use a mixture of argan and almond oil along with some gel and beeswax (the gel and beeswax set it and keep it flat, but the oil prevents it from flaking)
5873 2018-02-27 11:51:08 We talked about the palm oil industry in class today. Definitely had my fair share of the discussion thanks to @OliverBurdett
5874 2018-02-27 11:51:03 Because union donations don't pay as well as big corporations and money is the oil that keeps the Washington machine running. And If Washington is a swamp then money is also the swamp water, never trust anyone drenched in the stuff.
5875 2018-02-27 11:50:46 It’s a 2nd rounder that becomes a first rounder if he re-signs this off-season.  From accounts, Sharks are viewing as a pure rental without current plans to re-sign.
5876 2018-02-27 11:50:26 I and many more hope for it. However, oil companies like all successful industries have learned that market share based solely on price evaporate as soon as the price competitor stops leading with price.

5892 2018-02-27 11:47:54 So look y’all. I bought some Vitamin E oil because my skin was dry af. Around my eyes and just dry. Vitamin E oil is great for moisture. I have oily skin normally so I’m thinking wtf this shit just gonna clog my pores. Why did it fade all of my dark marks. BIHHHHH  Go get some!
5893 2018-02-27 11:47:50 I used the coconut oil for a while. Only thing is, you cant spit it down the drain. A waterpik is great cuz it also stimulates gums & can go down drain. Maybe a combo would be good.

5928 2018-02-27 11:40:04 The difference between #UK and Norway is that their import is small but their oil export is huge. #EU could therefore dictate to them.
5929 2018-02-27 11:39:59 Green policy is farcical and ineffective as long as it panders to the main drivers of pollution like oil producers, airlines, car makers etc.
We're about to embark on the 2nd UK scrappage, replacing cars that replaced so say polluting cars. Global Over-capacity's the real reason.

5938 2018-02-27 11:38:53 Not sure how it works regarding sanctions to be honest, I think this would be selective for certain cargos (oil, gas, coal, industrial) - as you say though the difference is interpretive.

5952 2018-02-27 11:35:17 ... for example look Crude Oil in 2007. The Large traders went to a record net long position in early 2007 at $60-70 before it went up $140. Not bad and certainly not dumb. Sometimes the large traders win and sometimes the commercials win.
5953 2018-02-27 11:35:13 Really ? Mossadegh tried to stop the British from controlling Iran's oil. The British got the Americans involved. And the Shah Pahlavi colluded. He colluded with foreign powers to bring down Iran's legitimate Prime Minister. And you're expressing support for someone like that ?
5954 2018-02-27 11:35:04 Can someone explain the wisdom of provoking someone who could potentially destabilise the Palm Oil industry, hotels, shipping lines?

6102 2018-02-27 11:04:04 I have to question your "expertise". In that short interview on #alloutpolitics, you have failed to mention the growth of the RU economy since 1999 (oil p not the only reason) and then when clueless @adamboultonSKY compared Vlad to Stalin, you said: "Exactly". Hilarious!

6111 2018-02-27 11:03:13 Agreed, Japan oil consumption declining, and Europe and US will start to soon as well. Rest of Asia market will become more vital for crude producers going forward
6112 2018-02-27 11:02:53 I had a dream that I was hiding from the authorities in a special system of tunnels under my city and in abandoned areas. I also somehow sunk 3 oil tankers, found a bunch of friends, and I had three new 5 * servants in the FGO. Now I will take the medicine and continue to sleep
6113 2018-02-27 11:02:43 Really? Do you mean that 3 or 4 players? And I talked about that WSW are not very good club and you suddenly started talking about Western pride. Fact is: oil leagues are better than WSW .

6374 2018-02-27 10:13:15 The ignorance of @MBuhari and his hailers is that, they don't know that all partners will remove their money from Oil sales and expenses before talking about Nigeria earnings.

6422 2018-02-27 10:02:45 Yes. It is great to be out of recession even if marginally. Economic growth rate is still below the rate of population growth, so it is  still not UHuRu. Hopefully, politics will not be too much of a distraction this year and oil stays up

7245 2018-02-27 07:23:53 I agree there was heroism practiced in bringing the whaling industry to light. There is also the reality that replacing of whale oil for kerosene drastically reduced our own need for whale oil.
7246 2018-02-27 07:23:50 @DrRobJones How about evaluating black seed oil, for hair health and rejuvenation?  We can send eval units!

7261 2018-02-27 07:22:26 Tea tree oil makes a great spot treatment. Try pure tea tree oil diluted with coconut oil, or look out for facial products made with it.
7262 2018-02-27 07:22:06 #Oil prices on Tuesday erased earlier gains as rising U.S. supply outweigh signs of demand gains. U.S. WTI crude for April delivery was down 15 cents, or 0.2 percent, at $63.76 a barrel. Brent crude in London was down 10 cents at $67.40 a barrel.

7278 2018-02-27 07:20:23 You don’t even know what the level of success or outcome of the drilling operations will be, but you’re already thinking about profits. Drilling for oil and gas is major capital expenditure with no guaranteed outcome.
7279 2018-02-27 07:20:19 Still an interesting point to know how many whales it would have taken to satisfy oil demand in the 1970's before you put a final end to most whaling.

7631 2018-02-27 06:22:23 I recently was “attacked” by a very large, heavy   olive oil bottle and broke the toes on my right foot. Most of my friends laughed and said, “that! could only happen to you!”  What’s missing on Twitter is that ability to laugh about ourselves.

7795 2018-02-27 05:53:01 Of course it came down, nature of the beast. They all came down. Look at what Buffalo got for Kane & Nucks literally got nothing for Vanek. Without question it came down.

7861 2018-02-27 05:39:09 Because it's in the middle east which contains most of the last scraps of oil in the planet. America is even denying real climate change bc it doesn't conform with our capitalist idea of infinite growth powered by energy/ fossil fuel. America values the economy over lives any day
7862 2018-02-27 05:39:03 is in loan security which makes it less risky for private investors to invest in the project.  So we put Albertans to work, attract private investment, and with the upgraded crude we can ship more of our oil using existing pipelines.  Seems like a pretty smart plan to me.

8124 2018-02-27 04:57:12 I seem to recall that this was warned 20 years ago. The people who warned it predicted it would happen when in the next 20 to 30 years. Those types who like Jizmodo claimed the people warning this were just war mongers out to steal all the oil from the Middle East.
8125 2018-02-27 04:56:55 I see all these posts with “olive oil” and all this other nonsense but nothing. I repeat, NOTHING compares to some good bread and butter. A classic.
8126 2018-02-27 04:56:54 Don't forget Carter Page who is essentially a compromised spy. He's had pro Russia leanings and relations with other spies. This syndicate is massive and all about oil and gas and Russia trying to reassert themselves as a super power.

8175 2018-02-27 04:49:32 It can be really hard on your hair. As black women we typically need more oils in our hair and shampoos tend to get rid of any oil you put in or that your scalp naturally creates. Cowashes clean your hair and scalp a lot more gently and make your hair  a lot less dry and brittle

8203 2018-02-27 04:46:36 Never understood why those who live in the middle of nowhere are so scared of losing a job they don't want cuz not coal or oil and farming doesnt pay cuz sold the farm to big ag and now poor
8204 2018-02-27 04:46:35 Taking care of our beautiful earth has to be a priority. Oil is the wrong direction for our future!

8207 2018-02-27 04:45:23 Which oil company (not Exxon/Mobil) will profit the most when Tillerson fails to deliver relief of sanctions?
8208 2018-02-27 04:45:23 don’t get me wrong I can get behind all those more exciting flavors too but I think these guys are the ideal permutation of loads of starch, oil and salt
8209 2018-02-27 04:45:08 GOOD FATS: Avocado, Fish, Almonds, Walnuts, Peanuts, Cashews, Olive Oil, Coconut Oil, Seeds, Coconut, Olives, Peanut Butter, Low-Fat Dairy

8213 2018-02-27 04:45:00 I was on zopiclone for 7 years for my hardcore insomnia and my doctor took me off and put me on THC oil. I have never slept so well or felt better. All natural and works like a damn.
8214 2018-02-27 04:44:37 not if you don't ingest oil for 7 hours
8215 2018-02-27 04:44:35 My local autoparts store has a google cardboard installed in the motor oil section. The future is now?
8216 2018-02-27 04:44:29 Do oil companies get subsidies in the US?
8217 2018-02-27 04:44:09 @YouTube why do i get two three adds for hairfall oil and hotel, i just once watched 1 video for hair fall and looked a room once, its so irritating, r is your logic not working right
8218 2018-02-27 04:43:55 You two should oil up and naked wrestle. I’ll watch
8219 2018-02-27 04:43:52 um so a jar of oil-packed sun dried tomatoes leaked oil onto the power strip in my kitchen, this is definitely not chill right? i unplugged everything... oil + electricity = bad,?
8220 2018-02-27 04:43:46 Dang that's particularly intense, I do sleep with a plug-in wall unit that burns citronella oil tho.
8221 2018-02-27 04:43:44 So regardless of canadas oil production a heavy amount of oil imports will always be required for dilution. But forget about any new refineries the business case does not stand up with all the business taxes and labour rates. It is what it is

8225 2018-02-27 04:43:04 Which oil did you use?
8226 2018-02-27 04:42:59 No.    Just Godfather, Goodfellas, and Three Stooges.   These are like cod liver oil for most women.    The others all have cross-over appeal.

8230 2018-02-27 04:42:08 That's why our fake Congress wanted to sanction Russia's oil companies and stop a pipeline. Claimed it was about "meddling"
8231 2018-02-27 04:42:04 @RachelNotley and her @albertaNDP caucus will ensure the economy is diversified by continuing their work at destroying the oil industry and ensuring no pipelines get built, soon to be craft breweries and pot shops, she wants us drunk & stoned so we won't know we're poor

8264 2018-02-27 04:36:54 Man I gotta fix this oil leak this weekend so I can go to the gs open and not look like a fool when I go to leave 
8265 2018-02-27 04:36:37 I don't get why oil companies are still doing their thing. It's obvious that it's fucking up the planet. Why not invest in clean energy? You can still be your scummy greedy selves and keep the world alive at the same time.
8266 2018-02-27 04:36:24 Its an oil, that comes in a tall bottle, it looks orange but its just the oil inside, you can get it at wal-mart, I use that with my mixed chick deep conditioner, smells great!

8274 2018-02-27 04:34:53 That’s really good stuff. You should check out Minus 8 vinegar next!  Hands down my favorite vinegar ever. You only need a few drops mixed with the Colavita olive oil to make a ridiculous vinaigrette.
8275 2018-02-27 04:34:36 The robo-misogyny here really makes my blood oil.
8276 2018-02-27 04:34:29 I think step one, from what I understand, is opening military bases and permanently staffing them. The benefit is war profiteering ad infinitum, along with the need for tons of oil and gas.  I don’t know beyond that, unless it has to do with Russia gaining power in the region

8278 2018-02-27 04:34:24 Very proud of Trudeau! Canada is thriving again after the mess Harper put us in putting all the chips on oil.

8525 2018-02-27 03:59:06 Don't expect anything better from Trump the snake oil salesman & actor. The NRA has most likely been funding his business over the years as American banks don't. Boycott his family business and anything with the Trump name on it.

8534 2018-02-27 03:57:42 Alex, at least you've been consistent, even though I don't always agree with you.  @glennbeck, however, even though I think you can be a snake oil salesman as well, Glenn, well, he is pure snake oil and only out for notoriety and money, period.  In my book, also known as 'Scum.'
8535 2018-02-27 03:57:27 just having a little glass jar with some garlic in your olive oil is great to have around in general

8556 2018-02-27 03:54:34 This has other consequences.
What if these nuclear devices are positioned close to oil fields, goes off & contaminates their oil fields
What would the world look like in regards to oil prices, usage & where it would come from?
Russia does have unclaimed HUGE Oil Fields near Artic

8605 2018-02-27 03:45:21 He'd never do that. Why that would be almost as silly and destructive as having a career poluter who sued the EPA numerous times as your head of EPA, or a Secretary of State who has oil dealings in Russia, or a Secretary of Education who doesn't believe in public schools.

Oh.

8608 2018-02-27 03:45:09 Why do we want an oil and gas guy? Shouldn’t we all be backing the solar panel green person if there is one such person.
8609 2018-02-27 03:45:08 Ideals our politicians follow are petty parody of greed for money & power. Nothing much, nothing less. Evident they are feeding on ignorance of uneducated & poor. Snake oil sellers don't last, but we've got lots. Nepal needs #education to rid of this pests & #soonWewill together
8610 2018-02-27 03:44:58 Not really Greg. As an indigenous people, their land is just been exploited indiscriminately, their drinking water poisoned as oil and gas pipelines leak. Nothing is sacred anymore, but greed and trying to push out LNG at the cost of disrupting their natural livelihood.

8612 2018-02-27 03:44:56 Look, I have no problem with the crooked hat. With that said, any job I’ve ever had required much less talent and SIGNIFICANTLY less compensation, and they required a code of apparel. At the end of the day the squeaky wheel gets the oil, and #braves are just appeasing the whiners
8613 2018-02-27 03:44:51 Isnt it great being right next door to the super power in oil , Alberta who will give Canadians much cheaper domestic supply - wait a minute ! its going thru BC to China - what no refinery in AB ? a 7 fold tanker increase on coast to transport oil ?

8627 2018-02-27 03:43:38 Dude... people die. Did you not pay attention in school? We should not be FORCED to purchase insurance that we can't afford. The health insurance industry puts more money in the pockets of politicians than the oil/gas industry. None of them care about us. #wakeup

8665 2018-02-27 03:38:23 @CarplukAPUSH Rockefeller monopolized the entire oil refinery industry, completely destroying many small businesses while putting his on the top. In the process, he would become the first billionare while also donating to various educational, religious, and scientific causes.

8667 2018-02-27 03:38:19 Not even an hydraulic fracturing at 1312 ft (400 m) , developed in horizontal plane , could intercept a fresh water reservoir  at 984 ft. (300 m)  .  Furthermore, should not be a good investment produce fresh water in an oil/gas well.  No-nonsense.

8673 2018-02-27 03:37:18 My theory is that human attention is the new oil. Brands and platforms crave for it, to fuel action from people. While digging for it, we hit a lot of false notes and get other things besides oil, but when we do hit the right place, action happens.

8691 2018-02-27 03:35:13 I don't blame you for the clothespin idea.
You can do what my grandmother did to me as a child and dab the Vicks/essential oil on your upper lip, that way, it'll be the only thing you smell. Better alternative is the back of your hand, maybe.

This is right up there in reporting oil spills in smaller units so the final number's huge.

8742 2018-02-27 03:30:08 So what really constitutes the new oil, is anybody's guess. It's certainly neither data nor attention (as you inferred). Rather it's a fine blend of multifaceted factors.

Take motor apart again put the gsr head on, change tranny n clutch, relocate the battery to trunk, run a catch can oil feeds, clean more the bay, buy hood, front bumper maybe fenders and send to bodyshop.... smhhhh
8792 2018-02-27 03:23:54 I’m really considering painting as a past time. Oil painting specifically.
8793 2018-02-27 03:23:46 I assume/hope the "next recommended service" sticker on my car is referring to an oil change, if it means anything more I'm gonna have to make another appointment
8794 2018-02-27 03:23:38 There’s a lot of ways to make money in the oil and gas business, and not all of them involve drilling for oil...You just drill investors’ pocketbooks. When investors are willing to throw money at you, you can just make money on that. It’s a time-honored tradition.”
8795 2018-02-27 03:23:04 Can we get a follow from you also Susan @Oil_Ranger ? Your list has great folks!
8796 2018-02-27 03:22:37 You'll be missed in Oil Country Big Rig! You're definitely a fan favourite here so I hope you meant what you said today about wanting to come back here on July 1st cuz this Oiler fan is counting the days until you do! Good luck the rest of the season! See you on July 1st! 
8797 2018-02-27 03:22:36 i finally got oil paints a few weeks ago but i cant find my natural hair brush to try them out...... rip
8798 2018-02-27 03:22:33 I can see that if you're talking about microwaveable popcorn. I get some Orville Reddenbacher popcorn kernels and coconut oil. I blast away on the stove top. I only microwave the butter to put on my popcorn

8800 2018-02-27 03:22:08 U.S. oil extends gains to hold near three-week high: TOKYO (Reuters) - Oil prices extended gains on Tuesday, supported by signs of stronger demand, robust production curbs led by OPEC and a slight fall in U.S. output.

8804 2018-02-27 03:21:52 To soften your hands, rub your hands with warm olive oil, leave it on for 5-7 minutes, and rinse off with warm water.
8805 2018-02-27 03:21:50 And you need to have compulsory 70gms - 100gms of fat (unsalted butter,organic coconut oil or ghee) daily for first 10 days and after that 30gms - 50gms... If you feel hungry in between,you can eat pista,Sunflower,watermelon &pumpkin seeds...!!!
8806 2018-02-27 03:21:32 .@GeneralThoughts is right; the Saudis are preparing for a post-oil future.  If ExxonMobile and others had the same foresight a decade ago, they wouldn’t have to keep propping up oil for their own survival.

8814 2018-02-27 03:20:24 .@realDonaldTrump Donnie, really you would run into a building with gun shots coming from it. That is amazing because you dodged the draft 5 times. You are a sad piece of human garbage. You are a pathological liar, a snake oil salesman. Reality is you are a coward never a hero.
8815 2018-02-27 03:20:21 -Use essential oils like eucalyptus, and peppermint to stimulate your hair follicle ( make sure to only mix 2-3 drops with about 1/4 of coconut, olive, vitamin E, or even vegetable oil because pure essential oils can burn if not diluted
8816 2018-02-27 03:20:16 久々に会議でバチバチしてストレスフルになったので出張に行きます。探さないでください（違う）
8817 2018-02-27 03:20:12 -Don't touch it when it's dry
-Use thick oils to seal in moisture ( caster oil is my fav)
-DONT USE SHAMPOO ( cowashes and even just conditioner are enough)
8818 2018-02-27 03:19:57 yeah that's gonna burn but also...kinda great. lol. also i would maybe try argan oil or a weekly mask with biotin or coconut oil in it.
8819 2018-02-27 03:19:42 I haven’t had yam in the longest. I want yam and oil :(

8822 2018-02-27 03:19:34 Because, in our earth, lies the answers to our illnesses, to our hope for a future worth living. It's all connected. We can't run oil pipes under our rivers haphazardly for the sake of cash. We can't mine for gold and copper that will run out in a few years, laying waste land.
8823 2018-02-27 03:19:32 Sounds silly, but Arnica oil, best damn thing for swelling and bruising too. Hope you’re icing too. It’s all up hill from here!

8826 2018-02-27 03:19:03 My dear make you some yam! You can’t have twins after the first try - and most Nigerian recipes are just fried/boiled yam with oil unless you’re making porridge yam. Either way yam is tasty! Twins not included.

8989 2018-02-27 02:53:30 Oil and gas are not children. They are natural resources under the control of major corporate giants, making untold amounts of wealth and equally-boggling amounts of pollution.

The Trump family’s greed is small potatoes next to the oil barons.

9001 2018-02-27 02:51:32 Good Article...Bug they left out a "grey" area. Decade or so ago, Israel gave GH back to Syria in a peace agreement. Syria broke the treaty and shelled Israel, so they took back the GH, never to give it back again. Syria fucked up. As far as I'm concerned, it' Israeli oil.
9002 2018-02-27 02:51:27 Syrian government doesn't bomb it's own people. This is propaganda to get U.S and allies to overthrow Syria and steal it's oil.

9052 2018-02-27 02:44:06 4. You're right, it is a monosaturated fat, but eating those in high levels, which people do with coconut oil bc they believe it's the better alternative, can raise levels of LDL cholesterol which increases the risk for cardiovascular disease.
9053 2018-02-27 02:44:05 So do we continue to make empty threats, " this time we mean it, stop or else" and watch as thousands of innocent people, mostly children are slaughtered by chemical weapons? Or should we do something about it? Oh, no oil fields, nevermind.

9064 2018-02-27 02:42:58 These are the kinds of things that happen  (intended or not) when promises are made and then acted in without stakeholders input. Strangling oil, gas and resources then cuts a source of financial wiggle room.

9086 2018-02-27 02:40:17 Roast fave veg (carrots peppers, eggplant, garlic, onion for me) with a little olive oil, s&p. Whiz  into puree. Season. Chill. No recipe. Fun experiment. Can buy good jarred at Galloway's too.
9087 2018-02-27 02:40:17 Decided to try a healthy olive oil topping recipe for my pasta instead of just using pasta sauce and 0/10 would recommend

9090 2018-02-27 02:39:49 What made my transition easier, is protective styles (Box Braids) every 2 months i believe! I gradually cut when i took the braids out. I also oiled my scalp a lot with coconut oil. I learned how to wrap scarfs , but i left my satin bonnet under!

9096 2018-02-27 02:39:09 I honestly feel like you’re still giving them too much credit, they don’t even take care of their “tribe”. Their only purpose is to enrich themselves and their donors. They sell out on every issue; NRA>students, Oil/Auto> Climate, Church> LGBTQ/Reproductive Rights, etc, etc.

theres a lot of benefit in using coconut oil

9100 2018-02-27 02:38:58 When it was a pretty shit day this night is turning out pretty good. Now I can sit here in my bed, chill out and glisten from the gobs of coconut oil slathered all over my body. 
9101 2018-02-27 02:38:52 it's 8:35pm which means it's time for me to turn on my essential oil diffuser and watch hulu in my bed

lightly but firmly rubbing coconut oil into your cuticles every now and then would be beneficial

9131 2018-02-27 02:32:25 My prediction for the conclusion of Mueller’s investigation: we find out that Russia put Trump in the White House because he agreed to appoint Rex Tillerson.

9145 2018-02-27 02:31:00 It is cool that you have that interest to learn about motors. Most people just run to the shop just to change oil.
9146 2018-02-27 02:30:52 I paid for my oil change just as the auto shop was closing. The tech said he was glad I paid with a card because he had already closed the register. A woman then walked in behind me and dropped $1,300 cash on the counter.

9218 2018-02-27 02:20:14 So now you're a psychic, predicting that conclusion? And yes, it always comes back to the money raised. I wonder, how many of Beto's individual donors are also tied to industries, such as, oil, gas, cattle, finance, chemicals, prisons, weapons and other war-related industries?
9219 2018-02-27 02:19:58 Yes, but Try vitamin D oil. Mainly for your face 
9220 2018-02-27 02:19:50 Keto friends!! I have a recipe calling for MCT oil but I don’t have any  Can I use my olive oil instead?
9221 2018-02-27 02:19:49 You really need some professional help. I see a daughter's love for her father. You are a jealous and bitter poor excuse of a human being. Go get your oil changed, maybe it will lighten your bitchy mood.
9222 2018-02-27 02:19:45 Is that cover girl lip oil in stores yet?
9223 2018-02-27 02:19:40 Get well soon! My hub had stents 12/16. He went plant based no oil and is doing great. All blood work looks good, in fact he just heard so today again. It’s a personal decision, not preaching just adding my 2 cents. Much love.

9238 2018-02-27 02:17:28 Is Manchester City “authentic soccer”? They are using Emirates oil $ to pillage other clubs. How about PSG as a de facto arm of Qatar govt.? Are the LA Dodgers an “authentic” baseball team. They started in Brooklyn. This is a stupid take but par for the course for you.
9239 2018-02-27 02:17:26 It won’t sink in. Like oil on water.
9240 2018-02-27 02:17:07 i like to think of CBD oil as the lubricant that helps my body function but because it would cost $80+/month for me to take the optimal amount, i have to space out how much i'm lubin up.... which means i'm still moving but i often feel relatively useless ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

9268 2018-02-27 02:13:37 Oh man. Oil? Just drill your wells like 7° pitch from the surface. Might take a few more miles of pipe, but they could theoretically set a refinery in Jericho and bleed all that oil out.

9290 2018-02-27 02:10:41 Do any of the participants of #DontDrillNC understand the states' need for oil?

Where, if not NC is it safer to drill for oil? Someone else's backyard?

Instead of banning drilling, why not insist on the 'Nations Safest and Strictest' regulations.

Set The Bar, Don't Remove It
9291 2018-02-27 02:10:41 It's not a new use of government power.  Governments make decisions every day in favor of or against companies based strictly on politics. (Example: Obama administration blocking pipe line and oil drilling because they didn't like the use of fossil fuels).

9360 2018-02-27 02:00:42 Amusing to hear former journo @jasjohalbc smear #StopKM folks as "radical," "lurking," "enemies of B.C."

1. Three in five British Columbians oppose more oil tankers on the coast.

2. I learned about encrypted messaging from journalists. Guessing politicians use it too.

9362 2018-02-27 02:00:15 We own one. :) It's a classic worst-of-both-worlds compromise. Oil changes and reduced cargo room! Though it serves us reasonably well as a 1-car house for now.

9372 2018-02-27 01:58:42 Ok. So you agree the Feds shouldn't be giving corporate subsidies to Big Oil, Big Agra and Big Pharma?
9373 2018-02-27 01:58:41 Got an essential oil diffuser and I have no regrets.
9374 2018-02-27 01:58:38 Be careful. Rub some cannabis oil on them.
9375 2018-02-27 01:58:30 I.e. Oil and gas firms have income, but federal income taxes don't violate 92a because they apply broadly. If there were a special income tax on oil extraction, that would likely be another kettle of fish.

9379 2018-02-27 01:57:18 Great day in Oil Country.
9380 2018-02-27 01:57:17 It could perhaps preclude a structure like Norway has, with oil specific carbon taxes but I don't think it has any power against what is considered by Trudeau.
9381 2018-02-27 01:57:13 Attention: BC Ferrys is currently offering up to 10% off on purchase price of vehicle fares if you bring in your used diesel fuel or cooking oil. (Min. 25litres. NOT valid with other offers.) That is all. Thank You
9382 2018-02-27 01:56:53 Haha I mean, I used marble jack cheese, all natural olive oil mayo, and whole wheat bread...I haven't descended into poverty cheese levels
9383 2018-02-27 01:56:30 my teammate just tried to hide under the oil tank. i totally to that
9384 2018-02-27 01:56:26 there used to be an italian restaurant near me that had an appetizer that was a head of broccoli (chopped into florets) sauteed with olive oil, dried red peppers, garlic, then topped w/parmesan cheese. sometimes i'd just get that. it was fantastic. love the green veggies.

9395 2018-02-27 01:55:15 In future, I'll suggest cooking them on the bbq in tin foil with olive oil, seasoning salt and garlic. They cook up amazing and in a relatively short time.
9396 2018-02-27 01:54:57 Koch bros built oil refineries for Iran Bush family did construction and oil deals with Saudi Arabia and Bin Laden family...
9397 2018-02-27 01:54:56 Do ppl realize they only fight for the oil we steal
9398 2018-02-27 01:54:40 I’m not a US citizen but I’m curious; why do you think obama was a liberal? He only spok like one! Every real decision he made benefited, oil companies, banks, Insurance companies, the military industrial complex and of course his major donor Monsanto chemical company!
9399 2018-02-27 01:54:36 Y’all. This guy just changed my oil for da freeeeee
9400 2018-02-27 01:54:36 I didn't have salt spray so I just put salt into my hair oil. It kinda worked lol
9401 2018-02-27 01:54:18 Heating assistance is top five for helping the poor. You'd think to feed the oil and gas monster in America they'd expand it so their donors could get even more corporate welfare.
9402 2018-02-27 01:54:18 What’s the best coconut oil for skin and hair!??
9403 2018-02-27 01:54:05 I do this on the regular. Also, measure liquid with dry measure (which I didn’t know was a thing) trying hard not to spill the oil/water/milk/whatever. Everything makes sense now..:

9407 2018-02-27 01:53:38 Old guys like you have spent your careers entangling the US is the politics of the Middle East, a region soon to become a backwater as the world transitions away from oil - at which point, nobody is going to care any more about US schemes in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen.
9408 2018-02-27 01:53:31 If they sue the oil companies, remove the threat, cut off the oil and gas.
9409 2018-02-27 01:53:07 Use coconut oil grease blue magic to be exact and use a lot ...the hair is probably irritating your scalp

9417 2018-02-27 01:51:30 He traded away a star, left the B’s in a salary cap mess and is now well on his way to wreck the Oil.  Even up trade, Chiarelli for Bergevin...
9418 2018-02-27 01:51:13 I love putting coconut oil on my body!
9419 2018-02-27 01:51:03 The dancing ladies were like pouring oil to the fire and that was from one of the games called lipsync battle if im not mistaken. And also the fact that neelofa approved the games to be played in a 'club' shows everything was planned well. She expected this.

9422 2018-02-27 01:50:44 Today I trimmed a large pork bone to marinate the meat for a recipe, and tossed the bone in the oven with salt and olive oil. I am now a goddess in the eyes of my elderly dog.  Before, I was okay...now, a deity.
9423 2018-02-27 01:50:35 Oil and gas is powerful enough, why should I care if they get sued?
9424 2018-02-27 01:50:30 My car was just stolen.

9425 2018-02-27 01:50:28 First ingredient sugar, second ingredient vegetable oil. I quit reading after that.
9426 2018-02-27 01:50:17 He promised to legalize pot, and said the "right" things. Our conservative PM of 10yrs, Stephen Harper had overstayed his welcome, and campaigned mostly on appealing to our oil rich Province, and banning the Hijab in govt photos. In this climate... was not successful.
9427 2018-02-27 01:50:13 Next time try fresh garlic and olive oil.  Cut small let sizzle in oil, do not burn, soak up a cotton ball in the oil.  Place in ear opening until crunchy.  Repeat as needed...use fresh garlic.  Works every time.
9428 2018-02-27 01:50:09 Slavery was enforced with militias, so has the oil industry.

9436 2018-02-27 01:49:01 At the height of Italian immigration to Australia it was claimed (I'm pretty sure it was true) that they were smuggling salami (illegal) concealed in secret compartments of cans of olive oil (legal). Shanklish would be confusing

9438 2018-02-27 01:48:53 @VoodooDoughnuts have Palm Oil and/or Sunflower oil - either in them, or cooked in them.
That sucks - as I'm allergic to both.
Might explain why I've had to eat Bemedryl after visiting there each time.

9440 2018-02-27 01:48:36 This weeks @Walmart grocery pickup was a little rough. Need to check items before I leave. Received a broken lid on my coconut oil. Called store and will be going back tomorrow. Still a solid 4  experience through all my pickups though.
9441 2018-02-27 01:48:31 Do you need your carpets cleaned? We know you do, since we just broke into your house and poured a gallon of motor oil in your living room. #UnlikelyTelemarketerPitches
9442 2018-02-27 01:48:30 Avocado oil for moisturing the skin. 

I highly reccomend.
9443 2018-02-27 01:48:22 either one can be disturbing.  imagine having to use olive oil on your bread for the rest of your. actually that sounds great! olive oil for everyone!
9444 2018-02-27 01:48:09 who's loss of confidence would be the trigger? Oil producers?

9450 2018-02-27 01:47:04 @GovAbbott a "tone of respect" is not what is coming from the WH which all of you-@DanPatrick @KenPaxtonTX @tedcruz seem fine with. You attack the city of #austin, Trump's immigration, @PPTXVotes, stance on guns-good for hispanics? I guess maybe if they are oil execs then yes.

9504 2018-02-27 01:37:57 Well Gano french fry grease took the oil based paint off my hands today...
9505 2018-02-27 01:37:55 When you have an endless supply of Middle Eastern oil money, you can run anything well.
9506 2018-02-27 01:37:44 Shirt off Vernier is only my semi-perfect form. Wait till I get some tattoos and a bottle of baby oil

9511 2018-02-27 01:37:27 Hcfnbxgjfdg oh god that's awful! I really hate the snake oil peddling in general, because it preys on the vulnerable.

But I'm flat out boggled by the ones who do a thing that is making them blatantly sicker and they invent some fiction for why this is a good thing

9515 2018-02-27 01:36:42 Wind&Solar? 100% 24/7 on-tap fully-staffed baseload (nuke,gas,coal,oil) backup needed for wind&solar. Kinda expensive.
9516 2018-02-27 01:36:31 I need a good oil for Kyla’s hair, her curls are super tight.
9517 2018-02-27 01:36:19 DID ANYONE ACTUALLY EVER THINK HE WAS GOING TO DO ANYTHING?!  Did anyone ever actually think he was ever a man of his word?!  HE NEVER HAS BEEN!  Donald Trump is not an “honorable man”... HE IS “THE SNAKE!”  ...and he makes, brands & sells his own oil!
9518 2018-02-27 01:36:03 Our White Russian Brothers!? Siberian /Alaskan Oil? Texas Oil? Louisiana Oil .... Follow the Oil stain
9519 2018-02-27 01:35:50 Don't forget about the myrrh oil as well.

9521 2018-02-27 01:35:47 To be fair they have to use fake butter not oil, and make them so fast they can’t get crispy
9522 2018-02-27 01:35:47 Need some teatree oil for my face
9523 2018-02-27 01:35:43 Hmm both canola and olive oil? Do you plan on using fresh herbs or dried? 
9524 2018-02-27 01:35:32 My love for sesame oil has gone unpublished for far too long... I love that shit! 
9525 2018-02-27 01:35:16 Hi Nick, electricity generation isn't our core business at the moment, but as an energy reseller (rather than an oil company) we're certainly open to selling electrons instead of hydrocarbons! ^DZ
9526 2018-02-27 01:35:15 Wasn’t it reported that there were 5 teams interested in Maroon?  What happened?
9527 2018-02-27 01:34:57 I mean its right there and has lots of oil jobs right? Makes sense ppl would flock to its relative prosperity and security.
9528 2018-02-27 01:34:49 So I’m sitting here with this hot oil treatment in my hair what y’all doing 
9529 2018-02-27 01:34:23 “I dont drink water” i guess that’s why your urine smells like motor oil and is orange.

9531 2018-02-27 01:34:19 Chalk and oil pastels because most of my students have never experienced using them due to the expense.  They see the brilliant and rich hues, learn how to blend and make their art come alive!

9535 2018-02-27 01:33:44 Did someone grease the ball up with some oil because we cannot get a grip to save our lives.
9536 2018-02-27 01:33:36 Maybe a few drops of peppermint oil in some coconut oil? The oil will seal in some moisture and the peppermint will cool the inflammation. I add some sugar to that for lip scrub.
9537 2018-02-27 01:33:23 I reported that several days ago on twitter. It is an encouraging data point but hardly a trend. Most was not ultra-light tight oil but rather, heavier oil from the Gulf of Mexico. We have not solved our ultra-light problem by exporting heavier oil that we need to blend w/ it.

9542 2018-02-27 01:32:59 Went to cook steak. Ended up splashing my face with stupidly hot oil. Would never get this if I was a veggie
9543 2018-02-27 01:32:56 Maybe if you paid your $15M in taxes then you wouldn’t have to tax oil and gas, you would be able to fix PEIA AND pay for the teacher’s pay increase, but I guess that’s none of my business. I guess when you’re rich it doesn’t matter.

9547 2018-02-27 01:32:26 I've been using coconut oil on my hair, face, and nails for a month now, and it still hasn't fixed my life.
9548 2018-02-27 01:32:25 Of course not but the Preds didn't give up the necessary pieces for a 23 yr old star. Solid trade both ways.
9549 2018-02-27 01:32:19 Just like he ran away from the draft for the Vietnam war. Mr Snake oil salesman will say anything to gain a vote.

9553 2018-02-27 01:31:32 northerners steadily  cashing out on this Boko haram madness. Insurgency is the new "oil bloc"
9554 2018-02-27 01:31:06 And then, when political winds turn, and the Saudi's loathe us (10-20 years, doesn't matter) we will have provided nuclear assistance. This, in a place, where surplus energy in the forms of oil and solar power, makes nuclear energy superfluous, except for military purposes.

9558 2018-02-27 01:30:38 What is cbd oil? I have really bad anxiety... So maybe it could help me too...
9559 2018-02-27 01:30:22 Who said that but if you are trying to imply much of it was due to his tinkering, you would be mistaken. Start with the kid wearing 97, move to 33 and onto 29 for the biggest reasons why. Plus a ton of good luck...something they've had little of this season.
9560 2018-02-27 01:30:21 何度もすいません。十夜くんと朔空を見間違えていたみたいでこちらの手違いで声をかけてしまい申し訳ありませんでした。先程きちんと確認させて頂きました。改めて輝のみでご譲渡を検討よろしくお願いいたします。
9561 2018-02-27 01:30:16 He’s just too much. I’m sick of seeing this kid’s face every where. He’s no moral authority of any kind. I watched the guy change the oil in my car, does that make me a mechanic? Nope. He witnessed (if he was anywhere around) a shooting. He’s not even a victim
9562 2018-02-27 01:30:12 Oh yes! I've talked to a pharmacist. I have tea tree shampoo, tea tree oil diluted to spray on her head before sending her to school, plus 2 OTC lice treatments on hand as a precaution! Thankfully I braid her hair daily bc the pharmacist said that helps big time!

9571 2018-02-27 01:29:35 He's a snake oil guy huh
9572 2018-02-27 01:29:22 It's called a practical relationship. We exercise some minimal control over Saudi with our alliance. Better than the oil wealth being under Chinese and Russian influence being used directly (but covertly) to harm american interests.
9573 2018-02-27 01:29:22 เห็นมีคนขายบัตรพร้อมสิทธิ์ แต่ไม่รู้ไว้ใจได้ไหม
9574 2018-02-27 01:29:15 For someone with such a strong moral compass, you seem to enjoy spreading the lies and mistruths which have been perpetuated by the oil industry.

9580 2018-02-27 01:28:10 Omg I would be too. I’m sure you may know this but I’ve heard tea tree oil works really well!
9581 2018-02-27 01:28:02 Hypocrite! You support Zinke and reducing the national parks to allow fossil fuel exploration.
Your partly leader is promoting COAL AND OIL while reducing renewables. 
Stop with the lies, already.
9582 2018-02-27 01:28:02 1. Fill two small bowls with Italian breadcrumbs and whisked eggs. 
2. Put fish in crumbs, then egg bath, then crumbs again. Coat liberally. 
3. Heat thin layer of grape seed oil on medium. When hot, cook each side for about 2-3 minutes.
9583 2018-02-27 01:28:01 Price of crude oil, the main raw material from which petrol is extracted, has fallen by 50% when compared to Cong period.

When Crude at $147, Petrol was sold at Rs.80.

In Modi period, crude price had come down to $ 50-65, Petrol is being sold at Rs.80. What is logic followed?

9593 2018-02-27 01:26:58 The goals haven't been there this season, just like almost everyone on Hawks roster,  but is a solid two-way player who will continue to improve w/ more opportunity & is a pain in the ass to play against.

9598 2018-02-27 01:26:21 Bingo.  Negotiating from weakness. Oil up over $10 since they announced sale and guidance and now guiding to low end of 2-300 range from back then.  Unbooked reserves highly “negotiable”

Many things are worse than an AR 1.  Boliling in oil skinning, beheading.  Does that mean, we don’t eliminate what we can?  Are you going be less safe if you don’t have  AR?  I don’t think so.

9625 2018-02-27 01:22:44 Some of the best times I have w my dad are when he's changing my oil or fixing my car.
9626 2018-02-27 01:22:20 Oil is dead? lol ok. Stuff goes up, stuff goes down. Can't explain that.
9627 2018-02-27 01:22:11 Listening to Prime Minister Rowley, and having first hand information about oil operating companies in Trinidad, he is 100% honest, of what the Energy Conference propagates and a Chamber represents. I agree human survival has it challenges and non is perfect. It is the effort...
9628 2018-02-27 01:22:11 Lol WHOOPS, I just reached for the olive oil, grabbed a bottle of wine from the pantry by accident and didn’t realize until I’d opened it. Guess we’re having wine with dinner!

9637 2018-02-27 01:20:58 If people are stealn ur deliveries off ur porch put a box out with a light coating of ghost pepper oil extract...then wait...for them to rub their eye or scratch their ass
9638 2018-02-27 01:20:56 I use this for both cuts and scars but vitamin e oil works. It might still scar, but it won’t be as bad and eventually the scars fade. For cuts, I use any kind of ointment for cuts or scrapes and vitamin e oil. For scars, I use a vitamin e sugar scrub ( sugar and vitamin e oil)
9639 2018-02-27 01:20:42 Concentrated lemon juice , garlic, cilantro chives, green onion, canola and virgin olive oil , sugar are the basic ones along with a couple other ingredients I can't spell. Just need to figure out the amounts of each ingredient.

9642 2018-02-27 01:20:25 I’m still angry the TSA didn’t let me take the coconut oil my mom bought me back home. #ashymonday 
9643 2018-02-27 01:20:19 Your bunker babble will be the stuff of history books some day under the header "how to recognize snake oil salespersons".
9644 2018-02-27 01:20:16 I love spending my time oil pulling.
9645 2018-02-27 01:20:03 just did two oil changes back to back and i’m so tired already lol

9647 2018-02-27 01:19:44 US props up the chaos in Libya by assisting all the warring factions to devour the Libyan sweet (ie oil). Haftar is just another American pawn in this vicious game. He'd been living comfortably in the US for 25 yrs & obtained his US citizenship before his assignment in 2012.

9649 2018-02-27 01:19:36 This is a blatant attempt by this @abndp Govt to infect and control the oil business that they so desperately want to nationalize.#abpoli #ableg
9650 2018-02-27 01:19:34 Yo AM,
Enjoy it n hope more happy moments amongst the players in the MU dressing room to overcome the MCFC oil monies that placed Manchester City up the EPL ranking ladder now... 
9651 2018-02-27 01:19:32 Because we stopped refining our oil and are at the mercy of foreign countries. Canadians pay more. Trump thinks we screw them too, but we sell our goods cheaper to them than ourselves
9652 2018-02-27 01:19:31 Don't fret! #NaturalHair is beautiful & @NimVedaAust, we believe that #NaturalProducts are the best. Have you tried Jojoba Oil? Our curly haired customers swear by its natural ability to add moisture and add bounce to naturally curly hair while defining curls. #AffordableOrganic
9653 2018-02-27 01:19:30 This is classic snake oil salesman behavior. Say whatever necessary to make the sale. Believe none of it. It's  just more lies. #TheResistance
9654 2018-02-27 01:19:30 diffuser on with  oil ... my room smells amazing 
9655 2018-02-27 01:19:29 Ito na naman ung araw na pag gising ko amg sakit sakit ng puso ko ang gulo gulo ng utak ko.  Ung para kong mababaliw,  gusto kong may inumin na gamot para tumigil ung mga kung anong naiisip ko,  pero ung nakita ko lang kanina sa bahay e fish oil.  Ininum ko na din.

9662 2018-02-27 01:18:50 I thought my baby just had a dry scalp, so I've been slathering her head in coconut oil. Turns out she has cradle cap, which is a fungus that thrives in warm, wet environments. #Whoops #ThatExplainsALot #MomFail #MomLife
9663 2018-02-27 01:18:20 Oil burning
9664 2018-02-27 01:18:02 Indy potholes: I almost lost the front of my car today on South Street (in front of Lucas Oil) from the motorist swerving to miss a pothole in their lane and not seeing me
9665 2018-02-27 01:18:01 too much oil 
9666 2018-02-27 01:18:00 I find it incredibly hypocritical to be so in favor of gun control but  vote to make wars on innocent countries in order to steal their oil,  their opium or their precious minerals.
9667 2018-02-27 01:17:52 If y'all are like me and don't know what cbd oil for migraines is, it is a cannabis based oil. So yours truly shared a Facebook post trying to win some cbd oil and my mom texted me saying I needed to delete it  oops.

9669 2018-02-27 01:17:47 I just wanted lavender essential oil I think I bought devil sauce
9670 2018-02-27 01:17:46 My @JDSnaturals body oil and pimple stopper has shipped 
9671 2018-02-27 01:17:33 Balsamic and olive oil is a good choice, but both lose out to a really good blue cheese dressing.  Thousand Islands is for hamburgers (see Big Mac) and maybe seafood salad....French is reserved for Texas style Frito salad.
9672 2018-02-27 01:17:20 A2: Deep breaths, calming music, dim lights, and "calm" oil in my diffuser. I've been told by other teachers that my room has a very calming mood. It definitely helps! #admin2b #eda655

9675 2018-02-27 01:16:42 43,452km (27,000 miles) of oil pipelines were constructed & given permits by Obama!  That's more than enough to circle the equator! Obama gave a speech at the Paris accord, about climate change, then went back to Washington DC and signed permits for big oil 2 drill n the Arctic!
9676 2018-02-27 01:16:28 You know like artisanal or gourmet olive oil??? Same thing
9677 2018-02-27 01:16:27 drinking organic virgin unrefined coconut oil is excruciating...
9678 2018-02-27 01:16:26 Using coconut oil for literally everything at the moment and everything is better because of it
9679 2018-02-27 01:16:13 ทำไมไม่รู้ว่าน้องมาTT
9680 2018-02-27 01:16:01 As long as we can benefit from it yes. Canada has sold out far too long to big oil that just wants oil to be shipped to USA, refined,  then shipped back to Canada at grossly inflated prices!
9681 2018-02-27 01:15:58 Venezuela had 3 different Govs from 1980 onwards, the downfall wasn't due to 'Socialism' quite the opposite, their Oil Reserves dried up they had no income, therefore they couldn't sustain the Social Security of the Citizens. That's why they are starving.
9682 2018-02-27 01:15:56 Oil is hard to ship or sell, Petros are easy. #reasons If they had a real backing, and did a good job with managing the Petro, it is quite possible that nobody would ever redeem it for the backing because they'd have to take a loss vs. selling petros on the market and buying oil.
9683 2018-02-27 01:15:51 Remember the time Simon Bridges voted for oil drilling in the marine sanctuary that holds the last of our 55 Maui dolphin. Yeah. Not sure I’m keen on your ‘vision’.
9684 2018-02-27 01:15:41 Is skinning them alive and then throwing them, still alive, in boiling water or oil also a custom? Is killing domestic animals ok in countries where the “custom” is illegal (S Korea for example). If one MUST kill an animal to survive, it is quite easy to do it in a humane way
9685 2018-02-27 01:15:38 But shia and logic mix like oil and water
9686 2018-02-27 01:15:21 ...and you want to sell the pristine coastal waters of your state to the highest oil bidder. What will you tell your constituents when an oil spill contaminates everything?? “Oops!”
9687 2018-02-27 01:15:17 You can exfoliate your lips once a week by using sugar and olive oil.
9688 2018-02-27 01:15:08 There are no “superfoods”
Or “magical foods”. There are just foods that are more nutritious and beneficial to health and body than others. These include: Raw honey, Dates, EV olive oil, walnuts, wild blueberries, kale, sweet potatoes, wild salmon, figs, oatmeal,broccoli, eggs,etc

9692 2018-02-27 01:14:29 You hadn't interacted with him previously? (in the inquiry, not snarky)
Conway was chief financial officer of Arbusto Energy Inc, an oil and gas exploration firm operated by George W. Bush.
9693 2018-02-27 01:14:19 Where in Alberta?  East coast that uses imported oil not Canadian!
9694 2018-02-27 01:14:13 @WVGovernor Can I use the rubber in your face to create a dog toy? My dog keeps destroying my oil barrels.
9695 2018-02-27 01:13:57 So  the new leader of the national party is a guy who once said quote,  Dolphins are fish and i read lots of books, good luck with that. when Energy Minister, Simon Bridges  signed off the biggest forest park in the country for oil exploration,  despite never having heard of it.
9696 2018-02-27 01:13:42 Yesyess.. I just did a coconut oil treatment to it & honestly it's softer, but flatter than ever. No blowdryer or mousse can help.
9697 2018-02-27 01:13:34 From the article that no dumbass con will read "Without doubt, much of the lost investment was due to the downturn in world oil prices and to the fact that we cannot get pipelines built that will take our oil to international markets – neither of which is the fault of the NDP."
9698 2018-02-27 01:13:31 Agree...valid point! But if Venezuela had issues getting rid of the oil before..not sure how crypto   would help It! Maybe I am thinking too much into this!
9699 2018-02-27 01:13:18 Not Oil?
9700 2018-02-27 01:13:18 less caffeine, chamomile tea, breathing exercises, yoga, read more, start a journal, jogging, volunteer, oil diffusers, coloring books, long baths, face masks, massage therapy, cannabis... girl whatcha need — I gotchu. 
9701 2018-02-27 01:13:15 CAN does not live in isolation. Our contribution 2 global GHG’s is nominal. As CAN is forced to shut down its economic engines, the rest of the world will pick up the slack. CAN needs to take the blood diamonds of the oil world out of the equation in order to reduce global GHG

9709 2018-02-27 01:12:19 @realDonaldTrump there’s  pipelines that pump oil all across the country, Canada etc...why not a pipeline pumping water to the west coast that seems to always be in a drought ?Could something like this prevent floods or at least keep floods to a minimum in the Midwest?

9714 2018-02-27 01:11:34 If it were backed in oil, in the event that the token value drops below the price of oil, people who use oil would have a reason to buy the token since it represents a discount to the price of oil.  If you can only exchange it for hyperinflating bolivares, no buyer demand
9715 2018-02-27 01:11:24 Can't sell 'em oil?
9716 2018-02-27 01:11:12 What’s it like to have parents that actually praise you lol mine cuss me out for getting an oil change
9717 2018-02-27 01:11:08 Yep same here. I decided this would be the day I went back to the gym. Instead I changed the oil in my truck and bought a strawberry cheesecake. Fuck I'm fat.

9724 2018-02-27 01:10:42 Unfair Gary, now I'll have to just avoid oil painting.
9725 2018-02-27 01:10:34 Ok needing some new luggage for air travel, I’m needing both a nice carry on roller bag for a couple day trip and a large roller bag for a couple week trip. Let me know what you like and why (remember I just a country preacher with a Bible I don’t own an oil well)!!
9726 2018-02-27 01:10:33 @RealDonad_Trump You would have run into that school!  Right.  You can't stand up to your buddies who want to destroy our land and seas with oil and dirty fuel; you can't stand up to the NRA for longer than a day of blustering nonsense.

At worse, he’s a fake HS adult (possible 2015 graduate Redondo Beach CA) using the school as a cover to incite action against @NRA and supporting legislators.

9730 2018-02-27 01:10:08 I still have 48% oil life left and a little over 2k miles before I have to change the trans fluid and filter. The gear oil i try to change every 10-15k miles because of the metal shavings its causing
9731 2018-02-27 01:10:05 When your fresh herbs are on the way out (aka starting to turn brown or are wilting), don’t toss them! Instead, put chopped herbs in ice cube trays, fill with olive oil, and freeze.
9732 2018-02-27 01:09:47 It's a start  drop the export  push ..  the slight change  in your approach is commendable @RachelNotley  yes defend the oil industry but make sure it's like this for the betterment all Canadians not  just the profits of foriegn Owners of the company
9733 2018-02-27 01:09:05 Kind of annoying that coconut oil is in damn near everything now...some people are sensitive to it ya know.
9734 2018-02-27 01:09:04 My favorite veggie sandwich of all time had very thinly sliced veggies that were piled up and then toasted in an oven... a really good oil/vinegar/spice mix and a little cheese.

9737 2018-02-27 01:08:32 I put a raw garlic clove in the outer part of my ear next to the outer canal. It out gassed oil into my ear & the tissue absorbed it as needed. That gently released the ear drum from the eustachian tube & when I lifted my head later the ear drum freed up.The oil kills microbes to
9738 2018-02-27 01:08:13 Epic mini-stick game with my daughter & we knock my wife’s magic “Essential” oil machine off the counter, cracking me on top of my head. Didn’t knock me out..must have been saved by the magical elixir. If it had, they’d likely sell one under an obnoxious new name like “Blackout”.

9744 2018-02-27 01:06:46 So when @ secretaryzinke will you be leasing oil rights to fossil fuel industry next door to this beauty?
9745 2018-02-27 01:06:35 Our lawmakers need to vote on this. Their constituent should know where they stand. This bill would constitute a repeal of the Second Amendment.
9746 2018-02-27 01:06:26 And what the hell is this y’all putting this metallic ass oil on yalls face under your foundation. Looking like the damn tin man.
9747 2018-02-27 01:06:12 Apparently all other warming/cooling trends have been caused by time traveling Oil & Gas CEOs
9748 2018-02-27 01:06:04 Oh god, I would too. Also, I can't remember if I asked for my salmon to be prepared with olive oil and lemon, which was the only palatable option
9749 2018-02-27 01:05:44 Daaaaamn.  What an amazing ass.  I love the oil.  Very sexy.  
9750 2018-02-27 01:05:31 I never said I expect them to fulfill small amounts, but I would expect an oil producing nation to fulfill at the industrial level (tanker or more).  1 Petro = 1 barrel, VZ gov gets it to the port, buyer pays for everything else.
9751 2018-02-27 01:05:28 No.  We can still buy box cutters and terrorize people with them.  We didn't ban the sale of them.  And we don't profile when grandma is getting a TSA patdown.

That’s why he elected trump for prez so 45 can lift sanctions 2 transfer oil from Alaska! & tillerson got something to do with it

9756 2018-02-27 01:04:25 Never. Unlike Syria, Libya's insecurity doesn't constitute a direct threat to Russia. Haftar is an American citizen and had been living in the US for 25 years before 2012. The US wants chaos in Libya to bear a sway Libya's oil. Haftar is just another pawn of America.
9757 2018-02-27 01:04:23 Sir oil made any sign of top ???
9758 2018-02-27 01:04:09 Fun Fact: Plastic can be made from oil
9759 2018-02-27 01:03:59 Look like oil settlement price will only get closer to price magnet every two months?

9761 2018-02-27 01:03:55 Update: freshly shaved the Emperor and his subjects (my privates) took a very relaxing soothing long hot shower, proceeded to lather myself in lotion and baby oil because I have the skin of a raptor and I feel amazing, so yes guys can feel that level of satisfaction 
9762 2018-02-27 01:03:46 Two US refineries closed for maintenance. Over $1.42 a litre here. No bitumen in the pipe.  Pipe us some refined oil like gasoline and diesel
9763 2018-02-27 01:03:45 I can't help but laugh when people with naturally perfect skin tell you to use coconut oil and Neutrogena face wash
9764 2018-02-27 01:03:44 @Partisangirl Oil is also what is behind General Taylor's uncovering of the US plan to take out 7 Mideast nations in 5 years.  That is still continuing although a little behind schedule.  Now Syria, then Iran.

9766 2018-02-27 01:03:39 Too bad our environment minister @cathmckenna won't acknowledge this. Too busy backing a Texas oil company I suppose.
9767 2018-02-27 01:03:28 "oil" 
9768 2018-02-27 01:03:27 Because like all countries other than the United States, they believe in global warming and know oil is a fail.
9769 2018-02-27 01:03:16 theyre loterally drenchedddd in oil & butter its disgusting
9770 2018-02-27 01:03:09 Oil changes are so expensive....I need to find someone to do it for less lol
9771 2018-02-27 01:03:00 I didn't know plastic was made from oil. That was a stupid Q1 question
9772 2018-02-27 01:02:54 Ok. This morning, about half an hour after I first took the oil my nerve started to pop/crackle. Thought it was coincidence. Took some more oil about an hour ago and it's just started doing the same thing. When it's popping some of the pressure/sensations/pain are lessening.

9775 2018-02-27 01:02:31 October of 14 the industry was officially calling it a crash. The hardship started with a glut of oil and a massive price crash. Just cuz you want something to be true, doesn’t make it so.
9776 2018-02-27 01:02:30 oh god these korokke turned out awful. The first few I fried are ok but one of them bursted and just fucked up the oil

You're also correct.
9778 2018-02-27 01:02:21 Do you have any oil license ? Why not ?

9780 2018-02-27 01:02:15 Just reading here, but we will rely on oil for generations to come. And global demand is increasing. Solar & wind renewable energy cannot support Canada. The infrastructure is not in place. Sorry, carry on folks....
9781 2018-02-27 01:01:55 J.P. Morgan chose to work in banking, which exerts strong influence in the oil, railroad, and steel industries. He loaned more than $60 million to ensure the government would escape financial crisis and reorganized several fiscally troubled companies. @CarplukAPUSH #PMAPUSHhw29
9782 2018-02-27 01:01:30 So in essence all I’m saying is cheaper imports mean more to us than cheaper exports. There are goods which we simply cannot survive without and will import regardless (eg crued oil) therefore demand of those goods will not be affected much by price increases
9783 2018-02-27 01:01:11 They are thinking ahead. Age of peak oil is gone
9784 2018-02-27 01:01:08 President Obama, or don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.
9785 2018-02-27 01:01:05 4 cups yields about 1.5-2 cups of cheese, and you get pretty much 4 cups of whey at the end.  Its a bit salty/tart from the vinegar. It's crazy wasteful to dump it out! So perfect smoothie base. I like adding mango, raspberries, a bit of MCT oil and whatever else I can scrounge
9786 2018-02-27 01:01:04 @Partisangirl What is really behind the US attacks on Israel is the OIL.  The Russians got an agreement with Assad to rebuild Syria's infrastructure in exchange for the oil.  Now the US wants the oil without paying for it.
9787 2018-02-27 01:01:01 OIL DIFF: 3.54 -> 3.54
9788 2018-02-27 01:00:49 I also make a mean churrasco. Chopped garlic, onion, parsley, olive oil, salt, pepper, and fresh lemon/lime juice. The secret is in massaging the spices into the meat.
9789 2018-02-27 01:00:38 Ill never forget in kindergarten this one kid said his mom put oil (coconut) in her hair to moisturize it and later that day the kids put pizza slices on his head during lunch because it was oily. He cried and was like NOT THAT KIND OF OIL!!! And all the kids cried with him
9790 2018-02-27 01:00:35 got an oil change today, tires rotated, paid my ticket, accepted a job promotion. shits good
9791 2018-02-27 01:00:30 *penguin now oil the floor and glide on that bih
9792 2018-02-27 01:00:18 I made my own laundry detergent for a few years when my kids were babies, I am a big recycler, I use sweet almond oil or coconut oil as moisturizer, I clean my showers with vinegar....
9793 2018-02-27 01:00:16 It’s the WORST. I used a magic eraser on my face once when I was younger so it was severe. After that the other two times were from Proactiv! But it goes away fast if you keep up w moisture and exfoliation gently. Also coconut oil helps a bit too. I hope that helps 
9794 2018-02-27 01:00:12 OIL DIFF: 3.48 -> 3.54

9801 2018-02-27 00:59:16 Random fact- about 5% of Dubai’s GDP is oil based
9802 2018-02-27 00:59:12 :( I had to use aromatherapy (lavender oil) to calm me
9803 2018-02-27 00:59:05 Export Olive oil – looking for recommendations
9804 2018-02-27 00:58:51 I've heard good things about CBD oil for lots of things.  Keep doing your research. In the meantime, @SuzyCohen recommends magnesium to help with anxiety, along with a good B Complex. Good luck!

9808 2018-02-27 00:57:58 He’s a flamer, he should worry about his short game rather than what the Oil are doing!
9809 2018-02-27 00:57:42 Most modern German households use gas heating, some oil. This suburb has its own little power plant which supplies us with long-distance heating.
9810 2018-02-27 00:57:36 Didn’t Ralph Klein (pc) do the same thing to Alberta? Which is why they were in such dire straits when the oil market tanked.
9811 2018-02-27 00:57:22 What? Isn't this where we invade under the guise of freeing the people who yearn for democracy and rescuing them from dictatorship? China's oil reserves are like ours, guess we'll pass on invading...for now 
9812 2018-02-27 00:57:20 $20 for some coconut oil  Safaree’s ass better gone! That shit is already expensive af!
9813 2018-02-27 00:57:09 To keep a lamp burning we have to keep putting oil in it. Mother Teresa #JesusIsLivingWater
9814 2018-02-27 00:57:08 This is because most "green groups" are funded by American interests that want to landlock Canadian oil. Traitors as well as kooks.
9815 2018-02-27 00:57:05 I’m dying to know who this snake oil salesman is so I can avoid her or him before I get hoodwinked.
9816 2018-02-27 00:57:03 Fun fact: EVOO stands for extra virgin olive oil- in case you didn’t know... because I didn’t.  #TheMoreYouKnow
9817 2018-02-27 00:57:01 Why won’t the Government tell the people of Trinidad and Tobago that oil prices have gone up? They are getting more money, what are they using that money for? #UNCMondayNightForum
9818 2018-02-27 00:56:59 Gimmick , worse snake oil salesman since tim Brewster
9819 2018-02-27 00:56:58 I don't think you understand how the economics of the oil & gas industry work. The reason ther are not in WV now is due to low ngl/crude prices not the tax rate. #basiceconomics #blameopec
9820 2018-02-27 00:56:38 I find the word “attack” very loaded and often problematic. 

Scrolling through, I see you accuse others of being “scummy” “reprehensible” “violating laws” and calling them “snake oil salesmen”. I don’t see any name-calling against you. Could you help me locate these attacks?
9821 2018-02-27 00:56:23 Venezuela admits that the creation of its national cryptocurrency — called the Petro, as it is backed by the country’s oil — will help the country avoid financial sanctions
9822 2018-02-27 00:56:12 Oil did as well as expected on the trade front IMO...not sure what more could have been had...what would the naysayers say if Chiarelli had not traded Maroon at all?
9823 2018-02-27 00:56:07 I don't agree with Assad and his methods, but damnit he's better than most of the rebels we used to support. Just don't try taking any Kurdish oil fields in the future, eh 
9824 2018-02-27 00:56:06 He can’t even align his profile pic, not sure what round this kid is winning 
9825 2018-02-27 00:55:56 Oil is a dirty business, but us Canadians are pretty good at it. And safe as well. I am in Alberta right now. 
9826 2018-02-27 00:55:53 Oh Oil is DEAD K. O!
9827 2018-02-27 00:55:49 Either the Shea Butter got my scalp itching or that hair oil
9828 2018-02-27 00:55:48 Why don't you publicly support teachers and service staff?  Jim Justice wants to steal private property rights so oil/gas can make more $ before addressing education issues, and so do you!  #55strong #55united
9829 2018-02-27 00:55:46 Total nonsense. Prices for wind and solar are not even close to be competitive and some countries are getting out of it. They are not AFFORDABLE, Current low oil prices are caused by higher production due to US fracking. It is called *law of supply and demand*.
9830 2018-02-27 00:55:35 I know my life been busy when I forget to get an oil change
9831 2018-02-27 00:55:32 coconut oil clogs pores

9833 2018-02-27 00:55:26 Are takeaways, burgers, chips etc high in sugar? Or are they high in oil, grease and fat? Sugar is not the biggest problem.
9834 2018-02-27 00:55:23 Coconut oil is literally life! Lol especially for us curly heads 
9835 2018-02-27 00:55:21 I had this for a month. Put double the amount of recommended lavender oil in my diffuser and woke up CURED no joke

9842 2018-02-27 00:54:24 Me and Relax don't mix well!  Like oil and water! Yesssss JVR!!!
9843 2018-02-27 00:54:00 You’d think after the first time a shitload of oil was spilled into the ocean we would be a little more careful.
9844 2018-02-27 00:53:59 Is this a joke? They lose an oil tanker?!
9845 2018-02-27 00:53:57 Was any sesame seeds oil used? Asking for a friend.
9846 2018-02-27 00:53:49 and I cleaned my mokka pot. Since everyone is back I just drink what they make in the conventional pot, so I will put it away. If I'm diligent about removing the oil buildup in it from the coffee beans, the espresso it makes is always sweet.
9847 2018-02-27 00:53:48 Looks like they tried to fool ol Pete with the scorpion oil pattern. But he wasn’t having it. Not on that day. He was dialed in.
9848 2018-02-27 00:53:20 use coconut oil for your skin.
9849 2018-02-27 00:53:13 Trudeau will not honour that promise as he was stoned when he made it so ergo didn't remember making it so it never happened, This slippery piece of snake oil will never honour anything he says or does he's a liar cheat thief and worst Prime Minister Ever
9850 2018-02-27 00:52:52 Omg Hylas LOVES (or really hates? )the smell of the tea tree oil shampoo I use. If I even forget for a moment and lay down near him, he attacks my head. Hahah. What a goober.
9851 2018-02-27 00:52:51 Aloe Vera, jojoba oil, and then Shea butter on the affected area. It’s heavy, but you can’t let the burn dry out so all 3 will keep it moisturized throughout the day
9852 2018-02-27 00:52:47 When he was first rapped to the job, he thought energy secretary was only all about gas and oil.  He wasn’t aware that nuclear was part of the gig.  This whole shit show just continues to get more and more concerning.

9856 2018-02-27 00:52:10 I think all powers should be devolved. If we could also keep the oil, that is so on the up, then we would have no homeless, no food banks and no child poverty. I've had it with the UK Government. Inept and heartless.
9857 2018-02-27 00:52:06 I’m in a weightloss phase & im still eating the same foods as when I’m not trying to lose weight. instead of cooking my nightly popcorn with oil I air pop it. Weightloss isn’t deep. I had a cookie & a massive meal out out with my family. I’m down about 4lbs

9859 2018-02-27 00:51:59 Not to mention dishonesty and lying are nothing new. Snake oil salesman is a term for a reason. I just read a book on Japan's invasion of Korea 400 years ago. Amazing what one person could get away with saying because they're the sole source.

9868 2018-02-27 00:50:19 My dad said he could do my oil change... ended up making my bumper and front light come off of my car... if you know Brian you know how accurate this describes him
9869 2018-02-27 00:49:56 I think Independence for Scotland would be ace.We are a resource rich country with far greater commitment to equality and social justice than the UK. Let's use the oil, now many new developments in North Sea, to tackle poverty, encourage growth and improve services.
9870 2018-02-27 00:49:54 What if we never explored oil? Suppose we had like bio- power lol, like living energy providers. So instead of oil rigs and them thing deh we hook up to some power-plant lol
9871 2018-02-27 00:49:52 Guys, if you want to be hotter/sexier to a woman learn how to do something. Be able to work on a car (even if it's just changing the oil), be able to fix things around the house, clean, be good with technology, be a good dad, play guitar, etc. You are sexier when you do things.

9919 2018-02-27 00:43:18 China has tapped Australia for its lithium demand, coming next is CANADA! We love to give our resources away for next to nothing. Oil, Gold, Copper, Nickel. Why develop anything on our own and supply our country. China loves Canada. Give it away for the $$$'s!

9922 2018-02-27 00:42:36 I’m at a Chinese restaurant and I picked the spiciest one and I’m adding spoonfuls of chili oil lmaoo
9923 2018-02-27 00:42:34 i think some lubrication oil got into my left eye
9924 2018-02-27 00:42:32 I think Scotland will be the next country to gain Independence. The economy in UK looking bleak whilst oil is very much on the rise with many new developments in the North Sea. Also Scotland more committed to social justice. Different trajectory. Social housing building boom etc
9925 2018-02-27 00:42:22 HMMM! Most if not all of the 9/11 actors were Saudis. And now to keep the oil flowing you want to forgo non proliferation rules to give them nuclear power. Why don't we change to renewable energy? It's to keep the oil corporate money flowing.

9927 2018-02-27 00:41:57 If they don't have the balls to come forward and show their names and faces, then once they are discovered, and they eventually will be, they should all be terminated immediately.
9928 2018-02-27 00:41:45 Box cutters are the weapon of choice for hijackers.  So those tools of death I used at the grocery store back in the day...
9929 2018-02-27 00:41:38 The thing done by the corporate overlords is that they give politicians cash and said politician will push whatever agenda the corporation wants. Whether it's oil subsidies, going after workers rights, whatever, those puppets will push it
9930 2018-02-27 00:41:27 You need to get me some coconut oil....I’m really scared tho cause you know my face sensitive and shit. I can only use hot water 
9931 2018-02-27 00:41:26 Hada labo oil cleanser is good for daily makeup remover before I cleanse my face using normal cleanser. My skin is very dry so this product absolutely great. I’m on my 2nd bottle now 
9932 2018-02-27 00:41:24 Dawg the crude oil took me out 
9933 2018-02-27 00:41:23 "this house runs on love, tacos and essential oils"

alright the only essential oil yall need is lube but go off i guess
9934 2018-02-27 00:41:00 Ready for some @TheWCWolfpack basketball from #capecoral on @KSOU_NEWS #gopack #carolwho?
9935 2018-02-27 00:40:54 I'm the oil version of the tooth fairy. Put money under your pillow I'll give you oil.
9936 2018-02-27 00:40:45 Again funded by the oil rich sugar daddies. Merely funded by soft loans from the arabs, not through organic investment which well run clubs have to generate themselves. City are a little club at heart, trophy record skewed massively purely due to luck. You Shlags
9937 2018-02-27 00:40:41 Anything is going to be cheaper to KSA government than massively subsidized oil for electricity. 

And You know nuclear power is never solely about the cost of power. Prestige, geopolitics, weapons, relationships, etc.
9938 2018-02-27 00:40:40 Need to get the rest of that Shea Moisture castor oil line. Actually works for me
9939 2018-02-27 00:40:37 @hunkydorydurham what is the name of those #CBD oil pens you have up there? What brand were they?

9942 2018-02-27 00:40:04 Disappointed that the national party has chosen to elect a leader that is in the pocket of big oil. It will take climate change minister @jamespeshaw @NZGreens  to expose the damage bridges will cause #simonbridges #nationalpartyleader

9946 2018-02-27 00:39:44 Why does Saudi Arabia, with all of its oil fields and all of its blazing sun need NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS?
9947 2018-02-27 00:39:41 Without oil and coal, the whole world is dirt! :-)

But here we are.
9948 2018-02-27 00:39:33 I want to paint one of those old timey renaissance paintings with the strange proportioned ladies with pale skin, pink blush, and like a smooth greenish background. That takes skill though. And oil paints.
9949 2018-02-27 00:39:29 Think they also need to be informed in case they think the oil has disappeared. North Sea production has received a recent boost from new developments. Looking good.
9950 2018-02-27 00:39:17 Not even..  he always played well here I though.  I don’t like the “team building” that Chiarelli is taking
9951 2018-02-27 00:39:13 they said my oil change would take an hour so its time to pop a motha fuckin uuuuuuuhhhh
9952 2018-02-27 00:39:12 i was making a 80s playlist bc u inspired me to! my other faves are "sweet dreams" by eurythmics, "boys don't cry" by the cure, "i ran" by a flock of seagulls and "the dead heart" by midnight oil aaa 
9953 2018-02-27 00:39:07 Neem oil is a good repellant that won't hurt his lil nose
9954 2018-02-27 00:39:05 I’m looking for German camomile essential oil. Also just bought some Bay Rum. Can anyone guess what I’m making?
9955 2018-02-27 00:39:03 what a load of bs! we have to sell our "oil" at a steep discount because of its poor quality and extra cost involved in refining it!
9956 2018-02-27 00:39:02 Without oil, and the history of oil, Texas is dirt.
9957 2018-02-27 00:39:01 A PETR4 estava em cima da banda de bollinger superior na sexta. Com o fechamento de hoje, ultrapassou a banda superior. Estpu comprado em call, mas vou ficar atento para virar para put. Vai ter correção em breve. Na quinta sai o estoque de oil americano. Pode ser a deixa para uma
9958 2018-02-27 00:38:51 All I found after googling is oil... XD
9959 2018-02-27 00:38:46 Well, now the Party of Guns Oil Putin demands no exploration of 45s finances. This of course, the most likely area of his corruption. Sad
9960 2018-02-27 00:38:39 It's just about a discount
They did not ban them from flying
It's just a damn discount and the conservative are acting like this was equivalent to an oil spill or the destruction of public land.
They are throwing a fit over a discount
Talk about privileged
9961 2018-02-27 00:38:28 花粉だらけの地域に行くとどうなるか…かなぁ。めっちゃ辛いぞ
9962 2018-02-27 00:38:20 Got this wild growth oil  tryna grow my hair to 18” 
9963 2018-02-27 00:38:19 They robbed me at the oil change place. 
9964 2018-02-27 00:38:18 A snake replies:
“Actually, we don’t produce oil and are becoming a bit fed-up with this myth being perpetrated by someone who cannot make up his mind whether or not Impact assessments on Brexit have been carried out or not.
As for that statement on the side of  a big red bus....
9965 2018-02-27 00:38:17 Does she shit in a box to protest the Dakota Access oil pipelines? I hope so. That would be such a powerful statement!
9966 2018-02-27 00:38:07 Oil will never stop. Ever. What a foolish thing to say.
9967 2018-02-27 00:37:55 Rubes and hillbillies have no money, even if they have a few pennies, they will be exploited by con-servative authors and snake oil salesmen. 
9968 2018-02-27 00:37:50 your mcm thinks papa johns is better than dominos... little did he know the garlic sauce is actually olive oil 
9969 2018-02-27 00:37:48 I was suspicious that cbd oil lotion would be snake oil, but I’m a believer now.
9970 2018-02-27 00:37:47 Oh yeah, oil services are the big deal now. Basically a tech industry that helps people all over the world find, extract, and refine oil (and gas). You'd have to have geology itself become irrelevant to kill the Houston tech cluster!
9971 2018-02-27 00:37:27 C'mon McConnell do it.  Bring it to the floor.
9972 2018-02-27 00:37:17 
9973 2018-02-27 00:37:06 Just needed to get out of 97's spotlight.

9975 2018-02-27 00:36:57 Dripping oil like a oil spill nigga
9976 2018-02-27 00:36:57 Parsnip fries with truffle oil with fresh parsley and vegan chive mayonnaise = WIN
9977 2018-02-27 00:36:56 Adding wine when the oil was too hot.
9978 2018-02-27 00:36:49 Then, yall never get yall oil changed and wonder why your car be fucking up .
9979 2018-02-27 00:36:48 This situation calls for a skateboard, several dozen bottles of olive oil and a box of tampons.
9980 2018-02-27 00:36:39 Try rubbing olive oil in your nose. It's good for your skin too.
9981 2018-02-27 00:36:36 Surprise surprise....
9982 2018-02-27 00:36:32 yes....dissapointing to say the least.......not sure if i trust Chiarelli with this team anymore
9983 2018-02-27 00:36:21 Gas - $1.49 per litre. It was $1.50 when a barrel of oil was $100.Now it's $63 a barrel & gas is going up past $1.50 for one reason-they can get away with it. - haven't had people screaming for a while,let's crank up the price-we'll drop it when enough noise is made-disgraceful.
9984 2018-02-27 00:36:04 Is it possible to ask you to imagine Texas without oil?
9985 2018-02-27 00:35:48 Letestu...... scores in first game back in CLB... @Oil_Drop

9988 2018-02-27 00:35:17 The fact that I’ve seen no new story telling the truth ab this Syrian crisis is sad. The United States and Israel just want that land for oil. Truth.
9989 2018-02-27 00:35:10 Gotta get some coconut oil too bah..  I been neglecting my hair
9990 2018-02-27 00:34:59 How is not being able to ship grain a climate problem? Or using trains for oil? Or dumping sewage into water? Where’s your logic in that?

9995 2018-02-27 00:34:14 That's low. I didn't even know stealing heating oil was a thing. Expensive stuff too
9996 2018-02-27 00:34:04 Do you feel like you have a say in how our government works? Do you support the oil wars? Will your officials vote to support your interests over their corporate donors? This is the real cause of gun violence.
9997 2018-02-27 00:33:53 You’re supposed to water tea tree oil down lol.
9998 2018-02-27 00:33:45 ไม่เป็นไร....

10001 2018-02-27 00:33:42 Grateful that I negotiated free oil changes when I got my new whip. I was curious and looked up the pricing for Mazda service and oil changes are expensive af!
10002 2018-02-27 00:33:38 Essential oil diffusing bracelets coming soon!
10003 2018-02-27 00:33:33 Hah. Jeff says if you get a filter and some oil, you can come over and he can change it for you. He does his own.
10004 2018-02-27 00:33:24 My 𝒫𝑒𝒶𝒸𝑒  Oil from #dōTERRA is in and I feel super relaxed

10006 2018-02-27 00:33:21 Cheguei em casa e escrevi nas notas um trechinho de oil on canvas; vai ser assim enquanto eu não puder sentar pra dedicar uma tarde inteira à essa história
10007 2018-02-27 00:33:15 JBLM compound is no hat/no salute. 

Also, in the summertime, the uniform is a light coat of oil and shower shoes.
10008 2018-02-27 00:33:08 Texas took a huge hit in the early 80s. We were a cattle, cotton and oil state. When all three of those collapsed the state should have been just as screwed as Michigan is...but it bounced back stronger and more economically diversified.
10009 2018-02-27 00:32:51 We will be converting all oil pipelines into pneumatic tubes for the purposes of transportation of humans and ponies. Get with the times!
10010 2018-02-27 00:32:48 Good cars, but yes, they are a bit on the smaller side. I have a buddy who has one and his is a 2012. He has almost 150k miles on it and has only had to change the oil and other routine maintenance. I sold 2 of them when I worked at Machens. They're fairly popular cars.
10011 2018-02-27 00:32:39 Simple oil face wash.
10012 2018-02-27 00:32:29 North Sea production recent boost from new developments – BP’s 130,000-bpd Quad204 & Premier Oil Plc’s Catcher 60,000-bpd fields. BP’s Clair Ridge & Statoil ASA’s Mariner project could add additional 155,000 bpd in the first half of this year, according to JBC.
10013 2018-02-27 00:32:28 He’s your boy! Also said oil would never go above $50 in his lifetime few years back 
10014 2018-02-27 00:32:24 Well, you've got aerospace, LA Air Force Base, and oil there, and LAX ppl. I used to live a mile away in Manhattan Beach, and there are the occasional super-rich Republicans there, but they're to classy to advertise for Trump.
10015 2018-02-27 00:32:18 sorry to but it :0 idk if you're allowed to put anything near your teeth, but diluted tee tree and peppermint oil is fantastic for relieving pain
