38 2018-04-04 23:56:22 20 months bud.  You underestimate the exponential rate the web facilitates new tech.   If this was a battery or chip... yes 20 years.  But what Ripple is doing with blockchain; months not years!  Coinbase is just an exchange.  Nothing ground- breaking sir.
39 2018-04-04 23:56:15 They need the short term volitility to make $ on their options. Two different games being played.The crypto stuff gets big moves, those of us long term have to tune out the noise.When $nvda drops, look back to the January prices for the last 3 years & listen to a Jensen keynote.

55 2018-04-04 23:53:51 Not FUD. Regulatory waking up. That’s good and bad. The good side of things is that crypto will be clensed of doggy tokens. The not so good... entire ecosystem might suffer a bit down the road. Just my 2 cents.

75 2018-04-04 23:51:09 Crypto Twitter: "crypto is like nothing else ever. It's unique and defies the rules."

Also Crypto Twitter: "based on how non-crypto assets work, we're in a subwave of a larger ABC correction, which will bounce off the 61.8% fib."

$btc $xvg $trx $nano $ltc $eth $storm
76 2018-04-04 23:50:56 Based on todays action, I'd buy. Reversed long downtrend the past 2 days.
77 2018-04-04 23:50:45 Crypto Market exchanges are still charging high fees to cash out alt coins with huge slippage .If alt coin is up the conversion is on spot prices so up or down it doesn't matter as it's indirectly corelated to fiat price.Alt Coin up equal more usd at the end.
78 2018-04-04 23:50:18 Just broke evens on #P3D its pretty good so far but this won’t last forever - I’ll continue to ride the wave until my target sell point which would be 2 days away if the growth continues! #PoWH3D #powh #Crypto #cryptocurrency

117 2018-04-04 23:45:58 It's not normally that lucrative, because crypto is unlikely to see many more OOMs, and thankfully, swatters are rare in the first place because most people are not sociopaths.

132 2018-04-04 23:44:05 Still me your favorite #crypto twitter accounts
133 2018-04-04 23:43:58 Done!!

135 2018-04-04 23:43:52 The power of shortcuts compels you.
136 2018-04-04 23:43:47 Did you know that @VinChain_io supports Crypto innovations! Also #VinChain   is creating a worldwide decentralized database of vehicle information  that is 100% transparent, reliable, and accessible by  everyone.
137 2018-04-04 23:43:41 Crypto Twitter is awfully supportive for being full of degenerate scumbags. You all are the best

141 2018-04-04 23:43:37 I never said that. But I am saying that Hodling is bullshit. If you are in crypto, better learn when to buy and sell.            “You will lose money only if you sell” — This is so wrong, you also lose money when you don’t sell at the right time

143 2018-04-04 23:43:28 I use $XRP for whatever I want to use it for.
What other people do with their crypto is none of your business.
144 2018-04-04 23:43:19 Accepting bribes? Surely they have every right to charge a listing fee?
145 2018-04-04 23:43:11 Really wow
146 2018-04-04 23:43:08 @NeerajKA  you get retweeted so often by the crypto twitter community that i just found out i dont follow you keep it up ppl are listening

149 2018-04-04 23:42:51 I know I’m accumulating more.  To think that 3 months ago we were feeling the FOMO of not buying more at these price levels and now we have another opportunity to buy at these levels. What a gift   #bitcoin #Blockchain #cryptocurrency #Crypto

153 2018-04-04 23:42:40 Bwaaah hahahah. Crypto is like buying cyanide, only good for one thing.

No offense

155 2018-04-04 23:42:30 Let’s see how people do with protecting profits or cutting losses...
When was the last time you cashed out some crypto for fiat?
156 2018-04-04 23:42:25 Saya trading crypto kak
157 2018-04-04 23:42:03 May I ask why exactly under $6800? 
Pretty new in TA, just wanna learn more about it, thanks.

163 2018-04-04 23:41:08 They need to get themselves a young korean hunk like Justin Sun to pump that motherfucker.
164 2018-04-04 23:41:04 Thats a moist GIF!
165 2018-04-04 23:40:59 I'm going short with a 1x leverage. I'd rather lose some BTC and see a bullrun than dipping with BTC. Good night twitter. 
$BTC
166 2018-04-04 23:40:09 You can still selling here and set the bids at 600$. Not late for now.

170 2018-04-04 23:39:27 whats up fellow leftists? today we are dragging @janet_meow_cat (full name: Jacob Reeves, works for IBM) for being a crypto-racist saying that neurodivergence has a biological component. be sure to report him for self-harm.
171 2018-04-04 23:39:20 hahaha that is how I felt with HTML at the top. I got into crypto in March last year and OMG was my first big wave I caught. But being from the stock markets seeing these surges I was ignorant and sold lower.
172 2018-04-04 23:39:11 #Facebook stock < #Crypto bear market
173 2018-04-04 23:39:10 It’s him! #cryptoking
174 2018-04-04 23:39:04 Or a couple  
175 2018-04-04 23:38:03 For me not really about that.. perhaps location would help someone understand the situation about a certain society better and learning about the circumstances.. let's say if doc is in korea.. i would like to know why do the koreans are bullish about xrp? Now we are based on msm
176 2018-04-04 23:37:55 I believe in Crypto.  Which token will come out on top, don't know.  I'm still HODLing.1 world government, 1 religion, 1 monetary system.  Can't be stopped. It is Written. 
177 2018-04-04 23:37:48 I see you RT'ing anticommunist crypto-libertarians like Crimethinc, It's Going Down, and Submedia and it's like either there's a huge disconnect or you're more interested in disliking DSA than any actual anticommunism

179 2018-04-04 23:36:49 And crypto is a portable roulette, which you periodically spin to see how much money you actually have.
180 2018-04-04 23:36:35 The south African crypto market is maturing at an awesome rate 
181 2018-04-04 23:36:23 1999/2000 was a better version of 2017/18

It had better:
- presidential sex scandals (cigar!)
- market crises (dot-com > crypto trade war)
- political whoopsies (I invented the internet!)
- Feuds: Britney vs. Xtina, BSB vs NSync
- Fashion (i.e. the same fashion but not ironic)
182 2018-04-04 23:36:18 I have a feeling the same ppl are buying and selling to themselves... what kind of brain dead would be trading now?
183 2018-04-04 23:36:07 No Suppo No Crypt0 No Crypto daily.
184 2018-04-04 23:35:46 Are you free

186 2018-04-04 23:35:14 Exactly. But then you hear how he received threats. I do not care how greasy he may be or not even. Noone deserves that. We must all be responsible for our actions. Crypto. Let alone on top of that low sat crypto is mega high risk. Gota ride the waves.
187 2018-04-04 23:35:14 If #btc #crypto drops to $6,650, we expect a strong bounce. In case 6,6k cannot hold, then 6,4k..... let see what 6,6 can do first....
188 2018-04-04 23:35:11 Already out but thanks for the heads up
189 2018-04-04 23:35:09 All crypto went down like that for the couple of months. Not just CAT.
190 2018-04-04 23:34:55 It's just one day since the start of the ICO and the amount of investors  is growing rapidly! Let me remind you that first week investment bonus  is 15% #cryptocurrency #crypto #currency #investment #investing #cryptonews #blockchain #FreeZoneTokenSale #bitcoin #ICOs
191 2018-04-04 23:34:41 Yet they keep banging this crypto drum. Are they disingenuous or merely foolish? I’m hold for the 10-bagger from here, myself...
192 2018-04-04 23:34:33 Freedom is the main reason i'm in #crypto, freedom from domination and taxation slavery... #ThinkLitecoin
193 2018-04-04 23:34:31 There are no parallels with #bitcoin #bcash name debate compared to #Ethereum #etc none. As a start #Bitcoin begat all incentives and the rest followed. So ultimately without #bitcoin the rest wouldn’t exist. #crypto would just be a character in a super hero movie.
194 2018-04-04 23:34:27 @krakenfx, @Bitstamp work just fine for me?
195 2018-04-04 23:33:46 I figured it out and got the transaction completed instantly and with no transaction fee!
196 2018-04-04 23:33:26 連動性を見てるということですか？
資金の流れかたとか？
197 2018-04-04 23:33:25 Just makes me question their intentions. I guess time will tell.
198 2018-04-04 23:33:13 Using BNB for fees counts right?
199 2018-04-04 23:33:12 I hate coinbase taxing the hell out of ppl and uncertainty of using tether. Crypto has to fix this fiat to crypto transfer barrier
200 2018-04-04 23:33:03 アレクサ俺の嫁が変な発音でしゃべりかけると、そっちに順応しちゃって俺のキレイな発音の方を「わからない」というようになった。
ある意味賢いｗ
201 2018-04-04 23:32:56 Heh. Thought it meant a zoologist in pectore--you know, like "crypto-Nazi."  :)
202 2018-04-04 23:32:54 It takes time for a market to realize what really worth something. In crypto this is x10 worst. But one day a news or else will bring us at the same level of ETH and co & people will change their minds about $STRAT and the market will have no other choices to accept it
203 2018-04-04 23:32:51 With all of the funding that went into #crypto development in the past year alone, I find it impossible for this industry to die out - pending an all out global ban... aka welcome to the new era ladies and gentlemen.

結構優秀な通貨なんですかね？

Ppl who entered in 2017 may no longer be qualified as noobs as they have seen the manipulated FUD cycle for many rounds. If they haven’t dumped already, they wouldn’t now, indeed curious who are dumping.

244 2018-04-04 23:29:41 The most overused phrase in crypto, spouted by frightened investors trying to justify their holdings:

"Whales accumulating. Shaking out weak hands."
245 2018-04-04 23:29:22 Most of those are not legit. Only legit crypto stocks are HIVE BlockChain $HVBTF and $GROW.
246 2018-04-04 23:29:14 I think he means creating a virtual memory partition
247 2018-04-04 23:28:53 Those have to be some of the craziest reasons I have ever heard. Nothing but  speculation and emotions. All coins are overhyped its part of crypto. The goal is to get people interested to fund your project.smh.
248 2018-04-04 23:28:33 I want no such thing but I see that as the co-author of the SM paper you have completely personalized @ProfFaustus' criticisms.  This is a shame as your professional contributions are being obscured by venom.  I'd like to see them resurface is all.

252 2018-04-04 23:27:46 Dustin, ask yourself why Coinbase/ Gemini didn't take this amazing deal. Nobody is saying that Ripple wasn't acting in their best interest, were showing you that Coinbase/Gemini acted in their best interest and didn't add an unregistered, centralized security (shit) token.
253 2018-04-04 23:27:45 Was bored today and read bunch of analysts recent post's... Ambiguous comments everywhere.. Shame..afraid for their reputations.. Just call it for what it is Crypto is a dead man walking,  Market not far behind
254 2018-04-04 23:27:37 Completely agree, but seems easier for ICOs to go broke in no time with the price gouging in crypto. "During the gold rush its a good time to be in the pick and shovel business" comes to mind.

269 2018-04-04 23:23:54 And this isn’t a bad thing! Incentives help to get your foot in the door. In pilot if they actually see what this could do for their business and they sign up, you have a reference point for other targets. Ripple is lining up the dominoes waiting for the push.

271 2018-04-04 23:23:43 N & T, there is something more important to pull out of the article, exchanges playing by the (suspected) rules want to make sure XRP is an asset, not a security.  Our govt. hasn’t taken a stance.  There are too many risks, which is harming Ripples position to market XRP 4 liquid

277 2018-04-04 23:22:56 @CarpeNoctom in a ichi tweet a few days ago you showed adjusted settings, but divergence on the crypto ichi was set at 30. Shouldn't it be doubled (to 60) like the other ones?

469 2018-04-04 22:51:34 I had a problem with XRP because my perception of crypto was too vanilla - XRP didn't fit my perception as it's more of a banking mechanism than a 'crypto'. I trade it because it's very predictable & the volumes are good. I don't use/support XRP - it's just a commodity to me.

521 2018-04-04 22:42:36 Crypto is brand new - there are very few use cases (apart from ICOs) right now so the market will behave in a speculative fashion (with the addition of trading bots as never before). New participants and use cases for crypto will change market conditions away from speculation.
522 2018-04-04 22:42:27 As the value of the USD goes down the trader in me wants to buy low so I can sell high and buy more #crypto with the profits. 
Too bad the $USD doesn't solve problems like #Cryptocurrency does.

527 2018-04-04 22:41:48 But this is what i dont understand. The longterm health of the xrp esystem is based on increased liquidity. Wouldnt you agree, as much as we hate it, the only way to achieve this in the forseeable future is through a coinbase listing? Ripple offered 100m? Thats 1/3 of incntve pgm

659 2018-04-04 22:22:55 South Korean authorities have demanded that 12 crypto-exchanges re-negotiate custom agreements with customers so that the latter receive more rights. The main claims relate to restrictions on the withdrawal of funds. That's care about citizens

661 2018-04-04 22:22:36 What's going to sting more is your investment in a protocol that doesn't even need your XRP coins to work.

As much as it pains me as an ancap, it's true that 99% of the people opt for convenience and something that "just works" like Coinbase. So your approach has a lot of merit in the practical sense of bringing a crypto world into life.
717 2018-04-04 22:16:49 And better yet, as fiat inflates, crypto explodes. Flee the dollar and derail the war machine.

759 2018-04-04 22:12:48 The icos will suck money out of bitcoin and other reputable coins, essentially diluting the market and "devaluing" or "printing" more crypto. This is what's been happening the last few months and why bitcoin can't recover back to 20k.

776 2018-04-04 22:11:05 Fiat is not going to be devalued that much. If you think bitcoin will cause fiat to collapse, you are terribly mistaken. Bitcoin can devalue itself faster than fiat. With fiat, only the government can print money. With crypto, practically anyone can devalue by introducing icos

780 2018-04-04 22:10:49 Interesting that the IRD considers switching coins to be disposal and trigger taxation. I'm guessing that will have a chilling effect on NZ crypto players moving to new constructions.

800 2018-04-04 22:07:42 I am the only person I know who has seen The Forbin Project.  I've never even heard of Person of Interest.  HAL has become more a literary influence than a movie one, I think.  NSA programs, crypto... "HAL" has become a kind of short hand term in common use.
801 2018-04-04 22:07:38 You just keep digging.  Please put down the shovel.
802 2018-04-04 22:07:31 Went down the rabbit whole  of the $bch vs $btc argument. 99.9% of $bch people have been here less than a year which is questionable (all bots/scrubs?). It's the most tribal argument in crypto... Nothing to it other than "us vs them". Confident they only support to be "different"
803 2018-04-04 22:07:28 The fact we are in a crypto Twitter thread and you mention a 'crypto' that will aid banks. That says it all...
804 2018-04-04 22:07:08 To the contrary, I would prefer rational discussion to all of the ad hominems.  You attributed the word "meltdown" to party C based only on the opinions of party B.  That's not scientific.
805 2018-04-04 22:07:08 I remember in December there were 5886478 professional crypto gawds! Fast forward to today where the mkt is dead and where are those crypto gawds now?

809 2018-04-04 22:06:07 Coinbase will be gone or bought out within 5 years. Binance went from nothing to the top exchange in less than a year. When regulators make things difficult, they move to friendlier shores (Malta). As a result, they can soon offer fiat pairings. Multi coin one stop shops will win

812 2018-04-04 22:05:58 The other good news is that as the weeks and months pass us by less and less of the total market cap of the Crypto world is taken up by garbage. The more vulgar of scams are falling by the wayside on a regular basis. Purification is in progress.  $BCASH is gonna get whacked.

903 2018-04-04 21:58:53 Shoutout to to @ParityTech, I don't use your crypto currency stuff, but your WebAssembly stuff is really helpful for those of us writing @rustlang crates. I'm working on a compiler that now targets wasm thanks to crates like wasmi and parity-wasm!

905 2018-04-04 21:58:33 What’s wrong w wanting to get your currency listed on exchanges? All the others do it. You and every other BTC hippie just hate Ripple.
906 2018-04-04 21:58:23 Your right. Having a small team means there’s no way it can be successful. So fucking glad I didn’t invest in Ethereum. Dodged a bullet there.
907 2018-04-04 21:58:17 the "kingmaker" of coins.. ha!
I don't think @Coinbase should add anything new until they have protocols for insider trading
908 2018-04-04 21:58:11 hype doesn't lead to failure.Not meeting goals, not working hard and lack of marketing leads to failure. Alibaba holds more crypto patents than any other company. Where have most TRX devs come from? TRX will succeed. No other project has done as much work in the same amt of time

911 2018-04-04 21:57:33 bitcoin can stay the standard for crypto, that is not a bump on the road for xrp holders. to me, XRPTHESTANDARD means that XRP replaces swift regarding crossborder payments. Even if XRP would 'exceed' the marketcap of BTC, its not the same thing, but it would untie XRP from BTC
912 2018-04-04 21:57:32 I seriously can’t understand this.

If the market goes up/down or sideways, it's a win/win, crypto is a great idea but the big fish own most of the btc so will always be able to control it, a bit like the much bigger precious metals markets.

1043 2018-04-04 21:44:10 Bad, people are influenced by his tweets, how can crypto become part of everyday life when u have people like him. He shills a coin, people lose money and they don't come back. Simple.
1044 2018-04-04 21:44:10 And by news I mean directly related to coinbase. Not a general ripple policy related towards exchange listings. Thats not to say I dont think ripple are not doing a great job and the only real world use crypto out there. Just dissapointed by the communication on this matter.
1045 2018-04-04 21:44:09 In our extremely niche community and market, keys are the crypto currency that runs shit..... and in the  REAL WORLD they are considered an asset of sorts and a definite resource with a dollar value. this is all a huge fucking conspiracy since DAY ONE

1050 2018-04-04 21:43:42 I want to disagree but not sure I honestly can. Crypto in general is an entirely different animal now. I feel like the honeymoon phase is waning and people are like "oh, this isn't magic money that multiplies by itself. I have to actually try." And current ICO's are weaksauce
1051 2018-04-04 21:43:40 Nothing about $BTC or Crypto?
1052 2018-04-04 21:43:30 @CNBCFastMoney only focuses on negative crypto news and scams without bringing in positive influences and projects. When btc booms you just focus on price and call it a bubble.
1053 2018-04-04 21:43:26 Due to the fast-paced nature of the crypto community, marketing for blockchain startups can feel like an overwhelming experience. Startups need to build an active presence on different social media platforms, consistently engage with followers, and prove to the general
1054 2018-04-04 21:43:22 Besides, Ripple just handed over R29 million to charity.  If CB was that important to them, they would have offered a hell of a lot more than 1 million.

1156 2018-04-04 21:31:00 On top of that they will be decentralised in under a year, I feel decentralised exchanges will eventually become the gold standard of crypto trading, atomoic swaps are around the corner and blockport will utilise this tech so potentially a lot better but need to deliver

1169 2018-04-04 21:30:23 Don't try to act as a clown. Why do you try to get listed there? Yes, crypto was shaped by these exchanges. coinbase is mainstream exchange in US. You can devalue their role but it is very important in crypto.
1170 2018-04-04 21:30:17 :) Just thinking about it now, maybe you could do youtubes lives with some of the magazine. Maybe you already thought of that and it's a thing/feature coming on 21 crypto website :o

1178 2018-04-04 21:29:13 Of course I’m going to file, rather be safe then sorry. Especially now that Crypto has been rising.

1180 2018-04-04 21:28:56 @NanoTipBot !tip .0001 @jlppfeffer for writing one of the best articles on #Crypto out there.

1187 2018-04-04 21:27:36 After bull’s time it always comes a bear’s times. And vice verse.  Crypto market is way much faster one than any other market we know. Do I do believe we will at least test 20K ATH this year. And as a HODLer (well... 50% Hodler..) I hope we will break it.

1189 2018-04-04 21:27:07 John want to promote bitcoin again.  I guessed he still own a lot of bitcoin when it high price.  Crypto been unstable so many month now.  Why it deep so many time? Weird and no answer.
1190 2018-04-04 21:26:48 Meh, he asked which coins could pierce the top 50 and the hype around $zil is definitely there. So I wouldn't be surprised 
1191 2018-04-04 21:26:37 Pretty talented but def low experience.  He could do a much better job accomplishing what he wants stealthy.
1192 2018-04-04 21:26:25 @RealistNews here's a crypto song. "Never going to give you up, never going to let you down, never going to run around and desert you - I'll just hodl you!" Lol #RickAstley
1193 2018-04-04 21:25:38 Oh it’s def not going away and there is real volumes.   It’s just so obvious.
1194 2018-04-04 21:25:35 I would never encourage False Fud campaigns. Endorsing is quite different than incentivized badmouthing.  Endorsing is a market strategy, but incentivized-bad-mouthing defeats the spirit of crypto altogether. What are you referring to @Marcintosh84 ?
1195 2018-04-04 21:25:24 Every crypto has the potential to be a non-sovereign monetary store of value. Literally every single one.
1196 2018-04-04 21:25:23 Is there anything significant planned before Q3?
1197 2018-04-04 21:25:16 Yildirmaya calisiyorlar ve basariyorlar. Ne zaman ki yukselicek bu sayfayi kapatip gidenler ve hic btc yatirim yapmayipta yukseldikten sonra yatirim yapmayi dusunen kisiler var. İnsanlar gelip o zaman btc alimi yapacaklar. Bu sadece benim dusuncem. Yaniliyor olabilirim.

1206 2018-04-04 21:24:04 This is a super weak boast.

Also it's actually third from the top. The top is the Karpeles AMA.

Also here's another post from the same redditor who "organically" posts praise of Roger: "The BCH girl in that Crypto J-pop band is gorgeous."
1207 2018-04-04 21:23:51 I never said it was faster, I said #BTC was far further its experimental development and handles way more transactions. You are representing @Ripple with no evidence, only math that didn't even make sense, because you pulled it straight from your ass. Prove something.
1208 2018-04-04 21:23:37 How’s BCH price chart look since listing on coinbase announced? So much ado about nothing. Bear market in crypto impacting all assets.

Can buy back in at lower levels and get the same holding but not advice. Crypto needs a systematic shift
1211 2018-04-04 21:23:16 Hey crypto.lols thanks for the follow!
1212 2018-04-04 21:23:04 @n00bqu33n Really good interview, thank you for sharing your ideas on crypto. 
Almost finished issue 6 tonight. Lots of information and new things to learn deeper Keep it up !
1213 2018-04-04 21:22:51 Oh, fuck off. Don’t tell me you believe in all that “defending our rights” propaganda bullshit. I went to Iraq and Afghanistan having had that bs jammed down my throat and none of it is true and you’re a fucking idiot if you believe it.

1216 2018-04-04 21:22:26 But we cant have it both ways. When we are not listed - its irrelevant. Only to learn ripple tried to buy its way onto the exchange. And coinbase isnt just about speculation. Its the gateway to a huge market that we need if we are to increase liquidity.

1219 2018-04-04 21:21:45 I’m asking two quick questions across groups/chats/social to finish a research project about $CRYPTO

1. At what level would you think “ wow that’s low let me buy some” ?
2. In your opinion at what level would the mass start buying due to “FOMO” - below 3k or above 15k?

1221 2018-04-04 21:21:20 Whats your thoughts on the energy consumption crypto will consume if it was to reach anywhere near 1 million i dont feel like that is sustainable?

1225 2018-04-04 21:20:52 Sorry, but you've lost already, plus, whatever credibility you may of had, in the past, has gone, just by making the statement that BTC is faster than XRP LOL. Go research it, then come back when you can speak intelligently. Thank you #xrparmy #xrp #ripple #xrpthestandard

1228 2018-04-04 21:20:36 @cryptostaker I followed your call on $VIB, Love you man ! You're making us earning great profit !!! So nice to have a crypto Robinhood like you to us help nowadays !!
1229 2018-04-04 21:20:27 When you think about it, that is exactly what Goldman Sachs are doing. Bad mouthing #crypto on one side and on the other side quietly acquiring @Poloniex
1230 2018-04-04 21:20:26 #Verge, $XVG, has tried to fix the hash attack on their blockchain by accidentally doing a hard fork. Additionally, it looks like the security issue remains unsolved...

Recommendation: SELL now before it dumps more and don't buy again until everything is cleared out

1233 2018-04-04 21:19:35 Agree with the part that many ICOs are scams. But the true vision of crypto was Decentralisation. They weren't meant to be "heavily" regulated. Of course I am against illegal things, but people should learn that....
1234 2018-04-04 21:18:55 So scared of the objective criticism of @Ripple. But I guess, you need to silence the science method and claim a hypothesis before its been tested at full scale (one of many issues). I'm confused, because there is a grown adult man in your thumbnail, but you sound like a child

1290 2018-04-04 21:14:00 Bitcoin & other crypto currencies are troublesome because we as people are so used to having an overpowering authority rule our lives, laws & our economy... often with fraudulent intent & trouble that we usually overlook.

1350 2018-04-04 21:06:43 XRP transactions are nowhere close to the scale of #BTC transactions. You hear the same jargon with many coins that claim to be the next #BTC, but its no where close to the experimental development stage of #BTC

1358 2018-04-04 21:05:48 If the price of BTC crashes, it will not only hurt BTC, but it will hurt all cryptocurrencies because investors will assume all crypto fails if the biggest and first does. Your gonna have a hard time rebuilding confience after that.

1362 2018-04-04 21:05:36 That’s a good point, they’ve also declined to list any other assets as well. I’m sure they’ve been pursued by more or less everyone who wants to grow in this space. Charlie Lee worked there to get LTC listed and then jumped ship.

1370 2018-04-04 21:04:49 So true! I’ve realised as I get older I get a new obsession once or twice a year that I then thread into my life. 2016 was wildlife photography (now sell stock imagery). 2017 was learning to drive and then crypto. 2018 so far is trading. My friends just roll their eyes 
1371 2018-04-04 21:04:47 Like any other crypto who was to listing at exchange... my god how many fool fud around ripple...
1372 2018-04-04 21:04:43 so did i miss anything in crypto world?
1373 2018-04-04 21:04:40 allright you are the boss :) just wanted you to know... but dont agree with with ETN project.... its a long term crypto not short
1374 2018-04-04 21:04:25 Maybe. But I don't buy the whole coinbase is irrelevent argument. Like it or not they are the gateway to the US and European markets. Thats huge. And if we are looking for liquidity we cant rely on the exchanges we are not listed on becoming irrelevant at some point in the future
1375 2018-04-04 21:04:25 I don't need to disprove anything, even the article says that paying to get listings are normal practices. This happens when you have a real company behind a real product. The argument are the subjective comments the author made. This doesn't affect #xrp price, at all.
1376 2018-04-04 21:03:53 Ripple is not trying to solve a spectators problem.
1377 2018-04-04 21:03:46 Coinbase first have to be able to handle the new volume that will be coming in and with the current state of the market and regulations itd be like shooting blanks. Later down the line depending on how it all unfolds could be beneficial. Remember, you can only launch once

1399 2018-04-04 21:01:49 dump fraudulent schemes.  

For as long as exchanges and ICOs remain unregulated there will always be "McAfees".

Only when regulations are in place, institutional investors will enter and then #crypto will reach its potential which is far greater than 20 or 50k.

1450 2018-04-04 20:58:08 The arguement that owning a large quantity of xrp makes it centralized or a security is garbage. There's BTC whales out there, does that make it a security? Ripple is utilizing xrp, no different than you or I. 90% of Diamonds are owned by DeBeers, diamonds aren't securities

1453 2018-04-04 20:58:00 I also spoke with 5 highly influential and involved people in the crypto space, including those 4 who didn’t want to be known who talked to Bloomberg, that Ripple is much more interested in other areas for XRP, and not being listed on Coinbase or Gemini. Mkay?

1462 2018-04-04 20:57:02 hello
1463 2018-04-04 20:57:01 The people need to leverage their power! It is a fact to be realized that #cryptocurrency will be legitimized in the near future. The demographic of opponents needs to understand that the sooner they cherish #crypto, they will realize the power of unity for positive change!
1464 2018-04-04 20:56:45 I expect a dip in crypto / but will rally to mania by end of year.
1465 2018-04-04 20:56:34 66% gain in 7 days with a market cap or 6.6B. 

You would have to put 4.3 billion dollars into the volume. to make 10.7B

That would give you a $200 LTC approx. 

BTC would need to be at approx. 12k for that to happen. It’s just math. no emotion.
1466 2018-04-04 20:56:27 False. Sharding in the only secure way to scale. DYOR. Transaction speed without security is worthless.
1467 2018-04-04 20:56:16 This is really good, it will normalise the crypto world, and bring some new money in. Many of my ultra-conservatives friends still see BitCoin as the payment method of choice for organised crime.

1479 2018-04-04 20:54:52 If I would own a compititor exchange to coinbase, I would love to have always all news and updates.

So if ripple would come to my exchange to listing xrp, I would use the Infos like bullets.

So it is healthier for companies to wait till everything is completed and done.

1486 2018-04-04 20:54:05 I don't understand the strong  hype/shilling for this coin. Seems like yet another niche utility token with hypothetical future use cases. That said, I bet it'll pump soon cuz hype rules in crypto.

1550 2018-04-04 20:47:11 Not necessarily. A national currency can be digitized and used on a dlt platorm while the platform's native asset still functions as fuel and such. Blockhain adoption in this sense can cause a surge in crypto value.

1583 2018-04-04 20:45:20 ey! thats crypto! yay. A doesnt know B and its based on a trustless network (not trustful). And where is Ripple different there? is Bitcoin unique in that vision? or are there 1500 coins with the same principle, but working on different types of blockchains/validators/algorithms?
1584 2018-04-04 20:45:19 GPU. Because if it is centralised private entity issued crypto we might as well go back to using centralised government issued fiat currency.

1593 2018-04-04 20:44:50 Crazy in my books. I'm all about crypto but imagine if "Bitcoin Bubble" is actually a thing/does burst.... So bad for branding. Plus there are WAY more exciting tokens out there crappy people can plagiarize lol 
1594 2018-04-04 20:44:46 Das erste mal Crypto-Miner im Browser laufen gehabt für eine Art Captcha. Irgendwie unangenehm
1595 2018-04-04 20:44:21 Does it have to do with crypto Chen, phil and the other guy?..
1596 2018-04-04 20:44:06 Rite now it’s time to bye!!!! Look at the time look at the dayte!!!! Look at the exploonasoon poynts!!!! Bitcoin is going to be 4444 tymes more vallyouable!!!! $btc #crypto $ltc $eth $doge

1599 2018-04-04 20:43:58 @Crypto4thepeeps Dude, love your channel. I have something crypto amazing you need to hear about. #HeadWillExplodeAmazing
1600 2018-04-04 20:43:54 I find your cultural insensitivity unbefitting for such a public ambassador to crypto. The Canadians have a hard enough time already, show a little compassion. Eh??
1601 2018-04-04 20:43:42 HEADLINES OF THE DAY

 Today, a little bit of a storm on the crypto-exchange Binance, users could not log into their accounts. The Exchange acknowledged a malfunction and reported a bug in the database.
1602 2018-04-04 20:43:36 Tech stocks have been epic today. There is life out there other than crypto. That is all.
1603 2018-04-04 20:43:28 Netscape was THE browser... and lets not forget AOL.
1604 2018-04-04 20:43:25 People keep forgetting how small crypto twitter is compared to the rest of the world ..........
1605 2018-04-04 20:43:21 Just one day left in #Thrive #publicsale #crypto

1607 2018-04-04 20:43:18 I bought it as well, just not as much as you
1608 2018-04-04 20:43:14 Your charts are beautiful sir
1609 2018-04-04 20:43:06 I am disappointed, I was expecting exotic picks, very small cap gems, stuffs I never heard of but I suppose my expectations were too high. Take cares !

1614 2018-04-04 20:42:08 Old? Haha
1615 2018-04-04 20:42:07 Crypto news website said something bullish about crypto. News at 11.

1620 2018-04-04 20:41:20 Exactly the greedy sort of people we are trying to get away from. 
Now the only thing we need freedom from is centralised exchanges who charge us more than banks for using our own money to invest in crypto.

1644 2018-04-04 20:38:12 I agree, Ripple handles transperancy and privacy very seriously and waits until both sides are ready to announce. @business seems to be writing a Ripple gossip piece. People tend to forget that Ripple (the company) is just a steward of xrp.

1653 2018-04-04 20:36:53 Keep reaching bro not a single fact from you,  debate style is weak and you are a waste of my time without providing any facts the $Pac team is front and center and Brad will be keynote speaker at London crypto show what more do you want him to do come to your house?
1654 2018-04-04 20:36:49 But that was clear. Reproducibility of crypto currencies. That's same like inflation. This inflation can just survive the product with real economic usecases.
If you brake this down, there are just a handful of possibilities.
1655 2018-04-04 20:36:46 Tiring to see #crypto twitter tryna shame certain bagholders & revel in IMPENDING FAILURE!!! Money's to be made at certain times w most coins, including $XVG, $TRX. You guys realize that $XVG tripled last 10 days, right? 3x. Ignore the noise. Stop loss to manage dump risk.
1656 2018-04-04 20:36:46 Actually it should reach top of h&s or other top bearish formation like Double/triple top
1657 2018-04-04 20:36:42 Not sure how I missed this one! Much appreciated. I'm excited now, don't ask me why :D Thank you for everything you have done and are doing for the crypto world.
1658 2018-04-04 20:36:33 Ice storm price goes higher you get less storm for the bolts but the app itself is a great way to earn crypto. I have like six hundred and eighty thousand volts if you play the games and do the apps it's totally worth it because one day storm is going to be worth a lot of money
1659 2018-04-04 20:36:30 So weird! It has been hacked! but Still going up 
1660 2018-04-04 20:36:13 You need to wait until 20 series come out the prices went so high cause of people mining crypto currency
1661 2018-04-04 20:36:02 Are you serious? Poor in Africa can't bank because they make too little income. Financial services overhead cannot work in those scenarios. Give them crypto they have a global reach. Could become an army of web devs or programmers easily. Many possibilities.

1665 2018-04-04 20:35:29 Troche przesadzają z tym podatkiem. Sami nie wiedzą jak ten temat "ugryźć". Zamiana krypto na Fiat i wypłata na konto bankowe - OK, ale podatek od zamiany jednej krypto na drugą . Poza tym w którym momencie masz wykazać przychód? Już, teraz? ............... A może teraz? 
1666 2018-04-04 20:35:26 Crypto is not a safe haven hahahahaha. Nothing further from it

1668 2018-04-04 20:35:24 Wasn’t easy at times!

That’s how much of a believer I am in this new, evolving #crypto market

So many caught up in #alts and are missing the greatest buying opportunity in the blue chips.

This is a mistake 

$BTC $ETH $LTC
1680 2018-04-04 20:34:02 The actually coin, XRP, is little more than a paycheck for those who pre-mined, oh, I mean, created it. Crypto is answering all the questions I had growing up like, how anyone could be fooled by such obvious scams as snake oil salesmen.
1681 2018-04-04 20:33:54 There are literal babies who have more money, crypto-wealth and social media clout than anyone I know. The old age:affluence scale has no use in this strange era.

1692 2018-04-04 20:32:23 Seems pretty clear the strategy is ban everyone and then allow those back who complain and are legit (assuming they allow anyone back at all). 

That’s what I’d do if I wanted to ban crypto.

I think this is the best way to pay back those MF and make them regret their bias!

1702 2018-04-04 20:31:26 If your are open for trading #crypto, it’s completely possible to make more money in this bear season than in a bull season. 

- buy/sell obvious short swings
- accumulate #alts by adding to their worth in #btc

It’s a formula that’s potentially parabolic. 

Not financial advice

1705 2018-04-04 20:31:02 For once your right XRP and all other "crypto" , including BTC, have failed being "currency".
That's why Ripple started building products for use cases wherein XRP serves as a part of a solution, not just "a solution"

1715 2018-04-04 20:29:39 I remember 2015, when XRP was never considered a token even nor ripple was considered a coin not by the investors neither by the banks. And the time came when XRP and Ripple proved everyone wrong. This is what "Crypto" is. #Unpredictable as those who are smart enough can get it

1724 2018-04-04 20:28:32 Likely harm crypto, given investors across the board tend to be more conservative, but nothing is conclusive.  Crypto-currency hasn't been around long enough to weather such a storm. However, volatility is unattractive when markets are unstable.

1729 2018-04-04 20:28:16 That's why I scalp every 5-7%  I  urge everyone to do the same. Protecting capital is the first rule for a trader.
1730 2018-04-04 20:28:15 I take it, you work in crypto now?
1731 2018-04-04 20:28:07 It’s not a security because the owner has no ownership in the business.  It is an asset, primarily “controlled” by Ripple.  However, anyone may own, use, or trade $XRP like any assets. The key determination must come through clearer regs that define the types of digital assets.

1744 2018-04-04 20:26:42 Sorry if I am gonna offend anyone but what makes Coinbase so great is the lack of patience and laziness of the Americans. Their customer service sucks, they overcharged people, they manipulated BCH price and stopped people from selling to keep prices up

1748 2018-04-04 20:26:24 @Ripplenews_tech Since Coinbase and Gemini both refused to add XRP, how about Ripple starting it's own exchange or financing an exchange that will use XRP as its main crypto?
1749 2018-04-04 20:26:20 haha, frustrating, I know. Is it possible that "they" are selling but don't want to make it obvious that it's them. I can't think of regular coiners selling to random FUD at this point unless they are brain dead.
1750 2018-04-04 20:26:12 Oh my God.  So many people get paid to shill crypto. 

And now when Ripple tried to enter additional market so many people act like it is a shame.

It's normal for companies to buy markets in some cases. 

Don't blame them for beeing a serious company.

1760 2018-04-04 20:24:45 Ripple has said many times that it has a war chest and intends to use it to improve their ecosystem so this news of them offering to pay comes as no surprise. Ripple has done great without either of them so I’m not worried.
1761 2018-04-04 20:24:31 Fiat will not be devalued by Crypto until crypto is used in a significant way as a currency. That has yet to happen. As long as it is only an asset, safe haven, and speculative instrument, fiat is safe. That being said, I feel 1 million is possible (on the high end)

1768 2018-04-04 20:23:42 $XRP doesn’t need to be “decentralized” since Ripple is a custodian, however, $XRP must not be considered a security. If all the XRP were in float, it would be easier for Ripple to claim the token is not a security, but an asset of value to move value.

1784 2018-04-04 20:22:04 In a typical startup environment, people have a scarcity of funds, hence they push with execution.

1785 2018-04-04 20:22:04 The log chart for the last 3 or so years keep me sane. I keep telling myself this drama will soon be a barely noticable blip relative to the next cycle.
1786 2018-04-04 20:22:02 No, I'm not dancing with mr. brownstone at all! XRP will fail as a crypto. You created bigger hype with you shitcoin than BTC ever did.
1787 2018-04-04 20:21:58 Failure is the best thing that can happen to you. If you experience it you will hate it so much, next time you will do everything to not fail again.

1788 2018-04-04 20:21:48 This is the lesson I learnt in January when Alts were at usd all time highs. When btc is super expensive and Alts start going 5x like they did in Jan, you have to look at usd even tho you cash out through btc. Once btc is low like currently the sole focus needs to be btc

1790 2018-04-04 20:21:45 The assumptions made are some far out there assumptions. Fiat declining does not guarantee crypto goes up.

1800 2018-04-04 20:21:13 It’s sounds like Coinbase and Gemini want more clarity on $xrp being a digital asset instead of a security. Coinbase and Gemini are just protecting themselves before moving forward. I’m sure both exchanges understand the amount of profit to be made listing xrp.

1813 2018-04-04 20:19:50 Google’s algorithm should be public and auditable on the blockchain.

If Youtube demonitizes a video, their decision should be auditable and on the public chain.

Twitter’s limiting of crypto accounts should be transparent to all its victims.
1814 2018-04-04 20:19:43 This not uncommon to other token.  The problem is, is XRP a security? If it is not, and the SEC declares that or regulation clarifies, acceptance to US exchanges will be easier.

1869 2018-04-04 20:13:42 I agree. They were exchanging there $BTC for $XRP , and now look at $XRP

1896 2018-04-04 20:11:52 Yep, not mentioning how much maturation most tools that intends to ease crypto implmentation for dApps still need. Repos are full of issues that only a few can handle. IMO i don't expect this path to be done before a few years

1901 2018-04-04 20:11:36 You're drawing a comparison to the guys selling information products on how to become rich. Crypto is more egregious, because these influencers invariably get free tokens as well. So they charge their fee, pump up the price, and then take advantage of the coin appreciation.

1907 2018-04-04 20:11:07 And a number of other instances. But you are free to have your opinion. I personally think his actions in the last year have damaged the crypto space, perhaps permanently, but end of the day I hope it can thrive again and have no issue with $BCH being a ship in that tide.
1908 2018-04-04 20:10:54 Do you still have faith in crypto? I bought your course and am not convinced. Feels like you bit off more than you could chew (telling participants to buy ZRX & DCR at all time highs cannot be seen as an informed move). Sure, think long term, but those are bad calls that lost $$$
1909 2018-04-04 20:10:54 #Bitcoin #BTC I think when it comes to Bitcoin we just have to stay patient right now. I know that’s hard for us in crypto... we do this for the volatility and excitement. I still think we hit minimum $30,000 by EOY.

1915 2018-04-04 20:10:12 Good riddance. This is the sort of thing that is holding back crypto from gaining mainstream adoption.

1966 2018-04-04 20:04:37 Noraa you missed the point of the tweet. Point is that there is no real diversification in crypto if all coins move the same way as Bitcoin. See graphs.

2003 2018-04-04 20:00:41 Ripple controls the biggest stake of xrp. Escrow does not change the fact that xrp token are owned by ripple. If xrp is decentralized crypto, you shouldn't be able to sell it to banks, financial companies etc. and make profit side by side selling other products (like xcurrent).

2016 2018-04-04 19:59:56 I could see Cardano do it once they start launching their projects. This would be funny as most crypto twitter OGs hate ADA for some reason even though Charles’ has his long game locked
2017 2018-04-04 19:59:51 You can trade most alts against ETH as well. Especially newer erc20 tokens only on dex's where trading against eth is the only option.
2018 2018-04-04 19:59:51 It's relative to your portfolio. Maybe for some 50$ and someone else 1000$ .
2019 2018-04-04 19:59:45 Making life changing profits in Crypto is simple, spot the trend, get in early, and hold until it develops. But actually doing this is hard, you have to believe your convictions, tune out the negativity, and Hold On!

2021 2018-04-04 19:59:42 If this is true, would this give alt coins more room to go up? We have an alt year instead of an alt season.
2022 2018-04-04 19:59:33 The sad part is that you know crypto is over all "new" to people, many many new investors, so how can you expect people to know that 1sat is not the lowest? It's like saying 1 penny is not the lowest, someone is selling at 1/4 penny. People did not know, but are blamed.

2045 2018-04-04 19:55:57 When I first got into crypto someone was telling me he has been buying silver and gold and putting it in his safe, it was his end game for wealth. Solid idea imo

2058 2018-04-04 19:53:59 That's a bit extreme, so I had to reply. Holding won't "kill" crypto, just like holding doesn't kill the stock market.

But using it IRL does help it become more widely accepted, and does help it grow, imho.

2060 2018-04-04 19:53:29 Who cares if XRP tried to bribe coinbase. I would too if a had a few billion to dump
2061 2018-04-04 19:53:27 I'd love to see a list of every crypto prediction @officialmcafee and other influencers have made in the last 12 months and whether they came true or not. I have a sneaking suspicion that follower counts don't correlate with accuracy.
2062 2018-04-04 19:53:24 Now let's see how the markets react to this news, specifically to see if XRP is affected just like companies' stocks would
2063 2018-04-04 19:53:12 Shouldn’t, China already banned crypto 10-12 times this year.

Seriously, I don’t think we will see much effect.  US-China are both puffing their chests.  In the end they will come to an agreement that allows both to claim victory without much changing on the trade front.

2071 2018-04-04 19:52:29 Crypto has a plethora of dreams but lack of execution runs rampant.
2072 2018-04-04 19:52:25 so true! what we did back then for a bit of attention. Id do it all over again if I had to choose again. So many loose band parties. 9 years? Thats awesome, good work. Keep the same dedication with crypto and partying and you will be set for the high life lol
2073 2018-04-04 19:52:24 Is Verge taking the lead on signaling alt season. Still waiting for your call on an “alt season”
2074 2018-04-04 19:52:20 Ripple, the Colin Kaepernick of crypto
2075 2018-04-04 19:52:20 Technically yes, but there is a obscure clause that he states COULD federalize the national guard, which basically would be equivalent to marshal law since they’d be on our soil still. But I doubt he’s read the National Security act of 1945.

2079 2018-04-04 19:51:15 why so important coinbase ?
2080 2018-04-04 19:51:14 Yes I think it’s a great idea. And they need to know that we are the soul marketing team. It’s not a crypto company that’s marketing adoption. We the investors do it in every day conversation, education, and investment
2081 2018-04-04 19:51:13 林檎さんの好きな誘われ方は？
2082 2018-04-04 19:51:00 With any #crypto where 1 or a few Devs have the ability to sabotage (deliberately or accidentally) the code or agenda one can argue the currency is centralised. This seems an Achilles heel.
2083 2018-04-04 19:50:59 I respectfully disagree with parts of this. We don’t know the future for either and would argue that as an investor, both would add value today...I think this does matter to many investors and we should challenge our company to find a way to make it happen.

2088 2018-04-04 19:50:17 Who knows. The whole crypto market seems like it’s being manipulated like the Gold and Silver markets.
2089 2018-04-04 19:50:16 There are two decisions in crypto:  1) being in crypto and in bitcoin (aka out of USD) 2) being in an alt coin ......  you can get one decision right while being wrong in the other.  Key point is even when you are in altcoins you are still doing decision 1 (in crypto/bitcoin)
2090 2018-04-04 19:50:15 When the social media platforms Goog, Fb, LinkedIn, Twitter emerged, Forrester Research called it the "#SPLINTERNET"... NEXT I think, is the "#INCENTIVENET", where users will be paid crypto-tokens (tradable digital 'loyalty points') in exchange for their personal data.

2106 2018-04-04 19:48:02 the key to success in crypto is to be very patient, and especially don't play a lot of money set you limits, it is better to enrich slowly, than to get poorer quickly, and never forget nobody lives in the moon..
2107 2018-04-04 19:47:56 The best thing about crypto twitter is that I don't have to physically be near any of you people
2108 2018-04-04 19:47:52 I'm not trying to destroy anything. I'm just trying to discuss things as they are. You can't understand that xrp will fail if ripple will not fix centralized model. It is not crypto. It shouldn't be listed on coinmarketcap at all!
2109 2018-04-04 19:47:49 Crypto needs self or private (competing) regulatory bodies. Once government (monopolized) regulators take control, the rules are written to favor of the highest bidder. This is when the common investors and traders lose.

2118 2018-04-04 19:47:00 its not about having 1 coin to dominate the entire cryptosphere, its about crypto gaining a grip in general. There is absolutely no logics in what you are saying. Without 'other' crypto, btc wouldnt be what it is today - you dont seem to understand much

#3. BTFDBOD That's. BUY THE FUCKING DEEP BLEEDING OUT DIPS.

2199 2018-04-04 19:37:24 Curious about @qurrex  ? It will be a way to use crypto in your everyday expenses and  purchases. Buying anything is difficult with crypto currently, but this  will change with  #ICO

2259 2018-04-04 19:29:15 nice article suchapp.
2260 2018-04-04 19:29:13 Makes more sense to trade against BTC in a bull market, in my opinion. If the alt outperforms BTC there, it's a killer. In a bear market, you want to enter from fiat, in order to reduce your risk. As, an alt can outperform BTC, but still lose fiat value due to BTC downside
2261 2018-04-04 19:29:09 Exchanges can add XVG whenever they want using GIThub. 

It simply increases availability for people to acquire #XVG

Some like the security of centralized exchanges.. Verge is all about freedom of choice which isn't acquired through limitations.

Also DeX are relatively new.
2262 2018-04-04 19:29:09 Which alts have an alt/fiat market a d which exchanges support them?  I’m talking other then coinbase?
2263 2018-04-04 19:28:54 Thanks!

1) As soon as you sell it will 100% explode higher, thanks!!

2) As soon as you sell, it may actually dump lower, since you own so much. We get much cheaper coins!!

3) See number 1

2271 2018-04-04 19:27:30 What is really curious to me is why the newer apps are choosing to take the route of not selling actual crypto but contracts or something else. 
What is motivating that?
2272 2018-04-04 19:27:21 Insider trading is a crime. Period. It is a small part of the reason crypto should welcome regulation with open arms. Just my two sats.

2274 2018-04-04 19:26:57 Buy more when it’s low. BTDD
2275 2018-04-04 19:26:41 I try explain it like this...BTC is the Crypto reserve currency,like $ is in the 'real' world. Using Monero as an example,it doesn't have a $ market cap at all,it currently has a market cap of 397,570 BTC. Always trade your alts vs BTC never V the $
2276 2018-04-04 19:26:39 I remember.  Getting old.
2277 2018-04-04 19:26:37 New investors are so weird.... they invest when everything is soaring high... but once it hits bottom, they don't invest anymore. Why invest when its green? Isn't a down market the best time to invest? #FoodForThought #cryptocurrency #crypto #investing #investor #TRX

2280 2018-04-04 19:26:26 Prefer to focus on Ethereum as it’s faster and fees are cheaper.
2281 2018-04-04 19:26:23 Well put - I concur entirely.
2282 2018-04-04 19:26:14 That’s why crypto.
2283 2018-04-04 19:26:09 Look at the chart, he even circled what he is referring to.

2304 2018-04-04 19:23:49 If your goal is to “cash out” you need to be considering both your trade in ALT/BTC and the BTC/USD trade.   The way to do this is cancel out the BTC and trade ALT—>USD theoretically. It’s a math equation.

2316 2018-04-04 19:22:16 That was my takeaway from their recent congressional testimony. It didn’t sound like they wanted anything to do with securities, but their willingness to list ERC20 tokens contradicts that. They can make the argument that Ethereum is commodity since it’s mineable, not a security
2317 2018-04-04 19:22:11 Why does it matter if trading BTC straight to fiat within 30 mins or so? If my alt is worth 30k it’s worth 30k regardless of the bitcoin price right?

2327 2018-04-04 19:20:24 Never said it doesn't matter.

The argument is that in most cases you'll be going alt--> BTC --> USD, so the focus should be on the BTC part (especially since that's the pair you'll most likely be trading too).
2328 2018-04-04 19:20:13 It's a shit coin and a pump scam, everyone knows that.
2329 2018-04-04 19:20:11 Only matters when you cash out and buy in with fiat. otherwise its all relative to btc value.
2330 2018-04-04 19:20:03 Another thing people don’t consider: the next recession has already started to move in. There are currently around 250 trillion dollars being tied up in equity’s and stock markets world wide. Just 2% of that following into crypto creates a 5 trillion market cap. Aka million$+ btc

2396 2018-04-04 19:11:26 Slowly but surely i understand why Twitter and others are banning crypto. This official Verge thread is FULL of scams and amazingly i myself fall just victim to it sending some damn ether to one of these scams as it looked legit to offer some compensation after the hash attack.
2397 2018-04-04 19:11:13 remember when people actually bought crypto dips....good times

2399 2018-04-04 19:11:10 Strong fundamental coins with a nice following/hype.  However, a 50x depends on the condition of the market as a whole and more importantly depends on your entry and exit. Crypto had an insane run for over 2 years. It wouldn’t be unreasonable for an extended bear trend.
2400 2018-04-04 19:11:00 Long ALT/BTC then hedge with BTC/USD short to protect capital in a bear market.

2440 2018-04-04 19:04:56 @ProfFaustus why so arrogant on maths that non-core academics seem to prove you wrong on?

Why exaggerate/be arrogant? Be modest & let the power of big blocks/no-RBF/op-codes speak for itself.

2442 2018-04-04 19:04:44 Useful coins don’t need to lobby for inclusion. #XRP is not useful. It’s only use it ripping off new crypto investors because they don’t know what they’re doing. Ripple the company could have a use but owning the token is just dumb. Lots of people gonna lose b/c of XRP.

2477 2018-04-04 19:01:10 The BTC superfans have been pretty successful in spreading a lot of FUD and misinformation claiming xrp is centralized and all that load. I would say that even some smart people that know a thing or two about crypto still believe xrpl is centralized.

2533 2018-04-04 18:54:54 Bitcoin security is derived from the block reward - a traditional crypto economic incentive.  I think it's all about making it more profitable to contribute, than to attack.
2534 2018-04-04 18:54:53 I signed up to Kucoin yesterday... mulled DRGN over but didn’t pull the trigger! Need to look for a better entry now...
2535 2018-04-04 18:54:52 it defeats the purpose of crypto currency because, its not a stock exchange lmfao. its a decentralized currency that holds actual value. people literally use this as money,
2536 2018-04-04 18:54:46 Haha - this is great... I'll always respond to you! ; p (side note: I also check the legitimacy of the crypto companies I represent)
2537 2018-04-04 18:54:38 The same happened to me now. Their computer called me with an unlock code... just wish a real life person would have called me so I could say what I have to say 
2538 2018-04-04 18:54:34 Nobody will eat me up. I have zero emotional attachment to crypto. I buy and HODL Litecoin. I do not swing trade or sell.

2550 2018-04-04 18:53:07 No other alt coin should be allowed to use the Bitcoin name. Only in Crypto is something like this allowed.

Welcome to giiiirlzooone 
2559 2018-04-04 18:52:36 This guy is a goon! I bet you he was wants BCash being used by everyone in the world, not to save babies(can’t believe he even said that..troll), but because he has massive bags of BCash. This guy can’t even be serious and professional
2560 2018-04-04 18:52:30 its available. I was looking into it but it's the dumbest idea I've ever seen. From what I see, they're not a authorized crypto exchange, so it looks like they're using other crypto exchanges (3rd party), hence why you don't have a crypto wallet on robinhood.
2561 2018-04-04 18:52:26 So my friend @coin_artist got me into crypto about a year ago! We were roommates when she painted her famous crypto puzzle that was all over the news last year!
2562 2018-04-04 18:52:19 私もさっき見てきました。本当すごいですw
2563 2018-04-04 18:52:16 Cant be right.. You're not thats sweet
2564 2018-04-04 18:52:16 September #crypto down seemed more pleasing than this one. Already 25% of this year has passed and we are down by more than 70%. $BTC $XRP $ETH $LTC. Its better to fill your needs rather than feeding your greed. It is said being patient is the key to ones success.
2565 2018-04-04 18:52:06 crypto ??
2566 2018-04-04 18:51:55 @tk88one its junk, just like the past two smart contracts the same developers wrote that somehow got "hacked".
2567 2018-04-04 18:51:51 Wie see it coming ..

2568 2018-04-04 18:51:46 It’s fantastic.  I use it almost every day.
2569 2018-04-04 18:51:44 Well that escalated quickly 
2570 2018-04-04 18:51:31 I read about that. I don’t buy it. Scared investors are dumping. We haven’t seen a pump all year.
2571 2018-04-04 18:51:27 And What US Exchanges Can We Margin Trade On Lol

2577 2018-04-04 18:50:49 hey debo not in the crypto currency out of ur virtual shorts
2578 2018-04-04 18:50:37 I don’t think people will ever stop using crypto purely for speculation. Even in the fx market, only 1% of the all the volume results in real transactions.

2587 2018-04-04 18:50:01 Of all crypto assets #XRP actually has a use case. Fear of regulation has hit the whole cryptosphere, and those that rightfully should be fearful (unusable ICOs/ERC20 tokens …) drags usable assets, such as XRP, down with it.

2590 2018-04-04 18:49:50 Its funny to think about. What was the real reason of NOV DEC JAN bullrun? It wasn't adoption. More about FOMO IMO
2591 2018-04-04 18:49:48 Bitcoin Core is losing merchants every day whereas Bitcoin Cash is gaining new ones. The trend is clear. Just give it some time and BCH will dominate crypto.

2593 2018-04-04 18:49:41 I'm an optimist when it comes to the opportunity here in crypto but I've also seen first hand how fast the tides cant turn if you just buy the hype. This is real money, in a maturing (but still new) market, and the shills need to mature with the investors in the space.

If/when crypto shifts back into a bull market and runs up, I may convert some profit into silver (and a little gold). Been a long 7 years for PMs with manipulation of price in force

2613 2018-04-04 18:47:51 The thing is, if you argue, and it seems that you really do, that XRP is decentralized better than any shitcoin crypto, including BTC, ripple company trying to create hype through listings on exchanges that shouldn't matter to ripple at all.

2615 2018-04-04 18:47:40 Same.
2616 2018-04-04 18:47:33 Because mainstream companies haven’t started paying employees in crypto, yet. We are a long way from that, at least as far as your D*** is concerned . I do hope you’re correct, though!

If it was the value prop of blockchain you get a reminder of why you were attracted in the first place. Ideally both & you are smarter + more committed

ive spent lots of time in 3rd world and every fuckin body has a phone and knows how to use it, and nobody has a bank or any way of securing funds
2679 2018-04-04 18:42:17 IDK what data is floating out in the universe that indicates to crypto people that I might be interested in that, but let me assure you: I am not.
2680 2018-04-04 18:42:04 What has happened with #cryptocurrency since mid December 2017 is exactly why you shouldn't have liquidated many of your other investments or assets & chased crypto currency prices higher. But, many people ignored the warnings & did it anyways
2681 2018-04-04 18:41:57 Sounds like an ambitious undertaking.  Move to Puerto Rico and you immediately increase your gains by 20% without the hassle of the LLC. 
2682 2018-04-04 18:41:50 yeaaaay jeg fikk en alliert!!! 
2683 2018-04-04 18:41:42 New post in Crypto Growth Network: HEADLINES OF THE DAY

 Today, a little bit of a storm on the crypto-exchange Binance, users could not log into their accounts. The Exchange acknowledged a malfunction and reported a bug in the database. At this point,…

2687 2018-04-04 18:41:24 The next phase of $XVG's growth, massive scale real world use, will put #Verge at the forefront of #cryptocurrency, drive up demand, and will keep more #XVG off the sell side of the order book(as it will be in use).
Naysayers who say #crypto isn't #currency will look stupid. #XVG
2688 2018-04-04 18:41:18 just store btc and wait it out. it's gonna eventually go higher. if no one buys or sells, whales don't have no one to dump on. is this viable?
2689 2018-04-04 18:41:15 My bank is my $crypto wallett
2690 2018-04-04 18:41:04 All of the crypto businesses in this space were started by holders of Bitcoin and then Ethereum who took HUGE risks and will obviously do whatever it takes to protect those investments.
XRP never developed an ecosystem outside of Ripple.
2691 2018-04-04 18:41:00 Suggest adding some bags of popcorn. 
2692 2018-04-04 18:40:52 If there's one problem with crypto, it's certainly not the technology itself. I believe far too many people who are into cryptocurrency are either in for the wrong reasons or don't have adequate knowledge to be trading. DYOR. Simple. Waaay too many so-called experts on Twitter

2694 2018-04-04 18:40:47 @GeminiDotCom raised fee's for many people 4x. I used to recommend them to new people just entering crypto but will actually be advising the exact opposite. Despicable and sleazy move @GeminiDotCom

2705 2018-04-04 18:40:03 McAfee: First time I've quoted my own tweet, but here goes - Wake up just enough to perceive this obvious truism: as crypto moves in, Fiat is devalued. As Fiat is devalued, inflation sets in. Not one person has talked about this yet. Strange don't you think?
2706 2018-04-04 18:40:00 Yeah, I hear ya, but it's also worth noting that uploading a list that hasn't been previously opted in to MailChimp technically violates their terms of use, so they'd have that covered anyway. I don't think it was an anti crypto move, but more just an overreaction (IMO).
2707 2018-04-04 18:39:58 So $ctr gets blasted with some pretty legit bad news..i read it from my horses mouth (Binance).yet it blows the fuck up. Maybe i missed something aside from the train.

2709 2018-04-04 18:39:42 $XRP isn’t a currency. Look into what they are actually solving, it’s a no brainer.
2710 2018-04-04 18:39:39 Why not?  Maybe there should be Crypto REITS that only invest in digital/crypto mortgages and digital/crypto strip malls, health care facilities, apartments, etc.  No physical land or assets. Just crypto land that is created from the block chain.
2711 2018-04-04 18:39:34 "Most people" aren't trained economists — even if they are, it's excessively likely they were educated under the Keynesian model.  It's no wonder so few can see what's actually happening in crypto!

Fortunately, "crypto" is rooted in a robust history of autonomy and independence.

2734 2018-04-04 18:37:17 Every time I ask someone what Bitcoin is, they respond “oh ya know, it’s crypto-currency!”  Like I’m supposed to know what that means?  Nerds
2735 2018-04-04 18:37:08 Crypto currency mining; it takes an enormous amount of PC's running at once to successfully stay online 24/7... And lots of good gpus. Therefore the price hikes in gpus

2741 2018-04-04 18:36:12 Not fake news.  Market research.  You've learned that there is a HUGE market for a long/short crypto ETF!
2742 2018-04-04 18:36:11 No one wants it at that price, so sellers have to lower their price to sell. Which is what moves bitcoin's price down. Bitcoins price is just the point where buyers and sellers trade at. Bitcoins price is just a moving point in time where buyers and sellers agree to meet.

2744 2018-04-04 18:35:58 As long as they put in a request with the United States government like they did before they found out what crypto was and try to run their country properly their should not be anything illegal there doing.  Someone knows about it.  More importantly the United States knows.
2745 2018-04-04 18:35:51 Not really in my opinion, central banks are just change fiat into a ponzi. As i often said, dollars&co is the bubble. Crypto will eat this shit fiat, and it's a good thing for a shine futur. ( soz for my english i do my best   )

2840 2018-04-04 18:24:39 People just don't get that. Fiat has an unlimited supply. It's worth nothing. Crypto has a limited supply. With the gold backed Yuan followed by the Gold/Silver backed dollar. People will leap out of USD. If they wait, the exchange rate isn't in their favor. Ride the crypto.

2871 2018-04-04 18:21:32 Yeees, in my head 
2872 2018-04-04 18:21:31 If the goal is raising capital from nonaccredited investors, in addition to Reg A (which I agree is not built well for crypto), Reg CF for offerings up to $1M & Rule 504 SCOR Offerings for up to $5M are viable options to consider. Also Tier 1 Reg A (up to $20M) is an easier path.

2886 2018-04-04 18:19:55 Is it a good time to invest in ICO?
The market is red, but successful ICOs will have a good chance of tanking with the next positive market correction. Buying into an ICO is an investment into a company more than into a currency. What are you investing into?

2891 2018-04-04 18:19:34 Most definitely they would tank initially, like almost all other assets. Eventually people would figure out that some crypto project are a good store of value.
2892 2018-04-04 18:19:27 Crypto down another 10%.....shocker
2893 2018-04-04 18:19:15 ''Hullo!'' said Pippin, poking his head round the curtain.  ''Are you one of those crypto influencers?''

2895 2018-04-04 18:19:10 so Im confused. If the sell wall on the red gets filled then how does that show few buyers? As I understand the depth chart the green and red sides want to pull the price in their direction. so a wall is a hurdle the price needs to go over to continue the direction?
2896 2018-04-04 18:19:03 and $XRP didn’t go from 3.5 to 0.50 because of $XRP itself. If you believe that than I suggest you do some research.
2897 2018-04-04 18:18:56 Do #cryptoeconomics-based consensus mechanisms claim to be secure against attacks by states or terrorist orgs? If so, what is the basis of the claim? (I am skeptical that economic incentives cover the field of human motivations.)

2964 2018-04-04 18:11:59 I will say that I hope its partnership is serious and causes a mass upset in the crypto world.  There are some #shitcoinanomalies that will redeem themselves over the next few years.  It's going to be funny.

2980 2018-04-04 18:10:49 Decentralized means that there is no set value... the community or in this case the ICO participants set the price based on what they list it for sale for. 

The price will be whatever the lowest seller is willing to take.

2983 2018-04-04 18:10:35 Your thoughts? I think Currency coin should be looked at as currency, not a commodity. The Fed Reserve is a private organization and $ is born from debt, yet no tax write off from depreciation allowed. Sure tax trades, but exempt crypto real item purchases from capital gains!

3031 2018-04-04 18:05:29 Thank you for sharing. You're totally correct. I should have been aware of this earlier. I am relieved to see the coins I'm in the largest down on the bottom end of the scale. Still, 50-60% is a lot of control though.
3032 2018-04-04 18:05:20 I see page-topping posts at r/cryptocurrency like:

"We need to de-couple BTC from the rest of crypto! It's ridiculous that all alts dump when BTC does!"

So all those upvoters no longer hold any BTC, right? To send the appropriate market signals for their preferences ... RIGHT?
3033 2018-04-04 18:05:17 Progress? Network stats and Team announcements are not really showing any progress at all. For a Token that wants to make Crypto and mining easy, and mass adoption they are not really making a good job...
3034 2018-04-04 18:05:16 Every time i check in on a crypto telegram group i hear the same thing. "yes, it's down, but Bitcoin is down." Why doesn't someone out there do something independent of friggin Bitcoin ?

Bah humbug
3035 2018-04-04 18:05:11 After a 3-month downward trend, I decided to officially turn #bearish on #crypto. I will not watch the markets, trade, or post about #crypto. However, I will keep my funds in and silently #HODL. I will re-assess in a month whether the markets finally behave logically again.
3036 2018-04-04 18:05:07 Just about to build a proper comp, would be a pleasure to be a proud owner of this one, Thanks for the chance !
3037 2018-04-04 18:05:05 Crypto as currency is far fetched, I don't see it happening. However, that was just an initial use case. The community has developed a lot ever since. There are now more better and realistic use cases of cryptos in the market.

One that I have thought about tho is that we do have 1 advantage over stocks.  Since crypto is considered personal property we are not subject to wash sale rules. Do you agree
3062 2018-04-04 18:03:17 Crypto  in general is a great opportunity for people excluded from the banking  system. Africa is one of those places. Good thinking.

3065 2018-04-04 18:03:01 Therefore, the (presently) rather light regulatory climate on crypto in most of Africa may have made the continent an attractive option for firms and startups who are looking to avoid extensive bureaucratic measures and regulatory rigamarole.

3112 2018-04-04 17:58:50 Then why is there so much FUD in the market? 
Why are many banks not allowing crypto transactions?
Why is the mainstream media trying to suppress prices? 
Why do banks feel threatened?
These questions are putting new Investors in doubt..... correct me if I am wrong......
3113 2018-04-04 17:58:43 Easier said than done. The barrier to entry for crypto start ups is getting higher. Flashy team, design, legal, exchange fees. Noob on ramping costs money.

3121 2018-04-04 17:57:16 Ya even I have this doubt. The later point you made and also governments will never agree to legalize it. What will be the fiscal and monetary policies, how will all this be regulated, people say crypto will exist with other currencies like dollar etc. which I don't buy
3122 2018-04-04 17:57:08 report this shit, these fake accounts are just a cancer for crypto.
3123 2018-04-04 17:56:58 Your are right, BitCoin, LiteCoin etc being used as a Legal Tender is far fetched. Crypto as a legal tender is just one use case of Block Chain. For ex, Ripple helps banks in financial transaction, FINA Coin helps in airline transaction, Ethereum has smart contracts etc.
3124 2018-04-04 17:56:54 @aelfblockchain go team!  Go crypto!
3125 2018-04-04 17:56:54 yes, I've heard about the atomic swaps, m holding a bag.

3128 2018-04-04 17:56:29 If nothing else, crypto has pushed people into thinking about their finances with a distinct sense of empowerment. A feeling they’ve probably never felt before – to think in real terms about achieving financial freedom.
3129 2018-04-04 17:56:28 We have a speaker coming to class next week to talk about crypto. Finance is dead.

3142 2018-04-04 17:54:25 The protocol records transactions on the
blockchain that attest a user’s contribution to
the network (by consumption, or by curation
and creation) and a smart contract distributes
CRNC tokens in response to that contribution.

3144 2018-04-04 17:54:14 I'm sceptical about crypto as a currency. Hell, given its volatility, Steam dropped Bitcoin payments altogether.
Nevertheless, each crypto tries to fill a specific purpose or fill gaps the others missed. Maybe there'll be an acceptable, unique crypto with miniscule shortcomings.

I'm very leery of people talking about it like crypto is a type of investment-vehicle.  And so is SEC, for that matter.

3181 2018-04-04 17:51:30 Solid strategy. I will use it three of his follows from now
3182 2018-04-04 17:51:26 "it appeared to be countercyclical then it became very pro-cyclical"

Shorter: "it isn't/wasn't either".

I think its premature to even think about "it" (just btc? all crypto?) in monolithic terms, much less start ascribing MPT asset-class behavior to nascent technologies.

3187 2018-04-04 17:51:07 so what does the token itself do?
3188 2018-04-04 17:51:01 Crypto people love to make shit complicated.

Use our decentralized platform!! BUT WAIT

To use the decentralized platform you need tokens.*

*You need to buy our token in a ratchet sketchy exchange that has no liquidity.

3222 2018-04-04 17:48:41 Its birb
Cant see any birDs
3223 2018-04-04 17:48:36 Correct. 

Weird. Does it not provide any confirmation? Tried with Brave and Firefox
3224 2018-04-04 17:48:33 #DGB is good coin, sure. But personally to @dbndude1, you need to promote your coin all over the world but not spread FUD to another's great crypto project. I know you hate all coins but your work can looks better if you'll work to bring #DGB to masses with payment functions
3225 2018-04-04 17:48:30 So far, a little less than a month ago alt season began. That could always change.
3226 2018-04-04 17:48:28 Haven't you been banned from any crypto conference yet?
3227 2018-04-04 17:48:27 #vinchain #vin #vehicle #blockchain #crypto #ico Excellent company! I advise everyone to join, this company will definitely bring profit in the future. Good luck to you!

3241 2018-04-04 17:47:35 so what does the token itself do?
3242 2018-04-04 17:47:30 @CryptoJebb hey. Please reach out to me. Would love to talk crypto!

3248 2018-04-04 17:46:34 Crypto is losing mainstream attention.
3249 2018-04-04 17:46:32 Is this a confirmation on Bitcoin acceptance?
3250 2018-04-04 17:46:30 The hardest part with crypto keys is that the general public loses/forgets things. Who handles revocation and re-issuance?
3251 2018-04-04 17:46:30 #vinchain #vin #vehicle #blockchain #crypto #ico Very interesting project I like it very much!!!Good luck and success in the future
3252 2018-04-04 17:46:29 Yeah.... you probably should also look at all the scams in crypto land.
3253 2018-04-04 17:46:27 The Dood's been preaching the $NXT, $ARDR, $IGNIS gospel almost since the beginning. Love this project!
3254 2018-04-04 17:46:27 Trading crypto on @RobinhoodApp feels extra imaginary due to not being able to withdraw it. I presume it's coming eventually but for the moment feels amusingly antithetical to the currency part of crypto currency
3255 2018-04-04 17:46:25 Step 1. Buy top. Step 2. Sell bottom. Step 3. Lambo.

So important to cover all markets. I mean Gold is up and we have specific crypts that run parallel with markets like that. Please start discussing all angles. You could be the first.
3279 2018-04-04 17:44:18 Actually @rogerkver is absolutely right with this statement. If you don’t think so, That’s probably why you support BTC! Well said Roger!

3281 2018-04-04 17:44:07 In my eyes, Bitcoin will go down much more! But it’s not the end... i think something else will replace Bitcoin and Bitcoin will go to the 2th place. What will happen?

3298 2018-04-04 17:41:15 wait you dont understand how this works? when ppl sell everyone makes profit from 10% of the sell. if the "creators sell" everyone wins? or did you not even take 5minutes to read the sourcecode and check the math for yourself?... take a look at it let me know what you think.
3299 2018-04-04 17:40:53 Because i saw only you, bankxrp, and tiff who fought the fudsters.. maybe there are others but i didnt notice.. sorry 
3300 2018-04-04 17:40:53 Price crashes are healthy for bitcoin. Psychologically this is challenging. Parabolic growth always eventually decelerates and 'crashes' in order for the market to correct for the next cycle. #bitcoin $crypto
3301 2018-04-04 17:40:45 Ok, the After Party in Florida then. My house, free drinks and I'll bake a BIG lasagna!
3302 2018-04-04 17:40:45 The real problem with tokens are that many are for "stock" that would normally not be allowed to be sold. You still need some kind of oversight to say yes this token represents something = to stock and no that token is just a crypto token (not a stock) with those associated risks
3303 2018-04-04 17:40:42 That’s 30k ?

Constant exaggeration.
Business and projects in general are like life - nothing is always "super" or "very good". If the devs always speak in an exaggerated manner, they might try to conceal shortcommings or try to lull in the gullible.

5. Value investing is the way forward in this market. After thorough research when you pick a Coin/Token, Buy and Stay invested.

6. As they say in Crypto World - If you can’t digest a downside of 50-60%, you don’t deserve an upside of 200-300% on your investment.

1. Cryptocurrencies are here to stay. Some Coins/Tokens may go down, new ones will emerge.

2. Crypto Market is a mess with more than 1500 Cryptos listed on CMC. You have a Coin/Token to facilitate literally everything that you can think of, many more are getting added.
3375 2018-04-04 17:35:06 IOST is a gem. I'm very bullish on this project for sustained long term growth. The market cap is already pretty high but I see this moving quickly up the crypto asset ranks to maybe top 10 or 15 within a few months
3376 2018-04-04 17:35:05 
3377 2018-04-04 17:34:49 When people start to use Abra, once Litecoin is moved in as the primary asset replacing Bitcoin, does that mean that Abra will need to hold the equivalent supply of Litecoin to equal the amount invested by retail consumers that are purchasing crypto via smart contracts? Thoughts?

3380 2018-04-04 17:34:40 Agreed....Mr Crypto...Get her ON THE MAP
3381 2018-04-04 17:34:24 lol.  I had no idea.

fwiw i'm very pro-crypto, as a technology.  I think it will have huge + beneficial impact on wide variety of things.

As an asset manager, I'm familiar with R2 issues.  It significance relies on 'over how much time'; crypto doesn't have much of that.
3382 2018-04-04 17:34:17 I have an asparagus bed. I takes some room and about 3 years to produce but once established its the easiest most automatic thing in my garden. Always the first harvest of the year. In a few weeks there will be shoots coming up like crazy.

3384 2018-04-04 17:33:53 I love this humbling tweets! Whenever I make few profitable trades I get too excited and may make a mistake, so reading this makes me realise the risk to trading especially crypto trading!
3385 2018-04-04 17:33:44 I just keep buying more. $DRGN going to moon so hard watch.

3391 2018-04-04 17:33:32 #GBCoin #Crypto #ICO #cryptocurrency #blockchain This platform could be the solution to many problems! The solution in the technology of blocking!
3392 2018-04-04 17:33:31 Any other time zone would have been just as arbitrary. Since all reasonably experienced crypto traders know when the candle closes, it has significance. These things are only snapshots of daily activity anyway, which is why you need to watch smaller and larger timeframes too
3393 2018-04-04 17:33:27 I-I don't identify with this at all
3394 2018-04-04 17:33:25 Ahh... I was following you thinking a chick... Gutted 
3395 2018-04-04 17:33:23 I hate selling though, I wish if there would be an easier way to short crypto, that's why I'm working on creating decentralized derivatives protocol with my friends, riding these waves is too risky, we need a proper way to hedge 
3396 2018-04-04 17:33:23 I had a dream

That the stock market went to shit and everybody moved on to crypto...
3397 2018-04-04 17:33:19 I’m gonna qoute this next time someone says my crypto investment was a bad choice
3398 2018-04-04 17:33:18 It sure is
3399 2018-04-04 17:33:18 Decided to stay off Reddit for a few weeks for the sake of my mental health. Similar to watching the news, only bad things come from too much information you have no power to change. I can look at the /crypto news 3 times a day, in case of crashes.
3400 2018-04-04 17:33:16 May be we will see one more drop of bitcoin going 6.0- 6.4k , then slowly retrace level and after 20th April be ready to go 9.0-10K !! Summer is gonna be HOT guys, be ready !!! #BTC #XVG #TRX #cryptocurrency #Bitcointalk #Crypto #bitcoins

3402 2018-04-04 17:32:49 I do agreed with everything you are saying, Gold and Silver are always the best store of values since ancient times. But right now it is not crazy to think some of that money will flow to crypto. Stock Market is more than 7trillion dollars worth just put 1 trillion in crypto.
3403 2018-04-04 17:32:42 I spelt it wrong on purpose... I am narrowing you down Dr T. 
3404 2018-04-04 17:32:39 Is it possible that this trade war shit and plummiting stocks push investors into metals?

3417 2018-04-04 17:31:15 Everything is on a public block chain so unless privacy coins are being used, it would be foolhardy to use crypto for money laundering, tax evasion slightly more concerning because there is so little reporting from exchanges

3463 2018-04-04 17:26:30 side point, it doesn't bode well for Crypto formidability (in reality or perception, which helps create former) if a single company's refusal to co-op could have "damning" effects.

3502 2018-04-04 17:20:52 ETH was my first crypto buy so I always have a soft spot for it. It’s been sad seeing it decline to the extent it has but when it truly starts popping again it should rip hard. Can’t wait.

3504 2018-04-04 17:20:46 2/ Mailchimp is obviously innovative as a co, so they probably have reasons that aren't public. what those are, only speculation, but i don't think this was some anti-crypto impulse. they probably have data. they have a data driven blog after all

3638 2018-04-04 17:08:00 With Crypto Trading, You Can’t Go Broke Cashing In Gains.

If you’re worried about cashing in profits early, don’t. You can’t go broke taking profits, so it's never a bad idea to cash out.

3771 2018-04-04 16:55:32 We don't need existing metal buyers to buy a ton of crypto. We just need young people who were never into metals to buy Bitcoin.

3778 2018-04-04 16:54:44 I would say that is a good thing.  Bitcoin isn't really an asset at all. It's a ditributed ledger. It works as a medium of exchange but it has no intrinsic value as an investment. Crypto wasn't meant to become an arbitrage opportunity for investors.

3803 2018-04-04 16:51:59 Because he has trump, i suspect he isnt american 
3804 2018-04-04 16:51:56 Then blames on Twitter personalities.

3807 2018-04-04 16:51:41 Pq um liberal é contra um moeda que pretende tirar a influência dos BCs sobre a economia. Mesmo discordando de ser um investimento ou não, eu não entendo ser um hater.

3809 2018-04-04 16:51:39 Lets see how much will XZC dump after this "CMC bug". I am not happy for such a good coin to be involved in schemes like that tho.

3813 2018-04-04 16:51:10 Does anybody know why I would get a : "Warning! Error encountered during contract execution [Reverted]" on an #ethereum contract? Enough gas was used. #contracts #eth $eth #blockchain #FAIL #crypto

3815 2018-04-04 16:51:07 The better question would be: When do you sell your crypto’s? 1. Btc under 6000$ 2. Btc under 5000$ 3. Btc under 4000$
Then we would know what the biggest resistance is 
3816 2018-04-04 16:51:03 I always thought he was American with having trump as his picture lol
3817 2018-04-04 16:50:55 $COFI is definitely underrated. Has the capacity, tools, & data to be the next Bloomberg of crypto.

4171 2018-04-04 16:15:49 Buy some $DRGN (Dragonchain). It's a crypto that will be worth 10-100x in the next 2 years. It's currently at a super low price at 71 cents. It will definitely reach $10-20 in the next year, and it can possibly reach $50-100 in a few years. Think of it as ETH for businesses.

4184 2018-04-04 16:14:39 That has been my preferred method for 10 years in traditional markets. Running into issues with crypto because most of my alerts trigger when I’m sleeping, any thoughts or solutions you might have found helpful ?

4188 2018-04-04 16:13:31 Nothing changed.
As long as BTC stays in the 6K to 9K range, bears are in control.

I have some buy orders waiting:
$ETH 350
$NEO 40
$BTC 5850

The rest of my bags are staying put. 
Good chances for Alts to go against the trend and shoot up.

We will see until Friday.

4193 2018-04-04 16:12:37 Hmmm, Just when I was figuring out crypto currency and blockchain concepts.
4194 2018-04-04 16:12:21 So stupid you have to pay sales tax on Silver purchases under $1500 here, other wise I would be buying ounces all the time.
4195 2018-04-04 16:12:19 Its so comical how you always try to punt crypto by knocking “traditional”, breaking down the other does not make your perceived value of something legitamite.
4196 2018-04-04 16:12:19 The people running crypto HF's are the wrong people. Hedge Funds are supposed to be hedged....

The table I created above is mathematically how the token issuing and TRX burning will scale. It's not a theory or speculation it is fact, and there is no hype or timeline.
It is based on new 'coins' created, not new currencies.

4214 2018-04-04 16:10:40 lol Funny how there wasn't a Bitcoin is rising post, but I know you guys love when bearish signs pop up.  Try looking at the year chart and see if you can post about "Bitcoin is falling" that way? Probably not right.
4215 2018-04-04 16:10:37 
4216 2018-04-04 16:10:30 Nailing down the specific language of the risk factors so that it was accurate and not what the crypto industry wants people to think.

4231 2018-04-04 16:08:53 #bitcoin its not discriminating, its neutral, it doesn't care, its 'dumb'...and that's why we love it. Bitcoin is a 'dumb' network that allows smart devices on.

4232 2018-04-04 16:08:47 It is understandable that you feel that way

It is an alt-right strategy to gaslight & muddy the water with crypto-fascism making everyone suspicious of dog-whistles and misattribute racism where there sometimes is none. I'm always careful of calling people racist for this reason

4236 2018-04-04 16:08:06 Funds to invest inc crypto are limited. Think in terms of a large asset manager looking for diversified exposure. A PM investing now in crypto would likely allocate 50% to BTC. If BCH would not exist the % allocated to BTC would be higher.

4359 2018-04-04 15:58:10 Regulatory bodies have limited resources & crypto is in addition to everything else they already cover. When crypto specific reg bodies are created, even those will not have the resources to keep up w/ potentially infinite cryptoasset creation if they don’t scale. RegTech needed.

4379 2018-04-04 15:55:47 It is not for the bitcoin crowd. Yet for a new investor who sees crypto in terms of digital assets a major fork results in having another asset to allocate funds to. Can think similarly about the avg user who does not care about crypto politics.  Forks diminishes demand for BTC.
4380 2018-04-04 15:55:27 @cz_binance I suppose $ctr mania currently going on on Binance is a glimpse of why the crypto market gets a poor reputation that is well deserved for its own good. Watching fireworks here just before everything goes dead silent.

4389 2018-04-04 15:54:24 Crypto hedge funds will be big in 5 years and possibly sooner.  Too much capital and not enough good projects to make that capital work in the short run.  Also, not enough products available to short the bad projects.  Security token Funds could get bigger in the short run.

Crypto is the largest contributor of sales and still not ltm profitable. Miners have over saturated the market and new coin specific ASICs made by new entrants don't bode well for them either.

4593 2018-04-04 15:34:39 How to hype crypto project.

Level 1. Noob - Announce partnership with existing big company. It doesn´t matter if that company knows about it.

4609 2018-04-04 15:32:19 I'm never sure of anything in #crypto but there are risks I take and ones I don't.  I hope it rages hard and makes you a lot of money, and if it does you will get a big fat public thumbs up from me.
4610 2018-04-04 15:32:17 The "crypto hedge fund" never made sense for the asset class, but LPs had FOMO and GPs were greedy or didn't know better. Feels like the market may finally be waking up to this, and the space will ultimately be better off for it
4611 2018-04-04 15:32:09 Volatility is a great problem in the Crypto Space. I believe in cryptocurrencies as a way to inovative services but volatility is not good

4614 2018-04-04 15:31:46 I appreciate your effort giving this an unbiased review. But I disagree with the rating. Schemes like this give crypto a bad name and should be discarded by serious people. It's not al about financial gain.
4615 2018-04-04 15:31:44 WHEN the stock market crashes that money will flow into cryptos and mass adoption will take place  starting this year. Litecoin will be the crypto that will be used as an everyday transaction bitcoin is a store of value. Litecoin at $120 is a gift

4620 2018-04-04 15:31:08 Current price of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and Ethereum does not properly represent the demand towards the market from investors in the public market, as seen in the case of Monex-Coincheck acquisition plans.

Hence, why I'm optimistic in the mid to long-term trend of crypto.

4747 2018-04-04 15:18:31 The crypto market is just taking the piss. Somebody is seriously messing with it. I remember well Jim Kramer on CNN saying that the moment the Chicago futures exchange kicks off with cryptos the big boys will “put the kybosh” on the market. Did he see it first?

4757 2018-04-04 15:17:45 $crypto is dot com circa 1988, not 1998 as people say. 
The difference is, due to the speed of tech now it won't take 10 years. 1998 = 3-4 years.
4758 2018-04-04 15:17:38 good for him! Exchanges charge millions to list crypto...

4787 2018-04-04 15:15:04 Crypto Twitter is giving TA a worse rep than it deserves because it's full of people overly confident in something that's only meant to roughly outline *possible* support/resistance lines and help with risk management - not be a magical, future-telling crystal ball.

4876 2018-04-04 15:05:22 Specific markets related to esports (they rarely offer anything more than betting on a the winner of a tournament), crypto payments accepted, potentially game skins accepted. Very different.
4877 2018-04-04 15:05:20 Taxes in crypto ? That would require a profit to have been made, and no body is profiting but those cartels

4989 2018-04-04 14:57:43 Subscribed!!  Want to XVG!
4990 2018-04-04 14:57:41 先は長いですね( ・∇・)
残念ながら(´°̥̥̥̥̥̥̥̥ω°̥̥̥̥̥̥̥̥｀)
4991 2018-04-04 14:57:39 かーーー今回彼ら目立ち過ぎだね
ここまで読んでる我々を、さらに裏かく困らせ方って、何だろうと考えてる。　自分が大口だったら。

でもここで強引に切り返すの追随ないから、金持たないしなー
4992 2018-04-04 14:57:34 #AUS #Australia introduces #crypto regulations.
Australian cryptocurrency exchanges will need to register and report to AUSTRAC
The new regulations are already in effect. 

This is to deter AML and ensure exchanges to verify users

4993 2018-04-04 14:57:31 Wow she kinda ruled except for the shooting massacre thing.
4994 2018-04-04 14:57:26 The ‘I Told You So’ folks are out in full force on $LFIN past few days..

Where were they a few weeks back when the only chatter was the crypto bulls trolling me and a select few others??
4995 2018-04-04 14:57:00 まぁ、1h足でDC間近、4h足でも8時間後くらいにはDC、下げ幅もそれなりに作ってあるわけだから。今日明日で一気に来てもおかしくはないかも。

なんかファンダ的には早すぎる謎は残るけど。
4996 2018-04-04 14:56:51 Just join their telegram.
4997 2018-04-04 14:56:48 The whole economy is screwed. They should let crypto govern itself. We need a board of directors voted by the community. 1st thing I would do is make every crypto traded on USD pairings so these idiots who hold all this btc couldn't crash the market as easy.
4998 2018-04-04 14:56:38 Well, it looks like maybe the crypto market is hitting bottom. Time to #BUIDL.
4999 2018-04-04 14:56:29 Hopefully with something other than blockfolio. I’ve found their alarm to be too delayed for action at times.
5000 2018-04-04 14:56:07 @NeerajKA Hi Neeraj, I'm working closely on Blockchain (not crypto) policy in India. Just wanted to say you guys are doing a great job!
5001 2018-04-04 14:56:03 im disgusted about the BTC price right now

5009 2018-04-04 14:55:30 have you notice that the sell order is during the morning at the occident ?
5010 2018-04-04 14:55:19 May be I do, or it's just common sense that we're going there. There is absolutely NOTHING fundamentally positive going on in crypto now. Or, we would be hitting 8K $BTC, and $150 $LTC
5011 2018-04-04 14:55:18 Fellas... are we sure Mike Pence is still alive? I swear we haven't heard a peep from him in months.

5013 2018-04-04 14:55:01 Ive been waiting TWO months for a deposit. I've had a ticket open the whole time and all they say is to keep waiting!?!?! WTF
5014 2018-04-04 14:55:00 Bitcoin is so 2012. Krugman retweet = Ripple XRP or Litecoin deposited immediately into your crypto wallet

5020 2018-04-04 14:54:43 Bitcoin & other crypto currencies are troublesome because we as people are so used to having an overpowering authority rule our lives, laws & our economy... often with fraudulent intent & trouble that we usually overlook.
5021 2018-04-04 14:54:41 Ive been waiting TWO months for a deposit. I've had a ticket open the whole time and all they say is to keep waiting!?!?! WTF
5022 2018-04-04 14:54:40 I’m seriously thinking about quitting crypto for good.
5023 2018-04-04 14:54:38 Approx. 2 billion (!) people in the world do still not have a bank account. Until recent years, they don´t have to bother open any either. Why?

5025 2018-04-04 14:54:24 Curious why you or others are opposed to premined coins. Crypto mining consumes tremendous amounts of energy which is only going to increase.
5026 2018-04-04 14:54:11 6000ドル落ちじゃないですよｗ6000ドルタッチですｗｗｗ
5027 2018-04-04 14:53:55 idek tbf but either breakout soon or slide towards 400sat mark are what I'm watching.

Random ass questions, obscure

5031 2018-04-04 14:53:26 6000ドル落ちるとアルトが…
っていうか、BTC主流が終わればいい！
5032 2018-04-04 14:53:26 Keep up the TA. You are doing great things for the crypto community. Waiting for IOST to hit it's target so I can move back into my baby, TRX either after the announcement on 4/9 or when the binance competition has concluded.
5033 2018-04-04 14:53:24 bought during mid november, realized what bitcoin is, left college and have been studying crypto ever since

5043 2018-04-04 14:52:40 Yeah it was gonna have to correct at some point!! I sold at 136 made an awesome profit...
5044 2018-04-04 14:52:37 Morning lightning fam back to the grind to flip fiat to crypto let the baby roll.
5045 2018-04-04 14:52:32 On and off ramps between Crypto and fiat is one of the biggest obstacles right now.

How can a Decentralized Exchange provide on-off ramps for Crypto?

Note:  I always capitalize Crypto and use lowercase for fiat.  We all should do this.

5049 2018-04-04 14:52:16 Being confident in your trades... One thing that I see so common is people drawing up charts, making plans, and then not following through because they aren't confident! Identify the opportunity and capitalize! #Crypto #Bitcoin #BTC

5061 2018-04-04 14:51:39 少なくとも僕はそう判断しました。下げながらショートの比率が極端に下がりながらロングのポジションが極端に増えたんですよ。いくらなんでも不自然すぎて、finexでは売り仕掛けするためで、他の取引所ではそれ以上のショートを持ってるだろうと。実際その後にfinexで一撃1300の売り浴びせが来ました。
5062 2018-04-04 14:51:35 Just because Twitter turns bullish doesn’t mean you should. I’ve seen it over and over again during this bear market. Twitter bulls aren’t a indicator for a reversal. Take your emotions out of this whole crypto thing and you’ll find it easier.

5284 2018-04-04 14:30:48 Yes. Everyone on my feed. 12 hours ago it was filled with 'x-coin is key; loading up now; buy now or cry later'. But that mistake is mine; unfollowing a bunch of people over the next couple days (not you tho).

5288 2018-04-04 14:30:42 Ha, funny cause I was currently looking back at my crypto investments and came to the conclusion that the best thing I did was buy a car in October (a puny Nissan btw, no Lambo...).

5290 2018-04-04 14:30:33 反脆さとは、衝撃を利益に変えるものがある。そういうものは、変動性、ランダム性、無秩序、ストレスにさらされると成長・繁栄する。そして冒険、リスク、不確実性を愛する。こういう現象はちまたにあふれているというのに、「脆い」のちょうど逆に当たる単語はない。

5300 2018-04-04 14:29:43 lol, were you in crypto a couple of months ago when #BTC/#ETH had a backlog and super expensive #LTC was the only thing you could use to send transactions and more importantly, it is traded on all exchanges. #LTC didn't change the world, it saved the world of cryptocurrencies.

5389 2018-04-04 14:22:52 Hello guys. Many people ask what to consider in investing in ICO, the idea and the team is important for me, and how they can be useful to the community. Here's a similar project for you #smarterthancrypto #ico @Smarter_Crypto
5390 2018-04-04 14:22:51 This ICO is emerging from a region quite scarce in blockchain projects. Most of them come from Asia, Central Europe or USA. I am really glad. I also appreciate a lot the initiative of the Black Sea Blockchain Institute ment to educate the people about crypto. We really need that!

But then again, the ecosystem of cheerleading has to continue so that the crypto twitter base doesn't die off. Still, more tweets probably means less trades.

5446 2018-04-04 14:17:54 You can’t judge a market trend in a single day.  Crypto lacks market fundamentals, while stocks can be more predictable and stable.  It’s not a get rich quick thing.

5465 2018-04-04 14:16:19 Then why say anything at all before it happens? Every crypto that has done this has failed to keep the price up after the announcement. It has to be the biggest announcement ever to even keep it from dumping. It just manipulate's the price on the market.

3. Crypto holdings volatility is priced in
4. No realistic acquirers

5560 2018-04-04 14:07:49 And if crypto is only as useful as sum of its use cases and those can get split across multiple coins .. does it still trade at same price? 

i.e. dilution of token price as end-users can transact across multiple 'service providers'

which is the kind of dilution we're debating

5649 2018-04-04 13:59:52 Crypto’s nose dived after the hype and exposure drove their values through the roof. Markets have been falling for a month but I think that larger crypto’s (bitcoin, ethereal) in general will follow a delayed but opposite trend to market health

5652 2018-04-04 13:59:18 It is though - the number of BTCs stay the same but resources (mining power, people's attention) get diluted across two 'brands'. 

And no way or arguing that in real world, forking wouldn't case e.g. FaceBook to lose revenue to FaceBookCash as a competitor materializes

5708 2018-04-04 13:53:24 social media allows gambling ads (where you are GUARANTEED to lose money) and bans crypto ads (which are changing society). So I think it's weird. Ban scams. Not crypto.

5735 2018-04-04 13:50:12 If crypto had a deeper level of adoption, it would indeed help families in third world countries save their babies and family members.  
For many of us that don't get to see the calamities that those families go through it's easy to dismiss and bully Roger instead.

5745 2018-04-04 13:48:58 ...that is down to the certain points like, once all crypto currency purchases by debit, credit, bank wire & anything else controlled, are blocked or banned by centralised banks, the only way to buy it, will be OTC!!!

5770 2018-04-04 13:47:11 One mistake a lot of people does about crypto is to think knowing the coin code (BTC, WAGE, ETH, etc) is enough to define clearly what you are talking about. But coins are not just money, like with bank notes, they are tied to a technical system. So you need the version as well.
5771 2018-04-04 13:47:05 That would be impossible to know, except when you are sunerok himself.

5848 2018-04-04 13:37:03 digital/crypto real estate? That idea is a misnomer. LEGALLY, a REIT must invest 75% of its assets in real estate, derive 75% of its income from rent on property or mortgages, and payout 90% of income in dividends to shareholders... can't crypto that.

5857 2018-04-04 13:36:00 This isn't the stock market. We're not purchasing shares of ownership of a company with fore-knowledge of things that will make a company more valuable.

5989 2018-04-04 13:21:59 誤解させてしまいましたね、5分足の戦略に問題があるかどうか、というよりは、①投資戦略上違う時間スケールで色々同時にやった方が成績は長期的に安定すると考えている、②高頻度取引の方がサーバーエラーなどBOTのイレギュラーな問題を早期発見できる、という感じです。

6129 2018-04-04 13:07:28 I think the crypto twitter community have made peace with ETC
6130 2018-04-04 13:07:25 Currently, it is complicated to convert fiat into crypto, create an account and go through the whole process of wallet addresses, brokers, transfers...
How will the big #Verge Partnership CORP instruct non-crypto people
Can this be a hinderance for mass adoption?

6134 2018-04-04 13:07:00 Charts and TA mean nothing. Crypto doesn't abide by the norm, nor is it constrained within the same parameters of a regulated stock exchange. If anyone makes enough predictions, eventually they will be right.

しかし、CMEのFAQによると先月29日の価格を適用するという項目もあります。他の方から情報をいただきました。

6202 2018-04-04 12:59:15 What you have to accept to believe in crypto:

1. The current system can be improved
2. Democratizing power is important
3. Technology is usually a net good
4. We live in a global world
5. Change isn't easy
6203 2018-04-04 12:59:11 On top of the really cheap, really healthy food you get fresh air and exercise which is way too easy to ignore if trading crypto.
6204 2018-04-04 12:59:08 Lessons learned during my #crypto journey. 1. Diverse investments require a lot of $$ (which I don't have) 2. Small amounts of $ in many #crypto = little gain (is a gamble). 3. Little $?.. invest in the best coin 4. Buy just #litecoin End of lesson. Class dismissed!

Regs might move the BTC price but no gov has the power to stop it. It's decentralized for a reason. Hence Binance is moving to Malta, gov there supports crypto, etc.

6292 2018-04-04 12:48:09 New post in Crypto Growth Network: Important tips:

When buying on signals dont put all your buying amount on one buy bid. 

For example. 
If you have 1 btc.

Then invest .20 btc on one buy bid and if coin coin goes down by 5-8% after buy bid then place another buy bid at .2…
6293 2018-04-04 12:48:00 Wow, sounds nice! My portfolio could use a bullrun

6401 2018-04-04 12:34:32 There's still a long road ahead to get to that point. Crypto's just for techies at the moment. Sadly there are a lot of elders that struggle just to use a mouse.

6404 2018-04-04 12:34:28 Trying to explain every move in the crypto market is a fools errand. That said it would've been nice to see the market not reverse overnight when the "Tax Selling" thesis has just begun. Then again equity markets are lower across the board this AM...maybe it's back to risk off.

6408 2018-04-04 12:33:54 @TheCryptomist Hi baby how have you been trading crypto? What exchange you use and how you pick your potential trades?
6409 2018-04-04 12:33:47 Please share when done... 
6410 2018-04-04 12:33:47 then there could be a heavier exodus into BTC. Until people are more scared of traditional markets (which they should be IMO) than they are of crypto, the crypto assets will get sold first in times of strife. This will not be a long term trend once the penny drops though IMO. 2/2

6683 2018-04-04 12:00:16 So you suggest to just wait for the 6h candle for BTC to close? Or just wait for it to stabilize.
I mean you ADA chart was still 6H,  a lot can happen during 6H, pkus we do have intra-day corrections as well.

6700 2018-04-04 11:59:41 True, but it may result in an increased price of the aggregate. Stability in an ecosystem may increase the probability of mainstream adoption. I suppose that’s yet to be determined, but just a thought.

Then I will chuckle and buy more crypto and a few more silver eagles!
6713 2018-04-04 11:58:08 I must admit that u have a really vital point
If volatility can be controlled using the concept of stable coins, crypto might go mainstream and many merchants will feel more secure accepting them as payment.
Nevertheless I wait for when crypto will be accepted widely without fiat

6730 2018-04-04 11:55:10 Crypto risk levels 

Currency > Utility > Equity > Asset

Currency riskiest, too many players

Utility tokens need to be researched well to understand real use cases. 

Equity/Asset tokens are less risky. But make sure the company behind it is reliable

6811 2018-04-04 11:44:38 Driving through chigwell I saw a sign...opening soon, “crypto exchange”. It beggars belief. Although with the investment being made by some large institutions, there must be some role for crypto in our economy...not as a speculation tool though clearly.

7013 2018-04-04 11:15:04 You don't need to love/hate Craig Wright to see how Vitalik, the leader of a "decentralized" network, was calling for censorship.

You expose fraud with truth, not with censorship. But I guess crypto Twitter does not care. Nice behavior for the decentralized revolution.

7025 2018-04-04 11:14:10 Virtue signaling is the most overused  term in crypto by opposition groups. Morality in tech ideation and discussion is not a bad thing. Discussing it is not a bad thing. It speaks volumes about the users of it versus the intended targets. A blanket condemnation of authenticity.
7026 2018-04-04 11:14:10 That’s great thanks for the work you do for the crypto world.  I saw a mention of you looking at casinocoin for maybe a vid, that’s cool  gimme a shout if you need any help with a wallet and transfer

The price on other exchanges & even @CoinMarketCap is 8.5k or less but #bitbns shows it 9.2k which is ridiculous.

7068 2018-04-04 11:09:28 Crypto governance is not inherently unable to be valued. Crypto is just so new + complex that there is lots of uncertainty.

Takeaway shouldn't be "don't worry about governance/decentralization", but "the first to create a good model of how to value governance will profit."

7110 2018-04-04 11:03:14 Alors c'est la que la question de la régulation est importante. Les revenus avec lesquel on achète ces bitcoins sont taxé d'une manière ou d'une autre (salaire, déclaration de revenu). Une fois que l'on fait une transaction avec ces bitcoin, cette transaction doit être déclarée.

7119 2018-04-04 11:02:22 Started as a joke. I'm not sure that the developers realized the true potential of what they were creating.

7125 2018-04-04 11:01:41 みなさんとてもスゴいリサーチ力だなぁ…羨ましい…

ただ、先を見すぎてる銘柄には投資やっぱりできないなぁ…

一歩先じゃなく半歩先に多めに、一歩先いく銘柄には少額にしておこう(´⊙ω⊙`)
aiとかまだまだ極所的にしか発達してないっていうし…
7126 2018-04-04 11:01:35 Direct to crypto I meant.  Definitely there's going to be an adjustment to trade in general as the US attempts to rein in/slow China's rise.

7130 2018-04-04 11:01:02 なのですが、こういう事を言ってるやつの裏をかいて、今回落ちきる前に上がるチャート作りができる方々なので、なかなか発言も慎重になります。
7131 2018-04-04 11:00:57 Could tank the stock market a bit and with crypto being delicious cheap there could be some money flowing into crypto assets (I could be wrong, noob speaking here) but crypto investment could be a nice diversication for stock traders.

7215 2018-04-04 10:54:10 はい。株など統合されている取引所においての原則なので、ビットコインでこの判断でいいかは、まだ誰も研究していないので、確実ではないですが…

7229 2018-04-04 10:51:15 I have heard about QuickX from a few people that have been associated with the crypto market for a long time now. According to them its an amazing and safe option, can't wait for them to launch soon!

7231 2018-04-04 10:50:55 hey man ...Datdash did a piece on your essay and refuted the claims that at the peak price of the gold and silver the cartel manipulated the price to bring it down to today's values ..I think you should rebut his assertion as its fundamental to the argument
7232 2018-04-04 10:50:54 つまりは、底作りされるまで下がる可能性が高いということですね

7240 2018-04-04 10:49:05 というかニコ初期ユーザーからすれば今までユーザー意見すらロクに聞き入れてくれない閉鎖的考えだからこそこの人の考えは危なかっしいし気がついたら腐ってそうな気がする。端的に言えば側から見た時の川上氏に信頼がないのも木曽氏優勢と見てしまう要因かも知れぬ。

7358 2018-04-04 10:34:58 this analysis is too optimistic. You should take into account 2014 trend (i know situations are different but so far trend is very similar to 2014) bitcoin most probably make 80%-85% correction. Im not expecting 95% correction in this environment. after going down 4000$ then moon

7540 2018-04-04 10:12:20 I have been reading regarding crypto and bitcoin since a protracted time currently, currently I'm able to trust it and invest! although I'm inclined to new and a less saturated ICOs and would love to grasp some choices.
7541 2018-04-04 10:12:19 Unfortunately, a lot of disruptive techs came too early and could not survive the initial phase of evolution (e.g. DigiCash or eCash). I believe other similar offerings like @PundiXLabs will bring a lot of fresh changes to the public perception on #crypto POS systems.
7542 2018-04-04 10:12:16 Do you remember when criminals hacked into the VCRs and made them part of a DDOS botnet? Or made them mine crypto-coins? And how you had to constantly monitor them for threads and intrusions? Nor do I. #IoT
7543 2018-04-04 10:12:14 #crypto exchanges charging up to $3mm for listing of an #ico. The real leak would be who the hell is paying that price? #etherdelta sounds better than that.
7544 2018-04-04 10:12:07 #Crypto Mining is very much like early integration of #Solar Power.  I.E. solar panels on your house, integrating that system into your Electricity and Hot water systems.  So yes, it can be done and is relatively easy to do.  But it can be expensive and does require attention.

7547 2018-04-04 10:11:47 it seems like another dip is about to happen. Market Cap going down like crazy. Will you hold or sell hoping to buy your coins cheaper ?  Bulls  must defend 7k uds but in my opinion BTC price will correct some more 6k possible. If Cartel info is true we can see BTC below 5k :)

7584 2018-04-04 10:06:48 It might be that bitcoin was created by the NSA but the first use was not a crypto currency. Does it change something? We will not remember who created it but who will use it.

7596 2018-04-04 10:04:10 One of the best tokens out there, enormous potential and everything they do is class.

Their biggest partnership is only with TokenPay, scamming people to have acquired a bank!
Biggest partnership Anonymous, without AML and KYC!?

8030 2018-04-04 09:05:23 There’s an unfortunate downside to crypto, and that is that it only has a defacto standard. That, I think, has a lot of people stuck with aversion to the idea. The fickle nature of value doesn’t help either. From a sales perspective however I absolutely see its utility.

8051 2018-04-04 09:03:34 2/ Pegging #crypto to Fiat in my opinion is tantamount to using fiat. 
A little history: Gold has always been the real purchasing power and store of value. 
In fact Fiat(mere paper)as we see today started out simply as a cheque(proof of ownership) issued out by banks(gold vaults)

8273 2018-04-04 08:33:56 1/2 I think the problem is way too many people got into crypto in the last 3 months and are demanding profits already which is unrealistic, the next big boom would have to come from a well known brand getting on board which isn’t looking likely yet.

8525 2018-04-04 07:55:42 Due diligence helped you avoid a 96% loss on your investment in this case. Good stuff! Yeah if the company itself couldn't provide proof of the partnership, something was fishy. Blows me away people still bought their tokens.
8526 2018-04-04 07:55:06 Not so easy. Yes, you can create indefinitely crypto currencies. But if nobody uses them/mine/stake they are useless. Also, harder and harder get to an exchange. So in time, there will be no value to create such a coin.
8527 2018-04-04 07:54:56 Bitcoin etc. are new economic cars

8601 2018-04-04 07:43:07 Because if it is as big as we suspect. It would be the first crypto with a real use case. It would be the first crypto linked to every national currency. It will be a currency. So if it only makes it to the top 5 that's 700% gains. But why would it stop there?
8602 2018-04-04 07:43:01 最近在努力的徒勞，某銀行要用ethereum做應用，但不寫go，要web3j.另一家銀行要建Crypto API platform,本來說不限定開發語言，跟他們提用go，就回覆只能用Java。

8609 2018-04-04 07:42:12 Crypto economy experts who think limited money supply is great should read any book about the 19th century. States & companies defaulted every 20 years, or had to pillage to pay back creditors. You would have lost your wealth by sword or default. How is it better than inflation?

8611 2018-04-04 07:41:50 Yeah intro background is very useful with embedded coding because it is essentially the same. Amiga intros are additionally essentially "bare metal" (no gfx libs/shaders/whatever like in PC). I won Amiga Intro in Assembly '93 and the techniques I learned then are very useful now.
8612 2018-04-04 07:41:45 Things like this make me wanna short.
8613 2018-04-04 07:41:42 Long term value will be dictated by the utility of any asset! Except for Bitcoin which is going to be like gold for the dollar.

8619 2018-04-04 07:40:32 Why should there be a consequence for PAC? Cryptopia maybe! Besides should it be illegal for investors to sell to other investors at inaccurate prices? If so every coin should be delisted and sued! Go on have a scroll down the sell orders on a coin of your choice and see

8659 2018-04-04 07:30:37 I was thinking "this is a solution to a problem that doesn't exist, with tokens", but then the WP makes it clear: this is about *cryptocurrency* advisors. So it's "this is a solution to a problem that only exists because crypto shows why regulation is good".

8796 2018-04-04 07:05:44 But I have some disagreement with you. you said that these cartels entered the market during CME case which is why prices are like this but btc has gone to bottom previously too. what were the reasons then sir? just curious to know, am not aware of it.

We all mess up from time to time, but it’s whether you learn from it that counts. Look back at your crypto trading mistakes and see where you went wrong/what you can do to stop it happening again.

8894 2018-04-04 06:48:43 I'm only saying that because recently the launch of a test or mainnet has triggered a dump. Crypto took "buy the rumour, sel the news" and turned it into "buy the hype, sell the release"

8961 2018-04-04 06:37:06 Follow his twitter. Can't speak to his technical knowledge, but in non-technical things, his ability to reason is weak. I don't think he took critical thinking. A fourth-year philosophy student would wipe the floor w him on almost any topic. Satoshi wouldn't be so weak-minded.
8962 2018-04-04 06:36:26 In order for a battle to be epic both competitors need to have equal strengths or chances. Robinhood uses what I’ve termed a “closed system”,

8977 2018-04-04 06:34:16 It’s an interpretation of price action. You objective is use different techniques that help determine what will happen to the price during the next timeframe. Originally traders were interpreting human behaviour but given more bits are used, technicals become more precise

8981 2018-04-04 06:32:53 It's not agreeableness. His thinking is sloppy & his reasoning weak.

8982 2018-04-04 06:32:42 I just somehow solved the mystery of crypto-currency but it's mad complicated and abnormally simple at the same time. It's basically monetary inbreeding. Cloning a clone per se. Eventually the DNA breaks down. Retarded money.

8996 2018-04-04 06:29:44 Disagree. I think it's abundantly clear to anyone that's followed the official story the proof is beyond doubt. The level of proof required by the scientific, sceptic and or crypto community baffles me sometimes. It's often so rigorous it's borderline stupid. Read the article.
8997 2018-04-04 06:29:19 Are you a time traveler? Circa 18th c? Because most women I know have a ton more responsibilities than men... full time jobs plus housework plus childcare. Most men I know play a lot of video games . Talking about responsibility smdh
8998 2018-04-04 06:29:12 I mean he will prob thank himself in the next year or so that he didn't sell yet.
8999 2018-04-04 06:29:08 No I get it, I wasn't trying to imply you were shilling this project. Just left the comment there for whoever felt impressed by the Forbes "coverage", as I was until I saw that it's paid for. Thanks for sharing anyways :)

9014 2018-04-04 06:26:52 Crypto pundits claim that cryptocurrencies are "risky". They are not. They are volatile, which is different.
Risk means uncertainty of outcome. In this case, the outcome is guaranteed: crypto "investors" will be scammed out of their money. They will lose 100% with 0% uncertainty.

9017 2018-04-04 06:26:01 It’ll be more of a run for Coinbase’s money when you can withdraw your crypto from Robinhood (or spend it directly through a 3rd party partnership). I will say, it is nice not having to lube up when it comes to the fees when you are just trading though.

9193 2018-04-04 05:52:25 It's common knowledge that "subs" cancel gifts and gifts should never be accepted as tribute or payment. Especially for skype sessions. You scammed yourself. Then they spam the subs posts with "hes a scammer he doesn't pay".

He sent me $100 crypto tho??
9194 2018-04-04 05:51:56 Because that would cause a loss of faith similar to or greater than the Mt Gox event? No one with a portfolio allocation in crypto would do that, unless they were planning to never return.

9447 2018-04-04 04:59:12 think so yeah, a small bounce could happen right at 7300 now because we are sitting on Fibonacci support line, but without convincing breakout out of this falling wedge, I m still bearish.
9448 2018-04-04 04:59:10 It takes adoption to get this to happen... and about 90% of people in crypto hate bcash so it’s hard to see this happening

3. Set a goal, BLOW right fuckin past it.
Last. Manifestation is beyond powerful.

9549 2018-04-04 04:37:38 When any crypto’s prime benefit of usage is ‘makes you money’, it’s probably a scam. Even if it’s the ‘first one run without human intervention’. Falling for bitconnect can be forgiven, but remember... fool me once, shame on,  shame on you. Fool me  you can't get fooled again
9550 2018-04-04 04:37:34 Eventually, merchants will give a crypto discount because they don't have to pay Visa and they won't have to secure your PII. This will take time for that to happen.

9591 2018-04-04 04:31:01 It's been nice for short players tbh, so I'm currently not even worried about the state of crypto. I've even bought and made a profit in the past month, with the only "failure" being the neckline rejection at the H&S. And for those waiting for confirmation, it wasn't even a fail.
9592 2018-04-04 04:30:41 Am really happy that this bear market has helped mature the crypto world in general
9593 2018-04-04 04:30:38 id rather have a couple $btc in a few different 5x's than half or less of a $btc in a possible 100x.........would it be incredible to do? Of course.......but I'm not putting any real money in anything thats not on a "legit" exchange. Thats playing with fire.

9602 2018-04-04 04:29:52 It's meant positive further. For btc?
9603 2018-04-04 04:29:49 Plus it rewards hodling which is not ideal for a coin used as a currency. It does make sense for a decentralized operating system like Ethereum or EOS though.
9604 2018-04-04 04:29:42 Only because Ripple gets a cut though. It’s fully premined, and you can send about 10 billion dollars in a million transactions for about a penny, so it’s basically free. Premined coins barely qualify as cryptocurrency because the consensus model is junk.

9656 2018-04-04 04:16:28 I only buy @BittrexExchange alts. Nothing shady. I played shitcoins like $bitb and $rdd but never held for too long because of delisting. I'd say the shittiest coin I own is $dgb and I'm ok with that. Its not going anywhere. 100x's are cool but ill take safe 5-10x's.

New Crypto Scam!!!

1) coin burn
2) launching testnet
3) partnering with major companies

so,  when the price shoots up immediately sell all coins. finally the price  will dip because you have nothing to offer so the price crashes.
then buy the dip.
9754 2018-04-04 03:53:38 Was talking to my tax guy today since I just started Crypto on how much tax I would have to pay, he told me if you make over $20k u have to claim it. But if you use exchange like Binance then no, only Coinbase. He shilling me to use Binance more often now

5. Traditional stock investments

Point is, there are some risks you need to take at the right time. Crypto is one such risk  #blockchain #cryptocurrency

9779 2018-04-04 03:48:55 nice to see open platform providing a low fee service which will encourage crypto use to the mainstream.
9780 2018-04-04 03:48:09 1k investment will get 10k quickly, when first huge gains kick in...we all were there Carter  hopefully a few of these new invetsors try to understand what they are buying there and see the enormous opportunities lying ahead for our society

9782 2018-04-04 03:47:33 It’s a crypto with real world use, a trust worthy team. It also will continue to succeed throughout the next few years and hopefully become as widely [or more, wouldn’t complain ;) ] accepted and used as bitcoin. Solid piece o’ tech.. viva la Litecoin 
9783 2018-04-04 03:47:33 Lol can’t wait till all this crypto bullshit blows over and you go “back” to being broke. Well worth losing the money I have invested in it.

9890 2018-04-04 03:27:27 If rejected at the 7330 region we can expect to drop back for a c wave. 1st likely stop would be 7k area. If it holds, my view is that we go back to test the wedge line so will consider another long from here. A break over the wedge could signal a move to 7800. Then death drop?

9904 2018-04-04 03:24:26 Doesn’t look legit to me tbh. Not sure why the volume is climbing quite that high. Maybe wash trading.

9931 2018-04-04 03:18:51 I think it has something to do with the culture. I can't deal with the western desserts. Way too much sugar. Never understood how people get addicted to it.
9932 2018-04-04 03:17:44 Yup

9936 2018-04-04 03:16:58 
9937 2018-04-04 03:16:33 Your point is they will buy the winning companies to defend their position?

That seems plausible. But some of these might not be acquirable if they are Crypto.
