57 2018-09-09 23:18:49 Why do they do that? Because our Congress is enriching themselves on healthcare & military industrial complex. That’s why they vote 4big military budgets but money  never goes to troops or vets. We need to insist they all divest themselves of stocks. They can buy mutual funds.

94 2018-09-09 22:25:29 in the crypto case I find essential that users undersands what is he buying. Why would you have 'stocks' of crypto when you can have the crypto itself? because it's easier, but you are paying a price for that ux

102 2018-09-09 22:19:24 Honestly, I wish I had of looked at $emh last week. It just came out of some healthy consolidation and a great day on Friday. Chart looks similar to all the other strong mj stocks. It should reach ath if not higher. $acb chart does NOT look like this.
103 2018-09-09 22:18:39 BTW, if you look at 2018 since Jan, market patterns look very similar-narrow rally focused on growth stocks, IWM beating SPX. Little advance in large-cap indices since Jan. Cyclicals and financials grinding down. Hang Seng and cyclicals like MU showing mid-2015 pattern right now.

107 2018-09-09 22:13:31 We've seen this movie before--late 2014 thru H12015. Was a 9-month phenomenon. Dow/SPX went up 6%, not 60%. TLT soared (front-end loaded). Secular growth stocks soared, cyclicals/financial sank, EM struggled. Ended in general risk-off. Why would it be different this time?

142 2018-09-09 21:43:57 Trade war and stocks have nothing to do with misguided kneeling/protest in football.  You  stated it incorrectly.  I pointed it out.   Period, end of story.  Moving on to things that matter.
143 2018-09-09 21:42:49 Ok then, show me the majority of Americans own stocks and then show me if they own the majority of stocks within corporations.

152 2018-09-09 21:33:10 Everybody leaves. During the flash crash everybody left. Stocks like P&G traded for pennies. Where were the long term investors? That was shocking. Where were the funds?  During the 1987 crash nobody knew where the markets were. Bids on the screen were were worthless.

154 2018-09-09 21:31:04 Isn't it sweet that the even more wealthy can buy, sell and trade stocks? What about that mom working 80+ hours to pay rent and feed her children, shouldn't she be allowed to play the stock market as well? How can she do that when she barely makes enough to get by?

156 2018-09-09 21:29:36 Imagine that.  When companies buy back stocks, they are releasing cash into the economy. It's the opposite of hoarding. Previous owners of stock now have more cash on hand to spend, invest, donate and save, all of which helps the economy grow and helps other people.
157 2018-09-09 21:29:13 That makes no sense. If the pension fund invested the same money in stocks, yes they could go up and down, but over the long term yields are predictable, and carry on forever. If you buy stocks, you don’t hand them back or sell them for pennies once dividends give you a +ve ROI.
158 2018-09-09 21:28:09 What is the advantage of buying stocks during a high market valuation period if you plan to sell in over 30 years?
159 2018-09-09 21:27:26 You need to check your facts. Their stocks are in fact down. If you're going to try to spew hate at least spew  honestly

168 2018-09-09 21:20:08 key point ur missing here is with stocks u OWN a stake in the company with utility tokens u do not, if u own stock in a company goes illiquid they will sell assets pay debt n if any left they will give it to shareholders u also get rights to dividends n votes in ICOs none apply
169 2018-09-09 21:18:44 I thought most of it sounded good, but not the part where people can buy the homes for almost nothing at some future date. Surely the pension funds need to keep hold of them and continue to collect the returns, just as they would with eg stocks, bonds or any other asset.

you consider leaving Twitter in protest for boycotting it?  I only joined because you are on Twitter?  If you were to leave, taking 50 million with you?  Their stocks would plummet, they would stop.

191 2018-09-09 20:59:57 @elonmusk Also, I want to say that I will be buying some shares of your stock while these prices are so stupid low. It's unusual that the market reacts this when a joint is lit while pot stocks are booming. I think you have a great company.

201 2018-09-09 20:53:09 If that were true I’m sure the SEC would be at his door with an arrest warrant. There are reasons for the stocks decline, but they are short term reasons unrelated the company’s performance. Thank you for your service sir, Semper Fi.
202 2018-09-09 20:51:22 I think the reason why they put that football player for the face of Nike just for attention. They know what this guy did and wanted some attention to try increase stocks and sales for the products.There is no such thing as bad publicity really

By Sue Chang, Ryan Vlastelica
213 2018-09-09 20:43:15 When you buy a token, you are not making an investment in the company. The tokens and the company hopefully have some sort of relationship, but it's not tied to it like a security, and the earnings to it are not correlated like buying public stocks
214 2018-09-09 20:43:08 Please explain how buybacks are part of a gop tax plan and not because the economies growth and projection that their companies will grow and they are that confident about it? Thats great news u idiot stocks have no impact but on investers
215 2018-09-09 20:42:28 Well then technically Nike didn't lose billions and their stocks just blipped. They'll be fine. Nike isn't going anywhere anytime soon. If their sales have gone up 31% compared to last year's 17% for the same time period they seem pretty strong. 
216 2018-09-09 20:41:08 The Vegas shooter killed 59 and injured 851 using bump stocks, the deadliest mass shooting by an individual in our history. Both Trump AND the NRA are cool with banning bump stocks. I'm pro 2nd Amendment but you gotta be reasonable, man.

229 2018-09-09 20:32:44 I literally just said to myself 'thats enough law homework for the moment, gonna take a break and research some stocks' and 2012 me would not recognize me in the slightest.
230 2018-09-09 20:31:15 So twitter suspends someone because they criticized Obama.  Hey twitter you have no problem with the nasty appalling comments made at our. Current president.  He has done good for me. 2020 go trump.  Economy great unemployment lowest in decades.  Stocks rising constantly.  .

238 2018-09-09 20:22:14 Due to quotas & no catch zones stocks are  recovering. By-catch affects everyone, it’s shit but difficult to fix given modern netting & factory ships.

Probably just super cheap stocks for right now but it seems like a good idea!

272 2018-09-09 20:01:03 Who are you really hurting????????   Nike stocks was up 39% after Kaepernick video.   Oh so now you take away the shoe most children want to wear?   Dumb and Dumber!
273 2018-09-09 20:00:48 In Greece there is NO tax on gains from trading stocks  and the climate it perfect.

275 2018-09-09 19:58:13 Sorry to be a pest dude but I can't actually open an trading account from the UK to trade USA penny stocks, all the brokers said they dnt trade for UK traders, any tips? 
Thank you in advance
276 2018-09-09 19:58:07 I bought a 100 shares of pot stocks from my cell phone this week.  Never thought I'd be saying that 20 years ago #cannabisindustry #potstocks
277 2018-09-09 19:55:47 you can short puts (and calls, and futures contracts), like you short stocks
278 2018-09-09 19:55:44 @KatiePavlich somebody needs to enlighten u on what every middle class person is screaming at the screen when you declare loud and proud at least once a day us middle class got all of $2.32 every TWO weeks raise due to the precious tx cuts! Most of us dont own stocks
279 2018-09-09 19:55:36 I gotta start investing in JUUL stocks
280 2018-09-09 19:54:06 I agree with you based on a viewing we arranged with a @PurplebricksUK seller who altered the viewing time. Only a sample of 1 but backed up our view that whilst online selling saves fees/commission, it's not right for all & there's still a place for the more personal touch too.
281 2018-09-09 19:53:23 Des boutiques sans stocks, à la fois show room et point relais, en centre-villes ? Moins de "derniers kms" puisque livraisons centralisées, emplois en ville, vélos cargos entre les entrepôts et les centres-villes ... Et + de produits dans les boutiques qui n'ont pas à stocker ...
282 2018-09-09 19:52:49 Of course they would.  Buy stocks now while they are cheap!
283 2018-09-09 19:49:06 I would bet you that if the stocks are tanking it's because they've already taken their money out and what's left is the John Q public and that's not pretty. That will strip the remaining wealth from the guys that have a 401k spread out. Sick what they can do to us.
284 2018-09-09 19:44:46 The only reason stocks are doing good is because the Corporations received Unprecedented TAX CUTS! They are buying back their OWN STOCKS! We aren’t as stupid as your cult! There is no economic growth for the middle class and below, there is only shrinkage; creating a bigger gap
285 2018-09-09 19:44:43 To be clear, I have no evidence that all (or any) cards were printed on BOTH stocks but given the quantities at hand and how many different runs Fleer made of this set…
286 2018-09-09 19:42:54 no way to know for sure until pr- but i think they are getting money from studios for being one of the listed available movies for the day
287 2018-09-09 19:42:44 I agree it is going to be very ugly. I wish that those with stocks and shares stop allowing their emotions to rule them and cash out now with their profits..... Before the Big Money does! After that, it's game over!
288 2018-09-09 19:41:57 Stock market is up because of tax break to corporations. They used the money to buy back stocks and pay dividends to stockholders and give CEO's raises, more money for the wealthy. GDP has been growing steady on the same trend since 2009.
289 2018-09-09 19:41:36 i might shop might go get some stocks. coppin shit im Carlton, im too clean im mobb. pass that shit like Stockton
290 2018-09-09 19:40:09 Clearly sir you have Nike numbers mixed up with yours. Clearly sales are +31% fun fact how about you check the stocks. Why don't you do something productive because being president is not your fortè at all

292 2018-09-09 19:38:46 I’m confused..... or investing in stocks?

297 2018-09-09 19:34:48 but is movie pass still paying regular prices for the tickets? or have they worked something out with the theaters?  Movie Pass will loose money if they don't do this...simple.

299 2018-09-09 19:34:24 I prefer a hybrid approach. I will allocate more to our mortgage unless a better opportunity presents itself. In 2013 I felt stocks and REITs were a better opportunity. Today after the tremendous growth in both, I love the guaranteed return from paying down the mortgage.
300 2018-09-09 19:34:20 Many Trump supporters have no 401k. Many Americans have no 401 k, no stocks, no savings. Trump is not acting in his supporters best interest, it’s just an illusion. Another Trump con job

302 2018-09-09 19:32:00 Yes. Still at Bakkavor and a new role there too now.  Airbnb is exciting and you’re in a good location for demand I imagine.   New businesses are VivaMK, which is home shopping and Kuvera, which is an investment and education platform for crypto, stocks and forex
303 2018-09-09 19:31:58 Ahaha to you market cap is total defection from stocks.

Thank you.
307 2018-09-09 19:27:14 Stocks will bounce back so long as the company does not appear shaken up and they stay on target. New investors are just finding their way to you as we speak :)
308 2018-09-09 19:23:51 We don’t know if it will matter in 60 days. The point was the ad did not help Nike. There are some ignorant people that think it did. Clearly they know nothing about stocks.
309 2018-09-09 19:22:50 You ever get so high your stocks fall
310 2018-09-09 19:21:53 I tend to agree. 

Ross seems to push trendy stocks. 

Anybody can look at what's popular and promote it. No special insight there.
311 2018-09-09 19:21:42 It's a very small demographic that are boycotting it though. It's been a relatively successful campaign, it didn't even see the usual drop in stocks before climbing again. They just climbed
312 2018-09-09 19:21:29 What have you done about guns? Specifically military assault rifle types of weapons? Bump stocks? Extra large magazines? You know the ones with over 20 which is what the military started out with in their assault rifles. Done nothing about that have you? #SAD

318 2018-09-09 19:17:46 Here's some truths about the pirate:  I'm a veteran 10+ yr investor with a diversified portfolio including ETFs and my fun stocks.  I know the drill.  This is a long game, but I'm overly impatient about $XRP even though it's a minority position of my pie.   #needtochilll.

320 2018-09-09 19:16:07 The greatest stocks are not the ones that raise very high but are the ones that don't fall

325 2018-09-09 19:13:22 Yes, @iamrudramurthy should be included for IC 2018. He has spoken about his previous investments in multibagger stocks like in Shilpa med etc. Why not be open minded and include him to. We can learn more through this.

There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks.
私たちの株式投資への意欲をそぐような要因がかなりある。
327 2018-09-09 19:12:23 It feels that way now, and I do think there's a slight "bubble" relative to what normal stocks typically do.  That's b/c there are no developed fundamentals records.  But it's not a cypto bubble--this is a real emerging industry.
328 2018-09-09 19:11:59 Diverting again I see. We can safely say you are the only person that did not attend college and has zero knowledge of stocks. #keeptripping over yourself.
329 2018-09-09 19:11:37 Anyone wanna teach me about trades and stocks!?!?!?!
330 2018-09-09 19:11:06 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
331 2018-09-09 19:10:31 I would totally be buying Tesla stocks right now if I had any money or really any knowledge of how to actually buy stocks and cash them in...
332 2018-09-09 19:08:28 First two already happen 
Bump stocks make a gun less effective for killing 
“High Capacity Magazines” (normal size on guns) have actual uses 
Banning a private bill of sale is ridiculous 
333 2018-09-09 19:08:02 Horrible taste. Shoprite stocks those purple ones though
334 2018-09-09 19:05:55 2/2...not much of a "closely held religious belief" is it? Other Religious groups have divested from stocks that are offensive to them. And I have to assume you are celibate unless you have children for every year you're having sex w/a woman, if you think BC is abortion.
335 2018-09-09 19:04:47 When I stopped for months (should do it again) I swear San Pellegrino stocks would have sky rocketed.
336 2018-09-09 19:04:29 Posted on my w/l
337 2018-09-09 19:03:03 I'm hearing conflicting reports of people going "oh man Ultimate is so much faster wow" and "wow it takes forever for you to lost a stock"

regardless, I feel like 3 stocks is ideal for this game. We don't need to do 2 stocks again...

340 2018-09-09 19:01:51 You seen Dudleys score  the Miami game isn’t on atm due to lightning
341 2018-09-09 19:01:49 Correction, currently sales and stocks are up so i am right. Lol. Things will have to change for you to be right.
342 2018-09-09 18:57:35 Hey Charlotte, the team have advised they have stocks and some on the display shelf - the team will be reminded these are not just for display and for sale 
343 2018-09-09 18:56:04 "Owning the libs" is an odd concept: one might "own stocks" by purchase or "own a view" by admitting it. This 'owning' means that one noted in one's mind (or to one's audience) that one has done something, like defacing a poster. How self-congratulatory -like a prayer to oneself!
344 2018-09-09 18:54:11 No one wants to get off to a bad start. At least @MiamiDolphins are winning at the moment #FinsUp
345 2018-09-09 18:53:38 Perry wants an Option buy on many stocks. He has zero access to the defense of our country. Just because you are a manager does not mean anything except for the fact that you will be the first to be fired when your rulers tell their enablers to trash you.
346 2018-09-09 18:53:20 also my gf did not understand why you can't buy half of a tesla stock since she is coming from crypto and doing stocks on robin hood for the first time ever.
347 2018-09-09 18:50:14 Well currently, sales and stocks are up so you are losing this argument. Not much more to say than sales are up. You lost.
348 2018-09-09 18:49:54 Stocks are up in large part due to these corporations buying back their own stocks with the tax cut they were given. Unemployment under Trump is around 21% where it was around 23% under Obama. I repeat "labor force participation rate is near historic lows&so is money velocity...

353 2018-09-09 18:46:39 Jim Rickards is a salesman. His financial advive is terrible ( to not buy stocks) before the bull market began). He sells his ' advise' to naive people.

355 2018-09-09 18:40:44 Il faut bien écouler les vieux stocks 
356 2018-09-09 18:40:33 v true. but for me the only reason for me not buying #RSW again is that it will tend to move up/down with the general market...all the stocks I hold are in theory  ‘special situation’ hidden value stocks so theoretically should be more resilient to overall market gyrations
357 2018-09-09 18:39:03 Ross??
358 2018-09-09 18:37:40 Day traders are similar to online poker players. Not for the apprehensive. The concept of picking stocks that can be left alone, with some reasonable amount of selling and buying, is the same method Warren Buffett has used to be as successful as he became.
359 2018-09-09 18:35:34 Happy Sunday. Nike’s stocks have risen 31% 
360 2018-09-09 18:35:13 My grandpa told me that he had money from his 401k invested in Jeff Bezos years ago and he had to pull it out because they stopped allowing stocks into certain people. We would’ve actually been rich, and I’m kinda sad about it.
361 2018-09-09 18:34:11 Because Equities are Financial Instruments but not Monetary Instruments. Bitcoin and Zcash aspire to be money, like early stage precious metal. (Think Gold after its discovery but before it was widely used as money.) BTC/ZEC are competing against Gold, Silver, Fiat, not stocks.
362 2018-09-09 18:33:49 Are religion stocks down or something? Why are there so many new shows and movies promoting "god"? #GodFriendedMe

365 2018-09-09 18:32:25 AFX just pipped it when I had some funds. RSW next. Unlucky Rhom ive had many of those stocks!! I guess its never too late to buy a quality business just got to not anchor back to original sell price.

371 2018-09-09 18:27:24 Bro, if I knew or had time to learn anything about stocks, I would have bought shares from Tesla after that podcast (which was great) aired. All of this hoopla is just dumb, imo.
372 2018-09-09 18:26:29 You can’t forget the educated white people who also voted for him. I know many. Don’t have statistics but imho many of those regret it, but they’re also delighted by the increased $$$ they have now, tax reform, 401ks, stocks, etc. rePUBICans have benefited immensely.

379 2018-09-09 18:20:34 Yes thanks frank. Very good very funny. I do not understand Marxism. Marx didn't invent it. He wrote about how capatalisim works. Very accurately. But he makes no real recommendations on how to change it. Owning the means of production? Our Pentions invested in stocks?
380 2018-09-09 18:18:44 Bhai, I am not recommending any stock. I am just sharing the findings. Cyclicals have high risk and high reward. I like HEG over Graphite. Both are super duper risky stocks. These are not buy and forget stocks by any chance.

386 2018-09-09 18:15:13 Salam Asad, Please don't revert tax rates for salaried class as done by Muftah though he did that illegally for year he had no mandate for. I suggest instead create incentives for salaried to invest money into stocks /funds/bonds. Revision will give less than 100 Bn.

20% of stocks accounted for all the gains

You can keep the food stamps, and I will keep my job

404 2018-09-09 17:49:34 Stocks dropped
405 2018-09-09 17:49:08 These stocks are relatively reasonably valued vs canopy but still don’t have reasonable valuations. Take a look at Delta Nine for value
406 2018-09-09 17:49:06 I'm not financially stable enough to own stocks.  Whatever economic growth you're referencing isn't improving my life. Guess I need to keep waiting for the trickle down...?
407 2018-09-09 17:47:50 I don't doubt it. They new their stocks dropped,  they were being boycotted so I'd course Colin's lib and followers purchased crap.  The same we did for in-n-out.
408 2018-09-09 17:46:52 My reasons behind switching to reds also was I thought a lot about risk/reward .a red Fsmash or grab would have same risk as a yellow but slightly better reward. I want to maximize my rewards and advantage state w Olimar and I think I’ll secure more stocks  
409 2018-09-09 17:46:29 It was pointed out in another thread that as sec energy, good ol Ricky is actually in charge of all our nuclear facilities and even weapon stocks.
410 2018-09-09 17:46:25 It’s not bad. I never called you bad. But use less stocks. Lol.

412 2018-09-09 17:44:46 @UvA_Accounting Why wouldn't a small company just buy all its stocks from day 1? Is the reason for allowing others to buy so they can raise money? It seems like a small gain compared to a big potential loss of profit to me.

414 2018-09-09 17:44:33 Read that as "stocks" and was really confused...

422 2018-09-09 17:39:20 I do Nike stocks to take a dip so I can get in at good price. If you're really mad about the new nike just do it campaign with Colin Kaepernick, please sell your stocks

427 2018-09-09 17:37:18 Love the show! One of your rules is that you don’t’ buy a stock with a peg ratio of >2, yet some of the stocks you recommend like CRM  and ATVI have a peg that exceeds 2.
428 2018-09-09 17:36:55 Alibaba Chairman Jack Ma told New York Times he’ll step down from Alibaba Monday

Alibaba (BABA), Baidu (BIDU), Tencent Holdings (TCEHY): Now may be a good time to snap up Chinese internet stocks, many of which have tumbled as much as 26% in the past three months, says Barron’s.
429 2018-09-09 17:36:41 It really says something that the newspaper stand outside the local Bargain Booze stocks nothing but the Daily Mail
430 2018-09-09 17:35:47 Ummm, nobody said stocks were down bc of football.  Smh
431 2018-09-09 17:34:42 Yeah big deal. They’re a strong underweighting to nonexistent in any smart portfolio. What dope would want to be Long China-sensitive US stocks anyway, especially autos?  None of the experts or analysts, including us, have recommended standard weighting in US autos in a decade.
432 2018-09-09 17:33:32 Damn i need some nike stocks 
433 2018-09-09 17:33:12 There losing investor. Stocks are way down.
434 2018-09-09 17:32:02 Well I have built a sizable investment free portfolio but investing and systematically withdrawing money from growth and reinvesting that money in new stocks
435 2018-09-09 17:31:51 There stocks are way down.
436 2018-09-09 17:31:49 Stocks are down because of trade war uncertainty not because of football
437 2018-09-09 17:30:02 As long as you stick to your own style, you get the good and bad in your own approach. #trade #forex #stocks
438 2018-09-09 17:29:31 You know very little about stocks (or math) if you think a 2-point dip is “way down” or even something to be alarmed about. Companies who have had other controversial issues in the news have had much more major fluctuations.

449 2018-09-09 17:17:49 It’s cool in two months they will all be buying Nike again and Nike stocks will continue to climb
450 2018-09-09 17:17:40 Then why is their stocks falling! I've never bought Nike, now I never will!

452 2018-09-09 17:15:34 Common person does not own stocks
453 2018-09-09 17:14:51 Inspite of reading,updating,analysing & discussing about stocks.Inspite of qualifications, finally what matters is luck.If you bought Infy and sold too early or bought satyam /penta and hold it for long term.Honestly,market is a mystery. No education/experience is sufficient.
454 2018-09-09 17:14:00 To me there is nothing called long term investing in Stock Markets. Buy and forget is foolishness...  You have to monitor and churn your stocks on a regular basis.. I have been holding ICICI Bank for may be two decades now... how I wish It was HDFC Bank instead of ICICI Bank...

456 2018-09-09 17:11:29 WHAT? You must have a lot invested in stocks. The rest of America remains stuck under the greedy corporate boot. You're a tool.
457 2018-09-09 17:11:12 For class we are reading a New Yorker article about the art world in 2005 and it is so obvious now that all these hedge fund managers were offloading their stocks and portfolios into art, preparing for 2007/8/9
458 2018-09-09 17:11:10 Oh gawd , how are your 2 penny stocks. One is half a penny and the other 1 penny. Way to fuck up a good thing. You , Frank , and Sheldon all deserve each other!
459 2018-09-09 17:11:08 Nonsense, most stocks are owned by mutual funds and pension funds and are assets in IRAs, 401ks, and other retirement savings accounts.
460 2018-09-09 17:10:56 So it should be the other way round too when the petrol prices come down.. till your stocks last. Will be a greater initiative.
461 2018-09-09 17:09:48 Stocks are down since Friday, now is the time to buy  @iamSelfPaid2
462 2018-09-09 17:09:25 Viewership most likely declined because the @NFL were cowards and sided with Trump on the kneeling issue. That turned a lot of viewers off. Look at what happens to companies who gave Trump the , their sales go through the roof and so do their stocks (i.e Nike, Amazon, Dicks).
463 2018-09-09 17:07:36 What happens if stocks go sideways for the next 5 years and house prices climb?
464 2018-09-09 17:07:34 Much like the bull market, which most Americans have no stake in (84% of stocks owned by richest 10%) and the rise in productivity (which hasn’t been met with commensurate wage growth), I wonder what unexpectedly underwhelming results a record-low unemployment rate will show.
465 2018-09-09 17:06:47 It has to be said. Especially when people still confuse Ripples success with XRP's. People need to be aware of how much risk they're willing to tolerate. This market is highly volatile like penny stocks. It's best to know it can go great one min and extremely bad the next..
466 2018-09-09 17:06:35 Fácil:
Stocks (herencia monstruosa del kirchnerismo) + Flujos (incompetencia del macrismo + sequía + cambio del ciclo global) = crisis económica
Cada uno pone los porcentajes, de acuerdo a su ideología y su saber y entender. Para mí, 70% (K) - 30% (M) de responsabilidad.
467 2018-09-09 17:06:31 Crypto and stocks are absolutely uncorrelated. I can imagine crypto only as a part of subculture. You can use BTC in developing countries as alternative cash but it is only because they don't have access to usd.
468 2018-09-09 17:04:54 we have had the longest bull market in our history - as least that is what they say - so what did many of the companies do with their cuts - buy back stocks - so who paid for these purchases - we did - the tax payers - these cuts did next to nothing for me-here come the tariffs!
469 2018-09-09 17:03:51 ~51% of Americans own stocks. ~84% are controlled by ~10% of the richest Americans
470 2018-09-09 17:03:43 @timothysykes do you use stocks to trade charts & level 2 when you're in a trade or the charts & level 2 on the broker you're using at the moment?
471 2018-09-09 17:02:29 Just been asked what stocks to buy that I hold which are at near lows with the greatest chance of large gains over 5 years. My reply was NBB KLN and SYS.  For all my new followers these are in my early recovery folio which is riskier by nature but tends to outperform.  
DYOR ETC
472 2018-09-09 17:01:42 Now and then average numbers are misleading. Wheat export stocks at the Soth are rapidly going down and exporters'll have to increase deliveries from Central Russia but they'll face troubles in making up export shipments as a share of milling wheat in Central Russia is just 44%.
473 2018-09-09 17:00:49 I’m so good at picking stocks. All mine are green
474 2018-09-09 16:59:36 Still lost $50 billion in stocks. What’s it worth it after u lose that much for kaperdick??? Wtf is going on in this world. Sweat shop workers and fuck America attitude. It again makes me sick#

478 2018-09-09 16:55:42 @YopaProperty were overly intrusive as part of trying to arrange viewings. Seemingly putting their commercial interests ahead of getting their seller viewings.

We've had viewings cancel / rearranged with no explanation to times they've plucked out of the air (and we can't make).
479 2018-09-09 16:55:27 Because they're a specific size for my specific model of Jeep Compass apparently. The guy at Good Year told me the only other car that takes this size is a Dodge Avenger. So no one stocks them they have to be ordered. The only reason this place has them is because they ordered
480 2018-09-09 16:54:31 Wow it would be so terrible to be such a high maintenence miserable shit that youd pull your stocks outta a company like tesla just bc the CEO partakes in the devils lettuce lol
481 2018-09-09 16:53:09 Love it! when my stocks go up, maybe it will split. Again! Bahaha!
482 2018-09-09 16:52:59 As a whole, of course it's done for 1000x.
But a few smart picks will still give you 10-50x in a relatively short period of time compared to non-OTC stocks
483 2018-09-09 16:52:23 That’s online sales I said “stocks” inferring the stock market which means the entire brand itself
484 2018-09-09 16:51:58 How do you pick stocks? To analyze.
485 2018-09-09 16:51:50 Yes it's awful. Lowest unemployment, 401k and stocks highest ever. Just god awful

488 2018-09-09 16:48:54 Most stocks though are owned by the wealthiest people in the country. They get the value from other people's work.

517 2018-09-09 16:30:49 A risk-averse investor dislikes risk and, therefore, stays away from high-risk stocks or investments and is prepared to forego higher rates of return. If you are one of these people than stay away from crypto currencies. I am not one of these peoples.

One is a change of outdated law and policy and the other is a trend in it's infancy that is based on marketing but hasnt provided numbers to back the company valuations.

525 2018-09-09 16:26:38 Worldwide Stocks and economies are falling hard because of trump's policies.   USA stocks and economic reports near records.  But last week the FANG stocks decined a lot.  Is rump's and republicans policies finally catching up with USA?

527 2018-09-09 16:24:21 Giving rich people and businesses millions of dollars of tax payers money...to invest in the stocks they own...will make the stock market go up. Wages for people that CANT AFFORD STOCKS are still too low. Raising wages will lower the need for welfare.Put $ into people not stocks
528 2018-09-09 16:24:13 Market is driven by some selected stocks in all stock exchanges all over the world. Actually the comparison is between the major, like you mentioned 7, stocks. Rest move as per sentiment.
529 2018-09-09 16:21:39 Fixing our healthcare system so people can get preventative care would actually save us money in the long run. Same thing with wages. Instead of giving tax cuts to corporations to buy back stocks we should be forcing them to pay people living wages...
530 2018-09-09 16:21:26 Might explain the weakness in the stocks
531 2018-09-09 16:20:58 When I was a kid, my grandfather used to have me check the stocks for him at least once a day. Naturally, some days they were up and others they were not. It doesn't take a genius to see that markets often fluctuate.
532 2018-09-09 16:20:55 Wouldn't you think that with all this manufacturing coming back to the US manufacturing stocks would be skyrocketing?  This year.  IBM -11%.  GM -18%  MMM -9% Ford -25% US Steel -22%.  Something isn't adding up here.
533 2018-09-09 16:19:45 Good news 
Best results 
Best offer 
Creates a price volume spike which fades 

A series of good news in a counter with constant rise is suspicious 

That's where price and time gets imbalaced with space and wee see a series of lower circuits 

U can find many stocks like that

536 2018-09-09 16:17:00 People keep saying, "Well, you don't want someone who works on a factory floor to smoke weed on the job, that would be dangerous and bad for the company." But Elon smoked weed "on the job," and it caused the company's stocks to catastrophically drop, so why isn't he fired?

538 2018-09-09 16:16:42 Impatience is a bad virtue to have in investment. Have seen that in many senior investors and newbies alike. Whether stocks or Cryptocurrencies.

539 2018-09-09 16:16:12 "Bump stocks may be legally sold in New Jersey. But they cannot actually be mounted on a firearms under state law, say law enforcement officials."
Makes sense

"A bump stock is considered a 'mechanism' not requiring that the trigger be pressed for each shot."
Strict legal wording
540 2018-09-09 16:15:50 A market is a market, whether it be crypto, stocks, options, etc... Even if you have below average technical analysis, but good risk management, you'll be fine.

542 2018-09-09 16:14:37 9/11 had people short stocks, take off from work, pretend to read to school kids intentionally, pretend it was all a huge surprise. They should all be kissed.

544 2018-09-09 16:13:59 apple stocks rise by 69%.
545 2018-09-09 16:12:00 I think the overall market is still in an uptrend.  It was just a scary week because  the household tech names got sold. 
Aside from that a lot is still working.  This week I made sure to only include stocks still above their 20 day and within 5% of 52 week high.
546 2018-09-09 16:11:45 The strongest #stocks will behave like the strongest stocks. That means: Immediate #reaction after a down move, new highs, strong volume. If you don't see this, be cautious.

Now they are working for Netflix, making more $

So, what does it matter now?
Americans are still dead.

None of the liars held accountable.
549 2018-09-09 16:10:47 Is it the royal ‘we’ in Naya Pakistan!! Please check the PSX summary online. Stocks down for the last week..And then try and sell property. And also whilst you are at it pls recommend an overhaul of the statistical bureau.
550 2018-09-09 16:09:27 Although I'm all for the pipeline - I am dead set against fish farms that aren't land based. Their is too much scientific evidence that they are a disaster to wild stocks.
551 2018-09-09 16:09:08 Bhai no worries. Btw about patience now a days many talk big fundas. The only thing I said is let us get basics right first .  Patience wisdom on wrong stocks kis kamke.  U interpreted it completely Ulta.
552 2018-09-09 16:07:21 Show me proof, because I think it’s a lie.....  stocks are down, how are sales up....hmmmmmm!
553 2018-09-09 16:06:54 Hmm a trillion dollar tax cut on the super westerly who but back their own stocks tends to artificially inflate the market. #PutinsApprentice
554 2018-09-09 16:05:47 None of those, but definitely sadder... I ran out of coffee. But happy day today, stocks replenished

558 2018-09-09 16:03:40 Not so many #stocks on my #watchlist for next week. Sold some stocks with weak reaction and kept my winners. I had to step on the brake a little bit to reduce my exposure.
559 2018-09-09 16:02:58 Stocks going up savings interest going up pay raise also n Korea stable all is good. Except for cry babies that can't open eyes to see.
560 2018-09-09 16:02:28 Just like Nike stocks are down too. Right Donald?
561 2018-09-09 16:02:14 This is a stockmarket joke, He takes a legal cannabis hit, and his stock dives, while Big Weed Corps stocks triple on the news. Its all stupid paper assets anyway.
562 2018-09-09 16:02:05 Meron ka ate na carat bong?? Ask ko sila.. baka may naghahanap pa.. kasi nung bumili ako last 5 stocks na lang and madami din nag aantay
563 2018-09-09 16:01:34 No southern “hit” will not last long and the stocks will once again lead the markets
564 2018-09-09 16:00:25 You'll have to look into it, but as far as I'm aware it's super similar to our TFSA. TFSA you can contribute to once you are 18. Withdraw any time. No capital gains at all. Contribute with after tax income. Can hold long stocks and options (and other stuff, not short though)
565 2018-09-09 15:59:55 The DM I just got was Hella good news. My stocks will soon be rising again.
566 2018-09-09 15:59:53 I am not questioning earning predictably or gr8ness of biz. I am highlighting what mkt is paying 4 those earnings. Big difference in valuations 10 years ago & now. IMO next 10 yrs returns 4rm a basket of these stocks will b nowhere close 2 last 10 yrs returns. Time will tell 
567 2018-09-09 15:59:11 This was supposed to be a secret but during the great coddle debate we culchies drew up a plan to flood the M50 and use it as a mate there by cutting Dublin off until all your sausages ran out and then you'd have to come crawling back to replenish your stocks.
568 2018-09-09 15:59:07 Agree with unloved stocks that news is due on.  

I have a wall chart that I forward plot all news I expect. 

Along with the price at the point of coverage and the briefest comment re event. 

Plot dozens and tend momentum trade from that. 

So much more visual than electronic.
569 2018-09-09 15:58:30 But there IS an agenda with stocks and our economy in general.
570 2018-09-09 15:57:00 Am i the only one who stocks up on Candles for fall? 
571 2018-09-09 15:56:58 That may be what us 'normals' think of the stock market, but when you actually dig into the numbers you find that the bulk of stocks are held by institutional investors (401k funds) which underpin virtually all retirement plans
572 2018-09-09 15:55:28 Not sure if my supplier has stocks pa with first press eh :(

574 2018-09-09 15:55:18 When a hurricane is coming and you didn’t got to the shops quick enough to by water stocks and end up having to buy water marketed to idiots as gluten free, calorie free, and contains special H2O. What a load of shit. At least there wasn’t a run on sardines.
575 2018-09-09 15:53:21 Antonio much respect and love for your work. I just don't understand why not address those specific questions to Boyce Watkins and others that are saying "buy stocks and do for self people and save money"  If the Data is undeniable that The D.O.S don't have the money as a group.
576 2018-09-09 15:52:17 Well, at least the sales made up for the 3% or 3.5 billion dollars it lost in stocks.

582 2018-09-09 15:48:12 From Natural Beige to Ivory Beige real quick.  sabi na ngaba na di na ko natural beige kasi nag lighten up na skin ko. (charrr!  )  dami ko pang stocks ng funda. At dapat din pala 2 shade lighter sakin kasi nag ooxidise skin yung funda Hys! Pano ko to uubosin? 
583 2018-09-09 15:46:55 I wonder if the SEC is examining short sales of these stocks?
584 2018-09-09 15:46:08 I was wondering the same thing - perhaps someone should analyze who is buying these stocks when the price drops.  And who has short orders placed on those stocks. Someone is probably making a killing
585 2018-09-09 15:43:49 Isn't China one of those country's who can kill the US economy by dumping dept stocks on the market? And one of the only governments who have enough power over their people to ruin their economy as collateral damage and don't get flag for it.

589 2018-09-09 15:42:19 Stocks are a volatile trailing indicator. Wait for the next quarterly & annual reports. Needs more data for accuracy.
590 2018-09-09 15:42:19 I’ve said this for a month.  Hit the four or five stocks holding this market together.  Market will crumble
591 2018-09-09 15:41:32 Those of us who can't afford to buy stocks don't care if stocks are going up. We care about food, shelter, and affordable health care.
592 2018-09-09 15:41:20 The record number of airline stocks that were shorted just days before 9/11 should be proof enough. Anyone got a list of those people and who their friends are?

594 2018-09-09 15:41:19 It's great when all the organic bananas go brown and are on for half price of the normal bananas, wife stocks up for banana bread. About the only time the organic stuff in town sells when it's on a clearance discount.

598 2018-09-09 15:38:17 True. Twitter is kind of bad but its still a lot better than stocktwits. When stocks make a move everyone claims they invested and company is the next best thing. Immediately there is a little pullback they start calling for a crash. 
599 2018-09-09 15:38:16 Poor Katy...Soros is very busy apparently. BTW buying stocks and products are not the same thing
600 2018-09-09 15:37:37 Tesla stocks dropping over Elon smoking weed shows us that the stock market really shouldn't matter in the grand scheme of things.
601 2018-09-09 15:35:59 one more "to beat inflation, get a decent job or invest in stocks", i'll punch you in the mouth

get a decent job but the govt wont increase minimum wage? fuck off
602 2018-09-09 15:35:07 Bruh—I’m not here to debate weed futures with you. Point being an ad for gange stocks and pro wrestling does not scream “credible business website.”

604 2018-09-09 15:34:22 So basically, buy the titans once they do any type of dip? What’s considered a significant % drop in share price? I’m out to find a “stocks” for dummies with that kind of info
605 2018-09-09 15:33:43 It may have been a great Ploy for Elon Musk to buy back his stocks at a much lower price. In a couple weeks they'll be a lot more valuable. Most people don't give a damn about someone smoking pot only the stuffy two-faced people in the stock market.
606 2018-09-09 15:31:12 $NFLX and many other tech stocks to crash very soon. You heard it first here
607 2018-09-09 15:30:11 Elon musk smokes weed and that’s a big deal lol stocks drop and ppl think something is wrong with him. Lol so if he was smoking weed all the time that erasers everything he did? Smh this world “the matrix” is getting crazier and crazier.
608 2018-09-09 15:28:33 Wow, I was just looking at cobalt related stocks to buy. Glad that I didn't

611 2018-09-09 15:24:54 Labor & Statistics prove that you are generating less jobs in your first 18 months versus Obama's last 18 months.  Why is that?  Where's the great job creation that you promised your  tax cut would generate. Oh, taxes are going to buy back stocks, making the wealthy more wealthy.
612 2018-09-09 15:22:37 He’s sadly representing your sorry butt ! I wish only the ones who voted for him got tax cuts , jobs , booming economy, stocks , border protection , and the rest of you could live off Obama’s care :) That orange man you talk about is your President to and I know your benefiting

618 2018-09-09 15:19:04 Random question, if stocks and property enter into dump mode, what future is there for BTC and this space? How long do you see the stock market bull lasting? My concerns are that when that dumps, this space will be ultra rekt?
619 2018-09-09 15:18:10 Why Yes We Can!
620 2018-09-09 15:16:05 Y’all should have been a good partner and advised them to increase their salary cap given they replaced the kicker position with a flex position. This is like forcing me to add penny stocks to my portfolio.

651 2018-09-09 14:57:43 But Nike's stocks has risen before they jumped into the social justice bandwagon. You got the info for a 1 year spread. Plus I see a red line at the end of the photo so that means the stocks are going down. Proof that Americans are tired on corporations drinking the Kool Aid

660 2018-09-09 14:49:51 AI, Mechanization, Automation... With a little work we can prove all mediums of hyper-exchange have 0 value.

Paper money 0 value
Gold 0 value
Stocks, businesses. Corporations quite useless when all it takes to make something is electricity.
Even money can be made with electrons.
661 2018-09-09 14:49:15 Just curious, if the equity market is so bullish and the economy will be like this for much longer than people think, how come capital markets cos stocks look horrible? Leading indicator? $BLK $TROW $BEN $IVZ
662 2018-09-09 14:48:46 You suck at trading. All you trade is wanna be penny stocks. You're an trading eductor, you're an educator, not a successful trader. In fact there's a few topics in your course you don't even discuss, proving your lack of knowledge for advanced trading. I bet you lose $ trading.
663 2018-09-09 14:48:04 A lot of new followers this week, but I think many have us confused with a different publication. 

We cover state politics in Florida, not stocks and financial markets.
664 2018-09-09 14:46:45 and last time I checked; the majority of Americans do not own stocks...so please tell me where ALL Americans are feeling happiness and wealth, especially when they go to the grocery store or gas station....everything is going up and people have to choose.
665 2018-09-09 14:46:42 Sell your stocks people . ...lol
666 2018-09-09 14:46:13 Stop spreading ignorance. 
Millions of Americans own stocks directly or indirectly and the rise or the fall of the stock market effects everybody.
Almost every stocks market in the world is down for the year .
Money is coming to U.S
667 2018-09-09 14:45:58 What are you saying? I thought he had all control of the stocks!! NOT, LOL
668 2018-09-09 14:45:56 i didnt have any new stocks picture or idea for nctzen selca day hwaa
669 2018-09-09 14:45:43 Haha only joy of coming back Crewe hey!  bet she stocks up purposely when she knows you’re coming 
670 2018-09-09 14:45:39 Of course the stock market is up, you gave over a trillion dollars to corporations to buy back stocks with zero rules making them reinvest that money into their businesses. Around 4 percent of workers saw a real benefit from that, congrats from the super wealthy!
671 2018-09-09 14:45:39 Stocks are down. No one is buying or selling property. Naya Pakistan is in limbo.
672 2018-09-09 14:45:12 But Nike and Kapernick stocks are up!
673 2018-09-09 14:45:07 $10B buyback starting this month, so basically 20% of outstanding stocks.
674 2018-09-09 14:44:39 The bumpstock was honeslty his biggest issue, lol. Any good marksman knows that full auto fire is not nearly as accurate.  Plus, bump stocks are inefficient and unreliable. It's more like inconsistent burst fire at best.
675 2018-09-09 14:44:22 I do not own stocks and have a job. I travel on roads with pot holes and have not had a raise in years. Please be HONEST and address,"What has been done for We the People?" We are the base of America!
676 2018-09-09 14:44:18 Havnt heard abt crop insurance ? And when ur doing business be it.... In 2006 floods we dont get a single penny when whole shops with stocks was wash out

682 2018-09-09 14:38:29 Name one piece if legislation that has been passed by this administration to cause they things your claiming.  The unemployment, economic growth and stocks have been an upward trend since about 2015.
683 2018-09-09 14:37:56 Raising the age to buy a firearm does nothing, limiting the number of rifles you can buy in a month does nothing, making bump stocks more difficult to buy does nothing and shows ignorance of how they work. Making it more difficult to get a permit to carry only punishes law...
684 2018-09-09 14:37:20 Charts don’t lie. Ford is 40% lower from when Trump was elected. During a time US stocks have done fantastic. None of these tariffs are about better trade it’s about marektering to he base. The EU last week offered to go 0% tariffs on autos calling POTUS bluff and he rejected it.
685 2018-09-09 14:36:51 im surprised to see you believe in "cheap" "bargain" stocks tbh
686 2018-09-09 14:36:26 I don't wanna hear about no digital money or holding stocks if you can't convert your shit to cash during an emergency it's not real to me

690 2018-09-09 14:35:29 Broker - “Stocks are overpriced, but not by a lot, so based on our outlook for interest rates and other factors, they’re still a buy.”
Howard marks- My opinion’s a little different: When an asset’s overpriced, it can’t be a buy.
691 2018-09-09 14:35:02 ... and the GOP is hoping this bubble does not burst until after mid term elections. By tax time next year, a lot of Trump supporters are going to be shocked at how much further in the hole we all are. By the way, what %age of folks getting rich off stocks are actually American?

695 2018-09-09 14:32:51 Thanks Obama!  Also the stock market is not an indication of overall economic well being. Around 50% of the US has no investments in stocks. So basically this means the rich are richer.

705 2018-09-09 14:26:24 Did you know that those same stockholders were owning American stocks under Obama? Doesn’t that make it hard for HIM to take credit for today’s economy as well?
706 2018-09-09 14:25:59 Yep, why invest in the American worker when you can use the free tax money and buy more stocks. I am sure that it will trickle down to us soon
707 2018-09-09 14:25:41 Maybe they should look at their IRA's and 401Ks.  You see, there's lot of stocks in those accounts.  Oh that's right, you are the person who thinks those retirement vehicles are only for the rich.  Look at you  BOOM!

714 2018-09-09 14:23:37 I wish he had been aborted. What a travesty for our nation. We’re laughing stocks of the world. I hope the real republicans wake up soon!
715 2018-09-09 14:23:26 That's low.  Consider that the average base depth of winning stocks is 20%.  So if you hold through multiple bases, which is essential for big gains, you are going to take a dip from equity highs. I've re-defined  what constitutes a drawdown. -- only loss of equity not profit
716 2018-09-09 14:23:01 Stop touting the impact of the GOP tax sham as good for average Americans. Average wage increases at 2.7% are lower than inflation of 2.9.Corporations bought back $400B in stocks raising stock prices and dividends. These actions benefit corps and the wealthy not average Americans
717 2018-09-09 14:22:59 Stop analogizing ETH to AMZN

Stocks have recourse to cash flow. Investors ignore mr market when price falls below future CF. The lower the price, the *better* the investment

Money is only supported by holders’ subjective confidence. The lower it goes, the worse the investment
718 2018-09-09 14:22:28 Kaepernick, a bust as a quarterback... for Nike, stocks are dropping...BLM, why not black children need both parents in the household (family matters) Blacks stop pulling guns on other Blacks and Police....education, change the face of Urban America...solution vs self promotion!

724 2018-09-09 14:21:16 That's a blatant lie, as an investor your trade war (Tariffs) have caused my portfolio to lose continuously. The market is falling because of your threats of more tariffs, stocks are falling every time you attack a company. No more Tariffs. Stop the Tariffs.

729 2018-09-09 14:16:34 FACT: Worker pay in the second quarter dropped nearly one percent below its first-quarter level.

FACT: Worker wages drop while companies spend $700 billion to boost stocks

739 2018-09-09 14:08:10 I am horrible in picking tops and bottoms, but this divergence of US vs rest of the world (stocks, credits, FX, bonds) due to hawkish FED, tariff negotiations etc which currently leads to global slowdown... eventually US can't divergence forever.

741 2018-09-09 14:03:54 The stocks will all soar in a year. They'll all do good. Ditz Kellyanne Conway is the culprit. She told Trump's "enemy" newspapers her opinion, and they wrote it, with their reporter skills, to make it appear legitimate. It was Kellyanne and the reporter. She is Trump's betrayer.

782 2018-09-09 13:33:06 I do not buy stocks.
783 2018-09-09 13:32:54 You are so right. It took Trump to make the Stocks go from 20,000 to 25,000 and unemployment to go from 5 to 3.5. And it was the genius of Trump to give corporations tax cuts to buy back stocks & not give employees a raise.

But OK
784 2018-09-09 13:31:17 I remember them doing it in the ‘70s (pre-EU) and then demanding Govt subsidies when fish stocks dramatically fell because of overfishing and ‘new’ net techniques. That scandal prompted me to take an interest in Green issues, because it seemed selfish, stupid behaviour.

828 2018-09-09 12:53:11 We suffer from economic inequality. Ultra rich people fooled the moderate minded people into the idea that poor people are taking their money. The issue is the low class worker we have created that lives in squalor. People will work for $2hr if forced. Raise wages not stocks

838 2018-09-09 12:43:55 Stocks have value based on the assets, earnings and potential of the company.

917 2018-09-09 11:09:24 Portfolio can accommodate max 25 stocks with equal weight. Once the stocks in the portfolio initial stop loss is 10%. Trailing stop loss is  based on 3 parameters. But for some reason won't put it here.

Any suggestions?
924 2018-09-09 11:07:22 Try to brush it off siwbp. It happens. Setting rules and having a set exit stratergy will help. Allowing too much wiggle will hurt you long term. Maybe size down for a week while you recover your confidence. Focus on those exits and respecting stocks with range. You'll be ok. 
925 2018-09-09 11:06:44 These are not sugar/hotel stocks deepak.This are great indian consumer story have great predictability in earnings. Check the prices after 4/5 years . Other than u, in past 10 years many people criticised their valuation but they got slap on their face in every 4-5 yrs(doubled)
926 2018-09-09 11:03:08 In the lead-up[to a crash] bull markets don’t broaden,they narrow. You could have bought almost anything in 2009 and it would have gone up. Then it narrowed to just US stocks. Then it narrowed to tech. Now it’s just the Faang stocks. And at sometime they will fall over. T. Smith

929 2018-09-09 10:59:48 Remember after the Parkland shootings, Trump promised to raise the minimum age requirement to purchase a firearm from 18 to 21.  He also promised to ban bump-stocks. 

NEITHER HAS HAPPENED!

The NRA controls Trump!

TRUMP is a liar and a failure.

948 2018-09-09 10:27:58 so buying stocks in a company is similar to Student loan? Dont be short-sighted. This is simply looking at a person as a PLC and people buy shares in the said person. Only difference is the startup company will be the stock exchange

989 2018-09-09 09:13:41 Obama was successful in bringing us out of a recession & kept our economy growing every year. Trump raised our taxes and gave tax cuts to business and billionaires.

1043 2018-09-09 07:34:36 I ordered a copy from amazon a couple of weeks ago.  They emailed a few days ago to say that stocks are due in earlier than their release date.  I think the book will be refreshing and very helpful.

1056 2018-09-09 07:14:09 The month-long halts are usually reserved for the fraudulent small-caps. Chinese RTOs back in the day and guys like LFIN. BK is pretty orderly. One thing I would caution against - don't hold stocks into cancellation.
1057 2018-09-09 07:14:02 So what about the $4b overnight loss in stocks?? Or does a few brainless ignorant "activists" change that?
1058 2018-09-09 07:13:04 I know some people are worried about Nifty, bcoz SGX nifty is down 40-50 points..Trust me our jackpot stocks will fly...
1059 2018-09-09 07:12:41 I wonder what Canada thinks of holding puts in a registered account on a delisted stock if holding non-listed stocks is not allowed. Likely okay because it was previously listed and you were existing holder I think.
1060 2018-09-09 07:11:25 Wish their stocks & sales would sink... unfortunately that’s UA.
1061 2018-09-09 07:09:30 Look for legged candles on ur favorite stocks.  Stocks that move to support but close at mid or higher.  We have 401k money liquidity for the week.

1067 2018-09-09 06:57:01 If the West is broke, everyone loses. Our stock market influences the world stocks, and if we're seen to lose face, every country we owe money to also loses. Gold is ultimately just a worthless rock, all the debts are numbers in a computer, and the only thing left is
1068 2018-09-09 06:51:56 Why does the upper class own the stocks of weapon manufacturers!
1069 2018-09-09 06:51:42 My above question is confined to not only above stock but also the stocks which u r tweeted in one of ur earlier tweets.

1071 2018-09-09 06:50:58 As someone who invests in stocks, I can guarantee that I will need to pull out just before President Trump jumps out of office. 

America will die inside hard for a few years before coming back to the absolute fantastic bubble it is in now.

1074 2018-09-09 06:48:24 Online sales for the week is not an accurate or defining account of current/future sales. The stocks dropped, and that's what determines what they're worth; watch those numbers.
1075 2018-09-09 06:48:07 24% cagr of profits of a company cannot guarantee 24% cagr returns for the investors. All these stocks r well known in mkt
1076 2018-09-09 06:47:02 Joe Fraud vs @pbay08 a guy that had multiple financial designations and1000s of CE credit to his name. Joe Fraud has no Job, gets money from his parents, and is more concerned about the girls, booze and chains he is wearing on a Friday night. "Millionaire" playing 2 cent stocks!
1077 2018-09-09 06:46:32 It’s wild how people will mindlessly get involved in stocks but grimace when people mention forex trading 
1078 2018-09-09 06:46:24 India despite its strong growth is getting impacted because of this. USDINR is at historic highs of 72 and more weakness is expected. Stocks, especially Nasdaq, are seeing heavy selling. Global economic slowdown, renewed trade war risks, emerging market sell-off and
1079 2018-09-09 06:45:44 Also, the “customers” they’re losing (read: white men) are such a small margin of their target audience that it won’t hurt sales. Investors (read: white men) can sell stocks all they want but tbh in my Economic Forecast it’s a great time to buy Nike stock
1080 2018-09-09 06:44:41 Talk stocks and then you will make sense. This is like predicting some stocks will go down and some up. 100 pct that will be the case with by index

Trump’s tax cuts went to the wealthy and the corporations are buying back stocks. Economy was fine before Trump!

1119 2018-09-09 05:54:51 I agree. We need more than petitions and tweets. We need to affect $, that’s all they care about. If everyone stopped contributing to 401ks for example, even if only a month, stocks would suffer.
1120 2018-09-09 05:54:46 And the discipline to stay and build on good stocks. Wealth like water has to be allowed to flow (enjoyable cash flows) and also has to be stored (capital accretion)
1121 2018-09-09 05:54:03 Yeah I’ve checked out $LDRS before a few times. But they’re managed totally differently. 1 is a basket of stocks. The other is a (very concentrated) basket of ETFs.

1129 2018-09-09 05:37:23 I am a day trader. I know stocks. Nike lost over $4Billion. FOUR BILLION DOLLARS. A few occasional gains will not NEARLY cover their huge loss. It's going down further. Learn how to read stocks. You are a FRAUD. #VoteRepublican2018 #WalkAwayFromDemocrats
1130 2018-09-09 05:36:41 Sell off is normal profit taking, nothing to get excited about. You should be reporting Chinese stocks performance

1132 2018-09-09 05:35:32 Stocks climb a wall of worry.
1133 2018-09-09 05:32:16 Yes it may be a multi bagger in future. Though I don't hold it as I don't invest in large cap stocks.
1134 2018-09-09 05:31:25 Impact of few stocks driving the Indian #StockMarket visible even among main indices (ie #Sensex outperformed #Nifty by 4.44 percentage points).
1135 2018-09-09 05:31:22 For trading stocks, I like the RSI (relative strength index) b/c it measures overbought vs oversold.  With blue-chip stocks like Exxon or something slow-moving it is almost correct every time for finding the right time to enter.
1136 2018-09-09 05:29:34 Thanks, I made some good decisions during my career so I'm OK. Even during the economic crisis of 2008, I was stable financially in part because I didn't invest in real estate or stocks. I was more conservative.
1137 2018-09-09 05:28:18 I saw $DART had a massive selloff on stocks exchange, but it gives me bad vibes.
1138 2018-09-09 05:28:05 I had noticed central banks buying stocks. That really does seem weird. Didn't know about the gold hoarding.

What's happening with bonds, if you don't mind, in a few words?
1139 2018-09-09 05:28:05 I use TD Ameritrade right now.  If I just want to swing-trade stocks for now (I'll worry about FX later) would the THV Trix v6.01 help me with swing-trading stock or should TD Ameritrade have enough tools for trading stocks? Thanks!
1140 2018-09-09 05:26:09 Tesla stocks aren't the only thing taking a hit this week.
1141 2018-09-09 05:26:08 so Tesla stocks went down after musk was on the joe rogan podcast smoking weed ?? Wowww
1142 2018-09-09 05:23:05 A driving force of stocks is largely optimism. People think things will get better stocks go up. People think things will get worse stocks go down. It's an artificial and short thinking to look solely at stocks. Trump is hoping that's how we'll all see it too.
1143 2018-09-09 05:23:02 Defense stocks still looking pretty good with the orange baboon running things.

1152 2018-09-09 05:16:28 I knew to was savvy to invest in private prisons when Trump was elected, but I could never sleep at night knowing I was contributing to that injustice. Those stocks are up 100% since 2016. Profit and social value are often contradictory.

1166 2018-09-09 05:04:42 @instagram wtf happened to my explore page why is it only scenery photos and stocks when I've never liked posts about stuff like that???? refreshing the page does jack shit and im on the "for you" tab so like???
1167 2018-09-09 05:03:46 HALF?  I highly doubt that.  More like the 1%.  Most people can't make
ends meet, let alone invest in stocks.
1168 2018-09-09 05:02:21 @SantiagoAuFund No way US stocks rally another 18 months with financials sliding. Foreign capital will chase Treasuries, but those move inverse to stocks. Strong USD kills earnings. 2016-18 blow-off=1998-2000 blow-off. SPX patterns this year even match 2000 to the letter.
1169 2018-09-09 05:02:06 As far as I'm aware, circuit breakers are only for markets as a whole. Individual stocks can do 50% drops, albiet without shortselling on downticks. And I think decline stopped because there's still some buying interest
1170 2018-09-09 05:01:45 Friends it's the GREED in U ,which is responsible ,4 the LOSS, 90% of traders lose heavy Money in #StockMarket #HorseRacing ,my advice NEVER BUY ANY STOCKS ON HOT TIPS ,NEVER INVEST DIRECTLY IN STOCK MARKET ,if ur.a ROOKEY INVESTOR #SayNoToGambling but WHY ?
1171 2018-09-09 05:01:29 “But stocks plunge.....”
1172 2018-09-09 05:01:27 Nike stocks have gone up....They're thinking...ummmm Winning 🖒
1173 2018-09-09 05:00:01 This tweet, "RT MatanoAlbert: Bitcoin investment
#invest #wealth #stocks #money #london #uk #budget #investor #binary #investment #business #cash #resp…" hasn't been tweeted more than 2 times.
1174 2018-09-09 04:59:37 Is the news that government is planning buyback of HAL stocks is true?

Then within a year of issuing IPO @1250/- and buying at a lower price is a kind of fraud with investors and a big hurdle in privatisation in defence sector.
1175 2018-09-09 04:59:16 And look how the stocks went back up the next day.
1176 2018-09-09 04:56:36 Isn't this one only for shortselling? You can't borrow and shortsell on downticks. If you were long you could still sell. I don't deal with crap stocks that get circuit breaker'd daily, so I'd have to confirm when I get home.
1177 2018-09-09 04:54:59 All the pills I’m snorting off screen in between stocks
1178 2018-09-09 04:54:31 Then buffet and Berkshire should be expected to have taken positions in u3o8 and U stocks too?
1179 2018-09-09 04:51:03 @SantiagoAuFund OK, so you think USD rises hard (agree with that), but US stocks also rise hard due to foreign inflows. That's definitely a "this time is different" view. At current valuations, why wouldn't foreigners go into USTs rather than stocks for a currency play?
1180 2018-09-09 04:49:58 Anybody know anything about stocks and buying shares? Or does anybody use the Robinhood app? Just wanna ask some Qs
1181 2018-09-09 04:43:29 Spend less than you make. Save the difference (ideally in broad based equities or stocks). Grow that gap on both ends making more and spending less! Reliable path to independence.
1182 2018-09-09 04:41:31 Your logic made me laugh so hard. You probably think you two are the only two on the internet to trade these two stocks right.

1188 2018-09-09 04:37:08 It’s hard believe you don’t know the difference between STOCKS & internet sales. Wait what am I saying of course you DON’T!
1189 2018-09-09 04:33:38 True. Good to check stocks which keep knocking on your door. 
The ones that you aren't convinced about about but are persistent in their knocking.

1202 2018-09-09 04:21:14 The stock market did well because of 4 stocks Amazon, Apple, Facebook & Google. BTW the restrictive monetary policies of Obama's Fed. Reserve keeping interest rates  below 1.5% caused many Labor Union Pensions to lose $millions! NTM the 1.5 million Labor Union jobs lost.

1218 2018-09-09 04:07:56 Psst don’t tell them Nike stocks went up at least 30% and that veterans actually support and actually understand the protest because they aren’t closed minded morons
1219 2018-09-09 04:04:19 Stocks dropped 2 points when that was announced. And still down, but charts must lie.

1230 2018-09-09 03:49:12 An interesting thing I’ve noticed is if people open up an investing conversation with, “Did you see Apple today?!”, I feel they likely don’t know investing. No I don’t follow stocks daily. Yes you can make a killing that way but it requires in depth research and diversification.

1296 2018-09-09 02:43:07 What is shocking to me is how did he beat the S&P 500 by so much when he often had over a thousand stocks in his portfolio?
1297 2018-09-09 02:42:58 Hi! We don't have any on-hand stocks right now.
1298 2018-09-09 02:42:27 That's one big, unsubstantiated, conclusion.  Outfitters want stability.  Things like rules a full year in advance with no mid season reviews to interrupt business.  Not some magical rules where their guests can do irreversible harm to stocks.  Eyes roll.
1299 2018-09-09 02:41:43 I got OK with tax I paid so far they treat it like stocks so because I had held the majority over 1 year that I sold cgt tax was halved only paid just over 20% still terrible but better than 40
1300 2018-09-09 02:41:03 @sonicmerlin on robinhood, they have new group search where you can just click a category, and it pulls a list of all stocks matching.
1301 2018-09-09 02:40:21 How or where do i trade penny stocks?
1302 2018-09-09 02:40:10 @jack Hey man! Just started out my portfolio with a few dozen twitter stocks! Thank you for providing a great social media platform!
1303 2018-09-09 02:39:49 If sales and stocks keep going up like they have, you are and have been, in all ways, wrong wrong wrong. Even you know this and it annoys you because it means, currently, you are losing this argument.
1304 2018-09-09 02:38:46 STOCKS with some elite football mind action there. However, need to show that Green will eventually throw in the wildcat, which I think they will when B1G play comes around
1305 2018-09-09 02:38:36 What you're suggesting would basically lead to a regime were people could pay to circumvent salmon rules all anglers are subject to. Once you start carving out exceptions camps would demand higher and higher access. It's completely unfair and would lead to more pressure on stocks
1306 2018-09-09 02:35:53 Stocks was the suggestion I gathered....
1307 2018-09-09 02:31:59 agreed
1308 2018-09-09 02:31:57 Of all the above stocks Maruti and Ashok Leyland looks very week....

Leyland cannot give a breakout and Maruti cannot stop in the slide...

1316 2018-09-09 02:26:03 It’s a US based regulated exchange that is the fastest growing.   Not some punk on the street.  Been using them for stocks forever.  Robinhood is just fine
1317 2018-09-09 02:25:50 People always like "easy formulas" for everything including stock market investing:
One such formula (but this kind of opportunity available only once in 5 or 7 years, in big market crash)
- Wait for big market crash
- Buy basket of stocks(15-20)
- Choose only market leaders.
1318 2018-09-09 02:25:12 One says fake one says real, doesn't matter. There are laws in this country.

1320 2018-09-09 02:24:11 Hey @Nike, the cops killed this year sacrificed everything. Care to tell them how you support a cop hater & still hope to gain the loyalty & support of Americans & people world wide? By the way, we will make sure what you did go international & watch your stocks tumble!
1321 2018-09-09 02:22:07 we need to invest in tylenol stocks
1322 2018-09-09 02:20:30 Elon says and does both smart and dumb things at convenient intervals to manipulate stocks.

1325 2018-09-09 02:16:38 That theory says reducing business, trade and investment costs are the best way to increase growth. Investors buy more companies or stocks. Banks increase business lending. Owners invest in their operations and hire workers.

1329 2018-09-09 02:10:00 Yes, and I hope their stocks keep going down.
1330 2018-09-09 02:08:17 Trump seems less regulating than Obama. Record stocks, record low unemployment amongst minorities, manufacturing jobs returning, tax cuts and Xmas bonuses. Where’s the actual darkness? Remove Trump, you get Pence. Are you sure you’ve thought it through?
1331 2018-09-09 02:08:11 i’m offended
1332 2018-09-09 02:05:31 you realize stocks aren’t sales, right
1333 2018-09-09 02:02:56 Their stocks keep going up

1336 2018-09-09 01:59:09 Because steaming is free and Nike stuff is at half price as stores dump their product stocks.
1337 2018-09-09 01:58:42 They are the laughing stocks of the entire world.
1338 2018-09-09 01:57:37 No it’s not, their stocks are plummeting!! Consumers drive the market... not their advertisers!!
1339 2018-09-09 01:54:12 And all the people talking about their stocks going down that one day are omitting the fact that the whole market went down and everyone lost money that day..how’s it been since then?
1340 2018-09-09 01:53:54 I've noticed that you work more with 6hr charts in crytpo but used the 4hr charts more in penny stocks. Um guessing that's cause the 6hr is a better Indicator being that crytpo don't sleep
1341 2018-09-09 01:52:43 The federal government, net spending is recorded as deficit (normally) or surplus. Spending - Taxes.

“SO HOW ABOUT THOSE STOCKS”
1346 2018-09-09 01:48:50 Ya, I know what you mean about the restaurant space. I have my main holdings and have other stocks that are kind of like swing trades. 15% and out. That’s the plan at least. Doesn’t always work out.
1347 2018-09-09 01:47:50 But their stocks declined and they lost millions - only slight bump from liberals but long term sorry Charlie
1348 2018-09-09 01:45:59 Simple. Owned all the stocks

1351 2018-09-09 01:43:46 stocks rise by 1%.
1352 2018-09-09 01:43:41 84% of all stocks owned by Americans belong to the wealthiest 10% of households.   

“For the vast majority of Americans, fluctuations in the stock market have relatively little effect on their wealth, or well-being, for that matter,” said Edward N. Wolff, an economist at NYU.
1353 2018-09-09 01:43:16 i guess! i’ve been there for 3 years and only make $2.25 more than when i started. but i can make a lot in stocks if i stay but i’m quitting this shit after college

1356 2018-09-09 01:36:58 Why Seeking Alpha is not under the radar of the SEC too? So many fake and real accounts promoting fraudulent stocks, failing to disclose compensation or real interests.
1357 2018-09-09 01:35:54 @Nike officials acknowledge stocks trading below 81.10 buy price but buzz since the 3rd of September is giving @Nike $164,000,000.00 in free advertising. Saying "Comparable trade off" long term investors should not worry says CAO.

1359 2018-09-09 01:33:16 My only problem with options is you have to be right too many times! With stocks you only need to be right once! With options you have to pick the right strike, expiration, call, or put! Damn!
1360 2018-09-09 01:33:00 At this early stage bitcoin is a fantastic investment. Once it matures & the price stabilises then stocks will offer relatively higher returns again. Buy bitcoin haha

1362 2018-09-09 01:32:21 Ben Graham’s whole book is about value investing and we know in bull market value is hard to find. In bear market everything is at rock bottom prices and looks like value buying, so we need peter lynch’s principle of diversification of stocks of companies whose products we use.₹

1370 2018-09-09 01:27:04 My baseball expertise says Knebel was bored and wanted guys on base. He’s a big fan of @espnhomer and his extra inning idea of putting a runner in scoring position to start off the inning.
1371 2018-09-09 01:23:33 Portfolio down 3% this week. Will regroup and back at it next week. #postivevibesonly #DayTrading #stocks #RobinHood #rt
1372 2018-09-09 01:17:50 But their stock price dropped from $93 a share to current price of $80. Online sales might be up, but their stocks took a huge beating.

1381 2018-09-09 01:13:16 Don’t let them slow you down sir, with the drop of your stocks, I’m going to make a ton off their stupidity.
1382 2018-09-09 01:13:12 easy to have an opinion on it. But it’s a guess at best..its really tough to answer that even for stocks (for which we have ALOT more historical data on)
1383 2018-09-09 01:11:53 Awe thanks it's really true--- my elbows hurt badly whenever i lift anything now. I was climbing on scaffolding for an extreme mansion for one old man who created some form of penny stocks in the 1980s and laundered the profits in Bermuda. 15,000 square feet and 10 fireplaces.

Then we will see what happens to that smug little man!!!
1393 2018-09-09 01:00:32 Still not over the fact that my parents told me to put my stocks in “robot sex dolls and weed”

Okay, plenty of cultures have recipes and dishes integral to preserving their history that include meat or fish stocks, etc...

Equating eating meat to people marrying kids is disingenuous.
1400 2018-09-09 00:50:39 I seem to remember in the depths of 2008/2009 I saw clients selling blue chip stocks because they were forced into “sell what you can not what you want to” due to the illiquidity outside the big caps. If there is such a thing as a final capitulation could we see this in crypto?
1401 2018-09-09 00:50:23 Speaking of but I hear horseshoe crab blood is worth a shitload of money. Burger should be all over this.

1402 2018-09-09 00:49:35 Tesla has yet to make any profits on their Model 3, Musk falsely accused a man of being a pedophile multiple times, smoking weed is not the issue it's his unprofessionalism that he's putting out there. If stocks fall below 250 loans will be called in and there will be problems.

1404 2018-09-09 00:49:07 All of them are complicit and spineless. Not a damn one will do anything to stop this as long as they get their tax cuts, dividends on their stocks, and their lower inheritance taxes. Oh and take away any social program or healthcare care access for all of the 99.% @GOP
1405 2018-09-09 00:46:07 Usually people that feel this way don't have stocks. They are recipients.

Loved the podcast though.

1412 2018-09-09 00:39:20 More than 20 stocks is diworsification. If your 60-70% portfolio is not invested in 5-6 stocks, then go with mutual funds.
1413 2018-09-09 00:39:16 The Nike video is all about sports....cleverly hiding the fact that MILLIONS of cops, soldiers, & regular Americans who buy NIKE feel betrayed.

It's all about money, once again. By the way, how do we know CEOs didn't short their stocks? And are making triple the dividends?

1416 2018-09-09 00:36:45 @TheNoahRing 
Choose high quality stocks with a stable management and strong balance sheet.  A good paying dividend also a plus.
1417 2018-09-09 00:36:23 Given the abundance of mismanagement and failure to protect stocks in this province's history it's nice to see DFO taking proactive steps. They could gamble but better to be cautious.

1420 2018-09-09 00:33:10 To ignore the financial science over last 30yrs that’s discovered several factors beyond the market factor? Yeah, that’s antiquated. Try living thru another 2000-2009 w/the total market index & having $0.91 left because large growth stocks stalled. You’re disclosing that, right?
1421 2018-09-09 00:32:37 If sales and stocks keep going up like they have, you are and have been, in all ways, wrong wrong wrong.

1429 2018-09-09 00:26:13 Just about all the major stocks lost value that day.  Do you even know about stock markets? Up and down all the time.  I invested about 6 months ago.  I have exactly the same amount today ss I did then. Stock markets have not been good.
1430 2018-09-09 00:25:38 Overheated? What does that mean? It means it’s unemployment is shrinking, wages rising @ 2.9% pa, interest rates rising, record coy profit reports. All world stock markets in retreat except US stocks. But, as it is world wide, debt has ballooned.

1433 2018-09-09 00:24:44 I've built up a proportionally large weighting - like really large weighting - in gold stocks this past month - in the face of the worst sentiment out there except for emerging markets. Am I clever? Not yet.  :)
1434 2018-09-09 00:23:49 Should have said "asset inflation," above, as the effect applies to stocks, and investment assets more broadly.

As far as I can tell, much of the GDP growth since Trump took office is in stock inflation, not in human prosperity.

For all the boasting, job/GDP growth have slowed.
1435 2018-09-09 00:22:30 Buy alcohol stocks on Monday.
1436 2018-09-09 00:22:04 The @globeandmail take on $NKE & $GOOS this week is somewhat aggressive. What kind of performance exactly would one expect from $GOOS during the summer months? #investing #stocks
1437 2018-09-09 00:21:53 Fucked around and bought some nike stocks lmao
1438 2018-09-09 00:20:59 Nike stocks have risen by over 30 percent.  I realize you are too uneducated to understand that that is a positive for Nike but thought I would explain it to you any way since you probably get all your info from watching FOX in your trailer lol
1439 2018-09-09 00:20:39 BUT...this time is different!!!! I mean right!?!? No really...this time...it is different!!!  No!  This time is not different! Like all other overvalued, “in the news every day” glorified stocks of the past this one too will run into trouble. They all, always do!
1440 2018-09-09 00:19:22 Stocks - S&P Falls on Tech Retreat as Trump's New Tariffs Threaten Apple.  Apple save yourself, gave Trump shares in your company. He already don't like Gay folks.
1441 2018-09-09 00:16:59 Artbox in Covent Garden stocks tiny Japanese kitkats and I’m lying in bed wishing I’d been brave enough to buy the rum & raisin.
1442 2018-09-09 00:15:27 Excellent list of mj and hemp stocks! 
FRLF is my main stock!
1443 2018-09-09 00:15:05 Of course...all this means is that private prison stocks are going to rise....I do like the gesture, don't get me wrong...good for her.

1445 2018-09-09 00:12:46 Nike stocks are up. They are making more money since the Kaepernick ads. So........no.
1446 2018-09-09 00:11:53 Stocks ate down. And don't know kolons message because he keeps changing it.
1447 2018-09-09 00:11:22 Zack getting 3-0'd with two 2 stocks by kels is triggering my confirmation bias pretty hard rn

1449 2018-09-09 00:10:52 84% of all stocks owned by Americans belong to the wealthiest 10% of households.   

“For the vast majority of Americans, fluctuations in the stock market have relatively little effect on their wealth, or well-being, for that matter,” said Edward N. Wolff, an economist at NYU.
1450 2018-09-09 00:09:22 I agree with your three replies. I liken it to Trump driving the US  Truck towards the Chinese  Truck in a defiant game of chicken. Who will swerve first? I don’t want to find out, but do you want to be exposed and vulnerable? Sell your stocks at nearly-all-time-highs.
1451 2018-09-09 00:08:46 And the truth about stocks is right now the price is being propped up by unusually high numbers of stock buy backs that Corp are spending their tax cut windfall on. Call it the fake stock market numbers.
1452 2018-09-09 00:08:25 All Chinese stocks are in mess right now. 
1453 2018-09-09 00:05:57 This makes me want to buy Tesla stocks
1454 2018-09-09 00:05:32 No. The infuriating thing is that, while #BarackObama is a master orator and coalition ass-kisser, he had 8 years to make the position I embrace as law and he didn't do a damn thing except pass #Obamacare that saw health insurance industry stocks soar after passage.
1455 2018-09-09 00:02:08 Just took a look at @SesoHQ's new pack (Align) and won't lie I should have sold it for much more than 6$ it has amazing stocks and brushes that I will defiantly use.
1456 2018-09-09 00:02:00 Funny how brave they are with just PAKs while Twice have PAKs, 4 million album sales, daesangs, impact, longevity and the ability to get JYPE's stocks to soar with the mere mention of their achievements within 3 years. Meh. WE don't want THEM more like it.
1457 2018-09-09 00:02:00 Y’all niggas need to start investing in stocks. Hop on this wave.
1458 2018-09-09 00:01:53 !  Come on,it all over the news how much sales are up. Stocks rebounded and are up.
1459 2018-09-08 23:58:23 Hey Eric remind me again who was prexy when the Parkland students were killed? Also who was prexy when Paddock killed 58 & wounded over 500 in Las Vegas?
And what prexy who always brags about how much he gets done HASN'T BANNED BUMP STOCKS YET?

1469 2018-09-08 23:50:37 Sales and stocks being up isn't wrong, dipshit. I think that might be the dumbest thing you've said so far. Lol.
1470 2018-09-08 23:50:26 but that 6% drop in Tesla stocks tho 
1471 2018-09-08 23:50:05 I have to admit, a Franken - Trump election would take #realitywhitehouse to a whole new level. Popcorn stocks would be the hottest investment of the year.
1472 2018-09-08 23:49:53 Please dont do Anything which make Tesla's stocks goes down. We have lot more expectations from u and Tesla
1473 2018-09-08 23:48:26 Idk the oilfeild is doing good and unemployment is down while the stocks are up. I don't see anything wrong.
1474 2018-09-08 23:47:33 What's wrong with their stocks
1475 2018-09-08 23:46:58 Shouldn't be too expensive. I know I have to look on ebay or Amazon now since nowhere local stocks them anymore
1476 2018-09-08 23:45:31 The sales is a false indicator. School starting back & what not. Stocks down can trigger a kind of avalanche effect. Not good.
1477 2018-09-08 23:45:05 Do you see this as likely having a knock-on effect on investor psychology? TSLA has in many ways been poster-child for cycle's love affair with money-losing, "disruptive" hope stocks. Seeing it crash and burn should be a wake-up call, esp. with stuff like FB and NFLX stumbling.

1497 2018-09-08 23:43:48 WHITE PARTY stocks climb despite troubling geopolitical headlines
1498 2018-09-08 23:43:38 IF the rest of the faanmg stocks start rolling over (fb already has) it would be very difficult for the market to keep rising
1499 2018-09-08 23:43:08 Take Willie Nelson brand as an example. Stuff going for $50 -$60 an eighth while premium stuff on same street going for $25-$35. No different than the stocks.
1500 2018-09-08 23:40:53 stick to stocks merk
1501 2018-09-08 23:40:45 I guess @realDonaldTrump got stocks in  racism is real ppl cheaters cheater!! You didn’t win @Naomi_Osaka_ @serenawilliams your still and always will be the best!!! It’s a shame how racism spilled into sports 
1502 2018-09-08 23:40:10 Of course, Junior Mint, the stock market is higher b/c Obama resurrected it from failed Bush policies. Not every1 owns stocks. The wealthy, you & the #TrumpCrimeFamily, received Million$ w/new Tax reforms.  Middle, poor Americans got nothing. Cost of living is up. Wages are not!
1503 2018-09-08 23:40:07 Bro the internet is hypocrit af. How come weed smokers out there didn’t come out together to support our bro when he needs it? A campaign like “my stocks are low, bjt I’m proudly high” or something?
1504 2018-09-08 23:40:07 I gave up on alt season. 

Cannabis stocks the future! ...
1505 2018-09-08 23:38:33 When more and more short setups start failing, and quickly, the market's telling you that your thesis is wrong and to revisit it.

We've been seeing a shift in Nifty Commodities, Metals, and Infrastructure Index stocks over the last few months. From downtrends to sideways.
1506 2018-09-08 23:38:14 You forgot the most important channel: STOCKS!!
1507 2018-09-08 23:38:10 Market is being propped up by the fed. Casino stocks get hit first.
1508 2018-09-08 23:32:40 Odd, cause I can think of a diet that gives people year after year the longest lifespans on the planet... a Japanese diet. Which not only includes meat, but all sorts of animal derived products in all their stocks, etc... you’d be wildly ignorant to call that diet “unhealthy.”
1509 2018-09-08 23:31:27 Look at all the CEOs of companies who sold millions of dollars of their stocks in their own companies after it was announced that the companies would be buying back their own stock. Can you blame them? No, but the laws need to be changed.    @freespeechtv #RickShow
1510 2018-09-08 23:31:05 People need to stop comparing Amazon or any other tech stock to crypto. Those stocks have fundamentals and working products/businesses behind them. Crypto has almost nothing but speculation and manipulation. (Don't like this comment @APompliano if you won't respond).

1512 2018-09-08 23:28:29 @elonmusk you should definitely invest in marijuana stocks maybe $CRON
1513 2018-09-08 23:27:10 Hey whatever, all I know is stocks are up and sales are up. All good so far. Anything else isn't based on data, just gut feelings.
1514 2018-09-08 23:25:40 Just wanna say this. The people who sold stocks are the same people who are going to buy them all back at a lower price. They know how the game is played, and they know that idiots will panic sell after seeing something like that. Also, it's a non issue, being blown up for clicks

1516 2018-09-08 23:20:42 My best #trading education came from bear markets & 2007/2008 were exceptional years for that (#indices, #stocks & #forex). 
$Crypto large caps are all in a Bear Market & if you are a #hodler, this will be hurting - but very valuable market education.

1520 2018-09-08 23:17:55 Somewhere around 2002 we stopped replenishing public housing stocks to meet needs. Ever walk around Kitsilano and realise just how many Co-ops are there built in the 80s & 90s? Even some BC Housing.
We lost our way for a bit while some people had their snout in the #vanre trough.
1521 2018-09-08 23:17:45 Not sustainable, retail investors don't look at market cap, just see a penny stock and hope it will be the next Canopy Growth at 60.00 a share. Not realizing it is now worth as much as some of the biggest cannabis stocks....remember when WEED became the first UNICORN? same same
1522 2018-09-08 23:17:44 as @MichaelAvenatti says Buckle up Butterup!.....
Karma is coming for you...nice distraction but I will pay extra for Apple stocks are down that means you are going down so I will take the hit! @GOP @CNN @FoxNews
1523 2018-09-08 23:17:28 And if a JSE me say me know bout stocks ... tell Wall Street that I’m coming soon. @ChronixxMusic #WallStreet #WhereICome
1524 2018-09-08 23:17:13 Online sales up 31%.  You know nothing about business.  When stocks are down, it's buy, buy, buy!!  A win for Nike and a win for investors.  Thanks jockstraps!!  #BurnBabyBurn #HeReallyDoesLoveTheUneducated
1525 2018-09-08 23:16:33 Sold my stocks lmao idgaf 
IM INVESTING IN MYSELFFFFF
1526 2018-09-08 23:15:07 Oh good, bring up @Nike. Their stocks have already surged. I'm sure they'll thank you later. 
#justdoit
1527 2018-09-08 23:13:48 heard movement outside my house at night. I don't think people realize how far gone America was before Trump stepped in. I live in a Town that HELL built. They stole over $200,000 from my moms stocks. Mom passed last summer. i'm a witness, they want me gone!
1528 2018-09-08 23:11:54 Go pick the right stocks. Mone double in 12 mths.
1529 2018-09-08 23:10:16 They lost $4 billion in stocks lol
1530 2018-09-08 23:10:01 If you had bought the first S&P 500 Index Fund so and so many years ago, people would say, you'd be x amount rich from #stocks. 

But, what if you used the same math on #cryptocurrency?
1531 2018-09-08 23:09:38 I’m interested in starting some stocks  that’s where the money at fr
1532 2018-09-08 23:07:36 I'm still wondering, y'all getting paid to make all these memes? Offered some stocks in their company? Offered a employment position?
1533 2018-09-08 23:06:06 Yeah. But you left out how their stocks dropped by like 38%. The boycott, no matter how fucking stupid it is, is actually working. No one wants to invest in Nike right now because the situation is volatile. Its why you arent supposed to attach a brand to politics.
1534 2018-09-08 23:05:51 @DavidDobrik so nows probably a good time to buy some @Tesla stocks right? #420elon #420VlogSquad
1535 2018-09-08 23:04:29 street stocks. watch out because they slide a lot. Legends are eh. Late models take skill, and survival.
1536 2018-09-08 23:04:11 Also, the GDP is not an example of how the average person is doing. Remember, most people can't play with stocks, bonds or real estate. Food, shelter and healthcare shouldn't just be for the players
1537 2018-09-08 23:02:45 CARS Tour opening ceremonies is underway from Orange County Speedway.

The Late Model Stocks race first and then the Super Late Models.
1538 2018-09-08 23:02:28 Do you think India’s crop/stocks are overstated by 3 million bales?
1539 2018-09-08 23:02:09 You have not seen me 'rugsweeping' or denying anything.

But you have seen me having mercy on someone that did wrong, respecting the victim's wishes and trying to keep a company out of image trouble.

If you know anything about stocks and reputation you should understand.
1540 2018-09-08 23:01:12 that may be the case, but chinese stocks going to the moon soon
1541 2018-09-08 22:59:46 This song is approriate cuz it's what you're gonna hear when I'm sharking for your stocks 
1542 2018-09-08 22:59:28 NIKE’s STOCKS WENT UP 31% 
1543 2018-09-08 22:58:21 What, hes got a small dick? Don't care.  My stocks are up, I can quite my job and find a hirer paying one if  I wanted to, not worried about WW3, less worried about ISIS and I feel much better about America's future for all.
1544 2018-09-08 22:58:17 Nikes Stocks went up 31%
1545 2018-09-08 22:58:10 Next year I am going to open a portfolio and buy some stocks, by the time I'm 50 hopefully the stocks I bought will triple in price.
1546 2018-09-08 22:58:04 2008 was just pure fraud, 2018 bit froffy , but are the fundamentals off those 6 stocks pretty solid, also JPM, GS,  6 ish *eps SIG hitting it out the park for a reason HD out the park, S&P 4K within 2years if you don’t keep talking it down.
What say you @JoeSquawk
1547 2018-09-08 22:57:11 There are safe stocks that cost $7 a share and pay 10% annual dividends
1548 2018-09-08 22:56:48 Anyone can buy stocks, it's not just Wallstreet executives. People say companies only care about shareholders, you yourself can become a shareholder. A share is a stock.
1549 2018-09-08 22:56:29 Round 1: I lost 2 stocks, you lost 1 = I wasn’t bodied
Round 2: I lost 1 stock, you lost 2 = I wasn’t bodied
Round 3: I lost 2 stocks, you lost 0 = I was bodied
Being bodied is complete loss
That didn’t exactly happen
1550 2018-09-08 22:56:28 Great! So the NRA is now in favor of closing the gun show and online loopholes, banning military-style assault weapons and bump stocks, and supporting increased requirements on background checks on anyone seeking to purchase a gun?
1551 2018-09-08 22:56:12 They lost Monday 3 billion in stocks.

1553 2018-09-08 22:54:35 More average people need to hop on the stock market. Don't waste your money on expensive clothes, spend it on stocks that can grow and double your money.

1565 2018-09-08 22:39:02 as soon as people get over elon hitting a joint, which they will because it's stupid, stocks will go up and you'll profit
1566 2018-09-08 22:38:42 Maybe you're being scouted for the majors and just don't realize it yet.  Make sure Rita stocks up on the Ben Gay!!!!!
1567 2018-09-08 22:37:43 Not surprising, but also not the whole picture. Stocks took a hit, and this is only the first week. We don't know how this is going to end.
1568 2018-09-08 22:36:34 Stocks are down
1569 2018-09-08 22:35:33 Clearly you know nothing about stocks. Study up and learn the significance of market cap. Good luck.
1570 2018-09-08 22:34:30 Elon Musk is already a multi-billionaire. Losing that in the stocks is not ideal but he will not struggle by any means because of it
1571 2018-09-08 22:34:17 It's feature time! First up is the 4 fun division followed by the outlaw and then the 75 lap David Lambe Memorial for the street stocks. We have 5 laps left in the 4 fun race the 59 is leading
1572 2018-09-08 22:28:30 How many people find oil on their property? Sell $90k in stocks in 1 year? 56% finding their way to the top 10% one way or another sounds really dynamic to me. More dynamic than say, utopian Denmark.
1573 2018-09-08 22:27:23 It’s funny because they saw a rise in people buying and holding on to stocks, especially among millennials who can actually change the course of the future.  The sell off was something like 12%. Losses were pretty much on par with loss percentage of all stocks the past week. MAGA
1574 2018-09-08 22:26:52 If anyone is interested in getting into stocks and investing, let me know, I can send you an invite for the Robinhood app and we can both get a free stock
1575 2018-09-08 22:26:05 The stocks were already falling
1576 2018-09-08 22:24:31 Time for everyone to dump all stocks and shares in all MS social media, perhaps that will knock some sense into these CEO's heads.
1577 2018-09-08 22:23:53 I’m trying to get into investing too. Stocks are pretty risky but i would love to watch my money grow.
1578 2018-09-08 22:20:43 @elonmusk is ur episode with @joerogan part of ur scheme to take @Tesla private? Not buying it broam keeping my tesla stocks.
1579 2018-09-08 22:19:42 I think he's purposely trying to lower the value because he knows all tech stocks are overvalued.
1580 2018-09-08 22:17:19 Instinet is in them they ran some stocks hard last year and then they tumbled even harder anything i see them@in that has a gain i start scaling out
1581 2018-09-08 22:17:16 Chai latte stocks may be impacted. I'd panic too.
1582 2018-09-08 22:14:39 We know how eager you are to get the OnePlus Bullets Wireless, Chinna and we'd like to let you know that we are working on it. Since we cannot provide you any specific timeframe, you may select "Notify Me" on the order page to receive an email once stocks are back.
1583 2018-09-08 22:14:38 When will your die stocks be refilled?
1584 2018-09-08 22:14:26 How many stocks did you identify which were worth taking a look and moved 45% in a couple of months?
1585 2018-09-08 22:12:38 Investing in stocks, crypto isn’t as stressful when I know I’ll always have other sources of income
1586 2018-09-08 22:11:45 During BO’s 96 mos in office, the median jobless rate was 7.7%. The highest for any admin since WWII. 
Food Stamp recipients were up 33%.
Home Ownership down 4%.
On 11/2/16 the Dow was at 17,888.28
On 11/22/16 the Dow hit 19,000.00. All major stocks went up due 2 Clinton’s defeat
1587 2018-09-08 22:11:42 New stocks once again!

1589 2018-09-08 22:09:57 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
1590 2018-09-08 22:09:22 The company has low earnings so the stock isn’t going to grow. If you bought them 10 years ago thats a different story. Buying stocks because the CEO is cool is a terrible financial decision. You wasted your money.
1591 2018-09-08 22:09:13 dont know any of these newfangled ultra beets... a Purple ? Stocks and shares ? A fucking cloun? A god damn cloun?
1592 2018-09-08 22:08:14 I think it's stupid that the stocks fell. It is really sad that one thing like that can effect your business. Smoking a joint doesn't change all the accomplishments of Elon Musk. Small minded people.
1593 2018-09-08 22:07:21 Profits are up for those with stocks. Ain't shit for those with a light bill.
1594 2018-09-08 22:07:09 Nike stocks soaring?
1595 2018-09-08 22:06:36 Are the US Distros in danger of not getting any stocks of Policenauts?
1596 2018-09-08 22:05:52 Really?  Under Obama, he saved the US economy from the ruins left by Bush/GOP, he ended costly GOP wars, he got Bin Ladin, he had the Iranians gave up their Nukes, over 75 mos positive jobs added, stocks increased by 180%, 12 million jobs added, unemployment down, etc.....

1599 2018-09-08 22:03:09 Yeah but he used to own like several hundred stocks.
1600 2018-09-08 22:02:46 True, but 

Accumulating bitcoin > accumulating growth stocks 
1601 2018-09-08 22:00:51 I'm 24 and for the past two years have started investing in stocks. I played the short term goal-penny stocks- lost hard. 90% of prob $2,000 (not easy losing that after earning it through hard work). My strategy now- really believing in a long term picture of a company.
1602 2018-09-08 22:00:23 It's not just CEOs, it's the rich 5% of our country that hides behind the stocks and OWNS those companies. It's those greedy fucks that don't understand $ is a TOOL and when they hoard it they only hurt our economy!
1603 2018-09-08 21:58:36 Yo entre lunes y salto stop el martes... Se queda en vigilancia a ver si la próxima es la buena
1604 2018-09-08 21:58:08 Stopped out with a 1.35 cents a pound for Oct. live Cattle on short position. Livestock too choppy now-waiting-also for oct. Hogs. Very bearish on the indexes as the Trade War could escalate into a 1930 style depression, only worse! #Commodities #Agriculture #TradeWar #Stocks
1605 2018-09-08 21:57:39 The times to be aware of volume in neutral stocks are when there is a large increase in volume as the stock nears an important level of support or resistance. #tasi
1606 2018-09-08 21:57:04 Bravest man I know. He walks into danger so many times a day plus takes all of the crap from stupid people, people, many who are blasting trump while counting all the money from their rise in stocks.
1607 2018-09-08 21:54:44 There’s a bill in Congress that won’t move banning bump stocks. Literally no one has come out in favor of bump stocks, not even the NRA. Yet, they want us to believe one associate justice is going to change major legislation in which public opinion agrees...I find it insulting.
1608 2018-09-08 21:54:26 @TuckerCarlson Nike Stock is up 31% because of the message!! Whatsamatter you? You don’t want the stocks to rise?  Hmm. Are you now, or have you ever been a Socialist? #Resistance #TrumpLiesMatter
1609 2018-09-08 21:51:09 Did you hear how Tesla's stocks dropped hella cuz of this 
1610 2018-09-08 21:50:27 That’s cause the dumb shits think a $3 dip per share is significant  & im 18 and got stocks too so dont @ me
1611 2018-09-08 21:49:40 Good stocks are not necessary good deals.
1612 2018-09-08 21:49:21 If Tesla defaults now, it could be called forever as the start of one of the biggest stock market crashs ever. I am sure a $50b bankruptcy would cause some revaluation of other stocks too. Fund managers would sell other stocks to cover fund profits before year end
1613 2018-09-08 21:49:01 Or you can have the guy that stocks the shelves with the eggs to sort them out before putting them on the shelves. Leave the bad ones in the  back. Then there will only be all good eggs on the shelves.
1614 2018-09-08 21:48:54 Stacking My Money Invest Ina Stocks @ygAddie
1615 2018-09-08 21:46:40 Need to invest in these stocks
1616 2018-09-08 21:46:37 Nike stocks and sales are soaring.

 Your podcast is declining.

See a trend ?
1617 2018-09-08 21:45:08 I don't know why he trusts them, nobody else does
1618 2018-09-08 21:42:10 Stocks
1619 2018-09-08 21:42:10 The recovery started on November 2016 when @POTUS became President. Stocks started to soar!  #MAGA
1620 2018-09-08 21:41:18 大坂優勝！！
1621 2018-09-08 21:36:58 Also, look at the growth if gaming worldwide. Gaming stocks on fire. Msft getting deeper into gaming. Fortnite just a massive game.
1622 2018-09-08 21:36:53 Make it quick. Limited stocks available.
1623 2018-09-08 21:36:16 Stocks plummeted but okay
1624 2018-09-08 21:35:30 セレナ何怒り？ラケット壊してゲームペナルティ？？

何はともあれ、あと一ゲーム！
1625 2018-09-08 21:32:47 I think it is. Numerous ones posted TDA didn't allow the purchase. Etrade is about as flexible as can be for penny stocks. I've yet to run into one over the 19 years I've been with them that they wouldn't allow a person to buy.
1626 2018-09-08 21:32:39 @TuckerCarlson Nike Stock is up 31% because of the message!! Whatsamatter with you? don’t want the stocks to rise? Hmm. Are you now, or have you ever been a Socialist? #Resistance #TrumpLiesMatter
1627 2018-09-08 21:32:17 Thanks for the spelling lesson. I type on on a phone. It that the only thing you can talk about? What other stocks do you like?
1628 2018-09-08 21:30:59 Stocks are up let me ask you this are you going to refuse the money you are making off these stocks? Are you going to refuse the pay increase? Whine all you want our President is doing a fabulous job despite the fake news trying to hamper him in any way they can think of pathetic
1629 2018-09-08 21:30:51 @TuckerCarlson Nike Stock is up 31% because of the message!! Whatsamatter with you? don’t want the stocks to rise? Hmm. Are you now, or have you ever been a Socialist? #Resistance #TrumpLiesMatter

1632 2018-09-08 21:28:07 You’re trying to correlate a very separate conversation with the point I’m making. It doesn’t work like that. Stocks don’t work like that. And your definition of “plummet” is subjective
1633 2018-09-08 21:27:49 BTC and crypto is young man's game, and the old folks play with stocks and etf's, futures etc. Are we really witnessing our parents/ an older generation actually fuck us over?I thought they were here to help us succeed, be a guidance?I guess greed knows no boundaries. True colors

1637 2018-09-08 21:26:20 NIKE STOCKS ROSE 31%

1638 2018-09-08 21:25:51 Nike Stock is up 31% because of the message!! Whatsamatter with you? don’t want the stocks to rise? Hmm. Are you now, or have you ever been a Socialist?
1639 2018-09-08 21:25:19 Visiting an evil villain's lair and seeing stocks + a loan application site on his multiple monitors is pretty great.
1640 2018-09-08 21:25:13 Nike stocks rose 31% so much for your  dumb thinking!!
1641 2018-09-08 21:24:19 Jack Black on the Jonathan Ross show  just now. I met him once. Stocks Restaurant, Mcr 2007. His bowels were moving in the gents for all to hear. I was in earshot. As we exited I “encouraged”him to say hello to our table. I confess I was in drink & I think I frightened him.
1642 2018-09-08 21:24:12 No body is pumping any stock.  And, all stocks will not be lifted equally.  What Katusa, Bannerman CEO Munroe, and GoviEX CEO Major and many are saying is that the US producers due to the S232 will be propelled far more than others.  This will result in a multi tier pricing
1643 2018-09-08 21:24:06 Conserve fish stocks while fishetmen get poorer.
1644 2018-09-08 21:23:57 As someone who has seen stocks go both up, and down, and who worked in banking and knows that many folks have small 401ks or no 401k, I know that stocks are NOT the economy.  
Stocks are educated gambling, and investors are mostly there short term.
1645 2018-09-08 21:23:56 Nike stocks rose 31% so much for you and your dads dumb thinking!!
1646 2018-09-08 21:22:24 The Jensen and Dylon Joint co. We do stocks. We also make joints.
1647 2018-09-08 21:21:37 I was thinking daisies or bump stocks
1648 2018-09-08 21:20:22 Beautiful wedding at Goldsborough Hall today for the lovely Maddy and Chris. Scented roses, freeshias and stocks filled this stunning venue.
1649 2018-09-08 21:18:40 I imagine their stocks have plummeted as a result of my misfortune. Save Cawston’s!
1650 2018-09-08 21:18:18 Then I'm an epic failure with my diversified, high-growth portfolio. On stocks, some have done well, but not equivalent. Also, from the depths of the Recession, stock mkt under Obama up 61% after 10 months. Presidents get too much credit/blame for economies they don't control.
1651 2018-09-08 21:16:30 Quand même bizarre qu'un livre aussi "combattu" soit en ruoture de stocks !
1652 2018-09-08 21:15:12 do you read many of these replies?
its like you are in stocks and the world is throwing rotten tomatoes at you
how are you going to cope?
if you were worth it id feel no one should have that 
no one envies that 
no one would take your place
1653 2018-09-08 21:14:39 One more question which investment  firm did you use? I'm brand new to stocks don't know what the hell I'm doing so I need to hire an advisor
1654 2018-09-08 21:14:26 The college athletes try to win. My football  day is now Saturday.
1655 2018-09-08 21:12:32 Ha! Funny cuz it’s true! 
1656 2018-09-08 21:11:53 $CLDR anyone seeing that gap to fill at 22$
1657 2018-09-08 21:11:50 The Dems are being taken over by socialists and soon will have a National Party. They see nazi everywhere except in the mirror
1658 2018-09-08 21:11:26 He’s right.. if we’re not careful, unemployment might go up to the 5-6% area. Women’s unemployment may surpass the best in 65 year mark and move toward historic numbers. Just because stocks have gone to historic heights, those too can always go higher. Stay frosty people. 
1659 2018-09-08 21:09:41 Sell and buy advanced U3O8 stocks, as this is a once in a life time buying opportunity, the only regret you will have in five years is that you didn't buy more #VO #BOE #ACB #BMN
1660 2018-09-08 21:09:02 it’s just like investing in stocks. 

just pick the ones YOU want and the ones that make YOU happy 

quit giving second chances when YOU KNOW what’s going on 

don’t get hung up with what someone could be…

what/who are they RIGHT NOW is all that’s TRUE
1661 2018-09-08 21:07:00 Wrong again Obama's growth was also 4% when he handed it to you so you inherited good numbers and so far keeping them stable but all the things you are doing will slow that growth- you just can't help but take credit for everything can you- take credit for the falling stocks then
1662 2018-09-08 21:05:39 Stocks, bonds, 401k’s. The unfortunate working class lives paycheck to paycheck and have multiple jobs at low wages. No benefits. Clueless is our @gop.

1665 2018-09-08 20:59:30 Yes it is and yes really decent. I bought 4 albums today. Mainly Jazz but did buy Musique - Keep on jumpin. Andy stocks just about ever genre and you can listen before you buy.
1666 2018-09-08 20:59:23 Nothing puritanical about it. Investors just think that the rest of the world is uptight enough to punish the company for it. Of course, it's only news because the stocks tanked, so they kind of did it to themselves.
1667 2018-09-08 20:59:07 do you read many of these replies?
its like you are in stocks and the world is throwing rotten tomatoes at you

1668 2018-09-08 20:58:49 Very true.. I think once the stock sulks there is no turnaround.. Its merely pump n dump operator story. I have had couple of them in my PF and my endless wait.. I think these manipulated stocks will always be sold as turnarounds.
1669 2018-09-08 20:57:41 uh, no you are not.  Stocks gained more in Obama's first yr than in your 1st. Job gains in 2017 worst since 2010...even Fox reported that.  Potential...as soon as you are gone, we have a chance.

1671 2018-09-08 20:57:24 When I worked at a hedge fund that dealt in H.C. stocks & they shorted pharma cos that were doing trials..I always felt so wrong when we were right 4 that very reason.
Ppl were desperately hoping the drug would work.

It's why I quit & went back 2 school to get into med 2 begin w
1672 2018-09-08 20:54:45 Did you even read the rest of the article? Stocks dropped then increased. My article is more current so that ruins your argument.
1673 2018-09-08 20:53:31 That's good because not everybody has the same gut. Personally, I am not into stocks, it moves too slow. I am learning from a guy who does forex and binary options and he has made over 6 figures doing this. We use a platform to learn all this stuff. I can introduce you to him.

1675 2018-09-08 20:52:11 A committee of nine people (which Hillary a part of, but did not sit) evaluated this sale of Canadian uranium stocks to Russia, Obama approved the sale, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission & others had to offer permits, and none of the uranium was  actually exported to Russia.
1676 2018-09-08 20:50:20 Oh yeah! I remember that stock, although it seems kind of finicky for me, lol
And yeah, full nonsense the whole 16" minimum barrel length for a gun with stocks!
1677 2018-09-08 20:50:13 A few stocks removed from ACJ watchlist: $ANET $BA $BABA $EA $FB $FFTY $GOOGL $GRUB $INXN $IPGP $PYPL $SHOP $AAPL $KEM
1678 2018-09-08 20:48:48 Yup. “It’s safe to buy tech stocks.” Remember 2008?
1679 2018-09-08 20:47:00 Boy you are smart. You can read minds. I’m really impressed. Take your talent and start picking stocks.
1680 2018-09-08 20:46:47 Maybe..they ARE his children after all....
1681 2018-09-08 20:46:12 And most Trump followers have neither 401K nor stocks! Wtf!
1682 2018-09-08 20:45:52 So how many stocks do u own? You must be rich, right?
1683 2018-09-08 20:45:11 Longest stretch of economic and job growth in US history, stocks tripled, huge R deficits lowered by 67%. Largest middle class tax CUT in history. You are embarrassing yourself.
1684 2018-09-08 20:44:54 Trying to find backtested studies on the average return over 2 days on $QQQ stocks when they fall 4 to 5 days straight

1686 2018-09-08 20:41:06 @realDonaldTrump WE ALL KNOW THAT STOCKS SPIKED UPWARD ON NOVEMBER 8, 2016 AFTER DONALD J TRUMP WON ELECTION! JOBS & CONFIDENCE GREW NOV, 2016! THANK YOU POTUS TRUMP!
I don't give Obama any credit for starting good economy!! Dems can't take credit for Nov 2016
HIT IT HOME!
1687 2018-09-08 20:40:38 All those gun control talks while bump fire stocks happened on his clock
1688 2018-09-08 20:39:49 I dont know what to tell you then. I wasn't a big fan of President Obama's but the numbers are the numbers. The economy has had a steady increase since recession. Stocks too have been on a steady rise.
1689 2018-09-08 20:39:33 Hey @iRacing, I know you got a long list of tracks to scan and add, but you should take a look at @bestdirttrack out of Grand Forks, ND. A fast, high banked bull ring. Weekly sprint cars, late models, modifieds, and street stocks.

1693 2018-09-08 20:36:18 NO mistake their stocks are up.
1694 2018-09-08 20:35:54 Congrats AG. A nice confirmation that picking good stocks works in bad times as well as good.
1695 2018-09-08 20:34:52 Shareholders care about stocks tumbling idiot!  Try ECON 101
1696 2018-09-08 20:34:44 Stocks make money. Stocks are businesses that produce value. Not even in the same league.
1697 2018-09-08 20:34:40 Just gained clarity on how to hunt for stocks based on current market conditions. thank you
1698 2018-09-08 20:33:59 Stocks drop 6%
1699 2018-09-08 20:31:33 Is that why you started pumping marijuana stocks now??
1700 2018-09-08 20:31:28 Stocks spiked upward starting Nov 8, 2016 after Trump won election! Obama had nothing to do with economy & jobs starting in November 2016 as Dems try to claim!!
1701 2018-09-08 20:30:33 @elonmusk DON'T WORRY HOMIE I'M SAVING UP FOR SOME TESLA STOCKS! I GOTCHU! And I literally made a Twitter just to tell you that lmao
1702 2018-09-08 20:30:01 Poverty is unnecessary! forex stocks investment
1703 2018-09-08 20:28:46 I only have 1 question for the Tesla bull community.
What other stocks do you like?
1704 2018-09-08 20:28:33 Hello! Stocks for this will be limited, so if you want one, you will need to speak to your preferred retailer to grab one before they're too rare to get easily. ^DB
1705 2018-09-08 20:27:31 Hey @UHC treat this kid like you would your own. Step up and do the right thing. Your quarterly stocks standing will survive. More important is that this child survive - and thrive.
1706 2018-09-08 20:26:58 The real issue is that more of us need to buy Elon musk stock, so Everytime he does something awesome. the stocks go up instead of down. That's how we fix this that's the solution.
1707 2018-09-08 20:25:49 Was it the video and/or the 2 execs that left the company that the stocks fell? They are in California where its legal and he took what one hit?if it was 1930 and he had liquor.Would it be the same reaction? I watched it and its very enlightening. I just hope Skynet doesnt happen
1708 2018-09-08 20:25:43 No need to focus on 5-10 stocks when trading, your mind will get cluttered and your attention will be diverted in too many directions. Don't spread your mind and account out too thin. It can cause burnout quickly
1709 2018-09-08 20:24:41 Recap for Sep 7
$CLDC +12% ($1.02 to $1.14)

1710 2018-09-08 20:24:14 @NFL_Made Thanks for appreciation of my Posts. Let's put race & politics aside & have an awesome football season. My Patriots Play The Texans on Sunday  Sept 9 2018 at 1pm. Just Do It. Like Nike says. Their stocks are up:)
1711 2018-09-08 20:24:11 The economy is only good for the top 20-30%. I'm retired worried about what they'll do to my Social Security and Medicare. I don't have stocks. Yes. I can go try to be a cashier but I'm tired to stand and my hips are achy. So. There's a lot of us our here in la la land.
1712 2018-09-08 20:23:37 Nike’s stocks went up. Jokes on those bitches that burned shit
1713 2018-09-08 20:22:42 This isnt stocks this is the movement of money... you tell me how much inflow invested it would take to reach $10 and I'll take you serious
1714 2018-09-08 20:22:21 Only thing left under BO was to buy stocks. Housing market had tanked, small business owners afraid to expand & economy was so bad they were afraid to borrow; consumers weren’t buying; Americans had little hope-couldn’t afford health insurance. But, hey, stock market was good.
1715 2018-09-08 20:22:08 he keeps bragging about the stock market 
The stocks leading the market the past 2 years are california based
apple computer, google, facebook etc. 
I really can't wait until this is all over
1716 2018-09-08 20:21:43 @Tesla stocks drop after @elonmusk takes 1 hit of weed. Who knew all of their stockholders were prudes?

1719 2018-09-08 20:19:35 Given that sales and stocks are going up, it appears that others are buying more.

If Government had banned him, fine, we’d speak up for the white supremacist troll, truth is he lost coherency.
1723 2018-09-08 20:18:25 WB will only buy Tesla if the stocks keeps sliding down, it’s looking pretty good right now.

1729 2018-09-08 20:13:35 Long ago, someone said sell your other stocks and return to the safe havens of biotech.

That is infinitely more true on Twitter where biotech Twitter is sane, consistent and a very positive community.

1732 2018-09-08 20:10:54 the middle class is worse than the bourgeoisie bc theyre friends with me on fb and i have to see their opinion posts i bet the bezos bitches just post about stocks and vaping cocaine and occasionally how unions are whack
1733 2018-09-08 20:09:49 I think economy is great stocks rising
1734 2018-09-08 20:09:15 Not if he takes away women’s rights and allows bump stocks
1735 2018-09-08 20:08:43 Listen mate, all I've got out of u is that u want to leave the biggest, most successful trade bloc in the world, because you want to trade more with Africa. Also, the EU conserve fishing stocks.  Otherwise, the seas wld be barren from UK over fishing.  Last chance, which laws?
1736 2018-09-08 20:08:31 @pumpygas Dave , have you done any DD on $PACXF or any of the #Pilbara stocks ? A very unique opportunity #Peak Gold When AU turns lookout!
1737 2018-09-08 20:08:20 The tax scam was supposed to increase wages. Instead, CEOs gave themselves raises and bought back stocks, and did not increase workers’ wages. Instead, some got ONE-TIME bonuses, which is just a bandaid
1738 2018-09-08 20:08:00 also make selling and advertising gold and precious metals as investments follow the same rules as other investments like mutual funds and individual stocks, bonds, financial commodities, etc (or at least more strict/ more oversight than currently).
1739 2018-09-08 20:07:59 I don't understand that attitude, because that's some of the most valuable content there is. Of course I'm set up to profit from the volatility in stocks I'm long or short, so maybe my attitude comes from the more neutral short term disposition doing so invokes...
1740 2018-09-08 20:07:47 “tesla stocks take a hit after elon musk does the same” is a quality headline someone deserves a raise
1741 2018-09-08 20:07:41 Then why did stocks fall? I guess this is proof that any publicity is good for business.

What is the ROI , the yeild and dividend so far on the stake government have in JPS? Think the government need to invest in some of these companies in Jamaica by holding their stocks

1751 2018-09-08 19:59:42 Screw you, you have no credibility or relevance.  I will continue to buy Nike products. Stocks are up today, the joke is on you Mr. has been.  You are not the only person allowed to have an opinion.  Go Nike!  Just do it!

1754 2018-09-08 19:59:25 I know you remember how bad the economy was in 2008......you were pumping stocks that lost people life's savings.......
1755 2018-09-08 19:59:19 a record stock market doesn't impact 50% of the us population because they don't have stocks, it impacts the wealthy and the tax cut benefits...the wealthy.

but i'm sure if you spit out enough fox talking points, you'll get something right soon enough...so...?
1756 2018-09-08 19:59:12 Automatic weapons, bump stocks, tariffs, TRUMP…
1757 2018-09-08 19:58:54 Nigga said u prob can’t cuz of the stocks right? 
1758 2018-09-08 19:58:14 For every favourite there are drawbacks that can picked away at. Then there are personal risk appetites- do you prefer penny mining stocks or large producers? If you haven’t done so, follow @quakes99 and look at his past comments. Not buying cameco atm, waiting on tax ruling. 
1759 2018-09-08 19:57:31 It's important to trade the trend and focus on the strongest stocks in a sector. We're currently in another industrial revolution with technology... Focus is key
1760 2018-09-08 19:57:03 So the words out, Nike stocks were falling, that’s why the attention seeking.  Nike is desperate to take this gamble.
1761 2018-09-08 19:55:55 Excellent! In that case I’d take that $1,000 and go $500 each in the two stocks you like most. You could certainly go with all four in the basket but a good rule of thumb is to keep transaction cost to buy the shares at 2% or less for each purchase.
1762 2018-09-08 19:55:09 Stocks?

1765 2018-09-08 19:53:08 Would @Tesla stocks have fallen had @elonmusk taken a sip of beer or alcohol? What if he smoked a cigarette? But he half hit a blunt (which joe rogan clearly plugged the tabacco industry with) and now a decline?? Lmao old people are dumb.
1766 2018-09-08 19:52:02 Look, you have to have a sales tax with seven points of tax. No income tax.
1) Fed
2) state
3 Local
4) stocks
5) government owned
6) gov funded
7) enemy state

Google would be the highest rate.  New entrants could move in with a spread in taxes.  Competition.
1767 2018-09-08 19:52:01 please. stocks come back to previous levels. weed hits are forever. or like 25 mins whatever
1768 2018-09-08 19:50:54 If it's to promote sustainable fishing stocks, absolutely. You have still not answered what laws do you want so desperately to have that the EU is stopping you from having?
1769 2018-09-08 19:50:03 We've made about 100,000, so it's while stocks last!
1770 2018-09-08 19:49:10 I agree and support responsible gun ownership.. just not AR-15’s , bump stocks and war weapons. God bless that lady and her family.
1771 2018-09-08 19:47:36 He did not smoke the blunt, I’m sick of seeing this already.... he tapped the blunt, and didn’t even inhale. People can devalue stocks all they want, he ain’t gettin’ any street cred for this..... #hitsblunt
1772 2018-09-08 19:47:30 Save some money and buy some stocks.
1773 2018-09-08 19:46:19 What if.  What if some bad news came out and uranium stocks cratered? It’s why I sell some on big run ups and hold some.

1775 2018-09-08 19:45:49 Initially their stocks dropped, so get your facts straight. The market fluctuates, let's see where this #KaepernickNikeAd campaign gets them. I'm not burning any shoes but I'm not buying any either. #NikeBoycott
1776 2018-09-08 19:44:00 They were thinking their stocks went up more than 30 percent since this campaign!!

1786 2018-09-08 19:38:33 Oh really? But the stocks dropped dramatically .I guess we’ll see what the American people will decide it’s up to them whether they wanna buy Nike or not.

1802 2018-09-08 19:25:25 First I should state that I’m not a fan Of Jones but I’m a fan of free speech. I have yet to see a word or sentence hearting anyone. Comparing Jones to Hamas is ridiculous. Twitter is bias towards conservatives and it hurts their business ( look at the Twitter’s stocks)
1803 2018-09-08 19:25:11 Following that logic, semi automatic weapons, bump stocks and multi round clips aren’t in the Constitution either so they should be illegal too!
1804 2018-09-08 19:24:00 True, it really is about where, when, how and what we fish. Investing in new fishing technology so that sea stocks are sustainable. When more than half a catch has to be thrown back dead because it's the 'wrong' fish it def is 'Merde'
1805 2018-09-08 19:23:33 and their stocks plummeted.
1806 2018-09-08 19:22:11 I’m not here to prove anything. I already told you that I agree with your general position. Just that the argument of the church opposing prop 2 to save their big pharmaceutical stocks was not a good argument to make.
1807 2018-09-08 19:21:18 Business advice is often total crap, but what I do know is that don't play the penny stocks..
1808 2018-09-08 19:21:15 On attend de savoir s'il y aura des stocks en France directement ou si import (moyen chaud pour éventuellement payer la douane et tout depuis les US, même si ce sera sûrement répercuté sur le prix en euros si y a du stock en France)
1809 2018-09-08 19:20:35 if this could please show up on their stocks, please.. I mean a friend of mine asked for this
1810 2018-09-08 19:19:25 very true there was an a piece on this on The Weeds podcast recently. a white paper on how political confidence drives our spending. Hig stock values because old white guys are the people that buy stocks. good employment because old white guys  are finally getting the new car
1811 2018-09-08 19:18:55 I have it in good authority that Theresa May keeps stocks of Philli...        There is a picture of Corbyn buying Darylea in this weeks Socialist Worker
1812 2018-09-08 19:18:49 It all depends on time frame. 

If we make the comparison to stocks - Amazon just hit 1,000x returns from their 1994 IPO price this week. It took a *25* years of hard work. 

More 1,000x returns will happen, they just won’t be over night.
1813 2018-09-08 19:18:21 I dont think anyone in this entire ecosystem is not sure about anything, lol. BUT.......I like this a heck of alot more than Wall St and stocks with all those crooked CEOs, and rules upon rules.

1815 2018-09-08 19:17:28 If it's not permissioned what is your recourse in a 51% attack? Also why do you need public nodes for tracking stocks? Also what is the advantage to a consumer?
1816 2018-09-08 19:16:56 Recap of 3 hr breakfast w/ @EDWARDTRILEY 

1. Buy growth stocks breaking out of clean tight bases on explosive volume.
2. Pay urself by taking profits
3. Trading for a Living very different than trading as a side biz.
4. Understand ur inner drivers and demons
5. It’s a hard job
1817 2018-09-08 19:15:56 Stock exchanges don’t track the stocks now or provide data— the ledger is run by a centralized trusted 3rd party

Tokens on open public chains eliminate the need for this trusted 3rd party so are a huge improvement over the current system- they also don’t need to be permissioned

1831 2018-09-08 19:08:02 Having good luck with some pot stocks. Might not be a bad plan.
1832 2018-09-08 19:07:53 Btw the money the SEC says team Honig made on the stocks is proceeds not net profit cuz the SEC doesn't know the price they each bought the stock at
1833 2018-09-08 19:06:24 So hit me with the facts. Name the bills, treaties, trade deals, laws, ANYTHING he has created that has helped the economy. Im happy to discuss it.
1834 2018-09-08 19:06:23 Gonna meet with a couple students from the class I taught last spring at Smashburger.

Today im teaching them about important shit: LinkedIn and penny stocks.
1835 2018-09-08 19:04:49 No, I was trying to say that the stocks only regained half OF WHAT THEY LOST, the way I worded it made it seem like I meant 4% is a half, and I apologize, I’m not even trying to make a statement on the matter, just trying to clear things up.
1836 2018-09-08 19:03:30 Cmon man @realDonaldTrump is way better than Obama. He is crushing it. Record low unemployment, booming economy, wages up, jobs up, stocks up. He is stopping taxpayer money from being wasted and donating his salary. Stop the hate.
1837 2018-09-08 19:03:22 isso tem a ver com o fornecedor, os albuns esgotam e segundo um senhor da fnac que me explicou isto, há certos dias em certos meses que vem encher os stocks. por exemplo, há 2 meses que a fnac onde eu vou não tinha o LY her, e agora tem vários mas só a versão O.
1838 2018-09-08 19:03:05 For certain stocks like $ACB $APH they are on a different path so I will consider taking a longer term swing position after the next dip.
1839 2018-09-08 19:02:56 The stocks dropped initially
1840 2018-09-08 19:02:33 Parianas @_machiparu_ Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
1841 2018-09-08 19:01:51 Seasonality is in play. But the recent price action of u308 should support theses stocks and mitigate some of seasonality. Really hope we can see continued u308 price increase next week. Keep up the good work

1847 2018-09-08 18:59:58 Do it for the lorikeets please
1848 2018-09-08 18:58:43 And why is there writhed stocks and cryptos are not considered SOV ?
1849 2018-09-08 18:56:52 On near days Apple capitalization will fall under 1 trillion. Amazon on attendance. Investors must sell these stocks giving a signal to Trump.
1850 2018-09-08 18:56:34 They lost on the stocks, billions - plus many won’t buy again - me included  #justdoit
1851 2018-09-08 18:55:53 it's very, very cool that you value stocks and corporate profit (even of a company you don't even like) over the lives of your fellow person. i'm so glad angry white guys are finally fighting for their own safe spaces.
1852 2018-09-08 18:53:24 You see why stocks dropped ?  Na but fr Elon folded there
1853 2018-09-08 18:52:56 I got allocated some shares in the employee scheme at my work and I feel like a yuppie london stockbroker who reads the FT every day. If I had my way id buy ridiculous stocks
1854 2018-09-08 18:52:52 @Tesco do you know why your Kirkintilloch store no longer stocks the raspberry donut muller light? Had to go to a rival to get it!
1855 2018-09-08 18:52:48 you posting an article from the New York Times just makes me take you less serious than I did before, you are just talking out of your ass now. We started about kap taking a knee and being disrespectful, you started with stocks and have made it all the way to “racism”. Sheep.
1856 2018-09-08 18:52:18 What if... In this message he’s not referring to #MAGA as Make America Great Again... He’s using an acronym to talk about the best hedge fund stocks for the rest of the year. 
#MAGA : MICROSOFT APPLE GOOGLE AMAZON.
1857 2018-09-08 18:52:14 GM, Ford.  The car stocks you should have shorted instead TBH.  Audi, MB, BMW only wrap cars coming from overseas.  Most made in the USA for delivery in USA are shipped uncovered.
1858 2018-09-08 18:51:59 But this is just the bank and in this case a specific branch. BTW - ive myself got so frustrated with @HDFCBank_Cares that I have moved banks. Now waiting for the mf, stocks etc to register the new bank before I happily go and plonk the account closing forms on the managers desk

1860 2018-09-08 18:51:32 US #stock market has greatly outstripped its global rivals, but just one name – #Amazon– accounts for over a third of the overall performance. Add in #Microsoft, #Apple and #Netflix and you have 4 stocks that have generated more than 80% of total gains in the #SP500 this year.
1861 2018-09-08 18:48:11 Are stockholders really that fickle?  Our ecomony rests on the buying and selling of stocks based on the whims of the oligarchy?
1862 2018-09-08 18:47:34 Anyone who owns stocks should have an understanding of how diversity can be beneficial.
1863 2018-09-08 18:47:05 his stocks down 10%, it'll go up 20% ten to the good, he'll make a couple billion, bring co. in black & 100m in pocket, MAGA

1868 2018-09-08 18:45:38 Great charts and analysis of other tops. There is deterioration in the FANGS which have led this bull run. The semiconductor sector looks sickly as well. We have to see if other stocks/sectors pick up the leadership.
1869 2018-09-08 18:45:35 Same. 

Also thinking, "what stocks do I want to short cause this market is about to go bear". Gold pushing up hard is almost always a sure sign of a downturn.

I want to make money coming and going, man.

1881 2018-09-08 18:38:56 Ive seen what hes destroyed, but none he created. Its easy to rescind a reg, not so much to create one. So Im asking what he's CREATED. So far you haven't provided any. You dont seem capable of having a discussion without insulting, Im off. Try not to be so angry... it ages you.
1882 2018-09-08 18:36:54  laughable you think I'm a democrat, that's what I call presumptuous racism. If you wanna talk "business" you could see how good for business this has been for Nike. If you want to talk financials and stocks you would know Nike lost temporarily as did it's shareholders ...

1891 2018-09-08 18:32:10 Still only play 2-3 stocks at the time

1896 2018-09-08 18:30:36 Maybe you also have trouble reading??? I just named several Real world ACTIONS you spoke of... Reread,try again. Rinse &repeat until you comprehend. Anyone who seriously thinks Hussein is responsible for this economy&job market is beyond gullible.
1897 2018-09-08 18:30:34 You don't get the timing; top/bottom of recessions, etc, do you? I don't blame Clinton for the 2000 crash; timing was that GW caught the whole downside - stocks, jobs, deficit. I don't blame GW for the 2008 crash but he caught the downside.  . . con't.
1898 2018-09-08 18:28:32 If ya niggas ever wanted to invest in stocks ya better invest in Nike while the unseasoned people are upset
1899 2018-09-08 18:27:57 That bailout was for our farmers.I think they deserve it Much more than the Hussein bank bailout,or the treasonous Iran deal.

1900 2018-09-08 18:27:19 Well because the African American community buys shoes and not stocks.
1901 2018-09-08 18:27:18 A big thank you from me too Jim it was a very informative week I am learning massive amounts from U & made several trades this week. I learned to take a little profit & use it. that’s huge for me because I usually like to keep stocks doing well. Thanks a million Ha ha ha
1902 2018-09-08 18:27:16 Gwan beat a Metro, until your stocks gwan up.
1903 2018-09-08 18:26:59 Boy I'm buying Nike stocks just so that your dumb ass's raise the value, business 101
1904 2018-09-08 18:26:53 Im more than willing to have a discussion like adults, no names, just facts. Why arent you? Is your argument so weak it cant stand up to criticism?
1905 2018-09-08 18:26:34 Lmao Tesla stocks went down 8% after Elon Musk smoked a joint on the Joe Rogan podcast. Nias act like the bay area isn't already full of potheads
1906 2018-09-08 18:25:22 So in reality, you have nothing. No policies, no trade deals, no laws he created, no treaties? Anything? Im happy to read and listen. Im not sure why you feel you need to be ugly.

1910 2018-09-08 18:22:55 the only lingere shop that stocks my bra size in the whole city is a luxury brand so the bras start at around £100 i need a sugar mama
1911 2018-09-08 18:22:42 That they(and we the people) respect and admire a man who stands up for equality and calls out racial injustices by exercising his constitutional rights. Stocks up...go Nike!  Respect!!
1912 2018-09-08 18:21:15 10% of the richest people in America own 85% of stocks, the only people profiting from all of your lying bullshit is the rich.  But hey! There's a lot more minimum wage jobs out there for all of you, maybe you can afford rent after working at 5 of them a day! Good luck.
1913 2018-09-08 18:21:01 @valuepick 
Sir can you recommend any few stocks which can be bought for 1-3 years time frame .
1914 2018-09-08 18:20:59 Leaders don’t become leaders because they’re loved, it’s because they get shit done. This is true for people and stocks.
1915 2018-09-08 18:20:33 @Tesla stocks have fallen since @elonmusk smoked weed on that podcast. Fuck that he still rich. I support it.
1916 2018-09-08 18:20:31 Online sales..  Just a rush if dems on their keyboards. Watch the next 6 months or year. Nike stocks will drop
1917 2018-09-08 18:20:10 That's the essence of my question. Would I really be increasing my risk level to go further overweight in #uranium stocks? I used to think that was true... but given U risk/reward now & high risk to oil/gas/gold/silver plays in market correction, changing my mind to "not sure".
1918 2018-09-08 18:20:06 Thanks for following along! I tend to like the first stock purchase being shares of an S&P 500 index fund if you don’t have any exposure to stocks at all. With $1,000 you could go half/half index fund & a stock. Are you currently participating in an IRA/company sponsored 401(k)?
1919 2018-09-08 18:19:43 A bond delivering at actual interest 6% over 3 years is a good SOV. Stocks delivering 8% over 3 years is a bad performance
1920 2018-09-08 18:19:37 Nike is trying to say their online sales actually went up! How does that work! Stocks down a billion sales up? 
1921 2018-09-08 18:18:37 Again- I didn’t bet because and told you it wouldn’t make sense. Stocks would always beat bonds over longer period of time! You don’t measure quality of an SOV by its performance.
1922 2018-09-08 18:16:53 Why did their stocks drop, then?
1923 2018-09-08 18:16:09 Wonder if a decent model for individuals buying stocks (esp 30yo men) is they are buying a call option on bragging rights
1924 2018-09-08 18:15:25 OK so lets say a non binding agreement was a scam... What has trump DONE or CREATED that has helped the economy... there must be SOMETHING, right? Its been 20 months now. He must have created SOME policy or law that went through congress, right? What about completed trade deals?
1925 2018-09-08 18:14:24 Stocks didn’t tank..they went down slightly the first day, as did the entire market . Since then everything’s been up and it continues to rise 
1926 2018-09-08 18:13:57 Trend-following, long-dated puts, and VIX futures at the back end of the term structure have historically worked pretty well. Treasury bonds and low-volatility stocks have also worked at times, but yields on the former and valuations in the latter are less favorable today.
1927 2018-09-08 18:13:52 Mind saying a few favs of the US and Canadian stocks in U sector? I’ve watched URA for a year now but don’t follow others.

1931 2018-09-08 18:12:28 But one major thing I tell a lot of people is find stocks that work with you as a person. Don’t just stick with what’s worked for you - coulda been luck. Coulda just been a major bull market. Develop a style that matches ur personality. It makes pos mgmt much easier.
1932 2018-09-08 18:11:58 Just need a little bit more euphoria in weed stocks, slightly more pain in crypto and people will finally give up on it. Then time to dollar cost in again.
1933 2018-09-08 18:11:46 My question to #uranium community: Fire sale buying opportunity continues for #U3O8 #stocks. Already WAY overweight in U names. Still own oil/gas/gold/silver stocks. Should I sell those & buy more U stocks? Would that add or reduce portfolio risk to broad market correction?
1934 2018-09-08 18:11:45 We are slowly moving out from IT stocks and getting into Metal Index.. 

Let's see how it goes
1935 2018-09-08 18:11:15 Adolfo pareces serio, apoyar este tipo de inversiones no te ayuda, te puede estallar .
1936 2018-09-08 18:11:02 I'd say we're on par with the US at the moment. Both of us have become laughing stocks because of our utterly ridiculous and incompetent governments.
1937 2018-09-08 18:10:33 I assume u mean The Paris accord..which was a complete scam on the American Tax payers.Too bad you're too brainwashed to see it.And we (ALL AMERICAN'S) just keep winning.Really strange some really dumb ppl are actually hoping we start losing,& hope for a recession.Nice spelling
1938 2018-09-08 18:07:35 Subtract out the trillions printed for QE.  Which when straight to boost stocks, earnings did not warrent it. More small business failed than succeded because of regulations that killed them.

1940 2018-09-08 18:05:52 Having money invested in stocks has caused me to save the most money I’ve ever had saved. 10/10 would recommend
1941 2018-09-08 18:05:11 Who cares if the stock market is up?  I don' have any stock, but the top 1% own 90% of stocks.  And now no taxes!  How nice for them, but the rest of us? No more clean water,, not more clean air, and because of @realDonaldTrump no more net neutrality.  What an idiot!
1942 2018-09-08 18:04:18 stocks are volatile my dude. nike has dropped more than 5% in one day previously and it will happen again. The main thing is that they will rebound and keep climbing. The 4 billion "lost" today is nothing in the long run.
1943 2018-09-08 18:03:32 Hey now take out the billions printed for QE, all ended up to boost stocks. Which by way helped his rich buddies.
1944 2018-09-08 18:02:29 History will repeat itself. A lot of the continued rise of the markets is based on false value through buybacks of stocks. Unless the economy is pushed mainly by middle & lower classes, it always comes down with a boom.
Just need to look at the numbers since the great depression.
1945 2018-09-08 18:01:55 Ok super England Stokes super bowling tomorrow best bowling stocks ok super
1946 2018-09-08 18:01:48 He sure sounds like a President which fooled millions but what exactly did he achieve? In 18 months Trump decimated ISIS,talked with N.Korea,the economy & stocks soared,jobs too,record black employment,the number of  child trafficking/pedo operations etc is astonishing too..
1947 2018-09-08 18:01:03 did i just buy some mfin stocks?? heck yea i did. do i know what im doing?? nope

1950 2018-09-08 18:00:00 After #BTC's August losses, September seems to be starting badly with most cryptos registering double-digit losses. 

The recent downward trend had an effect on the number of opened positions on eToro, as August favored tech stocks. 

Will this trend on cryptos turn?

1955 2018-09-08 17:55:44 I have never understood stocks or owning property. Its definitely cool to see how someone can achieve so much.
1956 2018-09-08 17:54:43 We don’t give homie stocks out here
1957 2018-09-08 17:52:49 Yes...stocks which are quite ill liquid at lower levels become highly liquid at higher levels
1958 2018-09-08 17:52:49 You are Absolutely Correct. Sorry about your Son. Colin is just a Punk n Disrespectful guy. Wants to create Publicity for his name. He's to blame for the NFL losing Fans going to the Games. Nike Stocks went down 2.7%. It just a name, there are better Shoes than Nike. All BS
1959 2018-09-08 17:52:31 Go for penny stocks
1960 2018-09-08 17:52:15 La corrección en algunas de las stocks que componen este indice debería estar por terminar, mientras que en otras esta comenzando , posiblemente una consolidación sea el resultado en el indice ó una bajada mas suave hasta hacer el piso...

1963 2018-09-08 17:51:08 So after a quite an intensive meat feast for many meals this week the stocks have now been depleted enough for me to stock up on more vegetarian/vegan ingredients for this weeks meals...
1964 2018-09-08 17:50:26 Nope, but you’re not far from Star Speedway in Epping. Pro stocks and late model races tonight. Also 350 super modifieds. Quarter mile asphalt track. Awesome racing.
1965 2018-09-08 17:50:06 No, you’re not. 
A one day dip is nothing in stock market. You have to look long term. Which is why i made my original comment. 

People who make real money in stocks don’t talk about it on twitter.
1966 2018-09-08 17:47:20 Home building company stocks are taking it on the chin-numerous housing data points point to a slowdown. per ABC. Most of the builders are down more than 15 percent this year, even as the broader market has been on a milestone-setting run. The S&P 500 is up about 8% for the year.
1967 2018-09-08 17:47:04 Stocks for political figures could be the new reality entertainment
1968 2018-09-08 17:46:21 True, but initially the Wall Street Journal said Nike Stocks dropped as a result of the announcement, so to me, they took a brave risk :)
1969 2018-09-08 17:46:13 Tesla stocks drop cause of a blunt... haha better go buy
1970 2018-09-08 17:45:18 They are all hurt if measured today, due to EM contagion and bear market in CN stocks. Not from spinoffs. Get your proximate cause right.
1971 2018-09-08 17:44:49 This is true, but if she’s someone who actively traded stocks she should know about how Americans save for retirement.
1972 2018-09-08 17:44:20 Stocks close lower on first trading day of September, Nike tops Dow losers   lol
1973 2018-09-08 17:44:09 Dividend paying stocks only because the promoters are forced to manage the business efficiently

Think about it - a dividend paying company's CEO wakes up and thinks "My cash flows better be in order, I have to pay Mr. Strongman his dividend" - better governance

Plus, I get paid
1974 2018-09-08 17:42:24 Stocks, however, plunged.
1975 2018-09-08 17:42:23 Trump is flying the idea of inflating the purchase price of stocks(by inflation) that are sold at profit, to reduce the capital tax obligation at sale. This will further reduce tax revenues, and increase un-earned incomes for the very rich folks.
1976 2018-09-08 17:42:17 You’ve never owned stocks have you. Everyone with a job and a 401K owns at least some stocks.
1977 2018-09-08 17:41:59 finished listening to Joe Rogans podcast with Elon Musk. This guy is pure genius i wouldnt pull my stocks from his companies in fact i would put more in 
1978 2018-09-08 17:41:20 That makes you mad brah? There are overinflated stocks out there, go buy those.
1979 2018-09-08 17:40:47 #Nike will be ok. Stocks doing just fine. Thanks to millennials (and global philanthropy), Nike will survive. Haven't bought Nike's in year just came back from buying the whole family a pair. 
1980 2018-09-08 17:40:40 Hope you’re in line already and hope there’s still stocks for you, bby
1981 2018-09-08 17:40:27 What was the name of the exchange to buy stocks from btc ?
1982 2018-09-08 17:40:20 Tesla stocks were already going down before he hit that blunt, let’s move on people.
1983 2018-09-08 17:40:13 Saturday’s are for the sisters, and the couch, and motzorella stocks.
1984 2018-09-08 17:39:37 Here's what a good diversified portfolio looks like:

Not more than 5% in one company.
Not more than 20% in one industry.
All stocks in the portfolio should dividend paying (helps reduce risk and you avoid fraudulent promoters)
5% in gold (insurance)
5-10% in risky bets
1985 2018-09-08 17:39:23 $WWE Now ranked #1 in the IBD 50. 
Last qtr EPS 100%
Sales 31%
5 qtrs of EPS > 15%
ROE 12%
Relative Strength 99. 

Well that's comforting. #stocks #investing #money

1988 2018-09-08 17:39:02 The Temple shop stocks more than 2,000 specialty items and frequently adds to its inventory, making it a wonderful place to purchase multiple goods for use in your own ritual workings.
1989 2018-09-08 17:38:15 In other business news Casa Verde Capital, the $45m venture firm making Series A investments in the cannabis industry, is facing plummeting stocks after one of its cofounders Calvin Cordozar Broadus Jr., also known as ‘Snoop Dog’, was seen on video smoking a marijuana cigarette.
1990 2018-09-08 17:37:33 an age old banking practice, the bank chairman can invest all the money in the bank over the weekend into quick stocks, as long as the moneys back by Monday morning, and all the investing accrued will be  in his personal account
1991 2018-09-08 17:37:15 Tariffs or American wages, even with out taxes, tbe cost is going up and the stocks will be going down. Your solution wouldn't work Don.

1993 2018-09-08 17:35:55 Elon Musk talks openly about his life and the potential future of the human race for 2 1/2 hours and the news turns it into “HE INJECTED MAREEWUANNEES AND STOCKS DROPPED 7%!”

Maybe it really is time to stop reading/watching news altogether. #fuckthenews
1994 2018-09-08 17:35:42 WRONG, NIKE'S  STOCKS HAVE GONE UP AND UP.

okayyyyyy
1997 2018-09-08 17:34:50 Everyone should go and buy @Tesla stocks i sure em. @elonmusk and everyone is free in this country so STFU
1998 2018-09-08 17:34:24 I called my local Kinokuniya to check if they had received stock early, then they called me back to say that stocks were in so I went down immediately to get a copy!
1999 2018-09-08 17:33:42 As long as she’s slow, idc. At that point they earned it lol Gus isn’t generally the one that two stocks me anyway. That’s mute. Gus and I handle each other hard. Mute’s just better than me

2005 2018-09-08 17:28:40 Well saying its worth a look and saying that its good time to buy are completely different things. No point in boasting now. If you had conviction then why didnt you stick your neck out and clearly state that these stocks are worth buying. Hindsight is always 20 20
2006 2018-09-08 17:28:36 @Amit_Jeswani1 sir please suggest some good basic books for gaining good knowledge about stocks and markets (not trading related books).
2007 2018-09-08 17:27:34 I hear stocks have gone down for Tesla following this interview... I really am a weirdo cos I barely know what tesla is but I certainly would be more into it AFTER this interview
2008 2018-09-08 17:26:23 @WeekendInvestng sir please suggest some good basic books for gaining good knowledge about stocks and markets (not trading related books)
2009 2018-09-08 17:26:21 Promouvoir le livre pour faire saliver le futur lecteur + limiter les stocks pour que la peur de la rupture gagne le client et qu’il se rue chez le libraire = stratégie reprise des entreprises « inhumaines » ? 
2010 2018-09-08 17:26:10 Money in 401k accounts that they won't let us hold our own money privately. If @Bakkt makes it so people can invest the money already locked up in 401ks into Bitcoin instead of stocks then they will start doing so.
2011 2018-09-08 17:24:13 I gotta say John- had you told me 1 year ago that Spot would be at this price with fundamentals seemingly improving by the week but U stocks such as FCU, DML, NXE, UXE and so many others would be trading where they are I would have said your crazy!!
2012 2018-09-08 17:23:45 Vous expliquerez ça à votre banquier quand vous ferez un emprunt ! Blague à part, les analyses les + intéressantes comparent svnt stocks et flux. Ça permet de donner une dynamique à un stock par nature de lecture statique. Une bonne part de l’analyse fin est bâtie là-dessus.
2013 2018-09-08 17:23:44 true politicians stocks in prisons would go to waste
2014 2018-09-08 17:23:34 Or "my hedge-fund returns will be boosted by the opportunities to short stocks in the chaos"
2015 2018-09-08 17:23:33 i'm glad nikes stocks are up tho
2016 2018-09-08 17:22:41 The value of 2A is the ability to protect self &others. When the presence of weapons does the exact opposite, that's a failure & a corruption of the Constitution.Anyone fighting 4general availability of high powered weapons&bump stocks promotes destruction,terror &murder, not 2A.
2017 2018-09-08 17:21:53 I know what you mean....but the stocks are also a foray into block chain development projects which the Crypto currencies don't provide. Besides the stocks have PTO this point been less volatile than the currencies. Still waiting to see how tomorrow plays out.

2019 2018-09-08 17:21:32 Unfortunately, most of that is N/A here (and I suspect, other locales). We get weather and stocks, and little else. None of that demonstrated in the video/gif? are available otherwise. Region-locking sucks
2020 2018-09-08 17:21:25 You will never disarm America but u will bankrupt your business. U don’t believe it watch ur stocks once this gets out!
2021 2018-09-08 17:21:17 Don't listen to Bloomberg for stocks & economy, totally fraud, make no sense, so UK and USA work harder than China but China has better economic growth than UK and USA for decades, either Chinese is smarter than British and Americans or socialism is better than capitalism? Moron!
2022 2018-09-08 17:21:13 If China slows imports, raising our in-country stocks, shouldn’t apple prices drop?
2023 2018-09-08 17:19:09 It's possible but it seems far more like a narcissistic meltdown which doesn't preclude that but the man seems too obsessed with his public perception to willingly tank it to short his own stocks.
2024 2018-09-08 17:18:39 Moron. Man who took a fortune and made less with it than he would if he simply bought top 50 stocks is going to try and tell real companies how to run their business
2025 2018-09-08 17:18:24 I traded all my stocks for investment grade diamonds.
2026 2018-09-08 17:17:38 When it all comes to a head the industry suits will not produce decent weed. Too profit minded. 
How many stocks are overinflated and yet to produce any product?
Grow your own and let the industry do what it is going to do anyway.
2027 2018-09-08 17:16:49 Met too many idiots along the way who want *me* to make my money work harder ( invest in stocks ) and be more leveraged( home loan, car loan) . Read too much @nntaleb to fall into those traps.
2028 2018-09-08 17:16:04 UK Gov - we want brexit!!  Others are not doing their bit. Unis need to do more and stop sulking, small businesses need to get used to more red tape, pharma companies will need to build up drug stocks, etc. We, on the other hand will hand over all responsibility to others -simple
2029 2018-09-08 17:15:12 I've found that patience, like with all trades, is the most important factor for future. The difference from trading stocks or options though is that the punishment for not having it is much higher. The reward is equally high though, so there's some opportunity there.
2030 2018-09-08 17:14:39 We're still riding the Obama wave, followed by a stock market bubble resulting from more than 80% of companies using their tax cut windfalls to buy back stocks rather than growing their businesses. It ain't over yet.
2031 2018-09-08 17:14:27 Oh, seems we get a black Monday for apple stock and all other tech stocks ??
2032 2018-09-08 17:13:30  But that's exactly what Amazon is doing! Paying fair wage (above minimum state wages). Great benefits (Medical, bonus, stocks, matched 401k, and 95% college tuition). So what exactly are we asking for? #Iaintmad #whatcanisay #proudamazonian #lovemyjob
2033 2018-09-08 17:12:31 Because everyone has power & power behaves like a stock (future value uncertain w expected positive drift)...& we know from free market studies that the best risk/reward on a collection of stocks is a diverse portfolio representative of the population of stocks & beat hedge funds
2034 2018-09-08 17:12:20 *steals stocks*
2035 2018-09-08 17:11:52 hey folks it's your pal l_ron. cryptos aren't stocks, they dont require revenue or users really. a crypto can maintain value in perpetuity based on the whims of one or even zero people. an AI  for instance could create a crypto which retains value indefinitely.
2036 2018-09-08 17:10:35 The kind of portfolio construction and stock selection done by mutual funds is the reason. Stocks are not cheap even now. Quality issues are still there. I fear a potential valuation contraction. This can happen when investors are not well prepared.
2037 2018-09-08 17:10:15 Abyss? 157 percent GDP growth under Obama. Rescued US from greatest stock market crash (due to Bush policies) since the depression. During the same period stocks grew 33percent. 26 prcnt for Trump. Trump is riding Obama's wave.
2038 2018-09-08 17:09:59 I don't pump the few stocks that I do like - and mostly I never Tweet about them. When you invest a lot of time, and even cash, in proper DD, you benefit by not sharing it.
2039 2018-09-08 17:09:29 So many of we working class employees and retired folk never see the benefits of rising stock (other than our status quo being maintained). I don’t hate the rich, but I’m far more interested in morality, peace, and the kinds of happiness that rising stocks do not bring.
2040 2018-09-08 17:08:26 @skmajee i have icici securities stocks from IPO cost,  which is already 33% loss for me...I'm a long term value investor.. shall i hold or sell?
2041 2018-09-08 17:08:19 Unfortunately our economy is slowing. Last 2 months jobs reports were revised down 50k. Ford and Gm and homebuilder stocks are in a bear market. Inflation is on the rise. Labor participation rate is way too high, deficits are growing, trade deficits are the largest ever.....
2042 2018-09-08 17:08:01 People are honestly delusional about stocks. A 3-5% drop isn't even that much and happens regularly.
2043 2018-09-08 17:07:39 Do you believe that the gold majors are at 2001 lows & ETFs are at 1997 or 1981 lows because this is just a bear market that's doing what it has to do ? Yet these gold stocks peaked in 2007 along with all other stocks. Now all other stocks are in the biggest rally ever.
2044 2018-09-08 17:06:57 In prefer to just own straight up crypto. The stocks are too risky, plus I want less exposure through stocks and diversification.
2045 2018-09-08 17:06:33 I low-key wonder if @JAYBUMAOM stocks his fans on twitter 
2046 2018-09-08 17:05:36 But a lot of my money went to stocks so it’s not all bad lol
2047 2018-09-08 17:04:56 The left sees nazi everywhere except in the mirror. As socialists take over the Dems to begin the National Socialists Party
2048 2018-09-08 17:04:46 Yet, their stocks are up.
2049 2018-09-08 17:04:35 I'm also looking at crytpo mining stocks and $riot got hammered on Friday with a SEC inquiry into fraudulent dealings. Down nearly 25%
2050 2018-09-08 17:04:05 Thanks for telling me about stocks
2051 2018-09-08 17:03:25 i agree but the banks have won this round as well, historic tax cuts , deregulation and soaring stocks means that Wall Street comes out on top again.
2052 2018-09-08 17:03:04 @CNNPolitics  hold my beer
2053 2018-09-08 17:02:20 Nah, the stocks getting smocked because Tesla’s CAO left after 21 workdays despite an unvested 10MM USD compensation package. And he’s the second CAO leaving the company within 6 months. That’s a major red flag. Watch the bonds.
2054 2018-09-08 17:02:06 Sir what's the criteria for screening the stocks
2055 2018-09-08 17:01:51 Delusional- you support sharia law
2056 2018-09-08 17:01:36 No water shortage, no bans. we had several storms over the winter brought records levels of water. Water Stocks over full. Re gardens we use sprinklers at night, around 2am for 30mins at source. Never seen Spain so green this year. Lowest level of wildfires in 20 yrs. Agua 
2057 2018-09-08 17:01:33 Of course that percentage can be much with larger sums of money, but it is matter of starting with something. Instead of individual personally picked stocks, funds distribute the risk of individual investors to a wider amount of different stocks & markets without much of extra.
2058 2018-09-08 16:59:46 Also don't forget: fundamentals for stocks are sound, as in less taxes and good profits for companies; unlike his predecessors, Trump is a businessman and fully understands economics in a practical sense, which is what counts.
2059 2018-09-08 16:59:43 Merci de donner du stock à Amazon, c'est la cata pour le moment les stocks d'Amazon....

2061 2018-09-08 16:59:30 What’s your Point? Many stocks dropped, died, rallied!
2062 2018-09-08 16:58:59 Main issue is that transaction costs eat profitability of the small purchases when the volume & size of purchase is smaller. Funds might be cheaper compared to traditional stocks, since initial trading cost is small (while the total cost might be between ~0.6-2.0%).
2063 2018-09-08 16:57:51 The economy is slowing. Last 2 months jobs were revised down 50k. Gm, Ford and home builder stocks are in a bear market. Job participation numbers are way down. Last 2 months of manufacturing numbers were revised massively down. Not your fault just the cycle.
2064 2018-09-08 16:57:02 We should bring back the stocks, seemed to work back then...
2065 2018-09-08 16:56:10 Also wrong. The stocks have regained half of the 4% they dropped. Not half their worth lmaooo
2066 2018-09-08 16:55:12 I’m about to buy some stocks too!!! Don’t know much about to game but I’m going to invest into it, into myself and into my future
2067 2018-09-08 16:55:07 Finland has banks that don't require big opening balance before allowing buying of traditonal stocks and funds. Cost of individual stock purchase depends on the volume, but can be around 5-7 € per trade if one has several purchases per month.
2068 2018-09-08 16:55:04 Don’t own stocks for the next 5 years
2069 2018-09-08 16:54:11 Already emailed RH support about the beneficiary details, as who will receive any crypto or stocks etc if I die? RH isn't like a real brokerage account that actually requires that info!  They didn't answer me or my partner in regards to this matter! IMO Robinhood is shady MF's!
2070 2018-09-08 16:54:04 Also lol at posting a year long graph like that has anything to do with this week in which their stocks are still down since the announcement.
2071 2018-09-08 16:52:42 Stocks and Stines might break my bones, but dyslexia is my real problem.
2072 2018-09-08 16:50:34 For only a few hours then it went back up again.  Nike stocks up 30% this year so you're reading FAKE NEWS.
2073 2018-09-08 16:50:29 you wanna know how i lost these stocks
2074 2018-09-08 16:49:21 Ah comme moi ce matin j'ai passé au moins 30 min a faire les stocks secs
2075 2018-09-08 16:47:38 Frank Kimmel Street Stocks. Literally iracing street stocks at charlotte in real life
2076 2018-09-08 16:47:33 Why I buy #cryptocurrency each month (a fixed amount of fiat):

- Averaging out the price;
- I'm in it for the long term (the really long term I mean);
- I take #cryptocurrency as serious as my funds and stocks and I invest a fixed amount of fiat in those assets as well.
2077 2018-09-08 16:46:57 Ha!
2078 2018-09-08 16:46:33 I just bought some stocks.... I feel pretty grown 
2079 2018-09-08 16:46:27 Seriously? Him smoking a little weed is that big of a deal? But stocks don’t fall for banks when their CEOs get caught doing coc and screwing hookers? We live in a sad world.
2080 2018-09-08 16:45:57 This Man Elon Musk’s stocks dropped because he hit a blunt. If anyone need that Shit its him. I swear people got nothing better to hate on 
2081 2018-09-08 16:44:58 Hey @TuckerCarlson the right analogy for diversity is strength is to stock portfolios. You know all about that on the right. Stocks or ecological, evolutionary, species population and genetics, diversification is strength, no?
2082 2018-09-08 16:44:44 The Democrats are being taken over by socialists and soon they will have their own National Party.
The National Socialists Party.
2083 2018-09-08 16:43:43 @carthyandblack Can you please tell me where I can find your Lemon Gin Cream Liqueur? Tesco is doing a special offer but apparently no Tesco in Plymouth stocks it!! What other stores may stock it? Thanks.
2084 2018-09-08 16:43:29 You’re aware this is open to close & their stocks are currently at a five year high, correct????
2085 2018-09-08 16:43:21 It really is an entertaining turn of events, and the equity to #U3O8 ratios are so amusing, I bought into U stocks (throughout 2016-2017) at around $19-$20 and at (soon)$27 I'm at -12% U PF wide.
2086 2018-09-08 16:43:19 Still creasing that Elon Musk smoked a joint on a live podcast and had Tesla stocks fall when he didn’t even inhale properly lmao give the guy a break
2087 2018-09-08 16:43:04 Over 50% of Americans have to choose between paying for housing or food every month. Wages are still stagnant, 38% are working two jobs to survive. Unless you own stocks, the massive tax cut to corporations is not trickling down .
2088 2018-09-08 16:42:35 Paid delusion
2089 2018-09-08 16:42:34 Once again thanks to all those that follow me especially the 50+ new followers I’ve gained today, if only my stocks at the minute would show as big a one day gain 

Thanks to @rhomboid1MF for his promotional skills 
2090 2018-09-08 16:41:22 You are correct my friend. All she has to do is try sesrching it. If she has a smart phone go to stocks Nike is probably there by default. Oh watch out now the pattern is connecting. lol
2091 2018-09-08 16:40:00 Sales up, but stocks down! Nike
2092 2018-09-08 16:39:58 The crisis is about to hit and when it does soon,your assets,houses,stocks,shares,bonds,apartments,land,cars,boats,paintings, all of it will drop in value,down below 50% of their current value,all except Gold and Silver and Bitcoin
2093 2018-09-08 16:38:51 Hey Stocks-n-Crypto(@StocksNCrypto), thank you for following me
2094 2018-09-08 16:38:50 And let’s be realistic unsophisticated retail buys classic momentum & affinity stocks and in the wrong cycle these will massive underperform benchmarks. Better to pay off debt and with excess cash buy short duration bank CDs.
2095 2018-09-08 16:38:43 What is the % of stock ownership in the country? Over 50% of the population does not own stocks. The buybacks mainly benefit the top 1%. And, I DO know how buybacks work.
2096 2018-09-08 16:38:40 @Tesla Why service center is so bad....?
Bring model 3 for a flat tire and after 3 days..., no tire in stocks...
Service center there is no parking available and have to wait in queue...
Plus couldn’t find key card...
Frustrating is the word....
2097 2018-09-08 16:37:56 Plus I think it's being over blown, a lot of stocks are going down right now... I thought the interview was dope

2099 2018-09-08 16:37:21 @elonmusk Elon, super fan..., but why service center is so bad....
Bring model 3 for a flat tire and after 3 days..., no tire in stocks...
Service center there is no parking available and have to wait in queue...
Plus couldn’t find key card...
Frustrating is the word....
2100 2018-09-08 16:36:53 Wrong, stocks regained about half their worth and are still struggling to maintain that figure, if you’re going to make a statement, you should look at the actual page you’re citing and posting a picture of first
2101 2018-09-08 16:36:40 Trolls
2102 2018-09-08 16:36:40 Question -- Does a broad US index like SP500 offer diversification?  It would appear, it's hard to beat 500 large stocks, representing many sectors.
2103 2018-09-08 16:33:57 Thanks to your tips that's the plan, wouldn't trade in penny stocks till I understand 100% as to how to trade them properly... Not a big fan of loosing money 
2104 2018-09-08 16:33:55 I do that all the time.
Sell puts in stocks I want 2 buy.
2105 2018-09-08 16:33:50 @Tesla stocks hit a 52 week low w/ @elonmusk shown smoking weed on @joerogan show.   thats what you folks are concern with.
2106 2018-09-08 16:33:49 What loss? Stocks?’
2107 2018-09-08 16:32:42 this fall:

accumulating growth stocks > accumulating shitcoins

prove me wrong
2108 2018-09-08 16:31:59 One Irish wag suggested the Senate  now only exists  to make the Dail look good. The last speech of any note was Yeats'  'No petty people' speech in the early 1920s. .
' We against whom you have done this thing, are no petty people. We are one of the great stocks of Europe. . .'
2109 2018-09-08 16:30:07 C’est le club où les mecs les plus stocks sont réunis !
2110 2018-09-08 16:29:22 Nah just an opportunity to fix the artificial up stocks have been having
2111 2018-09-08 16:29:17 Nike stocks have plummeted and continue to decline since the campaign of colin the coward began Nike is a multi billion dollar company whose monetary worth is determined by stock value one day of good sales is not even a drop in the bucket Nike is suffering for their foolishness
2112 2018-09-08 16:28:50 “I have nothing but respect for @maggieNYT.” Perhaps consider expanding the repertoire of your regard. “Rhetorically evasive” is one of her stocks in trade.
2113 2018-09-08 16:28:49 That was the "high" light of the interview, but the stocks dropped. Ouch.
2114 2018-09-08 16:28:15 There are only 3 asset classes: stocks, bonds and cash equivalents.
2115 2018-09-08 16:27:30 Comparing Kap to these amazing athletes is just wrong.  He was a medicore athlete who protested on company time.  He should of just stayed on his knee the entire game because he was riding the bench anyway.  Horrible move Nike! Stocks are falling.
2116 2018-09-08 16:27:06 Is not helping my family’s bottom line one bit and am missing my pre-tax bill mortgage tax deduction. I am not one who benefits from breaks on carried interest (like hedge funders, VCs) or benefits to those with pass through businesses (like yourself). If stocks fall, then what?
2117 2018-09-08 16:26:46 According to your dialogue, new plants are opening all over the country.  So why are US manufacturing companies losing billions in their stock value?  IBM, GM. Ford and US Steel stocks all down huuugely this year.
2118 2018-09-08 16:25:51 Too funny how Obama thinks he did well.  He came in durring a very low point, economy and stocks were going to go up even if Jimmy Carter were elected.  The #RealDeal is how @realDonaldTrump took an overpriced market up even more, corp tax cuts raised corp value.
2119 2018-09-08 16:25:44 Interesting he is there. I saw Kevin on BNN years back telling investors to avoid these stocks because of the risks associated with them. Wonder who is in his portfolio. But nice to see a full 180 from him.

2123 2018-09-08 16:24:26 Sorry *smartish* Menelaus. I have invested in S&P500 stocks and the rest in a managed account. Quite ironically some you shorts on Tesla maybe managing some the funds I hold. Perhaps I am on Twitter to question your conscience as you make money for me.
2124 2018-09-08 16:22:56 Will miss seeing you this season.

2129 2018-09-08 16:21:11 I for one opted out, I store value in crypto, and a globally diversified portfolio of stocks, FIAT currency is not solid and should be used only for your monthly expenses at the supermarket nothing else. Crypto $ is the future and this volatility we see now will subside with time
2130 2018-09-08 16:20:58 @OpTic_BigTymeR Yo big T, I’m sure you’ve heard about the Tesla stocks dropping dramatically from him “smoking pot” on the joe rogan podcast. What’s your thoughts on the future, good investment ?
That boy got some crazy ideas fam...
2131 2018-09-08 16:20:57 Kinda feel like Elon Musk is purposely doing crazy shit to drive the price of his stocks down so that other's can invest in his company at a low before the build back up (He's probably got something revolutionary in the wings).

Elon musk going off the rails is corporate deceit.
2132 2018-09-08 16:19:53 a recession would cause panic once again and force people to find a new means, there will be a stock crash soon, nothing goes up forever. Sure  has you can say ppl tp stocks and invest in crypto, but that yet to happen as we can see. There is also the flip side, stocks dump btfd
2133 2018-09-08 16:19:49 Quand j’suis partie chez l’opticien y’avait plus ma paire de lunette j’étais  on m’a proposé d’autres rayban j’ai fais « bon ok j’aime bien... » puis dans les stocks y’avait celles que je voulais puis j’ai sorti « vous me réchauffez le coeur madame » la dame a paniqué j’crois
2134 2018-09-08 16:19:48 I am big fan of yours.. If we implement your ideas on right time, right stocks then "only profit will come in our pocket". Thank you to both of you..

Higher unemployment when eco stagnates.

The fed’s on a tightrope w/ extremely low unemployment. A fade in stocks will have major effects on ppl not just prices.
2137 2018-09-08 16:15:01 It looks a bit grey
2138 2018-09-08 16:14:55 The bots are out in full force! As our @POTUS keeps on Trucken working 24/7 to #MAGA More Jobs, Lowest unemployment ever, lower Taxes, lower utility bills, skyrocketing stocks, illegals deported, Regs Cut, stronger military, fewer on welfare, ALL Americans prospering! #Walkaway
2139 2018-09-08 16:14:37 I haven’t had this problem arise yet bc I’ve only been investing modest amounts of $ into stocks until fairy recently. But it is an issue, and I’m not sure what to think about it.
2140 2018-09-08 16:14:36 Sorry if you answered this elsewhere, but here’s my genuine question: 
1. If I lose my private keys have I lost my company shares?
2. If so, why would tokenised stocks be more desirable than a centralised, backed up, KYC friendly clearing house with an SQL database?
2141 2018-09-08 16:14:24 My trips to work consist of me looking up stocks to buy and sports games to bet on 
2142 2018-09-08 16:14:24 and considering there are rubbish stocks over billion cap in nasdaq..
2143 2018-09-08 16:13:43 Yung tito ko galit na galit sa inflation rate potang ina lugi na raw stocks nya hahahahahahaha ako’y pinapasaya lalasingin ko pa ito hhahahahahaha
2144 2018-09-08 16:12:57 Needed a formula to do calculations between two numbers, the difference between two columns divided by the first column will give me a percentage than the sum percentage of that whole column. Doing paper stocks, so I’m tracking the weekly percentage change.
2145 2018-09-08 16:10:26 Those 160 members are able to discuss stocks with each other?
2146 2018-09-08 16:09:58 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
2147 2018-09-08 16:08:58 I did watch some of it. Did you see his stocks dropped after the show aired?
2148 2018-09-08 16:07:28 They can’t be allowed to wreck the country for their personal fuckwittery. Can’t we put them in stocks or send them to the tower, sort of language they’d understand?

2151 2018-09-08 16:05:05 they already have Ben Stocks ...World cant afford two kickass all-rounders  from one country 
2152 2018-09-08 16:03:39 Senator, separating kids from their parents is also not mentioned, nor is imprisoning these families for no reason (and no, upping private prison stocks is not a reason), is also not mentioned.
2153 2018-09-08 16:03:28 A nigga can name you every single Jordan made but if you ask about investments, 401k, stocks and bonds their nose starts to bleed
2154 2018-09-08 16:03:03 I didn’t buy the medal and I avoided buying any merch and Privé . I feel you though, I spent some of the money on CBX. SM doesn’t want their stocks to fall so they come out with useless merch because they know we buy anything.
2155 2018-09-08 16:02:41 Trumps going to increase the price of apple products.  I wonder if he has stocks in Samsung
2156 2018-09-08 16:02:16 M-E needs higher Crude prices to build their infra & feed termites to sustain jihad. Investment Banks,Retail & Stocks are bought with these profits. I'd rather like higher crude prices, that drive conventional auto industry to EVs. Tht would crash petrol prices & strangle petro$$
2157 2018-09-08 16:01:45 Haha it why it took Obumer so long to take credit for Trump’s accomplishments?    The stocks soared the next day Trump took the Presidency and continued to soar. 
 Only one man can take credit for today’s economy, that man is Trump!
2158 2018-09-08 16:01:25 Fact:under Obama, manufacturers moved to other countries.  People who had insurance lost it, and even on the exchange, couldn't afford it.  The minute Trump was President elect, stocks rose
2159 2018-09-08 16:01:17 Is it legal to make statements like this by leader of the world, by president of USA? Stocks are not for you and your mates dear mr president.
2160 2018-09-08 16:00:33 @Nike SURE you are getting in the news! But It will ButtBang your company! Keep looking to these activist idiot young people in your ad agency for these really cool ideas! You people are fucking idiots! Your stocks are showing it!
2161 2018-09-08 16:00:23 That can happen when they're paying shit wages and buying back stocks at a record pace...

2169 2018-09-08 15:57:55 You’re a moderate Democrat. I’m a Libertarian. You’re too focused on identity politics. I suspect you hate the Trump administration because of Trump himself, even though since the tax cuts, the economy, 401K, and stocks are booming. Observe results of policies and question media.
2170 2018-09-08 15:56:38 Will this be a $BABA specific event, or might it trigger a big correction in overvalued FAANG & $MAGA stocks ?

2174 2018-09-08 15:54:36 Sit down and be quiet heard enough of your BS you are delusional taking credit for what President Trump has done...you yourself said this is as good as it’s going to get remember...we were sinking the day Trump became President Stocks flew threw the roof .
2175 2018-09-08 15:52:57 Whole system crashed 2008. It 1hr away from complete collapse. QE's dump trillions into system keep alive & 0 interest rates so corps buy back their own stocks~ artificially look good. System will fail no matter what!!! If HRC President, no freedom. W/Trump we get keep freedom.
2176 2018-09-08 15:52:31 Kap isn’t even playing football and he’s still getting under peoples skin. Trumpeters got what they wanted and they are still not happy.  The face of a black man on and ad can make you burn your clothes? Your children are watching.  I bet you are not giving away those stocks.

2178 2018-09-08 15:51:12 Bump stocks make semi-automatics into full automatics. Most have them.  They don't need to be on our city streets or hunting areas.  Automatics are for military only (ask the inventor).  Bumpstocks are under $100 just for your edu.  Thank you for your commentary.  You're welcome
2179 2018-09-08 15:50:29 Trump was right, he said their stocks were plunging, and what do you know? THEIR STOCK IN THE WAREHOUSES IS GONE!
2180 2018-09-08 15:49:45 lol....yes, the major indicies will appear to suffering a mild correction while individual portfolios of various stocks get absolutely gutted!
2181 2018-09-08 15:48:26 Devaluation of yuan to near ten year lows is another key factor in poor dollar performance of China stocks. Lot of talk about $BABA cooking the books on Twitter, but for all we know Jack Ma had this decision planned for quite some time.
2182 2018-09-08 15:47:56 Bro he took a pussy ass hit. No wonder why Tesla stocks dropped.
2183 2018-09-08 15:47:18 You clearly don’t care for the short term investors in Tesla. Stock got hit quite a bit since your recent actions...or is it done on purpose to buy back stocks in Tesla and try make it private again 
2184 2018-09-08 15:47:02 I know this is a day late... but I feel bad for anyone than owns @Tesla stocks because anything stupid @elonmusk does, tesla stocks tank, It's just like having a bad relationship with your girl #SaturdayMorning
2185 2018-09-08 15:46:14 watching elon musk smoking a blunt is funny but the fact that teslas stocks dropped so much because of it makes it SO MUCH FUNNIER
2186 2018-09-08 15:46:06 What's funny is they say sales are up but their stocks are down.
2187 2018-09-08 15:45:21 funds have daily valuations, stocks are valued immediately with quarterly financials,. Private cos will produce once a year if lucky.
2188 2018-09-08 15:44:42 A prefer a quant approach to determine the best mix. Classically 12 months minus the most recent month is the momentum tool for stocks. People use much more near term as well. IMO you have to blend them somehow, and not put all your eggs in one basket
2189 2018-09-08 15:44:07 A man in a shop that only stocks Portuguese custard tarts is amazed that they don’t cater to vegans (but not nearly as amazed as the old Portuguese man behind the counter who can’t believe he was even asked).
2190 2018-09-08 15:43:36 The obvious answer is a lack of demand due to extreme wealth inequality. The bottom half of the country has no assets & only takes home around 15% of GDP. The bottom 80% control around 15% of the country's wealth. So demand for stocks/bonds is strong, but weak for goods/services.
2191 2018-09-08 15:43:28 $NFLX is one of the most market immune stocks out there— insulated from politics and tariffs, and too relied upon by millenials for entertainment. If the market gets bearish, remaining cable subs will flock to streamers at 1/20 the price. $DIS in same boat with more value at 110.
2192 2018-09-08 15:42:44 Nike may have had to produce some alternative facts to calm investors and avoid a massive sell off of their stocks.
2193 2018-09-08 15:42:34 Tesla's stocks are dropping AND we get memes of @elonmusk looking like the unbearable dipshit he is?? This is the best day of my life
2194 2018-09-08 15:41:48 stocks over humanity  jeez  #amjoy
2195 2018-09-08 15:40:48 He hasn't doubled anything for me. I am one of his idiotic trade war casualties as my 401k stocks are down over 20%. I am sure all his buddies have made a fortune on the same stocks by selling them just before he announced all the trade stuff.
2196 2018-09-08 15:40:37 taehyun’s little brother is so refreshing haha. and i knew it... yeomra was his father. lol and ma dong seok is funny with his stocks
2197 2018-09-08 15:40:20 Yep you are so right, we have now taken to running our country with hate, deceit, ridicule, and Nazism.  But the stocks are up and jobs are up thanks to 8 hard years of work by the Obama administration.  To think that at one time Lou, that you had scruples. I use to admire you.
2198 2018-09-08 15:39:02 if the midterms go to the Dems...we should have Obama get up and explain to his base why the sudden drop in stocks.  Notice I said base.  Trump supporters get it already.
2199 2018-09-08 15:38:29 EU fishermen are allowed to take more of our fish stocks from our territorial waters than we are. That's just for starters.
2200 2018-09-08 15:38:22 @Busisa74 Weldone to Url Pricing Committe. Roil cooking oil setting excellence pricing models in our economy and a better health factor, ideal for organic health profiles . Keep the stocks rolling .
2201 2018-09-08 15:38:17 Hmmm, is anyone watching trump’s stock transactions?  A quick (and unusual) dump of stocks would indicate that he’s up to something.
2202 2018-09-08 15:38:05 Probably discuss and lament the passing of the wild salmon stocks due to rampant industrialization of Burrard Inlet.
2203 2018-09-08 15:37:50 The market showed EVERYONE what they thought and stocks up 31% and Shareholders ARE EXTREMELY happy. But please keep burning the products you already purchased. That’ll show them!!!!!!

2205 2018-09-08 15:36:45 Due to the flooding at the track and grounds we have cancelled tonight’s racing program.

2206 2018-09-08 15:36:34 Usually shareholders worry more about the balance sheets. If the numbers are right then he can do handstands on the top of the Empire State in the buff for all they care. Board room turbulence & not great financials. Volatility isn't a stocks friend.

2208 2018-09-08 15:35:58 People forgetting about the things that outrage me. Bump stocks! DACA! The inauguration fund! Blaaurg!
2209 2018-09-08 15:35:54 What's this "we shit, paleface"!  Pay is stagnant, low raises if there are raises.  Big corporations are using their tax breaks to buy back stocks.  Bubba - stupid you are. We're coming after you and the GOP in a big badass way!

2211 2018-09-08 15:35:32 I use it to trade stocks and crypto with "fun money." I prefer it to my traditional brokerage account because of zero commission trades. They provide all the docs that make it very easy to fill out your taxes too. Do you have any specific questions about it?
2212 2018-09-08 15:35:09 I am holding MSFT AMZN GOOGL AAPL and NVDA.... FB, TSLA NFLX BABA have shown major weakness, and that should concern those long of large cap tech stocks. Microsoft, Apple, Google, Amazon are leaders in the space #MAGA
2213 2018-09-08 15:35:03 Corporations were making record profits before the tax cuts. The tax cuts just gave them extra money to buy back their stocks and sell them back out into the market to boost their already record profits. It has nothing to do with creating jobs. Any claim otherwise is delusional.
2214 2018-09-08 15:34:24 Once #DonaldTrump receives his #CriticalMinerals report/recommendations from @SecretaryZinke later this month, what will happen to #BatteryMetals stocks with US-based projects?
2215 2018-09-08 15:33:59 I see what you're saying but I don't think that will happen. As far as I can tell proper Bear Markets happen with Recession - I see no sign of that and with US Booming it's really unlikely. Stocks are good value in UK I think.
2216 2018-09-08 15:33:32 To be sure, emerging markets have cheapened relative to U.S. and European stocks. But investors should pay close attention to escalating trade tensions with China and the possibility of a weaker renminbi rippling through emerging markets.

2220 2018-09-08 15:31:41 Blame Trump!  We must resist low unemployment. We must resist a booming economy. We must resist great judges. Stocks are to higher we must resist. Wages going up we must resist!  #GTFOH #KAG2020 #Trump2020LANDSLIDE
2221 2018-09-08 15:31:13 Yeah I think you're right - amazes me anyone is buying at moment - Stocks will most likely be a  lot cheaper in a few weeks.
2222 2018-09-08 15:31:08 You realize that is his net worth, not actually how much money he has right? If he were to sell off some stocks of his net worth, enough to make a difference for all employees of his company, he would lose controlling interest and someone else would be running Amazon

2229 2018-09-08 15:23:44 Yes really. Do you not read the news? Unless you have stocks in the market that you’re profiting from, what’s going well? Clean Power Act is gone. We have lost respect from all our allies. Russia has infiltrated the GOP and our elections. Mass shootings are up.
2230 2018-09-08 15:23:19 I don’t get why when a CEO of a company smokes some weed on camera, his company’s stocks tank and executives from his company quit. Like who cares that much? It’s pot, and it’s legal. Get over yourselves.
2231 2018-09-08 15:23:08 Perfect, Let’s talk price.  What was GDP of China and US then v now?  Per capita real median income in US and China now v then?  Relative military power of both then & now?  China stocks v US stocks then v now?
2232 2018-09-08 15:22:39 It didn't work any time because the companies all rebought stocks and inflated their stock value.

2234 2018-09-08 15:22:06 When enough stocks fall, & fall fast enough, their are stock shorts & derivatives which have to be paid. Derivatives in world are estimated be from 1~3 Quadrillion. The debts in world, with having pay derivatives will collapse system. It's just a matter of when & soon.

2237 2018-09-08 15:21:33 The Johannesburg Stock Exchanged has set-up an "Empowerment Segment" where shares in Black Economic Empowerment schemes are traded. This is what Black Business should have done a long time ago. Set up an Exchange for trading in Black owned stocks. JSE beat them to it

2240 2018-09-08 15:20:07 I believe the two most important rules in investing are:

- Never invest money you can not afford to lose;
- Keep up to date with regard to your investments.

2242 2018-09-08 15:19:37 I just purchased my account so I will start trading this week live. I’ve been unsuccessful on my own and lost thousands and thousands of dollars. My fault though for jet getting educated and jumping in live account trading low float risky stocks of the bat
2243 2018-09-08 15:19:19 The reason is simple. Musk represents a lot more than just himself on a JR show. 1st, the man is a billionaire. 2nd, he has investors & stocks based on Space X and Tesla that determine the value of not only those companies but the future of same. Must appear stable at all times.
2244 2018-09-08 15:19:07 Pot stocks.
2245 2018-09-08 15:18:46 You're wrong again Irene. Digital stuff is in the digital era. What if I have stocks. Stocks are digital. What if I have bonds. What if I have palladium miners stocks. All are digital.
2246 2018-09-08 15:17:20 Friday would be a good time for @apple to offer @elonmusk a buyout. Let’s see how the stocks respond Monday.
2247 2018-09-08 15:16:21 @NickCannon you did nothing righteous fam don’t get it twisted we all aren’t so ignorant. All you did was promote consumerism. The move was to buy @Nike stocks not fuckin socks my guy. The homeless would have accepted less expensive socks & cash to go in pocket.
2248 2018-09-08 15:14:58 I have just finished  The Candidate by @alexnunns .  Truly blown away by it and urge all @UKLabour  members (and everyone else) to read it. Also please request that your local library or @ideastores stocks a copy as everyone should have access to this book.

2253 2018-09-08 15:13:26 Doing great??  They've lost 4 Billion in value stocks. 

You obviously are not a business man. It’s stupid for any company to take sides. Alienate customers. That’s dollars lost that you’ll never retrieve.  Thus is why stock value dropped.
2254 2018-09-08 15:13:05 It’s a whole new swag cuhh. We ain’t laughing stocks no more. Those days are over with

2266 2018-09-08 15:07:59 Help me see what “we’re “ saying? Nike made a deal not only with Colin but the NFL also this all about profit and nick dumb ass in cahoots promoting consumerism and not his ppl being investors. Buy stocks not fkn socks.

2268 2018-09-08 15:07:28 All kinds of companies have a thing for blending truth and fiction together as one. They always got a fascinating share of doing it each time. Profits change differently. Their stocks. Their slogans, mottos, marketing techniques and tactics, profit margins, jobs, and contracts.

2278 2018-09-08 15:02:43 How to use the wallet would have been investing in the stocks not socks. Stop promoting consumerism. Could have catered to way more ppl in need without buying a $20 pair of socks.

2282 2018-09-08 15:01:31 Guess all them good old boys better get stocked up,on condoms or be ready for abstinence.  Maybe now is the time to buy condom stocks?
2283 2018-09-08 15:01:20 You mispealled “Dumb”. It was a dumb ass move. The homeless would have taken no name brand socks & $15 cash to put in their pocket. This is the promotion of consumerism. Invest in @Nike by buying stocks not fkn socks. Teach your ppl a different way to support the cause.
2284 2018-09-08 15:01:18 if smoking weed will drive down the stock from idiotic investors, then elon musk needs to smoke more weed. It will help those who want tesla stocks to buy up more. Your article is click bait by the way, Elon explicitly said he does't habitually smoke weed. Terrible journalism
2285 2018-09-08 15:00:09 Now he'll get those stocks he wanted to buy back cheaper. And I will, too 
2286 2018-09-08 15:00:02 We talked about this one already....Wealth is created by stocks/bonds/oil wells, land ownership, home ownership....not salary "income", as was defined by the study...warren Buffet and bill gates did not QUALIFY as ever being in the top 10%, because they got paid $1/year. LOL
2287 2018-09-08 14:59:44 Elon isn't perfect. They have an issue with positive money flow that keeps getting worse at Tesla. They can't keep up with orders. One of the worst stocks to invest in my opinion. And he keeps getting negative press. They don't wanna deal with his antics.
2288 2018-09-08 14:58:40 When fraud is institutionalized then natural law takes effect. Loan/ debt games...Western capitalism is in death spiral. Get out of cash/bonds/stocks...buy gold , silver . And for interim transition to new system buy bitcoins/litecoins...
2289 2018-09-08 14:58:05 On top that your promoting your ppl you say you’re for to be consumers of a company and not investors. Should have bought stocks and not socks moron. The homeless would have taken $15cash and a $5 pair of socks.

We could only wish that all TRUMP'S worst NIGHTMARE IS that he smoked a joint! America would welcome that

2304 2018-09-08 14:50:20 the gains would be much more substantial if investors werent selling their stocks given any opportunity; one of many reason we are early in a secular bull market period

2316 2018-09-08 14:43:39 If the stock market plummets, make sure you have cash on hand, it just means stocks will be on “sale”. I’m all for an End-of-Summer Sale on blue chip stocks.

2325 2018-09-08 14:37:41 The US has always been a nation that benefited from globalization. The fact is we never were self feeding. You can’t pull apart the companies, stocks, raw products, banks etc and only deal with US organization. We need these other countries and we need their money.
2326 2018-09-08 14:37:39 Book is good read with good points and it is true that an educated investor based on personal risk tolerance can make profit in any market. It’s more timing, charts, company, and I add several other keys I use. One characteristic is falling markets take down good stocks with it.
2327 2018-09-08 14:36:54 Crash ahead this year or may slip into next, then Fed and global CBs reverse policy to stimulus on steroids sending risk assets such as stocks to a new blow-off top / high, then the collapse and reset of the global monetary system in 2020/21. Global Depression. Just mho.

2332 2018-09-08 14:35:00 @jensaiden hey buddy. Im an homeless 57 yr old out of work carpenter. Housing crisis. If you have a wigit.

2334 2018-09-08 14:34:39 I can just imagine the look on the H&R Block tax preparer’s face when he sees capital gains for cannabis stocks ...#becomethewatercoolertalk
2335 2018-09-08 14:34:33 My father in law also bought some crypto (through me it is). I asked him, because he had invested in stocks many years ago, if the interest was 10% or more yearly. He laught and said i wish....hahaha...i told him i wouldn’t sell before it went 1000%  he looked at me as  haha
2336 2018-09-08 14:34:24 gotta buy tesla stocks.. he will get sober sooner or later
2337 2018-09-08 14:34:21 Impeachment and public stocks for two weeks, please.
2338 2018-09-08 14:32:12 8)Indexes were not invented to be investments, simply supposed to report performance of a large group of stocks. At 1 time, we had no idea what the “market” was doing/had done. Indexes first solved this. Became investments b/c of futility of active management, n/b they were ideal

2340 2018-09-08 14:30:35 Who cares if @elonmusk smoked #Marijuana ! What's more important is can he get the right team in place to keep producing affordable #ElectricCars on a pace that meets the demand. This is what the #business #investors should be focusing on in my humble opinion #StockMarket #stocks

2344 2018-09-08 14:28:03 The prices of weed stocks would be sent skyrocketing  
2345 2018-09-08 14:27:32 Interest comes from savings,  dividends from stocks.  Your interest from savings is set by the Fed not Trump.
2346 2018-09-08 14:27:17 Paper stocks on a whole have been indiction for over two weeks now..
2347 2018-09-08 14:26:30 One of the most the bewildering turn of events in the value investing community is, why on the earth is Berkshire Hathaway aggressively uploading AAPL INC stocks. Stacks are exceedingly high. It goes against every fibre of the high esteemed conglomerate.
2348 2018-09-08 14:24:34 4)R^2 to the market isn’t a sufficient determinate of active/passive. S&P 500 (you say “Index”) has a +0.993 correlation with S&P 500, the DFA US Adjusted Market 1 Index (“Core 1”) has +0.992! It’s had higher returns though because it overweights higher expected returning stocks
2349 2018-09-08 14:24:33 OMG SANA UMABOT YUNG IPON KOOO UNLI STOCKS NAMAN PALA
2350 2018-09-08 14:23:50 @Doodisgirl but recovery DID begin under Obama! Upon announcement that Trump won the election, stocks began to soar!
2351 2018-09-08 14:23:30 Some thoughts for you. To motivate, contemplate, challenge, inspire.  More to life than stocks.  May we push each other up. May we pull each other up.  #SaturdayMotivation
2352 2018-09-08 14:23:13 Agreed. I’d own gold, stocks, real assets because all these paper currencies are worthless and gonna get worthless-er! I get cryptos and their utility (I’ve read a bunch on them). I just haven’t made the jump to own them yet. Fascinating times we are in today. Have a good day.
2353 2018-09-08 14:22:03 .@elonmusk. rename your profile as Elon Kumar, Post a tweet "I am hindu now" and watch your stocks raise back
2354 2018-09-08 14:20:22 They already bought the shoes bro burning them will not affect supply and demand how much they currently sell does and they still going dumb as long as you know it’s a good time to buy stocks  lemme hold a million
2355 2018-09-08 14:19:03 After going to China and reading about it I decided to stay away from Chinese stocks. The Jack Ma story seemed almost artificial, as if he was implanted and promoted by the gov. His story and personality seemed a little too good to me... $baba
2356 2018-09-08 14:17:08 Those stocks are already coming in. Look at any supermarket. Grapes from S. Africa etc. Etc are there shortages of grapes now? Why do you think those grapes won't make it to Britain after brexit?
2357 2018-09-08 14:16:45 Trump’s base is holding strong because he’s held to his values and promises and because full employment with rising wages is at hand.  Stocks up $7 trillion is nice, too.
2358 2018-09-08 14:15:15 Lol stocks go up and down because of supply and demand not the worth of the company and you don’t know if Nike will drop ck and even if they do they didn’t lose any business matter fact their online sales going crazy rn as we speak but you got the answers bro
2359 2018-09-08 14:15:07 That's penny stocks $nbev. If you lose you lose shit  ton. Scary n pure gamble.
 Big boy stocks you can hold and wait for a few cycles.
2360 2018-09-08 14:14:08 Stocks? Not so much
2361 2018-09-08 14:13:43 apple stocks rise by 30%.
2362 2018-09-08 14:13:14 Someone may be u buy stocks before posting on telegram and exit once foolish investor checks in....
2363 2018-09-08 14:11:43 Very very happy with our backmen stocks. Zerk,Ridley and Redman just to name a few.
2364 2018-09-08 14:11:08 Hope it’s not like gold where they say miners lead the commodity.  Some say sept is usually weak in sept for U stocks.  Some say miners in all sectors getting hit so it’s finally spilling into uranium miners
2365 2018-09-08 14:10:30 Are you using stocks or etfs?

2368 2018-09-08 14:09:12 I'm flabbergasted that Tesla's stock price dropped after Musky smoked a blunt with Joe Rogan. Like I'm gonna go cop some stocks real quick??

2371 2018-09-08 14:06:58 @RockstarGames a rock so what's up with the night club stocks not going up in GTA online ?
2372 2018-09-08 14:05:47 I forgot about those early days of Obama! Such a shocking disaster! What was the thing about all those GM stocks and credit cards failing?? Or something like that? Failure and misery for so many.
2373 2018-09-08 14:05:41 2.50 next support if 50dmA gives way.  2.25 is 30 wk ma currently so if uranium stocks continue to weaken them are the areas.  Will it get there? Who knows.
2374 2018-09-08 14:05:33 [NOTICE] All Army Bomb Ver. 3 buyers, our supplier still hasn't given us a notice if she has secured all 70 stocks that we reserved from her but her last update was that she is still working on it and that she's doing her best to accommodate us.
2375 2018-09-08 14:05:31 the people dropping their Tesla stocks should look into investing in cannabis.

just sayin.
2376 2018-09-08 14:04:58 I believe Goldman’s stocks are the ones that should be dropping 5% if that was true...
2377 2018-09-08 14:04:45 Imagine if some loon pulled a trigger? The USN & EAF battering the crap out of each other at practically point blank range on Suez canal? If someone is planning that, can they let me know, I have a plot to short shipping & logistic stocks & make a fortune on the markets.
2378 2018-09-08 14:04:24 RT TheBullBull "tajindermenon Yeah, FMCG stocks are very richly valued"
2379 2018-09-08 14:04:02 honestly even if Tesla did lose 17% in stocks the fucking madman known as Elon Musk is gonna probably sell lightsabers and make the money back

he's fucking insane i love him

2383 2018-09-08 14:01:34 People were selling houses in dot-com boom. People were taking three mortgages to buy stocks for 2007 crash. People are taking ten mortgages to buy Amazon now. People ARE ALWAYS investing more then they could loose! Crypto is far from being exception.
2384 2018-09-08 14:00:26 Yeah, FMCG stocks are very richly valued
2385 2018-09-08 14:00:06 @jimcramer hypocritical ?@$?. You pump marijuana stocks one week and question a man's stability because he smoked something that is 100% legal.

What are you hiding in your closet...
2386 2018-09-08 13:59:57 Good luck in the season opener tonight @FifeFlyers! Nothing like a rivalry game to kick things off! How about a little ohhhhh @nucci39 tonight?? #COYF

2390 2018-09-08 13:57:02 Bob Doll, Chief Equity Strategist at @NuveenInv and Sub-Advisor for the Evolve Active US Core Equity ETF (TSX: CAPS) joins @BNNBloomberg to discuss the markets, how growth stocks have crushed value and reasons to favour value stocks in some sectors now.
2391 2018-09-08 13:56:54 Editors note.  That should read, "in case it looks like or is rumored to have happened"  Load up on Ratheon stocks, might as well make some money, you can't stop this shit.
2392 2018-09-08 13:56:38 FACT: You even would have made more money with New York Times Co. stock than you would have if you had invested in high-tech stocks such as Facebook (up 62%), Amazon (up 118%), Apple (up 71%), or Google parent company Alphabet (up 46%).
2393 2018-09-08 13:56:10 Yes, I have seen both mine and my husband's income go up, plus bonus.  Fact is most stocks have gone up, It's the Dems who are on the side of M-13 and illegals and causing issues with the hearings for confirmation.
2394 2018-09-08 13:56:10 The problem is, that you can't possibly watch everything, that could indicate possible massive interest from the masses. In crypto it's easier, but everyone knows about stocks already.
2395 2018-09-08 13:55:56 Please don't short my USA stocks that I have puts on! I would also STRONGLY encourage you to short the 2 CSE stocks I hold. Please do it!
2396 2018-09-08 13:55:22 Good luck with that. Massachusetts, even with the threat  of life in prison, can't even get their citizens to give up their bump stocks. You really think people are going to tell the gov't guns they may or may not own.
2397 2018-09-08 13:54:37 Yes! Wall Street is made up of “Trumps” influencing markets for personal and corporate gain while actual citizens vote with their wallets/hearts/conscience. That’s how sales can be up and stocks can be down at the same time. It highlights the real economic disparity in the west.
2398 2018-09-08 13:54:25 (1) While in #SF I saw so much wealth but so much homelessness & mental illness. Then in the Sky Lounge getting ready to fly home, a man was on the phone touting the hundreds of millions of dollars worth of stocks he just acquired while reading Mansion magazine. He could change
2399 2018-09-08 13:53:57 You better get started because most those stocks are going up! Talk’s cheap!
2400 2018-09-08 13:53:35 I read comments on yahoo said this isn't completely accurate, as far as their stocks
2401 2018-09-08 13:50:04 Investment Tips: A good stock is a good investment.” “Good” stocks are those of either (1) leading companies with satisfactory records; or (2) any well-financed business, which has especially attractive prospects of increased future earnings.
2402 2018-09-08 13:50:04 I'm not in the 1% and I can now retire 2 years earlier.  My stocks are up as high as 87% and this year I will pay capitol gains.  Under Obama my stocks were losing money.  My IRA and 401K are booming, My business now pays $4K less a year in taxes and I'm under 100K in salary.
2403 2018-09-08 13:50:03 Nobody I know has investments in the stockmarket. My retirement pension is not enough to invest in such things as stocks.
2404 2018-09-08 13:49:53 <><>;; I might have to close cosmania PO L-LMAO
you guys are gonna finish my stocks before the convention even starts
2405 2018-09-08 13:49:46 Je commande un produit qu’on m’assure me livrer dans les 5 jours. Je le reçois 3 semaines plus tard. Et quand je veux exercer mon droit de rétractation je me rends compte que je dois acquitter 20€ de frais de transport pour des stocks situés en Italie. @UFCquechoisir
2406 2018-09-08 13:49:38 It's all PR man.  After Musk smoked, his stocks dropped.  When players smoke, NFLs stock drops.  Soon enough society will catch up and weed won't cause irrational reaction
2407 2018-09-08 13:49:37 Stocks dropped and online sales went up? Wow!
2408 2018-09-08 13:49:31 @Nike stocks up again at the closing yesterday . As a serviceman I support Nike and Colin Kaepernick
2409 2018-09-08 13:48:41 I thought you were investing such as stocks. Thank you.
2410 2018-09-08 13:48:21 Or $COL or $LMT or $MMM. Man some DOW stocks look sexy. Especially the weekly charts.
2411 2018-09-08 13:47:33 Friday was a rough day for $SPX #stocks $CBRE, $FL, $LYB and $TROW as they all broke and closed below the 200 day moving average #trading
2412 2018-09-08 13:46:35 What are you looking at?  Definitely not their stocks.
2413 2018-09-08 13:46:19 I need more stocks to invest in
2414 2018-09-08 13:46:16 I stopped reading after “play the stock market” hope youre crushing it in when you play your penny stocks.
2415 2018-09-08 13:45:20 To back up your plans for a no deal that’s why and to join the party if that happened. As for lies, trying to bully, scare, lies x a million over finance and starvation and medicine stocks, made me cringe, complete fabrication of the nations plight  and the nation now knows it
2416 2018-09-08 13:44:42 C'est ça, faudrait voir en magasin si il reste des stocks mais je pense pas
2417 2018-09-08 13:43:52 ASCENDANT FACTION stocks climb despite troubling geopolitical headlines
2418 2018-09-08 13:43:32 You seriously expect me to believe that when the stocks have plummeted? I will NEVER buy a pair of Nike's.
2419 2018-09-08 13:43:15 They don't really care about the Chinese stock market. A tiny minority owns shares in China. Real estate another matter. Whereas US stocks = 150% of GDP and the most Americans in history own shares now. What happens when the US stock market crashes?

2422 2018-09-08 13:40:07 The lies!  Nike sales and stocks are actually up. Get your facts straight!
2423 2018-09-08 13:40:00 Such anecdotal information pales in comparison to pervasive data, led by the falling labor participation rate and housing stocks, sales, starts all in decline.
2424 2018-09-08 13:39:52 Pharma stocks gained the most during the week and Realty stocks lost the most during the week.
2425 2018-09-08 13:39:50 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
2426 2018-09-08 13:39:33 Stocks go down: wages stagnant. Stocks rise: wages stagnant.
2427 2018-09-08 13:38:29 Wow.. Like trumps base is claiming about Nike stocks, it looks like your stocks are down too. Ur not so much of a throroughbred, more like a a horse and a donkey created you. A GOVERNMENT MULE.
2428 2018-09-08 13:37:29 Learn to read tweets carefully. Read every word. Then get ready to troll. I never discuss illiquid stocks. My views are clearly on mutual funds. Read again.

If you merely want to troll and make a sight of yourself without reading and understanding a viewpoint, I have no problem.
2429 2018-09-08 13:36:46 Friends, Harry Potter and Dr. Who Trivial Pursuit now in store. And new to us, the Mega Edition monopoly. But hurry stocks are limited.

2431 2018-09-08 13:35:19 Nope it makes you smart! I invest in stocks and real estate  a pair of shoes isn’t going to pay for my retirement. I actually agree and think it makes you a really smart findom 
2432 2018-09-08 13:35:11 Oh yeah remember when Osama was saying that he didn't know how Trump was going to bring all those jobs back to the US. On election night msm was pointing to how bad stocks were and  Trump would make it worse. Change your panties already!!
2433 2018-09-08 13:34:20 @BoredElonMusk Be kind to the poor and God will bless you. The Tesla name will be held in great honor. Stocks will rise faster than the speed of sound. God loves you. I love you. Listen to your heart. That's where God lives. Investers don't dictate the future of a man.

2442 2018-09-08 13:31:43 Stocks go down 2% ALL THE TIME as I’m sure you know as a sophisticated market participant.  Nike isn’t going anywhere regardless of the idiots out there burning their gear.  It’s just as likely they’ll benefit from this as be hurt by it.  Idiots like Travis are just that.
2443 2018-09-08 13:31:38 In trading, u don't need to trade and look for new stocks everyday. what u need is repeatable patterns with high probability and when u see that u take the position and stick with it.
2444 2018-09-08 13:31:11 It seems to me by changing the warhead to C variant is enough for full upgrade and a control cabin on small technical for programming/targeting .  They could uplift their old stocks quite easy

Very dangerous stuff
2445 2018-09-08 13:28:54 They be putting me on stocks and investments in property. I’m like brahhh y’all niggas smart lmfao
2446 2018-09-08 13:27:48 Why are my stocks plummeting right now?
2447 2018-09-08 13:27:25 I agree. I’m watching a couple of stocks closely next week.
2448 2018-09-08 13:26:53 So Queen Mathematics again show her power. $btc is 24/7 market (168h/ week) Stock is 8/5 market (40h/ week) that is 4,2x faster. Now look - 43y/9y is 4,7x. Not $btc will follow stocks, #stocks will follow #crypto. Patience.
2449 2018-09-08 13:26:53 Yeah...well seeing as the stock market has nothing to do with the commodities floor, you might want to take a second look at those stocks. #TheMoreYouKnow
2450 2018-09-08 13:26:12 Keep watching those stocks baby because sales are exploding. Watch the climb. You know you can tell anything about stocks judging from The first couple days. Lol.
2451 2018-09-08 13:25:05 sir,how do you scan stocks ?any algo?
2452 2018-09-08 13:24:28 Lol, what is that money invested in? Stocks? (Bobby) Bonds? Oil (Can Boyd)?
2453 2018-09-08 13:23:10 Yes, it's tricky but has to be addressed for all stocks
2454 2018-09-08 13:21:03 Why is Kell not fought a decent 147lbs since Spence? Even just a b class fighter? Kell doesn't have the balls to risk lowering his stocks when he does fight khan, why does his name never come up as top 10 welterweights? Kell you're UK level at best
2455 2018-09-08 13:20:44 The economy is not better. It's pretty much the same as it has been for the last 5 years. Stocks doing well b/c deregs and tax cuts have put oodles into the 1% pockets. Most Americans do NOT own stock. The NYSE is NOT the economy.
And safer? Nope. Not even. Ask any US diplo.
2456 2018-09-08 13:20:16 Yes, and your option is to sell your stocks or quit using the service.  Again, go start Alex Jones Twitter.  You can do that. Does he still have a website - oh, that’s right, he does.
2457 2018-09-08 13:19:55 Really?  But their stocks plunged into the toilet. Can't have it both ways CBS....

2459 2018-09-08 13:15:50 If true, economy would be worse now. President Trump has lowered taxes, deregulated, etc. Stocks should be crashing. Liberals want higher taxes, resulting in less jobs, higher costs, lower wages, not to pay down debt, but to pay for more programs.
2460 2018-09-08 13:15:44 I am surprised you dare show your face, after your attempts to keep the UK in the UK. Our fisherman backed leaving, so they can get back their fishing rights & be in control of UK fish stocks. You do not want that, you want the EU to control our fishing waters & who can fish them

2465 2018-09-08 13:12:08 So then why are our largest manufacturing stocks losing trillions of dollars of value this year?  IBM, GM. Ford US Steel.  All way down in value.  Something doesn't add up.
2466 2018-09-08 13:11:59 Great, let's see what happens. If it Plummets, it allows us to pick up stocks at really low prices then when it rebounds, as it always does, maybe we'll have the middle class back again

2468 2018-09-08 13:11:40 $BABA traded $158.60 AH and after the news...early indication of reaction. Guessing this will be catalyst for bottoming of China stocks...but where that bottom is we'll have to wait and see.
2469 2018-09-08 13:11:36 I don’t use ETFs for the construction of the data/statistics/rankings of this data.

2470 2018-09-08 13:11:05 @elonmusk look, I get it, for you money ain't shit. Mad respect for what you've built. But to me, to my family, it's important. Shit, it's down right paramount. So if you blow smoke, cause stocks to fall and still be okay, then could you cut me a fat ass check please? Seriously.

2480 2018-09-08 13:03:31 Why did Tesla stocks drop when @elonmusk went on the @joerogan experience and smoked a joint?! That is litreally one of the coolest things you could hear about a ceo doing, of all the things to make into a scandal they make that into one? Come on like 
2481 2018-09-08 13:03:23 This is a very significant move in European nat gas prices. Some stocks have barely moved yet ... I put that down to lack of press coverage, fewer platforms monitoring #NBP #TTF .Expect cheaper names with decent gas production to start shifting soon as mkt does the work/analysis

2486 2018-09-08 12:58:30 We get it at the FW lakes near me too & I agree w u that Brexit will make no difference to law enforcement & won't solve that. OTOH what I do usually find, is that majority of anglers aren't that fussed about the more significant climatebreakdown factors on all fish stocks here.
2487 2018-09-08 12:56:39 Big deal stocks go up and down and they are pretty much even now and will be higher soon enough. If you were smart you buy some nike stock before it goes back up.
2488 2018-09-08 12:56:27 The 08 wall st financial bailout was disdainful to those who had little to minimal stocks or monetary instruments and a godsend to those who took unprecedented and in some cases illegal risk with client finances and lost.  We the people are still the wall street casino's bank.
2489 2018-09-08 12:56:00 You do realize Nike sales and stocks are up right?
2490 2018-09-08 12:55:09 How much has unemployment full under trump? How much under obama? How much have stocks gained under trump? How much under obama?
2491 2018-09-08 12:54:38 Not all stocks are doing very well. For those that are, it is because folks have their fingers crossed that this con man will continue to strip back regulations and throw them tax parachutes. It’s gross.
2492 2018-09-08 12:54:22 This is the week all the 'jews' locked into the China supply chain start losing money and their stocks on Wall St start going down.  I'm just a speculator and I'm buying lots and lots of puts !

2497 2018-09-08 12:52:55 Absolutely Sir, liquidity sab ka baap hai, thn gdp gire ya bare, crude kahin Bhi ho, currency kahi bhi, Indian market only bull run. So I think why analyst come on tv and say about this that valuations, trade war, currency. Its simple stocks go up by liquidity and DII have that.
2498 2018-09-08 12:51:28 Stocks and other securities will eventually be secured by Bitcoin.  I fully expect this.

2508 2018-09-08 12:44:57 Many bulls still in denial mode....we are not immune to external shocks and that worries me a lot.... Holding only mutual funds cut my direct exposure to stocks 8 months back.
2509 2018-09-08 12:43:42 Slush Puppie stocks hit all new highs last week as craft breweries collectively ordered 12,500 machines for their tap rooms. Curiously, no syrups were ordered, with a memo on the invoice noting, "We got this covered."
2510 2018-09-08 12:43:05 Is that a good thing for his stocks?
2511 2018-09-08 12:41:24 Any thing is indeed possible. But if there's a hard Brexit, I think it's more likely they'll put such people in the stocks and fire rotten vegetables at them...
2512 2018-09-08 12:41:00 Times like last week are best spent making lists.

What sectors are green when everything else is red?

What stocks are holding strong when the rest aren’t?

The stocks that are defended the best are normally the strongest movers when the general market cooperates.

2520 2018-09-08 12:34:03 Is that so? Suppose I invest in 10 stocks and only 1 of them is responsible for the gain while the remaining 9 plummet, does that not reflect on poor stock selection skills?
2521 2018-09-08 12:33:31 Good question. Likely not. Just far too many other stocks to pick from.

2549 2018-09-08 12:12:29 You know we live in the old world when stocks for Nike and Tesla dropped because they stood up for black rights or smoked some weed. Or is change not the change that America is looking for?
2550 2018-09-08 12:12:28 Stocks are continuing to fall, the sweet shop workers isn't enough for liberals now they say buy because minority's are attacked by diverse police departments. All criminals are pursued regardless of color.

2553 2018-09-08 12:11:00 #Stocks,#Indexes ...is that something has changed. We won't be so complacent should such signal characteristics, broadly interpreted, repeat.
2554 2018-09-08 12:10:11 Hi Sir, Screener is not a recommendation site. Its a tool to help you with your research and find new stocks.
2555 2018-09-08 12:10:03 Is this before or after their stocks plummeted 4.5 billion with a B.
2556 2018-09-08 12:08:55 Fraudulent stocks like $OSTK are like driving through a fog. Sometimes the fog lifts but you never know when it come back.
2557 2018-09-08 12:06:11 These Chinese stocks are and always have been a fucking headache. Tough to lay off when there rocketing higher, but in every cycle , in the end there’s always drama.
2558 2018-09-08 12:05:58 Unless shown that stocks of companies run by CEOs who smoke weed and down whiskey while being interviewed on a popular medium are good investments, many investors will assume Musk potentially isn't stable enough to lead Tesla to success. That's why the stock is down on this news.
2559 2018-09-08 12:05:40 #Stocks,#Indexes Recent sharp declines WERE signaled, by sub-criterion signals. The automatic conclusion, exogenous (the news) amplification, is suspect in full view of the signals, namely, a peculiar mix of very high and very low fidelity features. A more cautious conclusion...
2560 2018-09-08 12:03:28 Sir normally how long do you hold such stocks? Or these are short term 1-3 month trades?
2561 2018-09-08 12:02:27 Everyone who pulled out of Elon Musk stocks because he took a hit of tobacco mixed with weed on the JRE is idiotic.

Wages go up when efficiency increases, but staff is reduced at the same time, more output for the same $$.

2589 2018-09-08 11:35:53 Y’all SO JOKEY lmfao ppl really dropped Tesla’s stocks bc Musk smoked a cigar w a little weed in it???? It was NOT a full blunt. Secondly, y’all really that opposed to ppl enjoying their time that u gotta ruin this man’s career for weed???? Weed???? I’m disgusted in y’all
2590 2018-09-08 11:35:36 Hello! Maraming developed countries mababa ang inflation rate. And look at the overall economy. Peso to dollar at a low. Stocks on the red. Inflation. Ikaw ba nakapag economics class, to begin with?
2591 2018-09-08 11:35:24 Hi there bud. I would like your thoughts on $CLDR? They reported a stellar quarter and RAISED FULL YEAR GUIDANCE. Bank of America upgraded them to $45 price target. Thank you in advance
2592 2018-09-08 11:35:23 thinking DJT is dangerous MEANS you just don’t know facts. You perish for lack of knowledge. Hate blinds your eyes to facts.  Would you acknowledge that he’s doing great things for our country? Because he is, more than any POTUS in history. GDP, STOCKS, JOBS ECONOMY matter, study
2593 2018-09-08 11:34:27 I bought some random stocks last year and forgot about em. Looked today and my return is bigger than my investment 
2594 2018-09-08 11:32:38 Good to know, not sure that everyone feels the same though with the way his stocks are looking
2595 2018-09-08 11:32:37 Not entirely, one of 3 parts.
Also EFSF funds lost, about 10bn, ANFA and SMP profits lost, and more I don’t even remember right now.
Not to mention the obliteration of minor greek portfolios with mainly bank stocks
2596 2018-09-08 11:31:24 Hi there. I would like to know your thoughts on $CLDR? Thank you in advance
2597 2018-09-08 11:31:23 Although compared to the West, there is a sharp drop in Chinese market, buying stocks here is not a contrarian move!
I have learnt that major market moves always last longer and go much further than most participants even imagine.
2598 2018-09-08 11:29:36 If you’re so anti-corporation why don’t you ask your employer to divest its endowment ($4.3 billion) funds in corporate stocks and bonds?  You know where they get the money to pay your salary.

2601 2018-09-08 11:26:22 I just needed some new stocks for research  thanks
2602 2018-09-08 11:21:46 These knee-jerk forms of protest that increasingly revolve around destroying purchased goods or tanking stocks perfectly demonstrates the sinister pervasiveness of late stage capitalism in our modern value system.
2603 2018-09-08 11:21:43 What have you done about school shootings?? Bump Stocks??
2604 2018-09-08 11:19:21 They reported their sales were up. But they also reported their stocks took a hit. Value dropped  4 Billion.
2605 2018-09-08 11:16:13 2/2 You do plenty of complaining, but offer no solutions - and you HAVE to have an alternative better solution if you are going to say something should not be done. We could bring back stocks?
2606 2018-09-08 11:16:11 I’m thinking about going with vanguard which is who I go through for 401k from work but they also have other things such as college savings and whatever you put in, goes into stocks and invest
2607 2018-09-08 11:13:56 Stocks close slightly slower, trimming earlier losses
2608 2018-09-08 11:13:47 Don’t be a fool, don’t underestimate anyone and remember who you are and your self worth.
2609 2018-09-08 11:13:35 le bon bail c’est de faire ses stocks directement dans les fermes ça coûte même pas le quart du prix en ville
2610 2018-09-08 11:11:36 I get that but if this was any of Musk’s employees they’d have been fired on the spot. Stocks dropping won’t hurt them in the long run. They’ll recover because Musk is worshipped by nerds.
2611 2018-09-08 11:10:27 Nike stocks this week down from $82.79 to $80.30, down 3%
2612 2018-09-08 11:09:00 Why is this news? Such reactionary garbage. If the stocks falling has anything to do with that, the sellers are hypersensitive douchebags.
2613 2018-09-08 11:08:42 I don't understand why everything says or does @elonmusk affects @Tesla stocks, why can't people separate personal life with business?
2614 2018-09-08 11:07:12 You know why they jumped 31% ? because their stocks dropped like crazy after they released that news.  So Nike reacted with a 50% off everything in the store to get people buying again.
2615 2018-09-08 11:05:52 Was only thinking yesterday, when I started I found myself in stocks that would go up a significant % and I still would find myself loosing. When I questioned what I was doing wrong it changed, Listening to noise “only loses sell for 50% “ on lse, meant only losers won lol
2616 2018-09-08 11:05:11 .
Corporate governance is going to cause a boycott backlash of epic proportions - once western populations grasp the corporatocracy control over their lives, corporate control is finished - stocks will dive and this new corporate globalist empire will fall.  [Nike] is an example
2617 2018-09-08 11:05:09 Almost all consumption stocks commands "crazy" valuations, 
so many quality small caps available at attractive valuations 

Focus on:
ROI/ROII

2618 2018-09-08 11:05:03 Stock market & stocks crash when #Governments & corporations practice #leftwing politics do not sure how #Nike didn’t see it coming
2619 2018-09-08 11:04:06 Remaining pairs. Usually there’s no stocks it just goes live with zero. They are sold in store first. 
2620 2018-09-08 11:01:24 If you mean generic as in common across one model, as opposed to common across multiple manufacturers, then yes they are. 

But it still costs a lot of money to hold large stocks of the 10,000 or more components used in a single model line - that's why JIT was introduced.

2625 2018-09-08 10:58:09 I’ve done pretty ok with stocks over the years A handful of racists in the US won’t put me off. Majority of those racists need to get out of their trailers and see some of the world instead of being brainwashed by Fox News 
2626 2018-09-08 10:57:14 Correct me if I'm wrong Nike.
Someone over inflated the price of your stock, "pumped it up".
Hired Kapernick as a "spokes person", knowing full well what would happen to the stock. Of course they dumped the stocks in the weeks leading up to this.
Pump and Dump scheme
2627 2018-09-08 10:56:35 Tesla’s stocks apparently went down 9-10% after Elon musk smoked some pot. I really hate this world
2628 2018-09-08 10:56:06 Not enough money for food? Invest in stocks. You get free steak dinners at the shareholder's meetings.
2629 2018-09-08 10:53:19 Oh why waiting for the stocks
2630 2018-09-08 10:51:49 So the stocks didn’t get high. Hmmm!

2640 2018-09-08 10:39:48 Pues si te miras un poco los fundamentales fliaparas jaja . Tiene cash recién hecha la ampliación de 150mn$ y capitaliza 750mn$. Recién aprobado producto por FDA en junio y empezando a vender fin de julio. Ya vendía algo en Europa . Próximos ER deberían ser explosivos.
2641 2018-09-08 10:37:51 While stocks last 
2642 2018-09-08 10:37:43 Además de por técnico por fundamentales , cuando se fue abajo en los 5$ fue por la ampliación de capital , ya una vez hecha entraron muchísimos institucionales en la ampliación a 4,11$. De ahí no la dejarán bajar . PT de analistas 6$. La veo a fin de año mínimo ahí.
2643 2018-09-08 10:37:24 The same way that all of a sudden you earn 10.000 just by owning stocks.
2644 2018-09-08 10:36:01 Apparently @Nike is CRAZY for supporting that racist, cop hating, anti-American Kaepernick. Get ready for your stocks to plummet. Heres what Nike's future will look like soon.

2649 2018-09-08 10:28:23 Just saying that any collections of stocks and bonds that are not properly diversified runs the risk of complete failure with zero fail safes. He should know this.
2650 2018-09-08 10:25:39 $BABA the stock shows topping with 165neckline broadening top measures to 120.  If BABA is going down which other stocks are going down? Why
2651 2018-09-08 10:23:59 Before World War 1, I document that, on average, 80% of all shares listed on the Brussels Stock Exchange do worse than the risk-free rate. Nevertheless, the equity premium was positive. So even then, returns on individual stocks were very skewed. Stock picking was very difficult.
2652 2018-09-08 10:23:56 Stocks will drop because rich republicans will sell stock. Ordinary folk don’t care about that. Nike worldwide sales soaring because,barring some white racist Americans, the world hates Trump. The worst US president of all time and mentally unfit for office

2656 2018-09-08 10:20:20 Historians also know that five firms(Exxon Mobile, Apple, IBM, GE and Microsoft) accounted for 10% of the totalwealth creation in the US. 

On a yearly basis, 51,6% of all stocks do better than the risk-free rate and 44,4% do better than the index. 

Returns were always skewed.
2657 2018-09-08 10:18:43 I find this very hard to believe. Stocks tanked for a reason.

2689 2018-09-08 09:44:09 #Tesla stocks going down because of Elon Musk smoking on Joe Rogan's podcast makes the same sense as going up never reporting profits (or never paying dividends -I'm looking at you #Google and the other 99%-)
2690 2018-09-08 09:42:30 Sentient, based in San Francisco, used artificial intelligence techniques, including machine learning and so-called evolutionary algorithms, to trade stocks globally. It followed a market-neutral strategy in which bets on rising prices were matched by wagers on falling ones.
2691 2018-09-08 09:42:12 They will go up baby. He is just being human. We need leaders who can show their side of humanity and are able to have fun on their expense. How about stocks attached to Joe Rogan they must have sky rocketed after this.

2697 2018-09-08 09:30:45 Companies are using their tax cuts to buy back their own stocks. This boosts the stock markets at the cost of worker salaries and r&d. Long term, it’s a disaster, and short term it increases inequality.

2702 2018-09-08 09:19:46 He talked about privatizing. I'm suggesting a half way solution where private equity helps de-list, but digitizing the stocks allows for a market place to exist without the need for continuous disclosure + benefit of being global. There's several options and lots to work through.

2722 2018-09-08 08:57:36 Why not want to go to space?  Hasn't everyone at one point or another?  Isn't that his choice?  It's his money.  I  receive a fair wage.  I actually make right around $15/hr.  Full benefits.  Stocks.  Monthly bonuses.  PTO.  Retirement plan.  Promotion/Education opportunities.
2723 2018-09-08 08:57:06 Uk should ban scallop fishing until the correct season to protect the stocks and use less destructive methods.

For all @theresa_may talk of protecting the environment and wildlife she ignores this as she recognises she already shafted the fishermen
2724 2018-09-08 08:54:16 2/ Banks don't loan money to 15 year old kids to buy stocks and shares. He's a complete liar, Walter Mitty bullshit merchant. He LIED to a bank, or he's lying and the incident never occured. Whichever way, he's a crook.
2725 2018-09-08 08:53:39 Tesla bulls are in complete denial. Not only will their stocks become worthless, their cars will as well. Keep an eye on a growing flogging 2nd hand market. $tsla $tslaq

2735 2018-09-08 08:40:19 Yo why are @Tesla stocks dropping because #ElonMusk smoked weed pubically? You know he does it at home too. If anything weed should be legalized everywhere simultaneously
2736 2018-09-08 08:40:09 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
2737 2018-09-08 08:39:56 Musk went high ,stocks went low.
2738 2018-09-08 08:38:22 If he wants to go-private he needs to smoke far more weed and have a few more Exec's resign. I don't expect it to dump much deeper.. strong support around 252. If I traded stocks i'd be long, with a tight stop at 245. #MandatoryReselection for those who call us dogs

2740 2018-09-08 08:37:23 Stock market is a horrible indicator for your own personal wealthy. How much do you have in your 401k right now? Also, wanna know the only reason the stocks are booking? Trump haters spend money on companies who denounce Trump HEAVILY over those who love him, who spend pro-trump.
2741 2018-09-08 08:37:04 He's one of the most innovative minds of our time.  Many great thinkers attribute recreational drug use as a necessity for their ingenuity. No one should be suprised by him smoking some up. However, marijuana stocks have grown on average 46% in a month. Investors be hating!

2743 2018-09-08 08:33:58 Have to factor in mkt cyclicality and EM-DM risk premium.

2756 2018-09-08 08:09:05 Easy solution. Change structure of ERs and general hospitals to non profit.

2762 2018-09-08 08:03:41 I understand there is a principled agreement in the past to respect a no fishing period to rejuvenate stocks for the benefit of both-why should the British boats not respect it now?Legal right maybe but it’s not cricket you might say!

2777 2018-09-08 07:49:16 You should add the date to the sentence that your Tesla stocks are worth a lot of money because that sentence is getting outdated quickly. Is ten percent of a lot still a lot?
2778 2018-09-08 07:48:37 @elonmusk thank you for being a human. I hope all who sold stocks kick them selves in a few months. When I’m able to afford some Tesla shares I’ll happily purchase them win or lose. It’s about bettering our future not quick money. Don’t diverge from your path.
2779 2018-09-08 07:48:30 That is incredibly stupid. Neither are erectile dysfunction meds,bump stocks, AR 15’s, etc. @LindseyGrahamSC should get out of the senate.

2791 2018-09-08 07:35:37 He oversaw the biggest wealth transfer in from the poor to the rich in history. He kept rates at historic lows. Banks then lent that cheap money to cops who used it to buy back their own stocks. A pump and dump that was previously illegal till Regan legalized btw.

2793 2018-09-08 07:31:52 A booming economy for the people who own stocks is super cool. Btw the liberal elite are right up there racking in potential cash. How you all doing in places w/ no jobs, or low paying jobs or no option of buying stocks. Or no option to buy a house?

2795 2018-09-08 07:30:05 It’s brutal enough finding the right stocks, then figuring all of the price, timing, premium stuff out makes it that much harder. Seems to me, selling options would make more sense than buying them, from a distance anyhow.

2804 2018-09-08 07:19:14 The most important part about having more stocks is allowing yourself more time to adapt and giving you the opportunity to build a lead.

As many people say, I think crypto market has just started
 because of market scale and development of laws. And

2828 2018-09-08 06:54:54 Stop with polls.  Learn your lesson. His support is high among those that elected him. Look what’s happened to ISIS. You have to pay taxes to get tax cuts.  You have to have stocks to benefit from record stocks.  I received $8k annually in taxes and an 18% return on stocks.

2833 2018-09-08 06:51:57 Whatever stocks that Elon Musk is associated with went down today after the Joe Rogan interview, I'd buy.  Reactionary panic from an old school group that doesn't know how to deal with the new culture.  They still have the money, but can't figure out where it's going.

2840 2018-09-08 06:40:04 You people are clowns Lol! The Obama admin couldnt even make a working website. Trumps here economy stocks jobs at record highs and you think the world is ending. Obama did nothing for you.
2841 2018-09-08 06:39:53 you had a mortgage on your building and had to pay for paint booths, lifts, trucks for tows, etc... For 30 years, you only get back what you’ve invested there abouts. We don’t have 401ks. We don’t have stocks. We only have Real Estate. So, who wins in the end? Not us!
2842 2018-09-08 06:38:05 Also go look at all Nike international stocks... down a lot!!
2843 2018-09-08 06:38:00 We get paid a FAIR WAGE for the job we do.  It is not based on the size of the individual's family or the debt we may have incurred.  It is based, on the job, for all doing that.  FT also gets bi-annual raises, monthly bonuses, Co stocks, full benefits.  Want more $?  Promote.
2844 2018-09-08 06:36:25 And there are so many opportunities within the FC to do just that.
Did you know that FT assoicates also recieve co stocks, monthly incentive bonuses, full medical benefits, OT&promotion opportunities.  There is no reason one has to remain entry level, unless they choose to.
2845 2018-09-08 06:36:07 I have maintained for over 2 years now to close traders, if $BABA gets audited it will show a fraud. #JackMa is nothing but a chosen actor that has loaned $Billions from U.S banks against his stocks that he will never show for as he will reside strictly in China.
2846 2018-09-08 06:35:35 If stocks wouldn’t be so dramatically overvalued, I‘d love to buy some right now.
2847 2018-09-08 06:33:43 @shyamsek is talking about micro cap funds not individual stocks I believe
2848 2018-09-08 06:33:34 Following the ganja fuelled interview, Tesla stocks took another massive hit. Independent of that the CFO also resigned. I’m not sure Mr  Musk is quite on top mental form of late. I’m wondering if he’s deliberately devaluing stock  in order to privatise Tesla on the cheap later.
2849 2018-09-08 06:31:57 @BoredElonMusk listen, going down on the stock market is like loosing your fake friends. You are genius like Mr.Einstein you will be remember or ever!!!who cares going down 6%. I look at the bright side, now i start saving to buy your stocks. The world Loves you.

2852 2018-09-08 06:26:47 The economy was thriving.   Obama dug is out of the biggest recession in history. Trump poured gas on a healthy fire by giving corporations their biggest tax cuts AND began dismantling regulations! That’s what got the corporations to buy back stocks confident of huge profits.
2853 2018-09-08 06:26:34 On a macro perspective: stocks nearing their tops. Crypto’s nearing their lows. When flippening ?
2854 2018-09-08 06:25:17 #farmbill Not sure about the pork, yet. I don’t think it’s been released. But, it sounds like once again, the 1% made out like bandits. A decrease in tax on stocks they hold. SNAP PROGRAM, was reduced and some people will make too much money to get. I’m disappointed.
2855 2018-09-08 06:24:09 There is no more slogan stocks. Pls wait for GO notice as I will re-print them again.

2859 2018-09-08 06:17:56 Most of older stocks sit there quietly. The high flying stocks are rather newcomers. Meaning when they were ipo index went up perfunctorily. Currntly U aint see the part where greed set the motion. Look at GE a nat. Security-laden stock. U think they ll let tht sucker went down?
2860 2018-09-08 06:13:43 apple stocks rise by 35%.
2861 2018-09-08 06:10:53 Do you want government limiting how many stocks you can buy when they're cheap? No, that cheats the market. Same with this, it would take away my right to buy when and how many I want, essentially taxing me by making me buy at higher prices. Get it now?

2870 2018-09-08 06:03:35 Prices of stocks had gone down. I think that this scenario is always the best time to invest on stock market. But, as always, we should keep in mind to invest only our extra money because price of stocks is volatile.

2886 2018-09-08 05:51:06 In March 2008 a client’s stock account was down 40% to $250K. Obama is POTUS for 2 mo. He told me “sell it all and move to cash until that Muslim is out of office“. I begged him not to but to no avail. 8 yrs later he had $250k cash. Stocks would’ve been $750k. Racists are stupid.

2904 2018-09-08 05:24:48 Pay really close attention, Trump is sharp as a tack.  There are clues everywhere Q on new stocks to pick.  Re-evaluate, get out of anything global, look at new renamed companies, look at gold and silver.  Trump’s got your back.  “Build the Wall” meant way more.
2905 2018-09-08 05:24:20 Elon Musk's stocks going down due to his interview is bogus to me.
2906 2018-09-08 05:23:19 Elon Musk smoke weed and drink whiskey on a podcast so that his stocks would plummet and he could privatize his company again
2907 2018-09-08 05:21:55 We traders and active investors are largely misperceived breed. Our profession/discipline is also misunderstood. Trading whether that of Forex, Futures, Stocks, Bonds or Options, is usually viewed as gambling by the public. It's seen as a way to get rich quick through luck but

2915 2018-09-08 05:16:28 As a benchmark analyst, I've been bearish for the US stock market as a whole for weeks. As the largest cap in the S&P an APPLE downturn requires special attention. Especially because much of the gains were seeing is outperformance from the FAANG stocks.
2916 2018-09-08 05:13:15 @Shell_India @PetroleumMin @dpradhanbjp sir across Bengaluru shell petrol stations they r not keeping Normal petrol stocks and forcing public to go for Power petrol, sometimes stocks r available they r mentioning some machine problems n forcing us for power petrol which is costly

2922 2018-09-08 05:09:29 I do remember when the recovery started.  It was literally on the day Donald Trump was elected. Look back at headlines on that day and you'll see.  And, apart from the two glitches brought on by lies in the press, stocks and shares never stopped going up since.

2929 2018-09-08 05:00:48 Soros just bought stocks in Twitter/FB  but since his Davos statement of tighter censorship on social media & Trudeau comes back and threatens FB.. they are hanging themselves. The tighter the grip, the more humans natural urge to fight their way out. Lets hope its in time!
2930 2018-09-08 05:00:27 Shyam, doesn't the same apply to your stocks as well? Most of your holdings are down 40-50% if not more. But your stake in them is still intact or only gone up. Maybe no one took you seriously because you don't practice what you preach.
2931 2018-09-08 04:59:56 September has indeed been one of the more historically bad months for stocks but at the same time, this provides a good opportunities to load up on some of your favorite picks at a lower price.
2932 2018-09-08 04:59:36 i am not white enough to actually care about stocks but i think they've been going down in a steady fashion
2933 2018-09-08 04:59:08 By him doing that the stocks went down. And Nike burning the sneakers.
2934 2018-09-08 04:59:03 Then why did their stocks tank ?
2935 2018-09-08 04:58:26 Oversold stocks $FB, $ASML and $MU. Many DOW stocks still looking strong.
2936 2018-09-08 04:57:25 $TSLA stocks down 9%... I guess smoking live on camera still spooks some people out.
2937 2018-09-08 04:56:18 The world’s wheat stocks will deplete in 17 days.

2939 2018-09-08 04:56:05 This is how #FoxNews does it. #Nike stocks tanked (they didn't). They might have had an increase in sales (31%). 
2940 2018-09-08 04:55:26 i mean yeah the guy has a few screws loose but its just so weird to me that after all the shit hes said and done, it was smoking weed that made his stocks drop
2941 2018-09-08 04:54:55 If Elon musk smoking during that podcast made Tesla’s stocks price drop society really needs to wake up.... and by the way it’s called a “BLUNT” not a joint fools!
2942 2018-09-08 04:53:52 Everybody will gonna forget bout it,s stocks will go back up, Tesla is the new way of the road
2943 2018-09-08 04:53:40 Most people just about have enough for food and shelter. They can hardly spend that on stocks instead.

2947 2018-09-08 04:49:35 Prices are on the rise while wages are not rising. The big companies took the tax breaks to buy stocks in their own companies, so the trickle down bull was never going to happen. I don't understand the trouble he's causing with our allies while sucking up 2 hostile gov't...
2948 2018-09-08 04:48:41 1. 1.Everybody who sold their stocks from @Tesla Becuase the legend himself @elonmusk took a small puff from a joint !LEGALLY! is such an ignorant sh*t.

2949 2018-09-08 04:48:31 i dont like elon musk but why tf is he getting shit for smoking weed during an interview?

the dude interviewing him was the one who offered him a hit, and it was pretty obvious he doesnt smoke regularly

would stocks drop if the dude took a shot of vodka?? who fuckin cares dude
2950 2018-09-08 04:47:24 If you pulled your stocks in #Tesla because #ElonMusk smoked a #blunt...

2958 2018-09-08 04:34:03 He should have stuck it out. He'll sell out the stock at little to no profit. And Nike stocks have rebounded. Sales will follow. Must have followed the Trump business model.
2959 2018-09-08 04:33:12 @AnalysisSense  HOW TO SCREEN/SCAN STOCKS....
2960 2018-09-08 04:32:42 Nike stocks were at 80.73 August 10th. Nearly where it is as of now. Nothing lost in a month.  Free  publicity. The idiots that burned Nike shoes are the same ones that burned Kenton jerseys. Idiots.
2961 2018-09-08 04:32:03 Guys when will you refill the stocks you guys have refilled the stocks of wireless bullets in America its time for india too.

2963 2018-09-08 04:31:08 Paper stocks- I can't recommend names given that's not my professional job. As an investor my preferences are known and spoken about inc on twitter
2964 2018-09-08 04:30:25 so kaep doesn’t vote to try and help change, and says hillary should be in jail and we should applaud his genius. time will tell if nike’s bet will pay off. not 5 days of stocks bud
2965 2018-09-08 04:30:10 The economy is on the same track it already was, stocks and GDP as well. A VAST majority of the taxcuts went to the already wealthy who are NOT spending it on wages or infrastructure, only increasing the debt. His tradewars are already hurting us.
2966 2018-09-08 04:28:39 Remember Tesla stocks dropped because some executive left, or whatever he was. Not because of the blunt lol #mediaistrash
2967 2018-09-08 04:28:15 The whole Elon Musl thing is dumb! I agree buy the stocks

Else it will be more money chasing the same old stocks giving unrealistic valuations, the kind we are seeing in the consumption sector.
MF industry can grow only if valuations remain realistic
2977 2018-09-08 04:15:06 Yo Elon musk smoking made Tesla stocks drop 
2978 2018-09-08 04:12:44 @MFIndustryFocus can you please share the list of potential dividend yield trap stocks and the checklist for yield traps mentioned in the podcast? Thx!
2979 2018-09-08 04:08:53 Market returns dont work in linear way. so, one should never invest any sum which he would need in the next 1-2 or even 5 yrs in equities.

2981 2018-09-08 04:07:05 Sir last year soril holdings hit 27 upper circuits In a row and just 1 lower circuit after that..It's not necessary that stocks which hit continuous upper circuits will hot continuous lower circuits. Fundamental change has happen in the company.
2982 2018-09-08 04:06:44 The last leg of this bull market in the stock market was absolutely due to tax breaks (we'll pay for that later). But we were already in a multi-year earnings rally prior to the election. There was a pause before the vote. Then a rotation into Trump friendly stocks.
2983 2018-09-08 04:06:44 I don't buy Nike because of their inhumane labor practices. I could care less if their stocks are going through the roof. 

I still stand with #TakeAKnee though.
2984 2018-09-08 04:06:41 CNBC doesn’t care about journalistic integrity. They throw Jim Cramer out there every night to pump stocks so his buddies can unload paper on retail.

2988 2018-09-08 04:03:45 Sounds like those stocks will be electrifying
2989 2018-09-08 04:03:14 If ACB goes before APH then we can confirm that Robinhood is the uplist hint for stocks already off DTC chill, and Interactive brokers is the hint for non DTC names (TRST, HEXO)
2990 2018-09-08 04:03:06 The stock market is a reflection not on the well being of a country but on the well being of corporations. The ups and downs in stocks affect mainly a very small % of people. A president’s actions affect us all. trump is a wretch.
2991 2018-09-08 04:02:30 Obama u said Trump would drop the market it would collapse and how could he fix it... what with a MAGIC WAND. . .?  Media stories effect the stocks . . its been 2 years.. its not u @POTUS44 ; Ur only here to help the DNC in their failure...

2996 2018-09-08 03:57:59 However not all tech stocks survived so I think we have to find those that we think have the best chance and diversify because too many unknowns.
2997 2018-09-08 03:56:05 Tesla dude is worth over $20 billion. Media game of talking about stocks dropping with Nike/NFL and other billion dollar companies is corny. Stocks rise and fall. Billionaires can withstand all of it!
2998 2018-09-08 03:55:53 Ya any stock the size of Tesla that has no means in being a long term investment option is bound to do this; the other stocks with similar value are all long term stocks Tesla is wild i was an investor @ $120 sold at 240

3001 2018-09-08 03:51:00 Are you on drugs. Stocks were at 8000 January 2009. 19000 January 2017. Unemployment was 9.5% 2009. 4.6% January 2017. Trump is just riding the recovery for now until his trade war hurts USA.
3002 2018-09-08 03:50:07 Yall quick advice

BUY NIKE STOCKS!!
3003 2018-09-08 03:47:43 Stocks have started rising and Nike orders have soared 27% after ad debut!!  I would say Nike was thinking SUCCESS in truth!!
3004 2018-09-08 03:46:57 So that explains why their stocks are up????? Geeze most businesses should make that mistake 
3005 2018-09-08 03:45:02 I’m bout to force stocks on all my brothers
3006 2018-09-08 03:44:34 Agree. Personally still struggling . Find myself selling my long term holds on bad news and re buying the same stocks later.
3007 2018-09-08 03:42:56 Let’s buy Nike stocks as well.
3008 2018-09-08 03:42:35 I suggest Aramaic. But what do I know...I choose my stocks using a dart & dart board.
3009 2018-09-08 03:42:34 Stocks dropped. Sales will have a temporary increase. It will level out. Other sportswear companies will start to see increase, thus taking part of their market share.

3019 2018-09-08 03:36:27 Yeah .

I literally was miles ahead both stocks and boom. 
3020 2018-09-08 03:33:45 you should be able to see it within a second of looking at the chart.  I used to scan nightly but now Its almost by osmosis that I create my watch lists.   Find a few dozen good stocks and just wait until they setup.
3021 2018-09-08 03:33:37 In my first tweet I said  .12% is no big deal. I'm not here to put down Nike I'm just providing facts, you are the one making personal. Nobodies stocks just go up. Most stocks look like Nike. Like I said twice before "no big deal " sorry it is for you
3022 2018-09-08 03:32:10 ?? trump didn't say anything about niki's stocks being up or down.
3023 2018-09-08 03:31:35 I stock up down south or after the beer fest here in October. So my stocks are currently low.
3024 2018-09-08 03:31:02 I saw the stocks took a decent hit all because he decided to use a legal drug that wasn't alcohol  lol

3026 2018-09-08 03:28:37 For defining the trend.... Do you consider conditions like stocks which are up 20%+ or 30% or X% in last month or last 3 months etc?

3028 2018-09-08 03:26:15 Tell that to all of former Wall Street who thought "what is" is all it's about. Wall Street can kill or go broke from making right or wrong decisions on stocks.
3029 2018-09-08 03:26:14 And do you see that the stocks were up all day? Do you see that .12% is nothing?
Losing day over day is one thing. A momentary drop is nothing. Just the normal fluctuations of the market. Again, you dont seem to understand these things.
3030 2018-09-08 03:25:52 tesla stocks really dropped over elongated muskrat smoking a blunt meanwhile he didnt even inhale
3031 2018-09-08 03:23:52 Yep...that's what I said...and you clearly don't...unless Procter & Gamble, Walmart, Apple and 100s of other stocks were also down this week because of @Nike's ad campaign.   But I'll give you a participation trophy if it makes you feel better.  
3032 2018-09-08 03:23:41 Side note let’s look at $ua they had such a competitive advantage clothing and men’s boxer briefs now it’s all shit. Clothing is like plastic and since they manufacture in different regions same sizes are different no wonder stocks in the toilet on the 5 yr.
3033 2018-09-08 03:22:20 U do know Tesla stocks went down today cuz of this yea?
3034 2018-09-08 03:22:13 You do understand that the value of the stocks are based on the value of the company which is based on the profits they make which is based on the sales they made? Right?
3035 2018-09-08 03:20:41 My younger “brother” is seriously lecturing me about stocks right now and I’m so over him. And my patience is so thin. OMG.

3038 2018-09-08 03:17:42 All I can say is keep monitoring the prices of chemicals it manufacturers. The day the prices of its chemicals start falling drastically it will be wise to book else it can be held. I believe whichever chemical stocks we buy we need to track their product prices online.
3039 2018-09-08 03:17:20 Probably the traders that remember 2000 and 2008..   You guys are just as clueless as you were back then..  Just buy stocks forever, because they never go down.  And never ever talk about debt..
3040 2018-09-08 03:16:26 Trump tried to make their stocks drop with that latest tweet. Racist.
3041 2018-09-08 03:16:10 America isn’t thriving. Emerging stocks are entering a bear market. Trump entered office during a 100+ month bull market. Trump’s team is being indicted and convicted. That’s the definition of corruption.  Cite your claims, please.
3042 2018-09-08 03:15:45 Whats the update on this??  purchased 500 $TSLA stocks at 360 $ soon after your tweet.. hoping you will repurchase at 420..

3062 2018-09-08 03:01:56 It's not wise to chase stocks which hit uc daily. Let them fly and search for new opportunities. Search for new small cap business ideas.

3072 2018-09-08 02:58:42 You do realize that your 401k is up because of employer match, right?

Stocks are up about 20-25% since election day.
3073 2018-09-08 02:58:06 Smooth sailing. Strong economy. Strong dollar. Issue like never before. Inflation prob stays low. It's solid, stocks can't go down, right? Might as well buy lots of duration just in case
3074 2018-09-08 02:56:48 Of course stocks go up and down. Just no coincidence they went down the day after their big new marketing campaign was announced. #TwitterKnowItAll
3075 2018-09-08 02:56:20 So Is there anyway to buy these kind of stocks ?
3076 2018-09-08 02:55:19 @jamieliu @horry25 why risk all that money? Send 20% of that buying Jan 2019 calls to strike just $12. Better than playing stocks.

3078 2018-09-08 02:54:55 up, 31%..... and stocks down.... lol.
3079 2018-09-08 02:54:32 Tesla’s stocks have plummeted
3080 2018-09-08 02:53:48 Yeah I assumed she meant sales cause I knew that was a ridiculous number for stocks. I did look it up she did in fact mean sales and more specifically online sales were up 31% from Sunday-Tuesday.
3081 2018-09-08 02:53:32 Obama was the real enemy of the country. Every time he opened his mouth my stocks took another hit. Now it is steadily gaining every quarter.
3082 2018-09-08 02:53:00 And stocks down.  Only company in the whole country down.. except maybe starbucks, lol.
3083 2018-09-08 02:52:56 Final Destination only

3084 2018-09-08 02:52:35 Universal Starch was available for 2 days when I posted it in Bullbull group. Since then it isn't available. Same with kanchi it was available for a few days only. This is the prob with illiquid stocks.
3085 2018-09-08 02:51:27 Which is also why the stock market rose so high. Low interest rates killed the bond market. Real estate was still in shock. The only place to put money was in stocks.
3086 2018-09-08 02:50:28 #JustDoIt their Internet sales from Sunday to Wednesday is UP 31% and stocks are same as always. Most took the time to educate themselves on the meaning and the cause thus most support it! Thanks to Colin for making all aware and doing something to help!

3088 2018-09-08 02:47:58 One of the things I dislike most about Apple app design: View Stocks “Today” widget.
“Hey, TSLA recovered a bit.”
5 seconds later the table refreshes.
“oh…”
Until/unless you watch the data refresh, you can’t know if the data is current or days old. Many of their apps do this.
3089 2018-09-08 02:46:32 Use the old style stocks, and throw rotten tomatoes at them. For that matter, any spoiled waste will do. Especially swamp shit.
3090 2018-09-08 02:45:59 Stocks are up 31%
3091 2018-09-08 02:45:29 That’s outstanding, what has this Kapernick done that’s positive for football, nothing. All he’s succeeded is dividing the real athlete. Nike stocks have been dropping like a rock and rightfully so.
3092 2018-09-08 02:45:26 Hiw is your stocks and retirement doing? I bet you like him now
3093 2018-09-08 02:45:20 people are making too much of a fuzz over Elon Musk weed taste ! His stocks fell too. smh
3094 2018-09-08 02:42:52 How to buy these stocks which daily touches upper circuit ?
3095 2018-09-08 02:42:18 Kindly suggest yet to blast stocks
3096 2018-09-08 02:42:17 Actually they are getting tons of free advertising, their sales are up, it’s Yuge! And their stocks are doing well. So exactly how is this a bad marketing move, forgetting the fact that they are supporting basic American values, while doing it.
3097 2018-09-08 02:42:03 Forget indices being “propped up by 5 stocks” if market breadth is so terrible you should easily be able to run a net short book & get returns. All you see is crying tho.

3101 2018-09-08 02:39:55 If you’re ok with clunky shoes I have friends who swear by Algeria. They’re pricey but are orthopedic. I really want a pair but can’t seem to find a store near me that stocks them (trying to exchange stuff online from CA>US sucks ).
3102 2018-09-08 02:39:08 Stocks are derivatives of companies and companies are derivatives of people. there will always be a few bad apples however largely people are honest and want to progress and succeed. Find these enterprising and smart people and invest in their companies.
3103 2018-09-08 02:38:05 Many billions more have been spent on oil. The fact is technology is increasing at an ever faster rate. To think it will stop at the lithium battery is pretty short term thinking. No doubt Li batteries will play a massive role in the coming years though.
3104 2018-09-08 02:37:59 The gun show loophole, and private gun sales are basically regulation-free. And we need commonsense federal regulation of large-capacity magazines, bump stocks and assault weapons.

3110 2018-09-08 02:33:03 There are thousands of stratospheric stocks. It’s the biggest, longest bible in history. You will never see anything like it ever again. So many tech and biotech that have been going to the sky for 10yrs like adbe, adsk, amzn, jazz, aapl, nflx, Burlington coat,five below etc
3111 2018-09-08 02:32:41 I’m just stating truths, like we have record stocks, record minority and women employment, record median wages, a pacified NK, hostages returned, better trade, 4.2 GDP and more. Which of these are bad things?
3112 2018-09-08 02:31:43 Always trade strength and fade or exit weakness.Stronger the stocks ,more favored it is with fund houses.Weaker ones are obviously out of favour .Simply because ,when market rises ,strong ones rises more and when market fall ,weaker ones fall more.

3122 2018-09-08 02:21:40 I’m about to start to buy stocks in companies he bashes.
3123 2018-09-08 02:21:36 Foregoing the honeymoon and asking my husband to buy me a car and stocks in international companies.
3124 2018-09-08 02:19:38 Good time to by stocks in Tesla, though. Otherwise, I have nothing but respect for ol' Musky.
3125 2018-09-08 02:17:30 On vacation in Hawaii so maybe I missed something but did Kazakhs say something at the Nuclear conference to spook people? Spot holding, I can’t quite understand the hit to the stocks. From what I read they spoke constructively.@quakes99 @BrentBrickman @cannonball1246 @SNS5500
3126 2018-09-08 02:17:26 Florida billionaire was scamming people by pumping up worthless biotech stocks and then dumping them.
3127 2018-09-08 02:16:32 Investing isn’t about core beliefs. It’s about buying low and selling higher. Don’t buy stocks your excited about. Buy stocks everyone else is excited about.
3128 2018-09-08 02:16:07 7 stocks na lang huhuhu kailangan ko na talaga bumili 
3129 2018-09-08 02:15:53 Doing a bit of reflecting this evening on the entire year this bear market. One glance at the daily chart and you can see the blatant pump and dumps of bitcoin over & over & over & they don’t even try to disguise it due to how immature this space is. Reminds me of penny stocks.
3130 2018-09-08 02:15:29 If the economy keeps rolling and unemployment stays low, stocks stay up,...no.
3131 2018-09-08 02:14:26 Like you sell stocks.
3132 2018-09-08 02:14:02 #Tesla Stocks falling after #ElonMusk goes on #joeroganexperience is sad. He’s just a normal person like the rest of us, granted he might be slightly smarter 
3133 2018-09-08 02:13:43 As I said. Stocks change fast so Obama's economy was left 15 months ago.
3134 2018-09-08 02:13:06 I follow some dude on Instagram who jerks off to stocks and he seriously was like “oh no gotta sell Tesla Elon musk smoked weed..”
3135 2018-09-08 02:12:58 Why would Nike, Levi’s, and others do stuff to tank their stocks...tank the stock market to make Trump look bad before midterms?
3136 2018-09-08 02:12:33 What mistake? 140 3 million in free advertising? Stocks  unchanged -you’re not so naïve that you think those little ups and downs are not normal right? Not only that the NFL is in contract to use them till 2028 bitch! So Pay or stay makes no difference to them
3137 2018-09-08 02:11:47 @Watchman18 @DeviantLittleBastard @SizeMatters with the money I made on oil stocks I could buy the whole burger joint
3138 2018-09-08 02:10:56 Screw Hillary. That's her pharma stocks talking
3139 2018-09-08 02:09:38 Just buy weed stocks now
3140 2018-09-08 02:07:05 What about their stocks dropping like 4 billion? I see you are not mentioning that....
3141 2018-09-08 02:05:21 It's kind of pathetic that in this day and age if a business person smokes a cigarette or a cigar, nobody bats an eye, but if they smoke a joint that's by far FAR less harmful, their stocks plummet... There is something drastically wrong with social norms of society...
3142 2018-09-08 02:05:00 Number of leading stocks today: 67 $SPY $QQQ $FB $GOOG $AMZN $GOOG $AAPL #DailyStkLeaderCount
3143 2018-09-08 02:04:56 like I get why people dont like their commercial, but there's gotta be a better way to make an impact. their stocks already plummeted.
3144 2018-09-08 02:03:52 2-along with Fannie and Freddie, extorted Home lenders to give loans to people who couldn’t afford them. Threatening civil rights suits if they didn’t. Then Fannie and Freddie kept assuring the banks that everything was fine, that investing in these loans as bundled stocks-
3145 2018-09-08 02:03:31 How does one trade this system ? I am new to stocks so wanted to know this.
3146 2018-09-08 02:03:15 and BTW, ALL my money is in Canadian pot stocks and I'm making a killing
3147 2018-09-08 02:03:02 US GDP growth despite @realDonaldTrump rants is only HALF that of China - analysts predict a 40% crash in US stocks due to a hangover from the last GFC, QE and low interest rates. Don’t let Trump fool you, the economy is on thin ice and he is out of control!
3148 2018-09-08 02:02:46 #tesla @CNNMoney easier to go private if stocks are low cost less to buy it out.
3149 2018-09-08 02:02:42 pledis produced 3x of the stocks for yjh items... tbh 
3150 2018-09-08 02:02:35 Funny how all the Liberals come out.  Look at the stocks.  31%?  nothing.  Nike will sell and sell and it will be done.  Stocks will still tumble by day due to wall street big investors.  Have a good day.  Know how your country works before you say something.
3151 2018-09-08 02:02:16 I don’t have anything flashy to flex but I got these stocks & crypto though 
3152 2018-09-08 02:01:26 Ok and trump supporters were  saying stocks fell. That was all temporary.
3153 2018-09-08 02:00:25 Elon Musk goes on Joe Rogan and doesn't inhale weed. Tesla stocks plummet, news hosts describe Rogan as a meathead, a druggie, and declare Musk a liability to the company he founded. 

That's what happens when dumb shareholders and TV ppl jealous of Rogan's popularity collide.
3154 2018-09-08 01:59:54 Well.  Looking at stocks and sales.  I’d say MAKING NIKE GREAT AGAIN!!   Sorry Donnie.  I know you are a narcissist but you don’t control the world.  You just think you do #badfaketan
3155 2018-09-08 01:59:17 You left out the part about tanking stocks while smoking your two joints
3156 2018-09-08 01:58:13 Oh wait I didn’t fuck up (I’m brand new to this) but what I’m trying to say is if it was normal, people wouldn’t be resigning from Tesla and its stocks wouldn’t be dropping. Stock holders consider this behavior abnormal. Does that make sense?
3157 2018-09-08 01:57:55 Thank You!  Now it's time to sink my teeth into some Industrial stocks.
3158 2018-09-08 01:57:38 Not all bad. Teleprompter stocks went up....
3159 2018-09-08 01:56:11 Elon Musk smoking weed made all the investors pull their stocks pennies to the dollar, making it easier for Elon to privatize the stock for much cheaper in the future  smart man
3160 2018-09-08 01:55:53 Played the game of Greed today. Reminded me of stocks #Math530
3161 2018-09-08 01:54:35 You are full of s... as fake news! Get out of your cozy office and go ask hard working middle class America what they think ! For you it may start in 2009 when your stocks bounce back but for rest of us !we had to wait for somebody like @realDonaldTrump ...
3162 2018-09-08 01:54:33 Yay!!! I can now avail, sell, and trade stocks with my BDO Nomura!!!
3163 2018-09-08 01:53:56 Tesla's stocks dropped ~9% and a main exec quit ...
3164 2018-09-08 01:53:46 I really appreciate my principal,I asked if he could explain stocks in depth and he took his whole hour and a half period to explain it to me and I couldn’t be more thankful
3165 2018-09-08 01:52:22 Seems like the "lost decades" we lament are really just for big and expensive stocks
3166 2018-09-08 01:52:09 At least as far as stocks go*
3167 2018-09-08 01:50:52 Well my comment was on a tweet saying to look at the stocks, nothing about Kap, so that's when I said they were still higher than a year ago, and also, it wasn't even to you. See how I commented on that other person? That means I was addressing that tweet.
3168 2018-09-08 01:50:25 SBS's with full stocks are the best SBS's.
3169 2018-09-08 01:50:05 One problem with MFs is that they cannot simply hold five stocks and charge fees for it, IMO.
3170 2018-09-08 01:46:33 They can be measured by improvements in relative wage...And better to attempt to correct than have them be deeply exacerbated, as Trump and co seem intent on doing. Tax cuts for corps and the rich don't work bc that money is more likely to go to stocks, not employees.
3171 2018-09-08 01:46:21 I'm probably the millionth person to suggest this, but invest in penny stocks to improve your autism
3172 2018-09-08 01:45:49 We just have more working people on public assistance because the companies that benefited the most from tax cuts used the money to buy back stocks rather than pay Americans a decent wage.
3173 2018-09-08 01:45:35 nike stocks went up today, heard the kneelers bought a lot of shares and that's the reason. Boycott nike patriots and watch them lose their investment. Patriots stand
3174 2018-09-08 01:45:17 @Tesla stocks go down because @elonmusk smokes pot on air? Really? I'm sorry but this is so stupid. Who cares. He's brilliant and is going to change our world, lliterally.

Killed ACA now medical costs through the roof! Largest debt ever with only means to pay back is gut Social Security & Medicare! We’re screwed
3178 2018-09-08 01:43:44 apple stocks rise by 10%.
3179 2018-09-08 01:43:20 How many people, through exposure to crypto, have learned about forex, stocks, etc and wanted to take a position in those markets, but don’t have anyway to Segway into them?

3180 2018-09-08 01:42:47 Flat stocks you never performed @realDonaldTrump @SFGOP
3181 2018-09-08 01:41:48 I sold 90% of my pot Stocks a couple days ago when Tilray hit 90, it looks like it just printed an evening star, you know what that means....
3182 2018-09-08 01:40:15 Can you break down some more stocks for us G ?
3183 2018-09-08 01:39:33 In 2020, #TaxScam breaks disappear for the middle- and working-classes, but don't disappear for corporations. 
Guess who's going to get stuck with that $1.5 TRILLION deficit created so Swampmonster corporations could buyback stocks?
3184 2018-09-08 01:38:54 Why don't you actually look up the stocks for Nike and see what I'm talking about?? Do a little research for yourself.
3185 2018-09-08 01:38:53 How are points 3 and  4 relevant to the attendance?
3186 2018-09-08 01:38:29 I agree with the ove arching idea... however you chose one of the best performing stocks and painted wide strokes in comparison to #crypto.  #DYOR people... hodling a shit crypto is not going to moon like $AMZN.  Take profits and move to the next hotness or keep it in #bitcoin.
3187 2018-09-08 01:37:39 Can dirt trucks from Fremont Speedway run with super stocks?
3188 2018-09-08 01:37:12 And lost 400milliom in stocks...Ahem
3189 2018-09-08 01:37:00 Kap (in the five days) not so hot. Stocks not gaining traction, in spite of "online sales". Bye.
3190 2018-09-08 01:36:34 @CNBC pumps pot stocks all day long, then looks down their collective noses at Elon for having ONE after work toke in a legal state.

pathetic.
3191 2018-09-08 01:36:15 Think. Colin the Loser didn’t cause Nike to lose 3 billion. Nike OBVIOUSLY inflated their stocks worth over time. What a brilliant scheme to hire a failed controversial loser, that not even the unAmerican NFL wanted, and blame their sudden HUGE loss, in a matter of a day, on him.
3192 2018-09-08 01:34:40 You know nothing about stocks and just say what is fed to you by the alt right
3193 2018-09-08 01:33:21 You don't know stocks either, those companies have nothing to do with Nike. People sold their stock.
3194 2018-09-08 01:32:56 Great! Now it's time to quit buying back stocks and raise wages.
3195 2018-09-08 01:32:39 Obama trying to still President Trump Glory because stocks never moved and memo for obama I think when growth started was day you left
3196 2018-09-08 01:32:31 If you are in a non-taxable (401k, IRA) two most common. Consider moving  to cash until after storm. No tax impact & lock in gains through trade. I am shorting various stocks that will be punished and already doing well. But short trades are not for average investors
3197 2018-09-08 01:31:46 Hahahahaha! Nagkulang ang stocks
3198 2018-09-08 01:31:29 Keep in mind these stocks $FNKO $SENS $TNDM
3199 2018-09-08 01:30:54 Tesla stocks really are going down.

Yall so soft lol
3200 2018-09-08 01:30:18 Apparently him smoking weed is causing his Tesla stocks to fall
3201 2018-09-08 01:30:06 Some don’t live your lifestyle. They only have so many entertainment $.
3202 2018-09-08 01:30:00 Local stocks fell anew on Friday as investors factored in a possible rate hike due to the higher-than-expected August inflation, alongside renewed global trade concerns.
3203 2018-09-08 01:29:31 My pot stocks went up, and I heard Obama speak. Pretty good day all around. 
3204 2018-09-08 01:29:23 Except I'm MTV and CBS were once owned by the same company and some stockholders own stocks in each of their individual companies so their is a connection between them
3205 2018-09-08 01:28:59 Nike’s sales have not only gone up. Their stocks are fine. Boycotts don’t work. Get over it. #nikeboycott
3206 2018-09-08 01:27:25 I once won a netplay set in which I got wobbled to death for 10 stocks

Think about that shit
3207 2018-09-08 01:26:23 Spliffin on stocks like Elon Musk bitches talkin bout propriety I don't give a fuck
3208 2018-09-08 01:25:24 I'm expecting 1-2 interest rate hikes this yr frm #RBI to reign in the #rupee fall

Increase in interest out go for individuals n businesses should affect thier spending

Consumer discretionary #stocks at record valuations cud b at risk

3209 2018-09-08 01:25:21 8 years. Let’s see what you say when stocks dive in October.
3210 2018-09-08 01:25:05 Sure so there should be 33,000 there not 25,000.  Not sure what Packer game has to do with it though 
3211 2018-09-08 01:24:52 Gino fasanotti .your a complete jerk. I will never support Nike.ever again. how stupid are you.theres to many other good  players.who deserve.that post. Who brain washed you. You'll get in notoriety.but lose it .In accountability. I mean STOCKS.AND BONDS.Whos whispered in you ear
3212 2018-09-08 01:24:33 Real life teaching myself stocks
3213 2018-09-08 01:24:14 "who gives a shit that the NASDAQ is up??"  Perhaps the struggling middle class whose pensions may be invested in those stocks.
3214 2018-09-08 01:23:07 Agree, he didn’t set the world on fire but he has been handy. Although probably would be lucky to find a spot in our pack next year with the amount of talent coming through? Our edge stocks mean TPJ likely goes back to the middle and he also said he prefers the middle.
3215 2018-09-08 01:22:45 For 96 months stocks up, wages up, economic growth . Only under Trump is inflation up, earning power down, racism, sexism, hatred abound with overall crises in the White House unheard of before. That’s the legacy of the self proclaimed stable genius
3216 2018-09-08 01:22:41 Agreed. An inefficient market always offers a positively skewed risk adjusted return. Applies to any market...not just stocks.
3217 2018-09-08 01:22:24 How’d Facebook and Twitter stock do this week? Is someone the reason they are down billions in the last week or is it just because stocks go up and down?
3218 2018-09-08 01:21:48 Then the other part of you realizes that 1) it’s the Giants. 2) the Division is not there immediate goal. 3) there’s a Badger game tomorrow. 4) Packer game on Sunday. 5) in players eyes jts 1 of 81 home games....does that not apply to the fans as well?
3219 2018-09-08 01:21:24 It already has rebounded sales have gone up 31 million! And stocks are being bought up
3220 2018-09-08 01:21:10 Medical devices, cybersecurity, software, and pot stocks all had some crazy moves this year

There’s always a bull market somewhere - @jimcramer 

Unfortunately for some crypto, their idea of diversifying into other markets was to buy gold and silver 
3221 2018-09-08 01:19:52 Making a point to get some stocks in this year 
3222 2018-09-08 01:19:27 Tesla's stocks dropped after the video of Elon Musk blazing went viral 
3223 2018-09-08 01:19:23 For 96 months stocks up, unemployment down, economy growing, yet only under Trump has inflation increased, earning power down, country in moral crises due to racism, sexism, divisiveness and overall chaos. That’s trumps legacy
3224 2018-09-08 01:18:52 Cos there's a lot of money to be made tanking the tesla stocks due to people short selling them
3225 2018-09-08 01:18:22 Carry on mattley. See uin the polls. My point is—trump was handed an positive economy. If only the economy was 100% the stock market. Try to take some profits from your stocks. It’s the only way to guarantee kept profits. Otherwise it’s all fake $$$ on paper only.
3226 2018-09-08 01:16:55 AGAIN! The stocks have been in the DUMPER (downward slope) UNTIL the past FIVE DAYS! Are you blind?
3227 2018-09-08 01:16:51 What is true are the HUGE opportunities in many of this Chinese stocks already falling 40-60% from ATH in just 3-4 months . In some months we will have incredible opportunities to have 2-10 baggers in 2-3 years . All of we don’t have a recession as many people think after 2020.
3228 2018-09-08 01:15:22 Again....The stocks dropped. I agree. But it is still higher than Q1. At no point during this controversy has it been the lowest this year. That's just fact. Do yes I didn't phrase my comment right, but investors would still be up a ton today if they bought in January for example
3229 2018-09-08 01:15:11 Kathy, Based on what sales. The sales report for September isn’t out yet because it is still September. The 31% increase is a reflection of August for back to school. As all retail stores (for back to school) will be up in sales. Nike stocks are dropping! ......
3230 2018-09-08 01:12:45 I still remember Mark Cuban saying he’d sell all his stocks if @realDonaldTrump won! 
I hope he did...

3232 2018-09-08 01:11:59 Même pas un an complet pour laisser une chance à la ressource !!! , On ne sait foutrement pas grand choses en terme de répartition des stocks.
Et puis à 1 par jour il y en a toujours un gros paquet de viandards qui en gardent 2 ou 3 voir pire.
3233 2018-09-08 01:11:20 This isn't rocket science. Kap's vid isn't the big boost it's being touted as. The news just broke and ONLY the past five days (NOT Sep. 2-4) have shown a SLIGHT recovery in stocks.
3234 2018-09-08 01:10:58 Como "Fifo y Lifo" los payasos criterio de valuación de stocks.
3235 2018-09-08 01:10:48 Didn’t you hear he smoked the weed? Stocks going down. Sad
3236 2018-09-08 01:09:44 I know what you mean Kate.during 8 years of obama my 401k & stocks I made me less than 4K. In 2017 alone I made 55.5K under Trump & A$$hole Obama had nothing to do with that.
3237 2018-09-08 01:09:38 Bullish mid cap tech stocks
Resource microcap stocks are atm
3238 2018-09-08 01:09:10 Stocks up 31%.   Education works.
3239 2018-09-08 01:08:33 Hoping for crypto recovery - let blockchain stocks run on asx even though they are not directly related
3240 2018-09-08 01:08:19 2nd us ni Delpo. Itataya KO lahat Ng stocks KO 
3241 2018-09-08 01:07:57 And because stocks and public humiliation is not seen as humane anymore.
3242 2018-09-08 01:07:27 But until the trade war ends we can go much worse in Chinese stocks . If rumors are true and trump adds 267bn in tariffs there won’t be an easy end . I expect 3-6 months more of negotiations . Until then I will be out of chinese stocks $IQ $HUYA $BILI $SOGO $YY $SINA $JD $BZUN
3243 2018-09-08 01:07:19 It's good that the stocks are safe
3244 2018-09-08 01:07:09 There’s two ways to approach my brother and how much he talks about stocks. 1. In 20 years I’ll say, hey bro remember when you went through that stock phase? 2. My brother is the next Warren Buffett
3245 2018-09-08 01:07:09 The Tesla stocks fall bc Elon Musk smokes a blunt on the Joe Rogan show? Come on people 
3246 2018-09-08 01:06:27 Stocks fluctuate
3247 2018-09-08 01:05:49 Market cap and stocks are not the same thing
3248 2018-09-08 01:05:27 Oil exports up. Mother's retirement stocks have gone up in value.  Economy is great. People have jobs. Tax income is up. Your vile attacks on America prove that if you win this will all be gone.
3249 2018-09-08 01:04:36 Stocks look ready to drop. A five-observation Hindenburg Omen is on the clock. Wave mappings support at top at this time. Our key indicators are generating Sell signals. Be ready for the next big move in the stock and precious metals markets. ~  Main Line Investors, Inc.
3250 2018-09-08 01:04:19 That's a bold move. I'll be thinking of you random dude on Twitter everytime I check my Tesla stocks lol
3251 2018-09-08 01:03:26 TR has beaten DB 9-0 shout outs to @iCarlyBayo for taking 11 stocks! 

Another note this is our 40th win  thank you everyone for all the great moments TR has truly been through our ups and downs but we have always persevered! 
3252 2018-09-08 01:03:18 That isn't bad. So you understand how stocks work? They fluctuate.
3253 2018-09-08 01:03:17 Still might be worth buying liquor stocks since because of him everyone else is probably drinking more
3254 2018-09-08 01:03:12 Buy stocks with a ten year perspective. Big money is usually made only over long term. If fundamentals change, you can always sell.
3255 2018-09-08 01:02:40 And their stocks?
3256 2018-09-08 01:02:30 You tonto!  All comparable company stocks dropped at the same time... Had something to do with Labor Day... Nike stocks are higher than they were before Labor Day! ¡Tonto!
3257 2018-09-08 01:02:21 Oh yes it is. My stocks are doing well, my income has increased, the nation is safer, veterans and LEO's are appreciated, DJT isn't apologizing for Am. exceptionalism.
3258 2018-09-08 01:02:03 What didn't do the industry favors at the time was the speculative market created by Silver Surfer 50 that drove varriants and specialty covers like penny stocks.
3259 2018-09-08 01:01:58 Yes but Elon said private at 420 which means he knows the company has the potential to reach that amount. Plus the stocks haven't been this low in the past 3 months. They always bounce back.
3260 2018-09-08 01:01:55 Stocks dropped and they lost 3/4 billion overnight.  I’d like to see that spreadsheet as well. 
3261 2018-09-08 01:01:33 Can't believe it took Elon Musk smoking weed to make Tesla's stocks drop, and not, idk, his botched vanity attempt with the Thailand rescue or his other BS.
3262 2018-09-08 01:01:10 Buy stocks with a ten year perspective. Big money is usually made only over long term. If fundamentals change, you can always sell.
3263 2018-09-08 01:01:04 Look at Mr. Moneybags here with money to invest in wildly popular stocks. The proletariat will rise chuck
3264 2018-09-08 01:00:54 Weed stocks however rose 50% today!

3267 2018-09-08 00:59:33 Yeap and there stocks took a hit.   What does it matter.  The press will make up anything they want to.
3268 2018-09-08 00:59:29 If you think record unemployment, record stocks, 4.2 GDP, and all this deregulation is ruining our country I don't know what to say.
3269 2018-09-08 00:59:22 If you think unemployment down, stocks up, terror control, talks with No Korea, communicating with ME, well yeah but then you might want to detox from your TDS
3270 2018-09-08 00:57:50 This is why every craft store stocks creepy doll heads.

3274 2018-09-08 00:55:26 @GlcMD oh ok thanks. I’m hoping to see enrollment news soon. I think it’ll provide some excitement . This stocks volume is painfully low.
3275 2018-09-08 00:54:27 It's free to set up, what you need depends on what stocks you want to invest in :)
3276 2018-09-08 00:54:25 This is an issue pundits from both side seem to have ~ confusing stock market changes with overall economic health. The top 1% own 38% of stocks & the rest of the top 10% own 46% ~ that only leaves 16% for the next 40% while the bottom half owns zero.
3277 2018-09-08 00:54:19 Already inquired if may extra stocks siya 
3278 2018-09-08 00:54:18 how many shares of $TSLA do you own? What other stocks do you like?
3279 2018-09-08 00:54:02 how many shares of $TSLA do you own? What other stocks do you like?
3280 2018-09-08 00:53:10 The market is always dominated by large companies. That's because large companies dominate the economy. To say the market is dominated by the "highest price" stocks is speculating, and to say that you can isolate the highest returning securities in the future is also speculating.
3281 2018-09-08 00:52:58 BARGAINS BARGAINS BARGAINS!

3282 2018-09-08 00:51:15 Fake news. Nike stocks are down 3 billions, fyi

3285 2018-09-08 00:50:24 I think you have #FakeNews because if you do a Google search on Nike Stocks you'll see that there was a loss - 0.100(0.12%)
3286 2018-09-08 00:50:04 Go look at their stocks. Nike has lost billions.
3287 2018-09-08 00:49:56 Well two college teams just canceled their Nike contracts and Nike lost over $3.75 Billion on their stocks, but ok

3290 2018-09-08 00:49:17 The only thing I care about is that we finally have a President who cares about our country. In 2 years we are all enjoying lower taxes, record low unemployment, booming economy, soaring stocks, 400% growth in black businesses, fair trade with Mexico, stronger military, etc. 
3291 2018-09-08 00:49:14 The R squared between the S&P 500 and any other US cap weighted large cap index is about 99.5%. They're all measuring essentially the same thing. That's passive. A fund that buys the lowest-priced 30% of P/B stocks intentionally does not have an R sqr with the above of 99.5%.
3292 2018-09-08 00:49:10 Swanie,
3293 2018-09-08 00:48:57 Gulp.  All while Nike sales are going up! And stocks are steady.

3296 2018-09-08 00:46:31 You can’t measure until earnings are released over the next few quarters. Way to early to tell either way. It’s not a sprint. Stocks don’t tell the story.

3298 2018-09-08 00:45:39 I got out of stocks and all non tangibles. Gold, silver is the way to go now a days. The return isn’t a great but much more stable and will or should not crash to hard.
3299 2018-09-08 00:45:35 Como dije, Moscú y La Habana tuvieron desde principio dudas sobre FPMR, pero no quisieron contrariar al PC. Uno de los mayores respaldos no vino ni de Cuba ni de la URSS sino de Vietnam. Los fusiles M16A1 que recibió FPMR provenían de stocks almacenados en Vietnam tras la guerra.
3300 2018-09-08 00:45:35 CEO of Tesla @elonmusk smokes weed during interview with @joerogan and his stocks drop! Everyone making a ordeal about them dropping but that man don’t care! when are people gonna stop tripping over weed, it doesn’t make you a mad person
3301 2018-09-08 00:44:11 Reserve your knowledge. Number of stocks may be sold out. Ha?

3307 2018-09-08 00:42:33 Comparando un poco $FNKO con $FIVE ( no he profundizado en los fundamentales de $FIVE) , comparando un poco EPS , ventas , capitalización y crecimiento esperado en ventas le veo más recorrido a $FNKO. Pero vamos , que ojalá las dos sigan tirando

3309 2018-09-08 00:41:31 True love is a hubby that stocks the fridge with rosé without having to be asked
3310 2018-09-08 00:41:16 Wtf is wrong with people who harshly judge @elonmusk (on @JREpodcast ) & sell their stocks simply because he was merely being the unedited version of himself; A human being. The world claims they don’t want lies and bullshit. Then they get some truth, and they can’t handle it.
3311 2018-09-08 00:41:15 There's the counter indicator. Time to short weed stocks. 
3312 2018-09-08 00:40:34 Or all of the e&ps minus the majors go under like the scummy coal stocks and start fresh.
3313 2018-09-08 00:40:09 Lol.. it’s called less regulation, tax cuts, tariff reform resulting in a booming economy.. all thanks to our dear President Trump.. #walkaway campaign #maga My stocks have performed well since the election of Trump because confidence is a result of the great policies for America
3314 2018-09-08 00:39:55 Bought Tesla stocks today, invested 2k from my savings acct, I'm not going to sell them unless NASDAQ delists $TSLA or Tesla goes bankrupt,  so strong and long with @Tesla @elonmusk  go!!
3315 2018-09-08 00:39:10 Speculation?  Stocks?  Oil?  Bonds?  T-Bills?  Speculation about what?  Be specific please.  This should be more than hilarious.  If you say “Jobs” I may die laughing, but I’ll take you with me! 
3316 2018-09-08 00:38:41 Wow. That’s some coded language right there. In fact, online sales were up 31% and stocks have rebounded. Perhaps you’re wrong in your assessment and their customer with whom they have street cred have no issue affording the product
3317 2018-09-08 00:38:15 Great week, Executed the pre strategy, Followed my plan every trade, caught the move on these stocks the way my Mentor is teaching us for his Accelerator Option strategy!!!!

3319 2018-09-08 00:37:41 Wrong. Wages are stagnant for low- to middle-class America. Corporate profits are up for people like you who capitalized on your #TaxScam to sell off stocks and whatnot to further enrich themselves. Whoever writes these reports are just as bad a liar as you are, Donnie. Fire them
3320 2018-09-08 00:36:32 Mishwiggles ain’t no joke! She beats up on stocks as if it’s cake batter!
3321 2018-09-08 00:36:29 I think we're entering a mania phase for tech stocks. Think nov-dec 2017 for crypto but in regular time so maybe like 6-12 months. Then crash. Buy now, set tight stop losses. Ride it all the way up 
3322 2018-09-08 00:36:01 All excited to finally fix my computer with the case I finally picked that fits all my parts.

But the one place that stocks and is open on weekends it is doing stocktake so I'm just sat outside in the car like "pls sell to me" 
3323 2018-09-08 00:35:27 Stocks fell as low as 10% after that was filmed. Haters. 
3324 2018-09-08 00:35:10 Is buying stocks in marijuana producers a good hedge for Tesla investors?

3327 2018-09-08 00:34:17 Nike's stocks went down, but their kneepads sales went way up!
3328 2018-09-08 00:34:06 Machine guns, bump stocks, multi round magazines? Are they in the Constitution, @LindseyGrahamSC ??  How bout electric lightbulbs, anesthesia, pain meds? Would you like open heart surgery without any of those? Obviously you could use a  replacement. Maybe a brain transplant too
3329 2018-09-08 00:34:03 I heard stocks dropped a couple of points over this. This will "weed" out investors with weak stomachs and keep the progressives.

I'm looking at inquiring more different stocks.

I also own gold, silver, bronze, copper (solid minted coins).
3331 2018-09-08 00:32:38 I’ve been taking profits from tech stocks and buying btc and $XMR.
3332 2018-09-08 00:32:11 Idk but their stocks are up 30 percent! Way to go! #justdoit 
3333 2018-09-08 00:31:56 What will they do when they find out? Tar and feather? The stocks? Crucify? This is madness.
3334 2018-09-08 00:31:35 We still have automatic guns and bump stocks. Those guns and accessories shouldn’t be on the streets. And regulations should also include having background checks. And why would I lie about having a gun? When I went in to buy it, they didn’t ask me any questions. WTF
3335 2018-09-08 00:31:26 Interested in stocks. Need to find somebody to teach me some things.

3341 2018-09-08 00:28:18 FAKE NEWS.  Stocks plummet
3342 2018-09-08 00:28:13 Do you own stocks? Other investments besides crypto ?
3343 2018-09-08 00:26:58 Sure. More upside to individual stocks but if you don't have access or don't want that much risk, then the ETFs aren't a bad option.
3344 2018-09-08 00:26:51 Breaking: Same Senator has stocks in New Balance
3345 2018-09-08 00:23:53 Oh neat, a screenshot of an article title from July about stocks in general. Proves everything! Fucking moron.
3346 2018-09-08 00:23:23 But real Americans are making @Nike stocks soar to new heights, hopefully New Balance likes all the #Trumpanzees bringing the hate to the brand

3354 2018-09-08 00:19:41 Most stocks up in 52 week. Due to tax cuts and strong economy. Market cap looks at future. Your guess may be correct, but you still didn’t tell whole story. In this case, that matters.
3355 2018-09-08 00:19:08 $SQ never gonna quit with earnings growing 66% in 18 and 75% in 19.  Remember Jimbo, it’s hip to be Square!!  Plus century mark right around the corner.   $SQ can be one of those stocks that never let you in!!!
3356 2018-09-08 00:18:35 BTW @TheRealHublife This pot smoking stunt by @elonmusk now needs to be tracked..  How many stocks will the Globalist Soros buy then sell to fund future Ukraines?

Who else will buy stocks in this now downgraded Gov. funded co? @FTC
3357 2018-09-08 00:17:51 Even though Tesla stocks are 260 a share I am going to buy a few just to support him.

3378 2018-09-08 00:07:44 Let’s see in 6 months and a year where their stocks are...  My guess is that 30% increase in sales won’t sustain that.  And the 54% they upset will hurt their US sales.    Only time will tell
3379 2018-09-08 00:07:37 Pretty sure he’s coming around to yours and slashing the tyres on the HD after trashing all your pinball stocks... #slashntrash

3385 2018-09-08 00:06:31 Right after the election in 2016.  Stocks took off and everything else since then is the result of Trump’s policies.
3386 2018-09-08 00:06:23 people are freaking out bc the CEO of Tesla took a hit of weed and im dead . "the stocks are dropping" .. he's a genius and a billionaire, calm down
3387 2018-09-08 00:06:06 No, Nike stocks are back up over 80 dollars per stock
3388 2018-09-08 00:05:59 @jimcramer thanks for covering the #cannabis #stocks -- What about CBWTF? Is streaming viable?  PS. Love your spot in BK. We are your neighbor... 127 Smith @ Dean.

3390 2018-09-08 00:05:40 Measuring popularity is different than sales and membership . I'm taking an information design class and just learned this today. For ex, stats show Nike's sales up and stocks recovering but things like trustworthiness and likeability down in surveys. It's complicated.
3391 2018-09-08 00:05:11 Stop it
3392 2018-09-08 00:04:57 come December I’ll start investing in stocks

3394 2018-09-08 00:03:30 Nike made BILLIONS of dollars, how exactly do you think this hurt them, their stocks are almost untouched as well lol Kappy is a godsend to them, and little stock they lost will be back up after this blows over lol
3395 2018-09-08 00:03:06 Recap of #growup 
Best speaker: @kevinolearytv by far. Some LPs are in desperate need of experienced growers and strains. It’s odd because on one hand stocks are flying while PR telling me “growers have no clue what they’re doing.” Can’t make this sh!t up. 
Back tomorrow

3396 2018-09-08 00:02:47 No, they had one day where their stocks went down 3% and now their online sales are up 31%
3397 2018-09-08 00:02:26 I understand but Telsa was on a down curve until the man started devoting 23 hrs a day to working on the line. The board should stick to their stocks
3398 2018-09-08 00:01:29 I think the media should stop making false causations and read “The Book Of Why” by @yudapearl. For instance, people do not go “Elon smoked pot, therefore I’ll sell my Tesla shares”. Stocks just go up and down for too many reasons to call
3399 2018-09-08 00:01:01 FIVE has been in the top 5 performing stocks in SNSR best performers since the April uptick. So, yesterday's beat and push to the 130s was not much of a surprise!
3400 2018-09-08 00:00:20 If his Stocks do not go up by 420%
There is no justice in the world

3403 2018-09-07 23:57:23 Hahahaha..Nike stocks surged today..how vapid can one person be?
3404 2018-09-07 23:57:16 Is there any chance these large companies are deliberately tanking their stocks to make the market look worse? Or maybe dump shares high and rebuy later at low price? Seems fishy to me Nike, Levi’s, Ford, Twitter, Tesla etc

3410 2018-09-07 23:55:57 Only reason stocks fell 10% was because he didn’t hit that spliff right
3411 2018-09-07 23:54:15 They’re really making us wait, but man when news starts flowing watch out! We’ve been fairly stagnant compared to MJ stocks. But in time (probably 6 months) we’ll be laughing all the way to the bank

3420 2018-09-07 23:51:04 The thing is Nike’s stocks have went up so  you big mad or little mad?

3443 2018-09-07 23:50:03 It's making their stocks boom so simmer down an #JustDoIt
3444 2018-09-07 23:48:57 What the hell is going on with CEO’s these past few days ? One gets arrested for rape, one smokes weed on a podcast, and now jack ma stepping down from alibaba. Too much pressure ? $tsla $baba $jd $qqq $stocks
3445 2018-09-07 23:48:28 Stocks*
3446 2018-09-07 23:48:02 Elon Musk smoked pot?

Stop the bus!

Sh*t, if you knew how many enjoy God's gift of icky sticky dankness

You'd have to sell all your stocks in order to boycott.
3447 2018-09-07 23:47:52 Yessss please ruin weed stocks. FYI short it
3448 2018-09-07 23:47:16 Elon smoking weed is, I think, a very shallow reason for Tesla's stock prices to drop. If I had money to invest in stocks, I'd be buying Tesla stocks like hotcakes, because they don't deserve this.
3449 2018-09-07 23:47:02 You forgot to mention Nike’s stocks plummeting and teams dumping the Nike brand.
3450 2018-09-07 23:46:49 Elon Musk smoking weed in the Jor Rogan interview. Tesla stocks go down 10% before opening 
3451 2018-09-07 23:46:11 Their stocks up by 34% Tomi. I think they are making profits. And on the right suck of history. Not sure about you honey.
3452 2018-09-07 23:45:51 Let Nike Hand out some of them stocks for the low.lemme know it’s real
3453 2018-09-07 23:45:29 Yes because Obama is a crybaby.
3454 2018-09-07 23:45:10 How Argentina’s Evolving Economic Crisis Unfolded The country’s inflation rate has skyrocketed & stocks have been pummeled as foreign investors flee As rising US interest rates and the dollar’s resurgence ripple through emerging markets Argentina has been among the countries ...
3455 2018-09-07 23:44:47 President Obama is getting involved in the midterms because the Dems do not see a #BlueWave. The economy is roaring back, employment is up, stocks are up. Dems are unhinged bc they smell a #RedWave coming. #AZ01 #FlipAZ01 
3456 2018-09-07 23:44:33 Tomorrows news: ”Tesla stocks plummets”
3457 2018-09-07 23:44:07 There using someone that just died for publicity, does that seem fucked up to u ? Just like when stocks used X .
3458 2018-09-07 23:44:03 annnnnnnnnnnd 35% was right xD his stocks went up for me! I am def buying a tesla now!
3459 2018-09-07 23:42:26 Doesn’t even matter. The question that matters... What will Nike think about their ad when their stocks tank? !!
3460 2018-09-07 23:41:44 average growth rate in more than 13 years.

Looking for a new talking point, the left found one: Jobs, stocks, and economic growth may be soaring, but pay is not. “Worker wages remain stagnant,” ThinkProgress declared in July.

Except pay isn’t stagnant—not by a longshot.
3461 2018-09-07 23:41:43 There are facts and there is fiction. Fiction is grand conspiracy theories. Fact in proof of crimes..bank accounts, meetings, bad business deals, bank fraud, pay offs, cover-up s , magic deals, big payments, inflated stocks and income, bankrupt claims, inflated egos
3462 2018-09-07 23:40:55 Apparently Elon Musk's Tesla stocks went down 9% after he was seen smoking a doob on Joe Rogan's podcast. That's mad its only herbal ya know
3463 2018-09-07 23:40:39 That's chump moves I bought apple stocks in 1937
3464 2018-09-07 23:40:02 People need to calm down about @elonmusk smoking weed with @joerogan. It is legal in California and soooo many people do it. Meanwhile those stocks dropping? Well those dealers probably feel better around cocaine addicts anyway
3465 2018-09-07 23:39:56 I dunno about their stocks or whatever - I just know that the new @Nike ad is responsible for some of the funniest memes I’ve seen in months - and for that, I’m thankful.  #JustDoIt
3466 2018-09-07 23:39:48 And it also doesn't mean that people can't protest, state opinions or offer alternatives without being derided or in this case, the attempt to insult seems to come a little too naturally for her. Divesting portfolio's away from roller coaster o&g stocks isn't a bad idea.
3467 2018-09-07 23:39:27 And their stocks plummeted...
3468 2018-09-07 23:38:12 Just about how big is your exposure to mj stocks . Lol
3469 2018-09-07 23:37:42 Hey @elonmusk my name's Dylan and I'm 15. I was planning on buying stocks in Tesla but now seeing you smoke with @joerogan I really don't want anything to do with Tesla or you. I don't think you understand how many people look up to you and how stupid of a decision that was.
3470 2018-09-07 23:36:53 Can't trust the judgement of anyone with white tube stocks half up their shins.
3471 2018-09-07 23:36:15 I don't even search for porn anymore I just randomly stumbled across some pages on Twitter, so now I see porn videos mixed in with my newsfeed and stocks LMAO
3472 2018-09-07 23:34:49 Fuck 2k I’ll take 4 Nike stocks instead 
3473 2018-09-07 23:34:30 You're 99% right though IMHO you forgot the pure $ part of the story(NOT stocks valuation)...#Tesla has problems, that's a fact, while the other manufacturers have plenty of $ to invest...and when(& if) they'll move those $, it's not sure Tesla will survive.
3474 2018-09-07 23:33:50 So you never buy stocks on a Friday?
3475 2018-09-07 23:33:42 What happened to Goodbye Gun Stocks!?
3476 2018-09-07 23:33:12 Sales are up Stocks will rebound
3477 2018-09-07 23:33:05 Ruth you must not have a 401k
 Lmao too bad. My stocks went crazy. Im making a lot more money.
3478 2018-09-07 23:30:28 Thought there would have been some stocks. Dude at the sais said there must be and that I shouldn’t worry...motherfucker lied to me like I’m some kid...
3479 2018-09-07 23:30:21 I bought 3 China stocks, have strong believe US will win the trade war against China even it takes 6 months or 1 year and hoped those stocks will raise. @realDonaldTrump  Great Job.
3480 2018-09-07 23:29:49 Tesla stocks went down because he didn't know how to hit a blunt lmfao
3481 2018-09-07 23:27:54 Nike stocks just element sky high this past week....
3482 2018-09-07 23:27:45 All major corporations stocks go up and down. The difference with Nike and similar companies is that they don't stay stagnant. They're constantly reinventing themselves and adjusting to the trends. It's what has made them so successful. They're not going anywhere. Get use to it.
3483 2018-09-07 23:27:38 So I just saw a news headline that says "Tesla CEO appears smoking marijuana on podcast stocks drop 69% in one month" I don't know if this is a joke or not. I thought everyone was cool with weed nowdays?
3484 2018-09-07 23:27:38 I have studied Econometrics at the university of Amsterdam. Here I have learned how to analyze the behavior of the #Crypto 's and other stocks. I have specialized myself in analyzing the behavior of crypto's and I'd like to help you all!

3492 2018-09-07 23:20:48 @RandPaul So your ok separating children from parents?

So you're ok pushing through Kavanaugh when GOP held back thousands of docs from Dems?

So you're okay with disastrous tax cuts for the middle and low income families while companies buy back their stocks for BIG profits?
3493 2018-09-07 23:20:41 Their stocks are still down
3494 2018-09-07 23:20:32 Good I don't want my Joji stocks to plummet.
3495 2018-09-07 23:20:29 Ok, that funny 
3496 2018-09-07 23:19:54 @elonmusk don’t worry about the daily stocks - when me and the homies get the bag we all buying Tesla 
3497 2018-09-07 23:19:44 AHLALA! Les statistiques, le pilotage, la confraternité qui surveille et accuse. Cela me donne l'impression que les humains sont a gérer comme des stocks de produits finis.
3498 2018-09-07 23:19:38 Bought other companies with stock, pay employees with stocks and options. S>D

3500 2018-09-07 23:18:45 YES to investing, precious metals, land, property, stocks, and cryptocurrencies.

NO to 401k, RothIRA, credit cards, bonds, and CDs.
3501 2018-09-07 23:18:36 Or Electricity, or the internet, or cell phones, or bump stocks, or insider trading of the stock market, much less fraud and money laundering of such... so what exactly was your point Lindsey...? (Enquiring minds want to know...sound familiar #golfgame )
3502 2018-09-07 23:18:08 TESLA stocks actually took a noise dive because the owner also of SpaceX took a hit off a joint on YouTube!
How ridiculous!
#AnnsWisdom
3503 2018-09-07 23:15:05 When trump was elected stocks dropped sharply the next morning. Didn’t last at all. Either will this Nike downturn.
3504 2018-09-07 23:13:40 Will you quit asking me for money !  Go use the money you got by violating the STCK act that prohibits government officials from using inside information to buy 7 stocks you were convicted of doing to line your own pockets.

Go Keesum! ( what Elway called him)
3507 2018-09-07 23:10:05 So Elon Musk smoked pot in a live show and the stock market goes crazy and his stocks plummet.
POTUS threatens wars, slurs words in public, attacks the free press, separates immigrant family's and deports parents ect.
Stock market fine.
Congress fine.
WTF! Give Trump a joint.
3508 2018-09-07 23:09:46 well... that's why you don't fuck with stocks lol, too damn volatile
3509 2018-09-07 23:09:11 #ElonMusk If his investors were as forward thinking as he is they wouldn't
be scared of his hitting a joint. He is creative, intelligent & really good at making money. Why are they tanking his stocks? "Oh, I'm so scared" seems to be the saying investors rally round. Be bold!
3510 2018-09-07 23:09:00 Ha! You forgot to mention their plummeting stocks and teams dumping their logo.
3511 2018-09-07 23:08:30 I wonder how long they'll keep their shares. I'm thinking this is one of those stocks you just ride.  Kind of like when ogi was trading at .30-.40 cents. I remember blowing them off at those prices.
3512 2018-09-07 23:08:19 You act like stocks don’t go up or down. Or back up after going down. #EconGenius
3513 2018-09-07 23:06:47 ooof omg im gettin thank bank  gonna buy stocks 
3514 2018-09-07 23:06:37 Hot Lap Time Trials are complete for the @DIRTcar_Racing Pro Stocks. (Connectivity is hit and miss tonight)
3515 2018-09-07 23:06:01 Commonwealth law punishes the eating of strawberries at any game that isn't played at Wimbledon with 12 hours in the stocks.
3516 2018-09-07 23:05:01 You do understand the DOW is just a combination of 25 different stocks they feel are representative of major US markets, and has no bearing on the stocks that make it up. Eg. 20 of the companies have had bad days, and therefore the DOW would fall, but the other 5 could have gains
3517 2018-09-07 23:01:47 Wow. That is humbling Brent. There is so much truth in those words. Warren Buffet is a modern day example I would say. As he said recently he does not know when to buy stocks just whether he should buy stocks. Thank you for this.
3518 2018-09-07 23:01:42 "I will keep that in mind for when stocks run low. But for the moment, I don't think any combat abilities will be required."
3519 2018-09-07 23:01:33 Is it the weekly stocks webinar that Bruce does or something else? I'll be there if it's the former.
3520 2018-09-07 23:01:29 Or semi-automatic rifles. Or bump stocks. Or gay marriage. Or Super-PACs.
3521 2018-09-07 23:00:59 Lmao so Tesla stocks dropped because the CEO smokes weed? . White ppl man. I tell you.
3522 2018-09-07 23:00:53 i’ve been in personal finance for three (3) days and i’m already yelling at my family about stocks and bonds
3523 2018-09-07 23:00:30 Great. He's genius. 
Those stocks will come back up.
3524 2018-09-07 22:59:30 And it won't!! Good time to buy #Nike stocks trust mi ...
3525 2018-09-07 22:58:56 Yeah he outta reach of the government for running stocks?
3526 2018-09-07 22:58:26 They thought their stocks would soar but ended up doing just the opposite! Serves them right!
3527 2018-09-07 22:58:22 @elonmusk Elon, I’m not connected to any of your stocks. This is personal. I know what it is. You know what it is. Your a Genius, so take a little advice. Learn to handle it. You have a LOT to give. But you must survive.

3529 2018-09-07 22:56:26 If @Tesla shareholders listened to the content of the @joerogan pod, instead of watching a 10 second manufactured clip from the news, there stocks would have increased. @elonmusk is a genius, and a great dude.

3535 2018-09-07 22:53:50 What was #Nike stocks before the #justdoit campaign with @Kaepernick7 ?
3536 2018-09-07 22:53:39 I thought Elon Musk was smart. but smoking weed so openly was a dumb ass move on his part. stoners aren’t buying Teslas.  6% loss In stocks so far.   What’s 6 percent of 23billion again?  That’s the most expensive weed on the PLANET now. Joe Rogan could sell $10,000grams.  #tesla
3537 2018-09-07 22:52:48 Tesla stocks fell 10% just bc Elon Musk took one hit of the blunt?Lmfaoo y’all some bitches I swear
3538 2018-09-07 22:52:47 Damn bro someone stole the stocks?
3539 2018-09-07 22:52:36 How much would the world change if they got rid of the education curriculum and made a new one. This isn’t 1980 anymore. Why aren’t kids taught about stocks and writing code? Why aren’t kids taught about investing or managing money? Because they also don’t want to see people win!
3540 2018-09-07 22:52:29 They lost $3 billion in stocks the first day. Might be back to neutral by now.
3541 2018-09-07 22:51:18 Please stop tweeting this, my stocks have gone down enough 
3542 2018-09-07 22:50:55 This is a delusional comment! Really as your looking at your Stocks on a daily basis 
3543 2018-09-07 22:49:36 Their stocks also plunge but will that be reported?
3544 2018-09-07 22:49:27 Someone told me hes stocks doubled from 7 to 14 milion
3545 2018-09-07 22:49:02 By opposing controls on high capacity mags, bump stocks & military type rifles and background checks. Especially at gun shows.   They do everything possible to bump up body counts. And now we know they funneled $Ms of dirty Russian cash they are like any other terrorists
3546 2018-09-07 22:47:42 #ElonMusk smokes marijuana & drinks alcohol on social media and stocks for Tesla go up?  #PeopleNeedToCheckTheirPriortities
3547 2018-09-07 22:47:38 @BarackObama @POTUS FYI..stocks went sky rocketing the day after the  2016 election!That enough oughta tell u what We The People’s votes did to the market. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist 2 c what the name Trump alone has done 2 the market let alone his actions#MAGA
3548 2018-09-07 22:47:27 I’m suggesting the traditional way to think of “active” is concentrated SELECTION based on perceived mispricing or TIMING (either stocks/cash or relative tactical asset class rotation).  To say “DFA is active” can be confused w/this traditional association/not what they do
3549 2018-09-07 22:46:53 @cvpayne Damn brother Charles you can truly move...thought you were all about the stocks. This is why I watch your show, smart articulate and all around cool guy..
3550 2018-09-07 22:46:40 Stocks have almost no correlation to how well a company is doing.
3551 2018-09-07 22:45:45 Didn’t stocks drop though?
3552 2018-09-07 22:45:34  Review these #stocks that made all-time highs: $PANW, $FTNT, $FDS, $ADP, $JKHY
3553 2018-09-07 22:45:34 These are the 5 stocks in finance sector that yesterday hit all-time highs:
$AJG, $PGR, $ORI, $ICE, $ROL
3554 2018-09-07 22:45:06 I did buy some Nike stocks cuz of idiots like her. I'm not a Nike fan but I do support those who stand up for people's rights.
3555 2018-09-07 22:45:02 Politicians are delighted when interest rates are falling because it enables the creation of short term artificial and illusionary wealth through price inflation in assets such as real estate and stocks. However, every party comes to an end at some point, usually with a hangover.
3556 2018-09-07 22:44:09 Make the comeback like two stocks with SoPo
3557 2018-09-07 22:44:00 $SPY Some good momentum stocks that really made the difference this week. $DLTH $ROKU $BJ $ZS  May want these on your watch list.
3558 2018-09-07 22:43:13 @PervGriffin   I cannot believe all that's going on over Elon Musk smoking  weed/ tobacco mix! Stocks dropping???? But if someone drinks it's okay???? He said he's not a smoker??!!
3559 2018-09-07 22:43:11 Buying stocks an shit
3560 2018-09-07 22:42:16 Stocks are down!? Buy!!!!!
3561 2018-09-07 22:41:58 @elonmusk I just created my first twitter account to ask you this, I understand the beef between you smoking a blunt and your stocks going nuts but I still want part of it. Who doesn't, right? I'm just wondering how to become apart of Tesla, other than investing my money.
3562 2018-09-07 22:41:48 Their stock is just fine, it’s fluctuated no more than two points since the ad announcement, and it’s now back up to pre-ad levels. Also, stocks aren’t online sales.
3563 2018-09-07 22:41:47 Thank God you’re better at picking stocks than you are at picking football teams! Go {Dirty}Birds! @AtlantaFalcons!
3564 2018-09-07 22:41:33 My who gave me that information they lost like 4 billion dollars in stocks the very next day. Was it the same outlet that told you Trump was not going to receive 270 delegates
3565 2018-09-07 22:40:31 Same, man. I was thinking stocks when I wrote that — it’s what I’ve been focused on recently. Crypto the same, still. I’ve never been so interested in anything in my life. This shit only second to music.
3566 2018-09-07 22:40:12 I agree but would suggest the typical Trump voter is unlikely to own stocks let alone Tesla stocks. You are spot on about the morality issue (not just in your country) regardless. Being moralistic has replaced being moral
3567 2018-09-07 22:40:02 It’s Nike’s online sales that went up 31%, not their stocks, but go on
3568 2018-09-07 22:39:45 ? criteria?   the stocks I trade are liquid leaders with institutional foot prints.  the volume ramp gives it away. they typically have a high launch angle and have established a trend.
3569 2018-09-07 22:39:17 my mixtapes gonna drop as hard as teslas stocks #watchout
3570 2018-09-07 22:37:43 How is a committee choosing a subset of the large/mid cap market (S&P 500) *not* active but a rules-based approach to targeting, say, the lowest-priced 30% of P/B stocks (DFLVX) *is* active? What’s the distinction?
3571 2018-09-07 22:36:31 You backtest that? Seems a ton of stocks would screen well based on the valuation methodology with low rates. I guess owning the whole market wouldn’t have been so bad as of late.
3572 2018-09-07 22:35:32 デルポトロが決勝進出。相手は錦織かジョコビッチか。
3573 2018-09-07 22:35:31 What do you think will happen to the stocks after nearly a third more sales? Serious question. I'm not making fun.
3574 2018-09-07 22:35:14 I’m trying to learn stocks...pray for me because math is not my forte...
3575 2018-09-07 22:35:03 That seems reasonable. Juniors explorers will lag the producers a bit. Time to get out is when your cab driver tells you what U stocks you should buy :)
3576 2018-09-07 22:34:34 It’s more accurate to say you hold an index to capture the returns available from a cap-weighted index that’s dominated by the biggest & highest-prices stocks. That’s all it is. Additional expected returns are possible from emphasizing/overweighting higher returning securities
3577 2018-09-07 22:34:30 What about, record high stocks, record low unemployment. A constant 4% gdp growth, safest borders in history
3578 2018-09-07 22:34:24 [me before an interview]

Alright let’s see where your stocks are at today
3579 2018-09-07 22:33:45 quit with the hashtags... anyways you think trump becoming president had nothing to do with the unemployment drop? also I don't know too much about stocks, but I think anyone can buy any share in stocks if they really want to... stock market doesn't cater to any eco status
3580 2018-09-07 22:33:43 $SPY A rough week for many stocks and overall indexes however traders in the right stocks had a significant advantage to actually profit.
3581 2018-09-07 22:33:16 I think @alexapo1980 has found a twin. Just wait till they start comparing sheep stocks 
3582 2018-09-07 22:33:02 Nice work! What stocks you into? Best wishes from the UK
3583 2018-09-07 22:32:31 Also, if memory serves, the DJIA didn't have 30 stocks until another reconstitution in 1927 or '28, is that correct?
3584 2018-09-07 22:32:29 Twitter just asked me to do a survey....I did. It was totally weird about vegan food, stocks and Bollywood. Just let me edit tweets for god’s sake
3585 2018-09-07 22:32:05 Yes just a 56 year old here.. Shit might hit the fan..Be careful.. Stocks overpriced. Crazy man making everything more expensive.. Like lighting an inflation fire..
3586 2018-09-07 22:32:02 Thanks for boosting my Nike stocks, Bitch
3587 2018-09-07 22:31:52 The 8yr #ObamaSOCIALISTDemocrat taxation/regulatory orgy didn’t crush the economy because the FederalReserve FLOODED THE STOCK MARKET/ECONOMY WITH $TRILLIONS!

Ergo, stocks surged & the wider economy didn’t collapse but stagnated massively. 

America survived IN SPITE of #Obama!
3588 2018-09-07 22:31:25 Nice. AND
How bout Those Who Work for Publicly Listed Corp$ ( Wall Mart, Amazon, Google et al) By PUBLIC LAW) make it Manditory to pay Workers in STOCKS and or BONDS.. So they can have Leverage as Collateral and or EQUITY (Which is How 'USAs INEQUALITY problemo can get Reduced)?
3589 2018-09-07 22:30:46 We have operated as a successful trade service for awhile. We got enough shit from our members, that we finally decided to enter the Twitter-verse as a biz acct. Hello Tweeters, Twattelers, Tweeties, whatever the hell you call yourselves!  #myfirsttweet #trading #stocks
3590 2018-09-07 22:29:47 Uh oh. This didn’t age well. 
But I’ll take your advice and say to you, “Nike stocks SOAR! You may not like it...but accept it!!!” LMFAO
You weren’t the target audience, Nike knew exactly what they were doing, and they knew exactly the type of people they were appealing to. 
3591 2018-09-07 22:29:12 #BoycottNike look at the Nike stocks
3592 2018-09-07 22:28:32 So I watched the @joerogan and @elonmusk podcast and I don't think people getting salty at Elon is justified ... 1st thing Joe lit the joint and 2nd Elon took 1 puff ...stocks dipping and execs leaving the company is crazy
3593 2018-09-07 22:26:48 Tesla stocks down 6% today 
3594 2018-09-07 22:26:26 If the stocks can rally too...
3595 2018-09-07 22:26:18 We have become disposable. Correction looms. #stocks
3596 2018-09-07 22:26:03 First, Not listening to you. Secondly, their stocks are looking just fine. I just bought a new running outfit and 3 pairs of shoes. Lastly, quit being a racist asshole and "TAKE A KNEE" already!!
3597 2018-09-07 22:25:01 Everyone knows it will happen, nobody knows when.  Feels very close  though. CNBC  in crypto era shilled ripple and now it's shilling pot  stocks pumping and whatnot.. What a joke, give me a break. Same story, but "stocks are safe to buy".
3598 2018-09-07 22:24:44 I don't care if Nike stocks go up or down. I don't care if Nike sales are up or down. I'll never buy Nike shoes ,shirts or socks again.
3599 2018-09-07 22:24:18 I'm not embarrassed by my 401k, stocks and pay increase.....but, you do make a good point.
3600 2018-09-07 22:24:12 Nike killed Mac miller so their stocks would rise #nikesonmyfeet
3601 2018-09-07 22:22:59 Tesla stocks crashed cuz Elon faked smoked a blunt, people are really retarded.
3602 2018-09-07 22:22:27 Hahahahaha!  Stocks been up everyday since the announcement world wide sales up 31%. Hahahaha! I hope you’re not a broker or financial advisor hahahaha
3603 2018-09-07 22:20:59 ...but I've heard that cited as a major industry, income & foreign exchange earner in that sphere. Wouldn't stocks crash in the wake of this your announcement?
3604 2018-09-07 22:20:42 So @elonmusk takes one uneventful puff on a joint, and Tesla stocks go down instantly! People are such narcs...
3605 2018-09-07 22:20:30 One more thing, be prepared to shortsell stocks soon...
3606 2018-09-07 22:20:21 Trump has no shame as well; he is making our deficit even worse. Maybe he should pay down the deficit that he is adding to. The housing crisis took place in 2008 before Obama became president. Stocks fell before Obama became president. Trump supports racism, bigotry and top 1%

3609 2018-09-07 22:18:51 the stocks did drop but I think thats more attributed to elon being unpredictable.
3610 2018-09-07 22:18:25 ok you just showed you DON'T know how it works, "cupcake". A stock is a share in the ownership of a company. Stock represents a claim on the company's assets and earnings. Stocks can go down and sales can go up (or vise-versa) because they are independent to each other. Read more
3611 2018-09-07 22:18:23 tremendously arrested stocks,
fragmentation and angsts, timed
with no-fly seating.
3612 2018-09-07 22:18:14 I was hoping the whole Kaepernick controversy would allow Nike stocks to plummet. Not because I agree or disagree with what he stands for(in the this case kneels) but just so I could afford their merchandise.
3613 2018-09-07 22:18:08 I cant believe stocks went down after he smoked that joint. Those two podcasts will be amazing though
3614 2018-09-07 22:18:00 Online sales up 31%, stocks also close up.  It is good marketing to be Anti-YOU.
3615 2018-09-07 22:17:11 Have a good week Anthony.. I'm not interested in stocks to Monday.. Waiting for #52 to chase the porn star mustache guy / Danica's boyfriend around Sunday night..
3616 2018-09-07 22:16:53 Go jon stocks brother dylan
3617 2018-09-07 22:16:49 It has become quite common for retired gunsmiths from the police and military to work for criminal organizations after retirement(sometimes early retirement) in Brazil, whether to contribute to overall maintenance of existing stocks of weapons or to set up manufacturing.
3618 2018-09-07 22:15:28 Just wanted to instill a little patience. It is a great thing that stocks have not moved much. That is an opportunity to buy more. Some like CCO will move first as institutional investors can buy it without moving the stock too much. Not so with Juniors.
3619 2018-09-07 22:15:07 Oil & Gas Exploration stocks $DRIP-ping today
3620 2018-09-07 22:14:49 Nike stocks up Nike online sales up 31 percent. The right leaning media is silent.
3621 2018-09-07 22:14:37 @onemillioncubs Yep, mine stocks Weds afternoon, very informative, told me there appears to be no rhyme or reason as to what is sent in and replenishment.  Told me a store can go un represented and cards not stocked for months and just sit in the back because Target employees don
3622 2018-09-07 22:14:24 Its Friday, im off this weekend, my stocks closed out in the green today, let’s get it.
3623 2018-09-07 22:14:17 There goes everyone's pot stocks gains
3624 2018-09-07 22:13:47 apple stocks rise by 30%.
3625 2018-09-07 22:13:47 Yep, mine stocks Weds afternoon, very informative, told me there appears to be no rhyme or reason as to what is sent in and replenishment.  Told me a store can go un represented and cards not stocked for months and just sit in the back because Target employees don’t stock it.
3626 2018-09-07 22:13:35 Bet Trump has Nike stocks.
3627 2018-09-07 22:13:05 @MissRobinAustin Nike's sales and stocks are surging after the airing of yesterday's commercial. All the dumb racist christian lowlifes were wrong about that one
3628 2018-09-07 22:11:49 Note to self: whenever old white men who reference stocks plummeting and share random graphs on Facebook, you invest in those stocks.
3629 2018-09-07 22:11:35 "Win or lose, everybody gets what they want out of the market."- Ed Seykota        I always come back to this quote, so true of trading and of life.  #trading #tradingpsychology #stocks #stockmarket #TradingStrategy
3630 2018-09-07 22:11:02 I want to buy stocks in legal marijuana distribution. This is an upcoming booming business. You have to be stupid not to buy stocks this early in the game esp with a high demand.
3631 2018-09-07 22:10:58 His weed  stocks probably went sky high
3632 2018-09-07 22:10:36 Nike stocks went up 31% so who gives a crap?
3633 2018-09-07 22:10:11 Yea, I'm sure the stocks were wrong too. Lol
3634 2018-09-07 22:09:28 Tesla's stocks dropped today because of it. I find it hilarious 
3635 2018-09-07 22:09:16 With all the other stocks out there, I’ll wait a quarter or two to pull the trigger.
3636 2018-09-07 22:08:03 Jeez.
They are about to screw the last funny thing in stocks.
3637 2018-09-07 22:07:54 That they wanted to become relevant again by stirring up controversy and take advantage of a potential increase in profit? Lol. Make no mistake, morals aren’t involved. It’s all about money. Folks are buying stocks left and right while they’re “cheap” bc they won’t stay that way.
3638 2018-09-07 22:07:53 You're right. But I remember when game ling was legalized in Atlantic City and Resorts International and other gambling stocks went wild. Hard to tell when this ends but I would wait for 3 months of sales in Canada.
3639 2018-09-07 22:05:30 @elonmusk I feel the biggest screw you Elon could do right now is start his own Weed company. No lie, it would probably be one of the best. That being said today is a good day to buy Tesla stocks if you’re in it for the long run.
3640 2018-09-07 22:03:54 I can actually take stocks at a reasonable percent and camp even harder. I’m so happy
3641 2018-09-07 22:03:51 I was just thinking the same thing! I think you guys are in serious trouble and I also think this is gonna get VERY UGLY before ANYTHING gets better. Take your money outa the banks and stocks something is a brewing!
3642 2018-09-07 22:03:42 The stocks i was trading is irrelevant.. My mentality was the downfall. the first couple times i thought i was invincible.. Didn't think I could lose... BIG EGO, no discipline, relied on luck at times... no systemic process essentially... Account management was nonexistent
3643 2018-09-07 22:03:22 I don't think you should bother "picking stocks", but even if you do, you need to realise that it's the last part of a bigger process. For example, what proportion of your wealth should be in growth assets such as shares, compared to more defensive investments?
3644 2018-09-07 22:03:06 Time to buy stocks in Telsa, Elon Musk hit the pookie on Joe Rohan podcast and he stocks falling lol
3645 2018-09-07 22:02:37 Which stocks ? I am sure our bio twitter can claw back few $$s :).
3646 2018-09-07 22:02:07 Believe it or not & check the data if you so desire, but sector whippingboy Goldcorp(se) $GG is doing better in 2018 year to date than the following stocks:

Newmont $NEM
Barrick $ABX
Agnico $AEM
Franco-Nevada $FNV
Randgold $GOLD

Better a corpse than a zombie?
3647 2018-09-07 22:01:28 that’s why the stocks went down lolz

3650 2018-09-07 22:00:56 Yeah everyone who isn’t already rich. You understand that the stock market only helps people with stocks...which is a statistical minority in this country
3651 2018-09-07 22:00:19 This is exactly why I’d never pay for an AFR subscription...or even an article. A colleague aptly described as “downmarket WSJ, some guys down the pub writing about stocks”. True.

3661 2018-09-07 21:56:46 sry,I am no daytrader, but I check the longterm charts, where could be the bottom (to sell stocks) and how much is possible upwards...3 times a year, I buy a call when the heat is on (second time was at 12.250/12.160 and selling 12390/12.430 mid August). Now I fear a lower  low

3664 2018-09-07 21:53:24 Absolutely, and one complements the other.  Utility increase drives speculative increase.  This is the major factor distinguishing crypto from stocks, the fact that crypto 'is' the product, and self-reinforces its value.
3665 2018-09-07 21:53:14 Why are you incapable of civil conversation, grumpy bear? You've forgotten this convo is about the small percentage of Americans invested in stocks. Keep up.
3666 2018-09-07 21:53:06 Sean, Musk was given away out so he could step down. The DOD / Military / POTUS / SPACE X WORKS WITH military and DOD. He must of been so dirty in selling out USA. A man this smart does not do these things 1 st stocks / then Rogan and POT. SECURITY CLEARANCE /. RED PILL coming.

3669 2018-09-07 21:52:14 The definition of #insanity? To see @Tesla stocks crash after @elonmusk Taking a puff from @joerogan joint.
#WTF

No Tesla nor SpaceX if it wasn't for the ingenuity of this man. I'll rather invest in companies of a man who care about #humanity, not in #privacy leaching #Facebook!
3670 2018-09-07 21:52:06 Tesla stocks are plummeting as we speak, they need to get it together or money will be lossssst.
3671 2018-09-07 21:51:34 Nike online sales are up 31% after a slight dip following the Kaepernick ad campaign. He didn't mention stocks, which will rise now that sales are up. Who knew reading comprehension was so hard.

3678 2018-09-07 21:49:24 Good for you that actually picking winners   has zero to do with your portfolio. 
Might want to consider researching stocks
3679 2018-09-07 21:49:09 The other thing worth bearing in mind is that other charity shops are selling their stocks at far more reasonable prices and those are the ones that I go back to time and again. You have to bear in mind that they’re  also run by volunteers so that excuse isn’t overly relevant
3680 2018-09-07 21:48:49 Elon Musk hit the blunt on a live YT podcast & Tesla’s stocks dropped 9% 
3681 2018-09-07 21:48:39 tesla stocks really dropped by 6% over Elon Musk puffing on a blunt. He didn't even inhale LMAO
3682 2018-09-07 21:48:22 why do my family think I’m doing drugs because ‘my eyes are puffy’ the tired/emotional JLC effect, buy it now while stocks last x
3683 2018-09-07 21:48:18 My trade ideas are very simple.. I don't post a ton of different stocks with a million ideas... Its very straight forward for people to make $.... On that note.. Have a great weekend my friends + enjoy time with family/friends.. Next week we will make great trades together! :-)
3684 2018-09-07 21:48:04 Although people state that stocks rise and fall, and one can’t really disagree with the statement, they should reflect on cause and effect. You illistrated the effect well and I do not believe for one moment that the ruling was not the cause.  Thanks for sharing.  I will too.
3685 2018-09-07 21:47:05 how to get rich faster: 1 record @elonmusk smoking marijuana 5 times thats 50% down, 2 buy @Tesla stocks, 3 wait a week and sell everything

3687 2018-09-07 21:46:24 Healthcare stocks have quadrupled under the the ACA. While premiums and drug prices have continued to increase.
3688 2018-09-07 21:46:06 Cheers mate now my second pair of stocks
3689 2018-09-07 21:45:50 I guess what I’m taking issue with is how a fund with half the holdings NOT growth stocks using Mstar categorization is categorized growth. And they told me now Im stuck there til Feb which isn’t adding value to advisors looking at fund. Thanks for your convo!!
3690 2018-09-07 21:45:39 Was busy watching urg close on the lows. More u stocks had a bad week. Most aren’t moving up with spot
3691 2018-09-07 21:45:38 Even in my dreams, I think about stocks.
3692 2018-09-07 21:45:15 No intelligent investor is going to get stocks in a brand that just lost billions
3693 2018-09-07 21:44:25 Well it looks like not only does smoking weed depress people it depresses stocks as well. Tesla Stock @Tesla #Business #stocks #investing #drugs #weed #WallStreet #JustSayNO
3694 2018-09-07 21:43:49 Buy PUT as an insurance for stocks so Sell Put, the insurance seller usually makes the money.
3695 2018-09-07 21:43:45 apple stocks rise by 69%.
3696 2018-09-07 21:43:25 I'm not saying that it makes a difference. But it's strange how we never see this in any other markets. And unlike shitty stocks, there's never short squeezes in gold.
3697 2018-09-07 21:42:39 A couple percent less than their all time high. 

Made gains during a down market. 

You clearly don’t know how anything about stocks or value in general. 

Try to use your brain next time, trust me; it does wonders. (:

3699 2018-09-07 21:41:27 Martha Marth Martha. Their unveiling of the new billboard and introducing him as the new face of the campaign is why the stocks plummeted. We had different ads in mind
3700 2018-09-07 21:40:58 This bad joke is the real reason Tesla stocks are down 1001%
3701 2018-09-07 21:40:41 You should start selling your stocks and shares on the channel. Like, comment, subscribe, buy shares. Everyone will want Big Wangers inc inside their portfolios
3702 2018-09-07 21:40:21 Now is a bad time to own the banks, IMO.

6 levels you’re not gonna get better on. Loan growth, NIM, expenses, credit, tax rate, buybacks.

Starting backwards, buybacks are in the stocks. Tax rates can’t go lower. Credit - charge offs at cyclical troughs + banks bleeding reserves
3703 2018-09-07 21:39:58 It really doesn’t as long vince is making the money and the stocks are up he doesn’t care whether someone is booed or cheered Roman is top star regardless they just go that to get on Roman fans nerves really lol

3705 2018-09-07 21:39:33 The one MAJOR issue I see for the Midterms is Ahab Trumps pursuit of the Trade "White Whale" GUTTING 'ALL" but FANG stocks (FOR THE MOST PART) this year. The largest voter base in the US are BOOMERS. Most (myself included) portfolios are  N O T filled with FANG stocks!
3706 2018-09-07 21:38:34 Smoke weed and buy some weed stocks. Its literally lit.
3707 2018-09-07 21:38:21 I just got back from a nice trip around Cairo. I went shopping to buy some gifts and then went to the Nile river for a cruise you can rent a boat with dinner very nice. No trading today. I will check my stocks and see what happens .
3708 2018-09-07 21:38:07 You dont get to ask for a discount at the Apple store if you are simultaneously whining about having to trek to Manhattan Beach from your home in PV, where all you do with your computer is "check my stocks."
3709 2018-09-07 21:37:04 They bought back stocks with that cut, not helped the workers.  Trickle down has NEVER worked, no matter how many times the Republicans try it.
3710 2018-09-07 21:36:45 The S&P 500 fell each day this week.
But this is nearly not important. What is more interesting is the SEC warned about hype and bullshiting in cannabis stocks but didn’t do the same for marijuana ETFs. Anyways! Watch out. 
Be an educated investor!
3711 2018-09-07 21:36:31 I mean you can pull a Nordstrom, Macy's or Chip stock out of the hat but ....For the most part we have been in a "Rolling Bear Market" and the word INFRASTRUCTURE" no longer appears in Trumps vocabulary as construction /material stocks have been FLUSHED DOWN THE TOILET!
3712 2018-09-07 21:36:18 AR 15s nor AK 47s, bump stocks nor cop-killer bullets
3713 2018-09-07 21:36:07 Stocks and sales are different...
3714 2018-09-07 21:35:35 Do you know the difference between stocks and sales? Cause it seems you don't...
3715 2018-09-07 21:34:57 Yeah and their stocks plummeted 3% 
3716 2018-09-07 21:34:14 They also didn't envision high-powered rifles, semi-automatic weapons, and bump stocks. If we're gonna be all strict constructionist and "what did The Founders intend?" we should just assume no advancement in any area since 1788, except as amended.

3727 2018-09-07 21:32:39 This is maths works if you make 150 million and lose 3 billion in stocks and after trumps tweet likely another 1-2 billion you are not winning
3728 2018-09-07 21:32:36 I agree! That is the most asinine comment ever! Companies have been hiring people, before the tax cuts! Job growth in America was doing quite well, before Trump! One time bonuses does not help people, over time! And corporations have themselves raises & Bought Back their stocks!
3729 2018-09-07 21:32:20 Nike stocks are up.
3730 2018-09-07 21:32:17 My stocks & investments skyrocketed once President Trump took office.  They showed minimal growth when Obama was in office.  Barak you lying Muslim keep telling that crap and you will continue believing it.
3731 2018-09-07 21:32:04 @NYSE @NASDAQ @jimcramer @MadMoneyOnCNBC Booyah this week- glad I sold TLRY when over $95. Kept the rest the same: CCI TGT CGC PENN MJ. Love my stocks. And have loved the show for many years. Congrats Jim! And our #Eagles showed no signs of slowing down. Defense!

3732 2018-09-07 21:31:59 Guess what? If you leave your cash in the account, it will be considered as credit for the bank. If your bank goes bankrupt, it is gone. With stocks it’s different. These are considered special assets and are transferred to a new bank in the event of a crash. Keep cool & invest!
3733 2018-09-07 21:31:02 I never done drugs I rather buy some stocks or Nike's
3734 2018-09-07 21:30:26 How are the stocks today?

3737 2018-09-07 21:29:56 If you look at performance of, say, Chinese v us stock markets, US stocks have outperformed strongly since tariff talk started. That represents a direct transfer of wealth to the us from China. Cheers.
3738 2018-09-07 21:29:22 Trump's tax break that was supposed to pay more employees better was instead used by heads of corporations to give themselves bonuses and the buyback stocks.
3739 2018-09-07 21:29:03 Russell3000 before this week was at an all time high.  Pretty broad indicator of the overall market breath, don't you think?  I mean it overs the 3000 largest US stocks.  Also Small Caps have led the way this year again the market is beyond the S&P.

3743 2018-09-07 21:26:57 great time to lose 9 percent stocks because of a false societal taboo
3744 2018-09-07 21:26:17 El cambio de portafolio no es un indicador. La cuenta corriente será negativa a esta paridad del $U. Eso implica deseq de stocks tb
3745 2018-09-07 21:26:08 Remember Quantitative Easing by the Fed?  That was Obama's way of creating economic growth... $10+ trillion of debt dumped on taxpayers so big banks could pay off their losses and use rest to manipulate stocks  for HUGE profit$. Banks still have trillions of risky credit derivs
3746 2018-09-07 21:25:22 Someone can explain me what is the problem with Elon musk smoking weed, I read that stocks of his company dropped, but why?
3747 2018-09-07 21:24:46 @CNBCFastMoney so rediculous the SEC warns people about POT stocks for fraud. What about tesla what about opec with controlling supply and demand, your people on tv manipulate the market , Citron regularly tries to manipulate market for their gain. So SEC should just keep quiet
3748 2018-09-07 21:24:33 My Kroger loyalty is waning now that I know that meijer stocks my favorite frozen pizzas
3749 2018-09-07 21:24:32 wonder if @ClayTravis has tweeted about this lol he was so excited about nike losing a point or two in stocks 
3750 2018-09-07 21:24:10 I heard on the radio that their stocks fell, but with sales like that, I doubt it
3751 2018-09-07 21:23:41 POT Stocks are the new Bit-CON
3752 2018-09-07 21:23:39 Can't wait to see this. I have 20k of stocks that tanked but I can care less. Long Tesla for life!
3753 2018-09-07 21:23:15 sounds like a good buy. Someone is willing to play devils advocate and say maybe this is nothing. Way more appealing then shit-stocks that they decorate to look like this is official business bigger then you and your sense of humor and you just could never really understand.
3754 2018-09-07 21:23:06 Their stocks are way up though.
3755 2018-09-07 21:22:42 FYI, once sales reports are more publicized, stock prices would follow. The stocks alone, without any sales information factored in, are just speculation... that speculation is about profits.

3758 2018-09-07 21:21:19 So reading through the Trump Tweet comments about #NikeAd advert/Burning Shoes #NikeBoycott - comments & reports say Nike sales increased by 31% after the ad. Karl from Channel Nine reports Nike stocks plummeted 3%. Is this a pro-Trump spin by #Auspol news for the sake of it?
3759 2018-09-07 21:21:09 can you buy stocks with EBT?
3760 2018-09-07 21:20:52 If i wasn't already in other stocks, then yes I would've probably jumped in on $AAPL puts ....I had a few meetings today so I wasnt' at the computer for a couple hours..
3761 2018-09-07 21:20:04 "the sharp drop in AAPL stock ......... shows that should not even the untouchable tech sector would be spared, a scary preposition for the S&P500, in which over half the gains have come from just six tech stocks, with AAPL among them."
3762 2018-09-07 21:19:28 Thanks.
2. I mean would you jump in on the news that AAPL gets hurt by new tariffs right away or would you keep playing the stocks you had planned for the day and then plan the AAPL trade for the next day?
3763 2018-09-07 21:18:44 @BarackObama made the pain of 08 recession last way longer than it should. He wanted to focus on healthcare which is fine but not right after a freeking econ collapse. I saw mid class families lose everything...stocks home jobs spouse. Juan your offensive.

3770 2018-09-07 21:16:01 My idea, from a long while ago, was to tax corporations where the gap between highest compensated (incl wages, bonuses, stocks etc) and lowest compensated was over a certain pecent, and give tax credits to corporations that are below another percent gap. 1/2
3771 2018-09-07 21:15:49 Y’all betta invest in some Iraqi stocks
3772 2018-09-07 21:15:29 Why market moves higher but your portfolio doesn't? The reason is simple, stocks in a mutual fund are selected by the fund manager and they may be very different from indexes you see on TV. You might be missing out bcoz of a fund manager's wrong bet #IndiaMFInvesting
3773 2018-09-07 21:15:02 Your stocks likely did well the last 10 years.
3774 2018-09-07 21:14:47 This kid & Trump are laughing stocks of Twitter! His eye rolling, the gal behind picking her nose and wiping it on a flag-like scarf and the kids in the audience shows how many folks in Billings only get paid to show up for Trump - parents pimping out kids for Trump & $$$!  SAD!
3775 2018-09-07 21:14:26 They would tell me to stop buying OTC stocks and I might be ok. Sir did you really mean to buy $3 in stock with $4.95 commission. Yes it's called being a painter.
3776 2018-09-07 21:14:24 Stocks dropped because people now know that @elonmusk doesn't seem to know how to inhale properly. All those cuban cigars he puffs, no doubt.
3777 2018-09-07 21:14:21 lol i have 2 stocks but i also will like to purchase twitter as well 
3778 2018-09-07 21:13:46 Nike’s move was in line with the S&P 500 performance for the week.  Stocks value fluctuate on a daily basis.

3780 2018-09-07 21:11:58 Trump admin is reaping the economic rewards that Obama admin had sown.  It doubled down by ensuring the rich gets super richer with permanent tax cuts (35% to20%). Stocks jump and Wall Street celebrates.   Financial regulations be damned - the current admin did away with that too
3781 2018-09-07 21:10:56 Sure! EV are the future, performance matters. Tesla stocks are going to increase asap
3782 2018-09-07 21:10:20 Don't sell at this ridiculous price wait until the fomo is done with weed stocks
3783 2018-09-07 21:10:12 Nike sales going up since Sunday prove once again that the stock market isn't always an indicator of success. 90% of the stocks are owned by the 10% wealthy folks, who are rich and white. In other words, people that are primarily out of touch

3785 2018-09-07 21:09:47 @MKBHD Marques what do you think about Elon's two top CEO'S jumping ship his stocks dropping 11 percent and him smoking weed with Joe Rogan?
3786 2018-09-07 21:09:02 I see this as a good time to invest! Bunch of scaredy cats dropped out over a joint.. that has nothing to do with the companies success and the stocks will 100% go back up. Perfect dip to get your money in.
3787 2018-09-07 21:08:07 Losts of companies take a loss on their stocks and recover.
3788 2018-09-07 21:07:44 more interesting (to me) is where is bottom in  gold stocks?  They aren't highly correlated in their bottoms and tops...
3789 2018-09-07 21:07:38 Profit taking in the technology space weighed on the market to begin what is historically the toughest month of the year for stocks.

3791 2018-09-07 21:07:09 @joerogan what do you think about @Tesla stocks dropping after @elonmusk hit the wood on the pod. 
3792 2018-09-07 21:07:06 We would remember, but he doesn't want to sell stocks.
3793 2018-09-07 21:06:36 Fr he lost like 9% in his stocks cuz he took 1 hit but if he only drank then I bet nothing would have changed
3794 2018-09-07 21:06:23 Buying #dogecoin is kind of like buying a stock, if the stock certificate was just a price of paper with the words “stocks are dumb” written on it.

3797 2018-09-07 21:05:32 But @KYLEUNFUG said stocks tumbled and they lost 4 million 
3798 2018-09-07 21:05:17 Also someone at high level resigning would have a lot to do with stocks which they did on Tuesday well before the weed smoking fiasco. Very underhanded piece to misrepresent
3799 2018-09-07 21:05:12 It's crazy how @elonmusk smokes a joint, and the #Tesla stock plunges. One small thing can create a big problem for investors.

3814 2018-09-07 21:03:08 @T93 Take it or leave it but imo Aug was so strong for a lot of stocks, that everyone expected it to carryover. Sept is usually bad month.

3838 2018-09-07 20:55:05 Because its likely all about tax receipts from trading stocks
3839 2018-09-07 20:54:46 The shift to classic "defensive" consumer stocks slowed Fri as tech selling abated. Fri. defensive movers:

3840 2018-09-07 20:54:20 It didn't work out so well for Dick's Sporting Goods, ESPN, CNN or other companies. NFL ratings were down again this year after a 3 year decline. Nike is all about money & they capitalize on stupid young people who are uninformed or Chinese customers who don't care. Stocks down.
3841 2018-09-07 20:53:45 Yes, but we own so little compared to the top 1%. Foreign investors own more in US stocks than the bottom 90%.
3842 2018-09-07 20:52:47 He is one of the richest people in the world lol. Majority owner of Tesla. Stocks lost 6% of the value after that video came out
3843 2018-09-07 20:52:18 Have you done any math on how stocks relates to DRPM, DRAPM, or DPIPM?
3844 2018-09-07 20:51:07 Obama’s level of jealously & narcissism is extreme & pathetic. Obama’s economy was the slowest growth in our history b/c he added to regs, taxes & outsources US jobs

President Trump deregulated, cut taxes & made deals to keep US jobs from getting outsourced. Stocks soared. #MAGA
3845 2018-09-07 20:50:58 Does anyone know what the actual price of Nike stocks are right now? Im asking for a friend.
3846 2018-09-07 20:50:55 Sales jumped, stocks did not. It was risky and time will tell how it pans out.
3847 2018-09-07 20:50:07 No mysteriously my whole Bing rebuttal disappears. Bing the truth the bullrun of stocks 9 years running. Job numbers constitent for several years before Trump. What has changed according to Bing is wage stagnation. Inflation partly from tariffs has eaten away at tax breaks.

3850 2018-09-07 20:49:36 --aannndddd his stocks are down 10 percent.
3851 2018-09-07 20:48:35 Elon Musk out here smoking, yeah that’s right, lower the value of Tesla stocks so I can buy a few please.
3852 2018-09-07 20:48:25 So if there will come a recession or a fast dipp on markets because stocks that already have risen 150% goes down fast isn’t better to have money to invest when they are lower ? Like investors did 2008 bought houses and sold them 3-5 years later..Cash if the dollar stays strong!?
3853 2018-09-07 20:48:17 He's always been a pretty mediocre stocks guy, which certainly is not the be-all, end-all, but they've been alarmingly low for a guy with his level of defensive reputation. And DRPM has never really liked him. But yeah, he's firmly my fourth guy behind Kawhi/KD/Butler.
3854 2018-09-07 20:47:40 Nike releases statement as stocks drop.."We believe Colin is one of the most inspirational athletes of this generation" Ummm no he isn't. But do you know who is an inspirational athlete of this generation? JJ Watt. He raised $41.6 million dollars for Harvey victims >>>

3860 2018-09-07 20:43:50 If you’re too scared, the market won’t give you.
If you’re too cocky or angry, the market will take from you.
If you’re prepared and composed, the market will reward you.
The market is basically trying to teach you emotional balance.

3878 2018-09-07 20:35:42 Everyone's losing their minds over @elonmusk  taking a toke and not inhaling it.. Imagine working for the guy and not expecting the pace to be this fast. 
And all I can think about it all the stocks I would buy rn if I had any kind of money.
#LoveIsTheAnswer
3879 2018-09-07 20:35:26 In my opinion, Canadian marijuana stocks are the perfect stocks to buy into. TLRY has gone up $22.50 a share to what is right now $77.30 since the beginning of August.
3880 2018-09-07 20:33:50 Wealth is a definition variable. But aside from this, wealth is not hard to achieve, all it takes is some discipline and wit. 

Save most of your income. 

Proportionally pour it into different stocks/index funds.

Diversify based on risk.

Repeat over some years.

Boom, wealthy.
3881 2018-09-07 20:33:48 how can sales go up and stocks plummet? you poor poor ignorant girl
3882 2018-09-07 20:32:49 U.S stocks slump on trade war fears between U.S and China. @POTUS threatening duties on another $267 billion in Chinese goods
3883 2018-09-07 20:32:32 And it will present a great opportunity to go long value vs growth stocks.
3884 2018-09-07 20:31:55 Tesla stocks fell bc Musk hit the blunt 
3885 2018-09-07 20:31:18 At least since 2015 when we won best performing stock exchange in the world. I know Mayberry just listed mjel as a form of index fund but you'd have to check the investment houses. I only look at stocks directly.
3886 2018-09-07 20:30:23 I ordered a pair yesterday.  I should start buying stocks in the companies trump goes after.
3887 2018-09-07 20:30:21 @elonmusk right now is higher than $tesla stocks
3888 2018-09-07 20:30:08 Ahem yeah. Should really offset the 3.9 billion they lost in stocks
3889 2018-09-07 20:30:04 Awww but there stocks when to shit!  #WWG1WGA!!!!!!!
3890 2018-09-07 20:29:49 Ok, but not understanding how style-box is limiting you in executing your strategy (or forcing you to be 100% invested). As I understand it, you're picking stocks from your own 'alpha brands consumer spending index', which spans 200 firms globally from 70 different industries.
3891 2018-09-07 20:28:53 Al Capone doesn’t have a chance. Note your 1935 slick back hair do.
3892 2018-09-07 20:28:50 Now they have a ton of silly regulations that limit certain types of firearms that led to inventions  like bump stocks which is stupidest thing ever from a practical shooting stand point but it violates no law they made.
3893 2018-09-07 20:28:40 They will tear eachother apart and Trump won't have to lift a finger to ruin either of them. They're already laughing stocks.
3894 2018-09-07 20:28:24 So stupid how stocks have fallen because @elonmusk didn’t even hit a joint properly. Yet he is coming up with a tunnel system to help traffic issues globally #JoeRogan #Tesla #ElonMusk #wishicouldinvest
3895 2018-09-07 20:27:56 Their stocks just rose 31%.  I think they’re doin’ ok
3896 2018-09-07 20:27:16 When Trump leaves Twitter they are going to wish they had been nicer to us as their stocks plummet

3898 2018-09-07 20:26:09 It just took a fat crash and is still priced at over 6k people don’t talk about it because no one cares - it’s stocks. Everyone who did talk about it probably bought some then sold it the next day for $10 profit and can’t believe y’all do that 9-5 shit.

3902 2018-09-07 20:24:41 I know there are no independent studies.
It’s really simple. Homelessness is here because ACLU won the cases banning confinement of adults without court order. Reagan cut funding of the EMPTY mental institutions.
Solve how you can ban bump stocks and have no loopholes.

3907 2018-09-07 20:22:53 As another non-fin, my position is if you don't have knowledge or time to at least skim through financial statements, you should stay out of doing anything w/ individual stocks. Definitely not w/ your retirement money. Then again, I gave up on MSM long ago.
3908 2018-09-07 20:22:21 Dude I only took two stocks lmao

3910 2018-09-07 20:21:52 "Tesla stock tanks as much as 9%" after @elonmusk smoked on @joerogan. That public appearance dropped market share. Sounds like I need to invest in @Tesla ASAP. Why?? because everyone is talking Elon and it looks like stocks are cheap
3911 2018-09-07 20:21:03 I’d second this. Use Adams code and you both get £10. You deposit £10 or more and will instantly have the bonus to use with no wager requirements. This isn’t like betting, isn’t crypto, isn’t FPL, isn’t stocks and shares.... it’s EPIC! Add me for advice as a newbie.Happy to share
3912 2018-09-07 20:21:02 World stocks mixed to a tad lower: US -.2%; Europe +.1%.. Trade tensions with China again stoked by Trump combined with no Canada deal weighing on markets. Market direction uncertain, volatility spike certain. Short-term money safer in cash or short-term bonds. Caution advised.
3913 2018-09-07 20:20:24 You keep changing your argument. Your original comment said civilized countries, now you change it to 7 countries. Bump stocks can be used on many semi-automatic rifles. While Obama approved the sale of bump stocks most people support regulation.

3918 2018-09-07 20:19:22 The MSM, CNN, MNBC all ignored his faults & refrained from criticizing Obama unlike the treatment @realDonaldTrump is getting where the stories are 90% negative with all the great things that are happening. Lowest unemployment, 400,000 new manf jobs, ISIS, Stocks, NKO, Trade, etc
3919 2018-09-07 20:19:08 Most people want to talk about sports, music and entertainment...
While I rather talk stocks, bonds and dividends.

3920 2018-09-07 20:17:58 Don’t fear our stocks dropping. The Chinese are killing themselves in their own pollution, their land will be barren, uninhabitable, and their crops will stop growing. @FoxNews @GOP
3921 2018-09-07 20:17:57 No! I want effective and realistic solutions. The only way I know is the test the idea.
You’re saying you want to impose regardless of effectiveness.
Like banning bump stocks - loophole - manufacturers sell as pieces. Buyer buys parts and has whole bump stock.
Get it????
3922 2018-09-07 20:17:30 Idiots to shoot themselves in the foot as their competition stocks up on Nike goods for customers who don't care.  George Carlin ... "I don't get all choked up about yellow ribbons and American flags. I see them as symbols, and I leave them to the symbol-minded."

3926 2018-09-07 20:16:43 They were thinking that your low approval ratings would mean good $$ for them. And they are right. Stocks up over 30% today. Your low approval hasn't changed, fool. Even child-labor-using Nike knows #Trumpsters boycotts won't damage them.#youloseagain

3931 2018-09-07 20:16:06 Many stocks have been on fire lately and now the first week of September we have some pulling back. Maybe this is a good time to rebalance your stocks. Don't be upset of your up 25% in something and it pulls back 5%. Lesson learned - don't give back your profits.

3938 2018-09-07 20:14:45 Also anyone who knows about stocks is that dip is really minor and they can happen at any time for a major stock like Nike. They’ll be fine.
3939 2018-09-07 20:14:42 California Voters: PLEASE remember to vote NO on Prop 7, which would legalize owning stocks!

3944 2018-09-07 20:12:42 Holding perceived 'over valued' stocks is also an art, art that should be mastered to reap the full benefits.
3945 2018-09-07 20:12:09 Lol. Life today is so much tougher than the old days. Why cant we just go back to feudal times.... we had it sooo good! The lords would put me in the stocks when i didnt deliver the harvest on time. Fortunaltey most of my kids died from plaque so...less mouths to feed. #blessed
3946 2018-09-07 20:11:56 I just don’t understand why anyone would get mad at ANYONE for smoking a blunt, these stupid investors pulling their stocks from Tesla are stupid, Elon wasn’t doing anything at all, dint harm anyone he was just enjoying talking in a podcast, people these days I swear
3947 2018-09-07 20:11:47 Stocks always vary, and I’m sure all of this publicity will help it shoot back up. From what I’ve read, he is very controversial. It may have just turned the employees off. It’s common for very intelligent people to be poor at communicating, because they’re very straightforward.

Everyone is going to be friends again. Your aunt is going to call herself QueenofCrypto on Twitter and have more followers than you, and the rocket emoji stocks will ATH

3974 2018-09-07 20:02:46 Agree, but as the example shows - some of our stocks might not be as valuable as we think.
3975 2018-09-07 20:01:53 wow, i literally did this last week, but none of the homies did it, so i didn’t get any free stocks. you might get a few.
3976 2018-09-07 20:01:08 And the day the stocks went down 3%, other similar sporting good companies went down even more. It was a down day for the market.
3977 2018-09-07 20:01:05 Lmao I love Nike so much. All these uneducated hillbillies making unintentionally hilarious poorly edited and not very well thought out videos thinking they're actually going to make the slightest dent in Nike's stocks and business. This is what americas all about

3987 2018-09-07 19:57:50 Poverty is trending downward. Wealth is trending upward. Unemployment is down, stocks are up. Equality of opportunity has never been greater. So what exactly is the greater cause which is so urgent?
3988 2018-09-07 19:57:47 Amazing how Elon Musk actions are affecting severely small investors who bought Tesla stocks. It’s bumpy ride of Tesla stock in 2018. Even if your system is effective and efficient you still need strong and stable leadership to drive company further.

Based on FA alone can pick stocks to be successful in swing trades. Learning TA now to get into day trading.
3995 2018-09-07 19:55:48 They chased all of our type out of stocks, out of bonds and into gold. And I just thought gold would be a place for us to wait. But they fire bomb it. And the gold stocks have always loosely followed the business/credit cycle. Until now of course. Worst bear wipeout of any market

4017 2018-09-07 19:44:41 A few reasons why I like home building stocks #ITB

1.  People still scarred from 08' and are valuing home builders as such.

2.  >20% off their ATH.  Trend up

3.  Relatively cheap from multiple valuation metrics

4.  Structural tailwind.  Shortage of affordable homes.
4018 2018-09-07 19:44:32 yeah who needs stocks anyways
4019 2018-09-07 19:43:40 Yes as completely tax free. Can’t hold overseas investments but pretty much anything else. I hold some US stocks in a “regular” share dealing account

4047 2018-09-07 19:35:57 tesla man said fuck stocks
4048 2018-09-07 19:35:49 #WallStreet's major indexes moved lower on Friday after U.S. President #DonaldTrump said he had #tariffs ready to impose on an additional $267 billion worth of #Chinese imports, though stocks pared losses late in the afternoon.
4049 2018-09-07 19:35:25 I really like to swath it

4052 2018-09-07 19:35:03 DEFINITELY not your doing Trump. Don't take credit where credit is not due. This bull market started in 2009. Anyone who trades stocks gets it and you had zero to do with it, it's all technicals of Elliott Wave 3 Theory. Even Obama can't take credit so beat it already.
4053 2018-09-07 19:34:49 @realDonaldTrump We are all laughing here in the U.K., yes laughing, a terrible thing. You are a symptom lol. You crashed all the tech stocks. You now have colonel mustard in your office. Hahaha.
4054 2018-09-07 19:34:11 Stocks went up 11,000 under Obama. Mic drop.

4066 2018-09-07 19:30:24 Tencent’s chart is better IMO with the momentum divergence and RSI didn’t hit oversold (yet) on the retest of the low but with $467B potential additional tariffs Chinese stocks have room to the downside IMO
4067 2018-09-07 19:30:22 These panicking moronic sellers just got me a sweet deal to double my #Tesla shares. These guys aren't even paying attention to the hot sales lately, lol. I'll double-down again if it heads to Goldman's target. Stocks = making money getting it cheap when people panic

4070 2018-09-07 19:30:00 Use better Russia with its extensive land where no one will even think to reach you and look for your door, no nuclear can cover its vast territory  at least you can go out to see the sun while your stocks last. Or consider Canada or Danish Greenland at least, much closer
4071 2018-09-07 19:29:52 It’s great @elonmusk smoked weed with @joerogan. It’s fucking stupid stocks drop from this. It’s 2018 not 1918
4072 2018-09-07 19:27:48 He should stop monkeying around
4073 2018-09-07 19:27:38 Invested in some good ole Canadian marijuana stocks today
4074 2018-09-07 19:27:23 Don’t buy Tesla stock just because you love the product. It’s scarily high, and pretty risky. I use @AJBellYouinvest platform, fairly priced and good features. Start with a stocks & shares ISA.
4075 2018-09-07 19:26:46 Nike stocks all gone! I cannot support an American company, with products made in Asia, supporting a cop hater and insurrectionist! If they have the lunacy to turn on their customers and support anti=Police demonstrations, then I don't support them!" Burn them Nikes!"

Homeless person pays me 50 cents for a cigarette. If he'd just save $5 he could buy a 20 pack and sell them to others for 50 cents, a 100% ROE.

If he opens a bank with $250 and keeps it there for 6 months they'll pay him $150 dollars, a 60% ROE.

4079 2018-09-07 19:25:10 I don't think they're fooling anyone, because Tesla's stocks are plummeting. No one thinks what Elon Musk is doing is smart, including people that are explicitly for the legalization of Marijuana. At least not that I've seen.
4080 2018-09-07 19:24:01 Day after they announced Kap and stocks plunged. Kap lovers. “No one should react to anything based on a one day sample size” Kap lovers after ONE day after his commercial airs “SEE I TOLD YOU NIKE IS GENIUS KAP IS MY HERO!”
4081 2018-09-07 19:23:33 Guy with stock in Tesla "OH FUCK THIS DUDE'S SMOKING WEED HE'S NOT FIT TO TAKE CARE OF OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY I NEED TO SELL MY STOCKS!"

4089 2018-09-07 19:21:47 Great because I have a weekly gain of 1% with this weak market all week. And even having some horrible trades like $RH $DOCU . But other great stocks in my portfolio : $TNDM $FNKO $COUP $SENS $PSTG $TWLO $PVTL . How do you see $SENS @traderstewie @TMLTrader ??
4090 2018-09-07 19:21:14 Man is a maverick. 

This latest trending might be coz of the weed he smoked live causing Tasla's stocks to tumble ati since the boss violated the company's code of conduct.
4091 2018-09-07 19:21:03 @joerogan  you fucked up my Money stocks are down
4092 2018-09-07 19:19:47 Nike’s stocks are still doing great sooooooo
4093 2018-09-07 19:19:43 Haha their stocks went back up!! @Nike was thinking about Americans!! Unlike you who only thinks of yourself!  Oh lol burning Nike stuff how about if you don’t want it Donate it to our Vets/Homeless & Fed workers who now won’t get a raise because of you!!I Stand With Kaepernick!
4094 2018-09-07 19:19:07 His stocks plunged because he’s become increasingly erratic. Smoking pot just adds to the nuttiness.
4095 2018-09-07 19:18:10 LOL can't believe people quit cause Elon smoked. wtf is wrong with people. Great time to buy Tesla stocks btw if they are still low

4101 2018-09-07 19:16:14 Talk about paranoia....have ya watched the left being so unhinged?  Everyone is a racist, commie, nazi, xenophobe, Trump will cause WWIII, Stocks will fall, on and on and on.  Oh. Women will die if we get a scotus pick.  But Republicans are the paranoid ones. Uh huh.
4102 2018-09-07 19:15:26 Stocks are up again today and sales are up.
4103 2018-09-07 19:15:21 pot stocks mooning, short the squares
4104 2018-09-07 19:15:11 Some fear is building up in the speculative option positions after 5-6 days of volatility in US stocks. Breadth on NYSE is very oversold now, we may see a short squeeze next week. It's still a bull market, but for short term, S&P 500 Index needs to remain over 2864 to rally. $SPX
4105 2018-09-07 19:14:02 Are your trying to say these are like Dotcom bubble stocks? because only two of these trade at 100x + while the rest are cheap compared to bubble era and not insanely priced . The cashflows and profits are insane except for one vs dotcom era stocks which produced hopium.
4106 2018-09-07 19:13:29 Wait until the old white men stockholders die and the next generation inherits the stocks. I'm hoping things will not be so skewed. but then again we have Ben Shapiros and Stephen Millers in this world. who knows?
4107 2018-09-07 19:13:16 It is odd; holding 4 Chinese stocks today.... all green. When this is resolved, expecting an explosion there.
4108 2018-09-07 19:12:56 Your stocks went up? Paid for by corporate welfare which is paid for by US through taxes and debt.
4109 2018-09-07 19:12:22 People talk about trade wars are bad well ok for them but not the rest of us who dont own big co.or huge amt.of stocks in china ect.the majority of us will be better off without a defaceit in out country.the people paid off by china ect.are just that paid off to screw America

4111 2018-09-07 19:12:09 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
4112 2018-09-07 19:12:09 I've ignored/avoided all the weed stocks $CRON $TLRY $CGC this week, not a single trade, was way easier money to be made on other tickers, but I'll definitely be on them again when the timing feels right.
4113 2018-09-07 19:11:11 “Marijuana stocks now in the green” don’t think we didn’t catch that @juleshyman
4114 2018-09-07 19:10:35 That's the bankers crushing out the bears for the end of the week. You bet they are buying stocks like crazy. Nasdaq has pared virtually all of their losses. Amazing.
4115 2018-09-07 19:10:31 I don't trade. I have the worst timing in the world. I bought my first dow stocks in September 2008. Weeks before the crisis. Lost 90% trying to buy into gold stocks since 2013. Friend happend to pay me $3000 in Bitcoin right at the first $1000 peak. Sold at $200
4116 2018-09-07 19:10:17 He is pretty much regular person who doesn't care about stocks and media the same as we don't. Thanks.

4118 2018-09-07 19:08:42 Good I'm doing the same but I play in stocks since Nov 2016 and made a lot of money because of Trump and his policies! Markets has made some corrections this year as long as policies are good and Canada and US trade are making progress

4123 2018-09-07 19:06:29 Unable to respond with intelligence and compassion? If u did, you might be accepted by the intelligent, compassionate people around you . If “a great job”, means making you & your country laughing stocks and ironic “jokes”,you are right. For the world’s sake, Leave.
4124 2018-09-07 19:05:57 Hypocrisy is at its best now a days. #tesla stocks drop because @elonmusk smokes a joint. Really? These same ppl who are selling are probably doing so while drinking their gin and juice. Pot is legal in CA.
4125 2018-09-07 19:05:47 SEC needs to investigate. See if someone is shorting these stocks before news breaks.
4126 2018-09-07 19:05:44 Wow @Tesla stocks dropped 10% because of Elon’s interview with @joerogan last night. Insanity.
4127 2018-09-07 19:05:17 @elonmusk don’t let all this noise and stocks get you down. We love you we thank you for taking on the challenges of the world. It’s not easy being Elon Musk. Don’t let the hypocrites bring you down. Weed is nothing. Love ya buddy keep your head up!
4128 2018-09-07 19:04:24 Wasn't referring to the hse mkt specifically. The Market (stocks) generally.
4129 2018-09-07 19:03:30 My stocks are doing very well thank you- since Obama left the whole portfolio has been steadily climbing.
4130 2018-09-07 19:03:28 $TSLA stocks dropped from this lol
4131 2018-09-07 19:03:10 "Diversification is very important... don’t put all your eggs on Tesla, buy some marijuana stocks too." $TSLA #CryptoIsOfficiallyDead
4132 2018-09-07 19:03:00 probably. unlike other stocks where Trump scared off more weak-willed investors and prices dipped briefly ($AMZN), a consumer brand like Nike doesn’t have any immediate impact. i expect sales to go up.
4133 2018-09-07 19:02:58 Small interjection, but stocks being up 6000 points is heavily due to stock buy backs. Most mega corps. used their tax break to buy back stock to inflate the price. Why? CEOs and others at the top are heavily invested in stock, they cash out and pay less in taxes due to tax scam.
4134 2018-09-07 19:02:19 it didn’t tho stocks went down 9% but hey i think is pretty cool elon took a hit
4135 2018-09-07 19:01:38 put it all into pot stocks
4136 2018-09-07 19:01:34 Customer confidence on the upswing, that alone, should carry stocks index a few more notches; and if another tax break for the expendable level comes around, re-invest in WS.  That should be a given.
4137 2018-09-07 19:01:26 Remember Quantitative Easing by the Fed?  That was Obama's way of creating economic growth... $10+ trillion of debt dumped on taxpayers so big banks could pay off their losses and use rest to manipulate stocks for HUGE profit$.
They still have trillions of risky credit derivs
4138 2018-09-07 19:01:09 Stocks are up 6000 points because the rich got the tax break and put more money into the market for themselves. My pay did NOT go up AT ALL!!! But the CEO, CFO and VP where I work, all rewarded themselves with family vacations for 3 weeks at a "company retreat"
4139 2018-09-07 19:00:07 Un peu de "fondamentaux ": S&P : les gains des stocks FAANGM ( Amazon, Apple,Facebook, Google,Netflix) totalisent à eux seuls un gain de 30% sur l' année. Si on soustrait ces stocks du S&P, la performance des 494 restand  n' est plus que de + 3%. Know your history...pas très sain
4140 2018-09-07 19:00:05 $TLRY shorted at 92 ....still one of the most overpriced stocks ever!.....20 mill in sales...6 billion mark cap?..joker bulls

4143 2018-09-07 18:59:10 Seriously, why even listen to what marx/engels? Both absolute degenerates. Marx begged/borrowed to maintain the bourgeoisie lifestyle he grew up with while engels spent his time whoring. Marx died owning stocks! Both were drunks. Theres drunk hobo on my corner tjust as sensical!
4144 2018-09-07 18:58:51 I'm not even sure what your arguing on, there's more job creation due to it but if some companies feel the best way forward is to buy stocks or remain small as a way to stay competitive then they stand a chance of being beaten by those that grow given the chance
4145 2018-09-07 18:58:23 Blessed to see another bday.  Stocks actually up some today and nobody starting unnecessary drama. Today is a good day #IceCubeVoice
4146 2018-09-07 18:56:33 Nope not at all. I don’t give a rats arse whether he did or didn’t and doubt anyone else does either.The tank in stocks is more to do with people realising what kind of person he is. He drug tests his staff, but it’s ok for him to do it because rules don’t apply when you’re rich
4147 2018-09-07 18:56:13 The store not the publicly traded $BONTQ as there is a big difference with BK stocks. The creditors sold the assets off but the new co and court hasnt stated anything about the PUBCO being bought or transferred which means it's not part of the deal!

4150 2018-09-07 18:55:37 What you hear:
“Stocks are overvalued”

What they’re really saying:
“The consensus struck from 60,000 trades representing over $400B in wealth that occur daily have mispriced stocks in a way that I myself can clearly figure out”

-Or-

“Wanna hear something insanely hubristic?”
4151 2018-09-07 18:55:14 I usually avoided new stocks, they usually have early investors looking to cash out and it tanks.  Depends on lock up period and what price thier shares are at. Cweb has 7.00 cheapies.... and I couldn’t find info on earlier rounds so avoided it
4152 2018-09-07 18:55:06 Tesla stocks are down as much as 9% because of him smoking. I wouldn’t call that normalized.
4153 2018-09-07 18:54:45 So Marijuana stocks are booming, but the ceo of tesla takes a draw of a joint and their stock dips. Kind if ironic.
4154 2018-09-07 18:54:12 His tweets,and that too Tesla stocks have been affected badly
4155 2018-09-07 18:54:03 Le stock de sécurité sur Casa chez le centre régional de transfusion est en général entre 2 et 3 jours.

4156 2018-09-07 18:52:45 Right. I tend to see the savings / investment process as one that is disturbed by the introduction of housing. Buy a home to live in. Use stocks and bonds to invest. Minimize randomness. :)
4157 2018-09-07 18:52:06 Blame Obama or should we get congress to sell their big pharma stocks and make them regulate them so they stop gouging us with unexplainable costs? Insurance companies, pharmaceuticals are to blame not Obama. FFS.
4158 2018-09-07 18:52:02 Why I sold my shares months ago.  Place in other stocks that are up 14% in one month.
4159 2018-09-07 18:51:57 Tesla stocks really going down because Elon took one hit of a blunt and drank whiskey on JRE. I can’t deal with people anymore.

4168 2018-09-07 18:48:31 Out of all of the substance and ideas @elonmusk shared with joe rogan, stocks fall and social media is in a frenzy over ONE puff of a blunt in a state where marijuana is legal. A true testament to the societal misunderstanding of cannabis and negative bias.
4169 2018-09-07 18:48:24 I got English for free growing up in a bilingual household. If I had a krona for every time someone said, "You're so good at English! You must be so good at languages" I'd have bought stocks in Google with it or something.

4172 2018-09-07 18:47:18 Market quarterly cycles only exist off stocks that are earnings based. Crypto does not have that.

Saying crypto is going up because the fourth quarter has always been good is just as blind as betting on a pump.
4173 2018-09-07 18:47:00 Many investors know the importance of looking at a mutual fund’s “expense ratio”.

Question:  When a fund trades stocks in the fund, who pays the transaction costs for those trades?

Hint:  The expense ratio is not the only fund fee you’re paying.
4174 2018-09-07 18:46:52 After losing $3.6bil in stocks, they need it! LOL!!!
4175 2018-09-07 18:46:41 It allowed me to get some stocks on sale. Woot!  The noise I am hearing is more about the Chief Accounting officer leaving. But really, if he was brought on to bring them private, it's understandable why he would leave.
4176 2018-09-07 18:46:32 .@ChildersRadio Why do we let the SEC regulate stocks? Isn't being the premiere collegiate football conference in the USA enough?
4177 2018-09-07 18:45:52 Yes, can you find another company that can supply Chitty Chitty Bang Bang DVD ? Not from DVD Over Stocks though.

4188 2018-09-07 18:42:15 I hated this guy, but that doesn't mean I didn't respect him. Oh, and he never took any of my guns, or tried to ban my bump stocks. I'm glaring at you, @realDonaldTrump .

4190 2018-09-07 18:41:08 I actually agree with you that $AOI is extremely undervalued :)

4197 2018-09-07 18:38:56 There's much more to knowing the trend than seeing whether stocks closed in positive or negative territory on any given day. It usually pays to "look under the hood" of the stock market a little deeper.
4198 2018-09-07 18:38:41 One regulator is so caring about retail that he uses all kinds of hurdles to shoo them away from from direct eq investing....

4209 2018-09-07 18:36:18 Stocks have nothing to do with morality it’s a few people trying to sell off there stock so they can re buy it at a lower price to make a quick profit off of the other idiots who think this is a big deal... Buy Tesla stock now this was the best business decision Elon ever made

I've already decided to pat him+
4213 2018-09-07 18:34:10 #Tesla stocks didn't drop because #ElonMusk smoked weed on the tiresome Joe Rogan 'Experience'. If anything, they dropped because Musk is an increasingly unhinged PR disaster. It's not about weed, it's about baseless claims that a hero fucks twelve-year-old Thai girls.
4214 2018-09-07 18:34:10 Pbay don't fire me up... I'll come blow up all your stocks . I got the power and knowledge ...

4220 2018-09-07 18:33:32 When scanning for stocks with volume - sort them by Industry/Sector. 

This helps you see patterns and rotation.
4221 2018-09-07 18:33:12 it does not mean Trump did not help, he helped the stock market but all big corps knew huge tax cuts were coming, and who owns stocks? 90% owned by the 1%. Take each individual issue/accomplishment instead of a blanket over everything.
4222 2018-09-07 18:32:50 I can’t believe this would make someone to sell stocks. I also can’t help myself, but it seems to me that media are just full of haters.

4233 2018-09-07 18:30:18 Make it harder to get guns. Register all guns and gun owners. Make it an offense not to report stolen guns. Ban bump stocks. Toughen up gun offense laws. Close the Charleston loophole.

4238 2018-09-07 18:29:59 Attention college students
You are not drinking enough beer.
I have lost $40 in a month on big beer stocks and this is simply not ok.
This weekend I challenge all of you: do better, because this showing is pathetic. Thank you and have a great day.
4239 2018-09-07 18:29:33 We see our so called justice system at work all the time. Tommy sent down on a criminal charge for something that not classed as criminal and not inside 4 hours anyway. Then the very next day a muss rapes a young girl but is let off due to wife can't talk English. Laughing stocks
4240 2018-09-07 18:29:27 I did join. Didn't get any explanation. Only a list of unlisted stocks and their prices. Nothing else.
4241 2018-09-07 18:29:14 Signs of an unhealthy market: FAANGM stocks up 30% YTD, the S&P 494 up 3%. Over half the 2018 gains came from six stocks. Historians know what that means.
4242 2018-09-07 18:28:59 I’m not sure you understand. He’s selling stocks and borrowing money to raise funds to sustain the business. This type of activity puts the shareholders at risk of losing value. What the shareholders need to know is if he’s of sound mind. Smoking drugs doesn’t help the perception
4243 2018-09-07 18:28:59 Ever notice how our stocks were sliding yesterday and the day before? Ever notice this past January -666 stock market crash? Ever notice the white supremacists running for office as Republicans?
4244 2018-09-07 18:28:45 Some people may not like what Nike is doing, but they definitely know what they’re doing. Take a look at their sales and stocks the last few days. 
4245 2018-09-07 18:27:50 Op ed a hoax. His cabinet alone has enough brain power and influence to have 25th if it were true. Inner circle on board for sure. It's a hoax to distract. Amoroso! Kavanaugh? Bump stocks?
4246 2018-09-07 18:27:20 buying which stocks?
4247 2018-09-07 18:26:20 Lol, seriously? 

Seeing as our stocks last for 2-4 years I won’t be panicking. 
4248 2018-09-07 18:26:19 Tesla stocks are going to reach an all time high when they rise 420% by next week it's time to buy NOW
4249 2018-09-07 18:26:18 People are mad because Elon Musk took one toke of weed on a podcast? Grow the fuck up, smh. Stocks down 9%, im sure he still doesn't give a fuck lmao
4250 2018-09-07 18:26:08 Hey Fam, you're not too young to start trading and buying stocks
4251 2018-09-07 18:25:47 So after educating myself on the "markets", I decided to wait this out in gold. Started buying when I was 24. 10 years later, housing & stocks are way worse, & I can barely sell any of my gold for what I paid for it. This financial system has deprived my life of meaning.
4252 2018-09-07 18:25:37 Crashed the stocks bc of publicly smoking then itll go up a nice percentage by Monday. Flipping his own money. Elon musk is Darth Vader of earth.

4260 2018-09-07 18:23:32 Someone highlighted to me the other day that one of the stocks I invested 4 years ago in Wire Card AG trades now at 70x earnings and it may be a good idea to sell it. 

Reading about True Potential now, I may change my mind and hold onto it.

4263 2018-09-07 18:23:15 Tesla stocks dropping because Elon Musk smoked weed tells you everything you need to know about the mentality of shareholders.

Stop maybe corporate decisions to appease these people. They are out of touch and generally have dumb opinions.
4264 2018-09-07 18:23:12 No, because unlike trading in stocks the Spot market is Physical #uranium which has delivery time and location included in the Bids and Asks.  Buyers and sellers are at mismatched locations so no deals being made until buyers find a seller willing to deliver to Cameco site.

4267 2018-09-07 18:22:51 I'm seriously asking, not trolling.
I don’t understand the connection between your first proposition ("You:…") and your second prop ("Also you, probably:…") - do you mean that the COMPANY's worth in stocks is the same thing as the CEO's salary?
4268 2018-09-07 18:22:38 @Cucker_Tarlson And to be clear, I wouldn't buy this stock with your money. Not even when it hits $5 bc I have a rule never buy stocks  <10
4269 2018-09-07 18:22:32 Employment numbers took stocks down and bonds, too. With more than a handle down in the bonds, it seems like an overreaction, even if I favor the short side.  This is a very long weekend for Jews as the New Year falls from Sunday night through Tuesday evening. Expect the unusual.
4270 2018-09-07 18:22:24 DOES ANYONE KNOW IF THE SAEM KR WILL HAVE STOCKS OF SVT PERFUME OR IT IS ONLY FOR PRE ORDER?
4271 2018-09-07 18:22:03 @OptionsAction  What are your thoughts on using LEAPS for risk reversals as a way to participate in the long term upside of stocks in smaller accounts that can't accommodate multiple round lots?
4272 2018-09-07 18:21:51 And why not give data on CEO pay going up in the same time period? Not to mention how much ( trillions) giving unfunded tax cuts ( a cost not a savings put on federal deficit credit card bill ) to corporations making record profits to buy back own stocks will cost our children?
4273 2018-09-07 18:21:41 The adults will be back at their trading desks on Monday. Summer is over. Look forward to seeing their behavior and if they come in buying stocks or selling them. My bet is the former. We’ll see...
4274 2018-09-07 18:21:16 I had ideas of being the wealthy barber type. Just work hard. Have some blue chip dividend stocks. Maybe some rental properties. But the housing bubble made it so I can barely own a house to even live in. & I am competing with the Swiss Natl Bank for  dividends -->
4275 2018-09-07 18:21:15 Global Stocks Slide On Tariff, Payrolls Suspense; Dollar Drops
 
Global markets slumped - headed for their worst week since March - in suspense over today's main events, as investors awaited the latest move in the U.S.-China trade war, while August payrolls data loomed.
4276 2018-09-07 18:19:56 I completely see where you're coming from it's just that when people are dying especially children I have to concede. They'll never regulate all guns. There needs to be some common sense. The whole printed gun thing is an obvious over step. As well as bump stocks.
4277 2018-09-07 18:19:40 I don't know. 

@michaelsantoli used to tell me "specialty retail is where love goes to die". I'd tease him bc that doesn't totally make sense, just in terms of being words, but the idea is solid. I think he meant these aren't stocks you hold forever.

Who's left to buy dips?
4278 2018-09-07 18:19:12 This is  terry, reporting on behalf of  BBC with your local business news. The Politics Advocates are pushing legislation that could impact the future shares of  MNST stocks. Thank you for tuning into  BBC.
4279 2018-09-07 18:18:58 I'm in the uk and even I can see how bad things are, trumps using jobs and stocks as a smoke screen so people don't notice the things he's not saying. He's bankrupted business before now hrs doing it to a country with tax cuts & trade wars. He's spending more than comes in
4280 2018-09-07 18:18:07 Tariffs on China?? have got soft . All republicans start the selling of stocks , shorting heavy!

4285 2018-09-07 18:16:44 INCLUSIVE: when conservative voices arent banned frm colleges & social media.
FAIR: when msm covers positive news: record low unemp & high stocks
JUST: when one deletes 33k classified emails after fed subpoena & destroys 13 devices w/ hammer faces penalty despite their last name.
4286 2018-09-07 18:15:56 @ClayTravis you can’t argue stocks anymore with these folks.  You’ll need concrete sales numbers at the end of Q3 and definitely the upcoming holiday sales.
4287 2018-09-07 18:15:32 I have a few: but I don't have NRA funds. Bump stocks, assault rifles, bkgrnd checks - NO felons, waiting period.
4288 2018-09-07 18:15:32 Stocks Cycle Downward Right On Schedule
 
September of the 2nd year of the Presidential Cycle is historically the weakest month of the 4-year cycle.
4289 2018-09-07 18:15:31 Stocks fell because of resignations not his smoking and/or drinking. A slew of executives have left in the past several years.
4290 2018-09-07 18:15:26 I am NOT a fan of his policies. Not even getting into quantative easing 1,2,3 or 4. But printing money ($4T) to buy stocks 4 times to pump up the stock market to keep bonds low as a way to manage interest rates added over $4T to our debt. It devalued the dollar immensely!
4291 2018-09-07 18:15:18 U have become a lying POS just like Trump! Tell the truth! Cuz of u gutless Republicans Tax Bill, we are headed 4 a recession! Where’s the wage growth, under Trump?

4310 2018-09-07 18:08:49 Tesla stocks drops 420%
4311 2018-09-07 18:08:43 No. The stock plunged because the CFO quit after a month on the job.

Who gives a fuck if Elon Musk enjoys some marijuana every so often? Do stocks plunge whenever a CEO is seen drinking a beer?
4312 2018-09-07 18:07:43 If you had REAL money, you wouldn't be taking stock tips from UBER drivers. Lets just make that clear. Joe Fraud, nothing more! Let me guess, you have 5M shares, hasn't traded that all year, but you loaded up! Just like all rest of your Junk penny stocks. Real stocks, learn them!

4316 2018-09-07 18:06:47 Hmm. It IS crazy times . Unemployment at record lows, GDP& job growth every month, new trade deals,hostages freed,bad regulations gone,company money brought back to US,wages rising and stocks given to employees,US embassy in Jerusalem , Russians kicked out,possible peace w/NKorea
4317 2018-09-07 18:06:09 Ehhh Musk smoking wasn’t 100% why, 2 Tesla executives left this week, it’s also currently one of the most shorted stocks on the street, investors are looking for an excuse to sell and Musks recent behavior isn’t helping, I think if Tim Cook smoked Apple wouldn’t drop as violently
4318 2018-09-07 18:06:02 Stocks isn't household wealth.

4324 2018-09-07 18:03:37 Someone who knows stocks, is buying Tesla rn a smart idea
4325 2018-09-07 18:02:28 There is sense in that, for me the single issue about the EU is lack of democracy and how they are overly influenced by lobbyists and an ideology they don’t have a mandate for. Having said that I never imagined it would become the farce it is. Blue pports and medicine stocks !
4326 2018-09-07 18:02:17 New trading plan for these cheapie crap stocks, hear words SEC investigation, short!  $OPK $RIOT
4327 2018-09-07 18:02:03 Now, what about NIKE & Kaepernick? -- I'm guessing Chinese infuence or some other anti-American stock holder/s may be involved.  If China owns a lot of Nike stock, could be yet another way 4 China to foment problems in USA...or get stocks lower 4 poss. takeover.
4328 2018-09-07 18:01:54 How do I buy tesla stocks
4329 2018-09-07 18:01:39 Reference Kaepernick and Nike!  Wise advice - sell your stocks and never buy Nike again!  They are both CURSED!
4330 2018-09-07 18:01:37 Lmao u do know even though Nike stocks have fallen they’re still up 28 % overall for the year 
4331 2018-09-07 18:00:52 tesla stocks went down 8% cus elon musk hit the blunt but didnt even inhale, aight
4332 2018-09-07 18:00:12 An end trade with china,,then Chinese stocks rally.
4333 2018-09-07 18:00:11 The stocks will rise so high that they will be higher than elon musk smoking a joint in one of his rockets.
4334 2018-09-07 17:59:23 Elon Musk knows exactly what he’s doing.
Tesla stocks plummet, and he’ll buy them all back.....cheap.
Doesn’t take a genius to figure that out. 

#ElonMusk #Tesla @elonmusk @Tesla
4335 2018-09-07 17:57:44 Ahhh, we have the stocks ready for them if you did
4336 2018-09-07 17:57:15 He sucks at public speaking in general. Oh and stocks down 7% lol
4337 2018-09-07 17:57:00 What's holding up in this Trump-tariff-induced selling panic? Cannabis and uranium stocks. Oh yeah.
4338 2018-09-07 17:56:46 Stocks go up and down! They have plummeted many times since trump took office! Stocks are not how you gage how well the president is doing they are not stable!
4339 2018-09-07 17:56:42 That said I would be easing off some RBOB bull here and hope stupid. Debate will rage on supply disruption vs demand disruption vs Bayway vs high stocks - yada yada.

4344 2018-09-07 17:55:00 Tesla stock has already been weird since all of Elon’s controversial decisions but last night after smoking a blunt on joe organs podcast... his stocks took a mean pull back . Still best ceo in the world tho.
4345 2018-09-07 17:53:52 In Asia stocks finish with losing streak due to uncertainty in trade jabs between U.S and China 
4346 2018-09-07 17:53:42 Technology would be the last place I would put my money right now. NASDAQ and FANG stocks are due for a major correction before year's end.
4347 2018-09-07 17:53:40 Short $FEZ and go bargain hunting in small-caps.  That should bring back memories of the HF days!  Find playing spread between idiosyncratic #stocks risk and macro index risk is always worth it on a risk-adjusted basis

4353 2018-09-07 17:50:33 President Trump readies another $267B in tariffs on China, starts trade negotiations with Japan. Stocks decline.
4354 2018-09-07 17:50:11 Curious: are there actually investors out there who regularly "reduce exposure" to stocks and rotate their investments based on ultra-short-term indicators and does it lead to a return better than the index?
4355 2018-09-07 17:50:03 $FB $TSLA $BABA $INTC $OSTK $TWTR Are all broken stocks for different reasons... I wouldn't touch them
4356 2018-09-07 17:49:36 tesla stocks are probably gonna rise even more after this one event i promise you
4357 2018-09-07 17:49:32 TSLA trending down since Aug 7th while pot stocks are up. 
MSM still mad at Elon.
4358 2018-09-07 17:49:06 It’s the result of the Federal Reserve and the Soros-run Treasury printing money and propping-up stocks with it. Has nothing to do with the president.
4359 2018-09-07 17:48:54 Nike stocks drop after an ad campaign. Tesla drops after the CEO smokes a blunt on a podcast. Every company is pulling Kanye’s right now

4364 2018-09-07 17:47:29 I always wondered if there's a period that makes more sense than others when checking about good areas to be invested, as in... 3 months, or 6 or 12? Would you go with 3m for this kind of comparisons?

And would it be the same for stocks, or better to use a different period?
4365 2018-09-07 17:47:07 Yes only democrats own stocks.  Since we are talking about the rich, I imagine you were for the capping of the SALT deduction?

4371 2018-09-07 17:46:32 U stocks will prob bleed until spot price makes the next strong move up. Fundamentally positive news not doing the trick. In the meantime, I’m overjoyed to be able to add at these prices 
4372 2018-09-07 17:46:26 Bearish is bullish! Kinda meta, but people shorting is the true believers. They just want those stocks cheap and reap the benefits later. Go Elon!
4373 2018-09-07 17:46:02 Ah, I see now. And no, I don’t have a subscription. So wouldn’t the argument be that Amazon stock has fared so well compared to the rest of the market that it has more future value than other stocks?
4374 2018-09-07 17:45:58 US Stocks-Wall St drops after pretty much everything else that happened this week which had nothing to do with it.
4375 2018-09-07 17:45:56 None.  Dividend growth stocks, ideally dividend aristocrats.  Emerging markets is in a liquidity crisis which may last for a while.  Tech is too expensive (overbought).  Cash loses money due to inflation.
4376 2018-09-07 17:45:27 Elon musk smoked a blunt with Joe Rogan and stocks went down.

4389 2018-09-07 17:43:07 Global, which means money can be placed elsewhere and easily depreciate your stocks worth. And the end of the day nike gets the bread and you take a L even when they get rich which is why so many american investors don’t invest in nike

4392 2018-09-07 17:42:27 There were two types of stocks known, First which makes Higher Highs OR second which makes lower lows. Today I found the third type, which makes Higher Highs AND lower lows #Tesla
4393 2018-09-07 17:42:02 How.....? U losers make everything lame, i applaud him for smoking even knowing it would take a hit on stocks...
4394 2018-09-07 17:41:31 We’re flat now, 2 years ago we were going up,not fast but evenly. Now we are economically and pay are stagnated. Market is going up because of the short term sales and re-buy back of stocks by the companies.The market will come down,when it does it will “crash”. No if’s but when.
4395 2018-09-07 17:41:06 Probably “let’s make a shit load of money” like they normally do, knowing that the only people who agree with you are a minimal portion of its consumers. Oh and their stocks are still growing.
4396 2018-09-07 17:40:36 Tesla stocks dropping 10% after Elon Musk smokes weed...looks like it’s time to buy the dip. Lol at everybody selling because of that. Please let Elon do shrooms next so I can get stock at 20% less.

4400 2018-09-07 17:39:57 How is this a loss? Stocks on sale. If you plan selling tomorrow.. sure you lost money. On the model 3 alone tesla will earn 11.5billions in revenue a year at this run rate. And the company's market cap is 50 billion. That's crazy. Tesla is the future.
4401 2018-09-07 17:39:50 no worries as long as U308 keeps going up, than the stocks will eventually play catch up.

4403 2018-09-07 17:38:34 Good, otherwise stocks would be at historical record highs, pending a 40-50% correction.

4406 2018-09-07 17:37:31 @LindseyGrahamSC it seems like you have skeletons in the closet or Trump has dirt on you! Since when did you become such a conspiracy nut? You sure have changed as of late, stocks up?
4407 2018-09-07 17:36:57 I think reflexitivity in terms of share price is relevant as well. Management receives almost all in stocks. They are like ~40% down YTD even with the business doing fine. Serious problem of managing expectations here

4414 2018-09-07 17:34:34 For all above, you look at bond market, otherwise look at earnings growth 2019, 2020? Then, look at top 5 stocks thats all
4415 2018-09-07 17:34:19 Yes I remember when i wrote my paper on my portfolio stocks that consisted of Enron, Blockbuster, Bear Sterns, and Washington Mutual. 
4416 2018-09-07 17:34:18 I hope for change. But stocks down / gold up (in dollar terms) is not that change!
4417 2018-09-07 17:34:05 I agree HC is talking an ultra conservative approach but the world is watching and a slow painful rollout will be better than the wild west approach Colorado took.  Also good for stocks knowing future is friendly even if present is pain in the a$$
4418 2018-09-07 17:33:57 I’m going to save up some money and buy some of your stocks @elonmusk not that I can make an impact but it’s something. You didn’t do anything wrong.
4419 2018-09-07 17:33:40 Now it makes sense why Tesla stocks plummeted.
4420 2018-09-07 17:33:18 Firstly, I think its consolidating very well in this monthly support zone and generally stocks tend to respect such support zones. Secondly, it offers excellent risk to reward ratio.
4421 2018-09-07 17:33:13 Elon did nothing wrong and he gave a fantastic interview. If some people want to quick sell their stocks that's fine by me. Cheaper price to acquire more lol. :)
4422 2018-09-07 17:33:06 Do you think stocks hold up if your assertion is correct Scott?
4423 2018-09-07 17:33:02 @BarackObama is the reason our economy continues an upward trajectory.  The middle, poor are actually worse off under @realDonaldTrump those with $ and stocks and corps r making money.  And those upper middle may have gotten a trickle put nothing worth much.
4424 2018-09-07 17:32:53 No but having stocks of "chemical weapons" is illegal.
4425 2018-09-07 17:32:27 My grandfather was a shoe repair legend but even he would not be able to bring those back :) Dash is long footwear stocks :)
4426 2018-09-07 17:32:15 امين
4427 2018-09-07 17:31:48 We put him on Laybuy a few months ago when our stores had their big mid year toy sales and he would have been around the equivalent of $100US which is amazing.
Im not sure who stocks them over there but at that price you wouldn’t pass him up.
4428 2018-09-07 17:31:48 i dont trade stocks but it makes a lot of sense
4429 2018-09-07 17:31:42 Tesla’s stocks dropped of 9% because Elon smoke weed durin’ an interview, you’d think that ... nvm 
4430 2018-09-07 17:31:33 Cryptohub if you want to trade in BTC and Stocks Exchange @StocksExchangeR for LTC/ETH trading. Good luck!
4431 2018-09-07 17:31:15 I have medical stocks.
4432 2018-09-07 17:30:59 el*n muskrat going thru a very public midlife crisis and his stocks plummeting is, indeed, Amusing
4433 2018-09-07 17:30:47 I love crap that is priced bellow $10, it seems that you are similar. TraderVue help me solidify what I need to focus on: Highly volatile stocks priced under $10 all the way to 12am. Then its time to leave the desk!
4434 2018-09-07 17:30:20 The fact that @tesla stock drops right after @elonmusk smokes weed is ridiculous. It just shows how uneducated the mass public is about the effects of marijuana. If he got belligerently drunk stocks wouldn't see any effects, yet alcohol is exponentially more harmful than weed.
4435 2018-09-07 17:30:08 #Stocks on roller-coaster in August with mid-month sell-off as Turkish #lira crisis triggers fears of contagion to other EMs & risks to European financial sector. Stocks recover in late August on US-Mexico trade agreement.
4436 2018-09-07 17:29:56 Still interesting why such overreaction in oil services ( HAL; SLB; PTEN and etc.)  stocks, if only infrastructure issue there. Algos?
4437 2018-09-07 17:29:54 Diuen que s’han acabat els stocks de pots de pintura groga a CAT  Estan arribant contenidors de la Xina a carrera feta... 
4438 2018-09-07 17:29:54 you mean like wet blanket of Liberalism being lifted, like better business climate, better wages, lowest unemployment in decades, people leaving welfare rolls, stocks high, ISIS hit hard, peace talks going on, out of bad deals, high optimism in country,
4439 2018-09-07 17:29:34 Yeah.. U stocks are very volatile.. one day 10% up, the next day 10% down.. you have to be able to stay cool :-)
4440 2018-09-07 17:29:18 Weekly recap. Some more mundane but just as exciting stocks to watch for me lately have been been $SQ, $OKTA, $TWLO and $TEAM. Its very gratifying to pick and hold stocks for so long and then see the returns pile up. Keep it up... #stockmarket #Stockstowatch
4441 2018-09-07 17:28:44 Well I can proudly state that 5 out of 11 stocks I own are in ASM #asm #additionalsurveillancemeasures #whyme they have still been rising so I don't care. #Mutualfunds #stocks #midcaps #smallcaps #sensex #nifty
4442 2018-09-07 17:28:43 Elon musk smokes weed and Tesla stocks drop by 7%
4443 2018-09-07 17:28:41 I need all my potheads to buy Tesla stocks ASAP
4444 2018-09-07 17:28:35 Bet yer boy has stocks in NB
4445 2018-09-07 17:26:55 $mspc stocks are cheap.  Would be a great investment for @metrospaces and/or @Etelix to buy majority of float before it kicks off.
4446 2018-09-07 17:26:43 I thought he said the stocks would tank, economy would crumble and the world would end, if Trump became President?
4447 2018-09-07 17:26:40 Glad I dont own Tesla stocks, nothing against weed, but Wall Street...

4450 2018-09-07 17:26:04 The more stocks people buy the more it will cost to buy them
4451 2018-09-07 17:26:03 I guess they trying to make more stocks for this thats why they keep pushing them. All the way to December
4452 2018-09-07 17:26:00 When working with a long timeframe, a financial advisor can suggest volatile investments that offer both greater rewards and risks. These higher reward/risk investments can include stocks, mutual funds, unit trusts, and unit investment trusts.
4453 2018-09-07 17:25:55 Here’s hoping their supplier understands the danger of the situation and stocks up 
4454 2018-09-07 17:25:29 Apparently their stocks  
4455 2018-09-07 17:25:15 Sectors w/ best 12-week momentum: #stocks
$XLU: 9% (defensive)
$XLV: 8% (defensive/growth)
$XLP: 5% (defensive)
$IYZ: 5% (defensive)

$FFTY: 0% (growth)
4456 2018-09-07 17:24:59 You're still comparing mere growth. I too believe FMCG stocks are overvalued but there is a difference between sustainable growth and two years hype growth.
4457 2018-09-07 17:24:33 Nike's stock price dipped a tiny bit. It has since recovered. And that should be "their stocks", not "there".
4458 2018-09-07 17:24:33 today's low in $TSLA tags the closing low for the year on April 2nd.
stocks have a memory.
so what happens if 252 is breached?
4459 2018-09-07 17:24:31 Oh, come on. It’s not uncommon to lose 100% of an investment! That’s why you either stick to those few stocks you know well or you may invest in “whole market” funds. Diversify or focus.
4460 2018-09-07 17:24:23 I think the Trudeau Govt will do what ever it takes to keep Pot stocks high even if it means sum’ manipulation-after all-Justin T has his own personal money invested in 1st-LP-Tweed, so we see how it works. I believe that used to be insider info or a kind of Conflict of Interest?
4461 2018-09-07 17:24:02 The reality is that all they want to dump the recommended stocks.....u cannot make money by watch CNBC....and all fake...people....never trust any anylyst buy index fund...n safe n relax.    It's difficult to beat..in the long run ...
4462 2018-09-07 17:23:26 According to @djones7861 he’ll support a man who wants to bang his own daughter so long as his stocks (I’m sure you own a TON!) are up. Stay in Oklahoma please
4463 2018-09-07 17:22:37 @PTIofficial Please ISSUE INVESTMENT BONDS or SELL STOCKS of Dams, we cannot raise 1800 billion ruppees for Dams Just by Donations,
4464 2018-09-07 17:22:32 When he come back they will put him in stocks and the prisoners will play with his bottom
4465 2018-09-07 17:22:13 That you will be gone soon and their stocks will go through the roof
4466 2018-09-07 17:21:57 Meanwhile Wall Street LOVES the pot stocks right. The hypocrisy! #tesla4000
4467 2018-09-07 17:21:49 They weren’t. Did you see how their stocks fell!!” Lol
4468 2018-09-07 17:21:25 * @elonmusk  smokes weed on stream* 

The world: "WHAT THE HELL ELON! THATS HORRIBLE!"

Stock Market: *Drops Tesla's stocks*

Me: "What the hell are you guys going on about? Its just weed calm down"
4469 2018-09-07 17:21:18 @petenajarian @jonnajarian Would you rather buy $MU stocks or options as an earnings play on Sept. 20th?
4470 2018-09-07 17:21:10 @ImranKhanPTI @Asad_Umar Please ISSUE INVESTMENT BONDS or SELL STOCKS of Dams, we cannot raise 1800 billion ruppees for Dams Just by Donations,
4471 2018-09-07 17:19:59 Start buying weed stocks people!
4472 2018-09-07 17:19:58 To be fair, the French approach, to protect stocks is the most sensible. Whilst we had the right, we didnt have the moral high ground. So a score draw!
4473 2018-09-07 17:18:49 Restaurant stocks are up because data shows solid growth in SSS but it’s lapping hurricane Harvey. Meanwhile traffic keeps declining. That’s how dumb algos are.
4474 2018-09-07 17:18:39 Tesla stocks down 9% wow
4475 2018-09-07 17:18:33 The 1 month should return far less the number of names as the 5 month.  @MarketSmith is working on correcting that as we speak. The 5 month returns confirmed stage 2 stocks. Then you can filter down from there or sort.
4476 2018-09-07 17:18:12 You realize that most of that is due to rising stock prices and that 84% of stocks are owned by the top 10% of households? 38% owned by the top 1%? Income inequality just keeps getting worse and you watch who gets taxed to pay down deficit.
4477 2018-09-07 17:17:06 Your ratings for this show just took a nose dive,kinda like Nike/ s stocks.
4478 2018-09-07 17:16:33 @Potus44 This country is BETTER since @POTUS was elected:
Lowest unemployment... EVER.... Better
Stocks at all time high.... better
Higher Wages for the middle class... Better

You have done more to divide this country than any president in history. #outnumberedOT
4479 2018-09-07 17:16:26 Elon Musk smokes weed during interview. Tesla's stocks fall as stoners' hubris rise.
4480 2018-09-07 17:16:07 “Eyy, the only thing that’s gonna sink faster than my company’s stocks is gonna be you in a pair of cement shoes. Capice?”
4481 2018-09-07 17:15:27 Stocks are trading in Mixed Territory.  NASDAQ is rebounding after several days in the Red.  MBS is dropping (down 30bps, with interest rates rising) and Yields improving to 2.94%.  DOW is down over 100 pts on news of more Tariff talk on China.
4482 2018-09-07 17:15:15 Weekly recap. Now to the interesting stuff... $MJ stocks have been obscene the last two weeks. Intraday day moves of +/- 20% in many positions I've tweeted about and held long term. There are dumpster fire stocks in the index, so caveat emptor... #stockmarket
4483 2018-09-07 17:14:23 Stocks are up 6000 pts in 1 1/2 years. More people are @ work due to removing Obama regulations. People are bringing home more $ now than under Obama. Trump has done a better job with the economy. Obama can’t blame Bush for the economy during his 1st term and take credit for this
4484 2018-09-07 17:14:19 Hi Mark: Trend Template -1 Month has 859 stock listing & 5 Months has 683 stocks. I very excited thinking  the template listed stocks with VCP's squeeze pattern( Price & Volume) 

Any possibility of incorporating VCP pattern filter in the MarketSmith screens

Thank You,
4485 2018-09-07 17:14:15 Numerco just showing uranium price went from up 10c this am to up 25c to 26.83$ meanwhile uranium stocks keep crashing.  Well I guess we have to go through some hardships to earn our islands.  Geez!!
4486 2018-09-07 17:14:07 PENNY STOCKS MOMO ALERT: $EMES - EMERGE ENERGY SERVICES LP
4487 2018-09-07 17:13:41 With shares of both homebuilders and auto manufactures plunging deeper into bear market territory, how is it possible that the U.S. economy is experiencing a record boom if stocks in these two key sectors are forecasting a recession?
4488 2018-09-07 17:13:24 ..........yeah, stocks are up, wages are up, unemployment is down, optimism is very high....... lets get rid of him.....lol
4489 2018-09-07 17:13:19 Dear Twitter- 

We're happy to share our thoughts on the #cannabis / #cannabinoid #wellness universe and we'll even  some interesting companies to inform and educate.

But please don't call our office asking about stocks.  That's O.B.

Thank you.
4490 2018-09-07 17:13:15 Tesla stocks really falling because Wall Street nerds seen a video of Elon Musk (the owner) smoking a blunt and freaked out 
4491 2018-09-07 17:12:59 Lmao...that think knocked two niggas with stocks off the roof.
4492 2018-09-07 17:12:52 Yes, I own stocks.  Trump has momentum but as his policies come into fruition the economy will turn.
4493 2018-09-07 17:12:18 im going to get my 1st lobster  sud from subway. money from my dividend stocks.
4494 2018-09-07 17:12:10 Weekly recap. A very strong previous week with net inflows of capital to stocks and new highs. Very encouraging. Noticed tech rotation to consumer staples on Wednesday, followed by a tech sell off Thursday, and stable Friday. All good signs of a strong market... #StockMarket
4495 2018-09-07 17:12:05 Like any informed investor (Booyah @jimcramer!) my portfolio began with index funds. May 2018 I began a new stocks/ETFs account. I stumbled & bumbled but learned quickly thanks to a select group of experts (@ReformedBroker!) Now I discuss my "Mad Money" plays on Twitter. Join me!
4496 2018-09-07 17:12:00 How long before Tesla dumps Elon because he's poison for their stocks?
4497 2018-09-07 17:11:48 On Economic front this government has acted real reckless. Petrol touching near Rs. 100, LTCG on stocks and MFs has nearly wiped all saving avenues. The fact is slowdown is now getting every imminent.
4498 2018-09-07 17:11:01 Are you accumulating local stocks?
4499 2018-09-07 17:10:17 #RT @RealTimeWWII: London's warehoused food stocks are burning: "There are pepper fires, loading the air with stinging particles; rum fires, barrels exploding like bombs."
4500 2018-09-07 17:10:15 Look at the stocks.... Dropping as Obama spews his BS. 
4501 2018-09-07 17:09:51 Wal-Mart is sadly one of the only places that consistently stocks new DVD and Blu-Ray releases.
4502 2018-09-07 17:09:45 @sahneydeepak sir ji what will be impact on share price of buyback psu stocks.
4503 2018-09-07 17:09:22 Tesla shares going down cuz Elon Musk hit the blunt, you think the man that co-founded Tesla, co-founded PayPal, founded SpaceX and co-founded Neuralink worries bout some stocks ?
4504 2018-09-07 17:09:17 #ElonMusk smoking #weed and the #stocks go down. So he'll #buyback with less #Cash. If #smoking didn't make him #high, going #private will surely do! <3 #Tesla
4505 2018-09-07 17:09:16 These brainwashed comments dont surprise me since the "unhingement" of the Democrat's election loss and watching cnn with absolutely  no facts to back up their lies. Hussain obama still sprewing.  Do you people not see the numbers with security,low unemployment stocks up, jobs?
4506 2018-09-07 17:09:13 I picked 2 other stocks at random (kroger and apache corp) and they both did it in the 1990s too
4507 2018-09-07 17:08:47 Sounds like this is a partisan college bent on doing nothing. Nike stocks aren't dropping but going strong. #NikeCampaign
4508 2018-09-07 17:08:43 Literally everything Elon Musk does makes his stocks drop. He goes on Joe Rogan and hits a blunt and shareholders sell his stock. This man does not give a single fuck, yet everyone in the world wants him to.
He gives 0 fucks about share it’s all a money scheme
4509 2018-09-07 17:08:34 Long consolidations. Yearly returns in a week is all I am looking for. I like such stocks.
4510 2018-09-07 17:08:18 It’s just a scam it’s all about the money  all of the higher ups probably sold an ass load of stocks before the advertisement and made millions and then let the company tank by advertising that asshole now they can buy the Stocks back for pennies on the dollar. $$$$$
4511 2018-09-07 17:06:10 Take that chart back to Jan 1 and then new home sales as well, it shows why.... late 2017 move higher in stocks and new home sales was a head fake, no way we could have a 700K sales trend for 2018
4512 2018-09-07 17:05:20 Don’t talk to me about no bag nigga buy me stocks!!!
4513 2018-09-07 17:05:11 Elon Musk has caused #Tesla stocks to fall. Do you think that with everything he's done, does #ElonMusk deserve to still be in charge of a public company?
4514 2018-09-07 17:05:07 Have we reached the point of $TSLA exhaustion on twitter? Can I go back to my feed of watching 26 year olds try to spread fake news about jr mining stocks?
4515 2018-09-07 17:04:08 But tbh I think Robinhood is the best app for stocks unless you have an account directly with a bank haha
4516 2018-09-07 17:02:55 One puff man and his stocks dropped. Crazy.
4517 2018-09-07 17:02:10 Did cannabis stocks go up today ?
4518 2018-09-07 17:02:09 The reasons @tesla stocks are down are nonsensical, and are going to be short-lived (no pun intended). Is production down, are they closing factories or recalling cars?  No, it's because @elonmusk has one puff of a cigar and calls an arrogant a&&hole a pedo. I see no danger here.
4519 2018-09-07 17:01:20 That’s not freedom. From what I have researched, it’s not the stocks or contracts that people sign that make people rich in history. It’s actually mainly involved in businesses and real estate, but not realtors.
4520 2018-09-07 17:01:05 So Elon Musk takes a hit of a joint and stocks plunge, people resign..  and he loses 3.1 BILLION dollars..  that was one expensive joint.  The price of pot really has gone up.   LOL   #insane #justsayno
4521 2018-09-07 17:00:33 Question for Weiss: @ScottWapnerCNBC, What percentage of the time is @stephenLweiss actually right with his calls on stocks? My guess, 5%. LMAO.
4522 2018-09-07 17:00:07 Stock drop: $KFY and 2 other stocks drop. The Common Wealth is investigating! Reach out for more info. TheCommonWealth.mail@gmail.com #StockDrop #KFY
4523 2018-09-07 16:59:28 Elon musk got baked af and Tesla stocks went down. Lmao wtf
4524 2018-09-07 16:59:22 London's warehoused food stocks are burning: "There are pepper fires, loading the air with stinging particles; rum fires, barrels exploding like bombs." #WW2
4525 2018-09-07 16:58:50 Chinese stocks believe this is not additional tariff amount
4526 2018-09-07 16:58:25 Or AR-15's and bump stocks. Shut up, Lindsay. You're tiresome.
4527 2018-09-07 16:57:27 At midday, Mortgage Bonds lower on inflation fears. Stocks lower as trade war fears escalate. 10-yr yield 2.93%.
4528 2018-09-07 16:57:16 President Trump readies another $267B in tariffs on China, starts trade negotiations with Japan. Stocks decline.
4529 2018-09-07 16:57:12 @RedlerAllAccess it's really getting easier to trade from the short side now. $googl down 6th Street days. $wynn ugly. A lot of stocks with momentum to the downside
4530 2018-09-07 16:56:39 Stocks open lower as higher wages raises rate hike fears.
4531 2018-09-07 16:56:25 The higher wage growth conjures up some inflation fears. Stocks push lower on fears of heightened rate hike fears.
4532 2018-09-07 16:56:06 This wasn't the best week for Tech stocks... Facebook dropped 7.5 percent this last week, probably due to the recent controversies surrounding the tech world and government regulation. I am looking forward to a healthy bounce back soon, though.
4533 2018-09-07 16:55:07 On the bright side, waving the boogeyman of “even suggesting that maybe some self-control is in order means you want a hellscape of putting people in public stocks for a snog behind the barn” isn’t working anymore.  Because people have eyes in their heads.
4534 2018-09-07 16:55:06 Actually i do. I can go online to Indeed, Monster & other job sites & see the difference. I have friends that have changed jobs to better paying ones, including myself. The stocks i have? Gone through the roof. So yes, i have real proof vs graphs. Think as you please, i'm good.
4535 2018-09-07 16:54:52 Sis I need advice on stocks and investing my money to be profitable. Can you give me some pointers or know someone?
4536 2018-09-07 16:54:46 @realDonaldTrump readies another $267B in tariffs on China, starts trade negotiations with Japan. Stocks decline.
4537 2018-09-07 16:54:18 It's concerning that half the country thinks weed is good for you and should be included with free lunches in public schools, while the other half think weed is responsible for 90% of the bad choices in the world. 

Guess which half owns the most stocks... 



 "Tesla Stock"
4538 2018-09-07 16:53:36 @reslDonaldTrump readies another $267B in tariffs on China, starts trade negotiations with Japan. Stocks decline.
4539 2018-09-07 16:53:18 Your milkshake theory is ingenious. Also, long stocks can easily be described as a pain trade. But what makes you so certain US stocks should perform in abs terms rather than relative terms?
4540 2018-09-07 16:52:49 It’s a risky move that’s high risk and high reward. Stocks seem to suggest it’s paying off for now
4541 2018-09-07 16:52:48 Stocks were already a worry after the CFO resigned, the weed didnt do it fam
4542 2018-09-07 16:52:42 Whatever it is it is bullish consumer internet stocks.
4543 2018-09-07 16:52:21 Time to buy stocks!
4544 2018-09-07 16:52:09 Remember how, after last year's mass shooting in Las Vegas, everyone (Public/Congress/NRA/Trump) was all about banning bump stocks? Guess what you can still by in nearly any state.
4545 2018-09-07 16:51:47 i’ve made a whopping six dollars so far. but i buy cheap stocks because i’m afraid of losing money. so i’ve gained good money for the stocks that i buy, yeah lol. hopefully what i invested in just sky rockets but  wishful thinking
4546 2018-09-07 16:51:42 Canada loses 51,600 jobs in August, pushing up unemployment rate.  This idiot and @JustinTrudeau are killing Canada worst finance minister in Canadian history did the fm and pm invest in rail stocks and then ensure all pipelines in Canada are dead unethical criminals
4547 2018-09-07 16:51:31 $OGRMF started on fire today.... reached 52 week high but has reset to a good dip review.  im going in for more at $5.30   love the ride on these great stocks!

4549 2018-09-07 16:51:00 DOWJ , NASDAQ, S&P 500 all slightly lower this mid afternoon !  #Stocks #Markets #StockMarket #Investor #Trading #Money
4550 2018-09-07 16:50:49 The pedophile remarks made the stocks drop as well, but only by 4% so apparently slandering a hero is not as bad as smoking a joint.

This fucking world, I swear.
4551 2018-09-07 16:50:41 In #Crypto world when all else is #hope you know you are screwed to your garage wall together with all your tools! #hope is the most disastrous event when you are underwater. Day in day out how many times did we #hope things will get better, stocks go higher, crypto go higher?
4552 2018-09-07 16:50:41 Tesla stock drops because a video of @elonmusk smoking green comes out?? Lmao, I love it. Get these losers out of Tesla stocks Elon. Keep smokin the good good.
4553 2018-09-07 16:50:26 I think they are marketing geniuses! What a better way to drum up sales than to get a reaction from you? so far this year Nike shares have climbed 28%. It sounds like you're just shorting the stock market with your rants. Making some money on Nike stocks?
4554 2018-09-07 16:50:17 @NancyPelosi @SpeakerRyan @SenWarren @HouseDemocrats @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @SenateDems  Look at the stocks since the president announced his intention. Dow, Nasdaq, S&P were looking good, his announcement sent them straight to losses.
4555 2018-09-07 16:49:58 Will today be the day i finally get rid of my Fosrich stocks.... let's see
4556 2018-09-07 16:49:57 My wife: I’m not really into investing so I’m just happy you enjoy crypto.

Also my wife: made enough so we can retire?

I’m just happy she doesn’t ask “How are your Bitcoin stocks doing” anymore.
4557 2018-09-07 16:49:51 @rascal2668 water does the trick but stocks makes u money. ... lol
4558 2018-09-07 16:49:27 @joerogan 10% drop in stocks for smoking a joint with you.... that is going to be hard to top.... Awesome conversation to listen to....  Saludos desde Mexico !
4559 2018-09-07 16:49:05 All these comments abt the economy booming, just because stocks are high, doesn’t mean the economy is good. Jeez.
4560 2018-09-07 16:48:42 Congress needs to impeach him very soon. They have the Power. Do it before we have a War or Stocks Crash into Hell..one or the other!
4561 2018-09-07 16:48:23 Time to empty my savings on Tesla stocks
4562 2018-09-07 16:47:43 Just to be clear, as soon as Obama left office, the stocks skyrocketed, employment rises & jobs recovered not because of Obama but because people became optimistic when @realDonaldTrump came in office. #obamaisafraud
4563 2018-09-07 16:47:03 @elonmusk took a hit and so did @Tesla's stocks.
4564 2018-09-07 16:46:57 How can US #stocks trade for such healthy multiples when the world is about to go thru a major wave of technological disruption? In last night's report we reviewed a recent McKinsey Global Institute study on the future of #AI for some answers & tied it to key investable themes.
4565 2018-09-07 16:46:47 Hoy el stock market iba bien las equities se estaban nivelando y los emerging markets estaban saliendo de un bear run de como un mes... y Trump decidio anunciar $267 billones en tarifas a China encima de $200 billones ya aplicadas, todos los stocks perdieron sus gains del dia
4566 2018-09-07 16:46:42 As a financial advisor - dont worry - the market always moves up and down. Money in stocks should always be viewed as high risk/ high reward for a date the distant future. (Hope that helps, reassures you)
4567 2018-09-07 16:46:37 ah man! nike, you okay? it’s gotta really hurt, knowing people are changing the channel when your commercial comes on  btw congrats on your stocks already coming back up!
4568 2018-09-07 16:46:36 they don't know how to change the rules from 2m:30s items and smash balls to stocks and no items, weren't instructed how to
so there's no reserved setups for 1v1s, you play with the people that come so yeah
4569 2018-09-07 16:46:21 #FAANG stocks had a nice run.

I wouldn't hold any of them in next 12 to 18 months.
4570 2018-09-07 16:46:06 For those still holding #btc #bitcoin n believe what blog says it will recover, dont bet on it. #sharks are all over the place getting ready to ripped your wallet apart. You still have a chance. Buy them back at much lower level,  double up at lower level. #stocks #bonds #Crypto
4571 2018-09-07 16:45:47 i can’t believe tesla stocks fell after elon smoked a big doink . the republicans were shooketh
4572 2018-09-07 16:45:44 Involve unemployed on live stocks and fruit devlp by giving them land and loans. Bring new fruits pesticide, and new form of cultivation.
4573 2018-09-07 16:44:51 (LRT) whomst the fuck is crying about their stocks when this presidency is making life unnecessarily harder for a lot of us lol
4574 2018-09-07 16:44:43 I’m on them Nike stocks.
4575 2018-09-07 16:44:18 Tesla stocks went down "because he was see on video smoking marijuana and sipping whiskey." My fuck.
4576 2018-09-07 16:44:03 They want their stocks to tank so Nike can buy them back at a reduced price.
4577 2018-09-07 16:43:37 The guy is playing 5D chess... He'll buy those stocks and make Tesla private again
4578 2018-09-07 16:43:06 @larry_kudlow DOW DOWN ALMOST 200 points U.S. Stocks Fall as Trump Escalates Trade Spat: WE WILL LOSE THE MIDTERMS IF THIS DOWN MARKET CONTINUES! DO IT AFTER MIDTERMS!!!

4580 2018-09-07 16:42:24 Is smash 4 bad because of all the bs ways to take stocks, or because the sheer amount of characters makes it ridiculously hard to keep track of all the bs all the time?
4581 2018-09-07 16:41:44 Sir Gee... Please work on live stocks dev...it's very easy and progrsv. Make your priority. Please make new minst. For Luce stock & fruits..
4582 2018-09-07 16:41:31 Tesla stocks dropped ‘cause Musk smoked weed on JRE.. sounds like a great time to buy Tesla stocks
4583 2018-09-07 16:41:15 3D Systems Corp (DDD) up 1.9229% 19.029 per share #stocks
4584 2018-09-07 16:41:06 Not to mention that the "magic wand" they've used to juice stocks and GDP numbers is HUGE NEW DEFICITS from the party of "fiscal responsibility". That's how much they hated Obama, they forced huge deficit reductions which slowed recovery (hurt people), until Trump gets credit.
4585 2018-09-07 16:40:52 Europe stocks = garbage.

Not buying at any level.  This is a real puke out...which could be of epic proportions.  Very oversold....but that is also a tell!  Zero bounce!
4586 2018-09-07 16:40:35 How stupid!! Would stocks have gone down if he had a drink? Some people are so stupid
4587 2018-09-07 16:40:04 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
4588 2018-09-07 16:39:58 Ill trade anything that's "in play" definitely don't limit yourself to only stocks in a certain price range.
4589 2018-09-07 16:38:38 I should buy some Tesla stocks while they are down because they're obviously gonna go back up when this blows over 
4590 2018-09-07 16:38:17 Scam that Jew - invest in Nike after their stocks drop below to almost nothing after that stupid decision to sign Kaepernick. Then when they realize they went full retard and come out and say it was a major mistake their stocks skyrocket & you're rich!
4591 2018-09-07 16:38:06 If we are serious about fighting corruption let’s try
1. Digitize all land registry & link owners BVN.
2. Link vehicle ownership to BVN
3. Lift veil on beneficial owners of stocks & report insider trades 
 #AfricaAgainstCorruption #DGTrends
4592 2018-09-07 16:37:42 stop shorting vol and just buy some pot stocks
4593 2018-09-07 16:37:08 Because Tesla stocks are down
4594 2018-09-07 16:36:56 At this point it's safe to say that Elon is deliberately trying to bring down his stocks. No other explainiation.
4595 2018-09-07 16:36:55 Joe Rogan: “Do people get upset when you do certain things?”
@elonmusk -holds blunt for a solid minute-
*Elons brain* “Who gives a fuck.”
*Elons face* “who gives a fuck”
Elons adviser “but Tesla’s stocks will go down 9 percent!”
*Elons Elon* “Who gives a fuck”
4596 2018-09-07 16:36:42 ca  veut liquider les stocks. j'attends encore pour le 1080 ti a 500 euros
4597 2018-09-07 16:36:17 who’s hopping on them Tesla stocks tho 
4598 2018-09-07 16:36:04 Don't worry their stocks are starting to show how wrong they are.
4599 2018-09-07 16:35:14 Trump's policy are so good his tax cut can't even pay for a federal employee raise. This tariffs actually increased the trade deficit and amounted to a welfare check for the farmers.....and how many trump supporters actually own stocks?
4600 2018-09-07 16:35:10 Yesterday if u track HDFC Bank n other Banking stocks... Suddenly USDINR jump 71.85 to 72.15 n HDFC Bank down 8₹in just 10 minutes.
4601 2018-09-07 16:35:06 i ask that of a lot of things, not just weed stocks.  
4602 2018-09-07 16:34:32 Telsa stocks dropping because Elon Musk smoked weed on a podcast? Really? I seriously don't understand some people...
4603 2018-09-07 16:34:17 I recently started using @beanstox. Trying to learn how stocks work. I’m over here watching these numbers like I’m watching a horse race and cheering them on.
4604 2018-09-07 16:34:16 Canadian cult stocks (Canadian funds require x% ownership of Canadian companies), weed etf, & oct catalyst
4605 2018-09-07 16:33:54 I don't buy individual stocks, just index funds. But if I did, I'd buy Tesla today.
4606 2018-09-07 16:33:29 The company does well when people can afford to purchase from them. My husband gets stocks, yet we’ve had to cash them in just to pay the bills due to low wages. When is it enough? These companies need salary/option caps. There needs to be a balance.
4607 2018-09-07 16:33:17 Musk smokes a joint and drinks whiskey with Joe in a legalized state, and Tesla’s stocks drop almost 7% not even like 20 hours later....#nowsthetimetoobuy
4608 2018-09-07 16:32:44 O.k. to drink a beer....  o.k. to hype alcohol stocks....time to rethink your position on that.
4609 2018-09-07 16:32:44 Damn I need to start looking at these 20$ stocks. I see a perfect entry low risk setup that follows my rules/strategy. Pretty clean too. Hmmm 
4610 2018-09-07 16:32:40 The 1 month is what I call my "early turn" screen... it looks for stocks that are transitioning from stage 1 to stage 2.

4615 2018-09-07 16:31:36 Bruh. #ElonMusk smoked some weed and the stocks went down. Time to buy, cuz that shits going back up so you'll make some $$. It's funny, because if he drank instead, no one would give a shit.
4616 2018-09-07 16:31:33 Je ne connais pas les stocks, fait vite ^^
4617 2018-09-07 16:31:07 Lol, why did his stocks go down? CEOs drink a ton and it doesn't seem to matter. Cannabis stocks are doing great BTW. Maybe he'll make space weed.
4618 2018-09-07 16:31:02 dude do they not get it why he is doing this
he is trying to get Tesla stocks to go down in price
so he can buy them up
4619 2018-09-07 16:30:54 U.S. stocks lower early afternoon Friday,09/07/18: $DJIA -0.58% at 25,846.06, $SPX -0.32% at 2,868.86, $COMPQ -0.20% at 7,906.59, $RUT +0.03% at $1714.99.
4620 2018-09-07 16:30:44 Maybe if the media would stop ragging on @elonmusk  then it would stop affecting the stocks. Elon musk has made jobs and is good for the US economy. The media harping on him makes people do thing in relation to stock. Media calm down please and say some good please.
4621 2018-09-07 16:30:33 buying @Nike stocks as I tweet
4622 2018-09-07 16:30:29 maybe its time to be full neutral evil and get into stocks huh
4623 2018-09-07 16:30:28 @fbi Also, you must examine Russian stock buys & sales of American stocks.
4624 2018-09-07 16:29:38 there go my tesla's stocks
4625 2018-09-07 16:29:33 Two major execs left the company this week, stocks gonna drop even if he saved a burning school of children
4626 2018-09-07 16:29:07 I got out of tech stocks completely, which has made me relatively immune from this current sell off. Also, I find most of them unconscionable.
4627 2018-09-07 16:29:07 Stocks to watch:

$GEMP $AMD $SSC $NVUS $TNDM $FNSR $CLDR $OKTA $ABM $NFLX $PDD $CRON $SENS $ARWR $HTGM $GEVO $TLRY $ZS $NLST $INSG $CGC
4628 2018-09-07 16:28:41 You use that term "stocks". Americans don't use that phrase. It's either "stock" or "stock options".
4629 2018-09-07 16:28:05 The example of market stocks he put on discussion was a good argument against himself. Well done dr. Craig
4630 2018-09-07 16:27:28 2018 Tesla report is as follows

Musk tokes a joint: Tesla stocks drop 9%
Musk snorts a fat line: Tesla stocks drop 12%
Musk pops a sizeable E: Tesla stocks drop 15%
Musk inhales a tank of nitrous: Tesla stocks drop 20%
Musk laps up some juicy acid: Tesla stocks drop 30%
4631 2018-09-07 16:27:25 what did pot stocks do??
@Stockhunteress
4632 2018-09-07 16:26:56 Main point is to find such stocks. That nobody tells

4635 2018-09-07 16:26:33 ''U.S. stocks turned lower after President Donald Trump signaled he’s ready to escalate the trade war with China.''
4636 2018-09-07 16:26:29 Anyway, enough with the rants about the National Team. Share ko lang, alam nyo bang bagsak na naman stocks ng Megaworld? Closed today at 4.40. I earned enough in MEG Stocks:

2017: 4.22 to 5.35 = 26% gain
April 2018: 4.35 to 4.78 = 10% gain
August 2018: 4.35 to 5 = 15% gain
4637 2018-09-07 16:26:10 No bruh its gonna depreciate the worth of the stocks after a while
4638 2018-09-07 16:25:52 @TeamCavuto Since you and your guest got on your negative track the stocks are lower. Wow! Gasperino and you need a new job!
4639 2018-09-07 16:25:21 Honestly, it seems like an intentional move BY Elon. He’s a freaking genius, I’m sure he’s WELL aware of how his actions effect stocks. So, what’s he up to?
4640 2018-09-07 16:25:14 Ghost hope #ElizabethWarren is the Dem Nominee.  All you will see is wall to wall ads for 23 and me or Ancestry DNA boxes .  I should buy their stocks now!
4641 2018-09-07 16:24:30 Flower Fun Fact Friday!! 

If you ever want to say “You’ll always be beautiful to me” with flowers - look no further! 

Stocks represent lasting beauty and symbolise a happy life. These are the perfect blooms for anniversary gifts
4642 2018-09-07 16:24:27 So you think 'cash', 'loans' 'net worth', 'bills' (on that Godley and Lavoie table) means stocks ?
4643 2018-09-07 16:24:16 $10/hr is the pay rate set by the board members of the company for lowest paid workers. CEO made $11.1M with stock options. Not everyone is a flight attendant and stocks aren’t offered until you’re near the top of the ladder. Please explain why the CEO needs 164x the pay rate.
4644 2018-09-07 16:23:50 And now he's paying the consequences!  Tesla stocks take a plunge.
4645 2018-09-07 16:23:14 thoughts:

-entry is always most important, doesn't matter the style
-overnight risk depends on asset class, large cap stocks gap up more than they gap down
-always having trade on makes life easier b/c means I'm always getting profits from somewhere (hopefully anyway)
4646 2018-09-07 16:22:35 @fbi Definitely need to investigate stock sales of military stocks.  When was the Raytheon bombing of Syria discussed with Putin?  Look at big trades...also when Esper was being considered by Trump.  Same with Heather Wilson.
4647 2018-09-07 16:22:25 Time to start investing in these stocks! I’m excited
4648 2018-09-07 16:22:20 Vos y tus stocks  jaja
4649 2018-09-07 16:21:38 Also...the YTD in return is only 4.5%.  in another month that's gonna be the 1 year average.  Stocks went up right after the tax cuts bc republicans believe in them.  They've been flat since that short rush.

4651 2018-09-07 16:21:14 Nice. I’m rooted in the Real Estate sector cause my dad has a construction I’m going to take over in a few years. Also US REIT stocks were the first stocks I bought and still own. +.1 @xrptipbot
4652 2018-09-07 16:21:10 @joerogan media is portraying @elonmusk smoking weed on your show is partly the reason Tesla stocks down 9% 

Like, what fucking year is it?
4653 2018-09-07 16:21:04 With stocks already falling because of Elon accusing a individual of being a Pedophile and lack of financial backers which forced him to seek backing from Saudi Arabia to Privatize the business & his expulsion of employees tends to increase time to expect such new developments.

4655 2018-09-07 16:21:03 Don’t think you are smarter than the market. After years of buying stocks and sector specific ETFs thinking I had quality insights and getting returns less than S&P, I just sold it all and went robo.
4656 2018-09-07 16:20:52 i wanna invest in some stocks but i’m not sure which ones just yet 
4657 2018-09-07 16:20:50 i know exactly who you’re talking about without even telling me.. they should’ve invested in some more stocks maybe?? 
4658 2018-09-07 16:20:33 I know there will be a lot of finger-wagging, gloating Villa fans right now. But football finances are fucked. They're like stocks and shares - they make no sense at all. No wonder clubs are going to the wall. #avfc #bcfc

4662 2018-09-07 16:18:35 That was a joke. I'm aware of his intellect and his workaholic self. He was just chilling during the podcast n did a lil weed which is totally legal  I don't know why it's a big fuss on Twitter n is actually reflecting in the Tesla stocks
4663 2018-09-07 16:18:19 Well then...Tesla stocks going down and weed stocks are going up xD

4675 2018-09-07 16:15:37 For all the racists screaming “Nike’s stock is going to crash!  Get out now!” a few days ago, a huge swath of the market did in fact fall hard the last couple days. Strange thing was, Nike was among the few stocks that not only held steady but gained in price.
4676 2018-09-07 16:14:40 A man with the best science in the world at the top of his fingers, in an internet interview called a "podcast", smokes legal marihuana -- it causes his company's stocks to drop. This is some hilarious Kurt Vonnegut shit, man. #ElonMusk

4681 2018-09-07 16:13:07 Hey Trumpsters, u GOP tax cut lovers...it’s causing middle & poor folks-killing inflation.

4682 2018-09-07 16:13:03 They weren't thinking!  And now their stocks are dropping and will continue too!  People/corporations will never get it!  We the people are done & we want our country back!  We are patriotic, proud!  We respect our flag, vets & LEOs!

4686 2018-09-07 16:11:57 I started trading 5/6 years ago with stocks. The first year i lost like 80%, and it took 2 years to recover from that loss. I think i started to be reasonably profitable when i recovered that money and started again.

4689 2018-09-07 16:10:50 Yes. This is the worst argument Bitcoiners make. Inflation has all sorts of problems, chiefly benefitting the rich over the poor, but nobody cares that their dollar won't be worth much in 100 years. Especially if their money is in stocks, which have outperformed inflation.

4705 2018-09-07 16:07:36 There's no statistically relevant effect as far as I can tell. It's been going down for days, and stocks are mostly random walks. That said, I'd love the stock to drop 10x due to a bunch of bigots, so I can finally buy some :-)
4706 2018-09-07 16:07:31 Strange, I was blocked by David in May because we disagreed on the direction of the cannabis sector. He described it as bloated stocks, overhyped plant, and trending down. My stance was long term bullish on the different avenues cannabis can be used. He's a bull now? #potstocks
4707 2018-09-07 16:07:25 Joe Rogan tests Musk by lighting a hot dog size joint. Musk talks about how he rarely smokes, how it's counterproductive, and he never points out that this is an abnormally large, hotdog-size joint... hits it like a PRO. Musk gets high, stocks get low. It is what it is.

4716 2018-09-07 16:04:15 Check his stocks right now...most expensive blunt ever.
4717 2018-09-07 16:03:58 Tesla stocks drop after @elonmusk is seen smoking a joint.  Really? What if he was smoking it in a legalized state?
4718 2018-09-07 16:03:09 Tesla's stocks dropped 9 percent this morning.
4719 2018-09-07 16:02:46 One of, if not the most important reason that Sessions will never allow legalization. He doesn't want to release "those" people from jails and prisons. Plus, his private prison stocks would probably suffer.
4720 2018-09-07 16:02:43 fake news in the view of all denying gold bugs....ok is there any historical comparison of a gold stock during the great depression or post tech bubble? I think that gives gold stocks a light at the end of the tunnel.....
4721 2018-09-07 16:02:29 First there was @DineshKarthik  Vijay and @ashwinravi99 . Then there was Karthik and Ashwin then there was Ashwin now there is none. Like Tamil politics their stocks are fast dwindling.

4723 2018-09-07 16:02:19 .@Tesla stocks are tanking after @elonmusk smoked a blunt on video, and a number of executives are resigning. Yikes!
4724 2018-09-07 16:02:13 Yes, the Stock Market is up. You do now that index is the average of the stock value of 30 companies. Not many Americans own those stocks, or any stocks for that matter. Real workers income has declined to the level of the 1970s.

4730 2018-09-07 16:00:12 I'm waiting to see if Elon Musk's stocks gets as high as him
4731 2018-09-07 16:00:12 So in all this fundamental news, we must look at undervalued stocks. $MU has been hit HARD recently over trade talks, resistance etc. I stand firm that a $57-60 PT is still realistic. Avg PT of major analysts is still $83 and $BAC backs it's buy rating. #stocks #investment
4732 2018-09-07 16:00:00 Bonds are trading as junk too, appearances matter when you are the CEO of a publicly traded company that's leveraged and stocks under pressure. Musk is acting like the child. It's just a few billion in market cap.

The probablity of this occuring is less than the probability of a meteor taking out your BBQ grill. 
However, I would worry about seveal 1%ers buying into your stock, shorting it, then selling off their holdings.

- Whenever u sell a stocks, it rises fast from next day

- Whenever you think of buying a stock & don’t buy, it rises even faster

- You will always have small exposure in your winning stock & very large holding in most underperformer

It's not about taking everyone's guns, it's about getting better laws on the books. 
No guns for mentally ill or commits domestic violence. Limit how much ammo you can buy. Eliminate bump stocks & gun show loophole.

4752 2018-09-07 15:54:27 Yes. I like Nifty 50 index + Next 50 index fund + Equal weight Nifty 100. First two are "momentum" oriented as it increases allocation to constituents which have risen the most . Last one is "contra" as it adds constituent stocks which are losing prices.

4755 2018-09-07 15:53:39 Amazing how the press freaks out because Elon musk smoked a JOINT during an interview . Stocks drop 9 % ? WTF If he was having a drink only nothing would of been said no one would care BUT WEED It is LEGAL and  You think none of these brilliant scientist never smoked weed ?

4762 2018-09-07 15:52:01 I think he know and is fueling the strategy by reacting. If Nike pulls market shares from its competitors it’ll prop up US stocks collectively and he as the President gets the credit for a booming economy.

4774 2018-09-07 15:47:21 Same problem with me also brother. I bought 50 when the share was at 384 and another 50 at 346. The profits of other stocks is being nullified by #yesbank. But, somehow I feel it will bounce back after RBI decision on CEO reappointment. Needlessly they are prolonging.
4775 2018-09-07 15:46:37 This is why I believe that the stock market based economy is such a sham. I have my own reasons for losing my respect for Elon Musk of late. But for Tesla stocks to fall arbitrarily based on him smoking weed during a podcast?? That’s just insane.

4781 2018-09-07 15:44:13 Conspiracy theory:
@elonmusk knows Tesla CAO has quit, stocks will fall next day
So he makes sure to take a puff of weed on @joerogan's podcast, knowing idiots will sell more stocks
He buys back a lot of stocks for cheap
1 year later, biggest leap in battery pack tech

4798 2018-09-07 15:39:08 Indeed, I think leading us into an illegal war and selling off a load of gold stocks at its cheapest rate posed an existential crisis to the party. I know people who still refuse a bar of Labour for that alone.
4799 2018-09-07 15:39:05 First try to pick stocks through the search bar on top. Search random names and discard them or choose them on the basis of promoter holding, balancesheet, earnings and business. If business is niche then track the stock.
4800 2018-09-07 15:38:11 when pot stocks are listed on the NYSE and other REAL companies are investing Billions in cash in those companies, i call that mainstream.
stats  52% of adults have tried pot. of those 44% still use.
just where does your definition of MainStream being?
4801 2018-09-07 15:37:51 $nke stocks are back up so your anti #Kapernik campaign is .  This will boost sales in the long run.
4802 2018-09-07 15:37:18 I'd rather have my eyes sucked out by a vacuums cleaner than jump in a bear pit, no need to take that much risk lol Stocks move just as much as crypto
4803 2018-09-07 15:37:12 TWN Stocks: Let's harp on TaiMed Biologics (TMB (4147 中裕)) a bit more - so it reported August sales of $764K (USD).  BFD.  That's what?   Single digits in prescriptions sold?   I dunno, I'm just guessing and speculating here...
4804 2018-09-07 15:37:08 Tesla stocks went down but you know who’s laughing? Elon. Because he’s got it all ready for market. Tesla grinder. Tesla bong. Tesla Rizla. Tesla Weed; Tesla indica. Tesla sativa
4805 2018-09-07 15:36:40 I would venture to say that they were never worried about sales or stocks plummeting. Nike is a household staple now...this "burning product" is just another over reactionary stunt that white people do when they don't get their way. 
4806 2018-09-07 15:36:20 Well, their stocks are back up, sooooooo..... seems like they're successful business people.
4807 2018-09-07 15:36:18 did the guns now I’m on to butter..stocks, art n shit

4811 2018-09-07 15:35:04 .@RiskReversal I love the blatant hypocrisy of @jimcramer and others bashing Musk about weed, and at the same time hyping pot stocks. Like somehow those who peddle pot stocks are somehow less culpable than someone who partakes. Ironic, don’t you think?
4812 2018-09-07 15:35:00 Wood stocks is where it's at
4813 2018-09-07 15:34:39 $TSLA quiz time. Is Elon Musk good or bad for marijuana stocks? $GWPH $APHQF $CNTTF $EMHTF $NXXTF $CRON $CGC $TLRY
4814 2018-09-07 15:34:28 Let’s get one thing straight:  THE COUNTRY IS NOT DOING GREAT FOR EVERYONE! That is a hollow statement to most average Americans without 401k’s. NOTHING TRICKLED DOWN! Companies bought back stocks.  YOUR IDEA OF A HEALTH CARE PLAN SUCKS-BIGLY!  Premiums going up, deductibles, too
4815 2018-09-07 15:34:18 People who perform their personal grooming routines in public places should be put in the stocks...
4816 2018-09-07 15:34:15 What has the stock done since that day? And what has happened to the  stocks of Adidas, Puma and Under Armour in that same span? Facts don't  come from just one day.
4817 2018-09-07 15:34:14 What recent polling?  Where?
Stocks were already heading back up.
4818 2018-09-07 15:34:08 Oh ETH is Ethereum, ETC is Ethereum Classic. I've been investing since I made my first few dollars (Started in Gold and moved to stocks and BTC) honestly investing money is the best way to ensure you don't spend it and save it. Savings accounts are Garbage and so are Banks
4819 2018-09-07 15:33:57 @charliebilello any slides / charts on what stocks are driving majority of SPX returns this year ?
4820 2018-09-07 15:33:48 Tesla be like "oops my stocks shidded"
4821 2018-09-07 15:33:35 First of all, #JRE is not a comedy show. Second of all, people are wack if they think a little bit of marijuana defines a person to the point where his company’s stocks drop. One toke of weed. Wtf?
4822 2018-09-07 15:33:24 I am not into stocks. Although I have invested in S&P 500 index fund. Also have a managed account outsourcing decision making to others. It’s likely some of you shorts may be managing my funds ironically. So Tesla is not about money for me.
4823 2018-09-07 15:33:21 PSA: if anyone fucks with the stock market I suggest you start buying into marijuana stocks. Canada plans on legalizing weed in October so get ready to make bank.
4824 2018-09-07 15:33:19 The huge institutions don’t just trade the same 5 tech stocks. Neither should you.

4842 2018-09-07 15:26:13 Stocks of Nike are up and counter protests are boosting sales
4843 2018-09-07 15:26:07 Do stocks fall when CEO’s drink alcohol?

4852 2018-09-07 15:24:01 Listen your one of this Express Mail reading Gammon that think smog is clever he won’t even debate experts in global trade and he sees no problem with hard border in NI, he invests in cannabis stocks in Canada but denies cannabis for his fellow citizens he is a charlatan

4858 2018-09-07 15:22:35 Not again!  If we are gonna ping pong like this for another 2 weeks, then I might as well trade marijuana stocks since that seems to be the “in” thing to do
4859 2018-09-07 15:22:31 Time to look into buying some Tesla stocks. Talk about a dumbass correlation.
4860 2018-09-07 15:21:50 Good now we can buy some more tesla stocks 
4861 2018-09-07 15:21:31 Don’t be hypocrites, how many of you gays are investing in marijuana or promoting it stocks

4863 2018-09-07 15:20:38 Liberals are claiming conservatives aren't boycotting Nike. Yet the Nike stocks have yet to recover from their massive drop and probably never will.
4864 2018-09-07 15:20:28 I used to smoke weed, a lot, for many years. I don't like it anymore, and I don't like people advocating it like it's a good things and a harmless substance. But I don't find the drop on the stocks reasonable.

4870 2018-09-07 15:19:09 Really enjoyed #naturalcapital #accounting workshop at #VlConf2018 talking about butterflies, vertical trees, the capitalist system and much more! Economics encourages thinking about who owns stocks, who benefits from them and who decides what happens and how. Exciting stuff!
4871 2018-09-07 15:18:48 @mpelle so tired of this narrative.  When did Tesla patent the EV concept?  plenty of other stocks to play that trend, w/ better CEOs
4872 2018-09-07 15:18:36 @Tankooni recorded comb into sicc stocks ?? :(
4873 2018-09-07 15:18:01 @GregMannarino The only way you can justify owning Tesla bonds/stocks is if u are smoking something stronger than the CEO.

4877 2018-09-07 15:16:22 Short reminder that in stocks, the "dev" going bonkers is usually not a good sign. Contrary to crypto, stocks have so-called fundamentals: employees, factories, earnings, yearly reports, boards, large-scale investors, the SEC etc. You can't just wait for the exit pump on stocks.
4878 2018-09-07 15:16:07 Elon musk pounded a few whiskeys but god forbid he takes a hit off a blunt. When are we going to get this stigma off marijuana? Alcohol is a millions times worse but it was the weed that caused the stocks to go down. We live in a messed up world

4886 2018-09-07 15:13:52 Bull market is - rising stocks - people buying 
Bear market is - falling stocks - people selling
Both over a span of time. Overly simplified explanation, but it works in this instance.

4890 2018-09-07 15:13:01 Too soon to have an effect. Other shoe stocks are down a similar amount.
4891 2018-09-07 15:12:44 Maam sa pull and bear yun kaso wala na sila ngayon stocks nun eh.
4892 2018-09-07 15:12:39 That’s an honest question. 

I suspect that the shedding of stocks was lead by big investment houses that saw the video as a potentially volatile event and used it to dip prices. At the same time they probably rebought after spooking regular investors.
4893 2018-09-07 15:12:22 And, yes, I do invest in tobacco companies (which have e-cig businesses - though some worry that businesses like JUUL will kill them off). I was also an equity analyst covering tobacco stocks for around 20 years, which is why I try to stay on top of all the relevant material.

4908 2018-09-07 15:08:56 @JonathanHoenig JH, be serious man, you're a hedge fund manager, not a producer. You buy the best data, pay the bests analysist, and make bests in a market that's rigged in your favor. Studies have shown that monkeys can pick stocks as well. Not sure that's even capitalism LOL!
4909 2018-09-07 15:08:56 So I guess #Mercedes and #BMW are massively undervalued stocks if we all suddenly wake up and realize $TSLA has real competition!  BTW why are people realizing this just now??  #valuationsmatter
4910 2018-09-07 15:08:36 Bullish on the vehicles or bullish on the stocks of the companies that make them? There's a huge difference.

4913 2018-09-07 15:08:12 If it was November we wouldn't have pot stocks running 300% in 2 months! Oh wait, we do! How are you navigating these wild runners and have we seen the top yet? @AllDayHolds

They were long strong stocks and short weak stocks as the hedge. In that case both moved in the opposite direction as intended and even the hedges ended up losing money.

4933 2018-09-07 15:03:23 "For the first time since 2010, it’s now easier to build wealth over an 8-year period by renting a home & investing in stocks & bonds, rather than by buying & accumulating equity," according to a study produced by Florida Atlantic Univ. & Florida International Univ.

FYI
4934 2018-09-07 15:03:18 stuff like that happens to companies all the time. It’s just how stocks work
4935 2018-09-07 15:03:12 TWN Stocks: Hate to keep harpin' on TMB (4147 中裕), since this piece of shit still carries a market cap of over $1.5B USD at today's closing price of $191 NTD - of which, there's less than $1 of sales. In other words, this loser is priced at 500x sales, with no profit in sight.

4938 2018-09-07 15:02:14 That is the fundamental problem with society's lack of education in investing. You can't blame the investment vehicle no matter if it is stocks gold fiat or crypto for natural up and down swings when you buy at the ATH and sell at the bottom every time.

4961 2018-09-07 14:55:28 I don’t care he smoked, but I do care about his behavior, which has been erratic, hurting his company. I really like Tesla and want to see where it can take us, but he has to know his behavior directly impacts his company and their stocks.
4962 2018-09-07 14:54:55 The conservatives and the patriots who stand with our president really are the majority. The left is just loud. When the left calls for a boycott, sales and profits soar. When our side boycotts, stocks drop. We #Resist with our wallets-and it works. And we will be voting.

4964 2018-09-07 14:54:39 Yup. A long, candid conversation with one of the most interesting people on the planet, and this is what people care about. Bunch of sheep-monkeys. 
And Tesla stocks fall as a result. What year is this again?
4965 2018-09-07 14:54:37 I suspect their stocks was over bloated. Instead of admitting they inflated their worth, they used an unemployable hack QB they knew would cause a drop in their worth to bring Nike back to its true worth. Basically, ignorant Colin is their cover up.

4992 2018-09-07 14:49:03 I specified entry point of the 1980 high in gold precisely for that reason! But I love idea of a portfolio measured by weight: 1oz gold to every 1oz of stocks = a balanced portfolio!

5008 2018-09-07 14:43:12 "The Economy" usually means Wall Street. 84% of all stocks are owned by the richest 10% of Americans.
5009 2018-09-07 14:42:52 Tesla stocks actually fell something like 9 points because of that interview. 
5010 2018-09-07 14:42:27 Not stocks in terms of stock market. Monetary stock meaning a balance. Talking about stock/flow consistency.

We don't spend more than we have in real terms. The economy is about real resources and real production, not numbers in a spreadsheet. Money is only a tool.
5011 2018-09-07 14:42:09 I have been using your TT for the past year. If a stock isn't on that list, I rarely consider it. If it is on that list, I zoom in and look closer.  Most stocks on the list can be eliminated fairly quickly...leaving some great candidates! And all you need is one! Just one. 1.
5012 2018-09-07 14:41:56 Pete, just pretend to buy stocks and keep the money in a safe for when you need to buy stuff on the black market for the hospital.

5068 2018-09-07 14:31:02 If you spend more than we have, we have a problem. The core of that is the spending on the social programs. So we cut down the spending we cannot afford so we can also make payments on the debt. Of course stocks will react. No one is willing to make the hard choices.

5075 2018-09-07 14:29:36 Correction. Stocks are doing great because they are artificially inflated due to tax breaks for the rich. Middle class is doing worse.
5076 2018-09-07 14:29:24 Azealia Banks told you Elon Musk was on Shrooms and Tesla stocks were just fine. Now he’s smoking weed on a podcast and Tesla plunges. #FOH

5079 2018-09-07 14:27:37 How did the tax cuts help you??Stock markets go up and down What stocks do you own and did you sell them while it was up cause it has now gone down My 401k has not changed up or down and My company gave each employee $75 So please tell me how have you benefited?

5081 2018-09-07 14:27:27 Don’t get logic of dip buying here, given the highest wage inflation since 2009 was just reported. Jobs data virtually guarantees Dec hike; which is bearish for the longest duration sectors of the market- namely the high flying MoMo Nazz tech stocks.
$NQ_F $QQQ $ES $DOW
5082 2018-09-07 14:27:13 As long as their 401K’s hold up in value, they will hold their nose and vote Republican. If stocks go into a bear market, they will have problems with that demographic.
5083 2018-09-07 14:26:32 Don't get fooled by the "jobs report"

5087 2018-09-07 14:25:25 Underemployment and wage stagnation combined with rising inflation and income inequality means that this jobs report means nothing. 20% still own 80% of all stocks
5088 2018-09-07 14:25:24 Yes, but not the correct publicity. Take a look at the polls numbers. Not the best business forcast or model. The biggest idiots seem to be the Nike corporate ones that are burning their own company. Stocks were down too.(don't know about yesterday).
5089 2018-09-07 14:25:17 A unkempt guy in Santa Monica came up to me and asked for some change. When I gave him $10 he exclaimed , “Funding Secured!” Then he ran into the dispensary to buy some weed. Crazy! #tesla #elonmusk #stocks #weed

5096 2018-09-07 14:23:25 USD setup has a modest negative bias into payrolls
• Flat in Asia, as US/China tariffs and US payrolls keep markets cautious
• Mixed stocks - E-mini S&P -0.1%, Nikkei -1%, SSEC +1%, AsiaxJP -0.2%
• Yesterday's 0.2% dip has turned this week's neutral setup to negative

5251 2018-09-07 13:45:05 Yes the consequences are different, for an ex. Starbucks made a political statement and was met with huge backlash, Nike made a statement and stocks dropped.

5261 2018-09-07 13:42:11 The smart people have capitalized on this in two ways. 1. They shorted the stocks and made a shitload of money. 2. Those same people have bought back in near the end of the hype and are riding the wave up. So go ahead burn your shoes. I will light my cigar with a 100 bill!

5334 2018-09-07 13:18:38 Bullshit your first 18 months in office averaged 193k/jobs per month.  While Obama's last 18 months averaged 206k/month.  Your tax cuts lined the pockets of the wealthy/corporations. Companies are buying back stocks instead of giving workers raises and generating jobs. You lied.

5351 2018-09-07 13:09:51 "Wage growth highest since 2009" is spin. It's still +2.9%, participation rate declined
Downward revision to last two month jobs data came mainly in manufacturing. Besides PMI export orders down globally. So Tariff is biting
I am bullish US stocks but No, US is not rocket economy
5352 2018-09-07 13:09:28 Yo @EdgeCGroup 

Hope you’re not still holding your #Tesla stock. But now I know why you’re looking at Herb stocks! If it’s good enough for the leader to smoke 
5353 2018-09-07 13:08:44 He showed his ignorance on how economics works..

5356 2018-09-07 13:07:29 Fact, job growth is the lowest in 5 years. Fact, wages have declined proving that giving money to the rich is never good. I agree with the stock market which is just inflated my rich corporations buying back their stocks and investing with the trillions it got from taxes. morons
5357 2018-09-07 13:07:11 Looks like stocks are about to really shit the bed. Might be a historic day coming.
5358 2018-09-07 13:07:09 The higher wage growth conjures up some inflation fears. Stocks push lower on fears of heightened rate hike fears.

5366 2018-09-07 13:04:04 I guess it's just authors will worry, if one shop stocks a lot of their books and the other shops don't often stock them - if things will change, and which way it'll go.
5367 2018-09-07 13:03:50 Why don't you try keeping trailing stop limit? These are good for stocks than options.
5368 2018-09-07 13:03:26 These are the worst types of tweets. Stocks go up and down every day. Red hats have been trying to make this same case for Nike, "they lost $xxx overnight because of Kap." It's so stupid.
5369 2018-09-07 13:01:30 Guess what? Nike's stocks have been up. It went down briefly but they have a lot of supporters. People are shopping like crazy and buying their stock. Very few listens to you any more.

5371 2018-09-07 13:01:17 I really struggle with how the market isn't 24 hour in stocks. It's a nightmare as market can open below your stop and there's nothing you can do. Used to trade AIM stocks and one iffy RNS and you are rekt.
5372 2018-09-07 13:01:09 The press is now the enemy of the people -- this is a simple answer for me. 
Look at the lies they've perpetrated in the past few years. 
Look back longer and you'll see a trail of lies. 
They think they control how we think, but they don't. 

Media stocks plunge.

5390 2018-09-07 12:52:51 Income growth is great for our citizens so program trading by the swells kicks in croaking stocks, raising interest rates the Fed can’t raise and making Obama’s debt a BIG problem. We can’t stop growing and the bankers won’t let us grow.

Otherwise why don’t why buy all stocks that are at 1 dollar and we risk 1 dollar hoping it will reach 10 dollars any time soon? This is not how it works. There is more chance that Bitcoins will go to zero than 50000 right now.

2.) Dividends don't grow at a constant rate forever, esp not from 0

5457 2018-09-07 12:34:27 The only treason here is you and the dangerous Far-Left who seek to destroy this Nation under God. Do not keep any monetary benefits from Trumps 8 yrs. donate your gains by salary, your stocks/401K , tax gains, etc. back to the government.  And, we the people thank u.

5460 2018-09-07 12:34:10 #SamsungGalaxyWatch release in the UK is absolutely rubbish. Pre-order assurances had been given for delivery today. Stocks are low - apparently.  Estimated delivery is now the 17/09. @SamsungUK and  suppliers really need to up their game. This is disappointing to say the least.

5462 2018-09-07 12:33:22 My new favorite thing to do is read stock charts. I am getting better at it. Hopefully once I get my company fully running I will put it on Penny Stocks. That may be 5 years from now, but it is still one of the goals.

5466 2018-09-07 12:29:43 I have a bunch of statistics on how breakout stocks play out.

One of the key variables that directly affects expectancy is the tightening up of price before the breakout.

So crucial to know what sways that all important expectancy figure.
5467 2018-09-07 12:29:29 Hi, Heather. If your order is £10 or more you should get the Lego cards. It can depend on which store your items will be delivered from and how much stocks they have left for this. I hope this information helps. Christina
5468 2018-09-07 12:29:23 Call it a hunch. Anyone who suggests open cage farming reduces pressures on existing wild stocks obviously hasn't thought it through very well.

5482 2018-09-07 12:25:19 They don’t care about the kids.  It’s about the money, as usual with the GOP. Contracts weren’t being renewed for Federal private prisons under Obama, and stocks fell.

5504 2018-09-07 12:14:32 So as we all await the #employment data for August, I'll pose a simple question: What do the #Volatility and #debt markets see that #stocks do not? Something to ponder ...
5505 2018-09-07 12:14:09 Then why did we need QE 2, Operation twist, QE 3 etc etc etc. Just trying to stay balanced. Yes fundamentals have been great but it's easier for PMs to buy stocks when you have a net underneath. moral hazard has put career risk on steroids.

5512 2018-09-07 12:11:28 Agree - So why doesn't management in stocks like $MPXEF make the move to USA listing? Their CEO made a statement acknowledging that a USA listing is his fall back plan. Why don't they proact & get while the getting is good?

5561 2018-09-07 11:51:22 kind of scared to get the foundation because i’ve heard so much about the shades and how specific they are so i think i need to take a trip to a store that stocks them to pick some up
5562 2018-09-07 11:51:21 Difficult to find a good source. People get frustrated and go with a mentor to help guide them.  Sad part is that people get taken advantage of. I long stocks and options.

5567 2018-09-07 11:49:28 Stocks fluctuate daily — acting like Nike is seeing drops in revenue is ill-informed at best. Three days post-release of an ad campaign hardly defines quarterly/annual outcomes.
5568 2018-09-07 11:48:51 I'm reading a lot of posts on lithium stocks calling that the bottom is in. There are trades available, but a run back up to 52 wk highs will take weeks & months of consolidation. The bigger the accumulation/consolidation phase, the bigger the bunt. Just ask bitcoin holders.
5569 2018-09-07 11:48:38 Yea, but I’ll be careful usually reverse split stocks come up with next to pump them up

5575 2018-09-07 11:47:51 For those buying Nike products I suggest buying nike stocks as well.  
5576 2018-09-07 11:47:03 They were thinking they didn’t need a strong customer base in the USA. Sure, many of you might still buy their products, but the prices are going to go up when their stocks take a hit. Plus, in my opinion, their products were crap anyways.

5630 2018-09-07 11:09:57 Agreed. It’s a risk for sure. I dare say only the top operators will do it if it makes sense. The other consequence is the impact on next year’s seed stocks, assuming there’s a planting.
5631 2018-09-07 11:08:50 They knew it would effect their stocks... they don’t care - they’ve joined the resistance. 

They also don’t care about the horrible living conditions of the factory workers in Asia.

5632 2018-09-07 11:08:39 Sounds like they do. Why? Do you buy stocks when they are high or low?

5634 2018-09-07 11:07:00 It's too bad they did this. I hate to see any business fail. Their stocks are down. They Outsource jobs. They laid off 1400 workers last summer. Their decline continues and then they bring in the controversial Colin Kaepernick? I think Nike needs a new CEO.
5635 2018-09-07 11:06:18 supplier is still trying to secure more stocks pa daw po.
5636 2018-09-07 11:05:24 Great pics! You might need to wipe the camera lens? It looks a bit unclear.
5637 2018-09-07 11:04:24 It's not great news for the midlist. Foyles usually stocks broader than Waterstones - centralised buying would make that harder. Also drives £ down for publishers.

5647 2018-09-07 11:00:29 The point is with all that’s going on if you go into any wall mart or any Under armor dealer they have a display of American flag shirts. People are buyin them cause they are mad at Nike that’s why UA stocks are up. So market is proving me right.

5650 2018-09-07 10:58:36 Same as their campaign has always been to use powerful sports figures at different ways to highlight motivation. By the way their stocks have already rebounded and are headed up higher. And they even care about the safety of people burning their gear by releasing guides on it
5651 2018-09-07 10:58:00 Yeah, my pet peeve is that so many people think gold is a stocks hedge, when it is a currency hedge.

5709 2018-09-07 10:03:51 One more thing. Thanks to Abhishek sir I am now atleast hitting profit with most of stocks as I can identify better which one will go up or down. 

To book tht profit or let it run I guess i will learn it with some time and some more advice frm abhishek sir :)
5710 2018-09-07 10:03:27 yes :) but that's where position management comes in ... in #fno stocks we've seen.. generally anything near 4-5% we try n book half or all profit seeing the data at that point and then keep riding ... & anything near 2-3% down, we look to move out. Build ones own system. Always
5711 2018-09-07 10:01:25 LOL, no. When MIL sees it's on sale, she stocks us up!

5714 2018-09-07 10:00:28 According to BlackRock, the cost to buy and sell stocks of smaller companies has risen by 35-45% after a 2 year long experiment that changed how smaller company stocks are traded.
5715 2018-09-07 09:59:50 The collapse of the Atlantic Herring stocks will cause multiple species die-offs on the East Coast as well. The weakest link in the food chain is the herring. 
5716 2018-09-07 09:58:28 95% of those which actively trade stocks lose money and call it quits after 2 years. Whilst I agree with you, if however you held passive etfs, you would still make more than the vast majority of people who commit capital into equities in the long term.
5717 2018-09-07 09:58:02 But when tech stocks are starting their downturn BB will finally lead the tech pack with the biggest losses.

07 September 2018
South African markets closed in the green yesterday, buoyed by gains in banking sector stocks. 129 stocks closed higher, 104 closed lower and 191 were unchanged. The All Share rose 0.05% to close at 57130.48. 
What to watch today
5863 2018-09-07 07:48:15 Something I note with 'Sell-off' so far is a total absence of Panic and/or Terror etc. Usually big Sell-offs get really very scary with big drops everywhere particularly in Small Stocks. No sign of this which maybe implies a lot worse to come. ..Sorry to be so full of joy  !! ;-)

It’s only been a few days & I’ve heard they’ve lost $4 billion from stocks taking a nose dive. College of the Ozarks has cut ties with Nike, I hope more hit them where it hurts!!

6076 2018-09-07 04:30:11 Have you seen the newest reports? That bull market you inherited? It's changing due to your policies. Emerging stocks are flirting with a bear market. Uh-oh! Better pass the buck!

6078 2018-09-07 04:29:33 When stocks tank, it's like they are on sale! Big sale on Nike stock. We can buy up stock for the low. Price will rise back up sooner or later... It's the perfect storm... financially speaking.
6079 2018-09-07 04:28:18 they have preempted stocks so i have seen a bunch      they have acted horribly...i just wonder if it will hurt them in the midterms...really shameful...they are suppose to ask hard questions to get a good feel if the guy is qualified and doesnt have alot of preconceved bias

6113 2018-09-07 03:56:54 Update: After several months, the market is showing up a correction lasting a week or slightly more currently. This indicates that something is about to change and therefore if you are holding thinly traded stocks and are in for the short term perhaps take loss and exit NOW !!
6114 2018-09-07 03:56:16 And that’s why their stocks took a dive.
6115 2018-09-07 03:55:50 @bullbear2 Many have come to believe that a bounce is a given on stocks. I prefer to sell (reduce risk) and reposition when in doubt.

6170 2018-09-07 03:19:12 I agree with the fact the Globe has been Bearish on pot stocks since they were calling Canopy overvalued at 5$ . I’d say 90 % of their articles are bear based . Although When/If they start becoming bullish regularly , I’d be selling . 
6171 2018-09-07 03:19:11 I trade better when I don't "care" about a stock.  If it starts to turn on me, I sell and move on.  If it runs, I'm pleasantly surprised.

6179 2018-09-07 03:13:07 I'm no stock market genius, but could this be some form of market manipulation? Spark outrage, encourage boycotts, stocks drops, buy up stocks, a year later stocks are back to where they were, and make a profit. Could buycotts work this way as well?

6218 2018-09-07 02:53:53 The lesson here:  Own stocks and other assets if possible.  Its a beautiful system when even someone with a few dollars can purchase units in a publicly traded business.  Less taxes and more money in your pocket to invest is a good thing.
6219 2018-09-07 02:52:30 Skip, the Packers are owned by the public who own stocks in them and the Cowboys are owned by Jerry Jones. Shouldn't the team owned by the public (America) be America's team? Just saying...

6229 2018-09-07 02:48:07 What point was proven? The point is that stocks go up and down and still continue on the progressive track they are projected to go on. A 2 dollar price swing in the stock is normal and could've happened with or without kap.

Oh well. It still shows that stocks can change quite fast. My point proven.
6233 2018-09-07 02:43:59 Why dividends vs growth stocks (in the sp500)? Return on growth stocks is higher overall. Qualified dividends and LTCG taxed at same rate, so why do so many people invest in dividends?

6280 2018-09-07 02:12:15 Current implied volatility/σ for 6-month put options:

These levels not as divergent, as the divergence in the underlying's multi-month performance.
6281 2018-09-07 02:10:37 I’m guessing stocks and pillories are next. People voted for retro; damn it, the trumpsters will give them  retro.

The Nike example is to show how fast the stocks change.

So today's economy is not because of Obama sorry dude.

6293 2018-09-07 02:05:32 I think she didn’t mean to literally say that stocks are stupid. Maybe the idea na “if you invest in stocks then you are better off” yung stupid kasi it depends on how well you manage your portfolio. Also, valuation of stocks also depends on how developed capital market is.

6313 2018-09-07 01:52:49 Namaste technologies.... keep pumping, if you’re not in the stock game. This is the only time in millennial history that you have a chance to change your financial future. Get on these weed stocks. CRON, NXTTF, SPRWF now. Don’t wait.
6314 2018-09-07 01:52:42 Yeah, I've got some money I've been thinking about playing around with in stocks but I've definitely got mixed feelings about it.
6315 2018-09-07 01:52:02 You look like you're going to cause a spike in chip stocks in a spectacular fashion. Brava!
6316 2018-09-07 01:50:53 @DDTECHMX quería preguntar cuando van a tener el gabinete aerocool Cyclon RGB en negro disponible ? Ya no quedan en stocks en su página
6317 2018-09-07 01:50:08 Soundcloud investors got addicted to smoking trying to sell all their Lil stocks
6318 2018-09-07 01:49:26 What are your thoughts on Facebook long term? I remember once you tweeted that both Facebook & Netflix are buy & hold forever stocks :-).
6319 2018-09-07 01:48:43 Apples and oranges jackass. We're talking about the store's current stock.  Stay with me here. Lol. Nike almost regained all of what they lost on the first day the news broke. Stocks been up for the past few days.
6320 2018-09-07 01:48:32 #rpiFTI I choose C. Broker gets money by the information just known by two persons. If he just follows the rule helping the client buy the large amount of stocks, he won't have the extra profit, and the result of his front-running is totally just beneficial for himself.
6321 2018-09-07 01:48:32 Why did you lie about me? 

I never once said not to invest in stocks or that I haven't.  

So why the lies???
6322 2018-09-07 01:48:30 Lol i want too but they stocks is like 200$ and i only got 50$ 
6323 2018-09-07 01:48:29 That would mean we would have to stop ALL US Military actions.
Can we do that overnight?
GDP would plummet...Stocks would crash...pensions would disappear...would middle class Americans trade peace for the lose of their retirement programs?
6324 2018-09-07 01:48:11 We are setting up for this tomorrow” bad employment num. great, less fed tightening less buy stocks. Or good employment num. great economy, let’s buy some stocks”
6325 2018-09-07 01:47:59 Which they damn well know is extremely difficult in the United States as federal laws currently stand. However I disagree with those who claim it’s about stocks. It’s because the church is run by old white privileged men with free world class healthcare.
6326 2018-09-07 01:47:32 Stocks going down not up, Up is better always, Winners better, losing not good, Winning always good!
6327 2018-09-07 01:44:49 4 billion nike lost. Stocks going up the moment Trump took office, that they went up because of him etc. You're being very disingenuous here and it's tiresome. I'm totally ok reaching across the aisle but not to be gaslighted. Do you have a source for the 4 billion on nike?
6328 2018-09-07 01:44:28 bud l*ght just had a commercial where someone was put in stocks due to requesting flavorful beer. 
Kinda seems like a self own?

6330 2018-09-07 01:42:26 Who is good to follow for info on stocks?! I’m in the student phase, ready to learn.
6331 2018-09-07 01:40:13 So Nike has stocks in Chevy ... which one of y’all yee haw fucks tryna well me their dirtymax for the low ??
6332 2018-09-07 01:39:14 China is winning and can keep this up for a long time. Trump, the bully, can’t back down because he would look bad. All I know is my auto stocks have tanked and I would lose 20% if I sold them. Hopefully Trump just drops all the trade bullying so I can get my 401k back to even.
6333 2018-09-07 01:38:37 All I know is this supposed beginning bull market feels a whole lot like the bear market I have been going through with U stocks for the past few years.

6340 2018-09-07 01:34:20 Millions of dollars of United and American Airlines “put-option” stocks were traded in the week leading up to the attack. There were blatant business ties between the Bush family and Osama bin Laden.
6341 2018-09-07 01:34:08 Grasping at straws on this one. Fact checking from an opinion article. He doesn't factor in how a pipeline oil spill would effect salmon stocks in a river, and there have been 86 previous spills on this pipeline.
6342 2018-09-07 01:33:55 That chain better be connected to some stocks
6343 2018-09-07 01:33:02 European shares fell on Thursday to their lowest level in five months as worries over trade took hold and tech stocks came under pressure.
6344 2018-09-07 01:32:18 Among the financial stocks, Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup fell 1.5–1.7%, while @Visa gained 1.3%.
6345 2018-09-07 01:31:51 biotech stocks also saw weakness as @Celgene fell 2.5%, @AbbVie dropped 1.5% and @Amgen eased 0.8%.
6346 2018-09-07 01:31:33 Trump is a wall street man. He wont do anything for real Americans as long as his personal stocks soar.
6347 2018-09-07 01:30:15 US stocks mostly fell on Thursday as the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ finished lower for a third session due to mounting concerns about contagion from a handful of struggling emerging economies on top of unresolved trade tension
6348 2018-09-07 01:30:02 I don't think about financial success as the measurement of my success. trade forex stocks
6349 2018-09-07 01:29:18 Sadly no, I have no idea why. Just a China town... but a quick google and one of the big supermarket chain stocks it.
6350 2018-09-07 01:28:25 Dan - Don't mix your political bias with stocks. Buy this dip. This will have ZERO impact on their market share in North America which is only 41% of the business. Rest of the world doesn't care about this issue. Rather they will get inspired by underlying message.

6354 2018-09-07 01:24:47 I think Target stocks Tim Tams (at least the one at City Point in Brooklyn does) and it has changed my life for the better
6355 2018-09-07 01:23:52 Nike stocks are down right now...I personally hope that continues but remember, Americans generally have very short memories, maybe this calculated risk will pay off for Nike. I’ve purchased my last Nike apparel and haven’t watched an NFL game in 2 years...Time will tell #boycott
6356 2018-09-07 01:22:23 I'm starting to believe you don't know how stocks work. Nike lost 4% in 1 day of trading in Feb. Guess what, no one gives a shit about that day. As of today, Nike is down .88% for past 7 days. No one gives a shit. They've already moved on and the 3% is irrelevant now.
6357 2018-09-07 01:22:08 I’m going to start investing in stocks when I graduate.
6358 2018-09-07 01:21:30 If you dont have stocks bonds and Ms stop calling ppl broke cause you can't afford tp keep a G in the bank? ... so if you die tomorrow you can afford the hole you go in  in the ground 
6359 2018-09-07 01:20:53 Really liked watching $BONTQ , $BLSP and $IDNG today. Huge  moves today.. I think there is a LOT more to come.  $PSIQ low volume today but by far one of my favorite low float #MJ stocks and looking forward to big things this fall season

why are you down two stocks
6362 2018-09-07 01:20:39 No, Its a pain. So I do $gbtc and crypto related stocks, they all follow each other. Blockchain too!
6363 2018-09-07 01:19:26 My life on any website. Be it clothes or shoes. Why is it no company ever stocks shoes aver a size 11!!
6364 2018-09-07 01:18:33 I'd also like to mention @LOCKERPROJECTME. They're an amazing nonprofit that stocks food pantries in schools throughout Maine and they take donations of any kind. Dry/canned goods, toiletries, clothing, etc. Consider donating if you can 
6365 2018-09-07 01:18:09 Isn't a month too long a period to use in formulating an opinion on stocks? I mean, a month is sometimes as long as 31 days.
6366 2018-09-07 01:16:49 I will tell you there are parents that are abusing their children from belts stocks, chains, paddles, hand, there are child abuse our there and spouse abuse, It must stop,
6367 2018-09-07 01:15:47 It’s time 2tax the church. When they care more about their pharmaceutical stocks than their members getting addicted 2opioids &dying it proves they only care about money. How can anyone believe what the Mormon church says? Read the CES letter, check out ex Mormons blog on Reddit
6368 2018-09-07 01:15:43 Look interesting. I will look at this compagny for share of stocks
6369 2018-09-07 01:14:59 Umm... is it just me or does this video have almost nothing to do with Uranium? You talked about gold stocks the whole time. False advertising.
6370 2018-09-07 01:14:46 oh... is it while stocks last....?

6377 2018-09-07 01:12:22 Damn, I am glad I have no money in Nike stocks
6378 2018-09-07 01:12:15 There’s no money in stocks #youshouldbetrading
6379 2018-09-07 01:11:03 We are seeing moves from what I would call “too big to fail” pharma. Momentum behind these stocks steamrolls. I want to sell calls on $MRK and $CVS for profit then roll back to Sep 28th calls. $PFE is a buy on dips imo. GENERAL MEDS are more valuable when global volatility exists
6380 2018-09-07 01:10:21 Not when your president starts and ends his days with lies to America and the world.  PS- Underemployment is a MAJOR issue in the US.  The stock market is down and over 50% of Americans don't own stocks or a retirement account.

6382 2018-09-07 01:09:21 Same variety? Had 233 beside 255 in same field. 255 had brown stocks, lodged a bit, kinda twisted and was 0.5 mph slower than the 233 that had green stems but standing perfect.
6383 2018-09-07 01:08:06 Oh, and sorry. That response was for @futures.
6384 2018-09-07 01:07:41 You know investments don’t always go good. If one person’s making money on stocks or commodities someone else is losing it. If you live 40 years you’re guaranteed to quadruple the amount. Only way you beat that is if you find the new apple at a couple bucks a share.
6385 2018-09-07 01:07:17 Then, you should be looking at Trump and his administration and scam of “tax cuts,” with more coming..and, recognize that trickle down economics don’t work, never have. You must invest in communities at lower levels, because each dollar spent generates  more returns.
6386 2018-09-07 01:07:09 Keep your eyes on Sunpharma and Reliance stocks, Both can perform well for intraday.
Best of Luck 
6387 2018-09-07 01:07:00 Wow, so they went back and classified stocks historically? Andrew, is this the data you are using? Curious if Andrew found it didn't work before 1999?

6390 2018-09-07 01:04:15 I make real time recommendations before stocks move following dark pool prints. Check out 5 years of YouTube videos, proof speaks for itself
6391 2018-09-07 01:03:35 And, thanks, I have several investment “vehicles,” and not just the stock market.
6392 2018-09-07 01:02:48 So you think those stocks dropped yesterday and today because of Alex Jones?? Look at the market in general genius.
6393 2018-09-07 01:02:47 ...wages have declined and inflation grown at faster rate. Oh, and yeah. While the oRange Chimp touts “great economy, best ever,” he turns around and states, “we can’t give raises to federal employees in these desperate or poor economic conditions.” But, yeah, MAGA
6394 2018-09-07 01:02:38 Yea your right ct does not need taxs cut or more jobs

Walk away Dennis . Don't listen to the scam the media is pushing. 

Fact is Stocks are up . Jobs are back.. economy is booming.  I have more $$ in my check. 

And your still crying
6395 2018-09-07 01:02:03 He is worth 126 MILLION in net worth and who knows how much he’s going to leech off of Nike. He doesn’t need to worry about putting food on the table and he’s all ready costed Nike 5 BILLION in stocks. @Kaepernick7
6396 2018-09-07 01:02:02 Caught in the wrong stocks today $FMG $CGF shorts getting squeezed despite market red. Not a good sign for the Catters tonight
6397 2018-09-07 01:01:12 Yeah. Interesting how so many believe Trump just came on board and it was sunshine and light, he brought us down from the HEIGHTS OF UNASSAILABLE UNEMPLOYMENT by all of 1%? Trade deficit has INCREASED, we have incurred greater debt and borrowed money much earlier, and real..
6398 2018-09-07 00:59:50 The name’s Scaramucci, and I rock the stocks bro, I’m half Gordon Gecko and a third Joe Piscapo, I’m the Wall Street douche, from New York City, when I’m on tv, you’re the fool I pity.
6399 2018-09-07 00:59:09 Dude, I'm sorry your stocks crashed. It certainly feels permanent. I have two weeks to find a job or I get involuntarily placed with a volunteer assignment to keep my food subsidy.
6400 2018-09-07 00:58:45 Cheap stocks getting cheaper. Ugly for the high Beta stocks
6401 2018-09-07 00:58:42 If it were up to me. I’d force him to go look at the dead children and secretly film it. Also public stocks and rotten fruit to throw works too.
6402 2018-09-07 00:58:24 Yep when your stocks goes up. That's a bad thing.
6403 2018-09-07 00:58:14 I can introduce you to my mentor. He is not intro stocks but into forex and binary options which are more profitable options.
6404 2018-09-07 00:57:39 Investor overreaction, this time on the negative outlook for stocks, resulted in the majority missing the stock market opportunity. Another overreaction was also taking place concurrently with the blacklisting of stocks.
6405 2018-09-07 00:56:10 How does one buy stocks? I want to get @Nike stocks. Looking for simple and easy way to Just Do It #JustDolt @NikeRunning #nikeplus
6406 2018-09-07 00:55:35 No need to respond to this joke actually. If they want to do it anyway, they would be laughing stocks.
6407 2018-09-07 00:54:28 doing my part for the liberal cause by investing $100,000 in weed stocks.
6408 2018-09-07 00:53:16 Yes, I like that post from you Corey, cuz now u cain't get Turner/Whitcomb for cheap at all. Both of their stocks sky rocket during the playoffs. I know the Mercury is not giving up Turner unless they can get 2 younger players for her. It makes sense. Storm is not giving up
6409 2018-09-07 00:52:47 Omg im buying stocks in Nike as we speak !!!!!!
6410 2018-09-07 00:52:16 Just started following @KAFChi18 and the @Cubs commentary is as good as any on twitter, maybe even you @ESPNChiCubs. Worth a follow. #EverybodyIn. 
Back to the game and resource stocks.
6411 2018-09-07 00:51:44 I use the 2 monitors on the left for trading charts and scanners, and the laptop monitor on the left as my trading.  I have 2 other monitors I leave for charts of the $SPY and stocks I'm only sort of watching.  The 2 monitors and laptop center are for business 
6412 2018-09-07 00:51:38 hilarious they refuse to zoom out and show the BTC rise from last year. it's like showing the Downtown on a 300 point drop in 1 day and declaring a massacre in stocks when they market is up 5% in a year.
6413 2018-09-07 00:50:49 not to have a better record than 2018. Also, Coach Laimbeer first year with expansion Aces has a lot to do with Amber Stocks firing for sure. Cuz the Aces won 8 more games than last year and Sky only won 1 more game than last year. So I saw that coming before the 2019 season
6414 2018-09-07 00:50:27 LadyHawks vs Highland Regional tomorrow night at 7pm!!!!  Come support the Lady Hawks and buy a STOCKS POUND CAKE for only $15.  The best pound cake out there!!!

6419 2018-09-07 00:44:26 Disagree.  It's a stair step up in stocks and BTC recently and  a elevator in free fall on the way down.  Also how do you reconcile the fact that we lost several hundred dollars BEFORE the GS news was released?  Front run much?

6435 2018-09-07 00:32:27 With due respect there will be mean reversion on the momentum effect where 10 stocks in the SP 500 drove 122% if performance...then Smart Beta which has a value tilt will re-emerge
6436 2018-09-07 00:32:18 Of course, they enter federal detention facilities/prisons that are privately run-watch those stocks contributions to the GOP.  Let’s lock up, pretty much on the whole, innocent people get paid to do it. Profit over freedom destroying lives which = crimes against humanity
6437 2018-09-07 00:31:58 If UFC is public then tell me where you can buy the stock? You are so smart that you are the only one who knows they are a public company.  You do know about stocks right? I swear the more you talk the dumber you sound fam. 
6438 2018-09-07 00:31:45 The best thing about these Canadian weed stocks is all the happy stoners finally walking around with big $$$. Congrats to everyone that got in early.
6439 2018-09-07 00:31:20 $XLK $XLY $XLC rebalance 9/21 AMC. I'm thinking some stink bids might hit after 4P. Same logic applies to $FB $NFLX $GOOGL etc. Remaining $XLK stocks like $AAPL $MSFT will get $ reallocated. Because of the size of $ sloshing around & relative size of $XLK to $XLC, could be opps.

6443 2018-09-07 00:27:57 It remains the gold standard with a few modifications like bump stocks.
6444 2018-09-07 00:26:24 buy Chrin stocks.
6445 2018-09-07 00:24:12 Duh, she don’t have to answer to anyone. She has the majority of stocks. It’s a tv show, why trump got to be involved. Not everything is about trump. Steffy take charge like your namesake. Let ho Logans know who run Forresters Creations.
6446 2018-09-07 00:24:12 All is well , 
On the cheese subject, more then 3/4 of prices on dairy 2nd transformation is on stocks , distribution and retail 
They make good margins at that level 
Have a good evening
6447 2018-09-07 00:23:56 So answer the original question. Who else’s stocks dipped that much yesterday?
6448 2018-09-07 00:23:29 All pot stocks on fire except arora cannabis. Is there a reason why ??$ACBFF @WolfOfWeedST @InvestorsLive @timseymour
6449 2018-09-07 00:22:34 Bonds are usually less volatile than stocks so are more conservative. Many chased yield when rates were super low should begin to look for a good entry point to return to bonds.  Both have potential downsides (rates could rise/bond prices fall) but equities are very overvalued
6450 2018-09-07 00:21:36 Unlikely. The biggest dividend paying stocks are those with government ownership.  That is very important revenue to governments
6451 2018-09-07 00:21:34 @akaykenannn that what I am here for too I get so many emails about Top 10 Stock Picks these stocks be in those picks
6452 2018-09-07 00:20:19 I need somebody to teach me how to buy stocks like ASAP

F 4 this trade
6454 2018-09-07 00:18:06 Btw what are them nature stocks called?
6455 2018-09-07 00:17:52 We use #ai #quant #factor models to find investment opportunities globally - that gives you the background for our take on $YUMC.  The #stock has been a top buy in our #china model for 2 to 3 mos.  Probably worth considering if you trade #EmergingMarkets #stocks
6456 2018-09-07 00:17:02 Global Warming will soon bring the Oceans of the world to a tipping point in terms of PH.  Corals are already dying. Fish stocks are depleting, and migrating to new areas. Catch yields are decreasing and markets are expanding to "Over" fish quotes . Too many people & fossil fuels
6457 2018-09-07 00:16:30 And why should there be a limit to how much ammo a person can own? I thought only Nazi Germany did that before taking them away altogether from the Jews. Types of weapons is different. Machine guns and bump stocks really serve no practical purpose.
6458 2018-09-07 00:15:51 definitely keep up w it on apps and invest in more than one...sometimes even ur bank will have ways to buy and trade stocks as well as keep up with them. i’m honestly right there w ya just now learning how to do it myself!

6461 2018-09-07 00:13:48 In my opinion, the recent BTC dump was a well planned well timed orchestrated manipulation to take advantage of the stop-loss and shorts options, just like it happens in stocks but not a prevalent. Big money controls everything and as long as the crypto space is not regulated..?
6462 2018-09-07 00:13:26 What do we have to cry about our guy is in the white house, the economy is thriving, stocks are at all time highs. And u snowflakes are doing anything and everything to derail the administration (WITHOUT ANY LUCK). So like I said what do we have to cry about? Lol.

6471 2018-09-07 00:09:38 Asia stocks extend on losses after another weak US lead where weakness in tech and energy weighed on the majors, with sentiment cautious ahead of the tariff deadline and NFPs, while Trump also hinted Japan could be next; ASX 200 (-0.6%), Nikkei 225 (-0.9%), KOSPI (-0.6%)

6475 2018-09-07 00:07:45 @Sambong $SFIX A good example of what's happening here. It's all about which stocks. Not the easiest market last two days.
