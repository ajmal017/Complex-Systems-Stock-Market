8 2018-09-06 23:54:27 They have INVESTORS they have 2 answer 2 & their stocks have been taking a nosedive. SOME Dems STILL believe in the 1st Amendment 4 all! Twitter’s stock holders won’t like their shares going down in value. If it was a LIB I’m SURE UR backassword opinion would b different!
9 2018-09-06 23:53:29 On the contrary.. he is asking a great job with economy ,legal immigration,, stocks ... so many other things!
10 2018-09-06 23:52:35 Not sure what to root for.
U prices stabilize or go down will almost ensure a“positive” 232 outcome
On the other hand, U stocks should go up if and when U prices show a significant rise.
11 2018-09-06 23:51:58 Nah, she was hinting to sell stocks. They went down over 1%
12 2018-09-06 23:51:57 I found out about @RSVPKINGZ after getting tired of dealing with bots destroy the Yeezy stocks I decided if I can’t win them; join them. After a quick google search the Kingz seemed to be the best and most reputable ATC. After my first cook 2 years ago I was hooked. #COOKSZN
13 2018-09-06 23:51:48 Maybe I wasn't clear.  It was Eisenhower's fault Vet's were in Vietnam. This bc he hadn't ended the draft like he sad he wld.  Nixon doesn't get credit for containing draft after it expired.
14 2018-09-06 23:51:27 All athletic apparel stocks were down mainly bc of NAFTA. Try doing research and think before you make incoherent points.
15 2018-09-06 23:50:49 Yeah, amazing how MAGAts are all doing so “great.” As I said, one of Trump’s sycophants, desperate to prove you have worth on an anonymous twitter page to an anonymous person. Trying so hard to convince strangers you are “winning.” So incredibly sad.
16 2018-09-06 23:50:29 Diversification is essential. Do your thing girl. Little by little. I started investing cents on the stocks.

A bag with a bag in it

49 2018-09-06 23:40:04 Nike trying to put on a big show as their stocks nosedive!! Let's see what they're stockholders say as more of us boycott !!
50 2018-09-06 23:38:53 If you can afford it consider buying stocks in Nike.
51 2018-09-06 23:38:52 The point is there are many owners for which the CEO is making decisions for—People buy stocks to make money.   If the CEO consistently makes decisions that limit their growth, they are shirking their responsibility to the other owners
52 2018-09-06 23:38:51 The draft BH the draft
53 2018-09-06 23:38:08 Yeah sell your Nike stocks and no more shopping for Nikes
54 2018-09-06 23:37:40 Every now and then my work stocks the vending machinese with cinnabon gooey bites which are my favorite at work. My greedy ass bought all 3 to hoard them. Dumb part is that I live right next to a mall which has a Cinnabon in it

57 2018-09-06 23:35:50 And yet I benefited....sorry you don't have a decent enough of a job to see the benefits of people having more of their own money to keep. I earned my money for me and my family. Not for you to steal it and splurge on your wants.
58 2018-09-06 23:34:38 Except for the part where 50% of tax filers paid 97.2% of all income tax while the bottom 50% paid a whopping 2.8%. Kinda hard to share anything when 1 group is being forced to carry the entire load.
59 2018-09-06 23:34:30 You’re the one 
60 2018-09-06 23:32:37 @TheHPdude based on what? 
What is your bull thesis?  I’m bullish on real weed stocks like $APH.CA and $WEED.CA
61 2018-09-06 23:32:28 That is a lie. People threaten to kill the president , and you think that’s ok? Really Twitter you are disgusting! Leaving twitter , just like I left Facebook. Look at their stocks !
62 2018-09-06 23:32:08 MTA collects money does it not? That money is for salaries, maintenance and repair. Where's the money?
63 2018-09-06 23:32:03 It may not be the stocks... But something is definitely up.


64 2018-09-06 23:31:07 RE: Nike . Buy stocks not socks.  #ProTip
65 2018-09-06 23:30:52 You worked so hard to make possible and easy to us invest in stocks that this award is just the beginning of many. Congratulations and thanks from your customers
66 2018-09-06 23:28:22 @washingtonpost wanna tell you; Trump saying; our GDP is Great. We Are Kicking butt. That's a Whistle; to the Rich. If you don't have, Stocks,Bonds and Money. It don't reply to you. The rich ppl put him in. Income in Inequality. We are 23 out of 30. US; being RICHEST COUNTRY=Sad
67 2018-09-06 23:28:19 I follow a few people on here who have good stock ideas. The penny stocks are difficult I try and go for the safest ones lol
68 2018-09-06 23:28:17 The only area @EddieEdwardsNH disagrees with Trump on is… bump stocks? But @SenatorSanborn’s behavior is too inappropriate for Edwards to support him? #nhpolitics #nh01
69 2018-09-06 23:28:08 No you talked about the bubble. Now you're quoting stocks. You can't have it both ways. I am giving up. I can't tell up from down with you.

71 2018-09-06 23:27:46 “The only thing I disagree with the President about is bump stocks,” says Eddie Edwards.
72 2018-09-06 23:27:31 Some of the more defensive stock sectors have been attracting money of late. But while a 5% or so pullback is a possibility, have some cash on hand to add to Growth stocks not RUST ( Real Estate, Utilities, Staples, Telecom)...no one wants Rust in their investment portfolio!
73 2018-09-06 23:27:27 What's everyone's opinion on the new Nike Ad and their sponsoring of Kaepernick? Imo, it's extremely inspiring and I think Nike have put themselves on the right side of history. They also knew this would generate publicity but it's a shame their stocks are tanking.
74 2018-09-06 23:27:09 $UVXY That's a lot of work for 4.55% I'm still finding it much more profitable to be long on the right stocks.  It's a bull market.  :) $SPY
75 2018-09-06 23:26:30 I've been in stocks before...NBD 
76 2018-09-06 23:26:14 Mike stocks up again today Cheeto Head. Isn't that the bottom line with you boys? 
Looks like you're the one whose stock is headed down. How those new polls treatin' you?
77 2018-09-06 23:25:50 we seen how Nike stocks fell, so will NFL ratings again.  i read just yesterday, i like him, but i amsure lots and lots of people do not like Peyton Manning, but the NFL said the reson NFL ratings are low is because Manning is not there anymore.  Don't think so --we know why
78 2018-09-06 23:25:46 As these senators use inside information to rig the stocks they invest in ... filling up their corrupt pockets. This is not the senate of MY country OUT WITH THE CORRUPT SENATORS! IN WITH SOME FRESH BLOOD....FOR THE PEOPLE!!!!
79 2018-09-06 23:23:24 I fly helicopters when not researching stocks or cryptocurrencies!
80 2018-09-06 23:22:48 Move the semi auto up to full auto class. You don't have to worry about bump stocks......
81 2018-09-06 23:21:59 the people who crusade moral panics and destroy other peoples lives are the laughing stocks of hell.

86 2018-09-06 23:20:28 Could also check out tours of conservation facilities...e.g. Mactaquac biodiversity facility (Atlantic salmon--few interesting stocks like Inner Bay of Fundy salmon & projects using live gene bank!).
87 2018-09-06 23:20:18 I’m in the same boat @ savestacks started with 5k ,then added to 10k, 4 years later up to 117k with 47 cannabis stocks . Move that profit around . 
88 2018-09-06 23:19:53 While it's unfortunate that the 51 Super Select isn't happening, the @CARSTour is hoping to make a last ditch effort to get some of those Super Late Model teams over to @OCS_Track for tomorrow's doubleheader with the Late Model Stocks.
89 2018-09-06 23:18:59 Oh snap!
90 2018-09-06 23:18:13 Tell us about 911 again!
91 2018-09-06 23:16:50 I think I wanna invest in Nike stocks
92 2018-09-06 23:15:51 Tick tick, tick tick clock runs out..
93 2018-09-06 23:15:18 Im so glad to see people buying Nike products more and more in support to the cause , thanks for helping the NIKE stocks rise  #justbuyit 
94 2018-09-06 23:15:06 I expect Twitter’s stocks will drop another 5% tomorrow. Not a good news for shareholders.

99 2018-09-06 23:12:57 My favourite part of this fiasco is how people are pretending like they have Nike stocks to sell. That, and how Under Armor are taking over the market.
100 2018-09-06 23:11:08 For the love of Pete. You’ve NO fucking clue. Try living here. Children. Then house, daily living expenses. Most in our hood don’t know how to use a lawnmower. The  doesn’t go far. I’d say no time to look at stocks or like most thinks he’s gonna live to 100.

111 2018-09-06 23:05:06 It's not always easy to do what's not popular, but that's where you make your money. Buy stocks that look bad to less careful investors and hang on until their real value is recognized.
112 2018-09-06 23:04:53 Try Forbidden Planet . My Glasgow store stocks them.
113 2018-09-06 23:04:12 Yet they surely planned on covering AR-15s and bump stocks in the 2nd Amendment, right? #GOPTraitors must have been replaced by Putin’s secret Stepford Wives clones because I can’t honestly fathom that they believe what they say or that decent humans believe what they say ...
114 2018-09-06 23:04:10 It's like when people don't go to prison for endangering lives of millions, but the book gets thrown at them if they make some rich guy's stocks drop.

119 2018-09-06 23:01:18 I will gladly contribute some of my annual taxes I pay to support a 700 billion defense budget so all the rich people stocks stay high if u will contribute to affordable health insurance. I am more scared of pre-existing condition killing me than NK.

122 2018-09-06 22:59:30 They are never going to crack down on bots because their stocks would drop very quickly if they admitted to shareholders and advertisers how many real people *actually* use Twitter. It’s too bad for those of us that like the app for the most part.
123 2018-09-06 22:59:25 Thanks to @DaveRamsey I don’t buy single stocks. But if I did, @Nike would have made me rich this week. #toomuchrisk

128 2018-09-06 22:55:08 September is typically the worst month for stocks.... September 2018 has been the worst month for stocks, for me, ever!!!!!  It's only 6 days in 
129 2018-09-06 22:54:53 The S&P500 & Nasdaq declined as more US tariffs on Chinese imports loomed, while tech stocks stumbled, led by chipmakers & concerns about increased regulation of social media companies. Ahead of the local open SPI futures are 25 points lower at 6,120. #ausshares #stockmarket
130 2018-09-06 22:54:50 So you think should buy pot stocks now?

132 2018-09-06 22:53:17 But waiting for stocks from 3 months is painful
133 2018-09-06 22:53:01 What? The only reason the stocks dropped yesterday was because it was labor day weekend. Historically stocks drop that week. Your protest aren't doing shit.

137 2018-09-06 22:51:32 We're not too far off seeing those bottoms again. Monthly and weekly RSI on a few stocks are showing they're oversold or close to it.
138 2018-09-06 22:49:03 No I rarely buy individual stocks. I’m an index fund guy
139 2018-09-06 22:48:40 Did you followup that conversation with a lesson on economics and how stocks really work?
140 2018-09-06 22:47:34 Elon needs to keep talking shit so I can afford more Tesla stocks
141 2018-09-06 22:46:15 @victorytrader88 I own stocks in PBR and I'm a little confused that they are 3.5% up in after market. Does the market dislike bolsonaro? It seems that way and I thought they liked him more than a leftist as ciro or hadad.
142 2018-09-06 22:45:55 The stocks for Tin Foils just dropped harder than Nike’s (for like an hour).
143 2018-09-06 22:45:45 Does this couple have anything of value that can be auctioned off?  House, car, jewelry?  Or perhaps stocks, bonds, IRA?
144 2018-09-06 22:45:35 looks nice. I think next week we get a lot more green out of the market, but who really knows. stocks like $PEP $PG $KO $COST can survive market turmoil.
145 2018-09-06 22:45:03 I can't wait to purchase #NIKE stocks!!! #NikeBoycott
146 2018-09-06 22:44:36 Hi, Yousuf. We have no specific date to provide but you may select "Notify Me" on the order page so that you will receive an email once stocks are available. Thanks for your interest.
147 2018-09-06 22:44:23 And, the so-called tax cuts were for the elite, not for ordinary citizens. So, let’s not go there as it validates my point above
148 2018-09-06 22:44:13 I made money doing bitcoin and sold out before the looooong dip. My next move is investing in stocks. Who wants to join me and start a group to keep each other motivated?
149 2018-09-06 22:43:56 I had the opportunity to buy canopy in single digits but thought the valuation was frothy even then. All these pot stocks trading at PS >100 will endure years of down or sideways consolidation when the legalization euphoria settles
150 2018-09-06 22:43:55 In a short, in addition to the fundamental case you also need a stock market vulnerability- $TSLA likely has it in the form of @elonmusk 's pledged shares. Brokers show no restraint in selling pledged shares-check out $BHC and #HKSE closely held stocks exposed by shorts. $TSLAQ
151 2018-09-06 22:43:51 Insurance companies in kahoots with PBMs enabled by safe harbor that keeps them free from punishment for racketeering in rebate/kickback/pay2play scheme-theft from taxpayers,harms patients,causes drug shortages and is 30-50% of drug costs. This must end.
152 2018-09-06 22:41:16 This guy was saying buy financial stocks the week before the market collapse in late 2007.  Enough said.
153 2018-09-06 22:40:59 I understand where the Eagles QB stocks are at, and the nature of preseasons. But I can’t have any piece of an ATL squad that scored 27 points over 4 preseason games.
154 2018-09-06 22:40:57 I am trying to work on understanding options. Put my small amt I have left in long term stocks. Lots of reading but not sure of where point A is to try to find point B lol
155 2018-09-06 22:40:43 I’m very serious I just don’t know much about stocks or investments
156 2018-09-06 22:40:30 These are the 5 stocks in finance sector that yesterday made all-time highs:
$AON, $ORI, $BRO, $ROL, $AJG
157 2018-09-06 22:40:29  Found these #stocks that made record highs: $ANDV, $MPC
158 2018-09-06 22:40:29 @CoryBooker Yes. Corey if you had told me 4 years ago what’s happening in our country now yes,I would have said its fiction. 4.2% growth, boomkng stocks, more money in my paycheck,ISIS gone, border and country safe etc. etc. @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @seanhannity
159 2018-09-06 22:40:17 It was shown on the news today 09/06/18 that Nike stocks were rising. Only time will tell how this will play out. Too soon to call it either way, in my opinion
160 2018-09-06 22:39:01 Thats always been an interesting question to me, especially since 3 stocks is an effective ruleset. If I had to guess it's because spacie matches hit so hard that having 4 stocks means both players get more game time, allowing a volatile matchup to become slightly more consistent

162 2018-09-06 22:36:09 I need somebody to teach me how to invest in stocks 
163 2018-09-06 22:36:00 I was using Raging Bull a while ago, they do biostocks but I don’t really mess with them too much now. I prefer mid/large caps across all sectors. I was kinda big on oil/gas stocks once upon a time too.
164 2018-09-06 22:35:29 Boob trapped economy while inflation falsely blossoms around new comers stocks failures ratings dive wiki leaks Post traumatic stressed out Postman disorder  - gone fishing shields cause . Know it all duh capes capes capes grapes
165 2018-09-06 22:35:01 Neither of those two mentioned I would consider blue chip... more like cow chip stocks. :D
166 2018-09-06 22:34:51 If you're of the right money, status, and politics---You can literally threaten to murder people on here and get away with it. There are massive instances of people threatening others that get to just walk away. Twitter is a trash fire & their stocks reflect it.
167 2018-09-06 22:34:09 Yea that’ doesn’t make sense so stock brokers don’t have that info when they’re reselling stocks ?
168 2018-09-06 22:33:19 So how many times in my 30 year career have I been told that real estate investing  is so much safer than investing in stocks? Imagine owning a condo you have subsidize cause the rent won’t cover the payments, you cannot sell and interest rates are going up. Worry much?
169 2018-09-06 22:33:06 Same here!  Will give us a lot more stocks to trade when that program ends!
170 2018-09-06 22:32:08 When you guys pump stocks Have you took positions If so you’re no better
171 2018-09-06 22:31:09 The problem is, Plaid Cymru doesn't have the conveyor belt of new mugs to get put in the stocks that Westminster does. The bitterness in Ceredigion lost a parliamentary seat and a generation of activists. It's taken a decade to get past the worst of that.
172 2018-09-06 22:31:00 I made 18 cents on my stocks hello world I’m moving up
173 2018-09-06 22:30:58 You are on fire man. Keep it up. @stockswami - a must follow if you follow #ASX stocks.
174 2018-09-06 22:29:56 So if you knew someone Connected to Wall Street and they told you you better sell off your stocks or you will lose it all. Would you ignore that or seek them off?
175 2018-09-06 22:28:24 I'm starting to really get my investment portfolio set up. The current goal is to be able to make 10% of income passively. The current strategy is to invest money in stocks/ETFs and p2p lending services like lending club. I'm implementing this for a year and seeing what happens.
176 2018-09-06 22:26:31 I focus on tech stocks currently so FANG and a few others... I don't typically scan for random stocks to find plays.
177 2018-09-06 22:25:49 In other news: Tinfoil Hat stocks plummet.
178 2018-09-06 22:25:46 Here's the thing. I'm starting to just wish that every character could do that. It'd be cool to be Bayo, screen wide combos would be something normal, we'd have more stocks to play with, etc. But looking at this in current Sm4sh, it's silly.
179 2018-09-06 22:25:37 Stocks diving, people burning their nike products and shaming the add with real sacrifice.  Yea, checkmate
180 2018-09-06 22:25:28 The stocks will crash when it's figured out.
181 2018-09-06 22:24:41 Ask as many as you'd like... Yes, a person can certainly be better at trading options vs stocks. It's mainly your preference and how hard you're willing to dedicate yourself to understanding the game..
182 2018-09-06 22:24:12 good point. I would argue that it helped unlock value since all three stocks are doing great on their own. The value is somehow just not flowing back in the parent's stock, especially in $YY $SINA.  Efforts by Sina to reduce the discount by buying back shares hasnt worked either
183 2018-09-06 22:24:11 And it’s true I work at foot locker where they sell nikes and nike don’t even own it’s stocks only the shareholders do lol 
184 2018-09-06 22:23:58 Tomorrow's NFP #'s TBD can't anticipate  but a PB in the Tech stocks might be good for Window dressing (last week of Sept) positioning for an up move....

187 2018-09-06 22:22:55 Well you got to realise you are comparing two different climates in these 2 markets. Longterm NQ obviously bullish, BTC bearish. Right now we are seeing a rotation out of tech stocks. As long as we dont lose 7365ish on high TF I will try to long NQ.
188 2018-09-06 22:22:45 It wasn't his stockbroker, for one. He paid him cash for information that isn't public. It's illegal and he knew it was and he still did it. It makes things unfair for the every day Joe. Say he knows a company is gunna shut down but it isn't public. Sells the stocks to
189 2018-09-06 22:22:40 Thanks. Picked them up in House of Fraser. Get a pair, while stocks last.  
190 2018-09-06 22:22:17 Is there a cap on questions? If so, the previous one doesn’t count feel free not to answer. Do you think that you could be better at playing options vs stocks with the right risk management and knowing when to cap it?
191 2018-09-06 22:21:41 Charge for illegally trading stocks > charge for illegally trading punches? - Inquiring wives/girlfriends want to know.
192 2018-09-06 22:21:19 Micron, Western Digital and chip-equipment stocks are hit hard on concerns of falling Flash prices.
193 2018-09-06 22:20:50 I do some of them, I made a bunch on VSTM & VKTX a few weeks back. The weed stocks been the ones to play recently.
194 2018-09-06 22:19:38 I find it funny that people dont know who stocks it.  its not like it fills its self.  a simple camera will fix that.
195 2018-09-06 22:19:38 Lol, do you know how to read stocks?
196 2018-09-06 22:19:29 I do a lot with short puts in mj stocks. Premiums are so rich because of the ultra high IV and margin required is so low. Of course it has its risks that have to be managed. I would not advice to sell naked puts at the top  Made good money during the summer sideways lull.

198 2018-09-06 22:19:22 This is  hot stuff, reporting on behalf of  CNBC with your local business news. The Left Wings are pushing legislation that could impact the future shares of  K stocks. Thank you for tuning into  CNBC.

200 2018-09-06 22:18:10 Isn't inflation ahead of wages right now. A "roaring economy & record stocks" are only helpful to a subsection of Americans. Most are worse off right now.

205 2018-09-06 22:16:55 It wont happen to them. Prepare a GAB acct. We're all going to get the hammer b4 Nov.. @POTUS should make one. Even the Left would follow lmaoooo then stocks will tank.
206 2018-09-06 22:16:41 However, the moral and ethical turpitude of our elected leaders is getting worse.  Is it positive to trade our integrity and character for cash?  For stocks?
207 2018-09-06 22:16:15 $KLL clarification doesn't read well in my opinion. Co was talkn about a reserve in Aug preso (23yr res?? Pg10) it looks like from recent study they don't have a reserve anymore.. Only a sml measured and indicated resource.. Which is a downgrade.. #potash $kll $apc #asx #stocks

211 2018-09-06 22:14:28 @TwitterSafety I hold your stocks in my portfolio since 2013 despite being one of the worst social media stock after @Snapchat.  I have come to realize that you are waging a war against free speech. Maybe it time to sell and encourage other investors to do so.#infowars #AlexJones

214 2018-09-06 22:13:33 most stocks follow the market which has been in a slide lately. so the quick drop from 75 to 74 in price of CVS made me think it will go down further. good to know the volatility of lower priced options. Thanks
215 2018-09-06 22:13:30 mostly...I only do small cap pharmaceutical penny stocks when they have an FDA meeting and get approval..then I'll scoop up some shares and wait for the spike and then sell it before the pull back

217 2018-09-06 22:13:10 I’m not doing it, probably the dumbest idea I’ve ever had. Will go with stocks or something
218 2018-09-06 22:13:08 Link to confirmation that central banks' top holdings are tech stocks? In fact, the Fed is legally precluded from buying stocks, they can only buy government securities unless part of a federal bailout.

221 2018-09-06 22:12:45 If your a pensioner and invest in volatile stocks like oil.. you did not get good advice... or you can afford to lose $
Only other reason for a pensioner to invest in risky stocks, is your not too smart.
222 2018-09-06 22:11:47 is that why Twitter's stocks are the ones plummeting after reality hit?
223 2018-09-06 22:11:36 Great. I don't care if @Nike doesn't care. I'm sure the Portland people can manage a few less latte's per week, right? And a cut in pay? And declining stocks? Yes, because it's not about the $ after all.
224 2018-09-06 22:10:33 You have to look at the timing of acquisition of stocks. They were not acquired months or years ago. They were required around the time all their stocks began correcting. Which amounts to a bailout of the market by propping up stock price.
225 2018-09-06 22:09:57 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
226 2018-09-06 22:09:38 In all seriousness, invest in Nike stocks this weekish. If the trend follows, they will hit a new high in about two weeks.

230 2018-09-06 22:07:16 Going to start working into more multi day swings on $SPX has great success early in the year. Fighting short term chop can be mentally draining . I’ll be diving into other stocks as well in some of the bigger names. Hope everyone made some money today. I’ll recap & chart tonight
231 2018-09-06 22:06:26 I will not watch any disgusting NFL players games. I am a Vietnam veteran, a soldier who did my job protecting South Vietnam. Even though I could not wear my uniform home. I have always respected our flag and stand of our national anthem. Nike stocks sold two days ago
232 2018-09-06 22:05:53 This.  Just because generics exist doesn't mean $CELG won't make money.  Also revlimid is being tested to treat other problems in combinations with therapy.  So runways can open up.  And it's FPE are significantly lower than the broader market.  So it's less risk than most stocks

240 2018-09-06 22:01:22 Anyone who owned whatever stock he was trading. Anyone who's IRA, 401k, or mutual funds included those stocks. People always complain white collar crimes go unpunished, but are sticking up for him and I don't get it.

246 2018-09-06 21:57:00 Does he have stocks in the funeral industry, too? Imagine running a crematorium for a miscarriage or paying for a 5K casket for an aborted fetus. Oh, please.
247 2018-09-06 21:56:47 is he gaming stocks again
248 2018-09-06 21:56:47 I just looked at the cost of that on a website and it's 274 for 30 day supply...How the hell is it over 1k?
249 2018-09-06 21:56:14 Pointing out what about it? That it had a normal drop like any stock does occasionally? Lol if you had even the most basic knowledge of stocks you would've known it wasn't a big deal as people are making it
250 2018-09-06 21:55:51 Mine, too! I usually have a rule not to buy stocks that are already close to their 52 week high and but I made an exception this time.  
251 2018-09-06 21:55:38 FU, creep. Freeloaders are people like you.
252 2018-09-06 21:55:36 Si! Funciona. Ya que la estrategia de Tim se basa en los big % gainers haciendo foco en las penny stocks. Creo que E*TRADE e Interactive broker si dejan hacer short sales con menos capital. Yo por ahora solo me enfoco en ir Long. Short es un poco dificil para pequenas cuentas.
253 2018-09-06 21:55:22 Arrêtez avec ces ruptures d’échelles ! On croient que les stocks, relativement à la production, sont identiques.... Les stocks sur la production a augmenté de 50% en 10 ans !
254 2018-09-06 21:54:23 I am in a bad mood tonight, so FO. I don’t like dealing with MAGATs most of the time, as they are venal and stupid and selfish. If you don’t like “tax subsidies,” don’t drive on public roads, go to public schools, depend on public defense, depend on fire and rescue. Live off grid
255 2018-09-06 21:54:07 Canna stocks I'm watching for a breakout:

$MPX -  More sales than $TLRY or $CRON with a FRACTION of the market cap.

$CVSI - Boasting a far superior gross profit margin to many of the top contenders.  Also good sales.
256 2018-09-06 21:54:04 The Securities and Exchange Commission said Thursday that marijuana stocks were a hotbed of potential stock manipulation. 
The agency says to watch out for guaranteed returns, unregistered sellers, or unsolicited offers.
257 2018-09-06 21:53:15 @RobinhoodApp why don't you allow chatrooms for all stocks? It makes it fun to participate in trading.
258 2018-09-06 21:53:15 CNBC and their on-air stock pickers are still trying to convince more suckers to put their money in cryptocurrencies. Blockchain technology is not the same as cryptocurrencies. The guy that equated cannabis stocks to cryptocurrencies must be high.
259 2018-09-06 21:52:42 When you sell insider tradeing stocks, to which masonic jews does it go to, & how many are silenced & have accidents to suicides so far as workers or people that the FBI always knows about, & the federal system of courts?, and who gets paid for immunity to prosecution?.

262 2018-09-06 21:50:52 But on a plus side stocks and shares in gun and weapons companies will go up....
263 2018-09-06 21:50:04 I don't like corp subsidies. I don't like any subsidy whatsoever....A company, like a person, needs to stand on their own two feet.
264 2018-09-06 21:49:29 Oui les stocks sont longs à faire    mais 20 mL+ 20 mL +...... ça fait un repas ! ^^
265 2018-09-06 21:49:25 ...But I’m sure that like all the Other hypocrites, you’ll buy their stocks, Before they rebound!
Kaepernick was making a point about the Plight if the AA men/boys in America...maybe he should have only been concerned with White-collar crimes like money laundering & COLLUSION!
266 2018-09-06 21:48:38 ....or, golf trips disguised as “business expenses,” or their yachts, licensed under different countries’ flags, so leaches like Devos can escape taxes. So, again, shove it with your “tax subsidies,” as the corporations and wealthy are the biggest availers of “tax subsidies.”

270 2018-09-06 21:47:23 First, initial price target $19.20, but I think a larger move is coming $22-$25. CRUSHED EARNINGS AND RAISED FULL YEAR GUIDANCE!!!
271 2018-09-06 21:47:22 Trading stocks, coins, tokens, cards - it’s always easier when you don’t actually care about what you’re trading. Stop marrying your bags and you’ll be better off

273 2018-09-06 21:46:29 You didn’t pay anything, I paid for my own insurance, a very expensive policy. So, you can shove your “tax subsidies.” But, if I have to pay for tax subsidies, I would rather it goes to health care and education than tax write-offs to corporations and wealthy for their jet fuel..
274 2018-09-06 21:46:10 Negative outlooks on memory chips from Morgan Stanley and from KLA-Tencor sent chip stocks down today. Oregon-based laser tool manufacturer ESI fell 9%.
275 2018-09-06 21:46:05 This summer, various random friends have been expressing strong interest in stocks, particularly biotechs, $QQQ, and life insurance products. I noticed the same thing with real estate (Aug 2006), gold (Dec 2007 and Aug 2011), and cryptos (Dec 2017). Not a top, but a warning?
276 2018-09-06 21:45:46 If I was him I’d be spending less time on Twitter, more time getting rid of those Snapchat stocks he has asap
277 2018-09-06 21:45:44 Don’t matter to Bloke whether he trades donkey or stocks.
Bloke don’t lick no arseholes just because some fella on twitter claims he is good at trading and requires everyone to agree with him and treat him better than anyone else cause he thinks he a celeb.
278 2018-09-06 21:45:07 I am old enough to remember when a certain somebody said at @GrantsPub conference that healthcare industry stocks would be mopped by increased regulation... Still waiting for that to play out.
279 2018-09-06 21:44:49 You know you've made it as an "influencer" when a dude think your tweets might affect his stocks' value.
280 2018-09-06 21:44:36 Don’t u have stocks to watch ??
281 2018-09-06 21:44:30 Very true, 401k withdrawals are taxable. Also true, I could put more of my retirement savings in stocks, but then I would lose it when the big recession comes. Trump said last week the stock market is going to crash when he leaves office.
282 2018-09-06 21:43:53 SHOGUN GROUP stocks climb despite troubling geopolitical headlines
283 2018-09-06 21:41:58 What about people with 200+ shows that bring 100s to every show?  Those people just want to have fun. Is it their fault the store stocks them For purchase?  At that point, it’s just garbage on the shelf. Might as well have fun with it before it hits the landfill? Right?
284 2018-09-06 21:41:48 Moving proceeds from Ebook sales over to brokerage account to purchase dividend stocks to fund my "Real Wealth" Portfolio.

285 2018-09-06 21:41:40 I noticed that.  Fuel Product builds when the economy is supposed to be doing so great...smells kinda funny.  Glad to see etoh stocks draw.  NOV Rbob/Eth spread ripper.  Shoulda bought it at 0.75
286 2018-09-06 21:41:01 Yeh cool...
Old mate has some followers who trade stocks....
I have some followers that are school teachers. Must make me a school teacher...
Whole point is, just cause someone says they are something or good at it on twitter, doesn’t mean it’s true love...

288 2018-09-06 21:39:38 The Centers for Disease Control “have stocks in vaccines”....  Please show supporting evidence.
289 2018-09-06 21:39:32 Great news..  unfortunately did nothing for the stock...
290 2018-09-06 21:39:04 There are great shorts out there. $TUR , $SNAP, $GOGO and from before  $APRN, $LFIN, $GBT- it’s just that the noisiest stocks don’t trade on business results and are bad shorts in that regard.
291 2018-09-06 21:37:50 CNBC story this afternoon says it’s a parachute of mostly stocks and the board wants a clause so they can claw all of it back if the allegations are “proven” (reporters words).
292 2018-09-06 21:37:43 when stocks like $TLRY or $CRON go crazy like this. their Implied Vol gets absolutely insane..   i dont find buying puts a smart strategy unless its on a friday for a big directional play..   Shorting calls is best route for me..  thats how i went about the trades this week
293 2018-09-06 21:37:21 Yes, and I was responding to a person who was showing a annual stock rise chart nullifying the subject, that Nike has lost stocks since the Kaepernick deal, which is true. To which today Nike has dropped 34% popularity.
294 2018-09-06 21:37:16 So, how are your energy stocks doing?
295 2018-09-06 21:37:06 I'll take a look but he's already lost me with that breathtakingly fast switch from Medicare for All to the old Corporate Dem song "affordable health care". To me that simply means he or his friends own stocks (probably gifted) in insurance companies. He's toast in my book.
296 2018-09-06 21:36:51 He made 1.2 million off trading stocks with classified information.. game check don’t got enough 0’s on it????
297 2018-09-06 21:35:04 @CNBCFastMoney @GuyAdami @MelissaLeeCNBC @timseymour @stevegrasso We want to hear your opinion about stocks,  not music, not your personal life.  That is all such a waste of time.  Please restrain yourselves
298 2018-09-06 21:33:42 #antivaxxers point to the "whistleblower" Thompson and claim "scandal" but ignore facts that there siimply aren't any.  Citation needed for this "have stocks in #vaccines" claim.  You claim "compromised" because you can't argue the science on its merits.

321 2018-09-06 21:25:49 V true. Gotta look at which stocks are actually moving.
322 2018-09-06 21:25:33 Recall the stock market crash of 2008, when your leader at the time arrogantly proclaimed stocks were "now on sale."  There were no crocodile tears from @CPC_HQ  over the massacre of RRSP values and subsequent retirement incomes.
323 2018-09-06 21:25:27 They didn't plan on covering AR-15s and bump stocks, either.

328 2018-09-06 21:23:21 I took the typewriter, I used through university, to school as a historical artefact display item. The students loved it.  Mind you there was also a set of stocks in the room, they had great fun with those too

335 2018-09-06 21:21:48 Basically it means he was given information on what stocks to buy into or what stock to sell before it became public and everyone can buy or sell it. Illegal to have knowledge before hand
336 2018-09-06 21:21:10 1. Everyone can start at any level. Highlight the words you don’t understand and look it up in the dictionary. 2. Yes. Look at how google, Apple, eBay, amazon started. They were once penny stocks. Not only is it stocks but it’s also with crypto.
337 2018-09-06 21:20:25 News Flash... Nike stocks went up today, there is not near enough America supporters to even put a dent in a company as big and powerful as Nike.
338 2018-09-06 21:20:14 good for me cos stocks will be cheap.

381 2018-09-06 21:00:58 Good. VERY good.  It is TIME to hold these companies accountable.  Now, remember the strategy.  As their stocks take a dive, buy the stocks at the cheap and become the controlling interest and take over to change these companies from blue to red conservative.  Ruthless is needed.

I mentor, study stocks (which economics doesn’t seem to be taught in schools-it’s all about social justice ,sex and apologizing for USA/being white) and enjoying the blessings of USA

394 2018-09-06 20:56:48 He didn’t cost people their retirement funds or tank stocks. Insider trading is bad but on the scale that he did it there’s no way it’s deserving of 25 years in prison.

401 2018-09-06 20:52:42 Trick in cannabis space is to find the stocks with good fundamentals that. haven’t gone crazy yet . $crbp only $300mm mkt cap and cannabinoid drug in final pivotal trials in autoimmune diseases $ 5 bn peak revenue potential
402 2018-09-06 20:52:20 Tech selloff today was led by chip-related stocks (incl equipment makers) on fears demand may wane. Chip shares = notorious volatility. Thurs losers:

403 2018-09-06 20:51:50 Stocks may not be hurt for now, but the people are certainly becoming even more polarized.  You don't think it could be part of a bigger plan do You? Any media is good media...
404 2018-09-06 20:51:45 Sad.  Guess more stocks of Twitter will plummet.
405 2018-09-06 20:51:29 Actually Nike stocks were up you Moron.
406 2018-09-06 20:51:17 Most interesting but I think NIKE is looking for a way to downsize....they do employ if not mistaken around 73 thousand ppl world wide . Stocks low equals less payout package. And if need be now collateral damage for any US plants can relocate overseas. Humm  just thinking
407 2018-09-06 20:51:09 Get the Robinhood app get some stocks, cop some real estate, get a female put her hip, marry her and live rich together
408 2018-09-06 20:49:30 True, but the vast majority of the major pharmaceutical ones, which is where this started, are multi mational public corporations. The build up of stocks, I hate to break it too you, needs to be dome before #Brexit or else it won’t work.

410 2018-09-06 20:48:01 So Twitter’s stocks is down about 35% compared to 52 week high in June.
411 2018-09-06 20:47:22 Is he in a set of stocks and the audience queue up to pelt him with raw gammon or just kick him up the arse? I’d pay to watch that
412 2018-09-06 20:47:05 I don’t look at many stocks but I find it amazing how easy some stock charts look to trade. Even Amazon has fairly large gaps. Other stocks, like this, have gaps 10 feet high.
413 2018-09-06 20:46:48 #boycottnike I own tons of @Nike gear and I have no plans to burn any of it. Won’t buy anymore that’s for sure. I’m waiting for when they start burning the shoes inside Niketown. Looks like they’ve already started burning Nike stocks tho. 
414 2018-09-06 20:46:38 Did you notice adidas too at the bottom of your stocks post? Stocks have nothing to do with being on the right side of history 
415 2018-09-06 20:45:54 You have to be an idiot to bring up Nike stocks in an argument against their recent decisions
416 2018-09-06 20:45:49 That is very true

419 2018-09-06 20:44:44 Yes, Social Security is taxable income. My taxes may have decreased by a few dollars, but inflation is rising so much, it has been a net loss for me. My 401k has been pretty flat in 2018. Maybe people with more stocks are doing better.
420 2018-09-06 20:43:54 Stocks close slightly higher, trimming earlier gains
421 2018-09-06 20:42:39 Stocks that moved substantially or traded heavily on Thursday:
422 2018-09-06 20:42:23 Agree, Sept. insurance will bring another round of acre losses in WTX that will show up in later reports. World stocks remain the most compelling story going forward.

430 2018-09-06 20:36:11 The Dow Jones has risen 64,900% percent since the early 1930s. I think we'll be able to survive a 20% pullback. #stocks #dowjones
431 2018-09-06 20:35:50 Hey dude. Not everyone has a 401K and has nothing in the stock market. People are scared that he will take away social security and medicare. You know that most Americans don't invest in stocks cause they can't

443 2018-09-06 20:30:11 There are apparently a lot of people who really want to day-trade stocks or currencies or cryptocurrencies with enormous leverage, and a lot of unscrupulous (legal, semi-legal or illegal) online brokerages that will let them do it to their heart’s content. They will mostly lose
444 2018-09-06 20:30:08 He does nothing but cause problems for wild stocks. He is not a minister interested in doing anything for the good of wild salmon. His record proves his incompetence in that position. Constituents will remember you.

447 2018-09-06 20:29:43 ** Trading Rules for September 2018 **

Stating these publicly will hopefully help me stay accountable:

- No more trading big cap stocks (above $12-15 or "no clear edge to trade")

- No more then $8,000 loss per day (I find myself changing it often lately with the broker)

449 2018-09-06 20:28:17 A client recently asked for an update on our gold-oil-S&P 500 valuation analysis. The bottom line: by this math US #stocks are still reasonably priced & certainly nowhere near prior bubble peaks. #Oil is modestly cheaper than #gold. We gave the full details to our subscribers.
450 2018-09-06 20:28:04 The Perth mint has run out of silver coins....Funny that I purchase last week and stocks are plentiful according to the employee
451 2018-09-06 20:27:56 Tell the people the companies buying back their own stack can only last so long. They will run up the stocks until they are worth more than the companies and then down we go. 2008 all over again. This time it will be bad. Sorry

453 2018-09-06 20:27:16 So the recent Republican “tax cuts” added $1.5T to the American deficit and there has been over $1T in corporate stock buybacks to force stocks higher. 

Do any working Republicans see it as the scam it was/is yet?

Another round of corporate tax cuts coming soon...

459 2018-09-06 20:25:28 The name of the game in these current market conditions is to STAY SAFE.  I've never seen a market with so many "deceptive" plays as in stocks that seemingly look good on paper (range+liquidity) but so tricky to trade like the weed stocks right now.  $TLRY $CGC $CRON
460 2018-09-06 20:25:00 You can short stocks of any price.  A lot of people in the OTC use shorts as an excuse for bad price action though. "Oh these shorts are fucked once this runs" "Shorts taking this down" more like I am selling into my followers or the company is unloading shares and I bought high.
461 2018-09-06 20:24:57 Sorry, but this is fake news. ALL sneaker companies saw their stocks tumble on Tuesday which has more to do with uncertainty over trade with China due to Trump tariffs than with Kap. Nike stock has since rebounded. #wishfulthinking

470 2018-09-06 20:21:35 Another down day for the #NASDAQ, as #tech stocks take hits today.
Could be that the #StockMarket is poised for another pullback.

Wary #investors of political circumstances + weak hands + flat bond yield curve could mean that we're facing a pull-back in the markets.
471 2018-09-06 20:21:26 I didn't buy up flasks/pots because I felt my server wouldn't have a huge spike in price.  

So far flasks, pots, feast prices haven't moved. Herbs have dropped up to 30%. Only a few days in; perhaps it's just that people have flooded the AH with their stocks. Hoping for rebound.
472 2018-09-06 20:21:03 Lmao! NKE back up to 80.40 a share... it will make up its losses by next week as people are buying more stocks.
473 2018-09-06 20:20:46 $Study - action plan,  wait for volatility to narrow - target slingshot entires on pull back -- many stocks need to fall into a base for a couple
474 2018-09-06 20:20:29 So which is it? “Nike stock fell due to the CK campaign” - “Nike stock pulled all the stocks in their sector down” (lunacy) - or “the stock market goes up and down”? You just argued against your first opinion that a stock dip was because of the CK campaign! Stocks go up and down!
475 2018-09-06 20:20:09 yea i know figured itll drop at MOST 26.$ for a bounce . im probably going long term trade for a while ... smh . i had this thing AT 9$ earlier this year and sold at 10 bro SMFH still kicking myself . $RNVA and $AMD are the two stocks ive learned so much from since trading smh
476 2018-09-06 20:20:07 Which translates to about 3% and it’s already back up about 1.4%. May have took an initial hit but it’s not going anywhere/dropping any lower. Same thing happened to Dicks and now stocks are higher than they were before the new rule was even announced.
477 2018-09-06 20:19:38 They just lost 4 billion (in a day). Stocks dropped and now, Nick Saban is rumored to yank their Nike contract for Alabama football. Kaep wouldn’t have the balls to lace up the boots and do what real hero’s do.
478 2018-09-06 20:19:02 So tomorrow we ditch pot stocks and trade software?
479 2018-09-06 20:18:39 Shares of Suncor were up the day of the announcement. Then down with oil prices (-5%) in next 5 days. Yes, sentiment plays a part, but oil stocks trade mainly on oil price. That said, I'm sure CN stock was up same day. And CPP + BCIMC got good value for their KM Cda shares.

485 2018-09-06 20:14:45 Another down day overall for stocks, led by techs, but cash continued to flow into "defensive" sectors. Classic mkt  "rotation" when bulls are scared.

Nasdaq -0.9% (vs -1.2% Wed), S&P -0.4%, Russell 2000 -0.7%, but Dow +0.08% to 25,995.

494 2018-09-06 20:13:11 They also have a primary responsibility, as @Conservatives are keen to point out, to maximise shareholder value. Holding massive stocks lowers a number of key metrics such as NWC. Not great for shareholders, and neither is more cost on admin at borders.

509 2018-09-06 20:05:22 They were on a steady rise, a stable stock. The only reason it doesn't continue to drop is in-trading and collusion. Political decisions like this tend to ruin companies if not for corruption in stocks.

524 2018-09-06 20:01:50 .@UrbanOutfitters' stock is dropping.
Know why you don't care?
1) You don't have stock in UO.
2) Stocks rise/drop all the time.
3) There is zero correlation between how a stock is doing and societal outrage/support from those who don't own stock.

533 2018-09-06 19:58:39 The news can't be that bullish, judging by the lackluster performance of uranium stocks. I think they are still working off the recent surge.

Index investors claim to know nothing about picking stocks to outperform the market.

Index investors are comfortable being price takers of the market, because they believe active stock pickers have done a good enough

549 2018-09-06 19:49:48 I’m not saying Nike won’t go up. Won’t “skyrocket” like folks think but it’ll go up. I’m only saying the average Joe tweetin bout Nike stocks ain’t even gon invest $500. Let alone let it sit n go up n down. You need some racks to make something happen. Period bro. Point blank.

560 2018-09-06 19:44:44 Just to share the , when $HEXO.CA didn't come in w the rest of the #cannabis stocks this morning, that was our tell to step up our buys.  Real cheap vs. peers + breakout on chart + "chatter" via shareholder letter = worthy use of capital.

568 2018-09-06 19:41:22 Of course it’s going to rise, that’s what the stock market and stocks do, them plummet, then slowly come back up. Doesn’t make up for the billions lost. But hey you know more
569 2018-09-06 19:40:29 Sense of foreboding, many stocks are on a downward spiral but that makes it a good time to buy.

583 2018-09-06 19:33:07 You’re going to rule at this esp. since you also have the front-end knowledge that others in your position may not. Multi-talented is multi-good!

585 2018-09-06 19:32:04 @AOTtrades @Andrew4562 what is the best strategy for trading options w a AOT alert? I have a smaller account so normally cannot trade such big stocks. Is it best to have an option with expiration date 2 or 3 weeks out? Should strike price be closer to current stock price??
586 2018-09-06 19:31:59 Unfortunately the economy has not allowed we, individual tax payers to have our expenses stay low. The tax breaks to businesses have allowed businesses to buy back their stocks, which is the reason for inflated stock prices.

591 2018-09-06 19:26:41 I don't think it's Pence, as I've watched plenty of his speeches across the country regarding jobs, economy, stocks, social issues, etc. & 100% of the time he always gives praise/thanks to POTUS 4 the awesome job he's doing. Never once did he ever say negative words about Trump!
592 2018-09-06 19:26:39 Slightly risk averse mood in equity & bond markets. S&P500 down 0.4%, tech stocks again the worst. Disappointing US private payrolls data weighed on bond yields. G10 currencies fairly stable; in emerging markets the Russian ruble took the baton in sinking to a multi-year low.

604 2018-09-06 19:22:20 how is purchasing stocks legal?
605 2018-09-06 19:21:54 Yes. So around 300-400k vials per month. Plus breakages/loss/ bad batch etc so pad that. If insulin pumps break you change regime and add in a second completely different type of insulin which you need stocks of. So pad that. How many months of no deal? @J_amesp

609 2018-09-06 19:19:25 Economy continues strong but U.S. and International stocks struggling in September, with global concerns increasing about trade and emerging markets. September typically a challenging month for the markets. Likely to be flat to downward bias in the next 30 days.

619 2018-09-06 19:13:58 Portfolio management is a skill that requires a lot more thinking than just picking a bunch of stocks you like.  Each stock and it's respective size, liquidity, correlations etc must be considered in the context of the whole portfolio.

776 2018-09-06 18:15:30 Based on some of these dividend paying Chinese stocks - is it fair to state that currently China's government is more or less allowing capital to flow out of its domestic businesses to foreigners via dividends?  (even Cayman domiciled ones getting divs from China subs)
777 2018-09-06 18:15:06 For those that trendfollow/swing stocks w/Tradenet, I suggest utilizing the TEFS website. It's great for filtering noise as you get the news, fundamentals, ownership %, ratings, estimates, sector rankings, and more all in one spot. I use to view 3-5 websites for this info.

789 2018-09-06 18:10:55 Agree with Duane. The stocks will be fine. And he’ll raising is one thing. He’ll raising because someone peacefully protests but much less outrage (collectively) when children are sexually abused? Seems to be an imbalance there, IMHO

793 2018-09-06 18:08:12 Of course it’s not. Did anyone pay attention to the @NFL ratings after all this started happening? Plus, he’s not s good QB. Looking forward to looking at @Nike stocks and profits plummet much like Colin’s career as a QB.

802 2018-09-06 18:05:53 Honestly it would be a smallcap fund. See the stocks Dsp and SBI small cap funds are invested into. 

But LS you are a smart guy, wait for a good correction in the major index until then I would be in a 100% debt Coz drawdowns can be brutal in a smallcap fund.
803 2018-09-06 18:05:07 them and then let them sit. They are only obligated to keep up with demand. There have been better returns available than silver, like stocks and cryptos, thus lack of demand for silver Eagles. When silver dropped down to $14, a wave of buying cleaned them out. So,

814 2018-09-06 18:03:19 I see ppl burning Nike, so who offering up the 1st pair of Jordan’s? If you going to boycott might as well do it big 

And I don’t see nobody selling their Nike stocks , just making it look good for the camera.

817 2018-09-06 18:02:09 2. Companies should not be allowed to buy back their own stocks.  It is better for companies to increase dividends, wages, employment, research and development, buy more plant and equipment.

Last I checked they are....consumer stocks.  
Don't be surprised if these correct. 
  Market is sending lots of warning signs here.  
$CLX uber defensive near ATH's!
820 2018-09-06 18:01:16 Yeah, but the worth of the stocks go by product sales. Buying failing stocks won't help Nike at all in the long run.
821 2018-09-06 18:00:52 $TWTR $SQ
I banked more than 100% on these 2 stocks this year from buying late last year.

Instead of keeping some of each, I kept $TWTR and zero $SQ before last ER. Bad choice. Still love them both for awesome profits. Will just hold $TWTR until $100. LoL
822 2018-09-06 18:00:46 Unfortunately it's all scaremongering until it actually happens and then it's too late. Of course the rich buying up stocks will be fine. And the ignorant - for maybe a day.

827 2018-09-06 17:59:42 I loved that car.
828 2018-09-06 17:58:49 Buy Nike stocks, soon to go back up
829 2018-09-06 17:57:58 And then lose all of his stocks to the steel toe spike
830 2018-09-06 17:57:23 Diversified stocks.
831 2018-09-06 17:56:47 The central banks committed the cardinal sin of central banking and got nothing but long euphoric rallies in stocks bonds and USD. And dead gold.
832 2018-09-06 17:56:30 I dunno, I have seen stocks worth over $6,000. $80 is awfully cheap for a major corporation like that.
833 2018-09-06 17:55:40 Stocks is where all the money is.
834 2018-09-06 17:55:35 Based on previous tariff on steel, there’ll be selloff on E-commerce and Chinese stocks. Short these stocks $AMZN $JD $BABA $BZUN
835 2018-09-06 17:55:20 It’s more similar to stocks than website domains purely because of the financial nature of cryptocurrency. Unchecked speculation will inevitably lead to crashes (see the history of the US stock market for example).
836 2018-09-06 17:55:18 Ahh lol the one on vicarage lane opens 1-2 every Friday to sell their over stocks it’s dirt cheap
837 2018-09-06 17:55:13 Okay , yes it all depends on which filament to use. Wax filament is not widely available but MatterHackers stocks MOLDLAY which has wax like properties. Wax filament is something new at the moment so it might have wide range of disadvantages for the properties so it’s generally
838 2018-09-06 17:54:14 Wonderful. Did you see the bounce back on Nike stocks!
839 2018-09-06 17:54:07 How do I buy stocks
840 2018-09-06 17:53:43 Very brief chats! But yes fun. Of all the coaches, Amber Stocks was the most generous w/ her time. She talked draft strategy w/ my brother (@thatsnotafoul) for the longest time at the B1G tourney. Upset Sky fired her after just 2 seasons; didn’t give her a fair shot to succeed.
841 2018-09-06 17:53:33 Wait a minute..... so you’re saying stocks fluctuate day by day? I’m not buying it Ryen.
842 2018-09-06 17:52:55 $OKTA So will this fall 8% or 12% post earnings? Either / or, decline to May levels is in order right after. #stocks
843 2018-09-06 17:52:55 Buy $fb now at this almost 1-year low or not, what do you think?  #trading #stocks #facebook
844 2018-09-06 17:52:41 If y’all think a Nike AD will influence it’s stock or other similar stocks of its kind..... you got a lot to learn when it comes to the market lol
845 2018-09-06 17:52:36 That is true, remember that there was a VERY lopsided vote in Congress on the question, so we all knew they were going to do something.  That said, it should have limited the widening to stocks already trading 5 cents or greater on average, & only done groups 1 & 2...
846 2018-09-06 17:52:25 If you have a feeling I don’t like you, don’t ask me for advice on Stocks. 
I'll recommend you a 3X Leveraged ETF and watch your money go bye bye.

848 2018-09-06 17:52:11 Do you have any idea what will happen to tech stocks after the tariff implemented?
849 2018-09-06 17:51:23 No precedent for the CEO of a public company tweeting out a fake take-private offer during market hours. Even the C teams at heavily shorted fraud stocks are usually smart enough not to score own goals like that.
850 2018-09-06 17:50:43 He was a good player. Certainly better than half of the guys quarterbacking.  And as for the cost of the campaign it’s just started so there’s not a way to quantify it. All shoe company stocks were down on Monday only Nike has rebounded
851 2018-09-06 17:50:00 Low key want Nike stocks to go down just so I can hit the sales
852 2018-09-06 17:49:59 Agree on child orders but my takeaway is it appears that firms continued using the same algos and methods for TSP stocks when perhaps they should have sought different methods.  A good example on why we need #CAT and better #bestexecution
853 2018-09-06 17:49:33 These weed stocks are gonna make me name my son "canopy growth" factual
854 2018-09-06 17:48:30 Sports wear is seasonal, it's co-incided with the end of summer, their stocks are already back up, using Kaepernick was a smart move for sales.
855 2018-09-06 17:48:29 Go promote some penny stocks

857 2018-09-06 17:48:09 So long as they pay out when asked, does it matter if they actually bought and sold the underlying stocks?
858 2018-09-06 17:47:44 Economists’ thinking on the margin: Sanders’ BEZOS Act incentivizes companies to hire fewer people who receive gov benefits. 

On the margin, true. But what about levels? Who stocks the warehouses if Amazon doesn’t make these hires? 

There’s more to this story than the margin.
859 2018-09-06 17:46:42 But he is a Forrester Stephanie is his mother biological you can’t get more family than that.

860 2018-09-06 17:46:40 @StocksNCrypto thanks for the follow, Stocks-n-Crypto & have a great Thursday!
861 2018-09-06 17:46:34 Are executed* at NAV. 

That cost is what it will cost them to go out and pay the spread to buy the underlying stocks, and other things.
862 2018-09-06 17:46:32 The ACA was a gift to the insurance companies. Their stocks jumped after the passage and since then. The centrist Dems let us all down with That bill. We deserve better. #M4A
863 2018-09-06 17:46:06 Yes. We agree that mutual funds transactions are better at NAV. But the MF manager still pay the spreads on the underlying securities when they purchase the stocks. 

ETFs have a spread because the APs have to bake into the cost of selling you the shares.
864 2018-09-06 17:45:57 was thinking the same...  I was getting nervous when my portfolio kept hitting ATH's day after day..  forced me to start selling..  Today, Im buying and selling puts in stocks I would like to buy even cheaper
865 2018-09-06 17:45:17 @garyvee In your opinion, what are the best ways to earn passive income? I am currently investing in stocks, putting money away in 401k... but I feel there are so many other opportunities. Btw, I'm 23 years old. #thoughts #StriveForGreatness
866 2018-09-06 17:45:14 I can tell you with 99.9% accuracy whenever the stock I am watching is going to run. It is when my kiddos absolutely need me NOW and I have to leave my computer. @VinnyEmini has robotic assisted trading. I have tantrum assisted trading. #daytrading #stocks #futures #momlife
867 2018-09-06 17:44:38 They represent the amount of stocks you take
868 2018-09-06 17:44:29 Guys; targets are for the shooting range or a place to pick up a cheap pair of sneakers. Not for stocks. I don't have targets so please stop asking me! Thanks!
869 2018-09-06 17:44:09 I follow stocks & major investment moves. I'm not seeing it. I'm seeing manipulation of tarriffs giving China and Russia the upperhand on America. I'm seeing America being sold out. The OGE said the people have authority to regulate the President's ethics. Both sides are covered.
870 2018-09-06 17:43:55 Invested in some Nike stocks now it's taking off  look at God lol
871 2018-09-06 17:43:51 It’s really a win win, they look like the good guys & regain the market share they lost to adidas & rebook/champion this past year. Their stocks gona go right back up after qrtr’s sales reports drop
872 2018-09-06 17:42:53 Boycott Nike’s products and sell your Nike stocks.  Pass the word
873 2018-09-06 17:42:34 They can stop or slow it only when institutional and big businesses will come in.Then we would see some balance and manipulators will lose power. Anything else, it’s only manipulation, exactly as in penny stocks.
874 2018-09-06 17:42:23 Twitter leads social-media stocks downward a day after Capitol Hill testimony
875 2018-09-06 17:42:19 Put targets on police backs? No. Deplete the military? Questionable. We spent more on defense than the next 10 countries combined. Did Trump increase military spending in the interests of national security or because of his substantial investment in defense stocks?
876 2018-09-06 17:42:18 However, a lot of tokens do share many similarities (and differences) with stocks. I'd say that a lot of them are not reaching their full potential because they are engineered to intentionally avoid being deemed securities by regulators (adding friction/reducing features).

878 2018-09-06 17:41:21 At midday, #Mortgage Bonds modestly higher. #Stocks lower as the tech sector weighs on Stocks. 10-yr yield 2.87%. #investments
879 2018-09-06 17:40:08 I have said over and over again and continue to say that $SQ and $AVAV are amazing stocks to hold going forward. The next one that I recently added is $CNTTF. One of the few pot stocks that is profitable. Could be an excellent buyout candidate also.
880 2018-09-06 17:39:24 Do you invest? What do you invest in? #investments #crypto #stocks
881 2018-09-06 17:38:41 IMO, the only tokens that are new/better stocks are tokens that are clearly aiming to be security tokens. Other token issuers are usually very clear in stating that their tokens are NOT securities and convey no ownership or rights to the organization/profits.
882 2018-09-06 17:38:37 BTW I am most certainly claiming that one. #PRM management teams should focus on buying rocks not stocks #RocksNotStocks .  Penny royalty charge.  Moving on to watching GDX struggle to add a nickel to its price chart.
883 2018-09-06 17:38:11 Bond buying wasn't too effective and now the PPT is probably buying stocks too
884 2018-09-06 17:37:51 Agreed... should fade now that conference is over and momentum traders move on to other stocks. People see the stock was at 50 and think it's cheap now... They are fucking morons of course, and fundamentals will take over eventually.
885 2018-09-06 17:37:28 Final point.  I kid about Mumbles a lot and still hold a grudge re LSG to TAHO deal.  He seems to be a hell of an asset on geology/rock biz and based on what I've seen / heard he is not a good stock trader (see LSG / TAHO (toilet) paper). I prefer he buy rocks than stocks.  End.
886 2018-09-06 17:37:26 Don't know if you are aware, but the President you are resisting is letting us all enjoy  lower taxes, record low unemployment, booming economy, soaring stocks, 400% growth in black businesses, fair trade deal with Mexico, more jobs, lowest unemployed blacks, latinos,and women.
887 2018-09-06 17:36:54 Stocks fall and bounce back up. Tomorrow it will go back down a few #s. Quote me on that.
888 2018-09-06 17:36:38 The people that are guests that have the stocks but the consumers in the people that believe the message Nike is pushing will continue the buy their products and soon after greed will overcome your believe and you will buy the stocks again
889 2018-09-06 17:36:24 The EU does day to day damage to our fishing industry & stocks. It is a  cartel. If we remain and compulsorily adopt the  London will be seriously damaged.

892 2018-09-06 17:35:16 Absolutely! I’m a customer for the education, rather than the stock picks. However the winning stocks help! Haha. Although I do have a curiosity...what’s to say that you didn’t buy MSFT for yourself after recommending selling it?
893 2018-09-06 17:35:11 Plot twist:
48% lied in the survey after buying put option warrants on facebook stocks 
894 2018-09-06 17:34:34 I swear. It’s crazy little do people know stocks isn’t the best way to gain money. It’s very hard to catch an upcoming stock to make a lot of money on. There’s plenty of things to invest in other than stocks.
895 2018-09-06 17:34:33 Yeah, stocks aren't dropping because of a lack of car sales.
896 2018-09-06 17:34:29 Stocks will continue to fall. Many others sell great shoes and clothing. We don't need to buy Nike
897 2018-09-06 17:34:27 Crypto's are TOAST....Buy Cannabis stocks....the next BIG THING!

901 2018-09-06 17:32:13 He's trading fast moving stocks so the prices can move very quickly. If the price is no longer comfortable for you to get in then don't. There's always another opportunity. Good luck!
902 2018-09-06 17:32:06 One joined the Fleadh celebrations swimming around Drogheda recently. Never seen one near that area of the Boyne before. Perhaps it's indicative of a loss of fish stocks in the areas around our coast?

910 2018-09-06 17:29:05 European Stocks Are At A Critical Technical Support Level
 
Several key equity trendline tests are underway across the European region...
911 2018-09-06 17:28:15 For the past 5 years I've been saying that one should have to pass a state test to be able to trade stocks/crypto cause lots of u don't really know how 2 properly trade stock will be thin as a piece of paper and u still wanna bid sit. So sticks can move up fast if u tap the ask
912 2018-09-06 17:27:46 You are probably correct. Even taking that into consideration, the stocks have been trending up over the past year.
913 2018-09-06 17:27:43 If It wasn’t for Crypto I would have never been interested in trading stocks,So for what ever I have lost  it’s just the price I had to pay to learn something new I have ZERO REGRETS :)

938 2018-09-06 17:21:56 I look for clear reversal signs with Price-Action and eSIX (Green) from the AB=CD pattern completion zone. Until then I have no position. Also, supported by some sort of recovery in China stocks

959 2018-09-06 17:14:51 Yeah, my intellect tells me that stocks/equities go down and comomodities/Bitcoin go up , but my instinct of the people tells me we are set for some DOOM, and that I should probably put some shorts on.
960 2018-09-06 17:12:41 This is EXACTLY the discussion I had with my Republican cousin. He was expounding scripture about life. I asked about bump stocks. What are they used for? Killing. Killing what?  Life!  Exactly hypocrite! How about castrating men 4 rape? Let government begin to rule men’s bodies!

1008 2018-09-06 16:55:57 This isn't a crypto thing but it still is sad to hear. People make irresponsible decisions when it comes to other markets, stocks, etc. Even starting companies has a 10% success rate. Investing is always a risk. And people will always be greedy and irresponsible.

1012 2018-09-06 16:54:52 Oh good Richard.
So you're against manufacturing pink and blue guns that confused toddlers, and kill moms, dads and siblings and themselves.
And you're against bump stocks that get around fully auto rules and wounded 500 people in Las Vegas.
And green tipped cop killing bullets?
1013 2018-09-06 16:54:33 I hold. I only talk positively about stocks I hold because I believe in them. I can’t speak for others.
1014 2018-09-06 16:54:06 Indeed. Sometimes hard to respect stops as stocks can then bounce but it’s better than taking one in the shorts. Had same with $VRTX - now I’m glad I was stopped out last week, but at time I was not happy.
1015 2018-09-06 16:54:06 Teach them instead to open an investment accound and buy some stocks.  I opened an account for my son and he bought AMD stock below $2 and made more ten times his money in two years. It is now $28.
1016 2018-09-06 16:54:01 The Dow Jones .DJI fell 12.34 points to 25,952.48, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 4.8 points, to 2,896.72 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 18.29 points, or 0.23 percent, to 8,091.25.

1027 2018-09-06 16:52:19 I got bonds not stocks bitch thats how you save and when I cross the road I look both fuckin ways.

1029 2018-09-06 16:51:54 Damn kinda don't wanna go to our weekly cause I remember it's 3 stocks 
1030 2018-09-06 16:51:40 Bitcoin is Tanking But So are Stocks, Fiats & Indexes, It’s Just a Normal Cycle.
1031 2018-09-06 16:51:32 How cute. 
You think taxation is corruption, when it’s not. 

Illegally using taxpayer funds is. 

Using money you earn to buy stocks isn’t corrupt either. 

Do a little research.
1032 2018-09-06 16:51:05 When are the shareholders going to start class action lawsuit against Nike for their deliberate actions causing stocks to fall when they have fiduciary responsible to act in best interests of shareholders.
1033 2018-09-06 16:50:37 Non issue and you will die on this hill. I’m also a Walker supporter. Stick to issues at hand.
1034 2018-09-06 16:50:36 Many of those liquidating EM assets will be buying US stocks, not bonds. And US bond proxies. Perhaps the US-EM divergence will continue?

And the world is literally awash with USTs / high quality collateral. Puts pressure on yields and lowers bank balance sheet demand.
1035 2018-09-06 16:50:35 I did not # an OTC promoter.  I think it was a retweet that had a tag like that.  

If Super Stocks is behind a certain company like $MSPC, and there happens to incidentally be a promoter behind the same company.....that does not mean that Super Stocks is supporting the promoter.
1036 2018-09-06 16:50:32 I don't think stock buybacks cause a false value. Bubbles are caused by people overpaying for assets e.g. houses stocks etc. But a company repurchasing their own stock is healthy.

1044 2018-09-06 16:47:12 Well, u c what he done from last year's record to this year's record. He had to construct a team after selecting the number 1 draft pick with Aja Wilson. He wins 8 more games than last year. He basically got Amber Stocks fired. He has 1# pick n 2019. Yes, he will select Durr.
1045 2018-09-06 16:46:34 What are the best us gambling stocks? MGM? LVS?
1046 2018-09-06 16:46:13 I look at my stocks like I got a million dollars in the market. I got 100 dollars in this damn portfolio and I have mini heart attacks at 30 cent losses. 
1047 2018-09-06 16:45:44 $AMD Stocks that don’t follow trading conviction are being bought and sold by those that know nothing of the “rules”.  Therefore one should not expose themselves to unlimited downside risk esp when momentum is the other way.
1048 2018-09-06 16:45:33 I have much less confidence. Why? Cost of food/goods/services is creeping up & will jump more w/tariffs; cost of healthcare & drugs increasing due to destabilization of ACA & more inflation due to deficit. When stocks crash, another huge setback.

You have fed the greedy hounds
1049 2018-09-06 16:45:00 Interesting to see a lot of retail stocks making new 52-w highs this morning on a weak overall tape: $BOOT, $DG, $KSS, $KR, $JWN, $TGT. Retail ETF $XRT is pulling back on very low volume
1050 2018-09-06 16:44:58 Oh so there were nasty fans back then too. Mind you you didn't hear about them then without the invention of 'anti' social media
1051 2018-09-06 16:44:37 Still holding some $lvs Jan 70 calls. I added a little today. Doesn’t look good but I believe if USA & China strike a deal soon should turn around along with all Chinese stocks.
1052 2018-09-06 16:43:59 Didn't u see $AVGO Even I'm in for ER. It couldn't do any better. Dropping too fast. Maximum can add $10 only if ER winning. Noway can make money over here. Forget about to get back in Chinese stocks no trust it at all.
1053 2018-09-06 16:43:49 Stocks are not sales, hun.
1054 2018-09-06 16:43:41 staying away from shorting uptrending stock is really working for me so far. I just look for the low hanging fruit ie just shorting weak stocks = stock that are red on the day. My 2 cent
1055 2018-09-06 16:43:18 Buy stocks and benefit from the buy backs. No evidence that stock buy backs cause a bubble but they do strengthen a companies balance sheet.
1056 2018-09-06 16:43:11 Can you please stop fucking with my stocks and also just stop everything thanks @realDonaldTrump
1057 2018-09-06 16:43:05 Ikea ta gestion des stocks qui me fait courir depuis maintenant 6 semaines après un lit merci ta mère.

1059 2018-09-06 16:42:57 The stocks are booming, but not the US economy!
1060 2018-09-06 16:42:52 Yo fool so far this week I have lost 2 thousand dollars on my stocks total for the month 14000.00 don't think that's winning you lie about everything resign!

1062 2018-09-06 16:42:38 AU I believe, is the symbol for gold. "Or" was my correction for what spell--hell substituted for my intended "or". But yes, I have gold stocks as a hedge for the coming crisis when the GOP Deficit sh-t hits the economic fan! Soon, after Trump quits.
1063 2018-09-06 16:42:15 on days and weeks like these you say “I am extremely bullish and very strongly convicted that you buy dips because I think US Stocks go much higher from here and this presents a good opportunity, especially stock specific (like NVDA)...but all you guys are just a bunch of hedgers
1064 2018-09-06 16:42:09 When stocks are at an ATL like this, how do you determine downside target or support ($22)?
1065 2018-09-06 16:41:01 Investing in stocks
1066 2018-09-06 16:40:45 Love it x
1067 2018-09-06 16:40:40 Assume nothing.  If you are advocating people dollar-cost average into stocks, then I'm calling for you to show that you do it yourself.
1068 2018-09-06 16:39:52 kind of (no offense) pathetic to say “stocks are going much higher, but I have no idea when or what they do next” makes no sense JC
1069 2018-09-06 16:39:40 Suppliers do maintain stocks you imbecile. However the governments stupidity means greater stocks are needed. As a Pharma manufacturer why should we bear that cost? Just another #Brexit cost that wasn't put on the side of a bus.
1070 2018-09-06 16:38:39 And yet, stocks went back up and sales are up.
1071 2018-09-06 16:38:14 Finna buy a couple stocks from Nike 
1072 2018-09-06 16:38:12 That's a different argument, of course. The argument I refer to is "why do these sophisticated investors bother with 'alternatives' when they could have just owned stocks?"
1073 2018-09-06 16:37:52 All my stocks in the red today 
1074 2018-09-06 16:37:47 I feel like the same people who were really into crypto currency are the same people investing in weed stocks. But the weed stocks are still a better buy.
1075 2018-09-06 16:37:41 Charlie; you will understand this because you no doubt deal in contingency stocks; there is a turnover of the stock. It’s a nightmare to manage. Especially with time-sensitive stuff. Keep calling these tossers out!
1076 2018-09-06 16:37:20 Time to sell Danish stocks then??
1077 2018-09-06 16:37:12 $NFLX has a gap to fill at around 328.50ish.  It's that time of the rotation, stocks gapped up a few times and need to check back and re-fill before going higher
1078 2018-09-06 16:36:33 You’re trying to make it look like you care but you couldn’t even bring yourself to ban bump stocks
1079 2018-09-06 16:36:09 Stocks are trading in Negative territory with Tech Stocks continuing the plunge (possible correction ahead?).  MBS is up 16bps now and Yields are down to 2.87%.
1080 2018-09-06 16:35:38 What are some good apps to purchase those Amazon,apple & Nike stocks or is it better to deal with a broker/fiduciary.Also is there any good books  to educate yourself on the stock market and buying also.Trying to get my slice of the pie.

1104 2018-09-06 16:30:09 I really be on this Stash app wondering how I never really understood how stocks worked. It’s very simple. It’s like depositing your money into a bank but getting higher appreciation percentages. Obviously, you can lose money, but it seems the key is safe stocks + IPOs.

1175 2018-09-06 16:11:04 The shareholder is the unsung victim of the 21st century.

Coincidentally, the political trend in stocks thus far has been to encourage the working class to become as involved as possible in the stock market.

1248 2018-09-06 15:49:26 Plausible theory:
The seemingly ludicrous & suicidal business strategy by Nike, Levi’s, Starbucks, Dicks, etc could be explained by a backroom plan to short the stocks - a quick way to manipulate/tank the stock and raise BIG $ to fund Cabal needs. Precedent is classic Soros.

1281 2018-09-06 15:38:26 Your stocks grew because tax cuts during a growing economy (the toddlers version of good economics) benefited corporations instead of the people... and now the economy is overheating and interest rates will rise. I'm guessing you've never studied economics.

1297 2018-09-06 15:34:54 I agree! Do not be mad, you did the right thing! chasing is very risky strategy. There will be another one soon!
1298 2018-09-06 15:34:14 The market is down right now. The big tech companies are the stocks bring it down. These stocks have been bought up by Soros/NWO/Open Society. They control the market and the Federal Reserve. This will continue and get worse until Nov. 6.

1303 2018-09-06 15:32:07 @Nike Dumb ass! Who is getting fired over this? Stocks crash over some dumb ass decision to support a guy who calls police ‘pigs’ and disrespects the flag. Come on, what dumb ass would think that was a good business decision? Who’s covering my losses?
1304 2018-09-06 15:31:42 I am in neither. Chinese stocks will rally once trade is resolved. I know that doesn't help much right now.
1305 2018-09-06 15:31:10 Until we as minorities own majority share of whatever it is, we will not win. Nike stocks drop and lose due to market reaction. But minorities will continue purchasing and drive profits up “supporting” them. In the end they always win. It was a highly calculated publicity stunt.

1319 2018-09-06 15:27:04 Yes there's a political crisis now. But soon it could be economic with stocks and housing prices unreasonably up in the context of secular stagnation. It's obviously already an ecological crisis. And later an anthropological one of new posthuman inequalities from new tech.

1362 2018-09-06 15:13:58 Here's my thing: trying to draw conclusions about what a long-term investor *should* do based on the current market cycle (post-GFC) is nuts. OF COURSE institutional investors aren't beating passive stock indices. Stocks have crushed everything over that period.

1423 2018-09-06 15:02:51 I prefer to work for someone else because I like the stability of an established business that finds the customers for me, hires the accountants, handles the taxes, replaces the roof, cleans the toilets, purchases new equipment, negotiates office leases, stocks inventory, etc.
1424 2018-09-06 15:02:42 Has there been a report on recent sales? I know I bought something just to support Colin. Stocks down? Who trades?
1425 2018-09-06 15:02:42 Those investing in stocks may be doing well. The 80% of Americans who live paycheck to paycheck have seen the actual value of their earnings fall behind inflation rate. So most of us have lost money due to Trump’ economics.
1426 2018-09-06 15:02:29 #Ethanol stocks were down 0.4 to 22.7 mil barrels. Production was estimated at 1087 Mb/d up 17 from a week ago and vs 1060 a year ago

1430 2018-09-06 15:01:25 Secondary trend not going to become the primary? Doesnt that create a buying opp in the focus list stocks?
1431 2018-09-06 15:01:24 This statement is filled with half-truths and misleading...for example the business investment is corporations buying back stocks not paying good wages
1432 2018-09-06 15:01:06 Having to deal with the K-1s at tax time and the volatility of the stocks due to energy prices makes the sector nearly un-investable for many retail investors.  Better yield opportunities elsewhere.

1435 2018-09-06 15:00:41 as for greenfield, that is a term commonly used in construction, referring to projects built from scratch, without restrictions from prior work/infrastructure. 

So using it as a pun for cannabis stocks, is, I would argue, actually kinda clever.
1436 2018-09-06 15:00:31 Yeah they can always mess with stocks which are "hard to borrow", thus they trade with the most Pump before the drop.  $RIOT $LFIN $VERI etc.. were all similar to this at one time

1445 2018-09-06 14:57:18 @Nike Thank you so much for this ad!!  I haven't been wearing Nike as much in recent years but now it will be nothing else. I'm very proud of what you have done. Stocks may have went down at first but you will make a huge comeback. I'm sure of it!!  Very proud of your company!!
1446 2018-09-06 14:56:46 Any particular reason you are focusing on weed stocks lately? Just the hot sector aspect?
1447 2018-09-06 14:56:44 I despise days when stocks that have absolutely nothing to do with each other ( $AAPL and $AMZN) are down the EXACT same percentage because “the market is selling tech”. Give me a fucking break!
1448 2018-09-06 14:56:36 The agenda is to ride Obama’s coat tails.  When obama came in stocks were at 8000. When he left they were 19000. Unemployment was at 9.5% and when he left 4.6%. Trump is riding those improvements. You can hate obama for other reasons I suppose. He did a great job.

1450 2018-09-06 14:56:12 Our government needs to do something about neked shorting on stocks like yesterday they did on mnkd and gern...
1451 2018-09-06 14:55:53 Absolutely wrong.

#Bitcoin is the return of sound money, the asset that's been missing from the economy for a century.

To think of it in the same category as stocks is missing the point entirely.
1452 2018-09-06 14:55:40 To earn million$ in #crypto u should have balls & guts worth million$  there is nothing changed fundamentally in last 24 hours. It's just the usual game by institution, they did it with tech stocks now they doing with #bitcoin #cryptocurrency

1457 2018-09-06 14:54:38 My advice on these weed stocks is you really CANNOT give them the benefit of the doubt.  They always seem to go further than you think, BOTH ways.  Give it some slack and don't over commit too early $TLRY $CRON $CGC
1458 2018-09-06 14:54:18 I think the difference is that when the economy goes up and down (as compared to stocks) is that when it goes up and down that changes employment in areas like retail, construction, part time, and that affects regular people the most
1459 2018-09-06 14:54:09 PSU stocks are value trap , unless they are allowed by the promoters to run professionally they will continue to be a wealth destroyer.
1460 2018-09-06 14:53:44 2) Complicating the pilot with Trade At or even printing restrictions would directly cost investors money who matched off exchange and corrupt market structure

3) Failing to include a bucket of lower tick sizes (0.5 cents) for stocks "pinned" to 1 cent spreads biased the data
1461 2018-09-06 14:53:43 $GWPH falling with market on no volume. Annoying but holding for long term unless stocks really crack up.
1462 2018-09-06 14:53:42 I see. I used to be okay with banning just semi-automatic rifles like AR-15s but this gungrabbing BS from #MarchForOurLies (not a typo) has made me against banning even bump stocks. The federal ban on automatic rifles after 1980 something or whatever should remain though.

1466 2018-09-06 14:52:32 FAANG is an acronym for the market's five most popular and best-performing tech stocks, namely Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet’s Google. FAANG was born out of the original acronym, FANG, which did not have Apple included when CNBC’s Jim Cramer coined the term.
1467 2018-09-06 14:52:00 why is GWPH so weak as compared to most cannabis related stocks?

1471 2018-09-06 14:51:13 Tweetstorm alert!  As documented in the adopting release, several of us "commenters" predicted that it would fail and cost investors money for multiple reasons:  1) Widening spreads of stocks that had average spreads lower than 2.5 cents would impose costs, with no benefit
1472 2018-09-06 14:50:58 going to be funny to watch the panic out of tech stocks for the next three weeks    you see it in semis and social media and it will spread...the group herd mentallity     then in oct when earnings come you will see a huge run into the end of the year
1473 2018-09-06 14:50:56 Tell me about it, not touching these stocks.

1482 2018-09-06 14:49:31 I think for weed stocks it's kind of like biotech was, especially in the old days.  Mostly charlatans and people with no business sense but with an underlying secular story which should lead to a few big winners.
1483 2018-09-06 14:49:26 I am focused and seen inflation go up  Seen businesses close there doors, Seen many businesses buy back their own stocks and pay their CEO bigly. Just because the stock market is booming and can crash anytime don't mean anything for the average person.

1492 2018-09-06 14:46:43 It would help put pressure on the industry & our politicians to reform the industry & protect our native wild salmon stocks from infection from sea lice.

1493 2018-09-06 14:46:29 It is the most apt for stuff like bitcoin exactly because of your description.  Didn't people used to say green field?  Or is that too much of a pun for the cannabis stocks?

1520 2018-09-06 14:40:20 um i mean, im pretty sure stocks drop all of the time like this?? isn't that why people say buy low sell high

1555 2018-09-06 14:29:33 Ever since putting a status up about buying @Nike stock I’ve gotten several requests from young black men and women on how to set up a brokerage account and how to buy stocks. Sharing the knowledge and helping people invest is great! Teaching how to put that dollar to good use
1556 2018-09-06 14:29:18 They tell you what stocks there watching and how to attack it. What to look for when so you make a sane and confident judgment. It's not an alert service. I have made more trades with confidence and seen more constant green than I have ever b4. My next step now is sizing properly
1557 2018-09-06 14:27:55 hi! the maker isn't producing them anymore, we're purchasing them from a supplier who still has stocks so very limited quantity left

1565 2018-09-06 14:25:40 The big tech names have quite a bit of profit, and it makes sense that portfolios rebalance as they become overweight in these popular stocks. They sell tech and buy defensive names. Once portfolios are rebalanced these stocks will be bought... AMZN AAPL NVDA...etc...etc...

1683 2018-09-06 13:56:35 Hey Ganesh, don't worry, Our second sale will begin on 11th September 2018, 12 PM. We would be having enough stocks stay tuned to Flipkart as we can't ensure. Thanks
1684 2018-09-06 13:56:13 We're seeing short-sellers coming out of the woodwork in #cannabis stocks starting @ 3PM yest and continued this morn.  Usual suspects: $TLRY $CGC $CRON + periphery lower, too.  We're looking to re-enter some of the names that got away on p/b's, preferably at support levels.
1685 2018-09-06 13:56:12 Some positives over the last week: Dow has held up very well. $IJT $XLI and $IWM showing relative strength.  September is usually a bullish month for stocks.
1686 2018-09-06 13:55:51 I bought stocks. Buy low it will go high and you make money if you smart 
1687 2018-09-06 13:55:45 Their stocks went up lmao
1688 2018-09-06 13:54:59 It's funny when US-listed cannabis stocks like $CGC $CRON $TLRY run, they don't pull up other cannabis stocks with them, but when they sell off, they pull them down. $ACB $APH $FIRE
1689 2018-09-06 13:54:21 Best way to play would be put spreads on stocks or long Vol. Lot of positive signals of late Jan stage. Before Vol exploded.
1690 2018-09-06 13:54:15 I thought so too. Spoke to the guy at GTS, who handles all the stocks. He said they opened up and no code inside the Standard Edition. I asked about the Special Edition, he spoke to Sony India and got back to me, said no pre order bonus for any physical edition.

1707 2018-09-06 13:48:13 Even shows in the market. Stocks, dollar based, and American stock issued is valued higher as investment in the US business is at its best opportunity in years on a 5 year outlook. All things dollar based point up and hold a stronger value.

1803 2018-09-06 13:07:54 Parce que ça ne dépend pas que du prix du baril (il y a aussi les stocks, la variation de la demande,etc). Il faut aussi surtout prendre en compte le taux de change €/$ ainsi les taxes du gouvernement sur le gasoil et l’essence.

1870 2018-09-06 12:44:10 Something that I think would greatly benefit workers everywhere is to recall stocks from investors and instead give all the stocks to employees.

1891 2018-09-06 12:32:32 Afaik the case was brought by someone who's pension was to be c£70k + p/a and was due c£19k from PPF.

It'll get complicated given PPF typically less generous, escalation wise, than typical DB therefore what starts at >50% may fall below over time.

1894 2018-09-06 12:32:06 The statistics about most traders failing refers to Spreadbetting - which by it's nature encourages day trading. More likely to be whipsawed in/out of positions then. Likewise many 'investors' buy story stocks that never go anywhere in the long run. Same end result as you say.

1901 2018-09-06 12:27:31 What am I missing with stockpiling , do we immediately do whatever the EU says when the stocks run out ? If so, what is the point ?
1902 2018-09-06 12:27:13 The drop in China stocks is good, in my opinion. Trump is trying to get China to capitulate in the trade talks and the sharper the fall in stocks the closer we are to China's capitulation and a new trade agreement.

1912 2018-09-06 12:20:53 stocks have already lost 5% -10%, just with the fear of impeachment
1913 2018-09-06 12:20:32 See for yourself. Higher priced stocks maintain gains better. In the last month alone REGN has gone up a little over $45.00/share, and maintained most of it. These are working out to be better plays for me.
1914 2018-09-06 12:20:25 I deliver appliances for a living and i deliver to some very wealthy people. On occasion, i ask them what they do for a living. 99.999% of those people say stocks and bonds or real estate. The plan is simple and i cant wait for #financialfreedom. #btc #ETH $hot #Crypto #trx
1915 2018-09-06 12:20:04 It  would be interesting to know if they still get paid to keep stocks - it was the case 30 years ago when I was briefly involved.  If so are the government going to pay more?
1916 2018-09-06 12:18:33 @Seasonsart quand est-ce que tu refais tes stocks ?
1917 2018-09-06 12:18:32 It’s one thing for the stocks to stabilize! But another to watch their sales  collapse
1918 2018-09-06 12:17:44 My aunt just called me talking about buying couple shares of Nike stock.
I’m so proud of her, I taught her well, at one point in time she ain’t no jack about buying stocks.
1919 2018-09-06 12:17:28 Facts and they stocks probably cheap
1920 2018-09-06 12:17:14 Et oui tous les stocks sont déjà épuisés...
1921 2018-09-06 12:16:58 We decimated fish stocks, it's only with EU intervention that numbers have started to rise. We can't be trusted to manage our seas.
1922 2018-09-06 12:16:19 Marijuana Stocks $TLRY, $CRON, $CGC will open off this morning...……..
1923 2018-09-06 12:16:13 Thanx, pls comment one chart just tagged u, thanks in advance
1924 2018-09-06 12:16:09 Exactly lol its gonna forever grow in some form or fashion and i want to flip houses  Big profit margin and get to set my own schedule, then reinvest portions into big stocks and  #Crypto. Gains all around for my family for generations to come 
1925 2018-09-06 12:15:51 Huge! manipulation in #banknifty.. @NSEIndia please have some plan to reduce manipulation by adding more stocks in Banknifty components. #nifty is quite resilient that way.. 
1926 2018-09-06 12:15:11 Not a chance in hell, lol,,,,, it may run, it may not but I know it’s a turd in the end. 
1927 2018-09-06 12:14:03 I come from an east coast fishing family and have previously worked in fisheries science. I applaud this sensible move by UK gov. Fishing all year round and to hell with the stocks is totally irresponsible and only about £££.

1930 2018-09-06 12:12:25 Hi Duwang, our Alpenfest will last for as long as our stocks last. They won't be re-stocked when they run out so we recommend you get there quick! Starts Thursday 13th!
1931 2018-09-06 12:12:22 my officemates pursuaded me to play for the lotto also and i told them if i win i would buy bh’s stocks  which, at this point for the boys’ fame, i dont think is even enough w the winning price
1932 2018-09-06 12:12:16 Conductor on the @MBTA_CR with his church shoes on discussing passionately how @Nike stocks lost 2% and he doesn’t feel bad for them. PAY ATTENTION TO THE MTICKET HOMIE!
1933 2018-09-06 12:12:12 EOD end of day?
1934 2018-09-06 12:11:42 Just trying to get to the “how are my stocks doing?” phase in my life as fast as possible
1935 2018-09-06 12:11:37 #Pot stocks falling pre open. $TLRY $CGC $CRON all down. I would avoid them but would not be surprised if they fight back. To crazy to buy or short here. I like $CGC long term & am looking 4 a chance 2 buy it back #Cannabis #MarijuanaStocks IMO strictly day trades today if U play
1936 2018-09-06 12:11:33 Rant: Tired of getting random dm’s from people that are automated asking me if I want to learn to trade #stocks. No. I’m not signing up for your bs scam. You don’t have a system that makes you consistently #profitable. If someone offers that, run.
1937 2018-09-06 12:11:01 Even with stocks dropping "SUPER LOW" they are still near the record high for nike. Investing now is buying in at such a high cost vs if you did it last year
1938 2018-09-06 12:10:58 Dow Futures are up 41-points right now coming off a tough day Wednesday for tech stocks.

1947 2018-09-06 12:08:02 “NiKe StOcK wEnT dOwN”, stocks went down in general on that day, had nothing to do with the #ColinKaepernick advertisement. That’d be like blaming #Nike for the #Japanearthquake

1950 2018-09-06 12:07:48 Bashers of Katusa:  Just to let you all know Marin in the last 9 months or so he called for 2 buyouts that have happened. He said he had 4 stocks because he thought they would get bought out.  He had Nevsun and Arizona Mining.  Both got bought out this year with Nevsun yesterday.

1955 2018-09-06 12:06:05 Does it mean that there are no longer under-valued stocks or are there other tools to identify them?
1956 2018-09-06 12:05:51 Nike has lost almost no market value from this boycott & is still going to continue at a positive rate of growth on their stocks. But this light hit nike took is not some steal for investors looking to get into the game. Their shares haven't even dropped $3 & already leveled out
1957 2018-09-06 12:05:11 US futures edge higher for opening bell this morning.  Marajuana stocks soared yesterday then settled........ let's see what happens today with $TLRY, $CRON, $CGC.... also watching $LUV over the next couple of weeks to rise.  Happy Trading..........
1958 2018-09-06 12:04:59 Yea I realize it’s slower but doesn’t it feel awful to just play out two stocks? Like at least make it three. If you die once it’s already super close
1959 2018-09-06 12:04:55 When nifty made new highs a few months back, we had more stocks making 52 weeks high.. Now nifty making new highs and more stocks making 52 weeks low. This is not a bull run. Its more of a theatrical show of strength.
1960 2018-09-06 12:04:21 Looks good for my Canadian pot stocks! Up 30% in a WEEK!
1961 2018-09-06 12:04:15 @RailwaySeva PNR 8109354304 there no water proper in coach. Attenden not provide napkin after requesting three to four times. Materials stocks in toilet and locked are not working. Plz help us.
1962 2018-09-06 12:03:46 This is exactly why I've begun moving out of their price range into heftier stocks like REGN. The half assed, ultra stupid traders can't afford those stocks, so they're not as prone to this level of absurdity. Robinhood was the worst thing to ever happen to the market.
1963 2018-09-06 12:03:00 From my own experience NOT true.... I get paid a living wage, medical benefits for my family (4), monthly bonuses, and stocks. --> NOT on public assistance. 
1964 2018-09-06 12:02:47 TINA has gone to US stocks, finally. At least for anyone with any risk appetite. Otherwise just buy t-bills, especially as trade and global pmis roll over.
1965 2018-09-06 12:02:00 The gap between the market’s dividend yield and bond yield has never been as wide since then, should be signaling the appeal of British stocks, as long as earnings are on the up and up
1966 2018-09-06 12:01:52 Bad day for stocks across the board yesterday.

Will see how positions hold up.

1970 2018-09-06 12:00:14 OptionHacker alerted traders to bullish unusual option activity in 10 stocks Tuesday including $MRVL, $PENN and  $TECK.   Top performer was a same-day gain of 188% in $AMD where September 29.0 calls bought for $0.21 closed at $0.60.
1971 2018-09-06 12:00:11 Has the economy really been reborn? And if so, for whom? Certainly not the middle class. If you don’t own stocks, & don’t make $500k +, I’d argue you’re worse off with rising costs & stagnant wages. That’s 95% of us, even if the top 5-10% are benefiting.

1976 2018-09-06 11:56:57 @SenateGOP @HouseGOP the stock market IS NOT the economy. Most Americans don’t own stocks. 51% of income in America goes to the top 1% of the population. You voted to take healthcare away. What HAVE you done to help the other 99%?

1979 2018-09-06 11:56:26 Ashutosh, I'm not a SEBI reg. adviser so I can not suggest which stocks to buy or sell. I only post my views on how a company or a sector is performing. It is in no way any recommendation to Buy or to Sell a particular stock.
1980 2018-09-06 11:56:22 I'm going to have to buy stocks in tin foil.

1983 2018-09-06 11:55:53 It's all about money with you, isn't it Donnie?
What about: healthcare, infrastructure, gun violence, the rise of hate crimes?
Oh, and remember when you accused other Republicans of being "afraid of the NRA"? You couldn't even follow through on bump stocks.  You are a  fraud.
1984 2018-09-06 11:54:46 Yeah those are probably easier stocks to short than $TSLA as they will face alot of disruption by Tesla. I am in fact short Ford $F.
1985 2018-09-06 11:54:36 What is the criteria you apply to arrive at these stocks...
1986 2018-09-06 11:54:36 I have done a massive amount of soul searching this last week in regards to my trading.  My plan is starting to become clearer and clearer.  I keep finding myself drawn towards stocks and stock options so I am going to spend some time learning about how options work. #trading
1987 2018-09-06 11:54:29 Buying on credit b/c you feel confident won’t pay the bills when they come in. Especially with the 20% APR that banks charge!  Banks & ppl who have stocks are doing great but the rest if us wont get out of debt until we have affordable healthcare & housing.
1988 2018-09-06 11:54:17 Hot POT stocks for today... $NBEV $TLRY $CRON ... NBEV just started yesterday at 3:30pm... could run for days to come!
1989 2018-09-06 11:54:14 Rubbish.  EU equal access, minimum prices & up size grants caused overfishing. UK wasn't free to do different.

1992 2018-09-06 11:52:35 Both Russell 2000 and S&P 500 Indices are testing their “summer” breakouts now. The breadth on NYSE stocks has deteriorated, but at the oversold zone for v short term.

1995 2018-09-06 11:51:13 They're not getting killed, though...The people who are the most pissed off and who I've seen threatening to boycott aren't even Nike's key demographic. The stocks dropped a little but sales that day surged. Nike will be fine. Just like Dick's, Starbucks, Target, etc.
1996 2018-09-06 11:51:10 I’ll admit, like many other investors & creditors, I am furious over a lot of money that I lost in Engro stocks & bonds back in 2012 when the company almost sank.
1997 2018-09-06 11:51:03 @SM_RETIRERICH sir thank you very much for all the educational videos .just need to check one thing sir tht in ur lifetime membership you give technical buy/sell calls also on stocks to your member community or it is only a broad educational platform

2007 2018-09-06 11:47:42 of course it's crazy talk, without a potential equal or near equal enemy how do my military industrial complex stocks stay afloat? without those how will I be able to pay the organization that lobbies for more foreign aid that funds those investments? Jeeze!
2008 2018-09-06 11:46:39 A guard or two with guns would probably do it.  But part of the stocks is the experience of being publicly reduced to dependence upon others and open to the powerlessness they caused others.  The wronged, if not stones, could certainly bring rotten tomatoes or take selfies with.

2012 2018-09-06 11:44:18 I just think that if they don't deliver this fight after all the promises then it's going to make Warren, Fury, Wilder and Finkle all laughing stocks and make Hearn look good which none of them want. That's the only real hope I've got that this gets made.

2014 2018-09-06 11:41:55 Leinster's back row stocks are overrated, Heaslip and Ryan just retired, Jordi and Timmins are gone, SOB has been injured for a year, Connors just got a career threatening injury. JVDF isn't under threat from anyone. He's not from RSA, his grandad immigrated here from Holland.
2015 2018-09-06 11:41:39 Apart from this year we know why they are liquidating stocks it’s to pump crypto have exit strategies ready because one thing is for sure they will wreck this market when they come into it
2016 2018-09-06 11:41:29 "As stocks went down, #TLT rose. A sign of things to come when the stock market crashes. Commercials are massively long UST bonds. They will be right again. #Crash coming.

2018 2018-09-06 11:40:04 No!!!! I mean for defensive stocks if someone goes down in our backline. Is he better than Dea or Hartley who seem to be called up first when defenders go down? I’m just asking. Maybe this Ellis bloke IS better than these two. I don’t know? 
2019 2018-09-06 11:39:58 It's a serious threat to the church's 1 billion plus dollars worth of pharmaceutical stocks.
2020 2018-09-06 11:39:45 I'm an investor and often feel like selling stocks on day when the colour of my portfolio is predominantly red but I realise that's doing it incorrectly.
Oft said but, "buy low sell high", is harder to do than we think. If we suss it, we make money.
2021 2018-09-06 11:39:27 The stocks are collectively plummeting due to standoff trade talks and Twitter & Facebook senate hearings. Bad weather—short-term volatility.
2022 2018-09-06 11:39:06 Prosperous for who?

I haven't seen any increase in pay nor any tax break. In fact I paid more in taxes last year, probably more this year?

I can't afford stocks, investment for me is buying an automobile or a home & neither is currently worth what was paid for them.

2024 2018-09-06 11:38:03 As a Canadian picking stocks I always took note of America’s GDP and under Obama it looked to averaged a disappointing 1.8 - 2.2 % which seemed forever. In comes Trump & in 1 year he goes & doubles America’s GDP. Thanks Obama LOL

2028 2018-09-06 11:36:19 People said stocks were overvalued in ‘16, yet here we are. Millennials shouldn’t try to time the market when it drops, but invest periodically (dollar cost average) over time. Growing wealth is about setting up a system that takes emotions & speculation out & puts consistency in
2029 2018-09-06 11:35:45 Keep counting your stock. Cause soon you won't have much to count. I noticed a significant increase also. But I'd trade my stocks for #trump to care about us. Don't you see. Your stocks went up just imagine what the fat cats now get. Good day

2032 2018-09-06 11:33:54 I think we should put @revnapalm and all Hants fans in the stocks and hurl rotten tomatoes at them. Some of my sour grapes might be useful too

2036 2018-09-06 11:30:57 The trouble with the stocks is, how do you stop bypassers chucking stones at the person in stocks? Quite a few people died pretty nasty deaths in the stocks. How about the stocks in a glass box?
2037 2018-09-06 11:30:48 Ahh I see! ;; The stocks are not limited-time only though, so there's no need to worry about it running out of stock as well! ;w; <3

2060 2018-09-06 11:17:37 From May '18 (when it was possibly first published) to today, the list has shrunk even further. Either the stocks are all over-valued now or the criteria is too stringent.

Lucky for us, the stocks went down, which means that those interested in buying them can make some serious $$$

2075 2018-09-06 11:11:27 Ding ding ding! Exactly! I can get behind hunting rifles to a point, but our access to military style weapons is absurd. Hell, I can even say a revolver for self defense. But 30 rounds in a clip for a 9mm? Banana clips on AKs with bump stocks? Give me a break.

2084 2018-09-06 11:08:36 Graduating in 2009 was a bad break, but I think it may have enhanced my risk tolerance. If anything it showed me how important stocks are for a portfolio given the time horizon of a millennial who has many years to work: and is going to need them.

2095 2018-09-06 11:04:44 I am very disappointed that their stocks have risen since the 1st day this information came out. They went down 7 points the 1st day and now they are up.

2122 2018-09-06 10:41:47 Lots of stocks in the red today. I am anticipating a blue week for #GGP next week - especially when the 3D results are published.
2123 2018-09-06 10:41:39 Sure, but most don’t. Two-thirds of Americans don’t have access to or don’t use a 401k.

The top 10% of Americans own over 80% of the total value of stocks.

46% of Americans own zero in stocks.

So the vast majority of the gains are going to just a few people at the top.

2134 2018-09-06 10:38:30 I'm guessing this was the cause of the dip in US/Can u3o8 stocks late trading yesterday? Power plant is now back on normal power.
2135 2018-09-06 10:38:23 That's why Nike s stocks crashed. They lost 40 billion dollars.

Nor has it been the case at any time during my tenure here.  As a FT employee, I get affordable benefits, living wage, stocks, bonuses, real bathrooms...
2156 2018-09-06 10:24:28 tak an ko ah. gusto ko mag bakal sang Adidas Falcon kaso kay limited stocks lg and sa Makati/Taguig lg avail nga stores, maunahan naman ko ni sg mga artista. Tsk.
2157 2018-09-06 10:24:05 Sorry for your losses. You must have noticed increase in failed breakouts and quick melt up in gains of other stocks. Reminds me of deteriorating market condition like earlier years before market took a hit.
2158 2018-09-06 10:23:13 Do you trade the index or the individual stocks?
2159 2018-09-06 10:22:33 Hi Param, just curious, do you only long stocks? All of your trades seem to be long even in a day like this.
2160 2018-09-06 10:21:30 Wanna hear what's going on in the FC in WA?  Living wage.  Stocks.  Bonuses.  Full benefits.  Climate controlled FC.  Full meal/break periods.  Clean (cleaner than anywhere I've worked in the last 10 years.) Secure facility (which is a huge plus for someone with DV PTSD)
2161 2018-09-06 10:21:04 Hi Craig, this will be an ongoing thing until stocks last.
2162 2018-09-06 10:20:37 I did, but what if they dont have any stocks now? 
2163 2018-09-06 10:20:28 Well Nike just lost BILLIONS IN STOCKS so that’s a start! to you!
2164 2018-09-06 10:19:32 I completely agree.  Wages should reflect skills and experience.  We all start off at the same base rate, for the job we were hired to do.  BUT, we also get bi-annual raises the first 2 years, monthly incentive bonuses, stocks, full benefits package, 401k & opps to promote.
2165 2018-09-06 10:19:11 I do major in stocks only. Bank nifty for Twitter !!

2168 2018-09-06 10:17:20 It feels like the US tech stocks may be finally running out of steam. S&P 500 struggling for the next leg up. I’m buying put options in #QQQ and calls in #GDXJ

2173 2018-09-06 10:14:54 No idea. I'm making historical VolSkew charts for the Indices & stocks. Will get to know how the underlying performed with respect to VolSkew or vice-versa. Will be another data point in trading.

2175 2018-09-06 10:13:24 Free stocks in the company throughout my career are actually part of my compensation package as a FT associate.  I also get a living wage, full benefits, freedom to use the restrooms whenever I need to, full breaks/lunch period.  #IpeewhenIneedto #thisarticleisso2016
2176 2018-09-06 10:10:52 it’s 6am meaning I’m looking at  my stocks and trying to figure out my moves for the day....as in what to buy vs. what to unload....it’s almost the weekend and seeing a longtime vision is definitely the most important thing..especially when you are starting out small like me
2177 2018-09-06 10:09:47 How are they going to pay for these stocks? They just wouldn't have the cash flow so the only way is to pass it on to the consumer.

2186 2018-09-06 10:02:17 Well I could. Small and medium size buisness will come out better. Regulation, ie that CE mark on goods, costs a fortune to obtain. Hopefully we regain our fish stocks which have been decimated. I have more......

2254 2018-09-06 09:16:30 I am no expert but today FIIs were bearish on Index and Stocks (according to the data on your site).
But we still saw a bull run. While DIIs were long on stocks.

That's why i said FIIs lose.
P.S. This is just my observation and i may be wrong.

2286 2018-09-06 08:54:55 Oh, come on, we haven't got through the cheese stocks we saved when we joined the Common Market, to take advantage of prices before the French raised them 40 yrs ago! 
2287 2018-09-06 08:53:47 We are hired, to do a job.  Our wages are based on said job.  A fair wage, (I currently make approx $15) that is given to every person that was hired to do that job in the same FC.  On top of that, as a FT associate, I get an affordable benefits package, bonuses and stocks.

2293 2018-09-06 08:48:36 I might regret it but I've sold my VAL now. Made 120% on it so I'm still happy. I did sell half when it hit 100% but too many times I've seen my stocks drift back and I've ended up making a lot less profit.  Where to add to next, #AllocationOfCapital ;-)
2294 2018-09-06 08:48:00 I make my standard pay, right around $15/hr before bonuses and stocks, whether I'm working on social media or working the FC floor.  The only perk is the ability to tell my Amazon story to fine folks, like you, on Twitter.

2303 2018-09-06 08:44:30 Stocks dropped 25% during the financial crisis just ten years ago. Equity markets are trash!  Look at currencies in Iran and Venezuela. Fiat currencies are trash! You need to have some better arguments than price volatility in a brand new market.

2341 2018-09-06 08:15:41 Just as important as last year's snow. Their stocks did take a dip, that's what usually happens when you make controversial business decisions - investors will leave you, because they don't want to take that risk.

2419 2018-09-06 07:11:26 Recent breakouts were suspicious , with low volume and RS lines not on new high, so this sell off was not suprise. May be now the stocks will set up better. But it is interesting , there are not fear in the market even after such a bad day.

Expect utilities, such as water and electricity will go up due to Foreign Currency Adjustment, petroleum products going up due to peso depreciation...

2544 2018-09-06 05:41:53 the "market" owns those stocks. Nike didn't lose anything.
2545 2018-09-06 05:41:40 Obama set the trajectory. All trump had to do is not screw it up. Obama almost tripled the market, and that was without all of the corporations blowing up the numbers by buying back their own stocks instead of growing their businesses like they're doing now.
2546 2018-09-06 05:41:07 There is no success in this president at all other than stocks went up and that’s just cause 1% is getting billions in tax cuts that’s only thing. Other than that administration had been promoting lies and bullying and prostitution

2548 2018-09-06 05:39:34 #IstandwithKap #IstandwithNike  BTW, Nike’s stocks are up. Massive respect to all who serve, who protect our freedom. My point of view regarding this issue doesn’t change that respect; doesn’t discount the magnitude of your sacrifice. #ikneel for the “Liberty and justice for all”

2552 2018-09-06 05:37:54 Just the way skipper Virat Kohli’s heroics could not save India from going 1-3 down to England in the ongoing Test series, a strong show by a couple of heavyweight stocks is failing to hold the fort for ‘Team India’ on Dalal Street.
2553 2018-09-06 05:36:38 I'm hoping there will be some agreement in the scallop fishing dispute. The balance has to be there to protect livelihoods on both sides of the channel and preserve stocks.

2571 2018-09-06 05:25:21 To the idiots that don’t know how stock works, yes @nike stock went down because a political statement is always risky. That being said, stocks are never about the short term and Nike stocks have, for the most part, been rising. They’ll probably rise in a week when this passes
2572 2018-09-06 05:23:26 #stocksocial i have 625 shares of Bhansali polymers (BEPL) @ 168 rs what's your view on it and also have 110 shares of Mahindra lifespaces @ 623 rs please guide me on both these stocks.
2573 2018-09-06 05:22:44 It really is! The truth is that such actions will not impact Nike. At all. If you disagree that strongly with the honour being bestowed upon Kaepernick, don't buy more Nike products when yours wear out. Dump their stocks. Refuse to engage with anything they support or sponsor.
2574 2018-09-06 05:20:15 This is a fact pattern we are seeing time and time again these days, huge corporations led by leftists and communists globalists and criminals are signed up for a Us Citizen perma-last agenda, whatever is good for us, they are very aggressively against. So we boycott, sink stocks

2585 2018-09-06 05:13:35 If you’re logical then buying stocks of companies should also be prohibited. It allocates resources to malinvestments, promoting the destruction of companies and economies. The fair price is a random event, a competition (Samuelson (1965)). It’s important to have balance.

2591 2018-09-06 05:09:39 How to own the libs:

1) Buy Nike gear
2) Buy A LOT of it. Empty your savings.
3) Maybe buy some stocks too, for extra ownage.
4) Spend every cent you ever make on more and more Nike shit
5) Burn all of it
6) Laugh at the libs - your house is foreclosed but totally worth it!

2612 2018-09-06 04:56:32 You should fact check that. Subs are up and stocks are up. They got a few pulitzers too. They have been around for almost 167 years for a reason. There is nothing diminishing about the NYT.
2613 2018-09-06 04:55:56 now is the time to buy some nike stocks bc once y’all stop being so sensitive
2614 2018-09-06 04:55:20 So what exactly are you looking at?  To help you, the red means down.  And if you look at ALL of the stocks, Nike is DOWN a total of <78.41>.  So you were saying????
2615 2018-09-06 04:54:34 Reminder for everyone. Whether in crypto or stocks or life in general.

A risk free life is unheard of. That’s why you need to hedge it. Diversify, and build an effective professional network “THAT WORKS FOR YOU”

2629 2018-09-06 04:43:42 No ur right when it comes to the market there are a lot of factors that have causality. Buuut Comparing those stocks 5 day out come to Nike. You see a rapid drop or the Woke Slide more profoundly than other stocks that are suffering from Trumps bolstering trade war.

2665 2018-09-06 04:04:16 YOU are the reason I dumped all my Nike stocks.

I would create a "I dont know shit about stocks and the market" meme, but that just for lazy people.

2675 2018-09-06 04:00:37 You still don't understand the difference between stocks and flows.  Greenhouse gases don't store the heat, they regulate how fast it passes from the surface to space.  If the flow rate is slowed, the surface warms, and that increases the flow from the surface.

2681 2018-09-06 03:56:56 Such a confusing opening... No direction neither in index, neither in stocks.
2682 2018-09-06 03:56:20 The incompetence of the left has been on full display for the whole world to see.  All I can say is have fun during the midterms Nancy and Chuck.  Unemployment down, record numbers in stocks and 4% GDP. And they want to raise our taxes and resist.  What do they stand for?

2690 2018-09-06 03:46:24 20= 1/4 of a Nike stock, I buy all my stocks incrementally so in a month I’ll have a full stock. I play the long game on my student budget you unintelligible dork and my investment portfolio is over 10%+ in gains from operating as such.
2691 2018-09-06 03:46:18 well, ABS CBN is not picking up... I think they're on their all time low (LOL!) best time to buy their stocks.  Also, UITFs in BDO are down (I do not fully understand it as much why) so if you got some, don't sell yet.  If you got money to buy, this is probably the right time.
2692 2018-09-06 03:44:41 @Trevornoah (cont,  part 3, the end I hope) I was saying that I'm buying Nike stocks tomorrow,  not because I believe Nike has Kapernik's best interests at heart, but to encourage more corporations to be Nike instead of Chick-fil-a.
2693 2018-09-06 03:44:28 (3) It took Obama 6 years to do such a thing with high welfare and low job confidence.

But I usually cite the bull market on Nov, 9th. 2016. I has been going strong since.

The only change was Obama was on his way out then. Stocks don't like.

2704 2018-09-06 03:39:19 Yeah, or one life only. Multiple stocks on a shrinking battlefield zone wouldn’t fit properly. One stock, all items on, last man standing. Problem is, how should final smashes work.. maybe just that Meter thing and no ball.
2705 2018-09-06 03:35:54 I Dead ass get excited talking about stocks and other means of investing

2724 2018-09-06 03:23:43 So it's been 36 days without looking at the stock screen. Haven't checked the prices of the stocks I have nor the NAV of the MFs. Started new investments in MF n Index funds only by looking at my portfolio n goals. Thanks to all the online teachers for the advise
2725 2018-09-06 03:23:27 i daytrade 4 days/wk, usually just the morning session. i sold my 2 practices early 2017 & now working 4 another company as a senior employee. was over being a business owner & the stress that comes with it. happy 2 have an easy day job so i can focus my mental capacity on stocks
2726 2018-09-06 03:23:14 @MikeCompany17 hey I just wanted to let you know that you’ve inspired me to take a Wall Street class at my school to learn more about how stocks can determine the failure or success of a company and I really like it so far thank you!
2727 2018-09-06 03:22:40 That or their stocks.
2728 2018-09-06 03:22:29 So POTUS is unstable and erratic?  Well I hope he doesn’t change!  Economy is booming so is consumer confidence employment and GDP stocks etc!  Keep on being crazy!

2731 2018-09-06 03:20:54 Look at Nike’s stocks today. This isn’t hard.
2732 2018-09-06 03:20:20 In N Out stocks just increased 
2733 2018-09-06 03:19:50 Where was the tweet from today about sneaker stocks? All were down except for Nike. Why no mention of it? Smh.
2734 2018-09-06 03:18:52 They don't have stock or mutual funds but they have NIKES? They could have had bought some cheap stocks with the money t hat it cost to buy the Nikes but they choose sneakers and wonder why they are still broke.
2735 2018-09-06 03:17:55 The far bigger issue is borrowing money to fund buybacks and leverage their balance sheets. Buybacks have put a serious floor under stocks. As rates rise they will not be able to do so. Anyone that doesn’t think this will be a problem going forward is crazy.

2780 2018-09-06 02:56:48 Most U.S. stocks fell, with FANG shares tumbling as executives of the tech heavyweights faced scrutiny on Capitol Hill. The selloff in emerging market assets deepened, adding to the risk-off tone on global financial markets.
The yield on 10yr Treasuries was stuck just below 2.90%
2781 2018-09-06 02:56:47 US stocks mostly fell on Wednesday, with the technology sector logging its worst single-day decline since late July as Facebook and Twitter executives testified on Capitol Hill about online misinformation

2791 2018-09-06 02:53:47 That won't happen. Just chill and enjoy the booming economy, soaring stocks, record unemployment, more jobs, 400% growth in black businesses,  fair trade deal with Mexico, stronger military, etc. Plus he is draining the swamp. Thank you President Trump!
2792 2018-09-06 02:53:43 Momentum trading is about following the market trend and not timing the market. Some stocks go up even in a falling market and vice versa.
2793 2018-09-06 02:53:39 I invested in a stock 2 years ago worth 2 pennis bout 1500 stocks but pulled out to buy something for @Ryblank00 the stock I bought got to be worth eventually 65000 dollars I now know I'm my own worst enemy
2794 2018-09-06 02:53:23 Go grab some stocks in adidas and other brands they about to rise

2797 2018-09-06 02:51:59 Nike made a very bad move sponsoring @Kaepernick7 . Almost as if they threw half of their profit in the ocean. I’ll be watching the stocks on it. Be a good time to sell their stock...
2798 2018-09-06 02:51:59 Lol but when Christmas come Nike stocks is going skyrocket RT @StretchMyBandz: Shut up punk
2799 2018-09-06 02:51:52 I’m brought 5k worth of Nike Stocks... Understand this was a good move .
2800 2018-09-06 02:51:36 @FoxBusiness This guy, really? Brags about moving the stocks he “reports on”? May as well be @FoxNews

2801 2018-09-06 02:51:12 @sahneydeepak Sirji.. With ban lifted on construction.. Do u see jump in cement stocks today? Any particular script that catches your eye?
2802 2018-09-06 02:50:20 I said that through the first half. I love Mindy but she just didn’t gel. However I loved how she nailed everyone in the gang. The end was fantastic!
2803 2018-09-06 02:50:16 Won't be happening. Just enjoy the booming economy, soaring stocks, lower taxes, record unemployment, more jobs, 400% growth in black businesses,  fair trade deal with Mexico, stronger military, etc. Thank you President Trump!
2804 2018-09-06 02:48:41 interesting.. thanks for the explanation.. Was never brave enough to deal with such stocks.. either direction
2805 2018-09-06 02:48:18 David, I am on your side I believe our Congress and Senate are owned by the NRA and I believe that assault rifles and bump stocks and regulations to own a gun are important but there are also other things that are just as imp. Racism, women's rights, children put in cages etc
2806 2018-09-06 02:47:06 Trump is draining the corrupt swamp while we all enjoy lower taxes, record low unemployment, more jobs, 400% growth in black businesses,  fair trade deal with Mexico, booming economy, soaring stocks, stronger and respected military, etc. Thank you President Trump!

2809 2018-09-06 02:45:20 Your calls in NIFTY AND BANK NIFTY r good. But not in stocks.
U r not reminding of negative calls. what happened to RAMCO CEMENT?

2810 2018-09-06 02:44:22 I started investing in stocks and now I’m a business man gotta secure the bagg
2811 2018-09-06 02:44:14 Can you imagine what Mask company stocks are like in the @ThePurgeTV universe?
2812 2018-09-06 02:44:12 Well, Dick's sporting goods is still open and doing well. And I'm pretty sure I saw stocks going back up again for Nike, so, get over yourself you racist 
2813 2018-09-06 02:43:23 The word we're looking for is speculation. If you think a bunch of baby boomers pulling their stocks dictates what happens in store you're silly. We all know nike went straight at it's base. The cashflow that's about to come is going to make you're chart guys very sad.

2814 2018-09-06 02:42:30 Damn if i had the money id buy nike stocks right now.
2815 2018-09-06 02:41:59 Ofcourse not. Just enjoy the booming economy, soaring stocks, record low unemployment, more jobs, 400% growth in black businesses,  fair tr as de deal with Mexico, stronger military, etc. Thank you President Trump.
2816 2018-09-06 02:41:40 stocks?
2817 2018-09-06 02:41:30 I’ve owned weed stocks since 2016, call em whatever you want just keeping buying my bags.
2818 2018-09-06 02:41:09 Nike has already almost recovered the loss. Probably what happened it the folks bent out of shape sold their stocks. Then the other side retaliated by buying it back up in support. Nothing to do with fat idiots burning clothes and sneakers.
2819 2018-09-06 02:40:35 You don't see that very often: 
It's 11:40am in Japan right now on Thursday, and all of the 50 Japanese gaming stocks I regularly track are red.
2820 2018-09-06 02:40:30 Bear market in crypto, bear market in stocks, bear market in real estate  joke on them because I am@in it for the long run. Just bought a lot of ramen
2821 2018-09-06 02:40:27 False. Bump stocks can't turn a gun fully automatic. They're aren't a substitute for machining. M4s are still deadlier because of things like select fire, differences in velocity and twist, etc. And a .45 handgun is more powerful than an AR. Should they be banned?
2822 2018-09-06 02:40:08 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
2823 2018-09-06 02:39:38 I didn’t either! But I made some money on my other pot stocks. Dude, AMD was another heartbreaker. I bought it 9$ and sold it at 15$. Lol Mubadala sold it at 20$. It’s at 27$ now. Could have tripled my money there!
2824 2018-09-06 02:39:23 Another was using the last 3 yrs avg. P/E for price target in building materials stocks. At least that was in your face...
2825 2018-09-06 02:39:22 You know I’m not really surprised that people are cutting and burning their clothing out of a #NikeBoycott. These same idiots are the ones who don’t get the reason behind #ColinKaepernick and the movement also they think They are hurting Nike. NEWS FLASH- Stocks finished UP
2826 2018-09-06 02:38:42 Replacing antiquated digital security certificates makes tons of sense.  There's no reason stocks should take T+2 days to settle. Not to mention proxy vote accountability, accounting improvements, etc.
2827 2018-09-06 02:38:19 Only from what I've learned over the past 5 months, I chose Stocks. Why?, long term investments. Put in the work now, and keep reinvesting.
2828 2018-09-06 02:37:51 And they are not the only ones. Just added $NKE on my list of never-to-own stocks/options - along with $FB and $TSLA of course. They can skyrocket but I would never invest in companies whose values I don't believe into

2831 2018-09-06 02:36:29 Make sure you’re not high on ambien because lately a whole lot of stupid crap comes out of you mouth or twitter and it tanks the value of my Tesla stocks. Just freakin step down if you’re tired of Tesla. Don’t sabotage it!
2832 2018-09-06 02:35:54 As an options trader, the expected price movement of a stock is factored into the options contracts as "Delta" and implied volitility. I look for stocks that are expected to make big moves in some direction because of headlines or upcoming reports etc, then enter neutral spread.
2833 2018-09-06 02:35:31 @Nike..Want to be controversial?So many ways to produce “shock value”.However,your latest decision will produce a shock to you when you see your stocks tank..You can still be controversial but also MORALLY RIGHT using the REAL HEROES of the past or present!SHAME ON YOU!Disgusted!

2842 2018-09-06 02:31:39 We're doing it all wrong.  We should order 4 Nike shirts a day and shoes every other day for 3 weeks.... then send them all back for a refund after their stocks soar.  They'll have to store the crap somewhere.  #BoycotNike

2860 2018-09-06 02:21:01 Further thought. The opportunity presents in stocks that can break away from the algo grasp. An example several on this string know is Wesdome.

It provided a compelling event & broke out, the fundy news was disruptive.

So don't just look for value, but for upcoming pzazz moment
2861 2018-09-06 02:20:28 Had @Nike enlisted @JJWatt for their #JustDoIt campaign, I’d reckon their stocks would be skyrocketing. I mean, the man did raise almost $40 million for hurricane relief. But hey, let’s hire @Kaepernick7 and watch our #NikeStock plummet. #Nike #Kaepernick #JJWatt #MAGA

2863 2018-09-06 02:20:16 The duality of craziness. 1. What is he sacrificing? He gets a great big fat pay check and is in the 1% and people are defending him, calling the boycott of Nike wrong 2. In-N-Out donates to both political parties equally and one side is calling for a boycott. Check both stocks.

2878 2018-09-06 02:11:31 Good evening. Two things. Y-axis says US stocks richly valued. X-axis shows that if interest rates keep rising, we can expect equity prices to come down.
2879 2018-09-06 02:11:20 Oh my... tech stocks.
2880 2018-09-06 02:10:47 They lost money to my understanding and they stocks are down
2881 2018-09-06 02:10:22 And now that big inflated cannabis stock companies make up a significantly huge part of the Canadian economy, the government can’t afford to let the values of those companies drop — so they can’t let more participants provide access & lower the price & destabilize pot stocks.
2882 2018-09-06 02:10:05 AR15s aren’t automatic, but the bump stocks can go. I don’t think most people realize you can put a 100 rnd drum on a pistol & have it become “automatic” as well.
2883 2018-09-06 02:09:54 Yea it’s crazy man. I was looking at stocks and Adidas has dropped as well. It looks like a few other have drop about the same as well.
2884 2018-09-06 02:09:06 Stocks are back up. all the shoe companies dipped for a little bit. 

That’s what happens with stocks. Do you think Trump’s 10k fans would make a dent in Nike? Especially over something as American as peaceful protest.

2888 2018-09-06 02:07:51 Stocks will again trade in fractions. MAGA is down five thirty eighths today on the big board.
2889 2018-09-06 02:07:24 They should put Colin Kaepernick's face on bump stocks.  We all can watch the Dotards destroy them.
2890 2018-09-06 02:06:38 Great!!! Do you trade just stocks or you do options as well? It must be very difficult to trade with same strategy all these years?

2892 2018-09-06 02:05:15 Long guns, if not automatic or having the ability to become automatic, are fine with me. 

But IMO the AR-15 is a weapon of mass killing and bump stocks ought to be seriously regulated.
2893 2018-09-06 02:04:51 I want to invest in some stocks but I’m not sure how 
2894 2018-09-06 02:04:40 TD Ameritrade, E-Trade, Charles Scwab. Trades are usually $5-$7 per transaction ( eegardless of how many shares you purchase).They also have research tools to help you analyze stocks.

    Most U.S. stocks fell, with FANG shares tumbling as executives of the tech heavyweights faced scrutiny on Capitol Hill. The selloff in emerging market assets deepened, adding to the risk-off tone on global financial markets.

2900 2018-09-06 02:03:17 Hit the snooze button on crypto.   Wait 5 years etc.  Still lurking twitter.  More interested in pot stocks.  
2901 2018-09-06 02:02:45 Because stocks never bounce back.
2902 2018-09-06 02:02:30 Nike pulls a lot of weight in the sports world and can afford to take political risks and other brands should follow. The Kaepernick ads are a small bump in the road that will probably not matter come the next quarter earning reports. Their stocks will bounce back #BakerSportLaw
2903 2018-09-06 02:02:18 That happens with stocks and ETFs also. Someone sells $100m and it falls 5%. Why does this mean we can’t have a bitcoin ETF? #funpolice
2904 2018-09-06 02:02:03 Nothing to do with the listed stocks.
2905 2018-09-06 02:01:52 For all the new people ..  Days ago  someone took a 74 Mil short against #Bitcoin , then mysteriously days later Goldman Sachs drops the news.  They are using the old Wall St tactics , and they might work short term, but unlike stocks where they can naked short indefinitely. (1)
2906 2018-09-06 02:01:51 Ladies and gentlemen, Nike didn't lose $3.75B because of The @CollinKapernick campaign All stocks fell massively today because most of them including Nike are at all time highs & due a sell off. #factsonly #boycottNike
2907 2018-09-06 02:01:45 That stocks already going back up. And if you don't think they calculated that dip then your the idiot.
2908 2018-09-06 02:01:43 Pro Tip:
-When receiving Dividend Payouts From Stocks—Do Not, Roll Money Automatically into Buying More Stock Shares. 
-From Brokers—These Dividend funds, are rolled as Market Orders. 
-Instead—Bank the Dividends, & Buy Stock With Limit Orders On Pullbacks.

2910 2018-09-06 02:01:17 @Nike made a shitty decision having #ColinKaepernick be the face of the brand. Since the announcement, the company’s stocks dropped 3%. 
2911 2018-09-06 02:00:31 Way I rationalize it to myself, its like stocks. Short term gains, long term investments, buy low sell high. Review the past 2 years of stats for a given player to see how likely they are to continue doing thier thing, if they are starting next gme, etc

2915 2018-09-06 01:58:50 Invest in stocks that give you monthly dividends. That means that pay you just for owning it. 50cent a month isn’t shit but if u keep buying that stock every month you’ll get paid enough in dividends that you can eat off that.
2916 2018-09-06 01:58:48 I think it’s funny people thought Nike was going tongonout of business! Stocks dropped, ppl talking so much stuff, Nike was silent. Then they came out today with the commercial....mic drop!!! Never underestimate the power of a powerful company!!!
2917 2018-09-06 01:58:39 Last player standing do you mean something like *STOCKS*
2918 2018-09-06 01:57:56 NIKES STOCKS WENT UP LMAOOO FUCK YOU WHITE AMERIKKKA

2920 2018-09-06 01:57:09 It has and will continue to have an impact on spinners stocks of the country in future as well.
County cricket now only produces 130kph trundlers who move the bowls because they play with duke ball on green pitches.
These guys don't require pace to be successful.
2921 2018-09-06 01:56:37 Nike stocks are up today you fool!!
2922 2018-09-06 01:55:38 Rudy, you have no credibility, Bob Woodward has credibility.  You and Donnie are laughing stocks.
2923 2018-09-06 01:55:37 But yet their stocks are up 
2924 2018-09-06 01:55:18 @LindseyGrahamSC U are contributing to the loss of Americans freedom and the Rule of Law: No one is above the law! With ur yes on Kavanaugh u are a conspirator in the subversion of the govt of the US and have broken ur oath to the Constitution! U shd be in Stocks on the Mall!
2925 2018-09-06 01:54:34 From US daw yung stocks sabi nung mga bumili 
2926 2018-09-06 01:54:22 Wowsers absolute bargain entry points for a few stocks atm. I’m looking at you $KRC & $TAW 
2927 2018-09-06 01:54:12 So what I am hearing is... Wait until after the opening game to buy some stocks 
2928 2018-09-06 01:54:01 The bitcoin stocks people are now trading cannabis stocks .. you get the picture
2929 2018-09-06 01:53:59 @maddow hey look @JustinTrudeau eye brows are in place
2930 2018-09-06 01:53:14 Minus the 3 billion in stocks plunging.
2931 2018-09-06 01:53:12 Weed stocks are grossly overvalued but there are still diamonds in the rough.
2932 2018-09-06 01:52:29 I’m inclined to think “lodestar” was a red herring planted to make us think it was Pence. Not one molecule in my body thinks Pence is man enough to bring 45 down from the inside. I think he wants 45 to stay because he loves the booming stocks, kids in cages and blatant racism.
2933 2018-09-06 01:52:19 Marco, Jeb, and McCain all had a hand in the beginning of the fake dossier
2934 2018-09-06 01:51:33 You basically confirm that it was nonsense to tell the world that Nike stocks were down solely because some ppl didn't agree with Kaepernick being the face on Nike.
2935 2018-09-06 01:51:33 I dont get how stocks can be going up if everyone hates on them 
2936 2018-09-06 01:50:53 went from 106 charts to 65... still need to trim down... but mostly have same stocks on multiple time frames... goodnight!
2937 2018-09-06 01:50:22 Lage2 then magtambay ta ug movie marathon. This Friday pa daw abot ang stocks. If next week ta? Check nako ako sched. Hapon pa ka free ana noh?
2938 2018-09-06 01:50:16 Which only shows that spinners are coming into the game much later than before. How is that an indictment of the spinning stocks?
2939 2018-09-06 01:50:12 I Really appreciate for sharing knowledge & stocks from your own portfolio... thanks for that.
Manas: how & where to learn professional trading like you... as of now am going through the trading related books.

Thanks,

2940 2018-09-06 01:50:09 @nytimes Can we pause for a moment to broadcast that Nike stocks are ALREADY BACK UP?
2941 2018-09-06 01:49:44 Look forward to @MikeFrancesa joining us tomorrow on @HalftimeReport as we talk some stocks and football.
2942 2018-09-06 01:49:43 To try and ensure you don't end up a bum on the street begging, here are some facts genius. Nike stock is up substantially this year and is one of major stocks that is helping Dow Jones produce a 18% return over the past year. Research if you possess the intelligence to do so.
2943 2018-09-06 01:48:39 $MNKD did as expected. Blasted up then faded. Classic shake and bake. Didn’t sell. Still holding. $SPY #stocks #education #stocktrading #swingtrading

2945 2018-09-06 01:48:29 it’s not about how much money nike or kap are making, it’s not about coaches signing and playing kap, it’s about kap sticking to what he believes and nike backing him up on that. stocks and playing time don’t mean shit when you look at the bigger picture.
2946 2018-09-06 01:48:27 Can we pause to make a quick announcement that Nike stocks are ALREADY BACK up. The 2% down for a few hours was being broadcasted around the world as if there was a real damage on those who do not go with the NFL narrative.
2947 2018-09-06 01:48:26 My argument wasn’t with the singular Nike stocks, but the concept of an non diversified portfolio for beginning investors and the cost prohibitiveness of blue chip stocks. Not a singular anecdote
2948 2018-09-06 01:48:05 Nike stocks! Invest! RN!
2949 2018-09-06 01:47:10 I’m glad the general public has finally learned that you make money in stocks by buying low and selling high. Which does nothing for my inability to afford stocks, but, still.

2953 2018-09-06 01:46:57 Seeing all these weed stocks climb on hype is a big joke. Wait till @MissionReadyMRS starts bringing in those billion dollar purchase orders via Unifire. This tweet will age well. @Fmartinezx9 $MRS

2956 2018-09-06 01:45:35 The stocks are down because the whole administration is under investigation, and Bob Woodward dropped some  
2957 2018-09-06 01:45:05 How management communicates mistakes is very important. No one is mistake-free - as investors 40% of the stocks we buy underperform the market - and I'd be concerned about any company where shareholder communication doesn't include a candid assessment of mistakes. -- Bill Nygren

2962 2018-09-06 01:42:45 You’re partially correct. Some money went for that, some to the employees, some in the executives pocket, some reinvested. Bottom line the government didn’t get it to waste it. You cannot deny our corporations are in amazing shape, which is why stocks are high & unemployment low
2963 2018-09-06 01:42:41 Short of whipping out the stocks, I doubt there's anything you can do to implode your channel

2975 2018-09-06 01:38:52 Nike stocks arent a fan.. The man while maybe well intentioned continues to cost companies and lose people large sums of money. I just cant imagine why he isnt employed hey..

2977 2018-09-06 01:38:13 For me personally, the current gov are doing all they can to stabilize rupiah but the foreign force are just too strong, so people's help (buying stocks, etc.) is really significant.

Whereas in Jakarta, they seem to be actively worsening things, so nothing concrete we can do.
2978 2018-09-06 01:38:04 Plz mention the names of stocks which are covered. So we can decide to view the video if we follow those stocks just my view. And thank you Darshan for sharing as always.
2979 2018-09-06 01:36:24 I dumped all stocks with anyone doing business with the NFL long ago and that's who will airing his commercials.  I didn't lose money like those who wait.

2981 2018-09-06 01:34:54 Yes I think the EM concerns have accelerated the sell off in both spot price and stocks. China will still produce close to 2mill EV cars this year though.

2988 2018-09-06 01:28:22 Closed my US positions last night to protect profits - growth stocks across the board saw a decent amount of selling. Will reenter positions quickly if this is just a shallow pullback. Overall still bullish US stocks, but market felt complacent.
2989 2018-09-06 01:27:59 I think Logue’s senior form for Swans, including a 31 possession game in the midfield, boosted his stocks. Only been focussed on footy for a couple of years also.
2990 2018-09-06 01:26:37 So their stocks are on-sale now!?

2997 2018-09-06 01:21:11 Stocks were mostly lower Wednesday, with the Nasdaq Composite dropping more than 1%, as Congress questioned executives from Twitter and Facebook. The dollar fell, and Treasury yields remained largely unchanged.
2998 2018-09-06 01:20:45 @TuckerCarlson Dave Portnoy is an idiot. I thought about Philip Roth’s book, Portnoy’s Complaint, and that about sized up his mentality. He will buy Nike stocks now? As another Tweeter said, Nike should follow through by specializing in knee pads 4 Dave & CK.
2999 2018-09-06 01:20:39 What you’re not saying is the fact that other major stocks like Twitter, Netflix, Facebook, Microsoft are also down, some by as much as 6% within the past day so ...

3009 2018-09-06 01:17:49 Should by Nike stocks
3010 2018-09-06 01:17:47 It’s amazing that despite months of Ju and I encouraging my parents to look into buying stocks that it took the fb status of a friend to inspire my mom to purchase stock Nike.

Honestly, an example of why I put Logic over Reason because son
3011 2018-09-06 01:17:03 I should’ve invested in Nike stocks years ago. Smh
3012 2018-09-06 01:16:47 Property Investors have to be the biggest bunch of whingers. Looking for sympathy the second something is not going their way.

If I took out a margin loan and got burnt buying stocks, those same people would tell me I was greedy and reckless.
3013 2018-09-06 01:16:38 I can’t wait for the stocks to drop on Nike , so I can invest, because it will rise again trust me!

3016 2018-09-06 01:15:03 Markets in Aus have opened down following global markets yesterday. Asian stocks closed lower, and Europe followed. Wall St had a relatively quiet session with the exception to tech stocks, which were marked lower following US Congress questioning @Twitter and @facebook

3026 2018-09-06 01:12:14 With Jordan pulling his Air Jordan line and Kobe pulling away from Nike; their stocks will become very cheap shortly. Thanks to patriots like Jordan and Bryant, these anti American Filthy rich guys will not destroy America.
3027 2018-09-06 01:11:33 Are they laughing about their lower stocks?
3028 2018-09-06 01:11:25 @Boogeyman I bet some of them are in pot stocks now.. especially with tech declining.
3029 2018-09-06 01:11:14 The stocks and the economy have been on a steady increase for a long time now. You're just paying more attention because Trump points it out to you more. Look back in the history of the economy and you'll see it's continued on trend since Obama. Trump policies had little impact.
3030 2018-09-06 01:11:08 Great day but market just got a lot more complicated, some stocks were gutted while others were nicely green.. have raised the most cash in quite some time as well as a totally hedged portfolio. Back to speed dating with the proper setups. Nibbling on $JD and $BABA.

3032 2018-09-06 01:10:41 In a nutshell, Buffett's philosophy is that as companies retain earnings and reinvest in themselves, stocks will intrinsically become more valuable over time.

3036 2018-09-06 01:07:21 Nike marketing scheme by using CK. First: Hope that the hit they initially take in stocks from the loss of business from people who don’t like kaps form of protesting blows over. Next: Hope that minorities and libs can rally up to support the “the cause” and boost stocks greatly.

3040 2018-09-06 01:06:19 It's defamation of character which actually carries a prison sentence in both the UK and America. Also Musk must surely realise this ridiculous outburst could result in his stocks plummeting. The court of public opinion is ruthless. Scandals can make even governments fall

3052 2018-09-06 01:01:09 My paycheck and stocks say otherwise those are facts not fiction your spewing
3053 2018-09-06 01:00:53 BK is now touting Pot Stocks. Oh no.
3054 2018-09-06 01:00:24 Clickbait Barbie is late to the party as stocks bounce back.
3055 2018-09-06 01:00:10 We think the best way to isolate the best value stocks is using a multi factor composite.
3056 2018-09-06 01:00:10 U get how stocks work right Frank?
3057 2018-09-06 00:59:47 Both you and @JackPosobiec got played hard. You both are now laughing stocks of the news world.

3059 2018-09-06 00:59:12 Is it time to buy Nike stocks?
3060 2018-09-06 00:59:05 Good to know! May hit you up for some advice on gas stocks in the future.
3061 2018-09-06 00:58:52 @iLoganVine  would it be smart to look into Nike stocks ?
3062 2018-09-06 00:58:48 Who wouldn’t want a 22 year old Financial Wiz? They would be professional Forkknife players by day and advise me in weed stocks by night, brilliant!
3063 2018-09-06 00:58:21 Question for tomorrow morning: is bitcoin one of the largest U.S. stocks by market capitalization?
3064 2018-09-06 00:58:19 eh, imma go study, you guys have fun with your cyber stocks
3065 2018-09-06 00:57:43 Don’t forget stocks...
3066 2018-09-06 00:57:15 So he wants to make sure the medical industry flourishes? Not the citizens able to flourish with good  Medical Care huh? So that must be where he has his stocks?
3067 2018-09-06 00:56:30 Learn the stocks, play the stocks
3068 2018-09-06 00:55:05 If I were @Nike and the @nfl, @nflcommish, I would cancel the #Kaepernick ad, put it in the dust bin and forget it. Sales and stocks will plummet, viewership and advertising dollars will go to new lows. This is a train wreck waiting to happen. You guys cannot be this stupid!
3069 2018-09-06 00:53:59 The Nike apparel you own give to homeless or cover the swoosh with American Flag  pin!! I’ve ordered my magnet flag to cover my Nike jacket swoosh!! I will never by a Nike product again!! I guess losing Billions of dollars a day as Nike stocks plummet doesn’t matter!!
3070 2018-09-06 00:53:53 Hodlers are dumping to buy $WEED stocks 
3071 2018-09-06 00:53:28 Gopher-Man : Lacklustre Stocks
3072 2018-09-06 00:53:23 Well. As an older couple., old in some eyes, Thinking about dumping stocks and cashing in on whatever we can get. Evil is rampant... We know God will win. But not without great travil.
3073 2018-09-06 00:53:19 What’s the beta average on those great stocks?
3074 2018-09-06 00:53:11 START BUYING NIKE STOCKS !!!!!!
3075 2018-09-06 00:52:21 Could this be explained in a dull way by increased retirement savings being required (people living longer etc.), which generally end up in stocks?
3076 2018-09-06 00:51:59 From a trading standpoint I almost never hold stocks thru earnings - just too risky. Could go either way. I have been in stock for awhile, so its a longer term hold. Price action has held weekly 8ema nicely; but would probably set my stop at 21wma. Cheers.
3077 2018-09-06 00:51:50 Omg once again @TheCWSupergirl is addressing another social issue head on in their own superhero show type way. I live! This time it’s military grade assault rifles and bump stocks and civilian versions being made for “hunting”. @TheCW just keeps impressing me!
3078 2018-09-06 00:50:59 Yeah I'm staying away from EV related stocks at the moment. I've been playing with milk stocks lately and made a nice packet on KTD, just waiting for a decent re-entry
3079 2018-09-06 00:50:58 Also picked up some more $MNB, a rare earth play. Very low market cap, so its a bit of a punt with their drilling assays coming up. Each pip rocks the SP. $AUZ looks nice as a Co play, but would let it settle seeing it just clipped 7c. Plenty of upside for these stocks ATM IMO.
3080 2018-09-06 00:50:51 Thoughts on the recent Nike campaign with Kaepernick? Bought Nike stocks on the disc currently up like 20 bucks but I feel like selling it now cuz trump just tweeted against Nike xD.
3081 2018-09-06 00:49:49 The only problem I have with your time travel ruse is that your first order of business is not to get stupid rich by betting on sports and elections and stocks... but to rename jet skis as ‘boatercycles’ which, feels like the wrong order of operations.
3082 2018-09-06 00:49:45 Weed stocks to open up 20% as the river of dumb money reaches flood stage.
3083 2018-09-06 00:49:33 What effing agenda?  Infrastructure? DACA? Banning bump stocks? Ruining tourism? Putting babies in cages? Worst @POTUS ever!
3084 2018-09-06 00:49:16 Fake news.... you really following CNN?.... so did the stocks of Puma, Adidas, and other shoe companies. This is what happens with stocks. You fell for it
3085 2018-09-06 00:48:33 This was an interesting string. 

You can miss a lot of cheap stocks by using P/B as a main screen tool.

3091 2018-09-06 00:43:57 I wish someone would have taught me about buying and selling stocks
3092 2018-09-06 00:42:52 Let these idiots keep burning Nike and selling their stocks. Swoop in in a week or so, buy that stock low. It'll be back up in a month. Americans have a very short attention span #JustDoIt #ImWithKap
3093 2018-09-06 00:42:11 What if in smash ultimate, you had the time on infinite for a match (infinite stocks as well) and after 3 days worth of Ultimate running, the Moon from Majoras Mask would come down and end the fight whether you would like it to or not, even with items and Hazards off
3094 2018-09-06 00:42:08 Dear everyone that wants to invest. BUY A SHIT TON OF NIKE STOCKS ASAP, this is the best time. Trust me.
3095 2018-09-06 00:41:53 Nike stocks dropping. No problem I'll buy the dip. Need to get rid of your gear then give them to the homeless who can use them. Cause if your burning them then you obviously dont need them.
3096 2018-09-06 00:41:23 "In order to protect our customers from the risks associated with some low-priced stocks, we remove the buy option for stocks like HMNY that consistently trade under $0.10." ------- To get put back on its .50
3097 2018-09-06 00:40:48 Total nonfarm payroll employment rose by 157,000 in July, and the unemployment rate edged down 
to 3.9 percent - People are working

Doing well-even with spending on the war winding down.

Stocks do go up over time, but, they’ve jumped.

Disagree-he stands his ground.
3098 2018-09-06 00:40:22 Hemp Holdings? Pot Positions? Sticky-icky Stocks?
3099 2018-09-06 00:40:18 To everyone who is mad at Nike, Please, hurry up and dump your stocks, already. ijs
3100 2018-09-06 00:40:15 True; he responded back to a tweet with information on how other shoe/athletic apparel stocks were down equal amounts yesterday while Clay just mentioned one for narrative; clay made the big deal out of one day stock price swing which is pointless
3101 2018-09-06 00:39:45 Its weed stocks bitches
3102 2018-09-06 00:39:08 Their stocks dropped 3% yesterday but are still at 28% above what it started the year at and it’s already rebounding. Theyre not going down at all
3103 2018-09-06 00:38:52 The devils lettuce stocks
3104 2018-09-06 00:37:34 Nike stocks rose today ;)
3105 2018-09-06 00:37:07 People who bring up how Nike’s stock dropped 2.4% today know nothing about stocks. Nike, you’re doing great sweetie
3106 2018-09-06 00:36:55 Value Stocks
3107 2018-09-06 00:36:47 Clear sky breakout on all weed stocks. $cron value play
3108 2018-09-06 00:36:32 I think we sell all stocks.
3109 2018-09-06 00:36:00 I checked today and they were up $0.32 at one point, so what the deal with the graph? Stocks change... Instagram’s stock took a dive and rebounded immediately when Kim K talked about leaving the website 
3110 2018-09-06 00:35:59 I really think that these people suffer from TDS soooo bad that they feel compelled to go without food, water and other basic needs in order to blast these tweets and really have no evidence or reasoning behind not being on bored.. GDP up to 4.6%, stocks are at a all time high.
3111 2018-09-06 00:35:59 Real investors don’t typically buy stocks from already established companies unless there’s a short in play. Real investors look for the innovators to boom. Good luck with that buying Nike stock when they haven’t had a high over $100 in a few years.
3112 2018-09-06 00:35:43 Smoke stocks?
3113 2018-09-06 00:35:32 Oh boy. Tanking stocks.
3114 2018-09-06 00:35:32 You don’t understand stocks I can tell
3115 2018-09-06 00:35:27 Every Nike shareholder should dump their Nike stocks
3116 2018-09-06 00:35:10 Small cap stocks
3117 2018-09-06 00:35:08 How is the froth coming out of market if marajuana stocks on rampage? Total speculation. Froth is still there for some

3128 2018-09-06 00:31:25 "27% rise in the price of Concur stocks today in #MarketWatch, as CFO Bad Choicesterson announced: 2019 - the year of the modal"
3129 2018-09-06 00:31:18 You might as well call them Canadian stocks. I'm not even kidding.
3130 2018-09-06 00:31:12 So, if trump doesn’t get re-elected, do we sell social media stocks
3131 2018-09-06 00:31:11 just recently became addicted to buying stocks.... yes I may be broke now but catch me when I’m 75...

3133 2018-09-06 00:30:49 I’m trading Highly Volatile stocks because I like to live dangerously.
3134 2018-09-06 00:30:30 Nike did not drop today bc of the Kapernick campaign All stocks fell today as them and Nike are at all time highs so it's too expensive to buy yet. Don't be stupid.
3135 2018-09-06 00:30:08 we're labeling all Canadian stocks this way?
3136 2018-09-06 00:29:33 Crypto has ruined us all for normal stocks.
3137 2018-09-06 00:29:22 Seems to me like they wanted the stocks to slip so the could buy outstanding shares cheap. Usually always has something to do with money.
3138 2018-09-06 00:28:38 Poll: What are we calling the  stocks? Let’s stick to a single naming convention.
3139 2018-09-06 00:26:49 Multiple tech stocks drop as now begins to be a time to buy! Many expect a drop again but will rise after

You can also buy X% of the total coins of all those you mentioned combined for less than the same X% of Bitcoin.

3147 2018-09-06 00:23:14 I’m telling y’all go get nike stocks right now that shit gonna go back up n a couple weeks
3148 2018-09-06 00:23:00 Just watch. Their stocks are already rebounding.
3149 2018-09-06 00:22:30 It's not invalid. To see if Nike stocks are hurting since the ad campaign, one must also look at the longer trends and not just a daily trend.
3150 2018-09-06 00:22:18 So, sell cross-fit stocks then?

3152 2018-09-06 00:19:56 Yeah, sex is cool, but can we talk about how Smash 4 has 2 stocks while Brawl has 3? Smash 4 is a faster game than Brawl, but includes less stocks in competitive play. In Melee you had 4 stocks for how fast it was and in Brawl for how slow it was.
3153 2018-09-06 00:18:58 My Nike stocks went down by 2 dollars after the Kaep ad and is creeping back up again so I’m good
3154 2018-09-06 00:18:47 I think I'm gonna buy some Nike stocks.
3155 2018-09-06 00:18:33 There you go . When you're mature enough you will understand . Bet your Mommy & Daddy get it. Even if they won't admit it. People checking 401K's, retirement plans stocks & other investments get it. Bottom line chica $$$$$$$
3156 2018-09-06 00:17:33 I’ve had just about enough of these ppl who advocate misguided “self-responsibility” dogma. Stop buying useless knick-knacks? Start a business? Invest in stocks? Use cash instead of credit card? Tell that to the poor who can’t even afford BASIC NECESSITIES. (1/n)
3157 2018-09-06 00:16:56 Can we bring back the stocks that were used for criminals by our forefathers?  Put them in stocks, in front of the Capitol Bldg for ppl to publicly humiliate them.
3158 2018-09-06 00:16:16 Should be easy new ad campaigns...watch those stocks..
3159 2018-09-06 00:15:27 No diference between this and paying cyclicaly adjusted 33X earnings for U.S stocks here at the top of the cycle. Folly is a free spirit.

3168 2018-09-06 00:10:36 Stocks are extremely volatile in the short run. The long term investor cannot afford not to take those risks. #invest #analyze #study #markets
3169 2018-09-06 00:10:36 He has said that if he is not POtuS stocks will crash, we will all be poor, that CNN NBC & other news companies will go out of business bc there will be nothing to report. In other words, he is the only person who matters in the world. THIS IS DIRECT EVIDENCE OF MENTAL ILLNESS.

3171 2018-09-06 00:09:54 how can you cook, dude? my stocks were down to levels not seen since yesterday morning
3172 2018-09-06 00:09:19 Nike has balls.  However they will see a huge hit in sales and stocks.  Sell now! I dont think it will increase sales for those who agree because those kids are saturated with product already.  They will lose a bunch of people who always bought nike now will try different shoes.
3173 2018-09-06 00:08:25 I cite the massive boycott and drop in Nike’s stocks as to why people think his actions are not ok. And when you see the crippled and damaged valiant veterans who struggle from their wheelchairs to rise and honor the playing of the National anthem, then everyone should. Everyone.
3174 2018-09-06 00:07:37 That’s a myth, they use the xtra money to buy stocks and line CEO’s pockets.
3175 2018-09-06 00:06:33 I wish I could help with the stocks. :/ Maybe take a break from that and do freewriting?
3176 2018-09-06 00:06:33 And he still sucks as stocks go down :)
3177 2018-09-06 00:05:46 Several athletic shoe company stocks were down because of the uncertainty concerning NAFTA and tariffs, but don’t let facts get in the way of your opinions.
3178 2018-09-06 00:04:53 Stocks as well as precious metals & gems and investment properties.
3179 2018-09-06 00:03:59 Nike’s stock isn’t going to fall that bad if any. They are soliciting to those that are on the fence or agree with Kap. That’s the market & it’s enough to stay even. Then rich America will buy & sell the stocks. It’s that simple.
3180 2018-09-06 00:03:20 Gonna be a lot of their stocks sold, nike's not for America, good to see 'em go.
3181 2018-09-06 00:03:02  but so many African Americans said they’d buy their stocks 
3182 2018-09-06 00:00:16 Stocks for Nike are literally less than 100 , it’s really time to invest
