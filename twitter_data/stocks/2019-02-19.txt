5 2019-02-19 23:56:24 @Tzeporah She has no life other than her evangelical dream that her activism will change the world.   It might, but not for the better.  Wacko's cannot be the factors that determine policy.  CO2 emissions are a minor element of climate change vilified by activists with US stocks.
6 2019-02-19 23:56:04 I think if u announce a stock as a “new” stock and comment that  u bring it up because people want “new” stocks, u are bringing in a bias and negating the true wisdom of the crowd. It is pretty clear people are taking sides and no one wants to be against u in the class.

11 2019-02-19 23:50:54 $LPD solid uptake. Pros involved, will test old resistance, needs to break through to continue its steady incline. LT hold imo. #asx #stocks #trading
12 2019-02-19 23:50:50 $APYP $MLHC $LIBE $BGFT $MLHC all are good stocks with great volume. Although toxic findings and debt have led to a continuous cycle of practices that destroy shareholder value. $DNAD showing transparency with 4b OS restricted. $COBI released filings to go current few days ago
13 2019-02-19 23:49:48 Absolutely correct Eric. I cant imagine why companies like Baytex and Athabasca are not thinking along those lines. Build value per share and have a positive indirect effect of reducing storage inventory. As a shareholder of oil stocks I dont care about production growth anymore.
14 2019-02-19 23:48:17 Think About It 

*How "Low" do you think they can take "Certain" stocks in price like Lower share structure ones & Low floaters before there's a trade to be made ? 

*The Lower the price, the More Eyes it gets, the Better the entries, the Higher the Percentage gains if it moves.
15 2019-02-19 23:47:25 Damn 2 stocks was ass lol
16 2019-02-19 23:46:47 Only penny stock I would be buying right now is $COBI which has Cannabis Real Estate News with name change coming up. And $DNAD which is pending post CE removal. $LIBE $MLHC and $APYP are riddled with severe dilution. Load quality stocks $COBI and $DNAD
