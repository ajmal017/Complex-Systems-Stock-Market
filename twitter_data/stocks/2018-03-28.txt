13 2018-03-28 23:54:11 Most people do support the 2nd amendment, as I do, I believe in certain things, no bump stocks, age limit of 21 on certain gun types,  background checks that are more detailed to check for any mental illness, true gun owners don't like crazies either!

40 2018-03-28 23:50:35 I’ve been on a little hiatus lately due to some changes in life and work. Have had to focus solely on work as of late. I’ll get back to posting stocks/picks and sharing good ideas soon!
41 2018-03-28 23:50:04 Hmm, I want to believe this but you can be saying this to protect your stocks...
42 2018-03-28 23:49:17 Already got a rigid morning routine that I run like clockwork to help me function. Lisdexamfetamine will live right by my contact lenses! If I can find a bloody pharmacy that stocks it....
43 2018-03-28 23:49:13 My point is why say it?? Especially on national TV. Why not say how K has gotten this kid and that kid but is hurting their stocks by making them play Zone?? Or how much more money the UK kids make in the NBA??  We will see how many he gets now that Duffel bag Capel is gone.
44 2018-03-28 23:48:57 not if you know how to short stocks.  No different than what the investment community is doing in crypto by shorting the Cboe and CME bitcoin futures. Very good opportunities exist for those that know how to trade and how the right tools
45 2018-03-28 23:48:54 Probably not if that liberal police chief actually let his officers enter the building. And that Las Vegas shooter had bum stocks I’m pretty sure but I could be wrong
46 2018-03-28 23:48:41 Nobody wants anybody to give up their guns.That's not even the issue. We want something different. Background checks for crazy, gun stocks abolished, no war gun, & end the NRA influential access over the GOP.. nra needs the IRS to look at there tax returns they claim non-profit.
47 2018-03-28 23:47:43 $430k???? Bro that’s shy of half a mill. He got too greedy. After 80-100k I would of invested that money in stocks and businesses and just quit after that
48 2018-03-28 23:47:26 The only way to switch a semi automatic weapon is to use a bump stock. And in all the school shootings that have occurred no bump stocks were ever used.
49 2018-03-28 23:47:09 Gotta stick to Reddit! When #maga leaves twitter stocks will tumble
50 2018-03-28 23:46:55 The horn was in response to the article which pointed to this being done on their end to identify these stocks and yes I agree ,nothing wrong with promotion as long as its 100% factual
51 2018-03-28 23:46:40  Stocks can make you diamond rocks
52 2018-03-28 23:46:14 Yes, yes, no, no. I don’t think he could have done as much damage without the bump stock. One question for you. What is the point of bump stocks being legal? Especially when machine guns are illegal?
53 2018-03-28 23:45:59 That's the scary part. We need to arm teachers, and hire veterans for guards. We need to regulate bump stocks and other useless weapon mods
54 2018-03-28 23:45:35 Probably Stocks to trade
55 2018-03-28 23:45:34 Stocks to Watch: AAPL, AAPL, BSX. Read our in-depth analysis for more.
56 2018-03-28 23:45:25 $DUK and $IRM.  These 2 stocks should be avoided at all cost.  The same range since last year.  They both cost me a lot of $$$ Though I made my loss back.  Reason for only $SPY since then.
57 2018-03-28 23:45:06 you should focus on stocks  consistently  !
58 2018-03-28 23:44:15 I be reading all type of articles on yahoo finance now. I see how a lot of shit correlate to others too now that I got into the stocks.
59 2018-03-28 23:44:04 We are not trying to repeal the 2nd amendment, we want universal background checks, we want bump stocks outlawed, we want AR15s off the market, we want common-sense gun control and existing laws enforced.  I will never again vote for anyone that takes NRA money.
60 2018-03-28 23:43:38 Bump stocks or altering firearms - yes. Age - no.  Fix mental health and current laws that are ignored or current reports that are not followed up on and leave law abiding citizens alone.
61 2018-03-28 23:42:39 Limit clip size and outlaw bump stocks.
62 2018-03-28 23:42:18 Trump revived the stocks from the bear market, trump has kept the unemployment rate lower than all of obamas 8 years for 3 straight months, most likely 4 soon. Job growth getting better even with a tighter employment availibility, wages are finally going up, but not enough
63 2018-03-28 23:41:09 Start with the boring.  Low cost ETFs that track the broad market should your base level of investing. Look at vanguard funds. Think about an ETF as buying a basket of stocks. Low risk over a multi-yr horizon.  Yes there are 2008-2009 but the US broad market has always come back
64 2018-03-28 23:40:15 Penner not in favor of banning bump stocks for guns but wants to increase ability to obtain them.
65 2018-03-28 23:40:14 Market expecting record bean stocks and near 1mln acre increase in acres. Big report tomorrow. Option premium remains low for those looking to protect bushels.

68 2018-03-28 23:39:13 They said the same thing about penny stocks, which also had the net effect of defrauding retail investors.

You're history. Repeating.
69 2018-03-28 23:39:02 Penner: Criminals will still get guns, if teachers want guns that is a local school board position. Increase regulations significantly on bump stocks and like
70 2018-03-28 23:38:51 But as a South Carolinian you embarrass all of us with this moronic tweet- we just want cops protected- no bump stocks or high capacity mags/ real background checks - and no guns for mentally ill
71 2018-03-28 23:38:33 Right Up Netflix and Chill, I’m sure there Stocks will represent the hire!
72 2018-03-28 23:38:20 First question: Should Congress enact more gun control legislation? Do you support ban on bump stocks? Raise age limit on purchases?
73 2018-03-28 23:38:00 Charlie, The NRA sued the State of Florida the SAME DAY Gov. Scott signed a law banning bump stocks & raising the age of gun ownership from 18 to 21 in response to #MSD, so there’s that.

Ma…
76 2018-03-28 23:33:57 @LindseyGrahamSC you know not every Democrat wants the 2nd A repealed.  They are asking for sensible gun law reforms, such as ban on bump stocks, military style rapid fire rifles, ammo mags that hold over x bullets, universal background checks, no fly no gun, etc. Get real
77 2018-03-28 23:33:54 Nonsense. We've got their attention. It's an ambit claim, but it needs to be on the table. If you start your negotiation saying "sorry, bump stocks and a few military rifle styles bother us" you end up where we are now: shitsville. Or dead.

Fuck em! #Repeal #Replace #2Amendment
78 2018-03-28 23:33:15 Lindsey, I think most Dems don't want a complete repeal, they want common sense controls - ban bump stocks, magazine size limits, 21 age limit, etc.  Makes sense, no?
79 2018-03-28 23:32:56 Oh c’mon MooseMan. Get with the program! The cod stocks off the Atlantic have tanked due to the seals eating them. That justifies killing seals with hacapics(so?). At least that’s what my Cabinet Minister father in law told me. No??? You mean he lied to me??? For shame Joel M!!!
80 2018-03-28 23:32:25 Chinese emptied out the last 11MMbl of Saldanha Bay in Nov-Dec. Now there are no more one time floating stocks available anywhere. US on land likely the last of the surplus around 70MMbl. Lets see how many ships fail to discharge fully and head to China.
81 2018-03-28 23:31:30 $SPY Bear market? Not yet but I suppose it could feel that way, depending on what stocks you're holding and buy point. Why I stress stops.
82 2018-03-28 23:30:24 Lol so now we are talking about mandatory state enforced buybacks? What happened to bump stocks? What happens when I don't give them my gun? Can they shoot me or do I just go to the gulag?
83 2018-03-28 23:27:36 A $500 loan saved my college career and this dude at Howard stealing almost $429K to floss.  At least invest in stocks, Bitcoin, or something. Damn.
84 2018-03-28 23:26:29 European stocks were mixed on Wednesday as gains for healthcare shares helped offset losses in the technology sector.
85 2018-03-28 23:26:23 Stocks available now? We tried to get one last month but none available.
86 2018-03-28 23:26:22 Elsewhere, energy stocks turned to erase some recent gains as Occidental Petroleum lost 4.1%, Chevron declined 2.2%, Schlumberger slid 2.0% and @Halliburton eased 1.8%.
87 2018-03-28 23:26:19 Coke stocks drop.
88 2018-03-28 23:26:06 You should have not budged a single bit! Bump stocks ARE NOT making a firearm AUTOMATIC - still semi auto - 1 trigger pull per cartridge. Full Auto = 1 trigger pull - multiple cartridges fired till finger released!

93 2018-03-28 23:24:34 US stocks fell on Wednesday, with equity benchmarks switching between gains and losses as the market struggled to move higher following Tuesday’s technology-driven rout.
94 2018-03-28 23:24:31 Agree. One mentioned what she'd heard about fish, which wasn't that quotas boost stocks. Did anyone say that migrants made us £billions?

100 2018-03-28 23:22:20 You need to pay attention to market conditions. If the market becomes filled with sellers during times like these. It is often better to just hold cash and watch to see what happens. You cannot sell for a profit if no one is buying.

105 2018-03-28 23:18:56 Banning bump stocks could get passed, National stricter backgrounds could get past but then you have thousands of marchers calling for banning guns. That is counter productive especially when they are ignorant about guns.

110 2018-03-28 23:14:09 I told my bestfriend give me a year and watch how much our stocks go up 
111 2018-03-28 23:13:55 Banning Semi Auto Weapons is basically a gun ban (won’t happen). Banning bump stocks (in ok with that). Gun databases? Nope. Expand Background Checks? Sure. Expand mental health? Yeah as long a Due Process is maintained. Private gun sales? Sure. Will be hard to police. /1
112 2018-03-28 23:13:51 You’re in an echo chamber Alison. Try listening to folk in the fishing industry not EU civil servants. Other countries fish our stocks & sell them to us while our dwindling fleet are limited by Brussels. The EU paid UK fishermen to burn their boats & retire.
113 2018-03-28 23:13:50 wall street scamming yet again today, trashing stocks for no reason whatsoever, they need to be in jail
114 2018-03-28 23:13:33 I agree, for example I support the banning of bump stocks as there is no need for those devices in America, which is what was used in Vegas.
Thanks again Justin, Hope we run across each other again. Take Care!
115 2018-03-28 23:12:55 @SIRIUSXM all I see is negative posts about #diplosrevolution and @sxmElectro. I would be pretty upset as a shareholder if I see revenue flying out the window. Hmm stocks is down last couple days...js...

127 2018-03-28 23:02:18 Rough couple months for the market.  Lots of selling pressure throughout the MJ sector. 
My prediction is that small weed company’s will start to get bought up this summer.  
If you’re holding weed stocks, I wouldn’t suggest selling right now.  Wait out this storm!

129 2018-03-28 23:01:37 I dont need bump stocks Mr. Freeman
130 2018-03-28 23:01:22 Why did president Obama legalize bump stocks????????? Why did president Obama pardon 600 drug dealers??????????
131 2018-03-28 22:59:44 "Foolish comparison". Not really. Crypto went up a lot more than stocks did. It's all relative. That's why the 200 day MA matters.
132 2018-03-28 22:57:35 As long as you will vote within "American Illusion of Democracy", you will have to wait & wait & these corrupt leaders will never do right by their own people, instead for the corrupt corporations to their kickbacks & shares in the stocks.
133 2018-03-28 22:56:45 Obama tried to enact common sense gun laws by approving Bump-Stocks for sale.
134 2018-03-28 22:56:40 Should have put some of that money in stocks or Bitcoin before it peaked. He would have been a millionaire.
135 2018-03-28 22:55:09 Universal background checks.

Liability insurance.

No bump stocks.

First time buyer takes a class with written exam & aptitude test at the range.

Private sales must be officiated by a licensed dealer.

Domestic violence ban.

None of these things will harm law abiding citizens
136 2018-03-28 22:55:00 Honestly, I hate his supporters so much that I want them to suffer
Maybe then they will understand what a liar and threat to America he really is. So repeal ACA, increase taxes, let stocks fall 
take away their social security
Let us all suffer. 
I'm at a point where I dont care
137 2018-03-28 22:54:33 Don't think so! The unemployment rate is now the lowest in 12 yrs. Black unemployment is the lowest in history. Stocks soaring!
138 2018-03-28 22:54:03 I woke up when the stock market closed smh  lol got some good low close out tech stocks though. Hopefully I can get at least %10 profit on em tomorrow.
139 2018-03-28 22:53:25 Hahaha last year you didn't like any of the weed stocks Gass... Did you try some?
140 2018-03-28 22:53:25 I know someone who only invests in madcap stocks
141 2018-03-28 22:53:07 No. The machine gun was banned for very similar reasons and we've had over 70 years of fewer problems, and not many would disagree with Joe Public not having access to automatic weapons, or bump stocks.
142 2018-03-28 22:52:35 I love that I’m getting more familiar with stocks and how investments work, can’t wait to really secureeee the baggggg 
143 2018-03-28 22:52:18 This includes bump stocks Mr. President.  Please start to roll back the NFA, hughes amendment, and all other illegal regulations on our 2nd amendment rights.
144 2018-03-28 22:50:12 Fine: Short answer, yes. Bump stocks, waiting period, etc., would not have prevented Parkland. Mental health services, however, I continue to support #321schoolsafety #parkland #parklandshooting #parklandschoolshooting
145 2018-03-28 22:49:36 I got dividends twice this week..please invest your money y’all. Do not be intimated by stocks
146 2018-03-28 22:48:58 This is so accurate. Also: 

Salon: Stocks drop, indicating Russian collusion with [trigger warning] Trump.
147 2018-03-28 22:48:21 Is it legal for buffoon Trump to manipulate stocks? Has anyone checked to see if he or GS is shorting these stocks?
148 2018-03-28 22:48:02 Obama Administration legalized bump stocks. BAD IDEA. As I will take this happen, and despite the $700 &amp; $716 Billion Dollars gotten to find a great help. He is looking really good. It has perhaps never been many years, have been better.
149 2018-03-28 22:48:02 Agree absolutely on bank stocks, but I would probably wait a while before buying them. Neg press from RC will push them lower until ppl realise RC evidence is mostly BS
150 2018-03-28 22:47:56 Cash keeps making it's way into $USD and bonds and out of stocks.. $Crypto i have come to see as risk factor play, ie when markets feel bullish crypto goes up.. well that not happening.
These 3 things are in my mind point to a set up for a near term correction in US markets
151 2018-03-28 22:46:21 FANGMAN stocks are blowing apart a bit. Minor cause for concern considering how hard they moved, unsurprising. But if they were the major “leaders”

155 2018-03-28 22:45:42 Have u read the new gun law bill?  Do u know what bump stocks r and how they effect purchase of guns? What r the leading causes of adolescent deaths from 1-5? Do u know specifics about the higher end guns and what is considered automatic?
156 2018-03-28 22:45:06 Pete, ever bullish, was reserved in his own way. Sitting on cash and energy stocks (woof); loved MSFT. He always loves that name!
157 2018-03-28 22:44:56 Oz term deposits for 5 years yield about 2.5%. Government bonds about 2.8% for $350K. I can’t see why people would think these places are a good investment, long term, short term or any term.....I’d even buy banks stocks at current high prices over these places.  Oligopoly wins.
158 2018-03-28 22:43:25 $NVCN this stocks reminds me of DCTH
159 2018-03-28 22:42:37 I like how you left out almost all streaming sites are down. Amazon down 6%, Apple 2%, google is down and of course Facebook.  

They are not down due to any one hiring. They are down like all stocks.

161 2018-03-28 22:40:40 thanks, glad you liked the site! My sense, reading a lot from both sides, is that registration of existing bump stocks is an option, but just as a political reality, repealing the Hughes Amendment is not plausible right now. Want to keep the deal focused and achievable.
162 2018-03-28 22:39:03 Meron pero limited stocks
163 2018-03-28 22:38:05 Okay, fine, so do we have to say everything? You know what I mean. Semi-automatic, bump stocks, anything designed to rip into large numbers of humans in a short time. That’s what I mean! Not just bullets for hunting prey.
164 2018-03-28 22:36:53 The problem is most acknowledge stocks are overvalued but they were hoping to ride it out a while longer thinking they were smart enough to get out before it crashed. That’s why people are so sensitive to this action over last two months.
165 2018-03-28 22:35:40 It's called the Overton window and that's exactly what they're trying to push. Swing so hard one way that the little pansies give up something (like the AR-15 or bump stocks) and slowly but surely they'll take everything else.
166 2018-03-28 22:33:54 No need to show you my need.
1 incident w/ bump stocks = BANNED!!!!!!
1 death from cigarettes & alcohol = BANNED!!!!
etc...
limit ammo = do some research on youtube...

The nuts pulling off ill-defined "mass shootings" are NUTS and do much less harm than cigarettes & alcohol.

177 2018-03-28 22:30:42 Wow, nice work on the overseas stats. Confirms my disagreement with every mock draft I’ve seen w/ @Amber_Stocks picking DDD #3 or #4 for @wnbachicagosky. 1st Round yes around #10. Plus she’s a suspected head case; inconsistent effort & has trouble getting along w/ teammates.
178 2018-03-28 22:30:25 I think it was Good Friday 1994 when stocks were closed and bonds were open and Bonds were down the limit. 
Do any of my bond folks remember that? @Fullcarry @IvanTheK @InterestArb ?

183 2018-03-28 22:25:27 I'd be interested to know how much #Netflix stocks have dropped this next week over this announcement. Many are cancelling subscriptions over this.
184 2018-03-28 22:24:04 Has anyone wondered when #Trump talks shit about a company and it's stocks go down, maybe his companies are gobbling up the cheap stocks?

186 2018-03-28 22:21:44 I'm trying to top off my kids' college tuition accounts.  Stocks and bonds in their 529 only go so far.  Thanks for your prompt because I think this message is important so ppl can focus on the WHY they're HODLing.
187 2018-03-28 22:21:23 The value creation of an asset is so vital for its existence. Bitcoin is not backed by a value it's backed by a hyped trend.  Private Equities ,Bond s ,and stocks on the other hand have a creation value that you can see and evaluate it.
188 2018-03-28 22:20:53 Everyone who looks at their portfolio today realizes how much mutual funds and index funds are just different mixes of the same tech heavyweights.  Unless you actually picked stocks  or your fund managers do their jobs
189 2018-03-28 22:20:28 @realDonaldTrump Ok Mr. President the trade deals, stocks, tax relief ALL great! I want to know when you're going to go after & repeal ObamaCare? If you get that accomplished you will lock up the elections for the GOP! Obama knew that these premiums would hurt Americans. FIX IT
190 2018-03-28 22:20:15 A while back I was deciding on a stock to invest in, I narrowed it down to 2 stocks, the one I chose has gone up 65% but the one I didn't choose has gone up 262% 
191 2018-03-28 22:19:33 Uhm... usually the less moves the better. Both are nice companies. i don't sell often (except this month! ha ha) but $EMP.A had a low dividend and I wanted to take advantage of beat-up stocks. Don't have a lot of Telecom. $VZ and $BCE but it's very low % wise in my portfolio.
192 2018-03-28 22:19:01 My stocks are flying through the God damn roof, son.
193 2018-03-28 22:18:33 Unified community? How could I ever be unified with those who have said they have the right to gun me down for 1) asking for bump stocks to be banned, 2) supporting the LGBTQ community, 3) believing there are dangerous influences on our president from Russia & they are dangerous?

196 2018-03-28 22:16:23 Go back and watch those videos again and listen to the shooting. Guess what he used ... 19 fire arms and he had thousands of ammunition. He had semi automatic to automatic guns. He also used bump stocks with those guns. Now, figure it out.

200 2018-03-28 22:14:53 I am not pleased with his pro gun performance. The only idea he shot down in the televised meeting was the Reciprocity Bill. He instructed the DOJ to make a new rule on Bump stocks. and he did not veto the spending bill with the NICS added into it. He did not stand up for the 2nd
201 2018-03-28 22:14:36 Well my stocks in McDonald's are doing well at the moment so im going to be ordering a bunch of comics soon. I will add it to the list.
202 2018-03-28 22:14:18 I can tell you as a novice, knowing so many stocks are “overvalued” it can be scary and hard to know if you are looking at the ‘day of reckoning’ that so many discuss (very convincingly I might add). Why, why why did XYZ fall?  The 150PE? Tariffs?
203 2018-03-28 22:14:16 Hey @jimcramer @MadMoneyOnCNBC I don't want to forget about #FAANG and go buy $CLX. I want you to tell me WHEN to sell them. Remember it's too late after stocks are down 40% ! Didn't you say before capital preservation is part of what you do for your viewers??

214 2018-03-28 22:08:06 I saw that on the news today and thought of what your tweet the other day about said about certain stocks correcting. Then the news on Facebook then the news today...didn’t fall for it buddy...thanks to you!

235 2018-03-28 22:00:32 As for a ban on bump stocks, that's definitely another idea that I consider to be very logical, and am 100% behind as well. Those sorts of things make sense imo.
236 2018-03-28 22:00:24 Also @amy4thepeople supports a ban on bump stocks, other accelerant devices, and high powered magazines that turn semi-automatics into fully automatic weapons
237 2018-03-28 22:00:01 The bankruptcy of Remington and the falling stocks of Smith & Wesson, and the 200 jobs gotten rid of are all part of a trend..a trend where they made lots of guns projecting that "they're gonna take your guns" and when that didn't happen they're fucked financially. It's happening

254 2018-03-28 21:52:29 Mandatory licensing and safety course, like a car, no high velocity rifles, high capacity magazines,armor piercing rounds, hollow point rounds,hellfire triggers,bump stocks. register all guns owned,21+handguns,<21 bolt action rifles only
255 2018-03-28 21:51:51 investment journalist who promoted certain stocks that are shall we say...questionable?
256 2018-03-28 21:51:01 You could buy some D-wave. If Quantum PCs ever do anything of value, that's the company to hold stock in. Tesla is another safe pick. When Boring is done, pull out, same with their first trip to Mars. Their stocks will plunge and it'll affect Tesla.
257 2018-03-28 21:50:24 Grasso now looking for a big whoosh to the downside and has sold his stocks.

260 2018-03-28 21:46:52 @kareems I read your site and I do agree with the proposals, but I have one tweak.

As you said, post-'86 MGs are not available to civilians, bump stocks were born from that ban.

Solution: Classify bump stocks as MGs and reopen the MG registry for civilians.
261 2018-03-28 21:46:38 They already do background checks and mental health checks... But if ur 18 u can go to war still? N yea buno stocks r stupid I agree. Bit that's a out the onky thing .they already have a comprehensively difficult process to obtain a legal firearm.its criminakswehave to worryabout
262 2018-03-28 21:46:18 The 148.5 point (+2.2%) rally seen in FTSE Futures so far this week marks the strongest start to a week in the 68 weeks since 7 December 2016. Wednesday's 87.5 point (+1.3%) gain was the biggest rally seen on a Wednesday in the 56 weeks since 1 March 2017 #stocks
263 2018-03-28 21:45:32 One could even make the argument that since the ATF legalized bump stocks under Obama (and he didn’t criminalize them) and Trump is talking about banning them, maybe Obama worked out more in the NRA’s favor...?

269 2018-03-28 21:43:34 Thank you for saying that. But banning Bump-stocks, next will be semi-autos. Sir, we cannot fight tyranny with just revolvers.
270 2018-03-28 21:43:32 How did you come with those analysis/predictions? 10T by 2020???? That’s more than the market cap of the penny stocks and what’s Gold market cap!!!
271 2018-03-28 21:43:19 A Great Day At @IBDinvestors: Today, in celebration of Founders Day, IBD staff and sister firm employees enjoyed tri-tip, pork, chicken BBQ outdoors together with IBD Chair Bill O'Neil, who was smiling, chatting w/ all. He changed the way many of us see #stocks forever #trading
272 2018-03-28 21:42:47 People have no idea that it was Obama that approved the sale of bump stocks in the United States.
273 2018-03-28 21:42:39 Respectfully, it is MY understanding is dwindling #salmon stocks are why the #Orcas are starving and more frequently going after more far difficult prey - Grey whale calves.  #ocean #environment #overfishing
274 2018-03-28 21:42:07 Regardless of who pays for it, the debt is still climbing, bump stocks are still legal, and healthcare is still crazy expensive, and this wall won’t be cheap. I’m still not seeing how Trump > Obama. Especially since Obama never came close to taking guns, and it’s closer than ever
275 2018-03-28 21:40:57 @TheFive Jesse, putting the 2nd Amendment to a vote would be a mistake. There's NO chance the 2nd is repealed; the danger is that it will be chipped away at (bump stocks, high-capacity mags, AR-15s, etc.).  Putting it to a vote gives Dems the chance to lie about their intentions.
276 2018-03-28 21:40:01 My dad is blasting DMX and TI since my mom got home, she’s pissed, I’m Ctfu, and he’s relaxed af doing his stocks 
277 2018-03-28 21:39:31 Im in all cash, since last week - locked and loaded and ready to get back into 70% tech stocks - this selloff was needed!
278 2018-03-28 21:39:11 Its not that stocks are responding market conditions. It's the market responding to an uninformed erratic narcissist Donald Trump. With more than 2,000 lies his first 12 months in office I just don't understand this irrational exuberance with his known lack of integrity.
279 2018-03-28 21:38:02 Just canceled it. I hope their stocks sinks like the Titanic

282 2018-03-28 21:37:21 Cancelled Netflix!  Sold Stocks!
283 2018-03-28 21:36:47 On a simple technical basis it's an asc triangle. US frackers are seeing tapering of previous well production, and Bolton is . Oil stocks are cheap but I agree they could stay that way.

295 2018-03-28 21:33:06 Don’t forget to talk about dropping STOCKS AGAIN
296 2018-03-28 21:33:04 323 #SPX stocks negative year to date - has to be a few bargains in there.  63 with a PEG of one or better.  #homework time
297 2018-03-28 21:33:04 And …

• Limit magazine sizes.
• Quit making weapons than can easily be modified.
• Ban silencers, bump stocks, cranks, etc.
• Take guns away from anyone who threatens violence of any kind (but with due process).

I'll stop there. Got shit to do besides state the obvious.
298 2018-03-28 21:32:18 Whole lot of Hoopla about #BumpStocks and @realDonaldTrump has already addressed this BUT did you know Bump Stocks were created for #disabledveterans ? 
Seriously they were.

305 2018-03-28 21:29:09 What an absolute pleasure knowing you, Brian Stocks. From football, golf, to the wine tasting in Germany. Rest in peace mate. 
306 2018-03-28 21:29:02 So the FANG stocks are under pressure. Look at the PE’s.......except for Apple there’s no room for doubt.

309 2018-03-28 21:26:17 They want to do away with all private gun ownership, the assault weapon and bump stocks are just starting lines for fascism.

316 2018-03-28 21:22:43 a long overdue correction. i sold out most of my holdings last monday to lock in high tech profits since jan 2016 and i'm new to bios since last december and sold most of them too. i'll be waiting for low prices on the same stocks.

319 2018-03-28 21:18:39 All this noise of how tech #stocks are rolling over and losing their mojo. Really, they should reset but to think they’re out of favor, absurd. We live in a tech driven world and that isn’t going to change.
320 2018-03-28 21:17:17 Parker’s Target is 3,150 with 20% upside but excludes technology and financials. I agree with value stocks leading but this target won’t happen without both of those sectors participating.
321 2018-03-28 21:17:06 Start-ups sure. But FANG stocks have been ... albeit Amazon just reinvest profits and run a long horizon model. I'd not looked at Tesla closely until this week ... What a shocker!!!
322 2018-03-28 21:16:54 Now you see how I feel. If they ban bump stocks, who cares. If they ban 30 rd mags, won't care. If they ban firearms then I care.
323 2018-03-28 21:16:27 I didn’t start with any VGK playeds in my leagues. After awhile i took up stocks in Morton salt and got my psych. Degree for all the damage Vegas has done.
324 2018-03-28 21:16:24 $Crypto is complex. Lately tech stocks drive $BTC drives $Alts. So $FB and Zuck have more impact on $NANO $TRX $ICX $BNB than fundamental project performance. Welcome to crypto, where everything is connected in a matrix of FUD and hedge bots.
325 2018-03-28 21:14:55 @jimcramer what do you say about FANG and NVDA when looking at P/E at 2x growth as books and statements said. Also noted all AI depends on access to Data...all stocks touching it getting hit. Thoughts?
326 2018-03-28 21:14:49 1. I assume you mean bump stocks. Already going off the market and will be against the law.
327 2018-03-28 21:13:49 Notice the deleveraging domino effect over the last 6 months. First it was #bitcoin topping out (highest risk asset), now stocks. Massive global deleveraging going on. Bounces will come but its far from over.
328 2018-03-28 21:13:12 Few other things, humans are ingenious. Bump stocks are hell on a gun. Tear them up easily. Banning them will generally keep the uninformed criminals from having them as they don't extensively research. Belt loops, rubber balls, Springs can do same thing.
329 2018-03-28 21:12:51 DOJ just banned bump stocks (not that it will change anything).  Florida just upped the age to 21 to purchase guns (and that won't do anything either and is likely unconstitutional).
330 2018-03-28 21:12:29 @stocks_william
331 2018-03-28 21:12:28 Eh - but not tech startups! And many of the big tech stocks are barely profitable, esp. relative to their ridiculous share prices.
332 2018-03-28 21:12:19 @stocks_william
333 2018-03-28 21:11:54 Good Lord, you need to do your research on bump stocks. Here, let me help on the concert. No guns would’ve helped you. The shooter wasn’t even there. He was across the street in a hotel on the 32nd floor. Nobody knew where the shooting was coming from until it was too late.
334 2018-03-28 21:11:50 My finance professor went from talking about stocks to how much he loves Simon Cowell
335 2018-03-28 21:10:34 What do you expect when their most respected analyst is Cramer? Buy mall stocks and forget energy! I'm sure there is more drivel about to be screached on toninghts show. With plenty of buttons, weird sounds and pictures of bears. And Jim standing with an apple on his head.

340 2018-03-28 21:08:58 And the Vegas shooter had way more than that in addition to bump stocks. Did you have a GOOD point to make?

342 2018-03-28 21:07:46 Not averse to initiating positions once price action and breadth begin to improve. Oil looks far more constructive than the energy stocks. Perhaps surprising, but when something isn’t behaving the way it should given what we know, it’s possible we are the ones missing something.
343 2018-03-28 21:07:38 FANG stocks 

this about this name.
344 2018-03-28 21:07:01 To address the bump stocks; i see it as a moot point. One can mimic the fire rate of a fully-automatic without one given the right technique.

That said, im perfectly okay with them being very heavily regulated like fully automatic weapons to maintain consistency.
345 2018-03-28 21:06:49 What stocks are you trading ?
346 2018-03-28 21:06:45 The Sean Penn novel is to the first amendment what bump stocks are to the second
347 2018-03-28 21:06:34 Again you are a LIAR.  There is no push to do away with the 2nd amendment.  You are just feeding into the fears of your moronic base.  There needs to be sensible gun laws in place and that includes doing away with citizens owning any military type rifle AND the damn bummp stocks
348 2018-03-28 21:06:21 Not looking at the value pf my portfolio as it wont be good. my efforts on finding what I hope are quality stocks at reasonable valuations. Bought a few Taptica today. I think its a good quality company and forward PER is certainly not high.
349 2018-03-28 21:05:41 And to say “most illegals end up in prison” is a nonsensical argument. As is Obama having the option to ban bump stocks. They never came to the forefront of the gun debate during his tenure. Nobody has outlawed Geissle triggers, either.
350 2018-03-28 21:05:06 @POTUS Trump owes Amazon the money his comments this morning lost this company $.
@SpeakerRyan  Congress needs to ban Potus tweeting when he tanks stocks like he did Amzn today. Un-Presidential & unacceptable. Blue wave coming in Nov. Trmp has to go! No potus talks @ stock market

373 2018-03-28 21:02:06 You realise stock values are meaningless in a timeframe as little as five days. Stocks should be considered over years. :P

378 2018-03-28 21:01:21 There are limits to most rights, EXCEPT 2A. That needs to change. Sensible prohibitions like banning bump stocks, high capacity mags and renewal of the assault weapons ban are all common sense measures that don't infringe on any person's right to keep and bear arms.

383 2018-03-28 21:00:21 "His generation can't start a lawnmower" but in a few months he'll be old enough* to own an AR15  (or bump stocks or armor peircing bullets, etc) --with no training required.

So, he's too young to start a revolution, but not too young* to own military-style weapons.

Got it.

388 2018-03-28 20:58:23 I didnt say anything about bump stocks, nor did i say having a gun on me would've 100% saved me.

I did say an AR-15 is no more or less deadly than most other rifles or handgus. And that having my gun in that scenario would at least give me a chance.

396 2018-03-28 20:56:08 Absolutely respect your post Jim. That’s always been my go to question for guys who shell out thousands of dollars for guns– “Can you hunt with them”. “No”, they reply “it’s illegal”. 

AR15s, large capacity magazines, and bump stocks  are useless, dangerous, a big waste of money

What is your opinion on housing?
404 2018-03-28 20:54:00 So, are trying to tell me bump stocks do nothing to an AR-15? Again, would your gun have saved you from that shooting in Vegas?
405 2018-03-28 20:53:49 You sound like an over-enthusiastic Libertarian rn and it kinda grosses me out. Why even include bump stocks in the conversation if your main point is how executive action "circumvents Congress/justice system?"

1) fed background checks
2) waiting time periods 
3) bump stocks 
4) sales of military weapons

429 2018-03-28 20:43:16 same could be said for mining stocks and gold

431 2018-03-28 20:42:30 Your the one that is repealing bump stocks. You also wanted to increase the age to buy guns to 21. You are the problem
432 2018-03-28 20:41:57 The guilt market has been better in terms of return and safety than the regular market. 
Stocks and properties have also done well but at a much higher risk, as always and as in all things, risks equal returns.

448 2018-03-28 20:32:56 I personally don't mind that they took bump stocks away. All bump stocks did was make bad shooters even worst.

We are not there yet...but Nigeria is low key progressing
472 2018-03-28 20:22:02 Their stocks  are dropping a lot of us are droping off to subscriptions
473 2018-03-28 20:21:56 Yes, ban assault rifles. Yes, ban bump stocks. But what about the violence perpetrated against unborn babies every single day? School shooting victims are miniscule in number compared to that.
474 2018-03-28 20:21:15 (2) this is the fault of  the electorate- that's you and me. We send the message og what we the people want when we allow a lobbying group- the NRA- to influence votes with propaganda. Such as bump stocks, which have 0 purpose are "fun" and we all shld own one.
475 2018-03-28 20:21:03 Perfect for gitmo!  Soon Netflix will drop her... Their stocks are already tanking.
476 2018-03-28 20:20:45 UK 10 year guilts do not have a great return. The rich have been buy stocks, property and other overvalued asset classes on low interest rates (cheap money). Yields on treasury bonds are now moving into a bear market and that means greater long term interest rates.

480 2018-03-28 20:18:06 @michaelianblack You are so uninformed. The amendment allows for regulation. There was a 10 yr "assault weapon" ban during which time Columbine occurred & crime rose. Machine guns are no longer legal. Pres Trump is moving to have "bump stocks" outlawed. Read a book for a change
481 2018-03-28 20:17:56 Indeed good luck for only buying stocks during the global honeymoon context for no risk. Guess what, it will be priced in. Today’s risks are tomorrow’s returns.
482 2018-03-28 20:17:51 < Trump is not changing abortion law/policy, he is pro-2nd Amendment but has taken on the NRA to ban bump stocks and go further, and he called the pro-1st Amendment people very fine people, not the KKK. Lower unemployment, more jobs, higher economic confidence, peace with NK, etc
483 2018-03-28 20:17:25 I care about both of these.  Just because they have a negative perception to most doesn’t mean it’s not s good long term stock.  I look at stocks for 1-3 year hold and when i look at CALA FPRX i just can’t imagine in 2 years they will be a 250M MC and 600M MC.

489 2018-03-28 20:16:27 For the record, I know the phrase "it's a stock pickers market" & "it's a market of stocks, not a stock market".........that works IN CONFIRMED UPTRENDS! You will own the very best merchandise.  However, in corrective markets or bear phases, the "M" in CanSlim as in the General
490 2018-03-28 20:16:26 They don’t deserve anything. They don’t know what they are talking about.

492 2018-03-28 20:16:12 Glad I stayed well away from FANG stocks....don't fully understand what they are up to.. not too sure about their leadership. Not nearly boring enough for me.
493 2018-03-28 20:16:04 yeah some sites said it'll be why stocks last when they order.. so idk. i'll just see

497 2018-03-28 20:14:11 Congress can limit the second amendment based on Supreme Ciurt rulings. Universal background checks, AR-15, bump stocks and large magazine bans, waiting periods etc
498 2018-03-28 20:14:06 If you want a theory-we need tougher penalties re illegal gun possessors/crimes. We need to *actually* prosecute those found to have lied on a 4473. We need to get gang members off the streets. We don’t need to ban bump stocks-though i couldn’t care less about the part.
499 2018-03-28 20:13:29 World stocks ex-Europe mostly down: Europe +.5%; US -.3%.  Headline risk drove the market lower with Facebook being investigated & Trump going after Amazon. Difficult market psychologically for investors with fundamentals not driving markets. 1Q earnings to the rescue?

507 2018-03-28 20:07:35 Everyone picks good and bad stocks ..but people now realising that people have made alot of illgotten gains from spoof companies with prefabricated ramps ...and zero substance...many  are now too embarrassed to pump the next piece of rubbish publicly but will try other ways

516 2018-03-28 20:03:04 How are you spread in FANG stocks?
517 2018-03-28 20:01:51 I doubt CBs can stop a reversal...just delay it perhaps.   

If stocks take weeks to top, then I suspect bearish moving average crosses will provide warning.  I'd also keep an eye on the SPY:TLT ratio chart.
518 2018-03-28 20:00:50 If stocks go up, then we'll go higher. If we break lower, you can expect lower stocks

524 2018-03-28 19:57:54 @anton61 Anton you are bipolar!! if you are not sufficiently stable psychologically to accept a loss, do not invest in high-risk stocks

526 2018-03-28 19:56:03 "cripple our economy soon" - is 1% for "prepare to buy stocks".
527 2018-03-28 19:55:27 So, if I just printed TRILLIONS of Yen and wanted to buy US stocks, wonder what that would look like?
528 2018-03-28 19:55:20 If you’re an aggressive stocks then the volatility of those stocks are very high so I still highly doubt you’re getting 20%. 20% is really unheard of.

533 2018-03-28 19:53:42 Have you written or posted anything about the proportion of tech stocks to overall market valuation? I think tech companies alone have been something like 25% - 50% of the entire market rally the past ten years. And so much of that is corporate buybacks.
534 2018-03-28 19:53:11 You planning on tanking anymore stocks because you don't like the CEO of the company? I hope Bezos goes on the attack and wipes you out financially.

Goodness gracious. Noise is everywhere. It’s like being on Facebook after the election, why would you do that to yourself.
537 2018-03-28 19:50:56 So I take it that's your estimate of the '403 timeline. Sounds reasonable. $SELB is holding up nicely in the biotech market mayhem today. Do you follow or are long any other stocks in this space?

551 2018-03-28 19:46:04 Investing in stocks & 401k is great but it’s for sure depended on the market stay strong. One collapse (which will happen soon) can make your investments & 401k look foolish lol
552 2018-03-28 19:45:56 Of the 90-95% social media rift raft regarding stocks, got to be some kind of personal script or mental problem upon which they try to prey on your funds.

553 2018-03-28 19:45:54 Very few stocks hit new all-time highs today on another wacky day for the markets. But here's a stock that hit a record. Lululemon! $LULU up 10% on strong earnings. No more downward dog jokes please.

575 2018-03-28 19:38:18 Did very well with RH, but losing on MU, AMAT, ORGS and CLBS.  Does anyone have any thoughts on any of these stocks.  I’ve been holding hoping for an up tick on these and it just hasn’t.  Don’t know if I should just cut my losses.  ?????

5) 21 To buy a gun

587 2018-03-28 19:35:12 Mr Pena in one of your interviews  you stated that when Sadan Husain  invaded Kuwait, you stated that Kuwait would not sell there oil stocks they had. Can you tell me why  Just very curious why you knew this would happen.
588 2018-03-28 19:35:11 Folks don’t want to repeal the 2nd amendment; they simply want sensible gun laws. Gun show sales must be documented like all other gun sales. Ban assault weapons. Ban huge magazines. Ban bump stocks.

598 2018-03-28 19:30:30 Chicago City Council votes to ban bump stocks & body armor, because those are obviously the 2 most prevalent causes of the 1000s of shooting in the city.  This is what happens when you put a bunch of crooked, uneducated asshats in public office.
599 2018-03-28 19:29:49 Trump did actually call for bump stocks, silencers and extended mags to be outlaw and I'm cool with that.  I draw the line at assault rifles personally
600 2018-03-28 19:29:39 Hi Martin! You can reorder the stocks in your Watchlist by tapping and holding the stock, then dragging it down to a new position in your Watchlist.
601 2018-03-28 19:29:25 The SCOTUS has never held the 2nd Amendment prevents reasonable gun restrictions.  An assault weapon ban is constitutional, just like regulations over fully automatic weapons.  Same for high capacity magazines or bump stocks.  Unlimited 2A is an NRA talking point, nothing more.
602 2018-03-28 19:27:09 I Have about 100 stocks on the Canadian stock exchange in various sectors I watch, is it just me or is almost everyday 90% of stocks on the CSE red? At some point this has to change??????

608 2018-03-28 19:25:28 CitiGroup announced new rules this week that would prevent clients from selling firearms to people who fail background checks, restrict the sales of firearms to people under 21, and ban the sale of bump stocks and high capacity magazines. Take that, @NRA. You're going down fast.

610 2018-03-28 19:25:08 Made a plan late last year to short USDJPY once it hit 115. Good hedge for US stocks going down. Never quite got there. Would have been sweet!
611 2018-03-28 19:24:35 Just don't stand in the way of common sense gun control (btw, arming teachers isn't common sense). No AR's, no bump stocks; no firearms for ppl awaiting trial, domestic abusers; raise the age limit, & strong bg chks & waiting period. We need a balanced SCOTUS, Not ideologues.
612 2018-03-28 19:24:19 Gonna have to get one of those accounts where people shout at companies because a nameless shop no longer stocks chicken katsu n I’m ragin.
613 2018-03-28 19:23:37 you're an idiot. we don't want the 2nd amendment repealed. however, military style weapons, bump stocks, and extended magazines should not be readily available to the public. stronger background checks, as well as said background checks being mandatory.
614 2018-03-28 19:23:07 Hope your right, if your a small cap investor in Canadian stocks right kow your not doing well, hope things turn around at some point! Cheers!
615 2018-03-28 19:23:02 should have made the stocks go up....
616 2018-03-28 19:22:56 STOCKS:  Markets down a little.  it will be fun to watch to see if GOP PACs can turn the market around into the close with huge stock purchases or if "smart money" sales limits any rally.
@TheDemocrats
617 2018-03-28 19:22:35 I suggest increasing the age from 18 to 21 and checking criminal backgrounds and not letting the mentally ill have guns. And maybe banning bump stocks. R u against any of this?

622 2018-03-28 19:19:31 @MLChristiansen I'm pro 2nd amendment and also not a fan of bump stocks. I've tried to find a justifiable reason to have them and I can't. But, I completely agree that the executive branch should not be able to just write them out. I remember criticizing Obama for the same thing.
623 2018-03-28 19:19:21 What Trump does is short term manoeuvering. Populism. Profit per share per quarter. Stocks are goin' up. Fine. The real issues, the real problems of the USA don't exist. Dream on. Just the American Way of Life. So he's right. Pump virtual money, Get read for the real thing, war!
624 2018-03-28 19:18:09 Background checks, waiting periods, raise age to 21, no bump stocks, ok by me (most nra folks say no to these measures!)
625 2018-03-28 19:18:06 My experience with melee players is they have a decent sense of spacing, reaction time, and ability to read in 64, even if they lack matchup knowledge and strong punishes.
So for six stocks they couldn't just get chip damage in, that's impressive.
626 2018-03-28 19:18:02 Ban bumper stocks.
627 2018-03-28 19:17:48 @POTUS @GOP @HouseGOP @HouseDemocrats  I keep hearing about this great new economy, jobs, stocks up, unemployment down. Where? I don't know anyone who has benefitted from these things. Not 1 person in Western PA

631 2018-03-28 19:16:44 "do not attack each other" says the person who calls marco rubio a murderer, who by the way has led the effort for bans on bump stocks, increased background checks, and now the confiscation of firearms from the mentally unstable. More than what all democrats have done, ever. wow.
632 2018-03-28 19:16:20 The "change" I hear the Libtards gnashing their teeth over should be adherence to laws and administrative procedures already in place. Trump is working on tightening the registration system & outlawing "Bump Stocks".
The Parkland shooting was so easily preventable had anyone paid
633 2018-03-28 19:16:18 The list, revised:

Raise minimum age.
Background checks.
Mental health checks.
Licenses to own firearms.
Mandatory safety training & certification.
Mandatory GSW first aid training.
Longer waiting periods.
Limited magazine size.
Make bump stocks illegal.

Also gun owners: actually the "AR" doesn't stand for "assault rifle" it stands for "ArmaLite Rifle" and bump stocks don't make the rifle  automatic because you still have to pull the trigger once per s

641 2018-03-28 19:13:13 It’s 3 PM do you know where your money is? The volatility continues! Big tech stocks still feeling the heat!NASDAQ-76Dow - 80AMZN -75TSLA -24GOOGL-2 AAPL -2 NFLX -13 
642 2018-03-28 19:12:10 $RHT RedHat stocks having a crazy ride since earnings release. Traders ringing the register? Perhaps retracing for new entry says I
643 2018-03-28 19:11:35 But, what if the deep state goes down? Btw, have you seen SM’s stocks lately? The resignations & ongoing investigations? Our President is a Genius & he works for Americans, not deep state, lobbyists or Crooks! FB is probably going to fold... They stole the patents anyway.
644 2018-03-28 19:11:21 When you see stocks selling in the final hour... RUUUNNN! 
More selling near!

646 2018-03-28 19:10:05 I imagine when the stocks were destroyed, the US got all the recipies and the scientists too. Like they did with rocket scientists after ww2
647 2018-03-28 19:09:30 Face planting Swiss Franc and Yen didn’t save stocks. You levered long guys are sunk.
648 2018-03-28 19:09:20 During market euphoria and in retrospect, the stocks that become dogs and just follow the tide up will still be pumped to the moon when they are crashing down by the usual social media rift raft.  A trade is a trade as long as you have a plan and also know what you are buying.
649 2018-03-28 19:09:13 Navarro is talking pure babble about "steel dumping" "tariffs" and  "currency manipulating". Typical of government, the worst thinkers rise  to the top. 

Maybe a sell off in the gold stocks can jump start a new long multi-year uptrend.
650 2018-03-28 19:09:07 Not ruling anything out,a while back we rallied like 600 points in 20 or 30 minutes.

But looks pretty bad right now as more stocks rolling over here.
651 2018-03-28 19:08:52 I’m a car guy have my toys so took my saved car money to do this and and bank on hitting on something by summer.$hpnn and a few other triple 000 stocks I feel like will become great companies eventually and take small accounts and make some nice money. That and learning the day.
652 2018-03-28 19:08:19 Not just natural right, but God given. God wants us to have AR-15’s with extendo clips and bump stocks. Nothing says grace understanding and forgiveness like a sporting rifle
653 2018-03-28 19:08:11 I think bitcoin is stupid but I just put $500 into some Canadian marijuana stocks because someone I know has made about 500% in the last six months trading around with them so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
654 2018-03-28 19:07:54 Just some kind of gun content. Specifically if they use use silencers or bump stocks. But the YT algorithm isn't too bright and hits a lot of channels randomly.
655 2018-03-28 19:07:20 Or the company doesn't even stick around long enough for stocks to vest!

And yes. Tech salaries are high for positions that have the potential to nab patents. Most other jobs—creative, admin, etc.—are still undervalued.

665 2018-03-28 19:03:59 And most Repubs agree to any MOD that makes guns Full Auto like bump stocks are one of them. The extended mags most Repubs I talk to say they qant their Bog mags.

668 2018-03-28 19:01:34 Ppl seem to be ok with trump wanting to ban bump stocks through executive order. NOT OK—that would mean he’s curtailing a right with his pen

670 2018-03-28 19:01:21 @skylanetk bullish stocks now?   Mfeels like the worst is over
671 2018-03-28 19:01:13 Don’t you think if they stopped the selling of semi automatics and bump stocks , all this would go away ?
672 2018-03-28 19:01:10 Does he also pick stocks?
673 2018-03-28 19:01:02 Even good stocks eventually get whooped in a down cycle. Worth remembering. Has little to do with fundamentals. Best to wait until dust clears before buying too soon. $SRPT $SQ $BZUN $MSFT etc etc etc

We have had another big delivery of tropical fish this week including lots of South American Cichlids, Malawi Cichlids and Tanganyikan Cichlids. 

Here are a few pics of a few of the new fish stocks, all available to purchase from Friday.
675 2018-03-28 19:00:45 You’re doing what all Democrats do, your conflating the issues. He was not addressing gun control he was addressing the Second Amendment. He has already banded bump stocks and is working on assault weapons.
676 2018-03-28 19:00:37 Certainly depends on the degree of each miss. Historically, underestimating stocks by a significant degree has not translated into a good day on the CBOT.

682 2018-03-28 18:59:13 I think that it would be easy for $EBML to transition to #bitcoin #cryptocurrency trading platform too.  They already have the foundation in the #gold #silver trading business.
683 2018-03-28 18:58:33 The guns are safe. Bump stocks aren't needed to use a rifle. POTUS banning them gave them time to work on what is needed. Anything "banned" can be overturned later, "pacify" the opposition. 
Doesn't make sence to have something that doesn't conserve ammo anyway, IMO
684 2018-03-28 18:57:44 Who would buy stocks in such a fragile scenario? Increasing geopolitical risks, a possible trade war, tech champions under siege, rising rates, rising Libor and Trump. Just sit and wait

687 2018-03-28 18:57:30 He might be referring to his earlier tweets of Tata motors and Liberty, ever sine he tweeted these stocks are moving to bottom levels... Don’t know what is the use of such generic posts ..
688 2018-03-28 18:57:08 #twitterpoll ☛ Which sell-off of these small-cap #biotech stocks would you buy today $GERN $MGNX $NVTA $OMER? Cast your vote ☛ #folloMe @biotech_forum if you want to see more daily polls like these!
689 2018-03-28 18:57:02 according to the polls, at most the NRA reflects a minority opinion and at worst creates the minority opinion for a minority of people to follow.  most people want background checks and want to see assault rifles & bump stocks banned from being sold.
690 2018-03-28 18:56:53 There are different types of gun violence. Assault rifles have been the weapon of choice in most of the recent massacres. Add high-capacity clips & bump stocks to the mix & the potential for mass murder in a very short period of time skyrockets. These items will be banned.
691 2018-03-28 18:56:43 but if a ban on bump stocks makes it to the House you and Cedric will vote for. Of that I have no doubt!

695 2018-03-28 18:56:04 Hey Peter, if you knew anything about the stock market, it is a gauge on the FUTURE direction of the economy. Do you buy stocks on companies that have made alot of profit in the past, or on companies that will make alot of money in the future??!!!
696 2018-03-28 18:56:02 Lmao they just didn’t need part time people anymore fool, I’m workin with jon
697 2018-03-28 18:55:16 But nobody’s trying to actually repeal the second amendment… They just want it well regulated, as it states. Trump’s just trying to stir people up. 
PS: Me and my husband both own guns. He’s a vet. We both want AR15s and bump stocks banned.
698 2018-03-28 18:55:00 We also have the new “evil gun “restrictions. No pistol grip on rifles, no fore grips, no extendable stocks..... etc.

702 2018-03-28 18:53:02 Ya know, if Democrats knew how to buy stocks,, they'd do this sort of dump and pump, too.
703 2018-03-28 18:52:47 Wrong. Tabloid journalist
704 2018-03-28 18:52:09 I trade crappy stocks and bank big :-)
705 2018-03-28 18:51:29 The other point is myspace is worth 7.5 million dollars today. My main point is why are stocks worth anything .
706 2018-03-28 18:51:12 I used to think that way too, but I'm a bit more lax now. I'm more into good relative volume and low float. Those are signs of a reversal point to me, on oversold stocks.

712 2018-03-28 18:49:44 Stocks outta nowhere wtf lol
713 2018-03-28 18:49:06 What I was saying is that bump stocks should have never been legal  in the first place one reason is if you modify a gun by shorting it or buy modifying it to be fully automatic weapons is against the law already so how did bump stocks make it's way to be legal?
714 2018-03-28 18:48:50 lol so i was on my way to school to test and on the way home we where going 40 cause it was ice and ths MOTHER FICKING GUY TAILS US PASSES US AND FLIPS US OF TURNS ON OUR ROAD AND FOLLOWS US AND FUCKING STOCKS US AND THREATENS US WITH A HAMMER WTF ill keep u posted

719 2018-03-28 18:47:32 There have to b rules & regulations to all who r licensed research investment firms that call themselves analysts in the market to influence the ups & downs of stocks.

723 2018-03-28 18:45:55 Expand background checks to include private & gun show sales
Ban high capacity magazines
Ban bump stocks

Things I TRULY believe should be done, but won't be:

Ban Military style rifles, cuz they cause more destruction
mandatory MENTAL health checks, before you can buy a gun

733 2018-03-28 18:41:11 Fair enough. There's plenty of hype and (often) unfounded exuberance the other way. A combination of greed & casino-style optimism have pushed stocks high only to have them crash on too many occasions. Tesla's price is based on future earnings skeptics don't think will happen.
734 2018-03-28 18:41:00 Topping was more like a one hour event for Bitcoin!  Classic bubble charts depict a sudden crash, followed by a dead cat bounce.  Do you think central bank intervention extends the topping process in stocks?

737 2018-03-28 18:40:03 Some weeks ago these companies wered called great and optimism was very high and all this should be questioned now? People still use $GOOGL $AMZN $NFLX $TWTR and they do not even know that there stocks has been falling last days. 
If $AMZN will fall 20-30% or more I will buy some
738 2018-03-28 18:39:13 Just because I want to establish a 401k at a young age and invest in growing stocks DOESNT MEAN I DONT WANT AN ICY GRILL THAT I CAN WEAR ON THE WEEKENDS OK
739 2018-03-28 18:38:49 The commonly discussed proposals: ban of military-style weapons; limiting magazine capacity; making bump stocks illegal; tightening up the background check database and making the checks mandatory; etc. will all help.
740 2018-03-28 18:38:34 Except the economy is about to boom and the debt-to-GDP is likely to rapidly shrink similar to late 1940s and early 1950s over the next decade. But, we see the downside risk for the next 18 months in stocks, or a crash later this year... $SPX
741 2018-03-28 18:38:02 No, only the 78% of Americans who own no guns at all, and the 95% of gun owners who think a nationwide database to check backgrounds on potential gun purchasers is exactly what we need. As well as a ban on bump stocks and military style assault rifles. But no one else.
742 2018-03-28 18:36:51 Two. Earnings should be out early May, in my opinion I think they surprise to the good. But as with all stocks, don’t take somebody else’s advice and do your own  due diligence.
743 2018-03-28 18:36:30 Make sure you remember this when capitulating to the dems over bump stocks and other irrelevant accessories that gets them one step closer to their ultimate goal....Ban all firearms and repeal the 2nd amendment!
744 2018-03-28 18:35:43 Ya but it was Obama administration that said bump stocks are are legal to have.
745 2018-03-28 18:35:38 You made your point and that you are not satisfied. But you are full in attack on stocks.
746 2018-03-28 18:35:37 Invest in Benadryl stocks.
747 2018-03-28 18:33:36 he can't buy a "cool Mil" of $TSLA ... BECAUSE HE HAS NO ACTUAL CASH...his net worth is all tied up in his stocks...and he takes out loans and uses his stock options as collateral for the banks...Do people really think he is actually a "billionaire"?
748 2018-03-28 18:33:13 Mr President you heard the left... if you give them bump stocks they will take a mile. Don't give them anything!
749 2018-03-28 18:32:34 start shorting the fantasy stocks, my pet unicorn told me.

757 2018-03-28 18:30:40 Then stop threatening gun control with the bump stocks.

763 2018-03-28 18:29:52 I don't have a problem with guns. I support 2A. But we need reform - no assault weapons, no high capacity magazines, no bump stocks, better background checks and I am not against a National Registry. Hell, our vehicles get registered.

Highly trained expert teachers will be allowed to conceal carry, subject to State Law. Armed guards OK, deterrent!.
766 2018-03-28 18:29:07 If it wasn't for the NRA and their incessant lobbying/bribing/blackmail, would bump stocks have been legal in a post Columbine America?
 Would the Parkland shooter have been able to so easily get his weapon?
Who would still be alive if the NRA was really concerned about safety?

787 2018-03-28 18:18:42 No, we blame the NRA and the @GOP who are against a ban on military assault rifles and bump stocks. These were not around when the 2nd amendment was written and have no business being in the hands of any civilian.

816 2018-03-28 18:04:00 I have laid in extra stocks.
817 2018-03-28 18:03:13 Yes it's fake. It also represents the true motive behind the "movement."
"We take your bump stocks, we take everything else next."
"You are no longer allowed to buy bullets." #dws 
It's also about the celebrities and  #DNC money.
What a joke. People are wise to your lies.
818 2018-03-28 18:03:12 Keep your eye on NETFLIX Stocks folks. They just hired Susan (Benghazi was caused by a YouTube video) Rice. This should go over like a ton of bricks.
819 2018-03-28 18:03:10 Ar 15 is not an assault weapon

Bump stocks were permitted by none other than your hero OBAMA

I don't have a problem getting rid of bump stocks

Do you know what an assault weapon is?

Look it up
820 2018-03-28 18:03:06 If you haven't noticed, cannabis stocks are largely built on payday loans, and earnings remain largely hopes and dreams. The sector is still overvalued heavily relative to any fundamental benchmarks or any actual earnings.

How much weight do you give these reports in your business planning?
829 2018-03-28 17:59:48 If you are talking about the mkt in general. What I do is hold my longs and never sell except when the story changes. Even now. But I hedge/short other stocks and the indices and make $$$ net, including longs, assuming I am correct.
830 2018-03-28 17:59:41 $ALAD is one of those stupid stocks I should definitely not be in but I totally can’t resist so took 50 shares short. Will hold to zero haha or as close as possible. Sorry for the terrible discipline in advance.
831 2018-03-28 17:59:40 you mean like that 1.50 ? and its already been proven, the companies used the tax breaks to buy back stocks , pay bigger dividends  pay down their debt and not help the average worker , quit being a liar like trump ...your not good at it ...knee pads ryan
832 2018-03-28 17:59:33 I am dumfounded why the LOCAL authorities are getting away unscathed from these Broward County murders.  From School Superintendent, to Board of Education, to Sheriff's Department.  Meanwhile the Left has tricked the Right into rallying around Bump Stocks.

845 2018-03-28 17:52:59 Sure, lots of idealogical essays. Here are the facts: no gun legislation has passed Congress since 2007. Even after horrific mass shootings, Congress refuses to legislate low hanging fruit like bump stocks or minimum age for purchase. Rest easy, you will die owning all your guns.
846 2018-03-28 17:52:57 Today...it’s tanking my stocks.
847 2018-03-28 17:52:00 Here are the policy demands from @50milesmore march. Ban personal possession of military grade weapons, ban bump stocks, four day waiting period on all gun purchases, required background checks, and raise legal purchasing age of all guns to 21. @nbc15_madison

855 2018-03-28 17:47:40 My best investments in terms of cumulative returns so far in this order have been 
1. My degrees
2. Stocks/401k 
3. My house.

The last two is because the financial crisis occurred when I was in college and was turning the corner as I left. Perfect time to buy a house and stock.

867 2018-03-28 17:42:56 Did you happen to consider the final words of the second amendment when you signed to have bump-stocks banned?  That little pesky phrase always shows me how much a politician respects the rule of law and the constitution -- "SHALL NOT BE INFRINGED."
868 2018-03-28 17:42:33 True, but if the larger investors start bailing then it gives me the opportunity to buy stocks at a lower price. As it is now I can't afford it. LOL

870 2018-03-28 17:42:11 Higher age requirements. No assault weapons. Period. No bump stocks. Waiting period along with proper training. Like we have to be able to drive a car. Registration. Mandatory yearly registration. Like we have with cars.

877 2018-03-28 17:40:14 Stocks go up and down. The underlying data is pretty positive. Most libs don’t want Americans to suffer just  to gain back power. And you?

881 2018-03-28 17:38:39 “They’ll give us bump stocks,  we’ll take a mile.” — That inspires no one to find middle ground.
882 2018-03-28 17:38:18 Umm...most stocks have things like revenues and earnings. The comparison between two totally different asset classes and their historical price movements is not enough evidence to justify owning BTC. Am I missing something?
883 2018-03-28 17:37:21 People in rural areas probably need guns due to wildlife they encounter that the average urban or suburban citizen doesn’t.  And some u/s folks will need guns for other sound reasons. None need AR-14 or similar guns or bump stocks that mimic that performance.

888 2018-03-28 17:35:16 Democrats don't want to repeal 2nd amendment, want assault weapons, high capacity clips, and bump stocks outlawed.  Most Democrats in my state hunt, so we want hunting guns.
889 2018-03-28 17:34:52 U may be right in case of large diversification, But WB portfolio consist few 15-20 stocks, where quality is more important than value (does not mean overpay but fair value)

895 2018-03-28 17:32:47 The #NASDAQ is just below the line. Only -35.4 points down. It is sitting at 6,937 points as of right now!

898 2018-03-28 17:31:40 Yikes. Sell your Netflix stocks!
899 2018-03-28 17:31:21 im using the 21 to trade from both sides...looking for stocks showing strength to go long above, and short those exhibiting weakness below. one day at a time with this approach.
900 2018-03-28 17:31:17 Both political parties were talking about infrastructure. Good case for US funding gap notes @JayJacobsCFA @GlobalXFunds. $PAVE holds stocks @cfraresearch likes  such as $FAST $WLK $EMR. #ETFIQ
901 2018-03-28 17:31:13 @Tony_BATtista We raised rates, but bank stocks are still under heavy pressure. Please discuss with hippie gentleman that sits next to you and wears the same hat everyday, with your opinion on them an any potential opportunity you may see! #TastyTom #whitemandoorag
902 2018-03-28 17:31:07 Your delusional- we want regulation, make bump stocks illegal, better-deeper and background checks, longer waiting periods, i think a limit on Semi Automatic rifles owned per individual.
903 2018-03-28 17:30:59 A majority of Americans with advanced education did not vote for Trump. Who do you think owns stocks, HS dropouts?
904 2018-03-28 17:30:31 It’s currently available to anyone who pays taxes and qualifies.
905 2018-03-28 17:30:18 True safety only lies with future Supreme Chancellor @davidhogg111 He shall liberate us and lead us to true glory under a new government, a Hogg government. And a nation without bump stocks.
906 2018-03-28 17:29:56 A lot of stocks look fairly oversold here...
907 2018-03-28 17:29:44 I think the issue is most stocks are up so much people are happy to wait it out
908 2018-03-28 17:29:41 Or businesses can use the Money for stock buybacks. Speaking of stocks Pauly, have you got any insider trading tips you can share with the class?
909 2018-03-28 17:29:36 Well I am long gold/gold stocks bcz I expect inflationary depression. I dont count on China to speed up the demise of current fiat system and push gold up thru petroyuan bcz it has vested interest in the system and wants to replicate it in case of $ demise.
910 2018-03-28 17:29:28 the next trip through lows is gonna be insane in stocks
911 2018-03-28 17:29:22 I consider the scraps of stock my employer gives me just unexpected income, so it’s hilarious to me watching tech stocks tank, and I am very here for it.
912 2018-03-28 17:29:21 Then don't restrict the People in their right. Bump stocks can be replaced with a finger. It's just a loose held gun. Accuracy is poor, control is poor and no one uses them. Their just a Rambo attachment. Focus on securing our elections, removing illegals and building the wall.
913 2018-03-28 17:29:13 U.K. stocks higher at close of trade; #FTSE 100 up 0.65%
914 2018-03-28 17:29:07 Elizabeth, over time gold has extremely low correlation with stocks, which means it is not a good real time hedge. It is, however, the most effective time tested safe haven, liquidity reserve and systemic insurance, all of which work when bad things happens.
915 2018-03-28 17:28:59 It's generally more a function of the number of setups I can find and how well my positions are performing.  The individual stocks guide me more than the indexes.
916 2018-03-28 17:28:22 Germany stocks lower at close of trade; #DAX down 0.25%
917 2018-03-28 17:27:16 "7 stocks to buy on the dip" <-- just hit my Inbox!
918 2018-03-28 17:26:35 Obama admin did NOT legalize bump stocks. Try telling the truth just once, old man.
919 2018-03-28 17:26:32 Trading risks include 2 death traps that can be happening in this correction. Disposition Effect and not cutting losses.. and trading popular stocks like FANG. These are efficiently priced and it’s unlikely a trader can beat the market.
920 2018-03-28 17:26:30 I think, as always in similar cases general cause is that some investors decides that better for them to sell stocks. But why they decides to do in that way exactly know only to them.

925 2018-03-28 17:24:36 I thought passive funds (e.g. index funds) are the best option for the average person who has no ability to pick stocks or make good investment decisions?
926 2018-03-28 17:24:33 Stocks down so I just bout 4 more
927 2018-03-28 17:24:27 Exactly.  But also historical trends show stocks increasing greatly after any recession . But QE made sure we didn't have another recession
928 2018-03-28 17:24:16 I read Obama legalized bump stocks too
929 2018-03-28 17:24:11 No more compromising; bump stocks; age limit hypocracy; they do not deserve an inch of slack!
930 2018-03-28 17:23:48 @stash You won't carry any "hedge" options on your "investment" app yet you do now sell tech stocks. All your options are progressive in worldview. If no change, the money goes back in a bank.

934 2018-03-28 17:21:29 For last few weeks we are updating sector specific stocks.After Banking, Metals, FMCG next will be Textile stocks. Checking Arvind, Century Tex, VIP Clothing, Raymond
935 2018-03-28 17:21:18 I hate this situation. There is enough history on gold mining stocks, for example, to be pretty certain that they'll drop together with rest of stock market, which is why I sold them all. No such history in BTC, yet. Don't know what to do in medium term (1-2 years).

937 2018-03-28 17:19:56 Any specific stocks that you're referring to?
938 2018-03-28 17:19:47 Why should a tax credit not apply to legal landed immigrants?
939 2018-03-28 17:19:32 Bump stocks are in the process of being banned and the parts needed to convert semi automatics to full autos are treated and regulated just the same as the weapons themselves. Is your point that it is too easy to convert these weapons or you want ARs banned altogether?
940 2018-03-28 17:19:27 STOCKS FRUSTRATING GOP/PACs:  Looks to me like GOP PACs & Wall Street have propping up stocks with large concentrated purchases.  But then "smart money" comes in & sells rallies, frustrating the GOP. 
If you want to reduce exposure in your 401k, sell the rallies?

942 2018-03-28 17:18:53 Stocks fall on FB data breach! Stocks fall on tough trade talk! Stocks rise on trade stance moderation!
943 2018-03-28 17:18:28 Sometimes the stocks spring to life. But I hear most of the time it's an up-and-down type industry.
944 2018-03-28 17:17:57 Company such as CItron Research really does not deserve to have a license as an analyst. He bashes stocks & companies without facts nor any intelligence, but only based on intention of a quick profit 4 himself.
945 2018-03-28 17:16:55 I’d rather have a nation that thinks outside this mental prison and does away with AR15s and bump stocks and drastically reduces the number of firearms in circulation.

980 2018-03-28 17:04:13 No Mr.Graham you and your party do not get to change the narrative of #NeverAgain #VoteForOurLives. It is NOT a repeal of the 2ndA but common sense laws on semi automatic rifles and bump stocks. Who’s side are you on? Guns or Children.

997 2018-03-28 16:59:51 DWS/40 had knocked him down but I lowered the weight for it and he moved up. Think the major difference is lack of stocks/defensive stats and obv usage/FTA
998 2018-03-28 16:59:41 Retail investors have been burned so many times trying to raise cash on every decline that they have given in to the concept that stocks will ultimately go up. We need a sharper flush to get panic.

1007 2018-03-28 16:56:47 Republicans and Democrats are together in wanting stronger gun sense laws. AR weapons need to be banned as well as bump stocks, gun purchases over the age of 21, enhanced criminal background checks,mental health-red flag laws put in place.
1008 2018-03-28 16:56:16 Some stocks look pretty stable here,many tech stocks really struggling.I have to assume every bounce will be sold until proven otherwise.
1009 2018-03-28 16:55:18 If you would use your head, you could figure out it is not all people that own guns that do the shootings. I agree that assault rifles are not needed especially bump stocks. Mental health needs to be improved plus respect for life and one another.
1010 2018-03-28 16:55:17 No I don't want a ban. I and many who are supporting the March for our Lives movement want universal background checks, repeal of the Dickey Amendment, an increase on the minimum age to purchase a gun, a ban on bump stocks, and a ban on the sale of AR-15s.

1016 2018-03-28 16:52:55 I'm well aware of what an AR15 is you pathetic piece of garbage. Eliminating one particular type of gun IS NOT A GUN BAN. Bump stocks are also not guns, in case you were curious. Answer the question, what is in your closet that would prevent you from owning a firearm?
1017 2018-03-28 16:52:36 The only guns that should be banned is assault weapons and ones like that.  Bump Stocks are evil however there’s gotta be better laws to prevent issues like Parkland. If they banned guns then the attacking would be knives or bombs

Mobilizes people with common sense to vote against left.
Clockwork.
1023 2018-03-28 16:51:26 The ban on bump stocks came only after the nationwide March for our lives movement. If the students from Parkland didn’t raise the movement, I’m sure no legislation would have passed. I’m with you on the Obama peace prize thing, I don’t get why he got one. Obama doesn’t too!

1025 2018-03-28 16:50:44 Ban bump stocks, magazines that hold more than 10 rounds and assault weapons..NO citizen in the US needs these things to protect
themselves or to hunt. The same ban that was in effect in this country from 1994 -2004.  When mass shootings dropped 34% & have now increased 183%
1026 2018-03-28 16:50:19 @TheJusticeDept @CommerceGov @FBI 
Care to look into that sell off of FB stocks?
Not that it looks suspicious or anything.

1029 2018-03-28 16:48:10 the bonds breached  the 3% level from above... now alll we need is new highs in stocks by end of weekk to  complete a full lobogola
   in both flexions
1030 2018-03-28 16:48:05 And dumps stock market prices! But that will not effect the ones that follow the man in the White House, they probably aren't rich enough to have any stocks.
1031 2018-03-28 16:48:01 One would think longs may start to see some margin calls who are heavily weighted in FANG like momentum tech stocks
1032 2018-03-28 16:47:58 "Only bump stocks" so far given the record of all the better presidents according to you,isnt that progress.And I guess if Obama had thought of implementing the wall,he would have probably got another Nobel peace prize.

1035 2018-03-28 16:47:40 all reputable news CNN the Wall street journal is Fake News, but he promotes the enquirer?  Stop your killing me. He didn't even win the election fair.  Oh I get it you have stocks that are going up, because of his big mouth and cheating, OMG!
1036 2018-03-28 16:46:09 So oil stocks are a bad investment but mall stocks are a great investment? Got it
1037 2018-03-28 16:45:44 Their stocks wouldn’t be worth much.
1038 2018-03-28 16:45:32 a weapon that is used solely for killing. and i include in that definition, bump stocks and high capacity magazines that turn an ordinary gun into a gun that would only ever be needed to kill. if you really think those should be accessible to the public, there lies the problem.
1039 2018-03-28 16:44:31 Wrong! NOBODY wants to take peoples guns away, they want them stop the selling of automatic weapons and bump stocks. There is No reason an AR15 needs to be sold...look what they've done
1040 2018-03-28 16:44:02 these are great sales here in stocks, $SPY stays below 262.50
1041 2018-03-28 16:43:59 OK do one thing
1.create a portfolio consist of quality stocks like Nestle,pidilite,CRISIL, Britannia, Dabur etc.,(2007 EPS)
2.Assume to bought at avg PE of 40 
Check that with current price.And also returns.
1042 2018-03-28 16:43:39 Trump tweet that the stock market will fluctuate as TRADE DEALS are renegotiated. Stocks will go up or down based on the specifics DEALS made! CONGRESS wants to maintain status quo TRADE DEALS which they personally benefit from! They've watered down INSIDER TRADING LAWS for them!
1043 2018-03-28 16:43:36 This is not about taking guns away. It is banning military assault rifles w bump stocks and multiple mags sold to average American citizens.Americans do not need this to protect their family as was the 2nd anendedment intention and was written before these weapons existed.
1044 2018-03-28 16:42:33 Yes  you are right sir-the way stocks are oversold need a little bounce n again start a new journey with results..!
1045 2018-03-28 16:42:27 Managing stocks is a humbling experience...anyone who does this for a living knows this..
1046 2018-03-28 16:42:04 Oh yes, here's one for you: why do you not stock just black olives? I can buy mixed green and black or all manner of pots of green, but not black on their own. A strange omission. Told you Glastonbury is odd with what it stocks.
1047 2018-03-28 16:42:00 Oh you didnt get the memo. Out of the increased military budget, he’s trying to get funding for his border wall, only bump stocks banned so far, and relations with North Korea are still on thin ice. Besides he has started a trade war, and stocks have had record dips.
1048 2018-03-28 16:41:59 ...and bump stocks outlawed. We also want abusers to not have access to guns. A lot of us own guns but we recognize the issue at hand and we DEMAND that steps be taken.
1049 2018-03-28 16:41:51 I think EDm/z9 may have another 25bps to go higher especially if stocks do not cooperate as T-Bill issuance has been very front-loaded so far. In March, after tomorrow's auction, there would be more T-Bills issued than all of last year (net).
1050 2018-03-28 16:41:10 The @AMarch4OurLives movement needs to be realistic. You've already sacked bump stocks and instructed police to confiscate guns. What more can even be done? Lidar technology could probably provide early warning and automatic mitigation.
1051 2018-03-28 16:40:59 ...not just in $SPY but in all stocks, especially the leadership tech and social media companies.
1052 2018-03-28 16:40:33 looks like #DAX30 is working out some kind of temp bottom zone up above it's low of 2018. Expect higher prices if the little bullishness holds on & we get green close #stocks #trading

1057 2018-03-28 16:39:41 I’m finding the #potstock drop amusing. We saw a nearly 85% gain in $hemp the last two days. I sold at 1.88 ... These stocks have the ability to do that at any time. Just pop on news. I averaged down on hemp and it worked for me. Don’t panic now. Stick to the plan

Keep 20-30% of ur Portfolio  value in debt.

Buy those stocks which r having
-D/E Ratio is below 0.75 
-Last 3yrs CAGR 15%+
-Sound Management
-Better Utilisation Capacity
-Future Growth or Expansion Plan

1073 2018-03-28 16:34:17 Of course nobody is arguing for the right to shoot kids down but all of the men and women who have fought for our country didn’t do so to defend the right of private citizens to own bump stocks and semi-automatic weapons. Again, it’s not about banning guns, it’s about safety.

1084 2018-03-28 16:30:18 European Stocks were led lower by Technology companies on persistent concerns over a regulatory crackdown and falls in major tech stocks overnight.
1085 2018-03-28 16:30:13 U.S.Stocks stumbled again as jitters about a U.S.-China trade war and the regulatory crackdown on tech firms left investors facing their first quarterly fall in equity markets in two years.
1086 2018-03-28 16:30:04 On the negative, it was a difficult day for mining stocks with Antofagasta and Anglo American leading the days fallers, dropping 3.9% and 3.8% respectively.
1087 2018-03-28 16:29:56 Elsewhere it was a positive day for defensive companies, led by the utility stocks which were up across the board. Untied Utilities finished the day up 8.3%, Severn Trent were up 6.1% and National Grid were up 5.5%

1090 2018-03-28 16:29:36 The UK100 experienced another day in the black, building on yesterdays strong performance. There was some initial weakness at the open as a negative day for U.S. markets, led by a fall in tech stocks, filtered through to Europe.

1106 2018-03-28 16:25:50 They’ve seen the numbers. They’ve experienced a school shooting. They know the USA is the only developed nation in the world with this problem. 
But sure, the real problem is they just don’t know enough about “bump stocks”.
1107 2018-03-28 16:25:43 No....proposed solutions include bump stocks, hardening the schools, coordinated mental health efforts among law enforcement, so far.

1112 2018-03-28 16:24:51 Actually bump stocks are used to modify semi-automatic guns and turn them into machine guns, which is what the Vegas shooter used. So wrong.

1126 2018-03-28 16:19:29 The Dems didn’t say they wanted it repealed- a retired REPUBLICAN Supreme Justice called for that! They just want common sense gun laws- increased background checks, no bump stocks & no AR15’s for civilians. #GunReformNow #NRAbloodMoney #StableGenius

1138 2018-03-28 16:15:05 To buy any gun legally you have to go through a back ground check, bump stocks I agree but AR-15 are not any more deadly than most other weapons, there are guns with higher caliber but because a shooter hasn’t used them they aren’t being attacked
1139 2018-03-28 16:13:54 Yeah and don’t ban bump stocks either. What a betrayal that was
1140 2018-03-28 16:13:51 And you should be thanking the Obama administration for saving our 401k's and stocks after the last republican potus had his hands on it.

1151 2018-03-28 16:10:48 Some people invest in stocks and bonds, I invest in concert tickets hoping someone will be desperate enough to pay a ridiculous amount for them.
1152 2018-03-28 16:10:28 Glad to see you say that but I guess then that means you’re ok with just picking it to pieces with Fix NICS and the regulatory action on bump stocks and your stated goal to ban 18 to 20 year olds from exercising there rights to the Second Amendment.
1153 2018-03-28 16:10:18 A person’s wealth isn’t measured in silver or gold, nor in stocks or bonds, it’s not in real estate or Swiss Bank accounts. You can spot a wealthy person by the contentment in their heart, and the happiness in their eyes.

1162 2018-03-28 16:08:19 Better argument would be the SCOTUS DCvsHeller decision. Scalia says the 2A doesnt "secure" the right to own ANY gun & later says it prohibits "dangerous and unusual weapons". AR15s w/ ext mags & bmp stocks are dangerous & unusual weapons of war.

1183 2018-03-28 16:01:30 This is ridiculous!  The @AMarch4OurLives was not about repealing 2nd Amendment.  It was to push for stricter laws like increasing age of buyers, banning bump stocks, banning assault rifles.  Those kids have not said outlaw all firearms.

1192 2018-03-28 15:59:21 Thank you Mr. President!

Now....let's be clear on bump stocks.

They do NOT alter the mechanics
of the firearm. ONE trigger pull  sends ONE round thru the barrel.

Any questions?

Again....thank you.
1193 2018-03-28 15:58:45 @DLoesch Can someone plainly explain to me the good/bad of "bump stocks?" With the war on information out there and not being a gun owner but wholeheartedly supporting #2A, it's hard to know the truth

1211 2018-03-28 15:53:46 And if you read what they are asking for you will see that it is much more than just assault rifles ban, they want to raise the age, make it harder to buy guns, get rid of bump stocks. We have to learn to drive a car, take a test to drive, register our vehicle, etc. why not guns?
1212 2018-03-28 15:53:42 Machine /auto guns are banned. Bump stocks are suppose to make a semi auto more like a full auto. Yeah. Ban it. Shouldn't be allowed.

Do you not think they’ll also we should have a clear delineated line (or list) of what’s allowed and not allowed as far as the actual weapons go? What about bump stocks, tri burst etc?

1244 2018-03-28 15:41:26 passive investing helped on the way up as FANG became bigger % of the indexes. Now it can bite back, as FANG becomes smaller % of the index there will be "Real" sellers of the stocks everyday they drop.

1255 2018-03-28 15:39:09 I've seen in the past regardless of technicals where stocks sell off massively after hitting certain "big number levels". Then massive sell volume comes in and creates a cascade effect as multiple stop loss levels are continuously hit. Like a "flash crash".

1259 2018-03-28 15:37:17 Stricter controls on anything that can make a gun rapid fire..
Rapid fire devices are controlled by ATF & their legality defined by them.  Under Obama's admin, ATF stated bump stocks were legal because they don't mechanically alter the firearm. Trump is seeking redefinition.

All of which were overturned by the Republican Congress who also kept any sort of regulation on weapons from being brought forward.

1279 2018-03-28 15:32:57 I'm sceptical of the numbers and so wouldn't put much weight on the story - figures from Spain are big enough to skew it, and there may be other big missing figures (equivalent of penny stocks in US is junior bourse elsewhere, but many missing - back in 1999 would be a big gap)
1280 2018-03-28 15:32:51 This doesn't look good here as the market is unable to create any sort of rally here. Every little uptick is just used to dump more stock imo. It feels as if we are at the verge of rolling over for real here. #stocks #nasdaq #nyse
1281 2018-03-28 15:32:34 Any failure to abide by safe gun ownership and state and federal laws will result in revocation of license. AR-15s and their like, bump stocks and large capacity magazines will only be available to the military. Not much different than what is required for car ownership, no?
1282 2018-03-28 15:32:25 Maybe now's a good time to shore up my portfolio with dictionary stocks. 
1283 2018-03-28 15:32:08 MOST people don't have the educational background to invest in stocks but it's not a guaranteed form of payment unlike government bonds. There's a risk you will lose all you've invested in stocks.

1291 2018-03-28 15:29:57 At this the only rational response to any attempt to restrict gun gun rights is to pass an extension to gun rights equal or greater to the attempted infringement. You want to Ban Bump stocks? We legalize suppressors. You want to tax ammo? We institute national ccw reciprocity. 1/

1293 2018-03-28 15:28:46 This is just dispicable. So banning bump stocks and lowering the size of a magazine is repeal of second amendment? You know, the second amendment also says “in order to maintain a well regulated Militia”. What about the Russian money? Where’d that end up?
1294 2018-03-28 15:28:40 I think the self driving part of the Tesla is more of an issue here, but your point stands. If stocks would drop for every car after every fatal accident due to mechanical (or electronic these days) failure...

1405 2018-03-28 15:02:12 FANG stocks and trade war fears taking down the entire market. Today will be a red day. On the last pullback in March it lasted 3 days before it turned around. Since its a long weekend we may have to wait until Tuesday #PotStocks
1406 2018-03-28 15:01:55 I have no issue with getting rid of bump stocks. Assault weapons are needed if the goal is to defend from a rouge regime.
1407 2018-03-28 15:01:54 The only thing that's frustrated more than losing out on a breakout is not having any dry powder when your favorite stocks come down to GUT BUY LEVELS !! #NeedToImprove if i want to start my own HF #KnossosCapital
1408 2018-03-28 15:01:37 Tech stocks are in for another volatile day as Tuesday’s selloff gave way to a pre-market roller coaster.

1409 2018-03-28 15:01:33 Cool but tweet something good about steel and aluminum. Stocks are getting destroyed but especially these sectors. Thought you were going to protect these for national security???
1410 2018-03-28 15:01:33 It'd mean more if he wasn't banning bump stocks

1418 2018-03-28 14:59:05 Very few prognosticators should be listened to at all. Most are educated but predicting stock market moves has proven futile for all but a few. Volatile markets are part of the deal. Here is my investing principle:
Capitalism works therefore I own stocks for the very long term.

Successful businessman? He called himself "The King of Debt". Bankrupt four times. He inherited a fortune -and would have more money now -if he'd left it in Stocks.
1424 2018-03-28 14:57:40 THE SECOND AMENDMENT NEEDS TO BE DEFINED DONALD! THE 2nd AMENDMENT DOES NOT COVER BUMP-STOCKS AND ASSAULT RIFLES! The Second AMENDMENT talks about Weapons for a well regulated Militia DONALD which is our military... STOP GASLIGHTING people into believing you actually care!
1425 2018-03-28 14:57:36 Then quit signing stuff that takes away a little by little I think you're ignorant when it comes to guns and the Second Amendment Trump do not sign the bill to take away bump stocks it's a slippery slope you heard the girl
1426 2018-03-28 14:57:24 FANG stocks were already tanking (fb amzn Netflix google)
1427 2018-03-28 14:57:02 That's fine. We don't need to repeal it, but how about much stricter gun controls? How about banning assault weapons, bump stocks and high capacity magazines? Can you do that? Or do you have your dick in a vice by the NRA?
1428 2018-03-28 14:56:48 $ACAD $AIMT $EXEL $GLYC Its mostly a sector cycling down, see the IBB chart. Many stocks Over Sold. And many thought it was already at the bottom. Time to BUY into the pain. IBB at OverSold.

1430 2018-03-28 14:55:50 I was all for banning bump stocks and limiting the power of some rifles a few weeks ago. After seeing the Maoism spewed yesterday at #RepealTheSecondAmendment rally yesterday, I'm leaning towards nothing being done. These people want no guns and no self protection.
1431 2018-03-28 14:55:49 No, those who employ analysts get paid more to defend failing stocks.

1443 2018-03-28 14:52:48 I don’t care for him much since he pushed the ban on bump stocks and raising the age to own a gun. However, the fact you said that on a post where he is supporting the second amendment shows you want him repealed BECAUSE he’s guarding it. So quit trying to take our rights, thanks

1450 2018-03-28 14:51:12 It’s been a mess for a long time. Tons of debt that they will not be able to pay back. A lot of tech stocks have run up with this Notion that they will make money someday. But in reality they will not & the small investors will be holding the bag while the Big investors make $$$

1454 2018-03-28 14:50:38 That's true, but when students say 'when they give an inch like banning bump stocks we will take a mile.' Ban one semi-automatic rifle just because it is scary is one thing, but 90 percent of all guns are semi-automatic. Can the left keep their word. Review history for the answer
1455 2018-03-28 14:50:16 You do understand that your initial comment didn’t say that. I know people who try their hardest and come up short. Many are on the edge with no safety net- a car problem leads to a payday loan which destroys them. Stocks are the stuff of fantasy for them.

1549 2018-03-28 14:30:12 With all of that being said I think the most sane thing to do about the 2A issue is to enforce stricter background checks and a series of physiological tests as well. Also ban bump stocks.
1550 2018-03-28 14:29:50 Gun owner and CC in NY. I'm for sensible gun regulations, background checks, no gun show or private sales, waiting periods, ban high capacity mags and bump stocks, permits for handguns, 5 round max rifle mag, mandatory training, rules for storage

1558 2018-03-28 14:27:21 Just ban assault weapons, bump stocks, things that make it insanely easy to walk into a location and gun down 20 people. More stringent restrictions to get them at least. Seems pretty self explanatory.
1559 2018-03-28 14:27:00 I need better patience when im trading stocks every morning
1560 2018-03-28 14:26:55 But dwindling conviction in the longer-term outlook for stocks is likely to add to market volatility and threaten the “buy-the-dip” mentality that has led investors to see market turbulence as an opportunity to buy more stocks.
1561 2018-03-28 14:26:42 Didn’t you support banning bump stocks and raising minimum purchase age to 21?  Also said something incoherent about taking guns and then providing due process?  But then you met with NRA.  How can anyone be expected to believe anything you say?  Universal Background Checks work.
1562 2018-03-28 14:26:33 Ok, #spanky45 , but you realize no one in the Parkland camp is asking for a repeal of 2A, but a ban on assault rifles, bump stocks, hi cap magazines, and a proper screening process for gun purchase.  Things your founding fathers would have included in 2a had they existed in 1791.

1568 2018-03-28 14:25:35 We are also grappling with rising trade tensions and the impact of higher interest rates. Of course, we have recognize rising pessimism about the outlook for U.S. stocks might not translate into actual market declines.
1569 2018-03-28 14:25:28 It would be wise to sell and move on to other stocks
1570 2018-03-28 14:25:23 Don't get your knickers in a twist. Stevens is an outlier and is stating his opinion. The gun control movement wants age increase, background checks, no gun show loopholes, no bump stocks, and no AR-15s.
1571 2018-03-28 14:25:11 Yes! Bump stocks and AR-15s for everyone. 2nd amendment rights!

1575 2018-03-28 14:23:00 As if tech stocks needed this as well.
1576 2018-03-28 14:22:51 The constitution doesnt give us the unlimited right to all arms. The current admin is banning bump stocks. What will threaten the 2A is if we do nothing. The shootings will get to a point where desperate measures will be taken. Trump himself mentioned bypassing due process.
1577 2018-03-28 14:22:32 At the same time, the percentage of people expecting stocks to fall has risen to 29% after falling below 20% in recent months.
1578 2018-03-28 14:22:18 You have the right to your own opinion, but do you really believe bump stocks, high capacity magazines and assault rifles should be legal? Their only purpose it's killing people. Feel free to shoot at a gun range, but there's absolutely no need to have one in your home.
1579 2018-03-28 14:21:59 Because #stocks clearly are a bubble.
Same pattern housing had: soaring prices - while incomes near-flat and many incomes nil.
1580 2018-03-28 14:21:56 A survey released Tuesday by the Conference Board showed 35% of consumers surveyed expect stocks to rise over the next year, down from 40% last month and marking the lowest level since the November 2016 U.S. presidential election.

1589 2018-03-28 14:19:07 Furthermore, 97% of Americans want these same laws enacted. Red flag law, smaller magazine capacity, bam bump stocks, ban assault rifles, change legal purchase age, etc. Don’t tell me there are thousands of gun laws already and that bad guys don’t follow rules.

1603 2018-03-28 14:14:47 Most of us want stronger gun control legislation not a total elimimination of 2A. Get rid of rapid firing multiple ammunition guns limit ammunition and bump stocks Stricter background checks and severely mentally I'll not in the position to purchase them

repealing the 2A would of course mean less resistance because its taking away peoples rights to own a gun in the first place lol

1614 2018-03-28 14:11:26 MOST citizens just demand SENSIBLE reform. Like thorough background checks on EVERY sale. Ammo only to licensed individuals. Ban most semiautomatic, bump stocks, large capacity mags. Raise age for all sales to 21. 30 day wait.
1615 2018-03-28 14:11:22 Markets from stocks to cryptocurrencies contain a message call the trend.  This message is not defined by fundamentals but rather observations of price, volume, and time.

1618 2018-03-28 14:10:53 "sensible gun laws" is vague. It's like "healthy food choices". All sounds good and is easy to support but isn't specific. What "sensible guns laws" do you want?

I want to outlaw bump stocks and other assessories that mechanically automate & accelerate firing of semi-automatics
1619 2018-03-28 14:10:49 I'd like to see some common sense limitations. Consistent and nor comprehensive background and mental health checks. Maybe a waiting/holdover period. Limits on ammunition and accessories like bump stocks. So I guess yes?

1640 2018-03-28 14:03:52 All firearms are regulated, all of them. Bump stocks aren't regulated because it's a chunk of plastic with no moving parts. Need is an irrelevant argument conserning inanimate objects in a monetary based society. Fix/enhance the FFL POS to eliminate guns in the wrong hands.
1641 2018-03-28 14:03:48 If you are so stupid to think that’s what we are fighting for then what can we expect from your base? We want stricter sensible gun laws, banning certain guns with no loop holes and banning bump stocks and multi round magazines.

1657 2018-03-28 14:00:44 I think that's more than has been done for quite a few years (positive moves only).. and this really needs to happen after the DW era bloat.

1739 2018-03-28 13:35:25 And my argument isn’t actually based on banning all guns. It’s based on restricting certain ones and making it AS HARD AS POSSIBLE for the wrong people to get guns. Then making them less deadly when they do (no bump stocks, kid-safe locks etc).

How about universal background checks which have approval rating of 91% across the board? How about banning bump stocks?  Did you actually listen to their proposals or just react?
1758 2018-03-28 13:27:53 Repealing the 2nd amendment is not moderation. Smart gun laws are:
Banning bump stocks

Restrictions on assault rifles

No sales to mentally ill

Limits on magazine capacity

Safes and trigger locks included with sale and required for liability.

Homes will still be safe.

1772 2018-03-28 13:23:32 Not in enough ways. I don't advocate taking your guns away. The assault rifle ban worked, bring it back, ban bump stocks, make the background check database comprehensive including complete mental health and domestic violence record,, end extended clips add some age restrictions.

1776 2018-03-28 13:22:34 Long story short: background checks and limited stocks for new owners help reduce the risk of gun violence from people with Vincent histories, while hard registries make private sellers accountable. If you oppose these measures, you're probably guilty of at least one of these.
1777 2018-03-28 13:22:18 The #NRA opposes every effort to improve public safety around guns. Limits on magazine capacity, extended Pistol Magazines, folding or telescoping stocks for concealability. The NRA, the mass murderers best friend. Mass Shootings are solvable. It's time we solved them.

1779 2018-03-28 13:20:57 Ban civilian-owned, military-style weapons, bump stocks, have 4 day wait period, background checks, raise buying age to 21. Reasonable to me
1780 2018-03-28 13:20:49 I fully regret my vote for him every single day. He's pandering for the voters on the fence. The 1.3T spending bill with gun control measures in it was final straw. Along with the DOJ classifying bump stocks as Automatic, when in reality they are not.

1790 2018-03-28 13:17:02 Ok, I get bump stocks (but aren’t they already - or soon will be - illegal federally?). What I don’t understand is the rationale for banning civilians from having body armor.
1791 2018-03-28 13:15:44 I don't see Warren Buffett making a major investment in $GE General Electric, not anywhere near current levels. It could happen, but I'm doubtful. I'd like to see GE fall another point or 3, then maybe get in myself. We'll see. #Stocks #retirement
1792 2018-03-28 13:15:34 the deluge of new free cash by changes in the tax law, and historic outperformance of stocks with buybacks vs capex spending means less of a "trickle down" than was thought of when it was passed. 

yes the buybacks may go into forming PE funds, begin private businesses. the govt

1831 2018-03-28 13:06:37 STOCKS:  Stocks are down for1st Qtr.   Wall Street & GOP/PACs do not want stock loss in 1st qtr after Tax Cuts, so they will be buying.

1897 2018-03-28 12:40:21 No but he and Pence have reignited 80s style drug war laws and addiction still isn't treated like a disease... I have a feeling this is something that was in the works previously and he slapped his name on it. Like when stocks are doing well, he bragged. Now, not so much haha
1898 2018-03-28 12:38:50 What do you consider to trade stocks during earnings?
1899 2018-03-28 12:38:18 From an NRA Life Member to those advocating for bump stocks I say, Stop! There is simply no good reason to have bump stocks. We’re not in an armed conflict. Use your efforts for positive efforts like educating people. Most don’t even understand what an assault weapon is 4 example
1900 2018-03-28 12:38:00 um. It is a google search away, Homes...Why not research for yourselves. Half of these folks here don't even know WTH they are talking about and it's so obviouse they never used or owned a gun...I swear the misinformation on bump stocks and "assault" rifles is just insaaaaane....

1903 2018-03-28 12:37:05 No, they don't. They just want to ban ARs and similar guns, bump stocks, and high capacity magazines. These things are quite reasonable, given all the violence that has occurred since 1994.
1904 2018-03-28 12:37:03 Correlation with years of aggressive inflows into passive funds, Tech stocks dominating indexes, and the fact that 70%+ of passive funds hold majority of the same Tech stocks within their top 10 holdings?
1905 2018-03-28 12:36:15 No one is asking to repeal the amendment, you must have gotten that FAKE news from Fox. All taxpayers want waiting periods, background checks, no access to military weapons, ban bump stocks, politicians who aren’t bought and paid for by the NRA and a real President. So...not you.

1910 2018-03-28 12:35:05 Assault weapons & bump stocks are not regulated tools. These weapons are for shooters who like to have "fun" while shooting. Don' t need assault weapons to hunt, for protection. Kids are being hunted like small animals with these weapons.time for change.

1914 2018-03-28 12:34:10 The report has one number measured against a benchmark/index that caps stocks at 10% and one without a capping. With the capped version more than 70% of funds still underperformed during 2017. Without capping NPN, more than 90% of funds underperformed.

1916 2018-03-28 12:33:56 So if stocks go up then it's because the economy is doing great. If they go down it's because of Fed tightening.
1917 2018-03-28 12:32:50 sideways? We`ll see -99% in a few years. 
penny stocks...
1918 2018-03-28 12:32:31 @WitherowMayhew Those tactics go far beyond "disagreeing w their politics." That would be, for instance, stating why they're wrong bump stocks should be banned, rather than falsely claiming they aren't Parkland students & citing sexuality as a pejorative. Those are "attacks"

1922 2018-03-28 12:30:45 They followed the law. The law did not permit them to prohibit them because bump stocks lack moving parts. I do not know how DO I is going to work around the law. NRA will probably sue to stop the ban.
1923 2018-03-28 12:30:39 You already have. Bump stocks
1924 2018-03-28 12:30:31 23.6% of S&P, 3.3% of Dow,  33% of Nasdaq, and 25.6% of NYSE stocks are trading above their respective 50-day Moving Averages
1925 2018-03-28 12:30:30 I own a Beretta for home protection, sorry I don't want to strap it to my hip when I go to the mall... why shouldn't a gun be registered like a car each year? How about the push back on banning bump stocks? what in the world does anyone need that for?

1931 2018-03-28 12:28:25 What a Joke! Republicans are no different than democrats. What good is the second amendment if the government does not respect it? Banning bump stocks, increasing background checks, confiscating guns without due processes is all a violation of shall not be infringed.

1943 2018-03-28 12:25:49 Yes it is. I own guns and have a concealed permit, but I believe we need better control. No assault weapons, no bump stocks, no sales under 21, background checks for every sale, 3 day waiting period and gvnmt buyback.

1951 2018-03-28 12:21:45 Tuesday's closes: TYM8 +14.00, FVM8 +9.00. Jun 10-year T-notes on Tuesday rallied to a 1-1/2 month high and closed higher on the sharp sell-off in stocks and on the weaker-than-expected Mar Richmond Fed manufacturing index and Conference Board Mar U.S. consumer confidence reports
1952 2018-03-28 12:21:03 In this enviroment I am more of a day trader to be honest. I might try to catch an intraday swing and am very willing to realize even small profits quickly. I always keep positions small eod as this chop zone is here to eat you profits alive. #stocks #nasdaq #nyse
1953 2018-03-28 12:20:56 Stocks were also undercut by the unexpected -3.1 point decline in the Conference Board's Mar U.S. consumer confidence to 127.7 (weaker than expectations of +0.2 to 131.0)
1954 2018-03-28 12:20:54 Does it really matter what prompted his murderous rampage? If he hadn't been able to purchase those assault weapons and bump stocks, all those people would still be alive. The evidence that fewer assault weapons results in fewer mass killings is indisputable.
1955 2018-03-28 12:20:24 Tuesday's closes: S&P 500 -1.73%, Dow Jones -1.43%, Nasdaq -3.32%. The S&P 500 on Tuesday closed lower on the sharp decline in technology stocks as further reports emerged on the Trump administration's drive to halt Chinese investment in sensitive U.S. industries.
1956 2018-03-28 12:20:12 According to Eugene Stoner who designed it the weapon was designed as a military grade weapon. And even without bump stocks the weapon is capable of firing up to 45 rounds per minute in semi-automatic mode.

1958 2018-03-28 12:18:44 $AAPL Goldman well behind the curve. AAPL is on a different phase and theme. Plenty of cash, higher divs and buybacks.#stocks
1959 2018-03-28 12:17:39 For the million zillionth time... no one wants to take those guns. It is about bump stocks, semi automatic killing machines, and better registration of gun owners.
1960 2018-03-28 12:16:48 Thanks for the warning. I am coming to Lake District by car in May and while I generally avoid blocking anything, it is not very obvious for a city-dweller like myself that a local road in the fields may be of such importance for shepherds and their stocks.

1971 2018-03-28 12:13:59 Asian stocks settled lower: Japan -1.34%, Hong Kong -2.50%, China -1.40%, Taiwan -1.10%, Australia -0.73%, Singapore -1.64%, South Korea -1.43%, India -0.62%. Asian equity markets followed U.S. markets lower as losses in technology stocks spread across the globe.
1972 2018-03-28 12:13:49 The slide in stocks has benefited government bond markets as flight-to-safety demand has pushed the 10-year German bund yield down to a 2-1/2 month low of 0.473% and pushed the 10-year T-note yield down to a 1-1/2 month low of 2.74%.

1974 2018-03-28 12:13:30 Weakness in energy stocks is another negative for the overall market with May WTI crude oil (CLK18 -0.57%) down -0.67% on concern a global supply glut may persist after API data late Tuesday showed U.S. crude stockpiles rose +5.32 million bbl last week.
1975 2018-03-28 12:13:23 This could be important if the 200-day holds. Likely chasers:
Conference Board showed 35% of consumers surveyed expect stocks to rise over the next year, down from 40% last month.
29% looking for a drop, up form 20%
1976 2018-03-28 12:12:50 Sir first of all  SEBI should instruct market expert like SP tulsian not  to give buy call on these stocks ........... he gave buy call on  videocon, bhushan steel and amtek auto  all three are down  from his  recommendation price
1977 2018-03-28 12:12:12 Jun E-mini S&Ps (ESM18 +0.29%) this morning are up +0.05% and European stocks are down -0.68% as weakness in technology stocks drags down global stock indexes.

1989 2018-03-28 12:09:16 The vast majority of Democrats only want common sense gun laws - like universal background checks and a ban on killing machines like bump stocks. Not too much to ask. Come out from under the NRA’s skirts and do what’s RIGHT for America. #scaredycat #NRAIsATerroristOrganization
1990 2018-03-28 12:09:07 Just more lies. Democrats do not want your guns or mine. Simply want meaningful movement towards removal of military hardware from consuming general population. Large magazines, bump stocks, background check. Nothing more.

1992 2018-03-28 12:08:42 Didn’t we hear one of the Communist speakers at that rally even say, when we give an inch, they’ll take a mile?! That’s why the acquiescing on bump stocks was a HUGE betrayal. As a matter of fact acquiescing on full auto way back when paved the way for this!
1993 2018-03-28 12:07:41 Specific gun control laws have been mentioned over and over including: raising the age, closing gun show loopholes, making background checks more effective, banning military grade weapons, bump stocks, high capacity magazines, and improving access to mental health care.

1998 2018-03-28 12:06:03 Market looking shaky right now imo, might just by some bonds and wait for a beer market to buy stocks at heavy discount
1999 2018-03-28 12:05:57 I’ve initiated short positions after being out of stocks for over a year... focusing instead on crypto. That is how convinced I am we are nearing recession. If a rally ensues, I will short more. CNBC analysts projecting recession is 19 months out, I believe they are wrong.

2002 2018-03-28 11:58:34 Sir is this not the way to promote a brand sir is it? First you provide good specs but at the time of purchase you stick a board of out of stocks so that people are forced to buy it from outside giving much higher price for the same is this ok for you sir that
2003 2018-03-28 11:57:45 There isn’t a correlation with unemployment, but there is one with wages. Companies are buying back billions in stocks then issuing two percent wage increases. This a broken system, hourly employees should at least get shares if these companies are going to buy back stock
2004 2018-03-28 11:55:15 I buy and sell stocks based solely on LBs rants or puppy retweets! Market indicator for sure
2005 2018-03-28 11:54:53 I ain’t tryna be a shareholder of your stocks pussy. Telling everyone “it’s yours”
2006 2018-03-28 11:54:15 Just parked at local woods to walk dog and reassured by two undertakers in the car park that they’re not ‘undertaking, just collecting stocks and supplies’. 
2007 2018-03-28 11:53:54 People who think I haven’t been replying to your messages, I am really sorry. It’s just that my best friends like anjani stocks, Ola, zoomer, floral decor, parathawala, make my trip, blonde saloon etc get jealous to see any other messages. So please mail/whatsapp me instead.
2008 2018-03-28 11:53:19 Sir we provide lots of suggestions to xiaomi too but i think they don't look into it ...sir if xiaomi is saying that they have good amount of stocks when flash sale runs then where all that stocks goes they must have data if customers are interested in your products
2009 2018-03-28 11:52:06 Stocks of the companies referred to NCLT will continue to trade for now but @SEBI_India will take a final call soon.

It's a good thing I haven't actually recorded anything with the Ranekawa switch deck yet

2023 2018-03-28 11:47:01 Kass, you have become an amazing Hindsight trader lately. Do you really think you're fooling people? you see stocks move and then all of sudden you claim to have bought the lows. You did it with SPY and FB this morning. Never seen anyone who lies like you do

2027 2018-03-28 11:44:57 Regulation and the CFP are there because of fish stocks had been grossly overfished. Some stocks to the point of extinction. 

Implementation of eg. quotas by national governments very 'macro-economic' & far from optimal for local communities - in the UK & in more #EU27 MS's
2028 2018-03-28 11:44:52 Dear @FinMinIndia asking LIC of India to buy in stocks of PSU cos IPO is completely absurd. People invest in insurance for capital preservation and future financial expenses, while this money is spent and lost in stock market investments
2029 2018-03-28 11:44:48 Stock market is gambling. My retirement is not in stocks. Especially after 9/11 and I lost a quarter of my retirement account. My account may not grow with stock market, but it didn't crash with it this last month either. I still have my money.
2030 2018-03-28 11:43:34 @awealthofcs great blog post on real returns of bonds over periods of rising rates ( the great reflation) An excellent follow-up would be the real return of stocks and a balanced portfolio over the same period. Did inflation erode those returns as well?
2031 2018-03-28 11:43:32 Stop helping them by doing stupid democrat moves like banning bump stocks! Make national carry federal law Now! Take suppressors of the NFA! Be pro 2nd not just in words but action Mr President!
2032 2018-03-28 11:43:31 Which were your top and worst preforming stocks in FY18?
2033 2018-03-28 11:42:46 Universal background checks; Training, testing, insurance, and registration (a la cars and drivers); limits on magazine sizes; banning bump stocks; limiting gun access by domestic abusers. Last, allow the CDC to study the issue - and provide funding to do it!
2034 2018-03-28 11:42:44 Of course he was. His dad was a carpenter and made nothing but gun stocks, if only someone had made the barrels back then he never would have been crucified.
2035 2018-03-28 11:42:31 They must take our guns in order to gain world government, No guns, no freedom. Wake up liberals, are you all brain dead? This is the intention of creating the 2nd amendment, to protect us from the tyranny of evil governments, NOT for hunting wabbits. We Do need bump stocks!!
2036 2018-03-28 11:42:11 I am always shocked at people who buy stocks or real estate, but never invest in their greatest asset, their mind. Just because you bought a house or two does not make you an expert at real estate.
2037 2018-03-28 11:42:02 Ok +4.7k a tough day all in all traded 13 stocks 3 short 10 long. Was expecting market to really get hammered but it kinda opened then ranged, and likewise with many stocks. But managed an ok day considering the kind of days going lately!

2040 2018-03-28 11:41:04 Trump has sold out his base by signing the budget, banning bump stocks, and cheating on all of his wives, sometimes with porn stars. If I were him, I’d pipe down too.
2041 2018-03-28 11:40:16 No one wants to repeal it idiot.  Just implement laws that change the selling of specific ARs.  Just like you outlawed bump stocks
2042 2018-03-28 11:39:33 Bout time, these stocks have been the best of 2018.  Also can you find out why Jim blocked me? I’m a big fan.

2045 2018-03-28 11:37:00 In the mid-1970’s, US stocks represented 70% of global market capitalization. Today, it is 36%. In 2050, that percentage is anticipated to be 17%. Just a little global perspective.
2046 2018-03-28 11:36:54 I agree stricter laws are needed and ENFORCED, maybe raising age limit, making bump stocks illegal & so on but law abiding citizens need to protect themselves. More focus should be placed on mental illness awareness as the "shooters" all had KNOWN severe mental illness issues.

2052 2018-03-28 11:31:51 Not one of those kids at the March for our Lives rally called for repeal.  All called for sensible gun legislation. Universal background checks, bump stocks should be banned, etc.  this tweet from Trump is him just riling up his base again.

2085 2018-03-28 11:15:43 Sizable mags have been around and never been an issue in the light until now. Along with bump stocks which are few and far between. Be honest have you heard of a bump stock before the Las Vegas shooting? Probably not, few knew and now everyone’s an “expert” in weapons.

2104 2018-03-28 11:04:48 @WhiteHouse @NRA @SenateGOP @HouseGOP   The answer is not to repeal but to COMPROMISE!!!!!!  Do we really need military weapons in the homes of ALL citizens?  What about federal mandated background Checks? Or waiting times? Or bump stocks?

2107 2018-03-28 11:03:48 The problem with current gun laws is that a majority of Americans want stricter laws. Universal background checks, no bump stocks, no high capacity cartridges, assault weapon ban, increase age to 21. Only NRA paid politicians object.

Despite early gains yesterday, US markets finished lower, as the Nasdaq closed down 2.9%. Several factors impacted tech stocks, such as Facebook’s stock being downgraded.
2244 2018-03-28 09:43:53 This is silly for two reasons. First, you have to assume everyone owns stocks, and secondly, you have to assume the market will go up in perpetuity.  But it will not. Trump cannot repeal the business cycle. We are in the ninth year of an expansion, a historically long time.
2245 2018-03-28 09:42:22 You know the overton window has swung off the charts to the right when a staunch conservative like former SCOTUS Justice John Paul Stevens is the radical in the room, calling for the abolition of the Second Amendment, and the rest of us are sitting here arguing about bump stocks.

2271 2018-03-28 09:22:33 Lol..boss I know follow sha..but what exactly explains it.....what sales or exports were made to make the dollar bleed cause last I remembered all stocks for the US were at a GREEN at that same time range. or should we say google was hacked? #JustSaying
2272 2018-03-28 09:21:57 Doing the research is fine, however understanding the research and interpreting it correctly is so very very important, especially in a market lacking liquidity, cream rises to the top as do quality stocks, choose carefully.
2273 2018-03-28 09:21:50 No one really cares about bump stocks nor had anyone much heard of them before Vegas. Just a head fake!
2274 2018-03-28 09:21:38 Sir pls suggest some lobg term secure investment stocks

2276 2018-03-28 09:18:57 After opening the day in red, markets in India have continued the downtrend and are presently trading below the dotted line. Sectoral indices are trading mixed with stocks in the metals sector and stocks in the power sector trading in red.

2278 2018-03-28 09:18:13 @BasGazette We need a day to be proud of, and this should be it.  We need a parade reenacting the fateful day. Our children should be wearing face paint and through sponges at people in the stocks.
2279 2018-03-28 09:18:09 So the FTSE/JSE All Share Index is back below levels of April 2015. Losing money slowly with stocks or losing money quickly with cryptos, your pick.
2280 2018-03-28 09:17:50 Such mid cap stocks will face volatility going ahead 
However the business model continues to be strong 
Just hold on to the stock for 2 years if you want to recover your investment 
Frankly I never like investors lose money on my calls but this is the best advice as of now
2281 2018-03-28 09:17:44 Les stocks US remontent suite a une accalmie des tensions entre la Chine et les USA. Le #bitcoin et les #cryptomonnaies vont-elles rebondir également ?
2282 2018-03-28 09:17:07 @realDonaldTrump what happened!? Finding PP who just a ran tweets targeting children saying they need a princess whose had an abortion, or is an illegal immigrant, etc .? Banning bump stocks, increasing gun control, where's my president! ? Very concerned

2290 2018-03-28 09:07:09 I should go and buy stocks before all the store/markets/supermarkets closes.
2291 2018-03-28 09:05:38 1. Basically shares in passive index funds/basket of stocks
2. As a mining "expert" I was saddened by dreamy hopes of my poorer customers who sold everything back in mid 2017 to buy rigs from me, so forget about it! Worst idea ever. 
3. Have you checked your "free" ETH airdrops?

2295 2018-03-28 09:00:44 @ValueTrapBlog Hey Andrew. Examples of dollar cost averaging, generally explain it in the context of one stock. Good to get your view on building a portfolio with a monthly regular investment of $150. Do you buy 3 stocks one month, three new positions the next or one @ $150.
2296 2018-03-28 09:00:43 the worry should be if stocks will hold the February lows

2298 2018-03-28 08:55:42 @bsoenensvrt net naar podcast geluisterd, bump stocks hebben niets te maken met het herladen van een geweer, maar met de snelheid waarmee je kogels uit dezelfde lader achter elkaar kan afschieten.
2299 2018-03-28 08:55:05 Well well well the stock market is down again, of course another lame excuse- it seems the so- called investors have all but gone into chewing their nails again , oh gee the tech stocks they are all stuffed, everyday in the markets are boo hoo, we need to get over ourselves.

2302 2018-03-28 08:53:20 We're blessed with lots of choice. Special mention to the amazing Daybreak Services in #Packington, an Aladdin's cave. Stocks everything from local meat, fresh veg, fish, plants, hardware, garden accessories. Known locally as Arkwright's, it's always bustling with locals.
2303 2018-03-28 08:53:03 Global stocks deepened their slide as technology shares extended their slide on concerns about increased regulatory oversight of the sector

2305 2018-03-28 08:52:17 Hi Carole, I'd like to buy some penny stocks in Facebook. Can you keep digging until they reach that level, and let me know 
Truly fabulous work, btw
2306 2018-03-28 08:52:06 The problem is we aren't bringing government entities into the public. Grow the business and then let it be sold  to the public through stocks to achieve benefits.

2310 2018-03-28 08:48:01 If you’re planning to start a business, you should consider putting up and online business.

It is one of the easiest to set up as you don’t need a place for your store or stocks.

You just need a computer and a good internet connection and you’re good to go!
2311 2018-03-28 08:47:44 Must have been loads of people caught by #IGG yesterday  (especially the Stoploss Brigade) - the Biggest Error of all is selling Quality Stocks too early and the Market continually tries to scare us out.
2312 2018-03-28 08:47:36 And Bump Stocks & AR15s are still Legal and for sale
2313 2018-03-28 08:47:11 It depends. If the selectors give someone like Tremain an opportunity, then you would have to wait and see what he can do. I am more confident with our bowling depth. While out batting stocks NOW look very skinny.
2314 2018-03-28 08:46:56 The trend is your friend until it ends. A couple of stocks have pierced and closed below 200EMA on daily, some on weekly. It's time to cut losses (and lock some profits), hold on cash until a new trend is clearly defined. Risk Management. Trend Following.
2315 2018-03-28 08:46:49 @shyamsek should I accumulate the existing stocks. But mind wanders for another multibager. Search goes on.What to do. Have around 11 stocks current investment is 3.5 L!
I’m just 4 months into market. Want to induce further 10 Lakh. Don’t wanna miss the opportunity.
2316 2018-03-28 08:46:04 Sorry, let me clarify: stocks and modular components easier to conceal in transport, optics and suppressors more concealment during live fire. Notice I used two different words.

2328 2018-03-28 08:35:16 Interest rates crashed down again so chances are people will go back to stocks because nothing else to do. If rates went way up would be more chance for continued down drops.

2336 2018-03-28 08:26:42 As a fan of tech stocks I looked at this and I agree, the story sounds good, but I couldn't see where the serious revenue growth will come from. Might be a good fit with #GMD and their spare cash if they want to up their profile in e-sports.

2342 2018-03-28 08:22:28 Given the trends I see, tech should become more and more a global phenomenon: Europe must wake up or risk becoming irrelevant (no matter the fate of the EU). I doubt we’ll ever see oil stocks among the most valuable cos out there...
2343 2018-03-28 08:21:46 London stocks fell in early trade on Wednesday, taking their cue from a selloff on Wall Street led by the technology sector.
2344 2018-03-28 08:21:43 How abt we don't have guns which can mow down 100 kids in a few mins (at the most)? How abt banning bump stocks?

2346 2018-03-28 08:18:45 And they also had access to the type of weopon, that could kill massive numbers in a matter of minutes. The Las Vegas shooter even had bump stocks on his semi automatics. BTW, people around the world have mental illnesses but you don't see carnage like this..

2348 2018-03-28 08:17:52 Well you are in the shadow of @DLoesch who lied and said #NRA did not lobby. They lobbied against legislation to ban bump stocks, enforce comprehensive background checks, enforce stringent red flag laws, and to put longer wait periods in place.

2354 2018-03-28 08:14:32 Why are you so uneducated?? Obama was blocked from prohibiting bump stocks! He never approved them. You should check before you tweet. Or are you so insecure, that you need to blame others for your own weakness.

2432 2018-03-28 07:25:07 Correlations do change. A great study case to observe that is the correlation between stocks & bonds. 

Long run one could argue for both + and - correlation. Rationale for +: investors have more disposable income. Rationale for -: bitcoin becomes a risk off asset like gold.

2611 2018-03-28 05:18:30 Nailed it. ICO's (penny stocks with millennial characteristics) drove the big bitcoin demand in Dec. Can't purchase ICO's with cash. ICO purchases require the use of bitcoin or some other crypto currency. Now that SEC is bearing down on ICO's, bitcoin has nowhere to go but down.
2612 2018-03-28 05:17:50 The Parkland students are not asking 2 do away with the Second Amendment, just asking 4 responsible people to act responsibly!

2619 2018-03-28 05:15:00 The quota should not be sold knowing Wales has no fishing boats. There should be other boats from within UK given option to fish and if not used then fish stocks can be built up. Dutch trawling boat has a deal with English quota. That should end when UK is no longer part of CFP.

2656 2018-03-28 04:48:20 The word "Trader" is a highly polished anglicized version of word "Dallal". They reaped the benefits of Modi govt reformist measures and high yielding stocks all these years, now to criticize and derogate him. #Nifty #banknifty
2657 2018-03-28 04:48:12 you and every woman like you are the reason they are going after grip handles & adjustable stocks. Things that make a standard rifle more flexible to meet both a large male & small female requirements, giving comfort & ease of use to the operator of the gun.
2658 2018-03-28 04:47:58 You mean like Obama made bump stocks legal? Do you know what a assault weapon is..? You most definitely don’t respect our constitution! Trump ended Obama’s unconstitutional executive order. Just because you’re on SS doesn’t mean you’re mentally ill.

2729 2018-03-28 03:58:01 I assume this spells more downside for the JSE today. Some stocks have already been hit hard; you just wonder how close we are to the bottom and when buying opportunities exist.

2733 2018-03-28 03:55:11 Despite being in several businesses I've never actually bought stocks (still don't have any), can you believe it? LOL I know there are specialized sites and portals but I'd recommend going with a fund manager. Most retail banks now have at least consulting services for this.
2734 2018-03-28 03:54:01 Pay per trade usually. If you go through a broker they can do the trades for you, and they will advise you on what stocks are right for your risk tolerance/appetite. But they charge pretty stepps fees + comission. @BTS_twt most firms also have a min deposit size...
2735 2018-03-28 03:53:54 You want to know what you kids accomplished thus far?

2744 2018-03-28 03:47:54 Nope, just saying that a dozen AR-15s, fitted out with bump stocks, wouldn't stop you from being blown to smithereens.  Now do you see what a stupid argument "I need protection from the government" is?

2748 2018-03-28 03:45:38 Some stocks (mostly thematic) are buy even at P/E multiples of more than 50-70-90. Is P/E even a right parameter to assess valuation of such stocks?

2780 2018-03-28 03:28:53 I buy stocks and ETF’s based on their individual charts/price action regardless what the major indexes are doing, just being much more defensive and cautious in a down market. If/when $SPY starts trading below the 200d, I’ll be net short.

2782 2018-03-28 03:28:38 You cant put 16 million into a combo of stocks tbills and bonds that make you 6% a yr.  6% on 16 mil is 960,000 without touching the principal. These dudes are silly
2783 2018-03-28 03:28:00 Imma be real, all I remember about that set is that both my wins were two stocks. I take what I can get
2784 2018-03-28 03:27:42 I guess you don’t you remember the story about the loaves and the fishes and the semi-automatics? Jesus multiplied seven loaves of bread, a few fish, an AR-15, and a couple of rifles with bump stocks, and he was able to feed and arm over 5000 followers.
2785 2018-03-28 03:27:14 U.S. stocks already are coming off the biggest weekly decline in more than two years, and the aftermath of that drop has market technicians warning that major indexes are on the verge of a full-fledged, technical breakdown.

2796 2018-03-28 03:19:07 Time to take bump stocks completely off the market. Public citizens are not military and have no business with them.

2801 2018-03-28 03:15:29 Just my opinion but people and institutions that like to invest in social media will look for the best alternative within that space. Twitter $twtr seems to have less privacy issues. Short run I think both go down but Twitter will have quicker and stronger bounce back. #stocks

2804 2018-03-28 03:13:41 Let's ask Republicans if they support universal background checks, ban on assault weapons, ban on bump stocks, ban on NRA transferring funds from foreign entities to lobbying arm, red flag laws and a ban on large mags.

2809 2018-03-28 03:10:31 So you trade the bullshit as best as you can. Until one day the bullshit won’t stick no more, you short. 

Stocks are built on belief. A belief can be based on truth or a lie. In stocks, it’s mostly lies.
2810 2018-03-28 03:10:20 watch for #copper stocks---might head to a load up level!
2811 2018-03-28 03:09:43 Lemme tell you something about how i trade stocks. I don’t believe anything morons say. I look at numbers and price movement.  People lie. Executives lie. Even the financials can be cooked.
2812 2018-03-28 03:09:00 When do you think that happens
2813 2018-03-28 03:08:45 Bodal Chemicals (116) and Avanti Feeds (2194) complete expansion of additional facilities, and Bhansali Engg. (167) finally pays up the dues. Good green today for these stocks?
2814 2018-03-28 03:08:12 I presume that having the ability to purchase 55 firearms and 100 firearm related accessories, like bump stocks, within a year’s time is “common sense” #LasVegasMassShooter
2815 2018-03-28 03:07:34 You really think dollar land
2816 2018-03-28 03:06:56 @DaveHcontrarian An interesting thought for anyone bearish--what has more upside from here over the next year or two--long ZROZ, or short stocks (IWM, MS, CAT, etc.)? Certainly, the former is easier to live with, has positive carry and less volatile. Didn't work in Feb though.
2817 2018-03-28 03:06:53 Only if big market sharks let us buy the stocks since bighit has proved that they are gold laying chickens. And I can predict their stocks price is as costly as their concert tickets. Hope bighit allow quarter stocks reserved only armys to buy. @BTS_twt
2818 2018-03-28 03:06:20 Nobody huh? Did you hear retired Justice John Stevens remarks today? Also students at the March, one saying specifically she wanted to start small with bump stocks and then go all the way to taking all arms away from citizens.
2819 2018-03-28 03:05:49 So Wall ST. is full of good people , no scammers ,no spoofers ,no wash traders  no bad people. And there is no Euphoria in stocks like Facebook
2820 2018-03-28 03:05:47 STOCKS TO WATCH Reliance Industries to sell select Eagle Ford shale assets in U.S. for $100 million.
2821 2018-03-28 03:05:39 Not exactly sure what you mean by the needs of the few. The majority of Americans actually want gun reform. REFORM, not repelling the Second Amendment. More thorough Back ground checks, ban on high powered assault weapons, ban on bump stocks, and ban on high capacity magazines.
2822 2018-03-28 03:04:33 and likely the biggest winner will be silver..silver mining stocks doing better still.
2823 2018-03-28 03:04:10 And outlaw bump stocks and large capacity magazines.
2824 2018-03-28 03:03:24 Don't be surprise as part of Facebook "self audit" that they don't hire McCabe or Comey or both to do an honest evaluation of their "UNbiased policies." Remember this guy sold stocks of Facebook when the writing was on the wall.
2825 2018-03-28 03:03:03 Today provides a great example. There was really no explanation for the wide swing from positive to negative for the vast majority of stocks. Can’t imagine they were efficiently priced in the morning and in the afternoon at very different levels.

2828 2018-03-28 03:01:42 @realDonaldTrump Listen 2 your base dont go after bump stocks. Don't give away 2nd Amendment Rights it will not put you in the history books as a Great President.
2829 2018-03-28 02:59:43 The 2nd Amendment was written when the government and the people had the same weapons. The Constitution and Amendments change with society and technology. Give me one good reason why civilians need semi-automatic rifles and bump stocks.

2835 2018-03-28 02:54:00 “The main thing people feared at that time was Saddam Hussein’s chemical weapons stocks,” Bolton said in 2009, defending the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
2836 2018-03-28 02:52:19 Also I know guns don't kill people. Most of us want to increase difficulty of purchase and ban modifiers like bump stocks. At most ban the AR 15 which is the deadliest gun a civilian can buy and literally has no other purpose in society.

2850 2018-03-28 02:44:54 Market III: Amid a change in IBD current outlook today, possible scenarios going forward: 1) More market, #economic shocks, #nasdaq takes out Feb 9 low of 6630, or a new, deeper correction; 2) rangebound, 6500 to 7500; or 3) #stocks regroup, new highs again #trading #investing

None of the above have ever been arrested. 
2853 2018-03-28 02:43:35 I think Etrade online will let you buy the stocks directly from Kosdaq. (I think BigHit will be listed with Kosdaq since that's where SM is traded) There's a minimum of 500 to open an account though.
2854 2018-03-28 02:43:32 Facebook has suffered financial hits (stocks and Mark himself) because of this situation and they've been playing damage control since. Different times, but to say this won't hurt FB? or even give way to a new social media platform?

2856 2018-03-28 02:42:31 Agree with Williams Schryver - need equities to tank so retail motivated to reallocate to different asset class.  As gold miners beat low-ball estimates this year, gminers will begin to look attractive to momentum crowd who will be looking for high earnings growth stocks to chase

2858 2018-03-28 02:41:43 most want to keep the 2nd Amendment. Those bashing the kids who marched on Saturday don't want you to believe that. Most of us DO want universal background checks, no bump stocks and NO MORE semi automatic killing machines.

2863 2018-03-28 02:37:37 For marijuana stocks, do you think that is a buy or sell signal?
2864 2018-03-28 02:37:21 The problem is, the slope becomes very slippery. I want to say, i dont use bump stocks. But the left is on a very familiar path and i think the big fear is that when they have taken the guns, we wont be able to defend our other rights.
2865 2018-03-28 02:36:46 There's a place in Roanoke, Texas 10 minutes away from me that stocks it, and another in Lewisville, Texas 15 minutes away....

2874 2018-03-28 02:32:49 Yes very true invest in Thirumalai,Dmart,Mgl,Igl are some stocks with Marico vmart such consumption stocks so returns will be far better in long term
2875 2018-03-28 02:31:57 The similarity is, Tortoise tends to do very well in markets, hares get slaughtered.
Hares discuss stocks on twitter using . When markets fall, they get trapped first.
If you are in hurry to make returns in the market, you will not get it.
2876 2018-03-28 02:31:35 The 2nd Amended should stand as is.  The only additions should be based upon technological changes, that is: an ABM missile didn’t exist at the time of writing the 2nd amendment & isn’t considered part of the 2nd amendment as well as bump stocks or AR15 or AK47 shouldn’t be.
2877 2018-03-28 02:30:53 Despite a huge geopolitical announcement today of North Korea reportedly agreeing to denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, we have a jittery global market with Asia following the US stocks downwards.
2878 2018-03-28 02:29:42 No need to do anything just need to hold all stocks as it is with patience. Market will new high within next one year and your portfolio will recover very quickly. In fact it is very good opportunity to add the stocks at low price and increase the allocation

2880 2018-03-28 02:29:10 $SOCL Social media ETF after a big run up since 2106 has closed for the 1st time below the 10 wma in big volume - sell signal for the component stocks?
2881 2018-03-28 02:28:51 The way the US markets started in the green and then fell on Tech sector stocks’ steep decline shows why we have been warning traders that high volatility is back and technical indicators may not be effective in such an environment.Time to wait.
2882 2018-03-28 02:28:00 It doesn't actually cost *that* much. I've cashed the stocks bought in my name at birth, etc.
2883 2018-03-28 02:26:25 How did I end up in this “interesting” position that I’m in with $AAPL, $TSLA, & TWTR? Lol!

2885 2018-03-28 02:25:00 If the stock is available within 10% from suggested price then you can increase the quantity of existing stocks up to 10 to 20%. You can continue to invest on monthly basis and consolidate your portfolio once in 2 -3 years

2887 2018-03-28 02:24:22 Hahahahaha. Bump stocks are a toy. Due process is protected by the Constitution. Just like 2nd Amendment and 1st Amendment are protected. 2nd Amendment is in the Bill of Rights not the Bill of Needs.
2888 2018-03-28 02:23:11 Stocks are to hold for 30+ years anyway.

2889 2018-03-28 02:22:03 Tell you what, why don't we get the stocks out and start throwing rotten f&v at them or maybe tar and feather them and run them out of town. The comments are getting uglier than the event.
2890 2018-03-28 02:21:29 Ban bump stocks, mandatory background checks for criminal record , wait periods. No military grade weaponry. Mental health cleanse
2891 2018-03-28 02:19:47 @Gavin_McInnes strap-ons are the bump stocks of the rape world. I suggest we ban them also
2892 2018-03-28 02:19:25 "In general, the upward momentum in stocks is broken," said Maris Ogg, president at Tower Bridge Advisors. "It had to break. You weren't going to go up in a straight line forever."
2893 2018-03-28 02:19:13 The people who invest in crypto mostly do not invest in stocks. The reason they believe in investing in crypto is that they do not believe in investing in stocks
2894 2018-03-28 02:18:50 Ugh same. So long as you have a legit broker, anyone can buy stocks. You just need to prepare the required documents. I’m also waiting for this as I’m planning to buy even a small portion of it. You have to have your own lawyer as well, I guess?
2895 2018-03-28 02:18:32 $DBX came public 3 sessions ago and moved up as much as 50% on its opening day, estimate for '19 is 53% after big expected jump in '18, solid rev growth, + its business is the steady-eddy type that growth-mandated institutions dream about. Let's watch for its 1st pattern #stocks

2898 2018-03-28 02:17:21 I am for gun violence restraining orders, banning bump stocks and I am especially for making sure the laws on the books are enforced efficiently and effectively.
2899 2018-03-28 02:17:07 It was a march to repeal gun control above all else. Tired of wasting time on pretending like bump stocks matter when Nazis are proliferating ideology at an alarming rate. Free speech must be controlled and this isn't possible while populace is armed ☭
2900 2018-03-28 02:17:06 Common sense gun laws, universal background checks. Ban bump stocks. Elect politicians who will put these plans into law regardless of party
2901 2018-03-28 02:15:39 I'm sure you hear this a lot, but I think you should invest in penny stocks to treat your cancer
2902 2018-03-28 02:14:55 That isn’t my opinion. That is a fact. That’s why bump stocks are approved. It is also why they will not be banned by changing the regulation. The change must come from Congress passing new legislation. They may try to ban them by amending the regulation but it won’t stick.
2903 2018-03-28 02:13:31 .@BarackObama sold more guns than many Presidents combined. No boogeyman man to scare up sales. After the defeat of HRC, gun stocks dropped 
#reiders
2904 2018-03-28 02:11:52 Please read the definition of a machine gun according to the NFA of 34. You aren’t an ignorant person. The reason why the ATF allowed bump stocks in the first place is because they didn’t meet the definition of a MG according to the current law definition.
2905 2018-03-28 02:11:41 Last 1,5 years i met a lot of such guys like in this article who things that buying ang keeping #FAANG stocks as a long term investment, is graet idea. Before #dot-com bubble burst, whole world believed so...
2906 2018-03-28 02:11:41 i don’t kare, we keeping bump stocks
2907 2018-03-28 02:11:18 @seanhannity Sir, there are no civilian rifles for sale to public as ASSULT RIFLES.There are rifles with wooden stocks and synthetic stocks. Latter is lighter and more durable. My Son removed fine wooden stock and put on a plastic stock to preserve wood from damage rough use.
2908 2018-03-28 02:11:00 My view would stay same of basking in success glory and allowing expiry to sail through. No need for compulsive directional positions at present.

-no assault rifles if under 21
-ban bump stocks
-stricter registratn chks w respect to ppl w DV, MH issues
-if u cant fly, u cant buy

2911 2018-03-28 02:09:00 All three! Just started with Abra and only using @RobinhoodApp for traditional stocks since they won't sell me any LTC!
2912 2018-03-28 02:08:14 F&O Ban stocks for 28-3-2018:

    In ban: Balrampur Chini, GMR Infra, IFCI, JP Associates.

    New in ban: Balrampur Chini, GMR Infra.

    Out of ban: Jet Airways, Oriental Bank.
2913 2018-03-28 02:07:59 At this time, it would be - one pair per customer.
2914 2018-03-28 02:07:58 It is not possible for there to be a debate with people who are so stupid they buy the NRA’s allegations that amending the gun laws is a violation of the 2nd A. Raising the age, banning bump stocks,  and banning assault weapons in no way violates our right to own guns. Read it!
2915 2018-03-28 02:07:37 "you will need atleast 20 shock arrows"

me, and my stupid ass aiming skills: *stocks up to 55 shock arrows instead*
2916 2018-03-28 02:06:11 Not long!! Gotta get em while stocks last 
2917 2018-03-28 02:06:08 How easy is it to define unearned wealth? If I put my money in a bank account or stocks and shares ISA (or my pension fund), is that 'unearned'? Should the state also take this on my death?
2918 2018-03-28 02:05:55 Yeah, I'm sure the Founding Fathers would have banned "scary black plastic rifle stocks" if they could have foreseen the development of plastics.
2919 2018-03-28 02:05:38 BTC did 10x over 18 months. On a different note any view on stocks?  I remember at some point in time when you had a view that was balanced and useful.
2920 2018-03-28 02:05:22 yep i sold all stocks in 2015
and bought the most expensive inv /property in 2015 in my SMSF with biggest NAB loan (just before they stopped lending for SMSFs)  i could get -its gone up 30% on buy price/ 80% on my deposit in under 3 yrs

2921 2018-03-28 02:05:10 Correct the day before the March the Justice depth was "possibly considering" banning bump stocks. Consider the timing...the day before the March
2922 2018-03-28 02:03:41 And this helps the working poor that can't afford decent housing while working 40 hours a week, how?  They can barely afford food, much less stocks.
2923 2018-03-28 02:02:51 Lower taxes, supreme court, border security with lower immigrants, more jobs, stocks moving, military stronger, incomes up, .......

2927 2018-03-28 02:01:37 Does your 19 yr old know Florida changed laws to age 21, 3 day wait, banned bump stocks, confiscate from anyone who is deemed danger, 500 million to school safety? and President signed law to ban bump stocks, extensive backround checks 3.6 Billion to school safety programs?
2928 2018-03-28 02:00:44 120 seems realistic, as does 210 on the SPY, but the overweight in the large-cap momentum stocks, FANGs, MSFT, etc. may have created an over-weighted market on the upside, and a similar experience on the downside.
2929 2018-03-28 02:00:43 This is a perfect market to begin trading options! I would recommend picking your favorite stocks and begin BUYING puts and calls. Please reach out for free advice! Very simple to make big moves for just a few hundred dollars.
I would be happy to walk through
2930 2018-03-28 01:59:43 I need my wholesome white man at work discussing stocks & shit 
2931 2018-03-28 01:59:30 So they’re done forever? NVDA is a terrible company?  Didn’t hear this when everything was wonderful in January. These stocks DESPERATELY needed a consolidation and move sideways to digest gains and EPS, to see if growth can really continue. I believe it will.
2932 2018-03-28 01:59:14 you probably werent listening when they cheered Biden & Booed McConnell,or hung up on Pres Trump! Even though the Republican Governor of Florida acted swiftly & changed laws to 3day wait,age 21,confiscate guns from people considered a danger,they banned bump stocks,500M to school
2933 2018-03-28 01:57:25 Gun groups challenge Justice Department’s authority to ban bump stocks-logic would seem to call for support of the ban. Trouble is: ‘once the camel gets its nose under the tent, won’t be long till the whole camel’s inside!’@washtimes
2934 2018-03-28 01:56:42 3rd Q at #WA7 Town hall, "can you explain the technical differences between a semi-auto and full auto gun?" A: We had testimony in the Judiciary regarding the bump stocks etc. @RepJayapal recalls shooting an AR15 at #waleg shootout, having good aim, cuz its too easy to shoot.

2939 2018-03-28 01:54:17 Yes, but my timing was off, just before the 10% sell off in stocks
2940 2018-03-28 01:52:45 Shout out to this little hood girl making money moves through investing and stocks.
2941 2018-03-28 01:52:39 what about the dealer who sold him the rifle & why isn’t there a 15 day waiting list to purchase a weapon, why isn’t there a law to ban Bump stocks or why does the NRA fight against any proposed legislation to mitigate mass shootings there is a lot of blame to go around.
2942 2018-03-28 01:49:58 I saw that social media stocks went down today. Maybe their bubble will burst to further expose their interference and bias nature.
2943 2018-03-28 01:49:58 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS U need to be a good president 4 all 1) Don't Twitter it causes divisions among us 2) Tax law is bad as gives more $ to wealthy & creates deficits, 3) Initiate uniform background checks with 7 day wait &eliminate auto weapons & bump stocks,
2944 2018-03-28 01:49:44 PS I’m originally a property developer lol - Got into stocks 2 years ago and have made more than I could’ve imagined, with a lot more liquidity!
2945 2018-03-28 01:49:18 Does #Hodl apply to $FANG stocks as well? #HodlGang
2946 2018-03-28 01:49:12 Lol this is like saying ‘Aussie property’ vs. ‘Sydney or Perth’. Totally different if you buy the right stocks. And what about dividends? You don’t need capital growth if you bought Big 4 Bank shares in 2016-17, got a net return of 7-8% in dividends (100% franked), and then dump
2947 2018-03-28 01:48:47 ALERT:

2949 2018-03-28 01:48:23 Always tough to manage a big fund in India. The depth is missing beyond the top 200-300 stocks. Even taking out 20-30L from a 200cr mkt cap stock will move the price or u simply don't find takers!
2950 2018-03-28 01:48:18 Take it as partial.list as if I change parameters a bit some more stocks will get added or they can appear in list after few weeks of move

2952 2018-03-28 01:45:56 In the interim, what about the stock market? I've lost 95% in 20 different stocks in my entire portfolio on 3/27/18. Also, US Cos. use China as cheap labor to save money. Will they employ Americans at higher wages and still make money, or are they plain greedy, and prefer China??

2956 2018-03-28 01:44:34 I think that date is only accurate on individual stocks, not indexes.
2957 2018-03-28 01:43:16 There's a higher likelihood of dying from boredom today while watching the #psei, than finding any meaningful movement in the stocks.
2958 2018-03-28 01:43:15 Like I said, repeal the second first and the first second.  That will eliminate all triggers,  bump stocks, handguns. silencers, shotguns or anything else that might harm humanity or any living thing.

2962 2018-03-28 01:40:44 VRA Portfolio combines my top growth stocks/story stocks (Know these co's & their mgt like the back of my hand) along with leveraged ETF's that I only employ when they've reached "extreme buy" on VRA System. At 100% cash now. No broad mkt positions. I expect that to change, soon.
2963 2018-03-28 01:40:28 Yes, It sure is tough to trade. The difference b/w indian & us mkts is that while FANG type of stocks showing record profits, our profits are nowhere near highs. 
Nasdaq took the biggest pounding yday.

2966 2018-03-28 01:38:24 Next time you see a kid buying Jordan’s don’t tell him he should save his money or he should buy stocks, let him /her know that they can be a part of that experience and get paid for it
2967 2018-03-28 01:38:22  We are sure candle stocks went up with all the velitas being lit asking for a SEASON 3! We can't get enough of this show.
2968 2018-03-28 01:36:21 -20% as the definition of a bear market doesn't make sense. It's useless.
In a bear market, stocks behave differently. That's what make a bear market. How to spot one? It's the name of the game.
2969 2018-03-28 01:35:35 String Theory says- call/write your representatives, demand sensible gun control. AR ban, mandatory background checks, 21 yrs of age to purchase, ban bump stocks. Its just common sense, folks! All amendments have limitations, the 2nd is no exception.

2971 2018-03-28 01:34:09 Doesn't mean Gold is going up... Stocks could be going down!
2972 2018-03-28 01:33:21 1/26/2018   DOW is at 26,201

2973 2018-03-28 01:33:11 But the tax cuts and repatriated cash. How could these stocks go down
2974 2018-03-28 01:32:16 I'm surprised he even knows what it means when stocks are up or down.
2975 2018-03-28 01:31:56 If Congress is unwilling pass a bill banning bump stocks, what makes anyone think that they would be willing to pass a Constitutional Amendment repealing the 2nd Amendment that would then have to be ratified by 3/4 of the States? #RepealTheSecondAmendment
2976 2018-03-28 01:31:45 Things change derp hence the lead being ok and now we know thats not so much the case, bump stocks weren't written into the constitution so does that mean we need them? We gave woman rights nothing about that in the constitution, point is things change.
2977 2018-03-28 01:31:17 Agree- doubts are there stocks getting hammered- the crooked part is that the debacle is so fake, such a which hunt
2978 2018-03-28 01:30:55 Repub should be asked - Do you support gun control measures like universal background checks, limits on Magazine capacity, ban on bump stocks and military style assault rifles, raising age limit to 21. Every Dem that says yes to ur question and no to mine should be voted out.
2979 2018-03-28 01:30:34 Despite growth leaders holding up decently, Nasdaq/smallcaps may be hard-pressed to simply have an FTD and a meaningful new leg up without help from S&P and larger issues, i.e. an end to the divergence #stocks
2980 2018-03-28 01:29:54 2 of the top 10 #Earnings League #stocks reported today: $MKC (before market open) which started up strong before trailing off (perhaps thanks to overall market forces falling) and $SONC (after hours) which missed earnings and is headed down going into tomorrow. #EpicStockTrading
2981 2018-03-28 01:28:29 Watching the FANG (Tech) stocks get whacked may have a silver lining in that they may become a little more circumspect in handling our personal info as they run the mounting risk the feds voice a need to provide some degree of oversight...
2982 2018-03-28 01:28:21 Undecided short term. Stocks are back to their August 2017 levels, which indicates speculators are in charge of the market. 

Long term, NBCC is a multibagger

2985 2018-03-28 01:25:01 Thanks for the tweet. Actually, this is the second step...Bump stocks were first.
2986 2018-03-28 01:23:01 Marco,  Pay attention to Florida, to the young people and the people of the nation who are calling for gun control.....NOT a gun ban as you falsely claim.   Ban assault weapons, improve background checks,  ban bump stocks.  Protect our children, not the NRA.
2987 2018-03-28 01:22:02 Mr. Holder lost his credibility long ago, certified Bump Stocks legal, fast & furious leading to the death of a federal agent, etc. The only place he coild get a job was with the Libnuts in California.
2988 2018-03-28 01:21:51 Mommy, mommy, ...that's the guy who allowed bump stocks.

2991 2018-03-28 01:20:21 What platform do you trade stocks on?
2992 2018-03-28 01:18:34 I know. That’s why I mentioned it. I’m not a conspiracy theorist either lol The market has come off quite a bit from highs but knowing that it just feels wrong to buy stocks here even if it works.
2993 2018-03-28 01:18:24 Mr. President, keep in mind that Obama didn't made the BUMP STOCKS illegal, because he sworn to uphold the constitution. Meaning that no measures should be use to amend the second amendment. It shall not be INFRINGED!
2994 2018-03-28 01:17:47 STOP!! NOBODY wants to take your guns - what is demanded is stricter regulations, NO bump stocks, NO mega capacity magazines, NO assault weapons. Maybe we need to ask why you want an automatic assault weapon?

3003 2018-03-28 01:12:11 Funny thing is, my father's a Vet, longtime major supporter of @NRA & he actually has no problem w/ the proposals being made.
Comprehensive background checks, no assault style weapons sold to civilians & no bump stocks.
No legal, responsible owner should have problems w/ that.

3006 2018-03-28 01:10:38 LOL, c'mon man. Nobody said they are coming to take away guns from people in their homes. Sensible gun laws such as no rapid fire bullet magazines, no bump stocks, no sales at gun shows & stricter background checks (I think at police depts...instant background check).

3014 2018-03-28 01:08:43 Remember the last time stocks fell so hard? You probably don’t, and that’s making it all seem a little harsher than it is.

3017 2018-03-28 01:07:28 That is correct at least not for right now it will start off with a few gun laws than a lot than next thing you know they will completely take them away and our right to defend ourselves. I'm ok with teaching people safety and taking bump stocks away but that's all.

3027 2018-03-28 01:03:46 True story. Bump stocks and extended magazines are proof.

3048 2018-03-28 00:51:33 Do you understand the correlation matrix for stocks, bonds, and gold? My point is that crypto looks to correlate with stocks, not gold. That has portfolio implications.
3049 2018-03-28 00:50:25 In the year 2000 bubble , Yahoo stock was worth more than the entire country of New Zealand. Now in the 2018 bubble, all the stocks, bonds & real estate in New Zealand is in a bubble.
3050 2018-03-28 00:50:14 Trump, the ban on bump stocks is unconstitutional! I will own bump stocks regardless of what law you try to impose on us.
3051 2018-03-28 00:49:56 Penny stocks and Jr markets are quite common in other territories right?
It's a pretty normal mundane scenario no? @rtrowe
3052 2018-03-28 00:49:49 You can look at a) if there are mutual funds covering bighit stocks once they go public b) contacting your brokerage to see if they offer international services (local option) or c) set up an account directly in Korea to buy from there
3053 2018-03-28 00:49:16 Sure seems to be correlated with stocks, risk on, and liquidity.
3054 2018-03-28 00:49:12 It's private and public, it's controlled by congress, and any profit it makes goes to the U.S. treasury. Then banks hold stocks in it, and elect members to the board to control the money supply, but the banks don't make money off it.
3055 2018-03-28 00:48:13 I would reassess the 2nd ONLY to codify the NATIONAL EXCLUSION (ban) of assault rifles, accessories such as bump stocks, high capacity magazines or clips, silencers, armor piercing ammo or other items that allow guns to kill ppl end masse.  #BanAssaultWeapons #GunSenseNow
3056 2018-03-28 00:47:51 I love guys who fall in love with stocks - especially when they haven’t even started trading. Can you imagine falling in love with  a stock that hasn’t even started to trade- inconceivable. How long you been trading for -couple years is my guess. Get out of the deep end chip.
3057 2018-03-28 00:46:53 Exactly. They buy short shares , release a bullshit report stocks fall they make a profit. And eventually stock recovers and continues to grow
3058 2018-03-28 00:46:24 If your family gets massacred in a mass shooting dont cry. Because your crying might sound too Left Wing. Sensible and responsible gun laws are needed. I'm a gun owner and I know that. I guess you want another Vegas to happen or worse. 2A doesnt cover bump stocks & 100rd drums.

Not a full on retreat.
3062 2018-03-28 00:44:35 Asia stocks open lower as the region follows suit from the tech-led slide on Wall St and as trade concerns continue to linger.
3063 2018-03-28 00:44:03 Oh that’s just hyperbolic. It’s not even practical. No gun owner would want such a thing to tear up their gun. About as logical as bump stocks.
3064 2018-03-28 00:43:33 Overall #StockMarket daily moves mean NOTHING--not big #news. That "spin" is for #sociopaths. Now #SocialMedia (e.g. #Facebook) stocks have real--not #speculative--problem: Make LOT of money on SELLING #data/"targeting".
3065 2018-03-28 00:43:24 I got my friends researching stocks and bonds.
3066 2018-03-28 00:43:04 You tweet fake news. Blaming Obama for bump stocks is fake news; you reversed the gun regulations that would have made it harder for idiots like the recent shooting from being able to buy guns. You are responsible for the death of these students. Instead of blaming take action.
3067 2018-03-28 00:42:56 Bump stocks aint shit! All banning them is is throwing the anti gun idiots a bone ! You can have the same exact action take place by doing nothing more than keeping your trigger finger rigid and letting the gun go back and forth with each recoil !  IT AINT THE GUN FOLKS ! LOL
3068 2018-03-28 00:42:43 Studies have proven that trump would have been wealthier if he had invested in stocks, instead of risky schemes that went belly up. He could have been golfing his entire life if he wasn’t trying to be Mr Big Ego and focusing on revenge.

3071 2018-03-28 00:42:00 While he said this, he was shorting European stocks. Cards close to the chest.
3072 2018-03-28 00:41:57 How about ban the dangerous legal weapons all together. I don't think bump stocks are the real issue here, I think he issue is how easy it is for people to access such dangerous weapons. But other than that, good job I guess?
3073 2018-03-28 00:41:04 He was using a bump fire stock. It mimics a fully automatic weapon. I'm in favor of banning those bump stocks.
3074 2018-03-28 00:40:35 I tried to talk to them once before using the Chat online option. They just directed me to the link "Pricing and other fees".I could understand that there is a flat $5 per trade option (stocks). But I could not confirm whether there were any other charges that will be incurred.
3075 2018-03-28 00:40:18 So true. I can legit name 75 stocks of my head that are down 50% or more ytd

3078 2018-03-28 00:37:58 Most of the stocks are recommended on BO's when its love at first sight! It is always ideal to enter on retracement for investments when CCI 8 Dly < -100 when concurrently CCI 34 Dly > Zero. We do tend to not have patience to wait to factually have a good RR on paper.
3079 2018-03-28 00:37:29 Corn:Was due to follow through following yesterday's negative reversal. Did move lower early today, but overall, little change. Traders prepare for acreage/stocks report Thur.
3080 2018-03-28 00:37:14 On the whole active bond buyers/sellers are more sophisticated/cynical than equity buyers. 

Equity guys can seem smart when stories spread. 

Smart bond guys look thru cash flows. 

Bonds can sometimes see what's coming before stocks
3081 2018-03-28 00:36:27 y’all i really just had a very serious talk with my dad about buying stocks and he said if i do my research and if bighit goes public he might let me invest 100 dollars to see what happens. im so fucking skcnwksn
3082 2018-03-28 00:36:25 That’s good . I work 66hr average to make 150k , mainly trade my 401k account. Almost bought 200k fusz at .12 I’m jam but bought only 5k after buying something else. Then only day trades it for 15k profits. Should of made 400k on it though as it hit 2.10 so going heavy on tops!
3083 2018-03-28 00:34:40 @realDonaldTrump Last Friday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions -- acting in accordance with President Trump’s wishes -- caved to the gun grabbers by issuing a federal ban on so-called “bump stocks” by authoritative fiat. PILE OF CRAP TURNING INTO AN OBAMA
3084 2018-03-28 00:34:27 Like having stocks?
3085 2018-03-28 00:34:01 Learned today that I definitely need to study way more about the stock game. Taking a break from penny stocks to study up some more thru the weekend also. Prepare myself for Monday.
3086 2018-03-28 00:33:01 This won’t do anything. Also gun violence isn’t just a school problem. We need universal background checks, ban bump stocks, ban high capacity magazines, and ban assault weapons. This will benefit schools, churches, concerts, theaters and EVERYWHERE ELSE!!!

3094 2018-03-28 00:29:57 But nobody cares if they ban bump stocks because you can literally stick your hand through your belt loop and create the same thing, and raising the minimum age would be vastly unconstitutional
3095 2018-03-28 00:29:40 "Do you know @BTS_twt?"

Boom. Stocks bought. No questions asked.
3096 2018-03-28 00:29:20 That is all BS. His "ban" is designed to never go into effect. Congress needs to create legislation to ban bump-stocks if it is going to stick in the courts. Trump knows this. The NRA probably drafted his ban for him, so they know it will fail.
3097 2018-03-28 00:28:36 This is an absolutely backwards nationalistic view that keeps sending stocks tumbling
3098 2018-03-28 00:27:21 My coming pa akong stocks from Chia Te bakery, Taipei .....darating sa friday.....
3099 2018-03-28 00:26:52 1).  Media fig Trump's silence means it can be proved   His protocol is predictable ( Truth is irrelative ) 
If solid proof ( Bush tapes) silence. 
 If neg:  (fake hair, sex alleg) " FAKE NEWS"
If positive: he owns it (Safer planes , stocks).

3101 2018-03-28 00:25:05 After 6 hours of debate the Vermont House has given its final approval to gun control legislation by a vote of 89 to 54. The bill expands background checks, bans bump stocks and large capacity magazines and raises the age to buy a gun to 21 #VTpoli
3102 2018-03-28 00:25:01 There are things your older friends can teach you that most people your age can’t...Credit, home/ car loans, stocks & bonds etc
3103 2018-03-28 00:24:53 I’ve read federally that they’re trying to ban assault weapons, ban bump stocks, require background checks, and raise the minimum age. In Florida they tried to do what you said ^ I believe but it didn’t pass.
3104 2018-03-28 00:24:52 Breaking: Vermont House votes 89 to 54 for sweeping gun-control legislation mandating background checks, raising the age to buy firearms to 21, and banning high-capacity ammunition and bump stocks. Bill now goes back to the Senate and then to @GovPhilScott, who supports it.
3105 2018-03-28 00:24:38 Hultgren said young people have become desensitized to violence! Since 2/14,I’ve seen nothing but SENSITIVITY TO VIOLENCE! &kids are doing something about it! Also,mentioned mental health,attention to phone calls,& calling bump stocks,machine guns. No mention of assault rifles./2
3106 2018-03-28 00:24:24 First 5 years: buy stocks (ex-Financials), then dump them all and buy physical $GC
3107 2018-03-28 00:21:46 I have some owned LIB since Oct/17 and I'm not following MYM other than scanning it's chart on my list of  approx: 175 #weed and #blockchain stocks.. Cheers
3108 2018-03-28 00:21:37 Bump Stocks are not the problem. Firearms, any type, any make, any model, any color and any capability are not the real problem. You said you would protect our rights and MAGA. Do it with intelligently thought out legislation that addresses the real problem.
3109 2018-03-28 00:21:15 Great news...stocks fell today 345 points...are you going to take credit for that too?

3112 2018-03-28 00:20:41 macro momentum already has slowed in q1 especially ex-US.   thing I keep coming back to is historically majority of returns during bull mkt come last 2 years & huge chunk last few months.    typically stocks don't top more than 1 yr prior to recession either.
3113 2018-03-28 00:20:13 The Vermont House passed S.55 tonight on a vote of 89-54. Increasing legal age to buy, banning bump stocks, background checks, and smaller magazines. Vote fell primarily on party lines. Putting children and families ahead of guns. #vtpoli #vtleg #vtdems @VTHouseDems @GunSenseVT

3115 2018-03-28 00:19:33 Venkatesh, apart from PNB Housing, which other stocks are ur high conviction picks?
3116 2018-03-28 00:19:32 What was the latest and greatest change to modern firearms besides scopes, sights, stocks. Most models are still over 50 years old already.
3117 2018-03-28 00:19:04 Technology stocks are suffering one of their worst beatings in years, as investors reassess a sector that has been considered the growth engine of the global economy but now faces the prospect of greater regulatory scrutiny.
3118 2018-03-28 00:18:59 IMHO as many #BTSArmy as possible should own @BigHitEnt stocks if it goes public to protect @BTS_twt @bts_bighit interests and creativity. I’m sure the guys will own some too. Eventually maybe they will run the company. 
3119 2018-03-28 00:18:52 You can't short bank stocks? WTF?!?
3120 2018-03-28 00:17:44 banning bump stocks won't do anything since the stock was made around a technique known as bump firing, people have been bump firing before bump stocks existed.

assault weapons have been illegal since 1987.

did you hear about the Maryland incident? an armed guard saved the day.
3121 2018-03-28 00:17:38 What exchange for a medium? Where do you get all your info? I'm v interested in being involved however the only thing I know regarding exhcanges in stocks is Yahoo and TDbank. I know TA extensively
3122 2018-03-28 00:17:14 So for tomorrow, back to only trading $SPX. The market is too volatile to trade individual stocks. I tried today and got crushed haha. My early suggestion would be to buy puts, but tomorrow is going to be a feel it out kinda day.
3123 2018-03-28 00:17:05 Good move. Please note..industrial timber sales are not good for watersheds and wild fish stocks. Old growth forests are especially important to slow climate change. #Haines #Chilkat #University #MentalHealthTrust #DNR #akleg
3124 2018-03-28 00:16:48 Maybe so but you DID in fact get the bump stock ban that you wanted, it was designed to take a while to go into effect because producers have make their years wages then find a new product to produce larger quantities of to replace the loss of bump stocks, it give companies time
3125 2018-03-28 00:16:18 Stop betting on companies and come bet some games @ #StockMarket #stocks
3126 2018-03-28 00:14:38 Shares of technology and financial stocks slumped Tuesday, pushing major indexes down for the fourth time in the past five trading days.
3127 2018-03-28 00:14:07 Would the author prefer to buy stocks after they are priced higher?  
3128 2018-03-28 00:13:03 I always wonder why the @SEC_News does not investigate @CitronResearch for it’s absolutely shady and disgusting practices of short selling. Andrew Left is a fraud and shorts stocks and comes out with shady reports to prop the prices down to cover.

3130 2018-03-28 00:12:06 The #DowJones & #NASDAQ are in free fall. This is being led by tech #stocks and not so much #TradeWars, now.

It started with the #Facebook #CambridgeAnalytics scandal, but appears to have spread.

I still won't call this a #BearMarket. All the Bull needs is a few good headlines!
3131 2018-03-28 00:11:58 Technology stocks are suffering one of their worst beatings in years, as investors reassess a sector that has been considered the growth engine of the global economy but now faces the prospect of greater regulatory scrutiny.

3133 2018-03-28 00:10:19 Maybe this is why I don’t do stocks....
3134 2018-03-28 00:10:14 $BTC is underperforming and so are the stock markets. Hate to say it but those looking to pull out of stocks are not going to be jumping into crypto. They will be looking for safety elsewhere.

3136 2018-03-28 00:09:14 So much for those who believe the founding fathers did not intend for our Constitution to evolve with society. So called “Originalists,” (most Republican appointed judges), ignore that many founders were slave owners and believed, stocks, whipping and hanging were the norm.
3137 2018-03-28 00:08:43 Asia stocks open lower as the region follows suit from the tech-led slide on Wall St and as trade concerns continue to linger; ASX 200 (-0.7%), Nikkei 225 (-1.8%), KOSPI (-1.1%)
3138 2018-03-28 00:07:39 more curve flattening as the 5 and 10 yr are just 210 bps apart now.  as narrow as its been in years.  bearish for stocks.

3141 2018-03-28 00:06:21 Would not touch or recommend touching penny stocks with a ten foot pole.  I mainly trade small to large cap growth stocks.
3142 2018-03-28 00:06:00 So full of it. Economy isn't Trump's, only continuation of PBO trajectory. Stocks will fall back hard, soon, overvalued. PBO didn't kiss Kings hand as Bush did, but is black Dem, so you find fault. Try being realistic in your condemnation.
3143 2018-03-28 00:05:33 Why not let us vote for one or let us choose from a set of templates? Also, why put the sign-up and exit button so far apart.
P.S.: What is the minimum amount of money one can invest into DE stocks? I do know it's an amount I do not have, though.
3144 2018-03-28 00:05:22 Bump stock eh? Well there goes your accuracy bit. Bump stocks absolutely destroy your weapon's accuracy. You know what else can be modified to shoot like that? Any semi-automatic rifle. Just because something is black, doesn't mean it's extra dangerous.
3145 2018-03-28 00:05:11 We’ve only made an exclusive batch of 30 pieces for our Atom necklace available online. While stocks last!  @ Singapore
3146 2018-03-28 00:05:01 With bump stocks?
3147 2018-03-28 00:04:29 Respect to both fighters but @anthonyfjoshua all the way! Hahaha umm uce does working on how the stocks work count as working on your public holiday thatl never happen?
3148 2018-03-28 00:04:06 I am a gun owner who supports these kids. Would love to have a conversation with you about why we shouldn’t ban bump stocks and AR-15s.
3149 2018-03-28 00:03:04 Better get you some gun maker stocks, cuz we're going to buy some more guns, at least you'll have something in your hand to laugh about
3150 2018-03-28 00:02:32 The pain was shared in other tech stocks. Twitter declined 12 percent after a famed short seller issued a negative report, predicting more regulation over its social media platform after Facebook's controversy.
3151 2018-03-28 00:02:09 Future investors beware, the financial crisis is still ahead of us. Just because your invested in stocks doesnt mean its a possibility that you cant lose all your money.
3152 2018-03-28 00:02:03 But the City Council banned bump stocks. That should help. They could have done something worthwhile to help the schools but....
3153 2018-03-28 00:01:29 Call ratios looks good here... Hows the liquidity during closing time in these stocks?
3154 2018-03-28 00:01:29 We have background checks for stores, but not gun shows... that makes no sense, it should be universal. We make fully automatic weapons illegal but allow bump stocks, that makes no sense.... any modification resulting in operating as an illegal weapon should also be illegal.
3155 2018-03-28 00:01:09 Tech stocks get belted because of bad sentiment around data storage and use and you think a recession is imminent....please
3156 2018-03-28 00:01:02 if you think tech stocks are doing poorly now just wait until the tesla earnings call
3157 2018-03-28 00:01:00 No American can directly own Chinese stocks or real estate. How DARE the commies buy our assets?
3158 2018-03-28 00:00:59 No one buys Junks unless they are junk stocks
3159 2018-03-28 00:00:40 Is bighit open to stocks? If so I really wanna buy some in the near future. As long as they're less than 2,000.
