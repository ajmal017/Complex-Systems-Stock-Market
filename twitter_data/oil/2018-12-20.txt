8 2018-12-20 23:58:53 Did you know that the protestors are fighting for oil prices? really the protestor dont care about clean energy that will benefit future generation.

Why because the ones exploiting the sensitivity of high taxes and unfair pay is the right wing parties of France. Just like Trump.

10 2018-12-20 23:58:31 You're right, their interest was just to grab the oil, control the ppl, cause disaster, propagate lies in the media and the rest is history
11 2018-12-20 23:58:24 Why are we there??? Congress never voted to be there right? When should we leave?its not our business!!! Oh but ... some congressmen get great payouts from WAR!!! Bring our soldiers home!!! Enough it’s a endless war for oil!!!

31 2018-12-20 23:57:25 Lewd oil 
32 2018-12-20 23:57:11 Oil diffusers (rods), or like..... a book you’ve wanted to read
33 2018-12-20 23:57:01 Why people won’t (yet) go to war over oil is because today’s generation is not as bothered about data privacy as we are. Was discussing this with my son and a few other teenagers/college goers and they are just not bothered about who all can access their data.
34 2018-12-20 23:56:56 @jack_conley77 he don’t have the tolerance for that hot oil
35 2018-12-20 23:56:54 The best man for the taking care of Canadian folks and pipelines for the oil province and a big raise for the senior population they have been through the bad times long enough.
36 2018-12-20 23:56:49 People think brainwashing is about snapping and turning people into  zombies. No. It is previously "no war for oil" types turning into neocons because the media told them to.
37 2018-12-20 23:56:45 When i'm in a art store and see a tube of Mummy Brown oil paint i think "is this the modern synthetic type, or did someone sneak in the real stuff?"
38 2018-12-20 23:56:44 Hey @BP_plc, I still remember the oil spill. Fuck you
39 2018-12-20 23:56:44 Massive die offs, volcanoes, Kuwaiti oil field fires, forest fires, warming oceans wouldn't even register? How is depriving energy for people to have a life that isn't as hard and mean as their forebears... saving the planet? 
Curious, what 'short term flux' would decrease CO2?
.
40 2018-12-20 23:56:43 so do you drink olive oil then?
41 2018-12-20 23:56:38 You know who won't be missed? You. The people of Oklahoma need to have someone representing them and you only represent oil/gas.
42 2018-12-20 23:56:36 I live in WA state. I know what CBD is.

Your opinion is shit and you sell snake oil. But good on you for "working for your benefits"
43 2018-12-20 23:56:34 To those that question Trump's withdrawal from Syria, and also say we're only there for oil, then what will it take to make you happy? The largest global reserve was dicovered in Texas so we have our own supply now. We don't need their oil. Syria is a hot bed. We don't need war.
44 2018-12-20 23:56:23 As opposed to the simple minded people who regurgitate false oil industry propaganda. But, I suppose you're being a uniter, while I'm being a divider.

47 2018-12-20 23:56:03 USA, Canada, China, Europe, etc could obtain most of their energy needs from hemp fuel without harm from coal and oil. They do not because of stupidity of their leaders

Environmental benefits of hemp McGill

Hemp also for sails, paper, food, parachutes, sneakers, clothing, etc
48 2018-12-20 23:56:01 Russia has a national surplus and deserve to take over all the oil in syria since they defeated US funded IsiS . Americans that support foreign intervention are moronic. Assad has done more or repair Aleppo in a year than YS has done in iraq in a decade
49 2018-12-20 23:55:54 The last 48 hours have been lime a child offered either either castor oil or cod liver oil w/ candy for @GOP members.
50 2018-12-20 23:55:48 I put too much oil in my hair and it is running down the back of my neck. 
51 2018-12-20 23:55:37 Lunch with Kimberly Wilkins and a gift exchange :) I just love my friend and my beautiful essential oil Prosper, my lava bead essential oil bracelet and my friendship Pandora charm. I enjoy my time with my amazing friend 
52 2018-12-20 23:55:27 Sips oil out of a mug. "I like to keep a bet with some of the other Devil Arms on how many days Dante can go before getting impaled, and at this rate, I'm going to win."
53 2018-12-20 23:55:23 Have you not been paying attention? One small bottle of CBD oil is worth way more than a barrel of crude!
54 2018-12-20 23:55:14 "What's his problem?" he grabbed a bag of chips a can of soda and a can of engine oil

58 2018-12-20 23:55:03 Hit Sephora up for a sample of the Luna oil! The sample they gave me lasted 3 weeks!
59 2018-12-20 23:54:59 There is nothing I can’t stand more than a greasy face!!!!!!! Invest in an oil control toner .... there’s a difference between dewy look and ur face looking like a greasy pizza
60 2018-12-20 23:54:56 .@KathyCastorFL you should be ashamed of yourself for prioritizing oil companies over the future of the planet.  No fossil fuels on the #GreenNewDeal
61 2018-12-20 23:54:47 Even as a neocon centrist, you might want to re-think Beto. He votes in lockstep with Trump and he’s the second largest recipient of oil/gas money.
62 2018-12-20 23:54:39 ‘Crude’ Oil, eh? ;P
63 2018-12-20 23:54:34 Me Damien and Nicolae in the same house waiting for the end of the 3rd Temple! And on Kashrut food and Krill oil and working out body building!
64 2018-12-20 23:54:34 If you want to keep US troops in #Syria, GFY. 

Media can GFY. Hollywood can GFY.  Neocons and Neolibs can GFY. 

Every person who wants our children to go die in far off deserts for oil can GFY. 

If you agree with me, give it a RT.
65 2018-12-20 23:54:31 And US oil prices are in free fall, ending below $46 a barrel for the first time since August 2017.
66 2018-12-20 23:54:26 Darlin, CBD oil comes from Hemp. This is why they included Hemp in the Farm Bill. It helps many people come off of opioids.
I have ruptured disc and a torn disc.  I take zero pain pills. There is no high associated with CBD oil.
67 2018-12-20 23:54:25 Not for nothing. For oil and regime change. It’s been a fake war this whole time anyways. It’s been almost 10 years since my Afghanistan deployment and I was 11 years old when 9/11 happened. Time to gtfo.
68 2018-12-20 23:54:16 Nothing says 'top' quite like getting covered in crude oil tbh

72 2018-12-20 23:53:44 5 Trillion dollars in subsidies Globally for the oil n'gas  industry  not profitable ? Why do they need subsidies ? They yell and holler about Green Energy subsidies .

74 2018-12-20 23:53:28 Why would anybody fill up at #esso when the station a block away is cheaper by 8 to 10 bucks a tank. That’s two  at happy hour. Guess somebody has to help Imperial Oil  to pay those management Christmas bonuses.  @Flapjack92 @nenshi @Royal_BLT @paul_dunphy @CanyonDentalCen
75 2018-12-20 23:52:58 If the scrub is to dry add more olive oil if it's to wet add more sugar

I wish we had taken the oil...

Either invade and conquer or leave.
79 2018-12-20 23:52:46 Thank you! It shocks me too. I was always taught if you drive you should be able to change a tire and change your own oil!
80 2018-12-20 23:52:46 Now yall debating how many chances someone should get.

94 2018-12-20 23:51:11 Digging up sh#$hole Marlago to search for oil.

96 2018-12-20 23:50:49 I make a 120k a year and I work in the oil industry. You embarrass us with your ignorance sir.
97 2018-12-20 23:50:46 We were so close to getting the oil

Mix all together take a little and exfoliate wet skin
102 2018-12-20 23:50:06 i think anyone whose mother isnt also his aunt can tell you its for oil and for weapon manufacturing interests
103 2018-12-20 23:50:03 - we’ve gone through 3 mini cycles since 08, where commodities haven’t really had a sustained bid, especially since 11, causing supply issues. Think Copper, oil (low capex), even Uranium (but less so)
104 2018-12-20 23:50:02 Coincidence that Germans using state if the art sonar detected oil there 10 years ago?
105 2018-12-20 23:50:01 We plan on marketing a line of Fennel-flavoured cannabis products suspended in Castor oil.
106 2018-12-20 23:49:47 Looks like Oil is bouncing a little. Since $usdcad moved higher as oil fell I would think as oil goes higher the pair will go lower. I remain short the pair. $oil
107 2018-12-20 23:49:39 Look up Schumer, Lukoil, Putin, Alekperov. Chuck has to work hard to divide America for that Russian oil money he totally never received.

109 2018-12-20 23:49:26 dawn claiming that their soap saves animals in oil spills is such bullshit bc dawn can’t even get oil off my paintbrushes

113 2018-12-20 23:49:00 Fact check: Mustard oil does NOT increase cholesterol risk. Also, any plant based oil do not have cholesterol in them pea se.
114 2018-12-20 23:48:58 Tea tree oil works as well!
115 2018-12-20 23:48:28 今日から冬季休暇だから気分は土曜日なんだけどまだ平日か
116 2018-12-20 23:48:16 I would argue the intent and outcome were not the same. Dunn was out of sorts when he was hit and that was due to the force Khaira used. It sucks b/c he was retaliating but that doesn't make it ok for him to go to the extent he did. JJ's a strong kid but he needs to control it.

118 2018-12-20 23:48:08 Oil pressure gone...temp gauge maxed...empty tank...next gas 2020...
119 2018-12-20 23:48:06 Waiting to get my oil changed and it’s taking forever but at least I won’t have to do it on my day off 
120 2018-12-20 23:48:03 If the US and subsequently the world goes into depression who do they think will buy Russian oil and gas?
121 2018-12-20 23:47:57 Maassalam...
122 2018-12-20 23:47:50 CBD is fake medicine and you peddle snake oil and your opinion is bad and poorly thought out.
123 2018-12-20 23:47:40 Oh! An alchemist! A writer of fiction and non fiction is an expert in oil blends now. Well, I can tell you post is fiction...
124 2018-12-20 23:47:09 Fully agreed, I mean to say that when US Legal, lots of greenhouses in various states will make no sense to use when you can buy oil for your margin added products for pennies from LATAM. Especially since can't ship across state lines currently, less benefit of econ of scale
125 2018-12-20 23:47:07 Ok, but irrespective of the pullout (which is the right thing to do) how can the Kurds in Rojava possibly survive when we are actively arming Turkey? We have to condemn the continuation of neocon policy -in this case oil rights in aTurkish petro-state.
126 2018-12-20 23:47:01 & while I still need to buy presents, my car needs it oil change.
127 2018-12-20 23:46:54 Stop acting like a shill for Alberta. You are a Federal Natural Resources Minister not a Provincial one. You over see rare species protection, forestry & sustainable use of resources. Oil pollution &  climate change works against it. Apply fiscal prudence & work responsibility.
128 2018-12-20 23:46:44 Seriously, I'm a virgin! Where do you think they get virgin olive oil?
129 2018-12-20 23:46:41 Many industries have foreign ownership (eg auto sector) What we need to consider is their intention and the outcomes they create for Canadians, not the proportion of the ownership.
Foreign investment in the oil sands improves the economy and creates a net benefit for Canada
130 2018-12-20 23:46:40 They aren't exactly oil and water.

President Trump cancelled Obama's CIA funding of weapons for the Syrian rebels-almost all of whom are either ISIS or Al Qaeda!

148 2018-12-20 23:44:54 I'd heard about that. Something about the oil in the plastic????
149 2018-12-20 23:44:39 Ah perhaps it's the glass rather than the oil! But then... no that doesn't make sense either. It can't be plastic. Glass is always... see-through? I want to buy one JUST to find out now.

151 2018-12-20 23:44:00 Keep dreaming.  Cheap energy drives wealth.  The rest of world will just make a buck off our your Pollyanna hope.  The world isn't transitioning off hydrocarbons soon.  Oil demand is rising...
152 2018-12-20 23:44:00 Since they’re literally ISIS, we could fight them, but there goes our cheap oil.
153 2018-12-20 23:43:55 They need to go back to Memphis, Lucas Oil Raceway, Pikes Peak, Montreal, Milwaukee and so on
154 2018-12-20 23:43:54 It's an oil not just a smell.
155 2018-12-20 23:43:46 Coconut and Castrol oil in your hair is all so good till it drips down all the way to your eyes,RIP
156 2018-12-20 23:43:42 After I wash that out, I press out the water and massage the hair with a repair oil to make the damaged hair look healthy. Then I air dry and occasionally apply purple spray conditioner on yellow spots. When they are dry, I massage some more oil into the ends.

158 2018-12-20 23:43:06 Kind of like when my barber sprays some olive oil shit on my hair after and it is awesome
159 2018-12-20 23:42:59 Yeah it isn’t the best made one i don’t think but I the photo doesn’t do it any favours. I’d have thought the oil would look a bit better in person but the details on the console are a bit lazy and it does look very plasticky. the idea is brill tho.
160 2018-12-20 23:42:58 Yes indeed:) Day after 9/11 world was with us. Dubya squandered sent soldiers to hornets nest, world hated us 'mission accomplished'. Globalist agenda to install Rothchild bank in Iraq since Saddam switched off OPEC $. Too much profit in Afghan poppy, oil, Sumerian treasure, etc
161 2018-12-20 23:42:55 So glad that Money is coming now the oil companies can buy the Xmas presents. Don't help the common roughneck. Bull shit build a pipeline so Sask & Alberta can get back to work. Sick of hearing about Alberta all the time think about the rest also like Sask & Manitoba.
162 2018-12-20 23:42:50 Eric Prince to the resue? And how trump org can profit from the REM and oil.
163 2018-12-20 23:42:44 Well.  Oiled. Machine.   

If that machine were a blender and you're using car oil, of course.
164 2018-12-20 23:42:34 朝起きてストーブつけたら、ストーブがピーピーなって「OIL」って表示が出たのよ…これって…
165 2018-12-20 23:42:33 My west coast blast... (must be the rain?!?).  Last nights blast... my yield is still all over the place....As long as the weight is going upward I’m cool with it!!    
        So... I think these pics of oil are sexy!!   Anyone else agree???
166 2018-12-20 23:42:30 mods change my name to miracle creamhorse oil
167 2018-12-20 23:42:28 A veggie salad with dressing(if you have Italian dressing, ranch, or olive oil), spices (salt, pepper, whatever you like) and the raw veggies. Stir fry or roasted veggies.  Season and cook those collard greens.
168 2018-12-20 23:42:26 ยังไงก็น่ารัก 
169 2018-12-20 23:42:25 Dan how come the oil companies were fast to spike a 17 cent a litre increase for gas, but now they are taking their time dropping down in price out here in Vancouver?
170 2018-12-20 23:42:24 That’s the thing though. They don’t all hate us lol it’s only the radical people. The Afghani people are some of the most hospitable people I’ve ever met. We’re there for oil and nation building.
171 2018-12-20 23:41:54 My knee has been giving me trouble for a while now & my dad always makes me try the wildest home remedies...currently can’t sleep because my knee is ON FIRE because of a cayenne pepper, grated ginger and hot olive oil mixture
172 2018-12-20 23:41:49 so apparently keloids from my industrial wont go away on their own n I was relying on them to just leave so now I have to use tea tree oil fuck
173 2018-12-20 23:41:40 Ditto
174 2018-12-20 23:41:27 I don't even have a lamp oil to lose, but i've still decided that im the king!
175 2018-12-20 23:41:07 I was a massive fan of oil and used to see things others didn't comment on. His movement off the ball was fantastic and dragged the defenders all over the place, hence he got the space to do what he is good at.
But things have changed and of he doesn't suit what do you do? 2/2
176 2018-12-20 23:40:58 Its all about arms sales - its all about oil - its all about fake news and the gullibility of the masses, who still believe civilian planes crashed into the twin towers 
177 2018-12-20 23:40:56 "If Trump wanted to start wars"......Trump has discovered a way of LOSING THE WAR......without even having it. Trump is ceding control of the world's oil suppy, in the Middle East, to the Russians. How Putin leverages that control will determine future GLOBAL POLITICS.
178 2018-12-20 23:40:31 狗狼くーん！あっ違ったカミ君ー！
179 2018-12-20 23:40:31 Oh C'mon. The gop is owned by big oil & deny #climatechange.
180 2018-12-20 23:40:27 I hope we do end these wars for oil and resources. Maybe he read all the folks replies when he was demanding the wall money who said get the money from DoD.
181 2018-12-20 23:40:24 Articles of clothing made with Hemp last way to long, the clothing industry doesn't want that! They want stuff that wears out after a few years so they can sell more. They won't let it go main stream like the oil industry won't let electric vehicles happen in mass quantities!

184 2018-12-20 23:40:07 HAHA. I have been doing a lot of writing at work about food & beverage analysis & did olive oil about a month ago! Pretty strict standards for EVOO! BTW - you are a great writer & your article about mental health is amazing!! Keep it up!! 
185 2018-12-20 23:40:02 The most damning thing - when asked if she wouldnt take fossil fuel money, @KathyCastorFL said "I dont know" per @AlexCKaufman . This is a Democrat who's not sure if she'll take oil money. We need 1000 more AOC's
186 2018-12-20 23:39:57 This actually looks like an oil painting and I LOOOVE it but I want a tutorial with just this eye look cuz it’s COLORFUL AND PRETTY.
187 2018-12-20 23:39:56 it's cool! i do wonder though if it's just the photo making the oil seem a bit murky? can't see how oil could be any less than completely clear but that would be a cause of concern
188 2018-12-20 23:39:52 $25 Billion LNG, 4.5 Billion Trans Mountain, Energy East, GM, Alberta Oil, General Dynamics $13 Billion, Carbon Tax, UN Migration, Open Borders, $60 Million to Terrorist... all lost because of a failed PM and his arrogant policies! Who voted for this asshole?
189 2018-12-20 23:39:46 @BretBaier AB Stoddard sounds like a smoker which is another bad decision. These people act like they know so much more than @POTUS . Where’s @MZHemingway! ? Sickening seeing @NancyPelosi & @SenSchumer squirm like snake oil sales people.
190 2018-12-20 23:39:46 tbf u already got me the oil diffuser so that's one of the presents sorted !!!
191 2018-12-20 23:39:41 Now send em to a country that has more oil, smart guy, Venzuela be ready your oil is USA property.
192 2018-12-20 23:39:31 disgusting. the holdings and assets of the oil industry and their lobbyists and politicians should be seized at the profits of a corrupt criminal enterprise and be used to build a new green power infrastructure
193 2018-12-20 23:39:28 Don't you love how libtards love 2 use science as shield, but then r unable 2 provide any credible studies? 
Mental disconnect of highest magnitude, thinking you can just turn off the oil tap and all will be well. mouth breathers probly dont even realise their car runs on gas
194 2018-12-20 23:39:19 Uhh.... there's no oil in either Syria or Afghanistan. But don't let facts stop you.

Carry on.
195 2018-12-20 23:39:08 And was the $30 drop in oil reflected in the inflation indicators? Oil crash gave the room for the Fed to call an audible but they chose to not give it any credit which I think was a mistake. Just my opinion
196 2018-12-20 23:39:05 Read the numbers the other day Oil and Gas industry gets 5 TRILLION DOLLARS A YEAR GLOBALLY IN SUBSIDES ...to what stay afloat .
197 2018-12-20 23:38:49 Trump’s “declare victory and leave” speech was a snake oil salesman’s pitch complete with a “dead soldiers in the sky agree with me” and he pointed at the sky. Swear to god.
198 2018-12-20 23:38:47 Lol. Why do we care about the Middle East we have plenty of oil now. The blood of America’s young is on you neocons hands. Bring the boys home!
199 2018-12-20 23:38:46 Same intent, same outcome, neither injured, but both went for the head. Should be same disciplinary penalty.
200 2018-12-20 23:38:43 C: Break time from Smash, just for a bit! I just got done with a cool match with a G&W. I feel like they deserved the win more than I, they Oil Panic'ed a Thunder I sent out and KOed me. I have never even seen a G&W pull that off before, it was such an awesome play~!
201 2018-12-20 23:38:41 Where was Max yesterday when the oil patch workers were out in force in Alberta supporting their industry and jobs? Probably at home drafting another tweet dissing Sheer while he  was actually there in support.
202 2018-12-20 23:38:29 Why should the US keep paying out the nose to fight terrorists in other countries? Trump campaigned over and over he's pulling out of Syria. The US is the largest producer of oil in the world now, we don't need the middle east. Arm our allies with weapons they pay for and leave.
203 2018-12-20 23:38:28 Having fun at our Holiday Oil Party! Playin name that oil, cake walk oil style, and oil bingo. We love our essential oils and good times.
204 2018-12-20 23:38:19 are you saying allying yourself with a superpower that views you as a pawn in a 12 dimensional chess game to knock a few cents of the price of oil might be a devil's bargain?
205 2018-12-20 23:38:13 "Great I have every thing perfectly budgeted to the dollar for the next week! Now I won't have to deal with fees from my back for taking money out of my Savings a fifth time!"

213 2018-12-20 23:37:27 AB is so full of Banana Oil saying the markets are roiling on a pending government shutdown. Did she miss the Fed rate hike yesterday? Fed Funds rate is now 2.5%. The yield curve is flat. Risk is being repriced for the first time since 2009. #SpecialReport @BretBaier

215 2018-12-20 23:37:22 I don’t know if the gummies are as potent do you use straight oil? And put in coffee? Or under your tongue?
216 2018-12-20 23:37:09 This gesture shows how out of touch the Liberal government is. Loans to get out of oil into “green” energy?  Garbage. Allow some damn pipelines to be built so people can work and feed their family. This climate fraud bullshit has gone on long enough. Bring back some common sense
217 2018-12-20 23:37:07 Nicole, Angelica, Hannah & I were today years old when we discovered that evoo means extra virgin olive oil

223 2018-12-20 23:36:40 You talk mighty big from someone not sitting in the President’s chair and yonever served in the US Armed forces. We don’t want a war with Russia this is all over oil which we don’t need. I want our troops home. As for Isis thank their Dead Daddy John McCain. Grow a set of balls.

234 2018-12-20 23:35:40 Trump manages to find a Defense Secretary named "Mad Dog" (Mattis) that is the most rational person in the DoD, and an oil executive (Tillerson) that is a a reasonable ambassador to head the State Debt, and Trump fires them both. #WorldNewsTonight

237 2018-12-20 23:35:22 oil is needed, at least for now. There was talk of drilling east of NYC...shipping lanes etc would have to be reworked etc. As for his tax returns...I just read that Mueller now has them so they may be made public in the near future. Trump promised (and is obligated!) to release.
238 2018-12-20 23:35:09 Ban Palm Oil #IfYouCouldChangeOneThing

239 2018-12-20 23:35:07 What a change - "Industry and diplomatic experts unhesitatingly expressed the belief that Libya would find buyers for her oil at $6 a barrel, the price announced by Premier Abdul Salem Jalloud."

244 2018-12-20 23:34:39 Really? Wow! And East Timor confirms that the LNP  bugged its embassy during Timor oil negotiations. But nothing to see there.
245 2018-12-20 23:34:35 Harvest the oil from the oily parys and use it on the dry parts.. Will balance both out
246 2018-12-20 23:34:35 I always procrastinate getting my oil changed (yes I know shame on me) I just seriously hate sitting here waiting for it to be done 
247 2018-12-20 23:34:29 lol.
Russian coal, timber, gas and oil production are all declining under Trump. The four largest revenue sources. 
Weapon sales are up but weapons expanded are up more.
248 2018-12-20 23:34:25 You know zero about oil industry, everything is made with oil and you would die within 2 weeks - a month if oil stopped existing
249 2018-12-20 23:34:12 i guess he really is like a white obama if he is fighting so hard for the oil industry!
250 2018-12-20 23:33:56 Mine's caused by a combo of PCOS and genetics. No thickening or hair retention product ever worked. I think the volume has come from a better oil balance. I guess it's different for everyone.

252 2018-12-20 23:33:41 USA always gets involved without being called...they only look for oil...if Trump admin is planning on stepping out is probably because oil will be a non issue in the future years
253 2018-12-20 23:33:36 Trump and the military industrial complex are not there to "NATION BUILDING", only to destroy, provoke chaos & divisions. 
The Kurds in #Syria are a population of only 2million, they now occupy one third of Syria with all the oil fields, on territory which they never lived in

255 2018-12-20 23:33:16 As of late I’ve had such an affinity with roasted Fall/Winter veggies. Brusselsprouts, boiler/pearl onions, baby French carrots, and potato medley w/ olive oil, pepper, and black truffle salt. Simple and dat ish right there is MAGIC.
256 2018-12-20 23:33:16 It’s all about the OIL!!!! You don’t have to worry about it because you don’t have to pump your own gas.

258 2018-12-20 23:32:55 yeah.. taking the skin off and drying it in the fridge uncovered for 24 hours is one recommended way of getting it dry enough

me, i just use a paper towel, a bunch of oil and fuckloads of salt
259 2018-12-20 23:32:52 (Not @Nicole_Cliffe, but I’m in the same boat, and I’ve had great luck with Soap & Glory Vitamin C face wash for the acne, and Sunday Riley Luna Sleeping Oil for dark spots!)
260 2018-12-20 23:32:42 Oh, so you prefer oil from dictatorship that beheads gay people and journalists? Nice. Says a lot about you as a person.
261 2018-12-20 23:32:34 True, consecutive PC govt's squandered away the chance to build huge trust fund if they would have charged appropriate royalties, & if they would have spurred on secondary industries connected to the oil and gas industries there would be a multiplier on revenue.

268 2018-12-20 23:31:25 gotta heat that oil to keep the wax moving gurl! it's honestly just a simple bulb. keep it on a steady surface and you'll be absolutely golden.
269 2018-12-20 23:30:47 Oh, we would. Because without a pipeline if oil was at $120 a barrel, Western Canada Select would be selling for $30-$40 a barrel. Better than the $10 a barrel it sold for a couple of weeks ago but not enough for investors to hang in.
270 2018-12-20 23:30:46 Mix 4 1/2 tbsps buritto with 2 quarts broccoli. Add Olive Oil. Boil. Serve the next morning for breakfast.

A country with fertile land , oil everywhere , gold and with the longest river in the world running through its capital. 

You stole our money and your time has come. 

KARAMA!
284 2018-12-20 23:29:43 ...and if you mean getting your oil south then west, if it were that easy, you'd be doing it now. The US has more fracking oil than it can deal with already. 

The only way I see this as viable is if you were willing to become the 51st state. Maybe many are.

286 2018-12-20 23:29:28 Senator, please tell me what the end state is? Democracy? So the people elect the Muslim brotherhood! The free flow of oil? Protect Israel? I am tired of watching our son's die over there, especially for people that dislike us.
287 2018-12-20 23:29:26 And racism. Racism is the motor oil. Personal financial gain is the gas.
288 2018-12-20 23:29:11 *Treasure for Israel.

Ftfy, we have gotten no oil out of this and all the major big pharma companies that use opium are based out of Israel.

294 2018-12-20 23:28:39 Trump belongs to big oil and I am betting so does Putin.
295 2018-12-20 23:28:36 Everyone go to Trump twitter and ask him to sign an executive order pledging all gofundme money collected for the wall to go to the wall.  i just did that the more that do this he may see it and do it.  remember the squeaky wheel gets the oil.
296 2018-12-20 23:28:36 Yeah lillies are the worst! It's the little bits in the centre rather than the petals isn't it? Also, keep ALL essential oils away, even if the specific oil isn't 'toxic'. Any diffusers with essential oils will make your cats unwell!!
297 2018-12-20 23:28:20 At some point, we are meddling. I love the Kurdish people. How about we build us a wall and build them one too? Others want Kurdish territory because it has oil.
298 2018-12-20 23:28:14 Oil down to 45, yeeha
299 2018-12-20 23:28:12 I had a CBD oil gummy a couple times last week while at work but I didn’t notice any effects.

POW! BANG! BOOM! 

Next go funds thousands of catapults to hurl millions of molten balls of oil over the wall to counter evil cartels bringing their ill-gotten goods into these USA. 

Tune in same wall time same wall channel for next wall fund me episode.
301 2018-12-20 23:27:51 I do not understand Fed Reserve Chair's economic-logic & resulting decision-making to increase interest-rate when crude oil is trading at less than $50USD per barrel? By crude-oil trading low will in-effect act as a market-brake on US economic-growth.
302 2018-12-20 23:27:45 Buy you a oil burning furnace to heat the shop
303 2018-12-20 23:27:25 That's not exactly true.  Opium, Oil and natural gas are all resources those areas have to pilfer.
304 2018-12-20 23:27:21 I just fried my finger in boiling oil.. how is your night going?
305 2018-12-20 23:26:18 This time of year big business will try to sell you water,  essential oil, aroma compounds, fixatives solvents, and known toxins. So hold off the perfume and aftershave this Christmas and let the asthmatics among us breathe easier. This has been a public service announcement

What is Trudeau suppose to do about the Supreme Court? Or Quebec's opposition to Energy East? What could Scheer do better? Hell, Trump can't (or won't) do Keystone.
309 2018-12-20 23:25:41 I can only hope to be this oily and  jacked if I stick to my oil, gym and wind instrument routine.

311 2018-12-20 23:25:25 Oil needs somewhere to relax, too!
312 2018-12-20 23:25:24 You overestimate your negotiating position. If you can avoid Canadian airspace, Canadians can certainly avoid Alberta's.

Besides the pre-Albertastan loss of oil revenues, rail would be your biggest, and realistically your only, chip. Why exactly would you just give it away?
313 2018-12-20 23:25:19 My team lead told me she watched my video about CBD oil, and that she even noticed the change in me and my focus/productivity
314 2018-12-20 23:25:18 It was a bit weird. He was used to drinking milk, but he drank all the oil he could anyways, still bein quite rough with what he did.

319 2018-12-20 23:24:31 #oil collapse first. #natgas collapse second.
320 2018-12-20 23:24:29 A barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude oil is at $46 bucks. FYI.
321 2018-12-20 23:24:23 Russia & Assad have won the war and have control of the country now. 

Keeping them there to cause more ruckus and hold some oil fields to gain some leverage in postwar negotiations can be problematic.
322 2018-12-20 23:24:12 Honestly I feel sorry for the oil workers desperately clinging onto their dying industry. I don't think they know any better.

Seems most conservatives are science/tech illiterate and although they themselves will fall behind because of it, progress as a whole is also stunted.

326 2018-12-20 23:23:36 @Uncle_Dudley18 Persian Gulf, the Suez canal, and probably 50% of the oil in Saudi Arabia, peak oil reached in late 70's, but still enough to make them an energy superpower. ISIL will settle in the east, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Uzbekistan. Iran, via Hezbollah will take Syria.

328 2018-12-20 23:23:00 I see Ohio has a very well developed industry of carcinogenic Oil & Gas...
329 2018-12-20 23:22:55 tbh i think the only reason the US got involved in Syria was the oil they thought they could get from the Kurds + proxy wars with Iran & Russia
330 2018-12-20 23:22:54 Filters are for oil.
331 2018-12-20 23:22:51 In my research: "are humans more important than oil?" I had discovered that Venezuela is Not allow to jail opposition But Colombia is Allow to killed opposition. Soooooooooo Oil is more important than people.

338 2018-12-20 23:22:23 Use castor oil it works better !!
339 2018-12-20 23:22:17 Missed you.
340 2018-12-20 23:22:16 It should be criminal to ignore climate change. People who keep increasing oil and gas production and deforestation are condemning the next generation to extreme fires, extreme heat, drought and food and water shortages.
341 2018-12-20 23:22:06 For starters we could use some more rail cars to get our oil to market. More refineries could be built in Alberta, then our crude wouldn’t have to be sent south or east. We’d have more product readily available to take to rail to be bought and shipped off the west coast.
342 2018-12-20 23:21:59 It isn’t isolationism. We are absolutely treating China as an adversary, (Russia is economically powerless due to its weakened position in Oil/energy and we *made* ISIS by intervening in Iraq 15 years ago.
343 2018-12-20 23:21:19 Just couldn't help yourself, could you? 
The oil industry is dying...as it should.  Green is the option we need to go if we want a shot at saving this planet for generations that come after us.  That's not Trudeau's fault. Carbon tax & regulations are necessary.

364 2018-12-20 23:18:56 Oh yeah, and because Russia is the main oil supplier in the world, oil from the middle East is no longer profitable for USA so they're pulling out coz USA is about to go bust with the next world economic crisis, created by the Fed, the banks and Finance department corruption etc

426 2018-12-20 23:13:02 The truth is that you are pulling the US military out of syria so that russia can take over. Trying to get cheap syrian oil from putin, aren't ya?
427 2018-12-20 23:12:54 Putin will have a monopoly on the last peak oil countries including Russia. Gitbus by the balls! WTF?!?!
428 2018-12-20 23:12:52 Amazing and this will continue to continue to visit this community big time as US oil and gas production increases capacity and energy prices slide!
429 2018-12-20 23:12:51 Why the hell would the US need the oil there? They're the number 1 oil producer in the world and have friendly relations with most of the next 10.
430 2018-12-20 23:12:36 You know what is unbelievable? You! Same ol' out of you and @CPC_HQ . Propose solutions and alternatives to diversify our economic reliance on oil, such as creating power from the hot air coming out of your mouth #renewableenergy

438 2018-12-20 23:12:13 It's all yours and Putin's master plan ! US vacates the middle east and the Russians step in...WTG you just lost cheap oil
439 2018-12-20 23:12:09 Sen. Graham: Mattis thinks 'the job in Syria is not yet done' despite Trump's order to withdraw troops: Hey, you queer "koch"sukka ! ISIS have every right to come back to THEIR COUNTRY AND THEIR "OIL" FIELDS, YOU PHUK'N LYIN' AZZ REPUBLICUNT PHUK'N HOOD !!! GO BACK TO SC !
440 2018-12-20 23:11:56 No currently oil is (mostly) transported by rail. Which statistically much less safe than through a pipeline. 
441 2018-12-20 23:11:52 Bissalaam
442 2018-12-20 23:11:37 Over a thousand of institutions have divested from coal, gas and oil companies. That should be a sign that pipelines are worthless now.

444 2018-12-20 23:11:24 So over 1,000,000 acres in Wyoming auctioned off to oil and gas. My concern is that if these companies decide to frack in northern WY near the Yellowstone Caldera and happen to cause earthquakes...

449 2018-12-20 23:10:55 Ask him why it's a huge mistake. Why are we in Syria? What is the U.S. interest in Syria? (a pipeline) Our only interests in the middle east are protecting Israel and oil. Why? The answer is Fed note (dollar) is being propped up by oil sales using dollars.

452 2018-12-20 23:10:39 Excellent idea. Withdraw all the US troops, navy and air force completely from around the world. 

I wonder how quickly you'll be begging to redeploy them when China and Russia are dictating oil prices.

Not sure how you'll employ almost 500,000 idle servicemen. Mexico border??
453 2018-12-20 23:10:30 We are about 45 years away from the end of oil. The clock is ticking. We are going to need to transition to alternate, cleaner forms of renewable energy soon. Our reliance on oil is choking the planet. Cons don’t like facts, evidence or science...simple ideas and slogans only

460 2018-12-20 23:10:12 Syria has about 1% of what Saudi has in proved reserves. They rank 31st in production with a fairly steep decline rate. The world is awash in oil. Russia can’t sell theirs because of the high cost of production in their country. Removing Syrian oil from market, = little impact.

468 2018-12-20 23:09:25 Thinking you should separate, why dont you just help focus and strengthen,  instead?

Positivity goes far. These problems face everyone. No we dont want your stupid pipelines if we can switch to other energies, and only use oil and gas for plastics etc. But hey. I bet ppl would

There are NO muscles that control pore opening or closing. Warm water helps losen oil which can aid in declogging pores a bit.
479 2018-12-20 23:07:48 @AbraxasSpa @bidatzi what is your take about Mattis’ resignation?Is it purely because of Syria or some current/future geopolitics (China-US trade war, oil, etc.) playing its role too?

529 2018-12-20 23:01:53 Thank you! I have fibromyalgia and benefitted from CBD oil in the States. Didn’t know it was legal here yet. This is going to help so much.
530 2018-12-20 23:01:52 What was the good reason??? Because Mattis along with the shadow government wanted to go to war with Syria? Don’t you think those poor people have had enough...don’t you know that the real reason they’re  interested in Syria is because of its oil? Think before opening your mouth!
531 2018-12-20 23:01:51 Get well homie! I got some oil blend remedies if you need
532 2018-12-20 23:01:50 I'm not talking about the oil market exclusively, I'm talking about hundreds of markets that the government took, destroyed and left to die
533 2018-12-20 23:01:37 You as expert in Middle East ! Why you don’t ask Your NATO member Turkey to fight them ! Oops they are also founder of Isis and oil partner for many years ! Marco  remember @EmmanuelMacron  also behind Isis he is POS  he support them most Isis are France citizens

537 2018-12-20 23:01:19 you apparently know nothing of the consequences of this.  Russia and IRAN gain more oil and become stronger, The Kurds are wiped off the face of the Earth, and Bashad is free to do whatever he wants to the people of Syria.
538 2018-12-20 23:01:11 maybe the oil will fix that crack :(
539 2018-12-20 23:01:08 I just moved to Victoria. Around here, saying you are from the oil patch or otherwise supportive of a west coast pipeline is about the same as admitting you are a pedophile. All a matter of perspective.

547 2018-12-20 23:00:25 When conservatives go to the Dr. do they ignore the advice? You tell your mechanic you don’t really need oil? You wave your right to remain silent?

558 2018-12-20 22:59:41 Try eco styling gel with olive oil. I do my moms hair with it and it lasts for more than a week.

566 2018-12-20 22:58:55 Putin helped elect Trump to restore $500 billion Exxon oil deal killed by sanctions. Now Trump is going to lift sanctions on the biggest Russian oil company. He is doing exactly what Putin told him to do or else Putin is going to tell the whole world what he has on Trump.
567 2018-12-20 22:58:55 All I can say there will be millions of people burning in the oil fires of hell
568 2018-12-20 22:58:54 This is a very intensely high Vata time of year so look for Vata pacifying remedies in Ayurveda, many simple inexpensive ways to balance people such as warm sesame oil massage, see in Perfect Health, book by Deepak Chopra, avoid garlic, onions, meat, more online 4 health peaceIMO

570 2018-12-20 22:58:43 They can contribute N50 each to support police,  this number should be electronically kept for tax or levy.  At least N50/month will go along way to create more infrastructures for them assuming we don't have oil. We can use it for subsidy on agriculture y we deregulate fuel.
571 2018-12-20 22:58:18 What did we get by opposing Iran and embracing Saudi Arabia for 45 years? Have we bought oil cheaper or advanced liberty in the ME? Have we improved the lives of Americans? Have we prevented devastating violence in the ME or prevented attacks against us?

None of the above.
572 2018-12-20 22:58:15 Kind of contradicts what you just tweeted about mismanagement. The fact is, oil demand is at or near an all-time high. The fact is Alberta has decades of oil reserves. The fact is activists are shutting down Canadian oil while ignoring the other countries producing oil.
573 2018-12-20 22:58:11 Hahahaaaaaaa buhari. We have come again. 

But at least we now know where the excess crude oil money is  

Smh
574 2018-12-20 22:58:10 SYRIA!    OIL!
575 2018-12-20 22:58:08 Other than what I suggested I heard mango, lime & castor oil is really good. (It’s a product that’s literally called that with a yellow & green label) and aunt Jackie beard balm seems good too
576 2018-12-20 22:57:59 Sunderland’Til I Die is brill. Crying shame how inept people were controlling the club for some time. I really think somebody watching this (ie a big rich Sheik/oil tycoon) could potentially try and take over club & take it to the top. Similar to Man City/Chelsea. @Fulwell73 
577 2018-12-20 22:57:57 I am in Spain and went to this little place called called La Abariza. The sirloin iberico was hands down the best thing I've ever consumed and they made their own olive oil which was absolutely fantastic.
578 2018-12-20 22:57:54 On the basis that vegans hit hard about palm oil and Nestle has a very strong history with it, I'd probably focus on not pandering to extremists. Imagine what vegans'd say if they looked into the palm oil stuff or baby milk scandals. That'd be awkward to laugh away.
579 2018-12-20 22:57:51 Truly. Also, even with washing it once or twice a week, it's already starting to gravitate wispily skyward. I'm gonna need to do a hot oil treatment soon

584 2018-12-20 22:57:18 Ah. I see. You don’t live in AB.  Did you?  Take a look at google earth of Nisku. Lotsa fab shops, assembly yards, and suppliers/contractors. 22km of trucks driven by people impacted by an oil amd gas slowdown would be easy. 
Heck, there’s an auction yard along the hwy. lookit it
585 2018-12-20 22:57:17 We spent the Soviet Union into dissolution with the arms race! The Russians are doing the same to NATO with oil!  Eliminate competition from other sources in the Middle East, raise prices & spend NATO into dissolution!
586 2018-12-20 22:57:14 When CBCCalgary came to visit us, our founder Evelyne Nyario told them her story of how she journeyed from oil and gas to making a positive impact around the globe.

589 2018-12-20 22:57:10 Oil executives are openly saying in public that the government is to blame for ability to build pipelines through overerregulation and companies are leaving Alberta in droves because of carbon tax and inability to get project approval, direct result of Trudeau government
590 2018-12-20 22:57:05 @SAVEURMAG Have you tested this one recently? I'm wondering what I may have done wrong. It feels like it needs liquids or fats? Chalky instead of chewy. I added butter, coconut oil and egg... Hmm.
591 2018-12-20 22:56:42 Your snake oil salesmen that is running for the next train - go peddle your crap somewhere else but we are thankful it’s finally over. Thanks for the huge debt & tacit approval for Trump’s crimes now be gone & go grift somewhere else.
592 2018-12-20 22:56:40 Ya I feel for you. One of the people I'll be hanging with is on Greenpeaces top 100 worst people for the environment list. The upper levels all believe in climate change btw. They just believe in being the ones that profit while we can still sell oil.
593 2018-12-20 22:56:35 U know nothing about economics. U only listen to lie Mohammed. Who prepared 2015 budget? What was the oil benchmark for that year? How much did they later sell oil. Those are the factors and not all this nagging u r doing here.
594 2018-12-20 22:56:35 I wonder what Putin thought when Trump allowed Poland to buy anti-missile defenses, or sold lethal weapons to Ukraine, both denied by Obama.
Or how about increasing oil production at home? That certainly didn't help Russia.
595 2018-12-20 22:56:27 He's not ending a war, he's leaving a war so Putin can claim the Oil!! In return #45 retires with a nice chunk of change from Putin!! JS
596 2018-12-20 22:56:23 You guys are always crying over trade wars and agriculture, but the oil industry can go bust and you just ho hum, we'll just import more from Saudi Arabia, et al.  Lower oil prices= rigs released, production slows or stops and thousands of jobs are lost - ho hum! Low gas-yey!
597 2018-12-20 22:56:17 girls will really hop in the whip with bald tires no oil change in years and have the nerve to ask why their car drives weird
598 2018-12-20 22:56:12 Two things that make me nervous:
1. Getting weight at the doctors.
2. When the man changing my oil invites another man to look under the hood at something. 

I've been through both today.

603 2018-12-20 22:55:57 President Trump, why not open the vast oil reserves in Alaska, by executive order, which action would result in a great price reduction for fuel, and thereby relieve the citizenry of the exorbitant fuel taxation by State and federal legislators?
604 2018-12-20 22:55:50 Needs an abstract oil painting, but it’s still cool.

India needs to start producing huge volume of car ; van; truck oprrated on electric or rechargeable heavy duty engine (battery ) to avoid oil depends and pollution of environment. 
Switch to energy can save environment;and produce industry or sector and work for youth.
610 2018-12-20 22:55:34 Re: Rail transport for AB oil. It is unlikely that a helpful/impactful number of unit trains for shipping AB oil could be in service before Line 3 is (end of 2019), therefore the discussion is largely moot. It's not unusual for P&P discussions to be moot. #cdnpoli #abpoli @PnPCBC
611 2018-12-20 22:55:30 In October 2018, Texas average crude oil production was 2.9 million barrels per day.

That's more than Kuwait's average daily production in 2017.

612 2018-12-20 22:55:28 No.   Israel, a citadel, protects oil and other products through the region.  As those resources strain, so do politics. The world economy invests in this citadel. To disrupt it would mean a major collapse of resources.  Suez Canal is a thing.  Habitat collapse is a thing.
613 2018-12-20 22:55:22 The US doesn’t want AB oil to go up in value. Separation is a non -starter. Wingnuts enjoying some media time.

#Norway owns about 67% of its oil. Will you consider the Norwegian model for #Canada. That of course above the royalties provincial governments receive. Canada could start by small share and build up through purchase of stocks. Canadians owns the oil
619 2018-12-20 22:54:45 they got these balls of THC oil right? 3000 grams of THC in a ball, right? they dub it Dragonballs.

622 2018-12-20 22:54:21 I see another autonomous state being created like Northern Iraq. Which will link up with it. Effectively creating Kurdistan. Being the US puppet in the region. They tried grabbing Kirkuk oil with Iraq invasion. That hasn't worked so far, instead they steal Syria's oil.

648 2018-12-20 22:51:31 Oil and Gas is 2% of Canada's GDP, so this article is saying that Green energy, sitting at 3.7% is better than Oil and Gas.

And of course, Candice thinks the same as well, otherwise she wouldn't have shared it.

651 2018-12-20 22:51:17 The US is virtually oil independent right now, and pumping more every day. The Middle East is not the oil producer of the world anymore and in a decade will have reduced production as they're simply running out.

658 2018-12-20 22:50:47 That's your government hard at work ensuring car ownership is unaffordable for regular people. I sure it's all done under guise of ecology and whatnot of course.

659 2018-12-20 22:50:45 The chow is 20% safflower oil and 22% sugars. The vendor calls it a "high fat diet for diabetes and obesity research". Think how many mouse diet researchers must be using this chow to make conclusions about macronutrients that are just garbage in, garbage out.

671 2018-12-20 22:49:18 If that were why he was doing it then we should claim war.  Trump is just dancing on the strings pulled by Putin right now so Putin can grab the oil areas and take them over and help Syria kill their own citizens.  So I agree with the law but not what is being done.

682 2018-12-20 22:48:32 J’ai fait un combo Vicks / Chilling oil mon torse est en PLS
683 2018-12-20 22:48:30 What if Machado says he will only sign if Kapler shares all his knowledge on the many uses of coconut oil?
684 2018-12-20 22:48:09 Greasier, too, as they usually dump olive oil on it. 

I had the best fish ever when in Chicago, never had a chance to try their pizza.

There is some great pizza in Toronto. Best I ever had was in a mall food court on Cape Breton Island. No longer there. :(
685 2018-12-20 22:48:00 It says in the GoFundMe he will give it to somebody in the Trump Administration. Which means, it all goes to Trump. He's the ultimate snake oil salesman who now doesn't even have to ride into town to take all their money.
686 2018-12-20 22:47:57 I got a oil change niggas turn on my AC

690 2018-12-20 22:47:31 How you end a conflict is more important? How in hell would any of these people know? We haven't ended a "conflict" in decades, for christ sake we are still at war with North Korea! Democrats and republicans are alike in a disturbing way, they both want middle east OIL.
691 2018-12-20 22:47:04 The day I get something besides the Pit Crew Oil Change Service at Walmart, you know I definitely made it.
692 2018-12-20 22:46:47 I like that typo. This isn't a democracy but as you say, a demoncracy. More years of oil and gas lobbyists gaming First Past the Post.
693 2018-12-20 22:46:40 You should wash it every other day. If you find you’re having excess oil, try dry shampoo! That helps me a lot
694 2018-12-20 22:46:38 They are oil too.  You want numbers?  Eli would be happy to supply
695 2018-12-20 22:46:35 She is an Arab moles whose aim is to destroy the UK just for Arab Oil money
696 2018-12-20 22:46:29 You eternal war neocons make me sick. Why do we care about the Middle East?? We have plenty of oil now. Why is Iran our enemy while Saudi Arabia ias a “vital” ally? The blood of Americans young is on your neocons hands. Bring. The boys home!
697 2018-12-20 22:46:27 Lawr and Steve were two of the most unique people I've ever met, but in completely different ways. They were both widely beloved, but together they were like oil and water (in a funny way).
698 2018-12-20 22:46:27 Does the airport security question you about your jojoba oil pen?
699 2018-12-20 22:46:20 I agree that lower oil helped in 2016 but they are not doing it on purpose this time.  Reality caught up to fundamentals.  Too many speculators traded oil....they had to be removed.
700 2018-12-20 22:46:20 Imagine what could be accomplished in this country if there were no political tribes and leaders worked together to create, advance, invent, etc. It's mind-boggling that 63 million Americans support tearing the country apart through a snake oil salesman who's lied to them 6,000 x
701 2018-12-20 22:46:17 To be true Malaysian, should we be part of all states? instead of Sarawakians for Sarawak only or Sabahan for Sabah only? I've friends  in oil gas industry in Terengganu who is from Sarawak and we welcome him with open hands. @NancyShukri @maszlee @abdulhadiawang

706 2018-12-20 22:45:20 No it means he’s going to usher us into peace leaving the Middle East which we have no reason to care about since we have plenty of oil now. Something obama never had the guts to do. Bring the boys home!
707 2018-12-20 22:45:16 I hear he is still offering his special snake oil. Should cheer you up.

709 2018-12-20 22:44:56 Hmmm... what would you consider to be confirmation?  Lookit the names on the trucks. 
It’d be odd for a truck in Nisku area not working in whole or in part in the oil and gas industry.  Park a car at Nisku truck stop, grab a meal, and listen.
710 2018-12-20 22:44:55 You go fight them Rukmini. 

Americans are sick of losing their sons and daughters over illegal wars fought for oil and greed.
711 2018-12-20 22:44:48 I'm tired of brown people and their countries being attacked and destroyed for bullshit reasons over and over. Oil being the main one.
712 2018-12-20 22:44:37 So basically I use one full avacado, 2 eggs (just whites), a touch of castor oil, & olive oil to get a good consistency. After it’s a thick paste I’ll add a tablespoon of the clay mask OR the activated charcoal. Leave on for 20 min under a processing cap
713 2018-12-20 22:44:34 Global oil demand is taking a leap off the deep end... is the global economy going to follow? We discuss - next!
714 2018-12-20 22:44:33 It's also funny that they want the pipes and oil to not be foreign connected. 50%is Alberta oil and the rest is from the US

718 2018-12-20 22:43:54 I got my weird oil based maker remover in my right eye and now I’m even more blind than usual. EVERYTHING IS BLURRY 
719 2018-12-20 22:43:39 Actually if you knew anything you'd know you pay less for Alberta oil
720 2018-12-20 22:43:37 Being an adult and getting my oil changed. I always find it so weird and I get a little anxious going by myself but you’ve got to do what you’ve got to do.
721 2018-12-20 22:43:35 They just needa be brushing that shit out with a wet brush and some oil
722 2018-12-20 22:43:33 Why do we care about the Middle East? We have plenty of oil now! Why is Iran our enemy? Why are we backing Saudi Arabia to counter the maybe less crazy Iran? Bring the boys home
723 2018-12-20 22:43:28 1 bottle of Tea Tree Oil cost $30! Bruh!
724 2018-12-20 22:43:27 Wonder if Santa can change oil and rotate tires...that’s what I really need
725 2018-12-20 22:43:21 The Japanese catch is eaten - the whales are properly used. Western whalers would take the oil and throw away the rest quite often. That said, this is to me like foie gras or something like that - people eat it but hardly in significant amounts
726 2018-12-20 22:43:14 Today I used a new dry shampoo since I woke up too late to look like a person and it MADE THINGS WORSE. And now it’s 5:42pm and I’m out here looking like I dipped my head in olive oil. 
727 2018-12-20 22:42:56 You can guarantee production but you can't guarantee that you're turning a profit when the cost of production isn't lower than what you can export the oil for. The crisis now would likely look even worse in a private economy because oil was a lynch pin whether private or public.
728 2018-12-20 22:42:54 Ugh I need an oil change. I gotta get married, fam.
729 2018-12-20 22:42:50 No, “Build Wall” is a racist 4chan meme. This is a dog whistle.
730 2018-12-20 22:42:50 Once in a while diet people invade my Twitter. Diets are rubbish.

Every food source on the planet has both good and bad effects on your body. Apart from maybe garlic and olive oil. Maybe.

Once you exaggerate, you harm yourself. Look for balance.

733 2018-12-20 22:42:16 Yes please! Will there be baby oil involved?
734 2018-12-20 22:42:06 Please share your numbers. Carbon budgets assumed; final energy demand by ~2050; % electricity; % nuclear by 2020/30/40/50; total capacity (TW); load factor; energy vectors; etc. As an engineer who used to design & commission oil platforms I like numbers & look forward to yours.
735 2018-12-20 22:42:01 Removing the trace solids from both substances is what raises the smoking point. But another thing I like is the way coconut oil seems to absorb less into the food.  But of course when I want that absorption, ghee is better.
736 2018-12-20 22:42:01 Are you aware that the US is no longer dependent on Arab and Russian oil reserves for our energy needs, Brain? And that we won't be for the foreseeable future? Get any Arab "campaign contributions," Brain? Is that why you're so down on the US? I'll wait...

739 2018-12-20 22:41:16 Then why is AOC antagonizing those who would help her take on Big Oil?
740 2018-12-20 22:41:14 Why then has @JustinTrudeau and @SohiAmarjeet said repeatedly that the twining would happen because it’s in the best interest of Canada? Why not just tell the truth? And why does Rachel Notley want to buy rail cars to get the oil to market if there’s no profit in doing so?
741 2018-12-20 22:41:01 MAGA’s done lit a match over an oil field
742 2018-12-20 22:41:00 to paralyze any economy who relies on it to thrive. Oil sales are 50% of Venezuela’s gross domestic product and 95% of its export revenue. You can imagine the damage that drop caused.
743 2018-12-20 22:40:55 Russia wants that oil at all costs including letting the gassing of citizens in Syria begin again and go on until he can take over the oil fields and then next comes more invasion of nearby countries
744 2018-12-20 22:40:45 right?? once you get over the oil cravings, it's pretty nice
745 2018-12-20 22:40:23 あ、猫…！と、遠回りしようぜ？
746 2018-12-20 22:40:21 Done
747 2018-12-20 22:40:21 If nobody eats it anymore why catch them? Do they use them for something else? I've heard they used to be used for lamp oil but I don't think that's the case anymore.

755 2018-12-20 22:39:40 How can you possibly fuck up an oil change lol.
756 2018-12-20 22:39:37 Nothing like being freshly shaved, lotion/oil’d up, and smelling good 
757 2018-12-20 22:39:31 They'll never pay  this right here killed Whistler and the mayor had to apologize! Why not look into products & companies that are better for the environment instead of targeting big oil. What about the company that has converted carbon into fuel, just outside of Vancouver.
758 2018-12-20 22:39:28 I'm sorry to inform you that Socialism isn't the reason for the Venezuelan crisis. Venezuela’s problems stem from corruption and egregious mismanagement especially when it came to oil, which was Venezuela's #1 export. The price dropped from $125 to $25 a barrel which is enough...

763 2018-12-20 22:39:04 As long as no one shuts down the oil wells in the US, let them have it.
Oil was the only useful thing coming from that area, and they're starting to run low on that.
764 2018-12-20 22:38:54 I told you before...Trudeau imports ZERO oil. ZERO. Call the Irving family about your issue.
765 2018-12-20 22:38:49 Found out what we got “paid” for our oil sales in November.  $5.98/bbl from one buyer and -$7.00/bbl from the other.  

Please do go on about how this stimulus is going to fix the problem.

In much the same way: I like my friends who are guys. I like having sex. I do not want to partake in gay sex.

But, by all means you do you, brother.
773 2018-12-20 22:37:42 Hey @MatthewRocco  as “Oil” is not a commodity. The price for oil has always been & will be controlled by the oil cartels & NOT market; that is an illusion you have come to accept.

785 2018-12-20 22:36:38 I don’t think that is the solution.  I think the Fed will start printing money to pay debt.  It will cause inflation of the US dollar.  It will be critical that world markets continue to price oil and other commodities in dollars to help hedge the inflation.  Reason why everyone

793 2018-12-20 22:35:45 @IngrahamAngle #Fed- Powell a lawyer. Fed liberal economists tell Powell inflation brewing and ignore oil crash.  Hopeless- Powell no idea about wealth effect.
794 2018-12-20 22:35:41 Yeah I’ve tried green olives and black olives and I do not like eating them. But I do love cooking dinner with olive oil. Especially sauté onion and chicken in a pan with garlic and Italian seasoning before I add Alfredo sauce!
795 2018-12-20 22:35:40 Honestly oil changes are soooo freaking expensive
796 2018-12-20 22:35:35 Pull up a chart of US oil production and tell me what the HS boom has to with Trump policy. Huge ramp and exports began long before this admin. It’s propaganda.
797 2018-12-20 22:35:34 What if Canada had spent $200bn on wind energy instead of oil?
798 2018-12-20 22:35:30 or maybe it's more like, Low oil prices are like a bucket of water thrown at the energy sector. It doesn't feel good at first. But the lower they are and the longer they stay down, the more thorough the cleansing.
The sector will come out of it fresher and healthier.

808 2018-12-20 22:34:31 CBD makes less on an impact than your average sleeping pill. As far as I'm concerned, most of what's sold is essentially snake oil. The only thing that's in any way credible is what's solid specifically for medical use.

811 2018-12-20 22:33:51 I remember while growing up, we had commercials like Saclux paints, Kotec motorcycle spare parts, Ogbuawa, AZ oil, cow bell and the rest running on national TV. What happened to those businesses? What happened to Minaj?

814 2018-12-20 22:33:26 Started watching the soccer doc "Sunderland 'til I Die" yesterday.

So many parallels with the Oil: glorious history, flash stadium, northern working class town, passionate & loyal fans. And on and especially off the field, a bumbling club that just can't get out of its own way.

819 2018-12-20 22:32:49 Everyone involved in Middle East Affairs wants the oil in Kurdistan.
820 2018-12-20 22:32:47 Tommy vietor the neocon! Bring the troops home! Why do we care about the Middle East? We have plenty of oil now
821 2018-12-20 22:32:47 This is total madness rising from insanity.  Russia now can take over the Syrian oil and keep gassing people.
822 2018-12-20 22:32:42 ~ Lashes and brows; apply castor oil to both your lashes and brows to grow them and make them thicker so you can keep it natural.
~ Curl your lashes; curling your lashes makes a big difference in your appearance making you look more awake as well.
823 2018-12-20 22:32:37 Oh, it's perfectly legal to GIVE your $ to a Con Man. It always has been. It's the CONNING that's illegal. But hey - by all means - pay the snake oil salesman.
824 2018-12-20 22:32:35 3/ Thats why Trump wanted out of the Iran deal. That deal was essentially a bribe to block Iran deals w/Russia.

Getting us out of Syria allows ISIS operatives to continue dealing in black market oil via Turkey and the Bosphorus Straight. Thats why Crimea is so vitally important.
825 2018-12-20 22:32:34 So do you think vlad will split all of that oil with him?  There can only be one king of the world
826 2018-12-20 22:32:28 i hate that the paper on the chiropractor table is like a huge oil blotting sheet. after being at work all day my greasy skin leaves a huge face print 
827 2018-12-20 22:32:17 Regurgitated propaganda from @OilGasCanada :
"Canada's oil and natural gas industry is committed to decreasing the  amount of GHG emissions generated for each barrel of oil and cubic metre of natural gas it produces."
...'Net' or 'Absolute' CO2 emissions are forecast to INCREASE.
828 2018-12-20 22:32:14 Why did you increase tax on petroleum products when the crude oil price came down?

830 2018-12-20 22:32:08 who the hell are the 2% that prefers foreign oil?
831 2018-12-20 22:32:06 Thanks - and really good question! In terms of value, oil is key - and trends in EVs are already set. I think we’ll hit a tipping point and markets will then move fast. Is there anything we can learn from what has happened to US coal companies?
832 2018-12-20 22:31:59 2/ Its all an oil and gas deal. 

Hillary took out Gadaffi before he could sell drilling rights to Putin and host a second Russian foreign naval base in the Mediterranean. Thats why Putin had it out for her and the Dems. He also wanted partnership w/Iran to form a new energy bloc
833 2018-12-20 22:31:58 Rs will be the minority. If #GOP cannot find fossil fuel sympathetic allies among the Democrats they will be outvoted. If 1 or 2 Dems bend to Oil & Gas interests the GOP rules by veto.
834 2018-12-20 22:31:57 Stone and the soil you're killing me killing me
Steam and the oil you're telling me telling me
835 2018-12-20 22:31:54 Also no oil so we will pass unless they have some coal mines we can fire up.
836 2018-12-20 22:31:46 trump is reshaping American military intervention.
no more endless foreign wars for *nothing* gained.

we are NOT 'Globocop' - and if the military is necessary
- we get *paid

remember when he said we should just *take* iraqs oil

this it pure trumpian - no more FREE protection
837 2018-12-20 22:31:33 “Oil”
838 2018-12-20 22:31:31 WTF?
839 2018-12-20 22:31:26 Bring the troops home! Why do we care about the Middle East?? We have plenty of oil now! America first!

842 2018-12-20 22:31:07 Lol
843 2018-12-20 22:30:53 Some people are to stupid to realize how much oil is integrated into every aspect of their life's........ Oil demand is growing and will continue to grow for longer than my life as well as my children's.
844 2018-12-20 22:30:50 So sad that all those people can be frightened enough to spend their welfare dollars on an un-necessary wall that will never be built, while making some snake oil salesman millions......
845 2018-12-20 22:30:47 I would tie you put to a poll and feed you baby oil

848 2018-12-20 22:30:08 Have they not tried a wee spray of 3-in-1 oil for the frictionless border?
849 2018-12-20 22:30:04 It's diluted with rapeseed oil
850 2018-12-20 22:29:47 Speaking of CBD oil, the absolute best. Pure, organic, no additives and priced right. @NuLeafNaturals
851 2018-12-20 22:29:46 We don’t need foreign oil. We have more oil and natural gas under our feet in Louisiana and Texas than anywhere in the world
852 2018-12-20 22:29:45 Canada produces more pollution each year. Justin wants to increase oil and gas production!
853 2018-12-20 22:29:45 I’m at the dealership waiting to get my oil change .... why my service advisor flirting with me ? 
854 2018-12-20 22:29:44 Oil and water don’t mix for a reason 
855 2018-12-20 22:29:34 Dude you are a riot  he said they were paying, and they aren't. He lied. Accept it boy, you got conned by a cheap snake oil salesman 
856 2018-12-20 22:29:33 The scum bag that dug up tweets from a 14 year old boy.
857 2018-12-20 22:29:22 I see that Trump is handing Syria over to Putin so Russian can have their own oil source.  Remember all the Russian troops and the gassing of Syrian children.  Russia is happy we are out despite Trumps claims they still pull his strings & make him dance

860 2018-12-20 22:29:05 So you don't think there is malicious intent at Greenpeace? They lie, deceive & slander #nuclear and Oil / Gas at every turn. Causing undue hardship on pipelines which (cheapest lowest CO2 emission transport). They are the most deceitful and malicious organization out there.
861 2018-12-20 22:29:04 It is difficult to deprive a man of his apocalypse without supplying a commensurately dire prospect. I hold up Zharkova for that, and the carbon drought for comic relief. Burn more oil or we all die.
862 2018-12-20 22:28:49 おはようございます
863 2018-12-20 22:28:49 I would say no to all of those even though it's an english car and quite possibly the only Jaguar that doesn't leak oil. $TSLA
864 2018-12-20 22:28:39 I once had one tweet me that criticizing them was nearly treason.

869 2018-12-20 22:28:15 I just left my car dealership for an oil change and was blasting Vanessa Williams Rise up Shepherd and follow. 

Everyone should be thankful for that.
870 2018-12-20 22:28:14 The only refineries receiving any appreciable amount of foreign oil are those in NB and NL. Irving in NB stated that it would not feel obliged to refine EE oil because that would involve spending billings on coking unit(s).
871 2018-12-20 22:28:12 Lower oil saved us from a recession in 2016 . They’re trying to do the same again here to prevent broader earnings collapse.

876 2018-12-20 22:27:26 Let's see.... Saudi Oil imports, sell Canadian Crude at under $20 a barrel, $10M to a terrorist,  hundreds of millions to outside Canada..... sorry Spencer, wake up an smell the coffee. This Country is betrayed every day.
877 2018-12-20 22:27:24 The Farm Bill is OFFICIALLY LAW!! 
CBD Oil is FEDERALLY LEGAL!!
878 2018-12-20 22:27:12 @RachelNotley Uneasy. They Are Losing Their Monopolies Oligopolies Of The Alberta Oil Industries. And Guaranteed Those Corporations.
879 2018-12-20 22:27:02 surprise, neither do you,  this is  not the eighties, there is  no quick fix or even a mediocre time fix unfortunately. Oil andf gas have been the mainstay of this Province for over 70 years and it will not change,, may look alittle different
880 2018-12-20 22:27:00 Good job as always - Especially happy to see the younger folks there helping out - it's crucial they be taught young that ALL people matter and deserve love and kindness.
881 2018-12-20 22:27:00 We definately need Energy East to replace foreign oil in our refineries.
882 2018-12-20 22:26:58 Not sure, is it a Tenergy Pluvi Ultrasonic Cool Mist Humidifier Essential Oil? 
883 2018-12-20 22:26:57 i love oils so much. have you ever tried tamanu oil? it's so thick and weird and earthy smelling but it turned me into a dewy princess.
884 2018-12-20 22:26:51 So what?   Where do you think oil comes from?  Fairies in the forests?  All of that stuff Brazil has in the stores comes from a world economy based on oil.  And the habitat collapse going on in Brasil comes from the same.  You ignore this issue.
885 2018-12-20 22:26:48 Oil price was much too high before 2008, much too much M3 was on the markets, run to China was fast, manipulation of oil prices, maybe Libor too, much other games, war in Irak and falling USD was unable to keep the bailed out house prices, payments up, as money was taken from US?
886 2018-12-20 22:26:21 @CNBCFastMoney BIG OIL IS A  CORRUPT TERRORIST SUPPORTING INDUSTRY.  DIVEST NOW WHILE YOU STILL CAN! @Tesla #ElectricVehicle #renewableenergy
887 2018-12-20 22:26:04 Anybody on here tried cbd oil? Thinking of tryin it for a while but apprehensive.
888 2018-12-20 22:26:00 Neem oil.
889 2018-12-20 22:25:58 Treated myself xtra nice: hair done, face mask, a long hot everything shower wit shea butter soap even gave myself a massage with lavender oil 
890 2018-12-20 22:25:51 Surrender:  that’s what you did for 8 years!  Trump strengthened the military, told Europeans to pay fair share, Merkel to stop buying oil from Putin, China to move forward, NOKO is dismantling.  You are embarrassment to America & used agency to spy on citizens you disagree with.
891 2018-12-20 22:25:41 Canada has and is investing in renewable energies let’s support the oil industry which can provide multi billions in revenue to pay for the green stuff “ budgets do not balance themselves “.
892 2018-12-20 22:25:22 I'm bouta start selling drugs on the side, doing oil changes,& start being a cwalking choreographer a nigga need a side hustle.
893 2018-12-20 22:25:16 Then why your country keep invading other countries to steal their oil?
894 2018-12-20 22:25:10 They couldn't strike a deal with T-Mobile in EU. That would be required to OTA a new dashboard, battery pack, body parts to protect the battery pack and new rear door emergency levers, which all are most probably required for homologation. It's Big Oil behind Big LTE.
895 2018-12-20 22:25:09 Former colonies. Talk to Britain for the first; Spain, oil industries & copper mining for the second. (Banana republics aren’t just about fruit.)

Greece? Look at the history of what the Nazis did to Greece, and how Greece didn’t get nearly what they should have afterwards.
896 2018-12-20 22:25:06 @RachelNotley To The Alberta Oil And Gas Industries Are Made From U.S. Big Oil Corporations. And E porting To Global Markets. Is Makin Them.
897 2018-12-20 22:25:04 Unfortunately theres a lot of false gossip and rumour about the Gurgani house (as the early Mughals called themselves) that orientalists peddled as genuine history. 

Mughal pietra dura work at its finest. steam would have made the flowers appear 3d.rose/amber oil for bathing etc
898 2018-12-20 22:24:43 Beautiful  
899 2018-12-20 22:24:42 I sell organic oil for hair/skin and black soap suitable for all skin types at very affordable prices, please RT and patronize thanks...
900 2018-12-20 22:24:40 they're not difficult to find. all you have to do is stop fucking with dudes who would rather spend all of their money on weed oil than something sentimental
901 2018-12-20 22:24:36 Tengri shall help you... The kurds had been used for the oil anyways..
902 2018-12-20 22:24:31 “A story isn't a charcoal sketch, where every stroke lies on the surface to be seen. It's an oil painting, filled with layers that the author must uncover so carefully to show its beauty.” Amelia Atwater-Rhodes

Beautiful description of stories.  They are incredible. #amwriting
903 2018-12-20 22:24:24 Trump decimated ISIS. When he took over ISIS had a Calipahte and controlled both Mosul and Raqqa and had a working govt with tax collectors and selling oil on the black market. Time to leave or maybe a family member of yours can finally serve in uniform
904 2018-12-20 22:24:18 @GreenARMY_La big oil refuse to close the canals
905 2018-12-20 22:24:17 Colorado town sued to stop oil company's drilling plan
906 2018-12-20 22:24:17 And then what?  Where will your oil come from to type such myopic positions on the internet?  As you face certain habitat collapse, you think these large nations and their militaries are just going to sit around  Climate change.  it's real.  Look it up.
907 2018-12-20 22:24:10 If you’d like to know where it really started, read “Lawrence in Arabia” by Scott Anderson, an excellent read about the partitioning of the Middle East by oil companies and the British Empire
908 2018-12-20 22:24:10 Republicans are bankrupting the US. National debt is $22T. Interest on the debt is $900B. The farm bill is $867 billion. The tax cuts will cost $2T. Ford & GM have lost $2B. GM’s laying off 14,000. $300B oil welfare. Lost retail jobs 100K. Car/real estate sales down $1M units.
909 2018-12-20 22:24:08 I realize Hubbert’s law would require production rates to fall as reserves continue to diminish so they won’t really be out of oil in 14 years. But this would indicate serious (near) future production decline in KSA.
910 2018-12-20 22:24:07 Fold in five liters of olive oil then bring to a boil.
911 2018-12-20 22:23:57 My oil leak is worse than expected buutttt its an easy fix
912 2018-12-20 22:23:57 I’m heartbroken, we both a dependency on fish oil supplements, and we were gonna beat it together!
913 2018-12-20 22:23:48 @CNBCFastMoney OIL DOWN BIG IS GREAT FOR 99% of Americans. Stop complaining and don't invest in terrorist supporting OIL INDUSTRY!
914 2018-12-20 22:23:29 @RachelNotley The Alberta Oil And Gas Industries. Supply The United States Markets. To 50% Of Their Petroleum Imports. It's No Small Deal.

918 2018-12-20 22:22:37 With oil at $50/bbl?? Not a chance!
919 2018-12-20 22:22:34 In case of oil, it may be the opposite is also true, in respect to 10% growth out of the US for 2019, with no cutting going on in the Mid-East or Russia....even with some demand growth, we're over-supplied with oil, Saudi's and Russians need to cut or get killed for 2019
920 2018-12-20 22:22:33 hemp was legalized today, including the stuff to make #cbdoil. i desperately need cbd oil and medical marijuana...but i'm in stupid #northcarolina, where they prefer #opiods over healthy treatments. i feel like other states have penicillin, but ours doesn't. can't move, either :(
921 2018-12-20 22:22:29 Fellow #Canadians: Could I ask a request of you? Could you please send me links, to documented cases of Trudeau, Butts, or any Liberal Party Member disparaging particular groups. i.e.: Gerry calling people Nazis and Justin intimating oil workers are predators. Thank you. #cdnpoli
922 2018-12-20 22:22:24 try peppermint oil on your temples and back of you neck/ head!!
923 2018-12-20 22:22:20 Thats why Trump wanted out of the Iran deal. That deal was essentially a bribe to block Iran deals w/Russia.

924 2018-12-20 22:22:17 Don’t worry & I want you to know that I’m not suffering from some underlying illness or sickness that healing oil can cure. So if you come to visit me, just bring your presence, peace & joy. Just 2 souls being present in our God’s image, spirit & mind.

926 2018-12-20 22:22:04 FRAUDSTERS IN POWER. 

1) Crude oil sales has yielded over N7 trillion.
2) FIRS remitted over N6 trillion.
3) Custom remitted over N1.5 trillion.
4) JAMB over N7.8 billion.
5) NIMASSA over N21.8 billion.
6) EFCC recovered loot over 500 billion.
927 2018-12-20 22:22:01 @RachelNotley Rachel. Dealing With The Alberta Oil And Gas Indusry May Be Difficult. With Making New Pipelines To Global Markets. Is Change.
928 2018-12-20 22:21:54 Furthermore, all the blather about EE serving refineries en route was just that. The Line 9B reversal has supplied refineries in ON with Western oil and at least 50% of the receipts of those in QC.
929 2018-12-20 22:21:54 More great news for the oil and gas industry.....NOT!!!!
930 2018-12-20 22:21:44 Yeah, I think it’s because of the oil
931 2018-12-20 22:21:41 The first oil rig will be named “Asbury Park Deep Water Murph”  AKA #JerseyIsToast
932 2018-12-20 22:21:34 My new favourite is Quorn smoky vegan ham fried in a little oil goes crispy and tastes really yummy, perfect facon (fake bacon) butty  x
933 2018-12-20 22:21:32 Fear of an economic slowdown is rocking Wall Street and the oil markets. The Dow briefly plunged below 23,000 on Thursday and the Nasdaq is flirting with a bear market. US oil prices plummeted more than 4% to the lowest level in more than 15 months.

935 2018-12-20 22:21:19 Fracking deep for oil
But there's nothing in the sump
There's kids all picking
Ar the garbage dumb
I'm running out of water
So I better prime the pump
I'm trying to stay sober
But I end up drunk
We'll be eating dirt
Living on the side of the road
There's some food for thought
936 2018-12-20 22:21:16 They are also a narco-communist organization—as well as being nomads from Iran looking to take property from people already living there. You neocons still out to build that pipeline? Better to ask how much big oil donated to you?
937 2018-12-20 22:21:14 Snake oil is perfectly legal, too.

Let 'em throw their money away at this inanity.
Maybe (not likely, but maybe) some of them will learn something about credulous gullibility.
938 2018-12-20 22:21:06 Pipelines to deliver oil further depressing the global price of oil? Or do you hope that by the time the pipelines are built America will be done dumping oil on the world market?
939 2018-12-20 22:20:50 Dollar and oil do have positive correlation rally's often (see say much of '18 to the top in oil). But your larger point is probably best.
940 2018-12-20 22:20:42 Just disgusting Poor Martha, time to head to Homegoods to buy my fancy ass Olive Oil
941 2018-12-20 22:20:27 This the difference having hair makes for a nigga damn i need to cop some more castor oil
942 2018-12-20 22:20:27 Just making sure I’m following this correctly. If KSA has 50 billion barrels in reserves and currently produces 10 mm bod, that means @ current production rates they run out oil in about 14 years?
943 2018-12-20 22:20:25 GM is capitalizing on the low oil prices now to make as much $ as possible while the getting is good. However, it’s insulting to know that surrounding the most productive plant in its Arsenal is all the electric and autonomous investment, it can all be built across the street.
944 2018-12-20 22:20:21 Look at the damage done by palm plantations for the oil used in them...Cadbury isn't allowed in my house

946 2018-12-20 22:20:11 I would get in an RV with Jeffrey Tambor and drive around an oil tank while filming.
947 2018-12-20 22:20:11 In times of falling oil prices, what impact has that had on costs?
948 2018-12-20 22:20:10 it's all about global strategy and oil.

950 2018-12-20 22:20:03 In the US , we have oil & gas companies. Most of the world , the governments own all minerals.  We have private property rights. All this fracking is being done on private property.
951 2018-12-20 22:20:02 it takes 17 million barrels of oil to make plastic bottles a year 
952 2018-12-20 22:20:01 Does this mean CBD oil will be legal in all 50 states?

954 2018-12-20 22:19:51 Yeah, I felt the same way when I was in North Dakota visiting my husband while he was in flight school. Whole state is obsessed with oil.

959 2018-12-20 22:19:26 I need to find some oil free facial moisturizers
960 2018-12-20 22:19:06 People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones. Canada's so-called #climate plan is a joke full of hot-air rhetoric and blatant hypocrisies, trying to pander to both sides at once but achieving neither. Build the pipelines NOW and sensibly and gradually shift off oil.
961 2018-12-20 22:19:00 My granny just made me lunch (w the sammich cut down the middle!), and my pawpaw just got my oil changed, washed + vacuumed my car, replaced the registration sticker AND filled the tank. Y’all niggers really expect me to go back to atx? tuhhh, delusional.

965 2018-12-20 22:18:41 Lindsey is always fighting a war in his head. I was involved in this nonsense in 1990. It’s about oil money. It’s about big business. And now the left want that war, too. Go ahead. Leave me out of it. #TheFive

967 2018-12-20 22:18:04 trying to learn more about fundamentals but why is the USD considered risky? given unemployment rate, Trade war ceasefire, interest Rate hikes, import/export numbers and even WTI oil is projected to gain strength
968 2018-12-20 22:18:02 Not the oil but the pipeline route to the Mediterranean and the EU market.
969 2018-12-20 22:17:55 Did you just say low oil price? Do you know how much FIRS has generated this year? Tell me how much is crud oil now Oga
970 2018-12-20 22:17:55 I am not interested in Scottish independence under the SNP. 
I won't be until they provide an actual detailed financial and economic plan for an independent Scotland that, unlike the White Paper, doesn't rely on historical distortion, nationalist sentiment and the word "oil".
971 2018-12-20 22:17:41 I ain't wear oil since october thats how u know I ain't have sex ina min
972 2018-12-20 22:17:34 I don’t trust those makeup baddies on Instagram that put oil paint on their face...
973 2018-12-20 22:17:32 i trusted walmart to change my oil and now I don’t know where my car is. bring her back.
974 2018-12-20 22:17:22 i think i get numb to all those holiday ones where it's a wishy washy beach and a seagull chucked in at the end, so I get surprised when I see one I like. I normally like quite heavy things like woodcuts or thick oil
975 2018-12-20 22:17:21 5.Alberta oil industry is the most significant industry in Canada. It's actually 2.5% of GDP.
I prefer to only speak for myself, but I suspect a lot of British Columbians regard you as dishonest whiners.
976 2018-12-20 22:17:11 Less oil & gas. Have any idea what it costs to drill a well in 15,000ft of water? Fracking is only commercial at $50 per barrel. Today it-closed at $57.59. Was in the upper $40’s today.
977 2018-12-20 22:17:01 To subconciously know when the oil is at the optimum temperature to successfully confit a ducks leg.
978 2018-12-20 22:17:01 @realDonaldTrump WE WANT TOTALLY  DEMOCRATIC, UNITED, PEACEFULL SYRIA AND IRAQ.

WE DONT NEED SOIL OR OIL.

979 2018-12-20 22:16:49 I like eating veggies but I don’t want to add oil to a majority of my meals... vegan recipes always have some oil
980 2018-12-20 22:16:44 It's hard to believe you're for paying $$ Billions to protect Saudi Arabia's oil tankers in the Persian Gulf!  Bring the U.S. Navy Fifth Fleet home!
981 2018-12-20 22:16:27 France and Britain did that mainly for the oil . America saw the benefit and joined
982 2018-12-20 22:16:23 its ok, i got most of the bad feelings out earlier this year. im just gonna cover myself in my chill pill oil, keep bundles of crystals on myself, maybe keep some whiskey nearby

985 2018-12-20 22:16:04 We currently have no pressing national security interest in the Middle East

We produce enough domestic oil to meet our national needs

988 2018-12-20 22:15:55 Am trying to find a logic behind  yemi kale statistic 
Why a consistent GDP growth led by non oil sector is adding unemployment. who are those aggregating the productions growth are they robots

996 2018-12-20 22:15:10 There is no excuse for new coal, gas or oil. The earth is already too hot. We are close to tipping points for out-of-control warming. The Australian and @BjornLomborg are #climatecriminals knowingly taking us to the edge of extinction. #climateemergency #eXtinctionRebellion

1003 2018-12-20 22:14:13 No, Irving didn't. It stated at the time that it would not feel obliged to refine EE oil. Remember, coking units cost billions.
1004 2018-12-20 22:14:12 I think they’re imagining The U.S army showing with a truck and fill it up with oil and then leave.
1005 2018-12-20 22:14:11 I don't know what the stupid libs think is going to power the world. Only oil and nuclear can do it  and they don't want either. Pure ignorance.
1006 2018-12-20 22:13:52 Isaiah 17. - destruction of Damascus   
Ezekiel 38 - Turkey, Russia and Iran ( also helped by Sudan and Libya) invade Israel from the north to take the spoils of the land which is currently oil and natural gas. Saudi’s watch in disdain but don’t help. Pay attention friend.
1007 2018-12-20 22:13:51 @thomhartmann. The oil in Kurdistan may be the motivation for the recent developments
1008 2018-12-20 22:13:44 He has plans with Russia Israel Saudi Arabia in real estate in redevelopment in Syria Yemen & Yes Gaza. It is all about oil control of water rights & the gulf ports
1009 2018-12-20 22:13:23 With regards to oil to tidewater please provide a solution other than "Trudeau fix this" because this is on BC and Quebec. They are stonewalling the projects and unless you want the federal government to overreach its constitutional authority they will not proceed.
1010 2018-12-20 22:13:23 baby oil
1011 2018-12-20 22:13:21 People are really overplaying this oil thing in general. Like real question who’d you rather influencing the area? Iran? Russia? Or keep it in the hands of a criminal dictator?  Like the whole other l thing started as a meme/joke now it’s treated as facts.
1012 2018-12-20 22:13:08 Of course they did... they are trying to make you look bad @elonmusk. You are a huge advocate for green and renewable energy, so by making you look bad, all companies doing that look bad.  This way oil and gas stay in power a bit longer.  Keep pushing back, dont give in to them.

1015 2018-12-20 22:12:36 Just dropped my car off at a local/independent/small business shop for an oil change and am hearing many things. Commence my first thread:
1016 2018-12-20 22:12:33 Less cash to give to extremists, less cash to buy arms to war upon neighbors, less cash to shore up the House of Saud. Works against all the oil state regimes (Iran, Qatar, Venezuela, Russia...)

1019 2018-12-20 22:12:20 I just see RNH take a pass on his back hand way too often. A lefty can still distribute the puck to the off hand wings and then the guy on the left side gets the option of the pass from 97. Ideally they'd both ne righties but the Oil just don't have a RD that can do it right now
1020 2018-12-20 22:12:12 Who’s tried to drink oil?  Why are you talking about damaged houses? That’s not the job of Congress.
1021 2018-12-20 22:12:10 What The Fuck, Fuck! Of the 2,000, a lot of the oil? For Americans, this is one of the great ports of the world.
1022 2018-12-20 22:12:04 So by Ur logic Trudeau is to blame for oil crisis in canada?

1024 2018-12-20 22:11:40 Fearing an indictment perhaps? You know you want to rub that oil all over your body.
1025 2018-12-20 22:11:37 ALEX’s LATEST PUMP & DUMP HAHAHAHAHA  Probably the most high risk oil play on the market. I’m surprised this was ever brought back from its death they might as well give the oil away to the dodgy country it comes. Not an investment so good luck with the PUMP & DUMP !!!  #GKP.
1026 2018-12-20 22:11:37 Expect Trump to oil quickly out of  the Afghan war
1027 2018-12-20 22:11:20 Time to live in the real world & know that you use oil products & you will for decades. Until you "boycott" oil products, you have no credibility.
1028 2018-12-20 22:11:16 Saw him leaving CBP with Kapler they were both having an intense discussion about the many uses of Coconut Oil
1029 2018-12-20 22:11:15 There is nothing that Trump won't sell to line his pockets or those of his cronies. Here's an idea: how about he drills for oil and gas just off the beaches at Mar-a-Lago?
1030 2018-12-20 22:11:11 Damn thing is leaking oil on me!!! Lol

1036 2018-12-20 22:10:56 Yes, you clearly are, as thinking this is about oil is monumentally incompetent. That's just conspiracy theory bullshit. I have no respect for people incapable of turning on their damn brains and analyzing complex issues.
1037 2018-12-20 22:10:55 I go in for just an oil change and sure enough these b****** come with the BS.

1048 2018-12-20 22:10:01 I certainly am concerned! the oil/ gas boom is nice, but at the end of the day, US demand is high enough that it is hard to see energy exports ever covering a large share of US manufacturing imports.   So still need to export other things (even with the offshore IP profits)
1049 2018-12-20 22:09:55 "Exxon Mobile and partner Imperial Oil have withdrawn their environmental assessment application." Talk to them. they don't see value in doing the assessment since there's not enough profit in it. We can either diversify our industry or throw the corps more money.
1050 2018-12-20 22:09:48 Well of course he is, not like our socialist premier, Rachel, killing us with her carbon tax, & suddenly pretending to like oil & gas. As if she’s fooling any clear thinking voters
1051 2018-12-20 22:09:45 Would love to catch a game some time at FirstEnergy Stadium. This week, though, I might prefer to be at Lucas Oil Stadium to watch the Giants take on Andrew Luck and the Colts 
1052 2018-12-20 22:09:32 @BillKristol so good to see you so solicitous regarding this Syria withdrawal. Puff the mighty neocon lives by the sea in a land called Gonilee. There will be a bloodbath, Syrians Kurds; the  middle east will belong to Putin and all its mf oil and Israel will have Iran up its ass
1053 2018-12-20 22:09:30 I love it when I come in for an oil change and they just do all this other extra stuff to my car for free
1054 2018-12-20 22:09:26 I'm going to go start a GFM now to put buckets of boiling oil and catapults on the wall now. We're gonna have us a good ol' fashioned castle stormin'
1055 2018-12-20 22:09:24 It's only a problem for Europe. The US and Canada have enough oil till we rid ourselves of the need.
1056 2018-12-20 22:09:16 You start with your oil, place a few politicians in, add a little scandal, a lot of denial, many donors, a lot of huff and puff with much bluff and you have the government.

1069 2018-12-20 22:08:05 What started this round of issues in France, was a US President playing around with the price of petrol, stopping Iran’s oil entering the market, scarring everyone until markets were destabilized, petrol prices went up. Now they have been dropping steadily, back to lower price.

1074 2018-12-20 22:07:49 Syria has 50 billion tons of undeclared shale oil reserves. Since 2006, the U.S. has implemented a plan to destabilize Syria in order to acquire private ownership of these reserves.

1082 2018-12-20 22:07:06 @realDonaldTrump if crude prices at under $46 a Barrell, and the US is EXPORTING oil, why in the HELL an I still paying almost 3 bucks a gallon?

1084 2018-12-20 22:06:50 the downstream effects were important in 15.  broadened the shock into the manufacturing sector so to speak.   capital equipment for oil exploration remains a strength of US industry (+ fracking uses a certain amount of steel).

1087 2018-12-20 22:06:25 Sirota did that recently...last week, I think. He highlighted Beto’s campaign contributions from “Oil and Gas industry,” falsely giving  impression that Beto was secretly a Big Oil rube, when contributions were from regular individuals who work in that industry. Sirota is a joke.
1088 2018-12-20 22:06:24 Agree re need for RCT pre-registration - outlined (I believe) long before @bengoldacre (No.6). Also re issues with guild-linked interventions - CBT especially. But imagine a world in which 90% of climatology academics oil company funded: their 'consensus' re global warming?

1094 2018-12-20 22:05:58 Water .... you can add essential oil if you want
1095 2018-12-20 22:05:55 But does he have the oil to break the yoke?
1096 2018-12-20 22:05:48 ふたりとも生きるのが不器用すぎんだよな～～～～～～～～～！しんどい
1097 2018-12-20 22:05:45 You should try rosehip oil
1098 2018-12-20 22:05:36 Bagdasarov said the U.S. withdrawal would leave massive oil reserves in Syria’s Deir ez-Zor province to fall under Russian control, and he said Trump’s decision was “a total dream come true.”

1100 2018-12-20 22:05:31 I'm sick too! It sucks, had to come home from work. 
What do you like to do when sick? I drink chocolate almond milk and apple juice and indica oil and do naps.
1101 2018-12-20 22:05:24 Because with the latter you can pretend that consumers will be protected from second order effects and just think of it as damaging oil companies. Gas taxes make the cost to consumers clear.
1102 2018-12-20 22:05:22 where is the cheapest place to get an oil change done?
1103 2018-12-20 22:05:18 I’m waiting for my oil change thinking of all the things I need to be doing.

1105 2018-12-20 22:05:06 You bet we will, Senator.  We will not give this up no matter how many tricks this criminal President plays to destroy our planet for money.  His massive greed will not do him any good in the end, nor will he reward Big Oil any longer for the damage they have done at our expense
1106 2018-12-20 22:05:04 Exactly. It isn’t “coordinated” in any sense of the word that makes any sense. And it’s much more than oil money donations. People are responding to learning that what they intuited about O’Rourke is true: he’s not very “progressive”. We’re FAR from ready to compromise on him now
1107 2018-12-20 22:04:57 Yes. He was happy with the oil and filter but I could tell the valve check was eating him up inside
1108 2018-12-20 22:04:53 Is there no limit to your obsequiousness towards Vladimir Putin? Treasons a better word. Bagdasarov said the U.S. withdrawal would leave massive oil reserves in Syria’s Deir ez-Zor province to fall under Russian control, and he said Trump’s decision was “a total dream come true.”

1112 2018-12-20 22:04:34 Because it isnt a part of any trade agreements. The idea of separating from canada is silly and very short sighted because when oil prices drop again Alberta will pull a Venezuela. But you know what you do you.

1116 2018-12-20 22:04:12 It's that, like those bad late night tv commercials, Trump made them think they wanted a wall! "Snake oil! Get your snake oil here! Cures all your ills and you will look so much younger and beautiful! Just look at Ivanka, Isn't she lovely!" & she sells you snake oil all the time!

1126 2018-12-20 22:03:25 The People of the United States are not behind the lies anymore.  Regime change, oil grabs, deep state intrigue and crime.  Our soldiers have no business there.  We are not under attack by ISIS.  Who funded them? We did and more.  We're on to you!!!
1127 2018-12-20 22:03:25 Keeping 20B sure, but Alberta separating will need to pay its share of the federal debt, will need to build it's own federal government (to handle foreign issues) will need to find a way to get its oil past a country it had just alienated and will be subject to base tariffs...
1128 2018-12-20 22:03:20 how sad is it going to be when all of the jungles of our world are cut, burnt and shredded just so we can have some fucking palm oil products.

1132 2018-12-20 22:03:00 Oil is renewable..."fossil?"  The issue here is your renewables are not reliable. So your "incentives" are not incentives because until a reliable source is provided you've achieved nothing except swapping efficiency for non efficiency. "For the sake of the planet."

1140 2018-12-20 22:01:47 I hear ya. Almost cost me the last two week. Arizona D scares me a bit. I’m sure which ever decision I make will be the wrong one but I’m leaning towards Trubisky.

1151 2018-12-20 22:00:29 You of all people should know that Putin is less of a threat than Brezhnev.  As long as oil prices remain low, he is deprived of the revenue he needs to represent a serious, destabilizing threat. Russia’s GDP is about the same as Mexico. Yawn..
1152 2018-12-20 22:00:28 Damn Goff has been killing me. Everywhere I look it’s close but I’d go Trubisky
1153 2018-12-20 22:00:25 December 20, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
1154 2018-12-20 22:00:23 Sounds great. Do you take a little tumeric oil and cheese the ginger root? Or do you mix it some how? Sorry, clearly not knowledgeable about this.
1155 2018-12-20 22:00:22 Yes but no meaningful progress will be made until we fix our system, big oil and other unclean energy still pull strings through super PACs
1156 2018-12-20 22:00:20 I got CBD oil today for all the depression-related pain I’ve had in my body and man it works
1157 2018-12-20 22:00:18 How about a big bottle of oil?
1158 2018-12-20 22:00:09 I will have chronic, severe pain for the rest of my life. I've been through the opiod trap,  I've tried PT,  OT,  chiropractor visits, alternative medications antidepressants and shots with steroids and not much relief was found.  Marijuana and CBD oil have. Go figure.
1159 2018-12-20 22:00:06 Happy birthday uncle mike! Just fixed an oil leak in my car and added some coolant + antifreeze so my car can probably make it to Pedro sometime soon if you’re around
1160 2018-12-20 21:59:52 In what way would you have more power to reach tidewater? You'd absolutely be worse in terms of getting your oil out of the province. You'd have less chance of getting it through Canada and if it was that easy to move it through the US, there wouldn't be a problem now.
1161 2018-12-20 21:59:50 It’s so annoying when you think it’s vegetarian and they don’t inform you that is it basically cooked in the same oil as the meat. Had this happen to me a few times

1165 2018-12-20 21:59:15 Yeah green energy in general is good for the economy. I just oil and gas interests who like you to believe it's not.
1166 2018-12-20 21:59:12 Eg an economy spends half it's income on oil ,oil price drops by half,the weighted basket does not react ,but 25 % of demand is released elsewhere .Petrol price is now roughly where it was 10 years ago ,how can it have caused Inflation/ deflation in the period ? 
Relative prices
1167 2018-12-20 21:59:07 Trump doesn’t want war with Iran despite his hawkish and moronic advisors desires. He just wants the same meaningless “win” he got in Korea. He doesn’t want high oil prices, American deaths and most importantly the terrible press.
1168 2018-12-20 21:58:58 I like the line “Watching the NDP act like champions of the oil industry is like watching a vegan try to run a steakhouse,” 

I think they believe people are falling for these ploys. I believe they are saying they promote oil, while sabotaging the industry and processes
1169 2018-12-20 21:58:57 You just gotta start tweeting adult things, like which cooking oil is better to make eggs or how angry you got tryna clean the vacuum filter
1170 2018-12-20 21:58:52 It's my pleasure sir.

1182 2018-12-20 21:57:33 We need to divest from oil with all due haste and find jobs in renewable energy for the displaced workers or we are all going to die. Simple as that.
1183 2018-12-20 21:57:30 Engine oil , Ororo or Olive oil?

1186 2018-12-20 21:57:22 As long as he drops oil price when Trump orders him, normalize with Zionist, and be a friend of White House's crown prince Jared, he is a "reformer" , who cares? .
1187 2018-12-20 21:57:21 Thanks bro
1188 2018-12-20 21:57:19 We are independent from their oil. Syria has always does business with Russia. 

What exactly is the purpose for us to be in the region?

Isis can be dealt with from the air

Millions can be saved as well as the lives of our troops

Can’t believe Trump had no advise on this
1189 2018-12-20 21:57:10 The problem with "voting with your wallet" is that the Koch Brothers, Bezos, the Waltons, Sheldon Adelson, Wall Street, Big Pharma, and Big Oil have... much bigger wallets.
1190 2018-12-20 21:56:47 He was a threat to banking and oil Zion cabal and they used America to defend "democracy" and take him down. Oil rich Venezuela is not obeying the Cabal so they must get a regime change soon....
1191 2018-12-20 21:56:45 Well explained! Thank you....
1192 2018-12-20 21:56:43 This is a great arguement for AB separation. It’s not just Trudeau we can’t trust but Canadian federalism. The $20B we will keep from the flawed transfer payment scam will be most welcome. BC and PQ demonstrably treat foreign oil better than their provincial “partners” anyway.
1193 2018-12-20 21:56:43 We're arguably already past tipping point in the UK, we've gone from 10% share to 30% in a decade and that will be difficult to reverse. America is completely fucked. Europe only has to deal with a corrupt car industry, US has an oil industry run by insane people.
1194 2018-12-20 21:56:41 Reports that Syrian government and SDF leadership start holding high-Level meetings to discuss the handover of the oil fields in the east of  Euphrates and deploying of Syrian army units to the Syrian-Turkish border to counter any Turkish threat
1195 2018-12-20 21:56:38 Ok... maybe it's flashing but just tell the   phone repairer what exactly happened he'll no what do sir.

1198 2018-12-20 21:56:22 When can you all work on making Marijuana legal on the federal level?  It would benefit chronic pain sufferers in so many way!!  I recently discovered the relief I've been searching for through marijuana and CBD oil.  But lost my takehomes because of it!

1209 2018-12-20 21:55:31 Why have I never tried CBD oil for my chronic nerve damage pain?!?!?!?
1210 2018-12-20 21:55:31 ISIS can't operate without money, somehow their convoys of stolen oil were allowed to travel all the way through Turkey, how was that allowed?  Trump has cut off their clandestine support, that's how he knows they have been defeated.
1211 2018-12-20 21:55:29 Mines been great... a slow oil leak that’s not problematic atm, not worth paying $3k to fix... when I can just add oil 
My only real complaint is the AC doesn’t seem ‘strong’ like it blows and it’s cold... but I never feeel like I’m instantly cool
1212 2018-12-20 21:55:28 I do oil, but if I had tree I sure would match you! Where you been? 
1213 2018-12-20 21:55:24 Really excited about this: I just used Lavender Oil and Ginger Oil in my homemade Berry Kombucha! I LOVE IT!

1229 2018-12-20 21:53:57 @McDonaldsCanada asked in DM but no #answer. are the fries at mcdonalsa vegetarian friendly? reading mixed reports that say they are fried in vegetable oil and others saying they are fried in oil with beef or pig tallow/lard ?
1230 2018-12-20 21:53:54 yes your work isis over. Your new work is ypg. the oil is now yours.
1231 2018-12-20 21:53:52 They fear Trump will use this to his advantage. He will fail. He will make it about himself instead of the SENSELESS DEATHS and LOOTING of OUR TREASURY for OIL and PROFIT.

1250 2018-12-20 21:51:49 On theother hand, I can see the benefit of having people not having any tie whatsoever to oil/gas, no matter how incidental.
1251 2018-12-20 21:51:46 That I’d rather fight a war to save the planet versus 80 years ago when our country & leaders fought wars to kill each other instead . If we can make positive change, let’s do it. No need to build muscle cars forever. Time to move on & leave coal & oil a bit behind, vs centre

1254 2018-12-20 21:51:26 LOL at this bloke. Saudi and Emirates would be nomadic desert tribes if not for the lottery win of sitting on oil - oil discovered by infidels, extracted by infidels, only made valuable because of infidel inventions like automobiles. Saudi and Gulf states invented nothing.

1262 2018-12-20 21:50:52 Probably not going to be a popular on the one hand thing here, but I'm guessing since donations are a form of speech, that's likely the reference. Plus, if I'm an individual who works in oil/gas and donates to me rep, it doesn't mean they're bought by oil/gas.

1268 2018-12-20 21:50:23 People don’t understand that oil industry execs are expected to contribute to campaigns. It’s part of the job. That’s why it’s federal law to report it in the first place.

1270 2018-12-20 21:50:10 Good for them! Meanwhile, out here on the BC coast, many dedicated, environmentally-conscious Canadians continue to fight for the survival of endangered, SARA-listed Southern Resident Killer Whales: A catastrophic marine oil spill from a #Transmountain tanker could wipe them out.

1293 2018-12-20 21:48:15 True, but it's also the global currency for trading in oil, etc.
1294 2018-12-20 21:48:11 I take it that the oil pipelines are more important then American lives. We have our own oil, why do you persist in us staying in Wars...

1299 2018-12-20 21:47:47 Add something oil and vinegar to the bread and some salt
1300 2018-12-20 21:47:44 But fighting climate change is *far* harder under First Past the Post, where oil lobbyists have more sway, so maybe today's climate change-derived wind is a warning. #pr4bc #bcpoli
1301 2018-12-20 21:47:39 Economy's rolling over but not going bust here.Lower 10yr rate more than offsets Fed hike.Lower oil also stimulative.We've just had big overreaction to Powell's bad decision.

1307 2018-12-20 21:46:52 Some other important factors to remember in this graph. The oil crises in 1973/74 and 1979 seem to be significant events. The banking crisis in 2008 is still affecting us too, it seems. I'd point to globalism as the real problem, unsurprisingly. But, the EU is part of that now.

1315 2018-12-20 21:46:14 It's funny how these clowns are attacking President Trump. He is not drilling for oil on them, and if they are shut down till we get a wall  it will be worth it.
1316 2018-12-20 21:46:10 So I’ve been at firestone for almost 3 hours and found out I need to replace 2 tires and repair 1... all I came in for was an oil change... lmaooooimcallingmydadooooo
1317 2018-12-20 21:46:03 Don't forget that he removed sanctions on oil and chrome for Putin on the same day.  He is completely owned by Putin - his very own little bitch.

1331 2018-12-20 21:44:29 The three teams that would land here would be the Coyotes, Hurricanes or Panthers. I’ve heard it’s somewhat of a split between the Canes and Yotes. Canes owner I believe is a friend of Fertita’s and is an oil guy either from Houston or has some other connection to the city.
1332 2018-12-20 21:44:26 No, we should be allowing them in considering we were the ones who destabilized their countries in the first place. You continue to support policies that create refugees. Maybe you need to go live under some US backed fruit/oil/mineral stooge and see if you don't try to leave
1333 2018-12-20 21:44:25 Sara, fo you know the difference between the terrorist PKK and our allies, the Iraqi Kurds?  Erdogan and his generals are in bed with the PKK's opium trade and oil smuggling via the Azaz Corridor.  Erdogan will not upset his PKK applecart.
1334 2018-12-20 21:44:22 Do people not realize how many ways he could make Mexico pay for that wall stop by withholding foreign aid until it’s paid for, tariffs, subtract a dollar a barrel off of the oil we buy from them nobody thought they were ever going to write a check for it

With the dwindling fortunes from the oil rents, our dependence on the oil rents to diversify the economy, high recurrent expenditure etc
1338 2018-12-20 21:44:07 The oil funded media can’t admit that publicly

1340 2018-12-20 21:43:54 That and they’re flaring fat beyond limits to get oil out.  Lynn also mentioned that.  Currently at 20.5% on new 12% limits on non state land.  Pathetic.
1341 2018-12-20 21:43:48 Do you go to a dealership for your oil change?
1342 2018-12-20 21:43:44 We should move on from an oil paradigm, develop green energy. Otherwise it won’t matter who controls it because we won’t have a planet to live on anyway.

TRUMP IS A COWARD WHO WILL BE IMPEACHED.
1345 2018-12-20 21:43:15 Since Scotland is part of the UK, the debt belongs to people in Scotland too, just like Wales, NI or England. You are very naive if you think Scotland could walk away with the oil yet tell the rest of the UK they can keep all the debt. Very naive indeed.

Cuz Trump hate trumps all

These people, Leftists, media...are just hate filled, bitter lunatics
1362 2018-12-20 21:42:03 Ok connected.
1. EM and bank performance looked good.
2. Why is January VX letting VIX get this far ahead?
3. Marke would have had a better chance this morning if oil wasn’t getting smoked again.
4. I’m not taking side on Powell. Markets were already getting crushed.
1363 2018-12-20 21:41:58 The oil market is down all over the world, right? It’s super smart to phase out it only in Canada.

The kind of progressive brain we have to deal with nowadays...
1364 2018-12-20 21:41:55 This guy was just convicted right? He put them in oil wells or something cruel like that. And these females want to love him and bring him joy??

1369 2018-12-20 21:41:40 James, and in my opinion - this is an organization to promote its economic interests. For example, having bombed Iraq, Libya, they got access to oil. But also a large number of refugees to Europe.
1370 2018-12-20 21:41:39 Lynn Helms said this after October record.
The record could be short-lived, says Lynn Helms, the state's top oil and gas regulator, who expects investment in drilling, hydraulic fracturing and well completions to decline at least through April 2019.

1377 2018-12-20 21:40:51 I think I went overboard on the holiday scents in my home. I went and bought four wall plugs with four different scents in all of them.  I also plugged in an oil burner with two different candles burning. My dog won’t stop sneezing. I know she’s sick of me...

1405 2018-12-20 21:39:01 The fact is the global glut of oil is going to drive down margins. That's what happens when you're in a battle for market share. Which is where the US is. And they have more infrastructure and lower production costs. So they're going to win. The writing is on the wall.
1406 2018-12-20 21:38:57 If Jill Stein can steal money from the left with a GoFundMe, this is cake for a pro snake oil salesman like Trump. Step right up! #GoFundTheWall

1412 2018-12-20 21:38:31 It’s because Trump doesn’t believe the world is heading towards an environmental disaster and sees the loss of oil revenue as more important.  I have no doubt that EVs will be taxed to death.
1413 2018-12-20 21:38:25 i don't think that cashews can actually be grown in large enough quantities that they are able to sell "real" ones in stores, im pretty sure theyre just whey protein made into a solid mass with olive oil

He also bugged delegates in Copenhagen, sabotaging the conference, & supported a coup against the Left in Brazil that led to fascists threatening the Amazon.

1437 2018-12-20 21:36:11 We’ll have to transition from oil eventually. But I’m not talking about that. I’m talking about mitigating thenimpacts of climate change. It doesn’t matter if you believe the science, it’s happening and we have to respond.
1438 2018-12-20 21:36:08 In a nutshell that is the major issue that the man made climate change snake oil salesmen have . NONE of the doomsday prophecies are coming true . Polar bears thriving , Pacific islands growing etc etc . What a load of bollocks from so called scientists

1491 2018-12-20 21:31:27 I wouldn't do them in olive oil either Alistair
1492 2018-12-20 21:31:25 Ohh I’ll definitely look into it! Yeah I’ve yet to find anything to help keep the oil down when I straighten it.
1493 2018-12-20 21:31:18 When the oil well license is revoked from you guys....you will become his number one enemy
1494 2018-12-20 21:31:05 Typical stupidity. I am a female and l am treated like a queen. Another dumb idea is oil running out; it's welling up like crazy, every hole we dig oil bursts up. And Saudi Arabia, FYl, is a pennesula; full of wells and surrounded by desalination plants. Wisen up.
1495 2018-12-20 21:30:57 Have you tried putting on oil/moisturizer before you beat your face sis?

1497 2018-12-20 21:30:53 I'm from the east coast and there is plenty of culture there. Culture isn't just what someone does for a living but a way of life and how they speak, act, engage and treat one another. What is Alberta's Culture that isn't true right across Canada? Oil? Is Oil a culture?

1500 2018-12-20 21:30:46 Not abt Dems/GOP, it;'s abt stupid & smart. Smart ppl knw tht many fraudulent GFM accounts r set up by con artists preying on ppl wth good intentions. Sort of like naive ppl tht send $ to snake oil selling televangelists. If u wnt to make a diff bug the Hell out of ur state reps
1501 2018-12-20 21:30:37 Olive oil or your thickest lotion, get as much as you can wiped off, witch hazel or rubbing alcohol to get the last of the color off. BUT extra chapstick when all is said and done.

1505 2018-12-20 21:30:25 It imported a lot of its oil and gas in 2015 but since then the Corrib gas field has come one line reducing our dependency.
1506 2018-12-20 21:30:25 Young me, watching westerns with my grandfather: How would a snake oil salesman even be able to earn a living? These claims are ridiculous, and no one person, much less a whole town, could possibly believe them.

Me, in 2018: Oh. Got it.
1507 2018-12-20 21:30:16 おはよう、オリーブ推しの皆さん。今日はもこちゃん使ってくれるかな。
1508 2018-12-20 21:30:01 Bake some garlic cloves until they're soft. Then squeeze out the soft garlic and mash them into the potato with a little olive oil. 
1509 2018-12-20 21:30:00 There's got to be a smart way to convince the companies making this stuff that their future growth isn't tied to making ever more of this stuff. Much in the same way that we need to convince the oil companies that that making ever more fossil fuels isn't the only way.
1510 2018-12-20 21:29:55 Interesting market for oil. Currently doing analysis on $PXD, $OXY and $ECA. Looking for companies that have the best land and minimal debt.
1511 2018-12-20 21:29:51 Well, that's perfect when the oil & gas famine hits - everyone can eat potatoes.
1512 2018-12-20 21:29:48 What a moron. If he really gave a crap about the Saudi's he'd build the pipeline and tariff Saudi oil. He's doing their bidding pretending he's standing up to them. Embarrassing. #cdnpoli
1513 2018-12-20 21:29:48 Workers earn more, no sales tax, incompetent oil businesses and squandered their Heritage Fund. It’s all Justin’s fault!
1514 2018-12-20 21:29:45 ...I thought you said we "defeated ISIS". Ya know. Like when you said NK was "no longer a nuclear threat." 

How people buy the snake oil you sell is beyond me.
1515 2018-12-20 21:29:44 How much do you know him? His 2nd name is embezzlement, in case you didn’t know. He embezzled as governor. He headed Abacha’s cash cow & came out to tell us Abacha didn’t steal. He took $3b 2 find oil in Lake Chad, $1b to fight BH, list is endless! Don’t mock yourself, my friend

1. Gut healthcare, including the pre-existing conditions statute.
2. Keep gerrymandering in place.

So R voters: when you lose your health insurance or your livelihood from oil spills, remember that you voted for this.
1519 2018-12-20 21:29:15 Trump agency takes major step toward Arctic refuge oil drilling: The Trump administration will take a major step toward… @environmentguru
1520 2018-12-20 21:28:49 But I agree.  I know a ton of fantastic people in the industry that are very worried, and justifiably so.  If I worked in oil and gas I would for sure be looking at additional training or alternatives to protect myself.

1522 2018-12-20 21:28:48 I’m at an Islington restaurant and the guy next to me has been talking about his “philosophy” on saturated fats (something about coconut oil) —someone needs to come and rescue his date right now.

1528 2018-12-20 21:28:32 Still waiting for yours.  

Any simpleton can implement a tax increase, that's not a plan.
Meanwhile:

  ·  You still sanction the dumping of raw sewage into our waterways
  ·  You still import Saudi oil while putting up barriers to Canadian energy
  
You are a fraud.
1529 2018-12-20 21:28:31 And oil company subsidies. (Ethanol)
1530 2018-12-20 21:27:54 Exxon cant do the right thing ALL BY ITSELF? The World's largest Oil Company?
1531 2018-12-20 21:27:40 You are destroying West Texas just to drill and frack the hell out of a fragile ecosystem with limited water supply. Then, you export the oil out of US.
1532 2018-12-20 21:27:35 I love robotic oil poffins~!
1533 2018-12-20 21:27:30 I think you get offended. I was just asking what was local price at times oil tanked to$30/bbl. if 30/bbl for very brief for how long the 46/bbl is sustaining? Lastly, oil prices doesn’t change during the month it always changes on month end.
1534 2018-12-20 21:27:20 But gas prices continue to increase. America’s oil producers want more ... enough is never enough. They also didn’t need, or deserve, the $1.9 trillion, which trump & the GOP plan on paying for by gutting Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, which was bought and paid for.
1535 2018-12-20 21:27:20 Guess again. Man City are doing your @ by spending oil money mate
1536 2018-12-20 21:27:18 You’re going with goose fat alone or in combination with oil? I need to up my spuds game this year.

1539 2018-12-20 21:26:59 In the old days they would pour hot oil on the ladder user. We need to come up with a modern way to discourage this activity.

Bush fucked that up, with his pro-oil bullshit.
Huh, there may be hope 4U yet

1550 2018-12-20 21:25:46 Aren't there subsidies that could be slashed? Oil companies, Walmart...
1551 2018-12-20 21:25:35 The problem is if the main polluters, like China, don't do anything, putting it all on countries like the U.S. & Canada won't do much good. Green energy simply can't replace oil & gas. I'm more interested in making oil & gas more eco friendly.
1552 2018-12-20 21:25:23 If you kill Dil this dilmas is gonna be so sad. Don't kill him on Christmas, wait till the next year at least.
1553 2018-12-20 21:25:10 Why did @realDonaldTrump wake up & Tweet withdraw from Syria w/out informing DoD or State? Who benefits? Russia Who gets destroyed? The Kurds helping us in Iraq & Syria. Who does that help? Saudi's as oil price freefalls. All the oil in Iraq is in the north controlled by Kurds.
1554 2018-12-20 21:25:04 The ECA that GEJ saved from short oil boom that @MBuhari and @APCNigeria claim that PDP did not save any money is what Buhari/ APC have plundered under 3 yrs.
1555 2018-12-20 21:24:57 This would be a very smart time for Trump to announced he’s buying oil (abt these prices) for the strategic reserve. It might help calm global markets. #oil #potus #opec

1557 2018-12-20 21:24:48 Exxon and Imperial are not part of the big oil industry? Huh!

If someones next move is blaming Trudeau for not diversifying the Canadian markets over the past 30 years, I've heard it already.
1558 2018-12-20 21:24:43 The oil movement is a strong indicator for me
1559 2018-12-20 21:24:35 No it isnt, and you are smoking to much dope if you think it is doing anything to stop Russia or Iran. American troops need to come home, there is no reason to protect oil that does our economy no good when we have criminals walking acrossed open borders
1560 2018-12-20 21:24:33 My sis let me put you on! Massage castor oil in your hair like deep conditioning and then wash it out and continue this routine. Your hair will grow longer and thicker
1561 2018-12-20 21:24:23 Russia isn't strong enough militarily or economically for a protracted presence in the Middle East, where money is burned at an alarming rate.

Best Russia can hope for is making  a few  arms deals & keeping Iran from blowing up the Region.

Russia doesn't need any Oil & Gas.
1562 2018-12-20 21:24:20 How about we stop spending trillions invading and destroying other countries so our oil, pharmaceutical and mineral corporations can steal other countries assets
1563 2018-12-20 21:24:14 I haven't seen anyone suggest hypnotherapy, but it's something to look into at least. For some people, it's possible to undergo hypnosis and clean your memories. Also, CBD oil may be helpful to reduce anxiety of you don't already use that.

Make reference to Barack's initial campaign promise that included pushing "plug-in hybrids".

1582 2018-12-20 21:22:15 Oil will be taken out of the ground and brought to market like it or not.  Suddenly Alberta's so called "dirty" oil looks a lot safer.  lol.

Their "Deep roast" tastes like generic burnt food with the texture of fine sand and a hint of peanut. Also: It seems the oil wants to separate out because the bits of peanuts are to burnt to form a "butter".

1611 2018-12-20 21:19:48 Red-haired daughter was told by a friend that she should use coconut oil instead of sunblock, because of the carcinogens in sunblock. Daughter said, "Well, you know what else is carcinogenic? The SUN." (I'm agnostic about most of that stuff, for the record. But she's not).

1615 2018-12-20 21:19:24 How does it help Russia? If Kurds do not surrender 2 Assad, Turkey will annex NE Syria the way they annexed NW Syria. Assad cannot afford 2 lose that rich oil and farmland. Not very likely Kurds will surrender 2 Assad. Russian ally, Syria, damaged. US ally, Turkey, strengthened.

1621 2018-12-20 21:18:45 So other hole of my nose is clogged due to colds and I tried putting some across oil on both but oh boy mas lumala Now I cant breath on both
1622 2018-12-20 21:18:43 Thank you!  which products did you use from that range? Or was it just the oil?
1623 2018-12-20 21:18:41 so fun when you write a nice and detailed shopping list, then forget to take it to the store, and get to see what slipped your mind. (olive oil. running out of that is an actual crisis.)

1625 2018-12-20 21:18:21 if someone with a disability is telling you about their symptoms one thing you shouldnt do is suggest yoga, meditation or cbd oil as a cure to all of their ailments. like i cant fucking fix my brain with weed oil you jerk
1626 2018-12-20 21:18:09 That's another thing that's just filthy stinkin' rich... "been used by virtually ever culture throughout recorded history"...so has torture, killing, etc. I say that not to equate the two but the mindset. Cannabisd olive oil?  New one.  Wasn't smoking the wacky weed.

1632 2018-12-20 21:17:15 #RRE And most dont realise  50% of a production is gas and 25% oil hedged at $68 - Think if oil prices stay low might be better for rre to pick up a few assets
1633 2018-12-20 21:17:13 Agree very much as I've been denoting in reports to clients. Oil, yuan weakening prior to China stimulus package, European political environment etc.
1634 2018-12-20 21:16:49 Got ripped off by Craggs last time and this was a much better deal but only a good deal if you actually get the oil

so.
1639 2018-12-20 21:16:33 I donate to St. Jude on regular basis. I shouldn’t and neither should you, but they need help.

Our government has money for corporate handouts, trillion-dollar wars, oil subsidies and tax break for the super rich but someone we can’t afford healthcare.

We need to demand change!
1640 2018-12-20 21:16:29 Only me would forget to get a oil change and blow my engine 
1641 2018-12-20 21:16:22 Oil stinks aswell! You smell of it for days
1642 2018-12-20 21:16:22 Check your Engine oil this afternoon.
1643 2018-12-20 21:16:18 Following this monumental victory of federal #hemp farming legalization in the U.S., Dr. Bronner's will soon begin sourcing the organic hemp oil used in our products from American farmers.
1644 2018-12-20 21:16:16 Ladies, the oil that be on y’all hands after ya get a manicure be mad sexy to me 
1645 2018-12-20 21:16:15 @WoodyHarrelson I bought and just received a 1 oz bottle of 1000 mg CBD oil. The brand is Whole Greens.
Is that really your stuff?
How much should I take?
1646 2018-12-20 21:16:08 As it stands our Gov owns all property. It's called  Eminent domain & it is used in NYC, & nation wide, frequently. Ppl only own the house not the property & if they own property it is only the top layer; minerals/oil are US property can be mined as needed w/o consent.
1647 2018-12-20 21:16:03 next time i go to a strip club i’m bringing a big ass bottle of lotion with oil in it cause y’all do not lotion the back of y’all legs y’all booty or backs  
1648 2018-12-20 21:16:00 You sold out the American People in favor of Big Gas & Oil, Mining Interests & Big Timber. You've denied Climate Change & insisted the Idiot Liar in the White House knows what he's talking about by going along with raking the forest floor to prevent deadly wildfires.Good Riddance
1649 2018-12-20 21:15:53 oil is $46 today, 

 $40- $50 is 'fair value' to keep the oil companies afloat, true value is around $25 (based on BP false reserves years ago)

1650 2018-12-20 21:15:46 Just like Social Security? I’m sure the oil and gas companies won’t pass these costs onto the consumer, right? It’s a boondoggle replete with fallacies. Dividend?! Taking money from people w/o their consent and giving it back under vague terms feels like yet another gov’t scam.
1651 2018-12-20 21:15:34 Show the facts that the world doesn’t have enough plants and trees?
Then go check number of trees planted by the oil field and number of trees planted by green peace

1653 2018-12-20 21:15:33 Whether in the hands of the private sector or the government, if there is no profit to be found in the production of oil then their economy would have collapsed. The corruption that followed is no different from corruption anywhere else be it the United States or Saudi Arabia.
1654 2018-12-20 21:15:29 After all the years in government bondage, HEMP has been set free! CBD oil will be manufactured all over America and we hope to make it affordable to all!!

1656 2018-12-20 21:15:17 Just had some scratchings with three modest statements on the packet. Great Taste - Awesome Flavour - Perfectly Salted. Actually, the overwhelming flavour was of the oil they were cooked in being overused. Nil points Snaffling Pig Co

1659 2018-12-20 21:15:03 It is quite unfortunate for Sudanese Citizens to have demonstrated while Dr. Bashir was trying his best to revive their already collapsed economy by taking away 50% of our oil. #Nhialjunubyenakan.
1660 2018-12-20 21:14:57 Oil is crashing, so the OEA is coming for a personal income tax increase next.
1661 2018-12-20 21:14:56 #Volatility gripped financial markets a day after the Federal Reserve @federalreserve sent shock waves across assets, with the rising threat of a government #shutdown adding to a litany of concerns buffeting equities. The $USD sank with crude #oil!

1663 2018-12-20 21:14:38 But its about pipelines so it is O.k, Yup totally won be over, so much that to show solidarity every time I see a flat bed carrying oil field equipment or a diversified bus full of people heading out to one of the sites, I am going to straddle both lanes and slow to 5km/h
1664 2018-12-20 21:14:36 Q is an American Patriot and so are you. And some of the shit you peddle puts you right in there with snake and the oil. Britain might could use some of your incredulous pontificating about right now. Sit down and we will call you when your needed.
1665 2018-12-20 21:14:27 I am from Zim...i can do this for 2 litres of cooking oil.
1666 2018-12-20 21:14:24 I’ve seen a drone close up on the beach when it was being launched to video along the coast. It certainly didn’t look big enough to close a whole airport. They could have sent a soldier up in an ultralight to shoot it down or pour oil into it to clogg the workings. Whitewash next
1667 2018-12-20 21:14:17 Beard Oil eh.
1668 2018-12-20 21:14:06 If you want to rein in the Saudi's, frack them to death. Dropping the price of oil restrains their already dire cash flow problem
1669 2018-12-20 21:14:04 Because neocons can't keep their grimy hands off the middle east. I'm disappointed that we continue a cycle of endless violence for oil, and fighting the wars of other countries. Don't even get me started on the 38bil for Israel while our Wall isn't even finished yet.
1670 2018-12-20 21:13:38 I’m just trying to make it for an oil change 
1671 2018-12-20 21:13:33 Oil prices dropping, wait for someone to remind us about the Senate chastising Saudi Arabia

1675 2018-12-20 21:13:08 Those saying the price of oil falling is a negative are doing so w/o factoring in fall in speculative effect of herd. Worrying about oil in $40’s/barrel is a waste of time, the speculation on “Business” networks is quite vacuous.
1676 2018-12-20 21:13:07 i reproduce an intimate soft shoe shuffle to make you purchase palm oil
1677 2018-12-20 21:13:04 please tell me you got hot oil
1678 2018-12-20 21:12:55 U love the Saudi's!  Two faced monster. It is based on greed. With all the oil we get out of America, why do we need anything from any Eastern freaks. I mean, u are buds with the murdering Prince. U only like wealthy powerful crooks to be your phoney pals. They r our enemys dumby
1679 2018-12-20 21:12:50 Ooh ouch. I'm hurt. I would expect no better from someone who probably beats his wife. When your oil runs out you'll be buying water from me, pal.
1680 2018-12-20 21:12:49 I posted the same thing , I’ve been told vitamin E oil
1681 2018-12-20 21:12:39 It may even be a conspiracy generated by the petrochemical companies themselves. Eazy justification for incresed prices and expensive alternatives. How much oil/gas/coal is really left i wonder?
1682 2018-12-20 21:12:36  I may have shouted for joy and frightened my children when I saw this announcement!I

CBD oil with the Seed-to-Seal guarantee!  Next month!!!
1683 2018-12-20 21:12:19 Yes, I'll rally a mob with pitchforks and torches to round up our politicians of the crime of oil refining.
1684 2018-12-20 21:12:16 So 1) you have too much oil, 2) you’re worried about demand... what’s a solution for both? Well in early 2016 the answer was $30 #Oil price.. just saying... #Opec #OOTT
1685 2018-12-20 21:12:10 True but multiply 60% (35 % deval + 25% duties) with PMLN base price and compare. Secondly, prices changes every month end. So compare when month close. Lastly during PMLN time oil prices rocked to $28/bbl what was the retail price at that time?
1686 2018-12-20 21:12:09 Hate to say it, but oil isn’t the future nor are railcars or pipelines. Alternative energy aside, Alberta needs to build infrastructure domestically. Who are the real losers here? Corporate $ & foreign investors. Let’s put Alberta in Albertan’s hands through empowerment.

1691 2018-12-20 21:11:44 Spam. Egg. Rice. Soy sauce. Sesame oil.
1692 2018-12-20 21:11:41 Statistically, the global growth slowdown looks almost identical to that of 2011-12 and 2014-15 and with largely the same forces as 2014-15, China weakness, Europe and Oil price plummet. That the parallel isn’t noticed I like.
1693 2018-12-20 21:11:41 All I'm saying is oil boiler.
1694 2018-12-20 21:11:35 If you carry an apologetics bible, apple crown, and coconut oil in your purse just go ahead and put in an application to be a part of my family.
1695 2018-12-20 21:11:34 Keep some good fats in your diet. Almonds, walnuts, olive oil, and avocado.
1696 2018-12-20 21:11:27 Getting sick and tired of Albertans complaining about having no pipeline for their tar sands oil. The inconvenient truth is that for the sake of the climate that stuff needs to stay in the ground.
1697 2018-12-20 21:11:22 Tar Sands bitumen is dirtiest cheapest, least profitable oil. NO one wants to invest in new Refineries for it.  FFS accept Reality!
Then work together -
1698 2018-12-20 21:11:03 Why is the vitriol directed at the oil companies, who have made record profits. Why didn’t they build refineries & pipelines when the things were booming.
1699 2018-12-20 21:11:01 Finally getting an oil change on my car.....
1700 2018-12-20 21:10:52 I’m speaking strictly of marijuana, an all-natural substance that has been used by virtually every culture throughout recorded history. Jesus’ “annoiting oil”? Cannabis-infused olive oil, according to a theology professor at NYU.
1701 2018-12-20 21:10:27 Elon Musk on hydrogen fuel.
 Big oil will manufacture H2 as a by-product of fracking and methane harvesting which will directly contribute to carbon being shed into the atmosphere. H2 will yield poorer performance than pure electric battery vehicles. It will not help civilization

1706 2018-12-20 21:09:47 I'm not saying that but when companies no longer get bailouts. They shut their doors . And Canada is more than just oil. We have other resources. And finding the generation coming into adulthood are changing how they feel . They want greener energy

No need to train oil workers for renewable energy sources that don’t exist - especially when their scope should be expanding.

1726 2018-12-20 21:08:11 Yeah, GOOP’s whole thing is selling snake oil garbage. She’s astoundingly out of touch with any aspect of real life and clearly couldn’t care less so long as she profits from t.
1727 2018-12-20 21:08:02 Keep an eye on oil futures.
1728 2018-12-20 21:08:00 If anyone actually thought that your intentions here were actually to bring our troops home, we would probably be behind you. But since we know that your only intent with this move, is to give Putin control of Syria's oil supply. Nobody is buying it.
1729 2018-12-20 21:07:54 While it is true that gas prices of gone down, that is directly related to the falling price in oil, which the President does not control. (And yes, that means if oil prices go up it is not his fault.)  Supply and demand!
1730 2018-12-20 21:07:53 Hey Ms. Newbie from Florida.  We actually prefer our gas prices quite a bit higher.  Lower gas (oil) prices adversely affects crootin .
1731 2018-12-20 21:07:50 You will probably never be able to buy big oil, banks and Apple this cheap again.
1732 2018-12-20 21:07:47 According to this website I use, I'm getting them from: tilapia, 1% fat dairy milk, olive oil, chicken breast, dry roasted peanuts, dry roasted almonds, and cooked garlic, all in microscopic amounts each. They just add up.
1733 2018-12-20 21:07:46 There is a tsunami of oil coming......
1734 2018-12-20 21:07:43 You have assumed everything about me and my knowledge of the situation., you have deflected and got angry at oil whereas never reading the other side. You are a hypocrite you live in an oil world with your oil-based products and yet call it evil.
1735 2018-12-20 21:07:27 El Chapo used oil tankers
1736 2018-12-20 21:07:15 They've been doing that for years.  Mining and oil are both notorious industries for abandoning their responsibility to clean up after themselves.  O&G in Alberta has quite the scam going that results in orphan wells.

1748 2018-12-20 21:06:04 BREAKING: Today, I joined litigation to protect NC’s beautiful coast. Our shore supports tens of thousands of jobs & billions in economic activity. I will do everything in my power to protect our coast from offshore drilling for oil & gas.
1749 2018-12-20 21:06:02 It's cheaper to build solar arrays in US manufacturing plants and to overpay US workers, than it is to dig for oil in far-away countries with trillion $ bloated military budgets to protect private interests.
Do the math Spanky...
1750 2018-12-20 21:06:01 They used coconut oil to “assist” in the explaining
1751 2018-12-20 21:06:01 In a way. However Doterra Air essential oil blend is a life saver . Reduced my symptoms right down.
1752 2018-12-20 21:05:59 He is tired of expending American blood and treasure on Middle East oil and people who hate Americans.

1754 2018-12-20 21:05:52 Gas and oil companies.
1755 2018-12-20 21:05:40 Well played to those CEOs who hedged their production at higher oil prices

1758 2018-12-20 21:05:30 I ASKED MY COUSIN FOR ALCOHOL BUT SHE GAVE ME COCONUT OIL AYAN INOM PA
1759 2018-12-20 21:05:21 Separation is the battlecry of the monumentally stupid fixated on false idea oil drives Canada's economy & isn't a notoriously fragile, cyclical industry benefiting the few. Had to listen to this talk every 5-6 years growing up there. It's the pipe dream of short-sighted egotists
1760 2018-12-20 21:05:21 Getting an oil change, adulting rn brb
1761 2018-12-20 21:05:16 Fire g. Garlic infused olive oil drizzled all over dat and its heaven heaven
1762 2018-12-20 21:05:12 Crude Oil Price is going down to $30 / barrel again?
1763 2018-12-20 21:05:12 ああぁあぁぁ…………良い
1764 2018-12-20 21:05:10 I'm assuming by sense, they meant allowing the PC's to effectively give away the oil patch for the best part of 40 years?

1768 2018-12-20 21:04:40 Oil & water
1769 2018-12-20 21:04:21 Reason is simple. The oil marketers were the ones creating the scarcity. Like they have been doing for years.
1770 2018-12-20 21:04:13 pistils and petals, dashes and semicolons, oil and arugula, rockets and unicorns, you and me and me and you and watching netflix on the couch with blankets and cats while cracking pistachios and jokes late at night, the moon and stars and binaries of late capitalism
1771 2018-12-20 21:04:12 In case someone wants to duplicate my feat, top make this, pour an airline bottle of Captain Morgan's Spiced Rum into a measuring cup. Add witch hazel to bring the volume to 3/4 cup. Stir in one T vegetable glycerin and 20 or so drops bay essential oil. Boom. Bay rum aftershave.
1772 2018-12-20 21:03:57 We've been baby sitting the Kurds for almost twenty years now. How many more American lives arenyou willing to lose for Middle East oil?
1773 2018-12-20 21:03:57 Coconut oil!
1774 2018-12-20 21:03:50 this!!! I also remember twitter threads going viral telling people to use coconut oil religiously even though it’s comedogenic and can clog pores 
1775 2018-12-20 21:03:46 Does Lee have good insider tips for his viewers?  Is he back into oil?
1776 2018-12-20 21:03:41 Oil dried it up?
1777 2018-12-20 21:03:41 2 Kings 2: 23 - 24. 23 From there Elisha went up to Bethel. As he was walking along the road, some boys came out of the town and jeered at him. 'Get out of here, baldy!' they said. 'Get out of here, baldy!' Be CAREFUL what you wish for...you may OFTEN get it!
1778 2018-12-20 21:03:36 My thoughts exactly! I rarely use any products on my hair to keep it from getting so oily. It’s not so bad if I keep it naturally curly, but if I straighten it, it looks like I dunked my head in a bucket of oil 
1779 2018-12-20 21:03:29 Break or not fulfill. Big difference. Kenney campaigned on not cancelling income trusts. He broke that promise hurting Alberta oil companies in the process. Yet another example of anti Alberta behaviour by Kenney and the CPC.
1780 2018-12-20 21:03:28 The Farm Bill is OFFICIALLY LAW!! 

CBD Oil is FEDERALLY LEGAL!!
1781 2018-12-20 21:03:22 lmao i have been crying about my grades for the past like 20 minutes and now i am buying clothes to fill the void left by me not being good enough. school and good mental health are actually like oil and water
1782 2018-12-20 21:03:20 Cause some little oil keep stealing the street name signs.
1783 2018-12-20 21:03:20 Thank you for connecting with us offline, Logan. We are very happy that we were able to resolve your issue. We look forward to seeing you Saturday for your oil change. Don't hesitate to reach back out if we could be of any further assistance!
1784 2018-12-20 21:03:02 45th now seeks control of space having given up on this world 45th plans to burn all the oil and coal bring on the climate tipping point, let Putin and Iran take over then scarper into space Why not send him there now and let the world rebalance
1785 2018-12-20 21:03:02 Rise in fed rate made oil more affordable. That is what we hav seen
1786 2018-12-20 21:02:55 Gee, I recall a Goldman "case" for $20 oil in 2016.
1787 2018-12-20 21:02:48 So I was just in Saje with #FatherDave helping him look for an essential oil diffuser for big sister, and he kept asking the lady there where they kept the bongs. I can't take him anywhere.
1788 2018-12-20 21:02:41 見間違いじゃねえ、、、、まじか、、、
1789 2018-12-20 21:02:20 Or railway sleepers with decades of seeped in tar, oil and, er, flushed toilets. But blimey, they don’t half make a cracking fire.
1790 2018-12-20 21:02:15 I think it’s both.
I think he has certain goals that align with GOP like tax cut, immigration, oil drilling.
Foreign policy, healthcare he is awful. No clue.
He has no negotiating or leadership skills.
1791 2018-12-20 21:02:13 It will simply be great because Mamador is synonymous with standard products. I have its groundnut oil.
1792 2018-12-20 21:02:11 え、まじで6時すぎてんの？見間違いじゃない？
1793 2018-12-20 21:02:08 Trump auctioned federal land $2 an acre to oil and fossil exploration to foreign countries. My blood is boiling!!!
1794 2018-12-20 21:02:03 “I went for an oil change and came home with a new car” @BritaniMoore 
1795 2018-12-20 21:02:03 Honestly don't like perfume oil .
1796 2018-12-20 21:02:00 Our Federal Government doesn't have the balls to do anything like imposing tariffs on oil! I think they should impose tariffs on oil coming from countries with less than "Canadian" values. What are we doing business with countries with horrible human rights standards.
1797 2018-12-20 21:01:55 You do realize that all oil is bought and sold on the global market, right? Problems in the Middle East that restrict the flow of oil results in more competition for U.S. oil exports. That *may* be good for our exports, but not good for U.S. companies, consumers and refineries.
1798 2018-12-20 21:01:54 ugh i have to get an oil change.
1799 2018-12-20 21:01:49 Oil
1800 2018-12-20 21:01:49 Glory be to God! 
 I met a woman whose legs were swollen and completely black, she was in severe pain, I prayed for her and bought anointing oil,prayed for it and gave it to her to be using.
Now she is okay
1801 2018-12-20 21:01:45 @jimcramer Like a moth to a light, I can't pass up entering a 1/4 position today.  Largest oil service company that knows what its doing, on sale today!  SLB  If i'm wrong, will add another 1/4 position down the road.
1802 2018-12-20 21:01:42 PASSES SENATE: I'm proud my #bipartisan re-refining bill is on its way to be signed into law. We need an up-to-date report from the DoE that'll allow Congress to better develop energy saving & environmentally conscious policy in connection w/how we use & reuse lubricating oil.

1806 2018-12-20 21:01:22 Anytime the Koch brothers are involved I have my suspicions that they and the other plutocrat are attempting to subvert democracy and take over the country. This Atlantic Council is another of the examples with its membership of oil monarchies making decisions for Facebook.
1807 2018-12-20 21:01:19 Wind and solar are increasing each year, but need more investment to make the switch to Zero CO2 by 2050. Nukes are a waste of investment: more expensive, far more dangerous & far slower to implement. CCS just means “Clean Coal”, “Clean Gas” & “Clean Oil”. Not clean safe or just.
1808 2018-12-20 21:01:10 ok but i really want an essential oil diffuser
1809 2018-12-20 21:01:06 Let's back up, so farmers should plow & harvest food for free, truck drivers should deliver food for free, store keeps should stock shelves for free so the PEOPLE should get free food?  But who makes the tractors and trucks and oil to make the go?  All for free?
1810 2018-12-20 21:01:03 Bring, cooking oil, petrol nekamari kacho ontop preferably US$
1811 2018-12-20 21:01:00 OMG I'm so excited about this! As a current user of CBD oil I'm more than excited to try what Young Living has to offer!
1812 2018-12-20 21:00:48 That's how it was. First exception was made when Berbers kept raiding American ships. Berbers tamed, US retreated to its shorelines. Oil changed it all?

1815 2018-12-20 21:00:35 Probably bc it's quicker and you can reuse the oil
1816 2018-12-20 21:00:26 coconut oil pull every night
1817 2018-12-20 21:00:14 Haven’t found a good setup to daytrade or just haven’t been watching close enough on my end with oil
1818 2018-12-20 21:00:14 Coconut oil is very healthy. It is high in special fats called medium chain triglycerides, which are metabolized differently than other fats
1819 2018-12-20 21:00:13 And you promised this. But you took care of ISIS 1st. Big thing you did was defend them. Like the had billions in oil money and trafficking. I wish your it was well known how that went down.
1820 2018-12-20 21:00:09 that's me with the oil sorry I like to test it with water sorry
1821 2018-12-20 21:00:06 OIL BLOODBATH: Brent crude down ~5% to intraday low of $54.28 a barrel. WTI plunges to $45.67 a barrel | #OOTT #OPEC
1822 2018-12-20 21:00:05 Wondering if your data conflates NG and Oil firms and misses  how different the oil producers look today vs in 2014.  Also wondering what oil companies can do this time, without the benefit of large capital infusions and dramatically reduced costs?
/End
1823 2018-12-20 21:00:02 if only my non-stick frying pan could take a sledgehammer and still cook an egg without oil or butter. OH BUT WAIT, THERE’S MORE
1824 2018-12-20 21:00:00 Yung sa sobrang pagod ko kagabe, kuha lahat ng oil e pahid sa katawan sabay tulog.

Copper -0.4% to 2.70 lb $CU
1826 2018-12-20 20:59:51 So your telling us the oil industry is not good for Canada ? I wonder how many bluenosers have immigrated to Alberta to work and also reaps the benefits from the revenue that has floooded into the federal gov coffers ?
1827 2018-12-20 20:59:44 oh yea hoe, do what she says, put lavender oil on your wrists and also Schläfen and under ur jaw, i have insomnia and this does help at least a little bit !!
1828 2018-12-20 20:59:35 The war in Syria was simply to get Asad out of power so the oil pipeline from Qatar to Turkey could be built. We have stayed because of the Obama funded I.S.I.S. needed to be dealt with. Mission accomplished. Bring them home
1829 2018-12-20 20:59:32 サマの目は燃えるような赤とか血の色の赤とかなんかそんなかんじのイメージある
1830 2018-12-20 20:59:19 You didn't win agnist isis you killed people for their own land because of the oil you want same as you killed Gaddafi and Sadam Hussen cause Americans wants to rule and steal from other people
1831 2018-12-20 20:59:18 definitely had a dream someone was trying to cook w/ olive oil on high heat and it was sputtering and flying everywhere like lava while i was having some dumbass swordfight getting burnt by oil every 5 seconds.
1832 2018-12-20 20:59:14 Snake oil is the original name for natural medicine. Obviously coined by the Big Pharma mafia, so yes, I would love some of that snake oil.
1833 2018-12-20 20:59:11 The left now endorses threatening war with the only other major nuclear power on the planet over a dusty bit of desert with oil we no longer need and scarcely an intact building in the entire country.
Let Russia go broke trying to make something of it.  We're done.
1834 2018-12-20 20:59:09 Bachelor's life I cooked noodles, I added too much pepper my friend cooked his the groundnut oil was too much! 2019 would be better
1835 2018-12-20 20:59:05 just a heads up, this bill legalizes the grow and sell of hemp as a product, and legalizes the sell of cbd oil.
1836 2018-12-20 20:58:46 Closed my auto repair shop down last month after my family owned and operated it for 25 years. Two of my children went this week for oil changes at two different shops. Both shops took excellent care of my kids. Thank you to all of those hard working folks.
1837 2018-12-20 20:58:45 So stupid. Like speeding is always directly related to death. Put me in a test and I assure i'm way more concentrated with 120 mph than with 80 mph on a nightly highway. Faster home: wife happy. Burn more petrol: oil comp happy +  government happy for more taxes. I c no problem.
1838 2018-12-20 20:58:38 I dispute that it's hate as much as you are just mindlessly regurgitating false oil industry propaganda. That was also my initial reply to the tweet we are responding to.
1839 2018-12-20 20:58:29 Insha ALLAH. AMEEN
1840 2018-12-20 20:58:25 Oil or natural
1841 2018-12-20 20:58:19 Another resolution of mine is to try your O Blood Orange Olive Oil!! #mmmmm
1842 2018-12-20 20:57:36 Win Jan canola down A$4.38/t but EU rape up A$0.71. Currency hurt A$ canola prices but helped A$ rapeseed prices. Crude oil prices weaker. Falling share prices spilled over to other risk assets.  Oilseeds down despite strong US soybn sales as supplies remain high.
1843 2018-12-20 20:57:34 And the opposite of Trump definitely isn't Hillary. The majority of the world thinks Trump is a buffoon, a self interested snake oil salesman who will ruin your country for his own gain, but that certainly doesnt make us fans of Hillary Clinton.
1844 2018-12-20 20:57:32 This must be one of the promises made to Puttin. Guess this will get you more oil stocks since you don't believe in divesting.

1847 2018-12-20 20:57:24 You are the reason I bought Nucor stock going back to the early 90’s.  You ran it right.  Can’t help but notice that oil has tanked and the stock market is down over 15% since the Dems won the house. Coincidence?
1848 2018-12-20 20:57:14 You don’t know pain until the oil spits and goes in your eye
1849 2018-12-20 20:57:02 It is true! There needs to be a standard for CBD oil. A way to for sure know it isn’t snake oil is it’s lab result! You can trust that reputable brands have them on the packaging or their website! 
1850 2018-12-20 20:56:43 For me it also helps to put some essential oil on my wrist. The more relaxed I am the less chance of nightmares I have
1851 2018-12-20 20:56:42 そうなんですよねぇw

値段と時間考えれば、ベストですね。
1852 2018-12-20 20:56:41 Helpful corrective. Per Pro Publica, Beto voted against his party 8% vs Bernie voting against party 20%. Berniacs argue those votes show Beto is in bed w/ big oil. But Beto receives a 95% positive score on the environment from LVC. Bernie scores lower. Biden’s LVC score is 83%.
1853 2018-12-20 20:56:39 Your constituents in the riding of Milton (as in Milton/Burlington ONTARIO) are concerned about pipelines and oil industry in Alberta?  Weird.  I really though "all politics were local". Guess not.
1854 2018-12-20 20:56:28 Tenergy Pluvi Ultrasonic Cool Mist Humidifier Essential Oil!! Omg, yes please!! I use essential oils every day. #TenergyChristmas
1855 2018-12-20 20:56:26 U.S. crude oil prices are in a near free fall,closing in the American market below $46 a barrel, for the first time since August 2017.
1856 2018-12-20 20:56:24 The clean up will cost much more, wait too long, & faceless oil & gas profiteers will do the same thing GM did when it’s time to clean it up: they’ll leave.

The 1.6 is to bail out provincial politicians who spent billions building before they had approval for the foundation.
1857 2018-12-20 20:56:19 They will... and then they will hqve explqin why russia woupd want to secure pur borders . As well as creat a boomong economy.. beef our military.. revive our steel industry and make us the worlds leader in oil and gas equally t9tql energy independance.
1858 2018-12-20 20:56:13 Any ideas on how to make yuan-oil-gold go away? Without war, I mean.
1859 2018-12-20 20:56:11 We will never agree so lets agree to disagree. Your hate and anger towards the oil industry is obvious and one cannot fight hate.
1860 2018-12-20 20:56:08 If your mechanic take longer than 4 hours to do an oil change best believe they fuck ur car up
1861 2018-12-20 20:56:08 Do you think that fuel (gas) is the only product based on hydrocarbon extraction end processing?

The damage caused by lithium extraction and processing is significantly worse than oil, both for health and environmental impacts.  

We need a new energy source, it doesn't exist.
1862 2018-12-20 20:56:07 one doesn’t need to abstain from using the oil that powers society today in order to argue for change tomorrow

1870 2018-12-20 20:55:34 Soooo 
Now Russia will have control over the Syrian ports and will be able to have direct connections to the Suez and barricade oil imports from the Saudi’s. Leaving Russia a virtual monopoly in distribution of foreign oil to America? Did I miss anything? Can you say BILLIONS.
1871 2018-12-20 20:55:25 What is your take on CBD oil?
Please share any information or personal experiences good or bad with using CBD oil.
1872 2018-12-20 20:55:11 Even worse Ray is because HMRC took no action against what you call ‘snake oil’ these schemes were mainstream - HMRC’s impact assessment is garbage - low income workers doing valuable jobs - ethnic minorities - somebody is to blame for that - was not the individuals!
1873 2018-12-20 20:55:07 Hey Climate Barbie .... FYI ... the Conservatives have a plan to deal with Climate change.  It doesn't Include a Carbon Tax, or the Destruction of our Manufacturing or Oil sectors

1878 2018-12-20 20:54:42 To “combat the rising prices of oil”? The article talks about the dropping oil prices. Makes as much sense as global warming.

1883 2018-12-20 20:54:26 Till they run out of oil.
1884 2018-12-20 20:54:25 Asparagus with butter?! Fuck that shit! Oil and salt!
1885 2018-12-20 20:54:23 Yeah, little veg oil keeps the grains fresh and separated. And the onions takes it to a whole ‘nother level with its aroma and flavor. You should try
1886 2018-12-20 20:54:11 In a little bit of oil or butter. You're eating out then? :(
1887 2018-12-20 20:54:09 Free movement shouldn't mean flying here, there & everywhere. Pillaging oil & the earth's resources from other lands. That's rabid capitalism. Culture + geography are fluid ideas that shouldn't be boxed, defined. Our identities are becoming more hybrid.
1888 2018-12-20 20:54:05 Chilli oil from the noodles splashed in my eye and it got swole and in my nostrils and it burned
1889 2018-12-20 20:53:55 I had truffle oil but that was so yummy it went pretty damn quickly. 
1890 2018-12-20 20:53:52 Wouldn't you agree our national security should come first before we try to leverage other foreign Nations just to secure arms and oil agreements? We have done our job there with ISIS if they come back so will we.

1895 2018-12-20 20:53:32 I have decided next time I see a flatbed with a piece of oil equipment driving on 63 I am going to straddle the center line and drive 5 km/h you know to stand up for Alberta pipelines.

1899 2018-12-20 20:53:15 Sorry sir. U should change the battery. I think that's the problem.
1900 2018-12-20 20:52:55 It's actually being done with corn and olive oil.  But not totally common!

1902 2018-12-20 20:52:23 Just used an oil primer & I work until midnight, pray for my foundation.
1903 2018-12-20 20:52:00 Oh and you left out Data the digital oil that lubricates business, commerce, government and international trade.
1904 2018-12-20 20:51:59 出社
1905 2018-12-20 20:51:52 Almond oil and helps with elasticity
1906 2018-12-20 20:51:51 Light control: an oil like jojoba or almond. Medium control: a styling gel like Bumble&Bumble sumotech. Heavy: a sculpting wax, I don't typically use this so no personal suggestions.
1907 2018-12-20 20:51:45 Lol, they have more money than ppl in stable economies. So not completely true even as a hypothesis. OPEC controls the price (inflation) of oil by constraining supply to levels that are below demand. This increases the price. We can’t supply, plausible hypothesis.
1908 2018-12-20 20:51:33 Ameen brother. Thanks your memo and bag is ready. But i didn't see the DP
1909 2018-12-20 20:51:32 Oh this makes me so happy. I'm definitely crying, but happy tears. CBD oil is truly the stuff of miracles. Its great to know it helps animals just as much as it does humans. Falo just got the best Christmas gift ever.
1910 2018-12-20 20:51:23 Whoa. I'm sorry! Get well soon! Maybe stick to olive oil.
1911 2018-12-20 20:51:22 It’s hard to oil the window if all you have are paws.
1912 2018-12-20 20:51:09 I’m ALL for this!!!  Idiots whole drink the snake oil this jackass sells can pay for a wall.  I won’t.
1913 2018-12-20 20:50:57 Due to the sickness, I’ve taken so much oil of oregano that now my home smells like Danny Aiello’s undershirt. #DoYouFuckinBelieveIt

1915 2018-12-20 20:50:51 Take out the palm oil and we're good ok 
1916 2018-12-20 20:50:49  when people use the words "tar sands" I stop listening, keep mixing your oil with blood
1917 2018-12-20 20:50:49 Subsidies should go to clean energy and other industries that can shield us from a similar oil crash in the future, but the oil industry should definitely be able and allowed to self-sustain.
1918 2018-12-20 20:50:46 I used to always buy Mushroom grips.
One day I put oil on the bars to get them on easier. 
I got them on easily.
Went 20 yards down the road and pulled a wheelie flew off backwards 
Fucking sat on my arse with both grips still in my hands..
Bike went straight into a parked car!
1919 2018-12-20 20:50:40 US oil prices are in free fall, closing below $46 a barrel for the first time since August 2017.

1921 2018-12-20 20:50:36 Да ничего, мне прям приятно, что хоть кто-то будет в теме. Давай я в лс продолжу?
1922 2018-12-20 20:50:31 MGS V and Peace Walker both attempt this with an oil rig instead
1923 2018-12-20 20:50:30 Took me over 45 min to blow dry all this hair. 
Tea Tree Oil & Aloe Vera Juice got my scalp tingling.
1924 2018-12-20 20:50:30 The only way that an effective control of the Middle East can be gained is for all countries to stop all arms sales to all the regimes. The military industrial complex that is the USA will never do that because Middle East oil is vital to the economy.
1925 2018-12-20 20:50:26 Urgh...a mouthful of motor oil...no thanks! 

Weirdly I’ve just remembered that I’ve got two vinyl Metal Mickey singles somewhere.

China

Who has better enviromental,social standards?

Whos O&G industry benifits their country the most and not a dictator?

Which country obeys the rule of law?

Again,who should supply energy needs?
1934 2018-12-20 20:49:39 wouldnt the same tools used to heat up oil be used to heat up water?
1935 2018-12-20 20:49:24 Bless my boss, I'm gonna get my oil change tomorrow, get everything ready for Mission: Get Dad to Houston, and start planning out my roadtrip :)
1936 2018-12-20 20:49:20 Who cares? It's been a hellhole for a thousand years and will most likely be for another thousand. We no longer need their oil, so let them fade back into sandy irrelevance while they continue to murder each other - just like they always have. We'll keep our trillions of $$$.
1937 2018-12-20 20:49:20 When ya got such a volume of clips, I just can’t be arsed naming them
1938 2018-12-20 20:49:11 The other thing is that, unlike the good old conventional oil world, their is such a thing as marginal operator.  Low price enviros accelerate consolidation to the best operators.
1939 2018-12-20 20:49:09 Putin praised you for withdrawing the troops. I bet this is one step towards your true goal in profiting in real estate in the Middle East with Russia & Saudi Arabia. Why don’t you tell your supporters & America it’s all about oil & real estate in the ME controlling port

1943 2018-12-20 20:48:38 With oil prices so low those restaurants save a lot of money using jet fuel to make fries over using vegetable oil.

1946 2018-12-20 20:48:27 Perks of working at a dealership is free car washes , free vacuum & half price oil changes 
1947 2018-12-20 20:48:26 I saw that.  It asked respondents where they wanted to get their oil from.  It did not mention the Energy East Pipeline.

1949 2018-12-20 20:47:47 Sen. Graham is foreseeing a collapse in the area where it will fireback on us. If the area fell in the hands off Assad-Iran-Russia, they'll have a big chunk of oil fields that will refund Iran's terrorist activities throughout the globe.

1964 2018-12-20 20:45:57 Big thanks to @medixcbd! I placed an order 2 or 3 days ago for some oil for our Shepherd for an upcoming road trip. I messaged them asking about shipping time  bc we leave Sunday. A hour later they shipped out stuff!! We got it with a day to spare

1967 2018-12-20 20:45:54 Would those happen to be oil industry workers?
1968 2018-12-20 20:45:52 Thanks Mr. President for low prices in oil crude, the Petrobras in Brazil are decreasing gasoline and diesel in this country!!
Thanks again.

1970 2018-12-20 20:45:36 Upgrade the pail to a 45 gallon oil drum? Plenty of those laying around I’m sure.
1971 2018-12-20 20:45:31 Lol. I guess flagging off and starting something are two different things. And @habeeb011 30 years is just been optimistic but realistically clean up of oil spills usually takes close to 50 years optimally.

1978 2018-12-20 20:45:09 - No worries, what could go wrong, it’s just a few of the largest bodies of fresh water on the planet...? It’s not like climate change could cause those to become integrally important to life or anything...  but those oil pipelines never leak anyway so we have that to comfort us.
1979 2018-12-20 20:45:06 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
1980 2018-12-20 20:45:05 Do you not change your CPU oil once a year?

1984 2018-12-20 20:44:32 Selling Shale oil for burning OPM, effectively proves the ideology of free market could create tremendous economic disaster. Shale oil, should never have been allowed when the the oil price is below $80 a barrel. USA need set up its own OPEC.

1993 2018-12-20 20:43:36 Stock market below 23,000 today & oil is in a free fall. Administration is killing food stamps & shutting down the Government which will force 500,000 to work without pay during the Holidays. So Merry Christmas People.

1994 2018-12-20 20:43:32 does CBD oil actually work
1995 2018-12-20 20:43:24 As Canadians we can’t speak for other nations. So let’s use our oil until we figure out how to ween our dependence. It’s the safest. And in the meantime we can heat our homes and eat.

1997 2018-12-20 20:42:55 Trump is a f*cking disaster in business he has a YUGE debt and is plundering away, getting rich from Big Oil, Gas and Coal, Big Pharma lobbyist. @GOP COMPLICIT
1998 2018-12-20 20:42:55 На сколько разные? Сори,если задалбывабю, но мне действительно интересно
1999 2018-12-20 20:42:48 Ideally the way out of this is for a government to address, as much as it can, the valid concerns of all affected. The problem is when some of the affected lie in order to falsely push their concerns, as we are clearly seeing the Alberta oil industry do.
2000 2018-12-20 20:42:43 Ooh yes, I am planning to sand and oil butcher blocks next week! So satisfying!
2001 2018-12-20 20:42:42 Ooh good luck. Let us know how you get on!  
Amy started on CBD oil a few days ago, think it’s too early to say if it’s having any effect... xx
2002 2018-12-20 20:42:37 The oil industry is using your husband to fight wars over oil.

The oil industry suppresses the green industry.  If we convert to green energy we will create American jobs and stop funding terrorism  through oil money. 

Your husband will be safer and will be with you more.
2003 2018-12-20 20:42:35 Exactly ! So my original point is that GOD IS BOTH. One isn’t lesser than the other. Both are needed. Engine and oil, apparently you didn’t read the thread..

2005 2018-12-20 20:42:29 ISIS seems to move around to wherever they are needed to break countries down so that they will demand less from oil and LNG companies when negotiations go down. ISIS seems to be near pipelines too -hmmmmm.
2006 2018-12-20 20:42:26 О, круто, если его пофиксили.
2007 2018-12-20 20:42:24 Would be really helpful to see any of your data or analysis that supports this
2008 2018-12-20 20:42:11 lol--"destroying lives to save the world" makes no sense? Better that Alberta oil jobs are saved than the world's climate. Adam, stop arguing with this buffoon. Read his tweets and you will see that you are wasting your time.
2009 2018-12-20 20:42:09 Worries over weak demand/ oversupply drag on oil prices. Brent crude LCOc1 futures fell 5.05%, to settle at $54.35 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures fell 4.75%, to settle at $45.88 a barrel. #oil #ASX #ausbiz
2010 2018-12-20 20:42:00 Yes. Oil and money have always been factors.  It’s not a simple equation.  We don’t have all the facts. But, leaving the ME will not solve the problems, if the only plan is to give control to Putin.
2011 2018-12-20 20:41:49 DC area -Feds are major employer 
Western US - Doesn't appear to be agriculture (Mid-west isn't blue on map). Maybe Department of Interior impacts? Major portions of West are owned by Feds (think Parks, Grazing land, mining, etc)
Gulf Coast....beats me. Maybe offshore oil rigs?
2012 2018-12-20 20:41:40 The GOP are their own worst enemy at this point.  No one has had the guts to stand up and say ENOUGH!  The republican party will fail at the hands of a snake oil salesman with a bad spray tan and a shitty comb-over.  It's a shame.

2016 2018-12-20 20:41:16 I appreciate that. I’m very proud of our industry, the gains it’s made in regards to the environment, safety and workers rights. The world is oil&gas dependant, incl. environmentalists, I will continue to fight for CAD oil&gas b/c it’s actively investing and working to reduce CO2
2017 2018-12-20 20:41:08 Понятно. Но там вроде перевод пофиксил, как писали в комментах, но я хз. Если начнётся кривой перевод мне будет не лень переиграть по новому на инглише. Так что, по любому всё будет ок
2018 2018-12-20 20:40:58 So @jamieoliver you roast potatoes in olive oil not goosefat? Not so sure I'm happy about that.
2019 2018-12-20 20:40:41 It's like debating a wall with #centrists. Now dangit, you know he's got a cute smile (not really) and he's young so millenialls will love him (they see str8 thru him) and he is OPEN to big $$ and big oil. He's PURRFECT. If you want to lose, run him. #Bernie2020

2026 2018-12-20 20:39:53 According to who? Forgive me if I don't take oil funded Cato institute meteorologist as the sole source of this info
2027 2018-12-20 20:39:49 His Muslim ban is ridiculous since it doesn’t include Saudi Arabia, a government well known for arming and financing terrorist groups but yet sell us oil and we sell them weapons while allowing Trumps businesses there to operate with no issue, a violation of the amoluments law
2028 2018-12-20 20:39:44 Can you please impose massive tarrifs on whichever country sends us patchouli oil? @realDonaldTrump
2029 2018-12-20 20:39:37 Should we be trying to increase our population in the US? What for? So we can increase the GDP? That's a meaningless number. So more people can buy gas and make oil companies richer? Or so we can collect more taxes to manufacture more fighter jets? Is that our country's purpose?
2030 2018-12-20 20:39:30 Nobody would've survived in #Ghana under our various greed & corrupt leadership after Kwame Nkrumah if we're not having Gold, Cocoa & Oil here

-Oil fields
-Pipelines
-Euphrates River
-Major dams
-Rich agricultural land
-Strategic position against Iran
-Control of Syria/Iraq border
-Access to the Middle East
-Secular, reliable, strong Pro-Western ally, Kurds.
2033 2018-12-20 20:39:19 Congrats Robert!
2034 2018-12-20 20:39:17 I just had to replace the the breaks, oil and got a new set of tires all in one month because I can’t afford to get a new car this year like I planned. Also Christmas presents

2036 2018-12-20 20:39:08 This makes no sense. Iran has about 60 times the oil reserves of Syria. Russia has 32 times the amount. They don't need or want more oil.
2037 2018-12-20 20:39:05 Make sure Cheney, Rothchschild, Murdoch, Ross, Richardson, Rockefeller and all the big shots over at Genie Oil give their blessing. Let OUR troops defend OUR nation instead  of the banksters bottom line.
2038 2018-12-20 20:39:03 @JaValeMcGee get some damn black seed oil
2039 2018-12-20 20:38:53 So, the Venezuelan economy didn't receive 90 dollars out of every 100 from oil?

What is your alternative analysis?

2041 2018-12-20 20:38:40 Lavender is deffinitely the best essential oil 
2042 2018-12-20 20:38:33 I tried to find an accurate number but I gave up at reading all the depressing business news stories under this government for oil & gas. Staggering, really.   

Time for a fresh clean broom!
2043 2018-12-20 20:38:29 What's not true? We do have the strongest environmental standards.  Look at the top to Oil producing countries.Which country has better standards than Canada? Seriously, Which one?   

Is Alberta perfect? No. But we are getting better everyday. We are cleaning up our liabilities.

2050 2018-12-20 20:37:42 Beard oil, Anyone pls ?
2051 2018-12-20 20:37:37 Very true man. Baba oil dey your head,some smell like rotten ice fish so bad
2052 2018-12-20 20:37:35 I remember my Nan in my parent's kitchen, some time in the mid-80s, saying 'Why is yer olive oil on the counter and not in the medicine cabinet? It's fer yer lug'oles!'
2053 2018-12-20 20:37:28 Yes let’s just shut down the energy industry in this country all together, throw our economy into oblivion, and count on nice places like Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Russia, and Nigeria for the world’s oil supply. That would fix everything I’m sure.
2054 2018-12-20 20:37:20 SDF-YPG dont represend Muslim Kurds, they dont fight with isis either. SDF-YPG is a useful proxy in the region to jack oil reserves, drug trafficking and change demographics against Arabs who are the majority. Btw their offical ideology is against U.S and they hate Americans.
2055 2018-12-20 20:37:11 Here's mine. Putin told him to do it. Clears way for mega oil deals. And more Russian sanctions will fall too.
2056 2018-12-20 20:37:10 boo hoo .... go cry in your cup of oil subsidies ...
2057 2018-12-20 20:37:05 К сожалению, я не знаю. Я играл с кривым. Большая часть игры нормально переведена. Но есть некоторые места где криво.
2058 2018-12-20 20:37:05 #ImWithConrad ! #independence for England. #GoForItConrad. So..where will England get income, water and oil revenues from.? No matter, Conrad Brexited without a plan - he knows stuff. I'm sure England will flourish on it's own as it will have #WTOBrexit to rely on.
2059 2018-12-20 20:36:59 When you pay tens of thousands for crappy oil paintings and a autograph of a washed up NFL player that are worth nothing, and pay for it with charity money, it says all you need to know about the orange turd.

You just gave massive oil reserves to Russia. 

Its no wonder every business of yours has failed
2062 2018-12-20 20:36:44 Qatar, suadia arabia, and turkey i believe sold there oil. Our allies (funded isis.)

But for sure we funded other  rebels like fsa, kurds to cause chaos, fight isis and overthrow assad. Many foreigners fought in syria.Syria can regain its country. Isis gets defunded and it loses

2064 2018-12-20 20:36:40 You think it doesn't affect the US when entire countries collapse and even more people come seeking refugee status (for longer periods of time), oil supplies get taken over by extremists, trade to/from those countries halts, Russia/Iran consolidates more economic power, etc?
2065 2018-12-20 20:36:29 I largely agree with you there what I disagree on is leaving our allies. I agree with you entirely on the Middle East But the irony is if we left and and anything happens to all those oil fields everyone here would be crying about higher gas payments.
2066 2018-12-20 20:36:26 North Sea Oil, kiddo. North Sea Oil

2069 2018-12-20 20:36:08 Each of these bins contains an insane assortment of things. One is just full of bottles of motor oil and it’s so heavy I don’t know if I can move it. But there is literally no one else to do this.
2070 2018-12-20 20:36:04 We know, that the carbon saturating the atmosphere comes from humans burning fossil fuels — oil, coal, nat gas composed of long-dead plants, trees, & marine life. When burned for energy, they give off a carbon signature, lighter form of carbon all of Earth's plants breathe.

2074 2018-12-20 20:35:50 Does CBD oil really help w anxiety???
2075 2018-12-20 20:35:50 Shining and protecting my shoes. Polishing wood furniture, mostly with vegetable oil.  Feels good to take care of what I have rather than replacing or buying more.
2076 2018-12-20 20:35:49 All paid for with oil.. If our government was smart it would have done the same.
2077 2018-12-20 20:35:35 I know this is none of my business but... I just have to ask, oil in white rice!  For real ?
2078 2018-12-20 20:35:33 Yeah I mean, Ethan is more along the lines of Jim Bakker than anything. Or maybe Glenn Beck if I'm being generous, but that imploes a level of charisma I dont think he has. Alex Jones? Insert generic dude selling snake oil in the name of Jesus.
2079 2018-12-20 20:35:30 I think I agree. I've benefited greatly from colloidal silver, 'full extract cannabis oil (FECO) and now colloidal gold. I also recommend everyone keep hydrated properly. Dr. Batmanghelidj said 'you are not sick you are thirsty'.
2080 2018-12-20 20:35:21 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.

2083 2018-12-20 20:35:01 The kurds never learn, the halabja massacre during Saddam Hussein reign was godfathered by the USA, then recently the US allowed Nuri Al Malik to "capture" kirkuk (where there is biggest oil fields) during their recent failed referendum...
2084 2018-12-20 20:35:00 Guy am just in a cab heading home. This is what you call making money huh? Meanwhile lets share your rice and oil, ve used mine to do rship mgt as usual.
2085 2018-12-20 20:34:54 Which communities forest and water are being ruined by Alberta’s oil industry? Which ones in Quebec specifically?
2086 2018-12-20 20:34:49 Drive to the Ontario/Manitoba boarder.. wind mills there.. southern Alberta in the Magrath area, hundreds of them, Saskatchewan. dead birds litter the ground.  And they need oil, to keep moving... yes put up more..
2087 2018-12-20 20:34:48 It’s especially dumb because mayo is made almost entirely of oil??? WTF.
2088 2018-12-20 20:34:43 that's why these calls that fracked oil is $50 break even is a broken record. Frackers are epitome of Gresham's Law.

2091 2018-12-20 20:34:24 I'm not pretending to be an expert I'm just saying that there have to be alternatives and by immediately dismissing that possibility you're sorta just playing into the oil companies' hands lol

2094 2018-12-20 20:34:12 Personal data is the oil of the 21st century a resource worth billions
2095 2018-12-20 20:34:10 Imagine if Ataturk had stopped a Bornavat and negotiated with Britain and Greece. Used British naval support to take entire rim of Black Sea, sharing Romanian oil fields and producing garrison to defend Crimea. Make Smyrna economic engine with Istanbul. Use Greeks Osmanli gibi.
2096 2018-12-20 20:33:58 The oilfield has suffered job losses and pay cuts, I already said that...  It’s the only way the industry can survive, because we can’t get our oil to market, to fix the price differential.
2097 2018-12-20 20:33:57 The argument that climate scientists are corrupt & seek grants is garbage peddled by the fossil fuel lobby. If scientist were so corrupt fossil fuel wouldn’t pay them so much more to find coal & oil. Climate science does not take into account the size of a grant or their wage.
2098 2018-12-20 20:33:54 Just tried the Sharpie pen. Ink doesn't dry on the oil change stickers even after 24 hours.
2099 2018-12-20 20:33:51 are other Military will defend Iraq an oil field the sweet spot they will defend protect Against enemy !
2100 2018-12-20 20:33:48 I suppose you work in the oil industry...  Yes, it's not nice to have people attack one's livelihood but I think the petroleum age will end some time. It's not an infinite resource and it's hard on the planet. We need to transition to a cleaner energy.
2101 2018-12-20 20:33:45 Hopefully get a good sharp rally soon getting over extended #spx #oil

2104 2018-12-20 20:33:42 It's about the oil (and, who knows what other Natural Resources?). I believe that is why Russia (Iran and others as well) has such a keen interest. @LindseyGrahamSC is right! Just leave small group of volunteers.
2105 2018-12-20 20:33:40 can my skin pls chill no one needs this much oil
2106 2018-12-20 20:33:39 When you factor in that even the 20% exposed to the differential aren't exposed to all of it. The real number is less than 5. And there is no evidence that TMX addresses that. There is a growing glut of oil.
2107 2018-12-20 20:33:36 bin it
2108 2018-12-20 20:33:34 It time they actually defend OUR country and borders!!! Not the oil and opium traders.
2109 2018-12-20 20:33:33 Gold needs to out pace crude at the commodities mkt.
Oil needs to dive for economic prosperity to flourish.

2121 2018-12-20 20:32:44 I thought you were a good thing. Not anymore. You just bent over so Putin and Erdogan can take turns sticking it in you. You just handed your strategic enemy the oil fields of the Middle East. Way to go #Trumpski
2122 2018-12-20 20:32:39 We don’t need their oil we have enough in our own country. The problem is the environmentalist & a bunch of foreign lobbyists don’t want us to drill. They love it when we keep sending money to them & other countries for oil. Most likely we have the technology to keep it clean.
2123 2018-12-20 20:32:31 Sometimes black, sometimes a splash of soy, sometimes “bulletproof” with butter and coconut oil.

2125 2018-12-20 20:32:28 Shrug. Most socialists aren't against that. You'd also need to pass laws where wealth doesn't equate political power because oil tycoons aren't going to be agreeing with you I'm afraid.

What a time to be alive here at the apex of democracy as we teeter precariously near our sudden decline
2132 2018-12-20 20:31:52 Don’t try to talk sense to alt left greenies. The world oil demand grows and grows and grows. But sadly only Saudi, Nigeria, Russia, Norway, and the USA are allowed to make from it. We are the biggest patsy population in the world. Absolute idiocy.

2145 2018-12-20 20:30:47 Many remarks to make on current juncture but in the same way the oil trading/analytical complex was uniquely set up to be ill equipped for the 2003-2008 run, today, all the new lessons learned from that bull market will hurt you, not help you for what comes in 2018-2023.

I am the born of my oil.
だぜ、まったく
2150 2018-12-20 20:30:22 Selloff primary reason is the FED! Cheap oil puts $$'s back into consumer  economy and (oil) cheap input for chemicals, manufacturing! Bad for oil producer debt :)
2151 2018-12-20 20:30:20 Я конечно не шарю, что за игра, но выглядит круто. Кстати, а если seer такой крутой, то чего за него никто не играет?
2152 2018-12-20 20:30:13 Try primrose oil, it’s a pill take one by mouth and insert one as close to your cervix as you can before you go to bed. I did it and went into labor the next day!
2153 2018-12-20 20:30:12 いちろ~を労りつつも抜かさんするあたり、流石っす兄貴！
2154 2018-12-20 20:30:08 I hate car dealerships. I could change my own oil in about 15 min, but they take over an hour
2155 2018-12-20 20:29:53 BUSINESS SHOUT OUT:
Guys & Dolls have appointments available Friday & Saturday, also GHDS, Moroccan oil and gift vouchers. 812114
2156 2018-12-20 20:29:47 A LOT can happen in a half hour....#Dow has cut its losses by 40% ..now down 412.  #Oil closes at lowest level in nearly a year and a half on worries over slowing global economic growth..adding to the toxic brew of uncertainty on trade, the #Fed and possible gov't shutdown
2157 2018-12-20 20:29:45 Oil changed on car. Ready to get on the road tomorrow 
2158 2018-12-20 20:29:44 Dow sinks below 23,000; Nasdaq flirts with a bear market; Oil in free fall. #MAGA
2159 2018-12-20 20:29:41 The effects of Trudeau's anti oil policies, uncontrolled inflex of migrants, abuse of the transfer payment system, buying off the media to suppress the truth and uncontrolled borrowing are just a few reasons why Canada is  doomed.
It would take decades to recover.
Separate now !
2160 2018-12-20 20:29:40 Apparently, the miraculous power of snake oil has international appeal.
2161 2018-12-20 20:29:27 Nice try, sweetheart. 
Your argument is if there is no money, there should be job losses.
Now apply that same attitude to the oil industry. 
You can't because you are a hypocrite.
2162 2018-12-20 20:29:24 And we have sweet light crude oil that without, most Middle East oil is useless. America fist only if lives and trillions are not pissed away. The only time in history a nation goes to war wins said war and deminises the t live and money spent by giving nation away.
2163 2018-12-20 20:29:22 Young Living will be carrying pure organic, 100% pure CBD oil in January!!! WOOHOOOO
2164 2018-12-20 20:29:12 スーツ脱がしたら上はちくばん下はTバックとかセックスしてくださいって言ってるようなもんだろ！ねえサマトキサマ！？
2165 2018-12-20 20:29:12 They have so many Mines! Always needing workers!  
CEMEX cement.. I bet biggest in the world. Mines in MX.. conducting  global business. Many other types of mines.  There is money in the ground! No one should be poor in MX..  That is there GOV.  Could do like AK and Oil "A Check"
2166 2018-12-20 20:29:11 Oil for me 
2167 2018-12-20 20:29:08 Fucked around and watched a YouTube video using oil to remove my lash extensions lol never again... I ripped chunks of my actual ones off so now I’m left with bald eyes & excruciating pain from irritation lmaooo I clearly HATE MYSELF!!!
2168 2018-12-20 20:28:58 The act of betraying something. Is the definition of treason. So when Trudeau said the pipeline was a go east and west Quebec and Bc are treasonous against every other Canadian. Stop the oil and we are going to be a hurting country.
2169 2018-12-20 20:28:45 So cratering oil prices caused in part by near-unprecedented market volatility are all part of the master plan, then?
2170 2018-12-20 20:28:39 kim k said in a youtube video that she now doesn't feel like she needs makeup if her hair is done, so guess who has been putting lavender hair oil and actually styling their hair this week?? this bitchhh x
2171 2018-12-20 20:28:38 Не спорю, иногда это действительно так, но чаще всего я просто люблю добавить одну-две скобки потому что очень часто улыбаюсь, когда пишу твиты, и как-то сама по себе тыкаю эту скобочку, потому что считаю без неё твит незаконченным)
2172 2018-12-20 20:28:36 Concerted effort by those funding media ads to make Tesla's look more dangerous than legacy autos, despite them being way safer.

Legacy automakers & oil companies want to protect their $, at the expense of all of humanity 
2173 2018-12-20 20:28:33 Explain how we can send Mexico, Central America over 10 billion but cant spend half that on our own border.
2174 2018-12-20 20:28:26 Does it POOP nuts and bolts and pee engine oil?  ;)
2175 2018-12-20 20:28:25 Working trying to get a different job tho in the oil fields pays alot more than i am making now
2176 2018-12-20 20:28:18 I always say oil city but never seen an oil before
2177 2018-12-20 20:28:16 サマは初夜でいきなり抜かさんしてくるから
2178 2018-12-20 20:28:07 -random, but once she saw the oil and ticking bomb, it was clear what was going to happen. First — Baiken kicks said bomb and poisonous item out of range, specifically towards the doctor himself. The doll also met a similar fate, but instead of kicking, the ronin crushed it-
2179 2018-12-20 20:28:04 Fed never tightened in an envmt when oil dropped 35% or even 20%. Tightening during neutral to declining inflation & falling longyields is a blow to margins & carrytrade for banks & corps living on borrowing short & lending/investng long #forex $GLD $TNX $SDS $DXD $KBW $BKX
2180 2018-12-20 20:27:59 hypocrite, tu vas aussi profiter de l'annulation de la hausse des carburants!  J'espère que tu vas reverser aux associations les économies ainsi réalisées sur tes pleins d'essence ou de gas oil.
2181 2018-12-20 20:27:46 J'aime une vidéo @YouTube : "UYU Oil King (Rashid) vs The Cool Kid93 (Abigail) - EVO 2018 - Day 2 Pools - SFV - CPT 2018" à l'adresse
2182 2018-12-20 20:27:43 No we just go over to the countries and take their Resources under the disguise of  U.N Assistance. There's a reason why Oil drilling and Coal is frowned upon!! It Destroys the Planet!!!
2183 2018-12-20 20:27:42 Oil About Eve #filmsthatfloat
2184 2018-12-20 20:27:39 @RepBillFoster How much money do you get from the oil companies?  I hope you are challenged for re-election.
2185 2018-12-20 20:27:35 先っぽだけなら……といちろぉくんに許可を貰ったので僕は一気に奥までブチ込みました とても気持ちが良かったです(40代会社員)
2186 2018-12-20 20:27:28 I continue to find Big <noun> in the style of Big Oil or Big Tobacco the funniest thing and this shows no sign of abating as we enter 2019
2187 2018-12-20 20:27:26 Can you imagine if the Middle East didn't have a drop of oil beneath its soil? #oilwar
2188 2018-12-20 20:27:19 no. it's actually the worst take. mayo has acid and oil. eggnog is cream, egg, and sugar. totally different.
2189 2018-12-20 20:27:04 Full disclosure:  I've been inhaling oil fumes while reading twitter all day.  I'm basically an uncharismatic Charlie from Always Sunny right now.
2190 2018-12-20 20:27:03 Just realised that I’ve worked in Tech and now I work in Oil & Gas ... packaging will not kill us in Nigeria
2191 2018-12-20 20:26:46 Got the whole office smelling like Amber oil 
2192 2018-12-20 20:26:33 Congrats on the great performance!! Just curious, what was your best trade? 
Regarding your outlook on inflation creeping up, can you elaborate a bit? With oil prices this low it ll be a big drag. Though Id expect higher oil prices goin fwd. Weird to me the huge drop
2193 2018-12-20 20:26:33 Oil
Brent crude fell by US$2.89 or 5.0% to US$54.35 a barrel and the US Nymex price fell by US$2.29 or 4.8% to US$45.88 a barrel.

2194 2018-12-20 20:26:33 Drink more motor oil and swallow a match to burn the sickness out
2195 2018-12-20 20:26:27 Yea so quit with all the oil and gas subsidies already.
2196 2018-12-20 20:26:23 Are they single handedly trying to burn up the excess oil stuck in the province and needlessly worsen climate change in one event?
2197 2018-12-20 20:26:21 But remember its M7's oil not us!
2198 2018-12-20 20:26:12 NOC said today #Sharara oilfield “remains closed.” 

Our figures show #Libya’s crude oil & condensate exports remain above 1mn so far in Dec. 

We see a steady increase so far this month in exports from eastern ports, such as Ras Lanuf (182,000 bpd).
2199 2018-12-20 20:26:07 I concur, but think this is only about cooling the rethoric. Way too much money, intel and oil in the US-Saudi Arabia relations. Syria is about the Golan Heights and Russia, not so much Iran. If Assad isn't busy, he is insane enough to challenge Israel and kick the 1st WW3 domino
2200 2018-12-20 20:26:05 A parent ought to treat children as less careful, hence should have kept the oil away from the reach of children!
2201 2018-12-20 20:26:00 God so this iPhone decided to off just like that, n I left it at 78% nawa o, never seen this kind of thing before
2202 2018-12-20 20:25:57 Они выглядят пугающие
2203 2018-12-20 20:25:52 Mine is awesome when it's wet but humidity attacks it. It's freezing outside and boiling inside, thanks to the radiators. Hence, humidity up the wazoo. Someone told me coconut oil is good but I'm not so sure.
2204 2018-12-20 20:25:50 Hey anyone have a list of what Trudeau has done to help with the oil crisis in Alberta?
2205 2018-12-20 20:25:50 Yeah, I'm learning to paint with oil too and the most difficult part for me are the edges.
2206 2018-12-20 20:25:46 The same group that flies celebrities down in their private jets to do a press junket but never criticize US, Saudi or any other oil! Why is that? If they want a cleaner world shouldn't they go after the big guys?
2207 2018-12-20 20:25:19 BINGO! Now tell me how many pipelines the previous governments approved to tidewater. Tell me why those governments never worked with oil companies to ensure additional markets.
2208 2018-12-20 20:25:17 Oil spills for example have had huge impacts on eco systems.  Contributes to pollution and not good to breathe.
2209 2018-12-20 20:25:10 Блэт, а я без этих скобочек вообще жить не могу
2210 2018-12-20 20:25:07 Герой конечно крутой, но как только хантеры меня замечают, они гоняются только за мной  это с одной стороны печально
2211 2018-12-20 20:25:07 Yous can't get enough of it, for all the oil you have, you still invade other countries under the pretence of helping them, helping yourselves more like. Although Vietnam took none of your shit when you & the French were occupying their country. Sent yous packing lol
2212 2018-12-20 20:24:58 Re: new @HealthCanada #cannabis regulations - HC proposes removing cannabis oil from Sched. 4 as cannabis oil would be subsumed under the new product classes of edible cannabis, cannabis extracts, and cannabis topicals.
2213 2018-12-20 20:24:56 先っぽだけ！先っぽだけだから！(フラグ)
2214 2018-12-20 20:24:53 Все выжившие,когда видят за какую фифу я играю, считают, что мой долг -это вытаскивать их каждой жопы,куда они влипли, а Хантера такие : что? Seer?Чел, иди сюда, тут seer! Ты сказал seer? Эй, подожди, мы хотим тут на тебя позырить.
2215 2018-12-20 20:24:47 Bh could literally be getting free oil and all 
2216 2018-12-20 20:24:45 @IzziArrow poured some truffle oil on my pasta and thought of you 
2217 2018-12-20 20:24:40 Is it safe to use tea tree oil for fresh piercings?
2218 2018-12-20 20:24:38 I never realized really how pervasive oil is in our culture until I became a parent of a small child. It's tiny but glad to see this.
2219 2018-12-20 20:24:26 Yeah it's awful. Kids or dumbasses so being exposed to bigger dumbasses will effect them heavily
2220 2018-12-20 20:24:26 Either his account has been hacked or President Putin told him to make a distraction. There's weird shit going on in UK. Russian oil tanker grounded off coast yesterday, airport "shut down" by drones and army dispatched. Think the world has truly gone mad.
2221 2018-12-20 20:24:18 Taken a small $oil long. Tight stops just below lod

2224 2018-12-20 20:23:56 “Big oil is dead” LOL. LNG is not Big Oil.  And it’s not dead. They are taking their money to other countries. Big $$ investment in Canada is dead....
2225 2018-12-20 20:23:54 My da asked my bro that he wants cannabis oil for crimbo for real. Correct is if am wrong mark but am sure you gave me the drugs lecture when you find my big tub of kush when I was 19  will be lending tho
2226 2018-12-20 20:23:52 Mugged up theory. His great grandfather created Kashmir to keep the valley between Hindus n Muslims alive. His parivar added oil to the fire.
2227 2018-12-20 20:23:51 When one oil company buys out another, it includes the years of service of employees of the bought-out company in calculating their years of service as employees of the company making the purchase. I'm beginning to think the J, R. Ewings of the world are more honorable than...
2228 2018-12-20 20:23:48 Ok if we put the motor oil in with the lettuce?
2229 2018-12-20 20:23:46 Thank you for the kind words Vicky!  Loving your positive attitude. 

As for the applesauce--I haven't tried it myself, but I've had some readers do a split of applesauce and oil with good results. Let me know how it turns out!
2230 2018-12-20 20:23:45 If you want I can throws dozens of scientific papers at you that disprove the other documents. Stats are absolute but can be coerced to prove any point you want.
The econazis as I put it are the people who have been screaming AB oil is dirty dirty dirty!
2231 2018-12-20 20:23:43 I chloroformed myself with lavender essential oil last night and slept so well
2232 2018-12-20 20:23:36 Your government failed. 
So you are ok with all the nursing jobs that were cut because it wasn't your family? 
Your hypocrisy is amazing. 
Here you are, saying job cuts are ok... unless it is an oil job. 
Hypocrite.
2233 2018-12-20 20:23:27 The US is now the world’s largest oil producer.
2234 2018-12-20 20:23:26 スーツ着る時絶対ちくばんしてるしパンツはTバック
2235 2018-12-20 20:23:10 honestly, some fine sugar and some olive oil (or other oil of your choice) does not suck.
2236 2018-12-20 20:23:03 I use Jamaican black castor oil or pure shea butter after I wash my face
2237 2018-12-20 20:22:59 Well, as you very well know, certain members of the Deep State are receiving huge $s from the oil flowing from Iraq thru Syria to Turkey.  So, of course, if they think the $ will be cut off, they would veto so long as the $$$ continues.
2238 2018-12-20 20:22:54 I jus need to find sum good 100% castor oil now lol
2239 2018-12-20 20:22:44 You sais..if there was oil...U.S. would be there..I just pointed out that's not true or we would have been in Venez
2240 2018-12-20 20:22:44 Oil is at 45 I don’t think you’re getting paid this month
2241 2018-12-20 20:22:36 10,000 active duty soldiers coming back from Syria  could be stationed in the USA  and another 10,000 soldiers go to US/Mexico border, no...? Too much to ask..? They only good for promoting and protecting peace  overseas but not here for us in USA ...? Big Oil not payin?
2242 2018-12-20 20:22:32 ちくばんはね、確実にしてる
2243 2018-12-20 20:22:31 I'm a white girl. You could gift me coconut oil for Christmas and I'd be happy.
2244 2018-12-20 20:22:26 Just goan drop into ororo gbona (hot groundnut oil)
2245 2018-12-20 20:22:19 Oil slick
2246 2018-12-20 20:22:18 The market collapsed in Venezuela because the government seized the majority of the means of production from the private sector; then they mismanaged and stole almost all of the money that those companies generated and when oil prices fell there was no market to support the fall.
2247 2018-12-20 20:22:14 how come we don't know who Q is? Why no effort to expose this snake oil merchant?
2248 2018-12-20 20:22:14 The failure is from not acknowledging that oil & gas, and medical are the two biggest industries in Texas and distorting the info to look like private middle class donors are big time execs looking for quid pro quo deals. Plus 450k out of the 80mil in total donations ain't shit.
2249 2018-12-20 20:22:13 When did Germany start a war in the middle east for oil?
2250 2018-12-20 20:22:09 What conspiracy theory? The well-documented 1953 coup in Iran, first thought of by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and MI6 before they invited US President Eisenhower and the CIA to help? #MohammadMosaddegh #mosaddegh

2255 2018-12-20 20:21:37 Ladies what oil are you using on your body?
2256 2018-12-20 20:21:32 The price differential is because the States is our only customer, we can’t get the oil to other markets.
2257 2018-12-20 20:21:28 Yes but if you kill it and then fry it will spice and oil then it is delicious for secular animal lovers
2258 2018-12-20 20:21:18 #TenergyChristmas Tenergy Pluvi Ultrasonic Cool Mist Humidifier Essential Oil
2259 2018-12-20 20:21:12 You stole all that oil, or didn’t you think we were watching 
2260 2018-12-20 20:20:58 Might be Muslim. Don't they use something looking like an oil can that they fill with water & then wash the rear end with a hand? Seriously. I went to school for a year or so in England & there was a youth  from Turkey who had one.  Paper products are not common in many places.
2261 2018-12-20 20:20:58 No idea! I guess they could go in a pain with hot oil and lid closed? I’ll experiment!
2262 2018-12-20 20:20:58 ALL I USE 

Products: 

1) Good quality shower exfoliant gel

2) Essential oil (coconut, almond or olive oil)

3) 100% Raw unrefined Shea Body Butter from Ghana

Internal Intake: 

4) Fruits/veggies

5) 8 glasses of water a day or more

6) proper sleep + vitamain supplements
2263 2018-12-20 20:20:47 You need the rest of it ! 1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract 
Preheat oven to 180 deg C and prepare cupcake tin
Sift flour,bicarbonate & cocoa powder into a bowl , add salt & sugar & mix well 
Put the wet ingredients into another bowl ( orange juice, water,oil,vanilla extract ,vinegar )
2264 2018-12-20 20:20:46 Overproduction of oil is nearly as bad as not having any. Demand is down for gasoline with changes in energy, so Venezuela might be better off to look at changes in what they are doing with their crude supply. Maybe favor tech related products instead of fuel?
2265 2018-12-20 20:20:46 We're only one year out from our RV oil special where you and I agreed real trouble was coming in the medium term. And here we are. Oil will surely have some rally-spikes from here on out but demand *growth* outlook only gets worse from here.
2266 2018-12-20 20:20:45 So I got this little to no oil fryer that I left at my moms and I’m finally using it lol. I can’t wait to take it home ima use it all the time and it comes with a lil cook book
2267 2018-12-20 20:20:45 Saying "Coal is Clean" Is like sayin "Crude Oil is white"
2268 2018-12-20 20:20:40 Yes, but all that oil you guys have are more strategic than for trade, whether  locally or internationally, the USA keep it as reserves, so they can be influential in such an important market.
2269 2018-12-20 20:20:40 Once again, it is shown how fragile our system and infrastructure are. Remember a hand full of truckers brought UK to it's knees peacefully? They blockaded oil refineries. Today #drones closed #Gatwick
2270 2018-12-20 20:20:39 You seem to have become an Alberta oil industry mouthpiece, as are most of the major Canadian media outlets.
2271 2018-12-20 20:20:37 "are there any interesting jobs that dont require a doctorate and pay me less than my dad got as a dispatcher for an oil field casing company"
2272 2018-12-20 20:20:33 Putin loves that your withdrawing from Syria. All those new lovely oil reserves in Deir Ezzor you’ve just given him. #Trumpski
2273 2018-12-20 20:20:33 Та ты просто тащер
2274 2018-12-20 20:20:31 Did Anna paint those eyebrows with oil pain? Asking for someone  #DateMyFamillyZambia
2275 2018-12-20 20:20:23 Why are dark skinned models always covered in oil?
2276 2018-12-20 20:20:18 Mike it will be funded in the same way that oil & gas subsidies and the excess portion of military  are funded now. An intended consequence of  #greenNewDeal is people get well-paying jobs & pay taxes. What do we get for subsidizing oil & gas billionaries?
2277 2018-12-20 20:20:11 And no. The oil crash was not the fault of Trudeau and Notley. 
It is the result of global over-supply, the US increasing their own production, and a multitude of historical and international factors.
2278 2018-12-20 20:20:06 や、それ 妹から貰ったお守り捨てたりとかしたらサマを殺して私も死ぬ(ヤンデレか？)
2279 2018-12-20 20:20:06 So there is news that the @realDonaldTrump administration is planning on letting oil and gas companies run rampant on Arctic areas...  my one question is...

Who the fuck gives them rights to the Arctic?
2280 2018-12-20 20:19:52 Not made with palm oil
2281 2018-12-20 20:19:45 Today @BLMNational released the draft EIS for the oil & gas leasing program in ANWR.

2285 2018-12-20 20:19:24 Um, oil demand is up actually, and forecasted to do so in the future.  Benchmark price is down from two months ago, but up from two years ago.  Differentials are wider than ever.

2291 2018-12-20 20:18:54 That's because Saudi Arabia has lowered the cost for the time being. Oil will go up again next month.

2293 2018-12-20 20:18:46 We were told we were at peak oil in the early 70's. World production is now probably 10 times that amount.
2294 2018-12-20 20:18:35 I told you before that you the religion's war of fight terrorism and forgot way happened in porma and eghour and Turkestan and the reality of fight is politics and fake war for business of oil you play for Russia like idiot and sorry that and Palestine problem is against you
2295 2018-12-20 20:18:34 Albertans need to get out of entitlement mode esp in @OilGasCanada sector. Such a bunch of whining, self serving folks I've never seen. Folks in other sectors unemployed and have to fend for themselves but the oil folks seem to think they should get everything. Dumb.

2309 2018-12-20 20:17:10 I had to go to three different mechanic shops for an oil change and an inspection before my drive home tomorrow and finally the last place was like it’ll take maybe thirty minutes is that okay???? And I about yelled YES

2317 2018-12-20 20:16:50 Yall gone judge me but idc. 
So I picked up the castor oil from the laxative aisle, to see if it worked the same on my hair, and it does.
Its literally cold pressed and the same as any other castor oil, its just labeled as a laxative cause that's what it can be used for
2318 2018-12-20 20:16:41 Remember how Trump opened up Drilling in the United States so now we don't need to take anybody's oil?

2321 2018-12-20 20:16:32 So it just barely did so. What I had was in June. Crude oil has dropped in stock market about 4.8 %. That's probably the cause. If stock market improves. I've heard the U.S mostly stores its oil or exports it, just in case.

2338 2018-12-20 20:14:54 Palm oil?
2339 2018-12-20 20:14:54 Also ironic, is that that same price collusion made US fracking profitable causing a US oil boom which is now making it impossible for OPEC to bring prices up to where they want them..

2341 2018-12-20 20:14:44 Don't forget how the US built an oil refinery the year after his death, and how Americans haven't complained about "gas" since. Obama did what Bush couldn't.
2342 2018-12-20 20:14:43 This is the Red Herring. That was fine. But the other stuff... trying to get inside info on opponents legal strat, infiltrating protest groups for the oil/gas industry...
2343 2018-12-20 20:14:39 And oil fell off a cliff , can’t wait to see the price of gas now .

2396 2018-12-20 20:10:01 Actually, pipelines are EXACTLY the fix to the problem.  The benchmark price of oil fluctuates, but the issue is a wide basis to Canadian oil since there isn't enough capacity to get it to the demand.

2422 2018-12-20 20:07:40 Over 10 years working in this Oil & Gas industry and I can’t remember this time of year being so busy. Really looking forward to the Christmas holidays now to get a rest
2423 2018-12-20 20:07:35 @jacksoncrompton I have just read your letter to CNRL. I have to say that your lack of understanding of issues and complete hypocrisy when it comes to oil and gas are staggering. You and people like you are contributing to the $80m/day lost by Canada and handing it over to the US
2424 2018-12-20 20:07:32 You are so right, no one at pasta until the 1970s and that’s why Pioppians are so annoyed when people try to deny that they have always lived off coconut oil and cauliflower pizza. #Pioppi

for anxiety, PTSD, etc. Just started taking it yesterday. Until I retire from dentistry, I don't think anything will help my anxiety. Dentists are brutal to work for.

2460 2018-12-20 20:03:46 It worked for the past 50 years, and oil demand is going to only increase as China, India and developing nations get richer and can afford cars. There is still 100 years of growth potential for oil and gas for direct consumption and 200-300 years for plastics & other derivatives

2475 2018-12-20 20:02:02 America is now the largest exporter of oil in the world. We don't need foreign oil.
2476 2018-12-20 20:01:45 I don't think you know the definition of treason. I am all for getting oil to tide waters but this was a poorly planned shit show. They would have been better to arrange to meet with supporters in B.C. because until they okay the pipeline. Its dead at the boarder.
2477 2018-12-20 20:01:45 Canada would benefit from a cross-canada electrical grid that lets Quebec sell hydropower west and let's BC sell it east. We would also benefit from a full and integrated Nationwide pipeline. Need capacity in Qc refineries to futther upgrade Western heavy oil for sale elsewhere.

2490 2018-12-20 20:01:08 Left field? It has been 2 years of Trump appeasing Putin. It isn’t a shock anymore it is expected. Why was Iran given a waiver to sell oil to China, India and virtually everyone but EU because Iran is allies of Putin.

2544 2018-12-20 19:56:29 Try coconut oil.
2545 2018-12-20 19:56:18 Can't fault you blaming big oil companies. They're responsible, directly/indirectly  for most of world's turmoil for last 50 yrs. Like it or not, nations have to learn how to work with these bastards. Chavez and Maduro replaced privileged elite of old.  New paradigm needed.
2546 2018-12-20 19:56:07 Then that isn't a very good doctor. Also, for things like psoriasis there are many over the counter and non-pharmaceutical things (like coconut oil which is all I need to keep it in check) to recommend before going to a drug that can cause other bigger problems.
2547 2018-12-20 19:55:57 That's not the point I was trying to get at.  You said 'they are both bad because they both pollute.  The point is the amount of their pollution. You later changed on this when you claimed Alberta does not pollute much outside of oil and gas.  So, you already are aware of that.
2548 2018-12-20 19:55:54 I put like 4 pumps of oil in my hair and I used to only do half a pump. But my hair is so frizzy and breaks off a lot right now, maybe this will help... It feels softer already!

2550 2018-12-20 19:55:26 Nope he has a R after his name.  Which means  the "left" would call him a warmonger and chant no blood for oil.
2551 2018-12-20 19:55:15 The only way to get oil production to decrease is to socialize the oil industries, like Venezuela did to theirs.
2552 2018-12-20 19:55:15 But the point stands: there is foreign ownership in the oil sands, foreign money, foreign influence.
2553 2018-12-20 19:55:03 Hi Steven Pinker: I've lived for a long time, for each time, on surface of this planet, & my real DOB: May 557-before year 1,000,& there was electricity & oil heat & everything of what is of 1970's back then in Europe,but bad people destroyed a lot. Lorrie Tabitha James.
2554 2018-12-20 19:55:01 People in the oil industry always experience mass layoffs around this time of year, and even more during the muddy season of spring thaw. Oil Rigging is seasonal work - always been that way. #abpoli #cdnpoli #pipedream #poisonisreal #conspicuousconsumption

2582 2018-12-20 19:52:27 It’s not about recession.  It’s about rate of change of slowing growth, higher USD & wages which squeeze margins.  Also have Inflation coming down with oil collapsing and earnings wil follow that path for energy.  Can’t get the same growth rate with those headwinds.

2650 2018-12-20 19:45:55 Much like 2007 when Bush cabinet arranged for Russia to cease oil flow (using scuffle & pipeline disruption as excuse) while Fed quickly raised rates. This is why POTUS wants increased oil production to keep inflation low.

2665 2018-12-20 19:44:37 It is a costly stay to start with. After all politics is about finances at the end of the day. Oil is still sold in $ , strengthening the USA economy. Sanctions are more effective and cheaper
2666 2018-12-20 19:44:27 @KevinBrennanMP appreciate your letter and sending me the Minister’s response to the use of dirty palm oil in UK. Much more to do of course but good to see UK are working to improve things.
2667 2018-12-20 19:44:23 No, it’s not foolish at all. Electric batteries are recyclable and the tech is being improved every day. In BC we use hydro electric and California has mandated that all new builds be equipped with solar panels. You see, there are solutions. Oil and Gas are not part of it.

2672 2018-12-20 19:44:00 Again, everything you wrote is wrong. Oil is not more expensive in the U.S. than in the Middle East. The U.S. produces more oil than any country in the Middle East and is a net exporter of oil. You know next to nothing about the global market for oil.

2676 2018-12-20 19:43:49 I spray my sheets with some stress relief oil, v nice touch  (◡ ‿ ◡ ✿).
2677 2018-12-20 19:43:44 Now playing I Need Your Oil by E. Dewey Smith, Jr. & The House of Hope Atlanta!
2678 2018-12-20 19:43:42 Oil 45.96
2679 2018-12-20 19:43:39 2/ Near & longer term, for as long as CNY oil contract continues gaining share, the key to global oil prices will be the CNY/USD cross rate.  If the US does not want its shale sector & industrial sector to collapse, it will need to deval the USD, significantly.
2680 2018-12-20 19:43:38 NO, You're not looking at it objectively !! Ever heard of OIL & innocent people Assad & Russia are killing ?
2681 2018-12-20 19:43:37 Funny how you want those jobs privatized, because free market and capitalism...yet that same free market put the oil industry where it is.
Careful. Your hypocrisy is showing.
2682 2018-12-20 19:43:27 Hannukkah, God gives you some oil.
With this oil you can see the movie "A Christmas Carol".
2683 2018-12-20 19:43:24 WTI oil continues to slide lower at $46/barrel, -$2.17.
2684 2018-12-20 19:43:15 We could all have FREE clean energy and all of you bastards up on the hill have known it for years! Oil producers need to start learning how to eat sand! I've driven General Motors prototypes that run on water!!
2685 2018-12-20 19:43:06 @jiffylube expected to get my oil changed; left with tires topped off & rotated, floors vacuumed! Super customer service from Amber & Joseph-the-rock-star at Waldorf, MD store.

I have a couple of suggestions... Please dm me.
2686 2018-12-20 19:43:04 My oil glands be on “ you” I swear 
2687 2018-12-20 19:43:02 I bought my aunt fancy herb olive oil in one of those stores where you fill the bottles yourself; naturally I proceeded to fail utterly at this task, and now my coat will smell like an Italian restaurant until the end of time
2688 2018-12-20 19:42:58 We no longer need their oil. What else do they have besides Israel that is worth fighting for??
2689 2018-12-20 19:42:42 WTI oil $45.96

2691 2018-12-20 19:42:28 One year ago, Congress directed @Interior to open the Coastal Plain for responsible energy development. Today, @BLMNational released the draft environmental impact statement for the oil and gas leasing program on the Coastal Plain of ANWR.
2692 2018-12-20 19:42:27 Not worth it, since I have the same Defi boost gauge, I'll just look for that oil temp one
2693 2018-12-20 19:42:26 McCain and Graham wanted this war from the start.  Saudis want this territory as do others to trek oil where they need it to go. Not our problem!
2694 2018-12-20 19:42:18 Lol that's why I'm broke ... V-power n synthetic oil changes catching up
2695 2018-12-20 19:41:53 Snake oil sales team!

The estimated revenue of #SDF (#PYD/#PKK)  that could be earned from energy trade: 8.5 billion dollar
2704 2018-12-20 19:41:09 They are probably being paid by coal and oil to prop up collapsing shareholder value with this nonsense...
2705 2018-12-20 19:41:09 Need to oil my joints again. I swear, sometimes I feel like the tin man from the wizard of oz =A=
2706 2018-12-20 19:40:51 corporations create the need for their own products. see: oil companies suppressing alternative energy funding and research to keep demand up
2707 2018-12-20 19:40:44 here's a response you could give that wouldn't be a red flag: "Thanks for pointing out that this reads like snake oil. That wasn't our intention, and it didn't read that way to us. We'll see what we can do to make it clearer."

Fighting words and ad hominem: not as good.
2708 2018-12-20 19:40:43 I really need a boyfriend. The only reason being because I need someone to tell me when my car is broken. Within this last month, I’ve blown a hose and my water heater, ran out of oil, had two flat tires and now I need my break pads changed... happy holidays to me.
2709 2018-12-20 19:40:37 My favorite oil!

2713 2018-12-20 19:40:07 Endless oil story
2714 2018-12-20 19:40:05 No the cause of Venezuelas bankrupcy is that they didnt save on the oil boom when oil was at 120 if Chavez had save money we could at least navigate these low prices and had invested in other forms of income.

2719 2018-12-20 19:39:55 Putin wants his oil and gas pipelines. That's why he's aligning himself with, Saudis, Turkey and Syria and Trump is complicit. This also generates more money for arms sales from US and Russia.
2720 2018-12-20 19:39:52 Trust it’s nothing 
If we play short
We will make oil price above 100 dollar !
Do you know what it’s mean?
If not better to ask Mr president
2721 2018-12-20 19:39:50 PETRODOLLAR if any one tries to sell oil with anything else ,they become a monster with weapons of mass destruction
2722 2018-12-20 19:39:42 I'm not anti-oil/gas. I'm pro-diversification. Take these oil workers, train them for renewable energy sources, and you'll have sustainable jobs and development
2723 2018-12-20 19:39:41 LET'S
END THE
AGE OF OIL
2724 2018-12-20 19:39:40 We also wouldn’t have had an embargo choking off the Japanese from oil or froze their assets
2725 2018-12-20 19:39:35 I get it now... when I say "no cheese" at a fast food place and I end up with "cheese" jokes on me... it's actually american cheese product aka vegetable oil product.... so I guess I really did get "no cheese"
2726 2018-12-20 19:39:34 .@TheTalk should start and end every episode with “We hope your oil change is going well.”
2727 2018-12-20 19:39:33 Beto O’Rourke is a phony Progressive, a wolf in sheep’s clothing.  He is bought and paid for by big oil, AIPAC, and much more.

2728 2018-12-20 19:39:25 I love cooking with Peanut Oil.
2729 2018-12-20 19:39:21 Do not put butter or oil on the burns as it may trap heat &amp; cause burns to worsen. Instead hold the burnt area under cold running water.
2730 2018-12-20 19:39:18 Head of National Oil Corporation (#NOC) #MustafaSanalla said that NOC needs radical solutions not temporary reforms.

2731 2018-12-20 19:39:13 Oh yes, & first time ever, we have trade surplus with Saudis, partly because we are producing more gas and oil than we need & therefore exporting both.  Renegotiated NAFTA to get us more money and now Trump is after China, who is ripping us off. All this is why economy is raging
2732 2018-12-20 19:39:06 Crude oil price has dropped nearly 40% in nine weeks. $76 to $46. Hello volatility, my old friend.
2733 2018-12-20 19:39:05 This oil pen so clutch

2736 2018-12-20 19:39:00 that eco style with the cannibis sativa oil is my new second fave.
2737 2018-12-20 19:38:50 This is deceptive spin to hide the fact that you are doing Putin’s bidding, handing him the Azar oil field and betraying our Kurd allies to please Erdagon. Putin says he’s pleased. #DonaldDezinformatsya
2738 2018-12-20 19:38:47 Some African nations have oil what r they managing to do... giv it to Chinese u don't have oil still they r in your country and u can have a look around the world where they r what r they doing... your countdown is on ... tick tok tick....
2739 2018-12-20 19:38:34 I don’t feel good and then someone is frying something. The smell of the oil is making me feel worse 
2740 2018-12-20 19:38:33 got my oil changed  king crimson is ready 2 go
2741 2018-12-20 19:38:30 We are now an exporter of oil. We no longer have to have our own military killed to make blood money for the RINO war hawks! Protect the homeland! Secure ALL points of entry!! Great job @realDonaldTrump !! My President!!
2742 2018-12-20 19:38:28 Yesss! The farm bill is getting signed in like 2 minutes!! Celebrate Federally Legal CBD oil!! Woohoo!!
2743 2018-12-20 19:38:27 Lots happening in the world of offshore oil - Clean Cape Fear is following and will occasionally post on that topic but we encourage those interested to follow Surfrider Foundation Cape Fear Chapter for the latest updates.
2744 2018-12-20 19:38:12 Did he follow Putin's instructions when he decided to sell our oil nope. Did he follow Putin's instructions when he didn't get rid of the Saudi nuclear arms deal so Putin could have it nope. Trump armed Saudi Rebels they killed Russian soldiers you're fake news
2745 2018-12-20 19:38:08 Very true... and they make a lot less money with a 4 year post secondary education. In large part, oil workers make a heck of a lot of $$(rightfully so btw) but it is and always be a volatile industry and unfortunately this is part of it. I wish it was different.
2746 2018-12-20 19:38:00 You can call it a "landscape" if you want but it's a frozen wasteland. If "green" people want to donate a big part of their income to subsidize energy costs at the level they would be with access to this oil so drilling not needed, go for it! Or else shut up!
2747 2018-12-20 19:37:57 America has oil right here.  Why do we need to be in other countries?
2748 2018-12-20 19:37:54 Чел, ты просто прекрасен
Тебе просто невероятно идёт макияж. А ещё мне очень нравится, как уложены твои волосы. Ты просто невероятно красив)
2749 2018-12-20 19:37:46 avg drunk pizza, hot oil is a must
2750 2018-12-20 19:37:42 good. maybe oil will go to 10 dollars a barrel ! that will make his base happy !
2751 2018-12-20 19:37:38 I used to work on the industry until the most recent downturn. Just because people have a low bullshit tolerance doesn't mean they are anti oil.
2752 2018-12-20 19:37:33 I find the idea of people being ignorant to using products that aren’t biodegradable, products with palm oil, or stuffing meat down their faces at every meal quite stressful. Why don’t people give a shit about the state they are leaving the planet in. You love your kids right????

2755 2018-12-20 19:37:28 Hey bby. How about you grab that motor oil gurl. @RaineSN7
2756 2018-12-20 19:37:22 Nothing like a nice canola oil foot bath
2757 2018-12-20 19:37:20 I take oil on my Italian hoagie, mayo on others.
2758 2018-12-20 19:37:16 There are still thousands of trucks needed for oil and gas development. While automation took some of those jobs away, it is still a fraction of what’s out there. What will be a real threat to their careers is when automation comes to long haul trucking.
2759 2018-12-20 19:37:11 WOW... Young Living will have CBD Oil 2019!   Gimme Me a Holla! 
2760 2018-12-20 19:37:08 USA will just take the oil.

2762 2018-12-20 19:36:57 It's not our oil.
2763 2018-12-20 19:36:53 So I just heard that CBD oil is coming to Young Living!  I will update you all as I find out more.   This should be interesting!   A few posts ago I posted about the difference between CBD and essential oils....worth it to go back and take a read!
2764 2018-12-20 19:36:52 Some Cdn oil stocks will be the buy of the decade now or soon if you have the guts to go in and buy a wide list. A few will fail but a few will be 5-10 baggers.
2765 2018-12-20 19:36:49 You voted for him in the first place, you got sold by a shyster, a snake oil salesmen, you deserve the shame and guilt you feel @AnnCoulter, all of it. I hope you like the artistic style of your steel slats.
2766 2018-12-20 19:36:40 What's false about it? That oil is cheaper in the M.E or that it's more expensive in the U.S? There's plenty of info that proves both of those. It's more expensive to make it here. We can't drill it fast enough either. U.S steel tripled prices, I expect no less from oil comp.
2767 2018-12-20 19:36:28 Must be nice. It’s taken them 26 hours to do an oil change and tire rotation 
2768 2018-12-20 19:36:19 I believe that right now you get a wise man . 
Stop fighting for oil .
2769 2018-12-20 19:36:14 I feel like people who harp on about ethnic food don't ever eat it - ie. the way they talk about levantine food as if its not just buckets of olive oil mixed with spices
2770 2018-12-20 19:36:11 We should fall late on our oil payments to them
2771 2018-12-20 19:36:08 Oil dude on TV in a panic.
2772 2018-12-20 19:35:59 China is the largest consumer of OUR oil. Thank you President Trump!
2773 2018-12-20 19:35:50 Play short 
OPEC should reduce the offer to raise the price of oil to more than one hundred dollars and all that the price is lower production so that the price remains high
2774 2018-12-20 19:35:26 What makes me feel #limitless is being able to prevent/stop my daughter's seizures with CBD oil!!! To be able to make that life saving decision for her feels #limitless 
2775 2018-12-20 19:35:24 I know...ORORO means no oil in English
2776 2018-12-20 19:35:20 Oil blotting sheets are an essential
2777 2018-12-20 19:35:20 Yuk instant migraine  all those competing scents . I don't wear anything but a little jasmine oil because store bought smells terrible to me .
2778 2018-12-20 19:35:11 today is the day I should really really try the cbd oil I think,
2779 2018-12-20 19:35:02 Lol it’s true . My cousin used so much oil & shit and still got them. I didn’t put on shit and didn’t get not even one 
2780 2018-12-20 19:34:48 We’re only fighting with them because we want the oil! Trump said it himself in the debates! We don’t have any genuine humanitarian interest, it’s all imperialist garbage. And why does ISIS exist in the first place? The sooner we’re out of the Middle East the better.
2781 2018-12-20 19:34:41 Spicy anything. Usually spaghetti with olive oil, garlic, pancetta and lots of chilli flakes
2782 2018-12-20 19:34:40 Watch out for Russ.  He's the new Rob only on olive oil.
2783 2018-12-20 19:34:35 That's Syria's oil actually
2784 2018-12-20 19:34:34 That pipeline would still be sending the oil out of Canada.
2785 2018-12-20 19:34:14 Take Robert Oil'Rourke off the list. I would say Joe too, but we all know that's a joke.
2786 2018-12-20 19:34:12 Check out Seb Gorka calling Q a snake oil salesman

2788 2018-12-20 19:34:01 Hahaha that's brutal. Our last house had a oil furnace and I watched those levels like a hawk.
2789 2018-12-20 19:33:59 Keep the Parks open and stop destroying them or selling them to big oil. They're here for a reason which obviously you don't understand. Face it, you're never getting a wall and keep the government open.

2801 2018-12-20 19:32:34 So I’m getting my oil changed & inspection right? I can see my car and I swear before the guy got out he pulled the perfume bottle out of the side of my door and smelled it....

2808 2018-12-20 19:31:55 Thanks for clearing the area for Russian exploitation of gas and oil assets. Putin knew what he was doing when he put you in office.
2809 2018-12-20 19:31:49 At any point did you think to yourself, “why don’t we just take our chances with the oil leak?”
2810 2018-12-20 19:31:48 My mom keeps asking what to get us for Christmas. I said olive oil, salt or something from @PenzeysSpices ....do I tell her? Maybe she’ll notice when she’s inside  #nevertrump

2812 2018-12-20 19:31:42 We are pretty sure that the paper market for Oil is 800x larger than physical oil. You will never find an actual clearing price for the commodity - only how traders are set up.
2813 2018-12-20 19:31:33 War won’t stop, but it won’t be our war anymore. And as much as we need the Saudi oil, the Saudi’s need our markets. Their oils is just black sludge without America’s oil demand. They aren’t going to let anything damage their cash cow.

2817 2018-12-20 19:31:18 I heard stretch marks are genetic, so when I get pregnant one day and drench myself in baby oil and only drink water and I get stretch marks. It’s gone be a problem.
2818 2018-12-20 19:31:14 The difference is that they HAVE JOBS and there is always a NEED for education whereas we are fighting for work and our lively hoods. We are fight to get our oil to market and be relevant in the global market and not sell our oil for pennies. Teachers strike and bargain a CBA...
2819 2018-12-20 19:31:11 Very cool, looks like he could make Armada Tidalwave oil himself in fear
2820 2018-12-20 19:31:10 What about the oil and gas industry ?. Dairy products are more of a treat than a need. We need oil and gas.
2821 2018-12-20 19:31:10 All of a sudden everybody seems to want air fryers. A magic device that uses hot air instead of oil to cook foods. How come no one thought of this before? Now i can get rid of that pesky oven i have in my kitchen.

2822 2018-12-20 19:31:05 What is that saying...the squeaky wheel gets the oil.  It sucks.  I'm bitter.
2823 2018-12-20 19:30:54 What's missing is determining the amount of CO2 emissions in CREATING gasoline and not just using it.

The production of fuel from crude oil is not exactly a clean process and petroleum plants aren't connected to solar or wind fields.
2824 2018-12-20 19:30:47 Hey can you point me in the right direction to learn about algae oil? I watched Paul stamets on joe Rogan a while back. This sounds like huge potential to heal the planet.
2825 2018-12-20 19:30:43 Lol what?
2826 2018-12-20 19:30:39 Better keep drilling for oil in spite of obvious alternatives that could be explored instead of continuing to set the planet on fire. But you know, whatever.
2827 2018-12-20 19:30:37 I know but I’m getting new tires oil change and inspection so I’ve got nothing better to do than roast him
2828 2018-12-20 19:30:31 That’s the same fucker that destroyed nikola Tesla’s wardenclyff towers to exploit coal and oil for his monopoly greed, we could have been living in 3019
2829 2018-12-20 19:30:29 Though you don't have to buy oil that way. You could just buy far dated futures and roll those less frequently at less cost.
2830 2018-12-20 19:30:28 Rapeseed is better for cooking & olive oil for drizzling & dipping . Rapeseed doesn't contain as many polyphenols/antioxidants as Olive oil. No Union Jacks in my Cretan oil

2833 2018-12-20 19:30:05 Oil is dropping like a rock.....guess nobody is paying attention to that...
2834 2018-12-20 19:30:01 I have been at the car dealership for 2 HOURS just for an oil change.
2835 2018-12-20 19:29:59 SIR please give me peri EPIC grape juice olive oil victorias secret perfume i want to a slenderman x reader in like...
2836 2018-12-20 19:29:56 SDF and Assad will re-negotiate deals over the oil fields, and SDF never had much interest in running major infrastructure anyways.

The main enemy for Syria for next 5 years will be expelling Turks from Idlib & other areas that have been seized, having SDF pressure Tuks helps.
2837 2018-12-20 19:29:54 barrel of crude oil (WTI) would be cheaper
2838 2018-12-20 19:29:52 There is some kind of science behind cold wet potato hitting hot spitting oil, the outside crisps up like an actual crisp, and the inside stays squishy-fluffy-soft. Not _quite_ as great as regular hasselbacks but not far off in a pinch.  Tag me when you do them! Xx
2839 2018-12-20 19:29:47 Rose water has anti inflammatory properties. It also helps reduce appearance and occurrence of acne. This is a toner so it has ingredients that will help w pore tightening, oil reducing, skin balancing, and hydration! It helps keep my skin clear no matter what’s going on
2840 2018-12-20 19:29:42 Much of that comes from corporate tax and from 59% of oil revenues. Once again, it does NOT go directly to Quebec. It goes into a pool and is distributed accordingly from there.
2841 2018-12-20 19:29:40 peak oil might put a stop to the emission problem. but theyve been promising the oil will run out since the 70s
2842 2018-12-20 19:29:38 Everyone remember check your damn brakes, get your fucking oil change, stay hydrated and take your veggies. Live smart. 
2843 2018-12-20 19:29:34 Yeah I mean what harm has the gas or oil industry ever done? Amirite?
2844 2018-12-20 19:29:23 I feel like I totally just got my oil changed but here I am again.
2845 2018-12-20 19:29:22 I didn’t use any oil.
2846 2018-12-20 19:29:21 Helps get smooth and oil free skin: Beat one egg-white until stiff w/ lemon juice. Apply on your skin for 20 mins. Rinse w/ lukewarm water.
2847 2018-12-20 19:29:17 Exactly. Compounded by the recent news that cleaning up is more difficult than originally thought. How many oil patch corps will simply slink away in the night...
2848 2018-12-20 19:29:06 And even with buying oil, we can still do that regardless, china doesn't need to occupy everywhere they buy thing from,money speaks
2849 2018-12-20 19:29:02 Dang, nice free plug for Waste Oil Recyclers 
2850 2018-12-20 19:28:50 Do you sheep realize or even stop for a second to think about the 500,000+
Human beings that have been killed in this countries civil war?
ISIS had a vast network of oil, money and solders...
That has been eradicated, US Soldiers should not get involved in the civil war!
WAKE UP!
2851 2018-12-20 19:28:33 Oil changes, brakes, tire rotaions hmu
2852 2018-12-20 19:28:31 The oil isn’t produced for our consumption. It’s produced to be sold outside of Canada. Perhaps Alberta should be a little smarter about how it allows its resources to be extracted. Opting for the fastest, easiest buck is what got them in the situation they’re in.
2853 2018-12-20 19:28:25 Russia’s Agricultural exports to hit $25 billion in 2018,GMO free food,Grain&stuff,RUSSIA the WORLD's richest country in 2018,gazprom,alrosa,diamonds,rosneft,novatek,sberbank,Food,gas,oil,2018...........tbc?

2855 2018-12-20 19:28:21 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
2856 2018-12-20 19:28:07 Mine was a GT 100 (showing my age). Glenn Turner. You know, when you had to oil your bat and knock it in....
2857 2018-12-20 19:28:03 This has been ALL ABOUT an oil pipeline.......McCaun created ISIS with Obama......Trump got rid of almost all of it.   Nothing a bunch of laser guided weapons wont take care of.
2858 2018-12-20 19:27:54 Hey @Europcar_UK the car you’ve lent me says it’s oil needs changing. And generally isn’t very good (slow, noisy, uncomfortable). Any chance of a swap?
2859 2018-12-20 19:27:54 They need to go fridge-cold into a hot roasting tin with hot oil, 180 for 30ish minutes. Shake once or twice. Remove into paper-lined bowl to seep excess oil, dunk into dip of choice. Pesto, tarama, ketchup all work well. Need to be eaten immediately, which isn't a hardship imo x
2860 2018-12-20 19:27:44 I want to eat multigrain bread with olive oil spread 
2861 2018-12-20 19:27:37 Since you know so much about economies you know that there are lagging indicators. Someone doesn't just walk in on Jan 20th and own everything that's happening in the economy. He hasn't even been in 2 years and markets are crashing, oil is out of control, wages barely increasing.
2862 2018-12-20 19:27:36 There will be a 4h downtime starting at 11pm UTC to tighten some nuts and bolts and oil the machine.
2863 2018-12-20 19:27:29 A Liverpool fan jealous of Manchester City? What’s there to be jealous of? Your UCL’s? Your League titles? Your illegal oil money? Your fraudulent chequebook manager? Your second place? 

City are hands down the worst fan base on this platform 
2864 2018-12-20 19:27:28 #UKOG it's just bloody lovely to see. They ain't wasting time on planning if it's not gonna be a great set of results and CPR... people will soon wake up to the alarm bell ringing. OIL GALORE! OIL GALORE!!!
2865 2018-12-20 19:27:28 Damn you got all the $$$ oil, arms n war profit you got... yet they are enemies? Fig lif job. You shall be judged on account.
2866 2018-12-20 19:27:12 The effects you call gravity really are density buoyancy and the type of medium an object is falling through so water air oil etc.
2867 2018-12-20 19:26:59 I ain't tryna smell no straight tea tree oil!!
2868 2018-12-20 19:26:58 Oil
2869 2018-12-20 19:26:51 Dow now is down -3500 pts and this 2.5 weeks since this started, why is it that is dragging on the markets besides the Hugh debt that no one is very concerned with. How about Oil down to $46 or the lies Trump has been taking about? Maybe we have no gold standard for protection?
2870 2018-12-20 19:26:48 But how are you going to start wars that fuel your munitions companies and secure oil supplies now?
2871 2018-12-20 19:26:46 Greener and cleaner? Nope. And yes, I am well aware, we are reliant on oil products. And again, that is why I am hoping for everyone to look into greener ways to wean us off. I fear that you assume a lot about my views. In any case, change is coming and we need to all be prepared
2872 2018-12-20 19:26:44 If it was to to bomb some poor country with oil vote would have happened already. Cutting benefits done. Taking the blame for enabling the WH nah.
2873 2018-12-20 19:26:40 My brother takes the oil and it is working wonders for him
2874 2018-12-20 19:26:40 Listen, @KrazyEssentials dry body oil has my skin so soft right now. I should’ve stayed home and cuddled with myself
2875 2018-12-20 19:26:20 Kaka kbi sindh a oil khasbu lga k
2876 2018-12-20 19:26:08 @YoungMAMusic yo wassup with my brake pads and oil change?
2877 2018-12-20 19:26:05 No oil, no shine perhaps.
2878 2018-12-20 19:26:05 I wanted to say the same thing and to think the excess crude oil a/c has been deplited by this admin, makes one wonder what the a/c balance of the nation would look like when they leave office and also what the debt owed would stand at.
2879 2018-12-20 19:26:01 I swear  she fit make u drink full bottle of anointing oil
2880 2018-12-20 19:25:47 Unfortunately they don't . Had customers finish off a quart each today while they waited on an oil change.
2881 2018-12-20 19:25:38 جب بھی oil drilling کی جاتی ہے،اس سے قبل Geological survey ہوتا ہے،اسکا باقاعدہ data ہوتا ہے اور اس data کی بنیاد پر drilling company اپنا رِگ لیکر آتی ہے!

پہلے گیس نکلتی ہے اور پھر خام تیل!

خان صاحب پتہ نہیں کونسی ڈرلنگ اور کونسی گیس لیکچ کی بات کر رہے... 
2882 2018-12-20 19:25:22 And Oil has again done it. Down 5% again!! #OOTT 
Stocks are further lower after news that Trump won't sign the stop gap bill. Maybe, this time the stocks are going to show what a shutdown means for sentiment
2883 2018-12-20 19:25:20 It’s all just cardboard, shaving foam, car oil and lies
2884 2018-12-20 19:25:19 In 2010, Thieves cause an explosion of an oil pipeline in Puebla state, killing 26 people including themselves.
2885 2018-12-20 19:24:59 Any one know how much readily exploitable or already pumping oil fields are in the area because this, nothing else, will decide whether SAA/NDF even remain in the area ti be honest...
2886 2018-12-20 19:24:54 This is the second time he (Sebastian Gorka) has posted this - the first time, he quoted (incorrectly) a post from an ANON - NOT Q, thinking the post was from Q, said it did not come to pass and therefore Q is a snake oil salesman  # QAnon
2887 2018-12-20 19:24:48 Shut up which oil must be rude
2888 2018-12-20 19:24:48 In ADQ 7/1 there was a scenario called Black Gold Blues that used Boat Wars rules with the Armadillo Autoduel Arena map to simulate an attack on a floating oil drilling platform. :o)
2889 2018-12-20 19:24:44 And Trum-I mean Big Oil wants to kill all the tax breaks for buying electric. 

So they can point to declining sales and say "See? Nobody wants electric"
2890 2018-12-20 19:24:41 The oil mehn
2891 2018-12-20 19:24:34 #oott:  With the USD sliding along with oil, I would think that it would add support to WTI.
2892 2018-12-20 19:24:33 350,000 people landing on the planet, oil  consumption increasing at least for the next two decades, (News Scientist Nov 18th) causing continued rise of CO2 levels.
2893 2018-12-20 19:24:32 So you have no problem with the snake oil salesperson being a billionaire...? Bah Bah Bah
2894 2018-12-20 19:24:30 one of 25 schools with a billion $ or more endowment.  I think oil has something to do with the money too. btw, I'm not talking lifestyles of rich and famous wealthy but upper class.

2905 2018-12-20 19:23:54 Perhaps those desperate people should get jobs working for companies that support Canadians. Fact is, Trudeau doesn’t choose to import from SA. Oil companies sell for the highest profit, which results in Canadian oil leaving Canada.

2909 2018-12-20 19:23:43 What's the point of fighting for a lost cause? Russia, Syria & Iran killed most of their trained & funded ISIS. The war for the pipelines is still on. I don't think the American military & oil industry have given up. Not yet. Just wait.
2910 2018-12-20 19:23:31 Right?? Coconut oil just seems the more logical option tbh. Love his work, but I'll stick to the care routine you and I know
2911 2018-12-20 19:23:24 Oil renews plunge, sending energy sector down 3%
2912 2018-12-20 19:23:17 No. I have chronic pain that CBD oil doesnt touch. Ive read on it and the THC content may make the difference because it is used to treat people like me in other states that allow it. My state doesnt. Some people just want a remotely normal life and are out of options.

If I was an oil I’d be a jojoba oil.
2918 2018-12-20 19:22:57 You created ISIS, you created Taliban against Russia, than you ran away, today you running away,  you wanted oil you took that, that's the line
2919 2018-12-20 19:22:55 And I hope Trudeau catches on that no matter how much free money he hands to the oil sector, they're still going to be a bunch of (profitable) crybabies who will be supporting the CONS through various front groups.
2920 2018-12-20 19:22:46 The only talent i see here is oil can b extracted from your face to sustain these Nation 
2921 2018-12-20 19:22:40 Same. I personally prefer coconut oil. Back in the day when I was using the lotion it healed slower and it hurt put on.
2922 2018-12-20 19:22:30  thanks Callum ! Taking some to France 
2923 2018-12-20 19:22:25 Can we subsidize transit, oil pipelines, electric cars and electricity production? How about 3/4?
2924 2018-12-20 19:22:12 Irony is that with US leaving, Turkish leverage on Trump is now zero.

Doubt Russia and SyAF are going to let Turks grab Syria Oil Fields like Erdogan wants to do.
2925 2018-12-20 19:22:08 Cut off? Did Trudeau shut down pipelines? No, he didn’t. While smart companies reduced production and maintained profit growth, others continued to extract more and more oil, resulting in a major oversupply. Further, the entire oil industry is seeing less demand and lower prices
2926 2018-12-20 19:22:06 Well didn't most of the conservatives lose their  seats from using tax payer money as thier own bank account. And Most of us Canadians dont work in oil in gas. I was a card carrying conservative since I was 18. But have learn the party is a party of fear know

2929 2018-12-20 19:21:47 A Snake Oil salesman, I’m surprised nobody has come up with this Airport Banter before this. I hope its one bloke who fucking hates the idea of Christmas Holidaymakers. One thing they can do is use another drone to twat that one out of the sky, but even thats a slim hope.
2930 2018-12-20 19:21:44 I don’t like trump.  But how can we have stagflation?  Where will pressure come from on prices?  Not labor cost!  Oil?  Nat gas?  As frackers with high debt fold?  But why would they fold with high prices?  If they stay it will put a cap on prices???
2931 2018-12-20 19:21:31 I've also heard coconut oil is poison
2932 2018-12-20 19:21:18 ‘You’re’ building the most powerful military?! Pretty sure the US spent more on military than the next 30 nations combined for decades, way before you duped the uneducated into buying your snake oil. You are why just some of that money desperately needs to be spent on education!

2936 2018-12-20 19:21:05 Okay but what is so essential about lavender oil
2937 2018-12-20 19:21:00 I love that when oil prices have tanked, Alberta now wants a national energy program but still hates anyone with the name Trudeau.
2938 2018-12-20 19:20:51 I'm just using coconut oil cause I don't have the riches for fancy lotion lol
2939 2018-12-20 19:20:44 Yes, but we use mostly Saudi's oil because it's cheaper and faster. If we didn't, gas prices would be $6 a gallon because we jack up prices.
2940 2018-12-20 19:20:33 Let me go to target rn, cause I’ve heard too much about bio oil
2941 2018-12-20 19:20:27 Russia and China are so mean to their citizens that as soon as they got a bit of money, they decided to invest in infrastructure. Those assholes! Don't they know how to make their citizens dependent on oil and the car industry?
2942 2018-12-20 19:20:19 And in oil prospection it's used in seismic survey.
2943 2018-12-20 19:20:13 The only free market present is for small business owners who sink and swim on their own. The big boys get major cash. Think the Harper bailouts of the car industry, the airline companies, @OilGasCanada We should have had a NEP. We've been screwed big time by the PCs and oil.

2945 2018-12-20 19:19:58 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
2946 2018-12-20 19:19:57 It’s almost 2019, oil is bad, unless you like focused TEM beams growing hydro-carbon contamination antlers on samples for a holiday card picture 
2947 2018-12-20 19:19:52 I am so over this oil change.
2948 2018-12-20 19:19:48 True. But the RX-8 is stupidly cheap if you ignore the appalling fuel economy and oil use.
2949 2018-12-20 19:19:48 You mean you don't like the overwhelming and nauseating smell of oil and rubber?
2950 2018-12-20 19:19:38 I’d cheer for the Oil if they were as good as the flames are right now, also if they gave out free tickets every game
2951 2018-12-20 19:19:34 big idea here: maybe beto should shape up and stop palling around with oil executives who are directly responsible for mass extinction! i feel like it's really, really easy to tell oil executives (arguably the most villainous of the executive class) to go piss up a fuckin rope
2952 2018-12-20 19:19:30 roll the bitch away is definitely the best essential oil
2953 2018-12-20 19:19:29 #Libya: In latest statement, NOC says it needs “real solutions for oil sector problems not quick temporary fixes.” #Sharara “closed” still
2954 2018-12-20 19:19:28 I'm gonna go with strawberry but chocolates are tasting more and more like arse the more palm oil they add 
2955 2018-12-20 19:19:21 Don't burn the myrrh   It will smell like Harpic.   Turn it into aromatic oil.
2956 2018-12-20 19:19:09 Every time I put coconut oil on my legs after a shower, I CANNOT stop touching them omg they’re so smooth
2957 2018-12-20 19:18:56 オイルだって、泣きたい時もある。

2960 2018-12-20 19:18:38 เชี้ยยยยยยย นอนนนนนนนนน
2961 2018-12-20 19:18:31 Who said $26 was too low? You?

Price discovery is based on an agreement between buyer and seller. If I can find someone to sell me oil at $26, why should I pay more? If I can't, then the price is too low. 

The fact that there were buyers & sellers at $26 disproves your premise.
2962 2018-12-20 19:18:28 ขอโทดที่ทำให้ร้องไห้ เราก็เสียใจไม่ต่างกัน ไม่น้อยกว่ากัน
2963 2018-12-20 19:18:27 And nothing can make up for the fact that the country is in hell neighbor against neighbor family against family he has put this country in hell

Why
2964 2018-12-20 19:18:22 When flashing means it needs an oil and filter change. When solid means a clean out.
2965 2018-12-20 19:18:18 You mean they can make anything or rip off anything, but can't make fake whale fat n oil..bs
2966 2018-12-20 19:18:11 I walked out of my room for 5 minutes and my dad slipped in the garage, the dog got out, it started raining and my mom spilled hot canola oil on her foot.
2967 2018-12-20 19:18:07 You should also do hot oil treatment, it’s very good for dry hair. @MissAcalaca please assist!
2968 2018-12-20 19:18:00 Green is coming! Only way into the future! Big Oil will be hard to beat!

2973 2018-12-20 19:17:22 My family keeps asking me what i want for Christmas. i told them nothing, save your money.

What i really want:
Full gas tank
2 weeks of grocery’s
& oil for my house
2974 2018-12-20 19:17:15 If investors are exclusively focused on only 401k, they won’t see benchmark US Tsy 10 year at 2.76% (50 bps lower than 1 month ago), lower rates help housing. $46 for a barrel of oil - looking at $1 $ change gas prices in 2019. With 22,000 in sight, close to 20% correction/bottom
2975 2018-12-20 19:17:13 US policies of past has ruined entire south Asia.
Every problem from oil price rise to terrorism has a US shadow over it. 
We were fine with Saddam even though his 2 sons were assholes. His exit gave birth to ISIS who r 100 times brutal than him. Taliban is US product too.
2976 2018-12-20 19:17:13 I was frying up an egg and the oil hit me right under my eye.
2977 2018-12-20 19:17:13 Google Cannabis Oil Extract bottles from 1850 and realize they're poisoning your water with Fluoride the base component for PROZAC. Hence Alzheimer's in young people now too. Cannabis Uncalcifys the Pineal Gland hence why they don't want you to have it. Made for Kings and Queens!
2978 2018-12-20 19:17:08 you're literally oil

2980 2018-12-20 19:16:55 I bought about a 100 dollars worth of oil and acrylic paints so I'm about to be painting my ass off and I got it for a good price like too cheap to leave in the store so I bought a lot 
2981 2018-12-20 19:16:55 Actually, I would prefer going to the gold standard,where the dollar is backup by precious metals, versus a printing press. 
 Libya's Gaddafi wanted to be paid in gold, for his oil. He died. 
 Ultimate Power Corrupts whether it's govt officials or banking industry. Audit the FED
2982 2018-12-20 19:16:30 Leading indicators are still strong, and I don’t see any big adverse shock (e.g., the doubling of oil prices that typically precedes a recession). I do think the Fed made a mistake, but I also think there’s time for them to realize that and fix it, and I think they will.
2983 2018-12-20 19:16:30 Search your soul very deeply and swore to this nation that you never awards oil blocks for sexual gratification##

2988 2018-12-20 19:15:44 Oil prices are down. I hope it remain record low for atleast next 5 years. It should be good for Pakistan.
2989 2018-12-20 19:15:43 Si no son Oil Stick, mejor no me medico-
2990 2018-12-20 19:15:43 You know the drill Flash.  Please note Patriots, controlling the global OIL market = power.
This has been happening,  the plan for years. We have watched global re-alignment while Trump burned our reputation & place at the table -the head of the table.
2991 2018-12-20 19:15:32 The Dow plunged below 23,000 today and the Nasdaq is flirting with a bear market. US oil prices plummeted more than 4% to the lowest level since August 2017. Oil is in free fall. Still winning Comrade 45? Vile, evil Putin puppet. Insignificant 
2992 2018-12-20 19:15:21 Haha yes, I've been using the olive oil for ages now, since Saturday.  My mum did use a syringe kit from Amazon on my left ear this evening though and a good amount of wax came out. I can hear better now as a result, thankfully.  xxxx
2993 2018-12-20 19:15:21 Finally getting an oil change #adulting
2994 2018-12-20 19:15:04 Welp no oil change smh try again tomorrow..just gotta get up early in the am smh
2995 2018-12-20 19:15:02 Excellent points—I agree. I can’t imagine “we” being the oil ind (e.g. when Shell decided to exit oilsands extraction they had no difficulty finding somebody to acquire their assets), but take your point re: ideological opposition to gov’t doing so & corresponding likelihood. 1/
2996 2018-12-20 19:14:48 I really don't think it is about investment. Anyone guiding US policy and strategy would be thinking about "US interests," but investment in poor unstable regions? Oil? is nit likely near the top of the list.

"Blocking Iran" and Russia and counterterrorusm are probably what they
2997 2018-12-20 19:14:47  Use lavender essential oil as perfume to get to get to .
2998 2018-12-20 19:14:45 In fact, ISIS militia is smuggling its oil into Turkey to get the necessary cash for their operations.
2999 2018-12-20 19:14:43 @walmarthelp Just got my oil changed.  Care to explain why the technicians at my Wal Mart jacked up my oil pan with the wrong plug?

3003 2018-12-20 19:14:27 Does she realize you need oil to build those cars? Plus between all the mining and unrecycleable rare earth metals they're not much, if any better for the environment. Maybe look at fuel cells instead. Someone is getting paid for all this BS
3004 2018-12-20 19:14:26 my oil is literally oozing out of me, i'm so horny for a hot piece of hummer ass

3006 2018-12-20 19:14:19 Guess he’s not very good at making his point clear. The oil industry he loves so much depends on the purchase of vehicles, so it’s also a little contradictory, then.
3007 2018-12-20 19:14:10 I propose starting a counter gofundme for archery towers and hot oil dispensers as upgrades on the wall.

I want my children to die honorably for their motherland fighting in the Middle-East for oil and power as is expected from a decent American
3026 2018-12-20 19:12:46 Oil and gas is the industry in question though.
3027 2018-12-20 19:12:30 Yeah. Codeine and Nurofen upset me but have enough food on stomach and manageable. And yeah tea tree oil doesn't taste nice. Brushed my teeth about 10 times but couldn't on the tooth I'd put it on

Further there has been nearly no coordination between them against Isis. It is dark day

3044 2018-12-20 19:11:36 เคๆๆๆๆๆ นอนแล้วมันจะดีขึ้นป่ะ
3045 2018-12-20 19:11:33 I mean also the devaluing of oil might have helped as well to bring them to the point of economic crisis. It's why I also mentioned market manipulation. Nationalizing oil wasn't a mistake but making that the lynch pin of your economy was.
3046 2018-12-20 19:11:33 Yeah expect the United States in almost entirely energy independent now  the US lost serious control in Iraq because the radical government was then able to control much of the oil within Iraq and the Middle East when they withdrew. This is no longer the case.

3058 2018-12-20 19:10:59 Gold is a bedrock to guarantee cash with. The Deep State much prefers the shifting sands of oil that they can manipulate in their favor and crash the market when they want to hedge their bets. Happened for 100 years, time to bankrupt the Deep State. All their money is in tech.

Do you like fresh produce year round? Need oil for that. You're a big Leafs fan, I see. Know what runs the ice plant at ACC?

3086 2018-12-20 19:09:45 Of course, anybody who has money invested would have some in oil and gas.  Doesn’t mean the world does not need to transition away. It will not happen overnight , but it will happen.  Oil and gas will never go away, but it’s consumption needs decrease.  For our kids’ sake.

3091 2018-12-20 19:09:29 How about progress on not ruining the environment? Carnival’s Arctic ships use cheap heavy fuel oil, exhaust from which speeds Arctic ice melting. As a company that relies on marketing the pristine Arctic, you should be doing everything to protect this region—not destroy it.
3092 2018-12-20 19:09:27 “People are really angry on Thursday” because you leave you leave the stream to finger yourself or oil your head every 2 minutes. Make us wait like an hour for the packs. Slightly funny at first but you were taking the piss

3097 2018-12-20 19:09:10 Can we agree that the hottest auto on Earth is an #ElectricVehicle and that is putting some pressure on the price of oil. #Model3
3098 2018-12-20 19:09:04 Russia, Japan and Brazil have multilateral agreements that are not denominated in USD. China is seeking to purchase oil in Yuan. Ray Dalio  - "US dollar's days as the dominant global reserve currency are numbered."

3101 2018-12-20 19:08:59 Russia is not there to conquer Syria but to support the Syrian Govt in its fight against foreign terrorists supported by NATO countries, Israel & the oil rich Gulf States. They have an interest to protect important strategic commerical ports in Syria.
3102 2018-12-20 19:08:58 not happening anywhere else .. Capitalists never built up any other industry than oil in Venezuela and that is why it is failing
3103 2018-12-20 19:08:55 With continued decent GDP growth, very low unemployment levels, wage growth running ahead of a very mild 2.2% inflation rate, strong corporate earnings and balance sheets, and declining oil prices, exactly what non-recession  are we fearing??
3104 2018-12-20 19:08:54 Modern day Snake Oil salesmen have it so easy, they don't even need to hire someone to demonstrate the Oil works in front of a crowd anymore, they just need a GoFundMe account.
3105 2018-12-20 19:08:53 If this train wreck of a presidency will teach us something, hopefully it will be to take ALL elections seriously, because knowing that someone capable of such a moronic statement is in the US CONGRESS frightens the crap out of me

3118 2018-12-20 19:07:49 Palm Oil is good for you!
3119 2018-12-20 19:07:47 Isn’t oil plunging right now as the rest of the economy shows significant slowdown?
3120 2018-12-20 19:07:40 I am up to date on the economies, yes they are diversified but each has an industry that provides the lions share to GDP.
Oil is the one for AB, look at BC's Mining, Manufacturing, Forestry, Tourism, Fisheries are 5 out of the top 10. Each can be viewed as destructive
3121 2018-12-20 19:07:39 Remember to not share overly spicy, fat ridden foods with individuals who have not eaten recently.

I love grits. I love pinto beans.  I love tomato & onion slices wrapped in red lead lettuce. Oh so delish with olive oil & black pepper.
3122 2018-12-20 19:07:34 Charlie, looks like DjT got the artist 2 b creative and painted this 1 to b a bit more flattering in that it resembles the likeness of thelate Edgar Kaufman (dept store king) who's oil painting hangs in his 'Falling Water' home in Bear Run, PA that Frank Lloyd Wright designed!
3123 2018-12-20 19:07:32 It's not really Canada, just Alberta. They're angry because at least 25% of their economy is the oil sands and that industry is in trouble. They can't get pipelines built, neither through other provinces nor through the US, and global oil prices are down 40% in the last 2-3 mths.
3124 2018-12-20 19:07:27 I've never seen one of those, but I do know menthol essential oil sticks are helpful :)

3127 2018-12-20 19:07:09 is the 'plunge protection' team out drinkin ??

this market selloff is completely overblown.

IF this was a flight to safety - gold and silver would be skyrocketing
but theyre not and oil is dropping .. this is all nonsense.

run it down - then buy the bottom ..
3128 2018-12-20 19:07:01 I guess you forgot about all that oil. You are lying about the reactions of Russia, Iran, and Syria, to cover your own ass, which takes a lot of coverage. I thought you said in your original message that ISIS had been defeated, so the trio should have no one to fight. Flip-Flop.
3129 2018-12-20 19:06:45 It's going to get worse. Hopefully the city and @AndrewKnack are budgeting for it since pedestrians are going to have to walk farther for the #ETS2020 changes and our province is dead set on oil over climate change.
3130 2018-12-20 19:06:16 What’s 1/2 product? And yes I honestly think not using the oil or ecostyler has made a significant difference in my hair
3131 2018-12-20 19:06:13 Every time I see ladies with top notch make up on I’m always so dazzled and jealous at what they can do.

3134 2018-12-20 19:05:58 I want MORE socialism, not less. Just for starters, how about nationalizing the banks and Big Pharma, and maybe the oil companies! too.
3135 2018-12-20 19:05:50 Yeah, and I don't want to be part of one of those power-hungry countries.  That's why I'm happy to hear mine might be disengaging from just such a situation.  Fear (possibly unfounded) of high oil prices does not justify military force IMHO.

3138 2018-12-20 19:05:44 The whole comment section have lost their damn minds.  They have no idea how much the oil and gas industry creates so many things that they want to just get rid of it...as they are typing their ignorant responses with a product made from oil!
3139 2018-12-20 19:05:36 None of those lands or oil is ours to control. It is illegal for us to be there, not to mention most everywhere else we’ve installed our imperialist selves.
3140 2018-12-20 19:05:32 But just think of all the oil painting portraits this will buy.
3141 2018-12-20 19:05:28 Nothing whatever to do with inflationary expectations, global slowdown or OPEC. Everything to do with opaque macro market manipulation and the end of an era of sell-side oil market domination. Curve changed because prepaid #DarkInventory was released into the market

3147 2018-12-20 19:05:04 Because #Alberta threatened to withhold oil sales to BC if we refused to have the pipeline cut through our forests, etc. We’re not having it.

3165 2018-12-20 19:03:06 I have. And I;ve seen the precipitous decline in both price and volume of oil produced since the days of $130 per barrel - the dream of Salmond.

So you've got less of it. it sells for less and its harder to get out.

Good luck,

3181 2018-12-20 19:01:55 During WW2, word got round that that olive oil from the chemist could be used for cooking, forcing Boots and Timothy Whites to require a prescription before they would sell it to you. Eventually, the government made it only available with "points" (special ration coupons).
3182 2018-12-20 19:01:53 Why CBD oil is Heling so many people! Our bodies were made for it! Did you know you had a system in your body that works hand in hand with Canabis? What tp try CDB oil risk free? Ask me how! <3

It doesn’t quote a single peer reviewed study.

3205 2018-12-20 19:00:03 Why is Norway not a similar hell hole?

Perhaps socialism isnt really Venezuela's problem at all?  Maybe an economy with a 90% dependence on oil couldn't move fast enough when oil prices tumbled.

Socialism is just a red herring, an easy catch all answer for a complex situation.
3206 2018-12-20 19:00:03 Why The Jesus Lizard got high and shot at an oil rig
3207 2018-12-20 18:59:53 It doesn’t take an expert to realize oil is finite and being almost entirely resource dependent is a disaster waiting to happen. What do financial advisors do to minimize risk? They diversify. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket as my grandpa used to say.
3208 2018-12-20 18:59:51 had no clue oil changes take two hours 
3209 2018-12-20 18:59:50 Yvette Cooper will set up minimum pricing for oil, once we have the international renewable grid set up.
3210 2018-12-20 18:59:46 Sadly there are people who are buying what the snake oil salesman is selling. You have alot of gullible people in your country sadly, mostly those who couldn't find the Middle East on a map.
3211 2018-12-20 18:59:42 But it would give millions of dollars to GOP in office that are paid & controlled by oil!
3212 2018-12-20 18:59:42 If it anit one gosh damn thing it’s another!!! Can we just have a smooth day at work for once  work in the oil field they said, it will be fun they said!!!!
3213 2018-12-20 18:59:33 they're in EFTA ,as we were before 1973, but EFTA aren't keen on us joining them now. Norway also have high  taxes and loads of oil, the proceeds from which they've been sensible with and built up a massive govt. surplus.
3214 2018-12-20 18:59:33 Idk if you’ve tried this before or not but coconut/olive oil are really good for removing makeup and aren’t supposed to make you break out

3217 2018-12-20 18:59:09 Russia has done marvelous developments in muslim states that remained part of USSR for 60+yrs. Excellent infrastructure was developed. Education was extremely good, oil/gas drilling, mining, etc was carried out to make ex-Soviet States to stand on their own legs.

3219 2018-12-20 18:59:05 Wall surrenders Rio Grande River (municipal water source for 1.4 million Americans), hundreds of oil and gas wells, homes, churches and businesses of thousands of Americans to Mexico side in Texas. It creates “Disposable” Americans. Defend REAL border, not #fakeborder

3221 2018-12-20 18:58:51 That's ovesimplification, ISIS wants fundamentalist Islamic authoritarianism over the mideast, a caliphate, including control of oil resources, not unlike evangelical christofascist obsession with establishing their authoritarian theocracy over the US.  otherwise u r right, Marco

This is clearly not the voting record of someone in the pocket of big oil & gas. He voted 20 times against oil/gas/fracking.

3230 2018-12-20 18:57:50 Yes.  It's well established the government have the authority break up trust.  This happened with Standard Oil, and the Bell Systems.  Trust artificially inflate prices, and reduce competition.
3231 2018-12-20 18:57:47 I mean with lower oil prices it will be expensive to finance another keave campaign!

3235 2018-12-20 18:57:36 No other energy industry has been proven to be as stable or as reliable as the oil and gas industry and until someone further improves one of them to the status of the industry Alberta and the rest of Canada relies on I’d say it’s best to keep oil and gas on top priority.

He's opened up the Alaskan waters/land for them, allowed them to drill and frac in our national parks, given away coastal drilling along east coast (except of course Florida -MaraLago) #Corrupt45

3246 2018-12-20 18:56:04 Why trust any of their research given their willingness to work with oil fueled authoritarian regimes?
3247 2018-12-20 18:56:03 Of course in the coming decades Alberta will see a decline in its oil industry and so will everywhere else but this is about now and the fact that 1000’s of albertans with children and families now are losing their jobs, money and hope to survive.

3250 2018-12-20 18:55:32 Thats better though. We are happily enjoyed (overly enjoyed) the benefits of oil. If we cant switch to clean source, we gonna suffer in the future, our kids cant survive breathing toxic air. Delhi is the example.. 
Reduce pollution or go green!
3251 2018-12-20 18:55:31 And yet we continue to import Saudi oil.
3252 2018-12-20 18:55:23 $92 Billion, eh? Wow. That's almost as bad as the $1.5 TRILLION the government has given their banker buddies since the 70's in compound interest payments on infrastructure loans. If we can keep paying private banks Billions in taxpayer money yearly, why not their oil buddies?

3259 2018-12-20 18:55:01 Very disappointing coming from   Stephens. Is he getting heat for dwindling readership and needed to be deliberately provocative? If so, whether you agree or not with Warren’s positions, to compare hers with those of a con artist selling snake oil was outrageous.
3260 2018-12-20 18:54:59 Ugh of course when I go to get an oil change they say I have other things wrong with my car. Smh  I hate being a female sometimes because idk whether or not to trust them

3290 2018-12-20 18:51:55 So oil price did not crash during GEJ time? Accept GMB failed the country and move on. No policy to drive the economy for 6 good months and u r talking about oil price.
3291 2018-12-20 18:51:50 It's a wild notion. But if the fed ever had the chance, it's perfect now. With oil fall and fed kinda dovish re future, if inflation does come in stronger, pressure will be off somewhat and mkt back up. I've been suggesting it for awhile but not normal fed bahviour.

3293 2018-12-20 18:51:36 when gas prices rose in 2008 due to high crude oil prices, the response was a sustained decline in national VMT and a consumer preference switch for more fuel efficient vehicles.

3295 2018-12-20 18:51:32 Its a regional high with live oil all around it. Earthquake = permeability. Its geology, not geophysics. I don't know what's downdip of Ghawar, but you can't keep producing 2bn barrels a year for decades without a reserve impact. I suspect decline will be steep once off plateau

3308 2018-12-20 18:50:20 It sounds like that to me. "autism has no right to exist" sounds like "autistics have no right to exist."

3314 2018-12-20 18:49:41 Why are they ending ? Because oil companies paid congress to set some asinine arbitrary limit. They can and should be extended, and will be extended and increased when Democrats take over congress and win the presidency in 2020. Deal with it.

The loans are for companies to move to away from oil.  Such BS. We need to get a control on foreign meddeling
3324 2018-12-20 18:48:47 And we have our own oil supply, we can foment an over-throw of the mullahs in Iran by their population, Saudi Arabia can utilize the GCC to keep everything from boiling over in the middle east and we can stop spilling our blood and treasure.

3332 2018-12-20 18:48:15 If Trump was with Russia, he wouldn’t be increasing our oil/gas production to the most in history, helping to cause the price of oil to plummet.  The price of oil going down means Russia can’t pay their bills.

3338 2018-12-20 18:47:43 Rate hikes alone don’t determine stock prices. Search the DOW from 1900 to present. This is normal market action. I make a living off this stuff. Look at my past tweets where I recommended selling crude oil futures as well as other tips. Trying to help all Patriots.

3347 2018-12-20 18:46:59 I can’t stand Trump but this is a correct decision. We don’t want to fund Saudis so they can access the Nabucco pipeline. They wanted access, Assad said no and we had a war. War for oil rights is stupid. Time for new technologies.
3348 2018-12-20 18:46:58 Love it, get the hot oil please.
3349 2018-12-20 18:46:54 Too my MELANIN Brothers out there, I have the perfect beard oil for US, it's a SPECIAL BLEND Beard Oil aided for our unique hair and hair growth!  Site deals
3350 2018-12-20 18:46:45 And it has to keep getting that oil at the end of a gun?  Is that forever?  Should we just call Syria the 51st state?  Or maybe 53rd after Afghanistan and Iraq?
3351 2018-12-20 18:46:43 @Lawrence If Pres Obrador would just pony up $25b everything would be solved. Short of cash? No ATM nearby? No problem.  He can just hand over any one of the Ku, Maloob, or Zaap fields to "Take the Oil" Trump.
3352 2018-12-20 18:46:40 Am confused,  what is the taste of engine oil?  Who drinks it?
3353 2018-12-20 18:46:36 البترول WTI وصل لأقل سعر عام ٢٠١٨ وسجل اليوم تقريبا ٤٥.٥$ والبرنت تقريبا ٥٤$ مين يصدق ان الأسعار تنخفض كدا وبالشتاء! لسة لما 
ال shale oil يدخل! المهم حظ بلدنا حلو حقيقيً
3354 2018-12-20 18:46:31 Will they have the oil pattern highlighted
3355 2018-12-20 18:46:30 Saudi Arabia's oil revenue is a maximum of $245bil per year. If Pakistan did produce 10% of that oil(which is very very hard even with known reserves, at 1mil barrel per day and will only sink oil prices further), that still gives the country near 5% fiscal deficit.

But Buhari is incompetent
3357 2018-12-20 18:46:18 We have less than 12 years before we reach the 1.5 degree warming mark. Climate change is already one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Stop thinking that the problem can be the solution. There’s no way we can save our future if oil and gas are still apart of it
3358 2018-12-20 18:46:15 I hate getting my oil changed because of the up-charges they try to pressure women into, but also because when they ask me to test my lights, I suddenly forget how to operate a vehicle.
3359 2018-12-20 18:46:02 War is not sustainable, corporate welfare is not sustainable, fracking is not sustainable, bursting oil pipelines leaking into the ocean is not sustainable and yet we put with all of it. Medicare for All actually costs less than the current system we live under, read on it.
3360 2018-12-20 18:46:00 Yes, nice of you to share your oil and electricity with us. Overall I like your country but you need to brace yourselves as the world literally heats up. The winter cold disappears and your country becomes increasingly valuable to others.
3361 2018-12-20 18:46:00 Port Arthur LNG, LLC, a subsidiary of Sempra Energy, and the Polish Oil & Gas Co. (PGNiG) entered into a definitive 20-yr sale-and-purchase agreement for LNG from the Port Arthur LNG liquefaction-export facility under development in Jefferson County, Texas.
3362 2018-12-20 18:45:58 There was zero oil except for what was in the food
3363 2018-12-20 18:45:51 Pam, no more troops in the Middle East, no more oil wars, no more Americans sent home in body bags.  Who would like this?, apparently not @acosta followers, because like you said it’s a stupid idea.
3364 2018-12-20 18:45:37 pasta, red, green, yellow peppers, red onion, 1 cup olive oil, 2 cups vinegar, garlic bread, sliced apples - feeds 4 - five bucks
3365 2018-12-20 18:45:31 grown ass man beside me talking about rubbing cbd oil on his dik
3366 2018-12-20 18:45:30 I think it’s a change in strategy because the main objective is to push Putin out of Syria they’re now using oil as a diplomatic tool. 

If I’m right Putin is going to go nuts create a major crisis or submit and leave too.
3367 2018-12-20 18:45:18 we've got the Oil and Gas .
Enjoy powering yer country on fresh air mate.
3368 2018-12-20 18:45:15 It’s political chess, a proxy war. Usual Middle East politics & religious BS.  Saudis vs Iran. US vs Russia (before tRump). Oil & gas. ISIS & humanitarian reasons way down in the list unfortunately.
3369 2018-12-20 18:45:13 2007 on FX desks felt a lot like US trade and c/a deficits blowing out and receivers of those USD (especially among oil exporters who weren't targeting manufacturing competitiveness in US markets) swapping them into EUR as fast as they got them.
3370 2018-12-20 18:45:10 Is that the dude who eats Olive oil instead of fruit?
3371 2018-12-20 18:45:05 But they’ll do much better once the Liberals kill the Oil industry.

3375 2018-12-20 18:44:34 I'll usually put a little coconut oil on my lips w my finger, dip that finger in sugar and rub it on my lips.
3376 2018-12-20 18:44:32 About to get a oil change so once they start im a just be on here tweeting away...
3377 2018-12-20 18:44:30 No worries.  Oil will crater with u or without u!
3378 2018-12-20 18:44:19 No tar sands like they have been called forever. Oh and buy the way I’m sure the yearly  $3 billion in subsidies to big oil  helps with their social conscience.
3379 2018-12-20 18:44:13 Snake oil salesman
3380 2018-12-20 18:44:05 I’ve never heard of that!! is it good? I use creme of nature, Camille rose, jojoba/castor/peppermint, tea tree oil and organic root products for my hair.. and I buy it in bulk everytime
3381 2018-12-20 18:43:57 Why isn’t anyone talking about the fact Trump Administration has cut off Terrorist funding in addition to defeating them on the ground? Terrorist no longer have the Oil Market to fall back on the USA is the largest exporter of oil. No cash for the terrorist
3382 2018-12-20 18:43:52 Postmedia is owned by an American hedge fund and the National Enquirer. They have a mandate to support the oil companies and are actively working to introduce US style Conservatism to Canada. This is propaganda, not news.
3383 2018-12-20 18:43:48 Down move on Nasdaq & S&P is eerily starting to look like oil chart. 
Very oversold but....
3384 2018-12-20 18:43:46 80% GDP is from drugs and that’s the Mexican economy without oil, which was nationalized , just as all socialist countries , viva Venezuela!
3385 2018-12-20 18:43:46 Bhai Pakistanion...agar hum aapka mein ek hote to shayad middle East oil ko manage kar rahe hote..na ki amrika sahib...but this preposterous level of hate for us is what makes our peaceful coexistence untenable..
3386 2018-12-20 18:43:29 Let’s see, your campaign ran on 2, three word chants: LOCK HER UP! and BUILD THE WALL!

Neither has come to pass. (Like smart people knew would happen) 

Now go slither away like the snake oil salesman you are. Ssssssssssssss...
3387 2018-12-20 18:43:29 Is it possible for a Jewish/ Christian society to live in peace with a Muslim society. Or is the 10 commandments & sharia law like water and oil ?
3388 2018-12-20 18:43:25 Can you tell me which car manufacturer recommends 20k before an oil change? Besides from #tesla

Боже мой эта картинка такая эстетичная
3391 2018-12-20 18:43:06 I keep screaming: No more oil pipelines. Turn them 90 degrees and send water west.

Biggest shock for a California girl moving to Iowa: No irrigation; big industry here’s getting water AWAY from the crops.
3392 2018-12-20 18:43:01 Well since the water heater project looks like a total bust I guess next thing imma do is refinish my kitchen cabinets. They’re really gross bc they have no knobs so they’re oil and dirt all over them and they don’t match anything in the house
3393 2018-12-20 18:42:59 In ELP’s Advisory Board we have a true diversity of mind, competency and energy sectors: agency, in house, management consultancies, electricity, oil and gas, petrochem, geology, networks, industry bodies etc. #PRChatAfrica
3394 2018-12-20 18:42:50 I eat pig intestine on the regular. Put it in there with some fish and chili oil and you've got a delicious Szechuan dish. @peta u not racist r u?
3395 2018-12-20 18:42:48 Just have to keep saying this but thank you for selling your oil stocks cheap so I can buy more.

3399 2018-12-20 18:42:25 Obama put us there. Next, ISIS is not gone! Next, we can’t prevent future terrorist build up with no presence. Next, the Russians will build bases once we leave! Russia will control the region and oil(your buddies)! Next the experts are warning you! Last, you expose Israel!
3400 2018-12-20 18:42:22 Tea tree oil >>>
3401 2018-12-20 18:42:16 Those are really interesting instructions. It worked with the canola oil though, so I might try it with my next pan. At the very least, it sounds way faster than the oven method.
3402 2018-12-20 18:42:05 Christmas light? Wow, that's wacky. In New Zealand we use tiny little lamps fueled by the oil of Maui's dolphin, which burns a festive green for male oil, and red for female oil
3403 2018-12-20 18:42:03 Also friendly reminder that renewable energy provides 6 times as many jobs as oil and gas so the whole “keep Canada working” stance is just a scare tactic so the oil companies can keep making money while knownly destroying the planet
3404 2018-12-20 18:42:00 Earthquake, tsunami, rising rates, trade war, slowing growth, crashing stocks, oil plunging, govt shutdown, invasion at the border, political turmoil... I can't find any bit of good news; where is it?  Must be a very bad alignment of the stars.  Let's hope it ends soon!
3405 2018-12-20 18:41:45 they takes me to get my oil change
3406 2018-12-20 18:41:43 I am currently fighting Stage IV lung cancer. Taking RSO oil and oral chemo. My 5x8 cm tumors have shrunk down to 2x1.8
3407 2018-12-20 18:41:40 Record production:  Yep we were about out.... NOT "crude prices have fallen 19% since breaking above $76 a barrel in early October, on worries over slowing demand for fuel and record production from major oil exporters."
3408 2018-12-20 18:41:39 She Cyah wull it she a ball out.......call the Orthopedist. @docweezy8.... she wasn’t readdddddddddddy... u buy Bbclt car...u know insurance, registration and fitness, plus, tire affi change, brake fuel, engine oil.....Bbclt
3409 2018-12-20 18:41:38 I hope this is olive oil
3410 2018-12-20 18:41:28 we are not the world’s keepers. for decades, america has intervened and deliberately destabilized most of the middle east for reasons purely oil/money driven.
3411 2018-12-20 18:41:21 1.Castor oil helps them grow and knocks out all the bacteria that stop your lashes from growing 
2. Drink Green tea 
3. Use a conditioning mascara 
4.dont rub or pull lashes
3412 2018-12-20 18:41:16 To topple countries on the other hand is likely to refuse a strategy it has used in the past to topple a(n OPEC) country, balkanizing the Borthern Oil rich region in the process, by partnering with Wahhanist fascists, and the outlets that have lied to you consistently about
3413 2018-12-20 18:41:12 O’Rourke voted for TPP fast track, crude oil exports, eliminating safety and enviro standards, offshore drilling, deregulation, etc.
3414 2018-12-20 18:41:11 How many Calgary voters would be for this support of pembina?  Would love to see poll numbers on it.  If majority of calgarians are anti oil, the province is lost.
3415 2018-12-20 18:41:08 This current administration has failed to grow the economy, reduce reliance on oil, provide security, create jobs & reduce untold hardship on the masses. Why then should we vote you @MBuhari @APCNigeria @OfficialPDPNig @renoomokri @fkeyamo @MobilePunch ???
3416 2018-12-20 18:41:06 The WISE took OIL in jars along with their lamps. They OIL their lives daily with God's Word while the foolish are taking it SELECTIVELY; taking only that which twinkles their ears. The WISE READ God's Word daily, meditate on it & obey ALL its principles. They strive to live holy
3417 2018-12-20 18:41:04 The U.S isn’t just fighting for oil though, plus the U.S still requires oil from the Middle East sustainably to keep oil prices from sky rocketing
3418 2018-12-20 18:41:00 Saturday's program: the convoy, the oil industry, the politicians.  Your verdict.
3419 2018-12-20 18:40:54 It could still be about oil. Control the oil, control where you want the oil bought: the US.
3420 2018-12-20 18:40:53 For each unit of oil transported on land a certain distance, what option produces the least CO2 emissions?
3421 2018-12-20 18:40:49 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Philadelphia sleeps.
3422 2018-12-20 18:40:49 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Dallas sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
3423 2018-12-20 18:40:47 Last Christmas special: 5 unframed oil paintings in one package. All are 250mm x  200mm. For the package of 5 paintings R1500 postage included. (Only in SA)
3424 2018-12-20 18:40:38 But then tricky Dick Cheney can't take their oil?
3425 2018-12-20 18:40:37 Protecting lol, destroying & murdering all round the world for oil.

3431 2018-12-20 18:40:20 Brian Jean, surveys now show Quebecers would love to have Canadian oil. You got hate mail from some kooks.....just delete them .

3435 2018-12-20 18:40:03 Why The Secular Bear Market In Oil Prices Remains
 
"The current levels of supply potentially create a longer-term issue for prices globally particularly in the face of weaker global demand due to demographics, energy efficiencies, and debt..."
3436 2018-12-20 18:40:03 3rd day with hives, oil burn on my face, working on 4 outs of sleep, and currently working. Can I go home and cry please

3438 2018-12-20 18:39:56 Awesome point from @business: no one in US #oil market saw crash coming..."Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas asked 166 oil& gas execs a simple q: what do you expect the WTI crude oil price to be at the end of 2018? >80% reckoned ...high $60s to low $70s range..lowest forecast  $55"
3439 2018-12-20 18:39:52 Cop the T-Gel for the wash and use coconut oil for the scalp  or Jamaican Castor Oil. Shit works lol. Mine do the same in the winter.
3440 2018-12-20 18:39:45 Good for those of us who are long gold, short oil, and short the SPY.
3441 2018-12-20 18:39:43 Omg. Why are we even dealing with this inhumane government? #oil
3442 2018-12-20 18:39:40 Goes in for a $49 oil change, gets told that car needs a transmission flush as it hasn't been done since I bought the car. New total $192 
3443 2018-12-20 18:39:32 Yes, snake oil heals all. History proves in many cultures it's works in all different forms.
3444 2018-12-20 18:39:27 Not too sure about the oil part since it hasn’t worked out for either side. But the power part is probably historic.
3445 2018-12-20 18:39:21 Huh? For not sacrificing money, war & lives for the love of oil, money & power.?
3446 2018-12-20 18:39:18 Hamonic has been pretty good this year. Him + Brodie seemed to be oil and water for some reason.
3447 2018-12-20 18:39:18 Removes sanctions from Russia, hands them Syria (along with their oil) and allows ISIS to regroup and rebuild.
3448 2018-12-20 18:39:17 The more Peter Obi speaks, the more the dearth of his intellectual ability becomes obvious. 
For example this statement: "If oil cannot save Venezuela, it won’t save Nigeria"
Socialism not Oil is the challenge with Venezuela, Oil has saved Saudi Arabia, etc. others just fine.
3449 2018-12-20 18:39:07 Oil prices are now indexes against Modi and not dollar anymore
3450 2018-12-20 18:38:35 For the Men

Cut your nails
Always wash your hands
Scrub your back
Wash your tongue 
Wash your buttocks and your balls
Wipe with tissue after peeing
Oil your body 
Use deodorant 
Change your briefs every morning 
Air your shoes
If you have hair (Wash with shampoo)
Spray perfume
3451 2018-12-20 18:38:09 Honestly I think it's just as simple as splitting AWS away from Amazon into a bunch of smaller regional subsidiaries, a la the AT&T splitup of the 80s or with Standard Oil even further back. Probably ditto for Google Cloud also I guess.
3452 2018-12-20 18:38:05 North Korean Oil Smugglers Elude U.S. Military, Top Secret Report
 
Another tactic employed by the North Koreans is using small boats to transfer oil from vessel to vessel.... harder to detect by the surveillance gear...
3453 2018-12-20 18:37:56 oil ya scalp n stfu
3454 2018-12-20 18:37:39 This oil change is taking forever. 
3455 2018-12-20 18:37:25 Fresh oil change ...nigga im bout to drive extra ignorant
3456 2018-12-20 18:37:23 Yeah! Like , the windshield and o2 sensor need to be replaced,  but theres an oil leak problem im hoping isnt gonna be a huge expense !
3457 2018-12-20 18:37:16 CL is crushing and  the Middle East Countries can Survive with $30 oil, but as long as US increase the output the Oil is going down.
3458 2018-12-20 18:36:55 Report for unlabeled political ad. Exxon/Oil companies have no shame about this.
3459 2018-12-20 18:36:53 If One Finger Brought Oil - Things Fall Apart part Biafra24
3460 2018-12-20 18:36:52 Nope to the mayo, olive oil preferably, and that’s the wrong bread.
3461 2018-12-20 18:36:47 Thought we are there meddling for 60 years because of the Middle East oil.
3462 2018-12-20 18:36:46 Ur pee sounds like French fries boiling in oil
3463 2018-12-20 18:36:46 The funding isn't coming in because C.A.R doesn't have oil, or any of those precious stones they want.
The shortage can never happen in countries like D.R.Congo though
3464 2018-12-20 18:36:45 Merry Christmas from Trump and the once GOP:
Dow sinks below 23,000; Nasdaq flirts with a bear market; Oil in free fall
3465 2018-12-20 18:36:43 “If oil cannot save Venezuela, it won’t save Nigeria”- @PeterObi .

He is telling us what our leaders should know, and why we shld be diversifying d Economy.Unfortunately diversification literally died with the last PDP govt and we can’t continue to depend on oil #AtikuMeetsCSOs
3466 2018-12-20 18:36:42 1/2 a trillion in oil patch clean up costs.
3467 2018-12-20 18:36:28 Does Edmonton REALLY support the oil and gas industry though? Last election it was a clean sweep of NDP elected in Edmonton. Tough to say for sure. I thought the protest and turnout was amazing! Great to see the oil industry finally stand up & have a voice. Just my two cents.
3468 2018-12-20 18:36:27 spf 15 + avocado oil = best tan of my life
3469 2018-12-20 18:36:27 Buhari owns no oil well. No castles. No private jets, no private university for children of the wealthy . He owns no estate in Nig, UK, US  or Dubai. No foreign account
Now madam tel me any Nigerian dead or alive who wil ve held such an office n wouldn't own a country of his now.
3470 2018-12-20 18:36:24 Yeah and this was my response:
Why because he knows that his support of Trump will now lead to the death of thousands of Kurds and allow Putin and Iran to control Syria and thus Putin will get his needed oil pathway? I hope you told him to fuck off with those crocodile tears.
3471 2018-12-20 18:36:12 It's like water & oil together.
3472 2018-12-20 18:36:05 California has reduced GHG emmissions year over year 2015-2017. And the economy is growing stronger than ever. The climate-deniers are funded by Oil&Gas interests afraid of their assets staying in the ground. Where they should be.
3473 2018-12-20 18:35:57 in oil 45.21 is the 2stdv.
3474 2018-12-20 18:35:55 Putin already got what Russia had wanted for centuries - a military base on the Mediterranean Sea. Now he can vie for some of Syria's vast oil reserves.
3475 2018-12-20 18:35:52 Stock market maybe falling ,silver lining is so big oil,under$2 for gas,working folks gets a needed Christmas present
3476 2018-12-20 18:35:44 This backroom deal sets no end date for the twin pipelines currently sitting in the open waters of the Great Lakes. The threat of an oil spill or natural gas…
3477 2018-12-20 18:35:43 Texas is committed to keeping the wealth in oil and gas and big corporations.  Our legislature doesn't give a shit about anyone who is not male, white, and wealthy.  They don't care about children either.
3478 2018-12-20 18:35:36 It does not have a future and, unlike Alberta and oil, it should be transitioning away from it now. Developing alternative industry before it collapses. Rather than the futile attempts to stop the future that its Premier is making.
3479 2018-12-20 18:35:33 Why because he knows that his support of Trump will now lead to the death of thousands of Kurds and allow Putin and Iran to control Syria and thus Putin will get his needed oil pathway? I hope you told him to fuck off with those crocodile tears.
3480 2018-12-20 18:35:33 Vegan and whole food plant based are not the same way of eating. That is important to note. I did whole food plant based, low glycemic index, no added oil or sugars. I eat low glycemic grains, fruit and veggies. I eat legumes and peas.

3482 2018-12-20 18:35:28 lol i stared at it for hours and it’s not even an oil painting like i think it’s etched in? or something dumb like that WACK
3483 2018-12-20 18:35:23 Merry Christmas from Trump and his GOP hounddogs: 
Dow sinks below 23,000; Nasdaq flirts with a bear market; Oil in free fall
3484 2018-12-20 18:35:17 The peppermint essential oil appears to reduce excess lactate - that which exceeds the body’s ability to clear under increased exercise intensity.
3485 2018-12-20 18:35:13 Oil extending earlier falls now down 5% at $45.90, Texan Shale producers suffering.
3486 2018-12-20 18:35:13 Getting oil changed on my car and I was told I have to go buy the oil and filter separately, the and then bring it back to them, but they have it on the shelf.. wot?
3487 2018-12-20 18:35:03 I know, but it shows that he can be done right in 3D. It's a different art style, but his proportions (hair, face, eyes), colours (freckles etc), as well as other things (like being covered in oil) are off and I can see why they're complaining 1/2
3488 2018-12-20 18:34:57 #RIP #WTI #oil =$40/bbl
$ES_F
3489 2018-12-20 18:34:50 I think my car is dead  the mechanic said there’s a leak in the engine and there’s coolant in the oil. why do I have the worst luck with cars???? I get regular oil changes, I get the best tires I TRY DAMN IT
3490 2018-12-20 18:34:49 $100 for a oil change geee I'm in the wrong profession lol
3491 2018-12-20 18:34:40 I’m glad I longed the dips on silver this week. Unfortunately the gains were completely offset by my attempts to long oil. 
3492 2018-12-20 18:34:29 Bear facts:  #Business Alert:  
Gold soar to 1265 per ounce - safe haven buying.
Silver at 14.77
Oil barely above 46.
Dow down by 400. TSX down 115. 

So how is Trump economics working out for you?
3493 2018-12-20 18:34:27 Dems & Obama slammed Beto-backed bills for aiding GOP tax agenda, chipping away at ACA, weakening Wall St regs, aiding oil/gas industry & bolstering Trump’s anti-immigrant policy

Beto is a Strong NOPE.
3494 2018-12-20 18:34:14 Crude oil from $75 to $46, this does not look like a normal behaviour.
3495 2018-12-20 18:34:14 Ok fine. Never mind that ISIS was extracting oil in Syria and selling it and transporting it under the noses of the “exceptional” US military for at least 2 years while US & Israeli airforces were bombing Syrian infrastructure to rubble. Until Russia intervened
3496 2018-12-20 18:34:04 This peppermint tea tree oil I have from Edwin body works is amazing
3497 2018-12-20 18:33:53 The market is fine oil is 40 to 60$ in the US THEIR pipelines are at full capacity ours are shut because we have a glut and no way of dispersing it and you use products made by oil and gas ALL THE TIME! Our oil is greener and cleaner !!
3498 2018-12-20 18:33:51 Yeah strategic because the Bush family was so tied to the Saudis. the middle East and the oil. We can finally drill our own oil and not pay money two people that hate us. And they hate us because we meddle in their affairs, prop up their dictators and are not Muslim.
3499 2018-12-20 18:33:46 You wanna talk timing? What’s up with betos timing? He’s voted in favor of fossil fuel industries at a time when fossils fuels are furthing human extinction. Sounds like a vote for Beto is pretty much a vote for big oil. How is that sticking it to trump exactly?
3500 2018-12-20 18:33:45 With two bats. Sure is signaling oil to 30's.
3501 2018-12-20 18:33:43 I'll answer you as an Italian! the sauce is prepared with boiled tomatoes and sieved with oil and basil and is semi-liquid(even the pesto is technically a sauce).the "sugo" is a totally liquid condiment (the difference lies in the consistency) that only serves to enrich the pasta
3502 2018-12-20 18:33:43 No the companies would not.  They want to get the best price for their product that they can get.  If they are publicly traded, they can be sued if they don't.  Oil companies have no loyalty to Canada whatsoever.
3503 2018-12-20 18:33:40 One of the oil paint ingredients has a very pleasant scent.. it's very vegetal, like, somewhere around watermelon rind or cucumber. I really like it. I'm almost certain it's not something g I should be huffing, but shrug emoji
3504 2018-12-20 18:33:27 Seriously? @realDonaldTrump  Trump tweeted a thank you to Saudi Arabia for current low oil prices,which he likens to Tax Cut for America & the World!' In fact, Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia.
Fake News... Lies
3505 2018-12-20 18:33:24 So China keeps Venezuelan oil
And Venezuela keeps the debt
Venezuela has worlds largest oil reserves
Chinese have the smartest diplomatic brains
3506 2018-12-20 18:33:23 Eric Theoret, Currency Strategist, discusses the oil price shock and our adjusted outlook for interest rates, commodities, and the Canadian dollar.
3507 2018-12-20 18:33:09 This Castor oil is taking forever to grow my patch back tf...I’m bouta go get some Wild Grow
3508 2018-12-20 18:33:07 While that has merit, the "transit" state has to agree to allow passage on "its" terms.
Given BC's intransigence, it would likely require an all out trade war to get passage of oil. 
However, BC's biggest export market is Alberta which would have significant leverage.

3510 2018-12-20 18:33:01 Interesting way to interpret several tweets, form your own false interpretation of what was said, then sneak in the phrase "snake oil". #ChronicDisease #HalfAdultPopulation #WereFineThanks
3511 2018-12-20 18:32:59 And you could only buy Olive Oil in Boots as a treatment for earwax. Nobody sold it as actual food *scoffs*
3512 2018-12-20 18:32:56 If the Kurds are going to survive the DOD needs to arm them with Stingers. If not then they can chose to align with another actor or wait to be exterminated. Turkey wants the ERV oil and gas. Anyone in Syria who thinks they will share it with the Alawai is a moron. @DefenseIntel

3514 2018-12-20 18:32:36 My mom acts like me changing her oil is some mechanic genius 
3515 2018-12-20 18:32:35 I love the of smell of gas, grease, and oil. It reminds me of my dad lol how weird
3516 2018-12-20 18:32:32 Let me get up so I can go get this oil change 
3517 2018-12-20 18:32:31 Engine oil R120
3518 2018-12-20 18:32:26 Man I hate going to get my oil changed. Go in for an oil change, leave with a bunch of quotes on things you needed fixed right away apparently.
3519 2018-12-20 18:32:25 Look like an oil painting.
3520 2018-12-20 18:32:19 ตลกชิบหาย จากเคยได้มองตัวจริงๆได้นอนกอดมันทุกคืน ถึงมันจะด่า และสะดีดสะดิ้ง ก็เถอะ ชอบแอบมาหอมเราตอนหลับด้วย 555555 ไม่น่าเชื่อวันนี้ได้นั่งมองแต่รูปภาพ 555555555 โมเม้นเชี้ยๆๆส่งท้ายปี
3521 2018-12-20 18:32:18 I believe in aliens but I wouldn't like to put money on it. As for santa-claus. Cmon do people really drink that snake oil 
3522 2018-12-20 18:32:14 Great move

Besides, didn't your President say that he could keep oil prices low by letting the Saudi prince kill whomever he wants ? 

So why do we need offshore drilling at all ?
3523 2018-12-20 18:32:12 Metal Silver News→  The US Shale Oil Industry Bloodbath Spreads As Oil Price Meltdown Continues: Santa isn’t bringing any gifts or even any…
3524 2018-12-20 18:32:02 Oil prodwill hit trumps imaginary wall!  Then in about 3 treats we will have massive crude shortage of Heavy Crude.
3525 2018-12-20 18:32:01 Sorry, I do not have the time to subtitle the video ... the basic idea of the speaker is simple ....... Iran never had enough Oil money to provide every one of its people a middle class life style ......... Iranians have to work and "produce" if they want to get out of poverty
3526 2018-12-20 18:31:57 Nice try. Can explain away his GOP leaning Trump agenda voting record next? Or were those hard working oil corp ppl too?
3527 2018-12-20 18:31:54 While it’s up there, how about a quick oil and filter change??
3528 2018-12-20 18:31:38 hehe YES
3529 2018-12-20 18:31:38 If you dig deeper you will see Alberta would mainly like to supply Canada and any additional exports would be used to provide revenue for the country. Even with export it still means more ethical oil is on the world market.
3530 2018-12-20 18:31:24 Plus, this is not even true. Almost all of the cars / trucks in that city are oil powered and most of what they buy (including food) has an important fossil fuel input.
3531 2018-12-20 18:31:15 #SaltFatAcidHeat Samin is everything, and I clearly need to invest in better olive oil

2. New geopolitics in West Asia/Middle east
3. Oil is losing its relative importance
4. For the first time a serious window is open for India to act as a global actor.

3537 2018-12-20 18:30:56 Too much oil and effort
3538 2018-12-20 18:30:52 Please send me settlement CBD oil; the sweetest CBD oil there is...
3539 2018-12-20 18:30:52 So, you’re going to kill oil sector jobs, tax the shit out of me and force me to buy a new car.  At least I will have a nice ride while I’m homeless and starving.  
3540 2018-12-20 18:30:36 B.C has a diversified economy.  Alberta actually has a much more diversified economy than the oil industry propaganda would lead you to believe as well.

3542 2018-12-20 18:30:27 No more oil I assume?
3543 2018-12-20 18:30:19 I thought it was interesting too. The instructions called for a third of a cup of oil, salt, and potato peels, sautéed on the stovetop but didn’t specify temperature—I’m sure it was too hot. Thanks for the info! I’m passing it along!
3544 2018-12-20 18:30:12 Nissan 300zx MOT failure. One owner from new car in need of a little help. Welding needed both sides and an oil leak from the sump. Decided to tackle the oil leak while waiting for the new panels to arrive. Opted to drop the subframe rather than engine out.
3545 2018-12-20 18:30:08 And the oil.
3546 2018-12-20 18:30:07 I’m sure there’s a flim flam man in there running the circus. Magats cant get enough of that snake oil
3547 2018-12-20 18:30:02 Lmfaoooooo word. I swear every time you get an oil change they wanna sell you that filter! Or wiper blades 
3548 2018-12-20 18:29:55 @oregonfootball averaged signing the 19th ranked recruiting class from 2014-18, & currently have the 5th ranked class.

Over that same span, @FSUFootball averaged signing the 5th ranked class in the nation. Currently they're 14th.

It sucks when people can smell your snake oil.
3549 2018-12-20 18:29:54 Keeping your hair in a ponytail is by far the best hairstyle to avoid breakouts. Your hair contains excess amounts of oil & dirt. Keeping it far away from your face at all times is crucial.
3550 2018-12-20 18:29:45 The environmental impact you refer to is a local environmental impact.  It really doesn't make any difference when it comes to global warming for instance. So, 'ethical oil' doesn't really make a difference in terms of anything global.  It's nice for marketing though.
3551 2018-12-20 18:29:40 How many more years Huckabee, should we stay in the Middle East??

16 is long enough.

We don't need their oil no more.

They need to fight & end their war themselves.

We haven't been fighting this war to win. GET OUT!!

3554 2018-12-20 18:29:38 Oh, remembered what I forgot to note last night:

My current preferred sealant for leather: 50/50 blend of beeswax and neatsfoot oil.

Melt the wax in a glass container in a double-boiler type arrangement. Add equal amount of oil. re-melt/stir; let harden.

3555 2018-12-20 18:29:37 The wise & the foolish are aware of Christ's return but are PREPARING differently. How? The FOOLISH ones took their lamps but did not take any OIL with them. Its like you want to be a Christian but you do not want to OBEY God & FOLLOW all His commands.
3556 2018-12-20 18:29:35 Likely if Hillary was President

We wouldn’t have a trade war with China

Fed would’ve raised twice in 2018

We wouldn’t have had tax cuts (increases actually)

More regulation

Equal/larger budget deficits 

Oil 60-65 (instead of 45-50)

& we’d be in or very close to recession
3557 2018-12-20 18:29:29 Hi friends! I’m looking for someone that can give me a quote on oil tank replacement and removal of the current tank? Thanks!
3558 2018-12-20 18:29:15 Exactly and I dont know about yours but my oil change already $80 like cmon fam. To hell with that filter

Now TV FFP stopped that
3560 2018-12-20 18:29:02 Oil also counts for only 10 % of Canada's GDP. And the amount of subsidization of the companies AND the fact that the majority of the oil companies are foreign owned never seem to come up with your points....
3561 2018-12-20 18:28:59 Fionna's cooking tips! A rind of parmesan should never be wasted! Toss it it in to a sauce to add some flavor(remove before eating like bay leaf!) Boil several to get an AMAZING broth you can use in soups, or just fry it in some olive oil to make parmesan infused oil!
3562 2018-12-20 18:28:58 If the Fed Govt presented a budget of N8.83tn predicated on $50 per barrel of oil, and an agency of the same govt can generate over N5tn. Pedestrian question is; why borrow to fund the budget? More importantly, why depend solely on oil? And, what about other govt agencies?
3563 2018-12-20 18:28:58 My view from the hotel is a tool shed and small oil rig. Get me out of kansas.
3564 2018-12-20 18:28:54 Never said there wasn't a demand or that we shouldn't be using Canadian oil. Clearly it's because it's cheaper to get that oil to the East than what we have right now. But why don't you go shut down an intersection in Ft. McMurray to really stick it to the anti oil ppl.
3565 2018-12-20 18:28:54 things are never going to change until the oil execs and their families suffer consequences for what they've done.
3566 2018-12-20 18:28:53 "OIL CITY" Ya gotta love the smell of diesel in the morning! Crude soup has to be seriously cooked at boiling temperatures to make high octane products.

3567 2018-12-20 18:28:45 Disgusted to find a local Dutch supermarket sells bread containing palm oil
3568 2018-12-20 18:28:44 Venezuela’s economy was based on their oil wealth. When oil prices fell, the country imploded. That’s putting all your eggs in one basket. 

The state running everything isn’t putting all your eggs in one basket it’s have the state manage lots of baskets. Unless a government 1/x
3569 2018-12-20 18:28:41 So Brent Crude Oil is currently trading at US$54.87...Today's price range has been between US$54.55 to US$56.74.
3570 2018-12-20 18:28:40 I have not. What type of changes can I make? I am going to look into some CBD oil pills right away. At this point, I am willing to try anything that will help.
3571 2018-12-20 18:28:37 I stopped using oil in my hair because it blocks moisture from getting into my hair. I spritz my hair with leave in and water everyday to keep it moisturized
3572 2018-12-20 18:28:37 And how much of the revenue from those 100,000 barrels of Chad's daily oil production were deposited in favour of the French treasury at the Banque de France in accordance with the CFA rules bequeathed by France to its colonies?
3573 2018-12-20 18:28:34 What's different this time is the oil glut in US because of unfettered fracking & how quickly tech & AI is replacing oil patch jobs. OPEC big influence on price of oil although international companies here play in OPEC too. Russia was invited to last OPEC meeting. Qatar leaving.
3574 2018-12-20 18:28:26 Why don't you start by explaining just how much money you, with your Deep State cronies, will be losing when the President pulls out of Syria and curtails the transfer of oil from Iraq to Turkey?

3578 2018-12-20 18:28:19 All the strippers I know smell like Victoria secret, not baby oil lol
3579 2018-12-20 18:28:17 It would be very profitable at current Canadian crude prices, that’s for sure. But, will require an upfront investment. If they do it, we won’t need to rely on foreign crude and won’t depend on US to buy our oil!
3580 2018-12-20 18:28:13 It fascinates me that even in Alberta our people are ignorant to their own reliance on our oil industry! It literally is the reason you are able to survive in this climate! We need to support our industry, our province and our oil workers!  #albertaoil #albertaproud

3584 2018-12-20 18:27:27 It's supposed to be extra healthy because it doesn't have any oil, lol
3585 2018-12-20 18:27:25 Why mouth such a phrase? I’m not too bothered tbh. The pattern of abuse is undeniable. There’s a clip out there of Cameron and entire Parliament howling with derision when SNP bring up devolution of oil that says everything
3586 2018-12-20 18:27:17 We need to cut out the poorbashing and look at the real parasites: the Koch bors for example who received millions in subsidies to protect their oil business from the possible loss of profit that comes with opening new drilling areas.
3587 2018-12-20 18:27:13 yeah, it's like Oil as well. Commodity shit is sooo difficult

3593 2018-12-20 18:26:46 Your counter arguments are tiresome. The market right now is glutted. We need to look to setting a world standard in creating greener technology, and NOT relying on oil. And there is a huge concern for the coastlines that most folks in the O&G sector seem to never consider.
3594 2018-12-20 18:26:42 Putin, bin Salman and Trump are now at the helm of the world's oil supply !! They are trying to crush OPEC and then rake in billions when they set "their" price for a barrel of oil !!
3595 2018-12-20 18:26:42 Agreed. A lot of Albertans struggled through the down turn, myself included. We did what we had to do to feed our families.  I'm not sure where these folks (I'm sure it's not all oil workers) get the idea they should be paid not to work. Ironically, most identify as right wing.
3596 2018-12-20 18:26:20 ありがとうございます直りました！！！！、！！
3597 2018-12-20 18:26:16 100% of Canadian oil should be supplied and refined by Canada, then export. Same for many commodities.
3598 2018-12-20 18:26:10 Manners dictate in Alberta we reference oil sands and charge the Canadian economy with production. At the same time credit CO2 collection by pristine natural and farmed lands.
3599 2018-12-20 18:26:01 The dumbest shit I’ve heard today are people doing harder drugs bc the gov is taking or limiting pain killers... why not, ya know try weed or CBD oil..? Why go to the extent of doing/getting heroin to kill your pain? Like do they not see who stupid they look?
3600 2018-12-20 18:25:58 I'm not sure what your point is. The whole story changed with the Iran waivers as everyone knows.    I was stopped out of energy quite a while back.  

What's your 1 year call on oil from right here? Rates? 

 Put a call out then.

3608 2018-12-20 18:25:30 (CNN Business)Fear of an economic slowdown is rocking Wall Street and the oil markets. The Dow briefly plunged below 23,000 on Thursday and the Nasdaq is flirting with a bear market.

Who calls this "winning?"
3609 2018-12-20 18:25:30 Won’t Saudis sell us oil regardless?  Being in Iraq isn’t good
3610 2018-12-20 18:25:24 He used oil to pay for his socialist policies. Free college, free health care, free housing, jobs guarantees, and so on. AOC is using the veil of green energy to cover up her desire for socialism.
3611 2018-12-20 18:25:23 Getting fair market value for products is NOT entitlement.  It is good business.  I assure you if Alberta had withheld transfer payments equal to what the cost differential cost Alberta oil we would not have this fight now.  The rest of Canada needs to understand fair pay.

3615 2018-12-20 18:25:11 En passant ehh, please if miss anonymous is reading this, can she DM anonymously? This one needs 5L of an outing oil and its in the office...

On a serious note, when you really need help say it. You can't wanna move on and you're still clinging 2 way u runx from 
3616 2018-12-20 18:25:10 People have been buying Snake Oil for years. This is just the latest version.
3617 2018-12-20 18:25:09 I can't look at this with out thinking its motor oil. 
3618 2018-12-20 18:24:43 Pipelines will not save Alberta when oil prices are $40/ barrel.  Losing $70 a barrel on Alberta tar sands oil, is not going to attract many producers. Time to get Alberta off the oil gravy train. They laughed at all the other provinces paying taxes but did not save for rainy day
3619 2018-12-20 18:24:31 A gofundme has raised several million dollars to help "build" the "wall". There is also a rival gofundme raising money to purchase and/or make ladders to scale the wall with. Trump supporters respond with a gofundme for boiling pots of oil. Opponents gofundme some trebuchets...
3620 2018-12-20 18:24:18 “Break out the baby oil. Left foot on green circle. Hey!!!!! Don’t touch me like that”
3621 2018-12-20 18:24:05 I think Opec wants to cut output now though.
If Nigeria was a sensible country oil going down would have been a good thing
3622 2018-12-20 18:24:05 Get to know Rep. Beto O'Rourke (D-TX):

- Opposes Medicare for all (HR 676)
- Opposes college for all (HR 1880)
- Opposes taxing Wall St. transactions (HR 1144)
- 2nd largest recipient of Oil & Gas money (2018)
- Voted 3x to increase Trump's military budget (HR 2810, 5515 & 6157)

3624 2018-12-20 18:23:49 Brilliant!
Also, best to avoid 'sustainable' palm oil too. There is no such thing. Sumatra 95% de forested for palm plantations, then claim its sustainable years later because they make small tokenistic gestures, like donating to orangutan rescue centres. 
3625 2018-12-20 18:23:36 I could go on about the worst types of people on Facebook but let’s go ahead  and establish that the absolute epitome of Facebook idiocy are the essential oil moms

3628 2018-12-20 18:23:28 Maybe she's down for the oil? She basically said you smell like a stripper. Have you ever seen women around strippers??
3629 2018-12-20 18:23:25 Were the oil companies owned privately? I really don’t know off hand. All the eggs in a basket illustrates the problem with socialism, though.

3632 2018-12-20 18:23:12 An African-American friend of mine moved from New Orleans to Toronto to work for Imperial Oil.  Great position, but ended not lasting long because he felt out of place from a cultural perspective.  He ended up back in the states in NOLA and Houston.

3635 2018-12-20 18:22:56 Beto O’Rourke? 

More like Beaten Oil Dork, amirite?!?
3636 2018-12-20 18:22:56 I dunno. The US seems more like a rusty oil tanker loaded with pirates, hostages, and toxic waste.
3637 2018-12-20 18:22:51 Please stop this nonsense of saying PMJT imports oil. Do you imagine the PM sitting at his computer ordering up shiploads of oil? OK, so Canada’s largest refinery is privately owned by the Irving family in New Brunswick. They can import from anywhere they choose.
3638 2018-12-20 18:22:41 Oil headed to $40. Cheap money over extended period ALWAYS leads to malinvestments. Interest burdens rising and sales falling at the same time, never bodes well for the bottomline
3639 2018-12-20 18:22:38 *It's very dirty. Ben himself is convered in grease and motor oil and the like.* Oh, hey, babe.

3645 2018-12-20 18:22:04 Got a $15 reward from Pep Boys. I can afford an oil change now!
3646 2018-12-20 18:22:00 A #JustTransition to renewable energy, a circular economy & sustainable society has the support of economists the world over. The fantasy is that Big Oil is going to save Alberta from the downfall of Big Oil. #abpoli #cdnpoli
3647 2018-12-20 18:21:55 Only if you believe it to be. The squeaky wheel gets the oil. They constantly complain therefore get the attention. Be proud to be a conservative stand your ground.
3648 2018-12-20 18:21:38 More likely weakening an enemy of Israel than for oil.
3649 2018-12-20 18:21:34 DIT Guyana accompanied 10 Guyanese Oil and Gas companies/officials on a trade mission to Aberdeen last week, building links between Guyana and the UK. Guyana is estimated to produce 120,000 barrels of oil per day (bopd) in 2020 #BusinessIsGreat
3650 2018-12-20 18:21:31 More snake oil please.

3653 2018-12-20 18:21:02 Our common basis for existence is oil revenue sharing
3654 2018-12-20 18:20:53 And yet what you want is pipelines not mostly to transport oil to other provinces, but for export. The reality does not match what you claim here.

3659 2018-12-20 18:20:27 They're not - pumps for wells deeper than 10m push the water/oil/etc up, not pull it (or they could pull it in a bunch of short stages, but that's usually more complex mechanically.)
3660 2018-12-20 18:20:07 @SurvivingGrady between some of the closing options available, who would you take?

I’m hot to trot for Zach Britton, mostly because he’s pitched in the AL East before. I’m thinking Adam Ottavino is snake oil. Don’t ask why, it’s just a gut feeling.
3661 2018-12-20 18:19:58 sana oil
3662 2018-12-20 18:19:57 I agree, and common sense dictates AB needs a sales tax to address deficit and stop waiting for another oil boom... 

if so called “socialist NDP government” won’t implement a sales tax how far do we have to “left” in AB to get one?  #ableg

3664 2018-12-20 18:19:43 Different skill sets involved in the oil industry. Oil sands is mined, not drilled. Reclamation could be started today,1000s of dirty orphan well sites in AB. I get the oil industry & markets are complex with many moving parts & many decisions made are out of our control.
3665 2018-12-20 18:19:42 "I like how the oil lasted for 8 days instead of 1. Now I know why they celebrate for 8 days and light 8 candles." #CelebrateWithDE
3666 2018-12-20 18:19:29 Nothing stops the USA from buying oil directly from Kurdistan & selling them weapons. Hell, nothing stops us from giving them SOTA weapons directly just as we gave $ billions worth of them to the Shiite Iraqi Central Government.

3669 2018-12-20 18:19:15 NO if you read Steele Dossier - Russia privatized a percentage of Rosneft their state owned oil company and gave Trump a percentage of Rosneft as payment for winning Presidency.

3679 2018-12-20 18:18:28 What does 'Canada oil is very ethical' even mean?  It sounds like another meaningless talking point.
3680 2018-12-20 18:18:20 Not only will it prove destructive to the environment, kill/harm many species of marine life, it will be detrimental to  commercial fisheries. So many jobs will be lost. All for oil! Why can this admin not look at job creation in renewable energy?

3684 2018-12-20 18:18:14 @ddailyreport . Booing the president is obviously not in the interest of the populace , probably the president did not oil the machinery of corruption in the hallowed chamber. The display of lack decorum in the house of assembly is an  exhibition of political rascality
3685 2018-12-20 18:18:13 The sanctions have nothing to do with the crisis, a barely competent analysis of maduro's economic policies will lead you to the only conclusion that the crisis is their fault. An example of that is the destruction of the nationalized oil production that they and only they manage
3686 2018-12-20 18:17:49 Speaking of, gaining access to Iranian oil happened by your country and Britain overthrowing a democratically elected government in Iran and installed a dictator because that government was going to nationalise their oil.
3687 2018-12-20 18:17:46 If we import more then pricing for everything goes up which hurts the poor and fixed incomes the most.
I'm not pro oil I'm pro Canadian people

3691 2018-12-20 18:17:13 He let sardine oil Baptise him. He is a new unwanted being lol
3692 2018-12-20 18:17:12 Eliminate: 
1.  Dept. of Education, state and local issue.
2.  Dept. of Energy, no longer dependent on foreign oil.
3.  Dept. of Veteran Affairs, it’s a failure.  Put $ in HSAs for Veterans.
4.  Dept. of Housing and Urban Development, let states take care of their own people.
3693 2018-12-20 18:17:10 Agree. But our oil needs to get to the coast regardless of the price. & the most sensible way to do that is by pipeline

3695 2018-12-20 18:16:54 Absolutely! See also: cooking bacon or eating salad w/ oil & vinear type dressing. Every. Single. Time. (protip: if you get after it fast enough with some Dawn, can usually prevent staining).
3696 2018-12-20 18:16:53 Udah pake baby oil padahal:( tetep aja tangan ga mendukung
3697 2018-12-20 18:16:50 State capitalism is a thing. And the US government is owned by oil barrons like the Koch brothers.
3698 2018-12-20 18:16:48 The oil production forecast is laughable

3. Take a daily thank you walk. Practice gratitude. 
4. Pray, meditate. 
5. Help others-Mother Teresa effect
3700 2018-12-20 18:16:40 The sad part is they don’t have the extra cash. People who can’t afford to are chipping in for the wall because they don’t want to admit what they all now realize: they’ve been conned by a snake oil salesman.

3703 2018-12-20 18:16:34 That oil change and tune up have the car feeling like a brand new bitch
3704 2018-12-20 18:16:33 This is how I view it. 7 out of 10 top oil producing countries are unethical. Canada oil is very ethical, if we stop production that extra oil needed will be produced by an unethical country which is worse for the climate.
Oil is not going away soon.
3705 2018-12-20 18:16:20 So do our Oil Industry workers. Clearly, you are not committed to working with them.  You just want to pay welfare.
3706 2018-12-20 18:16:13 100% agree that there needs to be more support by the government in retraining people in renewable energy. But the need to get our oil to the coast can not be ignored

3717 2018-12-20 18:15:44 Perhaps the threat of pulling troops out of Syria is an attempt to drive oil prices up. Nothing drives up prices for oil like instability in the Middle East. The money grubbers, who trade in oil but never touched it always blame price increases on instability and uncertainty.
3718 2018-12-20 18:15:36 I am not amazed,it proceeds from ferlizer racketeering, this is just like saying the oil marketer donated billions of naira to the same, it is the proceeds dt come from d oil subsidy that we were told doesn't exist when APC was in opposition, now it exists
3719 2018-12-20 18:15:27 We are the largest oil producer in the world.
3720 2018-12-20 18:15:18 I’ve done 23,504 miles in 4 months, cheers car for never breaking down on me even when I forget to check your oil
3721 2018-12-20 18:15:16 I know it’s strange to you for someone to provide sources for data, or even to provide any real data at all, but that’s what I’ll keep doing.

And a bottle of imported Cretan olive oil.

I love my job 
3728 2018-12-20 18:14:29 All I'm pointing out is that if you want to move this oil via pipeline
1.stop lying about the reality of global warming
2.respect that people in the rest of Canada have legitimate concerns over bitumen
3.stop being unquestioning enablers of your oil and pipeline companies.

3733 2018-12-20 18:13:46 government including (ONGC, HPCL, BPCL, Indian oil) and these bodies have collected 146 cr till now that comes under the CSR corporate social responsibility which ensures that the company takes out certain amount from the earnings and use that amount in social work.
3734 2018-12-20 18:13:38 Don’t take my tweets the wrong way either. I support the convoy/protest. Things need to change. But imo it was carried out in a poor way. I do wonder if we had 100$/barrel if there were teachers and Nurses doing this... if the oil workers would express the same support??

3736 2018-12-20 18:13:32 Lots of bogus narratives in written by people w/ MBAs w/ zero experience in oil & gas business, zero understanding of oil & gas history or history in general. Like trusting a genius w/ degree in finance who read a lot about medicine last few yrs to be your doctor. Suerte!
3737 2018-12-20 18:13:25 Yes - unless they have oil & we need it.

3740 2018-12-20 18:13:21 They believe hurting others helps themselves, no matter how vulnerable the others are. If they believed oil companies were vulnerable, they would not be deniers.
3741 2018-12-20 18:13:19 Hey @jkenney - are all the #Alberta oil companies 100% Canada-owned? 

Oops
3742 2018-12-20 18:13:19 It’s a possibility OR could also not be oil and be something safe on the Duck ..never really know but watching it you’re like wtf lol

3745 2018-12-20 18:13:10 I never said once that I was against the pipeline. My industry actually relies on construction entrepreneurs, but at some point you balance the future and the current systems. With Oil being as low as it is, it is time to start investing in other areas of or resources.
3746 2018-12-20 18:13:08 I saw that on the floor the other day but I thought it was on oil spill - I didn’t see the hands on the walls LoL!! Omg  wtf happened there? Is PubG subtly creating a backstory that explains the desolate wasteland we’re all playing in?? 
3747 2018-12-20 18:13:06 Thank you for this @ericnuttall I always look forward to your write-ups so knowledgeable and full of insight Thank you again Eric when you feel like your the only one holding on to oil and loosing hope articles like this realy help and remind yourself why your in it forthelongrun

larry just made us buffalo chicken pizza AND deep fried pb & j AND hot tomato oil with rolls 
3749 2018-12-20 18:12:47 This country is larger than Alberta so as usually conservatives worry about the large provinces. And the hell with the smaller provinces. For conservatives to win they better come up with some policies not just fear and take on oil industries. That is how they lost 2015
3750 2018-12-20 18:12:40 There will always be those gaming the system (Not SEO’s fault but businesses looking for an edge) but the mass snake oil tarnish will vanish finally I think.

3752 2018-12-20 18:12:28 Still pushing the “no jobs” bs huh? If there are no jobs how in the Christ did AB oil companies profit $50 billion? NEWSFLASH...again, this vicious cycle has been perpetual in the oil patch since it began decades ago, I suppose if you actually lived in #Canada you’d know this.
3753 2018-12-20 18:12:21 Kinda rude for my car to need an oil change when I’m this broke but okay
3754 2018-12-20 18:12:21 To soften your hands, rub your hands with warm olive oil, leave it on for 5-7 minutes, and rinse off with warm water.

3757 2018-12-20 18:12:10 The Gas Pocket is very dangerous to the miners, oil & water drillers & TBM operators. Before or during the drilling, boring & mining the company should use 3D Seismic Technology to identify the gas pockets especially in coal mine. You must know what in front of you before mining
3758 2018-12-20 18:12:08 Phase out coal, oil, whilst building windmills and sol AR panels which will create jobs for everyone and everyone will become prosperous and we will all live happily ever after.
3759 2018-12-20 18:12:06 Remember Trump said he would have taken the oil when Bush invaded Iraq?
3760 2018-12-20 18:12:00 Essential oils? You have to dilute them with a carrier oil like almond oil.
3761 2018-12-20 18:11:47 If they 'shifted production' out of the oil sands entirely, that contradicts your argument that they had to maintain production based on contracts or to maintain market share.  Either they shifted production out of Alberta or they didn't.  You can't have it both ways.
3762 2018-12-20 18:11:38 Yeah, but bullshit from Cortez day in and day out is NOT an idea, it’s snake oil from a used car salesman.

3766 2018-12-20 18:11:25 Brian Jean, ever Alberta's statesman, descends to new depths to pour fuel on oil patch entitlement.
3767 2018-12-20 18:11:24 No it won’t. We do not transport oil by truck to tidewater.  The forced production cuts due to our inability to get our oil products to market is what is eliminating jobs
3768 2018-12-20 18:11:21 SO good! And the cinematography was like an oil painting, frame after frame! Everything was pretty much perfect about that film!
3769 2018-12-20 18:11:20 Your message was clearly paid for by faceless oil and gas profiteers and as logical as saying desalination is an easy fix.
3770 2018-12-20 18:11:00 Car washes, cleaning it out, tries, oil changes, gas, getting it fix all that shit . Because I’m not doing it lol
3771 2018-12-20 18:10:51 Maybe @ReaganBattalion sees no different between a direct attack on Pearl Harbor and the fights in the Middle East that have only traded on failed dictator for another all to keep the flow of oil coming
3772 2018-12-20 18:10:49 Hope your not a Tory voting Liverpool supporter, as everybody knows that’s like trying to mix oil and water
3773 2018-12-20 18:10:48 Oil prices tumbled nearly 8 percent on Tuesday, hitting new lows for 2018, with WTI down 40% from high near $80 in October 2018.

3775 2018-12-20 18:10:42 Y'all see what's going on with Oil rn? The markets is gonna be morbid in '19.
3776 2018-12-20 18:10:29 Bless you both. I tried castor oil years ago with my son and all I got was the  it was disgusting they use say drink it in lime as you couldn't taste it then. It just floated on the top. 
3777 2018-12-20 18:10:23 ZERO NRA money. None. Just like Beto is being scrutinized for oil/gas money and everyone is pointing out the individual donations? ALL of Sanders donations, totaling $11k in 2016, came from hunting clubs in his state. If you lie about these things when Google exists, you're shit.

3781 2018-12-20 18:09:56 Exactly, Now there's enough Oil secured elsewhere, Let the  Muslims kill each other.
3782 2018-12-20 18:09:49 That you're linking to an article about desalination in a discussion about use of water in the oil sands makes very clear that you don't have the first clue what you are talking about.
3783 2018-12-20 18:09:39 And yet, as I've already mentioned, oil production (extraction) has not declined in the oil sands.
3784 2018-12-20 18:09:38 No, just slice it, heat up a pan with olive oil, put it in and fry both sides. Once it takes some colour it’s good. Top with some good kosher salt.

3789 2018-12-20 18:09:07 NYC Friday to see 61 F high temperature. No lows colder than 31 F through Jan 3. So no demand surge likely from heating fuel in U.S. Northeast. But that ratio will be in play soon enough. Happy holidays and safe travel. #oil #weather #winter

3792 2018-12-20 18:08:38 filled my car with diesel today @ 133p litre

oil has fallen by 35%+ in 2 months 
duty of 57.95p per litre 
before vat is added the retailers are selling at least 10p above correct price 

why gov allowing price fixing?
@PhilipHammondUK 

is this for vat revenue?
3793 2018-12-20 18:08:33 Who gets their car detailed at an express oil change? You do understand the point of these things right?
3794 2018-12-20 18:08:30 y'all almost found oil
3795 2018-12-20 18:08:20 OH and since Carefresh is pure paper it doesn't have the oil found in cedar and pine bedding that can be bad for them too.

3799 2018-12-20 18:08:03 The Pentagon also were looking to secure oil assets nearby namely the Conoco fields (highly profitable field) so as a result instead of finishing off IS and their reamining few fighters, they stopped and cited their miniscule presence as a pretext to ilegally occupy Syria
3800 2018-12-20 18:07:32 Nigeria needs a President who believes that Education is our New Oil and Human Capital Development our new economy...
3801 2018-12-20 18:07:31 This thread is super informative! I had no clue about this process/set up in MN. Hoping that it continues to work out! Side note on CBD: I get my CBD oil from the wedge (no prescription) and have been using it for 8 months. Love it beyond all belief and wish I had used it sooner
3802 2018-12-20 18:07:24 I've actually been thinking about this lately. If we got off oil the middle east would have less power and we would have less of an incentive to be in those wars because most of them are being waged for resources.
3803 2018-12-20 18:07:15 What in the hell are you talking about? The Athabasca/Mackenzie system is at no threat of being exhausted from oil sands producers and a tiny fraction of Canadians rely on it for drinking water. There is no connection between oil sands' water use and consumer prices.
3804 2018-12-20 18:07:02 Drop in #CrudeOil prices, U.S. #Fed stance help #Currency to strengthen

Rising oil prices in the earlier part of the year caused the currency account deficit (CAD)  to widen, as #rupee #depreciated about 15% during the January-October period.
3805 2018-12-20 18:06:51 You shine because you still use that African oil from the beauty supply.
3806 2018-12-20 18:06:34 If you use gasoline you use oil. We can get it domestically or we have to get it internationally. Maryland citizens should get to vote on issues like this. I support the President’s energy initiatives and I am letting my congressional representatives know.
3807 2018-12-20 18:06:26 And what about Trump pulling out of Syria so that Putin can get his oil pipeline more easily.  Yeah, Putin was a very happy camper today about Trump and he let the whole world know too.  And Trump endangering America to ISIS so as to appease Russia means that's TREASON!
3808 2018-12-20 18:06:13 Oil has gone down to $45.67, I will wait for it to $12.34. I don’t believe the price can be $0.12.
3809 2018-12-20 18:06:13 Why just Syria?  And why aren't you 'taking the oil' as you repeatedly stupidly claimed Obama should have done...

3812 2018-12-20 18:06:04 Just because you support oil and gas doesn't make you a conservative. 

It does however make you a Trudeau hater.

3815 2018-12-20 18:05:39 I swear i just gotta oil change ! Now i gotta get another one 
3816 2018-12-20 18:05:31 The TMX was stopped by enormous amounts of money paid by a couple of big US oil companies, to faux environmental groups. They clever tripped the govt. plan. Now they can keep getting our product super cheaply.

3818 2018-12-20 18:05:16 The greatest game the oil producing provinces have *EVER* played is hiding their #emissions of 60 tonnes per person, inside a Canadian average of 20 tonnes per person, and then telling us it’s not worth fixing cuz we’re just a tiny amount compared with billions of asians.
3819 2018-12-20 18:05:07 It would seem he quantified lots of Alta/ Sask positions. EE cancelation purely political by Fed Libs. Most PQ would prefer oil by pipeline than rail and tanker. Same hipocracy on west coast. That's all oil producers are disappointed in. He clarified that very well
3820 2018-12-20 18:04:57 Hellloooo it’s for oil. It always has been where have you been for 50 years?
3821 2018-12-20 18:04:52 Big oil has paid for our social programs, have invested in new research. They have been innovating new tech, training their workers. You say you worked in industry...tell me what plants you have worked in?
3822 2018-12-20 18:04:42 Why does getting my oil changed stress me out so much lol
3823 2018-12-20 18:04:41 In and independent Scotland we could tax the oil companies based on revenue rather than profit. Seems to work better for the ppl of Norway that way than ours does at the moment, specially with shell oil doubling it's revenue but somehow reporting no profits.
3824 2018-12-20 18:04:17 Really?  The workers are the ones who build pipelines (that should be obvious) and resulting oil flow to coast will create drilling, land reclaimation and associated jobs ie: lodging, meals, real estate & auto purchases etc.  No work=no taxes=no tax revenue for gov't. Get it?
3825 2018-12-20 18:04:05 He handed out billions for pipelines. And adopted all of Harper’s climate science denying policies. You big oil puppet party members are a joke.
3826 2018-12-20 18:04:03 I liked POTUS original idea of taking the oil to compensate our expenses!

3827 2018-12-20 18:03:59 NYers gonna be pissed when the largest public beach in the country - Jones Beach - experiences an oil spill.  And there go the Hamptons... and so much for Fire Island... and down the shore... then you have the Outer Banks... and the Chesapeake... yeah... NO.
3828 2018-12-20 18:03:54 Ooo I’ve never tried that? Where do you get them from? I just threw my favourite bathbomb in and some essential lavender oil
3829 2018-12-20 18:03:54 Report shows Exhibit 1510 violates to this day sanctions on North Korea. N.K is fully operating in Uganda.

Manhattan court convicts one Chinese Patrick Ho on corruption, Exhibits 1510, 1504 were paid $1mln to influence oil deal in Uganda.

Then your useless org gives an award???
3830 2018-12-20 18:03:39 I prefer John Getty’s advice for becoming wealthy: wake up early, work hard, find oil 
3831 2018-12-20 18:03:31 We have our own oil. We give Israel a lot of money.  Focus efforts on getting rid of terrorists already here
3832 2018-12-20 18:03:21 Easy to blame interest rates reality is a large number of the financial problems are due to the federal government attack on the oil industry and Alberta economy. I know dozens of people unemployed or under employed 100% due to government policy Not politically correct to say so
3833 2018-12-20 18:03:17 Gas prices going down right before the holidays and right after @POTUS disagreed with @CIA about #kashoggi murder. #ThingsThatMakeMeGoHmm What oil rich country could help influence gas prices by flooding the market;thereby, decreasing gas prices?

The [recent] oil crisis is relatively new [couple months] Kenney had the time to speak to thousands of oil execs between all his meetings with used car salesmen, catholic schools & dark money reps, etc?
3839 2018-12-20 18:02:46 Question is when to re-enter? I have already re-entered in the oil stocks now slowly turning redirecting monthly contributions to VINIX.

3844 2018-12-20 18:02:10 Our largest oil cos like shell and imperial plus a majority consensus of chambers of commerce  recognize global warming and the effects of carbon buildup and the taxing problem of making polluters pay,that our dinosaur Reformers like kenney and church based UCP refuse to pay

3847 2018-12-20 18:02:07 I hate coming to get an oil change. These niggas always tryna upsell.
3848 2018-12-20 18:01:58 So you believe electric vehicles are the answer, are the going to run on lithium batteries or something else?  Lithium  mines are worse the pulling oil for he environment so we need something better then those.

3854 2018-12-20 18:01:28 Does  anybody know why we are in Syria?  Answer, Syria was building a pipe line to supply oil to Europe.  Russia wanted to supply oil to Europe.  In the end, who cares who supplies oil to Europe?  Why do we need to spend tax payer dollars when Europe is already buy oil from Russi

3864 2018-12-20 18:00:36 Worried that the bulk oil used at an oil and lube shop is a lower quality than bottled oil? The truth is that oil manufacturers package the same high-quality oil in bulk and small quantities, but the bulk size makes oil cheaper, so they can pass the savings on to you.
3865 2018-12-20 18:00:36 Yes.  Been doing that since diagnosed.  And CBD oil.  And everything else under the sun in addition to what docs are doing.  (My) Cancer is just too aggressive.  But...so am I.  So.

3870 2018-12-20 18:00:17 Agree!  As long as lactate production is matched by clearance it's useful potential energy. This simple intervention (just 0.05ml oil/500ml water/10 days) could benefit those increasing where lactate accumulation or turn point could effect endurance. (Meamarbashi & Rajabi, 2013)

3879 2018-12-20 17:59:34 If you have an old bare steel oil tank in the ground, then tank removal is going to be your most cost effective option. Even if you have it tested for leaks, there is no way to predict what will happen next month or even next year. Your best bet to avoid a costly leak is to...
3880 2018-12-20 17:59:33 ... and professor, don't you also find it curious that the US Govt invaded Iraq *after* Saddam Hussein began selling oil in EURO? Or US Govt proxies killed Muammar Gaddafi *after* he announced the sale of Libyan oil in gold backed Dinar?
3881 2018-12-20 17:59:31 Lmao we have been there since the early 1900’s it’s strategic for the USA. The only thing that gives our dollar value is oil.  We are there to protect our money.
3882 2018-12-20 17:59:23 People are divided because they have different concerns, so that argument is emotional nonsense.  I could just as easily say that Alberta is pitting people against people by insisting the rest of Canada kowtow to the oil industry's demands.

3885 2018-12-20 17:59:03 @JHToyota what’s the point of making an appointment? I did for an oil change and was still (ridiculously) told 60-90 minutes. 120 minutes later here I sit, with no update. Poor customer service.

3889 2018-12-20 17:58:32 Oil is quite a lot lower so He doesn’t want to have to fund the leave campaign a second time.
3890 2018-12-20 17:58:26 God has set HIS own parameters for finding HIM, to ignore and look elsewhere is folly. There's a place where oil or gold is found, you don't seek them in places they are not found.

God has placed himself in the realm of faith so that "he that cometh to him, must believe that HE

Thanks?
3893 2018-12-20 17:58:15 That's not entirely accurate. The oil sands producers have supported Alberta climate policy, backed carbon pricing, and are busy innovating to drive down the carbon-intensity of heavy crude below the US average. I.e. not ignoring climate commitments.

3897 2018-12-20 17:58:09 Great news! Now all that is needed is a lynching.

I propose amendments to also ban guillotines, boiling in oil, casting of spells, drawing and quartering, and duelling with muskets without a permit.
3898 2018-12-20 17:58:07 Nah. All he had to do was accept it. He saw a boiling pot of oil and dunked his head into it. Dumbass, through and through.
3899 2018-12-20 17:58:00 After chemist Roger Adams first extracted CBD in the 1940s, research continued well into the 1960s. That's when tests were completed on primates and researchers were able to produce the first CBD oil intended for therapeutic use. British Pharmacopoeia was the first to release it

3903 2018-12-20 17:57:44 Ok so this a question for the black girls... what do y’all use on your hair? What’s the best product. And is using coconut oil good for your hair? What helps with knots and stuff?
3904 2018-12-20 17:57:40 isnt the dark bottle to protect the oil from light?
3905 2018-12-20 17:57:39 It’s extremely sad when they can do steroids but not CBD oil,  but either way you’re 100% correct he’s just one of the many who happened to get caught

3907 2018-12-20 17:57:27 The number of people now jobless in Nigeria is twice the population of  Sweden. Next Level unemployment might be the size of the UK. Imagine what will happen when the price of oil declines to 40 dollars per barrel next year. @officialKolaO @OfficialPDPNig @SweetShantel
3908 2018-12-20 17:57:26 How many anti oil people live in Edmonton and Leduc? This is the fucking heartland. Maybe they should try stabbing the tires to their rigs to show people how serious they are about this too. Overall poorly planned.
3909 2018-12-20 17:57:17 That Coconut Oil do wonders for your skin ,stay moisturized whores.
3910 2018-12-20 17:57:10 You're absolutely right. Gender is a single edged sword that only cuts one way. When there's opportunity there are no gender roles, but when there's responsibility gender roles are part of life. You can't ask for a sandwich but she'll still ask for an oil change.
3911 2018-12-20 17:57:10 Why y'all sleeping on "Oil it - Mr Killa"?
3912 2018-12-20 17:57:09 So keep WATCH. You do not know on what day your Lord will come. (Matt 24:42). Let us keep WATCH by PREPARING for the return of Christ, having more than sufficient OIL to last you until the groom comes. How do you OIL your life? By having faith in Jesus Christ & OBEYING God's Word

3917 2018-12-20 17:56:29 Someone has to help me understand how the stock market can be tanking, oil prices are down, and the Fed is jacking up rates while we are flooded with all of this wonderful ‘Kohl’s Cash’!
3918 2018-12-20 17:56:28 Was busy somewhere yesterday when my sister casually mentioned making palm oil stew soon.
With catfish and diced ponmo.
DESTABILIZED MY DAY!

Who does that? 
3919 2018-12-20 17:56:15 Just doing a bit of blogging and editing while I wait on my car’s oil change...
3920 2018-12-20 17:55:52 So? Its also a dream scenario for our vets and soldiers. The public has asked to get out of the wars for a long time. The only ones who arent benefitting from this are the oil and military industries.
3921 2018-12-20 17:55:52 I don't eat there because I am allergic to shellfish and became kosher/vegetarian in 1996. I do remember that the Silver Spring restaurant was very nice when I went (with a friend's parents) and made me a pasta dish with garlic and oil- almost free!
3922 2018-12-20 17:55:45 shea or cocoa butter, also jojoba oil and turmeric i’ve heard
3923 2018-12-20 17:55:38 Remember when the performative anti-racist left was all aflutter at Beto's support of the Nike sponsored taking the knee crowd? @davidsirota reports he was a big bank+oil industry's guy all along: not 1st X neoliberalism injected its toxins via ID politics. Won't be the last.
3924 2018-12-20 17:55:33 Follow the $$ and oil. Wait, we have oil. Perhaps the better strategy was to quietly give it 3 months. Keep close eye on Israel, keep tightening screws on Russia/Syria. God bless our military families.
3925 2018-12-20 17:55:33 My brother’s boyfriend was over last night and my baby oil is missing. COINCIDENCE?? I think not!! 
3926 2018-12-20 17:55:30 Real quick, how much Saudi oil do we import?
3927 2018-12-20 17:55:28 hey also this reminds me of two things: have you taught any of those c19 petro-narratives? suggestions as to what I might add to my Oil, Culture, Environment syllabus this term? also, I want to teach something of YOURS, but not just the LARB piece. Got something to share?
3928 2018-12-20 17:55:21 Yes. My question meant to raise possibility of a more macro, complex & sophisticated discussion of #oil w/application of knowledge on table. But I didn't dare such ambitious expectations . An #export #tax on crude, products could pay refinery upgrade expense for industry. #OOTT
3929 2018-12-20 17:55:20 Usapang oil because why not. Hahahahahaa. The lola-ness naman talaga, oo! 
3930 2018-12-20 17:55:18 If you though 'economist' Harper knew nothing of economics demonstrated by putting all economic eggs in 1 resource extraction basket, Andrew Scheer knows even less. Is more wealth creation, productivity growth in the value-added sector than oil; not to mention better job creation
3931 2018-12-20 17:55:13 Don’t you want all that lovely Oil
3932 2018-12-20 17:55:10 Oil rigs going up now?
3933 2018-12-20 17:55:10 buying oil for my car is a nuisance
3934 2018-12-20 17:55:04 Sige! Prawn crackers pa, Juni! Hanap Efficascent Oil ka tuloy. Ano? Ulitin mo pa!
3935 2018-12-20 17:55:02 oil carried most the GDP YTD and also has a big chunk of the debt. Watch out below.
3936 2018-12-20 17:55:00 US produces more oil now than Saudis. Its a big reason for oil softness and its steadily rising. Fracking heavily financed by WS. Not quite a subprime problem though

US oil production will decline 
we just have to watch the rig productivity (barrels/day)
reality will tell when
3937 2018-12-20 17:54:52 When I was on the Hall beach searching with a friend a guy came over and said his mate had 4 very large tubs the size of oil barrels filled with seaglass. He's been collecting for years and reckons the pieces are very small now compared with when he started.
3938 2018-12-20 17:54:42 People think the government *can't* regulate behemoth businesses - internet giants, Wall Street, big oil. This is absolutely untrue. Government has stopped regulating these powers, but it can do it again. Someday it will.
3939 2018-12-20 17:54:37 is this a joke or??? Cause how else did this shit end up on MY of all people's timeline 
3940 2018-12-20 17:54:29 1/4 cup vinegar to 1/2 cup Olive oil and 1 mashed garlic... I liberally used it and saved the next.. shelf life for the dressing would be at least 10 more days
3941 2018-12-20 17:54:22 For healthy shiny hair use a hot oil treatment once a week.
3942 2018-12-20 17:53:35 Como harías con la RENTA PETROLERA. El Estado venezolano no puede colocar toda la vida las divisas. Dependemos mucho del OIL.
3943 2018-12-20 17:53:23 My cars got an oil change appointment at 2pm today ughhhh
3944 2018-12-20 17:53:22 CBD on its own can show in drug tests, as it contains trace elements of THC. An oil with THC will definitely show.
3945 2018-12-20 17:52:52 Absolutely. Trumpies complain they can't make ends meet, but they're sending that snake oil salesman money. Seriously? How stupid can people possibly be (don't answer)?
3946 2018-12-20 17:52:49 i love da Jankees and i love a new oil change from Tucci Tyuhhs
3947 2018-12-20 17:52:43 Also got given massage oil by a parent as a Christmas present today. Not sure what to make of that.
3948 2018-12-20 17:52:42 No. I don’t believe that deep down, or at the surface. As soon as I saw him at the podium I recognized the snake oil salesman. He said yesterday ISIS was defeated. When literally everyone said that wasn’t so, he changed comments. That’s all he does. He does what suits HIM.
3949 2018-12-20 17:52:39 News article: "This amazing artist uses only bird seeds to create stunning works of art that look like meticulously crafted oil paintings from the Renaissance!"

3951 2018-12-20 17:52:36 "After paying $4.5 billion to Kinder Morgan and committing $10 billion more to reconstruct the old pipeline, Canada announced another $1.6 billion in oil industry support. " That is NOT what action on climate change looks like!
3952 2018-12-20 17:52:30 He got away with it because his base bought his showman snake oil shows. Jobs, they thought, would make their lives great, again. I hated to write that.
3953 2018-12-20 17:52:26 It is interesting that Trump was cheering for lower oil prices as the US is now a net exporter. So lower oil prices are a marginal negative for the US as a whole and a net benefit for Europe, China, India.
3954 2018-12-20 17:52:24 How important can the oil be anyway???
3955 2018-12-20 17:52:11 i drank a whole vial of cbd oil last night when i was hammered...
3956 2018-12-20 17:52:04 Oil markets facing a lot of downwards pressure, it’s time to buy now but there’s still more downside. Hard to trade the technicals on ETF’s
3957 2018-12-20 17:52:01 1. prevent further refugee crisis in Europe. 2. Preserve the BOP in ME & ensure the free flow of oil at market prices in PG. 3. to prevent wider war between Israel, Iran in Syria (ie. further destabilization). 4. prevent Russia from attempting to dominate ME. 5. US prestige 1/2
3958 2018-12-20 17:51:59 Syria is NOT your country and not your backyard. You there illegally having committed many war crimes in Syria as well. Get out of Syria and don't come back. You DISGUST me with your war mongering. You don't give a too hoots about Syria except for stealing it's oil. 
3959 2018-12-20 17:51:58 Lol you that os Nigeria's greatest asset after oil, what have you benefited your Family not to talk of your neighbour mugu!
3960 2018-12-20 17:51:50 He got a 30% trump score/92% vote with party score by voting for GOP priorities 8% of the time. If you want to defend any of these votes—to lift the oil export ban, allow drilling in Gulf of Mexico, weaken CBP hiring standards, dismantle ACA payment advisory board—I’m all ears
3961 2018-12-20 17:51:44 This reminds me. I really need to look for a nice hydrating oil to incorporate into my winter routinue.
3962 2018-12-20 17:51:38 I don’t care about the price. Give me 1 reason why it’s better for us to be importing Saudi oil and supporting their economy rather than our own. everyone in canada uses oil every day. so yes the demand for product is still there
3963 2018-12-20 17:51:37 Thanks for proving this was nothing more than a political gimmick. #CONs in power 10yrs & no pipeline to tide water = #CON supporters hold 0 protests, 0 bitching, only now conveniently decide to loss your shit? Oil patch job losses? Newsflash: that’s been the oil patch forever.
3964 2018-12-20 17:51:32 my mom put some kinda oil on my wrists to help with my anxiety... it smells good but my skin feels funny jdjeisjjwjs
3965 2018-12-20 17:51:23 My aunt used castor oil mixed with aloe vera for my cousin as a kid
3966 2018-12-20 17:51:21 I’m leaving the island soon. Right into lower mainland. Can’t wait. Starting new job. More money more work there. Make more in Vancouver than I made in oil patch
3967 2018-12-20 17:51:15 The day I’m going to change my oil and it’s raining all day 
3968 2018-12-20 17:51:15 Yeah, but they want their characters to get where they're going, as opposed to breaking down in a cloud of oil smoke and disappointment.
3969 2018-12-20 17:50:59 So now that CBD oil is about to be legal I wonder if these social media platforms will finally take our advertsing money?

Not that I really want to give it to them at this point. 
3970 2018-12-20 17:50:54 Is this going to be like palm oil, where we destroy a whole habitat and increase pollution?
3971 2018-12-20 17:50:48 hard same oil
3972 2018-12-20 17:50:46 You stolen oil for decades and after shale gas go back at home... ok perfect but must be the same in Afghanistan, for Iran, about the war that your friend of Saud are making against Yemen....
3973 2018-12-20 17:50:46 I was coppin’ these all white disposable joints called Bloom pens. Still haven’t an oil that taste, smells and hits like those.

3978 2018-12-20 17:50:21 Oil isn't evil. Oil magnates and companies by nature, are.
3979 2018-12-20 17:50:16 Is anyone among you sick? Let them call the elders of the church to pray over them & anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord. & the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well; the Lord will raise them up. If they have sinned, they will b forgiven. ~ James 5:14-15
3980 2018-12-20 17:50:14 He could LITERALLY sell them snake oil!
3981 2018-12-20 17:49:53 We're making room for the 2019s so ALL INVENTORY MUST GO! It's the Blizzard super sale, mounts 40% under the sticker price with a free oil change!

3983 2018-12-20 17:49:48 Yep. @SpeakerRyan has created millions of $$$'s worth of income for the banksmen, the insurance CEOs, medical rackets, Exxon, & the oil company bosses. They're going to be just fine, thanks to him. And the American workers get an extra 2 cents/hour. What a swell guy.
3984 2018-12-20 17:49:45 He is clearing a path for Russia, Hezbollah, Houthi's to reclaim Mecca from the Wahabbist House of Saud. Russia gets access to the Gulf, the Mediterranean and all the oil they need to shift the balance of power in their direction. Lebanon, Syria, N-Yemen, Iraq, Bahrain all Shia.
3985 2018-12-20 17:49:45 why come to the conclusion I dont think we need the oil industry ,and as a hd mechanic-millwright I know better  that in our northern climate we cant survive without fuel, but when they now grow corn for silage where I homesteaded north of high level,so there is global warming
3986 2018-12-20 17:49:17 u gotta throw the whole fam out now :)
3987 2018-12-20 17:49:08 ああオイル、どうして君はオイルなんだ…
3988 2018-12-20 17:49:02 you use oil everyday but are bitching about a movement to try and get a pipeline built. ya you’re an idiot
3989 2018-12-20 17:49:00 SA will crawl through glass to hurt Iran. That's why they were behaving that way. 

That's the danger of accepting the dumb narratives offered by analysts like "Trump played SA." Trump isn't smart enough about oil to play anyone except himself (which he did w/ IR sanctions!).
3990 2018-12-20 17:48:54 NASA has some easy-to-understand videos on Youtube.  You should watch them and stop being manipulated by oil lobbyists.
3991 2018-12-20 17:48:50 Credit spreads have been widening since March.  TIPS break-evens have been collapsing for 2-months after going sideways all summer.  Oil is collapsing.  Curve shows a bit of inversion.  Stocks - better late than never - are acting very badly.  If it isn't a recession, it's close.
3992 2018-12-20 17:48:50 Most of these oil companies have targets that have to be met for shareholders for BOE. If those targets are not met the companies shrivel up and die. Production also has to stay up to keep market share. If market share is lost to another country it is hard to get it back.
3993 2018-12-20 17:48:48 you can try rosehip oil mixed with frankincense essential oil!!! it helps heal and regenerate skin
3994 2018-12-20 17:48:42 I brought an all day Yarmouth area bus ticket.
Cost £4:50.
Paid for itself.
Other bargains in #morrisons were Olivio Olive oil £2 and Willow butter 78p.
My bills today was being held up by dick Turpin.
Seriously..

3996 2018-12-20 17:48:33 I want a so hot a sexy boobs pussy and need more fun with oil massage or hard fucking
3997 2018-12-20 17:48:31 อีนี่ น่าลากมาตบ!!
3998 2018-12-20 17:48:25 I just need to know where to get the sesame oil
3999 2018-12-20 17:48:15 Call me paranoid but 2 days after huge Russian oil tanker (landing craft) lands off UK coast, UK airport closed coz of drones, UK army called in. President Putin's puppet withdraws troops from Syria, Putin openly interferes with brexit/talks up nuclear war. Connect the  dots?
4000 2018-12-20 17:48:07 So I am not good at #cooking #bacon. I am not good at cooking. So I do it in the oven to keep away from the whole popping oil mess. And, I burnt half of them... What to make with burnt bacon..
4001 2018-12-20 17:47:47 Cooking oils have viscosity, boiling points and Roils, too! Yes, olive oil burns quicker than...turn it down when...  It does a body good.
4002 2018-12-20 17:47:45 Hyaluronic acid serum or Palmer's skin oil therapy
4003 2018-12-20 17:47:43 US markets are getting rocked and oil is in free fall
4004 2018-12-20 17:47:42 I’ll be starting at an oil rig up in Pennsylvania! With everything they’ve told me so far it honestly sounds so great. I can’t wait to start 
4005 2018-12-20 17:47:42 Reality is American's who hold majority of Resource leases Do Not Want a pipeline to "Tidewater" they're just fine with how things are now. They Control our Oil/Natural Gas & status quo works well for them. FYI for those saying Cdns don't care "pipelines don't pop up over night"
4006 2018-12-20 17:47:42 I have,  do get some facts big oil has been hoodwinking AB forever. I want both pipes by the way. But let’s get of oil ASAP.Have a great Christmas
4007 2018-12-20 17:47:37 Fly traps, squirrel rotating devices,  oil plates, these are some of the ways I would attemp to build a wall to keep them at bay I also would create the simplistic way to build a wall with the future to add to it at a later date to create it harder for them
4008 2018-12-20 17:47:32 Great simple line from @TeamCavuto guest a moment ago re: gas/oil, etc prices: “Commodity prices don’t drive the economy, they are a function of the economy.” Sorry, missed his name.
4009 2018-12-20 17:47:26 "Fries."

Getting a knife, and a potato.

"It's really simple."
"Do you have a thing of boiling hot oil?"

Cutting.
4010 2018-12-20 17:47:25 Ok so, take a bunch of tin foil and then get some olive oil n bread and spread that shit n broil it for like 10 minutes until it's crispy. Post results
4011 2018-12-20 17:47:25 And they will check your oil for you
4012 2018-12-20 17:47:23 You have anything you prefer? I use Murphy’s Oil now about twice a year
4013 2018-12-20 17:47:22 Not happening, get used to that. People need to start thinking about their futures outside of oil and gas. (They don’t have to, it’s no skin off my back if they don’t. But I’ve had to do it, so they would be advised to start doing it too).
4014 2018-12-20 17:47:21 Try CBD oil!! It really helps with temporary relief for anxiety
4015 2018-12-20 17:47:08 Oil isn't involved this time.
4016 2018-12-20 17:47:07 Actually we're just another neoliberal pro-business hellscape fucking over workers, people of colour and indigenous people while we sell weapons to murderous regimes and build pipelines that no one wants except oil companies.
4017 2018-12-20 17:47:04 .@CarnivalPLC
#CarnivalCorporation, the #cruise ship giant, is polluting the Arctic, harming #wildlife and communities
#Carnival Arctic ships use heavy fuel oil that releases enormous amounts of toxins, heavy metals, greenhouse gases, and soot into the atmosphere.
4018 2018-12-20 17:46:52 Well that's anti-human! Just because humans are helping to green the planet and pull the earth out a near CO2 starvation you believe that's a problem? Oh, and you believe oil is the remnant of dinosaurs? How is it some became fossils and some became oil?
.
4019 2018-12-20 17:46:50 there’s also the possibility that he has donors that he’s not telling people about - more cases like those oil executives who “don’t qualify as a PAC but are powerful enough to be one anyway” which would be extremely 
4020 2018-12-20 17:46:47 Oil shill says wut?
4021 2018-12-20 17:46:43 December 20, 1987
In the worst peacetime sea disaster, the passenger ferry Doña Paz sinks after colliding with the oil tanker Vector in the Tablas Strait in the Philippines, killing an estimated 4,000 people (1,749 official).

4023 2018-12-20 17:46:39 This Christmas I’m getting 4 snow tires, 2 new wheels and an oil change. It’s only going to cost me $1850
4024 2018-12-20 17:46:38 Being boiled in oil would be better.
4025 2018-12-20 17:46:30 Have you considered including CBD oil? CBD positively interacts with the body's endocannabinoid system which regulates vital functions mood, hormone production, and stress and immune system responses.
4026 2018-12-20 17:46:24 Just spent 300$ to top off my oil tank and then my thermostat in my room won’t turn off and it’s stuck on at 80° I could die
4027 2018-12-20 17:46:11 Check your Transmission oil this morning.
4028 2018-12-20 17:46:11 If I break your heart na oil spillage
Nne I study this your love for freedom college
4029 2018-12-20 17:46:11 It’s a risky game. Could cause chaos in the streets of Moscow leading Putin to create a crisis in attempt to drive oil back up.

4031 2018-12-20 17:46:04 Since Facebook has serially exploited "users" and ignored USA & EU laws I have deleted my pages and account. It can't be fixed. The Advertisers are the real users. The "targeted" ads depends on illegal exploitation. It may even be fake snake oil, but Advertisers believe it.

4037 2018-12-20 17:45:50 I’ve always used russets, and poached in oil for longer and at lower temps. Even my flipping technique is different — I’ve always slid it onto to the plate bottom side down, then put the pan on top and flipped. You’re a renegade, Gritzer!

4040 2018-12-20 17:45:34 @TheAA_UK @TheRAC_UK oil prices super low yet uk fuel prices still high.
4041 2018-12-20 17:45:31 For aftercare, try using a massage oil
4042 2018-12-20 17:45:11 Indebted Middle Eastern countries, mainly the Governments of Jordan and Lebanon, will be further hurt by rising debt servicing costs higher cost....Oil Prices will continue to tumble by reason of lower demands and over supply....6
4043 2018-12-20 17:45:10 Go ahead- land lock all your precious oil reserves 
4044 2018-12-20 17:44:59 decided to put my leftover fettuccine alfredo in the microwave to warm it up, big mistake. i started out with pasta covered in creamy alfredo sauce and ended up with pasta drenched in a cup of olive oil
4045 2018-12-20 17:44:55 If Turkish backed rebels manage to take the oil fields and particularly the Omar oil field, It would be a victory for both, Turkey and TFSA !
4046 2018-12-20 17:44:53 I went to Valvoline for the first time yesterday to get my oil changed...bruh why didn't I know about them sooner!! They had me in and out in 15 minutes and you sit in your car while they do it...never going anywhere else sitting for over an hour again!!
4047 2018-12-20 17:44:52 And back massages with the oil  oh and they have to tickle your back too
4048 2018-12-20 17:44:51 took my car in for an oil change, need a brake replacement. bye bye money. I LOVE BEING AN ADULT.
4049 2018-12-20 17:44:46 PERFUME IS COMJNG BACK TO NY yeah i get castor oil for this is called a bbq what the morning is uzo aduba because yes it
4050 2018-12-20 17:44:43 Buhari has funds...atiku has funds but can't bring it into the country... Are you aware of the container full of dollars Tht was seized recently... 2019 is about the battle of the renewal of oil licenses...poverty and the mass is the pawn being used... Forget all this noise.
4051 2018-12-20 17:44:39 We completely agree - fast fashion as a trend is incredibly destructive, but the recent trend in putting fashion as a bigger polluter than it is has diverted attention from oil&gas or livestock production for example - polluters that need to be addressed!
4052 2018-12-20 17:44:38 Even he underestimated how dim-witted $TSLAQ is. He couldn't foresee they'd double down in the face of record profits. Now it will take $TSLA paying off the converts. Who knows what $TSLAQ (aka Big Oil lemmings) will think of next?
4053 2018-12-20 17:44:38 I'm thinking homeopathy is another.

4058 2018-12-20 17:44:20 I agree. We don’t need the Middle East, we don’t even need its oil - so what are we doing there?
4059 2018-12-20 17:44:04 Best creation: Oil for stress.  someone gifted me Danara Oil for sleep relaxation and I never felt so good in a long time. Literally. Love the smell and the feels.
4060 2018-12-20 17:44:01 I hope they shut down all the city for those cause. Than maybe some of the left winger might start to realize that love it or hate it, western Canada needs oil to survive.
4061 2018-12-20 17:43:57 If the Middle East has no cash money to pay for USA when needed, then there are other alternatives to pay the bill, Oil, Gas, then all is done

4066 2018-12-20 17:43:38 Only thing that can "save" #Kurds is to FULLY EMBRACE #Damascus ASAP & BEG for IMMEDIATE #SAA & #Russia|n forces deplyment in border w/ #Turkey, #Manbij, #Raqqa and ALL other main Cities, plus in ALL ILLEGAL bases used by West forces as they evac & ALSO in the Oil & Gas Fields.
4067 2018-12-20 17:43:38 Republicans and other world oil producers are thankful because this helps to squash a new direction in renewable and safe energy.
4068 2018-12-20 17:43:31 It’s ok with you to send 180 million to Honduras,Guatemala and El’Salvador in 2019 though.  I mean your building a wall to specifically keep them out !? Meanwhile we are freezing in the north because of inflated fuel oil ,even though we are leading the world in oil production.
4069 2018-12-20 17:43:30 i've been using this oil blend as everything from a hair oil to a massage oil & it smells so good i use it as cologne sometimes
4070 2018-12-20 17:43:26 I cannot express the depths of my disappointment that rosemary oil does not particularly smell like rosemary and instead has a minty enemy smell...
4071 2018-12-20 17:43:26 your face looks like a canvas full of oil paint

4075 2018-12-20 17:43:02 Down after my oil change thooooo
4076 2018-12-20 17:43:00 Nah. Irving Oil has been importing overseas for a long time. Their refinery isn't equipped to handle AB bitumen either, and they shelved a plan to upgrade several years ago as well. This idea that Energy East had a retroactive play on market forces isn't based in reality.
4077 2018-12-20 17:42:56 Jon, this is seriously sad.  First it was oil/fuel costs so they raised prices, then fees for bags, next huge crazy fees and then this, fees for seats only closer to the exit/boarding door.  Sad.... and MAD!
4078 2018-12-20 17:42:56 yeah, ad drops to detergent, to shampoo, to cleaning soaps, to laundry ... its awesome! Ad drops to vaseline, to skin oil its amazing!

4080 2018-12-20 17:42:43 They better get some wild growth oil or make something shake then 
4081 2018-12-20 17:42:38 So the oil is sneakily being stored in Westminster!

How dare they.
4082 2018-12-20 17:42:34 Gotta add one of my favorite stories from the Prize: the Supreme Court ordered the breakup of The Standard Oil Company. CEO John Archbold immediately went back & reported to the BOD with this terrific line:

"Well, gentlemen, life's just one damn thing after another"
4083 2018-12-20 17:42:31 Temporary nonvoting share takeovers of banks happened after GFC & some places pay profits from a major industry as a dividend to citizens, mostly oil economies: Alaska pays citizens' dividend of oil profits + some Gulf countries, iirc.

4084 2018-12-20 17:42:31 ...so if I put the high-CBD oil AND the 85% pure THC oil in the tea at the SAME TIME...

4089 2018-12-20 17:42:20 But, mainly or geopolitical purposes.  However, there is no question that most Albertans are oil industry zombies who regurgitate a lot of false industry propaganda and who have an enormous sense of entitlement.
4090 2018-12-20 17:42:17 And if the USA has to be there in the Middle East again, then what is the price?! Gas and Oil for sure.
4091 2018-12-20 17:42:10 i have an oil blend i made for my hair when i first loc'd up the bottle is almost empty & i will never forgive myself for not writing the recipe down
4092 2018-12-20 17:42:06 There are plenty of reasons why the market is down, Trade/Tariffs causing slow growth,Central Banks tightening, Oil collapsing

4095 2018-12-20 17:41:21 Yes! Same thing with drive through oil change places. I am always scared I will drive into the hole in the floor. 
4096 2018-12-20 17:41:16 While I would normally agree with that and this is all about Russia, the new strategy is obvious since Diplomacy has failed, Russia visit to Venezuela, attacking Ukrainian ships, taking hostages and ships oil is up to bat, being used as a diplomatic tool.
4097 2018-12-20 17:41:16 The Shork report more like the Jorts report, commenting on gas and oil based on his personal plug in car. Useless. Stupid even
4098 2018-12-20 17:41:00 When you "fix the market," will you give Big Pharma a seat at the table the way Obama did? Will they have influence over how the law is written the way Shell Oil wrote the Paris Climate Accord?
4099 2018-12-20 17:40:48 Actually vegans out of everyone researches the fuck outta our food and there are a few products we can get that have  sustainable eco friendly palm oil. But the majority of us abstain from a lot of palm oil. More so than any non vegan who buys way more of it than we do

4) put some lip balm on to keep lips moisturised.

All this before bed/in the morning.

4109 2018-12-20 17:40:01 we just need to stop having @CIA assets training the radicals all over the middle east. when we stop training insurgents to destabilize oil rich countries, they wont have much of a reason to come over here anymore.  an ounce of prevention.

4112 2018-12-20 17:39:46 So is ceding the political space to folks who want to do more extreme versions of means testing, oil interests and a host of other things. At some point your political ethics has to include pragmatism.  A first-past-the-post system with 2 realistic candidates is one of them.

4114 2018-12-20 17:39:41 The GoC cancelled energy east denying access to Canadian oil to our Canadian refineries. The open market is forced then to import oil. So the government has interfered negatively in the market and can reverse the impact.
4115 2018-12-20 17:39:41 They deliberately diverted their parade to block the airport and snarl the Henday during rush hour because of a court ruling in BC and an oil glut that's largely being caused by the US. How does hindering/hurting fellow Albertans fix those things?

4118 2018-12-20 17:39:36 I thought it was 13%. But like he said. All on the island bitcoin about oil and gas as you catch a ferry and have a barge bring you and your “Evil” fuel to you guys so you can drive around and Sing cumb by ya my lord David Suzuki. The man that has made MILLIONS from this
4119 2018-12-20 17:39:11 #UKOG are doing it the right way round. Whats the use of a PL with not one drop of oil . Watch and learn #ANGS
4120 2018-12-20 17:39:09 So I'm doing some research on essential oils for Xmas gifts. Who is the sicko that thought of baby oil?
4121 2018-12-20 17:39:08 P3

I googled all this. Trump has been busy in the Mediterranean. 

October 2017: Tump met with Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras to shore up economic and defense cooperation with the key NATO ally. U.S. Investments in Greek  oil  resources and military bases

See P4
4122 2018-12-20 17:39:05 Use castor oil
4123 2018-12-20 17:39:04 Oil and water usually don't mix
But because milk has magical chemicals in it, it's a water-based liquid with several different kinds of oils in it
Separating these oils out and changing their relationship with the water and dissolved other stuff is literally the dairy industry
4124 2018-12-20 17:39:02 But what is confusing is that the term grifter originates more with snake oil salesmen, tonic peddlars, and confidence men of the early 20th century. 2/2
4125 2018-12-20 17:38:45 Also as I Predicted ,Oil was Far too high I see more downside on WTX don't be surprise to see WTX below $40.00, I see it at $35.00, OPEC no longer dictate OIL
4126 2018-12-20 17:38:45 *starts imagining what seasoning with walnut oil might be like* 
4127 2018-12-20 17:38:45 Iss like you have found job for him in oil company.
4128 2018-12-20 17:38:40 I think Obama was more CHRISTIAN than POTUS .
lets see he had one wife , did not sleep with a porn star unprotected sex .
and  then  have sex with FLOTUS . How insulting and gross 
You my friend are a  good SNAKE oil dealer .
4129 2018-12-20 17:38:38 Pra onde vai inflação americana com esse oil?
4130 2018-12-20 17:38:37 Trying to take some time for yourself to do something you enjoy!!!  (Hard to do I know) but I use my oil diffuser and put lavender oil in it before bed. Really calms me and helps me sleep
4131 2018-12-20 17:38:37 Almost 2019
-People still smoking just out of a cool pen looking thing that lights up. 
- CBD oil is the new xanax
- McDonald’s delivers 
- Atkins diet is back it’s just called Keto
- Radio is back, it’s just called Podcast 
- My ex gf is still my ex just way happier
4132 2018-12-20 17:38:34 Sirotas ideology boils down to "owning the libs". His post on oil employees donations was embarrassing.
4133 2018-12-20 17:38:31 Tried warming my jollof rice then i mixed it with the small fried egg in the frying pan without pouring the oil out 
I'm basically eating Fried Jollof rice now  God safe me
4134 2018-12-20 17:38:22 $PBIO Only 1.8M outsanding. A small run will move this back to the $3 range. The developments of water soluble #cbd oil and new breakthroughs in improving #cancer diagnosis will help do so.
4135 2018-12-20 17:38:20 Wearing this Peppermint Oil & Cocoa Sheet Mask while watching A Misers' Brothers Christmas has me feelin' quite festive 
4136 2018-12-20 17:38:15 $USO Massive 4 mil print $9.79 Bullish above $10 Bearish below $9.50 big move coming in oil!
4137 2018-12-20 17:38:07 We'll get there. But remember to factor in total cost of ownership. Fuel costs way lower. No oil changes. Fewer parts to wear out and replace. Also, resale values on gas cars will plummet as EVs take over. As long as you hold onto your EV for 5-10 years, you'll save $1000s.
4138 2018-12-20 17:37:43 How did vote blue no matter who work out with Obama? We got exponential growth in fracking, pipelines and he opened up US oil and gas to exports for the first time in 40 years. I’ll vote for whoever has serious plans to rapidly transition off of fossil fuels, period.
4139 2018-12-20 17:37:37 Really? How in the Christ are oil companies operating in Alberta recording record profits if they’re all “Completely shut down” ffs? Fking bots. I suppose if you lived in Alberta, or North America for that matter, you’d know this.
4140 2018-12-20 17:37:35 Gun Oil is THAT girl.
4141 2018-12-20 17:37:29 @CalvinBook Michael: You very kindly signed some labels for me to put in your books.  Remember me from Gulf Oil/McLaren stuff?  Could you e-mail me with an address please - mwa.words@btinternet.com - I have a couple more in my collection!
4142 2018-12-20 17:37:20 If you somehow managed to make it through 2018 without listening to OIL OF EVERY PEARL'S UN-INSIDES by SOPHIE... you should fix that right now. I've listened to it so much this year, but it's still a journey each time.
4143 2018-12-20 17:37:17 President can hold Saudis on a gunpoint to reduce oil prices, but can't control his own appointed Fed to control the interest rates? #Dow
4144 2018-12-20 17:37:16 Just saying a oil change would do a lot for his press conference haha
4145 2018-12-20 17:37:14 السعر العادل للنفط يجب ان يكون اعلى من 80$، توجد ذيادة مطردة للنفط الخام في مجالات غير المواصلات، non - transport use of oil ، حيث وصل استخدام النفط في مجالات غير وقود المواصلات الى 50% في 2016

4148 2018-12-20 17:36:59 So what?  You got bike lanes!  Styrofoam is going away!  And the city is going to take down big oil and Immigration policy in DC.  Maybe if you are lucky one day a permanent police chief will be in office
4149 2018-12-20 17:36:50 Once upon a time developing oil resources & making weapons of war promised secure jobs etc. & now we have to live with the unintended consequences of allowing the corporatocracy of making these decisions. Will the general public ever get control of their destiny?
4150 2018-12-20 17:36:48 It’s worse than that… we’re the dirt the oil is extracted from 
4151 2018-12-20 17:36:32 Came In Here For A Oil Change & I Be Damn If They Say 50 Other Things Be Wrong 
4152 2018-12-20 17:36:31 you are drinking snake oil w this Qanon nonsense, not one thing has happened yet... THINK USE LOGIC!  You are being duped
4153 2018-12-20 17:35:58 Well, my flight took off, then made an emergency landing due to an enigine oil leak. We’ve de-planed. Mechanic is fixing it. They’ve given us snacks. I’m doing ok.
4154 2018-12-20 17:35:49 Interesting.. what do you bring to TE when they provide chicken and oil?
4155 2018-12-20 17:35:44 "Professor, don't you find it curious that the US government never cared about China stealing IP until China stopped buying USTs & then launched a CNY oil contract?"

4156 2018-12-20 17:35:37 petrol isn't getting more expensive... just more taxes.  Oil prices world wide are dropping...
4157 2018-12-20 17:35:33 i think he is stuck with the deals made. breaking those deals will require lawsuits and it's tough to fight big oil without bankrupting our state. 
MJ could provide enough income to help with the lawsuits.
I'm excited that Chester county DA is going after ETP.

next up PA state.
4158 2018-12-20 17:35:33 Next step fuelcells. Stop burning oil now please

4160 2018-12-20 17:35:14 So basically you are starting to realize that you got conned by a snake oil salesmen.   He didnt keep promises before he was president, and hasn't since he has become president.  No wall, no replacement for Obamacare, no balancing of the budget, no eliminating common core etc...
4161 2018-12-20 17:35:05 - rince with cold water this time 
- apply micellar water on a cotton ball and leave it air dry
- apply your daily face cream or almond oil 
- this is optional but I apply also sun block (unificateur in French)
4162 2018-12-20 17:35:05 Nobody said coal got in the turbine...

The Turbines are not operational due to seized bearings. Brass bearings trough which high pressure oil needs to by cycled continuously...
4163 2018-12-20 17:35:03 We need to invest into green engery and sell off all our oil to other countries and use that money to save our land and get green! We are stupid here for not doing such thing!
4164 2018-12-20 17:35:02 @Jeep I’m getting a oil change and the staff here a rascist and over charging me for a oil change lmao rude much.
4165 2018-12-20 17:35:02 They won't, unless oil prices strongly. #OOTT
4166 2018-12-20 17:35:02 Saudi could be chill and just pump oil and get on with things peacefully. It’s when it starts punching above its weight that it needs to be checked. They opted to take the risky route. They have to deal with the consequences
4167 2018-12-20 17:34:53 Lol. You are funded by Walmart, Murphy Oil, and the DemGaz. Stop lying to the people, Gary.. the only reason those folks are invested into Charters is to MAKE money. Non profit is a shell name and a lie.
4168 2018-12-20 17:34:53 Go for it. The first thing you'll need to do is beg for a treaty with Canada,  so you can get oil from your now landlocked country to a port.  Have fun!

4171 2018-12-20 17:34:23 Next step fuelcells . Stop burning oil now please!!!!
4172 2018-12-20 17:34:20 Free speech is a right. But you have Saudi, Russian and American monies paying protestors to kill the Canadian energy industry. We have to ask why? Is it because killing Canadian oil production increases prices for their oil? Does Canada tell them what to do in their countries?
4173 2018-12-20 17:34:19 Oh no! That's not awesome to hear. We suggest wiping the area with a soft cloth soaked in vegetable oil. Feel free to send us a DM if you need support!
4174 2018-12-20 17:34:11 if anyone wants to get a broke girl  a Christmas present I need an oil change

4176 2018-12-20 17:33:47 I got artillery no be the one before oil mill
4177 2018-12-20 17:33:45 This snake oil salesman wants to line his pockets with public money that should be spent on improving existing transit infrastructure. No good argument can be made for building a roller coaster for a billionaire. It's infuriating that this is being reported on uncritically.
4178 2018-12-20 17:33:36 Milky Ways pale in comparison to the Bounty (oil issues aside!)

The Milky Way has less taste than a Bounty, so I’ll make sure to finish the coconutty goodness before visitors arrive
4179 2018-12-20 17:33:28 Too many stocks probably although my biggest positions account for a much higher % of total. Very heavy on oils so obvs the 30+% fall in oil price alongside everything else hasn't helped. Probably have 30 stocks.
4180 2018-12-20 17:33:28 Too tight fi go in try oil it up
Pum pum clean and tidy up !!!
4181 2018-12-20 17:33:14 "We foolishly fight for Border Security for other countries."  Good point.   Let Saudi Arabia protect its own oil tankers and bring our U.S. Navy Fifth Fleet home!
4182 2018-12-20 17:33:08 my mom said putting on essential oil would help tho ... but i dont have it , you can try tho noona if you have one

4189 2018-12-20 17:32:17 I can't remember the last time I changed my oil
4190 2018-12-20 17:32:15 Yes the same Isis which is funded by India to wipe out Muslims and to get low priced oil.
4191 2018-12-20 17:32:10 He couldn’t be more wrong, it’s young idiots who never change their own oil on their electric cars
4192 2018-12-20 17:32:09 Government spending is less because the drop of price of oil, on the other hand investment is increasing rapidly + consumption; unemployment is shrinking so I don’t see why the Fed is increasing its IR unless they want to reduce the price level by deflation.
4193 2018-12-20 17:32:04 I had an itchy throat last night and thought I might be getting sick so I rushed home to drink some black seed oil and I swear I feel like a brand new person today.
4194 2018-12-20 17:32:03 McConnell has never put country first. It’s been many years of snake oil. Thank you Kentucky.
4195 2018-12-20 17:31:55 I don’t think we see the same magnitude of negative impact from the oil price decline. Not much recovery in the sector after the price rebound. Seemed to wipe out everyone who couldn’t produce at $30-$40 a barrel.
4196 2018-12-20 17:31:52 Na , thats not main problem , JAS would pay for Galácticos if that was right and reasonable prices, The club can not act as City or PSG which is sponsored by oil countries. I do not think the club would have a problem paying 80-100 for Hazard.

4198 2018-12-20 17:31:51 This Government is not interested in clean energy development unless Trump gets his expensive wall. I do agree with continued R&D in clean energy. We need to reduce our dependence on Carbon Based energy such as oil and coal.

4201 2018-12-20 17:31:43 There is documented proof that oil companies had proof of global warming 40 years ago and swallowed it.
4202 2018-12-20 17:31:36 They will have no choice but to give their oil to Russia and Assad.
4203 2018-12-20 17:31:30 im so happy ive received my cleansing oil, moisturizer WITH FREE GIFT (klairs sample), lipstick and now my eyeshadow palette are otw ehehe also gift for my friend birthday also on its way
4204 2018-12-20 17:31:30 I don't want another American serviceman to die for an ungrateful Islamic nation.  Let the Russian and Chinese have them.  We've got all the oil we need right here.
4205 2018-12-20 17:31:30 What kind of APPRECIATION did you expect donald ? Free oil for all. Or some kind of payment. Or blind loyalty ? Just stay away and let the others take the cherry. China will build trade route over there. So lost is lost.

4207 2018-12-20 17:31:26 Some people are stuck in the 60’s. They are just interested in making as much money as possible and don’t understand there are thousands of variables that go into the price of oil.

4210 2018-12-20 17:31:16 Humbly, I believe we need someone more progressive, who hasn't voted with republicans and oil so often.  Though, maybe that was because of the district he represented.
4211 2018-12-20 17:30:55 HMU to change your oil 25$ but you gotta buy the oil and the filter 
4212 2018-12-20 17:30:52 It would require a change to our constitution and confederation that... wait for it... ALL OTHER PROVINCES WOULD HAVE TO AGREE TO AS WELL. So it’s basically an empty threat being put out by shit disturbers and snake oil salesmen.
4213 2018-12-20 17:30:52 Bullshit 

Elon uses special concrete with hopium crystals and cuts cost in half, and only big oil bros require rebar.

4225 2018-12-20 17:29:39 What are you needing help with? The fella in the truck was at a rally for Alberta Oil. He tied in Sharia law, like the two are correlated.
Our country is divided, and hating various religious groups or races isn't going to help the economy, or country.
4226 2018-12-20 17:29:37 Yikes. That is horrible. Time to really accelerate the move away from oil. #ClimateJustice
4227 2018-12-20 17:29:35 The plant had a big Christmas dinner, all the guys from the oil barge is big miss st. guys . I couldn’t help myself I had to ask them how that Lexington trip went in September #BBN
4228 2018-12-20 17:29:33 
4229 2018-12-20 17:29:21 This you should get unanimous support from Mr. President. Let’s be frank the ONLY two reasons the US has ever been involved in the Middle East are Israel & Oil. Israel can defend itself & the US should become self sufficient on energy. Then time to get out of fighting over dirt!
4230 2018-12-20 17:29:20 Great . Targeting non oil and gas sector is the key to recovery of sound economy, all together all sectors must contribute to overall recovery as per their respective potential.

4232 2018-12-20 17:29:07 What? NOW is the most important thing? Sending other parents’ children to die over oil?  NOT THE DEATH OF OUR DEMOCRACY?  You are sadly mistaken.
4233 2018-12-20 17:28:58 @jidesanwoolu sir, you should visit the people that their shops and houses got burned at Abule Egba/ Awori due to the oil pipelines fire outbreaks that happened earlier this week they really need government intervention.
4234 2018-12-20 17:28:54 My preference is for drinking olive oil
4235 2018-12-20 17:28:47 Proud of you!!  

Also, HOLY SHIT Sears still exists, AND they do oil changes?!?!
4236 2018-12-20 17:28:44 Mike, know your facts. Demand for oil is growing worldwide.
4237 2018-12-20 17:28:34 Scientists, economist, the oil and gas sector, Canadian Chamber of Commerce all have it wrong. Billy boy and the Conservatives are the only ones who have it right. 
4238 2018-12-20 17:28:17 Investment in the oil sands is a serious problem because they are so expensive to extract.  That's why no one is doing it.
4239 2018-12-20 17:28:12 main difference between 19 and 16 is that there is a bit of stimulus still baked in for 19 (lags in gov spending ramp up).   but with falling oil likely to impact oil related investment, similarities are rising
4240 2018-12-20 17:28:12 Then he's an idiot. Petroleum is going the way of whale oil.
4241 2018-12-20 17:28:08 What Canada should do.  1 export all the oil we can. 2. Get rid of carbon tax. 3. Put tax on oil sold, collect as separate line item to create a huge pool of capital. Use this capital to fund renewable energy and electric car purchases etc.
4242 2018-12-20 17:28:03 No Deal by accident is likely if this oil tanker isn't halted soon.  I'd like to know if there's ever been any other Country that has given up favourable trading terms and good relations with neighbours- unless at war?
4243 2018-12-20 17:28:01 It's unfortunate in that it's coming from the same guy who smeared O'Rourke less than a week ago. My gut said "You going after him again? Falsely painting him as taking corp money from the oil companies wasn't enough?"
4244 2018-12-20 17:28:00 Truckers protesting about getting more oil to the rail lines.

I bet you could increase the oil and make it without the egg, but it wouldn't be very good.
4249 2018-12-20 17:27:44 No, dem the facts and no amount of temper tantrums and traffic obstruction will change it.  Also with technology and automation a number of "oil field" jobs are obsolete, no pipeline is going to being them back.
4250 2018-12-20 17:27:39 @younglivingeo is coming out with a CBD oil in  Jan 2019 
4251 2018-12-20 17:27:39 Nice introduction pls do ur best do the right thing and always pray to Almighty Allah to guide you
4252 2018-12-20 17:27:30 Tried to nap while my car's getting an oil change & serpentine belt replaced. It's a no go. Sigh...
4253 2018-12-20 17:27:26 Higher than it's ever been? You're joking, right? The Dow below 23,000 TODAY and the Nasdaq is close to a bear market. US oil prices have dived more than 4% to the lowest level since Aug of 2017. WORST Dec for the market since the Great Depression.
4254 2018-12-20 17:27:19 @realDonaldTrump All this winning. 
Dow sinks below 23,000; Nasdaq flirts with a bear market; Oil in free fall

4255 2018-12-20 17:27:17 Big Oil and big money know this.
And we do too.
4256 2018-12-20 17:27:08 I think what happened is that I did one of the steps right after i got it changed a couple weeks ago, but didn't do the other step. So, maybe it didn't recognize the new oil. I just did all the steps, so that should do the trick.
4257 2018-12-20 17:27:04 When I was 14, my white mom took my to the salon to get my hair done bc she didn’t know what to do w it. The (white) hairdresser told me to put coconut oil on it and then straighten it. I did this & broke off a  ~4 inch piece of hair and was stuck w that till I cut my hair short
4258 2018-12-20 17:26:52 Burning the midnight oil. When will this end =$
4259 2018-12-20 17:26:45 Maybe I was too conservative...in not recommending to conserve the oil longer 
4260 2018-12-20 17:26:29 You are lovely. 
I have thick/ bushy curly hair mix with a mind of its own. I do avoid blow dryers, curling iron, hot rollers, hair spray, gel. I apply taming product (biosilk, coconut oil, etc.) when it's wet/damp and scrunch it with my fingers and hope for the best.
4261 2018-12-20 17:26:17 We are now stocking CBD oil in all of our stores. Excited to see how sales go!
4262 2018-12-20 17:26:14 The only conversation today has been with the U.S. pulling out of Syria, which basically gives control of it to Russia/Iran, what are the #oil implications if any moving forward.
4263 2018-12-20 17:26:06 Osheyyy oil wayyyy
4264 2018-12-20 17:25:59 Maybe back in the 60s but today’s engines are immensely complex. Sure you can do an oil change (which EVs don’t need) but anything else requires special tools that you wouldn’t have unless you worked on cars. Even spark plug changes are impossible these days
4265 2018-12-20 17:25:59 IDK? Venezuela it is the 11th largest  oil producer in the world...what do you think?
4266 2018-12-20 17:25:50 One of Q's greatest strengths is exposing the deep state boot lickers who pretend to be maga, so in that sense, i'd say he's far from snake oil.
4267 2018-12-20 17:25:50 There is no other way of getting your energy than using gravity.
Big Oil or big money can’t stop it from happening.
Money will chose which is cheaper to use.
The people will use the cheaper of the two.
Gravity wins first time. Every time.
Gravity is free. There is nothing cheaper
4268 2018-12-20 17:25:47 The world uses an amount of energy equivalent to that derived from the combustion of 3.5+ cubic miles of oil. 
Have you any idea how many batteries lithium or other it would take to store %1 of this. 
We need to get real.
4269 2018-12-20 17:25:43 See brother you are “troublesome” when I was growing up I learnt a year has 12 months, its only in Nigeria that an extra month mysteriously appeared at the end of the year. And it’s not related to productivity HmmmBetter carry your rice and oil and LIKE IT. 
4270 2018-12-20 17:25:35 Didn't even think of their new owner tbh. But still, FFP will make it tricky for them. If this was a decade ago, maybe they'd have been lucky how City were with their Oil money.

4272 2018-12-20 17:25:24 Safflower oil! I use it on all my clients and they love it! It's great for sensitive skin and doesn't leave you feeling greasy.
4273 2018-12-20 17:25:10 agreed.   change in a sense is that 30-40% of chips aren't reexported -- so $100-120b.    Could see 10% plus fall in those imports.   Plus, well, swings in oil matter for the world's largest oil importer.
4274 2018-12-20 17:25:10 That’s what caravan was all about, battle with Russia over venesualian oil
4275 2018-12-20 17:25:07 Oil prices fell sharply hitting year-lows amid ongoing concerns surrounding oversupply and the outlook for energy demand.
4276 2018-12-20 17:25:02 Sales to who? Lol

Q doesn’t sell anything and we don’t know who he (they) are.

MAGA shirts are on the rise as well.

Trump must be a snake oil merchant too 
4277 2018-12-20 17:24:46 my hypochondria keeps getting worse by the day and my therapist hasnt taken any of my concerns or my inquiries about anxiety meds seriously. so fuck it, im taking this into my own hands. after work im gonna try to stop by a smoke store and get some cbd oil. next best thing
4278 2018-12-20 17:24:40 I feel like at this point it's less changing the oil in the car and more changing the car around the oil, Argo-style.
4279 2018-12-20 17:24:36 my car needs an oil change TODAY

4281 2018-12-20 17:24:18 Burning the midnight oil just to understand whether India "eventually" (dirty word) follows the global way or global markets stabilise soon and go the India way. Should have an answer by next week.
4282 2018-12-20 17:24:17 Oil.
4283 2018-12-20 17:24:00 As his vast labyrinth of cons and crimes is revealed, Trump hands Syria to Poot, lifts sanctions on Manafort’s Russian oligarch banks+oil. Vlad, seeing end is nigh, extracts his favors from puppet in White House now. TRE45ON still hopes for hotel in Moscow, golf course in Siberia
4284 2018-12-20 17:23:52 LOL or brexit, France, Italy, QT, oil, tariffs, rates, high-yield breaking down and the unwind of passive ETF market structure.
4285 2018-12-20 17:23:49 Semyon Bagdasarov:

Bagdasarov said the U.S. withdrawal would leave massive oil reserves in Syria’s Deir ez-Zor province to fall under Russian control

#Trump is giving up oil for Putin. #MAGA applauds
4286 2018-12-20 17:23:43 Where can i get oil for a vapor pen??
4287 2018-12-20 17:23:43 Sauteed zucchini, bell pepper, garlic, onion tomatoes in 1 spoon olive oil... In that order..added a pinch of salt and pepper.. took it off the stove , added pasta to it..didn't soften it too much..made a dressing of olive oil,red wine vinegar, crushed garlic,salt & oregano
4288 2018-12-20 17:23:41 I was at the rally. Yes, I saw some of those signs referring to the un migration deal but a lot of us that took the time to be there to support our Oil and gas industry were there to do just that. Nothing to do with the un migration deal.

4291 2018-12-20 17:23:21 JP Morgan, Bloomberg, Morgan Stanley and many others, all project that prices will settle at roughly the lower $70s. The Saudi’s are estimating $80! Of course the figure of $60 in our budget is an average; we’re not expecting to sell oil at that price daily.
4292 2018-12-20 17:23:20 Royal Dutch Shell “b” fell 27p to 2290p on souring crude sentiment whilst highly geared Premier Oil was off 5.6p to 56.77p.

4295 2018-12-20 17:23:08 Responding to the slump in global crude oil prices, OPEC Secretary General Mohammed Barkindo said the proposed 1.2m barrel cut in production would amount to a 3.02% reduction for OPEC members.
4296 2018-12-20 17:22:59 15,000km before an oil chance? Holy! How have your cars held up, @DarrenDreger? Should be done every 3 months/5,000km. @LeafsLunch1050 @AndiPetrillo @CraigJButton

4301 2018-12-20 17:22:25 Build a wall so they can't get in. Let Mexico conduct their medical exams. Mexico should stopped them at their southern border. Mexico is an oil rich nation, they need to stop saving their money by spending ours.

4308 2018-12-20 17:21:44 The term ‘plant-based’ is more vegan than just being vegan. Being plant based means minimizing oil, salt, and sugar intake as well.

Typically, people who are whole food plant-based have a healthier diet than vegans

4317 2018-12-20 17:20:34 Why must the cookie be human?
"Gingerbread Shapes" is more correct. 
"Animal crackers" are also offensive. 
And don't get me started with "baby oil" cause that's to weird.
4318 2018-12-20 17:20:33 Just as they always have, wars will be fought over resources.  The US is addicted to oil.  Until we're not, we can't afford to back away.  The planet is making the US and OPEC an offer they cannot refuse.  Maybe we should back away as part of a strategic shift.
4319 2018-12-20 17:20:29 Gonna attempt to perform my own oil change on my whip today lol 
4320 2018-12-20 17:20:16 IMF will not agree on lowering oil prices...
4321 2018-12-20 17:20:08 And then there's energy,which is very susceptible to recession. So Im trying to read into whether the selling of the last couple months is related to recession worries, or all about supply etc. I would've thought oil selling like this would've had a bigger affect on the market...
4322 2018-12-20 17:20:04 I’m very excited to use my essential oil diffuser tbh my friends are the best
4323 2018-12-20 17:20:02 Does asserting #1 #oil exporter Saudi is -110 bln bbls reserve than claimed also make natl security case for U.S. to import more & save it's feed stock (certainly not export it)?

4326 2018-12-20 17:19:41 Yet divers in lower mainland complain the loudest about the price of gas. Carbon tax of over 10 cents a litre plus gst charged on carbon tax. Maybe it's government and not oil companies gouging

4330 2018-12-20 17:19:27 I’m not seeing any restraints, vibrators or oil. I’m confused here
4331 2018-12-20 17:19:26 it's reportedly much cheaper to maintain an EV. an internal combustion engine has hundreds of moving parts that constantly need to be replaced. oil changes, spark plugs. EV also much easier on brakes because the motor slows itself down when the accelerator isn't engaged.
4332 2018-12-20 17:19:20 To telegenicly roast oil executives for campaign donations and then post soundbites on Twitter is my guess.
4333 2018-12-20 17:19:17 the quarterly tweet about walking through walmart aimlessly and seemingly endlessly while i wait for my oil change and thinking about why tf im getting my oil changed at walmart

4338 2018-12-20 17:18:54 The last time I let Walmart touch my car was almost 9yrs ago. Because after my oil change they graciously put the left over oil in my trunk; however, they didn’t put the cap on right so it spilled all over. To this day I cannot leave anything in my trunk or it will get ruined.

4344 2018-12-20 17:18:27 @CNNPolitics Trump is Vladimir Putin's answer to hold the world in his hands . Creating Mayhem throughout the planet to show his people they aren't so bad after all tolerating him vampirizing their gas and oil profits to invest in American realestate
4345 2018-12-20 17:18:24 You do not get it... It is NOT our business what happens in oil rich middle east...
4346 2018-12-20 17:18:24 I will not argue that climate change is not an issue. What is an issue is crippling a major source of revenue for all Canadians i.e. oil and gas revenue when Canada is 1.6% of the global contributor to GH gases. No matter what we do, it won't matter globally.
4347 2018-12-20 17:18:22 Meh. Fundamentals don't justify the recent drop in either the oil or natural gas prices. Most likely market manipulation by big players who want to shake weak hands out of the market before the upcoming rebound in 2019. Back to $150 by 2020.
4348 2018-12-20 17:18:21 Ladies and I probably had argan oil to

4350 2018-12-20 17:18:12 there is a lot of argument over who "we" is and should be. should it be those who are investing in oil development - who stand to profit if >2C and lose if <2C? or should it be government?
4351 2018-12-20 17:18:10 Saddam literally paid Syria in Oil so they wouldn’t interfere in his war with Iran. Iran has many advantages in Syria with US pulling out, but new oil reserves really isn’t one of them.

4355 2018-12-20 17:17:44 he may have done more to advance globalism for Canada than he did to protect future Albertans. Now you think Scheer is going to save our country? Forget that.

4358 2018-12-20 17:17:30 We were never there to defend democracy.  We were there to defend the USD-centric system as structured.  If that's breaking down, we should see us increasingly pick up our ball and come home.  We have enough oil at a weak enough USD to transition us to other forms of energy.
4359 2018-12-20 17:17:28 Oil is in a freefall. Our gov officials have been war crying for years.  This is a "conspiracy" not a "correction"
4360 2018-12-20 17:17:25 Someone told me it could stop your heart. I never fucked w butane oil til I became a pen head. Fked with the Select brand heavy.

4376 2018-12-20 17:16:23 Yes coconut oil
4377 2018-12-20 17:16:19 Apparently when they told me it would take 45 minutes to get my oil changed, they really meant 2 hours. Silly me
4378 2018-12-20 17:16:13 Yes and maybe station people on the wall to our hot oil and tar on anyone that tries to climb the wall 
4379 2018-12-20 17:16:05 Hahaha its obvious
4380 2018-12-20 17:15:54 Trudeau doesn’t import a drop of oil. Are you calling for a National Energy Program so government can take full control of the o&g industry?
4381 2018-12-20 17:15:46 Mix 2 cups English muffins with 1/3 cup basil. Add generous amounts of Olive Oil. Fry. Serve on bread
4382 2018-12-20 17:15:43 The problem with @itsmutai is anaanza kitu na objective moja: oil me n I'll keep quiet. Like a wheel
4383 2018-12-20 17:15:42 Trump  handed Syria to Russia. The leviathan gas field will be fracked to Russia, not Qatar.  Syria has always been a Russian asset, the only reason you object is to secure petrol dollar Mediterranean out of Russia’s oil plays. It sure wasn’t @dnc idea to protect the Kurds 


4384 2018-12-20 17:15:39 KOK OIL SIH
4385 2018-12-20 17:15:37 great thread Dan -- I agree it's a very important discussion, but a hard one to have as its so often interpreted as an attack on one side or the other. attacking the oil industry and all the jobs/benefits it provides, or attacking efforts to mitigate climate change
4386 2018-12-20 17:15:29 BRING OUR BOYS HOME AND STOP THIS IGNORANCE!!! We've lost too many of our own for what, oil that we don't need? Threat against the U.S? None of which are relevant nor necessary.
4387 2018-12-20 17:15:26 appreciate the reply!  thoughts on using butter, olive oil, nothing to adhere? Long and slow makes me think much will just run off

4389 2018-12-20 17:15:18 Yes they are oshawa shut because of electric cars. And cost to much to redo the plant to build electric cars . And st Catherine's lost car industry. Our economy is done on fishing farming. And oil isnt the only industry in this country. Oil is a 1.6 billion dollar industry
4390 2018-12-20 17:15:16 WTI oil at $46.66/barrel, -$1.15.
4391 2018-12-20 17:15:12 Bio oil girl!! Literally gets rid of all NEW scars. In my personal experience, it worked after 2 months of daily use, but it works wonders
4392 2018-12-20 17:15:09 BC and Saskatchewan are similar. It’s just that Alberta’s oil n Gas industry is much larger.
4393 2018-12-20 17:14:56 @GregaHorvatFX Did oil bottom here u think? or still see 45?
4394 2018-12-20 17:14:44 NOW will you look at waiting lists, the trolley crisis and cannabis oil??
4395 2018-12-20 17:14:42 not currently accepting new ‘bertans. Remember Canada : if the derricks are a rockin’, it’s safe to come knockin’. If the oil flows slow, y’all gots to go

4397 2018-12-20 17:14:32 He's absolutely arse-high to an aurochs, isn't he! Well, maybe he'll think twice before hungering for man-flesh. If he ever missed an opportunity to coat M'zhet Tia's body in oil, I'd sympathize.
4398 2018-12-20 17:14:27 Now a days lot of people governance issue happening in Genpact like favouritism, internal politics due to that lot of people left the company and this incident adding oil to the fire. Too sad too hear this..may his soul RIP
4399 2018-12-20 17:14:26 Did you know there's a ton of oil under Kurdish sovereign lands?
4400 2018-12-20 17:14:25 Agreed. Have you tried the ones at TJs? For a while I tried baking healthy snacks like Kale chips. FAIL. Sometimes I'll do sweet potato chips in the oven on parchment paper w/out oil.  Also -- when it's chilly, Rooibus tea. Love it.
4401 2018-12-20 17:14:24 Only if your reading about the newest beard oil on the market while eating out of the mug.
4402 2018-12-20 17:14:19 Please stay in U.S. you only fight were it’s benefit you. Oil, finance etc.
4403 2018-12-20 17:14:14 You think they wouldn't of taken the oil fields if Russia didn't have US and British support?

Or the US and Britian fighting them on other fronts?

4405 2018-12-20 17:13:37 We shouldn't have ever been there in the first place. When will human life be more important than oil? I say "Life before oil"!
4406 2018-12-20 17:13:37 You must be a kano man
4407 2018-12-20 17:13:35 @silkdynastystx Buying oil here? Low is in?
4408 2018-12-20 17:13:33 No, it didn’t. What caused the issue was corruption and an economy that was predicated on oil and wasn’t diverse enough. Tell me why you think it was socialism? Why did this happen in the 90’s under a non socialist right wing capitalist government
4409 2018-12-20 17:13:24 The Arabs may find U.S holidays less of a visa issue and more likely a "how much oil have you got?"..scenario!

4416 2018-12-20 17:12:56 ごま油。。。くっそ。
4417 2018-12-20 17:12:49 You think it is Putin's goal for Turkey to annex all of Northern Syria?? Part of US withdrawal included Turkey buying $3.5 billion Patriots instead of Russian S-400 missiles. Sure Putin wants US out, but Assad will lose valuable oil and farmland to Turkey. Hardly a Putin goal.
4418 2018-12-20 17:12:49 Awwww, bless your heart dear, he's a conman. Or to put it in slightly older terms a snake oil salesman. In other words whatever he is selling doesn't exist, or if it does, it doesn't work. He told you all that you were getting a "big powerful wall". You were never getting a wall.
4419 2018-12-20 17:12:46 Because he’s lost his ambition

4424 2018-12-20 17:12:33 Pro tip: rub yourself in body lotion that smells really good or put some lavender oil on your pols/neck and you will sleep like a baby cause you focus on smell. It works everytime with me 
4425 2018-12-20 17:12:32 Well it's not water vapor at all it's oil usually vegetable glycerin. From a personal perspective it sure FELT better than smoking on my lungs.
4426 2018-12-20 17:12:32 @JoeVargas Do you have any samples of CBD oil as I want to try it for my pain but can't afford it as a disabled Veteran....  Merry Christmas...... @WildBil7
4427 2018-12-20 17:12:29 Try coconut oil or child's farm from asda xc
4428 2018-12-20 17:12:15 Sure & I have pointed out what a dumb measure it is since DPR began. Pure industry rah-rah propaganda (paid for by us!) to distract from reality of a marginal tight oil business.
4429 2018-12-20 17:12:13 Overnight last night, Disney ripped apart my bait-covered oil pants. There is nasty ass bait juice ALL over the floor & couch. Pray for me.

4435 2018-12-20 17:11:34 Oh god!! Poor guy! I've heard that cbd helps a good bit plus just the help,oil its self...reiki is amazing too. I helped some clients by using T touch. Kind of antiquated now but certain massage moves coupled w/reiki make a huge difference.What had happened to his toe?
4436 2018-12-20 17:11:32 No other country would take a resource so valuable, so in demand as oil and gas and allow policies that undermine the ability to get it to market, depriving citizens of the prosperity and security it could and should provide.
4437 2018-12-20 17:11:32 No oil companies or Saudi princes have benefited from Ş Zafer's sacrifice. The people who benefitted are the Yezidi slaves freed from Raqqa, the children there who can go to school again, and all of us who had the privilege of serving alongside him.
4438 2018-12-20 17:11:31 The Middle East is a waste of our lives and money. We don't need their oil. They have always been a sea of violent war mongers and dictators.
4439 2018-12-20 17:11:28 A 1994 interview with Fed gov Wayne Angell.  Three great nuggets.

(h/t @davischip94)

1. "The Federal Reserve controls the price of oil more than OPEC does." You could probably do a semester on SuSi monetary economics just unpacking that sentence. I love that he said "more". . .

4444 2018-12-20 17:11:10 I expect it's all Tripe on a toasted Bruchetta smothered in olive oil and spinach now. Everything else seems to be! 
4445 2018-12-20 17:11:05 Pioneer spent $818 million on capital expenditures (CapEx) for additions to oil and gas properties (drilling and completion costs) during Q1 2018, brought on 63 horizontal wells in the Permian, and only added 9,000 barrels per day of oil equivalent over the previous quarter.
4446 2018-12-20 17:11:01 It should be, thankfully, service should sort it out. Though got into trouble from my dad for not checking my oil. As a car girl I know I should do it. Time though   big yay for a clean house

4459 2018-12-20 17:09:27 Haz and I are both off work now for a few days, so tonight's plan is a #ThreeBirdRoast from @AldiUK with roast vegetables as per a @jamieoliver recipe (but goose fat instead of olive oil)  I'm going to be waddling by NYE!
4460 2018-12-20 17:09:20 I’ll acknowledge that the oil shock played a role, at the time, but inflation persisted even after the shock came and went.
4461 2018-12-20 17:09:19 I went to go put air in my tires because the Low Tire Pressure message popped up on my screen like last week. There was a line and I was like F this! Lol. Bout to order this pump I saw on Amazon. I'll wait til tomorrow tho. Also, my oil change soon thing came on a few days ago
4462 2018-12-20 17:09:17 The statement that medicine doesn’t do the hard and effective work of prevention is a lie @DrPChouinard Saying this is used to frighten people away from evidence based medicine and towards snake oil solutions.
4463 2018-12-20 17:09:04 Bruh they really got a steakhouse that does oil changes in the back in Edison.. that’s American ingenuity at its finest.
4464 2018-12-20 17:09:02 Cbd oil is key
4465 2018-12-20 17:08:59 There is nothing called Indian Oil or Indian Gas, they are all the result of foreign discoveries & inventions. We  borrowed the technology at a heavy price & boast of global presence.
4466 2018-12-20 17:08:52 Turkey has been aiding Al nusra and ISIS for like 5 years. Where did ISIS sell its oil? Turkey.  ISIS used Turkish airports to funnel its fightes. ISIS got all it supplies from Turkey. Turkey aided ISIS in counter attacking the Kurds. 

So clearly you dont know wtf you are saying
4467 2018-12-20 17:08:42 I have a stack of orientations and tickets and they’re all the same. 
Just a different oil company name on it. 
I can see how they wanna cover their butts, I’ve worked with some dumb people.

4474 2018-12-20 17:07:57 Hey asshat, policies aren’t driving the slow down. The global price of oil is. The carbon tax is doing great things to our province. And the big five oil companies still paid over $6B in dividends. I guess math is tough

4482 2018-12-20 17:07:04 Postmedia is owned by an American hedge fund and the National Enquirer. They have a mandate to support the oil companies and are actively working to introduce US style Conservatism to Canada. This is propaganda, not news.

4487 2018-12-20 17:06:41 For a long time the brit army have only been any use to the establishment if they are securing oil for the US
4488 2018-12-20 17:06:36 ever tried poker? any statement with a ? you clueless  and a statement without a Q is your book!:-) so you long oil!:-)
4489 2018-12-20 17:06:33 No, that Beto is with big oil.

4491 2018-12-20 17:06:30 sesame oil
4492 2018-12-20 17:06:21 Delicious warm oil 
4493 2018-12-20 17:06:17 I keep using it infinitely, since it needs to be topped off every time, I have this running jar or oil in the fridge. It’s awesome in salad dressing too, because it’s infused with so much flavor.
4494 2018-12-20 17:06:13 Yemen is a humanitarian / political disaster; Pull out of Syria?  Oil glut.  Refugees fleeing ME countries.  What have you done?
4495 2018-12-20 17:05:58 Just a reminder:

Sirota is the guy who, just as Beto showed signs of cutting into Bernie Sanders' fan base, false-lighted FEC donation records to Beto from everyday people working in Texas oil fields, in order to put a false "Big Oil" smear on Beto.
4496 2018-12-20 17:05:51 One cannot reason with the ideology of ignorance & idiocy. It's like negotiating with a snake oil salesmen; no matter what price break u get it ain't gonna address the issue. 
4497 2018-12-20 17:05:28 Votes Republican

4498 2018-12-20 17:05:23 I like me a good washout. Oil price should be signaling a significant global growth slowdown, possibly recession.

4503 2018-12-20 17:05:10 Doing environmental direct action for two years, or working on feeding the poor; then turning around and voting for someone who wants to means test the poor while doing whatever the oil lobby demands is self defeating.
4504 2018-12-20 17:05:09 trump supporters.....i got some questions for you guys re. this stock market and oil prices.  It's all bad.  What promises has your boy kept other than the ones he made to Russia and his own buds who benefited from the tax reform???  I'll wait....
4505 2018-12-20 17:05:07 Hi there, thank you for your patience. Our new Anti-Marks Protection Antiperspirant Technology products feature a new ingredient, a masking oil, which helps shield the appearance of white marks on dark clothes and helps prevent the formation of yellow stains.
4506 2018-12-20 17:05:04 The diesel is a good example of your analysis. Why was it that diesel refused to come down when the price of crude oil came down as low as $28-$30 pb in January 2016?

Cc: @kharyourdey101 @koyegbeke
4507 2018-12-20 17:05:02 How can a population completely ignore history that oil prices fluctuate. We can’t control them. Maybe it would have been wise to get a pipeline built before prices tanked? And save some of that money from the boom?

4511 2018-12-20 17:04:24 Snake Oil
4512 2018-12-20 17:04:21 A lot of the equipment in the convoy was service equipment. Cranes, hydrovac units, floatation trucks. Stuff like that. Very little oil is moved by tanker truck except what is moved from wellsites, batteries, or plants to sales facilities. An export pipeline would help them all.
4513 2018-12-20 17:04:20 We'll just keep the [midnight] oil burning for you #hannukahjokes #latkesinthefridge

4515 2018-12-20 17:04:06 Imma start back doing oil paintings 
4516 2018-12-20 17:04:02 A wall is a wall, steel slats or not. Simply discussing it, rather than Trump's desire to open lands to oil drilling, is preposterous. The votes are not in either chamber to support a wall.
4517 2018-12-20 17:03:59 I just bought some indica oil. 30mg/mL. 
10/10 would recommend for the "mehs"
4518 2018-12-20 17:03:52 I so love conch. I'm heading down to Florida in a couple months for some vitamin D on a beach.  Will track some down but most places ruin the conch by coating it in wheat flour batter then deep frying in canola oil. YUCK!
4519 2018-12-20 17:03:50 He would like that wouldnt he slowly pulling apart Europe country by country and then NATO so he doesn’t have any one to stop them. When the oil and gas have gone they will be coming after us.
4520 2018-12-20 17:03:40 Tonight’s Grilled Flatbread Pizza
Fresh Tomato, Black Olives, Goat Cheese and Garlic Oil “White Pizza…$12.50
4521 2018-12-20 17:03:39 Yup now Canada owns TMX not Alberta and as such every dollar made from it pumping out oil goes to Canada 

Yet no shovels in the ground to expand

How does that help Alberta?
4522 2018-12-20 17:03:35 This is why I called you a simpleton. How can you compare the UK to Venezuela? Venezuela economy is predicated on oil which went through a massive downturn in the cost of oil (per barrel). Venezuela didn’t diversify 1/2
4523 2018-12-20 17:03:30 My ambition is to go set some oil fields on fire, thank you for your support
4524 2018-12-20 17:03:25 @tritangotraders Sigue bajando el Oil, cuidado que esta cerca el 28 de diciembre y quizas las petroleras argentas... no sean inocentes.
4525 2018-12-20 17:03:13 today I woke up and was almost instantly grumpy
so after we took the dogs out, i oil pulled for about 10 minutes. then i made myself some green tea and pulled apart a pomegranate to eat and ate a banana and took my probiotics. 
already feeling better. 
4526 2018-12-20 17:03:10 Aaaahhhhhh! Yep, those 'high yield' oil plays.
4527 2018-12-20 17:03:04 The US has given up on the fuel pipeline in the Middle East and redirected its efforts to the oil in venesualia. 
4528 2018-12-20 17:02:57 If only oil could start to take off higher from here, would be glorious
4529 2018-12-20 17:02:51 A friend of mine wasn’t fully paid for an oil painting in the state of California, it was 1200.  In the state of California grand theft is anything over 700, he made a report to local PD and the person was charged for grand theft lol.
4530 2018-12-20 17:02:45 I'm grateful for trader joe's scallion pancakes, kimchee, a quickly concocted dipping sauce of sesame oil, soy, and chili garlic sauce.

4531 2018-12-20 17:02:44 I came in for a oil change & got my headlights & heat fixed for the freeee

4534 2018-12-20 17:02:27 Well considering most of our oil comes from U.S. not dictators. Oh wait yes we do trump.
4535 2018-12-20 17:02:24 when i had those i doubled up on the coverage with my moisturizer and if you have any type of oil (coconut preferably) add just a drop or two when you moisturize your face. too much will clog your pores.
4536 2018-12-20 17:02:17 Oil your guns, Frenchie. We're coming for you...with facts and truth and plenty more indictments and guilty pleas and prison sentences. And let me ask you this. If this were Obama or Clinton or anyone else doing all the Imbecile is doing, you would have strung them up by now.
4537 2018-12-20 17:02:05 You know when people put oil in their hair before they straighten it? It looks like that
4538 2018-12-20 17:02:03 It appears that @nestle cares as much about this as it does about it’s palm oil use...Still your profits and shareholders are the most important thing eh?
4539 2018-12-20 17:01:57 Tellz Mo #DEJAVU oil wrestling tickets sold out aint it?? #CapacityAlert doe. I'm in there

4540 2018-12-20 17:01:54 Seeing liberals bash Trump for bringing the troops home is peak 2018. I am now 100000% convinced he could cure cancer and people would still hate him. 

Thank you to the president for ending a stupid oil war in the Middle East that has nothing to do with the USA. About time.
4541 2018-12-20 17:01:53 Looking for a recommendation...

Which essential oil is best for getting people to stop talking to you?
4542 2018-12-20 17:01:51 Sad but true man! Once they open you up the air hits it it's all over but the shouting anyways. Get to the west buy 10kg of 2 year old dry shit cheap from a hillman make ur own oil. It's easy as pie. Eat 5g of it daily for 6 months with a DMT nature walk That's what I would do!!!
4543 2018-12-20 17:01:37 Are you serious?  We've been there for almost 30 years securing American "interest" in oil fields.  ...  I guess Syria doesn't have oil.
4544 2018-12-20 17:01:25 2:01
4545 2018-12-20 17:01:19 I know...  impeach trump for not letting out troops unnecessarily in harms way! That's exactly the solution to OUR dominance by oil and gas lobbyists: more war!!!
4546 2018-12-20 17:01:01 Aquaman has fucked more fish than the BP oil spill.
4547 2018-12-20 17:00:55 12/20: Crushed tomato, onion, mozzarella cheese; garnished with garlic olive oil & basil-pine nut parmesan
4548 2018-12-20 17:00:42 Gorgeous oil painting. Your talent is remarkable.
4549 2018-12-20 17:00:36 It would be great if we were using our own oil, instead of letting multinationals export it raw. That’s a decision the oil companies and refineries make, not politicians and consumers. I believe Trudeau Sr. tried but they resisted.

4552 2018-12-20 17:00:25 おーまだ起きてたのかー作業か？無理するなよ？
4553 2018-12-20 17:00:23 ah do you know what type or brand? or any hair oil works
4554 2018-12-20 17:00:18 Our Dry Shampoo won't leave a cast when you follow directions on the bottle. Shake the bottle, then hold 8-12 inches away before spraying your hair section by section. Aim towards the roots, where hair is most oily. Then massage the roots to absorb oil, and brush hair to finish.
4555 2018-12-20 17:00:10 I'm big into oil. I own lots of it and I know what it smells like. It's rich smelling. The smell itself spawns property and mansions.
4556 2018-12-20 17:00:10 Liquidity reversing?! #Bitcoin futures +9.66%?! Imploding #Oil, equities? Market manipulators are that brazen? Ignorant?
4557 2018-12-20 17:00:09 Isn't that roughly the same amount that people in Alaska accepts as oil royalties in return for the destruction of their natural habitat? Interesting what $1,000 can buy.
4558 2018-12-20 17:00:06 Come try #NorthPrairieGold  delicous flavour Nutters Everyday Naturals  from 12-4pm today.  Lauren would love to tell you why our Non-GMO Canola Oil cold pressed is best!  Ask her what her favourite recipe is!
4559 2018-12-20 17:00:00 AS AN HOUR AND color it with oil pastels????
4560 2018-12-20 17:00:00 I almost bought an oil diffuser for my room yesterday but I was like nah i’ll get it later open up my secret santa gift and it’s an oil diffuser!

4562 2018-12-20 16:59:52 Use tea tree oil
4563 2018-12-20 16:59:44 I would add that until Oil stops declining, it's going to be tough for the cyclicals to outperform and for the market to move higher

At the end of the day, it's all the same trade
4564 2018-12-20 16:59:36 Keep in mind NATO has the largest army in the world.  If the EU falls , we are alone in the world with no friends and Russia will move to consolidate its gains in Europe and with Iran will tie up the Middle  East and they will control the oil!
4565 2018-12-20 16:59:33 No sector has been spared from this sell off rout in oil markets has been worse
4566 2018-12-20 16:59:26 Exactly right
If Assad gets his hands on ISIS fighters, will greenbus them to #Idlib to massacre opposition civilans (cf #Suweida) & support false narrative Assad is fighting ISIS when in fact he pays their salaries by trading in oil with them

Assad & ISIS: 2 heads, one monster
4567 2018-12-20 16:59:26 if I go one more day without an oil change I'm gonna spray my load all over the fucking parking lot
4568 2018-12-20 16:59:24 There are four retired teachers in my family all agree he said "stupid woman". As for not antagonising Labour they are the party that hid the McCrone Report from Scots & stole Scottish oil fields. Plus Corbyn believes in independence for every country apart from Scotland!
4569 2018-12-20 16:59:22 I love my country Kool-Aid Corday and there's nothing you can do to change that. Too bad. You can have them all--the Trumps, the Clintons, all the dynasties. You are a pawn and until you realize that you'll always be blaming others for your problems. Oil your guns, who cares!
4570 2018-12-20 16:59:20 I drive too much. Too many oil changes
4571 2018-12-20 16:59:13 They capitulated under oil price crash.
It's what happens when all your eggs are in one basket.
4572 2018-12-20 16:59:12 sana oil hahahaha
4573 2018-12-20 16:59:00 And you’re point?! By leaving the area sacrificing the Kurds to the Turks that will make Israel even more vulnerable... We produce our own oil and gas and should work on alternative forms of energy which we won’t with trump...
4574 2018-12-20 16:58:53 Bears keep clawing away at the price of oil! Wednesday report from the EIA shows a larger than expected increase in both crude stockpiles and distillates, implying an ongoing oversupply. Will $40 be the next destination for WTI prices?
#oil #shale #Commodities #bearish #WTI
4575 2018-12-20 16:58:51 coba rajin pake cleansing oil deh, dipijit2 aja biasa keluar kok komedo nyaa
4576 2018-12-20 16:58:51 How many banks loaned $$ to oil patch names and now find themselves on wrong side with oil near lows. What was collateral?
4577 2018-12-20 16:58:48 What a foolish tweet, nawa oo, some beards sha, lemme reserve my comment.
4578 2018-12-20 16:58:46 It's a messy case with no easy solutions but an important question is how do we resolve this issue to the point where we can start producing oil from this block?
We need the jobs, revenues etc.
4579 2018-12-20 16:58:43 I’m bout to google how to do an oil change I hate going to the shops and waiting
4580 2018-12-20 16:58:43 Crude Oil just hit $45.68, 10 cents above the Sept 2017 low of $45.58...could this be where we find support (I picked up some longs here)? Silky/Maniac Mancini, you bringing your magic to help get Oil off its butt? #CL_F @silkdynastystx @AdamMancini4
4581 2018-12-20 16:58:39 Not only oil... It is major cross asset capitulation, without obvious reasons , man :)
4582 2018-12-20 16:58:38 @bigbluestu42 @MStuart1970 @RosemryS @AmyCronic @DCoreno @ClubSpeaks @Mr_Pinko @StockMonsterUSA @Lastonein66
Russia, Iran, Syria & many others are not happy the US is leaving.  They have tons of oil money.  Go fight your own wars with mercenary's.  The USA has a Wall to build.
4583 2018-12-20 16:58:35 Clearly Putin is calling the shots of the USA, clearly his supporters were hoodwinked with his snake oil salesmanship and shinny objects but today... they are ALL distancing themselves from this weak, compromised and mentally inept  president.  Time to #ImpeachTrumpNow #MAGA
4584 2018-12-20 16:58:35 Hey, I have a bottle of Wild Turkey in my kitchen, too!

...except mine is full of used motor oil. Brother was helping clean up and didn’t realize what it was.
4585 2018-12-20 16:58:31 Trumpites are not smart enough to realize this money will end up in DJT’s pocket or Campaign 2020 Fund, if he survives until then.  He is a snake-oil-salesman.  Did anyone other than his cult think that Mexico would pay for the WALL?  If so, got coastal land in AR to sell you.
4586 2018-12-20 16:58:29 Are we going to take all the oil and natural resources from Syria before we leave? 
4587 2018-12-20 16:58:24 Cdn’s will not accept @JustinTrudeau and @gmbutts putting thousands of workers out of their jobs for the sake of foreign funded anti oil activists. That’s the message Canadian voters will be delivering in October 2019. (Fixed it for you Jerry) #TrudeauMustGo
4588 2018-12-20 16:58:22 ISIS was used as a tool to topple Assad over oil and gas contracts to the EU, between the Sunnis and the Shia. Russia supports the Shia, and the West supports the Sunnis. Now you may proceed to bullshit us. Thank you. Oh and please, don’t start a new war or it’s bye bye 2020 vote
4589 2018-12-20 16:58:13 They will share the oil after all the death
4590 2018-12-20 16:58:10 What will happen when all crude oil, gas and coal is gone from our planet? A new and innovative solution is going to save our world and help STOP climate change, TIDAL ENERGY!
4591 2018-12-20 16:58:04 He also said his polices promoted the oil industry "Say Thank You". Amazing what he takes credit for while being gone 2 and a half years.
4592 2018-12-20 16:57:55 only made them once, then thought I'd try deep frying them..... they explode...much hot oil and screaming ensued
4593 2018-12-20 16:57:52 Well, technically frying on olive oil/butter is less healthy than steaming veggies. And if you eat any prefabricated foods (bologna or cheese or whatever) you don't need to add salt to the things you cook, because chances are you're already overboard...
4594 2018-12-20 16:57:46 Yes sir Fayose I like your doggedness but you need to contribute it to younger parties like #AAC #Omoyele Sowore for president.. it's been long you guyz have been in board kilo shele na Fayose we know all the stealing of crude oil but all these noice what will it do rather decam
4595 2018-12-20 16:57:39 There is no American war on ISIS. There are 2000 American soldiers in Syria being told they’re fighting for our safety but in reality are fighting to secure oil and $ from Saudi Arabia to enrich the global oligarchy.
4596 2018-12-20 16:57:38 If crude oil price,,could rebound and climb back up,
Hopefully good news for Dow Jones move back up..
4597 2018-12-20 16:57:38 It's Sirota's. 

Sirota's the guy who looked at FEC records of Texas oil field workers and gas station employees donating to Beto, and claimed these people were just like oil company CEOs.
4598 2018-12-20 16:57:37 That’s got to be it cause the last pens I was using had little to no butane taste in them, but would still cause the same issue the OG oil pens had where the butane was mad obvious in taste and color.
4599 2018-12-20 16:57:35 So why do we have a United Nations?Are we suppose to guard the oil forever?
4600 2018-12-20 16:57:25 Walmart takes 5 hours just to do an oil change
4601 2018-12-20 16:57:21 I use CBD oil with THC in a nice vape pen  After I had 5 crushed vertebra removed from my spine, the docs put me on morphine. Sent me home from the hospital after 9 weeks on straight up 15mg IR tabs  Three years of terror. I quit that, use oil and

4603 2018-12-20 16:57:11 #Breaking #Syria Kurdish Contras are currently negotiating with the Syrian Army the logidtics of how it will cross the Euphrates and the handover of all the oil fields and refineries.
4604 2018-12-20 16:57:00 One challenge after another if it was already approved by the government it was approved accepting the fact that foreign funds are tying it up because they can just do that is bs Tim we have the most ethical oil in the world and I’m sure you are aware of it .
4605 2018-12-20 16:56:56 Beard Oil that works actually 
4606 2018-12-20 16:56:55 Far too much attention is paid to the vocal, radical fringes on both sides of virtually any issue. Whether it be Albertans screaming about Quebec's intransigence on oil, or Quebecers yelling about the environment, each group represents a radical fringe - not mainstream majority.
4607 2018-12-20 16:56:53 Rosehips oil brand Nowsfood?
4608 2018-12-20 16:56:45 .....but, isn't Texas just ONE BIG HUGE TREMENDOUS INCREDIBLE BEAUTIFUL oil field?
4609 2018-12-20 16:56:43 Any update regarding Oil &Gas explorations ?
4610 2018-12-20 16:56:37 Because Russia wants the spoils of war (oil). Read Ezekiel 38, God tells us ahead of time what will happen (prophecy).
4611 2018-12-20 16:56:29 lidl pizza, kebab sauce & hot chilli oil is just a whole other level
4612 2018-12-20 16:56:27 Trudeau owns 100 % of the mess that Canada is in, Alberta oil and gas, open border policies, debt and deficit out of control, signing away Canadian control of immigration to UN, tariffs on steel etc
4613 2018-12-20 16:56:22 sorry wreck I just now saw this.  Its basically a heating element with a big ole fan in it the basket that cooks the food has holes in it so the air circulates all around the food.  I don't know if it tastes better than items cooked in oil but it is much healthier

4617 2018-12-20 16:56:08 I love the NFL view on marijuana.  You want to take it for "health reasons" then take CBD oil.  That's not what people want...they want to get high.

4619 2018-12-20 16:55:58 Had something new today from a recipe I found in my sister’s Acadian cookbook. “Egg Pancake”. Baked in the oven for 45 min. Quite nice actually! Give it a try, only 4 eggs in the recipe and super easy to make. I used grape seed oil instead of the shortening though.
4620 2018-12-20 16:55:40 Huge difference between Glow and using veg oil to rub your body, Please dears
4621 2018-12-20 16:55:19 Lol! If they only knew back in the early 1900’s like we know now? Because they were so technically advanced like they are today? Vale took it upon themselves for this AER project. This country depends on rocks, trees and oil. Industries have and are still doing their part
4622 2018-12-20 16:55:16 Cmon be strong
4623 2018-12-20 16:55:08 it’s not for border security lol it’s for oil otherwise fyi there are a lot of border disputes in Africa

Prom. anual del costo d/barril de ref: en 2014 $2300, en 2018 $2280
Los productores que tributan IRAE descuentan IVA, y desde marzo los que tributan IMEBA también, todos pagan $ 33 x lt.
4627 2018-12-20 16:54:55 You are in the Middle East to gain access to oil and further the illegal Zionist expansion of Israel. Get the fk out and stop protecting racism

4629 2018-12-20 16:54:49 For your skin use petrol, groundnut oil might not work for you
4630 2018-12-20 16:54:45 Gold doesn't go up when oil goes up, but then goes down when oil goes down. Then the faux objective gold community says muh oil/gold ratio.
4631 2018-12-20 16:54:44 Do you not understand the differential issue? Selling oil for $10 in Alberta when it sells for above $50 on the world market is due to limited egress.
4632 2018-12-20 16:54:42 That sounds like a fair compromise for a portable solution, and the point about oil pipelines is still valid.
4633 2018-12-20 16:54:42 Did yall know thats its 5 Major banks that own all gastions n oil companies
4634 2018-12-20 16:54:41 The photo of the rig worker cracked me up!

4638 2018-12-20 16:54:35 Bruhhh where the fuck is my Tea tree oil !!! 
4639 2018-12-20 16:54:32 Do the population of canada really want to shut down the oil and gas industry ? If so please give me an alternative? Should everyone who lives where we need heat move east or west ? Should the farmers that grow your food stop farming ? Just curious.
4640 2018-12-20 16:54:26 Trumpty Dumpty teetering on top of his wall today. Markets holding on by a thread. Oil down. Stone indictment imminent. Flynn unpatriotic actions exposed. Pentagon unaware of Syria decision. Putin riding high. Whitaker somehow qualified to oversee Mueller. 17 investigations. Whoa
4641 2018-12-20 16:54:25 Would we care about syria if it were not in an oil and religious soaked region of the world? Put syria in africa or se asia and it may make the back pages. I can see both sides although the debate is too long for twitter. The way it trump did it was very short sighted though.
4642 2018-12-20 16:54:23 "Modernity is two things: individualism, and oil."

Of course, this was not in some academic speech or intellectual salon but in the middle of an 4- minute MSNBC cable news interview. cap-and-trade.
4643 2018-12-20 16:54:16 I didn’t even know they made car vent essential oil diffusers. Hell now I want one too! lol
4644 2018-12-20 16:54:14 tea tree oil(just a bit) xx
4645 2018-12-20 16:54:12 And your good because of oil money and breaching ffp
4646 2018-12-20 16:54:07 Lol everyone’s a racist! i never seen that coming. what about france things seem to be going real good over there.... let me guess all racists right? or are that many people angry over oil prices . it’s probably cause they’re tired of getting ass raped by liberal policy’s.
4647 2018-12-20 16:54:05 Wash your hair and oil it afterwards,sir.
4648 2018-12-20 16:54:00 I am in Calgary - aka Canadian oil/ cow town
4649 2018-12-20 16:53:57 Every independent woman has Googled “Can my car explode if I haven’t had my oil changed” at some point
4650 2018-12-20 16:53:53 Abura～en～Age
4651 2018-12-20 16:53:53 The guy who just did my oil change told my I had bomb nails 
4652 2018-12-20 16:53:49 I agree with you. A prosperous Canada is a good thing. Nobody wants hard times for any province. Oil is at the mercy of the free market, price goes up, everyone's happy, price goes down people suffer. To blindly lay blame based on party is disingenuous. We should work together.
4653 2018-12-20 16:53:44 So tell me Demon Donald..Now that you have given Russia the opportunity to control the price of oil and change it from the dollar to his currency..since the Middle East is the riches area in the world in other mineral such as gold, silver, to even opiam for medications when the

4656 2018-12-20 16:53:26 So gas station employees donating to him is a bad thing?

Because that's literally what Sirota's previous hit piece on Beto did: it counted all people who worked in the energy industry as "Big Oil".
4657 2018-12-20 16:53:26 Did you get synthetic oil at first?
4658 2018-12-20 16:53:23 Looks amazing! Your dough could use more olive oil in it I think. Did you take a #CrumbShot ?
4659 2018-12-20 16:53:17 Agreed but players wrong. No sanctions on Iranian oil, Russia drew short straw here. 

They will create a crisis or leave Syria and give ships/troops back to Ukraine then we’ll with allies imo pull back on production. 

That’s my theory on strategy.
4660 2018-12-20 16:53:17 Also curious if cbd oil could help your evenings, can be an odd thing to try out. but might as well experiment
4661 2018-12-20 16:53:12 Need to oil Mother soon. Get all the hard-to-reach places.
4662 2018-12-20 16:53:10 I am an mmj user and see the benefits of it. But it is not magic snake oil. Does not touch some pain. And I'm sick of mmj users using government opioid propaganda- same thing done to them. Don't demonize what allows a person to get out of bed!
4663 2018-12-20 16:53:10 There’s really no tradition quite like taking your car in for a simple oil change and being told you’ve got about $700 worth of shit that needs to be fixed/changed
4664 2018-12-20 16:53:03 He said manufacturing and oil and gas and my inbox went boom.
4665 2018-12-20 16:53:01 Did they run out of targets in banking and oil????
4666 2018-12-20 16:53:01 Owhhh really. Omg. We meet here. I hope u understand about mspo for the future in oil palm industry
4667 2018-12-20 16:52:54 Gen Flynn should hang for changing the B.O.P. which could result in WW III. The Turkey Russian aspect is central to it. It is how we got here, central to WW I, related to WW II. Involves Balkans, Islam, NATO, oil, ABMs, the Cold War. Everything.
4668 2018-12-20 16:52:49 Funny It looks as if you were helping them, I mean flying air cap, bombing SYRIAN POSITIONS, failing to stop the sale of oil.. gummy that!
4669 2018-12-20 16:52:48 @narendramodi Do appeasement politics for 6 months, developmt prgms,tackling corruption.what?it's not the only criteria to get the elctrl mandate -need subsidies,oil/price reductions,loan waivers!India waited for 60 yrs and can wait for 6 mths.3% of Indians pay tax am one of thm.
4670 2018-12-20 16:52:46 How do you walk in for an oil change and leave with a list of fixes for $500? Simple: Be a female.

4672 2018-12-20 16:52:42 I guess one can never go wrong with lemongrass. Haha...I am also looking at Tea Tree. I wonder how Rosemary will actually smell as essential oil.
4673 2018-12-20 16:52:42 Groundnut oil fa, i mean after eating garau garau
4674 2018-12-20 16:52:40 Honestly, would anyone give a shit if we just nuked the entire Middle East??  What exactly would the civilized world be lacking (outside of oil) if they all just disappeared?  3rd century, fucking barbarians.
4675 2018-12-20 16:52:40 I left all my moisturizers at school  someone help! Target doesn’t have the oil brand I love to use 
4676 2018-12-20 16:52:40 Congrats on the oil change Andrea.
4677 2018-12-20 16:52:16 Still waiting to see concrete details of the mid-year budget legislation. When Snyder unveiled it last month, it was $631M. It included more $ for roads, savings, PFAS response, hiring more CPS caseworkers & planning/overseeing oil pipeline tunnel #mileg #LameDuck
4678 2018-12-20 16:51:58 Only the most egotistical erregant people alive believe we can control the climate. One must be a billionaire to be this self absorbed. Man/woman kind is but another of natures gifts and what we produce is as natural as oil is organic. Unless you believe we are aliens.
4679 2018-12-20 16:51:49 Bcuz there’s nothing in the Russia probe, Mueller is just dancing around getting funded for 2 years and Trump is in on the whole thing..this is just all distraction so the mainstream media doesn’t cover oil pipelines built on sacred tribal land, and Flint MI still has dirty water
4680 2018-12-20 16:51:48 ดีอยู่นะ
4681 2018-12-20 16:51:46 I talk shit but I'd be having you super religious mfs in my crib praying over canola oil and pouring that shit everywhere. Only juju we want in this here crib is good juju

....or Cam'ron ex.
4682 2018-12-20 16:51:40 I have seen a piece of land that can be good 4 farming. The land belongs to the state. Now, if I owned the land and the state learned that it had oil, the state would claim it, right? So brethrens n sistrens r u thinking lyk i'm thinking.
4683 2018-12-20 16:51:38 Majority of CDN’s support responsible resource development, hard not to when it’s brought to their attention that the oil differential is costing our economy $80 million $ a day.
4684 2018-12-20 16:51:37 Sudan regime supported by China for oil. Same with R.Congo & DRC. Gabon, is open. South West Africa isn't much trouble.
4685 2018-12-20 16:51:29 The price of Azerbaijan's Azeri LT CIF crude oil put up for sale on the world markets has gone up by $0.8 or 1.02% to $59.2 per barrel, Report informs.
4686 2018-12-20 16:51:27 Remember the « love in » of 1995? When you begged us to stay? Well, we stayed. I would gladly separate if that option was open. The quicker the better. Because it’s quite obvious we will be stuck paying for your oil stupidity in the near future.
4687 2018-12-20 16:51:25 thats 100% not fair, but the oil sector always has booms and busts. Maybe if we had some incentives to diversify our economy (kinda like an our NDP govt) or a way to get companies to become more efficient (kinda like a carbon tax) we wouldnt be in this mess every 15 years or so

他の食用の油脂に比べて酸化されにくく固まりにくい性質を持っている
4691 2018-12-20 16:51:06 We embargoed oil, steel & aluminum, food supplies because the Jap's were sucking up S.Pacific islands, invading China, Burma, French Indo China.
 We were neutral, and sure didn't want this to happen.
The Jap's wanted to eliminate our Pacific fleet, so they could continue on.
4692 2018-12-20 16:51:03 Today is basically my christmas eve, because we're having christmas dinner tomorrow instead on christmas day. So todays plan: peel 3kg of potatoes and parboil them all and somehow get them in the fridge ready for the roasting tomorrow. And i need to infuse some olive oil as well.
4693 2018-12-20 16:51:02 Same thing you guys told us in Iraq. Where is the cost benefit.  The cost has been very high for us in the Middle East without any benefit. We’re pumping enough oil to get out
4694 2018-12-20 16:51:00 Oh this is so ridiculous. A land locked "country" trying to persuade others to allow transportation of "our" oil resources across their land would somehow be better off than we are now? Grab a brain. And journalists, stop giving this crackpot air time. Come on.
4695 2018-12-20 16:50:58 It never went away, but I miss it because it still contains partially hydrogenated oil to achieve its honey-bunchiness.
4696 2018-12-20 16:50:54 Lies!!! Your anti oil always have been
4697 2018-12-20 16:50:48 Oil and gas will never go away. There is nothing wrong with an oil and gas economy. Although prevention and remediation are important to build in up front.
4698 2018-12-20 16:50:41 Oil of sal volatile works well.
4699 2018-12-20 16:50:31 Doing what I do every year around this time: looking at #oil vs. #gold. Fascinating to see how much it moved back toward the historic norm of 15-16. It averaged 24-29 the past few years. Average for this year through a few days ago just under 20. #oott
4700 2018-12-20 16:50:25 @cooper_m midnight Oil only gig of 2019
4701 2018-12-20 16:50:22 every time you respond to any of my tweets, it’s the same sensation of injecting hot cooking oil into my bloodstream.
4702 2018-12-20 16:50:19 I'm trying to change the oil in my car but that shit still hot
4703 2018-12-20 16:50:06 Bio oil coba,kalo itu bekas luka baru ntar lebih cepet ilangnya
4704 2018-12-20 16:50:03 How does beans without palm oil even taste?.. These people should leave me alone abeg
4705 2018-12-20 16:49:53 Neat phrase. Doesn’t change the fact that the infrastructure cannot support the change overnight. EV sales make up 2.3% of sales, largely due to gov’t subsidies in B.C., ON and QB. 
Oil and gas will be needed for EV production, infrastructure and electricity generation.
4706 2018-12-20 16:49:53 Oh yea thats obviously and understandably the main aim. Any battle v Turkey is years away and daddy Putin dependent I reckon. I could see them abandoning Qamishlo too which is why I'm wondering how much oil is there and how exploitable is it short term?
4707 2018-12-20 16:49:51 Someone please connect me with who sells beard oil??
4708 2018-12-20 16:49:50 I am testing it out now. Seems ok for now *touchwood* and the $6.90 for 1x 120ml bottle of essential oil quite a good deal too. I might order more variation for the oils.
4709 2018-12-20 16:49:48 So what happens when pipeline built another mini oil boom so politicians can buy votes with our money get us deeper indent and encourage semi skilled labours there’s no need for a sale tax

4711 2018-12-20 16:49:44 The roughly 15 gaskets/seals that I *should* have had replaced on the V6 Tacoma 50k miles ago (judging by my oil leak) were about $160. Just the parts.  Better’n a payment, I guess.
4712 2018-12-20 16:49:40 That's another aspect of the oil business coming down the pipeline (no pun intended) these guys haven't realized yet.
4713 2018-12-20 16:49:38 Do not confuse with cold press which is the process to extract hemp oil (vegetable oil) from hemp seeds (which could also contain traces of cannabinoids)
4714 2018-12-20 16:49:36 We'll need to figure out how someway if not already, oil is a finite resource, which we WILL run out of.

4717 2018-12-20 16:49:09 Men like John Rockefeller who used his wealth and ingenuity to find new uses for refined oil, moving America away from was candle's towards kerosine lamps. He eventually expanded his uses for oil and his company to employ millions who otherwise had no opportunity in that industry

4721 2018-12-20 16:48:52 I didn’t say everyone was overpaid. It’s just that #Alberta has a totally different economy than the rest of the country. And we have all partaken of oil wealth in the past through the transfer payments the wealthy provinces are forced to pay. I get that.

4724 2018-12-20 16:48:40 I think part of the problem is that butane is the most efficient solvent for extracting THC from the plant material. And there is no way to fully purge all the butane out of the oil no matter what these muthafuckas try to tell you.

4726 2018-12-20 16:48:37 One winter, you wake up,
morning frost glazed over yesterday's dreams,

as windows of ice frame the sky
into a familiar oil painting,

there is a dance
of indifference in you
like beauty has taken hold,

you are a fledgling bird again
cold, but in love with the world.

4727 2018-12-20 16:48:32 There is a reason Gorka isn't in the White House he's a pawn. Q is a snake oil salesman. You are a snake .
4728 2018-12-20 16:48:11 Just at the ridges, not all over :) I don't have a special recipe to be honest, but I find that sunflower oil with a sprinkling of semolina helps to get the right texture.
4729 2018-12-20 16:48:08 Yeah I've tried those too, not the biggest fan haha I like have to wash my scalp because I get build-up if I don't and it'll get itchy. I over produce oil on my scalp or something and my hair is still all dry even after weeks of not washing it. I love dreadlocks! Thank you!

4731 2018-12-20 16:47:36 maybe you can also bless us with holy canola oil for us to see stray kids 
4732 2018-12-20 16:47:32 Really?  Because the only nations complaining about it at this conference were the Americans, The Saudis, and part of the Russian delegation.

I wonder why the world’s 3 biggest oil n gas producers choose to view such things as statistically relevant, while others do not? 
4733 2018-12-20 16:47:22 Well if we are going to be fair and have a true free market then we also need to end:

1: Farm Subsidy
2: Oil Subsidy
3: Ethanol Subsidy
4: Export Subsidy
5: Housing Subsidy

But maybe you are just picking on electric cars cause you get money from fossil fuel special interests 
4734 2018-12-20 16:47:20 Trying to read the shape the olive oil makes when you try to spread it in the pan so see my future for the day
4735 2018-12-20 16:47:17 That they now purportedly claim to own UG.."my oil..ma garden of banana ready to harvest...ma army..."..i submit to us that it was borne out of Selfishness.

4737 2018-12-20 16:47:09 Crisis..!!the burden of debt will not be tolerated and it will need higher price of oil to overcome and to fill the gap..this is now can be seen in #Oman and #Bahrian economy
4738 2018-12-20 16:47:06 Hydraulic, engine, transmission, gear oil, diesel fuel, kerosene mix it all together it don't care.
4739 2018-12-20 16:47:05 The US is spending trillions in the Middle East to protect big business’ access to OIL - NOT to protect people.
4740 2018-12-20 16:47:02 God is so good! Free oil change  thank youuuuu
4741 2018-12-20 16:46:53 My hair was super staticky so I put some sweet almond oil on the ends hoping to tame it. Now I just have greasy flyaways. 
4742 2018-12-20 16:46:47 Oil prices will contract initially but still rise in the 1st Q2019.Chinese demand's stable,OPEC's cutting quota's,Libya/Venezuela not full capacity, + Iran sanctions.Key is USA interest rates..

4745 2018-12-20 16:46:41 Can snake oil be used in popcorn popping instead of corn oil?
4746 2018-12-20 16:46:41 From the nearby highs, the SPX is -14.7%, Russell 2000 is -22.5%, Oil is -39.1%, Copper is -18.0%. It's not just the stock market. All markets are flashing a yellow flag on the economy. Investors clearly not aligned with the Fed's 2.3% growth forecast.
4747 2018-12-20 16:46:40 That feeling of having new brakes, a fresh oil change, everything topped off and checked is one of the low key best feelings.

4751 2018-12-20 16:46:10 The Middle East is nothing more than a quagmire. To be completely honest our only real interest in the ME was oil and we are pretty much oil independent. Let the Russians have it. They’ll  be no more successful than we were. BTW, I didn’t vote for Trump.

4755 2018-12-20 16:45:57 The people who are employed in the private sector and who are so disdainful of 'public sector' employees now want the government(s), federal, provincial, local, to make them public sector employees. Ab oil sector, GM Oshawa. They dont have a problem with being employed by gov now
4756 2018-12-20 16:45:43 I  hope we can stop being drawn into the middle eastern bloodbath. We have our own oil. They have nothing else we need.
4757 2018-12-20 16:45:37 Judas Iscariot complained just the waybyou are complaining when Mary spent expensive oil to anoint the feet of Jesus. 

Which life would've Jesus lived if many people would have opened their hearts like Mary? 
Remember, he did his missions in capernaum but later cursed them why
4758 2018-12-20 16:45:32 Oil change, finished grading and enjoyed brunch with @Mr_Greene_Math so I’d say Winter Break is off to a great start!
4759 2018-12-20 16:45:31 Imagine this: No deal between Trump & China, global recession, and a hawkish Fed. Meanwhile, shale will keep pumping and so will the Russians and Iranians. We might be looking at $25 oil in '19. #oott
4760 2018-12-20 16:45:20 LOL he’s on the wrong path.  Snake oil... hmmmmm.....
4761 2018-12-20 16:45:13 We have already spent enough. Same with Afghanistan.  Our return on investment not good.  With current USA and North American crude length our interest in protecting others oil supply has been reduced. We can still help but we don’t need to go it alone anymore. Others pony up
4762 2018-12-20 16:45:10 You assume, with your deduction, that there is only one snake oil salesman

4769 2018-12-20 16:44:35 ING Bank 1/3: #Canada: A weak third quarter & continued problems in Canada’s oil industry leave the near-term growth outlook shaky, but we don't expect a material  turn for the worse. We still expect positive growth in Oct & a robust manuf sector should help keep growth on track
4770 2018-12-20 16:44:30 Sigh ... I don't have an issue with you as an individual ... I get that you have a job to do, but look at the bigger picture. There absolutely is media blackouts regarding oil spills and those friendly to the environment have been removed from the NEB, back when Harper was PM.
4771 2018-12-20 16:44:27 I am truly not in the position to choose between a bar and a cafe while I wait for my car’s oil change this is a test I’m going to fail
4772 2018-12-20 16:44:23 Didn't know there was oil in Qamishlo...explains why they've hung on for so darn long of course. Having seen #afrin we pretty much now how it'll pan out!

4775 2018-12-20 16:44:20 The brinkmanship has been played into a corner and all he can do is cry and now North Korea has decided they can throw a little oil on the fire failing Trump can’t catch a break he can’t call on his taxes anymore that was a fake give me to corporate America, Stock Market buy back

4778 2018-12-20 16:44:04  nah fam. Rock with one of those oil pens (if you don’t already) for a few months & you gon’ know the exact feelin.
4779 2018-12-20 16:44:03 If your so against big oil then why not boycott. Shut your gas off to your house, quit buying fuel for your vehicles and not use any public transportation. Bet you change your mind in two days.
4780 2018-12-20 16:43:55 The budget presented yesterday by Buhari is simply a budget of "NO HOPE".  Oil price is $56 from $60 benchmark. Opening deficit- $4 per barrel. Production output- 2.3 million barrels per day,  maximum output ever is 1.9 million barrels. Debt service-- N2.14 trn, meanwhile,USA FED
4781 2018-12-20 16:43:48 Yeah right islamic nations have nothing to charm about they neither have intellectual engineers, doctors, mathematicians, scientists etc nor they have any artists like the bollywood and hollywood actors. The most important thing they have is crude oil which is also limited.
4782 2018-12-20 16:43:48 Pam oil is used in many food items across India and is mixed with cooking oils .
This oil is not used in any part of the world for cooking.
Pam oil is responsible for raising trans fats and linked with heart attacks 
Is anybody listening.

4786 2018-12-20 16:42:53 I do have compassion for them.  I've been laid off. I am in Oil and Gas. The way they decided to protest Ottawa wss dumb and Ill conceived. Please tell me how clogging up the Henday will get Ottawa yo move on the pipeline?
4787 2018-12-20 16:42:46 Exactly. SA doesn’t want to kiss off trump stating huge oil cut.  So numbers announced will definitely be lower.  Then quietly they will scale back production more.

4790 2018-12-20 16:42:37 I thought Turkey hated the Kurds. Is that not true? Why would the Kurds sell Turkey oil? Also I thought the US was taking the oil. I can’t get straight answers in the US which is why I follow people in the ME. I need the other side of the story.

4792 2018-12-20 16:42:30 Agreed - the effect of the oil & gas industry right now has trickle down effect on all sorts of industries in Alberta- restaurants/retail/construction etc are all suffering too.
4793 2018-12-20 16:42:10 Russia and China, both are heading towards Mediterranean Sea for their hegemony, and to capture Oil fields
4794 2018-12-20 16:42:02 Except none of that is true. We actually hear about oil spills that happened inside containment. And would you rather have chefs or carpenters running the NEB?
4795 2018-12-20 16:42:02 My barn owner swears that I don’t have PTC and that I only feel the way that I do bc I clean my car too much and with such harsh chemicals so for Christmas she got me an essential oil car kit 
4796 2018-12-20 16:42:01 Oh, Goobernor Huckabee. You need to come to terms with the fact that Trump won the snake oil game. It’s the only Trump-branded product that could ever stay afloat, but he still beat you. This constant oral to anal servitude is beyond pathetic, not to mention revolting.
4797 2018-12-20 16:42:00 It was raining so hard this morning it sounded like a dull roar on the roof of the house. So of course my wife asked me to check the oil in her car.

4800 2018-12-20 16:41:39 How many jobs have you created, @SenSanders ?
I guarantee that's it's been less than zero.
You have always been a taker. A charlatan. A snake oil salesman.
Offering free stuff knowing that you can't deliver then you blame it on the mean Republicans. @Ocasio2018 is the same
4801 2018-12-20 16:41:39 So it seems air superiority can be gained using a cheap drone these days?
I wonder when these organisations will start listening to those in the know when planning counter measures rather than the snake oil merchants? #GatwickDrone
4802 2018-12-20 16:41:39 Why tf is this oil change $80 fuckin dollars wtf
4803 2018-12-20 16:41:30 Who makes no money and remains anonymous. Terrible snake oil salesman.

4807 2018-12-20 16:41:14 of course they did - he was going to abolish the Federal Reserve, smash the CIA into a thousands pieces, after the Bay of Pigs debacle. He also was going to set caps and tax the oil depletion allowance as well. All these things led to his assassination to include leaving Vietnam

4811 2018-12-20 16:40:55 I am so with you here. Also fake news is not portraying Russia & Syria correctly. Russia fosters their economy.  Regardless what people say about Putin, he cares about his citizenry. Syria has been a main oil hub for Russia for decades. Fake news is also only partial truth.

Big Oil, Koch brothers, Legacy Auto, Trump, Shorters, some media etc etc , all have their reasons to hate Musk.

4817 2018-12-20 16:40:34 Says the woman who is literally paid by the oil and gas industry to say these “good things” in her role as executive director of the West Virginia Oil & Natural Gas Association.
4818 2018-12-20 16:40:19 $70 FOR CBD OIL??????? WTFUCK?????
4819 2018-12-20 16:40:16 Putin knows Trump is about done and would rather have a build up of Russian troops there. After control of Crimea, Suez will be next for Russia. Stranglehold on Europe with oil and gas.
4820 2018-12-20 16:40:10 Shareholder resolutions on 2 degrees scenarios and methane leakage have been presented to many US independent oil companies
4821 2018-12-20 16:40:08 Proverbs 5:3-5

Her feet go down into death, and her steps go in as far as hell.

4825 2018-12-20 16:40:02 Nothing dodgy there, just oil money greasing up some hands
4826 2018-12-20 16:39:49 Don't forget that the entire reason behind the Syria war was to force Assad into agreeing to a US Big Oil plan to run a pipeline from UAE to Europe via Syria. Assad said NO. They didn't like that idea. All of a sudden ISIS appeared and Assad became a monster. Obama supported that
4827 2018-12-20 16:39:46 tas hinabol ko pa bus tas simula junction hanggang fil oil naka tayo lang ako sa bus

4829 2018-12-20 16:39:27 Sirota is anti-gas/oil industry. He constantly attacks Hickenlooper(D) for it. Sirota is just an extreme left Democrat trying to pull Democrats further to left.
4830 2018-12-20 16:39:25 Yes, I'm sure that's the way it is ... that's why there are media blackouts on oil spills, and that's why Harper loaded the NEB with oil executives.  Tell me another bedtime story, please.
4831 2018-12-20 16:39:15 my full sympathy for those who hv to make do with ghar vada, car n oil while other comrades are doling in arabs
4832 2018-12-20 16:39:13 Putin lost a big ally (Iran) that would’ve before helped them but since Trump gave waivers essentially no sanctions on Iranian oil they’re not going to help them. Russia drew short straw on this one. 

Keep an eye on Russia imo.
4833 2018-12-20 16:39:08 Fox person you have no clue of Syrian society in Syria, the 30% the US occupies are dessert regions that are covered in Oil and where none of the Syrian pop lives. Syrians that live in Homs, Tartus, Jableh, Latakia, Hama, Damascus, Aleppo, Swedai abt 18 milln of us want US 2GTFO
4834 2018-12-20 16:39:05 Trump is owned by Russia. Putin’s Puppet. Now Russia is that much closer to there oil domination plan. I hope Trump can’t escape to Russia 
4835 2018-12-20 16:38:58 I started doing the oil wash with castor oil and my skin got SO inflammed. It took frankly accupuncture to calm my skin down, but I think I was going thru a hormonal moment.
4836 2018-12-20 16:38:46 If only we had oil, gas and wind turbines...
4837 2018-12-20 16:38:45 These persons been bombed deserted Syria so Putin wants the oil fields and Trump just gave them to him...why?
4838 2018-12-20 16:38:41 Marco- Neocon foreign policy, whether practiced by Kerry and Obama, or George Bush and McCain, is failed foreign policy. Oil pipes through Syria are not in the strategic interest of U.S. citizens. Isis is ideology not territory. Economic leverage is going to beat Iran.
4839 2018-12-20 16:38:38 Buying the pipeline has done nothing to actually build it and the bailout helps no one as the core issue is land locked oil selling for 20% market value.
4840 2018-12-20 16:38:34 あと10日程で一ヶ月ですからね 頑張ります
4841 2018-12-20 16:38:33 However, my understanding is that Alberta heavy oil would trade at a discount anyway because it's poorer quality oil.  I presume this means it's either more expensive to refine, or it can't be refined into as many products.
4842 2018-12-20 16:38:17 Dear Sir, Indian companies are still not allowed to do cargo measurement surveys for imported crude oil, only multinational foreign companies are allowed to do so, why can't IOCL, BPCL and HPCL allow Indian companies to do the cargo surveys, only MRPL allows Indian companies.

4845 2018-12-20 16:37:59 If I've got nothing to be grateful for, I'm grateful to GOD for covering my shame, most times we eat boiled yam and palm oil and still be referred to fresh and healthy.
4846 2018-12-20 16:37:58 @realDonaldTrump If Russia and Iran fill vacuum in Middle E, they'll probably take Saudi A, Iraq, etc. They will end up N another war N Afghanistan like before. The one they didn't win. Depleting their resources like B4. We don't need Saudi Arabia for oil anymore. We produce more
4847 2018-12-20 16:37:49 I oil you pundai
4848 2018-12-20 16:37:48 I would love a high speed train to Saskatoon, Edmonton, Calgary and even Thunder Bay. Maybe we could build really big oil pipeline and then convert then when the price of oil bottoms out. (only half joking)
4849 2018-12-20 16:37:47 Aaaand we're back to regularly scheduled programming in oil markets --  WTI now down 5 pct to $45.67 a barrel (YEAH), the lowest since August 2017
4850 2018-12-20 16:37:44 So what do you suggest? Shut down the tar sands and import shale oil from the USA ? Or do we build more power plants and go electric? Or burn the Forsts to heat our homes ?  Maybe the carbon tax should help with carbon technology and collection ?

4861 2018-12-20 16:37:22 It has to be less frustrating when Albertan's realize that there is a landslide of support for Canadian oil among Canadians (even where its supposedly controversial: QC 66% and BC 58%).
As usual, Canadians support each other, and Canadian governments can get out of the way.
4862 2018-12-20 16:37:20 yes, but there are also angel systems, like ecosystems. what makes oil companies and facebook bad is not Koch and Zuckerberg. what makes them bad is their emergent properties. being bigger than your market is bad, because then you grow into government. toxic products are bad.

4866 2018-12-20 16:37:01 Aaaaaaa I found a place that sells rosehip oil but it’s so pricey. Should’ve bought it back when I was in Nz 
4867 2018-12-20 16:36:51 Coal socializes costs, privatizes benefits. According to Muller et al., coal and oil fired electricity deliver negative value added to the economy. Which means we should shut down coal plants with all due haste everywhere and never build another one.
4868 2018-12-20 16:36:50 Wait, isn’t everybody afraid that if we don’t contain terrorists in the Middle East they will attack Americans? Are you telling me sending troops to the Middle East was really all about protecting American oil interests and had nothing to do with security? I’m shocked!

4876 2018-12-20 16:36:00 It's nice to have a day where the big dawgs of the gold stocks are moving higher.  Oil is certainly cheap enough.
4877 2018-12-20 16:35:55 3-5 minutes, the oil mixture should be good to go. Check a bit on your fingers to make sure it’s not too hot. Apply directly to scalp, massage it in. Work your way to the ends. Sit with a plastic cap on your head for at least an hour. Wash it out. All done!
4878 2018-12-20 16:35:54 Au contraire mon ami. 

Am delighted to learn Quebecers poll strong support for Alberta oil.  In a poll taken after Trudeau's remarks but seeminglyreleased contemporaneously with those of Q's Environment Minister

I'm calling you on the bull that Trudeau is intentionally divisive

4880 2018-12-20 16:35:43 The lower oil prices were dictated by opec to kill the competition . They always shook the tree from time to time . They must’ve learned from best traders on ws .

4887 2018-12-20 16:35:28 Start checking the labels for palm oil. You’ll be surprised how many products contain it and unfortunately very unethically sourced.
4888 2018-12-20 16:35:10 "Does the USA want to be the Policeman of the Middle East?"  Good point.  Let Saudi Arabia protect its own oil tankers and bring our U.S. Navy Fifth Fleet home!

4901 2018-12-20 16:34:19 Motor oil
4902 2018-12-20 16:34:08 You are wrong stupid guy. Iraqi oil is being extracted by international oil companies including Russian,Chinese, British,American in commercial contracts at which the companies receive few dollars for each barrel of oil they extract the big revenues go to Iraq ministry of finance
4903 2018-12-20 16:34:06 Well the average cost is over 5000/ kW, and the price for natural gas is 650/kW. Developing countries that can't afford that cost should use natural gas if available because it is 40-60 less co2 than coal and oil based.

4906 2018-12-20 16:33:48 Gonna do a rub before bed too Eucalyptus oil and coconut oil, should help. I’ll add them ingredients to my pepper soup tomorrow
4907 2018-12-20 16:33:45 You seem to have missed oil usage continues to increase recently going to over 100m bpd. whatever you do never let facts get in your way
4908 2018-12-20 16:33:43 2019 I’m learning to change my own oil.
4909 2018-12-20 16:33:42 Coconut oil
4910 2018-12-20 16:33:42 Definitely recommend trying cbd oil for pets! It's really effective for anxiety and stress for dogs!! Good luck!! 
4911 2018-12-20 16:33:39 OTD in 1987 Ferry collides with oil tanker near Manila
4912 2018-12-20 16:33:32 Grace thinks she slick using my secret hair growth oil 
4913 2018-12-20 16:33:23 Wish I had eucalyptus oil to handle this headache and all my aches and pains as gently as it always does! 
4914 2018-12-20 16:33:23 #Oil is down 3% at this time. This is crucial time for OPEC+, if they act with more cut this will leave door for losing control over stability function on the long run, if they don't we probably will see more tough days. Hard to predict next action.
4915 2018-12-20 16:33:21 Yup. It's digital snake oil.
4916 2018-12-20 16:33:17 There’s a fanatical community of people who love them that has a bizarre venn diagram with essential oil/leggings MLMs, paleo/keto bros, doomsday preppers, and Mormon moms.
4917 2018-12-20 16:33:17 RIP to that oil pen that sweet soul lost in a Boscovs vest looking her boscovs best. She’s suppose to come back today, I hope she brings me a little treat
4918 2018-12-20 16:33:17 Body oil wrestling at DejaVu? Lmao
4919 2018-12-20 16:33:14 When oil was above $100 dollars,  did the last administration saved a dime?  Spending like a thief, CBN governor was shouting then.
4920 2018-12-20 16:33:10 The pullout from Syria story is going going gone fast. 

Russia will soon see to that. Low oil imo is going to force Putin to leave Syria and also give Ukrainian ships and troops back. 

Or they will create a big major crisis and try to drive oil back up.
4921 2018-12-20 16:33:10 Going with the snake oil merchant team!! WWG1WGA. You are missing out....
4922 2018-12-20 16:33:03 We will never be able to kill the ISIS ideology until we make oil worthless. Our only real allies in that region is Israel. The rest of the middle east are barbarians who will never really be our allies.
4923 2018-12-20 16:32:56 Crush mantika..
Crush in oil.
4924 2018-12-20 16:32:56 Soon u will take that picture on  rusted Yugo!!!!!!  Thanks trump for MAGA except for Oil states.

4927 2018-12-20 16:32:43 @SALAHUD27602174 Oil and Fleet 
4928 2018-12-20 16:32:42 That can only be the result of greater efficiency, which is often through better technology.  And this is the case, Oil production hasn't declined, despite the low oil prices because the cost of production has declined significantly.
4929 2018-12-20 16:32:41 #oil Falling Pretty fast,
I’m long if it touches the $44.90-45.0 range,
#WTi
4930 2018-12-20 16:32:36 Oil $54 and Apple $159. Maybe there’s a hole at the bottom
4931 2018-12-20 16:32:36 I was determined to only get my oil changed—and I did but not without switching to a different type of oil $10 more than my usual. 
4932 2018-12-20 16:32:35 Mmhhh beer.. I’ve been craving Beavertown neck oil all day.

4934 2018-12-20 16:32:34 I was horrified to read a story recently of women writing fan mail, declaring their love for Chris Watts, who’s jailed for murdering his toddler daughters, dumping them in oil tanks and burying his pregnant wife’s body in a shallow grave. I despair.
4935 2018-12-20 16:32:34 Just got my it’s first oil change...me and the housemobile have been through a lot over these 4 years
4936 2018-12-20 16:32:23 This is great with our troops finally coming home.  We should NEVER been involved in the middle East.  This Syria BS is all about oil.
Enough of our troops have died needlessly over the greed of elites
@realDonaldTrump is #BestPresidentEver
4937 2018-12-20 16:32:22 Yeah maybe drinking it regularly will help.  Dont really know for sure but also heard coconut water and oil can help with stuff like that. Couldnt hurt to try. I used the coconut oil for a yeast infection and it got rid of it over night. But not sure for uti...maybe
4938 2018-12-20 16:31:56 Cashel Valley in Olive Oil!
4939 2018-12-20 16:31:52 No shit. There are people too sophisticated to listen to a snake oil salesman. Can you imagine that?
4940 2018-12-20 16:31:43 Exfoliating my lips with sugar and olive oil then applying Vaseline or burtsbee works for me. Although everytime I get free chapstick, those are always the best chapstick that work best for me lol
4941 2018-12-20 16:31:43 Nice, hope that calms him down.
You should definitely try cbd oil for pets, it's really effective for anxiety and stress for dogs!!
Best of health!! 
4942 2018-12-20 16:31:41 Oil is absolutely plummeting
4943 2018-12-20 16:31:40 Not all but I think more weakness is likely. Oil price drop & rally in 10yr should provide some offset for the consumer. I just think Powell is unestimating the impact of QT as well as the hikes to date. Less hikes next year really doesn't matter when economy is weakening now.

Oil Prices 2 go down?
4945 2018-12-20 16:31:28 3) what innovation comes out of socialist countries? No cars, computers, cell phones. Only oil and Venezuela banked everything on oil and the price collapsed and so did their economy. 1m% inflation. They can’t generate wealth they just print money. I’ll check the other countries.
4946 2018-12-20 16:31:14 In any event, I've been talking about global market figures, which doesn't rule out what you're saying. (And by the way, US shale oil has been the really big factor in what I've been describing here-how far ahead of estimates unconventional oil has been.)
4947 2018-12-20 16:31:09 Try castor oil, hair oil, however you and your family.
4948 2018-12-20 16:31:08 People talk about oil field lingo being as filthy as sailors, but you should try being in a rock band
4949 2018-12-20 16:31:07 For one thing it's not going to be economically viable, even with the eastern oil fields. West is not going to pay for rebuilding. They are dreaming to expect it. Sad to say but Syria may never recover the v modest prewar prosperity, esp as oil itself winds down.
4950 2018-12-20 16:31:05 Climate change hinges on burning oil in a clean way. Oil is energy the good lord put it on earth to burn. As it not a water treatment product. Nor is it a fertilizer. It will make its way to surface weight differential will prevail
4951 2018-12-20 16:30:58 ISIS still has 14,000 to 18,000 troops in Syria. We didn’t win, we’re giving Syria to Putin. He will level Syria and take it and its oil.

4954 2018-12-20 16:30:54 Ok lets pretend this entire middle east situation has nothing to do with oil interests and big pharma. lets not forget without US support of rebels NONE of this would be happening. The US supported another regime change that did not pan out. Trump is upholding a campaign promise.

4956 2018-12-20 16:30:53 A super snapper for oil today could put a short term low in place
4957 2018-12-20 16:30:53 Trump handing over control of the Oil reserves to Putin and his Oligarchs is a price I bet he didn't expect to pay just for a few million votes and a golden shower sex video and $millions in bribes since he realised he was on the Putin hook. #Putin #TrumpRussia #TrumpCrimesMatter
4958 2018-12-20 16:30:49 Please, bots of twitter...send those DMs of shitty rap and CBD oil purchasing I so crave.

4962 2018-12-20 16:30:29 Thank you for asking about the points I brought up. There is no political will to get pipelines built I suspect because of our willingness to buy Saudi oil
4963 2018-12-20 16:30:19 My dad (in true dad style) bought this large industrial sized cooking oil that I break my back for carrying from the lower shelf to the stovetop  
My perfect prank Xmas gift to him would be a small oil dispenser.
4964 2018-12-20 16:30:11 Once all the oil is through the pipe.
4965 2018-12-20 16:30:01 Why didn't they vote Indy? Threats of not being in the EU, threats and lies about Oil knowing full well the biggest oil find was offshore lies to pensioners about pensions  threats of job losses , but hey you go and vote for 80,000 job losses in Scotland Brexit wow just Wow !
4966 2018-12-20 16:30:01 Earthley, b.k.a. Plaguely, needs to be investigated & shut down by the FDA. It's dangerous snake oil, with medical claims, NO scientific testing, unsanitary production conditions, deliberately not measured, ingredients contraindicated for conditions they're advertised for.
4967 2018-12-20 16:30:00 YUNG OIL SA MUKHA KO PWEDE NA PANG GAS MULA SAMIN HANGGANG INYO HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA LOVE U TOO BABE!!! THANK YOU SO SO SO MUCH! 
4968 2018-12-20 16:29:53 The weather I can handle. Its all the adulting that gets me. I need to go grocery shopping, change the oil in my truck, buy another pallet of wood pellets for my pellet stove, go to the various family Christmas events and I got my winter tax bill today.
4969 2018-12-20 16:29:53 In relation to #OPEC disclosing individual #oil cut targets, Sam Margolin at Wolfe Research is spot on: "Granularity around cut requirements probably will not be supportive of the oil price, since the issue is not a lack of detail, but skepticism around adhering to cuts" | #OOTT
4970 2018-12-20 16:29:52 Oil prices started Rising drastically around 2005 & more than doubled within a few years.  Driving habits could be part of it.

4972 2018-12-20 16:29:25 This guy doesn't have a clue, so you are going to take $2B out of the NB coffers, brilliant. Oil, oil, oil...that's all this dolt thinks about. #notmypremier
4973 2018-12-20 16:29:23 Well, apart from the oil & gas used by the OEM, the Tesla parts & materials moulding & construction, the supply chain & logistics for auto delivery, and very likely the powergen fuel used to generate the electricity. But other than that - hell yeah #Tesla!
4974 2018-12-20 16:29:19 Poor Brown people with oil normally gets things moving.
4975 2018-12-20 16:29:08 It was the Syrian army in conjunction with Russia, Hezbollah and Iran which ripped ISIL apart. Not the US.

Under US watch, ISIL had more than 4,000 oil tankers stealing oil.

3 months of Russian bombing and it was gone.

The US there was/is an enabler of ISIS!

Good Riddance!
4976 2018-12-20 16:28:54 自分の見る限りカサイも反省しておおよそ15以上出すようになったと思ってたら割を食ってる人も居たんですね
4977 2018-12-20 16:28:54 Find castor or jojoba, I highly recommend the two. And olive oil! That’s the one common ingredient. 

Mix the oils and heat them — some heat the oil mixture in the microwave. Others put the oil mixture in a mini bottle, place the bottle in a bowl of heated water. After about 2/
4978 2018-12-20 16:28:48 It's not just oil, gas and coal. Electric cars and tech use a *lot* of copper. That still has to be mined. There's also aluminium and plastics which are made from oil. This isn't the end of needing natural resources although I suspect which resources we need most will change.
4979 2018-12-20 16:28:46 I haven't tried it with anything else, but I don't see why it wouldn't. You can do the kale ahead of time too, like if you meal prep or something. You don't need much oil, either; about 1T oil + pinch salt for 12oz or so
4980 2018-12-20 16:28:36 Ya'll ever get super annoyed cause you tell yourself everyday to check the oil in your pickup and every morning and it never happens?? Cause same.
4981 2018-12-20 16:28:35 Agreed. A lot is derived off of Oil prices and the rate of change of that price. It really was a big screw up IMO.
4982 2018-12-20 16:28:35 I fully expect sub 2.00 when I fill up Friday oil down 30 bucks in a month
4983 2018-12-20 16:28:34 Entertaining...do you find death war espionage and taking Syria's oil entertaining?
4984 2018-12-20 16:28:27 Thanks! A simple way I like to add texture to stuff is to set a textured background as an overlay layer in photoshop. Could be stuff like watercolor, oil paint, or rolled ink. It's fun to test what each one looks like
4985 2018-12-20 16:28:25 STOP using coconut oil in "healthy" recipes. Coconut oil is NOT healthy to be consumed regularly it is extremely rich with HIGHLY saturated fatty acids. Use it for your hair, skin, nails 7ayalla but do not use it in food.
4986 2018-12-20 16:28:22 Oil off a cliff
4987 2018-12-20 16:28:21 I love the fact that our men are coming home. We’re not even fighting against a country. Fighting against an ideology was a lost cause from the jump! The ONLY reason the US has interest in this region is for oil & not for the betterment of those Muslims ppl that aren’t radical
4988 2018-12-20 16:28:19 You know what the Solution to the Kurds is make them NATO allies!That would force the Turks from killing them off and stealing their oil!
4989 2018-12-20 16:28:09 Charging $32,000 for a motht of medical grade CBD oil is class warfare

4994 2018-12-20 16:27:47 sometimes the demons are real, but they are usually not human. they deserve demon designation when they exploit their support system without giving back. a good example is oil companies. blaming the CEOs is counterproductive, because CEOs have little control over their companies.

4997 2018-12-20 16:27:23 Putin ordered TrumPutin to pull out of Syria, now Assad, MBS & The Rus Bear with the Iron Claw, Gog Magog can takeover all the way to Yemen. OIL World Rule from the Kremlin, Thanks to Flynn, Manafort, Carter, Kushner, Stone, Cohen, Tillerson ...
4998 2018-12-20 16:27:19 If your concept of "an amazing job" is repeatedly attacking the gov't without offering viable alternatives, or if refusal to distance himself & the #CPC from white nationalists & racists is "amazing",  or if you think oil is the only thing that matters in Canada. #Dud #cdnpoli
4999 2018-12-20 16:27:14 So are UK GOV lying when they state that they take 92% of scots oil revenues based on population?
Are the UK GOV LIARS?

5007 2018-12-20 16:26:18 Afternoon Richard this is ridiculous what with trophy hunting,Our raptors being wiped out on grouse moors,the deforestation of the orangutans forests for palm oil and now this what chance does our wildlife have? Is the human race deliberately trying to destroy nature’s beauty .

5009 2018-12-20 16:26:05 Oh yeah girl, I have some cbd oil I take by the mouth because it settle my anxiety and panic attacks. I stay away from THC, for whatever reason I just can’t take it. No matter what strand I try to use.
5010 2018-12-20 16:26:01 Good to see the IRD is following me. Nothing like using Big Oil and Chemical money to destroy anything - even another denomination- that might impede those interests in Washington. Hey Mark, how much money have you spent to destroy the UMC #IRDiswatching
5011 2018-12-20 16:26:00 #FreedomCaucus & Russia have a lot of the same views that'll bankrupt the US--suck US coffers dry by eliminating tax revenues, throw money away on private prisons, oil subsidies, and a big wall just to "save" us from poor people wanting to pick our vegetables and mow our lawns.
5012 2018-12-20 16:25:59 some real wackos out there.   buy the snake oil (at double the asking price) & when it doesn't work they seek validation through legitimate institutions;  dreams of exposing all the nefarious groups acting in concert to prevent her from saying "merry christmas" will be dashed
5013 2018-12-20 16:25:55 use dr bronners (almond or mint) or now Shea mouisture Jamaican black castor or baobab and tea tree bc both are clarifying. no conditioner to prevent build up. oil occasionally with whatever oil I have, so apricot, grape seed or jojoba oil

5015 2018-12-20 16:25:24 #TruthIs Canada has been doing business w/ Saudi Arabia for decades. Hastily backing out of contracts will cost us a pretty penny.

5016 2018-12-20 16:25:23 It's called entitlement.  It exists because Alberta political parties are telling the people they are owed oil patch jobs. There are elections coming, and both Ms Notley and Mr Trudeau are trying to get reelected without implementing #ProportionalRepresenation.

5019 2018-12-20 16:25:03 so far, I’ve seen people do it after a shampoo + conditioner and others who do hot oil treatments as a part of their “pre-poo” routine. Both give the same results. 

You’ll need three oils minimum. I have yet to see a video where anyone uses the same exact oils. If you can 1/

5030 2018-12-20 16:24:40 Oh do one, with your vile fake bullshit. If you had taken the time to read my profile you would see I am an anti-theist and as such I think every flavour of the religion industry is bullshit, equally. Sell your snake oil elsewhere. Shoo
5031 2018-12-20 16:24:35 5.5 hours, including my lunch break, until 6 days off

TO DO LIST;
-buy 1 xmas gift
-get headlight replaced
-get oil change at same time I guess
-clean my room because i've been sick for so fucking long is just been a disaster
-video games
-xmas
5032 2018-12-20 16:24:31 The truth that I don’t need a new air filter and I’m completely okay with the regular oil. 
5033 2018-12-20 16:24:20 Boil pasta, and then drain the water off.
Prepare dressing wid olive oil, lemon juice, sugar, garlic powder etc.

Add tomatoes bell peppers..

Mix pasta with the dressing.

Refrigerate n serve.
5034 2018-12-20 16:24:15 We want the oil.
Oil.
Oil.
Oil.
Blood for money.
5035 2018-12-20 16:24:05 my skincare is chicken oil
5036 2018-12-20 16:24:04 That was $20 off my oil change
5037 2018-12-20 16:24:02 いーくー！
5038 2018-12-20 16:23:41 It was the first one I had participated in, and felt just right. In under an hour, two Christmas carols, two hymns, responsive readings, candle lighting, Scripture readings and a reflection piece. After, the pastor met with people for prayer and anointing with oil for healing.
5039 2018-12-20 16:23:32 He must be selling snake oil somewhere today.
5040 2018-12-20 16:23:28 Be careful w those cannabis vape pens. After about six months of roughly a gram of oil per week I developed some sort of wind pipe irritation related heartburn. Shit went away pretty quick after I stopped penning my reefer but still- be safe.
5041 2018-12-20 16:23:16 The figures cited above suggested 11 million barrels a day by 2025. We're already near that now (10 million-plus), between the U.S. and Canada-in spite of far lower conventional oil prices than anticipated.
5042 2018-12-20 16:23:14 Dawn definitely still getting that marketing money off that though

those duck in the oil commercials still going strong
5043 2018-12-20 16:23:08 So win the instability in the middle east starts affecting oil production again, what will your tune be?
5044 2018-12-20 16:23:02 There is oil in 'soil'. It's called japani tel
5045 2018-12-20 16:22:58 Really? Where are your face based numbers on this being a lie? When Alberta can not get our resources to tidewater they are sold at a substantial discount to the States. Pipelines open up world markets and world pricing for it's oil.
5046 2018-12-20 16:22:55 Larger than life oil portraits.
5047 2018-12-20 16:22:51 I get it. Oil n military ties.. but I'm like no one else had a military? or simply thought to build on their own since that how America was coming... on some bully shit. Over history no one had learned to strengthen their armed forces?
5048 2018-12-20 16:22:49 I understood anxiety, I didn’t understand the panic attack. It was pretty terrifying. The first time, I was convinced the plane was going down. The 2nd time I was convinced I couldn’t breathe. I should’ve dosed with CBD oil.
5049 2018-12-20 16:22:48 えらい あたたかいね
電気とは違うお湯のあたたかみっていいですよね
あぶらさんもこんどごはんしようね…
5050 2018-12-20 16:22:46 277 billion dollars were wasted and stolen in the last 5 years by the centralized government. ,leaving the rest of Libya in poverty. ,with out a monitored. Equal distribution of oil revenues among all Libyans equally ,nothing will get better
5051 2018-12-20 16:22:43 Dope boy still smelling like cocaina
White boat, white robe, can he be more cleaner?
The oil spill that BP ain't clean up
5052 2018-12-20 16:22:38 Been using it for months without any improvement ... i use the tissue oil only though
5053 2018-12-20 16:22:27 Mfer wants to take atmospheric carbon capture (a good thing) and use the gas to push more oil out of the ground. JFC. Oil money is a psychotic drug. And don't get me started on the role of that money in so called liberal victories and carbon tax failures.
5054 2018-12-20 16:22:15 lovely picture, many memories of the oil int reward...
but had forgotten about the seasonal decor..
5055 2018-12-20 16:22:05 @degrapevine Ms. Field-Henry: I'm a reporter, Bruce Tomaso, 214-914-1759. Trying to reach you for a story I'm writing for Religion News Service @RNS  about Zion Oil & Gas. Please give me a call. Thank you.
5056 2018-12-20 16:22:01 เซงเลยพี่ออย หนูเตี้ยมาก กลัวไม่เห็น
5057 2018-12-20 16:21:56 When they called me to tell me the technician was going to be later than the 5 hour time frame he was given, i told her about my oil not being delivered, she didnt give a shit 
5058 2018-12-20 16:21:53 Abi proudly AA
5059 2018-12-20 16:21:43 my photography teacher told us how when he was little he wanted chicken nuggets an his step dad told him he was old enough to make them himself. He put oil on the stove and left it there because he heard his show come back on and that’s how he burned downed his grandmas kitchen
5060 2018-12-20 16:21:42 You judge why who sold oil at $140 per barrel spent less than who sold below $28 per barrel and still selling below $60 per barrel, presently.
Think about the evil corruption can bring.
5061 2018-12-20 16:21:35 The black seed oil companies might as well hire me as an ambassador the way I come in saving lives.
5062 2018-12-20 16:21:35 Did Obama really say that he was responsible for the current oil boom? After everything he did to prevent it?
5063 2018-12-20 16:21:34 That oil doesn't belong to your disgusting country
5064 2018-12-20 16:21:31 Finally, the Sens version of "Oil Change" we've all been waiting for.
5065 2018-12-20 16:21:23 The closer you are to the top, the more money becomes a primary factor in decisions over safety. The oil industry /oilfield is horribly top-heavy & money-motivated - both personally (bonuses etc) & business (contracts etc).

Higher ups get rewarded for dirty deeds.
5066 2018-12-20 16:21:21 TheUK will pay the pensions as the UK got the contribution money.
Are you saying UK will renage on that?
The UKGOVS OWN FIGURES show they have taken 92% of oil revenues based on population for 50 years.
Are you claiming rUK get NOTHING of scots oil ?
5067 2018-12-20 16:21:17 Girls with natural hair act as if they buy hair oil from the Embassy’s.
5068 2018-12-20 16:21:11 Years back our company would adopt a family for Xmas and buy all kinds of presents both practical and fun. I would always get a Walmart gift card because I figured no matter how nice the gifts were, a gift card could help with the real life needs like groceries, oil changes, etc.
5069 2018-12-20 16:21:03 今日のミスの反省会と称して先輩が飲みに連れていってくれたんだけど一方的にバカにされてつらい
5070 2018-12-20 16:21:02 ไม่น่าหลับเล้ยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยกูววววววววววววววฟหสสกหหหห
5071 2018-12-20 16:20:57 Dude this is how most Americans felt back when Bush was President.    It was Republicans who put us in the Middle East conflicts/wars.  Because oil is more important than American lives.
5072 2018-12-20 16:20:57 Oil change fun. 
5073 2018-12-20 16:20:56 Obviously have not heard the phrase..data is the new oil...and are running on empty
5074 2018-12-20 16:20:56 Choose your comrades carefully - A single drop of oil can contaminate the whole fresh water on voyage.
5075 2018-12-20 16:20:54 By the time we wake up it’s gonna be an new story; the discovered oil was of low grade. Not economic to produce.
5076 2018-12-20 16:20:50 itu utk apa kakyu ? vita oil tu ?
5077 2018-12-20 16:20:48 Wagons have been circling for some time in Canada. Large profitable companies happy to take profits and leave liabilities. Expect more public subsidies for Canada’s oil patch. Big companies co-opt narrative of those actually hurt (small companies and communities).
5078 2018-12-20 16:20:38 Thank you! I am willing to try anything at this point! I have been using Vitamin E, Mederma, CBD Oil and Compound, 500 different lotions (ok, a slight exaggeration) ... but you get where I am going with this. And yes, I may be whining like a baby!
5079 2018-12-20 16:20:33 All of these things are done prior to,  but to make it very clear. What I want is for the federal government to get off their ass and advocate for Alberta.  What I want is for the rest of the country to realize that walking away from oil and gas completely is ridiculous. Clear??
5080 2018-12-20 16:20:32 Take black seed oil
5081 2018-12-20 16:20:30 Does castor oil + coconut oil reaaaaaaalllyyyy works for hair fall problem??????? Help a sissy out here

5083 2018-12-20 16:20:18 This is gonna sound weird but if u have an urge to Somke get black pepper oil and soak toothpick in it and just chew on it it should help
5084 2018-12-20 16:20:15 in space , oil and water can merge
5085 2018-12-20 16:20:13 I have, I love it. I just ran out of oil.
5086 2018-12-20 16:20:03 The good news is that the largest teacher pay increase in Oklahoma history was tied to future oil drilling. #oklaed wanted big oil to pay, now crude is dropping like rock. I guess they don’t teach economics. @okea
5087 2018-12-20 16:19:56 The maybe you should try CBD oil. No matter how you paint it, legalize it, or praise it, marijuana is a depressive when abused. I'd gamble it could be making things worse for you, and that is the sad part.
5088 2018-12-20 16:19:33 Aw. My Daddy brushes my hair all the time. We also do a little spa night thing where he combs coconut oil into it while I read aloud or we watch cartoons. 
5089 2018-12-20 16:19:28 You are correct in that the media is not reporting it fully, as many are now in the US. Russia wants global domination so we can all live as great and free as they do in Russia. Ha. Heating oil or bread anyone?  Folks w facts R making it clear, we want to vote in leaders sans BS.
5090 2018-12-20 16:19:17 DO YOU KNOW CRASHING OIL PRICES ARE ACTUALLY BAD FOR US ECONOMY?  Thousands of jobs will vanish in shale oil. DO YOU KNOW?  OR YOU KNOW VERY WELL,  BUT YOU FAMILY HAS SHORTED OIL? PLEASE ANSWER.
5091 2018-12-20 16:19:17 Because oil
5092 2018-12-20 16:19:07 Another issue is the effect of the ruling on the biologic drug therapies - apparently some must think BPCIA was not part of the ACA , perhaps a conspiracy between an oil company (BP) and an intelligence agency (CIA)
5093 2018-12-20 16:19:07 I can see now why televangelists, time shares, and snake oil are a thing.
5094 2018-12-20 16:19:04 After a winning streak trading $apha took some L's past few days so break time until it clearly breaks it's daily range or a way overdue rebuttal comes. Win some lose some. Bullish on oil and gold. More clear opportunities forming.
5095 2018-12-20 16:18:56 半botです。中の人の正体は…ふふっ、
5096 2018-12-20 16:18:44 I was more thinking of a mining point of view - to who this resource belongs to? It by oil is produced by the ground, but the main financial beneficiary from it are the oil companies. Who gets the benefit and why is the main discussion of power dynamics.
5097 2018-12-20 16:18:39 Venezuela has more oil which is why we are moving hard on south america.
5098 2018-12-20 16:18:39 In 5 years, the Energy Reform of 2013 accomplished more than all the previous reforms of the preceding 50; but it failed 1) to create market capitalization for @Pemex and 2) to replace the dreary tale of oil populism. Now, exploiting those failures, the counter-reform has begun.
5099 2018-12-20 16:18:29 I have Eucalyptus essential oil for my diffuser/humidifier.
5100 2018-12-20 16:18:23 One great premier, and one dinosaur (the tall one)...one found solutions, the other just wants to find more oil for his Irving buddy.
5101 2018-12-20 16:18:21 That I agree with. But of course we will stay because of the oil.
5102 2018-12-20 16:18:18 @FinMinIndia Sir after the demise of my parents in quick succession I filed a case in the court for Succession Certificate.For transmission if Indian oil shares in 2015.court being overburdened is yet to issue.the shares have been kept in MCA.1/2
5103 2018-12-20 16:18:16 Weve been in a state of chaos which allowed 4 a cabinet 2 make massive adjustments while the public stays clueless big business & big oil got Their demands met while the 2 coasts kept the hate game rolling as the left & liberals are NOT 1 in the same all the left does is lose
5104 2018-12-20 16:18:12 The ocean is going to be void of life in 50 years and the world oil will be gone? You must really be depressed, I can't imagine living everyday with such a weight on my shoulders. Is cannabis legal in your state? Maybe you should try some and chill out.
5105 2018-12-20 16:18:09 Watch oil if it dips under 46.20, around 46.08-46.18 would be a nice trap area if it doesnt just smash through it
5106 2018-12-20 16:18:03 DO YOU KNOW CRASHING OIL PRICES ARE ACTUALLY BAD FOR US ECONOMY?  Thousands of jobs will vanish in shale oil. DO YOU KNOW?  OR YOU KNOW VERY WELL,  BUT YOU FAMILY HAS SHORTED OIL? PLEASE ANSWER.
5107 2018-12-20 16:18:01 Bisa aja nih mbaknya wkkwkwkw, oh iya kalau baca deskripsi di website semisal udah mau habis wanginya bisa ditop up essensial oil lagi. Ini essensialnya bisa dibeli juga?

5110 2018-12-20 16:17:51 Just once I would like to go in for an oil change and get the oil change without 50 million "you don't need this, but would you like.....?"s
5111 2018-12-20 16:17:46 Believe it or not this is 100% real!!!!

Called the Sky Ranch. A Texas oil tycoon owns it! TEXAS TTF!!!!!
5112 2018-12-20 16:17:45 Not surprised about these #BetoOrourke pieces about how he's not so progressive & is friendly with the oil industry... Take your most 'progressive' elected from TX, and he/she is probably going to be relatively conservative compared to what we expect on the coasts.
5113 2018-12-20 16:17:38 If you ever want to find a condensed location of negative energy, go get your oil changed. I’m here, enjoying life, writing emails, reading my book and several other people are in here huffing and puffing. The complaints and loud sighs are endless. The negative energy is palpable
5114 2018-12-20 16:17:34 Canada’s oil is probably the cleanest oil made on this planet in terms of worker rights and environmental assessments.
5115 2018-12-20 16:17:14 I'm in a rural area, and while the next county seems worse for this, there are a bunch of "stop the wind turbines!" signs. No actual reasons stated. And it's not even an oil area, it's mostly farms, which may get absolutely fucked by climate change.
5116 2018-12-20 16:17:13 @jimcramer Hey Jim, can you PLEASE tell your aap team to please refrain from recommending oil stocks until they get their head out of their a$$?  First APA, then SLB, and now APC...we don't have unlimited funds, you guys sure need to step it up!
5117 2018-12-20 16:17:12 Anything's a bottle of oil if you're awsome enough.
5118 2018-12-20 16:17:12 Hahaha yer brainwashed, Scotland gets 100% of oil tax revenues,tell everyone who'll pay the pensions after independence
5119 2018-12-20 16:17:10 Quote of the day......
"Watching the NDP act like champions of the oil industry is like watching a vegan try to run a steakhouse"
5120 2018-12-20 16:17:06 Only the snake oil salesman can DEPORT RANDOM CHILDREN!
5121 2018-12-20 16:17:06 So oil can be sold at proper price and have money to clean the environment.  You go around throwing out trash for free?
5122 2018-12-20 16:17:06 Fish oil has nothing to do with anxiety. It's for pain and swelling. And the MAX is 3000 mg.
5123 2018-12-20 16:16:56 Best tak cleansing oil dia?
5124 2018-12-20 16:16:52 I need this oil 
5125 2018-12-20 16:16:45 But oil will be almost useless in less than 30yrs

5127 2018-12-20 16:16:42 How can you be so stupidly gullible?
An ind Scotland would have 92% more of its oil and gas revenues than we do now so stick yer lies up yer arse they will work no longer.
5128 2018-12-20 16:16:37 His original name is Veerapam Oily - for the amount of oil he uses for the family
5129 2018-12-20 16:16:24 I suppose it’s like a 401k that doesn’t cost the people anything to pay into (because that is the countries benefit from the profits of their oil industry and hedge fund management)
5130 2018-12-20 16:16:21 I spilled Castor oil on my carpet.... this is a sign to cut all my hair off
5131 2018-12-20 16:16:09 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, and I want to take a moment to thank them.
5132 2018-12-20 16:16:07 Trump keeps selling public lands to be used for oil and gas drilling and I swear I'm gonna start swinging if he ruins the great American West before I have the fucking chance to go to Yellowstone and the Grand Canyon.
5133 2018-12-20 16:15:39 In CA we have a gas tax that survived an oil and gas backed referendum. I have to assume a lot of middle class and rich people (SUV drivers?) voted to keep the gas tax because it survived 55 to 45.
5134 2018-12-20 16:15:35 @BlaineHiggs - get rid of transfer payments, are you insane? You realize we're broke right? Oil, oil, oil...that's all you can think about...you should be put out to pasture. Terrible leader, archaic thinking.
5135 2018-12-20 16:15:34 I FEEL THIS. 

I've been in auto-pilot for a year and a half. I don't remember the drive, but I didn't check the engine, the oil, etc. and now I'm parked in bad shape with nothing to show for it.
5136 2018-12-20 16:15:33 Leaving all the control and oil revenues. In the hands of the centralized. Coorupt saraj.  Government. ,I’d not resolving. The problem in Libya its making matters much worst
5137 2018-12-20 16:15:30 Everyone has to start somewhere and I’m all about helping and teaching, but he raves on about how good of a Driver he was in the oil fields and shows me unsafe habits, it just grinds my gears
5138 2018-12-20 16:15:29 Yep clarification is needed... Did you jog to work? Does military equipment run on water? Think about it, if it wasn’t for oil and gas you wouldn’t be former military and there wouldn’t be a military. Merry Christmas
5139 2018-12-20 16:15:17 Oil prices getting a historic meeting. ALL RECORDS - Congratulations to $3,874 a person who signed off to get back hard line
5140 2018-12-20 16:15:13 There are many many industries and jobs related to oil industry
5141 2018-12-20 16:15:03 $50B is just federal income tax and GST. Doesn’t include oil or ag. I agree income tax would take a hit in the short term, but $50B is a big cushion.
5142 2018-12-20 16:15:03 ON GOD. I seen this nigga rest his head against the window in the car and that bitch left a oil slick
5143 2018-12-20 16:14:58 Native child’s castor oil
5144 2018-12-20 16:14:53 Will your unit burn hydraulic oil as well as engine?
5145 2018-12-20 16:14:49 Today's Garden Advice from Papa Ziggy: keep a bucket of sand with a little oil in it sitting around where you store your garden tools. After you use a tool, shove it  down into the sand and drag it through a few times.  This will clean it, and oil it so the tool doesn't rust!
5146 2018-12-20 16:14:45 Lowest unemployment in half a century. Lowest minority unemployment rate in history. Record stock markets. All time high investor confidence. Peace in Korea, ISIS is destroyed. #1 crude oil producers in the world basically overnight - gas is $2 a gallon again. 4.2% gdp growth.
5147 2018-12-20 16:14:45 Gotta get my oil changed
5148 2018-12-20 16:14:39 #Total SA is poised to start exports of crude from a major new offshore field in Nigeria, adding to global supplies at a time when oil prices are plunging.
5149 2018-12-20 16:14:37 Hahahaha some Cindy 5kg and oil n markerel
5150 2018-12-20 16:14:33 Is that the land where he used tax payers money to look for oil ?
5151 2018-12-20 16:14:30 Showered, masked on and rubbing my pores with most efficient oil cleansing balm to get rid of impurities. Next is lip therapy ; my fave lip sleeping mask!
5152 2018-12-20 16:14:24 Honestly, being in the Oil & Energy industry is probably the best thing to ever happen to me.
5153 2018-12-20 16:14:21 Don't eat that, Arthur. Jobs in oil, gas, and mineral extraction contribute only 3% of all employment, against which the 1.6% from clean/green tech alone looks pretty impressive.
5154 2018-12-20 16:14:16 How about #beerputnederland?
Mixing chemical waste into shipping oil over there …
5155 2018-12-20 16:14:06 So deep conditioning then oil?
5156 2018-12-20 16:14:03 THE WORLD IS WATCHING 
FRAUDSTERS IN POWER. 

1) Crude oil sales has yielded over N7 trillion.
2) FIRS remitted over N6 trillion.
3) Custom remitted over N1.5 trillion.
4) JAMB over N7.8 billion.
5) NIMASSA over N21.8 billion.
Total- over N15 trillion
ALL GONE IN 3WEEKS

5163 2018-12-20 16:13:29 what essential oil helps people fuck off and die
5164 2018-12-20 16:13:27 Put oil in my car. 

*wow, I’m a mechanic*
5165 2018-12-20 16:13:26 Saudis announce an additional 77,000 barrels of production cuts in excess of the 250,000 agreed to with #OPEC. #oil #crude
5166 2018-12-20 16:13:23 Exactly. I've been watching the punk since then. All these years. He can't pay his bills with oil under $75, so his second best option was to attack us. Not withdraw from Ukraine or Crimea which also would have solved his problems. He must be ground to dust.
5167 2018-12-20 16:13:21 Most of these are good for lady parts. 
But turmeric & fish oil are in there. 
As well as a probiotic
5168 2018-12-20 16:13:18 @ZetdcOfficial What is being done about copper cable theft? Reeks of an inside job, I don't envision an ordinary citizen having the nerve to tamper with high voltage or drain transformer oil!
Cables were cut at 02:30am in Groombridge and we lost power.
5169 2018-12-20 16:13:14 i’ll never forget when josie went through hoops to lie to her dad just so i could go with her to get her oil change lmfao
5170 2018-12-20 16:13:05 I have a problem I cant get much sympathy for, I cant put weight on. I'm never hungry and basically rely on marijuana to have an appetite but I only smoke at night so I'm no hungry during the day.. drinking milk with olive oil and coconut oil to supplement calories and fat..
5171 2018-12-20 16:13:05 You are telling rich scots they need bailed out by those who take 92% of scots oil revenues.
Can you not see how stupid you look?
Scots don't need bailed out at all its another union lie
5172 2018-12-20 16:12:59 MSM will bash Q but will never ask Trump the Question "is Q real". 

Trump could end Q with 1 tweet.

Seb, Trump loves the American people, why would Trump allow people to follow a snake oil merchant when he could have ended the whole Q thing long ago?

@WhiteHouse
@POTUS
5173 2018-12-20 16:12:53 Face oil terakhir
5174 2018-12-20 16:12:47 Quit spinning this @LindseyGrahamSC .  We don't need to be involved in Syria and shouldn't have been.  This is all about oil anyways.  We need to quit offering our troops lives for the elites who seek to profit
5175 2018-12-20 16:12:38 The USA protects our own interests, period. Oil. Natural resources.
5176 2018-12-20 16:12:33 The sky is decorated with thousands of oil paper umbrellas in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. #ChinaDaily 
ท้องฟ้ากถูกประดับประดาด้วยร่มนับพัน ฝน ช่วงมีนาเมษา เมืองเราก็ทำได้น่ะ จากแยกเมอร์ลินถึงมารีนา ศาลเจ้าแม่ 
5177 2018-12-20 16:12:24 As you know, we have an open garage door policy here at the house. And like every Dad's garage, there's a half gallon of everything from oil to antifreeze to washer fluid. Just in case :)
5178 2018-12-20 16:12:24 Peter DeCheese, who, to add insult to injury, received the credit for @JeromyYYC 's motion for Council to support the Alberta Oil Industry. 
You can't make this stuff up, nobody would believe it.
5179 2018-12-20 16:12:18 We contribute more than we get back. Anyway we'll see in a year or two who's struggling. Bearing in mind we'll have oil money for 6 million folk not 60 million.
5180 2018-12-20 16:12:18 For a snack~! Ribeye steak and snap peas sauted with cheddar cheese. Serve with a side of fettuccine in olive oil.
5181 2018-12-20 16:12:11 @ oil prices, wut is you doin boo
5182 2018-12-20 16:12:11 right there should be other besides the oil that is a winding down energy at best - AB has an oil glut not good management no plan to have no job. Plan be get jots in other that oil now folks before they are taken
5183 2018-12-20 16:12:07 Bio oil !
5184 2018-12-20 16:12:06 Thank you! I do have emergency lavender oil and now I'm also two bottles of wine down which has helped. Not tried their basil yet.
5185 2018-12-20 16:11:57 Oil changed without my dad telling me to do so  so adult.
5186 2018-12-20 16:11:56 @LeafsLunch1050 @AndiPetrillo I want to hear some hot oil change talk at some point today
5187 2018-12-20 16:11:44 Russia's solution is to occupy the region & utilize local resources as their own.  Their efficient solution is to kill dissent & leverage adjacent oil competition. How long before Saudi and allies need help, or just arms? Destabilize to war and re-divide, are you trying to incite
5188 2018-12-20 16:11:39 Superb news! The oil business may need to take a back seat though @RacingTrends! Will the lads in Dubai be ok with that?
5189 2018-12-20 16:11:32 The fact that EVERY Oil Producer receives the very same price signals from the market, and the fact that oil is a commodity product, means that every oil producer SHOULD react the same way in a free market, it is in no way evidence of collusion.
5190 2018-12-20 16:11:30 Deku looks like he’s literally made out of pore oil.
5191 2018-12-20 16:11:29 *my dad showing me how to check my oil for the 5th time* he’s like “all cars are the same but different” lmfao
5192 2018-12-20 16:11:25 I made an appointment to get an oil change at 8 and this fucking place still isn’t even open. I better get a discount or something for wasting my time when I got shit to do which is why I made my appointment this early to begin with!!!!
5193 2018-12-20 16:11:16 Oil will help with the dryness but you probably need some moisture to begin with anyway.  The weather always attacks my hair/scalp first
5194 2018-12-20 16:11:15 I love rubbing my skin with olive oil
5195 2018-12-20 16:11:13 I could be laying on a beach with a cold stag in my hand watching my princess play in the sand and my mans slathering me with tanning oil.. but... i am working and i doh have a man. So

5197 2018-12-20 16:11:06 Big oil hates regulations and loves sticking you the people with the bill for cleaning up toxic tailing ponds. I imagine Alberta will be asking the Feds to eventually cough up some $$ to aid  in the cleanup
5198 2018-12-20 16:11:06 After 5 very exciting years, #LegacyExploration is committed to drill horizontally.  We are teaming up with #Schlumberger and some of the best engineers in the world to make #LegacyExploration one of the biggest independent oil and gas companies in the country! #1000BOEPD
5199 2018-12-20 16:11:02 I would say we probably averaged about 500 to 600 gallon. I have a 2000 gallon tank outside the shop this plumbed back into the heater and pump back into an oil drain station. Just depends on the winter I just leave my thermostat set at 50 degrees and let her run
5200 2018-12-20 16:11:01 Called @PetroHome at 7am for oil delivery, its now 11, no oil and my technician is going to be late.
5201 2018-12-20 16:11:01 Getting my oil changed it’s been a minute
5202 2018-12-20 16:11:00 Sir the problems in Nigeria will make you forget everything, fighting the bank charges b4 you know boom  boko haram killed 100 everybody zoom ahh ahh Boko boko b4 you know 1b they miss from excess crude oil Acc otisumi oooooooooooooo
5203 2018-12-20 16:10:52 its a probability....oil is reaching a critical technical level in terms of interest n PA. it indicates a big move in works....which way u work out....
5204 2018-12-20 16:10:48 If you’re so on the ball why did you manage to do bugger all regarding getting oil pipelines to tidewater in the ten years you were in power that last time around? Just asking......
5205 2018-12-20 16:10:19 ＢＢひでえよ…(泣
5206 2018-12-20 16:10:13 “At all” requires energy east, or some other arrangement that deals with Saudi oil removal from Canada.
5207 2018-12-20 16:10:11 Fellow, #BTS #ARMY and followers, looking for suggestions on your favorite brand of Vitamin E oil or most effective scar cream. Something that will soften them - make them less stiff. 

Please and thank you! 
5208 2018-12-20 16:10:10 In 1910, Gulf Oil launched the world's first ever water drilling operation. #ThrowbackThursday
5209 2018-12-20 16:10:03 今日午後からゲリラサラダ油来るらしいよ。
5210 2018-12-20 16:09:59 What about the billions of dollars of their oil that we buy them. And the THOUSANDS of Alberta jobs lost because we buy their oil
5211 2018-12-20 16:09:58 Hello Beauties!!! .

Our December Luxe kit is here and it comes with a little twist!!! .

Each kit would have . • Oil Cleanser: Either Banila Co Clean it Zero or DHC Cleansing Oil

 •Cleanser: Either Soap + Glory Vitamin C Facial Wash or Cetaphil Cleanser . . .
5212 2018-12-20 16:09:40 But it’s so much fun when doing cardio.

Or when you’re hungover and DGAF. 
5213 2018-12-20 16:09:40 Things googled at 8am:
What can I use to gas out a spider from my car?

Result- peppermint oil is the miracle of all essential oils. And it smells good.
5214 2018-12-20 16:09:39 nivel de ingles?

- juelves
5215 2018-12-20 16:09:36 Yea it’s definitely the weather ima try one of those options..i jus said hot oil cuz thats wat my barber told me lol
5216 2018-12-20 16:09:30 Irving Oil brings it in, not Trudeau. You of all people should now that. Was @stephenharper responsible before that? #cdnpoli
5217 2018-12-20 16:09:19 We lack a consistent strategy due to the weakness of both Liberals & PC's.  Canadians are strong but that is not evident in our political decisions.  Why are we dependent on Saudi oil and Americans, because of poor decision in the past. We sell our roads to foreigners.  Wake Up.
5218 2018-12-20 16:09:10 It's David Sirota. Taibbi was all over it. I couldn't read the tweet because Sirota blocked me, for having a problem with his "oil industry" mud slinging, I guess. But I'm glad Bernie included Beto in that group. I've said it before: Sanders is ill-served by some of his fans.
5219 2018-12-20 16:09:08 Try avocado oil next
5220 2018-12-20 16:09:06 “I think they pan fry the gnocchi”
- Robyn Hodess, Oil on Canvas, circa 1939
5221 2018-12-20 16:08:54 BTW: why are we in "the hood" in the first place?  I hear many referring to this as our "national interest", but I've never seen a list of exactly what that is.  Take their oil?  Built yet another military base just in case Russia challenges US hegemony?
5222 2018-12-20 16:08:50 So refreshing to see all the factors, which indeed has plenty to do with varied Land Grabs, even Foreign, and the too little spoken about Oil, Fracking.
5223 2018-12-20 16:08:48 i thought it was an oil spill
5224 2018-12-20 16:08:39 At $1,10 a liter at the pump, we don't see the difference. All dirty oil
5225 2018-12-20 16:08:39 Aku aja pake cleansing oil tipeku kombi
5226 2018-12-20 16:08:38  let me meet Vondy IRL and I’ll smack the fuck out that bald ass head of his with baby oil for not fixing blue screens yet 
5227 2018-12-20 16:08:37 Just so I have this straight he, lowered taxes, icreaed oil production, lowered jobless rate, negotiated successfully with China and NKorea, however no movement on the walldue to Left and Right vitriol and non cooperation, and he is a failure....  seriously????
5228 2018-12-20 16:08:25 The snake oil salesmen ran the leave campaigns!
5229 2018-12-20 16:08:08 When I first started dying my hair, I had never bleached before and didn’t know how to take care of it. I used a styling oil meant for use with hair dryers and then flat ironed instead. I ironed oil into my hair. It FRIED. Had to cut off several inches. But now I love my cut
5230 2018-12-20 16:08:04 Me: wow, this story of man's conflict with himself and nature is really compelling
Melville: SO HERE'S HOW YOU TURN WHALE BLUBBER INTO LAMP OIL FOR THREE CHAPTERS
5231 2018-12-20 16:08:02 And oil prices more recently too.
5232 2018-12-20 16:07:56 Somehow managed to get Olbus Oil in my eye, what a fucking cock.
5233 2018-12-20 16:07:53 As A American Patriot "I feel this is a bad decision" Economically and Petro 
We will lose control on the oil fields. Why the F... Do you believe we went to Iraq in the first place? It was blood money - (R) Are not understanding #DUMB
5234 2018-12-20 16:07:46 The pipeline idea makes even less sense when you consider the fact that neither Israel or Saudia have need of this oil (which can be turned off at the source anyways).

Also oil right now is at a very low price, at around 50 dollars a barrel , its not profitable.
5235 2018-12-20 16:07:44 Change Oil ka nanaman ssob @VyPascua
5236 2018-12-20 16:07:43 During the last 5 trading days, the DJIA has lost 5.78% and is in corrective territory. Oil is currently trading at $46.70 and is in bear market territory.
5237 2018-12-20 16:07:36 Klo gw pake tea tree oil utk spot treatment,merk happy green atau purivera

5239 2018-12-20 16:07:31 Employers in Naija will be like "with over 20m unemployed people like you, who give you mouth to negotiate pay?"
The politics of this country has failed it's youth, sadly we oil it's machine continuously.
5240 2018-12-20 16:07:23 Cool but probably shouldn’t roast with olive oil. It doesn’t react well to high temperatures.
5241 2018-12-20 16:07:12 Cool, you've identified the problem. Now, what's the solution? Hint - it ain't continuing down the oil train. That dog don't... Renew... Ok, it got squirrelly at the end, but you get my point.
5242 2018-12-20 16:07:10 Alberta’s oil is low quality and expensive in a market that’s increasingly competitive. No politician can change that.
5243 2018-12-20 16:07:00 @kfayemi that means they'll patronise the rice sellers, the oil sellers and the dairy products sellers too smile home. Such is the spiral effect of governance at the local level. I will keep on saying this till you do the needful sir, and I'll thank you for it.
5244 2018-12-20 16:06:58 How do i get all this damn oil out my hairrrrrrrrrrrrr
5245 2018-12-20 16:06:54 last time gold was at this price in July miners were considerably higher, oil has also gone down which should help miners bottom line
5246 2018-12-20 16:06:54 This shows oil prices killing the post war boom. Meaningless without international comparisons.
5247 2018-12-20 16:06:36 I use so much coconut oil my sweat smells like it too. 
5248 2018-12-20 16:06:31 Tick tock....have you got oil in your lamps? Maranatha!
5249 2018-12-20 16:06:27 My in-laws do the same as what John described. They also sell waste oil heaters. Got into that for the reason your asking about what to do with it.
5250 2018-12-20 16:06:27 Putin, gets an oil pipeline and access to ports which is why he took Crimea from Ukraine. No gives a shit about Syria it's all been about oil, or denying Putin oil.  Let him have it, it's not our fight and RS will be spending money they dont have defending it for decades.
5251 2018-12-20 16:06:26 No. Not being told to scare me. Its a very rational discussion about the effect of tariffs on olive oil, canned tomatoes etc.
5252 2018-12-20 16:06:22 - The oil & gas industry is thriving in all other major energy producers, with the exception of Venezuela (see “socialism”)

- Norway is a unitary state. Alberta is a sub national jurisdiction that has contributed $220 billion net to the rest of the federation in the past decade.
5253 2018-12-20 16:06:17 That something was losing that Snake Oil salesman Pepe Imaz
5254 2018-12-20 16:06:09 Jangan dipegang2. Ditoelin pake tbs tea tree oil ya allah mantul banget
5255 2018-12-20 16:06:06 ...says "I bleed Oil". Beat it.

5257 2018-12-20 16:05:52 I love Salad specially green onions green garlic cherry tomatoes , lot of mint , beetroot , mix with nuts & toping with olive oil honey vinegar. Yummmmm
5258 2018-12-20 16:05:45 They have to- France needs their oil & Syria has been its puppet since 1919.
5259 2018-12-20 16:05:41 We broke up Standard Oil and AT@T for monopolistic practices, we need to do the same with Google and others.

Tech giants are imposing deliberate bias to manipulate United States elections, and pose a bigger threat to The American Republic than AT&T and Standard oil ever did.
5260 2018-12-20 16:05:41 Few of the 5 a day healthy ratio
5261 2018-12-20 16:05:39 - Global consumption of oil has increased by 10 million barrels per day over the past decade.

- The @IEA projects growing global demand for oil & gas through at least 2040

- US oil production doubled under President Obama’s tenure. The US now a net oil exporter.
5262 2018-12-20 16:05:36 Blend up some oats and mix it with milk & honey for a face mask! A good scrub I’ve always loved is 1 part sugar 1 part coconut oil and a few drops of tea tree oil but some people are getting triggered about said oil so idk but coconut oil never hurt me 
5263 2018-12-20 16:05:28 Open Canada's North West passage year round - move the tree line north - make millions of square kilometres habitable & open to tourism in the Arctic - facilitate road access to oil, gas mineral reserves - it's a win win for Canada!
5264 2018-12-20 16:05:27 Trump & admin is trying to kill off smaller oil and gas companies so your buddies will benefit?  yeah add to the defense budget while americans are suffering!  @cspan @aarp
5265 2018-12-20 16:05:23 Go for it. One of JZ/Gupta's lads for a good couple of years. Would love too see if still Mr Fear Fokop. If law could take its course. Gigaba Dlamini Faithless Jesse and Mrs Brown. Plus Aunty that sold the oil. Plus the espionage letter that was given to JZ about PG.Who wrote it.
5266 2018-12-20 16:05:18 @kfayemi Release their allocation your excellency, traders, artisans, students, workers, and the common man on the street feel government most at the local level. These local councils, for instance, distributed rice, chickens, and oil last year to lots of people.
5267 2018-12-20 16:04:56 En tarvitse. Olen vasynyt. Minä aloitin toissa klo 1 ja loppui klo 6:30 mutta tytto ei nuku klo 8 asti. Minulla oil ehka nelja tunttia nukkua. Jumala auttaa
5268 2018-12-20 16:04:53 What have you done other than indirectly killing reporters, causing a slow war and polluting the world with oil? Jail baby
5269 2018-12-20 16:04:48 YOU nvdaded Iraq and went into other oil producing Nations. The rest of the world HAYES the way you impose yourself on them for economic reasons only. Shit Country!!
5270 2018-12-20 16:04:48 This is one of the world's top oil producers?

5273 2018-12-20 16:04:34 The best oil connection one can put here, is that there are some oil fields in the northern Kurdish regions , which Assad would like in order to rebuild his army (and secure his position), The US help to the Kurds has until now prevented that from happening.
5274 2018-12-20 16:04:19 Promise cause my black ass put all this coconut oil on and I’m still ashy I’m like wtf I hate the winter time

5276 2018-12-20 16:04:17 If it is a cerebellar stroke you may need to use Dr google because that damned FAST acronym should BEFAST. Diagnosis missed in hospital where visiting when happened, in visit to family doc, again in ER.  Lavender oil useful in triggering migraines if that is what you want to do
5277 2018-12-20 16:04:15 Think so. The oil & gas fatcats are hanging in there as well as those on top of the financial casino who don’t play fair and square. Saw where Mnuchin said those damn regulations are pulling down the market.
5278 2018-12-20 16:04:05 Hitler thought he knew more than his Generals and his Field Marshall’s, ala Stalingrad, and his abandonment of the push on Moscow to take the oil fields of Baku in Russia’s southern caucuses and we all know the end result as Russia pushed into Berlin and Hitler Dead. Trump, lol!

5285 2018-12-20 16:03:28 And North Sea Oil had nothing to do with it. Europhobes have been taking facts out of context for a long time.
5286 2018-12-20 16:03:24 BC would pay by way of oil and consumer prices. duh
5287 2018-12-20 16:03:20 I’ve been putting straight olive oil in my hair and let me tell you these curls are THRIVING
5288 2018-12-20 16:03:13 Been waiting to tell OPEC TO GO FUK THEMSELVES SINCE THE 1ST EMBARGO .. CARTER SAID “We need oil independence “ 44 years later and we are still playing with them ... #opecfukoff
5289 2018-12-20 16:03:13 You are completely wrong. Other oil so neither cheaper nor cleaner. This is the problem! Canadian oil is the cheapest in the world and as clean as any other. Every province needs oil, they are just hypocrites.
5290 2018-12-20 16:02:51 ıf russia and assad protect the pkk near turkeys border.. Turkish energy ministery must stop russians oil exports to europe with our pipelines
5291 2018-12-20 16:02:44 Not to mention the MILLIONS of innocent civilians killed. Stfu we there for oil and poppies, and i personally think we are there to persecute and kill Muslims. Worst think in our world
5292 2018-12-20 16:02:39 PP contracts are falling nearly double digits again this month due to excess PGP supply, lower oil prices, and seasonally soft demand.  PE contracts are also falling due to excess supply from this year's massive increases in capacity.
5293 2018-12-20 16:02:37 [chuckles and presses a soft kiss to your neck, hands crawling up your arms]

should i get the oil, kyun?
5294 2018-12-20 16:02:32 I stand by my aforementioned two points-and think we have to remember the changed picture is partly a matter of how well unconventional oil has done.
Take them out and things look different.
5295 2018-12-20 16:02:27 Norway is a pretty innovative country mate, they also have an amazing system of “state capitalism” which is basically a way of them balancing the state owning 50% of all businesses with using revenue from their oil production and putting it into a hedge fund managed by the state
5296 2018-12-20 16:02:25 Gahhh I usually can never tell... even with 60mg. So I do those in edibles or I smoke the oil with a pen, those help a LOT. I was able to taper off my blood pressure meds b/c of it

5298 2018-12-20 16:02:16 King  Sark please don’t let this cup of oil pass my head  @sarkodie
5299 2018-12-20 16:02:16 The argument is bullshit.  All of the obfuscation notwithstanding, oil is the entire reason that Alberta pays equalization.
5300 2018-12-20 16:02:16 There's no position. Syria has no strategic interest there at the minute. Absolutely don't want to fight Turkey right now. They'll continue to hoover up towards oil fields. How is this difficult to see? Its not a bad negotiating position its a zero one.
5301 2018-12-20 16:02:15 How can wind and solar replace the liquid fuels in our society Alex?  Airplane travel?  Trains and trucks to move cargo around Canada?  Norway's oil industry is nationalized and believe it or not they will run out of money too as all socialist programs do.

5303 2018-12-20 16:02:13 Alberta needs Canada. Canada doesn’t need Alberta. The loudest Albertans lack of understanding how the world works is a source of great shame to the rest of us. There’s hope tho - at class, my classmates were discussing the oil industry, and not one was on their side.
5304 2018-12-20 16:02:12 this is his first game at lucas oil since super bowl xlvi
5305 2018-12-20 16:02:09 Even as our money is majorly from oil. Job opportunities in the oil industry is below 20%
5306 2018-12-20 16:01:55 Maybe if that dingdong showed some real leadership and got shit done instead of making tearful apologies to people he doesn't care about. Or stop trying to play both sides talking about climate change while simultaneously fighting for big oil.
Prick.
5307 2018-12-20 16:01:54 Yep just going borrow more tax money from the population give it to your buddies over seas and than give us back $20 meanwhile shutting down Ab/Sk oil and the power plants in south east sask maybe get off your ass and come see the lively hoods you are about to ruin
5308 2018-12-20 16:01:49 So I was in a governorship debate for my state, Nasarawa state yesterday and one of the candidates said we have abt 71 solid minerals & even crude oil in d state. 
I know officially we have abt 25 solid minerals.
 I want to know if his claims are true cos I can't believe him o.

5311 2018-12-20 16:01:40 We are only in the Middle East for oil, it has nothing to do with anything else
5312 2018-12-20 16:01:36 No it wasn’t.  it was oil and Israel that drove us there.
5313 2018-12-20 16:01:33 My mechanic gave me a free oil change as a Christmas gift

5323 2018-12-20 16:00:51 Good, but there is a fine line.  Trump's supporters will stop producing when it hurts their pockets.  Already a rumbling out there in the oil fields. If it don't pay then the tap goes righty tighty. Compliments of the Season to you and yours And a much better AIM in the New Year

5327 2018-12-20 16:00:30 Um no... in the 1970s the us was in full control.of the oil and the price.they were called the seven sisters. When exploration started to slow and supply demand went upside down, the us gvt. went to the middle east. It was then  ME created OPEC. Then OPEC set supply , price.

5342 2018-12-20 15:59:36 As a stylist with a husband that hasn't worked as an engineer in the oil industry for 4 years, it comes up in every conversation.  It's like, let's just get this out of the way, "You are a failure".  But I have the power not to accept critics.  Too many nice people out there.
5343 2018-12-20 15:59:22 There must be 2 Venezuela(s) coz the one in the amaricas has no dictator. They are suffering because of malicious sanctions by ppl who want to loot its oil reserves ppl who want regime change by all means and not for the benefit of the ppl but greedy western corporations
5344 2018-12-20 15:59:14 It comes down to priorities, keep innocent people out fleeing violence or Medicare 4 All helping to maintain your workforce like changing the oil in a fleet?  Because the workers are underpaid and can't make a living wage.  Food & Medical Care are necessities.
5345 2018-12-20 15:59:06 They are interested in our oil. And they will not get a single block Insha Allah.
5346 2018-12-20 15:59:04 Do u even know the meaning of recession? If do you will know this country going into recession is solely GMB hand work and not anybody, not even global oil market price.

5348 2018-12-20 15:58:33 @JustinTrudeau How many more Canadians have to be Detained in #China before you display the same discourse as you do against the USA (Our greatest Ally)... while were talking, Justin how about some comments on when we'll help develop Canadian Oil instead of Buying Saudi oil?
5349 2018-12-20 15:58:31 Graham gets a pass on this. He knows that Putin can now make Syria a satellite province of Russia and have a strategic foot hold completely unchecked by the US in the Middle East. Eventually, Russia and Putin will annex the Middle East for its oil reserves & control the markets
5350 2018-12-20 15:58:30 I’d like to know who these consultants are... I think we should all call the snake oil out - if it to be true.
5351 2018-12-20 15:58:30 ugh tell me about it, I try to take my glasses off a couple of times a day and wipe off any oil build up (gross) either on my face or glasses to prevent it
5352 2018-12-20 15:58:30 Be my peace & oil my scalp.
5353 2018-12-20 15:58:20 If this 12.2 million members pay their taxes of N1000 per annum we won’t sell oil again. Oya FIRS go to the Association register. Meanwhile 12.2 million farmers can feed the whole of Africa
5354 2018-12-20 15:58:19 What about Leavinf syria before killing the last bastion of Isis and giving the oil fields and Euphrates river valley to Iran and allowing Russia and Assad to consolidate control over areas we liberated?
5355 2018-12-20 15:58:03 @jidesanwoolu Sir, now that Lagos has been included in oil producing areas. Are we going to have a ministry for that?
5356 2018-12-20 15:58:02 So now we have laurentian elites eh?  How about the oil baron elites?  The business elites?  The wealthy elites?  The Fordnation elites? “Elite” has become a word the “right” are using to spread their anger and hate. No sense behind this discourse, except hate.

5365 2018-12-20 15:57:11 - The oil & gas industry is thriving in all other major energy producers, with the exception of Venezuela (see “socialism”)

- Norway is a unitary state. Alberta is a sub national jurisdiction that has contributed $220 billion net to the rest of the federation in the past decade

5368 2018-12-20 15:57:01 They don't want a picture of what everybody already knows exists, Chinese oil tankers openly breaking UN Sanctions by providing North Korea with fuel
5369 2018-12-20 15:56:57 US has massive oil reserves too. Doesn't stop countries wanting more
5370 2018-12-20 15:56:52 Immigration can be enforced and curtailed without spending $20billion+ on a wall that can be scaled or dug under. If people want to get in here, they will find a way. The wall is nothing more than snake oil. We might as well light that money on fire.
5371 2018-12-20 15:56:46 If demand was increasing, so to would the price.  People can be mad and protest, but the market doesn't demonstrate greater demand or a higher price for Alberta oil right now.  If we had a pipeline, we'd just be selling more for even less.
5372 2018-12-20 15:56:45 It already is mainstream and creating more energy, more efficiently for lower cost than anyone could have predicted. Now just a question of scaling up. And with UK renewable energy market up 56% in 2017, won’t be long. Read those articles I sent. Then sell your oil &gas shares.
5373 2018-12-20 15:56:43 Oil is priced in dollars, but oil does NOT back the dollar. Taxes do that.  And the Fed just sets interest rates.  Why not go after the congress????
5374 2018-12-20 15:56:40 Mr President you’ve done sooooo much - with Dems, the media, the DOJ, CIA, FBI, the Fed and half the GOP in DC against you. Hot economy, jobs, deregulation, trade deals, tax reform, gas prices, reduced reliance on foreign oil, black unemployment, prison reform. Time for a wall!!!
5375 2018-12-20 15:56:40 If I wear any of my essential oil perfumes everyone freaks out and can't handle the smell.  Like, just leave it alone dumbass.
5376 2018-12-20 15:56:32 Ahem.... sorry that is not London bridge. 
50 years ago, London Bridge was sold to American oil tycoon Robert P McCulloch for a cool $2,460,000. The landmark was subsequently dismantled and shipped over to Lake Havasu in Arizona, where it was reassembled and still stands today.

5380 2018-12-20 15:56:16 Freedoms and defending others is not the reason for war. It’s about capitalists competing with other capitalists over who gets to control the land, resources, markets. The case in the Middle East... oil. That doesn’t encourage people to fight wars. So noble reasons are invented.

5391 2018-12-20 15:55:04 No.  I'm simply frustrated that you seem to lack a basic understanding of something you are commenting on.
OPEC and all of the oil companies get exactly the same pricing signals.  Economics dictates the same reaction, so them being rational actors dictates they react the same way
5392 2018-12-20 15:55:03 What is big deal ? We can loan from world bank , other wise we can mortgage Gold to UK .  We can get oil on credit basis . We will see up to 90% black money .

5396 2018-12-20 15:54:50 Now you're simply putting words in my mouth and claiming they are lies.

Studies show that tanker transport is the safest way to transport oil. It has fewer releases per bbl shipped than rail or PL.

Vancouver doesn't want tankers, they're content being NAs largest coal exporter.

5398 2018-12-20 15:54:49 My question to you is are yo ok with the US leaving Syria and abandoning the land we fought for and 3/4 of the oil we hold with SDF? You ok with Turkey slaughtering an American ally because we turned and ran the 1st chance we got. This makes us look weak and cowardly to the world
5399 2018-12-20 15:54:44 As a former 22 year vet.  I think you’re making a big mistake in this one Mr. Trump.  Oil passes through those waters and Russia will now move in to control those passages.  Moreover, Syria will be overrun by the Talban.
5400 2018-12-20 15:54:38 Oil is necessary still. For our economic & other survival. There is no such thing as an ethical or environmentally friendly oil or industry. Why the big lie? We can be proud of our country without it. #forshame

5407 2018-12-20 15:54:18 This isn’t truthfully presented. Oil is Texas’ largest employer, and many of the people who gave individual donations happened to have jobs with that industry. Like, normal jobs. To feed their families. If a custodian for Proctor and Gamble donates, it didn’t come from big pharma
5408 2018-12-20 15:54:11 Like sometimes you can just look on your counter and notice the zucchini is looking pretty sexy and then find some frozen peas and pasta and a bit of Parm - olive oil and a splash of cream voilà! 

It’s so satisfying
5409 2018-12-20 15:54:11 yeah let's stay in that country and steal oil that belongs to the citizens of that country.

5413 2018-12-20 15:53:47 Such a fun coincidence that this totally organic, non-manufactured "protest" (organized by oil & gas industry) just happened to take place on the same day, at the same time, and in the same place as an event you hosted.

And they let you play in one of the trucks too!!!

#cdnpoli
5414 2018-12-20 15:53:44 Agreed on that, but the kind of oil definitely matters, corn oil being least efficient. Have you heard of water frying? You can't use it for everything but good for reducing!
5415 2018-12-20 15:53:43 Not by choice...I'm right pissed off at our dependance on Saudi oil when we've got Alberta. I'd take that statement further but I'd get the boot from Twitter. Suffice it to say, not all Ontarians got their heads in the sand...
5416 2018-12-20 15:53:42 and to top off this oh-so-fucking happy night, she's stunk up the house some more with that nauseating snake oil. so i give her an extra heavy dousing of my hugo boss cologne.
5417 2018-12-20 15:53:42 He should not take oil money and should back universal health care. We are making people aware that this country and planet can’t afford another centrist who is loyal to oil industry and big pharma. That’s the issue. If he was an actual advocate for clean energy and hr676 then 
5418 2018-12-20 15:53:41 um are you sharing headline writers with @22_Minutes or did Schmeer really say that nonsense?

5419 2018-12-20 15:53:41 LOL, that's none of your beeswax Joel, LOL, just kidding... hot mineral oil and Q tips 
5420 2018-12-20 15:53:39 We can agree on the last part which is the most important thing. Also Iran and Turkey’s interests in the region are nothing short of genocidal, Assad couldn’t care less about isis, and Russia needs regional control to advance his military ambitions. So saying oil is simplistic.
5421 2018-12-20 15:53:37 ts true. Countries like UAE who only allowed shareholding of oil fields to majors like US,UK, France, Japan etc. have lately opened it up for India. ONGC is now one of the major shareholders in UAE oil field-Lower Zakhum. All due to Modi energy policy.
5422 2018-12-20 15:53:36 Apparently the fact that US now produces vast amounts of shale and no longer relies on MIdeast oil is not a factor here.

Neither is apparently the fact that Syria is not a country that produces massive amounts of oil
5423 2018-12-20 15:53:18 What haven't Ghanaians comply? 
We have complied since 1967 to 2018. Dubai has turned Desert to modern world, what did the citizens do? They have only oil, South Korea has no resources, are Ghanaians not doing enough? Ask the Toffee seller if he is not complying.
5424 2018-12-20 15:53:13 I got the oil change, ima get the brakes next week cause I bought a new phone but ima sell the old one for the brakes, even trade

5428 2018-12-20 15:53:00 Clarification clearly needed. I am a senior, former military. I also live in rural Alberta and was not personally impacted by yesterdays disgusting display. Yes, I support oil and gas but I am sick of the whining. Need a job? Head to your nearest CF Recruiting Center. #ableg
5429 2018-12-20 15:52:52 Our January schedule is filled with #professionaldevelopment opportunities including a #CRSP study group and an OHS/WCB Workshop.

5431 2018-12-20 15:52:46 Farmers welfare called a farm bill to clean up the mess made by trade war Oil companies welfare. Railroad totally subsidisss, electric cars totally subsidized. Many southern states survive on welfare.
5432 2018-12-20 15:52:33 But so, too, does boiling oil.  Welcome back to the middle ages!
5433 2018-12-20 15:52:27 It’s a possiblity. I bathe mine everyday and then rub a ton of lotion on her! I wash her fuzz head every other or every couple days. If her head is dry I try to do more coconut oil than lotion
5434 2018-12-20 15:52:27 I love using oregano oil in capsules whenever we are sick!
5435 2018-12-20 15:52:25 This is an excellent article Anthony. Living in Northern AB for many years, I watched as they bought up gas stations, hotels, restaurants, oil companies and mines. It concerned me then. It REALLY concerns me now. But everybody is ....Russia. China quietly doing stuff and we're 
5436 2018-12-20 15:52:25 OPEC and Oil Companies receive the same pricing signals.  Why is such a mystery that they react in similar, rational ways?  The pricing signals are the same, and basic economics dictates the same response.

5438 2018-12-20 15:52:13 Anybody know how to reset the oil life display on a Honda 2013 accord even after resetting all settings? Lol
5439 2018-12-20 15:52:12 They're fucking disgusting, like the worst kind of snake oil salesman or  cult leaders. Base self interest wrapped up in people's real fears and sanctimony. I feel like I'm being radicalised, not by the MSM and the You Know Whos, but by them being incessantly awful pieces of shit

5443 2018-12-20 15:51:58 巽とさくら生前の関係者説を事前に考えていたことによって若干浮かされた心持ちになりにくくなってしまった感があるので、やっぱ最終回見る前に考察とかしない方がいいなと思いました
5444 2018-12-20 15:51:57 I got the oil change, but I got a new phone . But ima get my brakes fixed in a week.
5445 2018-12-20 15:51:56 Get rid of the fed. Make all notes US treasury notes and not federal reserve notes backed by Gold, Silver, Oil, Gas and all other resources.
5446 2018-12-20 15:51:45 Minority case for a shit box car tuned for a nation obsessed with oil changes. Modern cars with go 20k between oil changes.
5447 2018-12-20 15:51:38 Not yet. My Neice in Toronto is on the board of directors of an IPO startup last year to sell the oil thruout the world.
5448 2018-12-20 15:51:32 Syria is not about terrorists. It’s about oil.
5449 2018-12-20 15:51:27 Some things to remember:
1. Different ways of calculating reserves. (Proven, probable, possible. Which are they claiming on a given occasion? Plus tech and price changes turn possible to proven.) 
2. Oil consumption growth did slow down (in part because economic growth did).
5450 2018-12-20 15:51:16 Hey you know how to change your oil that's good!! You can just learn how to change your wipers and you'll be alright.
5451 2018-12-20 15:51:12 @Ocasio2018 In my humble opinion. We need a gradual transition from oil. From gas. Then from wind and solar.  Then from hydro and nukes. Our engineers and scientists will find new energy sources. Maybe not on our planet. Maybe not atom based.
5452 2018-12-20 15:51:11 cleansing oil
5453 2018-12-20 15:51:08 Lesson I learned in my short stint trading oil: Just because experts are saying something "is due for a bounce" or "is overextended to the downside" doesn't mean it still can't go lower $USO
5454 2018-12-20 15:51:05 che putin!  como anda el oil?
5455 2018-12-20 15:51:00 I have shea butter and coconut oil 
Works really well for my body but my face..ughh just has a mind of its own
5456 2018-12-20 15:50:48 Are you trying to justify your actions? We get nothing? We make sure that terrorists don't gain control of oil fields (especially since you cut back on alt energy research). We make sure the surrounding countries don't get attacked, and you act like we're the only country there.
5457 2018-12-20 15:50:43 If the markets crash then what happens to oil? 
5458 2018-12-20 15:50:40 I don’t think this is about Turkey. I think this is a deflection due to the Mueller probe turning white hot. He’s sitting in a vat of hot oil and will do virtually anything to get out of it.
#IndictTrumpNow!
5459 2018-12-20 15:50:38 We don't want friends in the EU or the UN. We don't want to rely on foreign oil and Chinese manufacturing. We're a strong nation and your negativity is just more transparent manipulation. #DefundCBC
5460 2018-12-20 15:50:33 . @dpradhanbjp: Strength of India’s emerging oil diplomacy stems from fact that dominant oil producers&global energy market now acknowledges&works for India's best interests. India’s voice for responsible pricing&discontinuing discriminatory Asian Premium has gathered steam.
5461 2018-12-20 15:50:33 Makes perfect sense.  Oil/gas producers and refiners burn off methane.  If they can burn it off, why not just just it as a fuel?

5465 2018-12-20 15:50:16 We do not need someone who takes money from oil. Over 400k if it after pledging and not holding true to it. This planet needs someone who will fight to save the planet. Not take money from the main threat.
5466 2018-12-20 15:49:47 just watch someone take a dab with salt nic juice instead of oil and uh now i know i’ve seen it all
5467 2018-12-20 15:49:45 Brown-Dupree oil company out of Ulysses use to come down here to the OK panhandle and buy it if you have over a certain amount. Don’t know how far they’re willing to go to get it.

5469 2018-12-20 15:49:44 It is absolutely about oil. 

There’s a pipeline going through Syria. If it goes north, it goes to Russia. 

If it goes west, it goes to Israel & Saudi Arabia. 

And the United States Government & Russian Government do not care one iota about the human beings in Syria.
5470 2018-12-20 15:49:43 I am soo in love with my patchouli oil.
5471 2018-12-20 15:49:41 You have to remember, I once worked for a multinational, multifaceted oil company. I know capitalism. I was a friend of capitalism. The WB suits are... not capitalists.
5472 2018-12-20 15:49:37 Yup. You’re my entertainment while getting my car’s oil changed. Keep going. I think your next tweet might be the one!
5473 2018-12-20 15:49:36 Please research and explain why Alberta does not build refineries and manufacture oil based products like plastics for export.  Why don't they choose to diversify their economy?  Why not manufacture? Underselling potential.
5474 2018-12-20 15:49:33 If we had a Social Security card that was plastic, name only and a chip in it for data many of the food stamp dollars would disappear. We also spend billions on oil subsidies, Chevron Execs minimum salary $5 million plus perks, Exxon higher.
5475 2018-12-20 15:49:16 It’s what bill C-69 will do to Canadian oil.  Putting foreign oil under the same microscope is only fair.
5476 2018-12-20 15:49:10 みんながそうやって炒められて揚げられて…ねぇ、誰のおかげ?誰のおかげかな?

＼It's OIL!!!／
5477 2018-12-20 15:49:06 I remember about 40 years ago we were all told that we had about 50 years left of accessible oil reserves and I'm sure that at the time they underestimated the energy consumption of the world. There are lots of reserves, but we should be focusing on and encouraging alternatives.
5478 2018-12-20 15:49:00 メンタルつらい
5479 2018-12-20 15:48:49 Oil Companies "control" is independent companies responding to free-market signals (price).

OPEC is a different matter entirely, they are a price-fixing cartel, as that is their explicit purpose.
5480 2018-12-20 15:48:42 SJJSKSD POOR ALBERTA .. literally all I hear is “wah wah dealing with oil regulations and environmental reports is SO hard :’(“ like ur literally a landlocked province. MORE bureaucracy is not gonna help .
5481 2018-12-20 15:48:40 Teneris: Creemos que estamos en los inicios de un rebote en la valuación de 20% en dólares.  La empresa actualmente trabaja con un descuento de casi 30% en dólares con una estimación de beneficios que toma un precio del petróleo de 47 dólares, ya no es viable el shale oil

5483 2018-12-20 15:48:38 The oil flows down from the head, down the beard to the body... A nation that is unable or unwilling to change the Leadership being elected, is essentially stuffed.
5484 2018-12-20 15:48:36 Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated.  Try some weed or cbd oil, it helps me when I have stomach aches.  I don't really get headaches because I drink mostly water, eat healthy, practice yoga, and meditate every day

5486 2018-12-20 15:48:32 Oil prices in the 50s at the moment but Nigeria benchmarks $60/bbl for its 2019 budget and The Saudis benchmark $80/bbl for their 2019 budget. Blind optimism or informed forecasting?
5487 2018-12-20 15:48:30 Ha Ha, @KHayhoe & team are very professional, she is a great AGW communicator, not negative or judgemental against big oil & gas, she just knows we must transtion their capital & jobs over time.  The videos don't spread fear, they give hope & it is about opportunity!  
5488 2018-12-20 15:48:26 He is a damn dem in disguise.  A total mistake. He is so wrong to do this. No inflation, no high oil prices, market has basically corrected itself and this is bad for car loans, houses, so much.
5489 2018-12-20 15:48:25 How very kind.  Merry Christmas 
5490 2018-12-20 15:48:25 Seems like negative awareness... Alberta protests 1 day after receiving 1.6 billion dollars for oil industry. 

With no solutions proposed, no clear issues communicated, and  alienated commuters I'd say yesterday only make Alberta look dumber.

5495 2018-12-20 15:48:01 Did you know other oil crops are far less efficient requiring far more deforestation elsewhere?
5496 2018-12-20 15:48:01 Saudi is one of our two most important allies in the Middle East, the biggest weapon market for the military-industrial-complex(MIC). As an ally, we give our domestic oil market to Saudi and keep the market away from Alberta oil. The geopolitics works out for MIC.
5497 2018-12-20 15:47:48 Exactly!  I was just thinking that each of my adolescent nieces and nephews would truly appreciate a case of 6 quarts of Mobil One oil because i can have it by Saturday.
5498 2018-12-20 15:47:42 "Instant gratification"?
Yes, voters are just children who want candy and unicorns. 
Let's just give Dems another generation, maybe wages will increase. Give them another century, maybe then they'll stop voting for record military budgets and oil & gas industry subsidies.
5499 2018-12-20 15:47:31 Bio oil brp ?
5500 2018-12-20 15:47:30 Really depends on what you’re painting. Painting people I felt oil paint was better for that. But oil dries slow, some ppl don’t like that. Acrylic is easy. It’s still good for whatever you want to paint whether people or abstract, I would go for acrylic first.
5501 2018-12-20 15:47:29 Blame the oil execs making millions even after all these layoffs. Oil prices dropped world wide & are still low. Our oil is expensive to extract. You think a pipeline will fix all the problem but it won't. Plus, you're asking a PM to interfere in a court ruling?
5502 2018-12-20 15:47:28 I actually got this mix from my loctician . It’s a mix of black castor oil, peppermint oil, and coconut oil. Put mostly black castor oil, half of that amount of coconut oil, and a quarter or less  of that amount of peppermint oil.
5503 2018-12-20 15:47:26 Do u have anointing oil?
5504 2018-12-20 15:47:23 I just want Blake and Yang to beat the shit out of him already so we can stop talking about him 
5505 2018-12-20 15:47:17 I will like to know the analysts. Oil prices are six week forward contracts, which means today's prices are what offtakers will pay in six weeks. Oil price today is $56 per barrel for February deliveries. Why are we planning $60 per barrel?
5506 2018-12-20 15:47:13 4. Salad dressing! Even healthy ones contain a lot of fat and sugar, just try some fresh squeezed lemon, a tsp of olive oil, salt and pepper. 
5. Energy/Protein bars: most are loaded with artificial flavorings, refined flours, and with lots of sugars.

5510 2018-12-20 15:46:59 How about the land we fought so hard to take from ISIS and now we're giving to Russia and Assad. How about we with SDF hold most of the oil in Syria that we're now giving to Russia. How about our allies SDF will get slaughtered by Turkey. Follow clueless people and be clueless.
5511 2018-12-20 15:46:52 Exactly. It was never "stop killing our own soldiers and innocent civilians for oil" its "listen to your military leaders who happen to be shareholders in arms companies and defense contractors." Ppl like u are the reason I have to say "im on the left, but i havent lost my mind."
5512 2018-12-20 15:46:43 First “ why is it ending? “ is a RHETORICAL question. Only an idiot would think ending electric car supplements in 2018 is a good idea. It can easily be extended. It has everything to do with trump and corrupt republicans who are handmaidens to oil companies.
5513 2018-12-20 15:46:41 Can I assume that truffle oil popcorn will be included?
5514 2018-12-20 15:46:40 Is the best way for us to secure our homes to build a 30 foot wall? We will need to change municipal zoning to make that work. Can we also use cannons, burning oil, spears, & moats?  I’m feeling secure already. Good to go.#GoFundTheWall #BoneSpurShouldResign
5515 2018-12-20 15:46:36 And were does western oil go. It is exported. It doesnt come to eastern Canada. And if we do nothing about omissions we wont have a country to worry about. The generation that is coming into adulthood are the ones changing our energy .So blame who you want but this is life
5516 2018-12-20 15:46:36 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?
5517 2018-12-20 15:46:32 Louisiana is very different from Mississippi. It's actually one of the richer states due to the oil and gas sector. I agree Mississippi is a different issue. I think it's the poorest state.
5518 2018-12-20 15:46:26 Sana oil.

5521 2018-12-20 15:46:02 Oil sickles.......  and fill totes. There are actually companies that will come buy it but you need some quantity and it needs to be clean. No anti freeze or water. Also. Where ever you buy your oil from is legally required to take your used oil back. Last I knew
5522 2018-12-20 15:45:57 Saudi is one of our two most important allies in the Middle East, the biggest weapon market for the military-industrial-complex(MIC). As an ally, we give our domestic oil market to Saudi and keep the market away from Alberta oil. The geopolitics works out for MIC.

5530 2018-12-20 15:45:20 I worked in the oil fields. Random testing, testing at hire, and testing after incidents are common.

5540 2018-12-20 15:44:03 Climate change is a snake oil ruse. There is no scientific experiment that proves the greenhouse effect. Bill Nye’s and Mythbusters’ are explained away with specific heat capacity. A bottle and a car are solid objects. There is no science experiment.
5541 2018-12-20 15:43:55 People don't understand that there is a larger picture with regard to Russia. For decades they have had a relationship where Syria is a primary support for them exporting oil. It is about their economy. Fake news paints it as aggression. Putin not innocent, yet country 1st.
5542 2018-12-20 15:43:43 He convinced public servants in Cali-fucking-fornia to waive environmental review and to let him use public funds to build a road solely for use by his other company’s cars.

I guess that took smarts? Also lol what’s antitrust
5543 2018-12-20 15:43:43 What does #agtwitter do with all its used oil?    We had a guy that came and picked it up.   But now we have nothing.   Gotta get rid of it somewhere.
5544 2018-12-20 15:43:39 Another fiver says Gov will panic spend millions on one or more of the snake oil drone defence systems that don't.
5545 2018-12-20 15:43:38 This move of OPEC & Russia will take crude prices a bit higher; which will result in increase of one million barrel daily shale oil extraction in USA in next one year.
OPEC is indirectly helping shale oil companies

5553 2018-12-20 15:43:02 There are billion dollar opportunities here. Minerals gas oil lithium etc.  So they want to be close monitoring the political situation and when the time is right , act accordingly.  We are of national interest to uncle Sam

5555 2018-12-20 15:42:51 I haven’t looked for weather stats yet for 2018 but in 2012 the low oil content was low and they blamed it on warmer than usual temps, especially nighttime temps, and variable moisture, both too much and too little. More diseases were present that year as well.
5556 2018-12-20 15:42:44 He’s always been known to hire illegal immigrants for Mar-a-lago and building projects, not to mention his “model agency” back in the day.  You’re really naive to believe this snake oil salesman man.
5557 2018-12-20 15:42:35 Oh no, not more worthless CNN. That rag not even worthy to catch oil from a dripping oil pan
5558 2018-12-20 15:42:30 Why dont we just pull the troops out of everywhere else in the world and focus our military on helping ourselves. Like leave em in syria so we can keep stealing oil but thad about it.

5561 2018-12-20 15:42:16 I really don't care about crucifying Iran either, tbh. This is all a sideshow. Our biggest geo-political opponent at the moment is clearly China, but we're dicking around in the Mideast when we're not even all that dependent on their oil any more. It's insanity.
5562 2018-12-20 15:42:12 No more wars for oil! You don't really care about so called allies, now do ya?
5563 2018-12-20 15:42:12 Don't feel threatened, you've not disputed the 152M. You lie though, the report was released in February this year 2018, they only referenced/compared other indices that had to do with the economy in 16/17 eg oil price, GDP etc. Please read be commenting

5575 2018-12-20 15:41:19 Agree mate, Djeno cos will increase just like mengo has since its mirroring the geo model and R1/2/3 hit. Offshore oil drilled from onshore, cheap costs and mega upside. This is the ONLY share to be in now. #AAOG with 104 up straight after as well.

Affluenza kept Ken clear.
5578 2018-12-20 15:40:56 Yeah man, lets just do 2008 all over again. Run it back, it worked out great for everyone! Vote for our piece of shit who still does the bidding of big oil and doesn't care if your children boil alive on the husk planet they leave behind!
5579 2018-12-20 15:40:50 Les grands dirigeants des entreprises de "Big Oil" ont fait plein d'argent en livrant du pétrole aux régimes d'hitler et de mussolini, l'argent n'a pas d'odeur et les businessmen sont des fous d'argent.

The only reason she is pretending to want it now is she’s pandering for votes in the upcoming election. Funny how all of a sudden she’s converted from the anti oil cult to be pro oil.

5599 2018-12-20 15:39:00 See? The government of USA does not support an average Ukrainians, but the criminals in the government of Ukraine who control Ukraine. UK started Israel and the  war of Middle East. The USA support them. 
Raw oil is the 'democracy' of the USA, Russia, UK, EU.
5600 2018-12-20 15:38:59 I can see your point. That's just not how I would choose to frame it for our readers. I think saying the Saudis are cutting more oil than planned implies there is a new level beyond the previously announced level of 10.2M. But again, that's an editorial choice.
5601 2018-12-20 15:38:54 It’s like getting an oil change. All of a sudden you notice the car driving a little smoother. However, sometimes I’m scared to pop the ball out as the studios are communal, and you never know what’s underneath.

5603 2018-12-20 15:38:51 Shares of energy companies largely missed out on a oil rally in the first nine months of the year. The SP500 energy sector peaked in May, with a year-to-date gain of 8.6%, when oil was trading at about $70 a barrel. ..

5605 2018-12-20 15:38:49 USA won't repeat a withdrawal like in Saigon. OpSec and PerSec first. Oil fields are Syrian property.
5606 2018-12-20 15:38:46 Or is this a balanced level where it is supposed to be? If you average out since the beginning of oil price statistics - revert to mean might not be so wrong?

Don't claim "free-market" by removing #Renewables subsidies but keeping very old and mature Fossil Fuel subsidies on the table. 
Trillions in #tax write-offs keep oil on the table.
Say what you mean and pull both, then watch renewables take over!
5609 2018-12-20 15:38:40 Dirtier air/water, public lands sold for oil, endangered species written off, autocrats given free rein to ignore human rights, journalism threatened around the world, democracies losing ground worldwide, Russia hacking/assassinating with impunity. @GOP #PutinsTraitorInChief

5614 2018-12-20 15:38:17 Should Pakistan take loans from IMF and agrees to increase oil, gas , electricity prices. Devalues rupee, slows the growth rate, increases inflation then it’s all okay.

5618 2018-12-20 15:38:10 #POTUS believes zero interest rates, no taxes, & $20/barrel oil is some sort of “strong economy” scenario. When banks don’t make money on loans, taxes aren’t there to support infrastructure & services, & #US oil companies can’t profit & file bankruptcy, that is not “greatness.”
5619 2018-12-20 15:38:05 with that big old contract boosters gave ole Jimbo - im guessing they are slightly puckered with the price of oil doing what its done in the last several months

5621 2018-12-20 15:37:59 Only condemnation!
Boycott Western products, make Islamic business zone, stop oil and activate Islamic forces

5623 2018-12-20 15:37:42 If you’re real & not a Putin plant, then you’re setting yourself up for an earthshaking disillusionment. You’ve been taken in by a huckster with all the ethics of a 19th Century snake oil salesman. In time you’ll discover that complex issues do not bend to simple solutions.
5624 2018-12-20 15:37:25 Oil industry much more stubborn than this prediction.  Industry will ensure they hit production averages first so Jan production probably increases.  Rule of thumb - ensure production guidance demonstrated before dropping rigs.

5628 2018-12-20 15:37:09 Not exactly. The reason the rainforest is being decimated for palm oil is that it grows well there but wouldn’t in a dryer more northern climate. Sunflowers on the other hand are more hardy & can be grown in a variety of climates. They are non-GMO & native to the US.
5629 2018-12-20 15:37:02 Trump asked for low oil price and low oil price indeed

5640 2018-12-20 15:36:23 True, Alberta’s frustration is legitimate, but at the same time we’ve had decades knowing that betting one thing to be our source of wealth, jobs everything.
Rather than mad about it, now is the time to diversify our energy sources so we don’t have to do this whenever oil tanks
5641 2018-12-20 15:36:20 Ukraine, Georgia, Israel, Kazakhstan, Afghanistan, Qatar, Tibet, Iran. And what is inside the circle? Raw oil? Really? So 'democratic' country the USA wants raw oil of middle East. 9/11? Gaddafi and raw oil of North Africa.
5642 2018-12-20 15:36:15 นั่นนะสิแปลว่าอะไร รบกวนแปลให้หน่อยได้มั้ยคะ อยากรู้

Anywayyy,be careful when choosing argan oil. Some of my customers show me 'so called pure argan oil' but the ingredients including fragrance. Pure argan oil has nutty fragrance and should be sold in dark colored bottle.
5647 2018-12-20 15:35:53 We have seen no evidence ExxonMobil's support for said regulations, whereas we have decades of evidence of the API acting as a more aggressive proxy for US oil and gas and in particular Exxon.

5657 2018-12-20 15:35:32 Oil is going to zero. Solar and wind energy are simply cheaper. And battery storage cost already 80% lower then 10 years ago.

5668 2018-12-20 15:34:41 Of course they are happy! You gave Putin what’s he’s wanted for years. Dominance over 1/2 of Middle East Oil & control over shipping in the area! Turkey will kill Kurds, Allow ISIS free hand! You removed Sanctions fro 2 Russian Companies! TRAITOR LIAR FRAUDSTER! IMPEACH 
5669 2018-12-20 15:34:31 Our oil is going to tide water now!
The UN says that landlocked countries are entitled to access to a coast. That access isn't unlimited & it doesn't guarantee which coast & how you get there. If you think building a pipeline will be easier as a seperate country you're delusional

5673 2018-12-20 15:34:15 Can Vitamins Treat Hormonal Acne?
. 
B5, also known as pantothenic acid, limits oil production in the sebaceous glands of the skin, a common cause of acne.
. 
Testosterone causes these glands to produce more oil, so vitamin B5 reverses this process, without counteracting any
5674 2018-12-20 15:34:15 Fish oil?
No I haven't. Recommend one
5675 2018-12-20 15:34:15 As a vegan I am trying my best to avoid all palm oil because of mass habitat destruction. I am also trying my best to become more aware of all products & where they come from. I'm simplifying everything. Replacing quinoa with barley etc. Least harm where possible 
5676 2018-12-20 15:34:11 I see some E&P names green with oil down 3%

5679 2018-12-20 15:33:58 It’s clear to most western Canadians, we are getting a raw deal via Trudeau/Legault. They reject our oil and hold their hands out for cash. They import foreign oil thru the St. Lawrence and reject ours. Are you going to buy Quebec products? I’m not

5687 2018-12-20 15:33:13 I heard that personal data, is the new oil. Oil has a direct affect on our economy. Our personal data are being brought and sold. We are being tracked for marketing because of our data. Soon we will be tracked when we buy something from a physical store with #rfid #smarttags
5688 2018-12-20 15:33:07 @GasBuddy why would you report gas prices spiked (25 cents in one day in Aurora, Il) due to a bump in oil futures?  They "bumped" to $52 a barrel. Have gone down 10 cents since, at $46 a barrel...

5702 2018-12-20 15:31:31 No, we’re truly scared of four more years of Trump. Hence our concerns about Beto, which do include (but also go beyond) whether or not he has ties to the oil and gas industry.
5703 2018-12-20 15:31:30 No matter what he believes in his little cocoon, he is the problem NOT the solution, HIS political meddling has created most of the issues that have befallen Alberta, low oil prices CAN have been weathered under different conditions without Liberal Hostility to Alberta!!!

5711 2018-12-20 15:30:52 We get OIL. If you were a real businessman or actually read anything, you'd know that.

5732 2018-12-20 15:29:26 True. Our oil is more ethically sourced. However, it is just as bad if not worse for the environment due to the extraction and refining process. What is your solution to the climate crisis? How do you propose to balance the oil sector with environmental sustainability?
5733 2018-12-20 15:29:24 Got spiced mulled white wine and Scotts Pine essential oil in my burner. Cancels are lit and I got a new book abou Witchcraft to read.
5734 2018-12-20 15:29:20 You poor folks. Open your eyes. 

Trump can't win - he pulls troops and everyone is upset and says he is doing in for Russia. Btw, he is arming Ukraine. Does that help Russia? 

If we stay in Syria, you all would say he's doing it for power and oil.
5735 2018-12-20 15:29:15 We need to check shelves if there is any oil left
5736 2018-12-20 15:29:14 Another way you can say it is Canadian oil is the most carbon heavy oil you can buy.  Oh wait that’s not the same.

5738 2018-12-20 15:29:08 My point is that the headline is inaccurate and misleading. The Saudis will not cut more oil than planned. They will aim to cut 10.2 million bpd. Which is what Falih said on Dec. 7. Barkindo's comment in the doc shows the Saudis will cut exactly as much as they planned.

5740 2018-12-20 15:28:57 Vladimir Putin pulling US troops out of Syria is not a bad thing. We're not getting any oil out of it, therefore it's a waste of time. Bring our troops home Vladimir. #Treason #SyriaWithdrawal
5741 2018-12-20 15:28:55 Syria doesn’t have any oil.
5742 2018-12-20 15:28:54 Very good for an oil importer like India.
5743 2018-12-20 15:28:53 Sometimes we are inconvenienced by fellow human beings experiencing something. Nisku is a hub of oil & gas services and it makes sense for them to demonstrate there.
5744 2018-12-20 15:28:52 Not necessarily. There are so many other factors...
For example, do you chew with your mouth closed? Maintain good foot health? Use patchouli oil? Floss? Also, floss your teeth?

5755 2018-12-20 15:28:01 You understand crude oil and want to link with petroleum products but common people don't understand this. They only understand the petrol price which is stable in the last 5 years. So common man are suffering which is a illusion of twitter Congress eco system

5764 2018-12-20 15:27:21 Can I be blunt? I believe this parable is about the importance of true believing Biblical eschatology. The foolish virgins obviously believed they had enough oil or they would have brought extra and not been found foolish.

5789 2018-12-20 15:25:29 Fracking in the US has made oil prices uncontrollable by OPEC. Oil is priced in $ around the world. The strong $ caused a rise in oil prices against many currencies. This combined with a global economic slowdown has crushed demand & caused a glut of oil.

GERMANY is creating a crises 4 the future with their self-interests.
5803 2018-12-20 15:24:18 Infrastructure?

Kerch bridge and new metro ring-line for Moscow jump to mind.

As for oil/gas, these price fluctuations affect all hydrocarbon exporters. I'd be more worried by the debt that supports  fracking. Those wells just don't deliver good ROI.
5804 2018-12-20 15:24:12 I think it's time to boycott these entities until they come 2 their senses. 15kg potatoes is $11.chicken is $12. Oil is $6. I'm trying 2 figure how a 1piecer & chips can cost $7?!??! Let alone, I'm buying soft drink in a bottle for 60c at local shops how does theirs cost 3.50??
5805 2018-12-20 15:24:11 Here is some news for you, Russia, Iran and Syria have been our enemies for decades. What happened when Iraq's oil industry was shut down during the wars.? Other producers pumped additional crude to help offset the price increases. We never benefited from Syrian oil.

5813 2018-12-20 15:23:32 One odd thing I often give to the homeless or tell them about is coconut oil. 1/4 a teaspoon rubbed into their feet does an amazing job of cutting down the bacteria that happens when you only have one pair of shoes. The lauric acid in it kills some fungi and viruses as well

5815 2018-12-20 15:23:29 I like how the words "Oil" and "Petroleum" are so stained with negativity that you guys co-opted the word "Energy" to describe yourselves anymore.

You're not oil companies. You are energy companies. lol

Then you dump less than 1% of oil profits into a windmill somewhere.

5823 2018-12-20 15:22:15 i agree. the issue is govt really... the policy could be great but the implementation half hearted, corrupted or distorted. so whats the plan.. remember we can only import as long as there is oil money to pay for such.. no?
5824 2018-12-20 15:22:12 The SAA don't have enough manpower to control the SDF-held area, even if the group agree to this, the most reasonable arrangement will be allowing the SAA+Russian forces to deploy in: 
-Former U.S. bases 
-Border with Turkey 
-West of Manbij
-Oil\Gas fields

5840 2018-12-20 15:20:33 The reason for US meddling in that region was access to oil. Now that we have our own oil, it's time to get out and let the locals play in their sandbox by themselves.

5842 2018-12-20 15:20:19 @catholiccharis7 Irving Oil imports Saudi Oil. Neither Trudeau nor any Canadian government is in the business of importing oil. We are a capitalist country, not a dictatorship. If you have a beef with KSA imports, take it up with the Irvings, not the government.

5844 2018-12-20 15:20:09 But that’s the thing, oil companies in Alberta are heavily incentivized to stay already. The companies themselves are making tons of money, and Canada isn’t seeing the types of benefits that other oil producing countries get. The oil is not going anywhere so where would they go?

5847 2018-12-20 15:19:47 They will be happy. They want control of the region, then they will control the majority of the oil. ISIS still exists, that is a lie. They are primarily being fought by the Kurds with US military support. Iran, Syria and Russia will attack the Kurds once the US is gone.

5930 2018-12-20 15:11:35 Boleh tak someone suggest few product cleansing oil sesuai utk sensitive skin? Yg tak ada mineral oil. 
5931 2018-12-20 15:11:30 Two years! That's the amount of time that republicans had control of of all branches! And now you put on this show like your a crusader? Your all con men selling snake oil to the rubes that actually wait on line to buy it!
5932 2018-12-20 15:11:27 Somebody show me where #Q said to send the money because we've all been getting our "snake oil" for free. Whoopsie!
5933 2018-12-20 15:11:25 @BAP_Bangyongguk @BAP_Himchan @BAP_Daehyun @BAP_Youngjae @BAP_Jongup @ZELO96 Goodnight 
5934 2018-12-20 15:11:23 First,,You have to cam to the understanding that, destiny cannot be changes through oil.
5935 2018-12-20 15:11:14 I'm going to speculate that his big news was a water powered car, and he's late because he's been abducted by agents of Big Oil. 90% chance of car chase, followed by being chased down a hallway by a fiery explosion. Because that's probably more exciting than traffic.
5936 2018-12-20 15:11:08 The Cafe Mac Pizza for dinner today will be: undercooked crust with chunky motor oil and ham.
5937 2018-12-20 15:11:03 Sirota is Bernie’s hitman .... nothing to see here. Was like the crap he put out 2 weeks ago that Beto takes all this oil money when it was from individual donors that just happen to work in the oil industry in Texas . Of which there are many, many, many....
5938 2018-12-20 15:11:02 Nakakawalang gana na mag mang inasal simula noong nawala yung chicken oil nila parang wala nang thrill kumain???
5939 2018-12-20 15:10:57 Well the gap has since been filled and then some. Need Oil to stabilize
5940 2018-12-20 15:10:57 Tarte Amazonian Clay! & it’s non oil based so your face stays matte for 8 hours, I don’t even touch mine up.
5941 2018-12-20 15:10:51 Ma ci pensate a tuna oil che romperà il cazzo fino al 31 con Baselli?
5942 2018-12-20 15:10:49 Not yet. Still needs half a stick of butter and three tablespoons of MCT oil.
5943 2018-12-20 15:10:42 First day of break and I’m getting my oil changed. Ah, adulting.
5944 2018-12-20 15:10:38 Mr. President, the Russians are preparing for a move into the Middle East. That is why they moved into the Crimea and into Syria. The Russians want to control oil in the Mid East and we must protect Yemen and IRAQ with US ground troops to prevent a Russian invasion.
5945 2018-12-20 15:10:35 A good use. Looking for the urbanists interested in building power to shift away from highway spending versus trolling left as SUV lovers and conceive of how to organize coalitions strong enough to challenge roads and oil & gas.
5946 2018-12-20 15:10:33 Car be running so smooth after an oil change
5947 2018-12-20 15:10:25 An oil pipeline just got approval to run under Lake Erie--what will we do when they pollute the largest collective bodies of the world's fresh water?
5948 2018-12-20 15:10:23 Can you summarize? Sirota blocked me for complaining about the slanted, seeming smear of O’Rourke vis a vis the “oil industry” contributions.  Was that 400k from the “industry” or from small money donor employees?  

You’ve got interesting friends, Matt.
5949 2018-12-20 15:10:19 Getting an oil change.
5950 2018-12-20 15:10:13 It’s prob just me but I reaaaaaally really dislike the texture. It feels so greasy, like I’m putting actual oil on my lips

5955 2018-12-20 15:09:57 U are a liar, Atiku, what happened during ur join ticket with OBJ since 1999-2007? U could have done it then, since that time Nigeria has a sound crude oil revenue generation, with less commitment. But u ended in buildings ur private schools, business ventures etc. SAI BABA
5956 2018-12-20 15:09:53 A sell out of my perfume oil stock. Dm me
5957 2018-12-20 15:09:52 I need an oil change. Dealing with car shit really depresses me. I’m so lost
5958 2018-12-20 15:09:44 India’s aim is to become a strong voice of consumers in influencing global energy markets for a balance and responsible price. #ModiGovernment is also committed to ensure energy security of our country and focusing on importing oil & gas at competitive prices.
5959 2018-12-20 15:09:44 Several large oil and gas/chemical companies supported Waxman Markey in 2009. Most of the majors supported the Paris Climate Accord.
5960 2018-12-20 15:09:32 Another fool diluting the information and clouding the truth. What are a you doing here fool, this is a dialogue for the victims of global foreign policy that attempted to slaughter the inhabitants of 7 independent Arab states surrounding the oil fields and Israel
5961 2018-12-20 15:09:31 The story sounds like the food reward concept to me?  Fried food comment is interesting.  I doubt Hunter gather had deep fryers but I bet they eat most of the drippings off the meat. Fried processed see oil?
5962 2018-12-20 15:09:10 Instead of taking on Trump & Republicans he attacks Democrats.  So...as Bernie is a Ru asset I will back who he rails against. Btw. My husband is a retired oil field worker and we donated to Beto Senate run
5963 2018-12-20 15:08:59 Also fun fact jojoba oil is pronounced as hoe-hoe-ba oil.
5964 2018-12-20 15:08:58 After doctors putting pain meds in my hand, I started to investigate. On my own I decided to use Hemp Extract, & in just a few days the pain from arthritis has lessen. CBD oil is also good for your body, pain & skin, sleep, anxiety, Ck it out nothing to lose & you may feel better
5965 2018-12-20 15:08:57 Omg sis jdnfbnfnfnf
Yes kena emulsify dulu. Then baru senang remove the oil residue from the cleansing oil.
5966 2018-12-20 15:08:56 Last I checked, US total inventories have drawn bigly by some 25 MM barrels in 3 weeks. This oil price drop is unjustified

5969 2018-12-20 15:08:40 IF IF oil can rally , we my see nice oversold bounce and Last week of the year rally.
Im long till im not anymore..LOTS of R/G today . Besides actually rally we could also get the short squeeze .
Merry Christmas
5970 2018-12-20 15:08:39 The goal is to use the hot oil on both sides to give it a nice crispy exterior with the flour
5971 2018-12-20 15:08:29 I agree pipelines are not safe, let’s invest in renewable technologies & leave the fossil fuels in the ground, that way we can circumvent the whole pipeline issue; however this probably won’t happen b/c there is too much big oil $’s in Alberta... it’s not about us it’s about them
5972 2018-12-20 15:08:22 Also I hear 3% of his campaign donations came from people in the oil & Gas industry. Discuss.
5973 2018-12-20 15:08:08 Спасибо)) На сампо скачаю, и, наверное, в пятницу начну.
5974 2018-12-20 15:08:00 I mix the oil and butter in the pan first whilst I season the pork chops myself. Haven't put flour on them before I may try that next time I make pork chops.

5983 2018-12-20 15:07:04 True. Rationality and politics are like oil and water.
5984 2018-12-20 15:07:04 Why??? This man does not explain how "Alberta country" will get oil to markets any better than it would as part of Confederation. Landlocked,  needs new currency, new govt, lose land bc of treaties, etc. It's nice to bluster. It's another thing 2 make it work. Look at Brexit.
5985 2018-12-20 15:06:53 It’s an oil pipeline
5986 2018-12-20 15:06:51 My baby cousins are dealing with me today. Coconut oil on the floor, lipgloss on my face, whole room a mess

5988 2018-12-20 15:06:50 I see... when Alberta is successful and exporting a lot...the revenues stay in Alberta... no PST, highest wages in Canada, etc....
BUT. when Alberta is not profiting.....  Other Provinces have to PAY ALBERTA $2/barrel of Oil bought ELSEWHERE!
Not Likely!

5991 2018-12-20 15:06:33 Will Alberta build refineries and start diversifying the economy by building oil manufacturing plants like Koch brothers Invista ie plastics?  Why merely export so others manufacture?

5996 2018-12-20 15:05:52 For pork i find butter as the key cooker, i rub some all purpose flour on it, heat the oil up and mix the butter in during the cooking after yeeting it over once

5998 2018-12-20 15:05:47 Oil and/or regime change. Didn't turn out well for Sadam or Ghaddfi. Im tired of wars that do nothing but take our blood & treasure. If we are attacked I have no problem with my sons fighting otherwise I want no part in the middle east.
5999 2018-12-20 15:05:45 The price of the product dropped because it less desirable to refiners than other products, and we're in a serious over supply situation. So oil companies have slowed production and exploration.  The plan is blame the Federal Govt and  cause traffic problems?
6000 2018-12-20 15:05:31 better take a hot bath w eucalyptus oil, epsom sea salt and chamomile
6001 2018-12-20 15:05:20 When you go in for an oil change or a battery replacement, I assure you your engine filter is shot, axles are bent, and engine is on fire.

6004 2018-12-20 15:05:02 How can olive oil be virgin
6005 2018-12-20 15:05:01 Those tomatoes are too beautiful to treat that way. Just a little olive oil, salt, and pepper. No mayo required. No bread unless it's artisanal and crusty and only for sopping the tomato juices.
6006 2018-12-20 15:04:57 Why are you hijacking a thread about pipelines to post your anti oil sands, anti Alberta opinions? (Just an FYI, it is considered very rude to hijack someones thread)
6007 2018-12-20 15:04:52 Let's expand the sample size then. 

When has the oil industry actively supported climate legislation that would cut demand for its main product? 

How much money has been spent electing candidates who are climate deniers because they will attack the industry?
6008 2018-12-20 15:04:52 Oil change and new brakes if possible today and signing up fo a gym  let’s go

6010 2018-12-20 15:04:49 Western governments led by the US have protected the Saudi regime since an agreement was struck on the USS Quincy between FDR and the Saudi king in 1945.

In the decades since, Saudi oil has powered the Western lifestyle in exchange for absolute support of the monarchy.

6012 2018-12-20 15:04:43 Perhaps this is an indication of the way a majority of Canadians feel about environmental disasters? Most people don't actually work in #oil and #gas....#abpoli #cdnpoli #pipedream #poisonisreal

6015 2018-12-20 15:04:34 It’s so stupid players can’t smoke or take CBD oil. But hey let’s make them take opiates like skittles that’s much better. Idiots man. Idiots.
6016 2018-12-20 15:04:33 Come on the Earth and the environment can’t afford to take all that oil out especially fracking . Millions of people are already getting sick and dying from fossil fuel pollution. Green jobs are and will replace the dirty oil jobs this is the way of the future not the past.
6017 2018-12-20 15:04:29 Also everyone in that club who paid with their dollars to see and encourage an underage child to perform should have all been arrested. This was in New York, is this another example of NY values? No wonder they elected olive oil to be their Senator.
6018 2018-12-20 15:04:21 You don't need to. Just coat the pan with some oil and butter and yeet them bitches on there. Flip occasionally and they're ready to eat in about 15-20 minutes.
6019 2018-12-20 15:04:18 Not the same as oil but the concept is the same. Look at a pipeline map and see how many there actually are. Compare pipeline incidents to rail and decide which has most negative impact. Rail issues every day but they keep those quiet
6020 2018-12-20 15:04:13 The United States of America has a Russian President.  Every thing he does, if studied through the perspective of "How does this help Russia?" is easily explained. China Trade War, Iran Oil Embargo, Shun EU, Attack allies, Embrace tyrants, Ignore Ukraine, HELP RUSSIA.

6024 2018-12-20 15:03:56 Oil diay oy hahaha
6025 2018-12-20 15:03:54 They still are looting resources, undermining countries' ability to feed their own people, by forcing them to import bulk Ag commodities in return for oil. 
Shocking that Nigeria with vast arable land should be net importer of rice.

6037 2018-12-20 15:03:06 So… you’re saying it’s just like here where I am since Harper fucked Canadian manufacturing with his high dollar policy to support equipment purchases for the oil industry? That’s been happening here for over a decade now. Stop whining.

6059 2018-12-20 15:01:32 Tariffs on China are over due. China has committed to dropping tariffs on US cars and oil, it appears to be working. Will tariff war create some short term pain??..sure, but often times you have to have pain to prosper. Can’t let China continue to enrich itself at our expense.
6060 2018-12-20 15:01:25 Why are you done stealing our oil? Did you empty it out?
6061 2018-12-20 15:01:21 The GOP really knows how to pick’em. They have given us an Oil President, a War President and now a Russian President. Who’ll be next, an Alien Space Invader who wants to destroy the human race from the planet Voltron? #lockhimup #DumpTrump #russianpuppet #demolishthegop
6062 2018-12-20 15:01:20 My oil change place used to play some weird channel called something like Freedom One and it was like ersatz news. Looked it up and yup it was a conservative-owned propaganda station.
6063 2018-12-20 15:01:12 Trump betrays his excuse for breaking with Iran Nuclear Deal by surrendering to Assad in Syria and gives sphere of influence to Russia.  Renewed oil embargo on Iran helps Russia as well.  If you study all Trump's foreign policy is best studied as how it helps Russia.

6070 2018-12-20 15:00:35 It's not on some website. It's on a website known to massively spread lies and profiting from selling various "snake oil" products. They say we can't trust studies because Big Pharma while happily taking anything from clearly for-profit page for granted.
6071 2018-12-20 15:00:33 I think it's the dry air. Every time I fly, I have to carry oil absorbing wipes and some of those neutrogena pink grapefruit face wipes to keep my face feeling okay.

6079 2018-12-20 14:59:32 Crude oil causing the divergence??

6083 2018-12-20 14:59:15 Like olive oil and calamari...You don't know what you're putting in your mouth. It could be pig ani or squid.
6084 2018-12-20 14:58:59 Oil.

If the Middle East goes to pieces, everyone who buys petroleum from the Arabs will start buying from sources that we buy from & the prices will skyrocket.

That's only if countries don't start fighting over it.

6093 2018-12-20 14:58:19 Come on guys. It gets national attention. Everyone knows we are pro oil but if you haven't noticed it's not just oil workers being affected here its everyone.

6098 2018-12-20 14:58:00 This guy truly is the greatest snake oil salesman to ever live.
6099 2018-12-20 14:58:00 May well cost more the retooling  to handle our oil would cost billions.
6100 2018-12-20 14:57:59 Idk what it is about airports, but I swear to god as soon as I step into one, all of the oil in my normally very nice skin starts seeping out of every pore. 
6101 2018-12-20 14:57:52 Historically, the funding for science obfuscation and against climate policy from the majors and broader industry has been exceptionally counter productive. Enviros see oil companies as the bad guys - they did just spend tens of millions killing a carbon price in WA
6102 2018-12-20 14:57:52 Ah ok, so what if I took the powder with a tbsp of Olive/Coconut Oil?
6103 2018-12-20 14:57:51 Great decision!!! We are tired of being everyone else's bodyguard. Plus, we realize that previous administrations only wanted to dominate those regions because of the oil.
6104 2018-12-20 14:57:48 Again, amazing what Trump has done with Dems, the media, the DOJ, CIA, FBI, the Fed and half the GOP in DC against him. Hot economy, jobs, deregulation, trade deals, tax reform, gas prices and reduced reliance on foreign oil, black unemployment, prison reform...ISIS.
6105 2018-12-20 14:57:37 I started adding coconut oil & cayenne to my detox tea let’s see how this works out
6106 2018-12-20 14:57:37 帰り際に玄関（？）を通り過ぎてトイレに向かいながら店員さん達にごちそうさまでしたって言ったのも忘れないで！！！
6107 2018-12-20 14:57:33 Great news, Rick!  I'm sure you can get some money funneled to your friends in Big Oil, and they will be very grateful and fill your pockets accordingly! This shows you're not dumb, as Trump says, but smart, like Trump, when he doesn't pay taxes!
6108 2018-12-20 14:57:26 He lied about ISIS? Didn't Obama say ISIS was the JV team and we didn't need to take them serious? And then proceeded to spend almost 4 years fighting them with very little result? It took Russia less than 1 year once they came to end the illegal oil trade ISIS had with Turkey
6109 2018-12-20 14:57:25 I don't get it.  Oil companies are the ones that need the pipelines.  All this is to get public money, political capitol, and apparently a bunch of truckers working for the benefit of failing oil company executives/shareholders whose largest problem is oversupply?
6110 2018-12-20 14:57:19 Court confirms €1.5 billion compensation for Prestige oil spill...
6111 2018-12-20 14:57:19 Isis isn’t defeated, they just lost their strong hold and a lot of members. If you pull our soldiers out of Syria, Isis will come back stronger than before, putin will move in, A-sad and China and many innocent lives will be lost. Russia will control the oil and China the water.
6112 2018-12-20 14:57:16 That too, I've said before that the oil and gas fumes must be getting to them!
6113 2018-12-20 14:57:15 FREE oil for everybody!!!

6117 2018-12-20 14:57:02 Turkey wants us to sell out the Kurds in exchange for easing up on Bonesaw. We’ll probably give them Gulen too.

Russia wins twice. Much tighter control of Syria and higher oil prices in the medium term.

No direct benefit to the US.

Graham’s trash all mouth SPINELESS!
6118 2018-12-20 14:57:01 Do you want to oil it for her. Last I checked I no get anybaunty Kemi please sir
6119 2018-12-20 14:57:01 Saudi Arabia is going to have to make some changes then, or implode. They cannot make their budget work at $40-50 oil, much less lower. The spring uprisings might become a full revolt in all the Middle East if the freebies are all cut off and austerity measures are implemented.
6120 2018-12-20 14:57:00 Face oil br moist
6121 2018-12-20 14:57:00 Yeah. Circumstances beyond your control, or the control of the feds, called the global price of oil rendering Alberta unable to compete with areas with lower lift costs and higher grade crude. Alberta could’ve invested their gains from this industry to develop but didn’t.
6122 2018-12-20 14:56:54 It is amazing how people don't understand the strategic value of Net export of oil by U.S.

We are no longer bound to protecting middle East oil supplies.
6123 2018-12-20 14:56:47 Why don't you stick to "fashion and beauty" and leave military and government issues to people who weren't stupid enough to sniff the throne of the snake oil salesman who fooled you idiots into thinking he was "smart".
6124 2018-12-20 14:56:44 Oil pooling chesthunnatundhi....
6125 2018-12-20 14:56:40 For what it’s worth, Premier Legault said that oil sands are dirty compared with HYDRO, not foreign oil. Are we going to punish everyone who tries to switch to renewables?

6128 2018-12-20 14:56:29 But Israel wants it's oil pipeline and America is supposed to be Israel's bitch and get it for them.

Also Syria has a national bank.  Can't have that.  Rothschild's need their global banking empire.
6129 2018-12-20 14:56:27 Uh, doesn't Alberta have the highest per capita income of any Canadian province? And the lowest provincial income tax rates. And no retail sales tax.
And I'm sorry about no pipelines. And we can't fix lo world oil prices.
6130 2018-12-20 14:56:25 저 굿즈산다고 좀 일찍갈것같아용!!

6132 2018-12-20 14:56:10 Moran’s is a genuine loss. Not to be lumped in with that dirty oil smell faux whatever half king.
6133 2018-12-20 14:55:52 Bio oil itu temennya bio diesel?
6134 2018-12-20 14:55:49 This is based on current methods of generation? Claims based on all else being equal.

Moving subsidies from oil/gas to renewable could shift that a lot.

Better yet, better public transport made free to use as Luxembourg has done could mean much less car use and lower emissions.
6135 2018-12-20 14:55:43 @narendramodi sir kisano ki lea urea, die,beej or keat jhotne ki lea oil ko kuch kam kar do kishan kush ho jayege.
6136 2018-12-20 14:55:35 No bc if u get any lil cuts then the oil will burn

6139 2018-12-20 14:55:20 Why even have a country if they cant step up and do something for themselves.. Spend some of that oil money for weapons and use them the right way instead of waiting on the good ole USA to police the world....
6140 2018-12-20 14:55:15 Speaking of fake news that’s a picture from Kavanaugh’s hearing. But Trump got it right this time. Bring them home unless we go to war with Assad 17 + years in Afghanistan n why r we still there? We no longer need their oil they have nothing else to offer so leave them to fight
6141 2018-12-20 14:55:13 I hope you're right but with the abundance of oil and ever decreasing cost of solar and wind,I really believe oil is going the way of coal, sooner than later.
6142 2018-12-20 14:55:05 Bar soap is just stripping the nutrients and good oil in your face, highly recommend a cleanser I use Dermalgoica, a little pricey but so worth it

50 - 40 lb bags to basementpellets sell by bag too
6147 2018-12-20 14:54:50 2.  You're paid to oppose Canadian oil

This one raises the spectre of "paid protesters" working for some shadowy American (usually) oil interests to landlock Canadian oil.  This appeals to the conspiracy theory crowd looking to avoid any debate over climate change.
6148 2018-12-20 14:54:46 Did you do it as part of double cleansing or just the oil?
6149 2018-12-20 14:54:44 Seriously it not saying one real concrete fact about trump. U went after his kid and paying 7$??? Like are u for real?? You cant name me one thing!! Trump will be remembered as great president. Boosted our economy. Protected our borders. USA is net oil exporter. New trade deals
6150 2018-12-20 14:54:35 Last time you distracted people with the keystone xl, the Dakotas were produced with 0 dissent.  But that’s what you get when Standard Oil runs big NGOs like 350.
6151 2018-12-20 14:54:32 American intervention in Syria was *never about* defeating ISIS. It was about appropriating the 50 billion barrel undeclared shale oil reserve in Syria. The "Iraq" template.
6152 2018-12-20 14:54:30 And how would a land locked country get their oil to market?
6153 2018-12-20 14:54:26 I can't believe all the negative comments about being inconvenienced by a protest. Park your cars shut the gas off in your house and shut up the phone your using could not be made without oil. #villageidiotsspeak

6160 2018-12-20 14:53:38 Do we really care?  With our new found oil independence should we really be concerned about this region as much?  Other than honoring agreements with Isreal I think Europe can send their sons to die here since they are so worried about it.
6161 2018-12-20 14:53:36 It’s a ghost fw y’all just get the church ppl to come by and pray and put some an anoinment oil on the walls you’ll be ok mines went away
6162 2018-12-20 14:53:35 Basket. 

That never ends well. 

Ask the Saudis right now. 

Contrast that with Norway and their “State Capitalism” model in which each citizen now has 200k held in a trust fund due to the government divesting their oil money in the stock market on behalf of citizens. It works.
6163 2018-12-20 14:53:34 tbh donghae looks so good with his long hair. the problem is his stylists. they shouldn't oil and perm his hair bc it makes him look like he hasn't taken a shower in weeks. 

donghae looks like a god in his hairstyle today. it's not oily + they didn't perm his bangs/fringe.
6164 2018-12-20 14:53:31 I think it depends on whether you believe we can go back to the past - it would be lovely to live in a Jill Stein fantasy land where America never intervenes and we all grow kale and have free health care -but we are oil hogs who colonized people and we have to deal with it.
6165 2018-12-20 14:53:27 I need a oil change and that’s some shit I’m not into I’ll let my car go over the miles like why I can’t just drive .

6167 2018-12-20 14:53:19 I want Big Oil to pay! 

They're the subsidized bad guys. Record profits every quarter since we rubbleized Iraq.
Whatever you mean by "revenue-neutral" I suspect it's a means to an at the pump tax that further burdens Joe & Jane Workerbees.
Subsidize Green/ Tax the guilty.

6168 2018-12-20 14:53:17 And yet you would like it to by higher  by putting regulations on the oil and gas industry.

6170 2018-12-20 14:53:08 Given the cumulative traffic disruptions over the years CP Rail was way ahead of the rest of the pack protesting the lack of pipelines to transport oil. Picture shows tanker cars are blocking traffic. Their gift to #yegtraffic
6171 2018-12-20 14:52:59 Your party led us there to try and manipulate oil. You Sec. of State is the absolute proponent of meddling in the Middle East. This tweet is misdirection on your part and a lie. You are a failure as a leader and a liar.
6172 2018-12-20 14:52:58 Showering everyday it’s bad for your hair but if you don’t shower everyday, the oil from your hair can make you breakout.
Wearing your hair back can be bad for your hair but if you don’t keep your hair back, the hair will touch your face & you’ll breakout 

ok so which is it.

Post WW2 the US was in the Middle East for the oil, and to contain the spread of Soviet influence.   1/2

Now, think if the Islam countries deny to provide oil to country?
Please try to be practical and analytical.
6188 2018-12-20 14:51:44 A waste of valuable time and resources. #conspicuousconsumption #abpoli #cdnpoli #pipedream #poisonisreal #oil
6189 2018-12-20 14:51:39 I agree with that.
Let the Arabs take care of their shit.
We should haver never taken out Saddam....he took care of the bad guys. Thanks Bush 1&2.
Had the Kuwaiti's not started stealing Iraq oil by cross drilling under the border.....there would have never been Isis

6192 2018-12-20 14:51:26 Obviously, a gas tax's most effective time to be levied would be when oil prices are low...like now. Small biz would, of course, pass the expense on to consumers...change, folks...get used to it.

6195 2018-12-20 14:51:22 You do realise what he referred to as 21st century socialism revolves around having the vast majority of business in Venezuela be privately owned. 

You should know, considering you are happy to talk on the issue, that their downfall came from putting all their eggs in the oil
6196 2018-12-20 14:51:21 it's actually baby oil, which was expensive so they were forced to use water for some shots which the materials didn't like as much.

6211 2018-12-20 14:50:27 You want USA out of the middle east because that was the agreement with Putin and Russia you know that he wants to be in Syria in the Middle East time to tell the truth Trump! Russia wants fleet access to the Mediterranean Sea for oil shipment and control of it!!
6212 2018-12-20 14:50:25 oil down 35%
US become exporter
So the fed want to rise rates in an enviroment of falling oil?
6213 2018-12-20 14:50:24 "in case anything else happens"

What like? The sudden need to invade an oil rich sovereign nation or something?
6214 2018-12-20 14:50:17 #crude oil slumps 3 percent, near lowest in a year as stock markets sink brent @55.69
6215 2018-12-20 14:50:15 That was in 1980s and at at 2015 oil constituted 90% of our foreign revenue. If anything happens to revenue of a monoeconomy it will collapse stop being bling to the truth it will take u nowhere.
6216 2018-12-20 14:50:14 Well my brothers worked in oil fields and left because they seen what was going on when Harper was in office. They know work in green energy.  So one fails move on that is what makes Canadians a strong stock of people. It is hard but ppl are moving away from fossil fuels.
6217 2018-12-20 14:50:05 Not that I agree, but the argument is that it maintains political stability with the middle East and stability helps production in those countries, namely Saudi Arabia. Increased production means decreased prices of good they export to America, namely oil.
6218 2018-12-20 14:49:58 The unwind of the #Dollar is the new best trade.  You had a hawkish fed yesterday but the long term maturities sold off. the 2 and 5 inverted, and #oil is selling even with the help of the lower Dollar. First half 2019 is low growth, slow to moderate inflation. Banks are toast.
6219 2018-12-20 14:49:52 It reminds me of how people used to tell me to put whatever oils on them while I was pregnant. It’s just genetics. I don’t have elastic skin. I could have swam in a bucket of coconut oil every day and I’d have the same marks.

6227 2018-12-20 14:49:09 Well... stopped out on a pullback on gbp/usd but I had the direction right as it’s now dropped a lot lower. Took profit on usd/jpy scalp and the Wall Street open. Oil keeps edging towards my stop but I’m going to let it play out and see what happens. Looking like a break even day
6228 2018-12-20 14:49:02 One simple solution: remove or slowly lower the incentives on oil. There is soooo much money going into big oil, without it, green energy would already be cheaper than oil.
6229 2018-12-20 14:48:56 Callie would need an oil change a couple days before Christmas  yea, no one getting presents this year 
6230 2018-12-20 14:48:46 I didn't know Syria had oil.
6231 2018-12-20 14:48:43 The unwind of the Dollar is the new best trade.

6235 2018-12-20 14:48:24 Small roads leading to old abandoned Wells (either oil or irrigation water)
6236 2018-12-20 14:48:21 target has Bio-Oil that is supposed to eliminate stretch marks! I use it for acne scarring but I’ve heard of a lot of people say it works great for stretch marks. It is an oil but abosorbs quick and never leaves my face oily
6237 2018-12-20 14:48:13 Why don’t YOU go to #Syria. We only invaded there to steal their resources just like #Iraq & their fictitious WMD’s. Their oil fields are run by SHELL & BP now. I dare you to fact check. Our gov’t lies us into all these evil murderous wars. #1984
6238 2018-12-20 14:48:10 Samsung RC090MHXEA air to water. Uses same pipework as previous oil fired CH with some small modifications. Needed to buy four higher-output rads and shift two to handle the lower water temperature. I find no need to boost hot water temperature for showers etc - it's hot enough.
6239 2018-12-20 14:48:08 Putin: the presence of the US troops in Syria is illegitimate: IT ALWAYS WAS ! SHOULDA NEVER BEEN A PHUK'N REPUBLICUNT FINANCIAL & "OIL" CORP "KOCH"-SUKKA REPUBLICUNT-RUN "PENNY-GONE" WAR !!
6240 2018-12-20 14:48:08 Yesterday Govt of Kerala has banned 75 different brands of coconut oil in the state after finding heavy adulteration, FDA of all state to wake up to counter these kind of menace
6241 2018-12-20 14:48:06 Because going right lost the dems 1000s of seats in gov ffs. Because appealing to republicans is disgusting when you have popular policies like single payer and ending the wars on your side but you instead take oil money and act as controled opposion to progress. Disgusting.
6242 2018-12-20 14:48:06 Drastic drop in Oil price cause and  will cause recesion in Nigeria as long as we still operate a monoeconomy, it has nothing to do with who is in power. Check my analogy because it holds true. Cheers

6244 2018-12-20 14:47:56 2) Kuwait war was us. Instead of drilling oil straight down we gave Kuwait new technology to drill sideways. They were drilling into Iraq territory stealing oil. Govt officials gained by that Why Saddam invaded Kuwait. Every single wars been started by corrupt govt. Bush 1992= UN
6245 2018-12-20 14:47:52 Might as well donate it to a TV evangelist, same snake oil.

6248 2018-12-20 14:47:31 Exactly, it's unavoidable imo, our government has even been selling off some reserves while oil is relatively high, people knew this is coming. If you look deep enough all the evidence is there.

6250 2018-12-20 14:47:23 It's not only about oil though...I'm not sure ppl in AB understand the consequences of splitting from Canada.  Do many really grasp what they're suggesting? I doubt it.
6251 2018-12-20 14:47:13 RT CNNBusiness: The Dow opened down 150 points Thursday after sinking sharply a day earlier. Crude oil was down more than 3% as bearish sentiment continues for the economy and demand. Altria fell 2% after buying a 35% stake in e-cigarette maker Juul. Watch live …

6254 2018-12-20 14:47:01 People really think oil changes are like 5min process like bro stop
6255 2018-12-20 14:46:59 As an integrated oil company, $HSE is one of three who benefited from low WCS prices. The other two are $SU and $IMO.
6256 2018-12-20 14:46:57 Check your Transmission oil this weekend.
6257 2018-12-20 14:46:57 I am sure most commenting on the article did not read it. The money went to states & Local govt. Even the oil producing states got their 13%. The painful thing is that Oil price is dropping & another is "it's election season" . Your guess is good as mine on fate of the funds
6258 2018-12-20 14:46:52 The intervention of the so-called "Western" powers in Syria had nothing to do with breaking up the jihadists - this was political cover for appropriation and theft of Syria's 50 billion barrels of undeclared shale oil reserves.

6260 2018-12-20 14:46:44 You think I am? You need to check your reading list on Iran and Kurds (as heterogeneous as they are) again. A tip here: have a look at Iran-Assad’s recent attack to seize oil fields under SDF control in Deir Ezzor, but I suspect your nationalism hampers sound realistic thinking.
6261 2018-12-20 14:46:42 Theres an essential oil I've used and its usually called defend or defense and it knocked my cold right out! It doesnt taste the greatest but it worked
6262 2018-12-20 14:46:32 I am sure most commenting on the article did not read it. The money went to states & Local govt. Even the oil producing states got their 13%.

6263 2018-12-20 14:46:32 The people who are gonna end up with most of the oil deals are probably Chinese companies. Also the YPG already has links with Russia, they used to be allied with the USSR after all. Problem is that many Kurds hate Assad and they resent Russia abandoning Afrin.
6264 2018-12-20 14:46:16 I wonder if cbd oil is considered one of those substances
6265 2018-12-20 14:46:12 Stretch mark remedies besides bio oil ? 
6266 2018-12-20 14:46:08 Szpitale województwa łódzkiego, dzięki OIL w Łodzi, również są plakatowane. Także Wrocław włącza się do działań,
Chociaż problem jest ogólnopolski, to terenem (fizycznego) działania dla @OILWarszawa jest województwo mazowieckie.
6267 2018-12-20 14:46:04 Try alternative of Kratom and CBD oil.
6268 2018-12-20 14:46:01 And the oil industry apologists would have you worry about the car you drive, or how you heat your home, or Al Gore's airplane trips, or David Suzuki's homes.  There are bigger issues like the expansion of the tar sands.
6269 2018-12-20 14:45:59 WTI oil at $46.66/barrel, -$1.15.
6270 2018-12-20 14:45:55 I have learned a lot over the last year  because of the snake oil salesman...Thanks Q, Thanks Anon's
6271 2018-12-20 14:45:42 You dont follow this very well. Beto is being pushed by the machine, thats the only reason anyone knows about him in the forst place. Guy is second in taking oil money ffs.
6272 2018-12-20 14:45:39 Absolute nonsense written by a left wing rag. World oil demand is up, production is up more & green energy has proven uneconomic & untrustworthy worldwide as country after country reverts to building coal fired power plants as the Paris agreement collapses! #YellowVests

6274 2018-12-20 14:45:19 In all fairness, just remember Obama cut heating oil subsidies to the poor and also cut back the SNAP program.

Then when Venezuela sent heating oil to people in the NE dems and republicans started screaming "socialism" cuz that was worse than letting people freeze to death.
6275 2018-12-20 14:45:15 What's funny is that people are voting that think who they're voting for is going to pay their rent or their mortgage. And the disgusting elements in your esteemed Party encourage those lies. So, really, who is the POS here? Are you also in the snake oil business?
6276 2018-12-20 14:45:10 Nice fund for that next oil painting of Donald it signed Jerry Jones Football.
6277 2018-12-20 14:45:10 By that logic why are we still in Iraq? Could it be the oil? Money, Money, Money.  It makes the Trump go round. #NotMyPresident

6279 2018-12-20 14:45:07 Donny you know the deal. Oil is traded in USD, and the US repays the favour by offering young American lifes to protect the Arabs. It's quite simple.
Happy Holidays Honey.
6280 2018-12-20 14:45:07 @this_vid
6281 2018-12-20 14:45:05 Yes. But all except your big boss, Israel, recognize your need for their oil. And the crooks who run the show in your country are slaves to them. So they will keep kicking those dirty arses... despite incidents like 9/11.
6282 2018-12-20 14:44:57 Come on lol. If you’ve bought snake oil once, you’ll buy it again...and again...
6283 2018-12-20 14:44:55 That Portia M marula oil absorbs nicely onto my skin . I love it !!!
6284 2018-12-20 14:44:31 That's a copout comeback. Being concerned for the environment doesn't mean one is anti-oil. I understand the need for resource extraction ... just not at ANY cost. Maybe the oil execs could make half of what they do, and also protect the environment?
6285 2018-12-20 14:44:29 Changing out the break pads, rotating tires and changing oil. Heck - lesson is, don't skimp out on that stuff. Like ever.
6286 2018-12-20 14:44:27 No way did all those donations from oil and gas execs have anything to do with this
6287 2018-12-20 14:44:21 @EmParker thank you both! I use CBD oil orally, but unfortunately it hasn't done much for my pain relief. I've been thinking about using CBD skin creams/CBD gummies so perhaps I'll give them a try!
6288 2018-12-20 14:44:21 RT CNNBusiness: The Dow opened down 150 points Thursday after sinking sharply a day earlier. Crude oil was down more than 3% as bearish sentiment continues for the economy and demand. Altria fell 2% after buying a 35% stake in e-cigarette maker Juul. Watch live …
6289 2018-12-20 14:44:20 Russia, Iran and Syria (you mean Assad) are glad we are leaving. Assad survives, Iran expands operations against Israel, and Putin sews regional and European discord. Putin controls more oil and American influence shrinks. Well done, puppet.
6290 2018-12-20 14:44:14 たーのしかったで。はしゃいでしまった
6291 2018-12-20 14:44:12 Sweet, so Alberta can then turn down the 1.6 billion promised from the feds and pay back the billions accrued in EI and disaster aid since oil took a dump during the conservative regime. Oh and build a teleport machine to transport resources through the rest of Canada lolz.
6292 2018-12-20 14:44:09 In the 80s oil still carried 65% of foreign revenue.  I'm here to discuss fact and not emotion. Counter it fact and figures not just sentiments.
6293 2018-12-20 14:43:58 You good? You seem to have headaches frequently. You should get some peppermint oil for some relief.
6294 2018-12-20 14:43:53 The oil 
6295 2018-12-20 14:43:48 Young man, the country faced recession because of oil price crash. We are not better than Brazil that faced same economic woes. Go and read about recession and how it affects the employment figures.

6298 2018-12-20 14:43:31 November-December 2013 oil was still way over $100/barrel and there were already shortages of toilet paper and medicine.
6299 2018-12-20 14:43:27 Do you trust ISIS? It is what it has always been in Middle East. Don't you think we have spent enough lives & $ ? They want to continue the decades,centuries of destruction? I think we did our part. It's all about Golan, oil, &,their God? Afghanistan 17 flipping years?
6300 2018-12-20 14:43:26 i heard about this last night. I guess the gingerbread man got pissed at us assuming it's gender.. smh
6301 2018-12-20 14:43:24 Now that we don't need their oil, who cares about the mideast?

6306 2018-12-20 14:42:39 Yes we must protect the oil supply,has nothing to do with Christians
6307 2018-12-20 14:42:25 Led astray by a snake oil salesman from Queens
6308 2018-12-20 14:42:24 He’s a snake oil salesman and always has Ben. You’ve been had. Welcome to the light.
6309 2018-12-20 14:42:21 I don't think oiling the wood handle with olive oil is good, since it can go rancid and all. Definitely not something you want on your wooden knife handle.

Mineral oil? Pharmacy should have it yeah? It's not edible tho, peanut oil? lol

6312 2018-12-20 14:41:59 Top ten oil industry memes 

1.  "You use oil/hypocrite"

This one is used by far the most to shame an individual or group to stop criticism of the industry.  We're supposed to worry about what car we drive or how we heat our home rather than, say the expansion of the tar sands.
6313 2018-12-20 14:41:59 It isn’t so simple. The oil needs to be refined and the refineries can only handle certain types of crude.
6314 2018-12-20 14:41:52 @CityofEdmonton it’s obvious the council is not in touch with the people. Increase in property tax when the economy is slow people out of work oil price at a all time low. Shows how the city has complete disregard for the people. Time for a change
6315 2018-12-20 14:41:44 also if u need more citrussy smells (in summer to keep flies away from kitchen) add a few drops lemongrass or grapefruit oil! :)
6316 2018-12-20 14:41:44 It’s amazing what Trump has done with Dems, the media, the DOJ, CIA, FBI, the Fed and half the GOP in DC against him. Hot economy, jobs, deregulation, trade deals, tax reform, gas prices and reduced reliance on foreign oil, black unemployment, prison reform. Time for a wall!!!
6317 2018-12-20 14:41:38 I need a oil change, my car vacuumed and a full tank of gas.
6318 2018-12-20 14:41:28 He’s an academic snake oil salesman, a charlatan, and a coward.
6319 2018-12-20 14:41:24 my tattoo was mad as shit last night smh i gotta get more coconut oil
6320 2018-12-20 14:41:15 Time to get prepared to hear “Quay you in college come help me change my oil, fix my phone, and take out my appendix”
6321 2018-12-20 14:41:06 Most of what #Trump has done I've supported. But the pulling our troops out of Syria in my option is a very big mistake. I see Iran, Turkey, and Russia taken advantage of the land. To gain power over oil, and to take arms against Israel. #DontPullOurTroops.
6322 2018-12-20 14:41:06 Before you curve me in the DM, just remember my genotype is AA 
6323 2018-12-20 14:41:03 oil well
6324 2018-12-20 14:40:59 In case anybody was wondering exactly how unusual my company is, my manager got tired of me not eating or sleeping and she just dosed me with CBD oil.
6325 2018-12-20 14:40:56 They put a whole bottle of olive oil in it though! 
6326 2018-12-20 14:40:47 Isn’t “ethical oil” an oxymoron?
6327 2018-12-20 14:40:47 เขาคือคนที่แจกเยอะๆเเบบจ้อจี้งับ เขาแจกเเล้วไม่ตอบ แจกแล้วไม่โอน
6328 2018-12-20 14:40:47 Can someone remind Shelagh Fogarty that Assad is still the legitimate leader of that country in case the oil stealing West has forgotten...@LBC
6329 2018-12-20 14:40:46 Maybe if you all changed your own oil, you’d know.

6332 2018-12-20 14:40:27 If Quebec really wanted Alberta oil it would happen overnight. The French are LIARS!
6333 2018-12-20 14:40:21 I want to see Sarnia's workforce THRIVE. Workers will always be needed regardless of how we get our energy. Don't make this about hating oil workers. It's about health for the economy and the planet. trades and engineers will always be an essential part of this.
6334 2018-12-20 14:40:20 So price fixing is ok, as long as the culprits are from Quebec? What if Alberta oil producers colluded to fix ix the price of oil, would that be ok?
6335 2018-12-20 14:40:20 Oh yeah, that car gonna need several oil changes once we done (EW)
6336 2018-12-20 14:40:13 Fox News is on in the lobby of my oil change place and I want to nail my eyelids to the floor.
6337 2018-12-20 14:40:10 We certainly can get it from other markets   and East coast oil is ramping up in the next few years so there's that to look forward to as well.
6338 2018-12-20 14:40:10 It’s amazing what Trump has done with Dems, the media, the DOJ, CIA, FBI, the Fed and half the GOP in DC against him. Hot economy, jobs, deregulation, trade deals, tax reform, gas prices and reduced reliance on foreign oil, black unemployment, prison reform. Time for a wall!!!
6339 2018-12-20 14:40:09 ああ、これ？スポーツブラ。油の貯蔵庫が垂れちゃうからね。
6340 2018-12-20 14:40:06 Russian population has been steadily declining, economy is short on innovation, oil price is low and probably will stay that way, education system is bad in comparison with the West, infrastructure is crumbling, investments are falling - but sure, time is on Russia side 
6341 2018-12-20 14:39:49 Have you seen the pictures of the oil pits they have in that region. Very ecologically disturbing. No refineries around they boil the crude to make fuel.
6342 2018-12-20 14:39:43 Have you heard of that black seed oil? I’m going to have to give it a shot.
6343 2018-12-20 14:39:42 Tergantung nderr, mo make buat yg ngebersihin make up waterproof atau nggak. Yg oil(kuning) wangi banget bau nya, buat ngebersihin make up waterproof mantul bgt, biasanya aku ngebersihin maskara kudu pake eye removernya maybelline tp pake garnier kuning bisa bangett

6348 2018-12-20 14:39:21 I thought you were an ally of Israel? Israel does not appreciate our help?  Kept America safe, and oil flowing to us and the rest of the world.
6349 2018-12-20 14:39:20 Hmmmmm... Oil paint bisa (secara pengalaman ngeblend warna aku seneng tp larang dan mambu wkwkwk), acrylic paint bisa (nah ini ada yg murah dan ga bau), pakai gouache juga oke (belum nyoba, kayaknya mirip cet air tp ndak terlalu bikin emosi).

Atau pake make up pallete aja 
6350 2018-12-20 14:39:19 They are also protesting for a different form of oil transporting. Shouldn't truckers be protesting for more oil tankers not less?
6351 2018-12-20 14:39:13 I honestly think a lot of these people assume Alberta oil is the same as Middle East oil.
They don't comprehend the difference between "heavy" and "light" oil and the cost/time to refine each type.
As long as light oil is available, Alberta will always be behind the game.
6352 2018-12-20 14:39:12 Oil as an energy source will come off line gradually, but we can cut all ties with Saudis over night.
6353 2018-12-20 14:39:11 It pains me to write this, b/c I think so highly of you. But I strongly disagree.
US pulls out then Turkey can subjugate the Kurds again, 20,000 ISIS fighters can reform and strengthen, Putin gets the middle east and access to oil.
Did we learn nothing from pulling out of Iraq?
6354 2018-12-20 14:39:09 Got my oil changed yesterday and apparently your heater actually works after that. Also it’s not supposed to be black. This is why I have a dad, so I can avoid these responsibilities 
6355 2018-12-20 14:39:07 Only way for the coming oil glut to be avoid imo is if all major oil producers meet and agree to set production targets, just isn't going to happen

6360 2018-12-20 14:38:35 That seems low - talking from an oil natgas guy - is it?
6361 2018-12-20 14:38:31 We use olive oil! Same effect, no harsh chemicals on your eardrum!
6362 2018-12-20 14:38:24 Looking for essential oil candles...I would make them but meh.
6363 2018-12-20 14:37:51 A dichotomy of stupid. "We aren't making any money" "bringing back coal jobs" "I do not believe in climate change" but refuses to support alternative fuel and energy and wonders why we are in the middle east because of our dependency on oil.
6364 2018-12-20 14:37:48 Oil glut is going to happen due to disruption of energy and transport industries, not massive sources
As prices fall companies will try to maintain profits by increased sells

6366 2018-12-20 14:37:46 This is so nt true unless u went to get free stuffs from dem. 
Only half malt is any 1k.
Refill pack of cowbell won't be less than 600, 
let's say dat yam is as cheap as 700
Kerosin alone, can't even say, 
1bottle of red and g.nut oil abt 800 forget d rest am over 2500# already
6367 2018-12-20 14:37:44 Well Oil was always on comfortable range for full Modi term except last 3 Months.Even after they taxed the fuel heavily and collected huge amount they failed to channelise the same in a right Manner where GDP could be pushed above 8%.Disaster!
6368 2018-12-20 14:37:39 Oil will be king queen and knight for a long long time.
6369 2018-12-20 14:37:38 @free_thinker @pbhushan1 @khanumarfa @office0ffRG_
Nation knows the truth but ModiMouthpieceMalvia wants a snake oil salesman, who offers gift wrapped packages with nothing inside, to be the pm again. Obviously, for the mouthpiece, his master comes first. Nation comes after.
6370 2018-12-20 14:37:36 I can’t give you guarantees, but as a very aged investor since the 70’s I’ve seen this scene before. The DJIA is mankind made mankind controlled. Watch the greats and ask yourself, “What are the “Big Dogs” doing?” Positioning. Y2K remember? Oil Embargoes remember? Bank failure?
6371 2018-12-20 14:37:28 Its horrible. fracking damage to the environment is the largest oil subsidy because taxpayers pay for environmental damage and Big Oil does not.
6372 2018-12-20 14:37:23 So arguing against green tech subsidies based on current % GDP and using that to justify the myriad of direct and indirect subsidies the oil patch gets is simply nonsensical. /2 ~fin~
6373 2018-12-20 14:37:17 And protecting Big Oil against any worthwhile action on climate change.
6374 2018-12-20 14:37:15 Yes. BC gets 90% of its oil from Alberta. Eastern provinces less than that but still more than 50%.
6375 2018-12-20 14:37:13 Whatever one's political orientation, can any1 honestly say US involvement in Middle East politics in last 40 yrs has done much of anything but make it worse? Withdrawal will cause disruption but far less than US already has caused. Break our oil addiction. Problem solved.
6376 2018-12-20 14:37:13 The scent of this newly gotten Moroccan Argan oil has me feeling like a bouquet.
6377 2018-12-20 14:37:11 The Braying comes from being in the Bar since Breakfast time. HoC should be an alcohol free zone.

6378 2018-12-20 14:37:05 I am a robot. I piss oil
6379 2018-12-20 14:36:52 Huge thank you for @extractlabs for sending me out my CBD oil, just in time for Christmas! Huge thank you to @criscyborg also
6380 2018-12-20 14:36:36 @NDP hiding from the oil protesters scared to show support as the carbon tax proves that the NDP is equally against the pipeline. Talk is cheep actions are what shows concern. End the carbon tax show support
6381 2018-12-20 14:36:35 Finally you r greeting petrol price cheaper than 5 years back but you want it more cheaper as proportional to crude oil. At the same time due you accept the petrol price proportional to crude oil when crude price increased to more than 100 $
6382 2018-12-20 14:36:33 PH 
Where you see Alot number of lazy youths quoted by #buhari,  hustling is a sin to them,  shortcut life made easy,  strangers in charge of all the companies in the state, while they steal and tout around, (crude oil spoil the state)
6383 2018-12-20 14:36:30 Didn't find any oil?
6384 2018-12-20 14:36:26 You're trying to draw an irrelevant equivalency here.  The government invested heavily in the development of the oil sands and related tech at a time when it _wasn't_ a large part of the GDP; /1
6385 2018-12-20 14:36:18 A couple of my suggestions at the TradersExpo in November were to be long Gold and short Crude Oil. Basis the futures markets with one position each, Gold is up over $50 and Crude is down over $10.
6386 2018-12-20 14:36:12 Do you know anything at all about the USA? They buy things, they don’t take things. That’s how they built the largest economy in history. Alberta would be free to build their industries and sell oil at higher prices in US$!

6388 2018-12-20 14:36:08 Have you read bill C69? It will gut our energy sector! Downstream emissions for our oil but not the millions of barrels of foreign oil that eastern Canada purchases from other nations like Saudi Arabia? Then there is the gender balanced energy crap?
Justin is a nightmare !
6389 2018-12-20 14:36:07 Haha professional jobs.. good one. You're clueless. Last I check the oil rigs aren't professional.
6390 2018-12-20 14:36:04 I want my next relationship to last longer than my next oil change .
6391 2018-12-20 14:36:03 Next stop for trucks should be ports out east protesting foreign oil being transported through our coastline.  Canada has its own supply that would not require coastal transport.
6392 2018-12-20 14:36:01 好みとかもあるからね
6393 2018-12-20 14:35:57 Never have understood U.S. strategy which leaves all other NATO countries sitting at home.  We must get big % of the oil.
6394 2018-12-20 14:35:53 oil fields deplete. 

Depletion causes reduced cash flow. Depletion never stops but cost cutting does. end of story.

i would never count on OPEC.
6395 2018-12-20 14:35:52 Add ending subsidies for oil companies to the list.
6396 2018-12-20 14:35:51 I have noticed that there have always been business interests in the USA that love th US to be in the Middle East. Related to oil, for instance. And israel...
6397 2018-12-20 14:35:46 Putin leads a country with a declining population and an economy smaller than Italy's.  The drop in oil prices must be hurting them a lot.  Have you ever bought anything that was made in Russia?
6398 2018-12-20 14:35:42 Um, that’s EXACTLY what’s going to happen.  Watching these fools buy snake oil from is absolutely A-MA-ZING. Thanks, Trump. You’re good for something.

6401 2018-12-20 14:35:18 「自分が何か悪いことをしたのか」と延々考える癖、やめたい。
私を嫌うのは相手の問題だ。私は関係ない。こうやって露骨に攻撃してくる人とは極力関わらないようにしていこう。それが職場のボスザルであっても媚びうる必要なんかない。いつものようにボーッと自分の仕事すればいいだけ。…おやすみ。
6402 2018-12-20 14:35:16 /rlt/ oat sm olive oil bisa dijadiin satu buat masker ga?

6404 2018-12-20 14:35:05 More short sighted do it now BS from the CPCHQ thsi is why they fail they never think of the future they just blow it all out the door when it happens to get a few more patsy's to vote for him if my leader lied to my face, IE Saudi oil 4 ,times He wouldn't be my leader #abpoli

6406 2018-12-20 14:34:50 I wonder what she thinks that layer of oil on the top of the almond butter is? Is "oil-free" vegan even a thing?
6407 2018-12-20 14:34:46 Wow!  That's huge savings - on both ends!  I go from $0.10 per mile (for gas only, not oil, repairs, maintenance too) to $0.03 per mile, but in Canada it seems it would be more like $0.18 or so to around $0.02 - 9x reduction versus 3x!!  Wow!  Just ... WOW!!
6408 2018-12-20 14:34:39 in australia i used it for cleaning: just mix with white vinegar, put in some teatree oil. was very potent! definitely a better way than buying 10 different products for cleaning i think!
6409 2018-12-20 14:34:35 Solid talaga drive-in ng motor pag bagong change oil.
6410 2018-12-20 14:34:33 Thanks bro
6411 2018-12-20 14:34:27 I don't know what's happened to Alberta. Maybe there's something to this oil field pollution affecting brains, after all. Sad!!!
6412 2018-12-20 14:34:21 Beli sarang burung untuk bapak sebab bapak batuk lama tak baik2, lepas tu beli pulak argan oil, lepas tu tengok baki tabung shopee tinggal rm1. Lepas tu verangan nak beli backpack pulak. Adoi la hai.
6413 2018-12-20 14:34:19 are you ecstatic over minimum wages?

He victimizes everyone and everything.
Continuously blames Harper for his own failures
Likes dictatorships.

Supports ISIS.
Believes he's above the Law, and act's the part.
Hates the Oil industry.
on and on
6417 2018-12-20 14:34:11 I think the oil story has been a dearth of demand since October. There are some markets out there predicting a nuclear winter of a recession.
6418 2018-12-20 14:33:56 Why? They need the oil.
6419 2018-12-20 14:33:54 We have sanctions on Venezuela president... No such sanctions on the non oil countries with abnormally high murder rates...
6420 2018-12-20 14:33:52 Yes, because the federal government has spent a shitload of money by buying a pipeline to stop Alberta from exporting  its oil
6421 2018-12-20 14:33:52 I’m so happy that my oil changes are free
6422 2018-12-20 14:33:48 A Labourite butt kiss writes to an oil painting 
6423 2018-12-20 14:33:23 Understated importance~> Only Kuwait will be able to make ends meet at $55 oil price.
6424 2018-12-20 14:33:11 What is point of quoting the statement of Patel ji here ??? You want cheaper oil, is this only issue for you !! So when crude oil price will suddenly increase to 100 rs then r u ready to pay the petrol price proportionally ?? R u ready to pay the sudden hike in agri products !!
6425 2018-12-20 14:33:04 oil fields deplete.

6427 2018-12-20 14:32:50 Yesterday a customer asked me “what’s the difference between fish oil and vitamin E?” And I legit said “well...uh..one is fish oil and one is vitamin E”. This is why I get the big bucks.
6428 2018-12-20 14:32:49 I got a flat tire and when I took it in to get fixed, I got an oil change and my brake fluid flushed too.

6432 2018-12-20 14:32:18 Ethical!!? It's being drilled by a corporation, tell me what ethics a corporation has? Ethics is something a human has, or has not. Oil Sands require up to 4 barrels of water for every barrel of oil, 23 Billion cubic feet of water are used per year to extract this stuff. Oil
6433 2018-12-20 14:32:07 There are lot of adjustment to d budget...starting from the benchmark of crude oil to Barrel/day.. Crude is lingering around $56...

6436 2018-12-20 14:32:05 Buffalo has Niagara Falls, the Great Niagara River Gorge, and just as much nature, and a better hockey team. You forgot the oily, slimy air, up there and the loss of oil revenue in 25 years will turn your city into a ghost town before another Stanley Cup is won there.

6442 2018-12-20 14:31:35 His long game is hitting oil one day.
6443 2018-12-20 14:31:27 not oil? i've been told it's oil.
6444 2018-12-20 14:31:26 Trump destroyed the Terrorists funding source oil. USA is now the number 1 producer of Oil so it’s not the same story different day it’s new. Trump destroyed financial infrastructure of ISIS and terror organizations. Why cant everyone see this?
6445 2018-12-20 14:31:21 Well I hope you're not going to vote for the @CPC_HQ ! Look what they did to Alberta and the oil sands: NOTHING and the oil was selling for $100/barrel. If you lean right vote @peoplespca. If you lean left vote: @NDP

6455 2018-12-20 14:30:43 Drove up to Audi for my car servicing. They slapped with with a £500 charge for service and oil change. 

Me: nahh man you guys are trying to bumped me, i dont need a oil change just service and a bottle of windscreen washer . Fuck this Ill just got halfords
6456 2018-12-20 14:30:42 pollsters really are snake oil salesmen..
6457 2018-12-20 14:30:39 just saying it doesn't make it happen, oil will be the primary for decades as there is no current resource or technology that can replace oil to meet the demand
6458 2018-12-20 14:30:34 Η Motor Oil διαπραγματεύεται στα 20,65 ευρώ με απώλειες 3,73% όγκο 62 χιλ. τεμάχια και αποτίμηση 2,28 δισ. ευρώ
6459 2018-12-20 14:30:33 Lol that's far from the point dear. Oil price went down,  even the govt couldn't pay salaries which reduces the purchasing power of the workers thereby stiffling the economy.

6476 2018-12-20 14:29:12 Thats a great article that has absolutely nothing to do with pipelines. 
If your position is that the oil sands are a toxic mess that will cost a fortune to clean up, ok but that is not the topic being discussed

6480 2018-12-20 14:28:54 They might be concerned that once Russia get their hands on the oil? The world becomes a more expensive place? To be clear.
6481 2018-12-20 14:28:50 The biggest factor in bringing transparency to the Syrian issue was Russia identifying and blowing up the convoys, which were supported by CIA, to give oil to Turkey in exchange for more weapons to use against Assad. US hasn't done much but get in the way. Russia pushes Iran out.
6482 2018-12-20 14:28:45 I'm about there too.......just gonna buy some more oil stocks before they go lower again!
6483 2018-12-20 14:28:37 their coffers have dried up because they lost the oil fields. but they made billions before that happened. you can defeat them militarily, but the ideology is much harder to kill

6507 2018-12-20 14:26:51 It has, not that US taxpayers should have been financially responsible for any of this. If Big Oil wants a pipeline Assad won’t let them build, let them spend their own money trying to solve that problem.

6535 2018-12-20 14:24:20 For a number of years, Quebec was an ally of Alberta.  Not sure this approach is the best way to win over Quebec.

6540 2018-12-20 14:23:44 I recall a race to take the oil fields of Africa during WWII. No gas, no tanks. It weakened Hitler. Dangerous to let Putin remain, unless we somehow arm the rebels and they’re able to fight like a Taliban or ISIS.

6552 2018-12-20 14:22:59 Your decreased fuel consumption is kind of the goal for this government. They look at that as a sign that their unofficial agenda to "phase out the oil sands" and force the development of "not an alternative route but an alternative economy" is working even faster than expected.

6579 2018-12-20 14:20:45 1. Refinery, in the singular. Currently only Irving Oil operates a refinery in the Maritimes. (Not including NFLD.)

2. Said same oil company announced their intentions to build an upgrader to process bitumen when Energy East was still a thing.

3. AB already sells at a discount.

6581 2018-12-20 14:20:37 The US oil production is mostly (85%) unprofitable fracking based
It puts pressure on OPEC and oil prices
OPEC production mostly conventional profitable production

Its like a game of chicken. Who will lose?

OPEC production profitable
US production unprofitable

Its very clear

It causes buildup which will block your hair from getting the moisture it needs over time. It's also an oil, and oils repel water, meaning-
6585 2018-12-20 14:20:22 1. About Natural gas we speak earlier and I like your article. But about oil I doubt about fundamentals factors. One year not enough for me to make strong conclusion.  In the longterm (1 year plus) it will work but <1 year I am not so sure. For example OPEC look on OECD stocks.

6588 2018-12-20 14:19:57 Iraq war under 43 was about revenge & oil. We should of never went to war. Afghanistan has become an endless war and both of these wars cost us trillions of dollars & still counting. Solutions anyone???
6589 2018-12-20 14:19:56 We see in other brands like #misura or @Barilla they are NOT using #palmoil at all.

6592 2018-12-20 14:19:47 It’s about time a President has the guts to do this for our troops. We have been on the Middle East for too long. If we do need to go back we need to take everything they have gold, jewels and oil. Leave no prisoners.

6612 2018-12-20 14:18:09 They sold it out for a % of that $500 billion worth of oil Rosneft has in Russia, hence the reason they brought Tillerson in early. Trump also owes Blackstone-bayrock anywhere from $100-600 million (need to see tax returns to know). That's why they're doing it. Huge $$

6627 2018-12-20 14:16:32 A carbon tax alone will not put the oil companies out of business. Many nations have both a carbon tax and cap and trade. By themselves they are not enough. But they do push the transition to renewables. A mass transition to renewables will put the oil companies out of business.

6640 2018-12-20 14:15:41 As a side note to this, Vancouver is the centre of Canada's mining industry. Those companies do awful things here and especially abroad (see South America). Vancouverites don't complain about mining like we do about oil. Why? Because mining feeds our families. It's that simple.

It's easy then to understand how all other parts will move.

They want to drill in Golan Heights in Syria. Moving the Embassy to Jerusalem is all about taking the oil.
6679 2018-12-20 14:11:36 Look let’s be clear the US defeated ISIs through strategic increase in Oil production. Trump knew he must take away the funding source of terrorism. It’s gone USA number 1 producer of oil in the world! Pay attention
6680 2018-12-20 14:11:26 The current oil price is $67 par barrel. So if we intend to sell it at the minimum price of 12 US cents per barrel, that's 0.2% of the current market price... We would rather have it stay in the ground than sell it at that price. 

But in whose interest do these ministers work??
6681 2018-12-20 14:11:22 So you’re going to force the CIA, oil company stooges, mercenary forces and state department dickheads who are constantly stirring up the shit to leave, right? No? Didn’t think so.

6722 2018-12-20 14:07:58 You’re the queen of hyperbole. The idea she hasn’t tried to build this is ridiculous. She can’t control price of oil, federal policy or the courts.

6725 2018-12-20 14:07:47 Obviously, no way a couple mad professors at one university have the power to do this, are you saying big oil is really making this happen world wide ? and why ?

6727 2018-12-20 14:07:41 I got the piint he was making, and while not entirely wrong, the points he made are long since fixed technologies.

As for the rest of the oil products, that's about 4% of total oil extracted/processed and (except for asphalt) bitumen isn't well suited for much of it.
6728 2018-12-20 14:07:39 "Guess my age" is such bullshit arrogant passive-aggressive narcissism. This message brought to you by Oil of Olay.
6729 2018-12-20 14:07:32 Good point. The area is far less strategic to us now that we are long oil
6730 2018-12-20 14:07:30 We do it for the oil and for Israel.  So yes, we will always have a presence in the Middle East or we can watch gas prices soar.
6731 2018-12-20 14:07:30 Raise your hand if the guy changing the oil in your car this morning found A LOT of dog food in your air filter. 
6732 2018-12-20 14:07:27 I deadass burnt the shit out of my face with some tea tree oil and it hurts so bad 
6733 2018-12-20 14:07:20 A hopeful though is that it feels like Jan. 2016 right now. Here's a MarketWatch lead from that selloff:
U.S. stocks closed sharply lower Friday, locking in the worst 10-day start to a calendar year ever, as oil prices plunged and investors worried about slowing growth in the US

6736 2018-12-20 14:07:14 I have read the whole thing, and I know what I think about it. I’m just wondering, why do you think the foolish virgins showed up to wait with not enough oil to last until He arrived (but the wise virgins brought enough)?
6737 2018-12-20 14:07:10 Pulled up to the dealer exactly at 8 and i still got wait an hour for my car oil change.

6740 2018-12-20 14:07:01 Reports are that SDF & Damascus are in negotiations about Omar Oil Fields.
6741 2018-12-20 14:07:01 Olodo! It doesn't work like that. You are too much of a simpleton. It's the excess profit over the oil benchmark and it's a recurrent revenue thing, not anything special as to tie it to any 16 years. Learn son!
6742 2018-12-20 14:07:00 Like killing 200 Russians in Syria? Like destroying the Russian economy with oil production?   You're clueless.
6743 2018-12-20 14:06:59 Maybe “they” shouldn’t have had 17 candidates. But Trump is more of a symptom of a malaise that spreads beyond the US. The world is changing. Snake oil salesmen promising to stop it (even when nothing adds up) go far.
6744 2018-12-20 14:06:59 How much oil are you adding everytime?

I need to take my own peng pictures before the year runs out 
6747 2018-12-20 14:06:35 If they would just get off our oil it would save everybody a lot fo trouble.
6748 2018-12-20 14:06:22 ต้นทุนการผลิต shale gas และ shale oil ของอเมริกาเมื่อก่อนอยู่ที่ 50 เหรียญต่อบาร์เรล ซึ่งตอนนี้ราคาน้ำมันอยู่ที่ 46 เหรียญซึ่งต่ำกว่าต้นทุนการผลิต ถ้าอเมริกายังผลิตเพิ่มขึ้นเรื่อยๆ แสดงว่าเทคโนโลยีการผลิตก้าวหน้าขึ้นทำให้ต้นทุนต่ำลง เราอาจเห็นน้ำมันกลับมาที่ 40 เหรียญก็ได้
6749 2018-12-20 14:06:07 Unfortunately, Trump doesn't care what anybody thinks, least of all us.
The bigger picture is that the Middle East is becoming less important, as oil becomes less important for the USA. Therefore less reason to be involved.
And the US no longer has to be the world's policeman.
6750 2018-12-20 14:06:06 pero anong shade ng blush sa nichido kaya magandang bilhin? cool rum or fresh tomato? or yung oil control blush nalang ng careline? tomato? UUuuuuu
6751 2018-12-20 14:06:02 yes palm oil boycott is the only way. People barely know what palm oil production is linked to, so chosing between (poorly) certified or not certified palm oil (any any related products) will only confuse them.
6752 2018-12-20 14:05:55 Don't give me the bullshit line about "government subsidies being bad in other sectors, but not oil".  You don't get to have it both ways.
6753 2018-12-20 14:05:53 What oil do they use to fry the chicken. I don’t believe you eat this chicken Alex.

6757 2018-12-20 14:05:41 Oh I'm aware. But the point being that there needs to be more understanding on both sides. Calgarians aren't listening to the pollution argument because oil companies literally feed their kids. People tend to put food and shelter before environment. And on the BC side...
6758 2018-12-20 14:05:32 Crude oil at $55 and Sai Baba presents a budget of N8t. How do you plan to fund it, Jubril El Sudan?
6759 2018-12-20 14:05:27 Most of y’all have a dehydrated skin,it’s not everything moisturizers can cure,it only works for dry skin,
Dehydrated skin lacks water while dry skin lacks moisture(oil) so simple things like drinking enough water can go a very long way on your skin.

6764 2018-12-20 14:05:07 Raising rates are good for oil long term. They will deprive marginally profitable US drillers of capital and help to force decline in production at this price levels.
6765 2018-12-20 14:05:05 What a soft heading for a amazing hardship story at Christmas time!!
600 million in bribe $$$$$$$$ working for Justin + libs!! 
Liberals phased out CB coal and they will do it to Alberta oil!!
6766 2018-12-20 14:04:57 What’s your opinion about offshore oil market? If I’m not wrong, backlog decreasing after the recent sell-off.

6772 2018-12-20 14:04:30 The United States is now an oil exporter... withdrawing from the Persian Gulf. There is little pressure on the United States. The pressure on other countries is enormous.
6773 2018-12-20 14:04:23 I used Dr. Miracle’s deep conditioner that comes in the packet for like $1. That shit treated my hair!! People out here asking me if I relaxed it  

** I also use Cantu and olive oil and creme of nature.. this one just hits different 
6774 2018-12-20 14:04:18 Disagree. Trumps right on this one. We are now and will be for years an oil exporter no reason to be in the middle east any more. What really is Iran and Russia inheriting? Just another backwards Muslim country that's going nowhere and never will
6775 2018-12-20 14:04:18 I thought cow farts were “rampidly” affecting climate change. Time to kill dairy farms just like the oil and gas industry.
6776 2018-12-20 14:04:17 First of all I’m with them I get I was part of Oil and Gas for 44 years. The protest route I saw on TV originally traveled in and around Nisku/Leduc area correct? Agitating commuters on the Henday Edmonton’s most busy route during rush hour is not how you get a positive message.
6777 2018-12-20 14:04:15 Does anyone want to give me a massage with oil?
6778 2018-12-20 14:04:07 But u said that ISIS was defeated.  How can ISIS still be fighting if it was defeated. . On another note, the Middle East has always been a region in which USA has been involved because 1) Oil; 2) Israel. Learn some history.  
6779 2018-12-20 14:03:58 Given them all the oil and gas drilling rights in Alaska.
6780 2018-12-20 14:03:57 What is up with the one track mind always about oil. Let's invest in clean alternatives that's what people want.
6781 2018-12-20 14:03:52 Depends if it has a wound on its ears or not but try tea tree oil...works in the outback as a repellent...should work in the Miz too 
6782 2018-12-20 14:03:52 That sounds delicious. I've been roasting my sprouts in olive oil, salt and pepper this year. I think they're delicious that way and even him indoors will eat them that way!

6787 2018-12-20 14:03:36 The curse of economies that depend on oil or other key commodities. The gulf states became wiser, they know what's coming and diversified their economies. Sudan is in for even worse times ahead. Angola, Nigeria, are you listening?
6788 2018-12-20 14:03:34 HAHAHAHAHAHA who knew that Trump could make the left support ongoing Middle Eastern meddling, oil interests and millions of dollars in Defense spending

6790 2018-12-20 14:03:22 Here’s a thought. Why don’t they create a convoy all down the Trans-Canada Highway to Montreal...and while they’re at they could string a firehose or even a garden hose from truck to truck...and then they could pipe some oil through the hose to market.

6793 2018-12-20 14:02:51 With global oil pricing falling and forecasted to even drop more next year. We’re depleting our ECA funds... Coincidentally this is happening in an elections year. We watch.
6794 2018-12-20 14:02:42 My shit so bad I started using motor oil
6795 2018-12-20 14:02:40 That will lead to nothing as we have seen and witnessed a lot of incidents that linked between ISIS and Erdogan + his son on the basis of selling oil and so, however it's good to  hear from a different view and let's cheer for peace not war!!

6797 2018-12-20 14:02:34 How about focusing on the fact that the Fed is potentially committing the error of raising rates & signalling further hikes despite a 35% drop in oil. NEVER (again..never) has the Fed tightened in an envmt of falling oil. This is espclly a problem when US has become net exporter
6798 2018-12-20 14:02:27 Tamanu oil kat mana kau sebat? Tapi kulit kau jenis normal kan? Aku combination oily. Tak ada lagi moisturizer aku pakai yang tak buat hidung aku berminyak esoknya kecuali kalau mix dengan centella ampoule skin1004 tu

6800 2018-12-20 14:02:16 Whats the long term plan? I see Alberta as having two critical industries (beef and oil), both dying industries in the long term and susceptible to wide factors that could render them obsolete. Cross tourism off the list. What is the long term plan?
6801 2018-12-20 14:02:15 Ok PQ - make it happen and demand Canadian oil only!

6812 2018-12-20 14:01:23 The oil money is gone now, US is the number 1 exporter of oil that is what defeated ISIS. Trump went after the money supporting terror. Oil

6846 2018-12-20 13:58:39 Outstanding! Just make sure that you’re getting it from a reliable source. We have patients using CBD oil, and still testing positive for THC. We need more regulation!!!
6847 2018-12-20 13:58:39 thus leaving Russia all the gas and oil - this is economic suicide on the part of @realDonaldTrump  - Syria is a gateway to the neighbouring countries reserves and passage of pipelines.... is he deliberately sabotaging the US economy in preparation for being removed from office?

I 2 support oil and gas, but I’m not sure this was the best way:(
6850 2018-12-20 13:58:17 I’m a Labour member. And hate the Tories as much as you. I understand your arguments, but Scotland would be better off under a Corbyn government. I am interested in learning more. Isn’t the economic case for independence mainly oil based? That’s fragile. No?!

6852 2018-12-20 13:58:07 They’re also the biggest oil producers and want to lock us into #fossilfuels indefinitely. Dinosaurs wrecking the lives of future generations.
6853 2018-12-20 13:58:05 Because POTUS and his crooked EPA administration are in bed with Big Oil. 

Has the ethanol/corn industry had any luck with their lawsuit to force the EPA to redistribute exempted gallons?
6854 2018-12-20 13:57:59 Gotta use "The Body Shop Cedar & Sage Conditioning Beard Oil "
6855 2018-12-20 13:57:58 Don’t forget promoting oil as the cleanest form of energy.

6857 2018-12-20 13:57:55 Thanks Laura.
We enjoyed your show.

I retired at 58 after 40 years in the oil and gas industry (but do short term consulting after hunting / best offshore fishing seasons). Enjoy life!
6858 2018-12-20 13:57:53 My gas light + oil change light are both on in my car. If that’s not a reflection of how I’m mentally feeling I don’t know what is
6859 2018-12-20 13:57:41 Problem here is that they are all burning fuel which will just put more money into the coffers of the people your protesting. Want to make a statement, turn off all the engines. Show what will happen if the oil doesn't flow.

6861 2018-12-20 13:57:33 Trudeau does not import oil. The only Saudi oil that is imported to Canada is by Irving Oil in NB. Your beef is with them.
6862 2018-12-20 13:57:28 My hair does that right in the middle , hair stylist tell me that .they say they’ve never seen such a thing . I put pumpkin oil & peppermint oil in different masks together it works pretty good . But the purple carols daughter is  a fool & it’s crazy cause the shampoo detangles
6863 2018-12-20 13:57:25 aku nk cepar gemok balik.. fatin, please masak sedap2.. pastu pastikan extra oil
6864 2018-12-20 13:57:17 You're planning a budget base on forecast and speculation of $60 oil price. What happens if the oil price drop to $40?

Some said all things being equal what if all things fails to equal.

You pray for the best while you plan for the worse.
6865 2018-12-20 13:57:15 部屋作った？
6866 2018-12-20 13:57:10 Compared to the oil lobby?
6867 2018-12-20 13:57:06 Maybe if it started 10-20 years ago but a carbon tax doesn’t put big oil out of business in time to prevent a #climatebreakdown. (Look how high cigarette taxes r yet Marlboro still exists) IMO we have 2b at least 80% renewables in the next 5-7 yrs or we’ll be extinct within 25.
6868 2018-12-20 13:57:02 The best thing we could do with the Middle East is to turn it to GLASS .. NUKE IT ALL (Except Israel) and start the gene pool over there! This crap will go on for another 2000 years....the Muslim nutcases will never stop. We don't need the OIL so why are we there?
6869 2018-12-20 13:57:01 James 5:13-14 

Is anyone among you suffering? Let him pray. Is anyone cheerful? Let him sing praise. Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.

And they voted for it

Which is why my pity factor is small

You can’t eat oil 

Or refine it without outside help

Oh yeah, they gave up thier guns

To sustain UAE Golf Arabian countries should start Petrochemical industries to produce Plastic, Paint, Chemical, Petrol, Diesel, Thar etc
6874 2018-12-20 13:56:11 What's well said? She used an example of economic collapse caused by political corruption and an oil economy. Canada has 'socialist' values yet they have the best quality of life in the world, and 'socialist' Scandinavian countries have dominated the top 10 for quite a while now.
6875 2018-12-20 13:56:06 Well cheap oil does a lot the drop inflation.  But I’d like to see food prices drop 10%, starter homes by 20+ so they can be purchased and of course our ridiculous gov’t spending by 30%. I admit cars are doing their level best to drop prices without any help from anyone.
6876 2018-12-20 13:56:01 if you don't want "the government" involved im more than happy to accept a compromise where the government simply stops providing subsidies to driving, road construction and oil production
6877 2018-12-20 13:55:54 ISIS has 8 provinces all over the world, god knows how much gold and Iraqi money from the raiding of banks, and oil they have sold into the black market. So how long are we supposed to stay there in your mind? How long is long enough for the war hawks here in America? 2036?

6881 2018-12-20 13:55:41 The hunting is for a side quest to get exotic itrms for a collector in St Denis. Just done the oil field mission when ***** shows his true colours. I know that ***** is going to ***** me in the ****, but don't tell me. The writing is largely excellent.

6884 2018-12-20 13:55:31 drill, load, and haul are oil intensive in open pit. But there is a lot of oil in indirect costs too, like road maintenance, bussing workers, travel to remote locations, etc etc. If your mine is remote and the plant runs on diesel gen sets costs can be huge (i.e. Tahoe's Escobal)
6885 2018-12-20 13:55:24 These are the things I believe Donald Trump to be:
 
- a traitor
- a thief
- a fraud
- a criminal
- a snake oil salesman
- a racist
- a xenophobe
- a fake Christian
- a sexual predator
- a pervert
- a puppet
- a useful idiot
- a coward
- a liar
- insecure

6887 2018-12-20 13:55:07 It’s all about argan oil!  Packed with omega fatty acids, it's in a brilliant moisturiser that absorbs fast into the skin. It’s lightweight so won’t clog pores and has shown to improve breakouts and acne! Use it on your face or as a body moisturiser for soft, silky skin! 
6888 2018-12-20 13:55:03 President Trump's decision to pull out of Syria is a smart move. I understand your position, and I listen to your radio program, however, Syria is the not the problem. Neither is Russia. This whole war is about Assad not allowing natural gas and oil pipelines thru his country.

6890 2018-12-20 13:54:55 Disagree. Your view is nihilistic & suggests that my correct calls on both oil and gas over the last year were luck or insider knowledge (which I assure you is untrue).
6891 2018-12-20 13:54:47 Like cutting off your nose to spite your face. How does seperation resolve the current oil debate. Alberta is landlocked.
6892 2018-12-20 13:54:39 Appreciate this, i am pretty uninformed when it comes to cars. Had a family member check it and no leaks. Did check the filter and added more oil though

6895 2018-12-20 13:54:32 The reason you are enjoying low gas prices now is because Trump has increased our oil production here. Not as Obama that blocked the Canadian pipeline  and all oil production on our southern coast.

6900 2018-12-20 13:53:59 You are taking already all of the world Oils... You dont need to protection oil wells... Its right desicion... congratulations...
6901 2018-12-20 13:53:55 I don't think it is right that the Minister of Petroleum should be the sole person giving out oil blocks. This is not credible and we have seen it played out in the Malabu Scandal. I support an #OpenOilLicense
6902 2018-12-20 13:53:54 We don't owe any Burger King,Pizza Hut restaurants or we can stop buying Nike instead we buy Adidas. Now, where U.S will buy Cacao to make chocolates, Coffee, Bananas, wood, corn, rubber to make tires, oil and all of your goods? 1 week and you be asking us to tear down that wall
6903 2018-12-20 13:53:42 So no oil leak. Well then, I will dump oil on it just for you.  Xoxo
6904 2018-12-20 13:53:39 Please. It's 100% about jobs and oil workers' feelings.
6905 2018-12-20 13:53:37 The oil companies pay when a pipe bursts, which happens far less then rail spills.  Do you think they just shut a valve and move on?  It a very extensive clean up process.

6910 2018-12-20 13:53:16 I’ve had legitimate loads of organic corn raised on legitimate organic ground using chicken litter and fish oil as the only fertilizer and absolutely no pesticides hauled in a power washed and scrubbed trailer rejected. So what took place here both amazes sometimes angers me.
6911 2018-12-20 13:53:15 The oil patch is propped up by public funds in many ways, including royalty holidays, tax cuts, and other forms of direct and indirect subsidies.
6912 2018-12-20 13:53:10 I love a good oil change it’s like laying in good clean sheets !

6917 2018-12-20 13:52:44 Its not War for oil. Its now War to keep the economy afloat. Debt/interest for the Bankers, War for Jobs, War for Profits, War for Retirement. Everyone PULL EVERY DIME out of all the BANKS, FUNDS, Stocks from ANY Company that profits from WAR.  WAR will END!
6918 2018-12-20 13:52:29 finally getting my car shit situated i need a oil change, tire rotation, and i need my car detailed 
6919 2018-12-20 13:52:27 @CMDMSEDCL sir, @sdo08171 @sepunerural is MSEDCL only for collecting bills?? Is it not responsible for maintenance and oil change of transformers inside societies??
6920 2018-12-20 13:52:19 Not a leap there at all to suggest a majority of hand-picked pollsters who detest the oil & gas industry = majority of Canadians.

6923 2018-12-20 13:52:00 In the link you posted, it said that the other, commercial refineries were doing just fine. So does the growth in crack spread every time oil producers ramp up because they don't bother to think that all that shut down capacity is still waiting to turn back on as well.
6924 2018-12-20 13:51:58 Ain’t it great that we can walk away and not worry about oil!!
6925 2018-12-20 13:51:54 Soon, the rest of Canada will not consume oil to power their vehicles. It's coming  quickly.

6926 2018-12-20 13:51:52 Seriously this #Fake reaction by #TrumpHaters is hilarious. Now they love foreign wars and want to keep troops in #Syria. Probably want our troops everywhere, like all neocons (Ds or Rs) who want more wars for dollars & oil. - & now their #Sheep Baa baa buy it, 3 bags full. #TDS
6927 2018-12-20 13:51:52 I’ve got 70k out of 2 sets of BFG on my 2500 dodge . Rotate them every oil change seems to help

6930 2018-12-20 13:51:32 I love a good oil change !
6931 2018-12-20 13:51:28 Agreed. 1 refrigerator. 1 tv 1 washer. Okay, 7 yrs. 
my Dodge is 4 yrs old. Has an oil leak. Any bets on how expensive it will be to fix? The manufacturers count on your stuff to break. They sell you a warranty, but oh it doesn’t cover that! Or gee your warranty expired. RIPOFF
6932 2018-12-20 13:51:26 Father Mbaka already promise our political leaders that oil prices will rise after the election...So no worries 
6933 2018-12-20 13:51:19 オリーブ油は、毎朝やっているテレビ番組のコーナーでも使っていたりするよね♪
6934 2018-12-20 13:51:16 Yeah for real..lol
So in other countries where they have oil billionaires, we gna as well be water billionaires manje manje
6935 2018-12-20 13:51:09 Great but too many coal and oil bought Congresspeople for this to pass!  Plus trump would never sign!!!  I hope it passes with veto proof majorities!

6937 2018-12-20 13:51:03 They haven't separation plans. As I remember, they asked:
1) Include most SDF factions to SAA,
2) Status for Kurdish language,
3) Part of oil money to rebuild and develop the region.

Glad you mentionbankrupt though.

Scotland will prosper after indy
WM will lose that 92%
You should worry for them not scots
6941 2018-12-20 13:50:54 OIL: Oil prices fell more than 4 percent, hitting their lowest in more than a year on worries about oversupply and the outlook for energy demand as a U.S. interest rate rise knocked stock markets.

I've been with this company for 15 years so I have a charge account. But still. Oil fueled hot water baseboard, pellet stove in basement and propane for kitchen stove and dryer. Came with house. 3 different heats.
6949 2018-12-20 13:49:56 Shocking indeed because it's simply incorrect. Most oil refined in Quebec comes from US and Canada. #cdnpoli #abpoli
6950 2018-12-20 13:49:56 Gold miners may go higher due to support the gold to oil ratio is providing (proxy for operating margins). The ratio is moving up consistently.

6953 2018-12-20 13:49:43 I covered this issue a lot in Colorado as a reporter. Mineral rights are an important right for a landowner, especially in areas with oil and gas resources.

6955 2018-12-20 13:49:32 When recession doesn't come and oil doesn't fall again, inflation talk will resume...and there has been inflation. And/or if govt goes on spending spree (possibly spurred in part by fed doing the right thing), fed will be seen as soaking up inflation rather than preventing it.
6956 2018-12-20 13:49:32 @narendramodi @narendramodi_in @arunjaitley @AmitShah Your government has achieved a gigantic task of bringing the common citizen in the banking system. A matter of pride for all.Sadly nothing for the bank employees who burnt midnight oil to make this happen.
6957 2018-12-20 13:49:27 Wait, isn't the point of a pipeline that there would be less oil transported by truck/rail. Seams like an odd move for the trucking industry.

If the purpose is not more principled than that we should bring them home.

Besides we are now 100% energy independent of that region. Let Europe defend the oil.

6978 2018-12-20 13:47:59 Hi Robin, it's great to see you are looking out through use of palm oil in products. Not all palm oil is grown the same way. Members of RSPO follow a set of standards that include no deforestation, ensuring that palm oil and wildlife can co-exist. 1/2

6982 2018-12-20 13:47:33 The powers that be (trump & Vlad) realize that trump’s time is short. He is only delivering what was originally promised in return for the Russian $$ payoff after leaving office...trump only cares about securing his entitlement to the North Sea oil royalties. It was the long game
6983 2018-12-20 13:47:22 meanwhile the bottom drops out of the price of oil, so let them have that pig in a poke
6984 2018-12-20 13:47:21 The bloody crowd of imbeciles thinking AB leaving Canada is a great idea obviously have no clue about logistics. Good luck AB getting that oil to market when Canada will border you N, E, & W. Idiots.
6985 2018-12-20 13:47:17 EDIFY OIL: Looking at an inside day filled with chop and headfakes.  Trading small and tight w/ moderate ACTIVE exit targets. SNAG profits!
6986 2018-12-20 13:47:16 That didn’t destabilize the region. It was a response to an already destabilizing policy initiative to nationalize oil reserves controlled by foreign powers. Prior to that there were assasinations and an extremist movement gaining footholds in opposition to the shah.
6987 2018-12-20 13:47:16 Charity begins at home! Why should we be so concerned about a people who actually hate us. Let the other UN countries provide them aid. There are lots of oil rich countries that can certainly afford to help them too.

Because we are so self-sufficient in oil & gas, we should ignore OPEC price rigging and set our own prices.

7001 2018-12-20 13:45:54 The oil is devoid of the euphoric substance. It only contains the medicinal ingredients. Smoking marijuana can cause stroke. There’s an abundance of evidence supporting that.

7003 2018-12-20 13:45:42 What they should be protesting is $40/barrel oil.  That’s what will really kill this pipeline.  The oil gravy train is over for Alberta.  Get used to it.
7004 2018-12-20 13:45:42 What about oil, it made a new low but is back above the low now. Do u think the low is in now?

7019 2018-12-20 13:44:41 I'm still wondering wtf is wrong with them. Who are they going to trade with? What happens to oil that is transported through the pipelines in existence & run through other provinces? Doubt anyone will be willing to allow that to continue. What currencies will they use?

7024 2018-12-20 13:44:05 ur right very ST.
I expect a fairly large  Dow/S&P500 rally to take hold soon, Oil will recover fairly well  along with that.
DXY seems to have put in a LT bottom probably, that will be a good tail wind for all commodities.
7025 2018-12-20 13:44:04 Can't remember to whom I might have mentioned thinking #Oil #WTI might have made a near-term bottom ystrdy in $46s. That was said under the psychosis of a #OneAndDone #Fed soo... NEVER MIND. (New low earlier today was only $45.82, tho. Maybe not so far off?)
7026 2018-12-20 13:43:51 If Russia wins Syria they will win the whole Middle East and oil prices will be tremendously higher because it's in the Russian best interests to have oil prices over $100

7032 2018-12-20 13:43:29 If I told the bond bulls they would have a massive collapse in both oil and the SPX in the fall, then said Bonds wouldn't even be positive on the year, they would have locked me up.  
If SPX and oil are discounting the future why not bonds?
7033 2018-12-20 13:43:28 Hope you guys can fix it soon! Add Oil.
7034 2018-12-20 13:43:22 Yes, my heart bleeds for Palestinians (Gazans), Israel is stealing Palestinian Oil and Gas, minerals too, they won`t let it go. This tribe is known well for dirty deeds for centuries..it`s the international commutiry that has to force Israel down on it`s face,

7046 2018-12-20 13:42:07 I stop trading oil it's to difficult for me
7047 2018-12-20 13:42:03 What’s more amazing is that obviously smart people were hoodwinked 2 yrs ago....add stock market down “over years time” which is benchmark,add paying farmers for their losses cause of trade war, add oil prices lower with less reqs but casino and hotel biz is good

7061 2018-12-20 13:41:02 I think your playing down how poor that RNS is worded. Left a lot of questions. Feels like something is not right. After all, I haven’t ever seen an oil co begin production and then stop for Xmas
7062 2018-12-20 13:40:57 No, let’s keep fighting illegal wars for ever! It’s been very good business for weapons manufacturers and the oil and gas industries and how else can you justify an ever increasing military budget? Iran next then onto Russia!
7063 2018-12-20 13:40:45 Key point here is America doesn't need Middle east oil anymore. It specifically doesn't care that Europe does either. He's kicking the can to more local interests.
7064 2018-12-20 13:40:44 I’m going to let time testify how accurate or inaccurate that assumption is.
7065 2018-12-20 13:40:42 If Obama's bragging about making the U.S the largest producer of oil & gas doesn't tell you the dems have had no interest in the environment or global warming, I don't know what argument or proof will.

7074 2018-12-20 13:40:01 Oil is telling the market something isn’t quite right. This move is not driven by fundamentals. Seems liquidity in the global market place is drying.

7078 2018-12-20 13:39:38 Yeah sure. Just like we were treated like liberators in Iraq. These oil rich countries in the Middle East can hire their own Blackwater mercenary army to take on ISIS in their backyards.
7079 2018-12-20 13:39:34 I think the next great invention should be a Ritalin essential oil that I can diffuse in my classroom the day we get out for Christmas. A teacher can dream. #justkidding
7080 2018-12-20 13:39:32 The only “positive” is that they said payzone. Logically they wouldn’t describe it as payzone if they had hit a dud - maybe wishful thinking on my part. Very strange RNS. Never seen an Oil co release an RNS saying we started now we are suspending.
7081 2018-12-20 13:39:32 Nah. You're just another whiner. 
Keep crying. I think there are 1 or 2 people who still haven't heard how terrrrrrrrrrrrible it is for oil workers, soooooooo much worse for them than it has everrrrrrrr been for anyone else everrrrrrrr. 
7082 2018-12-20 13:39:31 Psalm 45:6-7
Your throne, O God, will last for ever and ever; a scepter of justice will be the scepter of your kingdom. You love righteousness and hate wickedness; therefore God, your God, has set you above your companions by anointing you with the oil of joy.

Jesus is God.

7084 2018-12-20 13:39:19 Has anyone not realized that Syria has been holding our oil prices hostage since around the 70's? By pulling out means we no longer have to put up with that crap, let them do what they want to each other, the US is dragging up and coming home.
7085 2018-12-20 13:39:18 Did a plumbing repair in bathroom, suffered water damage. Looking for a few 6 foot oil paintings of the president to use in place of sheetrock. Anyone know of any on the market?
7086 2018-12-20 13:39:17 So long as high-risk, short term careers like sportspeople, gamblers, off-shore oil workers etc can still exist. This gets overlooked in every leftish analysis I've seen of wealth taxation. Killing British sport would not be a good look.
7087 2018-12-20 13:38:58 Writing the word 'sustainable' before palm oil, in my opinion, isn't cluttering the packaging Matt

7102 2018-12-20 13:36:52 Rupee ended stronger against the US Dollar. as crude oil prices fell to the lowest level in over two years. Weakness in Dollar index coupled with the Dollar sales likely by FPI, also supported the sentiment. However, Dollar buys likely for RBI capped gains.

7106 2018-12-20 13:36:36 Government bond prices ended lower today, as MPC minutes suppressed hopes of rate cut anytime soon. Yield on 10-year benchmark failed to sustain below crucial 7.25 mark. Fall in crude oil prices supported the bond prices.

7110 2018-12-20 13:36:20 Indian equities ended lower today, snapping a seven-day rising streak, amid a broad reversal across global markets following Fed's rate hike. A rebound in the rupee and softening crude oil prices cushioned the fall for the domestic markets.

7112 2018-12-20 13:35:57 Trump is dumb but realized what Obama already knew which is that imperialism in a part of the world we don’t understand is costly and unsustainable. Let oil companies hire their own mercenary armies to do their dirty work
7113 2018-12-20 13:35:48 Dear sir, I am not comparing with any political party. I am comparing only the price of petrol. U only see the crude oil by relating to political parties. But when you see crude oil then I have to see other factors such as 1) subsidy, 2) loss by oil companies, 3) unpaid oil debt
7114 2018-12-20 13:35:48 How about “Don, My troops are going to launch a major offensive soon and I don’t want your troops killing mine. I am going to be testing new equipment. No need for us to fight. I’ll make sure you get oil pipelines and seaports! $$ Matter - Thanks - Vladimir”
7115 2018-12-20 13:35:39 I'd say it was.  Still is in some quarters.  

2 / 30 haven't inverted at yet.  30 years have rallied rather grudgingly in context of oil and SPX. 

It's a perfect environment for it.  (Inversion) Why not?
7116 2018-12-20 13:35:36 Anti gravity technologies = no oil cartels, no pollution & free energy. It’s a big step but look at the alternative.

7120 2018-12-20 13:35:03 The answer apparently is "Tax resource extraction on public lands"

Yes, the LWCF is highly important but what happens when public lands are entirely dependent on non renewable resources? What also happens when society moves away from oil and gas into cleaner energy sources?

7132 2018-12-20 13:34:17 It’s not even true statistically when we get 40% of oil from home, 30% Saudi’s Arabia and Canada. Very little comes from “failed states” and I’ll disregard the “unethical involvement” statement as, again, it’s a hollow concept that defies realism in international relations.

7135 2018-12-20 13:34:09 Too many bears these days in the oil market with calls for sub 40, sounding a lot like the calls for 100+ near the peak. Bottom must be close. I'm going to say snap-back rally for oil and the stock market starting today.
7136 2018-12-20 13:34:05 $NTG is not doing too well too but dividends are so tasty and I don't even feel it can go another 10% down....only if oil become cheaper then water:)

7144 2018-12-20 13:33:21 It is no one else's fault that these nation's have not diversified their economies beyond oil. On top of it - most of them have spent it lavishly on subsidies and other benefits like the boom will last forever. Serves them right.

7149 2018-12-20 13:32:58 The best for us would be that there would be no precipitate withdrawal from Arabia...till we have got off oil...at least middle east oil...also that Japan is allowed to come out of US shadows..meantime Trump continuing a quasi civil war with the liberal deep state...
7150 2018-12-20 13:32:58 Illegal aliens should get out of Syria. What are your French interests inside Syria? Oil?

7157 2018-12-20 13:32:25 Jason forgets as well that in this case all the governments have to do is stop intervention.  Stop interventions of a small group funded by outsiders, allow pipelines to be built, and the market will achieve what he proposes. I.e businesses buying Canadian oil.

7162 2018-12-20 13:32:14 Super great idea. . Considering Trudeau wants to shove a Carbon Tax onto farmers too. And trains should be hauling Ag products , not oil. That’s what pipelines are for.

7170 2018-12-20 13:31:38 Except telling us how much oil they have is meaningless if it doesn’t result in cheaper price at the pump. Historically, gas prices are better in the absence of violent uprisings so it makes no sense to say we cause conflict for oil.

7172 2018-12-20 13:31:24 Yesterday’s oil & gas convoy was clearly a very polarizing experience.

7185 2018-12-20 13:30:06 Any hopes of respite for oil traders were dashed this morning when the commodity fell again. A barrel of Brent crude oil was trading under US$ 55. Saudi Arabia’s Energy Minister blamed a range of factors including US$ strength & investor speculation for the moves

7192 2018-12-20 13:29:24 What's the big deal in producing our own oil?

7211 2018-12-20 13:27:33 Sure, pull out of Syria...Then, turn your attention to ending the Maduro communist regime in Venezuela. THAT is close to home at just 1300 miles: they hold the world’s largest oil reserves; and, the Russians and Chinese are all over it already. Priorities!! #oil #venezuela
7212 2018-12-20 13:27:21 Nah they gone be good the oil pipeline in Seria has been secured that’s all that means plus dropped sanctions against his Russian teammates that’s why he made the distraction video to keep that quiet

7230 2018-12-20 13:26:19 When my heater kicked on, I realized that my house burns as many fossil fuels--or more-- than my car. I rent, so the choice of heating system isn't under my control. I know much of the NE runs on fuel oil, so our regional carbon footprint is substantial.
7231 2018-12-20 13:26:16 In as much as budget is done based on  planning and forecast, note that  With speculation, the risk of loss is more than offset by the possibility of a huge gain. Otherwise there would be very little motivation to speculate. We should keep hoping for oil to go up. Useless country

that going into Iraq was a oil grab by big companies.Televised after 9/11.
7234 2018-12-20 13:25:56 I guess not so let Russia and Iran take over. Better start funding electric cars and alternative energy. You just lost oil.
7235 2018-12-20 13:25:52 Our power grid can’t currently support that amount of electric cars. They may very well be the future but how do you we prepose we get there? 
Gasoline and diesel aren’t the only uses for oil though. That electric car for example is littered with products and energy from oil.
7236 2018-12-20 13:25:49 Between oil and dynamics there must be an engine. Issues are then the quality of oil, quality of the engine (as user of oil and powering dynamics), quality the oil/engine couple, ...and quality of dynamics in relation to purpose?

7241 2018-12-20 13:25:24 これは箱買いか？！
7242 2018-12-20 13:25:23 Yes, but what the public doesn’t consider is cost. A $4.5B pipeline can move 800kbl/d of oil and have a significant impact on differentials and therefore economic impact. Alternatively, the RedWater refinery cost $9.5B and will process 80kbld. Whose paying for it?
7243 2018-12-20 13:25:17 Sounds like a roughneck on an oil rigs.
7244 2018-12-20 13:25:10 Funny how the talk of shutting down the oil and gas to BC stopped immediately after the feds bought TMX. It will never be built, and the liberals will keep there seats in BC. Not bought to help Alberta just to shut us up and phase us out!
7245 2018-12-20 13:25:08 Yes, there should be more in the bank however the Norwegians never had to pay $220 Billion in transfer payments to the Feds to be redistributed to our brothers and sisters in other parts of Canada.  Every CANADIAN  has benefited over decades from Alberta’s oil. From sea to sea!

7248 2018-12-20 13:24:57 Syria's "richest" oil wells are still dirt poor. All of Syria could produce maybe 1% of the oil Iraq does, if they tried their hardest.
7249 2018-12-20 13:24:54 I made cute Christmas themed scrubs after I stopped crying about coconut oil and dad took me up to Coles to buy some refined ones. I think one of my goals in 2019 is to start selling my scrubs to more than just friends ? I mean I think they’re pretty great
7250 2018-12-20 13:24:50 I agree. It's not been a priority & the focus of US from middle East is drifting away as their reduce their reliance on crude oil from this region. Only China & Russia involvement in this region will see the NATO & especially US trying to play a passive role in the coming years.
7251 2018-12-20 13:24:49 You can't talk about TDD in the abstract. You would need to consider the skill and experience levels of the practitioners, the languages and tooling, the broader architectural and domain context, Cynefin domains, lots of other factors. Lots of scope for hand-waving and snake oil.

7259 2018-12-20 13:24:20 Alberta oil has to keep moving - I support yesterday’s message - but I do NOT agree HOW it was delivered. Unless pissing off pipeline supporters is now a thing.
‘Coulda, woulda, shoulda’ retorts miss the point.
7260 2018-12-20 13:24:14 We also need to refine and use our own oil and stop giving it away to the USA. We could then sell to world markets and make a profit.
7261 2018-12-20 13:24:12 Norway made money off their oil and gas industry and put that money towards building new cleaner energy options. Canada can’t do that if we spend all our money buying other countries oil instead of producing our own. Money management. It’s a thing.
7262 2018-12-20 13:24:07 On a completely different note, one of our favorites is whipped salt cod on polenta (Enoteca cookbook). Basically boil cod, drain, and mix in a food processor with ample olive oil, garlic, parsley, and pepper. So good.

7272 2018-12-20 13:23:27 The oil and steel embargo was enacted to stop these material from feeding the Japanese war machine which was marching across China and butchering the Chinese, and that was only the first step in Japan’s march for Co-prosperity Sphere, a Japanese empire by another name.
7273 2018-12-20 13:23:26 Finally! Ive been saying for a while now, that Alberta has a PR crisis that needs to be addressed. Other Canadians don't inherently dislike a Canadian oil industry, but saddled with racism and homophobia, the rest of Canada decides to ignore Alberta.

7333 2018-12-20 13:18:12 Prime Minister Scheer’s foreign policy, so far:

1. Keep Saudi Arabia’s LRV money, stop giving them our oil money. Pray they don’t notice. 

2. Make angry phone calls to Chinese President demanding return of Canadians. If that doesn’t work, call again using “Dad voice”.

7356 2018-12-20 13:15:18 . Our crude  oil production is about 1.96 million barrels per day which is already 400 000 barrels shortage per day. Same oil is 57.24 USD as at today which means we have about 2.76 USD shortage. You can't base ur budget on overtime instead of the real salary. Buharinomics

7358 2018-12-20 13:14:59 @WayneMcCurrie @ArabileG forecast - oil price will weaken further, quite possibly going to $20 p/b. Gold will strengthen - $2000 or more. Keep this.

It also deters China and/or Russia coming in and cutting oil supplies to jeopardize the US's energy security.

7374 2018-12-20 13:13:45 That was a horrific rail incident.  Alberta is pleading to build a pipeline that would prevent such incidences.  Quebec seems to have zero issues with piping sewage into Canada's natural waterways.  Can't see why a monitored oil pipeline is such a huge issue.
7375 2018-12-20 13:13:36 @narendramodi @narendramodi_in Plz let all citizen know the reduction in MRP rates in all items like, edible oil, packed food items, daal, rice,aata,soap, shampoo, milk, milk products, and all daily used items, etc #MannKiBaat lets see the effect of GST #GST
7376 2018-12-20 13:13:30 It?s been 1,000 days since the BP oil spill and the Gulf of Mexico still has not been restored. #PushAwardsLizQuens #KCA #facts #funfacts
7377 2018-12-20 13:13:23 Following the necessary infrastructure works in 2019, the Puesto Prado battery will be reactivated to allow the oil to be sold to nearby refineries #Progress

7383 2018-12-20 13:12:36 more safe. I guess. But what's our real motive? Oil I guess?
7384 2018-12-20 13:12:26 I actually like it when it's night time, makes it a bit spookier. But how do we light torches? We need oil??
7385 2018-12-20 13:12:22 Ini face oil nder, lumayan sih kalo pagi pake ini terus pake bedak kaya glowing gitu sih
7386 2018-12-20 13:12:21 Breakfast idea! Saute shallots in olive oil and garlic until fragrant. Add pork mince and onion and marinara sauce. Cook thoroughly. Serve with ciabatta and a bit of lime.
7387 2018-12-20 13:12:20 @POTUS Koch Bros need to help desperate Albertans!  Trudeau imports to Canada billions in oil from Saudi Arabia! As if oil-rich Canada needs this!  Throws Albertans out of work Big Time. Yet Saudi Arabia is only Canada's 5th largest oil importer (10%) Top 4 are Kn Algeria, Nor UK
7388 2018-12-20 13:12:17 If you did need oil and couldn’t make it town don’t worry 
The oil men got a new location at Sheraton
7389 2018-12-20 13:12:05 Only if there's oil involved eh Don ?

7395 2018-12-20 13:11:19 Putin hates Trump’s oil exploration too.
7396 2018-12-20 13:11:16 You are the epitome of a snake oil salesman.
7397 2018-12-20 13:11:15 Now we know who to give the credit to when Putin annexes Syria...and oil prices shoot up.
7398 2018-12-20 13:10:52 Looking for last minute gifts? We have cutting boards, cutting board oil, t-shirts and giddies for sale. Pick up only. Give us a holler if you are interested. Happy Hollerdays! 
7399 2018-12-20 13:10:48 Thank you so much for this (sometimes I have an overactive mind at bedtime)! I've been wanting natural melatonin and not the pills. In addition to diet and exercise, I use Lavender Essential oil on the chest before bedtime.

7401 2018-12-20 13:10:46 
 #National Iranian Oil Company ( #NIOC) firmly denied a story covered on Chilean prosecutors alleging possible Iranian oil link to intoxications in ENAP refinery.
7402 2018-12-20 13:10:32 It all has to do with methane. If you alter the timeframe enough, you can make methane far more "expensive" of a GHG than carbon. Then you can tax cow farts until meat is too expensive. Has side effect of making tax on actual oil carbon emissions very low.
7403 2018-12-20 13:10:30 Can't help but notice Russian economic interests (OIL), dovetails conveniently with OIL money(Koch) that runs FOX State News 
7404 2018-12-20 13:10:24 My family was driving across central Texas looking for something to do. We got an oil change we didn’t need. We met dangerous-seeming people and shared a hotel room with them. It felt like a Tarantino movie. I just wanted to go home. #dansdreams

7406 2018-12-20 13:10:12 The only people in this country not hurting are Trudeau and his delusional and brainwashed supporters, I'm from Ontario I have family in Alberta I lived in Calgary and people from all over Canada work in the oil fields, so I fully support Alberta but separation is not the way

7410 2018-12-20 13:09:54 More oil production leads to more oil consumption. Sure we make profit, but at what cost? Climate change effects us all, regardless if we use that oil, or another nation does. What price is worth oil spills and cleanup? For many Canadians, there is no dollar figure.
7411 2018-12-20 13:09:50 #ISIS thrived under #Obama.He allowed them to trade oil with #Turkey . #Russia put an end to that, and it was basically #Russia that took care of #Isis . The #USA hampered Russian efforts to clean up #Syria
#Trump decision to pool troops out of Syria makes a lot of sense
7412 2018-12-20 13:09:45 You would look dazzling if you shoot clip by applying Oil on your skin 
7413 2018-12-20 13:09:38 Oil demand and use has been and is continuing to rise. Look it up. Just because Jane Fonda says so does make it true
7414 2018-12-20 13:09:35 My girlfriend heard a rumour, that i slept with the neighbour. I did try to explain but  she is busy cooking oil in the pot . I think she is gonna make  breakfast for us. . .love her so much.
7415 2018-12-20 13:09:34 @JustinTrudeau  Justin nice move; u give away billions and give Quebec all the transfer payments then table a LOAN for our oil industry lmao we are praying u don’t get back in next term
7416 2018-12-20 13:09:34 Where will you buy your snake oil from now?
7417 2018-12-20 13:09:19 That's a great move! The Russia-phobia among Americans is so ridiculous. It is NOT a superpower. Russia's GDP is even smaller than Italy's. And with the dropping of crude oil price, they have much more trouble to handle.

7419 2018-12-20 13:09:15 It’s almost as if pulling out of the Iran deal was just to shift demand for oil from Iran to, oh I don’t know, Russia.

And the Saudis.

It’s not like oil is the only engine running the Russian economy.

And the Saudis.

7424 2018-12-20 13:08:43 The #Oil slide continues. Premarket trading has futures contract at $46.5 per barrel. $UCO The RSI on the daily chart is slightly above oversold at 31.5547.
7425 2018-12-20 13:08:37 Electric car on way mate, don’t get above yourself. Things are good at moment but that can change, LFC been on floor for 20 years now back even stronger.  Let’s see how city cope when they have a down turn, are they able to come back because before oil money answer was no.
7426 2018-12-20 13:08:23 The Russians aren't our pals, but China is a much bigger problem. Russia's military is not as advanced as ours & their economy is based mostly on oil & gas. We can crush them on energy. Putin loves to boast to 3rd world that he is so strong he even interfered w/US elections.
7427 2018-12-20 13:08:21 So stealing oil and killing kids and women and helping dectators oppressing innocents is 'protecting the middle east'  thanks
7428 2018-12-20 13:08:20 Nigerians should brace up. There is nothing like excess crude again. Oil price is currently $55/barrel for Brent. The era of oil is about to end. It is time we started diversifying this economy, FAST!
7429 2018-12-20 13:08:17 there’s always that great moment in stories of towns being duped by snake oil salesmen when they finally figure it out and run him put of town.  let’s hope this is the beginning of that scene.
7430 2018-12-20 13:08:12 The dude that changes my oil literally has no emotion 
7431 2018-12-20 13:07:44 We can use the oil from our National Parks to keep the wall going
7432 2018-12-20 13:07:43 The snake oil has reached my in boxes.. Where we at, wave 3 on this lil pump?
7433 2018-12-20 13:07:35 It is very interesting but I dont believe in fundamentals on oil. EIA, IEA, OPEC and other agencies themselves don't know exact numbers about demand and supply. It is all about Wall Street who sets the price.
7434 2018-12-20 13:07:08 Be useful if you’re changing the oil in the car! Catch the drips!
7435 2018-12-20 13:07:08 Agree. I work in a car oil change service and some customers I get are ultimately jerks and think they're entitled to be jerks towards us. This harassment is pointless, really.
7436 2018-12-20 13:07:08 Waistline wan some oil or wd-40.
7437 2018-12-20 13:07:04 いくんですね……羨ましいです……またの機会にします……ぐすんぐすん……わたしの分まで楽しんできてくださいぐすんぐすん……。
7438 2018-12-20 13:07:03 Oh Donald,  you know that American presence in the middle east is strictly to support big oil interests. Big oil created the monster. Is troops support it.
7439 2018-12-20 13:06:41 Even this Suburban FL mom heard Kerry’s 2016 recording re Syria. Obama enabled ISIS to topple Assad. Claim US there to fight ISIS- but regime change and OIL! Trump Calls Bluff. “We are not Nation Building, we are killing terrorists” Your donors must be mad! Transparent, Senator.
7440 2018-12-20 13:06:38 Hinahanap ko yung oil control sheet, at pinagbintangan ko ang malikot kong pinsan:
Ako: Oy ikaw, na  pangahas ka, tinangka mo bang bihagin ang natatangi kong yaman?
Sya: bakit ko naman kukunin yon wala makinis naman ako.

At ako'y natulala. Double kill awwww. Why so mean?
7441 2018-12-20 13:06:32 It's either that or bonds. A war in the ME would probably raise oil prices too
7442 2018-12-20 13:06:27 if Oil stays at below $55 ...Recession

if Oil stays at below $45 ...Depression
7443 2018-12-20 13:06:23 #AAOG Drill bit must be covered in oil by now , 
7444 2018-12-20 13:06:16 International rules on coastal waters apply. An independent Scotland would have most of the oil fields under Scottish waters. Westminster can demand what it likes. It can’t overrule international rules. The debt is UK debt not Scotland’s.
7445 2018-12-20 13:06:16 Try Belgomarkt :) At a lot of organic bio/stores (incl. Farm) you can also refill your washing liquid bottles and the like. The Juttu store also sells cleaning products from Seepje, which does include plastic, but the cleaning products are made without any palm oil etc
7446 2018-12-20 13:06:13 I see that but I did look at some charts last night and I see those same divergences on oil.  They don’t mean much when we’re embedded, but I think we’re close to a massive bounce in everything if not a sustainable rally into 2019.
7447 2018-12-20 13:06:07 A withdrawal from Syria gives Russia a Trurkey through Syria and Iran an alliance potential.......for small tactical nukes sales.  Russian nuke sales to Iran in exchange for oil and war supplies deals....... a Cuban Missile Crisis!  Right out of Cruschev's playbook.
7448 2018-12-20 13:06:02 If you talking about your natural  hair then try using castor oil .
7449 2018-12-20 13:05:48 my hair have almost reached thighs. And my mom massages my scalp with warm fresh milk and garlic oil.  you can laugh it you want but its realllly effective

You are awesome, have a great day and happy holidays to you and yours!  
Ain't life grand?
7454 2018-12-20 13:05:17 C'mon, what's a bot gotta do to get an oil fix around here?
7455 2018-12-20 13:05:09 You can try a different brand too. Rn I use plus CBD oil 3mg but my massage therapist has one with 800mg. And his brand is more pure so it’s a double strong for me.
7456 2018-12-20 13:05:04 But I keep wondering why Paul Bear of Cameroon is still allowed to continue his reign. Is it because he is not considered a threat and probably no enough oil well in that country?
7457 2018-12-20 13:04:59 Come on joker, your caravan is/was so far away that it couldn’t have made it anywhere close yet. You’re a clown, snake oil salesman, loon on the L. Go watch TV
7458 2018-12-20 13:04:56 OK. The oil ban vote seems like a red flag given donations to his campaign from oil company executives.

7467 2018-12-20 13:04:08 Still bothered by last night’s panini fail. I was a bit too generous with the butter and/or olive oil and/or pepper relish and it ended up with a soggy bottom. 

But on the upside, I have named the sammich the George Clooney.
7468 2018-12-20 13:03:59 That is another angle/incentive for USA and Saudi involvement... Oil highways/ pipeline wars.
7469 2018-12-20 13:03:47 'In occupying northeastern Syria, the US military and its proxies have seized control over roughly a third of the country, including, most crucially, Syria’s oil and natural gas fields as well as its eastern border with Iraq. '
7470 2018-12-20 13:03:42 I dunno, maybe a precursor of things to come?? Notley is asking for more rail cars now to transport oil. Isn’t trains and trucks polluting the air worse than a pipeline?
7471 2018-12-20 13:03:40 Pump the oil out of the ground and transfer with pipelines. This is the cheapest way to keep our country strong and moving forward. Why pay the Saudis what we have right here?
7472 2018-12-20 13:03:36 Oil and destabilization.

7476 2018-12-20 13:02:56 Well of course, Trump just gave him a New Years gift with 1/3 of Syria up for grabs in the withdrawal. They need to refocus on grabbing those oil fields along Euphrates before focusing on Ukraine again.
7477 2018-12-20 13:02:41 Petrol prices are not under gov control but they can decrease it by decreasing taxes or investing in oil exploration and it's technology

7479 2018-12-20 13:02:28 US troops are/were in Syria to serve other purposes and defeating Isis was not one of them. Securing and robbing the oil was priority number one.

7505 2018-12-20 12:59:41 Why does Alberta think that they are more important that the other provinces... they want to run pipelines through other provinces without concern or regard for their populations... ask the ppl of Lac-Mégantic  about oil running through Quebec... where was your outcry then?

Ебаааа... Ну, я и недалёкая... Блэт, мне сейчас невероятно стыдно, из-за того, что я не знала... Даже не знаю, как и извиниться, потому что это, блин, невероятно ужасный поступок с моей стороны((((
7510 2018-12-20 12:59:07 I am shocked by this drone activity; but what about the Oil drilling and wastewater reinjection in Surrey, that has caused earthquakes this year,  just 4,000 metres from Gatwick!!! You should oppose the extraction of fossil fuels nr Gatwick, if you cared about passenger safety !

7515 2018-12-20 12:58:50 Given global meltdown, spike in 2008-09 would have happened,even if Namo was the PM then . And fiscal deficit #s began dropping well in the UPAs time. Drop since 2014 would have also largely happened with crude oil crash. Classic, Heads U loose, tails I win! Bhaktness  at peaks!

One thing we can be sure, #America , #Russia , #Saudi nationals will see none of it. This is for #Oligarchs .
7517 2018-12-20 12:58:22 Albertans don't want handouts.  They want the Trudeau to stop throwing up roadblocks. Why does he love petro-dictators so much that he happily imports oil from human rights abusers rather than let Canadians use their own?

 I thought this was completely obvious.
7530 2018-12-20 12:55:54 Now it’s Russia’s well deserved problem. This is a path to helping break down the Russian economy. Putin is way over extended financial and low oil price helps to ensure puttin Putin in cage.

7538 2018-12-20 12:55:30 The bigger issue is our SDF partners, Eastern Syria and the oil we and our partners have fought so hard to secure. Russia wants this land and will go after it as soon as we leave. SDF can do nothing without our support and we will lose everything we fought for. France is in North
7539 2018-12-20 12:55:15 What to use in Lieu of Pesticides? Neem Oil, Garlic & Clove Oil, Azatrol, StrawFlower Extract... the list goes on!

7541 2018-12-20 12:55:02 If the rates of Petrol &Deseal are based on Crude oil rates,How it is justified that during last week the  petrol rates see rise and Deseal rates decrease. Can any one clear .
7542 2018-12-20 12:54:58 Just a point: polyester - which is the basis for many cloth materials is not a green product. It is oil and coal based and its manufacture produces hydrocarbon pollutants.
7543 2018-12-20 12:54:58 Now that I hear why you are getting out -I agree with your decision. Let them fight ISIS and we bring our troops home. We don’t need their oil anymore! That was the reason we were there in the first place - protecting oil supply.
7544 2018-12-20 12:54:53 Secret is lots of coconut milk + a generous amount of coconut oil for the sautéed whole spices. Fat is flavour. Obviously shouldn’t be eating this every day lol
7545 2018-12-20 12:54:47 And Putin agrees, as he prepares to run an oil pipeline through Syria.
7546 2018-12-20 12:54:37 The only downside trying to get a little exercise during my NYC commute everyday is when I sprint up three flights of stairs and surface from the subway to be greeted by an empanada foodtruck. As I am catching my breath, my lungs are coated with vaporized canola oil from a fryer.

7550 2018-12-20 12:54:03 Ok FACTS AGIAN;

Midle east controls 60% of oil.
 The USA WILL NOT BE ABLE TO HOLD A EVASION FORCE OFF WITHOUT OIL RESERVES.

7556 2018-12-20 12:53:40 At coffee break during a meeting at AGIP (Italian oil company) in Nigeria, an Italian geophysicist asked me “are there any Italians in Scotland?  I told him there are so many, are there any left in Italy?  As evidence, I gave the names of three school friends - all Scots Italian.

7562 2018-12-20 12:52:55 And as for trump saying they’ve ‘won, beaten them badly’. Lol clearly means the pipelines have been laid, their oil can now be stolen
7563 2018-12-20 12:52:49 Trudeau can say one thing and the opposite in the following interview.  He's for carbon taxes, the Paris Green according and for more oil at the same time. 
He's a buffoon.

7578 2018-12-20 12:51:26 @BBC_HaveYourSay Shame that Oil drilling in Surrey is not being banned for the safey of the air travellers in the UK. 14 earthquakes in Newdigate, Surrey, earlier this year from wastewater re-injection related to the process of Oil extraction. 4,000 metres from Gatwick!!!! Crazy!
7579 2018-12-20 12:51:26 Doesn't go far enough. Saudi Arabia needs serious sanctions. No more purchase of their oil. No more weapons at all.

7581 2018-12-20 12:51:07 Moreover PSO is an oil@marketing company and it cannot legally sign any LNG contract other than POL.
PSO doesn't have the mandate as per Oil Rules, 2016 because LNG is Not a Petroleum product according to the GOP Notification

7584 2018-12-20 12:50:05 Starts out as a "big corporation Vs man who find oil", takes a sharp turn to space salvage; random collapsing building. This is what happens if you don't staple the pages of the scripts in your studio.
7585 2018-12-20 12:49:55 Lol. Guess you need some oil to help your response.
7586 2018-12-20 12:49:52 With recession forecast to hit the U.S next year and slowing growth in China, coupled with brexit, expect oil to trade below $50 a barrel in 2019.
7587 2018-12-20 12:49:49 Malam olip oil/?
7588 2018-12-20 12:49:45 มีความสุขจริงๆเด็กน้อย
7589 2018-12-20 12:49:36 Price of Oil has fallen again by $ 3.50 this morning ( over 40% so far on the past few weeks) ! Every $ change in CRUDE oil price impacts import bill by Rs 823 Crores. Same impact when Rs rate vs $ ! Rupee has strengthened from 72.5 to 69.5 in last 1 month , increasing benefit.
7590 2018-12-20 12:49:26 Now let me get this straight. The Feds aren’t in “Oil business” but they own a pipeline courtesy of taxpayers funds, but haven’t done a thing to press the project forward. Whose “disingenuous “? ...and stupid?
7591 2018-12-20 12:49:22 If they tried to take them with American soldiers statiomed close by, why would they not try when there is no American presence? Its common sense. Assad needs the oil revenue to rebuild everything he destroyed
7592 2018-12-20 12:49:16 I wonder who Paul Ryan will be lobbying for after leaving the US in shambles - big oil, big insurance, Russia?
7593 2018-12-20 12:49:15 Are you a reporter or documentary film maker trying you hardest to prove negative to Tesla over big oil? In your dreams. Fight a better fight
7594 2018-12-20 12:49:14 Can't see why you can't take the oil once you've helped them and bring some Christian morals to their schools. Like game of thrones over there. About 200 years behind.
7595 2018-12-20 12:49:13 Sir, time to fix the FED. We need 27 more days like the last 4 days and the DOW will be ZERO. Powell and his team don’t make sense. Why raise rates when GDP is slowing, oil is crashing, retail (aka Costco) is crashing, and we are jabbing China?

7598 2018-12-20 12:49:00 I keep checking sources to see if there is any fall off in oil demand (there is not). Fed talking tough out of one side of it's mouth, but hitting oil to create a new QE or ZIRP.

7604 2018-12-20 12:48:48 Climate change is a snake oil ruse. There is no science experiment that proves the greenhouse effect. They’re explained away with specific heat capacity which says the temperature change is inconsequential. Bottles and cars are not gases.

The Ruskies win! Who knew a American President would assist Russia in monopolizing the global oil market.
7607 2018-12-20 12:48:26 You honestly think Assad and Russia will watch as the Kurds/Syriacs/Turkmen possess those oil fields? They wont even have heavy weaponry to defend themselves from the impending attack.

7618 2018-12-20 12:47:54 Suddenly the USA doesn't appear to be interested in oil anymore. Lets see how that goes for you.
7619 2018-12-20 12:47:51 Interesting. The instructions that came with the pans specify flaxseed oil as the preferred oil. (I was told this was the same bottle of oil just used to re-season a wrecked cast iron pan to perfection about a month ago as well. But that was done in the oven, not stovetop.)

Turkey also bought oil from ISIS, who used the money to fund themselves.
7628 2018-12-20 12:46:54 Reported by The Guardian:  July 2018: “Donald Trump was condemned as “treasonous” for siding with the Kremlin in a press conference that included discussions about election meddling, oil pipelines, Syria, Crimea and nuclear power.”

7631 2018-12-20 12:46:46 You people are ridiculously stupid. Russia is getting 25% of Syrian oil. US and SDF has most of it and when we leave Russia will invade SDF and take the rest. Americans have fought and died to secure land for Russia, this is beautiful for some of you i guess.
7632 2018-12-20 12:46:46 I will bet on thebond market & the many signals like weak housing & autos & sharply declining oil prices among many others. Fed is late to recognize as usual due to backward looking data. Big policy error if they don't reverse soon. Not about propping up the stock market.
7633 2018-12-20 12:46:36 Like this? LATEST UPDATE: OPEC/UNFCCC ended talks in [city] without a deal on oil production/carbon emission cuts as the size of [Country A’s] contribution (and exemption requests from [Country B] and other nations) remained a sticking point before further talks on Friday
7634 2018-12-20 12:46:26 At some point people understand this is political. This feels like an attempt to create ZIRP using cheap oil.
7635 2018-12-20 12:46:17 What you are lying about those people are asylum seekers! Our country created this God damn mess! It's why all refugees and illegals are coming! We are the reason they're coming here in the first place dumbass! No more fossil fuel! Biofuel and synthetic oil is what we need! HEMP!

7641 2018-12-20 12:45:49 yeah, the gummies I was taking worked pretty damn well. Not sure the oil absorbs the same. I'm not feeling the same effect but we'll see. I might try increasing more.
7642 2018-12-20 12:45:44 If i was an the enemy of the state and a group in a field could get rid of the drones I'd be very afraid.

7649 2018-12-20 12:44:58 If you let the middle East alone it most likely will grow further and further into a mess for the USA. Watch when Russia and China become the major powers in.the area and tell the oil producers no more oil to USA.

7656 2018-12-20 12:44:16 I’ve wondered about oil. I started taking gummies after my second shingles attack this fall because anxiety is an asshole. Shame you can’t find them. :(
7657 2018-12-20 12:44:13 last day of sun, literally got the oil everywhere for some final tan time. 
7658 2018-12-20 12:44:11 Who asked him or his governments to be the policemen of the world or the middle east. It seems that the his is facing disappointment on oil supply.

7670 2018-12-20 12:43:08 Yes - we do export some oil. That does not make us a net exporter or energy independent
7671 2018-12-20 12:43:07 3. Im sure Putin will happily throw Iran under the bus if US attacks, esp if he just been given Syria and hence seat at top table in Middle East

plus attack on Iran will send oil prices soaring...
7672 2018-12-20 12:43:05 I think about what would happen if I put La Croix in my oil diffuser instead of water approximately 14 times a day.

7685 2018-12-20 12:41:38 They could but that would not assist the free market.  Pipelines are not something any other province is seeking.  Therein lies the problem.  The other is that the oil companies get better cleaner cheaper oil and they do that, that is the market that drives value not us.

7690 2018-12-20 12:40:57 It is to call out the government to review the Oil Licensing Process in Nigeria. Presently, the minister of petroleum can give out oil blocks to just about anybody he wants. Check #OpenOilLicense for more

Oil, and particularly OPEC, is in an inexorable decline... for many of the reasons you wisely enumerate: over supply due to improving technology;
7693 2018-12-20 12:40:47 When will Ghanaians stop calling plastic bags rubber? Its made from oil, not from the bark of a tree, its flipping plastic bag. Try stretching that plastic bag and see what happens, it tears, its not elastic like rubber. Rubber is the thing you have in a bicycle tire.

7695 2018-12-20 12:40:42 #JKX Wont do much until Ukraine has elections on 31st March 2019 maybe sooner but only if he releases those sailors. Oil prices are paramount for oilers, obviously, regardless of how much cash they have because sector sentiment is also paramount. All will fly then..........
7696 2018-12-20 12:40:42 ... projected slower demand (due to the cooling global economy); and its a fuel that is no longer necessary any longer. #GreenNewDeal

The sooner oil goes, the sooner the US can get out of the Middle East, and end credit card wars.

7724 2018-12-20 12:38:21 LMAO. So Putin himself said he welcomes US leaving Syria. That means he now gets a larger stake of the oil. Russia getting 25% of Syrian oil but only what they control. We control most of it and we're giving it away. How smart is that? #TrumpgivingRussiaSyrianoil

7736 2018-12-20 12:37:13 What you’re watching folks is the President of the United States actively seeking to make Russia the most powerful country in the world. Pulling out of Syria creates space for Russia to move in and monopolize crude oil prices globally. A “stable genius” would know that.

7772 2018-12-20 12:33:48 I pop in to visit my Aunt for a cup of tea and she insists on feeding me and giving me a tub of homemade biscuits, a gallon of olive oil and some halloumi. Greek Aunts can NEVER accept ‘No’ for an answer!
7773 2018-12-20 12:33:38 insensible. What ?: "Oil is not enough or the territory is divided?". Unsubscribe, read.
7774 2018-12-20 12:33:32 After paying 4.5 billion to kinder Morgan,10 billion to rebuild an old pipeline and 1.6 billion to oil companies subsidies. Is that climate change?
7775 2018-12-20 12:33:31 I’m going to bet though that of the many people that work in the Oil Industry in Canada there are probably racists.  Just like any other industry including mine and yours.
7776 2018-12-20 12:33:31 Le rapport n'a jamais prédit la fin du pétrole dans les années 2000...
Il précisait juste l'état des estimations officielles de l'époque.

Sinon dans le rapport, la notion de pic oil est incluse dans celui des ressources non renouvelables.
7777 2018-12-20 12:33:18 The other some chick was spread wide open with a wand and some oil just going at it
7778 2018-12-20 12:33:03 I have followed FCEVs since the 90s. I was a hardcore advocate for FCEVs until mid 2000 when it became clear that this is a hoax. Legacy automakers and oil&gas companies are trying to convince policy makers to support FCEVs in order to ensure a continuation of their dominance
7779 2018-12-20 12:33:02 It is as i said oil down to 45.00 a barrel. DOW down to 23,500 to 23,700. Three months ago i made predictions. Three flags danger
7780 2018-12-20 12:33:00 That’s probably why they overwhelmingly buy *drum roll* .... Canadian oil!

Also they don’t buy any Saudi oil, so stop “misleading” people Mr. Kenney, it’s time you gave being open and honest a try.
7781 2018-12-20 12:32:57 Its called a conflict. Educate yourself. More importantly, little conflict remains. We've secured most of the syrian oil that your President is handing to Russia who is getting 25% of Syria oil instead of asking SDF to help pay for American services.
7782 2018-12-20 12:32:31 I need someone to change my oil. Would you be so kind? It goes in through here... *spreads legs*
7783 2018-12-20 12:32:28 No way we double Permian production in the next two years without substantial improvement in oil price. Midland realizations are currently less than $40 / bbl.
7784 2018-12-20 12:32:28 I’m currently trying this one oil to replace my moisturizer. Let’s see how it goes. So far my face is not greasy and feeling baby butt smuv.
7785 2018-12-20 12:32:24 I can’t afford heating oil. We have minimum delivery amounts, I would have to put out $1800 for my first delivery. I have small propane heaters in the house this year.

7790 2018-12-20 12:32:14 Justin is so ill-equipped to deal with serious matters. He should have kept his mouth shut, sold the equipment as per the contract, approved the Energy East pipeline and then weaned Canada off Saudi Oil. Would have been a WIN/WIN/WIN - @JustinTrudeau just not ready for this job
7791 2018-12-20 12:31:35 It is such a slap in the face to Islam the slightest spark will ignite the area giving Putin control of the world’s remaining oil and gas supplies. Trump has destabilized the region

7793 2018-12-20 12:31:33 We are over 100 million in this country and yet one man gets to decide how to share our oil blocks?? How's that even right? Make Oil Licensing Process transparent and let competent people be in charge. 
#OpenOilLicense
7794 2018-12-20 12:31:32 Oil, and particularly OPEC, is in an inexorable decline... for many of the reasons you wisely enumerate: over supply due to improving technology; projected slower demand (due to the cooling global economy); and its a fuel that is no longer necessary any longer. #GreenNewDeal
7795 2018-12-20 12:31:28 Come on....you know we are only overseas with troops deployed for oil control, pretty simple shit here Donnie

7798 2018-12-20 12:31:22 Me I don't even know if this our ECA is a magical conundrum from Hogwarts; the VP once said loans of N1trn had been secured against it; the FG keeps saying crude oil has fallen to an all time low & the benchmark of $60/b is less than the real-time market price..I mean help me
7799 2018-12-20 12:31:10 You people are fools and you care more about your ideology and ridiculous support for your conscience than you do for your fellow citizens. How is abandoning the land we fought to secure good for America. How is giving Russia the majority of Syrian oil good for America?
7800 2018-12-20 12:30:56 No one sees any reason to have the pesky Kurds demanding human rights, multiculturalism, peace and liberation in a region now heavily invested in bloodshed, oil, war and terrorism. Iran, Turkey, Assad and Russia have hated the Kurdish element in this entire thing.
7801 2018-12-20 12:30:54 Do you understand that Venezuela is as oil rich as Canada? They're broke because of corruption and because they can't get their product to market. Canada is ABSOLUTELY in danger of falling into a communist controlled state and the threat is from Trudeau himself. Wake up.

Let Russia have it. Let them use their resources.

No one is going to tame that region.

We dont need their oil. It is no longer strategic for us 

If Europe wants to protect thier interests have at it.

7811 2018-12-20 12:28:53 Crap if we hit an oil gut at 2023 due to EVs. Where are the lost $$$ from gas tax to be made up. Did we need infrastructure tax on electricity use for transportation?
7812 2018-12-20 12:28:45 Stop disturbing yourself, in a few years, the demand for crude oil  will reduce and owning oil blocks would not be so attractive.
7813 2018-12-20 12:28:38 おなしゃす！

7816 2018-12-20 12:28:37 Then there's the fishing bollocks, the entire Oil & Gas shennanigans, renewables funding losses, reneging on shipyard promises, the £1bn carbon capture investment at Peterhead, the blatant power grab, the open contempt in Westminster.
It's as if Scots aren't welcome in the UK...
7817 2018-12-20 12:28:36 A managed 'no deal' is an oxymoron. Only those with wildly unrealistic views about the UK's relationship to the EU27, post #Brexit, could possibly believe the unconvincing, evidence-free snake oil of Andrea Leadsom.
7818 2018-12-20 12:28:28 Billions? We only have one refinery here now. And it can handle Venezuelan oil, which is dirty. Where did that number come from?
7819 2018-12-20 12:28:24 おっけ～じゃ明日持ってくで 昼休みくらいかな
7820 2018-12-20 12:28:21 Bill.

You never got back to me about your claim that 100% of oil revenues (£600million) is better than Barnett/City Deals (£21.1billion+).
7821 2018-12-20 12:27:59 Yemen wanted a pipeline to Europe, they asked Assad if they can go through Syria, he said no. So the war in syria was started to remove Assad. That pipeline would put the Mideast in direct competition with Russia so putin backed Assad. War benifits Gini oil & haliburton not us.
7822 2018-12-20 12:27:53 My wife use coconut oil for everything,.....I mean everything.
7823 2018-12-20 12:27:52 Sure they need to get their troops out.Stop meddling in Arab affairs, pushing them around to control oil prices. Appointing governments that ensure nothing but positive outcomes to the US then maybe their own citizens. Why don’t u start with B McGurk?
Who invented creative chaos?
7824 2018-12-20 12:27:27 Nothing Can Be Made WITHOUt oil.
7825 2018-12-20 12:27:26 Isn't that what America does? Fighting on foreign soil, over oil, gas and geopolitical interests, installing democracy in the process? 
So what's going on with your rep potus?
7826 2018-12-20 12:27:23 If you don’t get in to get an oil change early you’ll never get one

7829 2018-12-20 12:27:01 If you  had sense shame, you would not lie that USA is getting nothing for protecting people in the middle east. As USA you do everything for oil, not because you love them... Your hands are stained with innocent people in the Middle East..
7830 2018-12-20 12:27:01 Oil is not an ethical product. It's damaging our planet's future. Oil means money to the conservatives. Money equals votes. That's all it is...  We have to begin leaving oil in the ground now and ensure your children have a life.

7844 2018-12-20 12:25:28 HEY!  I thought you said we killed ISIS!  Why would Russia and Syria and Iran be unhappy about fighting someone that you're saying we already killed.  WHAT is really going on here Donald?  Did Putin say he wanted you off his Syrian oil fields?

7848 2018-12-20 12:24:52 Hot oil did that to my face
7849 2018-12-20 12:24:48 Yeah, that’ll pass in the Big Oil Owned @senateGOP.

PS You will never be governor of AZ.
7850 2018-12-20 12:24:45 When i saw #OpenOilLicense i went to google about our oil industry and seriously, there are things we must change. I think it should start with the Oil Licensing Process truly.
7851 2018-12-20 12:24:38 The wall is not happening.  It was never going to happen.  Too many obstacles like cost, private land & areas you can’t build the wall due to terrain.  But it sure made a great rallying point by POTUS during rallies that got you guys fired up.  You fell for his snake oil!
7852 2018-12-20 12:24:34 Kalo punya budget laneige, estee lauder, missha... Kalo lokal serum wardah maybe? Atau the ordinary rosehip oil gitu kan bagus
7853 2018-12-20 12:24:30 Water resources and oil resources will always be used as bargaining chip for financial or political gains. Legitimate demands/grievances will always be easy to hijack. Additionally, there has been systematic targeting of the GMMR infrastructure for a while now. #Libya
7854 2018-12-20 12:24:28 But you have to admit you were there for two reasons: 1) serving Israel 2) the oil.
7855 2018-12-20 12:24:27 Go ahead. You first. Knock yourself out. I’m going to keep enjoying glut of oil we find ourselves with.
7856 2018-12-20 12:24:23 But solar powered cars will become commonplace hopefully by the 2050s so oil can't be as useful
7857 2018-12-20 12:24:22 Wouldn't it be awesome to boil them in their own oil, or is that just me?
7858 2018-12-20 12:23:57 หลงรัก face oil คือใช้มาประมาณสี่ยี่ห้อ มันดีทุกยี่ห้อเลยอะ แง
7859 2018-12-20 12:23:55 So you are running an add putting brewery or molsons employees against oil patch workers? There are hundreds (maybe more) that work for Molsons in Alberta. Also, although the HQ is based in QUE, the city company has many breweries throughout Canada. Horrible strategy.

7867 2018-12-20 12:23:13 Trump followers believe in; the Easter Bunny, Great Pumpkin; Mexico will build the wall and trump won the Syrian shitshow; caused by climate change. Oh, yea, let's not forget W-Dick war in Iraq. Over lies. Or was it oil? Liberation? Whatever it was, isis liked it.
7868 2018-12-20 12:23:10 Your country never respect kurdish martyrs because kurdish peshmergah defend you and all humanity around the world. As normal kurdish people knew that you are the business man, the only important  thing for is oil and sale you weapons,you dagger on kurdish back again like in 1975
7869 2018-12-20 12:23:02 Sorry trump..you cannot 
  Win the hearts and minds. America had no right invading Iraq or Afghanistan.. You invaded these countries on a lie   .  for its oil and minerals.. Don't bullshit
7870 2018-12-20 12:22:46 No, lets become 100% energy independent, build the Solar Grid, combined with the massive amounts of oil, coal and natural gas that we have, there  is no need to go overseas to fight, lets build the Great American future!
7871 2018-12-20 12:22:45 Marunong ka mag oil painting????
7872 2018-12-20 12:22:44 Stopping the selling only hurts the manufacturer not the buyer. If you want to make a difference then cut off the oil, their only source of revenue. 2000 people losing their job in a Canadian factory is not going to make SA change anything.
7873 2018-12-20 12:22:43 Probably my fav movie of all time is Laurence of Arabia (beginning to end just about perfect an arch one can...)

7886 2018-12-20 12:21:35 US bears a huge responsibility but Trump is a puppet of Big OIL and instead of acting on climate is acting for the fossil fuel industry increasing emissions from coal to car emissions and drilling expansion from Arctic to Utah

7888 2018-12-20 12:21:14 By shutting down the oil industry it keeps the Canadian peso rather low, thus discouraging us from traveling so we stay home and they hope they are able to fill our heads with Canadian content from the media they just paid off.
7889 2018-12-20 12:21:11 @pid_gov @ImranKhanPTI @Asad_Umar 2much over confidence is also no good.oil prices came down.pak getting oil on credit too.

7893 2018-12-20 12:20:47 The United States and Russia are responsible for the majority of trouble in the Middle East for decades due to your country’s insatiable greed for oil and control. If you pull your soldiers out why not pull out of interfering in other areas of the Middle East as well

7896 2018-12-20 12:20:28 IMF is not projecting any issuance until $1bn in 2022 and $2.5bn in 2023. But I agree with you, especially given where the oil price is now and external debt amortisation needs in 2019.
7897 2018-12-20 12:20:24 Decades old alliance, security cooperation, business ties mainly Saudi oil, Iran...the list goes on and on
7898 2018-12-20 12:20:21 If US want to maintain Bretton Woods alliance they have to make sure that oil flow via Persian gulf (part of the Middle east)is secured otherwise the alliance is as good as dead.

7902 2018-12-20 12:19:18 So I’m guessing, Russia wants to take the Middle East oil, and by pulling out, and lifting sanctions against Syria, the Russian masters can move that oil to market. But there is no collusion.

Yeah, pull out - that's not gonna affect the US, is it??

7916 2018-12-20 12:17:52 USA was always the Policeman especially in Middle East. Why?
Oil is the answer. Oil is always the answer.
In the long run this oil seems to be way more precious to US administrations than these lives you are talking about.

7953 2018-12-20 12:13:55 Confused about oil. Just doesn’t make sense. Once economic growth has happened, and people buy the ultimate consumer product- the car, they are stuck buying petrol for decades. Has supply really grown so much? Just perplexed at macro oil story.

8012 2018-12-20 12:09:05 So apparently the Syrians don't have any oil or other durable goods that you can get your hands on, so they are of no value 2you.Never mind they protected/ assisited our soldiers during this war to get their country back.Lord help Us if we need help n an invasion.$$$thru veins!

8035 2018-12-20 12:06:50 No, it’s the US currently occupying our oil fields. And this neo-liberal wants to keep it that way
8036 2018-12-20 12:06:46 Great interview with SS 
 The next 12-18 months are going to keep us very busy.

Oil flowing, tankers regularly out of the gates.

Money flowing in, cash flow shouldn't be a problem.

New sites to be drilled.

Production increasing regularly throughout the whole period.

8037 2018-12-20 12:06:31 It takes about 3 months for the oil tankers the investment counsel business to unload?
8038 2018-12-20 12:06:22 When did oil race towards $100/bbl?
8039 2018-12-20 12:06:18 There's oil.
8040 2018-12-20 12:06:17 He left for the oil money wages
8041 2018-12-20 12:06:15 Ask them then if they want WCS oil or Bitumen... In the water One floats and can be cleaned up... Bitumen sinks and Contaminates and kills fish and wild life for years
8042 2018-12-20 12:06:12 So this morning I had boiling hot oil spat into my eye while cooking breakfast, and then kieran knocked a full cup of coffee over
8043 2018-12-20 12:06:11 Question is will Iran overrun Syria and change the landscape. With control of oil they can fund their holy war against Christianity. Second is this a negotiation tactic
8044 2018-12-20 12:06:10 I don't think Trump cares for Syria's oil. You might want to have a look at Erdogan. Russia released video of Turkey taking your oil in Syria.
8045 2018-12-20 12:05:50 Challenge accepted. Cool 

Im 24, i grew up poor, bought myself a Ferrari when i was 16, i drove it to boarding school everyday. I own 3 oil companies in the UAE, and a 5star Hotel in France. I'm having dinner with Pres. Trump and family tonight at my apartment in Bulawayo
8046 2018-12-20 12:05:47 I didn’t know people use grape seed oil to cook tbh. I’m not inspired to re-up on vitamin e though.
8047 2018-12-20 12:05:43 Forte Oil ni...

8049 2018-12-20 12:05:36 Mr. President, very pertinent point. No sensible nation should stay for long in the Middle East. I am not a U.S. national nor I am from the Middle East. But one question- did the US go there to help the Middle East countries and its people or did you go there for the Oil?
8050 2018-12-20 12:05:36 There’s this perfume oil someone dashed me !  

It’s over for the girls on my street
8051 2018-12-20 12:05:29 Yes USA want to be the policeman of the middle East for their own benifits because your forces provide oil and and gems and golds etc which you forget. This is joke of the day. But its be your pleasure to with draw your all toops from Middle East. We know how to solve our problem
8052 2018-12-20 12:05:22 BoE:

- 0.75% (unch) as expected
- 9-0 vote as expected
- Warn that Brexit uncertainty has intensified since Nov
- As such, have lowered Q4 2018 growth estimate to 0.2% from 0.3%
- CPI could fall below 2% amid oil declines
- Maintain guidance on rates; 'gradual and limited'

8055 2018-12-20 12:04:44 Good Morning
Katherine.
PA  is always behind the times.
I personally use CBD oil for PTSD. It works better than any man made drug out there.
8056 2018-12-20 12:04:37 "Getting nothing?" You get to convince Congress to spend trillions of dollars on arms manufacturing, you get the bragging rights of being global policemen and finally, you get to control the main oil regions of the world!! Please redefine "getting nothing"!
8057 2018-12-20 12:04:36 Bank of England leaves rates on hold at 0.75%. 
Brexit uncertainty has "intensified considerably" over the last month and falling oil prices may soon push inflation below 2% target, it says.
8058 2018-12-20 12:04:34 US oil is self-sufficiency, the middle east is not important to U.S anymore now
8059 2018-12-20 12:04:23 Dinner idea: chicken breast seasoned w black pepper, garlic salt, &amp; bread crumbs. Squash &amp; broccoli, light olive oil. Bake 415 ~35min.

8061 2018-12-20 12:04:12 Yep Blair supported his fools economy going in with the US to protect Oil pipelines and supplies .. it could happen again
8062 2018-12-20 12:04:03 @LaurenB_WMTW Left you a DM in case you have story on oil prices during this winter that is coming up.
8063 2018-12-20 12:03:59 oil at $55 and USD below 70.
8064 2018-12-20 12:03:50 Thank goodness you’re bringing the troops out of Afghanistan. They don’t need to be protecting oil pipelines any longer!
8065 2018-12-20 12:03:49 #いただきまな
8066 2018-12-20 12:03:46 Well Nova Scotia already went through the coal and it's disasters. And Alberta doesnt want to pay carbon tax know I understand why.  They want to live for fossil fuels . Coal and oil are dying out ask U.S  economy.
8067 2018-12-20 12:03:46 Stop buying their oil and they will end the arms deal.... @justintrudeau
8068 2018-12-20 12:03:38 @POTUS hey boss man hope everything's going well in the white house this morning I played the lotto and didn't win I just want to be oil change and tires on time Rich
8069 2018-12-20 12:03:37 i start to wonder what stance does some muslim have towards halal food, to actually probe into something that’s apparently halal. ex: you check vege oil if it has non-halal ingredient, well they can’t name it vege oil if it contains other than that. ain’t that obvious enough?
8070 2018-12-20 12:03:31 Are they already breaking it by cutting sale of solar power to the grid and supporting fracking and oil exploration?
8071 2018-12-20 12:03:30 CPI LIKELY TO FALL BELOW 2 PCT IN COMING MONTHS AFTER OIL PRICE FALL, COULD SUPPORT DEMAND

CPI LIKELY TO DROP TO AROUND 1.75 PCT IN JAN 2019

BOE SAYS Q1 2019 GDP GROWTH LIKELY TO REMAIN AROUND 0.2 PCT QQ, BASED ON LIMITED INFORMATION AVAILABLE
8072 2018-12-20 12:03:29 Ghost companies lifted $3.1Billion worth of crude oil under APC Government in the past 10 months. -Daily Trust Newspaper
8073 2018-12-20 12:03:15 深煎りのブラジルが「首を吊られた人間の味」か…。何か元ネタがあるんだろうか。ひとまず軽く調べたけどまったく当たらない。今度うずに行ったときに聞いてみよう。そして変な爺さんにも会ってみたいな。
8074 2018-12-20 12:03:14 This reflects Trump admin priorities:
Cage Children, let Vets kill themselves, tax breaks for the rich, change laws to support the oil and all other polluting sectors, stealing all they can while it lasts... Etc etc. All Trump admin should end in jail.
8075 2018-12-20 12:03:06 How about charging them for our services. They have enough oil to pay for our services just like Russia is charging Assad 25% of Syrian oil for Russia military service. Our ally, SDF possess most of the Syrian oil and now we're giving it to Russia. How is this good for America?
8076 2018-12-20 12:02:44 Donald trump is giving Vladimir Putin his Christmas present, if USA pull out of Syria it will give the Russian backed regime control over the country, which will be Assad's chance to get his dictatorship in full throttle, and give Russia control over the billion dollar oil fields
8077 2018-12-20 12:02:41 Subject line of story pitch I will not be reading: “Choosing a Good CBD Oil for Your Dog.” 

I remember when it was a big deal to feed your dog cheese.
8078 2018-12-20 12:02:21 try coconut or argan oil (conditioner)
8079 2018-12-20 12:02:15 TIME FOR MILES AND MILES OF PALM OIL FARMS
8080 2018-12-20 12:02:10 Wrong. Who raises rates in a bear market, unwinding of balance sheet, slowing overseas (and US) economy, slumping oil market (stable inflation)? He could have paused now and raised if the aforementioned stabilized.
8081 2018-12-20 12:02:07 Makes me giddy inside that others see Chris as a snake oil salesman
8082 2018-12-20 12:02:05 And the Saudis are cutting production. They stated it again and again yesterday. Unbelievable, the US has the fifth fleet in Bahrain and is protecting their king and cronies for decades, and they decide to cut production to boost oil prices, because thats all they have. Sillies
8083 2018-12-20 12:01:55 @LagosTalks913
It's kind of disheartening, all those products like coconut oil and Shea butter have been tossed to the side.
So what can people use that is the bare minimum on their skin?
I use only baby oil, now this is making me doubt using it.
8084 2018-12-20 12:01:55 He wants Syria to be placed under Israeli Occupation, so that Israel can get access to the Syrian oil fields. This has been a Genie Energy war. Syria does not have a Rothschilds Bank. These neocons have no beef with ISIS. They have been arming them from the start.

8088 2018-12-20 12:01:20 Well, if you want to keep getting all that lovely oil..........
8089 2018-12-20 12:01:17 You are a theiving, war criminal on steroids. We don’t want you in syria, you are stealing our oil, is this your liberalism?
8090 2018-12-20 12:01:16 Today: Car stuff (safety, oil change, winter tires) and then AT Advisory Committee late this afternoon

8093 2018-12-20 12:01:00 y’all talking about traffic complainers and being angry about that but? wasting everyone’s time in the name of alberta oil is a first world complaint.
8094 2018-12-20 12:00:54 You can go to the market ma. At least Garri that was N600 is now N250. Oil is N1800 from N400 so really what is the problem

8096 2018-12-20 12:00:48 The oil industry is messed up.
8097 2018-12-20 12:00:44 We all do and we all should be judged by  them if we are leading others because those mistakes impact more than us. In this case this is beyond stupid, this is treasonous.

8100 2018-12-20 12:00:29 When oil is racing towards $100/bbl, no mention of option gamma, no mention of oh this is just market sentiment (its should gravitate to fundamentals). Oh, and no mention of algos or machines or.. unbelievable how biased the oil market narrative is always... #OOTT
8101 2018-12-20 12:00:15 No...you want their oil....
8102 2018-12-20 12:00:10 Get out of the Middle East. We dont need their oil and they have nothing else  to offer us.
8103 2018-12-20 12:00:05 Oil was discovered by mistake while looking for water... #KnowTheDifference

8105 2018-12-20 12:00:01 If you notice your vehicle has a higher than usual oil consumption it can be due to any number of issues including excessive flow resistance in the exhaust system or a clogged oil drain pipe. More details below
#aet #turbotips #turbofaults
8106 2018-12-20 11:59:57 And they wonder why they are thought of by the rest of us as rubes.  Snake oil salesman enchants villagers
8107 2018-12-20 11:59:52 K reg Morris marina. Unknown number of owners, serviced a few times, starts sometimes, reasonably frugal oil consumption, death trap tbh but have added alloys and leather steering wheel cover. Grab yourself a bargain.
8108 2018-12-20 11:59:46 What? 2 time ATH on stocks, crude oil best year from 2015 and only 2 months bear market you call best year since something...? Please...
8109 2018-12-20 11:59:28 I don't think it is right that the Minister of Petroleum should be the sole person giving out oil blocks. This is not credible and we have seen it played out in the Malabu Scandal. I support an #OpenOilLicense
8110 2018-12-20 11:59:05 $20 oil coming to a pump near you
8111 2018-12-20 11:58:58 I would even go back further and tell you about Ronald Reagan Ronald Reagan were friends with Saddam Hussein Saddam Hussein never tried to hurt America longest key was in power the gas in the oil prices was livable $21 a barrel think about that for a minute

8113 2018-12-20 11:58:49 And you are buying these earrings at Claire's Accessories, yes? Or are you going to do the oil drum to suit?
8114 2018-12-20 11:58:45 True. The whole Saudi thing was supposed to be a soft appeal to patriotism but you can't shame the shameless. 

They do not want us to export our oil. Fine, but that's a deal breaker. #Separation #Consequences
8115 2018-12-20 11:58:43 Do i have permission to put oil stains on it if I buy it?
8116 2018-12-20 11:58:22 そうそう！なんかギャルゲーかと思ったら違ったやつ！
8117 2018-12-20 11:58:16 Great. Stop meddling. Wouldn't be there in the first place if the commodity was dates, rather than oil.
8118 2018-12-20 11:58:09 Fuels made from crude oil and natural gas are not self renewing as they're made​ from prehistoric dead matter and will run out. Solar and wind energy are far more sustainable as they're constantly there and will only run out of our planet ceases to be

8124 2018-12-20 11:56:27 No the usual, hud an oil change doon the brasshoose last night
8125 2018-12-20 11:56:23 The oil patch isn't subsidized? 

An independent analysis says Canadian governments are subsidizing the oil patch to the tune of about $2.8 billion a year, despite a G20 agreement to pare back such support.
8126 2018-12-20 11:56:08 This is no war idiot The fighting is nearly  over and now we're handing the land we fought and some died for to Russia. You think this is in America's interest? Did you know most of the Syrian oil is with our allies now but Russia will take it when we leave. How is this good?
8127 2018-12-20 11:56:04 There is no cash cow, and Trudeau has nothing to with the price of oil.
8128 2018-12-20 11:56:03 Key Observation Today - Inflation/Credit: Brent crude oil (CO1) broke below the 200-week SMA intraday. Last downside break? July 2014, the start of the bear market.

200-day SMA = short-term trend change
55-week SMA = intermediate-term trend change
200-week SMA = cycle change

8130 2018-12-20 11:56:01 Indeed. We shouldn't be drilling anywhere new.
These sorts of moves are very ominous, not only because of local impact but because of what it says about Big Oil. They expect to fight back against sane energy and climate policies, and win, for a very long time to come.

8134 2018-12-20 11:55:17 @briannelson59 @BobMadden1 @Rock1029 crude oil price dropped in the past week, too.  But went back up yesterday, so don’t be surprised if gas prices do, too.
8135 2018-12-20 11:55:12 He'll check your oil 
8136 2018-12-20 11:55:10 Lain, does it not occur to you that all the American oil or predominantly American owned companies who make more money getting our oil cheap might have something to do with the problem? Ya know, follow the money and all?
8137 2018-12-20 11:55:09 Ha habido tendencia en USA hacia el shale oil (fracking) q no es el tipo de materia prima + adecuada para la obtención de diesel,existe tb una tendencia de cambiar columnas de cracking en Eu para más adecuadas al fracking. Pero no es correcto decir que el diesel se acaba
8138 2018-12-20 11:55:07 Which means more rocket sales, more oil, more $$ defense contracts. You can’t WIN the war or you have no war spending.
8139 2018-12-20 11:55:04 I want to try using oil paints
8140 2018-12-20 11:55:01 If there is economic chaos as suggested, there will be less economic activity and less demand, as well as major Russian customer of oil china being affected by less demand in Europe.
8141 2018-12-20 11:54:59 Talking of oxygen have you seen what this shower are doing about the IPCC report. The opposite of what’s needed, cutting solar subsidies and aiding big oil and fracking. Stupid clowns should be in jail.
8142 2018-12-20 11:54:59 The weakest link in Nigeria’s oil and gas value realisation is the oil licensing process and this has been demonstrated with the allocated oil blocks that are dormant. 
#OpenOilLicense
8143 2018-12-20 11:54:58 Incorrect - #oil closed at 47.20 (Jan contract) yesterday. Today the contract rolled to Feb 2019 had a higher price so the % change for the day you're seeing is inaccurate

8151 2018-12-20 11:53:29 Yup, one of many that know tar sand oil is doomed. Dirtiest and most costly oil on earth. You really need to sniff a lot of it not to see this.
8152 2018-12-20 11:53:03 By the way as a side note about our prime minister Legault’s dirty oil. A poll taken here in Quebec said 66% of the people would rather have Canadian oil than imported. We know have 45% of Quebec’s oil coming from Alberta. Politician assholes from whatever party

8160 2018-12-20 11:51:53 I picked up a virus which resulted in laryngitis so I nipped in the bud by overdosing on red capsicums cooked in the microwave (25mins) then after soaking in cold water (10 mins) peeled and made into a salad with salt, apple cider vinegar, and oil. Yumm

8164 2018-12-20 11:50:54 At selling out Americans. Americans have died to secure Eastern Syria and now we're giving it to Russia knowing this is where all the oil in Syria is. How does this make sense to you?
8165 2018-12-20 11:50:48 You folks are so predictable. 

If Trump keeps troops there, you'll say, he's doing it for the oil so we can take over. 

He takes troops out and it's for Russia. ---- why is Trump arming Ukraine if he is in bed with Russia?

He can't win. Stop being blinded by your party.

8167 2018-12-20 11:50:45 @LaurenB_WMTW @CristinaWMTW It hurts that the home heating prices remains 2.80 per gallon. 
Crude oil is trading at $46.65 per barrel. 
It has been on a downward trend for the past few months.
One should get relief from the heating prices in theory.
8168 2018-12-20 11:50:32 If our aim is to get the best out of our oil & Gas undustry, Nigeria cannot afford to ignore the standard global practice of #OpenOilLicense.

Our political leadership must rethink its reluctance in signing the #PIGB.
8169 2018-12-20 11:50:30 Abi ooo...thats even those with big nig investment in oil will let it succeed
8170 2018-12-20 11:50:19 18. We need to keep serving our oil masters for the sake of the dollar, war profiteers for the sake of the bankers and Israel for the sake of our ruling class maintaining their power. 

The ruse is transparent now.

8175 2018-12-20 11:49:34 Do you realize most of the fighting is over. We have secured Nearly all of Syria East of Euphrates where the vast majority of the oil is? Russia wants this area for the oil and when we leave they will take it. How is this in America's interest. Instead, strike a deal with SDF

8179 2018-12-20 11:48:41 Less taxes = lower cost = increase increase in demand = increase in supply; the truth is big oil lobbyists will never allow this.

8189 2018-12-20 11:46:58 I don't think it is right that the Minister of Petroleum should be the sole person giving out oil blocks. This is not credible and we have seen it played out in the Malabu Scandal. I support an #OpenOilLicense
8190 2018-12-20 11:46:51 Nigeria will import, just like they are doing today - having the oil makes not difference to incompetent folks...

8199 2018-12-20 11:45:58 The weakest link in Nigeria’s oil and gas value realisation is the oil licensing process and this has been demonstrated with the allocated oil blocks that are dormant.

8204 2018-12-20 11:45:10 You’ll be getting all the credit when Putin takes over Syria and gets all their oil. Is Putin promising you a part of the oil profits? Remember, Putin is as big a liar as you. When he no longer needs you he will simply not keep his word. Remember how he stole the Super Bowl ring?

8227 2018-12-20 11:41:07 Seems like at some point the decision was made to turn Dubai into a vile western-facing hyperluxury consumer destination to provide long term revenue when the oil runs out

8230 2018-12-20 11:40:59 They already get the majority of their oil from Western Canada, followed by imports from US. So what's your point?

8234 2018-12-20 11:40:28 Actually, this factually incorrect. The IRVING refinery (just like the Montreal refinery) are designed to process light sweet oil. They have no choice but to import light sweet oil. If energy east was approved, they would have happily invested the B$ to convert to heavy cad oil.

8244 2018-12-20 11:39:45 I don’t think that would be good. When oil prices fall, a decline in currency cushions the shock. Oil producers face expenses in local currency, so this allows them to essentially hedge against commodity price movements.

8317 2018-12-20 11:27:57 "No, you're doing it wrong! I'll only tell you this once... 'First you get the oil ...'"

8329 2018-12-20 11:24:57 Looks like oil will be heading to $30 soon enough. Daily mid-single digit drops seem to be the norm now. Powell was the nail in the coffin. Physical market doesn’t matter in the short term, it’s all sentiment driven. #oott

8332 2018-12-20 11:24:51 No, you can’t just process dilbit in a refinery. It needs to be upgraded first, then to a refinery that’s geared toward heavy oil. Iriving refineries in the east are geared to lighter crudes. Energy East was only intended as an export pipeline, heading straight to port.

8337 2018-12-20 11:24:26 Oligarch playing along, conceding to something at the precise moment they hike interest rates.  What else did they get from Syria? Oil? Replace a talking head w/ one of their own? I don’t know because I have gotten so bored w/ their tactics in the news a long time ago.
8338 2018-12-20 11:23:52 Yes they’ve been sold snake oil
8339 2018-12-20 11:23:49 Our 2019 budget is based on $60 per barrel while the current oil price is $55.

Basically we're entering the new year with a budget deficit. Meaning we'll have to borrow more money in 2019 to finance the budget.
8340 2018-12-20 11:23:44 As if the American presence caused any stability anywhere they go!!! Their presence destroyed  Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria so far!  They only go to protect the kings of Arabia  for oil.

8356 2018-12-20 11:21:42 You shouldn't ever have been in Syria in the first place. Allying with KSA and jihadists to destroy a prospering secular country all for gas and oil.
8357 2018-12-20 11:21:35 Yup.

Going out to the shed to sharpen and oil Mme La Guillotine ...
8358 2018-12-20 11:21:14 .True. But now, that oil is not a problem for US, would love to see all our troops out of literally all military foreign locations abroad. Collect our equipment (Don't give to UN/ NATO) & trade with EVERY nation as our REPUBLIC founders intended before the Bankers/FED stole it.
8359 2018-12-20 11:20:43 Oil? What kind of Oil? Cooking Oil?
8360 2018-12-20 11:20:41 fuel include the oil price, exchange rates, refiner’s margins, site volumes and product supply and demand. Additionally, fuel prices can and do fluctuate and there are times when you may see variances. We would like to assure you that we’ve shared your 2/3

Aliyev's money and oil has blinded them and they are all suffer from spiritual and moral starvation.They worship money and they have done away with all the good works by those mentioned.
8394 2018-12-20 11:14:53 Nigeria is country, which is blessed abundantly with crude oil, but so far had spent N2.6 trillion on fuel import in 'just' 9-months and still spending billions on subsidy!

How can we even start to fix this country?

God knows that this is NOT what Buhari promised us.

8448 2018-12-20 11:08:15 I'd never used one before - I have a thing you put a candle under, but that doesn't give you the moist air. So they are good and you can use any oil - eucalyptus is great for chesty coughs but there are others that are soothing or just nice. xx

8450 2018-12-20 11:08:07 Coach Riley is LEGIT sir. Not one of those phony snake oil salesman like a lot of em are. But he’s not a bore and very relatable to guys too. I like your son’s game. Highly skilled...but physical too.
8451 2018-12-20 11:08:04 Thank you Art. Can I ask how do you calculate the 5yr avg? At Dec 14 total crude oil + petroleum products is 1.878.725kb and 5yr avg (average of weekly data of last 5 years) is 1.912.329kb, resulting in 33.604kb below 5yr avg. Thank you for your awesome work.
8452 2018-12-20 11:07:54 I like to keep mine simple and I don’t really care for onions so it’s just a lot of Garlic, tomato’s, tomato paste, olive oil and basil.

8460 2018-12-20 11:06:05 Wouldn’t worry about it. It’s probably popping to Walmart for new engine oil, oil filter and fuel filter. Must be due a service.

8466 2018-12-20 11:05:02 Oil prices are already sliding downwards as at today it is about $56 per barrel. Nigerian Government is estimating to generate about N 3.73 trillion from oil revenue to fund the 2019 budget. Why haven't we been able to look beyond oil and diversify our economy.  #TraderMoni

8488 2018-12-20 11:02:15 What about all the conflicts you are contantly causing on middle east? Just for oil
8489 2018-12-20 11:02:11 I can honestly tell you that I am not for any war. I am only concerned about Trump telling our Military what to do without a plan. When we leave, plan and put protections in place. We have a Military Base in the Middle East. Let us protect the people and forget about the oil.
8490 2018-12-20 11:02:07 Yes because @realDonaldTrump  never really believed Mexico would pay, it was just snake oil for his followers.  But they believed him and he can’t deliver.  So he’s making crap up again and this time they are not buying it. Too bad.  So sad.

8493 2018-12-20 11:01:47 Powell did not look at the price of oil; or bond yields.
8494 2018-12-20 11:01:46 Yes, but the 1970s was also an era of recession, the post-war long boom was ending, oil crisis, global neoliberalisation/financialsation had begun, manufacturing declining > all matters entirely extraneous to the EEC

8533 2018-12-20 10:56:18 Oil is inherently a selfish resource.  I doubt a gesture beyond their own issues was even thought about. For a 1/4 of the price a huge relatable story could have been created. The selfish parade.
8534 2018-12-20 10:56:16 Blame that on the overblown salaries & throw-away attitude of the oil industry that the UK left free to do what it wanted. Their inability to see the future has nothing to do with the SNP.

8584 2018-12-20 10:46:35 cleansing oil is better i guess. sebab dia removes dirt and heavy makeup. guna salah satu la kot  kalau you jenis tak makeup, maybe just pakai micellar water? depends on skin
8585 2018-12-20 10:46:32 Ha ha! That’s pretty funny. The oil and gas industry is in anything but good shape. Shows how much people outside of Aberdeen know

Or maybe the UK’s mismanagement of the oil industry?

8605 2018-12-20 10:44:16 I hate to say it but 1.5. Did you heat the oil in the pan enough before putting in the batter? Or did you have too much liquid in the batter?

8610 2018-12-20 10:43:39 I'm sure he is quoted as saying that "Scotland would have a financial surplus to an embarrassing degree"

What makes this so important is that in 1974 we had genuinely only found around 30 years worth of oil. Now we have discovered around 140 years and still discovering.

8619 2018-12-20 10:42:55 Hi Beachy! Island birders are generally in favour. We're doing an awful lot for wildlife oil the island - and this is an exciting additional project, drawing additional resources in, and already we're seeing landowners talking about habitat improvements on the back of this plan.

8714 2018-12-20 10:27:25 But also - with a global growth scare, weaker domestic growth, and plunging equity and oil prices there does seem to be a question on why now. Both Fed and Riksbank could easily have punted till March. Slowing the pace of hikes by 3months is not a big adjustment.

8717 2018-12-20 10:27:19 Difficult to advise poropriately without knowing the case, but try adding additional fat to foods (tspn olive oil oil stirred through pasta is extra 50kcals), I think you said coconut is an issue, but if not tolerating milk, can she tolerate oat based products?

8719 2018-12-20 10:27:02 @PMOIndia Please secure our future generation and emphasize impending danger to our children by banning the import of palm oil 

Please take this seriously.
8720 2018-12-20 10:26:58 Finance ministry can apply formula for fuel prices as a tool to align with  fluctuations of crude oil price and exchange rate ,but have to reduce  taxes when it unbearable to consumers.

8725 2018-12-20 10:25:46 Well, Russia is attacking our Government with Cyber Attacks, Turkey is blackmailing Trump, Saudi Prince is murdering American workers and Flynn is still betraying his Country. We don't want oil, we want peace. Peace for all people in the Earth. We rise and we fall together.

8727 2018-12-20 10:25:32 I haven’t studied Swedish inflation dynamics but in the US the last time this happened (Feb 2016) it shaved 0.9% off headline and 0.4% off core over the next six months. If oil weakness is sustained shaving two tenths off your forecast is not going to cut it.

8731 2018-12-20 10:25:04 Stop saying things ordinary common sense can resolve.
There shldn't hav been subsidies when global oil prices dropped. Ordinarily, there was nothing to subsidize again.
However, the value of naira to a dollar fell and we import products with dollars, hence, subsidies should come.

8758 2018-12-20 10:21:43 Baghdad knows the Kurdish region is doing this hence why they reduced the budget from 17% to 12%, Iraq now controls the Kirkuk oil fields and there is still Iraqi troops in Sinjar or close to Sinjar I agree though the government should help the Yezidis more

8842 2018-12-20 10:08:04 I'd like to know how to do this also. For me its not a matter of going through all of them, its just a matter of looking at a few until I see something that has a decent surplus. I went for BPT yesterday as oil was down overnight, BPT is my first thought when I see oil move.
8843 2018-12-20 10:08:01 In 2016 they contributed to less than .05% of the global oil production. They are ranked 60th in the world for oil exports. You just quoted me hypothetical numbers of expectations before a civil war broke out. Did you even read that before copy and pasting?
8844 2018-12-20 10:07:42 Does storages mean shortages? In the last 20 years in Scotland roads were closed several times: snow, lorry drivers blockade and oil terminal blockade. Fresh food ran out in 2 days! Whether you like it or not this is a country that depends on trade.

8850 2018-12-20 10:06:59 They’re birds  of same feathers...they’ll never walk out..they’re enjoying the oil they’re licking from the back of the bottle..
8851 2018-12-20 10:06:27 But it earnings r not stable. Oil has gone as high as 80 dollars this year and I think a low as 50 dollars. Presently in mid 50s so what do u use as ur earnings?
8852 2018-12-20 10:06:19 Supposedly they don't move on oil prices either. But yea, not an obvious move. If their forecasts are off and there is a recession coming its of course wrong. We can reconvene and see in six months or so
8853 2018-12-20 10:06:08 Won't change the fact that you have changed oil numerous times, these millennials havent changed any oil, they still fresh like a bath.

8858 2018-12-20 10:05:19 I doubt this will do anything tangible to change the overall situation for oil production and pipeline awareness. Pure antics from oil patch workers and probably at best a way to vent. This energy (physical and actual) could be put to more productive use.
8859 2018-12-20 10:05:08 Because they want to make sure that the oil stays in our control.
8860 2018-12-20 10:04:32 Yung gusto kong magpicture sa site pero yung site oil and gas depot
8861 2018-12-20 10:04:26 ....has moved in next door and are getting a hand out from "our" governments using "our" taxes. We destroy everything, then steal the gas, oil, gold etc and accuse migrants/refugees of getting a free ride when in truth they have paid tenfold for the tiny bit we give begrudgingly.
8862 2018-12-20 10:04:19 why do i always lose my oil control papers 
8863 2018-12-20 10:04:17 My formula for success? Rise early, work late, strike oil.

8907 2018-12-20 09:57:51 Basically a threat from Putin. I guess the lower oil revenues must be playing havoc with the Russian budget ......

9010 2018-12-20 09:41:46 No. Ehlers Danlos Syndrome. Also, autoimmune disease (Hashimoto's Thyroiditis and something that looks and acts like Lupus), The CBD oil helped control the pain but did not impact the symptoms. It was changing to a #carnivorediet that really changed things for me. #meatheals

9014 2018-12-20 09:41:41 Brexit is utterly different to the fuel strikes & oh by the way our oil doesn’t come from the EU? If we were on a war footing, the whole of UK economy/industry would begin making weapons of war, this is classic project fear again.

9020 2018-12-20 09:40:35 @PurePetFood is the way forward. Totally natural, only contains pure protein, spinach, carrots, coconut oil and eggs. You rehydrate with water.

The price they set is because they know we have to sell it and they don’t need to buy ours. It would be different if they were needing our oil. Then we could charge more

9269 2018-12-20 09:05:17 I live with a truck driver that was in the oil patch till 2 years ago. Been trucking for 45 years. He never even heard about this convoy before today. We live an hour away from Nisku. I cannot find any article to say who exactly  #Truckers For Pipelines is. Anyone?

9275 2018-12-20 09:04:22 The key is to be selective with oil shares. The Saudis need the price of oil higher to meet their budgets so the price should move back up.

I'm happy to be in #AMER #ECHO as both expecting news & share price already hit hard so believe they present a good opportunity to invest.
9276 2018-12-20 09:04:17 At this point we need to ask our presidential candidates what is the plan for coping with another oil price collapse. No insults, no fighting corruption, no blocking leakage etc just 3-5 clear ideas of how to cope under $50/bbl oil?

After, turn the taps off on Trans Mountain so no oil to their Burnaby Refinery. BC gets to walk their high & mighty Eco talk, for REAL.

9477 2018-12-20 08:36:58 The UK Government pursuing shale gas & Clair RIdge oil production whilst being a signatory to Paris is a form of civil disobedience absent of integrity.

9541 2018-12-20 08:28:13 Ya I like using Neosporin when theyre cracked because its an antiseptic and helps heal cuts. Idk if its really meant for your lips but its worked for me when mine are cracked. I like mixing it with something more moisturizing tho, coconut oil is something I’m sure would work well

9550 2018-12-20 08:26:52 Al Jazeera conveniently omitted the fact that the US sponsored proxy terrorist group Boko Haram has directly contributed to the poverty equation in Nigeria. Shell has been abusing Nigeria's oil resources for decades without any consequences. Africa has been recolonized.

9597 2018-12-20 08:17:33 Nigeria is one of the highest exporters of crude oil, yet one of the poorest countries in the world. This is as a result of huge losses resulting from corrupt trade practices .  Economically , Nigeria is , ranked along  Venezuela, Cuba, North Korea and Zimbabwe which is an irony

America respects its interests so it along with European countries planted the Israeli intity as a guard in the Arab area mainly to guard oil and other economic interests . So Israel is the Western economic project established at the expense of the Palestinians.

9624 2018-12-20 08:13:34 Tammy, they do in fact refine it on site in the oil sands in Fort McMurray, but it’s a basic refining. The problem is during the boom times and still, most turned their nose up and wouldn’t work there so they have the upgrading done in more populated areas like Edmonton or Texas.

9773 2018-12-20 07:51:28 Use Oil less fryer like Charbroil. It uses propane. Skin is crispy like its fried. Meat is super juicy. Cooks in less than half the time of using oven. Best part drip pan under it catches fat for gravy and stuffing.
9774 2018-12-20 07:51:21 The 80% represents oil life not oil quantity. Also where on the dipstick does it show 5%. Most cars hold 4-6qts. Typically 20-30% oil capacity will not touch the dipstick. So if you have oil on the dipstick there is still 20-30% atleast in the engine.
9775 2018-12-20 07:51:06 Like good foreign policy, reduction of cumbersome restrictions on business, oil production/projects, jobs, and a good economy that president Trump has brought us.

9778 2018-12-20 07:50:32 The oil extraction business is by nature precarious work because it is finite, making it unsustainable. Even without climate change, the jobs would move around. Since at least since the 1980s, manufacturing jobs have been going away. Giving companies cash doesn't change that.
9779 2018-12-20 07:50:08 Yes as you say those that make money from existing fuels etc. are his biggest critics trying to fight and slow down clean fuels as much as they can.

 Rockefeller and standard oil fought to try to stop electric; he sold oil for lamps.
9780 2018-12-20 07:49:36 Canada should not be held ransom to oil. Nor should Canada stand in the way if Alberta chooses otherwise. If Alberta thinks it’s better off on its own, I’m ok with that. They can make the bet on oil without the rest of us.

9800 2018-12-20 07:46:50 Many countries which export oil has higher prices than India. India has avg petrol prices. 
It is not price only, we import 83% , consumption increases everyday with 20% automobiles growth. It will create higher & higher trade deficit leading more currency depriciatios.
9801 2018-12-20 07:46:31 There are no good strategy moves left for the US and the mandate for being there has altered. Besides ISIS/AQ, we have no admitted enemies other than the ones provided to us by other countries and their strategic interests in the region. We can sell our own oil now.
9802 2018-12-20 07:46:29 Well yes, that happens.  All the businesses that used to make buggy whips and buggy wheels went out of business too. That's what happens in a sunset industry. But even without Climate Change the oil business has always beejn boom or bust.  There are no guarantees.  #CDNpoli
9803 2018-12-20 07:46:19 ほーい
9804 2018-12-20 07:46:02 Don't mind these lazy Slay Queens of nowadays! Can you imagine, she actually went to buy Palm oil. Instead of her to enter Benin and press her palm kernel nuts and get the palm oil! These generation of girls are not like our Mothers, who were traditional submissive African women.
9805 2018-12-20 07:45:52 People build on gas/oil pipelines,  beneath high powered transmission lines,  gas stations are built indiscriminately in choked up residential areas. It's a mess!
9806 2018-12-20 07:45:46 Election should not be about tribe ..it should be about performance to public service
1. Ensuring peace n unity in Nigeria as a whole
2. Establish policies that will reduce poverty 
3. Reviving all dead refineries, Nigeria shud be able 2 refine their crude oil.. This is 21st cent
9807 2018-12-20 07:45:38 But we have to support them because without oil we wouldn't have all the things.
9808 2018-12-20 07:45:22 In 2014/3015 @MBuhari and @APCNigeria  said they were going to diversify the economy from depending on crude oil, how come all @MBuhari was saying yesterday is oil oil benchmark?

9815 2018-12-20 07:44:15 Oh she's got problems. Water & oil leaks. Can deal w/ that. She's ready for pasture in my opinion. Not going to keep spending good money on bad. Thanks so much for feedback GCB. I never try to treat profs as "free" advice.
9816 2018-12-20 07:43:58 Because Afghanistan has an incredible amount valuable resources. Not oil but valuable minerals.
9817 2018-12-20 07:43:48 The Bible & centuries old history tells us that playing big brother 2those in religious conflict in Middle East is stupid. We cannot change it. Why try to?

9846 2018-12-20 07:39:02 Ambanis don't dig for oil or climb lamp posts for mobiles or do aeronautical engineering for aeroplanes. They need not. They are entrepreneurs who 'establish' industries & business enterprises. Employ the required tech/non-tech experts to do the job.
9847 2018-12-20 07:38:40 You are all so shortsighted! What the hell has the UK done? Germany supports Putin directly with the gas pipeline and investments in oil and gas. US allies continuously victimize Trump, no one stood beside him on Israel and Saudi Arabia and condemns him on the wall so he withdraw
9848 2018-12-20 07:38:37 Most oil workers don’t have the money it takes to do that!

9851 2018-12-20 07:38:19 Why would Alberta produce more oil when we can't get it to market, and the only market is the discounted US market? 
And, why is this ALL Notley and Trudeau's fault? Those pipelines should have been in place years ago, but the govts were too short sighted to see we needed them.
9852 2018-12-20 07:38:12 If Trump is true to himself that donation will go straight in his pocket and he'll still not build the wall. Just look at the man's history. Everything he touches withers and dies, especially anything to do with money. He's a con' man, snake oil salesman.
9853 2018-12-20 07:37:40 May your cup overflow with oil and may your stores never run out of grain. Amen
9854 2018-12-20 07:37:36 the only reason america is “peace-keeping” in syria is because of oil that flows through the all-important pipeline
9855 2018-12-20 07:37:16 @NigeriaInfoPH 2019 budget is ill-fated, Revenue Estimates are wrong, oil Prices will never rise to $80 per Barrel 

Same old story for Nigeria

9859 2018-12-20 07:36:36 The below #NPPF claim can't be upheld based on newer scientific evidence.

“recognise the benefits of on-shore oil and gas development, including unconventional hydrocarbons, for the security of energy supplies and supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy;"
9860 2018-12-20 07:36:35 But there are many factors.
Firstly holiday season is starting and demand is high. And secondly it depends upon oil prices.
But still private airline is better than that.
9861 2018-12-20 07:36:16 and anyone who works in that industry should have been trying to prepare for the crash - too many didn't. 
I remember the bumper stickers after the Getty recession "Lord please give me another oil boom, and I won't piss it away this time."
People didn't learn.
9862 2018-12-20 07:36:16 Put some peppermint oil on your forehead. It has helped me go through tones and tones of migraines ! ;) it’s magical !!

They aren't hard done by. Those are the ones who should shut their mouths. There are LOTS who are in really tough spots, who really are losing their homes. 
BUT - and it is a big one - oil is cyclical. We all know that

9876 2018-12-20 07:33:53 boycotting palm oil doesn't really work since if somehow they decided to change to corn oil or sunflower oil, it will cause more land destruction than palm oil because palm oil have better yield/crop compared to the alternative.

what we need is sustainable palm oil.

9886 2018-12-20 07:31:21 It is Saudi money and SAR is running an unsustainable budget deficit with oil 50% below their budget assumption. Also the Softbank team is all ex DB staff. They only succeed in massively levered rising market conditions

Na just clap back and smart talk you dey find. My point is sharing it on social media is very important. But they should also try and do something
9896 2018-12-20 07:29:46 And our oil and gas folks don't!!?? Perhaps what we need is a Cdn energy cartel that sets supply quotas and price limits to all ECan users of WCan energy. 

 PET's NEP led to Lougheed's "minor" 15% shut off of Nat Gas going to Ont/Quebec... how about we shut off BC/Quebec... NOW!
9897 2018-12-20 07:29:38 AND. There comes a point where people have to realize that some of these jobs are NEVER coming back. NEVER. That is just the reality of the international market. So they better start looking forward, instead of just looking back. 
There is a reason why oil companies are

9912 2018-12-20 07:27:19 Every war the US has been in for the last 17 plus years have been to protect Mideast interests & mostly oil interests. When will America wean itself off oil? There are better ways out there. We don't need to be dependant on foreign oil or any oil for that matter.
9913 2018-12-20 07:27:12 Saskatchewan loves Alberta oil and all who show what a true Albertan is made of!

9917 2018-12-20 07:26:59 You do stupid good. What makes oil inefficient and how does it cripple our economy ?
9918 2018-12-20 07:26:46 When I used to tell people I worked for an oil company I occasionally realised they assumed the only jobs were at petrol stations - failing to understand that the product didn't come straight out of the sea and into the pumps.  Hilarious.
9919 2018-12-20 07:26:31 It is a modern day shame that crude is pumped out of Naija soil, exported and refined by multinational oil companies then re-imported and sold back into the country thru a bizarre and byzantine NNPC scheme.  
Loud talking restructuring mumus should start with this chaos.
9920 2018-12-20 07:26:29 Also, it depends on the lipbalm. I had heard the eos ones actually make your lips dry. use eyecream on your lips in the night and in the morning, or atleast put vaseline/coconut oil at night. it will help

9925 2018-12-20 07:25:35 He used predatory pricing to drive competitors from the field so he could raise rates for consumers. There was nothing "voluntary" about the prices people were paying.

9927 2018-12-20 07:25:32 Not really surprising if you know where to look at oil market correlations,  oil market has collapsed over the last month,  stabilized in the low $50's and then fell dramatically again this week.

European equities set to open sharply weaker with the FTSE and DAX both predicted to resume trading with a triple digit fall taking their cue from Wall Street.
9937 2018-12-20 07:24:22 Just depends on colleges and your skins elasticity but use collagen gel and vitamin E oil! It will help!
9938 2018-12-20 07:24:19 Just collected my Christmas rice & oil.

9940 2018-12-20 07:23:51 #p929 #ch114 @Project929 @929english This chapter is one of the weirdest in the Torah. Very short, it has two subjects: Oil for the menorah and the mekaleil. I have no idea why the two subjects are in the same chapter.

9947 2018-12-20 07:22:56 Finally! Nicola Tesla's ideas are coming out of the shadows! Let's use the free power sources and bury the coal and oil industry!

9949 2018-12-20 07:22:42 Your attempts at humor fail just like many other endeavors that you attempt. Your image is that of a snake oil salesmen.
9950 2018-12-20 07:22:41 extra ordinary oil
9951 2018-12-20 07:22:40 Nothing oh
9952 2018-12-20 07:22:37 We may never see the oil can again
9953 2018-12-20 07:22:36 And your neck is stiff in the 3rd picture in your pinned tweet. Have a nice day and get yourself some oil, WD-40 preferably, stiffy.
9954 2018-12-20 07:22:25 that meme. Bring oil!
9955 2018-12-20 07:22:22 $DAX - 1.49%

Amazing a stock from AUS, an Iron ore mining concern, and largest #OIL exporter in the world, $BHP can forecast a xetra German index, 7 hours later with Direction and TARGET correct..

There are over 8,000 stocks in the world, how do you find exactly this one?
9956 2018-12-20 07:22:07 Hmmm...I may look into your suggestion of a TENS machine/oil myself on 2019...you start to think about cannabis based medication but that is still after the fanfare about it being allowed has fizzled out.

9958 2018-12-20 07:21:51 His goal was always unrealistic, he's not Tony Stark. Sidenote using another nonrenewable resource in lithium isn't a viable replacement for oil either. A better solution would have been converting water treatment facilities to mop crop hemp and converting the hemp into ethanol.
9959 2018-12-20 07:21:51 Alaskans own 85,500 shares of FRANK'S INTERNATIONAL NV, worth $903,735. It's from the OIL SERVICES sector, based in NETHERLANDS.
9960 2018-12-20 07:21:45 Excellent news, now put the oil in.

9964 2018-12-20 07:21:28 Absolutely nothing to do with the price of oil. Fed up of hearing that nonsense.

9968 2018-12-20 07:20:54 This tweet was about actively trying to remove nail polish. 
I usually use gloves now with oil painting, also because I use Cad yellow (real) and Flake white as colors.

9970 2018-12-20 07:20:44 Woi followers, @fezajenn pakai oil cleanser muji harga mahal (aku tak tahu harga sebenarnya, tapi tahu mahal) #donetolongbrag
9971 2018-12-20 07:20:36 Fair enough. It’s just that I would not reduce the entire style to deep frying

Incidentally, the jury is open on whether shallow or deep frying is better in terms of oil absorption and olive oil over our native oils. Most confusing

9973 2018-12-20 07:20:25 Oh so you are the dummy that wants to make trains 5 times longer than they are right now, with zero increase in product movement, with a technology that hasn't been developed for lighter forms of oil. Even the tech for the bitumen style is still testing.
You just don’t get it.
9974 2018-12-20 07:20:25 sameee! naa na biya daw chicken oil
9975 2018-12-20 07:20:24 Genie Oil.
9976 2018-12-20 07:20:16 Yes let's waste a lot of gas with a slow highway convoy to make a statement about the struggling oil and gas sector! Nice.

9978 2018-12-20 07:19:53 Why is Q such a threat? What do you lose if people believe in Q?..... Business. That's the only logical reason to denounce him. He is free and those whom disagree with him or try to explain him (Corsi) are asking me for $$$. Snake oil salesman? I think not, Mr. Gorka.
9979 2018-12-20 07:19:52 tea tree oil helps

9981 2018-12-20 07:19:50 Finally i fit add oil and Co to mama's xmas rice.. I really need it bro
9982 2018-12-20 07:19:28 Lower oil will slow investment, while higher gas prices will raise costs for a whole range of US industries. This is beginning to look like the trigger for the US dollar to finally weaken......FINAL TRIGGER FOR THE GOLD UP MOVE?

9986 2018-12-20 07:19:04 Good oil pressure there. Mine sits around the 2nd mark and lower when hot
9987 2018-12-20 07:18:52 no negative vibes in the new year ok. everyone go out and get an essential oil diffuser and a himalayan salt lamp and let’s all just chill out
9988 2018-12-20 07:18:48 Well I'm sure Putin is happy.  Makes that whole oil pipeline thing so much easier for him.  You're certainly giving Putin an excellent return on investment.
9989 2018-12-20 07:18:42 Agree on both counts. But this is fried fish. Hence presumably deep fried. BTW, when I cook fish, I shallow fry (often in cooking grade olive oil) or don't fry at all
9990 2018-12-20 07:18:34 mix warm water & salt & put it on a cotton pad/ball and then put it on your nose !! also tea tree oil helps !! it helped me when my nose ring started to keloid

9997 2018-12-20 07:17:56 Bros!!! You are mouthed.. oil still dey your head... For me I see it like a course in our higher institution (strike 101, strike 112, strike 113) etc
9998 2018-12-20 07:17:46 Like this is more organized crime, a lot of fracking and oil, and less about nation states. It’s the neoliberal elite system being exposed, because dumbasses and greed made them go too far to ignore.
9999 2018-12-20 07:17:36 Mintz cites the anti-pipeline sentiment elsewhere in Canada as one of the root causes for Albrexit. However, he does not explain exactly how AB separating from Canada will improve Its ability to get its oil to tidewater. He thinks Canada will be more receptive if AB is a country?
10000 2018-12-20 07:17:31 Power and energy ministry. Good commissions on oil and coal purchases. Also big capital expenditures
10001 2018-12-20 07:17:25 DIY hot oil treatment for the day: vegetable oil (all I had), which I microwaved and then added conditioner and tea tree oil to. My hair is soooooo soft 
10002 2018-12-20 07:17:15 My axe oil spilled in my pants. Panaaaas je pocket... 
10003 2018-12-20 07:17:10 Its appalling to say the least. It's as if we are mortgaging the future of generations unborn today. And the deficit is huge considering that the oil forecast is higher than the current oil price.

10005 2018-12-20 07:16:54 Look at the prices of oil & gas in international markets & pls ask Asad Umer.... why
10006 2018-12-20 07:16:42 Most of these people can't organize their way out of a paper bag. Was over on "Yellow Vests Canada" on FB and the infighting is hilarious to see. Claims the group is all about the oil crisis, but they're being swamped by racists and nutbars wanting to hang PMJT for treason.
10007 2018-12-20 07:16:42 Aku juga abis beli padahal stok di rumah masi banyaaa wkwkwk yg oil lumayan nder dari 40k jadi 19k HAHA
10008 2018-12-20 07:16:31 I have said that to Greenpeace & Sea Shepard Aust, stop the oil campaign, where do they think diesel comes from.
Sea Shepard Aus is getting rid of the old tub they have and getting a new ship cost 12 million Aus, that's a lot of donations so the can go on a cruise tax free.
