1 2018-06-07 23:59:27 Also oil and gas companies.
2 2018-06-07 23:59:22 Beans and Oil:
Ok, so the fun 'correlation' for lack of a better term is done. $CL has held the important 64-63 range whilst Soybeans have dropped through both the 1k and 980, with 950 the last significant hurdle to sub 800. Eventually, we should see Oil down as Beans climb 2019!
3 2018-06-07 23:59:22 Discount Brand of Extra Virgin Olive Oil is Same as Other Brands, Swears its Hymen Just Broke a Few Years Ago During Gymnastics
4 2018-06-07 23:59:16 With hot oil
5 2018-06-07 23:59:02 The oil comes with a cost that some people are not willing to pay.
6 2018-06-07 23:58:47 Extra Virgin olive oil is amazing on my hair 
7 2018-06-07 23:58:23 I very much don't see how this is relevant to oil companies funding research and organizations to confuse and muddle public opinion on climate change. It does not deny effects or ExxonMobil's knowledge of them.
8 2018-06-07 23:58:16 Well,  America gets a heck of a deal on lumber (cheaper American homes) and oil (keeps your country & military functioning) and uranium (supplies your entire power grid) and many many other products.  I greatly appreciate my fellow North Americans but you are hurting allies. 
9 2018-06-07 23:58:07 Must be lackey for big oil
10 2018-06-07 23:58:05 Better the "add oil" light than the "low oil pressure" warning light. That one is trouble.
11 2018-06-07 23:57:59 Oil slick
12 2018-06-07 23:57:59 Got to have density, we have and are developing like pouring motor oil in a swimming pool. Won’t work!
13 2018-06-07 23:57:50 Something to consider: CBD oil (HEMP not marijuana). I've been looking into it for myself, amazed at some of the personal stories! So many applications. Possible cancer preventative/cure? Haven't tried it yet, my order is due tomorrow. It's now legal in all 50 states. Prayers! 
14 2018-06-07 23:56:24 I thought that was why they opened up coastal oil drilling
15 2018-06-07 23:56:14 Or slow down the flow of oil.

36 2018-06-07 23:55:46 Kale? Do you at least put olive oil and vinegar on it? And add strawberries? :)
37 2018-06-07 23:55:41 Hell ya. Just stfu and drain the oil 
38 2018-06-07 23:55:32 Instead of seasoning the meat they’re about to cook, the people in them Tasty videos put all the seasonings in the pot while they heat the oil and that shit rubs me wrong.
39 2018-06-07 23:55:27 ...umm...maybe...no...hmm...maybe he is a snake oil doctor? Yes. That sounds right but to be certain, I must consult my magic 8 ball... Okay, it says "All signs point to yes." so... Sigh, how does he have money and I'm a broke teacher? Come on!
40 2018-06-07 23:55:06 i'm trying this new coconut oil teeth whitening method and it's soooooo gross but effective.
41 2018-06-07 23:55:01 The rates must be subsidized so we must use oil revenue not new taxes to get the money. One thing is certain, people cannot take a 100% increase in their light bill!
42 2018-06-07 23:54:52 Ororo No Be Crude Oil
43 2018-06-07 23:54:47 I swear they put oil on the iPhones man, every time I pick it up I just end up dropping it.
44 2018-06-07 23:54:15 Snake oil salesmen
45 2018-06-07 23:54:05 "ExxonMobil is asserting the suit against the oil companies demonstrates bad faith because while the government entities are asserting global warming will result in costly damages to their jurisdictions they have not disclosed this fact in their bond offerings."

47 2018-06-07 23:53:33 And they were absolutely correct.  And now he is president and he confirms that he is a low life scumbag con man.  A seller of snake oil and, sadly, enough Americans are willing to buy the snake oil.
48 2018-06-07 23:53:32 Canada is the USAs largest & most secure supplier of energy, oil, natural gas & nuclear fuel.

Another time I thought it was my wisdom teeth but I had mumps But just get it checked out & hope exam goes ok x
51 2018-06-07 23:53:02 Weldon interest in Itera (link in article):
“Oil & gas traders & Russian experts have long suggested that Itera's real owners are former senior Gazprom executives and that the company was established in the US as a vehicle to transfer money out of Russia and into their pockets.”
52 2018-06-07 23:52:51 @stevemollenkopf They say the squeaky wheel get the oil... Screaming ~ I need your email ~ tremendous ideas here in this head ! “AI” right here in the “RI” -real !

56 2018-06-07 23:52:32 The combination of #TaxCuts used for buybacks (& not investments in productivity, wages), #TradeWars/#Tariffs (which will raise consumer prices), rising oil prices, growing health care costs will worsen distribution of wealth/opportunity crisis. #MAGA?
57 2018-06-07 23:52:22 Liquid Fossil fuels, the side product is plastics. These are mostly man made combinations that don't go away into non-harmful sub units.  Glass mostly goes back to the sand like rock it was once. We have sucked out of the ground 100's of cubic miles of Oil and coal, We trashed it

60 2018-06-07 23:52:05 Sonic is gross af 

Them fools don’t change the cooking oil like ever.
61 2018-06-07 23:52:02 Which tax cuts? Are you seeing any more money in your paychecks? Are you paying more at the pump? In the grocery store? Tax cuts for the wealthy, not for regular people. Trump is a snake oil salesman.
62 2018-06-07 23:51:58 一番前wwwねれないww
63 2018-06-07 23:51:22 Either way, with oil sands returning only $300m in royalties per year, there is a big gap.

Industry is getting a free ride here, that much is obvious. Keep in mind, most of these operators may be bankrupt in 15 to 20 years...

71 2018-06-07 23:50:28 Ottawa is not just buying the #TransMountain pipeline from #KinderMorgan.

88 2018-06-07 23:48:35 CBD oil is what my one friend recommends!
89 2018-06-07 23:48:14 I'll have to try that and I do like mixing olive oil with sugar on the hands. Rub lightly and rinse off with warm water. Dry hands.
90 2018-06-07 23:48:08 Do you suffer from anxiety or depression?  Have you considered cbd oil?
91 2018-06-07 23:48:03 — Nakahara still felt horrible. As if all the blood in his body has been replaced with oil, just waiting to be burned from the inside.

The redheaded mafioso Chiat let his head droop, only the sound of the rushing water being his company.
92 2018-06-07 23:47:59 3 days in a row my dinner has consisted of a salad with 2 avocados  w/ salt, pepper, olive oil and hot sauce #lordhavemercy #addictive #eatinghealthy
93 2018-06-07 23:47:37 I was trying to avoid eating out as much as I could since money is right but I suffered my first cooking disaster. Should pay attention to the type of oil recommended for a recipe. Good thing Subway has $2 sandwiches.

100 2018-06-07 23:46:43 Which seems to have the same effect as calling oil water-oil would make oil more compatible with water? (That's a real question mark.)
101 2018-06-07 23:46:40 Today I bought a new camera, but what I’m more excited about is that I also got an oil change and car wash for the first time in a year.  Still not sure how my car has made it so far. #adulting #amIthough?
102 2018-06-07 23:45:48 The doubling of electricity rates is one, if not, the biggest issue facing the vast majority of our 500,000 people. It cannot be allowed to happen; oil revenue must be used to keep them down !

107 2018-06-07 23:45:16 Have you tried using exfoliation gloves and African black soap? I take care of my tush due to dancing and sitting on dirty surfaces. Those two things really help! And a nice unscented lotion or soothing oil or shea butter.
108 2018-06-07 23:45:00 tea tree oil is a good spot treatment, but witch hazel is a rly good toner
109 2018-06-07 23:44:56 We've been accused of banning products from Alberta (we haven't). We've been accused of sourcing palm oil from conflict regions (we don't). Lastly, we've been accused of being paid off by George Soros/Al Gore (do we even need to defend this?)

119 2018-06-07 23:43:29 It takes lots of water to produce those crops and land. It takes lots of oil, creates lots of CO2 because of all the crops that have to be harvested for feed by tractors, transportation of that feed etc. none of that’s eliminated even if you addressed the waste issue.

126 2018-06-07 23:42:42 News that scientists may have discovered the building blocks of oil on Mars is good news indeed. Build that pipeline. We could be looking at another 2,000 years of fossil fuel use!

149 2018-06-07 23:38:15 Canadian oil, Canadian jobs, Canadian shareholders, meanwhile importing Saudi oil & losing millions per day. Ya, great job liberals.
150 2018-06-07 23:38:10 he cherry picks (excuse the pun) to further his personal vegan agenda. I've nothing against veganism, but where cancer is concerned, he is just another snake oil salesman.

152 2018-06-07 23:37:42 So how isn't thia just Oceans 11 with dresses.  Sandra Bullock acts like George Clooney....and Cate Blanchett is Brad Pitt (and dressed like him).  How is this original.
153 2018-06-07 23:37:05 asked this nigga to change my oil and the bitch never texted back , oh yea got his ass right where i want him .
154 2018-06-07 23:37:03 Id b very wary of giving up on #27 after 1 down year,especially if ur bringing back an older player with a bad contract.Oil need to stop selling low and losing trades.If youtrade #77 whos your long term replacement? Cant be #2 or #4 can it? Maybe for a yr or 2, then what? #oilers
155 2018-06-07 23:36:56 Es correcto, la empresa petrolera con mayor capacidad de producción en el mundo es Saudi Aramco, propiedad del Estado Saudi, la segunda es la rusa Gazprom y la tercera es National Iranian Oil. 

Pero la más rentable es Statoil.

156 2018-06-07 23:36:52 They have dates for eating.I think u forgotten. When they have no information about oil. They used to produce dates .how about you?
157 2018-06-07 23:36:49 This abhorrent invasion must be stopped. Giving up palm oil products alone is not enough 
158 2018-06-07 23:36:29 Es mejor hacer las cosas sin importar lo que pase a que no hacerla por miedo y luego arrepentirse
159 2018-06-07 23:36:22 وينكم انقذونا من هالنقابه الظعيفه اللي ظيعتنا وظيعت حقوقنا
160 2018-06-07 23:36:21 A customer said she liked my eyebrows today and i was like thanks I fill them in lollll I need some coconut oil to start thickening them out 
161 2018-06-07 23:36:17 I know & agree. Problem: the term climate change allows Big Oil to pay  lawyers to argue climate change is natural using pre-industrial age ice core samples, sun cycles, etc. No one can argue pollution; it’s definitively measurable. It’s also cause of climate change. Make sense?

164 2018-06-07 23:35:41 Where are you getting that stat?  Their oil industry is state owned.  Private ind was strangled by price controls, & resulted in supply shortages of basic goods.  Socialism is the DIRECT cause of their hyperinflation(700%) & contracting economy since the socialist roll out of ‘99

167 2018-06-07 23:34:47 Contrariwise, when the plane lands or takes off at transit airports, it actually burns more fuel, than a steady flight. 
Anyway, it's the passenger who pays the price every time, as a few years back, the oil price dropped, but the air tickets didn't!
168 2018-06-07 23:34:26 おはよ〜！！

170 2018-06-07 23:34:16 Go to @QuickLane to get my oil changed. Leave with parts of my undercarriage missing... I think it's time to move on from @Ford.

174 2018-06-07 23:33:55 Simply the cost of allowing dark money the ability to control political parties & elections. Oil & Gas. Fracking.  Harold Hamm. All of which may make Scott Pruitt untouchable not matter what he does, just like his boss.
175 2018-06-07 23:33:51 my car got broken into and the only thing they stole was my owners manual and my insurance/registration/title.
i have a bong, a military dry bag, oil, shoes/clothes, windshield wipers and lots of change in there.
and they steal those.

178 2018-06-07 23:33:24 Santa Cruz had an awesome Youth Hostel back in thee day. i met some early 20s Irishman on holiday. He'd been working as an engineer building an oil rig miles off the tip of So Africa, way down into the ocean, tripped me out.
179 2018-06-07 23:33:16 Where are the SNP getting leaded petrol from?
I thought the oil was a reserved matter.
180 2018-06-07 23:33:02 burying black people out of sight and out of mind while extracting our culture, our dollars, our entertainment like oil - black gold, ghettoizing and demeaning our creations then stealing them,
181 2018-06-07 23:32:58 When that oil change & new air filter got your shit running good 
182 2018-06-07 23:32:56 Trump's fault also. Maybe the Jews as well.
183 2018-06-07 23:32:38 Almost half of all cars on the road leak oil or other toxic fluids
184 2018-06-07 23:32:32 I think my “alternative” makes more sense...

Pruitt: MY HANDS ARE DRY
Perry: I’LL DRILL FOR OIL 
Zinke: OUR PARKS ARE OPEN! 
CHAO: USE GAS GUZZLERS

Pruitt: I HATE AIR QUALITY 
Perry: I’LL USE COAL TOO

CHAO: MITCH WILL SAY YES
185 2018-06-07 23:32:24 @DesignCoDubai Oil is a great subsidy for backwardness!

189 2018-06-07 23:31:36 What lies? 

About you indirectly stating your preference for mideast oil over Alberta oil?

About you wanting to stop a project that will create wealth for Canada, particularly Alberta & BC?

About you hoping your false virtue signaling will increase sales?

These are facts.
190 2018-06-07 23:31:33 Bruh if I stand up my spine is gonna end up in an oil rig in Afghanistan not even joking

193 2018-06-07 23:31:16 They should have a sign saying that they sell hemp oil or hemp/ CBD products.
The gummies here you can get about 10 of them with 15 mg each for $21 that's including tax.
194 2018-06-07 23:31:14 Yum- quick and easy: toss kale with olive oil salt&pepper. Bake 375 for 15 min. Serve w/salmon! #healthyeating #fitover50
195 2018-06-07 23:31:06 She just made the reasonable point that oil and gas has miraculous benefits.  

Obviously we need to be concerned also about the impacts.  

But we don't need a cure that's worse than the disease.
196 2018-06-07 23:31:02 CAn we talk about drilling for oil off our coast?  Too soon?  Or is that not on your agenda.
197 2018-06-07 23:31:01 It’s the license plate on my @Tesla and it means F*ck Oil :)
198 2018-06-07 23:30:43 What about an administration that allowed a terrorist force to illegally take treaty land, then illegally surveil oil protesters, that took that surveillance and tracked down said protesters, that then illegally detained said protesters in dog kennels? #tytlive

202 2018-06-07 23:30:16 It's awesome that you're using better packaging and RSPO certified palm oil  but I also want to avoid damage to the environment, farm workers & animals along with avoiding plastic. I appreciate that you'll look into it though! #georganicsuk #ecofriendly
203 2018-06-07 23:30:15 Yeah, the hezbollahis are a bunch of real dumbf-cks. The only things that have saved them are the facts that they have oil, and their enemies are a bunch of dumbf-cks, too.
204 2018-06-07 23:29:59 I'm not panicking yet. All organic means is molecules with carbon atoms. Carbon's everywhere. The Russians have been drilling for oil since the 1950s based on the theory that the Earth makes its own oil from internal processes. Who can argue with their results?
205 2018-06-07 23:29:24 You did not think through the consequences of your policies. Many, many people in Canada support fossil fuel industries and want more development of coal, oil and gas. Did you not know this? How could you not?
206 2018-06-07 23:29:21 Okay, gunna buy stock in olive oil just in case.
207 2018-06-07 23:29:20 sis idk why america gotta go fight wars overseas to find oil considering my shiny ass t-zone could power a million ford f-150s for like 32 years

213 2018-06-07 23:28:34 I meant oii not oil damn auto correct

215 2018-06-07 23:27:22 We’re the SUNSHINE STATE. Clean solar energy is where it’s at. Florida has historically opposed offshore oil drilling for good reason!

217 2018-06-07 23:27:13 Is that sarcasm? Do you think racism, killing animals, and oil spills, and melting glaciers helps tourism to #Alaska?   
218 2018-06-07 23:27:01 This is a bit of a snake oil argument, he ain't Charles Manson and sorry Ken but you haven't really said anything here man.
219 2018-06-07 23:26:51 tea tree oil. that’s it.
220 2018-06-07 23:26:46 I have hemp oil for my vape. Vaping it's supposed to have an immediate effect. All it takes is a few minutes and I feel better. It's really helped me with my headaches and cramps. I've even tried the gummies they're pretty good and cheap. They take a little bit longer to hit.
221 2018-06-07 23:26:45 The Russians are not fans of Trump if they were why did they send over 500 Russian mercenaries to attack soldiers guarding an oil refinery in Syria? Trump has pushed the oil industry into being the biggest oil producer in the world Russia is hurting badly because of it.
222 2018-06-07 23:26:29 Facebook. Ko o oil o k
223 2018-06-07 23:26:28 @rorysutherland I knew an Irish journalist who, after leaving university went and worked an an oil rig for two years so he could be “good at two things”. A bright career in energy news followed.
224 2018-06-07 23:26:22 Aah yes... the magical satisfying feeling of changing your car's motor oil and differential oil, which was black as pure coal, that makes you just sit back in your driver's seat in complete contentment.
225 2018-06-07 23:26:15 why does Murad have so much stuff this is crazy lol me too tho i use their oil control mattifier it literally takes all the oil away with a downside of leaving your skin dehydrated af
226 2018-06-07 23:26:04 Just now my olive oil wouldn’t scan at Kroger so I called the guy working over to help and he asked how much it was so he could just type it in, and when I told him the price he muttered “damn girl this the nectar of the gods or something” and anyway now I think we’re married
227 2018-06-07 23:25:55 Where the few beleagured human inhabitants huddle in the light of a guttering whale oil lamp while polar bears and the flesh eating dead haunt the eternal twilight. Their swollen, frozen claws red with the blood of the living.
228 2018-06-07 23:25:43 The real wise Iranians do realize that defending Palestine is defensing Iran , because these Zionists are so interested to capture Iran oil and Market , you can see how they are dealing with their best friend Saudi,
229 2018-06-07 23:25:26 I’m on a no spend but I really want an essential oil diffuser for the living room 
230 2018-06-07 23:25:16 Not quite fair. 1) much less space is needed than for the equivalent amount of CO2 capture by trees. 2) it provides a  liquid fuel instead of burning new oil etc. Much depends on energy sources & other resources needed to realize.
If it works, all should like, indep of politics.

233 2018-06-07 23:24:38 And hence, why they need the sanctions lifted so that Exxon can buy the $500 billion oil from Rosneft, and save Putin.
234 2018-06-07 23:24:25 That's why you clean and oil your gun or carry a revolver.
235 2018-06-07 23:24:14 Don't forget that lots of oil comes from Texas, a state where anti-Obama hysteria often led to people making bad decisions out of fear of the government.
236 2018-06-07 23:24:04 This is terrible news, but not surprising, so what's the plan? Rev up #Plastic and #Oil campaigning?
237 2018-06-07 23:23:45 A pea-sized amount of baby oil can act as a shine hair serum before dashing out the door.
238 2018-06-07 23:23:34 I mean I like Chick-fil-A. Plus you got the lo cholesterol peanut oil so is it really cheating?
239 2018-06-07 23:23:30 And while we focus on that list he's gutted the EPA, blocked scientists from serving on the board, and hired former lobbyists from big oil, gas, and coal. Pruitt is nuts, but he's also slowly killing the planet. Not sure if this sleight of hand is a strategy, but it's working.
240 2018-06-07 23:23:26 Apparently the morons think the U of A gave him the degree BECAUSE he doesn’t support the oil sands? Why else would they have so much sand in their personal lubricant?

244 2018-06-07 23:22:38 It doesn't matter how green we go we will still need oil and gas. I want as much as anyone to be greener but we have to also deal with reality. We live in the northern hemisphere it's cold, less sunlight, hard to get around plus vast expanse. Reality check please.
245 2018-06-07 23:22:33 The secret to happiness is to see all the marvels of the world, and never to forget the drops of oil on the spoon.

261 2018-06-07 23:20:50 Attention Rex Manning fans, to your left you will notice a shoplifter being chased by night manager, Lucas. This young man will be caught, deep fried in a vat of hot oil and served to our first hundred customers. Just another tasty treat from the gang at Empire Records.

269 2018-06-07 23:19:56 ....and our economy is how much larger? All factors must come into play - but go ahead and tax Solar panals whilst playing to Putin who has a country where the largest export is oil. What side are you on? While you're at it, why not blame Canada for the Vietnam war, #Dotard
270 2018-06-07 23:19:50 Headline: 3 Billion year old organic material found on Mars. Reading the article reveals that 2 drill samples “yielded complex organic molecules that look strikingly similar to the goopy fossilized building blocks of oil and gas on Earth.” Do you see the difference?

281 2018-06-07 23:18:11 Put on a brand new shirt an got oil on it I should just be naked all the time
282 2018-06-07 23:18:06 It's best to cook eggs quickly though on a relatively high heat. Ideally with a mix of butter and oil such as canola that has a higher smoke point, since when doing things like scrambled eggs you want the eggs cooked in something like 30 seconds for good thicc curdles.
283 2018-06-07 23:17:54 Yup, typical socialist, will do anything to dodge the real issues. Funny how all of the US oil bearing states are completely booming right now, and they have a conservative president. Alberta should be booming and it’s barely even moving because no investors and red tape
284 2018-06-07 23:17:35 Have you tried CBD oil?
285 2018-06-07 23:17:35 Damn you called it, Rosie. Who knew so many Americans would fall for snake oil? And then refuse to admit they got conned? This SUCKS.
286 2018-06-07 23:17:33 They have always do all their worst to silence Igbo business men. Ibeto was hampered by Obasanjo terror now GOD have shamed these lazy idiots that want to seat and share oil money from the South. Great Victory my brother
287 2018-06-07 23:17:23 It's apparent to all that you push for so called free trade to advance the Big Oil agenda. Your goal, no matter the human suffering or environmental damage is to get each country hooked on oil. Regardless of consequences Big Oils days are numbered as EVs, Solar & batteries assend
288 2018-06-07 23:17:23 “People will always buy our debt, no matter what” is a really good philosophy. 

Until suddenly it isn’t. 

And it will be sudden, and have something to do with buying oil in non-dollar currencies.

292 2018-06-07 23:16:19 Old fashioned thinking Republicans drunk on oil & looking backwards, including @lisamurkowski @SenDanSullivan @repdonyoung & @AkGovBillWalker we need new ideas & innovative thinking - that’s a lot of debt for a small population

295 2018-06-07 23:15:48 If you're not here for the singer at the Boardwalk, lathered in baby oil, wearing tie dye yoga pants and chains, playing the sax at the beginning of Lost Boys: please leave.

297 2018-06-07 23:15:27 Because it wasn't a consequence of Obama's policies.

Trump's hostility towards Iran, softness on Russia, and general rudeness towards our allies is a DIRECT cause of rising oil

299 2018-06-07 23:15:21 Congratulations to Mr. Suzuki for the honourary degree! Kudos to the U. of A. for upholding the principles of a university by not succumbing to the pressure to withdraw the degree. Alberta is so much more than oil and pipelines.

314 2018-06-07 23:13:03 We can't wait for the men in media calendar to come out - @garethwasik has already got the oil for his #DadBod
315 2018-06-07 23:12:57 here’s hoping sleeping with coconut oil in my hair over night will make me feel more like I put effort into being a girl and that.
316 2018-06-07 23:12:51 I don't have a horse in HB331 but isn't that a little misleading? It will make it so we don't have to pay about $900 million of oil credits, so on net it doesn't actually increase spending that much
317 2018-06-07 23:12:37 That’s baby oil... ugh
318 2018-06-07 23:12:33 Hope there funding gets totally cut off by the oil and gas sector. That man is a idiot
319 2018-06-07 23:12:07 Won't happen.  Nothing will change.  Just another snake oil seller if words.
320 2018-06-07 23:12:07 African Palm Oil is all around better for the environment. Its produced in 10 countries across West and Central Africa, and is being looked towards to help build up their economies, and also to produce more eco friendly fuels and products to sell...
321 2018-06-07 23:12:04 You know who benifets from high oil prices?
322 2018-06-07 23:12:00 I comment with my name, so you'd know.

I'd assume oil when bearded, aside from that?
323 2018-06-07 23:11:58 Now I'm curios about Ritz Carlton lotion
Does it have coconut oil, cocoa butter, or shea butter anywhere in there?

330 2018-06-07 23:10:42 Nancy you f..king ass hole. You know that the primary reason for the increase in oil prices is that the Saudi's cut production. It has nothing to do with Trump or the tax cut. Your boy Obozo did his best to reduce oil production in the US. Obozo reduced access to government land

332 2018-06-07 23:10:38 I work in the oil industry. Tomorrow we have our charity skeet shooting competition. You know how fucking hard it’s going to be for me to not yell “MAGA!!!!!!!!!!” after every shot I take
333 2018-06-07 23:10:36 Yes. Anyone who wants to change our society's dependence on oil - should just wave their magic wands, or power their stuff with Mr Fusion units instead.  

Or maybe it's more complicated, and *infrastructure* needs to be changed to support useful choices for sustainable practice.

364 2018-06-07 23:06:35 Me: "Google, is ______ healthy to eat?"

Google: "Sure! Just make sure it doesn't have sugar, fructose, sucralose, aspartame, salt, fat, oil, carbs, gluten, refined wheat or artificial coloring, that it isn't processed, is 100% natural, is organic and contains at least 50% kale."
365 2018-06-07 23:06:26 And here comes the appeal to authority.

Look back at history, Edward, the consensus in science has a long, long history of being utterly wrong. Just look at peak oil and mass starvation as two recent predictions of doom from the consensus.

367 2018-06-07 23:06:09 I love coconut oil
368 2018-06-07 23:06:08 I was agreeing with you.  We were the biggest exporter of oil.  At one point, we surpassed Saudi Arabia in oil exports.
369 2018-06-07 23:06:07 It typically has some cocoa butter (oil) as an ingredient. But that doesn't make it chocolate in my book. Cocoa oil is no more cocoa than olive oil is an olive.
370 2018-06-07 23:05:58 lol goddammit. I forgot she was a social media stalker... The answer is $250-$1500 depending on who does the oil change

372 2018-06-07 23:05:40 If I ran EU, I'd just say to UK pay the bar bill you have signed up to for the next six years and just go and wipe Trump's arse and don't revisit the bar. But give Northern Ireland a free vote in uniting Ireland and let Scotland go it alone and stop stealing their oil #bbcqt

385 2018-06-07 23:03:38 Of course you've totally ignored Capex on the Clair Ridge (£4.5 billion I believe) and the tax exemption for new oil fields West of Shetland.
386 2018-06-07 23:03:33 I also got their no-sebum powder, finally! They’re selling a limited edition birthstone design, and mine is for March. Hoping it will keep the oil at bay and prevent my face from melting into a puddle this summer!

436 2018-06-07 22:57:10 Pele. Vets usually give Valium Sha. So if you take it to another vet, they might recommend giving it Valium. Idk about palm oil. Buy you definitely need a vet to help. Just monitor the dog till it stops and make sure there plenty ventilation to avoid overheating

444 2018-06-07 22:56:09 I think coconut oil would be better than lauric acid. I just read the ingredient deck in a new Keto product and it contained: 
• sodium hexametaphosphate
• acesulfame potassium 
• sucralose 
• maltodextrin 
• canola oil 
The very ingredients you want to avoid if on Keto 4 CI
445 2018-06-07 22:56:08 @GordonRamsay Dude, real quick question. Should i add oil to my spaghetti when cooking? I'm asking for a friend, you know.
446 2018-06-07 22:56:03 There’s enough oil in my hair to make a grilled cheese sandwich... 
447 2018-06-07 22:56:02 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.

457 2018-06-07 22:55:02 ahh...... i love having my oil changed and being told my car is being destroyed from the inside out by my cost-saving negligence
458 2018-06-07 22:54:58 So most of you will see this as obvious but boiling oil to the eye really hurts. 
459 2018-06-07 22:54:57 Yep...@Valvoline is a damn good motor oil..I use it in my current car and the other two before that..
460 2018-06-07 22:54:53 i made the couscous w| olive oil, rosemary, basil & sea salt. and the chicken was marinating since this morning. that alone mixed w| the harissa..

462 2018-06-07 22:54:37 I’m skeptical about wearing glow oil cuz I’m not tryna cook and get sunburn this summer
463 2018-06-07 22:54:22 it looks like aside from an oil change my car also needs a new tire, new wipers, new air filter, and a transmission check

467 2018-06-07 22:53:58 hmmmm ... shouldn't WV learn how to survive on its own ... you know cause of big government and all? Think about what WV could do with Wind Farms and Solar Fields ... think of the training and jobs and the better health for your constituents. But you want them beholden to Oil $$$
468 2018-06-07 22:53:48 i've been using cbd oil (mouth drops) and pills for my pain & anxiety, it's helping a lot. it doesn't get you high & you can buy it legally anywhere :)
469 2018-06-07 22:53:28 You can turn it back into oil, yes it’s costly but only because no one is doing it. The idea that there is nothing to be done is spurious capitalist nonsense

471 2018-06-07 22:52:50 You know why we haven't spent trillions of dollars to help in Puerto Rico after nearly 5000 Americans have died?

You can't invade and bomb a hurricane then exploit it for oil.
472 2018-06-07 22:52:40 So what if Birdmsn doesn't have the money because he spent it all on oil rig tattoos?
473 2018-06-07 22:52:23 At $100 dollar a barrel and Losal reducing production cost to $3 that’s $97 profit for every barrel. If we taxed them the same way Norway has then, maybe an Oil fund of 1 Trillion which is what Norway has achieved while we entered UKs debt spiral
474 2018-06-07 22:52:21 My house always smells like syrup or maybe my fatass just always smell syrup lol this dam chocolate oil warmer
475 2018-06-07 22:52:13 Yeah, I haven't changed the oil yet, but I have it ready. Is just the schedule and my condition which keep me away from doing it.

477 2018-06-07 22:52:01 Psalms 55:21 The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet were they drawn swords.  What smooth words did these Colonizers use ?  “I come in peace”.  But war is in their heart always.
478 2018-06-07 22:51:49 Love to be all over that, I do have a very tasty message oil.

484 2018-06-07 22:50:31 In the following days I can not go anywhere. Not just that I have this opened wound on my leg, but also Mitsu needs a complete checkup, oil and filters change, intake cleanup, and then the PTI. Hope I won't need to squeeze too much...
485 2018-06-07 22:50:30 I grew up with Dem. parents... Republicans were oil company tycoons & big business trying to stiff the working man. But now, #liberal / #conservative has morphed into a social #ideology. I no longer recognize, nor can embrace, my liberal background.

488 2018-06-07 22:49:52 the fact that some people can just sit outside for twenty minutes and turn a gorgeous shade of honey without lathering themselves in tanning oil is a scam
489 2018-06-07 22:49:40 by useless I mean cdb only oil. Cbd with some thc (entourage effect) is what I'm referring to
490 2018-06-07 22:49:35 I probably have never drank this much water till I been out here in the oil field lol
491 2018-06-07 22:49:19 Oil revenues were £2.2 billion in 2014-15, the average price of Brent Crude in 2014 was $99. Of course there's been a tax cut to the industry since then (at the request of  Swinney, see link above). If you're expecting oil revenues to reach 11-12 levels don't hold your breath
492 2018-06-07 22:49:17 油を英訳すると、なんて言うか知ってるかい?
493 2018-06-07 22:49:05 i sat in olive oil and DID NOT NOTICE FOR SEVERAL HOURS
494 2018-06-07 22:49:04 Which part of "there aren't enough tanker trailers and rail cars to load 15 million barrels of oil per day, over a set period of time, to make a proper comparison" you don't understand????
495 2018-06-07 22:49:02 I almost lost my life the other day on a puddle of water covered in oil smh. I spun completely out spun in circles and ended up in somebody's lawn  I swear my car is a curse and a blessing at the same damn time lol
496 2018-06-07 22:49:00 CORRECTION: He was an oil & gas industry lackey/lickspittle with strong religious convictions that God LOVE, LOVE, LOVES it when humans to dig up and burn carbon fuel sources. So not really an executive. (please continue)
497 2018-06-07 22:48:51 Girl put some oil in that hair

499 2018-06-07 22:48:38 Ex.29:19-22 In the offering of a SECOND RAM, some of the BLOOD would be MIXED w/the ANOINTING OIL and SPRINKLED on Aaron & his sons & on their garments. In this way he & his garments would become holy as well as his sons & their garments.
500 2018-06-07 22:48:22 Technically this last one wasn’t for oil. If you investigate we haven’t taken Iraq’s oil. However, I do agree. We must stop intervening in others affairs.
501 2018-06-07 22:48:21 Oil economy culture
502 2018-06-07 22:48:03 Coconut oil or butter can clog your pores causing more flare ups. I know coconut oil is such a staple, but it’s highly comedogenic.
503 2018-06-07 22:48:02 I said she a desperate yet very creative oil painter who just wants to travel the world and date a hot Italian while freelancing
504 2018-06-07 22:47:58 Apply sunscreen and then tanning oil #skincaretips

506 2018-06-07 22:47:30 No it's not a carbon tax that afforded you the money on attic insulation...

Its Alberta oilsands Government/Oil Company reimbursement or Hazzard fund. The oil/gas companies pay the Alberta Government an annual % amount based on revenue..it's their selloff of resources slush 1/2
507 2018-06-07 22:47:29 Boycott palm oil!
508 2018-06-07 22:47:27 would like to recommend if anyone follows you tries the krill, fish oil supplement to get tested before and after....best for all supplements, but especially krill...very strong stuff
509 2018-06-07 22:47:23 We sell bio oil in my store. It's my top selling cosmetic item every week without fail. I've never used it but always heard good things x
510 2018-06-07 22:47:18 Doug Ford (who inherited his wealth) does believe in the market economy and in capitalism I assume.  How is he going to influence global crude prices and dictate how oil companies set their refined gas prices?  Voodoo Economics. Keep dreaming.
511 2018-06-07 22:47:16 Must have’s:
-orange juice
-green tea

512 2018-06-07 22:47:14 My auntie said my essential oil diffusers bothered her sinuses so I have to unplug them 
513 2018-06-07 22:47:09 Too much olive oil...
514 2018-06-07 22:47:08 Found out this week, @ToyotaMotorCorp Motor Company won't fix my Camry which burns oil! Never notified me of the problem despite knowing about it and fixing cars if you happened to learn about the problem. Said the extended warranty expired. That will be my last Toyota!
515 2018-06-07 22:47:07 I like your style Tim - any chance you can get me this beautiful ladies phone number - my car needs oil 
516 2018-06-07 22:47:07 Chef Ramses cut up some acne, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was some  human flesh, along with Silly Putty.
517 2018-06-07 22:46:55 Or maybe it’s just the international price of oil, which I recall went up considerably under OBAMA and you were silent.
518 2018-06-07 22:46:55 WE LOVE VITAMIN E OIL SHES THE GOAT
519 2018-06-07 22:46:46 Yup! She coming to the house with blessed oil next visit.
520 2018-06-07 22:46:16 Best of luck once we cut off the water and oil.
521 2018-06-07 22:46:14 I only use coconut oil nothing else.
522 2018-06-07 22:46:08 Try castor oil, hair oil, and illegal immigration.
523 2018-06-07 22:46:06 Obviously he’s not selling snake oil because Tom Brady is 40 and still the best quarterback in the league. What a stupid take.
524 2018-06-07 22:45:54 The Madness of the Orange Sphicter wanted this to happen so that we would purchase oil from Russia
525 2018-06-07 22:45:52 I just put coconut oil on my belly and now my dog won’t stop licking me
526 2018-06-07 22:45:49 Eggs, veggie oil, rice vinegar... and I'm sure it's the MSG that's really hitting you in the sweet spot. Haha.
527 2018-06-07 22:45:13 Haaaaaahaha
528 2018-06-07 22:45:04 おはよ〜(*╹▽╹*)
529 2018-06-07 22:44:59 So my mom keep buying this Indian hair oil thingy that is supposes to make your strong and all that ! I just used it and GAWD that thing  smells  like straight   SHIT!
530 2018-06-07 22:44:52 @FoxNews Burn pits have been used by the military as far back as the beginning of wars.  My Army company used one just before exiting Desert Storm. Not to mention the Kuwaiti Oil well fires started by Iraqi troops. The veterans administration was dysfunctional, about time
531 2018-06-07 22:44:49 probably right when it comes to these weird unemployment numbers...
We all know how USA count that. 
(They only count 3Ms (3 month no ask for work is counted - all others not..)
But the stock exchange is pretty high. And (and that is funny to me) gold and oil also.
532 2018-06-07 22:44:48 Hope you're using air fryers rather than oil fryers, as air fryer are healthier, easier to clean, reduce expense & labor of oil, recycling the oil. Air fryers do great tater tots, nice & crispy
533 2018-06-07 22:44:44 guys iyang gipangayo kay oil because "shiny forehead, shiny life"
534 2018-06-07 22:44:44 Oil Man was running from Terra and FEELS ALIVE!
535 2018-06-07 22:44:29 I am no scientist but try a partial emulsion of 2 parts vinegar and 3 parts oil with a pinch of salt.
536 2018-06-07 22:44:25 Where do we get the money ? Always a familiar line on #bbcqt - Norway is on the couch laughing with their trillion dollar global investment oil fund.
537 2018-06-07 22:44:22 それほど、昨日の采配はひどかった
538 2018-06-07 22:44:21 I’ve learned water & oil are my best friend  it’s definitely a task
539 2018-06-07 22:44:15 Ah, gotta love people trying to blame the company you work for for breaking their computer. "Does filling your car with gas or getting oil changes break you car? No? Neither do software updates surprisingly enough"
540 2018-06-07 22:43:55 You have a trade surplus with Canada. Time to cut of the oil.
(45% of your domestic supply).
541 2018-06-07 22:43:48 一晩たってもおさまらん
542 2018-06-07 22:43:41 omg I was skeptical about tanning oil and it really works. I am no longer yellow lol
543 2018-06-07 22:43:28 Speaking of, a bitch started messing around with oil thinking my skin is tough only for my eyes to swell up and itch. Sigh.
544 2018-06-07 22:43:15 Because he's a weird guy teaching weird shit. He's selling snake oil.
545 2018-06-07 22:43:08 How our the oil wars you've supported kept us safe? How is increasing the risk of blowback keeping us safe? How does neoliberalism you support keeping us safe? Doesn't matter how many millions you sleep with, there's a lot of blood on those "liberal" hands.
546 2018-06-07 22:43:03 ら〜油おはよう！
547 2018-06-07 22:42:49 Yes, that blue wave in California was incredible......not!  Students who know nothing, moms do carry guns and the old hippies who now have hip C in very high numbers, I am so not worried!!
548 2018-06-07 22:42:45 Depuis l’époque où on aimait antho c’est pareil pour oil
549 2018-06-07 22:42:41 How to cook asparagus: roast in oven at 450F with avocado oil, salt, and pepper for 15 minutes, ignore the beeping timer, scream "Oh no, the ASPARAGUS!" as you run to the oven before retrieving it just before it's inedible. 
550 2018-06-07 22:42:34 no problem and good luck! Be careful to see if the coconut oil has an adverse effect on your skin, though, in case you're not used to using it.
551 2018-06-07 22:42:29 Very proud of myself. Off today and that comma hit the direct deposit and I didn't do anything but get my oil changed. This weekend tho....different story.
552 2018-06-07 22:42:29 Me, two years ago: my beauty routine is lip balm
Me, now: but you know castor oil can really cause puffing or swelling if you put it on your eyes but you can take that away with green tea.
553 2018-06-07 22:42:25 That's true, but let's end the middle-eastern wars for oil that cause these crisis in the first place instead of lashing out in people who don't have anything and are fleeing from miserable conditions.
554 2018-06-07 22:42:20 I feel like we are witnessing the grandest heist ever made, and that is the sale of turkana oil. They're doing it in plain sight. I can't even hate. Simply brilliant

556 2018-06-07 22:41:35 Getting an oil change and I can hear them talk about how fucked up my car is lol
557 2018-06-07 22:41:21 Surprised by the distance or the species? The North Sea Bord club have records of bbees from up to 52 km offshore - on oil rigs, and a number of species have turned up.
558 2018-06-07 22:41:12 The way I’ve just been scrubbing my tan off for atleast an hour ohh my daaaaays tried baby oil coffee scrub exfoliator the LOT my skin is basically in bits now
559 2018-06-07 22:41:10 Somebody that willfully tries to kill somebody is a murderer.Period. A murderer wearing a fancy green costume is still a murderer. Enough of this war hero bullshit. And don't buy gov propaganda:the only reason why they did 9/11 and Iraq/Afghanistan wars is to sell weapons and oil
560 2018-06-07 22:41:03 He’s a snake oil salesman
561 2018-06-07 22:41:02 hmm well I cut mine into like 1/2 inch disks, heat up 1 tsp of oil in a nonstick, lay them all down in the oil and then just flip them after like a two minutes!
562 2018-06-07 22:41:01 I decided to grow my beard out again, so got some new beard oil. My face now smells like a Christmas tree. 

Not mad
563 2018-06-07 22:40:55 We have spent a lot yes. Don’t disagree but it’s not oil money, it’s through good strategy. Anyway leave it there. Have a good night pal

566 2018-06-07 22:40:28 @MSNBC Scott #Pruitt is a slime ball. Slimy because he's covered in black oil & gas money. A ball because he loves rolling in this sh*t. Pruitt was a secretive little rat in #Oklahoma so am not surprised to learn fracking king Harold Hamm may be protecting him, among others. #EPA

572 2018-06-07 22:39:45 the indonesian rainforest is by far at greatest risk of total decimation. it’s mostly due to palm oil plantations. It’s so sad, but I really don’t know what we can do. It’s sadly in the hands of unorganized governments in the third world. their priority is developing economically

578 2018-06-07 22:38:34 Canada also has more fresh water lakes than anyplace else,plenty of oil and plenty of softwood lumber, they will do fine. Tariffs have a funny way of coming back to bite u, how are those reverse steel tariffs, costing u more than Canada, fool
579 2018-06-07 22:38:23 Honestly no I'm more convinced of it than ever but you sat in olive oil on the train so you're clearly still a mere mortal
580 2018-06-07 22:38:00 @LucasRacingTV can you guys next year show more of the @lucasdirt An @ProPulling events live on the app an all the lucas Oil late model big shows live on it be cool
581 2018-06-07 22:37:36 Oil Companies never forced ppl to use their product, it’s a choice. It has made life easier for the human population for many years, there wasn’t many alternatives but environmentalists, although they enjoyed the benefits of fossil fuels, now want to blame the Oil Cos.
582 2018-06-07 22:37:28 I think he is an underrated genius. dropped out of college at 17, becomes homeless n then turns his life around with FX by becoming a milly through pure hard work n dedication
583 2018-06-07 22:37:08 Why are we exporting the oil? Really.
584 2018-06-07 22:37:02 That's awesome! One more reason to LOVE the #Oilers

589 2018-06-07 22:36:08 Lets be fair to Alex Guerrero he’s a snake oil salesman not a drug deal
590 2018-06-07 22:36:04 not just putting it in, but massaging the roots to ensure the scalp is thoroughly nourished. I think you'll find tutorials on yt about how to really do it, but adding coconut oil to morccan oil might help overall. Best resultsif you do this up to 3 times a week, in my experience
591 2018-06-07 22:36:02 It’s not quite there yet, but think Bayer is the Standard Oil of ag chemicals?
592 2018-06-07 22:36:00 Thought I was putting on sun lotion yesterday, later found out that it was enhancing oil. Naturally i got burnt to a crisp 
593 2018-06-07 22:35:58 yep, harder than drilling for oil, and worth much much less!
594 2018-06-07 22:35:53 I’m gonna warn every food company right now, that if you list soybean oil as an ingredient but do not list soy under the contains allergen section I’m comin for you. Idk when. But I’m comin

597 2018-06-07 22:35:51 What about the price of OIL?
Who benefits from sky high oil prices?
Vladimir Putin and his merry band of oligarchs. Quid pro quo?
598 2018-06-07 22:35:38 Shale oil has
A lot of LPG
Produces Low octane gasoline
Produces waxy diesel
Produces low levels of distillates

But Bloomberg still think it is the best thing since sliced bread.

600 2018-06-07 22:35:28 #30DaysWild - Day 7! We made playdough with flour, salt, water and a little oil and took it out into the garden to use it to print leaves and other natural finds. We also added herbs to make it small nice :)
601 2018-06-07 22:35:14 @EdKrassen let me correct that..according to Statistica, US imported an average of 384,000 barrels of oil per day, from Russia, in 2017.(I hope I got that right.)
602 2018-06-07 22:35:08 Again an absolute load of rubbish, the Venezuelan economy was tied to oil, that was their major export. If a country relies on say Wheat for its export, and the Wheat crop for some reason fails and the price collapses, what do you think will be the knock on effect. OOps. -
603 2018-06-07 22:35:05 But the old and lasting a long time also surely means it’s pretty bad in terms of pollution - according to the infographic. Can you run it on cooking oil?

605 2018-06-07 22:34:13 I am totally confused. If someone wants to suck a fake one, wouldn’t the real thing make more sense? How is this a lesbian thing? I am completely confused
606 2018-06-07 22:34:11 Unfortunately, not as yet... maybe a few trials, etc... I know there are cannabis farms here, for pharmaceutical experiments etc... So for medical, very soon... until then we have CBD oil.. but anything else, is illegal 
607 2018-06-07 22:33:43 It’s because people like you saying we’re spending shit loads as if we are some some monster up oil lot, dodging ffp., we are not, we are spending but we’ve recouped shit loads. Also don’t get the moaning by Utd fans about city spending, you have the money. Your problem has been
608 2018-06-07 22:33:38 If you use social media to suck me into some stupid pyramid scheme like CBD oil or pura vida bracelets, you are getting blocked immediately
609 2018-06-07 22:33:34 Can someone tell me why it takes my dad 20 min to change my oil on his own but it takes 6 guys at terribles 45 min
610 2018-06-07 22:33:19 This Lychee essential oil got me over here smelling like a hi chew! lmao 
611 2018-06-07 22:33:08 Snake oil is technically not on the banned substances list
612 2018-06-07 22:32:56 The odd thing is, if our economy suffered from a rise in oil prices, the Venezuelan economy would pick up.. Incidentally transport costs are rising, that, in turn will increase prices in both food and commodities. - Simple equations, cause and effect. -
613 2018-06-07 22:32:29 "BP, bringing oil to US shores."
614 2018-06-07 22:32:23 I can see the reason for medical marijuana, which should be legal in all states, especially CBD oil. But recreational marijuana? Why? It stays in your system. It makes people paranoid and unmotivated. And this has been scientifically proven.
615 2018-06-07 22:32:15 It looks like it starts with an aperitif of a gallon of olive oil followed by four sets of weighted dips.

621 2018-06-07 22:31:35 Two lectures this week on essential oils and lots of lavender essential oils sold. Think that the fact I told everyone it's my handbag essential convinced them! What's your favourite essential oil?
622 2018-06-07 22:31:21 Have we moved from baby oil to cryptic one word tweets? What are you doing, Ferg?
623 2018-06-07 22:31:15 Scrubs, konjac sponge, peeling gel, acids (not for beginners).

Moisturizer Simple okay je. Both Hydrating & Oil Balancing best 
624 2018-06-07 22:31:15 My coworker asked what’s that smell? I said idk maybe my hair I used black tree oil today (she smells my hair) no it’s not that she sits down nd sniffs between her legs (we both laugh) she says well I’m just checkin  I can’t with her 
625 2018-06-07 22:31:11 i used castor oil as moisturizer today cuz im trying to pinpoint this allergic reaction and chile my face is so greasy.
626 2018-06-07 22:31:10 True
Also how is it painful? If it's because it's rough or itchy, there are products for that. Personally I used jojoba oil  or a jojoba oil with Jamaican black castor oil mixture to moisturize. Also put in a few drops of peppermint oil for that tingly freshness
627 2018-06-07 22:31:00 Opinions on best oil to use to season cast iron? I'm going with flaxseed oil.
628 2018-06-07 22:30:46 Combine 4 cups cayenne pepper with 1 pound jambalaya. Add Olive Oil. Boil. Serve the next morning for breakfast.
629 2018-06-07 22:30:44 Turns out tea tree oil is not like almond oil and is SUPER POISONOUS if you rub it undiluted on your face and then get some in your mouth

I'm an idiot pass it on
630 2018-06-07 22:30:32 Not really. Prices going up due to his tariffs and oil/gas going up because he ended the Iran deal.
631 2018-06-07 22:30:29 Greta and I tanned with canola oil today...some say boofer I say innovative

634 2018-06-07 22:29:51 Many supplements are just high in lauric acid correct? Which at that point wouldn’t really give it much benefit over coconut oil itself? 
635 2018-06-07 22:29:41 That black seed oil really work cause my allergies ain’t bother me in awhile
636 2018-06-07 22:29:38 Numbers are coming out. The world economy is still expected to grow 3.1% this year despite trade concerns. The U.S. trade gap narrowed in April, largely due to Americans cutting purchases of foreign made goods while boosting exports, including a record amount of oil. #MAGA
637 2018-06-07 22:29:19 About your coconut oil? 
638 2018-06-07 22:29:16 So....friend soybean oil?  I think I'll just go to @ChickfilA.

640 2018-06-07 22:28:46 Ask yourself what happened to the Dollar during in the seventies oil spike, "big sucking sound" - Well what happened that gold went through the roof, the Dollar plummeted and there was a recession. - Could happen again and if it does, our economy goes down with a big bump.
641 2018-06-07 22:28:45 Maybe those whales went in there to get away from noise created by ships in open waters?? More likely they were hunting for food (salmon, seals) which orcas also do in Vancouver harbour too, site of the contentious oil refinery, which suggests the enviros' scares are exaggerated.
642 2018-06-07 22:28:26 1 tbsp of honey, 1 tbsp sugar, 1/2 teaspoon of vasaline and 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil... I googled it thinking it woulda been buns but it worked well for me
643 2018-06-07 22:28:07 Also as he gets older and you go to restaurants ask questions about the oil they cook their food in. Make him aware of his allergies and not to accept food from others.
644 2018-06-07 22:27:59 Can sell to the big oil alumni.  Stadium will still be too empty.
645 2018-06-07 22:27:58 Its no replacement for modern medical attention but a few drops of sweet oil in the ear always helped ear aches for me. I say give it a shot because it won't cause any harm if it doesn't work.

657 2018-06-07 22:26:15 Well, because of Trump doing away with the Iran deal, that will cause more of a oil shortage, gas will continue to rise. And, additional, his tariffs R resulting in tariffs on OUR goods. You’ll pay more 4 groceries and merchandise. So there goes any break from that Trump gave U.
658 2018-06-07 22:26:12 Wrong. The maintance is half the cost of a cookie cutter BMW. I have owned 67 AMGs mostly 65s and 600s. E55s. I spent outside of brakes and oil. A whopping 1412.00 in 6 years and 67 cars. Hmmmm

664 2018-06-07 22:25:00 @jasonfenske13 can you do a video addressing the heavily marketed "Nano particle" engine oil treatment products? The engineer in me acknowledges there might be some credence to their claims, but the skeptic in me thinks they're selling snake oil.

669 2018-06-07 22:24:20 The ONLY reason we se able to sustain the billions of humans on earth today is due to cheap and reliable energy. Oil and gas have created this miracle and you are able to tweet from your comfortable home as a result
670 2018-06-07 22:23:49 Just one cog constantly turning around, looking for other cogs to join with and for some oil (which in this case was in the form of pink gin in a can).
671 2018-06-07 22:23:48 You are a quack and a snake oil salesman. Go away
672 2018-06-07 22:23:16 Wrong again. But then again the right find it very difficult to understand cause and effect. When your major export collapses in price, your economy takes a dive, as indeed happened in the 70's when the reverse happened, oil prices soared and the US/UK economies took a dive.
673 2018-06-07 22:23:12 There goes another national treasure. Wait till they find oil then after 20 years a convenient places for new Walmarts (closed of course and holding immigrants) This gang would have my mom (GOP for life) switching sides. My dad (WW2 vet) would've joined a real live resistance!

675 2018-06-07 22:23:08 I’ve put off an oil change since May 1st because I thought it was fucking expensive. $35 later and I hate myself for making my car wait 6,000 miles.

678 2018-06-07 22:21:56 This is like comparing dumping my trash in a river with the BP oil spill. Yes, both sides did it. And yes focusing on the diaster means I'm not focusing on my error. But they're not comparable. "Both Sides" just sounds like you aren't able to critically assess the situation.

687 2018-06-07 22:20:39 they say the price at the pump comes down more slowly because they have to buy oil in advance and it cost more than the price at the time … oddly when oil goes up the effect at the pump is almost immediate …

696 2018-06-07 22:19:52 Same in my truck. It stopped once the gear oil went lower.

I was promised it would on the next visit. Was told today it would not be honored. #wordsnogood
702 2018-06-07 22:18:51 And they are still empty words of a snake oil salesman.
703 2018-06-07 22:18:42 It's much more accepted to get mad over oil spills than than not being allowed to own slaves.
704 2018-06-07 22:18:37 Putin ordered you to get Iran out of the crude oil market b/c Russia is dependent on our high gas prices. You did that for him so don’t screw it up with your Obama obsession.
705 2018-06-07 22:18:36 Venezuela spent its money and took its wealth away by throwing it around. It’s a basket case because it has nothing left. It could have weathered the oil price crash. Just nationalised it instead and (big sucking sound).
706 2018-06-07 22:18:29 There has to be a way of getting someone with real power in government in the US, UK, S Africa or Australia to become a true advocate of low carb, high fat, animal-based, high salt, unprocessed, zero vegetable oil. One person with true political influence! #LCHF #eatrealfood
707 2018-06-07 22:18:27 It would!  Breaking into the corn dog stand, burning themselves on the hot oil.  Getting into the booze....hilarity ensues.

712 2018-06-07 22:17:43 Great idea but i pray Ghana, a crude oil producing country will begin refining its own oil and reduce fuel price for her citizens.

714 2018-06-07 22:16:52 if its an oil based one it shouldn't be too bad, but if its like ranch or French it could be potentially problematic

722 2018-06-07 22:15:32 So goddamn true. Now that my skin is combination/dry after years of insane oil, I’ve realized the importance of moisturizing and feel like I can’t get enough. Any good skin oils I could try that aren’t prone to clogging pores?
723 2018-06-07 22:14:57 Venezuela and Russia will drop oil to $19.00 = 6 months = I am 100% intuition = Saudi's have a quagmire

726 2018-06-07 22:14:22 To the point of joking that the crude oil in Turkana may been an elaborate con? Am sad to be a Kenyan
727 2018-06-07 22:14:11 Everyone trusts this guy way too much.  Pretty soon, it and Google,  and others are going to need to be regulated and broken up like Standard Oil, Carnagie and Vanderbilt

735 2018-06-07 22:13:42 This slick Saab 93 came in with turbo issues. It's internal seal let go so the inlet hose got soaked with oil. We replaced the seal and hose and its running with full power!

736 2018-06-07 22:13:35 Agree, Russia's problems are not financial. It is basically the commodity curse, which has hobbled manufacturing. I remain bearish oil long-term. Also, demographics are bad. I wouldn't want to own Russian equities long term despite attractive valuations. Not so with Brazil.

750 2018-06-07 22:11:59 We'll see how long that lasts... We stopped buying your oil some time ago, your "government" (monarchy) just hasn't told you yet. Wait & see how much surplus they have now and why they are fighting each other & reigning in spending. They are shrinking..

791 2018-06-07 22:08:17 So.... you’re saying the coast is permanent, has never changed and will never change? Flooding is a figment of my imagination? Oil spills must also be imaginary. Sorry the article triggered you.
792 2018-06-07 22:08:13 So Skeptic is buying his snake oil now, too? The man thinks he and his wife have prophetic dreams, he thinks it's socially acceptable for arguments to devolve into violence, and he lists birth control with the atomic bomb as dangerous technologies. #skeptical #fail

796 2018-06-07 22:08:02 Go back to sleep nancy, gas always goes up this time of year, but how would you know unless your driver tells you. Hopefully you will be saving a lot of oil if you would retire and let someone GOP or DEM take your place that lives in the real world.
797 2018-06-07 22:07:58 After we took their oil
798 2018-06-07 22:07:16 "Trucker strike"...
Transport companies & independent truckers over-invested in a saturated market and then a bump in oil prices made them lose money.
They sure liked the free market when they were raking it in; they take a loss on their gambles and cry for taxpayer bailout.

800 2018-06-07 22:07:04 Louis DeBrusk?? Lol
801 2018-06-07 22:06:55 No, apple to apple comparison would require moving identical amounts of oil in the same time period on the road and rail vs in pipelines. I don't think that there are enough tanker trailers or rail cars to do that with current US production around 15 million barrels per day
802 2018-06-07 22:06:52 rosehip oil 
803 2018-06-07 22:06:38 Wow... Ok, I'll say it another way: If the project would have stayed in private hands and failed economically - nobody buys the oil - the pipeline would have shut down. Now, because of the protests, it's owned by the state which means it's backed by unlimited funds.
804 2018-06-07 22:06:33 You're comparing needing an oil change to needing life-saving medicine or emergency surgery...
805 2018-06-07 22:06:17 @AFrith8 this kid is good. One for the future, along with oil Stone if he can get and stay fit
806 2018-06-07 22:06:02 I don’t think strains matter as much as the industry would like you to think. I suggest strains w THC 15-20%. Dosing is key 5-20mg usually works w average of 10mg. Much lower than stoners think. Also vape over smoke and flower not oil. HTH. Lmk if you have more questions

817 2018-06-07 22:04:16 That may be so, but the idea that billions of dollars are being squandered worldwide by tens of thousands of geologists, many of them working in the oil industry, strains credibility to the limit.

827 2018-06-07 22:02:19 I hope things improve for you and your country. The corruption is staggering in an oil rich country.

829 2018-06-07 22:02:13 My guess is that you have to have someone else mess up their kitchen to love them at first site.

(sort of like french fries.  If you like them, you had good ones long before you made them yourself.)

But yeah, peanut oil (that doesn't smell like peanuts) is always good.

836 2018-06-07 22:00:36 Wtf why would you give this person a platform? The person doesn't understand the difference between alternative medicine (acupuncture, medical marijuana, etc) and homeopathy. Homeopathy requires that there is not enough active ingredient for it be effective. It's all snake oil.

843 2018-06-07 21:59:37 Venezuela, goes to show how clueless you are about economics. Venezuela has a wealth of oil on which it based its economy, - oil prices collapsed. Now would do you think would happen if oil prices quintupled in this country.. Ooops bye bye economy.

845 2018-06-07 21:59:18 I honestly wish I did it myself but I only know the basics (changing tires, oil changes..etc). Also, I got off at 5, car shut down at 6 and AAA didn't get to me until 8. By then all the shops were closed except a few and they took it to an expensive ass spot.

859 2018-06-07 21:57:25 That is the hope! I am sure it will be, I don't eat fried food as it is because of too much oil. So a close approximation will be good enough. :)

863 2018-06-07 21:57:03 Improve your diet and eat more protein-rich foods. More vitamins, minerals, sleeping for at least 7 hours, drinking plenty of water and reducing stress can also help. Quality beard oil will also help you in growing a healthier beard. But it all comes down to genes in the end.
864 2018-06-07 21:57:02 They prosper because of oil and not due to relations with Israel.
865 2018-06-07 21:56:58 You are dumber than a box of rocks!   CA just increased their gas taxes, not the FED!   USA is exporting more oil today than ever before which is great for America and brings in more USA revenue!

867 2018-06-07 21:56:35 @CNBCFastMoney My Dad was an oil CEO in the days when they were NOT traded like pro athletes. When someone is paid millions a year I want updates. If a company wants to be traded value stock, then don’t bother with 1/4. Let me use the data as I will!
868 2018-06-07 21:56:30 Also: the radio guy's comparison to oil seemed very wrong.

Yes releasing gases from oil from underground into the atmosphere causes problems.

But turning forest and bush into grass is pretty much the same!

918 2018-06-07 21:49:09 On a global scale, the impact of a single oil sands pipeline or +/- oil sands output changes are small.  I prefer to work towards broader policies (carbon pricing, etc) which, if implemented globally, would make a much bigger difference than blocking a pipeline.

964 2018-06-07 21:43:08 And yes, I would not trust anything that is advertised online. Scammers. Leafly will tell you the exact percentages of everything available. Those online oils look very sketchy. Also. Oil doesn’t really work with nerve pain, in my experience Not to dissuade or bum you out...

968 2018-06-07 21:42:25 And in places like where I live, that is an absolute non-starter, especially considering the number of people in Canada and worldwide that put food on the table because of oil, this road will be difficult. Where do you start with that though?
969 2018-06-07 21:42:17 I remember this woman laughed and said: I can’t believe you really got special shampoo and oil to take care of your beard. Forgive me for not wanting to be a crusty face man

Palm oil is vegan too, so that’s not really the point. Meat and dairy just contribute to ocean dead zones and take up a lot of space for feed.

999 2018-06-07 21:39:34 Are you kidding me? EU cannot use  Euro to buy oil from Iran?
1000 2018-06-07 21:39:20 No, because you can't win arguments by being reasonable. We're emotional. I need to argue from emotions. And you first need to believe that oil addiction is making our children and our planet sick, and it is a moral decision.
1001 2018-06-07 21:39:17 Actually our sanctions are pretty effective. We lock them out of the dollar currency market so they can’t trade and we  don’t allow any US companies to do business with companies that do business with Iran.  That means nobody buys their oil.

1008 2018-06-07 21:38:20 Okay so I’ve been using African Shea butter and coconut oil in my hair for the past few days and when I say YES GIRL I mean that shit

1011 2018-06-07 21:38:07 Hi Mr. Schoeniger, I am not sure if you remember me but this is the vision I was telling you about of the ice house oil painting as it was created. There's even the truck of crowded people in the distance. I hope that you like it. It's a 30×40

1017 2018-06-07 21:36:51 I’m against special privileges granted by government in all forms, including oil companies. People can’t complain there needs to be more government oversight and act shocked when they collude with big business. Can’t have it both ways. Need to separate the two.
1018 2018-06-07 21:36:42 I love getting my oil changed and being asked if they can add $150 additional to my bill for things I don’t need. 
1019 2018-06-07 21:36:39 I completely switched to organic skincare. Oil cleansed with olive oil and almond oil, then African black soap, toner with witch hazel, tea tree and a teaspoon of ACV. Used a few serums like vitamin C. Moisturiser with shea and aloe Vera gel
1020 2018-06-07 21:36:38 Use salicylic acid. Salicylic acid is the best ingredient for penetrating the pore lining and helping to keep it clean. It’s a keratolytic beta hydroxy acid (BHA) famous for its ability to smooth the skin without causing irritation and reduce acne- causing bacteria and oil
1021 2018-06-07 21:36:24 Work with steam, when your working on your pores, opening them up with steam first. The heat the steam provides will raise the temperature of your skin softening the hardened oil in the pores for deep cleansing
1022 2018-06-07 21:36:15 Not fans them Anthony & you know that. 
Those people are the same type of person who started supporting you when you stopped getting bankrolled by toilet paper & started getting funded by oil.

1037 2018-06-07 21:33:52 “NATO will not defend this illegitimate Zionist entity from the [Russian] bear.”
This is important because it means control of the Saudi oil, the mainstay of the petrodollar, has fallen out of Zionist hands, the sources say.

1042 2018-06-07 21:32:43 Palm oil is used for a reason—it’s the most efficient. Switching to other oils will just transfer the pain elsewhere. We need to boycott reckless agriculture and industry in all of its forms, while overturning the system that keeps those corporations in power.
1043 2018-06-07 21:32:37 the other day i had a middle class meltdown and cried because the oil from my artichoke heart antipasti spilt on my dried porcini mushrooms and my baby sweet corn
1044 2018-06-07 21:32:27 You mean it's inappropriate to lie about said national security concern & offer no excuse other than the War of 1812? 

Considering Canada is the single greatest outside supplier of oil to the US, you probably have a bit of leverage...

1046 2018-06-07 21:32:08 I think that you, like most people, are being unreasonable in your vehicular expectations. An ultra-reliable car (no oil changes!) with a range of 380kms between charges is more than enough for just about anyone.
1047 2018-06-07 21:31:10 But you equivocated energy producers whose aim it is to make life better and who provide jobs with those who only produce addictive and lethal products. I doubt that the fatality rate for say working oil as compared with smoking cigarettes is even in the same ballpark.
1048 2018-06-07 21:31:07 So Donnie John  how much are you willing to pay for our oil and  Columbia River water (it starts in our  country you know). To begin we double the price  immediately.

1052 2018-06-07 21:30:40 I don't understand how I sprayed this room with insecticide in the morning and it is smelling of palm oil inthe evening.
1053 2018-06-07 21:30:40 Because Oil is now not your fantasy renewables #theleftisretarded
1054 2018-06-07 21:30:32 Not just palm oil. Meat and dairy are by far the worse of them all.
1055 2018-06-07 21:30:24 Look up Standing Rock last year. You wouldn’t hear of it because Oil companies are an extension of the feds. Go check your facts before telling me I’m wrong. Opinions are one thing ignorance is another. Endorsement by denial is just as bad as police brutality.

1060 2018-06-07 21:30:18 Netanyahu and his Gov should be in the Hague defending themselves on the charge of "crimes against humanity". If any other leader had committed these crimes the West would be up in arms and if oil was involved invade the country spouting "regime change". Has that happened before?

1062 2018-06-07 21:30:05 Took my car to get an oil change. 
390 dollars later and my car is still a POS
1063 2018-06-07 21:29:54 I think that was the outcome he was hoping for. As long as it’s not hurting the oil industry he’s okay with it.
1064 2018-06-07 21:29:42 Clearly never cured your own bacon then robert? ...the "special stuff" is like crack, best watch a few documentaries on, sugar, food oil bleaching processes, palm oil, battery farms deodorant use of aluminium.. then melt down
1065 2018-06-07 21:29:36 "Russia's oil and natural gas industry is a key component of Russia's economy, with revenues from oil and natural gas activities—including exports—making up 36% of Russia's federal budget revenues."

Anyone want to hire an experienced video editor who works too much for too little? ;)
1071 2018-06-07 21:28:51 nothings wrong with that. we are literally agreed. the real substance of the discussion should be the T&C's. weve always proposed that oil revenues are shared in a way that guarantees a small centre, local governance, and social equity in basic income and assets. plain and simple
1072 2018-06-07 21:28:46 Waited till my jeep was at 1% to do the oil change and got a lecture

1139 2018-06-07 21:20:06 Ugh I'm sorry :-(    smoke weed!  Cannabis oil.   Its cheaper than your meds.
1140 2018-06-07 21:19:54 Honestly it doesn't matter what your point is when the KM expansion should have stopped right away. Its an environmental disaster in order for China to get more oil. We should be building refineries so we can clean our dirty oil so it can be sold at full price, not discounted
1141 2018-06-07 21:19:47 The stupid, it burns... but in a crazy way helps oil / coal / rosneft
1142 2018-06-07 21:19:35 Curious how micro mobility gets attention/critique when oil subsidies of $4b rerouted to transit would mean doubling New Starts, or HWTF and automaker bailouts amounting to more than all of Amtrak's operating subsidies Ever
1143 2018-06-07 21:19:29 I saw guy that works oil and gas industry post that said 7 people hurt on wtov9 fb page comments and that they was taken to PA burn center.
1144 2018-06-07 21:19:29 I agree with sugar. Not too sure about bread and oil.
1145 2018-06-07 21:19:25 Steals an idea from other students while at Harvard, cheats his partners, takes the data and sells it, and has no security over it.  Makes billions.  But because he looks like Data and has no social skills, is considered less "dangerous" than an oil exec.

1148 2018-06-07 21:18:52 @MaisarahMahmud Hi, kak mai. Saya confused. Haritu saya baca thread kak mai yg double cleansing good for all skin cth mcm biore cleansing oil & so on. But baru² ni tak silap , saya baca yang kak mai mention produk tu agak tk sesuai utk muka yg terlalu oily. Mcm mana ni ye?Tak fhm
1149 2018-06-07 21:18:49 Not all #MCT oil is created equal and unfortunately it's usually NOT differentiated on labels. For example C8:0 Caprylic Acid is superior for #nutritionalketosis compared to the cheaper C12:0 Lauric Acid. This matters when you're on a #keto diet. Read labels or call the company.
1150 2018-06-07 21:18:40 I think it's great that he's willing to push for policies that will probably hurt him financially, yes?  Wish more pols would put values over dollars. In the interest of full disclosure, I own shares of an oil company, but can't wait until we're all electric and charged by solar.
1151 2018-06-07 21:18:39 I did the caster oil, but only do it if you're already dialated!
1152 2018-06-07 21:18:24 Someone gotta oil him up 
1153 2018-06-07 21:18:14 Ahhhhh sorry nau
1154 2018-06-07 21:18:12 It's an embarrassment to the field of medicine. He went from being a cardiothoracic surgeon to advertising and selling snake oil to the highest bidder. 

It's gross.
1155 2018-06-07 21:18:05 Huh? he must sell snake oil also!
1156 2018-06-07 21:17:50 May I ask what you and your US supporters are doing about US oil exports? Or the 600,000 barrels a day Canada imports from Various countries?
1157 2018-06-07 21:17:47 That was I, but I figured you would set thing right... I said savant because the guy has a talent. He can sell snake oil. And yes, I wish this adm was a bad memory already. It isn't yet
1158 2018-06-07 21:17:47 nah, he looks like the dude that always puts oil in his hair
1159 2018-06-07 21:17:43 Similarly, your Turkish mum who didn't whip out the yogurt or olive oil for every cut or sunburn never was your mum
1160 2018-06-07 21:17:32 We have quite a series of strange new oil company names: Andeavor (Tesoro), Equinor (statoil), Nayara Energy (Essar Oil). I'm lost!

1162 2018-06-07 21:17:25 Whoever changed the oil last tightened the drain plug too tight apparently and they wanted to drive a hole through it... no thanks
1163 2018-06-07 21:17:22 It's like trying to dig for oil in your backyard, it's very unlikely that it will work, but if it does you're fucking rich.
1164 2018-06-07 21:17:22 it just doesn't motivate women as it does men, and then if women have to be forced being a programmer on a computer in an oil rig installation (:P), they would live a lie. Just like you can't force men to become nurse, and that doesn't mean they are apathic or something..
1165 2018-06-07 21:17:18 Skepticism is a virtue, not foolhardiness.
It stops one from giving money to con men, snake oil salesmen, and Nigerian Princes. It clears one’s mind from believing wild, unsubstantiated claims.
It keeps one safe from being taken advantage of. 
It’s the opposite of gullibility.

1169 2018-06-07 21:16:25 My car broke down because I forgot to get an oil change.. do you want to get taxed a little bit more so I can get Universal Auto Care?
1170 2018-06-07 21:16:20 Bad oil leak. Needed new shocks and strutss. Living in the city. More of a hassle than anything. Did 10 years of service.

1183 2018-06-07 21:14:43 And the snake oil salesmen tweets
1184 2018-06-07 21:14:37 His numbers are still 37 to 40. I'm not concerned about his numbers going up. He has cost us more in gas, oil, food, all the tarrifs bestowed upon us, he just cut funds to VA and now NK. His followers will continue to be racists. We can't really change that aspect.

1190 2018-06-07 21:14:08 I saw a video where someone used coconut oil!
1191 2018-06-07 21:14:08 And then 10 years later after 2000 Americans were murdered by Saudi terrorists, we invaded Iraq under the guise of WMD's to make GWB's oil buddies richer. 

But let's say they didn't invade the 2nd time for oil - why didn't GWB go after the country the terrrorists came from?
1192 2018-06-07 21:13:43 Added lemon and grapefruit essential oil to the chocolates. Will enhance the sativa effects

EXODUS 30:31-33
1203 2018-06-07 21:12:44 Totally agree!! But for many, "failure" is apportioned on a personal level NEVER about management capability or responsibility. The resulting burnout, staff turnover & job dissatisfaction is hardly surprising. Changing work culture is like steering an oil tanker but is crucial!
1204 2018-06-07 21:12:08 Medium Chain Triglycerides. The good omegas which come from coconut oil.
1205 2018-06-07 21:12:06 Dear Gawd. When we were teens, we'd soak ourselves in Johnson's baby oil to enhance the rays!
1206 2018-06-07 21:12:00 I no longer burden myself with all these stuffs on here,I just forge ahead with my set goal.
1207 2018-06-07 21:11:56 Why did I even find this funny idek
1208 2018-06-07 21:11:55 No negativity here lol I'm just saying it's sooooo much easier to get parts & such for it. The only weird thing about it is the oil filter but that a simple thing fi get
1209 2018-06-07 21:11:55 I have a cool magic trick: sit outside covered in tanning oil in UV Index 7, for three hours and STILL  NOT  TAN. Or burn, for that matter. 

Pale forever.
1210 2018-06-07 21:11:49 i just tried the new too face peachy matte primer and i’ll do my foundation concealer bake my under eyes w the too faced peachy powder & the ill blot over that with the fenty blotting powder it’s actually been helping hold my oil a little bit

1212 2018-06-07 21:11:45 @NutellaGlobal when are you guys gonna stop using palm oil? There’s a thousands alternatives for that. Why choosing one that affects animals and their habitat?
1213 2018-06-07 21:11:36 If you are seeking clean water... you might want to start stocking up NOW! Pruitt is hiding the facts about the safety of our water!
My wild guess... safe water will be similar to the oil striking days of old.
1214 2018-06-07 21:11:36 Truer words... I need to buy some snake oil anti-aging creams later.
1215 2018-06-07 21:11:34 It felt like it took me a thousand years to finish  i used a photo of a girl I found on Pinterest and stylised her face a little more :) I only really used like 2 brushes to actually paint everything! The hard round brush and a textured oil brush!
1216 2018-06-07 21:11:32 What the hell is the point of making an appointment for something that takes 30 minutes if you aren’t going to get to it at the scheduled time? It’s a freakin oil change it shouldn’t take an hour and a half to get to it and do it.....
1217 2018-06-07 21:11:31 Figures are wrong though. £230m, which is a staggering investment for us. The whole Neymar thing has moved the fees up so much. As nice as it is to be keeping up with the joneses, we aren’t owned by an oil well.
1218 2018-06-07 21:11:26 Ocean’s 8 is apparently good so it will do well. Ghostbusters was a total turkey, the makers *knew* it was a total turkey, so they went all SJW to sell it. That’s the difference.

1234 2018-06-07 21:09:41 I remember when this used to happen to me. If you don't want to take pain killers, you can massage your scalp and temple areas with peppermint oil (mix with any oil you have); it works like magic.

1242 2018-06-07 21:08:42 Anyone with a brain, especially from NY, knew since the 80s what a snake oil salesman he is. Always was, always will be.

1258 2018-06-07 21:06:24 How do you feel about a grade schooler’s right not to be shredded? The two are not mutually exclusive...the cosplay part is the unwillingness to “suffer” some inconvenience to insure guns are the tool you describe AND as safe as possible.

1283 2018-06-07 21:03:01 This cbd oil is doing wonders for my back pain.
1284 2018-06-07 21:02:58 I use both the oil and a balm. I like results I’ve noticed.
1285 2018-06-07 21:02:54 Although effing the Iran deal pushed oil prices up a bit
1286 2018-06-07 21:02:49 I really enjoyed coconut oil for a good while, but then the taste got old for me.  My dad swears by it.  I give my dog teaspoons of it in her meals to give her coat a nice shine.  It also helps with her skin.

1288 2018-06-07 21:02:38 so I was changing hydraulic hoses at work and one of them still had pressure in them so when I broke the line loose it squirts oil all over me and all I hear is the old man I work with yell out "Money Shot, Daniel got the Money Shot!!" lmfao 
1289 2018-06-07 21:02:32 Ex.29 Instructions on CONSECRATION of the priests. I’ll do my best to summarize details. 
Ex.29:4-7 God told Moses to bring Aaron & his sons to entrance to the tent of meeting & WASH them w/water. CLOTHE Aaron w/the garments & ANOINT him by pouring the annointing oil on his head.
1290 2018-06-07 21:02:29 .@Juli8Bot Careful! You almost shot hot oil in my eye!

1293 2018-06-07 21:02:05 If you are saying that “to some the economy is bc of Trump,” thats a pretty horrible justification to say, well Trump associates the econ to take credit (wrong) so we will intentionally associate oil prices to Trump.
1294 2018-06-07 21:02:04 Thank you Rosie.. no more palm oil for me
1295 2018-06-07 21:01:56 MAKEUP QUESTION: to anyone who's tired the farsali oil; does mixing it with foundation make your face look dewy??
1296 2018-06-07 21:01:50 It was probably like earth until the inhabitants discovered oil, some of them became greedy and didn't want to share. Instead they tried to get more and more, killing anyone that got in the way, whole nations. Then one martyr let off an atomic bomb destroying everything. Bang

1303 2018-06-07 21:00:53 Yes let’s stick all the oil & gas tax revenues into a fund for a rainy day instead of using it to fund public services ... and lets tax everything else instead.... food, cars, alcohol. I’m sure all the raving Indy fanatics will be delighted to pay £10 for a pint down their local.
1304 2018-06-07 21:00:50 There has also been a massive failure of intellectually bankrupt "think" tanks influencing proceedings... the IEA being the very worst.

Legatum outed as a fraud and Snake Oil Singham acknowledged as a know-nothing muppet... snap him up!

Grimes the Criminal... get him onboard.
1305 2018-06-07 21:00:48 "It's been rear ended several times, suffers from leaks, but the oil was changed regularly, but it had a recent lube job and it's a real head turner on the street"

1310 2018-06-07 21:00:32 Hi Sam! What is the name of virgin oil that you use on face to make it dewey?
1311 2018-06-07 21:00:22 Coconut oil is very healthy. It is high in special fats called medium chain triglycerides, which are metabolized differently than other fats
1312 2018-06-07 21:00:07 June 07, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
1313 2018-06-07 21:00:01 Could not agree w/you more.  When she called him a "snake oil salesman" she was spot on.  Few cared then, but she was accurate.
1314 2018-06-07 21:00:00 The job seemed simple enough: oil up the abs, make a little cash on the side. Instead, reality TV burnout-turned-exotic dancer Russ “Studicus” Chambers ends up in ancient Rome, where he’ll have to save Julius Caesar with the power of pole dancing & 80s rock #PitMad #A #HA #TT #SF
1315 2018-06-07 20:59:59 It's chocolate that contains no palm oil or child slavery to make.
1316 2018-06-07 20:59:49 unexpectedly: imperceptibly illusive objects cause a chain reaction in a series of oil drums.  Most of these fast moving shapeshifters fly by with no detection, but these conspicuous muons create ions, causing confusion across the globe; hundreds more ion detections than we hoped
1317 2018-06-07 20:59:34 This is like dry humping?
1318 2018-06-07 20:59:31 LOL! Nice try, but the "Friends of Science" are a bunch of Conservative #climatechange denying bigots. Nothing you claim is fact. Protesters are not funded by "Offshore interests". The protesters have a right to stand up to big oil. #bcpoli #abpoli #StopKM #AlbertaBullies
1319 2018-06-07 20:59:17 No reason why an oil change and car wash just ran me that much , where’s the good males at in my life when needed
1320 2018-06-07 20:59:15 Shit, where’s my olive oil hair cream? Gotsta part-ay.

1331 2018-06-07 20:57:31 @HyundaiCanada what is the point of an oil warning sign if it doesn't work?
1332 2018-06-07 20:57:18 All the previous replies are great! Could also consider any of: green olives (with pimiento inside), chorizo, chicken offal, green peas, or start the oil with a sofrito

1334 2018-06-07 20:57:01 I studied by oil lamp. Loved it.
Had great teachers, though. They didn't  just sprout. These wonderful white ladies and gentlemen worked hard, studied hard and approached teaching as a calling.
Blacks had every opportunity to do the same. They couldn't or they wouldn't.
1335 2018-06-07 20:56:59 how many reminders is the dealership gna send about my oil change appt until the day of oil change appt

1337 2018-06-07 20:56:45 Mental gymnastics. Jesus never asked the woman to pour the oil. He never asked to be buried with the money. This is the difference

1339 2018-06-07 20:56:29 Hi #palm #oil is destroying the rainforests of #Borneo and killing #Orangutans in the process as well as other animals why not follow @redapes you can also adopt an Orangutan from them to make a difference to their lives', btw #palm is also unhealthy and is in much of our food
1340 2018-06-07 20:56:27 Ok.  I'm going to get oil change stuff before I come home
1341 2018-06-07 20:56:20 Currently writing a blog piece on heritage brewing, and it contains the line "it's like serving up Neck Oil instead of Advocaat"
1342 2018-06-07 20:56:13 I need a car wash and an oil change #urgently 
1343 2018-06-07 20:56:12 the turbos are identical. it's impossible to have a symmetric oil drain line because the drain bolt is offset to one side of the engine.
1344 2018-06-07 20:56:11 That’s it?! That’s all you got?! I guess you forgot about $4/gal.  I don’t like the increase in the cost of gas either. Thing is, America can afford it now. We are becoming oil and natural gas independent. That means those oil company employees that are doing well, are Americans.
1345 2018-06-07 20:56:01 time and time again I refuse to put on sunscreen and douse myself in sun tan oil and today it finally caught up w me & my chest is fried !!! (((((:
1346 2018-06-07 20:55:57 With out oil being pumped out of the ground. How would Ontario be the largest contributor to Canada’s GDP? Oh wait..

1351 2018-06-07 20:54:47 I have bought a few others too. I will taste all of them out with time.

Top sellers. I bought one that had a lab paper work. And purchased Johnny Apple CBD oil. Number 2 most seller and voted.

1354 2018-06-07 20:54:26 I so remember this show...Donald has been a snake oil salesman all his life. Hard to believe so many people buy his poison.
1355 2018-06-07 20:54:18 A shipment of elderflower scented beard oil is on it's way.
1356 2018-06-07 20:54:14 There was a tamper looking sorry for itself near Horley this morning, having emptied it's oil all over the track. Environment Agency had to get involved!
1357 2018-06-07 20:54:07 Let’s make a side bet. I bet oil sands production will be higher in 20 years than now. Takers?
1358 2018-06-07 20:53:56 Presidents have little to no effect on the oil market. This is ridiculous statement with no hope of a causal relationship. Be better, you have legitimate things to discuss instead of making it up as you go.
1359 2018-06-07 20:53:52 Well, if the dude is stupid enough to believe that there is a bright future in oil and the Alta oil patch, he probably should give the degree back.
1360 2018-06-07 20:53:52 You are a sycophant. I pay more for gas, oil and will pay more for goods now because of his idiotic tariff war. The promise you made was to the constitution not to some orange traitor.
1361 2018-06-07 20:53:36 What about the hemp oil does this help ?
1362 2018-06-07 20:53:33 That’s actually not true. But think of it this way: Imagine Congress filled w/ reps who answer to you, & not the Koch Bros. If Congress prioritized budgets for education, healthcare, nutrition, the planet & infrastructure - instead of military, oil & low taxes 4 corps & top 1%.
1363 2018-06-07 20:53:32 O dear, a peak oil believer,  we're in zero danger of running out of oil and gas
1364 2018-06-07 20:53:30 We are best in oil and gas services....

Financed Timothy Leary's drug research...

Owned the Gulf Oil Company...

Were chief sponsors of the Heritage Foundation...

Andrew Mellon was longest serving Treasury Secretary...

Food for further thought...
1368 2018-06-07 20:52:52  different oil, I guess
1369 2018-06-07 20:52:45 The arabs flooded the oil market to drive out the frackers. Oil went from $100/barrel to $20.
1370 2018-06-07 20:52:43 Set an appointment to get my brakes replaced and oil change at 3. My car is still chilling
1371 2018-06-07 20:52:18 Too much pollution in Russia? Go figure. Pushing oil, gas and coal and refusing to see renewable energy is the way of the future. Look at Sweedens model for garbage removal. Every country should be doing that!
1372 2018-06-07 20:52:02 You cant possible think Trump is to blame for rising oil prices . You have so many other things to stand on why choose something that any Pres has little to no effect on.
1373 2018-06-07 20:52:01 Hey Nancy Pants, there is no correlation between consumer gas prices and Oil & Gas Executives cashing in.... you need a statistics lesson....
1374 2018-06-07 20:51:53 all arising out of a misplaced fear of the natural animal fats we evolved on,  
which has led to the demand for palm oil to be used in processed foods wherever properties of animal fats would have been desirable.  :/

1379 2018-06-07 20:50:59 People really get liquid into their phones and don't do shit about it. Literally just opened the back of a phone and oil came out almost everywhere like what the fuck you dirty mother fuckers man
1380 2018-06-07 20:50:51 If you don’t like what oil companies do then don’t drive a car or buy food distributed by truckers. That’s how you can help the problem
1381 2018-06-07 20:50:45 That’s UKs failure and if you had read the link which you obviously haven’t read then that deficit is explained. How does a Oil rich nation for 44 Yrs end up debt. Mismanagement
1382 2018-06-07 20:50:27 All the legalised CBD oil doesn’t contain THC, which is the chemical that essentially gets you high when smoking weed. But some oils do contain it. To save any hassle, I wouldn’t bother 
1383 2018-06-07 20:50:19 And up from the ground came a bubbling crude ,oil that is, black gold Texas tea.
1384 2018-06-07 20:50:08 Most of that belongs to Wales. It's our north sea 'oil'.

1390 2018-06-07 20:49:41 Anytimeee! Try mixing it olive oil too and if u can sleep it off to give it more time (no joke) youll see the difference immediately 
1391 2018-06-07 20:49:26 Maybe try and stick with it for a while longer but if it gets worse then just dump it and try out products with no alcohol and that aren’t oil free! Like rosewater or rose hip oil !

1410 2018-06-07 20:47:49 How much THC is in the one you have? Technically any CBD oil with any amount of THC is illegal in the UK.
1411 2018-06-07 20:47:11 well get on to UK, USA governments to stop bombing the shit out of these people, so BP can get the oil, the Rothschilds get the bank to enslave the people in debt, & the war machine moves closer to Iran/Russia

1430 2018-06-07 20:44:05 Please explain why Canada should support money being spent on oil from countries with poorer environmental protection and human rights?
1431 2018-06-07 20:43:52 It no longer does. Only thing I've found to work is Turkish lemon oil

1433 2018-06-07 20:43:40 An oil change  that’s a first, Michael Jordan won 3 more rings after his almost 3 year retirement so I have faith
1434 2018-06-07 20:43:20 1) Right? Wouldn't have thought to do that!
2) Hail Merry stuff tends to be heavily based on coconut and coconut oil, so it's quite rich & heavy and very strong coconut taste. So, good if you like coconut.

1444 2018-06-07 20:42:01 That was true about the past. It is not true about the future. Oil and gas (not electrical) are fossil fuels. The burning of them is causing @climatechange. Humanity has a choice to make. We stop using them, or we stop existing. The sooner we stop,  the better.

1451 2018-06-07 20:41:43 So a lot of vegans are super anti or pro oil and so I’ve switched back and forth between being oil free and not caring but basically that oil is something that def contributes massively to cal intake

1469 2018-06-07 20:39:07 And those same oligarchs control much of the natural resources of Russia, including oil, asbestos, tungsten, etc., and to keep himself in their good graces, exports to America are a tool (there's no tariffs on Russia).

had a pretty great rig going but the damn oil immersion condenser burst. It leaks at a drip rate and as a result the cyclical dispersion of heat has slowly begun to decline. tell me fellas, should I get a new nutsack or fix this 1
1481 2018-06-07 20:37:42 Just got off phone w/another energy economist who described the design of Alberta's oil sands climate policy (Carbon Competitiveness Incentives) as "brilliant." To recap: conservative economists love CCI, oil sands co.s helped design CCI (and love it) but conservatives hate CCI.
1482 2018-06-07 20:37:34 Oil explorations come with huge environmental responsibilities.  We want to leave an environment that is liveable for children after us.

1512 2018-06-07 20:33:51 Aloe Vera gel is good for oily skin (1 cause of acne when your skin is producing too much oil and your pores clog) so you can use it. Shea butter can be used as a treatment to clear up any acne scars or discoloration. Since you have oily skin DO NOT use it as a moisturizer.

1556 2018-06-07 20:27:03 There’s no hate, if I were to put oil on myself and lay on the beach for hours, I would also be burnt to a crisp;)
1557 2018-06-07 20:26:50 Saw Glenn Hoddle down Bush Market Sunday selling snack oil
1558 2018-06-07 20:26:46 I may have over sprayed my car prior to my oil change in fear of this too
1559 2018-06-07 20:26:43 Good news! All the ballot propositions we supported won. And the terrible Prop 70 — a sneak attack by the Big Oil interests that dominate California politics — went down in flames. We were proud to play a role through our LA Forward voter guide, which reached tens of thousands.
1560 2018-06-07 20:26:31 My impression of a President is HE is the ONE person who listens to every person's voice in , not just those that tickle his ears and ego. But what do I know? I'm a Metis  whose Prime Minister wants to build oil pipelines through Indigenous land but won't lay water lines!
1561 2018-06-07 20:26:06 i was gonna text you! I have to figure out if i have to meet drew to give him his oil stuff he ordered so once i find out from him I’ll know if i can go! It’s at 8:30  and it’s just a 2 drink minimum purchase for anyone who goes!
1562 2018-06-07 20:26:05 You know I time travel! But as I last recall it was @hayley_brooke32 who initiated the oil
1563 2018-06-07 20:26:04 The Oklahoma Oil & Gas Industry wants Todd Lamb for governor. That should tell you everything you need to know.
1564 2018-06-07 20:25:56 That’s why the conclusions you’re drawing and assertions of “snake oil” and “confidence jobs” are not only wrong but insulting.
1565 2018-06-07 20:25:39 1 Turbo= 1 oil pressure/1 oil return + 1 coolant pressure/1 coolant return. No "Y" shortcuts. Plumb other side, 1 pressure is not enough GPM for 2. Also- "combustion blow by" is not the only pressure in the crankcase;
1566 2018-06-07 20:25:37 How about a pipeline so we can price our oil equal to its worth? (Like mexico).
1567 2018-06-07 20:25:32 كنت أسوي جل الصبار فترة وما حسيت بفرق فصرت لما أخوز المسكرا دايركت أدهنهم بزيت زيتون هم وحواجبي وبليل قبل ما أنام أول شيء أسوي كحل طبيعي كذا مال أحجار ماعرف ويش أمي عاطتني ياه بس فنان حال الرموش والعين بشكل عام وأسويلهم فازلين و E oil بعده وهذا يوميا طبعا

1572 2018-06-07 20:25:02 @CharlesTrippy   Hey im writing an essay on cbd oil i want to ask how it impacts you and  how do you know It is doing its job ? Who suggested it to you
1573 2018-06-07 20:24:58 Experts , really when it comes to the oil market ? The price of gasoline on national average was $3.00 when announced out of Iran deal, now it is $ 2.94, hmmmm
1574 2018-06-07 20:24:49 #Graze's fries are made from fresh cut Kennebec potatoes, twice-fried Belgian-style in Non-GMO rice bran oil and seasoned with kosher salt.
1575 2018-06-07 20:24:46 When you know better, you do better. I can’t stand any forms of exploitation, human or animal. Veganism is part of being consistent, along with shunning palm oil, Californian almonds, products of slave labour and other unethical practices that harm species.
1576 2018-06-07 20:24:41 Sip so much oil think it’s fuckin up my kidney
1577 2018-06-07 20:24:17 I am in total disagreement with Sec. Pompeo. There's not a hint of honesty in Kim Jong UN. Nothing but a snake oil salesmen.
1578 2018-06-07 20:24:05 Stop raininggggg I need to do an oil change on my car 
1579 2018-06-07 20:24:05 Salvaged my dry matte lipstick by adding coconut oil #lifehack
1580 2018-06-07 20:23:46 Not unless I'm the one driving. Then I'm ok or if I'm a passenger I can sleep and be ok. I do have peppermint essential oil that I can sniff and that helps a lot too. The older I have gotten the better it is, just not sure about on a boat since I've never been on  big boat b4 lol
1581 2018-06-07 20:23:45 اللهم انِك عفِو كريم  تحِب العفو فاعفُ عَنا.
1582 2018-06-07 20:23:38 No, they aren't.
1583 2018-06-07 20:23:22 Also, my essential oil game is pretty on point.
1584 2018-06-07 20:23:04 Thanks Delaney 
1585 2018-06-07 20:23:04 Do you need some coconut oil for that? I have plenty
1586 2018-06-07 20:23:04 power of the seed
The soil determines the power of the seed. You can have the most powerful seed in the world, you can be the most anointed speaker in the world, but if the soil you're planting the seed into does not want to receive your seed... Don't waste your oil!
1587 2018-06-07 20:23:03 If I start to talk.....
1588 2018-06-07 20:22:58 Lol the oil rigs again... It was so clearly a joke. Destiel wasn't even mentioned, only fanfiction in general. Also, whenever ANY character makes long eye contact, the writers write "eye f***", not just Deancas. And a high five don't mean much.
1589 2018-06-07 20:22:48 so if nigeria starts refining crude oil ba bye England. Simple as that I GUESS.
1590 2018-06-07 20:22:39 I didn’t know I needed to commit an entire afternoon to getting my oil changed at Walmart...
1591 2018-06-07 20:22:37 I want an oil diffuser thanks to Danie
1592 2018-06-07 20:22:35 Magnolia tissue oil seems popular in the responses. Will try it thank you
1593 2018-06-07 20:22:34 Energy has improved our life immensely & will continue to do so as it evolves - not an us against them situation. At one time we burned sticks & animal fat now have oil, gas, nuclear, electrical, etc. This will continue to evolve.

Our survival & growth is a result of energy.
1594 2018-06-07 20:22:34 Tax dollars should NEVER go to Oil/Gas.  Give us all a tax cut and stop the subsidies.  Let us all pay the /actual/ cost at the pump.
Maybe then we'll start seeing fewer massive SUVs on the roads.
1595 2018-06-07 20:22:30 Bhai furnace oil pay chalta hay nishat power plant. Ab agar koi reference milay to mujhe bhi btao.
1596 2018-06-07 20:22:28 Could well have been ex standard stock with brake rigging. Sarah Siddons had dollies too even after the 1991 overhaul so learnt the hard way how to pack it correctly but not overfill with oil.
1597 2018-06-07 20:22:26 CAPP Oil Money Greed Gas Pollution, great! So you are the ones that will take care of the environmental problems we have & that you have already created! Great!
1598 2018-06-07 20:22:24 It’s all fun in games to have a luxurious cars but when it comes to oil changes it’s bank breaking  I just paid $250 at Infiniti for a oil change 
1599 2018-06-07 20:22:17 Free helicopter rides...
1600 2018-06-07 20:22:16 How come all my makeup products that say “oil free” feel like they’re made form baby oil? @BillNye can you Bill Nye-Splain this to me?
1601 2018-06-07 20:22:10 @OliDavis currently watching SD. Yes, there is a lot of oil on that rose.
1602 2018-06-07 20:22:09 Oh no! I recommend lemsip, olbas oil and beige food. It’s what’s got me through this week and a cold!
1603 2018-06-07 20:22:02 When a new administration comes in half the gov buildings in DC will have the copper pipes stripped out and the local pawn shops will be bursting with marble statues and oil paintings.
1604 2018-06-07 20:21:51 ooof thank u so much when i wash it i always straighten it and then give it some waves! i moisturize with coconut oil and wash my hair with purple shampoo to keep the highlights looking bright
1605 2018-06-07 20:21:42 MY MUM USED TO PUT OLIVE OIL IN MY HAIR EVERY WEEK
1606 2018-06-07 20:21:37 About 51,000 if you include the rebates. I also will save about $15,000 in 5 years. And that’s not including the savings from oil changes, transmission oil changes and the fact that the brakes last a very long time on an EV because of regen brakes from the electric motor.
1607 2018-06-07 20:21:36 I'm thinking how long the GFA have been chopping our oil money when GNPC was their headline sponsor. Like by now @NAkufoAddo turn Kumasi to New York o. #Number12 #IamAnas
1608 2018-06-07 20:21:34 Good luck this weekend. Will be pulling for you from VLC @TXMotorSpeedway .

1611 2018-06-07 20:21:02 Oil Exchange & Lube beside Goodwill! 
1612 2018-06-07 20:21:00 They have soybean oil in almost everything they sell, I don’t get it
1613 2018-06-07 20:20:59 Lmao nah that’s why you ask that’s actually what we call a “muffin” it’s just hash oil but most of the consistency is propane once you purge the muffin it’ll look like the wax you see in the latter end of the process
1614 2018-06-07 20:20:58 My aunty tries to put oil in my hair all the time.
1615 2018-06-07 20:20:50 I miss paying $20 for a oil change these new cars sumn else
1616 2018-06-07 20:20:47 A few drops of lavender oil on the pillow help, and make sure you’re showering/eating/exercising a couple of hours before sleep as opposed to just before!!! Also make sure you’re talking about things with people so you’re not stressing out alone TOO much  xx
1617 2018-06-07 20:20:44 Long oil , short few things
1618 2018-06-07 20:20:43 يارب ما اندم إني لونتها ب oil colour

1620 2018-06-07 20:20:31 15 Reasons I voted Democrat. 1) It's best to pay BILLIONS for oil to ppl

1621 2018-06-07 20:20:29 Yes we have enough Oil to be Completely Independent but that is Congress Not Letting it go threw
1622 2018-06-07 20:20:26 Yeah, you get lost easy and it's huge as fuck. There are a lot of ambuses too lmao. Those assholes throw oil then fire too so you die 1 hit... BUT there is 1 worse area... So far
1623 2018-06-07 20:20:15 This going to end in tears,The EU will give a directive to ensure they know the provenance of all energy sources so they don’t fall afoul of the US treasury by legislating that all oil used in the EU must be quoted and paid for in Euros so they can track the entire chain.
1624 2018-06-07 20:19:58 Alberta: where political grudges are the only things that don’t die and turn into oil.
1625 2018-06-07 20:19:53 I honestly don't see motivation as an issue with Lucic...both last year and moving forward.
1626 2018-06-07 20:19:37 Hahaha, sell that oil to Bernie Sanders voters. GOOD LUCK.
1627 2018-06-07 20:19:29 how's that oil going
1628 2018-06-07 20:19:22 In December, I joined my colleagues to urge the Administration to invoke the Global Magnitsky Act & designate Roberto Rivas, President of the Supreme Electoral Council & Francisco Lopez, VP of ALBANISA, a tool of the Venezuelan regime that doles out oil to its puppets & allies.
1629 2018-06-07 20:19:19 Modern geographical Macedonia interests Skopians but also the USA who persuaded them about 30 years ago that they are the descendants of Great Alexander. Of course, the USA care is the oil underground Skopia and Greek Macedonia. The USA want later to unite the 2 parts in one.
1630 2018-06-07 20:19:17 My aunt and I continue our battle to have the family divest from oil and defense industries.
1631 2018-06-07 20:19:10 Babes, anyhow we slay just know there must be Yam, kolanut, dried fish and Red oil in our dowry list

1636 2018-06-07 20:18:56 What's this about the #DemocratTaxScam?

Hey, Nancy, you do know it's not just the oil companies, right?  It's also those Middle East countries you support.
1637 2018-06-07 20:18:23 This guy is really hung up on cosplay. I think he probably has anime posters on the walls in his Mom's basement.
1638 2018-06-07 20:18:06 Lotor looked away for a moment and his ears twitched. Pulling away from Keith he moved over to a chest of draws oil his room and opened the top one. Pulling out a small box he opened it up and looked through it.
1639 2018-06-07 20:17:36 You shouldn't buy any Palm oil products!
1640 2018-06-07 20:17:34 Wild Things dvd, baby oil, nine iron
1641 2018-06-07 20:17:28 Thank you for your response, but you deflect in it.

Any of those companies, clients associated with the hucksters of NT  crew, who are selling snake oil to obfuscate their decades of failures & selling out  for personal reasons?
1642 2018-06-07 20:17:24 The guy who said oil would never go up again is now long after a 100% rise in oil prices in a year.....
1643 2018-06-07 20:17:24 Really? You're pushing astrology now? That's a new low, even for the quack, snake oil salesmen that you are.
1644 2018-06-07 20:17:19 Funny but nodoby want to buy this high API oil... this week export at 1.7 million bar. (with a differential with BRENT exceeding 10 USD) shows that there is a problem of market (LTO is saturated) and quality. Wake up guys...
1645 2018-06-07 20:17:19 One step forward, two steps backwards! A typical NYC snake oil salesmen! His office provided nothing in the way of oversight at JHS13/Harlem! Under Jacob T. Michelman fiscal irregularities at JHS13 would have made Boss Tweed blush! School funds;in school sex
1646 2018-06-07 20:17:11 A snake oil salesmen who will sell out his own faith to get in good with a crook.    (There, I just saved you 5 min.)
1647 2018-06-07 20:17:10 my mom has organized a “birthday party” for me when i get to texas that is apparently just a front for a singles mixer because she has invited 10 random but eligible oil field workers and got a keg
1648 2018-06-07 20:17:02 Really bad analogy. Your chances are the same for both. Try again.
1649 2018-06-07 20:16:54 No, I just can’t be changing the oil on your car with something like that on lol
1650 2018-06-07 20:16:52 Chef Kawasaki cut up some acne, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was some  human flesh, along with sushi.
1651 2018-06-07 20:16:48 I’m really not trying to go to quick kar for a oil change

1653 2018-06-07 20:16:39 No, they are a good thing for the oil patch, but a terrible thing for the majority of hard working people
1654 2018-06-07 20:16:18 Most ppl don’t deserve to live the oil life,a real blessing
1655 2018-06-07 20:16:12 Coconut oil just gonna cook my shit when it get hot outside lol powder be everywhere and don’t got time for that

1657 2018-06-07 20:16:09 I didn’t know tea tree oil lightens skin. Now I have white spots on my face where my tan has faded 
1658 2018-06-07 20:15:59 why aren't we energy independent? We have enough oil to last us 200 years! I say stop financing the Middle East. They only use that money for terrorism. Make them bedouins again!
1659 2018-06-07 20:15:50 California, then Texas, and last year Florida filed similar litigation. We are behind. It's not hard pressed to find at oil(see what I did there). Guillory oil a supplier provided several small operators currently being affected. Including small operator closures. I think in many

1662 2018-06-07 20:15:43 False prophets and snake oil salesmen often have no trouble filling rooms with people eager to hear things that soothe their tribal hopes and fearful suspicions.

Next to Hannity and Alex Jones, Dinesh is perhaps the most disingenuous and deplorable pundit in the public sphere.

1668 2018-06-07 20:14:57 I’m sitting in a shop getting an oil changed and they have tennis on the TV and the moans and grunts that the players make are very uncomfortable
1669 2018-06-07 20:14:54 Ford is going to help the elites he claims to hate more than regular people. I don't understand why anyone buys his snake oil.

1691 2018-06-07 20:11:43 It's very, very true. We had a neighbour who had worked at the top of his field in the oil industry, now retired, who said he didn't know anyone who worked as many hours as we did. We get a bit more time off now. It has been 20 years though since starting our company
1692 2018-06-07 20:11:17 Castor oil. I even stopped using Jamaican Black. Also because I don't usually wear my Afro out. So the products I had were for styling. Really useless to me, so I gave them to people who actually style their fros
1693 2018-06-07 20:10:54 is that oil brand oil? i can't believe you're springing for that
1694 2018-06-07 20:10:40 I typed olive oil o br3da

1696 2018-06-07 20:10:34 Imma tell yo what cartoon never should have been on tv for children back in the day... Popeye. They had Bruno on there beating Olive Oil's ass every episode. It was really inappropriate

1708 2018-06-07 20:09:14 Stephen Crouch Midhurst walking dogs I think will locate the page. I did try "Red Cross (not really an aid worker) BBC, oil ventures Kurd Iraq war training" once but those pages have been deleted.

1710 2018-06-07 20:09:07 @jahanwilcox I have some old motor oil that I need to get rid of. Should I just dump it down the storm drain? I've been told that it will eventually end up in the Potomac, but regulations are stupid liberal lies so I know they're full of it
1711 2018-06-07 20:09:03 Two drops of Oil of Oregano at the back of the throat. Especially before bed. Yes it feels like the devil, but it's harmless.
1712 2018-06-07 20:09:00 Everything Rosie said then still holds true today. Snake oil salesman! #dumptruck
1713 2018-06-07 20:08:53 but not when you batter the shit out of it and fry it in terrible oil and serve it with horseshit chips
1714 2018-06-07 20:08:52 I read somewhere that the United Snakes get 60% of their oil from Africa. More than they do The Middle East. I see where all the payoffs are going to just freely take it.
1715 2018-06-07 20:08:47 I know imma regret having to wake up early for this oil change

1717 2018-06-07 20:08:33 Guerrero is a snake oil salesman. I’m willing to give trainers more of a benefit of the doubt. He lost that for me a long time ago.
1718 2018-06-07 20:08:32 Pruitt is defending oil oligarchs. Oil oligarchs keep GOP employed. Putin wants this. Therefore, no one with the power to do anything, does anything. Trump keeps master happy. Pruitt needs to be thrown out. Are there NO GOP willing to join the Dems? Is McConnell blocking again?

1720 2018-06-07 20:08:14 Muslims & West=Oil & H2O. Very few Muslim immigrants coming to Western countries immigrate into our culture.

1723 2018-06-07 20:08:08 I have relatives in TX who own oil wells and know the industry. They say the Japanese have been showing a great deal of interest the last few yrs.

Don't get me wrong - I'm quite certain that tRump has no idea what he's talking about -again. I just wanted to share what I do know.
1724 2018-06-07 20:08:06 @jahanwilcox I have some old cooking oil that I need to get rid of. Should I just dump into my municipal water system?

1726 2018-06-07 20:07:57 We should nationalize the oil companies imho
1727 2018-06-07 20:07:42 Crosscurrents. Dow up 90pts., the S&P, (2.2); Nasdaq, (54); Russell, (5.8)2.37.stocks, so we get a day of rest. Ten-year, 2.91%; crude oil, $65.97/bbl +$1.23; VIX up to 12.37.
1728 2018-06-07 20:07:34 I smell like a skunk that fell in a barrel of used motor oil.
1729 2018-06-07 20:07:27 If you think you have bad gaming takes, just remember that someone actually compared the snake oil that is the Atari VCS to the iPhone and calling said Atari VCS "innovative". And you wonder why the game industry never changes.
1730 2018-06-07 20:07:22 Not there cbd oil shop the one they do is crap

1740 2018-06-07 20:06:18 There must not be any oil or gas under those public lands.
1741 2018-06-07 20:06:17 They have a lot of oil that was kind of used well (enough) during the Chavez days. Now it's not. Venezuela is in a terrible place.
1742 2018-06-07 20:05:46 Heck yeah time to build some crackers
1743 2018-06-07 20:05:43 Marginal oil projects? With marginal cap structures?

1748 2018-06-07 20:04:54 How about putting a 25% tax on Western Union & wire transfers to Mexico since remittances are the largest source of income for Mexico surpassing oil
1749 2018-06-07 20:04:36 What causes oil barrels to ignite and extinguish by themselves? #DonkeyKongCountry
1750 2018-06-07 20:04:35 OK - I can’t see your report but I say we (the consumer) are getting screwed thanks to big oil collusion.
1751 2018-06-07 20:04:25 NASA won't admit it, but Curiosity just ran over an oil slick left by that secret 1960s Soviet diesel-powered rover.
1752 2018-06-07 20:04:22 When the economy booms so does demand for gas.  Cheap oil was closing our wells.  Higher prices mean those wells become financially sustainable again.  More Jobs for American oil workers.  It’s funny to me that Obama’s stats are missing.  $4.00 a gallon at one point in 2012.
1753 2018-06-07 20:04:15 Vaped CBD oil on my bike the whole way to Joes my dude

1762 2018-06-07 20:03:27 Their GDP is good because a lot of the nationalized industries are kind of working + they have a looot of oil. But pesa haifikii watu.

1764 2018-06-07 20:03:15 I try to only eat avocados olive oil and coconut oil for fats aside from whatever is in the meat I’m eating. I try to keep the fat low to minimize calories. So it’ll doing something more keto-esque

1766 2018-06-07 20:02:59 The employment rise is related to the gas and oil industry which Trump had nothing to do with. He's still fighting for coal, a dieing industry. Got rid of isis? Ha... not even close. But keep believing.

1774 2018-06-07 20:02:25 All the D without the men attached to it, apparently. It's like recommending fleshlights to gay men, or meat-like vegan food.
1775 2018-06-07 20:02:11 This should probably go without saying, but don’t stop your antidepressants because someone on instagram said they did with the help of CBD oil especially when they reply to all comments with a link where you can purchase said oil from them.
1776 2018-06-07 20:02:03 I think he must have had a blindfold on and constant life time stream of cash rolling in to his personal account from the oil companies 
1777 2018-06-07 20:02:01 Face, covered in oil..
1778 2018-06-07 20:02:00 That’s great! Maybe try some mct oil to up your good fats, too

1799 2018-06-07 19:59:26 Your hair is dead, the skin on your scalp is an organ. Our head is fine to get wet, as the oil protects it. It's the use of sulfates and alcohols that strip that protective oil off.
1800 2018-06-07 19:59:24 I just made it up. I grilled the corn and tomatoes on the stovetop with olive oil, salt, pepper. Then put in fridge til cold. Mixed with diced red onion, chopped basil, arugula. Topped with lemon and olive oil. Grilled halloumi on stovetop on a grill pan!

1823 2018-06-07 19:56:25 Well, let's see. First the earth cooled. And then the dinosaurs came, but they got too big and fat, so they all died and they turned into oil.

1832 2018-06-07 19:55:25 You will need to mix the cannabis with something or a vape such as an oil...now are you saying that is good for your lungs to inhale? What part of that don't you understand?
1833 2018-06-07 19:55:17 Just getting an oil change and taking lyft to pick my car up. These lyft drivers need additional training. This punk can’t drive for shit!!!
1834 2018-06-07 19:55:14 All actions raise oil price up to level needed for expanded USA shale oil production (and USA LNG shipments price level). If all of the above does not convince you USA's main driver is control of oil and petro-dollar, then keep on dreaming what ever you want, you are beyond help.
1835 2018-06-07 19:55:02 Just bought the fenty foundation. Damn that bitch matte af. Ain't no oil peeking through this mf.
1836 2018-06-07 19:55:00 They do but oil is not in their wheelhouse as far as I know. Manufacturing is, finance is & trade is but oil?
1837 2018-06-07 19:54:41 Instead of building a pipeline to carry oil, why not build pipeline to carry water to first nations ?

1841 2018-06-07 19:54:09 @NBCSportsGold so love the app great way to watch Lucas Oil Promotocross in UK
1842 2018-06-07 19:54:06 Agree.
Have to do some Kerry Gold butter when using coconut oil.  Just adds a rich taste.

1845 2018-06-07 19:53:54 he should just get some Chemours GenX or Fracking Oil
1846 2018-06-07 19:53:52 The flip-o-matic market... Rotate outa oil into tech, then rotate outa tech into oil, take retail up and down, ... rinse, lather, repeat
1847 2018-06-07 19:53:47 Guess what most of Americans disagree. Skyrocketing gas/oil. Medical is worse now than ever. Corrupt govt. No climate protection, hes dividing the country, shall I go on?
1848 2018-06-07 19:53:45 Undeserved! Suzuki has made a career out of propagandist advocacy. His personal carbon footprint belies his own words.He is a hypocrite of the worst kind, preying upon fears with manipulated facts. Canada needs the oil industry&ARE clean with its development, unlike imported oil.
1849 2018-06-07 19:53:44 any good primers that control oil ??
1850 2018-06-07 19:53:41 40 years ago + I learned that microbes will eat anything. They love oil & plastics which are very high energy sources.
1851 2018-06-07 19:53:35 Funny that the NDP hasn’t laid out its plan on how they plan on paying off the massive dept they’ve built up. Are you banking on $100/barrel oil? Oh I know, your HOPING to get re-elected then you’ll tell Albertans that your implementing a provincial sales tax
1852 2018-06-07 19:53:28 Or coconut oil.
1853 2018-06-07 19:53:28 #Lord, is Wall Street run by a bunch of ignorant greedy rich assholes?
The reason I ask
Americans wouldn't be pumping shit like #Retail because it doesn't make a damn thing...
It just moves $s.
Why ain't it pumping manufacturing, Oil, Natural Gas and that Made In America label.
1854 2018-06-07 19:53:11 Oil's Well salary man edition.
1855 2018-06-07 19:53:08 Actually Trump’s push for oil production is the thing that could lower gas prices. Make no mistake Pelosi is saying the opposite because GOP’s @TheRealJohnHCox was a winner in CA primary and is set to scold Newsom about CA gas tax increase in the general election.
1856 2018-06-07 19:53:00 Agree,it’s highly unlikely Lucic gets moved & that’s not a bad thing as I do believe Lucic will be extremely motivated to be better next season, if not it won’t be fun for him. If he’s traded he will be motivated even more to make Edm regret it

1861 2018-06-07 19:52:24 Even though the legitimacy of OPEC can be questioned, it doesn’t make economic sense for the US to sanction all of its member countries. There will be a negative response from the members and the grip on oil will be tighten. It could be like the oil crisis of 1973.

1865 2018-06-07 19:51:55 to limit production was designed to stay just bellow that line, making whole world fight USA in oil trade war. USA responded with ditching Iran deal and mainly-oil-focused Venezuela sanctions and additionaly forcing EU to ditch Nord Stream gas pipeline and investments in Russia.

1869 2018-06-07 19:51:17 woke up extra early today because I had to teach some third graders about oil spills for my science class and I asked them if they learned anything at the end and they all said no and now I think I need to cry a little and take a nap

1876 2018-06-07 19:50:26 And Iran now enriching uranium and raising the cost of oil. Thanks crazy-eyed jim jordan!
1877 2018-06-07 19:50:16 That depends on if you think I am a big beef eater. I'm sure chickens don't sure as much issues environmentally. As for environmental issues i'm sure palm oil and the shipping industry has a lot to answer for. Weren't Alpro bought out by one of the largest dairies Dean Foods?
1878 2018-06-07 19:50:15 That’s not oil, it’s sweat.

1880 2018-06-07 19:49:51 Yeah? my primary meals are stir fries with pepper/onion/broccoli/chicken, bit of chicken stock, olive oil, salt and garlic. Then throw in some noodles and fry it all together, add a little chunk of butter at the end. Only problem I guess is the noodles? Try not to have too many.
1881 2018-06-07 19:49:42 #NBSFrontLine am keen to know when the IGG will look into the oil agreements
1882 2018-06-07 19:49:31 Because distillate yield is lower from light shale oil, the shale growth will be curtailed or price differential will widen. Distillate inventory at below 2014 levels in US.

1899 2018-06-07 19:48:20 Sounds like oil and gas might even suffer, too.
1900 2018-06-07 19:48:12 Withdrawing from Iran deal was possible with assistance of Saudis.The world should not buy their oil to substitute Iran's illegal sanctions..let's stand firm against an outlaw & unethical US administration!#IranDeal
1901 2018-06-07 19:48:11 We know what he owed. We know he doesn’t pay his bills. 

We’ve also seen no taxes before or since. 

But you’ve been drinking snake oil for awhile now so impaired judgment happens. 

I’d recommend not stepping behind the wheel of a vehicle either.
1902 2018-06-07 19:48:02 Shoutout to the person playing turnpike here at the dealership as I’m waiting for my oil change 
1903 2018-06-07 19:48:01 Also important is that USA shale production needs WTI oil price at above $80 to be economicly viable. Iran joining unsanctioned oil market, overproduction arround the world and 2008 financial crises droped prices bellow that line, and recent deal few years back of OPEC/SA/Russia
1904 2018-06-07 19:47:58 "Eledumare" is coined from the yoruba concept of God, also an application in Yoruba traditional worship modes. All na religion, only one uses olive oil and tge other palm oil. We are all religious...
1905 2018-06-07 19:47:49 Ladies: best shaving advice I’ve received.... shave with olive oil!!! Sounds weird but when I tried it my skin has never been smoother (and I didn’t get any razor rash)!

1908 2018-06-07 19:47:23 Or Oil of Chick fil a. 
1909 2018-06-07 19:47:22 Lots of companies are now starting to use ethically produced or sustainable palm oil. It's worth reading more food labels to be sure. People voicing their concerns with their money will be the only thing to make others follow suit.

1911 2018-06-07 19:47:12 I've observed something. When I did my self ruqya and started on my herbal remedies (black seeds/oil, coconut oil, sidr honey, CBD oil) I was seizure free for 10 weeks. When I stopped and wasn't as strict with it, I've started having seizures again every 2 weeks hmm...

1917 2018-06-07 19:46:08 It was odd because Japan is not the first thing that comes to mind when I think oil
1918 2018-06-07 19:46:07 @CatherineBizTV On one hand Ian DeVerteuil criticizes Canada over pipelines, then praises Cdn.Oil Co., for gushing cash. Surprised you didn't pull him up on that! Doesn't make sense?
1919 2018-06-07 19:46:05 True.  

And also the new leaders in coal. And Oil. And gas.  

China has an all of the above approach.  Very sensible. 

Canada is also a world leader in renewables and hydrocarbons both.

1921 2018-06-07 19:45:47 Fox certainly IS watched by many. Which is part of the reason why people that claim to be "Christian" and " patriotic" support a traitor who has been nothing but a snake oil salesmen, ripping people off, for his entire life.

1926 2018-06-07 19:45:13 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
1927 2018-06-07 19:45:12 That’s not Obama taking sole credit, it’s both giving inaccurate points. Obama did cut permits, yet oil production increased greatly during his term. Large part is shale.
1928 2018-06-07 19:45:08 Mr.President...You are in the right side of history to stand for Iran deal and protesting against @realDonaldTrump policies..I suppose Europe should not buy Saudi's oil which is to substitute Iran in markets..a strong message to corrupts in gulf!
1929 2018-06-07 19:45:03 Right , bleach, pine sol and alil Murphy oil soap gets the job done 
1930 2018-06-07 19:45:00 Doesn’t matter anyway, oil companies have scalped every contract back and set rates for the next 3-5 years, so even if prices do rise further we won’t see much of it.
1931 2018-06-07 19:44:58 Don’t think he said that- but oil prices did climb, and drop, under Obama. And Bush. And Clinton. And... also, unemployment has an odd way or not caring who is president.

1935 2018-06-07 19:44:20 Dare I say, I think it's actually working. Oregano Oil seems to be keeping the sickness, whatever it may be, at bay.
1936 2018-06-07 19:44:09 Thanks very much. Is it CO2 extractions plus vegetable oil or another method/medium?

1942 2018-06-07 19:43:26 Some dish-soap companies advertise their products as good for the environment since they're used to clean birds in the wake of an oil spill. Where does much of the plastic used to make the soap bottles come from? Petroleum. So in a small way they're cleaning up their own mess.
1943 2018-06-07 19:43:21 Learning that Trump sought oil the day before his decision to withdraw from the Iran deal? Yeah... doesn't surprise me.

1947 2018-06-07 19:43:08 They will go extinct cus it wont stop palm oil companies will continue because people keep buying palm oil products.
1948 2018-06-07 19:43:05 Isn't that nice for both Russia and Iran. Obama's sanctions had chopped Iran's oil production in half and with low oil prices and their money devalued by half, Iran had been forced to talk.  They won't need to talk now, or is that part of the plan ???

1965 2018-06-07 19:39:34 Because without regulations, you don't know which medicines work and which don't, which are safe, and which aren't, why did people buy snake oil for centuries?

1967 2018-06-07 19:39:07 Do you understand that some people can’t roll spliffs at work, so the pen is wild discreet... You also get WAAAAYYY more smacked depending on the quality of the oil or wax
1968 2018-06-07 19:39:00 If they can’t discuss climate change or asbestos and are opening parks to oil companies, why the f do we have an EPA?
1969 2018-06-07 19:38:48 E don do
1970 2018-06-07 19:38:43 But the wealth fund that could have been started on the back of north sea oil in UK was wasted by Thatcher in keeping unemployment extremely high. We now give all spare money to the likes of Capita, G4S and other blood suckers
1971 2018-06-07 19:38:42 Love Beauty and Planet products are not all natural and organic. Each range includes organic coconut oil and is infused with a signature natural ingredient, such as murumuru butter. But, we use some ingredients that are not natural that ensure product safety and performance.
1972 2018-06-07 19:38:41 Tea tree oil nuh really gree wid my skin so this is a risk that I’m taking.
1973 2018-06-07 19:38:35 Abraj is facing claims from one of its creditors 100ml however PE companies r facing cash crunch on ME report  s showing down turn in deposits .... gcc hv to reinvent .... need to re-evaluate it’s business theory of war theory ...oil is king cash is gold .... rest bs
1974 2018-06-07 19:38:33 I’d suggest making your own thin crust pizza (ie make your own dough).  Half of one of my pizzas is an entirely reasonable 500 cals.  You’re 100% right about takeout pizza.  It’s made with way more oil and cheese than anyone needs.
1975 2018-06-07 19:38:32 #ElectricCars the other day @richardbranson suggested bringing forward full electric cars, nothing to do with making money!! How many others pushing stand to make LOTS of money?? Gas and oil power stations, turbines built with fossil fuel resources power lost in transmission.

What a peculiar combination.

1982 2018-06-07 19:37:32 however, I’d be in favor of bringing back the gas pumping gas attendants that would check oil/clean windshield.

1985 2018-06-07 19:37:25 So, I have natural super curly hair & I wanted to try drops of essential oils in my shampoo to promote healthy hair. Oh my goodness, after using 10 drops of tea tree oil, 10 of peppermint, & 10 of lavender, my hair felt super duper soft & shiny. What's your fave hair blend?

1987 2018-06-07 19:37:16 I should have said what's most intriguing about Statoil's new name, IMHO, is that... the three-letter word 'oil' got left out somehow
1988 2018-06-07 19:37:13 i just called to make an appointment for an oil change on my car & the guy laughed at me and said i didn't need an appointment it wasn't a nail salon :/ mean
1989 2018-06-07 19:37:07 My 2A right is NOT a cosplay fantasy. I used a firearm to save my own life one night. As a woman, no way in hell would I  ever give up my right to self defense! Why do you advocate for women & the elderly to become victims? You're either an idiot or an a$$hole. My guess is both.
1990 2018-06-07 19:36:56 I've studied statistics at a graduate level and use them on a regular basis.  I'm not sure that's where you want to go with trying to discredit me.  Again, look at worldwide trends, not pairwise comparisons.  I'm not sure what your talking about with UK vs Honduras.

2012 2018-06-07 19:35:02 It can be done much cheaper by using non conducting oil, where you put the data hardware in. The warmth in the oil can be re,-used.
2013 2018-06-07 19:34:54 What are the stats on law abiding citizens accidentally shooting an innocent? 324 mil people in US and 12k lives lost to guns.  Less than 1% and there are over 450mil guns in pvt homes, so if guns were the problem,  wouldn't our numbers be much higher?
2014 2018-06-07 19:34:45 Ask why Scotland requires the fabled 'fiscal transfer' being that we're the only nation to strike oil and get poorer?

2036 2018-06-07 19:31:43 This happened at our old house with a toad. We poured some water on him to rehydrate his skin (he was very dehydrated and sluggish), then used a bit of vegetable oil until he was able to wriggle the rest of his body through in the direction he started.

2059 2018-06-07 19:28:37 Why not Saudis?
Around 2009, Libya's Qaddafi started organizing African nations to create "golden African dinar" currency and sell oil EXCLUSEVLY in GOLD. He also financed Franche president Sarkozy's re-election campain with some 50 million EUR. Sarkozy is going to jail for it.
2060 2018-06-07 19:28:32 That's how auto/oil industry deals with anything that would cut their dominance and profits, by buying out and preventing development of ultra fuel-efficient vehicles. We could have cars that get 60mpg on just fuel (not hybrid), but this happens. Every time.

2069 2018-06-07 19:26:55 You have no clue. Our supply of crude oil is at the lowest since 2015 and it's all being exported out of the US.  Here's some facts for you, gov. facts. 2009 unemployment was 9.5, when Obama left office it was 4.8, it is now 3.8  You were saying?
2070 2018-06-07 19:26:42 EM CDS certainly should be Trading poorly. Though it is interesting why EM FX and Equiites are so weak with OIL a lot higher. Even for the Oil importers they usually benefit from Petro Usd re investment?
2071 2018-06-07 19:26:39 The best part about getting an oil change is getting free cookies and coffee in the waiting room
2072 2018-06-07 19:26:35 Doesn't that depend on current commodities spot-prices, particularly oil?
2073 2018-06-07 19:26:31 Yep, it's all about the brains now.  Soon the Mr. America competition will switch from Speedos and boxy oil to a business casual suit.

2081 2018-06-07 19:25:22 Only Norway would produce a TV drama based on the premise that a prime minister is concerned about climate change and would stop the production of oil and gas. Not bad Norway, not bad — watching Okkupert
2082 2018-06-07 19:25:09 Yes because Saudi Arabia is the only oil producer in the entire world........
2083 2018-06-07 19:24:46 Yes especially since in 2017 we exported more crude oil out of the US and our stockpile has dropped 10 weeks in a row. Towards the end of 2017 we shipped from 600 barrels a day up to 2,000 barrels a day. Our supply is the lowest since 2015.

2100 2018-06-07 19:22:49 Your need to feel good isn't actually a right. So that need can't infringe on a right.
2101 2018-06-07 19:22:18 I'm upset about this every single person on my face making me look like i just drank a bunch of vegetable oil
2102 2018-06-07 19:22:00 Nato used "Operation Gladio" to undermine anty-NATO govts, and even staged coup d'tat against De Gaul in "1968 student protests". Iraqs Saddam Hussein switched to exclusevly sell oil in EUR in 2000. After 19 Saudi Arabia nationals created 9/11in 2001, USA attacked Iraq? Why?

2110 2018-06-07 19:21:19 Kenya seems to have oil faster than it found common sense. It's hard to drill through all the substrata. You get over colonialism, you hit cronyism. Then soon after that you meet, a layer of sediment called tribal politics. The corruption hits you right at the next strata
2111 2018-06-07 19:21:16 Me: I'm going to start eating in every single day so I can be healthy and save money!!!

Also me: *Gathers a list of recipes that have a shit ton of butter/olive oil and expensive ingredients*
2112 2018-06-07 19:21:14 Now the goal behind cancelling the deal is obvious !! 
To rise oil price! 
Creating new crises! 
Making more arm deals!
2113 2018-06-07 19:21:08 Try lavender oil!

2116 2018-06-07 19:20:48 Like, I get it...  But why are you just going after @Disney?  It's making you look like @realDonaldTrump going after @amazon.  Why not go after the oil and coal companies as well. Coal & Oil worker's health insurance and pay? Love you Bern, but dude get the big fish!

2122 2018-06-07 19:20:02 @mightycarmods Can you guys do a dyno test on a car that is waaaaay overdue for an oil change, change the oil and dyno it again  to see the horsepower difference?
2123 2018-06-07 19:20:02 This is all part of the big picture of what Putin expected in return for helping the Trump campaign.   As oil prices skyrocket from Trump's destabilization of the middle east  Putin and his gang of thieves pocket more of Russia's oil revenues
2124 2018-06-07 19:19:55 I see your point, but we can't call it a "clear sign" unless you can prove or at least make a case for causality. Your explanations are very plausible, but how can you be confident that the price of oil wouldn't have risen regardless of the new tax laws?
2125 2018-06-07 19:19:49 Sellin it to an oil rag pal dont worry itl be nfl only soon fingers crossed
2126 2018-06-07 19:19:47 @DanRestoration Not spray. I wipe it on with a cloth then wipe it off again. Use as little as possible, nice thin coats. Follow instructions. I’m always careful with rags, oil and spontaneous combustion! Never had it happen with Osmo but it’s happened twice with Danish oil!
2127 2018-06-07 19:19:40 In all cultures Earth is refferd to as 'mother earth'. By your logic whole Earth is sacred, but we run , jump poop and pee on it. So we can do it any all part of Earth. Do you see the flw in your thinking now???

2133 2018-06-07 19:18:31 Loads of jobs depend on the oil market mechanics too - oil booms create a lot of petroleum engineering positions, but when busts come, R&D funding gets slashed, people are let go, and companies shed a lot of unnecessary weight.

It impacts a lot of lives more than some know.

2135 2018-06-07 19:18:20 No injuries, no damage (except to pipeline), no environmental crisis. Shit happens, Bill. Pipelines are the safest way to move oil and gas. Stop the bedwetting.
2136 2018-06-07 19:18:19 In case you don't notice prices .... gas and oil are up 30% above last year and groceries are up 40%.  The tax cuts that the average American got (if they got a cut at all) won't cover half of that.  Tariffs will push prices up even more, that's why GOP are fighting it.
2137 2018-06-07 19:18:12 Things that are wonderful:
- Locally-made spiced cider
- Sesame oil

2138 2018-06-07 19:18:04 Does not help when Democrats raise the tax in CA on gasoline, the state does not pump oil, does not process oil to gas and does not transport it to the gas stations but yet they get a bigger cut than the oil company the processors + that gas stations, tells you a lot right there
2139 2018-06-07 19:18:02 Not dragging oil and coal out of the earth, laid down over millions of years but burn’t in 100 is the best way to reduce climate change.
2140 2018-06-07 19:18:01 Brought my car to the dealership for an oil change. Mogs tried to tell me I needed two new tires cuz they found a nail in one... $400+. Brought the car to my regular tire spot and they found nothing wrong with the tire 
2141 2018-06-07 19:17:57 Nonetheless he and his like will win as long as progressive parties, universities, media etc tolerate and benefit from inequity and treat a high percentage of the population as disposable deplorables. They welcome snake oil salesmen & divisive demagogues if no one else listens.
2142 2018-06-07 19:17:45 My veggie pasta recipe: use Ronzoni SuperGreens pasta& Roma tomatoes. Boil water, place pasta in it. Slice tomatoes and put on baking tray. Cover in olive oil, spice with garlic & onion powder, basil & oregano,
bake 10 minutes…pasta in bowl, mix in tomatoes…done! no salt added.
2143 2018-06-07 19:17:45 Approximately 15 minutes. Kenney, like Harper and PC predecessors believe very much that higher education must be beholden to corporate interests.

Now Pruitt is handing out ethanol waivers like candy to his oil buddies, the trade war on the NAFTA front and the China front will put them down.
2149 2018-06-07 19:16:59 It really bugs me when people say naturopaths are all about sandalwood balm and non-GMO juice. We're not that simple. We also like oil pulling.

2161 2018-06-07 19:15:39 So, I got a bad oil change that is ultimately possibly going to cost me around $400. I’m here, at the place of business, asking that they correct their error. The owner of the place was immediately aggressive and trying to intimidate me-sorry bud, wrong girl to fuck with 
2162 2018-06-07 19:15:36 Omg we HATE the word like - as everybody uses it as over punctuation. We would rather be boiled alive in oil than use the word!
2163 2018-06-07 19:15:35 And if Jonathan and his administration had the brains to save as much as possible profits from the oil windfall, things might have being much better than this...
2164 2018-06-07 19:15:33 this is a sign of the strong-arm tactics to come. #crudeau would sooner turn British Columbia into a war zone full of armed masked military protecting an oil pipeline than concede that his ill-conceived project & all the money he's throwing at it is a dismal failure in leadership
2165 2018-06-07 19:15:32 So if Japanese/foreign cars are a "national threat" does that mean we must only drive inferior American gas guzzlers? Sounds very convenient to the greedy oil companies that lobby Washington.

2171 2018-06-07 19:14:51 @LateRoundQB people are required to back into parking spaces at places where an accident/emergency could happen (like an oil refinery) - this allows everyone to leave the lot faster when time is critical.
2172 2018-06-07 19:14:43 Standard procedure mate and if she’s runs out of tanning oil she can use the chip fat.
2173 2018-06-07 19:14:27 It is. And clear minds are required. When did the excesses of financial clout that likes of Sky bring not serve to cloud the mind? Isn't it why we've sold our oil, forestry, seaweed etc. We can lead. We must reduce commercial influence in significant cultural decisions.
2174 2018-06-07 19:14:27 Yet there's no talk about it or statements made on why its rising. Oil market manipulation is one of the oldest tricks in the book. Give it a few months, once it hits 4, Trump will say one word, drop it immediately and get all the praise. SMH
2175 2018-06-07 19:14:01 Sounds like somebody wants yet another tax. The oil companies will pass the cost down to the pump where it will cost more to produce and ship goods like food and clothing. The working person will pay more for transportation and we will all loose in the long run. No thankyou.

2206 2018-06-07 19:10:33 Nancy Pelosi you seem to forget when Obama was President, gas was over $3.00 per gallon.  The highest ever, and even higher in your state, CA.  That's the reason Trump wants to make America self sufficient and produce our own oil so we're not dependent on foreign oil.

2221 2018-06-07 19:08:19 This is why I avoid Palm Oil when I can.
2222 2018-06-07 19:08:18 So is one to conclude that only people who support Alberta's oil industry are worthy of honorary degrees from the UofA ? Frankly this entire story is rather sad in the context of what universities are supposed to represent, which is much broader than  one specific industry.
2223 2018-06-07 19:08:12 You can do this as many times a week as you like, but to maintain your hair I would say at least once a week. Also NOTE coconut oil is indead oil and will make your hair extremely greasy if you don't wash out all the way.

2225 2018-06-07 19:07:52 A nurse & pet owner told me the "urinary formula" canned cat food has more water, salt, fat, & oil in it than the usual kind, but otherwise not that different. It's not medicated? Going to look into this- possibly home cooking for the cat might save $$. Anyone have info to share?
2226 2018-06-07 19:07:36 If someone tells you to use Apple cider vinegar, lemon juice, sugar, or coconut oil as a home remedy... don’t trust that bitch.
2227 2018-06-07 19:07:32 I should say could be on the Iran thing. Depends on who you ask. Its gonna affect oil prices and thats Russias main export.
2228 2018-06-07 19:07:27 The money from the oil is sent to the feds, who distribute it to the provinces, at the end of the day money generated from the oil industry has benefited all the provinces in the country no matter how it gets filtered down to them!
2229 2018-06-07 19:07:19 Again, taking raw numbers without perspective leads to no valid conclusion.
2230 2018-06-07 19:07:18 Things that help grow your eyebrow. 

•Olive Oil : Moisturizes Hair
•Vaseline : Helps hair grow and keeps them in place 
•Castor Oil : Helps hair grow 
•Coconut Oil : Makes hair grow, gives it a natural shine 
These things can also help your hair as well 
2231 2018-06-07 19:07:00 Baby, at this rate they might be using cooking oil from Canaan and it must have been built using the remains from the tower of Babel or Noah's ark 
2232 2018-06-07 19:06:35 Do you know what happens when you try to mix cooking oil with water? 

It doesn't mix. 

And that makes me very disappointed.
2233 2018-06-07 19:06:35 You just blew up your own argument there.

You'll have to say what the threshhold level of Ebola virus is required for infection. Above that threshhold, you're in trouble.

2236 2018-06-07 19:06:14 Why are you embarrassed? Feel sorry for the guy, ignorance is not a reason for embarrasment, but a beginning, or a chance to educate the man. Harsh words only irritate and cause pain, but a kind word is like fine oil poured over ones body and teaches.
2237 2018-06-07 19:06:13 I just want to know if my Mercedes 240D will run on them, like it runs on cooking oil.

2242 2018-06-07 19:05:17 O/N Wrap:
Soooo boring - global equities mildly lower and US data mildly favourable; NZD numbers appear to be painted on the screen; big swings in oil (Brent +2.65%), but the market doesn't seem to care.
2243 2018-06-07 19:05:14 Maybe oil doesn't pullback as far as the bottom of the pattern. I wouldn't  jumping ship over a 45 cent move
2244 2018-06-07 19:05:13 Crude oil failed to hold on to its earlier momentum from April and May. Russia and OPEC will quickly fill the gap left by the expected production decrease in Iran, so there should be no significant reduction in global production. #dailynews #oil #Russia #OPEC #Iran #futures

2255 2018-06-07 19:03:30 Wow! What a breakthrough thought!!! I would have never guessed our dependence on oil had to do with our main mode of transportation being dependent on fuel.

2285 2018-06-07 19:00:03 I didn't read the study, but I have found they generally are biased to those that pay for it. :) With that said, all I know is there will be a leak at some point. No valid plan for cleanup. We essentially have junk oil, and its currently...
2286 2018-06-07 19:00:02 I use combination of udos choice oil which is an organic seed oil with omega 3,6&9 (vegan) plus feroglobin liquid which has iron, all b vits plus a range of other vits&minerals.  This is vegetarian friendly but not vegan.  I think they do a vegan friendly similar product though.
2287 2018-06-07 19:00:02 How is this fool allowed to continue this behavior? Get the coal and oil machines out of #MobstaDonny’s,Pruitt, and Zinke’spockets and get rid of the whole lot!

2289 2018-06-07 18:59:52 Trump was only pissed bc he knew (like many of us) that Rosie was right. Snake oil salesman could not be a better description of the man who conned millions.
2290 2018-06-07 18:59:27 Too right. Truffle oil is best on cottage potatoes. Adding shallots makes it even better.
2291 2018-06-07 18:59:19 Twitter is the worse place for debate, but remember. These are the same people that said one bullet killed the entire Kennedy Car Pool. That 911 was random and sending troops to the Middle East was not about oil. They should stay out of your vagina, but I don't make that call.

2312 2018-06-07 18:57:01 Wow.  What a pathetic attempt. This has nothing to do with the tax cuts and everything to do with rising oil prices which are controlled by OPEC.
2313 2018-06-07 18:57:01 Saudis can raise output simply by returning to 100% compliance rather than 152% but beyond this they need consensus of rest of OPEC. Oil is still rising because this level of constrained increases does not compensate for loss of VZ and Iran.

2327 2018-06-07 18:55:21 We should nationalize our oil. Now that the US is out of the hands of the murderous uniparty, we wouldn't be subject to a foreign coup for doing so like so many South American states who tried to do the same were.

2335 2018-06-07 18:54:10 I wouldn't support the government opening its own solar plants with that money, but I would have preferred to see that same money go to municipalities to add some solar supplementation to their communities. The best gov't is local gov't, and also we shouldn't subsidize big oil.
2336 2018-06-07 18:54:06 But what would Pruitt need more "slime oil" for? He's already covered in enough of it... And seriously, the entitlement mentality of these trump miscreants who rail against entitlements is staggering.

Skin feels like there's a layer of protection. Really liking the Anti Aging Face Cream! Consistency same as my Estee Lauder, but smells better!
2362 2018-06-07 18:51:15 looool I had to stick my hands in gloves filled with bleach and baby oil 
2363 2018-06-07 18:51:13 Oil end sharply higher as traders focus on Iran, Venezuela output
2364 2018-06-07 18:51:12 Rick is lining his campaign pockets by promising to big oil access to Florida's resources. He doesn't care about Floridians or our environment. Slick Rick is at it again. Once a crook always a crook. #ShadyRick #Shameful #SayNo2RickScott
2365 2018-06-07 18:51:03 No thank you
2366 2018-06-07 18:51:00 ７月１０日はオイルの日。「７１０」を逆さにすると「ＯＩＬ」に見えるから
2367 2018-06-07 18:50:55 just started putting castor oil on my brows and lashes and if they don’t thicker im sueing all my desi aunties
2368 2018-06-07 18:50:49 Probably hemp oil or it’s processed in a plant with hemp.
2369 2018-06-07 18:50:46 Short term ( by the end of the year) oil is going well over $80. This is very good for renewables!
2370 2018-06-07 18:50:41 If I bought a Nissan Leaf, it would cost me less money because using electricity instead of buying gas is a lot cheaper.  Yet, what is the carbon foot print of the electric company vs the oil company?
2371 2018-06-07 18:50:37 Yes it sounds insane but I’m sure not out of sync with other product revolutions in relative terms I.e Ford , oil , gold
2372 2018-06-07 18:50:35 How about spending less on oil wars?
2373 2018-06-07 18:50:24 “Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church;& let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:15& the prayer of faith shall save the sick,&the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.Js5:14-15
2374 2018-06-07 18:50:23 Bought some new olive oil stuff for my hair and skin 
2375 2018-06-07 18:50:10 don't forget the rising oil price....
2376 2018-06-07 18:50:01 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.
2377 2018-06-07 18:49:57 Why did I go in for an oil change that should’ve been $20 and left with 4 other things being done and spending $220?? I hate money and responsibilities
2378 2018-06-07 18:49:55 Probably “don’t google at work”
2379 2018-06-07 18:49:48 "According to him" 
2380 2018-06-07 18:49:45 I would say make the smaller changes that you're currently trying to make (cheese, canola oil vs butter, etc) and get retested in 6 months. Compare and then make changes if necessary.
2381 2018-06-07 18:49:37 It’s a gas & oil protestor investors convention.
2382 2018-06-07 18:49:25 This is a formal invitation to @ClubBuu to come with me to the Indianapolis Colts season opener at Lucas Oil Stadium.
2383 2018-06-07 18:49:23 One of the leading causes of orangutan habitat destruction specifically is palm oil, though. Which is technically “vegan” but it does cause orangutans’ habitats to be destroyed. It’s used in so many products.
2384 2018-06-07 18:49:19 Yay!! That’s awesome when I do that too or even put a little bit of lavender oil on the back of my neck it helps me sleep better 
2385 2018-06-07 18:49:15 I think they’re probably smart enough to know that a bunch of oil & gas ads attacking Polis in a Democratic primary would be an in-kind contribution to Polis

2388 2018-06-07 18:49:10 "As long as there's a sucker born every minute, there will be snake oil salesmen." - me
2389 2018-06-07 18:48:58 BREAKING: the latest Scott Pruitt scandal. This time he *spins wheel* replaced the entire Mississippi River with crude oil in return for *throws dart at board* his wife getting a free tank of gas once, and exactly *rolls dice* three staffers will quit over the incident
2390 2018-06-07 18:48:55 Soaked my hair in coconut oil over night    just washing out let’s see results
2391 2018-06-07 18:48:53 Draw the nutrients from it in warmed oil. To use as hair oil.
2392 2018-06-07 18:48:29 *inspects logo* ah yes, black and white and stripped of any flourish, like all symbols of freedom and happiness and not at all like the Nazi party
2393 2018-06-07 18:48:26 Omg josh! That’s wild, I’ll do the $50! But you can just change my oil & I don’t have any windshield fluid haha Where do I go
2394 2018-06-07 18:48:18 Want to buy oil and energy. I think it’s be time. Also what you think about $ibkr?
2395 2018-06-07 18:48:02 Silky touch oil!!!!
2396 2018-06-07 18:48:01 My husband must truly love me (or be super confident the @Twins will win). He just turned off the baseball game to get gas and change the oil in my car. Happy 21st wedding anniversary to me!
2397 2018-06-07 18:47:59 give me "Telegraph Road" all day long :)
2398 2018-06-07 18:47:58 So im waiting for my oil change to be done and some older man sits next to me on the phone and is like “ohh yall on your way to hawaii? Bring me back a hawiian girl so she can spank me.” Man if you dont get tf away from me 
2399 2018-06-07 18:47:55 Hope magnesium oil helps with flare ups.  Worth a try!
2400 2018-06-07 18:47:42 Our government has MURDERED 20 Million+ People Since World War II. Corporations/oil/greed/petrodollar/Pharmaceutical companies driving these murders.

2401 2018-06-07 18:47:41 Hope so Trenni...this guy is a snake oil salesmen, and needs to go!!
2402 2018-06-07 18:47:18 Nnoooi that is not true. We are lazy. We have oil.
2403 2018-06-07 18:46:56 I spent time in armor and cavalry units. I prefer armor. Sneek, shoot, sneek shoot. 
Cavalry, line up and CHARGE!
My tank leaked oil sometimes, it never pooped on my boots. 
2404 2018-06-07 18:46:50 Throwback to when I had a curry at school after being told it didn’t have nuts in and wound up in hospital bc they cooked it in ALMOND OIL
2405 2018-06-07 18:46:48 I’m wondering about the profitability of transporting crude oil by road tankers over a 1000kms! We’re reaping the sins of marginalizing our own areas! @ntvkenya I see this profiting transporters and @TullowOilplc only for now!
2406 2018-06-07 18:46:46 Gallbladder surgery 3rd most common surgery or so.  Curable by $8 of epsom salts and olive oil. It was the first treatment that woke me up to the medical fraud.
2407 2018-06-07 18:46:41 Now playing a round of one of my least favorite food detective games... 
OLIVES: Is That Mold Or Cold Olive Oil??
2408 2018-06-07 18:46:27 axel's so nice..! i just hope he doesn't trip over all that oil..;;
2409 2018-06-07 18:46:20 He just rambles. Double talk. He is a salesman. That's it. Just a peddler. Snake oil salesmen.
2410 2018-06-07 18:46:10 BBQ built out of oil barrel by a wonderful man from the Ivory Coast who sells the best BBQ at @MidletonFarmers every Saturday
2411 2018-06-07 18:46:07 “High school English wasn’t my thing,” said the stranger doing my oil change. 

I smiled, remembering he knows nothing about me, and then I replied.

“That’s okay. Auto mechanics wasn’t mine.”
2412 2018-06-07 18:46:07 Hold up, oil pens that hold THC?
2413 2018-06-07 18:45:42 I started hippie treatment for Frogger today. A thick poultice of bentonite clay, colloidal silver, turmeric and tea tree oil before an Epsom bath and another thick ass turmeric/silver/tea tree oil poultice. Swelling is already visibly reduced.
2414 2018-06-07 18:45:32 @Richieallenshow Any thoughts that the OIL issues are a distraction from FREE energy tech??? Fuckin sack oil and it's wars!!! ?
2415 2018-06-07 18:45:25 Venezuela has the largest oil reserves in the world.
2416 2018-06-07 18:45:22 Trump requested Saudi oil support before Iran nuclear decision.
2417 2018-06-07 18:45:19 Coconut oil is better
2418 2018-06-07 18:45:11 Don’t buy the premise of the Intercept article at all on Kennedy v. Polis. If oil and gas wants to stop Polis — and I’m sure they do — a Salazar endorsement of Kennedy is hardly the way to do it. They could just, you know, do some anti-Polis ads.
2419 2018-06-07 18:45:09 石油[タンク]︰an oil [tank]
2420 2018-06-07 18:44:57 I have a couple options Lynn. I can do an oil change for $20 or for $50 I’ll change the oil & filter, rotate the tires, check your brakes, test the battery, top off all the fluids and I’ll vacuum and wash it.
2421 2018-06-07 18:43:33 For the big ones, chop them up, put them on a cookie sheet, dump oil and cheese and garlic on them and bake till crispy. Oh man. Best fries ever
2422 2018-06-07 18:43:10 Not only do you know the mind of God, you can read the minds of all Americans! There's a carnival out there just waiting for your skills. You can probably shift a few bottles of snake oil while you're at it, "bishop".
2423 2018-06-07 18:42:56 I can confirm, the above method is most sound & practical.

You can, however, get the same effect from condensed skunk oil, a weeks-old gym sock, and three tears of a giant. But the first is just  as simple.
2424 2018-06-07 18:42:43 9ja which way na. When you want to get fuel in this country now you have to get down from your car and crack a joke or two with the fuel attendant, ask about their family members and their favorite sport. Becos I dont understand how 9K fuel be looking like 20naira Groundnut oil

2429 2018-06-07 18:41:58 How long did it take?  Ive heard of castor oil working for them too.
2430 2018-06-07 18:41:57 What can we do? Ambassador Duddy says we can apply pressure on the #oil sector, and work w/#European partners to stockpile #humanitarian assistance. #pcevents #Venezuela
2431 2018-06-07 18:41:54 9. Trillions of dollars in welfare to corporate welfare queens - banks, oil, coal, prescription drugs, etc.  Federal government has spent hundreds of billions of dollars on prescription drug research.  When will Bayh Dole Act be fixed so that drugs based on federal government
2432 2018-06-07 18:41:52 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Los Angeles sleeps.
2433 2018-06-07 18:41:51 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Dallas sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

2437 2018-06-07 18:41:29 Maybe mars needs some freedom if they have something vaguely similar to oil?
2438 2018-06-07 18:41:26 @MPSBethnalGreen  any chance you can oil your gate in the carpark? I work at home and cant focus ...
2439 2018-06-07 18:41:16 I don't need to be concerned about whether my cup is half empty or half full. My cup is continuously running over.

Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over (Ps 23:5).

It's kinda funny though  how when you took the money from big oil. Killawaya  poped it's cap.  Changed Hawaii forever.  bad luck for Hawains  complements of democr

2450 2018-06-07 18:39:50 Because all migrants he shows a complete /dislike/disrespect for couldn't vote? Because the city is full of folk connected with oil= financially secure, so r in the "I'm alright Jack" brigade. I'm in the shire. Both regions need 2 wake up n see what damage their votes do.

2460 2018-06-07 18:38:08 Eucalyptus oil is good for the soul
2461 2018-06-07 18:38:03 Totally agree--we also can't afford that Ed Stelmach era PC emissions tax on the oil industry either. You need to clarify your position.
2462 2018-06-07 18:37:59 The same people who figured out how to do olive oil. I mean. That's one reason I do wonder if gods exist, because a lot of them believe that the gods taught them how.
2463 2018-06-07 18:37:59 Boulerice: "We will end handouts to the oil sector." Page 41 of the Liberal platform. Worse than Trump! How much was given to oil companies last year? Give me a number.

2467 2018-06-07 18:37:15 Stop buying shit with palm oil in it!!!  The deforestation that is happening in Indonesia is happening because companies are making way for Palm oil. Stop using it.
2468 2018-06-07 18:37:11 Wow. Way to go re oil
2469 2018-06-07 18:37:06 Check the oil?
2470 2018-06-07 18:37:04 Just what the fuck did Dolt45 mean when he said Japan will open many oil fields in states?
2471 2018-06-07 18:36:32 So @hayateey1 is damn Beautiful
2472 2018-06-07 18:36:32 Quit catering to big oil. All they want to do is make a profit and to hell with the environment.
2473 2018-06-07 18:36:29 @XboxP3 "It's easy (and fun) to make fun of Microsoft" - Jason Schreider from Kotaku. Don't you ever get fed up with the media? How can the gaming community become nontoxic when people like Jason keep adding oil to the fire. The sad part is that they are in it for the clicks.
2474 2018-06-07 18:36:28 No thank you, @Jose_Pagliery. You can have the "oil"

#QueenWiki #QWUniversity
2475 2018-06-07 18:36:27 Senator, it's nature of empires

US has spent last 70 projecting it's power.

$1trillion dollar deficit is only possible courtesy of the dollar backed by oil.....so you have to protect that at all costs. The ability to create money ad infinitum.

Ergo deep states trade tarrif war

2480 2018-06-07 18:35:29 Water. Olive oil.
2481 2018-06-07 18:35:18 @BorisEP Will #jeremycorbyn support the Biafra referendum movement? They are persecuted by the Nigerian Government, their (Jewish) leader missing, feared dead. In the 60’s their dreams of independence were sold by @UKLabour for access to oil, causing the death of 3million
2482 2018-06-07 18:35:18 You know you gotta stop giving your dog cannabis oil when she gets excited every time the bottle comes out #bakeddoggy
2483 2018-06-07 18:35:18 If s/he's got no prerequisite skills to lose/replace and clean the plug, change oil &/clean carburetor, s/he doesn't deserve to be called a Nigerian.

These are "follow come" skills.
2484 2018-06-07 18:35:17 You seriously expect to cap the burning oil well with a pine-scented air freshener, eight cups of vinegar and a KitKat?
2485 2018-06-07 18:35:14 An uplifting facial mask, neon green, with peppermint, evening primrose oil, and exfoliating microspheres. It comes in a metallic tub.

2488 2018-06-07 18:34:40 No but it is necessary to keep much cash in the pockets of billionaires esp those in the weapons, oil and security businesses... sad!
2489 2018-06-07 18:34:35 Anyway, Chia seed oil is very nice BRB gonna order a bottle or two
2490 2018-06-07 18:34:35 Exports grew by $0.6 billion in April to a new all-time record high; imports fell $0.4 billion. The strength in exports in April was driven by fuel oil, soybeans and corn #marketnotes
2491 2018-06-07 18:34:25 Oil prices are lifting today due to concerns about Venezuela production. This is not enough of a deal versus rising US production. Just a bear market bounce after an $8 fall over two weeks. More downside ahead after a few days of bounce.
2492 2018-06-07 18:34:24 Bad QA/QC in production... I don't know how they'll fix it.
Strange. Like seeing Ferrari leaving the gap for oil entrance.
2493 2018-06-07 18:34:23 Seems like u have been fed with all wrong info and figures. Go,take some rest.
Do u want me to compare LNG vs furnace oil?
 Neelum jehlum was delayed n looted by Mush n his friends.Fully uniform controlled project till Chinese subcontractor took over.
USD 34B is baseless figure.
2494 2018-06-07 18:34:20 @jerrybrahh I do need some tires and an oil change 
2495 2018-06-07 18:34:20 He means ~sweat~ or ~oil~
2496 2018-06-07 18:34:14 There was another brand that made a Chia oil that I loved, but she 'accidentally' shaded me beyond repair. Wouldnt spit on the brand if it were on fire.
2497 2018-06-07 18:34:14 Rudy "keep the evidentiary bar high" Giuliani is nothing more than a PR snake oil salesman at this point. Mr. Avenatti is the lone voice of reason in this desert of insanity.
2498 2018-06-07 18:34:13 I can't imagine the President of Kenya travelling all the way to Turkana to flag off transportation of crude oil that ends up in idle tanks in Mombasa at a non-functional (dead) facility.
2499 2018-06-07 18:34:02 I need a car that runs on vegetable oil

2501 2018-06-07 18:33:57 Warren is a snake oil salesman selling whiskey as a health tonic to the masses. She will pluck at the heart strings while lying about her own heritage & ignoring laws, logic, reality, and millions of loyal Americans
2502 2018-06-07 18:33:51 You're optimistic. Me, I think that this pipeline with oil in North-Dakota is a big scandal. There's no freedom of religion for the native Americans.
2503 2018-06-07 18:33:50 @DavidNdii, wouldn't it be economically feasible to transport the crude oil from Nairobi to Mombasa using the SGR?
2504 2018-06-07 18:33:43 I started the Neutrogena Hydro Boost cleansing Gel a few months ago and my skin has been grateful ever since! Do you have any recommendations for a specific vit C gel/oil?
2505 2018-06-07 18:33:40 Lol I didnt win department election, but won the most notorious faculty election,was a parliamentarian at Nakss,challenged d school institution ,victimized,locked, till freedom was won,so I'm not a comrade by election but by struggle.
2506 2018-06-07 18:33:29 OK, this is a tip that will change your life, or the life of someone you love.

CBD oil.

Research it.

I’ve put it out there.  You can blow by this tweet, or you might just google it.

2515 2018-06-07 18:32:48 Aquí le echan truffle oil a cualquier mierda y chacho, se descontró el menú. Pa’ Food Network.
2516 2018-06-07 18:32:39 In what currency sis? Plus, they have one of the biggest oil fields (and reserves) in the world. The gov sells at that price with hopes that citizens will smuggle into other countries, and generate some income for themselves...
2517 2018-06-07 18:32:28 My wife makes insect repellent with unscented lotion, eucalyptus oil and peppermint oil. Not sure of the measures or if it works with chiggers - none up here. Works with mosquitoes, no-see-ums and ticks.
2518 2018-06-07 18:32:24 The Mezan cooking oil Alzheimer’s ad was refreshing. Good job by you guys :)
2519 2018-06-07 18:32:13 Lol I accidentally got hot oil on my face yesterday at work and now I have a dark mark on my face lmfao kill me
2520 2018-06-07 18:32:10 .That store is unChristian! Christians & Conservatives should rise above that type of behavior. As for the countries - despicable. We should stop trade with them. But wait - Saudi Arabia’s oil?  oh well... Brits et al think we’re barbaric bc we have the death penalty.
2521 2018-06-07 18:32:07 RT @rich_goldberg

The silent treatment is sustainable  for a non-Iranian oil importing country. For oil importers, refusing to negotiate significant reduction exceptions won’t turn out well in Nov.
2522 2018-06-07 18:31:56 I love the old oil fields, and I'm thinking about the Sanchez adobe, orig San Gabriel mission, old cemetery, and esp the battle sites like Battle of Rio San Gabriel. There must be all kinds of artifacts under the riverbed. Also Marisela Norte is from there ;)
2523 2018-06-07 18:31:48 You need to get the pastry as thin as possible. Also the oil needs to be at 170c or just over. If you throw a piece of pastry in and it bubbles and floats to the top immediately, the oil should be ready. If it's not hot enough, your samosas will be greasy.
2524 2018-06-07 18:31:44 I would love to team up with you on starting some sort of coalition that stops big business from using palm oil that isn’t sustainable. I own an ecotourism company and we could plan a trip to Borneo as well
2525 2018-06-07 18:31:41 Have you joined an oil rig or concrete crew recently?
2526 2018-06-07 18:31:37 Finally  our first crude oil get to mombasa... @KBCChannel1 @RayManyara

2528 2018-06-07 18:31:24 It’s not abt the cost lol it’s the extra apps I have to download just to talk/ see u .... it’s the missed opportunities to play iMessage games while I’m getting an oil change. It’s the inconvenience of trying to connect with y’all 
2529 2018-06-07 18:31:24 Oil dey ur head.
2530 2018-06-07 18:31:04 The government of Zambia has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Alessandra Ambrosio in a ballistic nylon wig.
2531 2018-06-07 18:30:56 One time my dad was changing my oil and he found drugs under my hood and the only way he believed that they weren’t mine is because I didn’t even know how to open my hood so you bitches framed the wrong girl
2532 2018-06-07 18:30:42 People be doing too much. Dodo doesn’t need all that, just slice it up and throw inside oil or palm oil like some very mad people do.
2533 2018-06-07 18:30:38 Just owning and handleing bunnies is abuse. Oil in human hands can cause them piscine tuberculosis.
2534 2018-06-07 18:30:37 So unlike your oil, your transmission doesn’t have a dip stick, you can’t really gage when the transmission fluid or filter should be checked or changed. Most authorities in the industry actually recommend that it would be changed about every 3 years or 36,000 miles.
2535 2018-06-07 18:30:32 Na England  (aka The Three Cats) I pity pass for this World Cup. Dem go soon know say ororo no be crude oil.

2538 2018-06-07 18:30:22 Mozzarella is one of the most popular cheese choices for pizza. Research shows that it has the highest moisture, the lowest quantity of free oil, good elasticity, and unique stretchability when compared to cheeses of the world.
2539 2018-06-07 18:30:05 Well I say we are all being controlled by a cult who own the banking and oil industry(basically the whole world), but I’m not famous so my words mean nothing to you  #WWG1WGA

2541 2018-06-07 18:29:55 Facts show he has decimated the resource sector with billions of investment leaving. He has to put this show on so it won't be so obvious what he is up to. Make no mistake @JustinTrudeau wants oil left in the ground and wants to kill the oil industry.
2542 2018-06-07 18:29:46 i needed an oil change got one and not stuck watching bell 
2543 2018-06-07 18:29:41 An absolutely fair question, especially given Guerrero's 'snake oil' past.
2544 2018-06-07 18:29:25 MKO honored today but I keep asking myself y? A man who wit alhaji alhaji embezzled the first oil contract signed wit Brazil. A man who sponsored a coup wit agreement of been given power later.A man who betrayed his fellow tribal man for money and stopped from achieving his dream
2545 2018-06-07 18:29:23 Not true. Its summer dude. We have our own oil.
2546 2018-06-07 18:29:10 Why threaten?  Impeach!  Cheap threats so that she can oil their pockets.  Kenya is becoming a sorry state.
2547 2018-06-07 18:29:05 Lets take steel for instance, the Chinese have made steel so cheap that our steel manufactures aren't able to compete so those guys were already hurting.. Problem is Chinese steel is sub par - the oil and gas industry won't use it because of the poor quality..
2548 2018-06-07 18:29:05 depends on your trigger. Usually sitting in the shower with really hot water, peppermint oil directly on my temples/forehead (it burns really good) I have this little gel bead eye mask that I freeze too.
2549 2018-06-07 18:28:58 I bathe in oil after I shower. Sooo like y da fuq am I still so ashy tho¿

2552 2018-06-07 18:28:45 Trump says Japan is opening new oil plants in several states. What does that mean?
2553 2018-06-07 18:28:45 So far I'm digging the @Lenovo #Chromebook 500e. If I had one complaint, it would be that the device is a hand oil magnet which makes it look dirty all of the time.
2554 2018-06-07 18:28:43 angry toddler gods of oil, eagerly keeping watch for history, with all of you.
2555 2018-06-07 18:28:39 plastic can be made from corn and it’s 100% biodegradable and compostable + corn is a super renewable resource making it a great alternative to oil & non biodegradable plastics:)

2567 2018-06-07 18:27:00 Okay that baby oil theory for tan doesn’t work
2568 2018-06-07 18:26:53 Willing to pay someone to take my card and car to get an oil change it genuinely gives me so much anxiety and I would pass if I weren't already 3000 miles over
2569 2018-06-07 18:26:50 You need to be rude, I see. That undermines the quality of your argument.

Your question depends on the amount of the salary, on the value of the currency, and on the state of the economy.

You are an incompetent reductionist.
2570 2018-06-07 18:26:50 Hahaha yeah kidding.
2571 2018-06-07 18:26:43 If the U.S. were to stop importing #oil, are we hurting the people of #Venezuela or the #government more? That's where we are stuck right now, says Ambassador @shapiro_WAC. #pcevents

2586 2018-06-07 18:24:58 Caron: Canada is giving the oil patch $1.5b a year in subsidies. Justin has no credibility after buying TMX.

McKenna: We don't need to redeem ourselves because no-one believed our environmental promises in the first place.

2587 2018-06-07 18:24:55 Got a few nice things at the antique store near my place. Some cute little vinnegar/olive oil bottles w/ a carriage, a big ol' A&W mug, some nice coasters and some new wristbands.
2588 2018-06-07 18:24:46 I'm trying @soylent. The Cafe Coffiest tastes oily to me (I know it contains oil. I just didn't expect that aspect to be so prominent.). I've got the Chai & Vanilla flavors, too, so I'll try those before making a final judgment. It's definitely convenient to grab and go, though.
2589 2018-06-07 18:24:33 Your cellphone is made frm oil. Ur car. TV,  roads. There r over 6000 items made frm oil. Anything that is a polymer is made frm oil. And by the way Obama didnt address this either! Ur so called green energy needs oil to b produced and to operate.

2591 2018-06-07 18:24:15 Multiply our “small” number time our population. Multiply their “small” number by their population. How many more dead in USA?

Or

Is a 1% raise in your salary the same as 5%?

You are clearly a statistical incompetent
2592 2018-06-07 18:24:08 And that too, when global factors were in our favour. Low oil prices n Chinese recession.
2593 2018-06-07 18:24:04 Nothing says “I work in the oil field” like a trailer house and 2 fine ass Can-Ams in the yard....wtf am I doing on the farm?!?
2594 2018-06-07 18:24:01 Caron: Canada's record on the environment is bad. Justin swore to reduce oil patch subsidies, but three years later, we're still the worst in the G7.

McKenna: I'm very proud of what we're doing environmentally, which is using it as a club against the CPC!

2597 2018-06-07 18:23:28 I went last year and it still had a hot topic. Can you share what is historic about it? The oil drilling? The applebees?

2603 2018-06-07 18:22:48 Baby oil, I bet. Keeps that skin nice and smooth, too. Not recommended for extensive outdoor use, however, as a crispy, bubbling sensation may occur.
2604 2018-06-07 18:22:34 perfect send the democrat liberals there to live.. see how quickly they learn to live without oil and gas, heat and cold, electricity

2606 2018-06-07 18:21:56 With Trump getting out of the Iran deal, Iran is putting less oil on the global market causing increased fuel prices.  Those costs “trickle down” to the consumer in the form of increased prices on everything shipped by truck, where oil is used in manufacturing goods, etc.
2607 2018-06-07 18:21:56 Yes!!!  Just started using olive/coconut oil as well.  I ran the herbs through my food processor, heated them on the stove with some seasoning and the oil, then froze.  Only used twice but I'm really happy with the results.

2612 2018-06-07 18:21:05 The bigger picture is that the US wants to control Iran’s oil and gas

Like it did when the US overthrew w the democratically elected Iranian government 1953 to install a Western Puppet.

Iran has now gained control with the Islamic revolution and the US corporate elite not happy

   But with the banking one. You do realize that Iran needed some access to world banks and ours because the world uses the US dollar for oil. And they needed more access in order to trade. Sanctions uses it as a way to sanction. So some of it was true.
2620 2018-06-07 18:20:18 I think she lied about that, too. The company she said she worked for, is a KENYAN oil company. Declicious.

2641 2018-06-07 18:17:50 Revenues from resources like oil and gas are exactly what has kept the government of Alberta afloat, did you think they magically printed the money?
2642 2018-06-07 18:17:38 getting my oil change
2643 2018-06-07 18:17:30 Kenya got Oil. Cheers to that  #TrapaDrive
2644 2018-06-07 18:17:27 Paula the same as the service men and woman have to do and the bin men and nurses, oil workers Police Officers, Firemen it is called having a job and yes although sad the job takes priority.  We all have to suck it up and get on with it nothing to do with empathy.
2645 2018-06-07 18:17:26 2/... 'out there', there is another option of removing it from your body with thought, but that is whole 'nther long explanation).  Boosting your immune system has incredible results. Canabis oil SUPER boosts the immune system. Like I said, immediate experience!  I swear by it!
2646 2018-06-07 18:17:22 just so you know the vendetta against plastic straws is ABLEIST and literally doesnt have a positive effect on the environment. maybe you should all pledge to mobilizing against oil pipelines and funding renewable and sustainable energy practices???????
2647 2018-06-07 18:17:06 I have the best summer activity in mind but black people and making plans is like water and oil
2648 2018-06-07 18:16:48 After work I’m getting my oil changed & my car detailed 
2649 2018-06-07 18:16:36 I'm worried about the coal and the climate. There's also this pipeline with oil in North-Dakota, but I think there's a better way to solve that. People should stay calm and be rational. The world needs some common sense.
2650 2018-06-07 18:16:26 Dear @Benecol I just spotted that Palm Oil is an ingredient in your spreads, which means I can no longer, in any conscience, buy it again. #SayNoToPalmOil #savetheorangutan #orangutan

2654 2018-06-07 18:15:58 @ArianaGrande have you ever used tea tree oil on your face (it’s my everyday/ever night skin routine) then suddenly realise you squeezed the bottle to hard and poured out half the bottle onto you’re INVISIBLE SUNBURN????

2657 2018-06-07 18:15:27 we live in the era where Arabs give wisdom fuck the oil
2658 2018-06-07 18:15:21 Now you're lying - China will never have a carbon tax, Australia ditched theirs, Germany drastically cut theirs - the carbon tax is a fraud and oil and gas and coal ain't going anywhere -
2659 2018-06-07 18:15:16 the mechanic who just gave my car an oil change just bonded with me because im from massachusetts and he’s from providence us new englandies living in florida have to stick together
2660 2018-06-07 18:15:14 RT @LivingSafely: Eating mayonnaise this June? It's made by adding oil to egg yolks. Commercial mayo can be as much as 80% fat!
2661 2018-06-07 18:15:07 Always oil your scalp before you wash & massage it for 5 minutes before you wash, after conditioning, rinse w 50% acv & H2O & base w a oil
2662 2018-06-07 18:14:50 Agree! It is shocking, the amount of products they put palm oil in! Luckily it’s possible and not so difficult to live without :-)
2663 2018-06-07 18:14:43 I mean just go ahead and let us get those fracking rights back for the people and I don’t think anyone would bitch if they struck oil in their yard and sold the land to an oil company, but that’s not how it is if we strike it it’s theirs because of the pfd. Just an fyi

2665 2018-06-07 18:14:28 Since 2008, the U.S. has continued to list key figures in #Venezuela as sanctioned individuals, w/other countries following suit. But we haven't decided to stop buying oil from them and remain their largest market, says Amb. Duddy #pcevents
2666 2018-06-07 18:14:23 Sometimes I wonder why we have to export the little crude oil we have from Turkana yet we Import the same from Libya. Anyway, this is Kenya where a towel from NYS costs Kshs.100,000
2667 2018-06-07 18:14:08 Got $8 off an oil change just for being friendly. Being nice sometimes pays off. $21 oil change & I'm not complaining.
2668 2018-06-07 18:13:48 Put too much coconut oil in my hair. Sad times.
2669 2018-06-07 18:13:40 whoever wants to oil my scalp i’ll provide weed & sangria
2670 2018-06-07 18:13:31 I disagree, as you know, but that's another subject.
2671 2018-06-07 18:13:29 Lock up your beard oil, this man has reached dangerous levels of FRESH
2672 2018-06-07 18:13:23 @LibertyHumanist Thanks for the follow. Neither does what I say sit well with people socially or professionally here in my oil and agriculture-based Central Valley Californian "little bible belt." But I'm going to keep saying it too!
2673 2018-06-07 18:13:16 The Alberta economy tanked due to the collapse in global oil prices.  That is a fact. I'm not sure how you can possibly lay that at the feet of the Provincial and Federal PC governments at the time.  How should they have propped up global pricing? Plead with OPEC? Buy up supply?

2675 2018-06-07 18:13:15 The same thing happens everywhere, look at Palestinians getting massacred and not a peep from the govt. It really depends on what the govt can get out of it, Iraq had oil and they felt they could create a US friendly state in the region. Iranian people mean very little to them

2682 2018-06-07 18:12:39 I didnt buy some oatmeal biscuits today as they had Palm Oil in them
2683 2018-06-07 18:12:15 It is definitely a strange feeling. It's very airy. Very 'light' feeling. Bouncy? It's like waking up and my shoulder *not* hurting and grinding; it's like....is this what a machine feels like after getting new oil?
2684 2018-06-07 18:12:01 Mysterious producer and @au_ght member Topdown Dialectic is about to release his first album on vinyl; it drops this week via the LA-based Peak Oil label. This murky, constantly moving tune is the album's "B3" cut.
2685 2018-06-07 18:11:58 Americans do NOT want socialism in our country.
2686 2018-06-07 18:11:44 That’s what they claim, but when policy rolls out it ends up being businesses looking to expand and 30% of wage earners. The 1% only exist on Wall Street, Silicon Valley and Big Oil.

2689 2018-06-07 18:11:34 @jimcramer if Oil prices get too hi like they did in 2014 at over $100Brl will we r cud see another kind of oil stock decline r crash like we saw so many take major hits in 2015 and now we are just starting to see a spike again in the last 2 r 3qtrs. For instance a small player
2690 2018-06-07 18:11:31 You need all the oil on you! 
2691 2018-06-07 18:11:26 And the only changes to laws are to deregulate them and let the market take care of itself without big nanny government interference. Socialism is a failed paradigm and needs to go away completely.
2692 2018-06-07 18:11:21 CBD OIL & SOURSOP are 2 powerful products when used together!
2693 2018-06-07 18:10:53 If true the entire cabinet should be rolled in beaten egg then fresh breadcrumbs then golden breadcrumbs fried in a swimming pool of boiling rapeseed oil and served al dente to Scottish Trawler crews with a slice of lemon
2694 2018-06-07 18:10:50 Oooooh. Where to begin. Truckers strike becauz of diesel tax. Corruption at every level of government. Brother in law waited 3 hours in line for gas last week. And they are an oil producing country. Gas price same as here inthe states. Per Capira income is NOT!!
2695 2018-06-07 18:10:42 You expect logic?
2696 2018-06-07 18:10:33 140 year life spans thanks to oil money
2697 2018-06-07 18:10:29 I’m all about adding that tiny bit of vegetable oil and club soda - gives them the perfect texture/ fluffiness
2698 2018-06-07 18:10:21 Liar, you said times is always a valid comparison. I showed how you're wrong. Stop making wild leaps of logic.
2699 2018-06-07 18:10:17 Approx 300 million barrels of oil per year for gold versus 6 million barrels of oil for bitcoin if i recall correctly
2700 2018-06-07 18:10:13 may be due to fed, oil price hike, CPI hardening they became conservative and followed the mkt
2701 2018-06-07 18:10:13 The House has voted 71–13 to concur with the Senate amendments on HB 430, which makes additional changes regarding the sales tax exemption for oil and gas production property. I voted yes.

2705 2018-06-07 18:10:05 I need to learn how to change my own tire and oil... I already know these new age niggas don’t know how.
2706 2018-06-07 18:10:05 Plastic waste needs to be recycled & used to create new plastic based products.  The companies producing plastic won’t like this, nor would oil companies that provide oil derivatives used to make plastic.  However, the oil companies can become energy companies using emissions...2
2707 2018-06-07 18:09:51 Wait can you change some break pads or oil change. jk jk
2708 2018-06-07 18:09:47 This what happens when u stop concentrating on ur own country to other to run ur affairs for oil for food program.
2709 2018-06-07 18:09:47 the oil rig displayed in this article does not represent the #Tarsands!
Oil can be pumped, tar is not a liquid.
2710 2018-06-07 18:09:44 If it's decent wood, use some Murphey's oil (I use their wipes) to give it a final wipe down. Will make it look better and make the finish last longer. Even if it's just veneer, it will make it look extra fresh.
2711 2018-06-07 18:09:32 No, we don't need "massive gun control reform," unless you mean the elimination of laws that violate rights.
2712 2018-06-07 18:09:31 Another explosion  7 hurt and they are being transported to burn unit in Pittsburgh.  Prayers for the oil workers  today and continue prayers for the 2 coal miner killed in 2 separate accidents in last 2 days

2715 2018-06-07 18:09:27 I have emails from places that sell the oil on line. I know it’s supposed to be the best replacement for pills but not sure I trust the quality of the product that’s being advertised through the mail.
2716 2018-06-07 18:09:25 Got an oil change at dealership and they filled the tank 
2717 2018-06-07 18:09:24 thats why the Nasa led Peoples Assembly Process was the best initiative too date...dialogue among communities ni lazima..oil and gems belong to the Turkana people...not the political elite who call themselves Kenyans..thats code 4 exploitation!

2719 2018-06-07 18:09:04 Yeah, and many ingredients too, like ogbono, egusi, plam oil, are grown and picked around, even fish and meat sometimes. Basically they only buy very little.
2720 2018-06-07 18:08:58 No, liar, the subject is what causes the difference in rates of violence. I've given an explanation and an implied solution. Now stop lying.
2721 2018-06-07 18:08:52 I'm a Socialist.
We need massive gun control reform in this country.
We also need massive changes to our corporate laws, banking regulations, and tax systems to address the rampant income inequality plaguing our nation.
We can fight for both.

2726 2018-06-07 18:08:18 You cannot blame IS for destruction of Raqqa & Mosul  the coalition destroyed it. Mosul and raqqa reconstruction can be re built through oil and gas sales
2727 2018-06-07 18:08:12 Corps are answering to a biggest demand and want to earn most possible. We need to be more conscious about  what's happening to produce cheaper food. Palm oil is cheaper but nocive! In our days almost everything contains it. We need to change what we consume, stopping the chain.
2728 2018-06-07 18:08:10 Taken from the survey:"It is essential for installers, suppliers and manufacturers in the coal and oil sectors to show leadership" This illustrates the probelem: why is it essential for a supplier (who profits from supply) to show leadership. I counter they should LISTEN

2748 2018-06-07 18:04:00 Um, context matters. If you're saying that one thing is five times another, mathematically, that may be correct, but if both numbers are small, this point may have limited significance to the subject being discussed.

2759 2018-06-07 18:02:35 good to see a correction to the failure of the left to appreciate Sun oil and the pews and the relation between right wing industry and kkk

someone actually wrote a whole book about this
2760 2018-06-07 18:02:24 Hahahahaha. Times is ALWAYS how numbers are compared.

1000 ==> 5000

Is exactly the same as

2776 2018-06-07 18:00:37 RT @LivingSafely: Eating mayonnaise this June? It's made by adding oil to egg yolks. Commercial mayo can be as much as 80% fat!

2782 2018-06-07 18:00:08 they’re beef flavored (used to be fried in the burger fat but not anymore, it’s veggie oil) so that’s probably it
2783 2018-06-07 18:00:06 But you cling to guns as the magic bullet explanation for everything.
2784 2018-06-07 18:00:05 Documentation is the castor oil of programming. Managers know it must be good because the programmers hate it so much.

2787 2018-06-07 17:59:45 Thanks, @expomick. Good drop! #AlexfromAB from a fellow Albertan, you can fall in an oil well, you old racist.
2788 2018-06-07 17:59:45 Your smugness isn't justified. As you keep telling us, we have a higher homicide rate. Thus our rate of crime isn't the same. We have a dysfunctional education system. Poverty here is worse than in "comparable" countries, thanks to our weak welfare system.

2790 2018-06-07 17:59:02 Damn dead beat dads, just at the part store and seen this mom teaching her son (looked like he was 14-15 years old) how to check the oil. Don’t get me wrong moms can do that too but it really didn’t seem like that cars are her thing.
2791 2018-06-07 17:59:01 I’m 235 miles over an oil change 
2792 2018-06-07 17:58:56 OECD*
2793 2018-06-07 17:58:48 Not at all. You first said ORCD nations are comparable now you’re going away from that. Make up your mind.
2794 2018-06-07 17:58:48 Right now I'm just using cheap stuff because I gave up. I uses an It cosmetics one and the Kiehl's face cream that's raved about. And I tried a brand from online but that one is too thin and doesn't actually add moisture I tried a face oil a while back
2795 2018-06-07 17:58:28 What's his point? I thought everyone knew that there wasn't actually WMD in Iraq, and that Bush went in to get votes and oil.
2796 2018-06-07 17:58:23 Been analyzing prices for barrels of oil per month from January 1974 to March 2018.
Just tryna figure out why the FUCK gas is almost at $3
2797 2018-06-07 17:58:07 Like an oil painting Marie!
2798 2018-06-07 17:57:53 As any educated human knows, the rates of crime, poverty and mental illness are identical in comparable countries...the only difference is our insane number of guns.

2805 2018-06-07 17:56:44 So I think that instead of being allergic to the oil paint I think my rash was caused by something zoe got into, because I've since gotten paint on me and no rash
2806 2018-06-07 17:56:33 Bake it. Sprinkle with olive oil and sea salt for extra crispy skin!
2807 2018-06-07 17:56:26 True. Thats what we need. It is the next crude oil of the world.
2808 2018-06-07 17:56:19 Why do you hate us?! Second day of having to play tag over email, call customers from cell phones, install apps that make calls. I know you won’t be crediting us for this but at least have the decency to use a little KY or cocoanut oil before you F me again 
2809 2018-06-07 17:56:15 Ugh ugh what are you using right now? Have you tried like jojoba oil or something v pure/natural?
2810 2018-06-07 17:56:09 Is it just the oil? That’s even better.
2811 2018-06-07 17:56:04 Just imagine being the noble city-state of Singapore. You're trying hard to expand into the sea. You've got some awesome new oil storage tanks. Your UN delegation made the first snowman by Singaporeans recently. Things are looking bright. Then here comes the worst Hungarian ever.

2828 2018-06-07 17:53:33 Sounds like they’re employing same tactics as the oil industry does in North America. Sorry long weekend?  Oh we have to double our production so we will have to raise prices.
2829 2018-06-07 17:53:29 Coconut oil solidifies when it's cold so if you are using it for your hair it will look like you have dandruff sometimes so substitute with olive oil #GirlTalkZA

2849 2018-06-07 17:50:38 Very close?
We're 3 or 4 times higher than comparable countries.
Do you always measure 'close' in exponents?
2850 2018-06-07 17:50:27 He was activated to serve during the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill, and Hurricanes Sandy and Irene.[4] Myke Cole served in Iraq, two tours as a security contractor and a third as a Department of Defense civilian. I doubt you had anywhere near his level of commitment. So STFU. 2/2
2851 2018-06-07 17:50:27 Enough words, time to cook. Grilled lamb chops and roasted cauliflower, carrots, and potatoes all tossed with olive oil and feta cheese. Strawberries and meringues for dessert.
2852 2018-06-07 17:50:26 Clinton devoted her 4 years at State to selling the world the glories of #fracking. It is extremely fair, even generous, to describer her as "no friend" to climate change activists. (to oil and gas lobbyists, she's absolutely a good friend...)
2853 2018-06-07 17:50:23 Yip, Sasolburg. But wait there is more. SASOL make their fuel from coal. This is MUCH cheaper than making fuel from oil. They base their selling price on crude. We are getting shafted all the way.
2854 2018-06-07 17:50:18 Example: Capex in oil is usually preceded by an uptick / sustained higher price of crude.
2855 2018-06-07 17:50:13 Ugh I’m such an adult I took my car to get an oil change and now I’m getting it washed and detailed
2856 2018-06-07 17:50:13 Hey @JimIrsay, I live like 2 blocks away from Lucas Oil by Shapiros. Since we are practically neighbors, is their any way I can get a couple tickets for this season? Thanks in advance. Plus you’re invited to my first tailgate of the season.

2861 2018-06-07 17:49:02 But the country wasn't broke. Burning bondholders, jailing bankers, seizing/repurposing their assets, wealth taxes, hiked and retroactively collected corp. tax, revising terms of state selloff deals on oil.
2862 2018-06-07 17:48:51 Oil pipelines, fracking, & the BP oil spill prove this:
The damage to our environment will be felt for many years. We are on the cusp of freeing ourselves from the grip of #BigOil, yet these @GOP morons continue to pander to oil companies, taking their donor money. #VoteBlue #FBR
2863 2018-06-07 17:48:30 We have windmills also not hearing anything but those old oil and gas wells, some can be used for geothermal power.But not much noise on that yet.

2864 2018-06-07 17:48:19 Okay but like where tf do I take my car for an oil change I really don’t wanna take it to my dealership anymore

2870 2018-06-07 17:47:46 The ONLY reason a section of the country continues to shout ONE Nigeria is because there is one OIL flowing from the South. Imagine if there is no oil. Haaaa!!! They would have long reminded the rest of us that there is nothing in culture, believe or practice that binds us.

2877 2018-06-07 17:46:57 Decided to experiment and fry up some chicken using chili-infused oil. The results were perfect but it does render the kitchen uninhabitable during cooking as the chili fills the air and also your lungs.

2881 2018-06-07 17:46:36 What about Libya ? Do you have specific information about oil production?
2882 2018-06-07 17:46:36 USDA and FDA always give business a huge Lee time to correct and or change. Remember when FDA banned TFA and GMA sought out Palm Oil instead. Same thing from FDA on the new updated Nutrition Facts Panel.
2883 2018-06-07 17:46:34 Oil leaks. It doesn't take very much oil to pollute water.
2884 2018-06-07 17:46:25 Trump and Putin want you to keep using oil and coal so they can continue to get richer (oil) and appease "their" base (coal). Thank God various states are enacting their own legislation to continue the fight for clean energy.

2905 2018-06-07 17:44:32 Ok.
Here's a simple litmus test.
Make 3 scientist paid by big oil and name the amount of funding they received.
It appears you have more data than I...
I look forward to seeing all of this data you have. Maybe I'll change my mind.

2909 2018-06-07 17:44:18 Yes. And rights will be more and more trampled by both the snake oil sellers and buyers. But they're not the only scared ones:  as they gain more and more power, it's terrifying to consider the impact on the future of this country and on democracy.

Ok well everyone I know with turbo needs to randomly add a bit of oil so sorry

2916 2018-06-07 17:43:27 4. LEMON PEEL 

-put 1 tbsp of dried peel into a container. 
-pour enough olive/castor oil into the container to soak the peel. 
-let it sit for a couple of weeks. 
-use an old mascara brush to apply it to your lashes daily and leave on overnight. 
-use for a few months.
2917 2018-06-07 17:43:26 Sunin along with your baby oil and iodine. What sunscreen???????  Never.
2918 2018-06-07 17:43:26 Slowly but surely converting Americans to using oil cleansers. (They’re great! Try one!)
2919 2018-06-07 17:43:22 Governments never done well when they go up against corporations though historically. I’ll believe it when oil giants start buying clean energy companies then it will definitely happen.
2920 2018-06-07 17:43:16 You're dodging.

Note how we're very close to the countries with lower rates? Note how the chart creates a false impression by truncating the scale?
2921 2018-06-07 17:43:01 Absolutely! India imported $12B edible oil last year, 65% of its consumption, yet it would not allow its farmers to plant gene enhanced varieties of mustard, maize or groundnut that would make it self sufficient, cut import bills, reduce use of pesticides, increase rural income

2923 2018-06-07 17:42:42 "WE MAKE LAW NOW" *strips off all clothing except for a tattered loin cloth and begins covering self in oil and tribal markings*
"Hey so we were able to approve you promotion to....."
*gradually slows down the oiling*
".. promotion to, uhh..."

"You know what never mind."
2924 2018-06-07 17:42:39 It doesn’t make up for the rise in healthcare and oil.
2925 2018-06-07 17:42:38 Palm oil is on almost everything  it sucks
2926 2018-06-07 17:41:58 Teapot Dome. Interior partnering with big oil, bribery and kickbacks, obstruction of justice.  Supreme Court ruling that Congress can compel testimony. A CABINET MEMBER WENT TO PRISON.
2927 2018-06-07 17:41:55 Today one can't even receive prophecy at church if he doesn't "sow a seed" or buy an "oil" from the prophet. Corruption is the in church too.

2929 2018-06-07 17:41:34 I think she may be more successful if she promoted a sex oil scent or a douche fragrance. I ain't no marketing genius but damn, stick with what you are good at. Just saying.
2930 2018-06-07 17:41:27 Yes, actually... Look into why these trees are being cut down. Most often they are to make space for animal feed or to make palm oil. The less of those things you eat, the less the demand will be for them, the less companies will make of them and the less trees will be cut down.
2931 2018-06-07 17:41:19 Pulled up to abuelas she made me one of them Dominican ass sammiches. Oil vinegar aguakate n hard boiled egg n onions. #desayunodepobre
2932 2018-06-07 17:41:19 CA also produces a lot of oil but nobody outside of CA seems to know that so you're probably right.

2937 2018-06-07 17:40:32 How important humidity is: a needle injection every 3 days, mineral oil on the eye 2-3 times a day and this paste stuff. Mushroom isn’t going to see as well anymore. He can barley see right now. Imma stop rescuing right here cause it makes me so mad people r dumb
2938 2018-06-07 17:40:27 man it's really hard to tell the difference between modern day israel and nazi sympathizers
mostly because of the genocide, you see.
eventually we're gonna get tired of shoveling cash into a genocidal regime- at least the wahhabists have oil

2943 2018-06-07 17:40:09 Also to be fair overall the liberal party has done some cool things post gas plant scandal and in truth trudeau trynna phase out the oil sands is pretty cool.. provincially though that isnt involved
2944 2018-06-07 17:39:54 I like that place a lot, but always take orders to go. I can't risk smelling like (delicious) cooking oil the rest of the day.

2947 2018-06-07 17:39:48 Well, there are some companies that claim to certify it, but it is a complicated minefield. It can't all be checked; it is often just a case of trusting them. Nearly all "certified" palm oil plantations are still on cleared rainforest and inseparable from it. #PalmOil

2951 2018-06-07 17:39:10 3. ALOE VERA 

-apply onto a cotton swab or a spoolie brush and sweep it across the eyelashes and lash line. 
-leave on overnight and rinse it off in the morning with warm water. 
-or mix 1 tbsp aloe Vera gel, 1 tbsp jojoba oil and 1 tsp chamomile oil leave it on for fifteen.

2954 2018-06-07 17:39:00 Anyone knows 1) where I can get alabaster or beautifully carved empty jars and if not 2) do you know someone who is good at carving alabaster and where can I buy alabaster.. Hmmm. I have a special gift in mind for those who purchase 5 ounces of oil and up.
2955 2018-06-07 17:38:45 Wrong as always. Or do you seriously believe that our schools and welfare system are as good as the ones in those other countries?

2958 2018-06-07 17:38:25 That's not true, I've put peppermint oil on my skin a million times to help with muscle soreness. It's just moderation.
2959 2018-06-07 17:38:16 It’s a psychological tactic you know that you’ll wait a lil longer for a 5 guys burger than the typical fast food burger so they give you something to munch on while you wait that that extra 5-7 mins for your food. & they also use peanut oil from the same company for the fries.
2960 2018-06-07 17:38:12 Ati  Kikuyus came from Ethiopia and while crossing Lake Turkana their boats started sinking and capsized meaning in Kikuyu *GUTURUKANA* hence the name Turkana
That means, they have ancestral claim of land and oil ownership in Turkana

2964 2018-06-07 17:37:32 American people pay taxes which goes to the army that works for Arms industry/Oil cartels not them. This for-profit-army is for rent, while Americans pay out if their pocket to support it and its profit goes to billionaires and makes other countries hate Americans.

2968 2018-06-07 17:37:00 Glad to learn that all heating #Oil sold in New England next year will be ultra low sulphur.  Also glad that shipping fuel will follow suit in 2020. #environment less #pollution
2969 2018-06-07 17:36:48 Agree. Seems too much of coincidence that behemoths who emerged over last 20 to 25 yrs all did so here. Corp life cycle of big oil seemed more globally balanced, as did electronics.
2970 2018-06-07 17:36:26 Fresh cut, oil changed, and paid all my bills. I’m broke but I feel accomplished lol

2975 2018-06-07 17:36:16 I'd rather they prevent gas companies from referring the cost of the carbon tax to the consumer. Carbon tax is inherently a good thing, but the oil companies should pay it, not the consumer.
2976 2018-06-07 17:36:09 $USDCAD #dollar down, #Oil Up. This should go to below 1.28 or even below 1.27 at this point. Wow. Why is this pair UP???

2984 2018-06-07 17:35:18 Let's say Venezuela no longer produces any oil, does the market really think there are no consequences? This will have a devastating impact from Colombia to Japan. And if Iran collapses that region will take a very hard hit.  Good job energy daytraders.  #oott
2985 2018-06-07 17:35:14 No. Yes.

2987 2018-06-07 17:34:55 Oil $75 barrel and petrol getting towards $2.00 litre thanks Turnbull
2988 2018-06-07 17:34:45 It’s because of the power of Gun/Arms industry/Oil cartel. They use the US administration to push their agenda: making wars, pulling out of deals( like Iran deal), sanctions, firing up conflicts around the world All create a larger marketplace for them, hence more profit!

3023 2018-06-07 17:31:33 If you replace the oil coming out of the Earth with gas coming out of the air then you stop introducing new carbon. It's not as good as permanently removing it but it's better than nothing.

3028 2018-06-07 17:31:06 You're not supposed to wash your everyday.
That only makes your scalp dry. That's why it's itchy.
Wash your hair at least once a week but I prefer every two weeks. 

What you should be doing is basing your scalp with things like avocado oil , castor oil and almond oil.
3029 2018-06-07 17:30:58 I'm not looking for friends.
I'm looking for traitors to the country I fought for.
You people are easy to find.
Snake oil's active ingredients won't allow you to just shut up.

3031 2018-06-07 17:30:54 Interesting....2030?  Doesn't look like oil will be a big winner by then...
Hopefully we will have found an alternative....then no more wars....
Just who has the biggest avocado....!
3032 2018-06-07 17:30:53 Can palm oil come from sustainable sources? I'm pretty sure it's in the ingredients of the organic peanut butter I sometimes get (but don't have in the house right now, so I can't check).

3037 2018-06-07 17:30:30 On a serious note, it's probably different cooking oil, different brands etc.
3038 2018-06-07 17:30:28 When you wash your hair, you strip it of its natural oils, causing your scalp to be dry. And then a dry scalp is what leads to having a itchy scalp. Base your scalp with hair food or hair product with lots of oil in it. It'll help doll 
3039 2018-06-07 17:30:20 You forget that hafter was party to the oil closing with jadran and they were allies until jadran went against him

3053 2018-06-07 17:29:03 You should stop buying products with palm oil which is nearly everything espacially in Nutella and or you can just look for products with eco friendly/ organic palm oil

3057 2018-06-07 17:28:54 Things I’ve managed to accomplish today:

Readjust my messy bun
dump teatree oil on some ants
pry a baby mouse out of my dogs mouth (it’s fine) 
eat some cottage cheese 

All without pants on. So, all in all...crushin it!
3058 2018-06-07 17:28:48 @witchbabysoap The Holy Smokes Body Oil is fabulous!  Earthy, exotic and completely 'witchy'!  I do hope that you will be making a full product line in that scent for the summer collection! 
3059 2018-06-07 17:28:47 Why would fuel lorries get gridlocked? Fuel is not imported/exported in lorries via Dover. There are numerous import terminals for refined oil products around the country that can accept from any country - not just EU. Why would fuel tank lorries be gridlocked in Op. Stack?
3060 2018-06-07 17:28:33 Even though it’s only my 3rd day out here, here are some things that I’ve learned about Italians so far:
-they hate subtitles
-Women live forever through the magic of olive oil
-lizards will gang up on birds to save themselves

3062 2018-06-07 17:28:22 No, actual educated people use the OECD as the developed peers to USA.

So yeah, we suck at adulting with guns.

3065 2018-06-07 17:28:17 I am by no means a dr or expert!!I was going to say St. John's wart helped me. After I had my son I had PPD & had horrible mood swings! once I starting taking fish oil supplements I felt so much better along w/getting rid of ALL processed foods!
3066 2018-06-07 17:28:16 What a media drenched sap you are.  In 40 years, did UK have to take the Euro?  You think they won't want our oil backed currency, not to mention our renewables, our food and drink?  We are progressive, want immigration etc.
3067 2018-06-07 17:28:09 it costed me $110 to get my oil change smh sometimes i really do hate driving a benz 
3068 2018-06-07 17:27:39 I need two tubes of Van Gogh oil paint. Alizarin crimson and ultramarine blue!

3070 2018-06-07 17:27:09 Coconut oil helps make it manageable
3071 2018-06-07 17:27:01 Just more evidence that American conservatism has simply become a market of gullible, scared people who are being preyed upon by modern snake oil sellers.
3072 2018-06-07 17:26:41 …and all so our oil'igarchs can accumulate more and more and more mammon by exploiting other countries' natural resources.
3073 2018-06-07 17:26:39 U use oil or butter?
3074 2018-06-07 17:26:34 Cooking some Marijuana is easy. Just put your pot in some hot grease and let it simmer. Once it has cooked good in the oil, drop an egg into it and cook it crisp. Place on toast and enjoy! Good high all day!
3075 2018-06-07 17:26:34 I feel dirty sometimes knowing Exxon paid for my college education and for my housing down payment while I'm getting a degree in enviro/business law to fight against the oil industry. It's irony at its finest.

3080 2018-06-07 17:26:11 Well shit then def try oil next on a cotton ball, it’s amazing
3081 2018-06-07 17:26:04 Nice loaded question. Other than placebo, they’re mostly worthless physiologically. But if you like modern snake oil, then have at it.

3084 2018-06-07 17:25:42 no it’s honestly so fire. now that you mention it maybe that’s why they’re so bomb. the oil. because they don’t taste like normal buttermilk ones they have a whole different flavor

3090 2018-06-07 17:25:15 yes.  US production way up thanks to tight oil (eg fracking)
3091 2018-06-07 17:25:05 That 'baby oil to remove tan' hack  is a load of bollocks I look like Tony the Tiger
3092 2018-06-07 17:25:05 Huh?  Are you looking at a different chart than I am?  It looks like a disaster.  Fracking boom has cut oil imports but actual manufactured goods deficit is huge & deteriorating.  I really don't see any good news there - all very bad trends except oil.
3093 2018-06-07 17:25:02 Vaseline is actually really good ! Maybe best to put on at bedtime tho ,or coconut oil xx

3098 2018-06-07 17:24:10 Truffle oil doesn’t belong on anything. It’s an abomination.
3099 2018-06-07 17:24:06 I'd say… we have become far too comfortable using taxpayer dollars to fund "security guards" for oil'igarchs all over the world. We need to ask this very hard question: is financing the exploitation of other countries' resources necessary to keep us safe?
3100 2018-06-07 17:24:05 Which reminds me, I was meant to book my car in for an oil change weeks ago.
3101 2018-06-07 17:23:54 @MrTireAuto my brother was ripped off by manager at the Amherst NY store. Quoted $182.59, and charged $203.58, tried to hide a misc $20.99 charge. Also charged for premium oil when it was never asked for, did not honor $15 oil change coup. Was going to return but NOT AGAIN.
3102 2018-06-07 17:23:54 is it bad to not change your oil for like over a year??? ...asking for a friend

3106 2018-06-07 17:23:12 You can bet they have factored that in already. Great idea. A lot has been learned in deep sea work in the oil fields. Great idea only if they are applying all that learning to the is venture. Could be the start of using ocean productively for energy.
3107 2018-06-07 17:22:57 I’m not the type to play like I don’t need a man for certain things. I’m not cutting no grass, im not hanging any massive pictures around the house. I’m not learning how to change oil or tires. My man can do it while I sit pretty.

3113 2018-06-07 17:22:09 Its funny Jerry Brown stands for environment when he used state agencies to explore his land for oil and gas love liberals only time they dont complain is when they have there hands in the cookie jar we let San Francisco dictate life here when the people there live in rot

3122 2018-06-07 17:20:56 Things are rarely just one thing. If I just wanted money, I would invest in donuts and warfare or oil companies. I want to change the world AND to get rich AF - crypto offers that path or at least the possibility of it.

Turkey is greedy for Iraq's oil and Iraq is greedy and unwilling to sell it to Turkey at a cheaper price, which Turkey feels they're due cuz they supply Iraq with all that water.

3189 2018-06-07 17:14:43 .... has fueled deforestation in parts of south east Asia, which is why we have set targets to ensure that the palm oil we use comes from sustainable sources. All palm oil and derivatives used as an ingredient in our own brand products must be sourced ........
3190 2018-06-07 17:14:24 Putting on sunscreen/tanning oil feels so goooood.
3191 2018-06-07 17:14:21 He was horrified when I put oil on
3192 2018-06-07 17:14:20 i put castor oil on my brows & lashes for like 2 weeks straight, everyday, & it made the process go by so much quicker!!
3193 2018-06-07 17:14:14 I have completed my first 72 hour mini fast! I could have gone tonight but fancied a small meal. I had wilted spinach and mushrooms fried in lots of avocado oil with a scrambled egg. Ate it before taking pic! Looked messy anyway #firstfast #fasting #fastingforhealth #gutcleanse
3194 2018-06-07 17:14:04 "Rosie" 6"x8" oil on canvas. Here is a recent puppy portrait that I did. I never thought I would paint as many pet portraits that I have done over the past year, but it's great to see how happy the client is when they pick their painting up, I love my job!

3196 2018-06-07 17:13:50 Better try innisfree greentea cleasing oil. Huhu. Biore not really recommended.
3197 2018-06-07 17:13:50 It’s time to stop these stupid wars.If we didn’t muck up the Middle East no terrorist would come here to fuck with us,it’s all reaction to stealing their oil/water/land/LIVES w/out apology. #NoMoreWar
3198 2018-06-07 17:13:41 the oil barons / vampyres hold our countries hostage due 2 oil and fuel demands,all this while they obliterate our oceans and estuaries with oil pollution,thank you 4rm us all 4 exposing these and many others xoxo
3199 2018-06-07 17:13:36 You aren't using those terms correctly in a poor attempt at insults.

5x? lol. Do you know how much these scientists make? Do you think funding from the gov is anywhere near funding from oil comps?

Use your brain. Come back.

3208 2018-06-07 17:12:55 It's so interesting how different we respond to products, I hope I did an ok job with the sunscreen recs. The Pyunkang feels insanely light to me unless I add oil or layer it over oil (my new method)
3209 2018-06-07 17:12:50 Hi Sarah, Morrisons are committed to the responsible sourcing of Palm Oil and also looks to use supply chain systems which minimise the environmental impact associated with the production of key commodities. The rising global demand for palm oil................
3210 2018-06-07 17:12:47 Uhh... This is, like, an oil field, right? Should we really be tossing explosives around?
3211 2018-06-07 17:12:39 It's our Amazonian clay full coverage foundation & new limited-edition maracuja gold oil 
3212 2018-06-07 17:12:31 So we are told to buy fruits, veggies, clothes made in Quebec to help the environement and the economy and jobs but it doesn’t apply for Oil and Gas ? eh boy
3213 2018-06-07 17:12:14 I need some ylang ylang and Rose hip oil
3214 2018-06-07 17:12:13 You know it Pard. Have to keep folks in oil so as to enjoy the lifestyle we all have become accustomed to
3215 2018-06-07 17:12:13 Just put new oil in my car never felt more manly
3216 2018-06-07 17:12:12 Mmmm you need more suntan oil let me help 
3217 2018-06-07 17:11:59 You're right - the truffle oil should be mixed into the mayonnaise which belongs on the fries.
3218 2018-06-07 17:11:58 What mathematics do we do as a country? Export crude oil then import refined oil...
Are we like Nigeria?
3219 2018-06-07 17:11:39 mine was an easy topic to make a presentation for tbh

we all gotta talk about whales and everyone got different topics about whales and mine is

3220 2018-06-07 17:11:38 Nemesis for President of the Boiler Room in 2020!

On second thought, no. That'd be like putting a pyromaniac in charge of an oil refinery.
3221 2018-06-07 17:11:18 @FearlessHeart higher dollar impacts the Brazilian index , the company’s bottom line and higher oil impacts the cost structure of airlines..
3222 2018-06-07 17:11:14 I know people with a high school education working on oil rigs making more and with better insurance than me as an example. There are plenty of opportunities for people who want them.
3223 2018-06-07 17:11:13 Or ever for that matter. No oil painting here

3225 2018-06-07 17:11:04 I usually start off telling them I don’t need any drill bits , grinding wheels, cut off wheels or penetrating oil, and then they are in a hurray to get off the line- you can push them on Milwaukee, they will beat anybody
3226 2018-06-07 17:11:03 10 onz of 00" flour, 15 g of fresh yeast, not the dried shit, 1 espresso cup of olive oil, salt, pinch of sugar to start de magic and 15 g of water, half of a espresso cup. Rest it's really easy and could be quite enjoyable.
Then 1h for the dough to rise.

3229 2018-06-07 17:10:27 Cooking oils such as butter and coconut oil are saturated and do not harden your cells allowing your body to metabolize sugar

3234 2018-06-07 17:10:17 July Soybean Oil in a very similar situation as meal with price extending through a demand zone at approx. the 30.65 price level.
3235 2018-06-07 17:10:14 WTI oil at $65.39/barrel, +$0.66.
3236 2018-06-07 17:10:10 Good! You’d be surprised how little dirt/oil/corrosion it takes to block a battery terminal from getting a good connection. Voltage could be just fine but put a load on it i.e. cranking and it won’t go. Glad to hear it’s OK

3238 2018-06-07 17:10:02 this guy at the oil change place swears up & down that last yr he serviced my mom, he seems like the type of guy that wouldn't lie about sex, or oil changes, so I believe him.
3239 2018-06-07 17:09:59 The #MiddleEast is emerging as an important demand center, contributing another 11% to incremental world #energy demand. In 2000, it consumed 20% of the #oil it produced, but that figure  now is only 32%. MidEast oil demand has enormous growth potential. #OOTT
3240 2018-06-07 17:09:55 hahaha yeah... but the Maserati is worth it. And I just won't tell my wife what an oil change costs for an Italian sports car
3241 2018-06-07 17:09:31 Yes, but the world is moving over very bloody slowly, with no sign yet of demand abating, and in Asia, just the opposite is happening. Supporting oil for awhile yet isn't about fear, it's about a more clear-eyed view of the Energy Transition than you lot.
3242 2018-06-07 17:09:28 Suzuki is the antithesis of what an honorary degree should represent. He is an activist, a bully and a politician - his days of research and science pursuit are far in his past. The Oil and Gas sector has contributed much to our province and the U of A, very shortsighted
3243 2018-06-07 17:09:28 I'm sharing this with you guys, because I'm taking this oil myself as well as starting my business here if anyone would like to join me and start their own business, its worldwide and 100% legal too.
3244 2018-06-07 17:09:21 Oil change
3245 2018-06-07 17:09:12 went just for an oil changed but ended up spending $400
3246 2018-06-07 17:08:56 It's all lies. I moved down a bracket. Make them perminant
3247 2018-06-07 17:08:40 Another great day to END #CANNABIS PROHIBITION FOR GOOD, & CREATE 50 MILLION NEW JOBS from this SINGLE RESOURCE.

3248 2018-06-07 17:08:35 Get some castor oil
3249 2018-06-07 17:08:32 They did, but remember Trump campaigned on giving people “better health care for less $”, and also not touching Medicaid. Basically promising the impossible to the gullible, like the snake oil salesman he is.

Reality has a funny way of checking people for their lies. 
3250 2018-06-07 17:08:31 Pls someone tell me how to stop stretch marks I’ve used bio oil for a few weeks now and it’s not helped at all and at this point will stop going gym cause can’t deal with it
3251 2018-06-07 17:08:20 Totally agree. Oil fans have less patience than other teams when a player is not living up to his contract.  Chia has to realize cutting bait is gonna be painful but it could only get worse in the long run.  Weigh every offer.  Take the one that hurts the least
3252 2018-06-07 17:08:20 When they start failing I hope there is a government in power to let them die.
  
Funnily.  Solar actually subsidizes oil and gas because they output less power then it takes to make them. Oil and Coal cover the short spread.
3253 2018-06-07 17:08:17 生きてて良いのか？
3254 2018-06-07 17:08:17 Hope you have plenty of beard oil with you.
3255 2018-06-07 17:08:03 you should try lavender oil i heard it helps that’s why i am trying it you should too!!

3257 2018-06-07 17:07:24 The only thing that weirds me out about pea milk is that it has oil in it. Sunflower oil.
3258 2018-06-07 17:07:24 Yup, not much leeway there!

And alas—I'd hoped to get pedantic about the content of ancient perfumes and suggest "scented oil." Scents in the Mediterranean are still produced in this way. If well-oiled bodies came up elsewhere, the departure might be justified... But nope. 
3259 2018-06-07 17:07:23 Avoid products with sulfates and silicones. I use OGX shampoo and conditioner. Castor oil and Wild Growth oil should be your best friend. And a spray bottle with water will make mad love to your hair. Remember that combs will destroy your hair pattern
3260 2018-06-07 17:07:17 Strong sunblock on the tanned parts (apply heavy) & tanning oil on the tankless parts.

3268 2018-06-07 17:06:26 Not bright for wanting a moderate, even if on the other side of the proverbial aisle, to hang around in the face of the oil money and Empower Texans-powered further right wing running around? Okaaaay...?
3269 2018-06-07 17:06:08 They’re just starting to build. They won’t go away. A kindly beekeeper might come and take them away.

3274 2018-06-07 17:05:41 1. CASTOR OIL 

-use a clean cotton swab or spoolie brush to apply the castor oil on the lash line and tips. 
-use this method on your eyelashes before you go to bed. 
-alternatively mix in some aloe vera gel and leave it on overnight. 
-you can also add vitamin E oil into it.

And

Saturn’s moon Titan has 300 times more liquid fuel than the total known oil reserves on Earth!
So no Crude Oil headache
3276 2018-06-07 17:05:37 There are process that we do not understand that have refilled old oil Wells. The theory was always that oil from elsewhere seeped in. Maybe this is a natural process by which oil is actually a renewable resource? It obviously isn't hard to do. Just say'n!
3277 2018-06-07 17:05:37 I had mine for a couple of months and had to take it out, I would recommend tea tree oil!! Helped with bumps and healing

These company’s are advocating this to make a profit. #PalmOil
3285 2018-06-07 17:04:11 $190 for oil change, cabin air filter, and air filter on Kelly's BMW. My GMC is so much cheaper to maintain.
3286 2018-06-07 17:04:00 Took my car in for an oil change.  Hmmn.  Right next to Costco.  Literally the same parking lot.  
3287 2018-06-07 17:03:55 I spilled some CBD oil on my table because I’m an idiot but I’m not a rich idiot so you best bet I licked that shit up. We don’t waste around here
3288 2018-06-07 17:03:51 Sounds amazing. No doubt the oil/automotive industry will do their utmost to prevent it.
3289 2018-06-07 17:03:49 Can Louisiana oil and sugar cane mix? About as well as the nouveau riche mingling with the upper crust. Daddy's girl tries to teach old friend how to fit in, but he's gonna teach her a few things about love.

3292 2018-06-07 17:03:36 Says more about Macron than Trump. Macron is a snake oil salesman, he just tried the same charm offensive with Putin. True friendship is not dependent in what you can get. It appears that's what Macron believes.

3304 2018-06-07 17:02:08 I helped set up and spud in a oil rig the year I got hurt in Kaplan Louisiana...home of Sammy Kershaw. #PottedMeat lol
3305 2018-06-07 17:02:04 I've had similar issues and I've found that putting olive oil on most of my meals will offset some of that craving as it's all calories (1oz is approx 120 cal) and good fat.
3306 2018-06-07 17:02:04 My house is built into a hill & the lawns are very stupid, I feel bad for the guys who have to mow them, but also can they not mow them right now?
I do have peppermint oil, that's a good thought.

3308 2018-06-07 17:01:45 Its nothing more than energy balance ..... thats it, nothing more ..... nothing less. Get parents to get kids out side and move more, portion control is also a big part. Everything has potential to damage your health .... tuna, kale.... even olive oil
3309 2018-06-07 17:01:44 I'm going to get an oil change does anyone need anything
3310 2018-06-07 17:01:38 Don't be ignorant although CA was attacked (oil tanks on coast) it was from a submarine off the coast. They never set foot on Mainland.
3311 2018-06-07 17:01:34 Google baby oil or mineral oil for ear wax. I've had to use this on my niece. It saves you a doctor's visit
3312 2018-06-07 17:01:14  Mine are slowly trickling in. Which is good because it keeps me from diving into several new things at once. 

I don’t know if I told you, but I ordered the Hadalabo Gokujyun hyaluronic acid cleansing oil. I’m almost out of the Kose so hopefully this will be gentle.

3317 2018-06-07 17:00:40 Oh, that looks painful! If you have any chamomile tea bags, you could try applying them - cold - to the inflamed areas. Lavender and or frankincense essential oil - as pure as you can get it - diluted with fractionated coconut oil, is very soothing. Hope you feel better soon!
3318 2018-06-07 17:00:40 You're quite welcome. Nothing like leather, burled walnut & gauges all around the dashboard. My dream car for the longest time was the 5.3 litre V12 Jag E-Type. A mechanic friend used to say that for a car to be properly British, it needed to leak oil. My Triumph did, too. &

One of many who will never be held to account for all of this. A Daily Mail rebrand would be good- but might be like trying to turn an oil tanker in a bathtub.
3325 2018-06-07 17:00:21 ARE CHEAP OIL CHANGES GOOD FOR THE CAR?

When planning to get an oil change, people always look for a cheaper option thinking it doesn’t make much difference.

3327 2018-06-07 17:00:03 Burning the MIDNIGHT OIL should never be for nothing but something totally worth!!! Don't do it if you won't do it...!!

No, him saying he doesn't think he has to prepare much isn't 88th dimensional chess. He ain't burning the midnight oil on this one.

3364 2018-06-07 16:55:54 Kind of a shame, California Democrats don't get it.  You have tons oil in California. Only cost this poor Texan $2.42 a gallon this morning.  How much is it costing you folks in Cali again?
3365 2018-06-07 16:55:40 Who benefits from an rise in oil prices? Russia. Which country apart from the US has almost gone to war with Iran recently? Israel. Which two countries invest a great deal in espionage? Russia and Israel.
3366 2018-06-07 16:55:22 Actually, it's helping coal and oil.  These plants can't compete price wise and employ far far less then the installation portion of the industry.

3373 2018-06-07 16:54:36 Wean away from oil.  Make quality goods to sustain inside the country.  This requires hard work and sacrifice.

3377 2018-06-07 16:54:06 That said if we are including one-timer winners into the equation, that 1983 Sixers squad was pretty darn special.
3378 2018-06-07 16:54:02 Anyone with common sense should know by now that promises are made to be broken.  Phasing out the oil sands in a forceful way can be acceptable to the stakeholders if you cover the capital and income losses of at least a trillion dollars. Expect the CAD to lose signifcant value.
3379 2018-06-07 16:53:42 Thank you, @JerseyCityFord for the quote of the day. "We might've taken 5 hours to change your oil/breaks this week, and #Sync shouldn't have been touched. Weird it's not working, but might take your full Saturday to have it looked at."

Is this real life?
3380 2018-06-07 16:53:35 Similarly, but through distance of time, coal *is* solar.  Oil *is* solar.  Hydro is solar. Even nuclear energy is solar, from the death rattle of another star.  #RenewThis
3381 2018-06-07 16:53:33 Where am I gonna get coconut oil? 
3382 2018-06-07 16:53:30 jesus girl how long did you go without an oil change 
3383 2018-06-07 16:53:25 Man told me today," I watched the OK governors forum last night on TV that the oil companies put on.  They said that the oil companies were having to pay for the tax credits on the wind farms. "

3386 2018-06-07 16:53:16 The moment when mechanics make recommendations is so uncomfortable. Get my oil changed and he could say

“Hey so your car is actually about to explode want us to fix that while were in there?” 

And id still probably go “oh no it’s okay um just an oil change today”
3387 2018-06-07 16:53:13 That's a good one, SSE Airtricity who tell us they get their energy from renewables like wind are increasing their prices for electricity. The reason: Oil prices are rising!! #GoFigure @IvanYatesNT #ntfm #WTF
3388 2018-06-07 16:53:10 Surely the population of 5.3 m vs 65m has something to do with how far the oil wealth goes.

Not sure if the comparison really stands.
3389 2018-06-07 16:53:05 And then allows mining and oil companies to dump shit into the ocean.
3390 2018-06-07 16:53:00 HAHA What? That would be nuts!

3397 2018-06-07 16:52:28 Trump is always rewriting history-imagining his crowd size is the biggest in history-now-creating his own version of events-ignoring fact for fiction-exaggerating-fabricating-hallucinating-creating his own narrative-
In short-TRUMP IS A SNAKE OIL CON ARTIST-
3398 2018-06-07 16:52:25 I dont support companies using child labour or palm oil - Ben and Jerrys is a double whammy on those two (at the same time). 

I guess however for progressives it will be a case of 'do what I say, not what I do'.

Enjoy your ice-cream sweeten by exploited child labour.

3403 2018-06-07 16:52:09 Thanks for reminding us to just FOLLOW THE MONEY!  It’s going to be revealed that Cohen tried and probably did collect on brokering the Rosneft oil sale.  Like Trump gives a rat’s ass about Qatar.  He only helped them to collect a commission.

3405 2018-06-07 16:51:57 What has the Tories ever done for Scotland? Well they closed down the shipyards & Steel works for a start. They squandered Scotland’s oil reserves. Took our money & spent it on their own buisness interests in London. Does this count as Tory Love

3407 2018-06-07 16:51:50 And your last statement is the big difference. I never viewed any of the Heat or Cavs teams that won among the best teams of all-time. In my lifetime, I'd say the only teams that enter into that discussion are the Warriors, Jordan's Bulls, Magic's Lakers and Bird's Celtics.
3408 2018-06-07 16:51:37 Happy Oil

3458 2018-06-07 16:46:22 Well its a good thing they are making the harbor deeper --  it will need to be deeper to allow for all the oil rig traffic that "CALL ME JEFF" duncan and the other lackeys from SC are going to allow of the coast of SC>

3460 2018-06-07 16:46:03 Becuz many furnace oil based govt and private power plants having efficiency ranging 12 to 20% have been closed in favor of newly installed highly efficient ( greater than 50%). More such inefficient plants will closed in near future.
3461 2018-06-07 16:45:57 Makes a ton of sense in the post-FB scandal era. But still such a hard sell to private transportation co's in the current 'data is the new oil' era.
3462 2018-06-07 16:45:47 @RachelNotley Rachel be honest about the pipeline.  You are being proactive because Mr Kenney embarrassed you into it.  There are plenty of videos with you speaking against pipelines and oil and gas industry.
3463 2018-06-07 16:45:42 Isn't that the truth!! The reason I started is my father had heart surgery about 15yrs ago. The #2 heart surgeon in the world told him to stay away from hydrogenated oil and cornsyrup. Started looking at almost everything in the store and found it even in Cheese(makes it melt
3464 2018-06-07 16:45:40 Sinus headache that might be a migraine. #Naturopathic friends, help. What can I do besides peppermint oil? Ya girl is really not trying to take any more pills than normal.
3465 2018-06-07 16:45:31 800 tons of pure mineral oil is undoubtedly effective ... but wouldn’t 800 tons of chocolate #pudding be more fun? #STEM
3466 2018-06-07 16:45:30 Check your Transmission oil this afternoon.
3467 2018-06-07 16:45:28 None! Not like coconut oil.
3468 2018-06-07 16:45:23 there was a store like that in Worcester, MA called SPAGS. 

literally the motor oil was next to the Vagisil. Good lord indeed.
3469 2018-06-07 16:45:14 Agreed that Mavs team was a well-oiled machine.
3470 2018-06-07 16:45:03 Whenever I get an oil change they always conveniently try to tack on $500 of EXTRA work for me to pay for. My oil change is $50.... isn't that enough!!!  boy bye 
3471 2018-06-07 16:44:48 Free oil change and car wash. Productive morning so far 
3472 2018-06-07 16:44:43 For your face I highly recommend SHEA BUTTER but only the natural unrefined one. Your skin will thank you. I use palmers coconut oil before I moisturize my body to lock in the moisture
3473 2018-06-07 16:44:43 Please find some climate change engineers who can plot out a transition path, from oil to environmentally safe energy, in which we can create new jobs, surplus energy, and maintain our economic levels at the same time. It can be done.
3474 2018-06-07 16:44:41 You can certainly credit Trump for the "Iran problem." 

When they couldn't manage to get their sanctions lifted, having Trump back out of the Iran deal was Russia's plan b. It put greater dependence on Russian oil.

3478 2018-06-07 16:44:18 Vote against this with you money. Stop buying palm oil and lessen your intake of meat and dairy products. They’re simple acts of kindness towards animals and this planet. 
3479 2018-06-07 16:44:17 There’s actually a lot you can do to help them. Lessen your meat and dairy intake and cut palm oil out of your diet. It makes a huge difference and is easy to do day to day. 
3480 2018-06-07 16:44:13 Dude, coconut oil is the shit. Use it everywhere you want.

3482 2018-06-07 16:43:56 And the paint and turpentine and oil it takes to make a painting is toxic. (Substitutes for turpentine, lead white are inferior). Without art, culture, we are less than animals.
3483 2018-06-07 16:43:52 Why are the leaders/courts siding with the muslims? I am talking about the 30,000 ft. view, like "they want for more oil for the country" or "they want more investments from muslims" ... i would guess it would have to be big time that would cause them to turn against Britain's!
3484 2018-06-07 16:43:41 NbcNews/WSJ poll: trump approval at 44% from perceived boost in the economy. Wait till you have to pay for the 1.5 T in tax cuts for millionaires & corporations, trade wars roll out, & price of oil goes up because of uncertainty in middle east. Nothing a good ole war couldnt fix.
3485 2018-06-07 16:43:40 if anyone would like to help me get my oil changed PLS send me money:( my cash app is: okjustine12
3486 2018-06-07 16:43:36 Most popular page request at the @foodcoop these days is CBD oil.
3487 2018-06-07 16:43:29 Oil from Turkana will be exported in crude & imported back to the country as  finished products. Just like coffee & Tea. This is cheaper to the country for now.
3488 2018-06-07 16:43:28 What's the strange movements that Rajdeep has in front of the camera? Is it a cockroach in his pants or is it a lizard in his pants? And, what is that expression on his face? Has he consumed castor oil or has he tasted semen? Absolutely quirky and nauseating!
3489 2018-06-07 16:43:20 It's also super expensive to live there now. The same thing happened there when we had the Eagle Ford oil shale boom, which has pretty much died down and most of the drivers were laid off. But for many this is a great opportunity to make a lot of money.
3490 2018-06-07 16:43:12 there was no oil at all lmfao, oil warning light came on as soon as i was picked up in Sheffield, probs at LAN for 8 now given traffic and technical difficulties 
3491 2018-06-07 16:43:09 Better than me, waiting to get oil changed and the girls are raging to the drums in fall out boys flying and menace......11 times in a row and counting...
3492 2018-06-07 16:42:59 Nymex wti crude oil Best  SELLING  level NEARLY  between  $66.35 to $66.75  sl $67.45  target $66.05/$65.75/$65.55/$65.05
3493 2018-06-07 16:42:52 allowing coal companies to dump unfettered waste, denying climate change, not doing research on pollutants, opening up national parks for oil and gas exploitation, putting high tariffs on solar panels
3494 2018-06-07 16:42:46 The Fix is in and always has been with the left wing California Voters!

Kids, Illegals and even the Dead are voting for them?

3496 2018-06-07 16:42:38 I know that coconut oil is good for humans. I never heard that it is good for dogs, too. But why not? Now...how do you administer it?

3499 2018-06-07 16:42:21 2008 was also the year gasoline hit its highest one-day price ever -- $4.11 per gallon in July. At the time, a red-hot global economy and fears over dwindling supplies were some of the factors that sent both gas and oil prices to their highest level ever.Dec 31, 2012
CNN money.
3500 2018-06-07 16:41:57 Ding ding ding on em lol yessss ! There’s a special oil (gotta remember the name), but for the texture i think there’s a special kind of cloth - i was thinking about doing mine soon too so I’ll let you know or we can experiment together lol

3502 2018-06-07 16:41:26 This is what Trump wanted! His oil will go up & we will pay him more for it. Trump will now get to deal directly with Russia, his real country, & give USA right over to Putin. This is a mess & Trump is a corrupt Traitor who should be removed from WH and taken to prison!
3503 2018-06-07 16:41:24 I accidentally put on my job interview and business oil on my wrist yesterday 2 hours before work and smoke a black before walking in my manager stop in the middle of telling me something to say I smell good 
3504 2018-06-07 16:41:19 How's the oil look? Black or horrible creamy?
3505 2018-06-07 16:41:10 Hey   meghaan .  Well  let me tellyou that I am  a trucktrailer diesel mechanic you know all that stuf grease . Oil  hands dirty ....  How is your tv show going?
3506 2018-06-07 16:40:47 1. Although my 401k is holding steady, it is no longer increasing in value. I was seeing a 15-20% return for approx 4 yrs.  2. Gas prices and home heating oil (used to heat my water, too) are way up.  3. Open hate and hostility toward gays, immigrants, ppl of color are rampant.

3508 2018-06-07 16:40:36 It is not a new thing to use nationalism as a cover for Tory tactics. The SNP won so many seats that the only way forward is down. They are desperate to prove that Scotland's income is enough to survive on and it is not when oil prices are down.
3509 2018-06-07 16:40:34 At #bostonclimatesummit @nationalgridus CEO Dean Seavers says their priorities are converting heating from oil to natural gas & electrification, decarbonzing the electric grid & electrifying transportation.
3510 2018-06-07 16:40:33 i love the smell of frying onions in olive oil.
3511 2018-06-07 16:40:18 I probably should have fixed this when I changed my oil and serpentine belt this past weekend, but I forgot, and it started leaking last night, so I had to use the plug kit this morning before work...

3514 2018-06-07 16:39:51 If we had extended the existing rail line from Kitale to Turkana and beyond, the cost and time for transporting the newly found crude oil would be much less. Instead we chose to eat!

3517 2018-06-07 16:39:38 East Duvernay. $7mm per well with 350bbl/d oil getting lots of love.

Charlie Lake. $3mm per well with 350bbl/d oil getting some love. 

I do love EDVNY potential, just think it’s over hyped at the moment.
3518 2018-06-07 16:39:34 Your oil cap has fallen off
3519 2018-06-07 16:39:25 Sorry Oilers fans but Lucic being open to a deal and him actually being moved are two totally different things. If things continue to go in the wrong direction, playing in Edmonton would be place a player in Milan's spot would like to avoid.

3545 2018-06-07 16:36:36 In oil in gas the state forces us to report our well production after six months. Well data all becomes public record. It’s of great benefit to all operators when we all have to do it, but would fail miserably if on a volunteer basis. The info helps us all improve recovery.

3547 2018-06-07 16:36:33 I think Pruitt is still there because 
1. Donald likes that he's dismantling the agency that oil/gas/coal hates 
2. While were talking about all the shitty things that Pruitt does, we're not talking about Trump's election/moneylaundering collusion with Russia
3548 2018-06-07 16:36:33 Get rid of coal and retrain their workers.... Get rid of oil and get rid of the billonaire strangelhold on our economy.....

3555 2018-06-07 16:35:49 For some reason coconut oil man keeps putting Kingery in the #3 spot. Regardless he's hitting .188 there and a cool .212 on the year. Last 7 games he's hitting .174 so it's not like he's heating up. At least he's got Pivetta hitting 9th today. #PHIvsCHC
3556 2018-06-07 16:35:37 Are those straws that you put in the bottles and then what do you fill them up with? I know there still a little essential oil in the bottle.
3557 2018-06-07 16:35:32 You mean in the same way that if we just ignore the First Amendment, we can establish an official religion?

3561 2018-06-07 16:35:04 This is all bull. They want a war. Very soon you'll start seeing them turn-up the heat on Iran, plus it raises oil prices, win-win.
3562 2018-06-07 16:34:59 What we need is electric rail along the Sea to Sky. Safer and lets people get around without oil.
3563 2018-06-07 16:34:54 Yeah you gotta use a carrier oil. Essential oils are highly concentrated. You could add it to water and make a spray also.
3564 2018-06-07 16:34:54 GAS prices sky high! Experts warned Trump’s withdrawal from the Iran Deal could cause the loss of 500,000 barrels of oil a day on the global market, skyrocketing oil prices.

Gas prices up 80 cents, expected to hit $6 in some areas.

HURTS average Americans!

3568 2018-06-07 16:34:27 What’s the difference between a “subcontractor” and a “business”? Is the BLS not accurately counting my dentist because my insurance company pays her? Is the BLS not accurately counting my mechanic because I subcontract oil changes to them instead of doing it myself?

3573 2018-06-07 16:33:49 girl ify!!! but ive been removing my makeup with coconut oil and makeup wipes before i sleep and let whatever oil is left on my face sink in at night & in the morning ive been washing my face w either cetaphil or black african soap and i promise its working

3575 2018-06-07 16:33:39 My skins clearing up rlly well now I’m so happy, like last week I was drowning my face in tea tree oil and doing like 2 face masks a day n literally didn’t leave the house without a full face, go me :))))))

2~ Limit sun exposure 

3~ Don’t pinsh your skin 

4~ Always remove makeup when going to sleep 

5~ Eat less oil and butter

3578 2018-06-07 16:33:18 Loss of weight in water or more loss of weight in oil or most loss of weight in mercury the book say. There is no loss of weight. If there was loss of weight human sud look like with skin and bones in water & like leaf in mercury accordingly loss of weight, but weight is constant
3579 2018-06-07 16:33:18 WASHINGTON: A day before Trump withdrew from Iran deal, US called Saudi Arabia to ask them to help keep oil prices stable if Iran disrupted supply. (Reuters)
3580 2018-06-07 16:33:13 What’s important is to use palm oil from sustainable sources - most producers will say whether or not they do this. Palm is a very efficient crop, and moving to other sources (like coconut) will actually create MORE deforestation. Insist on sustainable palm!!
3581 2018-06-07 16:33:13 My hair soaks up whatever you put in it so moisturizing shampoos, conditioners, and deep conditioners are the way to go. Then a serum for the blonde hair, a good oil and a creamy leave in
3582 2018-06-07 16:33:07 Actually that’s what happens when you get an anti oil socialist party to run the place. Raising taxes and red tape have caused investment in the Oilsands to almost become obsolete.
3583 2018-06-07 16:33:06 Late morning trade: NATGAS 15M historically tests 50MA, holds & confirms, then higher. WATCH 
SPX 15M sets up bullish candle pattern, melt up/grind higher by afternoon.
USD & GOLD hold corellation, but USD price action stalls.
OIL 15M in "bullish consolidation" 3rd leg up. WATCH

12 oz coconut water (you might need to use part of this and blend down some ingredients to make room for more to go in.  I do.)
I also add 60 grams of protein powder (vanilla) but that would be optional
Also 3 servings of the MCT oil

3596 2018-06-07 16:31:47 when the oil companies go out of business, we will have to form new companies to clean up after them, so we need fear no unemployment.

3604 2018-06-07 16:30:58 I tell myself that I hate funko-pops for ecosocialist reasons but really it's just because they disrespect the source designs and The Good Smile Company turns oil into geegaws so much better
3605 2018-06-07 16:30:54 Thank you firestone, I needed my oil change today not tomorrow, seems like every time I do business with them something happens

3616 2018-06-07 16:29:33 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.

3618 2018-06-07 16:29:28 My, my, only 20? Obviously the rest of Albertans must like David Suzuki. He's a Canadian institution, always looking out for the planet. Honestly, do these people actually 'like' oil spills?

3626 2018-06-07 16:27:57 Almost no brands of truffle oil actually use real truffles. It is an artificial flavor and is nothing like a fresh shaved truffle, white or black variety.

3643 2018-06-07 16:26:16 It won’t happen whilst the oil industry has such a big market. They won’t let it happen they’ll drill in the Arctic guarantee it

3656 2018-06-07 16:24:53 Yeah I should get some. I keep seeing nasal saline spray for nasal hay fever but feel like it’s a tenner for snake oil.
3657 2018-06-07 16:24:44 aku pake face oil juga prosesnya ga cepet kok, tapi berangsur angsur ada perubahan. tp aku pake haple btw. coba di pake sampe sebulanan, biasanya baru mulai keliatan.
3658 2018-06-07 16:24:43 I read a report about 10 years ago how Palm oil is also toxic to the nervous system, something they've been covering up.
3659 2018-06-07 16:24:20 @JoelEmbiid How you feeling on this lovely Thursday afternoon my guy?
3660 2018-06-07 16:24:19 Ummm, have you ever seen his TV show? It is rife with pseudoscience, quackery, woo and bullshit. So yeah—he was definitely on board with the content of that tweet even if he didn’t type it himself. @DrOz is a snake oil salesman.
3661 2018-06-07 16:23:48 I’ve not heard of CBD oil what is It?
3662 2018-06-07 16:23:46 Haha yeah it’s a really approachable fish, and quite versatile. Smoked salmon 

Coconut oil for the medium chain triglycerides  Plus the flavor is bomb.

3664 2018-06-07 16:23:38 that's why shady formulas are used in fuel oil gas prices. We should stop paying tax till they give info and CHANGE. No more shit
3665 2018-06-07 16:23:34 Could we not have mitigated such increases with the use of the Strategic Fuel Funds (SFF) basically using those oil reserves to curb the increase or am I hogging up the wrong tree? @JohnPerlman @kayafm95dot9

3670 2018-06-07 16:22:38 Our job is like telling people to change the oil in their car yet for some reason people view patching differently and then dont understand why the engine busts into flames and hops out of the car with cylinders flying

3676 2018-06-07 16:21:42 Almond oil is one of the greatest things I've ever used in my life
3677 2018-06-07 16:21:32 Ok friends, help me out. I'm writing an op ed style piece with a colleague. I want the lede to be an everyday example of when people make incorrect conclusions from the wrong data. Not wrong interpretations, but the data. Like looking at washer fluid to see if oil is low. Ideas?
3678 2018-06-07 16:21:24 พูดด้วยก็ไม่ฟังอีก ทีหลังจะได้รู้ว่าไม่ควรพูด
3679 2018-06-07 16:21:20 Once I'd thought about migrating to North Dakota to seek opportunities in the oil fields, research showed temperature fall to minus 40°C: once I was in kinangop mid morning not a cloud in sight but my body was shivering worse than a drill bit. anyway hata sina valid passport.
3680 2018-06-07 16:20:53 Donald Junior II is now under the oil lit lights in Dad's studying how "He is simply/going to get/to the bottom of pediatrics and to hell with the surgeon who will get their chance at redemption in the next life.

3681 2018-06-07 16:20:52 Thi use almond oil (shout-out to @coldestwinters ) and argan oil, and the Neutrogena hydrating masks are ok... But too much outside of that
3682 2018-06-07 16:20:42 Yeah, let's go find some more resources to exploit off planet, 'cause we managing our resources here so damn well.  Bezos should buy the Arctic Wildlife Refuge and permanently protect it from the greedy oil crazed corporations who want us to drive ourselves to Armageddon.
3683 2018-06-07 16:20:35 Did he hit some oil? Kind of looks like he did.
3684 2018-06-07 16:20:29 Yeah can imagine cause they probably lose attention so fast. Gg haha not familiar with mandarin at all the kid. Yeah oil refinery  bath in petrol
3685 2018-06-07 16:20:27 Mehmet Oz is a snake oil salesman
3686 2018-06-07 16:20:22 Hey! I have the same issue. It clears up better if I ignore it. Stress makes it worse, for sure. No picking. My face is so bad because of that! Those are things that really help. The only thing I ever advise is using oil remover wipes. Those also have helped me
3687 2018-06-07 16:20:17 Trump’s admin will certainly not address this issue as oil is used to make plastic & Koch Bros are 1 of R’s biggest campaign contributors. It will take change to Dem’s & individual states to get rid of as much plastic as possible
3688 2018-06-07 16:20:10 Its close to being a thing bud. Canada holds three solid cards that literally crush the US if played, fresh water, wheat/grain, and oil. If we tariff water or grain to the US and ship elsewhere, the US will find living allot more expensive and allot less free.
3689 2018-06-07 16:20:06 and how exactly will that lizard get rid of that oil? genius, lmao
3690 2018-06-07 16:20:01 And who cares where the raw ingredients come from for solar? They are long term products. They extract valuable free solar energy and can be recycled at end of life. As long their energy lifetime cost is cheaper than energy from coal and oil, they will win. Solar is winning.
3691 2018-06-07 16:19:52 since none of y'all wanted to do my oil change I'm bout to YouTube this shit DIY oil change 
3692 2018-06-07 16:19:44 A pea-sized amount of baby oil can act as a shine hair serum before dashing out the door.
3693 2018-06-07 16:19:28 Problems never finish, eve in America, UK and Germany, they still have problems, if problems of nigeria can be solved in 4yrs,we won't be here, obasanjo's 8yrs,lost but found brothers nearly 6yrs would have cleared our problems, particularly with oil selling at $100 average.
3694 2018-06-07 16:19:23 @solangeknowles look like she always covered in coconut oil she is the most fashionable of all time
3695 2018-06-07 16:19:23 So much for running out of oil.
3696 2018-06-07 16:19:20 Oil Change was an underrated album from them.
3697 2018-06-07 16:19:19 Of course they are thanks to trump and then snake oil salesman will come out with a plan that will barely cover you but provide lots to insurance and drug companies but making it seem like youcare paying less.
3698 2018-06-07 16:19:18 You are trying to be realistic Andrew & kudos to you but change has to begin before we lose too much. "Oil" is precious & can be put to much better use than being burned. Right now it's a grab and dash, Canadians asked to bear the brunt of the greedy 1%, any jobs will be fleeting
3699 2018-06-07 16:19:14 この程度のキルを撮りなさいw
3700 2018-06-07 16:19:11 Ouch! Does that mean no oil change today? Seriously... I hope it heals quickly. Hugs
3701 2018-06-07 16:19:10 Vending machines that make French Fries was always my dream. Just an oil change once per week.

3703 2018-06-07 16:18:49 I feel like the coconut oil is only good for ingrown hairs and stuff. I don’t think it does anything for yeast infections. ACV is great but still... I don’t think anything actually works. Trial and error. Garlic??? NEVER. EVER 
3704 2018-06-07 16:18:44 Someone in NGO career told me their is a sudden flurry of donor projects coming up in Turkana. *cough* oil *

3706 2018-06-07 16:18:27 Pure speculation here on my part. Would Doug Weight take a head coaching position in junior hockey? More specifically, would he be open to coaching the Oil Kings?

3712 2018-06-07 16:17:49 Or buy african grown palm oil! That's where it originally came from and African palm oil is grown on centuries old plantations, not in heavily populated rainforest ecosystems.

3719 2018-06-07 16:17:16 really want the hl oil cleanser :(
3720 2018-06-07 16:17:09 Take your heels off, get into the down and dirty, into the oil field, mechanics, climb an electrical pole, construction, crime scene clean up, etc. Buy a pair of steel toes, leather gloves. My kids make excellent money in 2 of those fields and ones a girl.
3721 2018-06-07 16:17:09 My utility provider didn't cut rates, they are raising them. I'm paying more for food because of rising oil prices. and no big bonus only $8.00 after taxes increase in weekly take home pay. Thanks so much
3722 2018-06-07 16:16:57 All of this was debunked by Rep Lujan’s questions especially on methane.  We can’t keep ignoring the environment in the name of oil and at expense of alternative/clean energy
3723 2018-06-07 16:16:52 Risks to Equities 

Rising Oil prices

3734 2018-06-07 16:15:44 Lol there is no guarantee that Enron would clean up the spill.

An oil spill in Burrard Inlet would put at risk industries, including tourism, real estate & agriculture, that together employ over 200,000 people. It would hurt our $17B tourism industry. 

It's asinine to expand KM

3750 2018-06-07 16:14:30 Iran constructed a nuclear facility in less than a month? That was fast. Or maybe they were working on it all along and ignoring the deal.  Higher oil prices mean we may finally be forced to invest in alternative fuels, leading to a greener planet.

3756 2018-06-07 16:13:41 How about spending billions on a private oil pipeline to ship low quality tar oil that no one wants to buy, and which the people of Canada most oppose?
3757 2018-06-07 16:13:40 Its a machine; constructed to do exactly what it was designed to do. Obama and Trump just oil/oiled the engine; gas station attendants - at best. The problems this machine causes too many, are offset by the prosperity offered to a few - that can afford the finest hypnotists.
3758 2018-06-07 16:13:36 Also, the rest of Canada said no to pipelines and your dirty #Tarsands. Dirty oil will not help the economies of BC, Alberta, and Canada. David Susuki deserves the degree and protesters need to stop whining and accept it. #bcpoli #abpoli #cdnpoli #StopKM #StopPipelines

3778 2018-06-07 16:11:59 Peppermint oil smells better and seems to help to.  A few of those essential oils the women are going crazy for actually have their uses. I just rub a drop or two on my hands and them breath through them.

3781 2018-06-07 16:11:45 Crude oil is not determinant for an economy's performance.

3793 2018-06-07 16:10:59 Jame Hansen's argument is similar. We aren't capable of extracting all the oil sands and thanks to new technologies it is not one of the dirtiest, most carbon-intensive fuels on the planet". Not even close. That is unsupported hyperbole and demonstrably wrong 4/

3812 2018-06-07 16:09:19 McKibben's argument about burning all the oil sands is simply a joke. We lack the technological capacity to extract most of that material. Just because it exists doesn't mean we can extract it. McKibben throws this factoid out regularly and no serious observer listens 3/
3813 2018-06-07 16:09:06 The oil and gas industry in Canada is not "subsidized".  To the contrary -- this industry has the highest effective tax rate of any sector.

*OPEC deal expires at year-end. Still to be seen whether it is extended
*US continues to improve technology, increases production and reduces breakeven prod. prices

Hahahhahaha
3872 2018-06-07 16:05:27 Girls pls be humble, because no matter how beautiful you are, your parent will still exchange you for a goat/cow, a bag of rice and some tubers of Yam, palm oil and Kola nuts ‍
3873 2018-06-07 16:05:26 These acts make demons enter your home it won't take anointing oil to remove that demon when you beat up a guy to death for your mother it will take prayers a blood covenant is very hard to remove
3874 2018-06-07 16:05:24 Which right was that?
3875 2018-06-07 16:05:12 He needs some Oil of Olay.
3876 2018-06-07 16:05:04 Richest country in the history of the world? Hahahaha I think there are a few oil rich middle eastern countries that would beg to differ, and they aren’t $20 trillion in debt either! Idiot
3877 2018-06-07 16:05:02 EVOO EVOO EVOO ... *extra virgin olive oil 
3878 2018-06-07 16:05:02 I need a oil change 
3879 2018-06-07 16:04:59 no it’s not oil based
3880 2018-06-07 16:04:57 but hypothetically, if you were POTUS and got a secret stake in Russian oil giant Rosneft, then this spike in oil prices would be winning, right ? @SethAbramson
3881 2018-06-07 16:04:53 早いね
3882 2018-06-07 16:04:36  nah coconut oil get expensive
3883 2018-06-07 16:04:31 You know ‘bad hair days’? Yeah well I’m having like a bad FACE day. Like cool, I woke up with some zits on my lip and chin and there’s facial hair in my peripheral view because I didn’t oil or brush today my beard this morning.
3884 2018-06-07 16:04:29 Makan madu + fish oil + olive oil. Bdn letih gila 
3885 2018-06-07 16:04:22 someare soft/oil pastel, some are oil paint, some are charcoal and one is pencil!!
3886 2018-06-07 16:04:15 "Challenges like Canada's PM buying an oil pipeline when he knows that was exactly the wrong thing to do…"
3887 2018-06-07 16:04:10 Watch @emirates turns inhuman to save a buck:
Turns #FirstClass ticket holders windows into fake screenshot windows instead... Just to convince lower class riders that an LED-sunset is more "luxury" than a 10,000 ft sunset. Cheap. And inhuman.#pods #business #WallSt #finance #Oil

3890 2018-06-07 16:03:49 Truck drivers in Midland are making $140k by delivering oil from the Permian!!
3891 2018-06-07 16:03:42 Me hungry but on my travels. Went into M&S Food to find some keto food. What hadn't had sugar added was in sunflower oil! Opted for 100g salmon flakes. Tiny bit of sugar added in smoking.
3892 2018-06-07 16:03:35 made myself a drink and what I thought was lime cordial turned out to be sunflower oil.This rock n roll lifestyle will be the death of me.
3893 2018-06-07 16:03:35 At this point, it's better to have the SDF control those areas while making some sort of deal with Assad to share the gas and oil, because the Turks will just take everything and will not leave cc anything for Syrians or Kurds.
3894 2018-06-07 16:03:28 I think it would be a huge mistake for so many reasons. But greed will put. Hedge fund owners and oil billionaires less concerned with glory when compared to £.
3895 2018-06-07 16:03:13 Without oil there is no Libya. When Haftar took over the oil crescent in Sep 2016 and handed it over to the NOC no questions asked and oil started pumping next day, Haftar demonstrated (to some dismay in east) deference to that principle. Oil has flowed since without stopping.

3898 2018-06-07 16:03:02 OROGO is at the Explorer Hotel from 10 am to 7 pm today to answer your questions about oil and gas regulation during the REDI session.
3899 2018-06-07 16:02:34 Dear Olive Oil, you're either a Virgin or you are not. 
There's no such thing as "Extra Virgin", Ok?! 
3900 2018-06-07 16:02:01 I just want to go to the beach and put tanning oil so I can get that cute tan. With some cute shades and a sun hat eating ceviche with a margarita. Is that too much too ask?
3901 2018-06-07 16:01:58 tiny bit of olive oil....
3902 2018-06-07 16:01:58 Why does he need to slum it at the WH dining hall?  I'm sure that there are some oil lobbyists just lining up to take him out ?
3903 2018-06-07 16:01:53 .A nice restored Patio Table topped with recycled timber with a Rye Oil finish.  £65.00
3904 2018-06-07 16:01:34 The most common fuel used in boilers is?natural gas, followed by?heating oil, and occasionally liquid petroleum gas (?LPG)
3905 2018-06-07 16:01:34 I think bombing hospitals, people in other lands for oil to be a hard line view. Along with Windrush, Grenfell, NHS cuts and allowance of offshore tax havens. I don’t think working for a supermarket owned by a tax cheating owner to be hard line or a principle point.
3906 2018-06-07 16:01:33 Whole flower cannabis is also much more cost effective for the patients. Current products are costly due to the production process and materials.

You can also extract the medical properties into butter or oil at home with whole flower cannabis for oral use.
3907 2018-06-07 16:01:32 413 are crude oil. Mind you, we’re not done yet but we’ve covered most of them.

This binch
3911 2018-06-07 16:01:04 Your reading Haftar's rhetoric, Im reading the whole situation. I dont see any contract of consensus in the arab world only contracts of dominance/servitude. Im hoping we as Libyans, after this war, can have a real rights based social contract by using oil to cure conflict curse
3912 2018-06-07 16:00:50 I thought beans was disgusting till i tried Boiled beans and Palm oil stew!!!  Now i know Beans is bae!!
3913 2018-06-07 16:00:40 Rival robots, Betty and Buzz are paired up for the Science Fair and somehow must oil a few screws to work together and win first prize. #PitMad #PB
3914 2018-06-07 16:00:32 Oil be wanting proof.
3915 2018-06-07 16:00:31 Don’t be alarmed if you see me losing weight. I pat down my pizza with a napkin to remove the oil & I now eat 2 bowls of cereal instead of 3
3916 2018-06-07 16:00:30 It was released to critical historiography, but they are called "product wax" (or "press wax" ) and "foots oil".
3917 2018-06-07 16:00:24 I'm big into oil. I own lots of it and I know what it smells like. It's rich smelling. The smell itself spawns property and mansions.
3918 2018-06-07 16:00:24 Herbal Essence has been my jam lately it smells good my hair drinks it and becomes so soft and it’s affordable.ORS coconut oil is the loml. Mixed chicks leave in cond. is good but the smell is not for the culture.Jamaican castor oil for your scalp is a great choice.
3919 2018-06-07 16:00:19 That war memorial building that looked like a borstal 
3920 2018-06-07 16:00:17 After I lost my company and the government cleaned me out , I started in the bar and restaurant business,and I don’t have the patience for this no more , so back on the oil industry:) , take the money and run!
3921 2018-06-07 16:00:10 Tax bill has not benefited anyone. In fact, the increase in insurance premiums, thanks to Trump, is far higher than the $12 per month in take home pay. He’s a snake oil salesman and you’re buying his product. I’m not.

3925 2018-06-07 15:59:51 I just saw y'all were there last night. There are gay bars on 4th, but they're like club vibes. RAIN & Oil Can's are two. Highland sucks. Those bars are slightly more male centric, but lesbians go too.
3926 2018-06-07 15:59:51 Higher gas prices are actually a good thing for our economy.  Barrels need to sell for $80 and then our own oil exploration can really flourish.
3927 2018-06-07 15:59:48 Lawd don’t let me get on this oil n see his long neck ass this weekend

3931 2018-06-07 15:59:27 my summer ‘18 aesthetic is keeping a jar of peanut butter and lavender essential oil at my office cubicle at all times
3932 2018-06-07 15:59:19 He owns:
Oil stocks, gas stocks, electricity stocks.
Forget him money is more important than you.
3933 2018-06-07 15:59:12 Like with your tax returns, where is the proof? The price of electricity is based on price of oil which is going up, there is a natural lag in the supply and demand equation. Price at pump going up, utilities will follow. And cost of solar is now 2x under your watch....
3934 2018-06-07 15:58:49 yes it was. Influencing marketing is scam snake oil sales people. All these influences and affiliates need to get real jobs
3935 2018-06-07 15:58:24 BC is one of the few coasts in the world that has not suffered a catastrophic oil spill. 
I worked on loading tankers. I was the one who give the order to shut loading.
It will happen Shipping this crap will be the end of the BC coast .

3937 2018-06-07 15:58:21 Made my choice no Audi for me I saw a tweet a few weeks back a guy was complaining about his brand new Q7 over hearing and something about oil consumption so I guess Audi has lost my trust just like Samsung

3940 2018-06-07 15:57:51 Tbvh it's just funny how some "Christians" are okay with stories in the bible but if it happens in this time and age, it's not okay??????
1.Elijah & The Widow's jar of oil
2.Jacob's wrestle with God
It's important you read your bibles BY YOURSELF and for yourself.
3941 2018-06-07 15:57:49 When working hard knows no hours... Burning late night oil!
3942 2018-06-07 15:57:37 My hand and head are almost healed of over 10 years of weeping sores all over them, the GPs kept prescribing stuff that didn't work but a herbalist told me a combination of stress, diet and chemicals were causing it. Wholefood, soap nuts, almond oil and watercolour painting help

3944 2018-06-07 15:57:36 Is there a "drizzle of olive oil" on that first pic?
3945 2018-06-07 15:57:31 That’s rich coming from a party that practice politics of revenge who denied oil royalty and no allocation at all to opposition MPs..

3949 2018-06-07 15:56:37 Yes true....my freinds grandfather makes a Ayurvedic oil which is growing hair for baldys... Ayurveda has cure for everything
3950 2018-06-07 15:56:26 Making eggs n oil just splashed on my chest im upset 
3951 2018-06-07 15:56:25 How about this, I don't even really know what truffle oil is and I don't want to know. 3 things go on fries. Salt, ketchup or vinegar, on very rare occasions.
3952 2018-06-07 15:56:20 Please stop using palm oil in your products. It leads to deforestation and kills wildlife. I don’t want to have to stop buying Nutella but will if it’s not changed.
3953 2018-06-07 15:56:19 And oil
3954 2018-06-07 15:56:13 Got to do everything we can for BIG OIL
3955 2018-06-07 15:56:12 Olive oil is very healthy for your skin plus it's super slippery, probably wouldn't even hurt at the slightest
3956 2018-06-07 15:56:07 ポピパ0章、終了......
3957 2018-06-07 15:56:06 Go back further...many years of US propping up dictators for oil.
3958 2018-06-07 15:56:03 Adorable bullshit. Record is clear on NRA active opposition to smart guns...all the way to orchestrating veto of NJ smart gun law repeal. 

If @NRA really was about gun safety, they would be leading the charge. 

Every gun incident impacts ~10 voters, tipping point is here.
3959 2018-06-07 15:56:00 it needs a bit of agrax earthshade or nuln oil, naturally :P

No but really, that looks great. Bit of battle damage perhaps
3960 2018-06-07 15:55:54 Mining, drilling for oil & gas, depleting ground water in large scale etc loosens soil & creates cave in of earth below. Add heating up of the earth, greenhouse gases. Either these makes molten lava to escape thru these faults or makes the plates move faster than they should.
3961 2018-06-07 15:55:53 This should be an oil painting
3962 2018-06-07 15:55:49 I don’t know, Maryam was super happy last two weeks, announcing to bulldoze anyone coming her way. Wasn’t worried about her at all. Did the same couple of months ago. 

But if there is genuinely a new development in London today than courts should allow for few days.
3963 2018-06-07 15:55:49 Academic s fearful of attacking the Israeli narrative are little more than snake oil salesman and women.

3969 2018-06-07 15:55:17 Oil Industry CEO's gathered with Dick Cheney a few days after Bush Jr. became President. They wrote the laws, etc. regulating oil. Don't forget  Cheney was the  real President (in the shadows).
3970 2018-06-07 15:55:15 NAH WAS TOO OIL
3971 2018-06-07 15:55:07 Propaganda against venezuela that has a lot of oil for the US corporations to steal ...I hope your whole life is a misery like the one your bosses  imposed on Venezuelan people who still proudly resist the USA imperialism.
 F yr "democracy" ,leave venezuela to its people.
3972 2018-06-07 15:55:02 His statements on economics are a little off-kilter but, frankly, not outside the realm of current discussion on the subject due to frustrations over global economic situations. His stance on the oil sands is what sets people off, rightly or wrongly, and irrationality escalates.
3973 2018-06-07 15:55:00 Currently changing my oil this is going to take forever
3974 2018-06-07 15:54:53 No .as you know our goverment has made an industry out of war.....I bet if the war mongers children had to partake they wouldnt be so quick to send our 18 to 25 year olds to foreign soil in the name of opium and oil
3975 2018-06-07 15:54:51 I watched the last one you posted about oil and the 1st 10 or 15 minutes were irritating. People virtue signaling with someone else's money.

3991 2018-06-07 15:52:41 Israeli criminals use exploding bullets to cripple Palestinians. If these are not war crimes, then what is? And the Americans support them? Dick Cheney, Rupert Murdoch and former CIA boss James Woolsey among unholy cabal who are sponsoring oil drilling in occupied Golan heights.
3992 2018-06-07 15:52:40 Exactly, because higher oil prices benefit Koch owned oil assets, and Putin

4000 2018-06-07 15:51:43 3rd falsehood today --Trump said that America is exporting energy for the first time in its history. We have exported coal, gas & oil for decades. High schoolers know this.

4004 2018-06-07 15:51:34 Them: Recent studies show eating one pizza is like having two spoons of warm oil!

4010 2018-06-07 15:50:10 Jeneroux: Kinder Morgan said its pipeline was worth $2.5 billion. Why did we pay $4.5 billion for it?

Trudeau: It's a real shame to see you call me out like that. Rich oil executives deserve money too.

4011 2018-06-07 15:50:00 Hi Monique, we use 100% sustainably produced palm oil in our products & will continue to do so. We’re taking further action, engaging suppliers to drive change on the ground as we believe it’s critical that there’s sound palm oil sourcing practices across the board in order..1/2

4013 2018-06-07 15:49:52 What if Cronyn gets CANCER from contamination of the air, water or earth around him? What if poor people who live near chemical plants or oil drilling get CANCER? Which is tragic and which is just, oh well?

4017 2018-06-07 15:49:21 Or when you go in for oil change and told you need new brakes and 4 new tires 
4018 2018-06-07 15:49:16 @carolejames Hi Do not know who to talk to on this but it is about how patients who use medical clinics are not having their oil & tire pressure checked 
Doctors are not checking the basic of heart & blood pressure at these clinics This small preventive action could save millions

4025 2018-06-07 15:48:46 Great and congrats. But can you look into gas prices. Why are they going up, makes no sense. We are the biggest producers of energy and yet gas prices continue to rise.  Energy companies are exporting their oil production to the world and stiffing us with high gas prices. MAGA.
4026 2018-06-07 15:48:37 Bishop Nicholas: Sorry @JeffDSachs is leaving #GreenAttica for Rome today. Meeting at Vatican tomorrow with CEOs of oil companies. Eastern & Western Church looking intensively at sustainability. If we had a preview here then Jeffrey, like St Paul, has produced his best for Rome!
4027 2018-06-07 15:48:36 Maduro is having his people starve, he is no Chavez. Oil prices are down, so the economy is tanking and inflation is expected to go to 13000% this year - yet the directive is to print more money. His communist policies are failing his people. Venezuela is in crisis.
4028 2018-06-07 15:48:35 Boulerice: You adopted Harper's GHG targets. You bought a pipeline. You're not eliminating oil subsidies. Keep your promises!

Trudeau: Alexandre, I don't have to listen to you because my team won the election.

4037 2018-06-07 15:47:17 No, I think there is a hidden agenda working against states not wanting to go US or EUs way. When trying to understand why the answer seems to be in the Money. When it comes to Syria US wanted Assad to be replaced long before Trump. Oil and gas is what gives value to the dollar.
4038 2018-06-07 15:47:15 Countries that have moved to the euro for trading oil/gas don’t last long before an “event” - Libya, Iraq, Iran.

4040 2018-06-07 15:46:56 I shower/bathe daily, but I put my hair up in a bun so it doesn't get wet. At first, I couldn't wear my hair down on day #2 or #3, but I can now since my hair doesn't produce as much oil.

The success stories & studies of CBD usage are amazing. Someday CBD oil will be common, not controversial. #Natural #Alternative #Health
4046 2018-06-07 15:46:37 No, the rethug lies about wmd and fake war for oil in Iraq  fed the spread of jihadists and killed thousands. Of course, let's not forget US support for the Shah of Iran, and the Saudies who figured largely in 9/11.

4061 2018-06-07 15:45:37 Iran was a democracy for a while, then they voted to no longer be exploited by western oil companies so we installed a brutal dictator to keep those profits flowing. 

We don’t want freedom, we want money.

4075 2018-06-07 15:45:00 I’m so awkward. I’m getting my oil changed and they asked if I wanted my tires rotated and I didn’t but I didn’t want to say no so guess who is also getting her tires rotated. :-)

4092 2018-06-07 15:43:31 Americans already had prescriptions for it until the '30s. Doctors knew it helped certain things. The DuPonts started making plastics from petrolium and didn't want hemp oil to compete, which would have been healthier. All of a sudden it was evil? B.S. Make it federally legal.

4095 2018-06-07 15:43:22 Well in the article i posted, sabi dun train contributed only 0.6% of the inflation... and as i said, pamasahe is still 8php since last year... yung petrol increase nga kasi is due to the strategy ng middle east to kill shale oil... nag overproduce sila 3 yrs ago
4096 2018-06-07 15:43:17 I thought it was in honour of those still shilling for oil.
4097 2018-06-07 15:43:14 Nope, Canada cutting off our electricity and oil exports to the USA, that would be a joke.
4098 2018-06-07 15:43:10 How do I always forget about the CBD oil?? 
4099 2018-06-07 15:43:08 My oil changes are free  thanks tho
4100 2018-06-07 15:43:04 Heating the oil can cause losses and not all oil is absorbed into food. It can be done but for precision dosing I recommend against this typically.

4106 2018-06-07 15:42:31 That's not a palm tree, and palm oil comes from the fruit of the tree not the tree itself so felling the tree is counter productive to the supply of palm oil.

4113 2018-06-07 15:41:50 Alberta still needs to get its oil to market.  And that takes more capacity. Build the pipeline!

4116 2018-06-07 15:41:39 Duh. Harm reduction != No harm. Its just the tiny possibility of a fraction of harm. I think you should look at the edible oil and sugarfree in your kitchen. You are already using harm reduction products in your daily life. Its odd that you dont know these. Its basic knowledge.
4117 2018-06-07 15:41:32 Is there anything about a private corporation you do not get. @SRPconnect also private, they are exempt vehicle tax Arizona by government but they have share holders same as oil companies 

Until they become non profit your Bill's go up and no share holders.

4121 2018-06-07 15:41:27 Yep, Oil lamp is the move today.
4122 2018-06-07 15:41:21 Every year, the amount of available crude oil reserves is revised UPWARD. Remember those morons in the 1970s talking about "PEAK OIL" ?  The fact is crude oil doesn't come from dead dinosaurs.  It's a naturally occurring substance (abiotic).
4123 2018-06-07 15:41:16 Oil change 
4124 2018-06-07 15:41:13 Don't worry, we people of borneo are generally well informed, aware and concerned. It's the corporates and corrupt government who makes it hard. We literally are oil palm forest now.

4141 2018-06-07 15:40:06 Your aim with this is not cleaner air but to hobble the natural gas & oil industry here in PA. It’s no secret you don’t like them. First you blame them for not paying their fair share, now it’s about clean air. Why don’t you say it, you want to be like Cuomo of NY by banning them
4142 2018-06-07 15:40:00 You misunderstand. A change to 2A is not required to make guns safer.

4146 2018-06-07 15:39:20 Sometimes chapstick doesn’t work for my lips. Here’s my moisturizing process

1.) apply coconut oil to hand

2.) makeout with hand

3.) tell Hand my hopes and fears 

3.) text hand less and less, stagnate and fade away
 
4.) Wipe away excess oil

I've never tried but comments I saw was that oil drops taste really bad and you have to keep it on your tongue for a minute. What's it like?

4259 2018-06-07 15:29:05 There are also two kinds of truffle oils. One is infused with what they call "truffle essence". It's basically artificial. Then you have truffle oil which is 100% natural. You can smell the difference. Artificial is very pungent. But yes. Idiots put it on anything.

4261 2018-06-07 15:29:04 Fuel prices are another example .In 2012 the BJP declared “bharat bandh” protests as the fuel price was around 80rs/litre. But the cost of crude oil was $109 per barrel (159 litres).Now it’s 80rs/litre again but crude oil has dropped massively to $60 per barrel.Ab protest karo?

4347 2018-06-07 15:20:28 The problem with this world is that they ignore the problem and fight over insignificant things. The world is facing global warming but people keep fighting over oil and economics.

4371 2018-06-07 15:18:14 For sure, I hope GM is very successful.  I think you are right, lithium will overtake oil in importance and perhaps value over the next 15-20 years.  We are hardly even started right now.

4427 2018-06-07 15:13:38 Deforestation is NOT inevitable. You CAN do something about it. Educate yourself and others. Don't buy Palm oil foods, which is what they plant in Indonesia once they clear the land of trees for logging (illegally in this case). Don't be passive!
4428 2018-06-07 15:13:19 I went for a 2 mile walk.. go to get my oil change and they offered me a fresh baked cookie like ugh COME ON people

4432 2018-06-07 15:13:07 QUIT USING PRODUCTS WITH PALM OIL IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO DESTROY THE HOUSES OF INNOCENT ORANGUTAN.
4433 2018-06-07 15:12:52 Watched a video of an orangutan protecting its home from illegal logging for palm oil plantations, despite the Indonesian government protecting the area. The actions still continue. This is both upsets me and really grinds my gears.

4438 2018-06-07 15:12:38 there's no bailout math can compete with  the natural gas brought online with the higher oil prices after the Iran deal debacle.  $80 oil ends coal. Gas spins up an electrical power turbine under 10 minutes, coal takes over an hour. bailout is another bad joke
4439 2018-06-07 15:12:33 Based on record production rates & fact that we export a lot of it, if we produced up to those record highs & kept it in Canada, we have over 200yrs of proven oil reserves & around 2 THOUSAND years of estimated reserves...& LOTS & LOTS of time to transition from oil to new tech.

4442 2018-06-07 15:11:48 Oil has dropped more than 10 points recently.  Why has gas prices stalled out at the highs?
4443 2018-06-07 15:11:38 CBD oil does not have THC in it. Plus just using a topical cream will not register a positive. Just like if you put rubbing alcohol on yourself, it would not give you a BAC

4445 2018-06-07 15:11:32 They’ve literally created a trillion dollar industry over a false theory. Oil companies have benefited by raising their prices massively whilst investing in “green” energies

4448 2018-06-07 15:11:08 Being an automaker is hard. That's why they all trade at cheap PE ratio; except for Tesla. Personally, I just want to see EVs be successful for all automakers. My main investment thesis will be lithium, the next big oil?

4450 2018-06-07 15:11:04 I don't agree with this. Oil price over 80 $ will stimulate  electric vehicles sales which will cause lower demans for oil.  Musk will be happy with higher oil price.
4451 2018-06-07 15:11:03 Between this logging and the Palm Oil industry we are on our way to losing another species to greed! Please, we cannot let this happen, we have got to respect and protect the creatures of this world.Our survival depends on it as well.

4465 2018-06-07 15:09:57 It's just that routine care is better paid for out of pocket. Just like how we pay for oil changes and gas fillups out of pocket for our car. 
Using insurance to pay for it means you pay $130 (or more?) for what should be a $90 visit.
You just don't realize it cuz monthly payment

4472 2018-06-07 15:09:20 I believe it is much more nuanced than that... So no I wouldn't say they don't care much about human rights violations. In my experience, the country is doing a lot to actually appease the global market and it's not just about oil.
4473 2018-06-07 15:09:12 Good direct deposit this morning, found my debit card, got my oil changed, and my friends are gunna visit me today man what a wonderful Thursday

4500 2018-06-07 15:06:49 2/4 The oil industry is the main source of the country's income at about 90% of it coming from state-owned PDVSA and affiliates. Therefore, the "government" or actually the ruling party have had complete control over the national income for ALMOST  20 YEARS.

4517 2018-06-07 15:05:15 I'm glad you're doing something but from what I've read they don't care much about human rights violations since no one will punish them since they want that oil. Right?

4544 2018-06-07 15:03:22 Yes absolutely, but there's a chicken/egg issue. Under simple average 100% tariff on pink shoelaces and 0% tariff on oil and gas exports = 50% average tariffs. Would this scenario represent the state of trade?

4550 2018-06-07 15:02:35 Which is my original point: "even if it is more expensive, we still need to do it" .

And, mathematically, it will always be more expensive. Oil is just the same sunlight. Except we need not spend any effort collecting it.

Let's just accept it and move onward.

4567 2018-06-07 15:00:33 I am fairly paranoid about snake oil salesmen-I have a ton of mysterious illnesses and am firmly upper middle class so I know people will try to sell me a lot of stuff of dubious healing properties. 

But every supplement my new doc recommends has been super effective.

4631 2018-06-07 14:54:40 so if there's no money to be made in nuclear, if it's pretty much uninsurable, & it creates dangerous waste that never goes away, then why shouldn't oil & gas be more profitable? *scratches head & walks away puzzled*

4634 2018-06-07 14:54:22 Crude oil prices have been volatile recently & this imparts considerable uncertainty to the inflation outlook, both on the upside and the downside. Will the interest rate hike within next 6 months lead to a disruption in Sri Lanka's growth recovery ?

4660 2018-06-07 14:51:29 No - I'm saying that if the EU's strategic position was as weak as I hear on heavy repeat on mainstream US media, the US would not be engaged in all-out economic warfare against Nord Stream 2, Russia, Germany, DB, Iran (trying to sell oil in EUR), etc.
4661 2018-06-07 14:51:20 The oil and gas industry knows global warming is happening and have to actively plan projects, to avoid the effects of global warming.

4707 2018-06-07 14:47:31 So my friend tells me that the girl who spat on me is doing oil paints for her art prac. We looked at eachother and asked "Does this hoe even know how to use oil paints? She couldn't even prime her canvas the last time"

4735 2018-06-07 14:44:17 Not especially, but the alternative turned out to be a Moroccan tapas place with his parents and their friends. I’d never been anywhere without a table cloth before. Now there were people breaking bits of bread off a loaf, with their hands, and dunking it in olive oil
4736 2018-06-07 14:44:06 When i wasnt sick it worked like a charm. My system is so wonky now. Like cbd oil worked once. Next day, it didn't. Same with edible. Up the dosage and i get sick

4746 2018-06-07 14:42:26 Are you naive enough not to see how much government has subsidized oil & gas industries through the decades?  Not to mention energy independence, saving the environment, all national security issues.

4759 2018-06-07 14:41:08 It is in my case. It broke me out so bad but I love using cleansing oil! So, is using micellar water is as good as using cleansing oil?
4760 2018-06-07 14:41:00 So that field is now 70% foreign owned. I wonder if people will complain? If they do, remind that that PBR owns 100% at least one oil and gas well in the Gulf of Mexico.
4761 2018-06-07 14:40:54 eat oxygen and drink helium sis. and wink your eyes, they got oil too, you gotta burn em up
4762 2018-06-07 14:40:49 And think about this:  if Putin wanted Trump to win so badly, what did he get for his efforts?
The US is economically much stronger, militarily building up, securing its borders, reworking trade agreements for more favorable US terms, and we're now a net exporter of oil.
4763 2018-06-07 14:40:36 These are the ones I purchased from HagRoot's 100+ scents, I don't make these. They have coconut oil in the cologne/perfume & shea butter in the deodorant.

4808 2018-06-07 14:35:16 They could, and very painfully for Canada; less so for the USA. 
But not inconsequentially: the US economy does thrive on Canadian oil, natural gas, potash, minerals, wood, hydro - and on our customers for their cars, machinery, plastics, technology, food, services.

4846 2018-06-07 14:30:35 @MBForex Dear Mr. Boutros. At the start of the week you made an analysis of oil. There was a chart when you compared the price action of 2009 growth to that of this years. Could you please tell me how you compared the same graph but overlapped in with different time scale onTview

4867 2018-06-07 14:28:20 Why is that when you look at a democratic politician it just makes you think of a weak, snively, and shady snake oil salesman. Who in their right mind allows themselves to be led by these kind of people. Grow up and educate yourself.
4868 2018-06-07 14:28:12 Not a question of "best" or "worst."  Question of trade balances.  Think of it this way, if oil is priced in both CNY & USD, & China wants cheap oil in CNY while US needs relatively expensive USD oil to make shale work, CNY/USD should rise over time thru oil link, no?  Same thing
4869 2018-06-07 14:28:11 What reality, pre or post 1/20/17? Today's reality says for every 2.9% increase in your wages, the Oil Companies that just got a $2.5 Trillion Tax Cut will charge you 33% more for Gas, which costs you more than what you gained! It's called dollar devaluation. Good luck.

4978 2018-06-07 14:15:59 what kinda oil? name brand or bulk? (10W50) or (5W20) do you change filter every time? Just wondering...
4979 2018-06-07 14:15:55 That' in the 70s and 80's coming from a low base oil boom. Which resource we have that is highly sort and will always have such consistent demand?
4980 2018-06-07 14:15:53 I could care-less about my final tomorrow just to tally and do the best for our final project report. I understand my groupmates must have working hard too.

5005 2018-06-07 14:13:17 @anandmahindra Mr.Anand, why are electric and alternate fuels still not being encouraged in a big way here, whereas other countries are progressing rapidly. Is it something to do with oil revenue that we generate. Appreciate your opinion on this. Thanks.
5006 2018-06-07 14:13:13 Auto manufacturers are being forced kicking to evolve to EV technology, EV vehicles are 75% less maintenance compared to a gas vehicle , no incentive to push them . GOV , Big OIL and Ethanol all against , You get 150 miles + per charger for 3 bucks ... Thats a deal .
5007 2018-06-07 14:13:12 For India, but there is no way the country and its foreign policy establishment will take kindly on another country asking it to follow unilateral rules. Non-alignment as a phrase may be dead but its spirit goes on. You can’t tell India not to buy weapons or oil from someone.
5008 2018-06-07 14:13:11 Oh my god this oil change is taking forever
5009 2018-06-07 14:13:06 Why does everyone keep trying to treat the symptoms instead of the problem.  You don't fix a car leaking oil by placing oil dry on the oil puddle, you fix the leak.

Den. McCain,
I have written you before...you can help yourself tremendously if you were to start some high CBD low THC cannabis oil for your glio...check out Dr. Jeffrey Hergenrather’s website,he’s available for consultation...just trying to help! 
5011 2018-06-07 14:12:49 What are they clearing them for. Palm oil?
5012 2018-06-07 14:12:45 Most people lose weight because they were overeating before. Make sure you eat enough high density fats and add olive oil to many things and you should be ok.

5021 2018-06-07 14:11:21 I think that the two recent issues that have irked India are both sanctions related: (I) arms purchases from Russia, especially the S400 and (II) unilateral US withdrawal from JCPOA which can see sanctions on Iranian oil. Trade disputes and Trump’s rhetoric is bearable for ..
5022 2018-06-07 14:11:19 Nah, it depends. I would not say that about someone shorting oil companies or sth like that.

5024 2018-06-07 14:11:07 This is also what drives me crazy... Solar has now hit an all time low in terms of price. Why are we buying Kinder Morgan's stupid pipe, when we could Have a massive solar farm for that same price... We could sell electricity instead of oil.
5025 2018-06-07 14:11:03 Sorry you think you are arguing with me.  You are arguing with facts, which have nothing to do with my “page”.  

Offshore permits are not correlated to either the production OR price of oil.  Can’t pin current gas prices on Obama.

5032 2018-06-07 14:10:15 I’ve just read that you can use coconut oil as l*be. 

You can use it as a face+body moisturiser, as a hair treatment, to cook with AND as l*be? 

Coconut oil needs an OSCAR, that multi talented bitch.

5036 2018-06-07 14:10:04  it could be anything. Normally something minor like losing the oil cap, or not being able to get the drain plug off.
5037 2018-06-07 14:09:46 Weasel words from an over-ripe politician. It is way past time to change the oil in this rusted out heap.
5038 2018-06-07 14:09:40 Electric cars are simple technology, just going to take a few years for people to catch up , it does not help car manufacture do not pust EV cars they will be losing , EV are 75% less maintenance and get 150 miles + per charge . GOV , Big Oil and Ethanol are also against EV

5051 2018-06-07 14:08:24 In fact, the U.S. has been a net exporter of oil for a decade.  We process crude more efficiently and in higher volume than anyone. So, we import crude and then export finished products (gas, kerosene, etc.) Trump just lies to pander to the unthinking in his crowd of supporters.

5060 2018-06-07 14:07:55 Costa Rica uses hydro which is well known. Without hydro electricity not viable. China and India leading the world in building coal plants and pollution as well which you failed to mention. Norway is expanding oil exports to meet global demand which you also failed to mention

5062 2018-06-07 14:07:51 No, that wealth was almost entirely destroyed in the Civil War, and the Republican led anti-slavery North was far far richer than the Democratic pro-slavery South. Also, the middle East has huge oil reserves and still practices slavery, yet they are still poor.
5063 2018-06-07 14:07:47 oa yung presyo mas mahal pa sa banana cue e may sugar at cooking oil nga yun!
5064 2018-06-07 14:07:45 I don't disagree with that. I find that PCs and Liberals prop up a dying industry like oil with subsidies for short term profits. If that same money was aimed toward the green sector in order to lower consumer costs we'd see change quicker. Cap and trade is a bandaid at best.
5065 2018-06-07 14:07:42 "this math about oil sands is wrong, by an order of magnitude."

"but oil sands are bad."

5102 2018-06-07 14:03:10 Palm oil is a very big focus for us right now, and I can confirm that we only use RSPO certified sustainable oil in our snacks. Please rest assured that our kitchen team is on the lookout for alternatives.

5125 2018-06-07 14:01:30 @kubus_gt  with all of my oil changes, I spend so much time there!  
5126 2018-06-07 14:01:12 Cool. We might need to add more days to our own calendar cos 365 days won't suffice for each June 12 heroes and heroines to have their own individual holiday. Aren't we glamorously lazy, after all we are oil producing, everyday can be holiday.

5130 2018-06-07 14:00:41 Get a bag of cheap lemons/limes/oranges, cut them up, squeeze the around garden/lawn edges, then leave chunks dotted around. They HATE citrus. Olbas oil also works but this is cheaper!

5137 2018-06-07 13:59:59 Frozen oil and Chosen vessel. 
5138 2018-06-07 13:59:48 Different industry and different product. How long can a company hold on to oil when prices are bad? How long do they have to keep paying all their expenses when prices are bad? I have to dump my product in 2 days and have to feed cows every day regardless of markets.
5139 2018-06-07 13:59:48 The SB1gas tax went in effect over a year ago at a set amount and to be used to repair the public roads (which we badly need). Please stop the lies. Rising gas prices are across the country because of federal policies & greedy oil companies.
5140 2018-06-07 13:59:38 True. Lots of folks in oil and gas remain EV "skeptics." As EV product offerings and sales skyrocket, that skepticism remains often intact.
5141 2018-06-07 13:59:38 Its new technology to most , I think auto manufactures are to blame , They rather push gas power over a EV , more than 75% less maintenance there losing , EV don't break down much .
Then you have DC Swamp with big oil and Ethanol scumbags all pushing there outdated fuels

5151 2018-06-07 13:57:58 @JustinTrudeau Trump confirms he will not abide by WTO rulings.  Why is Canada playing by the rules when the other party does not?  We should renegotiate our oil, electricity, water supply and other deals with the USA.
5152 2018-06-07 13:57:54 I work in the oil and gas industry. Price volatility is part of every time life (as is its impact on our industry and my income and employment). Yet somehow we make do without government protectionism, quotas and price controls.

5163 2018-06-07 13:56:46 No, I work in oil and gas so don’t lecture me. You don’t know what my attitude is. Rationality is not capitulating with the likes of Trump or guys like you.
5164 2018-06-07 13:56:41 Bonjour Matthew, I am in Quebec, promoting to my friends, the ecomonic value of sustainable Oil and Gas development while providing quality stewardship of the environment. Economic development and responsible stewardship of the environment are both crirical.

5188 2018-06-07 13:53:57 Cannabis oil injected directly into the cancerous region should kill it, as well as b17 it think. It comes from a tree that is indigenous to japan,  and is illegal here because of the fact that it cures cancer.

5198 2018-06-07 13:52:18 remaining sticker residue. 5. Ask your local hardware store to recommend a commercial adhesive-removing product that is non-toxic. Orange oil, for example, is very effective at removing the gummy residue from stickers. We hope that you will find these suggestions helpful.

After a few moments, wipe away the oil using a clean cloth. If the sticker residue is still present, use a pencil eraser to rub off

5206 2018-06-07 13:51:50 Hydrophobic does not mean solely an irrational fear of water.

Oleophobic does not mean to have an irrational fear of oil - it means repellant of oil or lacking an affinity for oil.

Your refusal to acknowledge the full definition of a word does not make me incompetent.

5253 2018-06-07 13:46:17 In the third falsehood today, Trump said that America is exporting energy for the first time in its history. We have exported coal, gas and oil for decades. High schoolers know this.

So, Trumpers: Your God-King is either a liar or an idiot. Why doesnt that matter to you?
5254 2018-06-07 13:46:17 I agree with what you're saying.  Energy efficiency is the foundation of mechanical engineering.  To bad you didn't install heat recovery in once-through boilers in the oil sands.

5406 2018-06-07 13:32:00 Keeping the price of oil / gas low hurts Putin.

That's our biggest weapon...and why Trump is pushing to increase US production imo.

And yep asking NATO countries to spend on defense isn't pro-russia.

5409 2018-06-07 13:31:49 Yes. Earnings are strong. Employment is strong. Demand is strong. Spending is rising. Lots of new oil revenue and Repatriation. Good R&D and tech funding. Lots of corporate investment and reinvestments. Slightly larger paychecks.

Less than 1/4 of the non-taxed money these companies funnel into overseas bank-accounts could cover the "carbon tax" and then some.

5431 2018-06-07 13:29:07 before you can get a drop of oil from an olive, it has to be shaken, beaten, and pressed. but once you get past the labor, you’ll have an abundance of flowing oil. 

y’all not ready for this word this morning..

5436 2018-06-07 13:27:59 How about we stop drilling so we save our precious planet that was loaned to us and start using solar power. Will create more jobs and save environment. I think the oil companies have proven that drilling is not safe. Save our planet. Save mankind. Just saying.

5471 2018-06-07 13:24:22 I've heard of using oil as a heat conductor to dump the heat that the PC generates, but wouldn't it cause the temperature in the aquarium portion of it to rise too high to properly support the fish and plant life?

5473 2018-06-07 13:24:15 2/2 The gap is explained as follows:  Men tend to work longer hours than women/  Men do high paying jobs that women don't do (oil rig worker, etc). Women slow down to have babies whereas men work even harder during those years.  2/3
5474 2018-06-07 13:24:07 Same difference. Buy the 160 and the 150mm air spring. It’s a 20 minute job and I already have all the tools and oil.
5475 2018-06-07 13:24:04 Why only American diplomats are susceptible to sound sickness coincident with Trump's elections; likely driving some foreign policy agenda with the help of gas/oil industry which developed Sonic drilling tools
5476 2018-06-07 13:23:56 How petrol price rises? It depends upon crude oil rate . Its not ki 10 saal me itna aur modi k 4 saal me itna.

5481 2018-06-07 13:23:30 Expensive to drill holes that deep. Normal oil rigs not big enough. Much risk with any faults etc if geology not super stable.
Solar got much cheaper, and is so easy.
Oh, and a $billion for power line from Coopers Basin.

Maybe, maybe not but even if it stays at current levels due to increased supply side risks (Venezuela, Iran and now issues around Cibuti), it might induce crisis on some energy dependent economies (with current account problems).

5628 2018-06-07 13:10:07 I haven't checked lately, but some ethanol plants have used coal or gas for heat in the production process, a big hit to both EROEI (energy return on energy invested) as well as CO2 balance. Since oil & gas often come from the same well, fossil interests still very involved.

5649 2018-06-07 13:07:36 Its quite simple TS!   Blocking use of oil by stoping a pipeline will not stop our use of oil.  We need to change habits of the end users.... Ie Industry, Transport, Plastics, etc.  Blocking the pipeline just means more foreign oil comes up the St Lawrence to meet real demand.

5652 2018-06-07 13:06:51 THERE IS. PLENTY. Are you trying to deny that the couple dozen beheaded are year are in anyway equivalent to the THOUSANDS slaughtered in Syria?  AND AGAIN OIL BOATS EXIST. Europe is getting away from oil, the us makes most of it's own, we have little stake in this.
5653 2018-06-07 13:06:50 Oh yeah, I've heard about double cleansing! I only use water based or foam cleansing tho. I haven't tried oil yet

5708 2018-06-07 12:59:59 I expect oil to fall to $10 in the next year so China will be a beneficiary. Oil will rally to $300+ in next cycle so China will face some headwinds out several years. Ultimately I don't see it being a huge factor. A big rise in oil prices will boost their alternatives business.

5753 2018-06-07 12:55:12 Oil? I've just filled it with fuel, it can bugger off if it thinks it's getting anything else from me. 
5754 2018-06-07 12:55:02 No. Oil prices increased solely because OPEC wanted to  increase their bottom line. Money drives OPEC. Besides oil is still way below inflation.  Gas should be at $4 a gallon.  In Michigan it's around $2.30. Of course depending on where one lives.
5755 2018-06-07 12:54:55 Absolutely

5772 2018-06-07 12:53:07 The oil is one thing and I agree the royalty which was promised should be given to sarawak. But the main reason Sarawak is “poor” is due to PBB and Taib. You guys should know that.
5773 2018-06-07 12:53:01 lol, dude oil corps duped you with C level propaganda. Russia's A level propaganda probably have u believing Trump is innocent and Comey is the bad guy..Lmfao dummy
5774 2018-06-07 12:52:59 Should have went to Scotland’s Presbyterian church if he wanted to use his oil business skills....even then I don’t think ‘business sense’ is really a great asset for the church.
5775 2018-06-07 12:52:39 Ms. Wynne like Ms. Notley very strategic folks and very intelligent. What they can't seem to realize is that emotional aspects of their jobs are important. Fiscal prudence also important. Also logic. Can't tell us there is no money when spending like mad for the oil industry.

5787 2018-06-07 12:51:32 Your welcome
5788 2018-06-07 12:51:24 ah yes, they totally want access to the drying up oil fields when they're already all going green and have plenty of ways to move oil OTHER THAN PIPES.  You keep living in your bubble where every problem is caused by the US and they never do ANYTHING for the right reason.
5789 2018-06-07 12:51:23 Corbyn praised a Venezuela that is in one of the continents with lowest living conditions for having high standards of living.

5881 2018-06-07 12:40:05 My little trick to clear oil from driveway concrete is use non clumping kitty litter and pout a layer on top of the oil and grind it into the stain with your foot until only powder is left. Also get the iced coffee for Lynette when you order her the Jack. Across from Arclight.

5885 2018-06-07 12:39:44 Article very hollow and lacks facts. It does not talk about subsidies. When the oil price was $140 during Congress subsidies to extent of 4.5 lakh crores were given over 5 years. BJP has invested 30-40k crores in subsidies and used the balance to reduce the current a/c deficit.

5927 2018-06-07 12:34:16 Do you think a 5% production tax rate is too much for any industry? Or is it just that Oklahoma hasn’t diversified enough? 5% matches all the other oil producing states in the US. They’ll stop drilling everywhere if they stop in OK.

5941 2018-06-07 12:32:23 Tis arright. Pretty close to vegetable oil in taste.
5942 2018-06-07 12:32:19 Then black markets emerge and is the chunks of the economy fall outside of regime control and repression needs to be stepped up. Venezuela is a fantastic example. And they had oil money until the regime destroyed the infrastructure so they can't even leverage that.
5943 2018-06-07 12:32:15 The problem is that sometimes "running rings" works . Take Keynesian economics for example . It was the standard school of thought after WW2,but the oil shock of the 1970s proved it doesn't always work. Then after the 07 financial crisis the Keynesian style helped boost growth .

5952 2018-06-07 12:31:22 Thank you for saying so, Jeff. This social media platform is greased in slick oil. It is so easy to slither on it like a snake. So easy to slide down and off the edge. I have all but despised several slanderers lately and I am not going to let this place do that to me.

5963 2018-06-07 12:29:50 There was a real good discussion with oil Polian on SiriusXM NFL on the fullback. They elected not to because the usage just simply didn’t warrant it enough. But if you had a dual role guy, then it would be more likely you could use a full back in an offense.
5964 2018-06-07 12:29:24 Unfortunately not enough people care - if they did this would stop instantly - just boycott any product containing palm oil - but our politicians prefer to sit back and blame governments of countries like Indonesia and our people are indifferent to the plight of the natural world

6197 2018-06-07 12:03:10 Sarawak is indeed rich with oil, assets and whatnot but state actually poor. For almost past 40 years, we enjoyed only 5% of our own oil royalty. Only after past few years the royalty increase by 20% bcs arwah Tok Nan strongly demanded for it from kerajaan persekutuan :')

6213 2018-06-07 12:00:57 If you are in the industry you should have a better answer for declining Oil production than stating a vague "intent". I'm not being personal, merely stating the facts. If the data troubles you, then perhaps you should admit that policy has erred somewhere.
6214 2018-06-07 12:00:46 Cleaning up the tar sands complex in Alberta has already been estimated to cost more than the total revenues generated by all the oil that will come out of the ground. Not sure if proper empirical evidence was taken into account before making this major decision...

6219 2018-06-07 11:59:44 And the Canadians are worried about Trade deals!  What is this going to do to West Virginia?  Canada needs to fix their TransCanada pipelines before they can make any trade deals!  Oil leaks cost the environment, the consumer, and much more.  US should charge Canada big $$!

6481 2018-06-07 11:19:23 I'm good at thinking through facts not just sprouting. Point is India will be dependent on Oil imports many decades into future. Government needs to bring in a strategy of importing smartly not push a fantasy argument that we'd be free of Crude imports in the future.

6488 2018-06-07 11:18:56 2php pa lang increase sa gas because of that january... so increase in may was because of market increase... you heard about the issue with opec prices lowering oil price last 2 yrs ago? Nasa balita naman yun, they also persuaded a year ago for russia to increase prices

6526 2018-06-07 11:13:11 These industries involve huge expenditures & without a lot of revenue coming from oil, some of these industries wouldn't have been established as the amount of revenue from other sources cannot be enough to meet the revenue demands of these industries... #thinkbluetidegroup.

6592 2018-06-07 10:58:25 Today my health horoscope told me that you're an ethically bankrupt charlatan who never thinks twice to sell snake oil using your previously respectable career as a thinly veiled con masked as credibility to gullible people looking for a quick fix.

6643 2018-06-07 10:47:29 But olive oil is still good for tomato sauces. It's not heated as much as to lose its properties.

6664 2018-06-07 10:43:56 Carbon tax would be more palatable if every cent collected had to go into carbon harm-reduction and alternative sources/research.  Building a pipeline to move the dirtiest, most expensive oil one can produce is counter-intuitive.

6732 2018-06-07 10:32:44 Maybe invest in 3m oil
6733 2018-06-07 10:32:43 Turns out putting oil in my hair didn't give it the "cool and totally not oily" effect I thought it would give.
6734 2018-06-07 10:32:29 Why no1 uses the argument that Corporate war machine that steals lesser countries resouces.   More money comes out of your taxes 4 Corperate hand outs. Than it will. cost 2 hve #Medicare4All.

Never any outrage 4wars that only help the central banks, weoponsCo. And Oil Industry
6735 2018-06-07 10:32:25 Well that's easy, no more payments for parliament services £billions
Scotland's exports, exported through Scottish ports, £billions, 
Then there's the bane of all oil and gas revenues, £billions. 
So I ask ,where's the deficit?  Only deficit there is is one caused by Westminster

6744 2018-06-07 10:31:07 This is exactly what trump is driving for. He wants to be fawned over, courted, begged - he wants all of us catering to his whims for justice, freedom, contracts, tariff exemptions, oil permits, & even for our jobs at private corporations.

Truly kingly behavior. And horrifying.
6745 2018-06-07 10:30:58 Lol everyone asking me for skin care routine, I don’t have one , I use normal  bathing soaps, (safeguard, dettol.. and the rest) , coconut oil sometimes, peace of mind too and no boyfriend to stress me 
6746 2018-06-07 10:30:56 u kno this oil will get sold to the u.s. then they will sell it back to us at a profit for them, u kno that right? maybe expand yr reading list.
6747 2018-06-07 10:30:56 Austria, Germans who lost their knack at conquering neighbors.                           Belarus, Russia with no oil.
Poland, Czech Republic trapped in an unlocked car.

6750 2018-06-07 10:30:07 Yes i know that and like i said they were more communist, and relied too heavily on oil which flopped for them. A better economic model couldve saved their programs by not making everything public. But privatizing things like disability or any of them is a huge mistake.

6759 2018-06-07 10:29:03 One of the worst?  What does that mean?  Worse than when they increased supply to lower Oil to $30/barrel in an effort to shut down the Fracking in the US.  All that did was teach US companies how to cut costs and become more efficient and introduce better tech into the oilfield.
6760 2018-06-07 10:28:44 For silky hair, mix 3 parts olive oil and 1 part honey. Put in microwave 30 sec. Apply to damp hair 20 mins with shower cap on. Rinse well!
6761 2018-06-07 10:28:40 No, no. All you do is roughly cut potatoes. Don't even need to peel them. Pre heat sunflower oil in the oven and throw in the potatoes with loads of seasoning. Douse with vinegar towards the end of cooking and dunk in your #SALADcream
6762 2018-06-07 10:28:35 Made it by HUMP day! Asian markets closed up, European markets re trading mixed, furtures & crude oil are up. Not bad! Enjoy Thursday!

6764 2018-06-07 10:27:51 I still maintain if you are not chopping oil money it's advisable to leave that city.  All the oil producing states are becoming so laid back.

6768 2018-06-07 10:26:45 Flip over to comparison. Cd you compare the components of the samosa of Mama Topi to the 27,000.Minus the flour, they dnt use similar oil,veggie spices&meats. Must be using some olive oil whereas the latter is using sm fortune butto that's been manipulated more than once

6771 2018-06-07 10:26:25 What do you mean by ‘more’? Volume or economic value? Anyway India’s dependence on crude oil should come down over the next few years

6775 2018-06-07 10:25:47 Cattle rearers should embrace ranching, acquire lands and build your facility, you people want to get every free of charge in this geographical space, we feed you with our oil yet you want us to leave our lands for you.. Nonsense

6784 2018-06-07 10:23:55 I guess it depends on the dealership. The particular oil change place I went to had a service fee for fluids and a flat fee for changing wipers. I know post auto parts stores will also do these for free as well.

6788 2018-06-07 10:23:19 Why TF do you think this deforestation is occurring? So they can use the land for oil palm cultivation!
6789 2018-06-07 10:23:16 With a probable extra -500 k from VZ (June), even a million bar. would not solve the equation... it's going to be a hot Summer for crude oil...
6790 2018-06-07 10:23:00 Is the high cost of petrol that the yoons are moaning about for that free car in any way related to the rising oil price?
6791 2018-06-07 10:22:42 Wait...avacado toast means...avacado slices on toast? I've been doing that for 20 years. I use olive oil and salt. What's the biggie here?
6792 2018-06-07 10:22:39 You can’t trust a snake that takes over the soul of an elephant. It’s easier to live beside the sane elephant. Speaking of oil and pipelines: it’s time Canada has its own pipeline to the world.
6793 2018-06-07 10:22:33 He ran a classic NY snake oil con on the rubes and they fell for it, hookline and sinker. They honestly believe that he gives a shit about em 
6794 2018-06-07 10:22:31 After careful consideration Mr. Professor statement. You will agree him. He said we created 10KMW electricity. Yes they created by loans & extra oil charges. Now their govt finished all is finished. He forget to mention about  creation strategy. For give him
6795 2018-06-07 10:22:28 You said same shit in 2014 they we found more fucking oil
6796 2018-06-07 10:22:09 Have you tried clove oil?
6797 2018-06-07 10:22:00 CBD oil is incredible. I use it for anxiety and it works wonders. I still take medication for anxiety (Sertraline) but CBD oil gives me the hope that I can someday soon not be reliable on medication and have a more natural way of helping.
6798 2018-06-07 10:21:56 And again a lot of their revenue came from state oil. I dont believe in the government controlling a company because thats communism. Taxes are already ridiculously low and the highest earners are not even paying them usually, those are taxes we arnt getting.
6799 2018-06-07 10:21:52 And to think that Equitorial Guinea is one of the richest (in comparison with her size) countries in the world in terms of oil resources. Who profits from them, of course, is a different story......

6832 2018-06-07 10:14:11 Sort of. But I take view that this is a transition & if all large companies followed BP lead in reducing operational emissions, demand for oil & gas falls quickly as result. Encouraging to hear one of ’s biggest companies saying to investors that decarbonising reduces OPEX too.

6840 2018-06-07 10:12:51 'They fear that the move presages a war with Iran that would destabilise the entire Middle East and lead to soaring oil prices and a further mass influx of refugees.'
6841 2018-06-07 10:12:45 Publicity stunt after publicity stunt after oil pipeline buy out/ sell out. Get real man. For real. For real. Tell the truth all the time. You can do it and it will earn our respect.
6842 2018-06-07 10:12:44 Suzukinis a national hero and we would do well to listen to his words on the Tar Sands. Since the entire model needs a minimum of $100/ barrel oil it will be years of losses most companies can’t handle before any hope of financial gain. Sick.

6846 2018-06-07 10:12:37 But I read somewhere that Petronas is seeking legally to get the complete authority over all oil rigs around Malaysia. Correct me if I’m wrong.

6887 2018-06-07 10:06:16 And it tasted good! Not firstly good, but it did it in a strange way, like tobacco or liquor. I don't understand you, boys. WHICH OLIVE OIL ARE YOU DRINKING?

6889 2018-06-07 10:04:53 Inflation is still on in the floor in Ireland (+0.4% in 12 months) - but a steep enough increase was seen in transport costs last month (+1.9%). Rising oil prices beginning to bite.
6890 2018-06-07 10:04:40 I suppose if they're throwing shade on things like quinoa and palm oil from deforested areas.

You don't have to feel guilty about eco destuction or ppl not able to afford their own cultural foods, otherwise nah.
6891 2018-06-07 10:04:20 I've been thinking that, if we ban #diesel, the electricity demand sharply increase. And, if we increase demand, we need to make sure that it's #sustainable (no Nuclear, no Oil, no Coal). This is probably too much but, we get to greatly reduce #pollution that way.
6892 2018-06-07 10:03:42 My skin once got irritated after I applied virgin coconut oil. Either my skin was that sensitive or the coconut oil was no longer a virgin.

6905 2018-06-07 10:01:38 @thismorning what about cbd oil for chronic pain
6906 2018-06-07 10:01:33 Or doesn't work...the oil majors wanted PSA contracts, and they didn't get them. So Shell and PetroVietnam pulled out, others made big losses, Iraq got vast oil revenues, Maliki blew it all. Looks like the contracts could get worse, if they ever get over this election crisis...
6907 2018-06-07 10:01:21 #ThisMorning I have had chronic pain for over 14 years now, I have exhausted the meds from the Doctor, the only thing I have found that helps is CBD Oil from @cbdbrothers. It's time that the UK changed it's stance on CBD oil for pain treatment.

6910 2018-06-07 10:00:39 However regression in 2020 seems to bee possible, but as cyclical caused by Sunspot cycle, economy highly unlikely

Much of this Sunspot cycle is alike with 1970's one, oil crises as political correlation

Crises yes, regression in cyclical rather in 2024, unless pass, like -13

6917 2018-06-07 09:59:54 Art, many thanks. It is easy to see what took place, it is dangerous to predict what will take place. What we need now is more heavy oil, EIA ONLY tells the inventory of light oil, so it is a pure guess work from here on, it is a $16m guess.
6918 2018-06-07 09:59:38 And had he managed them better and oil had sayed the same the country would not be bad off.  But soon oil revenues couldnt pay for all the social programs and the most recent president handled it so fucking poorly he devastated the country.

6939 2018-06-07 09:55:59 This sounds like more excuses.  Can you explain how your government can come up with 4 billion and pledge billions more to build a pipeline for tarsands oil in remote areas but pledges only 172.6 million over 3 years for first nations to have drinking water?

6944 2018-06-07 09:55:44 I used to take coconut oil daily for a decade and t actually caused some loose stools if I took a little too much of it. I also used it on my skin but turns out it was rather drying. Beef tallow works so much better
6945 2018-06-07 09:55:36 The same here, I read all the ingredients in everything and I stop buying them if contains palm oil. I'm sorry because I know so many ppl live by oil palm cultivation but it works like this: less consumer demand, less expansion of planting areas then more biodiversity protection.

7279 2018-06-07 08:51:23 Yet the economy is soaring, consumer confidence is high, illegal border crossings are down, US oil production is up, taxes have been cut, people are keeping more of the money they earn and getting bonuses. Unemployment is way down. Life is good. There will be no blue wave.
7280 2018-06-07 08:51:18 "There is an agreement betw the two oil ministries of the two countries #Sudan & #SouthSudan. They agreed to cooperate and resume oil production.

7286 2018-06-07 08:49:37 Hahaha, that's where the problem comes in. The oil can't do much without the moisture. You need to spray some water (boiled not tap water) then apply oil to seal in the moisture and at night use a satin scarf/bonnet to cover the hair. Ah we togeza?

7288 2018-06-07 08:49:10 Because US has now imposed more sanctions against Iran 

which is going to push the Iranian to confrontation with the West. This is what the US Warmongers always wanted. 

How else would the Corporate Elite get their hands on Iranian oil and gas without a Illegal war?

7290 2018-06-07 08:48:52 Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and the first thing that pops into my brain is palm oil, and my brain goes into overdrive thinking of all the potential interviewees I’ve yet to get responses from. It’s only been 4 days and this project has already consumed my life.
7291 2018-06-07 08:48:52 Congress had better educated ministers but Modi govt managed inflation better. May be they were lucky due to lower oil price.

7300 2018-06-07 08:47:46 Good to hear state-owned Oil Corp chief has resigned. Supplies Minister has said new chief will be chosen through free competition. Appointment of capable chief is not panacea for all the problems facing the firm. All corrupt senior officials must be removed too. Drain the swamp!
7301 2018-06-07 08:47:32 So will the 30% reduction in diesel car sales in the last year reduce palm oil use?
7302 2018-06-07 08:47:28 Data is new oil
7303 2018-06-07 08:47:12 Wow, I do admire you Femi. Your ability to construct irrelevant arguments and present them as somehow convincing is very good. You'd make a good snake oil salesman.

Meanwhile, we're Leaving the EU, because most people prefer to Leave the EU. People power.

7305 2018-06-07 08:46:50 Imagine the immense blessing of crude oil, fertile land & ores in Nigeria, yet over 150 million are poor from the 198 million in population (2018).
A chunk few enjoy more than 85% of the wealth of the nation, while tens of millions remain homeless, hungry etc. Its terribly sad .
7306 2018-06-07 08:46:39 If Lagos-Ibadan expressway could reach 80% completion rate & the new standard gauge rail-line 50% by the end of 2018, South West people would vote Buhari in 2019. Also he should ease import of rice, vegetable oil & fish for price to fall, citizen need to eat.
7307 2018-06-07 08:46:25 No I just apply the oil
7308 2018-06-07 08:46:09 Try castor oil, hair oil, and a terrorism crisis.
7309 2018-06-07 08:46:04 No they have not fixed it all they do is go slower ovee the pass over. The other issue with the wheels is they are supposed to use an oil or lubricant and they dont. cost cutting. @JacintaAllanMP @vline_ballarat
7310 2018-06-07 08:45:50 Petrol and diesel prices were cut by 9 paise and 8 paise respectively today. Petrol now costs Rs 85.45 in Mumbai and diesel costs Rs 73.17, according to the data available on Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.’s website.

7312 2018-06-07 08:45:37 Our public sector entities are mismanaged mainly due to political intervention.PSUs like BHEL, NLC, TNPL, our oil majors,space organisations etc., are successful may be because of less intervention from politicians.More the intervention more bureaucratic the management becomes.

7330 2018-06-07 08:42:13 @narendramodi It's is a humble request to put oil and petrol under a single umbrella of GST.  If you do so.. You will surely win elections in 2019. It is according to public opinion.

7332 2018-06-07 08:41:11 Don’t buy engine oil from Amazon, your local retailer will give you far better rates. Amazon’s commission and courier expenses due to the weight makes it impossible to get a good deal on engine oils.

Occasional slight dryness has been alleviated almost instantly with the application of a smear of coconut oil. I am convinced this is due to the change to a vegan diet.

Same thing happened in Guatemala with "banana"republic war before Libya and Iraq

7572 2018-06-07 07:48:53 I for one consider the globuli lobby unscrupulous snake oil sakesmen. Especially producers and pharmacists make a fortune by selling sugar and deceiving people. I think it's nothing less than a scandal.

7622 2018-06-07 07:36:34 The alternative is to tell them to go home because there’s nothing wrong with them. Many can’t accept that. They’ll probably end up with “alternative” medicine anyway. 

This approach makes them feel better, is safe, and they’re not ripped off by unscrupulous snake oil salesmen.
7623 2018-06-07 07:36:17 money dey sweet to chop but e no get oil.

7632 2018-06-07 07:34:28 I know Saudi well Bob. I would say their days are numbered as a regional power as there is a over supply of oil that is less and less in demand. 

Worse for them too is the fact large sections of their populace are unemployed & reply on a very generous welfare system.
7633 2018-06-07 07:34:27 Explanation by mumbling uncertain minister on fuel price make up is mind boggling.We purchase our oil through middle men We do not buy from nearest source Angola Why?We pay insurance on shipping Why the seller must pay We must pay on offloading  in SA and transport on SA only.

7642 2018-06-07 07:33:04 I Agee with sentiment. But remember that solar & coal are for electricity generation, oil is for transportation. The sooner we electrify the transportation sector the sooner we detach ourselves from the dirty oil Barron despots and regimes, the better for our economy and planet.

7656 2018-06-07 07:28:54 If Sasol is producing its petrol from coal and not oil, why is it always raising its prices when the price of oil goes up? The coal they are using is mined local and the petrol also produced locally.

7676 2018-06-07 07:24:47 3. We need the world to stop doing business with the fascist regime completely. We are fighting a very small religious minority. However, this vicious minority is well organized and extremely rich from oil money and the business deals with EU.

Raise prices of crude oil - make gasoline Prices go up in America

Canada is far and away the biggest purveyor of crude to its southern neighbor, hitting a record 2.2 million barrels a day last year

8120 2018-06-07 05:54:03 I think you are wrong.  Getting their oil on the world market was the strategy for a number of reasons.

8125 2018-06-07 05:52:51 They clearly said it's EARLY OIL PILOT SCHEME, it's for testing and not a lasting solution . Furthermore: Brent crude is going at $75 Today. 75×2000= $150K. Unless the government is paying the trucking company 15M per day, I strongly differ.

8128 2018-06-07 05:51:54 Increase in fuel price is attributed to many factors, many of which dont have to do with the Government. Factor like the power of the Dollar and International Oil Prices

8138 2018-06-07 05:50:20 Kalau pagi aku saranin gak usah pakai face oil. Takutnya malah berat banget karena di pagi kan harus pakai spf. Mending bikin simple aja fw>toner>day cream. Tapi day creamnya kudu yang ada spf yak. Minimal 30. Face oil pakai malamnya. Kalau aku sih routinenya gitu.

8144 2018-06-07 05:48:58 In spite of global crude oil  price being comparatively  low around 80 $ per barrel  but pricing of petrol and diesel are recorded very high.
8145 2018-06-07 05:48:58 But that means growth will not be indefinite as shale oil proponents believe. When I here US production growing by another 3-5mbpd, I just wonder where that’s will go if China does not buy it.
8146 2018-06-07 05:48:39 I think I remember you mentioning it! I use a moisturizer infused with it (and I believe my exfoliant has it too.) It works great on my cheeks, but for some reason my chin will not stop peeling.  I have some concentrated oil that I will definitely try though! Thanks! 
8147 2018-06-07 05:48:39 Smart maker friends

Question about vacuum pumps: 

I have a harbor freight vacuum pump. It spews oil like crazy out the exhaust vent (a fine mist of oil). I bought a few air/water seporators & that did not filter the oil out. 

Anyone have a good solution to containing the oil?
8148 2018-06-07 05:48:38 paling menyirap hari tu baru beli biore cleansing oil rm19 now kat guardian 14??!! wtf
8149 2018-06-07 05:48:33 When oil was as $100+ and Canada was selling a lot of it, the CAD was at 1.15. Now that oil at $65 and Canada is not selling a lot, the CAD is at 0.75. If oil is really only 10% of GDP, do you really think that would be the case? Most of the Canadian Economy is fake.

8159 2018-06-07 05:45:52 Let me balance u rite there,USA buys oil from Venezuela as we speak. All South American countries do. The problem is Chavez applied socialism so US punished Venezuela with sanctions. But they still buy the oil anyway.
8160 2018-06-07 05:45:40 Don’t know if I suggested this to you before or not cause tbh I tell everyone haha but have you tried using coconut oil? As a moisturizer or as something to helps recuse acne
8161 2018-06-07 05:44:53 I do find it funny that we always end up back here. Those close to the Oilers quietly find a way to blame the AHL coach for not "developing & playing" kids more & yet the expectation is to win. Not real sure how that's a fair ask on any coach. Just plain dumb.

8177 2018-06-07 05:42:06 @milnoc in the news today: coming rise in airfares due to price of oil. Long hauls most affected. So you got a good deal on your flights compared to buying later.
8178 2018-06-07 05:42:05 Perhaps if children were born with a way get discounts on foreign oil that we spend billions of dollars per year buying from Canada, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, etc. Then the POTUS and Congress might take more of an interest in addressing school safety/gun violence.

8192 2018-06-07 05:38:18 Norway's determination to combat climate change would be more believable if they didn't keep awarding new oil licences. #hypocritical
8193 2018-06-07 05:38:16 WTI is used mainly in US markets while Brent is used more widely all over the world.  Malaysia has been using Brent for a long time and that is what our trading partners also use to benchmark oil prices. Which benchmark is used depends on the market you're in.

8212 2018-06-07 05:35:14 @jamesrhine Saw you got your wisdom teeth removed (nightmare!). If the pain is bad, speak to your dentist about clove oil, a traditional remedy. Eugenol, the active numbing ingredient in clove oil, numbs the nerves on contact, although researchers are not sure how it works.

8244 2018-06-07 05:30:03 Idk why people with long hair are taking hour long showers and struggling with combing their hair so much. It literally takes me a minute to brush out my hair and like 10 to shower. Sounds like you made your hair high maintenance. Just use gentle shampoos and oil when damp.

8532 2018-06-07 04:43:13 I smell like fryer oil and dirty dishes...
8533 2018-06-07 04:43:08 It's cool. I used a school word. It's a sauce. Sorta like a vinaigrette without the oil
8534 2018-06-07 04:43:08 I do have the same data and I found that only single use of any kind of oil is healthier than virgin oil. When you give the heat to the oil it's trans fat chains will break and it make a bond with the celiary enzyme cells in vessels and produce plaque.

8567 2018-06-07 04:36:36 No, Im just sick of people who’s trying to bring palm oil down because of the illegal logging. It’s just a propaganda against palm oil business while soy oil is far worse in terms of bringing damages to ecosystem.

8575 2018-06-07 04:35:58 I just worked a 16 hour work day running on 4 hours of sleep, got hopped up on 4+ coffees and slathered myself in CBD oil as soon as I got home AMA.

8577 2018-06-07 04:35:36 Murphy gets them too. But I just started at home remedies and one works super well. 
Heat coconut oil on the stove with a little bit of garlic clove in it. Let it hear for about 5 minutes. Cool a little and use a cotton ball to squeeze the slightly warm mixture in his ear

8605 2018-06-07 04:31:35 My dad went to a food show this week for work... 

Today he brought home 31 bottles of olive oil.

 What are we going to do with THIRTY-ONE. bottles. of. olive. oil? 
8606 2018-06-07 04:31:26 I am sure that is the reason, more so because he hasn't put tariffs on the countries that didn't like Obama! and then of course Russia because of his buddy Putin! The only reason he is bringing back coal Russia's main export oil, hmmmm
8607 2018-06-07 04:31:01 Sounds delightful. I use a  lime oil from @NaturesUltra and it definitely doesn’t take like a hamster cage

8614 2018-06-07 04:30:34 I note that you haven't replied to the question about PFOA on your bags. These questions might be easier to answer. Is PALM OIL in any of your products? Your butter flavor contains no butter but does it contain Proplyene Glycol? Is your beta carotene source natural or synthetic?
8615 2018-06-07 04:30:33 Burliuk was the father of a good friend’s wife, an aspiring artist himself, who has been on the path over thirty years. Coincidentally, my father purchased a Burliuk in 1967, a small oil which now hangs in my room, largely because he was a radical, a Marxist (not Groucho).

8843 2018-06-07 03:58:02 Government should stay out of the oil business. Look what happened under PET and his idiotic national energy program.

8903 2018-06-07 03:51:02 Repo rate now stands at 6.25%, first such increase in over 4 years, loans may get costlier to curb inflation from high oil prices. Move will translate into higher EMIs for Home, auto and other loans .....

8913 2018-06-07 03:49:26 Indeed you're not standing by. The MBIE advice that you ignored states that your oil/gas ban will increase C-emissions.
8914 2018-06-07 03:49:21 3. And what does the risk of a steep oil price rise have to do with the volume increase of subsidized gasoline for this year by about 4.3 million kiloliters to 11.8 million, as today's editorial has eloquently put it?

8993 2018-06-07 03:38:44 I'm sick of this bullpen. Plus the lack of fundamentals is frightening I don't think there is enough coconut oil to soothe these problems

8995 2018-06-07 03:38:26 Real or not, her 15 minutes are up... the world doesn't need another Tammy Layron.

dunk your entire head in a big jar of coconut oil !!! stuff does wonders
8997 2018-06-07 03:38:08 I think this jojoba oil broke my baby out. 
8998 2018-06-07 03:38:04 I think long term, oil will be a deficit market as the search spending in last few years is way down. Until there is alternative for production of plastics anyway. Grains is just starting. A lot of fundamentals left to play out in this market
8999 2018-06-07 03:38:01 Yeah, that’s #SCRuitt for ya, $50/night condo from which he was evicted for non-payment, spending millions of dollars wasting our money, but eating at the cafeteria saving us tons. He could be writing off lavish dinners with oil executives.

9015 2018-06-07 03:36:25 I just want to live in a world that isn’t so money hungry. Where health insurance companies don’t exist and taxes pay for any medical need you have. Where oil doesn’t run cars and renewable energy is encouraged. Where the president doesn’t try to sell T-shirts on his Twitter.

9027 2018-06-07 03:34:47 I pared down. Simple bar soap scrubs(with lots of massage) daily or every other day, frequent water rinses throughout the day, and simple oil if moisture is necessary. A washcloth for occasional exfoliation, a brush for more intense exfoliation.

So, Trumpers: Your God-King is either a liar or an idiot. Why doesnt that matter to you?
9070 2018-06-07 03:30:03 Only downside to using the oil can is that I can backfire easily since it can be knocked back by the enemy and forced to switch directions. It can also damage you with its explosion.

9077 2018-06-07 03:29:16 Been washing my hair less to repair my scalp and hair. I use rose oil, grape seed oil and lavender in between washes. My hair is happy. ♡♡♡♡
9078 2018-06-07 03:29:08 The way Kevin is playing, I want to take some raw shea butter oil and conditioner and slather on his head...then brush his hair for him.
9079 2018-06-07 03:29:07 I’ll just say that the oil can is your best friend since you can control it independently from your own movements meaning it’s a good pressuring and zone control device.
9080 2018-06-07 03:28:47 I've applied to a job, changed my oil, and had an interview today while I'm working on my blog and the story of my D&D campaign. It feels good to be home, but after today...I'm tired.

9083 2018-06-07 03:28:32 Wow, yet another lie. Travel from Baton Rouge to New Orleans on the Mississippi River. Crude oil, natural gas, fuel oil, coal & other forms of "energy" have been exported for more than a decade.

9089 2018-06-07 03:27:07 Well our medical is drastically changing because trudope has put illegals before Canadians , destroyed the oil companies which contributed to the liberals spending spree.  Your debt was huge way befor President Trump.
9090 2018-06-07 03:27:06 I must say. Have you lost your mind? The Chinese are going to leapfrog us in clean renewable energy all so you can make sure your oil buddies make more money. 500 days of greatness my ass.

9103 2018-06-07 03:26:10 People a lot smarter than you and I are saying it is man made. What qualifies you to decide that they don't know what they are talking about? Yes, we need oil for a while, but there is no reason that we also can't start implementing a green plan. Need to get rid of coal first

9106 2018-06-07 03:25:51 It will keep ABs oil in the ground, which will be replaced from other sources to meet demand. Stopping TMX doesn't solve any problems, it simply puts Canada at an economic disadvantage. CDN companies can produce at lower GHG per barrel than OPEC. CC is a global problem, yes?

9124 2018-06-07 03:24:18 Russia is rich in energy resources. Russia has the largest known natural gas reserves of any state on earth, along with the second largest coal reserves, and the eighth largest oil reserves.
9125 2018-06-07 03:24:16 My sister told me to put cooking oil on my acne so the sun can cook them dry...my dumbass might try it
9126 2018-06-07 03:24:14 Cut off the Oil Supply from Western Canada to the USA! Trump is an Embarrassment and has Insulted Canada 
9127 2018-06-07 03:24:06 You can’t be serious Westy. This would be a dream deal for the Oil
9128 2018-06-07 03:23:22 I have a home in a mountain villlage in Mexico. No kidding. My dad has stage 4 cancer in his bones. Only uses cbd oil for pain. Very affordable there. Good luck!

9130 2018-06-07 03:22:49 Perhaps as the  Head Clown of the Trump Travelling Circus and Snake Oil Show.
9131 2018-06-07 03:22:30 They will say they plan to keep oil output flat, but compliance at certain Gulf OPEC and Central Asian OPEC+ nations will weaken in Q3
9132 2018-06-07 03:22:25 Wait another fucking two months for him to actually get this title shit taken care of, then by all means, pour hot oil on his body.
9133 2018-06-07 03:22:23 No just blood and oil and candles and a sweet saxophone solo.
9134 2018-06-07 03:22:22 I know you probably won't see this, buuut anyheww...

1/2 cup cold water 
Pinch of cayenne pepper 
1 drop clove oil
2 drops peppermint oil 

The pepper burns and the clove numbs your mouth for like a half hour , but gargling with it a couple times a day actually helps. 
9135 2018-06-07 03:22:17 "I’d put my money on the sun and #solar energy. What a source of power! I hope we don’t have to wait until oil & coal run out before we tackle that." Edison, 1931

We have the solutions. Isn't it time we chose panels not pipelines?

9141 2018-06-07 03:20:44 Especially because I can get my oil changed and tires rotated for $50 if I chose to
9142 2018-06-07 03:20:44 ugh i accidentally dropped a piece of the pork in the oil and it splashed on me and i got a few burns
9143 2018-06-07 03:20:35 Why blaming earmarks for wasteful spending, and then "abolishing" them, was a gimmick. There was greater accountability for foolish spending decisions when we had earmarks
9144 2018-06-07 03:20:28 If they're gonna go ahead and thieve Golan oil, they've gotta make like they're fully committed to the place, y'know?

9152 2018-06-07 03:19:23 Wow! I actually saw your tweet! The salad though? Where's the Feta or Bleu cheese?? Olive oil??  Red wine vinegar?/Kosher/Sea Salt- oh wow! I'm making a great NON vegan salad to go with my steak! LOL
9153 2018-06-07 03:19:20 Oops, sorry I hit the 'like' by accident.  Are the growing economies of China, India, and Africa climate change deniers?  They don't seem to be too concerned.  Let's help them with ethical oil.
9154 2018-06-07 03:19:16 Libya had crude oil and a small population, what do we have? He left a country without skills and poorly educated

9156 2018-06-07 03:19:10 What if it was true? Most critics on here dont or can't take criticism even if its very obvious.
9157 2018-06-07 03:19:08 Date night with Bob Ross! My first experience with oil paint, it was fun! Kent’s is the one with the cabin
9158 2018-06-07 03:18:46 Maybe if they would try to work with Israel for peace, instead of indicting riots, get some economic help from their Arab brothers in the oil rich Muslim Arab countries, they can improve their lives. But, it's all a cover. Basically, they just hate Israel & want to destroy it.
9159 2018-06-07 03:18:42 Yikes!  At least it was sunscreen and not the baby oil we used to broil in.

9165 2018-06-07 03:17:15 thick  @Kaybuwai_
9166 2018-06-07 03:17:14 Rail is at capacity, so yes not adding more capacity through more pipelines will absolutely keep oil in the ground.

And OPECs environmental standards are irrelevant if we intend to ship raw bitumen to Asian markets with no environmental standards either.
9167 2018-06-07 03:17:12 I'd also b happy2stop attacking countries for their oil & just use our own as well as seek alternatives; that would save enough defense (attack) spending to fix our insolvent bankrupt status(that we should have if the ratings agencies were not biased/helping avoid petro$ collapse

9177 2018-06-07 03:15:19 Mr. Weaver, do you really need to make false claims?  You're too good for this.  China is consuming oil and gas at increasing rates. It's nonsense to claim they lead on anything environmental.  Ask @cathmckenna who pollutes the oceans the most with plastic (hydrocarbon product).

9183 2018-06-07 03:13:33 How will the oil get there you tree huggers? Grow up. Oil is here to stay. Not everyone can afford a Tesla or the Hydro Rates to charge it to “save the planet”. You know what will save the planet? Condoms. Not granola bars.

9225 2018-06-07 03:06:14 So every scientific group and developed country disagrees with you and apparently so does the ceo of Canada’s largest oil company.
9226 2018-06-07 03:06:06 I keep my bottle of peppermint oil near me. I used to get really bad 4-day food allergy headaches. Now I just get regular stress headaches. But the oil is good for hot summer days or sore muscles, too!
9227 2018-06-07 03:06:01 I get migraines too. Have you ever tried Olbas Oil? Applied to a warm compress or on pillow the scent really helps. It has a menthol scent that is very helpful.

9231 2018-06-07 03:04:56 People get upset by this every so often. First it was oil rich Arabs that were buying up everything. Then it was the Japanese who were buying up everything. Now it's the PRC buying up land. 
They can't box up the land and ship it home. Let them buy!

9251 2018-06-07 03:01:24 Not building TMX doesn't keep oil in the ground, it just increases shipment by rail, which has a higher frequency of spills from derailment & create more emissions.

9264 2018-06-07 03:00:15 I interchange protector with advocate or speaking for the flora and fauna. When proponents of oil and gas call conservationists Eco terrorists and other villainous labels I know they're resorting to name calling because they're afraid!

9276 2018-06-07 02:58:13 i have a hypothesis that trump, putin, & bibi have been in cahoots. i think they want iran’s oil & ports & they’ll take it by force if necessary. i think putin wants to rebuild ussr & take georgia, armenia, azurbaijan & iran. maybe xi, KJU & MbS are in on it too.

all egomaniacs.
9277 2018-06-07 02:58:06 Some takeaways from REN21 2018 report: vast majority of global fuel needs within the transport sector are still met by oil (92%), with small proportions met by biofuels (2.8%) and electricity (1.3%).

9280 2018-06-07 02:57:42 It’s not just poppies.  It’s between iran and china.  Prevents oil flow that direction.  Four of our bases are right on pipelines.
9281 2018-06-07 02:57:40 Also, 40% of USA oil imports come from... you guessed it, Canada.

9295 2018-06-07 02:55:07 I see, BP and the Saxe-Coburg globalists installed the Shaw, to steal the oil and wealth of Iran, I agree with you on that point

But it is the Royals who owe them reperations... not the American taxpayers and their Muslim Manchurian candidate installed by the media

9319 2018-06-07 02:50:44 1.1 billion autos in the world and growing by 80 million per yr. Oil will be around until there isn't a drop which is a minimum of 500 years from now. People watch too much tv and beleve all this bullshit. It is complete nonsense.
9320 2018-06-07 02:50:02 To prep the Emperor Bulblax tongue for cooking, marinate in olive oil and chop into cubes.

9326 2018-06-07 02:49:20 Almost certainly they are wrong and are lieing. Venezuela is a major oil player and the people want to organize and use their resources for their own collective well being? That’s a no bueno.
9327 2018-06-07 02:49:19 You forgot about robbing the poor, giving to rich. Taking small children from the arms of their mothers and putting them in cages. Allowing the fleecing of we the people by trash like Pruitt. Trashing green energy to line your and your sycophants pockets with big oil money.

9342 2018-06-07 02:46:43 $250 out the window just like that bc of an oil change, gas, your phone bill, your gym bill, and groceries. Not VS or bed bath and beyond or anything u actually want to buy :( #adultthings

Silly argument.
9357 2018-06-07 02:44:41 Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome is different from the plant allergy. It's true that only a hot shower/bath will help - know someone who smoked for years but this happened twice only when both booze & ingestible oil were consumed. Could it be the combination or just too much thc?
9358 2018-06-07 02:44:36 From what I know, deforesting to plant more palm plants for palm oil production is what is causing this.
9359 2018-06-07 02:44:21 This coconut oil smells horrible

9410 2018-06-07 02:36:53 I think it is a smart strategy by Saudi Arabia. Instead of ending cuts or announcing more #oil to the market, they ship more to US ahead of meeting to quell prices; knowing that US inventories is what dictates price just as they helped drain them. Brilliant short term strategy.
9411 2018-06-07 02:36:41 obviously they just want their oil

9424 2018-06-07 02:35:22 Well you can’t drink oil so best to just keep it in the soil & water is life without a clean source there is none. Not to mention money isn’t everything plus I’m sure the people can’t afford the cleanup as much histories of oilspills due to inappropriate monitoring/maintenance
9425 2018-06-07 02:35:09 Do you even get economics? I am going with no. Because Ford can't do a thing about gas, it goes from $1.26 in Barrie to $1.34 hours later and repeat everyday. Oil companies dictate pricing, not goverment.1/2

Petrol and diesel prices were cut by 9 paise and 8 paise respectively today. Petrol now costs Rs 85.45 in Mumbai and diesel costs Rs 73.17, according to the data available on Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.’s website

9431 2018-06-07 02:34:19 So interesting to see the media concern over the threat to Iraq - Iran fuel trade if the JCPOA goes. Iraq has been importing Iranian gas and oil way before the P5+1. That border is notional at best; previous Governor of Najaf only spoke Farsi.

9437 2018-06-07 02:33:59 Another fake news from nytimes. Not the whole story morons. 

You're partly correct, America exports a great deal oil, oil not allowed to be used in America because it's low grade and not allowed to be used do to epa regulations. To dirty. It's sold to China, no rules there.

9460 2018-06-07 02:29:58 The longer the oil and gas sector remains a marginal business, the higher the price will be in the future. Also, the longer it stays like this, the faster and bigger the supply crunch will be.

9499 2018-06-07 02:23:15 TBH it’s the GDP game. Oil companies shored up and figured out how to make money off less. End result is an increase in GDP which they use to say the economy is up. This is why measuring GDP is a false flag for middle class income.

9550 2018-06-07 02:16:59 "The oil patch states include Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Louisiana." I've heard of Kansas for the federal reserve and Texas. I don't know the other 2 states.
9551 2018-06-07 02:16:57 It makes me cringe when I watch makeup vids where they put on oil, highlight, then foundation, concealer and cream contour. Like sis u might look good but that cannot feel good all at once

9555 2018-06-07 02:16:28 There’s a good truck that does in midtown, although they don’t quite have enough salt and oil in the mix in my opinion.
9556 2018-06-07 02:16:26 You cannot make the assumption that govt will be a benefit without an industrial tax base. Otherwise we become a commodity based economy like the oil nations of the Middle East, and ultimately collapse.

Me: So... Basically the duration of a normal flu ...
9567 2018-06-07 02:15:00 Mm, as I said I'm not great at politics and I really know nothing about Irish politics- I can only speak for Scotland! I think we could have been alright but then the oil at Aberdeen ran out (??) So I really don't know. I believe Scotland COULD be self-sufficient.
9568 2018-06-07 02:14:59 Yeah and t-Rump lowered every ones taxes, and the U.S. is the #1 oil producer in the WHOLE WIDE WORLD! What's up with that Donny?

9571 2018-06-07 02:14:50 @JustinTrudeau FYI...doing "what's right" for the country is doing what's right for the climate. W/out change Canada will have to continue to spend exponentially on disaster relief, etc. So it actually is EITHER/OR. There is no more oil w/out destroying the planet & you know it!

1/2 cup of kernels cooked in a covered pan.

Add coconut oil and 3 kernels.  When the first kernel pops add the rest.  Add oil and seasonings when popping is done.

Throw-away the microwave cancer.

9580 2018-06-07 02:13:33 I think there's some oil and fishing rights, but none of that would eradicate the infestation we have, nor would it fix the economy (especially if the parasites retain some power).
9581 2018-06-07 02:13:33 The Canadian tariffs are to kick in July 1.  Idea is to give him time reconsider.  Mnuchin has said Canada should be excepted, but obvisously Trump cannot admit to a mistake so who knows.  Maybe if Canada just turned off the flow of oil/gas?
9582 2018-06-07 02:13:30 But don't you see what I've done for the Transmission oils. I've done so much how could i, a transmission oil specialist do something bad to transmission oil.

9599 2018-06-07 02:11:07 The suit by the state oil company is good for the nation. Let there be clarity on how the precious black gold be administered. The state shouldn’t cry foul but instead put their arguement based on what they think is right. Rule of law.

How many “Alpha” guys on here do, or have done, what is considered a traditional physical male job?

Construction? Law enforcement? Oil field work? Firefighter?

A few seem to spew “Alpha” a lot from their keyboards, only. 

Just an observation.

9651 2018-06-07 02:04:38 What I find fascinating is that with those prod. figures (250 to 400 Mbbls/d) someone (in their right mind ??) would sign contracts for 1.27 MMbbls/d of that same crude. Too naive or misinformed (dangerous in oil ind.) or 'on the take'...Happens when politics come into oil deals

9679 2018-06-07 02:01:04 Fracking causes air and water pollution, increases the potential for oil spills, which can harm the soil and surrounding vegetation and may cause earthquakes due to the high pressure used to extract oil and gas from rock and the storage of excess wastewater on site.

9691 2018-06-07 01:59:23 Too bad you made fun of Hawaiian volcano damage. How do you think other states will feel about bailing out Louisiana from more storms enhanced by CLIMATE CHANGE and OIL INDUSTRY destruction of the coast?
9692 2018-06-07 01:59:14 Bath tip: if you get to the last few drops of fragrance or essential oil that won't come out of the bottle, put some sea salt in, shake it well, and pow, you have scented bath salts.

(Also works with flavor extracts such as vanilla, though the scent will not be as strong.)

9702 2018-06-07 01:57:38 I doubt the auto manufacturers will allow the oil companies to this party.  It's not like BP would have access to OEM battery packs. And warranty issues would preclude using aftermarket packs. Also, rapid expansion of EV market is going to strain battery manufacturing capacity.

9710 2018-06-07 01:56:36 One might argue that the failure of "centrist" Liberals, Democrats, etc. to adopt progressive policies has contributed to the political vacuum and disaffection which demagogues like Ford, Trump etc. have seized upon to sell their snake oil, which benefits only their 1% sponsors.

9721 2018-06-07 01:55:28 Lol The Alberta NDP inherited 9 billion in debt from decades of conservative govts genius.  9 billion $ deficit, after RECORD high oil prices. Hello corruption!   Notley took over as oil had tanked.  But ya, those NDP....
9722 2018-06-07 01:55:15 This isn’t a Party thing...the fact is Trump has done a lot to help the black community. This racist nonsense is just that...nonsense.  I voted Trump because of what he wasn’t...a smooth talking snake oil salesman.  That’s just my opinion.

9756 2018-06-07 01:48:53 Everything I said is facts. Not even opinions. Simple mathematical facts.

I don't "believe" it. I simply accept it. I plan around it.

Oil is the cheapest energy source, because we don't have to make it. We cash our energy savings.

9790 2018-06-07 01:44:11 The oil production is a function of crude oil prices.  The price of gas is dictated by capacity of refineries, taxes, and public demand.  One way or another - 8% inflation in energy costs is eating up most of tax savings.
9791 2018-06-07 01:43:45 When I had my rear molar pulled I used a water/tea tree oil solution for gum pain. I was really pleased with the results. I used it undiluted on a wart on my arm. It dried it out over a couple of weeks to where it crumbled apart.

9796 2018-06-07 01:43:33 Seriously, you mean to tell me it wouldn’t be cheaper to just use potatoes, salt, sugar, lime juice and vegetable oil in it? I get why sugar is in it, because that’s what holds the line salt together. But c’mon Frito Lay.

9808 2018-06-07 01:41:25 If coconut oil & a pick counts then .. yea
9809 2018-06-07 01:40:53 Very true. But who is to see we would receive anything in return. Nothing is for certain. It would be a great impact on the economy to bring in more oil and different metal alloys but it’s not worth the risk of not receiving anything if they don’t agree to a foreign trade policy

9820 2018-06-07 01:39:39 Sounds weird, wash less. Dry scalp is actually a sign of over washing (as is over oily hair.) Youre stripping too much moisture so your follicles are panicking to add it back, and overproducing. I use morrocan oil. Rub it in, let it soak. Do it on a day off -
9821 2018-06-07 01:39:39 Because governments everywhere are corrupt and are on the side of the loggers & palm oil. Especially Indonesia & Malaysua. Tragic greed & corruption.
9822 2018-06-07 01:39:38 This ad for Belgard backyards is infuriating. 

1. You don’t pour olive oil willy nilly on a hot grill or...

It’s a grill, not a fire pit.
9823 2018-06-07 01:39:15 Romney is an out of touch with reality elitist. I’ll bet he couldn’t pump gas, check his oil, or put air in his tires.
9824 2018-06-07 01:39:02 It’s oil about oil.
9825 2018-06-07 01:39:01 It's trippy.  And they pulled it off.  The scene, I mean.  Not the junk.

9837 2018-06-07 01:37:28 Adding the scented oils to the bath he grabs some fluffy towels and rests them on the vanity. “All set and I added some vanilla scented oil to help. Come here.” He walks over and leans down taking your hands in his to pull you up. “It’s just us, you’re safe...we both are.”

9850 2018-06-07 01:35:03 This is not new.  Google bought oil rigs for this effect as well.  Off shore and away from US jurisdiction, google pumped deep sea water to environmentaly cool data centers.  And it was extremely effective.

9855 2018-06-07 01:34:17 Venezuela would probably be the richest country on the planet (regardless of economic system) if the population was 90% Nordic or Germanic. It has more oil reserves than Saudi Arabia. The racial demographics are the root problem, not "socialism" per se.
9856 2018-06-07 01:34:10 Things are going just the way #Trump wants in the EPA. #Pruitt disgraced; staff bailing, regulations dismantled. Trump'll dismantle agency saying it's not functioning. Big oil, gas, mining companies who donate to Trump will celebrate! #maddow

9858 2018-06-07 01:33:28 I had a congenital heart rhythm that was making my heart go into afib if I didn't eat enough starch. I got that fixed in August. I've lost 49 pounds since then, 268 to 219. I eat eggs and olive oil every morning for breakfast. Sometimes that's all I'll eat... like today. LOL
9859 2018-06-07 01:33:24 I didn’t think so. On closer inspection they’re offering free samples of CBD oil, so maybe that’s different than straight up bud, legality wise.
9860 2018-06-07 01:33:19 I bought some tea tree oil because it’s supposed to be good for cuts but I don’t know about this stuff. It smells awful.

9868 2018-06-07 01:32:03 Thanks Toren. Its actually pretty hard to filter through all the information out there. But I feel like if lithium turns into the next "big oil," those of us who take the time to educate ourselves will do quite well. Need to sort through the real operators and the promos.
9869 2018-06-07 01:31:55 First order of business for @fordnation is to double refining capacity in Sarnia using the finest quality oil from our friends in Alberta. Conservatives are patriots who love their country coast to coast. #FordNation #Ford4Premier
9870 2018-06-07 01:31:52 honestly try coconut oil  and a curl gel when your hair is wet. A small bottle  of coconut oil lasted me months and the giant one was only $15
9871 2018-06-07 01:31:44 I live in a state where medical marijuana is not available.  When in AZ, I stock up on CBD Oil for my chronic pain. 

The oil does  NOT  make me high, but eliminates the constant pain I deal with every day.

It's time  ALL  Americans have access to cannabis oil !

9874 2018-06-07 01:31:38 It's just a guess mind you, but it is feasible to me that Mr. Pruitt, allowing for his scientific reasoning capacity, wanted this item in reserve for the next off-shore oil rig leak.Just stuff it into hole on ocean floor.If it works Mr P. stands to make a slick $1 or 2 reselling.

9884 2018-06-07 01:29:33 When I get a weird cut or acne breakout, coconut oil MAGICALLY makes it clear up at like a 30-50% faster rate. Give it a try! Best of luck, gal 
9885 2018-06-07 01:29:28 I use applesauce all the time instead of oil. Works well. 

When kids were small I made all their food, froze it in ice cube trays (I know,thought I could do it all, working full time & #BeBest ) used applesauce as sweetener and thickener. No regrets.

9902 2018-06-07 01:27:04 Agree with Gary. A nice bast with oil. We like to grill with no seasoning then add to a scampi. Little butter, lemon, red pepper flakes in a nice al dente fettuccine.
9903 2018-06-07 01:26:39 I'm not saying pipelines are utopia but crude oil by rail is very dangerous especially if they don't use the latest in tanker cars. Google the number of derailment and subsequent disasters. It's a lot more than you might think.
9904 2018-06-07 01:26:34 @DFriesenGlobal Great interview w/ @JustinTrudeau. If you get another chance, can you ask who would be liable if an oil tanker leaked oil in Vancouver waters _after_ leaving KM terminal. No one seems to be able to tell me.

9968 2018-06-07 01:17:03 Time to collect I believe they have some titanium mines and oil wells as a introduction offering to USA.
9969 2018-06-07 01:16:59 Find a drug store and purchase some peppermint essential oil or lavender essential oil and some cotton balls. Spiders can't stand either scent.
9970 2018-06-07 01:16:57 @Ford guess what ford!  Your oil pans leak!  When is the recall?
9971 2018-06-07 01:16:55 Poland: NBP will probably keep policy unchanged into 2020 - Gov Adam Glapinski reiterated, adding that rising oil prices already pushed CPI higher

9972 2018-06-07 01:16:50 Yo I just made some bomb as jasmine rice and I literally only added coconut oil, onions, and garlic. Shit has me about to make myself some more 
9973 2018-06-07 01:16:44 Do you remember the code the CEL pulled? Oil leaks and major tune ups are definitely good ways for the shop to make money. If you can get some more info for me, we can diag it, and see if you can save some money.
9974 2018-06-07 01:16:38 Yep. No matter what you say to some these people, they're just gonna keep digging, digging, digging 'till they think they've struck oil.
9975 2018-06-07 01:16:35 i’ve only used this oil twice & its AMAZINGG!!
9976 2018-06-07 01:16:32 Trump has done worse to our country than the Valdez's oil. Let the slippery old fool own it. He hasn't tried to stop it, has he?
9977 2018-06-07 01:16:27 Think of the lead, oil etc leaching into the river.
9978 2018-06-07 01:16:27 This hot oil treatment is giving me life  scalp tingling .
9979 2018-06-07 01:16:25 If you're a Goddess as I am, do you have an altar to yourself? Mine would have green tea with apple juice, cats, and clove oil.
9980 2018-06-07 01:16:22 Your head get oil 
9981 2018-06-07 01:15:49 Aren't they the ones that keep sending us the cold air in the winter so we have to import more oil from them. SON OF A BITCH!
9982 2018-06-07 01:15:47 Just got this fragrance oil. Gotta make me some body glow oil to try it out. I need those shimmery shoulders like y’all got.
9983 2018-06-07 01:15:40 I was never a big fan but I did appreciate her acting ability.

9986 2018-06-07 01:15:11 Nothing beats a quick 30min brine ( 1tsp kosher salt in 2c H2O)  then grill with butter & garlic — if shell on, 2X brine time and oil before grilling
9987 2018-06-07 01:14:48 He imposed dollar for dollar tariffs. The dollar figure difference is literally zero. Also, it would be a brutal decision to run the wheels off the oil price.
9988 2018-06-07 01:14:32 My check engine light came on, my oil light blinking and it’s full, ima blow this car up
9989 2018-06-07 01:14:29 Love and politics, oil and water.
9990 2018-06-07 01:14:17 “Does the US need to ‘give’ oil and gas companies billions.....”? With a tax break, nobody is “giving” you anything. You keep more of what is yours.

9992 2018-06-07 01:14:03 I don't care if he personally sent the tweets or not. It's a "the captain of the ship is responsible" thing. Hazelwood was in his stateroom when the Exxon Valdez had that terrible oil spill, but his name will be forever the name associated with it, not the ones at the wheel.
9993 2018-06-07 01:14:02 Is Cannabis oil Homeopathy? There appears to be a lot of anecdotal evidence of this appears to cure certain ailments. Not to be discounted,
9994 2018-06-07 01:13:49 How about standing up to @realDonaldTrump’s opening oil drilling on *all* American waters?  Until you can actually show you aren’t just throwing red meat to your constituents and licking the prez’s boots I’ll only trust @holden2018 with Florida’s waters. CC: @EdKrassen
9995 2018-06-07 01:13:39 White people are clowns bro. Someone spray anointing oil on them

9998 2018-06-07 01:13:14 For me Steve Kelly, read all the bs in the papers and expected great a player. Been sceptical of most Oil drafts since then.
9999 2018-06-07 01:13:12 Just use baby oil and you are good to go
10000 2018-06-07 01:12:57 Betty Crocker’s fudge brownies fucking suck. Too much oil.
10001 2018-06-07 01:12:49 This is a really low point for Oz. He should be nominated for the 'snake oil salesman' of the year and his medical credentials revoked. Even village idiot knows that astrological signs have nothing to do with health

10003 2018-06-07 01:12:24 Theyre currently coated in baby oil 
10004 2018-06-07 01:12:16 High oil can slow the economy by forcing businesses pay more to produce and ship goods, raising the prices for the consumer. Then we start spending less on stuff because wages don’t increase to cover high oil...
10005 2018-06-07 01:12:16 It is but it’s just water! Switching to something stronger once this coconut oil conundrum is solved!
10006 2018-06-07 01:12:15 oil the cogs and become a machine further
10007 2018-06-07 01:12:11 @FordService the question of the day! What is ford going to do about their failed leaking oil pans?  Big issues, mine was replace 4 times and still leaking.  Everyone with an oil leak = lemon law....  unless ford does a recall now with a fix that works!
10008 2018-06-07 01:12:00 You meet some of the chillest guys in the oil field
10009 2018-06-07 01:11:53 He wants to flog that old oil horse into the ground

10017 2018-06-07 01:10:32 EPA Pruitt is a baby crook next to Wilber Ross, our Sec. of Commerce. Ross has deep ties to the banking and oil cartels who have a globalist, perpetual war, One-World-Order agenda.
10018 2018-06-07 01:10:23 Digging the coconut oil out with a knife! It’s pretty slow-going. Going to pause because my hands are getting too greasy to tweet!
