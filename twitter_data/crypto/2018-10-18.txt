4 2018-10-18 23:59:28 I worked with two software developers in 2012 and they sold me on it then. It took a couple years before I made the jump to crypto addict.

6 2018-10-18 23:58:36 You'd think Roubini would consider these little factors before he denounces the entire sphere as BS. He must be trolling at a high level for some reason, no way he is as dumb about crypto as he seems.
7 2018-10-18 23:58:31 Unless they literally buy every bitcoin... I don't see how they can hijack it... That's the point of crypto. Regulation is the only threat. Even then I think people will find ways around it.
8 2018-10-18 23:58:09 Stellar. First crypto to make gains off of. And has one of the best charts
9 2018-10-18 23:58:06 The VC approach to crypto is to buy a basket of tokens early hoping a few take off. They fail to recognize that the world doesnâ€™t need 1,000 ways to digitize value, which is all public blockchains are good for. Forcing crypto into the old VC model will prove a costly mistake.
10 2018-10-18 23:58:02 HOW one is supposed to differentiate? Crypto start-ups became a some sort of.....commodity?!
11 2018-10-18 23:57:47 I'm not here to argue he said she said hearsay this that or the other on Tether. 

You make comments about price, I'm going to talk price. 

Your notion that $crypto MUST have been supported by fraudulent tether to deflate so much (800bn to 200bn) is absolute bollocks.
12 2018-10-18 23:57:44 I'm very picky when it comes to crypto. I wish to support a project if only the idea is striking and the team is super qualified. This project seems to be the one to trust into! #Integrity #IntegrityONE @IntegrityOne_ai
13 2018-10-18 23:56:59 this is crypto horny
14 2018-10-18 23:56:58 Yes but he was contradicting his own statement. Peace 
15 2018-10-18 23:56:49 Absolutely Correct. Don't look at your portfolio Daily. And yes #Crypto does need new Money And it will come maybe in a year or so. Then The Bulls Will Run Crazy.
16 2018-10-18 23:56:14 I was waiting to see how long it took! Thank you!!
17 2018-10-18 23:56:03 Lolz preach
18 2018-10-18 23:55:48 Tron takeover next bull run. Absolute sleeping giant of crypto. Mark it.
