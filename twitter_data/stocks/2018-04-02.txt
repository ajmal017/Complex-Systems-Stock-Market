38 2018-04-02 23:54:10 They already have. Ponzi schemes feigning private equity. They control our boards and exchanges. @NYSE, take many NYSE American stocks, as a general matter, low volume = red flag
39 2018-04-02 23:53:37 How about stocks test 2018  lows...I have an essay tweet that could follow
40 2018-04-02 23:53:18 Vast  majority of Americans can't afford a $400 emergency. Fewer than 15% of the country owns stocks. Housing values b/c of 08? Tanked to the basement. I can testify the so called job market? At a standstill. We never recovered from the 03 recession much less 08.
41 2018-04-02 23:53:09 I’ll bet there are a number of Trump supporters that are saying, it really doesn’t matter, because they don’t own stocks.
They should wake up and look at the status of their 401k.
MAGA should be hanged to #MAAJ , Make America A Joke! He’s winning!
42 2018-04-02 23:53:08 Been playing with these stocks and shit I gotta take it more serious
43 2018-04-02 23:53:06 I agree on the bump stocks. I personally think they are just a way to skirt around existing laws and they serve no purpose. But the argument over 30 round magazine's is pretty pointless. If someone has it in their mind to shoot up a place then they are going to. It doesn't matter
44 2018-04-02 23:53:01 @debiloto where do you see junior mining stocks on ASX going in 2018?
45 2018-04-02 23:52:51 I agree and DT should take his credit for stocks tanking.

50 2018-04-02 23:51:40 @realDonaldTrump -Hope YOU/YOUR 'friends' lose MULTIPLE BILLIONS of $s. None of the lies you spread about companies so you can short stocks will help. You guys were already reported to SEC for giving inside info to your buds who acted on that info & profited. Eyes are on you!

58 2018-04-02 23:50:04 How soon should we file a class action lawsuit against you for causing the market to tank and in particular tech stocks? How much did you and your Wall Street buddies make from shorting the stocks you attacked? #Grifter45
59 2018-04-02 23:49:52 How are sales and pre orders for Tesla ?

I just follow them from a stock perspective and their ups and downs have an impact on Lithium stocks
60 2018-04-02 23:49:10 Trump using his office to manipulate the stock market & that is dangerous to our economy.  He is purposely causing stocks to tumble on company that did not support him for President. Whereas giant Walmart gets a pass on his criticism bc gave him money.
61 2018-04-02 23:48:50 I sure hope someone is watching Trump's friends short sell the stocks he attacks.
62 2018-04-02 23:48:47 The stocks also do speak for themselves. If we were to break down what athletes each company had, sure.. Nike has majority of them. Like I said, I am still a Nike guy because my favorite athletes are on there.
63 2018-04-02 23:48:45 How would that have helped at Vegas? Yet bump stocks weren't addressed until parkland students started making a fuss. The NRA stopped caring about 2A long ago. They are just about marketing now.
64 2018-04-02 23:48:26 When stocks retreat so do the websites.
65 2018-04-02 23:48:13 Hey @CalSTRS & @CalPERS! I support @CalTreasurer's initiative to divest from companies that make and sell bump stocks and similar dangerous accessories that can turn a semi-automatic weapon into an automatic one! #DivestForOurLives #DefundGuns #DrainTheNRA
66 2018-04-02 23:47:43 How is it that just because DJT mean tweeted Amazon, their stocks dropped hard. Or was it because China responded to DJT's Tariffs with tariffs?  I'm hoping that the stock market has learned not to react to what he says and only react to what his administration says.
67 2018-04-02 23:47:31 The US has screwed itself by running deficits to spend on a military it can’t afford and to secure cheap oil on which its economy depends. China holds US$3T in reserves - watch it buy US stocks as the DOW falls and the $ falls while the US continues to buy Chinese goods #MAGA
68 2018-04-02 23:46:20 Look, I agree with common sense gun laws:  Raise the age, ban bump stocks; and limit the number of bullets in a magazine.  However, there's just one problem.  The United States has one thing NO OTHER COUNTRY HAS.  A 2nd Amendment.  We are one of a kind.

71 2018-04-02 23:45:12 It shouldn't though. As the likelihood of the tax cut passing increased, stocks rallied. But once it passed, that was it. All the increased corporate earnings were priced. There was no reason to think stocks would *keep* going up.
72 2018-04-02 23:45:04 Number of leading stocks today: 11 $SPY $QQQ $FB $GOOG $AMZN $GOOG $AAPL #DailyStkLeaderCount
73 2018-04-02 23:45:00 Logically, Canadian cannabis stocks should be unaffected by the market fluctuations due to the Trump effect; unfortunately, that’s not the case, and so I’m afraid you’re entirely correct. 

Just take a look at CGOC to see how little sense the market makes in this sector.
74 2018-04-02 23:44:53 In 2016, stocks had their WORST beginning in HISTORY. All’s well that ends well.  #StockTradersAlmanac
75 2018-04-02 23:44:17 What's going on? I haven't been keeping up? Is it because of stocks tanking?
76 2018-04-02 23:44:15 You should check Adidas stocks, and Nikes stocks. I'm not going to argue lol. This is my opinion, so whatever you have to say, at the end of the day... this is my opinion.

78 2018-04-02 23:43:44 But wats the point if weed stocks go green once in 7 days. I could care less if it goes green tomorrow because after that it will be red 3-4 days straight
79 2018-04-02 23:43:17 And how much you wanna bet Trump's cronies sold Amazon stock with advance knowledge that Trump was going on the warpath.
Just like he did with steel, aluminum and auto stocks when he announced tariffs.

83 2018-04-02 23:40:11 NOOOOOO! Wait until I sell off my stocks. lol
84 2018-04-02 23:39:52 Bump stocks are NOT banned, and are nowhere close to being banned.
85 2018-04-02 23:39:37 my gains would have been so sick for stocks but i thought i had to hodl cause they were tame for crypto
86 2018-04-02 23:39:34 I knew it was a good thing to buy asian stocks awhile ago.  these american ones ain't gonna last. :p
87 2018-04-02 23:39:18 All persons with Amazon stock should form a class action lawsuit against the orange menace -they definitely have a case! #AmazonPrime #StockMarket #stocks #TrumpIsAMoron #classactions
88 2018-04-02 23:39:13 Being long isn't some kind of badge of honor, if shit is going south im cashing out 95% of the time. Other 5% is cannabis stocks ;)
89 2018-04-02 23:39:07 (Guilty). I had huge gains in Jan but didn't take any profits cause I thought "this is crypto, not stocks" lol
90 2018-04-02 23:38:58 Following the #GOPTaxScam, corporations have approved over $225 billion in stock buybacks. This money overwhelmingly goes to wealthy shareholders & corporate executives, not into the pockets of hardworking Coloradans. 84% of stocks are owned by the top 10% of Americans. #coleg
91 2018-04-02 23:38:24 Amen. It’s bargain time. People should be buying the hell out of some of these stocks...
92 2018-04-02 23:38:13 I buy fractions of stocks through @stockpile and since Trump took on @amazon, I have lost about $50. 

That may not seem like much, but I make $11.50 working full time at a gas station.
93 2018-04-02 23:36:45 If u think abt it, even u could admit that banning semi-automatic guns, bump stocks and high capacity magazines is sensible. can’t pass the buck to parents students,  thats just absurd!! We can’t stop mentally ill people doing mass shootings it has to b through gun restrictions

96 2018-04-02 23:35:08 His buddies are probably shorting the stocks each time before he makes them drop down.
97 2018-04-02 23:34:41 Loose lips sink not only ships but also stocks, mr. President!
98 2018-04-02 23:34:37 No, it's actually not letting Trump burning the whole house down to the ground(you did see that the 2nd quarter stocks are at the worst level since the great depression today because of Trump's antics, right?)...
99 2018-04-02 23:34:33 Trump did shit. Stocks above expected still and predicted > 1800$ by the end of the year. Yes is up and down but Trumps whining on Tweeter isn't law.
100 2018-04-02 23:34:30 The past month has been very choppy and not good for micro-caps. This is why I tweet about taking profits during big runs ... stocks pumpers do the same, except don't admit as they want to always appear to be long.
101 2018-04-02 23:34:29 Wish I could afford to buy Amazon stocks right now!
102 2018-04-02 23:34:14 I'm beginning to think he likes when they drop. Example: Stocks on Monday crash 400 pts, Friday they recover those 400 points. That's when he goes out and says "Look how much the market rose today" Idiot.

108 2018-04-02 23:32:02 awesome high quality content as always. ty bro!  appreciate the after editing w/ charts and articles for the smooth viewing experience. doubt my guess is good for much lol but I’d say 1.32 trillion. I suppose if stocks take a hit, so will disposable flow into crypto.
109 2018-04-02 23:31:59 Howard knows when he leaves serius the stocks will plunge Into the toilet and Half his money with it so he is pinching every penny it’s why he can’t retire right now just keep an eye out for when he unloads that Sirius stock the end will be near
110 2018-04-02 23:31:15 stocks are down way to go, i see your not singing the stock market anymore because of course your the one who has caused it to happen so like always im sure your blaming it on other people or even trying to say its good for the country you damn train wreck of a potus.
111 2018-04-02 23:30:44 I hope those 1%ers haven’t lost too much on their stocks. That would be terrible.
112 2018-04-02 23:30:28 I m sure @elonmusk must be super bold to be making this prank Martin especially with #Tesla stocks trading at this level. @MHiesboeck
113 2018-04-02 23:30:27 There's little to no correlation with gold and miners. Gold bottomed in April 2013 & traded sideways till now. Gold stocks went down 40% twice.  Gold stocks had their worst period ever while energy prices were low (2014-16). They are failed b/c of the gold price model.
114 2018-04-02 23:30:20 I myself like the idea related elsewhere that we find a SEC lawyer and sue 45* for negative effect on our stocks. How about it @realDonaldTrump?  You ready to part with millions?
115 2018-04-02 23:30:15 Yes and nobody is perfect. Like teachers who decry corporate billionaires and also have their pensions tied up in the stocks of those companies (I love teachers, btw, just an easy example) but I think the problem is that Trump et al pretend to be perfect when they trash amazon.
116 2018-04-02 23:29:50 You might have to remind me how many stock market cliffs we went over during that economic expansion that’s been going on since 2010? We’ve had how many days of the stocks dipping by triple digits since last January? Also, it’s good that now you guys believe unemployment numbers.
117 2018-04-02 23:29:37 That’s a great call.  There is something Nasty going on in this market.  I think a lot of buying is coming from dirty foreign money (Russian kleptos) and the idea of him and Jared shorting particular stocks is good.  I think in early 2017 he owned a lot of Morgan Stanley stock
118 2018-04-02 23:28:43 You would be totally crazy to put money in the stock market until Trump is out of Power. He is going to burn the whole thing down. #DowJones #stocks #amazon
119 2018-04-02 23:28:28 Putting an optic, a laser sight, or a flashlight on that weapon doesn't make it any deadlier. None of those mods increase the rate of fire.

120 2018-04-02 23:27:34 Sell everything! Put in market orders on all your stocks before the market opens! Ahhhhhh!

123 2018-04-02 23:26:07 $spot..It is going to hard for tech stocks tomorrow. SPOT IPO might suck the life out of other stocks.

125 2018-04-02 23:25:47 Pretty incredible feed...stocks, charts, snark, and cats
126 2018-04-02 23:24:42 Headlines making "trade tensions" as a reason for the stocks plunge. Did they saw credit market yet?
127 2018-04-02 23:24:40 Amazon stocks down as a result of Trump’s harassing lies...  investors can sue him. DO IT....
128 2018-04-02 23:24:36 .04 is way too low for $DIRV. The potential for this company is insane. Leading provider for the cannabis industry and also getting contracts with HUGE companies outside of the cannabis industry.  Also, Canada is legalizing weed on July 1st. Just hold IMO
129 2018-04-02 23:21:45 I'm buying condos in the Caribbean, taking my movie out of stocks.
130 2018-04-02 23:21:40 Good morning traders

U.S. stocks had their worst April start since 1929

The S&P 500 index slumped 2.2% , a rout exceeded only by its 2.5%  decline 89 years ago, a prelude to the devastating crash later that year that brought on the Great Depression
131 2018-04-02 23:21:05 The market is in trouble Because of trump and Fox news .wall street going to loss all their stocks
132 2018-04-02 23:20:52 This is officially the worst start to the second quarter of the year for stocks since the Great Depression.

We just can't take all this winning!!
133 2018-04-02 23:20:25 The #cryptocurrency market is bearish as is the tech stock market with the nasdaq100 losing recently around 270 billion usd.Investors who lost in crypto could have sold some stocks to recoup their losses.There is a link between the crypto and the tech stock markets.
134 2018-04-02 23:20:06 I have to admit, part of me is really enjoying watching all these stocks tank, even though the rich fucks will just figure some new way of ringing their losses out of the rest of us.
135 2018-04-02 23:20:02 MadMen is playing with people's IRA 401 Stocks.
This madness must stop.

@POTUS
@realDonaldTrump @RealLouisCarter @congressdotgov
136 2018-04-02 23:19:42 #MAGAts don’t have stocks and aren’t educated enough to understand what the Dow is and how it affects their lives
137 2018-04-02 23:19:07 @realDonaldTrump Americans like Amazon & want stocks 2 go up, not down.They’re inclined 2 let Dreamers stay & don’t want major disruptions 2 the economy.Trump acts as if everything will work out, no matter how loudly he barks.There are a growing number of indicators he’s wrong.
138 2018-04-02 23:18:59 The only stocks that are going up must be apple pie and desserts - I’m eating like a fiend with all this insanity. #stockmarket #tarrifs #tradewar #democracy #firstamendment
139 2018-04-02 23:18:38 If you are heavily in stocks at your age it's your fault, not POTUS
140 2018-04-02 23:18:29 My boo admitted to me that he stocks me on social media sooooo.......HI 
141 2018-04-02 23:18:03 We should all purge twitter... make them tank. Have a “delete out” and watch their stocks dive since they are drowning our free speech
142 2018-04-02 23:18:02 Stocks typically go up and down
143 2018-04-02 23:18:00 And then dealmaker in chief buys Amazon stocks for cheap to make money with.
What an Asshole!
144 2018-04-02 23:17:41 #QAnon has been so correct, I can't believe more ppl aren't shorting certain stocks. Google might be the Titanic to sink next. Looking at October puts....
145 2018-04-02 23:17:39 @teamtrace: TN Senate will hold a committee hearing Tues on new gun bills: an extreme risk protection order bill, a ban on devices like bump stocks, & a measure to raise the age to purchase assault weapons. NRA opposed. @Emma4Change @davidhogg111
146 2018-04-02 23:17:18 NEW stocks market need to pay with attention If we watch to search BIX quotion.Everybody notices how rough action.
147 2018-04-02 23:17:15 when i'm referring to "the market" i'm always referring to stocks - crypto will always be denoted crypto; that wild west of "investing" has no business using the same terminology rn LOL
148 2018-04-02 23:17:12 Look at my bitch she look like a fox 
Stackin' my money invest it in stocks
149 2018-04-02 23:16:08 No but I also believe the same hedge fund managers who run stocks ie warren buffet etc will clear up in crypto it will bounce up n down it’s algorithm and big banks who own your ass now pretend it’s decentralised 
150 2018-04-02 23:13:39 is there now a black market for bump stocks  ?
151 2018-04-02 23:12:45 #MAGA?  That's right, the MAGA morons don't own stocks and actually use a disproportionate share of social services.  But they applaud when Trump does things to screw my state, California, the sixth largest economy in the WORLD.  Please build the wall - between us and the idiots.
152 2018-04-02 23:12:20 Bump stocks are now banned... Everything takes time...
153 2018-04-02 23:11:50 Data?
Scary weapons don't belong in the streets. They shouldn't be easy to buy, especially to people who can't even drink legally. Comprehensive background checks, ban on bump stocks... there are lots of ideas floating around. Add your own! Participate!

157 2018-04-02 23:08:12 2 There are plenty of reasons why a stock is impacted by seemingly irrelevant trends.  Traders may need to sell shares to cover margin calls (which happens when stocks slide).  They could be irrationally reacting to fear and just selling everything, or just getting redemptions.
158 2018-04-02 23:08:07 You should tune in to Fox Business...

"...will stocks sink lower? Our next guest is a bleach blonde hottie with ENORMOUS breasts... We'll hear from her, right after this break..."

I don't remember what she said about the stocks, but she's my new favorite stock analyst.

160 2018-04-02 23:07:56 The drop in U.S. stocks just shows why you should diversify your portfolio internationally to avoid major losses. However, this is a perfect time to get into stocks due to their low prices! Remember, the U.S. stock market will bounce back so be patient and don’t exit the market
161 2018-04-02 23:07:44 @townhallproject Ga. legislative session just ended - Ga. Rs wouldn't even let a modest bill banning bump stocks out of committee!
162 2018-04-02 23:07:27 lol stockholders threaten to sell stocks. you’re financially threatening a man who literally builds rockets for the hell of it.
163 2018-04-02 23:06:14 Lol you fucking libs are so dumb you still haven't realized that assault weapons don't exist.. only in the minds of clueless politicians who arbitrarily defined them as rifles with pistol grips and adjustable stocks and bayonet lugs.  So people just took off those features
164 2018-04-02 23:06:03 Morocco is heading for an ecological crisis. In a special report it says that 35 percent of Morocco's precious water stocks are lost through bad piping; water is also being polluted by industrial and urban waste.
165 2018-04-02 23:05:40 Market is more than those stocks.
166 2018-04-02 23:04:54 Is there a demonstrable connection? The tech stocks generally were down today.
167 2018-04-02 23:04:30 How do you know that people in the WH shorted Amazon stocks?
168 2018-04-02 23:04:30 Today was a good day until I found out that my stocks were bought out and my account is worth less now : ,)
169 2018-04-02 23:04:27 I only feel like an adult when I check my stocks and see myself losing money.
170 2018-04-02 23:04:16 Let's all help the @realDonaldTrump tank our economy. He's done a remarkable job so far, with a 3000 point loss on the Dow, duties/tariffs/trade wars, tanking US tech stocks by lying and favoring one company over another. Let's all switch to DHL/UPS/FEDEX and see how USPS does.
171 2018-04-02 23:03:59 Over 8 years Obama's policies were antibusiness and we are see some of that now with a lot of new government rules coming online. There was a huge run up in the market and now its correcting itself, pretty normal and a good time to buy stocks
172 2018-04-02 23:03:53 Getting too high? Canadian marijuana stocks skyrocket, raising bubble fears
173 2018-04-02 23:02:59 Invested in my first couple of stocks & I’m feeling good

176 2018-04-02 23:00:53 AR-15s aren’t banned. Nor are large clipazines, bump stocks, and domestic abusers(a group extremely likely to use guns violently) can still purchase guns with the boyfriend loophole.

183 2018-04-02 22:58:08 If I was @BobSMueller, I'd look to see how many shares were bought by anyone related to POTUS, after certain tweeted about stocks fell in price.
184 2018-04-02 22:58:07 Wait for it... good time you will see. Not far from here, rich you can get, when entering at the right time. Stocks only just begun to fall
185 2018-04-02 22:58:01 Rex was right, you’re a f—king moron. USPS knows meaning of COMPETITION for millions in Amazon business, which also goes to other shippers. You hate Amazon cuz they own WaPo (slogan: “Democracy dies in darkness”). We won’t let democracy die. PS Congrats On today’s dive in stocks.
186 2018-04-02 22:57:48 What if he's also making certain stocks lose value and then his companies, his kids companies and his 'friends' buying up that stock, for him to retract his statements so they all make bucket loads of $$.

189 2018-04-02 22:57:09 I would hope one of my stocks would at least hang in there.. Otherwise it's not good at all..
190 2018-04-02 22:56:09 Stocks had their worst second quarter start since the Great Depression, so now we know what the word "Great" is referring to in #MAGA.
191 2018-04-02 22:55:43 He's too busy having Americans lose thousands or more by opening his big fat mouth and making stocks tank.
192 2018-04-02 22:55:04 Bet Trump, family and cronies are “shorting” certain stocks, Amazon for one, to make money. He’s spouting these outrageous lies for a reason. And it’s always about $$. We need someone @washingtonpost or @nytimes to look into this.
193 2018-04-02 22:54:22 @karenfinerman YES!! selling off FANG stocks = huge tax implications- i.e. 250k on $AMZN-  holding thru this sell off. happy for my div. stocks. :)
194 2018-04-02 22:54:12 IF YOU follow stocks they ALWAYS go down before spring break & will go back up next week... FAKE NEWS

196 2018-04-02 22:52:58 A 3,000 point drop in stocks since trump. @realDonaldTrump YOU DID THIS. You are ruining the economy, the environment, education, medical research, trade, just really all of humanity.
197 2018-04-02 22:52:45 Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 1,111 points, or 4.4%, since Congress passed tax cut last December.

Kind of amazing when you think that the tax cut was mainly targeted at corporations; stocks should have gone up even if the economy as a whole didn't.
198 2018-04-02 22:51:44 I'm an amateur of the stock market..but what concerns me of the recent activity is..usually stocks have risen into earnings..and as of April 2, that's not happening..and if it doesn't happen soon, the feeling is whatever's shaking the market, is going to continue to weigh it down
199 2018-04-02 22:51:33 Anthony Tuttle and Kristen Stocks Thompson these two are your minions or at minimum a chip off the old block. Look what they tried all on there own today at breakfast.
200 2018-04-02 22:51:28 Ok maybe I’ll try it. I wish I could get a sample but I don’t live near anywhere that stocks it ffs hahaha
201 2018-04-02 22:51:18 the Street does a horrible job sizing up Washington. Markets understand gridlock in Congress, but a tweeting President is brand new. Some great stocks are getting better priced, but who knows where any of this end when a tweet could send stocks higher, lower, or sideways.
202 2018-04-02 22:51:01 One of my old firms was often the source of "unusual call activity" b/c we'd sell large blocks of calls in stocks we viewed as dead money to collect premium.

We'd hear them highlight the trade on CNBC and wonder what they were trying to sell the avg joe.
203 2018-04-02 22:50:54 #Stocks | If you want an explanation as to why the market is dumping today, you can probably add ‘spec futures selling’ to your laundry list of rationales. @5thrule $DJIA $SPX $NDX $VIX
204 2018-04-02 22:50:03 Shifting the goal posts. If you want to ban rifles, semi automatics or bump stocks then say so. Don't try and ban what's already banned
205 2018-04-02 22:49:50 Stocks always top out on good news. As a so called economist, you should know this, Paul.
206 2018-04-02 22:49:14 Seriously Don! You say you are pro stocks and pro “winners” which Amazon is. They have revolutionized the economy and too many companies sat back and reacted passively...in fact you would have fired those CEO’s. Surprised you aren’t embracing them, this Rep. is very disappointed
207 2018-04-02 22:48:36 Jackie sometimes meditate at salmonella stocks .
208 2018-04-02 22:48:28 Stocks off to worst April start since Great Depression. Thanks Donald!
209 2018-04-02 22:48:23 Stocks are down because big tech is getting rocked for being liberal idiots. Meanwhile, Roseanne is setting major records.

Are you listening Democrats?  That's the sound of your electoral doom you hear approaching.

211 2018-04-02 22:47:55 @karenfinerman as a constant holder if stocks, how do you determine when is the right time to start adding to or completing a refill ofpositions you hold without starting "too early." How do you manage "timing?"
212 2018-04-02 22:47:50 I'm going to buy some Amazon stocks
213 2018-04-02 22:46:45 Not difficult to convert to functionally auto. Bump stocks are still legal.
214 2018-04-02 22:46:43 Problem is most states or School superintendents are doublespeakers of in authenticity.. The Stocks will crash  cause of the Trump lack of economic success, and future public school success depends on HONEST , trusted collaboration/compromise on both sides  for long term success.
215 2018-04-02 22:46:42 Dow dropped 500 today. Do you consider that theft? My husband worked hard for that retirement money. Stocks down 2975 altogether.
216 2018-04-02 22:46:41 They were talking about the 29 charts in 87. Since this, it has copied precisely-rallied to hit the line and falling away. Accelerates from here. Who’s gonna jump in and buy, fangs are still way up. Massive move from stocks to bonds coming with small exits.
217 2018-04-02 22:46:14 FAANG stocks dawg
218 2018-04-02 22:45:49 Crypto and stocks are down, GREAT...... . Can I just hit the lottery or something already?????
219 2018-04-02 22:45:16 Why should regular working Americans who don't own stocks care about the stock market again?  83% of all stocks are owned by 1% of the population, it doesn't effect us and is a misleading rubric of the economy's health. Democratize the economy & the workplace now

221 2018-04-02 22:44:38 Does Obama have blood on his hands cuz the Vegas shooter used bump stocks that Obama decided not to ban? I think a rational person would answer no. So I don’t understand why he goes around making wild statements that ppl like Rubio have blood on their hands lol
222 2018-04-02 22:44:33 Article today in wsj, too many jobs in Midwest, too few people. Economy and markets are separate, but when market falling, think good to notice economy is not. I hoard stocks, not a trader
223 2018-04-02 22:44:25 Stocks plunge as Amazon tumbles. Think this might have something to do with Amazon s refusal back away from NRA. Think what organized real impact this kind of boycott could do to Fox/Murdock or better yet, Sinclair. Guess who loses the most during these adjustments, 1%.
224 2018-04-02 22:44:23 I would like to know also, where do you trade stocks?
225 2018-04-02 22:44:20 The fed I'd buying stocks to shore up trump
226 2018-04-02 22:44:11 Amazon UK stocks some. Or you can make a few trips to London and pick them up...
227 2018-04-02 22:43:51 So why stocks went down today in Shangai, China?
228 2018-04-02 22:43:27 The Big Up and Down volatility in stocks is Institutional Liquidation and rotation at retail investors expense #algorithmictrading #programTrading @CNBCFastMoney
229 2018-04-02 22:43:24 Yeah Trump, if you could stop saying stupid stuff to make my stocks drop, that'd be gr8..
230 2018-04-02 22:42:40 Let’s see, on Nov 8, 2016 the Dow  closed at 18,363. It closed today at 23,644.  For those of us smart enough to ride several of the stocks up when it topped out over 26,000 it was a pretty good deal. Did you give him credit for that?
231 2018-04-02 22:42:34 If Martha Stewart can go to jail for questionable market moves, DJT can certainly go to jail for constantly using the power of the office of the President to tank individual stocks.
232 2018-04-02 22:42:28 But stocks are still at an all time high..
233 2018-04-02 22:42:14 Do something good for the country instead of fucking up my stocks
234 2018-04-02 22:42:01 I bet Trump and Kusher Holdings are shorting stocks.  Nothing would surprise me

245 2018-04-02 22:39:48 I know a Trump voter who got a little bit singed on today's tanking stocks.  But it does sound like he listened to my advice about getting liquid a few weeks ago.  He resisted at first but he was mostly cashed out before today.
246 2018-04-02 22:39:47 He doesn’t invest in stocks or bonds. Just ponzi real estate scams

3. FN on opioid prob, blaming Mex, not big pharma. 
4. Trade war w/China
5. Crushing loss in stocks

252 2018-04-02 22:38:25 When those companies are boycotted and their stocks sold off you can be real proud of your self
253 2018-04-02 22:38:24 The wealthy will benefit - they will but stocks ar much reduced prices
254 2018-04-02 22:38:16 And stocks keep going down. More tariffs, mr. president. China says hi!
255 2018-04-02 22:38:14 And how much you wanna bet Trump's cronies sold Amazon stock with advance knowledge that Trump was going on the warpath.
Just like he did with steel, aluminum and auto stocks when he announced tariffs.
256 2018-04-02 22:37:43 $DSGT Holding this stock for a few months has payed off.. I tend to buy good stocks too soon don't quite know how to fix that other than averaging down which is usually a no no.. avgd down on $LIGA an extra 12k until it finally popped.. but worried it wouldn't.. 
$CLKA BIG winner
257 2018-04-02 22:37:37 #WTF is Trump going to #BASHtweet next? COKE vs PEPSI ? 

THIS HAS TO STOP! IT'S ILLEGAL  what he's doing! Using the power of his office to sway public opinion and CRASH a stock he DOESN'T OWN!  Will my #DISNEY or #COCACola stocks plummet because of his Tweets! #WakeUpAmerica #BS
258 2018-04-02 22:37:29 And how much you wanna bet Trump's cronies sold Amazon stock with advance knowledge that Trump was going on the warpath.
Just like he did with steel, aluminum and auto stocks when he announced tariffs.
259 2018-04-02 22:37:26 This is officially the worst start to the second quarter of the year for stocks since the Great Depression.
260 2018-04-02 22:37:24 U.S. stocks fell sharply on Monday, with the S&P 500 closing below a closely watched gauge of long-term momentum for the first time in about a year and a half, a sign of weakening momentum that could point to further selling ahead.

Maybe.......I must stay humble
261 2018-04-02 22:37:21 A big win for Small Business as "drop" in Tech stocks, yea, (AMAZON) were moving at destroying local business in Everyday Town, U.S.A.
262 2018-04-02 22:37:17 Also interest rates will be rising which will affect stocks.
263 2018-04-02 22:37:12 Why hasn’t @realDonaldTrump said anything about the stocks dropping...if he’s going to take credit for the rise he needs to take credit for its fall. Glad my grandma taught me Great Depression recipes and survival, I’m going to need those skills with potus 45 in office #resign
264 2018-04-02 22:36:55 Breaking: The Stock Market is having its worst second quarter since second quarter since the Great Depression.
US stocks are on track to have their worst April start since 1929.  It’s all your fault! Fuck you and your GOP ! Wake up Trump Supporters ! 
265 2018-04-02 22:36:10 Stocks plummet, public school teachers underfunded, enraged and underpaid. Putin invited to the White House.Controlled state TV with Sinclair Broadcasting, trade wars with China, Private companies targeted by 45 making them lose value. Where does it end? When is it enough?
266 2018-04-02 22:36:08 How them stocks doin?
267 2018-04-02 22:35:52 Don't hear Trump taking credit for stocks dropping. Must be Obama's or Hillary's fault.
268 2018-04-02 22:35:29 Of all the days you post this.. stocks are way down today
269 2018-04-02 22:35:28 Oh BS this is tech stocks going down because people are about to go to jail for collecting data illegaly
270 2018-04-02 22:35:26 ha ha ha Please tell us what happens when an egg is fertilized.  Does it cry?  Does it need a diaper change?  Is it teething or trading stocks???  cells are not babies.
271 2018-04-02 22:35:21 CAN MY STOCKS GO BACK UP. PLEASE.
272 2018-04-02 22:35:16 My stocks fell ~4.5% today. Maybe that fat dinner... should become a skinny dinner. 
273 2018-04-02 22:35:12 As a Vet and someone who grew up hunting I'm fully aware of weapon capabilities and capacities. Yes, clip sizes can be obtained, yet standards that come with weapons vary. Like how you focus on that and not modifications like bump stocks. My 30-06 semi came with a 6 round clip.
274 2018-04-02 22:34:59 Rough day in the markets again today. Remember you don’t lose money until you sell. Good stocks will always make a comeback whether it be weeks or months, stay in for the long run
275 2018-04-02 22:34:57 Donnie...@realDonaldTrump the stocks tanked again today right after you proclaimed that our economy was it's strongest. It could be if you wouldn't shoot yourself in the foot w/ your stupid Tweets! But, you, singlehandedly, will save America...NOT!
276 2018-04-02 22:32:32 Leading the network evening newscasts:
CBS: Stocks plunge for fear of trade war
ABC: Boy rescued after falling in sewer
NBC: Teachers in several states protest funding
277 2018-04-02 22:32:18 Sure.  As we watch our stocks plummet because of your ego.  You suck

279 2018-04-02 22:32:03 My stocks!  Thanks 45. 
280 2018-04-02 22:31:21 Lool either one out of two thing 1. They are high risk investors or 2. They can afford to have millions in stocks. A third possibility could them just dumb
281 2018-04-02 22:31:20 Stocks fall amid rising U.S.-China trade tensions and mounting scrutiny of big tech co. Dow ends 458 pts Nasdaq sheds 193.
282 2018-04-02 22:30:23 He probably told his friends who want to use their tax breaks to buy back stocks. Wait!  I'll get them to come down for you so you can buy them low!  I don't trust #45

284 2018-04-02 22:30:12 It’s sure done more than @SenDeanHeller @TeamDean
@SenDeanHeller couldn’t even muster a call to ban bump stocks after the Las Vegas massacre.
285 2018-04-02 22:30:04 It's "funny" when your stock investments go down and your bond allocation you use to hedge against the stocks also goes down and you also notice gold, the standard stock hedge, goes down as well. Real funny.
286 2018-04-02 22:30:00 I'm safe! 
I can't afford to buy stocks!
287 2018-04-02 22:29:50 Realistically he is at about 73%. Even the never trumpers love the fact they are strong raises bonuses and stocks going up. Hard to deny real facts and visible results.
288 2018-04-02 22:29:09 @DonaldJTrumpJr needs to lead a repeal of #DoddFrank so #MAGA can buy Stocks with the $5.4 Trillion in home equity
289 2018-04-02 22:28:05 John I will admit that I wish he would not have bragged about the market, but only for the jinx factor. I'm 50, want to retire one day, and I am buying stocks. I bet you are too....
290 2018-04-02 22:27:35 Trade Ideas besides all of the stocks, has a Crypto Stocks channel of backtesting scans that are blockchain related. All of the altcoins on the major crypoto exchanges are being coded into the platform as we speak. So this should be coming very soon.
291 2018-04-02 22:27:10 $CPST one of my top stocks for this month . recaptured yearly highs ; definition of a narrow range breakout
292 2018-04-02 22:26:37 Burnout is real, have to know when to take a break and step away for a bit. #stocks #investing
293 2018-04-02 22:26:35 All the bullshit, sure you cant even ban bump stocks over there what purpose do they have for a civilian?? Its insane
294 2018-04-02 22:25:47 @MelissaLeeCNBC this vital market is in a declining trend. One must ether get the hell out of dodge now. Or purchase cheaper stocks threw out the year..
295 2018-04-02 22:25:44 When is the SEC going to deal with the President and his verbal and Twitter statements which cause the market to move predictably? Who's shorting stocks Trump blasts publically?
296 2018-04-02 22:25:41 BREAKING: U.S. stocks are on track to have their worst April start since 1929, according to data compiled by Bloomberg #ExtremeMAGA
297 2018-04-02 22:25:24 Only 50% of American households own stocks - most <$10,000 worth. 84% of stocks are owned by the top 10% wealthiest. So who will be directly impacted by #stockmarketcrash? Rich people. They can afford it. America immorally favors investors with tax laws. We need not cry for them.
298 2018-04-02 22:25:04 That’s y I need to learn the stocks
299 2018-04-02 22:24:56 Great Day at the Office! My 200+ Employees called a meeting and agreed on having a Stock Brokerage Co.Come in this week to MOVE EACH OF THEIR STOCKS Over to GUNS,AMMO,ACCESSORY MFG'S & RELATED! Away from the one's that SUPPORT ANTIGUN 2ND & HOGG'S GROUP FOLLOWERS @davidhogg111
300 2018-04-02 22:24:19 That’s not it . Fang stocks are under pressure and dragging market down . Arguably over bought and in need of pruning . But Trumps public attack on Amazon only exacerbates the problem . Psychology is everything . Strong market reverberates throughout economy . Animal spirits
301 2018-04-02 22:23:57 Wonder if Trump & his buddies are short selling stocks?
302 2018-04-02 22:23:41 for people who trade stocks, what website do you use?
303 2018-04-02 22:23:29 no doubt stocks will be fine, they'll crash the market to buy up more stock creating top wealth for those in the ten to five percent.
304 2018-04-02 22:23:22 How many people with tech stocks lost how much money today thanks to the fakenewsmiester's misinformation, lies, and B.S. about Amazon ? See allb the damage you trump supporters and non voters have so far caused? Where are the trump-supporting evangelicals? ?
305 2018-04-02 22:23:09 His friends are shortibg the stocks! Ca ching!
306 2018-04-02 22:23:07 I own stocks that he hates, but I love Adam’s posts.
307 2018-04-02 22:22:28 @realDonaldTrump   GREAT JOB!!! MAGA JUST LIKE YOUR BUSINESSES! BREAKING: U.S. stocks are on track to have their worst April start since 1929, according to data compiled by Bloomberg
308 2018-04-02 22:21:54 Why is it the minute I get into stocks Trump has to go sticking his dick in it and now I losing money? Lmao
309 2018-04-02 22:21:51 If you missed "All That Thursday Was" over the weekend by Senior Analyst @DarinNewsom, you still have time to read it on #DTN -- USDA's ending stocks estimates look understated...
310 2018-04-02 22:21:27 Hmmm. Let me check my stocks.
311 2018-04-02 22:21:17 Stocks plunge bond yield fall.........1bp. Fab. #nolongerdefensive
312 2018-04-02 22:20:53 netflix stocks crash yaaahhhh. That's what happens when you hire a lying lefty
313 2018-04-02 22:20:31 And there are reasons for pumping stocks or trashing them as well. Yes analysts need to disclose if they hold positions, but there can be so many reasons for their actions(certain ones)that we aren't aware of. Happens every day.
314 2018-04-02 22:20:13 He and @realDonaldTrump love Oil Oligarchs here and abroad.  Hell, they probably even stand behind the Pig Harold Hamm and bid to stop the OK teachers raises.  Oligarchs are running this country.  Call for a sell off of @ContinentalOil stocks and make them poor.
315 2018-04-02 22:19:53 "Tonight on Squawk Box - borrowing: can you ever borrow too much? Remember, if you default, it is not your problem. Also, Jim Cramer talks up various stocks that are sure to collapse by Thanksgiving."
316 2018-04-02 22:19:28 This brings a tear to my eye
317 2018-04-02 22:19:01 Fewer than 1/2 of Americans have an employer sponsored 401k. Only 14% of Americans directly own stocks. Most of Trumps lower income base do not. They believe the economy is better because of Trump.  If the economy gets worse, they will blame liberals and the media.
318 2018-04-02 22:18:36 Spam was sweat with   stocks ??   
319 2018-04-02 22:18:20 Hey buzzword boy speak in details when you are speaking of politics and me . I’m not one of your dumb liberals . I know your whole political lines are just buzzwords with no bases .  Trump is a builder and a buisness man in Stocks
320 2018-04-02 22:17:43 "Great Depression" wasn’t due to a couple of bad months at Wall Street, it was the economy that triggered stocks. We’ve already lost the trade war, it’s time to fight back while the economy is doing well.
321 2018-04-02 22:16:51 Where is my model 3, reserved 2 years ago? Very disappointed. Please concentrate in one business first, Tesla stocks  being downgraded . Sad
322 2018-04-02 22:16:37 $GE bought some @ $12.98
323 2018-04-02 22:15:58 Stocks tumbled Monday after China raised import duties on a number of U.S. exports, bringing the two economic giants closer to a full-on trade conflict. Big technology companies, long investor favorites, suffered heavy losses.
324 2018-04-02 22:15:58 Stocks DID go up significantly before the deluge; maybe somebody has finally realized US stocks are overpriced particularly given the continuing devaluation of the dollar as a result of the Cons’ budgetary games and tax gifts.

local: while you’re here use my robin hood code to sign up and get us some free stocks you get one and i get one let’s get this money together bro  don’t be afraid of the stock market
326 2018-04-02 22:15:12 Remember when Trump pimped stocks like a penny stock promoter at his #StateOfTheUnion address?

Dow Jones (1/30/18): 26,439

DJIA today: 23,644

Decline: 2,795 points

While Trump's Wall Street buddies were banking gains, the #MAGA crowd who trusted Trump lost 11% since #SOTU
327 2018-04-02 22:15:12 If your supposed to buy low and sell high when do you buy low if the marketis always high. It’s the way of the market. People pulling out profits allowing others to purchase temporary low cost stocks. Wow economics 101.
328 2018-04-02 22:14:38 Do feel like a bear market to me !!!-20%of tech stocks already in a BAAR market
329 2018-04-02 22:14:37 Stocks took a hit! That old saying of what's  that got to do with the price of beans in China? We're going too find out, Lol
330 2018-04-02 22:14:10 There is no “may have.” They did. Zuckerberg dumped how many millions in stocks in the past weeks?
331 2018-04-02 22:13:59 An ugly sell-off Monday signals more pain ahead for the market as stocks broke key technical levels.The S&P 500 closed below its 200-day moving average for the first time since June 2016.
332 2018-04-02 22:13:49 What stocks have you purchased lately?
333 2018-04-02 22:13:35 Im okay with it. It was out of control and tech stocks were falsely driving the market. IMHO  I expect it to adjust up again tomorrow.  Economic numbers are good
334 2018-04-02 22:13:03 NEW DAWN FACTION stocks pull-back amid troubling geopolitical headlines
335 2018-04-02 22:12:37 noone needs you in sx, if you are down alot sucks buddy but if stocks were rainbows and candy everyone would be millionaires, now grow a pair and suck it up. noone forced you to push that buy order... you sound like my newborn baby... whiny
336 2018-04-02 22:12:01 “Welcome to Squawk Box, wherewe get 3 guys from the local bar to interview salesmen selling barely underwritten stocks”
337 2018-04-02 22:11:09 Facebook, amazon, netflix, google stocks all took major losses today.. Its a win for conservatives. Maybe they should rethink their bias.
338 2018-04-02 22:10:58 Can't deny lots of people bought stocks for yield the past 9 years.
339 2018-04-02 22:10:09 @GuyAdami Guy, I took your recommendation and bought CY stocks for average $18. If markets go to new lows do I hold or sell then buy them cheaper?
340 2018-04-02 22:10:06 Now with #Amazon stocks tanking maybe that subscription will move to $299.99
341 2018-04-02 22:09:57 Damn it, I didn't phrase the joke properly. Something about peddling pump and dump drug stocks. Nvm. Back to the spreadsheets...
342 2018-04-02 22:09:49 Is it Warren buying up these stocks ?
343 2018-04-02 22:09:37 Stocks are down thanks to your trade war, take credit!

348 2018-04-02 22:08:08 There's a reason full auto fire is referred to as "spray and pray", and why most militaries have moved to short burst fire. Most serious gun owners don't care about bump stocks. They were actually designed for people who have limited use of their trigger fingers.
349 2018-04-02 22:07:59 Mr. POTUS, YOU NEED TO LEARN WHEN TO KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT. YOU SAY SOMETHING ABOUT AMAZON AND THE STOCKS DROP ALL MOST 500 points. THAT HURTS SENIOR CITIZENS WHO USE THE IRA AND 401ks TO LIVE ON. 
WOW YOU KNOW HOW TO HURT SOMEONE BIG TIME.

351 2018-04-02 22:07:52 No one warned about the huge run up post election. Folks like you encouraged selling stocks on 11-8-16.
352 2018-04-02 22:07:37 Has nothing to do with tweets...the Fed is tightening and QT has begun...stocks are ridiculously valued. Gravity wins!
353 2018-04-02 22:07:34 Alarming that Trump's allowed to make untrue statements which affect a business's net worth. It's not like Amazon did anything this past week to impact their business, unlike Sinclair which saw their stocks drop 4.15% today due to their Orwellian scripts. That one was warranted.
354 2018-04-02 22:07:16 Trying to live life on the edge so I'm going to load $EDGE if under $1 tomorrow
355 2018-04-02 22:07:04 And no car bump stocks!
356 2018-04-02 22:06:43 I don’t care how well you trade stocks but if you can’t spell in your tweets then you will not survive in the real world.
357 2018-04-02 22:06:04 Yes, but what damage will he do in the mean time?  Healthcare destroyed, stocks in shambles, no immigration solution, foreign policy turmoil, etc etc.
358 2018-04-02 22:06:01 He’s avg 4 stocks a game per 36minutes and is noticeably the best defender in the draft, I can say that
359 2018-04-02 22:05:45 I just threw up a little ... #Bloomberg just headlined "worst start since 1929" #stocks
360 2018-04-02 22:05:43 Put half into a safe investment that'll grow at a steady rate. Put the rest into stocks that can grow faster. A portion into blue chips and then some onto more risky investments that have high potential.
361 2018-04-02 22:04:56 It wouldn’t surprise me if this was pre-planned by Trump. Knowing China would retaliate, causing market to drop & Trump could have informed his buddies to “short” their stocks today. Purely criminal
362 2018-04-02 22:04:48 I think there was some discussion on that last year; buying stocks on the cheap after a tantrum
363 2018-04-02 22:04:02 US NY MARKETS - NEW SOUNDBITE
Tech woes, trade tensions sink US stocks. STORY #4147170
364 2018-04-02 22:03:23 Trump is BAD for business. (See stocks today -- new trade war/tariffs, Amazon-bashing, etc.)

Trump is BAD for everyone other than cishet, conservative white males. (See almost anything he's ever said about people who aren't just like him.)

Trump is BAD for America.
365 2018-04-02 22:03:22 Breaking. It’s no surprise but @realDonaldTrump is a danger to every person in the world. He’s manipulating stock markets for financial gain.  No doubt he’s in buying after causing US stocks to crash #cnn #foxnews #auspol
366 2018-04-02 22:02:17 RT CRAZYMERiCANS: business He won't care (Trump), they won't care (Trumpamzees), so I don't care (don't have any stocks and my 401k is not even a nest egg anymore). 
367 2018-04-02 22:01:54 The mkt decline was due to fear of inflation and tech stocks taking a shit. But keep getting ur market updates from movies hope that works out for u
368 2018-04-02 22:01:35 To me what's important is the change in sentiment in stocks that has ocurred after the precious Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December, the GOP/Trump crown jewel of achievement. Seems like "Sell in May and Go Away" came early this year.
369 2018-04-02 22:01:25 I had sold 3/4 of my stocks and put that money into savings just prior to Trump taking office. I figured it was just a matter of time before it would start collapsing under Trump. I figure it will get worse. "In Trump I do not trust." :-)
370 2018-04-02 22:01:04 No, the well prepared survivalist stocks quinine to make tonic water.
371 2018-04-02 22:01:01 Every word the business news networks say is carefully designed to sell junk to idiots. They preach the ease of making a fortune and promote stocks based solely on rumors. Their analysis is one-sided and add nothing to the discussion. Need anything else?
372 2018-04-02 22:00:43 Associated Press: Tech woes, worsening tensions with China sink US stocks
373 2018-04-02 22:00:33 Gas is up over $.55 a gallon, National Grid is raising my bill by 11%, milk is up $.75 a gallon. My 401k is taking another disastrous hit. Wages are NOT going up, corporations are buying back their stocks. Who's benefitting?
374 2018-04-02 22:00:03 Stocks cyberplunge as cybertrade, cybertech worries drag prices down; Dow drops more than 450 cyberpoints
375 2018-04-02 21:59:59 So why take down #Amazon? Maybe to pretend the downturn in stocks is not related to #ChinaTradeWar?
376 2018-04-02 21:59:53 And I don't think they've divvy up those Q stocks but he just need to go somewhere and have a seat and do like every other man do build his own stuff from the ground up and stop looking for handouts
377 2018-04-02 21:59:44 America’s trailer trash white underclass don’t invest in stocks! Ain’t gonna affect Trump’s base.
378 2018-04-02 21:59:09 I know jim. I hold 3 nasdaq stocks but i’d buy them again so i’m holding
379 2018-04-02 21:58:45 Can you please tell m why the WSJ article in Google results is titled "Stock Markets Rise Despite China Trade Retaliation," but the article actually details that "Stocks Tumble on Tech Selloff?" Am I missing something?

382 2018-04-02 21:57:41 There are definitely people close to him getting him riled up on one hand and shorting stocks on the other.
383 2018-04-02 21:57:13 That a boy! Making America great again! Stocks down, store closings, jobs lost and we gotta blame somebody, so why not blame Amazon! After all, they made him loose money too!
384 2018-04-02 21:56:21 The political myth in stocks goes like this: a down market during October prior to election predicts challenging pol party will win. Something to think about as we near midterms, its the uncertainty that investors dont like.
385 2018-04-02 21:56:05 @RealDonad_Trump  Ever heard of the Midas touch?  You're the opposite. Everything you touch turns to Shit. #DonaldTrump #DThastheshittouch #KingShit #stocks #yousuck
386 2018-04-02 21:55:54 Yep!! One of my stocks lost more than $10/share. It was at a 52W high when he took office....
387 2018-04-02 21:55:43 Donald Trump

a man unhinged
so they say

Stocks up and Down
advance notice over a meal
Trumps tips them off
The art of the deal

making billions of dollars
off inside trading
Trumps corruption is real
Investors confidence is fading
388 2018-04-02 21:55:25 Stock market drop today due to money managers selling stocks that performed great in Q1 to make their performance look better. I'm concerned about the trend recently not today by itself.
389 2018-04-02 21:54:46 when you cook your veg keep the bits left over and freeze them in ziplocks. this is how you build your stocks.
390 2018-04-02 21:54:29 There’s an investigation into the guy who sold his aluminum or steel stocks just before Trump’s Tariffs announcement! INSIDER TRADING!
391 2018-04-02 21:54:22 If I take my money out of 401k stocks with vanguard and move it all into the gold bullion, coins, silver etc. Do I pay capital gains?
392 2018-04-02 21:54:11 This president is working hard to destroy our economy, why would the supposed leader of our country criticize American companies.  Could it be that his rich friends will be buying depressed stocks and make even more profits?
393 2018-04-02 21:53:56 No lol let’s go over these stocks on stash and plan to get rich
394 2018-04-02 21:53:51 Deep Dive: Intel, Amazon and Tesla lead tech stocks lower on the first trading day of April
395 2018-04-02 21:53:20 Another thing you might want to check is just how Trump manipulates stocks for the benefit of friends and family. His billionaire buddies prime the well during his midnight phone binges, and the next day he tunes into Faux and Friends for guidance. Millions change hands.
396 2018-04-02 21:53:06 S&P 500 firms have bought back almost $4 trillion of their own shares since the U.S bull market began nine years ago. That's almost as much as the Fed expanded it's balance sheet. #markets #stocks #bonds #Investing
397 2018-04-02 21:53:02 Be careful using your double jump to pull a bomb

I often find myself taking stocks when they do that
398 2018-04-02 21:52:20 If Q1 earnings and 2018 guidance updates are solid I don't see how stocks continue to decline. Economic fundamentals are strong and risk of some trade war dislocation is priced in IMHO.
399 2018-04-02 21:52:18 Get it straight, Jake. Stop manipulating the news to make @realDonaldTrump  look bad.  Stocks tumbled today due a fall in tech stocks across the board.
400 2018-04-02 21:51:42 It is her. I don’t remember the exact quote but she said something about banning bump stocks then went into the “give us an inch, we’ll take a mile”.
401 2018-04-02 21:51:33 @MelissaLeeCNBC   same show that hadpeople on pumping all the Fang stocks like a month ago and back in November and December and January you Criminal
402 2018-04-02 21:51:15 Call buying activity is usually/often means stocks is ready to take another leg down.
403 2018-04-02 21:51:03 I don’t think any statement that starts “stocks should” will end well... that said, the rate drops were already priced in...
404 2018-04-02 21:50:38 Just as dumb as banning bump stocks, assault rifles, or banning 30rd mags. All non sense feel good garbage because they don't want to tell the truth - we can't make you safe. If bad people want to hurt you, they can't be stopped. So we pretend to do something to pacify the crowd.
405 2018-04-02 21:50:28 DowJones falls 3% plus on the back of tweets and an initiated trade war. Those with the $$$ lump in on the stocks and in a month they've made serious money.

406 2018-04-02 21:50:00 Last week's 2.9% rally was the biggest weekly gain seen in FTSE Futures in the 68 weeks since 9 Dec 2016. FTSE has posted a net weekly change (in either direction) of at least 2.9% for 2 weeks in a row. This sequence last extended to 3 weeks on 2 Dec 2011, 331 weeks ago #stocks
407 2018-04-02 21:48:57 Plus there's that  vindictive burn-thy-enemies-to-the-ground mentality. 
Serious Q: Who'd be surprised if, last week, Trump's family & friends started taking out positions to short Amazon stocks? The desire for get-quick money to bolster Kushner/Trump debts could be driving this.
408 2018-04-02 21:48:38 Oh no doubt that's coming.  This is actually a pretty disturbing fact, considering the tax cut passed should have boosted stock prices, being that corporations so largely benefited from the cut.  If stocks aren't doing well, what benefit was gained?
409 2018-04-02 21:48:33 3.83% of corporate tax cuts going to stock buybacks, exec bonuses& dividends. Meanwhile 80% of stocks are owned by just 20% of Americans.IOW: Top 20% getting benefits
4.Just 12% of Corpor TXS cuts are going toLABOR
That's MINISCULE.Would be better to RAISE MIN WAGE
But GOP won't.
410 2018-04-02 21:46:34 Y esa entrada en Facebook?
411 2018-04-02 21:46:27 I’ve been buying stocks after the fall. I do not expect a full bear market there… yet.
412 2018-04-02 21:46:25 I really don't understand it. The woman I knew for 40 years voted for Obama twice. I can't understand why she became a Trump follower. Maybe money is all I can think of. Stocks. She is well off.
413 2018-04-02 21:45:56 Yes but the stocks are overestimated, they will crash soon or later...
The trade war with China will just accelerate it.
414 2018-04-02 21:45:54 Do you think it is OK to sell guns to convicted felons and mentally disturbed people?  Do you think gun owners should be allowed to have bump stocks?  What about gun shows?  Is it Ok to acquire a gun without any background check? These are common sense concerns are they not?
415 2018-04-02 21:44:26 One of my fave stocks. Great things ahead 
416 2018-04-02 21:44:19 Stage is set for $ , rates to rally. Stocks under a bus
417 2018-04-02 21:42:19 Anyone tracking which stocks Trump and friends have been short selling lately?
418 2018-04-02 21:41:42 There is something calld market cycles and its the same with all kinds of stocks you can see it very clearly in crypto which moves a looot faster than stocks because the re is so low money compared to stocks hence the volatility and the dia and stocks will follow what happend btc
419 2018-04-02 21:41:40 Won't buy any of these stocks!
420 2018-04-02 21:41:38 Not true at all. The NRA is protecting 2A. It’s their charter. Guns are not the issue. Sick people with guns are. The administration has proposed eliminating bump stocks and strengthening back ground checks. Good first steps but Congress passes laws not the President
421 2018-04-02 21:40:59 Trump: “It’s amazing the way stock market loves my tax cuts. Stocks are way, way up!!”

I could literally see this very quote/tweet today and not be the slightest bit surprised.
422 2018-04-02 21:40:44 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
423 2018-04-02 21:40:41 Trump, stop fucking over my stocks, you cunt.
424 2018-04-02 21:40:33 Have you checked your stocks today?? 401k?
425 2018-04-02 21:40:27 So you think we've entered a bear market for stocks?   If so, I'm inclined to agree.  I expect those double-bottoms will not last long.
426 2018-04-02 21:40:17 Some stocks that are very attractive at current prices to me are: 
$COHR $285

$BABA $177

$AAOI $24.50

427 2018-04-02 21:39:47 So, don't you wonder whether Trump donors/supporters are profiting from these wild swings? They discuss him sending out these tweets, sell short, he tweets, stocks crash, they clean up.....sell before it crashes, sell short to benefit when it does.

433 2018-04-02 21:36:20 Also just don't try and land anywhere near him ever if you are at kill percent as if he does a random up smash you will die, and bear in mind that he is very light so a good upsmash read of your own ends his stocks very early too

436 2018-04-02 21:35:06 @thefive with ban of possession of bump stocks, why doesn't state or fed have to reimburse the owner for having bought something legally? @JesseBWatters @greggutfeld
437 2018-04-02 21:34:30 1/ Investing is a race with no finish lines. Those who don't realize this are more likely to sell winning stocks too quickly (to reach an artificial finish line), hold too much in cash (to rest on their occasional short-term laurels), and eventually underperform the market over
438 2018-04-02 21:34:10 Jobs Report April 6th:  Trump/GOP may report a rosy (but untrue?) March job report Friday to prop up stock market.   If market rallies early, it may be a good time to cut back on your exposure to stocks.  Remember you can cut back on stock holdings in your 401K

444 2018-04-02 21:34:00 And nearly all of this decline in #stocks is caused by Trump shooting from the hip like an idiot, and his complete lack of coherent economic and political policy. Maybe the @HouseGOP and @SenateGOP will do something to stop him now that he's destroying their net worth?
445 2018-04-02 21:33:56 My stocks are way down today. Is that what your applauding?
446 2018-04-02 21:33:41 A correction occurs when an overall inflationary market undergoes a “correction” after sober valuations of overpriced stocks and a new trend is established. Not wild swings based on presidential impulse threats of trade wars or dragging Amazon because you are jealous of success.
447 2018-04-02 21:33:15 Unless those others wanted to ban assault weapons or bump stocks or armour piercing bullets or magazines with over 10 bullets. You have no intention of protecting their right to live if it infringes on your right to own people killing assault rifles. #NRAIsATerroristOrganization
448 2018-04-02 21:33:02 Worth remembering that the stock market mostly viewed Trump as a negative in 2016—stocks tended to decline as Trump's polling vs. Hillary improved. Then there was initially a huge sell-off in overnight futures when Trump won on 11/8, which abruptly reversed itself the next day.

452 2018-04-02 21:32:27 I notice you are no longer talking about stocks. It’s amazing how before your economic policies took effect you were happy to take credit. Strange that you aren’t taking credit now that your policies are actually in effect and actually likely are a factor.

456 2018-04-02 21:31:38 Wow,the Dow just zoomed past a key support level,a triple bottom,at 23,750. I can't hear what stocks are saying :) but I'm guessing tomorrow will be even more brutal,for stocks.For sure,if the Dow rises to approximately 23,750,it will surely go back down again...not looking good.
457 2018-04-02 21:29:38 I don't want home ownership now. Bc we move too much. I'll eventually own a home. We have some high risk and low risk investment in stocks/401k and don't touch it. That's how we're planning to build wealth for now.

512 2018-04-02 21:12:57 @Wayfair stocks, -7.21% dropped 6.5% in afternoon trade toward a 4 1/2-month low, after famed short seller Citron Research issued a report saying the online home furnishings retailer was "growing enemies faster than customers."
513 2018-04-02 21:12:54 Besides pure vindictiveness and blatant sabotage
I smell big rats...
I’ve got money on the next big reveal: @DonaldJTrumpJr @EricTrump @IvankaTrump @jaredkushner @SecretaryRoss @stevenmnuchin1 etc are trading/profiting from the stocks @POTUS manipulates.

516 2018-04-02 21:10:52 Have a quick look at your own portfolio.  How many of them have YOU done any RESEARCH on? How many have you bought into blindly because someone else said it was a done deal? This tax year make a deal with yourself to only put money in stocks which aside from RNS you can back up.
517 2018-04-02 21:10:32 The only bullish fundamentalist I follow thinks interest rates will continue rising, causing money managers to sell their bonds and buy stocks.  Is  that why others are bullish?

521 2018-04-02 21:07:31 We had a 20% decline for stocks in both 1994 and 1998. Technically, bear markets. No recession for earnings or the economy accompanied either. Those are just two examples.

527 2018-04-02 21:06:12 @jaketapper Amazon is still one of the most overpriced stocks on Wall Street and since the market is falling anyway, I doubt that Trump is totally to blame
528 2018-04-02 21:06:09 US Stocks (2nd quarter) off to worst start since 1929!
MAGA crowd will say that’s making America GREAT because 1929 was also GREAT...the GREAT DEPRESSION! Idiots!

529 2018-04-02 21:06:09 LMFAO, what patents do they have, what new technologies do they hold that they believe they can out do a specialist manufacturer? Stocks should have fallen for Apple, surely they will fail or be third best in the best case scenario.
530 2018-04-02 21:06:09 #stocks above 50/150/200 well above the lows set on 2/9 so prices falling and making new lows but break-downs not confirming prices, at least yet

Turned to sad news.
No work so far
Pull yo stocks.
532 2018-04-02 21:05:26 I’m a bit surprised only stocks moving - would like to see credit and FX affected to believe it.
533 2018-04-02 21:05:25 Stocks Plunged 460 Points As China Retaliates Over U.S. Tariffs. Now Mr. Trump Will Deny This Fact As "Fake News" Anytime There's An Controversial Issue With Trump He Blames The Media? Russian Collusion, DACA Failures & The Stormy Daniels Sex Scandal Is All Fake News, Right?
534 2018-04-02 21:05:19 Notice my prediction about the financial stocks made a year ago was ACCURATE.Warned u.

538 2018-04-02 21:04:29 @realDonaldTrump Why should people buy stocks when you are anti free enterprise and anti success?  I'm out - because this is not my America.

I think crypto is the global liquidity end game and both stocks it have ways to fall.
564 2018-04-02 21:00:30 Well the stock market is starting to look like the crypto market. 

On a bright note, now we can ask all our nocoiner friends, "How your stocks holding up? Looking a little like the crypto market these days!"
565 2018-04-02 21:00:19 What about the wealth effect when the major stock markets dive? If you start feeling poorer, you consume less and so on. #economy #stocks
566 2018-04-02 20:59:58 This whole thing where Trump rips a company and their stocks fall is garbage and his personal, politically motivated callouts of businesses are one of the many things he is doing that are making America a less desireable place to do business.

570 2018-04-02 20:57:57 It's funny though because average Americans don't care about how stocks are doing. We care about wages. If this gets more Americans jobs, no matter how bad, then wages will go up, slowly, and the average American benefits. Stock market is a bad analogy for overall economy.
571 2018-04-02 20:57:39 #realDonaldTrump  Thanks for screwing with millions of investors in stocks in the US.  Your "facts" on Amazon are not accurate you attack success.
572 2018-04-02 20:57:38 I wanted to find a spot for Kushida so bad. Couldn’t figure out where it would fit, and the card was already huge. Plus, Marty and Hangman’s stocks have elevated due to the whole BC turmoil. Wanted to book Goto, too.
573 2018-04-02 20:57:15 This is pure vindictiveness and blatant sabotage by @realDonaldTrump - and I smell rats...
Someone investigate if @DonaldJTrumpJr @EricTrump @IvankaTrump @jaredkushner @SecretaryRoss etc are trading/profiting from the stocks @POTUS manipulates.
574 2018-04-02 20:56:55 Seriously wondering if one of Trump’s kids shorted #Amazon or something. Presidents shouldn’t go around tanking stocks, especially ones that so many Americans have in their 401(k)
575 2018-04-02 20:56:51 $SPOT IPO in this market. Poor timing? #Stocks #Investing
576 2018-04-02 20:56:42 Further steep falls for tech stocks — including Amazon, Tesla and Intel — saw the Nasdaq Composite briefly down more than 10 per cent from its March record high, Consumer cyclicals and non-cyclicals were worst off, down 2.8 per cent and 2.5 per cent,  FT

581 2018-04-02 20:55:01 He worked for a bank in London ?
Which one ?
What payements did he oversee ? ;)
Perhaps witnessed some trading of stocks with inside knowledge too ?

In other words: What crimes could be related with his profession and the links to team Trump ?
582 2018-04-02 20:54:36 Booming economy gift from Obama is rapidly being destroyed ...... Trade wars and tarriffs Donald tore down in 14 months what it took Obama and democrats 7 years to build up.............stocks down 600 and trump approval back in the 30s
583 2018-04-02 20:54:19 Mortgage Bonds begin the second quarter of 2018 slightly lower while Stocks are also lower. Floating is recommended.

585 2018-04-02 20:54:08 Stocks suffer a bad first quarter of 2018. Manufacturing activity in the U.S. remains solid. Fourth quarter 2017 homeownership rte inches hi
586 2018-04-02 20:54:04 Seems like some people who own stocks actually believe stuff Trump says and does and act accordingly.  This mess can  all be avoided if people acknowledge his clownness and ignore him from now on.
587 2018-04-02 20:54:03 Who's ready for a market correction? Buyers get ready! #YVR #stocks #investing
588 2018-04-02 20:53:54 Market Wrap-up: stocks fall amid China tariff concerns as tech leads declines. SCHW recovered from early lows and now looking to confirm support. AXL also declined  filling both bids. See Traders Pick Current and Open Status for updates.
589 2018-04-02 20:53:39 So when the market is up, you down play by saying big deal, most people don’t own stocks.  Then the market falls, & you go into alarmist mode.  Look at all the old people losing their retirement savings!  Talk about erratic thinking.  Make up your mind.

595 2018-04-02 20:51:45 The way this #POTUS impacts the #stockmarket and especially his personal attacks via Twitter on individual stocks seems rather dubious and unethical. He’s impugning some that a little guy like me invest in to build some semblance of wealth
596 2018-04-02 20:51:45 Just pain for the indexers. Would like to see a good 20% correction. Then maybe the retail masses won’t think stocks are so easy.
597 2018-04-02 20:51:40 Keep your eyes on who benefits from the stocks going down.

601 2018-04-02 20:51:06 Yeah when President Obama said some about the stock market the press was all over him! Trump has stocks on a roller coaster and there’s nothing but crickets !
602 2018-04-02 20:51:01 @ikem9jeria where do you see junior mining stocks on TSX Venture going in 2018?
603 2018-04-02 20:50:55 @SEC_News Are you going to investigate Trump and his attempts to manipulate Amazon stocks?  This needs to be looked into.
604 2018-04-02 20:50:29 Poor Teddy, not getting the reaction he was hoping to get. Still not enough in sales of his old 8track tapes to buy his underage girls, chewing tobacco and bump stocks. So sad. Boohooohooo.
605 2018-04-02 20:50:27 Yes, and humiliated. That Press conference was the modern day equivalent of the stocks...
606 2018-04-02 20:50:00  @realDonaldTrump, do you have anything to say about causing stocks to tank today? Your counter-productive tariffs and asinine tweets do not #MAGA. This is the worst start to second quarter market since the Great Depression.
607 2018-04-02 20:49:37 Not okay....not okay....this orange piece of trash knows what he says will affect the stock market. What's the end goal?....revenge or did he short any stocks?
608 2018-04-02 20:47:59 I’m sure Sinclair’s deal with Tribune will go through. Fox Channel is Trump’s favorite and the leading channel in spreading propaganda. Has anyone checked to see if Trump’s comp own stocks in Sinclair Broadcasting or if Trump’s comp have any Fox’s staff on the comp payroll?
609 2018-04-02 20:47:50 Serious question: Is Donald involved in shorting Amazon stocks? Is this all just some financial chicanery to help out some friends/family aiming to make quick money at the expense of Amazon?
610 2018-04-02 20:47:35 Could somebody please try to do something about #bots #trading #stocks based on #AprilFools ?
611 2018-04-02 20:47:11 If you didn't buy stocks today. Buy tomorrow.  Average down or up over the week.  This is a nice little spring discount
612 2018-04-02 20:46:57 #Stocks | It's a situation where the proven winners for the past few years are faltering. When that happens, there is a negative psychological sense in the market. @marcchaikin $DJIA $SPX $NDX $VIX - $AMZN $TSLA $FB etc.
613 2018-04-02 20:46:35 Deleted all my stocks and trading apps. No good was becoming of it. Ill check them again next month ;).

620 2018-04-02 20:44:55 Converted my 401K from stocks to cash and a few bonds. There will be some wild ups in the market but I truly believe tRump ends his presidency with market below 20,000. Maybe even 15,000. He destroys EVERYTHING he touches
621 2018-04-02 20:44:40 I had to sell all my stocks today. I didn’t want to risk it 
622 2018-04-02 20:44:12 I wonder how stock holding voters feel about the fact that the stock market has suddenly become completely volatile based on economic decision by Navarro - an economist who has literally no one in his profession on his side. 

But don't worry about those stocks, we'll fix it all.
623 2018-04-02 20:44:10 Rewording of some @POTUS tweets from earlier this year:

'Business enthusiasm waning over concerns about Trump trade war and attacks on U.S. companies.  Stocks dropped rapidly today. That doesn't just happen!'
624 2018-04-02 20:44:01 All these overpriced tech stocks bringing down the market
625 2018-04-02 20:43:59 Promoting Sinclair! Hummmmm, bought stocks?
626 2018-04-02 20:43:38 What would the effect on world ending stocks be if the western Ks and Okie panhandle crop was zeroed out?  I once heard that loss of the 2018 hrw crop would only make a 68 million bushels dent in a 1 billion bushel world carryout.
627 2018-04-02 20:43:17 I don't own stocks, but trade currencies, everything was going all good in my CAD/CHF pair until some orange blabber mouth said something about NAFTA.
628 2018-04-02 20:42:35 Yes the other stores may indeed have different stocks - do let us know how you get on 
629 2018-04-02 20:41:51 Brutal day on markets: Tech stocks and Facebook, China and US Tariffs,  not to mention the Presidential attack on one of your own companies (Amazon)... Ugh... Before people get their panties in a knot...my portfolio felt the  pain today...
630 2018-04-02 20:41:34 Not me... Taxes falling, wages rising, 3 quarters 3+% GDP growth (44 avgd 1.8%), unemployment lowest since Nixon, Black & Hispanic unemployment lowest ever, stocks rising, ISIS lost all land, 22 regulations trashed for every 1 created, NK denuclearizing, trade deals renegotiated
631 2018-04-02 20:41:13 Did it ever x your minds that Trump berates Amazon, stocked go down, big buy by buddy's, Trump says "Never Mind" stocks back up. Presidential manipulation!
632 2018-04-02 20:40:51 When do you think MJ stocks will bounce back? I'm debating on selling now and accumulate after bear trend ends
633 2018-04-02 20:40:29 @realDonaldTrump @potus Hey, hey, wadda u say? How many stocks did u kill today?
634 2018-04-02 20:40:09 Taxes falling, wages rising, 3 quarters 3+% GDP growth (44 avgd 1.8%), unemployment lowest since Nixon, Black & Hispanic unemployment lowest ever, stocks rising, ISIS lost all land, 22 regulations trashed for every 1 created, NK denuclearizing, trade deals renegotiated #MAGA
635 2018-04-02 20:39:39 Wonder how many of his “swamp friends” are shorting certain stocks? While regular people that voted for him LOSE $$ in their retirement funds. #VotedAgainstTheirOwnInterests
636 2018-04-02 20:39:33 Oh brother here goes the fear mongering fake news media STOCKS CANNOT KEEP GOING UP THEY ARE MADE TO GO UP AND DOWN it's a normal cycle otherwise EVERYONE WOULD BE IN THE GAME idiots @CNBC
637 2018-04-02 20:39:10 weakness in tech stocks? You mean you jack offs got more stench & filth than expected from the Cavuto dirty diapers you wear like a hat? Or was that Trish Reagans panties?
638 2018-04-02 20:39:08 I'm still pissed off that Zuckerburger sold his own FB stock knowing bad press was coming. Talk about treating your stockholders like shit.

A reporter will dig hard enough, and find numerous connections to stock selling, dire public pronouncements and then stocks falling.
639 2018-04-02 20:39:08 When interests rates are low #stocks will grow, when interests rates are high stocks will die. #StockMarket

Q
642 2018-04-02 20:38:21 My stocks keep going down 
643 2018-04-02 20:37:32 So far not seeing any big wins. But with China enforcing their own tariffs & Trump attacking Amazon; stocks are tanking. Which means we’re seeing big losses.
644 2018-04-02 20:37:19 I can't say I'm a fan either but I've got "tech stocks" that are fanned out and some of them are in amazon. I don't really get a say as to where my holdings are so I've taken a hit. I'm pissed.
645 2018-04-02 20:37:07 @DakotaStyle How do we get @Walmart to stock your Sunflower Kernels again. Enjoyed your Great #AllNatural product buy the Local Virginia #Walmart stopped carrying them.

647 2018-04-02 20:36:32 I can't find a reference anywhere that says stocks are down due to big tech being liberal idiots. I only see references to trade wars and tariffs on US goods.
648 2018-04-02 20:35:22 The problem with @POTUS tweets like this one is the damage to IRAs and other retirement consumer investments. It also creates the opportunity to those Trump "Tweet" insiders to short these stocks the president attacks ahead of the tweet. Fodder for Mr Mueller.

651 2018-04-02 20:34:39 It's January 26, Dow is above 26,600, you just cracked a cold one with the boys and thought, "Wow I really thought Trump was going to be terrible, but look at stocks. We hasn't said anything that would completely make us lose all these gains for no reason." Life was good
652 2018-04-02 20:34:10 @realDonaldTrump hey fuck face yeah you that thinks he is president my fucking stocks are taking a dump you
#shit4brains asswipe. No tax benefits either fuck wad
653 2018-04-02 20:34:05 @realDonaldTrump is playing with fire with @Amazon. They should have a strong defamation case against him as a result of his recent tweets. I expect @JeffBezos and all shareholders will be consulting their legal teams #Amazon #Business #Legal #Trump #USA #Stocks #StocksMarket
654 2018-04-02 20:33:55 @Cnbc should allocate more time discussing $gld stocks and less time discussing tech stocks

656 2018-04-02 20:33:07 The top five stocks that fell today were $NKTR, $ALM, $CXO, $TSN, and $INTC.

661 2018-04-02 20:31:37 Stocks plummet as tech, Amazon lead broad selloff; Nasdaq negative for 2018
662 2018-04-02 20:31:01 Tech stocks down because their are liberal idiots?  Man, you work for Bloomberg or the WSJ with that kind of in depth analysis?
663 2018-04-02 20:30:19 I find it interesting on days like this few want to create a shopping list for the resilient names.  I actually had a couple of stocks positive today and a couple near flat.
664 2018-04-02 20:29:57 @realDonaldTrump my husband and I not only voted for you but stand beside you during your presidency. But you have got to stop destroying our stocks especially in Amazon this is our retirement please
665 2018-04-02 20:29:56 It was another chaotic day as U.S. stocks tumbled, led by a rout in technology shares. @Tesla was weighed down by Model 3 worries. @amazon was berated by President Trump again. And economists are warning the world is on the verge of an all-out trade war. - Sounds about right.
666 2018-04-02 20:29:48 Sorry I just noticed stocks were mispelled. I don't know if it was me or spell check. I'm messaging and answering tweets. But with China's retaliation of billions in array of things including fruits & vegtables. Some have STALKS.
667 2018-04-02 20:29:42 Stock mkt is officially a loser in 2018: Every major index now in the red YTD. Blue chips worse than smaller stocks, Nasdaq still better than most:

NYSE avg  -4.6%
Dow   -4.4
S&P 500  -3.4
S&P midcap   -3.4
Russell 2000   -2.8
Nasdaq  -0.5
Nasdaq 100  -0.1
668 2018-04-02 20:29:29 Trump you single handily destroy companies economy stocks 401k- no re-elections for you- we won’t forget
669 2018-04-02 20:29:18 @Tesco hello, can you tell me which of your East London stores stocks @Fruli Beer? Found it in your Streatham store, but need it more local?
670 2018-04-02 20:29:06 It seems that there is some legal liability there (or there should be) for the asshat in chief recklessly tanking Amazon stocks on purpose. But then again there are  a number of things he does almost daily that seem illegal to the layperson like me.
671 2018-04-02 20:28:16 Everyone raised cash but if the market holds the 200 day, it's going up. They sold but earnings season will boost stocks,  unless it doesn't.
672 2018-04-02 20:27:56 There were 0 Canadian cannabis stocks that tanked today the small increments they came down only made them a bargain hunters Paradise.
673 2018-04-02 20:27:29 Stocks post worst start to April since the Great Depression! Thanks #Spanky #SpankyThePresident @realDonaldTrump #Imbecile
674 2018-04-02 20:27:17 Trump tweets have tanked stocks often enough to be predictable. I hope Mueller and the SEC are watching for insider trades.
675 2018-04-02 20:27:03 Canada ($EWC) is trading where it did in 2006 é 2007.  It is not expensive.  Many, many stocks are in that category.
676 2018-04-02 20:27:00 Ya when is money from all these foolish stocks gonna hit crypto where they can really make some money
677 2018-04-02 20:26:45 Looks like my prediction warning investors they might one unload some text stocks looks like it can true..judging by todays business news..we’ll have to see what happens from here....
678 2018-04-02 20:26:33 Stocks up = Trump. Stocks down = dems.  You're consistent, at least.
679 2018-04-02 20:26:18 Tech Stocks Down Today Thats Right , I Sold All My Tech's And Bought More $VEC Gold  @JBrewerMining Back In The DRC This Week ! Triple Due Diligence And Millions Of Ounces Of Gold Just Waiting For Signatures.
680 2018-04-02 20:25:39 $TSLA $NVDA etc., Message to #CNBC #Bloomberg #FoxBusiness Any idiot can come up with a reason why a particular stock is falling when all #stocks crack up. The #ElonMusk #AprilFools story is nonsense. The #Nvidia #blockchain story is BS. Its the market stupid! PS: Lose O'Leary!
681 2018-04-02 20:25:34 Wouldn't it be hilarious if Jeff Bezos started buying up all of Sinclair's stocks? It's valuation is around $4B now. A drop in the bucket for Jeff.
682 2018-04-02 20:25:29 @XxMUDDxX all stocks are in trouble to varying degrees.   Don’t be a cheerleader.  It won’t help.
683 2018-04-02 20:25:16 how those Sinclair stocks though.
684 2018-04-02 20:24:48 How many stocks will the Trump family be buying up while Trump is tanking the market? Asking for a friend...
685 2018-04-02 20:24:39 It dropped 458 points and due to tech stocks dropping. Which has been the case the last couple of weeks. I do agree the tariff war needs to be addressed and adjusted that someone else has been posting about.
686 2018-04-02 20:24:29 Time to eat again, and relax ... I'm thinking tonight's reading selection will include a little James Allen ...

690 2018-04-02 20:23:32 Everyone do your part and order from @amazon more than usual this week, this month.
Because of wackadoodle tyrant Trump's own personal beef with Jeff Bezos who's business unit owns @washingtonpost -- he's determined to sink stocks and knee our economy in the balls.
691 2018-04-02 20:23:29 Read the story Jake. The plunge is primarily the result of issues related to tech stocks under fire by both left and right, and Trump's criticism of Amazon. Nothing to do with trade tensions.
692 2018-04-02 20:23:16 There expansion plans will definitely move forward after selling all stock.I think CBWTF will be like Amazon, Facebbook, and others that use to be penny stocks.Volume is still in excess of 1 mil a day
693 2018-04-02 20:23:03 Yippee another down day for stocks. Surprise surprise
694 2018-04-02 20:22:56 Don't only buy precious metals, take it to its limits if any. But don't sell stocks for that.
695 2018-04-02 20:22:55 Dow  Down 458 Points, S&P500 -58, NASDAQ -193, Russell 2000 -36.90, ... 
Trade war fears sent stocks tumbling today after China announced it would slap tariffs on 130 U.S. goods.
...Gold Up 1.3%, 
...Silver Up 1.8%
696 2018-04-02 20:22:52 Those on Wallstreet are buying stocks on credit. When interest rates go up, they are able to buy less
697 2018-04-02 20:22:50 "They add bump stocks and Echo Triggers to increase rates of fire and step as close to Title II of the federal Gun Control Act as legally possible" add this to the underlying factor, fear.
698 2018-04-02 20:22:29 We all should have foreseen that #Trump would continue his unhinged attacks on Amazon and shorted the stock. Kicking myself now. Someone should create an ETF that selectively shorts stocks run by people he is annoyed with. Lots of volatility
699 2018-04-02 20:22:17 NEW YORK (AP) Stocks closed sharply lower on Wall Street as technology companies took heavy losses and investors worried about escalating trade tensions with China.
700 2018-04-02 20:22:10 It’s too bad Amazon can’t sue him. Before he was elected it was speculated that 45 would purposefully try to manipulate the stocks of company’s with an owner he disliked! #DeadlineWH
701 2018-04-02 20:22:07 he is manipulating,  what stocks does the trump family own
702 2018-04-02 20:21:47 As the stock market plummets, we will be hearing how Obama was the cause of the 2Q stocks
703 2018-04-02 20:21:22 @realDonaldTrump @business notes that "Stocks' Second-Quarter Start Is the Worst Since the Great Depression". You like headlines like this, so this is my gift to you.
704 2018-04-02 20:21:11 You know, some people shouldn't be allowed to trade stocks.
705 2018-04-02 20:20:41 Tai loy me confirmo que mañana habra stocks de albunes de Panini de tapa dura y figuras sueltas en sus tiendas :3
706 2018-04-02 20:20:39 Surprised. Guess matter of opinion.

On stocks:
. Tariffs => slightly lower equilibrium GDP
. Higher rates than expected => lower valuations
. Higher avg realized vol (from monetary tightening) => funds de-risk

On crypto:
. Investors decimated => demand greatly curtailed
707 2018-04-02 20:19:51 Ironically when the entire federal reserve system fails. Those holding onto stocks will have nothing as stocks are backed by dollars and those with private keys will still have the value backed by usability.

708 2018-04-02 20:19:15 Wait !!! With all these US stocks tanking , we still have another millennial type stock ( Spotify ) coming in to do it's IPO
709 2018-04-02 20:19:00 Sad but true: 1) Trump is killing US prosperity w/ his “gut” instincts. 2nd Quarter this year in stocks is the worse since the Great Depression.2)Trump attacks thriving US businesses out of jealously.3) He started a trade war w/ China. 4) Trump gets “debrief”from Fox News!
710 2018-04-02 20:18:40 The S&P 500 has closed beneath the 200-day moving average for the first time since 2016 raising the question of further short term declines #markets #stocks $SPY
711 2018-04-02 20:18:26 @realDonaldTrump Stocks tumbling. Trade wars looming. Americans suffering. Is this your idea of winning?

712 2018-04-02 20:18:23 Same thing happened with $AKER, $SRNE and $AYTU. I told everyone how amazing the stocks were. Nobody knew about them. Now they have exploded from lows. There's a reason why I had 1.2k followers on stocktwits. Next runner will be $CLRB. Who wants me to draw conclusion. $NVCN $JAGX
713 2018-04-02 20:18:16 @CNBCClosingBell I have a great deal of respect for Mr. O'Leary but I doubt he could name 5 stocks that meeting his criteria that did better (or less worse) than the QQQ.
714 2018-04-02 20:18:01 Wall Street Instant Update; #Stocks close sharply lower DJIA down 459 at 23,644, Nasdaq Comp down 2.7%, S&P -2.3%; #Oil WTT falls 3% closing at $63.01/bbl; #Gold $1345.80 up 1.4;

716 2018-04-02 20:17:41 #TrumpStockMarket (I say that to enrage #CNN types, though YEAR straight up more basis for credit than 1 day for blame) has SPOILED people. Stocks don't go straight up forever.
717 2018-04-02 20:17:40 $SPX is below the 200 DMA and turned it to resistance on The daily... US stocks retreating
718 2018-04-02 20:17:22 Apparently starting a trade war with China isn't great for financial markets: 99% of all S&P stocks were negative today. Over 100 set new 52-week lows.
719 2018-04-02 20:16:38 Stocks heading down this week.
Careful not to catch a falling knife.
720 2018-04-02 20:16:36 After the company received a refuse to file letter from the FDA for a drug candidate that is designed to treat depression, shares of $ALKS fell 20%.

722 2018-04-02 20:16:29 bears still knocking tech stocks.
723 2018-04-02 20:16:25 When will the SEC look at trump's abuse of his bully pulpit to depress stocks?  I bet that Trump and cronies are shorting and profiting every week.
724 2018-04-02 20:16:21 Plus he probably told all his friends and family what stocks to dump!
725 2018-04-02 20:16:14 The largest ETF tracking emerging-market stocks took a nosedive as a selloff in global technology companies spurred a surge in volatility. iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF slumped 2.6 percent. BBG
726 2018-04-02 20:16:09 Haha hahaha let the stocks tank !! Come on recession #2 , no one to blame but #realDonaldTrump and the morons that voted for him
727 2018-04-02 20:15:39 This seems to fly in the face of research highlighted in Jeremy Siegel's Stocks for the Long Run, which shows that dividend-paying companies outperform non-dividend paying companies over time.
728 2018-04-02 20:15:19 Earlier my brain gave me the idea of walking down the street and hearing like a middle-aged businessman say into his phone "Siri, bing the best company to buy stocks in. Yes, I'll hold."
729 2018-04-02 20:15:11 US stocks plummet to start the week, markets wrap: Dow down 1.90%, S&P 500 down 2.23%, NASDAQ down 2.74%. S&P 500 closes below 200 day moving average.
730 2018-04-02 20:15:07 Will #stocks bounce back tomorrow, w/o any real change in #economic outlook (as was true  of drop today)? Entirely possible, though hardly sure thing. Has happened often, as short-term #ComputerTraders bounce market up & down.
731 2018-04-02 20:14:40 @buggys1 offloading do not hold anything, i never hold any stocks, thats how u get caught bagholding =) just stick to the strategy.

734 2018-04-02 20:14:26 Crypto will get rekt just like stocks. We can see that they are correlated, at least for the last year.

It's fake news
It's deep state
I like when stocks are low so I can buy*
(They know damn well they don't know what stocks are)
It's not Trump's fault, he doesn't even know the stock market
The stock market is lying

"Stocks' Second-Quarter Start Is the Worst Since the Great Depression"

We arent eveb half way into 2nd Q... and to date, since election of Trump, market is up around 30%.
737 2018-04-02 20:14:14 Hi Paula, can you let me know which store it is you are searching for the product in? I have found the product and it still has deliveries scheduled in other stores so it may be that your store no longer stocks it. Thanks – Lee
738 2018-04-02 20:14:04 Stocks sell off as trade, tech worries drag prices down

748 2018-04-02 20:12:00 It should be illegal to manipulate stocks the way you do.  You do realize that your tweets result in changes to the stock market.  If you haven't figured that out yet, you're a little slow.

755 2018-04-02 20:08:58 Still trying to figure out, first I have seen crypto up while regular stocks are down.
756 2018-04-02 20:08:47 As of today's close.. we're FINALLY seeing near capitulatory levels of volume into Down vs Up stocks compared to the overall Advance/Decline which is causing the TRIN to register NORTH of 2.50 today. while the Equity Put/call now over 1.25. these are both important to monitor
757 2018-04-02 20:08:11 Why are cyber security stocks down when there are growing political and economic tension? We all know cyber attacks are weaponised for political and economic reasons, so shouldn’t the cybersecurity sector’s revenue go up?

761 2018-04-02 20:07:23 @realDonaldTrump So sad the USA has a dumb dumb for president who knows too little to keep his fat nose out of the free market. You are tanking the stocks almost weekly but can’t figure it out. Come on Donnie little hands. Go find a nee girl friend and resign.

784 2018-04-02 20:03:11 and you must love that Trump who is a businessman is trashing Amazon and has trade wars so bad stocks are plumetting. His mouth will be the countries downfall. He talks of idiots and he needs to look in the mirror

797 2018-04-02 19:59:50 Good point Richard. This idiot in the WH is causing stocks to rise and fall at the pace he can post a Twitter.
798 2018-04-02 19:59:40 I have several links in a row that tell me falling stocks are because of a tech backlash, China, the President and Apple maybe using their own chips. Good day to remind yourself about the difference between correlation and causation.

801 2018-04-02 19:58:47 When stocks go up, the president takes the credit. When his tariffs cause stocks to drop, not a peep.
802 2018-04-02 19:58:33 Radio knew this would be bad when this happened investment bankers bought up the big companies & you see this happening.  The average listener doesn't know it's propaganda I'm sure it like this in other mediums where stocks & dividends come into play.   is in the headline now
803 2018-04-02 19:58:04 Wouldn't that person be TRUMP the DOTARD, who also did that to Boeing? Um yeah. I wouldn't invest until that jerk is OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE, because he clearly is manipulating stocks.

807 2018-04-02 19:57:36 Who owns stocks? 

Every day Americans. Anyone who has 401k, everyone who invested in stock market. If stock go up, Americans win.

823 2018-04-02 19:55:12 It's not a conspiracy theory, Nobody can define an assault rifle. They think AR-15s are the problem even though they make up less than 5% of gun violence. and i think the quote from the rally was "when they give us an in, like bump stocks, we'll take a mile"

827 2018-04-02 19:54:04 Since stocks have been going down, I was thinking it's a good time buy, but then I think it's gonna be a long depressing Summer. Better to liquidate and buy again, later.

829 2018-04-02 19:53:41 US equities tumbled on Monday, with tech stocks faring worst. S&P500 down 2.8% to a two-month low, bond yields lower, and US dollar is slightly higher. Possibly contributing to the moves were the announcement of retaliatory tariffs by China and Trump’s criticism of Amazon.
830 2018-04-02 19:53:38 My take on this market session - we have hit the bottom because We are only 175 points off the low. I went all in today on the stocks I tweeted about below.
831 2018-04-02 19:53:34 They do not need to do this explicitly for it to be a problem: cherry picking, survivorship bias, hidden correlations, cognitive bias all factor in when performance is calculated ex post facto.

Select (and publish) stocks first. Then track performance. Not the other way around.

836 2018-04-02 19:52:29 You’re right-I’m not uninformed. 1:What is an assault rifle? The actual definition is something that switches from semi-auto to auto. Those are already not legal. 2:Even the NRA supported ATF in reviewing whether bump stocks should be regulated. Highly doubt it will be effective.
837 2018-04-02 19:52:19 Let's make stocks great again!!!!
838 2018-04-02 19:52:10 Decided to not swing anything overnight except a small gamble on $TVIX 
Holding stocks overnight during this shaky market is risky IMO
839 2018-04-02 19:51:28 I wish I could buy into your club I’m doing poorly in the stocks two months ago I was up nearly 20,000 no it’s more like 8000 I’m getting afraid daily. Down almost $2700 today and it has been the same way for  a while n I’m a small peanuts gal so the loss is huge for me
840 2018-04-02 19:50:58 But that animosity (on both sides) is not new. Why are you doing worse while Trump says America is back to being great? I would guess you don't have a lot of stocks that have increased in value. How is your world better than a year ago?

So that's that one debunked
844 2018-04-02 19:50:07 To all the oh-so creative and brilliant “guns don’t kill people, people kill people” folks out there who are against background checks, banning bump stocks & automatic weapons of war because it won’t work, I simply say this: HOW ABOUT WE AT LEAST FUCKING TRY IT AND SEE?

846 2018-04-02 19:49:37 CC aren't stocks. They act like them in terms of how they fluctuate in price and the sheer number of altcoins creates a market for them but the idea is to narrow down to only having a few CCs and eventually to using one single CC for everyday use.

861 2018-04-02 19:46:51 Not sure I follow you. 

Are you suggesting that they select the stocks that performed (past) well for their portfolio? That’s a ken to a time machine, or a lie.

883 2018-04-02 19:40:33 i guess that story isn’t really the “point” here. It doesn’t change where we are right now, and the marketplace is reacting to that. stocks wouldn’t be up or level if we all “knew more specifics” about the tariffs already in place, IMO.

I'm missing something here and if someone would kindly explain Capitalism to me I would appreciate it. I'm at another crazy loss for words.
889 2018-04-02 19:39:07 Stocks are rekt today. Meanwhile my $POE $VIBE and $BNB are doin' aiiiiight. Feels good for a change.

890 2018-04-02 19:38:58 Yes Icahn who is known for manipulating stocks by promoting known pyramid schemes that were shorted because they were being exposed.
891 2018-04-02 19:38:27 Also snopes: 1921 to 1933 ..."None of these presidents attempted to regulate the buying or selling of stocks and bonds; they exercised no controls over banking, manufacturing, or agricultural production. Likewise, no attempt was made to gather or analyze statistics..." 1/3
892 2018-04-02 19:38:13 Class action suit against Trump? I'm in.

Remember that this also includes any mutual funds or ETFs that also include those stocks.
893 2018-04-02 19:37:51 So... are they all “Trump Stocks” now?
894 2018-04-02 19:37:44 Stocks off to their worst April start in 90 years, Bespoke Investment tells clients; this on top of the first losing quarter for U.S. equities in more than two years. Treasury prices rise as risk-off trade accelerates

This sell off is FAR from finished
900 2018-04-02 19:36:06 (stocks up on smoothies and iced coffee)
901 2018-04-02 19:35:53 I assume you are not uninformed, but I’ll repeat what hundreds have already said:

There’s room for a bi-partisan dialogue on banning assault rifles, banning bump stocks, removing gunshow loopholes, universal background checks, etc, etc.
902 2018-04-02 19:35:44 Retweeted Brian Krassenstein (@krassenstein):

This is officially the worst start to the second quarter of the year for stocks since the Great Depression.

I just can't take all this winning!!
903 2018-04-02 19:35:41 Charting penny stocks,not good
904 2018-04-02 19:35:34 He took credit for Obama's stocks last year this is his actual stocks and he sucks lmaoooo
905 2018-04-02 19:34:42 Donald  Trump  is attacking  amazon because  he has problems with  owner  ,Jeff Bezos  hs many different  views  than trump  stating   Amazon should  pay more  tax  let's how about  your  tax trump   u are killing  my stocks  STOP
906 2018-04-02 19:34:31 I was so happy March was done ... hello April #stocks #selloff #tradetariffs
907 2018-04-02 19:34:11 U.S. stocks are on track to have their worst April start since 1929, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The S&P 500 index slumped 2.4% as of 1:10 p.m. in New York, a rout exceeded only by its 2.5% decline 89 years ago, ...'
908 2018-04-02 19:34:10 Two trading rules. 
1. Never play drug stocks. 
2. Short into strengthen.
909 2018-04-02 19:33:34 Trump knows well that small business and the suffering Retail make up for more than 50% of American jobs not Amazon.  Richest 10% own 84% of stocks past week (Amazon stock going down!) No one wants Amazon to go away, just play fair.  Do you invest in Stocks?
910 2018-04-02 19:33:29 Stocks on track for worst start to April since the Great Depression
911 2018-04-02 19:33:19 1)U.S. stocks are tumbling Monday after China officially raised import duties on U.S. pork, apples and other products. It's too soon to call it the beginning of a trade war, but for now, investors aren't sticking around to find out.
912 2018-04-02 19:32:41 I will never play drug stocks.
913 2018-04-02 19:32:37 WHY is noone asking who is profiting off these calculated statements of his (crafted to appear off-the-cuff) re: stocks?????
914 2018-04-02 19:32:14 Dear Trump,
Please shut the f#%k up.

Sincerely,
Stocks
915 2018-04-02 19:32:01 JP Morgan estimates that computers manipulate stocks 9 times as often as humans. I believe the volatility we are seeing is due to the computer (AI) selling and then buying frenzied we are seeing in the Stockmarkets!!
916 2018-04-02 19:31:11 Sucks for our economy though!Good time to buy penny and dime stocks!
917 2018-04-02 19:30:47 Bad time to ipo when tech stocks are out of favor.
918 2018-04-02 19:30:39 They sell stocks at a higher prices to workers on payday. Poor sxhmucks don’t even know what’s going on. So sad.
919 2018-04-02 19:30:30 Why continued calm for stocks depends on credit markets
Can markets repeat the outstanding performance of 2017? #outlook #creditmarkets
920 2018-04-02 19:30:24 BREAKING: Stocks fall sharply as trade tensions mount with China; Dow Jones industrial average sinks more than 600 points.
921 2018-04-02 19:30:20 You are completely correct. How many people did he tip off to his tweets and comments about Amazon and steel and aluminum tariffs BEFORE he made the tweets and comments? His family and friends were shorting the markets and selected stocks, I am sure.
922 2018-04-02 19:30:17 I’m down close to 30% of stock value. Since the accidental president took office, cryptocurrencies stopped making money, ETF stay flat, and individual stocks aren’t earning much with loses in aggregate. I really hate everyone who voted for @realDonaldTrump
923 2018-04-02 19:30:03 There is only one side of the market and it is not the bull side or the bear side, but the right side. #forex #stocks
924 2018-04-02 19:30:02 BS ,Check today Stocks WINNING
925 2018-04-02 19:29:48 @realDonaldTrump how’s the stocks doing today, open that mouth some more let’s see how much further it will drop tomorrow. You have a lot to say when it’s up but not a peep out of you when it’s down.
926 2018-04-02 19:29:44 I  just got a booklet from the Facebook Securities Litigation   Even their IPO was screwed up and I got screwed.   Bunch of legal stuff - not sure what it is yet, but a questionnaire about the purchase of stocks during their IPO.  Yep, I got some.
927 2018-04-02 19:29:32 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS toldl #EasterEggRoll  children about #DACa and your puffed up ecomony today ratehr than an inspiring note of rebirth on a day when your ecnomy was tanking "Stocks' Second-Quarter Start Is the Worst Since the Great Depression
By Rachel Evans and Lu Wang
928 2018-04-02 19:29:19 trump regularly pushes for stocks of companies he doesn't like to drop. If his marriage failing, somehow, saved one 401k from dropping in value, and my hoping his marriage would fail, somehow, made it fail, I'd hope for it constantly.
929 2018-04-02 19:29:16 Lmao as long as trump is president stocks don’t make sense it’s fucked
930 2018-04-02 19:29:00 This your subtle way of going bear on stocks?
931 2018-04-02 19:28:58 Genius! Stocks drop, people buy more, price goes up, he makes even more millions!
932 2018-04-02 19:28:57 Maybe people would save or invest more if they didn’t confuse cash with wealth, and they were educated on other forms of value storage like metals, commodities, currencies, bonds and stocks. Also, on the imminence of inflation and depreciation of fiat money.
933 2018-04-02 19:28:35 The Liberals have blinders on !! They must not ever check their stocks, retirement accounts, or 401 K’s !!!
934 2018-04-02 19:28:34 How you know it's serious: Falling stocks swamping rising issues by 5 to 1 ratio today. Few people interested in catching a falling knife. Dow -2.6%, -620 with 30 mins to go. Nasdaq -3.2%, S&P -2.9%.
935 2018-04-02 19:28:21 Someone using the office of president to manipulate stocks? There should be a class-action law suit and criminal charges.
936 2018-04-02 19:27:47 Agree. Reasonable stance. Also high capacity magazines and bump stocks should be the purview of the military only.
937 2018-04-02 19:27:18 Blatant disregard for common sense
938 2018-04-02 19:27:12 What’s yo $5k?  Stocks falling due to trump trade wars and tech fears as reported
939 2018-04-02 19:27:06 Is it legal for him to use the office of Presidency to manipulate stocks by going after specific companys? Seems illegal.
940 2018-04-02 19:26:58 What do you have against tax cuts ! Dodge truck coming back to Detroit from Mexico? Our borders are going to be protected? Black and Spanish unemployment at the lowest it's ever been ! Stocks doing well ? And N Korean not trying to kill us ?
941 2018-04-02 19:26:57 Actually Stocks are at an all time high,  unless you listen to LIBERAL media!!!LMAO
942 2018-04-02 19:25:55 Penny stocks!
943 2018-04-02 19:25:49 A president using the office to manipulate stocks and nobody'seems alarmed??? Sweet jews for jesus...what next?
944 2018-04-02 19:25:33 Very true, unfortunately a loss isnt just replaced by cause other stocks went up. People unless very wealthy are usually in funds, indexes and contracts. These do not recover if the underlying investment crashes.
945 2018-04-02 19:25:28 “U.S. stocks are on track to have their worst April start since 1929. The S&P 500 index slumped 2.4% as of 1:10 p.m. in NY, a rout exceeded only by its 2.5% decline 89 years ago, a prelude to the devastating crash later that year that brought on the Great Depression,” -@business
946 2018-04-02 19:25:16 gold this year has been performing an absolute basis, but more importantly on a relative basis. Assets in uptrends tend to outperform their alternatives. In this case Gold > Stocks & Bonds $GLD $GC_F $TLT $IEF $SPY $SPX
947 2018-04-02 19:25:03 The opportunities lie with the US growers in the private sector, not the publicly trading stocks.
948 2018-04-02 19:24:54 So wait, you are putting down Amazon again so their stocks will go down? Do you talk to all your rich friends before you Tweet? Isn't this insider trading?!? You so need to go to jail! Oh, and thanks for tanking the DOW! You do not care about Americans!!!
949 2018-04-02 19:24:48 #diversification is flat out working. Yes, still down but not as much as these morons who buy blue chip stocks and think they’re safe! #gold and some #bonds up; #amlp not down as much, #eem down as much as s&p500 but on up days #eem been outperforming
950 2018-04-02 19:24:28 Stocks fall sharply as the President rage tweets about people richer than him*

Fixed it for ya.
951 2018-04-02 19:24:18 I suspect this is not careless, but carefully manipulated for personal gain and control. When stocks are low, it is a good time to buy. Who is buying Amazon and other stocks that seem in the way of opposing the President. Which of his backers is buying the most?
952 2018-04-02 19:24:13 Did you attribute the 30% up move in stocks from 11/16 to 12/17 to Trump?
953 2018-04-02 19:24:07 You fucking up my stocks bitch @realDonaldTrump
954 2018-04-02 19:23:54 Everyone has a plan until stocks drop 3%. 

-Michael Tyson
955 2018-04-02 19:23:23 It's almost worthy of asking the SEC to check whether or not Donald and/or those close to him heavily shorted certain stocks over the weekend, ain't it?
956 2018-04-02 19:23:18 The bond market prices debt. As interest rates get higher people borrow less to bet on stocks m. Look up “flattening of yeild curve” and see what happened historically ;)
957 2018-04-02 19:22:50 Trump once again influencing Amazon's stocks like a child who has discovered a new toy. This man is dangerous to our democracy and needs to be stopped!
958 2018-04-02 19:22:24 Trump attacks Amazon; stock plummets!

Trump attacks NAFTA; stocks plummet.

Trump says he’ll set tariffs on imports; China reciprocates. Stocks plummet.

Did you suffer a head injury?
959 2018-04-02 19:22:16 market sentiment making things worse and panic is contagious. Some people panic and sold. But seriously, if the stocks/bags you are holding are  nearly bottom, why rush to sell? $play $hs $uav I think these are very much the bottom
960 2018-04-02 19:22:15 #GOLD For the first time in two years I am taking my money out of stocks and putting it in Gold. I don't trust our  current president any longer. He is going to trash our economy with his trade wars, budget deficits and other bad economic decisions.
961 2018-04-02 19:21:25 Y'all forgot bitcoin. #BTC stocks larger than expected, drought in ARG did not reduce yield
962 2018-04-02 19:21:23 Very dumb indeed because they are also owned by the same Institutional Investors who monopolize industries by buying stocks of competing firms within the same industry and are really just trusts in sheep's clothing. e.g Vanguard Group is a shareholder in all these retailers.
963 2018-04-02 19:20:44 They know one of their peers had one and mowed down 17 of their other peers. They know more first hand of the lethality than you ever will. Now pat yourself on the back bec you’re familiar with makes and calibers and stocks and semi auto and bolt action. Congrats, you wanna be.
964 2018-04-02 19:20:36 More on the crush. USDA lifted its estimate of Jan crush a minor 0.1 million bu. For the soyoil, Jan stocks were up about 20 million lbs from last month's first est. Feb soyoil stocks totaled 2425 mln lbs. Stocks were higher than trade avg of 2350 mln lbs. High fcst 2391 mln lbs.

968 2018-04-02 19:18:44 It’s only been one trading day into the quarter, so calm down. Anyone who knows anything about business or investment realizes that stocks are based on earnings and when those reports come out in the coming weeks. Believe me, they’re going to be real good and the stock prices too
969 2018-04-02 19:18:36 If you don't feed him raw meat he will. (Sorry, channeling Addams Family.)

The tech stocks feel a bit like a stealth 2000-2001, but they are much bigger companies and have matured a lot.  There is still a need for yield. Down/sideways for a while but no crash. What you said.

His ability to test this theory, will determine how he can manipulate other stocks down the road

995 2018-04-02 19:12:51 what ever happened with Carl Icahn dumping $30M in steel stocks day before trump announced tariff on steel? I'd sue if I had bought that stock.
996 2018-04-02 19:12:40 Stop bashing American business and American Stocks. Are you shorting these companies?
997 2018-04-02 19:12:33 Watching Shep on Fox News discussing major losses in stocks today following China retaliation on tariffs. All on agree Trump lying about Amazon. Amazing to watch. Implication is DT is using position to influence stock prices. #Resist

1012 2018-04-02 19:09:56 The way people were talking about bitcoin they were sure that shit was gonna be an integrated form of currency. I know how stocks work. I’m jus commenting on the fact that so many people believed bitcoin couldn’t crash in general
1013 2018-04-02 19:09:55 Moving up the capital structure was a good call for 2018. Bonds to outpace stocks in 2018 if things close here.

1015 2018-04-02 19:09:42 I stopped investing in stocks directly when Trump became president. I felt like his presence would create upheaval in markets and that I'm not smart enough to know how to profit from such uncertainty.

1018 2018-04-02 19:08:46 well that’s what stocks do..................................
1019 2018-04-02 19:08:43 I don’t really like conglomerate stocks. If I wanted to diversify my portfolio, I’d do that by myself. When I pick a stock, I expect that the stock has a core competence in it’s industry or sector.
1020 2018-04-02 19:08:36 Tech stocks? You mean, every* stock? Smh what a killer of a day
1021 2018-04-02 19:08:16 Stocks are under intense and persistent distribution. !

#BTFD?
1022 2018-04-02 19:08:10 People are saying this is the accumulation period and the stock market dropping is proof

Yes, stocks will continue to sell off as money moves into crypto but...

Stocks have a lot more to drop this month, and until they do, I'm not worried that this is the bottom for $BTC
1023 2018-04-02 19:08:07 Trade, tech questions weigh on US stocks
1024 2018-04-02 19:08:07 Hope your stocks are in check.  #disaster Your Dad is off his Meds.  Better give him A call. #sad what he is doing to this country
1025 2018-04-02 19:08:06 The post office losing just like my stocks. Since you brag when things are good, brag and tell me how you gonna fix this
1026 2018-04-02 19:07:54 I am not shocked that #google, #facebook, or #twitter collects and sells data about their users. Nothing is free. I am not shocked that tech #stocks plunge, they've been overvalued for too long. I am shocked that so many people and media act surprised.
1027 2018-04-02 19:07:54 Someone should investigate if SPANKEE DOTARD @realdonaldtrump 's family, @seanhannity , Koch Bros. and other friends had puts in Amazon stocks. There won't be any other reason for this IDIOT to drive stock market down. @GOP @SenSchumer @Cabinet @potus
1028 2018-04-02 19:07:52 Trump has done this other times, with the loss of value in stocks.  Everyone is losing money, but those who are richer have a very large cushion.  The GOP Administration is killing smaller investors, who most likely cannot afford a lawyer.  It's obscene.
1029 2018-04-02 19:07:50 Tesla stocks dropped after the model x car was on autopilot when it crashed and killed someone ://
1030 2018-04-02 19:07:46 Maybe watching their stocks crash is giving them the runs??
1031 2018-04-02 19:07:45 I bet Trump anonymously shorted Amazon before he started his tweet war with them! He probably laughing all the way to the bank! #Stocks #Trading #StockMarket #Forex
1032 2018-04-02 19:07:04 @realdonaldtrump is attacking @amazon and he started a trade war. As a result, stocks, especially tech stocks, are being tumbling.  If #maga owned stocks they would be concerned.  When they see layoffs, they'll be furious.  Gas prices now rising. This @potus is dangerous.
1033 2018-04-02 19:06:56 *checks her $50 worth of stocks* I’m good.
1034 2018-04-02 19:06:51 How come no one on CNBC is talking about the Defensive stocks ?  I have been watching every second for 1-month now,  5 days a week, and the fixation is on FANG (inducing fear).  #FakeNewsCNN
1035 2018-04-02 19:06:29 @realDonaldTrump American Stocks 
1036 2018-04-02 19:06:24 Richard, I think amazon stockholders need a class action lawsuit. Also, how likely is it that Trump and company are profiting off of manipulating the stocks?  This is an OUTRAGE.
1037 2018-04-02 19:06:17 Yeah, my stocks plummeted an average of $7 a share each.. lost a boatload today
1038 2018-04-02 19:05:41 Is our president con man attempting to manipulate the stock market?  Does he have anyone clandestinely buying and selling stocks as the market falls and rises on his messaging?  Anyone interested in finding out?
1039 2018-04-02 19:05:40 De cerrar así el s&p lo haría por debajo de la media de 200 sesiones .... me da un poco de miedo , algunas acciones aguantando bien . UPLD y SEDG, el resto las veo de capa caída , como no venga un rebote pronto me da miedo .
1040 2018-04-02 19:05:11 @SEC_News Hey, you might wanna do something about our jackass of a president single-handedly tanking some pretty big stocks lately. Aren't you supposed to be "protecting investors?" HELLO?!!?!?!?
1041 2018-04-02 19:05:00 How come no one on CNBC is talking about the Defensive stocks ?  I have been watching every second for 1-month now,  5 days a week, and the fixation is on FANG (inducing fear).
1042 2018-04-02 19:04:34 Ahora toca operar en corto (el q quiera) o recuperar capital y quedar a la espera!
1043 2018-04-02 19:03:51 Stock market is doing something that hasn't been done since 1929...the year before the Great Depression. Stocks keep taking hit after hit
1044 2018-04-02 19:03:48 Its because of tech stocks and I'm okay with it even though I'm losing too
1045 2018-04-02 19:03:42 .@realdonaldtrump Who does @potus think he is hurting by crashing Amazon stock? How many 401k's have Amazon in their portfolio? Then there is starting a China trade war killing other stocks, market down ~700
A Tariff is a Tax, passed to All families by raising prices on goods...
1046 2018-04-02 19:03:17 There are a range of options, many hard to argue with, others to be explored.  Domestic abuse / violent crime conviction restrictions, mandatory reporting, loophole closing, long rifle magazine size rules, weapon modification restriction (bump stocks)
1047 2018-04-02 19:02:44 Make sure to freeze your credit reports with Equifax, Experian & Trans Union while they continue to bullshit & lie & pretend to care about your private information which, by the way, was sold in stocks by CEO's 2 days before Equifax security breach. Coincidence? No such thing...
1048 2018-04-02 19:02:11 Lottery, Vegas, stocks, cryptocurrencies are all a gamble and there is no guarantee there will be a profit in the future. If you don't already know this on your own, you have bigger problems to worry about than Ripple and XRP
1049 2018-04-02 19:01:58 Hey, @realDonaldTrump. this is officially the worst start to the second quarter of the year for stocks since the Great Depression, and it's all because of YOU. Between your tariffs, your attacks on Amazon/Washington Post, and your general incompetence, this is YOUR fault!

1058 2018-04-02 18:58:49 Amazon stocks are falling rapidly because of the Resident. Go shopping. His pods are not buying. Since when does a POTUS make people lose jobs by putting down a business? It's The Washington Post, Bezos owns that's really bothering him.
1059 2018-04-02 18:58:19 I cannot believe I am seeing lawsuit talk on here about losses from owning stocks.  Come on and grow up.  Are you going to sue the SNB for not buying enough $AMZN ?
1060 2018-04-02 18:58:19 All faang stocks in trouble
1061 2018-04-02 18:57:30 Wonder if he is short on $AMZN or other tech stocks?
1062 2018-04-02 18:57:19 Correction......

No reason to buy stocks when you have a crazy person as the president with one tweet he tries to undo corporations.

Trish Regan.... Does not have a crystal ball off the financial experts they don't either.
1063 2018-04-02 18:57:19 Aye a know it’s shite bud! Ruins a good atmosphere!
1064 2018-04-02 18:57:14 How is this shit with Trump bashing individual companies and killing stocks anything close to legal?.WTF?, now he's going to invite Putin here and the taxpayers he screwed are going to pay for it!.(How about a reach around first?)
1065 2018-04-02 18:57:05 How come u are silent on the stocks we need ur help please!
1066 2018-04-02 18:56:49 Don't feel bad about the op-ed writer getting taken to the Internet stocks over her lazy anti-Semitism. She'll probably get an HBO series out of it.

1068 2018-04-02 18:56:23 On the plus side... if you make your contribution now, stocks will be cheap?
1069 2018-04-02 18:56:04 Are you in stocks or bonds??
1070 2018-04-02 18:55:41 Stocks at all time high this tariffs crap is to get countries to the table and in a first ever China wants to talk everyone wants to talk now so I predict my shore house is paid off by this time next year!!! Everything won't happen at once I'll wait I've waited 8 years!!!
1071 2018-04-02 18:55:40 I'd say 500 by the closing bell. Trump's rich cronies are going to snap up plummeting stocks -- because wasn't that the whole point?
1072 2018-04-02 18:55:39 This is officially the worst start to the second quarter of the year for stocks since the Great Depression.

I just can't take all this winning!!
1073 2018-04-02 18:55:28 look, I get wanting to find reasons to bring lawsuits against Trump, but could you maybe come up with one that poor people could participate in? Most of us don't have enough money to be throwing around trading stocks or securities or hiring securities lawyers...
1074 2018-04-02 18:55:14 $aytu Agreed.  Holding up well, good chart, good story.  Compare chart to $AKER and do DD on timing of Bigger Capital investment in both stocks.  $AYTU chart is where $AKER was back in January.  Good stuff coming, IMO.
1075 2018-04-02 18:55:05 Stocks move a leg lower ... Dow -620 points as China raises tariffs, tech wreck.
1076 2018-04-02 18:55:05 Buy these 3 bio tech stocks and save a lot of patients lives and be blessed and prosperd SPHS,GERN and MNKD.
1077 2018-04-02 18:54:54 How can you be so sure? Don't doubt that there are those buying and selling stocks based on what Trump is about to tweet. Only way we would know for sure would be if the government still had an agency that would look into insider trading.
1078 2018-04-02 18:54:46 Now it Trump's fault tech stocks are crumbling because of weak security
1079 2018-04-02 18:54:39 Tepper must think stocks are REALLY a bargain NOW, if since he said they seemed just as cheap in Jan 2018 as they were in Jan 2017
1080 2018-04-02 18:54:35 Rumor: Apple plans to ditch Intel CPUs in favor of their own chips. Stocks tumble and Internet blows up in two ways:

1. Greatest decision ever.
2. Worst decision ever.

Essentially the same reaction when Apple left PPC for Intel 12 years ago.

Life will go on no matter what.
1081 2018-04-02 18:54:33 Anybody can screen shot stocks  betting is a side gig. 3k a week for the strip club and kids tuition. Come on man.  Be better then that. But we appreciate he Cardinals tweet ;-) #imitationIsTheBiggestFormOfFlattery
1082 2018-04-02 18:54:29 Stocks ALWAYS DROP in the morning and rise in the afternoon NO REASON TO HAVE A COW ABOUT IT!
1083 2018-04-02 18:54:28 Don't panic. The stock market goes up and down. That's how people make money on stocks. Also remember Wall Street is the house and just like Vegas, the house always wins. If you can't afford to lose, don't play.
1084 2018-04-02 18:54:26 Then why am I licking my chops, ready to buy more stocks at value?
1085 2018-04-02 18:54:19 Pro-tip: Don’t check the technology stocks right now. Yikes.
1086 2018-04-02 18:54:19 Wow!!  700 pts down! The more @realDonaldTrump opens his mouth the more AMERICANS LOSE.  Stocks have LOST 3000 PTS AND HEADING TOWARDS 4000 PTS.  now is this #THEARTOFTHEDEAL ?? @jaketapper @JoyAnnReid @foxandfriends @NBCNews @EdKrassen @AC360

1099 2018-04-02 18:51:28 Another reason I hate stocks. Any Dick n Jane can say 1 thing out of their mouth and numbers magically drop. Why are the stocks tied to peoples emotions.
1100 2018-04-02 18:51:21 Wow...you surely...hopefully don’t invest in stocks....at least don’t give out advice
1101 2018-04-02 18:51:11 Lol that's thing right. Soon we will see what the market value some of these weed stocks that get a liscen . Cann still has more things up thier sleave imho .

1104 2018-04-02 18:50:39 Hey our president is making stocks plummet because of offhand remarks that are baseless lies. Happy 2018!
1105 2018-04-02 18:49:57 $AMZN is doing what I expected it to do. Swing short with target at $1,293. This is one of the most overvalued stocks. Wait for the margin calls and this baby may fly to $1,100 +/-. Great company tho 
1106 2018-04-02 18:49:51 Come on, John. This is POPULISM in action ... The wealthy who own stocks are taking this hit ...

#Trump has failed at nearly every company he’s ever touched goes after one of the most successful businessman, @JeffBezos who created an ideal bus. model & company that employees 450K+ and drives our Market Economy! #Investors & #stocks overreact to rhetoric.
1112 2018-04-02 18:47:07 Yes, there are some small positives breadth-wise (positive divergences) and many stocks still are holding well/base-building normally. But until the trend turns, caution is clearly the order of the day if you're a position trader.
1113 2018-04-02 18:46:53 I’m glad we caught these bad guys and thankfully no assault weapons or AR15s or bump stocks were on the table of arms confiscated

1116 2018-04-02 18:46:02 i still expect the stock market to recover. not enough bears to bring it down yet. most of the dumping has been in tech stocks after bullshit news. it will be bought back up.

1128 2018-04-02 18:44:42 We banned automatic knives and knife bump stocks.
1129 2018-04-02 18:44:37 Especially weed stocks getting hammered . Closer we get to legalization I have a good feeling the market will price the compaines on revenue . Liscen facilities ect. I do not see a crazy run on weed stocks . But the right ones soon to be liscen cam have a nice jump
1130 2018-04-02 18:44:11 This is officially the worst start to the second quarter of the year for stocks since the Great Depression.

I just can't take all this winning
1131 2018-04-02 18:44:07 Seven tweets this morning and nothing to say about the #stocks . Weird,  @realDonaldTrump , did something happen?
1132 2018-04-02 18:43:45 I am getting out of the stocks before trump and Putin weaken us financially! Beware! This democracy is in grave danger!
1133 2018-04-02 18:43:15 $spx is oversold intra-day, and there could be a rally leading into the close in an attempt to hold the 200 day moving average around 2590. April is an historically positive month for the index. The intermediate term continues to look weak. #stocks #stockmarket #stocktrader
1134 2018-04-02 18:43:08 OMG yes! Love them. An excellent source of really good info! I feel like my retirement fund planning is good so far. My goal was to increase the liquid assets where there's no early w/d fee, tax penalties etc. Stable stocks w/decent dividends that I can just keep reinvesting.
1135 2018-04-02 18:43:08 Saw another opportunity sold earlier, I’m not sure on Weed stocks they all seem blah. There is still lots of unknowns before legalization, IMO. I still might jump back in.
1136 2018-04-02 18:43:05 So @POTUS picks a public fight with China over trade and guess what: The Chinese refuse to play the part of door mat. The upshot: Stocks swoon. Was this really the smartest way for the US to approach a complex question? Oh, right. We don't do subtlety any longer.
1137 2018-04-02 18:42:28 I didn’t see in the weather report that it was raining stocks today

1144 2018-04-02 18:41:34 Imagine a businessman like @realDonaldTrump having the power to make a statement that would cause stocks to fluctuate this much whilst letting his friends know, who are actively trading on the Dow Jones.
1145 2018-04-02 18:41:33 People have actually Dumped Microsoft stocks. Pretty sure the world is gonna end. Crazy stuff. Look up all the programs we use from them. Scary actually.
1146 2018-04-02 18:41:20 I don't own Amazon stocks but Trump is making me lose money in my IRA bcuz of his bad judgement and his non-stop lies. We didn't ask for this. We didn't ask for any of this. This is cruel and unusual punishment.

1150 2018-04-02 18:40:52 Keep this up on amzn I am not going to vote for you again..this is wrong in your methods..you are hurting us that own these stocks and I am beginning to think your ego is driving this..handle it privately

1152 2018-04-02 18:40:31 And Trump causes stocks to dive...again. Good thing not retiring tomorrow. 401ks tanked today. #DoofusDon
1153 2018-04-02 18:40:28 Stocks are good and all but they’re way too volatile to put all your money in 
1154 2018-04-02 18:40:07 April is usually a good month for stocks, but major averages in a big hole to start the quarter. On pace for worst first day of a quarter since: 
Q1 1932 for Dow
Q4 1998 for S&P 500
Q3 2002 for Nasdaq
1155 2018-04-02 18:40:05 It’s not just Intel. All tech stocks are way down right now. Probably unrelated to Apple’s non-announcement rumor.
1156 2018-04-02 18:40:04 the top 50 stocks traded have the most retail money in them,, pick one,, and go short/buy puts.  $googl just broke past $1000.. this 'aint good'
1157 2018-04-02 18:39:54 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
1158 2018-04-02 18:38:57 I was talking to my stepmom late last night and she was saying how much her stocks had lost recently I told her to wait till today because China just put tariffs on US goods. Even a blind man could see this coming. Thanks, Donnie, you ignorant mofo.
1159 2018-04-02 18:38:49 Putting every other mistake aside, the offloading of Jones and Osborne has killed us. We'd be in mid-table with them. Stupid, stupid moves. Fenty should be in the stocks for this alone. #gtfc
1160 2018-04-02 18:38:44 The mood is turning against overvalued growth tech stocks.
1161 2018-04-02 18:38:41 Percent of Stocks Above 200-Day Average INDEX: 44.01 (Falling)
1162 2018-04-02 18:38:35 @realDonaldTrump could you please just keep your mouth shut and make policies then publicize them? This whole personnel opinion on Amazon, tariffs, trade happens to be killing the stocks market and us poor saps who invested in “Make America Great” plan
1163 2018-04-02 18:38:29 wtf trump tanking the stocks just by speaking lmaooo
1164 2018-04-02 18:38:16 His friend dumped 32 million in steel stocks right before the tariffs. They are doing this on purpose.  Unfortunately the GOP runs everything so there will be no investigation.  They are making Martha's insider trading look like child's play.
1165 2018-04-02 18:37:38 You better hurry and sell all your stocks
1166 2018-04-02 18:37:33 I have instructed my UK pension fund to stop investing in US stocks immediately. Your President is a total liability to impartiality
1167 2018-04-02 18:37:19 The close below the 200 day moving average for $SPY is an important event, for the indices; from a technical point of view. #spy #ES_F #stocks #trading #bearish #dxy
1168 2018-04-02 18:36:34 A much respected boss told me "you short stocks that are going down, not ones that are going up", then did a sort of disgusted people-are-such-morons shrug, over and over again during the dot com boom.
1169 2018-04-02 18:36:32 $HIMX of all stocks to be up today... lol Guess that $6 low is now solid.
1170 2018-04-02 18:36:21 I think you boycotted education and common sense.
The Starbucks boycott worked on all levels in every franchise .
They rolled back their stance once profit margin and stocks dropped.
1171 2018-04-02 18:36:16 What type of man. Purposely tries to destroy the economy. Trump sent stocks plummeting today. Like a spoiled child, brat. if he wasn't so mentally ill. I would think he's doing it on purpose.
1172 2018-04-02 18:35:28 Also, "bump stocks" are a non-issue. Most people had never even heard of them before Vegas, and they're not widely used.
1173 2018-04-02 18:35:27 I don’t really think that matters who’s running it. The president doesn’t control the stocks other than their own
1174 2018-04-02 18:35:04 but it is. most ppl are broke bc they have poor spending habits. if you can afford to collect jordan’s, you can afford to invest in stocks.
1175 2018-04-02 18:34:16 Where is the class action lawsuit for Americans who have 401k plans and stocks to which we can sue Donald J trump on the loss of monies in the stock market..

Every time he tweets negatively about a company, he causes a decline in the stock market and losses

1178 2018-04-02 18:33:34 ...listen to Trump @realDonaldTrump over the next day or so. My bet is that he will buy stocks now that he has helped it tank...he will walk it back..
Market will recover...guess who wins.
1179 2018-04-02 18:33:33 . Have you been in stocks yet ?
1180 2018-04-02 18:33:19 Will the stocks go back up..? Asking for a friend..
1181 2018-04-02 18:33:08 Shame on those companies! Because of them, the highly success company I work for is bringing down our stocks. When is Zuckerberg going to jail for the same reason Martha Stewart went to jail???
1182 2018-04-02 18:33:03 If you get anxiety when your stocks are red you my friend are gambling...I get excited cause I know I can increase my position for a discount
1183 2018-04-02 18:32:30 Scan for good stocks on 200ma that had decent earnings last quarter. Look for divergence in RSI and stochastic on 60m that shows slightly on daily.
1184 2018-04-02 18:32:15 So if share buybacks are on your corporate agenda (because you want to consolidate ownership and eventually--or rapidly--go private) a nice pull back in stock price is a good thing, right?

1185 2018-04-02 18:32:11 If the door-doo is really to hit the fan why are the number of stocks above the 50/150/200 all ring now and not making new lows? Inquiring minds wanna know.

1186 2018-04-02 18:32:09 I find it hysterical that whenever trump tweets, American stocks absolutely plummet

1191 2018-04-02 18:29:41 Seems the tech stocks are dragging the markets lower. Sell offs also in part because of China’s tariff retaliations.

1195 2018-04-02 18:29:22 $SPY now back to Feb 9 levels and does not appear to want to hold - flush seems here
$VIX was ~34/35 then and 24 now - either VIX needs to flush UP or SPY new low coming at time when VIX makes a lower high - the latter is bullish stocks

1203 2018-04-02 18:27:45 What stocks has Trump sold off prior to opening his filthy mouth about tariffs and throwing NAFTA under the bus? Making big illegal bucks by manipulating market with his corrupt rhetoric!
1204 2018-04-02 18:27:27 There's a LOT of shit coming out of the WH lately. The stocks are CRASHING (700 pt so far TODAY), Trump doesn't know what the immigration laws even ARE, we're facing WAR on 3 fronts (at least). Stormy's still right here, just waiting her turn.
1205 2018-04-02 18:27:25 Food stocks won’t be affected by the tariffs or tech sell offs. Hence me getting $loco shares and I’m eyeing $boja to see what it does in the next few days
1206 2018-04-02 18:27:21 Everyone is blaming tech. This pullback is broad with the worst performing sector being cons. discretionary. $SPY #stocks #markets
1207 2018-04-02 18:27:13 You’re the 1 responsible for the fall of stocks like Amazon b/c of your tweets. Also, did u know that 3 of the 4 commissioners of the PO that regulate rates r Republicans? So, if you stop tweeting perhaps the stock market will improve or can’t u control yourself? Y must u attack?
1208 2018-04-02 18:26:52 feels like sentiment is more balanced after the moves down in the stocks

1210 2018-04-02 18:26:29 If this is anything like last week, the stocks should recover in the last 90 minutes as vultures buy back in. Then tomorrow will be a gain day until they take their profits with 90 minutes to go.
1211 2018-04-02 18:26:28 Stocks tumble as Trump's tweets rock Amazon again BECAUSE OF CHINA'S TARIFFS AND THE LIAR N CHIEF WANT YOU TO BELIEVE IT'S NOT HIS FAULT
1212 2018-04-02 18:26:24 I guess Trump, or someone who knew what he was about to do (family) could make a lot of money by shorting the market knowing the simple cause-and-effect on stocks of starting trade wars and trashing industries.
1213 2018-04-02 18:26:22 Aaand this is why I don't put my $$ in stocks. Don't listen to the conventional advice telling you to invest in equities. You are being manipulated by Wall Street for their own purposes.

Real estate is the answer. It provides low volatility and fat returns. @theRealKiyosaki
1214 2018-04-02 18:26:20 The Amazing Donald Trump is working tirelessly to lower the price of stocks to a point where even the poorest Americans can afford them.  Such a wise and thoughtful president.  The best president in history! soon you will be able to buy stocks with mere pennies! amazing!
1215 2018-04-02 18:26:12 SINCE DEC.2016 WHEN HE GOT ON TV AND CLAIMED THEY TOOK JOB OVERSEAS BUT THEN ON THAT TIME NOT ONLY DID HIM.RUSSIAN.MAKE MONEY BUT SO DID 2 OTHER GROUP’S 1 FROM JORDAN 1 MIDDLE EAST HAVE FUN USA WHEN ALL  STOCKS CRASH AND YOUR ALL IN THE POOR HOUSE FROM A BAD DEAL MAKER

1220 2018-04-02 18:24:04 thx @JulianMI2 @jessefelder I usually pay little attention to economics. Seldom seems to lead to stock impacts. If 3.5% and 2.5% show up, however, Fed hikes coming and bearish for stocks overall. #BakesTakes_

1222 2018-04-02 18:23:58 BREAKING: Stocks fall sharply as trade tensions mount with China; Dow Jones industrial average sinks more than 600 points.
1223 2018-04-02 18:23:47 Oh there's a necktie. @CNBC if Mr. Beleki thought if stocks go up if earnings go up. Interesting. There was an earning recession and $SPX went up and to the right.
1224 2018-04-02 18:23:47 $AMC $NCMI Both were rallying until the market started bulldozing everything in it's wake. The current value portfolio should hold up in this selloff as prices of these value stocks are cheap and have a margin of safety.
1225 2018-04-02 18:23:44 Stocks will recover starting from wednesday
1226 2018-04-02 18:23:38 the stock market is crashing. like literally all stocks are on the downhill right now
1227 2018-04-02 18:23:25 what the hell going on with my stocks today
1228 2018-04-02 18:23:25 what is behind the constand attack on @amazon & sone other stocks is that it provides OPPORTUNIT for SHORTING and SELF ENRICHMENT for Trump family friends who got info. That is Crony capitalism @KatyTurNBC @AliVelshi I think @FBI should look into all these. I do not have AMZN @AP
1229 2018-04-02 18:23:12 We now have a President deliberately manipulating the stock market, and specific stocks within the market.
1230 2018-04-02 18:23:05 So are those semi auto knives? They selling knives with bump stocks over there? 
1231 2018-04-02 18:23:00 Don't invest into things that you are not competent in. If you don't know stocks, don't just blindly throw money at it. If you don't understand real estate, don't just put your money in there because everyone else is doing it. There's a reason why I haven't bought into Bitcoin.
1232 2018-04-02 18:22:50 Stocks were over priced anyway. Once everything settles it'll bounce back.
1233 2018-04-02 18:22:49 US Stocks sink on Trump’s Tweets!
1234 2018-04-02 18:22:42 If you’re buying this “dip” in the US #stocks, get ready to be #REKT
1235 2018-04-02 18:22:30 Maybe market saying Fed will slow hikes but that isn't a bet I would make. I think they want stocks down a bit.
1236 2018-04-02 18:22:23 Bad day for US stocks today. Europe slightly more protected due to not having any of the FAANG stocks based on their bourses.
1237 2018-04-02 18:22:16 I could really do without @realDonaldTrump ‘s stock market! #TrumpStockMarket #Stocks #StockAlert #TradeWar #Dotard #winning ??? #ImpeachTrump #Cult45 #DumpTrump

1241 2018-04-02 18:21:51 "Stocks plunge as Trump tweets" is a market news article headline I think I would've expected to see more frequently than I actually have. I mean, I'm seeing a version of that right now, but August 2016 me would've expected it to be more frequent an issue with him as President
1242 2018-04-02 18:21:46 FOR ALL OF YOU THAT CAN’T FIGURE OUT WHAT HE IS DOING THE  TRAITOR TRUMP TRASH AND FAMILY + RUSSIAN COMPANIES HAVE BEEN BUYING STOCKS  FROM COMPETING COMPANIES THEN HE ATTACK A COMPANY AND THEN ONCE THE STOCK OF THE COMPANY DIVES THEY BUY IT AND BEEN MAKING MONEY THIS SAME WAY
1243 2018-04-02 18:21:42 I don't know how it can be legal for DJT to make outrageous and inaccurate claims about US publicly traded stocks like Amazon. As a stockholder, I am furious--is there no recourse?
1244 2018-04-02 18:21:34 Seven stocks in the S&P 500 are up today.

1247 2018-04-02 18:20:59 Looks like rotation from stocks to not-stocks. Gold and Bonds are holding up, and index put options are performing well (use options with large open interest and daily volume).

1252 2018-04-02 18:19:38 Usually i would say this is a stretch, but Bernie Sanders has repeatedly stated he supports punitive tariffs against China and his opposition to free trade (which is why stocks are tanking)
1253 2018-04-02 18:19:37 If you recall @realDonaldTrump said multiple times in 2016 "There are #YUGE bubbles everywhere..." backed up #bigly by @Carl_C_Icahn . Next tweet: "I told everyone #stocks was #yuge bubble in 2016" #Obamadidit #blamebush
1254 2018-04-02 18:19:27 Breaking: U.S. stocks fall sharply as trade tensions mount with China. Dow Jones industrial average sinks more than 700 points in midday trading.

1255 2018-04-02 18:19:21 Where's your comment about stocks today? This is when you ACTUALLY affected it by tweeting about Amazon and sparking tariff war with China!
1256 2018-04-02 18:18:39 Hey Melissa.  CNBC.  Don’t you think the market is going down because of the uncertainty of Trump Russia.  Also NKorea and Iran.

1257 2018-04-02 18:18:33 The tech-heavy $NDX, which set a record close just 3 weeks ago, is giving up gains for the year today..

1298 2018-04-02 18:14:20 Agreed. I'm surprised $VIX not closer to 30 or above given the daily moves and amount of stocks dropping dramatically. This would lead me to believe market is not going to "crash". My opinion is subject to change every 10-15 minutes.

1300 2018-04-02 18:14:11 Are we still in a downward fractal cycle with oil? Hope it bounces back up to reenter a short. Today many U.S. and European traders were still in holiday if I'm not mistaken? So maybe we'll see them buy tomorrow before we sweep the rug under them. Stocks could retest 2018 lows.
1301 2018-04-02 18:13:49 I don’t get this love people have for Brazilian stocks. SPX down more than 3% and IBOV down only 1.1% at this moment. This is clearly a sell opportunity for one to go short IBOV via futures market B3! #EmergingMarkets #brazilstocks #sellsellsell
1302 2018-04-02 18:13:35 @officedepot Stick to office supplies. Since you've decided to drop @IngrahamAngle, I've decided to drop you. Note, @Wayfair stock price down today because people like me won't stop at refusing to shop there, also sell our stocks.
1303 2018-04-02 18:13:25 The #DOW is down -693.96 points. It is a buyers market! The reason for the fall is because #China slapped the #USA with 128 new #tarriffs. Follow me!

1304 2018-04-02 18:13:21 .@CNBC Please get someone else to write headlines for you. With $INTC down almost 9%, maybe stop saying that $AMZN leads tech downwards today in your headline about the entire market dropping. Maybe notice that there are stocks that trump doesn't tweet about that move.
1305 2018-04-02 18:13:16 First Winnie Mandela died. Then, I loss a member of my Facebook Group. Now the Stocks went down. #WhatTheHell??? #WhatsGoingOn??? 
1306 2018-04-02 18:13:13 Stocks are getting crushed not a good sign. Positives are economic growth, low interest rates, and earnings coming up
1307 2018-04-02 18:12:10 Stocks are down because we're worried about the economy overheating on one hand, and tariffs causing a recession on the other
1308 2018-04-02 18:12:01 Great job, Trump. Stocks tumble thanks to YOUR FAKE NEWS attacks on Amazon & your idiotic trade war.  Winning bigly, #TrumpChumps #WorstPresidentEver #GOPComplicit #TrumpLies
1309 2018-04-02 18:11:56 I hated Trump for years now, but now, so do my stocks. Trade war? Short the US market. Soros called this a year ago and everyone made fun of him. Plenty more downside if this president clown keeps it up.
1310 2018-04-02 18:11:49 Most of figured that stocks would plummet today following China's announcement of retaliatory tariffs. Just got home from teaching and the DJIA is currently down 700+ points.
1311 2018-04-02 18:11:45 Would you care to back up your claims with any evidence? Stocks dropping? Literally anything other than antedoctal hearsay?
1312 2018-04-02 18:11:13 I suspect @realDonaldTrump is getting his jollies off of the fall of the stock market. Stocks dropping, lies about who is and isn't paying taxes, trade war with China. He's on a power trip, and that is dangerous for our economy.
1313 2018-04-02 18:11:00 Old news. Stocks are down because of trump's tariffs. Roseanne's records disappearing.
1314 2018-04-02 18:10:54 Them gold stocks look real cheap boy.  Committee meetings this month may be next.  Some reallocation to start the new trend.  Lots of time.  Sell FANG first.

1316 2018-04-02 18:10:37 I guess so but like, millions of americans can't afford to dump money into stocks and very little do so through 401Ks. I just think it's the wrong avenue to focus attention on.

1318 2018-04-02 18:09:59 He led people to invest in stocks doomed to fail, or something like that. It was paper crime. You can read about him. The worst part was that people were calling on the govt regulatory agency to investigate him but they didn't act till he had scammed many

1324 2018-04-02 18:09:26 Not true because how mich #GunReformNow happened during the 8 years under obama?   Oh thats right, he gave us bump fire stocks and less gun control that lead to the los Vegas shooting.
1325 2018-04-02 18:09:26 While the common narrative is trade fears, a more honest analysis of the Dow drops would be the fact that stocks are incredibly overvalued based on recent economic data. Get out while you can. More pain is coming.
1326 2018-04-02 18:09:08 With the @Intel news from #Bloomberg adding to the #markets unsettled feeling about #tech -- even though,in this particular case, the impact on the sector as a whole should be largely a net neutral -- the #NASDAQ is now down 3.5%, the S&P 3.2% and the Dow over 700 points. #stocks

1339 2018-04-02 18:06:43 I've always liked the premise of bonds & Roths more than stocks. The potential upside of stocks is great, but unless they're paying dividends so much of their value is maybe.
1340 2018-04-02 18:06:37 It looks like a dream,
1341 2018-04-02 18:06:23 I think the real question today has to be. Is spurring of pushing this Market Panic today? The tech stocks I was really behind this not trade policies or tariffs! Some of you put everything into these and the rest is a rebalancing of the national business model.

1357 2018-04-02 18:04:17 You need to stop this nonsense with these tweets. Either do something if you feel there is a need or quit tweeting about Amazon. You are effecting all the tech stocks when you go after Amazon like this. Thats peoples money and you are not helping anyone here.

1400 2018-04-02 17:57:59 Tariff's, inflation, fed raising rates too fast, or too slow, they dunno, but you must sell everything before losses accelerate into close. Nobody allowed to own any stocks if you want to keep any $. Hide under bunker. Buy $UVXY with all $$
1401 2018-04-02 17:57:55 Without wanting to get too far into the technical details, stocks don't trade at weekends
1402 2018-04-02 17:57:51 Don't got the time or balls to worry about shorting right now. Right now I'm buy and hold in stocks, trading crypto takes all my time. Just decided to sell some AMZN since its +90% since last year
1403 2018-04-02 17:57:38 Guns that are easily turned into machine guns are the particular target and things like bump stocks and high capacity magazines and there are many things that can be changed in a he background check but first stop selling guns at gun shows with zero background check

1405 2018-04-02 17:57:21 Tech stocks in big decline and pushing the rest of the market lower.
1406 2018-04-02 17:56:54 So now it's the turn of Amazon to drop more than 4.9% after Trump accused it of scamming US postal services and using it for e-commerce leading to losses of billions of $$

With the fall in tech stocks, FB, Tesla S&P and Dow are we gearing for another 400-500 pts fall tomorrow??
1407 2018-04-02 17:56:50 Knew this was coming but you'd expect more with stocks down 3%!
1408 2018-04-02 17:56:44 supposedly #tech stocks leading this stock sell-off, but only last week or 2, it was banks, thats why im not necessarily worried too much. @cnbc just said @intel might be down because @apple might not use it as supplier anymore. Intel can easily bounce back, #apple is so fickle.
1409 2018-04-02 17:56:40 Stocks tumble as Trump's tweets rock Amazon again THE LIAR N CHIEF KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT,  AMAZON IS GREAT AND I WILL ALWAYS USE IT,  CHEAPEST PRICES AND THEY PAY THE MOST IN USPS/FEDX/UPS  AND STATE TAXES WHERE APPLICABLE.
1410 2018-04-02 17:56:09 No one is asking for massive gun control. Have you read or seen any of their platform?
Strengthen background checks, no gun show loopholes
Ban assault weapons for civilians
Ban bump stocks

Nothing about banning all guns, but thats what these people hear--or the NRA tells them
1411 2018-04-02 17:55:58 Portfolio taking body blows today lol #stocks
1412 2018-04-02 17:55:48 And yes he is serious. He wants to make bump stocks illegal. A lot of us don't support that. He also said some people should take away guns before due process too. A lot of us don't agree with that either. That last one is unconstitutional.
1413 2018-04-02 17:55:46 There’s no civilian use for assault rifles… high-capacity magazines… armor piercing bullets, bump-stocks… there is no civilian use for any of them… #NRA answer to Everything is “More Guns”… flood the country w/guns… now, they'll tell you that you need one too…
1414 2018-04-02 17:55:14 intel stocks falls
1415 2018-04-02 17:55:09 Also, @realDonaldTrump if we could ban anyone who ever worked for any alphabet agency from OWNING Companies for POWER over USA CITIZENS as well as "AS LONG AS THEY WORK IN A GOVT CAPACITY THEY CANNOT OWN STOCKS!" talk about getting REAL HUMANS4thePoeple in there 
1416 2018-04-02 17:55:05 As I recall this was going to be funded by silicon valley.

With tech stocks dropping like a rock how stable is the funding for this program.

1418 2018-04-02 17:54:30 Yes who is selling stocks short. @FBI
1419 2018-04-02 17:54:19 Market destroyed yet again.  It's becoming increasingly difficult to justify owning US stocks with the leadership that is in place today.
1420 2018-04-02 17:54:06 Bunny thinking about his tech stocks.
1421 2018-04-02 17:53:59 Precisely! And I’ll bet Trump has a money manager somewhere shuffling his stocks.
1422 2018-04-02 17:53:55 They have no money. They have no stocks, bonds, or jobs. All they have is hate.
1423 2018-04-02 17:53:53 The car comparison again ? Keep your cars, make sure you have speed laws, DUI laws and all regulations to make it safe. Just don’t allow formula 1 race cars on the streets. Because that is in fact the real comparison here when we are talking about rifles and bump-stocks..
1424 2018-04-02 17:53:51 @Farhaj Trade and tech are sending the stocks for BIG losses to open the second quarter of 2018 after being up less than a few points on the Dow just before 10 AM ET. Then, all hell broke loose late morning into the afternoon. WalMart another big loser, down 4.5%.

1429 2018-04-02 17:52:57 Should be
1430 2018-04-02 17:52:38 you down this weekend
1431 2018-04-02 17:52:36 Stocks are down because big tech is getting rocked for being liberal idiots.
1432 2018-04-02 17:52:13 If your company has some bad news to release; just do it today. #stocks
1433 2018-04-02 17:52:05 Stocks are selling off. They do that from time to time. An equity selloff is typically followed by hyperbolic headlines which we are seeing today. My favorite so far is "STOCKS' 2Q START IS THE WORST SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION." All caps is always a nice touch.
1434 2018-04-02 17:52:03 The stock market is down by -2.7% (-670 pts). Is that a correction or a mini-crash? Does it really have to do with the rage tweets of @realDonaldTrump or is there something else going on?

1441 2018-04-02 17:51:16 wow $INTC intel shares down 8% on Apple news... another bloody day for tech stocks.
1442 2018-04-02 17:50:56 But if the China based scam collapses because the stocks of the Chinese participants are being shorted in the US then the demand for #vanre, could dry up and burst the bubble. That seems to be implied from the documentary.
1443 2018-04-02 17:50:11 I love when I see the #Stocks and #Bitcoin this low  A smart investor knows that this is the perfect opportunity and perfect time to invest. The lower it goes the higher I see my portfolio growing.  #BuyLowSellHigh
1444 2018-04-02 17:49:57 I bet at this very moment someone in the #Trump organization is purchasing Amazon stock for their investment portfolio.  President tweet Amazon hate, stock goes down … then they buy it. Presidency should not be used to manipulate stocks.
1445 2018-04-02 17:49:56 Stocks are falling sharply on Wall Street, sending the Dow Jones industrial average down more than 600 points, after China raised import duties on U.S. pork, apples and other products. -- @AP
1446 2018-04-02 17:49:42 How nice to send out tweets so stocks get clobbered just in time for ER season for CEO's to announce buy backs of their stock at freshly low prices due to your corp tax cuts
1447 2018-04-02 17:49:40 Maybe Trump will tweet its an April Fools Joke. #tariffs #stocks #Correction

1454 2018-04-02 17:48:58 I don't know how it can be legal for DJT to make outrageous and inaccurate claims about US publicly traded stocks like Amazon. As a stockholder, I am furious that I have no recourse.

1457 2018-04-02 17:48:01 Oh course we can, that's a must with stocks.  Let's just get the time frame correct and not act like it was all figured out last summer. Hindsight analysis and trading is the easiest.
1458 2018-04-02 17:47:55 J'aime bien Asos pour les petites réductions ect mais par contre pour remettre les stocks de tailles ils parlent chinois

1468 2018-04-02 17:45:12 Most major tech stocks at or near one-month lows: e.g. FB, GOOG, AMZN, AAPL, MSFT, NFLX

1498 2018-04-02 17:41:24 You're not going to get that. and that's why the stock never moves. If everyone thought like you and said let me bid.. how would it actually move up? The answer is simple.. it will fall to a no bid. Bid sitting is what causes 99.9% of otc stocks to sink to nothing. Do you though.

1535 2018-04-02 17:35:35 Better to take actions that are definitively ineffective? Really? Ok. Like I said, I don't really care about bump stocks anyway. As far as I know, they have no legitimate necessary use. Ban 'em if you want to. Just don't expect it to change anything real because it won't.

1574 2018-04-02 17:26:30 It's funny how his only tweets about the #stockmarket R when it's up & #trump can "claim" credit. #Hypocritical how, when stocks & job numbers were up under #Obama - when he basically saved the #USEconomy! - he was often discredited as having any role in it.

1588 2018-04-02 17:23:07 There are psychological benefits to having recurring (and growing!) income streams.

And collecting dividends is operationally easier and less subject to bad timing for small investors than selling small portions of numerous stocks every year/quarter/month.

1601 2018-04-02 17:19:21 You gotta love the headlines today: $SPX slide may be fueled partly by traders cutting long bets. AND: Stocks Q2 start is worst since Great Depression.

1608 2018-04-02 17:16:55 @realDonaldTrump Quit Tweeting your lies Mr. PRESIDENT!  Evidently you don't care that hard working people are loosing hard earned money everyday on their retirements, 401k's, stocks, etc.....Quit attacking American company's and lift these tariffs!

1612 2018-04-02 17:15:34 'Trade concerns slam stocks' do you believe that? "CONCERNS" do not lead to THEFT; 'concerns' are a mask for "get the goddamn money before the competition gets it.

1616 2018-04-02 17:14:29 Don't really see the problem with banning bump stocks. It's clearly a product designed to exploit a loop hole.

1618 2018-04-02 17:13:50 At this rate, @realDonaldTrump will completely erase any gains he made during the "Trump Rally" by the end of 2018. He keeps tweeting and stocks keep tumbling. #dowjones

1640 2018-04-02 17:06:57 Hey Ted Lieu is there any way to find out if Trump’s attacks on Amazon are a ploy for him to profit on stocks? If he were to profit in the stock market by his attacks on Amazon would this be a criminal act?
1641 2018-04-02 17:06:52 The majority of your members disagree with your positions on stronger background checks, high capacity magazines, bump stocks, purchasing age, etc., etc., etc.

1669 2018-04-02 17:00:00 But we CAN ban bump stocks and high capacity, easy to change clips. We CAN require ammunition makers to change the ammo so it is not so lethal. Let’s focus on what we CAN do instead of what we cannot.

1671 2018-04-02 16:59:21 Stocks that sell at or below $5 are usually garbage.
1672 2018-04-02 16:58:51 I liked the @JeffreyToobin rebuttal. Selling stocks is legal - selling stock with insider info is not. In both cases it’s the same act.
1673 2018-04-02 16:58:23 the earth shattering headline today that had us discussing was virgil being named creative director & stella mccartney buying stocks lmao

1676 2018-04-02 16:57:35 Leon Stocks is your man Doug, he did the whole lifeguarding thing years ago. I'm sure he can still collect a rubber brick from the bottom of the pool in his pyjamas!
1677 2018-04-02 16:57:32 Trump shoots from the hip as stocks plummet.
1678 2018-04-02 16:57:24 Why news of global trade war recently gave us a great opportunity to buy quality stocks at a deep discount 

India is still largely a domestic story and a very safe bet!

What say you to all this?
1681 2018-04-02 16:56:51 Nice day for Q1 shopping. We loaded lots of stocks and options today. Don’t join the bearish dark side.
1682 2018-04-02 16:56:49 Stocks continue their slide, as DOW slides down 500 and NASDAQ is now down 175.  MBS pull back a bit, now down 5bps.
1683 2018-04-02 16:56:00 Exciting to watch how a tax policy can have such an impact. I'm leaving american stocks. I strongly believe that US will continue down and down as long as this foreign policy is kept in place #AmericaToFailFirst #StocksMarket

1687 2018-04-02 16:55:10 I remember all the liberal commentary when the stock market continues to break record after record!!!!!   Remember MSM?  Stocks don’t matter!  It’s only 401ks which you claim most dont have/care about! #fakenews #stockmarket
1688 2018-04-02 16:55:02 Sometimes I think that these world leaders buy or short sell stocks or index n give positive or negative news accordingly to amass huge fortune .
1689 2018-04-02 16:54:56 @realDonaldTrump You can bet money Trump and his cronies are buying up Amazon stock right now. This was a planned attack to deliberately drive stocks down temporarily. Americans are too stupid to see this is the 3rd time I've noticed it. Go Trump make the Cochs Mercer's Richer
1690 2018-04-02 16:54:49 I just learned that Bed Bath & Beyond stocks TIM TAMS, the best of all biscuit cookies??? I'm stunned, I'm furious, I'm so hungry,
1691 2018-04-02 16:54:35 Dollar slides as China raises tariffs, U.S. stocks slip and falls 500 points after the President slams Amazon. Investors also worry over risk of a trade war with China
1692 2018-04-02 16:54:27 When Trump is gone, stocks will be on sale. Just desperately trying put a positive slant on things. Trump is deplorable!
1693 2018-04-02 16:53:25 Stocks slide into negative territory. Currently down 480 points.
1694 2018-04-02 16:53:17 Only two Dow stocks currently higher on this tough day for Wall Street. $MCD and $UNH. Eat too much of the former and need more coverage from the latter?
1695 2018-04-02 16:52:49 Career ending buzzer beater, like make you lose ALL your draft stocks buzzer beater
1696 2018-04-02 16:52:47 I'm sure political tribalism and ownership of certain stocks influences those who criticize this view though
1697 2018-04-02 16:51:43 $SPY Question is at times like this, are these stocks/markets low enough now to get serious attention from the bulls at these lower levels.
1698 2018-04-02 16:51:21 Semi automatic guns have been around for over 100 years. I was taught to shoot with a semiautomatic pistol at age 8 and got my first .22 semiautomatic rifle at age 10 (1968). Bump stocks get rid of them. They’re a joke, waste of ammo, not accurate. Magazine capacity doesn’t matte
1699 2018-04-02 16:50:50 Stocks quickly shedding some losses.

1703 2018-04-02 16:50:15 actually i shorted  some stocks before that Thursday when he was due to announce the China Tariff.  I think the market does not like it and I may not cover for a while.  Now he has this petty thingy with amzn.  I shorted all FANG stocks.  Crazy me LOL

1707 2018-04-02 16:48:45 Machines programmed to sell stocks like @Amazon when reports of negative news, no matter how idiotic, furthering markets declines, and lowering prices which elites will buy back the stock and it retakes losses, esp when earnings released in the next week. Average citizens hurt.
1708 2018-04-02 16:48:43 Stocks crashing.  Over confidence in Crypto is gone.  Forget the TA, the FA says be wary.

1714 2018-04-02 16:46:41 Plz stop! Your tweets are crashing my amazon stocks!
1715 2018-04-02 16:46:36 LOL. When the stocks go up Fox praises Dear Leader. When market tanks it's an overreaction.
1716 2018-04-02 16:46:06 Serious question.. Recession hits - nobody has money for spending.... No money in stocks or markets, do you think you can sustain mining shitcoins, covering bills and shitposting on Twitter?
1717 2018-04-02 16:45:37 Everytime #POTUS talks economy or bad mouth private businesses stock's tank. There are winners and losers with stocks. Who is making money on the market dropping after #POTUS speaks? @allinwithchris @maddow @AliVelshi @MTP @AriMelber

1722 2018-04-02 16:45:18 @Krylon where can I find spray paint in Saskatoon?? It seems all the retailers who carried Krylon, dont have it anymore......I need someone who stocks it continuously
1723 2018-04-02 16:44:22 Thank you Chioma, I totally agree with you on that. Hearing Twisted always brings back memories from the depth of nostalgia and slowly stocks away the glowing embers of pain in the '90s.

1728 2018-04-02 16:41:49 Also they're charlatans selling stocks with face value of 1 cent.
1729 2018-04-02 16:41:43 I like it as a longer term measure of “cheapness” of stocks...I’m tired of figuring it out manually... oh and it probably doesn’t help me trade..but want it anyway..

1732 2018-04-02 16:40:22 Is it concerning to anyone that Trump is recklessly spewing lies about Amazon, driving down their stock price? Millions of Americans own Amazon stocks in retirement portfolios. Is this what one expects of their president?
1733 2018-04-02 16:39:25 Ben, qu'ils font plus de réimpressions, qu'ils s'occupent pas d'une réédition ou qu'ils en parlent juste plus

1760 2018-04-02 16:32:08 Raise them 25 cents a package right now. In October 25 cents more.  And in January raise 25 cents.  Quit bellyaching, stocks crashing !
1761 2018-04-02 16:31:21 Im thankful that the market is making a correction after the astronomical gains since Trump’s inauguration.  This is literally putting stocks on sale so those of us that understand the markets will be able to get in at a reduced price.
1762 2018-04-02 16:31:21 Hahaha that is definitely an accurate depiction of the office today. Silver lining - market drops provide good buying opportunities. It’s probably al the mayhem wth the tariffs and tech stocks slumping with all the data compromising etc

1768 2018-04-02 16:29:38 You could have made a lot of money betting on the right tech stocks in the last 6 months. Amazon up 44%, Netflix up 60%, Twitter up 65% (!!)
1769 2018-04-02 16:29:33 Pretty big sell off in US stocks.
1770 2018-04-02 16:28:27 You can feel how they are playing this sell off... looking at the account and see HUgE taxable gain on tech stocks, look over at energy HUgE loss... sell energy wait to buy the dip back in tech and financials.... morons

1772 2018-04-02 16:27:54 Amazon is down today, but so are mall stocks and brick & mortar retailer stocks. Markets have more confidence in Trump’s ability to destroy shareholder value at specific firms than his ability to create it.
1773 2018-04-02 16:27:47 The "kings" held up pretty well when the SPY undercut.  momo leaders Stocks like $SQ and $NTNX bounced a bit as well.  Let's see how my breakdown, fakeout NFLX trade goes.  Its up $2. stop to even.
1774 2018-04-02 16:27:16 Then Jeff should do an assessment of his customers to get the answer about staying or leaving. trump isn't going to stop. And the silly man doesn't realize he's not only hurting Amazon, but stocks as a whole.

1780 2018-04-02 16:25:14 Gold is has an extremely flawed pricing model. You Peter, are down on some gold stocks that you bought in 2001. Gold mining is a failed business model under this pricing.
1781 2018-04-02 16:24:44 Looks like stocks trying to take out the bottom of the sideways again. TREND STILL DOWN, FULL HEDGES ON. Be careful everyone. Trying to keep the risk down right now and enjoying the ride doing it!

1787 2018-04-02 16:22:03 U.S. stocks tumbled on Monday, weighed down by #Amazon after U.S. President #DonaldTrump again attacked the online retailer, while the #dollar slid as #China raised tariffs on U.S. products in an escalating spat between the world's two biggest economies.
1788 2018-04-02 16:21:40 Re: that myopic notion of "safety in #biotech stocks" and $$ moving into biotech in '18 to diversify, as M&A catalysts create momentum. Ahhh......no. When markets get slammed and sentiment heads south, risky assets get dumped fast. Nothing has changed in the past 25 years.

1793 2018-04-02 16:21:04 @Papa_Stocks Hey pop, just curious as to why you charge 89$ a year when you, tweet for free, 1st senario, you tell your paying customers in advance what stocks are getting ready to go, but then you tweet when you are ready to sell into the buyers, I have thought about joining

1795 2018-04-02 16:20:43 "That's what I was hoping you'd say!" He seemed to get a little more excited, compared to that humble, noble personality he has.

"So, do you prefer the standard rules? Two stocks, and a flat stage?"
1796 2018-04-02 16:20:35 The air is finally coming out of what could be the biggest U.S. stock market bubble in history. Yet all #CNBC can discuss is why investors should keep buying. Yet #Gold stocks are just now coming off the worst bear market ever, yet no discussion at all about buying those names.
1797 2018-04-02 16:20:06 Stocks and housing markets are where there should be real FUD.
1798 2018-04-02 16:19:58 He hasn't been wrong yet and I'm betting on  the economy even while the stocks tumbling...there are methods to his appeared madness

1801 2018-04-02 16:19:34 No mention of tech stocks..?
1802 2018-04-02 16:19:26 It's about time a president lowered the stockmarket. It's so unfair that people who own stocks make money with their investments. Poor people don't make money so why should people that own stocks. GOOD FOR YOU!
1803 2018-04-02 16:19:12 The stocks will drop a lot more before the weekend.
1804 2018-04-02 16:19:09 Bloodbath at $DOW, $NASDAQ

1806 2018-04-02 16:18:59 Trump derailing stock market rally he loved to falsely claim credit for. 

FANG stocks powered much of the rally:
- FB down due to Cambridge Analytica / Trump campaign
- AMZN due to Trump WaPo attacks + ill-advised trade war

Rising rates due to stimulative deficit spend hurt too
1807 2018-04-02 16:18:56 GDP slipped first time in over a year and growth has slowed to its slowest rate in 7. Big sell off in tech stocks. And of course China...
1808 2018-04-02 16:18:48 I always wanted to learn how to trade stocks but most of the trading sites have a $10k - $25k initial investment. I got into Crypto in Sept of 2017. I've lost some money but I still have a little skin left in the game. What a learning experience this has been
1809 2018-04-02 16:18:22 The top five most active stocks at noon today are $MU, $BAC, $AMD, $GE, and $FB.
1810 2018-04-02 16:18:08 Look at demand figures of North America truck market and auto sales figures for the month of March 18, you also will have positive opinion on these stocks.
1811 2018-04-02 16:18:05 Pistol aur gun lekar danga karne waale log dalit? Such people need protection. Shameful.
1812 2018-04-02 16:18:00 Bought few stocks today and now we have overnight meltdown in global markets!!
1813 2018-04-02 16:17:51 Trade war creeping in ... stocks dive. This is why you stick to your principles of free trade instead of selling out to @realDonaldTrump's fair trade, @marcorubio.
1814 2018-04-02 16:17:30 It’s not the tariffs or a trade war. Overvalued tech stocks lead the decline. This has more to do with older economic policies.
1815 2018-04-02 16:17:21 @realDonaldTrump  let's watch the stocks tank because we have an idiot who lies in the white house.  Funny how you don't brag about how great it is that the stocks lose worth during your tenure.
1816 2018-04-02 16:17:05 Wow. I posted yesterday regarding *Plastic Jesus sales are off this year* and "considered" offing my Plastic Jesus stocks. I had no idea it would affect the market that much today. Whew!
1817 2018-04-02 16:16:53 It's time to observe & reason how the QE money went straight into the market instead of lending to spurn economic activity, particularly the FANG stocks & others, which is why all growth was a mirage. It's not about tariffs. It's about the punchbowl & unleashing inflation. #MAGA

1821 2018-04-02 16:16:24 If China continues to retaliate by imposing higher taxes on agra products don't forget to short Trucking and Rail stocks. They'll also be a big loser ....
1822 2018-04-02 16:15:57 why why why why why? What does trade war have to do with tech stocks?
1823 2018-04-02 16:15:04 This is the best market for new traders to build their foundation. Everyone wants to buy stocks in a bull market no doubt , if you establish your foundation you can prosper any environment as long as you don’t deviate from your process
1824 2018-04-02 16:14:46 It’s 2018 Don, brick and mortar stores are dead!  Stop #pickingwinnersandlosers and meddling with the markets!  With your idiotic tariffs and your personal issue with Jeff Bezos, you are messing up my 401k!  Stocks are tumbling because of you! #notariffs
1825 2018-04-02 16:14:44 U.S. stocks - off their first losing quarter in more than two years - are down sharply today as 2q begins. S&P, Dow both off about 2.5%
1826 2018-04-02 16:14:39 This is garbage from ABC. Tech stocks are leading the rout not pork producers
1827 2018-04-02 16:14:12 LOL, Im only down on cybx. So, look when I recommended buying those! Penny stocks, lol. Keep up rookie! Made more today then you will in 5yrs. #bayliever
1828 2018-04-02 16:13:29 Nice. Fn suretrader put SLS on 1:1 like it does all the good stocks of the day and I got stuck watching my mental entries. Smh 
1829 2018-04-02 16:13:10 @HalftimeReport once again the show is trashing the market rather than point out good stocks and blames Trump
1830 2018-04-02 16:13:08 even my gold stocks ?
1831 2018-04-02 16:12:47 The concern is real. What if the BATF & DOJ decides to "appropriate" all financial transactions regarding sale of bump stocks so as to send officers to the 600,000 persons who bought them, if/when they become illegal?
1832 2018-04-02 16:12:35 Well, money leaving stocks, but not buying bonds or yen. Not 100% de-risk move today.
1833 2018-04-02 16:12:34 Dear President #Trump: I'm sick of losing. See my stocks today, for example. Please resign, and I'll feel a lot better.

1837 2018-04-02 16:11:27   Orange Face Clown using his Office to TARGET specific stocks like AMAZON. I believe this to be an impeachable offense.  China issues 128 tariffs back on the US in retaliation to #ManBaby's tarriffs.
1838 2018-04-02 16:11:22 Stocks crushed.   Mommy
1839 2018-04-02 16:11:20 Stock market has been propped up by IRAs, 401Ks and Low, close to Zero, interest rates.

Fed announces it is raising rates, stocks stumble.
1840 2018-04-02 16:11:04 Andy Brenner's summation of the selloff is succinct to start: "Too many tweets... whether it Amazon, Tesla, FB or others..."  #stocks
1841 2018-04-02 16:11:02 Since the president's stocks are not in a true blind trust can't he be guilty of stock manipulation by his statements on Amazon and others
1842 2018-04-02 16:11:02 What if all this "Attacking," $AMZN & $FB simply forces people to diversify some, so the MKt doesn't just track those stocks? @terranovajoe @stephenLweiss @kevinolearytv @ScottWapnerCNBC
1843 2018-04-02 16:10:58 .@TheDomino: When #POTUS targets individual companies, traders and investors have to keep an ear and eye out on what he's going to say. Trump and his admin have championed stocks as [gauge] of their success, so it remains to be seen what they're going to say. #AMR
1844 2018-04-02 16:10:26 Someone find me anyone that got the 15 bucks though? They aren’t getting anything from him and when they say the economy is great my question is what stocks do you own, none. So yes it’s racism and bigotry, the two things he’s actually good at.
1845 2018-04-02 16:10:25 I think there is a good chance crypto and especially bitcoin could be the gateway and safe haven if stocks and bonds crash! In case of a property crash it would even be better!! #btc to the moon
1846 2018-04-02 16:08:40 Messed up my stocks this morning and now I’m missing out on all these gains smh. Just a reminder not to second guess myself
1847 2018-04-02 16:08:40 Good time to pick up more stocks. It's gonna go back up tomorrow.
1848 2018-04-02 16:08:30 Hmmm...wonder how Suckerberg knew to sell off $500 Million shares of FB stock right before FB stocks took a nosedive? Anyone else smell insider trading?

1851 2018-04-02 16:08:06 .@TheDomino: Trump has been very critical of Amazon and Amazon is a very large part of the US market...it's important to point out that it's in no way a panic type of move - but big names (larger name technology stocks) are being closely watched. #AMR

1854 2018-04-02 16:07:43 Down tumbles over 500+ points thanks to trump's fumbling in trade. Major stocks are pulling back and fear is that it may continue.
1855 2018-04-02 16:07:28 Stocks plummet as you threaten and start trade wars with everyone! Please stop ranting, especially about things you don’t understand and always simplify because you are simpleminded
1856 2018-04-02 16:07:03 pull out to what? if bonds, stocks and fiat currencies are dropping in value it is hard to find a place where you actually gain value in your position. silver, gold and crypto is the few that likely work imho

1863 2018-04-02 16:05:34 Interesting you started this analysis in October of 2011. August 2011 was the S&P downgrade of the US credit rating and all stocks fell off a cliff.

1924 2018-04-02 15:57:35 While cheap stocks do tend to have lower expectations than expensive ones, two mistakes can arise. First is buying a statistically cheap stock that deserves to be even cheaper. That’s a value trap. Second is shunning a statistically expensive stock that represents a good value.

1941 2018-04-02 15:53:28 @larry_kudlow As the Fed raises interest rates all those governments, Wall Street and others who were buying cheap stocks with free money on margin have to sell in order to meet their obligations.

2000 2018-04-02 15:45:41 UPDATE: U.S. stocks extend fall; Dow down 2 percent, Nasdaq falls 3 percent
2001 2018-04-02 15:44:51 I think its because of the volume piece. U would need in realtime  volume of all advancing stocks and ditto for declining. But again in all fairness this is more of a slow moving indicator. Not sure intraday would add any more value than eod. Intraday a mclellan osc is ok imo
2002 2018-04-02 15:44:26 The offering, the delay in a bad ER report. Those two just to keep It simple. Keep in mind, it’s not exactly a huge loss. I was Long from $43ish. I lost a huge profit, plus a small bit of principal. For me, investing isn’t only about stocks. $ostk has changed
2003 2018-04-02 15:44:23 So all the money you gave away to the corporations with your #TaxScam, as predicted, didn't go to jobs and workers paychecks.  Instead it went directly into CEO's pockets as they cashed in their stocks and then had their corporations claim bankruptcy.

2021 2018-04-02 15:39:25 REMINDER: A savings account yields 1.5% a year, so when trading stocks you better be making WAY more than that.

2027 2018-04-02 15:37:17 I will make this suggestion, that the mom and pop shops begin their venture into the tech industry and you ask Amazon to then help them with this free of charge for the first two years as a favour to promote small business. Stocks go up everyone wins.

2029 2018-04-02 15:36:14 Always remember that the greatest power in finance is compound interest!
All the dividends you get if you were to reinvest them in other dividends paying stocks it will increase the overall value of your portfolio and you'll be getting back more dividends every time you reinvest.

2079 2018-04-02 15:25:31 Over 75% of all stocks in the market down today. Not looking good
2080 2018-04-02 15:25:13 The biggest reveal in the next 25 years will be that Trump manipulated financial markets.  Talking crap about Amazon over a tweet has put a lot of downward pressure today for stocks. Creating a ton of trade tariffs without proper consultation is wreaking havoc in the PMI data.

2098 2018-04-02 15:19:11 In the meantime, continue to keep track of which leaders are exhibiting the most strength. These stocks will tend to be the first ones to breakout when the major indexes begin a new, sustainable uptrend.

2100 2018-04-02 15:18:51 Once the market follows through, it’s time to begin establishing long positions in leading growth stocks, as they break out of constructive bases on heavy volume. Exposure should only be increased if progress is being made.

2103 2018-04-02 15:18:16 Honestly... I hate stocks sometimes.  Saw a thing where a stock I was invested in was getting sued, I cashed out and it went up 17 cents a share  it’s fine, I wanted to screw myself out of 343 bucks

2109 2018-04-02 15:15:16 "the doping was his own illegal business," - which pretty much goes to show Russia has little/no control over what should be national programmes. Entirely possible they has no control over their chemical stocks???
2110 2018-04-02 15:15:05 that's not entirely true.  You however rolled back stricter gun control regulations that Obama did impliment.  Bump stocks as far as I am aware were never illegal.  The law from 95 to 2014 only limited the amount of mods you could have installed at the same time.

2118 2018-04-02 15:12:38 @realDonaldTrump Stocks could continue to struggle if the trade fight between President Trump and China goes from what is now a tit-for-tat tariff squabble to a full-blown economic war, as that could imperil the global economic recovery.

2146 2018-04-02 15:03:26 Always good to recognize time and goals. Data mining can be spun in many ways to deter or inspire. So if goal is long term, 30+ years (which most are) then convince yourself the 30 yr rolling avg is most relevant. Long term stocks are less volatile than bonds.

2180 2018-04-02 14:52:33 Volatility just means price movements, so stocks were no more "volatile" when the dropped 10% in Q1 than when they surged 10% between Q3 and Q4 of 2017.

2352 2018-04-02 14:02:35 Really? I find them terrifying; stocks of things you're sure ceased production in the 70s, things with no price tag (or 2+ contradictory ones), the random layout, the way every area is too hot or too cold, and the conversations…

2387 2018-04-02 13:43:50 They make residual income which means they do the work one time and get paid over and over again. Real estate, stocks, network marketing, cryptocurrencies, parking lots, vending machines, laundromats, books and albums are just a few sources of residual income.
2388 2018-04-02 13:43:46 relatively speaking, you just don't speak to them. period.
then they just fade off into trumpworld and busy themselves debating Fox TV, libs, who Hillary killed or the stocks they're going to invest in...'someday'.

2428 2018-04-02 13:24:29 Assets go up over the long run (stocks, etc). Now that ppl no longer work for same company 40 years, mobility is important.

2471 2018-04-02 12:59:57 Obama's economy was a steady and sustainable growth for all. Trumps sharp rise is due to corp benefits but, as proven 10x over, fails horribly when the working class runs out of money. Don't believe it? Go buy stocks...please.
2472 2018-04-02 12:57:42 Businesses have been making record profits. And they have been taking that money and instead of raising their workers wages they have been passing that profit on to their executives in the form of stocks. As the average Americans wages have remained virtually flat for 20 years.

2501 2018-04-02 12:38:06 The stock is today weighed down because of the input price has gone up, what investors are waiting on is that the output price increases.

2726 2018-04-02 09:29:23 Rarely a chart shows Gaps on Daily/Weekly/Monthly charts. There are at least 2 stocks that are exhibiting this today
2727 2018-04-02 09:28:14 When you look at a chart, ask yourself:

1. Where has price been?
2. Where is it likely to go?
3. What’s the risk if you’re wrong?
4. What’s the reward if you’re right?

Look left to plan right.

No appt on offer for session today. Told l could 'drop in' but might be turned away. Not a risk I'm willing to take given how Ltd my time is.

New system is surely limiting stocks. If you want to increase efficiency - study the sessions, lots of opportunities.

2732 2018-04-02 09:23:12 There are always catalysts ‘excuses’ for reversion from extreme conditions. Unweighted FAANNG basket was at 30% premium to its sharply ascending 200dma early Feb. even these stocks can’t sustain that.

2744 2018-04-02 09:15:58 No one is talking about banning all guns. Just assault rifles that no one really needs unless your law enforcement. Banning bump stocks and high capacity magazines. Mandatory background checks to stop the sale of guns to criminals or mentally unstable.

2748 2018-04-02 09:12:23 It's not taking the rights away from people by banning bump stocks or high capacity magazines. The NRA wants people to believe that the kids want to ban all weapons, but they don't. We just want common sense laws, like no one wants to ban cars because of drunk drivers.

Are the stocks owned by that fund, public information?

2833 2018-04-02 07:29:13 Much of what you say is sensible.

2835 2018-04-02 07:24:00 Personally if I’m in these stocks for the long haul then it better be companies that can acquire others or supply them. There will be tight competition eventually and maybe cigarette companies will jump in soon.

2939 2018-04-02 05:23:38 I think high quality stocks fall very less when compared to low quality,when market recovers from fall we can see that high quality stocks recover fast, but first time investor should stick to high quality stocks to protect his capital,later he can buy mid & small cap in declines

2941 2018-04-02 05:22:24 There is a lot of evidence that market timing doesn't yield superior results. When you buy stocks on someone's conviction, when that someone sells the stock, your only reason for buying it goes out of the window. Also, you will be among the last ones to know about the sale.

2996 2018-04-02 04:22:02 Qn: Is there anything specific which needs to be check at the retracement level to ensure that it will happen and not fall further (CCI34-30m >0 + CCI34 5 mins <-175 + CCI8 5mins <-175). Retracement didn't happen in all the stocks in the list.
2997 2018-04-02 04:19:32 Ahh, so the truth does not matter. Gotcha.  Bless your heart.  See the problem is that evil people and a corrupt system (obama holdovers in control) fired the weapon. Assault rifles are already illegal. Bump stocks were okayed by Obama. Yes, change needs to occur but leave my 2A
2998 2018-04-02 04:17:42 sir, you should allow poor traders like me for free?
2999 2018-04-02 04:15:16 ...because you don't raise taxes even in the middle of a recession. You have no concept of nuance -- tax cuts as policy have some grounding, but cutting taxes at boom times where stocks and assets are already overvalued to spur investment and you need to pay back bonds is silly.
3000 2018-04-02 04:14:51 But it’s a different market these days. When they left stocks they went to cryptos before gold or bonds. This is a weird market. I think we go back to 26,000 on the Dow because the other choices basically suck

Things to watch this week is to see if DXY (the dollar) will reverse it's downtrend and head back up causing gold and oil to fall (for sure gold down)

Also keep your eye on VIX.  If it stays above 18 while stocks rally,

3116 2018-04-02 02:38:07 Do you understand that situation doesn't exist?

Obama didn't take away your guns, unless you had been recently released from the hospital for the criminally insane. He never put forward ANY legislation end guns.

Stopping issuing bump stocks is not "taking away your guns".

3135 2018-04-02 02:16:16 Mr President, then why are you treading on our our constitution and 2nd Amendment right by banning bump stocks? Funny how nothing got banned when President Obama was acting President and he was a democratic and your a Republican??

3137 2018-04-02 02:14:33 A quick tip on how to follow the markets:

"Definitely is not safe to try to keep account of too many stocks at one time. You will become entangled and confused." 
– Jesse Livermore, speculator (1877-1940)
3138 2018-04-02 02:13:27 He was talking about the killing his rich friends would make by shorting American stocks. (I think that's what it's called.)
3139 2018-04-02 02:13:17 You’ll be just fine. Finance is prob personal finance and its not bad . It’s like memorizing ratios and simple balance sheet/ IS .. then stocks and bonds . Your classes are fine to take all together . Int 1 kinda rough . Cost to me is easy. Fed tax hard . Finance medium

3142 2018-04-02 02:10:59 Again, that backs MY statement. Not yours. Having the ATF reclassify as NFA is tantamount to a ban from most civilians.  Nowhere does it state that “bump stocks are necessary”. Thanks for proving my point. :)
3143 2018-04-02 02:10:12 How about we fix what's in place for background checks first, then re-examine if needed?  I hate creating redundant laws/systems.  I couldn't care less about bump stocks.  I can do the same thing with a piece of elastic if I want to.
3144 2018-04-02 02:09:40 Congrats! Walmarts Equate generic aspirin stocks will be soaring! You backed the wrong donkey @BayerUS .Mother Inlaw used your diabetic monitor and strips. She tossed it all today and bought a One Touch. #BoycottBayer #BlockBayer
3145 2018-04-02 02:09:24 My source is in the same article. Did you even read it?? Lololol.  It backs my statement. But nowhere does it state that the NRA “insisted bump stocks were necessary”.
3146 2018-04-02 02:08:03 I bet Trump gets a profit somehow/somewhere. Stocks or profits up front perhaps. Something is not right. His products are made in China.
3147 2018-04-02 02:07:43 I was totally gonna vote for you until you said death penalty. How about being back the stocks?
3148 2018-04-02 02:06:36 It does a lot. Just like a CEO owning stocks of his company, shows that he is cofident and believe on the work. Besides, he has a motive to continue pushing things forward. Sell a few as he needed, would be understandable, but get rid of all at the perfect timing is suspicious.

3171 2018-04-02 01:41:57 Have we gotten to the part where Jesus tells his disciples to arrest and deport immigrants and then tells them bump-stocks are their divine right?  #JesusChristSuperstarLive
3172 2018-04-02 01:41:27 That's exactly it. They're unreasonable in their fear. They fear what it looks like with no understanding of it's function. One squeeze of the trigger, one round is discharged. If they want to fill their diapers over bump-stocks, they can thank Obama's DOJ for approving them.

There is no “they.” Your conspiratorial remarks inflame divisiveness.
WE are regular people. Americans killed by AR15s, bump stocks, high capacity mags, limited background checks all bleed red. This is not about right or left
This is about Public Safety
3200 2018-04-02 01:07:08 None of them have mentioned anything about repealing the 2nd  amendment. Strengthening background checks, banning bump stocks, limiting high capacity magazines, raising the age limit to 21 to buy certain guns. Not a single one of those things infringes on yours or my rights.

3203 2018-04-02 01:05:57 Yes I get it you think they targeted gun free zones. So again why give them easy access to weapons, magazines, bump stocks and unlimited ammo. You are then always on the defense! Why not prevent?

Universal background checks

3211 2018-04-02 00:58:45 1.) It's really our fault, in retrospect in a number of instances. Say I'm harping on, fine, but this really comes down to a lack of us continually checking up in-person on Afghan stocks of these items on a quarterly and surprise basis. This is the fourth or fifth most corrupt

3217 2018-04-02 00:50:17 Big time investors bought in to gold a year or two ago as we are 10 years since the last recession and already the charts are breaking records which means we are currently at levels never seen before which usually only means one thing  more records or prepare for stocks to crash

3227 2018-04-02 00:41:22 Randy - Educate yourself on the Tiahrt Amendment, repeal it. Study gun trace data, and shut down avenues where legal guns get into criminals' hands.
Also, ban bump stocks & high capacity mags, expand background checks to private sales, raise age to 21, and ban ARs
3228 2018-04-02 00:41:17 How is my tweet the dumbest of the day when I pointed out ur actual selling price will be under $400 once u take out federal & state taxes owed. I am being the honest one. U are the one who said, "For everyone who offered me sub 500 for Sean Wotherspoon...I hope u die in a ditch"
3229 2018-04-02 00:40:30 A bit like shares etc if a share bought for pennies etc does well and its viable to do so eg minus fees etc and still make a profit etc i would take the profit out of that share and reinvest it in a variety of different stocks and those new stocks are effectively free shares
3230 2018-04-02 00:39:57 I be sitting in the bar looking at stocks
3231 2018-04-02 00:38:39 Still grateful tho. Tho it wasnt perfect, I was able to work on some mixes, stocks and workouts were great. Got to improve myself each day.
3232 2018-04-02 00:38:22 Thanks Ryan.  I appreciate it man.  Like I mentioned earlier, if the goal was the pump stocks, I'd pick tiny floats and make shit up about them haha.

Get her to tell you what stocks to buy!
3235 2018-04-02 00:35:59 Third is the best-I recommend looking up some good hockey arena stocks to blur and make the background bc a player just sitting against a brick wall doesn’t look as ornate. And the white glow stands out a little try feathering the edge but def an improvement from the last
3236 2018-04-02 00:33:40 Will Netflix stocks tank now?.. Yup...
3237 2018-04-02 00:33:02 mWhat if the "printed" dollars do NOT flow into stocks?   Hey, I know nothing, but trying to see all angles.  Just because the fed wants higher stock prices does NOT make it so; or perhaps, stocks do go up, but in some type of dystopian hyperinflation?
3238 2018-04-02 00:31:51 Hey, I thought it belonged to us down here in Spain...oh well, let's face it, too many laughing stocks of lately  #LaughingStocksGalore

3242 2018-04-02 00:27:56 lost 1.5 trillion by stealing from the poor to give to the rich that used it on themselves! Refused to lower the debt and so added 1.5 trillion and then lost  near a trillion in the stocks and even now attack kids and promotes hate in church on Easter and lies about Amazon taxes

3244 2018-04-02 00:26:29 It's been six months since the Las Vegas Massacre and bump stocks are still legal. @SenDeanHeller @CatherineForNV @RosenforNevada @RubenKihuen @MarkAmodeiNV2
3245 2018-04-02 00:26:23 So you put the 2nd amendment at risk by wanting to ban bump stocks and wanting to raise the age to purchase a rifle to 21 but then blame the liberals for attacking the 2nd amendment so republicans can win in 2018...you haven’t done one good thing for the 2A,  you’re turncoat!
3246 2018-04-02 00:24:44 but this retrenchment is a beard

3248 2018-04-02 00:23:25 Personally I couldn’t care less about bump stocks. The same thing can be done with a belt loop.
3249 2018-04-02 00:22:21 um . .  youn think bump stocks should be legal? Why? what purpose do they serve that outweighs risks like Vegas?
3250 2018-04-02 00:20:41 I know right, I can’t any store in Ireland or UK that stocks The Infinity Gauntlet, I’m not willing to be paying the import charges to get one from America.
3251 2018-04-02 00:20:22 Stocks to watch this week, $mspc is about to become current and $libe has closed so many deals at the end of last week. Look it up.

3255 2018-04-02 00:15:07 yeah they only have been talking about it for a long time and they actually supported a bill that would put some form of regulation on bump stocks also but guess what people have bumpfired guns before the stock was made it does more damage to the gun then firing it normal
3256 2018-04-02 00:14:04 @elonmusk ayy careful you don’t want your stocks to go fuckin nuclear
3257 2018-04-02 00:13:19 #craigofthecreek is the show that these young kids need! It’s adventurous, it shows a productive black family full of knowledge & goals. They eat dinner together, the old brother is in honors classes, the little girl is into stocks and such...ugh  here for it all! 
3258 2018-04-02 00:12:38 131). There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks.
3259 2018-04-02 00:10:40 Because stocks increased again?
3260 2018-04-02 00:09:37 The only thing I use from GFX packs or in the form of a stock is particles. I use to depend on them too much when I first started. But my quality has went up when it’s just not overlayed stocks over each other.
3261 2018-04-02 00:09:25 I talked to Dadpool right after and he wasn't upset or salty at all. He just told me "down 2 stocks no jump, air dodge, not on his main. GG"

3264 2018-04-02 00:04:19 But the wonder is still "experts" are claiming that Indian stocks are over valued compared to others!!!
3265 2018-04-02 00:03:38 My favorite type of stocks
3266 2018-04-02 00:03:03 Agree. I think once more mainnets and adoption occurs we will see a change.

Everyone who traded triple 0 penny stocks are now in crypto now. Love those over bloated structures.

Makes sense to get 10k of a coin at .04 100 bil supply than 100 of something at $4. 100 mil supply
