127 2019-05-15 22:59:55 My stock broker was worried about my investment in trampoline stocks, but I told him that, despite their ups and downs, they always bounce back  #dadjokes

131 2019-05-15 22:55:34 Banning plastic straws feels like banning bump stocks in my book.

Feels good, doesn’t address the issue.
132 2019-05-15 22:54:40 And Draw and Quartering, the Stocks and public hangings - why stop. Oh, wait, that would likely mean that men would be harshly punished more than women (if history is right). The U.S. has gone mad.  The Gov of Alabama should be ashamed of herself.
133 2019-05-15 22:54:32 Later converse.  Enjoy some cookies as your stocks drop.
134 2019-05-15 22:53:03 What percentage of stocks can a public company buy back before the company is considered private? 
Like, if a company owns 51% of their own stock,  are they really public?
135 2019-05-15 22:53:01 @QTRResearch @RealPhilIvory so Chris Irons (@QTRResearch) bought $ostk in the 60's and pumped it to his podcast listeners. Epic fail.  He also is bearish on stocks and hates Bitcoin. More fail!
136 2019-05-15 22:52:17 Who got some stocks they wanna trade for some 24 forces 
137 2019-05-15 22:50:49 There’s a lot of factors influencing rise and fall of stocks value... we can guess but nothing is sure, so maybe we should drop it
138 2019-05-15 22:50:10 in fact I would love!! I've asked for it from Amazon but apparently they do not have stocks
139 2019-05-15 22:49:56 The optionality on this is to rent a 3.5M home for the same payment and invest the 200k in Canandin Bank stocks.The stocks pay dividends, the house requires maintenance and increasing property taxes. Hmmmmm
140 2019-05-15 22:48:24 Dawg when I tell you, I went to work like nobody better not talk to me  & Robinhood is a good app but that's more for stocks & crypto currency not Forex
141 2019-05-15 22:48:24 Desde ayer ya era imposible conseguir nada vía internet. Todo lo que se podía hacer era hoy o cuando se pueda, si reponen, ir a tiendas físicas a preguntar, ya que tenían stocks separados. Imagino que harán más unidades. Todo esto ha sido un tanteo, estoy seguro.
142 2019-05-15 22:48:21 I agree, I sold all my legacy stocks lol :)))

145 2019-05-15 22:45:55 Don’t even think begging on bended knee will be enough, I think it will require time in the stocks as well. The Tories nor Labour shouldn’t ever be let near the levers of power again.
146 2019-05-15 22:44:25 Rebels can afford to use TOW missiles vs trucks, then must be confident in an upcoming supply or stocks of TOWs.

152 2019-05-15 22:39:03 Seriously, what’s inside her head. How the hell she managed to come out with that statement. “The stocks rise due to Seungri’s rejected arrest warrant”. It’s so dumb and it’s the most funny statement of the year for me. Lol
153 2019-05-15 22:37:50 stocks said: STOP SLEEPING ON WINNER
154 2019-05-15 22:35:27 First off, there will be growing pains. The idea is to make US manufacturers competitive. I am not sure why democrats are so afraid to ruffle feathers. Second, no my stocks, my 401 are all doing great! And I have more money in my pocket.

We MUST AND WILL have universal background checks, outlaw bump stocks & ban military assault weapons. Also why I think we should low…
159 2019-05-15 22:33:28 BUY STOCKS.
160 2019-05-15 22:32:47 Sure. Of course, my hatred for @POTUS is because he's a twatwaffle with terrible polices that are going to end up destroying us all. They do the exact opposite of making us great or a world leader and instead now Germany an China are taking that over and we're laughing stocks.
161 2019-05-15 22:32:39 Condom stocks should go up
162 2019-05-15 22:32:38 3M right now and invest it in a diversified portfolio of stocks, real estate, and startups. Then live off the money I make in my current business.
163 2019-05-15 22:32:38 Plenty of stocks out there that haven’t given a damn $PEP for one doesn’t
164 2019-05-15 22:32:34 We know what can be done, but getting the action is the problem, nobody wants to commit as it means change and money being spent, big assets get devalued and such stocks and flows into value forming change dramatically.
165 2019-05-15 22:32:16 imagine being So delusional that u think yg stocks went  bc of s*ung*i what the fuck. winner sweetie i'm so sorry
166 2019-05-15 22:31:10 The over saturation in the monetization of pussy means it’s best time to buy, stocks at an all time low

176 2019-05-15 22:27:29 But that’s the entirety of the bullish thesis!

“I know it’s wrong but it feels so good” argument!

Poster Child of Guilty Pleasures:
BOJ

Zero yield on the Japanese government bond gives them free will to buy unlimited assets+print unlimited yen. So they sell bonds/buy stocks.
177 2019-05-15 22:27:26 Lol. It’s funny that one particular VIP said that YG’s stocks rose due to Seungri’s rejected arrest warrant. You are so delusional.
178 2019-05-15 22:26:49 Are you being super efficient or avoiding something else? My own spreadsheet habit runs to one of those two extremes. It’s possible to get a LOT of info about stocks while avoiding revisions.
179 2019-05-15 22:26:41 I wonder. If Trump's company went public, what would it be worth? I'm thinking junk bonds and penny stocks. But who knows.

183 2019-05-15 22:22:56 This is a good thing, but trying selling a #uranium etf to retail atm. Noboy cares.  Look at URA bleeding assets.  When uranium gets hot, retail and funds will use it as a vehicle. It can get some decent AUM and chase the U stocks.
184 2019-05-15 22:20:41 Er, no.. I didn’t say or infer that. As they write in the article, “an outbreak of African swine fever in China has hit demand for soy, largely used for animal feed. An easing of tensions in early 2019 also led the United States to send some of its soybean stocks to China” 
185 2019-05-15 22:20:22 We are on a month by month lease so whenever we wanna move my problem right now is I’m trying to sell my stocks for credit card pay off money so I can finally start saving money for moving lol after moving like 6 times in the past 7 years I wanna make sure I have a

190 2019-05-15 22:18:42 Either way I’d be appreciative, but I’d tell him take the car back and go get me two stocks in a business... which will be half of the price of the car.

192 2019-05-15 22:15:08 Money management is about finding the trade-off between taking so much risk that you end up losing everything or are forced to quit trading and taking so little risk that you end up leaving too much money on the table. #theartoftrading101 #forex #stocks #crypto
193 2019-05-15 22:14:35 Bitcoin has a limited emission, unlike gold.  And the reality of Bitcoin stocks can be traced;  and gold is not.  If bitcoin is gold, then it is Securypto that will become a minimum of platinum.  #securypto #crypto #cryptocurrency #bitcoin #bitcoins #altcoin #btc
194 2019-05-15 22:14:34 Wood stocks is too low my league
195 2019-05-15 22:14:32 Keep in mind, some state definitions might be more strict. For example, California measures stocks in the folded position or shortest length (for telescoping stocks), and applies that to their own definitions. So you could be violating state law even if you're okay on federal.

Anyhoo,the bad news is due to the aforementioned froopiness, I have to eat half a romantica right now.

205 2019-05-15 22:10:41 Overall length is measured with the stocks in the open or longest usable position. Barrel length excludes any muzzle device that's easily removable.
206 2019-05-15 22:10:09 Unfortunately, not at this time. We support NASDAQ, NYSE, AMEX and OTC stocks/ETFs, Forex and Crypto. Futures is on the horizon at some point, though, but no timeframe.
207 2019-05-15 22:09:54 3) And, yes ban military style weapons/ammunition/bump stocks/3d image of weapons. No private citizen needs any of these. Close all loopholes in current laws.
208 2019-05-15 22:09:29 Any civilian style weapon modeled after the military style m16 and its kind. But we also need to ban all bump stocks, high capacity magazines, armor piercing bullets and high velocity bullets. That’s should do it.
209 2019-05-15 22:09:13 $4000. Live like I’m broke for 1 year, take the 75-85% of the money I was able to hold onto that year, and diversify. Start a new business, invest in growth stock mutual funds and select single stocks I believe in..etc. etc. The 3 Mil would comparably be just a fraction over time
210 2019-05-15 22:08:37 i see :) i would want to invest Us stocks, but the issue is i dont live in Us. :) the brokage firms have high comissions and fees etc. So i was looking forward to seeing abra :)

Good luck :)
211 2019-05-15 22:08:25 This is cyber panhandling she dosnt need to get on your channel because you are irrelevant. Leave her alone and let her live bro. Just keep selling flash cards bro and invest in Mcdondalds stocks that's all you have to do and you will be rich 1 day.
212 2019-05-15 22:08:06 There is not a single statistic of the past decade where Wisconsin is better than MSU. So you acting like MSU is “hanging on to 2000,” when Wisconsin hasn’t won a natty in the past half century is ridiculous since they lead in no other category either.

220 2019-05-15 22:02:02 I don't watch TV I hear complaint from Puerto Rico that has not been helped or Chicago or better yet how the stocks look at the moment. The problems he creates then trys to fix them so you can give him credit is not a true leader.
221 2019-05-15 22:01:57 Oil producers use fear, uncertainty and doubt(FUD) when they sell oil,  about every other supplier other than themselves.  FUD probably accounts  for 20-30% of the price of oil at any given month.  The fact is OECD  stocks GREW 22.8mb in the last month. #OOTT
222 2019-05-15 22:01:23 That is hard to believe. Must just be the individual stocks printing $$
223 2019-05-15 22:01:14 Investing in growth stocks is the real time arbitrage
224 2019-05-15 22:01:07 “It means the release and cultivation of the better racial elements in our society, and the gradual suppression, elimination and eventual extirpation of defective stocks — those human weeds...”  So this statement is better because it doesn’t mention WHICH race?  Still a RACIST!!!
225 2019-05-15 22:00:00 Stocks up 115 today.  Looks like markets are absorbing the China Trade Negotiations well.  To hear the "experts" the other day, you'd think we were going to lose 10.000 points!

227 2019-05-15 21:58:56 1) I feel a major challenge in the DRC is the inability to acquire wealth.  If, say, you do well in trade in the DRC, where can you invest/grow it? Real estate? Property rights are too weak.  Stocks? No stock market. Gold? No bullion market. Startups? No ecosystem & a cultural..
228 2019-05-15 21:58:26 Stocks continued their rally in the US session after a steady Asian and European session with tech stocks leading the way as financials suffered.

Don't want them to reach for that livestream too quick. 
241 2019-05-15 21:51:44 Makes zero political sense for Trump to legalize over the next 6 years.  Why give Dems a victory when all they give him is a shit sangwich?
242 2019-05-15 21:50:20 The main reason the super-rich and all the Traders and people you see on business television hate tariffs is because it hurts the margins of the businesses and they deal in these stocks and that's how they make money...
243 2019-05-15 21:49:37 Why they fight about whos rising YG stocks ysterday. Istg, Im so done.
244 2019-05-15 21:49:09 Hype?

Did you do any research into $matic or are you purely all in on $xrp making that your shill of choice?

I really don't think you understand #crypto, organic growth is fantastic and is what we can see with most static stocks and also $btc when we look at yearly charts.

247 2019-05-15 21:47:58 For bullish stocks try scans in a daily squeeze that are within 10% of new 52 week highs.  Weeds out a lot of crap.
248 2019-05-15 21:47:49 Evening Market Wrap-up: stocks close higher amid tariff delay.
249 2019-05-15 21:47:31 Marijuana stocks are getting high. 
250 2019-05-15 21:47:10 Like $URA it appears that the ETF grows in size thru creation of Units by designated brokers participating. They buy the stocks and create units that increase the Assets Under Management, putting an upside lever on the component stocks as ETF grows, just like $URA used to do.
251 2019-05-15 21:44:46 So Beyonce had a g gig with uber 5 yrs ago...they offered too pay her $6 million...she said nope but opted for stocks in the company...she's poised  to make a 300 million dollar profit after the company went public...it's a long game people

The “Prison/Internment” business stocks have gone through the roof since tRump got power.

383 2019-05-15 20:30:20 My husband never picks up on this. I gaze sadly at my lunch a lot, while he goes in about what stocks he wants to buy. (I ramble about geeky shit all of the time so I let him ramble to me)
384 2019-05-15 20:29:57 The defense secretary didn’t have to divest his stocks in Boeing in order to attain his position. If we go to war, Is Boeing going to get big military contracts? This would enable him to profit greatly from a made up war and allow the preside to further grab for power.
385 2019-05-15 20:29:10 the boom/bust cycle of appreciated assets is a scam (mortgages, stocks, tulip bulbs, gold, silver, oil) I never cease to be amazed that people believe that when the stock market goes up somehow there is more value added to the world...HOW??? opinions of value are illusory.

387 2019-05-15 20:28:16 Professional money managers take your money and that of others and combine them into a huge chunk. They then invest into different stocks, commodities, bonds and businesses. 

The profit is then shared between the mutual fund company and contributors based on capital input.

We also believe that the price Target is half of its current share price of 354.96.

393 2019-05-15 20:23:55 Take full advantage of your company’s 401k plan and invest the maximum amount. Don’t have a 401k? Set aside a significant amount of your earnings to invest in stocks with big cash flows, strong B/S and strong leadership.

408 2019-05-15 20:17:14 Quick story.. my boy put $2500 on $sc in 2017 at around this price and I watched his bags pump to $40k. He didn't want to sell bc he wanted a year hold to avoid taxes. Held it all the way back down and recently sold to day trade stocks. Don't think he has any money left in CC :(
409 2019-05-15 20:17:09 World stocks higher: US +.6%; Europe +.5%. Indications, comments, tweets combined to give investors hope that trade issues will be resolved, if not soon, at least sometime. Anything is possible but a collapse is not priced into stocks & would cause severe market decline. Caution!

This way we can war forever and keep those defense stocks moving, right?

There has been some limited supply from corrupt regime  (Rather small) and capture via raids, but most stocks are older.

450 2019-05-15 19:58:24 I have, generally agree. Expect earnings recession spills into credit. Don't think spreads inconsistent with curve (recession in 20). Credit spreads bottomed in early 18 (early 99 and 05).  Spreads didn't really blow out until stocks really sold off (spring 00 and fall 07).
451 2019-05-15 19:58:21 Some of these stocks I had bought recently already dropped a ton, are heavily shorted despite strong sales growth, low debt, profitable, etc, so hey they should roast shorts and explode higher if the markets trend higher, right?  No they fucking plunge another 40%.  Fuck stocks.

Lol that bitched opened and bey was like “let’s gtfo NOW”
488 2019-05-15 19:43:49 The original point is deeply flawed. "Gets to pick where he works like the rest of us." No, we apply for jobs we want. And in whatever industry we pick, we gotta follow specific rules. Stocks? Sell houses? Needs license. Cop? Need training. People get transferred places.

494 2019-05-15 19:40:45 They still weird me out - as much as I love having them come over and invest. Weird as in the stocks don't have the stateside stability. I think as long as we innovate we're the best bet in finance-land.

514 2019-05-15 19:33:54 The Fast Money guys will probably love FANG stocks tonight
515 2019-05-15 19:33:15 #faang  have the faang stocks just pulled the wool over regulatrs eyes and got away without massive fines and regulations ????
516 2019-05-15 19:32:51 I've been in markets since 80's and never seen this. The worst economic data in a decade, countries in/at recessions, US may be in one for that matter (never recovered from 09), worst growth ever, highest debts ever and tweets save it daily. Stocks are the biggest lie.
517 2019-05-15 19:32:34 I was about to give up on investing in stocks until I actually learned what the heck I was doing, but today I logged in and saw that the money has increased!

518 2019-05-15 19:29:54 Difference between USD and BTC is the economy behind it IMO. Gold rose as a store of value because it enabled trade, and has remained a store of value that transcends borders. BTC may offer that value proposition, but it’s a mistake comparing BTC to USD or stocks...
519 2019-05-15 19:29:30 Agreed... It also helps me find names in consolidation easily. I just scan all stocks in sqs and run through the names couple times a week... helps me find names that might be ready to break out...
520 2019-05-15 19:29:18 Hey OTC Marijuana Stocks(@OtcMJStocks19), thank you for following me
521 2019-05-15 19:27:45 فيه خبر مأكد انهم بينسحبون؟
522 2019-05-15 19:27:36 MTN stocks are not available to the public yet. They are just getting listed not Public Offer. They however promised a public offer in future. You won't be able to buy even if you had a billion.
523 2019-05-15 19:26:36 What is after pot stocks?  Energy, Mining, Tech, Healthcare/biotech, BTC.Blockchain, Other???
524 2019-05-15 19:25:59 Should we also let gun owners decide what guns should be legal? Why should the government force me to turn in bump stocks or 30 round mags.
525 2019-05-15 19:25:58 my nail place now stocks vegan gel polish FUCKING GET IN
526 2019-05-15 19:25:49 Get your stocks up.
527 2019-05-15 19:25:21 If you have stocks in oil companies in the year of our Lord 2019 what are you even doing? You’re ruining the planet
528 2019-05-15 19:25:16 Market participants right now:

Buying China exposure on failed trade deal 

Buying industrials on declining industrial production 

Buying retail stocks on retail sales missing estimates by 60bps
529 2019-05-15 19:25:14 @foxs_biscuits which shops in the UK stocks Fox's Crinkle Crunch ginger biscuits please?
530 2019-05-15 19:25:11 Trading journals and trade reviews are effective tools because you’re not just learning your tendancies but the stocks tendencies, too. According to everyone, trader training has a 5% success rate. Very few businesses could keep their doors open with a 95% employee failure rate.
531 2019-05-15 19:24:48 My 4 stocks ( $LYFT, $XLK, $CADMF, $TLRY ) are still alive. Woowoo they will be continuing swing trade.

537 2019-05-15 19:21:24 Robinhood comes with limitations. As your trades are mostly swing trades, should be ok. I use jellifin (Rho finance), 40$ for unlimited options and stocks trade.
538 2019-05-15 19:20:43 Beyoncé must just teach us how to make our money make us money because wow. I want to tell my boss to pay me in stocks  whatever that is
539 2019-05-15 19:20:32 A3:  I’m lucky that my manager provided me a lot of good financial advice for buying stocks. It is great to learn from the news and podcasts, but at the same time you should still check with someone (i.e. a financial advisor) about your unique situation. #CreditChat #BoostAmerica
540 2019-05-15 19:20:12 I'm gonna start practicing my attack cancels in-between stocks.

Why did I never think of this.
541 2019-05-15 19:18:05 Charles, today’s market? Oils up yet services , midstream and producers barely moved ... or sunk.
But APPLE/FANG roll on! The Cook URINE trickle down market.. other stocks SPLASHED for .02 gain... supportive of your definition of a “ Broad Based” rally? @cvpayne @WSJ @LPNational
542 2019-05-15 19:17:37 A lot of the "ASCO" stocks have been trading weak today.
543 2019-05-15 19:17:31 $lyft $bynd on days like this, one might wonder why naked shorts are not allowed. Stocks run out of control because there are no shares to short to counter-balance the push.
544 2019-05-15 19:17:25 He needs to replace crypto with stocks and realize how ridiculous he sounds: 

I put $100 in all the stockcrap, I bought them all, and now it’s worth $30, that sucks.
545 2019-05-15 19:17:10 Anyone esle got uber stocks in their portfolio?
546 2019-05-15 19:17:01 My fiancé is teaching me about stocks and it’s so interesting.
547 2019-05-15 19:16:57 Interesting   $AAL $UAL $DAL $LUV If AAL or UAL were valued at similar multiples of sales of WestJet deal, those stocks could rise by about 90%. DAL could rise 20% and LUV is the one airline in the U.S. that trades at more than 100% of sales.
548 2019-05-15 19:16:51 I'll think about Limpbriskets.  One question..

549 2019-05-15 19:14:48 Trump banned bump stocks months ago
A solid argument can be made for magazine capacity limits
The only way to reduce the fire rate on semi autos that I know of is to fire a more powerful round
I've also heard solid arguments that rapid fire is less effective than semi auto
550 2019-05-15 19:14:40 When you get a reversal in stocks like was the case today as Linda said to her husband in Death of a Salesman: Attention must be paid.
551 2019-05-15 19:14:02 This will be for Uranium stocks in the future
552 2019-05-15 19:13:19 Yes and I leave it up to my financial planner to manage my stocks. I do pay close attention to the stock market so I can see if I’m gaining or losing money. I don’t get caught up with stocks on a day to day basis because I’m looking to the day when I retire.
553 2019-05-15 19:12:44 I only have a 401(k) that I know is invested in certain stocks. Not sure which ones they are. It seems like only the rich dabble in the stock market. I see the stock market going up and I think the rich are getting richer.
554 2019-05-15 19:12:26 By the way, just bought another 2500 CXXIF at just over $1.00 so not bashing, just asking...
555 2019-05-15 19:11:57 It’s not just Publix. Every sports store in the Bay Area stocks more Yankee gear than gear of teams from the local area. I don’t care if they’re spring training games are played in Tampa. It’s ridiculous.
556 2019-05-15 19:11:41 AEW is a private company, at this point in time—so, there are no stocks to buy.
557 2019-05-15 19:11:38 I’d own mutual funds not individual stocks. It is a much safer investment.
558 2019-05-15 19:11:33 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
559 2019-05-15 19:11:32 Hey Sammy, quick question: won't they have to open a Swell processing facility in NV itself to sell concentrate in the NV stores because they aren't allowed to transport cannabis products interstate at this time due to U.S. federal law?
560 2019-05-15 19:10:34 Yikes - yield curve is inverted on a 3 mo bill/10yr basis. Close to flat on 2/10's and steeply inverted on 1/5 basis.  Bad news: it is not different this time.  Good news, short interest in stocks is about as low as it can get
561 2019-05-15 19:09:13 So when we do start buying recession proof stocks...

563 2019-05-15 19:09:02 True patriot gun owners hate the NRA and the GOP, for all the years they were in power they didnt pass any pro gun legislation, in fact trump banned bump stocks, now that they lost a majority they are trying to act like only the democrats are trying to take our rights.
564 2019-05-15 19:08:27 Where can i buy stocks from AEW on god and heaven if you don't buy AEW stocks you are playing yourself
565 2019-05-15 19:06:44 Greg, do you thinks stocks will drop much lower before we get a rate cut?
566 2019-05-15 19:05:53 $OSTK is making $LFIN and $RIOT look like blue chip stocks.

568 2019-05-15 19:05:16 Invest your money in some Disney stocks. Imma do that for my kids.
569 2019-05-15 19:05:08 Responds to facts about dear leader with hashtags. . Thank you for proving your hypocrisy and the general inability of Trumptards to even argue for basic merits as to why Trump is “the best”. Btw so much for the economy doing well based upon stocks— just look at the DOW
570 2019-05-15 19:04:54 I like to locate the weakest sectors and stocks that took the biggest beat downs.
 and then when the market recovers...
  sell them to FOMO guys  as the rising tide raises all boats 

just kidding but hey it's Twitter so why not.

576 2019-05-15 19:00:09 Those companies will make less sales because of the price hike, employees will lose their jobs, stocks will go down. All this because an orange billion dollar loser is running the US.
577 2019-05-15 18:59:27 I’m loving these stocks and crypto currencies rn
578 2019-05-15 18:59:26 They probably have 0 stocks by now
579 2019-05-15 18:59:04 yes I agree with you 100% but it does cap the upside when stocks don’t break out to the all time highs like they should and run makes traders go away from the stock and wonder why it’s not breaking out if this stock can consolidate above it’s recent High  they’re in trouble
580 2019-05-15 18:58:10 If you go to the casino every day, you are a degenerate gambler. If you trade stocks ever day, you are a daytrader. 

The illness can be the same. Discipline is important for trading, and also for enjoying life outside of trading.

Technology stocks led all three major U.S. indexes into the black, setting them up for a second day of gains, but S&P 500 remained about 3% below its all-time high reached just over two weeks ago. The prospect…

591 2019-05-15 18:53:43 I bet the Grifter-in-Chief's long-term plan is to manipulate the stock market so that he and/or his surrogates can capitalize on the swings he causes. Buy low, sell high, short stocks. Trump sure looks like the greatest inside trader in American history. SEC should investigate.
592 2019-05-15 18:53:04 Today is a classic example of risk parity enabling fund managers to be brave and either buy the dip or not have to sell stocks on a big gap down open.

595 2019-05-15 18:51:32 This is all my opinion, but from my experience there are some semi-autos that are faster than others. There are ways to limit rate of fire in semi-auto weapons. Also, it's straight forward to regulate magazine size and "enhancers" like bump stocks.
596 2019-05-15 18:51:19 so u think that nasdaq pumps the stocks on their exchange when they dump? come on bro, wake up.

598 2019-05-15 18:51:12 Oh yeah to answer your ques yesterday: if your not interested in property, a skill set like stocks or forex, an index fund is always a nice investment venture to look into. @wesfrdrk

600 2019-05-15 18:50:27 stocks are down. We are seeing the limitations of stock investment to establish generational wealth. This focus on a grudge is unhelpful in pushing for redressing #ADOS people so we can be made whole. I cannot eat a fluctuating stock market. unfollowing from youtube.

607 2019-05-15 18:47:56 Ways I make extra money aside from my business: Online surveys. Invest in stocks, cryptocurrencies, and gold. Manage social media for other jewelry businesses (this applies to a lot of businesses and corporations). Test apps & websites. Start selling shit you no longer need/want.

613 2019-05-15 18:46:12 Problems going? I'm confused. $LABS has been one of the best performing stocks in the sector.  The large short position has partially contributed to the run, shorts only win when they gain momentum which has been nullified each time by bull-horns creating a squeeze

618 2019-05-15 18:44:38 Can the interns work on one that will just buy stocks that go up? That will please the CPA community although they then get cranky when you realize some cap gains.
619 2019-05-15 18:44:32 Google and Facebook are good examples for me of tech stocks in somewhat recent history that seemed expensive when they IPO’d but went on to do really well or spectacularly well:
- Google has gone up ~2000% (per Google Finance)
- Facebook has gone up ~400% (per Google Finance)

Huge opportunity for all involved to get the traders that love trading from a DOM in stocks!
624 2019-05-15 18:43:19 I've said it before and I'll say it again. My home was foreclosed by a court that approved of Wells Fargo using false affidavits, that's swearing false oaths... Court saw no reason to object to the perjury. So, I'm homeless now and Warren Buffett profits on his WF Stocks.
625 2019-05-15 18:43:00 The speculation on wall street to bid up builder stocks in late 2017 lead to 28%-38% bear markets in builder stocks in 2018. However, sales are still too low to make a top call in new home sales.

628 2019-05-15 18:40:27 let’s buy some stocks together.

636 2019-05-15 18:38:57 #bitcoin will replace, gold, bonds, all credit markets, and Fiat.. It will take back Store of Value from some Stocks and Real Estate. Money is the proper store of value. Store of value should have no idiosyncratic risk, i.e. riskless.
637 2019-05-15 18:37:53 @TCS has given 30% CAGR and @HDFC_Bank has given 25% CAGR over 10 years. Then why are people buying into useless SIPs and hybird funds that only give 10-15% CAGR ?? #mutualfunds #stocks #StockMarkets #mutualfundssahihai

641 2019-05-15 18:35:45 Tweeting out news and buying stocks. What a legend

643 2019-05-15 18:34:38 In my opinion, in order to make sound decisions in regards to buying and selling real estate one should have at least a basic understanding of how that industry works. (i.e. financial literacy which included real estates, stocks bonds, basic checks and balances, loans, etc.)

646 2019-05-15 18:33:19 not going to debate this any longer but point is this is not a $DBX issue,-if you focus on stk comp, you've missed most of the best growth stocks in the mkt over the past many years- real dollars- that's anyone's choice
647 2019-05-15 18:33:02 The attempt to link this to climate change is yet another illustration  of irrational climate alarmism. The decline of fish stocks has little or nothing to do with climate change. It's mostly caused by overfishing.

654 2019-05-15 18:30:09 Pension plans are invested in stocks. Most stocks move to near zero in the gold standard because the "E" in "PE" will go negative in most cases.

657 2019-05-15 18:28:54 Also another idea one could look at is election sentiment wale stocks like Reliance strangle buy say 1300/1200 and available at 60rs (5% of the stock) and  this doesn't  even have circuits. U may try it, cheaper than nifty strangles.. 20% movements possible who knows..

674 2019-05-15 18:18:58 Ask the owners about how it all started.
Hint: There was a long strike/bandh. The owners didn't know how to keep the workers 'employed/busy'
All the dry stocks were asked to be 'pounded'
The excessive stock was sold in the form of MTR M..... 
Rest is history.
675 2019-05-15 18:18:54 Increased volume and volatility around US market open is a surprise and not intuitive. EUAs aren't stocks, aren't correlated to anything really over there, and there's no reason for North American players to trade them except for speculation.
676 2019-05-15 18:18:48 Why aren't these policies on @amazonIN this is just a common lie for u people now whats the need to take orders when u dun have stocks does that mean that u deliberately make people suffer for their money remove these sellers or close this site now

"For the Blazers defense, that carom off rim might as well have been what economists call a “dead cat bounce,” the term for collapsing stocks that flash a brief, illusory moment of success."
725 2019-05-15 17:57:08 I would venture to say real estate vs stocks. Stock market can go up or down in a day.
726 2019-05-15 17:56:37 as per @IIF "On the back of the recent flare-up in trade tensions between the US and China, outflows from Chinese equities totaled over $2.5 bn last week, averaging around $600 mn net outflows daily." Friendly reminder: post-12/24/18 risk-on rally originated in Chinese stocks.

728 2019-05-15 17:56:19 $FTCH will report after the close. Price & volume action tells me that we are in for a monster drop. But that is just a guess and has no meaning. If the stocks gaps up tomorrow it might provide us with a actionable gap just $PINS. #stocks #LeaveTheEarningsGambleToTheSuckers

731 2019-05-15 17:54:21 Finally, people are asking what stocks Trump and family, friends have and how he is moving markets to his benefit by tweeting.  Totally criminal. Trumps are hiding their assets and committing crimes.
732 2019-05-15 17:54:11 Buy stocks in weed lol
733 2019-05-15 17:54:07 @SRuhle      How about the fact that Trump let's his buddies know when he's about to cause the market to crash? Really, am I the only one who thought about manipulating the stock market to short stocks and buy back cheap. whose looking into this?
734 2019-05-15 17:53:44 This market has me thinking about margin of safety in terms of shock value. Say markets rallied another 10-20% from here (which of course they can). That would shock many, but positively. No one would dare sell the rally... cuz stocks always go up...
735 2019-05-15 17:53:23 breaking out of an IH&S on higher time frames it seems
736 2019-05-15 17:53:21 thereare some computer models that suggest we could be seeing major problems by 2030, then there's what i call highly optimistic  models that say we see much until 2100. but i think by 2050 it won't be just global warming, we will have a total collapse of fish stocks and worse

740 2019-05-15 17:50:42 @VelshiRuhle Trump is a cheap day trader. No offense to day traders intended. He speaks out of someplace other than his mouth for the benefit of friends & family who have certain stocks. He manipulates markets w/words. He is a pseudo human. Even AI would be better than Trump.
741 2019-05-15 17:49:34 MSNBC guest talking about how Trump goosed the stock market today with an announcement. Indicated that his announcements are manipulating certain stocks.

743 2019-05-15 17:48:31 The momentum in crypto can't be ignored. Even if it is exchanges pumping. I must say the risk reward ratios are far better than stocks. The volatility however is the entry fee. bla bla bla just an opinion etc
744 2019-05-15 17:46:36 Beyoncé performed for Uber in 2015.Instead of accepting her $6M cheque, she requested to be paid in stocks. Today her stocks are worth over $300M. 

Last year,she took half of $8M Coachella offered her in exchange for the rights to the show.This week, Netflix paid her $60M for it
745 2019-05-15 17:46:23 @arunjaitley @FinMinIndia @PMOIndia @narendramodi its basics that this is the worst hapazard unplanned way of divestments! do an OFS but give a lock in of 3 yrs so that someone other than LIC buys these stocks! its shocking how can dept of divestment commit such basic mistakes!

754 2019-05-15 17:42:02 I was reminded today why I stopped using @multicharts (but forgot).
You cannot just type a ticker and go on their charts. You have to first load each and every ticker manually into their 'quote manager' in this format:
MSFT, USD Stock MSFT (NASDAQ), SMART, Stocks
755 2019-05-15 17:42:00 Do not compare China’s stock mkt with US’s, they do not share similar importance to their civilians. Only a small portion of Chinese citizens’ wealth are in the stocks; more is in savings accounts, or real estate.
756 2019-05-15 17:41:48 This story is deceptive.  It wasn’t steel tariffs that caused a decline in steel stocks.  While the term is misused quite a bit... this is a true example of “Fake News”.
757 2019-05-15 17:41:33 It's currently fitted with just 2 CIWS not 3, if that was considered sufficient for a peer threat. Also do escorts have sufficient missile stocks - all depends on scenario and threat picture

760 2019-05-15 17:40:10 Algos think that lower interest rates signal its time to get long duration assets, aka growth stocks. When in reality it’s signaling recession & growth stocks will be down 50-60%. #algotradingisdumbmoney
761 2019-05-15 17:40:09 and you had an outside professional expert review the code and make the proper fixes:

777 2019-05-15 17:28:36 I remember Trump damaging them with his big mouth months back... Then he praised them... Stocks recovered. Now this. My head spins. I think a lot of stuff is connected though of course I can't prove it. Strange stuff to watch.
778 2019-05-15 17:28:34 When economic wars become extremely fierce, there is risk of a real war. While a war with China is unlikely, even the increased threat of a war would send stocks crashing and could push up inflation.
779 2019-05-15 17:28:03 Yes. Fed told us their goal is to prolong the cycle. They prolonged the bull market, but their is no doubt recession is here already. Stocks will take a bit of time to reflect given centrally planned market. In a capitalist system, they would reflect by now, bc data would matter.

906 2019-05-15 16:33:55 You know those people who demand that we should "bring back..." things - it's never anything good is it? This passing thought brought to you via the comments section of the local rag, where someone wants the return of both the pillory and stocks.
907 2019-05-15 16:33:48 I will try selling online after eventtt sobss ;w;/ and see if I can give you free when I have leftover stocks.

909 2019-05-15 16:32:40 The Fed messed up by not raising the rates and were stale. We don't need the Fed to lower rates,   The economy will take care of itself.

If u find any one of these stocks going down with heavy volumes, then short the hell out of them, I bet you will make Profits 8 out of 10 times.
917 2019-05-15 16:30:37  nice

I get that with stocks. If the company goes bankrupt your shares are going to be worth nothing or next-to-nothing. 

With bank deposits, you are covered up to a certain amount by their insurance. 

Anyhow for now I just scratched $BIS and $LUX from my own asset sheet.

932 2019-05-15 16:19:31 I have seen people fall in love with their stocks. I remember, in 2008/9 I recommended my colleague to buy JPAsso at Rs30. It went up to 100, I told him to sell but he didn't. Still, he is holding. Hope doesn't work here. Don't know when those kind of people will understand this
933 2019-05-15 16:19:14 It costs money to be poor. Ex: my mom is mid class and when things go on sale (food, toiletries, gas) she stocks up. She can stock up and save money. She also has a place she can store bulk items such as a freezer. Poor ppl who live pay to pay can’t do this.

976 2019-05-15 16:06:20 It's really tough when people refuse to connect up the dots. The indicators of a healthy economy are there. BUT a whopping 84% of all stocks are owned by the wealthiest 10% of households. These are jobs galore: part-time/no benefits. Breaking it down. Who's benefiting?
977 2019-05-15 16:06:03 Once again, lost 600 points or so it’s continuing to drop, and apple lost 5% of their stocks this is helping no one buddy
978 2019-05-15 16:05:15 Bonds also green today.

Trump surrendered on a key campaign issue to increase the value of stocks and bonds held by the rich.
979 2019-05-15 16:05:05 His analogy is incorrect. He didn’t buy all the alts and if he compared that to buying all the stocks (5000+) he forgot to mention the 275 companies that went bankrupt. Sorry Mr. Wonderful, you are comparing apples to vehicles @APompliano

1029 2019-05-15 15:53:15 Je reviens d une journée de collage et le constat est le même... Il y a même des petites communes où ils ont justes sorti leurs stocks de panneaux et de planches pr faire style sans numéroter... Faudra à l'avenir trouver une solution pour que tout le monde respecte les règles.
1030 2019-05-15 15:53:07 Bump stocks is a red herring anyway

1032 2019-05-15 15:52:13 Diesel & RFO builds despite sweeter slate. This will accelerate as refiners pick up run rates.

Hard to see how US will draw on stocks until LLS MEH make a clean break from Brent. MEH/LLS-Brent has held despite ~40MMbl build in PADD3 in past 8 weeks.

1036 2019-05-15 15:50:48 Stocks spent most of 2018 ignoring wider credit spreads, only to rapidly correct in Q4.  Now they are ignoring the yield curve, global PMIs, industrial commodities, other leading indicators, & credit spreads once again. There will be another brutal snap back to reality in 2019.

1039 2019-05-15 15:49:06 Better chart would be versus gold. In real terms stocks help, but gold is better in credit/currency collapse.
1040 2019-05-15 15:48:36 Personally, I’ve see couple friends do it, then watched them get surgery to fix it. Think long term like stocks, will it be worth more in end game, or will you have to recoupe it (fix it) later. Hope helps.

1047 2019-05-15 15:45:06 @Scot1andT just pointed out that he see the century mark (100$) in $BYND as a logical mark which is likely to attract buying just like in $GH. I totally agree with him on that! Watch it! #stocks #trading

1060 2019-05-15 15:41:11 Exactly. China has been selling actually. It's decreasing holdings. What has the dollar done??? SKYWARD. What have rates done? PLUNGED. Whether China does or does not do this is irrelevant. Bond market is telling you stocks are WAY OVERVALUED. Bond market is never wrong. 2s/10s

1065 2019-05-15 15:38:29 The US govt wrote an AIG-like $200T off balance sheet insurance policy that is now coming on balance sheet, the American public is at its most politically divided in 50 yrs, and we have 9 guns for every 10 people.

1068 2019-05-15 15:37:43 Getting in on the Uber IPO with a reasonable position was a breeze thanks to Trump. IPO valued at $45 got a position at $36.6. Instant tariff karma and now up $5 per share racing for the valuation. Dump or Ride? #trading #stocks #tariffs #ridethepanic #ipo #uber

1070 2019-05-15 15:36:30 Nows the time to buy and I’m sure Wayne will agree. Lots of earnings are about to be reported so prices are going to Spike but right now a lot of investable stocks are low.

1073 2019-05-15 15:35:39 Trump surrendered on a major campaign issue 30 minutes ago because stocks were down half a percent. You are insane.
1074 2019-05-15 15:35:34 ...of course, all this is out the window in and around FOMC meetings. Then, bonds and stocks could go up or down together. That is repricing. Only the bond market can deliver a real sell-off. And the bond market is intently focused on the FED, the only game in town!
1075 2019-05-15 15:35:33 is, with the proceeds from those missed pot stocks, did i make or lose.  if i made, i forget which names i moved into....or if i lost, regardless, over time it is all a wash, by retirement, all good stories to tell and hopefully portfolio has grown in size more than today, and of
1076 2019-05-15 15:35:19 Because perhaps some retail investors look for opportunity or rather assume there is 'easy money' to be made when stocks languish like this. And unfortunately there is enough noise for 'buy for long term'
1077 2019-05-15 15:35:02 Trump banned bump stocks tho

1080 2019-05-15 15:34:23 ...when yields go back down on stocks going down, know that there will be a place where market finds stocks attractive and rallies. There are patterns in the correlations between yield curve and outright yields and stocks to watch for indications....

1083 2019-05-15 15:34:06 Stock Investing Myths You Should Stop Believing:

Myth 1: Popular Companies are the Best for Good Investing in stocks- For instance, General Electric is one of the most popular companies in the United States, but in the last few years, they have lost lots of their share value.

1088 2019-05-15 15:32:52 The data doesn't matter. It hasn't mattered for a long time. Data mattered pre-2008. The only data to keep an eye on is PCE, CPI, and GDP. Period. And only bc fed watches it. Watch yields, market will give you hints, not the data. Yields down, buy stocks, yields flat/up, sell....

1098 2019-05-15 15:29:28 Trump has surrendered his entire presidency to boost the wealth of people who opposed his election and despise his voters.

He just surrendered on trade to the EU because stocks were down 0.5%.

I've never seen anything so shameful.
1099 2019-05-15 15:29:05 I have been saying this. War is very profitable for those with defense company stocks like Trump. He’s just been trying to see who he can push into it first. This guy is going to start WWIII.
1100 2019-05-15 15:28:51 There weren't any tariffs on European cars last year. Not sure why not having cars this year is a reason to buy stocks. If it wasn't last year, why is it this year?

1105 2019-05-15 15:26:13 It may be dangerous but I have not looked at my gold stocks in the last two weeks. I'm not planning on selling anytime soon and I get the overall gist and sentiment from the stuff I track. I do watch the price of gold as a proxy. Has helped me chill.

1110 2019-05-15 15:21:38 Another tidbit on ATH's in the SPX:  2015 was the only year since 1928 where SPX attained an ATH in Q2 and subsequently sold off at least 13% from that high.   While anything is always possible, historically stocks have not topped in Q2 at ATH's ahead of a bear market.
1111 2019-05-15 15:21:37 So having margin is basically like asking for a loan to a drug dealer, he/they set up the rules as he/they please. Thanks TD for making this common sense fact clear! No need for a "higher understanding" on this. #stocks #StockMarket #StockMarketNews #WallSt #investment

1124 2019-05-15 15:15:06 You’re making terrible decisions that are hurting our country, that’s why we want you out, not jealousy, not revenge, not because you weren’t a politician, because you are trying to hurt women, hurt the environment, hurt immigrants, hurt stocks, hurt our foreign policy and trade.
1125 2019-05-15 15:15:03 My mom is an investor and has been my entire life. She gave me two stocks, Coke and McDonald's, when I was 12 and told to follow them. Twenty some odd years later I regret not learning what she does for a living. And it's not the only time she did that.
1126 2019-05-15 15:14:05 i know someone who configured alexa to buy stocks at his command.
1127 2019-05-15 15:14:00 Trump tied his entire presidency to stocks which is the dumbest thing a politician can do but he did it anyway.
1128 2019-05-15 15:13:49 All politicians must NOT buy stocks or have any stocks in their private lives while serving.... Most of the DC decisions are based on money and their pockets...

1134 2019-05-15 15:12:34 @realDonaldTrump is playing the market. Tells everyone they’ll be tariffs and stocks fall. Gets his mates to buy at the bottom and then delays the tariffs. Stocks recover, instant profits. Ultimate con man
1135 2019-05-15 15:12:21 Just make sure you let all your wealthy friends know before doing so, so they can buy the stocks they sold before your announcement of raising tariffs.

Using a cat like a truffle pig, but for life saving drugs.
1139 2019-05-15 15:11:14 Les stocks de pétrole sont assez faibles
1140 2019-05-15 15:10:24 The fact there are only 2 stocks in this entire market, $BYND and $ROKU, AT ATH, is the reason these two are so HOT. Simply Supply/Demand. People want to bet bull... But there are no bull stocks
1141 2019-05-15 15:10:05 I hope The N10,000 for opening an account can also be used to buy stocks?

1150 2019-05-15 15:06:14 Yep. A lot of these stocks will be volatile due to the market and trade war, but over time this will be a big winner
1151 2019-05-15 15:06:04 The premise is, per capita consumption is not demand. Consumption is a calculated metric that looks at beginning stocks, production, and imports less exports and ending stocks. It's disappearance, assuming we consume everything put onto the market.
1152 2019-05-15 15:05:48 What stocks do they like?

FWIW, I can time my love affair with #USOP precisely to the date of their suspension from PLUS, announced on 25/8/2011.

1157 2019-05-15 15:04:56 I’ve been to Alabama. Walmart stocks booze but they won’t sell it to you on a Sunday.  Strangest thing.  Sort of like Ontario in the 70’s minus the Walmart.
1158 2019-05-15 15:04:37 Nah. It will be revived. Tickers and publicly traded stocks are worth more than you think. This will run again..just not under Ken Williams
1159 2019-05-15 15:04:35 Ils ne sont pas bêtes, après la WW2, pour lutter contre l'éventualité agressive de l'URSS, ils ont crée l'OTAN pour avoir ainsi leurs stocks achetés par leurs alliés obligés et affidés. Donc ils s'étonnent maintenant que les subordonnés ne veulent plus mastéguer leur chewing gum.

1167 2019-05-15 15:03:00 I think it is a horrible strategy for any other asset than crypto. In stocks it could take you a decade or longer to break even if you picked the top. Less likely to wait that long if you're in crypto as it seems to be moving up in a quick sequence of bubbles.

1189 2019-05-15 14:54:30 It's very simple. If they are current stocks you will find them listed on the Stock Exchange. Old stocks can be looked up at any library.  Finally, multiply current stock price by the number of shares and voila... you're an instant millionaire.

1205 2019-05-15 14:50:05 Liquidating a portfolio in a declining market should be a gradual process in which you sell off your weakest names first and hold onto those which have yet to give a sell signal.  This way if the market does stabilize you are well positioned in stocks showing relative strength.

1284 2019-05-15 14:28:14 Stocks rally that we're business as usual? Not convinced any semblance of those tariffs were negatively priced in, so is that good enough to surge indices & forget the crap data, China tariffs, trade impasse etc? What a time.

1332 2019-05-15 14:15:12 Stocks like Reinet and Mediclinic are underappreciated as Rand hedges in my book. Mediclinic is forming a base and would be particularly attractive if it drops to R60 (with a tight stop, say R58.80). Quilter at R24 to R23 - if it gets there.

1365 2019-05-15 14:02:03 This "wait and see" strategy is frankly speculative investing. Using a single template for all companies is not really a good idea. For one thing, it means you may not have good understanding about their various industries and the issues that impact their stocks.
1366 2019-05-15 14:02:01 84% of the value of those stocks is held by 10% of our population. It's the same answer you got when you asked last time. The stock market tells you how well wealthy are doing, not the working class.

1400 2019-05-15 13:53:08 US stocks open lower on weak economic data from here in the states and from China.  Dow -163 points.
1401 2019-05-15 13:52:42 I hope your stocks will keep up with your expectations. After all, stocks do not account for a large proportion of China's economy.

1407 2019-05-15 13:50:29 I did not cherry pick the article- this stat is being reported from dozens of media outlets. As I said in other posts, it's strange that production is up and stocks are down. I'd love to know the cause of that. Are these just short-term orders? Very odd.
1408 2019-05-15 13:50:18 RT CNNBusiness: US stocks opened lower as investors came to grips with worse-than-expected retail sales and industrial production numbers for April.
 
The Dow kicked off 154 points, or 0.6%, lower
The S&P 500 opened down 0.6%
The Nasdaq opened 0.6% lower.

 IndusInd Bank, ICICI Bank and YES Bank, along with index heavyweight HDFC were among the top drags. They together were responsible for half of the point-wise decline in Sensex. A look at the Nifty Private Bank index shows it declined
0.92 per cent.

 Italian stocks declined 0.7 per cent to lead European stocks lower while France's benchmark slipped 0.4 per cent, Reuters reported.

1757 2019-05-15 10:55:43 Bearish global cues

The selling in global stocks intensified amid poor cues from European markets amid fresh worries over mounting Italian debt. Grim Chinese data added to the concerns casting a shadow over global markets.

1768 2019-05-15 10:51:29 Crocodile tears. The bloody shame is on us for putting up with this degradation of vulnerable people. It’s a modern version of public hangings or the stocks. Who the fuck is JK to judge and humiliate people.
1769 2019-05-15 10:51:27 U.S. markets: Stocks took a breather yesterday after President Trump called U.S.-China trade tensions “a little squabble” and reassured Wall Street he’s working on a deal.
1770 2019-05-15 10:49:41 When you trade labor for money...then invest and risk that money in stocks, you are  making your money work for you... essentially this increases the value of your labor by giving the product of that labor an extra benefit of generating additional income.
1771 2019-05-15 10:49:41 Public stocks. See if they are brave enough to cast a stone until the penny drops.

1778 2019-05-15 10:47:02 Fully agree @lenwej , yet, they apply a "logic": they have to achieve a target so they are buying stocks that allow them to reach the goal. Fund managers are more and more algo or behaving like algo and machines do not have consciousness

1780 2019-05-15 10:46:12 Dutch government nationalized 2 banks during the crisis to prevent them from collapsing, which was likely when stocks prices were dropping and people starting to move money away.
Years later the government started to sell the shares again.

1804 2019-05-15 10:24:56 Good synopsis. Vodafone, centrica, Royal Mail, itv, sse, bt, grocers, banks et al: almost all classic value stocks are heavily out of favour. Many of these businesses are terminally valued imho with 0 upside priced in. I do feel the economy is primed for a very good period.

1825 2019-05-15 10:08:11 It wasn't a major eyebrow raise . I just feel it's probably neutral rather than win-win.

1890 2019-05-15 09:29:03 the attitude that it is abuse to hit a woman who is out of line is ahistorical. The prevailing attitude of European Christendom is that if a man failed to discipline his wife, the village would do so via the branks, pillory stocks, or the flogs

2018 2019-05-15 07:38:40 Stock investments are for more than 7 years as per my experience, example arvind Mills & sterlite technologies which I started buying in 2010 & it started moving big time after 2017. 10 baggers in 8 years.

2022 2019-05-15 07:33:26 So true that - selling out entirely because Valuation seems too high is probably a big mistake  (look at #GRG !!) - if you must Sell a Topslice seems to work better. People get too easily shaken out of Great Stocks.

2024 2019-05-15 07:32:31 Market has truly become stupid. So equities ignores China and does not look around - suddenly AFTER someone got massively squeezed in the Bund while panic selling BTP - they wake up and in low volume hit stocks hard.

2061 2019-05-15 07:04:37 I invest in stocks for a living. There are some known risks I take and some unknown risks.

2083 2019-05-15 06:55:39 The pattern calls for a 30-40% decline at the very least and puts Nifty on the edge.

2084 2019-05-15 06:55:31 More instructive to note that these low PE generally junk stocks outperform for one year (like 2017) and then underperform for next 3-4 years. And generally public gets in the bull phase (like 2017) and gives up in the subsequent bear phase. Hence most people end up losing money
2085 2019-05-15 06:53:42 Point is taken that in India high PE high growth stocks outperform and low P/E stocks generally have severe problems and hence the market in its wisdom giving it low PE. But why compare from Jan 18 when phase of high quality high PE outperformance started.

2109 2019-05-15 06:35:59 Yes one of the reasons was how big the drawdown is/was. Mind you the chart of the ETF shows -50% in Dec 2018, but Chinese mainland stocks peaked in 2007 at a much higher level so the drawdown was actually over -65% at one point I believe.

2297 2019-05-15 04:04:26 4 key lessons from intelligent investor
•Base decision  on the value of the underlying business.
•Look for no- brainer opportunities
•The higher the price, the riskier the investment 
•Buying lightly traded stocks is risky.
2298 2019-05-15 04:03:45 The number of stocks in your portfolio depends inversely on your skills. The higher the skillset you have the less stocks you can own ...if you have no skills at picking the stock just purchase the nifty ETFs and sleep peacefully for 20years....

2372 2019-05-15 03:11:07 U.S. Markets Check U.S. stocks rebounded as President Donald Trump moved to reassure markets that he’ll clinch a trade deal with China. The yield on 10-year Treasuries remained at 2.41 percent.
2373 2019-05-15 03:10:28 I’m sitting on my couch taking a shit eating fresh kitchen playing video games fucking my girl and trading stocks.
2374 2019-05-15 03:10:13 Free trade means same rules for both trading partners.  Not the case with China when H.W. Bush gave them "favored nation status."  We can't buy , their companies or their stocks.  They get controlling interest in joint ventures and peg their currency. Is that free trade?
2375 2019-05-15 03:10:12 It’s just interesting to me that some stocks that have AV related existential risk, like CVNA, get a pass while Uber does not. I do very much think Uber will turn a profit in coming years - just less confident of the multiple it’ll get til there is more clarity on impact from AVs

2377 2019-05-15 03:08:10 $SPY There's more than enough of good information on trading stocks. The most difficult part for novice is knowing what to weed out and knowing what to keep. to know what's good and what's bad.
2378 2019-05-15 03:08:05 As much as we all love talented  Beyonce we are pretty sure she has actual business advisors who do this for her and then recommend ...I doubt  she has the time or understanding to go through stocks herself
2379 2019-05-15 03:07:00 1. Assault rifles are capable of full auto and have been banned since 1987
2. The Trump administration expanded the legal definition of machine gun to include bump stocks, effectively banning them.
3. The private transfer of firearms from one citizen to another is not a loophole

2387 2019-05-15 03:02:39 #2 - The pursuit of strength. Resist the temptation to buy too many value and/or beat down stocks. Some investors are good at this, I’m not. A flyer now and then is fine, but time and time again I find these suck for a reason. High relative strength almost always does better.
2388 2019-05-15 03:02:25 Bought stocks today. Are we worried about something? 

My only point of sadness was not getting them yesterday.

2394 2019-05-15 02:57:59 It's just simple, get a proxy ready with lots of cash, send negative tweets about China trade deals & the stock/commodities MKT will nose dive then the proxy will buy. Send positive tweets that will have the markets pick up then offload. These could be penny stocks in large vol.

2400 2019-05-15 02:52:54 Oh my, why would stocks plunge upon winning of admin's bets? First and foremost, as article said, it is due to factora like US-China trade war. That's why we are here to befriend both of them because both can affect our economy.
2401 2019-05-15 02:52:44 Dili mn wrong actually nga mag invest ug money ang mga pastor. Galing lang ang ila mn gudd giinvesan kay scam man gud. Imagine. 30% return. In one month! Akoa man gne stocks, oina ka dako nga return is 15% rmm gane. Last year papajud to. Ilaha kay every month.

2410 2019-05-15 02:46:32 $SPY Just because you're trading short term swing trades doesn't mean you trade just anything. I use technical analysis for timing my trades but I also want that long term trend (in quality growth stocks) in my favor.
2411 2019-05-15 02:43:56 If that was true, then pistol grips stocks would be on every long gun. They're not! Bolt action rifles are the most accurate, and most don't have pistol grips.

You don't spend much time on a gun range and it shows.

2416 2019-05-15 02:41:26 I imagine a portfolio w/ sector weightings the same as $RSP, though only owning 1 or 2 stocks in each sector, would match the performance fairly closely even though the portfolio would by no means be equally weighted.

2423 2019-05-15 02:35:28 @realDonaldTrump the Smoot-Hawley tariffs represent a cautionary tale. ..whether they were the major cause of the Great Depression ..today where Central Banks have been pumping out liquidity and inflating stocks, similar to the 1920s, we cannot repeat the mistake of Smoot-Hawley.
2424 2019-05-15 02:34:42 @cppib suggests we have diversified stocks but digging into the institutional holders of the companies they invest in,  it's the same groups: Google, Microsoft, Alphabet,  Statestreet, Blackrock, Vanguard etc.

2435 2019-05-15 02:25:37 Of course they're interested in investing in marijuana stocks...now.  Were they interested before stocks took off? No. You should be talking to them about uranium stocks so they can get in early to a trend. Just my opinion...

2438 2019-05-15 02:23:11 I'm surprised Jeremy Kyle was still making new shows. It's something very much of its time, like the stocks.
2439 2019-05-15 02:22:19 What’s the difference between stocks and currencies?
2440 2019-05-15 02:21:34 Why? Too many lawyers? Law school takes decades to pay for these days. Degrees are like stocks. The market on lawyers has been bullish for a while.
2441 2019-05-15 02:21:21 Agreed. Too many stocks with too much freedom. I’m conservative, but when blatant market manipulation is occurring unchecked, I have a MAJOR issue. $TPNI for instance has yet to reach out to shareholders. Should be ILLEGAL, because I’m holding 8 million + shares without response.

2447 2019-05-15 02:17:28 If you are not willing to cut your losses short, then you probability should not buy stocks.

2459 2019-05-15 02:08:10 What stocks do you think are ready for a big move? Looking for 25% or more...
2460 2019-05-15 02:06:27 I bought stocks that have gone to zero...
2461 2019-05-15 02:05:42 Now we'll hear perma-bulls, like the clowns on CNBC, saying bad China numbers increase the chance of a trade deal cos China are desperate 
Any narrative to support mindless buying of stocks.
2462 2019-05-15 02:05:09 But is it a private company when it sells stocks ?
2463 2019-05-15 02:03:32 no heart feeling of course.

2465 2019-05-15 02:01:54 Does any1 think that #trump realizes wht he says controls the stock market and before he says something moronic, he sells stocks. Then when the market plummets he buys them back, and lies to the public about how great trade talks are going? Annoying but brilliant at the same time
2466 2019-05-15 02:01:50 How’s the book so far? Would you recommend it?

2468 2019-05-15 02:01:15 Hell is a huge grocery store that stocks every single manufacturer’s product that they ever produced. It is cold there, Arctic conditions. Outrageous prices. 
True purgatory.
2469 2019-05-15 02:00:14 $inve  ER reports are basically meaningless for this turd as it is manipulated endlessly every day with such low float.  Up and down big for no reasons just whim of manipulators of super small stocks like this with very limited prospects.

2471 2019-05-15 01:59:13 Just to play devil's advocate, what % of other countries' exports are to the US? If you buy international stocks are you buying companies that just sell a ton to the US?
2472 2019-05-15 01:58:57 Buy stocks
2473 2019-05-15 01:58:25 Should be. But due to the distorting effect of these tax measures, I reckon most of the squeaky wheels about these issues are hugely overweight in Aussie income stocks or neg geared property.

2502 2019-05-15 01:38:20 I fucking hate the tariffs, basically the government got the money but every citizen is paying for it. Because everything is going to cost more and I am losing money on stocks also! Tariffs not only hurt everyone’s life but also hurt the companies.

2504 2019-05-15 01:36:13 But now you just betting on inflation. Appreciation isn’t guaranteed and it’s got zero cash flow... Stocks that pay dividends, property that earns you rent THOSE are investments not your house that costs $1500 a month

Prior to the presidency, Trump bankrupted every business venture he attempted and the bankruptcies were all due to his corrupt dealing and stealing from his own companies.

2540 2019-05-15 01:16:51 Good morning 

stocks appear most attractive on a fundamental basis at the peak of their business cycle

 when they represent the worst risk-reward ratio,

and

least attractive at the bottom of the cycle when the opportunity is at its best.
2541 2019-05-15 01:16:33 So it was better than the last time.. More money.. Got it.. The stocks will go up and down.. Right now they're higher than anyone could have anticipated.. This despite the volatile market.. Tell the full story sir!

Last year she took half of the $8m from coachella in exchange for the rights to the show, Netflix paid her $60m for it
2634 2019-05-15 00:23:19 I think they’re playing the market like a fiddle, snatching up stocks Trump forces down with his tariff taunts. Why always a big “rebound” after a big sell-off? Whose making $$ off this shit??
2635 2019-05-15 00:23:05 I just saw someone praising praising Beyonce for accumulating millions in Uber stocks after she did an ad for them, like Uber drivers didn't just go on a strike for fair pay last week.

2646 2019-05-15 00:15:21 The Japanese have been working out the kinks for years for endless QE. No more JGB market, they own 1/3 of stocks, something like that. If there's no inflation and you monetize your debt, who cares? So FED now maybe goes fuller retard like ECB and Japan.

2651 2019-05-15 00:12:44 Dunno about that. Steel employment is down 4 percent, some of biggest steel co.’s stocks dropped 47 percent in 2018.

Rising steel prices hurt demand as well, because manufacturers have to absorb higher cost by passing to consumers
