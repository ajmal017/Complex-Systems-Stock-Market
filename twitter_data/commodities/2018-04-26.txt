48 2018-04-26 19:51:27 No. The number of commodities subject to tariffs has been increasing the last few years, including since June 23rd 2016 and the total revenue paid by UK consumers has also been rising.

51 2018-04-26 19:45:53 What you are elegantly demonstrating, wether you know you are or not, is that things like background checks only effect those who are inclined to participate. Criminals do what they want and commodities like guns flow like water, down the path of least resistance.

75 2018-04-26 18:15:55 Hello sisters, 

What's consumptive utilisation? it's a useful phrase to think with particularly for those of us who're against turning wildlife into commodities, i.e. valuable because they bring in revenue to the state or to private conservators.

three years into a bull market vs. a decade-long run for stocks
tilts relative value toward physical commodities as inflation
and global GDP sustain recoveries.
91 2018-04-26 17:25:45 @markets : Commodities appear to be in an early stage recovery from what
could prove to be a major bottom for the asset class.

93 2018-04-26 17:15:25 But black people (decendents of American slaves) should be self interested and move politically as a group.

96 2018-04-26 16:55:09 Going forward, we will be watching $DXY very closely when making any calls on commodities. U.S. Dollar should continue to strengthen over the next couple months and drive direction in commodities.
97 2018-04-26 16:52:58 Trade tensions continue to rise, this decision could make Brazil a stronger competitor with U.S. Ag commodities. #worried
98 2018-04-26 16:46:27 I said no such thing. I said a child needs a father. It was the child I was concerned about. I do think it's bad for society in general though and children are turned into commodities when intentionally cut off at birth from a biological parent.
99 2018-04-26 16:45:13 As a farmer myself, Trump thankfully never had me. I could see through his thin, orange skin like Saran Wrap. But hopefully, my brethren in agriculture now realize he doesn't give a damn about us and couldn't even spell "commodities" if it was just on Fox & Friends.

104 2018-04-26 16:18:01 Commodities, particularly oil, tend to perform well during late stage of economic expansions. Growth becomes inflationary and Fed hikes, often tipping the economy over into recession...
105 2018-04-26 16:15:17 40yr mortgages may have helped fuel the fire, but 2 things matter in pricing commodities; supply & demand. LT mortgages made it easier to bid up the homes, which fueled demand, while muni's sat on their hands when it came to bldg supply.

114 2018-04-26 15:50:40 The decision to crack imported corn creates unfair playing field in organic livestock prod. Research show advantage in ruminants to steam rolled or steam flaked corn.  The action creates two commodities within the organic corn supply industry, adding potentially tremendous cost.

116 2018-04-26 15:39:06 Mr. Kenny - I back your stance in getting oil to mrkt to rid the monopsony the US has on us. But, we can't make assumptions on rail ops. It IS more dangerous to ship via rail but the logjam refers to oil glut and not necessarily logjam of other commodities on the rail system.

233 2018-04-26 07:10:49 Non-core asset classes are usually narrowly focused areas within a core asset class: EX: Gold is a part of the commodities group & a non-core asset class.
234 2018-04-26 07:07:24 1. Stocks
2. Bonds
3. Real Estate
4. Commodities 
5. Cash  

(These are the 5 core or main asset classes.)

238 2018-04-26 06:25:44 If govt start giving price equal to MSP to farmers then the end price of all the commodities will go sky rocket high.

240 2018-04-26 06:07:16 Comments here have missed the point.

I can't think of another way - unless all basic living commodities are provided free (food, housing, water, power, etc). 

UBI is not some socialist dream, but a necessity in an automated world where millions of manual jobs will disappear.
241 2018-04-26 05:34:17 It's hilarious reading "I blocked Kanye" tweets by young Liberals. They are sooooo lost n clueless. They are sheeps that Elite Libs slaughter. Just commodities for consumption. The Libs are evil people. But of course if you try to save these young Libs, they say that the Right is
242 2018-04-26 05:28:05 @GST_Council @FinMinIndia @arunjaitley @adhia03 .With GST a revolution in the industry, we support the new taxation system but for some essential commodities like mixer grinders, iron boxes & immersion heaters which are essential for a household need to be brought from 28 to 12%.
243 2018-04-26 05:23:06 @GST_Council @FinMinIndia @adhia03 @arunjaitley ..We are struggling from almost 1 year from 28% gst rate on mixer grinder, iron box and immersion heaters which are essential commodities in every home. Pls consider our request and put them into 12%. We support ur GST taxation.
244 2018-04-26 05:18:37 The biggest acheivement of Modisarkar is

250 2018-04-26 04:29:33 Agree for the most part & would've stayed clear of Hendricks in the past, but his changeup is a knockout pitch and he found pitch mix 2H last year that resulted in 22.7% K & 8.37 K/9. Potential K upside, coupled w/ elite ERA, solid WHIP (scarce commodities) makes it palatable

255 2018-04-26 03:04:13 I love the phrase North Indian imports. As if NI’s are commodities like sardines and fishes? This is the kind of respect a constitutionally elected representative have for fellow citizens?

258 2018-04-26 02:41:53 Earlier politics used to control money and now money controlling politics. She is right press, judiciary and elections have been reduced to commodities highest bidder can buy. This commodification is destroying our societies and producing inequalities at dangerous level.

260 2018-04-26 02:33:39 Jesus, dude. Get a grip. You have to look at them as commodities. It sucks but its the cap world. And I agree, it is stupid to draft a player 4th and not resign him...which is why drafting a RB 4th is dumb

262 2018-04-26 02:26:43 What "global cyclical downturn" are they talking about? Commodities are one of the top performers in 2018.
263 2018-04-26 02:22:04 Yeah, there's a lot of that going around these days. People with Big Souls who sell themselves cheap as commodities.
264 2018-04-26 02:15:34 The proliferate of choice (usually of commodities) is often seen as the proliferation of freedom, but choice is not freedom. And freedom is not a stack you add to.
265 2018-04-26 02:13:33 The problem is UX. They are all commodities, but the experience sets them apart. Sadly, Google Finance’s new version is horrible, scottrade was acquired by TDameritrade.
266 2018-04-26 02:12:12 Truth is a luxury. Facts are commodities. It's a seller's market.

274 2018-04-26 01:07:26 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.
275 2018-04-26 01:04:58 Most peoples tax cut now going to pay for gas hikes, 40 cents a gallon over the last 6 weeks. Next food prices, clothing and other commodities will rise because of fuel cost. So nothing gained and a lot lost.
276 2018-04-26 01:04:28 some things off the top of my head: bureaucracy (you can’t do anything quickly or online, everything takes a million forms and lots of time), overwork problem, gender inequality, foreigners are treated like commodities (youre their english teacher or a nuisance, no inbetween)

283 2018-04-26 00:19:55 So let's get nuanced about nationalism and the anarchist cause. To be sure, integral nationalism is always (and I mean FUCKING ALWAYS) terrible. To rally behind the state, the fatherland, and commodities for no reason other than some abstract connection is reactionary nonsense.
