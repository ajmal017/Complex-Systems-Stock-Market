38 2018-07-08 20:58:23 Yeah, for TX (and all commodities extraction locations) it's really dumb. No Q there, unless maybe they could declare corp profits in another state/country.
39 2018-07-08 20:55:10 With enough MONEY you don’t have to bother unlocking closed doors, you can just create new doors and pathways to the commodities.  ABUNDANCE for the masses will not create “Inflation.” #tpesa
40 2018-07-08 20:55:04 Yep, def related. & I think we underestimate how important the monetary policy response to stagflation was: to slow the economy as soon as labor markets got warm. I think all of these things (exchange rates, commodities prices, stagflation, monetary policy) go together.
41 2018-07-08 20:48:20 Y colombia tiene ingresos por commodities que no tiene Costa Rica. Así que debería gastar más. Ufff no. Es terrible eso
42 2018-07-08 20:41:44 And formula is still a product, not a natural resource.  It requires an infrastructure and agricultural commodities and packaging.
43 2018-07-08 20:37:11 O boom das commodities acabou em 2008, não em 2015.
44 2018-07-08 20:23:18 E esse aumento das commodities construiu universidades, criou programas sociais, levou alimento pra mesa das pessoas etc né? Mesmo com esses fatores externos se fosse outro presidente (tipo o Temer) os únicos a se beneficiarem dessas commodities seriam os grandes empresários
45 2018-07-08 20:22:42 If the commodities were tradeable why couldn’t they trade them with any of the other 100 nations on Earth?
46 2018-07-08 19:59:29 exportação de commodities, acabou a farra e o brasil voltou ao normal
47 2018-07-08 19:34:52 Although I think all those things are progressive to humanity and need to happen, there are entire groups of people that think more mining, more capitalism of commodities, more guns, more animal ag, etc are “better” for humanity.
48 2018-07-08 19:30:46 That’s fast work! I was going to suggest work by Gavin Bridge on Global Production Networks, also Alex Hughes & Cheryl McEwan on fairtrade. Lots of interesting economic/cultural Geog on commodities these days.
49 2018-07-08 19:11:35 En el año 2005 AdFA (Antes del Frente Amplio) era un atraso. Estábamos profundamente endeudados, llenos de burocracia al pedo , exportabamos commodities, la banca y el comercio exterior extranjerizado, corruptela política, etc.  Pero todo cambió.Ahora estamos peor 
50 2018-07-08 19:11:08 Jubilee legacy is far paper words than assuring the hope of Kenyans too unfortunate now Kenyans are Hungary, are screened to verify as citizens, live in limbo, put hostage at hospitals for bills, skyrocketing of commodities, rannaway thefts, injustices  #DPRutoOnNTV

53 2018-07-08 18:56:13 Women are not commodities
54 2018-07-08 18:48:38 I program in APL array language whose market is complex financial applications . I've long said I wouldn't think of trading commodities w/o a supercomputer .

But Hayek pointed out no central model can have the intrinsically distributed info individuals use to make their choices
55 2018-07-08 18:41:15 American farm subsidies are egregiously expensive, harvesting $20 billion a year from taxpayers’ pockets. Most of the money goes to big, rich farmers producing staple commodities such as corn and soyabeans in states such as Iowa.
56 2018-07-08 18:37:48 Most commodities decay, or can be destroyed easily. Precious metals are money, because they are extremely durable. They're in a whole different category. You'll never see a usable coin made of soybeans
57 2018-07-08 18:34:45 Their are 5 major asset classes. Stocks, bonds, real estate, commodities and cash. What do you invest in?

61 2018-07-08 18:13:17 Pero ¿Cómo co#%*% vas a hacer commodities sin hedging? Eso es el Circo del Sol. ¡Ah, y si! la cobertura perfecta no existe.

63 2018-07-08 18:11:50 I thought women were our equals, now l hear they are commodities that can be bought at the market.
64 2018-07-08 18:07:54 @PMOIndia Sir to run medical store one needs pharmacist then how ur gov't allows medicine to be sold online like other commodities. It's against code of ethics. Stop it or else remove law of pharmacist.
65 2018-07-08 18:01:57 You’re not a very bright professor if you think tariffs on global commodities like soybeans will have a lasting effect. Beans do not have a made in the USA label on them. They will simply be re-routed and sold elsewhere.
66 2018-07-08 17:58:05 please lets ensure our #intellectualproperty laws are in order..otherwise like our commodities barely belong to us..with spate of foreign investment into African tech even our IP will be lost...I am not saying its not good I am just saying let's tighten up.
67 2018-07-08 17:55:23 Your "social influence" has been commodified,  and a consolidation of commodities is at its core in direct opposition to the tenets of leftist ideals
68 2018-07-08 17:34:28 Colorado River has only reached the sea 1x in past 2 decades. It's an important delivery system of nitrogen to upper estaurine systems. River is diverted largely to support tourism in Vegas, and luxury agri commodities such as almond production in SW US.
69 2018-07-08 17:27:25 I still don’t get how the idea of loans is so normalized in the Lebanese society to the least needed commodities
70 2018-07-08 17:25:02 Haha its not about treating you as commodities, its just a fact lol nothing personal
71 2018-07-08 17:23:56 Adorei o " craque commodities" sensacional e adequadíssimo o termo! É o que temos na selecção brasileira.
72 2018-07-08 17:17:04 Something disturbingly denigrating about this tweet. Can y'all stop this thing of treating us as commodities. Sexism makes me sick  
73 2018-07-08 17:15:53 As long as animals are seen as commodities, instead of as individuals, abuse is inevitable.  Please, RT and encourage everyone you know to NEVER wear animals!
74 2018-07-08 17:10:05 Cyclical behavior in the commodity markets seems to have shortened over recent years. An overall bull market developed in 2003 and lasted until 2011/2012. The following four-year bear market seems to have come to an end with many commodities finding bottoms in early 2016.
75 2018-07-08 16:54:44 We know enough of Tangatanga unfulfilled promises, please concentrate on his wealth, net worth, land issues, and contraband commodities: then you tell him that Kikuyu's doesn't owe him any debts,  kama ni deni then RAO alipwee wa kwanza

77 2018-07-08 16:45:42 What about warning of moving to mountains due to unaffordable commodities? Should sound familiar.
78 2018-07-08 16:44:51 IMO, Labour is still required to create the value of commodities and must form a key part of any analysis of society. However, I agree the simultaneous blurring of social & private wages and creation of precariat mean organisation must happen outside the workplace as well.
79 2018-07-08 16:42:38 Also problem with all these is that, as accountants/commodities brokers get involved with brewing process, beers are at the whim of the hop alpha market. If you notice, the bitterness in all these changes between smooth and soapy depending on what cultivars are cheapest and when.
80 2018-07-08 16:35:21 If we form a cartel, and able to control prices, we will gain more but still have only 5% of the market value. Same with other commodities, oil inclusive. We need to look beyond commodity export and start building industries to gain from the value chain
81 2018-07-08 16:18:59 Lula não foi um bom presidente. Ele pegou um momento econômico extremamente favorável com a China e resto do mundo comprando nossas Commodities...
82 2018-07-08 16:04:50 I should. I could not understand how the Kenyan worker affords to buy basic commodities at U.S prices but on a Burundi salary
83 2018-07-08 15:59:28 2/2 los 100 m de Pib tiene mucho que ver con el super ciclo de los commodities. Si se distribuyo riqueza no lo puedo negar  hay q ser objetivo. El proyecto empezo con buenas intenciones pero se degenero en division social, ego y gastos muy elevados que no podemos pagar.
84 2018-07-08 15:58:37 Physicalness is NOT what I said. Resources/commodities is what I said. If there is a value for something non physical then it will have some type of tangible backing in a human lifetime if it wants to REMAIN sound money.
85 2018-07-08 15:46:49 ag commodities have to participate in next move of inflation to detach from crude based inflationary pressures only....
86 2018-07-08 15:45:56 humans have victimized animals to such a degree, that they aren’t even considered victims. They aren’t even considered at all. They’re nothing. They don’t count, they don’t matter, they’re commodities like TV sets and cellphones.
87 2018-07-08 15:31:57 This makes no sense. Right now, cryptocurrency is backed by FIAT. If we can just take the fiat that is backed by actual available resources and commodities, then THAT is sound money. When we start adding invented debt and fractional reserve created fiat. Just as worthless.
88 2018-07-08 15:09:14 The way some ladies use their bodies as commodities these days, it's scary. Man don't know who to marry again. God help us
89 2018-07-08 14:57:43 The hottest of all of the trade commodities.
90 2018-07-08 14:47:53 People's lives are not commodities.. Sorry lady
91 2018-07-08 14:24:31 Yep. The farmer who raises pigs works his ass off, but makes a fraction of the money the commodities broker makes buying/selling pork belly futures.
92 2018-07-08 14:19:48 @hd_kumaraswamy FARMERS PRODUCE TO BANK AND SELL AT HIGHER RATE TO PURCHASE PADDY AND OTHER COMMODITIES     . WE CAN EASILY SOLVE THE PROBLEM IN EASIEST WAY
93 2018-07-08 14:18:42 Shut it all down 

Provide commodities to impoverished so they can eat 

No cash - NONE

This is an insane program that is so defrauded it’s difficult to explain how bad it is...
94 2018-07-08 14:10:04 Greater investments in #humanitarian settings means  access to life-saving services & commodities for women, children & adolescents.
#EWECisME
95 2018-07-08 14:02:00 Events are now commodities to be owned, rather than  enjoyed as a spectacle. It's about being there as status, rather than watching for enjoyment. Also, how can we be sure this chap's reaction is genuine, since it's premeditated for the purposes of filming himself.
96 2018-07-08 13:48:23 Great move sir ! Btw does this also include the local art (as in paintings) industry? Local artists are fast becoming hot commodities internationally !
97 2018-07-08 13:45:46 This concerns me a little, the way past regimes have been run, guys like PDG and martinook (known commodities) will block anybody else from getting a chance.
98 2018-07-08 13:35:52 #LegClots, you need to move around every 30 minutes. We have bushrangers here and #NedKelly. Lot of #Commodities, like #Gold, #IronOre, #Lithium. Tweet limit is 280 #Letters and #Numerals. Maybe, I should send you a link
99 2018-07-08 13:33:58 Fears about securely buying domains with Bitcoins are a red herring. It’s easy to trade Bitcoins for other non-reputable commodities.
100 2018-07-08 13:20:05 Until Malawi legalizes one of the most wanted commodities in the world popularly known as MALAWI GOLD it's safe to say Malawi is a childish country run by grannies
101 2018-07-08 13:16:53 OK. But my point was that, had Japan entered world markets in, say, 1820, as a land-poor country it would have struggled as ToT favoured commodities producers until 1860. It may have found itself with a smaller gold cushion to finance early modernization.
102 2018-07-08 13:08:18 É o reflexo do nosso capitalismo da miséria também no futebol. Jogador no Brasil virou Commodities, vai jovem para o exterior onde é lapidado e se torna um produto pronto com alto valor agregado. Depois de depreciado ao longo do tempo volta para o Brasil para encerrar carreira.
103 2018-07-08 13:04:11 In achche din of modiji Living cost too high due to high price of commodities,petrol, diesel ,lpg,services etc
104 2018-07-08 13:00:40 I'm confused. Doesn't it mean that it entered world markets as ToT favoured commodities importers such as Japan, for the first time in decades?  Maybe you don't consider J as industrial power before 20s?
105 2018-07-08 12:57:43 Vice President, Structured Commodities Finance Switzerland.. Read More here.....
106 2018-07-08 12:56:18 People are not parasites or commodities. “The state” is made up of people, it’s not a an entity people can”suck life out of.” Have a nice day.
107 2018-07-08 12:51:50 3 is not important & 1 is just false: Japan entered world markets when its ToT improved massively. Japan’s lucky breaks were that it was land-poor & labour-abundant & didn’t have that many primary commodities to export (silk cocoons and green tea were the 2 big primary exports)
108 2018-07-08 12:48:47 Sorry, Dan. Not a commodities guy. I've looped in @HalftimeReport @CNBCFuturesNow to see if they can pick up your question on the show sometime this week. Happy investing!
109 2018-07-08 12:32:17 @TwoRivers_KE creates employment,promotes Kenyan economy, accessibility of commodities...now they are growing local talents... what can't you guys do apart from paying our taxes 
110 2018-07-08 12:26:41 Supply is tight and not really improving anywhere else. Demand has been stronger than predicted every year for at least five years.
Investor/market sentiment has been crazy low, and just moving back to "you should allocate SOMETHING to E&P and commodities" gets us to $100 - easy.
111 2018-07-08 12:24:20 A sequence of price hike of different commodities during election time shows to give hard time to caretakers & pressurise public. All these from favourite of past regims.Kind of political blackmailing of corrupts.
112 2018-07-08 12:21:47 All of them are enabling a person who is not fit to lead!!  If he couldn’t take care of our most precious commodities (our children) when needed, he surly can’t take care of our Great Country!!!

114 2018-07-08 11:50:26 Is it time govts. started to back up their currencies with commodities and digital assets?
115 2018-07-08 11:50:22 man, that's an serious waste of fermented liquid grains. 
imagine england and france having an 100 yrs war over grains among other issues, or roman emperors doing deals with egypt for those precious commodities.
116 2018-07-08 11:48:37 Thanks for such a huge response to this message, but everybody is trying to miss the point that women all over the world are exploited for what they are and used and abused in various industries such as advertising to sell commodities by displaying the bodies.
This disrespectful
117 2018-07-08 11:37:03 @CNNThisJustIn ,@bbc brutal system of capitasim, which breeds egoistic, inhuman character in #USA, which pretends to be a leader in human rights. I want to plead to the peace loving American people not to allow their government to treat fellow human beings like commodities
118 2018-07-08 11:16:23 No olvidar que hubo un enorme ingreso de capitales del exterior y distorsiono los precios, en estos 3 años, commodities suben, energéticas cuestionadas, las bancarias y las relacionadas con el agro serían el objetivo.
119 2018-07-08 11:06:24 Had a great jurisprudence tutor who was clearly a keen marxist - you've not lived til you've heard the phrase "fetishisation of commodities" in a Geordie accent.
120 2018-07-08 10:57:17 @BitTradr isn't that the same for all commodities??
121 2018-07-08 10:57:05 Farm animal protection would, for me, ultimately mean the cessation of them being used as commodities.

Oil,Soy beans,Whiskey,etc.
Price hike= inflation, overproduction,

130 2018-07-08 10:19:34 Such misogynistic view. When did women become commodities that go to the highest bidders?

Trump does not understand what it takes,
To cover 2 million Crude barrel a day, to market.
Short Price hike,long over production & possible collapse.

138 2018-07-08 09:59:02 Is tracking the supply chain such a problem? Roll out blockchain faster. Many commodities now need to be shown at every step of the supply chain from mine to end-product. Yes it's difficult but not insurmountable. Many US companies are leading the way - Apple, Tesla, Intel.
139 2018-07-08 09:33:04 Leverage trading could be synonymous to perpetual swaps trading. @idap_io offering includes perpetual swaps for major cryptocurrencies, equity indices, FX, stocks and commodities with leverage up to 50X.

140 2018-07-08 09:30:35 Textiles is a quota driven sector where countries like Bangladesh and Taiwan have a bigger quota whereas commodities respond to short term movements quickly. A statistical test can confirm.

145 2018-07-08 07:51:33 Where is one tax ?
Income tax has different slabs.
GST has different slabs.
Petrol &  diesel different rates in different states
Commodities different rates in different markets
Elections on different dates.
College fees different rates.
Hotel rent different rates.
Where is 'one'

147 2018-07-08 07:25:42 Drugs do not relax you, they turn you into a consumptive addict who relies on commodities to remain socially functional.
148 2018-07-08 07:25:09 You should probably remember what the MeToo movement was in reaction to. Decades of powerful old men like Cosby, Weinstein & Trump treating women any way they wanted, treating women like... commodities. Telling their stories is how these women pushed back

152 2018-07-08 06:43:44 Trump and Wilbur Ross are probably shorting the commodities & futures market.
153 2018-07-08 06:29:35 Do you expect a backlash at some point, driving investors back to Gold and other commodities?
154 2018-07-08 06:20:13 I came across an article that did an analysis of other commodities, and whether CME trading had any effect on the spot price and found... it has very little impact on short-term pricing, and no impact on long term pricing.
155 2018-07-08 06:12:14 I wonder under whose dilligent watch did industries collapse that we ended up importing basic commodities, is it not bad policies like price fixing,fixed exchange rates leading to black markets almost similar to the Bond fallacy
156 2018-07-08 06:04:19 Lots of commodities exhibit centralized ownership. For example diamonds, oil, etc. Not sufficient to be classified as a security. Incidentally 97% of BTC is controlled by 4% of BTC addresses. No one knows who owns most of them--could be 95% one party for all you know.
157 2018-07-08 06:03:53 State ownership of all is a big fat NO!!!!! State ownership of basic "right to life" commodities (water, power, roads) yes, universal healthcare yes, simple fair taxation with the cuts and reductions from the bottom up, not TOP down? HELL YES!
158 2018-07-08 05:55:15 There will be no compromise on Minimum wage to ₹350 per day.... If you will not fulfill that... then be ready to face the wrath of voters in the tea belt in the upcoming elections..... ₹30 hike is not enough now when inflation is very high and prices of commodities are high.
159 2018-07-08 05:49:58 @eikebatista exterior reproduz uma dinâmica histórica: o Brasil exporta commodities e importa manufaturados. Os chineses compram produtos como minério de ferro, açúcar, celulose, carne bovina e de frango. Mas a soja é a principal mercadoria brasileira vendida para a China:
160 2018-07-08 05:35:09 Equating obsolete tech. with bureaucrat/politician-contrived shut-downs and hostile lawfare against targeted commodities and industry.  Cynical and despicable

If "coal isn't coming back," it will be markets that decide, not two-bit, control-freak "environmentalist" pols like Ted
161 2018-07-08 05:07:27 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.
162 2018-07-08 04:41:45 Are they readily available like commodities in the market?
163 2018-07-08 04:23:30 the point was not drinking milk tea but to encourage the same hype for taho that coco is receiving. It helps local vendors who needs the income more given the spike in prices of basic commodities.  You can drink both naman, hun. =)
164 2018-07-08 04:12:27 Me: Krotopkin observed that many valuable commodities are destoried to keep the price artificially high and much labor is wasted maintaining the illusion of scarcity. 
Also Me: a 200$ shoe is good value for money cause menswear markets have less turn over.
165 2018-07-08 04:07:40 Obama and the Dems broke what we had and we watched good Drs leave their practices and our hospitals sold to corporations. Now we are only commodities and 20 min time slots. @LeslieCockburn Tim Kaine  wants to finish us off with single payer socialized system. #VA05
166 2018-07-08 03:54:56 This Tariff BS is just that. BS. Taxes for each government? Trump had the balls to suggest NO tariffs. Stock market isn’t in the tank. This incredible man knows what he’s doing.  We need for naught. This nation is self sufficient and our commodities are in high demand. #MAGA.
167 2018-07-08 03:35:05 The subsidy covers the difference in prices between sales commodities, and often helps support crops during low/no-yield years. But there's a certain irony to the recipients bitching about others on welfare as though their situation isn't government fall-back.
168 2018-07-08 03:08:48 Sprott is a good outfit. The only slight problem I have with their philosophy is that they over emphasize how good regular commodities will do in a stagnating inflationary world economy.
169 2018-07-08 03:06:20 They don’t own cars but they eat . When price of fuel raises price of commodities do as well.
170 2018-07-08 02:59:55 You are missing the import quotas or trfs.
Most commodities fall well under limits
171 2018-07-08 02:50:27 Attack on Titan came around at a particular time, when Zombies (Walking Dead) and Brutal Nihilistic Fantasy (Game of Thrones) were hot commodities. I can almost understand AoT's weirder aspects not registering as such at the time.

173 2018-07-08 02:14:24 Socialism properly defined involves state intervention or control in the economic system. It isn't about roads or schools or hospitals or pensions. It's about commodities, capital, labor, prices, production etc.
174 2018-07-08 02:12:30 Hahahaha! There is a domino effect if you raise interest rate. Price of commodities will also rise. Price of fuel and gas will also rise. Everything will rise. That is the main reason why Central Bank doesn't want to increase interest rate

176 2018-07-08 01:34:37 El ciclo de alza de commodities va primero con un alza del cobre y posterior depreciación del dólar a nivel mundial. Continúa con fuerte alza de los metales en gral, oil y termina con los agrícolas. Podemos llegar a tener un escenario de subas de tasas con un dxy bajando.
177 2018-07-08 01:30:03 Coffee sales must have been lagging, be ready for the drop!

Same with all these cycles like pistachios, coconut ect ect.  A group out there has a sweet gig hyping commodities on a constant cycle.
178 2018-07-08 01:29:48 I'll bet they don't. These 81 children are nothing more than commodities to this 'charity' that's taking American taxpayers to the cleaners.
179 2018-07-08 01:27:22 Entonces cuando hay apreciación del dólar aumentan los precios de los commodities? No es un precio que varía según oferta-demanda?
180 2018-07-08 01:07:17 @Robintenhaaf Misschien iets voor jou ik heb zelf geen mogelijkheid meer deze maanden erin te stappen. ik moet sparen vanuit mijn reguliere werk, koffie een van de grootste commodities, boeren hebben geen bestaansrecht meer door lage prijzen Een mooie Bullish engulving na jaren !
181 2018-07-08 01:06:20 The more you consume, the less you live. Commodities are the opium of the people.
182 2018-07-08 01:04:58 As president, you should be made aware that the uranium in question wasn't weaponizable and is, in fact, sold on the commodities markets. Are you lying or just uninformed?
183 2018-07-08 01:02:33 Anyway sorry for sounding like a know it all, my family deals in commodities. I don't believe in tarrifs between developed nations. It's good for growing industry but I don't believe in protectionism.
184 2018-07-08 00:58:35 Power play with Protectionism: We evolved over centuries with trade of knowledege, culture and commodities. Now, we want to close doors probably to relish what we achieved so far.
185 2018-07-08 00:58:09 Capitalism is good up to a point, then it becomes harmful to us. We've created monsters that are harming us. Oil companies and the investment firms that prop up the price in the commodities market are the worst offenders. They are dangerous to our economy and harm it the most.
186 2018-07-08 00:55:34 Why talk about God? Why not talk about inflation, deteriorating peso, high prices of commodities and budgrt deficit..and how to solve it?

191 2018-07-08 00:25:06 I have to say, I'm seeing an awful lot of bargains in the stock market lately. A lot of truly hated sectors out there. Multiples are REALLY contracted in energy, commodities, metals, industrials...everything except tech.
192 2018-07-08 00:18:36 Some govt power wielders might steal the money of ‘faceless’ people. It is more heartless to steal basic commodities from ordinary citizens whose resources may just be as constrained as the thief’s.

234 2018-07-07 21:25:41 Their argument for Centre is that they have to but the 'big names' & 'know commodities' on it. Novak(as much as it pains me to say), Delpo, Angie & Penko are all GS champs AND crowd favourites, it makes no sense to me! (This has really annoyed me tonight!)
235 2018-07-07 21:20:21 Yes we need to do that for all commodities Coca in West Africa, Coffee & tea in East Africa and copper in Zambia and diamond in Congo. How come multinational firms making all this huge profits when our African farmers is still struggling with basics.

238 2018-07-07 21:01:01 I wouldn't go that far, but I'll agree to a certain degree. Problem is that even when employers get bad reps, there will always be people they can take adv of. People are not disposable commodities, employers should be accountable.
239 2018-07-07 20:44:39 Japan I think had two things going for it. It had a lot of state capacity, which meant it could absorb knowledge and reorganize society much more effectively. It also didn’t have enough desirable commodities to make conquest and sabotage worthwhile for European powers.
240 2018-07-07 20:33:46 Does anyone know what pollution and carbon credit commodities on wallstreet are? Grab  barf  bag and look up this sh*t guys. #maga they call themselves environnetalists?  Crooks! #MAGA

244 2018-07-07 19:44:16 Same with commodities and in the old ages when people when they used to trade grains, salt, saffron...is all based on supply and demand generation
245 2018-07-07 19:28:15 Yes, and with as much money as has been printed worldwide causing massive asset inflation makes me wonder why commodities are so stuck
246 2018-07-07 19:25:38 that’s why, right now, I’m short dollar.  The dollar bull is yet to emerge.  Right now, Commodities up, dollar down.  As EU begins to normalize and QT continues in 2019, this relative effect will diminish, US will steepen, and that’s when the $ will rally.  #IMHO
247 2018-07-07 19:10:38 @FoxNews Trump is manipulating certain commodities on the stock market and Ivanka and Jared Kushner are cashing in...it's basically insider trading from within the Oval Office.  And Robert Mueller is watching

252 2018-07-07 19:02:49 With all the talk about inflation, commodities x-oil, gold & silver dont seem to be foretelling it
253 2018-07-07 18:54:46 It's only when you are truly broke that you get to learn the actual prices of commodities.
254 2018-07-07 18:36:28 Además vos estas diciendo que la Argentina se infló por los precios de los commodities, entonces calculo que al bajar el precio automáticamente bajó el PBI, no?
255 2018-07-07 18:34:41 Meaning that they're the only country to have certain commodities. Being that they would overwhelming have they commodity vs others, means that they could literally shut down factories in other countries by adjusting their price. They would be the only ones left w/ that commodity
256 2018-07-07 18:31:13 True gardens and gardening are becoming rare commodities 
257 2018-07-07 18:28:01 And yet Trump is asking farmers to be patriots and lose their livelihoods in the name of his trade tariffs. No doubt he is gaming the commodities market with Mnuchin and Wilbur Ross.
258 2018-07-07 18:15:51 You do realize that other countries are making/have made arrangements for their commodities, right?  Even if the rhetoric changes the loss of future business already happened.
259 2018-07-07 17:53:07 Opening Salvo's between U.S. and China have no effect on Farm commodities, expecting massive Farm commodity boom, finally the American Farmer gets a fair shake on the international market. #MAGA
260 2018-07-07 17:44:51 Ok Mr. Economist, let’s monitor for avg 30% inflation on common commodities and all gov. bank should shutdown. Ok?
261 2018-07-07 17:43:19 As a dem I believe worst pres is Bill Clinton. He backed crime bill, telecom bill which gave us 6 media giants, commodities act & didnt stop death of glass steagel which led to 2007 collapse. WORST OF ALL HE DESTROYED THE DEM PARTY-GAVE IT TO RICH AND ABANDONED POOR & MID CLASS

266 2018-07-07 17:25:36 Encima pasó el 2001, nos doran la píldora, el boom de las commodities que no fue mérito de ningun gobierno se convirtió en la excusa para el efecto derrame que sólo el campo tiene que hacer. Se lo decis a los periodistas, le escribimos directo a Bercovich por el tema.
267 2018-07-07 17:23:50 675,000 hours is the average life span of a Human.  I have used around 339,000 so far.  I have been told twice in my life to calm down about others wasting my time.  Moments in time, life experiences, relationships, etc. Those are the commodities I trade in.  You should also....
268 2018-07-07 17:18:37 @AmyGore3 I agree with you that BPS has been under funded, which leaves the door open for groups like @EdVestors  to step in feeling as though they are Supermen, and they do treat our children like commodities. Which Parents must stop
269 2018-07-07 17:17:29 Fears about securely buying domains with Bitcoins are a red herring. It’s easy to trade Bitcoins for other non-reputable commodities.
270 2018-07-07 17:02:29 idk and idc about trade war bs or speculating on how it will effect commodities. stronger usd recently has not meant jack to oil price which everyone wants to short based on COT but keep getting burned. US equities look bullish going into this week so thats where Im focused
271 2018-07-07 16:53:07 I wonder if anyone is checking to see if either Trump or his friends/family are shorting the commodities markets?
272 2018-07-07 16:51:32 If this is your focus, not a chance. U use this 2 distract from tRump policies that will adversely affect GDP, health care costs, drug costs, rising commodities, inflationary tends, cuts 2 Medicare, Medicaid, & Social Security, etc.,& his hiring of foreigners. You Big Dummy.

275 2018-07-07 16:11:23 Kochs will prob put in new farm deal & even increase farm subsidies & fix commodities higher than they have ever been 2 “feed the world” once they have all ground.They claim small govt, but rely on corporate socialism. Small govt 2 Kochs mean Koch Kleptocracy serving mainly Kochs
276 2018-07-07 16:00:42 Meu pai trabalha nessa área e com agrotóxico, posso falar uma coisa, não é viável produzir em larga escala qualquer tipo de produtos sem agrotóxico, se for em pequena e com seleção das sementes até vai, mais para ser commodities nunca serão.
277 2018-07-07 16:00:15 @eikebatista A Embraer foi alardeada por sucessivos governos com uma prova de que o Brasil é capaz de produzir mais do que commodities (sem demérito para a tecnologia empregada nas lavouras de soja) e competir com as potências globais. Tornou-se um orgulho nacional.

281 2018-07-07 15:35:39 Being different isn't about doing what other people are doing do better than they do it. It's about doing what they are not doing at all.
If you don't separate by this much you're just a commodity. 
And commodities get crushed.
Micheal Burt
282 2018-07-07 15:33:59 I'm sure it exists but it would be interesting to see what govt pays (and has paid) for various commodities vs. what those commodities get in a vibrant and functioning export market.
283 2018-07-07 15:32:58 How so? It's not just true of people who eat meat, but people who consume lots of commodities. But it's particularly true of a substantial portion of the consumer base for meat. You may have no problem with "dropping" a cow (as you once said, I believe) but many consumers do
284 2018-07-07 15:30:11 Are cats and dogs commodities
285 2018-07-07 15:28:03 Interactive is a good direction. We have tech people nearby but we need cash, big cash from all commodities to get this in place. Canadian based Museums, nature walks & Royal Botanical have them People get the facts immediately in short lines.
286 2018-07-07 15:11:46 If that’s your view,  Buy the industrials that have been beaten down of late. Look at machinery stocks in particular. Also would consider ag commodities like soybeans.
287 2018-07-07 15:05:14 This is widely true of many commodities we use isn't it? From rare earths to palm oil. None of the local consequences are based on morality just profit.
288 2018-07-07 15:03:30 You do know that FoM isn't a system of immigration, but a system of reciprocal rights?
Obviously you don't know what any of it means.
Leave voters should be treated as commodities everywhere outside the UK, and if they're unemployed in UK they're banned from looking abroad.

295 2018-07-07 14:20:55 Who hurt White immigrant ancestors?  They were all given affordable housing, a job, and commodities for survival.  Then in a few generations some became millionaires.  Kennedy, Roosevelt, Hilton, Koch, Trump . . . these families ALL were once immigrants.
296 2018-07-07 14:14:04 Keep in mind that 3 month outlook still allows those utilizing the Playbook to profit, but from using the Investor Trend suggestions vs the Trader Trend suggestions for US equity trades. Trader Trend would still apply to bonds, international and commodities.
297 2018-07-07 14:07:41 Kidnapping is a crime. We are more than kidnapping we are stealing. We grab the kids, are unable to identify their parents, and put them out as commodities in the private prison trade.

We are using them for profit. We are in the business of slavery.

299 2018-07-07 13:51:16 Most employer 401k packages push mediocre funds that exist to harvest fees, not to make you money.  Discount Brokers should offer 401k packages directly so savers/investors could have a larger selection, cds, bonds, stocks, commodities, and funds.  No limits.

@realDonaldTrump is winning.

German car makers want to eliminate tariffs.   Under EU rules, this would mean that more nations would also have their tariffs eliminated

Plus commodities are oversold!  Trade war?

 Not so concerned about millions of babies literally ripped from their mamas womb in your support of PP, are you? Hmm.... Using children as politically expedient commodities...Hypocrisy and evil....the hallmark of the Democrat party.
307 2018-07-07 11:51:24 Finally it sounds like Warner Bros. is embracing a counter-programming strategy of stand-alones that differs from Marvel. This is the route they should have taken from the jump. Creative filmmaker-driven genre films will be hot commodities for both audiences and directors. #DCEU
308 2018-07-07 11:49:44 There's a fear that Buhari might win the next election or what might be the fate of Nigerians if he wins. Will the price of commodities decrease, will the corruption  fight  be fairly fought?  This is what is driving some to get their PVC. In politics fear comes before hope.

315 2018-07-07 11:02:03 You always criticized the hike in petrol/diesel prices saying any hike in fuel prices will result in rise in prices of the essential commodities. Now your govt in Karnataka has imposed a rise in taxes on petrol/diesel by Rs 1.15. So your opposition to fuel price was political.
316 2018-07-07 10:51:00 Enjoy kazee ! What a bet ! Women are now commodities.
317 2018-07-07 10:46:11 I to am sorry for your loss. But your story, like others makes me ashamed of what our country is becoming. Disgusting treatment. Humans are commodities to our government, not people.
318 2018-07-07 10:45:28 Why should i sanitise theft of the ballot by ED and company? @edmnangagwa please sort out cash crisis out there. Are you even aware prices of commodities are going up daily  Before the coup eggs were $4,50. - $5. We are at $7-$8 as today.
319 2018-07-07 10:30:42 America, I learnt is the largest exporter of agricultural produce- beaf inclusive. How did they do that by ranching? How did they succeed without open grazing? Why is food one of the cheapest commodities in the USA? Asking the right questions​, takes us closer to the Truth
320 2018-07-07 10:25:25 When sth is not giving back the intended ROI, you pull your money and put it somewhere it has a better chance of doing so, be it cash,commodities or even a riskier investment as bitcoin.
Besides when people lose money their risk appetite increases.

People also don’t want to have too much money in the bank, we all know the recent collapses. 

I think it will be a flip.

326 2018-07-07 08:51:59 In other words, it takes more people to grow the food, but you get more of it per hectare. Yes, we'll need bulk commodities too, but what is to be feared from a polycultured farm landscape in some fertile areas, producing a high yield of many different crops?

336 2018-07-07 07:01:26 You can store soybeans for up to 2 years, & sell anytime the price go up. If you only sell at harvest time, the price would be very low & you would not make profit. I'm thinking you are not into commodities??

341 2018-07-07 06:21:45 Today’s women make themselves sexual commodities because they’re conditioned to believe that doing anything expressly ‘for’ a man, for his ‘pleasure’, is self abasement and against the Strong Independent Woman narrative.

Thus, women have no value-added beyond the sexual.

354 2018-07-07 03:56:58 I guess you didn’t read the story. It is referring to markets for farm commodities; as in China won’t be buying their soybeans from the US. Also Mexico will be buying all its corn next year from Argentina. Farmers are screwed because Trump doesn’t understand world economies.
355 2018-07-07 03:55:31 The Government should also focus on strengthening the weak peso while at the same time, controlling and preventing the rising inflation on the prices of basic commodities from sky-rocketing further as for both not to affect the growth of our economy as well as its resiliency.
356 2018-07-07 03:35:27 No entiendo. Los commodities son mercancias, un grano de arroz e.g. sería un commodity grande o chico?
357 2018-07-07 03:34:24 Imagine a pool but instead of water the pool holds oil, now no matter who sucks out the oil, the supplies go down. Generally commodities behave like that.
358 2018-07-07 03:20:10 Meron nmn 300 pesos /month n tulong pra s mahihirap  seriously what can you buy with 300? Not enuf to cover increased in prices of commodities 
359 2018-07-07 03:18:18 Also 1) there is no such thing as BTC fair value, as he incorrectly claims based on minimg costs multiplier, and 2) unlike commodities, bitcoin's mining costs can go down sharply if miners leave & difficulty adjusts down - floor can go extremely low.

364 2018-07-07 02:39:27 I love this Russell. But let's be honest, football is too short a lifespan as a career that it makes it harder for you guys to band together and hold the line. In addition, your most important commodities QBs are rarely ever on the front lines for your fight.

369 2018-07-07 01:55:12 Actually, I have a co-worker who's from Ukraine, and still has family there, Ukraine is split between people in the East that would rather Russia gain their sovereignty, while people in the west would rather waste US charity money on commodities than fight back Russia #lostcause

373 2018-07-07 01:23:36 @Mohamme88819167 Humbly Sir... America may be seen as trying to keep China workforce poor in order to keep in-store and online commodities cheap.

379 2018-07-07 00:21:16 American farmers played right into Putin's hands by voting for a nut job that is driving purchasers of soy, corn and other commodities right to Russia giving Putin billions in hard currency.  This was all in the cards between Russia and Trump.  Follow the money folks

381 2018-07-07 00:05:29 Thanks. Much of our economy is based on marketing and selling things that are not

388 2018-07-06 23:23:13 An overwhelming number of commodities, like oil and metals, are priced in greenbacks. If China sold off a batch of Treasury, it would find plenty of buyers
389 2018-07-06 23:14:15 i mean, i've consistently called them scummy, exploitative, and argued against selling art as commodities which is what they do. i've even said that i understand why the original artists do sell their art, so i've differentiated between them.
390 2018-07-06 23:06:39 6/n Unlike commodities required by industries (e.g. Crude Oil) there is very limited "intrinsic" demand for bitcoin. Most demand is for speculative purposes. That makes demand very elastic to supply changes. The more elastic demand is, the less influential supply shocks are.
391 2018-07-06 23:05:31 I'd say commodities to China will be a bigger problem than people think-I base this on the chart for the beginning of the tariff at midnight.

421 2018-07-06 22:08:24 It’s more about the commodities, like American Steel. If it’s made with cheap Asian steel, that’s not properly melted, poured, purified, and mixed with other metals.

439 2018-07-06 20:33:05 Thank you John for your insightful & compassionate advice. £10 of course will buy you a tree, as it will numerous other commodities. However, what are you completely failing to account for is the symbolic & historic value of items, which simply cannot be replaced easily.

441 2018-07-06 20:20:31 Thank you? I’ve read Das Kapital and was referencing the “it’s all commodities” idea (as opposed to goods-vs-commodities) in the tweet you replied to. But don’t get me wrong: as I said, I agree.
442 2018-07-06 20:20:06 All ETFs. We are beta managers. Every asset class & weighting we use have long histories: I know how commodities perform when CPI goes up. What is momentum going to do? Also, the only use I can imagine for multi-factor is vol control-no way to build an alpha case.

459 2018-07-06 19:28:31 ...even though corn and soybean are not commodities, at least not for the end users. This is becoming more and more apparent with new food trends, like non-GMO and organic, but has always existed...
460 2018-07-06 19:27:38 Commoditization/trading/gov: as all of this was happening, policies and trade pushed corn and soy to the level of commodities. Federal policies, like USDA-back crop insurance, and big processing company infrastructure, helped lock this in place...

465 2018-07-06 19:14:51 read through some of the links but wasnt sure if I found the paper. Marxian value of commodities under capitalism = SNLT. Artistic production in almost all instances is not abstract labor (SNLT) and thus is usually exempt, no?
466 2018-07-06 19:14:17 Is that always the best metric? How has what is being represented as “the median home” changed over the time this data took place. Homes aren’t commodities, so if the number and character of the homes being sold changes every year, a lot of weird biases will be in the data
467 2018-07-06 19:14:14 think you are right - cutting corp income tax in an industry where you have a moat = pure gold.  

tariffs on imports raise costs but you can pass some of those costs on.    retaliation hurts if well targeted but China faces challenges there (commodities not ideal targets)
468 2018-07-06 19:13:49 You could at least sell it. Popular accounts are valuable commodities.
469 2018-07-06 19:10:38 The order of the image of a hyperconsumptive civilisation overburdened with commodities and driven to ‘junk’ them ‘to make room for that.
470 2018-07-06 19:03:57 The ability to trade globally and commodities would be great!
471 2018-07-06 19:02:56 Principalmente durante los gobiernos de Lula, cuando Brasil (al igual que Argentina y otros países) tuvieron un fuerte crecimiento de sus economías (gracias a los precios de los commodities). De hecho, Dilma debió aplicar un ajuste bastante severo.
472 2018-07-06 18:59:45 It was a pretty prestigious film school. Excellent professors, but shady AF administration. At least when I went there.

The students were commodities that could easily be replaced.
473 2018-07-06 18:55:24 But then morning starts when u wake up. Good that their trade deficit is reducing. I like china being punished for dumping their products and in between two cats fighting , we can make a killing by getting exports opened up. I heard they opening up to lot of commodities
474 2018-07-06 18:48:51 Indeed! Life is treated as commodities. They are killed for profits. Cows are fed food including meat in Australia, so that they give more beef. (growth hormones) I saw a documentary and I was shocked to know the cruelty of us, humans. Very shameful and disappointing.
475 2018-07-06 18:48:40 A most beautiful day outside and I have not been adequately compensated for that most precious of commodities... time.    #ShameOnMe
476 2018-07-06 18:39:23 The oil decline cycle took about two years to complete. Not a short amount of time. It took place during both a GOP and DNC administration. Presidents have at best very minor influence (via rhetoric) over markets, commodities or the pricing of them.

Idealogues make bad traders.

480 2018-07-06 18:31:08 Why do business people seem to think it's ok to treat geeks like commodities? 

"I love geeks in my fitness group!!!!!"

"I'm running a games n gainz theme next week!"

Yeah like hell you do. You're probably one of those who terrorized us in high school.
481 2018-07-06 18:17:57 “monopolists, by keeping the market constantly understocked, by never fully supplying the effectual demand, sell their commodities much above the natural price, and raise their emoluments, whether they consist in wages or profit, greatly above their natural rate.” -Adam Smith
482 2018-07-06 18:15:19 Your employer is straight up Scum if they want you to work for free. F them saying that you need to work for free. Unpaid internship as an "audition" is just an excuse to exploit and dispose people like commodities. Invest in employees and they will invest back in your company.
483 2018-07-06 18:14:31 SUBSIDIZE OUR FARMERS!! AGRICULTURE DEPT NEEDS 2 PURCHASE THEIR GOODS 4 COMMODITIES 2 FEED POOR, ELDERLY, & DISABLED THRU FOOD BANKS & OTHER PROGRAMS.  @realDonaldTrump
484 2018-07-06 18:13:17 @jimcramer with the Tariff situation could (Health Care/Pharmaceuticals/Biotech be a good defensive sector) with sectors like the Tech & Industrial & Materials & certain Commodities that are a bit more leverage with CHINA markets and probably having some possible IMPACT effect
485 2018-07-06 18:09:22 I didn't like Australia for living, though it was a fun place to visit. Too whinge as a culture, with little innovation on the whole, and small time industry outside of commodities.. fun surfing, diving, hiking... great beer.  Norway was far too dark for me for most of the winter
486 2018-07-06 18:05:30 Damn tell us how you really feel? It’s always funny when a player takes his career into his own hands he seems to be all the mentioned above but when owners underpay; treat players like disposal commodities nothing is said other than “Hey it’s a business decision”

488 2018-07-06 17:50:24 Those kids were stolen, it is hard to believe that was never the intent. Governments want the children as much as the parents. Our offspring are commodities to the future.  Capitalism requires this.
489 2018-07-06 17:49:43 What everyone need to know is, when the cost of transport is high and process frustrating, importers will either cut links or slow down which will mean goods shortage in the country, they’ll pass the cost to consumers. Higher commodities prices. #KillingMombasaEconomy
490 2018-07-06 17:49:13 I think a secondary issue worth considering is the exploitative nature of capitalism itself, where this kind of damage to one's career can literally impede one's ability to access vital commodities like housing and medical care.

506 2018-07-06 17:16:23 The Cult of Trump is so much stronger than any stinking commodities market.  No votes will change.  MAGA !
507 2018-07-06 17:12:15 It's interesting to see the stock markets reaction to the US tariff hike. Still skimming the surface, but it looks like people are bullish on both Chinese and US markets. Perhaps indifferent to the entire thing. Makes little sense to me. Even commodities are slow.
508 2018-07-06 17:10:52 True for stocks. Commodities not so much.
509 2018-07-06 17:07:50 YES!!! Dont you pay Income tax, house tax, property tax, conservancy tax, services tax on commodities, petrol , groceries, mobile ??? Are you exempted?
510 2018-07-06 16:54:16 Have you looked at ‘Sentiment’ trading in commodities? There are market sentiment indices based on social and news stories. Do ppl speculate commodities based on these?

516 2018-07-06 16:29:12 I just follow the prices...  Look at the tariff list, China is putting Tariffs on the stuff they NEED ... food commodities etc.  Then look at what Trump did, stuff we don't need or can get somewhere else... that's how I see it.
517 2018-07-06 16:27:18 Regarding " #TradeWar "... @POTUS @realDonaldTrump needs to use tariffs collected and prop up the commodities market. It's not like it hasn't been done before.

522 2018-07-06 16:12:42 Demand push factor created by this administration's incompetence in looking after basic commodities like sugar, rice, animal feeds. And falling manufacturing output the same time inflation is going up is also not  a sign of healthy "demand".
523 2018-07-06 16:09:05 • Exchange rate flexibility facilitates downward price adjustment of commodities. Improved governance &  investment climate would also enhance growth prospects.

525 2018-07-06 16:02:23 The current standoff between importers and KPA will do the economy more harm than good.

580 2018-07-06 13:30:02 I wonder if the difference in perception has to do with the fact that beets are commodities (i.e. fungible) and games are goods, thus halfway to the bespoke commission that the customer can specify endlessly (but still isn’t always right/practical ofc)

585 2018-07-06 13:26:19 Commodities are very chart oriented & trend is down. I assume bounces are sortable until higher lows followed by higher highs are made... and trend breaks. When that happens, a low is likey in and it can sustainably rise. Commodities go through cycles.

593 2018-07-06 13:11:24 Please explain how this carbon tax drives the economy forward? As I can see it the tax raises the price of all commodities and encourages citizens to make choices between heating/food and (for example) traveling to see this great country.
594 2018-07-06 13:09:07 Doubtful, actually.  Take soybeans, for example.  Commodities traders will tell you that there isn’t enough supply ex US for China to meet its needs.  Whatever they buy from Brazil will have to made up elsewhere.
595 2018-07-06 13:07:41 Really what will you say about supply management when Trump decides to pit dairy farmer against grain/beef farmer and slaps a tariff on grain, beef and other ag commodities?  I really wouldn't be surprised if he did this...
596 2018-07-06 13:06:26 Trump has caused the price of #CrudeOil, #Steel and #Aluminum to go higher, yet they want you to believe that #tradewars are somehow bearish for #Commodities. China the second largest producer after Chile for #Copper. Just need Trump to place tariffs on copper imports next.

Or should we focus more on traditional #Commodities such as #Coal and #CrudeOil ?

692 2018-07-06 04:20:10 Most people on Earth live in a “Poor” country and its even worst for them.  But if you allow people to acquire HUGE wealth quickly, they will find a way to expand the amount of commodities in the world. #tpesa
693 2018-07-06 04:19:42 I can almost see Marx and Engles guiding your writing, as if by some invisible hand. 

It is interesting to note that suppy and demand curves do an ok job at predicting (non securities based) commodities markets, so long as advertising expenses are low.
694 2018-07-06 04:09:10 #TariffReviewKisumu The energy regulator expects industrialists to pass the benefits of lower costs on to consumers in form of cheaper commodities.
695 2018-07-06 03:55:23 Right. But teams should have the right to counterbalance negative influences that try to take commodities they fostered into the existence they enjoy today..
696 2018-07-06 03:51:09 In the end we need a healthcare system responsive to the needs of the community. Through proper financing, bundling of service, improved public facilities, increased human resources, strengthening commodities supply and leadership, we'll get there.
697 2018-07-06 03:46:59 Who cares about a draft pick being top 10 protected? Draft picks are UNKNOWN commodities. Having a Top 10 Pick means NOTHING. Other than Sexton, Thompson is the ONLY top 10 pick here since LeBron was drafted (7 picks)
698 2018-07-06 03:44:00 In addition low cost hospitals like ours @ahavamedke situated in manyatta, Kisumu ought to be considered for subsidies including but not limited to staffing, commodities etc. In the end we are offering the same service
699 2018-07-06 03:37:29 2 best commodities Russia puts out is....Vodka and Prostitutes.
700 2018-07-06 03:26:57 well there are just so many evil commodities out there... video games... antibiotics... car insurance... the list goes on
701 2018-07-06 03:21:03 If you replace money with votes and commodities with parties you will realise that democracy is essentially a market.

We are commodities. We are chattel. #SlideintoSerfdom.

Honor will never return if any GOP have control.
706 2018-07-06 02:59:08 the Depart. of Corrections turned inmates into commodities under Scottand you're ok with it. #stopkillingaddicts
707 2018-07-06 02:58:44 It is not a right. It is a commodity. The difference between rights and commodities is common good and not taking from others and given it to another. You can push policy without saying something is a right.
708 2018-07-06 02:57:12 In the midst of all trade wars, India could be a safe heaven. India is basically domestic oriented economy. Moreover US trade restrictions on China may impact input feeder countries like Malaysia Korea. A slowdown in China and these countries may put pressure on commodities.
709 2018-07-06 02:52:20 Donny doesn't know how commodities markets work. Or anything, for that matter.

Commodities such as milk,meat,vegetables and fruits are becoming scarce. #NMGLeadershipForum
713 2018-07-06 02:32:22 Do you think wealthy neighborhoods deserve priority access to basic commodities over anywhere else? It's fucked that DTE doesn't care being unreliable, but you aren't any more important than the rest of us. We all pay our bills and deserve access to electricity.

716 2018-07-06 02:25:41 i just love how that's in their profile like it isn't a gigantic red flag of "i treat people like commodities to pump up my popularity"
717 2018-07-06 02:19:10 What action has been taken yet when the robbers will sell all the commodities and they will eaisly be escaped then u all will say we tried nothing happened, sir it is a serious concern please look into it with some seriousness,

719 2018-07-06 02:02:34 1/3. La gasolina, como el crudo, tienen un precio determinado por los mercados. Así son todos los "commodities", como el cobre, acero, maíz, plata, etc. A esos precios les debes agregar los costos de traslado, manejo y almacenamiento para abastecer el mercado.
720 2018-07-06 01:50:35 y'all treat people like commodities. & that's fucked up
721 2018-07-06 01:47:36 services like safety and healthcare are not commodities that the rich should only be able to afford. We pay taxes for the police and firemen, why can we not pay taxes to secure healthcare just like safety. Doctors are still paid within a system like that.
722 2018-07-06 01:42:13 Ahora Ministro Hacienda  atribuye gran importancia a impacto contexto internacional (posible guerra comercial, caída precio del cobre, mercados financieros) en la economía nacional. Recuerdo q en gob de MB contexto externo y la caída de precio commodities se trataba de excusa.
723 2018-07-06 01:33:12 2/4 se liberan los precios de la gasolina como en todos los paises desarrollados. No es tan facil bajar el precio de la gasolina, pues la gasolina, como el crudo, tienen un precio determinado por los mercados. Así son todos los "commodities", como el cobre, acero, maíz, etc.
724 2018-07-06 01:30:02 Gold and silver, like other commodities, have an intrinsic value, which is not arbitrary, but is dependent on their scarcity.

726 2018-07-06 01:14:36 different dynamics due to lack of supply. it is a bubble but its built on similar but also different dynamics. Metropolitan Aus Bubble was built on Demand side driven by Commodities Super Cycle followed by low cost debt BUT large Supply prevalent. NZ supply of quality is tight.
727 2018-07-06 01:08:20 This is why you don't spend money on non-attachment commodities, you don't get returns on investment.
728 2018-07-06 00:59:38 Commodities:Chatter that Goldman sees commodities as oversold relative to trade-war.
729 2018-07-06 00:50:32 Spiralling trade tensions between US and its key trading partners  are starting to reshape the market for agricultural commodities.

732 2018-07-06 00:27:13 This is why we need politicians that will stand up for the rights of workers, and not just see the average retail and low income worker as just commodities to be hired and fired .  Stuff like this happens all the time.
733 2018-07-06 00:23:37 ok. so we hit capital cost first, then production costs [labor + commodities]. That leaves us with land. It's the tougher of the 4 primary components.

An idea. It takes state influence. Create a model to pay counties, cities, and schools on a housing density score. Incentives.
734 2018-07-06 00:17:58 E o Brasil dá mais uma das suas poucas empresas de tecnologia de ponta, #Embraer.

Triste. Triste ver q querem que continuemos sendo um exportador de #commodities, invés de um criador de #tecnologia. Que fazemos bem, vide #Petrobrás e #Embraer.
735 2018-07-06 00:17:39 É uma bobagem essa briga de AT e AF !! Uma grande bobagem! Tem de entender as 2 escolas e usar o melhor de ambas? Sempre! Entender dinamica de ciclos economicos, juros, dolar, commodities,inflação. Meu, vc sabe mais que eu. Economia é ciencia social com fundamentacao matemática
736 2018-07-06 00:13:11 Who are also collateral commodities for sale
737 2018-07-06 00:08:12 Watching a doco about the british whaling industry and trying to cut through the bits where they're all "but didn't these people know it was wrong to treat sentient beings as commodities?"
738 2018-07-06 00:03:53 well, whatever--happy tariff day, everyone. may your trade war foxhole be deep and lined with durable commodities
739 2018-07-06 00:00:01 The defendant said Buy Commodities as Clock Ticks Toward Trade War? That's like shouting fire in a crowded theater.
