54 2018-05-19 18:43:42 That said, the farmers has suffered greatly over the last 20 years. It is Corn, soybeans and sorghum that have kept our country from starvation. These commodities feed livestock in our country and what we don’t use we sell to China. At a loss to the farmers I might add.

56 2018-05-19 18:04:51 i feel like that has a lot to do with the intention behind the methods- we are not commodities to throw problem-solvers at, for your own practice's incentives. we are human and require CARE behind the decisions placed upon us.

66 2018-05-19 17:18:01 Yeah i think there is some good interest in commodities. Let me think about what the best way is to do this. Ideas suggestions welcome
67 2018-05-19 17:13:53 It isn't as good as it sounds. They will purchase our commodities instead of another country's.  There won't be a lot more sold. Also, selling a commodity that has a government sponsored safety net is not that great for our country. We need to sell finished goods.
68 2018-05-19 17:11:53 Lovely, it's so reassuring as a Canadian that our PTB have essentially liquidated all our gold. I guess the consolidation prize is the fact Canada has immense reserves of various commodities.
69 2018-05-19 17:05:14 Americans can’t even go to war without Internet and other fancy commodities. I am sorry but the idea of Americans creating a Gun Spring is just absolutely pathetic! Cut the bullshit and solve the guns problems like everyone else did. End them, hard control.

73 2018-05-19 16:42:58 it is absolutely preposterous that under capitalism, basic necessities like food & clean water are treated like commodities instead of THINGS EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO. how anyone can defend a system that allows its own people to starve when food is plentiful is beyond me
74 2018-05-19 16:38:45 And who were the slavers who brought them to Europe and America as commodities to be sold? The vast majority were Zionist!
75 2018-05-19 16:23:59 Coincidence. The early touches are ~15 yrs ago. I don't think the conditions then prevail now. Regarding a possible H&S: commodities oscillate. The neg. target from a H&S would imply a price <= $0. SB is entering seasonal strength for a bounce.

81 2018-05-19 15:57:14 I posted my article on the topic a few weeks ago.  The Who idea of inverse correlation was the result of the 2008-09 crisis:  investors ran away from real estate, financials, and equities, to commodities.  However, the relationship exists in the long run
82 2018-05-19 15:49:32 En 2002 PJ llevó la pobreza al 54%. Después d los mejores precios de commodities de la historia y de poner mega retenciones lo dejaron en 30%. Un desastre fueron. Robaron, quebraron la energía, importación de gas, inflación, cepo. Pero opinan de economía como si llegaran de Suiza
83 2018-05-19 15:45:45 Bem agora tenho certeza que você não sabe o que é investimento, ouro e commodities não são investimento, não pagam juros ou dividendos, também não geram valor por conta própria. O valor das commodities está na procura por ela, e não nela própria.

85 2018-05-19 15:43:50 #KarnatakaFloorTest just showcases everything that's wrong with our 'democracy'. Sad how 'voter aspirations' become tradable commodities that are up for bidding post elections. Been happening for far too long. Seeing BJP supporters justifying this shit was most depressing.

87 2018-05-19 15:42:04 Fekulal cost of all basic commodities is rising daily... yes daily not monthly... is it a government of common man or plan to finish common man so that rich can enjoy acche din...
88 2018-05-19 15:41:39 I very much see both sides of the coin here.  I also value sources & other people’s time and efforts. Facts, objectivity and critical thinking are hot commodities.
89 2018-05-19 15:35:03 When commodities are in backwardation its a sign of fundamental tightness. Flip to contango is generally a precursor that the curve might have a shift down
90 2018-05-19 15:32:45 Why isn’t fact that they’re talking about distributing PEOPLE qua commodities the only point anyone’s making? How isthere “another side”?

93 2018-05-19 15:20:40 Por isso, deve-se dosar. BTC é investimento sim, assim como ouro, outros metais e commodities. Não é pq não tem fluxo de caixa, que  não se trata de investimento.

94 2018-05-19 15:12:12 Consider investors in either securities or commodities/FX. Either the SEC or CFTC force companies dealing with such investors to disclose one very small and clear disclaimer on the front page whenever a service is promoted. Same approach could be applied to Google.
95 2018-05-19 15:04:35 Where did you pluck that figure from! My two mid twenties children and most (if not all) their friends are pro Brexit. As youngsters are informed they are shifting toward realisation that the EU is suppressing pay and shifting workers like commodities.

Excelente momento para exportadores brasileiros dessas e outras commodities.
99 2018-05-19 14:24:01 The worst thing that happened to our game is when the leaders who treat young people as commodities realized they needed to disingenuously fake being about growth, relationships, and the whole person... don’t believe twitter, young people.

101 2018-05-19 14:09:19 he's an idiot. there iS a middle ground. People just haven't found it yet. However, it is odd to hear high status women who always treat men like commodities complain about men who treat women like commodities.
102 2018-05-19 14:03:13 If you don't know, you are a major part of the Patriarchal and misogynystic problem. Women are not commodities to be bought and sold and neither are young men. If they have to turn to prostitution to survive, then the political system is wrong, the society corrupt and abusive.

105 2018-05-19 13:49:08 What's hilarious to me about this recent debate about the losers in a supposed system of the "distribution" of sex is that the people wringing their hands about usually have scorn for anyone's concern about unfair distribution of actual resources and commodities and wealth.

108 2018-05-19 13:32:32 But where is VIKAS?? Petrol diesel price touching to sky leading price rise of all essential commodities. RS being lower to lowest against dollar.Un employment increased.
109 2018-05-19 13:32:28 Absolutamente de acuerdo
Por eso el peor pecado del anterior gobierno fue no aprovechar los años de commodities a precios record (soja a usd 700 la ton, hoy a 200...)
Para reconvertir el modelo productivo del pais
110 2018-05-19 13:27:45 It's not just Arnab.  From stock exchange to many middle class folks are sad today. Citizens refused to be commodities.. He kya ho raha hai
111 2018-05-19 13:20:27 Middle class expects minimum sops but BJP,  read Jaitely, doesnt even bat an eyelid. Minimum things like favourable IT slabs, cheap public transport and cheaper essential commodities to name a few. This is their votebank and they decieve them.
112 2018-05-19 13:04:48 Rick, let’s keep a level “trading” field for US commodities and, when appropriate, work to eat programs sound progressive.
113 2018-05-19 12:46:21 Not sure this is how it works, but true that the top of the food economics chain is (in the U.S.) commodities. But, Big Commodity doesn't care what we do with corn & soy (eat it, feed it to critters, make it into other stuff, throw it away straight off), as long as we buy it.
114 2018-05-19 12:37:03 You are not right about that. Blockchain can CUT costs in logistics, internacional commodities Trading, billion dollars impact. In Brazil se spend a Lot of money with documents. Blockchain canal solve that, better than a centralized database.
115 2018-05-19 12:36:42 Yep. Commodities represent ~80% of inflation volatility.
116 2018-05-19 12:30:48 my take .allow them free for poaching.  let the country know who are those commodities available for sale  it will be last time they can sell themselves
117 2018-05-19 12:18:17 do we talk abt commodities trading in less than Rs Crs anymore ??? 
118 2018-05-19 11:59:46 CROOKED  LEAR CAPITAL
This  dishonest and conartist group sells
Silver and gold coins  plus other commodities
at above market prices and offer to buy at way 
 below market. Don't deal with these crooks.
They will Rob you blind !!!!!!
119 2018-05-19 11:56:43 At this juncture whom to invite for making government then ? Allmost all politicians are opportunist..all are bhai Behan. It's only the conflict of interest theirs that saved this country, if they have collective then common man will be sold like commodities

122 2018-05-19 11:23:53 Especially with all the ugly talk about women as commodities to be given in marriage to stop lonely men from murdering or “enforced monogamy”. It’s nice too see the love between them and hear a religious leader y’all of love’s importance to god in marriage
123 2018-05-19 11:13:30 The business owner doesn’t actually *create* the commodities or resources that he profits off. Business owners just get people to do that for them and then take profits. I’m sure it’s hard work organising thousands of people to make millions upon millions for you LOL
124 2018-05-19 11:10:16 I don't at all perceive you as a 'man-hater,' and I couldn't agree more that an assertion like the one in the article above is degrading to both men and women. Such statements make men into animals and women into commodities. Dehumanizing and gross are good words for it.
125 2018-05-19 11:10:04 To me it doesn't make sense to trade FX strategies without symmetrical long/short entries. FX pairs, as opposed to stocks and commodities, should behave the same way on both the long and short side. I think it's curve fitting. Don't you think?
126 2018-05-19 11:08:10 Advocating that women making choices about who their partners will be is "destabilizing the sexual marketplace" -- making women into commodities -- is definitely misogyny.

129 2018-05-19 10:51:32 Inflation is determine by the prices of a commodities and other stuffs Likes producer price index, fuel prices, etc. Nothing has declined in it's but the government keeps on telling us that inflation is going down does this make sense? Only a stiff necked fool will believe this.
130 2018-05-19 10:36:20 CME lumber suffers from both low volume and open interest, average daily volume of around 500 contracts.  Only suitable for small traders/low AUM participants. Rule no 1. Avoid "illiquid" commodities. Lumber qualifies as one.
131 2018-05-19 10:24:43 Right-wing nuts think women are commodities and that sex is something that should be distributed equally. Liberals think relationships are commodities and that emotions should be “performed” equally. Both right-wing and liberals swear they are well-meaning and sane individuals.
132 2018-05-19 10:15:25 I would never try to do voluntary work again. This keeps happening. Ppl treated like disposable commodities. You are not valued or respected
133 2018-05-19 10:14:32 It's incel bullshit that reduces people to commodities. it's textbook dehumanisation and then they're surprised when men who have been taught to dehumanise people commit horrific acts of violence
134 2018-05-19 10:12:03 Affordable and convenient way to trade commodities and indices

136 2018-05-19 09:52:10 The "sexual marketplace." Because that's not going to make women seem like commodities for sale.
137 2018-05-19 09:48:52 Will you be able to hold forward/futures positions in commodities? New civil regulations are being drawn up to limit exchange access to ‘financial professionals’ - so that’s hardly anyone ‘in finance’ currently.
138 2018-05-19 09:21:53 “Sexual marketplace”

World’s oldest profession and all that but I didn’t realise we’d all become commodities. 

How naive of me.
139 2018-05-19 09:15:29 Wallace Shawn, the Sicilian from The Princess Bride, is apparently a Socialist. I'm listening to an ep of the Intercepted podcast, and he just dropped the fetishization of commodities into his conversation.

142 2018-05-19 08:50:42 It does appear that  #NRocks18 reminds everyone that education should have a soul, conscience and that children are important and not merely commodities.
143 2018-05-19 08:49:44 In the name of #Democracy, should we waste 100s of crores rupees and vote in criminals, thugs, hijackers, shameless commodities to be bought/ sold? #KarnatakaFloorTest #BJP #BJPChor100Crore #Congress #JDS
144 2018-05-19 08:41:53 @sanjana, I do agree your dialogue and me too on same page. Today we pay 85 Rs./ liter petrol, & non of the ruling government don’t think of us then why should we vote who can’t control commodities which is our daily need. Pathetic government.
145 2018-05-19 08:16:55 “Yes, it is a peculiar market in which most of the people responsible, including the president, view low prices as a threat.”

This quote exposes @drvox ‘s limited understanding of economics. Suppliers of basic commodities and their gov reps ALWAYS worry about LOW prices

152 2018-05-19 07:44:47 That's why when I talk about slavery and black people I revert back to Commodities of goods and services. Black people are still slaves today when it comes to the prison system and how they looked upon in the system.
153 2018-05-19 07:39:42 Honeybunch, I'm old and had hoped this type of mentality had become extinct.  Women are people, dearie, not a sexual resource.  Make women into commodities and expect to see more men dying of poisoning.

159 2018-05-19 06:37:27 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.
160 2018-05-19 06:33:11 So we are now commodities ba?
161 2018-05-19 06:23:31 In that economic model, the commodity is the woman, Patrick. Not the sex. Perhaps I should have emphasized:

> Most commodities are raw materials [...]

Please do not tell that to Ross Douthat.
162 2018-05-19 06:22:49 Men are also commodities within the same market, duh
163 2018-05-19 06:21:08 It's so gross. Let's make genuine issues jokes and commodities
164 2018-05-19 06:18:53 If the dollar actually was based on certain commodities like bread for example it would inflate into oblivion because really most bread is thrown away to keep the price relatively stable to counter of overproduction.
165 2018-05-19 06:17:23 All forms money is backed by something. Historically money was backed by commodities such as gold. Now in USA for example it is backed by Government's promise to pay/decree i.e. fiat money. When u relate ALL money 2inflation, u can't say this one is bad and the other is not.
166 2018-05-19 06:13:47 If distrusting a barbaric, medieval authoritarian religion that degrades women & treats girls like commodities in which to trade between the adult men in different families as Islam does, means I am "Islamaphobic" then so be it, I am Islamaphobic. And I am happy to say so!
167 2018-05-19 06:09:02 Stocks in huge bull mkt. GDP steady. Commodities soaring. No recession 2018 or probably 2019.
168 2018-05-19 05:59:41 Yes - if price of commodities rise
169 2018-05-19 05:37:46 It's not the incels who call it sexual marketplace, it's the guys who have actually dated a lot of women that understand that the system as a whole is lot like a marketplace. Women generally view men as commodities. You have to bring something to the table to be worth dating.
170 2018-05-19 05:37:01 To jest naturalne bo ogromna część cen gazu jest  zawieszona na ropie, cała Azja,
To są energy commodities, więc oczywiście koszyki, ale też ekwiwalent energetyczny - surowce ze sobą konkurują (np węgiel i gaz choćby w EU)
Natomiast jak grają inwestorzy to nie powiem, bo nie gram
171 2018-05-19 05:33:03 All of the commodities we have in the US, and I still somehow manage to hate living here. Our country has become such a shit hole. Nice!
172 2018-05-19 05:19:35 This Karnataka election once again proves that our elected representatives are none less than commodities.
They are purchased, they are bought, they are sold.
Is this what democracy is ?
As a voter anybody will feel cheated.
#KarnatakaElections #Karnataka
173 2018-05-19 05:14:29 your madam Sonia Gandhi is responsible for all this. You guys don't have confidence and trust in your MLAs.u consider them as poachable commodities and even they r shameless enough to go thru all this ordeal.why didn't Cong  keep them free and let their conscience decide 4 them?
174 2018-05-19 05:12:49 MLAs are like commodities in Election Bazaar #karnatakapolitics
175 2018-05-19 05:11:17 #KarnatakaFloorTest What kind of society do we live in if human beings have to be locked up in the name of democracy? It proves that politicians in India are like commodities to be bought and sold. These commodities govern us using the our money! Disgusting!!
176 2018-05-19 05:10:18 The solution for high prices is ... high prices. Remember all the experts just s few years back “we will never see oil under $100 again in our lifetime”. Commodities cycle.
177 2018-05-19 05:07:49 Give some respect to the MLAs . They public figures . Have followings . Have their choices . Please do not treat them like commodities @navikakumar @sardesairajdeep @RShivshankar @republic @INCIndia .
178 2018-05-19 04:58:54 Are all MLAs saleable commodities that they are kept under strict confinement? An aspersion on their character and honesty.
179 2018-05-19 04:56:59 Are these MLAs saleable commodities?

181 2018-05-19 04:48:37 I lean towards known commodities more often than not, Urias still have great upside, average is severely underrated. Graterol/Ruiz are both in A ball with a massive range of possibilities.

183 2018-05-19 04:38:23 I didn't put commodities, art, or real estate on these charts. Still trying to wrap my head around how I'd fit them in. The main goal was just to fit in banknotes and bitcoin.
184 2018-05-19 04:26:33 May be she has the itching of seeing luxurious and pompous occasions where lots of commodities , money and manpower are wasted.
185 2018-05-19 04:23:06 “Sexual marketplace”? Marketplace implies goods/services to be bought or traded. So women are now commodities?  Of course this discourse is labeled as misogyny. It IS.
186 2018-05-19 04:03:21 That's probably because describing access to female bodies as commodities in marketplaces is misogyny.
187 2018-05-19 03:55:44 @eikebatista as commodities internacionais que estão vinculadas à moeda americana. “Todas as áreas que dependem de importação de insumos, produtos ou manufaturados que vêm do exterior, por exemplo, os componentes básicos da indústria farmacêutica, o trigo importado, vemos também

Libertarians today: Women should be distributed among men like commodities to keep inferior men with nothing to offer in a relationship from killing people!
191 2018-05-19 03:39:11 Sexual marketplace? Marketplace? Women (and men) are not commodities to be bought and bartered for. Human beings do not exist so that other humans can purchase and exploit them at will. Treating people as objects to be bought is the definition of dehumanization.
192 2018-05-19 03:38:21 Let's get gas prices in check. A great start would be removing crude oil from the Commodities Market. They can invest in products rather than oil.
193 2018-05-19 03:22:39 thing is, there is no 'sexual marketplace' peoples bodies, and their intimacy are not commodities. People who don't understand that they do not have a right to access to another person's body are a part of the problem.
194 2018-05-19 03:15:50 TBH, the only known commodities for me on this team were Fleury and James Neal.  Hindsight is 20/20, but it is remarkable what the Knights are doing.
195 2018-05-19 02:57:06 Technology is evolving based on human behaviour and we are the biggest and the best commodities for business so they have figured out all of it.

197 2018-05-19 02:42:34 Vamos lá, a economia no governo Lula cresceu sim, mas independente dele. O superávit fiscal alcançado a muito custo e a entrada da China como compradora no mercado de commodities foram as razões do crescimento econômico do Brasil e da maioria das economias periféricas.

199 2018-05-19 02:28:18 Andy Stanley says the same thing, men are socialized to treat women as commodities taken on and off the shelf. #RealTime
200 2018-05-19 02:28:17 Fair. On d economy, we were hard hit by a recession in 2015, govt claim we just exited d recession but prices of commodities suggest otherwise as living standards are still high with our citizens having one of d lowest per capita income in d world. Although, we're a rich country.
201 2018-05-19 02:19:24 Sure it can, and it sucks. But turning that into a function of a pseudo-economic category of “low-status men” reduces all those things - sex, affection, companionship - to commodities to be competed for or redistributed.
202 2018-05-19 02:13:17 Não foi feito em 14 anos, durante o grande boom das commodities, onde todos os emergentes estavam nadando na grana, fica meio obvio que não vai ser feito agora nessa crise desgraçada que PT, PMDB e PSDB nos enfiaram, quem sabe daqui a 20 anos voltemos ao patamar de 2002.
203 2018-05-19 01:56:54 Beats are like commodities, when you dont have any you miss them
204 2018-05-19 01:32:56 Sexual "marketplace?"  Like where you buy animals?  Or commodities? Or objects?
205 2018-05-19 01:27:24 In a vacuum yes, but not comparatively to other currencies- which is what matters. It’s value has declined due to inflation and increasing completion for commodities from the rest of the developing world.
206 2018-05-19 01:25:47 that's the part that drives me! these ppl pretend they are all about the "lower class" yet tax the shit out of the commodities they use most. resulting in less disposable income and a worst off standard of living.

Want to help those lower on SocEcon scale, (-) their tax burden
207 2018-05-19 01:21:41 If the growth narrative in real, this  booming economy should bring huge demand for #commodities like #Copper and #CrudeOil, but because I'm a pessimist, I don't believe this narrative one bit. Also the reason I continue to hold #Gold & gold #miners as insurance and as a hedge.
208 2018-05-19 01:07:49 What was the March, April, May bitcoin CBOE settlement price? Around 8200 area. Price moved to 6400 and 9985 but settlement was in this area. We have noticed this pattern in some Forex & Commodities too. How to use this pattern in crypto?Well I am still new here but working on it
209 2018-05-19 01:02:47 A Nova Zelândia é um país agrícola e é riquíssima. Austrália idem. Até a Alemanha tem perfil exportador de commodities agrícolas.

211 2018-05-19 01:01:23 Definitely...and that's what Ross Douthat was trying to float too, as if human beings are commodities. It's too cute by half.
212 2018-05-19 01:00:22 impossible. Congress ke DNA mein hi corruption hai. Congress MLAs are best selling commodities, no wonder Karnataka ranks 1 in corruption in India.

214 2018-05-19 00:37:34 Yes Ontario under deeper socialism..i'm looking forward to wait in lineups for commodities such as toilet paper is they do in Venezuela
215 2018-05-19 00:18:28 We need to show our farmers how much we appreciate their labors both physical and mental!! The trade agreements need to be overhauled to give our commodities a fairer deal!!
216 2018-05-19 00:15:35 Children, to have their pregnancies covered, to be in the Women, Infants, and children program for more supplemental food, commodities, and farmer's market checks and my Mother gets $12 dollars a month! I am serious friend. I want you and anyone reading this to go down to your
217 2018-05-19 00:07:51 Yep, the future of food = quality, local/regional, differentiated, non-commoditized (spoiler: most commodities aren't really commodities anyway).

231 2018-05-20 22:51:44 Even 8 dollars a gram wholesale seems very high.  Cannabis is proving to be like every other commodity with large price fluctuations.  Commodities tend to over shoot price both on the way up and down so you could see lower prices from here.
232 2018-05-20 22:42:51 Hey hey hey. Do you know what would be really cute? If we stopped treating women and girls like commodities to be appraised, marketed, consumed, and tossed aside.

252 2018-05-20 22:35:47 “Human relationships are not commodities” - a post on Twitter
253 2018-05-20 22:27:37 The expansion rules got them a competitive team. Fleury and Neal and maybe a couple of others were proven commodities so it was not a given they would win, especially go this far.
254 2018-05-20 22:22:57 We are all commodities now.
255 2018-05-20 22:16:09 As much as I LOVE the Stock Market $ES_F... I still prefer #Commodities > #Stocks. Specifically #Metals like #Gold $GC_F #Silver $SI_F & #Copper $HG_F. I also don't think #Oil $CL_F or RBOB #Gasoline $RB_F are done... Lastly, the #Grains: Soybeans $ZS_F Corn $ZC_F Wheat $ZW_F.
256 2018-05-20 22:15:56 Don't worry, they do. They only see women as commodities. They don't care what your orientation is.
257 2018-05-20 22:10:13 Do you think Peterson thinks that human relationships are commodities? I think your criticizing a straw man that you made up.
258 2018-05-20 22:03:19 Why do they teach undergrads about signs + signifieds with saussure and not marx on prices + commodities.
259 2018-05-20 22:02:56 2. You'd be surprised that there is a a way to look at illicit flows of goods. Smuggling not exclusively to drugs but many other commodities. Documents on these did not conform to previous pattern. Also interviewed other officials and they said it's base on "intelligence reports"
260 2018-05-20 22:00:46 Hmmmmm.... #gold only performs well against other commodities in financial crises. #Platinum & #palladium are, anyway, more industrial (Diesel wars killing Pt).
As for #Silver, who knows - brief substance highs & lengthy cold turkey interludes.
261 2018-05-20 22:00:46 But aren't non-men just commodities? Lol

263 2018-05-20 21:55:01 But my Kannadiga sources are like me, who get perturbed by ideological and identity issues, and never ever discuss prices of essential commodities. Its possible they see Karnataka in their image

265 2018-05-20 21:41:01 "Explosive"=Click-bait. I think "the plan" is to devalue the USD into prosperity. Not sure it will be graceful - given commodities rising from decade-lows, pulling yields up + USD with it - but I do not see inflation spiking USD without China's help. Selfish interests must align.
266 2018-05-20 21:34:41 Time+Energy = Are the Most Important Commodities we all have....

268 2018-05-20 21:22:54 In other news, women are reduced to their role as commodities as a decaying capitalism gradually turns to neofeudal praxis. I'm not joking and dudes should be wary whenever a buddy of theirs mentions JBP or the like. Feminism's fighting uphill as it is, even without reactionaries
269 2018-05-20 21:18:04 And some Tolex fans brain,  hackers around Ooooohhhhhhh pls protect ur commodities 
270 2018-05-20 21:17:04 Tumblr and Twitter have made you believe there are more people yearning for a Marxian analysis than there really are. People are content with their lust, greed, and useless commodities.
271 2018-05-20 21:04:22 I find the ebbs and flows of global commodities markets to be mystifying at times, but I always appreciate how they reflect the way that global powers rely on each other in ways that subverts other bickering at times.
272 2018-05-20 20:52:37 RE constant new commodities and new frontiers for capital, see Rosa Luxemburg, The Accumulation of Capital, that is where my thinking on this always begins. For newer analysis connected to this I love Molly Doane's work on Accumulation by Conservation!
273 2018-05-20 20:38:56 Everyone has agency in villages, sports leagues, social clubs, and other forms of human association. "Marketplace" is specifically where things are bought and sold. It treats human relationships/sexual encounters as commodities.
274 2018-05-20 20:29:11 Beats are like commodities, when you dont have any you miss them
275 2018-05-20 20:12:28 Seriously, dude, you need Oxygen to live. It’s literally the highest utility out of all the commodities. How much? I’m selling.
276 2018-05-20 20:09:04 Oh and btw a lot of your ancestors also traded your ancestors to the Europeans for commodities as part of the slave trade so make sure you hate yourself while you’re at it...the historical blame game is such a blast isn’t it?
277 2018-05-20 19:58:48 I think the introduction of GDPR will begin to change our perception of international trade as it does not only relate to commodities but largely focuses on data in this era.
278 2018-05-20 19:48:15 newsflash: all commodities are governed by supply and demand. there is nothing else "backing" the value of anything.
279 2018-05-20 19:41:10 "A wet ass and a dry pocketbook don't go together."

If you ascribe to this idea in any form, on some level you are complicit in the system that views women as commodities.
280 2018-05-20 19:40:30 Also, studios get flack for not investing in new commodities and instead saturating market with comic hero's but you know what? Most of these heros the public doesn't know
281 2018-05-20 19:37:52 That’s assuming there is no triangular trade; I believe there is. US heartland unavoidably produces lots of commodities.
282 2018-05-20 19:35:51 I'd agree totally. When they started referring to the departments as "human resources" that was an instant alarm bell - people aren't resources or commodities. They're people, end of.
283 2018-05-20 19:34:13 And to throw gas on the fire of the inherent misogyny, having people view relationships as commodities reduces their ability to have deeper and fufilling relationships with everyone. They've limited themselves to only a specific subdued romantic view that's exclusively harmful.
284 2018-05-20 19:33:19 No no no, I definitely didn't mean the totalitarian and barbaric thing that I've already suggested previously in my talks and tweets, I mean an equally oppressive idea that would equally out me as a sick reactionary who sees women's lives as commodities to manipulated
285 2018-05-20 19:29:31 What if this is only, like, early late stage capitalism? How many more meaningless commodities in how many more artificial markets can we support before environmental annihilation?
286 2018-05-20 19:28:41 Please fight for Petrol and diesel prices government is taxing too much on these commodities they should reduce 75% tax
287 2018-05-20 19:16:23 I am still not sure why assets vs. commodities should be the analytical framework here...as opposed to, say, comparing commodity production to services....around which, of course, there is a huge literature on as to whether these services are productive or unproductive...
288 2018-05-20 19:07:12 Ah. i see the point you were making. just commodities.
289 2018-05-20 19:07:03 Dear Honourable  PM plz Roll back the fuel price
Otherwise  the poor&middle class can not afford  such a great hike in petroleum products 
I would like to suggest u to keep ur promise against the price hike of essential commodities if u claim to be the pro poor government 
Plz,
290 2018-05-20 19:00:03 for us, we don't pay attention to it, rather we pay attention to the reports by the commodities and #Futures #trading commission
291 2018-05-20 18:56:25 WTF is the "sexual marketplace"?  Are sexual partners and romantic relationships commodities?
292 2018-05-20 18:51:00 #PTI100DaysAgenda I hope PTI gives details on how they will fix market commodities prices, substandard quality of things/medicine on line of FDA(US), sewage system and increase Libraries across country among other things.

296 2018-05-20 18:45:54 One intentional fib that gained Campbell seats in the North was the handoff of #BCRail. Classic bait and switch with huge payoff to insiders. Harmful to all northern resource communities as commodities pile up waiting for rail service.
297 2018-05-20 18:37:59 Lowe's definitely sells imported wood. Not sure what all price points they have, but certain countries have been known to dump low priced commodities into the American markets to grab market share, disrupt the market.
298 2018-05-20 18:30:37 U.S. settling for being commodities exporter to technologically advancing China is NOT going to MAGA. U.S. as 3rd World type commodities producer in agriculture and energy does not advance U.S. long-term interests. @realDonaldTrump @IngrahamAngle @USTreasury @LouDobbs
299 2018-05-20 18:06:51 “Trickle down” started with Ronald Reagan, and began a long, deliberate, strategic, well-funded plan to change from a producing to a financializing society.  People became the disposable commodities; sensitive social issues used as a ing tool.
300 2018-05-20 18:04:40 Important to think about issues such as the livelihoods of smallholder farmers who produce agricultural commodities that cannot be cultivated in the UK.  #SocialJustice through #fairwages since #FairTrade is not fair.
301 2018-05-20 17:56:45 Better invest in new technologies as they are driven by technological singularity. It means that they are developing in geometrical progression way. Physical commodities, utilities and old fashioned investment assets growth are driven by linear growth factors. NVDA 1000% in 4y.
302 2018-05-20 17:43:48 True.  
We can talk to mid east and convince for no price increases or rather reduce prices.  Point would be what kind of very useful commodities can we offer them they cant refuse at the lowest rates.  It would work wonders for all.

305 2018-05-20 17:35:51 you mean the economy BUBBLE caused by deregulating wall street and the commodities exchange?
that bubble burst, and millions never recovered
but damn, Wall Street is doing great!
306 2018-05-20 17:34:20 If China can print CNY for imported commodities like the US, it’s FX reserve needs will move towards the US’ over time.  China has 26% of GDP in FX rsvs, US has 0.6% of GDP.  Who will fund structurally rising US twin deficits if FX reserve needs are structurally falling?
307 2018-05-20 17:31:08 The reason China could undercut US manufacturers, among other things including low labor and environment cost, is massive govt subsidies. Now they are exporting excess production capacity to other countries, not only solar but other commodities as well.
308 2018-05-20 17:30:32 I am somewhat ambivalent on this - I'm trying to think through whether rentiership is always necessarily problematic. Maybe capitalists driven by logic of constant growth, while rentiers aren't (+ capitalists need to produce & sell commodities for profit)
309 2018-05-20 17:19:56 Rise in transportation charge effects price of commodities. Isn't it logical..
310 2018-05-20 17:13:33 “.....Beijing and Washington said they would keep talking about measures under which China would import more energy and agricultural commodities from the United States to close the $335 billion annual U.S. goods and services trade deficit with China” <ABC>
311 2018-05-20 17:09:05 Well, yes, but this removes much of the negative connotation around rentiers (as opposed to capitalists). In your talk it was a bit unclear what sets the latter apart from the former: high CapEx vs. little productive activity or the fact that capitalists deal in commodities only.
312 2018-05-20 17:05:39 (4) US solar install and related jobs were booming. Tariffs on imported commodities (may) endanger those projects and jobs.  The total number of jobs in solar construction >> jobs in US solar manufacturing. There was lots of mixed opinions in solar industry folk abt whether 3/x

314 2018-05-20 17:03:35 How can they  "be more explicit that they DON'T view women and women's sexuality as commodities to be allocated to men" if that is exactly the goal of their effort?
315 2018-05-20 17:00:33 oh man you don't know. hate to break it to you, but state ownership does nothing to combat capital in any way. The commodity form is at the core of capitalism and the only thing Stalin did was accelerate the accumulation of commodities in the USSR. Wage labour with a red flag.
316 2018-05-20 16:59:03 Because they are not taught at home to be cognitive thinkers. Long before they get into school. And they are innured with goods and commodities.
317 2018-05-20 16:55:38 Sure they don’t exist for most family farms. The largest corporate farms use almost all of the subsidy money.  This is mainly price control of commodities which benefits large scale farms, and politicians primarily.  Way different from original intention during dust bowl.

321 2018-05-20 16:29:00 In many rural areas, Trump's trade policy (such as it is) can seriously hurt - soybeans already badly hurt - many other agricultural commodities at hug risk

326 2018-05-20 16:01:47 And all for profit. It’s disgusting how some people treat animals as commodities to be used for their own greed. I’m so glad Mollie and Bruce have the life all dogs deserve.

328 2018-05-20 15:51:08 Bring back commodities as POTUS has suggested, that would eliminate Food Stamp fraud....if people are truly hungry they'll take the commodities & cook up meals with them. My friend had a stranger approach him last week to get him to give him cash to use his EBT card, he said NO
329 2018-05-20 15:48:50 The decision to act as a servant leader is really about how you view others. Are people commodities to be used or sacred creations to be valued? #RiseUp18
330 2018-05-20 15:46:48 Just illustrating how much you don't know about the true state of what your trying to comment on. Commodities behave in this fashion. Oil behaves in this fashion more so as it is a unique driver and contributor to national wealth. So as the economy goes so does oil.

333 2018-05-20 15:32:34 The other day China said they would be willing to buy more from the USA. They are referring to unfinished commodities. Not finished goods.

No thanks China.

339 2018-05-20 15:01:31 Rare commodities are worth more than good
340 2018-05-20 14:57:49 I think the ‘relationship’ really does depend on the product vs the service. Even cars are now just commodities (to me) once you know the make/model/spec you want. Things like collecting my car for servicing on time - you can make a big difference and being on time is free!
341 2018-05-20 14:53:08 #OilShock During initial 2 yrs of Modi tenure, excise duty was raised Rs 12 in 2014-2016 when oil was $40 this govt. tries to push common man 2 suicide by inflating daily use commodities cost  This Govt. serves only industrialist by giving them loan &allowing them to run 4m India

343 2018-05-20 14:51:56 Hindus must start similar protests everywhere Hindu temples are under government control. Hindu temples are not mere properties or commodities to be exploited.

344 2018-05-20 14:51:30 In order to streamline the rates of essential commodities, today Mr. Humayun khan Add. Assistant Commissioner Town-1, Peshawar, raided butcher shops on dilzak road and faqirabad and arrested 7 butchers for overcharging and profiteering.
345 2018-05-20 14:44:16 Shocking to c how mny times @narendramodi govt will raise petrol n diesel prices! It's directly related to inflation. Wd rising fuel prices,cost of essential commodities go up too.@narendramodi rule wud be remembered for high cost of fuel,wch hs constantly incrsd financial burden

347 2018-05-20 14:36:29 "Man who believed women's bodies are commodities to be owned and traded murders woman who had a pretty goddamned good reason not to want to have anything to do with him." There, fixed their headline for them. 
348 2018-05-20 14:31:57 Why so panic if petrol/Diesel prices hiked.?
Hike price
Hike cost of transport eg Bus, Trucks, Passenger vehicles, aviation, Railway, sea trasport.
Leads to inflate price of commodities transported through these means.
349 2018-05-20 14:23:19 Women are not commodities to be traded.  Autonomous healthy human beings don't fetishize other human beings as objects.
350 2018-05-20 14:08:01 Did Keynes not look at bonds like he did fx and commodities?
351 2018-05-20 14:07:36 Three years gone. Not a single sound sectoral policy introduced or implemented: health, education, transport and social housing. Economic pressure emanates from these,  more than cost of commodities. We do not concentrate on commodities but on services like telecom,money spinning

354 2018-05-20 14:00:18 The best way to gain value in dynasty is to trade overhyped rookies. Guys like Abdullah and Perkins got people excited, but a year later and their value is shir. People overvalue potential, so take advantage of that. Trade picks and rooks for known commodities.

362 2018-05-20 13:13:53 People need to stop playing games with their children and using them as commodities instead of humans with rights - just because you have a problem with your ex doesn’t mean your kids have to too. Stop bad mouthing someone your kids love and show them how to be adults #fairsystem
363 2018-05-20 13:03:19 To know that Nigerians are Nigeria's problem, during festivals period things should be relatively cheap, but that's when everyone will increase the prices of their commodities, small rainfall drivers would increase transport fare too. Ramadan now we can't eat fruits again.
364 2018-05-20 12:59:54 Essential commodities can be brought n bullock carts. Wat an idea sir ji. :)
365 2018-05-20 12:54:07 It’s not a mental illness. There is no underlying biological reason for deciding that (at least) half the human population are commodities. It’s a terrorist cult, they need removal from the public and deprogramming.
366 2018-05-20 12:49:39 Tons of bullish articles over the weekend about #commodities and #energy stocks.  Astoria allocated to both last year.  We are forward looking in our approach and we simply love buying cheap assets.
367 2018-05-20 12:43:21 What is the Farm Bill? "Congressional Research Service came out with a report and said that 94 percent of farm program support went to just six commodities—corn, wheat, rice, soy beans, cotton, and peanuts—and they only account for about 28 percent of the production."
368 2018-05-20 12:41:48 America's trade deficit with China is a distraction from fundamentals. It could be eliminated in 30 seconds.

How? 

China buys $400B of US commodities and resells them, at cost, to other nations.

America's bilateral deficit disappears, but its global deficit would not change.
369 2018-05-20 12:34:37 To some of them, the most deluded, they may actually feel like this, as they have been alienated with the idea of women as commodities that they consider 2d equal to 3d.
Doesn't mean it's right, but what they're doing is not totally inexplicable and just to belittle real tragedys
370 2018-05-20 12:29:00 Projections are a different approach - team and role based. Hyde/Johnson are proven commodities with specific roles for the Browns. Chubb will be over time. The Colts backfield feels more wide-open to me. Mack - less of a sure thing.
371 2018-05-20 12:28:20 If we understand anything about the commodity, its that its existence depends on the autonomy of exchange value. Commodities are created for the purpose of selling. Thats there use. It seems to be the same case w/art. The “uselessness” of art seems to justify its commondification

378 2018-05-20 11:36:17 The more you consume, the less you live. Commodities are the opium of the people.
379 2018-05-20 11:29:20 Most people on Earth live in a “Poor” country and its even worst for them.  But if you allow people to acquire HUGE wealth quickly, they will find a way to expand the amount of commodities in the world.
380 2018-05-20 11:14:32 I know. It’s sickening, this trend of young men feeling that they are entitled to whatever woman they choose. Women are not commodities, they are human beings.
381 2018-05-20 11:01:55 If distrusting a barbaric, medieval authoritarian religion that degrades women & treats girls like commodities in which to trade between the adult men in different families as Islam does, means I am "Islamaphobic" then so be it, I am Islamaphobic. And I am happy to say so!

Has #ModiGovt. Brought down the prices of #commodities as compared to 2014?
383 2018-05-20 10:53:51 Shocking 2 see how mny times Modi  will raise #petrol n #Diesel prices! It's directly related to inflation. Wd rising fuel prices, cost of essential commodities go up too. Modi rule wud be remembered for high cost of fuel,wch hs constantly incrsd financial burden on common ppl
384 2018-05-20 10:47:58 Foolish fellows they have raised the fuel price in many folds since they came to power. They could not control prices of commodities. Still some people are praising Modi for his idiotic rule.

386 2018-05-20 10:40:11 Historically, there has been a bull market in the commodities every 20 or 30 years.
387 2018-05-20 10:35:14 And so does modernity where they are sexual commodities
388 2018-05-20 10:13:46 What about the provision of 2 crores jobs to the Indian youth per annum? What about the price of the general commodities?
389 2018-05-20 09:59:53 energy and agricultural commodities
390 2018-05-20 09:58:20 No quick solution and we cannot reverse dramatically. As you say it would be devastating. Focus on new options. Moving away from commodities will be a slow process and many will chose not to but if we want family farms etc. we need to match products, markets routes to farm scale.
391 2018-05-20 09:42:09 Great article,  ofcause  you shouldn't  need to change sex for friendship but it gets the point across. Friendships and relationships  are not commodities  to be distributed, if you try they become the same as the sex workers Incels do not want. Women are humans,its that simple

393 2018-05-20 09:26:26 Why isn’t there a push by media to reduce Excise duty?! Some State Govts have reduced VAT. Price rise of commodities, commuting and hotel food is imperative and ailing for common man. Industries are not left behind either
394 2018-05-20 09:24:03 Yes, thats the issue...United shouldnt be in the market for new fullbacks and another midfielder, they should be looking to buy a house to the manager who lives in a luxury hotel with all the commodities in the world...
395 2018-05-20 09:21:31 Modi government increased tax 9 times when prices hit all time low, instead of giving the benefit to people . So that would be a good place to start. And petrol and diesel are essential commodities , so price dont decide demand . And you are right "success" is always debatable
396 2018-05-20 09:21:21 Looks like our rural commodities will be staying inland
397 2018-05-20 09:01:17 What about other commodities prices

Copper.... Aluminium.....Steel......

All went up

Liquor, Ciggerte & Bidi....all went up

Consumer Income also went up

400 2018-05-20 08:26:35 Khangress & JDS MLAs are saleable commodities which is very well known within Khangress & JDS that is why they kept moving in bus & resorts. Khangress & JDS Leadership does not trust their  MLAs, what a shame. 
Untrustworthy combination
401 2018-05-20 08:23:56 ¿Ventajas comparativas?
Pensé que eran competitivas.
Son: bajos sueldos (10 dólares al día), sindicatos laxos y a modo, acuerdos comerciales, esquema fiscal de importación temporal a commodities, rápido procesamiento aduanal, acceso a los principales océanos...¿Puedo ser presi?
402 2018-05-20 08:15:49 Hon. Minister it is a humble request to to you, kindly reduce taxes on petroleum products which has become the milich cow for all government state and centre total tax paid is more than income tax paid by common man as it has cascading effect on all commodities
403 2018-05-20 07:36:22 No conspiracy .
 More than 15 lakhs in every account of those who voted for modi. The respect for India by the world is worth more than 15 lakhs.

Ujjwala yojna is  for poor Indians.

We get cheap essential commodities so no worries about petrol price.
404 2018-05-20 07:34:04 During his time the price of commodities were low,  dollar exchange rate was in its lowest... Look at the best infra in the country they were made during Marcos time... Ask your parents they know them... They gave Marcos during his last years in the service,  not the whole.
405 2018-05-20 07:14:15 To presume that congress and jds members are saleable commodities is an outright insult to them and makes them vulnerable to switch party in future.

407 2018-05-20 07:06:26 Although, fuel prices has gone up, Service tax from restaurants has come down to just 5%. Many daily commodities have their priced reduced bcz of Reduced GST rates. Inflation has been kept under 4%. These things are obviously good for Middle class people like me.
408 2018-05-20 06:52:32 This has happened only now earlier it was directly proportional , as soon as petrol prices hiked the price of all essential commodities and fares were hiked with no time wasted.
409 2018-05-20 06:38:00 Women are nonentities. Sex robots are commodities.  Involuntary celibate makes are being recognized as pitied upon and there’s a market to treat it with a sex doll as if it’s supposed to prevent any dangers towards voluntarily celibate women or all women who decline (1
410 2018-05-20 06:33:59 When dont know about Excise duties do some reading rather just blabbering like a moron ,a tax levied on certain goods and commodities produced or sold within a country and on licences granted for certain activities thats defination of central Excise duty.
411 2018-05-20 06:25:59 We waited enough and seen enough.. Modi is a total failure.. right form demonetization to GST.. GDP is low and the prices of commodities are at their record high.. Not even a single trade deal has been signed with a renknown country.Dollar value with INR is at its record high..
412 2018-05-20 06:24:48 Capitalism thrives on your addiction, it thrives on your weakness in the face of its tantalizing, poisonous, commodities.
413 2018-05-20 06:17:22 All items should be brought under GST including commodities, this will host tax income and reduce over dependence on some commodities alone
414 2018-05-20 06:04:53 @dpradhanbjp sir we voted for you to bring down oil prices but it seems the govt is more bothered abt winning elections than worry abt common man’s problems...due to high oil prices all essential commodities hv become expensive...plz do something #highoilprices #oilprice
415 2018-05-20 05:59:46 @INCIndia @BJP4Maharashtra  h.e.Governor used his discretionary powers....nothing wrong it...agri.minister permit to import agri.commodities despite India has bumper production of it..based on... Simply greed to earn illicit millions dollats

417 2018-05-20 05:42:48 People think the SNAP program comes out of tax dollars, it doesn't. Farmers are the only ones who support SNAP. Your description of the program is correct and has been the same since it was called commodities program in the late 30's.

419 2018-05-20 05:35:57 Thanks for sharing this.  Great hits as stand alones are commodities these days.  I don't want just a great hit.  I want art.  Art that inspire, engage, and connect are gifts from the artists like them. Not many can pull this off. These guys are true artists. Why? ++
420 2018-05-20 05:30:20 The common man knows very little economics. He may have a big heart, but what affects his daily life are most important to him. Prices of all commodities have almost stabilised. If petrol / diesel can be reigned in, many problems solved. @AmitShah @narendramodi
421 2018-05-20 05:29:58 Now is the time for Modi to do something that can win him immense popular support. His government should reduce GST on petrol and diesel from 28% to 18%. It will bring the prices of these two commodities down to a reasonable level.
422 2018-05-20 05:29:42 Mueller, he has the power of his office as well as the FBI and the courts. I'd be delighted if it was Stormy. I'd dine off of it for a year because tRUMP treats women like commodities, instead of human beings.
423 2018-05-20 05:22:18 What's going on in the Sedibeng municipality? Water and electricity have become scarce commodities in Vereeniging CBD. Does the ANC want to retain this municipality? Is there an administration at all currently?
424 2018-05-20 05:19:32 Agreed. 

At least Peterson’s angle actually tries to speak to young men as if they are more than commodities.

He deals in trying to help young men create an internal sense of dignity, meaning, purpose, and spiritual significance as well.
425 2018-05-20 05:18:42 Most people who get into politics do it for solid reasons, like making a difference for their constituents, and aren't commodities to be bought and paid for. The system could use a tune up but bribing elected officials is illegal; doubtful most would approve
426 2018-05-20 05:06:41 It might as you say mean the entire argument for lower food prices from leaving has collapsed. More likely it means there has been a recent glut in the EU of certain foods causing a temporary price collapse as often happens in commodities. The burden is on @the_tpa to answer.
427 2018-05-20 05:05:27 It's disheartening how the death of 10 people from Canada, France, Germany or a "western nation" will make worldwide news, while the crimes of Israel will never be punished. 

To the powerful nations, the lives of non-whites are commodities.
428 2018-05-20 05:05:14 Fuel prices are sky high ,but then bhakts say it is ok as one who can afford it will purchase.What about increase in commodity prices which affects common man?Then they say fuel prices are not related to commodities. What else we can expect from these so called Modi ke bhakths:-(
429 2018-05-20 05:02:16 Why did u made commodities ready for sale as your candidates first. Now guarding has become a great virtue.
430 2018-05-20 04:28:53 @narendramodi sir, I must say that even with all ur sincere efforts the rates of general commodities has risen drastically
431 2018-05-20 04:27:25 The cause is misogyny, entitlment, thinking of women as commodities. It is self pity, victimhood. It is seeing the world from only their own perspective  and living in that fantasy  that all women are there to service men and attractive men get all the women.
432 2018-05-20 04:26:05 @RadhamohanBJP sir ji when are you going to declare the msp of agri commodities, lot of farmers waiting to plan their kharif crop.
433 2018-05-20 04:15:36 I just want to trade stocks  with a high return, I already targeted  several well-known American companies, I'm expecting at least  50% rise  in a year. I  used to trade commodities  in China, I prefer taking  some risks.
434 2018-05-20 04:07:50 The argument against crypto is always the amount of energy used in its production not a GDP argument. However no one every examines the cost of producing physical currency both in terms of energy and physical commodities.

439 2018-05-20 03:38:38 Sorry i just assumed u meant energy commodities. Thats my experience. Have never traded base metals or agro commodities. Precious metals and energy commodities are the only assets i have traded and understand
440 2018-05-20 03:36:26 The only way to describe Karnataka election is ungraceful the entire affair surely we don't elect people to come to blows like this where is their passion and commitment for creating jobs reducing prices of essential commodities better healthcare and above all national security
441 2018-05-20 03:32:16 Sir how I can increase my knowledge about commodities trading ? Any suggestive reading
442 2018-05-20 03:24:10 But how exactly would exchange between cooperatives work? Surely it'd be too difficult to directly exchange commodities in kind between firms. For things to go smoothly you'd need some sort of universal commodity that measures the value of other commodities ;)
443 2018-05-20 03:23:15 What do Sam aadami does with petrol n diesel? Normally these two commodities r used by automobile users only? Are they use incycles n Bullock or horse cart too? Funny! Is not it?
444 2018-05-20 03:23:12 Till today sir I never gone through such informative tweet on commodities . Thanks a lot for sharing.looking forward for more such information!
445 2018-05-20 03:14:40 Dapat inuna nila ang tax sa mayayamang minero ndi ang tax sa basic commodities
446 2018-05-20 03:02:43 Haha! Would be a pleasure to learn some commodities stuff from the pros. :)
447 2018-05-20 02:55:18 Watching Heat tonight just gave me a great idea, though very illegal… It’d be an amazing racket to run insurance fraud by robbing rich people who buy their commodities back at 60%, where both parties would stand to make a ton of money from arranging the false-flag operation.
448 2018-05-20 02:46:31 But the exchange of commodities is proof of capitalism tho; it implies and/or leads to the existence of wage labor and money. I honestly don't understand why you're so opposed to any analysis based on the idea of the commodity form?
449 2018-05-20 02:42:22 Beats are like commodities, when you dont have any you miss them
450 2018-05-20 02:37:53 "Commodities are the best performing asset class of 2018," @GoldmanSachs quoted in @business on @globeandmail MAY 1, 2018. Commodities markets this year have returned 7 percent, according to the report, compared with a 1 percent dip for equities.
451 2018-05-20 02:31:33 Well I don’t mean normative in some shitty “no sex until your married” sense or whatever, more in the “don’t fuck in ways that reduce the other to a mere instrument or efface their consciousness” sense. By, say, viewing them as commodities...
452 2018-05-20 02:31:21 So this is where you fell, and I am left to sell the path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell right to the top. Don't look back. Turning to rags and giving the commodities a rain check.
453 2018-05-20 02:28:59 Property and commodities remain with the highest bidder! It applies to donkeys and horses also who know which side of the bread is buttered! Now the task is to satisfy them that it pays to remain ‘loyal to the owners’ who are better paymasters!
454 2018-05-20 02:05:30 Simples: Não podemos “exportar” impostos. Além disso, petróleo e seus derivados são “commodities” cujos preços seguem as oscilações do mercado internacional.
455 2018-05-20 02:02:53 Yep. I never said that we were in a great position maintaining stayus quo. But pulling the rug out without a plan will suck for everyone. I believe that $ replacement is inevitable. I would like to see countries back their currency with a big basket of commodities, not just gold.
456 2018-05-20 02:01:35 Well, the US is asking for something meaningless: reduce bilateral trade deficit by increasing purchase of commodities (energy and agriculture) that have a unified world price.  As long as the world price doesn't change, it doesn't matter, so China "agree" is the winning move.
457 2018-05-20 02:00:01 1. Nothing new ever occurs in the business of speculating or investing in securities and commodities.

2. Money cannot consistently be made trading every day or every week during the year.

3. Markets are never wrong – opinions often are.
458 2018-05-20 01:36:39 Mining is a major industry in Nevada? Our minerals compete with commodities from Australia, New Zealand, and Peru?

465 2018-05-20 00:58:37 Lots of young women sat it out. Now their bodies are once again reduced to commodities that others control. I have marched for choice for voting rights for every decent liberal cause. If you are only going to vote when it's Obama or another perfect person you will be screwed

They do so opec and Russian reducing output and increased demand in summer months.. sorry u don’t understand supply and demands nor do u understand how commodities work. Gas prices going up are good bc my GUSH
470 2018-05-20 00:34:07 It means women get to decide who they will have and will not have sex with.

“Sexual marketplace” presents women as commodities - things - with no human rights or autonomy.

let’s remind ourselves: capitalism’s corkscrewing whale dong has pervaded so deep into our collective consciousness that it’s 2k18 and our social media existence is regarded as a “brand,” rendering us mere commodities
473 2018-05-20 00:15:45 When you go to McDonalds you are purchasing easily re-distributed commodities, and the accompanying labor to make those commodities into a consumable product. 
Sex is attached to a person's body, thus cannot be commodified in that fashion.

475 2018-05-20 00:05:33 "bullshit worker" is Graeber, not Marx.  I think you are conflating two or three things: 1) necessary labor (concrete labor time needed to produce the wage share of output);   2) socially necessary labor time (abstract labor time content of commodities of given types). ....
476 2018-05-18 23:59:43 WOMEN  ARE  NOT  COMMODITIES
477 2018-05-18 23:53:37 My reading of "Armed Joy" doesn't lead me to believe that anyone is suggesting a complete end to "production" in the general sense, but the elimination of production in the specific sense as it relates to commodities as non-essential goods.
478 2018-05-18 23:52:31 Commodities and necessities. Defense aid is pretty much what we’re doing now, and idk how much it’s helping—or, at least has helped, historically.
479 2018-05-18 23:40:20 The real issues? I do so every day. The real issues are obvious: If your politicians are bought and sold as commodities, they will never represent you.
480 2018-05-18 23:23:04 your nightly reminder that i come from the stupidest country on planet earth where human lives are commodities and that i am super thankful i no longer have to live there but also can someone scrounge together a german passport for me bitte danke schön hasenpfeffer audi
481 2018-05-18 23:15:59 Stock markets crash. Commodities prices spike on supply shocks. Both lead to articles of the form, "If [unlikely thing] happens, then [horrible consequences]". These arguments can sound convincing, but it's rare anyone takes the time to actually size the odds of [unlikely thing].
482 2018-05-18 23:09:24 What effect would that have on China’s currency reserves? Until the Yuan is completely backed by commodities such as gold, silver, or oil, widespread dumping of treasuries is unlikely, but as soon as enough of the Yuan is commodity backed, the Dollar’s death will be very certain.
483 2018-05-18 23:08:04 There is nothing to debate or address. Peterson thinks women/sex should be redistributed because some men are lonely - tough fucking luck. Women are not commodities.
484 2018-05-18 22:47:50 Aid focused as in purely commodities & necessities or as in defense?
485 2018-05-18 22:35:54 Sim. Busca aí no meu histórico de tweets que explico que o movimento atual entre o dólar x commodities tem muita correlação com o que aconteceu no começo do ciclo 2002/2008.

489 2018-05-18 22:20:58 The loveboaters would have us back at the baby farming days of tuam. They see children as commodities, for all their emoting and sentimentalising.
490 2018-05-18 22:18:53 The title at the top of the chart states that it's the 10yr rolling annualized return for a commodities index.
491 2018-05-18 22:09:39 By removing some of the risk involved with production, this insuring there is always a surplus and cheap raw commodities
492 2018-05-18 22:07:55 What we need is a really stiff tax on every bullet, like we do with cigarettes and gas and other commodities with consequences.
493 2018-05-18 23:59:43 WOMEN  ARE  NOT  COMMODITIES
494 2018-05-18 23:53:37 My reading of "Armed Joy" doesn't lead me to believe that anyone is suggesting a complete end to "production" in the general sense, but the elimination of production in the specific sense as it relates to commodities as non-essential goods.
495 2018-05-18 23:52:31 Commodities and necessities. Defense aid is pretty much what we’re doing now, and idk how much it’s helping—or, at least has helped, historically.
496 2018-05-18 23:40:20 The real issues? I do so every day. The real issues are obvious: If your politicians are bought and sold as commodities, they will never represent you.
497 2018-05-18 23:23:04 your nightly reminder that i come from the stupidest country on planet earth where human lives are commodities and that i am super thankful i no longer have to live there but also can someone scrounge together a german passport for me bitte danke schön hasenpfeffer audi
498 2018-05-18 23:15:59 Stock markets crash. Commodities prices spike on supply shocks. Both lead to articles of the form, "If [unlikely thing] happens, then [horrible consequences]". These arguments can sound convincing, but it's rare anyone takes the time to actually size the odds of [unlikely thing].
499 2018-05-18 23:09:24 What effect would that have on China’s currency reserves? Until the Yuan is completely backed by commodities such as gold, silver, or oil, widespread dumping of treasuries is unlikely, but as soon as enough of the Yuan is commodity backed, the Dollar’s death will be very certain.
500 2018-05-18 23:08:04 There is nothing to debate or address. Peterson thinks women/sex should be redistributed because some men are lonely - tough fucking luck. Women are not commodities.
501 2018-05-18 22:47:50 Aid focused as in purely commodities & necessities or as in defense?
502 2018-05-18 22:35:54 Sim. Busca aí no meu histórico de tweets que explico que o movimento atual entre o dólar x commodities tem muita correlação com o que aconteceu no começo do ciclo 2002/2008.

510 2018-05-18 21:53:26 I’d call all of our crops “commodities” but a few are technically not Title 1 crops.
511 2018-05-18 21:53:02 "After all, you don’t need a pile of bricks to create a humanities academia. You need #time and #thought, and those not coincidentally are the only two commodities that are little offered beneath the contemporary university’s fluttering banners." Guy Rundle in @satpaper
512 2018-05-18 21:44:40 I understand the position, but for the most part I feel like the market is built upon cheap plentiful commodities, there isn’t any law against growing other things right now, just nobody want to pay enough to scale those markets up IMO
513 2018-05-18 21:41:59 Or perhaps, without all the artificial support systems in place, we can choose to grow crops other than commodities, that can actually be more profitable than commodities are right now.
514 2018-05-18 21:33:08 In contemporary Nigeria, good governance would involve addressing the country’s economic stagnation and crisis, including transitioning the economy to a post-oil/commodities trajectory, ensuring security, @atiku
515 2018-05-18 21:27:57 Se vc acredita no ciclo e tem estômago, gosto de Petr, Vale e UNIP (tenho todas) para pegar o ciclo das Commodities. Indiretamente Gerdau é tb uma excelente opção (tenho GOAU).
516 2018-05-18 21:22:06 Something seldom mentioned after these school shootings is anomie.  Kids who have responsibilities and feel needed seldom have the desire or time to carry out something like this. @GOP radical capitalism prolongs childhood to maintain markets turning people into commodities.
517 2018-05-18 21:09:07 3 points and I’m done arguing against a brick wall, I’ve got better things to do. 1- those commodities are a direct link into the inputs of those sectors. 2- you can’t have your cake and eat it arguing for currency weakness then commodity weakness. 3- editorial neutrality 
518 2018-05-18 21:08:49 Ok then if you aware of all these than the price of commodities should go up & not down from the monetary point of view, but taking into consideration oil stocks, rising production, Iran’s discounted price sale of oil to China it can go down. Therefore all depends on EIA reports
519 2018-05-18 20:59:14 It honestly is so hard being around Asians who have such poor views of women/view them as commodities to be bought & sold. But nothing makes me happier knowing one day (InshaAllah) I can have a daughter & raise her differently.
520 2018-05-18 20:56:48 horseshoe theory but the center is "commodities expressing my political ideology"
521 2018-05-18 20:56:46 And this ENTIRE thought is based on the idea that women are commodities, not agents of free will with full rights as autonomous human beings.
522 2018-05-18 20:56:06 "commodities guru"
523 2018-05-18 20:55:26 Sir,
How about Lowering PETRO PRICES by 30pct!? AND also Foods (Nay only Drugs) and Commodities. The "SOURCE" must Not Gouge​ The People and therefore must Adjust their Prices back down accordingly Honestly i.e., WHY do Pizza Stores raise their Price w/N.Y. Subway Prixes: Mafia?
524 2018-05-18 20:46:31 Furthermore inspite of rising FED interest rates, government is lifting debt sealing, increase expenses and will borrow more and more. This situation will turn to devaluation of USD, upward inflation and rising prices of all commodities and assets.
525 2018-05-18 20:37:07 Goldman Sachs says that investors are getting complacent about commodities and could miss out on rare gains fueled by rising oil prices.
526 2018-05-18 20:32:23 I remember reading a theory once about how Adolf Hitler would've won the war if he had mass printed other countries currencies & over inflated their markets & crashed their economies. That is what I believe is happening to us as we speak except it's digital & commodities. 
527 2018-05-18 20:23:00 En el mercado de Chicago, los futuros de los commodities agrícolas     tuvieron una jornada positiva en la que todos ajustaron al alza. El trigo subió a causa de compras técnicas y a los pronósticos que muestran que continuaría la  sequía en Estados Unidos y Australia.
528 2018-05-18 20:11:37 data not as relevant as it is for commodities. Most volume done outside futures market
529 2018-05-18 20:06:07 LOL. I'm giving you examples of Commodities which yes ARE privatized. Good job. Now Public goods =
-Military
-Police
-Fire Dept
-Roads
-etc.

Are you seeing the difference? Health care is NOT a public good. Health care is a commodity
530 2018-05-18 20:02:29 You're making random distinctions. In theory any services or commodities could be privatized or not. You're not coming off as bright as you think you are. Maybe try not being such a dick about it too. 
531 2018-05-18 19:59:03 Whole numbers are big psychological supports for commodities, multiple bounces at $122 for $GLD 5/15 indicating consolidation. RSI showing oversold and Stochastics showing bullish divergence. I suspect a recovery upon a catalyst, but only to $124 at best.
532 2018-05-18 19:58:58 It is time to start making the NRA, gun manufacturers and politicians who support them liable for the mayhem caused by their commodities.
533 2018-05-18 19:58:27 Wow you can't be this stupid.....

PUBLIC GOOD smart ass.

Health care is a commodity.
Food is a commodity.
Water is a commodity. 
Things you BUY are commodities.
534 2018-05-18 19:56:05 These people are SICK! To view our children as expendable commodities to distract and shift a f'n narrative is pure evil.
535 2018-05-18 19:55:03 Good option all round. Certainty is provided. Countries can plan. We can stop letting people die in poorer economies by trading with them directly, not through protectionist EU processors of commodities like coffee.

If EU want to protect their surpluses, they can initiate  talks
536 2018-05-18 19:52:52 What a retired argument. Learn the difference between Public goods and commodities. 

There are very few roles that the federal government was intended to do, you named 3. Good job.
537 2018-05-18 19:50:33 Wouldn’t you know it— I was looking at a chart that included non-ag commodities— my bad
538 2018-05-18 19:49:27 ... Em suma, UM REAL apenas da Vale, fez a roda de 10 ou 15 reais girarem. Commodities representam uma parcela pequena da economia, mas é o q faz a economia sair da lama.

Para quem gosta de analogias automobilísticas, commodities são o nosso motor de arranque.
539 2018-05-18 19:42:33 The day we stop looking at women as commodities the we hv build up or helped is the day men will start healing, we cant continue like this gents, lets change nd i repeat, it starts with me. Speak out nd get help Mfethu, its the right nd only thing to do
540 2018-05-18 19:38:29 Except that’s not what actually happens in cities that have gun control laws.  Research indicates criminals treat guns like precious commodities and are less likely to sell them.
541 2018-05-18 19:35:07 $oil No one can absolutely control the price of oil, silver, gold, and other commodities used & produced all over the world. To some extent yes absolutely no. Supply & Demand has a big influence finally. 
542 2018-05-18 19:30:45 Lmao wait there’s a Canadian professor that speaks in parables about swamp witches to explain that women are sex commodities to be redistributed? And people spend money to talk to him on skype?
543 2018-05-18 19:30:07 Te informa sobre a alta MUNDIAL das Commodities, onde pobre virou emergente, poderíamos ter ficado mil vzs melhor, graças a incompetencia de Lula ficamos em último lugar, à frenre apenas do México nesse crescimento. Cadê a memoria? Praticamente acabamos de viver isso.
544 2018-05-18 19:26:37 It always seem to be the filthy rich who are desperate to remain in the EU. Speaking as a normal non-wealthy person. The EU has done nothing for me except make me pay more for utilities and commodities. Mind you, he does work for the pro EU @BBC

548 2018-05-18 18:48:38 Higher Commodities price is because USD is Dropping even Fed is increasing Rate. S&P500 and Commodities will fly. Shipping Rate will fly. Oil demand is Stable. In order to increase Deman they need to give to each China Man and East Indian Man high quality living standards.
549 2018-05-18 18:48:25 it's a weird bougie mainly white people think. membership to the neighborhood private pool is like a glorified country club but without any commodities. you get to drop your kids off and drive away? i don't understand the appeal tbh.
550 2018-05-18 18:43:39 Marx explains this formula in Capital vol. 2. It means that money (M) is used to purchase commodities (C) which function as capital, ie. means of production and labour-power, which are used in production (P) to produce a commodity of greater value (C) sold for a profit (P).

553 2018-05-18 18:40:08 The “Zionist” tag is just a ruse. None of these govts. have any interest in a political theology that’s only 130 years old. They’re using it to create division amongst the masses. 
The US, UK & Israeli governments are corporatist. 
To them all people are expendable commodities
554 2018-05-18 18:38:37 Nevermind the fact that I have yet to see a single source for this claim that 20% of the alphas are getting 80% of the women... also remember women are P-E-O-P-L-E not commodities.

562 2018-05-18 18:23:32 As the church was to medieval society so schools are to today’s consumeristic society. They teach us to trust the experts, to treat knowledge and other goods as commodities, that we are broken and in need of services, and oppress those without credentialing.
563 2018-05-18 18:21:50 Yup, but still higher commodities prices means higher demand = more shipping = higher shipping rates & less ship availability.

Supply Vs Demand = pricing power
564 2018-05-18 18:16:27 Disagree....major difference in commodities vs luxuries in your example.  Since Fiat will not be used to valuate digital currencies in the future in the above examples then how would you valuate the Rembrandt vs say a gallon of gas or necessity such as food or water?

573 2018-05-18 17:31:36 Commodities have even more intrinsic value than stocks. Commodities are food, energy, the rawest of industrial materials. Those all have value because you can use them on their own. Explain how you can use bitcoin if your electric grid has failed.

581 2018-05-18 17:02:05 We have to admit that in the absence of structured camp management, because of a lack of access or resources or just negligence, people filled that space, which resulted in IDPs being turned into commodities.
582 2018-05-18 16:57:41 Em um ano o salário mínimo teve aumento de R$17,00. Só o gás de cozinha teve aumento de mais de R$ 15,00 e o dólar bateu os R$ 4,00 (e todas as commodities aumentam também).

583 2018-05-18 16:53:04 Following recent extra 10% and 25% import-duty application by USA for Turkish aluminium and iron and steel, Turkey also announced retaliation for 11 US commodities including coal, paper, walnut, almond, tobacco, paddy rice, whiskey, car, cosmetics, mechanicals and petrochemicals.
584 2018-05-18 16:51:31 And the rise of those markets is related to commodities. Commodities induce corruption - but Eurobond markets can turn to London/US courts while equity investors tend to depend on local courts. So equity markets may do better over time in commodity importing countries
585 2018-05-18 16:48:53 There were price spikes on Seventh and Ninth Avenues.  Down around Wall Street, potato futures had a bump on the commodities market.

641 2018-05-18 13:54:24 Copper’s underperformance is especially notable because oil has added 18% this year and hit its highest level since 2014. Oil and copper are two of the most actively-traded commodities, and some investors trade the two together in a single basket.

680 2018-05-18 12:10:25 If the price of oil reduces, it will reduce the price of other commodities as well. More money will remain in peoples hand and the extra buying power will lead to inflation again and that will be disastrous.

703 2018-05-18 10:07:26 I'd expect paying money to different people to alter the prices of different things in hard to predict sometimes counterintuitive ways. I mean, if less money to rich means less manipulation of commodities markets maybe food prices come *down* even while consumption goes up?

717 2018-05-18 08:58:36 Probably worth reading @MH_Investment letter on MLPs #commodities. The 1st argument (abolishing IDRs) is funny. IDRs were never an issue when times were good. The same sell side clowns had IDRs as a positive are  switching them over to the risks section in their primers.

In fact, prices of basic commodities have risen.

720 2018-05-18 08:49:23 Is there any authority/department who control the prices of commodities, do people have fear and follow them
721 2018-05-18 08:40:37 How do you read that?

To me, it's a sign of the "commoditization" of those opportunities. If those opportunities become commodities, then it's a matter of capital and it might stop being a cash-on-cash return and become an absolute cash return.
722 2018-05-18 08:40:19 You are joking? We sell iron ore and other commodities. How much do you want? We’re negotiating an F/T agreement with the EU and already have one with Japan, China, the US and NZ. Our future is in Asia. The most we want from the UK is wedding commemoration mugs and crime TV.
723 2018-05-18 08:40:02 This joker didn’t even know that value of rupee depended on oil and other commodities prices India heavily imports. Oil was ruling > $100/barrel. And US started the great “Taper” sending 10 yr bond yield to 3%

LME copper gained 0.8 percent to $6,879.00 per metric ton.
756 2018-05-18 06:03:25 It’s about time the Govt reigned in on such loopholes. It should go even further & actually prosecute violators of illegal importation of agricultural commodities which undermine our local industries. There’s no sensible reason  imports sugar, seafood etc.
757 2018-05-18 05:42:40 This is true. Dairies are hurting right now. All commodities are down.

764 2018-05-18 05:12:51 And it still would be. When the hard cap is reached, the market value goes up. That's how Commodities work.

You don't curtail it, it just becomes more expensive. As Plex is spent, and more goes back into circulation, it gets cheaper.
765 2018-05-18 05:08:43 Ro, Commodities have a Market cap at any given time. The market sets the value based on that quantity available. If you put a cap on the quantity available, the market price goes up and down based on demand. Commodities get traded. In this case, spent Plex would be replaced.

774 2018-05-18 03:59:20 A blockchain enables the creation of an asset which starts off as a currency, commodity, or security. It can then change form based on how it’s used. I don’t mess with securities. I do commodities and currencies. That’s CFTC and Treasury. Some people slept in civics class. 
775 2018-05-18 03:55:00 The free market only makes this worse by making commodities which have become rare even more valuable, ensuring their disappearance or extinction. Same with vacant crown land & water. Free market = biosphere death. Ponzi scheme.
776 2018-05-18 03:28:10 Commodities Check

West Texas Intermediate crude was up 0.1 percent Friday at $71.55 a barrel.

Brent ended higher for the fifth day, up 0.2 percent at $79.44 per barrel.

Gold was little changed at $1,290.19 an ounce
777 2018-05-18 03:16:26 Well if you’re using a robo then your real estate is coming in the form of equities too, and as for commodities you should read a few papers about how poorly commodity investing works out for individual investors
778 2018-05-18 03:14:29 US Cotton: All commodities are very sensitive to weather. The way Chinese cotton market is rising something seems really amiss with the weather. Also Drought situation in West Texas is not getting any better. Indian cotton sowing  anybody's guess. Cotton about to get Wilder.
779 2018-05-18 03:08:29 Impor sanções contra o Irã significa 2.6mm/barris dia a menos de oferta, o que aumenta o preço do petróleo e o custo de transporte das commodities. Tudo bate na inflação dos EUA e nos juros de L/P, além do equívoco colossal macroeconômico do protecionismo Trumpiano.
780 2018-05-18 03:03:15 Um, minimum wage earners have always been tax excempt, even before the TRAIN law. And those with no fixed income i.e. the poor has never paid taxes. Until now, when they enacted TRAIN and the prices of basic commodities started to inflate.
781 2018-05-18 03:00:45 Are you a commodity broker? Are you a farmer? With farm commodities it is more of a supply driven commodity, not a demand driven commodity. If you have your markets, you don’t want to give them up.

787 2018-05-18 02:44:08 @Scutty interesting to see this, because as much as people think that wages inflation is the downside risk to the budget, I think they're missing the conservative numbers on the commodities prices factored into the model. The latter will have more impact over the short term.
788 2018-05-18 02:38:29 Es verdad, pero la mayor parte son commodities. Nos falta dar el gran salto! El negocio fronterizo trae como anexo mucha mafia, ojala dependamos cada vez menos de eso.

805 2018-05-18 01:02:23 Meu cenário base para o final do ciclo (lá para 2022) é:  Ibov nos 220k, Dólar nos 2,50/2,60 e Oil nos USD 100. Esse é meu chute há muito tempo.
Ruído de curto prazo não muda tendência de LP. Ibov = commodities. Se tem commodities, tem ciclo para Ibov. Não tem pra onde fugir.
806 2018-05-18 00:46:37 1. Final do ciclo de expansão. Commodities, via de regra, são as últimas a se valorizar.
2. Commodities têm preço dolarizado, com o dólar subindo elas se beneficiam ainda mais.
3. EUA estão aumentando os juros. Isso atrai capital para lá e impulsiona o dólar no mundo todo.

812 2018-05-18 00:06:18 Value of real national currencies is GDP, etc. This make crypto value MW capacity. Which is already represented by energy commodities. So yeah, no real value.
813 2018-05-18 00:01:40 So you think commodities traders should be restricted in what they can do. And that you want to put a lid on the price of crude. Sounds like a solid socialist plan, controlling the two major reasons gas prices spike.
